The knowledge of bubble properties, incl uding bubble velocity, bubble size, gas holdup, 
and specific interfacial area, is of impor tance for the proper design and operation of 
bubble columns. A four-point optical probe was adopted in this study to measure bubble 
properties in such systems. An improved algorithm for data processing was developed, 
which extends the capability of the probe and improves the accuracy of the measurement. 
The new algorithm provides both the magnit ude and direction angles of the bubble 
velocity vector. The results from the probe  and the algorithm were validated against 
video imaging and it was established that the bubble velocity distribution, bubble chord 
length distribution, local gas holdup, and speci fic interfacial area obtained by the four-
point optical probe are reliable. 
  
 The four-point optical probe measurements of bubble properties were taken in an air-
water system using a 16.2cm (6.4”) diameter bubble column at elevated pressure, up to 
1.0 MPa, and at high superficial gas velocity, up to 60 cm/s, equipped with three different 
gas spargers. 
 
It was established that gas holdup radial profile s evolve from flat at low superficial gas 
velocity to highly parabolic at high superfic ial gas velocity. Specific interfacial area 
profiles, bubble mean velocity profiles, a nd bubble frequency profiles exhibit the same 
trends. Bubble velocity distributions change from unimodal to bimodal with increase in 
superficial gas velocity. However, only unimodal bubble size distributions were 
observed. The effects of pressure, spargers , and elevation in the column are also 
illustrated. 
 
This study establishes the four-point probe as  a useful tool for study of bubble properties 
in actual bubble columns.  iii

Chapter 1  Introduction 
 
1.1  Motivation 
 
Bubble column reactors are used extensively to  perform a wide vari ety of gas/liquid or 
gas/liquid/solid reactions, such as oxi dation, hydrogenation, ch lorination, aerobic 
fermentation, waste water treatment, and coal liquefaction (De Swart and Krishna, 1995; 
Jager and Espinoza, 1995; Shollenberger et al. , 1997; Eisenberg et al. , 1994; Davis, 
2002). The main advantages of bubble columns over other multiphase reactors (stirred 
vessels, packed towers, trickle bed reactor s etc.) include simple construction, low 
maintenance due to the absence of moving parts,  excellent heat transf er properties, easy 
temperature control, and reasonable interpha se mass transfer rates at low energy input. 
 
The knowledge of bubble properties, includ ing bubble velocity, bubble size, gas holdup, 
and specific interfacial area, is of considerable importance for the proper design and 
operation of bubble columns. For example, the overall mass transfer rate per unit volume 
of the dispersion in a bubble column is governed by the liquid-side volumetric mass 
transfer coefficient (k la), assuming that the gas-side resistance is negligible. In a bubble 
column reactor, the variation in k la is primarily due to variations in the specific interfacial 
area, a. The specific gas-li quid interfacial area, a, is  related to the gas holdup, ε g, and the 
bubble size distribution, while the gas hol dup is determined by the bubble size 
distribution, bubble velocity (i.e., bubble residence time), and bubble frequency. In the 
same way, bubble properties play key roles in de termining the heat transfer rate in bubble 
columns (Yang et al. , 2000). Furthermore, bubble size distribution and bubble velocity 
distribution are key parameters in evaluating the drag forces on bubbles and in using the 
bubble population balance in Computa tional Fluid Dynamics (CFD). 
 
  2
However, the measurement of bubble size, bubble  velocity, and specif ic interfacial area 
in two and three-phase systems has always been a challenging problem. The problem is 
even much more complex when the system be ing considered is no longer in the bubbly 
flow regime, but rather in th e chaotic churn-turbulent flow regime and at high pressure, 
conditions which are of industrial interest. 
 
The appeal of non-invasive techniques has led to attempts to capture the bubble size 
distribution bubble velocity di stribution by video imaging t echniques (Patel, Daly and 
Buckar, 1990; Idogawa, 1997; Luewisutthichat,  Tsutsumi and Yoshida, 1997a; Mihai and 
Pincovschi, 1998; Marques et al. , 1999). However, video imaging can be used only in 2-
D transparent columns at low gas holdup, where light can penetrate the system. In real 3-
D columns, even with transparent walls, th is technique provides no hope of capturing 
anything beyond the reactor wall. Video imagi ng also cannot be used in systems where 
the columns are operated at high temperature and high pressure and thus cannot be made 
of transparent materials. Thus, invasive techniques are still the state of the art when it 
comes to bubble size and bubble velocity me asurements in practical 3-D multiphase 
systems. 
 
In recent years, optical and conductivity microprobes have been most frequently 
employed to investigate bubble properties (Vince et al. , 1982; Matsuura and Fan, 1984; 
Lee, De Lasa and Bergougnou, 1986; Sa xena, Rao and Saxena, 1990; Chabot et al. , 1992; 
Kuncova, Zahradnik and Mach, 1993; Groen et al. , 1996; Farag et al. , 1997; Luo et al. , 
1998; A. Cartellier, 1998; Mudde and Saito, 2001). Conductivity probes utilize the difference in electrical conductivity between the liquid phase and the gas phase. Optical 
fiber probes make use of the difference in th e refractive index betw een the gas phase and 
the liquid phase and provide a sequence of voltage pulses when a bubble passes by the 
probe. In comparison with conductivity pr obes, optical probes offer significant 
advantages: 1) They can be used in c onductive as well as non-conductive (organic) 
systems, which are important in the petroche mical industry. 2) The presence of a liquid 
film on the sensor tip reduces the effectiveness of a conductivity probe but not that of an  3
optical probe. Therefore the sensitivity of optical probes is higher than that of 
conductivity probes (van der Lans, 1985). 3) Optical probes achieve a much better 
signal/noise ratio than conductivity probes. 
 
At present, optical probes have been used  mainly to determine bubble size and velocity 
for individual bubbles in bubbly flows of  modest gas holdup. There is no firm 
experimental data or theory that can guide us  as to how to use these probes and interpret 
their signals in churn-turbulent flow w ith significant bubble coalescence and re-
dispersion and with a wide di stribution of bubble sizes. The goal of this work is to 
explore what bubble phase information can be  obtained in churn-tu rbulent flows using 
optical probe and make necessary modifica tions to the data processing algorithm. 
 
For many years now, Washington Univers ity’s Chemical Reaction Engineering 
Laboratory (CREL) has used  Computer Tomography (CT) and Computer Automated 
Radioactive Particle Tracking (CARPT) to investig ate the gas holdup di stribution and the 
liquid phase recirculation in bubble columns. The gas holdup obtained by the optical 
probe in the current study can be compared with values al ready obtained by CT for 
validation. Moreover, gas holdup is qualitatively determined by the bubble velocity and 
the bubble size distribution. Hence, by investigating these bubble properties, the mechanism for changes in the gas holdup prof iles with changing operating conditions can 
be disclosed. Furthermore, in bubble column s the liquid recirculation derives from and 
interacts with bubble properties. Hence, the combination of the measurement results from 
CARPT with bubble properties obtained by the pr obe can give a cleare r understanding of 
the hydrodynamics in bubble columns. 
 
In CFD, the population balance model, applie d to gas bubbles, is needed to provide a 
statistical formulation to de scribe the gas phase in bubbl e columns. The bubble size and 
velocity distribution functions are employed in the population balance model. So far, 
either a ‘mean’ bubble size is assumed or th e bubble size distribution is predicted from 
the bubble breakup and coalescence model. This can be much improved by comparing  4
the experimental results for the bubble velo city and size distribut ion obtained by the 
probe with the predictions generated by the model. Furthermore, two-fluid model based 
codes (e.g., FLUENT, CFX, CFDLIB) cannot predict well the observed gas holdup radial 
profiles, even in 3D simulations. With the bubble velocity and size distribution obtained 
by the probe, the prediction of the gas hol dup profile in CFD can be improved, which 
would substantially increase the capability of CFD modeli ng of bubble column reactors. 
This improvement, however, is beyond the scope of this thesis. 
 
1.2  Research Objectives 
 
The overall objective of this work is to investigate the bubble velocity distribution, 
bubble chord length distribution, local gas hol dup, and specific interfacial area as a 
function of operating conditions (i.e., superficial gas velocity, pressure etc.) in both bubbly flow and in churn-turbulent flow in bubble columns. Four major research goals 
are: 
 
(1) Modify the data processing algorithm to  improve the capability of the four-point 
optical probe to set up a practical tool for investigating bubble properties in bubble 
columns in both bubbly flow and churn-turbulent flow. 
 
(2) Validate the four-point optical probe and the developed novel data processing 
algorithm versus video imaging in validation setups, e.g., a 2-D bubble column, at 
different conditions. 
 
(3) Use this probe in a 6.4” bubble columns to study the bubble velocity distribution, 
bubble chord length distribution, gas holdup, and the specific interfacial area at 
superficial gas velocity up to  60 cm/s, pressure up to 1.0 MP a, and for different spargers. 
These operating conditions are the same as those at which the CT and CARPT 
experiments were carried out in CREL (Bong Cheng Ong, 2003). These data are 
nonexistent in the literature.  5
 
(4) Obtain deeper understandi ng of the hydrodynamics of bubble columns by analyzing 
such data.  6
 
Chapter 2  Background 
 
2.1  Bubbles’ Behavior in (Slurry) Bubble Columns 
 
The research presented in the literature has captured some aspects of the behavior of 
bubbles in bubble columns and slurry bubble columns. The following are the results 
pertinent to this study. 
 
2.1.1  Bubble Shape, Motion, and Size Distribution 
 
Bubbles in motion are generally classified by shape as spheri cal, oblate ellipsoidal, and 
spherical/ellipsoidal cap, etc. (Figure 2- 1). The actual bubble sh ape depends on the 
relative magnitudes of the forces  acting on the bubble, such as  surface tension and inertial 
forces (Bhaga and Weber, 1981). When the bubble size is small (for example, volume 
equivalent bubble diameter d e<1mm in water), the surface tension force predominates 
and the bubble is approximately spherical. 
 
For bubbles of intermediate size, the effects of both surface tension and the inertia of the 
medium flowing around the bubble  are important. As a result,  intermediate-size bubbles 
exhibit very complex shapes and motion char acteristics. While called ellipsoidal bubbles, 
they often lack fore-and-aft symmetry a nd, in extreme circumstances, cannot be 
described by any simple regular geometry, due to significant shape fluctuations (Bhaga 
and Weber, 1981). This complex shape results from the superposition of various modes 
of fluctuations that are of different amplitudes and take place at different frequencies 
(Hibino, 1969). The dominant mo de of shape fluctuations ha s been noted to be quite 
periodic and characterized by the extension/cont raction of the bubble he ight/width or vice 
versa, i.e., variation in the bubble as pect ratio (Bhaga and Weber, 1981). 
 7  
Large bubbles, whose volum es are larger than 3 cm3 (i.e., d e>18mm ) in general, are 
dominated by inertial or buoyancy forces, with  negligib le effects of surface tension an d 
viscosity of  the liquid m edia. The bubble is  approxim ately a sphe rical cap with an 
included angle of about 100o (provided liquid viscosity µl<50 m Pa⋅s) and a relatively flat 
or som etimes indented base. The fluctuati on in the overall shape becom es suppressed, 
i.e., the m ain feature of  the bubble’s shape fluctuation is the os cillation of the bubble  
base, especially in the edge region (Bhaga and Weber, 1981). 
 
 
Figure 2-1.  Sketches of Various B ubble Shapes Observed in Infinite 
Newtonian Liquid (Bhaga and Weber, 1981) 
 
In m ultiphase flow system s, bubble size distri bution is not constant but changes due to 
breakup and/or coalescence of bubbles cause d by bubble-bubble interactions (Dom enico 
et al. , 1999). The rates of these two processes are associated with the generated bubble 
size and the property of surrounding liquid. In  a coalescence-prom oting liquid, such as 
water and pure organic liquids, bubbles generated are apt to coalesce, so that the bubble 
size in the fully developed flow region is la rger than the initia l bubble size generated  8
from the sparger. When a coalescence hinderi ng liquid, such as electrolytes and alcohols, 
are added to an aqueous solution, the initial bubbles generated at the sparger essentially 
do not change in size in the course of rising to the free surface. Accordingly, higher gas 
holdup and specific interfacial area than those encountered  in a coalescence-promoting 
liquid can be achieved in a coalescence hindering liquid (Hikita et al., 1980; Heijnen and 
van’t Riet, 1984). It has been reported that whatever the liquid phase, in multiphase flow 
systems the bubble size distributi ons are very asymme tric and can be represented well by 
the log-normal distribution (Luewisutth ichat, Tsutsumi and Yoshida, 1997a; 
Rajarathinam and Nafis, 1996; Chanson, 1997). 
 
No broadly applicable model for the determination of rate s of coalescence and breakup 
has yet been presented, due to both the inaccurate understanding of the physical 
mechanisms that lead to bubbl e breakup and coalescence, and the enormous difficulty in 
obtaining reliable data, especially at high gas flow rates. The latter is the reason why 
bubble size distribution measur ements are not so common in  literature, and, often, 
different techniques lead to different meas ured values. Actually, bubble size in bubble 
columns, including 2D bubble columns, cannot be measured directly, i.e., without any 
assumptions on bubble shape, by any available t echnique so far, except at some extreme 
conditions, e.g., single bubble rise or a extrem ely thin 2D bubble column (Spicka et al., 
1999). Methods now available to derive  the bubble size distribution include: 
 
(1) Video imaging (Bhaga and Weber, 1981; Do menico et al., 1999; Spicka et al., 1999). 
 
(2) Point probes (Burgess and Calderbank, 1975; Manabu et  al., 1995; Wu and Ishii, 
1999; Sanaullah, Zaidi and Hills, 2001; Vince et  al., 1982; Yu and Kim, 1988; Chabot et 
al., 1992; Farag et al., 1997; Mudde and Saito, 2001; Xue et al., 2003). 
 
(3) Dynamic gas disengagement technique (Krishna, Wilkinson and van Dierendonck, 
1991; Daly, Patel and Bucker, 1992; Deshpande, Dinkar and Joshi, 1995). 
   9
The bubble size distribution obtained by the dy namic gas disengagement method is not 
reliable, due to unrealistic assumptions and too many approximations, e.g., the bubble 
size is obtained from the correla tion of bubble size and the termin al rise velocity in a still 
medium and the bubble rise ve locities were calculated ve ry roughly (Daly, Patel and 
Bukur, 1992). 
 
Video imaging has been frequently employed to study the behavior of bubbles in bubble 
columns and other gas-liquid contactors. Howe ver, it can be used only in transparent 
systems, e.g., 2D systems and 3D systems w ith very low gas holdup. At high gas holdup, 
video imaging can investigate only the near wall section. Furthermore, to employ video 
imaging, the wall of the multiphase systems i nvestigated must be made of transparent 
material, i.e., glass or Plexiglas, which hinde rs its application to high pressure systems. 
Hence, video imaging is not suitable for pr actical systems, which are usually 3D, with 
high gas holdup and opaque walls. 
 
Various point probes can be us ed in opaque systems. They can be employed at high gas 
holdup and in high pressure systems. Howeve r, the model assumed for the bubble shape 
is an important factor affecting the accuracy  of the measurement results for the bubble 
size distribution. In general the measuremen t by point probes requires the transformation 
of bubble chord length distribution, obtai ned by probes, to bubbl e size distribution. 
Usually, simple symmetric geometric models are employed to represent bubbles’ shapes. 
The following axially symmetric geometric shape models were customarily used as 
approximations of real bubbles: 
 
(1) In the case of small bubb les, bubbles are modeled as  spheres (Batchelor, 1967; 
Harmathy, 1960). 
 
(2) Large bubbles (e.g., over 1.5mm diameter in  air-water systems) are represented as 
ellipsoids with a larger horizontal than ve rtical dimension (Harmathy, 1960; Clark and 
Turton, 1988).  10
 
(3) Very large bubbles, with strong wakes in liquids, are cap-shaped (Hills and Darton, 
1975; Batchelor, 1967), and can be modeled as th e top lesser section of an ellipsoid or 
sphere (refer to Figure 2-1). 
 
(4) In fluidized beds, the bubble shape is often termed “spherical cap” (Reuter, 1966; 
Rowe and Widler, 1973), and is modeled by the top greater section of a sphere or 
ellipsoid. 
 
The shape of splitting and coalescing bubbles is  very complicated. Data interpretation in 
such circumstances is very difficult, for the shape is not well defined. Furthermore, in 
many situations, e.g., in churn-turbulent flow, due to the bubble shape fluctuation 
mentioned above, the shape of many bubbles is  highly irregular and is not constant, so 
that it cannot be represented by any simple geometric model at all. 
 
In gas-liquid upflow, bubbles move faster than the surrounding liqui d (due to buoyancy), 
and large bubbles rise more quickly than small bubbles. The motion of bubbles is very 
complex. The rise path and change in orient ation of the bubble are known to be strongly 
related to the bubble shape (Fan and Tsuchiya, 1990). The motion of spherical bubbles is 
usually rectilinear. On ce the bubble becomes deformed into  an oblate ellips oid, instability 
sets in, and results in a spiral or zigzag tr ajectory. Luewisutthichat, Tsutsumi and Yoshida 
(1997b) found that both the bubble shape an d bubble velocity of oblate ellipsoidal 
bubbles exhibit chaotic features . In turn, the fluctuation of the bubble shape is likely to 
cause oscillation of the drag force, leading to  the chaotic fluctuation of bubble velocity in 
the streamwise direction. Therefore, in sp ite of the periodic m acroscopic motion, bubbles 
exhibit highly chaotic fluctuations in both the lateral and axial components along the zigzag path of the bubble ascent. At the sa me time, the bubble orientation changes in 
such a way that the bubble major axis tends to be perpendicular to the direction of 
instantaneous motion (Haberman and Morton, 1953). 
 11  
As the bubb le size increases furth er, the bubb le changes fro m an ellipso idal to sph erical-
cap shape,  the rad ius of  the sp iral or the am plitud e of the zigz ag path  grad ually d ecreases 
as bubble size increases, and the motion eventua lly becom es rectilinear style, but with a 
oscillating com ponent. This rule is genera lly valid in system s of low Morton number, 
34gMoρσµ= , where g is  the acceleration of gravity, ρ, σ and µ are the density, surface 
tension and viscosity of the liquid. 
 
2.1.2   Gas Liquid Flow  Patterns a nd Flow  Regimes (Hydrodynamics) 
 
Two different types of flow regim es are ge nerally encountered in bubble colum n 
operation, nam ely, bubbly flow a nd churn-turbulent flow. Bubbl y flow transits to churn-
turbulent flow as the gas supe rficial velocity incr eases above a critical value. Chen, R eese 
and Fan (1994) studied m acroscopic flow st ructures in 3-D bubble columns, at various 
operating co nditions in an air-water s ystem  at atmospheric pressure, using Particle Im age 
Velocim etry (PIV). They described three di fferent flow regim es: the dispersed bubble, 
vortical-spiral flow, and turbulen t flow regim es (Figure 2-2). 
 
 
Figure 2-2.  Flow  Regimes in a 3-D Bubbl e Column (Chen, Reese and Fan, 1994 ) 
 12  
At low gas velocities, b ubble stream s are obser ved to rise rectilin early with relatively 
uniform size distribution along the colum n radius. Bubble coalescence and breakup are 
insignificant in this dispersed bubble regim e. 
 
With a further increase in s uperficial gas velocity, bubbles start form ing a central bubble 
stream , which m oves in an oscillating spir al m anner. Bubble coalescence and breakup 
becom e evident as the gas velocity reaches a certain value (about 2.1 cm /s in an air-w ater 
system , according to Chen, Reese and Fan, 1994). In  the m eantim e, the rotating  
frequency of the central bubble stream is intens ified as the gas veloci ty increases, which 
results in  a m ore clearly observ able spiral motion of the central bu bble stream . The 
central bubble stream , which consists of coalesced bubbles and bubble clusters, not only 
spirals upward but also swings laterally ba ck and  forth. In  the region  betw een the  central 
bubble stream and the c olumn wall, tiny bubbles are observed to m ove up and down. This  
phenom enon indicates the dynam ic nature of this region. The general macroscopic flow 
structure of a 3-D column in the vortical-spira l flow regim e is displayed in Figure 2-3. 
 
 
Figure 2-3.  Flow  Struc ture in th e Vortical-Spiral Flow  Regime 
in a 3-D Gas-Liquid Bubble Column (Chen, Re ese and Fan, 1994)  13
 
For still higher gas velocity ranges ( 4.2~4.9 cm/s, Chen, Reese and Fan, 1994), large 
bubbles start forming by intensive bubble coalesce nce, and moving in a sort of “discrete” 
manner, i.e., discrete large bubbles are separa ted by a certain distan ce. The spiral flow 
pattern of the central bubble stream gradually breaks down. 
 
Krishna, Wilkinson and van Dierendonck (1 991) inferred from gas disengagement 
experiments that there are both large and sm all bubbles in churn-tu rbulent flow; large 
bubbles constitute the so-called “dilute” phase, and rise rapidly through the core of the 
column, which causes the radial gas holdup pr ofile to be almost parabolic. This non-
uniform gas holdup profile drives liquid circula tion, i.e., the liquid rises in the center and 
falls by the wall. The smaller bubbles form the “dense” phase and closely follow the liquid, thereby undergoing recirc ulation with the liquid. Larg e bubbles rise fast through 
the column virtually in plug flow, while sm all bubbles display a wide residence time 
distribution. Beyond a certain transition gas velocity, the small bubble holdup remains 
constant, while the large bubble holdup keeps in creasing with the gas velocity.  Such a 
‘bimodal’ bubble size distribution is reported by Krishna, Wilkinson and van 
Dierendonck (1991) as a characte ristic feature of the churn-turbulent flow regime.  
 
However, Deshpande, Dinkar and Joshi (1995) provided another explanation for the gas 
disengagement experimental results. Th ey thought that the initial faster gas 
disengagement is partly due to  internal liquid recirculation instead of due to only the 
presence of very large bubbles, and, hen ce, claimed that the bimodal bubble size 
distribution is not necessar ily proven by results of gas disengagement experiments. 
 
As mentioned before, the video imaging method is limited to 2D systems and 3D systems 
of very low gas holdup. Fan et al. (1999) found that under high- pressure conditions 
bubble coalescence is suppressed, bubble break up is enhanced, and the distributor tends 
to generate smaller bubbles. All these factor s contribute to small bubble sizes and narrow 
bubble size distributions. However, their observation was conducted in bubble columns  14
of small diameter (2” and 4”) and at low ga s holdup. Hence, there are no visual or video 
observations available for 3D bubble columns,  of larger size a nd operated at high 
superficial gas velocity and hi gh pressure, to clarify the exis tence or lack of the bimodal 
bubble size distribution in churn-turbulent flow. By measuring the bubble chord length 
distribution with a four-point  optical probe in a bubble column of 6.4” diameter and at 
high superficial gas velocity (up to 60 cm/s) and high pressu re (up to 10 ba r) in this 
research, it is expected that this issue can be clarified. 
 
2.1.3  Effect of Operating Conditions on Hydrodynamics 
 
The superficial gas velocity is one of the most important factors that affect the hydrodynamics in bubble columns. As the supe rficial gas velocity increases, the flow 
condition in bubble columns changes from bubbl y flow to churn-turbulent flow; at the 
same time, the liquid recirculation is enhanced; the Sauter mean bubble diameter increases, and the bubble size di stribution becomes wider (Olmos et al. , 2001). The gas 
holdup radial profile is flat in bubbly flow, and it is parabolic in churn-turbulent flow; in 
bubbly flow the gas holdup increases more rapi dly with gas velocity than in churn-
turbulent flow (Chen, Reese and Fan, 1994; Kemoun et al. , 2001; Lin et al. , 2001). 
 
Pressure and temperature affect the beha vior of bubbles mainly by varying physical 
properties of fluids (gas dens ity, liquid viscosity, surface te nsion). In detail, gas density 
increases with pressure and decreases with  temperature, the liquid surface tension 
decreases with both pressure and temperature, the liquid viscosity decreases with 
temperature, and the effect of pressure on liquid viscosity is  negligible.                         
It was found that the Sauter mean bubble diameter decreases with an increase in pressure 
or temperature; the rise veloc ity of bubbles decreases  with an increase in pressure and a 
decrease in temperature (Fan et al. , 1999; Lin, Tsuchiya and Fan, 1998). At elevated 
pressure, the transition from bubbly flow to churn-turbulent flow is delayed (Letzel et al. , 
1997). The effect of pressure on gas holdup in the homogeneous regime is insignificant 
(Kolbel et al., 1961; Deckwer et al. , 1980). In churn-turbulent flow, gas holdup increases  15
with pressure, and the radial profile of the gas holdup b ecomes more parabolic (Jiang et 
al., 1995; Fan et al. , 1999; Chen et al. , 1999b). Consequently, the volumetric mass 
transfer coefficient increases also with pressure (Stegeman et al. , 1996). Some 
researchers (Wilkinson and Haringa, 1994; Jiang et al. , 1995; Luo et al., 1998) believe 
that as pressure is increased, the bubble si ze at the distributor  is reduced; bubble 
coalescence is suppressed; and large bubbles tend to break up, so that higher pressure 
(gas density) leads to smaller bubbles, and hence to an increase in gas holdup. However, 
in bubbly flow, this could not be confirmed by studies at  Sandia National Laboratory 
(Shollenberger et al., 1997). Generally an in crease in temperature leads to higher gas 
holdup (Bach and Pilhofer, 1978; Zou et al ., 1988; Wilkinson and van Dierendonck, 
1990). The reasons are: (1) Both the surface te nsion and the liquid viscosity decrease if 
the temperature increases, and lower surface tension and liquid viscosity leads to a higher 
gas holdup. (2) A higher temperature also increases  the vapor pressure of the liquid. If the 
feed gas to a bubble column is not saturated, the evaporation of the liquid phase can lead 
to a substantial increase in the volumetric gas flow rate, which subsequently increases the gas holdup.  
 
It was reported that column diameters larg er than about 15 cm do not affect gas holdup 
much (Chen et al. , 1998). On the other hand, the liquid recirculation in a large diameter 
column is stronger than that in a small diameter column (Joshi et al. , 1998; Chen et al. , 
1998). 
 
The gas distributor also has important effects on bubbles in bubble columns. 
Jamialahmadi and Muller-Steinhagen (1993)  found that in the bubbly flow regime, 
bubble size was a strong function of the orific e diameter and the wettability of the gas 
distributor, and a weak function of superficial gas velocity. In the churn-turbulent flow 
regime, this functionality was reversed, i.e., the effect of the sparger on the gas holdup 
and the liquid velocity profile is weak in  the fully developed flow region in bubble 
columns. Mikkilineni and Knickle (1987) stud ied the effect of various porous-plate gas 
distributors (polyethylene,  polypropylene, SiC, Al 2O3, etc.) on gas holdup and flow  16
pattern in the bubbly flow regime in a bubbl e column. They reported the following: (1) 
Gas holdup increased w ith the pore size and distributor thickness, (2) Hydrophobic 
distributor plates gave higher gas hol dup than the hydrophilic ones because the 
hydrophilic plates promote bubble coalescence, which results  in decreased gas holdup, 
due to different wetting characteristics, and (3) The bubble size was dependent on the 
pore size, gas velocity, and column height  and not on the distributor thickness and 
material. 
 
The situation in slurry bubbl e columns is more complicated. Whether a rising bubble 
behaves as if it were in a “homogeneous” or  “heterogeneous” medium depends primarily 
on the ratio of the particle diameter to bubble di ameter, i.e., the effect of solid particles on 
bubble characteristics is entirely different in different pa rticle size rang es. In case of 
small particles (less than 100 µm as reported by Luewisutthicha t, Tsutsumi and Yoshida, 
1997), no significant difference in bubble size a nd velocity distribution was observed in 
comparison with two-phase systems. A liquid-so lid mixture of small, light particles is 
often regarded as a pseudo-homogeneous medi um. On the other hand, in large particle 
systems (larger than 500 µ m), increased bubble coalescen ce and breakup due to the 
presence of large particles take place, resulting in a broa der bubble size distribution with 
larger Sauter mean diameter, causing a drop  in gas holdup (Darton and Harrison, 1974; 
Lee, Soria and De Lasa, 1990; Luewisutthichat, Tsutsumi and Yoshida, 1997). 
 
2.1.4  Specific Interfacial Area 
 
Gas-liquid mass transfer in multiphase reacto rs, e.g., bubble columns, is most frequently 
characterized by the overall volumetric mass transfer coefficient k La. The specific 
interfacial area, a, varies significantly w ith the hydrodynamic conditions in reactors. For 
the commonly used local two fluid models in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), 
prediction of the interfacial area is one of the major weaknesses. Thus, experimental data 
for the distribution of interfacial area in the entire reactor are of gr eat interest for the 
validation of two fluid models, and for locat ing zones of low mass transfer in real 17  
reacto rs (Kiam bi et al., 2001). Furth ermore, the specific in terfacial area is one of the key 
param eters that determ ine the heat a nd m ass transf er in m ultiphase sys tems. Hence, it is 
crucial for the design, simulation, and scaleup of bubble columns. 
 
Various physical and chem ical methods have  been applied to m easure the specific 
interf acial area in m ultiphase f lows. 
 
The physical m ethods i nclude gas disengage ment (Patel, Daly and Bukur, 1990), video 
imaging (Akita and Yoshida, 1974; Luewisutth ichat, Tsutsum i and Yos hida, 1997; Lage 
and Esposito, 1999; Pohorecki, Moniuk an d Zdrojkowski, 1999), Laser Doppler 
Anemometry (LDA) (Kulkarni et al., 2001), and probes (Kiam bi et al., 2001; W u and 
Ishii, 1999). In all the physical m ethods except video im aging and som e probes, the 
specific interfacial area for un it of the bubble colum n volum e, a, is determ ined from  the 
gas holdup and bubble size distribu tion. The gas-liquid interfacial  area can be related to 
the gas holdup, εg, and the Sauter mean diam eter (the volume-surface mean diam eter of 
bubbles), d s, by: 
 
sg
d6aε=           ( 2-1) 
 
The Sauter m ean diam eter is calculated by: 
 
∑∑

where d b,i is the volum e-equivalent diam eter of th e mid-sized bubbles w ithin the i-th  size-
class, and n i is the num ber of bubbles with size d b,i. 
 18  
Equation (2-1) is based on the assumption of spherical bubbles, which is not true for most 
practical m ultiphase sy stem s. He nce, Equation (2-1) is an ove rsimplification f or prac tical 
multiphase system s. Besides, as m entioned before, the volum e-equivalent bubble 
diam eter is very difficult to m easure  accura tely in m ultiphase system s. Hence, Equatio n 
(2-1) can be treated only as a rough es timate of specific interfacial area. 
 
Kataoka, Ishii and Serizawa (1986) derived the equation for the specific interfacial area, 
a, in gas-liquid  system s as: 
 
∑φ⋅⋅∆=
φ⋅⋅∆=

where N is the total nu mber of the gas-liqui d interfaces  passing by  the probe du ring the 
measurem ent tim e ∆T, and φ is the angle between the velocity vector and the norm al 
vector of the gas-liqu id interface (b ubble’s surface). Equation (2-3) pro vides the probe 
technique w ith the capab ility to m easure spec ific interf acial area dire ctly. 
 
The chem ical m ethods (Stegem an et al., 1996;  Vazquez et al., 2000; Kulkarni et al., 
2001) are based on the study of reactions of known kinetics in which the absorption rate 
is a function  of the inte rfacial area. The gas- liquid reaction  system s are s elected in  such a 
way that the absorp tion is accom panied by fast chem ical reaction. As a result, the ov erall 
rate of absorption  (Ra ) is propo rtional to the inte rfacial area,  and is giv en by  the 
following equation (Danckwerts, 1970):

where [ A*] is the satura tion concentr ation of  solute gas (A) in  the liquid p hase, [ B0] is the

reaction system s with known F are then used  in bubble colu mns, where the m easurem ent 
of Ra directly gives a  ( F/Raa= ). 
 
The chem ical m ethods have several shortcom ings: (1) They can de rive only the overall 
value of  interfacial area rath er th an the distribution of specific interfacial area in  
multiphase system s. (2) The additio n of chem icals to  condu ct the chem ical reaction m ay

And (3) they  are inconv enient to u se, due to the c omplexity o f the princip le. 
 
The value o f ‘a’ is expected to d epend upon co lumn diam eter, D, axial position,  z, radial

Hibiki and Ishii (2002) also derived a sem i-theoretical co rrelation from the interfacial

In Equation  (2-6), ∆ρ is the density difference between phases, and α is the en ergy

flow with different liquid phases. Hibiki a nd Ishii (2002) obtained an agreem ent between 
the developed sem i-theoretical correlation and 459 data points, within an average r elative 
deviation of ±22.0%. 
 
With an increase in pres sure, the spe cific interfacial area increases, due to an increas e in 
gas holdup and decrease in bubbl e size. However, m easurem ents of specific interf acial 
area at high  pressu re are m uch more com plicated than tho se at atm ospheric p ressure. 
Wilkinson, Spek and van Dierendonck (1992) de veloped experim entally the relationship

bubbly flow:

Equation (2-7) gives a way to estimate the sp ecific interfaci al area for high pressure on 
the basis of atm ospheric data. However, the accuracy of the prediction of Equation (2-7) 
has not been validated.  
 
An extensiv e lite rature survey was perf ormed by Hibiki an d Ishii (200 2) for existing 
interfacial area values m easur ed by various methods in fo rced convective bubbly flows  
and bubble colum ns. Key entries are shown in Table 2-1. It should be noted that the   21
experimental results obtained by different researchers and different methods varied 
considerably, and the difference among the va lues of the Sauter mean bubble diameter 
(and specific interfacial area) estimated by va rious empirical equations can easily be as 
much as a factor of two for apparently equal conditions. 
 
In short, measurements of the specific interf acial area in multiphase systems are difficult, 
especially beyond very low gas holdup and in practical systems. As mentioned before, 
the methods employed so far either have se rious limitations or are complicated, and the 
results obtained are not reliable. Table 2-1.  Existing Data Sets for Specific Interfacial Area Taken in Bubble Columns (Hib iki and Ishii, 2002)

2.2  Type of Probes Used in Multiphase Systems 
 
In recent years, measurements of bubble be havior have usually been carried out by 
various types of probes (Burge ss and Calderbank, 1975; Manabu et al. , 1995; Wu and 
Ishii, 1999; Sanaullah, Zaidi and Hills, 2001; Vince et al. , 1982; Yu and Kim, 1988; 
Chabot et al. , 1992; Farag et al. , 1997; Mudde and Saito, 2001) . The miniaturization of 
probes using fiber optics or small electr odes makes them good choices for performing 
direct measurements of the bubble velocity  and bubble chord length, even at high gas 
flow rates or in opaque systems. A comp arison of measurement methods based on 
miniature optical and conductiv ity probes was presented by  Choi and Lee (1990). In 
comparison with conductivity probes, optical probes offer several a dvantages: (1) They 
can be used in conductive as well as non- conductive (organic) systems, which are 
important in the petrochemical industry. (2) The presence of a liquid film on the sensor 
tip reduces the effectiveness of a conductivity probe but not that of an optical probe, The 
sensitivity of optical probes is therefore hi gher than that of conductivity probes (van der 
Lans, 1985). (3) The optical probe achieves a much better signal/noise ratio than a 
conductivity probe. 
 
To measure the bubble velocity, at least two pr obes (tips or measure points) are needed. 
The two probes (or tips, measur e points) are placed in the m acroscopic flow direction at a 
small distance apart (e.g., 2~ 3 mm). The bubble velocity is calculated by dividing the 
distance between these two probes by the time interval that the bubble takes to pass 
through the distance between them. The two- point probes used by various researchers 
have different configurati ons, as shown in Figure 2-4. 26  
 
Figure 2-4.  Various Tip Configurations of  Two-point Pr obes (Choi and Lee, 1990) 
 
A two-point conductivity probe used by W u and Ishii (1999) is shown in Figure 2-5. The  
probe consists of two thin electro des. Th e tip of each electrode is exposed to the  
multiphase system . The impedance between th e probe tip and the comm on ground can be 
measured. Owing to th e large d ifference in c onductivity between the liquid phase and gas 
bubbles, the im pedance signal rises sharply wh en a bubble passes through the probe. It 
was reported that because the diam eter of the probe tips is very sm all (89 µm in 
diam eter), no significant bubble deform ation or fragm entation was observed through flow 
visualization for the studied bubble size range  between 2 and 4 mm. The  time delay of 
the two im pedance signals, ∆t, wa s utilized to  charac terize the tim e interv al for the 
bubble surface traveling from  the front probe tip to the back  tip. W ith a known separation 
of the two probe tips, ∆s, the bubble velocity was obtained as . The bubble 
chord length pierced by the two tips of the probe can be obtained as , where Tt/s v∆∆=
i i Tv L⋅= i 
is the tim e interval that Tip i spent in the bubble. W ith assumptions on the bubble shape 
(e.g., ellipsoidal bubbles), and by using stat istical algorithm s, the bubble chord length 
distribution can be transferred to bubble size distribution. H owever, this m ethod is error 
sensitive, and the bubble size distri bution obtained is not reliable. 27  
 
Figure 2-5.  Schematic Diagram of a Double-Sensor Conductivity Probe 
(Wu and Ishii, 1999) 
 
In m ultiphase system s bubbles hit the probe tips random ly. To elim inate the uncertainty 
existing in deducing the bubble size and veloc ity distribution due to the varying and 
unknown position s at which the pro be contact s the bubble frontal su rfaces, Burgess and  
Calderbank  (1975) developed a five-point conduc tivity probe (Figure 2-6). The probe 
was designed by symm etrically positioning thre e tips around and above a central tip so 
that these three tip s exist in a horizontal plan e. A fifth t ip was placed in the s ame 
horizontal p lane as the central tip b ut som ewhat  distant from it. By requiring tips 2, 3, 
and 4 to respond alm ost at the sam e time, the probe records only those encounters w here 
the bubble velocity and bubble vertical axis are co incident with the probe axis within fine  
limits. The response of the fifth tip was used to determ ine the horizontal dim ension of the 
bubble, with the assum ption th at bubbles are ellipsoidal. 28

(Burgess and Calderbank, 1975) 
(The probe dimensions: d p=4.43 mm, r p=2.4 mm, and x p=7.02 mm) 
 
In contrast, a two-point probe cannot pr ovide m uch inform ation on bubbles’ shape. 
Hence, Iguchi, Nakatan i and Kawabata (1997) developed  a m ultineed le conductivity 
probe (Figure 2-7) to detect  the profile of bub bles rising in m olten metal baths. An 
exam ple of the bubble profile detected is al so shown in Figure 2- 7. The bubble velocity 
was determ ined by the central needle of the pr obe, which is actually a tw o-point probe. 
 29  
      
  
 
Figure 2-7.  Schematic of the Multineedle Conductivity Probe 
and the Bubble Shape Detected (Igu chi, Nakatani and Kaw abata, 1997) 
 
Optical probes used by researchers have the sam e configuration as the conductivity 
probes show n above, except that the tips in the probe are m ade of optical fibers instead of 
conductors. Optical probes can be classified according to their operating principle into 
light transm ission probes a nd light reflection probes. 
 
A light tr ansmission probe dete cts the ligh t transmitted acros s the  light path, while a  light 
reflection probe detects the light reflected at the probe tip or in the phase around the 
probe tip. Light reflection probes have been more frequently em ployed because they are 
smaller and more accurate. 
 
An exa mple of light transm ission probes can  be found in the research of Kuncova, 
Zahradnik and Mach (1993). The probe assem bly they used consisted of two separate 
probes (Figure 2-8). A decrease in  light transm ission at the ga p between the two ends of a  
fiber, caused by a passing bubble, was e mployed as its signal. The gas holdup can be  
obtained as  the ratio of light ab sorbance (500nm ) in gas-liqui d bed and in air, 30  
respectively,  because the absorbance is proporti onal to the retention of air in the pro be 
space. An average vertical dim ension of bubbl es, d v, was calculated f rom the local gas 
holdup εg, the bubble frequency f, and the bubble velocity v (in this study, v was 
calculated as v = superficial gas veloci ty/overall gas holdup, obviously this is an 
oversim plification that causes large  error ): f/v dg v⋅ε= . It should be pointed out that 
this equation is a poor approxim ation to the real value of bubble size. 
 
 
Figure 2-8.  A Light Transmittance Pr obe (Kuncova, Z ahradnik an d Mach, 1993) 
 
Kreischer, Moritom i and Fan (1990) used a li ght transm ission probe with a configuration 
shown in Figure 2-9. Probes w ith this conf iguration can  measure the bubble velocity by  
dividing the distance between the two pairs of probes by the time interva l that the  bubble 
takes to pass through the distance between them. The vertical bubble size (chord length) 
can be obtained by the product of the bubble ve locity and the tim e spent by the bubble to 
pass through one probe. The gas holdup is calcul ated as the ratio of the tim e taken by 
bubbles to pass through the probe gap and the whole experim ental tim e. 
 31  
 
Figure 2-9.  A Light Transmittance Prob e (Kreischer, Moritomi and Fan, 1990) 
 
The m ain lim itation of  all light tra nsmission probes is their large size. The probes in 
Figures 2-8 and 2-9 m easure up to several cen timeters. These big pr obes are inconvenient 
to use in sm all size co lumns, and woul d disturb the flow pattern seriously. 
 
The light reflection probes that have been  employed by researchers for the bubble size 
distribution and bubble rise velo city m easure ments are of di fferent configurations. Some  
light reflection probes detect the light refl ected from  the phase around the probe tip. 
Farag et al.  (1997) used a reflective fiber optic sens or (Figure 2-10) to investigate fluid 
dynam ic properties in turbulent fluidized beds.  The sensor consists of two probes 3.2mm 
apart. Each  probe is form ed with an em itter fiber and two adjacent receiving fibers  
approxim ately 2mm apart from  the em itting fibe r. No light is detected  as long as the 
probe is im mersed in the dense em ulsion phase. In case of a bubble passing by the probe, 
the light is reflected from the wall of the bubbl e to the receiver fibers. They found that 
this fiber optic probe underest imated the bubble f raction, prob ably due to th e existence of 
small undetected or partially detected bubbles. 32  
 
Figure 2-10.  A Reflective Fiber Op tic Sensor (Farag et al. , 1997) 
 
Other light reflection probes detect the light reflected at the probe tip. Accordin g to 
Snell’s Law,  at the interface of two hom ogene ous, isotrop ic media of different ind exes of 
refraction, the following equation holds: )isin(n)isin(n0 0⋅=⋅ , where n and n 0 are th e 
indexes of refraction of  the fiber and the m edium, respectively, while i and i 0 are the 
angles of incidence and  refraction o f the li ght m easured fr om the norm al to the surface 
(Figure 2-11). Hence, if sin(i 0) ≥ n/n 0 then i ≥ 90o, all the light will be  reflected a t the 
interface. T his is called  total reflection. Th e difference of the refractiv e index between 
liquid, gas, and optical fiber ensu re that the light is sca ttered at the p robe tip when it is in 
the liquid phase and reflected when it is in  the gas (bubble) phase. For exam ple, for a 
glass probe tip with an index of refraction of n 0=1.62, a total probe tip angle of 90o, and 
light rays  parallel to th e axis (i 0=45o) (Figure 2-1 1), the  light rays  will be reflected  back if 
n<1.15, and will be ref racted if  n>1.1 5. By detecting the r eflected light, a p robe oper ating 
on this principle enables the di stinction of the gas and liqui d phases p resent at th e pro be 
tip if  ng<1.15<n l. Light reflection probes us ually consist of optical fibers bent into a U-
shape to  create the tip,  or, altern atively, the ends of the fibers  are cut,  sealed, and fin ished 
into a con ical tip. 
 33  
 
Figure 2-11.  Schematic of the Snell’s Law  (Abuaf et al. , 1978) 
 
It was found that the presence of a liquid film  on the sensor tip reduces the effectiveness 
of a conductivity probe but not that of an optical probe. Hence, the wettability of the 
liquid phase with the glass optical fiber does no t affect the sensitivity o f optical pro bes 
very m uch (Frijlink, 1987). Th is is one of the advantages  of optical fiber probes over 
conductivity probes. As illustrated in Figure 2-12, the light ray ‘a’ experiences total 
reflection at the glass -gas interface,  i.e., sin(i) ≥ ngas/nglass. With a liquid f ilm present, 
refraction to  the liqu id will take p lace, and th e ray will a rrive at the liq uid-gas  interface 
with angle o f incidence i’. In the cas e of fl at par allel surf aces it is e asily shown that the 
condition of total reflec tion is now fulfilled a t the liquid -gas in terface:

It may be sa id tha t the c ritical angle where the  total ref lection happens is  transformed to 
the liqu id-gas interface sim ply by Snell’s law.  With a curved surface, s imilar argu ments 
can be used because th e film  thickness is very s mall com pared to the fib er tip’s radius of 
curvatu re, so that the lo cal region o f surface where the reflection h appens can be treated  
as flat.

The optical fiber probes used by Abuaf, Jones and Zi mmer (1978) and Vince et al. (1982) 
to determ ine the local void fr action in bubble colum ns had tips  that were term inated as a 
cone with a 90o apex an gle (Figu re 2-13). The p robe in Figure 2-13 consists of two fibers 
(125 µm in diam eter each), which were fused together at the end. The tip of the probe 
containing the fused ends of the fibe rs was ground and polished at a 45o angle to th e axes 
of the fibers, thus form ing an apex angle of 90o.

Yu and Ki m (1988) used a two-point light re flection probe, whose active elem ents were 
made by bending an optical fiber into a U- shape (Figure 2-14), to de termine the gas

Chabot et al. (1992) used a spherical bulb dual opt ical fiber probe (Figure 2-15) for 
bubble characterization in a bubble colum n and a slurry bubble colum n at high 
temperature.  According to their research res ults, no bubble was observed to  be 
significan tly affected by the probe s, in spite of a decreas e in the bubble v elocity tha t was 
important for sm all bubbles (for example, 2 mm diam eter bubbles in oil). This is because 
small bubbles did not have enough inertia to be pierced by the tips of  optical probes, but 
rather grazed the probes’ tip while being slightly deflected.

probe was a successful m iniature of a two-point probe, i.e., it  com bined tw o tips on to one 
single optical fiber. The application of the m onofiber probe in bubbly flow showed that it 
is com parable to a tw o-point probe.

3.1  Analysis of Measurement Errors for Two-Point Probes 
 
As mentioned earlier, probes are the only mean s that can be applied in practical bubble 
columns to study bubble behavior, e.g., bubble velocity and bubble chord length. Two-
point probes have been employed in most of  the reported studies (Choi and Lee, 1990; 
Chabot et al., 1992; Wu and Ishii, 1999; Fan et al., 1999; Magaud et  al., 2001). Lim and 
Agarwal (1992) analyzed the errors in bubbl e velocity and bubble chord length obtained 
by two-point probes, based on the assumption of spherical bubbles. They found that the 
relative error in the bubble velocity obtai ned by two-point probes varied with the 
incidence angle and the position at which the bubble hits the probe. The error can easily 
be over 100% in many cases. Hence, they conc luded that values of both bubble velocity 
and bubble chord length obtained by a two-point probe are theo retically questionable, and 
experimental results reported using these probes must be viewed at best as qualitative. 
However, their analysis is limited to spheri cal bubbles only, and did not consider the 
curvature correction. Since most bubbles  in bubble columns are approximately 
ellipsoidal, the case of ellipsoidal bubbles is  analyzed in this work, and a curvature 
correction is included in the error analysis . It is thus quantit atively shown that 
measurements of bubble velocity and bubble ch ord length by two-point probes can be 
highly inaccurate. To analyze the measuremen t errors of two-point probes, the following 
assumptions are made (refer to Figure 3-1): 
 
(1) The bubble velocity vector  aligns with the bubble orient ation. In other words, the 
bubble has a symmetry plane (e.g., spherical or e llipsoidal bubbles) that is perpendicular 
to the bubble velocity vector. 39  
 
(2) The shape fluctuation and deformation of  the bubble caused by its interaction with the 
probe are neglected. 
 
(3) The bubble velocity vector (m agnitude and direction) does not  change during the 
bubble’s passage past the probe. 
 
With these assum ptions, the tim e inte rval, ∆t, between the tim e when the leading ed ge of 
a bubble hits Tip0, the longer tip of a two-point probe (Figure 3-1a), and the tim e when it 
hits Tip1, the shorter tip of a two-point probe (ref er to Figure 3-1b), is: 
 
vcosLtθ⋅=∆           ( 3-1) 
 
where v is the m agnitude of th e bubble velocity vector, and θ is the angle between  the 
bubble velocity vector and the probe’s  axial direction (F igure 3-1a). 
 
A closer exam ination reveals that Equation (3-1 ) is not accu rate becau se the curvatu re of 
the bubble’s leading edge is neglected. In f act, the effect of curv ature on m easure ments 
by two-point probes was neglected  in m ost of the published studies (Choi and Lee, 1990; 
Chabot et al., 1992; Wu and Ishii, 1999; Fan et al., 1999; Maga ud et al., 2001). This 
simplification strongly suggests an even larger error range for two-point probe 
measure ments. To obtain the velocity of a bubble, the displacem ent of the bubble’s 
centroid, instead of that of the bubble’s leading edge, needs to be known. The centroid of 
an ellipso idal bubble is on the plane for med by  the m ajor axes of the bubble, i.e., p lane 
AB in Figure 3-1a. 40

Hence, Equation (3-1) is adjusted to account for the bubble’s curvature as follows (refer 
to Figure 3-2):

The m agnitude of the vertical com ponent of the bubble velocity vector with an angle θ to 
the vertical direction is then custom arily obtained as (Korekazu et al., 1980; Lim and 
Agarwal, 1992; Choi and Lee, 1990): 
 
θ=−−∆=cosv

However, the real m agnitude of the vertical  component of the bubble velocity vector is 
(Figure 3-1b): 
 
θ⋅= cosv vz           ( 3-4) 
 
The relative error in the bubble vertical velo city com ponent obtaine d by two-point probes 
therefore is: 
 
%100) (tan %100vv'vError2
zz z×θ=×−=       (3-5) 
 
 
 42  
The relative errors predicted by Equation (3-5 ) are shown in Figure 3-3a. The errors are 
always nonnegative, i.e., the m agnitude of th e bubble vertical velo city obtained by two-
point probes is always larger th an the real valu e. The value of the erro r increases with  the 
value of angle θ: it can be as large as 100% at θ = 45o, and it g oes to inf inity at θ = 90o. 
 
Using a typical algorithm for tw o-point probes, the bubble chor d length is obtained by the  
product of the bubble vertical velocity and the ti me interval that the probe tip spends in 
the bubble. Hence, the error in the bubble ve locity is transferred to the bubble chord 
length. The equation to obtain th e chord length pierced by T ip0 is: 
 
θ=⋅θ=⋅=cosL
vL
cosvTv'L0 0
0'
z 0        ( 3-6) 
 
where L 0 is the real chord length pierced by Tip0, and L 0’ is the bubble chord length 
obtained by a two-point  probe. Actually L 0/cosθ represents the length C E in Figure 3-1a, 
while the real chord length pierced by Tip0, L 0, is the length  CD. 
 
Then the relative error in the bubble chord length pierced by Tip0 is: 
 
%100)1cos1( %100LL'LError
00 0×−θ=×−=       (3-7) 
 
As shown i n Figure 3-3 b, this erro r is also  always positive, i.e., the bubble chord length  
obtained by two-point probes is always larger than the real chord length pierced by the 
probe tip. The error increases with the value of angle θ, and it can be as great as 40 % at θ 
= 45o. 
 
The above analysis indicates that m easur ements of bubble velocity and bubble chord 
length by tw o-point prob es are subject to larg e errors. Reason ably accurate m easurements  
are possible only for very  small value of angle θ, i.e., for small departures of the bubble 43  
velocity vector from  the probe’s axial direct ion (usually vertical direction). Hence, two-
point probes can be used only in the situati ons where all bubbles m ove strictly in one 
direction, su ch as in forced cocurrent gas liquid flow in pipes, and are not suitable for  
system s having com plex hydrodynam ics, such as bubble colum ns. New probes and 
algorithm s need to be designed to obtain th ese im portant param eters in bubble column 
flows. 
 
It can be s een from  Figure 3-3 that when θ = 0o, i.e., when the bubble velocity vector is 
aligned with the probe’s axial direction, the re lative errors in the bub ble ve locity  and 
bubble chord length m easurem ents by two point probes are zero. Hence, the four-point 
probe was originally developed to rem ove the erro rs in m easurem ents by two-p oint 
probes by distinguishing and m easuring only  bubbles that m ove in  the probe’s axial 
direction, as explained in Section 3.2.

3.2 The Configuration and Principle of the Four-Point Optical Prob e 
 
3.2.1  The Configuration of the Four-Point Optical Prob e 
 
Four-point glass optical probe s, developed by F rijlink (198 7) and his colleagues at the 
University o f Delf t in the Netherlan ds, are used  in this resea rch. The optical fiber used is  
FP-200-UHT m ultimode fiber optic produced by 3M  Cor poration. It consists of three 
layers : a qu artz glass core, a silico n cla dding, and a protective layer of Teflon ( core 
diam eter 200±5µm, clad diam eter 380±20µm, outside d iameter 600±30µm). 
 
The configuration of the four-point probe is  shown in Figure 3-4. At one end of the  
optical fibers, the cladding and Teflon layer are removed, and the tip of the glass core is 
shaped into a cone or  semi-sphere, like that show n in Figure 3-4e, with  a hydrogen flam e. 
This shape assures that, according to  the Snell’ s Law (refer to Section 2.2), m ost light is  
reflected at the fiber tip  when the probe is  in gas phase, due to the difference in the 45  
refractive in dex between  the glass, the liquid phase and the gas phase. T hree of the four 
tips of  the probe ar e of the sam e length and  form an equilate ral tr iangle. The f ourth, 
central tip is positioned through the inertial cen ter of this triangle, and is about 2.0 mm 
longer than the others. The radial distance from  the central fiber to each  of the others that 
surround it is about 0.6 mm. Hence, the diam eter of the four-point pr obe is about 1.2 mm.

that the glue does not contact the glass core of th e fiber (o r else the probe m ay not work

the glass fiber is very fragile, one needs to be very careful with this operation.

The f our optica l fibers of  the probe are f itted into a stainle ss steel tube  of 3.0m m outer  
diam eter. The tube is b ent at  the end at an an gle of 90o (Figure 3-6). The end of the 
tubing where the probe tip protrudes is sealed b y epoxy glue. The probe is fitted to  the 
measuring ports on  the column wall with an a ppropriate connector. The horizontal part of 
the tubing is long enough to ensure that it can be traver sed over the column diam eter so 
that the radial profile of bubble properties can  be obtained. The probe  is usually aligned 
vertically, and the tip faces downwards (Figu re 3-6). The fo ur-poin t optical prob e made 
in this configuration can be used at high pressu res and at tem peratu res up  to that th e glass 
fiber and the glue used can stand (up to 500°C). The whole assem bly can be used in 
water, e lectrolytic solu tions, and org anic sys tems. These m edia and operating conditions 
cover m ost applications of the m ultiphase system s employed in industry. 
 
The optical fiber probe is connected to an electronic unit developed by Kram ers 
Laboratory at the U niversity of  Delft. This  electronic unit generates laser beam s, sends 
them  into th e optical f ibers of  the probe, and receives  and transform s the ligh t signals 
reflected fro m the prob e tip into v oltage, using photoelec tric m ultipliers. The voltage 
signals  are sent to  the D ata Acquisition Board (PowerDAQ PD2- MFS-8-1M/12) in the 
computer to be saved  as data files. T o assu re the accuracy  of m easurem ents, the s ampling 
frequency employed is usually 40 kHz, a valu e which had proved successful in the work 
of Frijilink (1987).

3.2.2  Working Principle of the Fou r-Point Op tical Probe 
 
A laser beam (680nm wavelength) from a Li ght Em itting Diode (LED) is sent into th e 
end of  the o ptical fibers,  and then tra nsmitted alo ng the f ibers into th e tips . If the tip of  an 
optica l fiber is in the liq uid phase  (water in th is rese arch), most of the light w ill en ter th e 
liquid phas e, due to the relatively s mall diff erence in the r efractive in dex betw een the 
fiber m aterial (silica gla ss) and the liquid phase. If, on the other hand, the tip of an optical 
fiber is in a bubble, m ost of the light will be reflected back into the fiber at the tip, as  
detailed in S ection 2.2. 
 
A Y-shape splitter, shown in Figure 3-7, is us ed to separate the reflected light from the 
incom ing light. The reflected light signals  are converted to voltage signals by 
photoelectric m ultipliers . 
 
 49  
 
Figure 3-7.  The Schemati c of the Light Splitter 
 
The voltage output is high when the probe tip is in the gas (bubble) phase, and is low  
when it is in the liquid phase. The response of the four-point optical probe, as illustrated 
in Figure 3-8, consists of four  time series for the four ti ps of the probe’s four optical 
fibers. As can be seen from  Figure 3-8, when a bubble hits a fiber tip, the output voltage  
of that fiber rises from  the baseline (liquid phase response) as m ore and m ore of the tip 
surface enters the bubb le and reflects light. W hen the tip is com pletely in side the bub ble 
the output is constant. As shown in Figure 3-8,  this response increase is very fast. When 
the tip finally touches th e bubble-water surf ace at the bottom  of the bub ble, th e output 
voltage de creases to the baselin e. This decrease is even m uch faster than  the increas e in 
the outpu t voltage during the p robe’s init ial p iercing of a bubble b ecause th e surface 
tension will cause the bubble bottom  to move upwards quickly along the fiber. 
 
If a bubble traveling upwards hits the four-point  probe, the central fiber, Tip0, which is a 
little longer than the others, responds first, and the other th ree tips (tips 1,2,3) respond a 
little later. For an axially  symm etric bubble, e.g., an ellipso idal bubble, requiring th at the 
responses of  tips 1, 2, 3 be alm ost simultane ous assures that: (1) the bubble m oves in the 
probe’s axial direction, and (2 ) the probe hits the center of the bubble, i. e., the trajectory 
of the central tip through the bubble is along the bubble’s m inor axis (Frijlink, 1987). If 
the bubble is pierced too m uch on the side, or  the bubble does not m ove in the probe’s 
axial dir ection, the  resp onses of  the three tips  1, 2, 3 will not be simultaneous, due to the  
curvatu re of the bubble surface.

Figure 3-8.  Response of the Four-Poi nt Probe to a Bubble Pierced T hrough 
 
Hence, by a nalyzing the output of the four-poi nt optical fiber probe, one can distinguish 
and reject both bubbles that do not approach the probe in th e probe’s axial direction and 
bubbles that are not pierced by th e probe in the center. In pract ice, a tolerance is set to 
accept bubb les being pierced in th e vicin ity of  the central line.  Hence, the four-point  
probe can m easure the bubble velocity m ore accurately than two-point probes b ecause 
only bubbles m oving in a sm all range of angle θ close to zero, i.e ., bubbles whose m otion 
deviate little from  the probe’s  axial direction,  are m easured . Hence, the theoretical error 
in the bubble velocity and bubble chord length obtained by the f our-point probe is sm all, 
as evid ent from  Figure 3 -3 and th e discussions in Section 3.1. Furthermore, the length of 
the bubble’s m inor axis can be obtained d irectly and m ore accurately by avoiding  the 
transfer of the bubble chord le ngth distribution m easured by the probe to the bubble size 
distribution, as needs to be  done in m easure ments by two- point probes (Liu, Clark and 
Karam avruc, 1996, 1998) which is subject to large error. This is also one of the 
advantages of the four-poi nt optical probe over two- point probes. However, the  
disadvantage of the four-point optical probe, as used in the study of  Frijlink (1987), is 
that in complex flow patterns only  a very small fraction of bubbles will hit the p robe 
centra lly and ris e in the probe ’s axial d irection. Thus, it is uncer tain that the ob tained  
measure ment reflects the bubble pop ulation that is present. T his will be corrected in our 51  
work as shown later. The diam eter of the f our-point probe is 1.2mm . Thus, theoretically 
the four-point probe can m easure only bubbles whose diameter  in the plane perpendicular 
to the probe direction is gr eater than 1.2mm. There is no upper lim it to the bubble size 
that can b e measured by this prob e. 
 
3.2.3  Signal Analysis 
 
The four-point optical probe pr ovides four tim e series for the detected voltage at the tips,

First,  the time series a re transferred  to the binary m ode via an appr opriate thresho ld (th).  
Different threshold is used for the extracti on of bubble velocity, bubb le chord length and 
local gas holdup. The threshold used for the calculation of bubble velocity is 60% of  the 
difference between the baseline voltage a nd the peak value for bubbles. Thus, the 
response points where the output of the probe  increases 60% of the difference between 
the baseline and the peak value are m arked as the border of bubbles (Figure 3-10). As 52  
shown in Figure 3-10, this threshold can di scard the irregular responses caused by a 
bubble that slips away from  the probe instead  of being pierced through. These irregular 
peaks are d ifficult to  define, and  may cause erro rs in m easurem ents. W ith this th reshold, 
the responses of the probe are transferred to a binary series, in which the value 1 
represents that the probe ’s tip is in the bubble, and the value 0 represents  that the tip is in 
the liqu id phase.

The value of  the threshold doe s not affect m uch the obtaine d value of the bubble velocity, 
since the bubble velocity is determ ined by th e tim e difference between the responses of 
different fiber tips to a bubble,  and the effect of  different threshold values is m inimized 
during the subtraction. 
 
However, the 60% threshold is too high for determ ination of the bubble chord length,  
because the width of th e bubble peak decrease s with its h eight (Figure 3-10), and  the 
width at the peak root repres ents the bubble chord length pier ced by the probe tip. Hence,  
a threshold of 1% is used to determ ine th e bubble chord length, i. e. the response points 
where the o utput of the probe increases 1% of the difference between  the baselin e and  the 
peak value are m arked as the border of bubbles to calculate th e bubble chord length 
(Figure 3-10).

When calculating the local gas holdup, all bubbles  that hit the central tip of the probe are 
used, i.e., there is no rejection of any bubbles. 
 
The threshold for the determ ination of gas hol dup should not be too high, as this woul d 
cause bubbles that tou ch the tip rather than  being pierced to be filtered out,  thus  
underestim ating the gas holdup. Obviously, it ca nnot be too close to zero either, as then 
unwanted noise would cause an overestim ate of the gas holdup. By using various 
threshold values, th, and calculating the gas holdup, εg, the re lation ship b etween εg and t h

A data pr ocessing algor ithm for the f our-poi nt optica l prob e was deve loped by Frijilink  
(1987) and his colleagues to get the bubble velocity and bubble c hord length. T his 
algorithm  ensures that all bubbles that do not f it the selected criterion, i.e., that do not 
move in the probe’s axial dire ction and are not being pierced centrally (F igure 3-12b), are  
rejected. First, the instants when a bubble hits a probe tip i, t i, are determ ined, and the 
time intervals ∆ti, i=1,2,3 , are calculated:

For an axially symmetric bubble m oving approxim ately in the probe’s axial direction and 
being pierced centrally, the differences between ∆ti, i=1,2,3, should be very sm all (Figure 
3-12a). Hence, the next step is  to evaluate whether the diffe rences in the bubble velocities 
calculated from  these three tim e interval s are less  than a given toleran ce δv (for example  
10%). If the m aximum difference b etween th ese three velo cities and  the mean of them  is 
greater than δv, then this particular bubble is disc arded. Otherwise, the bubble velocity is 
obtained as the m ean of the three v alues:

3.2.4  Measurement Errors of the Four-Poi nt Optical Probe (Old Algorithm) 
 
According to the data processing algorithm de scribed in Section 3.2.3, the four-point 
probe used in this work measures only bubbl es that move almost in the probe’s axial 
direction and are being pierced  in the vicinity of the bubble’s central line by the central 
tip of the probe. However, the movement of bubbles in bubble columns is rather 
complicated. Actually bubbles do not move vertic ally and straight, but rather in a zigzag 
or spiral pattern. Hence, if the probe is installed vertically in bubble columns, most 
bubbles will move in directions that deviate from the probe’s  axial direction, i.e., the 
vertical direction. 
 
Of course, it is not necessary that the prob e be installed verti cally. To reduce the 
deviation of the bubble motion from the probe’s axial direction, it would be desirable to 
place the probe in the direction of the moti on of most bubbles, if such exists, at each 
point in bubble columns. Unfortunately, it  has been found that bubble motion in bubble 
columns, including the movement directi on, keeps changing with the liquid flow 
direction all the time. There is no fixed pref erred flow direction at most places in bubble 
columns (Chen, Reese and Fan, 1994). As a resu lt, it is practically im possible to align the 
probe with the flow direction of bubbles, and many bubbles rise with a velocity direction 
that deviates from the probe’s  axial direction. Furthermore,  the position where the probe 
hits the bubble’s leadin g edge is random. Hence, the se lection function of the probe is 
difficult to apply efficiently. For example, in a 2-D column used, the bubble selection 
with this probe (with tolerance δv=10%, see Equation 3-11) caused more than 99% of 
bubbles that hit the probe to be  discarded. This high selectiv ity causes difficulty in data 
processing and interpretation. Therefore, to avoid a high discard ra tio of bubbles during 
the measurements, the effect of increasing the tolerance δ v was studied so that bubbles 
with movement that does deviate somewhat from the probe’s axial direction are also 
accepted. To do this in a systematic manne r, an error analysis was performed.

Figure 3 -15 shows the errors in m easurem ents by the probe predicte d by Equation (3-17). 
The range of angle ϕ is selec ted as 0~60o. This range covers all the cas es because o f the 
symmetry of the three peripheral tips of the probe. The range of angle θ is selected  also 
as 0~60o for the convenience of disp lay. In this range of θ and ϕ, the rela tive e rror in the 
magnitude of the bubble velocity component in the probe’s axial direction can be as large 
as 400%. At θ values larger than 60o, the relativ e errors are even larger.  It can be seen 
from  Figure 3-15 that the relative error is  affected m ainly by the valu e of angle θ. To 
keep the r elative e rror sm aller than 25 %, θ must be sm aller tha n 25o. 
 
Figures 3-16, 3-17, and 3-18 show the differe nce between the bubble ve locity determ ined 
by Tip i, v i i=1,2,3, and the m ean of v 1, v2, and v 3. Assum e the toler ance, δv, for the 
bubble selection is s et to be 10%, i.e., a bubble will be accepted only if the relative 
differences between v 1, v2, v3 and th e mean, v, are all within  ±10% (refer to Equation 3-
11). From  Figures 3-16, 3-17, a nd 3-18, it can be seen that all bub bles with a ve locity 
vector that deviates from  the probe’s axial direction within 20o will b e accep ted. The 
relative e rror in th e bub ble veloc ity at θ=20o is about 15% according to  Figure 3-1 5. If 
the tole rance, δv, is set to be 20%, the toler ated range of  θ by the probe measurem ent will 
be large r than 30o. At θ=30o, the relative error in the bu bble velocity is about 40% 
according to  Figure 3-15 .

It should be noted that the above error anal ysis is based on the assum ption that bubbles 
are strictly axially symm etric, e.g., ellipso idal bubbles, or else unpred ictable errors  can 
arise. Moreover, the definition of an irre gular bubble’s geom etric center and centerline 
are m eaningless. However, as we know, in bubble colum ns the bubbles’ shapes always 
deviate from being strictly symm etric. Even  in bubbly flow, m ost bubbles are not axially 
symmetric, as shown in Figure 3-19,  let a lone in trans ition flow and chur n-turbu lent flow. 
Due to the interaction between bubbles, usua lly single bubbles have a more regular shape 
than bubbles in clusters. At high gas holdup mo st bubbles are in clusters rather than 
moving alone. Moreover, bubbles  keep fluctuating during m ovement, and the interaction 
of the bubble with the probe tip deform s the bubble shape. These factors m ake the bubble 
shape in m ultiphase system s, e.g.,  bubble column s, very difficult to define and predict. 
Hence, it is not wise to base the alg orithm  on a stric t assu mption of  axially sym metric 
bubbles.

Furthermore, the bubble selecti on function of this four-poi nt optical probe needs the 
configuration of the probe tip to be exactly the same as that shown in Figure 3-4, i.e., 
three of the four tips of the probe must be of the same length and form an equilateral 
triangle. The fourth, central tip is positioned through the inertial center of this triangle. 
Due to the error in the fiber tip positioni ng and the stress arising during the gluing 
process, it is very difficult to satisfy this requirement precisely during the production of 
the four-point probe. In this study, most probes deviated somewhat from such exact 
configuration. When the three peripheral tip s are not of the same length, the difference 
can be compensated for by measuring the distances  of tips, 1, 2, and 3, from the central 
tip. However, by the use of the old algorithm, any deviation of the pr obe’s four tips from 
the desired horizontal configur ation, i.e. the central ti p being positioned through the 
inertial center of the equilate ral triangle formed by the thre e peripheral tip s, cannot be 
compensated for. Such a compensation would require information on the bubble shape, 
e.g., the aspect ratio and size for ellipsoidal bubbles, which are the parameters that the probe was designed to measure. Hence, any deviation of the real probe from the ideal configuration is also a source of error in the bubble ve locity and bubble size obtained by 
the old algorithm for the four-point optical probe. 
 
Since the bubble chord length is obtained by the product of the bubble velocity and the 
time interval that the probe tip spends in the bubble, the error in the bubble velocity will be transferred to the bubble chord length obt ained by the four-point probe. However, 
when the bubble velocity vector  deviates from the probe’s ax ial direction, even if the 
magnitude of the bubble velocity can be m easured accurately, the bubble chord length 
pierced by the probe’s central tip cannot be obtained correctly because the probe 
measures only the vertical component of th e bubble velocity. In the case shown in Figure 
3-20, the central tip of the probe passes th rough the central line of the bubble. The 
magnitude of the component of the bubble veloci ty vector in the probe ’s axial direction is 
v⋅cosθ. The time interval during which the probe ’s central tip stay s in the bubble is αa/v 
in this case, where a is the length of the major axis of the ellipsoid al bubble, and 
α=(length of the minor axis)/(length of the majo r axis) is the aspect ratio of the bubble. 67  
The length of the bubble’s m inor axis is obtained  as the product of these two values, i.e., 
αa⋅cosθ, by the existing algorithm . This value is  actually the length OB in Figure 3-20, 
which is different from  the length of the bubbl e’s m inor axis OA. Ac tually the length OB 
is physically m eaningless.

To sum  up: 
 
(1) The deviation of the bubble velocity vector  from  the probe’s axial direction can cause 
errors in the bubble velocity and bubble size obtained by the four-point optical probe. 
Although the bubble selection criterion δv in Equation (3-11b) can ensure that bubbles 
whose velocity vectors deviate significantly  from  the probe’s ax ial direction are 
discarded, thus reducing the m agnitude of the errors caused by the deviation of the 
bubble velocity vector from  the probe’s axial di rection, the application of this four-point 
probe in bub ble colum ns is still no t satisfactory. 
 
(2) The original algorithm  requi res the bubble shape to be axia lly symm etric, which is far 
from  the physical reality in  bubble colum ns, especially in the transition and churn-
turbulent flow regim e.  68
 
(3) It is technically difficult to  configure the probe tips accura tely as required by the old 
algorithm. 
 
(4) As a result of the bubble selection function of the f our-point probe, only a small 
percentage of bubbles are measured by the pr obe. By selecting bubbles  that hit the probe, 
a specific population of bubbles (e.g., bubbles m oving in the probe’s axial direction) in 
bubble columns is used to determine the bubble velocity and size distribution, instead of 
the whole bubble population. Howeve r, there is no firm theoreti cal or experimental proof 
which assures that the velocity and size of the whole bubble population are similar to that 
of this specific bubble population. Most  likely, they are not similar. 
 
To solve the problems described above, an  appropriate modification of the data 
processing algorithm of the four-point probe is developed. This modification is described 
in the next section. 
 
3.3  New Data Processing Algorithm for the Four-Point Probe 
 
A new data processing algorithm capable of determining both the magnitude and the 
direction of the bubble velocity vector is proposed and developed. Moreover, the specific 
interfacial area now can also be determin ed directly from the probe’s response. 
 
To determine the bubble velocity vector, its magnitude, v, and direction angles, θ and ϕ  
(refer to Figure 3-21b), need to be measure d. Hence, three equations including these three 
variables are needed to obtain the bubble velo city vector. If a four-point probe is 
considered as being comprised of three two-point probes in different directions (Figure 3-
21a), the responses of the three two-point probe s that comprise a four-point probe provide 
these three needed equations. 
 69  
Figure 3-21b shows the geom etry when a bubble hits the pr obe at an angle θ to the 
probe’s axial directi on. Assum e that the bubble is elli psoidal and the bubble velocity 
vector is perpendicular to the symm etry plane of the bubble (the plane for med by the  
major axes of the bubble). To se t up the equations that descri be the physical situation, the 
coordinate transform ation shown in Figure 3-14  is m ade. The xyz coordinate system  is 
transform ed to x’y’z’ system  with its z’-a xis in the direction of the bubble velocity 
vector. The relationship between coordinates x’, y’, z’ and x, y, z is explained in Equation 
(3-13). After this coordinate transform ation, the z’ coordinates of the four probe tips are:

where the coordinates of the probe tips in th e xyz coordinate system  shown in Figure 3-

 70  
Notice that the z i’ coordinate value of Tip i, i=1,2, 3, is the distance b etween Tip i and 
Tip0 in the direction of the bubble velocity  vector (Figure 3-21) . Accounting for the 
curvatu re correction (ex plained in S ection 3. 1, Figure 3-2), the tim e intervals between the 
instant when a bubble hits the central tip, Ti p0, and when it hits Tip i, i=1,2,3 are:

This group of nonlinear equations f or v, θ and ϕ does not yield analyt ical so lutions . The 
equations need to be solved  num erically, e.g., with a Newton-Raphson algorithm . As a  
result, th e velocity m agnitude, v, and the direction angles, θ and ϕ, of the bubble velocity 
vector are obtained. Based on these values , the bubble chord length pierced by Tip i, L i, 
i=0, 1, 2, 3, can be obtained by: 
 
i i Tv L⋅=           ( 3-19) 
 
The chord length distribution obtained by the pr obe then needs to be transfor med to the  
‘equivalent’ bubble diameter dist ribution. Liu et al. (1996, 1998) developed an algorithm 
to transform the bubble chord length distri bution obtained by a two- point probe to the  
bubble size distribution when bubbl es are spherical, ellip soidal or truncated ellipso idal. 
To use this algorithm , the aspect ratio of the bubbles, α=(length of m inor axis)/(length of 
major axis), in the system needs to be  known or assum ed in advance. Usually α is 
empirically set as a single value. However, in bubble colum ns α is not a single value but  
a distributio n, and there is no way t o estim ate the m ean aspect ratio in advance. Hence,  
this oversimplification m ay cause large e rrors in the transfor mation of bubble chord 
length distribution to bubble size distribution. B esides, Liu’s algorithm  is ve ry sen sitive 71  
to errors in the bubble chord length distribution, i.e., sm all changes in the bubble chord 
length distribution obtained m ay cause significant changes in  the bubble size distribution 
calculated.  Hence, Liu’s algorithm  for the tran sfer of the bubble chord length distribution 
to the bubble diam eter distribution is not rea lly applicable to bubble colum ns. So far, 
there is no other reported algorithm for th e transform ation of the bubble chord length 
distribution to the bubble size distribution. 
 
As to the four-point optical probe, af ter the bubble chord le ngths are obtained, 
theoretically the bubble size can  be calculated based on the assum ption of the bubble 
shape. The algorithm  is explai ned below, and is valid not on ly for ellipsoidal bubbles but  
also for any bubble whose shape can be expr essed m athem atically. Assum e that the 
bubble is ellipsoidal, with the m inor axis as the revolution axis, as shown in Figure 3-22a. 
The equatio n of the ellipsoid in Figure 3-22b is , where α is the aspect 
ratio and c is a half of the length of the m ajor axis. From  Figure 3-22b it can be seen that 
in the above equation x is the distance between  the chord pierced by the probe’s tip to the  
bubble’s center O, i.e., the length OC, and y equals half of the chord length, L22 22 2c x y α=α+
i/2. 
 
The four bubble chord lengths obtained by the f our tips of the probe give four equations:

Figure 3-22.  Determination of th e Bubble Si ze and Aspect Ratio 
 
The advantage of this transform ation algorit hm over the m ethods suggested by Liu et al.  
(1996, 1998) is that the aspect ratio of the bubble, α, can be obtained experim entally 
instead of being assum ed. This is important, since as m entioned above it m ay cause large 
error s to se t α as a single value. 
 
Unfortunately, the m easurem ents in a 2D bubble colum n conducted in  this study show 
that the proposed algorithm based on soluti on of Equations (3-20a-d) does not give an 
accurate estim ate of either bubble size or asp ect ratio (Appendix F). It was found that the 73  
algorithm  always underestim ates the bubble aspect  ratio, and is very sensitive to changes 
of the bubble chord lengths obtained by the probe, i.e., sm all changes in the bubble chord 
lengths m ay cause large variations in the ca lculated bubble size and aspect ratio. In 3D 
bubble colu mns, the shape of bubbles deviate s much m ore from  ellipsoid al than in th e 2D 
bubble column at very low gas holdup. Hence, it  is expected that th e error in the bubble 
sizes and as pect ratios o btained by the four- point probe will be even larg er in 3D bubble 
colum ns. As a result, this m ethod is not recommended to investigate the bubble size and 
shape in bubble colum ns. Inst ead, the bubble chord length di stributions obtained by the 
four-point probe were used to gain info rmation on the bubble size distribution in bubble 
colum ns, e.g., to determ ine whether the bubble size distribution in chur n-turbulent flow is 
bimodal or single m odal. 
 
One of the assum ptions for all of the above analysis is that the bubble velocity vector 
aligns with the bubble orientation.  Usually this is tr ue, due to the balanc e of the forces on 
bubbles and the shape flexibility of gas bubb les. However, when the bubble’s m otion 
direction changes signif icantly a s sometimes in churn-tu rbulent flow, it was observed that 
the bubble velocity vector m ight deviate from  the norm al vector of the bubble’s 
symmetry plane by an angle, φ, as shown in Figure 3-23a.  This deviation m ay cause 
errors in the bubble velocity vector and bubble chord length obtaine d by the four-point 
optical probe. 
 
From  Figure 3-23c, it can be derived that th e tim e inte rvals b etween the instant when  a 
bubble hits the central Tip0 and wh en it hits Tipi, i=1,2,3 are:

Figure 3-23.  The Physical Situation of the Bubble Velocity Measurements 
 75  
Since there are only  three equa tions (equations 3-22a, 3-22b, 3-22c) for four variables, 
i.e., v, θ, ϕ and φ, what c an be obtained is θ, ϕ and φ⋅cosv  instead of v and φ separate ly. 
Correspondingly, the chord length obtained by the probe is φ⋅⋅cosTvi . In cas es of 
Figure 3-23a, the chord length from the point  where the probe’s cen tral tip hits  the 
bubble’s surface, A, is AC, but φ⋅⋅ cosTv0  is actually the length AD. Hence, in  the cas e 
where the bubble velocity vect or does not align with th e bubble’s orientation, the 
determ ined bubble velocity vector and bubble chord length contain a system atic error. 
However, the erro r is sm all when the  value of  φ is sm all. 
 
Lim and Agarwal (1992) found th at in a 2-D fluidized bed φ had a norm al distribution 
with a m ean of zero and standard deviation of 14o. This f act im plies  that the  bubble 
velocity aligns with the bubble orientation with a sm all variation. S ince cos(14o)=0.97,  
the standard deviation of 14o implies that the error in the bubble velocity due to φ is 
small. Kataoka, Ishii and Serizawa (1986) adopted an upper lim it of 10o~22o for φ under 
different operating conditions in air-water bubbly and slug fl ow in a vertical tube of inner 
diam eter of 6 cm . At φ=22o, cosφ=0.927. Hence, it is expected that the error in the bubble 
velocity m agnitude due to the deviation of the bubble velocity vector from  the bubble 
orientation is sm all, and the bubble velocity  vector and bubble c hord length obtained by 
Equation (3-18) and (3-19) ar e reliable. Coincid entally,  Equation (3-22) provides a way 
to calcu late the specific interfacial area as explained below.  
 
Kataoka, Ishii and Serizawa (1986) derived th e equation for the specific interfacial area, 
a, in gas-liq uid  system s as:  
 
∑φ⋅⋅∆=

where N is the total nu mber of the gas-liqui d interfaces  passing by  the probe du ring the 
measurem ent tim e ∆T, and φ is the angle between the velocity vector and the norm al 
vector of the gas-liquid interface (e.g ., the bubble’s surface). 
 
Based on Equation (3-23), the four-point optic al probe can be em ployed to obtain the 
specific interfacial area. The phys ical situation is shown in Figure 3-24. Assum e that the 
gas-liquid in terface (bub ble surface) section  between the three tips, T ip1, Tip2 and Tip3, 
of the probe (Figure 3-24a) is flat. Consideri ng the sm all siz e of the p robe tip (1.2 mm in 
diam eter), this is a reasonable as sumption except when the probe hits a gas-liquid 
interface with large cu rvature, e.g., b ubbles of very sm all horizontal d imension. 
 
Note that th e bubble leading edges and traili ng edges both  should be acco unted for in the 
specific interfacial area,  and the cu rvature co rrection  mentioned abov e (Figu re 3-2) is 
unnecessary  (that curv ature corr ection is valid only for m easurements of  the veloc ity of  
the bubble’s centro id instead of the v elocity of the bubble surface section ).

By solving these th ree equations  numerically, the valu e of φ⋅cosv  can be obtained, 
which can then be used to obtain the spec ific interfacial area from  Equation (3-23). 
However, if a bubble hits the central tip of the probe bu t misses som e of the three 
peripheral tips, then the bubble surface velocity  vector can not be obtained, due to the  
insufficient num ber of equations, although this bubble contributes to the specific 
interfacial area at the probe’s  central tip. To account fo r the contribution of these 
“missed” bubbles, the average value of φ⋅cosv  of bubbles that pass all the f our tip s of 
the probe will be ass igned to these “m issed” bubbles. Hence, the equation for the 
calculation of specific interfacial area is:

Equations (3-24) and (3-25) do not need a ssumptions about bubble shape. Thus, errors 
due to the in accuracy  in the bubble shape assu mption can  be avoided, leading to  a robust 
algorithm . 
 
In churn-turbulent flow, the sh ape of m any bubbles is high ly irregular, and cannot be 
described as any sim ple geom etric shape, es pecially for large bubbles. Nevertheless, the 
Sauter m ean bubble diam eter (the v olume-surf ace m ean diam eter of bubbles) as sh own in  78
Equation (2-2) is widely employed to describe the bubble size. To obtain the Sauter mean 
diameter, bubbles’ volumes need to be measur ed. However, it is im possible to obtain the 
bubble volume accurately with the current techniques. Hence, another way is needed to 
derive the Sauter mean diameter. 
 
With the simplification of assuming spheri cal bubbles, the gas-liqui d interfacial area can 
be related to the gas holdup, εg, and the Sauter mean diameter, d s, as given by Equation 
(2-1). With the local specific interfacial ar ea and gas holdup obtained by the four-point 
probe, the Sauter mean bubble diameter at di fferent positions in bubble columns can be 
calculated by Equation (2-1). However, this should be treated only as a rough estimate of 
bubble size. 
 
In conclusion, the advantages of this new da ta processing algorithm over the old one are: 
 
(1) Both the magnitude and the direction of the bubble velocity vector can be obtained. 
 
(2) The probe does not need to be aligned with the flow direction at different positions to 
ensure the accuracy of measurements. 
 
(3) There is no selection of bubbles that hit the probe moving in  the probe’s axial 
direction. Hence the whole bubble population in  bubble columns is used to determine the 
bubble velocity distribution an d bubble chord length distribution, instead of just a 
specific population of bubbles (e.g., bubbles moving in the probe’s axial direction). 
 
(4) The specific interfacial area can be obtained in a simple way. 
 
(5) Sauter mean bubble diameter can be reported based on sphericity assumption.  79
 
Chapter 4  Validation of Measurements by the 
Four-Point Optical Probe 
 
There are many additional factors, not previously discussed, that affect the measurements 
of bubble properties by the four-point optical probe in multiphase systems. For example, 
when a bubble hits a probe tip, the interacti on between the probe tip and the bubble dents 
the bubble’s leading edge. The extent of the inte raction and the dent depend on the 
physical properties of the liquid phase (surf ace tension, viscosity, polarity, and density), 
the properties of the probe (material, size,  shape), the bubble ve locity, and the bubble 
size. Hence, before the probe can be applied in actual bubble columns the probe 
measurements of bubble velocity distributi on, bubble chord length di stribution, local gas 
holdup, and specific interfacial  area must be validated. 
 
The validation of the probe is accomplished by comparing the local gas holdup, bubble 
velocity, and specific interfacial area obtai ned by the probe with those obtained by CCD 
cameras in the validation setups, e.g., a 2D bubble column. The measurements by the 
camera are believed to be accurate under these simple conditions. This chapter presents 
the validation results for the four-point optic al probe in an air-water system. Since the 
deformation of bubbles when they hit the probe also depends on th e physical properties 
of the liquid phase, it may be necessary to revalidate the probe specifically in liquids 
whose physical properties are very different  from water, e.g., some organic systems. 
 
4.1  Validation of the Bubble Velocity Vector 
 
Two CCD cameras were employed to perfor m the video imaging analysis. The CA-D6-
0256ECEW camera by DALSA provides a resolution of 260 ×260 pixels and a very high 
frame rate up to 955 frames per second (fps). The CA-D6-0256W camera provides a 
better resolution of 532 ×516 pixels and a frame rate up to 262 fps. The frame grabber and  80
the im aging processing software used  are the PIXCI D32 and XCAP by EPIX, 
respectively. Two setups were used to va lidate the bubble velocity obtained by the four-
point optical probe. Figure 4-1 shows the first experim ental setup, in which a bubble train 
is genera ted via a capillary that is placed at the bottom  of a rectangu lar containe r fille d 
with tap water. The optical p robe is placed ab out 2 cm  above the cap illary exit where 
bubbles m ove vertically (i.e., bubble wobbling has not caused too m uch deviation from  a 
vertical trajectory). The probe  tip is horizontally positione d at the center of the bu bble 
train so that the central tip of the probe pi erces the bubble in the direction of the m inor 
axis (Figure 4-2). The bubbles’ hitting the probe tip are film ed from  the side (Figure 4-1). 
The velocity of bubbles in the sam e bubble trai n is alm ost identical. By using capillaries 
of different diam eter, bubbles of differen t velocities and sizes can be generated.

A series of im ages that illus trate the pr ocess of a bubble approachin g and hittin g the 
probe tip are shown in Figure 4-2. In this ca se the vertical veloc ity of  bubbles is 24.6 
cm/s, and the horizontal and vertical dim ensions are 2.0 mm and 5.7mm , respectively. It  
can be seen that the bubble sh ape fluctuated greatly during  its ascendance.  Although it is 
hard to distinguish the bubble shape fluctu ation and the defor mation caused by the  
interaction with the pro be tip, it can  be estim ated that the ex tent of  the d eformation due to  
the probe is much s maller than the natural bubble shape fluctuation.  81

It was confirm ed by video im aging that th ere was no obvious change in the bubble 
velocity in this single bubble train case wh en a bubble was pierced by the probe tip in the  
range of bubble velocities and bubble sizes studied (22.1~27.4 c m/s and 2.6~3.1 mm i n

  83
As shown in Figure 4-4, it was found that the bubble velocity and chord length obtained 
by the four-point probe were always smaller than those obtained by the camera. This is 
possibly due to the deformation of the bubble leading edge by the probe tip, since it has 
been shown that hitting the probe tip does not  slow down the bubble. The relative errors 
in the bubble velocity and chord length obtaine d by the four-point probe are within –10% 
in the range of bubble veloci ty and bubble size studied (i.e., 22.1~27.4 cm/s and 2.6~3.1 
mm in volume equivalent diameter, respectiv ely). Hence, the bubble velocity and bubble 
chord length obtained by the fou r-point probe are reliable in this single bubble train case. 
 
The single bubble train case, as described above, is quite simple compared to the situation 
in bubble columns. Hence, the validation of the bubble velocity and specific interfacial 
area obtained by the four-point optical probe  were also conducted in a transparent 2D 
bubble column. The configuration of this second setup was shown in Figure 4-5. The 
dimensions of the 2D bubble column are 181.5(h) ×49.0(w)×1.3(d) cm. The gas 
distributor has 16 holes with di ameter of 1.0 mm, evenly dist ributed in a lin e. The probe 
was positioned in the centerline of the column, 96.8 cm  above the distributor. When 
validating the probe, in most cases a bubble  stream was generate d in the 2D bubble 
column using a single gas nozzle instead of th e gas distributor. Th e single gas nozzle was 
introduced into the bubble column through a connector, and was about 57 cm below the 
four-point probe tip (r efer to Figure 4-5). 
 
The reasons for using the single gas nozzl e to generate bubbles instead of the gas 
distributor are: 
 
(1) The imaging analysis software can rec ognize only a portion of the total bubbles and 
measure their velocity in 2D bubble columns. This is because bubbles of larger velocity 
tend to form clusters that ca nnot be recognized by the imagi ng processing software due to 
the overlap, coalescence, and di spersion of bubbles. Hence, bubbl es that move in clusters, 
which are of higher velocity, cannot be distinguished separately by the imaging 
processing software and were not measured. This omission causes errors in the bubble  84
velocity distribution and m ean bubble velo city obtained by the camera. Hence,  the 
imaging m ethod can be applied only at very  low gas velocity, in  which case the gas 
holdup is very low and bubbles are sparse. Howe ver, at very low ga s velocity bubbles 
were generated at only a portion of the holes  on the gas distributor, and the generation of 
bubbles usually is not continuous. 
 
(2) Bubbles of different sizes can  be generated using gas nozzles  of different sizes so that 
the probe validation can cover a range of bubb le size and velocit y. This is im possible 
using the gas distributor.

Figure 4-5.  Setup of the 2D Bubbl e Column for the Probe Validation 
 
In this 2D bubble column, th e bubble velocity distribution an d the m ean bubble velocities 
obtained by the probe and by the cam era wer e com pared, instead of com paring the 
bubble velo city of each single bubb le as in th e single bubble train set up (Figure 4-1 ). This 
approach is chosen for the following reasons : (1) Although the bubble colum n was said to 
be 2D, it is still 1.3cm  in depth. Hence, even  though the probe tip a nd a bubble overlap on  85
the photo taken by the cam era, it is possible that the bubble does not  contact the probe 
tip, due to the depth of the column. One ca nnot distinguish this situation from  real  
piercing; hence, it is difficu lt to cor relate the  individua l bubble velocity obtained by the 
probe to that obtained by the cam era on the one by one basis. (2) To describe the 
hydrodynamics in bubble colum ns, the bubble ve locity distributi on and m ean bubble 
velocity a re more valuab le than the  velocity  of each single bubble.  (3) To get the bubble 
velocity distribution, the velocity of hundred s or thousands of bubbles are needed, and it 
is too tim e consum ing to get the bubble velocities one by one. 
 
 Rotating bubble 
Rotating bubble 
Figure 4-6.  Rotation of Bubbl es in the 2D Bubble Column  
 
Furtherm ore, the cam era cannot m easure accu rately the bubble chord length pierced  by 
the probe tip in the 2D  bubble colum n for seve ral reasons: (1) Due to the depth of the 
colum n, the position where the probe tip h its the bubble cannot be determ ined on the 
photos. Hence, the chord length pierced by the probe tip cannot be determ ined by i mage 
analysis. (2) Bubbles rotate during their m ovement (Figure 4-6) so th at the projection of  86
the bubbles on the photos does not represent thei r real dimension. (3) Again, it is too time 
consuming to compare the bubble chord leng ths one by one. So, the bubble chord length 
obtained by the four-point probe was not va lidated directly by video imaging. It was 
validated indirectly as mentioned later. 
 
Hence, the local bubble velocity distribution at the central tip of the probe was measured 
by the four-point probe and by the camera, re spectively, and the results were compared 
for validation. Some examples of the bubble velocity distribution obtained by these two 
methods are shown in Figure 4-7. The mean bubbl e velocities are listed  in Table 4-1. The 
mean bubble sizes in terms of volume-equi valent diameter, obtained by the video 
imaging, are listed in the captions of the diagrams. 
 
It can be seen from Figure 4-7 that the bubble velocity distributions obtained by the probe in general match well with those obtained by the CCD camera. However, careful comparison of Figures 4-7a, 4-7b and 4-7c and the statistical parameters listed in Table 4-
1 reveals that for small bubbles the mean bubbl e velocity obtained by the probe is larger 
than that obtained by the camera. For large bubbles the reverse is observed, i.e., the relative error in the mean bubble velocity ob tained by the probe changes from positive to 
negative when the bubble size increases (Table 4-1). This may be caused by the fact that 
small bubbles of low velocity (momentum) tend to slip away from the probe tip instead 
of being pierced through (Chabot  et al., 1992). Large bubbles, ev en when their velocity is 
low, still have enough momentum to be pi erced through by the probe tip. Hence, more 
small bubbles of low velocity were not detected by the f our-point probe than large 
bubbles. As a result, the mean velocity for small bubbles is overestimated by the four-
point optical probe. 
 
For large bubbles, the probability density f unction (pdf) of the bubble velocity shifts 
toward the low value (Figure 4-7c). This is possibly because the deformation of the 
bubble surface by the piercing of the probe causes the bubble velocity obtained by the probe to be lower than the re al value (Figure 4-17), and th e deformation is more obvious  87
for large bubbles than for small bubbles. Furthermore, as shown in Figure 4-7b, the 
bubble velocity distribution obtai ned by the two-point probe has larger pdf values at both 
low velocity and high velocity. The larger pdf values at low velocity are caused by the fact that sometimes different bubbles hit the two tip s of the two-point probe successively. 
The algorithm for the two-point probe considers this case the same as the case when the 
same bubble hits the two tips successively. Because the bubbl es are sparse at low gas 
velocity, usually the time interval when two different bubbles hit the different tips of the 
probe is much larger than that when a singl e bubble hit the two tips successively. Hence, 
very low bubble velocities were derived in this ca se. It is noticed that this peak of the pdf 
at low velocity is clearly separated fr om the normal peak in the bubble velocity 
distribution obtained by the tw o-point probe (Figure 4-7b).  Hence, by removing the pdf 
peak at low velocity arbitrarily, the bubble velocity distribution obtained by the two-point 
probe match that obtained by cam era better. However, there is no physical rule that 
supports this removal and sometimes the pe ak at low velocity and the normal bubble 
velocity peak partly overlap and it is difficu lt to determine the criterion for the removal. 
The mean bubble velocities obtai ned by the two-point  probe displayed in Table 4-1 are 
obtained after the removal of the pdf peak at low velocity. As shown in Figure 4-7b and Table 4-1, the bubble velocity distribution obt ained by two-point probe has higher pdf 
values at high velocity and higher mean bubbl e velocity than values detected by camera 
and by the four-point probe. This confirms th e previous analysis that the error in the 
bubble velocity obtained by the two-point probe is always positive (Figure 3-3a). As illustrated in Appendix D.2, in a 3D bubble colu mn, the two-point probe did not generate 
reasonable bubble velocity distri butions, especially at high gas velocity. Hence, it is 
experimentally established that the bubble ve locity distribution ob tained by two-point 
probes is not as reliable as th at by the four-point probe, esp ecially in transition and churn-
turbulent flow regime.

4-8a, the angle between the bubb le velocity vector, v, and th e vertical di rection, z), 
obtained by the probe and by the cam era, re spectively.  It can be seen that the 
distributions by the two m ethods roughly agree in  shape, except at sm all values of angle 
θ, where higher probability values were obtained by the cam era. Correspondingly, the 
mean bubbl e direction angle obtai ned by the cam era is s maller than that obtained by the

These high  probability  values at small θ for the cam era m easurem ents are likely caused 
by the fact that the depth of the 2D bubble colum n is 1.3 cm , so the bubbles m ay have 
had a velocity com pone nt toward the depth direction, while the cam era can catch only the 
projection of the bubble velocity  vector (direction vector) in the yz plane, the plane 
formed by the width and height of the 2D bubbl e colum n (refer to Figure 4-9). S ince the 
direction angle, θ, is always larger than or equal to its projection on the yz plane, θ’, i.e., 
θ’ ≤ θ, the bubble direction angle obtained by the cam era is s maller than the real value, 
except when the bubble direction vector falls in the yz plane.  This lim itation results in 
high probab ility v alues at sm all direction angle s indicated by the cam era.

Experim ents that cover bubbles of different sizes (m ean dia meter of 0.23cm ~ 2.33 cm ) 
were conducted to validate the m ean bubble velocity obtained by the four-point probe. 
The 2D bubble colum n illustrated in Figure 4- 5 is not suitab le for large b ubbles because 
the sm all depth dim ension (1.3 cm ) makes larg e bubbles def orm and there is also a strong 
wall effect on their m ovement, so that the la rge bubble behavior is very different from 
that in bubble colum ns. Hence, a transparent pipe was used to validate the velocity of 
large bubbles obtained by the four-point probe. The configuration of the Plexiglas pipe is 
shown in Fi gure 4-10. The pipe is 5.5 c m in the inner diam eter and 105 cm in height. A 
single nozzle gas sparger was in stalled at the bottom  of the pipe. Bubbles of different 
sizes can be generated by em ploying gas nozzles  of different outlet sizes and by adjusting 
the gas velocity. It was proved by video im aging th at in the cen tral zone (3.0 cm in 
diam eter) of the column the distortion of th e im aging due to the effect of the wall 
curvature is negligible. The probe is positioned in the center of the pipe, about 98 c m 
from the bottom .

The validation results are shown in Figure 4- 11. The relativ e erro rs in the m ean bubble

Figure 4-11 displays the relative error in th e mean bubble velocity obtained by the four-

volum e-equivalent diam eter in the range of 0.23c m ~ 2.33cm  (Re b=737~10500,  
Eob=0.72~73.7), the re lative er ror in the m ean bubble velocity obtained by the four-point 
probe is within –11% ~ +6%, and  it changes fr om positive to negative with an increase in  
bubble size and velocity. The relative e rrors oscillate around –10% whe n Re b>4000 and 
Eob>10. Hence, the m ean bubble velocity obtai ned by the four-point probe is reliable 
with the range of error – 11% ~ +6% at the conditions employed in the validation.

Unfortunately, calibration of the m ean bubble velocity obtained by the four-point probe 
in bubble colum ns based on Figure 4-11 is no t possible. This is because the bubble 
volum e-equivalent diam eter, d e, cannot be determ ined by the four-point probe. As 
describ ed earlier, d e cannot be derived from  the bubbl e chord length obtained by the 
probe becau se the aspect ratio of th e bubble is unknown. Hence, the bu bble Reynolds 
number, Re b, and bubble Eotvos number, Eo b, are not available in bubble colum ns. Since 
the m ean bubble velo city obtained b y the f our-p oint probe is  reliable, it will be ac cepted 
without calibration.

4.2  Validation of the S pecific Interfacial Area 
 
In the case of spherical bubbles, the relationshi p between the specific interfacial area and 
the bubble size distribution is sim ple, and can  be described by (Patel, D aly and Bukur, 
1989): 
 
sg
d6aε=          ( 4-3) 
 
In Equation  (4-3),  a is th e specific interfacial area, εg is the gas holdup, and d s is the  
Sauter m ean diam eter (th e average vol ume-surface m ean diam eter of bubbles) as 
described in Equation (2-2). 
 
It is well kn own that m ost bubbles are not sphe rical in m ost practical m ultiphase sys tems. 
When bubbles are not spherical,  e.g., ellipsoidal, the relationship between the specific 
interfacial area and the bubble size distribution is much m ore com plicated than Equation 
(4-3). Assum e that the ellips oidal bubble has two m ajor axes , c, and one m inor axis, b. 
The three axes of an ellipsoid al bu bble are c, c, b, where c>b, and α=b/c is the aspect 
ratio of the bubble. Then the surface area of  the bubble is:

Since the aspect ratios of bubbl es in bubble columns are not identical, it is evident from  
Equations (4-6) and (4-7) that there is no simple correlation be tween mean bubble size, 
gas holdup and specific interfaci al area for ellipsoidal bub bles, let alone bubbles of 
irregu lar sh ape. Furthermore, for ellipsoid al bubbles Equation (4-3) does not hold even 
when the aspect ratio of  bubbles is identical.  Assum ing that the size and aspect ratio of 
all bubbles in bubble colum ns are identical, Fi gure 4-12 shows the re lative error in the 
specific in terfacial area calculated  according to Equation  (4-3). It can be seen that 
Equation (4-3) always underestim ates the interf acial area. The sm aller the aspect ratio, 
the larger the relative error.  In other words, the m ore the bubble shape deviates from  
spheric al, the larger the rela tive error in the specific interfacial area obta ined by Equa tion 
(4-3). The relative error is –55% at aspect ratio α=0.5, and becom es about –100% when 
α goes to zero. In the case of differe nt bubbl e sizes and aspect ratio s for the whole bubble 
population, the relative error in  the specific interfacial area is the combination of that 
shown in Figure 4-12, and is exp ected to be of the sam e orde r of m agnitude as that shown 
in Figu re 4-12. It is  obvious by  this sim ulation  that the error in the specific interf acial 
obtained by Equation (4-3) m ay be very larg e for nonspherical bubbles. Hence, Equation 
(4-3)  is an o versim plification f or practical multiphase sys tems, and it c an be trea ted o nly 
as a rough estim ate of the specific interfaci al area and Sauter mean bubbl e diam eter.  98

Obtained b y Equation (4-3) 
 
However, for sim plification, researchers ofte n assum e bubbles are of  spherical shape in 
multiphase system s, e.g., bubble colum ns, and then em ploy Equation (4-3) to get the 
specific interfacial area f rom the gas holdup and Sauter m ean bubble diam eter. Obviously 
this is not accurate  for alm ost any bubble column. Ho wever, the error caused by this 
simplificatio n has never been analyzed or mentioned. Equation (4-3) was em ploye d in 
this study to get the Sauter m ean bubble diam eter in order to com pare it with the results 
of other researchers, and in order to qualita tively study the ef fect of operating conditions 
on the Sauter m ean bubble diam eter. 
 
 
 
  99
The validation of the specific interfacial ar ea measurement obtained by the four-point 
probe against video imaging was also c onducted in the 2D bubble column shown in 
Figure 4-5. The video imaging analysis of th e specific interfacial area was performed as 
follows: 
 
(1) Bubbles were assumed to be ellipsoidal, so each bubbl e in a photo frame was mapped 
to an approximate ellipsoid. 
 
(2) With the length of the major axis, c, and the aspect ratio of the ellipsoid, α, of the 
approximate ellipsoid, the surface area of the bubble, a, was calculated with Equation (4-
4). 
 
(3) A small region around the centr al tip of the probe (about 2 ×2cm) is selected, and the 
surface area of each bubble in this small region was summed up and divided by the 
volume of the region to obtain the specific interfacial area in this region. 
 
The results are listed in Table 4-3. Bubbles of different Re b and Eo b were generated, and 
the specific interf acial areas at different condi tions were measured. The Re b and Eo b were 
adjusted by generating bubble streams of different mean bubble sizes. Due to the 
simplifying assumption of ellipsoidal bubble sh ape, the specific inte rfacial area obtained 
by the video imaging is expected to be smaller than the real value. This is because real bubbles are usually somewhat deformed from e llipsoidal shape, so that the surface area is 
larger than that of an ellipsoid of the same projected area on the photo by the CCD camera. Hence, the specific area obtained by video imaging should be treated only as a 
reference rather than a standard. It can be s een from Table 4-3 that the specific interfacial 
area obtained by the four-point probe is appr oximately equal to that obtained by video 
imaging. The relative errors are positive and within 23%. Hence, the specific interfacial area obtained by the four-point probe seems to be reasonable. Due to the inherent 
inaccuracy of the specific in terfacial area obtained by the video imaging, no more runs 
were conducted.  100

4.3  Validation of the Local Gas Holdup 
 
The validation of the local gas holdup obtained by the probe  was conducted in the setup 
shown in Figure 4-13. The column consists of an  outer pipe with an inner diameter of 5.5 
cm and a height of 105 cm, and an inner pipe  with an inner diameter of 0.6 cm and a 
height of 100 cm. A gas nozzle was installed at the bottom of the inner pipe. Taylor 
bubbles are generated at the bottom, and move  upward all the way through the inner pipe. 
By adjusting the valve on the liquid flow circuit,  the liquid flow rate in the inner pipe can 
be controlled. Since bubbles ri se with the liquid, the veloc ity of bubbles can also be 
adjusted in this way so that the gas holdup in the inner pipe can be adjusted. The probe is 
positioned in the center of the inner pipe, about 98 cm to the bottom.

It is im portant to recognize that the gas holdup obtained by the probe, which is tim e 
based, is a little different from  the volum e based gas holdup, which is commonly used. 
The definition of volum e based gas holdup is that it is the fraction of the whole 
multiphase system  volum e that is occupied by the gas phase. Based on this definition, the 
overall gas holdup in bubble colum ns can be m easured using the bed expansion m ethod 
as follows:

V,gHH H
V VV
VV −=+==ε       (4-8) 
 
where V G is the volum e occupied by  the gas phase (bubbles), V L is the volum e occupied 
by the liquid phase, V is the total volum e of the gas-liquid m ixed phase, H I is the initial 
liquid phase height, and H D is the dynam ic height of the gas-liquid system.

here, T G is the tim e the probe tip spends in the gas phase ( bubbles) and T is the total 
measuring tim e. 
 
Clearly the gas holdup obtained by Equation (4-8 ) is volum e based, and that obtained by 
Equation (4-9) is tim e based. The differen ce between thes e two defin itions  beco mes 
apparent by transform ing Equation (4-9) from tim e based to volum e based. As Figure 4-

In Equation (4-11c), v i is the velo city of th e ith gas-liquid interface (bubble leading

bubble columns v i are not independent of t G,i and t L,i because larg e bubb les m ove faster

Thus, a positive value of  tends to c orrelate to a  positive iv∆i,Gt∆ , and vice versa. This

operated in churn-turbulent fl ow som e small bubbles also e xhibit large velo cities because

corre lates to  negativ e . These two tendencies counteract, and Equation (4-13) is

obtained by the probe and by the cam era are disp layed in F igure 4-16. It can be seen that 
these two distribu tions match well, except tha t the probe gave a little higher probability a t 
small tim e interva ls than the cam era. This is because the interaction between th e prob e tip 
and the bubble’s leading edge  dents the bubble, and causes the chord length pierced by 
the probe tip to be sho rter than  the real v alue. This dent is  also th e reas on that the probe 
produced lower gas holdup values than the cam era. In conclusion, the tim e intervals that 
the probe’s central tip spent in bubbles obtained by the probe are reliable in this case.

Figure 4-17.  Deformation of the B ubble’s Leading Edge 
due to the I nteraction w ith the Probe Tip 
 
In the setup shown in Figure 4-13, bubbles ar e forced to m ove in the probe’s axial 
direction, i.e., vertical dire ction. However, as m entioned before, in bubble colum ns the 
direction of m otion for m any bubbles deviat es significantly from  the probe’s axial 
direc tion, d ue to the co mplexity of  the f low f ield. In this case, the de formation of  the 
bubble’s leading edge when it hi ts the probe tip m ay be m ore serious than that of bubbles 
that m ove in the probe’s axial d irection. This  is because in this case the p rojection of the 
probe’s tip on the bubble’s lead ing edge is large (Figure 4- 17), i.e., not only the optical 
fiber’s tip, but also a part of the fibe r body presses on the bubble’s leading edge and 
forces it to deform . As stated bef ore, the observed underestim ation of the local gas   108
holdup is possibly caused by the deformation of  the bubble’s leading edge. Hence, it is 
expected that larger deformation of the bubbl e’s leading edge causes larger error in the 
local gas holdup obtained by the probe.  
 
Furthermore, in the setup shown in Figure 4-13, bubbles are restricted  in the inner pipe, 
so there is no room for bubbles to slip away from the probe’s tip. This is different from 
the condition in bubble columns, where small bubbles may avoid the probe tip, due to the 
disturbance of the flow field by the probe (Chabot et al., 1992). Hence, it is expected that 
the error in the local gas hol dup obtained by the four-point probe in bubble columns will 
still be negative, and the relative errors are la rger than those shown in  Table 4-4. This is 
proved by the experiments conducted in a 3D bubble column as described later. 
 
The 2D bubble column is not suitable for the validation of the local gas holdup obtained 
by the probe. This is because in the 2D bubble column, the local gas holdup obtained by 
the camera is not accurate in the case of non-spherical bubbles, due to several factors: (1) 
To extract the local gas holdup by the camera, one needs to assume the shape of bubbles, 
e.g., to be ellipsoidal, and get the volume of bubbles from their projection on the CCD 
plane. Obviously the bubble volume obtained in  this way is not accurate for deformed 
bubbles. (2) When the major symmetry plan e of bubbles (the symmetry plane that 
contains the major axes of an ellipsoidal bubble)  is not vertical to the CCD plane (this is 
common, especially for small bubbles, which ro tate continuously during their rise), the 
profile of bubbles obtained w ill be larger than  the real value (refer to Figure 4-5). 
Moreover, as mentioned before, the local ga s holdup cannot be determined in the 2D 
bubble column at relatively hi gh gas holdup, as in bubble colu mns, due to the overlap of 
bubbles. Hence, the verification of the lo cal gas holdup obtained by the probe was not 
conducted in the 2D bubble column. 
 
As described before, the bubble chord lengt hs being pierced by the probe cannot be 
derived accurately by the camera in the 2D bubble column. Howeve r, the bubble chord 
length is obtained by the produc t of the bubble velocity, v, a nd the time interval that a  109
probe tip spent in that bubble, T i: i i Tv L⋅= . Hence, it is reasonab le to assert that after the 
validation of the bubble velocity and the tim e intervals that a probe tip spent in bubbles, 
the bubble chord lengths obtained by the probe are also indirectly validated. 
 
In conclusion, the validation against vide o im aging shows that the bubble velocity 
distribution, m ean bubble velo city, bubble chord length distri bution, specific interfacial 
area, and local gas holdup obtai ned by the four-point optical probe are reliable. H ence, 
the probe is applied in bubble columns at different operati ng conditions to investigate 
bubble properties in system s of practical interest.  110
 
Chapter 5  Bubble Properties in Bubble Columns 
Obtained by the Four-Point Optical Probe 
 
After validation of the four-point optical pr obe measurements in 2D systems, the probe 
was utilized in 3D bubble co lumns under specified operating conditions of interest to 
measure the bubble velocity distribution, bubbl e chord length distribution, local gas 
holdup, and specific interfacial area. 
 
5.1  Experimental Setup 
 
The configuration of the 16.2 cm (6.4”) diamet er stainless steel bubble column is shown 
in Figure 5-1. The setup was ope rated in the batch mode with tap water as the liquid 
phase and filtered, dry compressed air as the gas phase. The four-point probe 
measurements were conducted at different gas velocities and at atmospheric and high 
pressures. The operating conditions employed are listed in Table 5-1. Three axial 
positions, i.e., z/D= 1.7, 5.1, and 8.5, a nd seven radial positions, i.e., r/R= ±0.9, r/R=±0.6, 
r/R=±0.3 and r/R=0, (where positive and negative va lues of r/R represent different sides 
along the diameter of the column in the plane of measurement, Figure 5-1), were selected 
for measurements of the local bubble propertie s. The optical probe must employ the fixed 
ports on the column wall.  Due to the physical limitation of the column, i.e., the ports are 
all located on the same vertical plane (Figur e 5-1), the radial measuring positions at each 
axial position are along one diameter and the measurements of the bubble properties were 
conducted at one single vertical plane and one angular position in the column. The 
configuration of the spargers used is shown in Figure 5-2 and Table 5-2.

The operating conditions were the same as those used for the CT and CARPT 
experiments conducted in CREL (Boon Che ng Ong, 2003). The axial measurement 
positions are a little different from thos e in the CT experiments (z/D= 2.1, 5.5, 9.0) 
because the optical probe must employ the fi xed ports on the column wall, while the CT 
can be positioned freely anywhere along the axial direction. The operating principle of 
the four-point probe, discussed earlier, ensures that it accurately measures bubbles 
moving upwards when it is positioned downwar ds, and vice versa. Visual observation 
indicates that many bubbles move downwards in bubble columns in transition flow and churn-turbulent flow, especia lly in the wall zone. Hence,  the four-point probe was 
positioned in two directions at each measuring site, i.e., upwards and downwards, and the probe tip was positioned at the same point when the probe was positioned upwards or downwards (Figure 5-1). In this way bot h bubbles moving upwards and those moving 
downwards can be measured, instead of onl y bubbles moving upwards as done in most 
other studies involving probes. 
 
5.2  Comparison of the Gas Holdup Pr ofile Obtained by Probe and by CT 
 
The radial profiles of local gas holdup obtai ned by CT (data of Boon Cheng Ong, 2003, is 
used) and by the four-point optical probe  were compared. If the gas holdup profile 
obtained by the two techniques matched well,  and the integrated cross-sectional gas 
holdup matched the overall gas holdup obtained by the bed expansion height method within reasonable error, th en one could claim that both the gas holdup profile obtained by 
CT and by the four-point optical probe method are reliable. 
 
Figure 5-3 displays an example of the co mparison of mean gas holdup radial profiles 
obtained by CT and the four-point optical probe  at atmospheric pressure. Detailed results 
can be found in Appendix D. The value of the gas holdup obtained by the probe shown in 
Figures 5-3 and 5-4 is the mean of the values at the symmetric radial positions in the 
column along the single chord, i.e. for r/R=0.3 the gas holdup is the mean of the values 
obtained at r/R= ±0.3. It can be seen that at atmospheri c pressure the results of CT and the  114
probe m atch well, with r elative e rror less than ±15% in m ost cases (refer to Table B-1).

Figure 5-3.  Comparison of Gas Holdup by CT and by Pro be at Atmospheric 
        Pressure (Sparger #2) 
 
It can be seen from  Figure 5-3b that the cross-sectional gas holdup obtained by CT and 
by the probe m atch the overall gas holdup pretty  well at atmospheric pressure. Both of 
them  are s maller than the overall gas holdup,  with relative errors  of –10%~-18%. Hence, 
at atm ospheric pressure, both the C T and the four-point optical probe provide reasonable  
gas holdup  values with negative system atic erro rs of accep table m agnitude for 
engineering estim ates. 
 
Figure 5-4 displays the com parison of gas holdup profiles obtained by CT and by the 
probe at both atm ospheric and high pressures for sparger #3. It  can be s een that for this  
sparger at atmospheric pressure the gas holdup profiles obtained by these two m ethods  
match well. At high pressures the gas holdup obtained by CT and by the probe obviously 
deviate fro m each other and  the gas holdup ob tained by th e probe is always larger than 
that obtained by CT. Fr om Table 5-3, it can be s een that at h igh pressu re the relative erro r 
in the cross sectional gas holdup obtained by CT  and the overall holdup can be as large as 
–37.2% (0.4MPa), while that obtained by the probe  is still within the sam e range a s at 
atmospheric pressure. Since th e cross-sectional gas holdup obta ined by the probe fits the  116
overall gas holdup better than that obtained by CT at high pressure, it is believed that the 
probe still gave reliable gas holdup m easurem ents at h igh pressure. Th e reason for the 
large erro rs in the gas holdup obtained by CT at high pressu re is still unkn own and should  
be investigated. It should be noted that  although CT holdup m easure ments and probe 
measure ments were done at identical conditi ons in the sam e size colum n, the tap water 
used was dif ferent and the ax ial po sition s for measurem ents ar e abou t 2 inche s apart. 
Water im purities are known to affect th e gas holdup (Tang an d Heindel, 2004).

5.3  The Effect of Superficial Gas Velocity 
 
The superficial gas velocity, Ug, is one of the key operating variables that affects the 
hydrodynamics in bubble columns, including b ubble properties. The effect of Ug on 
bubbles at atmospheric pressure in bubble colu mns was investigated in this study. Figure 
5-5a shows the radial prof iles of local gas holdup, ε g,l, at different Ug and the changes of 
εg,l with Ug at different radial positions. The erro r bars are also displayed. It is clear from 
Figure 5-5a that the radial pr ofile of local gas holdup is fl at at Ug=2 cm/s, which is 
bubbly flow. The local gas holdup profile is parabolic when Ug is larger than 8 cm/s, 
when the flow changes from transition flow to churn-turbulent fl ow. Furthermore, the 
higher the gas velocity, the steeper the pa rabolic profile. These observations are 
corroborated with the CT experi mental results. It is also no ticed that the bubble properties 
are not strictly symmetric in the radial direction in the ra nge of measurements. Visual 
observation through the windows on the column wall indicates the asymmetry of the flow 
in the column. Possible causes for the asymme try could be the bubble column alignment 
departure from verticality, lack of symme try for the sparger used, and the coherent 
structure in the flow (Groen et al., 1996). In the following text, if the bubble properties 
are alike at symmetric radial positions then only bubble properties at one side are shown, 
e.g. if the bubble chord length distribution at r/ R=0.9 and r/R=-0.9 is alike, so only the 
one at r/R=-0.9 is shown. 
 
It is found that the radial profiles of both specific inte rfacial area (Figure 5-5b) and 
bubble frequency (the number of bubbles that hit the central tip of the probe per second) 
and their changes with Ug are similar to the radial profile  of the local gas holdup. The 
similarity between these profiles is the result  of the fact that lo cal gas holdup, specific 
interfacial area and bubble frequency are st rongly correlated. Speaking generally, an 
increase in bubble frequency leads to an incr ease in gas holdup and specific interfacial 
area.

The radial profiles of mean bubble velocity at  different Ug are shown in Figure 5-6. The 
positiv e value of bubble velocity means that bubbles m ove upwards, while th e negative 
value m eans that bubbles m ove downwards. The m ean bubble velocity, bv, is the  sum  of 
the bubble velocities divided by the bubble numbers:

As expected, the radial profile  of mean bubble velocity was flat at Ug=2 c m/s, whi ch is 
bubbly flow, and it was parabolic w hen Ug was la rger than 8 cm /s, when flow changes to 
transition flow and churn-turbulent flow (Fi gure 5-6a). F igure 5-6b shows that th e mean 
bubble velocity was always positiv e and increased with Ug in the core of the colum n, and 
the rate of increase in the m ean bubble velo city with Ug in the bubbly flow regim e was 
faster than in the  chur n-turbu lent flow regim e. In the wa ll zon e (r/R=±0.9), bv was 
positiv e in bubbly flow (Ug = 2c m/s) and was sm all or even negativ e at Ug>8 cm /s. 
Above Ug of 14 cm /s, the m agnitude of bv increas ed slowly with Ug; in the range of  Ug 
investigated (Ug = 2~60 c m/s) the m inimum bv was detected at Ug= 8cm /s, in the 
transition regim e from bubbly flow to churn-turbulent flow , in the wall zone.

Figure 5-6.  The Radial Prof ile of Mean Bubble Veloc ity and Its Change w ith Ug 
              (Sparger #2, z /D=5.1) 
 
The bubble velocity distribution in the wall zone (Figure 5-7, r/R= ±0.9, z/D=5.1)  
obtained by the four-point optical probe cl arifies the observed behavior for the mean  121
bubble velocity, bv. It should be noted that a larg e portion of bubbles of very low 
velocity can not be m easured by the probe. This  is becaus e it takes relativ ely long  time for 
very slow bubbles to pass through the four tips of the probe. During this tim e interval if  
the flow field around the bubble changes, th e bubble velocity also  changes during its 
passage by the probe since bubbles move with liquid flow. In this  case the velocity of the 
bubble determ ined by the four-point probe is a mean of the  early slow velocity and the 
later high velocity. Hence, th e four-point probe tends to underestim ate the probability of 
bubbles of very low velocity. However, it shou ld be noted that this bias is usually not  
significan t because th e vertical d istance between  the central tip and the other tips of the 
probe is  about 2 m m, if the tim e scale of  the f low field change is 0.1 s, then only bubbles 
with velocity lower than about 2 cm /s will be  affected. Usually the percentage of bubbles 
with velo city as low a s this is v ery low.  The bias happens both for bubbles that move  
upwards and downwards, so the m ean bubble velo city is not affected much by this bias. 
At Ug=2 cm /s all bubbles m oved upwards (F igure 5-7a), and the peak in the bubble 
velocity distribution was thin and sharp. At  Ug>8 cm /s, the bubble velocity distributions 
at r/R=-0.9 and r/R=0.9 we re different. At r/R=-0.9, m ore bubbles moved downwards 
than upwards. At r/R=0.9, alm ost as m any bubbles m oved upwards as downwards. As a 
result, the radial profile of the m ean bubble velocity was not symmetric at z/D=5.1 and 
the m ean bubble velocity at r/R=-0.9 was s maller than that at r/R=0.9 (Figure 5-6a). 
When Ug increas ed from 8 cm /s to 14 cm /s (i.e ., in th e tran sition  flow regime) the m ean 
velocity of bubbles m oving upwards increased greatly (from  9.45 to 20.9cm /s at r/R=-0.9 
and from  12.4 to 28.3cm /s at r/R=0.9)  while that of bubbles m oving downwa rds 
increased mildly in m agnitude (from –33.8 to -39.1cm /s at r/R=-0.9 and –28.2 to -
34.6cm /s at r/R=0.9). T his is because large bubbles, which have high  velocity, a rose in 
the trans ition flow regim e (this is evident from  an increase in the num ber of bubbles of 
high velocity in the bubble velo city distributions at Ug=8 cm /s and 14 cm /s, Figures 5-8b 
and 5-8c) and assem bled in the central str eam of the column. Th e velocity of bubbles 
moving downwards in the wall zone increase d mainly due to the e nhancem ent of  the 
liquid recirculation caused by the appearance  of large bubbles in the central stream. 
Hence, the velocity of bubbles moving upwards jum ped and of bubbles m oving  122
downwards incre ases on ly mildly in  the tran sition flow regim e. In churn-turbulent flow, 
at Ug>14cm/s, the percentage of bubbles m oving downwards increase d slowly with Ug 
in the wall z one.

The bubble velocity distributions in the center of th e bubble colum n (r/R=0, z/D= 5.1) at 
different Ug are shown in Figure 5-8. In c ontrast to the wall zone, m ost bubbles m ove 
upwards in the colum n center. The percen tage of bubbles m oving downwards increased 
with Ug, but even at Ug as high as 60cm /s, only a sm all percentage of bubbles m oved 
downwards in the colum n center. Bubbles moving downwards in the column center m ay 
be small bubbles that exist in the wakes of la rge bubbles, which m ay have negative 
velocity due to liquid recirculation in the wa kes. In churn-turbulent flow, the num ber of 
large bubbles increases with Ug, s o ther e are more bubbles m oving downwards being 
detected by the four-point probe. T he bubble ve locity distribution in the colum n center 
spreads m ore widely with inc reased  Ug, and th e magnitude of  the m ean veloc ity of  
bubbles m oving upwards is m uch larger than that of bubbles moving downwards.

               (r/R=0, z /D=5.1, Sparger #2) 
 
The bubble chord length distributio ns obtained by the four-point  optical probe at different 
gas velocities in the wall zone (r/R=-0.9; th e shape of bubble chord le ngth distributions at 
r/R=0.9 are sim ilar to that at r/R=-0.9.) a nd in the center (r/R=0) of the bubble colum n are 
displayed in Figure 5-9. At colum n center (r/R=0), the num ber of the bubbles used for the 
calculation of the bubble c hord length distribution is over 10,000 at Ug ≥8 cm /s and about 
4,000 at Ug =2cm /s. In the wall region (r /R=-0.9), the number is  over 5,000 and about 
4,000, respectively. This large num ber of the bubbles available for the derivation of the 
bubble chord length distribution and m ean bubbl e chord length m akes the results reliable. 
It can be seen that in th e colum n center the bubble chord length distribution spreads 
wider, and the probability for both s mall and la rge chord  lengths in creases with  increased 
Ug (Figure 5-9a). In the wa ll zone (Figure 5-9b), the sh ape of the bubble chord length 
distribution does not change much with Ug when Ug ≥ 8 cm /s. The probability of sm all 
bubble chord length increases with Ug, while that of large bubble chord length does not 
change m uch with Ug. This is also  becau se th e large bub bles pass th rough the b ubble 
colum n in the core of the central bubble stream, as described by Che n, Reese and Fan 
(1994), and seldom  move into the wall zone, while sm all bubbles tend to enter the wall 
zone and m ove with the downwards liquid flow.

The m ean bubble chord length and the standa rd deviation of the bubble chord length 
distributions are plotted in Fi gure 5-10. The error bar for th e mean bubble chord length is 
also shown. It can be seen that the m ean and standard deviation of the bubble chord 
length distribution in the colum n center are al most identica l to those in the wall zon e at 
Ug=2 c m/s, where the central stream of larg e bubbles does not exist, and at Ug=8 cm /s, 
where the liquid recirculation starts, however, the num ber of large bubbles in the central 
stream  is still sm all. W hen Ug ≥ 14 cm /s, the mean and stan dard deviation of the bubble 
chord length  distribu tion in th e column center are m uch larg er than thos e in the wall zone 
due to the assem bly of large bubbles in the central bubble st ream . In the colum n center,  
the m ean bubble chord length increases with Ug when Ug ≤ 30cm /s and decreases 
slightly with Ug when  Ug ≥ 30 c m/s (Figure 5-10a); the standard deviation increases 
quickly between Ug = 8 c m/s and Ug = 30 c m/s and decrea ses sligh tly with Ug when Ug 
≥ 30 cm /s. This is bec ause in the tran sition f low regim e and c hurn-turbulent flow regim e, 
bubbles break and coalesce, and the num ber of both large and sm all bubbles increases 
and the bubble size distribution spreads wi der than the relativel y uniform  bubble size 
distribution in bubbly flow. In th e churn-turbulent flow regim e the increase in the number  
of small bubbles is faster than that of larg e bubbles, so the m ean bubble chord length  126
decreases slightly with U g. In the wall zone, the m ean bubble chord length in creases with 
Ug when Ug ≤ 8cm /s and decreases som ewhat with Ug when Ug ≥ 8 cm/ s. The st andar d 
deviation keeps increasing with Ug in the range  Ug=2 cm /s to 60 cm /s, but the  rate of 
increase is much slower than that in the column center. Th is is also th e consequen ce of 
the fact that the large bubbles  gather in the colu mn center, and m ainly sm all bubbles exist 
in the wall z one of  the c olumn.

Figure 5-11 shows the bubble velocity distribu tion and bubble chord length distribution at 
different radial positions in the bubble colum n (at radial positions r/R=0, -0.3, -0.6 and -
0.9 only, the shape of the bubble veloc ity distribution and bubble chord length 
distribution at symm etric radial positions, r/R=0.3, 0.6 and 0.9,  are alike).  It can  be seen 
from  Figure 5-11a that the percentage of bubbles m oving downwards increases from the 
colum n center to the wall zone ; in the core of the colum n the change is slow, and bubbles 
moving upwards are in the m ajority, while in the wall zone bubbles m oving downwards  
predom inate. Since bubbles m ove with the li quid flow, this phenom enon is corroborated 
by research findings on liquid recirculati on in bubble colum ns, which shows that the  127
transition from  upflow t o downflow for the liq uid recirculation happe ns at r/R=0.6~0.7 
(Boon Cheng Ong, 2003). As shown in Figure 5-11b, the bubble chord length 
distributions in the core of  the column are alike in sh ape. A sudden change happens 
within the w all zone where the percentage of sm all bubble ch ord lengths increases greatly 
because m ainly sm all bubbles ex ist in the wa ll zone of th e colu mn. Hence, it can be 
concluded that in chu rn-turbu lent f low in the c ore of  the c olumn (r/R<0.6) the sha pe of 
the bubble velocity and bubble chord length distri butions are alike, while in the wall zone 
they are very different from  those in the core of the colum n.

Figure 5-12 shows the rela tionship between the bubble velocity and the bubble chord 
length at th e center of the co lumn at differe nt Ug. It should be noted that the bubble 
velocity is the sum  of the liquid velocity and the bubble’s slip velocity since bubbles 
move with the liquid flow in bubble colum ns. In other words, bubble size is not the only 
factor that affects the bubble velocity. In chur n-turbulent flow, it is not even the decisive 
factor in som e cases, e.g. m any small bubbles have as high velocity as large bubbles 
(Figure 5-12c and d) because th ey exist in the wa ke of large bubbles and m ove with the 
large bubbles. As expected, th e bubble velocity roughly increases with bubble size in  128
bubbly flow and it is m uch higher in churn-tu rbulent flow than in bubbly flow.  In churn-
turbulent flow, the velocity of a portion of  small bubbles is as high as large bubbles 
(Figure 5-1 2d). This is because m any sm all bubbles ex ist in the wake of large bub bles 
and hence move with the large bubbles. In a few cases, large bubbles have relatively low 
velocity. The possible reason is  that large bubbles turn to vibrate seriously during 
move ment, if the probe hits the part of a large bubble that is vibrating in the opposite 
direction of the bubble velocity, th en the ve locity detected  by the probe will be much 
lower than the real velocity of the bubble. Besides, the fl ow field in bu bble colum ns is 
very com plicated and it affects the bubble velo city seriously. The sim ultaneous existence 
of down flow liquid stream  may also decr ease the velocity of som e large bubbles.

5.4  The Effect of Pressure 
 
Pressure is one of the key operating vari ables that affects th e hydrodynam ics in bubble  
colum ns. To investigate the pressure eff ect, bubble properties at 0.1MPa, 0.4MPa and 
1.0MPa and at Ug=30cm/s were determ ined in  this study. It can be seen from  Figure 5-13 
that both gas holdup and specific interfacial area increase greatly wi th pressure in the 
range of 0.1MPa to 1.0 MPa at Ug=30cm /s, and the increase is alm ost uniform  across the 
colum n diam eter. Furtherm ore, the increases in gas holdup  and specific interfacial area 
when pressu re increases  from  0.1 MPa to 0.4 MPa are m uch larger th an when pressure 
increases from  0.4 MPa to 1.0  MPa, i.e.,  the e ffect of pres sure is weak when pres sure 
increases from  0.4 MPa to 1.0 MPa, especially  for the spe cific inte rfacial area (Figure 5-
13b).

                     (Sparger #3, 30 cm/s, z /D = 5.1) 
 
In the studies conducted by LaNauze and Ha rris (1974) and Fan et al. (1999), it was 
shown that with increasing pre ssure, sm aller and m ore freque nt bubbles are form ed at the 
gas sparge r, which is attr ibuted to the  increased contribution of th e gas mom entum to the 
bubble formation process. According to the study  by Igodawa et al. ( 1987), for sparger #3 
and at Ug=30 c m/s, the bubble form ation is in bubbling regim e at 0.1MPa and it is in 
jetting regim e at 0.4 and 1.0 MPa (Boon Che ng Ong, 2003). In the jetting regim e, it was 
observed that sm aller and m ore fre quent bubbl es are form ed at a single orifice (Igodawa 
et al., 1987). This was proved by the bubble fre quency in the sparger zone of the bubble 
colum n obtained by the f our-point probe at di fferent pressures, as shown in Figure 5-14a. 
It can be seen from  Figure 5-14 that the bubble frequency in creases greatly with pressure 
in the sparger zone and even beyond the sparger zone at z/D=5.1.

Figure 5-14.  Pressure Effect on Bubble Frequency (Sparger #3, 30 cm/s) 
 
In the core of the column, the m ean bubble velo city also increases w ith pressure, but this  
increase is not as prom inent as that of gas holdup and specific interfacial area (F igure 5-
15). This is because on one hand the bubble size decreases with pressure; on the other 
hand, liquid recirculation is enhanced at  high pressure (Boon Cheng Ong, 2003). These 
two factors have opposite effects on the m ean bubble velocity: the former decreases the 
bubble velo city, becau se sm all bubbles have lo wer term inal velocity th an large bub bles; 
the later increases the bubble velocity, since bubbles m ove with the liquid flow. These 
two factors som ewhat counteract each other, so  that the net effect of pr essure on mean 
bubble velocity is weak. In the wall zone the downward m ovement of bubbles  was 
obviously enhanced with the p ressure. This is because th e enhancem ent of the liquid  
recirculation dom inates in the wall zone sin ce there are no large bubbles there, thus the 
decrease of the bubble si ze with pressure was not as signi ficant as in the core of  the 
colum n. In short, at higher pressure the mean bubble velocity profile becom es more  
parabolic.

It can be seen from  Figure 5-16a that pr essure does not affect  the bubble velocity 
distribution very m uch in the colum n center. To a sm all extent, the percentage of bubbles  
moving downwards decreases with pressure , but the shape of the bubble velocity 
distribution is es sentially identica l. The situ ation is d ifferent in  the wa ll zone, as  shown in 
Figure 5-16b and 5-17c. In the wall zone, at  r/R=-0.9 the percen tage of bubbles that 
moved downwards increased gr eatly with p ressure, so  that th e shap e of the bub ble 
velocity distribution changed notably with pr essure. However, at r/R=0. 9 the chang e of 
the shape of the bubble velocity distribution w ith pressure is not obvious. It is also 
noticed that in the colum n center the m ean velocity of bubbles m oving upwards increases 
somewhat with pressu re, while that of  bubbles m oving downwar ds decreases. The 
opposite trend occurs in the wall zone. This m eans that the liquid recirculation is 
enhanced by pressure since bubbles m ove w ith the liquid flow in bubble colum ns. The 
same conclusion was reached in CARPT expe riments at the sam e conditions by Boon 
Cheng Ong (2003) and in  the literature (Jiang et al. , 1995; F an et al., 1999; Chen et al. , 
1999b). This conclusion is in line with the anal ysis of the effect of pressure on the m ean 
bubble velocity profiles reviewed before.

As shown in Figure 5-17, the shape of the bubble chord length distribution changes 
somewhat with pressure and the m ean bubble chord length decreases in both the wall 
zone and th e colum n center when the pressure  changes from 0.1 MPa to 0.4 MPa. It is 
expected that the bubble size de creases with pressure (Fan et al. , 1999; Lin, Tsuchiya and 
Fan, 1998). Nevertheless, at pressure higher than 0.4 MPa, the m ean bubble chord length 
stays alm ost iden tical an d in som e cases in creases slightly with pr essure. One explanation  
might be that when the num ber of large bubbl es decreases with pressure, the num ber of  134
small bubbles in the wake of large bubbles also decreases. Fu rtherm ore, as expected, the 
mean bubble chord length in the colum n center is  much larger than that in the wall zone,  
due to the assem bly of la rge bubbles in the column center.

5.5  The Effect of Spargers 
 
It has been reported that the configuration of  the sparger,  e.g., the num ber and size of the 
orifices, af fects the generation of bubbl es and subsequently may affect the 
hydrodynamics in bubble colum ns (LaNauze and Harris, 1974; Tsuge and Hibino, 1983; 
Idogawa et al. , 1987; Tsuge et al. , 1992; Yoo et al. , 1998; Snabre and Magnifotcham,  
1998; Terasaka et al. , 1999; Hsu et al. , 2000). As shown in Figur e 5-2 and detailed in 
Table 5-2, three spargers were used in th is study: a cross spar ger (sparger #1), a 
perforated plate w ith 0.15% open area (sparg er #2), and a perforat ed plate with 1. 0% 
open area (sparger #3). 
 
It was found that, in the spar ger zone (z/D=1.7),  the bubble frequency increased in the 
order of sparger #1, sparger #3, and sparger #2, as shown in Figure 5-18. Sparger #1 and 
sparger #3, which are totally different in  their hole numbers, hole sizes, and hole  
distributions, generate bubbles of relatively si milar properties, e.g., bubble frequency, etc.

                 Holdup (0.1MPa, 30 cm/s, z /D = 1.7 , r/R=0) 
 
Figure 5-19 shows the bubble ch ord length distributions in the column center in the 
sparger zon e (z/D=1.7) for the thre e spargers . The distributions for sparger #1 and #3 are  
alike, except sparger #3 produced an addi tional peak at small values of bubble chord 
length. The bubble chord length distributi on for sparger #2 has a higher probability 
density at sm all values of chord length. The m ean bubble chord length and standard 
deviation of the bubble chord length distributio ns decreases in the order of sparger #1,  
sparger #3, and sparger #2 (Fi gure 5-19b). Consequently, the local gas holdup at z/D =1.7 
incre ases in  the sam e order, i.e., sp arger #2 produced the highest  local gas holdup and  137
sparger #1 and #3 gave almost the same gas holdup, as shown in Figure 5-19c. Some 
correlations have been developed for the es timation of the initia l bubble size at the 
sparger (Ellenberger and Krishna, 1994; Leibson et al. , 1956; Wallis, 1969). The 
estimated initial bubble sizes based on these predictions ar e listed in Table 5-4 (Boon 
Cheng Ong, 2003). Obviously the initial bubble size by the pr ediction of Ellenberger and 
Krishna (1994) is too large. The in itial bubble sizes predicted by Leibson et al.  (1956) 
and Wallis (1969) are of the same order of  magnitude as the mean bubble chord length 
obtained by the four-point probe. Although th e bubble size increases with axial position 
in the sparger zone due to bubble coalescen ce so that the bubble size at the measuring 
position of the probe (z/D=1.7) is larger than  at the sparger, th e bubble size predicted by 
the proposition of Wallis (1969) for sparger #2 and #3 still seems to be too small. 
Furthermore, the initial bubble size increases in the order of  sparger#1, sparger#2 and 
sparger#3 according to th e prediction of Leibson et al.  (1956), while the mean bubble 
chord length obtained by the probe (r/R=0) incr eases in the order of sparger#2, sparger#3 
and sparger#1. Hence, the initial bubble size estimated by these predictions does not fit the experimental results in this study.

The bubble velocity distributions in the sparge r zone for different spargers are shown in 
Figure 5-20. It was found that sparger #1 and sparger #3 generated approximately the 
same bubble velocity distribution at different ra dial positions in the sparger zone (Figure 
5-20a, 5-23b and 5-23c). Sparger #2 genera ted more bubbles moving downwards in the 
wall zone, especially at r/R=-0.9 (Figure 5-20b). This is also clear from the radial profiles  138
of the m ean bubble velocity for different sp argers (Figure 5-20d), where it can be seen 
that, for the three spargers used, the m ean bubbl e velocity for sparger #2 is the sm allest in 
the wall zon e.

Sparger #2 also produced a highe r specific interfacial area in  the sparg er zone than  the 
other two spargers, as shown in Figure 5-21. Th is is in agree ment with the radia l profiles 
of the local gas holdup (Figure 5-19c) and bubble frequency (Figur e 5-18), due to the 
correlation o f these three variab les.

Earlier by CT and CARPT experiments Boon Cheng Ong (2003) found that deep in the  
churn-turbulent flow regim e (Ug≥30cm /s) at atmospheric p ressure th ere are sm all effects  
of the distributor on the ra dial gas holdup profile and liqui d recirculation in the fully 
developed region (z/D ≥5.5). The sparger effect on bu bble p roperties in the fully 
developed region obtained by the four-point probe is shown in Figure 5-22. It can be seen 
that at atm ospheric pressure, the sparger eff ect on the radial profile of gas holdup, bubble 
frequency, m ean bubbl e velocity, and specific interfacial area is sm all at z/D=5.1. The 
exception is noted in the wall zone for m ean bubble velocity and m ay be caused by the 
existence of  coherent structures (Groen et al., 1996), which m akes the flow field in the 
wall zone asymm etric and causes frequent change s in the flow direction. In other words, 
the radial profiles of the bubble frequency, the m ean bubbl e velocity , and the specific 
interfacial area for the th ree spargers follow the sam e rule as the gas holdup profiles.  140

5.6  The Effect of Axial Position 
 
In churn-turbulent flow, in th e near sparger region, the bubb le size continuously changes  
with respect to dist ance from  the sparger and finally attains the equilibrium  bubble size 
distribution, which is decided by the bala nce between bubble breakup and coalescence in 
bubble columns. The region wher e the bubble size changes is called the sparger region. 
The height of the sparger region depends on the configuration of the colum n and the  
sparger, the properties of th e liquid and gas phase, and th e operating conditions. It was   141
reported that the height of the sparger region in bubble colum ns is in the range of 1 ≤ z/D 
≤ 5 (Joshi et al., 1998). On the other hand, Shollenberger et al. (1997) reported sparger  
effect only up to 2.5 diam eter heights in churn-turbulent flow. Beyond the sparger region,  
the gas holdup profile does not  change with axial position in the bubble colum n. Besides 
the gas holdup profiles, the ch anges in other bubble propertie s with axial position were 
also investigated in this study. 
 
At high pressure, it is observed that the gas holdu p incre ases with the axial position  in the  
colum n (Figure 5-23b and c), while at atm ospheric pressure, when the other conditions 
are the same, the effect of axial positi on on the gas holdup profile was not obvious 
(Figure 5 -23a). This r esult at high pressure is contrary to the findings at Sandia National 
Laboratory (Shollenberger, Torczynski and George, 2002). However,  the liquid syste m 
used in th eir research was drakeoil, n ot water.

                (Sparger #3, Ug=30 cm/s) 
 
The reason for the increase in the gas  holdup with the axial p osition at high pressure ca n 
be found by analyzing the holdup of larg e bubbles and sm all bubbles in the colum n 
center, as shown in Figure 5- 24. The classification of bubbles into larg e and sm all ones is 
explain ed in deta il later  in Sec tion 5.8. It can be seen that  at atmospher ic pressure t he 
small bubble holdup decreases with  axial position in the sparger zone and arrives at a 
constant value at z/D>5.1, while the large bubble holdup increases in the sparger zone 
and reach es its asym ptotic value in the fully developed zone. This is  because bu bble 
coales cence leads  to a decrea se in the num ber of s mall bu bbles and  an increase in the 
number of l arge bubbles in the fully devel oped region. At high pressure, the sm all bubble 
holdup does  not change m uch with the ax ial position,  while th e large bubble ho ldup 
keeps inc reasing in th e axial direction. 
 
The reason  for this difference between atm ospheric pressure and high pressures is 
unknown. One possibility is that an increase in pressure causes a decrease in the bubble 
size, and sm aller bubbles are m ore stable th an large bubbles (Fan , 1999) at the free 
surface. Hence, at high  pressures b ubbles accu mulate in th e upper zone of the colum n, 
leading  to an increase in gas holdu p in th e axial direction. The eff ect of pressure on  143
bubble coalescence and breakage ha s not been reported in the li terature. As shown later, 
the exam ination of the change of bubble fr equency along the axial direction of the  
colum n supports th is explanation.

At atm ospheric pressure bubble frequency was higher in the sparger zone than in the 
upper zone of the column for the sparger us ed (Figure 5-25a). Th is supports the notion 
that bubble coalescence leads to a decrease  in the number of s mall bubbles and an  144
increase in the num ber of large bubbles at at mospheric pressure. At high pressures, the 
opposite trend is true: the bubble frequency is lo wer in the sparger zone than in the upper 
zone of the colum n (Figure 5-25b and 5-30c). This fact supports th e explanation for an 
increase in gas holdup in the axial direction at high pressure, i.e., the accum ulation of 
bubbles in the upper zone of the colum n.

Figure 5-26 shows the bubble c hord length distributions an d mean bubble chord lengths 
at different pressures in the column cen ter. The shape of the bubble chord length 
distributions is alike at diffe rent axial positions at high pressures (Figure 5-26a). T he 
mean bubbl e chord length (Figure 5-26b) decr eases slightly with  axial position at 
atmospheric pressure, an d it increas es with axial position at 0.4 MPa and 1.0 MPa, which 
implies the enhancem ent of bubble coalescence due to the accum ulation of bubbles in the 
upper zone of the column at high pressure . Furtherm ore, the m ean bubble chord length 
decreases as  pressure in creas es from 0.1 MP a to 0.4 MPa, as expected, but it does not 
change m uch at pressure highe r than 0.4 MPa (Figure 5-26b).

In bubbly flow and transition flow, the changes in  the rad ial profile of specific in terfacial 
area with ax ial pos ition, as illustrate d in Fi gure 5-27a, follow the sam e patte rn as th e gas 
holdup profile, since they are correlated. At high pressure , the specific interfacial area 
increased with axial position (Figure 5-27b and 5-26c), which was contrary to the 
situation at atm ospheric pressure (F igure 5- 27a). This is due to the obvious increase in 
the gas holdup (Figure 5-23) in the axial direction at high p ressure.

For the operating conditions em ploye d in this study, the m ean bubble velocity profile did 
not change m uch with a xial pos ition, except at low gas velo city (U g =2 cm /s, shown in 
Figure 5-28). At Ug=2 cm /s the m ean bubble velocity in the lowe r zone of the bubble 
colum n (z/D=1.7) was higher than that in the upper zone. This wa s possibly due to the  
large  initial m omentum  of the bub bles jettin g from  the sp arger a nd the lack of liquid 
recirculation  at low gas velocity. T his was not true when Ug ≥ 8 cm /s, i.e., in the  
transition and churn-turbulent region, where the m ean bubble ve locity in the core of the  147
colum n did not change much with axial posi tion. The situ ation was th e sam e at h igh 
pressure and for the other spargers. This m eans that in the transition and  churn-turbu lent 
regim e the m ean bubbl e velocity profile devel oped very fast in the axial direction; in 
other words, the sparger zone for the m ean bubble velocity profile was sm all. In the wall 
zone, the m ean bubble velocity was different at different axial positions in both bubbly 
flow and churn-turbulent flow. This change wa s due to the c omplexity o f the f low field, 
i.e., the flow direction changed with tim e and the exis tence of flow cells (Gro en et al., 
1996).

probe, the S auter m ean bubble diameter, d s, can  be calculated w ith Equ ation (2-1 ). As 
discussed in Section 4.2, Equation (2-1) is accurate only for spheri cal bubbles. In bubble 
colum ns, although m ost bubbles are not spherical, the S auter m ean bubble diam eter 
obtained with Equation (2-1) is st ill valuable for q ualitative an alysis.  Actu ally it is wid ely 
used as a description of the m agnitude of  bubble size in bubble columns. Hence, this  148
param eter was also in vestig ated in this  study. The rad ial profiles  of the Sau ter m ean 
bubble diam eter at different gas velocities ar e shown in Figure 5-29. At Ug=2 c m/s, the 
radial profile of d s is fl at, which is reasonable fo r bubbly flow. At Ug=8 cm /s and 14 
cm/s, the ra dial p rofile of ds is roughly flat. At  higher gas velocity, the profile becom es 
parabolic du e to an  increase in d s in the co lumn center and  a decrease in the wall zone. 
This is true for churn-turbulent flow where large bubbles assem ble in the central strea m. 
It is also observed from Figure 5-29 that , unlike the radial pr ofiles of gas holdup and 
specific interfacial area shown be fore, the radial profile of d s is ra ther irregula r, i.e.,  the 
varia tion is large  so that the profile is not sm ooth. This lack  of sm oothness of the radial 
profile indicates that the error in the Sa uter m ean bubble diam eter obtained by Equation 
(2-1) is large and is m ost likely due to different bubbl e shape in various regions.

As expected, the radial profile  of the Sauter m ean bubble diam eter becom es flat at high 
pressure, and the value of d s decreases greatly  com pared to the value at atm ospheric 
pressure (Figure 5-30). Furtherm ore, d s does not change much as the pressure changes   149
from  0.4 MPa to 1.0 MPa. This is consis tent to the res ults for bubble chord length 
distribution as shown in Figure 5-26b. The above analysis indi cates th at while th e Sauter 
mean bubble diam eter is a valuable param eter to qualitatively describe the bubble size in 
bubble columns, it is subj ect to large errors.

5.8  The Bubble Siz e Distribution 
 
Krishna, Wilkinson and van Dierendonck (1 991) inferred from  gas disengagem ent 
experim ents that there are both large and s mall bubbles in churn-turbulent flow. They 
proposed that beyond a certain regim e tran sition velocity, the small bubble holdup is 
constant and the large bubble ho ldup keeps increasing with the gas velocity, as illustrated 
in Figure 5-31. Such a bim odal bubble size dist ribution is a characteristic feature of the 
churn-turbulent flow regim e, they claim ed. 
  150
However, Deshpande, D inkar and Joshi (1995) provided another explanation for the gas 
disengagem ent experimental resu lts. They thought that the initi al faster disengagem ent is 
due to internal liquid circula tion and not due to the presence  of very large bubbles, and, 
hence, they claim ed that the bim odal bubble si ze distribution is not necessarily proven by 
the results of gas disengagem ent experim ents. Since the bubble si ze distribution is 
important in m odeling, design and scaleup of bubble colum ns, this m ust be clarified. To 
address this, the tim e based bubble chord lengt h distribution, the la rge bubble holdup, and 
small bubble holdup obtained by the four- point probe were investigated. 
 
 
Figure 5-31.  Gas Holdup Model in Bubble Columns Proposed by 
                       Krishna, Wilkinson, and van Dierendonck (1991) 
 
It was n ecessary to classify bubbles into large an d sm all base d on an arbitrary criterio n as 
to how long the probe tip resides in the bubble as indicated in Figure 5-32. At Ug=2c m/s, 
bubbly flow prevails in the co lumn and there are few large bubbles. It can be seen in 
Figure 5-32 that the pdf of the bubble chord length ends at about  t=0.02s at Ug=2 cm /s in  151
the cen ter o f the colum n at r/R=0, and actuall y this is true  at all th e radial positio ns. 
Hence, the criterion for distinguishing large and s mall bubbles is set to be t=0.02s. Based 
on this criterion, if the tim e interval that th e probe tip spends in a bubble is larger than t =  
0.02s, the bubble is classified as a large bubb le; otherwise it is classified as a sm all 
bubble.

bubbles to the gas holdup, wh ich can be calculated as:

The sm all bubble holdup can be obtained in the sa me way. It is shown in Figure 5-33 that 
in the core of the column (r/R=0, r/R=-0.6) both the sm all bubble holdup and the large 
bubble holdup increase with Ug in churn- turbulent flow, and the sm all bubble holdup 
increases faster. In the wall zone, the large bubble holdup in churn turbulent flow is low  152
and stays almost constant with an increase in Ug. Hence, the gas holdup m odel proposed 
by Krishna, W ilkinson, and van Dierendonck (1991) as shown in Figure 5-31 does not 
quite ho ld.

Figure 5-33.  Local Gas Holdup Obtained by the Probe 
 
Figure 5-34 shows the contribution to the local  gas holdup of the tim e intervals that the 
probe’s central tip spends in bubbles. This  is the volume based bubble chord length 
distribution in term s of tim e. It can be s een that the contributi on of large bubble chord 
lengths to the local gas holdup increases with Ug, and becom es considerable at high Ug  153
in the core of the column (Figure 5-34a). In the wall zo ne, the large bubble holdup does 
not change much with Ug and is negligible even at Ug=60 cm /s (Figure 5-34b). Hence, it 
can be concluded that the volum e based bubble si ze distribution is not bimodal. Rather, it 
is sing le modal in the ra nge of  opera ting cond itions em ployed.

Figure 5-34.  Time Based Bubbl e Chord Length Distribution 
 
The probe can detect only the bubble chord length  distribution, and this is different fr om 
the bubble size distribution. For example, if th e probe tip hits near the edge of a large 
bubble, a s mall chord length, which is possib ly sm aller th an 0.02s, will be detected and 
this bubble will be classifi ed as a “sm all” bubble accord ing to the above criterion. 
However, the qualitative result obtained by the probe will not ch ange due to the 
overwhelm ing num ber of s mall bubbles to larg e bubbles (Figure 5-32). Furthermore, it 
was found that a sm all change in this crite rion does not change the shape of the gas 
holdup profiles shown in Figure 5-33. Hence, it is reasonabl e to expect that the bubble 
size distribution is also single m odal in the range of operating conditi ons employed in this 
study, which cover both bubbly fl ow and churn-turbulent flow . A sim ulation as shown in 
Appendix D.4 also proves this. 
  154
The tim e based bubble chord length distribut ion and large and sm all bubble holdups at 
high pressure are shown in Figure 5-35. At  high pressure the sm all bubbles contribute 
much m ore to the gas holdup than the large bubbles, and the small bubble holdup 
increases obviously with pressure, w hile th e large bubble holdup decreas es with pressure 
(Figure 5-35b). This is in lin e with the fact that the bubble size decreases with pressure. 
Hence, if the bubble size distri bution is not bim odal at atm ospheric pressure, neither is it 
at high pres sure at the sam e gas velocity, due to the reduc tion of the num ber of large 
bubbles.

As explained before, only when a bubble hits all the four tips of the probe, the bubble  
velocity and the bubble chord length can be obtained. The volum e bas ed bubble chord 
length distribution of these m easured bubbles  is a good analogue of that for the whole 
bubble population due to the fact  that the bubbles hit the pr obe random ly. Som e examples 
of the volume based bubble chor d length distribution obtained by this m eans are sho wn in 
Figure 5-36. Actually Figure 5- 36 shows the percentage of  the sum  of the bubble chord 
lengths pierced by the probe’s central tip in ea ch chord leng th class to the sum  of all the  
bubble chord lengths pierced by the probe’s cen tral tip obtained by the four-point probe.   155
The shape of the distribution in Figure 5-36 is the same as the volume based bubble chord 
length distribution but in different scale. Actually the distribution in Figure 5-36 can be 
transferred to the volume based bubble chor d length distribution can be obtained by 
multiplying the volume based local gas holdup (refer to Equation 4-10). However, the 
probe can only measure the time based gas holdup and the volume-based local gas holdup is unknown as explained in Section 4.3. 
 
It can be seen that the volume based bubble chord length distributions have the same shape as time based bubble chord length dist ributions (Figure 5-34). Hence, the above 
analysis based on time based bubble chord leng th distribution is valid for volume based 
bubble size distribution. Therefor e, while all the bubbl es that hit the cen tral tip of the 
four-point probe contribute to the local ga s holdup, the volume ba sed bubble chord length 
distribution obtained by the probe (Figure 5-36) utilizes only those bubbles whose velocity can be determined by the probe. On  the other hand, the time based bubble chord 
length distribution utilizes th e whole bubble population because every time interval that 
the probe’s central tip spends in a bubble is  employed in the derivation of the time based 
bubble chord length distribution. As described above, both of these distributions point to 
the same conclusion that the bubble size distri bution is single modal in the range of 
operating conditions employed in this study.

5.9  The Mean Gas-Liq uid Slip Velocity 
 
The local gas-liquid slip velocity is defined as the relative velocity between the bu bble 
and the surrounding liquid phase. This paramete r is im portant in Computational Fluid 
Dyna mics (CFD). Whe n a bubble is m oving in a n infinite liquid phase, the slip velocity is 
equal to the bubble’s term inal rise veloci ty. In bubble colum ns, in the hom ogene ous 
regim e, the slip velocity is le ss than or equal to the bubble’ s term inal velocity, while in 
the hete rogeneous regim e, the slip ve locity is larger than or eq ual to the bu bble’s term inal 
velocity (Fan and Tsuchiya, 1990). 
 
By com bining the local m ean bubble velocity obtained  by the four-point probe, bv, and 
the loc al mean liqu id velocity, lv, obtained by C ARPT (Boon Cheng Ong, 2003), the 
local m ean gas-liquid slip velocity can be obtained as l b s v v v−= . It is shown in Figure 
5-37 that the bubble slip velocity  increases from  the colum n center towards the wall zone, 
and it reaches the m aximum  at r/R=0.6 at all the operating c onditions studied. In the wall 
zone, i.e., at r/R=0.9, th e slip  veloc ity is m uch sm aller than in the co re of the co lumn. As 
shown before in this study the bubble size in the wall zone is sm aller than that in the core   157
of the column, and large bubbles  usually have larger slip velocity than sm all bubbles. 
However, th is is contr ary to the ob servation th at the slip ve locity in creases with r/R, since 
large bubbles tend to assem ble in the central stream . Hence, in addition to the bubble 
size, there must be som e other factors th at affect the slip  velocity, which, unf ortunately,  
are unclear at presen t. 
 
Figure 5-37a shows that the radial  profiles of  the mean slip velocity f or the th ree spargers 
used in this study are alm ost identical. Figure 5-37b shows that, for sparger #2 at  
Ug=30cm /s and 45 cm /s, the  slip ve locity  at di fferent rad ial position s is identic al. Finally 
Figure 5-37c shows that the slip  velocity obviously decreases with pressure. This is in 
accord with the fact th at the bubbl e size decreases with pressu re.

point optical probe are valuable for CFD st udies. However, such studies are beyond the 
scope of this  study and will b e followed up elsew here.  159
 
Chapter 6  Conclusions and Future Work 
 
The following conclusions can be derived from this study: 
 
1. Two-point probes produce questionable results in systems having complex 
hydrodynamics, such as bubble columns, especially  in transition and churn-turbulent flow 
regime. 
 
2. The four-point optical probe and the new da ta processing algorithm is a practical tool 
for investigating bubble properties in bubbl e columns. By validation against video 
imaging, it was proved that the bubble velo city distribution, bubble chord length 
distribution, local gas holdup, and specific interfaci al area obtained by the new four-point 
optical probe algorithm are reliable. Difficultie s exist in the measurements of bubbles of 
very low velocity approximating to zero. 
 
3. The four-point optical probe performed well both in bubbly flow and in highly churn-
turbulent flow at superficial gas velocity up to 60 cm/s and pressure up to 1.0 MPa. 
Bubble properties at these condi tions in a 6.4” bubble column were measured for the first 
time, which are valuable for CFD validation and for development of engineering models. 
 
4. Some new findings about bubble pr operties in bubble columns are: 
 
(1). In bubbly flow, the radial profiles of  specific interfacial area, bubble frequency, 
and mean bubble velocity are all flat. With an increase in superficial gas 
velocity, Ug, these profiles became more parabolic. In the column center, the 
bubble chord length distributi on spreads wider with an increase in Ug. The mean 
bubble chord length increases with Ug until it is in deep churn-turbulent flow 
and then remains almost id entical with Ug. In the wall region, the bubble chord 
length distribution does not change mu ch with Ug. The mean bubble chord  160
length in the wall region is much smaller than that in the column center, and it 
increases mildly with Ug between th e bubbly flow and the transition flow 
regime, then decrease slightly with Ug. 
 
(2). At very low gas velocity, e.g. 2 cm/s, all bubbles move upwards in bubble 
column. In churn-turbulent flow (Ug> 8cm/s), some bubbles move downwards 
even in the column center. In the wall region, the number of bubbles moving 
downwards is equal to or even larger than that of bubbles moving upwards. The 
percentage of bubbles moving downwards increases slow ly with Ug in both the 
wall region and in the core of the column. In the wall region, the bubbles moving 
downwards are dragged down by the liquid, while in the core of the column the 
flow direction is generally upwards mo st of the time, and the bubbles moving 
downwards most likely come from the wa kes of large bubbles and large 3D flow 
structures. 
 
(3). In bubbly flow, the bubble velocity distributi on and bubble chord length 
distribution are alike at di fferent radial positions, in cluding the wall region. In 
churn-turbulent flow, in the core of the column the bubble velocity and chord 
length distributions are alike at different  radial position, but in the wall region 
they are very different from the core of the column. 
 
(4). With an increase in pressure, the globa l liquid recirculation is enhanced, and the 
radial profiles of specific interfacial  area, bubble frequency, and mean bubble 
velocity become more parabolic. The gas holdup increases with the axial position, 
possibly due to the accumulation of bubbles  at the upper zone of the column at 
high pressure. The pressure effect is str ong at 0.1 MPa, but it becomes weaker at 
pressures higher than 0.4 MPa. 
 
(5). Two of the three spargers used in this study, i.e. sparger#1 and sparger#3, 
generated similar bubble properties at the operating conditions employed,  161
although their configurations are totally different. Spar ger#2 generates somewhat 
different bubble properties than the other tw o spargers, though not to a significant 
extent. 
 
(6). In this study, the sparger effect disappears with an increase in the axial position in 
bubble column at z/D>5.1. However, at at mospheric pressure, the range of the 
sparger zone for the specific interfacial area is beyond z/D=5. Hence, the 
definition of the sparger zone based on gas holdup profiles may not apply to other 
bubble properties under some conditions. In other words, the range of the sparger zone for different bubble pr operties may be different. 
 
(7). The Sauter mean bubble diameter cannot be calculated without assumptions that 
are not met and it is subject to large errors. Qualitatively it can be used for 
comparison of “mean” bubble size at different conditions. 
 
(8). The bubble size distributions observed are single modal. Hence, the suggested 
bimodal bubble size distribution postulated  for churn-turbulent flow was not 
detected. 
 
(9). In this study, the mean gas-liquid slip velocity is almost identical for different 
spargers and at different superficial ga s velocities in churn-turbulent flow, it 
decreases with pressure, due to  a decrease in the bubble size. 
 
Suggested future work to fully utilize the pow er of the four-point optical probe technique: 
 
1. Use bubble properties data obtained by the f our-point optical probe for validation and 
refinement of CFD codes. 
 
2. Apply the four-point optical probe to a wi der range of operating conditions, such as the 
superficial gas velocity, pre ssure, column diameter, and spargers, etc., to expand the  162
bubble properties data base and get a be tter understanding of the hydrodynamics in 
bubble columns. Besides, apply the four-point optical probe to multiphase reactors other 
than bubble column, e.g., stirred tank reactors. 
 
3. Validate and apply the four- point probe in organic system s of industrial interest. In 
addition, apply the four-point probe at hi gh temperature and pressure higher than 1.0 
MPa. Exploit the potential of  the probe technique to de tect phase transition at 
supercritical conditions (see Appendix E). 
 
4. Apply the probe in slurry bubble columns to test the durability of the probe against the 
collision of the particles. In the cases th at the glass probe cannot stand long enough, e.g. 
systems with solid particles and high gas velocity, the plastic probe described in 
Appendix A should be used. 
 
5. Commercialize the four-point  probe technique to provide a tool which is simple and 
easy to use for the on site measurements of bubble properties, e.g. monitor the quality of 
the flow in multiphase reactors.  163
 
Appendix A  The Plastic Fiber Optical Probe 
 
An optical fiber probe made of plastic fi bers (Polymethyl Meta Acrylate) was also 
developed in this research according to the methods employed by Saito and Mudde 
(2001). The fabrication of the pl astic fiber probe is almost the same as that of the glass 
fiber probe, except that the tip of the pl astic fiber is cut into a wedge of 30o (Figure 
3.14a), which is the optimal angle determined by trail and error, instead of being made 
conical with a flame as in the case with the glass fiber. 
 
The plastic probe has the advantage over the glass probe that the size is small since there 
isn’t any protective cladding c over on it (the outer diameter of plastic fibers used is 
0.25mm, compared with 0.6mm for glass fibers). The smaller size of the probe reduces 
the disturbance of the probe to the flow field and make s the probe detects smaller 
bubbles. Furthermore, it is much more durab le than the glass fiber probe due to the 
flexibility of the plastic fiber.  Therefore, the plastic probe ma y be more suitable for use in 
slurry bubble columns where the glass probe may be broken by the particles in turbulent motion. 
 
It can be seen from Figure 3.14b that the outpu t voltage of the plastic fiber probe is low 
when the tip is in a bubble, an d it is high when the tip is  in the liquid phase, which is 
contrary to that of a glass fiber probe. This is determined by the characteristic of the 
photoelectric multiplier used. The pr ocessing of the responses is  the same as that for the 
glass optical probe. 
 
The disadvantages of the plas tic fiber probe are: (1) It cannot endure high temperature 
(the permanent usage temperature of the plastic fiber used is 75oC). (2) Some organic 
solution may do harm to the plastic fiber, this  limits its application in organic systems. 
And (3) the flexibility of the fiber makes it tremble in turbulent flow, this will cause  164
errors in m easurem ents. Moreover, the respons e of the plastic probe to a bubble is slower  
than that of a glass probe. This m akes the front edge of its response to a bubble more  
inclined than that of a glass probe (Figure A-1).

As shown in Figure 3-14, the xyz  coordinate sy stem  was transf ormed to the x’y’z’ system 
with z’-axis in the direction of the bubble ve locity vector. This transform ation can be 
accom plished with two rotations of the coordi nate axes in xyz system : rotate ang le ϕ 
around z axis and then rotate angle θ around y axis. Hence the rotation m atrix, A, can be 
obtained as (Glassner, 1990):

Appendix C  The Natural Frequency of the 
Optical Probe 
 
To check th e possib ility of re sonance of the glass optical probe in m ultiphase flow, the 
natural frequency of the probe was calculated. 
 
The for mula for the natural frequency is ( Condon and Odishaw, 1967 ): 
 
ρ=E
L21f           ( C-1) 
 
where f is the natural frequency, L  and ρ are the length and the density of the object 
(probe), and E is the Youngs m odulus of the m aterial of which the object (probe) is m ade. 
 
The physical properties of the glass optic al fiber used in this study are: L ≈1.5cm, 
ρ=2.203 g/cm3, and E=5.8 ×109 Kg/m2. Hence, the natural frequency of the optical fiber is 
about 54 KHz, which is m uch higher than th e bubble frequency in multiph ase sy stem s 
(usually in the range of  0~1000 Hz). Hence, the glass optical prob e used in this study 
does not resonate in th e bubble column flows.

Table D-2 and D-3 show that at high pressure the gas holdup obtained by the optical 
probe is always higher than that by CT, a nd the cross-sectional gas holdup obtained by 
the optical probe matches the ove rall gas holdup better than that by CT. Hence, at high 
pressure gas holdup obtained by the optical probe is still reliable. The reason for the large 
discrepancy in the gas holdup obtained by CT at high pressure  is still unknown and is to 
be investigated.

D.2  The Effect o f Superfic ial Gas Velocity 
 
Figure D-2 show the radial profiles of the bubbl e frequency at different  Ug and its change 
with Ug. The radial profile of bubble frequenc y is flat in bubbly flow (Ug=2cm /s), and it 
is parabolic at Ug ≥ 8cm /s. From  D-2b, it is obvious that the bubble f requent increases 
with Ug at all radial positions in the colum n.

Figure D-2. The Radial Prof ile of Bubble Frequency 
                    (Sparger #2, z /D=5.1) 
 
Figure D-3 shows the com parison of the bubble velocity dist ributions obtained by two-
point probes (use the central tip and one of  the thre e per ipheral tip s of the four-point 
probe, e.g., Tip0 and Tip1 as shown in Figure 3-21) and by four-point probes. In bubbly 
flow (Ug=2 c m/s), as expected by the si mulation (Figure 3-3a), the bubble velocity 
distribution obtained by two-poi nt probe has higher pdf valu e at high value of velocity 
than by the four-point probe. This is more obvious in transition flow regim e (Ug=8 cm /s, 
Figure D-3b). In churn-turbulent flow, the two-point probe cannot distinguish bubbles 
that m ove upwards and downwards, and it  detects m any bubbles of unreasonably high 
velocity (Figure D-3c and d). This is becau se at high gas holdup, due to the large nu mber 
of bubbles in the bubble colum n, som etimes different bubbles hit the two tips of the two-
point probe alm ost sim ultaneou sly. The algorithm for the two- point probe considers this 
case the sam e as the case when the sam e bubbl e hits the two tips su ccessively, and thus 
derives a very high bubble velocity. For four-p oint probe, the probability that several 
different bubbles hit the four  tips of the pro be alm ost simultaneously is v ery low. 
Furtherm ore, because th e probe has more tip s, more inform ation about th e bubbles that 
hit the probe can be derived so that m any cases can be di stinguished and discarded if  174
needed. This is illu strated by the bubble veloci ty distribution obtained by the four-point 
probe in highly churn-turbul ent flow (Figure D-3b). H ence, it is  exper imentally 
estab lished that th e bu bble velocity distribution obtaine d by two-point probes is not 
reliable, esp ecially in tr ansition and churn-turbulent flow regim e.

Digital simulations were conducted to clarif y whether a single modal bubble chord length 
distribution implies a single modal bubble size  distribution. Figure D-4 shows examples

Figure D-4.  Volume Based Bubble Chord Le ngths Distribution Obtained by 
Four-Point Optical Probe (r/R=0, z/D=5.1) 
 
To derive the bubble size distribution from  the bubble chord length distribution, the  
bubble shape needs to be assum ed. The assum ptions m ade for the sim ulation are: (1) the 
bubbles are ellipsoidal, (2) th e probe hits the b ubble leading surface random ly, i.e. the 
probability that th e pro be tip hits every single point on the bubble leading edge is  
identical. 
 
When he probe tip random ly hits a bubble w ith m inor axis, a, the chord length obtained 
will rang e from 0 to a. The proba bility de nsity function ( pdf) of bubble chord le ngth 
distribution obtained is (Clark and T urton, 1988): 
 
ayayyP ≤≤ = 02)(2       ( D-1) 
 
Assum e that the bubble size (l ength of m inor axis) distribution is bimodal, for sm all 
bubbles it is log-norm al distribution and for large bubbles it is norm al distribution, the 
bubble size distribution and bubbl e chord length distributi on calculated are show n in 
Figure D-5.

In Figure D-5 from (a) to (d), the percen tage of large bubbles  in the whole bubble 
population increased. It is eviden t that when the bubble size di stribution is bimodal, it is 
impossible for the bubble chord length distribu tion to have the shape shown in Figure D-
4. Hence, it is reasonable to conclude that the bubble chord length distributions obtained 
by the four-point optical probe  in a bubble column, as shown in Figure D-4, infer single 
modal bubble size distributions at supe rficial gas velocity up to 60 cm/s.

Appendix E  Testing of Phase Transition At 
Subcritical and Supercritical Conditions Using 
Four-Point Optical Probe 
 
The objective of this study is to evaluate the su itability of the four-point optical probe and 
the algorithm for data processing in stirred autoclave reactors and minireactors (this work 
was supported by the National Science F oundation Engineering Research Centers 
Program, Grant EEC-0310689). In addition, the suitability of  such probe to provide 
transition information from two to single pha se systems in expanded solvents will be 
assessed. This information is necessary for ev aluation of the medium and the selection of 
the reactor type for the pilot plant and commer cial implementation of the test bed reaction 
systems under investigation. 
 
The principle of the optical probe as explai ned in Section 3.2 makes it suitable for the 
detection of the transition of the n-decane-CO 2 system from two phases to one phase 
(expanded solvent) with the increase in the pre ssure. The probe is going to be tested in a 
1 liter autoclave stirre d reactor (Figure E-1) using organic liquid (n-decane) with sparged 
carbon dioxide. At subcritical condition, the CO 2 will form bubbles in the n-decane phase 
and these bubbles can be detected by the opt ical probe. At superc ritical conditions, the 
CO 2 is miscible with organic so lvent. Hence, there should be  no bubbles detected. By this 
means, the transition from two phases to expanded solvent (CO 2 supercritical phase 
systems) can be determined by the optical pr obe. The experimental conditions will be just 
above the critical temperature of CO 2 (31oC), e.g. 35oC. The operating pressure will be 
0.1 to 10 MPa. Above 31oC and 7.28 MPa, the CO 2 will be in supercritical condition. 
Hence, 35oC and 0.1~10 MPa include th e critical point of CO 2. 
  182
It has been proved experim entally that the f our-point optical probe worked efficiently at 
high pressure up to 10 MPa at about 40oC in the n-decane-CO 2 system .

An algorithm  to derive the length of  the bubble ’s minor axis and the bubble’s aspect ratio 
based on the assum ption that bubbles are ellips oidal is suggested in  Section 3.3 (Equation 
3-20).  Unfortunately, the vali dation of the probe’s m easurem ents in a 2D  bubble column 
(Figure 4-5) conducted in this study shows that the proposed algorithm  based on solution 
of Equations  (3-20a-d) d oes not giv e an accu rate estim ate of both aspect ratio and bu bble 
size (Figu re F-1). As illustra ted in Figure F- 1, the algor ithm always underestim ates the  
bubble aspect ratio (Figure F-1a ) and overestimates the length  of the bubble’s m ajor axis 
(Figure F-1b). Furthermore, it is very sens itive to changes of the bubble chord lengths 
obtained by the probe, i.e., sm all changes in the bubble chord lengths m ay cause large 
variations in the calculated bubble size and asp ect ratio. As a result,  this m ethod is not 
recomm ended to investigate the bubble si ze and aspect ratio in bubble colum ns.
