Abstract: The aerobic granular sludge process is a promising technology for the removal of nutrients
and organic contaminants from wastewater. However, a large amount of the sludge is often washed
out during the start-up of granular reactors, which results in reduced process performance and a
protracted start-up phase. In this study, the possibility of a rapid start-up of the nitriﬁcation process
through a stepwise decrease of the settling time was investigated, and the bacterial population
dynamics in two lab-scale sequencing batch reactors were studied. The results demonstrated that
the stepwise decrease of the settling time enabled fast granulation and rapid start-up of the process.
Small cores of granules were already observed after 10 days of operation, and the biomass was
dominated by granules after 28 days. The removal of organic matter and ammonium was >95% after
one day and 14 days, respectively. The bacterial community composition changed rapidly during
the ﬁrst 21 days, resulting in strongly reduced richness and evenness. The diversity increased at a
later stage, and the bacterial community continued changing, albeit at a slower pace. The rate of the
stepwise decrease in settling time strongly affected the abundance of nitrifying organisms, but not
the general composition of the bacterial community. The results of this study support the idea that a
stepwise decrease of the settling time is a successful strategy for the rapid start-up of aerobic granular
sludge reactors.

1. Introduction
Wastewater treatment by means of aerobic granular sludge is a promising high-rate technology
ﬁrst reported in the 1990s [ 1,2]. Granules are self-immobilized microbial aggregates with a strong,
compact structure, and good settleability, which ensures optimum solid-liquid separation and thus
high biomass retention [ 3]. Extensive research has revealed that aerobic granules can be effective
in removing nutrients and organic compounds, even at high loading rates, allowing treatment of
municipal, industrial, and toxic wastewaters [ 4]. Although two decades have passed since the initial
reports, our understanding of the granulation process remains incomplete [ 5]. Current selection
pressure theories consider settling time, volume exchange ratio, and hydrodynamic shear force as the
most important operational parameters affecting the granulation process [ 5,6]. Studies investigating
the effect of settling time (e.g., [ 7–10]) or of hydrodynamic shear force (e.g., [ 11–14]) have mostly
focused on the process performance in addition to the physical and chemical properties of the granules,

while not analyzing the microbial population dynamics. However, these parameters can affect the
bacterial community composition considerably. McSwain et al. [15] obtained entirely different microbial
consortia in the steady-state samples from two parallel reactors operated with different settling times
(2 and 10 min). These differences in the community composition were not reﬂected in the measured
process parameters as the removal efﬁciency of organic matter and the oxygen uptake rate were similar
in the two reactors. Nitrogen removal was, however, not investigated in their study.
During start-up, reduced nutrient removal efﬁciency is often reported, which is hypothesized
to be a consequence of harsh wash-out conditions [ 16]. Decreasing sludge retention time (SRT), a
result of excessive biomass wash-out, is disadvantageous for slow-growing bacterial guilds, such
as ammonium or nitrite oxidizers. The subsequent impact of biomass loss is deteriorated nitrogen
removal efﬁciency. Rapid changes in the microbial population have also been documented during
start-up [ 17,18]; however, very few studies have examined the abundance and dynamics of the
nitrifying community during granulation [ 19]. Based on a modeling approach, Su et al. [20] suggested
that a stepwise decrease of settling time can be an effective method for optimizing biomass discharge
during start-up, but their study did not investigate the nutrient removal during granulation.
The aim of the present study was to explore the performance of the nitriﬁcation process, the
bacterial community dynamics, and the wash-out of nitrifying organisms during the start-up of
aerobic granular sludge reactors with a gradually decreased settling time. Our hypothesis was that
the stepwise decrease of settling time would enable good retention of nitrifying organisms and thus a
rapid start-up of nitriﬁcation in the reactors. The sensitivity of the start-up process to the rate of the
stepwise decrease in settling time was investigated by means of the parallel operation of two reactors
with different rates.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Reactor Set-Up
Two sequencing batch reactors (R1 and R2) were operated in parallel for 112 days. Column
reactors constructed of poly(methyl methacrylate) with a working volume of three liters, a diameter of
6 cm, a total height of 132 cm, a liquid height of 110 cm, and a volume exchange ratio of 43% were
used. The air was introduced from the bottom through a diffuser stone, with a superﬁcial upﬂow air
velocity of 1.5 cm/s, which resulted in saturated dissolved oxygen levels during the aerobic phase.
The inﬂuent entered the reactor from the bottom. The reactors were operated in 4 h cycles, consisting
of 5 min anaerobic ﬁlling, 200–228 min aerobic phase, 2–30 min settling time, and 5 min efﬂuent
withdrawal. The settling time was decreased stepwise from 30 min to two minutes in both reactors
over the ﬁrst 21 days (Figure 1). The rate of decrease differed in the two reactors, thus the ratio of the
discharged to the retained sludge biomass also varied. In R1, the discharge ratio was between 0.01
and 0.07, i.e., 1%–7% of the sludge was discharged with the efﬂuent in one cycle. In R2, the biomass
discharge ratio, varying between 0.02 and 0.14, was always twice as high compared to R1. After day 21,
the settling time was kept constant at two minutes in both reactors until the end of the experiment. The
reactors were seeded with 3 L aerobic/anoxic activated sludge (2 g TSS/L) from a full-scale municipal
wastewater treatment plant (Gryaab) in Gothenburg, Sweden.
2.2. Medium
The reactors were fed with synthetic wastewater consisting of 640.6 mg/L NaCH 3COO, 12.5 mg/L
MgSO 47H2O, 15.0 mg/L CaCl 2, 10.0 mg/L FeSO 47H2O, 100.0 mg/L NH 4Cl, 22.5 mg/L K 2HPO 4, and
1 mL/L micronutrient solution (as described in Tay et al. [21]) in deionized water. All chemicals (VWR
or Fisher Scientiﬁc) were of reagent grade. The organic loading rate (OLR) was 1.5 kg COD/m3/day,
and the nitrogen load was 0.075 kg NH 4-N/m3/day, resulting in a COD:N ratio of 100:5. The hydraulic
retention time was 9.3 h. The pH of the synthetic wastewater was approximately 8.0. The pH and theWater 2016 ,8, 172 3 of 11
temperature in the reactors were not regulated and varied in the range of 7.95–9.05 (Figures S7 and S8)
and 19–21C, respectively.

2.2. Medium 
The reactors were fed with synthetic wastewater consisting of 640.6 mg/L NaCH 3COO, 12.5 
mg/L MgSO 4·7H 2O, 15.0 mg/L CaCl 2, 10.0 mg/L FeSO 4·7H 2O, 100.0 mg/L NH 4Cl, 22.5 mg/L K 2HPO 4, 
and 1 mL/L micronutrient solution (as described in Tay  et al.  [21]) in deionized water. All chemicals 
(VWR or Fisher Scientific) were of reagent grade. The organic loading rate (OLR) was 1.5 kg COD/m
3/day, and the nitrogen load was 0.075 kg NH 4-N/m3/day, resulting in a COD:N ratio of 100:5. 
The hydraulic retention time was 9.3 h. The pH of the synthetic wastewater was approximately 8.0. The pH and the temperature in the reactors were no t regulated and varied in the range of 7.95–9.05 
(Figures S7 and S8) and 19–21 °C, respectively. 
2.3. Chemical Analysis and Microscopy 
During the aerobic phase, mixed liquid sample s of 150 mL were manually removed from the 
reactors using a flexible plastic tube (ø  1 cm) and a syringe for chemical, microscopic, and DNA 
analysis. The concentrations of mixed liquid su spended solids (MLSS) and mixed liquid volatile 
suspended solids (MLVSS) were measured according to Standard Methods [22]. Granulation was investigated using an Olympus BX60 light microscope(Olympus Sverige AB, Solna, Sweden). The effluent chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentrat ion was analyzed spectrophotometrically with 
HACH COD test kits (HACH LANGE). The total susp ended solids (TSS) concentration of the effluent 
was measured according to Standard Methods [22]. NH
4-N, NO 2-N, and NO 3-N concentrations in the 
effluent were analyzed using a FIAstar 5000 analyzer (FOSS Tecator AB, Sweden), and the total nitrogen (TN) concentration was calculated as the sum of these.  
2.4. DNA Extraction and Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) 
Biomass samples were removed twice a week as described in Section 2.3, and the DNA was 
extracted using the FastDNA spin kit for soil (MP Biomedicals), in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol. The qPCR was carried out in 25 µL total volume using 12.5 µL of the SYBR 
Green PCR supermix (Bio-Rad), 10 ng template and 0.3 µM of each primer (forward and reverse). 
Primer pairs, references, and annealing temperatures  are presented in Table S1. All the samples were 
measured in duplicate, using th e Bio-Rad iQ5 real-time PCR detect ion system. The qPCR protocols 
for all primer pairs were as follows: 3 min enzyme activation at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation (95 °C; 15 s), annealing (Table S1; 30 s), elongation (72 °C; 30 s), and data acquisition (80 °C; 30 s), concluding with a final elongation (72 °C; 7 min) and a melting curve (72–95 °C with 0.5 °C 
Figure 1. Settling time in reactor 1 (R1) and reactor 2 (R2). The settling time was decreased stepwise
from 30 min to two min over the ﬁrst 21 days of the experiment and maintained at two min until the
end of the experiment.
2.3. Chemical Analysis and Microscopy
During the aerobic phase, mixed liquid samples of 150 mL were manually removed from the
reactors using a ﬂexible plastic tube (ø 1 cm) and a syringe for chemical, microscopic, and DNA
analysis. The concentrations of mixed liquid suspended solids (MLSS) and mixed liquid volatile
suspended solids (MLVSS) were measured according to Standard Methods [ 22]. Granulation was
investigated using an Olympus BX60 light microscope(Olympus Sverige AB, Solna, Sweden). The
efﬂuent chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentration was analyzed spectrophotometrically with
HACH COD test kits (HACH LANGE). The total suspended solids (TSS) concentration of the efﬂuent
was measured according to Standard Methods [ 22]. NH 4-N, NO 2-N, and NO 3-N concentrations in
the efﬂuent were analyzed using a FIAstar 5000 analyzer (FOSS Tecator AB, Sweden), and the total
nitrogen (TN) concentration was calculated as the sum of these.
2.4. DNA Extraction and Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR)
Biomass samples were removed twice a week as described in Section 2.3, and the DNA was
extracted using the FastDNA spin kit for soil (MP Biomedicals), in accordance with the manufacturer’s
protocol. The qPCR was carried out in 25 L total volume using 12.5 L of the SYBR Green PCR
supermix (Bio-Rad), 10 ng template and 0.3 M of each primer (forward and reverse). Primer pairs,
references, and annealing temperatures are presented in Table S1. All the samples were measured in
duplicate, using the Bio-Rad iQ5 real-time PCR detection system. The qPCR protocols for all primer
pairs were as follows: 3 min enzyme activation at 95C, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation (95C;
15 s), annealing (Table S1; 30 s), elongation (72C; 30 s), and data acquisition (80C; 30 s), concluding
with a ﬁnal elongation (72C; 7 min) and a melting curve (72–95C with 0.5C increments, each for
30 s). Decimal dilutions of linearized plasmid target gene inserts were used as a standard.
2.5. PCR Ampliﬁcation and Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP)
The 16S rRNA genes were ampliﬁed using the HotStarTaqPlus PCR kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany),
with 10 ng template, 0.5 M bacterial primers 27F (6-FAM labeled) and 1492R [ 23], 0.2 M dNTPs,Water 2016 ,8, 172 4 of 11
and 1.25 U DNA polymerase. The PCR reaction was carried out in triplicate, using a Biometra T3000
thermocycler, starting with 5 min of enzyme activation at 95C, followed by 25 cycles of denaturation
(94C, 45 s), annealing (52C, 45 s) and elongation (72C, 105 s), concluding with a 7 min ﬁnal
elongation at 72C. The replicate PCR products were pooled and puriﬁed using the QIAquick PCR
puriﬁcation kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer’s protocol. The samples were then digested with
mung bean nuclease (New England Biolabs, Ipswitch, MA, USA) in order to remove pseudoterminal
fragments, puriﬁed again (QIAquick), and ﬁnally, approx. 160 ng DNA was separately digested
overnight at 37C using the restriction enzymes RsaI and MspI (New England Biolabs). The digested
products were puriﬁed using the Agencourt AMPure system (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA)
and analyzed with a 3730 fragment analyzer (Applied BioSystem).
The results were quantiﬁed with the software GeneMapper (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, MA,
USA) and analyzed based on the relative peak area using the Microsoft Excel template Tools for T-RFLP
data analysis [ 24]. The results from the MspI and RsaI enzyme digestions were then pooled, and after
square root transformation, a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix was generated using the software R [ 25].
Ordination employing non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was performed in the R-package
vegan [ 26]. The diversity of the bacterial community in each sample was assessed by species richness
(the number of species) and by the evenness of the species’ abundances. The Margalef richness and
Pielou’s evenness indices [ 27] were calculated based on the number and relative peak areas of the
terminal restriction fragments (TRFs), using Microsoft Excel.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Biomass Retention and Granulation
During the start-up period of our experiment (the ﬁrst 28 days), the settling time was reduced
stepwise to promote granulation and, simultaneously, retain a large fraction of the biomass in the
reactors. The settling time was reduced more rapidly in reactor 2 than in reactor 1 (Figure 1). As
a consequence, the settled sludge volume and the biomass concentration were lower in R2 than in
R1 during the ﬁrst 28 days (Figure 2). After the settling time was reduced to 2 min in R1 (day 21),
the biomass concentration started to decrease and reached the same value as that in R2 within seven
days. In both reactors, small granules emerged after 10 days, as revealed by microscopy (Figure S1).
The average size of the microbial assemblages (sludge and granules) during start-up increased over
time with no clear difference between R1 and R2 (Figure S2). This indicated that the different rates
of decrease in settling time had minimal impact on the granulation process. After 28 days, granules
dominated the biomass in the reactors.
While in early experiments the settling time was kept constant at a low level from the time of the
ﬁrst cycle [ 28], studies have recently been published in which the settling time was gradually decreased.
For example, Sadrzadeh et al. [9] decreased the settling time very slowly, reaching a 5 min settling time
after 95 days, and therefore the biomass remained ﬂoccular, despite having good settling properties.
Weissbrodt et al. [16] also decreased the settling time in a stepwise manner, but the rate of decrease was
signiﬁcantly faster, reaching the ﬁnal 3 min settling time within 10 days. This led to severe biomass
wash-out on day 8, leaving the reactor with a settled sludge blanket of only 1 cm. Therefore, to prevent
severe biomass wash-out, or the formation of well-settling ﬂocs instead of granules, a balanced strategy
for decreasing the settling time is required during the start-up of granular sludge reactors. Su et al. [20]
suggested that a stepwise decrease of the settling time based on the biomass discharge ratio could be a
successful strategy for achieving fast and effective granulation. According to their model simulations,
the optimal control strategy would be to keep the biomass discharge ratio between 0.01 and 0.05.
This is in good agreement with the discharge ratio in R1 in our investigation, which hereby conﬁrms
experimentally that the control strategy proposed by Su et al. [20] is indeed successful. Although R2
was operated with twice as high biomass discharge ratios during start-up (ﬁrst 28 days), this approach
was still effective in retaining biomass (Figure 2) while facilitating granulation.Water 2016 ,8, 172 5 of 11
Water 2016 , 8, 172 5 of 11 
 biomass discharge ratio between 0.01 and 0.05. This is in good agreement with the discharge ratio in 
R1 in our investigation, which hereby confirms experimentally that the control strategy proposed by Su et al.  [20] is indeed successful. Although R2 was operated with twice as high biomass discharge 
ratios during start-up (first 28 days), this approach was still effective in retaining biomass (Figure 2) 
while facilitating granulation.

of the MLSS in both reactors. 
3.2. Process Performance 
The COD concentration in the effluent was below 50 mg/L from the first day of operation,  i.e., 
the removal efficiency was >95% (Figure 3a). The effluent TSS concentration fluctuated between 0.03 
and 0.23 g/L in both reactors (Figure S5). The ammonium concentration in the effluent started to 
decrease after seven days of operation, and the ammonium removal efficiency reached >95% after 14 
days in both reactors (Figure 3b). The appearance of both nitrate and nitrite indicated that autotrophic nitrification took place, although it is likely that  heterotrophic assimilation also contributed to the 
ammonium removal. The nitrite concentration peaked  after 10 days and then decreased, indicating 
higher ammonium oxidizing bacteria (AOB) activity, followed by an increase in the activity of nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) that converted nitrite into nitrate (Figure 3c). From day 21 to day 42, the effluent nitrate concentration fluctuated between 5 and 10 mg/L (Figure 3d), and the TN removal 
efficiency was between 60% and 75%. In summary, th e stepwise decrease in the settling time allowed 
the reactors to achieve >95% COD and ammonium removal, and 60%–75% TN removal within a mere 21 days. 
Figure 2. MLSS concentration in the reactors. The MLVSS concentration varied between 79% and 94%
of the MLSS in both reactors.
3.2. Process Performance
The COD concentration in the efﬂuent was below 50 mg/L from the ﬁrst day of operation, i.e., the
removal efﬁciency was >95% (Figure 3a). The efﬂuent TSS concentration ﬂuctuated between 0.03 and
0.23 g/L in both reactors (Figure S5). The ammonium concentration in the efﬂuent started to decrease
after seven days of operation, and the ammonium removal efﬁciency reached >95% after 14 days
in both reactors (Figure 3b). The appearance of both nitrate and nitrite indicated that autotrophic
nitriﬁcation took place, although it is likely that heterotrophic assimilation also contributed to the
ammonium removal. The nitrite concentration peaked after 10 days and then decreased, indicating
higher ammonium oxidizing bacteria (AOB) activity, followed by an increase in the activity of nitrite
oxidizing bacteria (NOB) that converted nitrite into nitrate (Figure 3c). From day 21 to day 42, the
efﬂuent nitrate concentration ﬂuctuated between 5 and 10 mg/L (Figure 3d), and the TN removal
efﬁciency was between 60% and 75%. In summary, the stepwise decrease in the settling time allowed
the reactors to achieve >95% COD and ammonium removal, and 60%–75% TN removal within a
mere 21 days.
Results from previous studies that applied a stepwise decrease of the settling time have varied
considerably. Weissbrodt et al. [16] reported reduced nitrogen removal efﬁciency due to severe biomass
wash-out; the ammonium and nitrogen removal recovered after 40 days (to 77% and 60%, respectively).
Liuet al. [17] achieved complete ammonium removal after 49 days, while Zhao et al. [29] obtained
the same after 21 days with simultaneous stepwise decreased settling time and gradually increased
COD and N-load. However, the authors did not provide information about the strategy applied
for decreasing the settling time. Even a gradually decreased settling time does not always lead to
the prompt start of nitriﬁcation. Ebrahimi et al. [30] observed no nitriﬁcation in a reactor operated
at 20Cfor more than 60 days, although the settling time was decreased gradually, at a similar rate
to that used in the present study. Although there are still too few examples from which to draw
any comprehensive conclusions, it is clear that the decrease rate must be adjusted to the operational
conditions and conﬁguration of the reactor in order to achieve the goal of rapid nitriﬁcation start-up.Water 2016 ,8, 172 6 of 11

gradually increased COD and N-load. However, the authors did not provide information about the 
strategy applied for decreasing the settling time. Even a gradually decreased settling time does not always lead to the prompt start of nitrification. Ebrahimi  et al.  [30] observed no nitrification in a 
reactor operated at 20 °C for more than 60 days, although the settling time was decreased gradually, 
at a similar rate to that used in the present stud y. Although there are still too few examples from 
which to draw any comprehensive conclusions, it is clear that the decrease rate must be adjusted to 
the operational conditions and configuration of the reactor in order to achieve the goal of rapid 
nitrification start-up. 
3.3. Abundance of AOB and NOB 
The results of the qPCR analyses are presented in  Figure 4. The abundance of AOB, as measured 
by 16S rRNA gene copy numbers, decreased dramatically in both reactors during the first seven days (Figure 4a), despite the gradually decreased settlin g time (Figure 1) and the low biomass discharge 
(Figure 2). In R1, the AOB copy number per reacto r volume decreased by one order of magnitude, 
even though the settling time was reduced slowly and the biomass discharge ratio was less than 7%. 
In R2, the settling time decrease (Figure 1) resulted in even lower AOB abundance (a decrease of two 
orders of magnitude compared to the seed sludge).  During the remaining 21 days of the start-up 
period ( i.e., between days 7 and 28), the abundance of AOB increased considerably, as did the 
ammonium oxidizing activity (Figure 3). The observed AOB abundances, as measured by 16S rRNA gene copy numbers (Figure 4a), were confirmed by a parallel measurement of the AOB amoA gene copy numbers (Figure S3) that showed identical trends. The temporal variations of the NOB 
(Nitrospira ) abundance (Figure 4b) were similar to those of the AOB abundance, exhibiting a dramatic

3.3. Abundance of AOB and NOB
The results of the qPCR analyses are presented in Figure 4. The abundance of AOB, as measured
by 16S rRNA gene copy numbers, decreased dramatically in both reactors during the ﬁrst seven days
(Figure 4a), despite the gradually decreased settling time (Figure 1) and the low biomass discharge
(Figure 2). In R1, the AOB copy number per reactor volume decreased by one order of magnitude, even
though the settling time was reduced slowly and the biomass discharge ratio was less than 7%. In R2,
the settling time decrease (Figure 1) resulted in even lower AOB abundance (a decrease of two orders
of magnitude compared to the seed sludge). During the remaining 21 days of the start-up period
(i.e., between days 7 and 28), the abundance of AOB increased considerably, as did the ammonium
oxidizing activity (Figure 3). The observed AOB abundances, as measured by 16S rRNA gene copy
numbers (Figure 4a), were conﬁrmed by a parallel measurement of the AOB amoA gene copy numbers
(Figure S3) that showed identical trends. The temporal variations of the NOB ( Nitrospira ) abundance
(Figure 4b) were similar to those of the AOB abundance, exhibiting a dramatic decrease in the ﬁrst
seven days followed by a steady increase in the subsequent 21 days. No Nitrobacter NOB were detected
(Table S1).
The observed connection between the process performance and AOB/NOB abundance correlates
well with the results published by Val del Río et al. [31], who found that a sludge retention time in
excess of ﬁve days is necessary to obtain a nitriﬁcation efﬁciency close to 100%. In our reactors, the SRT
was below six days (R1) and three days (R2) during the ﬁrst 10 days of operation (Figure S6). During
the rest of the start-up period, the SRT was sufﬁciently high to allow nitriﬁer abundance to increase,
and, consequently, enabled 100% nitriﬁcation efﬁciency.Water 2016 ,8, 172 7 of 11
Water 2016 , 8, 172 7 of 11 
 decrease in the first seven days followed by a st eady increase in the subsequent 21 days. No 
Nitrobacter  NOB were detected (Table S1). 
The observed connection between the process performance and AOB/NOB abundance correlates 
well with the results published by Val del Río  et al.  [31], who found that a sludge retention time in 
excess of five days is necessary to obtain a nitrification efficiency close to 100%. In our reactors, the SRT was below six days (R1) and three days (R2) during the first 10 days of operation (Figure S6). During the rest of the start-up period, the SRT was sufficiently high to allow nitrifier abundance to increase, and, consequently, enabled 100% nitrification efficiency.

(NOB) 16S rRNA. The y-axis on both graphs is shown in a logarithmic scale. 
After day 29, the increased sludge concentration in both reactors (Figure 2) was attributed to not 
sampling the reactors for 10 days. Because of the lo w relative abundance and the slow growth rate of 
the nitrifying organisms, the increased sludge co ncentration was likely a result of heterotrophic 
growth. Therefore, while the absolute abundance of AOB remained approximately the same (Figure 
4), their relative abundance decreased in both reactors (two-fold in R1 and 1.3-fold in R2, calculated 
from the AOB and the universal 16S rRNA gene copy numbers). Even though the relative abundance decreased, the nitrification process performance was not affected because the unchanged absolute 
abundance of AOB ensured full ammonium removal until day 40. 
An immediate decrease in the sludge concentr ation and an unexpected disturbance of the 
nitrification process was observed after the sampling was resumed on day 40. In R1, the increase in nitrite concentration on days 43 and 47 implied de creasing NOB activity (Figure 3). The following 
increase in the ammonium concentration (days 52– 54) and a concomitant decrease in the nitrate 
concentration implied decreasing AOB activity. In R1, the TN removal dropped to as low as 1%, and 28 days were needed for the reactor to fully recover its performance. R2 appeared less sensitive to the 
disturbance; the nitrite and ammonium concentrations peaked later than in R1 (day 54 and 57, respectively), and the peaks were significantly smal ler. In R2, the TN removal only dropped to 30%, 
and the reactor’s performance recovered within 14 days. 
Our hypothesis was that (a) the resumption of the sampling of the reactor content resulted in a 
dramatic decrease in sludge concentration and henc e a reduction of AOB abundance, and (b) that the 
slow growth rate of the nitrifying bacteria delayed the recovery of the nitrific ation process. The restart 
of the regular sampling procedure decreased the biom ass content to less than  half of the preceding 
concentrations (Figure 2) in both reactors within 14 days (between days 40 and 54). The removal of the biomass resulted in the elimination of a large part of the AOB community, over 90% and over 70% in R1 and R2, respectively (Figure 4a). In R1, the abundance of NOB decreased by more than 
50% from day 40 to day 46; however, in R2, the minor disturbance in nitrite conversion was not a 
direct consequence of the sludge removal, but li kely a result of the fragile balance between the 
mutualistic guilds of NOB and AOB [32].

(NOB) 16S rRNA. The y-axis on both graphs is shown in a logarithmic scale.
After day 29, the increased sludge concentration in both reactors (Figure 2) was attributed to not
sampling the reactors for 10 days. Because of the low relative abundance and the slow growth rate of
the nitrifying organisms, the increased sludge concentration was likely a result of heterotrophic growth.
Therefore, while the absolute abundance of AOB remained approximately the same (Figure 4), their
relative abundance decreased in both reactors (two-fold in R1 and 1.3-fold in R2, calculated from the
AOB and the universal 16S rRNA gene copy numbers). Even though the relative abundance decreased,
the nitriﬁcation process performance was not affected because the unchanged absolute abundance of
AOB ensured full ammonium removal until day 40.
An immediate decrease in the sludge concentration and an unexpected disturbance of the
nitriﬁcation process was observed after the sampling was resumed on day 40. In R1, the increase in
nitrite concentration on days 43 and 47 implied decreasing NOB activity (Figure 3). The following
increase in the ammonium concentration (days 52–54) and a concomitant decrease in the nitrate
concentration implied decreasing AOB activity. In R1, the TN removal dropped to as low as 1%, and
28 days were needed for the reactor to fully recover its performance. R2 appeared less sensitive to
the disturbance; the nitrite and ammonium concentrations peaked later than in R1 (day 54 and 57,
respectively), and the peaks were signiﬁcantly smaller. In R2, the TN removal only dropped to 30%,
and the reactor’s performance recovered within 14 days.
Our hypothesis was that (a) the resumption of the sampling of the reactor content resulted in a
dramatic decrease in sludge concentration and hence a reduction of AOB abundance, and (b) that the
slow growth rate of the nitrifying bacteria delayed the recovery of the nitriﬁcation process. The restart
of the regular sampling procedure decreased the biomass content to less than half of the preceding
concentrations (Figure 2) in both reactors within 14 days (between days 40 and 54). The removal of
the biomass resulted in the elimination of a large part of the AOB community, over 90% and over 70%
in R1 and R2, respectively (Figure 4a). In R1, the abundance of NOB decreased by more than 50%
from day 40 to day 46; however, in R2, the minor disturbance in nitrite conversion was not a direct
consequence of the sludge removal, but likely a result of the fragile balance between the mutualistic
guilds of NOB and AOB [32].
The simultaneous shifts in AOB abundance and ammonium turnover suggest that autotrophic
nitriﬁcation was the main ammonium removal pathway in this study, despite the very low relative
abundance of AOB (0.001%–0.09%) in both reactors throughout the experiment.
3.4. Bacterial Community Structure
During the initial 21 days, the microbiome changed rapidly (Figure 5), adapting to the operational
conditions in the lab-scale reactors (different from those of the full-scale activated sludge process) and
initiating granulation. Diversity, measured as species richness and evenness, decreased during the
start-up period (Figure 6). Until day 8, R2 was dominated by two TRFs (TRF 23 and 151, see Figure S4),Water 2016 ,8, 172 8 of 11
while R1 exhibited slightly higher diversity (although TRF 23 was still abundant). After day 13, two
other TRFs (TRF 54 and 118) appeared in both reactors and they dominated until day 40. On day 40,
the resumption of sampling the reactor content likely contributed to the following evolution of the
community: the abundance of the dominant TRFs decreased, as well as species diversity increased and
continued to increase until the termination of the study period (Figure 6). The dissimilarity between
the bacterial community of the seed sludge and that of the granules continued to increase (Figure 5).

Figure 6.  bacterial community, as measured by T-RFLP. ( a) Richness; and ( b) evenness. 
During start-up, decreased ric hness and evenness compared to the seed sludge has been 
previously reported [16, 30]. The decreased diversity is presum ably a consequence of the wash-out 
conditions typical of the start-up in granular slud ge reactors. However, the diversity of steady-state 
granular sludge can be remarkable. In a study by Winkler  et al.  [33], the microbial community of a 
pilot-scale steady-state aerobic granular sludge reactor exhibited similar richness and evenness as 
that for a full-scale activated sludge reactor. Granular sludge provides different ecological niches due to its compact structure and the substrate gradients (which evolve as the granule size increases). The 
variety of niches together with the high biomass retention time facilitates high species diversity [33]. 
Therefore, it can be speculated that the increasing diversity after day 40 in the present study is related 
to an increase in nitrate respiration (denitrificati on), as indicated by the concomitant decrease in 
effluent nitrate concentration in R2 (Figure 3d). 
Despite the somewhat different start-up conditio ns, both reactors exhibi ted a similar trend in 
richness and evenness (Figure 6), as well as a similar evolution of the bacterial community (Figure 5). This is in contrast to the study by McSwain  et al.  [15], in which entirely different bacterial communities 
developed in reactors operated with settling times of 2 min and 10 min. These authors reported that 
the constant 2 min settling time from the first day of operation resulted in severe biomass wash-out. 
Hence, the large difference in settling time coup led with biomass wash-out presumably caused 
different communities to evolve in the work reported by McSwain  et al.  [15], while in the present 
study the selection pressure was far more similar in the two reactors. 
4. Conclusions 
A stepwise decrease in settling time based on th e biomass discharge allowed for the selection of 
a balanced microbial population during wash-out. This resulted in rapid granulation and quick start-
up of nitrification in both reacto rs. The settling time in reactor 2 was decreased more steeply than in 
reactor 1, resulting in much lower AOB and NOB abundances in R2. However, this did not lead to any noticeable difference in performance as the nitr ification process started at the same time in both 
reactors. The reactors’ performance and the bacteria l community composition we re strongly affected 
by an operational disturbance ( i.e., the interruption and the subsequent resumption of the biomass 
sampling), with consequenc es similar to a severe wash-out, indi cating the importance of rigorous 
control of biomass retention.
