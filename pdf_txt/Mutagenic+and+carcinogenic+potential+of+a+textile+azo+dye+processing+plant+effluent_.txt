Abstract  17 
The presence of dyes in waste water effluent of textile industry is well documented.  In 18 
contrast, the  endocrine disrupting effect s of these dyes and waste water effluent have been 19 
poorly investigated . Herein, we studied twenty -three commercial dyes , usually used in the 20 
textile industry , and extracts of blue jean textile wastewater samples were evaluated for their 21 
agonistic and antagonistic estrogen activity.  Total estrogenic and anti -estrogenic activities 22 
were measured using the Yeast Estrogen Screen bi oassay (YES) that evaluates  estrogen 23 
receptor  binding -dependent transcripti onal and translational activities . The estrogenic 24 
potencies  of the dye s and wastewater samples were  evaluated by  dose-response curve s and 25 
compared to the dose -response curve  of 17β-estradiol (E2), the reference compound.  The 26 
dose-dependent anti-estrogenic activities of the dyes and wastewater samples were 27 
normalized to the known antagonistic effect of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4 -OHT) on the induction 28 
of the lac Z reporter gene by E2. About half azo textile dyes  have anti -estrogenic activity  with 29 
the most active being Blue HFRL. Most azo dyes however have no or weak estrogenic 30 
activity. E2/dye or E2/waste water ER competitive binding assays show activity of Blue 31 2 
 HFRL, benzopurpurine 4B, Everzol Navy Blue FBN, direct red 89 BNL 200% and waste 32 
water samples indicating a mechanism of action common to E2. Our results indicate that 33 
several textile dyes are potential endocrine disrupting  agents. The presence of some of these 34 
dyes in textile ind ustry wastewater may thus impact the aquatic ecosystem.   35

1. Introduction  39 
 40 
Dyes are widely used in most industries  such as those manufacturing  paper s, plastic s, food, 41 
cosmetics, textile s or leather s. These dyes are useful to colou r the final  products . Dyes are 42 
classified depending on their color s, their chemical structure s and/or  their origin (natural or 43 
synthetic ). Natural dyes most  frequent ly originate  from  plants (such as riboflavin or β- 44 
carotene). Determination of the chemical structure s of natural dyes  and the accomplishment of 45 
their synthesis allow  the gradual replacement  of these natural dyes by their synthetic 46 
counterparts . Approximately 10.000 commercia l dyes are used in the coloring industr y. M ore 47 
than 10% of dyestuff used during the coloring  processes does not bind to the fibers and 48 
therefore these excess dyes are  released into the environment  producing  serious 49 
environmental pollution (Pearce et al. , 2003; Rajeswari et al. , 2011 ). The presence of these 50 
dyes in wastewater  and subsequently in water  resources , even at very low concentrations, is 51 
easy to observ e visually  as the result of textile industry activities . They may increase  effluent 52 
toxicity and lead to  environmental damage  (Robinson et al. , 2002 ). In addition, m any 53 
synthetic dyes are poorly biodegradable . In some dyehouse effluent s, dye concentration can 54 
reach up to  400 mg/l (O’Neill at al. , 1999) . A specific study has even demonstrated that these  55 
concentrations can exceed 600 mg/L in Nigeria (Yusuff and Sonibare , 2004) . Their presence 56 
in water reduces light penetration  and has  a negative impact  on photosynthesis . Moreover, the 57 
dyeing process  itself  generally also  contribute s to the water body contamination by  chromium, 58 
zinc and copper which  are all toxic to aquatic plants and fish below 1.0 mg/L (Eremektar et 59 
al., 2007; Sharma et al. , 2007; Verma, 2008 ). The research on textile wastewater  toxicity , 60 
which has been  carried out so far , shows how the a ction of toxic dyes  occurs at different 61 
levels of the food chain, from food supply  (i.e. algae and plants) to consumers (i.e. 62 
crustaceans and fishes) ( Manu et al. , 2003;  Robinson et al., 2002;  Sharma et al. , 2007 ; Soni et 63 
al., 2006; Tigini et al. , 2011). Most research effort has  been devoted  towards elucidating  or 64 3 
 improving the degradation mechanisms  of textile dyes with the hope to  reduce  their toxic ity 65 
level s (Phugare et al. , 2011a,b) . Environmental regulations in most  countries (i.e. EU 66 
directive 91/271)  have prioritized  in wastewater dye decontamination  in orde r to minimize 67 
environmental damage (Robinson et al. , 2001).  Although the  Environmental Protection 68 
Agency (EPA) has emitted  new practice guidelines for environmental management, the 69 
presence of poll ution dyes remains  a serious environmental issue  specifically  for small  textile 70 
industries in various countries (e. g. China, India, Taiwan) where working conditions and low 71 
economic status do es not allow an efficient  wastewater treatment  before disposal  into water 72 
sources  (Mathur et al. , 2005;  Gregory et al. , 2007 ; You et al. , 2009 ). Since the mid nineties, 73 
the links between dyes, environmental impact and  cancer emergence  have been  the subject of 74 
considerable interest both from researchers and  from  the gene ral public. However, the causal 75 
relationship between dyes and certain types of cancer  is difficult to  establish . Several studies 76 
have been conducted on the toxicity , mutagenicity  and genotoxicity of textile dyes (Bakshi et 77 
al., 2003;  Ben Mansour et al. , 2007; Dogan et al. , 2005;  Durnev et al. , 1995;  Mathur et al. , 78 
2007 ; Schneider  et al ., 2004 ). In the case  of azo dyes, the increase in bladder cancer 79 
incidence , observed among textile industry worker s, has been linked to prolonged exposure to 80 
these  dyes. A report of experts from  the “Cosmetic Ingredient R eview  Committee”  confirmed 81 
that some ant hraquinone dyes , like the  disperse Blue 7 dye, used in the cosmetic industry as 82 
hair colorant and in textile, induce genotoxicity in bacteria  (Cosmetic ingredient, 2007 ). Since 83 
then, research on these dyes confirmed  their carcinogenic effects for humans and animals 84 
(Tsuda et al. , 2001 ). This t oxic effect has been  linked to their p resence  in the environment 85 
(Dogan et al. , 2005 ; Chou et al. , 2007 ; Tigini et al. , 2011 ). From  an environmental point of 86 
view, toxicity, genotoxicity and mutagenicity of industrial  effluent s have been demonstrated 87 
(Alves de Lima et al. , 2007;  Grinevicius et al. , 2009;  Tigini et al. , 2011 ). However, these 88 
effects have general ly not been  linked to the presence of dyes . Chou and collaborators  89 
associated the dioxin -like activity of some dyeing wastewater with the presence of specific  90 
anthraquinone dyes  (Chou et al., 2006, 2007) . In the same studies, these authors demonstrated 91 
that disperse blue 56 can b ind the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which is involve d in 92 
many physiological functions such as cell regulation and reproduction. Two Brazilian  studies 93 
have identified that the mutagenic activity of the Cristais River, a drinking water source of 94 
São Paulo, is caused by the presence of three blue dyes;  C.I. Disperse Blue 37 contribut ing to 95 
55% of this effect (De Arag ão et al. , 2005 ).  96 4 
 Up to now, the estrogenic activity of dyes has seldom been studied. Rare studies 97 
mainly report  the effects of  food colors , such as  tartazine ( E102 ) and erythrosin B  (E127 ). 98 
Both  compounds affect  chromosome  structure  and increase Estrogen Receptor ( ER) site- 99 
specific DNA binding to Estrogen Response E lement (ERE)  in HTB 133 cells ( Roychoudhury 100 
et al. , 1989)  and in the E -screen test ( Datta et al. , 2008 ). The present  manuscript  investigate s 101 
both the estrogenic and anti-estrogen activities  of twenty three  pure commercial  textile dyes  102 
using the Yeast Estrogen Screen  (YES) . This in vitro  assay ha s been developed for the 103 
detection of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs).  In order to indentify estrogen and anti - 104 
estrogen  activity  of textile dyes, the YES assay has been used to probe two different modes of 105 
action. First, a reporter gene assay  measure s the impact of dye binding on ER on its ability to 106 
promote binding -dependent transcriptional and translational activity.  Second, an ER 107 
competitive binding assay  measure s how a dye competes with 17
-estradiol ( E2)-dependent 108 
ER activation . In addition , the endocrine activity (estrogenic and anti -estrogenic activity) has 109 
been assessed on a textile effluent coming from a blue jean manufacturing Tunisian industry  110 
in an attempt  to correlate the endocrine  activity observed for commercial compounds and that 111 
obtained for dyeing wastewater . 112

2. Materials and methods  114 
 115 
2.1. Selected dyes  116 
 117 
All the dyes selected (23) in this study are used in the textile industry (Table 1  and 2 ). 118 
Only, 17 on 23 dyes have a known or communicated structure. The structure of the 6 other 119 
dyes were confidential and not available  in the chemical abstracts service.  However , the 120 
safety an d chemical information  certificate of analysis  usually indicates the nature of the dye 121 
(azoic or ant hraquinone -type chemical structure). For each dye, a  stock solution (1 0 g/L) was 122 
prepared by dissolving in distilled water , followed by filtration through  Whatmann No. 5 filter 123 
paper. All these dyes appeared perfectly soluble in water at this concentration as assessed by 124 
the absence of precipitate.  For each dye, the  endocrine activity was assessed  at four 125 
concentrations in the range of 1×10−5 g/L to 1 g/L. The natural fluorescence  of the dyes and 126 
their interference on  the fluorescence emitted  by yeast was determined beforehand  in order to 127 
avoid spurious signals generated by the YES test  in our experimental conditions . The 128 
fluorescence of eac h dye has been measured in the absence of yeast cells  and subtracted from  129 5 
 the data obt ained for estrogenic tests. The quenching potential of the dyes was also assessed  130 
on the yeast fluorescence emission during  the antiestrogenic test  as follows . The fluor escence 131 
of yeast cell has been measured  after 6  h of incubation of the reference compound  E2 (from 132 
Sigma -Aldrich, St Quentin -Fallavier, France ). Then, e ach dye was added  to the medium at 133 
various concentrations and the fluorescence quenching was measured  immediately . 134 
Compound s inducing more than 10% of fluorescence quenching  were not investigated further 135 
for anti -estrogen ic activity  (noted by an asterisk in Table 2) . The cytotoxicity of each dye was 136 
evaluated  by measuring yeast growth at an O.D. of 600 nm . 137 
 138 
2.2. Wastewater sampling and extraction  139 
 140 
Wastewater samples (1  L) were collected from the textile effluent of an industrial blue 141 
jeans factory in Tunisia . Raw water samples were centrifuged (2000  g, 15  min) to eliminate 142 
solids  in suspension . Supernatants were th en extracted by solid -phase extraction as described 143 
by Pillon et al.  (2005). Briefly, aqueous sample s were concentrated on reverse -phase C18 (5  144 
g, 20  mL) cartridges (Sigma -Aldrich, St Quentin -Fallavier,  France) preconditioned with 145 
methanol. Compounds eluti on from the column  was triggered  using  methanol followed by 146 
hexane. Eluates were dried at 37°C in a rotary evaporator and residues were taken up in 2 mL 147 
methanol (concentration factor: 500).  148 
 149 
2.3. Yeast  estrogen screen assay (YES)   150 
 151 
2.3.1. Assay of estrogenic a nd anti-estrogenic  activity  152 
 153 
Both agonist and antagonist activities of chemical dyes  were examined using the Yeast 154 
strain BY4741 (Euroscarf, Frankfurt, Germany) . This recombinant yeast strain carries the 
 - 155 
galactosidase reporter gene under the control of t he ERE  and contains  the human ER  cloned 156 
into the constitutive  yeast expression vector pAAH5  (García -Reyero et al. , 2001 ). The test 157 
measure s 
-galactosidase activity ( fluorescence at 460  nm and excitation at 355 nm) with a 158 
fluorimeter  (Fluoroskan  Twinkle LB  970, BERTHOLD Technologies ) after 6 h of exposure to 159 
the compounds to evaluate . Tests were performed in 96 -well plates.  To determine  the estrogen 160 
agonist activity  of dyes and effluent sample s, E2 was used as a positive control and distillated 161 
water was us ed as a negative control. Four  dye concentrations were  tested in the range of 162 6 
 1×10−5g/L to 1 g/L. For the effluent samples, a series of dilution s (1 to 1000  of concentrated 163 
extract ) were tested for their estrogenic activity . To determine th e estrogen antagonist activity  164 
of the dyes, 4-OHT was used as a positive control  and E 2 (1 nM) was  used as a negative 165 
control. In the antagonist test , the ability of the dye to compete with E2 for bin ding to ER 166 
and/or inhibit the receptor functions was evaluated . The tested dyes or 4-OHT, the positive 167 
control , were combined with 1  nM E 2 before the start of the assay. All experiments were 168 
performed in triplicate. For estrogen agonist activity, the half maximal effective concentration 169 
(EC 50) was calculated based on the sigmoidal dose –effect curve of E 2. For estrogen  antagonist 170 
activity, the half -maximal e ffective concentration ( AC 50) was calculated based on the 171 
sigmoid al dose –effect curve of 4 -OHT . 172 
 173 
2.3.2. Competitive binding assay  174 
 175 
Competition between dyes and/or sample effluent and E2 was measured at various 176 
concentration s of E2. T extile dye concentratio n used is 0.01g/L and the textile dyeing effluent 177 
sample at a dilution factor 5 of the concentrated extract . Thus any decreas e of 
 -galactosidase 178 
activity after 6 h of exposure indicates  that the dye  induces a decrease in  E2 binding .   179 
 180 
2.4. UV/Visible spectrum deconvolution  181 
 182 
The absorbency spectrum of a water  sample  can be decomposed into a few numbers  of 183 
spectra (reference spectra) . The shape of the UV spectrum can be considered as a linear 184 
combination of defined spectra (REF 1,.., REF p) related to potential compounds present in 185 
studied  water sample  (Thomas et al. , 1996 ). Sw = Σ ai × REF i +/- r, where  Sw is the final 186 
spectra,  ai and r are the coefficient of the ith reference spectra and the admitted error , 187 
respectively . The Secomam company  (Alès, France)  has developed the UVPro software based 188 
on advanced UV spectral deconvolution  (UV PRO, 2000 ) which allows creating dedicated 189 
models a nd determination of reference spectra from a set of studied wastewater UV spectra.  190 
The UVPro software has been applied to the textile effluent of an industrial blue jeans factory 191 
of Tunisia. The reference spectra used for the deconvolution are obtained fro m the 23 selected 192 
textiles dyes (Table 1) . Using the deconvolution model, it is possible to assess the 193 
contribution of studied dyes  in the wastewater spectrum . 194 
 195 7 
 3. Results  / Discussion  196 
 197 
3.1. Estrogenicity / anti -estrogenicity studies of individual dyes  198 
 199 
YES  allows  a fast determination of both endocrine agonist and antagonist actions. The 200 
relative  estrogenicity of each dye has been estimated using YES  by comparison  to the 201 
estrogenicity of E2 as reference compound. Typical dose -response curves for E2 have been 202 
establ ished (data not show n).  In the present study , we have essentially analyzed azo dyes.  203 
These  dyes are extensively used for dyeing cotton in textile industries. By using YES assay  in 204 
the present work, we have analyze d the degree of interference of textile  dyes with the 205 
endocrine system  considering both the potential agonist and antagonist actions. A great 206 
variability between dyes is observed. The YES assay data illustrate a dose -dependent estrogen 207 
agonist activity from 1 ×10−5 g/L to 1 g/L for three dyes ( Yellow Flavina CXL, Reactive dye  208 
red 3BS and Solvent yellow 56) (Figure 1). All these dyes have weak estrogenic effects since 209 
the maximum activity  is obtained at 1 g/L.  In addition, the estrogenic effect of the dyes did 210 
not saturate precluding the determination of the EC 50 value , contrary to the positive control E2 211 
(EC 50 value at 1 ng/L)  (Figure 1). Higher dye concentrations were not investigated, since 212 
water body  dye concentration in the environment never exceed s 1 g/l. Table 2 also 213 
summarizes the fact that the twenty other dyes had no estrogenic effect by themselves.  These 214 
results indicate  that these dyes are not  xenoestrogen s that should  highly impact  the 215 
environment, as compared  to E2 or other known xenoestrogens (e. g. bisphenol A, paraben...) 216 
(Routledge et al. , 1998) . 217 
In addition, some textile dyes have an anti -estrogenic activity . The anti -estrogenic 218 
reference compound 4 -OHT was used to demonstrate efficient anti -estrogenic activity when 219 
incubated in the presence of 1 nM  E2. The AC 50 value of 4 -OHT was 0.5 µM or 0.02 mg/L 220 
(Table 2). Similar experiments were conducted with the dyes. Only some dyes have been 221 
tested (Figure 2), the other ones, marked by an asterisks, could not been tested because they 222 
quenched the 
 -galactosidase fluorescence. At a concentration of 1  g/L, antagonistic activit ies 223 
of these dyes vary from 100% to 10% inhibition according to their colo ur (Table 2 and F igure 224 
2A). Blue and red dyes show the highest inhibition potential. Everzol navy blue FBN, blue 225 
HFRL,  Direct Red 89  BNL 200%  and Benzopurpurine 4B  (Red 4B) are the most potent 226 
inhibitors tested . Their inhibitory effects remain  however inferior  to that of 4-OHT . At 1 g/L, 227 
these dyes  are the only ones that  induce  a complete  inhibition  of the reporter gene in yeast 228 8 
 cells. Among these four dyes, Blue  HFRL  is the strong est antagonist; its anti -estrogenic 229 
potency being  approximately 750-fold less than that of 4-OHT.  A reduction of 50% of 
 - 230 
galactosidase activity  is observed for concentrations as low as 15  mg/L . These concentration 231 
values are thus considerably lower than the total color level found in the environment  (400 232 
mg/L). The antagonist effect of  three other dyes  (Benzopurpurine 4B  (Red 4B) , Ever zol Navy 233 
Blue  FBN , and Direct Red 89 BNL ) were , respectively , 3500-, 2500 -, and 1250-fold less than 234 
that of 4-OHT. In contrast, all other dyes were either weak ER inhibitors or non -ER 235 
inhibitors. For instance, Ever zol Blue ED , Red alpacide 3BL , Direct B lue 71, Blue ED 250 , 236 
Direct Black VSF and Blue DERF  were  weak ER inhibitors . The anti -estrogenic activity for 237 
Blue DERF and Direct Blue 71 at 1 g/l, are 10% and 22%, respectively.  Among these dyes, 238 
most are of the azo class  with sulfonated anilin e (Benzopurpurine 4B, Direct Red 89  BNL 239 
200% ) and one is an anthraquinone dye, Ever zol Blue  ED. The Direct Black VSF AZO - 240 
FREE , Blue ED 250 , both being polyazo dye s, Everzo Yellow ED and Red ED (for which no 241 
structures can be disclosed) induce inhibition of  
-galactosidase expression by E2 with AC50 242 
> 1 g/L. 243 
Competition between the textile dyes and E2  was also measured  by varying the 244 
concentration of E2 and maintaining a constant dye concentration  (0.01 g/L, a concentration 245 
that does not fully inhibit E2 effe ct, Figure 2A) . Benzopurpurine 4B, Blue  HFRL and Ever zol 246 
Navy Blue  FBN can compete with E2 for binding to ER (F igure 2B). These dyes induces a 247 
slight inhibition of E2 estrogenic activity when E2 is used at concentrations equal or lower 248 
than 1.10-8 M. No ef fect is observed for higher concentrations of E2.  For example, this 249 
activity decreased from 200000 RLU without dye to 100000 RLU in presence of the Blue 250 
HFRL at 10-8 M E2 . This study also shows that the Red Alpacide 3BL  induces a 44% 251 
inhibition of es trogen ic activity and the metal -complexed azo dye yellow  4G induces a 13% 252 
inhibition  (Table 2) . The competitive binding assay in the YES assay showed that these dyes 253 
can bind specifically to ER in order to induce these antagonist effect s. 254 
 255 
3.2. Estrogenicity / anti -estrogenicity studies of textile effluent  256 
 257 
The textile effluent sample  analyzed presents  a weak estrogenic effect at the maximum 258 
concentration tested ( 5-fold dilution ). At higher concentrations of the sample, the  sample 259 
compounds reduce cell viability (data  not show) precluding the use of the sample for  the 260 
estrogenic assay . For the dilution range  (5- to 10000 -fold), results from the YES bioassay 261 9 
 indicate that the industrial textile effluent presents a  low (below 15%)  but significant 262 
estrogenic activity  (Figure 3A). Also, the effluent sample inhibits 60% of estrogenic activity 263 
(Figure 3B). In competition experiments, in which E2 concentration is varied and a single 264 
dilution dose of the effluent sample is used (5 -fold dilution), t he anti -estrogenic effect is 265 
observable until 10-5 M of E2 (Figure 3 C). The competition effect of the sample  is most 266 
significant at 10-8 M.  267 
The composition of the effluent sample in dyes has not been fully determined. Spectral 268 
analyses indicate that most of its components are blue dye s. Indeed, UV/Visible 269 
deconvolution of the spectrum of a blue jeans manufacturer ’s effluent  of Tunisia  indicates  that 270 
the sample  contain s mainly Blue DERF , Direct Blue 71, Everzol navy Blue FBN, and Grey 271 
GGL  dye according to the spectrum of each individual  dye (Figure 4). The deconvolution of 272 
the sample spectrum did not predict the presence of other dyes.  Interestingly , our studies have 273 
demonstrated that at least three of these  dyes presented anti -estrogenic activity with the YES 274 
assay . Most blue and navy b lue dyes are derived  from  the Reactive Black 5 azo dye, w hich is 275 
classified Xn (harmful). It is also suspected to be mutagenic  and to be associated to  bladder 276 
cancer development (You et al. , 2009) . Nevertheless , without a complete characterization of 277 
the n ature of the dyes being released in the local environment of this factory, the ant - 278 
estrogenic effect of the effluent sample can’t be unequivocally be attributed to these blue 279 
dyes. Since  this effluent is essentially blue, and that some blue dyes are among those 280 
presenting the highest anti -estrogenic effect , suspicion remains however high that  this 281 
Tunisian factory rel eases harmful components in the environment. In addition, it is worth 282 
noting that  the most active dyes have anti -estrogenic AC 50 values (betwe en 15  mg/L and 70 283 
mg/L) that are well below the dye concentration that can be detected in some water bodies 284 
(400 mg/L). If these same dyes are indeed present in the environment, they would present a 285 
real anti -estrogenic activity to local water consumers.  286 
 287 
4. Conclusions  288 
 289 
Our results on the endocrine effects of textile dyes come in complement of those 290 
already published  on the carcin ogenic and mutagenic effects of  dyes. They point to the fact 291 
that some dyes, mainly blue and red dyes, may be endocrine disrupto r compounds. These  292 
observations raise two issues. Concerning environmental pollution, some of these dyes may 293 
be present at concentrations high enough that they may indeed affect life quality by promoting 294 10 
 tumor generation. Textile sewage is therefore a pote ntial health hazard that should require a 295 
better communication on the dyes used by the industry and its method of disposal. In that 296 
respect, it appears as particularly important to efficient ly treat industrial effluent containing 297 
azo dyes before they get  discharged into the environment . The second issue concerns the 298 
pharmacological effect of these textile dyes. Besides 4 -OHT, few compounds have anti - 299 
estrogenic activity. It is therefore of interest to note that some of the dyes that we 300 
characterized have sim ilar anti -estrogenic activity, suggesting that they may be lead 301 
compounds for the development of new 4 -OHT like anti -estrogenic compounds.  302
