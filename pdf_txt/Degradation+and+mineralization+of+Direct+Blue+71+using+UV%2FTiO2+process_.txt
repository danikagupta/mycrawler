Mini Review
In different things, including foods and various materials, 
gaining certain colours is generally obtained by adding substances 
widely known as dyes and pigments [1,2]. In the applied medium, 
water or oil, dyes are soluble materials primarily used for textile 
materials, whereas pigments are typically insoluble substances 
utilized via a dispersion method to obtain different products: inks 
and paints [1-4]. Different dyes are utilized for various product 
colorations in the textile industry, with an estimated amount 
between 7×105 and 7×107 tons worldwide annually [5,6]. The dye 
structure generally consists of two main constituents, namely, 
chromophore and auxochromes. The function of chromophores 
is light absorption to produce a certain colour. Hence, they 
are fundamentally responsible for the dye colour. Examples of 
chromophore groups are azo (-N=N-), carbonyl (C=O) and methine 
(-CH=). Meanwhile, auxochromes have two different functions: 
playing a role in colour enhancement, more precisely, increase the 
colour intensity and a role in dye attachment to the surface of the   
applied medium, in the textile industry, attached dye to the fiber  
surface. In dyes, the auxochromes are classified into two main 
groups: acidic and basic groups. 
While acidic auxochromes can include -OH, -COOH, and -SO3H, 
the basic groups of auxochromes involve -NH2, NHR, and -NR2 [1-
3,7-8]. Dyes are categorized into various classes depending on 
different aspects. However, the classification based on their usage 
and chemical structure are the most popular ways. Depending on the 
type of applied method to the used substrate, dyes are categorized 
into different groups. Such groups include Acid Dyes, Basic Dyes, 
Direct Dyes, Reactive Dyes, Disperse Dyes, Solvent Dyes, Sulfur Dyes, 
Vat Dyes and Mordant Dyes [3,8]. Among different dye types, Direct 
Dyes have great importance due to both their characteristics and 
applications. In terms of their applications, Direct Dyes are applied 
with no requirements for the fixing process, precisely without the 
step of affixing agent. This leads to a simplified dyeing process and 
lowered process operating costs. Their applications include paper, ARTICLE INFO ABSTRACT
Different dyes are used in numerous industries, including food, paper, ink, and the 
textile industry. Among various dye types, Direct Dyes have great significance because 
of their properties and applications. Such applications are paper, cotton, leather, and 
cellulose. The textile industry is considered a main contributor to the water pollution 
problem because it releases large quantities of coloured liquid waste. The majority of 
dyes and their products are considered carcinogenic, toxic, and resistant compounds. 
Therefore, the application of common wastewater treatments is not sufficient for dye 
removal such as adsorption, biological and chemical degradation. The advanced oxidation 
process using photocatalytic oxidation is an effective technique that can mineralize 
complicated aromatics and different organic dyes among various treatment methods. 
In this review, the photocatalytic degradation of Direct Blue dyes is discussed. The 
review is mainly focused on the recent advances in the photocatalysts and their activity 
improvement using different dopants.  Received:

25873cotton, leather, cellulose, and nylon. These dyes are typically water-
soluble with a strong affinity to cellulose fibers. Their solubility is 
enhanced due to the presence of sulfonate groups in some types. 
Though such substances are anionic dyes, their categorization 
is not under the acid dyes class. This is because the attachment to 
the fiber surface does not usually occur by acid groups [8-11]. The 
textile industry waste is a major contributor to aquatic life pollution 
among different waste types due to releasing a huge amount of 
coloured wastewater to the environment. The reason behind such 
significant wastewater amounts is the features of the dyeing process 
itself. The dye bath tank’s draining and cleaning after each dyeing 
process are the two main factors responsible for releasing coloured 
wastewater [12]. As the dye’s usage is dramatically increased due to 
their numerous applications, the effluent of their usage, especially 
textile industries, is considered a big challenge in the wastewater 
treatment area. This is because of various factors: high levels of 
Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Chemical Oxygen Demand 
(COD) [13,14]; most dyes and their by-products are carcinogenic 
and highly toxic compounds [15-19] and difficult to be completely 
degraded because they are more resistant substances for the typical 
water treatment methods such as adsorption, photolysis, biological 
and chemical degradation [20-22]. 
Among different alternative treatments, applying the Advanced 
Oxidation Process (AOP) using the photocatalytic oxidation approach 
is a promising method for resistant materials such as complicated 
aromatics and organic dyes. The use of the photodegradation 
technique leads to degrading highly toxic compounds to 
environmentally friendly minerals [3,20,23-26]. Therefore, this 
way has been attracted many researchers. This minireview 
paper addresses the application of AOP using the photocatalytic 
degradation approach for Direct Blue dyes. This paper’s main focus 
is discussing the recent advances in photocatalytic degradation 
in terms of using different photocatalysts and their modifications 
using various dopants.     
Literature Review  
In terms of Direct Blue dyes, El-Bahy, et al. [27] examined the 
photocatalytic degradation of Direct Blue dye (DB53) using various 
lanthanide ions doped with TiO2. Under UV irradiation, the study 
demonstrated that the type of dopant has a high degree of impact 
on the catalyst surface properties such as texture structure, particle 
size and bandgap. Gd-TiO2 appeared to be the most effective 
catalyst, resulting in the highest dye removal due to its excellent 
surface properties. Using a Cu2O catalyst, it was observed that 
the hydrothermal temperature has a key role in determining the 
main properties of the synthesized catalyst, including the bandgap, 
shape, and surface area. In terms of DB53 degradation, the catalyst 
with a nanorod shape was highly effective compared to other 
catalyst shapes [28]. In contrast, Mohamed, et al. [29] changed the 
hydrothermal time for preparing YVO4 nanoparticles from 4 h to 24 
h. Their study found that the YVO4 nanoparticles with a size of 11 nm exhibit the optimum behaviour of catalyst activity. Sobana, et al. 
[30] applied 2% Ag-doped TiO2 for the degradation of DB53 using 
both UV and solar light irradiation. 
The application of solar irradiation for the Ag-doped TiO2 
registered a higher DB53 degradation than UV light utilization. 
Sobana, et al. [31] concluded that the catalyst activated carbon 
AC-ZnO has a good activity for DB53 removal under solar light 
irradiation. While alkaline pH appeared to be more preferable than 
acidic pH, catalyst grinding showed a negative impact on DB53 
degradation efficiency. Mohamed, et al. [32] observed that the 
energy band gap of Pt/Ti-Na-mordenite catalyst proportionally 
decreases when the amount of Pt is increased. The doping of Pt at 
high concentration (0.4 wt.%) had no significant impact on energy 
bandgap reduction. Under visible light irradiation, 100% DB53 dye 
removal was registered at a Pt concentration of 0.3 wt.% after 60 
min irradiation, resulting in the highest degradation. Sobana, et 
al. [33] used Ag-doped TiO2 for the degradation of DB53 aqueous 
solution. Under UVA irradiation, the study outcomes proved that 
the photocatalyst activity increases as the dopant concentration 
is increased. Ag particles on the catalyst surface work as electron 
traps, resulting in a significant enhancement of electron-hole 
separation and resulting in the reduction of recombination rate. 
In terms of reaction rate, the obtained results showed that 
DB53 dye degradation is described by pseudo-first order kinetics 
using different catalyst types [29-32]. DB71 was degraded under 
UVC irradiation. The findings suggested that high dye removal 
is achieved for two different cases: UV irradiation and UV/
TiO2. In terms of pH solution and temperature, there was little 
effect on DB71 degradation Saien, et al. [34,35] found that the 
prepared catalyst CuO-ZnO has a significantly higher photoactivity 
compared to reagent-grade ZnO under visible light irradiation. 
The nanocomposite with (1:3) CuO-ZnO was the most successful 
application due to obtaining the highest DB71 removal. Habibi, 
et al. [36] demonstrated that the efficiency of DB71 removal 
reached 82% using a bi-component nanocomposite that consists 
of cobalt metatitanate and cobalt oxide. In the presence of 
K7[PMo2W9O39].19H2O and H2O2, the DB71 removal rate registered 
65% for 60 min. The optimal conditions of DB71 removal were 0.6 
g/L, 0.08 mol/L, and 90 min for catalyst loading, H2O2, and reaction 
time, respectively. Under such conditions, the percentage of DB71 
degradation was approximately 87% Tabatabaee, et al. [37,38] 
tested the ability of CuFeO2/ZnO as a photocatalyst for degradation 
of DB71. 
The study demonstrated that the dye mineralization is 
confirmed by TOC measurements at natural pH under visible 
light. Pugazhenthiran, et al. [39] discussed the possibility of Au-
Nx-TiO2 and Au-TiO2 nanospheres application in the degradation 
of DB71. Under solar irradiation, the obtained results showed 
that the synthesized catalysts exhibit a superior photoactivity 
performance. In terms of catalyst stability, the prepared catalysts Copyright@  Ajay K Ray | Biomed J Sci & Tech Res | BJSTR. MS.ID.005411.Volume 33- Issue 3DOI: 10.26717/BJSTR.2021.33.005 411
25874had no photoactivity reduction even after eight consecutive tests. 
Sathishkumar, et al. [40] aimed to increase ZnO photoactivity by 
doping CoFe2O4 on its surface. Under visible light irradiation, the 
activity synthesized catalyst was examined for DB71 degradation 
using a 150 W lamp with a wavelength ( λ ≥ 400 nm). The study 
findings manifested a reduction of optical bandgap energy. In 
the presence of both used catalyst and PMS, the highest value of 
DB71 degradation rate was achieved. Interestingly, a power-law 
model is registered for the DB71 degradation kinetics. Though the 
degradation rate was expressed as a sum of two terms: photolysis 
and photocatalysis, the individual terms had a power order with a 
value of 1.83 and 2.16, respectively Saien, et al. [34]. 
In contrast, the obtained data of DB71 degradation was 
accurately fitted by pseudo-first order reaction kinetics Boumaza, 
et al. [38] As a part of their study, Habibi, et al. [41] investigated 
the degradation of DB160 solution using commercial TiO2 catalyst. 
With a UV source of 400 W, the obtained results found that 
complete decolorization is successfully achieved. With respect to 
the reaction kinetics, pseudo-first order kinetics clearly described 
the DB160 degradation. It was also observed that inorganic ions 
have an inhibitory effect on the DB160 degradation rate Saroj, et al. 
[42] tested different concentrations of Fe-doped TiO2 (Ti1–xFexO2). 
Two different irradiation methods, namely, UV light and direct 
sunlight, were applied for DB199 degradation within real industry 
wastewater. The results revealed that the catalyst Ti0.96Fe0.04O2 
has the highest photoactivity in both reactor types, indicating 
that the reactor type has no influence on the catalyst activity. The 
DB129 degradation was examined by applying the ZnO catalyst. 
By applying the sol-gel method, ZnO nanoparticles were prepared 
using Arabic gum (AG) as a template. Under visible light, it was 
observed that using ZnO nanoparticles leads to a high dye removal 
up to 95% Fardood, et al [43]. 
With respect to DB15 dye, Lamba, et al. [44] synthesized CeO2-
ZnO nanodisks using a precipitation method. In a double-walled 
reactor, an aqueous solution of 50 mg/L DB15 was irradiated using 
natural solar light for 4 h during the time between 10 am to 2 
pm. Their study found that the CeO2-ZnO catalyst shows excellent 
activity that could possibly be due to an enhanced recombination 
rate Ebrahimi, et al. [45] discussed the impact of transition metal 
doped ZnO nanoparticles on the photodegradation of DB 15 using 
both UV and visible light irradiation. The synthesized ZnO was 
doped with three different transition metals: Ag, Cu, and Mn. The 
findings demonstrated that the transition metal-doped catalyst has 
higher activity in comparison with undoped ZnO. For UV irradiation, 
the optimum dye removal was 74%, registered for Ag-doped ZnO. 
In contrast, the Cu-doped ZnO had the highest degradation rate 
with a value of 70% under visible light irradiation. The influence of 
catalyst morphology on its photocatalytic activity was investigated 
by Jo, et al. [46] Among different morphologies, the catalyst with 
nanoflower morphology registered the highest photoactivity. Depending on the surface morphology, the DB15 degradation 
had the following order: nanoflowers > nanotubes > nanospheres 
Deng, et al. [47] increased the surface area of Fe-based metallic 
glass ribbons using etched porous ribbons and evaluated for DB15 
degradation. The outcomes revealed that the application of etching 
treatment in 20% HF solution for 40 min leads to a big improvement 
in the catalytic activity due to obtaining higher rates of DB15 
degradation. Zhan, et al. [48] synthesized Copper hydroxide nitrate 
(Cu2(OH)3NO3) by a solvothermal method using anhydrous ethanol. 
The synthesized catalyst appeared to have a complex structure with 
spherical morphology evaluated for DB15 degradation. The catalyst 
registered a high activity in the DB15 removal compared with the 
catalyst prepared by the typical reaction of NaOH and Cu (NO3)2 in 
an aqueous solution.  
Conclusion
While scanning the relevant literature of Direct Blue dyes, the 
main conclusions are as follows: 
1. The majority of previous studies have been mainly 
focused on two dyes, namely: DB53 and DB71. Meanwhile, 
few studies have been registered for the evaluation of DB15 
photodegradation. 
2. Different dopants have been applied for TiO2 or ZnO 
photocatalyst modification. It is observed that the dopant 
concentration has an impact on the photocatalyst performance. 
However, the higher dopant concentrations have no effect on 
the catalyst photoactivity. 
3. The dopant type influences the photocatalyst surface 
characteristics such as surface texture, particle size and energy 
bandgap. 
4. With different photocatalysts, the photodegradation of 
Direct Blue dyes is well described by pseudo-first order kinetics.
