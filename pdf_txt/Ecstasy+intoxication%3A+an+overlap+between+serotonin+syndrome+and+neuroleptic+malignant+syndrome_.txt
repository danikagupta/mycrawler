Serotonin syndrome
Shameem Mir and David Taylor
Aimsand method To define serotoninsyndromeand
its symptoms and to discover which drugs or drug
combinations are likelyto cause it. A review of literature
(including case reports) relating to serotonin syndrome
collated from searches of MedlJne and Micromedex
covering the period January 1991to July 1998.
Results Mostof the data found were either individual
case reports or reviews of case reports. Reports of
serotonin syndrome seem to be growing, certainly since
the introduction of selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors. Particular combinations seem most likely to
induce serotonin syndrome. Awarenessof thissyndrome
as a distinct clinical entity seems to be growing.
Clinicalimplications Serotonin syndromeismore likely
to occur with drug combinations, especially those
involving monoamine oxidase inhibitors. It can also
occur when swapping antidepressant therapy,
especially if changing from a long acting anti-
depressant such as fluoxetine. Caution isneeded when
changing antidepressants and particularly when they
are used in combination.
Serotonin syndrome appears to be a new
phenomenon. Certainly, awareness of this syn
drome seems to have increased in the last
decade. Early reports date back to the 1950s
and often describe adverse effects of serotonergic
agents rather than defining a particular syn
drome (Gillman, 1999). Sternbach (1991) was
the first to collate and review these case reports.
In this review, Sternbach suggested certaincriteria for the diagnosis of 'serotonin syndrome'
(see Appendix), thus helping clinicians to recog
nise its symptoms and so ultimately furthering
knowledge about it.
The incidence of serotonin syndrome is un
known; one possible reason for this is that
symptoms still go unrecognised, particularly
the milder symptoms, and it is therefore likely
to be under-reported.
True symptoms of serotonin syndrome include
mental state changes (confusion, hypomania),
agitation, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, diaphoresis,
shivering, tremor, diarrhoea, incoordination and
fever. These are sometimes mild and usually
occur within a few hours of a dose or drug
change. In some, however, symptoms can be
more severe and in a very few the syndrome
can be fatal. Symptoms of serotonin syndrome
are often confused with those of neurolepticmalignant syndrome (Lane & Baldwin, 1997):
the two syndromes share some features and
may be difficult to distinguish. Gillman (1999)
has helpfully observed that hyperkinesia is
common to serotonin syndrome, but that
bradykinesia often characterises neuroleptic
malignant syndrome.
Causes of serotonin syndrome
Theoretically, any drug or combination of drugs
that result in a net increase in central seroto
nergic neurotransmission have the potential to
induce serotonin syndrome.In Sternbach's (1991) review of 38 reports of
serotonin syndrome, 35 were a result of combi
nation therapy. The most commonly reported
drug combination to be associated with seroto
nin syndrome was that of L-tryptophan and a
monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), with or
without lithium. This was followed in frequency
by a combination of fluoxetine and MAOIs or L-
tryptophan (note that this review essentially pre
dates widespread use of selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)).
In a later review. Lane & Baldwin (1997) found
the most profound serotonin syndrome reactions
had been reported with a combination of MAOIs
and SSRIs. Their review focused on SSRI-
induced serotonin syndrome, the findings of
which are summarised and updated in Table 1.Gillman's still later review (1999) notes the
occurrence of serotonin syndrome even withshort-acting MAOIs such as moclobemide in
combination with fairly weak serotonin reuptake
inhibitors such as pethidine and imipramine.
Thus, it seems virtually any combination of
serotonergic drugs can cause serotonin syn
drome.
Serotonin syndrome has also been described
with other drug combinations. For example,
with sertraline and amitriptyline (Alderman &
Lee, 1996), phenelzine and dextromethorphan
(Nierenberg & Semprebon, 1993), a combination
of SSRIs (Lane & Baldwin, 1997) and nefazodone
with sodium valproate (Brazelton et al, 1997).
Also, since its recent introduction, there have been
a number of reports of serotonin syndrome with
venlafaxlne in combination with tranylcypromine
(Brubacher et al 1996; Hodgman et al 1997),
phenelzine (Weiner et cd, 1998) and fluoxetine

Many reports of serotonin syndrome (see Sternbach, 1991).
May be used to augment SSRItherapy and treat antidepressant-induced
sexual dysfunction. There have been two reports of serotonin syndrome,
but combination generally well tolerated.
Serotonin syndrome has been reported, this combination should be
avoided.
Appears to be well tolerated as MAO-A shows a preference for the
metabolism of serotonin. Manufacturers warn against the use of SSRIs with
selegiline.
Serotonin syndrome has been reported, combination is potentially toxic,
although Hilton et al (1997) found moclobemide safer than older MAOIs.
This was later supported by Dingemanse et al (1998) who found
moclobemide and fluoxetine to be a safe combination in 18 subjects.
Serotonin syndrome has been reported with a combination of an SSRIand
pentazocine, morphine, tramadol and dextromethorphan (found in some
cough mixtures). Case reports of serotonin syndrome have been described
for tramadol and paroxetine (Egberts et al, 1997) and tramadol and
sertraline (Mason & Blackburn, 1997).
Although serotonin syndrome has been reported, sumatriptan has been
shown to be well tolerated with SSRIsand moclobemide, lithium and
buspirone. However, the risk is unclear as sumatriptan can give rise to
similar symptoms as serotonin syndrome when given alone. See Gardner &
Lynd (1998) for a review of use of sumatriptan with SSRIs, lithium and MAOIs.
Serotonin syndrome has been reported. Crosses the blood-brain barrier

(Bhatara et al 1998). In general, with all drugs the
more severe cases involve the use of MAOIs.
Serotonin syndrome can also result from
changing drug therapy. Table 2 provides some
illustrative examples of switching-induced sero
tonin syndrome.
It is worthy of note that not all the cases
of serotonin syndrome listed above involved
changing to or from an MAOI. Indeed, a straight
swap (generally from fluoxetine) to another SSRI
can clearly induce serotonin syndrome.
Apart from combination therapy and changing
drug therapy, serotonin syndrome has also
been reported, albeit rarely, with single druguse, for example, with L-tryptophan and with
fluvoxamine (Lejoyeux et ai, 1994) and morerecently with clomipramine (Rosebush & Mar-
getts, 1999). Serotonin syndrome has also been
reported as occurring following use of 3,4-
methylenedioxymetamphetamine (MDMA or
Ecstasy) (Demirkiran et al 1996; Mueller &
Korey, 1998). Serotonin syndrome is thus likely
to present in casualty departments as well as in
psychiatric practice.
Reports of serotonin syndrome with drug
overdoses are rare, but in many cases, fatal.
Neuvonen et al (1993) reported five fatal cases of
serotonin syndrome with the combination of

Four reports of serotonin syndrome when patients were swapped
from phenelzine to venlafaxine
moclobemide and citalopram or moclobemide
and clomipramine. Also, Singer & Jones (1997)
describe one case of fatal serotonin syndrome
from an overdose of moclobemide and paroxetine.
Overall, there have been 23 deaths reported to be
linked to serotonin syndrome in the last 10 years
(Gillman, 1999). This probably represents an
underestimate of the total number, since many
cases may not have been reported because of
medico-legal reasons.
Surprisingly, there have been reports of recov
eries after overdose with moclobemide and clomi
pramine (Francois et al, 1997) and moclobemide
and venlafaxine (Roxanas & Machado, 1998).
Biochemical mechanism of serotonin
syndrome
A number of possible mechanisms underlying
serotonin syndrome have been suggested. Themechanism is generally thought to involvebrainstem and spinal cord activation of 5-HT1A
receptors (Sternbach, 1991), although stimulation of 5-HT2A receptors may also be causative
(Gillman, 1999).
The combination of MAOIs and SSRIs appears
to be particularly toxic. This is probably a result
of simultaneous blockade of serotonin reuptake
by SSRIs and the inhibition of serotonin degrada
tion by MAOIs, leaving essentially no mechanism
to control serotonin concentration in the synapse.
Managing serotonin syndrome
Serotonin syndrome is often self-limiting and
symptoms usually resolve within 24 hours of
discontinuing the causal agent. Severe cases
may require the use of a serotonin antagonist
or supportive care. The management will,
therefore, largely depend on the symptoms of

treatments have a largely theoretical basis; none
has been robustly, clinically tested.
Avoiding serotonin syndrome
Many of the episodes of serotonin syndrome
reviewed in this article could have been avoided.
Many recommended drug combinations aim
specifically to increase serotonergic function
and so predictably increase the risk of serotonin
syndrome. Combinations including MAOls andL-tryptophan should therefore be used with
extreme caution.
A combination of two drugs can also occur
inadvertently, for example, when changing drug
therapy from a drug with a long half-life. In such
cases, there may also be the potential for a
pharmacokinetic interaction which may increase
the risk of serotonin syndrome, for example, if
both drugs are serotonergic in action and one
inhibits the metabolism of the other. When
changing drug therapy, the half-life of the dis
continued drug should be taken into considera
tion as well as potential pharmacodynamic and
perhaps, more importantly, pharmacokinetic
interactions between the old and new drug. For
example, SSRls are not only potent inhibitors of
serotonin reuptake, but some, such as, fluox-
etine. paroxetine and fluvoxamine are also potent
inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme
system and therefore have the potential to
increase levels of other serotonergic drugs. Indeed,
all SSRIs (except citalopram) have been shown
significantly to increase tricyclic plasma levels
when given in combination (Taylor, 1995). There
fore, when considering switching from a drug with
a long-half, such as fluoxetine, long wash-out
periods are often necessary in order to avoid therisk of serotonin syndrome. Shorter wash-out
periods may be necessary with other SSRIs.Discussion
Awareness of serotonin syndrome and its
symptoms has rapidly increased and it is now a
recognised adverse effect of antidepressant
therapy. The symptoms are often mild, but in
some can prove fatal.
The risk of serotonin syndrome is difficult to
establish, but from the available literature it
appears that combinations including an MAOI
are likely to be more toxic than others and
should therefore probably be avoided, except in
specialist centres treating refractory depression.
In addition, when changing drug therapy, wash
out periods may be necessary before starting the
new drug.
Management of serotonin syndrome in most
cases is simple, the first step being to discontinue
drug therapy after which in many cases, symp
toms resolve within 24 hours. In theory, more
severe cases may require a serotonin antagonist
such as chlorpromazine, cyproheptadine or pro-
pranolol (for which there is largely only a
theoretical basis for their use) and where appro
priate supportive measures should be provided.

This book discusses the evidence-based assessment of deliberate self-harm, and
covers the special problems of general psychiatric practice when alcohol misuse
and severe personality disorder complicate the picture. Chapters relating to
depressive disorders begin by focusing on opportunities for psycho-social intervention and
liaison with primary care. There are comparisons of 'old' and 'new' antidepressants, and
reviews of strategies for preventing relapse and recurrence, and managing resistant depression.
The special problems of emergency treatment and depression in older patients are identified.
There are expert overviews of brief dynamic psychotherapy, cognitive approaches to treatment,
lithium therapy and modern ECT practice. Many chapters emphasise the importance of the
rational integration of biological and psychological treatments. There is helpful advice on the
specific problems in managing obsessive-compulsive disorder and eating disorders, in dealing
with somatisation, and in providing support and treatment for the victims of severe trauma.
