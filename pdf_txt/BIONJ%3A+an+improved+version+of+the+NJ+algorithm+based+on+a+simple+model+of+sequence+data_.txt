TEN YEARS TRACK RECO RDS  
 
 In 2011, I initiated and then headed  until 2015 the Institute for Computational Biology (IBC) in 
Montpellier, France. This transversal structure involved ~100 researchers (permanent positions, PhDs, 
postdocs) from a number of laboratories belonging to a large scope of domains, ranging from 
mathematics and computer science to biology, medicine and eco logy.  
 In 2015, I moved to the Institut Pasteur, Paris, to create and direct the Centre for Bioinformatics, 
Biostatistics and Integrative Biology (C3BI). We started with a small group of less than 10 people, but 
hired a number of PIs and bioinformaticians . In 2019, the C3BI became the new Computational Biology 
Department that is affiliated to both the Institut Pasteur and the CNRS. The C3BI/Dpt. comprises 5 
Research Units (sequence algorithms, modelling, Bayesian computation, statistical genetics, and my 
Unit in evolutionary bioinformatics) and a large core facility, the Bioinformatics and Biostatistics HUB, 
with 50 engineers having a broad spectrum of expertise, ranging from software development to machine 
learning and biological data analysis.

DEVELOPING COUNTRIES 
 
       For fifteen years, I have been involved in bioinformatics collaborations and training in developing 
countries. I initiated with local organizers and a large community of researchers the first African 
bioinformatics conference, Nairobi, Kenya, 2007 ( URL). This conference became ISCB Africa ASBCB, 
and is still run every two years (Kumasi, Ghana, in 2019). I taught bioinformatics courses intended for students and researchers from developing and emerging countries in a number of places: South Africa, 
Brazil, Uruguay, Morocco, Tunisia, Cambridge, Grece , Vietnam, Paris, Hong Kong… Via the Institut 
Pasteur International Network, I organize several bioinformatics courses every year (Hanoi, Cuba and 
Tunis in 2019), and I regularly host young researchers in my group (2 from Cambodia, 1 from Brazil and 
1 from Cuba in 2019).
