Abstract  
Wastewater  generated by the textile industry has been  a major environmental concern  for a 
long. Production of fiber  involves various steps and uses a lot of chemicals, dyes , and water. 
Therefore,  the effluent  produced  from the textile industry needs  proper purification  before 
discharging into the water body. The current review summarizes  various physical and 
chemical methods like ion exchange,  coagulation -flocculation , membrane separation, 
membrane distillation, oxidation, ozonation , etc., for wastewater treatment . Along with this, 
adsorption methods, the various adsorbents used to purify wastewater, and the mechanism 
involved in adsorption have also been discussed.  The biological  method utilizes various 
microbes (bacteria, fungi , algae , and ye ast) as a whole and the enzymes (laccase and 
azoreductase) secreted  by them for wastewater treatment, which  have been considered more 
feasible than physical and chemical methods . The adsorption and biological  methods are 
better than other techniques  due to their  ability to degrade diverse classes of dye, less 
accumulation of harmless sludge, and cost -effective  and safer approach for the disposal  of 
textile effluent. While physical and chemical methods are expensive  and generate toxic sludge , 
which is difficult to decompose.  Recent Progress in Materials  2022; 4(4), doi:10.21926/ rpm.2204028

1. Introduction  
Water is e ssential to life. It is required for survival, making it one of the most important and 
potent elements of life for all living things . Unfortunately,  rapid industrialization, modernization , 
and various anthropogenic activities have contaminated water bodies . The textile industry has also 
become  one of the biggest environmental challenges , despite playing a key part in meeting people's 
basic needs since the beginning [1-3]. It has been estimated that  textile dyeing contributed nearly 
20% of global wastewater, or around 93 billion cubic meters  producing highly colored  wastewater  
[4]. About 7 × 107 tons of synthetic dyes are produced annually worldwide, with over 10,000 tons 
of such dyes by textile industries [5].  In addition to being one of the most polluting industries, it is 
also the largest consumer of water, resulting in water depletion and a  threat to water scarcity. 
Directly discharging untreated wastewater containing dyes into water bodies creates pollution that 
ultimately damages water quality and causes major health problems in humans [6, 7] . Several 
reports are  available in the literature to prove the health hazard related to dyes  [8, 9] . The minute 
amount of metals discharged by textile effluents  is toxic to animals and humans  [10, 11] . The highly 
contaminated water enters  into the groundwater , which deteriorate s the water quality  of 
groundwater . Textile dyes are highly carcinogenic and may cause various  skin and eye ailments  in 
human s. e.g.,  dermatitis, allergic conjunctivitis, and occupational asthma are common  diseases  
caused  by textile dyes  [12, 13] . The most probable reason for the ailments caused by te xtile dyes is 
the replacement or denaturation of enzymatic activity  [14]. In addition, it degrades the aquatic 
ecosystem, as the dye in the water reduces its transparency, inhibits photosynthesis, and 
subsequently lowers dissolved oxygen  (D.O.) , harming  both aquatic flora and fauna  [15]. At 
decreased D.O.  level , the microorganis m could not survive , and the natural process of 
decomposition of organic waste by bacteria and other microorganisms  does  not occur , which results 
in the accumulation of organic waste in the water body . Pollutants such as dyes, various organic 
and inorganic compounds, and heavy metals such as Hg, Cr, Pb, and As, which are poisonous by 
nature and represent significant environmental issues, are prevalent in textile industry wastewater  
[16-18].  
The production of fabric from textile fiber  involves many  steps , as shown in Figure  1, and 
substantial  amounts of chemicals are used at each step , further increasing  water pollution  [19]. Dye 
is the primary pollutant in textile effluent water  [20]. Dye effluents are generated because dyes are 
not completely fixed to the fiber  during the dy eing and finishing operations [21, 22] . Dye molecules 
have a complicated aromatic backbone and contain  several auxochromes that give them  a beautiful  
color . Therefore , they have a very complex and stable structure that poses greater difficulty in 
breakdown and degradation ; hence  removal from textile effluent  becomes more challenging  [23]. Recent Progress in Materials  2022; 4(4), doi:10.21926/ rpm.2204028 
 
Page 3/21  
Figure 1  Various processes  occur  in the production of fabric from the fiber . 
There are various categories of dyes based on origin, structure, and application , such as acidic, 
basic, disperse, direct, reactive, azo, diazo , and mordant dye , summarized in Figure 2  [24]. 
 
Figure 2  Classification of dyes . 
Recent Progress in Materials  2022; 4(4), doi:10.21926/ rpm.2204028 
 
Page 4/21 Azo dye represents the greatest production volume in dyestuff chemicals today , and their 
relative importance may grow. These  are extensively used in the textile, paper, food, leather, 
cosmetics , and pharmaceutical industries  and account  for about 50 % of all dyes synthesized  [25]. 
Due to the ease of coupling reactions , it is possible to synthesize  the desired  dye, which is suit able 
for a wide range of applications  [26]. The intricate structure of dyes prevents their degradation;  
thus,  they remain in the water for longer.  For instance, the half -life of hydrolyzed  Reactive Blue 19 
is about 46 years at pH 7 and 25° C [27]. Since most of the azo dyes under anaerobic conditions 
decomposed as aromatic amines , which can act as carcinogens and mutagens, their removal from 
wastewater before  discharg e into water bodies is of utmost importance and is a challenging task to 
formulate high -efficiency  treatment methods  [28, 29]. The treatment of wastewater to make them 
suitable for subsequent use requires physical, chemical , and biological processes , which are 
depicted in Figure 3 [30]. In the textile industry , selecting  the most efficient and cost-effective  
treatment processes or their combinations is contingent on the dyestuffs and dyeing techniques 
employed in production  [27, 31 -33]. 
 
Figure 3 Various treatment  methods used for the purification of textile effluents . 
1.1 Physical Methods  
Various physical methods , such as  ion exchange  [34], membrane separation [35, 36] , and 
adsorption  [32], etc.,  have been employed for many years for the treatment of wastewater  [37]. Ion 
exchange is a well -developed technique involving an exchange of mobile ions from an external 
solution that is electrostatically bound to the functional groups within a solid matrix  [38].  It is used 
for purifying, separating , and decontamination of aqueous and other ion -containing solutions [39]. 
Despite its wide applications, there are limitations associated with the ion exchange method as it 
generates a highly concentrated waste that requires  careful disposal.  Generally, it is ineffective to 
treat all categories of dyes  and for wastewater containing high concentrations of metal ions such as 
Fe, Mn, Al , etc. Membrane separation processes such as reverse osmosis (RO) [40], nanofiltration 
(NF) [41], and microfiltration (MF) [42] have also been successfully employed in the treatment of 
dye-laden water (more than or about 90% removal efficiency). However, pore blo ckage and 
membrane fouling during these processes remain significant limitations [43]. 
In recent times, membrane distillation (MD) technology has emerged as the most desirable and 
effective method for wastewater reclamation. The most important feature of m embrane distillation 
is the ability to pass water vapor  (volatile parts) through the microporous hydrophobic membrane 
Recent Progress in Materials  2022; 4(4), doi:10.21926/ rpm.2204028 
 
Page 5/21 pores and collect  as distillate in a pure form [44]. Some of the benefits offered by MD are the 
significant reduction of equipment size, l ow operating temperature and pressure, low energy 
requirement , and low capital cost. Despite its excellent performance and sought -after method, pore 
wetting , memb rane  fouling , and scaling are the drawbacks encountered , particularly  with the 
membrane distillation method  [45].  
MD processes can be classified into four major configurations depending on the methods to 
induce a vapor pressure difference across the membrane and the type of permeate collection on 
the cold side , summarized in Table  1.  
Table  1 Types of Membrane Distillation (MD) Configuration and advantages and 
disadvantages . 
S.no  Types of Membrane  (MD) 
Configuration  Advantage  Disadvantage  
1 Direct Contact MD (DCMD): Both 
feed and permeate solutions are 
in direct contact with the 
membrane  [46] • High rejection of non -volatile  
• Moderate operating 
temperatures  
• Less sensitive to feed 
concentration  
• Low maintenance and operation 
cost [47] • The cold  feed 
cannot be used as 
a coolant  
• High heat loss by 
conduction [48] 
2 Air Gap MD (AGMD):  
The hot feed solution is in direct 
contact with the hydrophobic 
surface of the membrane , while 
an additional air gap separates 
the permeate side of the 
membrane and a condensation 
surface  [46] • Low conductive heat loss  
• Low membrane wetting  [48] • Low permeate flux  
[48] 
3 Sweeping Gas MD (SGMD):  
A cold sweep gas provides the 
driving force in sweep gas 
membrane distillation  [46] [49] • Reduce conductive heat loss  
[48] • Requires a big 
condenser because 
of the large volume 
of the sweep gas  
[48] 
4 Vacuum MD (VMD):  
Vacuum pressure is applied at the 
permeate side of the membrane 
to collect the vapors, and vapor 
condensation takes place outside 
the membrane module  [50, 51]  • High permeate flux  
• Cost -effective   
• Low thermal and conductive 
heat loss  
• Remove volatile organic 
compounds  [50, 52]  • Susceptible to 
wetting severely 
due to the applied 
vacuum pressure

Page 6/21 1.2 Chemical Methods  
Chemical method of wastewater  treatment includes oxidation , electrolysis , and coagulation -
flocculation methods  [53]. The use of advanced oxidation processes (AOP)  [54] such as ozonation  
[55], ultraviolet/hydrogen peroxide  (UV/H 2O2) [56, 57] , Fenton,  [58, 59]  ultrasound  [60], anodic 
oxidation  [61], and photocatalytic processes  [62] have been efficiently employed to treat dye 
wastewater.  
The coagulation  and flocculation method are physicochemical  treatments  used frequently for 
wastewater treatment  with minimal generation of harmful and toxic intermediates. High molecular 
weights of s urfactants and dyes are successfully removed by the coagulation and flocculation 
processes followed by sedimentation, flotation , and filtration, respectively  [63]. Decolorization  by 
this approach is achieved  by eliminating  dye molecules from dyebath effluents rather than through 
the partial decomposition of dyes, which could generate potentially hazardous and poisonous 
aromatic chemicals  [64]. However, the method has drawbacks , such as the generati on of inherent 
sludge and disposal problems [65]. Table 2 summarizes the different  physical and chemical methods 
used to remove  specific dyes .

1.3 Biological Methods  
Biological treatment  is considered the best method due to its ability to degrade diverse classes 
of dye, less accumulation of harmless sludge,  and a cost -effective  and safer  approach to the disposal  
of textile effluent [81]. Bacterial degradation can occur via bacteria cells , enzymes present in Recent Progress in Materials  2022; 4(4), doi:10.21926/ rpm.2204028 
 
Page 7/21 bacteria , and bacterial consortium , as displayed in Figure  4 [82]. A few  examples of microbes used 
for degrading  various types of dyes have  been given in Table 1.  
 
Figure 4 Various methods for bacterial degradation . 
Azoreductase, laccase , and peroxidase are the enzymes produced by bacteria and have proven 
to be very effective in the degradation of complex dye  molecules , particularly azo dye  [83-85]. The 
microbial degradation of azo dyes to their corresponding amines is initiated by the cleavage of the 
azo linkage  (-N=N -) with an anaerobic azo reductase  [86]. Various Co-enzymes that reduce azo 
linkages are (Flavin M ononucleotide) FMN-independent reductases  [87] and (Nicotinamide Adenine 
Dinucleotide P hosphate) NADPH -dependent reductases  [88]. A colorless solution is obtained by 
reductive cleavage of the azo bond, which is converted into amines and other degraded products in 
the next  step by oxidative cleavage, as depicted in Figure 5 [89].  Therefore, the enzymatic method 
has gained momentum in the last decade as it gives non -toxic end products, produces less sludge 
than other methods, and substantially increases the reaction rate, re quiring much less time [90].  
However, the amount of enzyme production is limited , and they are highly susc eptible to 
undergoing  deactivation by various physical and chemical parameters  [91]. In addition, the method 
is overshadowed by limitations such as space requirements, low removal rate, and inefficiency in 
treating  recalcitrant dye components  [92, 93] .

Recent Progress in Materials  2022; 4(4), doi:10.21926/ rpm.2204028 
 
Page 8/21 Mycoremediation, a biosorption by fungi , holds many benefits in the same way as the microbial 
process. The most widely used fungi in the decolorization  and degradation of dye are the ligninolytic 
fungi of class basidiomycetes  [94-96]. Algae with high surface area and binding  affinity enable the 
removal of dye with high efficiency . Yeast -assisted biosorption is less explored , yet they are found 
to be superior and more sustainable mainly due to their ability to adapt to harsh environmental 
conditions  [97, 98] . It has been studi ed that yeast species like Saccharomyces cerevisiae , 
Saccharomyces uvarum , Saccharomyces lipolytic , and Turolopsis candida  can effectively degrade 
Reactive Brilliant Red K -2BP through biosorption [97]. Various m icroorganism s used for the  
degradation of dye molecule are indicated in Table  3.  
The strong electrostatic force of attraction between the dye and functional groups like carboxyl, 
hydroxyl, phosphate, and other charged groups present in the microbes' cell wall s governs the 
biosorpt ion capacity assisted by microorganisms  [99]. Furthermore, biosorption  efficiency  is 
regulated by parameters like pH, temperature, ionic strength, time of contact, adsorbent and dye 
concentration, dye structure , and type of microorganisms  [100] . Moreover, the rapid growth rate 
of bacteria and simplicity in handling enables the process to be highly  favored  for removing  dye 
from wastewater [101] .

Phytoremediation is an alternative green  approach to biotreating  wastewater c ontaminated 
with heavy metals and organic pollutants  [21, 127] . The primary benefit of dye removal by plants is 
that it is an autotrophic system with large biom ass, which requires little nutrient cost, is easier to 
hand le, and is generally accepted by the public due to its aesthetic demand and environmental 
sustainability  [128, 129] . Although extensive research has been carried out to establish effective 
and efficient phytoremediation techniques for decolorizing and degr ading  azo dyes, large -scale  
application of phytoremediation is not feasible . Presently  it faces several  problems , including the 
extent of pollutants tolerated by the plant  and the requirement of large areas to establish treatment 
plants  [130] . 
The adsorption  technique can be traced back to the 17th century when  the first qualitative studies 
on the uptake of gases by charcoal and clays were reported by C.W. Scheele in 1773. It was followed 
by Lowitz’, who studied using charcoal to decolorize  tartaric acid solutions. Similar phenomena  were 
observed with vegetable animal charcoals by Larvitz in 1792 and Kehl in 1793 , respectively. The 
term ‘adsorption’ was proposed by Bois -Reymond and introduced into the literature by Kayser [131] . 
After that , the adsorption method has been a continuing subject of interest with its wide array  of 
applications  for the removal of solutes from solutions and gases from the air atmosphere  [4]. 
Adsorption  methods involve the movement of a substance from the bulk liquid to the surface of the 
adsorbent  [4]. The substance that accumulates at the interface is called ‘ adsorbate,' and  the solid 
on which adsorption occurs is ‘adsorbent’ [132] . The possible mechanism is due to the interaction 
between azo dye and adsorbent  via electrostatic interaction, hydrogen bonding, functional group 
interaction, π -π interaction, ion exchange, Vander Waals force, hydrophobic interaction , and 
processes such as surface diffusion and intraparticle pore diffusion  as shown in Figure 6 [32, 133] . Recent Progress in Materials  2022; 4(4), doi:10.21926/ rpm.2204028 
 
Page 10/21  
Figure 6 Schematic presentation of the adsorption process . 
Several types of adsorbent materials that have been utilized to remove dye molecules effectively 
from wastewater are metal -organic frameworks  [134] , magnetic nanocomposite [135] , conducting 
polymers  [136] , clay minerals, zeolites [137 ], metal oxides [138] , metal hydroxides  [139] 
biopolymers and agricultural wastes  [140] . Undoubtedly, a universal adsorbent activated carbon is 
the most effective adsorb ent for the treatment of dye from industrial wastewater  [81, 141] . 
Nevertheless, they are still subjected to considerable disadvantages such as cost, energy 
consumption, regeneration , and non -selective to all dyes. Therefore, researchers have made an 
enormous effort and shown keen interest in designing novel adsorbents that are inexpensive, 
sustainable, biodegradable, renewable, and have good surface adsorption characteristics [142].  
The main advantage of the adsorp tion process is the non -generation of toxic secondary pollutants 
compared to other methods , which involve toxic chemicals, high energy consumption , and a highly 
expensive process [143] . 
Recently, the major focus has been shifted to natural adsorbents than synthetic ones since they 
are abundant in nature, low in cost , and require  little processing.  Some of the  promising low-cost 
adsorbents are microorganisms  [144] , agricultural waste  [140] , and naturally occurring industrial 
waste , which  is listed in Figure 7  [145] . The application  of these low -cost adsorbents has benefited 
both water treatment and waste management simultaneously.   
 
Figure 7 Low-cost adsorbents . 
Recent Progress in Materials  2022; 4(4), doi:10.21926/ rpm.2204028 
 
Page 11/21 Along with these , several nanomaterials  have been widely explored for the adsorption of waste 
from textile effl uent [146, 147] . Carbon nanotubes, oxidized  graphene, reduced graphene , boron 
nitride nanosheets , boron carbon nanosheets , etc., have been widely explored as effective 
candidate s for the adsorption  of dyes from wastewater  [148 -150] . 
Along with dyes , various metal ions like Cr (VI), Cd (II), Pb (II) , and Zn (II) , etc., are also present in 
textile wastewater  and pose a serious hea lth hazard ; therefore,  their removal is essential before 
discharge into water. The source of heavy metals in the textile eff luent is various pretreatment, 
dyeing , and finishing steps. In addition , some dyes (like chrome acid dye, reactive and direct metal -
containing  dye) need metal ions for their application  and become an important  source of metal ions 
in textile wastewater  [151] . Various physical and chemical methods like adsorption  [152, 153] , 
coagulation -flocculation  [154, 155] , ion exchange  [155, 156] , membrane separation,  [157]  biological 
treatment  [158] , etc.  can be used for the r emoval of metal ions . Each method has its advantages 
and disadvantages , and the selection of a particular  method depends on the type of metal ions and 
their  concentration.   
2. Conclusions  
The water discharged by the textile  industry is highly polluting  and contains  a variety  of toxic 
metals, chemicals , and dyes. These are hazardous for the aquatic ecosystem and ca use various 
health problems in aquatic animals and human beings. Therefore,  textile effluent  should be treated 
before discharging into a water  body. Various physical, chemical , and biological methods for 
treating  textile effluent were  discussed. All these treatment processes have pros and cons ; 
therefore,  selecting  the most suitable method can be made  based on operational costs and 
sustainability . The physical and chemical methods are highly expensive, require specialized 
instruments and other accessories to operate, and are high in energy consumption.  The chemical 
methods require various other chemicals to treat the chemical waste ge nerated by the textile  
industry. These methods also generat e by-products like solid waste and sludge formation , thereby 
generating  a large  amount of solid waste. Biosorption  offers many  advantages due to its simplicity 
in application, high removal efficiency , and cost -effectiveness . The adsorption method is another 
convenient process owing to its economic feasibility, simplicity of operation, recycling of absorbents, 
sludge -free, and high performance.  Biological methods use microorganisms and their  enzymes  to 
decompose  waste  material generated  by the textile  industry.  These methods are cost -effective and 
eco-friendly, but the efficiency of waste material removal is less than physical and chemical 
methods.  Therefore , there is still scope for future development of  innovative technologies to treat 
colored  wastewater generated from textile dyeing industries.
