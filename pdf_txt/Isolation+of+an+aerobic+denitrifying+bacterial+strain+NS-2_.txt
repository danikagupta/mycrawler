Abstract:  Treatment of micro-polluted source wa ter is receiving increasing attention 
because of environmenta l awareness on a global level. We isolated and identified aerobic 
denitrifying bacteria  Zoogloea sp. N299, Acinetobacter  sp. G107, and Acinetobacter  sp. 81Y 
and used these to remediate samples of their native source water. We first domesticated the isolated strains in the sour ce water, and the 48-h nitrate removal rates of strains N299, 
G107, and 81Y reached 33.69%, 28.28%, and 22.86% , respectively, with no nitrite 
accumulation. We then conducted a source-water  remediation experiment and cultured the 
domesticated strains (each at a dr y cell weight concentration of 0.4 ppm) together  in a sample 
of source water at 20– 26 °C and a dissolved oxygen concen tration of 3–7 mg/L for 60 days. 
The nitrate concentration of th e system decreased from 1.57 ± 0.02 to 0.42 ± 0.01 mg/L  
and that of a control system decreased from 1.63 ± 0.02 to 1.30 ± 0.01 mg/L, each with  
no nitrite accumulation. Total nitrogen of th e bacterial system changed from 2.31 ± 0.12  
to 1.09 ± 0.01 mg/L, while that  of the control system ch anged from 2.51 ± 0.13 to  
1.72 ± 0.06 mg/L. The densities of aerobic denitrification bact eria in the experimental  
and control systems ranged from 2.8 × 10
4 to 2 × 107 cfu/mL and from 7.75 × 103 to  
5.5 × 105 cfu/mL, respectively. The permanganate  index in the experimental and  
control systems decreased from 5.94 ± 0.12 to 3.10 ± 0.08 mg/L and from 6.02 ± 0.13 to 
3.61 ± 0.11 mg/L, respectively, over the course of  the experiment. Next, we supplemented 
samples of the experimental and control systems with additional bacteria or additional OPEN ACCESSInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2015 , 16 8009 
 
 source water and cultivated the systems for another 35 days. The additional bacteria did 
little to improve the water quality. The a dditional source water provided supplemental 
carbon and brought the nitrate removal rate in  the experimental system to 16.97%, while 
that in the control system reached only 3.01% , with no nitrite accumulation in either 
system. Our results show that aerobic den itrifying bacteria remain highly active after 
domestication and demonstrate the applicability of such organisms in the bioremediation of 
oligotrophic ecosystems.

1. Introduction 
Economic and social de velopment has resulted in massive amounts of nitrogenous compounds  
in environmental waters and led to the continuou s deterioration of  aquatic ecosystems [1–5] and 
eutrophication of some reservoirs [6,7], putti ng drinking water sour ces at great risk [5].  Many physical [8], 
chemical [9], and biological methods [10] have been used to remove the nitrogenous compounds and 
purify polluted waters [11]. Biorem ediation has attracted wi de attention because it has lower maintenance 
costs and greater pollutant-removal performance than  other methods [10], for example, remediation of 
uranium [12], toluene [13,1 4], and organic and metal contaminati on [15]. Traditional denitrification 
occurs under anaerobic or anoxic co nditions [16] through a sequence of intermediates (nitrate, nitrite, 
nitric oxide, and nitrous  oxide), finally ending with nitrogen gas [17–19]. 
The reaction steps that use nitrate or  nitrite as terminal electron acce ptors are inhibited by oxygen [20]. 
Paracoccus pantotrophus , first isolated by Robertson and Ku enen [21] and later renamed as Thiosphaera 
pantotropha , is an aerobic denitrifier that has been studied to the greatest extent. There have been recent 
reports of aerobic denitrifying ba cteria isolated from canals [22] , soils [23], ponds [24], activated 
sludge [25], and lakes [26] that can simultaneously  utilize oxygen and nitrate as electron acceptors. 
Most of the isolated  strains, such as T. pantotropha [27], Alcaligenes faecalis [25,28,29], Pseudomonas 
stutzeri [22], Pseudomonas putida [23,30], Pseudomonas mendocina [24], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [31], 
Citrobacter diversus [32], and Bacillus subtilis [33,34], have been used to  treat wastewater [25]. 
Patureau  et al.  [35] proposed a more integrated configur ation for nitrogen and phosphorus removal 
through the introduction of an aerobic denitrifier in to a complex phosphorus /nitrifying ecosystem. 
Barak  et al.  [36] concluded that Pseudomonas denitrificans  is capable of combined phosphate and 
nitrate removal without the need for alternati ng anaerobic/aerobic or an aerobic/anoxic switches.  
Joo et al.  [25] found that P. denitrificans  removed more than 65% of the ammonia from polluted water and 
showed that one strain performed he terotrophic nitrification a nd aerobic denitrification in piggery wastewater. 
However, these strains might have acclimation probl ems in eutrophic freshwater reservoirs because 
of the relatively low nitrate and a mmonium concentrations and low ca rbon levels, which could limit the 
denitrification process [37]. Indigeno us strains that can perform aerobic  denitrification in micro-polluted 
reservoir water would help to overcome this problem. 
Aerobic denitrifiers are rarely isolat ed from reservoirs [26,38], and ther e is little or no research to date 
on the use of aerobic denitrifiers to denitrify and bior emediate reservoir ecosystems. Several studies have Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2015 , 16 8010 
 
 illustrated the difficulties in removing nitrogen from source waters because of the relatively low 
concentrations of nitrogen as a po llutant [39,40]. We studied the effect s of aerobic den itrifiers on water 
quality, and some of our previous findings have been reported elsewhere [41–45]. The objective of this 
study was to determine the phylogenetic affiliation of three strains of indigenous  aerobic denitrifiers  
by using 16S rRNA sequencing and to assess the ni trogen removal performan ce of these strains in 
micro-polluted reservoir water. 
2. Results 
2.1. Identification and Phylogenetic Analys is of Three Aerobic Denitrifiers 
Three gram-negative, oligotrophic aerobic denitrif ying bacterial strains were isolated, submitted to 
GenBank, and identified as Zoogloea  sp. N299, Acinetobacter  sp. G107, and Acinetobacter  sp. 81Y 
(Table 1). The sizes of  the three strains were  approximately 0.5–1 μm × 1.5–3 μm, 0.5–1 μm × 1–1.5 μm, 
and 0.5–1 μm × 2–8 μm (Figure 1). Figure 2 shows the neighbor-j oining phylogenetic tree prepared using 
partial 16S rRNA gene sequences from strains N299, G107, and 81Y, type culture strains and other 
previously studied aerobic denitrifiers. On the ba sis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences, st rain N299 
clustered with species from Zoogloea  and strains G107 and 81Y cl ustered with species from  Acinetobacter .

bootstrap values of 1000 replications. 
2.2. Gradient Domestication 
Strains N299, G107, a nd 81Y were adapted to the source water environment by gradient 
domestication, which lasted 12 days . The nitrate removal rates of N2 99, G107, and 81Y during the 100% 
source-water domestication experime nt were 33.69%, 28.28% , and 22.86%, respectively, in 48 h, and  
no nitrite was accumulated in the cultures (Figures 3 and 4). The densities of the three strains in the 
source water at the end of  the domestication was 106~7 cfu/mL, providing a good preparation for the 
subsequent experi ments (Table 2). Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2015 , 16 8012

2.3. Dissolved Oxygen Concentratio n and Temperature in the Source Water Denitrification Experiment 
In the 60-day source water denitrification experiment, the temperature of the experimental system and 
the control system was 20–27 °C, and the dissolved oxygen concentra tion (DOC) of the two systems was 
maintained at 3–7 mg/L (Figure 5). 
2.4. Nitrate and Total Nitrogen Concentrations in  the Source Water Denitrification Experiment 
Nitrate and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations in the source water in the experimental system and 
control system reached a stable state after 30 days, wh ich lasted until the end of  the 60-day experiment 
(Figures 6 and 7). In the first 30 days, nitrate concen tration in the experimental system decreased from G107 N299 81Y0204060801000.4S+0.6Cc Nitrate removal rate

2.5. Nitrite, Permangana te Index, and Bacterial Dens ities in the Source  Water Denitrific ation Experiment 
As shown in Figure 8, n itrite concentration in the experimental  system increased from 0.07 ± 0.01 to 
0.59 ± 0.01 mg/L in 15 days and then  decreased to 0.03 ± 0.00 mg/L, wh ile that in the control system 
increased from 0.08 ± 0.01 to 0 .55 ± 0.01 mg/L and then decreased to  0 ± 0.00 mg/L. The permanganate 
index (COD Mn) in the experimental system decreased from 5.94 ± 0.12 to  3.10 ± 0.08 mg/L, while that 
in the control system decreased from  6.02 ± 0.13 to 3.61 ± 0.11 mg/L. The density of aerobic denitrifying 
bacteria in the experimental system was higher than that in  the control system, part icularly at day 50  
when the density in the experime ntal system reached 4.36 × 108 cfu/mL and that in the control system 
was 1.87 × 106 cfu/mL. 
2.6. Experiment with Supplemental Bacteria 
The temperature of the experimental and cont rol systems was 26–28 °C over the course of the 
experiment. At the end of the 35-day experiment, the system supplemented with additional bacteria contained 0.5 mg/L nitrate, 0 mg/L  nitrite, and ~1.0 mg/L TN (Tab les 3 and 4). The control system 
contained ~1.5 mg/L nitrate at the end of the experi ment, and the nitrate removal rate was less than 
20%, which was consistent with th e previous control system. There was no nitrite detected in the 
control system, and the TN removal rate was about 20%. 0 1 02 03 04 05 06 00.00.40.81.21.62.02.42.8aTN concentration (mg/L)

2.7. Supplemental Carbon Experiment 
Nitrate concentration in the experimental system  dropped from 1.42–1.18 mg /L, while that in the 
control system dropped from 1.63–1. 58 mg/L (which was essentially un changed; Figure 9). At the end 
of the 35-day experiment, the nitrate removal rate in the experimental system was 16.97%, while that 
in the control system was 3.01%. Afte r 10 days, nitrite levels  in the two systems were both very low, at 
0.02 mg/L or less (Figure 10a). The COD Mn in the experimental system  decreased from 3.3–2.17 mg/L, and 
that in the control system decreased from 3.57–2.22 mg/L  (Figure 10b). The temper ature of the cultures 
ranged from 22–11 °C, an d the DOC was 3.8–7.3 mg/L (Figure 10c,d).

3. Discussion 
Through enrichment and domestication of reservoir sediments, total organic carbon (TOC) of the final 
system was almost 13 mg/L. Then, the aerobic denitrifying bacter ia were domesticated [45] by a series of 
transfers through the following me dia concentrations: 10 0% culture medium (SM medium, ~30 mg/L 
carbon source), 80% culture medium + 20% source  water (~25.2 mg/L carbon source), 60% culture 
medium + 40% source water (~20.4  mg/L carbon source),  40% culture medium + 60% source water  
(~15.6 mg/L carbon so urce), 20% culture medium + 80% source water (~10.8 mg/L ca rbon source), and 
100% source water (~6 mg/L carbon source), according to Kuznetaov  et al.  [46]. Kuznetaov  et al.  defined 
oligotrophic bacteria that could fi rst survive in a medium with 1–15 mg/L carbon source. Therefore, the 
isolated aerobic denitrifiers were oligotrophic bact eria. The three aerobic den itrification bacteria, N299, 
G107, and 81Y, had good nitr ogen removal ability and were used to remediate reservoir source water. 
Through gradient domestication in s ource water, the aerobic  denitrifiers could adapt to the source 
water environment.  All three strains showed good denitrificati on characteristics, which was consistent 
with the results of our previous  studies [45]. The nitr ate removal rates of N299, G107, and 81Y were 
33.69%, 28.28%, and 22.86%, re spectively, in 48 h. Zhou  et al.  [45] showed that  after 72 h of 
cultivation in raw water, the nitrate and total nitrogen removal rates of  two strains of aerobic 0 1 02 03 04 00.00.40.81.21.62.0aNitrite concentration (mg/L)

 denitrifying bacteria were  30%–40% and 20%–25%, respectively. Af ter domestication, the bacteria in 
our experiment reached densities of 106 cfu/mL, which were then used  to remediate source water. 
Addition of the three aerobic denitrifying strains to the source water increased the rates of nitrite 
and nitrate reduction, indicating good de nitrification performance. Because nitrite is an intermediate of 
nitrification and denitrifi cation, changes in nitrite levels in the system reflect nitrogen cycling by the 
bacteria. The nitrate level decreased while the nitrite  level increased in a short period in the control 
system; this indicated that there was a certain number of denitrifying bacteria in the system, which is consistent with the findings of Carter  et al.  [47]. However, the denitrif ication performance of the 
system containing the three domesticated denitrifyi ng strains was superior to that of the control 
system. The nitrogen in the control system could not  be converted into its gaseous form and, hence, 
could not be removed completely. It was only converted to nitrite and then  oxidized to nitrate, and thus it 
maintained a stable state until the end of the experime nt. Previous studies have shown that most aerobic 
denitrifiers are able to denitrify at  a DOC of less than 3 mg/L [48]. The strains used in our study could 
tolerate a high DOC of 3–7 mg/L, which is consis tent with the findings of  our previous study [44]. 
We evaluated the effect of bact erial growth of the aerobic deni trifying bacteria by using plate 
counts [44]. In addition, the nitrogen removal perf ormances of the bacteria and the control system 
reflected the effect of bacterial growth in the experiment. The dens ity of aerobic denitrifying bacteria 
in the experimental system was significantly higher th an that in the control system, indicating that the 
domesticated aerobic denitrifiers persisted in th e source water environment and maintained their 
denitrification abilities. The TN removal rate in the experimental system averaged 50%, while that  
in the control system was 20%–30%. There were a certain number of denitrifying bacteria in the 
natural system, which is consiste nt with the findings of Carter  et al.  (in a sediment system) [47],  
Zhang  et al.  (in canal systems) [22], Kim  et al.  (in soil systems) [23], Zhu  et al.  (in pond systems) [24], 
Joo et al.  (in an activated sl udge system) [25], Guo  et al.  (in lake systems)  [26], and Huang  et al.  (in a 
reservoir system) [44,45,49]. Therefor e, the TN removal rate in the co ntrol system also  reached 20%–30%. 
In addition, the COD removal rate wa s higher in the experimental syst em than in the control system. 
Liu et al.  [26] showed that the TN d ecreased slightly when a carbon source was added to the source 
water at a C/N ratio of 4, mainly due to the e xhaustion of the carbon source. In a similar study,  
Xu et al.  [24] showed that the TN removal rate reached 85% in filtered source water. Wei  et al.  [41] 
reported a TN removal rate of ~40% in source water over 60 days. Xu  et al.  [24] examined the ability 
of an aerobic denitrifier ( Pseudomonas mendocina  3–7) isolated from the Hua-jia-Chi Pond in China 
to remediate polluted drinking water by performing experiments in different modified DM media, 
although the strain was not tested in real source wa ter. Overall, the results of our study and those of 
previous studies suggest that biological agents can remediate source water environments, reduce the 
environmental impacts of industry and society, and have enormously va luable applications. 
The experiment with supplemental bacteria was de signed to investigate whether the addition of 
bacteria could reduce the concentrat ions of nitrogen or other nutrien ts and further purify the water. 
Because of the lack of a carbon source in the system, addition of bacteria did no t further remove 
contaminants and purify the source water. The s upplemental carbon experiment was designed to 
investigate whether the aerobic den itrifying bacteria were still hi ghly active by adding more source 
water, which simulated a real reservoir environmen t. The nitrate concentration in the system that 
received the supplemental carbon showed a significan t downward trend, while that in the control Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2015 , 16 8020 
 
 system did not change. Because the temperature of the experiment was not controlled, the temperature 
decreased from 21.9–11.4 °C over the course of th e experiment. The denitrification process was 
sensitive to the temperature, and the denitrifi cation rate doubled with every 4 °C increase in 
temperature [50]. Temperature was an important f actor, which could have affected the enzymatic 
activity of aerobic denitrification bacteria [51]. Because of the low temperature, the nitrogen removal 
rater was not obvious. However, th e data showed that the previously added aerobic denitrifying 
bacteria were still active. The rate of COD Mn degradation in the supplemen tal carbon system was faster 
than that in the control system, which indicated the heterotrophic characte ristics of the flora. 
4. Experimental Section 
4.1. Samples 
Surface sediments (depth = 0–10 cm) and water sa mples were collected from an oligotrophic 
reservoir ecosystem (location: 34°56'38.74''N, 117°41'14.13''E) in June 2011 by using a sterilized 
Petersen stainless steel grab sample r [49]. The samples were stored in  black plastic bags at 4 °C and 
transferred to the Key Laborator y of Northwest Water Resource,  Environment and Ecology, Xi’an 
University of Architecture and Technology (Xi’an, China). 
4.2. Enrichment Cultures and Isolati on of the Aerobic Denitrifiers 
A 100-mL stored sediment sample  was added to 700 mL of the en richment denitrification broth  
(in g·L−1: 0.5 CH 3COONa, 0.1 NaNO 3, 0.1 K 2HPO 4·3H 2O, 0.05 CaCl 2, 0.05 MgCl 2·6H 2O;  
pH 7.2) [43,49]. Every three days , the medium concentration was reduced by 10% by removing some of 
the volume and replacing it with an equal volume of water. Enrichment and domestication of the 
aerobic denitrifiers lasted almost  a month [51]. The enrichment se diment suspension was sampled via 
gradient dilution in triplicate. The gradient dilutions were as follows: 10−1 dilution (1 mL enrichment 
sludge suspension added to 9 mL  sterile distilled water), 10−2 dilution (1 mL·10−1 dilution suspension 
added to 9 mL sterile distilled water), 10−3 dilution (1 mL·10−2 dilution suspension added to 9 mL 
sterile distilled water), 10−4 dilution (1 mL 10−3 dilution suspension added to 9 mL sterile distilled 
water), 10−5 dilution (1 mL 10−4 dilution suspension added to 9 mL steril e distilled water), 10−6 dilution  
(1 mL 10−5 dilution suspension adde d to 9 mL sterile di stilled water), and 10−7 dilution (1 mL 10−6 dilution 
suspension added to 9 mL sterile di stilled water). The diluents were streaked on a solid screening 
medium (in g·L−1: 0.1 CH 3COONa, 0.02 NaNO 3, 0.02 K 2HPO 4·3H 2O, 0.01 CaCl 2, 0.01 MgCl 2·6H 2O, 
20 agar; pH 7.2) [41] and incubated at 30 °C. Prominent single colonies were harvested and subsequently 
cultivated in SM medium (in g·L−1: 0.1 CH 3COONa, 0.02 NaNO 3, 0.02 K 2HPO 4·3H 2O, 0.01 CaCl 2,  
0.01 MgCl 2·6H 2O, pH 7.2) with NaNO 3 as the sole nitrogen source in order to assess the performance of 
the aerobic denitrifying bacteria. Th ree isolated strains (N299, G107 , and 81Y) with high nitrogen 
removal performance were obtained and stored on SM slants at 4 °C and on Glycerin SM at −20 °C. 
4.3. Analysis of 16S rRNA Gene Sequences 
We performed polymerase chai n reaction (PCR) by using the following primers [52]:  
7F 5'-CAGAGTTGATCCTGGCT-3' and 1540R 5'-A GGAGGTGATCCAGCCGCA-3'. The PCR mix Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2015 , 16 8021 
 
 consisted of 2.5 μL 5× buffer (with Mg2+), 0.5 μL template, 2.5 mM of each dNTP, 0.2 μL Taq DNA 
polymerase, and sterile nuclease- free water (total volume, 25 μL). The PCR was performed as follows: 
4 min at 94 °C, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 45 s, ann ealing at 55 °C for 15 s, 
and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. After a final ex tension at 72 °C for 10 min, the reaction mixtures 
were held at 4 °C. We screened  the sequences for homology with th e sequences in GenBank by using 
BLAST (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). A phylogenetic tree was constructed with the MEGA 
5.0 program using the neighbor-j oining method with 1000 bootstrap replicates and the maximum 
composite likelihood model. 
4.4. Domestication of the Aerobic Denitrifiers in the Source Water 
The three isolated aerobic denitrifying bacteria we re inoculated into 50 mL liquid SM medium in 
separate 100 mL Erlenmeyer flasks and cultu red for 24 h at 30 °C and 120 rpm. The aerobic 
denitrifying bacteria were then domesticated [45] by a series of transfers through the following  
media concentrations: 100% culture medium (SM medium), 80% culture  medium + 20% source water,  
60% culture medium + 40% source  water, 40% culture medium + 60% source water, 20% culture 
medium + 80% source water, and 100% source wate r. Each gradient domestication medium was 
sterilized at 121 °C for 30 min prio r to inoculation. We cultured the st rains in 150 mL liquid medium in 
250-mL Erlenmeyer flasks. We inoculated new cultu re media by 10% volumetric dilution every 48 h. 
We measured the nitrate and nitrite concentrations  of the media to evalua te the performance of 
domestication. At the end of domestication, we measured the growth ability of the strains by 
performing plate counts [41] after 5 days of gr owth at 30 °C in solid SM medium (in g·L−1:  
0.1 CH 3COONa, 0.02 NaNO 3, 0.02 K 2HPO 4·3H 2O, 0.01 CaCl 2, 0.01 MgCl 2·6H 2O, 20 agar; pH 7.2). 
We determined the dry cell weight (DCW) of the cultures by weighing cell pellets. 
4.5. The 60-Day Source Water Denitrification Experiment 
The experiment was performed in a 20-L bottle wi th a black plastic bag on the outer wall to 
simulate the darkness of the reservoir environmen t. DOC of the system was controlled using an 
aeration pump (Songbao, Zongshan, China). The system  was maintained at room temperature.  
The three strains (N299, G107, and 81Y) after gradient  domestication were adde d to the experimental 
system at 0.4 ppm (2 mL/20 L). Ni trate, nitrite, TN, COD, and aerob ic denitrifying bacterial colonies 
were measured. All parameters were measured in tr iplicate. Nitrate, nitrite,  and TN were measured 
every 5 days, and COD Mn and number of colonies were measured every 10 days. 
4.6. Experiment with Supplemental Bacteria 
At the end of the 60-day source water denitrifica tion experiment, we supplemented samples of the 
systems with bacteria to investigate whether adding bacteria could further purify the water. We added 
0.4 ppm each of the three domesticated denitrifying bacteria to 5-L samples of the water from the 
previous 60-day experiment and from the contro l system. The 5-L bottles were wrapped in black 
plastic bags to simulate the darkness of the reserv oir environment and incubate d at 30 °C for 35 days. Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2015 , 16 8022 
 
 DOC was not controlled. Nitrate and nitrite  were measured every 5 days, and COD Mn was measured 
every 10 days. 
4.7. Supplemental Carbon Experiment 
At the end of the 60-day source water denitrif ication experiment, we performed a supplemental 
carbon experiment to investigate whether the aerobi c denitrifying bacteria were still highly active.  
We added 5 L of water from the 60-day experiment  and 15 L of fresh source water to 20-L bottles 
wrapped in black plastic bags to si mulate the darkness of the reservoi r environment. Nitrate and nitrite 
and COD Mn were measured to reflect the experimental re sults. Nitrate and nitrite were measured every 
5 days, and COD Mn was measured every 10 days. 
4.8. Data Analysis 
The optical density of the culture broth was measured at 600 nm (OD 600) by using a 
spectrophotometer (DR6000; HACH Co mpany, Loveland, CO, USA) [53] . The nitrite concentration was 
determined by using N-(1-naphthalene)-diaminoethane photometry [54]. The TN and nitrate 
concentrations were measured by usi ng hydrochloric acid phot ometry [54]. COD Mn was analyzed 
using the potassium permanganate method [44]. DCW was determined by weighing  the cell pe llet after 
5-mL samples of the broth cultures (SM medium) we re dried in an oven at 105 °C for 12 h [53].  
We used a scanning electron micros cope (S-3400N; Hitach i, Tokyo, Japan). The densities of aerobic 
denitrifying bacteria in the cultures were measur ed by plate counts [40]. DOC and temperature were 
measured using HQ30d (HACH Company, Loveland, CO , USA). The samples of nitrate and nitrite 
were filtered using a 0.45- μm cellulose-acetate filter to remove the bacteria. 
5. Conclusions 
Through enrichment and domestica tion, three oligotrophic aerobic de nitrification bacteria were 
obtained. On the basis of their 16S rRNA sequences , the aerobic denitrifiers  were identified as 
Zoogloea  sp. N299, Acinetobacter  sp. G107, and Acinetobacter  sp. 81Y. During the source-water 
gradient domestication, the three strains gradually ad apted to the source water environment, suggesting 
that we can optimize domestication strategies to im prove source-water denitrif ication capacity and the 
ability to adapt to a source of water in orde r to bioremediate micro-polluted source water. 
The bacteria displayed strong denitrification charact eristics during the 60 days  in the source water. 
The nitrate concentration in the source water in th e experimental system d eclined by at least 70%, 
while that in the control system declined by only  20%. There was no accumulation of nitrite in the 
system. In the subsequent experiment in which a dditional bacteria were added, there was no apparent 
difference between the experimental and control systems because of the lack of carbon. In the 
extension experiment in which additional car bon-containing source water was added, the nitrate 
removal rate in the experimental system reached 16.97% after 35 days, wh ile that in the control system 
reached only 3.01%; this indicated that some aerobic denitrifying bacteria still survived in the source 
water from the 60-day experiment and maintained strong denitrification capabilities. The results 
support further experiments to characterize the biorem edial potential of aerobic denitrifying bacteria in Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2015 , 16 8023 
 
 source water. In order to better simulate the reservoir environment, experiments under additional 
sediment conditions should be performed. 
We used a series of domesticati on and source-water experiments to  show the feasibility of using 
aerobic denitrifying bacteria to bi oremediate micro-polluted source water, suggestin g a new way to 
reduce the environmental pollution load.
