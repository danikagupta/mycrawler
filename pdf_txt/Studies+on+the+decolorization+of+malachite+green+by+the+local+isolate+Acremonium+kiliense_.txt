Abstract—The increasing presence of dyes represents a major 
environmental toxicity hazard; therefore, finding and 
development of new methods for dye removal from waste water 
has generated significant interest . Chemical, physical and 
electrochemical methods have limited use as they have many 
disadvantages compared with the biological methods. The aim of 
this study was to test the effects of immobilization and some 
culture conditions on decolorization of methylene blue and 
malachite green by Desmodesmus  sp. isolated from local 
environment. Decolorization of dyes by free and immobilized 
Desmodesmus  sp. was tested by monitoring the decrease in 
absorbance of each dye under different culture condition such as 
incubation time and dye concentrations. The results showed that 
the maximum decolorization of both dyes with immobilized 
algae after 6 days at 20 mg.L-1 of dye concentration with 98.6%. 
The results showed that there was decolorization ability of 
immobilized Desmodesmus  sp. against the dyes compared with 
free one. The analysis of the results showed that there was 
different factors affect ed decolorization abili ty.

I. INTRODUCTION  
The estimated number of the synthetic dyes on the market 
are more than 100,000, with annual production over 700,000 
tons worldwide. These dyes are used in paper industry, textile, 
cosmetics, food and pharmaceutical industries. Furthermore, 
some dyes are dangerous to cells and living organisms due to 
their  potential mutagenicity, toxicity and carcinogenicity 
[1]-[3].   
Methylene blue (MB) and malachite green (MG) are 
widely used dyes.  Both dyes have been reported for their 
negative impact on living cells and organisms. The oral 
median lethal dose (LD 50) of methylene blue and malachite 
green in rats has been estimated as 1180 and 275 mg.kg-1, 
respectively [4], [5]. It was also found tha t at low and 
moderate doses of MB arterial blood pressure increased, 
whereas at high doses it will worsen systemic hypotension, 
mycocardardial depression and hypertension after 
endotoxemia [6]. MG has been reported to cause 
carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, chr omosomal fracture, 
teratogenicity, and respiratory toxicity  [7], [8]. 
Conventional methods such as chemical precipitation, 
chemical coagulation, chemical oxidation and adsorption 
have limited use as they are cost-intensive and generate large 
amounts of solid waste, resulting in higher pollution potential 
than the effluents [9]-[11], and these methods are usually

al_fawwaz@aabu.edu.jo , mufidak101282@yahoo.com ). effective only if the effluent volume is small [12] . In such 
cases, biological processes are good alternatives for dye 
removal [9], [13]. 
In recent years, several studies have focused on some 
microorganisms for the removal of synthetic dyes from 
aqueous solutions, wastewater and industrial effluents. The 
process is relatively inexpensive, the running costs are low 
and the end products of complete mineralization are not toxic 
[9], [14]. Different microorganisms have been tested for the 
decolorization dyes such as heterotrophic bacteria, for 
instance Escherichia coli  [15] and Pseudomonas luteola  [16] ; 
molds, for example Aspergillus niger  [17] , Aspergillus 
terricola  [18]; yeasts, like  Saccharomyces cerevisiae , 
Candida tropicalis, C. lipolytica  [19]; and algae, like 
Spirogyra species [20] , Lemna minuscule  [21], and 
Cosmarium  sp. [9], [22] . Among all these potential 
biosorbents, algae have received considerable interest 
because they are locally available and cost effective.  
However, few studies have investigated the efficiency of 
fresh algae to decolorize dye effluents. The objectives of this 
study were to investigate the effects of immobilization and 
some cultural conditions (incubation time and dye 
concentration) to decolorize methylene blue and malachite 
green dyes using fresh green algae ( Desmodesmus  sp.) as 
biosorbent. 
 
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS  
A. Microalgal Culture  
Green microalgae were obtained from the banks of water 
stream originating from water spring located at Ajloun area in 
north Jordan in May, 2012 (location : 32°24'02.86 "N, 
35°41'37.38 "E). The samples were collected in clean and 
sterile glass bottles and transferred to the laboratory for 
isolation.  
B. Isolation, Cultivation and Classification of Microalgae 
Green microalgal samples were cultivated in flasks (1L) 
containing 600 mL Bold Basal Medium (BBM). Isolation of 
algal colonies was carried out by a series of subcultures on 
BBM agar plates. Once algal colonies were separated, a pure 
culture was prepared and microscopically examined. Pure 
strains were then cultivated on BBM agar slants and stored in 
refrigerator. Routine cultivation was carried out at 25° C under 
light intensity of 20.25 μE m-2 S-1 for 15 days. A pure culture 
was chosen and was identified by University of Texas culture 
collection, Utex CC, USA as Desmodesmus  sp.

D. Experimental Setup  
Decolorization of MB and MG dyes was determined 
spectrophotometrically. The absorbance was measured with 
spectrophotometer (UV/Vis spectrophotometer WPA light 
wave S2000) at two different wavelengths depending on the 
dye: 660 nm for abiotic control solutions or free and 
immobilized dye aqueous Solutions containing MB, and 619 
nm for abiotic control solutions or free and immobilized dye 
aqueous Solutions containing MG. Microalgal cells and 
alginate beads were removed from cultures by centrifugation 
at 6700 rpm for 10 min and the absorbance of cell-free 
supernatant was measured at the corresponding wavelength. 
The experiments were incubated at 25 °C and inoculums 
concentration of 0.25 g.L-1. The initial solution pH was 6.8 for 
both dyes. The percentage of dye removed was calculated 
using the following equation: 
Removal (%) =

100if
iCC
C
 
where Ci is the initial concentration of dye (mg.L-1) and Cf is 
the concentration of dye after a period of time. Decolorization 
was determined based on an absorbance calibration curve of 
known standard solutions.  
In immobilization experiments the difference in dye 
concentration between blank beads and beads with 
microalgae were considered, and decolorization percentage 
of immobilization experiments will be as the following 
equation: 
Immobilization Removal (%) 
=

100i t i blank
iC C C C
C 
 
where Ct is the concentration of dyes after decolorization by 
algal beads, Cblank is the concentration of dyes after 
decolorization by blank beads (mg.L-1) after a period of time.  E. Immobilization of Microalgae (Desmodesmus sp.) 
Immobilization of algae cells in sodium alginate solution 
were prepared by the method described by [23]. To 
immobilize the algae in alginate matrix via entrapment, 3% 
sodium alginate solution was mixed with 0.25 g.L-1 dry 
weight algal suspension to give 2:1 v:v alginate to algal 
suspension ratio. To create blank alginate beads (without 
algae), 3% sodium alginate was mixed with deionized water. 
The 3% alginate-algae mixture or alginate suspension was 
then introduced drop wise (8-10 cm away of CaCl 2 solution) 
into 0.03 M CaCl 2 to produce the beads. The beads started to 
harden almost immediately when dropped into the CaCl 2 
solution and were left in the solution overnight to fully harden. 
The beads were then washed three times in deionized water 
and stored at 4◦C if not used immediately. Fig. 2 illustrates the 
beads produced.  
Experiments were conducted in triplicates and the 
experimental data represents the mean of the ±  standard 
deviations.

III. RESULTS  
Contact time is an important parameter to determine the 
optimum time of decolorization process. Decolorization 
studies were carried out for 8 days and it was observed that the 
removal of MB was found to increase rapidly by free and 
immobilized algae in the first 2 and 4 days, respectively (Fig. 
3). MB removal reached 64.4 and 98.4 % by free and 
immobilized algae, respectively. The same trend was 
observed in both states (free and immobilized); MB removal 
efficiency became stable after the first 4 days for immobilized 
treatment and after the first 2 days for free treatment.

The effect of contact time on the amount of malachite green 
by free and Immobilized Desmodesmus  sp. was investigated. 
Fig. 4 shows that the best removal efficiency of M.G was after 
4 days with 88.9 % when  Desmodesmus  sp. in alginate beads International Journal of Environmental Science and Development, Vol. 7, No. 2, February 2016
96  
was used as biosorbent. Free state of Desmodesmus  sp. shows 
less M.G removal efficiency compared with immobilized one, 
the best removal efficiency of M.G was after 8 days with 
57.4 % when  Desmodesmus  sp. was used in the free state.      
For both dyes immobilized  Desmodesmus  sp. shows the 
best decolorization efficiency compared with the free state 
and it happen in the 2-4 days of contact.

efficiency by free and Immobilized Desmodesmus  sp. 
 
The effect of immobilization with initial dye concentration 
of both dyes was also investigated (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6). As 
noted in  Fig. 5 methylene blue removal efficiency decreases 
as dye concentration increased and the best decolorization of 
methylene blue was at 5 mg.L-1 with 95.7 % compared with 
71.6 % at 20 mg.L-1 when Desmodesmus  sp. was used in 
immobilized state. The same trend was observed when 
Desmodesmus  sp. was used in the free state with 97.5 and 
56.8 % at 5 and 20 mg.L-1, respectively.

Fig. 6. Effects of dye concentration (mg.L-1) on malachite green removal 
efficiency by free and immobilized Desmodesmus  sp.  Results obtained in Fig. 6 shows that dye removal 
efficiency slightly increases as initial malachite green 
increased when Desmodesmus  sp. was used in immobilized 
state and the maximum removal efficiency was 89.1% at 
20mg.L-1 compared with 63.2% at 5 mg.L-1. There was no 
significant difference in decolorization efficiency of 
malachite green when Desmodesmus  sp. was used as free 
state.  
Fig. 7 shows the different treatments in immobilization 
experiments, there was slightly decrease in MB color after 6 
days when blank beads was used as biosorbents (Fig. 7B) 
compared with clear solution when immobilized 
Desmodesmus  sp. was used (Fig. 7C).

IV. DISCUSSION  
Dyes are widely used in many fields, for instance in textile 
industry and in biology in a number of biological staining 
procedures. Methylene blue and malachite green are good 
examples which are used in many fields and also have a wide 
variety of toxicological effects [6], [7], [24]. Removal of 
these dyes from wastewater and contaminated sites is of major 
concern due to biological, environmental, and aesthetic 
reasons. Therefore, several studies were conducted to 
decolorize such these dyes from the environment [25], [26], 
[22]. In this study, one strains of green microalgae were 
isolated, Desmodesmus  sp. from water stream habitats. The 
ability of Desmodesmus  strain to remove MB and MG from 
aqueous solutions in both states (free and immobilized) was 
examined. Free and immobilized states of Desmodesmus  were 
able to decolorize methylene blue and malachite green from 
aqueous solutions with high capacity reaches 98. 3 % dye 
removal. However, decolorization was dependent on several 
factors including initial dye concentration, contact time and 
immobilization. 
Generally, cell walls of green algae are made up of 
cellulose as the main structural polysaccharide, lipids, and 
proteins. Extracellular polymers of algal cell wall consist of 
surface functional groups such as hydroxyl, carbonyl and 
carboxyl groups, which provide binding sites and enhance 
sorption of the dye molecules onto the surface of the polymer 
during decolorization process[27], [28]. 
In the present investigation, Desmodesmus  sp. significantly 
reduced MB and MG color from dye aqueous solutions in 
both free and immobilized conditions. Both conditions were 
relatively rapid in MB and MG dye removal. More than 
70.7% removal of color was recorded in all the treatment with 
the incubation period of 8 days; though the immobilized cells 
performed well over free cells (Fig. 3 and Fig . 4). The highest 
removal percentage was observed in the first 2 days. The 
results show that the decolorization of dyes was increased International Journal of Environmental Science and Development, Vol. 7, No. 2, February 2016
97  
with time up to 2-4 days. However, the rate of dye 
decolorization was quite slow after day 4. One possible 
explanation is that all binding sites became occupied on the 
algal biomass after the first d days, which exerted elevated 
toxicity on the algal biomass. The time dependant experiment 
showed that the initial two hour was significant for dyes 
decolorization and results were agreed by earlier workers [26], 
[29], [30]. In both condition, experiments were performed 
until 2-4 days min beyond which the removal rate of the 
microalgae became stable. The immobilized beads used with 
both dyes proved to be more efficient on dye decolorization 
than free biomass (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4). This observation 
suggested that decolorization increased with increasing time 
as agreed by previous worker [31]. They stated that the 
maximum time is (not exceeding seven days) an ideal way to 
reduce the color from the dye wastewater. Reference [32] 
reported a 95.4% MG decolorization in 72 hours using the 
filamentous fungus Acremonium kiliense.  In other study by 
[33], Aspergillus flavus  and Alternaria solani  were able of 
MG removal with a decolrization percentage of 97.43% and 
96.91%, respectively, in 6 days.  
Immobilization of algae as beads is a very efficient method 
of cell entrapment because it allow high cell loading and are 
translucent to light. Also it can be used many times in 
photobioreactors [25], [26]. Alginate is the most frequent 
polymer used for algal immobilization. Many authors 
reported that microalgae is a common and effective species 
for the immobilization and adsorption purposes [34]-[36], 
[26]. The biosorption capacity of algae is attributed to their 
relatively high surface area and high binding affinity [37]. 
The decolorization of present study ( Desmodesmus  sp.; 
95.8%) were quietly high compared to other workers [38] has 
been dealt with marine species ( Lyngbya  sp.; 46.3%). Studies 
have adequately verified cell viability in the alginate matrix 
[39]. In a freely suspended algal treatment system, the 
removal efficiency is often directly related to the cell mass. 
Increasing the algal biomass would improve the removal 
efficiency and shorten the retention time [26], [40]. 
The highest removal capacity was observed at initial dye 
concentration 5 mg.L-1 for MB dyes and for both conditions, 
even though a higher concentration (20 mg.L-1) was tested. As 
the dye concentration increased beyond 5 mg.L-1, the removal 
capacity decreased. This can be explained by the binding 
capacity of the algal biomass and/or the toxicity of dyes. High 
surface area and high biding affinity of some functional 
groups as hydroxyl, carboxyl, amino, and phosphate groups 
on the surface of algae are considered to be responsible for 
sequestration of contaminants from wastewater [22]. In Fig. 6 , 
the removal percentage of immobilized algae increased with 
increasing concentration and this may be due to alginat e 
beads which protect algal biomass. On the contrary, 
decolorization of MG by free Desmodesmus  sp. was not 
affected by increasing dye concentration and one possible 
explanation is that algal cells in the flasks were free which 
provide a higher surface area of algae and therefore higher 
number of binding sites leading to higher removal capacity. 
Higher removal capacity may be due to electrostatic 
interactions between the negatively functional groups on the 
algal surface and the positively charged methylene blue and 
malachite green dyes in the flasks [8]. V. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  
From the above discussion it is cleared that Desmodesmus  
sp. in both free and immobilized condition can successfully be 
used as biosorbent to decolorize and reduce the effects of MB 
and MG dyes. Immobilized beads were more efficient in 
decolorization than the free biomass in all treatments. Contact 
time and initial dye concentration affect decolorization 
process. According to the previous results this study highly 
recommends using Desmodesmus  sp. in other bioremediation 
applications for pollutant removal.
