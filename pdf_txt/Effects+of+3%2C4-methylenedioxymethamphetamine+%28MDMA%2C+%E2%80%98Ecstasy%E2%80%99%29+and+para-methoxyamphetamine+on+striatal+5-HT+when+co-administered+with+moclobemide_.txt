3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ‘Ecstasy’) is known to produce 
hyperthermia and adverse cardiovascular effects in humans following consumption, which 
can be life threatening. In animals, MDMA also produces similar effects as seen in human s 
such as  increas e in core body temperature (Tc) which has been linked to chronic 
neurotoxicity. Currently, clinical treatment of these adverse effects is inadequate mainly 
due to limited understanding of the mechanism involved in the acute MDMA -induced 
adverse eff ects. Due to ethical reasons, MDMA studies in humans are limited and studies 
have relied on the use of animal models to investigate MDMA effects. Therefore, it is 
important to assess MDMA -induced effects using appropriate techniques to relate the 
findings from animals to humans.  
 
The general aims of this thesis were to investigate effects of different methods used to 
measure core body temperature and behaviour following MDMA administration and the 
validity of combined telemetry and microdialysis techniques to assess MDMA and its 
active metabolite, 3,4 -methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) effects on body temperature 
(Tc), behaviour, heart rate (HR), locomotor activity (LMA), and 5 -HT extracellular levels  
in the rat striatum.  
 
The first part of this thesis looked at the influence o f methodological approaches used to 
assess changes in core body temperature and behaviour following MDMA administration. 
A number of studies used rectal probe measurement which requires handling and 
restraining of rats which results in confounding effects on the pa rameters measured 
including Tc and behaviour. Telemetry has been developed to measure these behavioural 
parameters without the necessity of handling the rats. The use of rectal probe caused 
potentiation of 10mg/kg (i.p.) MDMA -induced increase in c ore body temperature Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  viii	  compared to the use of telemetry to measure Tc during the first 60 minutes following 
MDMA administration and has also resulted in a lower survival rate. These results 
demonstrate the importance of using appropriate techniques when meas uring these 
parameters to avoid confounding effects and that telemetry provides a more accurate 
assessment of MDMA -induced change in core body temperature.  
 
The second part of the thesis looked at the validity of combined telemetry and 
microdialysis techn iques to investigate effects of systemic administration of MDMA and 
central administration of MDMA and MDA  on Tc, HR, LMA and 5 -HT extracellular 
levels  in the striatum. Systemic administration of  10mg/kg (i.p.)  MDMA produced 
significant increase in  Tc, HR, LMA and 5 -HT extracellular levels  in the striatum whereas 
central administration of 100µM MDMA only produced significant incre ase in 5 -HT 
extracellular levels . Central  administration of 5µM MDA produced no significant changes 
in the parameters measured, which suggests that MDA , at concentration used in this study,  
does not play a major role in MDMA -induced increase in 5 -HT extracellular levels  in the 
striatum and the occurrence of hyperthermia.  
 
In summary, this thesis has dem onstrated that a  combined telemetry and microdialysis 
technique provides a better approach to assess MDMA effects in rats, allowing central 
administration of drugs, and simultaneous measurement of physiological and 
neurochemical parameters. The combined te chniques provided a better tool to investigate 
the effects of MDMA particularly looking at the relationship between the physiological 
and neurochemical effects in animal models.

1.1 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA , ‘Ecstas y’) 
1.1.1 History of origins  
3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ‘ecstasy’) is a psychostimulant drug that 
is used worldwide in raves and dance club s and has becom e increasingly popular in  the last 
three decad es. MDMA is a ring -substi tuted amphetamine deriv ative. MDMA  i s also 
related to mescaline which is a hallucinogenic compound (Hardman et al., 1973; Jonathan 
et al., 1986; Capela et al., 2009)  through its chemical stru cture and is closely related to  
methamphetamine, a psychomotor stimulant (Jonatha n et al., 1986) . As shown in Figure 1, 
these compounds contain structural modifications such as the addition of the methoxy 
group at various positions on the benzene ring and variations in the length and branching 
of the side chain which affect their ph armacological activity (Hardman et al., 1973) . 
 
MDMA was primarily synthesized and patented in Germany in 1912 by Merck 
pharmaceutical as  a precursor agent for therapeutically active compounds and i t was not 
intenti onally developed for its psychostimulant effects  (Green et al., 2003; Freudenmann et 
al., 2006) . The toxicological and behavioral effects of MDMA were first examined in the 
1950s, at the University of Michigan by the USA military (Hardman et al., 1973) . The 
study assessed mean lethal doses of MDMA and other mescaline analogues in five animal 
models , namely  rats, mice, dogs, guinea pigs and monkeys, and found that changes in 
mescaline structure can alter the pharmacological activity of the analogues. The findings 
were not published until 1973 (Hardman et al., 1973; Parrott, 2001) . However, it was not 
until 1978 that Alexander Shulgin, known as the ‘fa ther’ of MDMA (Benzenhofer and 
Passie, 2010)  published the findings about the psychoactive properties of MDMA in 
humans described as  a n “easily controlled altered state of consciousness with emotional 
and sensual overt ones” (Shulgin and Nicho ls, 1978) . From this point , there has bee n Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  2	  research on the  potential  of this drug  in psychotherapy (Greer, 1985)  as it was believed to 
facilitate communication and increase patient self -esteem. During the therapy, MDMA was 
administered orally at 75 -150mg as an adjunct to psychotherapy  (Greer and Strassman, 
1985) .

MDMA started to be used recreationally in the 1970’s and grew more popular in the 
1980’s.  At that stage, the drug was popularly known as ‘Adam’ (Capela et al., 2009) . Due 
to its abuse potential and negative effects, in 1977 MDMA was declared illegal and since 
then has been  controlled as a Class A drug by the Misuse of D rugs Act (1971)  in the UK.  
In 1985, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) also classified 
MDMA as a Schedule 1 drug due to findings on its neurotoxic potential (Ricaurte et al., 
1985; Schmidt et al., 1987; Peroutka  et al., 1988; Parrott, 2001) . Meanwhile in Australia, 
Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  3	  MDMA was listed in Schedule 9 in 1986 (National Drugs and Poisons Schedule 
Committee) (2009a) . Neverth eless, since then, it has become popular among young adults  
and is  used especially in raves and dance clubs (Green et al., 2003) . In recent years, 
MDMA has also been known by other street names su ch XTC, beans and ‘ecstasy’.  
 
3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine ( MDA ), a major MDMA metabolite,  was first 
synthesized in 1910 by two German chemist s. The pharmacological properties of MDA 
was assessed in 1939 in mice as part of amines related study  looking at the possibility of 
exploit ing the central effects of MDA therapeutically (Gunn et al., 1939) . The first human 
trial of MDA was done in 1941 as a possible therapy for Parkinson disease (Loman e t al., 
1941) . Following World War II, MDA was studied as part of the USA military 
programme. MDA was patented as a cough suppressant in 1958, as an ataractic in 1960, 
and as an appetite suppressant in 1961 (Shulgin and Shulgin, 1990) . Following that, MDA 
was explored more and recommended as an adjunct in psychotherapy (Naranjo et al., 
1967) . Since then, MDA effects such as increased self -awareness and empathy led to a 
widespread abuse of the drug. The DEA classified MDA as a Schedule 1 drug in the 
Controlled Substances Act in 1970 which was earlier than MDMA (Pentne y, 2001) .

1.1.2 Epidemiological studies  
According to the United Nations World Drug Report 2010, it is estimated that between 155 
and 250 million people (3.5 to 5.7% of the population aged 15 -64) used illicit substances at 
least once in 2008, in which amphetamine -like rank as the second most commonly used 
drugs after cannabis, followed by cocaine and opiates (2010) . In 2010, it wa s estimated 
that between 13.7 and 52.9 million people aged 15 to 64 had used  amphetamine -like 
substances, including 10.5 to 25.8 million ecstasy users (0.2% to 0.6% of the population). 
Oceania, East and South -East Asia, North America, and West and Central Europe have the 
highest prevalence  of amphetamine -like substances. According to the United Nations 
World Drug Report  2009 , Australia has the highest prevalence for ecstasy (4.2%) in the 
population aged 15 -64 years  in the world (e.g. Scotland 3.2; New Zealand 2.6; Northern 
Island 1.8; England and Wales 1. 5; Canada 1.3; Republic of Island 1.2; USA 1.1%) 
(2009b) . The percentage of ecstasy users increased from 1.2% in 1993 to 3.5% in 2007, in 
the Australian population aged 14 years  and older (United Nations, 2008b ) with the highest 
prevalence among people aged 20 -29 years. In this group, 11.2% (0.3 million) were recent Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  5	  users of ecstasy , which  was the highest rate compared t o other  groups.  The average 
initiation age of ecstasy users is 22.6 years (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 
2008a)  .  
1.2 Mechanisms of action of MDMA  
1.2.1 Neuropharmacology  
MDMA affects the monoaminergic system by acting on the serotonin (5 -HT), dopamine 
(DA) and noradrenaline (NA) systems. MDMA interacts wi th these systems in various 
ways resulting in  a rapid  increase in extracellular concentrations of neur otransmitter  in the 
synaptic cleft and consequent activation of receptors at postsynaptic neurons. The 
serotonergic system is the main system affected by MDMA in rats, non -human primates, 
and humans (Ricaurte et al., 19 85; Croft et al., 2001; Baumann et al., 2007)  whereas the 
dopaminergic system is the main system affected in mice (Logan et al., 1988; Colado et al., 
2004) . Therefore, m ice may not be a suitable animal model to investigate the effects of 
MDMA and relating them to effects seen in humans  (Logan et al., 1988; Colado et al., 
2004) . 
1.2.1.1  Animal studies  
MDMA enters the neuronal system via monoamine reuptake transporters such as the 
serotonin transporter (5 -HTT) and subsequently binds  to the vesicular monoamine 
transporters (VMAT) and causes increase d extracellular levels  of the neurotransmitters . 
MDMA administration mainly induces acute increase in extracellular levels  of serotonin 
(5-HT) (Gough et al., 1991; Yamamoto et al., 1995; Gudelsky and Nash, 1996; Callaghan 
et al., 2005)  from the vesicles in presynaptic neurons in many brain regions. Previous 
studies have shown the release  of 5 -HT in vitro  in rat brain slices (Johnson et al., 1986; 
Schmidt, 1987b; Schmidt, 1987a) , rat synapto somes (Nichols et al., 1982; Berger et al., 
1992; O'Loinsigh et al., 2001) , and in vivo  microdialysis studies looking at brain Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  6	  extracellular 5 -HT (Gough et al., 1991; Yamamoto et al., 1995; Gudelsky and Nash, 1996; 
Nixdorf et al., 2001; Freezer et al., 2005; Stanley et al., 2007) . MDMA binds to the 5 -HT, 
DA and NA transporters and induces increase in extracellular levels  of the 
neurotransmitters to the synaptic cleft and  prevents the reuptake of the neurotransmitters 
into the presynaptic neurons (Schmidt et al., 1987; Daws et al., 2000; Rothman et al., 2001; 
Callaghan et al., 2005) . 
	  
Figure 1. 2: MDMA pharmacological mechanism of action at the neuronal serotonergic 
terminal and synapse.  
1) M DMA, like 5 -HT, is a substrate for the 5 -HTT and uses the transporter s to enter  the 
neuronal terminal, although at high concentration, it may also enter by diffusio n. 2) Once 
inside, MDMA produces an acute and rapid release  of 5 -HT from storage vesicles, 
possibly by entering the ve sicles via the VMAT and depleting  vesicular neurotransmitter 
stores via a carrier -mediated exchange mechanism. 3) MDMA also inhibit s TPH, the rate -
limiting enzyme for 5 -HT synthesis. 4) MAO -B, located in the outer membrane of the 
mitochondria of serotonergic neurons, is the enzyme responsible for 5 -HT degradation and 
its activity is partially inhibited by MDMA. 5) Due to an increase i n the free cytoplasmic 
pool of 5 -HT, MDMA promotes a rapid release  of intracellular 5 -HT to the neuronal 
synapse via reversal of t he 5 -HTT activity. 6) MDMA hallu cinogenic properties are 
partially a result of agonist activity at the 5 -HT 2A receptor (Capela et al., 2009).  
	  
	  
Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  7	  It has been shown in previous studies that pre -treatment with 5 -HT transporter inhibitors 
such as fluoxetine blocks MDMA -induced 5 -HT release  (Gudelsky and Nash, 1996; 
Rothman e t al., 2001; Mechan et al., 2002 ), which sug gests MDMA -induced 5 -HT release  
involves a  carrier -mediated mechanism. MDMA does not have the same affinity for the 
different types of monoamine transporters . MDMA, administered  intraperitoneally, at 
doses of 10 and 15 mg/kg, resulted  in cerebral extracellular  concentration of 11 and 20 
µM, respectively.  It has the highest potency of inhibiting the 5 -HT transporters (Table 1.2) 
followed by NA transporters and DA transporters whic h indicate the MDMA physiological 
effects are probably mediated mainly through these transporter s.

MDMA also interacts with two key enzymes that are responsible for 5 -HT biosynthesis 
and metabolism. Firstly, MDMA inhibits the activity of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) 
which is responsible for synthesizing tryptophan to 5 -hydroxytryptophan, precursor of 5 -
HT he nce lead s to a decrease  in 5-HT formation (Schmidt and Taylor, 1987; Stone et al., 
1987; Schmidt and Taylor, 1988) . This action causes depletion of 5 -HT stores following 
rapid release  of 5-HT into the synaptic cleft . A study by Stone et al., (1987)  has shown that 
administration of  a single dose of  10mg/kg MDMA produces significant decrease of the Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  8	  TPH enzyme activity in the frontal cortex, neostriatum,  hippocampus and hypothalamus  in 
rats. This action is fo llowed and closely parallels  a decrease in 5 -HT levels in the 
respective brain regions.  
 
Secondly, MDMA inhibits the activity of monoamine oxidase A (MAO -A), which is the 
enzyme responsible for metabolism of 5 -HT to its metabolite, 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid 
(5-HIAA) within the nerve terminal (Colzi et al., 1993; Leonardi and Azmitia, 1994; 
Hewton et al., 2007) . The potency of MDMA at MAO -A is approximately 10 times higher 
(IC 50 = 44µM) than at monoamine oxidase B (MAO -B) in a rat brain preparation (Leonardi 
and Azmitia, 1994) . However, MAO -A is expres sed predominantly in catecholaminergic 
neurons, whereas MAO -B is expressed in serotonergic neurons, astrocytes, and glia 
(Nagatsu, 2004) . These events also lead to an increase in 5 -HT concentration in the 
synaptic cleft and more 5 -HT binding at the postsynaptic receptors. A study by Freezer et 
al., (2005)  has shown that MDMA produces additional increase in striatal 5 -HT, 5 -HT-
related behaviour and hyperthermia when co -administer ed with moclobemide, a MAO -A 
inhibitor.  
 
MDMA also interacts with the dopaminergic system. It increases the extracellular levels  of 
DA from several brain regions such as the striatum, cortex, and nucleus accumbens as 
shown  by in vivo  microdialysis studies (Yamamoto and Spanos, 1988; Gough et al., 1991; 
Nash and Brodkin, 1991; Gudelsky and Nash, 1996)  and in vitr o studies using tissue slices 
(Johnson et al., 19 86; Schmidt, 1987a) . A study by Colado et al., (1999)  showed that 
administration of 15mg/kg MDMA i.p to male Dark Agouti rats produces significant 
increase in extracellular DA concentrations in the striatum.  
 Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  9	  As mentioned previously, MDMA -induced 5 -HT release  results from the interaction of 
MDMA with the reuptake transporters, since this effect is blocked by fluoxetine, a 5 -HT 
transporter inhibitor (Gudelsky and Nash, 1996) . However, the case may be different with 
DA release, as the involvement of DA uptake transporter in MDMA -induced DA release  is 
unclear . It has been shown via in vivo microdialysis that  a DA reuptake inhibitor (GBR 
12909) blocks the increased DA extracellular levels  in the brain (Nash and Brodkin, 1991) , 
and in vitro  studies using brain slice preparation (Koch  and Galloway, 1997 ).  
 
Several studies have demonstrated that MDMA -induced DA release  is asso ciated with the 
stimulation of 5 -HT 2 receptors (Gudelsky et al., 1994) . This receptor is mainly involved in 
mediating the hallucinogenic effects of MDMA (Nichols, 2004) . In this study, it was 
reported that MDMA -induced DA release  in the striatum w as significantly increase d by 
pretreatment with either 5 -HT 2 receptor agonist 2,5 -dimethoxy -4-iodoamphetamine (DOI), 
or the non -selective 5 -HT agonist, 5 -methoxy -N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5 -MeODMT). 
Further support for pretreatment can be found in the fact t hat central administration of the 
5-HT 2A/2C receptor antagonists, ritanserin, completely blocks and attenuates MDMA -
induced DA release  in the substantia nigra and striatum, respectively (Schmidt et al., 1991; 
Yam amoto et al., 1995 ) which suggests the involvement of the 5-HT receptors  in DA 
release  by MDMA.  
 
MDMA has also been shown to affect the noradrenergic system which is important in 
cardiovascular and psychiatry effects in humans (Fitzgerald and Reid, 1990; McCann et 
al., 1996)  as well as thermoregulation in animals (Bexis and Docherty, 2005) . Following 
administration of α 2-adrenoreceptor antagonist BRL 44408, MDMA -induced hyperthermia 
in wild type mice became a biphasic re sponse with an initial hypothermia followed by 
hyperthermia (Bexis and Docherty, 2005) . MDMA causes an increase  in NA extracellular Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  10	  levels  in vitro  from brain tissue and synaptosomal preparation (Fitzgerald and Reid, 1990; 
Rothma n et al., 2001 ). Research has  demonstrated that MDMA has agonist actions at both  
α1- and α 2-adrenoreceptors in rats  in vivo  and in vitro (McDaid and Docherty, 2001) .  
1.2.2 Brain regions  
Several laboratories have studied specific  brain regions following systemic and central 
administration of MDMA, namely the striatum, nucleus accumbens (NA), hippocampus, 
and the preoptic area/anterior hypothalamus (PO/AH) (Esteban et al., 2001; Nixdorf et al., 
2001; Ishiwata et al., 2002; Freezer et al., 2005; O'Shea et al., 2005; Stanley et al., 2007; 
Baumann et al., 2008 ). MDMA action on selected brain regions is consistent with the 
location of receptors that MDMA has high affinity for in th e respective regions, and this is 
related to the pharmacodynamic effects of MDMA  in in vivo  (Callaghan et  al., 2005 ) and 
in vitro  studies (Battaglia et al., 1988a) . An increased expressio n of Fos, a  marker for 
neuronal activation has been shown  in the areas of the brain with high levels of DA and 5 -
HT neurons such as ventral tegmental area and median and dorsal rap he. This expression 
was also shown in  the medial prefrontal cortex, caudate -putamen, nucleus accumbens, 
striatum, and paraventricular hypothalamus which are important in thermoregulation, 
locomotion, and psychological or emotional responses (Stephenson et al., 1999; 
Hargreaves et al., 2007; Col ussi-Mas and Schenk, 2008 ). It has also been shown that  an 
increase in DA extracellular levels  in the st riatum and nucleus accumbens is  important in 
causing effects on locomotor activity and reinforcing effects (Melega et al., 1995; Jones et 
al., 1996; Jones et al., 1999) . Increase of 5 -HT and DA extracellular levels  in the nucleus 
accumbens following MDMA consumption is also important in mediating euphoria, as 
shown by other stimulants, opiates and a lcohol (White et al., 1996) . Microdialysis studies 
have mainly  focused on the  striatum as this brain region is important for locomo tion and 
cognition function, has a large size and  i s  easily accessible by dialysis pr obe (Li et al., 
2006 ).  Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  11	  It has been demonstrated  that MDMA -induced hyperthermia is m ediated by interaction of 
MDMA o n the PO/AH (Benamar et al., 2008) . The PO/AH is important in the regulation 
of body t emperature by autonomic and behavioural responses . It has many warm -sensitive 
neurons sending excitatory and inhibitory signals for heat loss and heat production 
mechanisms, respectively (Boulant and Dean, 1986; Hasegawa et al., 2005) . A 
microdialysis study by Benamar et al., (2008)  administered 20mg/kg MDMA (i.p.) to male 
Sprague -Dawley rats and measured DA extracell ular levels  in the PO/AH and found that 
pretreatment of D 1 DA receptor antagonist SCH 23390 significantly reduced both the 
hyperthermia and increase DA extracellular levels . Several other studies have also 
demonstrated the role of PO/AH in thermoreg ulation (Ishiwata et al., 2002; Ishiwata et al., 
2005) . It has been shown that perfusion of tetrodotoxin (TTX), a sodium -channel blocker 
used to block neurotransmission, int o the PO/AH using microdialysi s produced increase in 
body temperature under normal and high ambient temperature (23°C and 35°C) in freely 
moving rats (Ishiwata et al., 2002) . These findings indicate the role of the PO/AH in 
thermoregulation and further s tudies are needed to understand the mechanism of action of 
MDMA in the PO/AH in detail.

1.3.1 Psychological effects  
MDMA is taken due to its desirable effects such as the feeling of euphoria, increase in self -
esteem and a feeling of closeness to others (Parrott, 2001; Green et al., 2003) . A study by 
Davison and Parrott (1997)  of 20 recreational drug users aged 18 to 31 years, who  have 
used MDMA at least once, found that the subjects reported feelings of happiness, 
calmness, relaxation, increased energy and heightened perception of sound, col our, and 
touch while “on MDMA”, which were reported in  other studies  as well  (Peroutka et al., 
1988; Sumnall et al., 2006) . Due to these  desirable effects and lack of prominent acute side 
effects, MDMA is known as a ‘safe drug ’ in comparison to so -called ‘hard’ drugs like 
cocaine and heroin, (Solowij et al., 1992)  and because it is taken as tablets and does not 
involve unpleasant intravenous administration. It has been reported that recreational poly -
drug users experienced higher feelings of elation,  agreeability and emotional composure 
when under the influence of MDMA in comparison to amphetamine or LSD (Parrott and 
Stuart, 1997) . However, there have been emerging findings on the hepatotoxicity (Jones 
and Simpson, 1999) , neurotoxicity, psychopathology and abuse potential of designer 
drugs, which includes MDMA (Hegadoren et al., 1999) . 
 
Repeated ecstasy consumption can lead to a decrease in ecstasy  effects. MDMA users 
experienced feelings of lethargy, moodiness, irritability, sleep disturbances, depression, 
headaches and paranoia several days after consumption of MDMA (Peroutka et al., 1988; 
Davison and Parrott, 1997; Parrott and Lasky, 1998; Green et al., 2003) .  It has also been 
reported that recreational ecstasy users experienced ‘low mood’ few days after acute 
MDMA consumption (Curran and Travill, 1997; Parrott and Lasky, 1998) . Since MDMA 
causes acute 5 -HT release  and inhibits the activity of TPH (to synthesize 5 -HT), this 
causes depletion of the 5 -HT stores, which may underlie the moodiness, sleep disturbances Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  13	  and d epression effects. Previous studies have investigated the effects of several 5 -HT and 
DA antagonists and uptake inhibitors (ketanserin, haloperidol, and citalopram) on 
psychological effects of MDMA (Liechti et al., 2000 a; Liechti and Vollenweider, 2000a ). 
Pretreatment with citalopram blocked most of the psychological effects of MDMA which 
indicates the involvement of 5 -HT uptake sites in this action (Liechti et al., 2000a) . It w as 
also suggested that MDMA reinforcing properties are associated with increase of DA, as 5 -
HT 2 receptor antagonist, ketanserin, produces significant decrease in MDMA -induced 
perceptual changes and emotional excitation but only slightly affects positive mo od 
responses (Liechti et al., 2000b) . Dopamine is generally thought to be involved in the 
euphoria and arousing effects  of stimulants. Hence, the stimulant -like effects of MDMA 
may be caused partially by 5-HT 2-mediat ed increase of dopamine activity (Liechti et al., 
2000b) . These results suggested the role of both DA and 5 -HT in mediating MDMA -
induced psychological effects (Liechti and Vollenweider, 2001) . 
1.3.2 Physiological effects  
There are also physiological effects ass ociated with MDMA use by humans  which vary 
from minor symptoms to those that are rare but potentially life -threatening. MDMA 
symptoms include muscle aches and tension, jaw clenching and bruxism, elevated blood 
pressure and heart rate, sweating, tremor, insomnia, nausea, chills,  and hyperthermia 
(McCann et al., 1996; Green et al., 2003; Lyles and Cadet, 2003) . Although the incidence  
of the adverse effects are low, these effects are unpredictable and can lead to morbidity and 
death (Gowing et al., 2002) . The effects of citalopram, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor on 
MDMA -induced physiological responses  are marked  (Liechti and Vollenweider, 2000b) . 
Oral administratio n of 1.5mg/kg MDMA produces a significant increase in both systolic 
and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate and these effects were blocked by citalopram 
pretreatment, which indicates that the physiological effects of MDMA are mediated via the Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  14	  5-HT upta ke sites that increase 5 -HT extracellular levels  through the transporter (Liechti 
and Vollenweider, 2000b) . 
 
Hyperthermia is one of the major symptoms follow ing acute MDMA administration and 
this lead s to other adverse effects and multi -organ failure including rhabdomyolysis, acute 
renal failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and dis seminated intravascular coagulation (Green et al., 
2003; Lyles and Cadet, 2003; Hall and Henry, 2006) . MDMA -induced hyperthermia is 
affected by the increase in ambient temperature  (Malberg and Seiden, 1998) . As ecstasy is 
usually consumed in raves and clubs, in an over -crowding environment, high ambient 
temperature settings, and increase physical activity, these conditions potentiate the degree 
of hyperthermia experienced by ecstasy users (Green et al., 2003) . Due to a reaction 
against feeling too hot and excessive sweating, ecstasy users  may  drink large amounts of 
fluids. This causes dilution of sodium and potassium electrolyte levels in the blood, which 
potentially leads to hyponatraemia with cerebral oedema, a related medical condition 
following hyperthermia (Green et al., 2003) . There have also been sudden death cases 
associated with MDMA users due to  excessive sympathomimetic effects of the drug which 
mainly affect individuals with undiagnosed cardiomyopathy, hypertension or congenital 
heart disease (Hall and Henry, 2006) . 
 
MDMA users also experience  symptoms  similar to ‘serotonin syndrome’. S erotonin 
syndrome occurs due to excessive extracellular levels  of 5 -HT to the synapse which 
stimulates the serotonergic system (Gillman, 1999) . This syndrome occurs rapidly and 
ecstasy users experience some of these effects that include hyperthermia, tachycardia, 
shivering, hyperreflexia, tremor, hyperactivity, diarrhoea, mental  confusion and others 
(Gillman, 1999; Parrott, 2002) . Users who experiences these effects were usually required 
to rest in a cool ambient temp erature setting but users who a re severely affected require Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  15	  hospitalisatio n and in some cases, treatment with 5 -HT antagonists such as cyproheptadine 
or chlorpromazine , intubation and rapid cooling (Gillman, 1999) . 
1.3.3 Long -term effects  
Neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies have demonstrated  attenuation of 
serotonergic function and reduction of serotonin transporter density in the brain following 
repeated exposure to MDMA (McCann et al., 1998; Reneman et al., 2002a; Reneman et 
al., 2002b; McCann et al., 20 05). Severa l studies have used positron em ission tomography 
(PET) with the 5 -HT transporter ligand [11C]McN -5652 to examine 5 -HT transporter 
binding in recreational users of MDMA (McCann et al., 1998; Ricaurte et al. , 2000)  and it 
was demonstrated that MDMA users have lower density of brain 5 -HT transporter sites. A 
study by Reneman et al., (2000)  which used single photon e mission computed tomography 
(SPECT) with the 5 -HT 2A receptor ligand [123I]R91150 found significantly lower 5 -HT 2A 
receptor binding ratios in current MDMA users compared to abstinent users, which 
suggests down regulation of 5 -HT 2A receptors.  
 
It was also postulated that long -term MDMA use may be associated with several 
psychological effects such as visual hallucinatio ns and paranoid delusions, together with 
anxiety, depression and panic attacks, and development of memory and cognitive 
impairment (McCann and Ricaurte, 1991a; Schifano, 1991; McCann and Ricaurte, 1992; 
McCann et al., 1 994; Bolla et al., 1998; Parrott and Lasky, 1998; McCann et al., 1999; 
Parrott et al., 2000) , and the problems continue in the drug -free condition (Bolla et al., 
1998) . 
 
There are findings  that linked recreational MDMA users and the develo pment of cognitive 
and memory impairment (Parrott and Lasky, 1998; Chummun et al., 2010; Hanson and 
Luciana, 2010) . Bolla et al., (1998)  have  shown that MDMA users who had used MDMA Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  16	  on at least 25 occ asions (and had abstained from use for more than 2 weeks), exhibited  
impairment of verbal memory and delayed visual memory than MDMA -naïve subjects. A 
study by Parrott et al., (2002)  has also demonstrated severity of MDMA effects directly 
correlate with the extent of MDMA use. This study was done as a web questionnaire in  
novice ecstasy users (1 -9 occa sions), moderate users (10 -99 occa sions), and heavy users 
(more than 100 occasions). It was shown that heavier MDMA users reported more mood 
fluctuation, anxiety and cognitive problems, and poorer performance in memory task (73% 
of heavy users, compared to 19 % of novice users and 52% of heavy users).  
 
As ecstasy is commonly consumed along with alcohol and other drugs , several studies 
have also explor ed at the association of cognitive problems with ecstasy use, especially in 
heavy users in poly -drug use subject s (Morgan, 1999; Quednow et al., 2006) . It was shown 
that MDMA users have significantly worse immediate and delayed recall compared to 
other poly -drug users (alcohol, cigarettes, cannabis, amphetamine, LSD, and cocaine) and 
control subjects (Morgan, 1999) . This  suggests that past exposure to ecstasy in recreational 
ecstasy users affected their memory performance, in compa rison to other pol y-drug use or 
no drug use ( control subjects ).  
 
Heavy MDMA users demonstrate  marked memory deficits in comparison to cannabis users 
and drug -naive control subjects in their memory performance (Quednow et al., 2006) , and 
higher impulsivity and lower decision -making performance in comparison to cannabis and 
non-drug users (Quednow et al., 2007) . This  suggests that heavy use of MDMA causes 
these cognitive problems which is possibly  mediated by impairment of the 5 -HT system. 
However, precaution is needed in drawing conclusion s regarding MDMA effects on 
cognitive impairment in poly -drug users (Croft et al., 2001) . Some MDMA users consume  
cannabis to l ighten the negative experience of MDMA when MDMA -induced euphoria Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  17	  diminishes . However, cannabis has been shown to interact with the dopaminergic system 
(Malone and Taylor, 1999; Nava et al., 2000)  and DA has been sho wn to affect 5 -HT 
related impairment in humans (Liechti and Vollenweider, 2001)  and animal models (Stone 
et al., 1988) .  This indic ates that cannabis is a  confounding  factor in MDMA -induced 
cognitive impairment and certain MDMA users may have experienced the cognitive 
problems caused by cannabis use. Apart from cannabis, ecstasy is normally consumed with 
alcohol (Cassel et al., 2005; Izco et al., 2007 ). Previous studies have reported that MDMA 
and alcohol consumption prolonged the duration of euphoria and well being, in comparison 
to MDMA or alcohol alone (Hernandez -Lopez et al., 20 02). MDMA also reverses alcohol 
sedative effect but did not remove the alcohol -induced psychomotor performance. These 
results are important in terms of poly -drug users, as they might think that they are feeling 
better but actually having impairment of p sychomotor abilities, which may impact road 
safety (Hernandez -Lopez et al., 2002) . A study by Dumont et al. (2008)  investigating the 
effects of co -administration of 100mg MDMA (orally) and alcohol also found that co -
administration of MDMA and alcohol produced significant memory impairment in healthy 
volunteers.  
1.4 Effects of MDMA in animals  
1.4.1 Disruption of thermoregulatio n 
In animal studies, systemic doses of 10 and 15mg/kg of MDMA are used as these doses 
produced reliable changes in body temperature, locomotor activity and biochemical effects 
such as increase in  extracellular levels of  5-HT and DA without causing fatalities (Daws et 
al., 2000; Jaehne et al., 2005; Stanley et al., 2007) . These doses in animals  are comparable 
to those in  humans (Green et al., 2003) .  
 
Hyperthermia is the major acute effect of MDMA. Under normal ambient temperature (20 -
22°C), MDMA administration to rats has been reported to produce both hyperthermia Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  18	  (Colado et al., 1993)  and hypothermia (Malberg and Seiden, 1998)  responses. Previous 
finding s have demonstrated hyperthermia response (1 -2°C) with a peak at about 40 to 60 
min following systemic MDMA administration in rats (Che et al., 1995; Malberg et al., 
1996; Mechan et al., 2002) . Similar to human s, it has also been shown in animal studies 
that ambient temperature affects MDMA -induced hyperthermia (Malberg and Seiden, 
1998) . This study found hypothermic r esponse following administration of 20 and 
40mg/kg MDMA at ambient temperature of 20 -22°C, and hyperthermic response at 
ambient temperature of 28 -30°C in male Holtzman rats. It has also been suggested that 
increase in core temperature of MDMA -treated anima ls increase neurotoxicity. A study by 
Dafters (1994)  has demonstrated dose -dependent hypothermic response in rats housed 
under ambient temperature of 11°C, while a dose -dependent hyperthermic respo nse was 
observed when rats were housed under ambient temperature of 24°C.  
 
Thermoregulation is important in mammals to maintain normal body temperature. Body 
temperature is physiologically  maintain ed by a balance between heat production and 
dissipation (Rusyniak and Sprague, 2005)  via regulation of the sympathetic nervous 
system (Lowell and Spiegelman, 2000) . Nevertheless, the mechanism of action that 
underlies MDMA -induced hyperthermia response remains unclear as the heat production 
mechanism and impairment in thermoregulation following MDMA administration is not 
clear ly defined (Capela et al., 2009) . There have been  suggestions regarding the  major role 
of 5-HT (Rothwell, 1994) , DA (Cox and Lee, 1980)  and NA (Mallick et al., 2002)  in the 
regulation of hypothalamic control of the core bo dy temperature. Stimulant drugs  which 
are known to affect the dynamics of these neurotransmitters  level  in the brain  could 
potentially disrupt normal thermoregulation. Although MDMA -induced hyperthermia 
involves 5 -HT release  (Freezer et al., 2005; Stanley et al., 2007) , methamphetamine -
induced hyperthermia has been shown to involve DA release  (Bronstein and Hong, 1995) , Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  19	  suggesting a role for  DA as well in hyperthermic response s. Other studies have also 
reported the role of DA in MDMA -induced hyperthermia. The  D1 receptor antagonist SCH 
23390 (0.3 -2 mg/kg) has been shown to attenuate MDMA -induced hyperthermia (Mechan 
et al., 2002) , whereas administr ation of selective 5 -HT 2A/2C antagonists, methysergide, and 
ritanserin, failed to inhibit MDMA -induced hyperthermia (Mechan et al., 2002) . Previous 
microdialysis studies have also shown that increase extracellular 5 -HT release  has no 
association with MDMA -induced hyperthermia (Freezer et al., 2005; Stanley et al., 2007) , 
and administration of the selective 5 -HT u ptake inhibitor fluoxetine blocked the increase in 
extracellular 5 -HT but had no effect on hyperthermia (Schmidt et al., 1990; Berger et al., 
1992; Malberg et al., 1996) . These results suggest the involve ment of both  5-HT and DA  
in MDMA -induced hyperthermia.  
1.4.2 Behavioural effects  
Apart from hyperthermia, MDMA also produces acute ‘serotonin syndrome’ in animals 
and this effect is potentially caused by significant increase in  extracellular 5-HT levels  in 
several brain reg ions. The 5 -HT syndrome include  enhanced locomotor activity, head -
weaving, forepaw treading, piloerection, penile erection, proptosis, ejaculation, salivation, 
and defecation (Spanos and Yamamoto, 1989) . It was shown that administration of an 
MAO inhibitor, L -tryptophan (Grahame -Smith, 1971b) , non -selective 5 -HT agonists 
(Grahame -Smith, 1971a) , and 5 -HT1A agonist 8 -OH-DPAT (Goodwin and Green, 1985)  
could produced this serotonin syndrome, suggesting the importance increased  in 5-HT 
activity.  
 
MDMA also produces acute, dose -dependent hyperlocom otor response accompanied by  
major behavioural features of the serotonin syndrome (Spanos and Yamamoto, 1989; 
Colado et al., 1993) . The enhanced locomotor effects f ollowing MDMA administration 
could  be due to increased  monoamine extracellular levels  and subsequent activation of Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  20	  monoamine receptors in the brain. Kehne et al., (1996)  showed dose -dependent increased 
in locomotion following administration of 1, 2, 4, 10, and 20 mg/kg MDMA, which was 
blocked by pretreatment of 1mg/kg 5 -HT 2A receptor antagonist MDL 100907. It was also 
shown that MDMA -induced locomotor activity wa s blocked following pretreatment with 
fluoxetine (Callaway et al., 1990) , suggesting the involvement of 5 -HT release  and 5 -HT 2A 
receptor in MDMA -induced locomotor activity.  
1.4.3 Cardiovascular effects  
Cardiovascular response to ambient temperature is closely related to core temperature and 
mechanism for heat production in rats (Chambers et al., 2000) . Increased heart rate  may 
provide indication of heat production and impairment of thermoregulation (Gordon, 1990; 
Gordon et al., 1991; Jaehne et al., 2011) . It was reported that MDMA users have increased 
plasma catecholamine levels, which may be due to noradrenergic hyperactivity and  this 
could linked to cardiovascular effects (Stuerenburg et al., 2002) . It has been demonstrated  
that MDMA administration in r ats increase  heart rate, as well as locomotor activity and 
body temperature (Green et al., 2003; Bexis and Docherty, 2006; Jaehn e et al., 2008 ). 
MDMA affects cardiovascular function in rats as it has cardiac stimulant effects which can 
lead to tachycardia and arrhythmia (Gordon et al., 1991 ). This might be due to the action of 
MDMA displacing NA from adrenergic nerve terminals (Fitzgerald and Reid, 1993)  and 
effects on adrenoreceptors. As mentioned before, MDMA has agonist effects on α 1- and 
α2-adrenoreceptors both in vivo  and in vitro (McDaid and Docherty, 2001) . These receptors 
are involved in jaw clenching effect  reported by MDMA users, panic attacks (McCann et 
al., 1996) , blood pressure effects in rat (McDaid and Docherty, 2001)  and hyperthermia in 
mice (Bexis and Docherty, 2005) . A study by O’Cain et al., (2000)  has also shown that 
MDMA (0.01 -3 mg/kg i.v.) produced significant bradycardia and a dose -dependent 
increase in mean arterial pressure, in which the arterial pressure recorded we re comparable 
to that showed in human study foll owing MDMA consumption (Vollenweider et al., 1998) .  Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  21	  1.4.4 Long -term effects  
There have been many findings that link MDMA consumption and long -term depletion of 
5-HT and 5 -HIAA (Schmidt et al., 1987; Battaglia et al., 1988b; McKenna and Perout ka, 
1990; Colado et al., 1993 ). It has been shown in animal studies that administration of 
MDMA causes damage to axons and serotonin axon terminals. Chronic administration of 
MDMA to rats leads to problems in serotonergic components in the brain such as  a  
decrease in tryptophan hydroxylase (Stone et al., 1988) , 5-HT and its metabolite 5 -HIAA 
in neostriata, cerebral cortex, and hippocampus (Schmidt et al., 1986 ), loss of 5 -HT uptake 
sites (Battaglia et al., 1988b) , 5-HT terminal degeneration (O'Hearn et al., 1988) , reduction 
of 5-HT transporter (5 -HTT) binding in cortex (Green et al., 2003) , and impairment of 
central 5 -HT function (Hatzidimitriou et al., 1999) . Several anatomical observations have 
also supported these findings using techniques such as immunohistochemistry (O'Hearn et 
al., 1988) , silver impregnation methods (Commins et al., 1987) , and Fluoro -Jade B staining 
for neuronal degeneration (Schmued, 2003; Fornai et al., 2004) . A study by Hatzidimitriou 
et al., (1999)  using neuroimaging technique has shown that MDMA -treated monkeys still 
have diminished 5 -HT immunoreactivity  seven years after treatment, which indicates the 
long-term effect of MDMA in causing neurotoxici ty. 
 
A study by  Callaghan et al.,  (2006)  has shown that repeated MDMA administration 
produces reductions in cortical 5 -HT transporter binding and 5 -HT content  in rats . 
Treatment with MDMA once daily for 4 days (10 or 20 mg/kg MDMA) resulted in 
significant decrease  (20 mg/kg; 23% of vehicle treatment) in SERT density one week after 
final drug administration. Meanwhile, rats treated twice daily  for 4 days (10 or 20 mg/kg 
MDMA) showed significant re ductions in cortical 5 -HT content (20 mg/kg; 39% of 
vehicle treatment).  In another study,  O’Shea et al., (1998)  investigated  M D M A -induced 
neurotoxicity in Dark Agouti rats following administration of single doses of MDMA (4, Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  22	  10, and 15 mg/kg i.p.), repeated low doses (4 mg/kg)  once or twice daily for four 
consecutive days, and repeated low doses (4 mg/kg) twice weekly for eight consecutive 
weeks. Serotonergic depletion was observed in the hippocampus, cortex, and striatum one 
week post -treatment following single doses of MDMA ( 10 and 15 mg/kg). Repeated low 
doses of MDMA (4  mg/kg) daily for four days had  no significant effect on 5 -HT and 5 -
HIAA brain concentrations, whereas 4mg/kg twice daily caused depletion of 5 -HT in all 
brain regions. Interestingly, repe ated MDMA doses weekl y also had  no significant effect 
on 5-HT and 5 -HIAA ceoncentrations . These results suggest that high and frequent doses 
of MDMA are required to cause neurotoxic effects, which may be critical to recreational 
MDMA users. However, this is not the case in fem ale DA rats, an animal model of the 
CYP2D6 poor metabolizer. It was demonstrated  that female DA rats produced lower 
concentrations of neurotoxic metabolites of MDMA, thus were less susceptible to long -
term neurotoxic loss of 5 -HT in the brain (Colado et al., 1995) . 
 
There has been suggestion that hyperthermia in fluence s the severity of  M D M A -induced 
serotonergic neurotoxicity  and this has been  linked to dopamine receptor activity (Malberg 
et al., 1996; Malberg and Seiden, 1998; Yuan et al., 2001; Yuan et al., 2002) . It has been 
shown than inducing hypothermia protects agains  neurotoxicity and increasing body 
temperature causes neurotoxicity (Malberg et al., 1996) . However, pretreatment with 
compounds such as fluoxetine and mazindol protected  against MDMA -induced 
neurotoxicity but did not block the MDMA -induced increase in body temperature 
(Shankaran et al., 1999; Falk et al., 2002) , suggesting a mechanism unrelated to  the 
occurrence of hyperthermia. It is important to consider the effects of hyperthermia in 
interpreting the results on MDMA -induced neurotoxicity.  Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  23	  1.5 Pharmacokinetics of MDMA  
1.5.1 Humans  
MDMA is usually taken orally and sold in the form of tablets in various desi gns, logos and 
colours and may also be available in capsule form. Other routes of administration include 
intranasal and intravenous. MDMA is usually produced in racemic mixture, in which the 
S(+) isomer of MDMA (effective dose is 80 -120mg) is more potent i n causing euphoria 
and other desired effects than its R( -) isomer (effective dose is about 300mg), which 
predominantly has mescaline -like effects (Fantegrossi and Godlewski, 2003; de la Torre et 
al., 2004; Parrott, 2004 ; Schifano, 2004 ). However, the doses, purity or the content of 
‘ecstasy’ tablets containing MDMA may vary between batches, within and also between 
countries (Capela et al., 2009) . 
 
According to Green et al. (2003) , one tablet of ecstasy contains on average 80 to 150 mg of 
MDMA. Although common amount of tablets consumed are 1 to 2  tablets, the number 
may vary until 10 tablets in some users (Parrott, 2001) . However, a study by Morefield et 
al. (2011)  looking at the pattern of ecstasy used has shown that the dose of MDMA per pill 
can range from 0 to 245mg  and users consumed from one half to five tablets. The term 
‘ecstasy’ usually refers to MDMA but the tablets may contain other substances such as 
other amphetamine derivatives (methamphetamine (METH), para -methamphetamine 
(PMA), 3,4 -methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), methylenedioxyethylamphetamine 
(MDE), 2,5 -dimethoxy -4-bromoamphetamine (DOB), 4 -methylthioamphetamine (4 -
MTA)), and other substances such as ketamine, caffeine, ephedrine or even not at all 
(placebo) (Cole et al., 2002; Parrott, 2004; Morefield et al., 2011) . 
 
Following oral consumption, MDMA is ab sorbed from the gastrointestinal tract by the 
bloodstream. It takes about 20 to 60 min for the onset of MDMA effects to occur. The peak Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  24	  occurring 60 to 90 minutes after consumption, and the acute effects last for 3 to 5 hours 
(Green et al., 2003) . Following oral ingestion of MDMA by humans (50 -125mg), 
maximum concentration (C max) appears at 2 hours with half -life of 8 hours (de la Torre et 
al., 2004) . After a single dose of MDMA, it takes about 40 hours to eliminate 95% of 
MDMA from humans. The elimination ha lf-life of 100 mg MD MA is about 8 -9 hours, 
which is  lower than methamphetamine (10 -12 hours) and amphetamine (12 -15 hours) at 
similar doses with MDMA (de la Torre et al., 2004) . According to de la Torre et al. (2000) , 
MDMA has a non -linear pharmacokinetics, in which the increase in plasma and brain 
concentration of MDMA is not proportional to administration of increasing doses of 
MDMA. This can be explained by a saturation of MDMA metabolism and interaction of 
MDMA metabolites with the enzymes involved in its own metabolism pathways. Hence, 
changes in metabolism can occur if MDMA is taken repeatedly (de la Torre et al., 2000; d e 
la Torre et al., 2004 ). 
1.5.2 Animals  
In order to improve our interpretation of animal based studies on MDMA, extensive 
pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics studies have been undertaken in animals. These 
include d mice, rats, and primates. A study by Baumann et al., (2009)  looked at the effects 
of 2mg/kg and  10mg/kg of MDMA and route of administration on pharmacokinetics of 
MDMA. The study found that at low -dose, oral administration of MDMA produces low 
levels of MDMA, whereas at high dose, intraperitoneal administration produces high levels 
of MDMA. The half -life of MDMA was 45 min in rats given 2mg/kg which is shorter than 
half-life of MDMA in humans which is about 7 to 9 hours (de la Torre et al., 2000) . The 
half-life of MDMA in rats given 10mg/kg MDMA was longer than 1 hour which suggests 
that longer time for drug elimination at high -dose. The study also found that a low -dose of 
MDMA (2mg/kg) pro duces Cmax values (~200ng/ml) comparable to humans given 
recreational doses of the drug (1.3 to 1.7mg/kg) under controlled conditions (de la Torre et Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  25	  al., 2000) . They also found evidence of non -linear pharmacokinetics of MDMA 
metabolism in rats which have previously been shown in monkeys and humans (Chu et al., 
1996; de la Torre et al., 2000; Mueller et al., 2008) . 
1.5.3 MDMA m etabolites  
There are differences between MDMA metabolism in humans and rats. In humans, 
MDMA O-demethylenation to HHMA is the major metabolic pathway whereas in rats N-
demethylena tion to MDA is dominant. This causes differences in the degree of acute 
effects of MDMA as MDA is an active metabolite (de la Torre and Farre, 2004) . However, 
a study by Baumann et al. (2009)  found a lower concentration of MDA in comparison to 
MDMA and HHMA, suggesting N -demethylation is not the major pathway of MDMA 
metabolism  in rats.  However, this does not neglect the fact that MDA is an important 
active metabolite of MDMA in rats and humans (Maurer et al., 2000; de la Torre et al., 
2004) . Although N -demethylation to MDA is a minor pat hway in humans (~10%), α -
MeDA is a metabolite for both MDMA and MDA (Erives et al., 2008) , which can undergo 
this metabolic pathways and producing potential neurotoxic com pounds.  
 
Metabolism pathways are another factor that causes difficulty in scaling MDMA data 
across species. MDMA metabolism in humans and animals occur in the liver (de la Torre 
et al., 2000; de la Torre and Farre, 200 4; Baumann et al., 2009 ). MDMA has a complex 
metabolism profile as it involves several biotransformation pathways.  Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  26	  	  
Figure 1. 3: Pathways of MDMA metabolism. Adapted from Capela et al (2009).  
There are two major pathways of  MDMA metabolism  (Figure 1.3) . It is O-demethylenated 
to 3,4 -dihydroxymethamphetamine (HHMA/N -Me-α-MeDA), a product with neurotoxic 
potential (Segura et al., 2001)  and N-demethylenated to 3,4 -methylenedioxyamphetamine 
(MDA) (Goni -Allo et al., 2008a ). MDA is further metabolized to 3,4 -
dihydroxyamphetamine (HHA/α -MeDA) via O-demethylenation. HHMA and HHA then 
undergo O-methylation catalysed by catechol -O-methyltransferase (COMT) to 4 -hydroxy -
3-methoxymeth -amphetamine (HMMA) and 4 -hydroxy -3-methoxyamphetamine (HMA), 
respectively. The half -life for MDA and HMMA following MDMA (10mg/kg i.p) 
administration is ~2.18 h and 2.73 h, respectively (Baumann et al., 2009) . HHMA and 
Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  27	  HHA can rapidly undergo oxidaton to the corresponding ortho -quinones, which are highly 
electrophilic, as they can react with the cysteinyl sulfhydryl group in  glutathion (GSH) to 
form GSH conjugates, which can lead to formation of neurotoxic products (Hiramatsu et 
al., 1990; Green et al., 2003; de la Torre and Farre, 2004; Erives et al., 2008) . Some of 
MDMA metabolites ar e pharmacologically active and claimed to be responsible for the 
hepatotoxic, hyperthermic, and neurotoxic effects (Hiramatsu et al., 1990)  which results in 
difficulty to determine and to assess which metabolites are actually causing the acute  and 
long-term effects of MDMA.  
 
(−)MDA was reported to be more active in humans and has hallucinogenic effect, while 
(−)MDMA was less active than (+)MD MA and had few or no hallucinogenic effects 
(Anderson et al., 1978) . However, r acemic and (+)MDMA produced only amphetamine -
liked effects. In contrast, racemic MDA and (−)MDA produced 4 -methyl -2,5-
dimethoxyphenylisopropylamine (DOM) -liked effects whereas racemic and (+)MDA 
produced amphetamine -liked effects (Anderson et al., 1978) . Since (−)isomers of MDMA 
and MDA have higher affinities for the radiolabelled 5 -HT 2 receptors  (Table 1.4) , 
(+)MDMA in humans results in weak hallucinogenic effects, whereas MDA will results in 
stronger hallucinogenic effects (Teitler et al., 1990 ).

can undergo oxidation and conjugation with glutathione (GSH). It has been shown that 
metabolite of α -MeDA, 5 -(Glutathion -S-yl)-α-methyldopamine [5 -(GSyl) -α-MeDA] 
(720nmol, i.c.v.) was rapidly cleared from all brain regions e xamined (Miller et al., 1995) . 
This finding was in parallel with formation of 5 -(cystein -S-yl)-α-methyldopamine [5 -
(CYS) -α-MeDA, which correlated with regional differences in the distribution of γ -GT. 
They also indicated the ability of the brain to syn thesize mercapturic acids as evidenced by 
formation of 5 -(N-acetyl -ι-cystein -S-yl)-α-MeDA [5 -(NAC) -α-MeDA] in all brain regions 
(hypothalamus > midbrain/diencephalon/telencephalon > pons/medulla > hippocampus > 
cortex > striatum). Moreover, direct injectio n of [5 -(GSyl) -α-MeDA] and [5 -(NAC) -α-
MeDA] (Bai et al., 1999) , and i.c.v. administration of 2,5 -bis-(glutathion -S-yl)-N-Me-α-
MeDA (Miller et al., 1997)  have been shown to produce prolonged depletion in 5 -HT in 
the striatum, cortex and hippocampus and neurobehavioural changes similar to systemic 
MDMA and MDA administration.

	  Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  29	  Despite the findings described above, it may be possible that direct administration of 
MDMA into the hippocampus and striatum did not produce a hyperthermia response as 
these brain regions are not involved in the control of body temperature. Hence, it is 
important to look at the effects of central MDMA and MDA in the preoptic area/anterior 
hypothalamus (PO/AH) which plays a role in central thermoregulation (Ishiwata et al., 
2002; Nagashima, 2006) . Apart from that, as mention previously, distribution of [3H]M DA 
binding to brain membranes is not similar (Zaczek et al., 1989) , which suggests uneven 
effects of MDA on different brain regions.  
 
1.6 Appraisal of methodological approaches used to assess MDMA effects 
in animal models  
Various methods have been used to determine MDMA effects in animal  models and the 
parameters meas ured include thermoregulatory, behavioural, physiological and 
neurochemical  as summarized in Table 1.6 . Although one of the primary aims of these 
studies were to assess MDMA -induced hyperthermi a and subsequent changes in brain 
neurotransmitter concentrations and resulting neuroroxicity, the methods used to measure 
these effects have been shown to produce confounding effects following MDMA 
administration and difficult to relate effects observed i n animal models to humans.  Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  29 	  Table 1. 6: Summary of a number of MDMA studies.  References and dose  Rats strain  Ambient  Parameters measured

following MDMA administration (Gallaher et al., 1985; Colado et al., 1995; Marston et al., 
1999; Freezer et al., 2005; Stanley et al., 2007) . From Table 1.6, at normal ambient 
tempe rature, it was shown that Tc  measured using rectal probe showed an initial decrease 
in Tc followed by subsequent increase in Tc (Freezer et al., 2005) . Whe  Tc was measured 
using telemetry , the rats showed hypothermia response (Bexis and Docherty, 2006)  which 
is consistent with other studies which reported hypothermia following MDMA 
administration at normal ambient  temperature (Marston et al., 1999) . Interestingly, another 
study which administered MDMA at normal ambient temperature showed no significant 
change i n Tc (Nixdorf et al., 2001) . However, this result is consistent with other studies 
which found no significant change in Tc following central administration of MDMA 
(Esteban et al., 2001; Goni -Allo et al., 2008a) .  
 
This rectal measurement requires handling of rats  and repeated insertion of rectal probe 
into the rectum  thus producing stress -induced increase in body temperature (Gordon, 1990)  
and can also affect their heart rate, blood pressure and also locomotor activity.  In Table 
1.6, it can be seen that locomotor activity following MDMA administration varies in 
normal and high ambie nt temperatures, which makes it difficult to interpret. However, in  a 
study by Clement et al.  (1989) , it was demonstrated that when mice were handled and pick 
up for 15 s ec, the body temperature and ac tivity increase.  In the same study, mice were 
also handled repeatedly at 5 min intervals for 30 min which resulted in increase in body 
temperature and activity (Clement et al., 1989) . For neurochemical analysis, rats which  Tc 
was measured using rectal probe showed a higher extracellular levels  of 5 -HT ranging 
from 375 to 600% from baseline (Freezer et al., 2005; Stanley et al., 2007) , in comparison 
to rats which Tc was measured with less invasive technique such as ear thermometer which 
showed an increase of 124% from basel ine (Clemens et al., 2007) .  Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  31	  A method, known as the telemetry, has been developed capable of monitoring core body 
temperature, blood pressure, heart rate and locomotor activity which does not involve 
restraining and repeated insertion of rectal probe  thus eliminating stress -induced increase 
in body temperature (Clement et al., 1989; Dilsaver et al., 1990; Irvine et al., 1997)  and 
eliminating confounding effects on heart rate, blood pressure, and locomotor activity 
(Wright et al., 1989; Guiol et al., 1992; van den Buuse, 1994; Gegout -Pottie et al., 1999) . 
Previous study has also shown that measurement of temperature in rats using rectal probe 
and thermosensor telemetry produces qualitatively similar results  but quantitatively 
different (Dilsaver et al., 1990) . Researchers have used telemetry to measure the effects of 
MDMA on these parameters in animal models (Bexis and Docherty, 2005; Jaehne et al., 
2005; Bexis and Docherty, 2006) . In the present study, we will be using telemetry which is 
used to continuously monitor core body temperature, heart rate and locomotor activity of 
the rats.  
1.6.1 Telemetry  
1.6.1.1  History  
Telemetry was first used in 1959 for ecology study in which the transmitters were d esigned 
for implantation in the woodchucks (Le Munyan et al., 1959) . Since then, more approaches 
have been made to produce miniaturize transmitters that are smaller, more durable and 
have longer transmitting life expectancies (Houseknecht, 197 0). During this period, 
telemetry was used for simple application and its use was limited for measurement of one 
physiological parameter, which is body temperature. The technique has evolved to more 
complex system over the last thirty years capable of m easuring several physiological 
paramaters including cardiovascular  (Murray et al., 1968; Fryer et al., 1975; Rubenson et 
al., 1984) , locomotor activity  (Clement et al., 1989) , heart rate (Gordon et al., 1991; Irvine 
et al., 2006)  variables in large animals . In the 1990s, telemetry has been  developed to 
evaluate continuous spontaneous locomotor activity and body temperature in rodents, in Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  32	  experimental models of inflammation (Gegout -Pottie et al., 1999) , and simultaneous 
measurement of diastolic and systolic blood pressures and heart rate  (Wright et al., 1989; 
Guiol et al., 1992) . 
1.6.1.2  Design methodology of telemetric system  
The telemetric system has been used to collect physiological data such as core body 
temperature, heart rate, and locomotor activity (Table 1.7) in conscious, freely moving 
animals. It consists of an implantable transmitter, receiver cosolidation matrix and 
computer with acquisition software (Guiol et al., 1992; Rodsiri et al., 2011)  as shown in 
Figure 1.4 . The transmitters and receivers are available in variable size and models to 
allow optimum usage for different animal models ranging from mice and rats to dogs and 
primate. The tra nsmitter devices are surgically implanted and can continuously transmit 
data via radio frequency signals to a nearby receiver, which is then collected by the data 
acquisition system.

1.6.2 Microdialysis  
1.6.2.1  History  
Before the development of microdialysis, previous studies which measured transmitter 
extracellular levels  in anaesthetized and freely moving animals used the push -pull 
technique and i.c.v perfusion to collect substances such as acetylcholine and 5 -HT (Myers, 
1970) .  The i.c.v perfusion technique can only be done in relatively large areas of brain 
tissue. The push -pull cannula technique allows collection of endogenous neurochemical 
compounds in the brain (Myers, 1970; Lavenhar an d Palanker, 1976; West et al., 1992 ). 
The cannula is connected to inlet and outlet tubing.  Perfusion is carried out by attaching 
the inner cannula and the reservoir outflow tube with polyethylene tubing to glass syringes, 
driven by reciprocating pump (Yaksh and Yamamura, 1974) . However,  this technique 
cause lesion in the brain due to the large size of the implanted cannula, and direct contact 
between the dialysate and the tissue, the flow rate used during perfusion (Redgrave, 1977; 
Dluzen and Ramirez,  1986; Zhang et al., 1992; Bourne, 2003 ). In 1966, Bito et al. (1966)  
introduced the concept  of collecting samples from small interstitial tissue using a dialysis 
bag. This technique is refined by using dialytrode to perfuse solution through the dialysis 
bag and accessible for collection. Ungerstedt and Pycock (1974)  improved the design by 
increasing the surface area of the dialysis membrane and the efficiency of the probe to 
collect substances, in which contributed significantly to the use of microdialysis technique 
nowadays.  References  Subject  Parameters measured

Microdialysis is a technique used to measure chemical subtances in a tissue of interest 
continuously in freely moving animals. The microdialysis system consists of a probe and 
guide cannula, microinjection pump, inlet and outlet tubing, and collection tube. The probe 
consists of a small semipermeable hollow fibre membrane, connected to an inlet and outlet 
tubing. Following the animal recovery, the dialysis tube is perfused with solution of 
interest by the microinjection  pump at certain flow rates through the inlet tubing. 
Molecules pass the semipermeable membrane will diffuse down their concentration 
gradient into or out of perfusate (de Lange et al., 2000) . This solution (dialysate) will then 
leave the probe through the outlet tubing and collected using a tube. The concentration of 
the drug in the dialystes reflect the concentration of the drug in the extracellular fluid 
around the semipermeable membrane (de Lange et al., 2000 ). The dialysates can be 
analyzed using various analytical technique such as High Performance Liquid 
Chromatography (HPLC) with electrochemical detection and liquid chromatography with 
mass spectrometry (LC -MS).  
 
The no-net-flux microdialysis method  can also be used to determine in vivo  recovery and 
involves the perfusion of different concentrations of the neurotransmitter of interest 
through the dialysis probe under steady -state condition. If a linear relationship and true 
steady -state conditions exist, the slope of the line gives the dialysis recovery of the 
neurotransmitter . However, this method of calibration involves lengthy experimental 
procedure and it is not suitable for the type of e xperiments conducted in our study (de 
Lange et al., 1997) . 
 
The probe and cannula are stereotaxically placed in the br ain of an animal under 
anaesthes ia. They come in various membrane lengths  such as 2mm and 4mm to Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  35	  accommodate different tissue siz e and region such as in the brain, liver, and kidney (Chefer 
et al., 2009) . Every type of dialysis probe produces certain tissue damage when imp lanted 
into the brain (Santiago and Westerink, 1990) . It has been demonstrated that neuronal 
tissue lesion is directly related to the size of the cannulas (Westerink and De Vries, 1988) . 
This study shows that U -shaped cannula causes small ruptures and signs of bleeding in 
comparison t o transtriatal probe which causes no ruptures and occasional signs of bleeding.  
 
The microdialysis technique has several advantages. The advantage of microdialysis in 
comparison to other in vivo perfusionis is due to the probe size (Chefer et al., 2009) . The 
probe is smaller than the devices used in push -pull technique, thus access smaller area of 
tissue. Second, the membrane provides a physical barrier between the perfusate and tissue, 
thus protecting the tissue. This technique also allow lower flow rate in comparison to other 
perfusion technique, thus reducing analyte depletion. Other than that, it allows monitoring 
of endogenous substances, all ows continous and uninterrupted flow overtime without 
constant visual monitoring, less degradation of compounds (oxidative enzymes do not pass 
through the membrane) (Myers et al., 1998) . Microdi alysis also reflects free concentrations 
in tissues and plasma, which allows access to information on drug transport equilibration 
across membranes (de Lange et al., 2000)  and collection of microdialysates at certain time 
interval  to measure neurotransmitter  extracellular levels  and drugs concentration in the 
brain. Microdialysis also allows local perfusion of a drug into a discrete brain region. This 
is important especially in studies which are interested in metabolism of c ertain drugs and 
direct effects of the drugs in a brain region. Since tissue trauma can occur following probe 
implantation  (Drijfhout et al., 1995) , it is important to determine the optimal times aft er the 
implantation for the substances of interest.  It is optimal to collect data 1 and 2 days after 
implantation, which allow recovery from tissue reactions  and before the long -term 
reactions occur (de Lange et al., 2000) . It is also important to be aware of environmental Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  36	  stress, as this has been shown to linked with an increase in DA and other neurotransmitters, 
which can result in incorrect measurement of basal levels of the neurotransmitters. 
However, this limitation ca n be reduced by placing the animals in the habituation cage and 
allowing habituation times before data collection (Bourne, 2003) . Examples of tissues and 
compounds analy sed by microdialysis  are shown in t ables 1.8 and 1.9 .

Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  39	  Previously, there have been separate studies looking at the physiological changes following 
MDMA administration and the extracellular levels  of neurotransmitters in the brain  (Table 
1.10). These studies tried to relate physiological changes following acute MDMA 
administration with long -term 5 -HT an d DA concentrations  in the rat brain. Hence, these 
studies are unable to relate acute physiological changes with simultaneous 5 -HT and DA 
extracellular levels  in the brain. In addition, as microdialysis causes no net fluid loss, 
samples can be collected contin uously from a single freely moving animals for hours or 
days (Li et al., 2006) . Other studies which sacrifices rats at different time points and 
measure the exogenous and endogenous substances in the tissue of interest would measure 
the total concentrations of bound and unbound drugs  hence unable to determine 
extracellular concentrations of the drugs . However, microdialysis allows m easurement of 
the free drug concentrations that bind to the receptors. This will provide pharmacokinetic 
information for drugs which interact with receptors in the extracellular space (de Lange et 
al., 2000) . Since MDMA is a very lipid soluble substance, it is possible for MDMA to 
diffuse from the probe site to other brain areas, and removal from the brain via plasma 
clearance might produce a lower concentration in the brain than that is required to produce 
pharmacodynamic effects.  A study by Esteban et al. (2001)  placed a second probe near the 
first probe (1mm) to recover MDMA from the perfusion of the first probe. Following 
perfusion of 400µM MDMA for 6 h, the estimated actual concentration of MDMA is 
between 10.4 and 19.5µM, which is in the range of concentrations found following 
systemic administration of 10mg/kg MDMA.

1.6.2.3  Ethical implications of experimental design  
Some studies used methods which involved postmortem analysis at several single time 
points after drug administration, in which each animal provides data for only one time 
point. This method is usually performed when analysing drug, blood, plasma, or 
neurot ransmitters concentrations in the brain at certain time points. Since microdialysis is a 
real-time analysis, it allows continuous sampling during the entire course of drugs 
administration for each subject. Apart from continuous sampling, the animals can be  used 
again after the drug washout period. These results in the ability to reduce the number of 
subjects needed in comparison to other methodological approach.  
1.6.3 Combined telemetry and microdialysis  
It has been demonstrated previously that both telemetry and  microdialysis are good 
methodological approach es to assess MDMA effects in animal models, especially the 
effect on core body temperature. However, they provide a better methodological approach 
if they are use simultaneously. Although telemetry and microdi alysis have been used 
previously for decades, the combined telemetry and microdialysis hav e only been used 
over the past 5  years (Benamar et al., 2008; Rodsiri et al., 2011) . Interestingly, both of 
these studies used telemetry only to record Tc. Benamar et al. (2008) used different type of 
telemetry, known as biotelemetric -thermosensor which emits Hertzian waves to a receiver, 
at a rate directly proportional to temperature (Dilsaver et al., 1990)  to measure Tc whereas 
Rodsiri et al. (2011) used telemetry with radio -transmitter to measure Tc and LMA.  Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  41	   Table 1. 11: Studies of MDMA using combined telemetry and microdialysis techniques.  
	  
Benamar et al. (2008) used combined telemtry and microdialysis techniques to evaluate the 
relationship betwe en MDMA -induced hyperthermia  and the extracellular level of DA in 
the PO/AH. Following MDMA administration, it is shown that 20mg/kg MDMA produces 
significant hyperthermia accompanied by increase in extracellular DA in the PO/AH. Both 
of these effects decreased following pretreatment  of D1 receptor antagonist, SCH 23390. 
On the other hand, Rodsiri et al. (2011) used combined telemetry and microdialysis 
techniques to evaluate the effects of MDMA on Tc, LMA and their relationship with 
hippocampal 5 -HT extracellular levels . It was  shown in this study that MDMA 
administration produces significant changes in Tc (both hypothermia and hyperthermia) 
and acute hyperactivity. However, it was demonstrated that changes in LMA and Tc are 
not related to the magnitude of 5 -HT extracellu lar levels  in the hippocampus. From both of 
the studies mention above, it can be seen that combined telemetry and microdialysis 
techniques provide a better approach to measure physiological and behavioural changes 
following MDMA administration and to relat e the changes to neuropharmacological 
changes in the brain, in particular changes in extracelullar monoamine concentrations.

measure heart rate, a parameter also affected  by MDMA. It has been established that 
MDMA disrupts cardiovascular function and toxicity such as cardiac arrhythmias and 
myocarditis (Badon et al., 2002) . Since MDMA affects cardiovascular system, it is also 
importa nt to measure heart rate in addition to Tc and LMA. In addition, it has been shown 
that MDMA effect on Tc is related to its effect on HR. Previously in MDMA studies, mean 
arterial pressure (MAP) was measured to elucidate the effects of MDMA on cardiovascul ar 
effect and HR was derived from MAP reading using a software (O'Cain et al., 2000) . 
Previous studies started measuring HR using telemetry following MDMA administration 
since the early 1990s. Gordon et al. (1991) wa s the first to show preliminary data using 
telemetry on the effects of MDMA in unstressed and unrestrained animal. However, these 
studies did not measure and compare systemic administration of MDMA and central 
perfusion of MDMA  and MDA  at bioequivalent  doses within the brain  including  
correlatation of  pharmacodynamics responses with changes in striatal extracellular 5 -HT 
concentrations . 
 
Previously, the measurements of body temperature and extracellular neurotransmitters  
levels  have been done in  separate groups of animals  which resulted in diffculties to relate 
thermoregulatory effects with neurochemical effects . This combined technique allows 
continuous simultaneous measurement of core body temperature, heart rate, locomotor 
activity and changes  in extracellular neurotransmitters level. This method is important to 
elucidate the association between acute physiological changes following MDMA 
administration and extracellular neurotransmitters levels  in a specific brain region. Figure 
1.7 show s the advantages of the telemetry and microdialysis techniques. The combined 
technique s provides several advantages over the previous methodological approach. It 
allows the researcher to measure Tc, HR, and LMA without the necessity of handling the Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  43	  rats, t hus eliminating stress and other confounding factors on Tc, HR and LMA. This 
technique allows continuous monitoring and when combined with microdialysis, can be 
used to relate the physiological and behavioural changes to changes in monoamine levels 
in the brain. It is also a simple method with real -time analysis using a smaller number of 
animals which can be used throughout the experiment instead of sacrificing animals at 
each time points for analysis. The dialysates collected by microdialysis can be used t o 
measure endo genous  and exogenous substances in the brain and also free drug 
concentrations. Apart from that, this technique also allows central administration of drug 
into the brain continuously. Overall, the combined telemetry and m icrodialysis techniqu es 
provide  an essential tool to measure MDMA effects on physiological, behavioural and 
neuropharmacological changes.

This study aims to:  
1) Investigate effects of different methods (rectal probe and telemetry) used to 
measure core body temperature and behaviour following MDMA administration  
which are the telemetry and rectal probe ; and  
2) Validate the use of combined telemetry and microdialysis techniques to assess 
MDMA and MDA effects on core body temperature, hea rt rate, locomotor activity 
and 5 -HT extracellular levels  following systemic and central administration . 
The hypotheses for this study are : 
1) MDMA -induced hyperthermia an d behavioural response will  be significant ly 
potentiated  when Tc is measured using rectal probe in comparison to MDMA -
induced hyperthermia and behavioural response when  Tc is measured using 
telemetry.  
2) Use of c ombined telemetry and microdialysis techniques will provide better 
assessment of  measuring and correlat ing physiological changes with  neur ochemical 
changes following systemic administration of MDMA and central administration of 
MDMA and MDA . 
3) Central administration of  MDA will produce potentiated  increase  on physiological 
and neurochemical changes compared t o central administration of  MDMA.

methodological approaches used to measure core body 
temperature  
	  
2.1 INTRODUCTION  
The most commonly used method to assess MDMA effects on core body temperature (Tc) 
in conscious animal model is the rectal probe technique. Rectal temperature measurement 
is usually done via insertion of a rectal probe 5 – 9 cm into the rectum. A study by Lomax 
(1966) has demonstrated the importance of distance for probe insertion. It is shown that a 
distance of 6 to 8 cm was optimal  as body temperature measurements are erroneously low 
and variable  if the distances were less than 5 cm (Lomax, 1966) . Although this technique is 
considered  as simple, less invasive and  does not involve surgery it has been shown to 
produce stress -induced increase in body temperature (Martin et al., 1977; Poole and 
Stephenson, 1977; Gordon, 1990) . 
 
This stress -induced increase in body temperature occurs due to the need of restraining by 
hand or restraining device when measuring body temperature, and intermittent or chronic 
insertio n of the probe into the rectum.  It has  been shown that a single insertion of rectal 
probe for 1 min caused a sustained increase in body temperature of 1°C for about 70 min 
after removal of the probe at ambient temperature of 23°C (Poole and Stephenson, 1977) . 
A study by Gallaher et al. (1985)  has also demonstrated that rectal temperature 
measurement causes ap proximately 1°C increase in body temperature in thermosensor -
implanted rats that did not fully recover for over 3 hours.  
 
Restraining can also affect cardiovascular and behavioural parameters aside from body 
temperature. It was shown that when rats are re strained, it causes significant effects on 
their heart rate and blood pressure (Irvine et al., 1997) . In this study, Irvine et al. (1997)  Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  47	  measured heart rate and blood pressure using telemetry in rats restrained in a plastic tube 
(100mm in diameter). After a brief restraining, blood pressure and heart rate returned to 
normal after 20 and 10 min, respect ively.  This type of restraining is more stressful t han 
restraining during rectal probe measurement . A study by Clement et al. (1989)  has 
demonstrated that handling of mice caused an increase in body temperature and activity in 
transmitter -implanted mice. In the study, mice were removed from the cage and held for 15 
sec as they would be if they were to be injected with a drug. In this study, the increase in 
core body temperature coincided with an increase in activity (Clement et al., 1989) . 
Although the results showed no significant difference in core body temperature between 
the two methods used (rectal pro be and telemetry), it demonstrated that  temperature 
increase, probably the result of handling the mice. However, most studies using animals 
have habituated and handled the animals prior to the start of experiment (48 hours earlier) 
to reduce stress and eliminate confounding factor  (Freezer et al., 2005; Stanley et al., 2007; 
Benamar et al., 2008) . 
 
MDMA administration causes significant change in body temperature and it is important to 
be aware of any confounding factors that could possibly disrupt the mea surement of actual 
MDMA effects during the experiment. It is very important to get accurate reading on core 
body temperature following MDMA administration as this parameter has an impact on 
other parameters such as the magnitude of neurotoxicity. A study b y Malberg and Seiden 
(1998)  which used temperature -sensitive transmitter to measure Tc  have shown that small 
changes in core body temperature produces significant c hanges in long -term neurotoxicity. 
In this study, rats were allowed 1 hour habituation period to prevent hyperthermia induced 
by exploratory locomotion from interfering with the effects of the drug. Then, they were 
treated with 20 or 40 mg/kg MDMA at diffe rent ambient temperatures from 20 to 30°C 
and core body temperature and regional 5 -HT levels (frontal cortex, somatosensory cortex, Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  48	  hippocampus, and striatum) were analyzed as a measure of neurotoxicity. It was shown 
that at ambient temperature of 26 to 30 °C, a decrease level of 5 -HT was observed in long -
term and correlated with core temperature in all brain regions examined  (frontal cortex, 
hippocampus, striatum, and somatosensory cortex) . As mentioned in the previous chapter, 
MDMA administration produces increase in extracellular 5-HT levels . However, stress can 
also cause neurotransmitters release  in the brain.  It has been shown that restraint stress 
significantly increases 5 -HT extracellular levels  in the central nucleus of the amygdala (Mo 
et al., 2008) . In this  study, rats were placed in a restraining tube (6 cm id, 27 cm long) 
which preve nts rats movement for 40 min while dialysates were collected for extracellular 
5-HT measurement (Mo et al., 2 008). As restraint stress could contribute to increase in 
extracellular levels  of 5 -HT in the brain, this effect could potentially lead to stress -induced 
neurotoxicity. It has been demonstrated that administration of 5 mg/kg MDMA i.p. at 
ambient temperature of 24°C produced a significant depletion of 5 -HT and DA in the 
striatum 5 days post -treatment, which was potentiated by pre -exposure to chronic 
unpredictable stress (Johnson and Yamamoto, 2010) . Exposure to chronic restraint stress 
also potentiates metamphetamine induced neurotoxicity in rats (Quinton and Yamamoto, 
2007) . 
 
Although change of acute extracellular levels of 5 -HT in the brain is not used as a marker 
of M DMA -induced neurotoxicity, it is important to have a better understanding of factors 
that influence MDMA -induced acute hyperthermia and this includes changes in 5 -HT 
extracellular levels.  
 
Environmental conditions including low or high ambient temperatures  influence the 
magnitude of changes in body temperature in response to MDMA. These changes are 
relevant to conditions of clubs and raves where the drug is most commonly taken  (Green et Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  49	  al., 2003; Parrott et al., 2008) . In the present study, a high ambient temperature of 29±1°C 
was chosen as it can clearly show the hyperthermic effec t following MDMA. Although a 
number of studies have shown that using rectal probe to measure Tc could result in stress -
induce d increase in  body temperature , no evidence has been presented that compares rectal 
probe measurement and telemetry in rats, especially their application to assess MDMA 
effect on core body temperature.  
 
The aim of this study is to compare two methodological approaches  to assess MDMA 
effect on Tc in rats at high ambient temperature (29 ± 1°C). We have evaluated the effects 
of MDMA on core body temperature using the rectal probe and telemetry. It is 
hypothesized that MDMA -induced hyperthermia will be significantly potent iated when 
measured using rectal probe in comparison to telemetr y. It is also hypothesized that rats 
which Tc  is measured using rectal probe will have a higher behavioural score in 
comparison Tc measured using telemetry following MDMA administration.

2.2.1 Animals  
Male Sprague -Dawley (SD) rats (250 -300 g) were supplied by the Laboratory Animal 
Services, The University of Adelaide (SA, Australia). The rats were housed in groups of 2 -
4 and were kept under a 12 hour light/dark cycle and constant temperature (22ºC) with free 
access to food and water. All procedures of the experiment have been approved by the 
University of Adelaide Animal Ethics Committee and carried out in accordance with 
National Health and Medical Council of Au stralia Guidelines for the Care and Use of 
Laboratory Animals.  
2.2.2 Rectal temperature measurement  
Temperature measurement was performed using a rectal thermometer with digital readout 
(Thermalert TH -8 monitor; Physitemp Instruments, Inc., Clinton, NJ), and a lubricated 
rectal temperature probe with petroleum jelly. Rat was lightly re strained by hand while the 
probe was inserted 5cm into its rectum for 10 sec until a steady reading was obtained. The 
behavioural testing was conducted before body temperatur e measurement every 30 minutes 
to minimise confounding factors due to the need of restraining the rat by hand.  
2.2.3 Radiot elemetry  
Rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (60mg/kg i.p) and placed on water -
heated pad (37ºC) to maintain body temperature . An incision was made below the ribcage 
and the implants were placed into the rats’ abdominal cavity. The implants were stitched to 
the muscle to keep the implants in place. One lead was placed near the chest and held with 
some stitches. Another lead was placed in the back near the shoulder blade and held with 
stitches. The abdominal wall was then stitched and covered with topical antibiotic powder. 
The incision was then closed with suture clips and rats were allowed one -week recovery 
period before further  treatments. After each surgery, the rats’ conditions were recorded in a Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  51	  clinical record sheet (Appendices). The clips were removed 1 or 2 days later. The system 
consists of telemetry devices (TA11CTA -F40, Data Sciences International, USA), which 
measure c ore body temperature (Tc), heart rate (HR) and locomotor activity (LA), as 
reported previously (Jaehne et al., 2005; Bexis and Docherty, 2006; Benamar et al., 2008; 
Huetteman and Bogie, 2009) . The telemetric system also consists of a radio -receiver (RLA 
1020), placed on the bottom of the Perspex bowl during data collection. Radio receivers, 
received information from the implants and transferred it to a computer which recorded the 
data using Da taquest LabPro software (Data Scienc es International, USA). Data were  
recorded every two minutes over the experimental sessions  and presented as mean of 
temperature data 1 -6 minutes .  
2.2.4 Behavioural score  
Behavioural responses were scored using a scale used b y (Molloy and Waddington, 1988) . 
This scale has been used  in previous studies to measure the effects of stimulant drugs on 
the behavioural responses of male Spragu e-Dawley rats, which is similar to the ‘serotonin 
syndrome’ observed in rats. For each observation, the rat’s behaviour was rated and scored. 
The scores for the behavioural responses are as the following: 0 = asleep or inactive; 1 = 
episodes of normal acti vity; 2 = discontinuous activity with bursts of prominent sniffing or 
rearing; 3 = continuous stereotyped behaviour along a fixed path; 4 = continuous 
stereotyped behaviour fixated in one location; 5 = stereotyped behaviour with bursts of 
licking or gnawin g; 6 = continuous licking or gnawing.  
2.2.5 Drug treatments  
MDMA was  given as the hydrochloride salt . Rats were treated with either saline or 
10mg/kg MDMA i.p. and the Tc was measured using either rectal probe or telemetry. The 
rats were placed in the microdial ysis bowl in a room where the ambient temperature was 
maintained at 29ºC , that resulted in MDMA -induced hyperthermia in rats without causing 
fatalities (Green et al., 2003; Jaehne et al., 2005; Stanley et al., 2007) . The rats were Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  52	  allowed 2 hours pretreatment time. For rats which Tc was measured using rectal probe, 
rectal temperature measurement was performed every 30min for 240min. The rats were 
administered with 0.9% saline (1ml/kg) or 10mg/kg MDMA. This systemic do se of 
10mg/kg MDMA has been shown to produce reliable changes in body temperature and 
locomotor activity in rats (Daws et al., 2000; Jaehne et al., 2005; Stanley et al., 2007) , and 
comparable to ‘ecstasy’ used and bl ood concentration found in humans (Green et al., 2003; 
Irvine et al., 2006; Jaehne et al., 2011)  as shown in Table 1.6 . 
2.2.6 Chemicals and reagents  
(±)MDMA was obtained from the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories 
(Sydney, Australia). Chloral hydrate and sodium chloride  were purchased  from BHD 
Laboratory Supplies Pty. Limited (Victoria, Australia).   
2.2.7 Data analysis  
Tc and area under curve (AUC)  were analysed with unpaired t -test and repeated measures 
one-way ANOVA with Tukey post -hoc test  as shown in previous study (Jaehne et al., 
2008) . Due to some missing d ata as a result of a number of rats not surviving the whole 
duration of the experiment, two -way repeated measures ANOVA was not used. All 
relevant data within this study employed two -way repeated measures ANOVA as indicated 
in chapter three. Behavioural re sponse was analysed with unpaired t -test and Kruskal -
Wallis non -parametric test with Dunn’s post -test. All results are presented as mean ± SEM 
and considered statistically significant when P<0.05. All calculations and analysis were 
done using Graph Pad Pri sm software.

2.3.1 Core body temperature  
In both control groups (saline -treated rats), Tc did not showed significant increase or 
decrease when measured with rectal probe or telemetry. Systemic adminis tration of 
10mg/kg MDMA produced  significant increase in Tc in c omparison to control. When Tc 
was measured with rectal probe  (F = 70.94 ), MDMA caused an increase in Tc from 30 min 
(2.408 ± 0.506 °C, P<0.01, n = 6) to 210 min with peak at 60 min post -treatment (3.575 ± 
0.339 °C, P<0.001, n = 6), and then a decrease throughout the experiment to 1°C (Figure 
2.1). When Tc was  measured with telemetry  (F = 39.8 ), MDMA caused a slight decrease in 
Tc at 30 min ( -0.234 ± 0.263 °C), followed by a significant increase at 90 min to 210 min 
with peak at 150 min post -treatment (2.321 ± 0.885 °C, P<0.001, n = 4), and then a 
decrease throughout the experiment to 1.5°C (Figure 2.2). For comparison purposes, the 
data for tel emetry groups taken every 30 minutes  were used for Figure 2.3. In Figure 2.3, 
Tc is sign ificantly higher at 30 and 60 min (P<0.05, n = 4 -6) when measured with rectal 
probe (differences of 2.2°C and 2.3°C, respectively) in comparison to Tc measured with 
telemetry.  Figure 2.3 (B) shows that Tc in MDMA groups were significantly higher than 
their respective saline groups (0 – 240 min). Although AUC for the entire 240 minute time 
course shows no difference between rectal or telemetric recording approaches, the case 
was different if we are looking at temporal effects and onset of MDMA effects between 
these two methods of measurements. Figure 2.3 (C) shows that MDMA caused a higher 
increase in Tc when Tc was measured with rectal probe in comparison to telemetry (0 – 60 
min).  	  Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  54

In control groups, the behavioural score did not showed significant change when measured 
with rectal probe or telemetry. Systemic  adminis tration of 10mg/kg MDMA produced  
significant increase in behavioural score in comparison to control.  Behavioural score in 
rats when  Tc was measured with rectal pro be showed an increase from 30 min (2.833 ± 
0.167, P<0.001, n = 6) to 120 min with pea k at 60 min post -treatment (3.167 ± 0.307, 
P<0.001, n = 6), and then a decrease throughout the experiment to less than 1 (Figure 2.4). 
When Tc was measured with telemetry, behavioural score in rats showed an increase at 30 
min (2.75 ± 0.25, P<0.001, n =4) to 180 min (2.25 ± 0.75, P<0.05, n =4) with a plateau 
from 30 to 120 min and then a decrease throughout the experiment around 2 (Fi gure 2.5). 
In Figure 2.6, when Tc was  measured with rectal probe, rats shows a higher score followed 
by a steep decrease thro ughout the experiment, in comparison to behavioural score when 
rats wa s measured with telemetry. In the telemetry group, the score plateau until 120min 
followed by a gradual decrease throughout the experiment. At 120 min, rats which Tc was 
measured with te lemetry showed significantly higher score (P<0.01, n = 4 -6) than rats 
which Tc was measured with rectal probe  (Figure 2.6). The latter group showed no 
significant difference in behavioural score in comparison to control from 150 min.  Figure 
2.6 (B) shows that behavioural score in MDMA groups were significantly higher than their 
respective saline groups (0 – 240 min). Since there was no significant change in 
behavioural score when Tc was measured using rectal probe in control group in 
comparison to MDMA gro up, this  result suggests that the increased behavioural score  was 
due to MDMA instead of handling the rats.  Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  59

Table 1 shows the survival rate for each group at each time points following treatment. 
Rats in the saline groups showed a 100% survival rate. For MDMA -telemetry group, the 
survival rate at 0 to 180 min was 100%, whereas for MDMA -rectal group the survival rate 
was 100% only from 0 to 120 min. For MDMA -telemetry group, the rate decr eases to 75% 
at 210 to 240 min. For MDMA -rectal group, the rate decreases to 83.33% at 150 min to 
33.33% from 180 to 240 min. Due to ethical reason, the number of rats in MDMA -rectal 
group was not increased.

In the current study, it has been  demonstrated that MDMA produced  significant increase in 
Tc and behavioural score in comparison to control. Tc in rats measured using rectal probe 
showed a significant increase at 30 and 60 min post -treatment in comparison to Tc in rats 
measured using telemetry.  Behavioural score in rats  when  Tc is measured with telemetry 
showed a higher score at 120 min post -treatment in comparison to rats which Tc is 
measured with rectal p robe. When  Tc was measured with rectal probe, the survival rate 
was lower than rats which Tc was measured with telem etry in MDMA -treated rats . 
 
This study has demonstrated that the timing of the onset and profile of  MDMA -induced 
hyperthermia were different when  measured with  rectal probe and telemetry (Figure 2.3). 
Although the maximum core temperature change was simila r regardless of the temperature 
recording technique, use of rectal probe  resulted  in a faster onset of  temperature increase  
following MDMA administration  (at 30 min) and peak increase (at 60 min) in comparison 
to rats which when Tc wa s measured using telem etry, 90 min and 150 min, respectively. 
This is possibly due continuous handling when measuring Tc throughout the experiment  
and enhance d effects of MDMA on body temperature in restrained rats . The result of this 
study is consistent with other reports  demo nstrating the importance of identifying factors 
that might influence measurement of body temperature including stress  (Clement et al., 
1989; Gordon, 1990; van den Buuse, 1994) .  
 
A previous study has also demonstrated enhance d effects of drugs in restrained rats in 
comparison to free -moving rats. A study by Martin et al. (1977)  showed restrain alters the 
effects of morphine and heroin on Tc in rats.  In the study, rats were treated with 5, 15 and 
30 mg/kg morphine, or 0.1, 1 and 5 mg/kg heroin, in which the administration of 5 mg/kg 
of heroin or 30 mg/kg of morphine caused hypothermia in restrained rats and hyperthermia Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  64	  in unrestrained rats (Martin et al., 1977) . These  results suggest that handling rats  can alter 
the animal’s Tc response to the drugs.  However, the type of restraint us ed by Martin e t al., 
(1977) was different than that  report ed in the current study. In our  study, the rats were 
slightly restrained by hands for a few seconds to measure rectal temperature. Our results 
have demonstrated that  slightly restrained rats in the control group did not display  
significant change in body temperature, but with the administration of MDMA  the changes 
in Tc were potentitated in rats which were slightly restrained. The Tc in rats measured with 
telemetry initially showed hypothermia although not signifi cant following MDMA 
administration , followed by a gradual increase in Tc. It is important to get an accurate 
reading of Tc, especially during the first hour as MDMA administration has been reported 
to produce marked hyperthermia with a peak at 40 to 60 min  post -treatment (Colado et al., 
1993; Dafters, 1994; Malberg et al., 1996; Malberg and Seiden, 1998; O'Shea et al., 1998; 
Stanley et al., 2007) . In a study by O’Shea et al. (1998)  which used a thermocouple rectal 
probe to measure Tc , administration  of 10mg/kg MDMA (i.p.) produced a  significant 
increase in Tc of 1.5°C, peak at 60 min post -treatment. Thus, the use of an appropriate 
method to measure Tc can prevent confounding effects of restraining on Tc following 
MDMA administration, especially at the onset of effects.  
 
It has also been demonstrated in this study that use of rectal probe resulted a lower survival 
rate compared to Tc was meas ured with telemetry . This finding suggests that rats exposed 
to stress were more susceptible to death than stress -free rats when chal lenged with a drug 
known to increase body temperature.  These results are  consistent with Gallaher et al. 
(1985) who demonstrated that  animals with  1°C rise in bo dy temperature  did not recover 
fully when measured with rect al probe.  
 Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  65	  This study has also dem onstrated that the temperature recording technique influenced the 
profile of MDMA -induced increase in behavioural activity. Although Tc within the rectal 
group was measured after behavioural recording, subsequent behavioural testing was still 
influenced by  the previous Tc measurement which involved restraining the rat by hand. 
When Tc w as measured with telemetry, animals  showed  significant ly greater  increases in 
behavioural activity a nd stereotypical 5 -HT – related  behaviours  in comparison to rats 
when  T c  w as measured with rectal probe  at 120 min post -treatment .  The elavation of 
extracellular 5 -HT is  associated with a condition known as ‘serotonin syndrome’ which has 
been reported both in humans (Gillman, 1999)  and animals (Grahame -Smith, 1971a) , 
caused by monoamine oxidase inhibitors, SSRI, drug interactions, and drugs that prevent 
clearance and of 5 -HT and its metabolism (Stanley et al., 2007) . When Tc was measured 
with telemetry  following MDMA administration , the behavioural activity  increased  and 
maintained at a higher score ( 30 min to 240 min ), than rats which Tc was measured wit h 
recta l probe (immediate peak at  60 min followed by a steep decrease to 150 min ). This 
pattern with the rectal probe group was similar to that reported by Stanley et al. (2007)  
which demonstrated that MDMA –treated rats began to show signs of heat stress and a 
significant decrease in their activity until 150 min which they were completely inact ive. 
The steep decrease in behavioural s core in the rectal probe group wa s also probably due to 
depletion of energy during the first 2 hours of the treatment to accommodate increase in 
locomotion and heat dissipation (Gordon, 1990; Green et al., 2003; Cadet et al., 2007; 
Gordon, 2007; Kiyatkin, 2007 ). 
 
Results  of this study demonstrated  the importance of obtaining more accurate readings of  
core body temperature following MDMA administration. It can be observed in this  study 
that when MDMA -treated rats were handled for rectal temperature measurement, it 
resulted in a high behavioural score  and could be attributed  to increase d extracellular levels  Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  66	  in 5-HT in specific  brain regions (Spanos and Yamamoto, 1989; Greene et al., 2008) . A 
study by Baumann et al. (2008)  has shown that stereotypy w as strongly correlated with  
levels of dialysate 5 -HT in a n umber of brain regions including  the striatum, and with 
dialysate DA in nucleus accumbens and striatum. In this study, it was also shown that in 
the rectal probe group, the behavioural response showed a steep decrease  throughout the 
experiment when  rats be came inactive. The findings in the current study indicates that 
potentiated MDMA effects on  Tc when measuring Tc using rectal probe  causes a higher 
behavioural response  which possibly correlate with increase in extracellular levels  of 5-HT 
in the br ain (Spanos and Yamamoto, 1989) . 
 
Telemetry has some limitation including the requirement for surgery and it is costly  
compared to rectal probe technique . Even though telemetry is costly in comparison to 
rectal thermometer, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. A number of studies have 
started using telemetry for the past few decades, especially to measure physiological 
parameters. As a technique that eliminates restraining stress, telemetry provides an 
alternativ e that can be used to support  studies which used conventional  method. The results 
of this study provide the practical application of telemetry in measuring Tc, over 
conventional method using rectal probe. The use of telemetry has several advantages, 
primarily the ability to record Tc without producing confounding effects which allow more 
quality and quantity of data collection. It provides a better representation of MDMA effects 
on Tc without producing stress when han dling the animals or repeated insertion of rectal 
probe during a long duration of experiment, more time efficient in data collection and 
analysis, and provides a more thorough time profile of MDMA effects in animals. Our 
results demonstrate that telemetry is a valid technique and  provides a better approach to 
record core body temperature, and also other parameters in small animals than the 
conventional method. 	  Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  67	  Chapter  3  The effects of systemic administration of MDMA,

3.1 INTRODUCTION  
It has been suggested that MDMA metabolism plays a major contribution to some of the 
adverse  e f f e c t s  of MDMA  (Esteban et al., 2001; Nixdorf et al., 2001; Goni -Allo et al., 
2008a) . This is mainly due to involvement of several pathways of MDMA metabolism 
with a number of metabolites form ing toxic conjugates (Hiramatsu et al., 1990; Green et 
al., 2003; de la Torre and Farre, 2004; Erives et al., 2008) . MDA is a major metabolite of 
MDMA and plasma levels in rats rise rapidly in a parallel manner and plateau between 1 
and 3 h after MDMA administration (Colado et al., 19 95; Chu et al., 1996 ). MDA 
increases locomotor activity (Yeh and Hsu, 1991) , more potent at producing 5 -HT-
mediated behaviour (Hiramatsu et al., 1989) , induces hyperthermia in rats and mice 
(Colado et al., 1995; Bexis and Docherty, 2006)  and induces 5 -HT and dopamine release  
(Nash and Brodkin, 1991; O'Loinsigh et al., 2001) . A study  by Fonsart et al . (2008) found 
a higher hyperthermia response in male rats followin g systemic administration of 10mg/kg 
MDA (~4.3°C) than 20mg/kg MDMA (~3.2°C) 1h after drugs administration. Colado et al. 
(1995) also observed a higher MDA -induced hyperthermia (~2.7°C) than MDMA -induced 
hyperthermia (~1.0°C) 1h after systemic administration of 10mg/kg MDA and MDMA, 
respectively. A study by Goni -Allo et al. (2008b)  has shown that the period of temperature 
elevation following systemic MDMA administration parallels the increased in plasma 
concentrations of MDA, which suggests a role for MDA in MDMA -induced hyperthermia. 
A study by Bexis and Docherty (2006)  has shown that MDA increases heart rate more than 
MDMA at identical doses (20mg/kg, i.p.). This is probably due to the agonist action of Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  68	  MDA at 5 -HT 2B receptors (Setola et al., 2003) , which potentiate the cardiac effects of 
MDA (Droogmans et al., 2007) .  
 
Although MDMA -induced hyperthermia and neurotoxicity have been previously 
demonstrated following systemic MDMA administration,  perfusion of MDMA in rats into 
hippocampus (Molliver et al., 1986; Esteban et al., 2001)  including MDA (Molliver et al., 
1986)  and striatum (Goni -Allo et al., 2008b)  failed to cause h yperthermia and 
neurotox icity. Direct injection of MDMA into the brain failed to rep roduce the adverse 
effects demonstrated  following systemic administration of MDMA (Molliver et al., 1986; 
Paris and Cunningham, 1990; Esteban et al., 2001; Nix dorf et al., 2001; Goni -Allo et al., 
2008a ). Previous studies that administer MDMA centrally into the brain  used a 
concentration of 100µM MDMA which is comparable to the concentration found in the 
brain following systemic administration of 10mg/kg MDMA (i.p.) (Molliver et al., 1986; 
Paris and Cunningham, 1990; Esteban et al., 2001; Nixdorf et al., 2001; Goni -Allo et al., 
2008a ). In a study by Goni -Allo et al. (2008), perfusion of 100µM of MDMA did not  alter 
core body temperature nor cause  depletion of 5 -HT neu rons. Yet, combined perfusion of 
100µM MDMA directly into the brain and 3 X 5mg/kg MDMA (i.p.) produced acute 
hyperthermia and neuronal 5-HT loss in the striatum. These findings suggest  that 
peripheral generation of active metabolites contributes to MDMA -induced hyperthermia 
and the importance of metabolism to produce MD MA-induce d hyperthermia and long -term 
damage of serotonergic neurons .  
 
Additionally, a lthough there were many studies looking at the effects of central 
administration of MDA and its metabolites on the development of ne urotoxicity, the 
findings on acute effects of MDA such as hyperthermia is sparse. Moreover,  systemic 
MDA administration produces significantly higher hyper thermia (Fonsart et al., 2008) , Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  69	  heart rate  (HR)  and locomotor activity  (LMA)   than MDMA  at similar doses in rats 
(Colado et al., 1995; Bexis and Docherty, 2006) . MDA is also available in the drug  market 
either as itself or as ‘ecstasy’ (Pentney, 2001)  and it is postulated that MDA users will 
experience worse adverse effects compared to MDMA users based on the findings on 
animal studies (Fonsart et al., 2008) . 
 
Previous microdialysis studies were conducted in the  dorsal striatum as this region is 
important for locomotion and cognition function, and has a large size and easily accessible 
by dialysis probe (Li et al., 2006) . The behavioural effects of MDMA are also partially 
mediated by 5 -HT release  in the striatum (Dafters and Lynch, 1998; Shankaran and 
Gudelsky, 1999; Mechan et al., 2002) . Striatum has also been implicated in MDMA -
induced hyperthermia and changes in 5 -HT extracellular levels  (Malberg et al., 1996; 
Malberg and Seiden, 1998) . It was assumed that increase in 5 -HT extracellular levels  in 
one brain region reflects extracellular levels  in other brain regions (Rodsiri et  al., 2011 ), 
hence no previous studies have compared 5 -HT extracellular levels  using microdialysis 
following systemic administration of MDMA in seve ral brain regions and correlated  them 
to physiological effects of MDMA. Striatum  is unique compare d to hippocampus due to 
the interplay between dopaminergic and serotonergic neurochemistry especially in the 
presence of MDMA. It is important to measure the dynamics of extracellular 5 -HT changes 
between MDMA and MDA after central administration, especial ly when locomotor 
activity and heart rate are measured in the present study. It is also important to perfuse 
MDMA and MDA centrally to the striatum to eliminate peripheral metabolism  
confounding the interpretation of effects.  This approach  is also important to elucidate the 
brain regions responsible for MDMA  and MDA -induced adverse effects especially 
hyperthermia, and/or the possible role of the active metabolite, MDA in mediating these 
effects.  The present study was done using awake animals rather than anaesthetized animals  Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  70	  which is a more accurate representation of 5 -HT extracellular levels in the brain.  Since the 
concentration of 5 -HT increase immediately after probe implantation, the rats were 
allowed 48 hours recovery period before initiation of  experiment.  
 
In the current study, we used combined telemetry and microdialysis techniques to measure 
the effects of MDMA on core body temperature, heart rate, locomotor activity, and striatal 
5-HT extracellular levels . The telemetr y system prevents from the confounding effects of 
handling on Tc, HR and LMA, whereas the microdialysis technique allows continuous 
central perfusion of MDMA and MDA  and collection  dialysates to measure  changes in 
brain  neurotransmitters concentrations using High Performance Liquid Chromatography 
(HPLC) with electrochemical detection (ED) (Myers et al., 1998) . The purpose of this 
study is to compare and contrast the concurrent p harmacodynamics responses 
(temperature, heart rate, and locomotor activity) between  central ly administered  M D M A  
and MDA and peripheral administration of MD MA, at bioequivalent doses in awake 
animals at high ambient temperature. It is hypothesised that central perfusion of MDMA 
into the striatum will not cause significant increase in Tc  and HR, as systemic 
administration of MDMA, and central administration of MDA will produce significant 
increase in Tc, HR, LMA and striatal 5 -HT in comparison to central administration of 
MDMA.

3.2.1 Animals  
Supply of an imals and methods  were as described in Chapter 2.  
3.2.2 Radiotelemetry  
Supply of animals and methods were as descr ibed in Chapter 2.  
3.2.3 Brain surgery for probe implantation  
After one -week recovery period following the telemet ry implant surgery, rats underwent  
probe implantation surgery. Rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg 
i.p) and placed on water heated pad (37ºC) to maintain body temperature. Once the rat was 
fully anesthetized, t he rat’s head was secured in a stereotaxic frame  (Kopf Instruments, 
Tujunga, CA, USA) and an intercerebral guide cannula (BAS MD -2251, Bioanalytical 
System Inc., West Lafayette, IN, USA) was implanted into the striatum and held with 
dental cement (Vertex, Dentimex BV HJ Zeist, Netherlands). The coordina tes of the 
striatum are AP: +1.2 mm and L: +2.2 mm from bregma and D: -5.5 mm from dura, which 
was referred from a rat brain atlas (Paxinos and Watson, 1986) . Rats were allowed to 
recover on the 37ºC heated pad until they regain full consciousness and were placed 
individually in a clear Perspex observation bowl (BAS “Bee -keeper” rodent assistance). A 
further 48 hours recov ery was allowed before the telemetry and microdialysis sampling 
commenced to ensure that the neurotransmitter levels are stable and to minimize tissue 
damage from the surgery (Westerink, 2000; Esteban et al., 2001; O'Sh ea et al., 2005 ). 
Animals were given ad libitum  access to food and water.  
3.2.4 Experimental protocol  
Following the 48 hours recovery period, rats were lightly restrained by hand and the 
microdialysis probe (2mm membrane, BAS MD -2200, Bioanalytical Systems Inc., 
Indiana, USA) was inserted through the guide cannula into the striatum. The animals were Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  72	  then placed in a room where the T a was maintained at high (29ºC) T a. Experiments were 
conducted at ambient temperature of 29°C in order to mimic the hot conditi ons that 
MDMA users may be exposed to at raves or nightclubs. Artificial cerebrospinal fluid 
(aCSF) (in mM: NaCl 125, KCl 2.5, MgCl 2.6H 2O 1.18, Na 2HPO 4 2.0 and CaCl 2.2H 2O 1.2 
adjusted to pH 7.4) was perfused for 2 h at a flow rate of 1.5 µl/min. The first two samples 
following probe insertion were discarded and the next two 30 minutes samples were used 
as baseline samples. The probe was then perfused with either aCSF (control), MDMA 
(100µM) or MDA (5µM) for 300 minutes. For systemic (i.p) administration, 0. 9% saline 
(dose volume 1mg/ml) or 10mg/kg MDMA was administered. Dialysates were collected 
through the same guide cannula every 30 minutes into Eppendorf tube containing 10 µl of 
2% acetic acid. Radio receivers, placed on the bottom of the microdialysis bo wl, received 
information from the implants and transferred it to a computer which recorded the data 
using Dataquest LabPro software (Data Sciences International). Temperature change (Tc), 
heart rate (HR) and locomotor activity (LA) were recorded via teleme try every two 
minutes over the experimental period.  
3.2.5 High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with electrochemical 
detection (ED)  
The system consists of a controller (Decade II; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), VP auto injector 
(Shimadzu SIL -10AD), VP liquid chromatograph (LC -10AD), degasser (Shimadzu DGU -
14A) and BAS LC -4B (Bioanalytical Systems). The mobile phase for MDMA and MDA 
was composed of sodium acetate 0.1M (pH 4.25) and 12.5% methanol (adjusted according 
to (Michel et al., 1993) . It was filtered, degassed and delivered at a flow rate of 1.18 
ml/min. Alltima HP C18 3 µ 100×2.1mm column (Alltech Associates, Inc., NSW, 
Australia) is used to separate MDMA an d MDA. The mobile phase for 5 -HT and 5 -HIAA 
was composed of (in mM) NaH 2PO 4 102.9, octanesulfonic acid 1.0, ethylenediamine 
tetraacetic acid (EDTA) 0.1 (adjusted to pH 3.8) and 12.5% methanol and injected at a Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  73	  flow rate of 0.7 ml/min with working electrode potential set at 0.7V with a range of 100pA 
(Callaghan et al., 2006) . An Ultrasphere ODS 250× 4.6mm column (Beckman Coulter, 
USA) was used for 5 -HT and 5 -HIAA separation. Data were recorded using the LC 
Solution programme (Shimadzu).  
3.2.6 Reverse dialysis recovery  
Reverse dialysis were done to estimate the extracellular concentration of MDMA and 
MDA in  the striatum following drugs administration by assessing the ability of the probe 
to recover MDMA and MDA in vitro from solutions containing selected concentrations of 
these drug s. The probe was perfused with 100µM MDMA or 5µM MDA. The drugs were 
perfused  using an automated syringe (‘Bee Stinger’, Bioanalytical Systems) at 1µl/min. 
Dialysates were collected every 30 min into an Eppendorf tube for 300 min. Samples were 
analysed with HPLC -ED to determ ine MDMA and MDA concentration. The percentage of 
recovery  was calculated from the original solution of the drugs in the syringe.  MDMA and 
MDA peak area was compared to a previously acquired standard curve to obtain an 
apparent concentration.  
3.2.7 Drugs preparation and administration  
MDMA and MDA were given as the hy drochloride salt and were dissolved in aCSF to 
give concentrations of 100 µM MDMA and 5 µM MDA, respectively. MDMA 
concentration in the perfusate was chosen based on previous studies which shows this 
concentration resulted in the same extracellular concentra tion of MDMA in the brain 
(~11µM) following systemic dose of 10 mg/kg MDMA (Esteban et al ., 2001). This 
systemic dose also produces reliable changes in body temperature and locomotor activity 
in rats without causing fatalities (Daws et al., 2000; Jaehne et al., 2005; Stanley et al., 
2007) . The dose is comparable to ‘ecstasy’ used in humans  which is about 100 to 150mg  
(Green et al., 2003)  and produces blood c oncentration in the rat similar to those found in 
human s (Irvine et al., 2006; Jaehne et al., 2011) . In human, the plasma concentration of Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  74	  MDA following 1mg/kg (43 to 106mg) and 1.6mg/kg (69 to 150mg) MDMA is 7.5ng/m l 
and 12.5ng/ml, respectively (Kolbrich et al., 2008) . Previous studies which measured peak 
MDA concentration in the plasma following systemic MDMA administration found ~200 
ng/ml (0.9µM) MDA in Flinders Sensitive Li ne (FSL) rats (Jaehne et al., 2011)  and 
~350ng/ml MDA in male Wistar rats (Goni -Allo et al., 2008b)  following 7.5mg/kg 
MDMA (i.p.), and ~200ng/ml MDA in male Sprague -Dawley rat s (Baumann et al., 2009)  
following 10mg/kg MDMA (i.p.).  Following 7.5mg/kg MDMA (i.p.), the brai n Cmax of 
MDA was ~4000ng/g (Jaehne et al., 2011) , whereas 10mg/kg MDMA (oral) produces 
3µg/ml (0.0139nM) MDA in the brain (Upreti and Eddington, 20 08). We also did an in 
vitro  recovery of central MDMA and MDA and found about 10% of the drugs were 
delivered by the probe  (Figure 3.1). From these finding s, we chose  a concentration of 5µM 
MDA to be administered centrally to the brain. The present stud y is the first study which 
uses microdialysis for contin uous perfusion of MDA into a specific region in the brain.  
3.2.8 Chemicals and reagents  
 (±)MDMA and  ( ±)MDA were obtained from the Australian Government Analytical 
Laboratories (Sydney, Australia). 5 -HT, 5 -HIAA, sodium salt of octanesulfonic acid and 
disodium salt of EDTA were purchased from Sigma -Aldrich Co. Ltd (St. Louis, USA). 
Chloral hydrate, sodium ch loride, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, disodium 
hydrogen orthophosphate, sodium dihydrogen orthophosphate, acetic acid and methanol

3.2.9 Data analysis  
Core body temperat ure, heart rate, locomotor activity and changes in 5 -HT and 5 -HIAA 
levels were analysed with repeated measures two -way ANOVA with treatment and time as 
main factors, with Bonferroni post hoc test. The mean 5 -HT level from the two samples 
obtained before tr eatment was used to determine the baseline value and calculate any 
subsequent change for each rate as a percentage of this baseline value. Area under the Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  75	  curve (AUC) for each treatment group was calculated from -30 to 300 min and compared 
with one -way ANOV A with Tukey post -hoc test. Due to its non -parametric nature, 
behavioural data were analyzed using a Kruskal -Wallis test followed by Dunn’s post -test. 
All results are presented as mean ± SEM and considered statistically significant when 
P<0.05. All calcula tions and analysis were done using Graph Pad Prism software.  
 
3.3 RESULTS  
3.3.1 HPLC  
Validity of the HPLC assay was tested by analysis of intra -day and inter -day variances  
(Table 3.1) . Accuracy = (Estimated value – nominal value)/Nominal value X 100. 
Precision = (SD/mean) X 100. Nominal value is the known concentration. Coefficient 
values (r2) for MDMA and MDA, determined from the calibration curve were 0.9999 and 
0.9968, respectively. Coeffi cient values for 5 -HT and 5 -HIAA were 0.9854 and 1.000, 
respectively (n =  4).  
3.3.2 Reverse dialysis recovery for 100µM MDMA and 5µM MDA  	  
In vitro recovery  (Figure 3.1)  for MDMA was 10.41 ± 0.37% whereas for MDA i t was 
11.22 ± 0.51% .  
3.3.3 Core body temperature  
Figure 3.2 (a) shows the effects of treatment on Tc. A two -way ANOVA showed a 
significant interaction effect (P<0.0001, F = 14.23) and significant effects of treatment 
(P<0.0001, F = 22.83) and time (P< 0.0001, F = 10.61). Only systemic administration of 
10mg/kg MDMA produces significant increase in Tc in comparison to control (P< 0.001). 
MDMA caused an increase in Tc from 30 min (1.094 ± 0.304 °C) onwards with peak at 78 
min post -treatment (3.376 ± 0.306 °C), resulting in a temperature change of +3.467 °C 
from 0 min and then decreases throughout the experiment. Both central perfusion of Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  76	  MDMA and MDA did not induced significant changes in Tc in comparison to the control 
group. Figure 3.2 (b) shows that AUC of Tc in rats treated with systemic administratio n of 
MDMA significantly increased compared to control ( -30–300 min).

produces significant increase in HR in comparison to control (P<0.001). MDMA caused an 
increase in HR from 18 min (415.489 ± 10.787 bpm) onwards with peak at 78 min pos t-
treatment (527.873 ± 24.979 bpm) and then decreases throughout the experiment. Both

(P<0.0001, F = 1149.65) and time (P< 0.0001, F = 22.30). Only systemic administration of 
10mg/kg MDMA produces significant increase in LMA in comparison to control 
(P<0.001). MDMA caused an increase in LMA from 12 min (13.625 ± 8.518 cpm ) to 150 
min with peak at 60 min post -treatment (51.875 ± 7.704 cpm) and then decreases

3.3.7 Extracellular 5 -HT and 5 -HIAA concentrations  
A mean basal level of 5-HT in the striatum dialysates was 1.265 ± 0.087 pg/µl (n = 4 -5). 
Figure 3.5 (a) shows the effects of 10mg/kg MDMA, 100µM MDMA and 5µM MDA on 
5-HT extracellular levels  in the stria tum. A two -way ANOVA showed a significant 
interaction effect (P<0.0 1, F = 2.15 ) and no significan t effect of treatment (P>0.05, F = 
2.52) and significant effect of time (P< 0.05, F = 1.99 ). Data are expressed as dialysate 5 -
HT (% of baseline) ± standard error of mean (S.E.M.) and as AUC 0 – 300 min following 
treatment. Syste mic MDMA administration produced  a significant increase in 5 -HT 
extracellular levels  (378.465 ± 133.169 peak 60 min, P<0.01, n = 4) in comparison to 
control. Central  perfusion o f MDMA also produced  a significant increase in 5 -HT 
extracellular levels  (320.435 ± 71.050 peak 150 min, P<0.05, n = 5). Meanwhile, central 
perfusion of MDA did not produce significant change in 5 -HT extracellular levels . The 
AUC of 5 -HT resp onse (bottom) shows significant difference between MDMA and the Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  82	  control group at high Ta (P<0.05). For 5 -HIAA, a mean basal level in the striatum 
dialysates was 14.004 ± 3.52 pg/µl (n = 4 -5). Figure 3.6 (a) shows the effects of 10mg/kg 
MDMA, 100µM MDMA an d 5µM MDA on 5 -HIAA extracellular levels  in the striatum. A 
two-way ANOVA showed a significant interaction effect (P<0.0 5, F = 1.55) and no 
significan t effect of treatment (P>0.05, F = 0.59 ) and significant effect of time (P< 0.0001, 
F = 4.39 ). Data are expressed as dialysate 5 -HIAA (% of baseline) ± standard error of 
mean (S.E.M.) and as AUC 0 – 300 min following treatment. Only central perfusion of 
MDA produces a significant increase in 5 -HIAA extracellular levels  (124.856 ± 24.884 
peak 210 min, n = 5).

This study used combined telemetry and microdialysis techniques at high ambient 
temperature to compare the effects of systemic administration and central perfusi on of 
MDMA and to investigate the effects of central perfusion of MDMA and MDA into the 
striatum, and on Tc, HR, and LMA, and related the changes to striatal 5 -HT extracellular 
levels . Our study has demonstrated that systemic administration of 10mg/ kg (i.p.) MDMA 
cause a significant increase in Tc, HR, and LMA in comparison to control whereas central 
perfusion of 100µM MDMA do not produce any significant changes to Tc, HR and LMA. 
It was also shown that MDMA administered systemically (10mg/kg, i.p.) and centrally 
(100µM) produce significant striatal 5 -HT extracellular levels . Central perfusion of 5µM 
MDA into the striatum did not produce significant change in the parameters measured  but 
causes an increase in 5 -HIAA extracellular levels . These MDMA res ults suggested that 
there was no direct association between the physiological parameters and extracellular 5 -
HT levels  in the striatum.  
 
Systemic MDMA administration caused significant increase in Tc, and this result was 
comparable to previous studies which found hyperthermia following systemic MDMA 
(10mg/kg i.p.) administration (Green et al., 2003; Stanley et al., 2007) . The peak increase 
in Tc at 60 min was consistent with peak MDMA concentration in the brain measured by 
Esteban e t al. (2001)  follo wing systemic administration of 10mg/kg MDMA (i.p.), 
although the experiment was undertaken at normal ambient temperature. Since MDMA 
blocks the rat tail vasodilatory heat loss mechanism (Blessing et al., 2003)  and affects other 
physiological mechanisms associated with thermoregulation (Gordon et al., 1991) , it is 
expected that rats demonstrate hyperthermic responses in a hot ambient temperature 
environment. MDMA disrupts thermoregulation which can produce hypothermia and 
hyperthermia effects at normal and high  ambient temperature conditions (Malberg and Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  86	  Seiden, 1998; Daws et al., 2000; Bexis et al., 2004) . MDMA -induced hyperthermia in rats 
is thought to be mediated through its actions as 5 -HT 1A receptor agonist and a 5 -HT 2A 
receptor antagonist (Blessing et al., 2003; Blessing, 2005) , which indicate the involvement 
of the serotonergic system in mediating hyperthermia. Activation of 5 -HT 2A receptors 
increase d Tc and substantially reduc ed tail temperature and blood flow. Meanwhile, 5 -
HT 1A receptors controls sympathetic outflow to the cutaneous vascular bed (Blessing, 
2005) .  
 
Central perfusion of 100µM MDMA did not produce significant change in Tc.  The 
concentration of MDMA used in the present study has been shown to produce extracellular 
concentration of MDMA similar to those found following systemic administration of 
10mg/kg i.p. MDMA (Esteban et al., 2001; Nix dorf et al., 2001; Goni -Allo et al., 2008a ) 
and produced an increase in striatal extracellular DA similar to that found after 
administration of 10mg/kg MDMA i.p. (Nixdorf et a l., 2001 ). Our result was consistent 
with previous study by Nixdorf et al. (2001)  and Goni -Allo et al. (2008a)  which found no 
significant change in body temperature following central perfusion of 100µM MDMA i nto 
the striatum. The lack of significant hyperthermia in the present study following central 
perfusion of MDMA as compared to what is usually observed following systemic MDMA 
adminstration suggests that peripheral metabolism of MDMA and the formation of 
metabolites are important factors that result in the acute hyperthermic response. A study by 
Goni -Allo et al. (2008a)  found no significant change in body temperature in male Wistar 
rats following 5h intrastriatal perfusion of 100µM MDMA at ambient temperature of 
21.5°C but an increase in body temperature following intrastriatal perfusion of 100µM 
MDMA and systemic admini stration of 3×5mg/kg (i.p) MDMA at the same time. In this 
study we also perfused MDA centrally into the striatum which resulted in no signi ficant 
change in Tc . This result was different from those found following systemic MDA Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  87	  administration of 10 mg/kg i.p . and 20 mg/kg i.p. (Colado et al., 1995; Bexis and 
Docherty, 2006) . MDA shares similar propertie s with MDMA in terms of causing  acute 
hyperthermia at the same dose with MDMA (Colado et al., 1995; Bexis and Docherty, 
2006 ). Systemic administration of 20mg/kg MDA (s.c) at room temperature to male Wistar 
rats produced initial hypothermia followed by significant inc rease in core body  
temperature , peak at 180 min after administration (Bexis and Docherty, 2006) .  
 
In the present study, systemic MDMA administration increased heart rate in conscious rats 
in comparison to control. However, central perfusion of MDMA and MDA did not produce 
significant change in HR. Cardiovascular physiology is important to mammals espec ially 
when adaptation to ambient temperature is involved (Jaehne et al., 2008) . Chambers et al. 
(2000)  demonstrated that cardiovascular responses to ambient temperature are closely 
related to the mech anism for heat production in rats. As seen in the present study, MDMA, 
which has cardiac stimulant effects can lead to tachycardia and arrhythmia (Gordon et al., 
1991 ). It has been shown that MDMA acts as an agonist at both α 1- and α 2- 
adrenoreceptors, as well as 5 -HT 2 receptors to increase blood pressure in anaesthetized rats 
(McDaid and Docherty, 2001) .  
 
Systemic MDMA administration causes an increase in LMA which corresponds to increase 
in Tc and HR. MDMA produces acute, dose -dependant hyperlocomotor response 
accompanied by the major behavioural features of the serotonin syndrome (Spanos and 
Yamamoto, 1989; Colado et al., 1993) , although serotonin syndrome was not quantified in 
the present study . The 5 -HT syndrome included enhanced locomotor activity, head -
weaving, forepaw treading, piloerection, penile erection, proptosis, ejaculation, salivation, 
and defecation (Spanos and Yamamoto, 1989 ). The enhanced locomotor effects following 
MDMA administration was believed to be associated with MDMA -induced 5 -HT Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  88	  extracellular levels  in the brain (Baumann et al., 2008) . However, a study by Rodsiri et al. 
(2011)  has shown that the binge dosing of 6mg/kg MDMA produced an increase in LMA 
without significant concomitant increase in extracellular 5 -HT. This result could be due to 
the brain region in which 5 -HT was measured, as the study measured 5 -HT extracellular 
levels  in the hipp ocampus which may play a minor role in mediating locomotion 
hyperactivity effects in comparison to the striatum. However, it has also been shown by 
previous studies that increase in LMA was not related to 5 -HT extracellular levels  (Dafters, 
1994; O'Shea et al., 2005) . In the present study, central perfusion of MDMA and MDA did 
not produce significant change in LMA as seen following systemic MDMA administration 
even though it was administered into the striatum, a brain  region which is responsible for 
modulating locomotion. It is postulated that MDMA -induced increase in LMA involves 
combined effects of MDMA within several brain regions instead of MDMA action on the 
striatum alone. Other brain region such as the nucleus a ccumbens also plays an important 
role in mediating locomotion effects (Melega et al., 1995; Jones et al., 1996; Jones et al., 
1999) . There is also evidence suggesting activation of multiple 5 -HT receptors by an 
interaction of DA and 5 -HT (Bankson and Cunningham, 2002; Green et al., 2003) . The 
present study did not include measurement of striatal extracellular levels of dopamine. 
Although we realize the importance of measuring st riatal extracellular levels of dopamine 
in relation to MDMA -induced increase in LMA, the HPLC assay method used in this study 
was primarily optimised for 5 -HT and 5 -HIAA analysis. Due to low volume of dialysates, 
it was not possible to conduct further HPLC  assay specifically optimised for dopamine and 
DOPAC.  
 
In the present study, central perfusion of 5µM MDA results in a significant increase in 5 -
HIAA extracellular levels with no significant change in extracellular 5 -HT levels. It has 
been described previo usly that MDA has a higher potency at several brain regions than Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  89	  MDMA to induce 5 -HT release, hence resulted in decrease in 5 -HT and 5 -HIAA 
concentrations. The present study is the first to observe a significant increase of 5 -HIAA 
extracellular levels in t he striatum following central perfusion of MDA. This could be 
explained due to less potent effect of MDA on MAO, which resulted in more 5 -HT be ing 
metabolized to 5 -HIAA, although this has not been reported in previous literatures.  
 
The lack of hyperthermia  following central perfusion of MDMA and MDA shown in the 
present study could be due to several reasons. The first reason is that MDMA metabolites 
other than MDA could potentially cause the hyperthermic response seen following 
systemic MDMA administration.  As mentioned previously, MDMA is metabolized via N -
demethylenation to MDA and via O-demethylenation to HHA, O-demethylenation to 
HHMA and subsequently to HMMA. Although there was limited finding on the effects of 
MDMA metabolites in MDMA -induced hyperthermia, these metabolites have been shown 
to produce MDMA -induced neurotoxicity. A study by Goni -Allo et al. (2008a)  has 
demonstrated that O-demethyl enation of HHMA and MDA to HMMA and HMA, 
respectively were inhibited by entacapone pretreatment, but plasma concentrations of 
HHMA and HHA were unchanged suggesting they were not solely metabolized via O -
demethylenation pathway. HHMA and HHA are unstable c atechols that can form 
conjugates with GSH that have been related to neurotoxicity (Hiramatsu et al., 1990; 
Miller et al., 1997; Bai et al., 1999; Bai et al., 2001) . Since central perfusion of MDMA 
and MDA failed to produce hyperthermia at high ambient temperature, there is the 
possibility that hyperthermia seen following systemic MDMA administration was due to 
the role of other MDMA metabolites further down the metabolism pathways.  
 
Although systemic administration of MDMA is known to cause acute hyperthermia 
(Colado et al., 1995; Malberg and Seiden, 1998; Fonsart et al., 2008)  the mechanism Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  90	  involved is still unclear. One of the suggested mechan isms is disruption of 
thermoregulation due to increase  in 5 -HT levels (Gordon et al., 1991; Blessing et al., 
2003 ). However, administ ration of  100µM MDMA centrally into the rat brain using 
microdialysis resulted in an  increase in hippocampal (Esteban et al., 2001)  and striatal 
(Nixdorf et al., 2001)  5-HT levels 1 -3h following MDMA administration with no 
significant increase  in body temperature. This result is in accordance with the present study 
as we found significant increase in 5 -HT levels without significant increase  in Tc 
following central perfusion of MDMA. In the present study, we also demonstrated 
significant change in Tc from 30 min onwards but only significant increase in 5 -HT 
extracellular levels  at 60 min following systemic administration of MDMA . These results 
suggest no direct functional association between these parameter s in regard to extracellular 
5-HT in str iatum . A study by Mechan et al. (2002)  has also shown that  fluoxetine blocks 5 -
HT extracellular levels  in hippocampus but not hyperthermia, suggesting MDMA -induced 
hyperthermia in rat was not related to extracellular levels  in 5-HT in the brain.  
 
There has been suggestion on the role of DA in mediating hyperther mic effects in rats 
(Green et al., 2003; Docherty and Green, 2010) . MDMA administration in vivo  has been 
shown to produce acute increase in striatal DA concentration. Dopamine D 1 receptor 
antagonist SCH 23390 inhibit ed MDMA -induced hyperthermia in a dose -dependent 
manner which suggest that increase in DA extracellular levels , which acts in this receptor 
leads to hyperthermia (Mechan et al., 2002) . 
 
The other reason for the absence of hyperthermia following central MDMA and MDA 
perfusion into the striatum  could be due to lack of direct involvement of striatum in 
thermoregulation. As explained in the introduction chapter, there were a number of valid 
reasons for selecting the striatum in our study. However, it is also important to repeat these Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  91	  experiments in a region with eviden ce for its role in thermoregulation  such as the preoptic 
area/anterior hypothalamus (PO/AH) (Ishiwata et al., 2002; Nagashima, 2006; Benamar et 
al., 2008) .  
 
In this study, reverse dialysis was done in vitro  to determine the extracellular 
concentrations of MDMA and MDA following central administrat ion of 100µM MDMA 
and 5µM MDA. A p revious study which administered 10mg/kg and 15mg/kg MDMA  i.p 
to rats found concentrations  of 11µM and 20µM MDMA, respectively in the hippocampus 
(Esteban et al., 2001) . In the present study, 10% in vitro  recover y was achieved following  
perfusion of 100µM MDMA and 5µM MDA at 120 and 150 min, respectively and the 
value of 10µM obtained for MDMA is similar to that reported by Esteban et al., (2001).  A 
study in our lab showed that administration of 7.5mg/kg MDMA produces concentration of 
~3200ng/ml (14µM) of MDMA in blood (Jaehne et al., 2010)  and this concentration is 
comparable to previous study which administered 10 and 15mg/kg MDMA and found 
between 11µM and 20µM of MDMA in the hippocampus (Esteban et al., 2001) . A 
previous study that looked at the effects of MDMA and MDA on neurotoxicity 
administered 20µg/µl MDA into the cerebral cortex using microinjection  found no 
serotonin neurotoxicity following MDA administration  (Molliver et al., 1986 ). This is 
among the earlier study to administer MDA directly into the brain. Another study which 
measured brain MDA concentration found peak concentration of MDA in the brain of 
165µM, 45 min following administration of 20mg/kg MDA  (s.c.) (Zaczek et al., 1989)  
Since MDMA and MDA have non -linear pharmacokinetics, it is expected that MDA 
concentration in the brain following systemic administration is not parallel with increase in 
dose and can be quite high.  
 Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  92	  There are a number of limitations to the work that has been conducted in the p resent study. 
It is possible that the lack of pharmacodynamic effects following central perfusion of 
MDMA and MDA was due to the diffusion of the se drugs away from the striatu m. 
However, this problem was add ressed by Esteban et al. (2001)  which  placed a double 
microdialysis probe,  constructed so that shafts and tips were parallel and separated by a 
distance of 1mm. The concentration of MDMA recovered by the second probe reflec t an 
estimated extracellular concentration of MDMA between 10.4 and 19.5 µM which were in 
the range of that found after peripheral administration of 10 and 15mg/kg MDMA, 
respectively.  Accurate probe placement was confirmed by comparing with samples that 
already been established in previous work i n the lab. The present study did  not determine  
the concentrations of MDMA and MDA in the brain throughout the experiment. This 
parameter would help to understand the correlation of MDMA and MDA concentrations in 
the brain at each time p oints with thermal and physiological changes,  and the metabolism 
of the drug.  
 
The present study has demonstrated that systemic administration of MDMA produced 
significant increase in Tc, HR, LMA, and striatal 5 -HT extrace llular levels  as shown by 
previous studies. However, central perfusion of MDMA only produces significant 
elevation of striatal 5 -HT, whereas central perfusion of MDA has no significant effects on 
Tc, HR, LMA and 5 -HT extracellular levels  in the stri atum. It has been shown that acute 
physiological changes following MDMA administration has no direct correlation with 
striatal 5 -HT extracellular levels . These f indings suggest that striatum  plays a minor role in 
mediating hyperthermia and different  mechanisms are involved in mediating MDMA -
induced adverse effects on Tc, HR and LMA. It i s also suggested that MDA does not play 
a major role in MDMA -induced hyperthermia and 5 -HT extracellular levels  in the 
striatum. Future work could explore the effects of these drugs on the PO/AH and nucleus Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  93	  accumbens, which play important roles in thermoregulation and locomotion, respectively, 
and also the role of DA in mediating these effects.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  94	  Chapter 4 General Discussion  
	  
MDMA has been known to cause unpredictable and life -threatning acute toxic effects and 
long-term neurotoxic effects . Research on MDMA has been continuously undertaken  over 
the last few decades  in an attempt  to understand the mechanism of action of this drug. 
Although progress has been made we are still not in a position to predict when adverse 
effects in humans will occur. This lack of understanding is a major hurdle to the 
development and introduction of evidence based preventative and treatment programs.  
 
Whe n MDMA is consumed, it can cause acute increase in Tc, especially when taken a t 
high ambient temperature. This increase in core body temperature  can lead to symptoms 
such as acute renal failure, cardiac arrhythmias, rhabdomyolisis and disseminated 
intravas cular coa gulation that can cause death  (Gowing et al., 2002; Kaye et al., 2009) . 
MDMA can also cause an increase in HR and blood pressure resulting in  clinical adverse 
effects (O'Cain et al., 2000; Badon et al., 2002) . In animal studies, MDMA has been shown 
to cause long term neurochemical chan ges such as decreases in intracellular 5-HT 
concentration s, 5-HT transporters and loss of 5 -HT neurons. These neuronal effects are  
exacerbated by increased in Tc and ambient temperature (Malberg and Seiden, 1998) . High 
ambient temperature can also enhance the rewarding effects of MDMA in rats and human 
(Parrott, 2002; Cornish et al., 2003; Parrott et al., 2006) , which can a ffect MDMA 
consumption and usage. It is difficult to investigate the effects of MDMA alone following 
systemic administration because it is me tabolized to several  active  metabolites , including 
MDA. Some of the conjugated metabolites have been shown to be ne urotoxic (Bai et al., 
1999; Goni -Allo et al., 2008a; Baumann et al., 2009) . The metabolism of MDMA is also 
influence d by Tc and high ambient temperature (Malberg and Seiden, 1998) , which can 
lead to different magnitude of neurotoxicity. In pre -clinical studies, MDA has been shown 
to cause more severe degeneration of serotonin neurons than MDMA. MDMA users are Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  95	  exposed to MDA  in the drug market, where MDA is sold as MDMA or ‘ecstasy ’. They are 
also exposed to MDA as it is a major product of the peripheral metabolism  of MDMA. 
These  situations are concerning and highlight the need  to further understand the potential 
role of MDA, particularly in the occurrence of hyperthermia following MDMA 
administration. Determining the specific brain regions involved in mediating MDMA -
induced hyperthermia and other adverse effects will provide ba sis to develop and improve 
treatment strategies for humans.  
 
A number of methods have been used to assess MDMA effects on thermoregulation in 
animals including rectal measurement, ear temperature measurement, and tail temperature 
measurement (Clement et al., 1989; Gordon et al., 1991; Colado et al., 1995; McGregor et 
al., 2003; Clemens et al., 2007) . Of these methods rectal temperature is considered to be 
most reliable as it is not influenced by operator error or cha nges in regional blood flows. 
However, rectal measurement has been shown to produce stress due to handling of animals 
and repeated insertion of probe into the rectum (Frankel, 1959; Poole and Stephenson, 
1977; Clement e t al., 1989; Dilsaver et al., 1990 ), which can possibly influence  the actual 
effects of MDMA on body tempe rature. Recent development of telemetry method s in 
small animals  may provide  a better option to assess MDMA effects on Tc as this method 
allows co ntinuous measurement of Tc, and other parameters including HR, blood pressure 
and LMA (Gallaher et al., 1985; Clement et al., 1989; Dilsaver et al., 1990; Brockway et 
al., 1991; Guiol et al., 1992; van den Buuse, 1994; Huetteman and Bogie, 2009 ). 
Previously, there has been no comparison of rectal measurement and telemetry to assess 
MDMA effects. In the first study  described in this thesis , the usage of rectal probe and 
telemetry to assess MDMA effects at high ambient temperature on Tc were compared. Our 
results have indicated that telemetry provides a better tool to assess MDMA effects on Tc 
as it prevented potentiation of MDMA effects o n Tc , which occurred with rectal Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  96	  measurements . The second study was undertaken to d etermine the validity of  combined 
telemetry and microdialysis use to assess the effects of systemic MDMA administration, 
and central MDMA and MDA perfusion into the striatum. Previously, animals were 
sacrificed at different time points to assess acute neur ochemical changes following drug 
administration to relate the changes in physiological and thermoregulatory parameters to 
neurochemical changes in the brain. At the time of start ing work for this thesis, only two  
studies  had used the combined techniques to  relate the physiological and neurochemical 
changes (Benamar et al., 2008; Rodsiri et al., 2011 ), in which one study used thermosensor 
telemetry.  Benamar et al. (2008) measured the effects of MDMA on Tc and the 
extracellular levels  of dopamine  in the PO/AH , whereas Rodsiri et al. (2011) measured the 
concomitant effects of MDMA binge dosing on hippocampal extracellular 5 -HT, 
locomotion and Tc.  The latter  demonstrated that  acute physiological changes followi ng 
MDMA administration have  no direct correlation wi th striatal 5 -HT extracellular levels . 
However both of these studies did not look at th e effects of MDMA on heart rate or  the 
effects of MDA . Furthermore,  the experiment s were conducted at normal ambient 
temperature which did not mimic the raves and  clubs condition where ‘Ecstasy’ is usually 
consumed. The main aim of the second  study was to assess MDMA physiological and 
neurochemical effects, and the role of MDA in MDMA -induced hyperthermia at high 
ambient temperature using combined telemetry and mic rodialysis techniques.  
 
This research comprised  two parts. The first part investigated the influence of 
methodological approaches used to measure MDMA -induced increase in body 
temperature. The use of rectal probe caused potentiation of MDMA effects o n body  
temperature compared to the use of telemetry to measure Tc and has also resulted in a 
lower survival rate. The use of telemetry resulted in a higher behavioural score in 
comparison to the use of rectal probe.  Our results have indicated that the use of rectal Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  97	  probe has a potential to influence body temperature measurements and ths could be 
attributed to stress (Matthew, 1997; Clark et al., 2003; Veening et al., 2004) . 
 
The second part of this thesis looked at the use of combined telemetry and microdialysis 
techniques to investigate the effects of systemic MDMA administration and central 
MDMA and MDA  perfusion into the striatum, on the acut e pharmacodynamic effects and 
striatal 5 -HT extracellular levels . Syste mic MDMA administration produced  significant 
increase in Tc, HR, LMA, and striatal 5 -HT extracellular levels  and these results were 
comparable to previous studies which looked at the effects of systemic administration of 
MDMA in rats (Dafters, 1994; Green et al., 2003; Bexis and Docherty, 2006) . We have 
demonstrated that 10mg/kg MDMA i.p. produces an increase in Tc of around 3°C, when 
given to SD rats at high ambien t temperature of 29°C. This is comparable to the findings 
demonstrated in previous studies in which MDMA was given at similar doses and ambient 
temperatures (Malberg and Seiden, 1998; Mechan et al., 2002) . Following systemic 
MDMA administrat ion, MDMA -induced 5 -HT release  w as significantly higher than 
control at 60 min post -treatment  but MDMA -induced hyperthermia wa s signif icantly 
higher than  control at earlier time points preceding the increase in brain 5 -HT. These 
results suggested that there was no direct association between  M D M A -induced 
hyperthermia and release  of 5 -HT in the striatum. We have also shown that  systemic 
administration of MDMA produces an increase in HR at high Ta.  Changes in HR after 
MDMA administration may be a result of direct sympathomimetic effects on the control of 
the cardiovascular system either centrally or peripherally or by an indirect effect in 
response to the disruption of the central mechanisms of thermoregulation  (Bexis and 
Docherty, 2005; Bexis and Docherty, 2006) .  
 Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  98	  Central perfusion of M DMA and MDA did not produce any change in Tc, HR and LMA 
but central perfusion of MDMA produces significant increase  in striatal 5 -HT extracellular 
levels . The results obtained for MDMA are  consistent with previous studies which 
administered MDMA ce ntrally to the brain and found no significant change in Tc despite a  
significant increase in 5 -HT extracellular levels  in the striatum and the hippocampus  
(Esteban et al., 2001; Nixdorf et al., 2001) . However,  studies on central MDA effects are  
scarce (Molliver et al., 1986; McCann and Ricaurte, 1991b; Elayan et al., 1992)  and no 
previous studies have looked at the acute effects following central MDA perfusion.  Central 
MDMA perfusion produced  significant 5 -HT extracellular levels  at a later stage (150 min) 
in comparison to systemic MDMA administration (60 min). This is proabably due to the 
time it takes for central MDMA perfus ion to reach the concentration of ~10µM, which is  
similar to  the concentrat ion found in rat brain following systemic 10 mg/kg MDMA 
administration . This result is supported by the  microdialysis probe in vitro recovery data  
indicating that it takes up to 150 min to achieve ~10 µM concentration  (Figure 3.1) .  
 
Striatal administratio n of both MDMA and MDA did not produce significant change in Tc, 
HR, and LMA. The lack of effect on LMA is suprising  considering the striatum’s 
important role in locomotion. Our results suggest  that MDMA distribution to several brain 
regions is essential to induce significant increase in locomotion hyperactivity  instead of 
confined perfusion within the striatum . Previous studies have also suggested the role of 
DA in mediating MDMA -induced locomo tion effects  (Green et al., 2003; Baumann et al., 
2008) .  
 
There were some limitations to the work that has been conducted in this research. In the 
second  study, it was shown that MDMA -induced striatal 5 -HT extracellular levels  has no 
direct association with MDMA -induced increase in body temperature. However, in this Intan	  Omar,	   Master	  thesis	  2015 	   	   	  99	  study the con centration of DA was not  analyzed.  Previous work has demonstrated that the 
D1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390 can significantly attenua te MDMA -induced 
hyperthermia suggesting that  D A  extracellular levels  is associated with chan ges in body 
temperature  (Mechan et al., 2002) . It was also shown that MDMA -induced ambulation and 
stereotypy are correlated with increases in dialysate DA  concentrations  in nucleus 
accumbens and striatum (Baumann et al., 2008) . Since central perfusion of MDMA and 
MDA into the striatum failed to reproduce hyperthermia  that has been demonstrated  
following systemic administration, it is important t o investigate central perfusion of both 
drugs into other brain regions, especially the PO/AH which has been shown to play a major 
role in thermoregulation (Boulant and Dean, 1986; Hasegawa et al., 2005; Benamar et al., 
2008 ). In addition, although the doses used in the present study were comparable to those 
consumed by humans, there were differences in pharmacokinetics between rats and 
humans which limits direct extrapolation of the results from  animal studies into hu mans . 
Future studies should also look at long-term effects in relation  to thermoregulation  
following  MDMA and MDA perfusion into different  brain  regions . In conclusion, this 
research has highlighted some important technical issues in the methodologies appl ied to 
investigate  MDMA -induced physiological and neurochemical effects in animal models.  It 
also has highlighted problems in assuming drug effects on neurotransmitter extracellular 
levels  is homogeneous throughout the brain and reinforces the need for regional studies 
within the brain.  
 
The complex pharmacology of MDMA is still setting challenges to researchers . The issues 
identified in this thesis will contribute to our understanding  of MDMA behavioural and 
neurochemical effects and potentially  leading to improved risk reduction and treatment of 
MDMA adverse effects in humans.
