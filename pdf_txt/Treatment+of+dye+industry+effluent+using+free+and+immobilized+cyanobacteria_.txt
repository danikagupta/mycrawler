Abstract : 
An attempt has been made to study the feasibility of pharmaceutical wastewaters 
(laboratories waste (WI) and production waste (WII)) treatment using free and 
immobilized cyano bacterium Phormidium fragile. After preliminary test with different 
concentrations, WI showed high toxicity, only 0.5% conc. was effective while WII was 
used at high conc. of 40% after 10 days incubation (from growth curve experiment) in 
optimum growth con ditions. Role of Phormidium cells in bioremediation of 
pharmaceutical wastewaters was effective whereas maximum percentage removal in tested 
parameters were 51.56% and 58.89% for ammonia, 66.67% and 61.23% for phosphorus, 
51.74% and 54.55% for COD and 37.0 5% and 59.85% for BOD in WI and WII 
respectively with respect to treatments without microalgae. N -starvation for 36 hours prior 
to cultivation caused increase in percentage removal of ammonia, phosphorus and COD 
with increase in algal dose than unstarved c ells, 100%, 100% and 72.56% for WI and 
87.28%, 100% and 71.98% for WII, respectively with 40 ml algal dose. It was found that 
2500 lux and 25 ºC were the best for nutrients removal. Chlorophyll a, dry weight, protein 
and total carbohydrate contents were al so estimated. During this study, pH levels 
increased and remained in the range 7.3 to 9.1. Significant removal of ammonia, 
phosphorus and COD were observed in algal alginate beads treatments than blank beads. 
Starvation before immobilization recorded the h ighest removal percentage when compared 
to unstarved beads or free cells in both wastes types and their mixture (1:1). When starved 
and unstarved Phormidium beads were incubated in WI, WII and a mixture of both in a 
semi -continuous system for five consecut ive cycles (10 days each), there was increase in 
nutrients percentage removal up to the third cycle. Microalga in the beads survived long 
enough which gives a promise to upgrading immobilization technique for wastewater 
treatment with low cost.

 Introduction  
 
The pharmaceutical industry is one of the most important for modern 
civilization. Increasing number of pharmaceutical ind ustries leads to hazardous 
impact on water quality and thus affects the surrounding environment and human 
health. Thus, the pharmaceutical industry has become one of the major causes of 
concern. The day by day increased level of water pollution highlights the need for 
time to time assessment/characterization of pharmaceutical industrial wastewater 
(Rana et al. , 2014) . Many pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) 
have been designed to stay active for long periods of time to fulfill their 
therapeutic function; thus, they can persist in the environment, remaining active 
and affecting aquatic life (Ricart et al., 2010; Kvarnryd et al., 2011) .  
 
 In fact, the pharmaceutical industry is characterized by a diversity of 
products, processes, plant sizes, as well as wastewater quantity and quality.  
Hence, it is almost impossible to describe a “typical” pharmaceutical  effluent 
because of such diversity, wastewater treatment and disposal problems have also 
increased as a result  (Dixit and Parmar, 2013) . Though the volume of untreated 
or incompletely treated pharmaceutical industry wastewater is small, it contains a 
high level of pollutants because of the presence of nonbiodegradable organic 
matter and other pollutants (Vuppala et al ., 2012;  Ramola and Singh, 2013).  
Untreated pharmaceutical wastewater discharge into the natural environment 
causes health hazards to existin g flora and fauna and therefore, treatment of the 
effluents is necessary to bring down the concentration of toxic substances to 
desired limits, before they are finally discharged into the natural systems 
(UNESCO, 2005).  In order to design an appropriate tr eatment system the 
characteristics of the generated wastewater need to be followed and analyzed.  
Nowadays, pharmaceutical companies employ a variety of treatment methods, 
which includes primary: chemical and physicochemical, secondary: biological 
process a nd tertiary: advanced oxidation processes which utilize costly chemicals 
and treatment units, which are difficult to manage at the industrial unit level 
(Amin et al., 2013; Vanerkar et al., 2013).  
 Pharmaceutical wastewater treatment using free and immobilized Cyanobacteria

 Phycoremediation is a novel, low cost and an effective te chnique that uses 
algae to clean up wastewater offering very simple and economical method as 
compared to the other conventional treatments (Elumalai et al. , 2013) . Also 
microalgae have an effective role in the uptake of the pollutants to use inorganic 
nitrogen and phosphorus for their growth as well as their ability to produce 
valuable biomass that can be used in different industrial applications (Tam and 
Wong, 1995) . Successful treatment of wastewater with microalgae requires 
understanding of the factors t hat affect growth such as physical, chemical and 
biological factors (Larsdotter, 2006) . The major problem in utilization of 
microa lgae in any industrial or waste water treatment is harvesting of the biomass. 
This is solved by the strategy of immobilization.  This precludes the use of 
supporting material obtained either naturally including agar, alginate and 
carrageenan or synthetics such as polyacrylamide and polyurethane 
(Vijayakumar, 2012) . The aim of the present study is treatment of the 
pharmaceutical was tewaters with free and immobilized cyanobacteria under 
different conditions in a trial for bioremediation and also testing the growth and 
synthesis of some metabolites of the used cyanobacterium were undertaken for 
further applications.  
 
 
Materials and Methods  
 
Organism and growth conditions:  
The filamentous fresh water cyanobacterium Phormidium fragile was 
selected for the current study, it was kindly supplied from the culture collection of 
Botany and Microbiology Department, Faculty of Science, Cairo U niversity, 
Egypt. It was routinely grown in BG 11 medium (Rippka et al.,  1979) at 
continuous illumination with light intensity of 48.75 µEm-2s-1 (2500 lux) at 25 ± 2 
ºC. The start inoculum was adjusted to be approximately 1.297 µg ml-1 
chlorophyll a. Optimum growth period was found to be 10 days (cells in the 
exponential phase) as determined from growth curve experiment.

 Pharmaceutical wastewater:   
The pharmaceutical wastewaters used in this study were obtained from a 
pharmaceutical c ompany in 6th of October city, 1st industrial zone on February 
2017 in one liter capacity bottles. They are two types: Wastewater I (Laboratories 
waste WI), it was collected from chemical laboratories safety cans, it includes 
inorganic acids and bases, org anic solvents, metals, unused chemicals and 
chemical reactions products and Wastewater II (Production Waste WII), it was 
collected by mixing equal volumes from the washing rinse of different production 
departments, it include parenteral, solids (Tablets an d Capsules), semisolids, 
(cream, ointment, gel and suppository), syrups, antibiotics, instant and powders. 
Both waste types were separately collected and analyzed pre and post experiments 
within few hours from collection according to standard procedures of  APHA 
(2012) . Wastes were immediately preserved in refrigerator at 4 ºC. Thereafter the 
primary treated wastes were kept in a deep freezer at - 20 ºC until used (Fedorova 
et al.,  2014) .  
 
Methods of experimentation:  
After preliminary experiments serial dil utions of wastewaters were 
prepared by mixing primary treated wastewater and distilled water to obtain 
concentrations of 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 3% and 4% (V/V) for wastewater I and 10%, 
20%, 40%, 60% and 80% (V/V) for wastewater II. Triplicate flasks from all 
treatments each containing 300 ml primary treated wastes in addition to control 
(BG11) were inoculated with 20 ml of Phormidium  fragile  culture. After 10 days 
incubation in optimum conditions cyanobacterial cells were harvested and growth 
parameters were measur ed in terms of chlorophyll a (Sartory and Grobbelaar, 
1984) , dry weight (APHA, 2012) , total carbohydrates (Dubois et al. , 1956)  and 
protein (Lowry et al. , 1951) , in addition to BOD, COD (APHA, 2012) , ammonia 
(Chaney and Marbach, 1962)  and phosphorus using Fiske -Subbarow method  
(Clark and Switzer, 1977)  of treated wastewaters were also analyzed. Next, the 
most efficient conc. selected from each waste but with no cyanobacterial inocula 
was prepared and used as negative control. The chose n wastes concentrations 
were used for the next experiment in which a series of cyanobacterial suspension 
inocula (5, 10, 20, 30, 40 ml) were inoculated in conical flasks containing 300 ml 
waste each. A parallel group of flasks in which Phormidium fragile  was Pharmaceutical wastewater treatment using free and immobilized Cyanobacteria

 previously nitrogen starved for 36 hours before inoculation. All treatments of 
starved and unstarved microalgal cells were incubated for 10 days after which 
growth parameters and wastewaters were analyzed. Two ecological factors, light 
intensity (2500, 8000 and 12000 lux) and temperature (15±2 ºC, 25±2 ºC and 40±2 
ºC) were tested to study their role in pharmaceutical wastewater bioremediation by 
Phormidium fragile . 
  
For the formation of the immobilized cyanobacterial beads, the same 
inoculum of Phormidium was washed twice with double distilled water and initial 
chlorophyll a was determined.  The required quantity was added as a suspension to 
the sodium alginate solution (5% W/V) in distilled water after sterilization and 
cooling under aseptic cond itions, alginate beads were formed by using a peristaltic 
pump to obtain (bead average diameter ≈ 0.5 cm), by drop wise into calcium 
chloride CaCl 2 0.2 M solution using magnetic stirrer during the preparation for 
two hours to maintain the shape stability (Rai and Mallick, 1992) . The same 
steps were repeated on the nitrogen starved alga and empty alginate beads 
(without microalga). Fifty beads were added in each flask which containing 200 
ml waste. The same steps were repeated on a mixture (1:1) from waste I  (0.5%) 
and waste II (40%) freshly prepared for immobilized Phormidium  cells either 
starved or unstarved, in addition to blank beads. At the end of incubation period 
microalgal beads were separated from the wastewater by filtration and the wastes 
were anal yzed for ammonia, phosphorus and COD. Phormidium  alginate beads 
used in the previous experiment were used in five consecutive cycles (10 days 
each) with fresh waste which was analyzed after each cycle in a semi -continuous 
mode in a trial to test the long t erm effect of microalgal beads in wastewater 
treatment.  
 
Statistical analysis:  
The means and standard deviation values of the triplicates for each 
treatment were calculated. The data were analyzed statistically on the basis of 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) . All statistical analyses were carried out using 
SPSS program (IBM, version 23).

Results  and Discussion  
 
Some raw and treated pharmaceutical wastewaters (Laboratories WI and 
Production WII) characteristics were analyzed before the beginning of the 
experiments (Table 1). pH value of WI was 10.3 and became 7 after 
neutralization. Both wastes were filtered, tota l, suspended and dissolved solids 
were much lower in treated (filtered) wastes, all were higher in WII than in WI. 
Shabana (1994)  mentioned that filtration helps in removal of solid particles 
which leads to decrease of some pollutants by adsorption on its surface. Decrease 
in ammonia, phosphorus, anions and cations, was observed in treated wastes. An 
observed decrease in COD and BOD by filtration with higher values in WII than 
WI, yet both values are still exceeding the official limits for wastewater dispos al. 
At high pH (8.5 or above) especially in presence of calcium ion, some of the 
phosphorus will be precipitated in the form of orthophosphate which is the case 
for WII in this study (Jimenez - Perez et al., 2004) .    
The effect of different concentrations of pharmaceutical wastewaters WI 
and WII after preliminary experiment on the synthesis of pigment and metabolites 
in terms of chlorophyll a, dry weight, protein and total carbohydrates is shown in 
(Table 2). Chlorophyll a content for Phormidium fragile culture decreased 
significantly (P˂0.05) with increase in waste I concentration to reach minimum 
value (1316.00 µgL-1) at 4% conc. The highest chlorophyll a value was recorded 
at 0.5% conc. (2026.33 µgL-1). 
In waste II treatments there was a significant in crease in chlorophyll a 
content up to 40% conc. (2203.67 µgL-1). Laboratories wastewater seems more 
toxic than production waste. In this connection, (Li et al., 1991)  reported that the 
higher the content of algal chlorophyll a in the water, the more effect ive the 
removal of nitrogen and phosphorus from the water. Since the highest chlorophyll 
a content was observed in 0.5% for waste I and 40% conc. for waste II but all are 
still less than control value, these concentrations were selected to be used in all 
the following experiments in this investigation. Dry weight have similar trend of 
chlorophyll a for both types of wastes.

In waste I treatments the highest protein value (Table 2) was recorded at 
0.5% conc. (25.97 mgL-1). In waste II, the production of protein was favored by 
increase in waste concentration up to 40%, it recorded (22.74 mgL-1) but all 
values are still more than control value. Total carbohydrates accumulation by 
Phormidium fragile culture was decreased by increase in WI concentrations till it 
reached (48.89 mgL-1) at 4% conc. In WII treatments, there was an increase in Shabana  et al.

From the above mentioned experiment, the selected concentrations (0.5% 
for waste I and 40% for waste II) were incubated in optimum growth conditions 
with and without inoculation with Phormidium fragile . The microalgal efficiency 
for removing ammonia, phosp horus and reduction of COD and BOD from 
pharmaceutical wastewaters at certain concentrations was presented in (Table 3). 
The results demonstrated that removal percentage of ammonia, phosphorus, COD 
and BOD were higher after microalgal treatment than treatm ents without 
microalga indicating effective role of Phormidium fragile  in removal process. In 
the above parameters except phosphorus, percentage removal was higher in 
Pharmaceutical production waste (WII) than laboratories waste (WI). Whereas 
ammonia percentage removal by Phormidium  in WI was 51.56% and 58.89%  in 
WII while i t was 22.67% for WI 0.5% and 25.02% for WII 40% in treatment 
without algae which is in agreement with Lau et al.  (1995) , they found that 
maximum ammonia removal percentage in the control (without algae) was less 
than 20%. Microalgae mainly use inorganic ni trogen as a nutrient source for their 
cell synthesis and ammonia is the first preferable form of inorganic nitrogen for 
microalgae. Tam and Wong (2000)  found that the reductions in wastewater 
NH 4+-N concentrations in all algal bioreactors were significantl y better than those 
without algae, suggesting that uptake of ammonium and assimilation into algal 
biomass are essential processes.  Dubey et al.  (2011)  investigated the potential 
degradation of industrial effluents by environmental species of cyanobacteria 
isolated from the pharmaceutical industries. Results indicated the potential of 
natural resources as efficient agents for pollution control.  
 
In the results demonstrated in (Table 3), phosphorus was efficiently 
reduced in both wastes WI 0.5% conc. and WII 40% conc. by 66.67 % and 
61.23% respectively. Also COD was reduced from 922 to 445 mgL-1 and from 
5460 to 2481.33 mgL-1 for laboratories WI an d production WII wastes 
respectively. Also BOD was reduced from 224 to 141 mgL-1 and from 680 to 273 
mgL-1 for WI and WII with algae respectively, comparing with treatment without 
algae, this indicates the role of microalgal cells in the treatment. In prev ious study 
reported by Kshirsagar (2010) , COD of herbal and bulk drug pharmaceutical 
wastewaters was reduced from 13,090 to 3,927 mgL-1 and from 34,452 to 13,333 Shabana  et al.

 mgL-1 respectively whereas BOD of herbal and bulk drug pharmaceutical 
wastewater was reduced f rom 7,420 to 2,003 mgL-1 and from 15,840 to 5,608 
mgL-1 respectively.

Nutrient starvation is a stressful condition for algae that changes 
biochemical compounds of biomass (Malakootian et al., 2015) . The effect of N -
starvation for Phormidium  cells and a series of cyanobacterial suspension inocula 
on nutrient removal from WI and WII was investigated. The data generated in the 
present study (Fig.1) revealed that removal efficiency of ammonia from  WI 0.5% Pharmaceutical wastewater treatment using free and immobilized Cyanobacteria

 conc. by Phormidium fragile  ranged from  16 - 100% for unstarved cells, while it 
was 28.44 - 100% for starved cells and for WII 40% conc. ranged from 48.86 -
84.92% for unstarved cells, while it was 51.05 – 87.28% for starved cells. 
Increase in algal dose caused significant decrease in ammonia con tent from both 
pharmaceutical wastewaters in both unstarved and starved cell cultures and 
reached maximum removal percentage at 40 ml algal dose, it was 100% in WI and 
87.28% in WII starved cells.  Lee et al.  (2016)  reported that the increased algal 
biomass  was accompanied by ammonia decrease during the first 5 days which 
indicates that algae take up ammonia for biomass production and as an energy 
source leading to increased nitrogen removal .  
 
In the current study, Phosphorus conc. in the wastewaters exhibited high 
decrease with increase in algal inoculum of both unstarved, starved cultures 
(Fig.1). Phosphorus disappeared completely at higher algal doses (30 ml and 40 
ml) recording 100% percenta ge removal in both unstarved and starved cells. 
These data are in agreement with (Tam and Wong, 1989) , who reported an 
increase in phosphorus removal with increasing inoculum dose of algal cells. 
Amiri and Ahmadi (2019)  reported that phosphate removal duri ng 
phycoremediation is due to the utilization of phosphorus for algal growth. The 
phosphorus, which is used in the algal cells mainly for the production of 
phosphorous -contain ing compounds such as adenosine  triphosphate (ATP) and 
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate -oxidase (NADPH). Rao et al.  
(2011)  suggested that the chemical stripping of phosphorus may be regarded as an 
advantageous side -effect of the algal growth, with enhanced phosphorus removal 
as a result.  
 
COD determined at the end of incubation period generally exhibited 
reduction with increase in algal inoculums (Fig.1). Percentage reduction of COD 
was 72.56% and 71.98% at higher starved algal dose for WI and WII respectively 
while it recorded  percentage reduction 65.62% of initial conc. for unstarved algal 
cells for WI and 68.58% for WII. In the contrary, Lau et al.  (1995)  reported that 
Chlorella vulgaris  with four initial inoculum sizes when applied to primary 
treated sewage, there were no si gnificant differences between the four algal 
cultures in terms of COD removal.  Shabana  et al.

The data presented  in (Fig. 2) revealed that chlorophyll a content and dry 
weight values of  Phormidium  cells in both wastes (WI 0.5% conc. and WII 40% 
conc.) increased significantly by increasing  the algal dose of both unstarved and 
starved Phormidium  cells showing higher contents of chlorophyll a in the starved 
treatments than the unstarved. Chlorophyll a content was (3756.67 µgL-1) and

 (3690.00 µgL-1) at 40 ml algal dose in starved Phormidium cells for WI 0.5% and 
WII 40% respectively. The same trend was demonstrated for dry weight data 
which was highly increased with increasing algal inoculum to reach highest 
values (546.67 mgL-1 and 480.00 mgL-1) at 40 ml unstarved and starved 
Phormidium cells f or WI 0.5% while recorded (626.67 mgL-1 and 533.33 mgL-1) 
at 40 ml unstarved and starved algal cells for WII 40% at the end of incubation 
period.  The data presented in (Fig.2) also revealed that protein production by 
Phormidium cultures was favored with in crease in algal dose to reach the highest 
yields (45.88 mgL-1 and 49.81 mgL-1) at 40 ml unstarved and starved cells  for WI 
0.5% while reached (29.79 mgL-1 and 34.80 mgL-1) at 40 ml unstarved and 
starved for WII 40%.  In addition, increase in the protein co ntent in starved algal 
cells was more than unstarved for both waste types. The same trend was 
demonstrated for accumulation of total carbohydrates, since the highest values 
(76.32mgL-1 and 93.52 mgL-1)  were recorded at 40 ml unstarved and starved 
Phormidi um cells for WI 0.5% while recorded (127.57 mgL-1 and 156.77 mgL-1) 
at 40 ml unstarved and starved for WII 40%. Nitrogen starvation was also 
employed to trigger the accumulation of lipid and carbohydrate (Ho et al. , 2012) . 
It is clear that in contrary to protein the production of total carbohydrates by 
Phormidium cultures in waste II at moderate and higher doses far exceeded that 
accumulated in waste I cultures.  
Mandal and Mallick (2009)  demonstrated that cultivation under n itrogen 
deficient conditions leads to a sharp increase in the lipid or carbohydrate content, 
because the condition of nitrogen - depletion probably transforms protein or 
peptides to lipids or carbohydrates. Therefore, the condition of nitrogen starvation 
causes an enhancement of energy -rich products, such as lipids and carbohydrates. 
Quantities of the available nitrogen in the culture directly alter cell growth. 
Nitrogen limitation in the microalgae culture can reduce growth and biomass 
productivity although  they increase production of carbohydrates and lipids 
(Daliry  et al.,  2017) .Worthy to be noted that, in the present study the protein and 
total carbohydrate contents of Phormidium  cells in certain concentrations of both 
wastes tended to increase progressively by intensifying the algal dose with higher 
value in the starved than the unstarved algal dose. Salama and Shabana (1989)  
found that nitrogen starvation of Phormidium fragile for 36 - 44 hrs leads to 
elevation in the total carbohydrate and protein accumulation by the organism.  Shabana  et al.

 An excessive cell density could limit the light penetration into the water 
column and thus reduce the growth, particularly in scarcely mixed cultures 
(Campos -Rudin and Silva -Benavides, 2018) . 
 
Apart from photosynthetic and chemosynthetic assimilation by microalgae, N 
and P removal from wastewaters are also affected by abiotic factors significantly. 
Therefore, the N and P removal in wastewater -based algae cultivation system 
were attributed to ass imilation by microalgae as well as volatilization and 
precipitation caused by abiotic factors (Zhou, 2014). Culture growth depends on 
different fac tors such as light intensity, pH, nutrients, carbon dioxide, mixing, and 
temperature. In wastewater, growth depends in part by the active nutrient uptake 
of the photosynthetic cells and their transformation into biomass (Voltolina et al., 
2005) . Regarding light intensity (Fig.3), it is relevant to notice that 2500 lux was 
the optimum light intensity for ammonia and phosphorus removal from both 
pharmaceutical wastewaters by Phormidium cultures 52.89% and 66.67% in WI 
and 59.14% and 62.32% in WII. Microalgae need light as an energy source to 
convert the absorbed water and CO 2 into biomass through photosynthesis 
(Ozkurt, 2009) . Nutrient removal can also be further increased by NH 3 stripping 
or P precipitation due to the rise in the pH associated with photosynthesis 
(Larsdotter, 2006) . Also the data in (Fig.3) revealed that the highest COD 
percentage reduction was in 2500 lux for WI 0.5% conc. and WII 40% conc. 
cultures (54.23% and 54.92%) respectively. Ho et al.  (2012) observed in a study, 
the dependence of the specific growth rate of  Scenedesmus  obliquus  on light 
intensity under continuous illumination. It was clearly seen that the specific 
growth rate increased dramatically with rising light intensity and then it gradually 
leveled off as the light intensity continued to rise. Suggest ing that excessive 
illumination would inhibit the biomass production and CO 2 fixation ability, which 
is commonly recognized as the photo -inhibition effect . 
Temperature is another important factor in the growth of  microalgae and 
directly influences the biochemical processes , including photosynthesis, in the 
algal cell factory . Each species has its own optimal growth temperature . 
Increasing temperature to the optimum range exponentially increases algal 
growth, but an increase or decrease in the temperatur e beyond the optimal point 
retards or even stops algae growth and activity (Bechet et al.,  2017) .  Shabana  et al.

 In the current study, maximum ammonia and phosphorus removal were 
recorded at 25 ± 2ºC for both wastes where it was 53.78% and 66.67%  in WI and 
59.65% and 64.13% in WII. Azeez (2010)  reported that the highest removal of 
nitrogen and phosphorus is achieved at temperature 30°C and they were 92%, 
89% respectively. The data recorded in (Fig.3) showed that maximum  percentage 
reduction of COD  was at 25 ± 2ºC (53.15% and 55.01% of initial) w as recorded at 
such degree for WI and WII respectively. On the other hand minimum percentage 
removal of COD was attained at 40 ºC (47.47% and 49.48%)  for WI and WII 
which is in agreement with (Azeez, 2010) , who found that at temperature 30°C 
there is a dec rease in COD with a removal efficiency 88%. While at temperature 
higher than 30°C the removal efficiency of COD decreases because the activity of 
microorganism becomes lower after this temperature which means that ability to 
remove pollutants decreases. Ho wever, in optimum temperature algal growth 
would not be affected by high light intensities (Borowitzka, 1998) . Microalgae 
can tolerate the temperature range of 16 –27 ºC and the temperature lower than 16 
ºC slow down the growth whereas higher than 35 ºC is harmful for the number of 
species (Butterwick  et al. 2005) . 
 
The use of free cells is rather rare in comparison to immobilized cells, since 
immobilization of cells offers various advantages and the process is cost effective 
(Vijayakumar, 2012) . The immobil ized cells have many advantages in the 
bioremediation pollutants in wastewaters: nontoxic, transparent for light, stable in 
growth medium, a high population density can be entrapped in a small volume, it 
provides microorganisms protection against toxicity of the pollutants in 
wastewater, the minimization of inhibition and toxicity to microbial cells by 
diffusional constrains as well as avoiding cell harvesting problems. The 
immobilized cells can be reused for successive applications and this reduce the 
costs because it can remain viable for long time, it can be stored for long periods 
without loss of their activities for bioremediation (Mallick, 2002; Quek e t al., 
2006; Bikram et al., 2014). Protection against toxicity in immobilized cells is 
reported in dif ferent works. Immobilized cells are characterized by its stability 
because the cells are entrapped in the matrix and are protected from toxic 
compounds in wastewater; therefore, they have a higher efficiency for the removal 
of nutrients (Cassidy et al., 1996; EL-Sheekh et al., 2016) , dye (Revathi et al.,  
2017) , and heavy metals (EL-Sheekh and Mahmoud 2017)  than free cells.  Shabana  et al.  
Egyptian J. of Phycol. Vol. 20, 2019   - 140 - 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Despite these advantages, alginate beads have some disadvantages such as their 
low mechanical stability for long term use in bioreacto r; more over calcium 
alginate gels are disrupted by phosphate ions (Boominathan, 2005 ; 
Vijayakumar and Manoharan, 2012) . 
 
In the present study, initial ammonia contents were (2.25, 11.87 and 7.33 
mgL-1) in waste I, waste II and their mixture. Ammonia content was significantly 
decreased in all treatments (Table 4) either in free or immobilized algal cells when 
incubated in waste I and waste II giving removal percentage (53.33% and 
59.73%) in free cells. Removal percentage in all treatments increased (72.44%, 
89.22% and 69.03%) for WI, WII and their mixture (1:1) which means that 
Phormidium in alginate beads was more efficient than free algal cells in the 
ammonia removal process. Higher nutrient removal ef ficiency has been recorded 
in the immobilized algal biomass than the freely suspended cells of the same algal 
species (De la Noüe and Proul x, 1988; Abdel  Hameed, 2002) . Moreover 
nitrogen starvation of algal cells before immobilization recorded the highest value 
of ammonia removal (80%, 91.15% and 79.54%) for WI, WII and their mixture, 
respectively. The success in employing immobilized microalgae for wastewater 
treatment d epends upon many factors, including algal species, immobilization 
matrix, cell and bead concentration, bead morphology, etc. (Tam and Wong, 
2000) . This is in agreement with (Abdel Hameed, 2007) , who reported that C. 
vulgaris immobilized in alginate beads w ere more effective in removing N and P 
from wastewater than blank alginate beads. (Table 4) showed that most efficient 
ammonia removal occurs in the treatments with starved immobilized Phormidium 
cultures for WI, WII and their mixture after 10 days incubat ion period.  
 
Regarding to Phosphorus content, it was decreased in all treatments. Data 
in (Table 4) showed that i mmobilized Phormidium was more efficient than free 
algal cells in the phosphorus removal since percentage removal reached 100%, 
73.91% and 63. 33% for WI, WII and their mixture where as it was 66.67% and 
63.41% for WI and WII free cultures.  Starvation of algal cells before 
immobilization recorded the highest values of phosphorus removal (100.00%, 
88.04% and 84.00% ).

 Tam and Wong  (2000)  reported 78 % ammonium and 94 % phosphate 
removal efficiencies with immobilized C. vulgaris , entrapped in calcium alginate 
beads, compared to the 40 % ammonium and 59 % phosphate removal with free 
cells. Lau et al.  (1997)  also observed significantly highe r ammonium (95%) and 
phosphate (99%) removal efficiencies for C. vulgaris  cells immobilized in 
alginate beads relative to their free counterparts.  
Initial COD content in WI (922.00 mgL-1), in WII (5460 .00 mgL-1) and 
their mixture ( 3191.67  mgL-1) decreased recording higher percentage reduction in 
Phormidium  alginate beads treatments. Starvation before immobilization 
increased reduction percentage of COD in all wastes tested recording (60.48%, 
61.31% and 64.63%) for WI, WII and their mixture, resp ectively. The lowest 
reduction percentages for ammonia, phosphorus and COD were observed in blank 
beads for all waste treatments indicating the role of algal cells in the process of 
bioremediation. The low efficiency of removal of COD in the blank beads fl at-
photobioreactor was due to the presence of a carboxyl functional group which 
binds to the organic material only (Singh et al ., 2012) . Lau et al.  (1997)  
supported the idea that simple inorganic ions such as nitrate, ammonium and 
phosphate would be as fre ely available to immobilized algae as to their free 
counterparts, because nutrients must diffuse through the alginate pores to reach 
the algal cells.  The higher phosphorus removal in immobilized cells may be 
directly related to the initial concentration of  cells per ml of culture medium. The 
lower cells density may have caused a greater light diffusion and, thus, lower self -
shading effect within cells. This could have allowed for greater cellular activity 
and consequently reach larger nutrients removal (Ruiz -Marin  et al. , 2010) . It is 
worthy to mention that free algal cells were disintegrated in the mixture treatment 
giving no growth which means inhibitory effect of it when in a direct contact with 
the microalgal cells. The immobilization on alginates pr otects microorganisms 
from toxic substances, pH, and temperature extremes (Lessel, 1994 ). It increases 
the rate of biodegradation of pollutants through increasing cell loading and this 
also improve the catalytic stability as well as the tolerance against t oxic pollutants 
(Wang et al.,  2007) . From the present data it is clear that immobilized 
Phormidium was more efficient than free algal cells in the removal process where 
as nitrogen starvation before immobilization increased removal percentage of 
ammonia, p hosphorus and COD.  Shabana  et al.

Data in (Fig.4) showed that repeated incubation of starved and unstarved 
Phormidium alginate beads in WI, WII and their mixture in a semi -continuous 
system for 5 consecutive cycles (10 days each) caused higher ammonia and Pharmaceutical wastewater treatment using free and immobilized Cyanobacteria

 phosphorus removal especially in t he first three cycles with higher percentage 
removal in starved than unstarved beads treatments. After the third cycle 
percentage removal of ammonia and phosphorus began to decrease. Ammonia 
removal percentage reached 100% in waste I in both starved and un starved beads 
where as it recorded 99.49% and 97.56% for waste II and for the mixture 97.82% 
and 94.54% in the second cycle. Phosphorus removal percentage reached 100% in 
starved WI in all cycles where as it reached 100% removal in cycle three for WII 
and mixture. Regarding to COD, higher percentage reduction was recorded 
especially in the first two cycles with higher percentage removal in starved than 
unstarved beads. The highest COD reduction percentage was obtained in the 
second cycle recording higher va lues in starved than unstarved Phormidium beads 
(86.73%, 69.26% and 66.52%) for WI, WII and their mixture. These data are in 
agreement with (Cruz  et al. , 2013)  who reported that degradation of beads is 
relatively slow; hence, there is sufficient time to efficiently remove nutrients by 
microbial agents immobilized inside the beads.  Still the beads survived long 
enough to allow completion of the removal of phospho rus, ammonia from 
wastewater; the contaminants in the wastewater significantly reduced the 
mechanical strength of the beads.  Faafeng et al. (1994 ) observed the degradation 
of sodium alginate beads, used for the immobilization of Selenastrum 
capricornutum , after keeping them in polluted wastewater with high phosphorous 
(P) and nitrogen (N) content for longer than two weeks. This instability of 
alginate happens when the gels are in contact with cations that serve as chelating 
agents and anti -gelling cations , such as dissolved phosphorus, EDTA citrates, 
sodium bicarbonate, and several more (Moreira et al.,  2006) . Ruiz -Marin et al. 
(2010 ) found that Scenedesmus obliquus  when tested in semi -continuous mode 
was more effective in removing N and P for longer perio ds than batch cultures. 
Immobilized S. obliquus  removed 97% and 90% of ammonium in  AWI (Artificial 
waste water immob ilization) and UWI (Urban waste water immobilization), 
respectively, during the first 48 h. After 250 h the removal decreased to 30 and 
10%. A  similar pattern was observed for phosphorous removal where 85% 
removal in AWI was maintained for four cycles, after which the system had a 
removal capacity of only 30%. They concluded that practically the semi -
continuous culture of S. obliquus  does not ap pear to allow a sustainable culture to 
treat wastewater which is in contrary to our results.  Shabana  et al.  
Egyptian J. of Phycol. Vol. 20, 2019   - 144 - 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Increasing algal cells entrapped within the beads didn't cause any 
significant improvement in nutrient removal (Lau et al., 1997) . On the contrary, 
superconcentrated cell stockings in the beads posed serious leakage problem 
(Robinson et al., 1986) . The study of (Abdel Hameed, 2007) , indicated that the 
beads concentrations in wastewater did not affect the efficiency of phosphate 
remo val. Also phosphate might be precipitated as calcium phosphate due to the 
presence of calcium ions in the alginate matrix (Jimenez - Perez et al., 2004)  and 
wastewater together with elevated pH values. Finally one can say that the 
immobilized cells either s tarved or unstarved showed greater efficiency for 
nutrient removal even after five repeated cycles. The present study recommended 
the upgrading of traditional operation systems to algal cell immobilization 
technique with low cost.  
 
During the present study , pH levels increased initially and thereafter 
remained in the range 7.3 to 9.1 (Fig.3). Increase in pH during phycoremedation is 
the usual behavior of blue green algae which favors their growth (Promya et al., 
2008) . Increasing pH represent the indirect r ole of microalgae to improve the 
treatment process. High levels of pH alter the physicochemical environment of the 
wastewater and cause phosphate and metals precipitation, ammonia stripping and 
disinfection (Abdulsada , 2014) . pH is considered as indicator of several 
biochemical activities, whose the photosynthesis and the biodegradation of the 
organic matter, the high pH values are attributed to higher photosynthetic rates of 
algae (Mahapatra et al.,  2013) . Microalgae species have different pH 
requirements. Chlorella vulgaris  can grow in broad range of pH however the 
maximum growth rate and biomass productivities are reported at pH 9 –10 (Daliry  
et al.,  2017) .

 Conclusion  
 If cyanobacterium Phormidium fragile is applied to natural discharge of 
pharmaceutical wastewater, it can utilize the pharmaceutical wastewater as 
nutrient source and will help in reducing the toxicity and facilitate recycling 
and reutilization of polluted water before discharging into surface aquatic 
systems providing a low cost, with no secondary pollution a nd naturally 
renewable technology.  
 Starved Phormidium alginate beads are more effective in removing N and P 
from wastewater than unstarved and free cells or blank alginate beads.  
 Repeated incubation of immobilized starved and unstarved Phormidium beads 
in WI, WII and their mixture in a semi -continuous system (5 consecutive 
cycles) caused increase in nutrients percentage removal which gives a 
promise to upgrading immobilization technique for wastewater treatment with 
low cost.

تعتبر الطحالب من أهم عوامل المعالجة البيولوجية و التي يتم إستخدامها في معالجة مياه  الصرف. 
يعتبر هذا البحث محاولة لدراسة إمكانية معالجة مياه الصرف الصيدالنية الناتجة عن المعامل WI 
 والعمليات اإلنتاجية  WII  في مصنع لألدوية بإستخدام السيانوبكتر فورميديام فراجيل الحر و المقيد. بعد
التجربة األولية أظهر  WI  سمية عالية، فقط تركيز0.5  % كان مؤثراً بينما تم إستخدام WII  عند تركيز
عالي وهو 40  % بعد10  أيام من التحضين (من تجربة منحنى النمو) في ظروف النمو المثلى. كان للطحلب
دوراً فعاالً في المعالجة البيولوجية حيث كانت أعلى نسبة إزالة للعوامل المختبرة  51.56 % ، 58.89 %
 لألمونيا ، 66.67  % ، 61.23  % للفوسفور ، 51.74  % ، 54.55  % لألكسجين الكيميائي المستهلك و 
37.05 % ، 59.85 % لألكسجين الحيوي الممتص لكل من المخلفWI   و الثانيWII  على التوالي مقارنة
بالمعامالت التي بدون طحلب. تسبب التجويع من النيتروجين لمدة 36  ساعة قبل الزراعة في زيادة نسبة
إزالة األمونيا ، الفوسفور و األكسجين الكيميائي المستهلك   مع زيادة جرعة الطحلب مقارنة بالخاليا غير 
المجوعة حيث سجلت 100  % ، 100  % و 72.56  % للمخلف األول WI   و 87.28  % ، 100  % و 
71.98   % للمخلف الثاني WII  على الترتيب مع زيادة جرعة الطحلب إلى 40  مل. كما وجد أن شدة 
اإلضاءة 2500 lux  و درجة حرارة  25 ºC  كانتا األفضل إلزالة المغذيات. على الجانب اآلخر تم تقدير
كلوروفيل أ ، الوزن الجاف و محتوى البروتين و الكربوهيدرات الكلية للطحلب في ال معامالت المختلفة. 
خالل هذه الدراسة إرتفعت مستويات األس الهيدروجيني و تراوحت بين  7.3  إلى9.1  . أظهرت المعامالت
بإستخدام كريات األلجينات للطحلب زيادة معنوية في إزالة كل من األمونيا ، الفوسفور ، األ كسجين 
الكيميائي المستهلك عنها في كريات األلجينات الخالية من الطحلب كما سجل التجويع قبل التقييد أعلى نسبة  
إزالة عند مقارنته بكريات الخاليا غير المجوعة أو الخاليا الحرة في كال المخلفين و كذلك مخلوط منهما 
بنسبة (1:1  ). عند تحضين كل من كريات الطحلب المجوعة و غير المجوعة في مخلفWI  ومخلف  
WII و المخلوط من كالهما في نظام زراعة شبه مستمر لخمس دورات متعاقبة ( 10  أيام لكل منها) وجد
زيادة في نسبة اإلزالة حتى الدورة الثالثة و ظل الطحلب محتفظاً بحيويته بداخل كريات األلجينات طويال 
مما يعطي أمل لتطوير تقنية التقييد لمعالجة مياه الصرف بتكلفة أقل.
