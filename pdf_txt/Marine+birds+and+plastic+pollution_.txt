Marine Ornithology 43: 53–64 (2015) Haney & Lee: Marine bird survey duration in the South Atlantic Bight 53
INTRODUCTION
Beginning in the 1970s, seabird management in the context of 
hydrocarbon exploitation (Ainley et al. 2012) prompted numerous inventories along the continental shelf margins of North America, Europe and elsewhere (e.g. Brown et al. 1975, Briggs et al. 1981, 1985, Gould et al. 1982, Powers 1983, Tasker et al. 1984, Abrams 
1985). Some survey programs were motivated by the sensitivity of 
seabirds to marine pollution, including floating plastics (Azzarello & Van Fleet 1987) and oil (Barrett 1979, Boersma 1986, Lee 1999). Competition with and mortality from commercial fisheries were the 
impetus behind others (Ainley et al. 1981, Furness 1982, Burger & 
Cooper 1984).
Regardless of purpose, the challenging logistics require critical 
evaluation of the methodology used in marine bird surveys (Briggs 
et al. 1985). Substantial time, personnel and costs are devoted to these survey programs, some of which span decades (Ainley et al. 1996, Veit et al. 1996, Ribic et al. 1997). Fees levied for dedicated 
ship use can exceed $5 000–$15 000 per day (Dufour 2012). Given 
the high financial costs, surveys are often done from ships of opportunity, which risks compromising the sample representation. Considerations of survey design thus beg scrutiny: How much survey effort is adequate? What is the minimum temporal and/or spatial coverage necessary to achieve optimal efficiency in offshore surveys? What consequences arise from using different appraisal methods for evaluating this adequacy?
Answers to these questions depend on the intent of the surveys and 
the nature of the particular research issue addressed (Ainley et al. 2012). Seabird responses to temporal or spatial changes in their environment might be evaluated at the focal individual (V otier et al. 
2010), population (Oedekoven et al. 2001) or multi-species level 
(Ballance et al. 1997). Therefore, different response variables may 
be required to address spatial pattern (Fritz et al. 2003, Johnston et al. 2014), numerical abundance (Maclean et al. 2013) or community 
structure (Wiens et al. 1996). 
In preliminary stages, survey programs for marine birds are 
often exploratory, intended to describe community composition 
for estimating feeding requirements (Schneider & Hunt 1982) 
or to assess species’ vulnerability to oil spills (Seip et al. 1991, Begg et al. 1997). Species richness and other community-level 
metrics may also be used as the primary response variable in some environmental impact assessments (Wiens et al. 1996). Confidence 
that most species have been detected in a survey is a fundamental prerequisite to any community-level analysis (Cam et al. 2002).
Here we use attributes of seabird community structure to 
retroactively examine minimal survey adequacy for two shipboard EV ALUATING SURVEY DURATION WITH COMMUNITY ATTRIBUTES

SUMMARY
HANEY , J.C. & LEE, D.S. 2015. Evaluating survey duration with community attributes of marine birds in the South Atlantic Bight. Marine Ornithology 43: 53–64.
The expense of conducting dedicated marine bird surveys creates incentives to optimize sampling effort. We appraised spatiotemporal 
effort in two shipboard surveys off the southeastern coast of the United States using analyses of seabird community structure. By applying 
randomization routines from both data-analytic (curve-fitting) and sampling-theoretic methods (bootstrap, jackknife, coverage), we assessed 
sampling adequacy for estimating numerical and biomass dominance, species accumulation rates and species richness. Maximum-likelihood estimators indicated that each survey had been carried out long enough for cumulative species richness (S
obs) to reach an apparent asymptote. 
Data stratification by season did not reduce the asymptotic-based estimates of minimum survey effort overall. Three estimators of total species richness (
Sˆmax) were equal to or less than values actually observed (S obs = 53 species in each survey). Five other estimators of 
Sˆmax exceeded S obs by 5%–18%, suggesting few species remained undetected by the time our surveys ended. Indeed, after >600 additional 
observation days, only six more offshore species were detected (all extralimitally rare), a tally that fell within error terms for estimators noted above. The two avifaunal surveys examined here were two to six times longer than required (36–65 days) to detect community dominants (species comprising ≥95% of numerical abundance and biomass). We conclude that sampling effort as appraised by community attributes was minimally adequate in both surveys. Measures of saturation in community structure can be applied while inventories are in progress to complement analyses of sample size based on statistical power, and may help minimize costs associated with over-sampling in dedicated 
surveys for marine birds. 
Key words: survey adequacy, sampling effort, South Atlantic Bight, western Atlantic Ocean, seabird community structure, species

studies in the South Atlantic Bight off the southeastern United 
States. These attributes include community dominance, total 
species richness and the rate at which new species were added as a function of continued survey effort. We distinguish this approach for evaluating survey adequacy from individual- or population-
based methods, including analysis of spatial changes (Fritz et 
al. 2003) or numerical trends (Kinlan et al. 2012, Maclean et al. 2013). Finally, and after re-evaluating our findings in the context of additional, later observations carried out in the same region, we offer recommendations for making objective decisions about whether 
marine bird survey effort can be deemed minimally adequate at a 
particular stage using measures of community composition.
STUDY AREA AND METHODS
Marine bird surveys were conducted in the South Atlantic Bight 
off the southeastern United States (Fig. 1). The survey in the northern portion of the bight off North Carolina was carried out mostly in an area of steep, converging bathymetric contours 
adjacent to the Outer Banks (OB). The survey in the south-central 
portion of the bight was conducted over the broad and shallow continental shelf in the large indentation of the coastline termed the Georgia Embayment (GE). 
Regional oceanography throughout this region is dominated by 
the Gulf Stream, which flows over the Blake Plateau just seaward of and adjacent to the continental shelf break (Olson et al. 1983). Along-shore current fluctuations promote episodically high but localized productivity in the offshore (Yoder et al. 1981, Atkinson 
& Targett 1983). Other distinguishing features of the South 
Atlantic Bight include high, turbid river discharges in the Georgia Embayment (Blanton & Atkinson 1983), greater temporal changes in offshore than in coastal winds (Weisberg & Pietrafesa 1983), and 
strong seasonal influence of atmospheric cooling on continental 
shelf water masses (Atkinson et al. 1983). These and other factors lead to substantial patchiness, i.e. high local variation in seabird distributions across the region (e.g. Lee 1995, Haney 1986, Hass 1997). Spatial dispersion of both surveys examined here was 
sufficient to represent most (if not all) of this environmental 
variation, from middle shelf marine regions proceeding seaward (see Results).
Survey techniques
Standardized counts for seabirds were available from 223 days 
of dedicated shipboard surveys using continuous counts off the Outer Banks (Moser & Lee 2012), and 143 days of opportunistic 
shipboard surveys at intervals using 300 m strip transects in the 
Georgia Embayment (Haney 1986). Data analyzed here were collected entirely in the open ocean (≤200 km from shore), outside sounds, bays, and inlets. OB surveys were carried out from 
1975 to 1989 and GE surveys from 1982 to 1985. Surveys were 
conducted during all months of the year, but effort was not allocated proportionately across seasons (Table 1). 
OB surveys recorded seabird locations throughout the day, and 
these were summed as daily totals within plotted transects of 
varying lengths and periods. GE surveys originally recorded bird count data within 15 min periods (Haney 1986). Seabird numbers from the GE survey were therefore re-binned into daily 
totals to achieve grain-size compatibility (Hortal et al. 2006) 
between the two surveys. Non-quantitative information on species composition was also gathered during each survey. Although this extra information was not compatible with most of the numerical analyses examined here, we report the additional species detected 
in the joint total of all species observed in both surveys (these 
totals are distinguished within and between surveys in Appendix 1, available on the website).

Data treatment
Survey data were organized into two large matrices (one for each 
region) consisting of individual dates, species and number of individuals per species. Each matrix was initially configured with the survey dates in chronological order. Matrix manipulations were the bases for three types of analyses, most of which used 
various randomization routines to evaluate simultaneously the 
number of species and either species’ abundances or presence/absence. Because statistical estimation of the number of species is notoriously resistant to a single solution (Foggo et al. 2003, Hortal 
et al. 2006, Reichert et al. 2010), we screened both data-analytic 
and sampling-theoretic approaches (Bunge & Fitzpatrick 1993). Performance among estimators was evaluated by conducting a regression analysis of the observed with the predicted accumulation curve, then comparing the amount of variance explained among the 
different model types. Standard notation is used throughout the text 
for species richness estimators (Chazdon et al. 1998).
Data-analytic methods. Data-analytic methods included both 
descriptive and diagnostic techniques. A general property of 
counting species is that more new species are detected during the initial stages of surveys, so relationships between species number and effort were examined first as curvilinear functions (Tjørve 2003). To remove influence of sample order in shaping 
the actual curves, we used an iterative routine to calculate average 
species richness (S) over the entire curve. Curve smoothing was accomplished by random permutations of the one-day survey samples with a procedure set to n = 1 000 runs (PISCES 1.2; 
Henderson & Seaby 1997). Curves depicting number of species in actual survey order were depicted with n = 1 run.
Asymptotic functions can be suitable for some species accumulation 
curves (Miller & Wiegert 1989, Soberon & Llorente 1993, Keating 
et al. 1998). If an asymptote for total species (
Sˆmax) can be estimated, 
the corresponding level of survey effort can be interpolated from 
the curve’s horizontal axis. A parametric maximum-likelihood 
estimator (Raaijmakers 1987) was used to calculate whether an 
asymptote was evident. Sampling was assumed complete if the asymptotic estimate was equal to or less than the observed value of S (Colwell & Coddington 1994). This diagnostic routine was applied 
incrementally to larger combinations of randomly shuffled one-day survey samples (n = 1 000 runs each) until this “stopping rule” (sensu Scharff et al. 2003) indicated that sampling was adequate.
Accurate estimation of 
Sˆmax may be compromised unless 
accumulation curves are derived from a homogeneous species pool (Hortal et al. 2006, Reichert et al. 2010). As a prelude to other 
estimations of 
Sˆmax (see below), we compared mean randomized 
accumulation curves (n = 1 000 runs) to a hypothetical curve 
expected if all individual birds recorded over all survey samples 
had been assigned randomly to individual samples (Colwell & 
Coddington 1994). If the expected curve (using the function described by Coleman et al. 1982) lies above the observed species accumulation curve, the samples are of diverse origin (e.g. Flather 
1996). If heterogeneity was detected, subsamples of species richness 
were re-binned and then analyzed separately by season to examine whether survey efficiency could be improved by this stratification. Improvement was indicated if asymptotes were identified for the separate accumulation curves, and if fewer cumulative survey-days 
(relative to the cumulative total) would have been required by this 
alternative allocation of survey days.Sampling-theoretic methods. Sampling-theoretic methods included 
estimation of both maximum species richness as well as functions 
that predicted the curve (or rate) of species accumulation. Survey adequacy was also evaluated by comparing differences (if any) between the total species richness observed and the maximum species richness that was estimated (
Sˆmax). Because no single model 
has been found to be universally suitable for species richness data (Bunge & Fitzpatrick 1993), a variety of non-parametric models 
were tested. Models included bootstrap, jackknife, and coverage 
(the latter were both incidence-based and abundance-based [ACE]; Chazdon et al. 1998).
Two different Chao estimators of 
Sˆmax were used. An abundance-
based estimator and variance for species richness (Chao 1984), respectively, are given by the following equations:
SChao 1=Sobs+(F12/2F2), and var (SChao 1)=F2(G4/4+G3+G2/2),
Sobs is the total number of species observed in all samples pooled, 
Fi is the number of species that have exactly i individuals when all 
samples are pooled, and G = F 1/F2. An incidence-based estimator 
and variance of species richness (Chao 1987), respectively, are given by the following equations:
SChao 2=Sobs+(Q12/2Q2), and var (SChao 2)=F2(G4/4+G3+G2/2),
In this estimator, Q 1 is the number of species that occur in exactly 
one sample (uniques), and Q 2 is the number of species that occur in 
exactly two samples (duplicates).
Two additional coverage estimators were used for species richness 
based on abundance (Chao & Lee 1992). The general form of these ACE estimators is given by the following equation:
SACE=Sabund+Srare
CACE+F1
CACEACE2γ, 
where Sabund is the number of abundant species (each with more than 
10 individuals) when all samples are pooled, S rare is the number of 
rare species (each with 10 or fewer individuals) when all samples are pooled. Therefore:
ACE2=max(Srare
CACEi(i1)F1
i=110
(Nrare)(Nrare1)1,0), γ Nrare=iFi
i=110
CACE=1(F2
Nrare), , and
as computed in Henderson & Seaby (1997).
The bootstrap estimator of Sˆmax used here was that described by 
Smith & van Belle (1984). Jackknife estimators of species richness 
included both the first-order (Burnham & Overton 1978, Heltshe 
& Forrester 1983) and the second-order, robust-limiting forms 
(Burnham & Overton 1979, Palmer 1991). Non-parametric estimates of 
Sˆmax were computed with n = 143–1 000 runs of randomly 
shuffled one-day samples from each survey. Computational routines for these and related estimators are available from Colwell (2014), 
Henderson & Seaby (1997), and Hines et al. (1999).
Community dominance. Products of mean body mass (Appendix 
1, available on the website) and the number of individuals for each 
species recorded were used to calculate the total abundance and 
biomass of the seabird community pooled over all samples collected across the entire duration in each of the two surveys. This procedure Marine Ornithology 43: 53–64 (2015)56 Haney & Lee: Marine bird survey duration in the South Atlantic Bight 
formed the basis of two retrospective analyses aimed at measuring 
saturation in community dominance.
In the first analysis, we computed the minimum number of survey 
days required to detect only those species that composed 95% of 
the total abundance and biomass. This approach involved ranking 
species by their importance values (numbers or contributions to total biomass) until the cumulative total came to 95%, then identifying the shortest duration that would have detected these same species, given the actual start date and sampling sequence 
used in each survey.
In the second analysis, Monte Carlo trials were employed with 
different start dates assigned randomly to hypothetical surveys. 
Using subsamples of species richness from the real surveys, 
hypothetical surveys were “conducted” for the same duration identified in the analysis described above. This resampling approach therefore simulated the extent to which alternative start dates (as surveys can only progress forward) might have influenced 
identification of the community dominants.
Post-survey evaluation of effort and cost
To appraise whether our surveys were carried out long enough using 
compositional criteria, we compared the species richness totals we observed (and their statistical estimators) to the cumulative species totals detected later as the consequence of two decades of additional offshore marine bird observations conducted in the same 
region. Between 1988 and the present, one of us (D.S.L.), as well as 
commercial operators, ran various one-day excursions in the South Atlantic Bight. The longest-running excursions have been those off North Carolina by Brian Patteson (http://seabirding.com/), most of 
which were conducted off the Outer Banks coastline (Fig. 1).
We assessed the species composition recorded in these additional 
observations (n = 619 survey days from 1988 to 2013) for any offshore species that had not been recorded during our earlier 
surveys. We interpolated the number of additional survey days that 
were required to detect each additional species. Then we derived a range of equivalent costs for dedicated ship time for this added survey effort based on the average 2012 daily charge rates for coastal- 
($5 000–$10 000) and regional-capable vessels ($10 000–$15 000) 
that are suitable for outer continental shelf surveying, and operated expressly for such purposes under the Atlantic fleet of the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (Dufour 2012).

RESULTS
Species richness
Both surveys recorded a total of 53 seabird species, but this 
number was achieved in 80 fewer sampling days in the GE (Fig. 2). Maximum-likelihood estimators identified asymptotes for each of 
the two survey’s seasonally combined daily samples. The asymptote 
for the OB survey corresponded to 46 species and 88 days of surveys. The asymptote for the GE survey corresponded to 52 species and 135 days of surveys. Distinct curve shapes of each asymptote, 
however, indicated that the underlying statistical functions for 
the maximum-likelihood estimators were different (Fig. 3). Of estimators examined, the maximum-likelihood estimator provided the poorest fit to the entire observed accumulation curves (Table 2), tending to greatly overshoot S during the earliest stages of these 
surveys (Fig. 3).
Although species accumulation curves were asymptotic for 
each survey, additional diagnostic tests indicated that the daily 
samples collected during each survey were heterogeneous (Fig. 4). 
Differences between the observed and homogeneous community curves ranged from about 5 to 17 species, and 5 to 18 species, during the first 20 days of the OB and GE surveys, respectively.
Despite this heterogeneity, stratifying samples by season did not 
materially reduce the asymptote-based estimates of minimum survey effort. Except for the OB during summer, no asymptotes were identified for any of the other single-season species accumulation 
curves (Table 3). Even so, values for 
Sˆmax were within a single species 
of the observed richness for the two remaining seasons in the OB 
area. Observed and estimated values of Sˆmax in the GE were closest in 
summer (<2 species), despite relatively few days of sampling during that season (Table 1). Asymptotic estimators for 
Sˆmax during winter 
and transitional seasons in the GE were at least 3 species greater, however, than the values of species richness observed.
Three of eight estimators for species richness were equal to or less 
than the species richness actually observed in the surveys (Table 2). Coverage estimators gave highly accurate point estimates for 
Sˆmax in 
each survey, and explained more than 99% of the variance in species richness along the entire accumulation curves. The bootstrapped 
estimator for 
Sˆmax gave the next most accurate estimate of total 
species richness in each survey. The bootstrap also explained high 
variance (>98%) in species richness along the entire accumulation 
curve. In general, non-parametric estimates of species richness 
in the GE were slightly higher than comparable values from the OB, but low precision in these estimators casts doubt on attaching particular biological significance to the differences (Table 2).
Species dominance
As few as 18 species contributed ≥95% of all individual seabirds 
ultimately recorded during the GE survey (Table 4). Based on the 
Fig. 3. Minimum survey effort interpolated from an asymptotic estimate of total species richness, 
Sˆmax, for each of two surveys 
of marine birds off the coast of the southeastern United States. Asymptotes were calculated with a maximum-likelihood estimator 
(Raaijmakers 1987).

actual chronological sequence of the GE survey and the shortest 
possible detection time for these 18 dominants, a minimum of 66 consecutive survey days, or 46% of this survey program’s total 
duration, would have been required to record dominant species. 
With a random start date, a hypothetical GE survey with duration 66 days had a 95% likelihood of recording all 18 dominants (n = 20 trials). As few as 16 species contributed ≥95% of all seabird 
biomass detected in the GE survey. Based on actual chronological 
sequence and the shortest possible detection time to observe these dominants, a minimum of 65 consecutive survey days, or 45% of this survey program’s total duration, would have been required to detect these species. With random start dates, a hypothetical GE 
survey with duration 65 days had a 95% likelihood of recording 
these same 16 dominants (n = 20 trials).
As few as 14 species contributed ≥95% of all individual seabirds 
ultimately recorded during the OB survey (Table 4). Based on 
actual chronological sequence of the OB survey and the shortest possible detection time for these 14 dominants, a minimum of 43 consecutive survey days, or 19% of this survey program’s total duration, would have been required to record these species. With 
a random start date, a hypothetical OB survey of duration 43 days 
had only a 45% likelihood of recording all 14 dominants (n = 20 trials). A hypothetical OB survey with a duration equivalent to that used in the GE analysis above (66 days), however, would have a 
60% likelihood of recording these 14 dominants (n = 20 trials). 
As few as 11 species contributed ≥95% of all seabird biomass in the OB survey. Based on the actual chronological sequence of the OB survey and the shortest possible detection time for these 11 dominants, a minimum of 43 consecutive survey days, or 19% of 
this survey program’s total duration, would have been required to 
detect these species. With a random start date, a hypothetical OB survey with duration 43 days had a 55% likelihood of recording these same 11 dominants (n = 20 trials).
Consequences of “missed” species
The joint total for both South Atlantic Bight surveys was 60 species, 
not including those species detected outside the quantitative portions 
of the surveys analyzed here (Appendix 1, available on the website). 
As of 2014, 60 species represents about 75% of a total pool (sensu Cam et al. 2000) consisting of all aquatic bird species known 
to occur from the region’s marine waters (e.g. see http://www.carolinabirdclub.org/brc/checklist_of_North_Carolina_birds.html). Most of the species we “missed” during our surveys were lacking either as a result of revised taxonomy (e.g. Patteson & Armistead 
2004) or because particular taxa (e.g. certain sea ducks, grebes, 
larids) inhabit primarily neritic waters very near shore, habitats that we did not sample effectively from ships. However, one primarily offshore alcid known from the region was certainly missed during 
the quantitative phases of our surveys (Atlantic puffin Fratercula 
arctica), and five offshore procellariiforms ultimately recorded in the region went undocumented in our surveys (Table 5).
If added to our either of our survey totals, these six taxa (11% of 
each survey’s S
obs) bring the total to 59 species, a value nearly 
identical to several point estimates for Sˆmax, or within the confidence 
limits of other estimators (Table 2). With the exception of Fratercula 
arctica, which is casual to rare in the region (Lowther et al. 2002), all other species detected after the mid-1980s are extralimital to the 
South Atlantic Bight. The second species added, Swinhoe’s Storm-Petrel Oceanodroma monorhis, took 117 additional days to detect, a 
duration that hypothetically would cost $585 000–$1 755 000 using 
conventional research ships (Table 5). It took 579 additional days to detect the 59th species, Black-browed Albatross Thalassarche melanophrys, a survey duration equivalent to at least $2 895 000 in 
dedicated ship costs. 
DISCUSSION
Survey duration in the South Atlantic Bight
As far as we are aware, ours is the first attempt to test various 
quantitative attributes of community structure to assess adequacy of survey duration for marine birds. Whether we gauged adequacy by species richness or community dominance, we conclude that total duration for each South Atlantic Bight marine bird survey was 
minimally adequate. Indeed, community-level measures indicate

that our surveys had been conducted unnecessarily long in the 
context of our research goals. Setting aside extralimital species, 
detecting only community dominants could have been accomplished 
in as few as 36 to 65 total survey days (Table 4). This level of effort corresponds to an estimated nominal cost of $180 000 to about 
$1 000 000 in dedicated ship time. Judged by the same measures of 
community dominance, however, our surveys were conducted two 
to six times longer than necessary. Such supplemental effort in one 
survey alone could equate to overspending on dedicated ship use by as much as $2 800 000.
Substantially less effort was required to detect community dominants than to achieve saturation in species richness (Tables 2, 4). Simulations indicated a high probability of detecting regularly occurring community dominants with less than half the survey effort actually expended in GE. Off the OB, however, simulations 
indicated only modest probability (≤60%) of detecting dominants 
using similar survey durations. This disparity might be explained by differences between the two surveys with respect to spatial or temporal allocation of sampling across the continental shelf. Also, 
the OB survey devoted less effort in winter during its final stages, 
whereas simulations revealed a high likelihood of detecting only community dominants had the survey begun before day 100. If community metrics are contemplated as stopping rules (Scharff et al. 2003), we recommend that investigators: (1) survey evenly 
throughout each season to increase the likelihood of temporal 
representation, and (2) adopt quantitative criteria that yield a high probability (e.g. ≥95%) of detecting all dominants. Monte Carlo trials or other resampling methods can be used to test such 
dominance-based stopping rules (cf. Magnussen et al. 2010).
Although we detected substantial heterogeneity in our daily 
samples of species richness (Fig. 4), we nevertheless ultimately found asymptotes to 
Sˆmax (Fig. 3). We attribute this somewhat 
unexpected finding to the peculiar variability that is common to marine bird survey data. Numerical variability in species richness 
can stem from several sources, including any differences in total 
time counting seabirds among survey days. Local seabirds are also patchily distributed due to behavioral (Haney et al. 1992), trophic (Moser & Lee 2012) and oceanographic factors (Hass 1997), any of which may affect a species total by day. Weather can also alter survey date, duration and visibility of detection. Nevertheless, based on the observed saturation in species richness (e.g. Fig. 3; 
see also Table 5), we inferred that spatial coverage of our surveys 
was adequate (cf. Longino & Colwell 1997) to represent primary habitats in our study area (e.g. inner vs. outer shelf, Gulf Stream eddies, etc.).
Disparities between scales of data collection and environmental 
patchiness create noise from binning data into sampling frames of essentially arbitrary grain size (Haney & Solow 1992). Although this noise might increase differences in species richness observed among 
samples, it need not greatly influence the species accumulation 
curve. Indeed, several species richness estimators (e.g. ACE, Chao
1, 
jackknife, bootstrap) have been shown to be robust and precise despite variations in the grain size elected for the sampling frame 
(e.g. Hortal et al. 2006). 
As in other species inventories (Longino & Colwell 1997), 
stratification did not reduce our asymptotic-based estimates for total 
survey effort (Table 3). This may be because seabird occurrence 
and species composition are partially independent of the seasons that we used for stratification; seabirds in the South Atlantic Bight originate from tropical, subtropical and temperate regions in both southern and northern hemispheres (Lee & Booth 1979, Lee 1995). 
Sub-adults of several species may reside at sea in this portion of 
the Atlantic for years before breeding. Some seabird communities may thus conform to those special cases in which a well-known or -studied taxon (Soberon & Llorente 1993) leads to well-behaved 
statistical properties in the underlying species richness data (e.g. 
Keating et al. 1998).
Choosing a community-based estimator for appraising survey duration
In this study, we used asymptotic estimates for species richness 
in two regional marine bird communities strictly as an informal, practical and descriptive guide to evaluate whether survey duration

was minimally adequate. Before our two surveys, the seabird fauna 
in this portion of the western Atlantic Ocean were very poorly known. 
Community inventories carry an inherent risk that some species, typically the rarest, go undetected (Gotelli & Colwell 2001, Dorazio et al. 2006, Chao et al. 2009). Observations after our surveys ended 
confirmed that only species extralimital to the South Atlantic Bight 
had gone undetected (Table 5). For purposes of an environmental assessment, none of these species could be deemed at population risk within our study regions (and, in some cases globally, e.g. Fregetta tropica). Moreover, our survey durations were sufficient to 
detect the presence of arguably the most endangered seabird in the 
northwest Atlantic Ocean, the Bermuda Petrel Pterodroma cahow (see Appendix 1, available on the website).
In addition, we have shown that surveys carried out longer than 
necessary, at least from the standpoint of merely adding extralimital species, may carry exceedingly high costs. Using dedicated ships in the South Atlantic Bight to detect ever more species would have cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per species (Table 5). The 
cumulative costs to merely add more species to the community 
composition would have been even more expensive, exceeding millions of dollars. Thus, from a fiscal standpoint, there is great incentive to sample seabird communities with surveys that are both 
pragmatic and efficient.
More formally, the number of species detected in a survey (S
obs) is 
typically expected to be less than the number of species actually 
present ( Sˆmax). Unless differences between S obs and Sˆmax are small, 
or biases that deflate S obs remain constant, comparisons of relative 
species richness across space or time are problematic (Conroy & Noon 1996, Nichols et al. 1998). Ideally, detection probabilities for 
species in a community should be very close to 1 and should not vary greatly across sites or times (Boulinier et al. 1998). If detection biases are large (e.g. observability varies among species; Barbraud & Thiebot 2009), comparing species richness between surveys may 
be unwise. The probability of detecting all species in the South 
Atlantic Bight was likely close to 1, given that there are virtually no diving species in the offshore; that is, there is “no place to hide” for birds in open marine habitat. Because failures to detect bird species can be attributed to fundamental rarity instead of a truly low rate of 
detectability (Dorazio et al. 2006), we conclude that the differences 
between S
obs and Sˆmax illustrated in our study arose largely from 
estimator performance.
Diverging performance (Table 2) in the various estimators for 
Sˆmax was hardly unexpected. Because of unique properties of the 
individual data sets that underlie species richness, identifying a 
consistently accurate estimator has proven elusive (e.g. Esty 1986, 
O’Hara 2005). After considering bias, accuracy and precision 
(Hellman & Fowler 1999, Walther & Moore 2005), the performance of 
Sˆmax depends on inherent attributes of community structure 
(Foggo et al. 2003), prevalence of rare species (Reichert et al. 2010) 
and extent to which the true number of species in the community is 
known (Ugland et al. 2003).
With the data generated from our study, more than one type of 
estimator gave fairly accurate predictions of the point estimate, 
Sˆmax, within and between the two surveys, some with confidence 
limits (Table 2) that encompassed addition even of exceedingly rare species observed well after our surveys ended (Table 5). 
Because our focus here was exploratory and practical, however, 
we are reluctant to endorse particular quantitative estimators for all situations. Maximum likelihood was useful only for 
Sˆmax, not the 
entire accumulation curve (Table 2, Fig. 3). Coverage estimators are “better understood and…behaved” (Bunge & Fitzpatrick 1993), 
and they delivered accurate estimates for S
obs in our surveys (Table 
2). The Chao 1 (1984) ACE and the first-order jackknife were almost 
exactly accurate for Sˆmax (Table 2), once the additional species 
recorded after our surveys were included (Table 5). The non-
parametric estimators are less biased and more precise than species 
accumulation curves (Brose et al. 2003). They have also performed 
well in other species inventories (Walther & Morand 1998, Foggo et al. 2003, Walther & Moore 2005), including surveys of bird communities (Walther & Martin 2001).
Survey duration in other contexts
We regard our approach for evaluating survey duration as 
representing the “floor” rather than “ceiling” for effort needed to 
characterize key species in a seabird community within a defined 
study area. Whereas minimum survey effort that fails to meet statistical criteria for community composition could be difficult to justify, additional considerations govern whether effort is 
sufficient for other purposes, including the frequency of sampling. 
For example, surveys spaced approximately three to five days apart have been found to be statistically independent, and surveys conducted over one to three years captured much of the inter-annual variance for marine habitats off the eastern United States (see 
Kinlan et al. 2012).
Choice of appropriate sample size is always a critical part of 
research planning (Morrison 1988, Dale et al. 1991). Our proposed 
cut-off criteria for survey duration (e.g. Fig. 3) are suitable only 
when community composition is the response variable (Wiens et al. 1996, V otier et al. 2004, Ainley et al. 2012). If population trends 
are the focus, statistical power analysis might guide decisions on whether enough samples were collected (e.g. Hatch 2003, Kinlan 
et al. 2012). Detecting offshore population changes may prove 
difficult if power gains cannot be achieved through extending duration, frequency and spatial extent of surveys. Maclean et al. 
(2013) report limited ability to circumvent this problem in one 
survey program. In such cases, other response variables, including 
changes to species composition (Wiens et al. 1996, Tittensor et al. 2010) or spatial pattern (Lapeña et al. 2010), may help inform impact assessments for marine birds in offshore marine environments. Algorithms based on bagged decision trees can also 
identify consistent aggregations or “hotspots” of seabird abundance 
(e.g. Nur et al. 2011, Santora et al. 2011).
Evaluating survey duration using community attributes could inform 
the selection of sampling lengths in preliminary or pilot settings 
elsewhere. One potential application is for identifying the minimum survey duration for impact assessments at offshore wind energy projects (Garthe & Hüppop 2004, Drewitt & Langston 2006, Watts 2010). Before siting of wind power installations, detecting bird 
species most susceptible to avoidance behavior (Desholm & Kahlert 
2005), collision risk (Johnston et al. 2014) and habitat loss from turbines or other physical structures (Fox & Petersen 2006, Hüppop et al. 2006) is vital. Individual sites considered for offshore wind 
development are typically far smaller than our survey areas (Fig. 1), 
so we would not expect that minimum-length surveys would require as many as 65 days in order to detect community dominants over such local scales. To avoid any temporal bias in species detections, seasonal representation should be addressed explicitly.Marine Ornithology 43: 53–64 (2015) Haney & Lee: Marine bird survey duration in the South Atlantic Bight 61
Appraising survey duration using community-level criteria is also 
relevant to planning new large-scale, region-wide surveys. The Gulf of Mexico remains the least-studied offshore region for seabirds in the continental United States. Despite an immense infrastructure 
for offshore energy in the region (>4 000 offshore oil and gas 
production platforms; Dismukes 2010), long-term, baseline seabird 
surveys are still inexplicably lacking for the entire Gulf. Given parallels between the South Atlantic Bight and Gulf of Mexico’s marine environments and seabird faunas, and given adequate spatial 
dispersion, we recommend that future Gulf surveys be conducted 
for at least 36–65 total days. Duration could be iteratively tested while such surveys were in progress using tools that rely upon any of several saturation criteria available (e.g. Table 2).
