Abstract:  Enzymatic decolorization of Malachite Green (MG) dye was studied using crude enzyme from a 
newly isolated Bacillus cereus str ain wwcp1. 98 % decolorization efficien cy was achieved within 24 hours using 
an initial dye concentration of 1.0 x 10-5M. Batch experimental results revealed that the decolorization process 
was highly dependent on contact time, initial MG concentration, aqueous solution temperature and pH. 
Biod egradation of MG dye was monitored spectrophotometrically  and metabolites confirmed by thin layer 
chromatography (TLC). The comparison of TLC chromatograms before and af ter decolorization confirmed that  
crude protease enzyme ha d the ability to degrade MG d ye. The r esults provide evidence that the crude enzyme 
from Bacillus cereus strain wwcp1 is an effective and potential candidate for industrial wastewater treatment.

I. Introduction  
Water pollution due to release of industrial wastewater has become a serious environmental problem in 
almost every industry using dyes to color products. Wastewater from textile, paper, leather, cosmetic, food, and 
plastic industr ies often contains synthetic dyes that are toxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic [1, 2] . The strong 
color of industrial wastewaters containing  dyes even at a small concentration  has a huge impact on the aquatic 
environment due to  their turbidity, increased ch emical oxygen demand (COD ), and reducing light penetration, 
which has adverse effects on photosynthetic phenomena. Among many classes of synthetic dyes used in the 
industries, triphenyl methane group of dyes such as malachite green and crystal violet const itute a major and 
versatile group that play a predominant role in almost every type of application [3]. 
Malachite oxalate green dye (MG) [(C 23H25N2)∙(C 2HO 4)]2∙C 2H2O4], (Bis[[4 -[4-(dimethylamino) 
benzhydrylidene]cyclohexa -2,5-dien-1-ylidene]dimethylammonium] oxalate, dioxalate; N,N,N',N' -Tetramethyl -
4,4'-diaminotriphenylcarbenium oxalate) MW 929.03g (Figure 1) has been found to be highly toxic to 
mamm alian cells; promote hepatic tumor formation in rodents and cause reproductive abnormalities in rabbits 
and fish [4]. It was nominated by the Food and Drug Administration as a priority chemical for carcinogenicity 
testing by the National Toxicology Program me of the USA [5]. The need to maintain a cleaner environment for 
the survival of both aquatic and terrestrial lives has forced many governments to established environmental 
restrictions with regard to the quality of colored effluents forcing dye houses to  decolorize their effluents before 
discharging. Treatment of industrial wastewater containing dyes is an essential, but difficult process because 
dyes usually have a complex aromatic structure which makes them resistant to biodegradation by conventional 
biological treatments.  
Several methods have been developed to remove synthetic dyes from wastewaters in order to decrease 
their impact on the environment [6, 7] . Conventional physicochemical methods such as adsorption with 
activated carbon, coagulation, prec ipitation, solvent extraction, membrane filtration, chemical oxidation, 
ozonation, and flocculation have been used to treat dye containing effluents; however, most of these methods 
are expensive or require  additional  chemicals [8]. The decolorization of dy e in wastewater using microbial 
enzymes has been a subject of many studies in recent years due to their low cost of production and efficient 
application. Compared to physicochemical treatment methods, the enzymatic treatment of dyes have low energy 
cost an d are more ecofriendly process although not commonly used in the textile industries [9]. Enzymatic Decol orization of Malachite Green Dye by a Newly Isolated Bacillus Cereus Strain wwcp1

Extremophile like alkaliphiles bacteria exhibit the ability to grow at the extre mely harsh environmental 
conditions such as high pH and temperature, high levels of salinity or salt, and pressure which critically 
influence their growth. Products of industrial importance from alkaliphiles have been commercialized, the most 
successful of  which have been in the detergent and food industries [10]. However, relatively few studies have 
been reported on the application of alkaline enzyme in decolorization of organic dyes. The aim of present study 
is to investigate the ability of crude protease  enzyme from newly isolated Bacillus cereus strain wwcp1 in 
decolorizing MG  dye. Batch experiment were contacted to investigate and optimize the effects of contact time, 
pH, initial MG concentration, aqueous solution temperature on the decolorization of MG  dye by crude protease 
enzyme. The resultant metabolites were analyzed by thin layer chromatography.  
 
II. Materials And Methods  
A cationic basic dye, malachite green oxalate, was obtained from Loba -Austria and used without 
further purification. MG solution was  prepared from stock solution of 1.0×10-4M (92.903 mg/L) by dilution. All 
solutions were prepared in double distilled water and pH adjusted by adding either 0.1 M HCl or NaOH . 
  
1.1 Microorganism Isolation and enzyme production  
Dye-decolorizing bacteria were i solated from mud water samples obtained from Lake Bogoria. One 
gram of the contaminated soil sample was weighed aseptically into 100 ml of sterile distilled water, agitated for 
45 minutes on a shaker and 0.2 ml spread on casein agar plates before incubatin g at 37°C for 2 days. Protease 
producing strains were selected by spotting the bacterial cultures on culturing medium containing Reese Agar 
medium [11].  Four positive colonies were identified by the formation of zone of clearance around the colony. 
The zo ne was made clearer by flooding the plates with a solution of 5% Trichloroacetic acid (TCA). The 
diameter of the bacterial colony and the total zone of enzyme activity including the growth diameter were 
measured in each case. Bacillus cereus strain wwcp (G enBank accession No. KM201428) exhibited maximum 
clear zone around the colony indicating high protease activity and thus selected for enzyme production. The 
medium for crude enzyme production contained 0.5 % casein and 0.25% glucose. 500mL Erlenmeyer flask s 
containing 100mL of media plugged in cotton and aluminum foil was sterilized in autoclave at 121ºC (15 lb) for 
15 min and after cooling the flask was inoculated with 5% over night grown seed bacterial culture. The 
inoculated medium was incubated at 45°C on a rotary shaker (140 rpm) incubator. After 72 hours, the culture 
medium was centrifuged at 5000 rpm and 4°C for 15 min to obtain the crude extract which served as crude 
enzyme source .  
 
1.2 Assay of Enzyme Activity  
Protease activity in the crude enzyme was assayed by the modified  Tsuchida  procedure  [12] using 1% 
casein as substrate. Casein solution (1.0 ml) was mixed with an equal volume of crude protease enzyme solution 
and incubated at 45˚C for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 4 ml of  10% (w/v) chilled 
trichloroacetic acid and reaction mixture allowed to stand in ice for 20 min to precipitate the insoluble proteins. 
The mixture was centrifuged to  obtain  the supernatant . 5ml of 0.4M Na 2CO 3 and 1 ml of one fold diluted Folin 
ciocalteau r eagent  was added to the supernatant which was further incubated for 30 min utes to develop the 
color. The absorbance was measured against an appropriate blank at 660 nm using a UV-VIS 
spectrophotometer.  
 
1.3 Effect of pH on crude proteases enzyme activity  
In or der to determine the optimum pH for protease activity, the crude enzyme was assayed in 1% 
Casein (w/v) as substrate dissolved in buffers of different pH ranging from 4 to 12. The pH was adjusted using 
the following buffer systems at 0.1M concentration: ace tate (pH 4, 5), sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6, 7), Tris 
HC1 buffer (pH 8) and glycine -NaOH (pH 9 - 12). Reaction mixtures were incubated at 45°C for 30 min before 
measuring the enzyme activity.  Enzymatic Decol orization of Malachite Green Dye by a Newly Isolated Bacillus Cereus Strain wwcp1

1.4.1 Determination of wavelength of maximum ab sorbance (λ max) for Malachite green  
A 1.0 x 10-5M solution of MG dye was prepared from the stock solution of 1.0 x 10-4M. A sample of 
dye solution in a cuvette was placed in the UV -VIS spectrophotometer that had been set to the absorbance 
mode. Starting fr om the lower wavelength (400 nm), the wavelength was adjusted and the wavelength together 
with the corresponding absorbance recorded over the entire wavelength range. The spectrophotometer was then 
set to the maximum wavelength value (617 nm) for all the a bsorbance measurements thereafter.  
 
1.4.2 Determination of the effect of contact time on MG dye decolorization  
10ml of c rude protease enzyme was mixed with 40 ml of 1.0 x 10-5M MG dye solution at room 
temperature in 100ml conical flask on a Thermolyne Orbital sh aker at 150 rpm. The pH of the crude enzyme 
and dye solution was adjusted to pH 8.5. After a time interval of 10 minutes, aliquots from the reaction mixture 
were analyzed for residual MG concentrations using a UV –Vis spectrophotometer (UV -min 1240 SHIMADZU ) 
monitoring changes in absorbance at 617 nm. Control tests were conducted w here crude protease enzyme had 
been replaced by deionized water. All experiments were performed in triplicate and results expressed as the 
mean values.  
 
1.4.3 Determination of the effect  of initial MG dye concentration on decolorization  
The effect of initial dye concentration was investigated at room temperature (25 ˚C) and pH 8.5. 40 ml 
of MG dye of concentrations at various increasing concentrations ranging from 1.0 x 10-6M, to 1.0 x 10-5M was 
placed in 100ml conical flask and 10 ml of crude protease enzyme added and placed on an orbital shaker. 
Samples were collected from the flask at various time intervals and analyzed for residual MG concentration. The 
rate of decolorization was expre ssed as the percentage decrease in absorbance at the peak wavelength.  
 
1.4.4 Determination of the effect of temperature on MG dye decolorization  
The effect of temperature on MG dye decolorization was investigated at temperature ra nge of 25 - 70˚C and pH 
8.5. 40  ml of MG dye of initial concentration of 1.0 x 10-5M was mixed with 10 ml of crude protease enzyme 
both pre equilibrated at the study temperature for 30 minutes before mixing in 100ml conical flask. Absorbance 
reading was ta ken at an interval of 10 minutes till equilibrium was attained.  
 
1.4.5 Determination of the effect of pH on MG dye decolorization  
The effect of pH was investigated at room temperature (25˚C) and a pH range of 4 -11 for 5 and 12 hours.  10 ml 
of crude enzyme at a ppropriate pH was mixed with 40 ml of 1.0 x 10-5M MG dye solution in 100ml conical 
flask. The rate of decolorization was expressed as the percentage decrease in absorbance at the peak wavelength.  
 
1.4.6 Assay of metabolites formed from the biodegradation  
After c omplete decolorization, the metabolites from biodegraded products were extracted with equal volume of 
ethyl acetate (25: 25 ml). The extracts were dried over anhydrous Na 2SO 4 and evaporated to dryness in rotary 
evaporator. The dry crystals were placed in 2 5 ml conical flask and 5ml of methanol added to dissolve the 
metabolites for TLC analysis. Metabolite formation was examined by thin layer chromatography (TLC) using 
silica gel activated in chloroform. The solvent system used was n -propanol: ethyl acetate:  acetic acid: distilled 
water (6:1:1:2 v/v). The separated products were visualized in iodine chamber.  
 
II. Results And Discussion  
2.1 Effect of pH on crude proteases enzyme activity  
The crude protease enzyme from Bacillus Cereus Strain wwcp1 showed good protease activity over a 
broader pH range in alkaline media. The optimum pH was found to be 11 (Figure. 2), indicating that th e enzyme 
is alkaline protease. Similar results were also observed in the protease produced by Aspergillus clavatus [13]. Enzymatic Decol orization of Malachite Green Dye by a Newly Isolated Bacillus Cereus Strain wwcp1

2.2 Determination of the effect of contact time on MG decolorization  
The effect of contact time on MG dye decolorization by crude enzyme was examined by varying the 
time of in cubation and the results presented in Figure 3. The results show  that dye decolorization was rapid 
within the first 4 hours with approximately 82 % dye decolorization. The change in percentage decolorization 
after the 4th hour became relatively gradual attaining  equilibrium at the 20th hour with 97.5 % dye decolorization. 
This observation suggested that the initial four hours was significant for dyes decolorization but  quite slow after 
fourth hour which may be probably due to products inhibition. These resu lts were in agreement with earlier 
published work of decolorization of textile dyes [14].

2.3 Effect of pH on Malachite Green dye Decolorization  
Enzymes are greatly affecte d by variation in pH. The effect of pH on decolorization of MG dye by 
crude protease enzyme was investigated at various pH values and results presented in Figure 4. It can be inferred 
that at a pH below 5, there was significantly very low decolorization ra te but when the pH increased above 6.0, 
the rate of decolorization rapidly increased from 21% at pH 6 to 98% at pH 11. The result shows that the 
optimum pH for efficient MG dye decolorization was between pH 9 and 11.  These results obviously present an 
advantage from industrial application point of view since most of dye effluents are characterized by alkaline pH 
under which crude protease enzyme works optimally. These findings are consistent with related studies done on 
decolorization of textile azo dyes b y newly isolated halophilic and halotolerant bacteria  [15]. Enzymatic Decol orization of Malachite Green Dye by a Newly Isolated Bacillus Cereus Strain wwcp1

2.4 Effect of Temperature on Malachite Green dye Decolorization  
Temperature plays an important role in enzyme activity. Effect of temperature on decolorization of MG 
dyes was investigated at temperature range of 25 - 70˚C and results presented in Figure 5. The results show that 
the rate of MG dye decolorization increased with increase in temperature between 25 ˚C, and 40˚C with 
decolorization ef ficiency increasing with increase of incubation time. The optimum temperature for crude 
protease enzymes was found to be 40˚C with 83% decolorization efficiency after 4 hours. At elevated 
temperature above 50°C, the rate of dye decolorization increased dur ing the first 20 minutes but after one hour, 
percent dye decolorization remarkably decreased. This can be attributed to the denaturation of enzyme and 
thermal inactivation of enzyme under the operati ng temperature.

2.5 Effect of initial Malachite Green dye concentration on decolorization  
The decolorization of MG was studied at various increasing concentration of dye from 1.0 x 10-6M, to 
1.0 x 10-5M and the results presented in Figure 6. It cou ld be inferred from the results that the rate of 
decolorization decreased with the increase in initial MG dye concentration. However, the crude protease enzyme 
was able to decolorize higher concentration in the range of 83 –100% during 24 h incubation perio d. The 
decrease in decolorization efficiency at high concentration might be due to the toxic effect of dye through the 
inhibition of metabolic activities. Similar results were observed by Murugesan et al  [16] who investigated the 
decolorization of reactive  dyes by a thermostable laccase produced by Ganoderma lucidum in solid state culture 
and indicated that decolorization of RB -5 and RBBR dyes decreased with increasing dye concentration.  Enzymatic Decol orization of Malachite Green Dye by a Newly Isolated Bacillus Cereus Strain wwcp1

2.6 Analysis of MG degraded metabolites  
The metabolites produced during the biodegradation of malachite green dye were analyzed by thin 
layer chromatography and the results presented in Figure 7a and 7b. The comparison of TLC chromatograms 
before and after decolorization by crude protease enzyme in iodine chamber showed the appearance of three 
additional bands (M1, M2, and M3 of retardation factor (Rf) values of 0.96, 0.92 and 0.90 respectively (Figure 
7b) as compared to control Rf value of 0.87 wh ich might have been originated from the degraded dye 
metabolites. TLC results suggested that  crude protease enzyme was able to degrade MG dye giving rise to three 
main metabolites  which accounted for color disappearance.

III. Conclusion  
Application of conventional physicochemical waste water treatment requires enormous cost and 
continuous input of chemicals which becomes uneconomical  and causes further environmental damage. In the 
present study, our results clearly demonstrated that crude protease enzyme isolate from Bacillus Cereus Strain 
wwcp1 exhibit a novel alkaline protease properties with ability to decolorize and degrade MG  dye. Taking these 
results into consideration, it can be concluded that newly isolated Bacillus Cereus Strain wwcp1 can be 
exploited for bioremediation of triphenyl methane group of dyes as a cost effective alternative technology for 
dye removal in wastewater treatment processes.
