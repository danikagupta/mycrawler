TechnologiesandMechanisticInsightsofTextileDyeBiodegradation
Textile dyeing processes utilize enormous volumes of potable water and auxiliary chemicals along
withtoxicdyecompounds.Textiledyewastewatersarehazardousmixturesofunusedtextiledyes,
partially degraded dye intermediates (aromatic amines) and several other xenobiotic compounds
which resist biodegradation ( Rathour et al., 2019). If these wastewaters are released untreated
into the
aquatic ecosystems, textile dyes can enter into the food webs, bioaccumulate, disrupt
photosynthesisandexhibitapotentialtoinduceecotoxic,mutagenicandcarcinogeniceﬀects( Lellis
et al., 2019
). The xenobiotic and recalcitrant nature of constituent pollutants in the textile dye
wastewaters makes their treatment extremely challenging. Therefore, it is imperative to devise
eco-sustainable technologies for the remediation of textile dye wastewaters. Recently, various
biological and physico-chemical technologies have been applied for the treatment of textile dye
wastewater with varying eﬃcacies (Deng et al., 2020). Recent research has demonstrated that
microbiotechnolgy

andbacterialprocessesareeﬀectiveintheeco-friendly treatmentoftextiledyewastewaters(Deng
et al., 2020
). Similarly, enzymatic biodegradation of textile dyes by bacterial, fungal, and algal
enzymes such as oxidoreductases, azo reductases, laccases, lignin peroxidases is also considered
as a feasible alternative approach (Mishra and Maiti, 2019). Recent approaches utilizing bacterial
communities (
Rathour et al., 2019), bacterial-bioﬁlm reactors (Rathour et al., 2021) and hybrid
bioelectrochemic

In the study by Mani et al. a new approach was developed
utilizing an enzymatic
biocathode-MFC with Shewanella
oneidensis MR-1 as an anodic biocatalyst for the decolorization
of Acid orange 7 (AO7) dye. In this study, the Trametes
versicolor laccase was immobilized by using three diﬀerent
approaches such as crosslinking with electropolymerized
polyaniline (PANI), entrapment in copper alginate beads
(Cu-Alg), and encapsulation in Naﬁon micelles, in the
absence of redox mediators. Comparative analysis in this
study found that biocathodes with laccase cross-linked with

used recombinant (rlac1338) and mutant laccase (lac2-9) for
decolorization of
various dye compounds. The error-prone PCR
approach was used to induce mutation in rlac1338 and four
mutant enzymes were obtained, among which lac2-9 showed
the highest activity. The observed results suggested that the
expression of mutant enzyme increased by 22 ±2% with an
increase in the speciﬁc enzymatic activity. This study suggested
thattheerror-pronePCRcanbeutilizedinordertoimprovethe

In a research paper, John et al., demonstrated the
decolorization and
degradation potential of halophilic bacterial
strain of Salinivibrio kushneri HTSP for three dyes: Safranin,
Congo red and CBB G-250. The bacterium under experimental
conditions decolorized nearly 80% of CBB G-250 and Congo
red at a wide range of dye concentrations within 48h of
incubation. They observed complete decolorization of Safranin
atlowerconcentration(<150mg/L),howeverthedecolorizationdecreased at higher dye concentrations. Twelve diﬀerent genes
involved in dye degradation were annotated in the genome
sequence of Salinivibrio kushneri HTSP. Authors conclude that,
Salinivibrio kushneri HTSP strain has a potential to be used in
textile dye wastewater treatment, however biotoxicity studies
should be performed before its large-scale application. The
research of Zaveri et al. utilized sodium benzoate as a model
system to simulate
the biodegradation of textile wastewater
pollutants by Pseudomonas citronellolis. The study investigates
how an experimental design approach enabled to understand
the interplay of additional carbon and nitrogen sources as
well as micronutrients on sodium benzoate degradation by
P.citronellolis. This work clearly underlines the importance
of correcting the nutrient balance in order to ensure an
eﬃcient biodegradation of aromatic pollutants present in
textileeﬄuents.

The world today is in a quest for new means of environmental remediation as the
methods currently used are not sufﬁcient to halt the damage. Mostly, a global direction
is headed toward a shift from traditional chemical-based methods to a more ecofriendly
alternative. In this context, biocatalysis is seen as a cost-effective, energy saving, and
clean alternative. It is meant to catalyze degradation of recalcitrant chemicals in an
easy, rapid, green, and sustainable manner. One already established application of
biocatalysis is the removal of dyes from natural water bodies using enzymes, notably
oxidoreductases like laccases, due to their wide range of substrate speciﬁcity. In
order to boost their catalytic activity, various methods of enhancements have been
pursued including immobilization of the enzyme on different support materials. Aside
from increased catalysis, immobilized laccases have the advantages of higher stability,
better durability against harsh environment conditions, longer half-lives, resistance
against protease enzymes, and the ability to be recovered for reuse. This review brieﬂy
outlines the current methods used for detoxiﬁcation and decolorization of dye efﬂuents
stressing on the importance of laccases as a revolutionary biocatalytic solution to this
environmental problem. This work highlights the signiﬁcance of laccase immobilization
and also points out some of the challenges and opportunities of this technology.

INTRODUCTION
Throughout the last century, several industries have inﬂicted a high demand for synthetic dyes.
An estimate of 700,000 tons of diﬀerent synthetic dyes are produced annually (Holkar et al.,
2016; Bilal et al., 2017; Katheresan et al., 2018). Those dyes have stable chemical structures
that make them resistant to degradation by heat, light, or water (Lu et al., 2012a,b; Singh and
Gupta, 2020). Some even form water-soluble complexes that are toxic to human, animal, and
marine life (Bilal et al., 2019). Moreover, hazardous chemicals used in the dye industry, like
corrosive acids, hydrogen peroxide, and caustic soda, are abundantly found in dye wastewater
(Katheresan et al., 2018). Major industries as leather and textile are guilty of discarding

Morsy et al. Decolorization of Dyes by Immobilized Laccases
untreated used dyes in waste water. Other high dye-demanding
ﬁelds, including electroplating, paper, pulp, tannery, plastic,
pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries (Husain, 2010), are
also responsible of causing irreparable damage to the ecosystem
through the way they release their wastes containing dyes into
clean water bodies (Holkar et al., 2016; Katheresan et al., 2018;
Shakerian et al., 2020).
The conventional chemical processes currently used are
eﬀective in dye degradation; nevertheless, they lead to the
production of toxic intermediate products (Bilal et al., 2017,
2019; Rasheed et al., 2019). Consequently, utilizing technologies
that are eﬀective, cheap, and environmentally friendly are being
highly favored by governments and dye manufacturers (Ashraﬁ
et al., 2013; Sharma et al., 2018; Deska and Ko ´nczak, 2019;
Shakerian et al., 2020). Accordingly, biocatalysis is considered
a clean process of dye degradation. Various biocatalysts like
oxidoreductases are used in degrading hazardous compounds,
including phenolic pollutants, and natural or synthetic dye
wastes (Bilal et al., 2018, 2019). Laccase is one widely used
oxidoreductase catalyst of interest due to its catalysis potential
of diﬀerent dyes (Bilal et al., 2019). As a matter of fact, new
sources for fungal and bacterial laccases have been increasingly
demanded to degrade dye eﬄuents, or most commonly known as
dye waste (Dauda and Erkurt, 2020; Jeon and Park, 2020; Joshi
et al., 2020; Singh and Gupta, 2020).
In the past decade, scientists have been working on the
development of novel immobilization methods and support
materials for laccases to improve their performance and
reusability. This improvement is due to the noteworthy
enhancement in pH and thermal stability proﬁle range, as well as
the capability of working under a wider range of environmental
conditions (Dai et al., 2016; Ba and Vinoth Kumar, 2017;
Skoronski et al., 2017; Ali et al., 2020).
The aim of this review is to highlight the recent and distinctive
application of immobilized laccases in the degradation of dyes
in waste water, and how enzyme immobilization enhanced its
biocatalysis activity. Finally, limitations and future opportunities
of using immobilized laccase are discussed.
RECENT DYE REMOVAL METHODS
Dyes are complex unsaturated organic molecules that are able
to absorb light and give color, through reﬂecting the fraction of
light not absorbed by the dye. They are categorized based on
their chromophore structure, particle charge after dissolution,
color index number, and industrial application as summarized
inSupplementary Table 1 (Hunger, 2004; Y agub et al., 2014;
Zhou et al., 2019; Benkhaya et al., 2020). Dyes and metal
ions are the most prevalent detrimental materials found in dye
wastewater that are very harmful to water and soil (Gosavi
and Sharma, 2014; Holkar et al., 2016). Attention has been
drawn lately toward remediation of dye wastewater for reuse,
due to scarcity of clean natural water sources. An eﬀective dye
removal method ideally does its task rapidly, cost eﬀectively, and
without producing secondary contaminants (Rodríguez-Couto
et al., 2009; Katheresan et al., 2018). The current establisheddye removal methods are classiﬁed into three main categories:
physical, oxidation, and biological methods.
Physical
The ﬁrst physical dye removal method is the coagulation
(ﬂocculation) method. This method is mainly used for good
removal of disperse dyes (Liang et al., 2014; Yeap et al., 2014),
but it has the disadvantage of increased generation of sludge
volume (Crini and Lichtfouse, 2019). Another physical method
is adsorption, which has higher eﬃciency in discoloring more
types of dyes than the coagulation method (Jadhav and Srivastava,
2013). It is also considered a cheap method of water remediation
if low cost adsorbents, like polymeric resins and bentonite clay,
are used, but this is not a cost-eﬀective method as the adsorbent
is usually used once, generating sludge, with no chance of
regeneration for future use (Gupta et al., 2011). Third is the
ﬁltration method, where techniques like reverse osmosis and
ultraﬁltration are used to restore the eﬄuent dye for commercial
reuse, but the constant problems of these techniques are the high
cost of ﬁltration membranes and their maintenance (Holkar et al.,
2016; Katheresan et al., 2018).
Oxidation
This is an easily applied method for dye degradation; hence,
it is the most commonly used, starting with advanced
oxidation processes, where they can oxidize a wide range of
chemicals, including organic and inorganic compounds found in
wastewater, but it has the limitation of forming a precipitating
sludge (Babuponnusami and Muthukumar, 2014). Then there
are the chemical oxidation processes that are very powerful
and can break down even the chemical structures of dyes
with double bonds and complex aromatic rings using ozone
(O3) molecules (Asghar et al., 2015). Nevertheless, using these
molecules releases toxic secondary products as well as being
expensive to purchase (Holkar et al., 2016). Finally, there are
the synergistic hybrid advanced oxidation processes. It is a
combination of the two previous methods, which is advised to
be used when synergistic oxidative decolorization eﬀect is desired
(Holkar et al., 2016). However, it still has the disadvantages of the
previous two methods.
Biological
This method is the most preferred nowadays for degrading,
detoxifying, and remediation of recalcitrant dyes from factory
eﬄuents. Its mechanism is based on the adaptability of the
selected microorganisms and the strength of the biological
enzymes either secreted directly from microorganisms or free
enzymes (Solís et al., 2012). Preference of biological methods
over physical and oxidation practices is attributed to their
environmental beneﬁts as there is no production of hazardous
byproducts as well as less sludge formation. Moreover, it is a
cost-eﬀective method, which makes it a better candidate to be
used in industrial scale (Hayat et al., 2015). Up to this point,
many microorganisms and their enzymes have been studied
and tested for their potential ability in degrading dyes found
in wastewater (D’Souza-Ticlo et al., 2009; Wikee et al., 2019).
Apart from the enzyme source, those enzymes degrade dyes

Morsy et al. Decolorization of Dyes by Immobilized Laccases
through biocatalytic oxidation of their chromophores; hence, the
increased interest in studying proprieties of diﬀerent biocatalysts
lately (Chapman et al., 2018). A number of research reports have
documented the high eﬃciency of using enzymes in dye removal
(Chiong et al., 2016; Y ang X. et al., 2016; Katheresan et al., 2018;
Kasheﬁ et al., 2019b).
As promising as using enzymes commercially may seem,
they still have their limitations like low stability and lack
of recovery decreasing their potential for reuse. Also, rapid
loss of catalytic activity may occur in case of altering their
favorable operating conditions. Hence, they usually fail to
perform under harsh industrial conditions. Therefore, new
methods are being developed to enhance the durability of
enzymes through immobilization. This is particularly crucial
when intracellular enzymes are desired to be used in a cell free
system. Nowadays, the usage of enzymes immobilized on solid
carriers is gaining popularity more than the free enzyme, as
immobilization stabilizes the protein structure giving it longer
shelf-life, resistance against proteases, thermal and pH stability,
and repeatability of use, thus, reducing operational cost, which
makes a good candidate for commercial and industrial use
(Dodor et al., 2004; Fernández-Fernández et al., 2013; Nair
et al., 2013; Li et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2015; Bilal et al., 2019;
Deska and Ko ´nczak, 2019).
IMMOBILIZED LACCASE IN REMOVAL
OF DYES
One enzyme of interest that has been around for some time,
is laccase. Scientists have regained interest in it due to its
promising catalytic and physiochemical properties, making it
the perfect candidate for bioremediation processes (Rao et al.,
2014; Legerska et al., 2016). Laccase is a monomeric, dimeric,
or a tetrameric glycoprotein, which oxidizes a broad spectrum
of phenolic and non-phenolic substrates (Giardina et al., 2010).
By now, many laccases have been discovered, and as a family,
they show diﬀerent structures and functions depending on
their source as they can be widely found in eukaryotes as well
as prokaryotes (Deska and Ko ´nczak, 2019); including higher
plants, bacteria, insects, fungi, and recently mammals (Giardina
et al., 2010; Janusz et al., 2020). As for the mechanism of
action of laccases, they catalyze three types of reactions using
oxygen atom and releasing water molecule: (i) direct oxidation
of phenolic substrates, (ii) indirect oxidation of non-phenolic
substrates with high redox potential in the presence of a
natural or synthetic low molecular weight mediator (Breen
and Singleton, 1999; Agrawal et al., 2018), and (iii) coupling
reactions with reactive intermediate radicals formed during
direct oxidation (Polak and Jarosz-Wilkolazka, 2012). The active
site of laccases, where biocatalysis occurs, has three copper
centers/types/domains; (1) blue copper center (type I), (2) normal
copper center (type II), and (3) coupled binuclear copper centers
(type 3) (Messerschmidt and Huber, 1990; Solomon et al., 1992;
Dwivedi et al., 2011).
A great number of research articles have reported the
increased biocatalytic performance of laccase for a longer stretchof time when immobilized. As a general deﬁnition, to immobilize
an enzyme is when the soluble form of the enzyme is attached
to a solid support or, most recently, through formation of
aggregates. In this context, diﬀerent ways of immobilization
include adsorption on beads or a matrix, covalent binding
to a solid support, entrapment or encapsulation in polymers,
and crosslinking as illustrated in Supplementary Figure 1
(Shrivastava et al., 2012; Datta et al., 2013; Sirisha et al.,
2016). Whichever method is chosen, one point ought to be
taken into consideration: no immobilization method should
inﬂuence the enzymatic conformation so that the activity shall
not be aﬀected (Shaheen et al., 2017). Other factors to bear in
mind while considering the diﬀerent immobilization methods
shall be more elaborated in Supplementary Data 1. A simple
proposed mechanism of dye degradation by immobilized laccase
is illustrated in Figure 1 with the aid of the crystal structure of
laccase from Thermus thermophilus HB27 (PDB code: 5JRR). In
the ﬁgure, the dye structure, substrate, is being oxidized by only
oxygen in the presence of laccase as a catalyst. When the dye is
oxidized, it loses an electron that moves from one Cu2Catom to
another inside the catalytic site, until it eventually reduces oxygen
to release water. More information about laccase-catalyzed
descoloration of dyes and the exact oxidized products have
been reported in literature (Zille et al., 2005; Y ang et al., 2015;
Kagalkar et al., 2015).
Immobilized laccases proved to be worthy challengers for
the eﬀective decolorization, degradation, and removal of dyes
(Bilal et al., 2019). For example, laccase from the Cerrena sp.
strain HYB07 was immobilized by preparing cross-linked enzyme
aggregates (CLEAs) of the enzyme to degrade Remazol Brilliant
Blue Reactive dye. Almost 90% of the dye was eliminated from
the solution in just 40 min without the help of a redox mediator
(Y ang J. et al., 2016). In another study, Arica et al. (2017)
demonstrated the immobilization of laccase on ﬁbrous polymer-
grafted polypropylene chloride ﬁlm, where three dyes, namely,
Procion Green H4G, Brilliant Blue G, and Crystal Violet, were
tested for removal by both the free and immobilized enzyme. The
immobilized laccase gave better dye degradation results than the
free one (Arica et al., 2017).
In addition to the improved biocatalytic properties,
immobilized laccase shows notable storage stability and
repeated use capability, while maintaining satisfactory eﬃciency
(Deska and Ko ´nczak, 2019). In a study, by Ma et al. (2018),
genipin-activated chitosan beads were introduced as a highly
stable laccase biocatalyst from Trametes pubescens. The resulting
immobilized laccase reached to a decolorization of 77.49% of
Acid Black 172 dye. Moreover, the carrier-supported laccase
displayed excellent reuse potential with >55% of remaining
activity reserved after 11 cycles of constant use. It also showed
high storage stability retaining over 57.14% of its original activity
after 30 days of storage at 4C (Ma et al., 2018).
Also, increased pH stability is a notable characteristic of the
immobilized laccase as stated by Wen et al. (2019), when the
enzyme was physically adsorbed on kaolinite for the removal
of malachite green dye. The immobilized biocatalyst exhibited
outstanding stability over a broad pH range from 3 to 6, with
the lowest relative activity being 60% at pH 5.5 and the highest

is 100% at pH 4.5. The authors justiﬁed this enhanced pH
tolerance to a relative stable proton production on the surface
of support and assured that it could retain the activity of laccase
(Wen et al., 2019).
Furthermore, immobilized catalysts often show remarkable
improved thermal steadiness than free enzymes. A recent report
presented a novel support carrier; laccase covalently bound
to crosslinked graphene oxide–zeolite nanocomposites. The
obtained catalytic system was exploited for the degradation
of Direct Red 23 dye. Notably, the immobilized laccase
was very stable at 80C and preserved 84% of its initial
catalytic activity, unlike its free counterpart, which could only
retain 18%. The author attributed this thermal protection to
the covalent bonding between laccase and supporting carrier
(Mahmoodi and Saﬀar-Dastgerdi, 2020).Many literature reports conﬁrm that using immobilized
laccases is a favorable technology in the treatment of dye
eﬄuents. Several recent reports regarding this matter are listed
inTable 1.
LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE
OPPORTUNITIES
As narrated throughout this minireview, the current established
dye treatment methodologies still have, to some extent,
several limitations. The fact that no certain decolorization
method is adopted universally for all types of dye eﬄuents
needs more study, as currently, using a single dye removal
method, either physical, oxidation, or biological, is not enough.

Using a combination of diﬀerent methods may be attributed
to the complex and diﬀerent chromophore structures of
dying compounds. It is undeniable that the current enzyme
immobilization methods are very useful and somehow eﬀective
in the issue at hand: decolorization and detoxiﬁcation of dye
wastewater. However, as auspicious as immobilized enzymes
seem to be, the matter of loss of activity or stability should be
addressed. Limitations of current immobilization methods are
due to enzyme leakage from carrier, undesired reactions between
carrier and enzyme or even the inability of the enzyme to react
with its substrate. Nowadays, scientists are still developing new
enzyme immobilization methods as it is a promising ﬁeld that
gives both better results and cost eﬀectiveness for industrial use.
However, from what is evident from recent research reports,
they are merely focused on ﬁnding new materials, but theprinciples and methodologies of enzyme immobilization are
still unchanged.
Despite the success of most of the reported laccase
immobilization methods in dye removal, there is still one
more aspect to be investigated when assessing their eﬃciency.
The chemical structure of the target dye aﬀects the results
dramatically. Research reports often published assess the
eﬃciency of their technologies by testing them on dyes with
simple, low molecular weight structures that eventually show
high decolorization results. Also, those promising technologies
are still not implemented on an industrial scale. As the industrial
sectors always seek the most economical technologies, they prefer
using large quantities of mixed crude cultures or pure cultures
over the immobilized one to limit the costs, overlooking the long-
term advantages of reusage of immobilized enzymes. Most are

Morsy et al. Decolorization of Dyes by Immobilized Laccases
drawn toward fungal more than bacterial laccase, due to its higher
redox potential that show a higher oxidative ability. However,
bacterial laccases are reported to withstand the harsh industrial
environments with higher temperatures and pH values than those
tolerated by fungal laccases. It is advised to use a redox mediator
to act as an electron shuttle for better decolorization results of dye
structures with higher redox potentials.
For all the mentioned drawbacks, immobilized laccases
represent a potential eﬀective, eco-friendly and commercial
alternative to the physical, chemical, and oxidative dye
decolorization methods. The scientiﬁc and industrial
communities have real chances and future opportunities to
moderate the current situation. Improvements can be made in
ﬁelds of developing novel immobilization strategies in order
to avoid enzyme leakage and come up with a more stable,
durable, sustainable, and economical immobilization systems.
One solution to the problem is the immobilization of both
enzyme and redox mediator on the same carrier. This method
ensures that low and medium redox potential laccases have better
eﬃciency and operational stability. Also, this co-immobilized
system can be reused several times, which will eventually reduce
the manufacturing cost, that is ultimately the main concern of the
industrial sector. This ambitious suggestion shall introduce an
environmentally conscious and cost-eﬀective dye detoxiﬁcation
method to the market.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS

Synthetic dyes, extensively used in various industries, act as pollutants in the aquatic 
environment, and pose a significant threat to living beings. In the present study, we assessed the potential of a halophilic bacterium Salinivibrio kushneri HTSP isolated from a saltpan 
for decolorization and bioremediation of synthetic dyes. The genomic assessment of this strain revealed the presence of genes encoding the enzymes involved in decolorization mechanisms including FMN-dependent NADH azoreductase Clade III, which cleave the azo bond of the dye, and the enzymes involved in deamination and isomerization of intermediate compounds. The dye decolorization assay was performed using this bacterial strain on three water-soluble dyes in different concentrations: Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB) G-250 (500–3,000 mg/L), Safranin, and Congo red (50–800 mg/L). Within 48 h, more than 80% of decolorization was observed in all tested concentrations of CBB G-250 and Congo red dyes. The rate of decolorization was the highest for Congo red followed by CBB G-250 and then Safranin. Using UV-Visible spectrometer and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) analysis, peaks were observed in the colored and decolorized solutions. The results indicated a breakdown of dyes upon decolorization, as some peaks were shifted and lost for different vibrations of aromatic rings, aliphatic groups (–CH
2, –CH 3) and 
functional groups (–NH, –SO 3H, and –SO 3−) in decolorized solutions. This study has shown 
the potential of S. kushneri HTSP to decolorize dyes in higher concentrations at a faster 
pace than previously reported bacterial strains. Thus, we propose that our isolated strain can be utilized as a potential dye decolorizer and biodegradative for wastewater treatment.

INTRODUCTION
Dyes are organic coloring agents which are extensively used for coloring the products in 
various industries including textile, paper, cosmetic, and food ( Vaghela et  al., 2005). These 
coloring agents are complex aromatic structures which remain stable by resisting the impacts of temperature and other environmental factors ( Pandey et  al., 2007 ). Overall, more than 
15John et al.  Bio-Decolorization of Synthetic DyesFrontiers in Microbiology  | www.frontiersin.org  2 December 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 594011thousands of dyes are generated commercially and 7  ×  105 
metric tons of dyes are produced annually ( Amoozegar et  al., 
2011). Generally, based on their origin, the dyes are classified 
into natural and synthetic dyes. Natural dyes are obtained directly from plants, microbes, insects, and animals ( Shahid 
et  al., 2013). Although natural dyes are eco-friendly and biodegradable, they are unstable (Y amjala et  al., 2016). On the other hand, synthetic dyes produced in controlled laboratory conditions show greater stability than natural dyes. Globally, the textile industry utilizes the highest proportion of dyes ( Fang 
et al., 2004), which are often toxic to living beings and difficult to degrade (Fu and Viraraghavan, 2001). Upon coloring the fabrics, 10–15% of used dyes, fibers, and other components generally get discharged into the aquatic ecosystem (Chen et  al., 2003). The dyes in the aquatic environment pose a major threat to the inhabitants ( Sandhya et  al., 2008 ). The 
presence of dyes inhibits photosynthetic activity and oxygen solubility at deeper layers of the water body by reducing the light penetration (Saratale et al., 2009). The dyes form a source of aromatic amines upon degradation, which, in turn, are considered as mutagenic, toxic, and carcinogenic, posing threats to living beings (Robinson et  al., 2001; Ayed et  al., 2011). 
Considering these detrimental effects of dye on the environment, safe disposal and successful decolorization of dyes becomes the utmost priority.
For dye decolorization and degradation, several methods 
such as coagulation/adsorption, electrolysis, ozonation, chemical oxidation, and ultrafiltration have generally been used ( Zhang 
et  al., 2004; Zhu et  al., 2004). However, these methods have 
limited applicability due to their inefficiency, higher budget, and toxic intermediates (Verma et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2004). 
The municipal sewage systems are not adequate to decolorize the water discharge efficiently due to the complex nature of pollutants and residuals from the by-products ( Champagne 
and Ramsay, 2010 ). Hence, the biological degradation of dyes 
involving microbes is considered as one of the best methods (O’neill et  al., 2000 ). This has been proven as a cost-effective 
and eco-friendly method that generates a significantly lesser amount of intermediate toxic compounds ( Robinson et  al., 
2001; Chen et  al., 2003). Biological methods include dye 
degradation by metabolic pathways, absorption, and accumulation by bacteria, fungi, yeast, and algae ( Solís et  al., 2012). Several 
studies have reported that bacterial strains possessing genes for azoreductase, laccase, and peroxidase, which act on the amine and aromatic structure of dye, make them suitable candidates for dye degradation (Chen et  al., 2003; Babu et  al., 
2015). Several bacterial strains including Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria had been reported to show the dye decolorization ability, for example, Bacillus subtilus  and 
Aeromonas hydrophila  (Wuhrmann et al., 1980 ); Proteus mirabilis  
and Pseudomonas  sp. ( Saratale et  al., 2011); Shewanella  sp.; 
and other bacterial consortia (Moosvi et  al., 2005).
Major challenges in bacterial dye degradation in the 
wastewaters include high salt concentration, various metals, and complex nature of wastes. Hence, most of the bacteria, though have shown a promise in the early experiments, fail to work efficiently at a larger scale ( Mellado and Ventosa, 2003 ). In recent years, halophilic bacterial strains have shown promise in dye decolorization ( Amoozegar et  al., 2011 ). With the 
potential to degrade dye, they can grow in a wide range of salinity, temperature, pH, and elevated heavy metal concentrations (Margesin and Schinner, 2001; 
John et  al., 2020).
In the present study, we  have assessed the dye degradation 
potential of a halophilic bacterial strain Salinivibrio kushneri  
HTSP isolated from Marakkanam saltpan, Tamil Nadu, India. This saltpan is characterized by a large seasonal fluctuation of salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and elevated levels of several heavy metals ( John et  al., 2019, 2020). Previous studies 
on this halophilic bacterium, S. kushneri  HTSP (Proteobacteria, 
Gamma-proteobacteria, Vibrionales, and Vibrionaceae), revealed its ability to grow in a wide salinity range of 15–210  ppt and pH range of 5–10, and it has tolerance to heavy metals including Cu, Zn, Co, Hg, Cr, Pb, and As ( John et al., 2019). The analysis 
of whole-genome sequencing showed the presence of genes conferring resistance/tolerance to heavy metals and UV radiation, as well as those responsible for hydrocarbon degradation, by producing various enzymes, thus indicating the bioremediation potential of this bacterium in various industries and ecosystems (John et  al., 2019). Though this species shows potential in dye 
decolorization, no studies have been attempted to prove this claim. Hence, to address this knowledge gap, we  studied bio-decolorization of three dyes belonging to different classes using the S. kushneri  HTSP strain: (i) Coomassie brilliant blue 
(CBB) G-250, a triphenylmethane dye commonly used in the textile industry and molecular biology laboratories ( Rayaroth 
et  al., 2015;  Abbas et  al., 2016 ); (ii) Safranin O, a quinone 
imine dye commonly used as a biological stain in the laboratories (Drabik et  al., 2010;  Sabnis, 2010); and (iii) Congo red, an 
azo dye, a known carcinogen, widely used in the paper, textile and other industries (Babu et  al., 2013).
Industrialization is increasing at a faster pace and causing 
the rise of environmental pollution by producing millions of different chemicals including hydrocarbons, herbicides, pesticides toxic metals, and different dyes as either direct products or by-products (Amoozegar et  al., 2011). Synthetic dyes and toxic structures of the dye-containing effluents pose a serious threat to aquatic life forms by causing toxicity to them (Georgiou et  al., 2004;  Supaka et  al., 2004 ). Biological dye decolorization 
has been advocated as one of the most suitable methods to treat waste materials before discharge ( Stolz, 2001). In this 
regard, we assessed the suitability of halophilic bacteria S. kushneri  
HTSP isolated from Marakkanam saltpan for decolorization of synthetic dyes. We  analyzed the rate of bacterial decolorization of dyes using UV-Vis spectrophotometer and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. We also performed in silico  analysis 
to identify genes involved in dye decolorization in the previously reported S. kushneri  HTSP genome.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Dyes and Chemicals
Three dyes were used for dye decolorization experiments: 
Safranin, Congo red, and CBB G-250. All the dyes used in 
16John et al.  Bio-Decolorization of Synthetic DyesFrontiers in Microbiology  | www.frontiersin.org  3 December 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 594011this study were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (United States). 
Different concentrations were used for decolorization experiments and the desired concentrations were selected based on preliminary screening from 50 to 5,000 mg/L. For conducting the experiments, 500–3,000 and 50–800  mg/L was selected for CBB G-250, Congo red, and Safranin, respectively. All the dye solutions were prepared in filter-sterilized (0.2  μm) dye decolorization 
broth for avoiding nutrient loss. The working solutions were prepared using sterilized decolorization media for compensating the nutrient loss.
Microorganisms and Inoculum Preparation
Salinivibrio kushneri  HTSP isolated from the Marakkanam 
salt pan (12.13° 02° N; 79.58° 12° E) was previously identified 
through a polyphasic taxonomic approach including morphological, biochemical, and molecular analysis ( John 
et  al., 2019). For the present study, the culture was revived from a stock kept in 80% glycerol at − 80°C. These were 
transferred on to a fresh nutrient agar plate prepared in the source seawater (120  ppt). The culture conditions including optimum salinity, temperature, pH, and days of incubation were standardized. The bacterial strain was inoculated under aerobic conditions onto nutrient broth as well as agar with different ranges of salinity, from 15 to 60  ppt, and incubated at 27–37° C for 12  h to 2  days. The required salinity was 
obtained by mixing the source seawater (200 ppt) with sterilized Milli Q water.
One loopful of overnight-grown culture was inoculated into 
the decolorization broth (5-g glucose, 2.5-g yeast extract, and 2.5-g NaCl in a final volume of 500  ml) and incubated in a shaker incubator (aerobic) at 37 °C for 6  h. After 6  h (log 
phase of bacterial growth), the cells were harvested by a quick centrifuge at 3,000  rpm for 5  min. The bacterial cells were resuspended in 0.8% NaCl, and the optical density at 600  nm was adjusted to ~0.6–0.8 (6 × 10
8 cells/ml). The cell suspensions 
were used for further analysis.
Decolorization Experiment
Two hundred microliters of the bacterial cell suspension were inoculated onto different concentrations of different dyes (for 20  ml) and the tubes were incubated at 37 °C for 48  h against 
a negative control, which contained only the dye in respective concentrations without the inoculum. The solution was withdrawn at an interval of 4  h for CBB G-250 and 6  h for Congo red and Safranin. The absorbance of the decolorized media solution (blank) was measured at 580 nm (CBB G-250), 490 nm (Congo red), and 530  nm (Safranin), respectively, using UV-Vis spectrophotometer against a blank of decolorization media without dye. The solution was centrifuged at 12,000  rpm for 1 min before taking the absorbance for removing any suspended precipitates. All the experiments were performed in triplicates. The trial experiment was also conducted with a higher volume (250  ml) and the same result was obtained. For the qualitative and quantitative analysis, the experiment was performed in 20  ml volume.
Decolorization percentage was calculated using the formula:

Biodegradation Assay
The dye degradation was further confirmed through spectral 
analysis of UV-Vis spectroscopy and FTIR spectroscopy.
UV-Visible Spectroscopy
For the UV-Vis spectral analysis of dye decolorization, the decolorized solution was scanned (200–1,000  nm) against a dye control and the peaks were cross-matched using a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-1800). The highest concentration of dye which was completely decolorized was chosen for this analysis against a dye control. The peaks obtained before and after decolorization were analyzed (Ali et  al., 2009;  Ayed et  al., 2011).
Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
The functional groups of the degraded dyes were analyzed with FTIR spectroscopy. The biodegraded dye was collected after the experiment and the bacterial suspension was removed by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 5 min. The resulting supernatant solution was lyophilized and used for FTIR analysis. The highest concentration at which the dyes were completely decolorized was used as a test sample for FTIR analysis and the dyes in powder form were used as control. The mid-IR spectra of degraded dyes were obtained in the FTIR spectrophotometer by Shimadzu, IR Infinity 1. The degraded dye sample was prepared by mixing 1 weight % of dye with 99 weight % of KBr and the mixture was ground well to make a paste of uniform consistency. The sample matrix was loaded in a 7-mm Pellet Die of 7-mm Disc Holder Mount and pressed in 2  T Mini-Pellet Press (Specac Ltd.). The sample mixture was then analyzed using the instrument by mounting the sample on the sample holder using the ring holder and the transmittance scanned from the range of 4,000–400  cm
−1 with a resolution 
of 1  cm−1 set for 20 scans per min ( Babu et  al., 2013). The 
obtained peaks were compared with the published reference dye peaks ( Sigma-Aldrich, n.d. ; Sun et al., 2013 ; Maity et al., 2015 ; 
Sahu and Patel, 2015;  Asses et  al., 2018).
In silico Analysis of Salinivibrio kushneri 
HTSP Dye-Decolorizing
The genome of S. kushneri  HTSP was retrieved from the NCBI 
genome database ( John et  al., 2019, NCBI genome accession 
no. PXUD00000000) for analyzing dye-decolorizing genes. The 
genome was subjected to automatic annotation on the Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology webserver ( Overbeek 
et  al., 2014). The annotated genome was visually searched to identify the target genes, and a BLAST search was performed using the annotated genome against well-studied genes.
Azoreductase Clade III, a well-known decolorizing enzyme, 
was identified in the genome and compared with other bacterial species through phylogenetic analysis. The phylogenetic tree was constructed based on an amino acid sequence from the best BLASTp hits along with previously reported sequences

FIGURE 1  | Phylogenetic tree of azoreductase based on amino acid sequences. Amino acid sequences for nitror eductase is used as an outgroup.(Kumaran et  al., 2020 ). Pairwise and multiple sequence  
alignment was performed using the CLUSTAL W program 
and phylogeny was constructed using the Neighbor-Joining (NJ) method in MEGA (v 7.0, Kumar et al., 2016). Multispecies nitroreductase family protein of Bacilli  (NCBI GenBank accession: 
WP_002358386) was used as an outgroup in the phylogenetic tree.
Statistical Analysis
All the data from dye decolorization assays were tested for statistical significance by comparing the mean of different test conditions using One-way ANOV A with the Tukey Scheffe alpha multiple comparison test. The data were checked for the normality by visual inspection and homogeneity of variance by Levene’s test. The data were considered significant if p < 0.05. 
The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS [V . 22, IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Armonk, NY (SPSS, 2013)].
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In silico Analysis for Dye Decolorization 
Genes
A total of 12 genes involved in the dye decolorization pathway 
were identified. These include genes encoding FMN-dependent NADH azoreductase Clade III, hydroxymuconate delta isomerase, maleylacetoacetate isomerase, cytidine deaminase, cytosine deaminase, ornithine cyclodeaminase, deoxycytidine triphosphate deaminase, tRNA-specific adenosine-34 deaminase, diamino hydroxyl phosphoribosyl amino pyrimidine deaminase, glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase, adenosine deaminase, and porphobilinogen deaminase.To ascertain the identity of the FMN-dependent NADPH 
azoreductase Clade III, the first enzyme in the decolorizing pathway (Dave et  al., 2015), the amino acid sequence of the gene was compared with previously reported sequences through BLAST and NJ-based phylogeny. The phylogenetic reconstruction revealed that azoreductase of S. kushneri  HTSP forms a separate 
clade supported by high bootstrap confidence (Figure  1).
The genomic assessment of this strain revealed the presence 
of genes involved in various mechanisms of dye decolorization, for example, the FMN-dependent NADH azoreductase is involved in cleaving the azo bonds of the dye and converting the dye into aromatic amines ( Dave et al., 2015 ). The resultant 
aromatic amines and other functional groups would be further cleaved or reduced by genes involved in deamination and isomerization processes. Based on the genes found in the genome, we  have predicted a dye decolorization pathway (Figure  2). However further analysis like NMR; GC/LC-MS 
is needed for the confirmation of formed intermediates. AZO reductase, a primary enzyme in the decolorization process, was compared with other known sequences from different bacterial strains. Though the sequences from the genus Salinivibrio  including S. kushneri  HTSP formed a separate clade 
in the phylogenetic tree, it was comparatively closer to clade III azoreductase than other classes (I, II, and IV) of azoreductases (Suzuki, 2019 ; Kumaran et  al., 2020). Class III azoreductase 
is a flavin-dependent enzyme with a significant difference in substrate specificities (Bafana and Chakrabarti, 2008;  Misal 
and Gawai, 2018). In general, azo, nitro compounds, and quinone are a better substrate for class III azoreductase ( Liu 
et al., 2008;  Suzuki, 2019) such as Congo red (Y ang et al., 2011; 
Gao et al., 2015 ), dyes with methyl groups ( Eslami et al., 2016 ). 
18John et al.  Bio-Decolorization of Synthetic DyesFrontiers in Microbiology  | www.frontiersin.org  5 December 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 594011Hence, it can be assumed that S. kushneri  HTSP uses azoreductase 
to decolorize Congo red, Safranin (a dye with methyl group), 
and CBB G-250, indicating its potential for dye decolorization. The ability of different bacterial strains to decolorize different classes of dyes through the action of azoreductase has been reported earlier (Eichlerová et  al., 2006 ; Amoozegar et  al., 
2011 ). For example, Halomonas elongate , a halophilic bacterium, 
is reported to decolorize mono and di azo dyes including methyl red, remazol black, and sulphonyl blue TLE ( Eslami 
et  al., 2016;  Cao et  al., 2017). Further, to ascertain our claim 
based on genomic analysis that the isolated strain can achieve dye decolorization, we  performed decolorization assays on three dyes Congo red, Safranin, and CBB G-250 and analyzed using analytical methods of UV-Vis spectrophotometer and FTIR spectrometer, which is considered a gold standard for decolorization studies (Chen et  al., 2008).
Dye Decolorization by Salinivibrio kushneri 
HTSP
The bacterial strain showed a luxuriant growth on a 60  ppt 
solid plate after overnight incubation at room temperature (~29°C) with a pH of 7.4, and in the broth, it took 6  h to reach an optical density of 0.8–1 at 600 nm. Hence, decolorization assays were performed in 60  ppt salinity conditions. Single-factor analysis on ANOV A after complete decolorization of each dye at same time point showed the rate of decolorization between the different concentrations of dyes was statistically significant (p  <  0.05). Salinivibrio kushneri  HTSP significantly decolorized CBB G-250 dye for all concentrations within 48  h (Figure  3A). The percentage of decolorization was slow in the initial period of incubation and by 48  h almost 90% of the dye at all tested concentrations were completely decolorized. Within 48  h, 96  ±  0.00, 88  ±  0.00, 85  ±  0.00, 82  ±  0.02, and 73  ±  0.00% dye was decolorized in 500, 800, 1,000, 2,000, and 3,000  mg/L dye, respectively (Figure  3A).
For Congo red dye decolorization, a significant color reduction 
was observed within 36  h of incubation. At 24  h, 92  ±  0.00% dye was decolorized in 50  ppm and for 150, 300, 600, and 800  ppm the decolorization percentage was found to be 88 ± 0.00, 78 ± 0.01, 80 ± 0.02, and 69 ± 0.00%, respectively. After 36  h, more than 90% of dye was decolorized in all concentrations (Figure  3B).
Salinivibrio kushneri  HTSP decolorized Safranin completely 
in the lower concentration of 50 and 150  mg/L within 48  h. However, with increasing dye concentration, the rate of decolorization decreased. A low level of decolorization, such as 79  ±  0.02% for 300  mg/L, 25  ±  0.00% for 600  mg/L, and 22  ±  0.00 for 800  mg/L was obtained after 48  h ( Figure  3C).
Characterization of Samples After 
Degradation
Shifts in the peaks were observed under UV-Vis spectroscopy 
between the test decolorized samples and the control. For CBB G-250, only one peak was observed in the control (at 585 nm) and three peaks were observed in the test decolorized sample. For Congo red, three different peaks were observed in the

19John et al.  Bio-Decolorization of Synthetic DyesFrontiers in Microbiology  | www.frontiersin.org  6 December 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 594011control, while only one peak after decolorization. For Safranin, 
four peaks were observed in both the control and the decolorized sample. However, the absorption wavelengths were different before and after decolorization: Peaks were observed at 888, 829, 810, and 505  nm before decolorization and 927, 732, 596, and 306  nm after decolorization (Figure  4).Further, various peaks were obtained in FTIR analysis of 
all three dyes corresponding to different vibrations of aromatic rings, aliphatic groups (–CH
2, –CH 3), and functional groups 
(–NH, –SO 3H, and –SO 3−). There were considerable variations 
observed in the functional groups before and after dye decolorization. For Congo red, 12 absorption peaks were observed before decolorization; however, no relevant peak was observed after decolorization (Figure  5A). For CBB G-250, 33 peaks were observed in the colored solution, while the number of peaks reduced to 30 after decolorization. The peaks spanned in the range of 422–3,200  nm wavelength with a majority between 1,000 and 2,000  nm. However, peaks were not the same between colorized and decolorized solution, except for one at 454  nm (Figure  5B). For Safranin, 25 peaks in color solution and 24 peaks in decolorized solutions were observed. However, colored solution peaks were in the range of 3,400–4,000 nm, and decolorized solution peaks in the range of 600–3,600  nm ( Figure  5C). We  used smoothened data for 
plotting the graph.
The functional group analysis using FTIR and peak analysis 
using UV-Vis spectroscopy before and after 36 h of decolorization of CBB G-250 (2,000  mg/L), Safranin (150  mg/L), and Congo red (800  mg/L) supported our predicted mechanism shown in Figure  2. In general, the peaks which are responsible for 
several different bonds and functional groups cleavage were identified and matched. The major peaks corresponded with cleavage of N=N bonds, cleavage of aromatic rings, OH releasing, conversion of SO
3− to –OH groups, cleavage of C=C and C=H 
bonding, and cleavage of alkane group. On the contrary, after decolorization, the majority of the peaks were identified as hydroxy groups (–OH; Maity et  al., 2015).
There were no significant peaks were observed after 
decolorization for Congo red. For Congo red dye ( Figure  5A), 
observed peaks were identified as N–H stretching (3,468 cm
−1), 
C–O stretching (1,226–1,179 cm−1), S=O stretching (1,059 cm−1), 
and several unknown peaks found in the control sample were absent in the test conditions ( Babu et  al., 2013 ; Sun et  al., 
2013; Asses et  al., 2018 ). For CBB G-250, the peaks in the 
range of 1,397–1,585 nm that corresponded with aromatic rings observed in the colored solution were mostly absent in the

C=C (985–618  cm−1) bending, CH bending (985–618  cm−1), 
and alkane groups (2,291–2,974  cm−1) were observed in the 
colored solution but not in the decolorized solution, as shown 
in Figure 5B (Maity et al., 2015; Paz et al., 2017). For Safranin, 
the absorbance peaks observed were mainly aliphatic primary amine N–H stretching (3,000–3,560  cm
−1) and –OH stretching 
in the range of 3,589–4,000 nm in the control sample. However, in the decolorized test sample, the absorbance peaks varied: C–L stretching at 625  nm, C–N stretching 1,042–1,626  nm, C–C stretching 1,626  nm, C–H stretching 2,853–3,243  nm, and –OH stretching 3,283–3,564  nm ( Babu et  al., 2015 ; Sahu 
and Patel, 2015). The shift in the peaks suggests a breakdown of functional groups that may have changed the original structure of the dyes in the decolorized test samples ( Chen et  al., 2008; 
Ali et  al., 2009).
Our results clearly indicate that S. kushneri  HTSP could 
decolorize up to 3,000 mg/L CBB G-250; 300 mg/L for Safranin; and 800  mg/L for Congo red, which is significantly a higher concentration than previously reported. For example, Paz et  al. 
(2017) showed that Bacillus aryabhattai  could decolorize CBB 
G-250 up to 150  mg/L; Babu et  al. (2013)  showed that Dietzia  
sp. decolorized Congo red up to 100  mg/L. In addition, the time for decolorization was also found to be  significantly less for S. kushneri  HTSP than previously reported. Our results have 
shown that S. kushneri  HTSP could decolorize a higher 
concentration of dyes at even a faster rate than previously reported halophilic bacteria such as Shewanella putrefacians  and 
Halomonas  sp. ( Amoozegar et al., 2011 ; Gao et al., 2015 ). Previous 
studies on other bacteria also have reported a higher average time to decolorize the dyes used in this study even in comparatively lower concentrations (Babu et  al., 2013;  Paz et  al., 2017).
CONCLUSION
Earlier studies have shown that S. kushneri  HTSP has proven 
capacity to grow in a wide range of salinity, as well as the ability to tolerate/resist heavy metals and UV radiation (John et  al., 2019 ), and now we  report that this strain has 
capability to decolorize dyes in the higher concentration at a relatively faster rate. Thus, we  argue that it can be  potentially utilized for dye decolorization in wastewater treatment. However, further studies including cytotoxicity assays are to be conducted before using this strain at the industrial scales.

Enzymatic biocathodes have the potential to replace platinum as an expensive catalyst
for the oxygen reduction reaction in microbial fuel cells (MFCs). However, enzymes are
fragileandpronetolossofactivitywithtime.Thiscouldbecircumventedbyusingsuitable
immobilizationtechniquestomaintaintheactivityandincreaselongevityoftheenzyme.In
thepresentstudy,laccasefrom Trametesversicolor wasimmobilizedusingthreedifferent
approaches, i.e., crosslinking with electropolymerized polyaniline (PANI), entrapment
in copper alginate beads (Cu-Alg), and encapsulation in Naﬁon micelles (Naﬁon), in
the absence of redox mediators. These laccase systems were employed in cathode
chambers of MFCs for decolourization of Acid orange 7 (AO7) dye. The biocatalyst in
the anode chamber was Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 in each case. The enzyme in
the immobilized states was compared with freely suspended enzyme with respect to
dye decolourization at the cathode, enzyme activity retention, power production, and
reusability. PANI laccase showed the highest stability and activity, producing a power
density of 38 ±1.7 mWm−2comparedto25.6 ±2.1 mWm−2for Naﬁon laccase,14.7
±1.04 mW m−2for Cu-Alg laccase, and 28 ±0.98 mW m−2for the freely suspended
enzyme. There was 81% enzyme activity retained after 1 cycle (5 days) for PANI laccase
compared to 69% for Naﬁon and 61.5% activity for Cu-alginate laccase and 23.8%
activity retention for the freely suspended laccase compared to initial activity. The dye

INTRODUCTION
Microbial Fuel cells (MFCs) have been extensively explored for treatment of dye containing
wastewaterandconcomitantenergyproduction(Gomaaetal.,2017;Huangetal.,2017;Sonuetal.,
2020).T
here are several studies reporting the use of enzymes and their fungal sources in MFCs
for dye decolourization (Simões et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2020). Laccase is one such enzyme used in
24Mani et al. Immobilized Laccase for Dye Decolourization in MFC
the textile industry for bleaching and in fuel cells for catalyzing
the oxygen
reduction reaction. Laccase is a multi-copper
containing oxidase enzyme which is capable of one electron
oxidationofothersubstratesandfourelectronreductionofO 2to
H2O (Galhaup and Haltrich, 2001). Laccase has been employed
in the
cathode chamber of MFC for dye decolourization and
catalysis of the oxygen reduction reaction (Savizi et al., 2012;
Manietal.,
2019).
Theuseof
enzymaticcathodesishowever,limitedbytheshort
lifetime and stability of the enzymes in MFC systems due to
factors such as pH gradients, salinity increases etc (Mani et al.,
2017). T
hese limitations could be overcome by immobilizing
the enzymes
to improve stability. Enzymes in the immobilized
form are stable and resistant to environmental factors and the
enzymes can be reused. When laccase was electropolymerized
(120U mg−1of chitosan) on an electrode with chitosan and
methylene blue and utilized in a MFC for dye decolourization,
the MFC produced a maximum power density of 58.8 mWm−2
andadecolourizationeﬃciencyof74%forReactiveBlue221dye
after 120h (Savizi et al., 2012). The diﬀerent types of enzyme
immobilizationandt
heiradvantagesanddisadvantagesarelisted
inTable1.
Immobilizing enzymes on electrodes was found to provide
direct electron transfer and higher power output in enzymatic
biofuel cells (Cooney et al., 2008). Conducting polymers like
PolyAniline(P
ANI)canformanadhesivepolymeronelectrodes
and conduct electrons (Tiwari et al., 2007). Another method of
immobilizing enzymes
is entrapment of the enzyme in beads.
Laccase is a copper-dependent enzyme and immobilizing in
copper alginate beads could retain more activity compared to
other methods. Teerapatsakul and group have observed that
the immobilization yield and enzyme activity was higher when
CuSO4was used as crosslinking solution compared to CaCl 2
(Teerapatsakuletal.,2008).
Athird met
hod of immobilization involves encapsulation
of laccase in Naﬁon polymer micelles formed by modifying
the polymer with an alkyl ammonium salt such as
tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) (Meredith et al.,
2012). T
he quaternary ammonium cations modify the
Naﬁon to
less acidic form by replacing the protons and
counteracting the sulfonate groups. They also increase the
size of micelles and channels which should result in favorable
enzymeimmobilization.
Platinum is the most commonly used cathode catalyst for
high performance fuel cells. In recent years, because of the high
cost of platinum, there has been a transition to PGM (Platinum
GroupMetals)freecatalystsforoxygenreductionreactionswith
metalcompoundsimpregnatedwithNitrogendopedCarbon(N-
C) serving as a good replacement for Pt. Transition metals such
as Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni in their salt forms have been infused
with precursor aminoantipyrine (AAPyr) and used as cathode
catalystsinMFCs( Kodalietal.,2017).
In this
study, laccase in the three immobilized states (Cross-
linking, entrapment in beads, and micellar encapsulation) was
compared with freely suspended enzyme with respect to dye
decolourization, enzyme activity retention, power production,
and reusability in the cathode of a microbial fuel cell. This studyaimedtoemphasizetheeﬀectofimmobilizationonlaccaseability
to perform as eﬃcient cathode catalysts. The performance of
the laccase electrode in terms of power generation only was
also evaluated against platinum and chemical based platinum
alternatives(Fe-N/Ccatalyst).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals
Laccase enzyme (13.6 U/mg) from Trametes versicolor was
obtainedfromSigmaAldrich.Allchemicalswereanalyticalgrade
and were purchased from Sigma. Shewanella oneidensis MR1
strain 14063 was purchased from NCIMB (UK). The Fe-N/C
catalyst was obtained from Dr. J. Masa from Ruhr-University
BochuminGermany.
Laccase Immobilization
Polyaniline Laccase
Polyaniline (PANI) immobilization was carried out by
electropolymerization of 0.1M Aniline in 1M Sulphuric
acid with carbon ﬁber (2.5 cm2) as working electrode, titanium
wire as counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as reference using
KeysightB2900Apotentiostat.Acurrentdensityof4.5mAcm−2
for 50 sec was used for electropolymerization of aniline onto
bare carbon electrodes. After electropolymerization, PANI was
functionalised using 1.25% glutaraldehyde at 37◦C for 15min.
This was followed by the addition of laccase enzyme 1U ml−1
(60 Units) to the solution for cross linking for 15min. Enzyme
assay of the laccase solution was carried out before and after
crosslinkingtogetanestimateofamountoflaccaseimmobilized
(Mani,2019).
Copper Alginate Beads
T
he Cu-Alginate immobilization procedure was adapted from
Teerapatsakul et al. (2008). A 3% w/v sodium alginate was
dissolved in
40ml of water. A 1U ml−1(60 Units) laccase was
added to the alginate solution. The above mixture was passed
through a 21-gauge syringe into 0.15M cross-linker copper
sulfate solution. The beads were allowed to rest for 45min after
which they were washed with and incubated in acetate buﬀer.
EnzymeassaywasperformedonthelaccaseimmobilizedCu-Alg
beads andtheremainingcross-linking solution todetermine the
immobilizationyield.
Naﬁon Micelles Preparation
The salt modiﬁed Naﬁon micelles were prepared according to
the method developed by Meredith et al. (2012). Two ml of
5% w/v N
aﬁon solution (Sigma) was added to 78.3mg of TBAB
(tetrabutylammonium bromide) and vortexed at 1,500 rpm for
10min. The solution was poured in a weighing boat and the
solventwasallowedtoevaporate.After18hayellowtransparent
ﬁlm was formed at the bottom of a weighing tray. The tray was
thenﬁlledwith18M/Omega1 deionised(DI)waterandsoakedfor24h
to remove the excess alkyl ammonium bromide salts and HBr.
The water was removed, and the polymer rinsed with DI water
and allowed to dry. The resulting dry ﬁlm was suspended in 2
mlethanol.

Analytical Procedures
Structural and Functional Characterization of the
Electrodes
The morphology of the immobilized laccase was studied using
Inspect-F scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with
EDAXatanacceleratingvoltageof30kV.ThepresenceofPANI
and Naﬁon functional groups was detected using Perkin Elmer
Spectrum Two FTIR-ATR Spectrometer with a plain carbon
electrodeasthebackground.
Electrochemical Analysis of Laccase Crosslinked
With PANI and Laccase in Naﬁon Micelles
The cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements for activity of
laccase was performed in a three-electrode system with the
working electrode as the PANI laccase/Naﬁon laccase electrode,
platinum as the counter, and Ag/AgCl as reference electrode.
Sincetheenzymewasimmobilizedontheelectrode,ABTSassay
did not serve as an accurate method for enzyme activity, as the
enzyme leached into the solution also accounted for the laccase
activity rather than the enzyme on the electrode alone. The
CV was carried out in pH 4.5 acetate buﬀer (100mM) using a
potentiostat Keysight B2900A by cycling between potential of
−1–1.5Vatascanrateof20mVs−1.
Acid Orange 7 Dye Decolourization
The concentration of AO7 in the cathode for laccase systems
was measured at various time intervals using a UV-visible
spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 484nm which is
the maximum absorption wavelength for the dye. The

Enzyme Activity
The activity of free laccase and coper alginate immobilized
laccase was measured using ABTS [2,2′-azino-bis(3-

solution of 2ml acetate buﬀer (100mM, pH 4.5), 0.1ml ABTS
(0.5mM), and 0.1ml of enzyme was used for freely suspended
enzyme and 300mg for Cu-alginate beads. The oxidation of
ABTS by laccase was measured by a UV spectrophotometer at
420nm (Bakhshian et al., 2011). The enzyme activity unit (U)

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Characterization of Immobilized Laccase
Biocathode Systems
The immobilized laccase biocathodes were analyzed for their
functional, morphological, and electrochemical characteristics
usingFTIR,SEM,andcyclicvoltammetry,respectively.
Functional Analysis of Laccase Biocathodes
Functional analysis was performed for polymer-based laccase
immobilized biocathodes viz. PANI-laccase and Naﬁon-laccase.
As both the immobilizations were multi-step procedures it was
necessarytounderstandthemodiﬁcationsinthepolymerduring
eachstepandtherobustnessofthelaccaseonimmobilization.
FTIR was carried out to conﬁrm the presence of PANI
functionalization on the electrode (Figure1A ). The 1314 cm−1
is typical of PANI (emeraldine base) attributed to C-N stretch
vibration of the quinoid ring. The peak at 1175 cm−1indicates
the vibration mode of –NH+of the charged polymer. After
the glutaraldehyde cross linking, this mode disappears due to
crosslinking with laccase. This mode in PANI is responsible
for the delocalized electron and hence the conductivity. The
peak at 882 cm−1corresponds to the N-H wag of the 1◦and
2◦amine which disappears on cross-linking with the enzyme
(Figure1A). Another peak characteristic of the PANI deposited

sulphonation of the aniline ring due to the substitution of the
SO−
3in place of NH+
3(Figure1A ). The strong peak observed
at 1627 cm−1is due to the C=C in vibration within the ring
(StejskalandGilbert,2006).
The Na
ﬁon functional group showed a CF stretch at
1134 cm−1and 1213 cm−1which is characteristic of
tetraﬂuoroethylenebackbone(Figure1B).Themildpeakat1048

40 N+embedded within the polymer (Figure1B) (Hu et al.,
2016). On
laccase immobilization, the peak intensity increased,
which mig
ht be due to the catalysis and higher vibrational
modes achieved due to the charging of the polymer. The laccase
was characterized by the peaks at 1559 and 1959 cm−1which
indicates the amine and carboxylic moiety of its amino acids
(Figure1B). For both PANI and Naﬁon immobilization, laccase
wascharacterizedbythepresenceofAmideI(1600–1690cm−1)
and Amide II (1480–1575 cm−1) for -CO and -NH stretch,
respectively( KongandYu,2007).
Morphological Analysis of
the PANI/PANI-Laccase
Biocathode
Morphological analysis was performed for PANI laccase, Cu-
Alg laccase, and Naﬁon laccase biocathode systems. The main
signiﬁcance of this study was to understand the porosity
of the electrode and structural changes in the polymer on
immobilizationofthelaccase.
SEM images reveal the PANI ﬁbers on the carbon electrode
andtheimmobilizedlaccase(Figure2a-Inset).PANIappearsasa

Crosslinking causes slight disruption of the membrane with the
globular structure more prominent after laccase immobilization
(Figure2a).TBAB modiﬁed Naﬁon was found to coalesce to form a ﬁlm
ontheelectrodesurface(Figure2b-Inset).UnlikePANIﬁlm,the
Naﬁonmembraneisevenlydistributedoverthecarbonﬁlaments.
The porosity of the electrode was found to be decreased on
the ﬁlm formation, which might aﬀect the charge density. A
gelation of the Naﬁon polymer is seen on addition of TBAB. In
the presence of laccase, the ﬁlm appears to be a thick layer of
membrane compared to bare Naﬁon/TBAB (Figure2b). Unlike
PANI-Laccase, Naﬁon-laccase ﬁlm was seen to be restricted to
the surface of the electrode. In addition, the aggregate size
of the enzyme-polymer was larger in size as compared to
thePANI-laccase.
Electrochemical Analysis of PANI and
Naﬁon-Laccase Electrodes
The electrochemical analysis of the immobilized laccase
biocathodeswerelimitedtothePANI-laccaseandNaﬁon-laccase
biosystemsbecauseoftheconductivityofthepolymerused.
The redox property of the PANI-Laccase biocathode was
analyzed by cyclic voltammetry. An oxidation peak at 0.2V
indicates the presence of polyaniline on the electrode surface
(Figure3A).
PANI did not display the multiple peaks usually observed
in strong acids, as the electrolyte used in this study was a
weak acetate buﬀer. Polyaniline is easily oxidized in less acidic
solutions as pH increases. The electrochemical behavior of
polyaniline is dependent on many parameters e.g., the choice of
material and the surface area of the electrodes, composition of
the electrolyte, pH and temperature etc. ( Song and Choi, 2013).
On cross-linking
with laccase an additional peak was observed
at−0.32V which might indicate oxygen reduction reaction (Le
Goﬀ et al.,
2015). With increasing scan rate the rise in cathodic
peak current wa
s proportional to the square root of scan rate,
indicatinganoxygendiﬀusionlimitedprocess(Figure3A-Inset).
Thus,thelaccasecatalyticactivitywaspreservedoncross-linking
withPANI(Figure3A ).
Naﬁon polymer alone did not show any characteristic peaks
due to absence of the characteristic redox moiety. The increase

presence of
laccase the ORR takes place on the surface and the
reduction peak appears at −0.6V limited by oxygen diﬀusion
(Figure3B-Inset). Naﬁon-laccase showed an overpotential as
compared to the PANI laccase, which might be due to poor
electronconductivityoftheNaﬁon(Figure3B).
Power Generation From MFCs Utilizing the
Immobilized Laccase Electrodes
The maximum voltage of 480 ±20mV was recorded across 2
k/Omega1in the MFC with PANI laccase followed by freely suspended
laccase (420 ±14mV), Naﬁon-laccase at 405 ±30mV, and Cu-
Alginate laccase at 350 ±25mV. The higher voltage of PANI
MFCs compared to those with freely suspended laccase was
probably due to the decreased proximity between the catalytic
sites and the electrode, thus decreasing the ohmic and masstransfer resistance. Moreover, PANI is a conducting polymer,
it decreases the charge transfer resistance of the electrode thus
permitting the easy electron transfer. Although Naﬁon is also
a conducting polymer, it is known to be an ionic conductor
rather than an electron conductor ( Heitner-Wirguin, 1996). In
thisstudy,la
ccaseembeddedintheNaﬁonwithoutanymediators
was less eﬃcient in transferring electrons from the electrode
to the enzyme compared to PANI. The low voltage of Cu-Alg
laccase system was probably due to the high diﬀusion barrier
imposed by beads to both oxygen and electron transfer from the
electrode. This agreed with the maximum power density which
was 38±1.7 mWm−2for MFCs with PANI and 28 ±0.98
mWm−2for freely suspended laccase, 25.6 ±2.08 mW m−2
for Naﬁon and 14.7 ±1.04 mW m−2for laccase entrapped in
beads (Figure4). A maximum power density of only 6.5 mW
m−2was observed by Schaetzle et al. (2009) when laccase was
immobilizedinhydrogels

PANI, Na
ﬁon and freely suspended enzyme have better contact
with the electrode compared to the beads. The OCV for PANI
laccase reached up to 900 ±35mV while for free laccase it was
700±20mV, 640 ±48mV for Naﬁon, and 500 ±32mV for
laccase in Cu-alginate beads. The internal resistance for MFCs
withPANIwas1.4 ±0.15k/Omega1whichwasthelowestcomparedto
2±0.12 k/Omega1for free laccase and 7.5 ±1 k/Omega1for the beads which
was directly related to the above factors of ohmic and diﬀusion
barrier. The internal resistance for naﬁon laccase was 5.3 ±0.5
k/Omega1which might account for the low power output compared
to PANI laccase. The coulombic eﬃciency was quite low for all
systems with PANI-laccase highest at 4.65 ±0.18%, Naﬁon with
4.23±0.45%, Free laccase 3.83 ±0 .112%, and the lowest was
Cu-Alg with 2.97 ±0.16%. In addition, PANI laccase electrodes
were reusable for up to three cycles with the power and activity
decreasing each cycle. Naﬁon and Cu-Alg laccase were reusable
fortwomorecycles(Datain SupplementaryTables1, 2).
Dye Decolourization in MFCs Utilizing the
Laccase Biocathodes
There was 85 ±3.5% decolourization by MFC with enzyme in
the freely suspended form compared to 75.6 ±2.1% for PANI
laccase and 73 ±2.04% Naﬁon laccase over a period of 5 days
(Figure5A). The decolourization in MFCs with Cu-Alg beads
laccase was 81 ±4.47%. There was >50% decolourization in
the ﬁrst 24h for free and Cu-Alg laccase. Zille et al. (2003)
inferredthatonimmobilizationtheproteinbecomesrestrictedto
interact
with the dye. Freely suspended laccase has the freedom
of movement to interact with the dye and bring about better
decolourization in thisstudy. Same trend was obtained by Savizi
et al., where freely suspended laccase enzyme decolourized 77%
of RB 221 dye compared to 70% in immobilized laccase ( Savizi
et al.,2012
). In addition, the amount of enzyme cross-linked on
the PANI
laccase was lower than the case of freely suspended

glutaraldehyde
which also contributes to lower decolourization.
Similarly, for Naﬁon-laccase limitation of the dye movement
to the active site of the enzyme might have resulted in lower
decolourizationcomparedtofreelaccaseandCu-Alglaccase.The
initial rapid decolourization is due to the high enzyme activity
initially; the rate of decolourization decreases gradually as the
enzymeactivitydecreasesasshownintheenzymeactivitygraphs

decrease in activity for PANI-laccase and Naﬁon laccase on
the electrodes were measured through cyclic voltammetry by
comparingthecathodicpeakcurrent(Ipc)eachdaytotheinitial

Naﬁon-Laccase indicated a decrease in Ipc with the number of
days.(Figure6-Inset).
The relative percentage decrease in enzyme activity for each
electrode compared to their initial activity is shown in Figure7.
PANILaccaseretained81 ±2.5%activityafteroneMFCcycle(5

activity after the ﬁrst MFC cycle (5 days). The rate of enzyme
deactivation was highest for freely suspended laccase with about
15.2±0.12% decrease in relative enzyme activity per day. The
enzyme activity was also observed to be decreasing in Naﬁon-
laccase with loss of activity at the rate of 6 ±0.39% per day in

Comparison of the Performance of
Laccase Biocathode Systems With the
Conventional Pt and Fe Impregnated
Catalyst (Fe-N/C) in MFCs
ThelaccasebiocathodeMFCsystemsabovewerecomparedwith
the traditional Pt and Fe impregnated N-doped carbon catalyst
with regards to power generation in Shewanella oneidensis-
based MFCs. Pt and Fe-N/C produced a power density of 80
±0.5 and 54.4 ±0.84 mW m−2, respectively (Figure8). The
highest power density produced by laccase biocathode (PANI-
Laccase) (38 ±1.7 mW m−2) was much lower than that of
Pt (80±0.5 mW m−2,Figure8), but factors such as cost
of the enzyme and its concomitant dye decolourization rates
serve as a major advantage. The cost of platinum is 2.5 times
higher than that of laccase enzyme. one gm of platinum costs
£198 (Sigma Aldrich) compared to laccase at £70/gm (Sigma
Aldrich). Enzyme loading in our study is much less compared
to other studies ( Teerapatsakul et al., 2008; Savizi et al., 2012).
The normalized power
output for platinum was 0.04 and 0.07
mW/£forlaccase.Laccasethereforehas1.75timeshigherpower
output per pound compared to platinum. The use of platinum

enzyme or platinum
need not consider cost alone; other factors
such as stability and reusability of catalyst, possible leaching of
catalyst in the waste stream being treated, as well as eﬀect of
environmental conditions on catalyst performance should also
be considered. Enzymes require optimized conditions for their
performance such as stable pH, temperature etc. but have the
versatilityofbeingengineeredforbetterperformance.
CONCLUSION
In this study, diﬀerent methods of immobilization of laccase i.e.,
cross-linkingwithpolyaniline(PANI),entrapmentinCualginate
beads and encapsulation in Naﬁon micelles, were investigated
with regards to their application as biocathodes in Shewanella
based MFC for purposes of azo dye decolourization. Laccase

A model aromatic compound, sodium benzoate, is generally used for simulating
aromatic pollutants present in textile efﬂuents. Bioremediation of sodium benzoate was
studied using the most abundant bacteria, Pseudomonas citronellolis, isolated from
the efﬂuent treatment plants of South Gujarat, India. Multiple nutrients constituting the
efﬂuent in actual conditions are proposed to have interactive effects on biodegradation
which needs to be analyzed strategically for successful ﬁeld application of developed
bioremediation process. Two explicitly different sets of fractional factorial designs
were used to investigate the interactive inﬂuence of alternative carbon, nitrogen
sources, and inorganic micronutrients on sodium benzoate degradation. The process
was negatively inﬂuenced by the co-existence of other carbon sources and higher
concentration of KH 2PO4whereas NH 4Cl and MgSO 4exhibited positive effects.
Optimized concentrations of NH 4Cl, MgSO 4, and KH 2PO4were found to be 0.35,
1.056, and 0.3 mg L 1respectively by central composite designing. The negative
effect of high amount of KH 2PO4could be ameliorated by increasing the amount
of NH 4Cl in the biodegradation milieu indicating the possibility of restoration of the
degradation capability for sodium benzoate degradation in the presence of higher
phosphate concentration.

INTRODUCTION
India is the second largest textile product-exporting country worldwide, and textile sector plays a
major role in the employment, economic growth, and ﬁnancial empowerment to millions of Indians
from smll handicraft units to large apparel industries. Gujarat is a major textile-manufacturing hub
in the country. Textile industries utilize huge amount of fresh water for production of ﬁnished
goods. Eﬄuents generated from fabric printing, yarn printing, and dyeing can cause considerable
amount of damage to the environment due to the presence of colors, salts, and a variety of
recalcitrant compounds (Ayed et al., 2012). Years of research has indicated the importance and
cost eﬀectiveness of biological treatment over physicochemical method for textile wastewater
treatment. However, bioremediation as a bioprocess when applied to ﬁeld becomes one of the

Zaveri et al. Effects of Nutrients on Biodegradation
most dynamic and complex interplay of pollutants, nutrients, and
microorganisms. Microbial community present in contaminated
environment (e.g., soil, water, wastewater) generally has eﬃcient
microbial degraders like Pseudomonas species in adequate
numbers (Rossello-mora et al., 1994; Junca and Pieper, 2004).
Such highly versatile organisms are found to have an ability to
metabolize complex/toxic hydrocarbons like phenol, toluene, and
phenanthrene under laboratory conditions (Lakshmi et al., 2013).
The question arises, with so diverse metabolic capability why such
eﬃcient microbial community fails to generate the laboratory-
evident degradation rate under ﬁeld conditions? The limitation
lies in our understanding to generate conducive environment,
interplay of nutrients, translation of bioremediation to ﬁeld, and
strategic optimization of bioprocess developed in laboratory. To
understand the interaction and interference of various macro-
and micronutrient on biodegradation, statistical optimization
was employed using a simplest model hydrocarbon such as
sodium benzoate (SB) which was used to mimic aromatics in
textile wastewater (Y aseen and Scholz, 2019), by P. citronellolis
(GenBank accession number: KM871063) (Zaveri et al., 2015).
Under various environmental conditions, sodium benzoate has
been reported to travel through route of wastewaters and
end up in sludge (Wibbertmann et al., 2005). Though it is
easily biodegradable under controlled laboratory conditions
(Wibbertmann et al., 2005), reports also suggest that the
presence of preferable carbon and/or nitrogen sources (glucose,
acetate, amino acids, etc.) result in either increase or decrease
in hydrocarbon biodegradation eﬃciency (Chun et al., 2004;
Jonsson et al., 2007; Das and Chandran, 2011). Hence, in
the presence of easily assimilable carbon sources, hydrocarbon
compounds will be least preferred and may not be degraded.
Similarly, even if the organisms have the capacity to degrade such
hydrocarbon compounds, but in absence of suitable nitrogen
sources, the compounds remain undegraded.
It is known that deﬁciency of required inorganic nutrients
may lead to lower biodegradation rates which may be a result
of nutrient starvation leading to degradation of cellular proteins
(John and Goldberg, 1980; Walworth et al., 2007). However,
there are reports which also suggest that supplementing the
depleted inorganic nutrients may not be the stimulus each time
as these metabolic processes are dependent on interplay of
compounds and/or organisms (Swindoll et al., 1988; Steﬀensen
and Alexander, 1995). Thus, optimization of bioprocess turns
out to be the key factor for processes like enzyme production
as well as biodegradation to achieve high biodegradation
eﬃciency (Dibblef and Bartha, 1979; Leahy and Colwell, 1990;
Y an et al., 2014; Priyadharshini and Bakthavatsalam, 2016;
Hashem et al., 2018).
With increased access to sophisticated statistical software
and computing, research ﬁeld witnesses large application of
Design of Experiment (DOE) mathematical tool for bioprocess
engineering. Statistical designing of experiments has been
shown to be a very important tool in optimizing various
media components for industrial scale processes such as
production of enzymes (Abdel-Fattah et al., 2005; Yuan et al.,
2008; Demir et al., 2015), biodegradation of various toxic
compounds (Östberg et al., 2007; de Guillén-Jiménez et al., 2012;Ibn Abubaker et al., 2012; Lakshmi et al., 2013; Su and Lin,
2013), biodegradation in marine environment (Zahed et al.,
2010), bacterial biomass production (Gutierrez-Rojas et al., 2011;
Zhang et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2015), etc. As these tools
have the capability to display interactive inﬂuential eﬀect of
variables, they have replaced conventional one-variable-at-a-
time approach (OV AT) for multivariant experiments. Plackett-
Burman design (PBD), a fractional factorial design, determines
critical/signiﬁcant variables aﬀecting the processes in a limited
number of experiments (Burman and Plackett, 1946). This design
helps to illustrate and identify the eﬀect of each parameter
on the bioprocess and their interaction with each other (El-
Hamid et al., 2018). It has also been found to be helpful in
attaining increased gene expression and enzyme production
(Abdel-Fattah et al., 2007; Halder et al., 2013; Meng et al.,
2015). The screened variables/components signiﬁcantly aﬀecting
the biodegradation process can then be further optimized using
response surface methodology (RSM) (Darvishmotevalli et al.,
2019). For a generation of response plots, various designs
like central composite design (CCD), Box-Behnken design, etc.
are widely applied.
In the present study, ﬁeld condition was simulated for
degradation of single-ring hydrocarbon with the help
of statistical tools for characterization of main eﬀect of
variables, i.e., nutrients, on SB biodegradation process by
Pseudomonas citronellolis. Initially, in our studies on sodium
benzoate degradation by P. citronellolis, few variables were
optimized using OV AT approach including pH, substrate
concentration, temperature, aeration-agitation, and nitrogen
source. Furthermore, 9 variables were identiﬁed which were
supposed to inﬂuence SB degradation. To reduce the number of
experiments required for optimizing the rest of the 9 parameters
for SB degradation, experiments were designed using fractional
factorial design of Plackett-Burman. Out of 11 variables selected
in the PB design, two variables were having known eﬀects, i.e.,
substrate concentration and pH obtained from independent
studies using OV AT approach. In two explicitly diﬀerent sets
of PBD for studying the interaction of carbon and nitrogen
sources in degradation experiments, the importance of the
presence of micronutrients was realized. In addition, a detailed
analysis of desirable concentration and inﬂuence of variables on
each other is described using 3D response plots. Such detailed
approach can be used as platform for interactive analysis of other
combinations of nutrients, as the robustness of the design helps
the researcher to conclude the most inﬂuential variable easily.
The results obtained indicate the obstacles with degradation
of target hydrocarbon in the presence of easily degradable
substrates which might be available in surrounding environment.
The primary aim of using PBD was to evaluate the inﬂuence
of additional “C” source selected arbitrarily as supplementary
nutrients for growth of bacterial cells used for bioremediation or
various “N” sources for screening their eﬀects on SB degradation
and interaction with other media constituents. The study
deals with the nutrient interplay involved in sodium benzoate
degradation and does not focus on the mass balance and
mineralization thus stoichiometry of the benzoate degradation
process and pathways are not in the scope of the present study.

Moreover, no simulation software/AI was used to generate any
biological data, and the results are outcome of SB degradation
experiments conducted under laboratory conditions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
All chemicals used in this study were of the highest purity grade
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Merck-India, or Himedia-India.
Microorganism and Culture Activation
The bacterial strain used in this study, Pseudomonas citronellolis
was isolated from common industrial eﬄuents of South Gujarat,
India and was identiﬁed as the most abundant bacteria in eﬄuent
stream in our previous work (Zaveri et al., 2015). Activated
culture grown on nutrient broth (OD 5600.8) was harvested at
7,500 rpm at 272C temperature (Eppendorf Centrifuge Model
No. 5430 R, Germany). To ensure removal of organic matter,
activated culture was washed twice with sterile normal saline
before inoculation (5%, v/v) in autoclaved media prepared for
PBD and RSM experiments as described in the section “Statistical
Design of Experiments.”
Statistical Design of Experiments
The objective of applying statistical techniques was to reduce
the number of optimization experiments to deduce the most
optimal conditions for SB degradation using limited number of
experiments with statistical validity.
Plackett-Burman Design: Fractional Factorial
Experiment
The eﬀects of carbon and nitrogen sources and their interactions
with micronutrients on SB degradation were assessed
independently in two experimental set ups designed using PBD.
Design Expert (ver. 10) was used to prepare run combinations
for all experiments described here. Design A was formulated for
evaluation of the presence of more than one carbon sources and
design B was a representation of condition where the presence
of more than one nitrogen sources was evaluated. Essential
micronutrients (KH 2PO 4, Na 2HPO 4, MgSO 4, and CaCl 2) were
kept as common variables in both the designs although the “ 1”
concentrations were kept intentionally diﬀerent (with diﬀerence
of one level) so that they do not become the limiting factor in
runs with longer incubation period. Concentration of all other
variables in both the designs were kept at “ 1” (low) and “ + 1”
(high) levels. The concentrations and the details of the variables
used are presented in Table 1. The two levels of all factors
(concentration of “ + 1” and “ 1”) were selected in such a way as
to match either the concentration of ingredients of minimal salt
medium (MSM) (Atlas, 2005) or which helps us to further select
the concentrations to be used in ﬁve-level experimental design of
response surface methodology using CCD.
The code designations of variables were kept random to avoid
any bias in design. A total of 11 variables were considered for
investigation, where 9 were independent variables and some
were used as dummy variables (unassigned variables) viz. SBconcentration and pH in design A and only SB concentration in
design B. They were screened in 12 combinations/runs according
to the design. In design A, factors 1–5 were ingredients of
modiﬁed MSM [Na 2HPO 4,600 mg L 1; KH 2PO 4, 300 mg L 1;
NH 4Cl, 100 mg L 1; NaCl, 50 mg L 1; MgSO 4, 24.6 mg
L 1; CaCl 2, 1.4 mg L 1; and SB, 72 mg L 1(5 mM)]
selected for hydrocarbon degradation assay. Factors 6, 7,
and 8 were selected as additional substrates/“C” source to
investigate their role as supplementary/co-existing substances to
investigate whether they may support growth of more number
of cells and thus may potentially enhance SB degradation.
Also, whether they are interacting with other constituents of
medium could become clear in such experiments. Similarly,
in the case of design B, factors 1–5 were the constituents
of modiﬁed minimal salt basal medium and factors 6–9
were the nitrogen sources selected to be screened (Table 1).
All the runs were performed in triplicates with suﬃcient
negative controls. According to described concentrations,
100 ml media were prepared and inoculated with active,
washed culture (5%, v/v) of P. citronellolis and incubated at
302C under shaking conditions (80 rpm) (Remi CIS-
24 plus, India). Initial pH of the medium was adjusted using

of percent SB degradation from average values of replicates
in each run (Rajendran et al., 2007; Patil and Jena, 2015;
El-Hamid et al., 2018).
The main eﬀect plot was prepared, and using Pareto chart, the
inﬂuential factors were identiﬁed as those exhibiting values above
“t-critical’ and Bonferroni’s limit.
Central Composite Design: Response Surface
Methodology
As from the results of designs “A ” and “B, ” micronutrients viz.
NH 4Cl, MgSO 4, and KH 2PO 4were found to have a signiﬁcant
eﬀect on SB degradation bioprocess; they were then further
considered for model development using CCD through RSM.
A three-factor, ﬁve-level CCD with 20 runs was employed (Safa
et al., 2017). The variables NH 4Cl, MgSO 4, and KH 2PO 4were
denoted as factors 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and each of them
were assessed at ﬁve diﬀerent levels, combining factorial points
( 1, + 1), axial points ( a, + a), and central point (0). The
concentration used for matrix designing using CCD is projected
inTable 2 (Priyadharshini and Bakthavatsalam, 2016). Twenty
runs were required according to Design Expert (ver. 10.0), and
run details are presented as Supplementary Material. According
to levels of all three factors, with respective concentrations of
these ingredients, media were prepared in 100 ml volumes,
sterilized, and inoculated with 5% (v /v)P. citronellolis culture.
Responses were calculated as SB degradation percentages
obtained from experimental sets performed in triplicates. The
rest of all the components of modiﬁed MSM were kept to their
original concentrations including 5 mM of sodium benzoate as
sole source of carbon.
The predicted values as obtained through modeling were
compared with actual values obtained through the experiment.
Three-dimensional response plots and their respective contour
plots for all three micronutrients were prepared using Design

concentration for better SB remediation.
Monitoring of SB Degradation
All ﬂasks were incubated at 30 2C in an incubator shaker
at 80 rpm. At regular intervals, 1 ml sample was aseptically
withdrawn to determine growth of organism and degradation
of sodium benzoate. Changes in pH values were observed
using universal pH indicator (Himedia, India product code-
I013); however, it was found to be negligible. Remaining sodium
benzoate concentration was determined spectrophotometrically
at 230 nm (Agilent Technologies Carry 60 UV-Vis, United States)
(Zaveri et al., 2015). Abiotic loss of SB during incubation was less
than 2% and thus, all the degradation values were normalized
accordingly. Percent SB degradation was calculated using the
following formula:
SB degradation .%/D/bracketleftBig
.Initial SB concentration  Final SB
concentration/=Initial SB concentration/bracketrightBig
100 (1)
All the degradation experiments were performed in triplicates,
and the results presented are average of three data sets.RESULTS
Initial studies for sodium benzoate degradation were conducted
to optimize variables over a possible range for individual
parameter. This data contributed to the basic understanding
of degradation pattern and characteristic of organism under
variously stressed conditions. The “One Variable at a Time”
approach was used for basic parameters like temperature (15,
20, 25, 30, and 40C), pH (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10), agitation
(0, 80, and 150 rpm), nitrogen source (NH 4Cl and KNO 3), and
substrate concentrations (ranging from 1 to 100 mM). The results
obtained indicated that organism was able to optimally utilize 1–
50 mM sodium benzoate using NH 4Cl as source of nitrogen at
30C and at 80 rpm. The organism could not withstand pH 4
and 10 and substrate concentrations above 50 mM. The organism
was able to degrade substrate under both static and agitating
conditions; however, agitation was supporting faster degradation
as compared with static conditions. From the range of substrate
concentrations, 5 and 7 mM were selected for factorial designing
because of the least possible degradation time required and the
lowest sensitive detection with spectrophotometric method.
Statistical methods were used only to design the experimental
combinations of nutrients, based on which ﬂask-level
experiments were conducted. No data reported in the present
manuscript is software derived. All the data for SB degradation
were obtained after conducting wet lab experiments at ﬂask level.
Identiﬁcation of Major Effect in Two
Independent Plackett-Burman
Experiments
The experimental response obtained in the form of SB
degradation through both the designs according to the change in
the medium composition is depicted in Table 3. In the modiﬁed
MSM medium, Pseudomonas citronellolis could degrade SB by
more than 95% within 24 h of incubation. With the change in
the composition of the medium, degradation percentage ranged
from 0 to 68% (incubation till 18 days) in design A and 40–87%

degradation in design B (incubation till 6 days). The wide range
of values obtained indicates prominent eﬀect of multiple carbon
and nitrogen sources in the medium and interaction of variables
on degradation of sodium benzoate.
Table 3 depicts that levels of factors in run number 1 in
design A and run number 11 in design B resulted in highest
SB degradation eﬃciency of 69 and 86%, respectively. The
signiﬁcance of the experimental data generated was calculated
using the Design Expert software considering the degradation
percentage obtained from various wet lab experimental sets as
an input parameter. Based on these experimental degradation
values, the software calculates the eﬀectiveness of diﬀerent
combinations of nutrients and their concentrations and generates
the graphical presentation of positive and negative eﬀects
(Figures 1–3). The positive inﬂuence of factor here is described
in terms of higher SB degradation achieved with increasing
concentration of variable factor and vice-a-versa for negatively
inﬂuencing factors. The Pareto charts highlighted the statistically
signiﬁcant factors having either positive or negative impact on
SB degradation in decreasing order of inﬂuence and indicate
the main eﬀect factors by displaying them above “t critical” and
Bonferroni limits (Design expert Ver. 10.0) (Figures 1A,B).
The variables with negative and positive eﬀects on SB
degradation are displayed in diﬀerent colors. Out of all the
parameters analyzed for study, MgSO 4, pH, and substrate
concentrations (SB) were shown to have a positive impact,
of which the ﬁrst two were signiﬁcant for SB degradation in
design A whereas MgSO 4, CaCl 2, ammonium tartrate, and
substrate concentration (SB) in design B were shown to have
a positive impact on SB degradation, among which the ﬁrst
two were found to be signiﬁcant. On the other hand, KH 2PO 4,
Na2HPO 4, and NaCl exhibited negative eﬀect on SB degradation
in both the designs. It is important to realize that change in
the selection of macronutrients did not aﬀect the inorganic
nutrients’ requirement.
The data displayed in Pareto chart became more deﬁned
in graphs presented in Figures 2, 3when individual factors
were analyzed. As seen in Figures 2, 3, the x- and y-axis

eﬀect on degradation. On the other hand, higher levels of
ammonium tartrate, MgSO 4, CaCl 2, and substrate concentration
had positive inﬂuence on SB degradation eﬃciency. Whereas,
in the case of glycine, proline, and PNP , in both their variable
concentrations, they did not show much signiﬁcant eﬀect
on SB degradation.The ANOV A analysis of the model is represented in Table 4.

Optimization of Concentrations of Major
Inﬂuential Factors Using Central
Composite Design and Response
Surface Methodology
Steepest ascent is an experimental approach which leads
us toward optimal increase in the response. The objective
of such optimization processes involves the use of higher
or lower concentration of signiﬁcant factors to reach a
maximum degradation (Montgomery, 2017). Results of both
PBD contributed to narrowing down the main eﬀect factors
toward inorganic micronutrients. In both designs, KH 2PO 4and
Na2HPO 4displayed a negative eﬀect. Out of these two sources of
phosphate, as KH 2PO 4which was proved to be above Bonferroni
limit was then selected for further optimization. In the case of
MgSO 4, in both the designs, it came up to be highly positively
inﬂuencing factor and thus was processed for optimization via
RSM. Hydrogen ion concentration being the dummy factor was
excluded out of the next level of experimental designing. Taking
in consideration the former experiments on SB degradation in
our lab and reports on NH 4Cl being the best N source for
degradation (Zaveri et al., 2015), and thus even if it was not
indicated as an inﬂuencing factor, it was further selected in the
CCD design. Response obtained in terms of SB degradation
was analyzed, and percent degradation data is presented in
Table 5.
Sets for all runs were performed in triplicates, and
degradation percentages indicated in Table 5 represents
mean values obtained. With increase in incubation time,
there was an apparent increase in the degradation percentage.
However, run number 19 had no change in initial sodium
benzoate concentration displaying no degradation. Almost
complete degradation was achieved in the rest of all sets of
experiments performed.
Response surface graphs were obtained after analysis of data.
Surface plots and contour plots obtained depicted interaction of
selected variables for the design (Figures 4A–C). These ﬁgures
indicate responses at 24 h of incubation keeping all other
parameters constant. In the case of MgSO 4and NH 4Cl, all ﬁve
concentrations selected were found to fall in optimally required
range of concentrations for higher SB degradation. Mid-point
with 100% degradation was indicated by software with relative
upward boundaries of responses.
Figure 4B was found to be very informative as it clearly
indicates lower concentrations of phosphate being optimal forTABLE 5 | SB Degradation percentage achieved with CCD design using three

degradation by CCD design. In addition to the signiﬁcance
of the model, variable C was found to have a pvalue of
less than 0.0001, indicating a signiﬁcant importance of factor
in design development and degradation of sodium benzoate.
The calculated desirable concentration for NH 4Cl, MgSO 4,
and KH 2PO 4was found to be 0.35, 1.056, and 0.3 mg

DISCUSSION
A range of Pseudomonas spp. possesses a vital role in
bioremediation process of textile eﬄuents and aromatic
hydrocarbon compounds. Taking the advantage of PBD design,
study started with the crucial interaction of multiple carbon
sources such as, acetate, succinate, and glucose and eﬀect
of micronutrients on SB degradation by P. citronellolis, a
promising strain (Zaveri et al., 2015). The initial investigation
involved the execution of 12 diﬀerent run combinations for 11
variables (design A). The result of the study was remarkable
and indicated a clear decrease in degradation of SB in the
presence of additional carbon sources when compared with
results of SB degradation where SB was present as a sole carbon
source. Inﬂuence of inorganic micronutrients was also evident
by results of design A performed in the presence of additional
carbon sources. Results of the ﬁrst PB design provoked the
curiosity to understand the cumulative or individual eﬀect of

various nitrogen sources on the degradation eﬃciency. Another
PB experiment involving 11 independent variables in 12 runs
was designed (design B) using possible alternate nitrogen
sources, and similar micronutrients were used as in the former
design. After conﬁrming the main eﬀects from Pareto chart and
coeﬃcient table for signiﬁcance, the concentrations of variables
were further optimized by RSM.
Effect of Alternative Carbon and
Nitrogen Sources on SB
Degradation—Analysis of Fractional
Factorial Experiments
The result of the very ﬁrst eﬀort for understanding the
interaction and inﬂuence of the presence of multiple easily
assimilable carbon sources indicated an obvious negative impact
on sodium benzoate degradation (Table 3). It was observed
that when NH 4Cl, MgSO 4, CaCl 2, Na 2HPO 4, and NaCl salts
were at + 1 concentrations, and all the three additional carbon
sources were at 1 concentrations, SB degradation achievedwas maximum with a value around 69% (run number 1 in
Table 3) in design A (the experimental case with carbon
sources). Similar eﬀect of biostimulation using inorganic nutrient
(addition of N and P source) has been observed in case
of removal of solvents from textile manufacturing wastewater
(Freedman et al., 2005). Under critical environmental conditions
like hypersalinity, addition of yeast extract, glucose, KCl,
and four mineral nutrients (solutions of phosphate buﬀer,
calcium chloride, magnesium sulfate, ferric chloride, ammonium
sulfate) was reported to enhance phenol degradation capacity
(Li et al., 2010).
It was observed that the presence of multiple carbon
sources prolonged the lag phase for hydrocarbon degradation
(Wigginst and Alexander, 1988). This, however, led to generation
of considerable biomass but was not able to exhibit eﬀects
like co-metabolism as indicated by Schmidt and Alexander
(1985). The delay as well as reduction in the eﬃciency of SB
degradation can be attributed to the presence of additional
“C” source (s) which might have been used easily before the
commencement of SB degradation thus aﬀecting the overall
Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 9 March 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 634753

Zaveri et al. Effects of Nutrients on Biodegradation
activity. In this experiment, the maximum SB degradation
achieved was only 68.5% (Table 3), which did not support the
hypothesis of faster degradation of SB as a result of higher
biomass production achieved through utilization of certain easily
assimilable C source.
Similarly, textile dye Remazol black B biodegradation process
was optimized using the multifactorial Plackett-Burman design
by Hashem et al. (2018), where 11 independent factors
were included. Out of the which, eight factors were media
compositions (such as glucose concentration, yeast extract,
sodium acetate, sodium nitrate, EDTA, iron concentration,
magnesium concentration, and NaCl) and other two were
environmental conditions (temperature and pH) in addition to
dye concentration. A signiﬁcant increase in biodegradation rates
was observed in the presence of iron, magnesium, and yeast
extract and at high pH value.
Discoloration of reactive orange 4 dye was also optimized
by RSM-Box-Behnken design under diﬀerent cultural and
nutritional conditions using Pseudomonas putida SKG-1 strain.
Such experimental design allowed a 97.8% discoloration of dye
in 72 h of incubation period. Furthermore, dye discoloration was
also studied in bioreactor which gave 98% eﬃciency in 60 h of
incubation period (Garg et al., 2015).
These observations contribute signiﬁcantly to the
understanding of ﬁeld conditions for degradation of sodium
benzoate. It is believed that degradable hydrocarbon would
be taken care by the microbial community present in either
eﬄuent stream, wastewater treatment plant, soil, or sludge. The
results obtained strongly stand for the organism’s behavior of
selecting preferential carbon sources over hydrocarbons, and
thus, leading to delayed initiation or negligible SB degradation.
This indicates that the given resident time in the treatment
plant or at any contaminated site may not always result in
the removal of even degradable fraction of hydrocarbons
or pollutants. After realization of negative inﬂuence of the
presence of multiple C sources on SB degradation, another PBD
experiment was designed to investigate the eﬀects of diverse
nitrogen sources (design B).
Treatment of contaminants with preferable nitrogen source
could decrease lag phase and increase cell growth and
bioremediation activities. Nitrogen is most often the limiting
nutrient aﬀecting biodegradation of hydrocarbon. However,
it was also reported that excess amount of nitrogen source
inhibits biodegradation rate in polluted soil due to osmotic
soil water potential depression (Walworth et al., 2007). In
the present study, it was observed that with nitrogen and
minerals, lower concentration level ( 1) of NaCl, Na 2HPO 4,
cysteine, and MgSO 4resulted in maximum SB degradation,
i.e., 87% (run number 11 in Table 3). In contrast to the
observation with C sources, in the case of the second set
of experiments, occurrence of multiple N sources did not
inﬂuence SB degradation negatively. This study did not reveal
the preferential utilization of any N source over others for
SB degradation. Another observation was the absence of
delay/lag in the utilization of SB as seen in the case of
the ﬁrst PBD design and could be achieved within 24 h
optimum SB degradation.Similar to the ﬁrst PBD design, the role of inorganic
micronutrients also came out to be statistically signiﬁcant for SB
degradation in the presence of various N sources.
Interaction of Concentrations of
Micronutrients Revealed by CCD
For next level of steep ascent focusing, two factors KH 2PO 4and
MgSO 4exhibiting main eﬀects in Plackett-Burman design and
NH 4Cl were taken for CCD development. These experiments
were aimed to meticulously optimize the addition of these
nutrients for sodium benzoate degradation. Lakshmi et al. (2013)
presented reports comprising optimization of phenanthrene
degradation where, in addition to substrate concentration as a
variable, Na 2HPO 4, MgSO 4, and FeSO 4were found to be the
most important factors for degradation. Similarly, importance
and optimization of micronutrients has been emphasized in
several other degradation studies using statistical tools (Mohajeri
et al., 2010). Likewise, in a study focused on increasing
extracellular nuclease, NucB, from Bacillus licheniformis, addition
of manganese had a stimulating eﬀect with a 10-fold increase
inNucB activity. On the other hand, phosphate availability had
an inhibitory eﬀect on NucB synthesis (Rajarajan et al., 2013).
The importance of micronutrients, magnesium and phosphate,
has been emphasized for various enzyme metabolisms like
enhancing the expression of amylase enzyme in A. oryzae CBS
819.72 (Kammoun et al., 2008) and shikimic acid production in
Citrobacter freundii GR-21 (KC466031) (Rawat et al., 2013).
In one of the major observations, it was revealed that higher
NH 4Cl concentrations could ameliorate inhibitory eﬀect of
higher concentration of phosphate. Similar inhibitory eﬀect of
phosphate is observed in Figure 4C. Looking to the steepness of
the curve at high concentration of phosphate, addition of even
high concentration of MgSO 4may not help to increase sodium
benzoate degradation. Farag et al. (2018) investigated the role of
MgSO 4in crude oil biodegradation process by Pseudomonas sp.
sp48 using response surface method (Box-Behnken design). This
study revealed that the lower concentration of MgSO 4was the
best for the optimal crude oil biodegradation process.
Contour of response displayed a step-wise change in colors
toward green, indicating a decrease in the degradation percentage
with increase in KH 2PO 4concentrations. Similarly, diesel oil
degradation was optimized using PB and RSM (CCD) where
three parameters, i.e., P source (KH 2PO 4), pH, and N source
(NaNO 3) were major inﬂuencers aﬀecting oil degradation. It
was observed that middle range of KH 2PO 4concentration
(0.022 g) was suﬃcient for the ideal diesel biodegradation. The
optimal diesel oil biodegradation (total petroleum hydrocarbons
125 mg L 1) was obtained with 0.143 g of NaNO 3, 0.22 g
of KH 2PO 4, and at 7.4 pH. These results demonstrated the
cellular levels of C, N, and P ratios required for the signiﬁcant
biodegradation rate (Xia et al., 2012). This observation would
help in modulating the concentration of required nutrient in ﬁeld
conditions while facing shock loads of phosphate. Such detailed
analysis of bioprocess and optimization may lead to unfolding
of more interaction of nutrient and may help in improving the
performance of laboratory-optimized studies in the ﬁeld.

Zaveri et al. Effects of Nutrients on Biodegradation
The next question arises for the type of pathway and the
mechanism involved for sodium benzoate degradation available
with P. citronellolis which may enhance our understanding about
the complete role of nutrients in the regulation of the degradation
process. The molecular details of generalized pathway utilized
by aerobic bacteria are widely known and are available with
KEGG database. However, the associated mechanism for sodium
benzoate degradation by P. citronellolis is being explored by
studying speciﬁc enzymatic reactions, transcriptome analysis,
and gene expression studies.
CONCLUSION
Statistical methods, PB and RSM enabled to understand
the interplay of additional carbon and nitrogen sources as
well as micronutrients on sodium benzoate degradation by
P. citronellolis. Being vulnerable to biological degradation, even
sodium benzoate degradation faced severe competition due to the
co-existence of other carbon sources. Micronutrients turned out
to be the major inﬂuencing factors, of which NH 4Cl and MgSO 4
were positively inﬂuencing whereas KH 2PO 4was negatively
inﬂuencing sodium benzoate degradation. However, the negative
eﬀects of KH 2PO 4could be nulliﬁed by higher amount of NH 4Cl.
Statistically signiﬁcant model was developed for SB degradation
where the desirable concentrations of micronutrients were
derived. With the ability to quantitatively describe the interaction
eﬀects of multiple nutrients on the system response, DOE and
statistical modeling helps in strategically designing bioprocesses
for successful full-scale application of bioremediation.DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT

Wastewater discharge is a matter of concern as it is the primary source of water
pollution. Consequently, wastewater treatment plays a key role in reducing the negative
impact that wastewater discharge produce into the environment. Particularly, the
efﬂuents produced by textile industry are composed of high concentration of hazardous
compounds such as dyes, as well as having high levels of chemical and biological
oxygen demand, suspended solids, variable pH, and high concentration of salt. Main
efforts have been focused on the development of methods consuming less water or
reusing it, and also on the development of dyes with a better ﬁxation capacity. However,
the problem of how to treat these harmful efﬂuents is still pending. Different treatment
technologies have been developed, such as coagulation-ﬂocculation, adsorption,
membrane ﬁltration, reverse osmosis, advanced oxidation, and biological processes
(activated sludge, anaerobic-aerobic treatment, and membrane bioreactor). Concerning
to biological treatments, even though they are considered as the most environmentally
friendly and economic methods, their industrial application is still uncertain. On the
one hand, this is due to the costs of treatment plants installation and, on the other,
to the fact that most of the studies are carried out with simulated or diluted efﬂuents
that do not represent what really happens in the industries. Integrated treatment
technologies by combining the efﬁciency two or more methodologies used to be more
efﬁcient for the decontamination of textile wastewater, than treatments used separately.
The elimination of hazardous compounds had been reported using combination of
physical, chemical, and biological processes. On this way, as degradation products can
sometimes be even more toxic than the parent compounds, efﬂuent toxicity assessment
is an essential feature in the development of these alternatives. This article provides
a critical view on the state of art of biological treatment, the degree of advancement
and the prospects for their application, also discussing the concept of integrated
treatment and the importance of including toxicity assays to reach an integral approach
to wastewater treatment.

Ceretta et al. Biological Textile Wastewater Treatment: Present Trends
INTRODUCTION
There is an increasing awareness of how our actions impact
the environment and that is why in the last decades a great
number of environmentally friendly strategies and technologies
have been developed. In addition, and as a consequence of
social demand, environmental protection policies have been
turning more rigorous. Industrial activity is not exempt and
it is changing toward sustainable production models. Faced
with this new paradigm, textile industry represents a hot spot
since it is not only responsible for generating large volumes of
eﬄuents, but being also highly toxic. Among the physicochemical
characteristics, the composition of the eﬄuents is highly variable;
being the concentration of the parameters very diﬀerent between
the studies available in literature. This type of eﬄuent are
characterized for having a wide range of pH between values
of 5 and 12 (Singh and Singh, 2017; Y aseen and Scholz, 2019;
Pa´zdzior and Bili ´nska, 2020; Samuchiwal et al., 2021), elevated
chemical oxygen demand (COD) from 10 to 2250 mgO 2L 1
(Ghaly et al., 2014; Singh and Singh, 2017; Pa ´zdzior and Bili ´nska,
2020; Samuchiwal et al., 2021), biochemical oxygen demand
(BOD) among 100 and 3000 mgO 2L 1(I¸ sik and Sponza, 2004;
Pa´zdzior and Bili ´nska, 2020), suspended solids, heavy metals and
salts (Saratale et al., 2011; Singh and Singh, 2017; Vikrant et al.,
2018; Y aseen and Scholz, 2019). Regarding to dye concentration,
they are highly colored. For example, concentration of dyes
varies from 10 to 250 mg L 1(Ghaly et al., 2014), however,
concentrations up to 600–800 mg L 1have been found, and
the same variability is usually found for COD and BOD (Y aseen
and Scholz, 2019). This variability is a matter of concern, since
investigations for the development of treatment technologies
are mostly carried out with simulated eﬄuents. Therefore,
this represents an obstacle when the treatments developed at
laboratory scale with simulated eﬄuents must be applied since
there is no speciﬁc composition of textile wastewater.
Otherwise, textile production must overcome a series of
challenges including the development of dyes with better ﬁxation
capacity, reduction of water use, reuse of water, reduction of
costs, improvement of the ﬁnish of garments and treatment
processes, all of them tending to achieve a more sustainable
process. Consequently, the approach to the problem must
be multifactorial if we are looking to solve the impact that
textile discharges cause on the environment. Not only the
methodologies and models used in research must be adapted, but
there must be a decision on the industrial sector, accompanied by
the creation of public policies, that promote the development of
these technologies.
Reasons for the change are more than enough since the
negative eﬀects in the environment are widely known. The
degree of damage depends on the volume, composition and
duration of the discharged wastewater. This can modify the
penetration of sunlight into water bodies and change solubility
of atmospheric gases, altering photosynthesis and therefore the
entire aquatic ecosystem (O’Neill et al., 1999; Saratale et al., 2011;
Gonçalves et al., 2017; Rather et al., 2018). In addition, the
toxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic eﬀect of several compounds
present in the eﬄuents, such as dyes, have been demonstrated(Saratale et al., 2011; Dhaoueﬁ et al., 2018). Moreover, withdrawal
of heavy metals by some chemicals used as mordents, eventually
increases wastewater toxicity (Dhaoueﬁ et al., 2018).
Since many decades ago physicochemical and biological
technologies are being developed for textile wastewater
treatment. Physicochemical ones have the disadvantage of being
expensive; they have high chemical and energy requirements,
and produce secondary byproducts, which can endanger their
full-scale implementation (Dhaoueﬁ et al., 2018). In some cases,
these methods such as adsorption, chemical precipitation or
electrochemical precipitation are not able to remove compounds
like dyes or their metabolites from the wastewater, only
transferring the pollutant from one phase to another, (Hayat
et al., 2015; Singh and Singh, 2017), thus failing to solve the
problem. Otherwise, biological methods are economic, simple,
and environmentally friendly alternatives. Although signiﬁcant
toxicity reduction is observed with these treatments, pollutants
mineralization is rarely achieved. As well, microorganism’s
growth and catalytic activity is often inhibited by the presence
of toxic substances, making diﬃcult the extrapolation to-large-
scale processes. This leads to the need of modify the natural
eﬄuent conditions to carry out research, as for example the
use of simulated or diluted eﬄuents, the addition of nutritional
supplements and/or previous acclimatization. However, despite
the related problems, the treatment of textile wastewater is
required not only to do no harm the environment, but also
to recover the water from the wastewater and recycle it for
irrigation or reuse indoors the factory (Y aseen and Scholz, 2019).
REGARDING BIOLOGICAL TREATMENTS
When we talk about biological treatment, we refer to strategies
that use the abilities of microorganisms, plants or enzymes
to remove (either by degradation or sorption) a contaminant
from a matrix such as soil, sediment, air, or water (Singh and
Singh, 2017), and therefore minimize the negative impact in the
environment by reducing its toxicity. Among them, treatments
that use microorganisms (bacteria, algae, and fungi) are the
most widespread.
There is a wide range of references in which microorganisms
in pure cultures are used; an Aeromonas hydrophila was able to
reduce 72% of dyes presents in a simulated wastewater (Thanavel
et al., 2019). In other work, a Trichoderma tomentosum reached a
decolorization of 94.9% in real diluted wastewater and simulated
eﬄuent (He et al., 2018). However, nutritional supplements (such
as the addition of some carbon or nitrogen sources) and/or
previous acclimatization are frequently required in this kind
of methodologies to improve results. Even more, achieving the
sterile conditions necessary to maintain pure cultures would
not be feasible due to the high costs that this would imply
(Pa´zdzior et al., 2019).
In recent years, the use of mixed microbial cultures
(combining several bacterial and/or fungal strains), consortia
or microbial communities has gained relevance. Microbial
communities have the ability to utilize many diﬀerent carbon
sources by expressing a range of metabolic capabilities

Ceretta et al. Biological Textile Wastewater Treatment: Present Trends
(Eiler, 2006; Shade et al., 2012). As a result of the species
diversity and the cooperation between them, the eﬄuent
molecules can be attacked at several sites by diﬀerent strains
and the decomposition products generated by the metabolic
activity of one strain, may be used as a substrate by the other
one (Eiler, 2006; Dafale et al., 2008; Holkar et al., 2016). This
gives them a central role in a wide variety of biotechnological
applications, like textile wastewater treatment. In contrast, pure
cultures are associated to speciﬁc compounds, being less versatile
in terms of their biodegradation ability (Jadhav et al., 2010;
Pa´zdzior et al., 2019).
Despite the great advances in the eﬃciency of the developed
biological treatments, there are still some limitations, since
most of the researches (80%) are carried out with simulated or
synthetic eﬄuents and by the addition of nutritional sources
(Table 1). For example, microbial community found by Chen
et al. (2019) could reach a decolorization eﬃciency between 71.3
and 96.3% in a synthetic eﬄuent (600 mg L 1dye concentration),
but just after the addition of 3.00 g L 1of beef extract, 5.00 g
L 1of glucose, and 2.00 g L 1peptone. Other works used even
10 g L 1of glucose (Waghmode et al., 2019). Although good
results are achieved in terms of reducing the chemical oxygen
demand (COD) and decolorization, usually these values are for
dye concentration that does not exceed the 200 mg L 1, and as
was shown earlier dye concentration in real textile wastewater
can reach until 800 mg L 1. In addition, it should be noted
that reactor volumes in many cases are small (Valli Nachiyar
et al., 2016; Abd El-Rahim et al., 2017; Hossen et al., 2019;
Zahran et al., 2019). As an example, Hossen et al. (2019) studied
the decolorization eﬃciency of diﬀerent strains in simulated
eﬄuents, some of which reached eﬃciencies of even 90%. Since
these results are promising, they were achieved using a batch
reactor of 50 mL, a volume that is so far from the real one.
This deviation from real situation of textile wastewater makes
its subsequent application diﬃcult. Although it is true that
keeping the composition of the untreated synthetic wastewater
constant is necessary to make valid comparisons of treatment
system evaluations (O’Neill et al., 1999), after several decades
and thousands of studies that validate the eﬃciency of biological
treatments, it is necessary to leave behind the experimental
comfort of simulated eﬄuents to advance one more step in
the development of strategies based in real eﬄuents to begin
their application.
There are a few cases where real textile wastewater is used
(Table 1). Samuchiwal et al. (2021) used a microbial consortium
to degrade real wastewater, but a signiﬁcant decreases of color
of 70–73% was only achieved by the addition of yeast extract
as external input and Pre-Treatment Range (PTR) eﬄuent (with
starch) as a carbon source. In the case reported by Ceretta
et al. (2018), undiluted real textile wastewater was used, without
the addition of an extra nutritional source. The percentage of
decolorization achieved was approximately 77% of an eﬄuent
with 200 mg L 1dye concentration (Ceretta et al., 2018).
Nonetheless, the volume of the treated eﬄuent is still small
(120 mL) and there are no larger-scale studies about it.
Pa´zdzior and Bili ´nska (2020) analyzed an example of
industrial textile wastewater treatment plant large-scale for thetreatment of real undiluted textile wastewater. Despite the overall
COD removal eﬃciency exceeded 93% and varied in a narrow
range, the authors concluded that wastewater is only partially
biodegradable. Also, the treatment plant consists in a 10 step
system which raises installation costs (Pa ´zdzior and Bili ´nska,
2020). Therefore, analyzing these reports, ﬁrst we can conclude
that the combination of more than one treatment methodology
it would be necessary to achieve a better performance, by
combining the degradation eﬃciency of more than one method.
Second, that all the reviewed works have strengths but also
weaknesses, either due to the scale in which they are carried
out, the need for external inputs, pre-treatments or the use of
simulated or diluted eﬄuents. Clearly, textile eﬄuents represent
a challenge that has not yet been overcome.
IMPORTANCE OF TOXICITY
ASSESSMENT
The removal eﬃciency of the pollutants in a wastewater depends
on the treatment technology, the retention time and on the
eﬄuent composition. However, the decrease of the parameters
could not be directly related to toxicity reduction as the
byproducts could be more toxic than the parental ones. For these
reasons, it is important to measure toxicity reduction of the
treated wastewater by direct toxicity assays. These can warn the
adverse eﬀects of wastewater containing a mixture of pollutants.
Nevertheless, a key issue represents which assay will be used.
There are many classes of toxicity assays depending on the
way by how the eﬄuent will be discharged to the environment
and use for example bacteria, microalgae, invertebrates, plants
and ﬁshes as sensor organisms. Many studies not only analyze
organism growth rate but also mutagenic capacity of pollutants
by genotoxicity tests performed on diﬀerent cell lines. Also, it
is important to note that most of the studies used synthetic or
simulated wastewater, which may not be reﬂecting what could
happen in a real situation with a real wastewater.
Table 2 shows examples of diﬀerent toxicity assays performed.
Phytotoxicity is a very fast an economic method to test
toxicity. It measures seed germination, root elongation, seedling
development as main parameters and is the most widespread
assay (Valli Nachiyar et al., 2016; Ceretta et al., 2018; Chen et al.,
2018; He et al., 2018; Waghmode et al., 2019). For other toxicity
tests, as genotoxicity and zootoxicity, there are fewer studies
available in literature (Pa ´zdzior et al., 2017; Dhaoueﬁ et al., 2018;
Przysta ´s et al., 2018; Oliveira et al., 2020). The comparison of
the results of phytotoxicity assay with other toxicity test, such as
zootoxicity for the same treated wastewater showed diﬀerences.
For example, Oliveira et al. (2020) showed no reduction of the
phytotoxicity, while for zootoxicity a maximum reduction of 47%
was obtained. The same was observed for the study of Przysta ´s
et al. (2018), but with opposite results. In addition to these
observations, phytotoxicity analysis of wastewater treated only
by biological methods, most of the times showed about 50% or
less in toxicity reduction, while when biological treatments are
combined with other treatments, the toxicity reduction increase
(Dhaoueﬁ et al., 2018; Waghmode et al., 2019).

Yu et al. (2019) studied the correlation between the
toxicity reduction of 12 wastewater treatment plants, from an
industrial park, with the treatment process. They used a group
of toxicity assays involving microorganism, phytoplankton,
zooplankton, plant, and human cell lines. All the inﬂuents
of wastewater treatment plants induced high toxicities. Seven
from all the studied wastewater treatment plants showed a
signiﬁcant toxicity reduction after the treatment. However, the
eﬄuents of ﬁve of them induced higher toxicity in one or
more toxic endpoints compared to the inﬂuents. Also, among
all toxic endpoints evaluated low correlation coeﬃcients were
obtained, indicating that set of toxicity assays was necessary to
completely characterize the toxicity and risk of wastewater in
industrial parks.
Finally, a more careful analysis has to be done about the
toxicity of the wastewater and that it is not enough to choose just a
toxicity assay. It is important to select the test taking into account
the ﬁnal objectives of the treatment. For example, if the aim is to
reuse the water for irrigation purpose, it will be convenient to use
phytotoxicity assays, if the aspiration is the ﬁnal discharge into
water bodies, it may be more appropriate zootoxicity test with
aquatic organisms.AN INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH
FOR A GENUINE TEXTILE WASTEWATER
TREATMENT
Currently, focus is not on technologies that degrade and
decrease color, rather on those that can produce reusable
water, recuperate salt and/or dyes, fully mineralize the target
contaminant and mainly reduce toxicity (Holkar et al., 2016).
As we have seen so far, there are a huge diversity treatment
types with their strengths and weaknesses, and when they are
used separately the mentioned aims can rarely be achieved. Last
years, researchers have been working in the development of
sustainable water treatment strategies that eﬃciently combined
physical, chemical and biological processes for the treatment of
diﬀerent wastewaters. The design of this integrated treatment
processes is also gaining importance in the ﬁeld of textile
wastewater (Waghmode et al., 2019; Bhanot et al., 2020; Pa ´zdzior
and Bili ´nska, 2020). While in the last decades the number of
investigations carried out on the subject has remained constant,
in the last 5 years literature in which two or more treatment
techniques are combined have quadrupled.

Ceretta et al. Biological Textile Wastewater Treatment: Present Trends
The eﬀects of diﬀerent combinations like physicochemical
pre-treatment followed by a biological treatment or vice
versa had been largely studied. For example, sequential
photocatalytic and biological treatment with an artiﬁcial
microbial consortium reach 100% degradation rate in a
simulated textile wastewater within 4 h, also decreasing COD
and phytotoxicity (Waghmode et al., 2019). In other study, a
bacterial consortium isolated from a dyeing factory showed
an eﬃcacy of 77.6 3.0% in decolorizing wastewater (Ceretta
et al., 2018). When it was coupled with photocatalysis using
ZnO/Polypyrrole during only 60 min, the total decolorization
eﬃciency increased to 95.7% and 99.8% TOC degradation
(Ceretta et al., 2020). Besides the good eﬃciency reached, the
scaling-up of these processes is still pending. Pa ´zdzior et al.
(2017), investigate diﬀerent combinations of chemical and
biological methods, resulting the best one this combining
biodegradation followed by the ozonation with an activated
sludge, in a diluted real wastewater, producing the highest
toxicity reduction (98%). Similar results were obtained
by Aravind et al. (2016), who combined biodegradation
followed by photo-assisted electro-oxidation and reaches a
decolorization of 98%.
As we saw in this quick analysis, there are many technology
designs that combine biological and physicochemical treatments.
Researches carried out have shown that integrated treatments
signiﬁcantly improve the removal of organic matter, achieve
higher decolorization percentages, reduce toxicity and even
reach mineralization of contaminants (Oller et al., 2011; Hayat
et al., 2015; Aravind et al., 2016; Pa ´zdzior et al., 2017, 2019).
The eﬃciency of studies that apply biological pre-treatments
followed by physicochemical treatments has been compared
with those that did it by the other way. Although there is no
consensus in which is the best one, due to the characteristics
of the textile eﬄuents, greater diﬃculties have been observed
in the eﬄuent treatment when the physicochemical pre-
treatments are employed (Pa ´zdzior et al., 2019). Furthermore,
in this way pre-treatment times are much longer, increasing
costs due to the energy and chemical requirements (Qian
et al., 2013; Aravind et al., 2016), added to the fact that
degradation products can be toxic. Using biodegradation as
pre-treatment has the advantage not only of being cheaper,
but also due to the enzymatic microbial machine that has the
versatility to accommodate any xenobiotic substances which
may be present and degrade it (Saratale et al., 2011; Singh
and Singh, 2017). Thus, the biological treatment contribute to
the overall organic and color removal, and the physicochemical
ones cooperate in completing the degradation of pollutants
in a shorter time and also contributing to the sterilization
of the biotreated wastewater for its subsequent discharge
(Pa´zdzior et al., 2019).
The case of study of Pa ´zdzior and Bili ´nska (2020) is important
since analyzed a large-scale industrial textile wastewater
treatment plant. In this plant biological, chemical and physical
methods (such as ﬁltration, ozonation, biological treatment with
activated sludge) are combined. While improving of BOD 5/COD
ratio and COD reductions, the authors concluded that after
a ten steps system wastewater is only partly biodegradable(Pa´zdzior and Bili ´nska, 2020). These examples bring out the
complexity of textile wastewater.
CONCLUSION
The ﬁrst recorded review on the treatment of textile wastewater,
which compiles diﬀerent methodologies and their eﬃciency in
the removal of dyes, dates from 1971 (Porter, 1971). But after ﬁve
decades of research and with thousands of accumulated works,
according to the United Nations 80% of industrial wastewaters
are still being discharged into the environment without treatment
(United Nations World Water Assessment Programme, 2017).
To date, some certainties have been reached but there are still
a few challenges to overcome. The ﬁrst ones conﬁrm that progress
has been made in the ﬁeld of textile wastewater treatment:
(i) the use of consortia or microbial communities makes the
biodegradation of complex compounds possible;
(ii) the use of combined toxicity assays is necessary to
determine the eﬃciency of the applied treatments;
(iii) the development of integrated treatments by combining
two or more methodologies allows to achieve higher
percentages of degradation.
Among the challenges that are pending to be solved: the
study of treatment methodologies using real eﬄuents, the scaling
up of the processes with the corresponding cost analysis, the
development of economically attractive alternatives to achieve
adoption by the industrial sector, and ﬁnally reducing water
consumption by reusing it.
It is evident that the combination of physical, chemical and
biological methods must be used to carry out a successful
treatment, not only in terms of reducing dye concentration
and COD, but also for reducing pH, BOD, toxicity. All this
objectives will be reached only if the work is carried out in
an interdisciplinary way, where scientiﬁc evidence, engineering
dimensions, but also economic and political ones are taken into
account. The implementation of this type of alternatives will
only be possible with the support of public policies that value
and accompany by supporting, the implementation of eﬄuent
treatment strategies for the environment protection.

Laccase is a copper-containing polyphenol oxidase with a wide range of substrates,
possessing a good application prospect in wastewater treatment and dye degradation.
The purpose of this research is to study the degradation of various industrial dyes by
recombinant laccase rlac1338 and the mutant enzyme lac2-9 with the highest enzyme
activity after modiﬁcation by error-prone PCR. Four enzyme activities improved mutant
enzymes were obtained through preliminary screening and rescreening, of which lac2-9
has the highest enzyme activity. There are four mutation sites, including V281A, V281A,
P309L, S318G, and D232V. The results showed that the expression of the optimized
mutant enzyme also increased by 22 2% compared to the unoptimized enzyme
and the optimal reaction temperature of the mutant enzyme lac2-9 was 5C higher
than that of the rlac1338, and the optimal pH increased by 0.5 units. The thermal
stability and pH stability of mutant enzyme lac2-9 were also improved. With ABTS as
the substrate, the k cat/Kmof rlac1338 and mutant strain lac2-9 are the largest than
other substrates, 0.1638 and 0.618 s 1M 1, respectively, indicating that ABTS is the
most suitable substrate for the recombinant enzyme and mutant enzyme. In addition,
the K mof the mutant strain lac2-9 (76 mM) was signiﬁcantly lower, but the k cat/Km(0.618
s 1M 1) was signiﬁcantly higher, and the speciﬁc enzyme activity (79.8 U/mg) increased
by 3.5 times compared with the recombinant laccase (22.8 U/mg). The dye degradation
results showed that the use of rlac1338 and lac2-9 alone had no degradation effect
on the industrial dyes [indigo, amaranth, bromophenol blue, acid violet 7, Congo red,
coomassie brilliant blue (G250)], however, adding small molecular mediators Ca2Cand
ABTS at the same time can signiﬁcantly improve the degradation ability. Compared to
the rlac1338, the degradation rates with the simultaneous addition of Ca2Cand ABTS of
mutant enzyme lac2-9 for acid violet 7, bromophenol blue and coomassie brilliant blue

signiﬁcantly improved by 8.3; 3.4 and 3.4 times. Therefore, the results indicated that the
error-prone PCR was a feasible method to improve the degradation activity of laccase
for environmental pollutants, which provided a basis for the application of laccase on
dye degradation and other environmental pollutants.

INTRODUCTION
Laccase, ﬁrst discovered in the sap of the Japanese lacquer
tree Rhus vernicefera (Wang and Chen, 2003) is one of the
earliest enzymes studied. It belongs to the copper oxidase family.
Laccase can use O 2to oxidize various aromatics and non-
aromatic compounds through free radical catalytic reactions.
Laccase has a wide range of sources, mainly from plants, fungi,
and bacteria. With the gradual discovery of the function of
laccase in dye degradation, the research on laccase has received
extensive attention.
At present, there are more than 10,000 industrial dyes,
according to the composition, it can be divided into azo, indigo,
anthraquinone and triphenylmethane dyes. The mechanism of
laccase on dyes from diﬀerent sources is very diﬀerent (Zhang
et al., 2017). Laccase can directly oxidize anthraquinone dyes
(Li, 2013) and azo dyes (Si et al., 2011); for some recalcitrant
dyes, laccase often requires the participation of small molecular
mediators to achieve eﬃcient decolorization. For example,
Susana et al. (2007) used the laccase mediator system to degrade
reactive black and sky blue, the results showed that the laccase
mediator system had a degradation rate of 90% for reactive black
within 30 min, and the degradation rate for sky blue was also up
to 30%, and the laccase system alone has almost no degradation
eﬀect on these two dyes.
At present, enzyme modiﬁcation methods are mainly grouped
into two categories, namely rational design methods and non-
rational design methods (Mills et al., 1967). Among them, non-
rational design does not need to understand the relationship
between protein structure and function. By simulating the
process of natural evolution in the laboratory, after random
mutation, recombination and selection, the long natural
evolution process can be simulated in a short time. The error-
prone PCR (error-prone PCR) selected in this experiment is
a non-rational design method, which can carry out directed
evolution and selection of the coding genes of enzyme molecules,
thereby improving the stability of the enzyme and the speciﬁcity
of the substrate. It is an important research tool to the
current protein engineering. The in vitro molecular directed
evolution technology based on error-prone PCR can produce
large phenotypic diﬀerences through minimal sequence changes,
and target strains can be screened out, which simpliﬁes the
comparative analysis of sequences to a great extent. However,
because error-prone PCR can only mutate a small sequence in the
original protein, it is generally suitable for smaller gene fragments
(<2,000 bp) (Wang et al., 2017).
In this study, a laccase gene lac1338 from the marine microbial
metagenome was synthesized by a codon optimization for E. coli
expression. Then the laccase rlac1338 with high expression andthermal stability was obtained through prokaryotic expression.
The laccase can degrade various dyes, but due to its low enzymatic
activity than comparable bacterial or fungal laccases, the dye
degradation rates are also low, which limits its application
to a certain extent. Therefore, we modiﬁed the lac1338 gene
by an error-prone PCR directed evolution strategy, and used
enzyme activity as a screening indicator to obtain mutant strains
with increased laccase activity. By comparing the optimum
temperature and temperature stability, optimum pH and pH
stability, enzymatic kinetics, and dye degradation rate between
the recombinase and the mutant enzyme, we have determined
that error-prone PCR modiﬁcation of laccase is a feasible
method. Further explore its application prospects in industrial
dye processing, and provide a certain foundation for its suitability
for industrial applications.

III sites of the expression vector pET-32a(C), the recombinant
plasmid was obtained and veriﬁed by double enzyme digestion.
The recombinant plasmid pET-32a-lac1338 was transformed into
E. coli BL21(DE3) and placed under shaking culture at 37C
and 200 rpm/min until the OD 600reached about 0.8. After that,
(Isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside), and 0.5 mmol/L Cu2C
(ﬁnal concentrations) were added, followed by incubation at
30C and 200 rpm/min under shaking for 16 h to induce protein
expression, centrifuge the bacteria to collect the precipitate and
ultrasonically break it. Referred to the instruction of HisBindR
Puriﬁcation Kit (Novagen) for protein puriﬁcation and SDS-
PAGE analysis. With bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the
standard, the puriﬁed protein concentration was determined
using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method (Brown et al., 1989).
Directed Evolution of lac1338
With lac1338 as the template, error-prone PCR was performed
according to the instruction of the DiversifyRPCR random
mutagenesis kit. A mutation rate of 2.3 bp/kb was selected, and
the reaction system was: 10 TITANIUM Taq Buﬀer 5 ml;
50Diversify dNTP Mix 1 ml; Template DNA (1 ng/ml) 1 ml;
Mut-F (250 ng/ml) 1 ml; Mut-R (250 ng/ml) 1 ml; TITANIUM
Taq Polym 1 ml; MnSO4 1 ml; dGTP (2 mM) 1 ml; PCR Grade
Water 39 ml. The reaction conditions were: 94C 30 s; 94C
30 s, 68C 90 s, 25 cycles; 72C 5 min. The error-prone PCR
product was cloned and constructed into E. coli BL21 (DE3)
and the mutants with the highest enzyme activity were selected
for experimental research through preliminary screening and
re-screening of highly active laccase mutants. Among them,
the initial screening was through the ABTS color reaction, and
the enzyme activity was judged according to the color depth;
the second screening was to identify whether the size of the
mutant laccase was consistent with the size of the recombinant
laccase by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis, and then selected by
the enzyme activity determination method the mutant enzyme
with the highest enzyme activity (Feng and Li, 2015).
Activity Determination and Enzymatic
Properties of Recombinant Laccase
rlac1338 and Mutant Strain lac2-9
Enzyme Activity Determination
With ABTS as the substrate, the reaction system of 3 mL citric
acid-sodium citrate buﬀer solution contains 5 mmol/L ABTS,
6 mmol/L Cu2Cand a certain concentration of the enzyme
solution. After uniform mixing, the sample system reacted in a
water bath at 55C for 3 min, followed by measurement of OD 405,
measured three times in parallel and repeated the experiment
three times. A blank control was prepared without adding the
enzyme solution. Under these conditions, the amount of enzyme
required to catalyze the oxidation of 1 mmol ABTS per minute
was deﬁned as 1 enzyme activity unit (U).
Determination of Optimal Reaction Conditions and
Stability Analysis
The optimal reaction temperature was determined by measuring
the enzyme activity from 30 to 70C (5C interval). Theoptimal reaction pH of the enzyme was identiﬁed within pH
4–10 (Britton-Robinson buﬀer solution). To determine the
thermostability of the enzyme, its activity under the optimum pH
was measured from 35 to 80C (5C interval) for 2 h. The enzyme
activity of the enzyme solution stored at 4C was considered as
100%. To evaluate the pH stability of the enzyme, the activity at
the optimum temperature was measured after 4 h of incubation
at pH of 4–8. The activity of the untreated enzyme solution
was taken as 100%.
Determination of Kinetic Parameters of Enzymatic
Reaction of Recombinant Laccase rlac1338 and
Mutant Strain lac2-9
The Michaelis constant K mand the maximum rate V max were
determined:
Diﬀerent common substrates of laccase were selected (2,6-
DMP , ABTS, Guaiacol, Catecho, 1-naphthol) to react. The OD 405
was determined to calculate the initial speed of the enzyme
reaction and plot a Lineweaver-Burk double reciprocal graph.
Comparison of Dye Degradation by
rlac1338 and lac2-9
The eﬀects of rlac1338 and mutant enzyme lac2-9 on the
degradation of various industrial dyes (amaranth, isatin,
bromophenol blue, acid violet 7, crystal violet, orange red
G, Congo red, rhodamine B, methylene blue and coomassie
brilliant blue G250) were investigated. Inoculated 0.2 mL
of recombinant laccase rlac1338 and mutant enzyme lac2-
9, respectively, in 50 mL of liquid medium, and kept them
at the optimum temperature (55, 60C) and the suitable pH
(6, 6.5), shook overnight at 220 rpm. After 16 h, added the
above industrial dyes to make the ﬁnal concentration of the
dye 100 mg/L. After decolorizing at 37C and 220 rpm for
24 h, the absorbance of each dye solution was determined
at the maximum wavelength of the spectrophotometer. Then
the eﬀects of Ca2Cand ABTS on the degradation rate were
simultaneously investigated.
Degradation rate .I/was calculated as ID
.A0 A1/ =A 0100%;
where A 0: light absorption of the blank control; A 1: light
absorption of a sample dye.
Simulation of the Three-Dimensional
Structure of the Mutant Strain
The amino acid sequence of the target protein was inputted
into PHYRE21to predict structure. The PDB ﬁle was opened
with Pymol, and the mutation site was marked. According to
the predicted structure information, the site mutation eﬀect was
analyzed together with a comparison of enzymatic properties
between the mutant enzyme and the wild-type enzyme.

RESULTS
Recombinant Plasmid Construction and
Protein Expression
The 1,338 bp lac1338 gene was ampliﬁed by PCR
(Supplementary Figure 1) and double enzyme digestion
resulted in two bands of 1,338 and 5,900 bp (Supplementary
Figure 2), respectively, which were the target gene and the empty
linear plasmid pET-32a(C), which proved that the target gene
was successfully ligated to the expression vector. SDS-PAGE
showed that the rlac1338 was a single band with a molecular
weight of68 kD (18 kD was the fusion protein tag on the
expression vector) (Supplementary Figure 3), which was the
same as the theoretically predicted protein molecular weight.
The puriﬁed protein concentration measured by the BCA
method was 0.25 g/L.
Directed Evolution of rlac1338
Error-Prone PCR to Generate Mutant Laccase Gene
and Construction of Mutant Library
Using mutant primers Mut-F and Mut-R, a mutant gene fragment
with Hind III and BamHI restriction sites was ampliﬁed, the size
was about 1.3 kbp, and the target strip was recovered by 1%
agarose gel electrophoresis band. Randomly picked clones and
extracted plasmids for double enzyme digestion, and subjected
the digested products to gel electrophoresis analysis. According
to statistics, the number of clones in the library can reach 108,
which meet the requirements of library screening.
Primary Screening of Highly Active Laccase Mutants
After being cultured, the positive transformants were developed
with ABTS, and the enzyme activity was judged by the intensity
of the color, that is, the darker the color, the higher the enzyme
activity (Supplementary Figure 4). The results showed that
about 40% of the mutants had no color change or lighter
color than the wild-type laccase, about 40% of the activity was
basically unchanged, and only about 20% of the mutants had an
increase in activity. It can be seen that the mutations aﬀected the
laccase enzyme active.
Rescreening of Highly Active Laccase Mutants
The mutants with higher activity obtained in the preliminary
screening were identiﬁed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, and the
results showed that the size of the laccase protein produced by the
mutants was similar to that of the rlac1338 (Figure 1).
Mutant Gene Sequence Sequencing
The strains with higher enzyme activity than the wild type were
obtained by functional screening (Xia et al., 2014; Lv et al.,
2015), which were named lac1-16, lac1-19, lac2-1, and lac2-9
after sequencing (Table 1). Obviously, the enzyme activity of the
mutant strain lac2-9 was signiﬁcantly improved.
Properties of Enzymes
The optimal reaction temperature of the mutant enzyme was 5C
higher than that of rlac1338 (60 vs. 55C) (Figure 2). The thermal
stability was also improved, and the relative enzyme activity was

results of pH and pH stability were shown in Figure 3. With
ABTS as the reaction substrate, the mutant strain had a pH
increase of 0.5 unit compared with the recombinant laccase, but
its stability was not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent.

that ABTS is the most suitable substrate for the recombinant
enzyme and mutant enzyme. In addition, the K mof the mutant
strain lac2-9 (76 mM) was signiﬁcantly lower, but the k cat/Km
(0.618 s 1M 1) was signiﬁcantly higher, and the speciﬁc enzyme
activity (79.8 U/mg) increased by 3.5 times compared with the
recombinant laccase (22.8 U/mg), the speciﬁc enzyme activity
to other substrates also improved to diﬀerent degrees compared
with the recombinant laccase.
Comparison of Dye Degradation by
lac2-9 and rlac1338
Compared with the recombinant laccase and rlac1338, the
degradation rates with the simultaneous addition of Ca2CandABTS of mutant strain lac2-9 over acid violet 7, bromophenol
blue, coomassie brilliant blue and amaranth increased from
10.9, 20, 25, and 13.7 to 90.5, 67.8, 85, and 14.5%, respectively
(Figure 4). Hence, it is feasible to obtain functionally enhanced
mutant enzymes through error-prone PCR.

DISCUSSION
The gene encoding codon optimized lac1338 was synthesized.
The biggest advantage of this method is that the protein can be
expressed at a high level. The optimum reaction temperature
of most fungal laccases discovered so far is between 25 and
50C. Zhao (2012) screened a white rot fungus with high
laccase production, the optimum temperature of the laccase
produced by the bacteria is 30C. However, bacterial laccase
generally has a relatively high optimal reaction temperature.
Li et al. (2020) selected a strain of laccase from Bacillus
thuringiensis that produces a high-temperature laccase, and
its optimal temperature is 75C. The optimum temperatureof the laccase synthesized in this experiment is 55C, and
the optimum temperature of lac2-9 is 60C. Although it is
lower than some bacterial laccases, it is also higher than
most fungal laccases. This may be an advantage for the
application of this laccase in industrial production in high
temperature environment.
At present, directed evolution methods mainly include error-
prone PCR, DNA shuﬄing, random in vitro recombination,
and staggered extension (Wang et al., 2017). Directed evolution
technology belongs to the category of non-rational design. It does
not need to know the three-dimensional structure information
and mechanism of protein in advance. Instead, it creates a process
similar to natural evolution in vitro, causes a large number of
mutations in genes, and then selects the required ones through
speciﬁc screening methods. The nature or function of the target
gene. In particular, it has certain advantages in modifying the
enzymatic properties of enzymes, such as improving the thermal
stability of the enzyme, expanding the range of substrates,
making the optimal reaction pH more acidic or alkaline, and
improving enzyme activity. Directed evolution is usually divided
into three steps: the ﬁrst step is to generate diverse genes
through random mutation or in vitro recombination; the second
step is to construct a mutation library after the mutated gene
is introduced into an appropriate vector; the third step is to
select by appropriate screening methods Mutants of desired
properties. The whole process can be cycled many times until
the enzyme with the desired properties is obtained. The error-
prone PCR technology selected in this study is a relatively simple
and fast random mutation strategy that only needs to change a
single condition to produce greater mutation beneﬁts. After the
mutation library is constructed, the choice of an eﬃcient and
sensitive screening method is the success of directed evolution
to transform the protein molecule. According to laboratory
conditions, by simulating the activity screening method of 96-
well plates, the apparent enzyme activity of the mutants is
preliminarily determined based on the color reaction of the
substrate, that is, the faster the color reaction speed and the
darker the color, the higher the corresponding mutant laccase
enzyme activity; the detection of enzyme activity in the re-
screening process avoids misjudgment and improves the accuracy
and authenticity of the screening results. Explore the amino
acids that aﬀect enzyme activity and stability through the three-
dimensional structure, and the results show that in the mutation
sites of the mutant enzyme lac2-9, positions 281 and 309 were
replaced by non-polar amino acids with polar amino acids, and
position 318 was mutated from the neutral amino acid serine
to the non-polar amino acid glycine. These positions may be
involved in maintaining the spatial conformation required for
laccase catalytic oxidation. The mutation at position 232 from the
polar positively charged aspartic acid to the non-polar amino acid
valine improves the surface hydrophobic eﬀect on the mutant
enzyme molecule, making it more suitable for binding to the
substrate at high temperatures (Autore et al., 2009), and aﬀects
the combination of T2/T3 copper trinuclear active center and
hydroxide radical, so that the optimal pH changes (Madzak et al.,
2006). Therefore, the mutation at this site improves the optimum
temperature and stability of the mutant enzyme.

Dai et al. Laccase’s Efﬁciency on Dye Degradation
Studies show that the mutant enzyme has improved
dye degradation types and degradation rates compared to
the recombinant laccase rlac1338, indicating that it directed
evolution is feasible for obtaining a mutant enzyme with more
industrial application value. Miele et al. (2010) improved the
enzyme activity of Pleurotus ostreatus laccase POXA1b by
directed evolution, which increased the degradation rates of acid
yellow 49, acid red 266 and direct yellow 106. By increasing the
enzymatic activity of the laccase CotA of Bacillus licheniformis,
Koschorreck et al. (2009) enhanced the degradation eﬀects of
the laccase on the dyes such as alizarin red S, brilliant blue
R, and isatin. But laccase can only degrade phenolic dyes, but
cannot directly oxidize non-phenolic dyes. Studies have found
that after adding some small molecule compounds called laccase
mediators, it can promote the catalytic eﬀect of laccase on non-
phenolic substrates, and can signiﬁcantly improve the catalytic
eﬃciency of phenolic substrates, thereby further expanding
laccase the scope of the substrate. These mediators themselves are
also laccase substrates, acting as electron transfer intermediates,
allowing electrons to be transferred between the enzyme and
the substrate. At present, the most commonly used synthetic
mediator is 2,2-azide-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazole-6-sulfonic acid)
(ABTS). Laccases from various sources can quickly oxidize ABTS
to ABTSCintermediate body, and then oxidize the substrate.
ABTS can enhance the dye degradation eﬃciency of laccase,
and mediate the oxidation between laccase and non-enzymatic
substrate dyes, so that laccase can degrade the dyes of non-laccase
substrates (Singh and Kumar, 2010). For example, azo dyes are
not the substrates of laccase, and cannot be directly degraded by
most laccases (Camarero et al., 2005). Nevertheless, rlac1338 can
completely degrade the azo dye rhodamine under the synergistic
eﬀect of ABTS and Ca2C. Laccase lac1338 has a pI of 5.05, and its
optimum pH is 6.0, so the laccase protein has a positive charge.
Ca2Cis a positive ion, which binds to the dye anion, which
reduces the charge repulsion between the laccase protein and the
dye ion, and improves the rate at which the enzyme adsorbs thedye molecules (Sheng, 2019). In the next work, we will combine
the three-dimensional structure of the laccase protein and its
bioinformatics to further explore the reasons why the mutant
base changes its properties.
