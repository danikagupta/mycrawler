Aspergillus lentulus was described in 2005 as a new species within the A. fumigatus sensu lato complex. It is an opportunistic
human pathogen causing invasive aspergillosis with high mortality rates, and it has been isolated from clinical and environmen-tal sources. The species is morphologically nearly identical to A.fumigatus sensu stricto, and this similarity has resulted in their
frequent misidentiﬁcation. Comparative studies show that A. lentulus has some distinguishing growth features and decreased in
vitro susceptibility to several antifungal agents, including amphotericin B and caspofungin. Similar to the once-presumed-asex-
ualA.fumigatus , it has only been known to reproduce mitotically. However, we now show that A.lentulus has a heterothallic
sexual breeding system. A PCR-based mating-type diagnostic detected isolates of either the MAT1-1 orMAT1-2 genotype, and
examination of 26 worldwide clinical and environmental isolates revealed similar ratios of the two mating types (38% versus62%, respectively). MAT1-1 andMAT1-2 idiomorph regions were analyzed, revealing the presence of characteristic alpha and
high-mobility-group (HMG) domain genes, together with other more unusual features such as a MAT1-2-4 gene. We then dem-
onstrated that A. lentulus possesses a functional sexual cycle with mature cleistothecia, containing heat-resistant ascospores,
being produced after 3 weeks of incubation. Recombination was conﬁrmed using molecular markers. However, isolates of A.
lentulus failed to cross with highly fertile strains of A. fumigatus , demonstrating reproductive isolation between these sibling
species. The discovery of the A.lentulus sexual stage has signiﬁcant implications for the management of drug resistance and con-
trol of invasive aspergillosis associated with this emerging fungal pathogen.
Aspergillus lentulus is an opportunistic human pathogenic fun-
gus from the Aspergillus section Fumigati (1) that can cause
invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients ( 2). It was
ﬁrst discovered in 2004, as an unexpected result from a U.S. studyexamining the susceptibility of isolates of A.fumigatus to azole
antifungal drugs ( 3). Four A.lentulus isolates that caused fatal
infections in hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients betweenthe years 1995 and 2000 had been misidentiﬁed as poorly sporu-lating variants of A.fumigatus because their 18S rRNA sequences
matched that of A.fumigatus . However, all of the isolates had
distinct random ampliﬁed polymorphic DNA (RAPD) ﬁngerprintpatterns and mitochondrial cytochrome bsequences, and several
exhibited in vitro antifungal susceptibility proﬁles with signiﬁ-
cantly higher resistance than normal for A.fumigatus . A follow-up
study examined the phylogenetic relationships of these isolates toA.fumigatus using multilocus sequence typing ( 2). The analysis
revealed that the four isolates formed a separate clade clearly dis-
tant from A.fumigatus , and it was concluded that these repre-
sented a new species, which was named A.lentulus (2). A subse-
quent phylogenetic study of Japanese clinical isolates showed thatalong with A.fumisynnematus ,A.lentulus forms a sister clade to A.
fumigatus (4).
Similar to other members of the section Fumigati that are
closely related to A. fumigatus , such as A.fumigatiafﬁnis , many of
the phenotypic characters of A.lentulus overlap with A.fumigatus .
This makes identiﬁcation difﬁcult when based solely on morpho-logical grounds, which often leads to misdiagnoses in clinical lab-oratories ( 5). However, a variety of methods have since been
found that can differentiate between the two species. Phenotypicdissimilarities include their conidial ornamentation ( 4), conidio-
phore architecture, growth characteristics ( 1), and mycotoxin
proﬁles—most notably the inability of A.lentulus to produce glio-toxin ( 1,6). The most obvious growth characteristics that distin-
guish A.lentulus from A. fumigatus are its delayed onset of sporu-
lation and inability to grow at 48°C, although it should be notedthat these two features are common to several other species in the
section Fumigati (7). Species-speciﬁc molecular methods are also
available to identify A.lentulus and include the use of a micro-
sphere-based Luminex assay ( 8), RAPD patterns ( 1), a multiplex
PCR assay ( 9), and restriction fragment length polymorphisms
(10).
Despite the wide geographic distribution and presence of the
species in common environmental niches ( 3–5,7,11–13), oppor-
tunistic A.lentulus infections appear rare. To date, only six studies
have reported cases of invasive aspergillosis in which A.lentulus
was conﬁrmed as the probable or causal agent ( 3,11,12,14–16).
Two further cases involved the colonization of cystic ﬁbrosis pa-tients ( 13,17). This apparent low incidence rate may be due to the
misidentiﬁcation problems described previously ( 5), because A.
lentulus isolates have been recovered in several retrospective stud-
ies of clinical fungal samples ( 4,7).

962 ec.asm.org Eukaryotic Cell p. 962–969 July 2013 Volume 12 Number 7pears to mirror that of A.fumigatus (3). However, of medical
signiﬁcance is the fact that most isolates exhibit an increased nat-ural resistance to several antifungal agents currently in clinical usecompared to A.fumigatus , namely, itraconazole, voriconazole,
caspofungin, and amphotericin B ( 3,4,7). The molecular mech-
anisms underlying these resistance mechanisms have recentlystarted to be elucidated ( 18,19), but further work is required to
fully understand the genetic basis of resistance. Of particular in-terest are the mechanisms governing echinocandin resistance, asA.lentulus is highly unusual in being simultaneously resistant to
caspofungin yet highly sensitive to anidulafungin and micafungin(7,19,20). The discovery of A.lentulus has also proven beneﬁcial
to industry, as an A.lentulus isolate has been found with activity as
a biosorbent for the removal of toxic compounds. A.lentulus
strain AML05, which was recovered from industrial textile efﬂu-ent in India by a chromium enrichment process, can very success-fully remove Cr(VI) from electroplating industry efﬂuent ( 21,22)
and dyes from textile efﬂuent ( 23,24).
A. lentulus is currently known to reproduce only by asexual
means, through the production of conidia ( 2). Hong and cowork-
ers (1) previously tried unsuccessfully to mate strains of A.lentu-
lus, but crucially, this was before recent reports of the discovery of
a sexual cycle in A.fumigatus (teleomorph Neosartorya fumigata )
(25) and other related Aspergillus and Penicillium species which
were previously considered asexual ( 26–31). In most of these
cases, the discovery of a sexual state was preceded by the identiﬁ-cation of mating-type ( MAT ) genes within the species, such genes
acting as key regulators of sexual identity in ﬁlamentous ascomy-cete fungi ( 32,33). In heterothallic (obligate outbreeding) species,
these MAT genes are contained within a region of the genome
termed the MAT locus, with highly divergent forms of this locus,
known as “idiomorphs,” present in isolates of sexually compatibleMAT1-1 and MAT1-2 genotypes. In contrast, homothallic (self-
fertile) species may contain one or more MAT loci within the same
genome rather than dissimilar idiomorphs ( 33,34).
The close phylogenetic relationship of A.lentulus toA.fumiga-
tussuggested that it might be possible to induce sexual reproduc-
tion in A.lentulus using conditions similar to those required for A.
fumigatus . The aims of this study were, therefore, ﬁrst, to investi-
gate the presence of MAT genes in A. lentulus to see if isolates with
putative sexual compatibility could be identiﬁed; second, to de-termine if a sexual cycle could be induced in A.lentulus ; third, to
use molecular analysis of offspring to determine if the breedingsystem was heterothallic or homothallic in nature; and, ﬁnally, tosee if any gene ﬂow was possible between A. lentulus and A. fu-
migatus via sexual crossing. The ability to perform sexual crosses
inA. lentulus would provide a valuable tool for the genetic analysis
of traits relating to pathogenicity, antifungal drug resistance, andindustrial processes in this species.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Strains, growth conditions, and DNA extraction. Twenty-six isolates of
A.lentulus from clinical and environmental sources were used in the
study, comprising most isolates of the species previously reported in thescientiﬁc literature (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). Sixteen ofthe clinical isolates were kindly donated by Kieren Marr and EdmondByrnes (John Hopkins School of Medicine, Maryland). Strains weremaintained on Aspergillus complete medium (ACM) ( 35) at 28°C and are
stored in 10% glycerol under liquid nitrogen at the School of Biology,University of Nottingham, United Kingdom (BDUN [Botany Depart-ment, University of Nottingham] culture collection). Genomic DNA wasextracted using a DNeasy plant minikit (Qiagen) in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions. Cultures were grown in liquid ACM at 28°Cfor 5 days. The resulting mycelia were harvested, ﬂash frozen, and groundunder liquid nitrogen prior to DNA extraction.
Multiplex mating-type PCR assay and PCR ampliﬁcation of the mat-
ing-type idiomorphs. The mating-type genotype of all A. lentulus isolates
and ascospore progeny was determined with the A. fumigatus multiplex
mating-type PCR diagnostic of Paoletti et al. ( 35), using primers AFM1,
AFM2, and AFM3 (see Table S2 in the supplemental material). Attemptswere then made to amplify the entire MAT idiomorph regions of A. len-
tulus isolates 78-2 and 78-3 with the primer pair Loc1 and AFM3 (see
Table S2) using the conditions described by Paoletti et al. ( 35); these
primers had previously been used to successfully amplify the idiomorphregions of A. fumigatus (35). Resulting amplicons were puriﬁed using a
Geneﬂow Q-Spin PCR puriﬁcation kit (according to the manufacturer’sinstructions) and were sequenced using primers AL31-AL34 and AL51-AL53 (see Table S2) at the DNA Sequencing Facility of the School ofBiomedical Sciences, University of Nottingham, United Kingdom. Aris-ing sequences were analyzed and aligned using MacVector 11 (MacVectorInc.).
Sexual crosses. Sixteen representative A. lentulus isolates of MAT1-1
and MAT1-2 genotype (see Table S1 in the supplemental material) were
chosen for sexual crossing experiments and inoculated in all possible pair-wise combinations by following the protocol of O’Gorman et al. ( 25).
Brieﬂy, crosses were set up on oatmeal agar (pinhead oatmeal, Od-
lums, Ireland [ 36]) in triplicate, sealed with one layer of Nescoﬁlm,
and incubated at 25, 28, or 30°C in the dark. Four A.fumigatus crosses
known to reliably produce cleistothecia and ascospores (AfRB2 /H11003
AfIR928, AfRB2 /H11003AfIR964, AfIR974 /H11003AfIR928, and AfIR974 /H11003
AfIR964) ( 25) were set up in parallel as controls. Control “selfed” A.
lentulus crosses were also tested on oatmeal agar at 28°C using one
representative isolate of each mating type (78-2 [ MAT1-2 ] and 78-3
[MAT1-1 ]). In addition, crosses were set up on oatmeal agar at 28°C
and 30°C between representative A. lentulus MAT1-1 (78-3, 78-6, and
78-20) and MAT1-2 (78-2 and 78-8) isolates (see Table S1 in the sup-
plemental material) and known highly fertile isolates of A. fumigatus
(AFB62 [ MAT1-1 ] and AfIR928 [ MAT1-2 ]) (37) to assess reproduc-
tive isolation. All crosses were examined periodically for the presenceof cleistothecia for up to 7 weeks using a Nikon-SMZ-2B dissectionmicroscope and then, ﬁnally, after 4 and 12 months of incubationwhere cleistothecia were not detected in the initial growth period.
Preparation of single-ascospore cultures. Mature cleistothecia from
the cross 78-2 /H1100378-3 were removed and cleaned as described previously
(25), with the modiﬁcation that 4% water agar was used to clean the
cleistothecia instead of a drop of sterile water. Five cleistothecia wereadded to 50 /H9262l of 0.05% Tween 80 (BDH Chemicals) under sterile condi-
tions and ruptured by squashing with a needle tip. The solution wasbrought up to 500 /H9262l with 0.05% Tween 80 and vortex mixed for 1 min to
release the ascospores. The suspension was then heat treated at 80°C for 30min, this temperature being sufﬁcient to kill any contaminating conidiawithout damaging the ascospores (data not shown). One hundred micro-liters of a 5 /H1100310
5-ascospore ml/H110021heat-treated suspension was spread
inoculated on three deﬁned areas of an ACM plate. Triplicates were pre-
pared and incubated at 37°C for 14 h. Single-spore cultures were estab-lished on ACM by transferring individual germinating ascospores with aLaRue lens cutter attached to a Nikon-Optiphot microscope.
Analysis of recombination. The segregation of ﬁve genetic markers
(four RAPD bands and the mating-type genotype) in the ascospore prog-eny was examined for evidence of recombination. RAPD-PCR ﬁnger-printing was performed by following the protocol of O’Gorman et al. ( 25).
Four primers (OMT1, R108, R151, and OPWO8 [see Table S2 in thesupplemental material]) from an initial screen of 12 were found to yieldsuitable polymorphisms for genotyping.
SEM. Cleistothecia were collected from 6-month-old crosses of 78-
2/H1100378-3 that had been incubated at 28°C. Representative intact andSex in Aspergillus lentulus
July 2013 Volume 12 Number 7 ec.asm.org 963crushed cleistothecia were transferred onto 0.2- /H9262m ﬁlter discs (What-
man) and ﬁxed in 2% osmium tetroxide (Sigma) fo r2ha t room temper-
ature. The ﬁxed samples were then mounted onto aluminum stubs, driedat 37°C overnight, and sputter coated with gold. Scanning electron mi-croscopy (SEM) micrographs were taken using a JSM-840 JEOL scanningelectron microscope.
Statistical analysis. The hypothesis of a 1:1 ratio of mating types in the
worldwide sample population and ascospore progeny was tested using /H9273
2
and contingency /H92732tests. Where expected frequencies were /H110215, Fisher’s
exact test was used instead ( 38).
Accession numbers. The sequences for the two mating-type loci am-
pliﬁed from isolates 78-3 ( MAT1-1 ) and 78-2 ( MAT1-2 ) have been de-
posited in GenBank under accession numbers KC876046 andKC876047 .
The diagnosis of the Aspergillus lentulus (neosartorya-morph) has been
deposited in MycoBank under accession number MB356679 (see the sup-
plemental material).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Sex is thought to have evolved in early eukaryotic microbes and is
now widespread throughout the Eukaryota ( 39). The ability to
undergo sexual reproduction is considered to be of major impor-tance given the many beneﬁts it confers. These include the poten-tial to purge harmful mutations and improve the ﬁtness of off-spring, which, in turns, allows them to better resist adverseenvironmental conditions ( 40–43). It is therefore surprising that
the kingdom Fungi appears to contain a disproportionally largenumber of supposedly asexual species, with an estimated 20%having no known sexual stage. Many are members of the phylumAscomycota that are of medical or economic signiﬁcance ( 44).
Some, such as A.oryzae , have been shown to possess MAT genes
and other “sexual machinery,” yet their sexual cycle remains elu-sive ( 45). While there are clear advantages to asexual over sexual
reproduction, such as the relatively lower metabolic cost and abil-ity to produce spores under a wider range of environmental con-ditions, the rewards of sexual reproduction appear to be muchgreater ( 46).
The discovery of a heterothallic sexual cycle in A.fumigatus ,
which had long been considered to be reproduce purely by mitoticmeans, conﬁrmed suspicions that at least some of these supposed“asexuals” do in fact have the potential to reproduce sexually ( 25,
43). Signiﬁcantly, a “sexual revolution” has since followed, withthe reporting of functional sexual cycles in several other related
ﬁlamentous fungi ( 26–31,47). The aim of this work was to deter-
mine whether it was possible to induce a sexual cycle in A.lentulus ,
given its close phylogenetic relationship to A.fumigatus (1) and its
increasing importance as a human pathogen with resistance todrugs in several antifungal classes relative to A.fumigatus (2).
Presence, distribution, and characterization of the MAT
idiomorphs. The A.lentulus genome was ﬁrst examined for the
presence of the master regulatory MAT genes that are transcrip-
tion factors common to all heterothallic fungi and which deter-mine cell sexual identity ( 32). It was found that the previously
described multiplex PCR mating type diagnostic for A.fumigatus
(35) produced corresponding amplicons of the predicted size (ca.
834 bp for MAT1-1 and 438 bp for MAT1-2 ) in different isolates of
A. lentulus (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). This indi-
cated a heterothallic (obligate outcrossing) arrangement in thespecies and conﬁrmed the phylogenetic afﬁnity with A. fumigatus ,
given that this was designed as a species-speciﬁc diagnostic test.The worldwide collection of A. lentulus isolates was then screened
to determine the ratio of complementary MAT1-1 and MAT1-2
genotypes (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). Ampliconswere generated for all isolates, and the overall mating-type distri-bution did not deviate signiﬁcantly from a 1:1 ratio (38.5%MAT1-1 and 61.5% MAT1-2 ;/H9273
2/H110051.38; n/H1100526), consistent with
a sexually reproducing species. When isolates were grouped ac-
cording to geographic origin, there was also no signiﬁcant differ-ence in the MAT distribution (data not shown).
It was then found that the entire MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 id-
iomorph regions of A. lentulus could be ampliﬁed using the prim-
ers Loc1 and AMF3, which had previously been used to amplifyMAT regions from A. fumigatus (35). This yielded amplicons of
2,524 and 2,731 bp, respectively. Figure 1 shows the complete
sequenced idiomorph structure of the two mating-type loci am-pliﬁed from isolates 78-3 ( MAT1-1 ) and 78-2 ( MAT1-2 ). The
idiomorphs showed the same overall structural organization asthose previously reported from A. fumigatus (35). The MAT1-1
idiomorph of 78-3 contains a 1,157-bp putative open readingframe (ORF), predicted to encode a 368-amino-acid protein with
a characteristic /H92511 domain, and was therefore termed MAT1-1-1
FIG 1 MAT locus of Aspergillus lentulus . The arrangement of the A.lentulus idiomorph region shows the difference in organization between isolates 78-3
(MAT1-1 ) and 78-2 ( MAT1-2 ). Colored block arrows indicate MAT1-1-1 (red), MAT1-2-1 (green), and MAT1-2-4 (white) sequences. Colored boxes indicate
the/H92511 domain (salmon pink), HMG domain (light green), and nearly identical ﬂanking regions (gray). Introns are represented by black boxes; lines extendi ng
between boxes and arrows represent idiomorph sequence. Smaller red and green segments represent regions between 10 and 29 bp in length with /H1135070%
MAT1-1-1 and MAT1-2-1 nucleotide conservation, respectively. Black arrowheads (direction indicates 5 =to 3 =sequence) show the positions of primers (see
Table S2 in the supplemental material) used for ampliﬁcation of the idiomorph region.Swilaiman et al.
964 ec.asm.org Eukaryotic Cell(33). The ORF is interrupted by a 50-bp intron in the conserved
position found in other ascomycetes, and the overall protein and/H92511 domain region share 93% and 98% amino acid identity to A.
fumigatus , respectively (see Fig. S2A in the supplemental mate-
rial). The MAT1-2 idiomorph of 78-2 contains two putative ORFs.
The ﬁrst is a 1,077-bp ORF predicted to encode a 322-amino-acidprotein with a characteristic high-mobility-group (HMG) box,which was therefore termed MAT1-2-1 (33). This ORF contains
two introns (53 and 55 bp), and the overall protein and HMGdomain share 89% and 92% amino acid identity to A.fumigatus ,
respectively (see Fig. S2B). The second is a putative ORF of 903 bpwith three introns (46, 46, and 58 bp), predicted to encode a 242-amino-acid product which was found to share 95% and 87%amino acid identity to the putative MAT1-2-4 proteins from A.
fumigatus andNeosartorya ﬁscheri , respectively (see Fig. S2C) ( 48,
49; C. Eagle and P. S. Dyer, unpublished data). A related MAT1-
2-4family gene has also been described for Talaromyces (Penicil-
lium )marneffei (50). However, similar MAT1-2-4 genes are ab-
sent from many other aspergilli, and their expression and possiblefunctionality remain to be determined. A MAT1-2-4 gene has also
been reported for Coccidioides immitis and C. posadasii (51,52),
but this shares little sequence conservation with the MAT1-2-4proteins from the aspergilli and is absent from the MAT loci of
many other heterothallic eurotiomycete species, such as those re-cently described for Blastomyces dermatitidis (53).
Similar to the previous report for A. fumigatus (35), although
theMAT1-2-1 gene commenced within the MAT1-2 idiomorph, a
terminal 374-bp region was found to lie within the ﬂanking se-quence bordering both idiomorphs ( Fig. 1 ). However, the frag-
ment bordering the MAT1-1 idiomorph appeared nonfunctional,
as it lacked the HMG domain region and any start codon andcontained a deletion, giving rise to a frameshift mutation. There-fore, the fragment was termed dMAT1-1-1 in recognition of the
disabled ORF ( 48). Intriguingly, further analysis of the MAT1-1
idiomorph revealed an additional 14 regions between 10 and 15 bpin length with /H1135070% nucleotide conservation compared to the A.
lentulus MAT1-2-1 gene. These extended directly upstream from
the 374-bp dMAT1-2-1 fragment, with seven of the regions pres-
ent within the predicted HMG domain ( Fig. 1 ). Similarly, further
analysis of the MAT1-2 idiomorph revealed 18 regions between 10
and 29 bp in length within the idiomorph which exhibited /H1135070%nucleotide conservation compared to A.lentulus MAT1-1-1 gene,
including 13 within the MAT1-2-4 gene itself ( Fig. 1 ). These data
indicate a complex evolutionary history for the idiomorphs, pos-sibly signifying the presence of an ancestral homothallic MAT lo-
cus containing both MAT1-1-1 and MAT1-2-1 genes, which has
since undergone accelerated mutation and evolution in the tran-sition to heterothallism ( 54). It has been suggested that homothal-
lism might be the ancestral state within the Aspergillus section
Fumigati , with the overwhelming majority of teleomorphic Neo-
sartorya species exhibiting homothallic breeding systems ( 55,56).
It can also be speculated that the MAT1-2-4 gene, whose origins
are obscure, might have arisen from sequence derived from theMAT1-1-1 gene.
Sexual crosses. Crosses were set up between isolates of com-
plementary mating type using the conditions that had successfullyinduced sex in A.fumigatus (25), with one modiﬁcation. Both
25°C and 28°C were tested in addition to the 30°C required for A.
fumigatus mating, given that A.lentulus has a lower growth tem-
perature range than A. fumigatus (1). Nine isolates of clinical and
environmental origin from North America and Asia (see Table S1in the supplemental material) were crossed in all pairwise combi-nations ( Table 1 ). Signiﬁcantly, after 3 weeks of incubation at both
28°C and 30°C, certain crosses were found to be fertile, producingcleistothecia that contained viable ascospores ( Table 1 andFig. 2 ;
see supplemental material for species diagnosis). In contrast, nocleistothecia were observed in crosses incubated at 25°C. Cleis-tothecia also failed to develop on single MAT cultures, indicating
that A.lentulus is a heterothallic species.
In crosses where cleistothecia were produced, they formedTABLE 1 Mean numbers of cleistothecia produced by 14 Aspergillus

(Fig. 2A ) and were pale yellow-orange in color ( Fig. 2B ). All
crosses forming cleistothecia produced viable ascospores. The as-cospores were heat resistant ( 57), capable of surviving at 80°C for
at least 30 min, as is typical for other members of the genus Neo-
sartorya (56). This might reﬂect selection in a common ancestor of
Neosartorya for survival in ecological niches where high tem-
peratures might be encountered, such as composting vegeta-tion ( 58). Ascospore progeny from a cross between isolates
78-2 and 78-3 were then assessed for evidence of recombina-tion. Distinct segregation patterns were clearly observed be-tween four RAPD-PCR markers and the MAT genotype in 12
ascospore progeny, with Fisher’s exact test conﬁrming 1:1Mendelian segregation of the markers due to independent as-sortment, conﬁrming a heterothallic sexual breeding system(Table 2 and Fig. 3 ). Unique genotypes were found in 92% of
the progeny, with only one of the offspring identical to itsparent (based on the markers examined).
In accordance with the “One Fungus /H11005One Name” proposal
(59), the newly discovered sexual state (teleomorph) of A.lentulus
will not be assigned a separate Latin name, as was formerly the caseunder “dual nomenclature” ( 60). This follows the recent taxo-
nomic move to simplify the naming of pleomorphic fungi. In thefuture, the teleomorph of A.lentulus should be referred to as A.
lentulus (neosartorya-morph) where appropriate ( 59), given the
phylogenetic link between the teleomorph genus Neosartorya and
theAspergillus section Fumigati (47,56).
As shown in Table 1 , three of the four fertile crosses (fertility is
here deﬁned as the production of cleistothecia with viable asco-spores) yielded sexual offspring at both 28°C and 30°C, suggestingthat A.lentulus may not be as fastidious as A.fumigatus in its
temperature requirement for mating ( 61). Crosses were then re-
incubated for a further 4 weeks and reexamined for the presence ofcleistothecia (see Table S3 in the supplemental material). The lon-ger incubation period resulted in a further 7 and 14% of crossesreaching sexual maturity at 28°C and 30°C, respectively. Thus, atotal of 35% of the crosses were fertile at both temperatures. Asecond series of 20 crosses was then set up at 28°C for 3 weeks totest the fertility of an additional seven isolates (see Table S4 in thesupplemental material). Six of the seven isolates were fertile withat least one mating partner, although overall fertility was still only35%. These results illustrate the importance of having multipleisolates of opposite mating type in close proximity in the environ-ment, to ensure compatibility with at least one complementarystrain.
Finally, crosses were attempted between representative MAT1-1
and MAT1-2 isolates of A. lentulus and highly fertile “supermater”
isolates of A. fumigatus (37). Hyphal aggregations resembling imma-
ture cleistothecia were formed very occasionally in such crosses (seeFig. S3 in the supplemental material). However, despite prolongedincubation, for up to 12 months, at both 28°C and 30°C, these nevermatured to form ascospores. This indicates that the species are truesibling species, being phylogenetically closely related but withoutgene ﬂow via sexual means ( 62). This has important implications for
the evolution of resistance to antifungal drugs in A. fumigatus ,a si t
suggests, fortunately, that transmission of genes conferring such re-sistance is unlikely to occur between A. lentulus andA. fumigatus . This
result is consistent with the phylogenetic divergence reported be-tween the species ( 2,4), although it is cautioned that crosses were
attempted only between a subset of A. lentulus andA. fumigatus iso-
lates. It has also been reported that abortive cleistothecia can be pro-duced in crosses between Neosartorya fennelliae and A. fumigatusTABLE 2 Genotypes of parental isolates and 12 ascospore progeny from

“/H11002” denote presence and absence, respectively, of a particular amplicon. Pvalues (two-
tailed) for OMT1, R108, OPW08, and R151 were 0.06, 0.24, 0.57, and 0.24, respectively.Fisher’s exact test was conducted to check for deviation from the null hypothesis ofindependent assortment of mating-type and RAPD markers in the progeny (i.e., a 1:1:1:1MAT1-1 /H11001:MAT1-1 /H11002:MAT1-2 /H11001:MAT1-2 /H11002ratio for each RAPD marker). Fisher’s
exact test was used instead of the /H9273
2test because the expected frequencies were /H110215. A
contingency /H92732test was conducted to check for deviation from the null hypothesis of
independent assortment of mating-type and RAPD markers in the progeny (i.e., an
overall 1:1:1:1 MAT1-1 /H11001:MAT1-1 /H11002:MAT1-2 /H11001:MAT1-2 /H11002ratio for the sum of the

and RAPD markers as distinct from those of the parental isolates (designated P1 and
P2), is identiﬁed by a different letter of the alphabet.

diagnostic RAPD band. Red and green lane headings indicate MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 genotypes, respectively.Swilaiman et al.
966 ec.asm.org Eukaryotic Cell(63). These crossing results compare with data for some other asco-
mycete species, such as within the genus Neurospora , where interspe-
cies crossing is possible, albeit with reduced fertility and ascosporeviability ( 64,65).
The large variation in fertility of A. lentulus isolates depending
on the mating partner is similar to observations reported for A.
fumigatus by both O’Gorman et al. ( 25) and Sugui et al. ( 37) and
forNeosartorya udagawae by Sugui et al. ( 66). For example, the A.
lentulus cross 78-3 /H1100378-8 produced fewer than 20 cleistothecia
per plate ( Table 1 ). However, when 78-3 was crossed with 78-2 it
was the most fertile pairing at both temperatures, consistentlyproducing /H1135080 cleistothecia per plate ( Table 1 ). The pairing of
78-3/H1100378-2 is therefore recommended for community use. It
should be noted that these two isolates came from agriculturalsoils within 50 mi of each other in the Republic of Korea. Theirsimilar geographic origins may hint at a close genetic relationshipand lack of reproductive barriers, this being one of a variety offactors suggested to inﬂuence fertility of fungal sexual crosses ( 67–
69). Genome relatedness is thought to be an important factor for
fertility, as illustrated for A.fumigatus by the “supermater” pair
(37). These isolates share 99% genome similarity based on a CGH
(comparative genomic hybridization) analysis, and the cross is themost successful A.fumigatus pairing to date.
It is important to note that only 25% of the A. lentulus crosses
at both 28°C and 30°C were fertile after 3 weeks. This ﬁgure isextremely low in comparison to that for A.fumigatus , for which
the study by Sugui et al. ( 37) found that 80% ( n/H1100550) of crosses
were fertile after 4 weeks. O’Gorman et al. ( 25) reported 94% of
their A.fumigatus crosses to be fertile ( n/H1100536), but this was after
6 months of incubation, which can be considered to representmaximum maturity. The large disparity in fertility between A.
lentulus and A.fumigatus is surprising given their nearly identical
MAT idiomorph structures ( Fig. 1 ) and conditions required for
the sexual cycle. It is conceivable that either part or all of the globalA.lentulus population is undergoing a slow decline in fertility
(44). Alternatively, it could suggest a difference in the population
dynamics of the two species due to an unknown underlying fertil-ity or incompatibility mechanism in A.lentulus . Natural A.fu-
migatus populations have been well studied and have yielded evi-
dence of recombination, conﬁrming that sexual reproduction istaking or has recently taken place ( 35,70,71). Similar studies have
yet to be conducted for A.lentulus , for which many fewer isolates
are available for study. Deﬁning its population structure will in-form future studies to determine how widespread sexual repro-duction is in nature and whether the low fertility seen in this studyis representative of the global population.
Conclusions. The discovery of a sexual cycle in A.lentulus is
important both for the biology of the species and for future effortsto control this pathogen. It also shows that yet another supposedlyasexual pathogenic fungus possesses a functional sexual cycle,thereby harboring the potential to evolve rapidly in the face ofselective pressures ( 43). Sexuality in its close relative A.fumigatus
can now be directly compared to that of A.lentulus , and future
studies may shed light on their different evolutionary paths. How-ever, of most signiﬁcance is the fact that the sexual cycle will pro-vide an invaluable tool for classical genetic analysis to facilitate
research into the genetic basis of pathogenicity and drug resistancein this emerging agent of aspergillosis.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
