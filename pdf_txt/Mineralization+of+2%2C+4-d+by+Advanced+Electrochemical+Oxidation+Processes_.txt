Abstract 
Conventional processes for water treatment are inef ficient for the remediation of 
wastewaters containing toxic and biorecalcitrant or ganic pollutants. A large number of 
advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been succe ssfully applied to degrade 
pollutants present in waters. These methods are bas ed on the generation of a very 
powerful oxidizing agent such as hydroxyl radical (•OH) in solution, able to destroy 
organics up to their mineralization. In recent year s new AOPs based on the 
electrochemical technology are being developed. Ele ctrochemical advanced oxidation 
processes (EAOPs) are environmentally friendly emer ging methods for the 
decontamination of wastewaters contaminated with to xic and persistent herbicides, 
pesticides, chlorophenols, nitrophenols, polychlori nated biphenyls, pharmaceuticals, etc. 
This paper reports the fundamentals, main character istics and recent developments of 
EAOPs such as anodic oxidation and electro-Fenton a lone and coupled with other 
physicochemical processes. These techniques utilize  electrolytic systems such as three-
electrode divided and two-electrode undivided cells  with different cathodes as working 
electrodes (carbon-felt or O 2-diffusion cathode) and auxiliary electrodes (Pt, P bO 2, 
boron-doped diamond (BDD) or iron anode). The effec t of several experimental 
parameters that largely influence the degradation r ate of organic pollutants is discussed. 
Chromatographic analyses and total organic carbon ( TOC) and chemical oxygen 
demand (COD) measurements show a quick disappearanc e of initial pollutants and their 
aromatic and aliphatic reaction products in all cas es. The great capacity of oxidation 
and/or mineralization of all these EAOPs to deconta minate acidic aqueous solutions of 
common herbicides and pesticides is described.

Introduction 
Conventional processes for water treatment are inef ficient to destroy toxic and 
biorecalcitrant organic micropollutants. Among such  persistent organic pollutants 
(POPs), herbicides and pesticides are compounds of great interest since they are 
found at relatively high contents in the aquatic en vironment. In the last 30 years a 
large variety of chemical [1-4], photochemical [5-9 ] and electrochemical [10-14] 
methods have been developed to successfully solve t his problem. These 
procedures called advanced oxidation processes (AOP s) are based on the use of a 
very strong oxidizing agent such as hydroxyl radica l ( •OH) with E° ( •OH/H 2O) = 
2.8 V/NHE, which is generated in situ in the reactio n medium. They are applied 
when conventional oxidation techniques become insuf ficient by kinetic reasons 
or because pollutants are refractory to chemical ox idation in aqueous medium or 
are partially oxidized yielding reaction products e ven with greater toxicity than 
that of starting pollutants. In contrast, hydroxyl radicals generated in AOPs are 
able to non-selectively destroy most organic and or ganometallic contaminants 
until their complete mineralization, that is, their  conversion into CO 2, water and 
inorganic ions. These radicals react rapidly with o rganics mainly either by 
abstraction of a hydrogen atom (dehydrogenation) or  by addition to a non-
saturated bond (hydroxylation). For example, second -order rate constants as high 
as 10 9-10 10  M -1 s -1 have been determined for the hydroxylation reactio ns of 
aromatic compounds [15]. 
Electrochemical methods are clean and effective tec hniques for the direct 
production (anodic oxidation) or indirect generatio n via Fenton’s reagent 
(electro-Fenton) of hydroxyl radicals. In anodic ox idation these radicals are 
formed from water oxidation (reaction (1)) on a hig h O 2-overvoltage anode such 
as a Pt, PbO 2 and boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrode [16-19]. T he electro-
Fenton method corresponds to a coupling between the  Fenton’s reagent and 
electrochemistry [10,11,20-22] in which H 2O2 electrogenerated at the cathode 
reacts with Fe 2+  present in the medium leading to the formation of hydroxyl 
radicals from Fenton’s reaction (2). The effectiven ess of this treatment can be 
enhanced if anodic oxidation with BDD is coupled to  classical electro-Fenton 
with a carbon-felt or O 2-diffusion cathode [23,24].

In our laboratories we have previously studied the electro-Fenton degradation of 
some aromatic compounds, mainly herbicides such as chlorophenoxy acids 
[11,23,25-29] and organophosphorus [30], pesticides  [22], dyes [31,32], 
industrial pollutants [29,31,33,34] and pharmaceuti cals as emerging pollutants 
[24,35,36] using different electrolytic cells. The outstanding oxidizing power of 
electro-Fenton processes is explained by the fast r eaction of organics with •OH 
formed in the medium from reaction (2) and in some cases, at the anode from 
reaction (1), being the former reaction enhanced by  the additional regeneration of M.A. Oturan and E. Brillas / Portugaliae Electrochi mica Acta 25 (2007) 1-18  
 
 3 Fe 2+  from cathodic reduction of Fe 3+ . The mineralization rate of electrolyzed 
solutions were determined from the measurement of t heir chemical oxygen 
demand (COD) and/or total organic carbon (TOC). To know the evolution of the 
chemical composition of treated solutions, the deca y kinetics of starting 
pollutants were followed by high-performance liquid  chromatography (HPLC) 
and reaction intermediates were identified by gas c hromatography-mass 
spectrometry (GC-MS) and followed by different HPLC  techniques. 
In this paper the fundamentals, main characteristic s and recent developments of 
anodic oxidation and electro-Fenton alone and coupl ed with other 
physicochemical processes leading to the photoelect ro-Fenton [25,37], peroxi-
coagulation [38,39] and sonoelectro-Fenton methods are revised, taking into 
account mainly the work made by the present authors . We will describe the great 
capacity of oxidation and/or mineralization of all these EAOPs to decontaminate 
common herbicides and pesticides in acidic aqueous medium. 
 
 
Experimental 
Chemicals 
All organic pollutants, background electrolytes, ac ids, catalysts, organic solvents 
and other chemicals employed were analytical, HPLC or reagent grade from 
different companies and were used in the electroche mical experiments without 
further purification. Solutions were prepared with ultra-pure water obtained from 
a Millipore Milli-Q system with resistivity > 18 M Ω cm at room temperature. 
 
Instruments and analytical procedures 
Electrolyses were performed with different potentio stat/galvanostat systems or 
DC power supplies using three-electrode divided and  two-electrode undivided 
glass cells under controlled-potential and controll ed-current electrolysis 
conditions, respectively. These cells contained Pt or Fe grid or sheet electrodes or 
a BDD thin-film electrode from CSEM as the anode an d an O 2-diffusion 
electrode from E-TEK or a carbon-felt electrode or a graphite bar, both from 
Carbone Lorraine, as the cathode. The geometric are a of all electrodes varied 
from 3 cm 2 to 10 cm 2, except for the carbon-felt cathode that a greater  geometric 
area up to 70 cm 2 was employed. The photoelectro-Fenton became opera tive by 
illuminating the solution with a Philips 6 W fluore scent black light blue tube 
placed at the top of the open cell, at 7 cm above t he solution. This tube emitted 
UVA light in the wavelength region between 300 and 420 nm, with λmax  = 360 
nm, supplying a photoionization energy input to the  solution of 140 µW cm -2, as 
detected with a NRC 820 laser power meter working at  514 nm. 
The mineralization rate of treated solutions (100-1 50 ml) was monitored by the 
abatement of their total organic carbon (TOC) using  a Shimadzu VCSN TOC 
analyzer or by the fall of their chemical oxygen de mand (COD) using a French 
AFNOR NFT-90-101 norm. 
Aromatic reaction intermediates were identified by GC-MS technique using a 
Hewlett-Packard system composed of a HP 5890 Series  II gas chromatograph 
fitted with a HP-5 0.25 µm or a HP-Innowax 0.25 µm,  both of 30 m x 0.25 mm, 
column and coupled with a HP 5989A mass spectromete r operating in EI mode at M.A. Oturan and E. Brillas / Portugaliae Electrochi mica Acta 25 (2007) 1-18  
 
 4 70 eV. The kinetic decay of initial pollutants and the evolution of their aromatic 
reaction products were followed by reversed-phase H PLC chromatography using 
a Waters 600 or a Merck Lachrom HPLC chromatograph fitted with a Spherisorb 
ODS2 5 µm, 15 cm x 4.6 mm, or a Purospher RP-18 5 µ m, 25 cm x 4.6 mm, 
column, respectively, and coupled to the correspond ing Waters 996 or L-7455 
photodiode array detector selected at the wavelengt h of their maximum UV-Vis 
absorption peaks. Generated carboxylic acids were i dentified and quantified by 
ion-exclusion HPLC chromatography with the above ch romatographic systems 
fitted with a Biorad Aminex HPX 87H, 30 cm x 7.8 mm , column at 35 ºC or a 
Supelco Supelcogel H 9 µm, 25 cm x 4.6 mm, column a t 40 ºC, selecting the 
photodiode detector at λ = 210 nm. H 2O2 concentration in electrolyzed solutions 
was determined from the light absorption of the tit anic-hydrogen peroxide 
colored complex at λ = 408 nm using a Unicam UV4 Prisma double-beam 
spectrometer thermostated at 25.0 ºC. 
 
 
Results and discussion 
Anodic oxidation 
Classical anodic oxidation is the most common elect rochemical method for the 
treatment of organic pollutants. This technique uti lizes a high O 2-overvoltage 
anode such as Pt, PbO 2 and BDD to favor the generation of •OH adsorbed at its 
surface from water oxidation by reaction (1) [18,19 ]. Hydroxyl radical is a very 
powerful, non-selective, oxidizing agent that react s rapidly with organic 
compounds via hydroxylation with addition of a hydr oxyl group to a non-
saturated bond or dehydrogenation with the loss of a hydrogen atom, following a 
radical mechanism until their overall mineralizatio n, i.e., the transformation of 
initial pollutants into carbon dioxide, water and i norganic ions. 
In the comparative examples presented below, anodic  oxidation is utilized alone 
and associated with the electro-Fenton process, whe re it constitutes the anodic 
contribution of the electrolytic cell. We will see that the additional production of 
•OH from classical electro-Fenton using the hydrogen  peroxide produced at the 
cathode enhances significantly the mineralization r ate of treated solutions. 
 
Electro-Fenton process 
The electro-Fenton method is an indirect electrooxi dation technique with higher 
oxidation power than anodic oxidation for water rem ediation. It is an 
electrochemical advanced oxidation process based on  the continuous supply to 
an acidic contaminated aqueous solution of hydrogen  peroxide formed from the 
two-electron reduction of oxygen gas (reaction (3))  at mercury [21,40], carbon-
felt [11,26,41,42] and O 2-diffusion [20,23-25,32,35,36,43] cathodes: 
 
O2(g)   +  2 H + +  2 e −  →  H 2O2 (3)  
 
A small quantity of Fe 2+  or Fe 3+  ions is then added to the solution to strongly 
increase the oxidation power of electrogenerated H 2O2. An advantage of the M.A. Oturan and E. Brillas / Portugaliae Electrochi mica Acta 25 (2007) 1-18  
 
 5 electro-Fenton process is the catalytic behavior of  the Fe 3+ /Fe 2+  system: Fe 2+  is 
oxidized by H 2O2 from Fenton’s reaction (2) giving rise to hydroxyl  radical and 
Fe 3+ , whereas Fe 3+  thus obtained or initially added to the solution i s continuously 
reduced to Fe 2+  from reaction (4) (electrochemical catalysis): 
 
Fe 3+   + e −  →  Fe 2+  (4)  
 
Electrochemical reactions (3) and (4) can take plac e using a three-electrode 
divided cell or a two-electrode undivided cell. In the first case, the aqueous 
solution is maintained under oxygen saturation by b ubbling compressed air and 
the main reactions involved in the production of •OH are depicted in Fig. 1 
[21,26,42]. In the second case, the generation rate  of H 2O2 is controlled by means 
of a carbon polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) O 2-diffusion cathode [10,23,36,43] 
or a carbon-felt cathode [11,22,41]. Organic pollut ants are then oxidized by the 
combined action of •OH produced at the anode from reaction (1) and in t he 
homogeneous medium from Fenton’s reaction (2). Some  examples considering 
the alternative use of Pt and BDD anodes under thes e conditions will be 
discussed below. 
A variant of the electro-Fenton process is the so-c alled photoelectro-Fenton 
method, where the treated solution is irradiated wi th UVA light of λmax  = 360 nm 
that causes the photo-Fenton reaction of Fe(OH) 2+ , the predominant species of 
Fe 3+  in acid medium [5,44]: 
 
Fe(OH) 2+   +  hν  →  Fe 2+   +  •OH  (5)  
 
Hydroxyl radicals can thus be produced at higher ra te by the simultaneous 
reactions (2) and (5). In addition, complexes of Fe3+  with carboxylic acids 
generated from the initial pollutants, as oxalic ac id, can be quickly 
photodecomposed into CO 2 [44]. 
Another related electrochemical technique is the so -called peroxi-coagulation 
method that utilizes a sacrificial iron anode to co ntinuously inject Fe 2+  to the 
solution as follows: 
 
Fe  →  Fe 2+   +  2 e − (6)  
 
A part of Fe 3+  ions produced from Fenton’s reaction (2) between e lectrogenerated 
Fe 2+  and H 2O2 then precipitates in the form of Fe(OH) 3. In these scenarios 
organic pollutants can be removed by the direct oxi dizing action of •OH, as well 
as by their coagulation with the Fe(OH) 3 precipitate.

Degradation of organic pollutants using an undivided cell

made in most cases with a stirred solution containi ng 0.05 M Na 2SO 4 as

 7 electrolysis (galvanostatic conditions). Fig. 2 ill ustrates the evolution of 
hydrogen peroxide concentration in solution when a Pt anode and an O 2-diffusion 
cathode are used [43]. The concentration of this el ectrogenerated species 
increases with time up to attain a quasi-steady val ue after 2 h of electrolysis, just 
when its generation rate at the O 2-diffusion cathode from reaction (3) and its 
decomposition rate at the Pt anode become equal. Th e plateau corresponding to 
the steady-state concentration (curve a) decreases slightly in the presence of Fe 2+  
(curve b), since H 2O2 is consumed by Fenton’s reaction (2), and varies 
proportionally to the applied current. Comparison o f curves c and d of Fig. 2 
allows concluding that the presence of 100 mg l -1 aniline in solution causes a 
slight drop of the plateau due to the acceleration of Fenton’s reaction (2) by the 
consumption of •OH to degrade aniline and its oxidation products.

1 mM Fe 2+  in a Pt/O 2 diffusion cell, ( d) photoelectro-Fenton with 1 mM Fe 2+  and UVA 
light in a Pt/O 2 diffusion cell [20]. 
 
The above Pt/O 2 diffusion cell was utilized to determine the degra dation rate of 
several herbicides in aqueous medium from the abate ment of their TOC. As an 
example, Fig. 3 shows the comparative TOC removal f ound for an aqueous 
solution of 194 mg L -1 4-CPA (4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid) of pH 3.0 treat ed at 
constant current of 100 mA by anodic oxidation, ele ctro-Fenton and 
photoelectro-Fenton [20]. The photoelectro-Fenton m ethod (curve d) yields a 
much higher mineralization rate than the electro-Fe nton one (curve c), whereas 
anodic oxidation in the absence (curve a) and presence (curve b) of 
electrogenerated H 2O2 gives a similar and quite poor mineralization. The se 
results demonstrate that greater amount of reactive  •OH is produced in the M.A. Oturan and E. Brillas / Portugaliae Electrochi mica Acta 25 (2007) 1-18  
 
 8 medium from Fenton’s reaction (2) than at the Pt su rface from reaction (1), thus 
accounting for by the higher oxidant power of elect ro-Fenton than anodic 
oxidation. The positive action of photoelectro-Fent on is due to the 
photodegradation of complexes of Fe 3+  with final carboxylic acids by UVA light. 
The optimum mineralization rate is found at pH 3.0.  This behavior is general for 
most aromatic pollutants, which are efficiently deg raded at pH 3-4 by electro-
Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton. In contrast, the ch ange in solution pH does not 
affect significantly the degradation rate in anodic  oxidation.

Reversed-phase and ion-exclusion HPLC chromatograph ic analyses of the above

Aromatic reaction products were also identified by GC-MS. The proposed 
reaction sequence given in Fig. 4 for the degradati on of 4-CPA under the oxidant 
action of •OH [20] is initiated by the breaking of its C(1)-O bond to give 4-
chlorophenol and glycolic acid. 4-chlorophenol is s ubsequently transformed into 
4-chloro-1,2-dihydroxybenzene, hydroquinone and p-benzoquinone. These 
products are then oxidized to a mixture of malic, m aleic and fumaric acids, which 
are further converted into oxalic acid. The latter acid is also formed from the

Formic acid is directly oxidized to CO 2 by •OH. In contrast, oxalic acid is very

with Fe 3+  in electro-Fenton. These Fe 3+ -oxalato complexes are rapidly 
photodecarboxylated, with loss of Fe 2+  [44], under UVA irradiation in 
photoelectro-Fenton.

Electro-Fenton process with a BDD anode 
The use of a BDD anode instead of a Pt one increase s strongly the efficiency of the 
electro-Fenton process. In this case, very reactive  hydroxyl radicals are formed in the 
medium from Fenton’s reaction (2), as well as at th e BDD anode surface from reaction 
(1) due to its higher O 2-overvoltage, causing a large acceleration of the o xidation rate of 
organic pollutants. However, the reactivity of thes e two kinds of radicals depends on the 
nature of organics. This can be deduced from Fig. 5 , where the comparative decay of 
two herbicides belonging to the family of chlorophe noxyalcanoic acids, 4-chloro-2-
methylphenoxyacetic acid (MCPA) and 2,4-dichlorophe noxyacetic acid (2,4-D), at pH 
3.0 treated by electro-Fenton using a BDD/O 2 diffusion cell and anodic oxidation using 
a BDD/graphite cell at 100 mA is presented [23]. As  can be seen, both herbicides are 
rapidly destroyed in 12-30 min by the electro-Fento n method, whereas they need a 
much longer time (from 360 to 540 min) to be remove d by anodic oxidation. The very 
fast drop of MCPA and 2,4-D concentrations in elect ro-Fenton confirms their quick 
reaction with •OH in the medium. In contrast, the reaction of both  aromatics with •OH 
adsorbed at the BDD surface taking place in anodic oxidation is much slower. The inset 
panel of Fig. 5 shows that the decay of both herbic ides always follows a pseudo-first-
order kinetics. The TOC vs. consumed specific charg e ( Q, in A h l -1) plots for the above M.A. Oturan and E. Brillas / Portugaliae Electrochi mica Acta 25 (2007) 1-18

attained in all cases because •OH adsorbed on BDD destroys efficiently all final 
carboxylic acids, although a higher mineralization rate is found for the electro-Fenton 
method due to the faster reaction of aromatic pollu tants with •OH in the medium.

Electro-Fenton process with an iron anode (peroxi-c oagulation method) 
The peroxi-coagulation method utilizes a cell conta ining a sacrificial iron anode 
and an O 2-diffusion cathode. As can be seen in Fig. 7, this technique is largely 
effective to decontaminate concentrated solutions o f chlorophenoxyalcanoic 
herbicides such as 4-CPA, MCPA, 2,4-D, dicamba (3,6 -dichloro-2-
methoxybenzoic acid) and 2,4,5-T (2,4,5-trichloroph enoxyacetic acid) [39]. The 
organic matter is simultaneously removed by its min eralization with •OH 
produced from Fenton’s reaction (2) between H 2O2 and Fe 2+  electrogenerated at 
the cathode (reaction (3)) and anode (reaction (6)) , respectively, and by its 
coagulation with the precipitate of Fe(OH) 3 formed from the excess of Fe 3+  
obtained from Fenton’s reaction.

Electro-Fenton process with a Pt/carbon felt cell 
The carbon-felt electrode has a high specific surfa ce. An interesting characteristic 
of this cathode is that it can generate both compon ents of the Fenton’s reagent 
(H 2O2 and Fe 2+ ), but hydroxyl radicals are produced from Fenton’s  reaction (2) in 
the bulk solution. This allows keeping an efficient  concentration of Fe 2+  in 
solution from reaction (4), giving rise to a rapid destruction of organic 
compounds, as exemplified in Fig. 8 for the herbici de diuron. Fig. 8 also shows 
the significant role that plays the applied current  on the degradation rate of 
organic pollutants. A faster decay kinetics for diu ron with increasing current can 
be observed [46]. At the highest current of 300 mA,  the complete degradation of 
0.17 mM diuron is attained in only 6 min, but this time becomes gradually longer 
when applied current decreases. 
At present it is well-known that the solution pH is  an important control parameter 
of the effectiveness of the electro-Fenton process.  Several authors have reported 
that a pH value close to 3 yields the maximum effic iency for Fenton’s reagent 
and consequently, for the electro-Fenton process. T he nature of the inorganic 
acid used to adjust the solution pH can also play a  significant role on the 
oxidation power of this technique. Fig. 9 illustrat es the effect of pH and the 
nature of the medium on the mineralization rate of 0.2 mM methyl parathion (an 
organophosphorus herbicide) [47]. A faster TOC abat ement can be observed at 
pH 3.0 in comparison to pH 4.0 and 1.0 in both sulp hate and perchlorate media. 
In all pH values the perchlorate solutions are more  rapidly decontaminated. After 
9 h of electrolysis, the solution TOC is reduced by  approximately 100% at pH 
3.0 in perchlorate medium. The mineralization rate is slightly slower at pH 4.0, 
where the precipitation of Fe 3+  in the form of Fe(OH) 3 is initiated, but it becomes M.A. Oturan and E. Brillas / Portugaliae Electrochi mica Acta 25 (2007) 1-18  
 
 12 insignificant at pH 1.0 when Fe 2+  ions form complexes with H 2O2 and SO 42− 
ions. A similar behavior is found for media contain ing HCl.

Degradation of organic pollutants using a divided cel l 
These experiments were carried out with a three-ele ctrode cell containing 125 
mL of a solution acidified with H 2SO 4, a carbon felt as working electrode 
(cathode), a Pt sheet as auxiliary electrode (anode ) and a saturated calomel 
electrode (SCE) as reference electrode. Electrolyse s were performed by 
controlling the cathodic potential ( Eapp  = -0.5 V/SCE) or by applying a controlled 
variable current. 
The mineralization kinetics of an aqueous solution with 1 mM 2,4-D treated by 
electro-Fenton with a carbon-felt cathode is presen ted in Fig. 10. An almost total 
mineralization (> 95% TOC removal) can be observed after the consumption of 
2000 C [11]. Reversed-phase HPLC analysis of treate d solutions allowed the 
detection of some primary hydroxylated derivatives formed at the early stages of 
the treatment such as 2,4-dichlorophenol, 2,4-dichl ororesorcinol, 4,6-
dichlororesorcinol, 2-chlorohydroquinone and 1,2,4- trihydroxybenzene. The 
presence of these derivatives in the reaction mediu m confirms the attack of 
hydroxyl radical on the aromatic ring of 2,4-D lead ing to the formation of its 
hydroxylated derivatives and other processes, as de chlorination and 
dehydrogenation. The primary derivatives can also r eact with •OH, similarly to 
2,4-D, to give polyhydroxylated compounds and quino nes before undergoing the 
attack of the oxidant to open the benzene moiety pr oducing short-chain 
carboxylic acids.

Treatment of pesticides commercial formulations 
The electro-Fenton method has also shown an excelle nt ability to decompose 
aqueous solutions of commercial formulations of pes ticides such as Mistel GD 
(fungicide of Novartis Agro) and Cuprofix (fungicide  of ELF Atochem Agri) 
[22]. Mistel GD is a mixture of the active principl es cymoxanil and mancozebe M.A. Oturan and E. Brillas / Portugaliae Electrochi mica Acta 25 (2007) 1-18  
 
 14 along with additives, whereas Cuprofix contains cym oxanil, zinebe, CuSO 4 and 
surfactants as additives. Reversed-phase HPLC chrom atographic analysis of a 
Mistel GD solution treated in a Pt/carbon felt cell  by electro-Fenton at 100 mA 
reveals that cymoxanil and mancozebe are rapidly re moved after electrolysis 
times of 90 and 140 min, respectively (see Fig. 11) . Taking into account the 
complex consumption of hydroxyl radicals by the add itives, these removal times 
seem reasonable. Fig. 11 also shows that the use of  either Fe 3+  or Cu 2+  as catalyst 
leads to practically the same decay rate, although it is slightly higher for Cu 2+ . In 
contrast, the catalytic action of Fe 2+  on H 2O2 is more effective than Cu + for COD 
reduction, since 92% and 80% of mineralization is a ttained for the same Mistel 
GD solution with Fe 3+  and Cu 2+ , respectively, after the consumption of 6000 C at 
300 mA. The positive catalytic action of Cu 2+  in the electro-Fenton method has 
also been corroborated in the treatment of a Cuprof ix solution without addition of 
Fe 3+ . Under these conditions, zinebe and cymoxanil, the  active principles of 
Cuprofix, are completely removed from the medium in  70 and 150 min, 
respectively, by applying a constant current of 100  mA [22]. As can be seen in 
Fig. 12, Cuprofix can be completely mineralized whe n electrolysis is prolonged 
up to the consumption of a charge of 10000 C, that is, after 8 h of treatment at 
350 mA. The mineralization rate is slightly higher when Fe 3+  is added as catalyst.

Electro-Fenton coupled to sonolysis (sonoelectro-Fe nton) 
This new method corresponds to the coupling of elec tro-Fenton with the 
simultaneous irradiation of ultrasounds. Organic po llutants can then be destroyed 
by the combined action of •OH generated by Fenton’s reaction (2) and different  
processes caused by the ultrasounds such as pyrolys is in cavitation bubbles and 
oxidation by •OH formed from water sonolysis: 
 
H2O ultrasounds  →  H•  +  •OH  (7)  
 
The cell employed in sonoelectro-Fenton is a three- electrode divided cell, 
identical to that described above for classical ele ctro-Fenton. The ceramic 
producing the ultrasounds is placed below the base of the electrochemical cell 
and such irradiation is transmitted to the solution  treated by electro-Fenton 
through a transductor. In this way solutions are su bmitted to ultrasonic 
irradiations of high frequency (460 and 465 kHz) an d low frequency ( ≈28 kHz), 
with powers of 20, 60 and 80 W. 
Fig. 13 presents the evolution of 2,4-D concentrati on during comparative electro-
Fenton and sonoelectro-Fenton treatments. A clear i ncrease in degradation rate 
for high and low frequencies in comparison to the e lectrolysis alone can be 
observed. Since the application of sonolysis alone does not yield a signification 
degradation of 2,4-D, one can infer that the faster  degradation found using 
sonoelectro-Fenton is rather due to the mechanical effects of ultrasounds 
(increase in the transport rate of electroactive sp ecies towards the working 
electrode), instead of chemical effects (e.g., prod uction of •OH by sonolysis from 
reaction (7)). Fig. 13 also shows that the degradat ion rate using ultrasounds of 80 M.A. Oturan and E. Brillas / Portugaliae Electrochi mica Acta 25 (2007) 1-18  
 
 16 W becomes lower than that of electro-Fenton. This l oss in mineralization ability 
of the sonoelectro-Fenton system could be related t o a degasification effect of the 
solution that causes a significant decay in O 2 concentration near the cathode, thus 
decreasing the electrogeneration of H 2O2 from reaction (3) and the formation of 
oxidant •OH from Fenton’s reaction (2).

Conclusions 
The electro-Fenton method seems very attractive by its ability to efficiently 
destroy organic micropollutants of waters contamina ted with persistent organic 
pollutants (POPs), particularly herbicides and pest icides. It is usually applied 
with a Pt anode, but other anodic materials such as  PbO 2, BDD (with much 
higher O 2-overvoltage) or even iron (sacrificial anode) can also be utilized in 
divided or undivided cells. Different catalysts inc luding salts of Fe 2+ , Fe 3+  and 
Cu 2+  alones or combined can be used to produce hydroxyl  radical by reaction 
with hydrogen peroxide electrogenerated at a carbon -felt or O 2-diffusion cathode. 
The degradation and mineralization reactions of her bicides and pesticides with 
this radical shown in this paper always obey a pseu do-first-order kinetics. 
Intermediate reaction products formed during all tr eatments are also mineralized. 
The final electrolyzed solutions contain only inorg anic ions, along with short-
chain carboxylic acids when overall mineralization is not attained. 
In this paper we show that the electro-Fenton metho d can be easily coupled to 
other degradation techniques involving photochemist ry (photoelectro-Fenton), M.A. Oturan and E. Brillas / Portugaliae Electrochi mica Acta 25 (2007) 1-18  
 
 17 sonochemistry (sonoelectro-Fenton) or electrocoagul ation (peroxi-coagulation) to 
enhance the mineralization ability of treated solut ions. Thus, the alternative use 
of photoelectro-Fenton or sonoelectro-Fenton leads to a positive synergic effect 
on the degradation rate of herbicides. 
Finally, we can remark that the electro-Fenton meth od is an ecological technique 
because it can yield the total mineralization of PO Ps without addition of toxic 
chemical reagents and without production of dangero us wastes. The application 
of this procedure is inexpensive due to its low ope rational energy cost.
