Abstract  
              Toxic substances  removal is necessary to achieve sustainability in wastewater treatment. It can be 
quite difficult to provide effective care at an affordable price. Adsorption techniques have successfully been  
shown to be capable of achieving the desired sustainable wastewater treatment. This review shows how several 
biosorpt ion agents can remove harmful substances  from wastewater.

Introduction - 
Water is the most valuable natural resource in the world and is necessary for all living things to survive. 
Nearly 71% of the earth's surface is covered in water, mostly in the form of oceans and other large reservoirs. 
Because physical processes including precipitation, evaporation, surface runoff, and infiltration frequently 
result in water entering the ocean. 0.001% of the water in the atmospher e is present as precipitation, clouds, 
and vapour, and 1.6% of the water is present on the ground. Humanity and other living things both need access 
to clean, fresh water to survive. However, the freshwater portion of the earth's ecosystem makes up only 
around 0.5% of the total, with river stations only up 0.01% of the total area.  Due to its minimal quantities, this 
stream of water is therefore of tremendous significance (Khatri & Tyagi 2015). Recent years have seen a sharp 
increase in the need for clean wa ter due to the rapid growth of businesses and population. According to the 
most recent report (Mckinsey 2009), several emerging countries will require more water than 50% of the time 
by the year 2030.  
In recent years, due to the presence of untreated waste waters, pesticides, and chemicals in the 
environment, water pollution has become the one global problem. Heavy metals and dyes are harmful 
contaminants that are released into water bodies directly or indirectly as a result of human, agricultural, and 
indus trial activities.  Human consumption of these waters spreads dangerous disorder. Typhoid, cholera, 
diarrhoea, and dysentery are only a few of the water -borne diseases caused by the deadly bacteria and viruses 
in this contaminated water (Ali 2014; Wang & Yan g 2016).

 c673  Toxic  Nature  of Pollutants  
 
Due to water pollution, it is dangerous to have untreated drinking water today. The change in 
water's physical, chemical, and biological properties is the main source of pollution. Heavy metals and dyes 
are two examples of both organic and inorganic contaminants that are major contributors to wastewater that 
pollutes the aquatic environment. Hazardous health difficulties for humans and other living species are caused 
by toxic heavy metals like copper (Cu), chromi um (Cr), lead (Pb), nickel (Ni), mercury (Hg), cobalt and 
cadmium (Cd), as well as dyes in wastewater (Basaran et al. 2016; Hamidian et al. 2019; Vesali -Naseh et al. 
2019; Sahoo et al. 2018).  The vast majority of industrial applications consume more synthe tic dyes than 
natural dyes, mostly due to their brilliant colours, ease of application, lower cost of production, and greater 
resistance to environmental factors. However, these colours are currently becoming more toxic, mutagenic, 
and carcinogenic (Ngah e t al. 2011; Sinha et al. 2018). These heavy metals and dye -containing effluents enter 
water bodies as runoff from a variety of companies, including those that manufacture paint, smelt metal, mine 
for ore, process metal, process ore, manufacture batteries, and polish metal. Even if heavy metals have been 
used as fertilisers for growing vegetation at the microscopic level, high amounts can still have a variety of 
toxic effects.  
 
 Requisite  Of Toxic  Pollutants  Removal - 
 
                       The most common an d dangerous pollutants are heavy metals, dyes, and pigments. They are 
produced by a range of companies, including those that make batteries, paper and pulp, leather tanning, 
textiles, and other goods, as well as residential, agricultural, and industrial pr ocesses. The accumulation of 
these hazardous contaminants in various internal organs of the human body causes major health problems for 
the human race. In order to safeguard the ecosystem and to prevent pollutants from entering food systems, 
efficient wast e disposal is necessary (Kumar et al. 2014).  
 
 
 BIOSORPTION  
 
One of the best methods for excluding contaminants from wastewater has shown to be adsorption. 
Adsorption is a process that occurs when a liquid or gas solute builds up on a liquid or solid surface, forming 
an atomic or molecular film. The chemical, physic al, and biological systems are examples of the three main 
systems where this approach is effective. The term "adsorbent" refers to the surface of the solid on which 
adsorption is taking place, while "adsorbate" refers to the solute that engaged in the adso rption process. 
Physical adsorption and chemisorption are two different categories for the adsorption process. The weak Van 
der Waals forces cause the physical adsorption to occur. This type of adsorption has lower enthalpy values and 
is reversible. The ch emisorption process, on the other hand, results from the chemical attraction between the 
adsorbent and adsorbate. It is irreversible and has a high enthalpy (Hernandez -Eudave et al. 2016). Adsorption 
is typically thought of as a surface phenomena, although  the entire process actually takes place within the 
adsorbent's pores as well as on its surface. Four processes are included in the adsorption mechanism onto the    © 2023 IJNRD | Volume 8, Issue 7 July 2023 | ISSN: 2456 -4184 | IJNRD.ORG

 c674 adsorbent during the removal of the pollutant: advective transport, film transfer, mass transf er, and 
intraparticle diffusion. In the first step, solute particles are moved from bulk solution on the immovable  film 
layer through axial dispersion or advective movement or diffusion which  is called  advective  transport.  In the 
second  step, the solute  particles  are penetrated and attached to the fixed water film layer, which is termed as 
film transfer. In the third step, the solute particles are attached to the adsorbent  surface  which  is called  the 
mass  transfer.  Then  the final step, the solute  particle s are moved into the pores present in the adsorbent 
surface. Unlike  other  common  technologies,  the adsorption  technique  has some  crucial  leads  (i) cool to 
handle (ii) the  adsorption  is reversible, adsorbent used  in this  process  may able to regenerate  and reuse  via 
desorption  process  (iii) inexpensive  (iv) choosy  adsorption  of metal  ions or dye molecules  (v) efficacious 
pollutants (metal/dye) ejection even at minimal concentration . 
 
Activated carbon (AC) is the most common sorbent used in wastewater treatment worldwide. Ancient Greeks, 
Egyptians, Romans, Sumerians, and Phoenicians used sorbents such as charcoal, sand, and clay to 
decontaminate and desalinate water. A new activated car bon precursor, charcoal, has been identified as a 
recognized prehistoric adsorbent material in wastewater treatment. Activated carbon is obtained through the 
process of dehydrating, activating, and carbonizing raw materials. The resulting yield has a huge surface area 
and a highly porous structure called activated carbon. This versatile sorbent has been used to remove many 
types of toxic contaminants, especially dyes and metals. Various types of activated carbon are available, 
including wood activated carbo n, hazelnut activated carbon, coconut shell activated carbon, sawdust activated 
carbon and pulverized carbon activated carbon, and are commercially viable for sorption of toxic pollutants 
(Anfar et al. 2019). Despite the finer use of activated carbon, inef ficiencies and excessive costs can limit its use. 
Therefore, recently researchers are looking for inexpensive sorbents that can be used to control water pollution. 
The holding cost aspect plays an important role here.   
  
Biosorption is a powerful technique  that uses dead, inert biomass to separate contaminants (heavy metals and 
dyes) from wastewater. This method is usually referred to as a physicochemical process and involves a number 
of metabolically independent processes that occur primarily in microbial cells and plant cell walls. 
Bioadsorption uses several natural substances as bioadsorbents, including physical and chemical adsorption, ion 
exchange, electrostatic interaction, chelation, complexation, reduction, and attachment of metal ions/dye 
molecules by precipitation. In general, this biosorption is a rapid and reversible process with several advantages. 
B. No increase in chemical oxygen demand (COD) of water, no need for additional nutrients, less sludge 
formation, high efficacy, minimal labor input, ease of use and biosorbent regeneration. The main task of the 
bioadsorption process is to find bioadsorption materials that can absorb metal ions/dye molecules with good 
attraction. Various types of biosorbents used to remove toxic contaminants include mic roorganisms (both living 
and dead), agricultural or industrial waste, plant material, etc. Fundamental functional groups present in 
biosorbents include amides, amines, thioethers, imidazoles, carbonyls, sulfonates, carboxyls, sulfhydryls, 
phenols, phosphod iesters, phosphates and imines, which can potentially bind and separate metal ions/dye 
molecules. Aqueous solutions (A k see 2005; Ahluwalia & Goyal 2007; Akar et al 2009).

 c675 DIFFERENT  TYPES OF  BIOSORBENTS  
Microorganisms  
 
Microorganisms spent as biosorbents for the separation of heavy  metals and dyes from waste 
effluents, which can able to tolerate undesirable  circumstances.  Different  kinds  of microbial  biosorbents  
(living  or dead)  including  algae,  bacteria,  fungi,  and yeast  present  in the environ ment.  Compare to living 
biomass, dead biomass has been widely used by various  researchers for the attaching of  metal ions/dye 
molecules as a result of no  need for nutrients and checking of COD and BOD in wastewaters. Thus, the  usage 
of dead microbial  bioma ss is cost-effective.  
 
Algae in waste water treatment - 
 
Algae is one of the eco -friendly and inexpensive biosorbent utilized  for the treatment  of effluent  and 
has established  attention  owing  to the excellent  adsorption  capacity,  limited  necessity  of nutrients,  abundantly  
obtainable, large extent cultivated across all over the world, the ability to  regenerate  and recover  heavy  metal  
or dye, a reduced  amount  of sludge  disposal and elevated surface  area to  volume ratio.  The major functional  
groups present in the algae are amino (NH 2-), carboxyl (COO-), hydroxyl  (OH-), and sulfate (SO 42-), which 
assist as an active site for the biosorption of  toxic  pollutants  (Wang  & Chen  2009).  Different  types  algae  have 
been employed  as biosorbent by several researchers for the toxic pollutants removal and are  involving blue -
green algae ( Synechocystis sp. (Öztürk et al. 2009) , Nostoc  muscorum  (Dixit  & Singh  2013)),  green  algae  
(e.g. Chlorella  vulgaris  
(Xie et al. 2014),  Scenedesmus  obliquus  (Abdel  Ghafar  et al. 2014) , Oedogonium  h. (Gupta  & Rastogi  2008),  
Scenedesmus  quadricauda  (Kızılkaya et al. 2012) , Cladophora glomerate (Lee & Chang 2011), Ulva  lactuca  
(El Sikaily  et al. 2006),  Chaetomorpha  linum  (Ajjabi  & Chouba  2009)  Caulerpa lentillifera (Pavasant et al. 
2006), Ulva onoi (Suzuki et al. 2005),  brown algae ( Sargassum sp. (Negm et al. 2018) , Ulva fasciata (Nessim 
et al.  2011),  Padina  sp (Khani  2013),  Fucus  vesiculosus  (Lebron  et al. 2019),  Cystroseria  baccata  (Herrero  et 
al. 2005),   and red algae  (Gelidium  sesquipedale                              Vilar  et al. 2006).    
 
Bacteria in waste water treatment - 
Bacterial biomass is participated in the biosorption as a biosorbent  due to its exceptional structure 
of the body and can be either particularly  grown  extensively  or generated  as a by-product  of industries.  The 
disadvantages  of using  this biomass  are the limited  choices  of various  constraints  including  temperature  and 
pH, and the intricate  biochemical  reactions. Because of their inadequate metal/dye uphold ability, bacteria are  
not effectively  treating  the toxic  pollutant  containing wastewater  in huge  amounts. Examples of bacteria are 
Bacillus sp. (Wierzba 2015) , Micrococcus  sp. (Bilal  et al.  2013),  and Pseudomonas  sp. (Garg  et al. 2012).  
 
Fungi in  waste  water treatment - 
 
Fungi generally have been propagated by utilizing low -cost culture  medium  and simple  
fermentation  technologies  or spent  carbohydrate  comprising  culture  medium.  These  fungal  biomasses  have  an    © 2023 IJNRD | Volume 8, Issue 7 July 2023 | ISSN: 2456 -4184 | IJNRD.ORG

 c676 ability  to eliminate  heavy  metals/dye  molecules  from  aqueous  solution  and are including Aspergillus niger ,  
White rot fungi  ,Tremella  fuciformis,   and   Auricularia   polytricha  . Same like fungi, yeasts are also cultured 
which are the  directly  obtainable  low-priced  resource.  Compare  to bacteria,  it is quite  bigger  in size. Since  the 
high rate of growth  and single -celled  nature,  these  yeast  biomasses  like Cunninghamella  elegans  (Ambrósio  
et al. 2012) , Candida  albicans  (Baysal  et al. 2008) , and Saccharomyces  cerevisiae  (Amirnia  et al.2015)  
are to be used as biosorbent  in wastewater  treatment.  
 
 Industrial  Wastes  and Byproducts - 
 
The different  industries,  mainly,  food manufacturing  industries,  generate huge capacities of wastes 
and byproducts. Cost relating to either the  treatment  of waste  or disposal  of these  wastes  is a serious  ecological  
challenge. Spending these cost -free industrial wastes an efficient biosorbent  for treating the wastewater  may 
provide a solution to the  dual problem with  an ecological  perspective.  Industrial  wastes released  from  
industries  are including tea industry waste from tea factory  (Sulyman  et al.  2017),  peach  and apricot  stones  
from juice  and jam industry  (Rashed  2006),  antibiotic  waste from antibiotic production complex (Yeddou -
Mezenner 2010), fly ash  from cement industry (Alinnor 2007), sludge from paper industry (Suryan &  
Ahluwalia 2012), red mud from aluminum industry (Ahmaruzzaman 2011) .  
 
 Agricultural  wastes  in waste water treatment - 
  
                 Agricultural  wastes,  mainly  comprising  cellulo se and lignin  indicate  the best metal  ions/dye  
molecules  binding  ability.  The essential  elements present in these wastes are starch,  water hydrocarbon,  a 
simple  sugar, protein, lignin, lipids, hemicellulose and extractives. These wastes are  cheap, easily available, 
effective, and renewable. Different agricultural wastes  like rice husk (Ye et al. 2010), wheat bran (Nouri & 
Hamdaoui 2007), black  gram husk (Saeed & Igbal 2003), sugarcane bagasse,  etc.,may be used as effectively in 
waste water treatment.  
    Conclusion - 
 One of the top goals for the current generation is the production of portable water from extremely polluted 
industrial wastewater. Application of the right adsorbents in wastewater treatment has proven to be very 
effective and cost -effective. An overview of adsorption procedures for pollutant removal was given in the 
current review. The current review has also offered a synopsis of the advancement of conventional and nano -
advanced adsorbents. Additionally, it produces almost no sludge and is wi dely available, regenerable, and 
accessible.  Therefore, the improvement of the wastewater treatment process employing sorption technology 
requires the deployment of biosorbents as green technology.On the basis of the references to various 
biosorbents that were utilised in this review study, we can draw the conclusion that various types of biosorbents 
may be used in the treatment of waste water.Algal biomass is the most effective and reasonable biosorbent 
material that can have the capacity to attract heavy metals and dyes from aqueous solutions when compared to 
all the other biosorbents.
