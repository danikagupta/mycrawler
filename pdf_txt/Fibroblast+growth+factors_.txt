The fate of iodinated basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 
after its binding to cultured astrocytes and hippocampal neu- 
rons was studied. Autoradiography after light and electron 
microscopy establishes that, if cells are returned to 37X, 
the 1251-basic FGF bound internalizes into vesicles in the 
cytoplasm, localizes to the perinuclear cytoplasm, and is 
translocated to chromatin structures of the nucleus. The ra- 
diolabeled protein is long-lived, a finding confirmed by bio- 
chemical analyses. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and 
autoradiography of both hippocampal neurons and astro- 
cyte extracts reveal that these cells internalize Y-basic 
FGF and then metabolize it to three major heparin-binding 
peptides with molecular weights of 15.5,9, and 4 kDa. These 
peptides are initially detected 16 hr after binding to neurons 
and 4 hr after binding to astrocytes but are still detectable 
46 and 16 hr, respectively, after initial binding (though pres- 
ent at lower levels). lmmunoprecipitation with sequence- 
specific antisera to basic FGF reveals that the 15.5kDa frag- 
ment is generated by cleavage at the carboxyl terminus, that 
the 9-kDa peptide contains the sequences between residues 
30 and 67, and the 4-kDa peptide is a C-terminus fragment 
containing the sequence of basic FGF( 106-l 20) but without 
basic FGF( 139-l 46) immunoreactivity. 
The internalization of basic FGF is required for this pro- 
cessing; the treatment of cells with trypsin and 2 M NaCl at 
different times after binding can only prevent the metabolism 
of basic FGF if it is performed immediately after binding. 
Similarly, WGA, which inhibits basic FGF binding to its high- 
affinity receptor, prevents the metabolism of basic FGF. The 
possible significance of a metabolic pathway that is re- 
sponsible for the processing of basic FGF after its internal- 
ization by cells in the CNS is discussed in light of its potential 
function as a neurotrophic factor.

Copyright 0 199 1 Society for Neuroscience 0270-6474/91/l 12249-10$03.00/O Peptide growth factors are internalized by cells after binding to 
their cell-surface receptors (Schwab, 1977; Heldin et al., 1982; 
Rosenfeld et al., 1984; Bergeron et al., 1985; Carpenter, 1987; 
Levi-Montalcini, 1987). In most cell types, the internalized pep- 
tide is shifted into lysosomes and degraded. In neurons, how- 
ever, internalization is often followed by retrograde or antero- 
grade axonal transport, an event that is implicated in the 
mechanism of action of neurotrophic factors (Thoenen and Ed- 
gar, 1985; Levi-Montalcini, 1987) like basic fibroblast growth 
factor (FGF). Basic FGF supports the survival and differenti- 
ation of neurons from many regions of the PNS and CNS in 
vitro(Morrison et al., 1986, 1988; Walicke et al., 1986; Unsicker 
et al., 1987; Hatten et al., 1988; Walicke, 1988) and can prevent 
neuronal death in viva (Anderson et al., 1988; Otto and Un- 
sicker, 1990). Although its mechanism of action is not known, 
specific binding sites for basic FGF have been characterized in 
cultures of fetal hippocampal neurons (Walicke et al., 1989). 
Extracellular glycosaminoglycans (GAGS), particularly heparan 
sulfate proteoglycans, account for 40-70% of total nonspecific 
binding, but there also exists a high-affinity glycoprotein recep- 
tor on the cell surface of neurons (Walicke et al., 1989). Thus, 
there most likely exist specific receptor-mediated intemaliza- 
tion, metabolism, and potentially transport of basic FGF by 
neurons. Indeed, the recent studies of Ferguson et al. (1990) 
established that basic FGF is transported anterogradely by ret- 
inal ganglion cells in viva 
Binding studies on mesenchymal cell types have suggested 
that the basic FGF receptor is down regulated (Neufeld and 
Gospodarowicz, 1985; Olwin and Hauschka, 1986; Moscatelli, 
1987). Unlike the case for epidermal growth factor (EGF), plate- 
let-derived growth factor (PDGF), and insulin (Heldin et al., 
1982; Mock and Niswender, 1983; Dunn and Hubbard, 1984; 
Bergeron et al., 1985; Carpenter, 1987) however, free lZSI-ty- 
rosine does not rapidly appear in the medium after binding lZ51- 
basic FGF. Instead, basic FGF appears to be degraded into a 
set of smaller peptides that remain associated with cells for 
several hours (Moenner et al., 1987, 1989; Moscatelli, 1988). 
In a recent series of studies, we have characterized the receptor 
for basic FGF on mesenchymal cells (Feige and Baird, 1988) 
and cells in the CNS (Walicke et al., 1989) and found that there 
were significant differences. In the studies reported here, we have 
extended these studies to compare the fate of basic FGF after 
its binding to neurons and astrocytes. In an effort to determine 
whether the metabolism of basic FGF might mediate its cellular 
(Magnaldo et al., 1986; Coughlin et al., 1988) and proposed 
nuclear (Baldin et al., 1990; Renko et al., 1990) effects, im- 
munoprecipitation studies were performed to identify the met- 
abolic fragments. 2250 Walicke and Baird - Metabolism of Basic FGF by Neurons and Astrocytes 
Materials and Methods 
Preparation of 12JZ-basic FGF. Recombinant human basic FGF (Barr 
et al., 1988) was iodinated by the lactoperoxidase method and purified 
by heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography as previously described 
(Baird et al., 1988). The specific activity averaged 105,000 cpm/ng. In 
all of the studies reported here, we have maintained the amino acid 
numbering system outlined by Esch et al. (1985) for the 146-amino 
acid protein. 
Tissue culture. Hippocampi were removed from 18-d fetal Sprague- 
Dawley rats, dissociated with 0.25% trypsin and trituration, and grown 
in serum-free medium as previously described (Walicke et al., 1986; 
Walicke, 1988) Astrocyte cultures were established from cerebral cortex 
of I-3-d-old rat pups as described (Walicke and Baird, 1988) and grown 
in 10% fetal calf serum in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM). 
Cells were grown at a density of lo6 cells/dish in 35mm tissue culture 
dishes coated with polyomithine and laminin. 
Radioreceptor assays. The medium used in the binding assays was 
identical to the respective serum-free formulations (Walicke, 1988) used 
to grow either neurons or astrocytes except for further addition of 20 
mM HEPES (pH, 7.4) and 0.2% gelatin. The binding assays were per- 
formed essentially as described by Moscatelli (1987) as modified for 
neurons (Walicke et al., 1989). ‘251-basic FGF (1 r&ml, 100,000 cpml 
ng) was added to the cells, and they were incubated for 3-4 hr at 4°C. 
The cells were then rinsed three times with 0.2% gelatin in DMEM 
containing 20 mM HEPES (pH, 7.4). At this point, some cells were 
processed immediately, while others received fresh growth medium and 
were returned to the 37°C incubator for the indicated times. 
Light microscopy and autoradiography. Cells for light microscopic 
autoradiography were grown on glass microscope slides at a density of 
3 x 104/cm2. The slides were coated with 0.5% gelatin, air dried, treated 
with 0.1 mg/ml polyomithine for 30 min, and then incubated overnight 
with 1 pdrnl laminin. For autoradiography, astrocytes were harvested 
with 0.25% trypsin, replated, and maintained for 2 d in serum-free 
medium. 
After rinsing, cells were fixed with 4% glutaraldehyde in phosphate- 
buffered saline for 15 min and rinsed three times with DMEM plus 
0.2% gelatin. They were then washed with water, dehydrated through 
a graded series of ethanol, defatted for 1 hr in 1: 1 chloroform/methanol, 
rehydrated, and allowed to dry overnight. The slides were dipped in a 
50% solution of Kodak NTB-2 emulsion, packaged with lead inserts 
between each sample, and exposed for 3-5 d at 4°C. The emulsion was 
developed with Kodak D 19 and fixed with Rapid Fix. After thorough 
rinsing, the cells were stained with a 15-min incubation in 1% cresyl 
violet. 
Electron microscopy and autoradiography. Cells were fixed by incu- 
bation with 2% glutaraldehyde in DMEM for 1 hr, rinsed three times 
with DMEM plus 0.2% gelatin and then with 0.125 M sodium phosphate, 
postfixed for 30 min in 1.3% osmium tetroxide, and dehydrated through 
a graded series of ethanol. The dish was filled with Polybed 8 12 (Polysci- 
ences), and the embedded neurons were peeled off the surface of the 
dish. The disks of Polybed were dipped in Kodak NTB-2 emulsion, 
exposed for 5 d at 4°C and developed for light microscopic autora- 
diography as above. Heavily labeled cells were marked with a stylus, 
and then the emulsion was washed from the disk with dilute NaOH. 
The blocks were trimmed down to the cells of interest, and lOO-nm 
sections were cut on a Reichardt OMU3 ultramicrotome and then 
mounted on Formvar-coated 300-mesh grids. 
The grids were mounted on glass coverslips with Scotch tape. Mono- 
layers of Ilford L-4 emulsion were formed with a nichrome-wire loop 
and applied to grids. The coverslips were packaged with lead inserts 
between samples and exposed for l-2 months at 4°C. They were de- 
veloped with Kodak D-19 (2 min, 18°C) followed by 1% acetic acid 
for 30 set and 30% sodium thiosulfate for 3 min. The samples were 
stained by a IO-min incubation with a saturated solution of uranyl 
acetate in 50% ethanol, followed by 0.4% lead citrate in 0.1 M NaOH 
for 5 min. After samples were rinsed with 0.02 M NaOH and water, 
they were dried. The samples were examined using a Zeiss 109 electron 
microscope. 
Metabolism of’25Z-basic FGF neurons andglia. At the indicated times, 
cells were washed with culture medium, scraped from the plates in 
solution A (0.15 M NaCl and 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, containing 5 mM 
EGTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.0 15 mg/ml pepstatin A, 
0.1 m&ml leupeptin, and 0.1 mg/ml aprotonin). The cells were collected 
by centrifugation for 10 min (14,000 x g, 4°C) and the pellet was 
solubilized in Laemmli’s (1970) sample buffer. Some experiments used heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography 
to concentrate Y-basic FGF and metabolites from cell extracts. In 
these instances, cells were collected and sonicated in solution A plus 
1.85 M NaCl. Unsolubilized debris was removed by centrifugation ( 14,000 
x g, 10 min, 4°C). The extract was diluted to 0.15 M NaCl and applied 
to a column of heparin-Sepharose (gel vol, 0.25-0.5 ml). The proteins 
were eluted with step gradients of NaCl at 0.15, 0.6, 1.0, and 2.0 M 
NaCl in 10 mM Tris buffer (pH, 7.4). The eluates were dialyzed overnight 
against distilled water in dialysis tubing with a 3-kDa molecular-weight 
cutoff (Spectra/Par), lyophilized, and resuspended in Laemmli’s sample 
buffer (Laemmli, 1970). Samples were chromatographed on 15% ac- 
rylamide gels prior to autoradiography. 
Zmmunoprecipitation. The antisera to basic FGF were prepared in 
rabbits by immunizing animals with the indicated synthetic peptides 
conjugated to bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, or keyhole limpet 
hemocyanin as previously described (Baird et al., 1985). The nentide 
sequences correspond to those of Esch et al. (1985) for’basic FGF[ l- 
1461, and antibodies were generated against basic FGF[ l-24]NH,, [TyrSo]- 
FGF[30-50]NH,, [Tyrg7]-FGF[69-87]NH2, FGF[106-120]NH,, and 
FGF[ 139-146]0H. After lyophilization, the proteins eluted from the 
heparin-Sepharose column were resuspended in 400 hl RIPA buffer 
consisting of 0.0 1 M sodium phosphate (pH, 7.2), 0.15 M NaCl, 0.0 1% 
aprotonin, 1% NP40, 1 .O% sodium deoxvcholate. 0.1% SDS. 2 mM 
EDTA, and 50 mM NaF. The mixture was incubated for 1 hr at &C with 
50 ~1 of protein A agarose. The agarose gel was removed by centrifu- 
gation, and 5 ~1 of antiserum was added to the supematants. After 
incubation for 1 hr at 4°C 50 ~1 of the protein A agarose was added, 
and the samples were incubated overnight at 4°C with agitation. The 
following day, the agarose beads were washed three times with RIPA 
buffer and once with 0.1% SDS in 10 mM Tris and 0.15 M NaCl. The 
samples were prepared for SDS-PAGE by boiling for 3 min in Laemmli’s 
sample buffer (Laemmli, 1970). 
Results Basic FGF binding to neurons and astrocytes. 
In all of the ex- 
periments described here, iZ51-basic FGF (1 @ml, - 100,000 
cpm/ng) was preincubated with hippocampal neurons or astro- 
cytes for 2-3 hr at 4°C in order for binding to reach a steady 
state (Walicke et al., 1989). The fate of basic FGF bound by 
either neurons or astrocytes was first investigated using light 
microscopic autoradiography. When cells were fixed immedi- 
ately after binding (Fig. lA,B), label was distributed rather dif- 
fusely around the margins of the cells. For the neurons (Fig. 
lA), grains could be seen outlining the soma and extending away 
from the cell in linear arrays (arrowheads). The cresyl violet 
counterstain reveals only nuclei and large proximal processes. 
The linear arrays show lZ51-basic FGF bound to finer neuritic 
processes, an interpretation supported by the observation of 
autoradiographic label associated with the fine processes de- 
tected by electron microscopic autoradiography (e.g., Fig. 
20). In the astrocyte cultures, label was distributed over the 
entire surface of the cells, but tended to be a bit denser along 
the cell margins at points of contact with the growth surface 
(Fig. 1B). Labeling with izsI-basic FGF was specific and could 
be blocked with excess cold basic FGF but not by insulin, EGF, 
NGF, or transferrin (data not shown). 
If cells are returned to 37°C for 16 hr after the binding assay, 
the distribution of label changes considerably. For neurons (Fig. 
lC), the label along the processes disappears. Instead, there is 
a dense accumulation of grains over the cell somata. Under 
higher magnification (Fig. lE), most of the label appears to lie 
over the perinuclear cytoplasm; however, a few grains appeared 
to be over the nucleus itself. A similar change is also seen for 
the astrocytes (Fig. lD,F); the label appears in the cytoplasm 
adjoining the nucleus. Although the pattern is similar, the rate 
of 1251-basic FGF redistribution observed by light microscopy 
is different between astrocytes and neurons. While neurons take The Journal of Neuroscience, July 1991, 7 I(7) 2251

campal neurons (A, C, and E) and astrocytes (B, D, and 8) was performed as described in the text. The cells were examined immediately after 
binding at 4°C (A, B) or after 16 hr at 37°C. Arrowheads in A show the linear array of label associated with neuronal processes. E and Fare higher-

16 hr at 37°C to show changes in distribution (see Fig. l), as- 
trocytes all show a much more rapid translocation often within 
0.5-l hr (not shown). 
The distribution of label observed under light microscopy 
suggests internalization of Y-basic FGF by cells. However, 
whole-cell preparations cannot provide unequivocal localiza- 
tion. For example, the binding sites for lZ51-basic FGF may 
remain membrane associated and concentrated by lateral dif- 
fusion. Therefore, electron microscopic autoradiography was 
performed for more accurate subcellular localization. Astrocytes 
and hippocampal neurons were examined for internalization of 1251-basic FGF (1 &ml, m 100,000 cpm/ng) after incubation for 
4 or 16 hr at 37°C. The qualitative results obtained by electron 
microscopy at these time points were indistinguishable. An ex- 
ample of an astrocyte is given in Figure 2A. Several grains can 
be seen lying over vesicular structures in the cytoplasm. These 
are some of the most frequently labeled structures at this time 
point. At higher magnification, the astrocyte cytoplasm can be 
seen to contain several structures that concentrate label. The 
most abundant are with the endosomal apparatus and lysosomes 
(Fig. 2B). The second most frequent localization was overlying 
cytoplasm, in the vicinity of vesicles and ribosomes. Unex- 2252 Walicke and Baird * Metabolism of Basic FGF by Neurons and Astrocytes

Hippocampal neurons (lanes 1-3) or astrocytes (lanes 4-6) were incu- 
bated with lzsI-basic FGF and extracted immediately after the binding 
assay (lanes I, 4), 4 hr after being returned to 37°C (lanes 2, 5), or 16 
hr at 37°C (lanes 3, 6). Molecular weights (in kDa) are indicated to the 
left. pectedly (Bouche et al., 1987; Baldin et al., 1990) label was not 
seen associated with the nucleolus but was detected overlying 
nuclear chromatin. For example, note the large collection of 
grains in the nucleus in the cell in Figure 2A. Label was never 
seen in association with mitochondria. 
In hippocampal neurons (Fig. 2C), autoradiographic grains 
are seen in the midst of the nuclear chromatin and near the 
margin of the cell. In Figure 20, label is seen in association with 
a neuritic process, in a cytoplasmic vesicle, and in the nuclear 
chromatin near the nuclear membrane. As with astrocytes, the 
most frequently labeled structures are cytoplasmic vesicles and 
lysosomes. Higher magnification (Fig. 2&F) reveals the second 
most frequent site of autoradiographic grains, over the cyto- 
plasm near vesicular structures. Finally, as with astrocytes, the 
third most common site is associated with the nuclear chro- 
matin. Label was not detected over mitochondria or the nucle- 
olus. 
Biochemical analyses of ‘25I-basic FGF binding. In other 
studies (Walicke et al., 1989), we have compared the high- and 
low-affinity receptors on neurons and astrocytes. Because the 
autoradiograms of labeled cells suggest that the basic FGF added 
to cells is long-lived, we attempted to perform a biochemical 
analysis of the 1251-basic FGF. Extraction and processing of the 
cells immediately after the binding incubation revealed the pres- 
ence of an 18-kDa doublet (Fig. 3, lanes 1, 4). After 16 hr at 
37°C (Fig. 3, lanes 3, 6) both neurons and astrocytes contain 
several smaller peptides ranging from 4 to 16 kDa. These pep- 
tides are all detectable in extracts of the astrocytes 4 hr after Al Neurons

binding (Fig. 3, lane 5). An analysis’by SDS-PAGE and auto- 
radiography of the neuron extract, however, shows that a ma- 
jority of the label is in the 15.5kDa protein at this time (Fig. 
3, lane 2). The appearance of the smaller peptide coincides with 
the disappearance of the basic FGF doublet. The dimerized form 
of basic FGF that is generated by storage (P. A. Walicke and 
A. Baird, unpublished observations) is readily detected in the 
starting material (Fig. 3, lanes 1, 4) This dimer, which cannot 
be reduced under the conditions of reducing SDS-PAGE, has a 
molecular weight of approximately 36 kDa and is observed at 
time 0 (Fig. 3, lanes 1, 4). Both neurons and astrocytes utilize 
this basic FGF dimer, as demonstrated by its disappearance 
after 4 hr in astrocytes (Fig. 3, lane 5) and its metabolism after 
16 hr in neurons (Fig. 3, lane 3). Accordingly, the basic FGF 
dimer is most likely active, a conclusion compatible with the 
fact that dimerization of standard basic FGF preparations does 
not decrease specific activity (Walicke and Baird, unpublished 
observations). 
The processing of basic FGF over 3 d in culture is shown in 
Figure 4. In extracts of neurons (Fig. 4A), the metabolism of 
basic FGF is barely detectable at 4-8 hr, but is robust at 16 hr. 
Between 48 and 72 hr after binding, there are no longer any 
metabolic products detectable, though there remain significant 
amounts of unprocessed basic FGF. In astrocytes (Fig. 4B), the 
smaller peptides are first detected after the cells have been re- 
turned to 37°C for 4 hr. They are found in increasing amounts 
when the cells are further incubated from 8 to 16 hr. The 2254 Walicke and Baird l Metabolism of Basic FGF by Neurons and Astrocytes

undetectable by 48 hr. 
Characterization of the metabolic products. Because the la- 
beled peptides detected in the cell extracts could be generated 
from free *251-tyrosine rather than being fragments of 1*51-basic 
FGF, cells were incubated with radiolabeled basic FGF for 16 
hr at 37°C after binding, and the extracts were then applied to 
a heparin-Sepharose column. The peptides eluting between 1 .O 
and 2.0 M NaCl were examined by SDS-PAGE and autora- 
diography. At least three heparin-binding peptides were present 
in this fraction (Fig. 5). The decreased background and the high- 
er resolution made it possible to establish that the basic FGF 
doublet is metabolized to a slightly lower-molecular-weight spe- 
cies of 15.5 kDa and at least two other smaller heparin-binding 
fragments of 5-10 kDa. 
These putative degradative fragments of basic FGF can be 
immunoprecipitated with a panel of antisera to confirm their 
derivation from basic FGF (Fig. 6). Astrocytes incubated with 
labeled basic FGF for 16 hr show three major metabolic prod- 
ucts (Fig. 6, lane 2). A series of six antisera were tested for their 
ability to immunoprecipitate these fragments: anti-basic FGF[ l- 
241, anti-basic FGF[30-501, anti-basic FGF[69-871, anti-basic 
FGF[ 106-l 201, anti-basic FGF[ 139-l 461, and an antiserum 
raised against bovine serum albumin. The last was used as a 
control because antisera were generated against peptides con- 
jugated to BSA. All anti-basic FGF antibodies immunoprecip- 
itate intact basic FGF (not shown). The 15.5-kDa protein is 
precipitated by four of the five antisera tested. The only anti- 
serum that failed to immunoprecipitate this band was anti-basic 
FGF[139-1461, suggesting that the first step in metabolism of 
basic FGF is the removal of the carboxyl terminal. The 9-kDa 
peptide was precipitated with anti-basic FGF[30-501 and anti- 
basic FGF[69-871, but not with anti-basic FGF[l-241 or anti- 
basic FGF[ 139-1461. Thus, this fragment contains a midportion 
sequence, somewhere between basic FGF[25-1051. Because the

shown). 
Localization of basic FGF metabolism. Most cells, including 
astrocytes and neurons, are known to secrete proteases into the 
culture medium. Therefore, the metabolism of basic FGF could 
potentially occur before, during, or after internalization. To in- 
vestigate this possibility, the extraction procedures were mod- 
ified to determine whether the labeled peptides. were metabo- 
lized extracellularly or intracellularly. After the binding assays, 
cells were first treated with trypsin to remove extracellular Y- 
basic FGF and to degrade membrane receptors (Moscatelli, 1987, 
1988; Moenner et al., 1989). Cells were then washed with 2.0 
M NaCl to remove any basic FGF bound to extracellular GAGS. 
Finally, the cells were extracted. As expected (Walicke et al., 
1989) the combined treatment with trypsin and 2 M NaCl re- 
moved 70-90% of the total basic FGF that was bound to the 
neurons and astrocytes if performed immediately after binding 
(Fig. 7). When the procedure was repeated on neurons or astro- 
cytes that had been incubated a further 16 hr at 3’7°C the amount 
of radioactivity recovered was the same with or without the 
trypsin and 2 M NaCl treatment. Thus, much more of the label 
is protected from extracellular proteases and salt 16 hr after 
binding, supporting the interpretation that the peptide frag- 
ments are intracellular. The treatments with trypsin and NaCl 
16 hr after the binding assay had no effect on the general pattern 
of iodinated basic FGF metabolism, though signal intensity is 
decreased (Fig. 8). 
Metabolism of basic FGF is mediated by its receptor. All stud- 
ies performed to date with mesenchymal or neuroectodermal 
cells suggest that there are two components of basic FGF bind- 
ing, a low-affinity component related to a cell-surface GAG and 
a glycoprotein high-affinity receptor. Accordingly, GAGS gen- 
erally bind most of the 12sI-basic FGF added to cells. The time- 
course studies show that about 75% of the counts that bind to 
cells at 4°C shift to an intracellular compartment when the cells 
are returned to 37°C for 16 hr (not shown). Because only 30- 
50% of this label is associated with high-affinity receptors during 26-

the binding assay (Walicke et al., 1989), the results suggest that, 
over the course of the following 16-hr incubation, the basic FGF 
associated with low-affinity receptors (i.e., GAG associated) is 
eventually internalized. To examine this possibility, the binding 
of lz51-basic FGF to GAGS was inhibited with heparin (Walicke 
et al., 1989), and the binding of 1251-basic FGF to high-affinity 
receptors was inhibited with WGA (Feige and Baird, 1988). 
Cells were exposed to lZ51-basic FGF in the presence of 100 
j&ml of either heparin or WGA during both the binding assay 
and the subsequent 16-hr incubation at 37’C, and SDS-PAGE 
autoradiography was performed on cell extracts to determine 
whether the degradative peptides were formed. As shown in 
Figure 9, the labeled fragments were detected in extracts of the 
untreated (Fig. 9, lanes 1, 4) and heparin-treated (lanes 2, 5) 
astrocytes and neurons. Processing of the cells that were incu- 
bated with WGA (lanes 3, 6) reveals the presence of very little 
peptide (intact basic FGF is readily detectable). Thus, the pep- 
tides are generated from the 1251-basic FGF internalized with 
their receptors. In contrast, though heparin decreased the in- 
tensity of the metabolized products, they were readily detect- 
able. 
Discussion 
The studies reported here suggest that neuroectodermal cells 
internalize and metabolize basic FGF in a manner similar to 
mesenchymal cells (Moenner et al., 1987, 1989; Moscatelli, 
1988). After internalization, basic FGF is processed into several 
specific peptides that remain associated with the cells for long 
periods after binding. This processing is distinctly different than 
observed for most polypeptide growth factors that appear to be 
metabolized within minutes of internalization. The detection of 2256 Walicke and Baird - Metabolism of Basic FGF by Neurons and Astrocytes

basic FGF in the nucleus supports the elegant studies of Boucht 
and coworkers (Bouche et al., 1987; Baldin et al., 1990). How- 
ever, we consistently failed to see basic FGF in the nucleolus. 
Rather, our results support the findings of several investigators 
(Logan, 1990; Renko et al., 1990) who have suggested that basic 
FGF can be translocated to the nucleus, where it has further 
activities. The findings reported here support this notion and 
suggest that there exists a specific interaction between basic FGF 
(or a metabolic fragment) and chromatin. To our knowledge, 
this is the first demonstration of the internalization of basic 
FGF into the nucleus of a CNS cell. Perhaps even more im- 
portantly, the results establish the fact that basic FGF acts di- 
rectly on neurons. 
The metabolic fragments of basic FGF produced by CNS cells 
were not isolated and sequenced. Even so, several inferences 
about their identity can be made. These are summarized in 
Figure 10. The 15.5-kDa peptide lacks the normal carboxyl 
terminus, a transformation that may alter heparin binding ac- 
tivity (Seno et al., 1990). The 9-kDa peptide contains sequences 
found between amino acids 30 and 87, but its apparent molec- 
ular weight suggests that it may include a somewhat larger re- 
gion. Failure to immunoprecipitate this peptide with the anti- 1-24 30-50 66.67 106-120 139-146

Figure 10. Proposed metabolism of basic FGF by neurons and astro- 
cytes. Based on the molecular weights of the immunoprecipitated met- 
abolic products of basic FGF, a scheme can be outlined whereby the 
processing of basic FGF occurs initially at the C-terminus and is fol- 
lowed by amino terminal cleavage to yield a radiolabeled C-terminal 
fragment. 
serum to basic FGF( l-24) establishes that the amino terminus 
has been deleted. Accordingly, the predicted peptide has the 
protein kinase C (PKC) consensus sequence present in basic 
FGF (Feige et al., 1989; Feige and Baird, 199 1) at residue Ser64. 
The apparent molecular weight of the 4-kDa fragment that con- 
tains the 106-l 20 epitope suggests that it contains further por- 
tions of the basic FGF sequence, possibly as much as basic 
FGF(87-139). This peptide contains the consensus sequence for 
protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent phosphorylation (Feige et 
al., 1989; Feige and Baird, 199 1) and a cryptic site for PKC 
(Feige et al., 199 1) that is phosphorylated on peptide fragments 
but not on intact basic FGF. Because the degradation to these 
fragments may generate cryptic heparin binding and phosphor- 
ylation sites that could confer activity, it will be imperative to 
identify the fragments. 
Several investigators have proposed that basic FGF bound 
by extracellular matrix serves as a stable reservoir in tissues 
(Baird and Ling, 1987; Vlodavsky et al., 1987; Folkman et al., 
1988; Baird and Walicke, 1989). It was thus interesting to note 
that one interpretation of the results obtained with exogenous 
heparin and WGA is that basic FGF is delivered to the receptor 
by cell-associated GAGS. When WGA inhibits high-affinity re- 
ceptor binding, it selectively inhibits the metabolism of basic 
FGF. As expected, the amount of 12SI-basic FGF internalized 
is accordingly decreased. When heparin is used to inhibit the 
binding to low-affinity receptor, the metabolism of basic FGF 
is unaffected, but there is a significant decrease in the amounts 
of label internalized. 
The intracellular metabolism of basic FGF generates two ma- 
jor fragments of basic FGF that contain the middle portion of 
the molecule and thus the receptor binding sites (Baird et al., 
1988). This specific pattern of metabolism coupled with the 
long-lived nature of the peptide fragments generated raises the 
interesting possibility that the peptides can serve as intracellular 
and even intranuclear (Baldin et al., 1990; Renko et al., 1990) 
signals. It is thus of more than passing interest that the frag- 
mentation pattern cleaves basic FGF into one peptide that is a 
substrate for the phospholipid-dependent kinase PKC and a 
second peptide that is a substrate for the CAMP-dependent ki- 
nase PKA (Feige and Baird, 1989, 1991; Feige et al., 1989, 
1991). With this knowledge, it is possible that the phosphory- 
lation of basic FGF is involved in the processes that mediate 
basic FGF activity, a possibility that can easily be addressed by 
site-directed mutagenesis. 
It is also important to note that, though equal cell numbers 
were used in these experiments, astrocytes consistently metab- The Journal of Neuroscience, July 1991, 1 I(7) 2257 
olized basic FGF faster than neurons. Although the significance Feige JJ, Baird A (1988) Glycosylation of the basic fibroblast growth 
of this finding is not clear, it may reflect the differences between 
the FGF receptor of each cell type (Walicke et al., 1989). On this 
basis, it is interesting to speculate that the measurement of these 
basic FGF fragments in the CNS could be used to determine 
whether the neurotrophic factor is being metabolized in vivo. 
The recent observations of Carmen et al. (1990) support such 
a hypothesis. These investigators examined the fate of basic 
FGF injected into the CNS and found that, while at the time 
of injection basic FGF binds to the parenchyma, it diffuses along 
adjacent fiber tracts and is present for at least 7 d as an 18-kDa 
protein. Four days after the injection, however, the presence of 
the same metabolic fragments as those described here are de- 
tected (A. Gonzales and A. Bird, unpublished observations). 
The availability of antisera to measure these fragments specif- 
ically could thus permit investigators to study the kinetics of 
basic FGF metabolism during CNS injury, ischemia, and per- 
haps even in the neurodegenerative disease in which basic FGF 
has been implicated (Stopa et al., 1990). This approach would 
thus enable investigators to distinguish between ubiquitous 
presence of the mitogen when it is being sequestered in tissues 
and its presence when it is being actively metabolized. factor receptor. The contribution ofcarbohydrate to receptor function.
