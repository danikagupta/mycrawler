ABSTRACT  
 
Degradation of azo dyes by  pure and mixed bacterial strains of Pseudomonas , Bacillus , Staphylococcus  and 
Micrococcus  strain was studied. These strains grew in nutrient broth supplemented with Indosole Yellow BG, Indosole 
Black G and Indosole Brilliant Red BA with specific growth rates of 0.28 h-1, 0.31 h-1and 0.44 h-1, respectively. Very 
low percentage (i.e. < 5%) of azo  dyes was removed in mineral salts medium (MM) by pure bacterial strains. Mixed 
culture degraded azo dyes n ot more than 20% in MM medium. The d egradation was enhanced when a cosubstrate (i.e. 
glucose) was supplemented in the MM medium containing azo dyes w ith bacterial consortia. Decolorisation of over 
95% of azo dyes with mixed culture was observed when glucose was added with azo dyes in MM medium. Different 
concentrations of azo dyes (i.e. 10 mg/ L and 20 mg/ L) were degraded in MM medium supplemented with the same 
concentration of glucose with almost similar degradation rates.  
 
Key words:  Azo dyes, biodegradation,  decolorisation, cosubstrate, mixed culture, kinetics  
 
INTRODUCTION  
 
Humans are using colorants and dyes for over a hundred years. Currently, over 700,000 tons of colorants are 
being produced on yearly basis (Zollinger 1987). It has been estimated that over 10,000 different dyes and pigments 
are used in making different products in textile and paint industries (McMullan et al. , 2001). Because of cha nging 
nature and huge volume of textile effluents, dyes are very difficult to remove with a single conventional treatment 
technology (O’Neill et al. , 1999). Azo dyes are the largest group of dyes used in textile industries, mainly due to the 
simple synthes is (Jianbo  et al. , 2010;  Pandey  et al. , 2007). Therefore, removal of azo dyes from the industrial 
effluents is necessary for preventing contamination of soil and water.  
Previously, various methods have been adapted  to remove azo dyes with physical technol ogies (i.e. adsorption, 
chemical precipitation, membrane separation (Carriere et al. , 1993 ; McKay 1980), c oagulation/flocculation, and 
ozonation (van der Zee 2002) and chemical treatment (i.e. oxidation, reduction, and adsorption by activated 
charcoal ) (Li and Bishop 2004). These methods are not only expensive but also generate toxic wastes that are more 
difficult to treat and dispose (Moutaouakkil  et al. , 2004).  
A wide variety of microbial species such as bacteria and fungi are found to remove azo dyes fro m textile 
effluents during waste treatment. Fungal strains isolated from textile effluents are reported to degrade azo dyes. For 
example,  Aspergillus  niger  SA1 decolorized over 98% Acid Red 151 (Ali et al.,  2008) and Aspergillus  terreus  SA3 
efficiently uti lized Sulfur Black by removing 85% of color and 75% COD ( Andleeb  et al., 2010) by fungal growth 
and hyphal uptake mechanism under different physicochemical conditions. There are only a few bacteria that are 
able to grow on azo dyes as the sole carbon sourc e. However, mixed bacterial strains can completely remove azo 
dyes (Liu et al. , 2007; Patil  et al., 2008; Tony et al., 2009). In this study we have isolated four different types of 
bacterial strains and tested pure and mixed culture for their potential to degrade azo dyes  in synthetic media.

Culture medium and g rowth conditions  
All bacterial isolations were cultivated at room temperature (28 -35°C) on nutrient broth (Merck, Germany) and 
mineral salts medium (MM) with composition (g/ L) as shown in Table 1. S. ADNAN HASAN ET AL.,

Trace elements solution contained per litre 780 mg of Ca(NO 3)2.4H 2O, 200 m g of FeSO 4.7H 2O, 20 mg of 
Na2SeO 4.10H 2O, 10 mg of  ZnSO 4.7H 2O, 10 mg of H 3BO 3, 10 mg of CoCl 2.6H 2O, 10 mg of CuSO 4.5H 2O, 4 mg of 
MnSO 4.H2O, 3 mg of Na 2MoO 4.2H 2O and 2 mg of NiCl 2.6H 2O. The pH of MM medium was adjusted at 7.0.  
 
Enrichment and isolati on of a zo dye degrading strains  
In order to isolate potential azo dye degraders, wastewater samples were collected from primary sedimentation 
tank and activated sludge of a treatment plant of a textile company situated at Korangi Industrial Area, Karachi. 
Bacteri al strains able to grow on azo dyes were isolated from the liquid sludge made by mixing waste water and 
activated sludge samples in MM  medium . Enrichment s of dye degrading microorganisms were  done in serum 
bottle s (250 ml) by mixing 50 ml liquid sludge in 5 0 ml MM containing 500 mg/ L of azo dye under non -shaking 
conditions a t room temperature . Three  different dyes (i.e. Indosole Yellow BG, Indosole black G and Indosole 
brilliant red BA)  were selected in this study.  
Each serum bottle contained a single dye ke pt at room temperature.  After every 15 -20 days 10 ml samples of 
the suspensions were transferred to new flasks containing fresh MM medium with 500 ppm of respective azo dye. 
Growth of azo dye degraders was followed by visual observation of dye removal. Aft er 2-3 serial transfers, 
approximately 50 -60% dye removal was observed in selected dyes . The decrease  in color intensity indicated the 
ability of strains to grow on azo dyes. Pure bacterial cultures were obtained by repetitive streaking onto nutrient 
broth  (NB) plates with growth checks in MM medium with respective dyes.  
 
Identification of isolated strains  
Five morphologically different isolates were obtained. The isolates were identif ied on the basis of cell shape, 
cell arrangement, gram staining, relation  to oxygen, nutritional characteristics, physiological and biochemical 
characteristics  (Sivaraj  et al. , 2011 ; John et al., 2000). The isolated strains were maintained on nutrient agar slants 
and stab cultures were preserved at 4oC. 
 
Azo dyes measurements  
The decolorisation  of azo dyes in MM  medium  was monitored by measuring the optical densities (ODs) of the 
dye solutions at their respective absorbance maxima  (i.e., Indosole Yellow BG, 560 nm; Indosole black G, 480 nm 
and Indosole brilliant red BA, 530 nm)  using spectrophotometer.  A loopful of culture from each plate specific for 
the dye was inoculated in serum bottles containing 100 ml MM  medium  and 10mg/L  of dye. The bottles were kept 
at room temperature and observed for color reduction by withdraw ing samp les after every 24 h . The samples (1 -
1.5ml) were centr ifuged at 13,000 rpm for 3 min . The distilled water was used as a blank. The pellets were 
resuspended in distilled water and their ODs were  monitored  at 600nm.  
The efficiency of color removal was expres sed as the percentage of the decolorized dye concentration to that of 
the initial one. Decolorisation activity was calculated as follows:  
 
 
Where, Ai = initial absorbance, Af = final absorbance  
 
Cosubstrate as a parallel carbon source  
Biodegradation of az o dyes by pure and mixed culture s was also studied by adding glucose as a cosubstrate  in 
the MM medium. Glucose was added into the mineral media at  the concentrations equal or double  the 
concentrations to the azo -dyes in parallel experimental setup. In all  cases, other growth conditions like temperature, 
pH and mic ro-aerophilic conditions were kept constant.  The medium was overlaid with paraffin oil in order to create 
partially anaerobic condition s. The flasks were incubated at 35 °C. Samples were drawn afte r every 24 h  to observed  
ecolorisation by reading a bsorbance at λ max for each dye.  BIODEGRADATION OF AZO DYES BY BACTERIA

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
 
Biodegradation of azo dyes  
Biodegradation of three different azo dyes (Indosole Black G, Indosole Red BA, and Indosole Yellow BG) by 
exploring the optimizing conditions (i.e., type of cosubstrate supp lemented with azo dyes, different concentrations 
of cosubstrate and temperature variations) for these dyes is studied. The effects of mixed and pure culture on azo 
dye degradation were also explored.  
 
Identification and characterization of isolated azo -dye degraders  
Identification of the azo dye degrading bacterial isolates was done up to the level of genus by performing Gram 
staining, motility test, biochemical tests (i.e. Indole, Methyl Red, Voges -Proskeur, citrate, catalase and nitrate 
reduction tests) as described in the Burges’s manual of determinative bacteriology.  Assimilation of various sugars 
such as lactose, glucose, sucrose and maltose was determined by inoculating the isolates into sugar broth 
supplemented with respective sugar for 24 hours at 37 °C. 
The isolates were identified as Pseudomonas sp. (AZ-1, AZ -4 and AZ -5), Staphylococcus sp. (AZ -2) 
andBacillussp. (AZ -3) (Fig. 1). Pure and mixed cultures of these isolated strains were used to study the growth and 
degradation kinetics of azo dyes. Pseudo monas  and Bacillus  species are well known for their ability to decolorize 
azo dyes .Pseudomonas  S-42 was capable of decolorizing Drimerin Brilliant Orange RR (DBO -RR), Direct Brown 
M (DBM), Eriochro me Brown R (EBR) and many more ( Sheng and Bao 1989 ). P. put ida MET94 removed  more 
than 80% of the structurally diverse azodye  in 24 h under anaerobic conditions (Mendes et al.,2011). Acid Orange 
52, which is extensively used in textile industries, was decolorized by Pseudomonas  putida  mt-2 (Mansour et al., 
2011). Rapid biodegradation  and decolorisation of Direct Orange 39 was observed by Pseudomonas  aeruginosa  
strain BCH (Jadhav  et al., 2010). Decolorisation of orange MR was carried out by Micrococcus  sp. DBS 2 ( Rajee 
and Patterson 2011). Degradation of azo dyes wi th an NADH -dependent azoreductase of Bacillus  sp. st rain SF has 
also been reported ( Maier et al., 2004).

and Pseudomonas sp. AZ-5). S. ADNAN HASAN ET AL.,

Biode gradation of azo dyes using pure culture  
The pure cultures of isolated strains were separately inocula ted into 120 ml flasks containing 50 ml MM 
medium supplemented with azo dyes  and incubated at optimum growth conditions (temperature 35-37°C and pH 
7±2). Over a period of 15 days, slight decrease in color intensity  (up to 2%) was observed . The decrease in  dye 
concentration was not significant (i.e., < 5%) when flasks were incubated for 45 days  in the same physical 
conditions . 
Very few researchers have observed that pure culture was able to bring about a high level of decolorisation of 
azo dyes. However, i n many bioremediation studies, mixed bacterial cultures have proved to be superior to single 
pure cultures  (Khalid et al ., 2010 ). The reason being the nature of azo dyes in which first step of degradation 
requires anaerobic and then aerobic conditions for the  stepwise degradation.  
 
Biodegradation of azo dyes using mixed culture in nutrient broth  
Growth kinetics of mixed cultures of five different cultures degrading its respective dye s was studied  by 
inoculating the strains in flasks containing nutrient broth  supplemented with azo dyes . All mixed culture s showed 
different growth pattern s in nutrient b roth. Cultures for dyes I ndosole Black G and I ndosole Yellow BG had  
steady growth curve s showing a stable log phase with specific  growth rates of 0.28 h-1 and 0.31 h-1, respectively. 
While cultures degradedIndosole Brilliant Red BA had rapid and short log phase  with specific growth  rate of 0.44 
h-1 (Fig. 2).

Biodegradation of azo dyes using mixed culture in  mineral salts medium  (MM)  
Biodegradation of azo dyes was also studied by mixed culture in MM medium . Samples were drawn after every 
24 h for monitoring growth and degradation . During the first stage of biodegradation, azo dyes alone are a very 
difficult s ubstrate for microorganisms to utilize as carbon source unless there is another carbon source present in the 
medium. This is due to the complex structure of the azo dyes. Azo dyes often have a very complex structure and due 
to this structural complexity, t hey are resistant to attack by microbial enzymes and hence are recalcitrant. Not more 
than 20%  decrease in color  intensity was observed  (Table 2) indicating that inoculated bacterial strains were unable 
to completely degrade azo dyes.

Biodegradation of azo dyes in MM medium supplemented with co -substrates using mixed culture  
Complete biodegradation of azo dyes was not observed unless a cosubstrate was added with the azo dyes in 
MM medium (Fig. 3). Similar  observations have been reported previously by other researchers that a very little 
decolorisation of azo dyes was observed when cosubstrate was not added in MM medium ( Kuhn and Suflita 1989; 
Tan 2001 and Stolz  2001) .It was reported that c omplete removal o f Basic Red 46 and Methylene Blue without 
supplementation of a cosubstrate took a longer time (2 h) and degraded partially (10 -15%) (Sarioglu and Bisgin 
2009).

medium with and without supplementation of cosubstrate. High intensityof the dye colors indicatedegradation without cosubstrate and light color 
indicates with cosubstrate  
 
Addition of glucose as a co substrate  
Respective mixed cultures  degraded up to 95% of 10 mg/l (Fig. 4A) and 20 mg/l ( Fig. 4B) of Indosole Black G  
in 100 h , 85% of 10 mg/l  (Fig. 4C) and 20 mg/l ( Fig. 4D) of Indosole Brilliant Red BA in 200 h and 90% of 10 mg/l  
(Fig. 4E) and 20 mg/l (Fig . 4F) of Indosole Yellow BG in 100 h in separate flasks in MM medium supplemented with 
glucose  as much as azo dyes . Enhanced biodegradation of azo dyes in the presence of cosubstrate  has been reported 
frequently by many researchers  (Field et al., 1995 ; Sarioglu 2009 ; Taj 2009 ; Maddhinni  et al., 2006 ; Telke et al., 
2008 ; Khalid et al., 2011). Using glucose as cosubstrate, 90% of Methylene Blue  (Field  et al., 1995 ; Sarioglu  and 
Bisgin,  2009),  94% of Orange II in 45 min ( Taj, 2009 ), up to 80 % of Remazol Black -B (Khalid et al., 2011 ), 70% 
Direct yellow 12 in 105 min (Maddhinni  et al., 2006 ), 70% Triphenylmethane dyes (Field et al., 1995)  and complete 
biodegradation of Basic Red 46 in 25 hours (Sarioglu and Bisgin,  2009)  were  degraded . This indicates that an 
additional carbon s ource is required in the medium to accelerate the degradation of azo dyes.  
The concentration of cosubstrate is also an important factor which affects the biodegradation of azo dyes. 
Therefore, different concentrations of glucose were added to the MM mediu m to study the biodegradation of azo 
dyes. Similar degradation rates were observed when 20 mg/l each of Indosole Black G, Indosole Brilliant Red BA  
and Indosole Yellow BG were degraded in MM medium supplemented with equal concentrations of glucose (Fig. 4)  
by maintaining similar growth conditions. Hence, increased cosubstrate concentration reduced the chances of growth 
inhibition that is usually caused due to increased concentration of a carbon source.  This could be reasoned that the 
presence of anaerobic e nvironment during the first stage of biodegradation is very important. In most of the cases of 
biodegradation of azo dyes studied so far,  azo dye reduction is very difficult to occur in an aerobic environment. A 
cosubstrate helps degrading azo dyes by i) r eleasing electrons that are used by azo reductases for cleavage of azo 
bond (Hong et al., 2007) and ii) creating anaerobic micro niches in the medium , thereby accelerating the degradation 
process under anaerobic conditions (Tan, 2001) . Therefore, paraffin oil was used to coat the surface of the medium 
to establish and maintain anaerobic environment.  
During this research, some inadequacies also appeared. One of the limitations was that the information about 
the structure of dyes studied was not provided. Th is created problem in the study of the aromatic amines produced 
during anaerobic degradation (first step of azo dye degradation). The aromatic amines could not be identified and 
the mineralization of these metabolites also could not be followed. Also the r esidual concentration of the dye after 
treatment could not be determined. However, the approach of biodegradation of the azo dyes was successful. All 
dyes were degraded up to 80 -100% but further study of the metabolites of the dye and their mineralization is only 
possible if the dye structure is known.  S. ADNAN HASAN ET AL.,
