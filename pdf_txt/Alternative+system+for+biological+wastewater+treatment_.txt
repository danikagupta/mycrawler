Microalgae  are  able  to  convert  nutrients  (nitrogen  and  phosphorus)  from  wastewater  into  biomass  and
bio-products,  thus  improving  the  sustainability  of  wastewater  treatment.  In  High  Rate  Algal  Ponds
(HRAP),  biomass  productivity  and  water  treatment  efﬁciency  are  highly  dependent  on  environmental
parameters  such  as  temperature,  light  intensity  and  photoperiod.  The  inﬂuence  of  temperature  and
photoperiod  on  biomass  productivity  and  the  removal  of  dissolved  nitrogen  and  phosphorus  from
municipal  wastewater  by  a  native  microalgae-bacteria  consortium  was  assessed  in  batch  cultures  in  view
of  the  development  of  an  HRAP  at  a  larger  scale.  Temperature  affected  the  growth  rate  and  microalgae
biomass  production  as  well  as  ammonium  and  phosphate  removal  rates.  At  the  temperatures  15  and
25/C14C,  the  average  total  nitrogen  and  phosphorus  removal  extents  ranged  from  72  to  83%  and  100%
respectively.  Additionally  33.0  /C6  0.1%  of  the  total  nitrogen  was  eliminated  by  stripping  at  25/C14C,  and
50  /C6  2%  was  assimilated  by  the  microorganisms  under  all  conditions  tested.

1.  Introduction
Microalgae  have  been  at  the  focus  of  attention  in  recent  years  as
an  alternative  system  for  biological  wastewater  treatment  with
several  applications  in  wastewater  treatment  [1–5].  Microalgae  are
photosynthetic  microorganisms  that  can  grow  rapidly  and  live  in
harsh  conditions  due  to  their  unicellular  or  simple  multicellular
structure  [6].  They  provide  a  way  for  contaminants-removal
(nitrogen,  phosphorus  and  carbon)  from  wastewater  while
producing  biomass  that  could  ﬁnd  use  for  the  production  of
high-value  chemicals  (algal  metabolites)  and/or  biogas  through
anaerobic  digestion  [7].  Additionally,  microalgae  can  diminish  the
harmful  effects  of  sewage  efﬂuent  and  reduce  eutrophication  in
aquatic  environments  [8].  Wang  et  al.  [9]  reported  a  decrease  in
nitrogen  (83%  N  as  NH 4+)  and  phosphorus  (90%  P  as  PO43/C0)  in
municipal  wastewater  by  Chlorella  sp.  They  suggested  that  the
nutrient  removal  rates  were  independent  of  the  optimal  N/P  ratio
but  that  the  concentrations  of  these  nutrients  were  important  for
the  algal  growth  systems.  In  another  study,  Samori  et  al.  [10]
clearly  demonstrated  the  high  potential  of  using  an  isolated  algal
strain  from  an  artiﬁcial  freshwater  pond,  Desmodesmus  communis ,to  remove  contaminants  from  primary  wastewater.  These  photo-
synthetic  microorganisms  can  potentially  provide  oxygen  for  the
heterotrophic  aerobic  bacteria  that  could  in  turn  biodegrade
organic  pollutants  from  municipal  wastewater  and  release  carbon
dioxide  to  be  used  by  the  microalgae  in  the  presence  of  light.  It
must  be  born  in  mind  that  microalgae  can  exhibit  many  types  of
metabolism  (e.g.  autotrophic,  heterotrophic,  mixotrophic,  photo-
heterotophic)  and  are  capable  of  metabolic  shift  in  response  to
changes  in  environmental  conditions  [6],  hence  they  may  compete
with  heterotrophic  bacteria  [11]  under  certain  conditions.  The  net
pollutant  removal  in  these  systems  is  basically  the  additive  effect
of  their  assimilation  by  the  algal  [5,12] ,  biological  processes
(nitri ﬁcation/denitri ﬁcation)  and  stripping  phenomena  such  as
ammonia  volatilization  and  phosphorus  precipitation.  The  latter  is
potentially  brought  about  by  the  high  pH  levels  induced  through
photosynthetic  microalgal  growth  [7,9,13] .  The  efﬁciency  of  the
algae-bacteria  consortium  for  nutrient  uptake  is  not  only  affected
by  the  bioavailability  of  nutrients  but  also  depends  on  the  complex
interactions  between  physico-chemical  factors  such  as  pH,  light
intensity,  photoperiod,  temperature  and  biological  factors.  Exam-
ples  of  the  latter  are  the  presence  of  pathogen,  viral  attack,
protozoa  predation  and  competition  with  bacteria  over  the
available  nutrients  [14–16].
Mixed  bacteria-microalgae  cultures  are  often  grown  in  high  rate
algal  ponds  (HRAPs)  to  treat  municipal,  industrial  and/or*  Corresponding  author.

agricultural  wastewaters.  HRAP  technology  essentially  consists  of  a
shallow  race-track  reactor  of  0.3–0.4  m  in  depth,  with  mechanical
mixing,  in  which  algae  and  bacteria  grow.  The  wastewater,  usually
primary  or  secondary,  is  fed  into  the  HRAP  and  mixed  with  the
algal  and  bacterial  culture  inside  the  bioreactor.  Stirring  promotes
algal  growth  and  prevents  biomass  settling  [17].  Studies  have  been
carried  out  to  understand  the  inﬂuence  of  the  various  parameters
in  HRAP  and  to  explain  how  these  parameters  can  improve  the
microalgal  performance  at  larger  scales.  Hidiyanto  et  al.  [18]
developed  a  hydrodynamic  model  of  HRAP  and  showed  that  a  ratio
L/W  (length/width)  higher  than  10  allowed  better  performance
with  respect  to  velocity  uniformity  and  reduced  shear  stresses;
Sutherland  et  al.  [19]  indicated  that  the  overall  areal  productivity
signiﬁcantly  increased  with  increasing  depth  (200,  300  and
400  mm).  Kim  et  al.  [20]  demonstrated  high  removal  efﬁciencies
for  COD  (86%),  total  nitrogen  (93%)  and  total  phosphorus  (83%)
from  untreated  municipal  wastewater  in  an  algae  dominated
consortium  in  a  HRAP.
Critical  parameters,  such  as  light  intensity,  photoperiod,
temperature  and  pH  affect  HRAP  wastewater  treatment  and
biomass  production.  For  instance,  the  photoperiod  and  the
temperature  are  subject  to  large  seasonal  variations  with  a
consequent  effect  on  wastewater  treatment  efﬁciency  and  biomass
productivity  that  ﬂuctuate  all  year  round.  Recently,  Lee  et  al.  [21]
showed  that  the  photoperiod  impacts  greatly  on  nutrient  removal,
biomass  production  and  alters  algal-bacterial  population  dynamics
in  a  photo-bioreactor  used  for  municipal  wastewater  treatment.
Understanding  the  effects  of  environmental  parameters
(temperature,  light  .  .  .  )  on  biotic  and  abiotic  phenomena  is  a
major  way  to  improve  and  optimize  HRAPs  performance.
In  this  preliminary  work,  the  effect  of  both  temperature  and
photoperiod  on  microalgae  biomass  production  and  pollutant
removal  (soluble  nitrogen  and  phosphorus)  from  municipal
wastewater  was  investigated.  A  native  microalgae-bacteria
consortium  originating  from  a  pilot  HRAP  was  assessed  with  a
view  to  improve  the  HRAP  pilot  plant ’s  performance  in  pollutant
removal.
2.  Material  and  methods
2.1.  Preparation  of  an  active  microalgal-bacteria  inoculum
The  microbial  biomass  used  in  all  batch  experiments  was
obtained  from  a  HRAP  pilot  plant  in  Pau  (France).  The  microbial
consortium  (microalgae,  bacteria  and  other  microscopic  organ-
isms)  collected  was  ﬁrstly  allowed  to  settle  for  2  h  and  the  settled
solids  were  used  as  an  “enriched  microbial  biomass  inoculum ”.  The
wastewater  collected  from  another  similar  pilot  plant  (Ouistreham
/C0  France)  was  clariﬁed  through  centrifugation  (2000 g;  10  min)  and
used  as  the  nutrient  medium  for  batch  experiments.
The  enriched  microbial  biomass  was  used  to  inoculate  (10%  v/v)
the  clariﬁed  nutrient  medium  (2900  mL).  This  culture  was
continuously  stirred  (35  /C2  6  mm  magnetic  stirrer;  100  rpm)  in  an
Erlenmeyer  ﬂask  under  continuous  illumination  (45  mmol  s/C01m/C02
at  the  culture  surface  with  ﬂuorescent  lamps,  Biolux  OSRAMJ  30W/
965)  and  was  maintained  at  room  temperature  (approx.  20/C14C).  The
constant  mixing  served  to  avoid  sedimentation.
2.2.  Wastewater  characteristics
The  municipal  wastewater  (primary  efﬂuent)  used  in  the  batch
experiments  was  obtained  from  the  inlet  into  the  HRAP  at
Ouistreham  (France).  The  typical  composition  of  this  water  is
described  in  Table  1.2.3.  Batch  experiments
Batch  experiments  lasted  8  days  and  were  performed  in  open
Duran  (Schott)  bottles  (250  mL;  200  mL  working  volume;  7  cm
culture  depth).  The  system  consisted  of  15  stirred  ﬂasks,  immersed
in  a  water-bath  attemperated  by  means  of  water  recirculation
through  a  chiller-heater  (Frigomix  U-1/Thermomix  BU).  Illumina-
tion  was  provided  from  above  the  ﬂasks  using  ﬂuorescent  lamps
(4/C2  Mazda ﬂuor  18  W)  at  200 –250  mmol  m/C02s/C01measured  at  the
surface  of  the  cultures  (Licor  LI250A,  LI-COR,  USA).
The  reproducibility  of  the  replicates  was  estimated  by  starting
15  identical  cultures  of  Chlorella  vulgaris  in  modi ﬁed  Bristol
medium  (20/C14C;  photoperiod  12  h)  and  estimating  the  microalgal
growth  (as  indicated  in  Section  2.4,  by  the  total  concentration  of
chlorophyll  a  and  b)  in  all  the  bottles.  In  our  conditions,  chlorophyll
concentration  was  revealed  as  an  indirect  measure  of  the  algal
biomass  in  the  wastewater  (see  Section  2.4).  A  standard  deviation
of  7.60%  of  the  values  of  the  apparent  speci ﬁc  growth  rate,  based  on
chlorophyll  measurements,  for  the  15  cultures  was  determined
indicating  a  good  reproducibility  between  the  cultures  in  the
incubation  system.  In  other  words,  there  was  no  inﬂuence  of  the
position  of  the  bottles  in  the  water  bath  on  the  results.
After  conﬁrming  the  positional  uniformity  of  the  incubator,  ﬁve
experiments  were  performed  at  different  temperatures  and
photoperiods.  Each  experiment  contained  duplicate  cultures
randomly  placed  in  the  incubator.  The  temperatures  (5,  15  and
25/C14C)  and  photoperiods  (6,  12  and  18  h  of  light)  were  chosen  to
mimic  average  winter  and  summer  conditions  in  the  open-pond  of
Ouistreham  (Table  2).  The  “photoperiod ”  refers  to  the  length  of
continuous  illumination  applied  to  the  cultures  during  any  24  h
period.  In  the  following,  when  referring  to  cultures  conditions
(Bi–ii),  i  refers  to  the  temperature  and  ii  the  photoperiod.
In  addition  two  control  experiments  were  performed:  (a)  Batch
cultures  in  obscurity  and  (b)  Abiotic  cultures  without  inoculation.
These  experiments  were  performed  to  assess  the  impacts  of
microbial  respiration,  nitriﬁcation  and  abiotic  losses  (nutrient
stripping  and  precipitation).  Batch  cultures  were  performed  in
obscurity  at  5,15  and  25/C14C  (referred  to  as  B5,  B15  and  B25).  In  order
to  measure  ammonia  volatilization  and  phosphorus  precipitation
the  abiotic  experiments  were  performed  at  15/C14C  and  a
photoperiod  of  18  h.  These  cultures  were  prepared  with  successive
ﬁltrations  (1.2  mm  and  0.2  mm)  of  the  nutrient  medium  to  remove
the  biomass.  This  experiment  was  repeated  at  two  different  pH
values;  unmodi ﬁed  (pH  /C25  8)  and  strongly  alkaline  (pH  =  10.0  with
addition  of  NaOH  2  mol  L/C01).  The  latter  pH  corresponded  to  the
value  routinely  encountered  at  the  end  of  the  experiments.
2.4.  Analytical  methods
Daily  samples  were  collected  at  the  same  time  of  the  day  (at  the
beginning  of  the  light  cycle)  and  were  analysed  according  to  the
Standards  Methods  for  Examination  of  Water  and  Wastewater  [22].

(DO),  temperature,  concentrations  of  chlorophyll  (a  and  b),
concentrations  of  ammonium  (NH 4+),  nitrite  (NO 2/C0),  nitrate
(NO 3/C0)  and  phosphate  (PO 43/C0),  particulate  nitrogen  (Np)  content
of  the  biomass,  total  suspended  solids  (TSS)  and  volatile  suspended
solids  (VSS).  The  pH  measurements  were  carried  out  twice  a  day.
Data  on  pH  represent  the  highest  value  of  the  two  measurements
of  the  day  day  (à  supprimer).
The  temperature,  DO  and  pH  were  measured  with  the
multiparameter  probe  ODEON  (SN/C0/C0ODOEA-0175),  an  oxygen
sensor  (SN-PODOA-0180)  and  a  pH  sensor  (SN-PPHRA-0144)
respectively.  The  concentrations  of  the  dissolved  nitrogen  species
(NH 4+,  NO 2/C0,  NO 3/C0)  and  PO43/C0were  determined  using  an  Ion
Chromatograph  (DIONEX  LC25-LC20).  The  anions  were  separated
using  an  Ion  Pac  AS11-HC  analytical  column  and  NaOH  (30  mM  /C0
Dionex  LC25)  as  eluent.  The  cations  were  separated  using  an  IonPac
CS12A  analytical  column  and  methanesulfonic  acid  (20  mN  /C0
Dionex  LC20)  as  eluent.  The  particulate  nitrogen  content  (Np)  of  the
biomass  was  determined  by  elemental  analysis  (Organic  Elemental
Analyzer  FLASH  2000CHNS/O,  base  unit  operated  with  helium).
TSS  and  VSS  were  determined  by  ﬁltration  of  the  suspension  and
heating  the  solid  at  105/C14C  and  at  550/C14C,  respectively.
Microalgal  growth  was  monitored  by  measuring  the  total
chlorophyll  concentration  (Chl;  mg  L/C01)  during  the  experiment.
The  chlorophyll  concentration  was  determined  by  a  modi ﬁed
method  proposed  by  Porra  [23]  with  extraction  of  chlorophyll  a
and  b  with  a  85%  methanol  aqueous  solution  containing  1.5  mM  of
sodium  dithionite  at  40/C14C.  The  chlorophyll  concentration  was
calculated  from  the  absorbance  of  the  extracted  solution  at
650  and  664  nm  (Spectrophotometer  Cary  50  Scan  UV–vis).  Under
our  conditions,  the  chlorophyll  and  biomass  (VSS)  concentrations
were  well  correlated  (R2=  0.99)  over  the  range  observed  in  our
experiments  (50–400  mg/L).
The  apparent  speci ﬁc  growth  rate  (m)  and  the  algal  biomass
productivity  (PB)  were  calculated  in  the  exponential  phase  of
growth,  according  to  Eqs.  (1)  and  (2).

was  calculated  from  the  value  of  the  speci ﬁc  growth  rate
(td¼  lnð2Þ=m).

2.5.  Statistical  analysis
To  evaluate  differences  between  mean  values  of  the  apparent
speci ﬁc  growth  rate  (m),  the  microalgal  biomass  productivity  (PB),
doubling  time  (td)  and  nutrient  (pollutant)  removal  rates  (Ri),
Student ’s  T-tests  were  carried  out  with  a  conﬁdence  level  of  95%.
The  null  hypothesis  stated  that  the  means  were  equal.  A  value
p  /C20  0.05  indicate  that  there  is  a  signiﬁcant  difference  between
tested  means.
3.  Results  and  discussion
3.1.  Microalgal  growth  and  nutrients  removal  at  25/C14C
Only  the  results  from  the  cultures  at  25/C14C  are  presented  here
but  similar  trends  were  observed  for  the  cultures  developed  under
the  other  two  conditions  tested:  B15 –12,  B15 –18  (data  not  shown).
For  the  batch  experiment  at  25/C14C  and  a  photoperiod  of  12  h,  the
chlorophyll  concentration  proﬁle  followed  the  same  trend  as  those
of  VSS  and  TSS  (Fig.  1a).  Additional  results  showed  a  linear
correlation  (R2=  0.95,  data  not  shown)  between  the  chlorophyll
concentration  and  the  volatile  solids  (VSS)  under  our  experimental
conditions.  This  suggests  that  the  chlorophyll  concentration  could
be  used  as  an  indicator  of  microalgal  growth  or  at  least
photosynthetic  activity  under  our  conditions.
The  TSS/VSS  ratio  increased  (Fig.  1a)  over  the  last  80  h  of  the
experiment.  This  could  be  due  to  an  increase  in  the  TSS  brought
about  by  mineral  precipitation  as  the  pH  increased  towards  the  end
of  the  experiment.  We  propose  phosphate  as  the  likely  candidate
(see  Section  3.4).  The  control  experiments  in  which  the  pH  was
constant  at  around  8  exhibited  no  signiﬁcant  precipitation  or
increase  in  the  VSS/TSS  ratio.
The  dissolved  oxygen  concentration  had  a  tendency  to  increase
during  the  experiment  under  the  different  conditions  where  there
was  algal  growth,  indicating  a  prevalence  of  photosynthetic
activity  over  heterotrophic  carbon-oxidation  and  nitriﬁcation.
Nitriﬁcation  was  observed  when  the  cultures  were  grown  under
obscurity  (Figs.  1  b  and  4  c);  the  decrease  in  ammonium
concentration  was  accompanied  by  nitrite  formation  that  peaked
at  70  h  and  then  decreased,  presumably  due  to  further  nitrite
assimilation  by  the  microalgae.  Comparing  the  nitrite  concentration
proﬁle  for  the  illuminated  cultures  at  25/C14C  (Fig.1 b)  and  the  cultures
in  obscurity  (Fig.  4c),  one  can  expect  nitrite  uptake  by  microalgae  to
occur  after  ammonium  exhaustion  under  illuminated  conditions.
The  nitrate  concentration  remained  approximatelyconstant  and  low
(about  2  mgN  L/C01)  over  the  entire  experiment  (data  not  shown).  Its
consumption  due  to  denitri ﬁcation  was  unlikely  to  occur  under
aerobic  conditions  and  increasing  dissolved  oxygen  concentration  in
the  culture.  On  the  other  hand,  data  obtained  for  the  cultures  in
obscurity  (Fig.  4c)  suggest  no  nitriﬁcation  by  conversion  of  nitrite  to
nitrate  after  ammonium  exhaustion.Table  2

variety  of  nitrogen  sources  including  ammonium,  nitrate,  nitrite
and  urea  [9,12]  although  ammonium  is  the  preferred  nitrogen
source.  Ammonia  is  the  most  energetically  efﬁcient  nitrogen
source,  since  less  energy  is  required  for  its  uptake.  Ruiz-Marin  et  al.
[24]  reported  that  the  microalgae  C.  vulgaris  and  S.  obliquus  showed
preferences  for  ammonium  to  any  other  form  of  nitrogen  present
in  wastewater.  Under  both  autotrophic  and  heterotrophic  con-
ditions,  ammonium  is  transported  across  the  membrane  by  a  group
of  proteins  belonging  to  the  ammonium  transporter  family,  a  group
of  evolutionarily  related  proteins  commonly  found  in  bacteria,
yeasts,  algae  and  higher  plants  [25].  At  25/C14C  as  well  as  in  all  other
conditions  (except  at  5/C14C  where  no  biological  activity  occurred,  see
Section  3.2),  the  order  of  priority  for  the  consumption  of  nitrogen
sources  was  as  expected  ammonium  (NH 4+)  ﬁrst  and  then  (NO 2/C0).
Under  our  conditions  nitrate  did  not  seem  to  be  assimilated  by  the
microalgae  (similar  nitrate  proﬁles  were  measured  in  light  and
darkness  conditions,  data  not  shown).
The  pH  increased  during  the  experiments  from  7.8  to  10.0
(Fig.  2).  Several  factors  might  explain  the  pH  variation,  such  as
microalgal  growth  (pH  increase  as  a  result  of  CO2uptake  from  the
medium  by  autotrophic  and/or  mixotrophic  microalgae)  and/orexcretion  of  basic  metabolites  from  biodegradation  of  organic
matter  [5].
During  the  culture,  a  decrease  in  the  phosphate  concentration
over  time  was  also  detected  (Fig.  2,  discussed  later).
3.2.  Effect  of  temperature  and  photoperiod  on  microalgal  growth  and
biomass  productivity
The  total  chlorophyll  (a  +  b)  concentration  in  terms  of  absolute
values,  or  normalized  by  its  initial  concentration,  were  followed
through  the  batch  experiments  at  different  temperatures  and
photoperiods  (Figs.  2  and  3).
At  the  lowest  temperature  tested  (5/C14C),  no  net  microalgal
growth  (increase  in  chlorophyll  concentration)  was  observed
whatever  the  photoperiod  duration  (cf.  B5–6,  B5–12,  Fig.  3).  Roleda
et  al.  [26]  also  reported  low  to  negative  growth  rates  for  microalgal
cultures  at  low  temperatures  (10/C14C).  They  reported  that  micro-
algae  were  just  able  to  sustain  metabolic  activity,  without  cell
division;  in  some  cases  cell  death  was  observed  resulting  in  a
negative  growth  rate.  Reduced  microbial  activity  and  the  absence
of  microalgal  growth  were  expected  at  5/C14C.  Furthermore,  the
inoculum  for  our  experiments  had  come  from  a  culture  at  room

ture  cannot  be  ruled  out  as  a  possible  explanation  for  our  results.
The  apparent  speci ﬁc  growth  rate  (m)  at  15/C14C  was  determined
to  be  0.020  h/C01for  the  two  photoperiods  tested  (Table  2)
suggesting  that  the  photoperiod  did  not  affect  the  m  value  at  this
temperature.  At  25/C14C,  m  increased  slightly  to  0.025  h/C01(p  <  0.05).
The  duration  of  the  exponential  phase  also  depended  on  the
conditions:  126  h  for  B15 –12  (from  48  to  174  h);  79  h  for  B15 –18
(from  47  to  126  h)  and  79  h  for  B25 –12  (from  23  to  102  h).
Biomass  productivity  was  positively  affected  by  temperature
(Table  2).  The  highest  value  was  observed  at  the  highest
temperature  (25/C14C)  (p  <  0.05).  Similar  results  have  been  reported
by  Martinez  et  al.  [27]  where  the  optimal  temperature  seemed  to
be  25/C14C  for  algal  biomass  production  in  stirred  cultures  of  the
microalgae  Scenedesmus  obliquus  in  urban  wastewater.
The  ﬁnal  chlorophyll  concentration,  measured  at  the  end  of  the
experiment,  strongly  depended  on  the  temperature  (Fig.  2:  about1.5  mg/L  at  15/C14C  and  2.6  mg/L  at  25/C14C).  The  photoperiod  had  little
inﬂuence  on  this  parameter,  although,  higher  biomass  values  were
determined  for  the  culture  B15-18  compared  with  those  of
B15 –12  after  approximately  70  h  and  until  170  h.  This  could  be
attirbuted  to  the  lower  chlorophyll  concentration  at  time  zero  for
the  culture  B15 –12.
The  main  differences  between  the  experiments  at  the  two
photoperiods  are  the  shorter  exponential  growth  phase  and  the
presence  of  a  stationary  phase  for  B15 –18.  This  may  be  explained
by  the  pH  proﬁle  of  the  cultures  (Fig.  2)  over  time.  After
approximately  70  h,  a  signiﬁcantly  higher  pH  of  the  culture
B15 –18  is  observed  compared  with  B15 –12.  This  is  expected  to  be
linked  to  a  higher  CO2uptake  rate,  related  to  increased  microalgae
concentration  in  the  culture  B15 –18  (Fig.  2b).  Since  pH  has  a  strong
impact  in  microbial  growth  and  activity,  this  increase  might  have
contributed  to  the  halt  of  the  exponential  growth  phase  for  B15 –18
sooner  than  that  for  B15 –12.
In  the  experiment  B25 –12  (Fig.  1),  the  exponential  growth
phase  (until  approximately  100  h)  was  followed  by  a  phase  of
linear  growth.  A  possibility  is  that  this  linear  phase  resulted  from  a
light  and/or  nitrogen  limitation  [27];  at  100  h,  ammonium
depletion  in  the  medium  was  observed,  as  previously-stated  in
Section  3.1.
In  order  to  quantify  the  relative  signiﬁcance  of  non-photo-
trophic  microbial  metabolism,  experiments  were  also  performed
in  obscurity  (Fig.  4).  In  darkness  the  pH  of  the  cultures  remained
approximately  constant  over  time  at  8.5  for  all  the  temperatures
tested  (data  not  shown).  No  increase  in  the  chlorophyll  concen-
tration  (neither  in  the  TSS  or  VSS  concentrations,  data  not  shown)
was  observed,  suggesting  that  there  was  no  microbial  growth  and,
in  particular,  no  algal  biomass  production.  This  suggested  that  the
microalgae  in  our  cultures  were  obligate  phototrophs  unable  to
grow  or  perform  heterotrophic  metabolism  with  the  available
organic  carbon  in  the  medium.  This  may  be  also  due  to  the
presence  of  refractory  organic  carbon  that  are  not  biodegraded  by
heterotrophic  bacteria  or  microalgae.  Thus  photosynthesis  seems
to  be  the  predominant  biological  phenomenon  in  our  cultures.
3.3.  Nitrogen  removal
The  rate  of  NH 4+removal  in  all  batch  cultures  increased  at
higher  temperatures  and  longer  photoperiods  (p  <  0.05)  (Table  2).
NH 4+and  PO43/C0were  not  removed  in  batch  cultures  at  5/C14C
(B5 –6  and  B5–12).  This  is  in  agreement  with  the  absence  of0510152025

nor  nitriﬁcation  was  observed  in  these  conditions  (Fig.  4).
A  linear  correlation  between  chlorophyll  and  ammonium
concentration  in  the  culture  was  observed  for  the  experiments
at  15/C14C  and  25/C14C  (Fig.  5a).  The  pattern  suggests  that  the
consumption  of  this  compound  was  associated  with  microalgal
growth,  nevertheless,  ammonium  may  have  been  also  depleted  by
abiotic  phenomena  such  as  stripping  related  to  the  high  pH  levels
induced  by  the  photosynthetic  activity  (see  later)  and  respired  by
nitrifying  bacteria.
The  slopes  of  the  graphs  were  dependent  on  the  conditions
tested  (Fig.  5a).  The  maximal  slope  was  found  for  the  B25 –12  test
(25/C14C  and  12  h  photoperiod)  which  suggested  that  microalgae-
related  ammonium  depletion  is  temperature  dependent.  The  slope
of  ammonium  depletion  at  25/C14C  seems  to  be  additionally
inﬂuenced  by  bacterial  nitriﬁcation  as  demonstrated  by  our
experiments  performed  in  the  dark  (Fig.  4c).
At  15/C14C,  ammonium  depletion  was  expected  to  be  only  related
to  algal  activity  as  no  ammonium  depletion  occurred  in  the
darkness  at  this  temperature  (Fig.  4b).  Similarly,  a  very  low
nitriﬁcation  activity  has  been  detected  for  cultures  of  Nitrosomonas
and  Nitrobacter  at  15/C14C  [28].  Likewise,  larger  ammonium  removal
was  determined  for  the  culture  B15-18  compared  with  the  culture
B15-12  (Fig.  5  and  Table  2,  Eq.  (3)).  Certainly,  ammonium  was  ﬁrst
depleted  by  the  culture  developed  at  18  h/6  h  (approximately  at
143  h)  whereas  the  presence  of  NH 4+was  still  available  at  the  end
of  the  experiment  for  the  culture  B15 –12  (data  not  shown).  This
could  have  been  due  to  the  higher  biomass  concentration  produced
over  time  in  the  former  culture  as  previously  stated.
In  order  to  get  a  better  understanding  of  the  mechanisms  of
nitrogen  removal,  the  nitrogen  balance  at  time  zero  and  at  the  end
of  each  experiment  (the  molar  ratio  in%  between  each  nitrogen
species  and  the  total  nitrogen  at  times  t0and  tf)  was  examined
(Fig.  6).  The  incubation  time  for  the  experiment  was  192  h.  At  the
beginning  of  the  experiment,  nitrogen  was  mainly  in  the  form  of
ammonium  (72–81%)  and  at  the  end  of  the  experiments,  a  high
percentage  was  in  the  particulate  form  (54–63%).
In  our  experiments  the  difference  between  the  particulate
nitrogen  concentrations  (Np)  at  the  beginning  and  the  end  of  the
experiment  corresponded  to  the  nitrogen  assimilated  by  the
microorganisms  (algae  and  bacteria).  For  all  experiments,  the
nitrogen  assimilation  into  the  biomass  accounted  for  50  /C6  2%  of  the
total  nitrogen  at  the  beginning  of  the  assays.  Su  et  al.  [5]  reported
similar  results  on  nitrogen  assimilation  in  ﬁlamentous  blue-greenalgae;  the  nitrogen  assimilation  into  biomass  was  between
40.7  /C6  0.4%  and  52.9  /C6  0.3%  in  four  batches  with  a  photoperiod
of  12  h.  Similar  nitrogen  contents  were  measured  in  biomass
obtained  in  our  different  tested  conditions  (between  0.035  and
0.051  gN  g/C01DW),  suggesting  identical  nitrogen  assimilation
abilities.  These  low  nitrogen  content  values  may  be  due  to  the
low  nitrogen  concentration  in  the  medium.
In  the  presence  of  light  (Fig.  6),  83%  of  the  ammonium  was
removed  from  the  medium  at  15/C14C  and  12  h  photoperiod  and  100%
in  the  other  two  conditions.  This  suggests  that  both  temperature
and  photoperiod  have  an  impact  on  ammonium  depletion.  Similar
results  were  obtained  by  Martinez  et  al.  [27],  in  a  batch  culture  at
25/C14C  (tf=  188  h)  with  100%  removal  of  NH 4+.  Wang  et  al.  [9]
reported  83%  of  ammonium  removal  when  treating  raw  wastewa-
ter  with  Chlorella  sp.  These  authors  also  conﬁrmed  that  ammonium
or  NO xwere  used  as  nitrogen  source  by  the  microalgae.  In  semi-
continuous  cultures  with  immobilized  green  algae,  the  ammonium
depletion  depended  strongly  on  the  algal  species  tested  [24].  Aslan
and  Kapdan  [29]  showed  that  the  medium  composition  and  the
environmental  conditions  such  as  the  initial  nutrient  concentra-
tion,  the  light  intensity,  the  nitrogen/phosphorus  ratio,  the
photoperiod  duration  as  well  as  the  algae  species  highly  affected
nitrogen  and  phosphorus  removal.
At  the  end  of  the  experiments,  between  25  and  33%  of  the  total
nitrogen  could  not  be  accounted  for:  25%  at  15/C14C  and  12  h
photoperiod,  26%  at  15/C14C  and  18  h  photoperiod  and  33%  at  25/C14C
and  12  h  photoperiod.  As  previously  mentioned,  denitri ﬁcation
requires  anoxic  conditions  and  is  unlikely  to  have  occurred  in  the
stirred  open  bottles.  Thus,  stripping  must  be  the  major  phenome-
non  leading  to  nitrogen  loss.  Ammonia  volatilization  is  favoured  by
pH  values  higher  than  10,  as  observed  at  the  end  of  the  cultures
(Fig.  2).  These  pH  values  are  greater  than  the  pKa  of  the  NH 4+/NH 3
system,  which  ranges  from  9.24  (at  25/C14C)  to  9.90  (at  5/C14C).
However,  stripping  also  depends  on  the  gas-liquid  equilibrium  of
ammonia;  Henry ’s  coefﬁcients  increase  with  temperature,  from
5  /C210/C06at  5/C14C,  9.1  /C210/C06at  15/C14C  and  1.6  /C2  10/C05atm  m3mol/C01at
25/C14C,  favouring  greater  stripping  at  higher  temperatures.  The
more  extensive  N  loss  observed  at  the  higher  temperatures  could
be  explained  by  ammonium  stripping.
The  results  from  the  abiotic  experiments  (15/C14C  and  18  h
photoperiod)  conﬁrmed  that  under  unmodi ﬁed  pH  (pH  /C25  8),  the
ammonium  concentration  remained  constant  over  time  (192  h),
while  in  the  abiotic  assay  at  pH  10,  17  /C6  0.8%  of  ammonium  was
lost.  No  ammonium  stripping  was  measured  in  cultures  in  the

Fig.  6  for  25/C14C;  data  are  not  shown  for  5/C14C  and  15/C14C).  Under  these
conditions,  no  microalgal  growth  was  observed  and  consequently
the  pH  remained  constant  at  around  8.5  (data  not  shown).
Martinez  et  al.  [27]  also  reported  the  strong  inﬂuence  of  pH  on
ammonium  removal  by  ammonia  desorption  in  anoxic  batch
cultures  for  the  treatment  of  urban  wastewater  at  different
temperatures.  In  our  experiments  the  loss  of  nitrogen  was  mainly
attributed  to  this  stripping  phenomenon.  In  conclusion,  high
nitrogen  removals  portions  (72–83%),  linked  to  biomass  assimila-
tion  and  stripping,  are  observed  for  the  different  temperatures  and
photoperiods  tested.
3.4.  Phosphorus  removal
When  correlating  the  concentration  of  the  residual  phosphate
in  the  medium  with  the  chlorophyll  concentration  of  the  culture
(algal  biomass),  the  correlation  coefﬁcients  were  low  (Fig.  5b).  This
suggested  that  factors  other  than  assimilation  could  be  at  play.
Differences  in  the  depletion  rate  of  phosphate  (RPO4)  were
observed  for  different  temperatures  and  photoperiods  (Table  2).
However,  the  experiments  B15 –18  (15/C14C  and  18  h  photoperiod)  and
B25 –12  (25/C14C  and  12  h  photoperiod)  displayed  the  same  phospho-
rus  removal  rates  (0.024  mgP  L/C01h/C01).  This  could  have  been  due  to  a
trade-off  between  the  temperature  and  the  photoperiod  duration.
Moreover,  a  higher  phosphate  removal  rate  was  determined  for  the
cultureB15 –18comparedwiththeoneat12  hphotoperiod( Table2 ).
This  was  due  to  the  fact  that  in  the  former  culture,  phosphate  was
depleted  earlier  than  in  the  culture  B15 –12  (Eq.  (3)).  In  all  the
experiments  phosphatewas  totally  removed  from  the  medium  after
100 –150  h  (Fig.  2).  In  continuous  cultures,  phosphorus  removal
efﬁciencies  have  been  reported  to  be  between  70  and  95%  in
summer  conditions  and  25%  in  winter  conditions  [30].Su  et  al.  [5]  observed  phosphate  removal  efﬁcacies  ranging  from
56  to  73%  in  batch  cultures  (8  days  of  incubation)  with  a  low
nitrogen/phosphorus  ratio  (N/P  =  3:1).  This  low  level  of  phosphate
depletion  was  attributed  to  nitrogen  limitation  encountered  by  the
cultures.  Similar  results  were  shown  by  Aslan  and  Kapdan  [29]
using  cultures  of  C.  vulgaris  in  synthetic  wastewater  (10  days  of
treatment)  where  78%  of  phosphorus  was  removed  by  keeping
N/P  =  2:1.  In  contrast  Wang  et  al.  [9]  showed  that  up  to  90%  of
phosphorus  was  removed  from  wastewater  (9  days  of  incubation)
by  Chlorella  sp.  (N/P  =  6:1).  Previous  studies  have  shown  that  the
optimal  N/P  ratio  for  maximum  nitrogen  and  phosphorus  uptake
by  microalgae-bacteria  cultures  is  N/P  =  3:1  [5].  In  our  study  the
initial  N/P  ratio  was  17:1.  The  phosphate  removal  measured  in  our
work  did  not  seem  to  have  been  affected  by  the  N/P  ratio  in  the
medium,  indeed  this  high  ratio  should  have  favoured  phosphate
removal.  Phenomena  other  than  phosphorus  uptake  by  microalgae
could  be  responsible  for  phosphorus  removal.
The  variation  in  chlorophyll  and  phosphate  concentrations  over
time  were  tested  at  two  temperatures  and  photoperiods  tested
(Fig.  2).  During  the  ﬁrst  50  h  of  the  experiment  the  phosphate
concentration  fell  signiﬁcantly.  At  15/C14C,  the  algae  could  have
accumulated  phosphate  even  though  during  this  period  the  algal
biomass  remained  approximately  constant  (Fig.  2a  and  b).  The  fall
in  the  phosphate  concentration  may  be  due  to  adsorption  on  the
cell  surface,  which  has  been  previously  reported  to  contribute
signiﬁcantly  to  phosphorus  removal  from  wastewater  [27].  At  the
beginning  of  the  experiment,  the  magnitude  of  phosphorus
removal  was  not  affected  by  temperature  or  photoperiod.  This
observation  could  also  be  explained  by  adsorption.
Phosphate  removal  and  biomass  production  correlated  well
from  50  h  incubation  onwards  (Fig.  2).  From  approximately  100  h
(168  h  for  the  culture  B15 –12)  onwards  the  pH  of  the  cultures  rose
above  9.5.  At  this  elevated  pH,  the  chemical  precipitation  of0%20%40%60%80%Np

end  of  the  experiment  (ammonia  stripping).24  L.  Delgadillo-Mirquez  et  al.  /  Biotechnology  Reports  11  (2016)  18–26phosphorus  is  possible  and  in  every  graph  it  can  be  seen  that
complete  phosphate  removal  occurs  at  this  pH.  No  phosphate
removal  was  detected  for  cultures  in  darkness  where  pH  values
were  between  7.8  and  8.3  all  along  the  incubation  period.
It  can  be  seen  that  microalgal  growth  slowed  down  and  stopped
when  phosphate  was  no  longer  detected  in  the  medium  at  15/C14C
(Fig.  2a  and  b),  suggesting  that  the  exhaustion  of  this  nutrient  may
limit  growth.  For  the  cultures  at  25/C14C,  the  growth  did  not  stop  after
phosphate  exhaustion  (Fig.  2c).  This  may  be  explained  by  the  fact
that  microalgae  are  known  to  uncouple  nutrient  uptake  such  as
phosphorus  from  growth.  They  can  continue  to  grow  after  nutrient
exhaustion.  This  has  been  previously  demonstrated  and  modelled
[31–33].  Additionally,  the  phosphate  concentration  increased  in
the  medium  after  150  h.  This  could  have  been  as  a  result  of  cell
rupture,  releasing  the  intercellular  phosphate  content  into  the
medium,  a  phenomenon  that  has  been  reported  by  Martinez  et  al.
[27];  in  this  work  the  cell  rupture  was  conﬁrmed  by  microscopic
examination  showing  the  progressive  whitening  of  the  cells.
In  conclusion,  phosphate  seems  to  be  depleted  from  the
medium  through  different  mechanisms:  starting  with  adsorption
onto  the  cells  surface,  followed  by  assimilation  by  the  biomass  for  a
part  of  the  phosphate  ions  and  chemical  precipitation  for  the  other
part.  Phosphate  has  been  widely  reported  to  be  eliminated  through
biotic  processes  such  as  assimilation  [5,25]  into  biomass  (bacteria
and  microalgae)  and  abiotic  processes  such  as  adsorption  [27]  and
chemical  precipitation  [30].
4.  Conclusions
In  this  work,  the  effects  of  temperature  and  photoperiod  on
dissolved  nitrogen  and  phosphate  removal,  microalgal  growth  and
productivity  were  studied.  A  clear  understanding  of  the  abiotic  and
biotic  mechanisms  involved  is  required  in  order  to  improve  HRAP
performances  in  terms  of  biomass  productivity  and  wastewater
treatment.  An  increase  in  temperature  from  15  to  25/C14C  led  to  a
slightly  higher  apparent  speci ﬁc  growth  rate,  an  increase  in  the
microalgae  concentration  and  the  biomass  productivity.  Neither
growth,  nor  metabolic  activity  was  detected  for  cultures  at  5/C14C.
The  apparent  speci ﬁc  growth  rate  was  mainly  inﬂuenced  by
temperature  and  not  by  photoperiod  duration.
High  nitrogen  depletion  levels  (between  72  and  83%)  were
measured  in  our  study.  The  majority  (72–81%)  of  the  nitrogen  in
the  wastewater  was  found  in  the  form  of  ammonium.  The  highest
ammonium  removal  rate  was  determined  at  25/C14C.  The  biomass
nitrogen  content  obtained  under  different  conditions  (temperature
and  photoperiod)  was  similar,  suggesting  identical  nitrogen
assimilation  abilities.  Nitrogen  assimilation  by  the  biomass
contributed  to  nitrogen  removal  from  the  wastewater  (50  /C6  2%
of  the  total  nitrogen).  Ammonia  stripping  seems  one  of  the
mechanisms  responsible  of  nitrogen  elimination,  contributing  to  at
least  17%  of  N-removal.  Nitriﬁcation  was  also  a  pathway  for
ammonium  transformation  in  our  experimental  system.
All  phosphate  ions  were  removed  from  the  wastewater  after
approximately  100 –150  h.  The  highest  rate  of  phosphate  removal
was  measured  in  cultures  at  25/C14C  and  12  h  photoperiod  together
with  15/C14C  and  18  h  photoperiod.  The  phosphate  concentration
proﬁle  suggests  a  peculiar  trend:  a  theoretical  adsorption  of
phosphate  on  the  cell  surface,  followed  by  consumption  associated
with  microalgal  growth  and  ﬁnally  chemical  precipitation  due  to
the  high  pH  values.
Under  our  conditions  the  nitrogen  and  phosphate  depletion
rates  were  high  and  that  the  system  did  not  seem  to  require  organic
carbon  supply  for  this  process.  This  could  be  attractive  for  the
treatment  of  secondary  efﬂuents  where  there  is  little  organic
carbon  available.  Nevertheless,  further  work  must  be  carried  out  to
conﬁrm  these  preliminary  results.  Studies  should  assess  the  effectof  daily  and  seasonal  temperature  and  light  intensity  changes  on
nutrient  removal  and  microalgal  growth.  The  use  of  continuous
HRAP  and  ﬁnally  an  LCA  (Life  Cycle  Assessment)  and  cost  analysis
must  be  performed  to  fully  conﬁrm  this  system ’s  applicability  at
wastewater  treatment  with  an  indigenous  microalgae-bacteria
consortium.  Moreover,  mechanisms  of  adsorption  of  phosphate  on
the  cell  surface  and  its  assimilation  by  microalgae  should  be
further  studied.  In  order  to  improve  the  understanding  of  this
complex  microbial  system,  research  is  required  to  characterize  the
microbial  consortium  in  batch  systems.
As  a  conclusion,  microalgal  treatment  of  wastewater,  through
biological  and  physico-chemical  mechanisms,  could  represent  an
attractive  addition  to  existing  biological  treatments  used  to  purify
wastewaters.  The  advantages  of  using  microalgae  for  this  purpose
are:  an  in  situ  production  of  oxygen  by  microalgae  for  bacterial  use
and  the  possibility  of  recycling  assimilated  nitrogen  and  phospho-
rus  as  a  fertilizer.
