Abstract  
Nitrite  (NO 2-) accumulation and retaining of anammox bacteria are two decisive factors  for stable 
operation of partial denitrification and anammox coupling process.  Denitrifying ammonium 
oxidation (DEAMOX) process has been regarded as a promising way for nitrogen remova l from 
wastewater containing both ammonium  (NH 4+) and nitrate  (NO 3-) pollutants simultaneously . 
However, performance and efficiency of DEAMOX  process  in biofilm reactors are still not fully 
understood. This study successfully implements biodegradable Luffa Cylindrica  fiber as both 
carbon source and biofilm carrier in the DEAMOX system.  87% nitrate -to-nitrite transformation 
was achieved through the partial denitrification process.  An average total nitrogen (TN) removal 
efficiency of about 98% was obtained  with influent NH 4+-N and NO 3--N concentration of 100 mg 
L-1 in an up -flow packed bed biofilm reactor . The Field Emission -Scanning Electron Microscopy 
(FE-SEM ) photographs showed that  present conditions in the DEAMOX  packed bed reactor  favor 
the granulation of biofilm developed on L. cylindrica . The results imply that solid phase partial 2 
 denitrification and granulation of anammox bacteria was achieved using L. cylindrica  as a carbon 
source and biofilm carrier respectively. Complete NO 3- removal observed in this study support s 
the hypothesis that solid carbon source can support denitrification of NO 3- produced through the 
anammox process.

1. Introduction  
High concentrations of nitrogen ( N) compounds can deteriorate the aquatic environmental quality 
and threaten human health. Therefore, to protect water resources and public health from the 
detrimental effect s of N compounds , stringent nutrient level  for N compound s concentration of 
treated wastewater  have been set by many countries  [1].  Conventional NH 4+ removal process is 
accomplished by nitrification/denitrification , associated with high costs and give s rise to an 
adverse effect on the environment due to the high biomass production and greenhouse gas 
emission, contributing to  the global warming [2]. Although the biological process is economical 
for N removal, it is not highly effective for wastewater with low COD/N ratio due to the shortage 
of carbon source needed for denitrification [3]. One way to improve efficiency of N removal is 
adding external carbon source s, including methanol, ethanol, acetic acid and glucose , which is a 
costly process with the potential risk of insufficient or over dosing of carbon  source s [3]. 
Insufficient carbon source leads to NO 2- accumulation, while overdosing result s in remains of 
organic carbon in the effluent [3]. In recent years, innovative and cost -efficient autotrophic 
nitrogen removal systems including SHARON,  ANAMMOX, combined Partial 
SHARON/ANAMMOX process in two bioreactors, and combined Partial 
SHARON/ANAMMOX process in a single bioreactor (i.e. OLAND, CANON, and DEMON 3 
 process) have been put forward as promising alternative s for treatment of NH 4+ rich waste waters 
[4]. Interestingly, in all of these processes NO 2- plays a key role in promotion of biochemical 
reactions involved in NH 4+ removal. These innovations have rapidly finding fa vours  due to their 
higher efficiency and lower cost than the conventional N-removal methods [5]. The anammox 
process was found cost -effective N removal technology compared to traditional nitrification -
denitrification , given that anammox requires  less oxygen and the addition of organic carbon is not 
essential [6, 7]. Nonetheless, s low start -up and strict operational conditions are main  barriers for 
widespread use of autotrophic N removal systems  [5]. In addition, during anammox reaction, 11% 
of N is converted to NO 3-, resulting in a maximum efficiency of 87% for N removal  [8]. High  NO 3- 
concentrations  in effluent of anammox process have been reported  [9], indicating  that 
denitrification process is necessary to remove excess NO 3-, while external carbon source must be 
added for the denitrification . Although NO 2- accumulation is believed not to occur during 
denitrification as NO 2- reduction rate is higher than that of NO 3-, accumulation of NO 2- has been 
reported in denitrification  process  [10, 11 ]. NO 2- accumulation is attributed to microbial  
communities with two specific patterns  of denitrification pathway  including NO 3- reducing only 
to NO 2- and transient NO 2- accumulation during the reduction  of both NO 3- and NO 2- [1]. On the 
other hand, since oxidation of NH 4+ to NO 3- is more  probable than NH 4+ oxidation to NO 2- in 
aerobic wastewater treatment  [12], an innovative biological N removal process named 
DEnitrifying AMmonium O Xidation (DEAMOX) has been regarded as a promising way to 
nitrogen removal from wastewater containing both NH 4+ and NO 3- simultaneously  [13]. During 
the DEAMOX process, NO 3- is partially denitrified to NO 2- using organic carbon as an electron 
donor providing NO 2- for anammox bacteria  [14]. Therefore, NO 2- reduction to N 2 should be 4 
 suppressed  to achieve a desirable performance . Step-feeding organic carbon have been considered 
as a promising method for preventing NO 2- reduction to N 2 by denitrifiers [14].  
A number of studies [15-17] demonstrated the adverse effe cts of organic carbon on anammox 
systems . Complete inactivation or reduction of anammox activity  is mainly due to the fact that at 
high organic carbon concentration, denitrifiers out -compete the anammox bacteria,  resulting in 
abatement of anammox process [18]. Selective  carbon source , as an electron donor is an important 
factor influencing the end products of microbial NO 3- respiration so that particular carbon source 
may favor different respiratory pathways. Consequently, selective carbon source is a determining 
factor as to how it influence s the microbial community  [19]. Apart from liquid carbon sources, 
solid substrates have also been applied for denitrification process , i.e., solid -phase denitrification 
[20], offering a number of advantages including providing a constant carbon source and serving 
as solid matri ces for d evelopment of biofilm [20].  Generally, ther e are two main kinds of solid 
carbon source including the natural plant materials and synthetic biodegradable polymers [21]. 
Since the yield coefficient of heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria (Y=0.27 -0.3) [22] is much more 
than that of anammox bacteria (Y=0.066±0.01)  [22], co-existence of the two kinds of bacteria 
cannot be achieved easily. However, the availability of NO 2- has a pivotal  role in effective co-
existence of denitrifiers and anammox bacteria [13]. Due to long doubling time of 5.5 -7.5 days 
[16] and slow growth rate (maximum specific growth rate of 0.0027 h-1) [23] of the anammox 
bacteria , the biofilm reactors such as  fixed bed  and fluidized bed reactor have been used to ensure  
that enough biomass is available inside the reactors [24]. In comparison with conventionally  used 
sequencing batch reactors, biofilm and granular systems improve anammox  biomass retention  [25] 
and enhance anammox start -up performance  [26].  Moreover, biofilm reactors reduce the microbial 
washout, permitting the operation of the reactor at longer solid retention time  (SRT) and shorter 5 
 hydraulic retention time  (HRT ), resulting in higher treatment efficiency and lower effluent solids  
[27]. This paper investigates the DEAMOX process in an up-flow packed bed biofilm reactor  using 
L. cylindrica  as an organic  carbon source and biofilm carrier.  Methodology for NO 2- accumulation 
through the partial denitrification is successfully developed in order to facilitate  anammox process 
promoting DEAMOX system.  This study hypothesized that L. cylindrica  can provide a constant 
and low -release carbon source favored to accumulate NO 2- by denitrifie rs. The proposed method 
is shown to improve the coupling  of partial denitrifica tion and a nammox , enabling more stable 
DEAMOX process.

 2. Materials and Methods  
2.1. Experimental setup  
A lab -scale up-flow packed bed biofilm reactor (Fig. 1) with the working volume of 1.25 L and 
inner  diameter of 80 mm was designed  and operated continuously as DEAMOX system. The 
temperature of the bioreactor was controlled at 30°C using  a thermostat and flexible silicone 
heating element coiled around the reactor . L. cylindrica  was used as a biological carrier. In order 
to prevent penetration of light and maintain the constant temperature, the react or was insulated by 
glass wool and aluminum foil. The experiment was undertaken  for the duration of  205 days. The 
Redox and pH values were monitored continuously to ensure the stability of the biological 
processes in the reactor . The value of pH was maintained  at 7.8  using  0.1 M HCl and 0.1 M NaOH .  
The ORP  (Oxidation -Reduction Potential)  was fluctuated between -76 and -117 mV. The reac tor 
experiment was designed  in five Phases (see table 1 ). During Phase I, the DEAMOX process was 
carried out at a same concentration of NH 4+-N and NO 3--N = 100 mg L-1 with HRT  of 12 hr.  In 
Phase II, HRT was decreased by 40% because of the biofilm developed on the medium.  In Phase 
III, the HRT was adjusted again by decreasing the flow rate. During Phase IV, acetate as an 
external carbon source (COD/NO 3- ratio of 3.0) was added to the feeding tank. Finally, in Phase 
V, the reactor was operated the same as Phase I.  The percentage of anammox/denitrification 
contribution on TN removal was determined throughout the tests  using Eq. 1 and 2 [28]:  
Anammox percentage = [(Inf. NH 4+-N–Eff. NH 4+-N) +1.32 (Inf. NH 4+-N–Eff. NH 4+-N)] ×100% 
(Inf. TN –Eff. TN)                 (1) 
Denitrification percentage = 100% - anammox percentage ( %)                                                  (2)

2.2. Inoculation and biofilm formation   
The initial seed for the enrichment of denitrifiers was obtained from  an anoxic tank of municipal 
wastewater treatment plant  based in Tehran, Iran . Then, the enrichment of denitrifiers biomass was 
performed in a batch system using synthetic wastewater containing NO 3- and L. cylindrica  as a N 
and carbon source , respectively. Following  the enrichment of denitrifiers in the batch system, the 
biofilm developed on the medium were mechanically transferred to synthetic wastewater. Enriched 
biomass of anammox bacteria  obtained from our previous study  [29] was used as an inoculum . 1 
L glass bottle  congaing synthetic wastewater inoculated by  120 mL enriched anammox sludge and 
40 mL denitrifier  sludge were anaerobically introduced into the  up-flow packed bed biofilm reactor  
using a peristaltic pump . The reactor was operated in a circulation loop for 25 days  to immobilize 
the biofilm on the carrier .  
 8 
 2.3. Synthetic wastewater  
The ratio of NO 3--N/NH 4+-N in the influent was kept at 1. The composition of synthetic wastewater 
was as follows  (L-1): 607.17 mg/L NaNO 3 (100 mg NO 3--N), 0.397 g  NH 4Cl (100 mg/L NH 4+-N), 
0.014 g  KH 2PO4, 1.180 g KHCO 3, 0.110 g MgCl 2.6H 2O, 0.012 FeSO 4.7H 2O, 0.300 g CaCl 2.2H 2O, 
1 mL trace element solution  contained (L-1): 15 g Na -EDTA,  0.43 g ZnSO4·7H2O, 0.24 g 
CoCl 2·6H 2O, 0.81 g MnCl 2·2H 2O, 0.25 g CuSO 4·5H 2O, 0.22 g Na 2MoO4·2H 2O, 0.19 g 
NiCl 2·6H 2O, 0.11 g Na 2SeO 3·5H 2O, 0.01 g FeSO 4·7H2O, and 0.07 g H 3BO 3 [29].  
2.4. Biofilm carrier  
Biodegradable L. Cylindrica  fiber was used as both the carbon source and biofilm carrier. L. 
cylindrica  was obtained from Luffa farm in Iran. It was washed with di stilled water to remove 
impurity then dried in an oven at 80°C for 5 hr. Surface morphology of L. cylindrica  and biofilm 
immobilized on the support were characterized by means of FE-SEM.  The samples were prepared 
by fixation, dehydration, drying, mounting and coating  [30]. Prepared samples were investigated 
using FE-SEM method . 
2.5. Analytical methods  
The effluent samples were taken every fifth day and analyzed immediately after sampling . 
The samples were filtered  through 0.45 µm membrane prior to determine the concentration of N 
compounds. NO 2--N and NO 3--N were measured using spectrophotometry method accordin g to 
standard methods  (4500 -NO 2-B and 4500 NO 3- C respectively)  [31]. NH 4+-N was measured using 
volumetric method by titration after distillation of NH 4+ (4500 -NH 3 C) [31]. 
 9 
 2.6. Batch experiments  
In addition to continuous up-flow packed bed biofilm reactor , some batch tests were carried out  to 
determine the NO 3- to NO 2- transformation rate ( i.e., partial -denitrification activity). The batch test 
was conducted in a sealed 100 mL conical flask at 30°C. 1 g biofilm taken from up-flow packed 
bed biofilm reactor on day 75 was added to the flask containing 75 mL basal medium  [32] with 
NO 3--N concentration of 25 mg/L.  Moreover, one flask with NO 3- and lack of substrate was also 
run as a control test. The  supernatant samples were collected and analyzed for NO 3- and NO 2- 
concentration.  The N 2 was sparged into the flask for 2 m in to develop anoxic condition and 
resazurin  indicator was applied to monitor anoxic condition.  
The NO 3−-N to NO 2−-N transformation ratio (NTR) was determined  using Eq. 3 [33]: 
NTR (%) =  (𝑁𝑂2−−𝑁𝑡−𝑁𝑂2−−𝑁𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙 )(𝑁𝑂3−−𝑁𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙 ⁄ −𝑁𝑂3−−𝑁𝑡)×100  (3) 
3. Results and discussion  
3.1. Partial -denitrification activity  
The results obtained from batch experiments  (Fig. 2) show  87% nitrate -to-nitrite transformation 
was achieved by denitrifiers immobilized on L. cylindrica , demonstrating that that L. cylidrica  as 
a solid carbon source supported partial denitrification.  During solid phase partial denitrification, 
NO 3--N decrease d gradually using L. cyli ndrica as organic carbon source , whereas NO 2--N 
accumulated and reached the maximum value of 22 mg/L.  Different NTR rates have been reported 
in different condition. For example, NO 2--N accumulation of 71.7% under the acetate feast -famine 
condition has been observed [34]. While, with sludge fer mentation liquid as a carbon source, the 
NTR of 80% was achieved [35]. However, u se of other biopolymer s (i.e., Polycaprolactone  [PCL], 
Polylactic acid [PLA] and starch)  as a solid substrate for denitrification , did not show significant 10 
 nitrite  accumulation  [36, 37]. It has been reported that microbial community and consequently end 
product of NO 3- reduction can be altered by selective carbon sources  [19]. For example, D -
cellobiose induces Klebsilla  to be enriched as a NO 2- accumulator, while other carbon source 
enriched for an Escherichia  nitrate ammonifier  [19]. As the availabil ity of NO 2- is pivotal in the 
co-existence of denitrifiers and anammox bacteria [13], L. cylidrica  was applied efficiently for 
solid -phase partial denitrification process .

3.2. N removal in DEAMOX reactor  
Fig. 3 show s the variation of N compounds concentration and TN removal efficiency in the 
DEAMOX  system.  The figure indicates that NO 3- and NO 2- were  completely removed during 
Phase I , with  NH 4+ effluent concentration of less than 5 mg L-1. The average total nitrogen (TN) 
removal efficiency of about 98% was achieved during Phase I, demonstrating  co-existence of 
11 
 denitrification and anammox process es. Complete removal of NO 3- support s the hypothesis that 
solid carbon source can support denitrification of NO 3- produced through the anammox process.  
This result confirming the finding of  studies report ed the effect s of adding polycaprolactone 
(PCL) , as a solid carbon source , for the removal of the NO 3--N produced during anammox process  
[38].  
In Phase II, a reduction in TN removal efficiency was recorded. During phase 2. The TN removal 
efficiency was reduced  considerably by  about 30%  and reached the minimum level of 
approximately 60% by day 110 , indicating that HRT plays a key role on the efficiency of TN 
removal process.  HRT reduction  can be associated to biofilm  development  on the medium  leading 
to a reduced working volume  and subsequent ly HRT.   
The measurements show that the HRT was increased during Phase III by decreasing of inflow rate 
in order to operate the reactor under previous HRT  condition (12 hr).  Data presented in Figure 3 
for Phase III show that TN removal efficiency recovered after adjustment  of HRT .  
The effect s of excess organic matter on N removal efficiency  were  investigated by adding sodium 
acetate ( COD/NO 3- ratio of 3.0) during Phase IV.  During Phase IV, a significant 40% reduction in  
TN removal efficiency  was recorded,  revealing that denitrification was predominant process 
removing TN , while the average NH 4+ removal efficiency was only 19%. The analysis of the test 
data show that NO 2- was reduced to N2 rather than being accumula ted, resulting in inhibition of 
NH 4+ oxidation  by anammox bacteria . However, previous study found NO 2- accumulation rate can 
increase when COD/NO 3--N ratio was amplified [39]. Although acetate , as a carbon source , have  
high potential for NO 2- generation , partial denitrification will not be affected by COD/NO 3- -N 
ratio [40]. These variations in findings of previous studies can be associated with different 
characteristics of  microbial communities for NO 3- and NO 2- reduction.  Due to the different types 12 
 of metabolic pathways in various denitrifiers, different  pattern s of denitrification in wastewater 
treatment plants including partial denitrification, complete denitrification, and transient 
accumulation of NO 2- has been reported  [1]. Competition for electron donor between NO 2- 
reductase and NO 3- reductase  found to be different among denitrifiers, even when the same carbon 
source was used for denitrification [33]. Moreover, existence of two  carbon sources  can change 
the pattern of NO 2- accumulation  [39]. In Phase V, an increase in TN removal efficiency was 
observed (Fig. 3), as addition of acetate  to the feeding tank was stopped , and the reactor was 
operated the same as Phase I, indicating that the system was able to shift from denitrification to 
DEAMOX  process.

  Fig. 3. Variation of nitrogen compounds concentration and TN removal efficiency in the 
DEAMOX system  
Percentage s of anammox and denitrification contribution on TN removal in DEAMOX process  
was determined in this study ( Fig. 4). The results show  that the N was removed predominantly by 
ANAMMOX process which accounted for over 90% in all Phases , except for phase IV  (Fig. 4 ). 
During Phase IV, denitrification was the main pathway for N removal, demonstrating  that high 
concentration of organic carbon (acetate) promotes  complete denitrification instead of partial 
denitrification. Consequently, it was shown that relative lack of NO 2- accum ulation adversely 
affect ANAMMOX process due to the inhibit ion of NH 4+ oxidation.  This is consistent with a 
number of previous studies reporting adverse effect of organic carbon on ANAMMOX process, 
given that  high concentration of organic carbon suppress the ANAMMOX bacteria [13, 4 1].

3.3. FE-SEM analysis of L. cylindrica as a ca rbon source and biofilm carrier   
Natural L. cylindrica  fiber has unique properties such as  renewability, availability, low -cost, good 
hydrophilicity, biocompatibility, porous structure  non-toxicity to microorganisms, and long -term 
sustainability to the natural environment [42, 43,] making  this biopolymer efficient  as bio-carrier 
for wastewater treatment .  The average Brunauer -Emmett -Teller ( BET ) specific  surface area of L. 
cylindrica  fiber was determined to be 123 m2/g [44] which is higher than other biodegradable 
polymer  used for nitrogen removal . For example, BET surface area of 0.376 m2/g and 55 m2/g 
have been reported for polycaprolactone (PCL)  and poly -3-hydroxybutyric acid (PHB) 
respectively [3, 45]. Overall, the results show that high surface area of L. cylindrica  enhanced  
biofilm attachment, leading to  rapid  start-up performance . L. cylindrica  have a netting -like fibrous 
15 
 vascular structure serving like an open cell material  [46]. Cellulose  (62%) , hemicellulose  (20%),  
and lignin  (11%)  were  found to be the main components of L. cylindrica  fibers  [42]. Moreover, 
Luffa fiber  has solubility of 3.30% and 4.50% in hot water and cold water , respectively [47]. 
Initially, the biodegradable solid carbon source is hydrolyzed by  extracellular enzyme excreted 
from microorganisms immobilized on medium and then decomposed into solubl e and micro -
molecular substrates [48]. Unlike  liquid carbon source, L. cylindrica  provides constant and slow -
release carbon source favored to accumulate NO 2- by denitrifiers  indicating better condition for 
coupling of partial denitrification and anammox to achieve more stable DEAMOX process.  Fig. 5 
shows the FE-SEM of un -immobilized  (Fig. 5a and b) , immobilized (Fig. 5  c – f) and used (Fig. 5 
g and h) L. cylindrica . Fig. 5d shows a specific region of Fig. 5c with higher magnification.  The 
FE-SEM results show L. cylindrica  has rough surface with a various fibrous cord  and a large 
number of protrusions , making this matrix efficient as biofilm  medium  (Fig. 5a and b).  Figs. 5 c – 
f illustrate thick and compact granular biofilm developed on the carrier . FE-SEM results show  both 
netting -like fibrous structure and surface of fibrous threads were  completely covered by bacteria . 
This study also shown that bacteria were aggregated along  the threads and over the cords  (Figs. 
5c, e and f). Different models including inert nuclei model, synthetic and natural polymer -bonding 
model, spaghetti theory, and cell -to-cell communication model has been suggested  for anaerobic 
granulation [49]. According to inert nuclei model, presence of nuclei or micro -size biocarrier is 
the first step for attachment of bacteria [49]. Protrusions  disposed on the L. cylindrica  favor the 
granulation and spherical biofilm formation (Fig. 5d). Development of  granules with higher size 
and density due to polymer addition was reported [50]. Although, the biofilm is tightly integrated, 
some cracks observed  (Fig. 5d), which  can be attributed to microbial autolysis  [51]. Figs.  5g and 16 
 h show the used L. cylindrica  fiber . Microbial degradation of L. cylindrica  fiber  has resulted in 
concave cavities on the surface of L. cylindrica  (Figs . 5 g and h).

4. Conclusion  
Simultaneous partial denitrification and anammox process using L. Cylindrica  as a solid carbon 
source  and biofilm carrier  in an up-flow packed bed biofilm reactor  was successfully established . 
An average total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency of 98% was achieved  with influent NH 4+-N and 
NO 3--N concentration of 100 mg L-1 using the methodology outlined in this paper . L. cylindrica  as 
a slow -release carbon source supported co -existence of partial denitrification and anammox 
h 24 
 processes in the DEA MOX system and retention of anammox bacteria was successfully achieved 
due to biofilm granulation.  The results imply that solid phase partial  denitrification and granulation 
of anammox bacteria was achieved using L. cylindrica  as a carbon source and biofilm carrier , 
respectively. Complete removal of NO 3- supported the hypothesis that solid carbon source can 
support denitrification of NO 3- produced through the anammox process.
