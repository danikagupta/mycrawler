Abstract : Microbial fuel cell, as a new technology for energy generation, has gained a lot of attention in 
converting a wide range of organic and inorganic substrates to bioelectricity in recent years . Substrate as the fuel 
of MFC s has an effective role on the performance of MFCs . To investigate the effect of type and concentration 
of substrate on the MFC performance, glucose and date syrup were examined over a concentr ation range of 2-20 
g.l-1. Date syrup or any waste of date could be used as a natural substrate while glucose is considered as a 
synthetic carbon source.  In this research a two -rectangular chambered MFC separated  by a Nafion 112 proton 
exchange membrane , was constructed. The anodic compartment was inoculated by saccharomyces cerevisiae  as 
biocatalyst. 200 µmol.l-1 of neutral red as t he anodic mediator and 300 µmol.l-1 of potassium ferricyanide as 
oxidizer were added to anode and cathode chambers, respectively. The results has shown that 3 g.l-1 date syrup -
fed- MFC had the hig hest power density, 51.95 mW.m-2 (normalized to the geometric area of the anodic 
membrane, which was 9  cm2), corresponding to a current density of 109.0384 mA.m-2 and a MFC voltage of 
967 mV.  
 
Keywords:  Microbial fuel cell, Substrate, Glucose, Date syrup, Power density.  
1. Introduction  
The microbial fuel cells convert the chemical content in organic and inorganic compounds to 
electricity via catalytic activity of microorganisms as the bioc atalyst. Oxidation of substrate in 
anode ch amber by microorganisms results  in proton and electron production. Protons are  
transferred to cathode chamber through proton exchange  membrane [1-3] . Depending on the 
type of electron transfer mechanisms , MFCs are  categorized to two main groups, i.e. MFCs 
using mediator and mediator less MFC s [4]. 
Proton exchange system  [5], electrode type and distance [6] , temperature [7] , pH  [8], 
inoculums [9] and substrate  [10, 11] as the main effective parameters on MFCs performance 
were investigated by many researchers. The substrate, as a key parameter, influences the integral composition of the bacterial community in the anode biofilm, and the MFC performance including the power density (PD) and Coulombic efficiency (CE)  [12] .  MFCs 
have been solely considered as a bioelectricity generation method, until different wastewater s 
were utilized as the fuel in anode chamber  for the wastewater treatment  [13] . Wide varieties 
of substrate s ranging from pu re compounds to complex mixture  of organic m atters present in 
wastewater have been  used in MFC s as the carbon source  for bioelectricity generation as well 
as wastewater treatment purposes.  Acetate  [14] and glucose  [15] as the most common 
substrates, sucrose [16] , xylose  [17] and varios  types of wastewater like synthetic  [18] , 
domestic  [19] , brewery  [20] , swine  [21] and paper recycling wastewater [22] with different 
concentrations have been studied by many researchers. But it is difficult from literature to 
compare MFC s performances, due to different operating conditions such as surface area, type 
of electrodes and different microorganisms  used. The main purpose of  this article was to 
investigate the effect of two types of substrates , i.e. glucose and date syrup, as  well as their 
concentration on the MFC electrical performance in  a dual chambered fuel cell.
 Date is one of 
the main products of desert regions and its application as a substrate for MFCs in environmental biosensors in remote areas could be considered. A comparison was  made by 
1174the measurement of polarization curve under various concentrations for both types of 
substrates.  Different concentrations ranging from 2 - 20 g.l-1 were  chosen , while all other 
conditions kept constant. 
2. Methodology 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae PTCC 5269 was  supplied by Iranian Research Organization for 
Science and Technology, Tehran, I ran. The microorganisms were grown in an anaerobic jar. 
The general  medium for seed culture of both, Glucose -fed and date syrup- fed MFCs, 
consisted of yeast extract, NH 4Cl, NaH 2PO 4, MgSO 4 and MnSo 4: 3, 0.2, 0.6, 0.2 and 0.05 
g.l-1, respectively. Glucose an d date syrup as the carbon sources were added to this medium in 
a range 1 -20 g.l-1. Due to high concentration of date syrup,  date syrup was pretreated with 
different methods to break all its complex mixture to glucose. It was diluted, hydrolyzed with 
hydro chloric acid and then autoclaved for several times til l getting constant sugar content. 
These processes convert all its sugar content to glucose. The medium then was sterilized, 
autoclaved at 121°C and 15psig for 20 min.  
The medium pH was initially a djust ed to 6.5 and the inoculum was  introduced into the media 
at ambient temperature. The inoculated cultures were incubated at 30°C. The bacteria were 
fully grown for the duration of 24 hours in 100 ml flux without any agitation. Substrate consumption was calculated based on determination of the remained sugars in the culture. All chemicals and reagents used for the experiments were analytical grades and supplied by Merck (Germany). The pH meter, HANA 211(Romania) model glass -electrode was employed 
for the pH measurements of samples in the aqueous phase. The initial pH of the working solutions was adjusted by addition of dilute HNO
3 or 0.1M NaOH solutions.  DNS reagent 
was developed to detect and measure substrate consumption using colorimetric method [23] and cell growth was also monitored by optical density using spectrophotometer (Unico, USA).  
 The fabricated cells in the laboratory scale were made of Plexiglas material. The volume of each chamber (anode and cathode chambers) was 800 ml with working volume of 600 ml (75% of total volume). The sample port was provided for the anode chamber, wire point inputs and inlet port. The selected electrodes in MFC were graphite felt in size of 50 35 2 
mm. Proton ex change membrane (PEM; NAFION 112 , Sigma –Aldrich) was used to separate 
two compartments. The Nafion area separated the chambers was 3.79 cm
2. Nafion as a proton 
exchange membrane was subjected to a course pretreatment to take off any impurities that was boiling the film for 1h in 3% H
2O2, washed with deionized water, 0.5 M H 2SO 4, and 
then washed with deionized water. The anode and cathode compartments were filled by deionized water when the biological fuel cell was not in use to maintain membrane for good conductivity. Natural Red and Ferricyanide were supplied by Merck (Germany). These 
chemicals in optimum concentrations (200 µmol.l
-1 & 300 µmol.l-1) were used as mediators in 
anode and cathode of MFC, respectively.   
 S.cerevisiae used as a biocatalyst in microbial fuel cell for production of bioelectricity from 
carbohydrate source. This microorganism was grown under anaerobic condition in biofuel 
cell. Fixed incubation time and enriched media was used. The obtained data has shown that 
S.cerevisiae had good ability for consumption of substrate at anaerobic condition    The schematic diagram and illustration of the fabricated experimental set up with auxiliary 
equipments are shown in Fig. 1.

3. Results  and discussion  
As the MFC  were inoculated with S.cerevisiae, the voltage was continuously monitored by  a 
data acquisition system  to reach  the constant open circuit voltage  (OCV) . It took 42, 57, 67, 
65, 58, 48 and 30 hours for glucose with concentration of 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 20 and 30 g.l-1 to 
reach constant voltage of  922, 957, 970, 955, 920, 800mV r espectively,  These results were 64, 
67, 72, 68, 64, 52 and 40 hours for the same concentrations of date syrup  with the constant 
OCV of 988, 985, 948, 922, 916, 656 mV respectively . The results  indicated that  an increase 
in the substrate concentration increased the time needed to reach constant OCV at low 
concentration of 1- 5 g.l-1 for glucose and  1-3 g.l-1 for date syrup. 
Polarization  curves were recorded by  the data acquisition system  after the mentioned time 
duration when the constant OCV  was achieved . Fig. 2 shows  polarization curves of the MFC 
at the glucose concentration range of 1 -20 g.l-1. As the glucose concentration increased from 1  
to 5g.l-1, power and curre nt density gradually increased. However when the glucose 
concentration increased from 7 to 20g.l-1, it was observed that the power and current density 
were considerably decreased. That was because the most of glucose remained un consumed at 
high concentrati ons. The increase in time duration to reach constant OCV at low 
concentrations of  1-5 g.l-1 for glucose and 1- 3 g.l-1 for date syrup , and subsequent ly the 
decrease at higher concentrations, 7- 20 g.l-1 for glucose and 5- 20 g.l-1 for date syrup , can be 
also attributed to the substrate inhibition effect. Indeed, a ll carbon source s available in the 
substrate solution at low concentration s were consumed resulted in longer  time for attaining 
constant OCV . However  as the substrate concentration increased, the cons tant OCV was 
achieved  earlier with lower outputs , due to limitation in consuming carbon content in the 
substrate at higher concentration by microorganisms .

4. Conclusions 
In this study the effect of substrate type and concentration  on the performance of microbial 
fuel cell s was investigated . The glucose and date syrup were utilized as the carbon source for 
the production of electrical energy by means of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as the bioca talyst . 
Several concentrations of glucose  and date syrup  at the range of 1-20 g.l-1 were experimented 
in a two -chambered  fabricated MFC.  The results revealed that the optimum concentration 
with the highest electrical performance were 3 g.l-1 for date syrup and 5 g.l-1 for glucose. 
Comparing the two types of substrates used in this study, date syrup has shown a superior 
electrical performance.  The best results was achieved  using the date syrup at optimum 
concentration of 3 g.l-1 with the maximum power 53.7031 mW.m-2 and current density 110.86 
mA.m-2. The results also indicated that the substrate inhibition effect may have a significant 
role in the performance of MFC at high concentration of glucose and date syrup.
