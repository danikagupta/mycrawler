1. INTRODUCTION  
 
This paper discusses the attributes of water quality as 
determined by the five following characteristics of  
Ammonia Ni trogen (NH3 -N), pH, Total Suspended Solids 
(TSS) and Carbonaceous  Biochemical Oxygen Demand 
(CBOD) or Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and 
Tempe rature  as applied to 2014 actual data from a water 
treatment plant in the United States that asked to be not 
identified . A survey of the application of s tatistical 
techniques for discrete data are applied and a selection of the 
visualization plots generate d using Minitab 17 are presented 
in each of the following sections for each of the 5 selected 
variable s of water quality as indicated above.

3. ANALYSIS OF WATER QUAL ITY VARIABLES  
 
3.1 Carbonaceous Biochemical Oxygen Demand 
(CBOD)  
Carbonaceous Biochemical Oxygen Demand (CBOD) is the 
rate at which organisms use the oxygen in water or 
wastewater to while stabilizing decomposable organic 
matter under aerobic conditions. In decomposition, organic 
matter services as food for the bacteria  and energy results 
from its oxidation. Figure 1 is a Time Series plot that 
contains data set for the entire year of 2014 which is divided 
quarterly. The CBOD values are ranging between 2.0 and 
less than 6.0. The CBOD values are ranging between 3.0 and 
less than 15 which is acceptable for the CBOD effluent. This 
ISSN: 1690-4524 SYSTEMICS, CYBERNETICS AND INFORMATICS        VOLUME 14 - NUMBER 6 - YEAR 2016 47Time series plot shows a sequence of data points from the 
month of January till December for 2014 year. The CBOD 
value should be less than 15 mg/l (ppm).  
 
 
Figure 1 : Quarterly Time Series of CBOD  
 
Figure 2 is a histogram that shows most of the data points 
fall into the range of 2.0 to 3.0 which means basically the 
quality process of 2014 was operated well.   
 
Figure 3 is probability plot for the data for months of 
January, April, May, July, September,  October, and 
November that appear slightly departing from the straight 
line. Generally, the points on this plot form a nearly linear 
pattern which indicates that the normal distribution is a good 
model for this data set of 2014.

Figure 4 : X-Bar Charts of CBOD  
 
Figure 4 above is an X -Bar chart that shows that The CBOD 
values are ranging within the upper control limit of 4.35 and 
the lower control limit of 0.79. Figure  5 shows residual plots 
of CBOD and indicate that when temperature is between 14 
and 24 and flow is below 9, the data is stable under 2.5.

3.2 Total Suspended Solids (TSS)  
Total Suspended Solids Include a wide va riety of material, 
such as silt, decaying plant and animal matter, and industrial 
wastes, can be organic or inorganic, can be dissolved and 
suspended, and high concentrations of suspended solids can 
cause many problems for stream health and aquatic life.

48 SYSTEMICS, CYBERNETICS AND INFORMATICS        VOLUME 14 - NUMBER 6 - YEAR 2016 ISSN: 1690-4524Figure 6  is a histogram and shows that the last quarter 
recorded the highest frequency among all the quarters which 
was around 20. While the third quarter showed almost zero 
frequency at the end of the period. The f irst quarter 
represents a bi -model and while the second and final quarters 
represents a single spike model. The third quarter shows us 
a spike with maximum frequency close to another spike. And 
also the TSS data is centered on a peak of 4.8 mg/l, 6mg/l, 
4mg/l, and 4mg/l in the first, second, third and final quarters 
respectively. Which is well below the 20 mg/l monthly 
average TSS limit. This could indicate that TSS is not as 
susceptible to seasonal fluctuations.  
 
 
Figure 7 : Run Chart of Suspended Solids (TSS)  
 
Figure 7  is a runs chart that displays process performance of 
the TSS over time. Upward and downward trends, cycles, 
and large aberrations may be spotted and investigated. In a 
run chart, events, shown on the y axis, are graphed against a 
time perio d on the x axis. In the above figure, an average line 
(dark dotted line), representing the average of all the y values 
were recorded, which can easily be added to a run chart to 
clarify movement of the data away from the average. An 
average line runs paral lel to the x axis. The light colored dots 
are all the sample values taken quarterly for the entire year. 
And some outliers can be easily seen in the second and final 
quarters.  
 
3.3 Temperature  
Figure 8  shows time series plots of the variable Temperature.  
This show an increase in the temperature values from the 
middle of the second quarter and the recordings were high. 
These high recordings continued for next 6months after the 
second quarter. It is only in the middle of last quarter that the 
readings started  to come down. The highest reading recorded 
was in the third quarter which is 28 , and the lowest was in 
the first week of first quarter which is 8.   
Figure 8 : Time Series of Temperature Quarterly  
 
Figure 9  shows the variable of temperat ure versus the 
variable of CBOD and attempts  to determine if there is a 
correlation between ambient temperatures and the values of 
the CBOD leaving the plant. Although there were few points 
to look at, there does appear to be a correlation. When the 
temper atures are colder, the CBOD is increased. This 
corresponds with the high readings in the year. Likewise, 
when the temperatures are warmer, the CBOD levels are 
lower. This should indicate to personnel of water treatment 
plant  that CBOD should be more closel y monitored in winter 
months. They may explore taking more readings during 
those winter months in order to have more values to bring 
their monthly averages below the regulatory limit or explore 
solutions to taking additional measures to lower the CBOD 
during these months.

3.4 Ammonia Nitrogen (NH3 -N) 
The ammonia nitrogen at east plant is analyzed three times 
per week and is sampled as a 6 -hour composite that is flow 
weighted. The monthly average limit for nitrogen in water is 
4mg/l(ppm). Ammonia nitrogen (N) is present in variable 
concentrations in many surface and ground water supplies. 
A product of microbiological activity, ammonia when found 
in natural water is regarded as indicative of sanitary 
pollutio n. 
 
The moving average control chart for effluent ammonia  
(mg/l) is shown in Figure 10.   This moving average analysis 
represents the quarterly averages for the year period. Similar 
to the X -bar R chart, the upper control limit generated 
through the moving a verage analysis and how this limit 
compares to the permitted effluent limit is of primary

limit, however, these results are well below the permitted 
monthly average limit for ammonia of 4 mg/l.  Wi th these 
factors in mind, it cannot be said that the process is out of 
control based on the moving average results.   
 
However, the moving average results do indicate an upward 
shift in the process that warrants further evaluation of the 
operational process es and plant loadings. Ammonia is 
rapidly oxidized by certain bacteria, in natural water 
systems, to nitrite and nitrate --a process that requires the 
presence of dissolved oxygen. Ammonia, being a source of 
nitrogen is also a nutrient for algae and other f orms of plant 
life and thus contribute to overloading of natural systems and 
cause pollution.  
 
 
Figure 10 : Moving Averages of Ammonia  
 
Xbar -R chart as shown in Figure 11 plots the sample mean 
and sample range along with the control limits, if the sample 
mean is taken into consideration there are six points which 
are above the upper control limit and in sample range chart 
there are seven points which are above the upper control 
limit the process is out of control at those samples .

3.5 pH Variable  
The pH of natural waters is between 6.5 and 8.5. A 
measurement that is below 6 (acidic) or above 8.5 (alkaline) 
can disrupt aquatic life. Unlike the other variables analyzed 
pH has a maximum and minimum limit.  A Tim e series plot 
shown in Figure 12  is a sequence of data points which is 
shown quarterly for 2014 year. The pH valu e for water 
(H2O) is 7.0. If the waste water plant  manages to drag the 
pH value of waste water somewhere close to 7.0 then they 
have done a good job. As this plot suggests that the pH 
values for the month of May, July, October and December 2014 is very close to 7.0. These values were measured at 
successive times spaced at uniform time intervals every 
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursdays.  
 
 
Figure 12 : Time Series of pH  
 
The plotted graph of Figure 12  shows the Time Series Plot 
that is depicts the data quarterly  for the year 2014. In 
January -March and October – December, there are irregular 
variations on the value of pH when compared to the months 
of April -June and July -September.  
 
Figure 13  shows a moving average chart for pH values that 
helps analysts track the pH value movements of water for the 
waste water treatment plant . It shows average daily 
settlement readings for 2014 year, and shows a few out -of-
control values for samples at approximately  5, 20 and 150 to 
153.

4. CONCLUSIONS  
 
This paper has presented some applications of statistical 
quality control (SQC) as presented in text Montgomery 
(2013) to actual 2014 data as provided by a utility company 
that asked to remain anonymous in name  to determine if in 
compliance to the State’s Department  of Environmental 
Quality standards. The statistical analysis using Minitab 17 
provided evidence of where the discrepancies were located 
and problem areas that needed to be addressed for 
subsequent years. This research also provided insight into 
which SQC tools were most usefu l in determining the visual 
discrepancies  using Minitab 17 . The future directions of the
