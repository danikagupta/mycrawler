RESEARCH INTERESTS Photosynthetic microalgae are fascinating organisms that thrive in both freshwater and oceanic waters but also on the soil. They use the energy from sunlight to generate the chemical energy needed to fix CO2 releasing at the same time O2. In their everyday life microalgae are exposed to a wide range of abiotic stresses: from anthropogenic xenobiotics to nutrient or oxygen limitation or exposure to high intensity light. In all cases the cells need to maintain their homeostasis and for that complicated cellular mechanisms have evolved that provide protection and stress tolerance. Throughout my research, I have been interested in identifying the molecular mechanisms that photosynthetic microalgae employ to respond to different types of abiotic stresses. Presently I have been focusing on better understanding the complex interconnection of photoreception, photosynthesis and metabolism within Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.
