LETTER TO THE EDITOR
COMMENTS ON “ISOTHERMIC AND KINETI C MODELING OF FLUORIDE REMOVAL 
FROM WATER BY MEANS OF THE NATURAL BIOSORBENTS 
SORGHUM AND CANOLA”
Dear Editor,
Recently, Zazouli et al.1 published a paper entitled “Isothermic and kinetic
modeling of fluoride removal from water by means of the natural biosorbentssorghum and canola.” In the 
MATERIAL AND METHODS  section of their paper, the
authors mentioned that the pseudo-second-order rate equation has been given bythe following equation: 
where k
2 is the second order rate constant (g mg -1 min-1), and q and qe are the
amount of F adsorbed on the adsorbent (mg/ g) at equilibrium and at time t, and
gave a self-citation of secondary material2 as a reference. 
However, the equation in the cited paper is  incorrect. In addition, a citation error
was present in the reference to Zazouli et al.2 as the correct page numbers are 195-
204 rather than 208-17. 
In fact, the pseudo-second-order kinetic expression for the adsorption systems of
divalent metal ions using sphagnum moss peat was presented by Ho in 1995.3 The
pseudo-second-order kinetic model has a non-linear form:4 
 and the following four linear forms:4                                                            t                 1                    1

 The model has also been widely used for describing a number of adsorption
systems in subsequent years.5 Furthermore, an article entitled “Pseudo-second
order model for sorption processes” by Ho and McKay6 has been ranked number
one in annual citations in the Web of Science category of “Chemical Engineering”since 2008.
7 A review of second-order models for adsorption systems gave more
details.8
Furthermore, the mistake in the model made by Zazouli et al. in  their 2014 paper
in Journal of Mazandaran University Medical Sciences2 was also repeated that
year in another paper in Fluoride .9 
It is worth stating again that “Citing th e original paper not only respects the work
of the authors who presented a novel res earch idea but also discussed this idea in
detail in the body of their paper.”10 In addition, typical isotherms such as BET,11
Langmuir,12 and Freundlich13 have all witnessed increased trends in citations,
especially in the last two decades.14,15 In my view, Zazouli  et al. should have cited
the original paper for the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, which would haveprovided greater accuracy and additional information about the kinetic expression
they used.

Dr Balarak indicated that the correct form of the pseudo-second-order rate
equation was used in the calculations in his two papers.
I apologize for the errors.
