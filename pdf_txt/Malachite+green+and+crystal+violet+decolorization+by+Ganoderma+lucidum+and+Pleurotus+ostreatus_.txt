Abstract 
The triphenylmethane Malachite Green (MG) and Crystal Violet (CV) dyes are 
cationic dyes and mix with domestic wastewater when dumped; increasing, among others, the chemical and biological oxygen demand and can cause acute toxicity at different trophic levels. Promoting the removal (decolorization) of MG and CV , and laccase activity (54.8 ± 8.9 and 30.6 ± 2.9 UL 
-1  respectively) by using 
P. ostreatus  viable biomass needed parameters such as pH (4.5 and 6.0), temperature 
(25 to 30 °C), stirring speed (120 rpm), percentage of inoculum (2% v/v), and dye concentration (20 and 10 mg L 
-1 ). In adsorption studies, it was showed that an acidic 
pH favors the adsorption of both dyes and the model of pseudo-second order describes best the phenomenon of adsorption. Finally, the germination index (GI), using Lactuca sativa  seeds for the initial dyes solutions, was < 50%; demonstrating 
its high phytotoxic effect. When dye solutions were treated with viable biomass, the GI increased, leaving open the possibility to perform future research to determine if the aqueous solutions, post-treated with P. ostreatus , could be used in treatments 
that generate less toxic water which could be used in processes that do not require potable water.

Introduction 
A Triphenylmethane dyes, such as Malachite Green (MG) and Crystal Violet (CV), 
are synthetic cationic dyes frequently used in various industries: textiles, tanneries, Àsh farming, cosmetics, and plastic arts. Additionally, these dyes are widely used for Gram stains and colorations for spores, etc. in many educational institutions, research centers, and hospitals. Although small volumes are used in these activities (i.e. 1-2 mL per biological sample), the annual amount can be considerably increased (up to 6 ± 1 liters per semester at a university that has teaching and also research activities). During laboratory practices, laboratory wastewater-containing dyes are stored in plastic containers for Ànal disposal, allowing small amounts to seep into drains and mix with domestic wastewaters. Although in this step the dyes undergo a process of dilution, Partial removal and detoxi/f_ication of Malachite Green and 
Crystal Violet from laboratory arti/f_icially contaminated 
water by Pleurotus ostreatus original article Bogotá 260 Removal and detoxiÀcation of  Malachite Green and Crystal Violet 
Universitas Scientiarum Vol. 21 (3): 259-285 http://ciencias.javeriana.edu.co/investigacion/universitas-scientiarum the environmental impact is not eliminated due to the fact that triphenylmethane dyes 
increase the chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), 
solids content, water color, and can cause acute toxicity at different trophic levels 
(Przystaś  et al., 2012). 
The environmental problem is increased because these dyes have a chromophore 
group, consisting of a central carbon (methine group) bonded to three terminal aryl 
groups, which may be substituted by amino or hydroxyl functional groups in the para  position of the aromatic ring ( Thetford  2006). Additionally, these dyes have a 
solubilizing group; CV with C 
l-  ion and MG an oxalate ion (C 2O4-2 ). These chemical 
characteristics determine that triphenylmethane dyes are more resistant to biological degradation than other families of dyes and explains how biodegradation byproducts 
of these dyes can form intermediaries with more toxicity than the initial compound. 
For example, the MG and CV interact with the negatively charged cell membrane and accumulate over long periods of time causing skin irritation, liver damage, kidney 
failure, and have been linked to tumor formation in Àshes ( Oplatowska  et al., 2011, 
Parshetti  et al., 2011). 
For the biological removal of triphenylmethane dyes, there have been several 
successful studies using aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. However, these conventional 
processes can have some limitations (low removal efÀciency by adsorption, saturation of biomass, pH, and temperature sensitivity, etc.). Hence why, other microorganisms that can be more efÀcient and tolerate to the changes that occur in the physical- chemical conditions of wastewater contaminated with dyes. In this sense, wood rotting fungi, such as P. ostreatus , have received great attention. These fungi degrade 
phenolic compounds with structural similarity to lignin (dyes). Such degradation is the result of the combination of enzymatic and non-enzymatic systems. The ligninolytic enzymes (i.e. laccase (EC 1.10.3.2), manganese peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.13), lignin peroxidase (EC 1.11.10.14), and the versatile peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.16)) participate in the degradation. Other hydrogen-producing enzymes are also involved like aryl alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.90) and the glyoxal oxidase (EC 1.2.3.5). These enzymatic mechanisms generate peroxide, mediated by cellobiose dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.99.18) and the quinones redox cycle. This peroxide reacts with iron salts at acidic pH; conducting a biological Fenton process that generates highly reactive hydroxyl radicals on the triphenylmethane compounds ( Dashtban  et al., 2010). 
Among the most studied enzymes, it is possible to found laccases, also called 
benzendiol: Oxygen oxidoreductases. These proteins may be dimeric or tetrameric glycoproteins and contain four copper atoms in its active site (Cu 
+2 ). They can catalyze 
the oxidation of ortho  and para  diphenols, aminophenols, polyphenols, polyamines, 
lignin, dyes, and aryl diamines. This process starts upon binding oxygen or aromatic compounds to the active site, which occurs four times, and ends when the enzyme returning to a relaxed state. Additionally, water is one of the catalytic reaction’s product, so it has been called a green catalyst ( Rivera-Hoyos  et al., 2013, Sáenz-Suárez 
et al., 2014, Rivera-Hoyos  et al., 2015). 
On the other hand, mycelia morphology of Pleurotus ostreatus  (thin hyaline hyphae, 
long and pellets) and spore production are additional functional aspects that favor the removal of triphenylmethane dyes. The fungal wall, composed by chitin, acts Funding:

hyphae to form a compact mycelial network; acting at the same time as new active 
sites for adsorption. As a result, the fungus generates a sequential mechanism (bio 
adsorption/biotransformation) which potentiates the removal of the dyes in a short periods of time, supports pH changes and the presence of heavy metals, and can 
be reused in several operation cycles generating less sludge ( Puentes-Cárdenas  et al., 
2012b, Castillo-Carvajal  et al., 2013). 
Thusly, the removal of CV and MG dyes was evaluated in this study; using viable 
biomass (VB) and nonviable biomass (NVB) of P. ostreatus  to determine its relationship 
with the laccase activity and adsorption mechanisms. Additionally, the effect of the 
dyes before and after treatment with the fungal biomass by means of GI of Lactuca 
sativa  seeds was assessed using " in vitro " assays in humid chamber and submerged 
camera. 
Materials and methods 
Microorganism and culture media 
P. ostreatus  was supplied by the Laboratory of Environmental and Soils Microbiology, 
from the PontiÀcia Universidad Javeriana. Strain reactivation was performed on Wheat Bran Extract agar (WBEA) for seven days at 30 °C. Production of pelletized 
biomass was performed by inoculating Àve discs of Wheat Bran Extract Agar with 
fungal biomass in 100 mL Erlenmeyer Áasks with 50 mL of broth Wheat Bran Extract (BWBE). The cultures were incubated at 30 °C at 120 rpm during seven days. 
Experimental design 
With the objective to deÀne the best conditions to perform the removal experiments, 
two Plackett-Burman Experimental Designs (PBED) were conducted to evaluate the effect of the Àve factors at two levels each on the decolorization percentage of MG, CV , and laccase activity ( Table 1 ). Each experiment was carried out in triplicates using 
100 mL Erlenmeyer Áasks with 50 mL of minimum mineral medium supplemented accordingly with each treatment. The operating conditions were set up according to the PBED matrix; generating 36 runs (12 treatments). Wet biomass from P. ostreatus  was 
used as the inoculum and expressed as weight percentage. At the end of the evaluation time (72 h for MG and 216 h for CV), supernatants were recovered by centrifugation at 8000 rpm during 10 minutes and the initial and Ànal concentration were determined in mg L 
-1  for the two dyes at λ = 615 nm and λ = 590 nm for MG and CV respectively. 
Decolorization percentages were calculated by following the methodology reported by Morales  et al., 2016. Laccase activity was determined following the protocol reported 
by Tinoco  et al., 2001. Manganese peroxidase (MnP) activity was determined following 
the protocol reported by Quevedo-Hidalgo  et al., 2015. 
Removal experiments 
According to PBED results obtained for both dyes, 100 mL Erlenmeyer Áasks were 
used with 50 mL of sterile Radha medium ( Radha  et al., 2005). Each dye was added 
(20 mg L -1  MG, pH 4.5 and 10 mg L -1  CV , pH 6.0) along with 2 % (w/v) of viable 262 Removal and detoxiÀcation of  Malachite Green and Crystal Violet 
Universitas Scientiarum Vol. 21 (3): 259-285 http://ciencias.javeriana.edu.co/investigacion/universitas-scientiarum and non-viable fungal biomass (VB and NVB). Inactivation of biomass after the 
autoclaving process (for 15 minutes at 1 atmosphere pressure, 121 °C) was veriÀed by culturing the mycelium in WBEA and incubating at 30 °C for seven days. At the end of the period of incubation, no growth was observed. Both assays were performed at 120 rpm, and the evaluation time was 72 and 216 h for MG and CV respectively (this time was selected in function to the decoloration observed where the media was almost without dye in each case). Periodic sampling was performed to determine the percentage of decolorization, laccase activity ( Tinoco  et al., 2001), pH, and reducing 
sugars ( Miller  1959). On the other hand, some production parameters (e.g. biomass/ 
substrate yield) were determined (Y 
(x/s)  g g -1 ) and volumetric productivity (UL -1  h -1 ), 
(Rivera-Hoyos  et al., 2015). 
Adsorption studies 
For adsorption studies, a new batch of P. ostreatus  biomass was produced in broth 
WBE and separated by Àltration. Once inactive, the biomass was washed three times with distilled water and dried at 80 ºC to constant weight. This biomass was used for adsorption tests in closed containers. 
Kinetic studies for the removal of the two dyes at different pH values (4.0, 6.0 and 
8.0 ± 0.2) were done using non-viable biomass (NVB) from P. ostreatus  at a concentration 
of 0.5 % (w/v). Removal studies were carried out in 100 mL shake-Áasks with 50 mL Table 1. Plackett-Burman Experimental Design (PBED). TREATMENTS FACTORS

120 rpm for 180 minutes at 30 °C. To determine the residual concentration of dye 
(mg L -1 ), samples were taken at the starting point, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 90, 120, 
150 and 180 minutes. Value of q (amount of dye absorbed in mg per gram of fungal 
biomass added) was determined by using data from the residual dye adsorbed to the 
biomass (Eq. 1): 
(1)
Where C i and C t (mg L -1 ) are the initial and residual CV or MG concentrations at time 
to = 0 h and t = t (h), respectively, V is the solution volume (L) and X is the dry weight 
of fungal biomass (g). 
Different models such as pseudo-Àrst order, pseudo-second order, Elovich, 
intraparticle diffusion, and diffusion in liquid Àlm allowed the study of adsorption dynamics of dyes by the nonviable biomass (NVB). The following parameters were 
calculated according to the straight-line equation described by each model: Maximum 
amount of dye adsorbed in mg per gram of biomass ( qe ), Adsorption coefÀcient ( k), 
Adsorption coefÀcient of pseudo-second order ( k
2), Initial rate adsorption ( ) and 
Desorption coefÀcient ( ) and the Constant of Àlm difussion ( k) ( Table 2 ) ( Oladoja 
et al., 2008, Mahamadi & Mawere  2013). The residual root means the square errors 
(RMSE) and correlation coefÀcient (R 2) of kinetic models allowed measuring the 
goodness of Àt ( Puentes  et al., 2016). 
Determination of  germination index (GI) of  Lactuca sativa 
Germination tests using L. sativa  seeds were used to assess the effect of the initial 
(untreated) and Ànal dyes (treated with P. ostreatus  VB or NVB) in two different 
methodologies. The Àrst of them was denominated humid-chamber germination test (HCGT). For this, petri dishes of a 9 cm diameter and Whatman Àlter paper No. 3 were used. On the paper, 4 mL of each sample were added (100, 75, 50 and 25 % v/v) and 25 seeds of L. sativa  of similar sizes ( Celis  et al., 2006). The boxes were protected

consisted of placing the same number of seeds in 4 mL of solution (controls and 
treatments) maintained under constant agitation of 100 rpm at 22 ± 2 ºC for Àve 
days; this methodology was called Submerged Germination Test (SGT). The controls used were ZnSO 
4 (0.001 M) as positive control and distilled water as negative control. 
In both, 25 seeds were placed under the same conditions for each test. The response 
variable is the percentage of GI, which was determined following the methodology reported by Zucconi  et al. (1985) and calculated with equation 6: 
(6)
Where: GI is the germination index (%), G is the average number of germinated 
seeds in the analyzed sample, Gc  is the average number of germinated seeds in the 
negative control, L is the average length of the radicle in the sample (mm), and Lc  is 
the average length of the radicle in the negative control. When GI values are less than 50 %, it is considered that the substance generates high phytotoxicity on the plant model ( Emino & Warman  2004). 
Statistical analysis 
Design Expert 9.0 ® software allowed data variance and regression analysis for 
the PBED. SAS 9.0 ® software allowed mean comparison between treatments. A 
conÀdence interval of 95 % (alpha = 0.05) was used. 
A means comparison for removal kinetics with VB and NVB was made at the end 
of each kinetics using a Tukey test with a conÀdence interval of 95 %. Additionally, SAS software version 9.0 
® allowed correlation analysis between the percentage of  
decolorization and laccase activity. 
Results and Discussion 
Plackett-Burman Experimental Design 
Table 3  and Figures 1 A, B, C, and D show the results of PBED for both dyes and 
laccase activity. Regarding the MG, the model for decolorization showed an R 2 of  
0.78 and laccase activity showed an R 2 of 0.90 demonstrating that only laccase activity 
showed high correlation between predicted and observed values with adequate precision values of 8.6. For laccase activity, the factors with signiÀcant inÁuence were b, c, and d (pH, temperature and stirring speed) with p values equal to: 0.0386, 0.0193, and 0.0353 respectively. Regarding the percentage of decolorization, none of the factors had a signiÀcant effect over this variable (p > 0.05) ( Figure 1A ). According to 
the comparison of means between treatments for laccase, signiÀcant differences were observed (p < 0.0001): T 
10 , T 11  and T 3 the treatments that showed higher volumetric 
activity with values of 54.8 ± 8.9, 49.7 ± 2.8 and 42.7 ± 1.7 UL -1  respectively ( Figure 
1B ). For these treatments, the decolorization at the third day of evaluation was 
98.1 ± 0.04, 96.2 ± 0.1 and 96.3 ± 0.1 % respectively. Under the selected experimental conditions for this study, the removal experiments with MG dye were made using GI =G* L

25 °C, agitation 120 rpm, inoculum 2 % w/v, 10 g L -1  of glucose, and 0.5 g L -1  NH 4Cl). 
The results presented for CV showed best Àt with R 2 values of 0.82 and 0.95 for the 
percentage of decolorization and laccase activity. Moreover, the adequate precision was 4.65 and 35.04 respectively. Regarding the laccase activity for CVD, all factors had a signiÀcant effect on this variable ( Table 3 ); being the most inÁuential factors c, d, 
e, and a (temperature, stirring speed, percentage of inoculum, and dye concentration) with p values equal to 0.0001 (c and d), 0.0002 (e) and 0005 (a). The percentage of decolorization was not signiÀcantly affected by any of the factors (p > 0.05). According with the means comparison between treatments for enzymatic activity, the best were: T 
3, T 5, and T 6 with decolorization percentages of 97.1 ± 0.2 (T 3), 9 
6.8 ± 0.4 (T 5), and 98.3 ± 0.05 (T 6) at Àve days ( Figure 1C ). By getting similar 
decolorization for all three treatments, T 3 was then established as the standard 
treatment with the highest laccase activity (30.6 ± 2.9 UL -1 ). Removal experiments 
were then carried out using 10 mg L -1  CV , pH 6.0, temperature 30 °C, 120 rpm, 
agitation, inoculum 2 % (w/v), 5.0 g L -1  glucose, and 0.05 g L -1  NH 4Cl ( Figure 1D ). 
The reasons why the temperature and stirring speed were common factors for the two 
dyes that favored laccase´s activity might be related with various aspects. Regarding

biomass and the enzymatic reaction rate ( Patel & Gupte  2016). By raising the amount 
of biomass, the adsorption to the fungal biomass phenomena could beneÀt without 
losing the wall integrity. On the other hand, at higher temperatures, the diffusion rate of the dyes can be increased by a decrease in wall thickness; making the resistance 
to mass transfer smaller. Several authors ( Aravindan  et al., 2012; Puentes-Cardenas 
et al., 2012a; Puentes-Cardenas  et al., 2012b) have reported this effect. Additionally, 
the stirring speed promotes the transfer of oxygen from the aqueous medium to the 
biomass; therefore preventing the formation of anaerobic zones inside of the pellets 
or microaerophilic zones, which could affect the growth and availability of molecular oxygen as acceptor for subtracted electrons by the catalytic action of the laccase 
enzyme ( Zhang & Zhang  2015). 
Removal experiments for viable and non-viable biomass 
Decolorization for Crystal Violet and Malachite Green 
Percentages of decolorization for the two dyes with VB were gradually increasing 
from the Àrst sampling intervals and were signiÀcantly higher than those obtained 
with the NLB (p < 0.0001), reaching values of 98.2 ± 0.6 and 98.2 ± 0.1 % for MG and CV at 72 and 216 h respectively. The Ànal percentages were very similar for MG 
and CV . However, the comparison of means between sampling times determined 
that the maximum removal time for MG was obtained at 72 hours; being signiÀcantly less than for CV , since this dye needed between 120 and 216 hours to achieve a 
range of decolorization between 96 and 98 % (p < 0.0001). Regarding adsorptive 
decolorization (NVB), the percentages were 49.5 ± 2.9 and 45 ± 1.9 for MG and CV at 72 and 216 h respectively ( Figure 2 A , B). 
The highest response obtained with LB was due to two mechanisms that acts in 
a sequential manner. Initially, both dyes get adsorbed to the fungal wall through processes of physical/chemical type that are not associated with the metabolism of P. ostreatus  and are strongly inÁuenced by the pH, the dye concentration, 
temperature, and stirring speed ( Puentes-Cardenas  et al., 2012a; Puentes-Cardenas 
et al., 2012b; Castillo-Carvajal  et al., 2013). Subsequently, extracellular enzymes such 
as Laccase and MnP , among others, could modify the dyes. This transformation involves chemical alteration of the chromophore groups, which act as potential electron donors, generating changes in the absorption spectrum of both dyes (Casas  et al., 2009). 
Furthermore, the differences observed between dyes are related to the chemical 
structure of each one; to have complete decolorization of CV , demethylation of  three groups dimethyl is required (considered as chromophore groups), and for MG only two demethylations must be carried out. It is believed that laccase carries out these demethylations; therefore, an increase in enzyme activity and decolorization are simultaneous ( Vasdev , 2011). Other authors ( Lyra  et al., 2009; Kang  et al., 2014) have 
reported the effect of this type and a number of chemical substituents attached to the aromatic rings of the dyes on the capacity of decolorization with ligninolytic fungus. In their studies, they determined that dyes with more substitutions need longer processes and may slow the growing speed of fungi when used at very high concentrations. 268 Removal and detoxiÀcation of  Malachite Green and Crystal Violet

Figure 2C , and 2D  show results for Laccase and MnP enzymes in the presence 
and absence of colorants. Regarding laccase, it is possibly that activity was induced by the presence of the two dyes, showing a tendency to prolong for longer time. Laccase’s activity was quantiÀed in the absence of the two dyes and is higher in the Àrst sampling intervals, contrasting with the fact that at the end of the kinetics, its activity has decreased in 20 %. Enzyme activity was higher in the presence of  MG (20.5 ± 3.9 UL 
-1  at 72 h) than in CV (17.02 ± 2.3 UL -1  to 120 h) conÀrming the 
differences of structural complexity between MG and CV . 
Additionally, the high C/N ratio in the media with dye (Rhada Medium and dyes) 
could be another determining factor for higher enzymatic activity in the media without dye since fungi as P. ostreatus  produce higher amounts of enzymes under 
ligninolytic conditions (high C/N ratios). Similar results were reported by Pedroza- 
Rodríguez & Rodríguez-Vázquez  (2013). They showed that at low concentrations 
of nitrogen, ligninolytic enzymes increase signiÀcantly compared to a condition in which the nitrogen concentration is high and from organic nature, such as peptone or

Universitas Scientiarum Vol. 2 (): 25-25 http://ciencias.javeriana.edu.co/investigacion/universitas-scientiarum yeast extract. Also, the presence of aromatic compounds such as colorants and liquid 
waste from the paper industry tend to have high C/N ratio at the expense of a type 
of carbon difÀcult to degrade. 
MnP activity was only detected in the kinetics with MG at 12 hours and was lower 
than the laccase activity ( Figure 2D ) demonstrating that this enzyme was not 
primarily responsible for the decolorization because it has no activity on the CH3 
groups acting as chromophores. Probably MnP acted on the demethylated aromatic rings after laccase activity. Our results are consistent with those reported by Dashtban 
et al, (2010). In their article, Dashtban et al proposed that peroxidases, such as MnP , 
can act on simple phenolic rings and dyes provided that hydrogen peroxide, Mn 
+2 , 
and an organic acid are present for them to act as a natural chelator of Mn +3  oxidized 
by the enzyme. 
In the kinetics with MG, a low MnP activity was detected. MnP activity was not 
detected in the kinetics with CV . It was probably due to compounds with three carbon 
atoms in their structure (e.g. oxalic acid, malonate, and acetate). These compounds that could have acted as chelators of Mn 
+3  and promoted the oxidation of dyes 
to form free radicals might have been formed from the glucose metabolism and 
in connection with the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Moreover, the fungus may oxidize 
glucose through the glyoxal oxidase enzyme (EC 1.2.3.5) causing the reaction product hydrogen peroxide that plays an important role as a co-factor for MnP enzyme. 
The combined action of the two enzymes may facilitate the process of partial 
mineralization of dyes because the substitutions CH 
3 groups ( ortho , meta , and para ) 
are removed from the aromatic ring to generate unstable free radicals ultimately leading to the opening of the aromatic rings, the formation of intermediates of 3 carbons, and entrance to the Krebs cycle. 
The difference between decolorization and enzymatic activities was evident when 
performing the correlation analysis in which signiÀcant positive correlations (p < 0.05) between the percentage of decolorization and laccase activity (r = 0.95) were obtained. In contrast, the correlation between decolorization and MnP activity was negative and non-signiÀcant (p > 0.05, r = -0.23). 
In this sense, it is clear that the enzymatic activity changes according to the dye 
used even if they are from the same family. Kang  et al. (2014) studied the growth 
and decolorization of 12 ligninolytic fungi using MG and CV as colorants model. As in our study, the authors observed that not all fungi could grow in CV and the decolorization was more efÀcient in MG. They also demonstrated that the laccase activity is quantiÀable from the Àrst sampling intervals and gradually increases until reaching values close to 38 U mL 
-1 ; however, at a very high concentration of dyes, 
an inhibition of growth and 100 % decrease of the laccase activity was observed. A similar result was reported by Morales-Álvarez  et al. (2016) when they evaluated the 
effect of increasing concentrations of MG on the radial growth of G. lucidum . They 
found that at concentrations ranging between 10 and 50 mg L 
-1 , the growth of the 
fungi decreases when cultured in a chemically deÀned medium as agar Rhada. On the contrary, in complex media and with organic nitrogen, the concentration of the dye does not have such a marked effect. 270 Removal and detoxiÀcation of  Malachite Green and Crystal Violet 
Universitas Scientiarum Vol. 21 (3): 259-285 http://ciencias.javeriana.edu.co/investigacion/universitas-scientiarum Other results supporting differences in enzymatic activities in the presence and 
absence of dyes are the production parameters ( Table 4 ). Regarding the formed 
biomass and glucose consumption associated with yield Y (x/s) , a higher value appears 
when P. ostreatus  was not in contact with the dye; showing that although the fungus 
tolerated and discolor the two compounds, these could affect the primary metabolism 
of the same without being inhibitory. Furthermore, when analyzing the results 
associated with the volumetric activity and productivity at 72 and 216 hours, both dyes increase enzymatic activity when compared with the experiments in the absence 
of the dye; possibly by the induction that these exert on the laccase enzyme. In terms 
of productivity for the CV , calculations at 72 and 216 hours allowed to observe the differences and to make the comparison with the MG. According to the results in 
the presence of CV , productivity was lower at 216 hours and increased from 0.052 
to 0.159 UL 
-1  h -1  when the analysis was carried out at 72 h. In the absence of dyes, 
the results were lower for both 72 and 216 h (0.075 and 0.0029 UL -1  h -1  respectively). 
If these results are related to the percentage of decolorization, removal kinetics for 
CV could be successful in just 72 h; saving 144 h in processing time ( Ma  et al., 2014). 
Regarding the MG, the enzymatic activity and productivity were higher in the presence 
of the dye than CV ( Table 4 ). The percentages of decolorization at 72 hours exceeded 
90 %. Obtaining high percentages of removal in short periods of time is a very 
desirable factor when working with white rot fungi since executing scaling of processes 
where retention times are short is best to be able to treat larger wastewater volumes. Therefore, these unconventional systems could become competitive if compared to 
biological systems using aerobic or anaerobic bacteria ( Hai  et al., 2013, 
Ma  et al., 2014).

Universitas Scientiarum Vol. 2 (): 25-25 http://ciencias.javeriana.edu.co/investigacion/universitas-scientiarum Regarding glucose consumption, it was observed that in the experiments with dyes, 
P. ostreatus  was able to perform the remotion using low glucose concentrations 
(< 5 g L -1 ) which could be used as co-substrate to then use dyes as a more complex 
carbon source. These results are favorable considering the possibilities for scaling the process, as it would not be necessary to supplement the industrial efÁuent with high 
concentrations of glucose. 
On the other hand, a reduction on the pH was evidenced, which could be related with 
the production of some organic acids that are product of metabolism of sugars and 
thereof dyes. This decrease would not affect enzyme activity as it has been shown that both the laccase and peroxidases are active at low pHs greater than 3.0. Additionally, 
this drop in pH could also favor the removal of dye by adsorption to the fungal 
biomass, as seen later in the adsorption studies in function of pHs. 
Adsorption studies 
Effect of  pH on the adsorption of  MG and CV 
When obtaining high removal percentages using VB, a complementary study to model 
the phenomenon of adsorption of the dye to the fungal biomass was necessary. It was observed that the dyes concentration in the two compounds were rapidly adsorbed 
from the Àrst minutes of contact and reached equilibrium at 60 minutes. The effect of  
pH and the type of dye showed signiÀcant differences: with MG (p < 0.0001) ( Figure 
3A ) a pH 4.0 allowed the most adsorption, followed by the pH of 6.0 and 8.0; and with 
CV , adsorption at different pHs was also signiÀcant (p < 0.0001); However, at pH 4.0 
and 6.0 adsorption was similar (p > 0.0001) ( Figure 3B ).

Universitas Scientiarum Vol. 21 (3): 259-285 http://ciencias.javeriana.edu.co/investigacion/universitas-scientiarum The pH is an important factor for dye removal because it can increase or decrease 
the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent (fungal biomass). Given that both the 
MG and the CV are cationic dyes, increased adsorption was due to increasing pH 
because the negative charges of biomass should attract positive charges in the dye ( Cheng  et al., 2008, Sun  et al., 2008). However, the results obtained showed 
that it is possible to obtain greater adsorption at lower pH which is supported by 
the interaction of three factors. In the Àrst instance, the pK value for MG and CV are 6.9 and 8.6 respectively ( Fischer  et al., 2011, https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih. 
gov/compound/Crystal_violet#section=Top ). The pHs 4.0 and 6.0 are under the 
pK values in which the surface of the biomass does not have charge (i.e neutral). In addition, the adsorption could be happening because of interactions such as 
hydrogen bonds and Van der Waals forces ( Chergui  et al., 2009). Secondly, cationic 
dyes could act by chemisorption or by the formation of non ionic chemical complexes with uncharged ligands; which could favor the formation of ionic pairs 
that alter the electrostatic repulsion and favor adsorption ( Kaushik & Malik  2009). 
Finally, inactivation of fungal biomass increases its porosity; the contact surface and the exposure of the active sites that were potential binding sites for the dyes increase 
(Abdallah & Taha  2012). 
Morales-Alvarez  et al. (2016) reported a similar result. In their work, adsorption 
studies for MG were performed using Ganoderma lucidum  non-living biomass 
(NLB) and they obtained higher adsorbed concentrations per gram of biomass than those presented in this paper. They also showed that most adsorption occurred at 
acidic pH, potentially because of the thickness of the fungus wall of G. lucidum  wall 
and how it produces a large amount of exopolysaccharides that become binding sites for dyes. 
Adsorption kinetics 
Using the equations of the straight lines obtained when adjusting the data to models 
of pseudo-Àrst order and pseudo-second order, the values of k, k2, and qe  were found. 
These values correspond with the adsorption constant and the maximum value of dye adsorbed per gram of biomass used. The equations of the intraparticle diffusion and diffusion in Àlm models allowed us to Ànd K (constant of intraparticle diffusion and 
in Àlm). The Elovich model allowed us to Ànd the values of α and β corresponding to the initial rate of adsorption and the desorption constant ( Table 5 ), ( Sahmoune & 
Ouazene  2012). 
According to the values of R 2 represented in Table 5 , the model describing the 
adsorption for MG at acidic pHs and the CV in the three pHs was of pseudo-second- order: with values of R 
2 superior to 0.99, low RMSE (A smaller RMSE value indicates 
a better curve Àtting) and the linearity of the data was demonstrated in Figure 4A, 
B. However, for the MG at pH 8.0, the model of pseudo-second-order does not 
describe properly the adsorption (R 2 value of 0.9751, RMSE 0.0865, and the data 
presented in Figure 4A  have no linearity). These results indicate that basic pH affects 
adsorption; maybe related to the pK of the MG (possibly low value). On the other hand, MG was not sensitive to pH changes as when performing UV/Vis spectrum. At pH 3.0, there was no change and only at pH 8.0 a lower extinction coefÀcient was evidenced (data not shown). 273 Morales-lvarez et al

Universitas Scientiarum Vol. 21 (3): 259-285 http://ciencias.javeriana.edu.co/investigacion/universitas-scientiarum Regarding the pseudo-second order model, it was deduced that it is related to the 
adsorption capacity of the adsorbent and that the process may be taking place by chemisorptions. Some processes of biosorption of cationic dyes that are reported in the literature Àt this model and are similar to those obtained in this work ( Sun  et al., 
2008, Chowdhury  et al., 2011, and Kumar & Ahmad  2011). 
Previous studies have demonstrated that in the model of pseudo-Àrst order, the 
increase in the adsorption coefÀcient (k) is proportional to the number of free sites on the surface of the adsorbent ( Chergui  et al., 2009). Therefore, the results of  
obtained k indicate that in the case of MG, at lower pH (4.0 and 6.0), there is a higher number of free sites exposed on the surface which might attract the dye. The CV has some structural differences in relation to MG, such as the chlorine ion and a higher methylations number, which could change the way that the dye interaction takes place with the free sites exposed to the three pHs as the value of k was similar ( 
Table 5 ), 
(Supplementary material A). 
Authors like Dotto & Pinto  (2011), Dotto  et al. (2013), and Morales-Alvarez  et al. 
(2016) have demostrated that the Elocvich model helps support the adsorption by chemisorption. For this model, the adsorption rate decreases with time by the saturation of chitin and chitosan. For this reason, the initial rate of absorption (α) was lower at pH 4.0 and 6.0 than pH 8.0 for both dyes. In relation to the desorption coefÀcient (β), the highest values were obtained for the CV at the three pHs which could indicate that P. ostreatus  biomass has less afÀnity for the CV than for the MG whose desorption

observed in the kinetics of removal with fungal biomass in which decolorization for 
CV was lower and longer than for MG (216 h) ( Table 5 ). 
Intraparticle diffusion model presented in Table 5  suggests that the existing linearity 
between q t and t 1/2  is due to the intraparticle diffusion mechanism. According to 
the results, trend lines do not pass through the origin implying that the adsorption occurred by more than one mechanism and in two different phases ( Gulnaz  et al., 
2006). It is possible that the Àrst had been a superÀcial adsorption of the dye until 
reaching saturation. After that, the dye entered through the porosity of the wall fragments and it was adsorbed to the internal active sites (intraparticle diffusion), 
(Sahmoune & Ouazene  2012). On the other hand, the bilinearity of the data has 
also been reported as an indicator of the presence of two different types of pores in the adsorbent (macropores and micropores), ( Chergui  et al., 2009). The process of  
inactivation of the fungal biomass by wet heat and pressure determines that the fungal 
wall is lysed, and fragments of different sizes are formed, in which different pore sizes may be present, leaving exposed multiple active sites ( 
Table 5 ), (Supplementary 
material B). 
The results obtained for the intraparticle diffusion model, could indicate that the dyes 
were transported to the surface of the biomass. Since this model is used to describe the Áow of reactant (dye) through the surrounding Áuid of the adsorbent surface 
(biomass), ( Sen-Gupta & Bhattacharyya  2011), ( 
Table 5 ), (Supplementary Material C). 
Determination of  index germination of  Lactuca sativa 
The humid-chamber germination test (HCGT) and submerged germination test (SGT) 
exposed the response that has a biological vegetable model in the presence of the initial dyes and treated with viable biomass and non-viable biomass of P. ostreatus . With 
the data obtained the GI (%) was calculated which served as a standard to evaluate the toxicity from a substance to a plant. When the values of this index are lower than 50 %, it is considered that the substance generates high phytotoxicity on the evaluated plant (Emino & Warman  2004). 
According to the results obtained for the MG and CV at 10 mg L 
-1  ( Table 6 ), the two 
dyes untreated exert high phytotoxicity in seeds of L. sativa  as it has a GR lower than 
50 % in the two methodologies evaluated (HCGT and SGT). When performing the treatment with VB from P. ostreatus  at 100 % (v/v) concentration, the GR increased 
above 50 % for the two dyes in the two methodologies. This demonstrated that the combined mechanisms of adsorption and biotransformation lowered the adverse effect exerted by the dyes on the seed. However, they were not equal to the control with water (GR 100 %), which could be related to the presence of some intermediaries present after treatment; they do not absorb in the visible spectrum and are not evident in the residual color. For this reason, they could be part of the 2 % of the residual decolorization obtained at 72 and 216 h of treatment. 
When dilutions of the two dyes were made (50 % and 25 %), an increment was detected 
in the GI being more evident for the CV in the submerged germination tests (SGT) than for those performed for humid-chamber germination tests (HCGT). Regarding the MG, the GR results in both concentrations tested were similar. 276 Removal and detoxiÀcation of  Malachite Green and Crystal Violet

Universitas Scientiarum Vol. 2 (): 25-25 http://ciencias.javeriana.edu.co/investigacion/universitas-scientiarum In tests using the post-treated dye solution with NVB at 100 % was shown that GR 
were lower than, those obtained with VB (31, 13, 46, and 2.1 for MG and CV in HCGT 
and SGT), exerting a higher phytotoxic effect ( Table 6 ). This could relate to the 
removal mechanism of VB which is of physical/chemical type and does not involve the enzymatic transformation. On the other hand, these results also help support the 
great complexity of CV and very probable its higher toxicity just as reported by other 
authors ( Ayed  et al. 2009, Parshetti  et al. 2011). 
Regarding dilutions of the dye solutions post-treated with NVB at 50 and 25 %, 
an increase in the GR was seen (higher in MG than in CV), when evaluated in humid-chamber germination test (HCGT), in contrast to what was observed 
in submerged germination test (SGT) were the values were lower, especially with 
the CV . When analyzing the results based on the methodologies used in most experiments, the values of GR for SGT were lower than the germination tests in 
humid chamber. This could be due to two factors ( Table 6 ). On one side, the seeds 
used in a humid chamber were under a higher surface aeration than the seeds submerged. The increased surface aeration could affect the ATP production by 
respiratory pathway, as in the case of lettuce seeds, it has been reported low production 
of ATP by fermentative pathways ( Hourmant & Pradet  1981). Furthermore, 
Yazgan  et al. (2008) report that excess moisture can decrease the active form of  
the phytochrome which acts directly on the germination of lettuce-seeds ( Ojeda 
et al. 2012). 
The toxic effect of MG on the elongation of the radicle has been previously reported 
by several authors using concentrations of 1000 mg L 
-1  and 100 mg L -1  in other plant 
models ( Triticum aestivum , Ervum lens Linn , and Sorghum bicolor ) ( Ayed  et al. 2010, and 
Shedbalkar & Jadhav  2011). The same authors conducted biological treatments of  
the dyes and obtained a reduction in toxicity evidenced by the parameter of radicular elongation. For the CV , they have also performed several studies showing its toxicity (Nouren & Bhatti  2015). 
Finally, considering that in the case of treatment with VB from P. ostreatus  where 
GI was increased and raised to 50 %, it is possible to suggest that the toxicity generated by MG and CV is highly reduced in this treatment. Therefore, post-treated efÁuents could be used concentrated or diluted as irrigation water for plants other than for human or animal consumption (e.g. watering gardens and parks, or for walls and green roofs that handle hydroponic systems to keep moisture at appropriate levels to encourage the growth and maintenance of these green technologies). Moreover, we can use these solutions again for the manufacture of Gram stains and other specialized stains if the levels of conductivity and dissolved solids do not affect the quality of the stains. 
UV/VIS Spectrum 
To initial and post-treated dyes, UV/Vis spectrum were performed to show if changes 
in the maximum absorption peaks were present in the visible spectrum and if there were new peaks in the ultraviolet spectrum that could be related to the degradation intermediates ( Figure 5 ). These studies also helped support some of the changes that 
occurred in germination studies with L. sativa  seeds. 278 Removal and detoxiÀcation of  Malachite Green and Crystal Violet 
Universitas Scientiarum Vol. 21 (3): 259-285 http://ciencias.javeriana.edu.co/investigacion/universitas-scientiarum The CV without treatment showed a peak of maximum absorption at λ = 590 nm and 
two smaller peaks at λ = 305nm and λ = 250nm ( Figure 5A ) which are related to the 
chromophore group (central carbon or methane group bonded to three aryl groups) and aromatic rings attached to the dye. The maximum absorption peak for the MG was at λ = 615 nm with two additional signals at λ = 425nm and λ = 315nm ( Figure 5B ). 
Structurally the difference with the CV lies in several facts: 
i)  The solubilizing groups that each one possesses; where in the CV is the 
C
l-  ion and in the MG the oxalate ion (C 2O4-2 ). 
ii) The number of substitutions; as the CV has three dimethyl groups 
as chromophore groups in comparison to the two that are in the MG; determining characteristics at the time of degradation. Since the dyes that have a higher number of substitutions present greater complexity and therefore, require longer processing times. 
It was observed that VB at 216 and 72 h, the peaks in the visible range disappeared 
for the two dyes without new signals in the UV spectrum. The disappearance could be related to the complete transformation process of the dyes in which aliphatic or dissolved intermediaries were left as sulfate, chloride, among others ions intermediaries. By contrast, with NVB we obtained a decreased area under the curve in the visible range for the two dyes, but was not a complete disappearance, which could be due to adsorption but not transformation. The UV signals tend to stay constant but with lower areas than those of the initial dye.

This study demonstrated that two dyes belonging to the family of the triphenylmethane, 
a combined process of physical-chemical-enzymatic type, removed MG and CV 
by using P. ostreatus  at laboratory scale. The results showed that the laccase activity 
and decolorization were mainly under the inÁuence of parameters such as pH, 
temperature, stirring rate, percentage of inoculum, and dyes concentration. According 
to the obtained kinetics of removal, using viable biomass increased signiÀcantly the decoloration and the presence of the dyes induced enzymatic activity; suggesting that 
laccase plays an important role in the attack to the structure of the dyes and therefore 
to their biodegradation. Additionally, with the UV/VIS spectrum, it was determined that in the experiments with viable biomass, there could have occurred a mechanism 
of biotransformation combined with an adsorption phenomena and in the case of  
using non-viable biomass, as expected, a phenomenon of adsorption without chemical alteration of the two dyes predominated. In addition, we observed the phytotoxic effect 
of the initial dyes with values of GI in seeds of L. sativa  below 50 %. It also showed 
that when the seeds were placed against the treated dyes with VB, the GI increased, leaving open the possibility of reusability of the aqueous dye solutions (once treated); 
demonstrated as well that highly toxic compounds such as MG and CV can be degraded 
by P. ostreatus .

Eliminación parcial y desintoxicación de Verde Malaquita y Cristal Violeta del laboratorio con 
agua contaminada arti/f_icialmente por Pleurotus ostreatus 
Resumen.  Los colorantes trifenilmetánicos Verde Malaquita (MG) y Crystal Violeta (CV) son 
catiónicos y al ser vertidos se mezclan con aguas residuales domésticas, incrementando, entre otros, 
la demanda química y biológica de oxígeno; pudiendo causar toxicidad aguda en diferentes niveles tróÀcos. En este estudio se encontró que los parámetros pH (4,5 y 6,0), temperatura (25 y 30 °C), 
velocidad de agitación (120 r.p.m.), porcentaje de inóculo (2 % v/v) y concentración de colorante (20 
y 10 mgL 
-1 ), presentaron un efecto signiÀcativo (p < 0.05) para favorecer la remoción (decoloración) 
de MG y CV , así como la actividad lacasa (54,76 ± 8,91 y 30,59 ± 2,89 UL -1  respectivamente) al utilizar 
biomasa viable de P. ostreatus . En los estudios de adsorción se evidenció que pH ácidos favorecen 
la adsorción de ambos colorantes y que el modelo de Pseudo-segundo orden describe mejor el 
fenómeno de quimisorción. Finalmente los índices de germinación (IG) empleando semillas de 
Lactuca sativa , para los colorantes iniciales fueron < 50 %; demostrando su efecto Àtotóxico elevado. 
Cuando las soluciones de colorantes fueron tratadas con biomasa viable, el IG aumentó, dejando 
abierta la puerta para la realización de investigaciones futuras con la intensión de determinar si las 
soluciones acuosas, postratadas con P. ostreatus , pueden ser utilizadas en tratamientos que generen 
aguas menos tóxicas y que estas puedan ser empleadas en otros procesos que no requieran agua 
potable.

Resumen.  Os corantes de tipo trifenilmetano Verde Malaquita (VM) e Cristal Violeta (CV) são 
corantes catiônicos e se misturam com águas residuais domésticas quando descartadas; aumentando, entre outros, as demandas químicas e biológicas de oxigênio, podendo causar toxicidade aguda em diferentes níveis tróÀcos. Promoveu-se a remoção (descoloração) de VM e CV , e atividade da lacase (54.8 ± 8.9 e 30.6 ± 2.9 UL 
-1  respectivamente) utilizando como parâmetros necessários para a 
biomassa viável de P. ostreatus  como pH (4,5 e 6,0), temperatura (25 a 30 °C), velocidade de agitação 
(120 RPM), porcentagem de inócuo (2 % v/v), e concentração de corante (20 e 10 mg L -1 ). Em 
estudos de absorção, se demonstrou que um pH mais ácido favorece a absorção de ambos corantes e o modelo de pseudo-segunda ordem descreve melhor o fenômeno da absorção. Finalmente, o índice de germinação (IG), utilizando sementes de Lactuca sativa  para as soluções iniciais dos corantes, 
foi < 50 %; demonstrando assim seu alto efeito Àtotóxico. Quando as soluções de corante foram tratadas com a biomassa viável, o IG aumentou, deixando em aberto a possibilidade de realizar futuras investigações para determinar se as soluções aquosas, tratadas com P. ostreatus , poderiam ser 
utilizadas em tratamentos que gerem águas menos tóxicas, que poderia ser utilizada em processos que não requerem água potável.
