Hyaluronidases are responsible for the degradation of hyaluronic acid (HA), an 
important polysaccharide abundant in the extracellular matrix, especially in the skin. Its 
quantity and size are regulated by bovine testicular hyaluronidase enzyme (B TH), which 
randomly cleaves the long chains to eventually produce tetr asaccharide (Tet). Capillar y 
electrophoresis (CE) off line based assays and microscale thermophoresis (MST) were used to 
check the effect of glycerol and Tween-2 0 on the catalytic activity of BTH. CE provides 
information on the kinetic activity of BTH by quantifying the Tet product wher eas MST allows, 
among others, the determination of the binding affinity between BTH and smal l molecules from 
µM to p M scale [1]. 
In this study, glycerol  and Tween-20  were selected t o investigate the ir effect on BTH storage 
conditions and to improve MST experimental results , respectively . Indeed, glycerol, a viscous , 
low volatile colorless and odorless liquid has been widel y described  to stabilize some enzymes 
when store d at -20°C [2] . Tween -20 or polysorbate 20, a viscous liquid, is a common surfactant 
used to avoid protein adsorption on the inner wall of glass capi llaries us ed in MS T experiments 
[3]. MST m easurements require one of the investigated par tners to be fluorescent  either at n ative 
state or by adding exogenous dye. Fluorescence signals provide informati on on the distribution of 
the labelled protein solution inside the capillary , in the presence and  absence of  additives , 
revealing adsorption phenomena . Moreover , MST thermographs indicate t he state of  the protein  
in solution;  soluble or aggregate d, free or bounde d [1]. 
In this study, different concentrations of glycerol  (0.02% , 2%, 10% and 20 %) and Tween- 20 
(0.005, 0.01, 0.02 and 0.05%) were added to BTH solutions a nd their influence s were monitored 
systematically by CE a nd MST.  
CE results showed that l abelling  affect t he catalytic activity o f BTH as shown i n Fig.1a and  Fig2.a. 
Moreover, CE results showed a significant  decreas e of the catalytic a ctivity of l abelled and  
unlabelle d BTH in the presence of  increasing amount of glycerol  in the reaction  media. For  
instance, the  catalytic a ctivity  of unlabelled BTH and labelle d BTH was reduced by a factor of 2 
in the presence of  20%  of glycerol  (Fig.1a) . This observation is in total a greement with our 
previous study carried out on the effect of PEG 6000 on the catalytic activity of unlabelled BTH 
[4]. The results showed that the catalytic activity was strongly dependant on the crowding of the 
reaction  media and i ts viscosity that resulted in reducing of the enzyme ki netic a ctivity . 
The MST  results  of labelled BTH stored in the absence of glycerol , fluorescence signal s were 
similar regardless the  percentages  of glycerol added to the labelled BTH  scanned solution at final 
concentration of 1nM  as shown in Fig.1b. Additionally, corresponding MST thermographs were 
consistent  at all tested percentages with an exception of solutions containing 20% of glycerol  
where MST traces were less repr oducible (Fig.1b’). On the other hand, MST fluorescence signal 
result s revealed that labelled BTH stored in the presence of 20% of glycerol  (stock solution 
concentrations equal to 8.1µM)  compared to aliquots stored in its absence preserves  a good 
fluorescence signal as shown in Fig.1c and c’. 
CE results presented in Fig. 2a showed tha t the catalytic activity  of labelled B TH was reduced by 
20 % in the presence of 0.05% of Tween- 20. At the same final percentage of Tween -20, the 
catalytic  activity of unlabelled BTH was unchanged compared to reactions carried out in its 
absence. Finally, the fluorescence signal of labelled BTH obtained with different percentages of  Tween -20 was fairly constant as shown in Fig.2b and the corresponding  thermophoretic graphs 
were perfectly stackable in all tested conditions as shown in Fig.2c . 
 
To conclude, glycerol influences the catalytic activity of labelled and unlabelled BTH but it has limited effect on thermophoretic movement of labelled BTH unless  it is presented at very high 
quantity (> 20%). Tween - 20 has a limited effect on catalytic activity on labelled and unlabelled 
BTH with no incidence on labelled BTH thermophoretic signals.
