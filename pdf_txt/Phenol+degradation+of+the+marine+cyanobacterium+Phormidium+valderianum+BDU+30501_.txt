The use of microbial catalysts in the biodegradatio n of organic compounds has advanced significantly 
during the past three decades. It has been found th at large numbers of microbes co-exist in almost all  
natural environments, particularly in soils. Many n atural and synthetic organic chemicals are readily 
biodegradable in natural environment. Biodegradatio n of materials involve initial proximity, allowing 
adsorption or physical access to the substrate, sec retion of extra cellular enzymes to degrade the 
substrates or uptake via transport systems followed  by intracellular metabolism. The efficiency of 
biodegradation of organic compounds is influenced b y the type of the organic pollutant, the nature of 
the organism, the enzyme involved, the mechanism of degradation and the nature of the influencing 
factors. Phenolic compounds are hazardous pollutant s that are toxic at relatively low concentration. 
Accumulation of phenol creates toxicity both for fl ora and fauna. Since phenol is toxic and cause poll ution, 
it must be removed from the environment. 
 
Key words: Biodegradation, organic compounds, pollution. 
 
 
INTRODUCTION                 
 
Organic pollutants comprise a potential group of chemi -
cals which can be dreadfully hazardous to human health.  
Many of these are resistant to degradation. As they 
persist in the environment, they are capable of long range 
transportation, bioaccumulation in human and animal 
tissue and biomagnification in food chain. 
Biodegradation is used to describe the complete 
mineralization of the starting compound to simpler on es 
like CO 2, H 2O, NO 3 and other inorganic compounds 
(Atlas and Bartha, 1998). The term has been proposed  
for describing the ultimate degradation and recycling o f 
an organic molecule to its mineral constituents.  Accord -
ing to Alexander (1965) no natural organic compound i s 
totally resistant to biodegradation provided that th e 
environmental conditions are favourable. This is know n 
as the principle of microbial infallibility. 
Microbiologists have hardly dipped below the surface o f 
the natural pool of microbial diversity. When new or gani-
sms have been isolated with biodegradation efficien cy, 
their biochemical versatility has been found to be 
immense. Attempts to determine microbial diversity i n 
natural environments like soil are limited by the in ability of

a particular environmental sample. However, the isol ation 
of those microbes will often require a targeted inte lligent 
approach to screen the biosphere for its presence 
(Wackette and Hershberger, 2001).  
The massive mobilization of compounds in natural 
resources or the introduction of xenobiotics into the 
biosphere leads to unidirectional fluxes, which resul t in 
the persistence of a number of chemicals in the 
biosphere and thus constitute a source of contamination . 
Phenol and its higher homology are aromatic molecules 
containing hydroxyl group attached to the benzene ring 
structure. The origin of phenol in the environment i s both 
industrial and natural. Phenol pollution is associate d with 
pulp mills, coal mines, refineries, wood preservatio n 
plants and various chemical industries as well as the ir 
wastewaters (Paula and Young, 1998). Natural sources 
of phenol include forest fire, natural run off from  urban 
area where asphalt is used as the binding material and 
natural decay of lignocellulosic material. The presence of 
phenol in water imparts carbolic odor to receiving wat er 
bodies and can cause toxic effects on aquatic flora and 
fauna (Ghadhi and Sangodkar, 1995). Phenols are toxic 
to human beings and affect several biochemical functi ons 
(Nuhoglu and Yalcin, 2005). Phenol is also a priorit y 
pollutant and is included in the list of EPA (1979) .  4952         Afr. J. Biotechnol.

Properties             
 
They may be colourless solids or thick liquids, often 
contains a pink tint owing to the presence of oxidation  
products. Phenol is a hygroscopic, crystalline solid with  
distinctive odour and is acidic. Molecular weight of ph enol 
is 94.11, the density is 1.072 and the boiling poin t is 
181.9° C. 
 
 
TOXICITY OF PHENOL  
 
Acute exposure of phenol causes central nervous system 
disorders. It leads to collapse and coma. Muscular 
convulsions are also noted. A reduction in body tempe-
rature is resulted and this is known as hypothermia. 
Mucus membrane is highly sensitive to the action of 
phenol. Muscle weakness and tremors are also observ-
ed. Acute exposure of phenol can result in myocardial 
depression. Phenol  causes a burning effect on skin. 
Whitening and erosion of the skin may also result due  to 
phenol exposure. Phenol has an anaesthetic effect and 
causes gangrene. Renal damage and salivation may be 
induced by continuous exposure to phenol. 
Exposure to phenol may result in irritation of the e ye, 
conjunctional swelling, corneal whitening and final ly 
blindness. Other effects include frothing from nose  and 
mouth followed by headache. Phenol can cause hepatic  
damage   also.  Chronic  exposure  may  result  in  anorexia,    
 
 
 
dermal rash, dysphasia, gastrointestinal disturbance , 
vomiting, weakness, weightlessness, muscle pain, hep atic 
tenderness and nervous disorder.  It is also suspected that  
exposure to phenol may cause paralysis,  cancer and 
genetofibre striation. Phenol and its derivatives a re toxic 
and classified as hazardous materials (Zumriye and 
Gultac, 1999). These phenolic compounds possess 
various degrees of toxicity and their fate in the 
environment is therefore important (Bollag et al ., 1988). 
In recent years, a great deal of research work has been  
directed toward the development processes in which 
enzymes are used to remove phenolic contaminants 
(Ghioureliotis and Nicell, 1999). Phenol is an antis eptic 
agent and is used in surgery, which indicates that they are 
also toxic to many microorganisms (EPA, 1979).  
 
 
MICROORGANISMS IN PHENOL BIODEGRADATION  
 
Degradation of phenol occurs as a result of the activit y of 
a large number of microorganisms including bacteria, 
fungi and actinomycetes (Table 1). Bacterial species 
include Bacillus sp , Pseudomonas  sp , Acinetobacte r sp , 
Achromobacte r sp  etc. Fusarium sp , Phanerocheate  
chrysosporium , C orious  versicolo r, Ralstonia sp , 
Streptomyces sp  etc are also proved to be efficient fungal 
groups in phenol biodegradation. However, these 
microorganisms suffer from substrate inhibition at h igher 
concentration of phenol, by which the growth is inhibit ed 
(Prieto et al., 2002).  
Many studies on biodegradation of phenol come from 
bacteria. The genus Pseudomonas  is widely applied for 
the degradation of phenolic compounds. These bacteria 
are known for their immense ability to grow on variou s 
organic compounds. Phenol biodegradation studies with  
the bacterial species have resulted in bringing out t he 
possible mechanism and also the enzyme involved in the 
process. The efficiency of the phenol degradation could 
be further enhanced by the process of cell immobilization  
(Annadurai et al., 2000a, b). Phenol and other phen olic 
compounds are common constituents of many industrial 
effluents. Once a suitable micro organism based proce ss 
is developed for the effective degradation of pheno l these 
phenolic effluents can be safely treated and disposed 
(Borghei and Hosseini, 2004).  Candida tropicalis  RETL-
Crl from the effluent of the Exxon Mobile Oil Refiner y 
waste water treatment was investigated for phenol 
degradation using batch and fed batch fermentation 
under aerobic condition (Mohd Tuah, 2006). Microbiolo-
gical degradation of phenol and some of its alkyl 
derivatives (p-cresol, 4-n-propyl phenol, 4-i -propyl 
phenol, 4-n-butyl phenol, 4-sec-butyl phenol, 4-t-bu tyl 
phenol and 4-t-octyl phenol) were examined under bot h 
aerobic and anaecrobic conditions in seven Japanese 
paddy soil samples (Atsushi et al ., 2006). The rate of 
biodegradation of phenol by Klebsiella oxytoca  strain was 
studied. It was found that K. oxytoca  degraded phenol at 
elevated concentration where 75% of  initial  phenol  con-  Nair et al.        4953

centration at 100 ppm was degraded within 72 h 
(Shawabkeh et al., 2007). Phenol was degraded by 
Actinobacillus species ( Khleifat and Khaled, 2007). They 
found that pH 7, the incubation temperature of 35 to  
37° C, and the agitation rate of 150 rpm were the op timal 
conditions for achieving the higher percentage of phen ol 
degradation.  Succinic acid and glycine as respective 
carbon and nitrogen source were found to be the most 
efficient co-substrates for the removal of phenol. 
Immobilized Alcaligenes sp d 2 was successfully used for 
the effective treatment of phenolic paper factory efflu ent 
(Nair and Shashidhar, 2007). 
 
 
MECHANISM OF PHENOL BIODEGRADATION  
 
Generally aromatic compounds are broken down by 
natural bacteria. However, polycyclic aromatic com-
pounds are more recalcitrant. Derivatisation of aroma tic 
nuclei with various substituents particularly with halo gens 
makes them more recalcitrant. There are reports on 
many microorganisms capable of degrading phenol 
through the action of variety of enzymes. These enzymes 
may include oxygenases hydroxylases, peroxidases, 
tyrosinases and oxidases (Table 2).  
Oxygenases   include   monoxygenases  and  dioxygen ases.  The critical step in the metabolism of aromatic com-
pounds is the destruction of the resonance structure b y 
hydroxylation and fission of the benzoid ring which is 
achieved by dioxygenase-catalysed reactions in the 
aerobic systems. Based on the substrate that is attack ed 
by the ring cleaving enzyme dioxygenase, the aromatic 
metabolism can be grouped as catechol pathway, 
gentisate pathway, and proto catechaute pathway.  In al l 
these pathways, the ring activation by the introductio n of 
hydroxyl groups is followed by the enzymatic ring 
cleavage. The ring fission products, then undergoes t ran-
sformations leading to the general metabolic pathway s of 
the organisms. Most of the aromatic catabolic pathways 
converge at catechol. Catechols are formed as inter-
mediates from a vast range of substituted and non-
substituted mono and poly aromatic compounds. 
Aerobically, phenol also is first converted to catechol , and 
subsequently, the catechol is degraded via ortho or me ta 
fission to intermediates of central metabolism. The initial 
ring fission is catalysed by an ortho cleaving enzyme, 
catechol 1, 2 dioxygenase or by a meta cleaving enzyme 
catechol 2,3 dioxygenase, where the product of ring 
fission is a cis-muconic acid for the former and 2-hydr o 
cis muconic semi aldehyde for the latter 
(Gurujeyalakshmi and Oriel, 1988).

compounds such as phenol or benzoate via an ortho 
cleavage pathway using catechol 1,2 dioxygenase (An et  
al ., 2001). These dioxygenases are highly labile enzymes 
and there requires a detailed investigation into it s 
structural properties. A bacterial strain, Serratia plymuthi-
ca  was able to tolerate phenol up to a concentration of  
1050 mg/L. Phenol was degraded through ortho pathwa y 
and the crude extract showed the presence of ring 
cleaving enzyme catechol 1, 2-dioxygenase (Nilotpala 
and Ingle, 2007).   
Catechols are cleaved either by ortho-fission (intradi ol, 
that is, carbon bond between two hydroxyl groups or by a  
meta-fission (extra diol, that is, between one of t he 
hydroxyl groups and a non-hydroxylated carbon) as given  
in Figures 2 and 3. Thus the ring is opened and the   open  Nair et al.        4955

ring is degraded (Cerniglia, 1984). As a general ru le, 
most of the halo aromatics are degraded through the 
formation of the respective halocatechols, the ring fi ssion 
of which takes place via ortho-mode. On the other hand , 
most of the non halogenated aromatic compounds are 
degraded through meta pathway.  4956         Afr. J. Biotechnol. 
 
 
 
The fission product of ortho-cleavage would be cis, ci s 
muconic acid or its derivative depending on whether th e 
catechol is substituted or not. The meta-fission prod uct of 
catechol would be 2-hydroxy muconic semialdehyde and 
the products of both ortho and meta pathways are furt her 
metabolized as intermediates of TCA cycle. Ortho-
pathway is the most productive pathway for the organis m 
as it involves less expenditure of energy.                  
Phenol hydroxylase (E. C 14. 1.3.7) catalyses the 
degradation of phenol via two different pathways ini tiated 
either by ortho or meta cleavage. There are many rep orts 
on phenol hydroxylase and catechol 2, 3 dioxygenase 
involved in the biodegradation of phenol (Leonard a nd 
Lindley, 1999). Hublik and Schinner (2000) reported th e 
characterization of laccase from Penurious ostreatus . 
The enzyme was purified to homogeneity and was 
characterized. It was a monomeric protein with a 
molecular weight of 67 KD and with an isoelectric poin t of 
3.6. They observed that the laccase retained most of i ts 
activity in high ionic buffer, pH.10, 20° C temperature  in 
the presence of 10 mM benzoic acid and with 35% 
ethylene glycol. The degradation of phenolic compounds 
by immobilised laccase from Streptomyces psammoticus  
was evaluated and confirmed by thin layer chromato-
graphy and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 
(Niladevi and Prema, 2007).  
Polyphenol oxidase is a (EC 1.14.18.1) monoxygenase  
which catalyses the O-hydroxylation of phenols and t he 
oxidation of O-dihydric phenols to O-quinones using 
molecular oxygen. Laccase are phenol oxidases which 
utilize molecular oxygen. They are known to have the 
ability to oxidize polyphenols, meta substituted pheno ls, 
diamines and a variety of other components (Kadhim, 
1999). The mechanism by which polyphenol oxidase 
catalyses the conversion of monophenols to O-quinones 
involves the hydroxylation of monophenols followed by 
dehydrogenation to form O-quinones. These quinones 
undergo spontaneous nonenzymatic polymerization in 
water, eventually forming water insoluble polymers w hich 
can be separated from water by filtration (Edwards et  al., 
1999).  
There were various reports on the exploitation of 
polyphenol oxidase in the detoxification of the phenols . 
The interest in polyphenol oxidase had been fueled by 
their potential uses in detoxification of environment al 
pollutants (Bollag et al., 1988). Production of usef ul 
chemicals from lignin (Burton et al., 1993) by polyphen ol 
oxidase was also reported. Garzillo et al . (1998) reported 
a polyphenol oxidase from the white rot fungus Trametes 
trogii . It was an enzyme with molecular weight 70 KD. 
The purified enzyme oxidised a number of phenolic 
compounds. This multicopper oxidases had a wide range  
of substrate specificity.  Coprinus macrorhizus  and 
Arthromyces ramosus were proved to be effective in 
removing phenol and phenolic compounds from water  (Wu 
et al.,  1998). Of the various enzymes acting on  phenol, 
polyphenol oxidase was the most important one probably  
because of its increasing  demand  in  lignin  degrada tion   
 
 
 
(Garzillo et al., 1998). The non specific nature of t he 
polyphenol oxidase was also discussed by Schneider et 
al . (1999). 
Immobilised polyphenol oxidase on chitosan coated 
polysulphone capillary membranes were used for impr oved 
phenolic effluent bioremediation (Edwards et al., 19 99). 
They also highlighted the removal of quinones and o ther 
polymerized products using chitosan. Polyphenol oxid ases 
were widely distributed in many plants and fungal spe cies 
(Robles et al.,  2000). They suggested the possibility of 
using a polyphenol oxidase producing strain of the 
hyphomycete Chalara paradoxa  in the detoxification of 
olive mill wastewater.   
Sakurai et al . (2001) showed that the peroxidase from 
Coprinus cinereus could be used for the removal of 
Bisphenol. Polymerization of the bisphenol by the 
enzyme was utilized here. Manophenols in aqueous 
solution could also be removed by peroxidase catalysed 
oxidation (Xia et al., 2003).  
Certain actinomyces and Streptomyces  strains could 
produce tyrosinase enzyme, which oxidized halogen 
substituted phenols. Peroxidases could catalyse the 
transformation of phenol and halogenated phenols. 
Peroxidases such as those from Arthrobacter  and 
Streptomyces  strains were being reported as the phenol 
degrading enzymes (Fetzner and Lingens, 1994). The 
peroxidase catalysed polymerization process was proved 
to be very effective in eliminating phenol and a vari ety of 
other aromatic pollutants from waste waters (Ghioure liotis 
and Nicell, 1999). Peroxidases can act on phenol and 
other aromatic compounds through oxidative coupling. In  
presence of hydrogen peroxide two equivalents of phen ol 
are converted by each equivalent of enzyme into highly 
reactive radical species. Once they are formed, they 
react with one another to yield phenolic polymers. 
Tyrosinase catalyzes the oxidation of phenols involving  
the formation of orthoquinones. The mechanism of the  
enzymatic action of tyrosinase on various phenols was 
discussed in detail by Siegbahn (2003). 
The mechanism of degradation of an organic compound 
may be unusual (Jenisch-Anton, 1999). The mechanism 
of degradation is generally decided by the nature of the 
organic compound, its solubility, and nature of the 
organism, type of the enzyme and also by the external 
factors affecting biodegradation. In some cases, thro ugh 
the action of monooxygenase, aromatic com-pounds may 
be converted into gentisic acid. The fission of this 
compound occurs between the hydroxyl and carboxyl 
groups, that is, meta fission. It has been shown in  some 
cases that chloroaromatic compounds such as 4-
chlorobenzoate, 4-chlorophenol and others may get 
dechlorinated during the hydroxylation resulting in t he 
formation of 4–hydroxy benzoates (4-HBA). This 4 HBA 
on further hydroxylation will be converted to proto- 
catechuate acid (3,4-dihydroxy benzoic acid), which may be  
cleaved either through ortho or meta mode.   
Several external factors can limit the rate of 
biodegradation of organic compounds. These factors may   
 
 
 
include temperature, pH, oxygen content and availabili ty, 
substrate concentration and physical properties of 
contaminants. Each of these factors should be optimize d 
for the selected organism for the maximum degradation  
of the organic compound of choice. The optimization of 
the substrate concentration in phenol biodegradation is 
particularly important since it inhibits the growth of  the 
organism at higher concentrations.  
Since civilization will most probably continue to be 
accompanied by the production of hazardous waste 
materials, it is necessary to develop efficient strat egies for 
waste management. Biotechnology for hazardous waste 
management involves the development of biological 
systems that catalyse the detoxification, degradation or  
decontamination of environmental pollutants. In futu re 
technologies, microbial systems might be the potentia l 
tools to deal with the environmental pollutants.
