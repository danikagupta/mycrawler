Because environmental problems are uncovered almost daily, this second edition has been created
to meet the challenge of solving them. Environmental engineering encompasses many areas. It
ranges from solid waste disposal, wastewater treatment, air pollution control, to life analysis.
Although there are many publications relative to the descriptions of concepts and methodologies inthe environmental control area, the actual calculations relative to the field seldom appear in thesepublications. In addition to the scarcity of environmental calculations thousands of environmentalregulations from federal, state, and local regulators impact environmental engineering design everyday. Just keeping abreast of such regulations is an enormous task for engineers. The main objective
of this book is, therefore, to provide step-by-step, practical calculational procedures on variousenvironmental subjects. More importantly, this book integrates the regulatory requirements into
environmental designs so the result can make these designs more acceptable to regulators. The
major subjects covered in the second edition include:
1.Calculations of water quality assessment and control
2.Solid waste treatment calculations
3.Air pollution control calculations
4.Air toxic risk assessment
5.Fuel cell technologies
A majority of the calculational examples provided in this book were developed by the authors
themselves and the materials were excerpted from previous USEPA publications. Since its creation
in 1970, the USEPA has published many environmental regulations and engineering reports. Many
very interesting calculational examples were scattered throughout these publications. The huge vol-ume of EPA regulations and reports makes a search for example calculations extremely difficult andtime consuming. To help resolve this difficulty, many of these examples were collected and edited ina format for readers to easily understand. The citing of references for each example calculation isprovided herein. This is to expeditiously assist users in locating additional information, if needed.
This book is intended to be a reference tool for those who are involved in the protection of
air, water, and land resources. It is believed that the book will make many environmental jobs much
easier. Lastly, the editor wishes to express his deep appreciation to the contributing authors who have
spent so many of their days and nights to make this book possible.

CALCULATIONS OF WATER
QUALITY ASSESSMENT
AND CONTROL
Part 1 of this book is written for use by the following readers: students taking coursework relating
to public water supply, waste-water engineering or stream sanitation, practicing environmental
(sanitary) engineers; regulatory officers responsible for the review and approval of engineeringproject proposals; operators, engineers, and managers of water and/or wastewater treatmentplants; and any other professionals, such as chemists and biologists, who have gained someknowledge of water/wastewater issues. This work will benefit all operators and managers of publicwater supply and of wastewater treatment plants, environmental design engineers, military envi-ronmental engineers, undergraduate and graduate students, regulatory officers, local public worksengineers, lake managers, and environmentalists.
The chapters in Part 1 present the basic principles and concepts relating to water/wastewater
engineering and provide illustrative examples of the subject. To the extent possible, examples relyon practical field data.  Each of the calculations provided herein are solved step-by-step in astreamlined manner that is intended to facilitate understanding. Calculations (step-by-step solu tions)
range from calculations commonly used by operators to more complicated calculations requiredfor research or design.
Advances and improvements in many fields are driven by competition or the need for increased
profits. It may be fair to say, however, that advances and improvements in environmental engineeringare driven instead by regulation. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets up maximum
contaminant levels, which research and project designs must reach as a goal. The step-by-step solution
examples provided in this book are informed by the integration of rules and regulations on everyaspect of waters and wastewaters. The author has performed an extensive survey of literature on sur face
and groundwaters encountered in environmental engineering and compiled them in the followingchapters. Rules and regulations are described as simply as possible, and practical examples are given.
The following chapters include calculations for basic science, surface waters ground water,
drinking water treatment, and wastewater engineering. Chapter 1.1 covers conversion factorsbetween the two measurement systems, the United States (US) customary system and the SystemInternational (SI), basic mathematics for water and wastewater plant operators, fundamentalchemistry and physics, and basic statistics for environmental engineers.Chapter 1.2 comprises calculations for river and stream waters. Stream sanitation had been stud-
ied for nearly 100 years. By the mid-twentieth century, theoretical and empirical models for assess-
ing waste assimilating capacity of streams were well developed. Dissolved oxygen and bioc hemical
oxygen demand in streams and rivers have been comprehensively illustrated in this chapter.
Apportionment of stream users and pragmatic approaches for stream dissolved oxygen models arealso covered. From the 1950s through the 1980s, researchers focused extensively on wastewatertreatment. In 1970s, rotating biological contactors also became a hot subject. Design criteria andexamples for all of these are included. Some treatment and management technologies are no longersuitable in the United States. However, they are still of some use in developing countries.
Chapter 1.3 is a compilation of adopted methods and documented research. In the early 1980s,
the USEPA published Guidelines for Diagnostic and Feasibility Study of Public Owned Lakes
(Clean Lakes Program, or CLP). This was intended to be used as a guideline for lake manage-
ment. CLP and its calculation (evaluation) methods are present in this chapter. Hydrological,nutrient, and sediment budgets are presented for reservoir and lake waters. Techniques for classifi-cation of lake water quality, assessment of the lake trophic state index, and of lake use support arepresented.
Calculations for groundwater are given in Chapter 1.4. They include groundwater hydrology,
flow in aquifers, pumping and its influence zone, setback zone, and soil remediation. Well setbackzone is regulated by the state EPA. Determinations of setback zones are also included in the book.
Well function for confined aquifers is presented in Appendix B.
Hydraulics for environmental engineering is included in Chapter 1.5. This chapter covers fluid
(water) properties and definitions; hydrostatics; fundamental concepts of water flow in pipes,weirs, orifices, and in open channel; and of flow measurements. Pipe networks for water supplydistribution systems and hydraulics for water and wastewater treatment plants are included.
Chapters 1.6 and 1.7 cover each unit process for drinking water and wastewater treatments,
respectively. The USEPA developed design criteria and guidelines for almost all unit processes.These two chapters depict the integration of regulations (or standards) into water and wastewaterdesign procedure. Water fluoridation and the CT values are incorporated in Chapter 1.6. Biosolids
are discussed in detail in Chapter 1.7. These two chapters are the heart Part 1, providing the theo-
retical considerations of unit processes, traditional (or empirical) design concepts, and integratedregulatory requirements.
Most calculations provided herein use U.S. Customary units. Readers who use the International
System (SI) may apply the conversion factors listed in Chapter 1.1. Answers are also generallygiven in SI for most of problems solved using U.S. units.
The current edition corrects certain computational, typographical, and grammatical errors
found in the previous edition. Drinking water quality standards, wastewater effluent standards,
and several new examples have also been added. The author also wishes to acknowledge Meiling
Lin, Heather Lin, Robert Greenlee, Luke Lin, Kevin Lin, Jau-hwan Tzeng, and Lucy Lin for theirassistance. Any reader suggestions and comments will be greatly appreciated.

1 CONVERSION FACTORS
The units most commonly used by water and wastewater professionals in the United States are based
on the complicated U.S. Customary System of Units. However, laboratory work is usually based on
the metric system due to the convenient relationship between milliliters (mL), cubic centimeters
(cm3), and grams (g). The International System of Units (SI) is used in all other countries. Factors
for converting U.S. units to the SI are given below (Table 1.1) to four significant figures.
