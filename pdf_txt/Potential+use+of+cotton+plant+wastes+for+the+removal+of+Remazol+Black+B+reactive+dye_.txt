Obstract
The release of industrial effluents into the environment causes widespread contamination of aquatic systems. Adsorption 
is seen as one of the most promising treatment processes, and lignocellulosic materials have gained prominence as 
adsorbents. This study investigates the potential of rice hulls, either in natura  or treated with nitric acid, as adsorbents for 
removal of the dye. The adsorbents were characterized by infrared spectroscopy, solid state 13C-NMR, thermogravimetric 
analysis, and pH at point of zero charge. The dye adsorption experiments were carried out in batch mode, using different 
experimental conditions. The kinetic adsorption data could be fitted using the model of Elovich. The Freundlich model 
provided the best fit to the isothermal data. The thermodynamic parameters confirmed the spontaneity of the adsorption 
process. These adsorbents offer an alternative for dye removal, with advantages including biomass availability and low cost.
Keywords:  adsorption, remazol, rice hull.
1. Introduction
The discharge of industrial effluents into the environment 
without adequate treatment is frequently a major problem, 
due to the problems of contamination of water resources. 
Many industries, such as those concerned with leather 
processing, rubber, paper, plastics, fabrics, and paints 
produce large volumes of wastewater containing various 
chemicals harmful to aquatic ecosystems[1-3]. Among these, 
in the absence of adequate wastewater treatment, textile 
manufacturers produce (during the dyeing step) effluent 
with persistent coloration, which can contaminate natural 
waters, interfering in the passage of solar radiation and 
impairing processes of photosynthesis[4,5].
Many processes are used in the treatment of wastewater 
containing dyes, such as biological oxidation and chemical 
adsorption[5-7], photoelectrochemical processes[8], treatment 
with zero-valent iron[9] and zero-valent iron/H2O2[10], 
heterogeneous photocatalysis combined with ozone 
treatment[11], hydrogen peroxide combined with UV[12], 
and others. However, many of these require appropriate 
conditions and have high operational costs. Adsorption has 
been shown to be very promising for the removal of textile 
dyes, since adsorbents can offer industrial practicality, low 
cost, high removal rates, and (in some cases) recovery of the 
species involved without losing their chemical identity[13].
Adsorption is the removal of a chemical species from 
the fluid phase, with subsequent concentration on the 
surface of a substrate, usually a solid[14]. Adsorbents are generally highly porous and have a large surface area[15]. 
One widely used material is activated carbon, which offers 
high efficiency due to its structural characteristics, high 
surface area, and chemical nature[3]. However, its use has 
some disadvantages, such as low selectivity and efficiency 
for certain disperse dyes[16], as well as losses during the 
recovery process[17], resulting in a need to identify less 
expensive and more effective adsorbents. There are a variety 
of alternative low-cost materials that can be used for the 
removal of textile dyes, and other contaminants. Agricultural 
residues are an abundant and inexpensive renewable source 
of potential adsorbents. Examples include babassu coconut 
shell[18], rice hull, rice straw[19,20 ], and banana pseudostem[21], 
amongst others. These agricultural residues can be used 
either in natura  or modified with the insertion or release of 
active sites capable of improving the adsorption efficiency.
Rice hull is an agricultural waste biomass produced by 
the rice processing industry. This bulky byproduct represents 
about 23% of the weight of the grain[22]. Few options for the 
use of this material have been reported in the literature, and 
it is still common to see deposits of the waste in the open 
and on the banks of rivers[23], where it takes about 5 years 
to decompose, while emitting a high volume of methane, 
a greenhouse gas that is also harmful to the ozone layer[24]. 
The aim of this study was therefore to analyze rice hull, 
in natura  and treated with nitric acid, as an adsorbent for 
the removal of Remazol brilliant violet textile dye present 
in aqueous solutions.Removal of Remazol brilliant violet textile dye by adsorption using rice hulls
Polímeros, 27(1), 16-26, 2017 17 2. Materials and Methods
2.1 Materials and reagents
The rice hull used in this work was collected in 
São Bento city (Maranhão-BR). All reagents used were of 
analytical grade. The Remazol brilliant violet textile dye was 
produced by DyStar and provided by Toalhas São Carlos 
(São Paulo-BR). The purity of the dye was not specified. 
The chemical structure of Remazol brilliant violet dye is 
shown in Figure 1[18].
2.2 Preparation of the adsorbent
The rice hull was ground and washed with distilled water 
in a ratio of 10:1 (v/w) for 30 min, with constant stirring, 
until the conductivity of the supernatant remained constant. 
The material was then dried at 333 K for 24 h and sieved to 
obtain the particle size range between 0.088 and 0.177 mm. 
This in natura  rice hull material was denoted RHI. Then, it 
was processed with acid, as described previously[25], with 
small changes in contact time and temperature. RHI was 
placed in a solution of 2 mol L-1 nitric acid, at a ratio of 
1:200 (w/v), at 323 ± 1 K, for 5 h under constant stirring. 
It was then washed with distilled water until the supernatant 
conductivity remained constant, dried at 333 K, and sieved to 
obtain the 0.088-0.177 mm particle size fraction. The treated 
rice hull was denoted RHT.
2.3 Characterization of the adsorbent
The adsorbents were characterized by Fourier transform 
infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), 13C nuclear magnetic resonance 
(13C-NMR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and pH 
at point of zero charge (pHpzc). The FTIR spectra in the 
4000-400 cm-1 region were obtained using an MB series 
spectrometer Bomem-Hartmann & Braun, and resolution 
of 4 cm-1.The KBr tablets were prepared using a press, by 
diluting the sample of interest in KBr at a ratio of 1:100 (w/w). 
The 13C-NMR spectra were obtained using a Bruker AC300 
spectrometer, with 7 mm rotor, cross polarization and 
magic angle spinning (CP-MAS), and a contact time of 
3 min. The repetition time was 3 s and the frequency was 
4 kHz. The TGA were performed with a DuPont instrument 
(model  9900), heating from room temperature to 1273.15 K 
at 10 K min-1, under an inert argon atmosphere. The pHpzc 
values of the adsorbents were estimated by placing 100 mg 
of the adsorbent (RHI or RHT) in contact with 25.0 mL of KCl solution (0.1 mol L-1), with initial pH (pHi) ranging 
from 1 to 12, previously adjusted with HCl or NaOH. After 
24 h of contact at room temperature and under constant 
agitation, the adsorbent was removed by filtration and the 
final pH (pHf) of the supernatant was measured.
2.4 pH study, adsorption kinetics and isotherms
The study was carried out varying the initial pH 
of the Remazol brilliant violet dye solution. 100 mg of 
adsorbent (RHI or RHT) was placed in contact with 25 ml 
of dye solution (100 mg L-1) for 24 h at 298 ± 1 K, under 
continuous stirring. This test was performed at six pH values 
(initial pH between 1 and 6, adjusted with HCl and NaOH). 
To obtain the adsorption kinetics, 100 mg of adsorbent 
was placed in contact with 25 mL of dye solution at two 
concentrations (100 and 1000 mg L-1), using the optimum 
pH (the pH at which greatest adsorption was observed in 
the pH study), with constant stirring at room temperature. 
The contact time was varied between 5 and 600 min. 
Adsorption isotherms were obtained by placing 100 mg of 
adsorbent in contact with 25 mL of dye solution at various 
concentrations (100 to 1000 mg L-1) and four temperatures 
(283, 298, 313, and 328 ± 1 K), using the optimum pH 
and stirring constantly during the equilibribration time. 
At the end of the contact time, the adsorbent was separated 
by centrifugation and the new dye concentration in the 
supernatant was determined with a UV -Vis spectrophotometer 
(model 2550, Shimadzu) fitted with a 1 cm optical path 
quartz cell, using the absorbance at 560 nm. The amount of 
adsorbed dye, q (mg g-1), was obtained using Equation 1[26],  
where Ci and Cf (mg L-1) are the initial and final dye 
concentrations, respectively, m (g) is the mass of adsorbent, 
and V (L) is the volume of dye solution.

3. Results and Discussion
3.1 Infrared spectroscopy
Spectroscopy in the infrared region is a widely practiced 
characterization technique, because it allows qualitative 
evaluation of the presence of different functional groups.

Figure 2. Infrared vibrational spectra of the RHI and RHT samples.Figure  2 illustrates the vibrational spectra of all the materials 
studied. The large numbers of peaks found for the in natura 
and treated rice hulls indicate the heterogeneous nature of 
the adsorbents.
The IR spectrum of the dye (see Figures 1 and 2a) 
presented many absorption peaks, including those 
corresponding to phenolic O–H, secondary amide N–H 
stretching, and aromatic C–H at 3671-3047 cm−1; aliphatic 
C–Hn at around 2925 cm−1; amide C=O stretching at 
1639 cm−1; C=C stretching at 1532 cm−1; N=N stretching at 
1436 cm−1; –SO (R–SO2–R) stretching at 1309 cm−1; –SO 
stretching of R–SO3- at 1207-989 cm−1; C–S stretching 
at 748 cm−1 (coupled with out-of-plane C–H and C=C 
bending) and at 626 cm−1[27,28 ]. The spectra for the adsorbents 
(Figures 2c and 2e) exhibited the characteristic bands of 
lignocellulosic materials reported in the literature[18,29-30 ], 
and did not differ in terms of the nature of the functional 
groups present. Broad stretching bands occurred between 
3100 and 3600 cm-1, indicating the presence of -OH groups 
on the surfaces of the matrices. These were mainly due to 
glycosidic structures, the presence of silanol groups (Si-OH), 
and water adsorbed on the surfaces of the hulls[31]. A band 
between 2900-3000 cm-1 corresponded to CH stretching 
of the methyl groups that are common in the structures of 
lignocellulosic materials. A band located at 1730 cm-1 was 
characteristic of stretching of C=O of ketones, aldehydes, 
and carboxylic acids. A band at 1640 cm-1 could be attributed 
to adsorbed water, while a band at 1500 cm-1 corresponded 
to aromatic C=C vibrations. A band at 1370 cm-1 was due to 
CH plane deformation vibration, and a band at 1240 cm-1 was 
associated with CO stretching of the pyran ring. A band at 
1060 cm-1 was due to the vibration of methoxyl (C-O-C) and 
β-1,4 bonds. Bands near 790 cm-1 were due to out-of-plane 
δ (CH) deformation of the aromatics present in lignin[32]. 
Comparison of the spectra for the in natura  and treated 
adsorbents showed that the intensities of the bands at 3435, 
1734, and 1067 cm-1 increased after treatment, as expected 
since these bands correspond to oxygen-containing groups 
(-OH, -C=O, and -COC-, respectively) that may have been 
formed during the treatment with nitric acid[33].3.2 Solid state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance
The solid state 13C-NMR spectra for the RHT and RHI 
matrices indicated the presence of structures of cellulose and 
its derivatives ( Figure 3). A peak at 105 ppm corresponded to 
the C1 carbon, with a large displacement due to the bonding 
to two oxygen atoms (CH(OR)2). Signals at 90 and 83 ppm 
referred to C4, with a smaller displacement than C1 since 
the bond involves only one oxygen (CH-OR)[34,35 ]. A peak at 
72 ppm was related to the C2, C3, and C5 secondary carbons 
attached to the hydroxyl (CH-OH). Peaks at 64 and 62 ppm 
were assigned to the C6 carbon, indicating regions of low 
crystallinity and amorphous character (see Figure  1A in the 
Appendix A)[36], confirming this characteristic for both matrices. 
The presence of methyl groups and carboxyl carbon-carbon 
double bonds were indicated at 21 and 172 ppm, respectively. 
A signal corresponding to lignin guaiacyl methoxy groups 
was found at 55 ppm, and signals corresponding to aromatic 
carbons could be seen between 120 and 150 ppm[37]. 
Comparison of the 13C-NMR spectra of the different 
matrices revealed increases in the peaks relating to C1, 
C2, C3, C4, and C5 after treatment (RHT sample) (see also 
Table 1A in the Appendix A). This could be attributed to 
the effectiveness of the treatment with nitric acid, forming 
active adsorption sites and increased intensities of peaks 
related to carbon atoms  with oxygen groups. These results 
corroborated those obtained in the characterization by infrared 
spectroscopy, which were also indicative of an increase in 
oxygen-containing groups after treatment.
3.3 Thermogravimetric analysis
Thermogravimetric analysis was used to determine the 
thermal stability of the adsorbents and provide quantitative data 
on mass loss according to temperature. The thermogravimetric 
(a) and derivative (b) curves obtained for the RHI and RHT 
adsorbents, under an inert argon atmosphere, are shown 
in Figure 4 .
The adsorbents showed similar behavior in terms of 
thermal decomposition, remaining stable up to about 473 K, 
as reported previously for other lignocellulosic materials[30]. 
Comparison of the percentage mass losses of the RHI 
and RHT adsorbents indicated that the in natura  matrix 
showed greater weight loss corresponding to cellulose and 
hemicellulose, while the treated matrix showed greater loss of

showed three distinct stages of decomposition. The first, at 
around 373 K, should not be taken into consideration in terms 
of thermal stability, because it was only due to the release 
of physically adsorbed water present on the surfaces of the 
adsorbents[38]. The second stage, between 473 and 623 K, 
resulted in a greater loss of mass, due to the decomposition 
of hemicellulose and most of the cellulose. In the third 
stage (623-1043 K), which showed less mass loss than the 
previous stage, there was decomposition of lignin, which is 
structurally more stable than cellulose or hemicellulose[32].
3.4 pHpzc and effect of pH
The pH at the point of zero charge (pHpzc) is a parameter 
that indicates the pH value at which a particular solid does 
not have excess net charges on its surface. This parameter 
is important because it enables prediction of the surface 
charge of the adsorbent as a function of pH, since at pH 
lower than the pHpzc, the surface charge of the solid is 
positive, while for pH values higher than the pHpzc, the 
surface charge is negative. Figure 5a shows a graph of the 
variation of ΔpH (pHi-pHf), as a function of the initial pH 
(pHi), for the in natura  and treated adsorbents.The pHpzc values obtained for the RHI and RHT 
adsorbents were 5.3 and 3.8, respectively. Hence, below 
these pH values, the surfaces of the adsorbents would be 
positively charged, favoring anion adsorption, while at 
higher values, the surfaces would be negatively charged, 
favoring the adsorption of cations. The pHpzc value for 
RHI was very close to values reported in the literature for 
in natura  rice hull (5.3)[19] and babassu coconut epicarp 
(6.7)[39,40 ]. In other work, it was found that in natura  wood 
sawdust had a pHpzc of 5.3, which decreased to 4.0 after 
treatment with hydrochloric acid[41]. The decrease in the 
pHpzc value of the adsorbent after treatment is an indication 
that there were changes in the surface characteristics, with 
an increased number of protonated sites. This is supported 
by the increased prevalence of peaks related to oxygenated 
groups in the infrared and 13C-NMR spectra.
The pH of the system is an important element in the 
adsorption process, because pH change alters the chemical 
balance of the ionic groups present in the adsorbent and the 
dye, influencing the electrostatic interaction. Figure  5b shows 
the removal percentages of Remazol brilliant violet dye by 
the RHT and RHI adsorbents. It can be seen that higher pH 
reduced adsorption of the dye, while at low pH there was 
greater protonation on the surfaces of the adsorbents, which 
favored anion removal.
The highest dye removal percentages were achieved 
at pH 1.0 and 2.0. At pH 1.0, the maximum amounts of 
dye adsorbed were 46.2 and 73.2% for RHI and RHT, 
respectively. Higher removal percentages of Remazol 
dyes at pH 1.0 and 2.0 were observed previously using 
adsorbents such as babassu coconut mesocarp[42] and rice 
hull[19]. Importantly, use of the RHT adsorbent significantly 
increased the percentage removal, compared to RHI, showing 
the effectiveness of the acid treatment. The adsorption by 
RHT improved between pH 3.0 and pH 6.0, suggesting 
that in addition to electrostatic attraction, other interaction 
mechanisms were involved in the adsorption process, since a 
decreased removal capability was expected between these pH 
values, as found for the RHI adsorbent. Another interesting 
finding concerned the contribution of protonation to dye

RHI and RHT, respectively. These results provided further 
evidence of the effectiveness of the treatment, which resulted 
in dye removal being practically independent of the effect 
of protonation, due to the enhancement of other interactions 
that contributed to the adsorption.
3.5 Adsorption kinetics
Study of the adsorption kinetics is important, because 
it provides information about the mechanism of adsorption. 
This work considered the contact time between the adsorbent 
and the adsorbate required for the system to reach equilibrium. 
The adsorption kinetics depends on several factors, including 
the adsorbent mass, concentration of adsorbate, temperature, 
pressure, and stirring speed of the system. Figure 6 shows 
the adsorption kinetics for two concentrations of the 
Remazol brilliant violet dye (100 and 1000 mg L-1) at pH 2 
(defined as optimal in the adsorption experiments), together 
with the fits obtained with the Lagergren (Equation 2)[43], Ho 
(Equation 3)[44], and Elovich (Equation 4)[45] kinetic models.

In the above equations, qe (mg g-1) is the amount adsorbed 
at equilibrium, k1 (min-1), k2 (g mg-1 min-1), and α (mg g-1 
min-1) are the Lagergren, Ho, and Elovich adsorption rate 
constants, and β (g mg-1) is a parameter related to the activation 
energy. The equilibrium times were 180 and 240 min for 
dye concentrations of 100 and 1000 mg L-1, respectively. 
At the lower concentration, the equilibrium time was shorter 
due to the smaller number of interactions between the dye 
molecules and the active sites of the adsorbent. Most of the 
adsorption occurred within 60 min, reflecting fast adsorption 
kinetics. The high adsorption rates in the early stages of 
the process were due to greater availability of active sites. 
Similar equilibrium times have been reported previously for 
the removal of Remazol dyes using lignocellulosic materials. 
Tunç et al.[46] used cotton stem bark to remove Remazol B 
black dye and obtained an equilibrium time of 300 min.
The values of the fitting parameters for the Lagergren, 
Elovich, and Ho kinetic models are shown in Table 1 . 
The closeness of R2 (coefficient of determination) to unity 
indicates the high levels of explanation provided by the 
models, with the best results obtained using the Elovich 
model. This model has been successfully used previously 
for adsorption by materials with heterogeneous surface 
energy, and allows for a gradual decrease in removal rate 
with increasing concentration[47]. The adsorbents used in 
this study presented several functional groups that could 
act as adsorption sites. Furthermore, Remazol brilliant 
violet dye also has many groups capable of interacting with 
adsorbents, so that the adsorption process was energetically 
heterogeneous, in agreement with the Elovich model.
3.6 Adsorption isotherms
After establishing the optimal pH and the equilibrium 
time, isotherms were constructed to determine the maximum 
amounts of dye that could be removed by the adsorbents. 
Figure 7 shows the dye adsorption isotherms for the RHI 
and RHT adsorbents, at four temperatures (283, 298, 
313, and 328 ± 1 K). The isotherms can be represented by 
mathematical equations used to provide information on 
the mechanism of adsorption, surface properties, and the 
affinity of the adsorbent for the adsorbate. Several models

Polímeros, 27(1), 16-26, 2017 21have been reported in the literature, and in this work, 
the experimental data were tested using the Freundlich 
(Equation 5)[48], Langmuir (Equation 6)[49], and Temkin 
(Equation 7)[50] models. The parameters of the models are 
given in Table 2 .

In the above equations, qm (mg g-1) is the maximum 
amount of dye adsorbed; KF (L mgn-1 g-n)1/n, KL (L mg-1), and 
KT (L mg-1) are constants of the Freundlich, Langmuir, and 
Temkin models, respectively; n is a parameter related to the 
energy of the surface sites; B (mg g-1) is a constant obtained 
from the expression B = RT/b, where b is a parameter related 
to the heat of adsorption, T is the absolute temperature 
(K), and R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J mol-1 K-1). 
The parameter, n describing the degree of heterogeneity of 
the system showed values between 1 and 5, which indicates 
favorable adsorption for both adsorption systems[51]. 
Application of the Freundlich model resulted in the highest 
value of the linear coefficient of determination (R2), with 
values close to unity for all temperatures studied Table 2 .Previous studies of lignocellulosic materials used for 
adsorption of Remazol brilliant violet have also found 
good fits using the Freundlich model. The materials tested 
were babassu coconut mesocarp[18], and coconut straw[52]. 
The amount of dye adsorbed increased progressively 
with increasing temperature, suggesting that the system 
was endothermic. This behavior could be explained by 
factors such as increased mobility of the molecules present 
in the solution (increased kinetic energy caused by the 
temperature rise), increased diffusion of adsorbate on 
the surface of the adsorbent, and dilation of the pores of 
the adsorbent[53].
3.7 Thermodynamics of adsorption
Knowledge of the adsorption thermodynamic parameters 
is important because it enables characterization of the 
process as spontaneous, exothermic, or endothermic, and 
provides information on the affinity of the adsorbent for 
the adsorbate. Additionally, these parameters can provide 
information concerning the heterogeneity of the surface of 
the adsorbent and whether the process involves physical 
or chemical adsorption. The thermodynamic parameters 
adsorption enthalpy (ΔH°), entropy (ΔS°), and Gibbs energy 
(ΔGº) were obtained by linearization of the van’t Hoff 
equation, according to Equations 8, 9, and 10[54].

In the above equations, qe is the amount adsorbed 
(mg g-1), qm is the maximum amount adsorbed at each 
temperature (mg g-1), Ceq is the equilibrium concentration 
of the adsorbate (mol L-1), T is the temperature of the 
adsorptive system (K), Keq are equilibrium constants, and 
R is the gas constant (8.314 J K-1 mol-1). Figure 8 illustrates 
the linearization of the experimental data according to the 
van’t Hoff equation, where linearity was observed between 
the points for the systems studied. The thermodynamic 
parameters for the adsorption of Remazol brilliant violet 
dye by the adsorbents are listed in Table 3 . Negative values 
of the Gibbs energy (ΔGº) indicated that the interactions 
between the dyes and the RHT and RHI adsorbents were 
spontaneous and favorable, because the lower the value of 
ΔG°, the greater the driving force of the process, resulting 
in high adsorption[53]. This was supported by the more 
negative values of ΔG° for RHT, which also showed greater 
adsorption of the dye, compared to RHI. Positive enthalpy 
(ΔHº) values indicated the endothermic nature of all the 
adsorption processes, with the amount of dye adsorbed at 
equilibrium tending to increase with increasing temperature. 
The positive entropy (ΔSº) values indicated that entropy 
increased during the adsorption process, so the process 
tended towards a higher degree of disorder.Bekçi et al.[55] reported that an enthalpy change of between 
0 and 20 kJ mol-1 was characteristic of a physisorption 
process, while a change of between 80 and 400 kJ mol-1 
reflected chemisorption. Alkan et al.[56] found that an enthalpy 
change of between 40 and 120 kJ mol-1 characterized a 
chemisorption process. However, Zhou et al.[57] considered 
that these ranges were not sufficient to confirm the type 
of adsorption. In fact, under favorable conditions, these 
processes can occur simultaneously or alternately[58], but 
the values obtained suggested that adsorption of the dye 
by the adsorbents occurred mainly due to physisorption.
3.8 Possible interactions between the dye and the 
adsorbents
Elucidation of the mechanism of dye adsorption is a 
major challenge, as many interactions can occur during the 
adsorption process. Remazol Brilliant Violet is an anionic 
dye that contains a sulfonic group in its structure (which 
ionizes in aqueous solution, forming colored anions), together 
with aromatic rings. The RHT and RHI adsorbents were 
lignocellulosic materials composed primarily of cellulose, 
hemicellulose, and lignin. Characterization of the adsorbents 
revealed heterogeneous surfaces and the presence of hydroxyl 
and carbonyl groups.
Comparison of the IR spectra for the dye and the rice 
hull surfaces ( Figures 2a, 2c, and 2e) revealed that they 
were very similar, with the exception of bands at 1639 cm-1 
(amide I) and 626 cm-1 (C–S stretching), which were only 
present in the dye spectrum. These bands were present in the 
spectra for the dye-saturated biomasses ( Figures 2b and 2d), 
indicating that adsorption had occurred. Unfortunately, the 
characteristic N=N stretching band of the dye was overlapped 
with the C–H deformation vibration band, and could not 
be used for comparative analysis[27]. No other new bands 
were present in the spectra for the materials with adsorbed 
dye, suggesting similar predominant functional groups 
after adsorption. This was in agreement with the better 
definition and intensity of the IR bands for the materials 
with adsorbed dye, as well as with the estimated values of 
the thermodynamic parameters (which were indicative of 
physisorption)[58]. Some of the well-defined bands, such as 
those at 1100-1300 cm-1, could be attributed to protonated 
sulfonic groups[27,59 ] that probably resulted from interactions 
between the dye and the protonated surface, as illustrated 
in Figure 9 .
The pHpzc values showed that at pH below 5.3 (RHI) 
and 3.8 (RHT), the surfaces of the adsorbents were positively

Polímeros, 27(1), 16-26, 2017 23charged, with the presence of H+ ions favoring adsorption 
of anionic species such as the dyes studied here. This was 
supported by the results obtained in the study of the influence 
of pH on the adsorption, with greater removal achieved at 
pH 1 and 2. These findings indicated that the mechanism 
of adsorption of the dye by the adsorbent occurred due to 
electrostatic attraction, with the adsorbents being protonated 
in an acid medium, hence attracting the negatively charged 
sulfonic groups of the dye.
The treated adsorbent showed greater dye removal 
efficiency, compared to the in natura  material, especially 
at less acidic pH (pH 3-6), where the percentage removal 
remained essentially constant. However, a smaller influence 
of protonation was observed for the treated adsorbent. These 
findings confirmed that in addition to electrostatic attraction, 
other interactions were involved in the adsorption systems 
studied. The FTIR results showed that carboxyl, hydroxyl, 
and aromatic carbon functional groups could participate in 
dye adsorption. Considering all the information obtained in 
the experiments, three possible interaction mechanisms[50,60 ] 
can be proposed for the adsorption of Remazol Brilliant 
Violet dye by the adsorbents at pH 2: (i) hydrogen bonding, 
(ii) electrostatic attraction, and (iii) π electron resonance 
(Figure 9 ).
4. Conclusions
The surface of rice hull was successfully modified 
by treatment with nitric acid, resulting in a decrease in 
the point of zero charge (pHpzc). Infrared and 13C-NMR 
analyses showed that oxygenated groups were introduced 
in the rice hull surface after treatment. Thermogravimetric 
analysis indicated that the matrix remained stable up to 
temperatures close to 473 K, and that the treated adsorbent 
showed greater weight loss due to the decomposition of 
lignin. The points of zero charge (pHpzc) were pH 5.3 and 
pH 3.8 for the in natura  and treated materials, respectively. 
Below the pHpcz, the surface was positively charged, 
favoring adsorption of the anionic dye.
Kinetic studies revealed that adsorption equilibrium 
was achieved within around 240 min. The Elovich kinetic 
model provided the best fit to the experimental data for 
adsorption of the dye, for the two concentrations employed here. The  adsorption isotherms obtained for different 
temperatures showed that the removal efficiency increased 
with increasing temperature. The Freundlich isotherm model 
provided the best explanation of the experimental results 
for adsorption of the dye. The thermodynamic parameters 
(ΔG°, ΔH°, and ΔS°) obtained for these adsorption systems 
(at the temperatures studied) revealed that the reactions were 
spontaneous, energetically favorable, and endothermic, with 
a high degree of disorder.
