Abstract . The combination of rapid urbanization and industrialization expansion increased waste 
volumes.  Most of the wastewaters gene rated from either domestic or industrial sources are still 
discharged  without adequate treatment processes, and impact  on the environment and public health. The 
objective of this paper was to provide a comprehensive literature review on the application of horizontal 
subsurface flow constructed wetlands in treating a variety of wastewaters, discussing  its feasibility in 
pollutant removal efficiency and additional benefit in climate change mitigation through  carbon 
sequestration . The following results were ob tained:  98%, 96%, 85%, 90%, 92%, 88% for BOD5, COD, 
TSS, TN, NH 4 –N, PO 43- respectively in Kenya; 98.46% and 98.55% for COD and BOD5 in Indonesia; 
and ranges from 94 -99.9%, 91.7 -97.9% and 99.99% for BOD5, COD and TFC respectively in Costa Rica. 
Whereas in Ethiopia, the HSSFCW achieved the following abatement efficiencies: COD ranges from 58  
to 80%, BOD ranges from 66 to 77%, TKN ranges from 46 -61%, sulfates ranges from 53 to 82%, and 
NH 4 – N range from 64 to 82.5% for tannery wastewater treatment. For domes tic wastewater treatment; 
99.3%, 89%, 855, 84.05%, 77.3%, 99% and 94.5% were achieved  for BOD5, COD, TSS, TN, PO 43-, TP, 
Sulfate, and TFC , respectively. In addition to improving water quality, CWs have a CSP. For example, 
CWs showed CO 2 equivalent of 4119. 54 g C/m2/yr CSP ( carbon sequestration potential) which is 
15118.7118  g CO 2. The methane equivalent to this amount of carbon sequestration is 604.748472  
g/m2/yr. Generally, research results indicated that constructed wetlands are efficient wastewater treat ment 
techniques and should be encouraged for wastewater management as a strategy to reduce wastewater 
pollution. However, constructed wetland performance efficiency sustainability is affected by the 
operational conditions of HSSFCW including plant species,  media/substrate types, water depth, hydraulic 
loading, and hydraulic retention time and feeding mode.

Introduction  
Globally, wetland ecosystems are more and more being used for the treatment and 
disposal of wastewater because they have been known as low -cost and operative 
treatment schemes (Brix  et al., 2001).  Their potential to advance the quality of water 
from inflow to outflow has been recognized ( Donald,  1989)  Constructed wetland 
schemes use a conglomerate of biological physical, and chemical  parameters . The 
combination of rapid urbanization and industrialization expansion increased waste Engida  et al.: Review paper on horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands: potential for their use in climate change mitigation

are discharged still without adequate treatment processes. The discharging of untreated 
or partially treated wastewater by cities and industries causes an impact on the 
environment and public health resulting in the contaminated downstream water supplies 
becoming unfit  for drinking, irrigation and recreational activities (Birhanu and Seyoum , 
2007), due to the presence of nutrients, heavy metals, toxic organi c pollutants and 
pathogens. Research reported by Bahri et al. (2008) also agreed that untreated 
wastewaters discharg ed into the freshwater bodies chang e the quality of freshwater. 
Besides deteriorating  the freshwater bodies, the farmland soil characteristi cs are also 
changed due to us ing contaminated river waters or direct use of wastewater for 
irrigation. According to Bayrau et al.  (2008) surveyed result s in the case of Ethiopia 
outbreaks of waterborne diseases in addition to eutrophication of surface wate r and 
farmland resources are common . 
The use of constructed wetlands for wastewater management is becoming more and 
more popular all over the world. This is due to its efficient wastewater management 
ability with cost -effective option in both developed and  developing countries.  Most of 
these systems are easy to operate, require low maintenance,  and have low investment 
cost (Ballesteros  et al., 2016;  Langergraber,  2013).  Today horizontal subsurface flow 
CWs (Constructed wetlands) are quite commonly used in m any developed countries 
such as Germany, UK, France, Denmark, Australia, Poland and Italy. Constructed 
wetlands are also appropriate for developing countries but they are rarely investigated 
and implemented (Prasad  et al., 2016).  Water body deterioration i s becoming a serious 
issue in developing countries due to indiscriminate discharge of wastewaters and lack of 
comprehensive management techniques . In developing countries  constructed wetlands 
(CWs) are used to treat a wide variety of wastewaters such as do mestic, municipal, 
industrial, landfill leachate as well as agricultural and highway runoff (Tilak et al., 
2016).  Wetland technologies are a reliable onsite  wastewater treatment technology  and 
work  with a higher rate of biological activity which enables co nversion of many of the 
pollutants that are contained in the wastewater into non -toxic byproducts and serve as 
secondary or ter tiary treatment level that meets  the regulatory standards. CWs have 
shown to successfully control macro (organic material, nutrie nts and pathogens) 
pollutants and provide high quality water used for irrigation, recreational and other 
reuse purposes. Generally, this technology serves as an active and low -cost alternative 
technology for the treatment of wastewater all over the world ( Mustafa, 2013).  
Treatment wetlands are technologies that are able to remove nutrients, toxic metals, 
organic pollutants, emerging contaminants and pathogenic organisms effectively 
(Belmont  et al., 2009; Chen  et al., 2012).  Their effective pollutant removal  is associated 
with several mechanisms involved in the constructed wetland systems.  These are 
sedimentation, filtration, volatilization, adsorption, plant uptake and bacterial activity 
(Chazarenc  et al., 2009; Ballesteros et al., 2016;  Langergraber, 2013).  The mechanisms of 
treatment in constructed wetland are complex process es which can happen simultaneously 
or sequentially involving microbial degradation, plant uptake, sorption, sedimentation, 
filtration and precipitation. In designing the good wetland, t he main biological component 
in the CW is aquatic plants  (macrophytes). However, it is important in determining the 
appropriate plant species that can survive in the wastewater environment, because only 
suitable plant species can treat a high concentration  of pollutant in the waste water 
(Prasad  et al., 2016). The selection of media type  is also very important, because clogging 
problems are observed in subsurface flow constructed wetlands and linked hydraulic Engida  et al.: Review paper on horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands: potential for their use in climate change mitigation 
and treatment of wastewater

media could decrease the estimated wetland area and improve the removal efficiencies 
(Lopez -Lopez  et al., 2015).  The vegetation biomass from the constructed wetlands can 
provide economic importance to communities by har vesting it for biogas production, 
animal feed, fiber for paper making and compost (Lakshman,  1987).  
They also have an important role in carbon sequestration (CS) and report s indicated 
that the highest CSP (carbon sequestration potential) was recorded for T ypha latifolia 
(741.02  g m-2/yr) followed by Phragmites australis (740.5  g m-2/yr) and the lowest for 
Carexsp (137.37  g m-2/yr) from wetlands (Maqubool  et al., 2013). Generally,  CW can 
provide economical on -site wastewater treatment that is both effective and aesthetically 
pleasing (El -Gohary,  2008),  and become a popular subject among  many community 
leaders, health officials, and home owners. However, in developing countries the use of 
CWs is certainly lower in comparison to their use in Europe or the Unite d States,  
despite the enormous potential and the great necessity of these countries to implement 
low-cost treatment for better wastewater management strategy to achieve the required 
standards (Belmont  et al., 2004; Zurita et al., 2006,  2008) . In order to e stablish the 
performance of constructed wetland systems under differ ent conditions various research 
studies  have been carried out to investigate constructed wetland systems in the removal 
of pathogens, organic matter and nutrients. To date however, very li mited research 
works on the performance of CW, especially under tropical conditions have been 
reported. Therefore, the purpose of this review paper was to provide a comprehensive 
literature review on the application of horizontal subsurface flow constructe d wetlands 
in treating a variety of wastewaters, and to discuss  its feasibility in pollutant removal 
efficiency and additional benefit in climate change mitigation through carbon 
sequestration.

© 2020, ALÖKI Kft ., Budapest, Hungary  Constructed wetland historical background  
Natural wetlands are usually found between water bodies and terrestrial areas. These 
systems naturally screen and collect pollutants such as silt and nutrients as they migrate 
towards water bodies. Natural wetlan ds were historically used as wastewater discharge 
sites (Kadlec,  2003).  This system is still used for wastewater treatment under controlled 
conditions and the use of constructed wetlands has increased significantly. The 
purposeful construction and study of  wetlands to treat wastewater was started at the 
Max Plank Institute in 1952 by Seidel (Vymazal,  2011).  
Research in this area has accelerated since 1985 because of the simplicity of the 
systems regarding  mechanical operation, biological complexity and high  level of 
treatment. The other attractive advantage for developing countries is that construction 
may be completed using local materials and labor. The first full scale horizontal flow 
constructed wetland was constructed and used in the Netherlands in the 1975 but 
vertical flow wetlands dated back to the time of Seidel (Kadlec, 2008).  Horizontal 
subsurface flow constructed wetland is the most widely used technology in Europe. This 
technology is designed typically in a rectangular bed form, and contains plan ted 
macrophytes and lined with an impermeable membrane or made from concrete. 
Mechanically raw or pretreated wastewater is fed in at the inlet and passes slowly 
through the filtration medium under the subsurface of the bed in a horizontal path until 
it reaches the  outlet zone before discharging via level control arrangement at the outlet 
(Vymazal, 2005).  
Constructed wetland classification  
General classifications  
Constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment are typically classified into two types 
according to the wetland hydrology , i.e. free water surface (FWS) constructed wetland 
and subsurface flow (SSF) constructed wetlands (Saeed and Sun, 2012).  
In the FWS system, the water flowing through the system is exposed to the 
atmosphere, while in the SSF system,  water is designed to flow through a granular 
media, without coming into contact with the atmosphere . FWS wetlands can be 
subdivided into four categories based on their dominant type of vegetation: emergent 
macrophyte, free floating macrophyte, free floati ng leaved macrophyte and submerged 
macrophyte. However, the subsurface flow wetlands  (which by definition must be 
planted with emergent macrophytes) can be sub -classified according to their flow 
patterns: horizontal or vertical (Vymazal and Kröpfelová, 200 8). 
Surface flow systems are further subdivided based on the type of macrophytes that 
grow on them as free floating macrophytes (e.g. duck weed and water hyacinth),  
submerged macrophytes, free floating leaved macrophytes and floating mat macrophytes. 
FWS s ystems are similar to natural wetlands,  with shallow flow of wastewater over 
saturated substrate.  Whereas, in SSF systems, wastewater flows horizontally or vertically 
through the substrate which supports the growth of plants, and based on the flow 
directio n, SSF constructed wetland is divided further into horizontal flow (HF) and 
vertical flow (VF) systems.  A combination of various wetland systems was also 
introduced for the treatment of wastewater, and this design generally consisted of two 
stages of sever al parallel constructed wetlands in series, such as VF -HF CWs, HF -VF 
CWs,  HF-FWS,  CWs,  and FWS -HF, CWs  (Vymazal,  2013). In addition, the multiple -Engida  et al.: Review paper on horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands: potential for their use in climate change mitigation

(Kadlec, 2008). In the rece nt years, enhanced artificial constructed wetlands such as 
artificial aerated CWs, baffled flow CWs, Hybrid towers CWs, step feeding CWs and 
circular flow corridor CWs have been proposed to enhance the performance of the system 
for wastewater treatment (Wu  et al., 2014). According to Haberl  (1999 ) design 
configurations of constructed wetlands are classified on the basis of the following 
parameters, as illustrated in Figure  1. 
 
 
Figure 1. Classification and types of constructed wetland systems. Performance evaluation of 
constructed wetlands  (Haberl,  1999)  
Performance evaluation of constructed wetlands  
Constructed wetlands are considered as natural treatment processes to stabilize, 
sequester, accumulate, degrade, metabolize and mineralize pollutants. They are  used for a 
wide range of wastewater treatment such as municipal, domestic, agricultural, industrial, 
acid mine drainage, petroleum refinery wastes, compost and landfill leachates, and storm 
wastewaters  (Vymazal, 2005). The treatment system involves macrop hytes, substrates 
and microorganism s able to improve the water quality for reuse purposes. Macrophytes 
and Medias are an active component of horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland 
(Vymazal, 2011). The selection of media type is also very important,  because clogging 
problems are observed in subsurface flow constructed wetlands and linked hydraulic 
retention time and hydraulic conductivity ( Lopez -Lopez et al., 2015 ). 
Wastewater treatment is accomplished through the integrated combination of 
physical, biological and chemical interactions among biotic and abiotic components of 
the ecosystem and macrophytes cultivated in constructed wetlands make one of the 
basic components in the treatment process.  
They influence plant microorganism ’s wastewater interact ions by providing microbial 
attachment sites, sufficient wastewater residence time, trapping and settlement of 
suspended wastewater components as a result of resistance to hydraulic flow, surface area 
for pollutant adsorption, uptake and storage in plant t issue and diffusion of oxygen from 
aerial parts to the rhizosphere (Kyambadde  et al., 2005). Wetlands remove metals using a Engida  et al.: Review paper on horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands: potential for their use in climate change mitigation

and hydrolysis, formation of carbonates, formation of insoluble sulfides, binding to iron 
and manganese oxides, reduction to immobile forms by bacterial activity, and uptake by 
plants and bacteria. Metal removal rates in both surface flow and subsurface flow 
wetlands can be high, but can vary gre atly depending upon the influent concentrations and 
the mass -loading rate (Vymazal, 2005).  
A study conducted in Kenya to assess the effectiveness of CW in treating domestic 
wastewater showed that the removal of BOD5, TSS, COD, TN, NH4 -N and 
Orthophosphate were highly effective with a removal value of 98%, 85%, 96%, 90%, 
92%, and 88%, respectively (Nyakango, 1999). This was mainly because this wetland 
consists of a combination of an SF system followed by three SSF wetland cells in a 
series adjacent to it. A case study conducted in Italy, to assess the treatment 
performance of an SSF CW by Pucci et al. (2000) showed high removal efficiencies for 
COD (93%), TSS (81%), hygienic parameters  (TC 99%, FC 99.7%), but relatively low 
for nitrate (55%), total nitrogen ( 50%)  and ammonium (30%), and very low for total 
phosphorus (20%). This is mainly due to poor nitrification and denitrification in the 
system. There is substantial evidence in the design of CW that a number of cells in 
series can consistently produce a high er quality effluent. Because this process 
minimizes the short -circuiting effects of any one unit and maximizes the contact area in 
the subsequent cell (Gearheart, 2004).  
Constructed wetland contaminant removal mechanisms  
Nitrogen removal mechanisms in wetl and are nitrification in aerobic zone, de -
nitrification in anaerobic zones which releas e N2 and N 2O gases, plant uptake, 
sedimentation, decomposition, ammonia volatilization, and accumulation of organic 
nitrogen in gravels because of redox potential of hyd ric sediment conditions ( Fig. 2). 
 
 
Figure 2 . Nitrogen removal processes in wetland (Vymazal and Kröpfelová, 2008)  
 
 
The fate of phosphorus is quite different in wetland soils, since there are  no 
mechanisms comparable to de -nitrification as phosphorus has  no gaseous phase. Engida  et al.: Review paper on horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands: potential for their use in climate change mitigation

then phosphorus tends to accumulate in wetlands. Precipitation of phosphate minerals 
can provide a significant sink for phosphorus in wetlands with larg e stores or inputs of 
iron and aluminum or calcium ( Fig. 3 ) (Vymazal and Kröpfelová, 2008) .

The wetland treatment mechanism  is a dynamic process acting wastewater 
purification unde r the cooperation of emergent macrophytes, substrates and attached 
microorganisms. In general, in constructed wetlands it is important to study biomass 
accumulation and nutrient flux in order to under stand the dynamics of nutrients. The 
carbon cycle in wetl ands has been investigated to understand the linkage between 
biomass generation and carbon sequestration (Kayranli  et al ., 2010). Wastewater 
treatment may also serve as a carbon sequestration offset (Rosso and  Stenstrom, 2008 ). 
Wetland ecosystems are actin g as a net carbon emission and sequestration systems  
depending on the time scale and hydrology operational strategies ( Whiting  et al., 2001), 
and as a component of a larger system treating wastewater  (Rosso and Stenstrom,  
2008). Constructed wetlands are pa ssive natural processes and avoid carbon emission 
equivalent of 1.3  Mt C/yr for every 1.0  MGD as compared to conventional high rate 
treatment facilities  such as activated sludge. There are many mechanisms for the capture 
and release of carbon in a wetland (Fig. 4). Pathways for the release of carbon in the 
constructed wetland system are slow decomposition, respiration, and physical removal. 
Photosynthesis is the process whereby a plant transforms atmospheric carbon in the 
form of CO 2 into the carbon of the plant tissue or biomass. The process of plant 
respiration releases some CO 2 to the atmosphere as a byproduct of cellular growth. In 
addition to respiration, plants release carbon as a byproduct of decomposition in the 
form of CO 2 and CH 4 (Burke, 2011).  
Factors affecting the performance of constructed wetlands  
Temperature  
This is a key environmental factor that determines the activity of nitrifying bacteria 
and the de -nitrification potential in treatment wetlands ( Langergraber, 2013 ). Nitrogen 
removal by bio logical means is most efficient at 20 -25 °C and temperatures above this Engida  et al.: Review paper on horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands: potential for their use in climate change mitigation

microbial nitrification and de -nitrification activities can decrease considerably at water 
temperatures below 15 °C or above 30  °C, and most microbial communities for nitrogen 
removal function at temperatures greater than 15  °C (Kuschk et al., 2003). Literature 
revealed that the activity of de - nitrifying bacteria in constructed wetland sediments is 
generally more robust in spring and summer than in autumn and winter and the overall 
removal rate of nitrate is higher in the summer than in winter (Oostrom, 1994). De -
nitrification is commonly believed to cease at temperatures below 15  °C, but some stu dies 
have demonstrated de -nitrification activity at 14 °C or lower temperatures. Richardson et 
al. (2004) reported that the optimum temperature range for nitrification is 30 -40 °C in 
soils and the optimal ammonification is carried out at 40 -60 °C at the op timal pH between 
6.5 and 8.5. At low temperature, nitrification is insufficient to prevent a net increase in 
ammonia concentration due to ammonification (Akratos and Tsihrintzis, 2007).

HRT  
The high purifica tion efficiency of constructed wetlands can be achieved by choosing 
suitable growth media. Particle size, surface nature, bulk porosity and pore spaces of the 
growth media are important factors in selection of media type for wastewater treatment. 
Growth me dia provide not only physical support for plant growth but also additional 
sites for biofilm growth and the adsorption of nutrients, heavy metals and promote the 
sedimentation and filtration of pollutants. In general, the inconsistent treatment 
efficiency of constructed wetlands depends on the type of feeding mode, the plant types 
and type of media used (Abdelhakeem et al., 2016). According to Huang et al. (2000) 
explanation, ammonium and total Kjeldhal Nitrogen (TKN) concentrations in treated 
effluent decr eased diagrammatically with increased wastewater retention time.  In most Engida  et al.: Review paper on horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands: potential for their use in climate change mitigation

with organic  matter (COD and BOD) removal efficiency. Accordingly, nitrogen 
removal efficiency vari es greatly with flow conditions and HRT (Taylor et al., 2006).  
In subsurface constructed wetlands, media perform the function of rooting material 
for macrophytes surface for microbial biofilm growth, screen organic and inorganic 
suspended matter, and distr ibute inflow and collect outflow water (U.S. EPA, 1993). 
Keeping the water level below the surface of the bed, this reduces the risk of human 
contact with pathogens, and reduces the opportunities for breeding vector organisms 
such as mosquitoes. Media can also provide adsorption sites for phosphorus (Kadlec, 
2003).  According to this researcher , potentially active industrial byproduct substrates 
include blast furnace slag, crushed rock, fly ash, and crushed concrete, burnt oil shale, 
iron ochre and wood chip s. The microorganisms responsible for the degradation of 
pollutants are located at the surface of the media and the smaller sized media has a 
larger surface area than the coarser media (Vymazal and Kröpfelová, 2008).  
Well graded media (containing all grave l sizes in the selected range) is better than 
poorly graded media as it offers greater pore space and provides good removal of 
particulate matter. In general, the substrate alone also provides significant wastewater 
treatment, but vegetation further improv es treatment efficiency (Abdelhakeem et al., 
2016). Therefore, the high purification efficiency of constructed wetlands can be 
achieved by choosing suitable growth media.  
 
Types of plant species  
Plants are  often  grow n in gravel beds to stimulate uptake and  create suitable conditions 
for the oxidation of the substrate, thereby improving the ability of the system to treat the 
wastewater and create aesthetic value, exhibit several properties which enhance 
wastewater treatment processes and thus, make them an e ssential component of the 
treatment wetland. These properties influence wastewater treatment through physical 
effects such as filtration, provision of surface area for the growth and attachment of 
microorganisms and regulati on of undesirable water temperat ure as well as surplus algal 
growth. Macrophytes are the main biological component of wetlands and their presence 
has been hypothesized to play a key role in wastewater remediation (Luckeydoo et al., 
2002). Macrophytes are also play an important role in wa stewater treatment through 
uptake of nutrients, surface bed stabilization and other mechanisms (Kadlec,  2008). 
Wetland plants must survive the potentially toxic effects of the effluent and enhance the 
treatment process of wetlands in several ways such as filtering wastes, regulating  flow, 
providing  surface area for mi crobiological treatment, providing  shed and control ling algae 
growth, contri buting  oxygen to the cells,  taking  up and storing  some metals and nutrients 
from the wastewater (Kyambadde et al., 2005). 
Metabolically, plants take up pollutants; produce organic carbon and oxygen, thereby 
improv e the water to varying extents. They are not only assimilating pollutants directly 
into their tissues, but also act as catalyst s for purification reactions by i ncreasing the 
environmental diversity in the rhizosphere, promoting a variety of chemical and 
biological reactions that enhance purification. Several studies have shown that plants 
enhance treatment efficiency by providing a favorable environment for the d evelopment 
of microbial populations and by oxygenating the system. The roots of macrophytes 
provide surface areas for microbial growth and aerobic zones in constructed wetlands. 
The root facilitates various physical and biochemical processes caused by the relationship 
of plants, microbial communities, soil and contaminants. Wetland systems with Engida  et al.: Review paper on horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands: potential for their use in climate change mitigation

(Taylor et al., 2006). Nutrient removal by the emergent plants is achieved b y two 
processes: absorption of the plant itself and microorganism activity around the rhizome 
(Cooper and Boon,  1987). In general, the main role of macrophytes in constructed 
wetlands is to promote microbial growth with the media surfaces, and to assist th e 
permeation velocity of the wastewater for pollutant treatment efficiency  (Table  1).

Other important factors are wetland depth, pH, and DO. The nitrification and 
denitrification process depend upon water pH, the presence or depletion of dissolved oxygen, 
hydraulic loading rate, and the hydrological period of the wetland. At low DO conc entration, 
nitrification occurs in the aerobic zone but denitrification occurs in the anoxic zone (Kadlec,  
2008). The biofilm may improve the denitrification; because of algae provide a desirable 
carbon source for denitrifies (Mariñelarena and Di Giorgi, 2 001). In general, in order to 
maintain and improve nitrogen removal and water quality in constructed wetlands, attention 
should be given to factors that promote the growth rate of macrophytes and bacteria , such as 
planting depth, harvesting time, optimizat ion of temperature, pH, DO and HRT.  
Performance efficiency of horizontal sub surface flow constructed wetland

This section presents different macrophytes used for treatment of wastewater in

each case study is according to parameters related to the overall constructed wetland

direct discharg e into a water course ( Tousignant and Fankhauser, 1999 ). These systems  
are highly effective at improving water quality have many benefits such as habitat 
creation and low-cost operations ( Kadlec, 2008 ). According to Mustafa  (2013 ), the 
monitoring of horizo ntal flow constructed wetland indicates that the general performance 
of the system was good and it successfully reduced pollutants even under fluctuating 
pollutant loading resulting from power breakdown. The average reduction of BOD 
concentration over the treatment periods was 50% with mean effluent concentration of 34  
mg/L.  Whereas,  the average removal efficiency of the treatment system for COD, TSS, 
ammonia –nitrogen, orthophosphate and fecal coliform were 44%, 78%, 49%, 52% and 
98% with mean effluent conc entrations of 68.3 mg/L, 45  mg/L, 9.7  mg/L, 3.7  mg/L and 
3.0 x 103 CFU  (Colony -forming units)/100  ml respectively.  
In general, the monitoring of horizontal flow constructed wetland indicates that it 
was good and successful in reducing pollutants from waste water up to the required 
standards even under fluctuating pollutant loading. The outcomes revealed that if 
constructed wetlands are properly planned and operated, they can be used as secondary 
or tertiary treatment level under local conditions and finally delivers high value water 
that can be  used for landscape irrigation and also for other helpful uses. The COD 
removal efficiency of HSSFCW even at low concentration which might be due to high 
degradation rate in the wastewater collection systems and in sett ling tank before 
entering the CWs. In overall, the result s obtained in Indonesia, Thailand, and Costa Rica 
revealed that, the local macrophytes and local natural substrates can perform 
successfully  in the treatment of domestic wastewater ( Table 2). The org anic 
contaminants and pathogens can be removed successfully, therefore, the treated water 
can be used safely for irrigation, fishery or out -door uses. In addition, the treated water 
can replace a part of the fresh water need supplied from the pipe distribu tion systems 
and be potential to protect surface and ground water reduces from the pollutants. 
Moreover, the use of macrophyte creates a green space in a single house yard or green 
public views for neighborhood  (Qomariyah  et al., 2017) .

© 2020, ALÖKI Kft ., Budapest, Hungary  The performance efficiency of subsurface flow constructed wetland in Italy done by 
Pucci et al. (2000) indicates that it has high removal efficiency for COD (93%), TSS 
(81%) and total coliform (99%), but relatively less removal for nitrates (55%), total 
nitrogen (50%), ammonium (30%) and total phosphorus (20%). This is mainly due to 
poor nitrification and denitrification in the treatment system. A study done in Kenya 
also revealed that the effectivenes s of the constructed wetland in treating domestic 
wastewater and indicated a removal efficiency of 98%, 85%, 96%, 90%, 92% and 88% 
for BOD5, TSS, COD, TN, NH 4–N and PO 4 respectively (Nyakango, 1999). This 
achievement was due to the wetland design which con sists of a combination of a surface 
flow system followed by three subsurface flow wetlands in a series adjacent to it.  
The removal efficiency of constructed wetlands varies with hydraulic retention time, 
hydraulic loading, wetland design, temperature, subs trate and vegetation. Although 
considerable number of reports has contributed to our understanding of the physical, 
chemical and biological processes that facilitate the removal process, inconsistence 
results suggest that further studies are required to op timize the system functioning. For 
example, many scholars show that, a wetland scheme with vegetation has advanced 
efficiency of removal than that without plants (Bwire  et al., 2011) although others did 
not notice any significant change between planted and  unplanted systems (Baldizon  et 
al., 2002). Similarly, the percentage s of nutrient  (nitrates/nitrites and phosphates) 
removal obtained in the planted constructed wetland cell were higher than the averaged 
percentage s of nutrient  removal rates in the unplan ted cell.  
Thus, the average nitrate/nitrite percentage removal was 58.1% for planted cells 
and 21.6% for unplanted cell while the phosphate percentage removal averaged 40.1% 
for planted cells and 5.2% for unplanted cell  (Mairi et al., 2012 ). Bacteria may b e 
reduced by sedimentation, chemical reactions, natural die -off and predation by 
zooplankton, nematodes, lytic bacteria and attacks by bacteriophages (Denny,  1997). 
The role of plants related  to the treatment of wastewater is the physical effects brought 
about by the presence of the plants.  The macrophytes alleviate the surface of the beds, 
offer good condition for physical filtration and deliver enormous surface area for 
attached microbial growth (Brix and Schierup,  1989). Furthermore, macrophytes 
reduce t he velocity of wastewater into the wetland system and also supply oxygen at 
the root zone which is used by aerobic microbes, thereby enhancing purification 
process of wastewater in addition to purification done by anaerobic microbes (Watson  
et al., 1989).  
The performance efficiency of different constructed wetland systems that contain  
different HRT, substrate, plant species and wastewater type were reviewed in order to 
regulate the performance of constructed wetland parts in elimination of contaminants. 
The influent and effluent concentrations including percentage removal were 
summarized in Table 3 .

system design, environmental ch emistry (roots, plants, water and sediments), plant 
uptake, available carbon and material type. The mean removal efficiency of the planted

The mean influent concentration of COD,  TSS, NH4 –N, NO3 –N and PO4 –P in 
January were  144, 54, 96, 2.76 and 3.62  mg/L , respectively. The effluent concentrations 
after treating with constructed wetland were 64, 8, 62,  1.69 and 3.55  mg/L , respectively. 
The mean pe rcentage removal reductions for COD, TSS, NH4 –N, NO3 –N and PO4 –P 
in this month were 55%, 85%, 35%, 39% and 2% , respectively. The mean influent 
concentrations of these pollutants in February were 192, 38, 63, 2.91 and 4.12  mg/L , 
respectively. The mean efflu ent concentrations were 64,  4, 28, 2.33 and 1.05  mg/L , 
respectively. The mean percentage removal efficiency of the wetland was reached 66%, 
89%, 55%, 20%, and 75% for COD, TSS, NH4 –N, NO3 –N and PO4 –P, respectively. In 
hydrologic comparison in the construct ed wetland indicated that the COD,  TSS, NH4 –
N, NO3 –N and PO4 -P reductions were considerably greater in February compared to 
January. This was due to the lower HLR and greater HRT in February compared to 
January. The major mechanisms of TSS and COD removals  in constructed wetlands are 
sedimentation, filtration and physical entrapment in the void pores of the sand and 
gravel medias. The higher HRT also allows for greater physical settling of suspended 
particles, which reduces the TSS and the higher residence time allows wetland plants to 
uptake nutrients effectively  thereby decreasing the effluent concentrations (Tilak  et al., 
2016).  The nitrogen content of Pistia stratiotes, Typha latifolia and Lemon grass in the 
subsurface flow constructed wetland were 37.4  g/kg, 27.1  g/kg and 15.8  g/kg, 
respectively.  
The phosphorus accumulation capacity of these plant species were also 8.4  g/kg, 
2.96 g/kg and 2.29  g/kg, respectively for Pistia stratiotes, Typha latifolia and Lemon 
grass in the constructed wetland ( Fig. 6) (T ilak et al., 2016). Subsurface flow 
constructed wetlands are good in utilizing pollutants in a symbio tic relation between 
aquatic plants and microorganisms in the media and the plant root system. Composite 
organic compounds confined in wastewater will be u sed up by plants as a nutrient, 
while the root structure of the aquatic plants will yield oxygen that can be used as 
energy or catalyst for a sequence of metabolic courses for heterotrophic aerobic 
microorganisms. Plant s that are usually used include  Cyper us alternifolus, Canna indica, Engida  et al.: Review paper on horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands: potential for their use in climate change mitigation

© 2020, ALÖKI Kft ., Budapest, Hungary  The effect of vegetation on the organic matter removal was better than (i.e., 5 to 
15%) those of the unplanted. In general, the organic removal results suggest  that control 
treatment influences wetland performance more than the type of macrophytes. The TSS 
removal efficiencies varied from 35 to 76% in both dry and nortes  season. The organic 
matter (COD and BOD) removal showed similar pattern to that of TSS, whic h was 
varied from 36 to 68% and 28 to 69% for COD and BOD , respective ly in the dry 
season, and where as for the nortes season, they varied from 40 to 78% for COD and 49 
to 74% for BOD. The nutrient removal efficiencies ranged from 47 to 66% and 59 to 
79% fo r TN, 53 to 67% and 50 to 75% for NH 4 + and 69 to 84% and 60 to 75% for 
NO 3- respectively for dry and nortes seasons.  In general, the performance efficiency of 
the horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland in organic matter, nutrient and 
pathogens were shown in Figures  8 and 9. The overall result clearly indicates that HRT 
is a key factor in the removal of a wide variety of contaminants (COD, BOD, TSS, TN, 
NH 4 + NO 3 - and TP) in horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland treating swine 
wastewater.  According to the findings, the Typha latifolia and Eleocharis interstincta 
are the most suitable macrophyte species to be used for the treatment of piggery 
wastewater.  In spite of the fact that high contaminant concentrations in wastewater may 
have masked the macrophytes; contributing to the overall treatment efficiency of 
HSSFCW, vegetated beds usually provide better effluent quality than unplanted beds  
(Puigagut  et al., 2007 ). 
The above graph indicates that the local macrophytes and natural substrate can 
perform successfully in the treatment of domestic wastewater. The results demonstrated 
that removals of organics (COD and BOD) are high in the horizontal subsurface flow 
constructed wetlands. The treatment efficiency of BOD nan COD ranged between 76 
and 99 .4% and 76 and 8.46% , respectively except COD removal studied result s in 
Thailand which varied between 42 and 83%.

Performance efficiency of HSSFCW: a case in Ethiopia  
In Ethiopia, environmental degradation within and downstream of cities has 
multiple consequences for public health, in particula r through the use of untreated 
wastewater in irrigated agriculture. Significant wastewater treatment efforts are done 
by Addis Ababa Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (AAWSSA),  but it remained 
limited. Due to the combination of poor sanitation and undula ting topography,  almost 
all wastewaters generated in the city finds its way through a dense network of streams 
into Akaki Rivers (Little and Great Akaki rivers).  Several factories also discharge 
their untreated effluents into the rivers. Wastewater collect ion and treatment are 
limited and treated wastewater is also discharged into the same river.  Discharges from  
industry, domestic, and agricultures  can cause an impact on environmental condition 
in river and coastal waters. Eutrophication is an accelerated g rowth of algae on higher 
forms of plant life caused by the enrichment of water by nutrients,  especially 
compounds of nitrogen and/or phosphorus and inducing an undesirable disturbance to 
the balance of organisms present in the water and to the quality of t he water 
concerned.  Eutrophication of fresh water ecosystem is one of the most prevalent 
environmental problems responsible for water quality degradation on a world -wide 
scale. At present hardly any infrastructure is available  for the effective treatment o f 
sewage in developing countries.  
Municipal sewerage and the extent of domestic and industrial wastewater treatment 
are inadequate in most urban situations.  When there is a municipal sewerage network 
in place, the coverage is usually incomplete and the tre atment level is insufficient. 
Even when treatment facilities exist, poor maintenance and operation often results in 
failing treatment processes, causing pollution of the effluent receiving surface waters.  
The risk of water borne diseases may actually incre ase in developing countries as a 
result of the introduction of a conventional sewerage scheme, since it is usually not 
accompanied by effective end -of-pipe treatment (UNEP/GPA, 2004).  Untreated 
effluent contains high concentrations of salts, total suspende d solids, chemical oxygen Engida  et al.: Review paper on horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands: potential for their use in climate change mitigation

chlorinated organic compounds. Industrial effluents can seep into the aquifer and 
pollute groundwater or where it is discharged without proper treatmen t can affect the 
physico -chemical properties of the receiving water and consequently its biota 
(Kambole, 2003).  
All this unregulated discharge of wastewater undermines biological diversity, natural 
resilience and has a significant impact on macro -invertebr ates composition due to the 
water quality deterioration (Beyene  et al., 2009). Addis Ababa City Rivers are highly 
affected by pollution of heavy metals, pathogens, organic compounds,  synthetic 
chemicals, micro -plastics and nutrients (Aregawi, 2014). Study reports indicated that 
the city water bodies and surrounding agricultural soils are contaminated with heavy 
metals such as Hg, As, Pb, Sb, Ni, Sr, and Cd (Elias and Yohannes,  2017),  which are 
extremely toxic even at low concentrations and cause  gastrointes tinal, skin, nerve 
damag e, lung damage, cancer, nervous, immune system, and kidney damage, brain 
damage, liver damage, and etc.  (Kassa, 2012). Beside these,  water, soil and air pollution 
due to industrial and domestic wa ste discharges cause  peculiar diseas es. Study and 
literature report showed that most people found in Akaki Kality industrial zone are 
affected by peculiar diseases such as cough (76.5%), diarrhea (58.8%), typhoid (51%), 
typhus (45.1%), gastrointestinal (3 9.2%), skin problem (29.4%), a sthma ( 33.3%), and 
bronchitis (3.9%) (Aregawi, 2014; Elias and Yohannes,  2017). This may be due to long 
term intake of food that contains high levels of heavy metals and pathogens, and  contact 
with sediments containing  heavy metals and pathogens, posing risks to human health 
(Itanna,  2002; Bekele, 2008) To protect water bodies from  pollution, serious waste 
management implementation should be conducted. The main challenge mentioned by 
researchers is selecting the appropriate wastewater treatment techniques.  Therefo re, 
locally available effective pollution control systems are very important based on the 
country ’s economy. For this problem, constructed wetlands can be a good alternative 
options.  
In Ethiopia, Terfie and Asfaw (2004) conducted a research  on five pilot s cale 
subsurface flows constructed wetlands; four units vegetated with Cyprus altenifolius, 
Typha domingensis, Phragmites karka and Borassus aethiopum and the fifth left as

matter (COD & BOD5), a mmonium and total nitrogen including total chromium 
under the 5 -day hydraulic retention time and hydraulic loading of 120  L/day showed 
promising results. The wastewater analysis indicated that COD reduction by 58 -80% 
for an inlet orga nic loading rate (OLR) ranged from 2202 -8100  mg/L and BOD5 
reduction by 66 -77% for an inlet OLR ranged from 650 -1950  mg/L. The removal of

nitrogen ranged  from 30 -57%, 82 -92.4%, 53 -82%, 46 -61% and 64 -82.5% , 
respectively ( Table 5). Similarly, Kassa and Mengistou (2014) tested pilot scale 
HSSFCWs efficiency in treating domestic  wastewater in vegetated and un vegetated 
conditions at HLR and HRT of 7  day and 26  L/day HLR. The results showed that the 
nutrient removal efficiency of HSSFCW was significantly higher in the planted 
species tha n in the  unplanted treatment system. The average removal efficiency of 
orthophosphate in the treatment beds was 84.05% for C.  papyrus , 65.29% for  P. 
Karaka and 50.20% for the unplanted. She proved that the average removal efficiency 
of planted cells was higher than unplanted due to the macrophytes role to accumulate 
high biomass and remove nutrients.  Engida  et al.: Review paper on horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands: potential for their use in climate change mitigation

Jehovah Witnesses Branch Office (JWBO) full scale HSSFCW performance was 
evaluated by Birhanu (2007) and the result showed average removal efficiency of the 
constructed wetl and system for BOD5, COD, TSS, ammonium, n itrate, total nitrogen, 
orthophosphate, total phosphorus, sulfate, sulfide and total coliform was 99.3%, 89%, 
85%, 28.1%, 64%, 61.5%, 28%, 22.7%, 77.3%, 99% and 94.5% , respectively. The 
individual cells removal efficiency indicated that the wetland planted with Cyprus 
papyrus showed  higher removal efficiency for nitrate (82.4%), ammonium (24.8%), 
total nitrogen (54.8%), orthophosphate (23.5%), and total suspended solids (83.9%) as 
compared to the other wetland systems. In the same regard, wetland cells planted with 
Phoenix canariensi s showed higher removal efficiency for total phosphorus (17%), 
sulfide (99%), BOD5 (98%), COD (90%) and total coliform (94%). Whereas, the other 
wetland cells planted with Cyprus alternifolia showed higher removal efficiency only 
for sulfate ion (82.2%). T he performance efficiency results indicated that, this wetland 
system has excellent removal capability for BOD5, COD, TSS, sulfate, sulfide and total 
coliform bacteria. However, since the HRT of the constructed wetland system (2.16 Engida  et al.: Review paper on horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands: potential for their use in climate change mitigation 
and treatment of wastewater

© 2020, ALÖKI Kft ., Budapest, Hungary  days), the nutrient (nit rogen and phosphorus) removal efficiency was low. The organic 
matter removal efficiency of JWBO CW investigated by Brhanu (2007) was similar to 
that of the study done in the USA: i.e., BOD5 (93%) (USEPA, 1993); in Kenya: BOD5 
(98%), COD (96%) and TSS (85%)  (Nyakango, 1999); in Northern Alabama: BOD5 
(85%) (Kathleen, 2000); and in Italy: COD (93%) and TSS (81%) (Pucci, 2000). The 
higher removal of the planted treatment beds may be due to a combined biochemical 
reaction mechanism favored by plants, substrates  and microorganisms. The most 
important effects of the macrophytes in relation to the wastewater treatment processes 
are the physical effects of the plant tissues that give rise to filtration effect and provide 
surface area for attached microorganisms. In addition to this, the media and 
macrophytes roots in SSF may provide a greater number of small surfaces, p ores, and 
crevices which create  the opportunity for the availability of a vast number of organic 
matter utilizing microorganisms adapted to the aerobi c and anaerobic environment of 
wetland ecosystems which facilitate the organic matter removal process of CW more 
effective ly (USEPA, 1993 ; Michael, 2006 ). On the other hand, the effectiveness may be 
associated with the presence of easily biodegradable orga nic matters in domestic 
wastewater by biological decomposition process within a short HRT ( Reddy, 1991 ). 
According to Ayano’ (2013) demonstration on the performance efficiency of horizontal 
subsurface flow constructed wetland at deferent depth with the sam e media type (gravel, 
8-16 mm), wetland area and different hydraulic loading rate of 18 L/m2/day and 
36 L/m2/day for depths 25 cm and 50 cm in planted and unplanted conditions, showed  
no significant difference in removal of pollutants at the same HLR. The removal of 
BOD5 and TSS were not different between planted and unplanted beds. However, areal 
and volumetric rates for planted beds were significantly greater than the unplanted beds 
for TKN. Unplanted beds may be more anaerobic than planted beds to favor reducing 
bacteria. Garcia et al. (2004) reported that the removal of HSSFCW increased with 
decreasing depth and attributed high oxidation reduction potential which is responsible 
for increasing nitrification. The result showed that constructed wetlands are  successful 
in removal of nutrients from domestic wastewater.  
Heavy metal removal efficiency of HSSFCW  
The toxicity nature of most heavy metals  
Recently there has been an increase in the river pollution trend in Addis Ababa and 
other cities, due  to the dis charge of untreated wastewater from  the industries and 
municipal wastes. Constructed wetlands have a good potential for the removal of heavy 
metals from wastewater (Sahu, 2014). According to Sahu report, the horizontal 
subsurface flow constructed wetland r educed the concentration of Hg, Cr, Fe and Ni 
from the initial concentrations by 43%, 54%, 46% and 49% , respectively. The potential 
heavy metal remediation of HSSFCW planted with Phragmites australis was 
investigated by Bahre (2013) and achieved high remov al efficiency of 99.33%, 93.67%, 
89.24%, 96.14% and 98.33% , respectively for Fe, Mn, Pb, Cu and Zn at hydraulic 
loading rate of 22  L d-1 and hydraulic retention time of 28th days. In the same regard, 
the unplanted unit showed removal efficiency of 98.43%, 91.66%, 85.01%, 90.70% and 
85.19% for Fe, Mn, Pb, Cu and Zn , respectively at the same conditions.  The result 
indicates that uptake on roots for Pb and Cu was higher than the uptakes by plant leaves 
and stems. The soil media heavy metals accumulation also s howed the highest 
adsorption capacity for the analyzed heavy metals from the planted and control systems.  Engida  et al.: Review paper on horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands: potential for their use in climate change mitigation

© 2020, ALÖKI Kft ., Budapest, Hungary  This demonstrates that horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland planted with 
Phragmites australis and red ash gravel can remove heavy metals fro m leachat e. 
This result is  similar to the reported metal removal efficiency of subsurface flow 
constructed planted with S globulosus and E. sexangulare in treating leachates, which 
were 81.33% and 94.19% , respectively for Cu and Pb; while 86.91% and 95.88%  
removal in E. sexangular , respectively for Cu and Pb (Mohamed and  Baskar,  2018). 
This finding also agrees with the result of Refidah (2002) who reported the removal 
efficiency of surface flow constructed planted with S. sumantresisana in treating 
leachate ; which was 89%, 90% and 89% , respectively for Fe, Zn and Mn. The analysis 
of result s showed that  up to 99.3%  of chromium was reduced from  tannery wastewater 
for an inlet average Cr loading rate of 40  mg/L (Amenu, 2015) . Similar values were  
reported by  Terfie and Assfaw  (2014) of total chromium in HSSFCW beds. The plant 
parts analysis on the accumulation of chromium showed similar results, more Cr was 
accumulated in root parts of the plants than in the shoot. This indicates that constructed 
wetland is a cos t effective and environmentally friendly treatment method in removal of 
not only organic maters, nutrients and pathogens, but also heavy metals, and hence it 
can be used as an alternative treatment method for developing countries  (Table 6 ).

Heavy metals in plant tissue s and substrate media  
The probable recognized biological processes for metal removal in wetlands are plant 
uptake and adsorption on the substrate media. The Pb and Cu uptake ability of P. australis 
by its roots may be due to the localized properties of the  root, mainly predominated 
rhizofiltration mechanisms to accumulate heavy metals (Zhu  et al., 1999). Similarly,  
Kadlec and Wallace  (2009 ) reported that plants can accumulate higher concentrations of 
metals in their roots. This may be due to the slow mobili ty of metal transport from the 
root to shoot. In the same case, substrate media is also one of the important factors for the 
removal of heavy metals. Figure s 10 and 11 indicate the role  of substrate media for Pb 
and Cu removal from leachate. However, the r etention time and the type of media have an 
effect on the treatment of wetland (Knox  et al., 2004). Since media provides a viable Engida  et al.: Review paper on horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands: potential for their use in climate change mitigation

including sedimentation, adsorption, prec ipitation and microbial interaction (USEPA, 
1993).  In general,  the control HSSFCW showed the higher removal efficiency of Pb and 
Cu than the planted wetland. Similar finding was observed in the removal of chromium 
from tannery wastewater (Terfie and Assfaw , 2014).  This may be due to chemical 
precipitation and sorption of metals on substrate media.

Terfie and Assfaw (2014) investigation data indicates clearly the fate of total 
chromium in the horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland ( Fig. 12a). Whereas 
Kassa and Mengistou (2014) investigated data on the fate of total phosphorus is under 
question mark, where the fate of TP is in a constructed wetland ( Fig. 12b). 
However, the removal  efficiency of heavy metals is dependent on the HRT, flow rate 
(Q) and pH. Sahu (2014) determined the effect of HR T on the reduction of different 
heavy metals . The treatment efficiency was observed increased as HRT increases from 
1 to 7 days  at a flow rate of 8  cm3/min (Fig. 13). As Fig. 13 showed the maximum 
removal of 54%, 49%, 46% and 43% were obtained respectively  for Cr, Ni, Fe and Hg 
at 7 days HRT. The effect of HRT on the removal of heavy metals was also determined 
by Bahre (2013) and presented in Figure  14.

Factors affecting the performance efficiency of constructed wetlands  
Vege tation and HRT  
The TSS removal efficiency of planted and unplanted constructed wetland at different 
HRT was significantly different. The initial TSS concentration was 106 mg/L. Some 
while  after treatment under CW were  reduced to 35.4 and 19.7 mg/L at 2 and  4 days HRT 
with a removal efficiency of 66.7% and 81.5% , respectively in the vegetated one. 
Whereas, for the unplanted CW, TSS were reduced to 62.3 and 49.8 mg/L for 2 and 4 
days HRT with total removal efficiency of 41.5% and 53.2% , respectively. The plan ted 
CW had higher results in TSS removal than the unplanted one ( Fig. 15). Increase of HRT 
resulted in better TSS removal efficiency even for the non -vegetated CW. The efficiency 
of BOD5 removal was 52% and 73.4% at HRT of 2 and 4 days in the planted beds.  
Cons tructed wetland without plantation removed only 20 -35% BOD5 from the influent.  
Constructed wetland planted with Canna indica L. gave higher BOD 5 removal 
efficiency than non-vegetat ed CW. The BOD5 removal also increased at higher HRT 
(i.e., almost half  BOD5  removed at 4  days HRT) than shorter HRT (i.e.  2 days HRT).  
TKN removal in the vegetat ed CW also gave the maximum removal efficiency compared  
to the non -vegetated CW. This removal efficiency of TKN may be associated with 
addition of plant activity. CW  planted with Canna indica L.  removed TKN for 45.3% for 
2 days HRT and 69.6% for 4 days HRT. TKN removal efficiency had increas ed at 
increasing HRT (Panrare  et al., 2015). This TKN removal of the CW technique may be 
due to volatilization, plant uptake and bacte rial assimilation (Vymazal, 2007).  The 
vegetated CW at 4HRT also gave the highest phosphate removal efficiency (77.7%). This 
phosphate removal in CW could be normally by plant and bacterial uptake, adsorption at 
the media and sedimentation.  The effect  of vegetation and HRT on the performance 
efficiency of constructed wetland is indicated in Figure 15. Engida  et al.: Review paper on horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands: potential for their use in climate change mitigation 
and treatment of wastewater

Media type  
The level of permeability and hydraulic conductivity of the media is very influenti al 
on the retention time of wastewater, in which the retention time is enough to give a 
chance to contact between microorganisms in wastewater and oxygen released by plant 
roots. The main function of the media in the constructed wetland is to provide place s for 
plants to grow , microbial attachment for pollutant t ransformation process , and nutrient 
absorption  (Dadan, 2016). The performance of subsurface flow constructed wetland 
based treatment  can be shown in Table 8.  
 
Microorganisms  
Preferably heter otrophic  aerobic microorganisms are present  due to faster processing 
ability than anaerobic types. The oxygen content in the media will be supplied by plant 
roots, which is a byproduct of the process of photosynthesis of plants with the help of 
sunlight (Dadan et al., 2016).

Constructed wetland as climate change mitigation  
Constructed wetlands are increasingly widespread for wastewater treatment in 
small commun ities and households where in addition to the fundamental purifying 
function, they also have decorative function that imposes the choice of plants 
characterized by high functional, amenity, and aesthetic values (Ghermandi  et al., 
2010).  Constructed w etland s carbon cycles contribute to the global greenhouse gases 
(GHGs) balance through their CO 2 and CH 4 emissions. In particular, they can act as 
CO 2 sinks by photosynthetic CO 2 assimilation from the atmosphere or as a source of 
CO 2 through bed respiratio n (Bar bera et al., 2009) and organic matter decomposition 
(Brix  et al., 2001). The rate of carbon decomposition in constructed wetlands depends 
on the redox chemistry of the soil, the bioavailability of organic carbon and 
temperature. For example, in summe r seas on, oxygen diffusion to the topsoil can 
reduce methanogenesis and stimulate methane oxidation  (Grünfeld and Brix, 1999). 
However, an increase in temperature can decrease dissolved oxygen in deeper subsoil 
and enhance methane production. All biochemic al rea ctions increase  as temperature 
increases C and N turnover in constructed wetlands causing high variations in GHG 
emissions in different regions . Due to t his more data and investigation are needed on  
constructed wetland types for better extrapolation of GHG  emissions. Hence, 
organizing more information  on nutrient removal efficiency and GHG emissions 
across CW in different CW types is necessary for better management. Emissions of 
GHG in CWs can vary across CW types, e.g., surface flow or subsurface flo w (Tables 
9 and 10). 
Generally, methane emissions are higher in surface flow CWs (SFCWs) than 
subsurface flow constructed wetlands ( Table 9), but may vary with season. Nitrous 
oxide and carbon dioxide emissions are higher in VSSFCWs than in HSSFCWs and 
SFCWs. Aq uatic plants play an important role in GHG production and transport to the 
atmosphere by releasing GHG through their interconnected internal gas lacunas . 
Emergent plants can transport atmospheric oxygen to the rooting zone and contribute 
to increase the N 2O and CO 2 production and methane consumption (Brix, 1989). 
Release of low molecular weight organic matter that is labile in nature is more likely 
to produce GHGs than stable forms. A fluctuating water table in CWs has significant 
impacts on GHG dynam ics (M ander, 2011) . In aerobic and anaerobic conditions, 
incomplete nitrification and denitrification increase N 2O emissions (Healy et al., 
2007). In general, assessment of GHG emissions in various types of CWs which are 
vegetated or unvegetated  is necessa ry in the light of the national and global GHG budgets.  Engida  et al.: Review paper on horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands: potential for their use in climate change mitigation

Even if constructed wetlands are contributors of GHG, on the other hand, constructed 
wetlands present an impor tant opportunity for carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas 
offsets by virtue of their potential for restoration using known and innovative land 
management methods.  Because  constructed wetlands are inherently  highly productive and 
accumulate large below -ground  stocks of organic carbon. Wetlands are major carbon 
sinks. While vegetation traps atmospheric carbon dioxide in wetlands and other 
ecosystems alike, the net -sink of wetlands is attributed to low decomposition rates in 
anaerobic zones. Recently, const ructe d wetlands used for wastewater treatment and Engida  et al.: Review paper on horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands: potential for their use in climate change mitigation

enhancing carbon sequestration (Kanungo et al., 2017). The percentage of organic carbon 
(OC%) content of the 15 emergent ma croph ytes varied between 34.97 to 50.92, 34.98 to 
52.04, 34.96 to 52.01 and 34.91 to 50.94. similarly, biomass (g/m 2) ranged from 104 to 
687, 16 to 1382, 141 to  1493 and 122 to 635. The carbon sequestration potential (CSP) 
was determined by multiplying th e OC in per gram of dry weight to the biomass of that 
species (Wang et al., 2011) and the total CSP of all the emergent macrophytes was 
obtained by the summation of individual CSP of all species. Based on this calculation, the 
highest CSP was recorded for Typha  latifolia followed by Phragmites australis and the 
lowest for Carexsp. ( Fig. 16) which exhibited from the highest carbon content of 53.62% 
which was greater than the 44% value reported by Wang et al. (2011) for Typha 
orientalis.

Wang also reported 44.7%, 44.1% and 41.8% of carbon for Phragmites communis, 
Cyprus malaccensis, and Eleocharis dulcis , respectively which is lower than the values 
of Phr agmit es australis, Cyperus difformis, and Eleocharis palustris , respectively 
obtained by Khan and Maqubool (2014). These macrophytes species carbon content and 
hence their CSP was higher when compared with other reported results for Scirpus 
lacustris (44.1 2%), Eleocharis palustris (43%) (Fernández -Aláez et al., 1999); 
Phragmites australis (29.2%) and Myriophyllum salsugineum (15.8%) (Piola et al.,

Polygonumspectable (38%). Assuming 4119.54  gC/m2/yr as the rate of carbon 
sequestered in each year in this system, the limit for carbon emissions can be calculated 
to determine the point at which the syst em of fsets carbon emission. To compare the 
physical sequestration and the gaseous emissions both are converted to carbon dioxide 
equivalents (CO 2e) (Forster et al., 2007). The CO 2e allows the comparison of different 
masses and gases as they relate to their  greenhouse warming potential. Methane has 25 
times the potential as CO 2. Each gram of carbon is equivalent to 3.67  g of CO 2. The 
CO 2 equivalent of 4119.54  gC/m2/yr. is 15118.7118  g CO 2. The methane equivalent to 
this amount of carbon sequestration is 604. 74847 2 g/m2/yr. C onstructed wetlands 
show ing methane emission values less than 1,600  kg/ha/yr are considered as potential 
for carbon sequestration (Kayranli et al., 2010). Based on this argue, the above 
treatment plant has a carbon sequestration potential.  
Cons tructed wetlands are purposely constructed in order to reduce input of nutrients 
and organic pollutants to water bodies. When these systems are used for wastewater 
treatment, microbial processes and gas dynamics are likely to be altered. With increase d 
inputs of nutrients and organic pollutants, there is an increase in greenhouse gases 
production due to decomposition processes. Constructed wetlands therefore, can be 
sources of important greenhouse gases. The average CH 4, N 2O and CO 2 fluxes for 
surface flow constructed wetland were 2.9, 1.05, and 15.2  mg/m2/h, respectively. 
Where as the average higher fluxes were  found from free water surface constructed 
wetland with average CH 4, N2O and CO 2 fluxes at 5.9,  1.8, and 29.6  mg/m2/h, 
respectively, correspondin g to the average global warming potential (GWP) of 392  mg 
CO 2 equivalents/m2/h and 698  mg CO 2 equivalents/m2/h, respectively for SSFCW and 
FWSCW ( Fig. 17) (Chuersuwan et al., 2014).

Conclusion  
The reviewed results showed that the HSSFCWs perform g ood r emoval ef ficiencies 
for organic matter and SS under low C ∶N∶P loading conditions. Nowa days,  the 
strategies of treating domestic and municipal wastewaters by decentralized way become 
common in rural and urban areas using constructed wetland technologie s. Besides this, 
constructed wetlands are accepted as a reliable wastewater technology as post treatment 
of effluents. Because  they are low cost, easily operated and maintained and have a 
strong prospective for application in developing countries.  
Most res earch  investigation results revealed that use of a subsurface horizontal flow 
phytoremediation treatment system is a promising natural technology in the treatment of 
municipal or industrial wastewater. Because, CW treatment system was found to comply  
with WHO ( 1989) standards for treated effluent reuse. Globally, the following abatement 
efficiencies were achieved by HSSFCW treatment system: 98%, 96%, 85%, 90%, 92%, 
88% for BOD5,  COD,  TSS,  TN, NH 4–N, PO 43-, respectively in Kenya; 98.46% and 
98.55% for COD an d BOD 5 in Indonesia; and ranges from 94 -99.9%, 91.7 -97.9% and 
99.99% for BOD 5, COD and TFC , respectively in Costa Rica. Whereas in Ethiopia, the 
HSSFCW achieved the following abatement efficiencies: COD ranges from 58  to 80%, 
BOD ranges from 66  to 77%, TKN  ranges from 46  to 61%, sulfates ranges from 53  to Engida  et al.: Review paper on horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands: potential for their use in climate change mitigation

domestic wastewater treatment;  99.3%,  89%,  855, 84.05%,  77.3%,  99% and  94.5% were  
determined  for BOD5,  COD, TSS, TN, PO 43-TP, Su lfate, and TFC , respectively.  
The pollutant removal ef ficiencies and greenhouse gas emissions from the CWs 
increased with the rise in temperature. The HSSF CWs had the highest tendency to emit 
CH 4 and thus global warming potential of CWs, and the combined CWs b y way of 
contrast showed low global warming potential. Due to the climate demonstrative of CW 
and periodic changes, further study to observe the seasonal fluctuations of CH 4 and N 2O 
emission is necessary. CWs have been found to be potential sinks of C arbon  in terms of 
organic carbon. We face several significant questions regarding the potential for carbon 
sequestration in wetlands. Constructed wetlands can be managed as net carbon sinks over 
time. From the Reviewed results point of view, the net carbon  gain and the biomass was 
comparatively higher,  carbon storage in biomass and reduced CO 2 emissions.  For 
example, the City of Arcata sequesters carbon in all three treatment units at a rate 
equivalent of 80,000  kg CO 2/yr. Most research investigation result s rev ealed that 
horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland s have been successfully employed to 
abate key contaminants from wastewater and able to meet the required standard discharge 
limits.  
However, constructed wetland performance efficiency sustainab ility is affected by the 
operational conditions of HSSFCW including plant species, media/substrate types, water 
depth, hydraulic loading, and hydraulic retention time and feeding mode.  Though the 
Total Carbon value at the CW is particularly beneficial for the g rowth of emergent 
macrophyte. CWs can be used to treat the wastewater from an industry or community 
development and also provide an additional benefit as green belts around the industries or 
the community development. By adopting these Biological CW t reatm ent systems, we 
can not only achieve our plan of carbon emission reduction but also generate huge amount 
of savings and earn carbon credits too to ensure a Clean Development Mechanism.  
Recommendations  
In this paper, encouraging reviewed results were o btain ed on the role of HSSF CWs on 
the performance of climate mitigation and wastewater t reatment. Based on this review , 
recommendations for the educational community and user of the technology are 
suggested . In order to obtain refined results for further long-term research on the 
performance of the wetlands with respect to all parameters using advanced sized wetland 
is essential. Besides, further analysis of carbon sequest ration potential for climate 
mitigation and nitrification potential using the HSSF co nstru cted wetlands is 
recommended for better results. For the user of the technology it can be chosen for 
application and their construction cost is evidently cheaper. However, evapotranspiration 
was peak and overstated during dry seasons in planted beds . Furth ermore; it is worthwhile 
to use HSSFCW as one part of the treatment system to reduce GHG emission effect and 
infection before applying wastewater to recycle in irrigation.
