1. Introduction

mental issues. Indeed water is an essential resource neededin most human activities. Protecting water quality requiresearly warning systems for on line and in situ pollution mon-itoring.
Phosphorus is needed for microphyte growth of which it
is often the limiting factor. Some microphyte species cansurvive under strongly deﬁcient phosphorous conditions.These micro-organisms can indeed stock large amounts ofphosphorous. Phosphatase enzymes can hydrolyse phos-phate containing molecules in this purpose. Depending onthe species and the pH, different types of phosphatases canbe found namely alkaline, acid and neutral phosphatases.

E-mail address: chovelon@univ-lyon1.fr (J.-M. Chovelon).Recently, research concerning biosensors has led to the
development of enzyme sensors using immobilised singleenzymes( Dzadevychetal.,1994;Shul’Gaetal.,1994;Wan
et al., 1999; Dennisson and Turner, 1995; Turner et al.,1987). These sensors have been tested successfully for the
detection of toxic compounds in environmental controls aswell as food and medicine analysis.
Enzyme-based sensors are highly selective systems for
the detection of toxic compounds because of their highspeciﬁcity of groups of inhibitors towards a particular en-zyme. For instance, alkaline phosphatase activity (APA) isknown to be mainly inhibited by heavy metal ions. Fromthis statement, developing a multi-enzymatic biosensor willallow the detection of different groups of pollutants by thesame device ( Arkhypova et al., 2001 ). However, immo-
bilising different enzymes on a multisensor arrays is notso easy, because all enzymes must be working under thesame operational conditions simultaneously. Several prob-lems namely the enzyme stability, their high price must beovercome.

The use of micro-organisms for multi-enzymatic biosen-
sor design can be a good solution, each algal cell contain-ing a large number of enzymes. Moreover using a livingorganismgivesinformationconcerningtheecotoxicologicaleffects of pollutants on these organisms.
This paper describes the development of a conduc-
tometric biosensor using immobilised whole cell algae,Chlorella vulgaris , for APA analysis and heavy metal de-
tection (for example, cadmium ions). Using whole cellalgae is very interesting since these cells are the primaryproducers of aquatic food webs ( Khoshmanesh et al.,
1996): any disturbances may have consequences on the
upper levels. Bioassays have already been developed forthe detection of C. vulgaris alkaline phosphatase activ-
ity and the inﬂuence of heavy metal ions ( Durrieu et al.,
2003).
Some enzymatic reactions involve either consumption or
productionofchargedspeciesand,therefore,leadtoaglobalchange in the ionic composition of the tested sample thatcan be detected with conductometric biosensors. These sen-sors present a number of advantages (a) thin-ﬁlm electrodeare suitable for miniaturisation and large-scale productionusing inexpensive technology; (b) they do not require anyreference electrode; (c) transducers are not light sensitive;(d) the driving voltage can be sufﬁciently low to decreasesigniﬁcantly the power consumption and (e) large spectrumof compounds of different nature can be determined on thebasis of various reactions and mechanisms, but this can alsobe considered as a disadvantage since it lowers the selectiv-ity of the sensor.
The ﬁrst steps in the development of these biosensors
are presented in this paper such as the possibility to followAPA analysis with conductometric biosensors as well asthe ﬁrst optimisations and toxicity assays. These results arecompared with measurements by bioassays.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
TheC. vulgaris strain (CCAP 211/12) was purchased
from the culture collection of algae and protozoa at Cum-bria, UK. The axenic algal strain was grown in the culturemedium and under conditions described by the Interna-tional Organisation for Standardisation (ISO, 8692, 1989).The APA measurements require a 21-day-long starvationperiod in the culture medium without phosphate ( Fitzgerald
and Nelson, 1966 ). The concentration in algae cultures was
≈3×10
7to 5×107cells/ml.
Bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 25% aqueous so-
lution of glutaraldehyde (GA) were purchased fromSigma–Aldrich. Calcium alginate and CaCl
2was purchased
from Fluka.
Two substrates were used to determine alkaline phos-
phatase activity: methylumbellifery phosphate (MUP)and paranitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) from Sigma–
Aldrich.
Cd(NO 3)2salt (of analytical grade) was used to inacti-
vate alkaline phosphatase activity. All other reagents wereof analytical grade.
2.2. Sensor design
TheconductometrictransducerswerefabricatedattheIn-
stitute of Chemo- and Bio-sensorics (Munster, Germany)(Trebbe et al., 2001 ). Two pairs of Pt (150nm thick) inter-
digitated electrodes were made by the lift-off process on thepyrex glass substrate. The Ti intermediate layer of a 50-nmthick was used to improve adhesion of Pt to substrate. Cen-tral part of the sensor chip was passivated by Si
3N4layer
to deﬁne the electrodes working area. Both the digits widthand interdigital distance were 10 /H9262m, and their length was
about 1mm. Thus, the sensitive part of each electrode wasabout 1mm
2.
Measurementsbasedonthedetectionofsolutionconduc-
tance variations inside membrane. Alkaline phosphatase, asmany other enzymes, induces catalytic reactions consumingand producing different ionic species resulting in measur-able conductivity changes.
2.3. Algae immobilisation
Previous studies have shown that pure enzymes can
be immobilised on electrodes using bovine serum albu-min and glutaraldehyde as a crosslinker ( Zhylyak et al.,
1995; Dzyadevych et al., 2002 ). Moreover Babu and Panda
(1991)have also used a similar technique to immobilise
Escherichia coli cells. This is why this technique has been
tested in this study. On the other hand, as literature reportson the use of calcium alginate beads for algae immobili-sation, the latter has also been tested ( Dainty et al., 1986;
Bozeman et al., 1989 ).
2.3.1. BSA membranes
The active membrane deposited on the sensitive area of
theelectrodewasformedbycross-linkingalgaewithbovineserum albumin in saturated GA vapours. This protocol wasadaptedfrompureenzymemembranesusedwithsomecon-ductometric and ISFET biosensors ( Dzadevych et al., 1994;
Shul’Ga et al., 1994 ).
Two mixtures were prepared. The ﬁrst one contained
100/H9262l algae solution and 10% (w/v) BSA was deposited
on one of the electrode’s sensitive surfaces using a dropmethod. The second mixture contained 100 /H9262l heated algae
(at 90
◦C for 15min; Dainty et al., 1986 ) and 10% (w/v)
BSA was deposited on the electrode reference surface.Measurements for heated algae by bioassays show that heatinhibits the APA (unpublished results).
Finally, sensors were placed in saturated GA vapours.
After exposure, membranes were dried at room temperaturefrom 15 to 30min.C. Chouteau et al./Biosensors and Bioelectronics 19 (2004) 1089–1096 1091

were conducted in Tris–HCl buffer (pH 8.5, 10mM for biosensors and 100mM for bioassays) and 1mM MgCl 2.
2.3.2. Calcium alginate membranes
To improve adhesion a drop of K 2Cr2O7/H2SO4so-
lution was deposited on the sensitive areas of the trans-ducers for 10min and washed afterwards with distilledwater.
Two mixtures were prepared. The ﬁrst mixture was pre-
pared by allowing 100 /H9262l algae solution to be mixed with
5% (w/v) calcium alginate. The second mixture was pre-pared with heated algae and 5% (w/v) calcium alginate andused for reference.
A ﬁrst layer of the different mixtures was deposited on
each sensitive area. Biosensors were placed in the fridge for30min. After drying, a second layer was dropped and im-mediatelyafter,biosensorswereimmersedinCaCl
2(0.1M)
for 8min to cross-link membranes.

2.4.1. APAs measurements
For biosensors, measurements were carried out in day-
light at room temperature in a 5ml glass cell ﬁlled with aTris–HCl buffer (10mM, pH 8.5) and MgCl
2(1mM) solu-
tion.Biosensorswereimmersedinavigorouslystirredsam-ple solution.
Note: Concentration of Tris–HCl buffer is 10 times smaller
than for bioassays because of the high conductivity of thissolutionthatwouldcreateanimportanthighbackgroundsig-nal. Moreover, the small concentration used did not disturbthe pH of the solution.
After stabilisation of the output signal, different aliquots
of stock solution of substrates (MUP (2mM) or pNPP1092 C. Chouteau et al./Biosensors and Bioelectronics 19 (2004) 1089–1096
(43mM)) were added into the vessel. The differential out-
put signal was registered using a ‘home made’ conducto-metric laboratory apparatus ( Patskovsky and Volotovsky,
1996) and the responses of the biosensor were recorded as
a function of substrate concentration.
For bioassays, measurements were based on ﬂuores-
cence detected by a spectroﬂuorimeter (Fluostar, BMG).The enzymatic reaction using MUP (2mM) as a sub-strate gives a ﬂuorescent product, the MUF (methy-lumbelliferone), that can be easily detected using anoptic ﬁbre at an excitation and emission wavelengths of365 and 460nm, respectively ( Durrieu and Tran Minh,
2002).
The pNPP substrate gives a coloured product that can be
detected using colorimetry. Moreover, as it has been shownthat the MUP susbtrate gives a larger and quicker signal. Asa result, the MUP substrate has been chosen for bioassays(Lubian et al., 1992 ).

the pNPP substrate response caused by short ( ≈1min) and
long exposures to Cd
2+solutions (concentrations from 0.1
to 10ppm) was used to estimate the enzyme inhibition.
Bioassays were carried out in 48-well plates. The APA
inhibition could be estimated using the decrease of ﬂuo-rescence of the MUF product for algae exposed to Cd
2+
solutions (concentrations from 0.1 to 10ppm) from 0 to
4h.

2.5. Storage
Biosensors were prepared each day and stored at 4◦C
between experiments. For storage, biosensors were kept inculture medium without phosphate for 30 days.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. APA measurements
The ﬁrst step of this work was to conﬁrm the possibility
to detect APA with algae conductometric biosensors. Theprinciple of operation of such biosensor is based on thefollowing reaction:
substrate
phosphatase−−−−−→product +PO3−

The two most widely used substrates for assays are p-
nitrophenyl phosphate and 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate,leading to the release of p-nitrophenol and 4-methylumbel-
liferone, respectively. As APA can be measured by bioas-says using MUP, comparisons with biosensors could bedone readily. As shown in Fig. 1, the curves have the same
shape and the same substrate concentration range for theC. Chouteau et al./Biosensors and Bioelectronics 19 (2004) 1089–1096 1093

two different transduction modes: the signal increases up to
a saturating substrate concentration.
Further measurements with biosensors were carried out
with both substrates, MUP and pNPP (see Figs. 1 and 2 ).
After comparing the results with both substrates ( Table 1),
pNPP looked as more suitable as it gave the highest signalamplitudes and allowed to get a typical Mickaelis–Mentenkinetic, as shown in Fig. 2(Rawn, 1989 ). Moreover, pNPP
is prepared from tablets dissolved in distilled water con-trary to MUP for which a solvent is required that created abackground noise when injected. Therefore, the followingexperiments were done with pNPP as the most appropriatesubstrate.
Two membranes were studied for biosensors: BSA mem-
branesandcalciumalginatemembranes.Asshownin Fig.2,
the signal measured using calcium alginate membranesdecreases for high pNPP concentrations (>0.3mM pNPP)contrary to the signal for BSA membranes that is clearly aMickaeliskineticwithasaturationlevelfrom0.5mMpNPP.
Dainty et al. (1986) have shown that cation chelating
agents such as phosphate can cause disruption or dissolu-tion of alginate beads . The alkaline phosphatase enzymaticreaction produces phosphate ions. Moreover, Dainty et al.have also shown that calcium alginate beads were stable forpH up to 5.5 and low phosphate concentrations but for in-creasing pH and phosphate concentrations, bead dissolutionincreased. The APA measurements were carried out at pH8.5,whichisclearlyoutoftheoptimalstabilitypHrangeforalginate gels. Therefore, calcium alginate membranes werenot appropriate for this work.
Fig. 5. For high algae concentration, the substrate is transformed on the membrane border where lots of enzymes are available. Yet, the local conducti vity
variation resulting of the enzymatic reaction can not be detected by the sensitive area.ConsideringBSAmembranes,thetoxicityofGAvapours
for algae was checked. Before proceeding to experimentswith biosensors, 96-well plates ﬁlled with algae solutions(at different concentrations in the range 6 ×10
7to≈1.2×
107cells/ml)wereplacedinsaturatedGAvapourfor20min.
For a 30min long exposure, APA was inhibited of 15% atthe most. Since biosensors were placed for less than 30minin GA vapours, this inhibition was not considered as signif-icant. BSA membranes were ﬁnally been chosen for futureexperiments.
For these membranes, GA vapour exposure is an impor-
tantparametersinceGAasacross-linkergivesitsresistanceto the membranes. As shown in Fig. 3an optimal signal can
be observed for a 20min long exposure, the curve throughthe points was inserted to guide the eye and represents nomodel. In addition, APA was measured every 10min for 2husing BSA membranes exposed to 10, 14, 18 and 20min toGA vapours to follow the signal stability. For GA exposurelowerthan14min,theAPAsignaldecreasedtoatleast30%after 2h. For 18 and 20min no signiﬁcant decrease was ob-served. These results conﬁrm the operational stability for a20min-long exposure to GA vapours.
Concerning algae concentrations in membranes, it exists

the sensitive areas. As a consequence, a low signal was ob-

et al., 2002 ).

Theconductometricbiosensorsdevelopedaresupposedto
be used for the detection of pollutants, especially cadmiumions.
Note: Inhibition rates will be considered as signiﬁcant when
they exceed 10–15%.
Two different exposures were tested to study alkaline
phosphataseinhibitionscausedbytheseions.First,forshortexposuretimes,acomparisonbetweencurvesobtainedwithbioassays and biosensors was done (see Fig. 7). In both
cases, for smaller cadmium concentrations ( <10ppb), a
slight increase can be observed, whereas APA is inhibitedby high cadmium concentrations. The activation of someenzymes by low cadmium concentrations has already beenstudied for long exposures (>1h) it could be explained bycellular stress: indeed to prevent the cell from cadmiumdamages, stress promoters are produced inducing an in-creaseofsomeenzymaticactivities( Olabarrietaetal.,2001;C.

For long exposures ( Table 2), from 0 to 2h, we obtained
higher inhibition rates with biosensors than with bioassays.
Inhibition (or activation for short exposures) rates are
higher using biosensors than bioassays. It can be explainedby the different ratios ‘number of alga cells/cadmium’ inboth cases. Indeed in membranes, low amounts of algaewere immobilised compared to bioassays using free algae:for biosensors, the ratio algae/cadmium is lower than forbioassays. As inhibitions rates are inversely proportional tothese ratios, as a result, biosensors give higher inhibitionrates and they seem to be more sensitive to detect the APAmodiﬁcations.
4. Conclusion
Theconductometricbiosensorpresentedinthispaperuses
a new type of membranes containing immobilised wholecells.
In aquatic ecosystems, algae are the ﬁrst trophic level:
any disturbances could be reported to upper levels. Thisis one of the main interest of this work since it gave theopportunity to follow the response of a living organismto a pollutant, namely cadmium ions. An organism pos-sesses different self-defence mechanisms which can reducethe theoretical effects of pollutants. Contrary to chemicalanalysis used to detect determined pollutants, whole cellbiosensors can detect any stresses disturbing the organismmetabolism.
For environmental management, the small and quick an-
swering biosensors presented in this paper can be consid-ered as competitive in situ tools as soon as the effects ofpollutants on APA can be reversed, which means reusablemembranes.Astudyledonphosphataseenzymeshowedtheefﬁciency of EDTA ( Zhylyak et al., 1995; Corbisier et al.,
1999; Kim et al., 2000 ) to reverse the action of some heavy
metal ions. This is one of the main issue that will be studiedwith these biosensors.
Interferences of real matrices with these biosensors will
have to be considered in future works. It is important topoint out that these algal sensors can only be used to anal-yse aqueous samples taken from rivers, lakes, underground
waters or from soils (leachates).
