ABSTRACT  
 
Azoreductases are the enzymes which catalyze the re ductive cleavage of azo bonds to produce colorless aromatic 
amine products. Azoreductases are observed in many organisms, including the rat liver enzyme, rabbit l iver 
aldehyde oxidase and intestinal microbiota. Several  studies have been investigated bacterial Cytoplasm ic 
azoreductases, and suggested that they can be appli ed for the purpose of environmental biotechnology.  In the 
present study, the enzyme Azoreductase was assayed for extracellular activity. As there was no signifi cant activity 
observed, intracellular release of the enzyme was p erformed. After each step of purification the activ ity was assayed 
and it was found that the specific activity of the enzyme increased after each step of purification. A zoreductase 
activity in the crude cell extract was found to be 0.0015 U/mg. After ammonium sulfate precipitation, the activity 
increased to 91.66 U/mg. The optimum pH found for t he activity of azoreductase enzyme was pH 7 with an  activity 
of 0.0010 U/mg. The optimum temperature was found t o be 40°C with an activity of 0.00098 U/mg.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Bioremediation is the microbial clean up approach, microbes can acclimatize themselves to toxic wastes  and new 
resistant strains develop naturally, which can tran sform various toxic chemicals to less harmful forms . A major 
mechanism behind biodegradation of different recalc itrant compounds in microbial system is because of the 
biotransformation enzymes [1, 2]. Bacterial degrada tion of azo dyes is often mediated by azoreductases , are the 
enzymes which catalyze the reductive cleavage of az o bonds (–N N–) to produce colorless aromatic amine  products 
[3] which are more efficient under static and anoxi c conditions. Bacterial degradation of azo dyes is often initiated 
by cleavage of azo bonds by azoreductases which are  followed by the aerobic degradation of the Microbi al 
degradation of azo dyes is commonly initiated by th e reduction of the azo bonds by a group of NADH or NADPH 
dependant azoreductases with many requiring flavin as a cofactor. Azo dyes are mainly metabolized by b acteria to 
colorless aromatic amines, some of which are carcin ogenic, by azoreductases that catalyze a NAD(P)H-de pendent 
reduction. The resulting amines are further degrade d aerobically by bacteria. 
 
Azoreductase is the key enzyme responsible for the reductive azo dye degradation in bacterial species.  The presence 
of oxygen normally inhibits the azo bond reduction activity, since aerobic respiration may dominate us e of the 
NADH, thus impeding electron transfer from NADH to the azo bonds [4]. The advantage of the anaerobic r eduction 
of azo dyes is that oxygen depletion is easily acco mplished in microaerophilic cultures thus enabling anaerobic, P. Saranraj et al                                                  Cent. Euro. J. Exp. Bio.,  2014, 3 (2):19-25

and is extremely unspecific [5]. However, the preci se mechanism of anaerobic azoreduction is still not  totally 
understood. It was recently suggested that microbia l anaerobic azoreduction was linked to the electron  transport 
chain, and that Dissimilatory azoreduction was a fo rm of microbial anaerobic respiration [6]. In addit ion, different 
models for the nonspecific reduction of azo dyes by  bacteria, which do not require transport of the az o dyes or 
reduced flavins through the cell membrane, or that describe the extracellular reduction of azo dyes by  anaerobic 
bacteria, were recently suggested [7]. 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
2.1. Microorganisms used 
Six different bacterial isolates viz ., Bacillus odyssey , Bacillus thuringiensis , Bacillus subtilis , Bacillus cereus,  
Alcaligenes  sp. and Nocardiopsis alba . The bacterial isolates were isolated and identifi ed from the textile dye 
effluent. 
 
2.2. Purification and characterization of azoreduct ase enzyme 
Cells from the mid log phase culture were harvested  by centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4 °C. Pellets 
were disrupted by sonication at 40% power for 6 min utes. The cell lysate was subjected to fractionated  ammonium 
sulfate precipitation at 40% saturation to remove i mpurities, followed by 70% saturation in a second s tep to 
precipitate the azoreductase. After 24 hrs, the pre cipitated protein is centrifuged for 10 minutes at 10000 rpm at 4°C 
and the pellet was dissolved in equal volume of 50m M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). Ammonium sul fate 
precipitated sample was then desalted by dialysis a gainst phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7) overnight und er room 
temperature.  2mL of the resulting solution was fra ctionated by anion exchange chromatography using DE AE 
sephadex column installed in an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AKTA purifier; pump P- 900, monitor pH/C- 9 00, 
monitor UV-900, auto sampler Frac-950. Elution buff er (sodium phosphate buffer containing 1M NaCl was set to a 
gradient of 100% for 150 minutes. Proteins were elu ted at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/minute. The fractionat ed sample 
was concentrated using protein purification column.  Active fractions were collected and stored as the purified 
enzyme preparation. 
 
2.3. Assay of Azoreductase activity  
Assays were carried out in cuvettes with a total vo lume of 1mL using Ultrospec 2100 UV-VIS Spectrophot ometer 
(Amersham Biosciences). The reaction mixture consis ts of 400µl of potassium phosphate buffer with 200 µl of 
sample and 200 µl of reactive dyes (500 mg/l). The reaction was started by addition of 200 µl of NADH (7mg/mL) 
and was monitored photometrically at 502 nm. The li near decrease of absorption was used to calculate t he 
azoreductase activity [8]. One unit of azoreductase  can be defined as the amount of enzyme required to  decolorize 1 
µ mol of acid red per minute. 
 
2.4. pH and Temperature optima for the stability of  the Azoreductase 
The effect of pH on azoreductase activity was deter mined by incubating the reaction mixture at pH valu es ranging 
from 5 to 9. The optimum temperature for enzyme act ivity was determined by conducting the assay at var ious 
temperatures from 30°C to 70°C in 50mM potassium ph osphate buffer (pH 7).The relative activity of azor eductase 
at each temperature was determined.   
 
2.5. Protein estimation 
The protein concentration of Azoreductase was estim ated by following the method of Lowry et al . [9]. 
 
2.6. Molecular weight estimation by SDS - PAGE 
The molecular weight of the Azoreductase was estima ted by Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate – Polyacrylamide Aga rose 
Gel Electrophoresis 9SDS – PAGE) Technique.

DISCUSSION 
 
Azoreductases isolated from several bacteria have b een shown to be inducible flavoproteins and to use both NADH 
and NADPH as electron donors [10]. The presence of oxygen normally inhibits the azo bond reduction act ivity, 
since aerobic respiration may dominate use of the N ADH; thus impeding electron transfer from NADH to t he azo 
bonds. The advantage of the anaerobic reduction of azo dyes is that the depletion of oxygen is easily accomplished 
in microaerophilic cultures thus enabling anaerobic , facultative anaerobic and microaerobic bacteria t o reduce azo 
dyes. The reaction takes place at neutral pH values  and is extremely unspecific [11]. However, the pre cise 
mechanism of anaerobic azo-reduction is not yet tot ally understood. A different model was recently sug gested for 
the nonspecific reduction of azo dyes by bacteria, which does not require transport of the azo dyes or  reduced flavins 
through the cell membrane [12]. 
 
Bacterial degradation of dyes is often an enzymatic  reaction linked to anaerobiosis [13, 14]. Thus, th e bacterial 
reduction of dyes under anaerobic or anoxic conditi ons is non-specific to the kind of dye involved [15 ]. The total 
activity and specific activity of crude azoreductas e obtained from the bacterial isolates and consorti um was assessed 
in the present study. The total activity of crude a zoreductase was maximum in the azoreductase obtaine d from 
bacterial consortium (8.320 U) followed by Bacillus odyssey (7.859 U), Bacillus thuringiensis (7.120 U), Bacillus 
subtilis (5.550 U), Bacillus cereus (3.602 U) and Alcaligenes  sp. (1.273 U). Least azoreductase activity was not iced 
in the azoreductase produced by Nocardiopsis alba (0.988 U). The best specific activity of crude azor eductase was 
recorded in the bacterial consortium. Fatemeh et al . [16] also reported extracellular enzymatic activi ty 
(azoreductase) for anaerobic bacteria. 
 
The total activity and specific activity of partial ly purified azoreductase obtained from the bacteria l isolates and 
consortium was determined. The total activity of pa rtially purified azoreductase was high in the azore ductase 
obtained from bacterial consortium (5.275 U) follow ed by Bacillus odyssey (4.936 U), Bacillus thuringiensis (4.521 
U), Bacillus subtilis (2.115 U), Bacillus cereus (1.615 U) and Alcaligenes  sp. (0.973 U). Least azoreductase activity 
was noticed in the azoreductase produced by Nocardiopsis alba (0.388 U). The best specific activity of partially 
purified azoreductase activity was recorded in the bacterial consortium.   
 
Fatemeh et al . [16] also reported extracellular enzymatic activi ty (azoreductase) for anaerobic bacteria. The isola ted 
strains from the microbial consortium identified as  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  and Bacillus circulans . Identification 
of some other isolated strains (NAD1 and NAD6) is i n progress. A number of Pseudomonas  sp. and Bacillus  sp. 
have been known to produce azoreductas [17]. 
 
Earlier studies provided evidence that microbial an aerobic azo-reduction was linked to the electron tr ansport chain, 
and suggested that dissimilatory azo-reduction was a form of microbial anaerobic respiration [18]. In addition, 
different models for the non-specific reduction of azo dyes by bacteria, which did not require transpo rt of the azo 
dyes or reduced flavins through the cell membrane a nd that described the extracellular reduction of az o dyes by 
anaerobic bacteria, were recently suggested. These results suggested that azo dye reduction was a stra in specific 
mechanism that could be performed by an azoreductas e enzyme or by a more complex metabolic pathway. 
 
The effect of pH stability on azoreductase activity  was evaluated. The azoreductase activity was asses sed at pH – 5, 
pH – 6, pH – 7, pH – 8 and pH – 9. Maximum azoreduc tase activity was recorded by the bacterial consort ium at pH 
– 7 (9.641 U/ml) followed by pH – 6 (7.561U/ml), pH  – 5 (6.770 U/ml), pH – 8 (5.236 U/ml) and pH – 9 ( 4.550 
U/ml). Next to bacterial consortium, maximum azored uctase activity was observed in Bacillus odyssey , Bacillus 
thuringiensis , Bacillus subtilis , Bacillus cereus , Alcaligenes  sp. and Nocardiopsis alba . The effect of temperature P. Saranraj et al                                                  Cent. Euro. J. Exp. Bio.,  2014, 3 (2):19-25

Scholars Research Library  stability on azoreductase activity was investigated . The azoreductase activity was assessed at 30°C, 4 0°C, 50°C, 
60°C and 70°C. Maximum azoreductase activity was re corded by the bacterial consortium at 40°C (9.431U/ ml) 
followed by 30°C (8.896 U/ml), 50°C (8.621 U/ml), 6 0°C (7.772 U/ml) and 70°C (7.623 U/ml). Next to bac terial 
consortium, maximum azoreductase activity was obser ved in Bacillus odyssey , Bacillus thuringiensis , Bacillus 
subtilis , Bacillus cereus , Alcaligenes  sp. and Nocardiopsis alba . Temperature optima for azoreductases from 
Bacillus  subtilis  reported in the literature range from 40 to 45°C [ 19, 20]. Similarly, in this work, the azoreductase 
from Bacillus  cereus  showed a temperature optimum at 40°C with a pH opt imum at pH 7. 
 
The major mechanism involved in the microbial biode gradation of synthetic azo dyes is based on their 
biotransformation by enzymes [21]. The initial step  involved in the biodegradation of azo dyes is the reductive 
cleavage of azo bond (–N N–) with the azoreductase [22]. Further, a significant induction in the activ ity of 
azoreductase was observed in the cell free extracts  of both the strains AK1 and AK2 during Metanil Yel low 
decolorization when compared to the control cells. Such inductive pattern of azoreductase was observed  during 
decolorization of sulfonated azo dyes by Kerstersia  sp. strain VKY1  [23] and Galactomyces geotrichum  MTCC 
1360 [24]. 
 
The total protein content of crude and partially pu rified azoreductase obtained from the bacterial iso lates and 
bacterial consortium was studied. Total protein con tent was maximum in the crude azoreductase when com pared to 
the partially purified azoreductase. Protein conten t was maximum in the azoreductase produced by bacte rial 
consortium (Crude azoreductase – 1455 µg/ml; Partia lly purified azoreductase – 1025 µg/ml), Bacillus odyssey 
(Crude azoreductase – 1390 µg/ml; Partially purifie d azoreductase – 990 µg/ml), Bacillus thuringiensis (Crude 
azoreductase – 1261 µg/ml; Partially purified azore ductase – 829 µg/ml), Bacillus subtilis (Crude azoreductase – 
1150 µg/ml; Partially purified azoreductase – 711 µ g/ml), Bacillus cereus (Crude azoreductase – 981 µg/ml; 
Partially purified azoreductase – 628 µg/ml), Alcaligenes  sp. (Crude azoreductase – 805 µg/ml; Partially pur ified 
azoreductase – 585 µg/ml) and Nocardiopsis alba (Crude azoreductase – 719 µg/ml; Partially purified  azoreductase 
– 471 µg/ml). 
 
According to a review by Hanson et al . [25], sulfatase enzyme was involved in hydrolytic  desulfonation of sulfate 
esters (CO–S) and sulfamates (CN–S) and this enzyme  was discovered in Enterococcus faecalis . More biological 
functions of this enzyme from prokaryotic sources h ave yet to be discovered and explored. Desulfonatio n was 
previously reported as a step in biodegradation of other sulfonated aromatic compounds, including subs tituted 
naphthalene sulfonates and benzene sulfonates [26, 27]. 
 
Dawkar et al . [28] showed induction in the intracellular lignin  peroxidase, laccase and NADH-DCIP reductase 
during decolorization of Brown 3REL by Bacillus  sp. VUS. They also showed the induction (upto 42% 
decolorization) of the riboflavin reductase activit y and then decreased afterwards. Recently, Selvakum aran et al . 
[29] reported on the genetic diversity of aromatic ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase (ARHD) genes from Citrobacter  
spp. which code for dioxygenase enzymes. The variab ility of these dioxygenases would be reflected upon  their 
functional diversity and their ability to completel y degrade of benzoate, hydroxybenzoic acid and phen ol.
