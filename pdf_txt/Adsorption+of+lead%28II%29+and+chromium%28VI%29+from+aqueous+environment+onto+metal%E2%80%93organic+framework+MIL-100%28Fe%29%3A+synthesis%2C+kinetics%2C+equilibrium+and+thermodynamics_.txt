abstract
This work focuses on the removal of lead using immobilized Gracilaria corticata (immobilized-GC) 
algal based bioadsorbent. To characterize the surface morphology of the adsorbent by various analyt-
ical techniques such as scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda analysis 
were performed. The effect of different parameters was investigated in batch experiments. For the 
treatment of a Pb(II) solution at 25 mg/L, the removal efficiency of 99.1% was achieved using 1 g/L adsorbent at a mixing time of 75 min and pH of 6 during the adsorption process. Thermodynamics 
analyses indicate that the Pb(II) sorption on immobilized-GC is feasible, spontaneous, and endo-
thermic with enthalpy and entropy equal to 52.01 kJ/mol and 0.185 kJ/mol K, respectively. Kinetic studies revealed that the adsorption process follows pseudo-second-order due to the higher 
regression coefficient and lower error coefficient. The adsorption isotherms of Pb(II) were also 
compared with popular models, and it was found that the Pb(II) uptake was well-described by the Langmuir model with maximum adsorption capacities of 89.1, 98.3, 108.2, and 122.1 mg/g at 
20°C, 30°C, 40°C, and 50°C, respectively.

1. Introduction
Contamination of aquatic environments by heavy met-
als is one of the major environmental challenges because 
of their flexibility, aggregation, persistence, and non-  
biodegradable nature [1,2]. Some of the toxic heavy metals, 
in particular lead, can have severe and poisonous effects 
on human beings and marine organisms even at trace 
levels [3,4].Pb(II), a soft blue-gray metallic element, has been 
widely used in diverse industrial areas such as paints, bat-teries, leaded glasses, fuels, pigments, photographic materi-als, petrochemicals, mining, etc. [5]. Pb(II) is considered to be a cumulative poison and found to be hazardous at high levels. Due to its toxicity, Pb(II) can cause damage to the digestive tract, immune system, human circulatory system, liver, and kidney [6].
With the rapid development of industries, discharge 
of wastewater containing metals ions has been on the rise, F.K. Mostafapour et al. / Desalination and Water Treatment 265 (2022) 103–113 104
which has negative impact on the surrounding ecologi-
cal environments [7]. Most industrial wastewaters contain high concentrations of Pb(II), which can cause irreversible damage to human and animal health and pollute water resources [8]. Pb(II) can bioaccumulate at low concentrations in humans, causing toxic effects and even carcinogenesis [9]. Thus, its contamination has become a serious prob-lem. Various methods, such as coagulation–flocculation, ion exchange, and electrochemical treatment, have been employed to separate lead from aqueous solutions [10,11]. However, the drawbacks of these techniques include high operating costs, difficulty in scaling up, and the generation of a large volume of toxic sludge [12,13].
As a result, adsorbent separation processes have attrac-
ted the attention of researchers because of their relatively simple operational processes, selectivity, sensitivity, low by-product formation potential, low cost, and easy regen-eration procedures [14–16].
Biosorption utilizes low-cost biosorbents such as grape 
shoot, olive root, peat, rose wastes, bacteria, yeasts, fungi, microalgae, and marine macroalgae for the elimination of heavy metals from wastewaters [17,18]. Algal biomass has significant and various affinities towards a number of heavy metals as sorbent materials [19].
The immobilization of algal biomass is an important 
phase in the commercial scale-up of metal biosorption. Immobilization, unlike algal biomass in its natural state, gives biosorbent particles the density, suitable size, and mechanical strength that continuous systems need [20]. Immobilization can also save up to 50%–70% of the over -
all separation cost of the biomass from the processed solu-tion. This method can also be used to regenerate biomass in several adsorption–desorption phases. Currently, alginate, chitosan, porous resin, and activated charcoal have been tested as carriers for immobilizing cells [21].
Alginate is a linear copolymer that makes up a signifi-
cant percentage of the dry weight of all algae species, and each constituent residue naturally comprises carboxyl groups. The carboxylate function is supposed to be respon-sible for its high affinity for divalent cations like cadmium, copper, cobalt, and others [21]. The process of forming algi-nate beads (structure of “egg-box”) by dropping a mixture comprising biosorbents and Na-alginate into a solution of calcium chloride has been widely studied. Calcium atoms can cross-link and form salt bridges between the blocks of guluronic acid of alginate chains pair [22]. Since algi-nate has good biocompatibility, low cost, binding capacity, and good hydrophilicity [23], it was used in this study as a carrier for immobilization of the marine macroalgae.
According to the literature, the elimination of heavy 
metals by bioadsorbent [24–26] is widely studied; however, the elimination of heavy metals by immobilized algal is poorly studied.
Also, in most studies, equilibrium data using regres-
sion coefficients are used to match isotherms and kinetics. But employment of regression coefficient alone will not be enough for adaptability. Therefore, for more accuracy, different error coefficients were used in this study.
Our objective was to test the adsorption efficiency of 
immobilized Gracilaria corticata algal, which is very abun-
dant in Iran, for the elimination of Pb(II). The optimization of the experimental operating conditions such as the mixing time, the initial pH, the amount of Pb(II) and immobilized Gracilaria corticata (immobilized-GC), and the temperature was carried out. Various techniques were carried out to examine the as prepared bioadsorbents characteristics, that is, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller/Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The kinetic, isotherm and thermodynamic models were applied to explain the ads-orption behavior. Also, error functions were calculated.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Chemicals
Pb(II) nitrate solution (Pb(NO
3)2) was used to synthe-
size the Pb(II) aqueous solution and purchased from Merck 
Co., Germany. Sodium alginate or Na-alginate (216.12 g/mol and NaC
6H7O6) was purchased from PubChem Co., USA. 
Sigma Aldrich supplied NaOH and HCl. All solutions were prepared using distilled water. All chemicals were of ana-lytical grade and used without further purification.
2.2. Immobilization of algal biomass
Gracilaria corticata algae were collected from the Chab-
ahar coast in Sistan and Baluchestan province, Iran. 
The GC was vigorously washed with tap water for the 
removal of salts. The epiphytic microorganisms were then 
washed with distilled water, dried to a constant weight 
in an oven at 80°C at 120 min, ground, and sieved into 
80–125 µm fractions.
The GC biomass was immobilized by dissolving 
2 g of Na-alginate in 50 mL distilled water for 30 min at 80°C with constant stirring. Based on available standards 
and studies, the most effective amount of biomass was 
2 g [23]. After cooling, 2 g of GC biomass was added to 
the solution of Na-alginate and stirred for 10 min at room 
temperature. The mixture of Na-alginate-GC biomass 
was dropped into a solution of 2% CaCl
2. To enhance the 
mechanical strength of the beads, they were soaked in the 
solution of calcium chloride for 2 h at room temperature with stirring gently. For removing residual Ca
2+ from the 
adsorbent surfaces, they were washed three times with distilled water and then placed in the refrigerator at 4°C before use in the experiments.
Adsorbent properties were determined using Fourier 
transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) technique (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc model FTIR is 10, USA), and scanning electron microscope (SEM-JEOL, JSM-IT300) methods. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (Micromeritics, 3Flex) method was used to determine the specific surface area and pore volume of the adsorbent.
2.3. Adsorption studies
Five adsorption experiment series were implemented on 
immobilized-GC adsorbents at different adsorption circum-
stances, including initial Pb(II) concentration, adsorption 
temperature, adsorbent dosage, and initial pH of the solu-
tion. All Pb(II) adsorption experiments were done in batch 105 F.K. Mostafapour et al. / Desalination and Water Treatment 265 (2022) 103–113
mode scale under various experimental conditions, includ-
ing concentration 10–100 mg/L, mixing time 10–120 min, 
immobilized-GC dosage (0.025–0.25 g per 100 mL of Pb(II) 
solution), pH 2–8, and temperature 20–50°C with continu-
ous shaking. The amount of Pb(II) in the solution was mea-sured via atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS-AGILENT 
280FS AA).
Eqs. (1) and (2) were used to calculate the amount of 
Pb(II) uptake and Pb(II) removal % [27,29].

2.4. Error analysis
The best isotherm and kinetic models were determined 
by the correlation coefficient (R2) analysis. Although this is 
useful in determining the efficiency of the correlation anal-
ysis, this analysis has limitations in solving isotherm and kinetic models that are not inherently linear. Therefore, we used three error functions to find a suitable model to rep-resent the experimental data [30,31]. The error functions used are expressed as Eqs. (3)–(5).

3. Results and discussion
The morphology of the adsorbent was characterized by 
SEM (Fig. 1a and b). Fig. 4a shows that immobilized-GC 
has a highly rough surface with a large number of pores, indicating that there is considerable potential for biosorp-tion of Pb(II). The decrease in the number of pores on the adsorbent surface occurred after the adsorption of Pb(II) (Fig. 4b), which indicates the adsorption of Pb(II) on the 
adsorbent surface. Additionally, as a result of the Pb(II) ions accumulation on the cell surface, the surface of free and immobilized-GC biomass has shrunk, become more irregular, and has spots.
The FTIR analysis for determining the functional 
groups was performed, and its results, before and after Pb(II) uptake, are shown in Fig. 2c and d. A strong peak at 3,422 cm
–1, representing the stretching of the O–H and N–H 
bonds of the amine groups, was shifted after Pb(II) adsorp-
tion, which suggests that the bonds of O–H and N–H are 
involved in Pb(II) ion adsorption. The band at 2,921 cm–1 represents C–H bonds, showing the presence of carbox-ylic groups from fractions of phospholipids and lipids in 
biomass. Peaks at 1,785 and 1,517 cm
–1, suggesting that the 
C=O and S groups are involved in the biosorption of Pb(II). The absorption peaks at 1,623 cm
–1 were interrelated to the 
stretching vibration of C=N. The band at 1,471 cm–1 shifted 
to 1425, which was related to CH2 and CH3 bending of 
methyl and C–O stretching vibration of carboxylic group, 
respectively. The peaks at 1,293 cm–1 present after biosorp-
tion of Pb(II) ions assigned to stretching vibration of C–C–O. Also, peak at 1,162 cm
–1 represents stretching vibrations of 
hydrogen–bonding C–OH groups, implying the presence of carbohydrate. The band at 1,081 cm
–1 which indicates 
stretching vibrations of C–O (primary alcohol), was moved 
to 1,074 cm–1 after Pb(II) biosorption. Furthermore, the shift 
of the band at 895 to 882 cm–1 reveals Pb(II) ion binding to 
the amine group present on the algal surface.
In Fig. 1e, f, the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms 
of immobilized-GC are depicted. According to the IUPAC system, the results were found to be type IV isotherm and 
exhibited an H3 hysteresis loop at 0.5 < p/p
0 < 1.0. Further, the 
BJH average pore diameters of immobilized-GC proved to be 9.1 nm. The values of the average pore diameters determined that the adsorbent had a mesoporous structure according to IUPAC classification. In addition, the average pore vol-umes and average surface area of immobilized-GC were 0.12 cm
3/g and 84.2 m2/g.
Table 1 shows the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy 
results for immobilized-GC and GC adsorbents. As can be seen, Na in the synthesized adsorbent has replaced other elements, and there is about 6% Na. In general, the adsor -
bent is composed of the main elements of nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, and other elements are present in small amounts.
3.1. Effect of effective parameters on Pb(II) uptake
The effect of the initial pH on the percentage of Pb(II) 
removed was investigated at pH values of 2–8 using an 
initial immobilized-GC mass of 0.1 g with 100 mL of con-taminated solution. The initial Pb(II) concentration was 25 mg/L at 30°C ± 2°C. The mixture was shaken for 75 min at a constant stirring velocity of 120 rpm. The adsorp-
tion percentage increased as the initial pH of the solution increased from pH 2 to 6 (Fig. 2a). The surface of the immo-bilized-GC became more negatively charged, and subse-quently, the electrostatic attraction (ion exchange) between the metal ions and the surface of the adsorbent probably increased [30]. The increase in adsorption percentage may be attributed to the interaction of Pb
2+, Pb(OH)+, and 
Pb(OH)2 with the functional groups present on the surface 
of the adsorbents due to ion exchange mechanism or by hydrogen bonding [31].
Also, the value of pH
PZC for adsorbent is 6.5, Fig. 2a. 
At pH below pHPZC, the adsorbent surface has a higher neg-
ative charge which allows for more adsorption of Pb(II) cat-ions. For next experiments, an optimal pH value of 6 is used. For pH values below the optimal value, competition between Pb(II) ions and H
3O+ reduces the adsorption efficiency, 
whereas higher pH values result in hydrolysis of Pb(II) spe-cies which encourages precipitation and prevents quantita-tive adsorption [32].F.K. Mostafapour et al. / Desalination and Water Treatment 265 (2022) 103–113 106

This experiments was conducted with different con-
centrations of adsorbents (i.e., 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, and 
2.5 g/L) at the optimal initial pH value, with 100 mL of 
the pollutant solution. The Pb(II) amount was 100 mg/L 
at 30°C ± 2°C, and the mixture was shaken for 90 min at 
a constant stirring velocity of 120 rpm. The maximum 
removal efficiency was obtained to be 99.1%, at a corre-
sponding immobilized-GC dosage of 1 g/L as shown in 
2b. The adsorption percentage increases as the doses of 
the immobilized-GC in the solution increase from 0.25 to 
1 g. These results can be due to the fact that increasing the 
adsorbent dose from 0.25 to 1 g provides more active bind-ing sites for the adsorption process [33]. Thus, more Pb(II) 
ions are adsorbed onto the surface of the adsorbent since 
the competition between molecules for active binding sites is reduced [34]. The optimal dose obtained was 1 g, which was applied for the subsequent batches.
This batch of experiments was conducted at differ -
ent contact times (10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 and 120 min) at 
optimal pH value and adsorbent dose at room tempera-
ture of 30°C ± 2°C using 100 mL of pollutant solution. The Pb(II) amount was 25 mg/L at a constant stirring velocity of 120 rpm. The maximum removal efficiencies obtained were 99.1% at a contact time of 75 min as illustrated in Fig. 2c. 
The adsorption percentage increases with increasing con-tact time from 10 to 75 min. However, it appears that the rate of Pb(II) uptake is the greatest within the initial 30 min because of the availability of active binding sites on the surface of the immobilized-GC [35]. Consequently, it can be seen that the equilibrium of Pb(II) uptake by the adsor -
bent is reached within 75 min, and after that, there was an insignificant change in Pb(II) uptake until 120 min. The study of Pb(II) adsorption was also performed using GC biomass and alginate; it was observed that for a concentra-tion of 25 mg/L, the removal efficiencies using mentioned adsorbents were 89.1% and 78.2% after 120 min, respectively.
This batch was conducted at different concentrations 
of Pb(II) including 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 mg/L at the opti-mal pH value and the optimal immobilized-GC dose obtained from previous batches using 100 mL of contam-inated solution at 30°C ± 2°C. The mixture was shaken for 
75 min at a constant stirring velocity of 150 rpm. The max-imum removal efficiencies were 99.1% at Pb(II) amount of 25 mg/L, as shown in Fig. 2c. The results suggest that the percentage of Pb(II) removal by adsorption increases as the Pb(II) amount increases to a certain extent. The adsorp-tion percentage increased from 93.2% to 99.1% as the Pb(II) amount was increased from 10 to 25 mg/L. Thereafter, the 
percentage of Pb(II) removal decreases as the Pb(II) amount 
increases to a value of 100 mg/L. This can be interpreted as 
at a fixed amount of adsorbent, the high initial Pb(II) con-centration leads to an excess amount of available particles compared with the active binding site on the adsorbent sur -
face, so that, the percentage of Pb(II) removal by adsorption  
decreases [36].
This batch was conducted at different temperature val-
ues (e.g., 293, 303, 313 and 323 K (20°C–50°C)) at an opti-mal pH of 6.0, an optimal dose of adsorbents equal to 0.1 g, 
and 100 mL contaminated solution of 100 mg/L Pb(II). The 
mixture was shaken for 75 min at a constant stirring veloc-
ity of 120 rpm. The maximum removal efficiencies were

99.4% at a temperature of 323 K°C as shown in Fig. 2d; this 
indicates that the adsorption process is an endothermic  
reaction [37].
3.2. Isotherm study
The isotherm study was conducted by varying the 
amount of Pb(II) in synthetic wastewater from 10 to 100 mg/L. 
The experiment was performed by adding immobilized-GC into 100 mL flasks containing Pb(II) solution. Then, the con-tents were mechanically stirred at 120 rpm for a given time at different temperatures. Next, the solutions were filtered using Whatman filter paper having an average pore size of 0.45 µm. The data obtained from the experiment were lin-early fitted for the different isotherms as described as follows.
3.3. Langmuir isotherm
The Langmuir isotherm quantitatively describes the 
monolayer adsorption on the outer surface of the immobi-
lized-GC. The Langmuir isotherm can be expressed as fol-lows [38,39]:

3.4. Freundlich isotherm
The Freundlich isotherm is an empirical adsorption 
model, which can be applied to nonideal biosorption on heterogeneous surfaces as well as multilayer sorption. The isotherm is displayed as shown in Eq. (7) [40,41]:

3.5. Temkin isotherm
The Temkin isotherm contains a factor that explicitly 
takes into account adsorbent–adsorbate interactions. As implied in the equation, its derivation is characterized by a uniform distribution of binding energies and is expressed as in Eq. (8) [42].

3.6. Dubinin–Radushkevich isotherm
The last isotherm is the Dubinin–Radushkevich model, 
which describes the adsorption energy between adsorbate and adsorbent in terms of the adsorption potential (ε). The 
Dubinin–Radushkevich isotherm model can be described 
by Eqs. (9)–(11) [44,45]:

The value of β can be calculated from the slope by plot-
ting the straight line between lnqe and ε2.
The fit of the model with the experimental results 
was evaluated using linear regression analysis, as seen in 
Table 2. Thus, it is noted that the R2 obtained at all tempera-
tures from the Langmuir isotherm was the highest. Such a high value indicated that the Langmuir isotherm was the best model for Pb(II) adsorption, suggesting monolayer adsorp-tion on the heterogeneous surface. Similar results were reported when adsorbents from polypyrrole composites were used to remove Pb(II) ions [46]. The maximum adsor -
ption capacity, q
max, was 89.1, 98.3, 108.2, and 122.1 mg/g 
at 20°C, 30°C, 40°C, and 50°C, respectively. According to the obtained values of the separation factor or equilibrium

constant, RL was between 0.15 and 0.37, which indicated the 
favorability of the adsorption process.
The (1/n) value is less than unity. It means that the 
adsorption process is preferred, the surface is heterogeneous, 
and there are fewer interactions between the adsorbed ions. It also means that Pb(II) adsorption occurs through multi- molecular and multi-anchorage adsorption mechanisms.
The higher Elovich parameters (β and α), determined 
from the slope and intercept of the plotting of q
t against 
lnt, respectively, indicate a greater rate of chemical sorption conﬁrming the adsorption type of pseudo-second-order.
The mean biosorption energy (E, kJ/mol) reveals the 
physical or chemical biosorption process. Since the E value 
was greater than 8 kJ/mol (Table 1), it was hypothesized that 
Pb(II) biosorption was accomplished by a chemisorption 
process [46,47].
Several adsorbents from other studies were compared 
with the adsorbents used in this research in terms of their 
adsorption capacities, and the comparison is presented in 
Table 3. According to this comparison, immobilized-GC has a promising future as an adsorbent in wastewater treat-ment, as approved by their excellent results.
3.7. Kinetics study
In order to clarify the reaction order and rate-con-
trolling mechanism, the following linear kinetic models were 
employed.
The pseudo-first-order kinetic model assumes that the 
number of sites that solutes can occupy is proportional to the rate of adsorption. The model is written as in Eq. (12) [49]:
logl og.qq qKtet e/g16/g11/g12 /g32/g161
2303 (12)The pseudo-second-order kinetic model involves 
chemisorption, where the removal of adsorbate from the 
bulk liquid is due to the physiochemical interaction between 
adsorbent and adsorbate. The pseudo-second-order kinetic 
model is shown in Eq. (13) [50]:
t
q Kqt
qt e e/g32/g141
22  (13)
As for the intraparticle diffusion model, it is noted that 
intraparticle diffusion transport is the slowest step of the 
adsorption process between adsorbate and adsorbent as 
compared to film diffusion and pore diffusion. The intrapar -
ticle diffusion model can be written as in Eq. (14) [51]:
qK tCtb/g32/g1412/ (14)
In Table 4 and Fig. 3a and b, linear regression analysis 
and kinetic parameters of pseudo-second-order, pseudo-  
first-order, and intraparticle diffusion models were given. Results revealed that the pseudo-second-order model yielded a higher correlation coefficient (R
2 = 0.99) for dif-
ferent concentrations compared to the pseudo-first-order and the intraparticle diffusion models. This observation indicated that the pseudo-second-order was the most suit -
able model for Pb(II) adsorption using immobilized-GC. Furthermore, previous researchers have reported pseudo-  
second-order as the best fit model for metal adsorption when using adsorbents prepared from graphene oxide-Fe
3O4@polydopamine [52]. Moreover, the magnitude of 
the adsorption capacity of the pseudo-second-order model (q
e cal) was found to be comparable to the value obtained 
experimentally (qe exp). Such a result confirmed the valid-
ity of the pseudo-second-order, proving that the kinetic model applied for Pb(II) adsorption using immobilized-GC was the most suitable. The error coefficient for the pseudo-  
second-order kinetics is less than the pseudo-first-order kinetics. The intraparticle diffusion model describes the basic diffusion processes that occur. Fig. 3b shows the data of linear regression of q
t against t0.5 plots, indicating multi-
linearity (three phases). The slope of the plotting qt against 
t0.5 was used to calculate the rate constant of intraparticle dif-
fusion (Kb) as seen in Table 4. The qt against t0.5 plots in any 
of the cases did not pass through the origin (Ci > 0), imply-
ing that intraparticle diffusion was not the only rate-lim-iting stage, and external mass transfer also played a main role in the adsorption of Pb(II) by immobilized-GC [53].
3.8. Thermodynamic study
The thermodynamic study of the Pb(II) adsorption pro-
cess was carried out at 293, 303, 313, and 323 K; the initial 
concentration of Pb(II) in the solution, pH of the solution, the dosage of adsorbent, and contact time were maintained 
according to the optimal conditions. The change in the 
standard ΔG° for the adsorption process can be calculated, 
as in Eq. (15) [54].

The change in the ΔG° is related to the ΔH° and ΔS° via 
the Gibbs–Helmholtz equation (ΔG° = ΔH° – TΔS°). Thus, kc 
becomes [55]:

RTL/g32/g113/g16/g113 /g39/g39 (16)
Eq. (13) is the Van’t Hoff equation in linear form. Thus, 
plotting lnKL vs. 1/T yielded a straight line, whose slope 
and y-intercept yielded ΔS° and ΔH°, respectively.
Table 5 shows the results of thermodynamic parameters. 
A positive value was observed for ΔH°, which designates 
that the process of adsorption was endothermic. Previous research also reported the same outcome of the endother -
mic Pb(II) adsorption process when employing carbon pre-pared from Enteromorpha prolifera [41]. The positive value of ΔS° indicated an increase in randomness at the adsorbent solution interface [56]. However, negative values of ΔG° demonstrated that the adsorption process was both ther -
modynamic and spontaneous, which is quite feasible; the increase of ΔG° with temperature implies that the process favors higher energy input [57].
3.9. Adsorbent regeneration
Adsorbent recovery was performed in 5 steps. After 
the adsorption process, the adsorbent was collected using a 0.2-micron filter, washed twice with distilled water, 
and finally dried at 80°C. The experiment was performed under optimal conditions obtained from the previous steps 
(C
0: 25 mg/L, initial pH: 6.0, contact time: 90 min, adsor -
bent dose: 2 g/L, and T: 298 K). The results were shown in 
Fig. 4, and as can be seen, after five steps, the removal per -
centage decreases by about 12%. It can be due to the loss of 
adsorbent during washing and collection [58,59].
4. Conclusion
This study investigates the sorption of Pb(II) onto the 
immobilized-GC surface under different reaction condi-
tions such as contact time, pH, Pb(II) ion concentration, and 
temperature in a batch study. From the results obtained, Table 4

it can be concluded that pH is one of the key factors affect-
ing the rate of sorption. After applying the optimal val-
ues of the studied adsorption parameters, the adsorption 
kinetics were investigated using different models, such as pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, and intrapar -
ticle diffusion equation, and pseudo-second-order best 
fits the adsorption of Pb(II). The intraparticle diffusion 
adsorption model showed that the adsorption was a mul-
tistep controlled mechanism. The optimum conditions were achieved at pH of 6, initial Pb(II) concentration of 
10 mg/L at 75 min with an adsorption capacity of 24.9 mg/g 
at room temperature. Due to the high regression coeffi-
cient and the lower error coefficient at all temperatures, 
the Langmuir isotherm model best described the adsorp-tion. According to thermodynamic studies, the negative 
and positive values were obtained for ΔG ° and ΔH °; these 
values are representative of the spontaneous and feasible 
nature and endothermic nature of sorption, respectively. 
In the end, it can be concluded that under the optimal conditions adopted in this study, Pb(II) removal from 
aqueous solutions by adsorption is best obtained using  
immobilized-GC.
