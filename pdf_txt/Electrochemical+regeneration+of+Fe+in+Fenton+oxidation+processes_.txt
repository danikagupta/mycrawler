Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) spielen eine bedeutende Rolle bei der Aufbereitung 
von Abwasser mit persistenten Inhaltsstoffen, welche durch herkömmliche Abwasserbehandlungsverfahren nur schwer oder gar nicht abgebaut werden können. Ethylendiamintetraessigsäure (EDTA), ein persistenter Komplexbildner, der in zahlreichen Industriebranchen eingesetzt wird, mit der Eignung Schwermetalle aus Bodensedimenten zu mobilisieren, diente dieser Arbeit als Modellsubstanz.  
Die gegenwärtige Diplomarbeit behandelt die Charakterisierung einer AOP-Laboranlage für 
photochemische, elektrochemische und katalytische Oxidationsprozesse. Es wurden die Verweilzeitverteilungen unterschiedlicher Reaktoren und einer Elektrolysezelle vermessen, 
sowie  Photonenflüsse in Photoreaktoren bei einer Wellenlänge von 
O= 254. In einem 
weiteren Teil der Arbeit wurde die Herstellung von kathodisch produziertem 
Wasserstoffperoxid (H 2O2) an granuliertem Glaskohlenstoff näher betrachtet.  
Abschließend wurden mit der oben erwähnten Modellsubstanz Abbauuntersuchungen zur 
direkten anodsichen Oxidation, zur Fe(II)-EDTA-Photolyse und zum Kombinationsverfahren „Anodische Oxidation mit kathodisch produziertem H
2O2 welches durch Photolyse aktiviert 
wird“ (Anox/H 2O2cath/UV) durchgeführt.  
Die Verfahrenseffektivität wurde in Beziehung auf die verwendeten Reaktoren und dem

 Abstract  
Advanced Oxidation Processes at the bench scale unit level: 
Characterisation and experimental investigations of 
ethylenediamintetraacetic acid (EDTA) 
Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) have gained in great importance in recent years as 
an alternative method of wastewater treatment. Problems with pollutants not amenable         to biological treatments and with high chemical stability especially revealed the prominent role of that class of oxidation techniques. 
Ethylenediamintetraacetic acid (EDTA), a common applied complexing agent in many 
industrial branches, not only has a high resistance to environmental degradation, but also an ability to bind heavy metal ions, which could cause hazardous effects.  
This master thesis includes the characterization of Advanced Oxidation Processes               
at the bench scale unit, consisting of a low pressure mercury lamp from Heraeus  with power 
output of 35 W and maximum emission at 
O = 254 nm, EC Electro MP-Cell  with iridium oxide 
plate as an anode and glassy carbon as a cathode. In addition there were four exchangeable 
reactors used. The residence time distribution and photon flow in various reactors were 
investigated, as well as hydrogen peroxide production on the cathode. 
Three different AOPs techniques were applied in the studied EDTA degradation process: 
direct EDTA oxidation on the anode, Fe(II)-EDTA photolysis and Anox/H 2O2Cath/UV method. 
Effectiveness of these processes was analyz ed according to the implemented reactor and 
the flow rate of EDTA solution in a bench scale unit. To enable comparison of the various processes from the economical point of view, current efficiency and radiant power efficiency and specific energy demands were calculated from the achieved experimental data. T a b l e  o f  c o n t e s t s                                                                            1

1. Introduction 
1.1. Problem identification 
Increasing environmental awareness is leading to higher restrictions imposed on the emitted 
pollution. The level of water contamination with EDTA – a common applied complexing agent in many industrial branches - is mostly underestimated. Despite EDTA’s low concentration    in surface waters (usually about several dozen ȝg/l), its high resistance to environmental 
degradation and ability to bind heavy metal ions could cause hazardous effects. According to 
European Union Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EG and its environmental quality norm recommendation for other relevant substances, EDTA concentration in surface waters should not exceed 10 ȝg/l. [1],[2] 
As EDTA can be biologically degraded under only a number of specific conditions like 
relatively high hydraulic and sludge retention time, an alkaline pH value of the wastewater,   a relatively high EDTA concentration and no complex bonding with heavy metal ions, in the 
present study the Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) were investigated as an alternative decomposition method. AOPs, sometimes also called Advanced Oxidation Technologies (AOTs) or Enhanced Oxidation Processes (EOPs), rely mainly on the formation of reactive and short-lived oxygen containing intermediates such as hydroxyl radicals (•OH). Besides photochemical and solar photocatalytic processes many other technologies are included      in AOPs, for example electrochemical oxidation of organic water contaminants, catalytic processes and non-thermal plasma treatment methods for exhaust air processing. The greatest advantage of AOPs is that they are „not-invasive“ methods, no sludge formation      is involved, no subsequental disposal has to  be taken into account, only a minimum 
treatment of residues is necessary. There are several alternatives in the selection of the 
auxiliary oxidant (H
2O2, O 3) as well as implementation of synergistic treatment concepts with 
conventional technologies (carbon adsorption, biological treatment). The possibility of applying batch or plug flow modes, also at large volume flows, low preventative maintenance and operating requirements together with reliable safety during operation make AOPs a very interesting option for the wastewater treatment branch. 
EDTA degradation using AOPs instruments was broadly investigated, applying diverse 
combinations, among them H
2O2/UV and Fe2+(Fe3+)/UV were the best known ones.              
In present work three different ways of EDTA decomposition were researched: direct anodic oxidation on the anode, Fe(II)–EDTA photolysis and Anox/H
2O2Cath/UV process. All the 
experiments were carried out at the VTU Technology  laboratory with application of various 
reactors. 
It is well-known that any chemical reaction depends strongly on the reactor set-up. When       
it comes to the photochemical reactions, that fact has even greater importance. The research on the EDTA degradation involved such instruments as coil reactor, small and large plug flow reactor and continuous stirred-tank reactor, which was also used as a batch reactor. To be able to optimise the experiments the characterisation for all these reactors was necessary. Chapter 1 –  I n t r o d u c t i o n                             6

That included description of residence time distribution at different flow rates, photon flow 
and radiant energy determination and also hydrogen peroxide production on the cathode in the electrolysis cell. 
The bench scale unit characterisation constituted the first part of the investigation and 
allowed to carry out the second and main part of the research: EDTA degradation with AOPs instruments. [3], [4]

2. Principles of electrochemistry 
2.1. Electrolysis cell and reactor 
All of the electrochemical processes and substance conversions take place in an 
electrochemical cell. The electrolysis cell could be described as a chemical reactor, in which an electric current is used to bring about an otherwise non-spontaneous chemical reaction. Such an electrolysis cell consists of: 
xelectrolyte 
xelectrodes, which are immersed in the electrolyte 
xelectronics with electrical connections 
xelectrolysis cell body [5], [6] 
 
Figure 2.1: Common  set-up of the electrolysis cell [5]  
2.1.1. Electrodes 
Electrodes are made of conductor material through which electrons leave or enter 
electrochemical cell and simultaneously enable the deposit of ions at their surface.              The electrochemical reactions take place at the surface of electrodes.  
The electrode can act as a source of electrons transferred to the species in the solution.       
In that case we can speak about reduction, which take place on the electrode called ‘cathode’. The reduction reaction is described with Eq. 2.1: 
Eq. 2.1    Ox + ze
-o Red 
The electrode, which act as a sink of electrons transferred from species into the solution is 
the ‘anode’. On the anode an oxidising reaction takes place: Anode 
Redĺ Ox+ze- Cathode 
Ox+ze- ĺ Red

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________  
  
  
Eq. 2.2    Red o Ox + ze- 
To make electron transfer possible, there must be correspondence between the energies of 
the electron orbitals where transfer takes place in the donor and acceptor. In the electrode this level is the highest filled orbital, which in metal is the Fermi energy level and in soluble species – the orbital of the valence electron to be given or received.  
Therefore: 
xfor a reduction, there is a minimum energy that the transferable electrons from the 
electrode must have before transfer can occur (negative potential) 
xfor an oxidation, there is a maximum energy that the lowest unoccupied level in the 
electrode can have in order to receive electrons from species in solution (sufficiently 
positive potential) [7],[8] 
Electrode types
 
The electrodes vary in their size, design and material of which they consist. The most 
important requirements, which the electrode material has to be fulfill are: 
xhigh conductivity 
xadequate chemical resistance against electrolyte and electrolysis products 
xgood mechanical strength and machinability 
xstability 
xhigh electrical activity 
xreasonable price [7],[5] 
There are many electrode materials and the choice of the right one depends on the useful 
potential range of the electrode in the particular solvent and the qualities and purity of the 
material.  
The most frequently materials are:  
xmetal electrodes  
xcarbon electrodes  
xother solid materials: semiconductors, for example metal oxides and conducting 
organic salts 
xmercury drop electrodes (liquid nature) 
A metal electrode is the most typical one. A general advantage is that the high conductivity of 
metal electrodes results in low background currents. It could be applied as a foil, mesh or wire, but it is preferable to present it to the solution in a compact way. 
Carbon electrodes exist in various conducting forms. Carbon has a high surface activity and 
therefore is susceptible to poisoning by organic compounds. Bonds with hydrogen, hydroxyl 
and carboxyl groups can be formed on the carbon surface. Carbon in the form of glassy 
carbon is widely used, especially when a chemical inert electrode without the catalytic power of platinum is required. [7],[8],[9]

2.1.2. Electrolyte 
The main function of electrolytes is transporting of ions between electrodes. The important 
properties of an electrolytes are good ionic mobility, they should be also chemically inert. Another aspect is ionic conductivity, which is in the large part responsible for cell voltage lost.  
Electrolytes are usually applied in form of fluids, using water as a solvent.  
The charge transfer follows in two pathways:  
xthrough anions  – which are negative charged electrons and migrate to anode 
xthrough cations  – which are positive charged electrons and migrate to cathode 
Apart from transporting the charge, the electrolyte also plays another role: it is responsible 
for the transport of educts and products to  and from the electrodes and the products. 
Additionally, there are reactions taking place in the electrolyte itself. Last, but not least, the 
electrolytes can also act as heat exchanger. [5]  
2.2. Electrochemical reactions and reaction techniques 
During electrochemical reactions the electrodes will accept (cathode) or release (anode) the 
charge. That is the reason to call electrochemical reactions as cathodic or anodic part reactions. The total electrochemical reaction  is in charge balance neutral. In the 
electrochemistry exists the law of charge permanence: during the electrochemical reactions no charge can be lost or created.   
As an example of part reaction on the cathode and anode the water electrolysis is presented:  
Eq. 2.3:    3H
2O ĺ 21O2 + 2H 3O+ + 2e-  (anode) 
Eq. 2.4:    2H 3O+ + 2e- ĺ H2 + 2H 2O  (cathode) 
Eq. 2.5:    H 2O ĺ H2 + 21O2   (total reaction) 
As we can see from Eq. 2.3 and Eq. 2.4 at the anode the oxygen formation takes place and 
at the cathode the hydrogen will be produced. 
All of reactions in the electrolysis cell run at the phase boarder, between electrode and 
electrolyte. This reaction layer is also called ‘the double layer’. At the double layer two different phases (electrode and electrolyte) stay in the contact, so we can speak about heterogenic reaction, with physical-chemical activities. The reaction techniques describe     the whole process step by step: the chemical reaction as well as adsorption and desorption of educt and product molecules and of course electrochemical reaction with charge transfer itself. Chapter 2 –  P r i n c i p l e s  o f  e l e c t r o c h e m i s t r y                             1 0

OHP second solvatation layer [8] 
During the reaction the educts concentration drops in the reaction layer and it has to be re-
supplied from the electrolyte solution. At the same time the formed product has to be removed. That is why in electrochemical reactions, additionally the transport processes have to be considered. [5] 
2.3. Electrochemical potential and Nernst equation 
The electrochemical potential  
The contribution of an electric potential to the chemical potential is calculated by noting that 
the electrical work of adding a charge ze to the potential I is equal to Ize, and therefore   
the work per mole is FzeI, where F is Faraday’s constant, z the number of electrons and     
e the elementary charge. Because at electrochemical reactions temperature and pressure 
are constant the maximum electrical work can be identified with the change in Gibbs energy. 
The difference in chemical potential of an ion with and without the electrical potential present 
is FzI. The chemical potential of an ion in the presen ce of an electric potential is called its 
electrochemical potential P and is described with Eq. 2.6: 
Eq. 2.6:    FzIPP  
where ȝ is the chemical potential of the species when electrical potential is zero. When z = 0 
(a neutral species), the electrochemical potential is equal to the chemical one. In phases of 
variable composition, the values of the Gibbs energy, G, are determined by Eq. 2.7 [10],[11]: 
Eq. 2.7:    kkn G P¦  Chapter 2 –  P r i n c i p l e s  o f  e l e c t r o c h e m i s t r y                             1 1

Nernst equation  
The Nernst equation relates the activities of th e species involved with the electrode potential, 
E, of the half-reaction and its standard electrode potential E0, which is the value of               
the potential relative to the standard hydrogen electrode when the activities of all species are consistently. For the general half-reaction equation: 
Eq. 2.8:    X
iOxid i + ze- ĺ XiRed i 
where z is the stoichiometric number of electrons transferred for each species. Nernst 
equation is described as follows: 
Eq. 2.9:    
dOxid
iaa
zFRTEE
Re0 lnQ6 ,  
where a Oxid and a Red are the chemical activities of the redox couple. The Qi has positive 
values for products (reduced species) and negative values for reagents (oxidised species).  
An electrochemical cell is a combination of two electrodes, and one of each can be 
considered as making a characteristic contribution to the overall cell potential. To define     the standard potential E
0 of the electrode it has to be compared with a reference electrode, 
which has a stable and well-known potential. The examples of the standard reference electrodes are: the hydrogen electrode (SHE), the calomel electrode or glass electrode. 
[8],[11]   
2.4. Cell voltage and specific energy demand 
The cell voltage does not consist not only of the drop of voltage between cathode and anode 
but also of voltage losses, which are caused, amongst other, by ohm’s resistance. The cell voltage of any operating electrolysis is composed of following drops of potential:

The equilibrium potential of the cell reaction, U0,c, is determinate by the Gibbs free enthalpy 
of the cell reaction and can be calculated fairly accurately by adding the equilibrium electrode potentials E

In the praxis the simplified correlation is applied: 
Eq. 2.12:    U cell = U 0c + IaRo 
U0c could be treated as a constant, which depends o nly on the electrolytic process. On the 
other hand, Ro depends on construction details of electrolysis cell and the electrolyt’s 
character, compound, temperature, is than actually the “characteristics”  of the cell. [9] 
To define how much kWh was absorbed during an electrochemical process, the average 
voltage Ucell of the electrolysis cell has to be determined. The absorbed energy is described 
with equation  
Eq. 2.13    E w = Ia th Ucell [W] 
where Ucell is the total electrolysis cell potential , Ia is the electricity current and th is the time.      
The specific energy demand refers to the in the effect achieved amount of product at given 
current and time. It could be presented in kWh/kg or kWh/m3, depending on that if we use 
molar mass or molar volume. [9]

2.5. Ohm’s law, conductivity 
Ohm’s law describes the dependence between voltage U, resistance R and current I: 
Eq. 2.15:    RUI   [A] 
The resistance R depends on the electrolyte, amount of ions in unit of volume and their 
mobility. The resistance of a sample increases with its length l and decreases with its cross-
sectional are q: 
Eq. 2.16:    qlR U     [Ohm] 
The resistivity, U, is a property of the solution and is specific for every conductor.                 
For electrolytes it could be defined as the resistance, which is performed in fluid’s cube of 1 
cm ridge length.   
The reciprocal of resistance and resistvity is the conductance G and conductivity N. 
Therefore: 
Eq. 2.17:    lq
RGN  1  
The units of conductance are 1/ohm which is also known as the siemens S. [7],[13] 
2.6. Faraday’s laws 
The number of reactants molecules involved in an electrode reaction is related 
stoichiometrically to the number of charges (electrons) flowing in the circuit. This 
dependence is illustrated by Faraday’s laws. 
Faraday’s first law :
In electrolysis, the quantities of substance involved in the chemical change are proportional 
to the quantity of electricity which passes through electrolyte.[10]  
This definition is characterised by Eq. 2.18 
Eq. 2.18:    m = kIt = kQ where m is the mass of the substanc e altered at an electrode and  Q is the total electric 
charge passed through the substance
 
Faraday’s second law:  
The masses of different substances set free or dissolved by a given amount of electricity are 
proportional to their chemical equivalents. [10]  
is described with Eq. 2.19  Chapter 2 –  P r i n c i p l e s  o f  e l e c t r o c h e m i s t r y                             1 4
 
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________  
  
  
Eq. 2.19:    zFMQm     
where M is the molar mass of the substance and z is the valence number of ions of the 
substance. The Faraday’s constant, F, is the magnitude of the charge per mole of electrons 
and its value is calculated as following [6]:  
Eq. 2.20:  F = 1,602x10-19C x 1023/(mol e-) = 9,6485 x 104C/(mol e-) 
2.7. Current density and efficiency 
The current density presents the density of flowing charge. It is the current I, which occurs to 
the cross-section area A. 
Eq. 2.21:    AIi    [Acm-2] 
The current efficiency is calculated from the ratio of efficient deposited amount of product m eff 
to the theoretical value m th, which should be achieved.[13]

3. Principles of photochemistry 
Photochemistry comprises the chemical reactions of atoms or molecules that have been 
electronically excited by absorption of light with wavelength in the range of 200 nm to ca.  
700 nm. In a primary process, products are formed directly from the excited state of reactant (fluorescence), while products of secondary processes originate from intermediates that are formed directly from the excited state of a reactant (photosynthesis, photochemical chain reactions). It is important to consider the timescales of excited state formation and decay before describing the mechanism of photochemical reactions, as the competing with the formation of photochemical products is a host of primary photophysical processes that can deactivate the excited state. [11],[12] The most common photophysical processes are 
presented in Table 1.

3.1. Planck’s law 
Max Planck studied black-body radiation from the viewpoint of thermodynamics. He found 
out that the energy of each electromagnetic oscillator is limited to discrete values and cannot be varied arbitrarily. The limitation of energies to discrete values is called the quantisation     of energy. In particular, Planck found that he could account for the observed distribution of energy if he supposed that the permitted energies of an electromagnetic oscillator                
of frequency 
Q are integer multiples of Qh: 
Eq. 3.1:   OQch nhE   , n=0,1,2 
where h is a fundamental constant known as the Planck’s constant. The value of Q, which is 
an undetermined parameter in the theory, may be obtained by varying its value until a best fit 
is obtained. The currently accepted value for h is 6,626x10-34 Js. [11]

3.2. Photon flow 
The photon flow, )P, is the number of photons per unit time and is described with Eq. 3.2: 
Eq. 3.2:    dtdN
P )   
When the number of photons is constant over  the time, the simplified expression could be 
applied [14]: 
Eq. 3.3:    tNP
P ) [s–1].  
3.3. Lambert – Beer law 
The ratio of the transmitted intensity, I, to the incident intensity, I0, at a given frequency is 
called the transmittance, T, and is described by equation: 
Eq. 3.4:    
0IIT  
The transmitted intensity varies with the length, d, of the sample and the molar concentration, 
c, of the absorbing species in accord with the Lambert-Beer law: 
Eq. 3.5:    dcII H100 
The quantity İ is called molar absorption coefficient (formerly ‘extinction coefficienty’).        
The molar absorption coefficient depends on the frequency of the incident radiation and is greater where the absorption is most intense. 
The absorbance, A , of the sample at a given wave length is 
Eq. 3.6:    
dc TIIA    H log log0 
The Lambert-Beer law implies that the intensity of electromagnetic radiation transmitted 
through a sample at a given wave length decreases exponentially with the sample thickness and the molar concentration. [11] 
3.4. Quantum yield 
Quantum yield of a photophysical or photochemical event is a quantitive measure of           
the efficiency of this process. It is a unit-l ess constant and it c an achieve values between 
zero and one. 
Quantum yield could be defined as a  
Number n of events per unit time divided by the number of photons absorbed during this 
period [3] Chapter 3 – Principles of photochemistry                                 17

Quantum yields may depend on the wavelength of the absorbed UV/VIS radiation, but there 
are many photochemical systems, which have a constant quantum yield ) over a defined 
wavelength range. Such chemical systems can be easily used as a chemical actinometers 
(more in Chapter 6.2).

3.5. Radiant power 
Radiant power, P, also called radiant (energy) flux is generally used in sense of the „rate of 
transfer of fluid, particles or energy across a given surface“  and is presented by the  
Eq. 3.10:   tQP  
where the radiant energy, Q, is constant over the time considered. Eq. 3.10 could be also 
presented using Planck’s equation [3]: 
Eq. 3.11:   A P NchPO)  
3.6. Specific energy demand 
The specific energy demand, EEM, could be used to compare various photochemical reactors 
or different photochemical processes. It is defined as a ratio between the total amount of energy supplied to the AOP treatment system and mass unity of the pollutant. [3]

3.7. Photochemical reactions 
Photochemical reactions do not have a specific reaction order. Ground state (dark) reactions 
can run according to zero, first or second order. The kinetic behavior of a photochemical reaction depends strongly on the absorptions conditions – under total absorbance (high absorption coefficient) the decrease of the reactant concentration caused by irradiation is 
linear. In very dilute solutions under conditions with a very low absorption coefficient only       
a small fraction of the incident photon irradiance is absorbed by the reactant leading ultimately to its exponential decreases. [3] The comparison of the reaction rate constants is 
presented in Table 2. Chapter 3 – Principles of photochemistry                                 19

4. AOPs  
Advanced Oxidation Processes have become broadly applied oxidation methods in the 
waste water treatment. Although they differ from each other, AOPs could be characterised by the same chemical feature: the capability of exploiting the high reactivity of •OH radicals in driving oxidation processes in near ambient temperature and pressure. AOPs are suitable for achieving the complete abatement and for mineralisation of even less reactive pollutants.   
•OH radicals are extraordinarily reactive species, short-lived, non-selective reagents, which 
are easy to produce. The mean lifetime of •OH depends on their chemical environment and 
is estimated to be in the order of 10 micros in the presence of dissolved organic matter. The reduction potential E of •OH radicals has value •OH, H
+/H2O = 2,730 V and is one of the 
strongest oxidants (see Table 3). They attack the most part of organic molecules with very 
high rate constants usually in the order of 106–109 Mí1 sí1. [3],[16]. 
Table 3 Reduction potentials of selected oxidizing species [3] 
Oxidation species Reduction potential (V) 
Fluorine F•/F 3,600 
Hydroxyl radical •OH, H+/H2O 2,730 
Sulfate radical SO 4•-/SO 42- 2,430 
Chlorine radicals Cl•/Cl- 2,200 – 2,600 
Ozone, O 3, H+/H2O 2,07 
Hydrogen peroxide, H 2O2, H+/H2O 1,77 
 
As the hydroxyl radicals are so reactive and unstable, they must be continuously produced 
by means of photochemical or chemical reactions, which are listed below: 
xH2O2/Fe2+    (Fenton) 
xH2O2/Fe3+    (Fenton-like) 
xH2O2/ Fe2+ (Fe3+)/UV   (photo assisted Fenton) 
xTiO 2/hv/O 2    (photocatalysis) 
xO3/H2O2    (PEROXON-process)  
xO3/UV     (UVOX-method)  
xH2O2/UV     (UV-PEROX-method) [16]  
xelectrochemical •OH production (electrochemical oxidation)  
Another important aspect concerning the opportunity of AOPs’ application is chemical 
oxygen demands. Only wastes with relatively small COD contents ( d5.0 g/l) can be suitably 
treated since higher concentrations would require the consumption of too large amounts of expensive reactants.
 [16], [25] 
Next chapters include more detailed description of some existing AOPs. Chapter 4 –  A O P s                                         21

4.1. Photo – induced oxidation reactions 
Oxidation processes driven by UV/VIS radiation are called photooxidation reactions. Photo-
induced oxidations, such as photoionization of molecules M are induced by absorption of electromagnetic radiation. Ejection of an electron from the electronically excited substrate 
molecule M* into the surrounding medium leads to the formation of radical cation (M•+), which 
is presented in Eq. 4.1 
Eq. 4.1:    M + Qh ĺ M* ĺ M•+ + e- 
Usually, photo-induced oxidation reactions include reactions of a substance M with oxygen 
under the influence of UV/VIS radiation. In this case, the photooxidation is induced by electronic excitation of the substrate M, from which the electron transfer to ground state molecular oxygen takes place. [3] This reaction could be described as following: 
                   O
2 
  P  
Eq. 4.2:   M + Qh ĺ M* ĺ Products 
4.2. Photolysis of aqueous hydrogen peroxide 
Photolysis of aqueous hydrogen peroxide in the UV-C range represents one of the easiest 
ways of producing a sufficient amount of hy droxyl radicals. The general photochemical 
reaction is described by Eq. 4.3: 
Eq. 4.3:    H 2O2 + Qh ĺ H2O2* ĺ 2 •OH 
The major drawback of this process is the small molar extinction coefficient of H 2O2 which    
is only 18.6 Mí1 cmí1 at 254 nm. This means that only a relative small fraction of incident light 
is therefore exploited in particular in the cases where organic substrates will act as inner filters. The rate of photolysis of aqueous H
2O2 depends on pH-value and increases when 
more alkaline conditions are used [1]. This could be caused by higher molar absorption coefficient of the peroxide anion HO
2í which at 254 nm is 240 Mí1 cmí1. [1], [16]  
Hydroxyl radicals can oxidise organic and inorganic substrates by different types of reactions 
like those presented in Eq. 4.4 - Eq. 4.6. [1]  
Eq. 4.4:  •OH+ Mn  ĺ Mn+1 + (OH-)aq    (electron transfer) 
Eq. 4.5:  •OH+ R-H ĺ R + H 2O    (hydrogen abstraction) 
Eq. 4.6:  •OH+ R 2C=CR 2 ĺ CR 2=C(OH)R 2   (electrophilic addition)Chapter 4 –  A O P s                                         22

4.3. AEOPs 
Advanced Electrochemical Oxidation Processes are based on the production of hydroxyl 
radicals ( •OH) from water oxidation on the surface of a high O 2-overvoltage anode and/or 
from Fenton’s reaction between added Fe2+ and hydrogen peroxide electrogenerated at the 
cathode. There are two possibilities of AEOP reactions: 
xdirect oxidation on the anode 
xindirect process with application of strong oxidation compounds [5], [16] 
4.3.1. Direct oxidation 
The aim of direct oxidation is total mineralisation of the organic molecules to CO 2 and H 2O. 
This is possible because of the reaction of organics with adsorbed hydroxyl radical ( •OH) ads, 
which is formed at the anode from water oxidation. The adsorbed radicals react with organic compounds R and result in CO
2 and H 2O formation. The whole reaction process could be 
described as follows: 
Eq. 4.7:    2H 2O ĺ •OH ads + H 3O+ + e- 
Eq. 4.8:    M + •OH ads ĺ M(•OH) ads 
Eq. 4.9:    R + M( •OH) ads ĺ M + mCO 2 + nH 2O 
The whole oxidation reaction is described with following general scheme: Eq. 4.10:  C
mHnOl + (2m – 1) H 2O ĺ m CO2 + (4m + n – 2l) H+ + (4m + n – 2l)e- 
According to Eq. 4.10 the theoretical amount of needed electrons could be calculated with 
following equation: 
Eq. 4.11:    z theor = 4m + n – 2l 
The mechanism of oxidative decomposition is in fact much more complicated. The reaction 
sequence leading to the formation of CO 2 rests upon gradual charge of electrons to             
the electrode runs in many elementary reactions and formation of adsorbed intetrmediates.  
Direct oxidation can be run only at high anodic potentials, when •OH radicals are generated 
with simultaneous oxygen evolution, thus producing regeneration of the anode surface.  
The oxidation processes are usually held in acid electrolytes as the solubility of CO 2 is in that 
case much lower than in basic range and CO 2 could be removed as a gas from                   
the electrolyte. [5], [16]   
4.3.2. Indirect electrooxidation methods 
In the last years potent indirect electrooxidation methods have been developed. They involve 
continuous supply of hydrogen peroxide to the contaminated solutions. The oxidant is generated in acid medium from the two-electron reduction of O
2 (see Chapter 2.2).             Chapter 4 –  A O P s                                         23
 
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________  
  
  
The oxidation power of hydrogen peroxide is often enhanced by addition of Fe2+ what allows 
to formation of •OH radicals (so-called Fenton’s reaction). 
Eq. 4.12:   Fe2+ + H 2O2 ĺ Fe3+ + •OH + OH- 
In a photoelectro-Fenton reaction, the solution is also irradiated with UV light of                  
Ȝmax = 360 nm to try to accelerate the mineralisation process by the photolysis of the complex 
of Fe3+ with some intermediates and/or by the enhancement of the rate of Fe2+ regeneration 
from additional photoreduction of Fe3+ species, such as Fe(OH)2+, via photo-Fenton    
reaction [16]:

5.1.1. General description 
EDTA refers to the chelating agent, which is widely used to sequester di- and trivalent metal 
ions (for example Ca2+ and Mg2+). Those metals ions are bound via four carboxylate and two 
amine groups. Examples of especially strong EDTA complexes are: with Mn(II), Cu(II), Fe(III), Pb (II) and Co(III). EDTA strongly chelates also radioactive plutonium and 
radioisotopes of Am
3+, Cm3+ and TH4+, which are then vastly more mobile than the 
unchelated metal ions. 
EDTA is the most abundant anthropogenic compound in many European surface waters 
because of its widespread use in many industries and its slow removal - EDTA is not degraded or removed during conventional wastewater treatment. EDTA concentration           in European rivers is reported between 10-100 ȝg/l, and in lakes between 1-10 ȝg/l.

Complexing agents in wastewater are of great concern in last times, because of their ability 
to solubilize heavy metals from plumbing, deposits containing heavy metals or other waste disposal sites. What is more, chelating agents may be a factor in determining algal growth.  
A further problem is, that chelating agents are nontoxic to many forms of life on acute 
exposure; however the effects of longer-term low-level exposure are unknown. In laboratory tests on animals EDTA has been found to be both cytotoxic and weakly genotoxic. [17], [18], 
[19]  
5.1.2. Common application 
The most important uses of EDTA are: 
xIndustrial cleaning  -complexation of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions, binding of heavy metals 
xDetergents - complexation of Ca2+ and Mg2+: reduction of water hardness 
xPhotography  - use of Fe(III)-EDTA as oxidizing agent. 
xPulp and paper industry  - complexation of heavy metal ions during chlorine-free 
bleaching, stabilization of hydrogen peroxide. 
xTextile industry  - complexation of heavy metal ions, bleach stabilizer. 
xAgrochemicals  - Fe, Zn and Cu fertilizer, especially in calcareous soils. 
xHydroponics  - iron-EDTA is used to solubilize iron in nutrient solutions. 
More specialised uses of EDTA: 
xFood  - added as preservative to prevent catalytic oxidation by metal ions or stabilizer 
and for iron fortification. 
xPersonal care  - added to cosmetics to improve product stability.[6] 
xFlue gas cleaning  - removal of NO x. 
xRecycling  - recovery of lead from used lead acid batteries. 
xMedicin:  chelation therapy, an anticoagulant for blood samples, in dentistry as a root 
canal irrigant, iron removal from the body in the disease thalassemia

5.2. Direct anodic EDTA oxidation 
Direct anodic oxidation is a well-known method of EDTA mineralisation. A lot of 
investigations were done according to this subject, especially with application of diamond electrodes. [20],[21] Some experiments done by Zelenka were carried out also with the use 
of titan electrode laminated with iridium oxide as an anode and glassy carbon as cathode
 
material. [22] The best results were achieved at a current density of 20 A/m2 at the anode, 
pH = 4,9 and temperature of 25 oC. 
The EDTA has four different dissociation levels, which influence the dissociation grades.   
The selection of the optimal pH range is very important for the direct EDTA oxidation process. According to the pH–value the EDTA follows one of the dissociation level curves, which are presented at Figure 5.1.

5.3. Photochemistry of the Fe(III)–EDTA complexes 
As it was mentioned in Chapter 5.1, EDTA builds a very stable complex with many metal 
ions. The Fe(III)-EDTA-complex is stable in the range of pH-value between 1...8,5 and Fe(III)-EDTA-complex between 2...12,5. The stable constant of FE(III) is equal to       
K
Fe(III)EDTA = 1,3 x 1025. [26] 
The decomposition of Fe(III)-EDTA or EDTA under UV radiation was investigated and the 
degradation scheme presents Figure 5.2. Chapter 5 –  A O P s  a s  a n  i n s t r u m e n t  o f  E D T A  d e g r a d a t i o n                                          2 7

(left) and absence of Fe2+, Fe3+ (right).The arrows represent the reaction paths to identified (– Źc) and 
to not identified (--- Źc) degradation products. [23] 
During the decomposition reaction of Fe(III)-EDTA complex, it is reduced to the dimer 
intermediate Fe(II)-ED3A. This reaction could be explained with Ligand to Metal Charge Chapter 5 –  A O P s  a s  a n  i n s t r u m e n t  o f  E D T A  d e g r a d a t i o n                                          2 8

Transfer Reaction (LMCT), where the electron from Ligands (Acetatgroup) is transferred to 
Fe(III) and reduced it to Fe(II). 
According to the laboratory conditions: 
a) in deoxygenated media the innersphere electron is transferred to the Fe(III) centre 
yields Fe(II) species and EDTA oxidation products, or 
b)  in aerated or oxygenated media the outersphere two-electron are transferred to O 2, 
what results in fast oxidation of the dangling CH 2COO• group to CO 2 and HCHO, with 
the concerted regeneration of the Fe(III) in form of Fe(III)-ED3A and the parent complex [24] 
The whole process presents Figure 5.3.

and oxygenated (ii) solutions of Fe(III)-EDTA(H 2O). [24] 
 
According to the investigation done by Gangl [26] with a low pressure lamp ( Ȝ = 254 nm)     
the best results of Fe(III)-EDTA mineralisation could be achieved while using Fe(II)-EDTA as an output solution instead of Fe(III)-EDTA at the ratio of c
Fe(III):cEDTA = 1:2, start pH-value 
under 3 and aeration with 8,3 mg/l. The reaction rate constant k at those circumstances was 
equal to 0,061 M-min. Chapter 5 –  A O P s  a s  a n  i n s t r u m e n t  o f  E D T A  d e g r a d a t i o n                                          2 9

5.4. Anox/H 2O2cath/UV 
AEOPs in EDTA mineralization were investigated in many combination forms by Gangl [26] 
and by Zelenka [22]. One of them was the conjunction of direct anodic oxidation of EDTA 
with hydrogen peroxide generation on the cathode and its irradiation with ultraviolet radiation. This method is therefore particular, that usually extra dosed H
2O2 is in this case produced     
in situ  from the exceed oxygen amount from anode reaction and it is built on the glassy coal.    
In this case EDTA will decompose according to three processes: direct anodic oxidation, EDTA- photolysis and H
2O2/UV processes. 
Both Gangl and Zelenka studied EDTA decomposition with application of 15 W low pressure 
lamp and the Na 2EDTA solution with concentration of 1,34 mM but with different output      
pH-values and current densities. The results achieved by Gangl at pH start = 3, j an = 85 A/m2 
and j cath = 64 A/m2 have shown almost completely degradation of EDTA (95%) after            
180 minutes. In case of investigation done by Zelenka with pH start = 5, j an = 20 A/m2 and            
jcath = 0,49 A/m2 this effect was achieved after 350 minutes.  Chapter 6 –  R e a c t o r  c h a r a c t e r i s t i c                                          3 0

6. Reactor characteristic 
6.1. The residence time distribution 
In ideal flow patterns, the average time needed by a particle to pass through the reactor is 
called mean residence time and is equal to the space-time. 
Eq. 6.1: x  
VVtRW   
Deviation from the ideal flow patterns could be caused by: 
xchanneling of fluid 
xrecycling of fluid 
xshort-circuit 
xstagnant regions in the vessel [27],[28] 
Because of all disruptions mentioned above, elements of fluid in non-ideal flows take 
different routes through the reactor and different lengths of time to pass through the vessel. 
The distribution of these times for the stream of fluid leaving the reactor is called the residence time distribution (RTD) and could be described with the exit age distribution curve E with units of time 
–1. However one restriction on the E curve has to be taken into account, 
which concerns closed vessel boundary condition. This means that the fluid enters and leaves the vessel only one time. [27] The exit age distribution E could be defined as              
a probability of the volume element, which entered the reactor in the moment t = 0, to leave 
the vessel in time interval between t and t+dt. After endless long time the probability is equal 
to 1 as all of particles have left the reactor. 
Eq. 6.2:
    ³f
 
01dttE  
To obtain a non-dimensional residence time, E(t) curve is represented in such a way that the 
area under the curve is unity and the residence time is normalised into the form of ș. [28] 
Eq. 6.3    WTt  
According to Figure 6.1 the fraction of exit stream of age between t and t+dt is Edt, the 
fraction younger than age t1 is ³1

Figure 6.1 The exit age distribution curve E also called the residence time distribution (RTD) [27]  
The residence time cumulative curve F(t) in continuous flow systems describes, which 
volume fraction at the exiting fluid flow has the residence time between 0 and t. In other words F(t) relates to the probability of the volume element, which in the moment t = 0 entered 
the reactor and left it in a period between 0 and t. If at the moment t = 0 there are no particles 
in the reactor and after endless long time none of the particles remain in the reactor following equations is true: 
Eq. 6.5:

The differential of the residence time cumulative curve gives the fraction of the fluid, which 
leaves reactor between t and t+dt, what relate exactly to residence distribution function E(t).

Figure 6.2 Determining the mean residence time from cumulative curve F(t) [29] 
The integral from equation Eq. 6.8 relates to hatched area in Figure 6.2 and also to mean 
residence time t. Both of the areas: A1 and A2 have to be equal size. 
6.1.1. Experimental determination of RTD 
The simplest and most direct way of determining the residence time distribution in non-ideal 
reactors is to use a physical non-reactive tracer, which is inert into the fluid flowing through the reactor. The concentration of the tracer is measured at the reactor’s exit and compared with its entering value. The examples of tracers are: a colour tracer, acid, leach or a salt solution. The measured attributes except the concentration of the trace could also be conductivity, absorption or radiation. [27],[28] 
The most common methods to characterise RTD of a reactor are the pulse or the step 
experiment. Below the step input method is described as it was applied in RTD investigation. 
Step input methode
 
At a time t = 0 ordinary fluid with known flow rate passing through the reactor is switched into 
fluid with tracer with given concentration cmax. With the time t > 0 the tracer concentration 
measured at the reactor’s exit cStep will be becoming closer to the value of cmax and after 
endless time cS will be equal to cmax.

6.2. Iodite/iodate actinometer 
The chemical actinometer is the most common method in radiation measurements.              
By means of various chemical substances it could be applied in wavelength range of        130-770 nm. To describe the photon flow in reactors a method from Rahn was applied, where an iodide/iodate solution was used as a chemical actinometer. [30]
 
The iodide/iodate chemical actinometer is intended for low-pressure mercury lamp that puts 
out more than 85% of its energy at wavelength of 254 nm. The solution is made of 0,6 M iodide (KI) and 0,1 M calium iodate (KIO
3) and 0,01 M borate buffer (Dinatriumtetraborat, 
Na2B4O7* 10H 2O). Iodate acts as an electron scavanger and borate as a buffer which holds 
pH-value at the level of 9,25. Irradiation results in the formation of triiodate, which is than 
quantified by measuring its absorbance at 352 nm.  
6.2.1. Absorption spectra 
At Figure 6.4 the absorption spectra of potassium iodide (a), potassium iodate (b) and the 
mixture of both (c) are compared before (–UV) and after (+UV) irradiation with a germicidal lamp. Chapter 6 –  R e a c t o r  c h a r a c t e r i s t i c                                          3 4

Figure 6.4: Absorption spectras [30] 
The chemical actinometer solution is optically opaque at the wavelength of O 254 nm and 
shows neglible/very low absorbance value over O 330. In other words, iodide/iodate mixture 
should absorb all light below 290 nm and none above 330 nm. Such a spectra is very 
favorable for actinometer experiment’s run as the solution is very stable at day light.  
After irradiation the absorption spectra of the mixture shows its maximum at O 352 nm, 
what causes the formation of triiodide. This wavelength was used in further experiments to 
define triiodide concentration.  
6.2.2. Reaction mechanism 
After irradiation of actinometer solution with UV-light the charge transfer [I-H2O*] would be 
formed. 
Eq. 6.12:    I ¯ + H 2O + hv  ĺ  I-H2O* 
The charge transfer state relaxes to a caged complex containing an iodine atom and            
an electron. 
Eq. 6.13:   I-H2O* ĺ (I•,e¯) + H 2O  
From the caged complex [I•,e-] two different processes can take place. The first one is a back 
reaction to reform iodide. The second possibility is a breakdown of the caged complex and 
the migration of the electron out of the cage and into the bulk solution where it is free to react as an aqueous electron. So after photon abso rption iodine atoms and a solvated electron are 
formed. Chapter 6 –  R e a c t o r  c h a r a c t e r i s t i c                                          3 5
 
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________  
  
  
Eq. 6.14:   I ¯  + hv = I• + e aq¯   
The total reaction is given by Eq. 6.15: 
Eq. 6.15 :   8I¯ + IO 3¯ + H 2O + h·v ĺ  3I 3¯ + 6OH¯ 
6.2.3. Quantum yield 
According to investigation done by Rahn [30], the quantum yield depends on the temperature 
of the solution, the radiation wavelength and the concentration of potassium iodide. At the 
temperature of T = 20,7 oC, a wavelength of O 254 and a potassium concentration of         
cKI = 0,6 M the quantum yield is equal to )254nm = 0,75 ± 0,02. A precise expression, 
considering dependence of temperature and concentration is given by Eq. 6.16 :   
Eq. 6.16:  )O = 0,75 [1 + 0,02 (T – 20,7)]*[1 + 0,23 (C – 0,577)]  
Evaluation of triiodide concentration  
The concentration of triiodide could be evaluated from the absorbance measurement in         
a spectrophotometer at the wavelength of 352 nm. Using the Lambert-Beer law, the calculation follows Eq. 6.17, where A is the absorbance value, d [cm] is the irradiative cuvette 
length, 
Hҏ is the molar extinction coefficient and S is the dilution factor.

Evaluation of the photon flow and the radiant power  
The photo irradiance could be described in other words as a ratio of created triiodide moles 
at the certain reactor volume and within a certain time to its quantum yield. The evaluation in batch reactors is given by Eq. 3.8 and in PFRs by Eq. 3.9. The radiant power could be 
calculated with Planck’s law equation Eq. 3.11. 
6.3. Electrochemical hydrogen peroxide generation  
Usually hydrogen peroxide is produced by electrochemical methods, such as electrolysis of 
inorganic chemicals and autooxidation of organic compounds. However, for those processes non-aqueous solvents for catalysts cycle are required.  
H
2O2 can also be generated directly from water, hydrogen and oxygen using thermal, 
photochemical or electrical discharge processes. Most of the hydrogen peroxide           electro-generation processes are conducted in alkaline solutions with a high electrolyte 
concentration. Considering further using of H
2O2 in electro-Fenton processes  (see Chapter 4) 
the optimal pH range would be found between 2,5...3,5. There are reports, which prove, that hydrogen peroxide can be electrochemically produced by reduction of dissolved oxygen at Chapter 6 –  R e a c t o r  c h a r a c t e r i s t i c                                          3 6

the cathode. In acidic solutions, the dissolved oxygen is electrochemically reduced with two 
electrons to hydrogen peroxide at the cathode. [31] 
Eq. 6.18:   O 2 + 2H+ + 2e¯ ĺ H2O2, E0 = 0,44 V vs SCE 
At the anode, the oxidation of water leads to formation of oxygen gas and protons. Eq. 6.19:   2H
2O ĺ 4H+ + O 2 + 4e¯,   E0 = 0,987 V vs SCE 
The protons will be driven to the catholyt electrostatically and partially supply the protons 
consumption during the synthesis of H 2O2. 
Except Eq. 6.18 two other reactions can occur simultaneously at the cathode. One of them is 
the reduction of H 2O2 to H 2O according to Eq. 6.20: 
Eq. 6.20:   H 2O2 + 2H+ + 2e ĺ 2 H 2O, E0 = 1,534 V vs SCE 
The second reaction could be the hydrogen gas evolution. Eq. 6.21:   2H
+ + 2e ĺ H2,  E0 = -0,242 V vs SCE 
According to the investigation done by Qiang, Chang and Huang [31], the optimal conditions 
for hydrogen peroxide generation are at cathodic potential of –0,5 V (vs. SCE), oxygen mass 
flow rate of 8,2 x10-2 mol/min, pH 2 and average current efficiency of 6,4 A/m2. In case of 
using air instead of oxygen, the average current density decreases to 2,1 A/m2. H 2O2 
production is favoured at low temperatures in range of 10...20 0C, as with higher temperature 
and also pH value the self-decomposition rate is growing. [31] On the other hand, 
experiments run by Gangl gave the best results in alkaline solutions. [26]  Chapter 7 –  E x p e r i m e n t a l  p a r t                                          3 7

7.1.1. UV-VIS spectrometry 
UV-VIS spectrometry measures the intensity of an absorption of a monochromatic radiation 
across a range of wavelengths passing through a solution. The absorbance is proportional to the number of absorbing species in the illuminated sample and is described with       Lambert-Beer law (see: Chapter 3.3) 
A spectrometer is composed of polychromatic broad spectrum sources, dispersive units, 
sample cells, detectors and a computer for data manipulation and storage. 
In the laboratory test a double beam Thermo Scientific Helios
TM Zeta (Omega)  
spectrophotometer with the dual-source tungsten and deuterium lamp system was used. Such a light source allows maximum performance over the wavelength range of                190...1100 nm with accuracy of ± 1.0 nm. The photometric range of absorption expands between –0,3...3,0 A and the measurement accuracy at 1 A is equal to 0,005 A. Measurements of absorbance could have been read from an integrated active display or transferred through a built-in USB interface and stored on the PC and controlled via the VISION lite
TM software. [32],[33],[34]

7.1.2. Hydrogen peroxide analytical determination 
In acid solution hydrogen peroxide reacts with potassium iodide according to the equation: 
Eq. 7.1:    H 2O2 + 2 I- + 2 H+ ĺ I2 + 2 H 2O 
To determinate hydrogen peroxide concentration 10 ml potassium iodide with concentration 
of 0,2 M was added to the sample bottles, acidulated with 2 ml of 1 M sulphuric acid and weighed. After that, a 10 ml sample with unknown hydrogen peroxide content was dosed into the probe under continuous mixing of potassium iodide solution and after that scaled again. Thus prepared probes were put away for one hour until the whole reaction had been completed: the solution’s colour had changed to deep yellow. Finally, the samples were titrated with 0,01 M sodium thiosulphate until the solution became colourless again. According to the reaction: 
Eq. 7.2:   I
2 + Na 2S2O3 ĺ 2 NaI + Na 2S4O6  
and knowing that 1 ml of 0,01 M Na 2S4O6 = 0,17007 mg H 2O2, the hydrogen peroxide 
concentration could be calculated from titrated amount of sodium thiosulphate. [35] 
7.2. HPLC analysis 
The EDTA concentration was determined using a HPLC analysis, which was curried out an 
external department. The result were achieved in a form of reports, like the one presented in 
Figure 7.1. The data from the reports was used for further calculations. 
High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is a form of column chromatography used 
frequently in analytical chemistry to separate, identify, and quantify compounds. The principle of liquid chromatography is based on the passage of the constituents to be separated between two immiscible phases. For this, the sample is dissolved in a liquid mobile phase and moved across stationary phase – column. Due to the interactions of the constituents with stationary phase they separate after sufficient running time.  
Main principles of the separation are: 
xadsorption 
xdistribution 
xion exchange 
xexclusion 
The components of a classical unit  for liquid chromatography are: 
xan elution medium reservoir containing the solvent for the mobile phase 
xa separation column made of glass tube typically with an inner diameter of 1 cm and 
a length of 30 cm 
xa syringe or an injection valve to feed in the sample solution 
xa fraction collector with which a few millimetres of the eluate are collected manually or 
automatically [36] Chapter 7 –  E x p e r i m e n t a l  p a r t                                          3 9

7.4. Experimental setup 
7.4.1. UV-radiation source 
As an UV-radiation source a low pressure mercury lamp from Heraeus  was used with power 
output of 35 W and maximum emission at O = 254 nm. Irradiance at that wavelength 
achieves 0,06 mW/cm2 at the distance of 100 cm and a typical UV-radiation efficiency is 
located at about 40%. An ambient temperature of working UV radiator should not extend range of 10...30 
oC, that is why during the experiments the lamp was kept in glass cooling 
coat filled with water, which was held by thermostat at a constant temperature of 25 oC. As    
a power supply for low pressure mercury lamp EPS 1/1.2/2/4 device was used. [37],[38]

7.4.2. Chemical reactors 
In laboratory tests four different reactors were used. All of them were fabricated from 
borosilicate according to VTU drawings. Three of those reactors were plug flow reactors and one of them was a continuous stirredt-tank reactor, sometimes used also as a batch reactor. 
Figure 7.5 presents the scheme of two plug flow reactors, which had namely the same 
shape, but different reactor volume. During experiments an UV lamp was immersed in the reactors from the upper side, the rear side was capped with a gas frit plug.

At Figure 7.6 the coil reactor is presented. It consisted of 3 parts, combined togehther with PVC tubes. During experiments the UV-lamp was attached inside the coil reactor, up to the cooling coat inlets.

At Figure 7.7 the continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) scheme and photo are displayed. 
What is not visible at the drawing, but only on the photo, are the three inlets located in the lower part of the reactor and one placed in the middle. In those inlets the measuring instruments could have been fixed, enabling using the CSTR not only as an UV-reactor, but also as a tank for outlet solutions. During the experiments the solution entered through upper inlet and left out through the lower inlet. The solution in the reactor was mixed with a stirrer, usually with the speed of 250 rmp (descritption of the mixing device: Chapter 7.4.8). In the 
experiments with photochemical Fe(II)-EDTA degradation (see Chapter 9.2) and during the 
determination of photon flow (see Chapter 1.1.1) the reactor was applied as a batch reactor.

A specially designed EC Electro MP-Cell  was tested as an electrolysis cell. Electro MP-Cell  
is a small multipurpose plate-and-frame cell, the general scheme of it is shown below. (a) (b) Chapter 7 –  E x p e r i m e n t a l  p a r t                                          4 6

a cathode - glassy carbon SIGRADUR® K,  located before a high quality steel plate which 
served as an electric current connector. T he space between the plates with the dimensions 
of: 6 x 16 x 2,5 cm was filled with 147 g of glassy carbon with a diameter of 3150...4000 ȝm 
and density of 1,54 g/cm2. Taking average diameter of the particle into calculations, the 
active area of the cathode was equal to 0,147 m2. The original ion selective membrane was 
replaced with granulate backing fence, which allowed a free flow of electrolyte between the  electrodes. [39],[40]

7.4.4. Elelectrolysis cell power supply unit 
As an electrolysis cell current source a Bolz electronic TG30-2T  power supply unit was 
applied. The instrument could work at a constant output voltage with a range between     0...30 V or with a constant output current between 0...2 A. [41] 
7.4.5. Circulation flow in bench scale unit 
In the laboratory tests a WASON-MARLOW Bredel 323Du/D  tube pump with 3 roller pump-
head was used to distribute solution in the bench scale unit. The possible speed range of the 
pump expanded between 3...400 rpm what responded to solution’s flow rate of 0,3...24 l/h.  In the pump-head a rubber tube was installed, the rest of the tubes used in the bench scale unit were PVC hose. [42] 
7.4.6. pH- and conductivity measurement 
The pH-value, the conductivity and the temperature in the solution were measured by            
a Thermo Scientific Orion 5-Star Plus  portable multi-parameter. A gel-filled (Ag/AgCl) 
pH/ATC Triode TM with an built-in thermostat for Automatic Temperature Compensation 
(ATC) was used as the pH electrode. The pH-value range extended between 1...14 and the temperature range between 0...90 
oC. For a conductivity electrode a DuraProbeTM                
4-Electrode Conductivity Cells (013010MD) was chosen with recommended application 
range of 1 μS/cm...200 mS/cm and a cell constant of 0,475 cm-1. [43] 
7.4.7. Temperature monitoring 
To ensure comprehensible laboratory conditions the temperature in the solution was kept at 
the same level with use of a thermostatic circulator LAUDA Ecoline Staredition E 206  with      
a working temperature range of 20...100 °C and a temperature control of ± 0,01 °C.           The heater power was working with 2,25 kW and the pressure pump could achieve                a maximal pressure of 0,4 bar and a flow of 17 l/min. [44]
 
7.4.8. Mixing device 
To mix the solution in the CTSR a Heidolph® MR Hei-Standard  Magnetic Hot Plate Stirrer
was used, with the plate diameter equal to 145 mm. The possible speed range was situated between 100...1400 rotation per minute, an excellent stirring results could have been achieved with volumes up to 20 liters of water. [45]

8. Experimental results – reactors’ characterisation 
8.1. Residence time distribution in reactors 
Residence time distribution in the reactors was measured with a step input method as it 
carried fewer technical problems. A colour medium was used as a mark tracer fluid and the residence time distribution was shown as a change of its concentration in the solution.       The colour medium content in flowing solution was determined with absorbance value, which measured in a spectrophotometer at the exit of the reactor. 
8.1.1. RTD investigation characteristic 
Diluted food colouring produced by Schimek® was used as a fluid tracer. Its density was 
equal to 0,1 g/l and the mean absorbance varied between 0,18...0,2 A at the wavelength of 500 nm. The absorbance of the fluid was defined with a Thermo Scientific Helios
TM Zeta 
spectrophotometer. A glass flow cuvette fixed with tubes coming from the reactor enabled 
continuous measurement of fluid absorbance. The data were automatically record on a PC and controlled from the VISION lite
TM software at 4 seconds interval. The minimal interval of            
4 seconds was the program’s limit and could not be changed. Because of the small volume of the coil reactor and its RTD situated below 60 seconds the data had to be recorded manually from main device display which was able to show diagrams with minimal 1 second interval. These limitations could interfere with the accuracy of the RTD measurement data. Another problem related to the measurements’ registration were air bubbles that sometimes changed the real value of fluid absorbance in the cuvette, especially at very low flow rates like 3 l/h.
 
As the construction of the experiment enabled a continuous measurement only at the exit from the reactor, the tracer absorbance value was checked before every start of the experiment to identify the tracer concentration. A fter that, the reactor was filled up with water 
coming from a 2-liter storage tank with a specific flow rate. As the reactor filled up, the water flow turned into the tracer flow coming from the second storage tank. Both tanks were connected with a cock, which allowed an easy regulation of the water and tracer flow.

Figure 8.1: Experimental setup at residence time distribution tests in the CSTR 
The residence time distribution was measured in all reactors and also in the electrolysis cell 
with different flow rates: 3l/h; 6 l/h; 10 l/h; 15 l/h; 20 l/h. As a cathod a glassy carbon was used, which was located before steel plate. It  caused considerable pressure losses and 
made a solution flow under value of 10 l/h not possible. Lower flow rates passed only through the anode tube system, the cathode tube system was filled with water and remained in balance. That was the reason to measure RTD of electrolysis cell at the 10 l/h, till                the maximal possible pump flow rate of 24 l/h.  
To prove reproducibility of the investigations all measurements of every reactor and every 
flow rate were done twice. The obtained values in both experimental runs were nearly the same, what confirms comparability of the tests. 
In the investigation all four reactors, described in 7.4.2, were used. The electrolysis cell was 
also analysed, however it cannot be considered as a type of reactor because of its specific construction.  
8.1.2. RTD in the coil reactor 
The RTD in the coil reactor showed the smallest variation from an ideal step tracer F curve. 
Figure 8.1 presents the RTD in the coil reactor at different flow rates. At 15 l/h the F(t) curve 
grew rapidly, reaching the value of F(t) = 0,98 after 7 seconds. The mean RTD, calculated 
using Eq. 6.11 was equal to 3,7 seconds. At a flow rate of 10 l/h, the F(t) value of 0,97 was 
reached after 11 seconds and the mean RTD was equal to 5,4 seconds. At the other two flow mark tracer

rates the F curve started to bend. The value of F(t)=0,97 was reached after 20 seconds at 
the flow of 6 l/h and at 3 l/h after 46 seconds. The mean RTD was accordingly equal to     11,0 and 23,2 seconds. The F(t) curve run showed no irregularities at any of the flow rates.

8.1.3. RTD in PFRs 
The RTD measurement of the PFRs were carried out with an immersed UV lamp to reflect 
the same laboratory conditions as those held by EDTA degradation test. The trace solution 
was pumped from the storage tank into the bottom inlet of the PFRs and the outlet took place through upper inlet. The volume of water to fill the small PFR was equal to 113 ml and by the large one 345 ml. 
Figure 8.2 presents the results from the RTD tests in the small PFR. As the volume of the 
reactor is small also the RTD is short: the F(t) curve reached 0,97 value after 57 second at    
a flow rate of 20 l/h, at 15 l/h after 80 seconds. The same amount of F(t) = 0,97 was recorded 
after 108 second at 10 l/h and 184 seconds at 6 l/h. The flow rate of 3l/h needed 340 seconds to achieve the same level. Chapter 8 – Experimental results – reactors’ characterisation                                         51

Figure 8.3: F(t) curves obtained from step tracer experiments done in small PFR at different flow rates 
The mean RTD numbers are much greater than those from coil reactor. The highest flow rate 
brought a value equal to 17,3 seconds, the lowest a value of 148,1 seconds. The tracer moving with 15 l/h yield to a value of 24,7 seconds and a flow rate of 10 l/h 44,1 seconds.    At 6 l/h the mean RTD was equal to 84,2 seconds. No irregularities in the F(t) curves run 
were noticed. 
The volume of the large PFR was twice greater than the small one and as a consequence 
the mean RTD values had also higher values. At the flow rate of 20 l/h the mean RTD was equal to 52,6 seconds, at 15 l/h – 70,3 seconds. The run of the F(t) curve at those flow rates 
was relatively similar and up to a value of F(t) = 0,9 it raised rapidly. The value of 0,9 was 
reached in 92 seconds at the greatest flow rate, at 15 l/h it needed 124 seconds. The F(t) 
curve at the flow rate of 10 l/h was no more steep and approached the point of 0,9 in          196 seconds. At 6 l/h the tracer concentration was growing gently to reach F(t) = 0,9 after 
380 seconds. The mean RTD values of those flow rates were accordingly: 115,5 and      
199,3 seconds. As Figure 8.4 presents, the run of the F(t) curve at the lowest flow rate 
showed some irregularities, which were partly a c onsequence of air b ubbles in the solution 
flow. After the first tracer answer (100 seconds) the curve raised rapidly up to the value of 
0,52 (152 seconds) and after that fell down a little bit under F(t)=0,5 and started raising again 
up till maximum, but in a very gentle way. The mean RTD of that flow was equal to 344 seconds. Chapter 8 – Experimental results – reactors’ characterisation                                         52

Figure 8.4: F(t) curves obtained from step tracer experiments done in large PFR at different flow rates 
A flow rate of 6 l/h with its F(t) curve was more alike RTD run in the CSTR rather than in 
PFR. This situation could be explained by extremely small flow rate in comparison to large 
reactor volume. 
8.1.4. RTD in the CSTR 
RTD measurements in the CSTR caused some problems. Because of the UV lamp, immersed in the reactor during the tests, an adequate tightness between those two elements could not be assured. That led to the fluctuation of the fluid lev el in the CSTR at the flow rate 
of 20 l/h and enabled to run the experiment at this rate. On the other hand at the speed of        3 l/h, air bubbles disturbed the spectrophotometer measurement, causing abrupt jumps of the absorbance value.  
The solution was pumped from the storage tank into the CSTR through the upper inlet, than 
it was mixed in the reactor with a speed of 250 rpm and left the reactor through the lower inlet (for the reactor setup see Chapter 7.4.2). Figure 8.5 shows the F(t) curves recorded at 
the RTD tests in the CSTR. Chapter 8 – Experimental results – reactors’ characterisation                                         53

Figure 8.5: F(t) curves obtained from step tracer experiments done in CSTR at different flow rates 
In this case the mean RTD at the flow rate of 15 l/h was equal to 176, 5 seconds and           
the value of F(t) = 0,97 was reached after 76 second . The mean RTD of the rest of the 
investigated flow rates were growing nearly linear: at 10 l/h it had the value of 263 second, at 6 l/h flow rate 485,7 seconds and at the minimal speed 612,8 seconds. To reach the point of F(t) = 0,97 at the speed of 10 l/h nearly 13 minutes were required, at the 6 l/h almost            
26 minutes. The minimal flow rate achieved the value of F(t) = 0,92 after 38 minutes and then 
the experiment was disrupted by too intensive fluid’s level fluctuations. 
8.1.5. RTD in the electrolysis cell 
The RTD of the electrolysis cell was difficult to compare with theoretical existing reactor models because of its specific setup. Two inner flows through the micro tubes and the glassy carbon filling made the classification of the electrolysis cell as a one of the known RTD models impossible. The experiment gave important information about the cathode flow:          it allowed to identify the minimal flow rate through the cathode tube system, which had to be equal or greater than 10 l/h. At the flow rate of 9,5 l/h the outlet tube from cathode stayed 
filled with water and the whole flow passes through anode tubes. The experimental results are presented at Figure 8.6. Chapter 8 – Experimental results – reactors’ characterisation                                         54

Figure 8.6: F(t) curves obtained from step tracer experiments done in electrolysis cell at different flow 
rates 
The F(t) curve at the minimal flow rate was growing gently, showing similarities to the CSTR 
curve. The mean RTD was equal to 90,6 seconds and the point of F(t) = 0,9 was reached 
after 104 seconds. The flow rate of 15 l/h also did not result in a rapid rise of the curve. Its 
mean RTD was the same as 67,3 seconds and F(t) = 0,9 was achieved after 72 seconds. 
Prompt increases of the F(t) values could only be noticed at 20 l/h and 24 l/h. The mean RTD 
at the greatest flow rate was equal to 31,2 seconds, the value of F(t)=0,9 was reached after 
48 seconds. At the flow rate of 20 l/h the rapid growth ended after F(t) = 0,8 after 56 second. 
The mean RTD at that flow was only a bit lower and equal to 48,1 seconds. 
8.1.6. Hydraulic residence time vs. mean residence time 
Experimentally established mean residence time values in different reactor types should be close to the one calculated from Eq. 6.1. Table 12 shows that data achieved in RTD 
investigation had higher or smaller variations from the hydraulic residence time values.         In that comparison electrolysis cell was not considered.

The greatest differences were noticed in the coil reactor tests, the effective values 
determined about 50 – 60 % of the hydraulic residence time values. That fact could be explained with existence of dead zones (see Chapter 6.1). The other deviation was observed 
in the PFRs, at the lowest and highest flow rates. In this case we can speak about two different flows. As the fluid flow was easier to observe when the colour solution was replaced with water, one of the test was done in that way. Figure 8.7 clearly shows two various fluid 
flows: the one is located just next to the UV lamp area (deeper rose colour) and the other one (light rose colour) is running with higher speed in some distance from the lamp. 
 
Figure 8.7: Step tracer test in large PFR: two flows in fluid visible (deep and light rose) 
The fact, that the mean residence time values were lower than the hydraulic residence time ones, could also be explained with persistence of dead zones in the reactor, for example under the UV lamp in PFRs. Higher than theoretically values could be considered as              a consequence of pressure lost, especially at low flow rates.

As the effective mean residence time was not always identical as the hydraulic one, there 
was also a difference between the mean residence time estimating. This inequality shows 
Figure 8.8, where two F(t) curves of the small PFR at a flow rate of 20 l/h are presented, as 
well as F(t) of the ideal PFR. MTD was established according to Eq. 6.9 twice: once using 
the hydraulic residence time and the second time using the mean residence time.

Figure 8.9: Comparison of F(t) curves in different reactors at the flow rate of 3 l/h 
Figure 8.9 displays different reactors at the flow rate of 3 l/h over time ( ș). The coil reactor 
had the shortest RTD and a very steep run of the F(t) curve, which means, that its flow was 
the closest to the ideal one. The F(t) curve of the small PFR was very similar to that of the 
coil reactor, only its RTD was longer. The value of F(t) = 0,7 was first reached by the large 
PFR, however its later RTD curve run did not increase as fast as the small PFR. The RTD curve of the CSTR was the most gently growing one and achieved only F(t) = 0,47 at ș = 1. Chapter 8 – Experimental results – reactors’ characterisation                                         58

Figure 8.10: Comparison of F(t) curves in different reactors at the flow rate of 6 [l/h] 
Figure 8.10 confirms the tendency of Figure 8.9: the F(t) curve of the coil reactor grew rapidly 
and reached its maximum after 3, 2 ș, while the large pipe reactor needed almost 5 ș.         
The RTD curve of the small PFR still remained an ideal one, but the curve of the larger one 
was more like the RTD curve of the CSTR. All of the reactor types had the ș value of 1 in the 
range of F(t) = 0,65, only the CSTR curve came to that point at F(t) = 0,62. 
At the comparison of flow rates of 10 l/h, presented at Figure 8.11, the coil reactor flow was 
again a very near example of the ideal one. The RTD curve of the small PFR was very similar to that of the coil reactor. It had the same value for ș = 1, which was F(t) = 0,67, only 
the maximum was reached much later: after ș = 4,7. The large PFR curve was in that case 
very irregular. It has the same F(t) value equal to 0,64 for ș = 1 as the CSTR, however its run 
was much steeper. Chapter 8 – Experimental results – reactors’ characterisation                                         59

Figure 8.11: Comparison of F(t) curves in different reactors at the flow rate of 10 [l/h] 
Figure 8.11 shows that with higher flow rate the RTD curves of the reactors became much 
steeper. It was again the coil reactor, which reached F(t) = 0,97 after ș = 1,4 as the first one. 
The large PFR needed 2,5 ș to achieve that point, the small one 3,3 ș and the CSTR 3,4 ș. 
However the run of the small PFR’s F(t) curve was growing rapidly at the beginning and 
matched the large reactor curve until the ș = 0,8, afterwards it required a long time to reach 
the maximum. The coil and the small PFR had the same F(t) value for ș =1 which was equal 
to 0,7. The large PFR and the CSTR had at that point the value F(t) = 0,63. 
At Figure 8.12 F(t) curves of various reactors at 15 l/h are presented. The small PFR and    
the coil reactor reached the mean time ș = 1 at F(t) value equal to 0,7. The large PFR and 
the CSTR at that time had a value of 0,62. The coil reactor F(t) curve was again the steepest 
one. Although the small PFR curve run was at the beginning very steep, after ș = 1 it 
increased at a much slower rate.  Chapter 8 – Experimental results – reactors’ characterisation                                         60

8.2. Radiant power in various reactors 
Photon irradiance with UV radiation in various reactors was determined using chemical 
actinometer, which in this case was potassium iodide/iodate solution. According to Rahn [30] 
it has a very good ability to measure photon flow from a low-pressure mercury lamp with        a wave length of 254 nm. Using Eq. 3.11 the radiant power recovery could have been 
calculated. 
The actinometer experiments were run in all reactor types with various flow rates as               
a continuous process (no circulation of fluid). The batch reactor was tested in discontinuous 
conditions with mixing at 250 rpm. 
8.2.1. Experimental run 
The experimental setup consisted of a 3 liter tank T1 with a potassium iodide/iodate solution, 
which was pumped into the reactor and gathered in the second tank T2. Both of the tanks were covered with aluminum foil to prevent the solution from visible light influence. The reactors with an immersed UV lamp were also wrapped with foil to protect the user from harmful radiation. Samples were taken just behind reactor’s outlet, using a special cock, at time intervals estimated from RTD measurements. In the reactors with larger volume, like the large PFR, it was necessary to mix gathered solution from T2 with that what remained in T1 after every flow rate change. The zero sample was collected before every run, which enabled to estimated the real value of photon irradiance for each experiment. 
Quantum yield in PFRs was examined at flow rates of 3; 6; 10; 15 l/h. In the coil reactor there 
were also extra tests at the minimal speeds of 0,3; 0,75; 1; 1,5 l/h. At every flow at least three 
samples were taken. In the batch reactor eight samples were taken in a time interval of          3 minutes. 
To warm up the UV lamp, it was switched on a few minutes before starting the experiments. 
In an investigation with the batch reactor, potassium iodide/iodate solution was inserted through one of the upper inlets and the first sample was taken directly after finish of this action. 
During the experiment the UV-lamp was placed in cooling cover connected to the heat 
exchanger with provided stable temperature of 25 
oC.  
The outlet solution was prepared according to Rahn [30]. Potassium iodide, potassium iodate 
and Borax (Na 2B4O7) where mixed together with 3 liter of deionized water with concentration 
cKI = 0,6 M, c KIO3 = 0,1 M and c Borax = 0,01 M. The pH-value of the outlet solution varied 
between 9,22...9,3 and at the end of the measurements increased a little bit – about 0,05.  Chapter 8 – Experimental results – reactors’ characterisation                                         62

8.2.2. Experimental results 
The effective UV-lamp radiant power was calculated basing on the triiodide concentration 
measurements. Before starting the photons flow calculations, it had to be specified whether all the radiation at the wavelength of 254 nm was absorbed in the reactors. The path length of reacting zone could be estimated with the Lambert-Beer law using Eq. 3.6. The molar 
absorptivity of potassium iodide at concentration of 0,6 M was equal to 27400 M
-1cm-1 and 
assuming radiation capability of I/I 0 = 90% we get the value of path length d = 0,6 *10-4 cm. 
The result gave the information, that 90 % of the whole radiation was absorbed just at the boundary layer of actinometer solution and reactor’s quartz glass wall. 
The absorbance of the samples was checked at the wave length of 352 nm and using        
Eq. 6.17 amount of triiodide, which was built through photochemical reaction, could have 
been calculated. Table 13 shows an example of actinometer data evaluation for coil reactor 
at flow rate of 10 l/h.

8.2.3. Effective radiant power in reactors 
The UV-lamp was described in details in Chapter 7.4.1. The efficient radiator power of          
a 20 cm long arc is equal to 10 W. In fact, the real value in the reactors was much lower as 
the cooling cover construction did not allow immersing the whole lamp in the reactors.  
In case of the coil reactor only 13,5 cm of the arc length was surrounded with the coil. What 
is more, in the middle of the lamp cooling coal, a grinding was situated, causing further loss of UV radiation. Another source of radiation loss were space gaps between reactor’s coils as well as the coils’ glass walls. These reasons gave 3,5 mm of losses between two coils and the final value was equal to 2,9 W. The whole calculation of real UV-lamp radiation could be found in Table 14.

Only 36 % of the arc length of the UV lamp could have been immersed in the large PFR 
which resulted in radiant power of 3,6 W. In the small PFR that value was equal to 3,75 W.   In the batch reactor filled with 0,82 liter of actinometer solution 7 cm of the arc was effectively used. After every sampling the solution volume in the reactor was slightly changing and at the end of the experiment the liquid surface was 1,3 cm below its starting level. Because of the reactor’s construction, the most remarkable drop took place at the first sampling (about 0,5 cm), after that the differences were minimal and their influence on reliability could been neglected. 
8.2.4. Radiant power in the coil reactor and PFRs 
The coil reactor and PFRs would be compared together as all of them had continuous flow as opposed to discontinuous batch reactor. Figure 8.13 presents the effective power 
radiation achieved during the experiments at various rate flows.

(35 W),O = 254 nm.  
Clearly, the highest values were reached in the coil reactor. A relative small radiant power 
value at minimal speeds was increasing together with the growing flow rate up to 6 l/h, when it became constant at P = 1,4 W. 
In case of PFRs a little growth of power during flow rate escalation can be noticed. The 
minimal value of small reactor was equal to 0,23 W and the maximal to 0,42 W. The power radiation at the flow rate of 3 l/h in the large reactor was the same as 0,16 W and at the highest speed 0,22 W. 
According to the theoretical power, which should be achieved in reactors the recovery of 
radiant power was analysed and its results can be seen at the Figure 8.14. Chapter 8 – Experimental results – reactors’ characterisation                                         65

With the recovery reaching nearly 50 %, it is obvious, that the coil reactor is the most efficient 
one. The small PFR exceeds the value of P eff/Ptheor = 11 % at the highest flow rates, while the 
large PFR’s efficiency is situated at 6 %.  Chapter 8 – Experimental results – reactors’ characterisation                                         66

8.2.5. Radiant power in batch reactor  
As the actinometer measurement in the batch reactor was a discontinuous process, 
concentration of triidodide increased as the time elapsed. Figure 8.15 shows how the yellow 
colour would be intensified in every next taken sample. 
 
Figure 8.15: Samples taken from actinometer measurement in the batch reactor: AKT-S test 
The actinometer experiment in the batch reactor was carried out twice. At the first time           a small stirrer was used with 250 rpm. Maximal photon flow at those conditions reached the value of 1*10
-6 einstein/s. In comparison with tests done by Gangl [26] in the similar 
laboratory conditions, the results were not satisfying. In the second run a larger stirrer was used at the 500 rpm. As a result, the photon flow was equal to 2,2*10
-6. Up to 30 minutes the 
concentration of triiodide was growing linearly, after that time its increase slowed down.       As after some time the amount of triiodide achieved the point of saturation, in the reactor characterisation only the first seven values would be taken into consideration. At Figure 8.16 
triiodide concentration against time is presented during the run of both experiments. Chapter 8 – Experimental results – reactors’ characterisation                                         67

As it comes to the radiant power and its recovery in the batch reactor it has to be mentioned, 
that the sample drawing could have influenced solution’s level in the reactor and reduced the arc length immersed in it, however this fact had not such a big impact on the radiant power determination. The radiant power, calculated from first seven samples, brought the mean value of 1,08 W. There was a problem with defining the recovery of the photon flow.          The estimated value was situated in the range of 38 – 47 %.  Chapter 8 – Experimental results – reactors’ characterisation                                         68

8.3. Cathodic hydrogen peroxide generation 
As it was mentioned in Chapter 1 H 2O2/UV combination is one of the better known AOPs 
method. Further laboratory test with combined EDTA anodic oxidation and photochemical degradation had also the purpose to generate hydrogen peroxide on the cathode, which should improve synthetic water decomposition. To characterise possibility of cathodic generation of hydrogen peroxide some laboratory tests were done applying various output currents, solution flow rates and pH-values. The used electrolyte solution was 0,5 M Na
2SO 4. 
8.3.1. Electrolysis cell resistance and cathodic potential 
According to Qiang, Chang and Huang [31], the best cathodic potential for hydrogen 
peroxide production is located at U c = -0,5 V. To find out an optimal output current value, 
scanning tests were done to obtai n desirable cathodic potential value. Anodic potential 
calibration tests on iridium oxide anode done by Zelenka [22] allowed to calculate the 
electrolysis cell resistance and the cathodic potential.

8.3.2. Current density and solution rate flow variation 
To describe the possible hydrogen peroxide production on the cathode three test series were 
done with various solution rate flows and different output current. All the taken samples were analysed with potassium iodide titration, described in Chapter 7.1.2. 
During the first test run: OM_10, the electrolyte was circulating at a flow rate of 10 l/h and      
a start pH = 3 ± 0,2. Hydrogen peroxide production was checked at three current densities:    
1,1 A/m
2; 2,2 A/m2 – both within 45 minutes and 4,4 A/m2 within 165 minutes. Blank samples 
were taken from the solution tank before starting the experiment and their analysis showed no presence of hydrogen peroxide. Figure 8.19 presents the achieved values. After every 
test the electrolyte was pumped out of the laboratory unit, which was then filled again with    
a new solution.

with glassy carbon filling (A specific  = 0,147m2). Electrolyte solution: V total = 1,2 l, c Na2SO4  = 0,05 M. 
The result of the experiment revealed very little cathode ability to product hydrogen peroxide 
at these laboratory conditions. In the first two tests hydrogen peroxide concentration was much below expected value and the experiments were interrupted. Only OM_10c test with     a current density of 4,4 A/m
2 was carried out longer. In 135 minutes hydrogen peroxide 
concentration reached maximum c H2O2 = 13,08 mg/l and after that fell down again. Obtained 
values represent less than 10 % recovery in comparison with theoretical ones, calculated from Eq. 2.19. 
OM_24 test serie was done without electrolyte exchange between the switching of the 
current density. The solution circulated at a maximal possible flow rate of 24 l/h and pH = 2. Chapter 8 – Experimental results – reactors’ characterisation                                         71

Blank sample was taken from the tank before laboratory test begun. OM_24c test at the

(Aspecific  = 0,147m2). Electrolyte solution: V total = 1,15 l, c Na2SO4  = 0,05 M. 
The maximum hydrogen peroxide concentration value was achieved in 315 minutes at the 
current density of 4,4 A/m2 and after that dropped slightly. However, in this test run only 
absolute values change had to be taken into account. As it can be easily noticed, the highest concentration increase ǻc
H2O2 = 16,8 mg/l had occurred during current density of 2,2 A/m2.   
At 1,1 A/m2 hydrogen peroxide amount was oscillating between 5 and 10 mg/l without any 
visible growing tendency and at 4,4 A/m2 and 8,8 A/m2 concentration growth was about        
5 mg/l. After a 12-hour break the hydrogen peroxide level dropped down nearly to its start value of c
H2O2 = 9 mg/l. That fact was a clue that although hydrogen peroxide was degraded, 
some part of it always remained in the electrolysis cell. 
The next run consisted of three tests done at current density of 2 A/m2: OMd24, OMh24 and 
OMi24; and one done at 1,76 A/m2: OMe24. Output current was chosen according to 
cathode potential calculations in Chapter 8.3.1. The electrolyte was changed after every test, 
but this time blank samples were taken after few minutes of current-less solution circulation 
in the laboratory unit. The electrolyte was distributed with a rate flow of 24 l/h and pH = 2.  Chapter 8 – Experimental results – reactors’ characterisation                                         72

Electrolyte solution: V total = 1 l, c Na2SO4  = 0,05 M. 
As Figure 8.21 presents, hydrogen peroxide concentration in the blank samples was 
surprisingly high, located between 5 and 15 mg/l and in the case of OMh24 reaching even the value of 40 mg/l. The maximal hydrogen peroxide amount during the experimental run was achieved in the OMe24 test with the value of c
H2O2 = 22 mg/l. However, after reaching 
top value the hydrogen peroxide content in the electrolyte began to decrease. In the OMd24 and OMi24 test runs the hydrogen peroxide amount was growing continuously to achieve      a concentration level between 15 and 20 mg/l. The OMh24 experimental curve, after abrupt 
fall from the starting value, at 105 minute began to increase and in 210 minutes reached     
the point of c
H2O2 = 20 mg/l. 
According to performed tests, cathodic hydrogen peroxide generation in EC Electro MP-Cell 
would have to be further optimised to result in more predictable values. What could be determined is, that using the 0,5 M Na
2SO 4 electrolyte at a flow rate of 24 l/h and current 
density between 1,8 – 2,2 A/m2 a hydrogen peroxide concentration of c H2O2 = 20 ± 5 mg/l in 
EC Electro MP-Cell could be achieved. Chapter 9 –  E x p e r i m e n t a l  r e s u l t s  –  E D T A  d e g r a d a t i o n                                          7 3

9. Experimental results – EDTA degradation 
9.1. Anodic oxidation 
The laboratory investigation of the anodic oxidation of EDTA was carried out according to the 
optimised experiments done by Zelenka [22]. Taking laboratory conditions from the best 
results achieved by Zelenka, in tests with EC Electro MP-Cell  the current density of           
20,2 A/m2 was selected and an electrolyte 0,05 M Na 2SO 4 and 1,34 mM EDTA solution.             
To confirm reproducibility of the investigation, two tests were done in the same laboratory 
conditions. The EDTA concentration in the samples was measured by HPLC analysis, described in Chapter 7.2. 
The laboratory unit consisted of a mixing tank from which the solution was pumped through 
the thermostat into the electrolysis cell and after that back again into the tank. The pH-control was installed in the mixing tank. The laboratory unit scheme is presented at Figure 9.1.

V = 15 l/h, T = 25 oC.  
The degradation curves of AOP-6 and AOP-9 show some differences in their run. By the first 
experiment, after 300 minutes EDTA was decomposed in 77 % and in the second one after 360 minutes only in 81%. The reaction rate constants calculated according to 1
st order 
reaction run were equal to 0,0009 –min in the first experiment and 0,0006 –min in the second 
one. According to Eq. 2.22 EDTA-degradation grade achieved after 300 constituted only 53% 
of the expected value in AOP-6 experiment and 36% in case of AOP-9. 
The fact of the various EDTA degradation run could be explained with unequal pH-value run 
in both experiments, what can be observed at Figure 9.3.  Chapter 9 –  E x p e r i m e n t a l  r e s u l t s  –  E D T A  d e g r a d a t i o n                                          7 5

Although the starting pH-value was nearly the same: pH EAOP6  = 4,66 and pH EAOP9  = 4,78, in

EAOP9  = 5,05. 
According to Chapter 1.1 and Figure 5.1 the EDTA has various dissociation grades with 
various reaction constant rates, which strongly depends on the pH-value. Even small differences of 0,1 [-] could influence the whole degradation process.

9.2. Photochemical degradation of Fe(II)-EDTA 
Laboratory tests with photochemical degradation of Fe(III)-EDTA complex were investigated 
in the coil reactor, the small PFR and the batch reactor. Additionally the coil reactor was tested in a closed system, where defined volume of solution was circulating in the laboratory unit during 30 minutes. 
Based on investigations carried out by Gangl [26], the ratio between Fe(II) and EDTA in      
the solution was the same as 2:1, because of the best EDTA degradation rate constant achieved at those proportions. The outlet solution used in all tests consisted of                 1,34 mM EDTA and 0,67 mM Fe
2SO 4*7H 2O mixture. 
Fe(III)-EDTA complex has a quite high value of extinction coefficient, which at a wavelength 
of O = 254 nm and pH = 3,5 is equal to 8350 ± 150 M-1cm-1. Using Eq. 3.5 it could be 
calculated, that 90 % of the whole radiation will be absorbed within the path length of d = 1,7 
mm.  
As the degradation process requires a pH value between 3…5 all of the experiments had      
a starting pH-value of 3 ± 0.1. In the case of the PFRs the pH limit at the reactor outlet was 
not exceeded. The batch reactor represented the only problem, as the experimental setup did not allow to retain the pH-value at the same level and after 30 minutes it exceeded        
pH = 5. This fact did not considerably influence the whole test, as the main degradation process was finished in 20 minutes. 
During the experiments the temperature was equal to 25 ± 1 
oC and the Fe(II)-EDTA solution 
was aerated with the air flow rate of 20 l/h (STP). The volume of the solution used in tests with the batch reactor and the coil reactor as a closed system was the same as 0,82 l. All the samples were analysed with a HPLC instrument, following instructions described in     
Chapter 7.2.
 
9.2.1. Photochemical Fe(II)-EDTA degradation in coil reactor 
Fe(II)-EDTA degradation in the coil reactor was examined in two cases: as a plug flow and 
also as a closed circulation process. In the first case, the experimental setup consisted of      a container C1 with 1 litre output solution, the coil reactor with the immeresed UV lamp,     the cock and the collecting basin. Container C1 and the reactor with fixed UV lamp were wrapped in aluminium foil to prevent from UV radiation and day light influence. The solution passed through reactor only once and samples were taken just behind reactor outlet using the cock closure and kept in darkness until analysis. 
Various flow rates were tested starting at a very low speed rate of 0,3 l/h through 0,75; 1,0; 
1,5; 3,0; 6,0 up to 10 l/h. Time interval of sample drawing was calculated from mean residence time. To prove reproducibility of the experiment two samples were taken from each 
flow rate. To better compare the effectiveness of different flow rates, Figure 9.4 presents the 
test results as constant rates.

pHstart = 3 ± 0.1, T = 25oC, AirVx
= 20 l/h (STP) 
Although at the flow rate of 0,3 l/h Fe(II)-EDTA was degraded in 99% and at 10 l/h in only 
35% it did not really describe the real radiation effect. The residence time of the solution in the reactor had to be taken into consider. As Figure 9.4 shows: with a growing flow rate in 
reactor the constant rate value was also increasing. The maximum was achieved at            
x
V = 10 l/h and its value was k = 0,011 M/min. At the minimal speed the constant rate was 
the same as k = 0,001 M/min. Those results could be easily explained with the character of 
the flow in the reactor. With growing speed of the fluid, the reactor turbulence was higher. Considerable turbulence of the fluid particles enables to radiate more of them, what could not be achieved at a laminar flow. 
According to Chapter 8.2, where the photon flow for every flow rate was determined and 
using Eq. 3.9 the quantum yield of Fe(III)-EDTA could be calculated. The value of the 
quantum yield varied depending on the flow rate. Up till 1,5 l/h it was smaller than )
O < 0,2. 
At the maximal flow rate it was equal to )O = 0,43. Explanation of that fact is the same as the 
one given to the rate constant differences at various flows. Exact values of the experiments 
could be found in the annex. 
The second experiment with the coil reactor was run as a closed system, where Fe(III)-EDTA 
solution of volume V = 0,82 l was circulated in the laboratory unit until it was completely 
degraded.  Experimental setup consisted of the mixing tank, in that case the CSTR, from 
which the solution was pumped into the coil reactor with an immersed lamp and led back into the tank. Samples were drawn just behind the reactor with following time intervals: 0,5; 1; 2; Chapter 9 –  E x p e r i m e n t a l  r e s u l t s  –  E D T A  d e g r a d a t i o n                                          7 8

4; 6; 8; 10; 15; 20; 30 minutes. To achieve maximal turbulence, the highest possible flow rate 
was chosen, which meant 20 l/h. The pH-value at the beginning of the experiment was equal 
to 3,05 and at the end had came over to pH = 5 . Figure 9.5 represents the degradation run of 
Fe(III)-EDTA .

The most apparent remark from Figure 9.5 is the abrupt and steep fall of the degradation 
curve in the first 30 seconds to the value c EDTA/cEDTA0 = 0,8. This fact could be explained with 
sample taking. The first one was taken just as the solution passed through the coil reactor for the first time. The next ones were drawn after the irradiated fluid was mixed in the tank with not yet irradiated solution, which led to a later non-linear degradation of the solution. After    15 minutes less than 90 % of Fe(II)-EDTA was left, after 30 minutes it was completely removed. 
9.2.2. Photochemical Fe(II)-EDTA degradation in the small PFR 
Experimental setup for degradation of the Fe(II)-EDTA complex in the small PFR was almost the same as the one used in the coil reactor: the prepared outlet solution was kept in the mixing tank T1 from which it was led into the reactor with an immersed lamp at various flow rates and gathered in the storage tank T2. The difference concerned the way of aeration:     Chapter 9 –  E x p e r i m e n t a l  r e s u l t s  –  E D T A  d e g r a d a t i o n                                          7 9

in the experiments FF-G and FF-H air bubbles were let direct into the reactor with a flow of      
10 l/h (STP) and FF-I was used as a control run, where the aeration with the same flow took place in batch reactor. The point was to investigate if the air bubbles did not absorb too much of the UV-radiation as they covered about 30 % of the reactor surface. 
 
Figure 9.6: Air bubbles in small pipe reactor 
Following flow rates were tested in the small PFR: 0,3; 0,75; 1,0; 1,5; 3,0; 6,0; 10,0; 15,0 l/h. 
The outlet pH-value was equal to pH = 3±0.1 and in series FF-G and FF-H at the end exceeded the value of pH = 5 at the minimal speeds. The temperature was constant and equal to 25 
oC. Figure 9.7 displays experimental results presented as constant rates.

cFe2SO4*7H2O  = 0,67 mM, pH start =  3 ± 0,1, T = 25oC, AirVx
= 20 l/h (STP) 
Although test series FF-G and FF-H were run in the same laboratory conditions, slight 
differences between achieved constant rate values could be noticed, especially at higher solution flow rates. With greater turbulence of the fluid in the reactor, particle and air bubbles distribution in the solution were different in every test, which could cause various radiation absorbance. The maximum value of the constant rate was reached in FF-G test at the flow rate of 10 l/h and overstepped a bit 0,012 M/min. At the highest speed it was slightly smaller, equal to k = 0,011 M/min. The constant rate in FF-H run was increasing with the growing flow 
rate of the solution in the reactor and at 15 l/ h had the value of 0,012 M/min. On the contrary 
to what was expected, the control run FF-I brought worse results than FF-G and FF-H.      The constant rate in that case reached the peak in k = 0,01 M/min. Apparently, the aeration directly in the reactor improves the degradation of the Fe(II)-EDTA complex. 
As it comes to the quantum yield in the small PTR, the situation was slightly complicated. 
Using the data obtained through the chemical actinometer measurements done in Chapter 
8.2.4, the calculation of the quantum yield in the small PFR gave the value greater than 1, 
what is technically impossible. The fact was, that the actinometer experiments where done without aeration and the extinction coefficient of iodide was much greater than that of     Fe(II)-EDTA, which means, that the pathway of the irradiated solution was much smaller.   The conclusion is simple: at the actinometer experiments only boundary layer of                    d = 0,6 *10
-4 cm was irradiated, while in Fe(II)-EDTA it was equal to d = 0,17 cm.              
That means, that in the case of Fe (II)-EDTA degradation much more of the solution particles had to be irradiated. That was the reason to assume the same photon flow in the small PFR Chapter 9 –  E x p e r i m e n t a l  r e s u l t s  –  E D T A  d e g r a d a t i o n                                          8 1

as the one achieved in the batch reactor experiment. In that case it was equal to                 
)P = 2,29*10-6 einstein/s. The calculations done with that value, gave a quantum yield of the 
small PFR, which varied depending on ithe solution flow rate. Up till 1,5 l/h it was smaller or 
equal than 0,2. At higher flow rates it was situated over )O > 0,5 in series FF-G and FF-H 
and in case of F-I )O< 0,5.  
9.2.3. Photochemical Fe(II)-EDTA degradation in the batch reactor 
Tests in the batch reactor were run as a closed process, where defined volume of          
Fe(II)-EDTA solution was mixed and irradiated with UV-radiation until it would be completely degraded. The whole experimental setup consisted of the batch reactor with immersed lamp and a stirrer moving with 300 rpm, a pH electrode, an aeration frit and a sampling outlet attached to the reactor. 
The UV-lamp was turned on for few minutes to warm up before starting the experiment and 
after that 0,82 l of the solution was quickly added into the reactor and the first sample was taken. Next samples were drawn after 3; 6; 10; 15; 20; 30; 45 minutes and in the FF-D run 
also after 60 minutes. The pH-value was not regulated during the experiment. Its start value 
was pH = 3 ± 0.1 and after 30 minutes exceeded the limit of 5. The temperature was held constant at T = 25 
oC and the aeration flow rate was the same at 20 l/h (STP). 
Figure 9.8 describes the Fe(II)-EDTA decomposition in the batch reactor. FC run shows 
experiment’s results done by Gangl [26] in the same type of a reactor, but with the pH-value 
of pH = 3 kept all the time at that level. Chapter 9 –  E x p e r i m e n t a l  r e s u l t s  –  E D T A  d e g r a d a t i o n                                          8 2

The degradation curves do not differ from each other, only the FC run is slightly steeper and 
achieved 90 % of FE(III)-EDTA degradation after 15 minutes, while FF-C and FF-D series reached about 85 % at that time. Photochemical reactions are in principle 0. order reactions. First four points of the FF-C and FF-D series created almost a perfectly linear line, the next ones made it more similar to a 1
st order reaction run. This fact could be explained with        
the Fe(III)-ED3A formation as one of the decomposition products, which absorbed part of  the UV-radiation, and the photon amount available for Fe(III)-EDTA complex degradation would be smaller. Another possible explanation of that exponential trend of the curve was that 90 % of the irradiation was absorbed within 0,17 cm so the most remote particles, despite mixing, could never be reached. Because of the mentioned reasons only the first values of FF-C and FF-D series were taken into account to define the reaction rate constant. 
Considering the first four points the reaction rate constant would be equal to k = 0,062 M/min 
and taking first five points the value would be the same as k = 0,07 M/min. In the experiment 
done by Gangl the valuation brought the outcome of k = 0,061 M/min. 
As it comes to the quantum yield in the batch reactor, its value was decreasing at the time. 
The maximum, achieved after 3 minutes, was equal to 
)O=ҏ 0,63 and after 15 minutes was 
reduced to )O= 0,45 and after 45 minutes to )Ọ= 0,17. That situation could be again 
explained with ED3A formation. Gangl [26] calculated the quantum yield of Fe(III)-EDTA as 
equal to 0,37. Chapter 9 –  E x p e r i m e n t a l  r e s u l t s  –  E D T A  d e g r a d a t i o n                                          8 3

In Anox/H 2O2Cath/UV investigations the EDTA was degraded through •OH radicals, which 
came from UV irritated hydrogen peroxide that had been produced on the cathode (see Chatpter 5.4), and also through anodic oxidiation. Two types of the experiment were carried 
out with different reactors: the CSTR and the large PFR. To prove the reproducibility of the 
study each test was done twice. 
A 0,5 M Na
2SO 4 and 1,34 mM EDTA solution with a circulation flow rate of 15 l/h was used 
as the electrolyte. Output current of 0,26 A corresponded to a current density of 27,6 A/m2 on 
the anode and 1,7 A/m2 on the cathode. The solution was aerated with an air flow rate of     
20 l/h (STP) and the start pH = 3 ± 0,1. 
9.3.1. Anox/H 2O2Cath/UV process in the CSTR 
In the laboratory tests AOP_4_EzR4 and AOP_5_EzR4 the UV lamp was immersed in        
the CSTR, from which the solution was pumped into the electrolysis cell and after that again back to the reactor. The CSTR was wrapped in aluminum foil to prevent the surroundings from the UV radiation. A gas frit, a pH electrode and a temperature measurement were fixed in the CSTR.

Although at the beginning the AOP_5_EzR4 decomposition curve had nearly the same run 
as the AOP_4_EzR4 one, the complete decomposition of EDTA ended after 300 minutes, while in the second case only 150 minutes were required. In the experiment done by Zelenka after 6 hours c
EDTA/cEDTA0 = 0,044. In the investigation done by Gangl [26] 180 minutes were 
necessary for 95 % decomposition of the EDTA. The reaction rate constants calculated according to 1
st order reaction run are equal to 0,018 –min in the first experiment and       
0,014 –min in the second one. 
Differences in the EDTA degradation curves at both experiments could have been caused by 
various particles distribution in the reactor what meant also unequal irradiation of the particles during both tests. What is more, the pH-value run at both experiments was not identical, which is shown in Figure 9.12.

At Figure 9.12 the pH-value run in all three tests is presented. In the AOP_4_EzR4 
experiment, after the EDTA was completely degraded, the pH-value had risen to pH = 5,7.    In the AOP_5_EzR4 test the pH-value was increasing continuously till pH = 3,76. In case of the experiment done by Zelenka, the start pH was greater, pH = 5, and grew rapidly to pH = 6,2 further run was slightly rising till pH = 7,6.
 
9.3.2. Anox/H 2O2Cath/UV process in the large PFR 
The experimental setup in tests AOP_7 and AOP_8 consisted of a mixing tank from which 
the solution was pumped into the large PFR with an immersed UV lamp and after that led into the electrolysis cell, from which it returned in the tank. A gas frit was attached in the reactor, a pH and temperature measuring instrument in the tank. The experimental setup scheme is presented at Figure 9.13.

The EDTA degradation curve in the first experiment had a slightly steeper run than in         
the second one. In AOP_7_EzR2 test the synthetic water was decomposed in 84 %, in the AOP_8_EzR2 only in 78%. The reaction rate constants calculated according to 1
st order 
reaction run were equal to 0,006 –min in the first experiment and 0,004 –min in the second 
one.  
The possible reason of the differences in the EDTA degradation curve runs were explained in 
Chapter 9.3.1. The pH-value run at both experiments was also not identical, which presents 
Figure 9.15. Chapter 9 –  E x p e r i m e n t a l  r e s u l t s  –  E D T A  d e g r a d a t i o n                                          8 8

After 50 minutes the pH-curve of AOP_7_EzR2 test started increasing much faster than that 
of the AOP_8_EzR2 and at the end reached pH = 3,36. In the second case this value was equal to 3,24. That would be another explanation of various EDTA degradation rates in both experiments: as it was mentioned before (Chapter 1.1 and 9.1), EDTA has 4 dissociation 
grades, which influence the reaction constant rates.  
9.4. Specific energy demand 
To enable the comparison of various AOP techniques and different reactors the specific energy demand was calculated according to Chapter 2.4 and 3.6. In Table 16 the specific 
energy demands of all investigated EDTA-degradation methods are shown together. Chapter 9 –  E x p e r i m e n t a l  r e s u l t s  –  E D T A  d e g r a d a t i o n                                          8 9

The specific energy demand of the anodic oxidation and Anox/H 2O2Cath/UV method was 
calculated  for the time span equal to 300 minutes. When it comes to the Fe(II)-EDTA 
photolysis investigation for the coil reactor experiment the best achieved result was taken into account, what related to the flow rate of 10 l/h. The same flow value was considered in case of the small PFR. The experiment with the coil reactor with circulation flow was treated the same way as a CSTR test with the volume of 0,82 l. The specific energy demand of the CSTR experiment was calculated for 30 minutes and 98 % Fe(II)-EDTA decomposition. 
The Fe(II)-EDTA photolysis emerged as the most effective method with regards to              
the specific energy demand, especially while using the small PFR and the coil reactor.            
The CSTR process involved a double value of specific energy demand. Even more was necessary in case of the circulation flow in the coil reactor. The specific energy demand value of the direct anodic oxidation remained at a relatively low level, however the low reaction constant rate of EDTA-degradation has to be considered. The Anox/H
2O2Cath/UV 
methods, despite their high rate constants, require a lot of energy effort, which was ten times higher in comparison to other processes. At Figure 9.16 those differences are even more 
visible.  Chapter 9 –  E x p e r i m e n t a l  r e s u l t s  –  E D T A  d e g r a d a t i o n                                          9 0

10. Summary 
The goals of this master thesis were to characterise the bench scale unit built up at VTU 
Technology laboratory including the comparison of the four different reactor types, as well as various AOPs methods application to find the most efficient instrument for EDTA degradation. In the following chapters, the results of each field of investigation are summarized. 
10.1. Bench scale unit characterisation 
The characterisation of the bench scale unit consisted of three parts: RTD and effective radiant power description in various reactors and the ability of the hydrogen peroxide generation on the granulate glassy carbon cathode. 
10.1.1. Residence time distribution 
The RTD investigation in the reactors was done with the application of the step input method and as a mark tracer fluid a coloured solution was used. The RTD was characterised as        a change of its concentration in the solution. The content of the coloured medium in the flowing solution was determined with the absorbance value, measured in                        a spectrophotometer. 
According to the results achieved from the investigation, the coil reactor and the CSTR have 
the closest run to the ideal ones. Although the values of RTD and HRT in both reactors have shown considerable differences at times, their F(t) function could be described without doubt 
as a typical plug flow and CSTR residence time distribution curve. The RTD in case of both PFRs strongly depended on the flow rate, especially in the large reactor. The flow rate of       3 l/h was obviously too low for that laboratory unit as many disruptions were noticed and the F(t) function was more alike the CSTR one. The same problem of too low flow rate occurred 
in the tests with the CSTR. That is why further application of those reactors at such a low 
flow rate would not be recommended.  
Another interesting observation was the existence of two fluid flows in PFRs: the one situated 
close to the UV lamp cooling coat surface and s lower that the second one, set at a distance 
from the cooling coat (see Figure 8.7). 
The electrolysis cell could not have been compar ed to any of the well-known theoretical 
reactor models because of its specific construction. The space between the electrode plates was filled with granulate glassy carbon, which restricted the applied flow rate in the              EC Electro MP Cell  to the minimal value of 10 l/h. Otherwise, the fluid would flow only 
through the anode’s tube system. 
The entire data concerning the RTD investigation in various reactors with the comparison to 
their HRT could be found in Table 12.

10.1.2. Radiant power 
Photon irradiance measurements in various reactors were done with the use of a chemical 
actinometer, which in this case was a potassium iodide/iodate solution. The photon 
irradiance was determined from the concentration of created triiodide. The actinometer experiments were run in all reactor types with various flow rates as a continuous process. The batch reactor was tested in discontinuous conditions with mixing at 250 rpm. 
The effective radiant power in the reactors was limited because of the UV lamp cooling coat 
set-up. From the theoretical value of 10 W guaranteed by the producer, only 2,9 W was recovered in the coil reactor, 3,6 W in the large PRF and 3,75 W in the small PFR. In case of the batch reactor that value was equal to 1,08 W.  
The best radiant power efficiency was presented by the coil reactor at flow rates exceeding       
5 l/h. The achieved value in those conditions was equal to 1,4 W, which corresponded to nearly 50% of the theoretical value. The radiant power below 5 l/h was relatively low, situated under 1 W, and increasing exponentially with growing speed. That allowed an assumption, that a higher fluid turbulence in the reactor causes better particles irradiation.  
In PFRs the radiant power efficiency was much lower. In the large PFR it was oscillating in 
the range of 0,2 W, independently of the applied flow rate, which corresponded to about 6 % of the theoretical value. In case of the small PFR radiant power reached a value of 0,4 W at its highest flow rates: 15 l/h and 20 l/h, which related to 11 % of the hypothetical values. 
The photon irradiance in the batch reactor was measured as a discontinuous process and 
the concentration of triiodide was increasing as the time elapsed. The experiment was carried out twice with various mixer speeds: 250 and 500 rpm. Higher turbulence of the fluid in the reactor caused better irradiation of the particles in the actinometer solution. The radiant power in the batch reactor at 500 rpm achieved 1,08 W and its efficiency varied between   38-47 % (for details see Chapter 1.1.1). 
10.1.3. Cathodic hydrogen peroxide generation 
The laboratory tests proved that the best output current to achieve the optimal cathode 
potential of Uc = -0,5 V would be situated in the range of 0,26...0,29 A, which related to 
1,8…2 A/m2. 
The investigation was primarily done at three different current densities: 1,1; 2,2; 4,4 A/m2 
and the flow rate of 10 l/h and the pH-value of 3. The experiments revealed very little cathode ability to hydrogen peroxide production. The obtained values represented less than 10 % recovery of the theoretical calculated values. Further experiments have shown the best efficiency at 2,2 A/m
2, the flow rate at 24 l/h and pH-value of 2 – the hydrogen peroxide 
increase within 135 minutes was equal to 16,8 mg/l.  
The last step of the investigation concerned tests run in the range of 2 ± 0,2 A/m2 at a flow 
rate of 24 l/h and a pH-value of 2. The concentration of generated H 2O2 at that conditions 
were equal to 20 ± 5 mg/l.  Chapter 10 –  S u m m a r y                                          9 3

10.2. AOPs in the EDTA degradation 
10.2.1. Direct anodic oxidation of EDTA 
Direct anodic oxidation of the EDTA did not yield the expected results. Basing on the 
investigation done by Zelenka [22] the chosen current density on the anode was equal to     
20 A/m2 and a pH-value to 5. Those laboratory conditions should assure the best current 
efficiency. In fact, only about 20 % of EDTA was decomposed after 300 minutes in both carried experiments. The current efficiency, ȕ, in the first experiment AOP_6 brought out the 
value of 53 % and in case of the second experiment only 37 %. Comparing the results to those achieved by Zelenka in similar laboratory conditions (see Chapter 1.1), a further 
investigation and optimisation of the anodic oxidation in the EC Electro MP-Cell  would be 
recommended. 
10.2.2. Photochemical degradation of Fe(II)-EDTA 
Bench scale experiments of the Fe(II)-EDTA photolysis investigated in the coil and the small PFR, and also in the batch reactor yielded very good results with a total Fe(II)-EDTA degradation within 20 minutes. The ratio between Fe(II) and EDTA in the solution was equal to 2:1 and the concentration of the outlet solution consisted of 1,34 mM EDTA and            0,67 mM Fe
2SO 4*7H 2O mixture. All of the experiments had a starting pH-value of 3 ± 0.1 and 
were aerated with an air flow rate of 20 l/h (STP). 
The best results were achieved in the batch reactor, where the rate constant of the         
Fe(II)-EDTA degradation was situated between 0,062 – 0,07 M/min. The 1,34 mM          Fe(II)-EDTA solution was decomposed in 85% within 15 minutes and in 99% within             30 minutes. The experiment with the coil reactor and a circulation flow of the Fe(II)-EDTA solution produced very good effect: at the flow rate of 20 l/h, 90% of Fe(II)-EDTA was degraded within 15 minutes.  
The coil reactor and the small PFR had the same rate constant of 0,012 M/min at the flow 
rate of 10 l/h, however after one flow through the coil reactor the Fe(II)-EDTA was degraded only in 35 %, in the PFR that figure was equal to  65 %. Although the rate constants of the 
Fe(II)-EDTA decomposition were much lower at smaller flow rates, the degradation grade after one flow through the plug reactor was greater. For example in the coil reactor at flow rate of 3 l/h, the constant rate was equal to 0,006 M/min, but the Fe(II)-EDTA would be degraded in 100%. In the small PFR at the flow rate of 1 l/h 90 % of the Fe(II)-EDTA was decomposed. The choice of the flow rate and the reactor should be considered according to its application in the planned  laboratory plant. 
The quantum yields, 
)O, of the Fe(III)-EDTA photolysis were situated in the range of 0,5.      
In the coil reactor that value was equal to 0,43 at the flow rate of 10 l/h and in case of the 
small PFR it exceeded the value of 0,55. The quantum yield measurements in the batch reactor were not as accurate, but the approximate value could be found between 0,45...0,63. Chapter 10 –  S u m m a r y                                          9 4

10.2.3. AEOPs processes  
In present work the Anox/H 2O2Cath/UV process was investigated in two combinations:         
the electrolysis cell was combined with the CSTR or the large PFR. In the EC Electro MP-
Cell the  direct oxidation took place on the anode, while the hydrogen peroxide was 
generated on the cathode. In the reactors the UV radiation led to the EDTA photolysis or to H
2O2 irradiation and •OH radicals formation. The combination with the CSTR was much more 
effective – the total EDTA degradation was achieved after 150 minutes in the first run of the experiment, in the second run at that time a value of 80% EDTA-decomposition was reached. In case of the large PFR after 300 mi nutes only 70 % of EDTA was degraded in the 
first run and 82 % in the second one. 
To sum up, the investigations performed with the application of various AOPs showed, that 
the Fe(II)-EDTA photolysis seemed to be the most effective method for EDTA degradation, mainly because of its high extinction coefficient and the ability to absorb UV radiation. The Anox/H
2O2/UV method with a combination of EC Electro MP-Cell  and the CSTR with its high 
reaction rate constant seems to be efficient, however its relatively large specific energy demand has to be taken into account. Direct oxidation on the anode did not yield expected results. Although the specific energy demand in this case is situated in a reasonable range,  
a very low rate constant of the EDTA-degradation excludes this method from being recommended.
