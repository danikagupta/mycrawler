Keywords:  Biodegradable, Biosorbent, Cationic Dyes, Carcinogenic, Solvent Extraction and Fenton’s ReagentAbstract
Objectives: To explore most suitable and efficient method for the removal of dyes from textile effluent. Methods/
Statistical Analysis: In this paper, scattered information of research work carried out by many researchers related to 
various methods for the removal of cationic dyes especially Rhodamine-B, Methylene Blue, Crystal Violet, Malachite Green and Safranin-O dye present in textile effluent have been compiled and compared to find out cheap and effective method by calculating their percentage removal. Findings/Recommendations:  It has been found that among all the methods 
reported so far,  Adsorption process show promising results and overcomes almost all the demerits of otherwise efficient methods  like advanced oxidation and electro coagulation etc. in terms of high cost and sludge problem. So ,the use of  natural adsorbents and agricultural/industrial waste materials especially modified flyash, red mud ,activated rice husk , surfactant modified alumina, bentonite clay  as adsorbents is recommended for the removal of cationic dyes since they are of less cost/ no cost, easily available and have great affinity for dyes. Moreover, agriculture/industrial waste often poses a disposal 
problem. So, their use (after chemical treatment) as adsorbent is environmental friendly. Applications/Improvements:  
This review paper would be helpful to find the most promising method for the removal of cationic dyes from the textile 
effluent considering the merits and demerits of each method. Much work has been done to explore the most effective and cheap method for the removal of dyes recently but not under the range of operating conditions. In future, more methods need to be explored to study and check removal of dyes from real textile effluent at the industrial level as the dye effluent also contains other harmful pollutants. Attention is to be paid to develop cheaper and more efficient adsorbents from the agriculture/ industrial waste with some modification which would be cost effective. Moreover, management of exhausted adsorbents is also to be taken care of. 
1. Introduction
Textile manufacturing is one of the ever developing 
industrial areas that discharge heavy loaded chemicals 
during dyeing process that leads to special environment 
concern. Huge amount of water has been consumed by 
textile industry that at the last discharged off, fully loaded 
with organic pollutants, acid, bases, heavy metal ions and 
dyes etc.1 Textile industry has replaced natural colouring 
pigments (used earlier) with new fast colouring agents as they last longer even if exposed to heat, light, water, pro-viding bright colours, but they contribute a lot to water 
pollution.2
Dyes are basically organic compounds that get 
attached to the surface of the fabric to impart color, com-
monly known as coloring agents. They are water soluble, 
producing bright colors in water with acidic properties. 
Dyes are widely used in many industries that include 
paper, printing, textile, food, cosmetic and many others. 
Researchers rose to formulate new color compounds that 
would impart permanent bright color to the fabric but, these chemicals and their breakdown products are highly Indian Journal of Science and Technology Vol 11 (12) | March 2018 | www.indjst.org 2
Various Methods for Removal of Dyes from Industrial Effluents - A Reviewtoxic and carcinogenic. Moreover, they resist to aerobic 
biodegradation, causing challenge to the environmental 
researchers. They remain in the environment for long 
time period hence decreases the aesthetic value of water 
bodies along with environment hazards.3 Figure 1 shows 
the schematic representation of the effects of textile efflu-ents when discharged into the environment. 
Figure 1. Schematic representation of the effects of textile 
effluents when discharged into the environment.The dyes used in the Textile industry are classified as 
such-4
1. Cationic dyes- include basic dyes.
2. Anionic dyes- include acid dyes, reactive dyes, azo 
dyes, direct dyes.
3. Non-ionic dyes- includes disperse dyes that do not ion-
ize in aqueous media.
Table 1 represents the details of some target dyes con-
sidered for present study.
Most current techniques used  for the removal of dyes 
falls under three main classes-5
1. Physical methods (includes process of adsorption 
involving natural adsorbents, agricultural and indus-
trial adsorbents, surfactants.) 
2. Chemical methods (includes advanced oxidation 
method using Fenton’s reagent, hydrogen peroxide, ozonization, solvent-extraction method andelectro-
coagulation etc.)

2. Chemical Methods for Dye 
Removal
2.1 Advanced Oxidation Process
Advanced oxidation method is one of the traditional 
methods that have been applied for de-colorization pro-
cess. It is based on the mechanism involving generation of 
hydroxyl radicals (as oxidising agents), that when attack 
upon chromo-genic groups, leads to produce organic per -
oxide radicals and ultimately transform them into CO2, 
H20 and inorganic salts.6 It consists of a variety of meth-
ods such as ozonisation, use of hydrogen peroxide and Fenton’s process that has been discussed here.
6
2.2 Using Hydrogen Peroxide
Hydrogen peroxide has attained prominent position 
among oxidising agents because of its commercial avail-
ability and is cheap and friendly oxidant. It can be used 
for the oxidation process directly or in combination with 
catalysts or with UV radiation.7,8 H2O2 readily undergoes 
reaction with hydrated electron from the water radiolysis reaction, that leads to formation of OH* radical.
     H
2O2     +     e-
aq      -------›      OH*      +       OH
Degree of degradation by addition of H2O2 increases 
with the greater attribution of OH* radical, as OH* radi-
cal formed degrade the dye chromophore efficiently.9,10
However, some drawbacks have also been found 
with its use as it fails to oxidize some organic pollut-
ants. It has been investigated by that removal efficiency 
for Methylene Blue dye was found to be 86% with this reagent.
11 Hydrogen pero xide reagent is also found to be 
effective for the removal of Rhodamine –B dye with 99% 
efficiency as reported.12
2.3 Using Fenton’s Reagent
The mixture of hydrogen peroxide and ferrous ion (Fe+2) 
is known as Fenton’s reagent. Use of Fenton’s reagent is one of the advanced oxidation process that has been 
examined for the removal of various dyes. This method 
involves oxidation of organic pollutants, following oxida-tively degradation by hydroxyl radical that is generated 
from H2O2 in presence of Fe+2 as a catalyst.13,14,15
Fe2+      +        H2O2 ---------›       OH*     +   OH-
A rapid reaction occurs between ferrous ion and 
H2O2 with the generation of radical hydroxyl.13-15 The 
efficiency of this process depends upon concentration 
of H2O2 and Fe2+ ions and on pH factor. As reported by 
some researchers, pH should be in between 3-5.13-15 The 
oxidation method using Fenton’s reagent completely degrade the contaminants and break down them into 
harmless compounds like CO
2, H2O and inorganic salts.16 
Moreover,  this method is easy to carry out, completely 
reacts with organic compounds, is low cost treatment and 
do not produce any toxic compounds during the reac-
tion.  But, still then its applications has been found to be 
limited as generation of ferric hydroxide sludge in excess amount remains a disposal problem.
17 This advanced 
oxidation method was found to be quite effective in case 
of Malachite Green dye with 99% removal efficiency as 
reported in the study.18 For the removal of Crystal violet 
dye removal efficiency has been found to be 98.2% with 
Fenton’s reagent as reported in the literature.19
2.4 Ozonisation Process
Ozone, known as the most powerful oxidant than other 
oxidising agents like Cl2, H2O2. Ozone is found to be quite 
capable in oxidising chlorinated hydrocarbons, phenols 
and some other hydro carbons. The reaction mechanism 
involves two steps. Step 1 involves reaction occurring at 
pH value of 5-6, where ozone is present as in form of O3 
and undergoes reaction with double bond of dye mol-ecules selectively. Step 2 involves reaction taking place 
at higher pH value i.e. above 8 pH, where ozone readily 
undergoes decomposition generating hydroxyl radicals 
that reacts non-selectively with organic compounds.
20
Ozonization has been found successful in remov-
ing dyes from textile effluents.21,22 According to some 
researchers, reactive class of dyes show high extent of 
degradation with O3 while, results found are moderate 
in case of basic dyes and poor results in case of disperse 
dyes.23 The major advantag e of this method is the applica-
tion of ozone in its gaseous state and there is no sludge 
generation which makes it a effective tool of decolouriza-
tion but, its high cost and short half-life are the barriers 
associated with ozonization process.20,24 Nearly about 98% 
removal efficiency has been found for Rhodamine-B dye with ozonization method.

Various Methods for Removal of Dyes from Industrial Effluents - A Review2.5 Electro-Coagulation Process
A simple, reliable electro-coagulation technique has been 
found to be effective tool in the removal of dyes with 
promising better results. The method involves 3 stages. 
Stage 1 involves generation of coagulants after oxida-
tion of sacrificial anodic electrodes. 
Stage 2 involves destabilization of pollutants and 
emulsions break out.
Stage 3 involves formation of flocs.
Figure 2 shows the diagrammatic representation of 
different stages of electro-coagulation process stage wise.
Figure 2. The diagrammatic representation of different 
stages of electro-coagulation process stage wise.
This method involves coagulants formation within 
the reactor site without the help of any external agency. 
Formation of coagulants is followed by oxidation of sac-
rificial anodic electrodes like Aluminium, Iron, stainless 
steel and many others, which further results in formation 
of hydroxyl species that helps to neutralize electrostatic 
charge of solids and enhancing the rate of agglomeration. 
The process is found to be quite effective in the removal of contaminants, colloidal particles, metal ions and dyes.
26
Mechanism involving Aluminium electrode-
Upon oxidation, Al tends to produce aluminium 
hydroxide ions which further polymerises to form Al (OH)
3n species.26

tion.26Fe -------›    Fe+2 (aq)        +     2e-anodic reaction

Overall reaction-
Fe (s) +      2H20 (l)   ------›    Fe (OH)2 (s)     +   H2 (aq)
The ferrous hydroxide formed acts as a coagulant that 
binds the organic pollutants by electrostatic attractions 
and removes them through coagulation phenomena.27
For the removal of Methylene Blue dye, iron elec-
trodes were found to be more efficient with 100% removal 
efficiency28 and 96% removal efficiency with Fe-Al elec-
trodes.28 About 80% removal efficiency for Methylene 
blue dye has been notified with use of Fe electrode alone.29 
For the removal of Malachite Green dye, stainless steel as 
an electrode was found to be more effective with 99.5% 
removal efficiency.30 Al electrodes have been also tried for 
the removal of Malachite green & Crystal violet dyes with 85% and 99.75% efficiency respectively.

2.5.2 Electrocoagulation in Combination with 
Adsorption
In order to retard the generation of toxic chlorinated 
organic byproducts during the treatment process of 
dyes, it has been preferred to follow electro coagulation- 
adsorption technique, which is found to be more safe and efficient for the removal of dyes. Moreover, it avoids the 
periodical replacement of sacrificial anodes which oth-
erwise would be costly affair.
33 A widely used adsorption 
technique is basically the accumulation of organic pollut-
ant called adsorbate onto the surface of adsorbing phase 
called adsorbent.34 For achieving better results for the 
removal of cationic and anionic dyes, a electro coagula-
tion technique in combination with adsorption process 
has been carried out. Fe electrodes in combination with activated carbon and sludge derived carbonaceous mate-
rial have been examined for Malachite green dye with 
99.2% and 99.1% efficiency respectively.
35 For the removal 
of Methylene dye Al and stainless steel have been used 
as electrodes in combination with Banana peels to carry 
out dye extraction process with 99% removal efficiency.36 
Not only better dye removal efficiency but it is also found  
to be helpful in reducing sewage sludge pollution. Table 
2 represents the removal efficiency of dyes with different electrodes through electro-coagulation process.Indian Journal of Science and Technology5

2.6 Solvent-Extraction Method
A newly investigated technique solvent extraction either 
solid-liquid or liquid-liquid extraction has been intro-
duced with maximum extraction efficiency for the 
extraction of dyes from textile effluents. Solvent extrac-
tion is sig nificant potential for the dye removal from 
textile waste water. The basic principle involves distri-
bution of solute in certain ratio in b/w two immiscible 
solvents or we can say that mixing of known amount of 
dye phase in an aqueous phase and solvent phases. This 
method has been tried out for the removal of Methylene 
Blue dye using liquid-liquid extraction technique.37 For 
the extraction process, benzoic acid as diluent phase has 
been taken with xylene and toluene as extractants in 1:1 
extraction phase ratio providing the extraction efficiency 
of 99% and 95% respectively.37 For the removal of Crystal 
violet dye, Tributyl phosphate as extractant with diluents 1-Dodecanol in 1:1 extraction phase ratio has been tried 
out.
38 About 90% extraction efficiency has been found for 
Crystal violet dye with this method.38
 Solvent extraction 
method has been also investigated for the extraction of 
Malachite Green dye and it has been found 98.67% extrac-
tion of dye with this.39 To carry out the solvent extraction process xylene, chloroform, benzene, toluene and hex-ane were taken as diluents for o-chlorobenzoic acid (as 
extractant). But, xylene has been selected more efficient 
diluent for o-chlorobenzoic acid because it is little less 
harmful than others while almost equal removal efficiency 
has been reported with all of them. For the extraction of 
Malachite green dye. Solvent extraction process has also 
been carried out with 2-nitro benzoic acid as diluent for 
benzene (as extractant) and it has been observed 98.95% 
dye extraction at pH 7.
40 In the dye extraction process. 
Being Rhodamine-B a cationic dye, it has found that for its extraction it requires some kind of anionic carriers (as 
extractant). So, phenol that acts as phenoxide anionic car -
rier has been tested out as an extractant for the removal 
of Rhodamine-B dye. For the diluent phase, xylene has 
been tried out among all hydrocarbons because of its less toxicity than all oth ers. Hence, with this liquid –liquid 
extraction 97% dye extraction has been reported.
41 Some 
other researcher tried out corn oil and soyabean oil as 
diluents for tributyl phosphate (as extractant) with 96% 
and 95.4% extraction efficiency respectively.42 Therefore, 
selection of diluents and extractant determines the 
removal efficiency of dye and of extraction process which 
in turn also depends on its mass of transfer rate.43
Ease of operating and high purity is some of the 
advantageous associated with this technique that makes it 
another effective method of treatment.44 This process has 
been found more advantageous as solvent recovery and dye recovery is possible in this dye extraction process. 
2.7 Use of Surfactants in Solvent Extraction
Removal of dyes has also been reported by using sol-
vent extraction method using surfactants. Encapsulation 
of dye in Reverse micelle from aqueous phase with the 
separation of solvent phase results in separation of dye 
from water. The extraction of different ionic dyes such as 
Methylene blue, Malachite green, Rhodamine-B, Crystal 
violet and Safranin-O dyes from aqueous phase in the 
presence of different surfactants-cationic or anionic has 
been discussed in this present study. Reverse micelle have 
also achieved successful results in the protein extraction 
and in enzyme extraction by liquid-liquid extraction pro-cess.
45-48 Removal of dyes using reverse micelle allows the 
solvent and dye recovery using counterionic surfactants 
through back extraction process.49 Anionic surfactants like 
Sodium Dodecylbenzene Sulfonate (SDBS) and Sodium Indian Journal of Science and Technology Vol 11 (12) | March 2018 | www.indjst.org 6
Various Methods for Removal of Dyes from Industrial Effluents - A Reviewbis (2- ethyl) Sulfosuccinate (AOT) have been reported 
for the extraction of Methylene blue and Malachite green 
dyes.49 For Methylene blue dye, 98% and 97% extraction 
efficiency has been reported with 45mg SDBS/ 50ml amyl alcohol and 45mg AOT/ 50 ml amyl alcohol respectively. 
For Malachite green dye 59% and 65% extraction effi-
ciency has been studied with AOT/ isooctane and AOT/ 
methyl benzoate respectively. Rate of separation has been 
observed faster when amyl alcohol(polar medium) has 
been used as a solvent in comparison with benzyl alco-hol and methyl-benzoate.  Formation of interface at the 
bottom with the amyl alcohol as a solvent is lighter than 
water so moves upward, doing faster separation. This is 
because lighter solvent phase (with amyl alcohol) moves 
upward while heavier solvent phase (with benzyl alcohol and methyl benzoate) moves downwards. Hence, lower -
ing the rate of separation.
49
Table 3 shows the dye extraction efficiency with sol-
vent extraction method either solid-liquid extraction or 
liquid-liquid extraction.3. Physical Methods for the 
Removal of Dyes
3.1 Adsorption
Another most popular practice in the dye removal is 
Adsorption technique. This physico-chemical technique 
has been found to be most simple and economical for 
the removal of dyes from textile effluents.50 A number of 
low cost materials including agricultural waste material, 
naturally found material and industrial waste material 
have been tried out for the removal of dyes. Even though, 
the adsorption capacity with these adsorbents were not 
found much large but still they are widely needed as they 
are found to be cost effective, eco-friendly and somewhat 
effective.51 Various types of materials have been used as 
adsorbents. Some of them are reported here.

Vol 11 (12) | March 2018 | www.indjst.org Sangeeta Sharma and Amandeep KaurDye Removal
Industrial waste materials such as metal hydroxide 
sludge, fly ash, red mud, activated carbon, coal ash have 
been examined as low cost adsorbents to carry out de-
colorization process.
3.1.2 Using Activated Carbon
Activated carbon is one of the commonly adopted adsor -
bent material for the removal of organic pollutants from 
textile effluents.52,53 Dyes which are less soluble in water 
shows slow rate of adsorption on carbon content while, water soluble dyes like acidic-basic dyes and reactive 
dyes do not get readily adsorbed on carbon. The reason 
behind their poor adsorption is the polar nature of these 
dyes vs. non polar nature of carbon. Hence, adsorption 
on carbon would be less efficient when used alone. But, it 
becomes more efficient adsorbent when used along with coagulants. Although, Activated carbon has been found 
to be quite effective in removal of dyes but due to its high 
cost and loss of adsorbent during the deactivation, forces 
the researchers in seek of replacing it with some low cost 
adsorbents.
53
For the extraction of Malachite Green dye 49% 
removal efficiency has been reported.54 Activated car -
bon prepared from Durian seeds shows 48% removal 
efficiency for this dye and about 29% removal efficiency 
for Methylene Blue dye.55,56 Coal based activated carbon 
shows 33% adsorption efficiency for Malachite Green dye as reported in the study.
57 Nearly about 15% removal effi-
ciency was noticed with activated carbon prepared from oil palm fibres.
58 Activated carbon obtained from dead 
leaflets of Date Palm tree has been selected as renewable natural adsorbent material for the removal of Crystal vio-
let dye with 4% removal efficiency.
59
3.1.3 Using Sludge
Metal hydroxide sludge is one of the industrial waste materials that have been used as adsorbent for the sep-
aration of dyes from textile effluents. Hydroxide sludge 
contains hydroxide ions of metal and its salts.
60 For the 
Rhodamine-B dye, metal hydroxide sludge was found to 
have 4.2% adsorption as reported in the literature study.61
3.1.4 Using Red Mud
Red mud is other industrial waste material that has been 
tried out as adsorbent. Red mud has been discharged as bauxite processing residue during Alumina production.62 
Nearly about 34% removal efficiency has been reported 
with red mud for Malachite Green dye.63 It has been also 
investigated as most effective adsorbent for the removal of Safranin-O dye with 93.2% removal efficiency using Red 
mud.
64
3.1.5 Fly Ash
Fly ash is one of the industrial by-product that has been used for the removal of dyes. Baggase fly ash is one of the 
by-product of sugar industry which is cheaply available 
in plenty. It has been examined as suitable adsorbent as 
fly ash of sugarcane baggase does not contain any toxic 
metal. Baggase fly ash has been tried out as adsorbent for 
the removal of Malachite Green dye form aqueous solu-
tion with 17% adsorption.
65 For the Safranin-O dye very 
less removal efficiency was observed with this i.e. 0.2% 
removal efficiency.66 NaOH modified flyash has also been 
examined with 93% removal efficiency for the Crystal violet dye.
67
4. Naturally Occurring Adsorbents 
for Dye Removal
4.1 Using Clay
Clay is one of the naturally available adsorbent that has 
been extensively used for the dye removal. It has been 
found to be effective adsorbent because of its layered 
structure that works as host material for adsorbents 
and its counter ions. Clay particles possess strong affin-
ity towards cations and anions as its surface area have 
exchangeable ions that play an important role in adsorp-
tion phenomena.68
Low cost powder form of Kaolin Clay has been 
used as adsorbent for the removal of Malachite Green, 
Rhodamine-B and Safranin-O dyes with 7%, 5% and 2% 
respectively.69-71 Bentonite Clay has been tried out for the 
removal of Rhodamine-B with maximum adsorption of 83%, Methylene Blue with 99.9% removal efficiency.
72 
Malachite Green dye with 18% removal efficiency with the clay as adsorbent material.
73 One other class of Clay 
i.e. Algerian Clay has also been examined for the removal of Methylene Blue dye with 6% adsorption.
74 Local cat -
egory of clay has also been examined with 82% removal efficiency for the removal of Crytal violet dye.

Various Methods for Removal of Dyes from Industrial Effluents - A Review4.2 Surfactant Modified Clay
In order to enhance the adsorption capacity naturally 
available Montmorillonite Clay was made surfactant 
modified  Clay thereby amended with Hexadecyltrimethyl 
ammonium bromide (HDTMA) and hexadecylpyridin-
ium chloride (HDPy)- a cationic surfactants and with 
the application of surfactant modified clay 28% and 30% 
removal efficiency has been noticed for Methylene blue  
and Malachite green dyes.76
4.3 Surfactant Modified Alumina
Alumina surface was modified with the use of sodium 
dodecyl sulphate for waste water treatment. This surfac-
tant modified alumina was tried out as a adsorbent for 
the removal of Malachite Green dye with 99% efficiency.77 
The removal efficiency of alumina modified with sodium dodecyl sulphate- an anionic surfactant has also been 
examined with 99% extraction for Crystal violet dye.
78
4.4 Peat 
Peat, one of the porous adsorbent materials found nat-
urally has been tried out for the removal of various 
organic pollutants and dyes. It has been investigated as an 
adsorbent for the removal of Rhodamine-B from indus-
trial effluents but only 8.6% removal efficiency has been 
reported.79
5. Agricultural Waste Material as 
Adsorbent for Dye Removal
Agricultural waste materials are cheap and easily available 
adsorbents that have greater potential for the removal of 
dyes. The utilization of these agricultural residues play a 
significant role in decolourization process and in national 
economy.80 Some of these agricultural adsorbents have 
been discussed as such.
5.1 Using Casuarina equisetifolia Needle 
(CEN)
Casuarina equisetifolia  needle also known as Australian 
pine tree is a non-leguminous plant.  It can be easily pro-
cessed into powder form for the process of adsorption 
because of its brittleness.81 Moreover, it contain ligno-
cellulosic material that play its role for the adsorption 
of pollutant material. Hence, it has been chosen for the 
removal of organic pollutants. Casuarina equisetifolia  needle has been used as a adsorbent for the removal of Rhodamine-B dye with 8.2% dye removal efficiency.

5.2 Durian Seeds
Durian fruit belongs to Bombacaceae family, one of the popular seasonal fruit. Inedible part of fruit that includes 
seeds and outer skin usually discarded as waste material. 
This discarded material possesses a unique characteristic 
of adsorbent. It has been tried out as an adsorbent for the 
removal of Malachite Green dye with removal efficiency 
of 48%.

5.3 Annona squamosa Seeds
Annona squamosa  seeds were of hedge plant, which bears 
delicious fruit full of nutrition and non-edible seed part were used to discard. Later on, it was investigated as an 
adsorbent material for the removal of Malachite Green and Methylene Blue dye . About 26% adsorption was 
observed for Malachite Green dye but very less adsorp-tion i.e. 9% for the Methylene Blue dye has been notified.
83
5.4 Bread Nut
One of the other low cost adsorbent bread nuts has been investigated for the removal of Malachite Green dye. 
Bread nut is basically an Artocorpus fruit. The seeds of 
this fruit were edible part while core and skin cover were 
non-edible which, were discarded as waste. This dis-
carded waste fruit peels possess property of adsorption 
towards Malachite Green dye. Hence, nearly about 35% 
removal efficiency has been notified with NaOH treated bread nut.
84
5.5 Rice Straw
Rice straw is agricultural residue used as an adsorbent material. It consists of cellulose (37.4%), hemicellulose 
(45%), lignin (5%) and silica ash (13.1%). For the removal of Malachite Green dye, rice straw has been used as a 
adsorbing material and found that unmodified rice straw shows less adsorption i.e. 9% while, rice straw on treat-
ing with citric acid shows more adsorption i.e. 26% for 
Malachite Green dye.

of Dyes using Various Methods
7.1 Removal of Rhodamine B Dye
The Rhodamine B dye is synthetic class of dye that has 
been widely used as a colouring agent in the textile and 
food manufacturing industry.107 Exposure to this dye 
leads to many health effects like subcutaneous tissue 
borne sarcoma which is carcinogenic.108 Many other 
kinds of toxicity have also been medically proven like reproductive and neurotoxicity.
108 The no. of adsorbents 
that have been tried out for its removal has been illus-trated in Table 5. Dye removal efficiency for Rhodamine 
–B dye has been found to be maximums with chemical method involving advanced oxidation process and sol-
vent extraction method. Removal efficiency of 98% was 
found with ozonizationtechnique and with hydrogen per -
oxide reagent.
12,25 More than 95% dye removal efficiency 
has been observed with liquid/liquid extraction involv-
ing xylene with phenol, tributyl phosphate with corn oil 
and soyabean oil.41,42 Removal efficiency with biological 
method was found to be maximums with P . monteilii  
and Comamonas testosterone bacterial species i.e. 56%.90 
Other bacterial species named as Pseudomonas putida  
and P .plecoglossicida shows 55% removal efficiency for 
the removal of Rhodamine-B dye while 50% removal 
efficiency was observed for Aeromonas hydrophilla  sp 
one of other biosorbent Pencillium  was found to possess 
11% removal efficiency when treated with cetlpridinium 
chloride and 9% removal efficiency with untreated pen-
cillium.109 Nearly about 34% dye removal efficiency has 
been examined with Cucumis sativus one of the agricul-
tural adsorbent.86 Among natural adsorbents Bentonite 
clay was found to be more efficient with 83% removal effi-
ciency whereas, only 5% adsorption was observed with 
Kaolinite clay.70,72 Other natural adsorbent Peat shows 
only 8.6% adsorption for this dye.79 Among agricultural 
adsorbents CEN shows 8.2% adsorption and Shorea dasy -
phylla  shows 2.4% adsorption.89,110 Very less extraction of 
dye has been noticed in case of industrial adsorbents like 
4.2% dye removal efficiency with metal hydroxide sludge 
and 2% dye removal efficiency with anaerobic sludge and 
0.3% with coal ash and with agricultural adsorbent like 
coffee ground powder with 0.5% dye removal efficiency 
for Rhodamine-B dye.61,111,112 Table 5 Shows the dye removal efficiency for Rhodamine-B dye with different 
reagents/ adsorbents/ biosorbents.

7.2 Removal of Malachite Green Dye  
Malachite Green dye is cationic type dye which is water 
soluble and appears in green crystalline powder form.113 Indian Journal of Science and Technology Vol 11 (12) | March 2018 | www.indjst.org 12
Various Methods for Removal of Dyes from Industrial Effluents - A ReviewIt is used as a dye material in leather, silk, paper, paint and 
printing industry.113 Other than industries we may also 
find its use to catch thieves and pilferers. This powder is 
usually sprinkled on money and anybody handling this 
money will find that upon washing the hands, it leaves 
green stains on the skin that longs for many days.114 The 
number of adsorbents that has been tried out for its removal have been listed in the Table 5. More than 98% 
dye removal efficiency has been notified with chemical 
treatment of dye extraction involving reagents and elec-
trodes like 99.5% extraction with the use of stainless steel 
as electrodes, 99.2% extraction with the use of iron elec-
trode, 99% extraction with use of Fenton’s reagent.
18,30,35 
Maximum extraction of dye has also been observed 
with solvent extraction using surfactants such as use of 
orthochloro benzoic acid with chloroform, xylene, and benzene as extractants.
39 Extraction of Malachite green 
dye has also been carried with the use of bacteria, algae 
and fungi sp. with better dye extraction efficiency i.e 97% 
efficiency with Ischnoderma resinosum , 96% efficiency 
with Fusarium solani , Aspergillus flavus , Alternaria solani, 
Kurthia sp.  92% efficiency with Chlorella sp., 77% effi-
ciency with Lysinbacillus fusiformis and 50% efficiency 
with P . plecoglossicida .90,93,100,101,102,106 Activated carbon 
has been observed with 49% dye removal efficiency and 
activated carbon derived from Durian seed has been 
observed with 48% efficiency.54-55 Dye removal efficiency 
with 33% has been observed with the use of industrial 
adsorbents such as red mud and coal based activated car -
bon and 15-17% efficiency with the use of baggase flyash  
and oil palm fibre activated carbon as industrial adsor -
bents57,58,63,65. A class of clay if modified with surfactants 
tends to show 29% removal efficiency for Malachite green dye.
76 Agricultural adsorbents have been examined with 
26% dye removal efficiency with the application of A. squ-mosa  and rice straw when treated with citric acid.
83,85 Dye 
removal efficiency ranging b/w 3-6% has been noticed with saw dust (NaOH treated)
 and rice husk( treated with 
peroxide) when used as agricultural adsorbents and with 
fly ash when used as industrial adsorbent in dye extrac-
tion process. Nearly about 2% dye removal efficiency has 
been examined for Malachite green dye when wheat bran and sugarcane baggase
 have been used as agricultural 
adsorbents, Ca (OH)2 treated fly ash used as industrial 
adsorbent.116,118,119,120 Least removal efficiency has been 
notified with waste pea shell i.e. only 1%.121 Among agri -
cultural waste materials Pine saw dust has been also tried 
as adsorbent for the removal of Malachite green dye and reported dye removal efficiency is 37%.122 Table 6 shows 
the dye removal efficiency for Malachite green dye with various adsorbents/ reagents/ biosorbents.

7.3 Removal of Crystal Violet Dye 
Crystal violet dye is also known as Methyl violet 10B 
dye. It is triaryl methane dye, having anti-bacterial, anti-
fungal and anthelmintic properties.123 The dye has been 
used in paper dyeing industry and also as a component of 
blue-black inks for printing. But, it has also been reported 
as recalcitrant dye molecule with long time persistence in 
the environment. Hence, it is reported as mitotic poison, 
potent carcinogenic and clastogene that promotes growth 
of tumor.123 Hence, number of adsorbents/ reagents/ bio-
sorbents have been tested for its removal. Dye removal efficiency has been found to be maximum i.e more than 
90% with electro-coagulation process using Al elec-
trodes with Fenton’s reagent, with surfactant modified alumina, and with NaOH modified flyash.19,32,67,78 Among 
the bio sorbents more dye removal efficiency has been 
noticed with fungal sp. than bacterial sp. such as 99.6% 
with Ischnoderma resinosum , 96% with Fusarium solani  
94% with Proteus vulgaris fungal sp. whereas 91% with Aeromonas hydrophila , 89% with Micrococcus lylae
 and 
80% with Pseudomonas putida .94-97,100,101 Tendu leaf one of 
the agricultural adsorbent has been found with 7% extrac-
tion efficiency for Crystal violet dye.124 Least dye removal 
efficiency has been noticed with Cucumis sativus, other agricultural adsorbent.

Various Methods for Removal of Dyes from Industrial Effluents - A Review7.4 Removal of Methylene Blue Dye
Methylene Blue is also known as methylthioninium chlo-
ride. Some medicinal properties have also been observed 
for Methylene Blue dye as it has been used to treat uri-
nary tract infections. But, high exposure leads to many 
health hazards like vomiting, headache, breathing prob-
lems and other allergic reactions.125,126 Therefore, variety 
of adsorbents, reagents and bio sorbents has been tried 
out for its removal. Some of them have been listed below 
in the Table 7. Highest dye removal efficiency i.e. 100% 
has been observed with electro-coagulation process using 
Fe electrodes.28 More than 90% dye removal efficiency has 
been observed with bentonite clay72 Al and stainless steel 
electrodes (in couple with banana peels) xylene with ben-
zoic acid involving solvent extraction process use of amyl 
alcohol with SDBS/AOT in liquid-liquid extraction pro-
cess and Fe-Al electrodes in electro-coagulation.28,36,37,49 
H2O2 reagent has been observed with 86% dye removal 
efficiency.11 Among bio-sorbents Pseudomonasaeruginosa 
shows 82%, Aspergillus fumigates shows 80%, Pseudomonas 
putida  shows 69%, 40% with Aeromonas hydrophila and 
Comamonas testosterone .90,91,99 A class of clay if surfactant 
modified tends to show 29% dye removal efficiency.76 
Pomelo has been reported for extraction of this dye with 34% efficiency.
127 Agricultural adsorbent, bark powder of 
Teak Tree has been tried out for extraction process, show-ing 33% efficiency.
128 Fruit peels have also been tried out 
for dye extraction process but they show poor dye removal efficiency. It has been noticed that Jack fruit peels show 
29% efficiency, Guava peel shows 19% efficiency, bread 
bean peels show 19% efficiency and pine apple stem has 
been found with 12% removal efficiency for Methylene 
Blue dye.
129-132. One other untreated Parthenium hystro-
phorous  weed has been examined with 2.4% removal 
efficiency for this dye.133 Table 8 represents the removal 
efficiency of various adsorbents/ reagents/ biosorbents for the removal of Methylene blue dye.

Vol 11 (12) | March 2018 | www.indjst.org Sangeeta Sharma and Amandeep Kaur7.5 Removal of Safranin –O Dye 
Safranin-O dye is one of the basic dye also known as 
basic red-2. Amorphous powder form of Safranin-O dye 
is highly soluble in water and form stable salts of mono-
acids. Wide application of this dye was notified in textile 
industry but contributes to toxicity in water bodies when 
discharged off.134 So variety of the adsorbents have been 
tried out for its removal. Some of them have been dis-
cussed below. Like one of the industrial adsorbent Red 
Mud was found to be effective for decolourization of this 
dye with 93.2% removal efficiency.64 Among agricultural 
adsorbents 82% removal efficiency has been noticed with activated rice husk when tried out as a adsorbent mate-
rial
 Biosorbents such as Fomitopsis carnea and Pencillium 
expansum fungal sp. shows 76% and 41% removal effi-
ciency whereas Aeromonas hydrophila  bacterial sp. 
shows 70% removal efficiency for this dye.98,104,105,135 Seeds 
of mango have been also examined for the removal of 
Safranin-O dye. Nearly about 4.3% removal efficiency in 
case of treated mango seeds while 3.4% removal efficiency 
in case of untreated mango seeds has been notified136. 
Very less removal efficiency has been notified with nat-ural adsorbents like only 2% adsorption with Kaolinite 
clay, and less than 0.4% adsorption with coffee ground 
and with fly ash.
66,71,137 Nearly about 4% removal efficiency 
has been notified with rice husk (agricultural adsor -
bent) when treated with NaOH.138 Table 9 represents the 
removal efficiency of various adsorbents/ reagents/ bio-sorbents  for the removal of Safranin-O dye.

8. Conclusion
Various methods such as adsorption, electrocoagulation, 
advanced oxidation method, solvent extraction and bio-
logical methods have been compared for the treatment 
of textile waste water. It has been concluded that removal 
of dyes with adsorption technique using low cost/no cost 
adsorbent materials like naturally occurring, agricultural 
and industrial waste materials, has been found to be more 
effective with better removal efficiency. By utilizing waste discharged residues as adsorbents thereby, would improve 
textile industry economically.
a) For the removal of Methylene Blue dye, Bentonite Clay 
one of the naturally occurring adsorbents has been 
found to be more effective with 99.9% removal effi-
ciency.
b) For the removal of Safranin-O dye, Red mud one of 
the industrial adsorbents and activated rice husk, agri-
cultural adsorbent, have been found to more effective 
with 93.2% and 82% removal efficiency respectively.
c) For the removal of Crystal Violet dye, modified alu-
mina and NaOH treated flyash (industrial adsorbent) have been found to be more effective with 99% and 
93% dye removal efficiency. 
d) For the removal of  Rhodamine-B dye, naturally occur -
ring Bentonite clay as adsorbent has been found to be 
more efficient with 83% removal efficiency.
e) For the removal of Malachite Green dye, surfactant 
modified alumina (with sodium dodecyl sulphate) has been found to be more efficient with maximum 
removal efficiency of 99%.
