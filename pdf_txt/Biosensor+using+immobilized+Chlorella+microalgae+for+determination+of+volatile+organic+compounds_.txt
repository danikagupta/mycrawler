Abstract 
A biosensor using Chlorella  microalgae immobilized on the membrane of an oxygen electrode 
has been designed to determine volatile organi c compounds (VOC) in the form of aerosols. A 
homemade controlled atmosphere chamber is constructed for perchlor oethylene detection. 
Monitoring of perchloroethylene is obtained by the measurement of the oxygen production 
during the algae photosynthetic process.

I. Introduction 
The need for early-warning systems to detect toxic compounds is well established for the 
protection of the environment. The wide variety of chemical structures involved makes biological techniques more effe ctive than physico-chemical meth ods to assess the toxicity of 
the various pollutants [ 1] and [ 2]. Biosensors operating in the workplace atmosphere can be 
used as 
a warning device so that immediate acti on can be taken to evacuate the workplace and 
to locate the source of release. However most biosensors using enzymes, immunoagents or microorganisms are effective in aqueous solutions [ 3], [ 4] and [ 5]. Our aim is to construct a 
biosen 
sor capable to respond to a toxic vo latile organic compound (VOC) such as 
perchloroethylene present in the form of aerosol. This VOC is often used in the form of vapour or aerosol for dry-cleaning and municipal treatment plant. It also affects the photosynthetic 
activity of Chlorella  microalgae [ 6] which is then used as a bioreceptor immobilized on an 
oxyg 
en electrode. 
II. Experimental 
The algal membrane is obtained from filtration of an algae suspension on a glass microfibre 
filter Whatman. The concentration of algae in suspension is previously determined by optical density (OD). A typical 10 ml of a suspension of OD=0.34 at 685 nm has been used for a 0.7 
cm
2 membrane. Algae were cultivated in our laboratory: the Chlorella vulgaris  strain (CCAP 
211/12) is purchased from The Culture Collection of Algae an d Protozoa at Cumbria, UK. 
The biosensor was constructed as previously described [ 7] from the combination of an algal 
me
mbrane associated with an oxygen Clark electrode to measure the release of photosynthetic 
oxygen. This gas is produced from the photosynthetic activi ty of the microalgae under 
illumination conditions and in the presence of  atmospheric carbon dioxide. Since the algal 
membrane is designed to work in the atmosphe re, a water reservoir is fixed to the electrode 
body to provide humidity for the algal cells to operate properly (Figure 1). An enclosed space is designed for aerosol detection. It consists of a homemade box which provides a 0.7m
3 controlled atmosphere chamber (Figu re 2). The wall is covered with 
aluminium foil to prevent interfering light from  outside. Temperature is maintained at 20°C 
and relative humidity at 75%. The biosensor is placed in the box and connected to an oxygen measuring device outside the cham ber. Periodical flashes of light are sent from a halogen light 
source (Schott KL 1500 Electronic 15 V/150 W) to the sensor through an optical fiber. Algae Sensors & Actuators 1999, 59(2-3), 100-102,  doi: 10.1016/S0925-4005(99)00203-8  
 
2 photosynthetic activity is measured during the illumination period and was recorded as a peak 
of oxygen production on the recorder chart. In  the absence of aerosol, the peak of oxygen 
release, H0, is recorded and taken as a reference. Wh en the toxic compound is sprayed in the 
controlled atmosphere chamber, the photosyn thetic activity changes which modifies the 
release of oxygen and consequently the peak height. After the measurements, the toxic 
containing atmosphere is completely removed th rough a large flexible tube (inner diameter 0.1 
m) connected to an air pump. 
III. Results 
The method is based on the modification of the photosynthetic activity in the presence of the 
a n a l y t e  u s e d  i n  t h e  f o r m  o f  a e r o s o l s .  T h i s  i s  t h e  c a s e  o f  p e r c h l o r o e t h y l e n e .  W h e n  
perchloroethylene is sprayed into the chambe r, the production of oxygen during the 
illumination period immediat ely changes and an increase ΔH in peak height is immediately 
observed (Figure 3). Perc hloroethylene is then an activator of  the algal photosynthetic activity. 
During the first 30 min approximately, the oxygen peak heights increase linearly with time. 
The dynamic response is proportional to th e concentration of perchloroethylene in the 
chamber if those concentrations  do not exceed 250 ppm (Figure 4). The dynamic response is 
defined as the ratio of the increase in peak heights to the time course: 
dynamic response= ΔH/Δt 
with ΔH=H−H0, Δt=t−t0, H0 is the reference response and t0 corresponds to the introduction 
of perchloroethylene. The dynamic response is then the change in oxygen production. 
The response time can be assessed from the increase in the peak height after spraying 
perchloroethylene in the controlled atmosphere  chamber. The perchlor oethylene is sprayed 
immediately after the illumination period and the measurement is done after 5-min darkness. 
Since the slope response is unchanged after this fi rst period of time, it can be considered that 
the response time of the biosensor itself is less than 5 min for the tested concentrations 
(Figure 3). Preliminary assays show that the biosensor response depend s on the thickness of 
the algal layer. 
The dynamic response of the algal biosensor as a function of perchloroe thylene concentrations 
is shown on Figure 4. The measurement is repeated three times for each concentration and the 
mean value is reported on the figure. The calibration curve can be considered as linear in the 
range of 0–250 ppm of perchlor oethylene. The straight line equation and the correlation 
coefficients shown on the graph are obtained with the least square method for six experimental points. The detection limit of the biosensor is dependent on the detection limit of the 
transducer which is the oxygen electrode. A concentration of 10 ppm perchloroethylene corresponding to a signal-to-noise ratio of 3, can be detected. As the limit value of workers 
exposure to perchloroethylene is 50 ppm [ 8], this biosensor could be used as an early-warning 
devic
e. 
The recovering of the biosensor activity is dependent upon the exposure conditions. The biosensor is not reversible for perchloroethylene concentr ation higher than 340 ppm. A 
decrease in oxygen production during the phot osynthetic process is observed day after day. 
Under the above mentioned conditions, and at room-temperature storag e, about 50% of the 
algal activity in terms of oxygen production still remains on the membrane biosensor after 8 
days. This could be improved by decreasing the light intensity which results in a longer 
response time. 
IV. Conclusion 
For the first time, an algal biosensor has been constructed to operate in the gas phase for determination of aerosols. It al lows direct determination in the gas phase without previous 
trapping the analyte in a solution. In addition, real-time monitoring is possible with 
continuous measurement of the algae photosynthetic activity by an oxygen electrode. Other 
toxic compounds (atrazine, paraquat or methan ol…) which affect the algal photosynthetic Sensors & Actuators 1999, 59(2-3), 100-102,  doi: 10.1016/S0925-4005(99)00203-8  
 
3 activity can also be detected by this biosensor.  Interference of other gaseous compounds is to 
be investigated.
