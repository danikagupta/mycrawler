 SUMMARY  
African trypanosomiasis is a disease restricted to sub -Saharian Africa and it 
assumes two forms: Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT or sleeping sickness) or Animal 
African trypanosomiasis (AAT or n’gana), both being fatal if untreated. While HAT causes 
an estimated  number of 15000 new cases each year and 70 million people are at risk, AAT 
causes an enormous economic burden due to livestock elimination [1]. 
HAT is caused by the  unicellular  Trypanosoma brucei  parasite, which is transmitted 
by the tsetse transmitting vector. Upon a tsetse blood meal , parasites are delivered into a 
mammalian host where they proliferate in the bloodstream, lymphatic system and inside 
preferred tissues, such as the adipose tissue [2]. The parasites can progressively migrate 
to the central nervous system, leading to neurological disorders, com a and death [3]. 
Each Trypanosoma brucei  parasite expresses a single type of Variant Surface 
Glycoprotein (VSG) at its  cell surface. To avoid being eliminated by the host immune 
system, parasites use antigenic variation, which consists in periodically changing to a new 
VSG coat, oblig ating the immune system to reinitiate a new adaptive response and 
generate new antibodies. VSG  gene s are transcribed by RNA polymerase I (Pol I) from 
specialized subtelomeric loci termed Bloodstream Expression Sites (BESs) [4]. Although 
there are around 15 BESs in the genome, only one is active at a ny given time , thus 
ensuring VSG monoallelic expression. Replacement of the VSG coat starts in the nucleus 
by changing the actively transcribed VSG. This process takes place through: i) switching by 
recombination , which involve s DNA recombination between t he active and a silent BES 
encompassing the VSG gene or  by copying a VSG sequence from archival copies present in 
the genome into the active BES [5, 6]; ii) in situ  switching, where the active BES becomes 
silenced with the concomitant activation of a silent BES [7, 8].  
VSG in situ  switching is very poorly understood. We do not know the key players 
or the sequence of events that regulate it. As the actively transcribed BES possess es a 
very open chromatin conformation relative to transcriptionally silent BES s [9, 10], we 
proposed to understand how chromatin and transcription interweave during an in situ  
switc hing.  II 
 Another event in which the active BES becomes  silenced is during differentiation 
from bloodstream to procyclic ( present in the tsetse) forms  [11]. In this situation, we 
observed that transcriptional silencing precedes chromatin changes. Thus, we postulated 
that during an in situ  switching event transcription is probably also halted prior to closing 
chromatin structure. We chose to use a tetracycline -inducible BES transcriptional 
silencing system from the Horn lab that induces VSG silencing [12], resul ting in an 
increase of the switching frequency to 8%. Blockage of transcription was confirmed by the 
absence of  Pol I in the active BES and le d to a rapid decrease in transcript levels of this 
locus within the first 8 hr after BES silencing. Despite such s ignificant changes at the 
transcriptional level, chromatin of the previously active BES remained in an open 
conformation. We hypothesized that the cell -cycle was necessary to induce chromatin 
remodeling as in Pol I -transcribed ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes in  yeast, but this revealed 
unfruitful.  
We observed that TDP1 (Trypanosome DNA -binding protein 1), an essential high 
mobility group box protein [13, 14], remain ed in the active BES even after BES silencing 
had been triggered. Depletion  of TDP1 in these conditions le d to closure of chromatin 
indicating that TDP1 is a key factor in stabilizing open chromatin conformation under 
transcriptional switching. We showed that during  in situ  switching, cells probe more than 
one silent BES, inclusively expressing other VSGs. We determined that after 24 hr of BES 
silencing, roughly half of the cells were committed to switch while the remaining could 
revert to transcrib e the initial BES. Interestingly, cells that at 24 hr of BES silencing were 
not probing a specific BES (and VSG) d id not switch to that BES. Overall, these results led 
us to propose a model in which under an in situ  switching, transcription of the active BES 
is halted but its chromatin is maintained in an open conformation by TDP1. This allows 
parasites to probe silen t BES to make a decision of switching or returning to the initial 
BES.  
The importance of TDP1 in Pol I transcription and in the switching process led us 
to ask if TDP1 overexpression could interfere with  VSG monoallelic expression. Using a 
TDP1 -overexpress ing cell -line, we observed that genome -wide chromatin becomes more 
open (at different extent) except in the active BES and rDNA genes, suggesting  that these 
two loci already have the chromatin fully open. Furthermore, the mRNA transcript levels III 
 only increa sed in silent BES, MES (Metacyclic Expression Sites) and procyclin loci 
confirming the role of TDP1 as a Pol I transcription facilitator [14]. Importantly, we 
observed the expression of a silent VSG upon TDP1 overexpression confirming the 
disruptio n of monoallelic expression.  
Overall, this dissertation enlightens the relevance of chromatin during an in situ  
switching  and elucidates the roles of TDP1 as key factor for antigenic variation.

 RESUMO  
A tripanossomíase Africana é uma doença restrita à África subsariana e que 
assume duas formas: tripanossomíase Humana Africana (THA ou doença do sono) ou 
tripanossomíase Animal Africana (TAA ou n’gana ), sendo ambas fatais quando não 
tratadas. Enquanto que a THA causa, anualmente, um número estimado de 15000 novos 
casos, encontrando -se 70 milhões de pessoas em risco de contrair a doença, a AAT 
provoca um enorme fardo económico devido à eliminação de gad o [1]. 
A THA é causada pelo parasita Trypanosoma brucei  que é transmitido pelo vetor 
de transmissão denominado tsé -tsé, uma mosca do gén ero Glossina . Durante a refeição 
sanguínea da tsé -tsé, os parasitas são injetados no hospedeiro mamífero onde proliferam 
na corrente sanguínea, sistema linfático e no interior de tecidos preferenciais, tal como o 
tecido adiposo [2]. Os parasitas podem progressivamente migrar pa ra o sistema nervoso 
central, causando problemas neurológicos, coma e morte [3]. 
Cada parasita expressa  cerca de 10 milhões de cópias de uma proteína 
denominada  Variant Surface Glycoprotein  (VSG) à superfície da célula.  Apesar do genoma 
do parasita conter  cerca de 2000 genes que codificam para VSGs, apenas um gene, e 
consequentemente um tipo de proteína, é expresso a cada momento.  Para evitar a 
eliminação pelo sistema imune do hospedeiro, os parasitas usam o mecanismo de  
variação antigénica, que consiste na mudança periódica para uma nova cobertura de VSG, 
obrigando o sistema imune a re -iniciar uma nova resposta adaptativa e a gerar novos 
anticorpos. As VSGs são transcritas pela RNA polimerase I (Pol I) a partir de locais  
subteloméricos especializados denominados Bloodstream Expression Sites (BESs) [4]. 
Apesar de existirem  cerca de  15 BESs no genoma, apenas um se encontra ativo a cada 
momento , estando os restantes silenciados,  assegurando a expressão monoalélica de 
VSGs. A substituição da cobertura de V SGs começa no núc leo através da mudança da VSG 
ativamente transcrita. Este processo pode ocorrer através de: i) recombinação de DNA , 
no qual ocorr e troca de sequência genómica de VSG  entre o BES ativo e um  BES silenciado  
ou através da cópia  e inserção no B ES ativo  de uma sequência genómica de VSG que se 
encontr e em regiões genómicas  destinadas ao  arquivo de  genes  VSG [5, 6]; ii) mudança in 
situ, onde o BES ativo  é silenciado com a concomitante ativação de um BES silenciado [7, 
8]. VI 
 A mudança in situ  de VSG é pouco compreendida. Não se conhecem os fatores 
chave, nem sequer a sequência de eventos que estão envolvidos n esta mudança. O BES 
ativo é altamente transcrito  e possui uma conformação de crom atina aberta , composta 
de muito poucos nucleossomas.  Os BESs silenciados  são pouco transcri tos e apenas na 
zona do promotor . A sua cromatina é fechada,  compacta e repleta de nucleos somas  [9, 
10]. Dada a correlação entre taxa de transcrição e conformação de cromatina , neste 
trabalho propomo -nos a compreender como é que a cromatina e transcrição interagem  e 
são modificadas  durante uma mudança in situ  de VSG.  
Um outro momento em que o BES ativo  é silenciado ocorre  durante a 
diferenciação  do parasita  da forma sanguínea  (no mamífero ) para a  forma  procíclica (na 
tsé-tsé). Neste processo,  todos os VSGs são silenciados,  para dar lugar a prociclínas nas 
superfície da célula . Nesta situação, observámos que o silenciamento da transcrição 
precede alterações na  estrutura da  crom atina. Desta forma, postulámos que durante uma 
mudança in situ , a transcrição é , também , provavelmente suspensa antes da estrutura da 
cromatina ser fechada. Para podermos estudar a relação transcrição/cromatina durante 
uma mudança de VSG in situ , modificám os geneticamente uma linha repórter 
inicialmente desenvolvida  no laboratório Horn [12]. Nesta linha celular, a transcrição do  
BES ativo é bloqueada  através de um sistema indutível de tetraciclína, sendo que , para 
sobreviverem , os parasitas necessita m de mudar a transcrição para outro BES e expressar 
outro VSG à superfície da célula.  Começámos por verificar que todas as células alteram o 
VSG que expressam mas apenas  8% das células sobrevivem, sendo esta frequência 100 a 
10000 vezes superior  ao previamente observado . O bloqueio da transcrição foi 
confirmado pela ausência de Pol I no BE S ativo  e pelo  rápido  decréscimo nos níveis de 
transcritos desta região nas primeiras 8 horas após o silenciamento do BES. Apesar de 
alterações significativas a nível transcricional, a cromatina do BES previamente ativo  
manteve -se numa conformação aberta. De seguida, t estámos se o ciclo celular era 
importante para induzir uma reestruturação da cromatina, tal como o DNA ribossomal 
(rDNA) transcrito pela Pol I em leveduras, mas esta hipótese revelou -se infrutífera.  
Antes do início desta dissertação , já tinha sido demonstrado que a  TDP1 
(Trypanosome DNA -binding protein 1 ) é uma prote ína de grupo com grande mobilidade , 
essencial ao parasita  e que está presente em regiões genómicas transcritas pela Pol I   [13, VII 
 14]. Primeiramente,  mostrámos que a TDP1  se mantém no BES ativo  mesmo após o 
silenciamento do BES ter sido despoletado . Ao induzirmos o silenciamento do BES ativo  
após a  depleção da TDP1 , verificámos que  a cromatina  do BES ativo  ficou mais 
compactada  indic ando que a TDP1 é um factor chave na estabilização da conformação de 
cromatina aberta aquando de alterações  do status  transcricional do BES ativo . Mostrámos 
ainda que durante uma mudança in situ , os parasitas sondam mais que um BES  silenciado 
ao mesmo temp o, inclusivamente expressando outros VSGs. Determinámos que , após 24 
horas de silenciamento do BES, aproximadamente metade das células  já estavam  
molecularmente  comprometidas para mudar a transcrição para outro BES, enquanto que 
as restantes  células  podiam  reverter e re-transcrever o BES inicial. Curiosamente, as 
células que, às 24 horas após o silenciamento do BES  ativo , não estivessem  
especificamente  a sondar um  determinado  BES (e o seu VSG) não mudavam  a transcrição  
para esse BES  e consequentemente para a expressão do VSG desse BES . Globalmente, 
estes resultados levaram -nos a propôr um modelo em que durante  a indução de  uma 
mudança in situ , a transcrição do BES ativo  é suspensa mas a cromatina é mantida numa 
conformação aberta pela TDP1. Isto permite aos parasitas sondar BES silenciados  e avaliar 
a funcionalidade das proteínas expressas nesses BES  para decidir se muda de BES  e de 
VSG expresso à superfície da célula  ou se voltam a  transcrever o BES inicial  mantendo a 
expressão do mesmo VSG . Considerando est a linha celular, a re -transcrição do BES inicial 
que está bloqueado com o sistema indutível de tetraciclina leva à morte dos parasitas.  
A importância da TDP1 na transcrição da Pol I e no processo de mudança  de VSG  
levou -nos a perguntar se o ganho de função  da TDP1 , através do aumento do conteúdo 
celular desta proteína,  poderia interferir com a expressão monoalélica. Utilizando uma 
linha celular que permite sobre -expressar a TDP1, observámos que a cromatina do 
genoma fica globalmente mais aberta (a diferente s níveis  consoante as regiões 
genómicas ) exceptuando o BES ativo  e os genes ribossomais , sugerindo que estas duas 
regiões possuem a cromatina completamente aberta. Adicionalmente, os nivéis de 
transcritos de RNA mensageiro apenas aumentaram para os BES sil enciados, MES 
(Metacyclic Expression Sites , que contém genes de VSGs que apenas são expressos 
quando os parasitas se encontram nas glândulas salivares da tsé -tse prontos a serem 
injectados no hospedeiro mamífero ) e regiões de prociclínas confirmando o pape l da VIII 
 TDP1 como um facilitador de transcrição de Pol I [14]. Também observámos  a expressão 
de um VSG silen ciado  para além do VSG ativo  após a sobre -expressão da TDP1, 
confirmando a disrupção da expressão monoalélica.  
Globalmente, esta dissertação esclarece a relevância da cromatina durante uma 
mudança in situ  e elucida os papéis da TDP1 como um fator chave para a variação 
antigénica.

 AFRICAN TRYPANOSOMIASIS  
African trypanosomiasis  (AT) is an endemic disease in the sub -Saharan Africa [15]. 
This disease is caused by a protozoan parasite from the Trypanosoma  genus, which is 
transmitted by the tsetse, a fly from the genus Glossina . Thus, the distribution of AT is 
correlated with the distribution of the tsetse in Africa. Depending on the mammalian 
host, there are two different forms of the disease: the Animal and the Human African 
trypanosomiasis (AAT and HAT, respectively).  
AAT, also known as n’gana, is specificall y caused by T. congolense , T.vivax  and T. b. 
brucei . AAT affects both wild and domestic animals although in the former the infection 
symptoms are mild  whereas in the latter,  the infection often causes death [16]. As a 
consequence, AAT causes a severe economic burden. According to the Food and 
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, losses are estimated to be in the range of 
US$ 1 -1.2 billion in cattle  alone.  
HAT, or sleeping sickness, is caused by two subspecies of T. brucei , T. b. gambiense  
and T. b. rho desiense  [3, 15]. Rarely, some human infections were repor ted to be caused 
by animal infective trypanosome species [17]. T. b. gambiense  infections occur in the 
Central and Western Africa, giving rise to a chronic form of HAT. It accounts for ~98% of 
all HAT reported cases leading to death in 3 to 4 years if untreated. On the other hand, T. 
b. rhodesiense  infections occur in the Eastern Af rica, giving rise to an acute and rapidly 
progressing form of HAT. Thus, it accounts for ~2% of HAT cases causing death in 6 
months if left untreated. In 2014, according to the  WHO  (World Health Organization ), the 
number of HAT new reported cases was 3796,  the estimated number of cases below 
15000 but the estimated population at risk is still around 70 million people [1]. 
HAT progresses in  two stages: an early stage or haemolymphatic phase, 
characterized by the presence of the parasites in the bloodstream and lymphatic system 
and a late stage or neurological phase where the parasites are able to cross the blood -
brain barrier invading the ce ntral nervous system. Both forms of HAT present similar signs 
and symptoms of the disease , although with  different  severity and frequency, being the 
rhodesiense  form of the disease more acute and with shorter time -lapse of the early stage  
[3, 16]. For the early stage , the symptoms  account as  headache , physical weakness , 4 
 intermittent fever, dermatologic problems, anemia,  musculoskeletal pains,  
lymphadenopathies , cardiac disorders, endocrine disturbances and hepatosplenomegaly. 
The late stage infected patients present a disturbed sleep -wake cycle and  
neuropsychiatric symptoms such as confusion, sensory disturbances, extreme lethargy, 
poor condition and coma. Importantly, the 24 hour circadian rhythm is disrupted and 
alterations in the circadian fluctuations of cortisol, prolactin, and growth hormone 
secretion, as well as of plasma renin activity  were already detected in patients  [18, 19]. 
Nowadays the diagnosis of HAT is performed according to a decision tree [20]. 
Initially, a serological test for antibody detection is performed proceeding afterwards to 
lymph node examination and further analytical techniques. If the exams turn to be 
positive, a stage diagno sis is performed by a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lumbar punction to 
further decide the treatment. In the absence of trypanosomes in the CSF, it is considered 
that the patient is in the early stage of the disease and pentamidine (for T. b.  gambiense ) 
and su ramin (for T. b. rhod esiense ) are the drugs given to the patients. Although with 
slight undesirable effects, these drugs are well -tolerated by the patients. On the contrary, 
if trypanosomes are detected in the CSF, it means that the patients are already in  the late 
stage of HAT. In this case, the drugs administered to the patients are: melarsoprol, which 
is used for both T. b.  gambiense  and rhod esiense  infections but elicits several side -effects 
that can be fatal; eflornithine, which is less toxic but only effective against T. b. 
gambiense ; and a combination eflornithine/nifurtimox in which nifurtimox increases the 
efficacy  of eflornithine as a first line defense for T. b. gambiense  but not tested for T. b. 
rhod esiense  yet.

 TRYPANOSOMA BRUCEI  BIOLOGY ASPECTS  
Trypanosoma brucei  is a unicellular eukaryote that taxonomically is placed in the  
supergroup Excavata, phylum Euglenozoa, class Kinetoplastida. Kinetoplastids diverged 
very early in the eukaryotic lineage of evolution [21], such that Euglenozoa has been 
considered to belong to the root of the eukaryotic tree of evolution [22]. Although 
trypanosomes branched from higher eukaryotes possessing unique features, T. brucei  is 
often used as a model organism since it  is easy to cultivate in vitro  and its genome is 
sequenced [23], making it easy to manipulate. It is also striking how this model organism 
became a platform for the discovery of several important aspec ts and pathways that are 
common within eukaryotic cells. Amongst them, the presence of 
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors [24], a post -translational modification in the C -
terminus of proteins that allows attachment of proteins on the e xtracellular moiety of the 
plasma membrane; RNA editing [25], a process by which an RNA transcript can be 
subjected to sequence nucleotide changes, either by insertion, deletion or replacement; 
trans -splicing [26-28], a process by which two or more different RNA transcripts are 
joined or spliced into a single messenger RNA (mRNA). Moreover, and specifically 
concerning kinetoplastids, it was on T. brucei  that the DNA base J  (-D-
glucopyranosyloxymethylurac il) [29, 30], and the glycolytic specialized organelle 
glycosome [31, 32] were first found.  
 
Life cycle of T. brucei  
 The life cycle of T. brucei  oscillates between two hosts: the mammal and the 
transmitting vector tsetse (Figure 1). When the tsetse bites the mammalian host, it 
uptakes blood as a meal but also releases parasites in the growth -arrested metacyclic 
form [33] through its salivary glands. These parasites, when in the bloodstream of the 
host, re -acquire cell division through binary fission and adopt a morphological long 
slender form (LSF), being commonly termed  bloodstream forms (BSF s). BSFs are able to 
establish an infection by evading the host immune system through antigenic variation of 
the cell surface variant surface glycoproteins (VSG) (see section 1.5). The dense VSG coat 
also serves as a physical p rotection since it avoids lysis from the alternative pathway of 6 
 complement activation [34]. The changes between metacyclics and BSFs are also 
accompanied by a change of the VSG coat from the metacyclic subset (mVSGs) to the 
bloodstream subset of VSGs, which takes around 5 -6 days [35]. Throughout the infection, 
trypanosomes also invade other body fluids (lymphatic system and spinal fluid) and 
tissues with a high focus in the adipose tissue [2] and dermis [36]. A recent study from our 
group also showed that parasites adapt their metabolism when  living in the adipose 
tissue, including activation of the -oxidation pathway in T. brucei  [2]. Ultimately, the 
parasites progress to the central nervo us system, causing the neurological disorders.  
 
Figure 1 – Representation of the life cycle of Trypanosoma brucei  and its different forms on 
both mammal and tsetse hosts.  Injection of metacyclic forms during a tsetse meal is followed by 
proliferation of long slender  or bloodstream  forms ( BSFs) in the bloodstream and lymphatic 
system and accumulate at high density in the adipose tissue (ATFs) later in infection. At high 
density, BSFs differentiate to short stumpy forms (SSs) wh ich are uptaken by the tsetse. In the 
adipose tissue both BSFs (in purple) and SSs (in dark grey) co -exist. SSs differentiate in procyclic 
forms (PFs) in the tsetse midgut, which will migrate to the proventriculus an d assymetrically 
divide in a long and a short epimastigote. The short epimastigote migrates and attaches to the 
epithelia of the salivary glands to finally differentiate in to metacyclic forms which are competent 
to infect a new mammalian host upon a new tsetse meal (image adapted from [2, 37]). 
 
7 
 Proliferation of the parasites in the bloodstream leads to the accumulation of a 
mysterious stumpy induction factor (SIF) that drives the differentiation of BSFs to another 
life cycle stage in the bl oodstream , the short stumpy forms (SS s), at high parasiteamia 
levels [38, 39]. The response to SIF is density -dependent similar to quorum sensing 
mechanism and involves an extensive cascade of factors that ultimately control cell -cycle 
and gene expression [40]. SSs are mainly characterized by a small sized morphology, 
expression of PAD1 ( Protein Associated with Differentiation 1, a carboxylate transporter) 
and a G0/G1 cell-cycle arrest [39, 41, 42], which prepares them to be uptaken by the 
tsetse during a blood meal. The transcriptome [43-45] and the proteome [46] of SS 
becomes altered in relation to BSFs, namely its metabolism is prepared fo r living in the 
tsetse midgut environment. Furthermore, these are the only forms that can survive after 
transmission back to the tsetse [47]. 
Upon entry in the tsetse midgut, the parasites start di fferentiating to procyclic 
forms (PFs) and start a process of development in the tsetse that lasts 20 -30 days  [3]. The 
drop of temperature  and the sensing of citrate in the fly midgut are the cues for this 
differentiation  [48], which is initiated by a Nek -related kinase defining a com mitment step 
[49]. One study performed a transcript analysis throughout the process of differentiation 
from pure SSs to PFs [44], whereas another study [50] conducted an experiment starting 
differentiation with pleomorphic BSFs. Some similarities were obtained but the latter 
study suffered a 12 -hour delay as a transition to “stumpy -like” forms before committing 
for procyclics while the former study started with pure SS. Other studies observed the 
steady -state differences of the transcriptome [43, 45] and proteome [46] in SSs and PFs, 
but the majority of the works has focused on observing changes between BSF and PF (for 
transcriptome [43-45, 50-53], for proteome [46, 54, 55]). Another major change that 
takes place during differentiation to procyclics is the replacement of the cell surface coat 
from VSG to procyc lins, which is a consequence of adaptation to a new host. As such, the 
C-terminal domain of highly acidic procyclins allows protection against digestive enzymes 
from the tsetse midgut [56]. In a single cell, the 107 VSG molecules are shed from the 
surface by MSP -B (Major Surface Protease B, a zinc metalloprotease) and GPI -PLC 
(Glycophosphatidylinositol Phospholipase C) [57, 58] in the first 18 hours [44]. At the 
same time, two classes of procyclins, EP (for Glu -Pro repeats) and GPEET (for Gly -Pro-Glu-8 
 Glu-Thr repeats), become expressed within 6  hours [44, 59]. After 7 days, only EP 
procyclins  are expressed at the cell surface of procyclics [60]. 
Upon this stage, procyclics migrate to the tsetse proventriculus, where they give 
rise to a long epimastigote and ultimately divide assimetrically into a long and a short 
epimastigote [61].  At this stage, epimastigotes express another surfac e protein termed 
BARP (for brucei  alanine -rich protein) [62]. Unlike the long epimastigotes that eventually 
die, the short epimasti gotes migrate to the salivary glands attaching to the epithelial cells. 
There, sexual exchange may undergo between epimastigotes [63, 64], before 
differentiating to metacyclic forms, where binary fission stops and acquisition of a new 
mVSG coat occurs [65]. In the last step, metacyclics detach from the epithelial cells and 
are ready to infect a new mammalian host.  
Several transitions of T. brucei  life cycle can be mimicked in vitro . Differentiation 
from BSFs to PFs is accomplishable by reducing the temperature from 37ºC to 27ºC and 
addition of citrate/ cis-aconitate to the medium [48, 66]. However, performing this in 
monomorphic cell -lines bypasses the formation of stumpy forms probably due to stable 
maintenance in laboratory conditions that leads to a failure in the signaling pathway [67]. 
Nonetheless, addition of  a cAMP derivative  termed  8-(4-chlorophenylthio) -cAMP 
(pCPTcAMP) allows  slender -to-“stumpy -like”  differentiation in monomorphs  [67]. The 
inability to naturally differentiate to stumpy forms is the reason why monomorph ic 
strains  are more virulent in mice than pleomorphic strains [68].  
Until recently, only these two transitions could be performed in vitro . Kolev and 
collegues recapitulated the transitions procyclic -to-epimastigote -to-metacyclic by 
overexpressing the RNA -binding protein RBP6 in PFs [69], where individual metacyclics 
express a single mVSG at the cell surface [70]. 
 
Genome organization of T. brucei  
 The nucleus of T. brucei  has a diameter size of ~2.5 m [71] and possesses a very 
unusual set of chromosomes divided into three different classes: 11 diploid megabase 
chromoso mes that vary in size (0.9 to 5.7 Mbp) 1 -5 intermediate chromosomes (200 to 9 
 900 kbp) and ~100 minichromosomes (30 to 150 kbp) [23, 72, 73]. Field isolates, but not 
laboratory strains, contain extrachromosomal DNA sequences termed NlaIII repeat (NR) -
elements, which may derive from subtelomeric recombinational events, that can last for 
several generations [74]. 
 The megab ase chromosomes encompass the housekeeping genes, including all 
RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and RNA polymerase III (Pol III) transcribed genes, which are 
organized in several polycistronic transcription units (PTU) [75], similar to operons in 
bacteria. The subtelomeric regions of the megabase chromosomes are also the home of 
the Bloodstream and Metacyclic Expression Sites  (BES and MES, respectively) (these loci 
will be discussed ahead). Intermediate chromosomes are composed of non -repetitive 
DNA, repetitive sequences of 177 -bp satellite sequences and functional BES together with 
telomeric repeats [76], and it is possible that these chromosomes have der ived from 
subtelomeric breakage of megabase chromosomes [77]. As for minichromosomes, they 
comprise around 10% of nuclear DNA [73], and are composed of long 177 -bp satellite 
sequences which have an inversion point in the center of the minichromosome, plus 70 -
bp repeats followed by VSG genes (the only g enes in minichromosomes) and the 
telomeric repeats [78, 79]. 
 Trypanosoma brucei also possess another type of DNA which is not present in the 
nucleus: the kinetoplast. The kinetoplast is composed of a huge network mesh of 
maxicircles (analogous t o mitochondrial DNA) and minicircles [80]. There are between 50 -
100 maxicircles with a size of around 23 kb and 5.000 -10.000 minicircles of around 1 kb in 
a network [81, 82]. The maxicircles encode for 9S and 12S mitochondrial  ribosomal RNAs 
and mitochondrial membrane proteins [83-85], which are subjected to RNA editing, while 
the minicircles give rise to guide RNAs for RNA editing [86, 87]. 
 
The special organization of VSG genes and Expression Sites  
 The genome of the best sequenced T. brucei  strain (TREU927) contains a round 
2000 VSG genes, distributed amongst VSG arrays localized in the internal parts of 
megabase chromosomes, in BESs and MESs of megabase and intermediate (in this case, 10 
 only BES are present) chromosomes and as single genes in minichromosomes (Figure 2) 
[23, 88, 89].  
 
Figure 2 - Organization of VSG genes in the genome of Trypanosoma brucei . (a) Example of an 
internal array nearby housekeeping genes (in blue) containing functional VSG genes (in red) and 
pseudogenes (in grey) and an  ingi-like retrotransposon element (in light blue). (b) Typical 
representation of a bloodstream expression site (BES). Upstream of the promoter (white flag) are 
located the 50 bp -repeats, while downstream  of the promoter are located the expression -site 
associated genes (ESAGs, in blue), possible pseudo -ESAGs ( in grey), 70 bp -repeats and the VSG 
gene (in red) before the telomeric repeats. (c) Typical representation of a metacyclic expression 
site (MES). This monocistronic locus only contains the promoter (white flag) and the VSG gene (in 
red) and occasionally de generate 70 bp -repeats in between (small stripped box). Upstream the 
promoter ESAGs (in blue) , pseudo -ESAGs (in grey) or retrotransposons (light blue ) can also be 
present . (d) Representation of a minichromosome. This genomic class is composed of 177 bp -
repeats, 70 bp -repeats (vertical stripped boxes) and VSGs (in red) upstream the telomeric repeats. 
(Imagen taken from [90]). 
 
The number of annotated VSGs has increase d in the last years from 806 [23] 
(although these count only the VSG arrays genes) to 2563 genes [91], which may be 
expla ined by different analyzed strains, better technology for assembly and analysis and 
the type of chromosomes that were targeted in the studies. In the latter study, the 
VSGnome of the common laboratory Lister 427 strain was analyzed and showed 
interesting f eatures about the VSG repertoire: of the 2563 VSG genes, only 325 (13%) are 
11 
 fully functional while the remaining exist as incomplete genes or pseudogenes; 360 genes 
exist with two or more copies; nucleotide and protein sequences of Lister 427 VSGs are 
very  dissimilar from those in TREU927 strain (less than 50%); although the nearly 100 
minichromosomes have potential for 200 VSG genes, only 65 minichromosome associated 
VSG were identified meaning that not all minichromosomes contain VSGs. Also, this study 
identified six mVSG genes although in T. b. rhodesiense  a set of 29 mVSG proteins has 
previously been detected [92].  
VSG genes can only be transcribed from sp ecialized loci, the BES in bloodstream 
forms or MES in metacyclic forms (Figure 2). In the genome of Lister 427 there are 15 
BESs that are distributed in the subtelomeric regions of megabase and intermediate 
chromosomes [93]. BESs have ~45 -60 kb in length and its structure is the following: a 50 
bp-repeat sequence, a Pol I promoter, a variable number of expression site -associated 
genes (ESA Gs) intercalated in some cases with pseudo -ESAGs, a 70 bp -repeat sequence, a 
VSG gene and the telomeric repeats (Figure 2) [93]. There are 12 ESAGs termed ESAG1 -12 
(Table 1), although each BES possesses a different combination of ESAGs, which may even 
include either absence or duplication of an ESAG according to the BES  [93]. The 
expression of a specific BES with a specific combination of ESAGs may be related to the 
adaptation to  different mammalian hosts [94]. It is noteworthy that BES8 is the only BES 
that could no t be activated in vitro , having the particularity that contains a single ESAG7 
besides its VSG [93]. 
T. b. rho desiense  has a special ESAG, the serum resistance -associated gene (SRA), 
which confers resistanc e to the human serum [95]. SRA is derived from  a VSG [96] and 
can bind with high affinity to the trypanolytic factor apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) inside the 
cell. SRA avoids the insertion of APOL1 in the plasma membrane for pore formation and 
cell death, and instead leads AP OL1 for degradation as a mechanism of resistance in 
humans [97]. 
 On the other hand, MES are also subtelomeric regions in the megabase 
chromosome and, structurally, are one of two  examples, together with splice leader (SL) 
genes, of monocistronic transcription in T. brucei  [98]. MES possess a small size between 
~1-5 kb and the structure of a MES involves a promot er, highly degenerate 70 -bp repeats 12 
 and a mVSG (Figure 2) [98, 99]. In some cases, a partial ESAG or a VSG pseudogene may 
be present upstream of the promoter [91, 100].

 GENERA L TRANSCRIPTION IN  TRYPANOSOMA BRUCEI  
 Transcription in T. brucei  is highly unusual as almost all genes are organized in 
polycistronic rather than monocistronic transcription units [23, 75]. There are around 150 
PTUs bearing the housekeeping genes [109, 110], but  with no apparent functional 
relation between the genes present in each PTU [111]. The regions between each PTU are 
named strand switch regions (SSR) which can transcriptionally  be convergent or 
divergent. However, promoters for Pol II transcription have not been identified in T. 
brucei  with the  sole exception of the promoter that transcribed the splice leader genes 
[112, 113]. Strikingly, th e great majority of the genes in  T. brucei do not contain introns 
except for two genes: Poly(A) polymerase and an ATP -dependent DEAD/H RNA helicase 
[23, 114]. Unlike Pol I transcription (which will be approached in section 1.4), Pol II and 
Pol III transcription is constitutive. Thus, regulation of mRNA abundance is dependent of 
post -transcriptional mechanisms such as trans -splicing, polyadenylation and mRNA 
stability (albeit th ese processes are common to Pol I -transcribed PTUs), which will be 
further discussed. Other processes like mRNA export and translation control are  also 
crucial for gene expression in trypanosomes [115-117]. However, these regulatory steps 
will not be further described as they fall beyond the scope of this dissertation.  
 
RNA Polymerase II and III transcription  
 Pol II  in T. brucei  is composed of twelve subunits, termed RPB1 -12 [118, 119]. 
Interestingly, these parasites contain two paralogues of RPB5  (RPB5 and RPB5z), RPB6 
(RPB6 and RPB6z) and RPB10 (RPB10 and RPB10 z), but only the non -z isoforms are 
associated to Pol II [120]. Discovery of Pol II promoters has remained elusive (except for 
SL genes) although the structural and spatial organization of putative bidirectional 
promoter has already been proposed [121]. Rather, probable transcription start sites 
(TSS) have been associated to a number of epigenetic marks: acetylated  H4K10 
(H4K10ac), H2A.Z, H2B.V, tri -methylated H3K4  (H3K4me3) histones  and the 
bromodomain factor 3 (BDF3)  are enriched at probable Pol II TSS [109, 122]. It is 
proposed that the presence of these histones in the nucleosomes of TSS make them 
unstable to facilitate nucleosome eviction prior to transcription [109]. At the end of the 14 
 PTUs, the transcription termination sites (TTS) are also enriched in specific epigenetic 
marks: H3V and H4V  histone variants [109]. Loss of H3V leads to the production of small 
interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in reg ions of overlapping transcription at convergent strand 
switch regions [123]. Additionally, flanking regions of Pol II PTUs are enriched in base J 
[124]. Base J or -D-glucopyranosyloxymethyluracil is a hypermodified DNA base which is 
only present in kinetoplastids which is g enerated in a two steps by thymidine 
hydroxylases JBP1 and JBP2 (first step) and a glucosyltransferase (second step) [125-127]. 
In Leishmania , loss of base J leads  to transcriptional readthrough at TTSs with a dramatic 
effect in cell survival [128]. On the other hand,  base J depletion in T. brucei  does not have 
a readthrough effect at the TTSs but rather allows transcription of downstream genes 
within some specific PTUs, i.e. base J attenuates Pol II transcription in the middle of 
specific PTUs [129]. This effect was also observed upon depletion of H3V [123]. 
 Being the only Pol II known promoter, SL gene promoter has been used to unveil 
the transcription factors behind Pol II transcription : TFIIB is essential and required for the 
association of Pol II to the preinitiation complex [130]; TATA -binding protein related 
factor 4 ( TRF4) is also essential,  being  recruited to the gene promoter [131] and tightly 
associated with the tSNAP complex [132, 133]; and  TFIIH is a basal transcription factor 
that works in transcription initiation and elongation [134, 135]. 
 Pol III transcribes the 5S ribosomal DNA (rDNA), transfer RNAs (tRNAs ), and a 
subset of U -rich small nuclear RNAs, which are dispersed throughout the megabase 
chromosomes [136-140]. Pol III is typically composed of seventeen subunits although 
several subunits are common to either Pol I or Pol II [141]. Only one transcription factor 
for Pol III transcription has been identified, the TFIIIB subunit BRF1 [133], although the 
structure of the tRNA gene promoters contains elements which allow the binding of TFIIIB 
and TFIIIC [142]. 
 
Determinants of mRNA levels  
The generation of mature mRNAs from the polycistronic mRNA occurs through 
coupled  trans -splicing and polyadenylation [143]. This coupled mechanism happens  co-
transcriptionally a few minutes after synthesis of the splicing acceptor site [144]. Within a 15 
 polycistronic mRNA, an  upstream gene is polyadenylated at the 3’ untranslated region 
(3’UTR) while a downstream gene is trans -spliced at the 5’ untranslated region (5’UTR). 
Trans -splicing is a two -step transesterification reaction in which a 39 -nucleotide sequence 
from the ~140 -nucleotide SL RNA is capped, highly modified, and added to the 5’UTR of 
the mRNA [145, 146]. Contrary to cis-splicing, this process involves the formation of an 
intermediate Y structure instead of a lariat structure [27]. Both types of splicing possess 
the same motif requirements , a polypyrimidine  [poly(Y)]  tract, a GT dinucleotide at the 5 ’ 
splice site, an AG dinucleotide at the 3 ’ splice acceptor site and, eventually , exonic 
enhancer motifs  [147-149]. Polyadenylation occurs by the addition of a chain of 
adenosine monophosphates to the 3’UTR by a complex that contains the Poly(A) 
polymerase [150]. The poly(Y) tract is also important for the polyadenylation signaling 
[151]. More than 32000 unique splice -acceptor sites have been identified for ~8900  genes 
and more than 50000 polyadenylation sites were identified for ~8000 genes [152], 
showing that some genes contain alternative splice -acceptor and polyadenylation sites.  
The stability and degradation of th e mRNAs (together with gene copy number) are 
key features to establish mRNA abundance and variability. As previously mentioned, the 
T. brucei  transcriptome changes between the different life -cycle stages [43-45, 50-53]. 
Moreover, each BSF cell is calculated to contain 20000 mRNA molecules while each PF cell 
contains twice as much mRNA molecules [153]. In T. brucei , stability of mRNA  depend s on 
the presence of regulatory sequences in the 3’UTR and the binding of specific RNA -
binding proteins.  The importance of the  3’UTR  in gene expression control was initially 
established when the 3’UTR  of the  procyclin,  THT-1 transporter , aldolase, 
phosphogl ycerate B and C mRNAs were found to be developmentally regulated [154, 
155]. In procyclin mRNAs, a 16 -mer stem -loop and a 26 -mer poly(Y) sequences in the 
3’UTR were unveiled as elements that are important for mRNA stability in PFs and 
degradation in BSFs  [156]. RNA -binding proteins are also important for the stabilization of 
specific mRNAs and life -cycle progression [157]. As example s, knock -down of RBP10 leads 
to down -regulation of several enriched mRNAs in BSFs and its overexpression in PFs leads 
to accumulation of those mRNAs [158], knock -down of ALBA3/4 in procyclic forms leads 
to cell-cycle arrest together with nucleus repositioning  [159] and overexpression of RBP6 
in procyclics promotes developmental transitions until metacyclic forms [69].  16 
 The steady -state levels of an mRNA also depend on its rate of degradation. 
Usually, the degradation starts with the deadenylation by the CAF1 -NOT and P AN2/PAN3 
complexes [116, 160], followed by decapping and, ultimately, 5’ -> 3’ degradation by 
XRNA and 3’ -> 5’ degradation by the exosome [161, 162]. For mRNAs with very short half -
life, a direct decapping and rapid degradation by XRNA can occur, bypassing the 
deadenylation step [161]. 
 These post -transcriptional mechanism s also occur in Pol I transcripts, although, 
regulation at the transcriptional level is probably more important as it will be explained 
below.  
  17 
 RNA POLYMERASE I TRANSCRIPTION  
 In almost all eukaryotic cells, Pol I solely transcribes rDNA genes which accounts 
for ~60% of all synthesized RNA [163], the rate of ribosome biosynthesis being 
proportional to the growth rate and proliferation [164]. rDNA transcription occurs in the 
nucleolus where 200 repeats (in yeast) or 300 -400 (in humans) rDNA tra nscription units 
encode for three major rRNA species: 18S, 5.8S and 25S (28S in humans).  A full 35S or 47S 
pre-rRNA precursor is synthesized, processed into the 3 rRNA species and, together with 
Pol III -synthesized 5S rRNA and Pol II -transcribed ribosomal proteins, are assembled in 
ribosomes and exported from the nucleus [165]. Besides the rDNA genes, the rDNA 
repeats also contain an intergenic spacer, possessing different lengths according to the 
species, that can harbor some genetic elements such as enhancers or termination si tes 
[166]. 
 In T. brucei , Pol I also synthesizes a 45S pre -rRNA  which is processed into the  18S 
and 5 .8S but the large subunit is processed into two large (LSUa and LSUb) and four small 
(sr1, 2, 4 and 6) RNA molecules [167]. However, this parasite possesses a highly reduced 
number of rRNA repeats: only 9 repeats which are divided amongst 4 different 
chromosomes [140]. Strikingly, African trypanosomes are the only known organisms in 
which Pol I machi nery transcribe s protein coding genes, specifically the genes present in 
procyclin, MES and BES loci [4]. Although not scientifically proven, this surprising fact may 
be a consequence of two factors: Pol I is known to be the fast -acting polymerase amongst 
the canonical polymerases allow ing high transcription rate of surface protein mRNAs and 
the lack of Pol II transcriptional regulation may require another polymerase machinery to 
circumvent the life -cycle dependent necessities for different surface proteins.  
 
RNA polymerase I machinery and transcription cycle in yeast and humans  
 Saccharomyces cerevisiae  Pol I machinery is composed of fourteen subunits  
(Table 2), of which five are shared with Pol II and Pol III, two are shared only with Pol III 
and the remaining seven are specific of th is complex [168].  18

 The transcription cycle is the sequence of events that start with the assembly of 
the pre -initiation compl ex (PIC) at the promoter until the termination step that releases 
the transcript and the polymerase. Transcription initiation with the formation of PIC in 
yeast is dependent of four factors: Rrn3, core factor, TATA -binding protein (TBP) and 
upstream activa ting factor (UAF). Rrn3 binds to RPA43 subunit to allow bridging between 
the polymerase and the core factor in the rDNA promoter [170]. The core factor is a three 
subunit complex essential for transcription that enhances polymerase binding to the 
promoter and positioning in  the transcription start site [171, 172]. UAF is a six subunit 
complex in which Uaf30 subunit provides efficient binding to the rDNA promoter allowing 
activation of the rDNA genes [173, 174]. TBP, although not required for basal 
transcription [172], promotes full activation of transcription by binding to UAF and 19 
 helping to recruit the core factor [175]. Transcription elongation requires subcomplex 
RPA49 and RPA34.5 to promoter elongation [176] as well as topoisomerases I and II to 
remove the accumulation of negative (in the wake of polymerase) and positive (ahead of 
the polymerase) supercoiling  [177, 178]. Moreover, Spt4/5 heterodimer is considered to 
be a negative  regulator of elongation [179], while Paf1 complex increases the rate of 
elongation of Pol I [180]. To terminate the transcription, 10 -15 bp T -rich sequence 
together with proteins Reb1 and Nsf1 are important to pause Pol I transcription and 
release the transcript [181, 182]. 
 The human Pol I complex is very similar to the yeast complex as homologues of all 
subunits except of RPA14 have been identified [169] (Table 2). Formation of the PIC in 
humans is dependent of Rrn3, selectivity facto r 1 (SL1, homologue of the core factor) and 
upstream binding factor (UBF). Human Rrn3 fulfills the same function as in yeast bridging 
the polymerase to SL1 [183]. SL1 is composed of TBP and at least three TBP -associated 
proteins and also mediates recruitme nt of Pol I which has no sequence -specific DNA 
binding activity [184]. UBF is not f unctionally related to UAF since it is a high mobility 
group box (HMGB) protein and is required to activate transcription through the 
interaction of its acidic C terminus with SL1 [184, 185]. The role of UBF as a HMGB and its 
importance for Pol I transcription will be discussed ahead. Human Pol I transcription 
activation is promoted by hPAF53/CAST heterodimer which is the ortholog of RPA49 and 
RPA34.5 subcomplex [186] and elongation is regulated by the phosphorylation of HMG 
boxes of UBF [187]. Transcription termination also depends of a T -rich stretch upstream 
of a 11 bp Sal box [188]. This Sal box allows the binding of TTF -I to promote transcription 
pausing. In mice, the factor PTRF binds to Pol I and TTF -I to allow release of the 
polymerase and transcript from the DNA template [189]. 
 
Epigenetic control of rDNA  genes in yeast and humans  
Although yeast and mammalian nucleoli contain hundreds of rDNA repeats, only 
~50% are transcriptionally active [190, 191]. Ribosomal RNA genes are  organized into 
Nucleolus Organizer Regions (NORs) which can exist between amongst active and inactive 
states, which show very distinct chromatin structures. Initial studies using psoralen -20 
 crosslinking showed that two chromatin conformations co -exist in th e nucleoli [192]: one 
is nucleosome -enriched, i.e. closed chromatin, and corresponds to inactive repeats 
whereas the other contain much less nucleosome content in the gene body, i.e. open 
chromatin, and corresponds to the active repeats. However, it has been reported  that 
even rDNA active repeats contain histones in a dynamic chromatin structure subjected to 
remodeling [193]. More recently, a third chromatin structure in rDNA genes was 
identified in mammalian cells. It consists in a poised chromatin structure prone to 
transcriptional activation and it is characterized by an unmethyl ated promoter associated 
with PIC components but not Pol I, together with a bivalent histone modification in 
nucleosome specifically localized in a transcriptional repressive position [194]. Several 
epigenetic regulators control the establishment and maintenance of the different 
chromatin states through cell -cycle progression, which range from DNA methylation 
proteins, histone modifying enzymes, chromatin remodelers and non -coding RNAs.  
In mammalian cells, active rDNA repeats are enriched in UBF, nucleolin, DNA 
hypomethylation and also contain histone modifications such as H3K4me3 and 
acetylation of histones H3 and H4 [195] (Figure 3). Activation of rDNA repeats is highly 
dependent of the transcription termination factor TTF -I. This factor is able to bind the 
termination sequence T 0 localized just upstream the TSS and also the termination 
sequence T 1-10 localized downstream the transcription unit. TTF -I can oligomerize and  
bridge a DNA loop between T 0 and T 1-10 to spatially create a chromatin hub of high 
transcriptional activity [196]. Also, TTF -I recruits the Cockayne Syndrome protein B (CSB) 
to promote Pol I transcription elongation [197]. CSB is also resp onsible for the 
recruitment of the histone H4 and H3K9 acetyltransferase PCAF to poised rDNA genes to 
promote association of Pol I to the promoters and , consequently , initiation of rDNA 
transcription [198].  
Mammalian inactive or silent rDNA repeats contain several epigenetic marks such 
as trimethylation of H3K9, H4K20 and H3K27, histone H4  deacetylation  or CpG 
methylation in the promote r or enhancer [199-202] (Figure 3). Here, TTF -I is also 
considered a key regulator to repress rDNA genes. TTF -I can interact with the large 
subunit of the Nucleolar Remodeling Complex (NoRC) TIP5 (for TTF -I interacting protein 
5), leading to the recruit ment of  DNA methyltransferases, histone methyltransferase and 21 
 deacetylation enzymes and repositioning of the promoter -proximal nucleosome further 
downstream to the TSS blocking pre -RNA synthesis [200, 203, 204]. In this context, non -
coding RNAs also play important role s in rDNA chromatin establishment. A promoter -
associated RNA (pRNA) derived from a Pol I promoter ~2kb upstream of the rDNA TSS is 
crucial to bind TIP5 after NoRC repositioned the promoter -proximal nucleosome [205, 
206]. The pRNA is able to recruit DNMT3b and methylate CpG residue at position -133 
inhibiting UBF binding and PIC formation, together with histone deacetylases and 
methyltransferases [204, 207, 208]. CpG methylation is also important for rDNA silencing 
as inactivation of  DNA methyltransferases DNMT1 and DNMT3b or  inhibition by 5 -aza-2’-
deoxycytidine leads to the opening of silent repeats and even cryptic transcription by RNA 
Pol II [209, 210].  
 
Figure 3 – Structural organization of rDNA  repeats in mammalian cells.  RNA polymerase I 
actively transcribed repeats (ON) possess a chromatin enriched in UBF and nucleolin (NCL). 
Histone modifications occur in histones along the gene body. Silenced repeats (OFF) have a very 
compact chromatin with several histone methylation marks. The nucleolar remodeling complex 
(NoRC) recru its DNA methyltransferases (DNMT), histone methyltransferase (HMT) and 
deacetylation (HDAC) enzymes to establish a heterochromatin status and block transcription. In 
both status, TTF -I is important to recruit factors that promote both transcription and 
heterochromatin establishment. (Image adapted from [211]) 
 
In conditions of cell growth arrest, a poised chromatin establishment occurs and is 
dependent of the NuRD (nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation) complex [212]. This 
22 
 complex is recruited by TTF -I and CSB to unmethylated promoters in order to form a 
repressive nucleosome in the core promoters which as the bivalent histone mark 
H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 [194]. Moreover, NuRD can negatively regulate TIP5 avoiding 
the CpG methylation  at the promoter [213]. When mammalian cells enter a star vation 
state, the rDNA chromatin is silenced by eNoSC (for energy -dependent nucleolar silencing 
complex) in an unstable and reversible manner to conserve energy until suitable 
energetic conditions occur again [214]. eNoSC  binds to rDNA promoters to deacetylate 
and methylate histone H3 causing the establishment of heterochromatin through the 
rDNA loci [215]. 
In yeast, it was sho wn that a strain with only 42 rDNA repeats in the genome did 
not significantly change the rate of rRNA biosynthesis since  the loading of Pol I in the 
promoter and transcription initiation becomes  increased [216]. Thus, it is not the number 
of active rDNA repeats that determines transcription rate. Ribosomal RNA silencing in 
yeast occurs through two different pathways (Figure 4): Sir2 (for silent information 
regulator 2) dependent or independent pathways.  
 
Figure 4 – Pathways for yeast rDNA  silencing. Sir2-dependent pathway (above the DNA duplex) 
requires the RENT complex (Sir2, Cdc14 and Net1) to deacetylate histones H3 and H4. Sir -
independent pathway (below the DNA duplex) is based on the binding of T of2, Csm1 and  Lrs4 to 
induce rDNA silencing. Both pathways require the binding of Fob1 to the nontranscribed spacer 1 
region to recruit both complexes. Several factors exert positive (black arrow) or negative (red 
blocking signal)  effects on  the rDNA silencing process.  (Image taken from [211]) 
23 
 The former is dependent of the RENT complex (regulator of nucleolar silencing and 
telophase) which is composed of Sir2, Net1 and Cdc14 [217, 218] in which Sir2  exerts its 
deacetylase activity in histones H3 and H4 to start inducing heterochromatin formation 
[219]. As for the Sir2 -independent pathway, a hierarchical binding of the proteins Tof2, 
Csm1 and Lrs4 is also necessary to rDNA silencing [220]. Moreover,  in both these 
pathways  the binding of the complexes to the rDNA  occurs in  the nontranscribed spacer 1 
region, specifically through the i nteraction with Fob1 protein and both act synergistically 
to ensure rDNA silencing at the loci [220]. Several histone modifying enzymes and inner 
nuclear membrane associated proteins are able to modulate the action of thes e two 
pathways (reviewed in [211], Figure 4).   
One of the major differences between mammalian and yeast rDNA gene control is 
that, although also having a proportion of rDNA genes in silent state, DNA methylation  
does not occur in yeast cells  since its genome does not contain DNA methylases. 
However, remodeling of rDNA chromatin in yeast is related with the cell -cycle stage. 
Thus, when cells enter the S stage of the cell -cycle a replication -dependent deposition of 
nucleosomes occurs in almost all the active rDNA genes which will adopt  a closed 
conformation [221]. A similar effect has also been previously observed in a human cell -
line [222]. Re-entrance in G 2 stage leads to Pol I transcription -dependent opening of a 
random subset of rDNA genes [221, 223]. However , when the replication stage is blocked, 
closed rDNA genes start adopting an open conformation stabilized by the HMGB protein 
Hmo1. This protein also stabilizes active rDNA genes when transcription is halted under 
G1 arrest [221]. Other physiological processes such as DNA damage or stationary growth 
have also been associated to chromatin assembly into the active rDNA repeats, which are 
reversible when normal condition are re -established [224, 225]. Importantly, when yeast 
cells enter the stationary phase of growth , the transcription was highly altered but the 
proportion of active/silent genes was very small, suggesting th at in these conditions the 
transcription is primarily regulated rather than the chromatin states of rDNA [225]. 
  24 
 RNA polymerase I machinery and transcription cycle in T. brucei  
 In silico  studies have predicted twelve homologs of the yeast Pol I subunits in T. 
brucei genome, of which ten have already been characterized [226-228] (Table 2). 
Another subunit, the Pol II RPB7 which was suggested to be yeast RPA43 ortholog, was 
also shown to be involved in rDNA and BES transcription in BSFs [229], but later studies 
proved otherwise [230]. On the other hand, it was proposed that RPA31, a subunit only 
conserved amongst trypanosomatids, may be the yeast RPA43 counterpart [227, 230]. 
Also, only the z isoforms of the existing  paralogues of RPB5  (RPB5 an d RPB5z), RPB6 
(RPB6 and RPB6z) and RPB10 (RPB10 and RPB10z) are associated to Pol I [120].  
 Structure of Pol I promoters in T. brucei  is very diversified [231].  Procyclin and 
rDNA promoters are similar between them, while BESs promoters are shorter but 
conserved amongst them. MES promoters are apparently shorter but not conserved 
amongst them. However, even though their structure is different, rDNA promoter is 
interchangeable with a BES promoter [232]. Pol I recruitment to its promoters is 
dependent of class I transcription factor A (CITFA) complex, composed of eight subunits 
[233, 234]. Dynein light chain LC8 subunit binds CITFA2 subunit promoting CITFA complex 
assembly and promoter binding [235], but inte raction of CITFA with Pol I remains 
unknown. Thus, CITFA is highly enriched in rDNA and active BES promoters in BSFs, 
although small levels are also detected in silent BESs promoters [236]. In terms of 
transcription elongation, ELP3b, an ortholog of yeast Pol II Elongator subunit Elp3, might 
have a role in this process as it is a negative regulator of rDNA, b ut surprisingly not BES, 
transcription [237]. Little is known about termination of Pol I transcription in T. brucei .  
 
Epigenetic control of rDNA  genes in T. brucei  
 The epigenetic regulation of ribosomal genes in T. brucei  is still poorly understood. 
Of the 9 rDNA repeats, it is still unknown if all are active or only a fraction. Nonetheless, 
one may speculate that all or almost all possess an open chromatin conformation since 
depletion of histone H1 which is a linker betwe en nucleosomes does not lead to 
conformational changes in rDNA promoters or 18S gene [238]. However, chromatin of 
genes downstream of 18S subunit has not been evaluated.  25

indicate the roles identified for the respective factor.  26 
   So far only three factors are known to infl uence the status of rDNA genes (Table 
3): TDP1, a high mobility group box protein that binds rDNA active repeats and facilitates 
Pol I transcription ( TDP1 will be extensively described in section 1.4.7) [14]; ELP3b, a 
specific rDNA negative regulator of elongation, which possesses a putative histone 
acetyltransfe rase activity although it is still not understood how it inhibits transcription 
[237]; and ISWI has a role as a transcriptional silencer in the rDNA spacer region between 
two repeats, possibly to reinforce this sequence function as an insulator [250]. 
 
Epigenetic control of procyclin loci in T. brucei  
Even though procyclin loci are transcribed by Pol I, their location lies within the 
core of megabase chromosomes 6 and 10 [140]. These loci are subdivided between 
different clusters according to the genes each one shelters [271] (Figure 5). Two clusters 
contain EP1 and EP2 procyclin genes downstream the promoter but while one cluster also 
expresses procyclin associated gene 1 (PAG1), the other cluster expresses PAG2. Other 
PAG gene s may be present downstream, whereas at least PAG1 was shown to serve as an 
insulator for downstream transcription of Pol I [272]. Another cluster is composed by 
GPEET procyclin, followed by  EP3 procyclin, PAG3 and GRESAG2 (gene related to ESAG2) 
genes. EP genes may have different isoforms depending upon parasite strain [56, 273]. 
 
Figure 5 – Organization of the procyclin loci.  Two different EP loci are distinguished by the 
presence of different PAG genes while GPEET locus has a different genomic constitution relative 
to EP loci. (Image adapted from [271]) 
 
Control of procyclin loci is dependent of transcriptional and post -transcriptional 
levels. When inserting a reporter gene with an actin 3’UTR (not developmentally 
27 
 regulated) downstream a procyclin promoter, its mRNA levels were ~8.6 -fold lower in 
BSFs compared to PFs , indicating that the procyclin promoter is down -regulated in BSFs  
[274]. However, procyclin mRNA levels are much lower than 8.6 -fold in BSFs relative to 
PFs. This is due to the elements pr esent in the 3’UTR, which make procyclin mRNA 
unstable in BSFs, prone to rapid turnover as well as affecting the translation [156]. 
Moreover , differentiation stimuli such as temperature, cis-aconitate and incubation 
medium are involved in transcription elongation of procyclin genes [275]. Transcriptional, 
post -transcriptional and translational regulation causes a 1000 -fold downregulation of 
procyclin levels in BSFs [276]. Nonetheless, even within PFs a strict control of expression 
of EP and GPEET is undertaken. Whilst in the first 7 days of differentiation, both EP and 
GPEE T procyclins are expressed, after day 7 only EP procyclin is expressed [277]. GPEET 
mRNA becomes destabilized through a glycerol -responsive element in the 3’UTR, a 
mechanism that is dependent on the activity of mitochondrial enzymes [278].  
Chromatin associated factors also play an i mportant role in the control of 
procyclin expression (Table 3). In PFs, the procyclin loci are located in the nucleolar 
periphery (Figure 6) [11]. In BSFs, it is not directly proven where these loci are located. 
However, upon  knockdown  (KD) of NUP -1 lamina -like protein  in BSFs , which regulates 
nuclear periphery heterochromatin organization, procyclin genes become upregulated 
suggesting that procyclin loci may be positioned in the nuclear periphery [263]. 
Transcription from EP1 loci promoter in BSFs becomes ~4 -fold and ~6 -fold 
upregulated upon nucleoplasmin -like protein  (NLP) and chromatin remodeler ISWI KD, 
respectively [250, 251]. A conditional knock -out of a component of a replication complex 
MCM -BP in BSFs leads to ~5 -8 fold transcript level increase in EP1, while PAG4 and PAG5 
downstream of EP1 are upregulated 8 -15 fold [266]. Also, depletion of the linker histone 
H1 causes a decondensation of chromatin and a concomitant EP1 and EP2 transcriptional 
upregulation [238].

Expression sites in both procyclic and bloodstream forms as well as procyclin loci solely in 
bloodstream forms are tethered to the nuclear p eriphery probably by  NUP -1. Active Bloodstream 
Expression Site in bloodstream forms assumes a more central position to be transcribed, whereas 
procyclin loci in procyclic forms are transcribed perinucleolarly (Image taken from [279]). 
 
Epigenetic control of Expression Sites in T. brucei  
 Control of BES in BSFs is of outmost importance in order to display VSG 
monoallelic expression. For this, all except one BES are required to be in a silent state 
leaving a single BES in an active status. In PFs, all BES need to become silent so th at only 
procyclins become expressed. As for MES, these only become activated specifically in 
metacyclic forms, being tightly repressed in all other life -cycle stages.  
 
Factors involved in the maintenance of silent BESs  
Silent BESs possess a very compact an d nucleosome enriched chromatin [9, 10], 
which most likely ensures a layer of control regarding monoallelic expression. In the 
recent years, several studies identified and characterized epigenetic factors that, once 
depleted, result in transcriptional  derepression  of the promoter region or the telomeric 
29 
 region or  even  the entire  silent BESs  (Table 3) . Below I describe these factors, although it 
is not yet understood how these factors are concerted to maintain a silent BES status.  
 Interestingly, for th e majority of such factors, transcriptional derepression is 
limited to the BES promoter regions without detectable changes in the transcript levels of 
the terminally located VSG genes  or low VSG transcripts are detected but no detectable 
VSG protein is exp ressed . Depletion of t he histone H1  leads to a 4 -14 fold transcriptional 
upregulation including silent VSG genes but protein expression occurred only from 
promoter region genes [238, 239].  In accordance, depletion of histone H3  causes 
expression of a promoter -proximal GFP::NPT reporter cassette [240]. The subunits Spt16 
and Pob3 of the histone chaperone FACT  are important to stabilize compact chromatin 
structure at silent BES promoter regions [252, 253], while  the histone chaperones ASF1A, 
CAF-1b and the his tone deacetylase DAC3 present a marked promoter -proximal 
derepression [12, 240]. The knock -down of t he chromatin remodeler ISWI  or any of its 
interacting factors  RCCP , FYRP  and NLP which  overall  comp ose the ISWI complex also 
cause  derepression of a reporter gene that localizes just downstream the promoter [248-
251]. Additionally histone H1, Spt16 and DAC3 were shown to derepress silent BES also in 
PFs [12, 239, 252]. The role of some of these factors in BES silencing is also tightly 
associated with cell cycle progression since derepression of silent BES promoter regions 
occurs only in S -phase (CAF -1b depleted mutant) or G2/M (histo ne H3, Spt16 and CAF -1b 
depleted mutants) [252, 280].  
Other epigenetic factors are important to silence BESs all the way  until the 
telomere, as loss -of-function mutants result in derepression not only of genes nearby the 
BES promoter but also of silent VSG genes. These factors include the histone H3K76 
methyltransferase DOT1B, the telomeric protein RAP1, the lamin a-like NUP -1, two 
proteins of the replication machinery, ORC1 /CDC6,  MCM -BP and VEX1 (Table 3). 
Moreover, deficiency in any of these factors  results in a significant percentage of 
trypanosomes expressing more than one VSG at the cell surface [245, 258, 266, 267, 270]. 
In contrast, some factors such as the histone deacetylase Sir2rp1 and the putative histone 
acetlytransferase HAT1, appear to be important exclusively for maintaining telomere -
proximal silencing but not for silencing the BESs [242, 281] indicating that the 
mechanisms of epigenetic regulation acting at BESs and telomeres do not simply overlap.   30 
 Although silent BESs chromatin has a closed conformation, transcription is not 
entirely silenced. In fact, the presence of low levels of CITFA in silent BES promoters [236] 
may explain the very low transcript levels observed f rom regions that can reach ESAG 7 
and ESAG 6 [282], even at the single cell level [283]. Moreover, these studies showed that 
multiple silent BES s possess this low transcription level. Interestingly, this same 
phenotype is observed in PFs, where several BES (which are all in a silent state) show a 
slight transcription just downstream the promoter [284].  
Localization of silent BESs within the nucleus may also play an important role for 
BES silencing. FISH analysis suggests that most telomeres co -localize with NUP -1, a 
lamin a-like protein localized at the nuclear periphery that is likely a nuclear lamina 
component [263] (Figure 6) . Depletion of NUP -1 disrupts nuclear morphology and leads to 
re-localization of telomeres from megabase chromosomes to nuclear blebs, with a 
concomitant derepression of silent BESs, indicating that nuclear structure is  important for 
silencing gene expression at BESs. Two enzymes of the inositol phosphate pathway 
(PIP5Pase and PIP5K) were recently shown t o be required for BES silencing  and for the 
correct positioning of telomeres (together with the telomeric protein RAP1 ) and Pol I in 
the nucleus, supporting the impact of nuclear architecture in BES silencing  [264]. It is 
however unknown how these enzymes or their associated metabolites epigenetically 
affect the telomeres and BESs.  
 
Factors involved in the maintenance of the active BES  
The structure and dynamics of the active BES is poorly understood and very few 
epigenetic regulators have been shown to control it , which will now be described (Table 
3).  
Unlike silent BESs, the active BES possesses an open and nucleosome -depleted 
chromatin  [9, 10]. Four proteins have been identified as being important for maintaining 
the transcriptional st atus of the active BES: TDP1, NLP, the Spt16 subunit of FACT  and a 
cohesin component (SCC1). TDP1 is a high mobility group box protein that binds along the 
entire BES and its depletion drives chromatin condensation and a decrease in active VSG 31 
 transcript l evels  [14]. Depletion of NLP also reduces gene expression at the promoter 
region of active BES, although it is not cl ear if this results from an indirect consequence of 
silent BES derepression also resulting from NLP depletion or from a double role of this 
putative chaperone in active and silent BESs. Knockdown of SPT16 also reduces the active 
VSG transcript levels besid es its role in silent BES promoter -proximal silencing  [252]. On 
the other hand, the histone deacetylase DAC1 antagonizes telomeric silencing but has no 
attributed role in gene expression at the active BES  [12]. 
The active BES localizes in  a Pol I extra nucleolar body  termed Expression Site Body  
(ESB), which appears to be a stable nuclear subcompartment in BSFs  [285]. Besides  the 
previous factors, VEX1 is sequestered in the ESB albeit the transcriptional status of the 
active BES is not significantly altered upon KD [270]. Interestingly, depletion of SSC1, a 
component of the cohesin complex, revealed that cohesion is necessary for th e 
epigenetic inheritance of the active transcriptional status of BES  and mediates a delayed 
separation of the sister chromatids  from the active BES locus during early mitosis, 
indicating that both events are probably functionally related [265]. Although th e exact 
composition and the dynamics of this ESB remain elusive, it is possible that it retains 
factors that are essential for the chromatin and transcriptional status necessary for VSG 
expression, thus contributing to monoallelic expression of the unique BES that locates in 
the ESB.  
Post -translational modifications also seem important to maintain the status of the 
active BES. Accumulation of SUMOylated chromatin -associated proteins occurs 
throughout the BES including in the RPA1 subunit of Pol I. Reduced l evels of this 
modification by depletion of a SUMOylation enzyme, the E3 ligase SIZ1, induces a drop in 
the recruitment of Pol I to the active BES and a consequent transcriptional 
downregulation [247]. 
 
Additional layers of BESs control  
During the life cycle of T. brucei , parasites shift between the mammalian host and 
the insect vector  [286]. To survive in such different hosts, significant changes  need to be 32 
 undergone  in gene expression, which include replacement of the VSG by the procyclins  
surface coat  [287]. Silencing of the active BES during differentiation is characterized by a 
progressi ve downregulation of transcription along the BES [288], together with a re -
localization of the BES to the heterochromatic nuclear periphery [11]. This BES re -
localization during differentiation to the nuclear periphery is highly affected by NUP -1 
depletion [263]. It has also been shown that  the chromatin of the originally active BES 
becomes less open to T7 polymerase, suggesting that it acquires a more compact 
structure during differentiation [289]. 
 
How is a MES controlled during the life -cycle?  
 Besides the major difference in genome organization between BES and MES in 
which the former is polycistronic transcription unit and the latter is a monocistronic 
transcription unit, the control of MES is also unique. MES are activated in situ  and are, so 
far, the only genomic region which is subjected to a transcriptional control rather than 
post -transcriptional regulation as transcript levels of mVSGs appear strictly in metacyclic 
forms and in no other life -cycle stage [290, 291]. However, genetic elements such as the 
promoters are involved in this control. When a MES promoter was introduced in a non -
transcribed rDNA spacer in PFs, the promoter remained transcriptionally silent [292]. On 
the contrary, in BSFs, the promoter  activity increased 50 -fold [292]. Moreover,  the 
lamina -like NUP -1, when depleted by  RNA interference  (RNAi ) in PFs, leads to mVSGs 
upregulation of ~6 -22 fold, which suggests that MES localize in the nuclear periphery and 
this localization may be important for complete silencing in other life -cycle stages than 
metacyclic forms [263]. Also, downregulation of ORC1/CDC6 also leads to a ~5 -13 fold 
derepression of mVSGs in PFs, whose biological significance remains unknown [268].

 HIGH MOBILITY GROUP BOX PROTEINS IN RNA  POLYMERASE I 
TRANSCRIPTION  
HMGB  proteins are characterized by their small size, rapid mobility and by 
containing at least one high mobility group box domain, responsible for DNA binding in 
either a sequence or non -sequence specificity [293, 294]. The binding of the HMG -box 
domain to bent, kinked or unwounded DNA allows to  bend, distort or loop DNA  
structures  [295, 296]. HMGB proteins have been reported to fulfill several important roles 
that range from extracellular mediator of inflammatory responses, angiogenesis or 
wound  repair [297-299], to nuclear regulator of essential processes such as transcription, 
replication, DNA repair or V(D)J recombination [300-303].  
 HMGB proteins were shown to influence transcription by three differe nt 
mechanisms: they facilitate nucleosome sliding by chromatin remodeling proteins [304, 
305], they serve as a transient chaperone for stable  binding of transcription factors [306] 
or they participate in transcription blockage as part of a complex that inhibits the 
assembly  of a preinitiation complex on promoters [307]. HMGB proteins also participate 
in the regulation of rDNA  genes, which are transcribed by  RNA polymerase I (Pol I) . 
 
HMO1  
Hmo1 is one of the ten High Mobility Group proteins in S. cerevisiae  that has a role 
in rDNA transcription machinery [308]. It contains two HMG box domains: box A with low 
DNA binding affinity and some structural specificity and box B with high DNA binding 
affinity but lo wer structural specificity [309]. Still, both boxes were shown to be 
important for DNA binding in vivo  and in vitro  [310]. Moreover, Hmo1 contains a lysine -
rich C -terminal region which is important for the DNA bending by the whole protein [311]. 
Hmo1 binds throughout the entire rDNA sequence of the activel y transcribed repeats, 
which are devoid of histones, although it also binds to most promoters of ribosomal 
protein genes that are transcribed by Pol II [312, 313]. In these ribosomal protein gene 
promoters, Hmo1 interacts with TFIID and also delineates the 5’ and 3’ boundaries of the 
PIC assembly zone to direct the transcription initiation in the appropriate site [314, 315]. 
In rDNA genes,  Hmo1 coordinates Pol I transcription under the control of the TOR 34 
 pathway [316] and is able to stabilize the 35S chromatin in an open conformation in the 
absence of Pol I transcription preventing nucleosome assembly outside cell -cycle S stage 
[221].  
Hmo1 has been implicated in other roles other than transcriptional regulation, 
including directing replication -associated DNA lesions to the error -free DNA damage 
tolerance pathway [302], stimulating the nucleosome sliding activity of SWI/SNF and 
ISWIa  chromatin remodelers [305] and stabilizing the chromatin during occurrence of 
DNA double -strand breaks (DSBs) [317]. Hmo1 null -mutants are viable but possess limited 
growth defects [308]. On the other hand, overexpression of Hmo1 leads to a vegetative 
growth [318], although it is able to rescue the growth defects and lethality presented by a 
null-mutant of Rpa 49, a conserved subunit of Pol I [308]. 
 
UBF 
UBF is a bona fide  nucleolar specific HMGB protein common to mammalian 
species and it contains six HMG box domains [185, 294]. There  are two isoforms, UBF1 
and UBF2, with 97 kDa and 94 kDa, respectively, as a consequence of alternative splicing 
[319] and UBF exists in homodime r or heterodimer of these isoforms. However, UBF2 is 
not as efficient as UBF1 since it lacks 37 aminoacids in box domain 2 that are important 
for binding in rDNA promoter [320]. Another study showed that box domain 1 is 
necessary and sufficient to DNA sequence specifi city while box domain 4 might be 
important to establish interactions with SL1 [321]. UBF is distributed throughout the 
entire rDNA active repeats [322]. Multiple roles have been assigned to UBF that include 
involvement not only in transcription, but also in chromatin shaping. In transcription, UBF 
roles encompass the interaction with SL1 to recruit Pol I to the promoter to form the PIC 
[184, 185], activation of transcription by stimulating Pol I promoter escape in the 
transition between initiation and the elongation whe re the interaction with the 
hPAF53/CAST subunit of Pol I is crucial [186, 323] and promoting elongation by 
remodeling and unfolding the enhancesomes for Pol I transcription, an action that is 
dependent of the phosphorylation of box domains 1 and 2 by ERK [324].  35 
 UBF is a potent chromatin regulator as depletion of UBF1 leads to an increase of 
inactive rDNA genes in a methylation -independent manner by promoting higher content 
of linker histone H1 in this inactive chromatin [325]. Moreover, targeting UBF via a lac 
repressor fusion protein to a heterochromatic region induces large scale decondensation 
of the chromatin [326]. Since overexpression of UBF increases rDNA transcription in 
neonatal cardiomyocytes [327], it suggests UBF overexpression and consequent 
chromatin decondensation may lead to the r ecruitment of SL1 and Pol I to induce 
increased transcription.    
 
TDP1  
TDP1 stands for Trypanosome DNA -binding Protein 1 and it was identified as a 
HMG protein by screening an expression cDNA library of T. b. rhodesiense  [13]. TDP1 is 
encoded by a single gene but it results in two stable mRNAs with two different lengths, 
1.6 kb and 2.3 kb. The difference in length is due to differential polyadenylation sites. 
Interestingly, these two mRNA are differentially expressed since the  1.6 kb mRNA 
accounts for 90% of total TDP1 mRNA in BSFs but only 40% in PFs.  
Using RNAi against the coding sequence, it was previously shown that TDP1 
depletion causes growth defects in BSFs but not in PFs [14, 240]. More recently, the 
Ruden ko lab has characterized TDP1 as a HMGB protein with two HMG -box domains and 
a DEK -C DNA binding domain, although lacking the typical acidic C -terminal tail [14]. TDP1 
is enriched in rDNA genes in BSFs and PFs, active BES in BSFs and procyclin genes in both 
PFs and ev en in BSFs, which is consistent with  the low transcriptional differences of 
procyclin between these two life cycle stages  (the high post -transcriptional control of 
procyclin mRNA in BSFs  greatly reduces these levels) . Depletion of TDP1 leads to an 
increase  of histones H1, H2A and H3 content in active BES and rDNA repeats and a 
concomitant decrease of transcripts derived from these loci. Thus, TDP1 is considered a 
Pol I transcription facilitator functionally related with Hmo1 and UBF.  
 
  36 
 ANTIGENIC VARIATION  
Antigenic variation is a sophisticated mechanism that several pathogens employ to 
evade the host immune system, which only provides a temporary natural immunity. 
Understanding this process is of outmost importance as the most successful vaccines are 
effect ive against low antigenic diversity pathogens and new therapeutic strategies are 
required.  
The ability to change the immunogenic epitopes recognized by the immune 
system  is found in  viruses , bacteria and several  eukaryotic pathogens . In Influenza  virus, 
the surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) may suffer changes 
through specific processes termed antigenic drift and antigenic shift [328]. The former is 
based on aminoacid substitutions in HA and/or NA and the latter shows a new subtype of 
mixed HA and  NA. Selection pressure in the environment is involved these processes. 
Borrelia hermsii , a bacterial spirochete that causes relapsing fever, expresses only one 
variable major protein (Vmp) from a repertoire of genes at the outer surface [329]. The 
switch of Vmps occurs by gene conversion, specifically a silent promoter -less vmp  gene  
cassette is recombined into the single vmp expression site near the telomere of a linear 
plasmid  [330, 331]. Plasmodium falciparum , the causative agent of malaria, uses antigenic 
variation of P. falciparum  erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) during blood stage 
to maintain a chronic infection [332]. For this, only 1 out of 60 var genes is expressed at a 
time and during each red blood cell invasion a epigenetic -dependent switch to another 
var gene may occur.  
All T. brucei  subspecies undergo  antigenic variation of the VSG  to evade the host 
immune system and establish persistent infections [333]. Other trypanosome species like 
T. congolense , T.vivax  and T. equiperdum  are also able to undergo antigenic variation 
using VSGs [334, 335]. Nonetheless, T. cruzi , the causative agent of Chagas disease, is an 
intracellular parasite which does not use antigenic variation although expressing variable 
surface proteins [336]. However,  it was recently shown that in vivo antigenic variation is 
very complex with several variants of VSGs present in a single host to maintain chronicity 
[337]. In T. brucei  antigenic variation relies on two main features , monoallelic expression 
of VSG an d periodic switching of VSG, which will now be addressed.  37 
 Monoallelic expression  
Monoallelic gene expression or allelic exclusion refers to the process by which  only 
one allele of a given gene (or gene family) is expressed . One of the most well studied 
examples of allelic exclusion is the expression of olfactory receptor (OR) genes in the 
olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). Each OSN expresses a single allele of a single gene out 
of a family of ~1100 (in mice) or ~630 (in huma ns) OR genes [338]. In an immature OSN, 
OR gene clusters are marked with the constitutive heretochromatin marks H3K9me3 and 
H4K20me3 [339]. Histone demethylase LSD1 and additional unidentified chromatin 
remodellers remove the histone modifications of only one OR gene, allowing its 
derepression and activation [340]. Transcription and expression of a non -functional or 
mutated OR leads to switching to anot her OR transcription until translation of  a 
functional OR elicits a feedback based mechanism to stably express only that OR [341]. 
This feedback mechanism starts by activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), 
which ultimately increases translation of ATF5 [342]. ATF5 will induce the transcription of 
adenylyl cyclase 3 that relieves the UPR and downregulates LSD1, preventing other ORs 
from being expressed. This processes will ultimately establish expression of only one OR 
and trigger the differentiation to mature OSN [340]. 
Monoallelic expression of var genes in Plasmodium falciparum  leads to the 
expression of a single PfEMP1 protein, the surface recept or encoded by a var gene.  
However, this does not strictly mean that PfEMP1, needs to be produced. In fact, 
replacing a var gene by a drug -selectable marker abolishes expression of PfEMP1 but 
parasites are viable and switching may still occur in the absenc e of drug pressure [343]. 
Thus, upstream elements in the promoter are the “counting” mechanism that controls 
the transcription of a single var gene locus. All var genes, except the active one, in 
heterochromatic perinuclear repressive centers enriched in H3K9me3 [344]. The active 
var gene is also positioned in the perinuclear region but segregated from the silent var 
genes and the promoter is enriched in H3K 4me2/3, H3K9ac and H2AZ which are 
permissiv e marks for transcription [332]. Within the red blood cells and prior to DNA 
replication, the active var gene promoter becomes poised and enriched in H3K4me2 and 
only becomes active after new invasion of red blood cells [345]. This is accomplished by 
the histone methyltransferase PfSET10 , which  might serve as a mark for inheritable 38 
 expression of the same var gene [346]. Nonetheles s, Plasmodium  can switch the 
expression of the var genes although it is not understood in which stage of the cell cycle 
this is accomplished.  
T. brucei  also ensures monoallelic expression by expressing a single VSG gene 
amongst more than 2500 genes or pseudogenes. However, the control of monoallelic 
expression does not imply that only one VSG is stably expressed. When a second VSG 
gene is inserted into the active BES, both VSGs are expressed and homogenously 
distrib uted at the cell surface in equal amounts [347]. On the other hand, when parasites 
were forced to simultaneously transcribe two tagged BESs  using drug pressure, rapid 
switching between the two BES occurred instead of obtain ing a stable double expressor 
[348]. These studies suggest that T. brucei  has a mechanism to avoid multiple VSGs from 
being simultaneously expressed in natural conditions at the cell surface. Recently, VEX1 
protein is both a negative and a positive regulator of monoallelic expression, being 
sequestered in the active BES to ensure monoallelic expression in a “winner takes all” 
process [270]. RNAi against VEX1 leads to loss of silent BES silencing in a homology 
sequence -dependent manner, while overexpression of VEX1 leads to its accumulation in 
silent BES leading in both cases to upregulation of silent VSGs  and expression of several 
VSGs at t he cell surface . On the other hand, RNAi against the VSG mRNA leads to a 
precytokinesis cell -cycle arrest [349]. 
 
VSG switching  
 To evade  the host’s immune system and maintain a chronic infection, T. brucei  
changes the dense coat of homodimeric VSGs, which is believed to be the only parasite 
antigen against which an immune response is mounted. The two mechanisms by which 
the expressed VSG is switched are switching by recombination  and the epigenetic BES 
tran scriptional  in situ  switching (Figure 7). Several types of recombination may occur: 
exchange of sequences between the active and a silent BES, duplication of VSG genes 
from the internal silent arrays or minichromosomes to replace the active VSG and 
assembl y of fragments of VSG pseudogenes into the active VSG to create mosaic VSGs. In 
terms of activation of these routes, in situ switching and BES exchanges arise early in 
infection, being replaced by the usages of the archival VSGs from the internal arrays an d 39 
 minichromosomes and only late in infection mosaic VSGs are assembled [337, 350]. I will 
briefly revisit recombinational switching mechanisms while transcriptional switching will 
be more detailed.  
 
Figure 7 – Different mechanisms for VSG switching in T. brucei . Gene conversion is based on the 
duplication of a VSG from the internal arrays or minichromosomes in order to replace the VSG in 
the active BES. Segmental gene conversion generates mosaic VSGs from fragments of different 
VSG genes or pseudogenes that will ultimately replace the VSG in the active BES. Telomere 
exchange results in DNA sequence cross -over from an active and a silent BES, which can span 
from recombining only the VSG gene to the whole BES. Transcriptional switch consists in 
transcripti onally inactivating the active BES, with the concomitant activation of a previously silent 
BES. (Image taken from [351]) 
 
Switching by recombination  
 Recombinational switching is dependent of DNA DSBs, which is facilitated by the 
fact that subtelomeric regions (where BES s are located) are hotspots for recombination 
processes. Homologous recombination (HR) is a pathway to repair DSB with an important 
role towards VSG switching. This pathway is dependent of RAD51, an enzyme that, when 
inactivated, results in impaired VSG switchi ng [352]. BRCA2 protein which interacts with 
RAD51 also impairs HR [353]. Break -induced replication (BIR) is a HR mechanism that is 
used for exchange of sequences between the a ctive and a silent BES (telomere exchange 
40 
 in Figure 7) [7]. BIR is frequently used when a DSB is generated in the 70 -bp repeat 
upstream of the VSG gene, allowing translocation of the VSG gene together with the 
telomeric repeats. Extended regions even until the BES promoter may also be 
translocated, although this event is somewhat rare [6]. However, the major HR 
mechanism is gene conversion [354]. In gene conversion, the archival intact VSGs are 
duplicated together with the flanking 70 -bp repeats and a second recombination junction 
is generated in the VSG 3’UTRs contain where highly conserved elements may serve as  
recombination locus [5]. This allows translocation of a new VSG into the active BES but 
maintaining telomeric sequences. Segmental gene conversion is termed for the 
generation of mosaic VSGs since  only fragments of silent pseudogenes are recombined to 
yield new VSG genes [355, 356]. This ability to generate mosaic VSGs allows to 
exponentially increase the potential V SG archive size turning it in the core of antigenic 
variation and chronic infections [357]. Besides HR, the microhomology mediated end -
joining, a non -RAD51 dependent mechanism, can also contribute for recombinational 
switching possibly through the 70 -bp repeats [358]. 
 DSBs in the active BES were shown to be natural intermediates of VSG gene 
conversion [359], which may be a consequence of replication  fork collapse or the fragile 
nature of subtelomeric regions [358, 360]. However, the probability and mechanism of 
switching employed after a DSB may depend on the break site: a promote r-adjacent 
break does not lead to switching, a 70 -bp repeat associated break frequently results in a 
RAD51 -dependent gene conversion with a G 2/M cell -cycle arrest while a break in 
telomeric sequences bypasses the G 2/M cell -cycle checkpoint and consequently  leads to a 
loss or replacement of the entire BES [358]. Nonetheless, it was recently proposed that it 
is not a self -induced DSB that initiates a switching event but rather a replicating -
dependent process where collisions of transcription and replicating machineries create an 
instable environment that is favorable to induce switching [361].  Also, a probabilistic 
order in terms of the hierarchy of VSG activation and replacement has been shown to 
influence recombination to maintain chronic infections [362, 363]. 
 The length of the telomeric repeats has also been shown to work as  a cue to 
induce VSG switching. Thus, in telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) null mutants, 41 
 which are not able to maintain extend telomeric repeats, the shortening of telomeric 
sequence to very few repeats leads to VSG gene conversion [257, 259] 
In situ  switching  
BES transcriptional  switching (or  in situ  switching) consists in silencing the active 
BES with the concomitant activation of a silent BES, thus maintaining monoallelic 
expression  [8]. Because chromatin of the active and s ilent BESs is dramatically different, 
BES switching involves important modifications in chromatin structure, which are likely 
very well coordinated with changes in the transcriptional machinery.  
All of the factors important for this type of switching also  play a role in VSG 
monoallelic expression consistent with a interdependent control of both processes: 
cohesin represses in situ  switching without affecting recombination -mediated switching 
[265]; ORC1 represses preferentially BES transcriptional switching [267]; NUP1 was 
proposed to keep silent BESs away from the ESB therefore preventing switching events 
[263]; DOT1B is considered a central factor in promoting fast in situ  switching events since 
its depletion causes cells to express more than one VSG at the cell surface up to several 
weeks until VSG coat replacement is completed [245]. Moreover , inositol phosphate 
pathway regulates switching apparently through a telomere -dependent manner, since 
PIP5K represses both recombination -dependent and in situ  switchin g [264]. How these 
factors act together to allow a fast and well -coordinated transcriptional switch remains 
totally unknown.  
When two different BES marked with drug resistance genes were forced to be 
simultaneously expressed, rapid and permanent  back and forth switches between the 
two BES were apparently prompted to guarantee drug resistance [348]. No parasites 
were obtained that simultaneously expressed two BESs, suggesting the presence of a 
mechanism that prevents such situation from happening and thus ensuring VSG 
monoallelic expression. The authors postulated the existence of natural unstable 
switching intermediates in which silent BESs are in a pre -active state that facilitates a 
transcriptional interchange.  42 
 The co -transposed region (CTR), a non -coding sequence located between the 70 -
bp repeats and the VSG gene, gave insight on BES stability. De letion of the CTR led to an 
increase of more than 100 -fold in BES switching frequency which became more severe if 
the start codon of the active VSG is also deleted together with the CTR [364]. Recently, a 
study showed that the ectopic expression of a second VSG from a non -BES locus 
promotes attenuation of transcription from the whole active BES [365]. This VSG 
silencing/attenuation is reversible and mediated by DOT1B. This study proposes that 
activation of a silent VSG may act as a trigger for transcriptional sw itching, suggest ing that 
transcriptional attenuation is an intermediate state that allows probing for  the integrity 
and functionally of a new BES before full commitment for switching. However, in light of 
current knowledge one cannot define what is the true trigger that drives switching.  
 An in situ  switching is much poorly characterized compared to recom binational 
switching. Nonetheless, the former mechanism cannot be disregarded as it assumes high 
importance in initial stages of the infection. In this dissertation, I propose to unveil the 
role of chromatin conformation of BESs not only in the context of an in situ  switching, but 
also in the control of monoallelic VSG expression.

 THESIS AIMS  
 Antigenic variation is a powerful mechanism used by several pathogens to evade 
the host immune system [351]. The extracellular parasite, Trypanosoma brucei , 
periodically changes the variant surface glycoproteins (VSGs) present at the cell surface to 
maintain an infection for long periods of time [97]. Each parasite expresses a single  VSG 
gene from one of ~15 bloodstream expression sites (BES), which are transcribed by RNA 
polymerase I (Pol I) [4, 93]. 
While the majority of the pathogens change the exposed surface proteins by 
employing recombination -based processes, T. brucei  parasites use not only 
recombination -based but also epigenetic processes [351]. During an in situ  switch, the 
active BES is silenced and a previously silent BES is activate d, resulting in the expression 
of a new VSG [8]. Work from Figueiredo and other labs had previously shown that the 
highly transcribed active BES possesses a very open and nucleosome depleted chromatin 
structure while silent BES possesses a compact nucleosome enriched chromatin [9, 10].  
These observations led me to ask how chromatin and transcriptional changes 
intertwine durin g an in situ  switching .  Since switching is rare and very difficult to observe, 
we used a reporter system that greatly induces the frequency of in situ  switching [12].  
At the onset of this work we established a number of specific aims. First, to 
generate and to characterize a BES transcriptional silencing inducible system with a 
transcription al reporter. Second, to observe how the chromatin behaves upon inducing a 
BES transcriptional silencing. Finally, to identify and characterize the protein 
component(s) that mediate the interplay between chromatin and transcription during 
VSG in situ  switch ing.  
This work relied on the use several methodologies ranging from established in 
vitro  assays, generation of parasite transgenic cell -lines, double -stranded RNA (dsRNA) 
assay , formaldehyde -assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE), chromatin 
immunoprecipitation (ChIP), western blotting and flow cytometry  were employed .  44 
 With this project, we expect to have a better understanding of the regulation of an 
in situ  switching, which could ultimately lead to the identification of intervention 
strateg ies that may block this mechanism and impair the progression of the infection.

 INTRODUCTION  
RNA Polymerase I (Pol I) transcribes ribosomal DNA genes ( rDNA ), which account 
for over 60% of total nuclear transcripti on [163]. Most organisms have large tandem 
arrays of rDNA  genes, but only a fraction is transcriptionally active. Consistent with their 
transcriptional activity, rDNA  genes can be found in one of two chromatin states: a 
compact nucleosome -rich “closed state” and an accessible nucleosome -depleted 
chromatin “open state” [195]. In yeast, replication of DNA converts the chromatin of most 
rDNA  genes into the closed state. When replication is complete and transcription is 
reinitiated, a stochastic fraction of rDNA  genes regains the open state, in a process that is 
dependent on Pol I. Once chromatin has an open state, its status is maintained by a high -
mobility box protein, HMO1, independent from Pol I [221]. 
Trypanosoma brucei , a unicellular parasite responsible for sleeping sickness, is an 
unusual eukaryote that also uses Pol I to transcribe genes that encode two classes of 
abundant surface proteins, the Variant Surface Glycoprotein (VSG) and Procyclins [4, 
366]. Periodic exchange of the exposed VSG allows the parasites to evade the host 
immune system, a process known as antigenic variation. Although the T. brucei  genome 
has more than 2000 VSG genes [91], only one is transcribed at any give n time. VSGs are 
transcribed from Bloodstream Expression Sites (BESs), specialized polycistronic units in 
which a Pol I promoter drives transcription towards the telomere. Between the promoter 
and the telomere there is a variable number of expression -site-associated genes (ESAGs) 
followed by an array of tandem 70 -bp repeats that precede the telomere -proximal VSG 
[93]. Among the approximately 15 BESs present in the genome, only one is functionally 
active, ensuring the monoallelic expression t hat is the heart of antigenic variation.  
VSG switching can happen by two main mechanisms, by recombining a new VSG 
into the active BES or by switching off a BES and activating another one ( in situ  or 
transcriptional switch) [367]. VSG transcriptional switching involves two BESs, one that is 
silenced and another that is concomitantly activated. Cross -talk a mong BESs has been 
proposed to explain the phenotype observed when two BESs were simultaneously 
selected with drug selectable markers [348]. Davies et al . also detected that deletion of a 
non-coding DNA sequence upstream of the activ e VSG, increased switching frequency to 
a new BES [364]. More recently, Batram et al.  showed that upon overexpression of an 48 
 exogenous VSG, the active BES is partially attenuated into an intermediate stage, which 
may allow probing of silent BESs before commitment to one [368].  
While in the mammalian -infective bloodstream stage, the chromat in of the active 
and silent BESs is dramatically different. The actively transcribed BES is nucleosome -
depleted (open state), while silent BESs are organized in regularly spaced nucleosomes [9, 
10]. The promoters of both active and silent BESs are bound by the multi -subunit class I 
transcri ption factor A (CITFA) [233], although to a different extent [236], which is 
necessary to regulate BES transcription initiation. Several epigenetic factors have been 
shown to be necessary to prevent transcription from silent BESs [369]; others  are 
necessary to ensure fast switching between BESs [245], but only TDP1 has been shown to 
be a core component of the active BES. TDP1 is a high mobility group box protein that is 
present in the chromatin of active BES, and at rDNA  genes, and it is necessary for their 
transcription [13, 14]. The interplay among these factors and the mechanisms by which 
they affect VSG transcription are essentially unknown.  
During the life cycle of T. brucei , parasites shift between the mammalian host and 
the Tsetse fly [286]. To survive in such different hosts, parasites undergo significant 
changes in gene expression, which include replacement of the VSG by the similarly 
abundant procyclins [287]. Silencing of the active BES during differentiation is 
characterized by a progressive downregulation of transcription along the BES [288], 
together with a re -localization of the BES to the heterochromatic nuclear periphery [11]. 
It has also been shown that the chromatin of the originally active BES becomes less open 
to T7 polymerase, suggesting that it acquires a more compact structure during 
differentiation [289]. 
The goal of this chapter  was to understand the int erplay between transcription 
and chromatin during antigenic variation. We characterized the early events that take 
place when the active BES is silenced. We found that trypanosomes have a cell -cycle and 
transcription -independent mechanism to maintain the o pen chromatin conformation of 
the active BES, which is dependent upon TDP1. We also observed that, in the first two 
days after transcriptional silencing is induced, parasites experience an intermediate stage 
in which several previously silent BESs are temp orarily transcribed at higher levels, 49 
 suggesting that cells probe different BESs before commitment to a new single BES. Our 
findings provide evidence that regulating chromatin conformation is tightly associated to 
antigenic switching, an important virulenc e mechanism of this pathogen.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS  
Trypanosome cell -lines and plasmid construction  
T. brucei  bloodstream form (BSF) parasites (strain Lister 427, antigenic type MiTat 
1.2, clone 221a) [370] were cultured in HMI -11 as described in [371]. PL1A cell -line was 
described in [258] and grown with 2.5 g/ml of G418 and 1 g/ml of Puromycin 
(Invivogen). All transfections were made with a nucleofector (AMAXA), program X -001, 
using the previously optimized homemade Tb -BSF buffer ( 90 mM Na2HPO 4, 5 mM KCl, 
0.15 mM CaCl2 , 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.3) [372]. GLB1 and its derivative cell -lines were 
modified from the parental 2T1.ESPiGFP:NPT [12] and grown with 2.5 g/ml of 
Phleomycin, 0.1 g/ml of Puromycin, 10 g/ml of Blasticidin -S (Invivogen) and 1 g/ml of 
Tetracycline (Fisher Scientific). The NPT gene in the 2T1.ESPiGFP:NPT  cell-line was 
replaced by luciferase reporter by transfecting a PCR product containing a stop codon for 
the GFP gene, an Aldolase  3’ UTR, Luciferase  and BSR genes (previously cloned in pFAB2). 
PCR was performed using primers with long tails  (Table 4) whic h serve as target 
recombination regions for GFP ORF (open reading frame)  and the BES sequence 
downstream of GFP::NPT  3’ UTR.  
GLB1 -TDP1::TY1 was generated by transfecting pFAB11, which inserts a TY1 tag in 
the 3’ end of one of the TDP1  endogenous alleles. pFAB11 contains a (i) Hygromycin 
resistance  gene, (ii) a 5’ -end truncated TDP1 , (iii) a TY1 tag in the 3’ -end of TDP1 , (iv) an 
Aldolase  3’UTR. pFAB11 was linearized with Sma I (New England Biolabs), which digests in 
the middle of TDP1  ORF. GLB1 -TDP1::3xcMyc  was generated by transfecting pFAB14 
which inserts a triple MYC tag in the 3’ end of one of the TDP1  endogenous alleles. 
pFAB14 contains a (i) Hygromycin resistance  gene, (ii) a 5’ -end truncated TDP1 , (iii) a 
triple MYC tag in the 3’ -end of TDP1 , (iv) the  annotated endogenous 3’UTR of TDP1 . 
pFAB14 was linearized with Sma I (New England Biolabs), which digests in the middle of 
TDP1  ORF.  
GLB1 -R15 was obtained by first generating switchers of GLB1 using the BES 
silencing inducible assay and subsequently transfecting pFAB17 in switchers. pFAB17 
contains a (i) a 405 nucleotide sequence upstream BES promoter, (ii) BES promoter, (iii) 
an RFP ORF lackin g NLS, PEST and stop codon amplified from pCAGGS, (iv) a NPT ORF 51 
 lacking the start codon, (v) an Actin  3’UTR, (vi) a 475 nucleotide sequence downstream 
BES promoter. RFP and NPT ORFs formed the fused RFP::NPT  gene. pFAB17 was digested 
with AscI and NdeI (New England Biolabs) prior to transfection. Selection of clones was 
performed with 25 g/ml of G418. Cloning of VSG transcripts and sequencing allowed 
identification of the BES in which RFP::NPT  had integrated. Transfected switchers were 
reverted to the ori ginal BES by removing G418 and adding 1 g/ml of Tetracycline to the 
medium. Afterwards, serial dilutions were performed and 10 g/ml of Blasticidin -S was 
added to each dilution to select revertants.  
All cloning was performed using the In -Fusion® HD Cloni ng system (Clontech) 
following to the manufacturer’s instructions.  
Differentiation assay  
Parasites were collected at a density of 1 – 1.5 × 106 cells/ml and centrifuged at 
650 g for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were resuspended in DTM medium with 6 
mM of cis-aconitate at a density of 1.5 – 2 × 106 cells/ml and grown at 27ºC without CO 2. 
Transcript quantification  
Parasites were harvested by c entrifugation at 650 g  for 10 min, 4 C and 
immediately resuspended in PureZOL (BioRad) or TRIzol (Invitrogen). RNA was isolated 
following the manufacturer’s instructions and RNA quantity and quality was assessed on a 
NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific). cDNA  was generated using a Superscript cDNA 
Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen), according to manufacturer’s protocol. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) 
was performed using 1× SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Negative 
controls lacking reverse transcriptase (RT -) were confirmed by q uantitative PCR (qPCR) . 
Amplification reactions were performed in duplicates. The Ct method as used to 
determine transcript levels relative to normalizing gene.  
Tetracycline -inducible BES silencing assay  
Parasites were centrifuged at 65 0 g and washed three times with warm HMI -11. 
Pellets were resuspended in medium with drugs except Blasticidin -S and tetracycline and 
density was adjusted to 0.5 × 106 cells/ml. Cells were split in two flasks with and without 
Blasticidin -S and tetracycline (Tet+ and Tet -, respectively).  52 
 Survival frequency and commitment assay  
To determine the percentage of cells that survive the BES -silencing assay, after 
washing away drugs, cells were diluted to a density of 10 cells/ml and plated in two 96 -
well plates with  or without tetracycline (Tet+ and Tet -, respectively). Seven days after 
plating, surviving clones were counted in Tet - and Tet+ plates and its ratio yielded the 
survival frequency. For commitment assay, cell density of Tet - cultures was determined at 
8, 24, 48 and 72 hours after BES silencing and subsequently diluted to a density of 10 or 
50 cells/ml containing 1 g/ml of tetracycline. Dilutions were performed with the same 
drugs and complemented with 1 g/ml of tetracycline. Diluted cells were then plated  in 
two 96 -well plates. All plates containing tetracycline were replenished with fresh 
tetracycline three days after plating to maintain excess concentration. Six days later, 
around 20 surviving wells were passaged to new 96 -well plates and were analyzed b y a 
FACS High Throughput Sampler (BD Biosciences) to score for expression of GFP.  
Cell-cycle profile after BES silencing  
At each time point after inducing BES silencing, 2 million cells were centrifuged for 
10 min at 1300 g, 4ºC and washed once with ice -cold PBS. Cells were resuspended in PBS 
with 2 mM EDTA and slowly fixed with 2.5 ml of absolute ethanol. After fixing for at least 
one hour, cells were washed once and resuspended in 1 ml PBS / EDTA. Cells were 
incubated with 10 g RNase A and 1 g of propid ium iodide for 30 min at 37ºC and 
further analyzed by flow cytometry for DNA content.  
Luciferase assay  
1.5 × 106 cells were harvested for 5 min at 2800 g, 4ºC and washed once with 1 ml 
cold TDB. Pellets were resuspended in Lysis Buffer (Biotium) and protoc ol was followed 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Luminescence was measured by a 
microplate reader (Tecan).  
FAIRE  
Formaldehyde -assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE) was performed as 
described previously [238]. Briefly, 20 million cells were centrifuged for 20 min at 3000 g, 
resuspended in 20 ml of HMI -11 and crosslinked with 1.1% Formaldehyde (Sigma) for 10 53 
 min. In cell -cycle sorted fractions, protocol was performed with only 1 -2 million cells. 
Crosslinking wa s stopped with 0.125 M of Glycine (Sigma) and cells were washed once 
with Trypanosome Dilution Buffer (TDB) ( 5 mM KCl, 80 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgSO 4, 20 mM 
Na2HPO 4, 2 mM NaH 2PO 4, 20 mM glucose, pH 7.4) . Cell pellets were lysed with Lysis 
Buffer (50 mM TrisHCl, 10  mM EDTA, 1% SDS) complemented with Protease Inhibitor 
Cocktail (Sigma) and Solution P (PMSF, Pepstatin). Lysates were incubated on ice for 15 
min and an external plasmid DNA spike was added before sonicating with 10 cycles of 30 
sec on / off. Lysates were  centrifuged at 16000 g, 4ºC to pellet cell debris and a 100 l 
aliquot of the supernatant was taken to check sonication efficiency. The remaining 
fraction was subjected to two Phenol -Chloroform -Isoamyl Acid (25:24:1) (Sigma). DNA 
present in the aqueous ph ase, corresponding to open chromatin, was precipitated and 
washed with 2 volumes of absolute ethanol, sodium acetate 0.3 M and 20 g/ml glycogen 
overnight at -20ºC DNA was washed once with ethanol 70% and dried before 
resuspension in Elution Buffer (Quiage n). Samples were then treated with 100 g/ml of 
RNase A (ROTH) and purified with a PCR purification kit (Quiagen). A non -crosslinked 
sample was always included to normalize qPCR data for gene copy number. 
Quantification of the FAIRE and total DNA samples w ere analyzed by qPCR. Amplification 
reactions were performed in duplicates.  
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation  
ChIP was carried out essentially as described elsewhere [9] but with several 
modifications. A total of 3 -5 × 107 cells were harvested for 10 min at 3000 g and fixed for 
20 min in 1% formaldehyde solution (50 mM HEPES -KOH pH7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM 
EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA and 11% formaldehyde) in HMI -9 medium. Crosslinking was stopped 
with 0.125 M of Glycine and cells were w ashed once with PBS. Cells were first lysed with 
10 ml lysis buffer 1 (50 mM HEPES -KOH pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 
0.5% Tergitol, 0.25% Triton X -100 plus protease inhibitor cocktail) and incubated for 10 
min at 4ºC. Upon spinning for 20 m in at 4000 g, 4ºC, the pellet was lysed with 10 ml of 
lysis buffer 2 (10 mM Tris -HCl pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA plus 
protease inhibitor cocktail) for 10 min at room temperature. After spinning for 20 min at 
4000 g, 4ºC, the pellet was lyse d with 2 ml of lysis buffer 3 (10 mM Tris -HCl pH 8.0, 100 
mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.1% Na -Deoxycholate, 0.5% N -lauroylsarcosine 54 
 plus protease inhibitor cocktail). DNA was sonicated in a Bioruptor UCD -200 (DIAGENODE) 
for 10 min total (30 -s on and o ff cycles). After sonication, 200 l of 10% Triton X -100 was 
added, samples were split into two microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged for 10 min at 
16100 g at 4ºC. 50 l were taken for the input sample and 100 l to assess sonication 
efficiency. To the rem aining 2 ml, 0.7 ml of lysis buffer 3, 0.3 ml of 10% Triton X -100 plus 
protease inhibitor cocktail was added. Lysate was incubated with Dynabeads Protein G 
(Life Technologies) combined with 10 g of rabbit anti -H3 antibody (kind gift from 
Christian Janzen)  or mouse anti -TY1 antibody (clone BB2, The Rockefeller University) 
overnight at 4°C. Immunoprecipitated material was washed seven times with cold RIPA 
buffer (50 mM HEPES -KOH, 500 mM LiCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP -40 and 0.7% Na -
Deoxycholate) and once with 10 mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl. Material 
was reverse crosslinked with 200 l Elution Buffer (50 mM Tris -HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 
1% SDS) for 12 -14 hr at 65ºC. Samples were treated with 80 g of RNase A for 2 hr at 
37ºC and then with 80 g of Proteina se K for 2 hr at 55ºC before being purified using a 
Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). Immunoprecipitated material was quantified by qPCR. 
Amplification reactions were performed in duplicates.  
Cell-cycle sorting  
108 cells were centrifuged for 10 min at 650 g, re suspended in 20 ml of HMI -11 
and crosslinked with 1.1% formaldehyde (Sigma) for 10 min. Crosslinking was stopped 
with 0.125 M of Glycine (Sigma) and cells were washed once with PBS and resuspended in 
1 ml PBS / 2 mM EDTA. Cells were permeabilized for 5 min  with 40 mM digitonin, washed 
twice with PBS and resuspended in 1 ml PBS / 2 mM EDTA. Staining was performed with 1 
l FxCycle Violet Stain (Molecular Probes) for 30 min protected from light. Cells were 
sorted according to their DNA content using a FACS Ar ia sorter (BD Biosciences) and 
collected in PBS.  
dsRNA production  
dsRNA against TDP1 were made using the MEGAscript RNAi Kit (Ambion) and 
protocol was followed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The sequence used 
to deplete TDP1 mRNA is identical to the one published in [14]. 20 g of dsRNA or the  
same buffer volume (for the mock control) were transfected into 100 million cells, using 
the X -001 program, and the homemade Tb -BSF buffer in an AMAXA nucleofector. The 55 
 primers  used for amplification of DNA template include a T7 promoter for in vitro  
tran scription and are presented in Table 4.

Western Blotting  
Cells were lysed using Laemmli buffer, resuspended at 2 × 105 cells/l and treated 
with 200 U/ml Benzonase (Sigma). A SDS -PAGE was performed at 4ºC and proteins were 
transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using an iBlot Dry Blotting System (Invitrogen) 56 
 for 6 min and 30 sec. Membrane was blocked with 5% milk in PBS / 0.1% Tween for at 
least 1 hour and primary mouse anti -cMyc antibody (clone 9E10, The Rockefeller 
University) was incubated overnight at 4ºC in a 1:1000 dilution in 3% milk in PBS / 0.1% 
Tween. Membrane was washed three times with PBS / 0.1% Tween, and incubated  with 
anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase -linked secondary antibody (Amersham) at room 
temperature for 1 hr in a 1:20000 dilution in 3% milk in PBS / 0.1% Tween. Membrane 
was further washed three times with PBS / 0.1% Tween and developed with a Western 
Light ning Plus -ECL (PerkinElmer). Picture acquisition was made by a Chemidoc XRS+ (Bio -
Rad). For loading control histone H2A, membrane was stripped with the Restore PLUS 
Western Blot Stripping Buffer (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructi ons and blocked again with 5% milk in PBS / 0.1% Tween for at least 1 hr. Primary 
rabbit anti -H2A antibody (custom made) was incubated for 1 hr at room temperature in a 
1:5000 dilution in 3% milk in PBS / 0.1% Tween. The remaining protocol was followed as 
above except for the secondary antibody which was an anti -rabbit horseradish 
peroxidase -linked antibody (Amersham).  
Quantification was performed using the Image Lab software (Bio -Rad). 
Background intensity was subtracted from each band and intensity of TDP 1::cMyc band 
was normalized to the loading control and to mock transfected control.  
VSG staining of live cells  
0.5 × 106 cells were harvested for 5 min at 2800 g, 4ºC. Cells were resuspended in 
50l of cold HMI -11 in which Alexa Fluor 647 anti -VSG13 conjug ated antibody had been 
previously diluted (1:5000). After 15 min of incubation at 4ºC with gentle shaking, cells 
were washed three times in cold TDB, resuspended in cold TDB, and immediately 
analyzed on a FACS Fortessa (Becton Dickinson Biosciences). Data were processed with 
FlowJo software (FlowJo, LLC).

 RESULTS  
Transcription and chromatin dynamics during differentiation  
When a bloodstream parasite undergoes transcriptional VSG switching or when it 
differentiates into procyclic forms, the active BES must be silenced and its chromatin 
closed [9, 10, 289]. In both processes, the interplay between transcription and chromatin 
is unknown. What is the order of these events: does chromatin condensation lead to a 
transcriptional silencing, or does transcription stop first and chromatin is condensed 
later? We began to tackle this problem by characterizing what happens during 
differentiation ( Figure 8), and then in VSG switching ( Figure 9). 
To study the interplay between transcriptional silencing and chromatin 
condensation in the active BES during differentiation, we induced cell differentiation in 
vitro  by adding the chemical trigger cis-aconitate and lowering the temperature from 
37ºC to 27 ºC. We measured levels of mRNA at different time points, using a cell -line in 
which BES1 is actively transcribed ( Figure 8A). As expected, VSG2  transcript levels rapidly 
decreased, reaching 2% of the bloodstream form levels, 24 hr after inducing 
differenti ation ( Figure 8B). Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) 18S transcripts remained unchanged, 
as expected [288], and transcript levels of silent VSG9 were slightly reduced. As previously 
observed, transcript levels of RNA Po lymerase II (Pol II) -transcribed genes, -tubulin  and 
GAPDH , also decreased [50, 288, 373], the second reflecting the reduced metabolic 
dependence of glycolysis in procyclic forms.  
To test if this transcriptional silencing of the active BES was a consequence of 
chromatin conformat ional changes, we assessed nucleosome occupancy during 
differentiation by FAIRE [374] (Figure 8C). This technique allows the purification and 
quantification of DNA with low protein content from what we call a more “open” 
chroma tin conformation [9, 238]. We observed that, throughout the first 24 hr of 
differentiation, chromatin of silent VSG9 , -tubulin  and GAPDH  kept the same FAIRE -
enrichment, suggesting that the chromatin remained equally condensed. Importantly, at 
BES1, although chromatin condensed slightl y (2.5 -fold at VSG2 ), it remained 12 -fold more 
open than a silent VSG. 58

from FAIRE was quantified by qPCR and normalized to 18S as its transcript levels also remained

Statistical significance was determined by 1 -way ANOVA with Bonferroni post -test comparison. *: 
p < 0.05;  **: p < 0.01; ***: p < 0.001.  
 
These results show that, during differentiation, the drop in mRNA levels of the 
active BES starts earlier and it is more pronounced than the condensation of chromatin 
(Figure 8D), suggesting that chromatin does not close immediately after transcription is 
halted.  
59 
 Transcription and chromatin dynamics during BES switching  
Next we hypothesized that, during BES switching, chromatin condensation may 
also be delayed relative to transcription silencing. We postulated that, if open chromatin 
of the active BES was exclusively the consequence of high transcription, induction of 
transcription silencing should lead to an immediate condensation of chromatin. To test 
this hypothesis, we used a BES -inducible silencing system to block the transcription at the 
active BES and we followed transcription and chromatin dynamics. Because VSG swi tching 
happens at very low frequency, we adapted a previously established reporter strain in 
which BES1 has a tetracycline operator sequence at the promoter followed by a GFP 
reporter [12]. When tetracycline is removed from the culture medium, the heterologous 
Tetracycline repressor is free and binds to the Tetracycline operator, thus sterical ly 
blocking Pol I transcription. We introduced a luciferase  gene downstream of the GFP gene 
since this is a more sensitive transcriptional reporter ( Figure 9A). This cell -line was named 
GLB1, for GFP, luciferase  and BSR in BES 1. 
During the first 8 hr after  tetracycline was removed from the medium (Tet -), GLB1 
cells grew at the same rate as the control (Tet+), after which cell growth lagged until 48 -
72 hr ( Figure 9B). This lag phase was characterized by abnormal cell morphology and 
motility (data not shown) and cell -cycle arrest in G 2/M, with a considerable accumulation 
of cells with polyploidy or abnormal DNA content ( Figure 9C). Quantification of cell death 
using propidium iodide, which only stains dead cells or in late apoptosis [375] (Figure 10 ), 
showed a significant number of stained cells from 24 to 72 hr after tetracycline removal, 
reaching a peak of 7.5% at 48 hr. Cons istent with this significant number of dead cells for 
several days, clonogenic assay confirmed that only 8% of the initial population of cells 
survive the silencing assay ( Figure 9D). After 96 hr, surviving cells took over the culture 
and grew at normal ra te of around 8 hr per population doubling. As expected, all surviving 
clones no longer expressed GFP, indicating they had successfully switched to a new VSG 
(Figure 9E).  60

hr (right panel ) after tetracycline removal.  
 
To test the efficiency of the steric blockade of Pol I upon tetracycline removal, we 
checked whether Pol I was evicted fro m BES1 chromatin fiber by conducting ChIP against 
the RPA31 subunit of Pol I ( Figure 11 ). 61 
  
Figure 10 - Cell death during BES silencing assay. BES silencing was induced and cells were 
collected 8, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hr later. Induced cells were incubated with 5 μg/ml of  propidium 
iodide (PI) prior to FACS analysis. Dead cells or in late apoptosis are stained by propidium iodide. 
The number of PI p ositive  cells in ‘Tet –‘ culture was normalized to the number of PI positive cells 
in ‘Tet+’ culture. Four independent experiments were analyzed. Statistical significance was 
determined by a t -test against a hypothetical mean value of 0, corresponding to no  cell death. 
***: p < 0.001.  
 
As expected, before BES silencing, Pol I was present in the 18S rDNA gene and in 
the active BES genes ( Luciferase  and VSG2 ) and essentially absent from Pol II loci ( -
tubulin  and GAPDH) . 8 hr after BES silencing (tetracycline removal), the levels of Pol I in 
the active BES decreased to similar background levels detected in the silent VSG9,  -
tubulin  and GAPDH . Hence, Pol I is indeed efficiently removed from chromatin fiber upon 
BES silencing.  
 
Figure 11 - A Pol I is absent from active BES 8 hr after inducing BES silencing.  RNA Pol I 
occupancy was determines by RPA31 subunit ChIP at 0 and 8 hr after tetracycline removal. 
Immunoprecipitated DNA was  compared to the total input material. Five independent 
62 
 experiments were analyzed. Statistical significance was determined by a paired t -test against 
time -point 0 hr. *:p < 0.05; **: p < 0.01.  
 
 To characterize the dynamic of chromatin structure once transcription is halted, 
we focused on the first 8 hr because this is the period in which cells grow well and 
present a normal morphology (Figure 9B and 10 ). As a proxy of transcription, we followed 
luciferase activity 2, 5 and 8 hr after removing tetracycline (Figure 12A). Luciferase activity 
showed an exponential decrease to ~20% of the initial activity at 5 hr and to only 5% 8 hr 
after tetracycline removal. Luciferase activity was confirmed by quantify ing mRNA 
transcript levels 8 hr after inducing BES silencing (Figure 12B). 18S rDNA and -tubulin  did 
not suffer transcriptional changes, confirming that BES silencing only affected expression 
sites and it did not cause any other major indirect changes in the rest of the genome. 
Luciferase  and BSR transcripts decreased 90% of the initial levels, while  active VSG2  
decreased less (32%) probably due to its stability (half -life around 4.5 hr) [373]. 
Concomitantly, we observed a 4 -8 fold transcriptional up -regula tion of several silent 
VSGs, which is likely a result from either newly activated BESs or derepressed silent BESs.  
To determine the chromatin structure of the inducibly silenced BES, we performed 
FAIRE (Figure 12C) and histone H3 chromatin immunoprecipita tion (ChIP) (Figure 12D). By 
FAIRE, we observed that, both at 5 hr and 8 hr after BES silencing, the chromatin at  the 
active BES remained highly enriched in the aqueous phase, indicating an open 
conformation. During this period, FAIRE -enrichment of silent BESs ( VSG9  and VSG13  
genes) remained unchanged. Although at 8 hr the chromatin of the active VSG2  
presented a 2 -fold decrease in FAIRE -enrichment, it was still 123 -fold higher than FAIRE -
enrichment of the same gene six days post -silencing, when this expression site was 
completely silenced. Six days post -silencing, genes from previously silent BESs ( VSG9 and 
VSG13 ) showed an increase of three -fold in FAIRE enrichment. This increase was expected 
not to be maximal (up to around 100) because FAIRE was performed on a mixed 
population of switchers. As expected, 18S rDNA and -tubulin  did not show major 
chrom atin alterations at any time. These results were mirrored by histone H3 ChIP: at 8 
hr, chromatin of originally active BES1 ( BSR and VSG2 ) was still heavily depleted of 
histone H3, which is consistent with a high FAIRE -enrichment. VSG2  had slightly more 63 
 histone H3, but the levels were still much lower than those detected at silent VSG9  or 
VSG13 . As expected for a healthy parasite population, ChIP of other control genes was 
not affected during the first 8 hr post -silencing induction, including at the 18S rDNA .

64 
 Overall, our results show that, during V SG switching, chromatin condensation lags 
significantly behind transcriptional silencing, suggesting that T. brucei  has a mechanism of 
maintaining chromatin open when transcription has been halted.  
Chromatin conformation is cell -cycle independent  
 In yeas t, the ratio between open and closed rDNA genes changes throughout the 
cell-cycle: entrance into S phase leads to repression of most rDNA genes and their 
chromatin becomes more compact, while transcription re -initiation in G 2 re-opens 
chromatin [221]. As BESs are transcribed by Pol I, we hypothesized that chromatin of 
active BES may also close as a function of the cell -cycle. To test this hypothesis, we 
stained GLB1 fixed cells with FxCycle Violet DNA stain and we FACS -sorted them, 
according to the DNA content, into G 1, S and G 2/M subpopulations (Figure 13A). The 
chromatin conformation of these subpopulations was subsequently assessed by FAIRE 
(Figure 13B).  
 
Figure 13 - Chromatin conformation of BESs is cel l-cycle independent. (A)  Nuclear DNA of GLB1 
cells was stained by FxCycle Violet and sorted by flow cytometry in G 1 (red), S (orange) and G 2/M 
(blue) cell -cycle stages. Panel in grey represents original population, colored panels represent 
analysis of post -sorted populations. (B) Chromatin conformation of the three cell -cycle 
populations was measured by FAIRE. DNA isolated by FAIRE was quantified by qPCR and 
normalized to gDNA copy number and GAPDH . Three independent experiments were analyzed. 
Statistical significance was determined by a 1 -way ANOVA with Bonferroni post -test comparison.  
 
65 
 The first observation was that the FAIRE -enrichment of sorted subpopulations 
revealed patterns very similar to unsorted cells ( BSR, luciferase  and 18S rDNA 50 -100; 
VSG9 , -tubulin  and GAPDH  around 1 ) (Figure 12C), suggesting that the sorting procedure 
did not affect chromatin conformation of these genomic  loci. Second, for each gene, the 
FAIRE -enrichment was constant overall for the three stages of the cell -cycle, suggesting  
that chromatin conformation is essentially insensitive to cell -cycle. We cannot exclude the 
possibility that very rapid and transient chromatin changes in conformation take place, 
which could not be captured at the time -resolution used here.  
Unlike rDNA g enes in yeast, we observed no major changes in the chromatin 
conformation of the active BES throughout the cell -cycle, which suggests that the 
mechanism that keeps BES chromatin open in the absence of transcription open is very 
likely cell -cycle independen t. 
TDP1 maintains chromatin open in the absence of transcription  
 In budding yeast, a Pol I transcriptional restriction for four hours under G 1 arrest 
does not affect the conformation of rDNA chromatin, which is maintained by HMO1, a 
high mobility group box (HMGB) protein [221]. In. T. brucei , TDP1, a high -mobility group 
box protein, facilitates transcription of Pol I transcribe d genes [14]. Here, we tested if 
TDP1 was necessary to maintain chromatin open in the absence of Pol I transcription. For 
this, we tagged an endogenous allele of TDP1  with a TY1 epitope and we performed ChIP. 
As previously reported [14], we found TDP1 highly enriched in the active BES ( Luciferase  
and VSG2  genes) and 18S rDNA (0 hr) (Figure 14A). After 8 hr of transcriptional silencing, 
the chromatin of the promoter -proximal region of the BES contained the same amount of 
TDP1, whereas the telomeric region had two -fold less TDP1. Nonetheless, these levels 
were still higher (7 to 9 -fold) than in silent VSGs. As TDP1 inversely correlates with histone 
H3 [14], this result is in accordance with the H3 distribution  after 8 hr of BES silencing 
(Figure 12C and 12D), and it shows that TDP1 is still largely present in the active BES when 
its transcription is reduced by at least 90% (Figure 12A). The surviving switchers (six days 
post -silencing induction) present, as exp ected, very low levels of TDP1 in the previously 
active BES.   
 66

analyzed. Statistical significance was determined by an unpaired t -test comparing Mock Tet+ and 
TDP1 KD Tet+.  (D) Ratio of FA IRE enrichment (calculated from data in panel C ) between Tet - and

 To test if TDP1 is necessary to maintain chromatin open when the active BES  is 
silenced, we depleted TDP1 by transiently transfecting an anti -TDP1 dsRNA [14]. This 
method has been previously used to knock -down -tubulin  transcripts [376]. Transfection 
with buffer (mock control), showed no changes in TDP1 levels over time (Figure 14B, and 
15A). However, transfection of anti -TDP1 dsRNA lead to a reduction of TDP1 protein 
levels to ~18% after 24 hr  and remained low until 48 hr, after which TDP1 levels increased 
(Figure 5B). Consistent with a previous report [14], we observed  that 24 hr of TDP1 
depletion resulted in a ~43% reduction of luciferase activity, confirming the role of TDP1 
as a transcriptional facilitator of the active BES ( Figure 15B ).

3, 24, 48 and 72 hr of transfection with buffer (mock) in GLB1 -TDP1::3xcMyc.  Time -point 0 hr

Quantification of  TDP1 signal is indicated in the lower panel. TDP1 protein levels were normalized 
for β-tubulin protein levels and to not transfected  cells. Four independent experiments were 
analyzed. (B) Luciferase activity was meas ured 24 hr after TDP1 depletion and compared to the 
mock control in GLB1 -TDP1::3xcMyc. Five independent experiments were analyzed.  
 
To test if TDP1 is necessary to maintain open chromatin status in the absence of 
transcription, we transfected TDP1 dsRNA or buffer into the BES inducible reporter strain 
and, after 19 hr, we transcriptionally silenced the active BES by removing tetracycli ne 
from the medium. FAIRE was used to characterize chromatin status 5 hr post -silencing 
(which corresponds to 24 hr post TDP1 depletion) in four conditions: when BES silencing 
was induced or not, and in the presence or absence of TDP1 (Figure 14C). As expe cted, 
68 
 chromatin changes were not detected for control genes: Pol II -transcribed genes, nor in 
silent VSG9 . Chromatin of 18S rDNA, although transcribed by Pol I, was not affected 
either, which is consistent with observations in yeast, in which H mo1-null mut ants do not 
lead to condensation of rDNA chromatin [221]. Relative to non -transfected control, mock 
control cells did not display changes in chromatin in any loci, including BES1, indicating 
that transfection per se  did not significantly affect chromatin conformation (Figure 14C).  
When TDP1 was depleted but BES1 remained active (TDP1 KD, Tet+), chromatin 
remained open in the promoter region and began to close at the telomere ( VSG2  is 2,6 -
fold more closed than mock transfection), which is consistent with the observations of 
Narayanan et al . upon depletion of TDP1 by RNA interference [14]. However, when TDP1 
was depleted and BES1 was silenced (TDP1 KD, Tet -), chromatin of VSG2  closed even 
further and chromatin of luciferase  also closed slightly (Figure 14C). Next we compared 
the change of FAIRE -enrichment after and before silencing was induced (Tet - versus 
Tet+), in both conditions: mock transfection (presence of TDP1) and upon TDP1 knock -
down (Figure 14D). For most genes in both conditions, this fold -chan ge of FAIRE -
enrichment is around 1, indicating that chromatin  after 5 hr of silencing is not 
dramatically different and absence of TDP1 does not cause global changes in chromatin 
during this period. However, in the VSG2  gene we detected a significant reduc tion in the 
fold-change of FAIRE -enrichment between mock and TDP1 depleted conditions. These 
results indicate that TDP1 is necessary to keep an open chromatin conformation when 
transcription of BES is halted.  
We conclude that TDP1 is a key player of the c hromatin of active BES, especially at 
the telomeric end. Narayanan et al . has previously shown that TDP1 maintains chromatin 
nucleosome -depleted and facilitates transcription. Here we show that TDP1 is crucial to 
keep an open chromatin in a BES that has be en recently silenced (especially  at the 
telomeric end of BES).  
BES probing precedes commitment to switching  
Next we investigated the advantages of having a mechanism that keeps chromatin 
open when transcription has been silenced. We hypothesized that thi s may be a 
mechanism that allows parasites to probe different silent BESs before committing to a 69 
 new BES. To test this hypothesis, first, we determined how long cells take to commit to a 
second BES. For that, we repeated the BES silencing assay but we re -added tetracycline to 
the cells 8, 24 or 48 hr post -silencing. Tetracycline relieves the transcriptional block of Tet 
repressor protein and thus allows cells that re -activate BES1 to survive (Figure 16A). Cells 
were cloned by limiting dilution and GFP -inten sity of each clone was measured  by FACS. 
GFP-positive clones indicate that cells re -activated BES1, while GFP -negative clones 
indicate cells that switched to a new BES. We observed that, none of the wells were GFP -
negative at 8 hr, suggesting that all surv iving cells could potentially reactivate BES1. 
Instead, adding tetracycline at 24 hr resulted in 49% of clones no longer expressing GFP, 
while at 48 hr this number was 96%. These results show that most surviving cells are 
already committed to a new BES two  days after silencing was induced. These results also 
show that during the first 8 hr of switching, most cells are not committed to a VSG switch 
and can revert to transcribe the original BES.  
We postulated that if commitment of most cells happens between 8 and 48 h, 
during this period we may be able to detect cells transiently probing new BESs at 
intermediate levels. Such cells were detected by Chaves et al . [348]. To test if 
transcription of silent BESs increases before commitment, we constructed another 
reporter strain, GLB1 -R3, in which an RFP::NPT fusion gene was inserte d downstream of 
the silent BES 3 in GLB1 cell -line (Figure 16B). This reporter allowed us to test at single -cell 
level whether silent BES 3 was being transiently more transcribed during switching (Figure 
16C-D). Before silencing was induced, a small number o f cells (1 -2 %) expressed low levels 
of RFP (11 -14-fold higher intensity than background levels), consistent with previous 
studies showing that silent BES are transcribed at low rate [282, 283]. 12 hr after silencing 
was ind uced, we observed an increase in the proportion of total cells expressing RFP (2 -
3%), suggesting that more cells are transcribing BES 3. The number of cells probing BES 3 
increased with time up until 36 - 48 hr, in which around 20% of the cells showed elevat ed 
levels of RFP (Figure 16D).  70

committed to switching. (A)  Commitment assay. 8, 24 or 48 hr after inducing BES silencing, 
tetracycline was added back to the medium and cells were cloned. Six days later FACS was used to

total individual wells was analyzed for each time -point between five individual experiments. (B)

(D) Proportion of probing cells was assessed by measuring number of cells expressing RFP at 
intermediate levels and still present  high levels of GFP (black line, left Y axis); switchers were 
defined as GFP -negative cells and either RFP - or RFP+ (blue and orange lines, respectively, right Y 
axis) after tetracycline removal. Three independent experiments were analyzed. Circled 1,2 and  3 
labels indicate the sorted populations described in  Figure 17. (E) Left panel  - Representative 
example of a FACS plot at 24 hr post -BES silencing showing VSG13 and GFP expression. Right 71 
 panel  - Representative example of a FACS plot showing VSG13 and RFP  expression in the cells 
present on the top right gate in left panel . Four independent experiments were analyzed.  
 
At 36 hr, two new and distinct GFP -negative populations were detected: one 
expressed high levels of RFP (0,7%) (~200 -fold higher intensity th an RFP background 
levels) and the other was RFP -negative (14,5%), suggesting that these cells are switchers 
that silenced BES1 and activated BES 3 (red curve) or another BES (blue curve), 
respectively (Figure 16D). In this mixed population of cells, the switcher subpopulations 
became more predominant with time, while the number of cells probing silent BES 3 
gradually decreased. At 96 hr, switchers were almost the sole populations in culture 
(around 5% expressed RFP and 92% did not).  
Is probing restricted to the promoter region or does it span an entire BES? To 
understand this , we used an anti -VSG13 antibody to test if we could detect VSG13 (from 
BES17) at the cell surface of silencing -induced cells. Silencing was induced in GLB1 -R3 
and, at 24 hr, cells wer e stained with anti -VSG13 (BES17) and analyzed by FACS (Figure 
16E). We observed that ~5% of cells that expressed GFP also expressed heterogeneous 
levels of  VSG13. Of these, ~20% simultaneously expressed intermediate levels of RFP and 
VSG13, indicating tha t cells can simultaneously probe two BESs, BES 3 (RFP) and BES17 
(VSG13). These results also show that probing is not restricted to the promoter region 
and, at least in some cells, the entire BES is upregulated all the way until the telomeric 
end of BES17.  
Taken together, we conclude that parasites transiently increase the transcription 
levels of silent BESs for around two days, when commitment to a new BES is almost 
complete; probing spans the entire BES, until the VSG gene and, albeit at a low frequency, 
two BESs can be simultaneous ly probed in individual cells.  
BES probing is a reversible intermediate switching step  
Next we investigated whether cells that partially upregulated RFP (probing BES 3) 
are true switching intermediates. We chose to characterize  the 24 hr time -point because 
its FACS profile is less heterogeneous (Figure 16C) and there are fewer dead cells ( Figure 
10). We induced BES silencing for 24 hr, FACS -sorted GFP+/RFP+ cells, and placed them in 72 
 culture in limiting dilutions in the presence or absence of tetracycline (Population 1, 
indicated in 24 hr FACS plot Figure 16C). We also FACS -sorted and plated GFP+/RFP - cells 
(Population 2) because, although BES 3 was not upregulated, other BESs may be 
upregulated. As a control, a population of cells  in which silencing was not induced 
(Population 3) was also sorted (Figure 17A). Cell s that attempt to reactivate BES1 die in 
the absence of tetracycline and survive in the presence of this drug. Therefore, the 
number of surviving clones six days after sor ting reflects the efficiency of BES switching of 
each sorted population at 24 hr post -silencing. Overall, in the absence of tetracycline, 3 -
5% of the clones survived the silencing assay, which is consistent with 8% of surviving 
clones measured in the clono genic assay of the whole population (Figure 9D) and 
confirms that, with this inducible system, although we can dramatically increase the 
switching frequency from around 1 in a million cells to 1 in 10 cells, 9 in 10 cells still fail to 
switch to a new BES,  even in the populations 1 and 2. When tetracycline was added to the 
culture medium after sorting, the number of surviving clones doubled (7 -9%), which was 
expected because at 24 hr half of the population is still capable of returning to the 
originally act ive BES1 (Figure 16A). 
Seven days post BES silencing, surviving clones were characterized by FACS for 
their expression of GFP and RFP, which we used as reporter of BES activity: GFP+/RFP - 
profile indicates clones that probably did not switch and reactivate d BES1; GFP -/RFP+ 
indicates switchers to BES 3; and GFP -/RFP - indicates switchers to another BES. No clones 
were obtained that simultaneously expressed GFP and RFP. For both populations 1 and 2, 
all post -sorting clones obtained in the absence of tetracyclin e no longer expressed GFP 
and thus represent switchers. Interestingly, from population 1, 57% (12 clones on average 
of three experiments) of switchers expressed RFP, while 43% (9 clones) didn’t, indicating 
that cells can probe one BES at 24 hr post -silenci ng and eventually switch to another BES 
(Figure 17B). From population 2, all switcher clones were RFP -negative (13 clones), 
indicating that switchers activated a BES other than BES 3 (Figure 17B). These results 
suggest that if a BES is not probed at 24 hr, apparently it is not fully activated later.

(indicated in Figure 16C) were sorted and plated by limiting dilution. Population 1 consists of cells 
that express GFP and RFP, while population 2 consists of cells that express GFP, but not RFP. As 
control, a third population of GFP+/RFP - cells was sorted from a culture kept und er tetracycline 
pressure. Clones obtained after six days were characterized in terms of expression of GFP and RFP 
by FACS. (B) GFP and RFP expression of surviving clones was assessed by FACS. Numbers in white

When sorted populations were plated in the presence of tetracycline we obtained 
some clones that expressed GFP and not RFP, as expected and consistent with the fact 
that at 24 hr there are still many cells that are not committed for switching and reactivate 
BES1 (Figure 17A). Post -sorting clones from population 1 showed similar proportions of 
74 
 the three different types of GFP/RFP expression profiles, indicating a large plastici ty of 
this population before commitment (Figure 17B). In contrast, most post -sorting clones 
from population 2 reactivated BES1 (77%, 24  clones) and none activated BES3  (Figure 
17B), suggesting once again that if a BES is not probed at 24 hr, it seems not t o be 
activated later. Clones obtained after sorting population 3, in which silencing was never 
induced, resulted as expected in 100% of clones expressing GFP and not RFP (Figure 17B), 
consistent with BES1 remaining active. This shows that the stress associated  with sorting 
did not induce any unexpected changes in BES expression.  
Taken together, our results indicate that cells in a probing state are not a dead end 
product resulting from the silencing inducible system used in this work. Importantly, 
these data show that probing cells can revert to the original BES1, or switch and commit 
to the probed BES, or switch and commit to another BES. Probing is therefore a reversible 
step during BES switching, allowing cells to reactivate the originally active BE S or activate 
previously silent BESs.  
Given that at 24 hr, the population consists mainly of cells capable of switching or 
reverting to original BES (with only around 3% of dead cells, Figure 10 ), we decided to 
check whether chromatin of the originally act ive BES1 remains accessible during this 
period in this cell -line (GLB1 -R3). For this, silencing was induced and cells were collected 
for FAIRE at 0 and 24 hr post -silencing (Figure 17C). At 24 hr, chromatin in VSG2  became 
significantly more compact than at  0 hr, which is consistent with the trend previously 
observed by FAIRE in GLB1 cell -line at 8 hr (Figure 12C), but the conformation is still 25 -
fold more open than that of a silent VSG9 . Consistent with probing phenotype, we 
detected a significant increase  in chromatin accessibility of the RFP::NPT  gene. All other 
tested genes showed a slight increase in accessibility, which may be due to the fact that, 
at 24 hr, the culture has some cells arrested in G 2/M or with an abnormal DNA content 
(Figure 9C), or alr eady dead ( Figure 10 ). 
 Taken together, our data reveal a novel association between the alterations of 
chromatin structure at the active BES and BES switching. Chromatin is kept essentially 
open for at least 24 hr, while silent BESs are reversibly probed b efore committing to a 
new BES.  75 
 DISCUSSION  
In this study, we showed that the chromatin structure of the active BES is cell -
cycle independent and TDP1 keeps its open conformation when transcription is halted, 
especially in the telomeric region. We propose t hat these properties are critical for the 
dynamics of switching between BESs because it gives time for cells to reversibly probe 
multiple silent BESs before committing to a new BES.  
Transcription and chromatin dynamics in the active BES  
The initial trigger that leads to VSG switching remains a mystery. However, several 
studies in which transcription of the active BES was somewhat interrupted or diminished, 
either due to loss of the VSG upstream sequence (CTR) [364] or replacement of a BES 
promoter by the T7 promoter [289], resulted in more frequent in situ  switching, 
suggesting one of the earliest events during VSG switching is the silencing of the active 
BES. In this work, we first checked if halting transcription is also one of the earliest steps 
during differentiation from bloodstream to procyclic forms,  a process in which the active 
BES needs to be silenced while procyclin genes are upregulated. We show that, 24 hr 
after inducing differentiation, transcription of the active BES is highly reduced to 2% 
(Figure 8B), while the chromatin of this locus remain s essentially open (Figure 8C). We 
conclude that during differentiation, transcription silencing precedes chromatin changes, 
and thus it is likely that a similar mechanism happens during VSG switching in 
bloodstream forms.  
In the tetracycline -inducible sys tem developed by the Horn lab, when the Tet 
repressor binds the Tet operator, it sterically blocks Pol I transcription, which results in 
silencing of the initially active BES and activation of a new one (Figure 9). In this work, we 
confirmed that inducible  BES silencing promotes a rapid decrease in  transcript levels of 
genes from initially active BES (at least 90% drop in the first 8 hr, as accessed by transcript 
levels of the unstable luciferase  reporter) and an eviction of Pol I from chromatin fiber, 
whic h confirms that transcription of active BES is efficiently and rapidly stopped (Figure  
11, 12A and 12B). During this period, chromatin remained in an open state despite 
transcription being halted (Figure 12C and 12D). By ChIP , we observed a slight enrichme nt 76 
 of histone H3 in the VSG2  gene and a decrease in TDP1, suggesting a more compact 
chromatin mainly at the telomeric end of BES.  
Our study also shows that chromatin conformation of the active BES is cell -cycle 
independent. Using FAIRE, we detected no sig nificant differences in chromatin 
conformation of active BES in cells in G 1, S and G 2/M. Given that, when parasites divide, 
most daughter cells use the “mother’s” BES and only very few switch to a new BES, it is 
tempting to speculate that keeping an open c hromatin structure serves as an epigenetic 
marker that, after cell division, signals which BES should be used by the daughter cells. 
Perhaps TDP1 interacts with the cohesion complex, which is necessary after S phase to 
maintain the two sister chromatids of  the active BES associated to the single Expression 
Site Body while waiting for chromosome segregation during mitosis [265]. This hypothesis 
deserves furth er investigation in the future.  
TDP1 maintains open  chromatin when BES has been silenced  
High -mobility group box (HMGB) proteins are essential nuclear components in 
chromatin structure, transcriptional activity and DNA damage repair [300-302]. In yeast, 
Hmo1 is a HMGB protein that is associated with Pol I transcription machinery [308], which 
can competitively displace histone H1 [295] and also maintain chromatin in an open 
conformation [221]. In T. brucei , TDP1 is an essential HMGB protein that is highly 
enriched in Pol I loci [13, 14]. Like yeast H mo1, TDP1 is a facilitator of Pol I transcription 
and it is necessary to keep chromatin nucleosome -depleted in a steady -state situation. 
Here we show that when BES silencing was induced in the absence of TDP1, chromatin 
became significantly more compact, indicating that TDP1 is necessary to maintain an 
open chromatin structure in the absence of transcription. This ro le is consistent with what 
has been observed in yeast, in which H mo1 maintains Pol I chromatin open when 
transcription is halted [221].  
In eukaryotes, deposition of canonical histones is normally replication -dependent 
[377]. Although our data shows that maintenance of BES chromatin structure is cell -cycle 
independent (Figure 13), we predict that during the rare event of VSG switching, 
chromatin remodelling occurs in S phase of the cell -cycle. Thus, during replication, 
eviction of TDP1 from a silencing BES may be an important step to complete a BES 77 
 switching. Regulating the timin g of TDP1 eviction may be a means to determine for how 
long a cell stays in a “probing” stage, before commitment.  
It is interesting to observe that, in two  different circumstances (BES transcriptional 
silencing in wild -type or TDP1 depleted conditions),  the chromatin of the BES telomeric 
end is more rapidly closed than chromatin close to the BES promoter (which can be up to 
50 kb upstream from telomere). Telomeres possess a highly controlled chromatin 
structure and, in trypanosomes, they are very importa nt for antigenic variation [378]. It is 
possible that, upon transcriptional silencing, loading of nucleosomes onto chromatin 
happens faster at the telomeric region. Tiengwe et al . found tha t although most origins of 
replication are found in core regions of the chromosome, VSG genes also harbor origins of 
replication, which could drive inward replication and deposition of nucleosomes [268]. 
Spreading of such chromatin condensation may happen evenly towards the BES promoter 
or it may happen in steps if the BES has insulator elements, such as the 70 -bp repeat 
array for example, which could prevent spreading of nucleosome lo adin g into the 
upstream ESAGs.  
Probing and commitment to a new BES  
Chaves and colleagues proposed that, during a switching event, a cell pre -activates 
a silent BES before a natural intermediate rapidly and transiently express two VSGs and 
ultimately commits for switching or reverts to the original BES [348]. A more recent study, 
in which BES transcriptional attenuation was observed as a consequence of ectopically 
overexpressing a silent VSG, also proposed that this attenuation could give time for 
parasites to probe silent BES before switching to a fu lly competent BES [368]. The nature 
of what cells are probing is unknown. It is possible that cells are testing the order of VSG 
switching, or if ESAGs are functional, or if previously untested or mosaic VSGs are 
functio nal. Our results are in agreement with these models of “probing before decision” 
and we propose that regulation of chromatin structure may be the underlying epigenetic 
mechanism. We show here that trypanosomes test silent BES before a choice is made and 
this is associated to keeping chromatin of the active BES open ( Figure 18).  78 
  
Figure 18 - Model for VSG expression site switching: transcriptional probing silent BESs before 
commitment is associated to a temporary maintenance of ope n chromatin by TDP1.  Chromatin 
of the actively transcribed BES possesses an open chromatin enriched in TDP1. Upon 
transcriptional silencing of the active BES, cells undergo an intermediate state characterized by 
stabilization of the active BES open chroma tin by TDP1 while probing silent BESs. Commitment to 
switch or not switch seems to take around two days. This decision can either be returning to the 
initial active BES (which, in our reporter cell -line, because BES1 is blocked by TetR, it would result 
in cell death) or switching to a new BES. In this later case, the chromatin of the originally active 
BES loses TDP1 and becomes nucleosome -enriched.  
 
Our commitment assay showed that, 8 hr after silencing, no cells are committed to 
switching although silent VSG transcripts are already detected (Figure 12B). Half of the 
cells are committed 24 hr post -silencing, while most of them are committed at 48 hr. 
From 12 -48 hr, more c ells probe silent BESs, but only a fraction of the cells expresses 
higher levels of RFP, which indicates that not all BESs are being probed at the same time 
in each cell. Nevertheless, we found that at least two BESs can be probed simultaneously 
by the sam e cell (Figure 16E). At 24 hr, a small fraction of cells becomes GFP -negative, 
consistent with committed switching and this population  becomes more predominant 
with time. These results show that probing of one or more BESs is a reversible process 
that last s around two days, during which cells either switch to the probed BES, switch to a 
different BES or revert to BES1. Reverting to original BES1 is probably facilitated by the 
fact that BES1 retains an open chromatin structure for at least 24 hr (Figure 17C). 
In some aspects, our model resembles the formation of poised chromatin. Poised 
chromatin at Pol II transcribed genes is characterized by the presence of bivalent marks; 
the co -existence of activating and repressive histone marks within the same domains 
79 
 [379]. This epigenetic status has been associated to genes that are transcribed at low 
levels but need to be in a prepared state for developmental fates of rapid activation or 
repression, such as differentiation of embryonic stem cells or activation of T -cells [380, 
381]. A poised chromatin state has also been found at var genes in Plasmodium 
falciparum , the causative agent of malaria. Switching between var genes i s essential for 
antigenic variation [346]. It is possible that T. brucei  uses a TDP1 -dependent mechanism 
as a means of temporarily keeping the active BES in a poised state, ready for being 
activated or repressed. In the future, it will be interesting to test whether this mechanism 
of keeping chro matin temporarily open also facilitates VSG switching by recombination. In 
lymphocytes, for example, it has been already shown that the chromatin that is accessible 
for V(D)J recombination typically displays elevated acetylation of histones H3 and H4, 
whic h is a hallmark of a more accessible chromatin [382]. 
In this study we showed that the chromatin structure is kept open by TDP1 
probably to facilitate probing, before cells commit to a new BES. It is intriguing that, 
during differentiation, chromatin of the original ly active BES is also hold open for some 
time while transcription has already been reduced. This suggests that differentiating cells 
may also undergo an intermediate stage, which may be reversible. This is consistent with 
findings by Batram et al ., in whic h attenuation of the active BES results in an intermediate 
stage that can reversibly progress in two directions: differentiation to procyclic or 
returning to proliferation in the mammalian form. The implications of chromatin 
dynamics in differentiation sho uld be further investigated, and preferably in a 
pleomorphic strain, whose differentiation process is more similar to what happens in vivo .

 INTRODUCTION  
High Mobility Group box (HMGB) proteins are characterized by their small size, 
rapid mobility and by containing at least one high mobility group box domain, responsible 
for DNA binding [293, 294]. HMGB proteins have been reported to fulfill several 
important roles that range from extracellular mediator of inflammatory responses, 
angiogenesis or wound repair [297-299], to nuclear regulator of essential processes such 
as transcription, replication, DNA repair or V(D)J recombination [300-303]. The HMG -box 
domain is able to bind to bent, kinked or unwounded DNA structures in order to bend, 
distort or loop DNA in either a sequence or non -sequence specificity [295]. 
HMGB proteins were shown to influence transcription by three different 
mechanisms: they facilitate nucleosome sliding by chromatin remodeling proteins [304, 
305], they serve as a transient chaperone for stable binding of transcription factors [306] 
or they participate in transcription blockage as part of a complex that inhibits the 
assembly of a preinitiation complex on promoters [307]. HMGB proteins also participate 
in the regulation of ribosomal DNA ( rDNA) genes, which are transcribed by  RNA 
polymerase I (Pol I). Upstream binding factor (UBF) in mammals and Hmo1 in yeast are 
two HMGB proteins important for the chromatin structure and transcription of r DNA loci 
[308, 383]. Both UBF and Hmo1 bind throughout the r DNA actively transcribed genes 
[313, 322], while only UBF binds  to the r DNA promoter as part of the preinitiation 
complex (PIC)  [383]. In yeast, a similar role i s fulfilled  by upstream -associated factor (UAF)  
in the promoter  [173]. Nonetheless, UBF and Hmo1 are importan t to establish and 
maintain open chromatin conformation in Pol I loci [166]. 
During the life cycle of  T. brucei , parasites shift between the mammalian host and 
the Tsetse fly [286]. To survive in such different hosts, parasites undergo significant 
changes in gene expression, which include replacement of the VSG by the similarly 
abundant procyclins [287] and then to metacyclic VSGs before injection back to the 
mammal [33]. Both bloodstream and metacyclic VSG genes are transcribed from 
subtelomeric loci called Bloodstream and Metacyclic Expression Sites (BESs and MESs), 
respectively. BES s are polycistronic units with a variable number of expression -site-
associated  genes (ESAGs), whereas MES are transcribed monocistronically [93, 98, 384]. 
On the other hand, procyclin genes are located in the internal part of chromosomes 84 
 distributed among two loci [271]. Strikingly, both VSGs and procyclins coding genes are 
transcribed by Pol I [4, 366]. Although the T. brucei  genome has more than 2000 VSG 
genes and pseudo genes [91], in bloodstream f orms only one VSG is transcribed from one 
of the approximately 15 BESs present in the genome at a specific time. This ensures the 
VSG monoallelic expression, one of the hallmarks of antigenic variation.  
While in the mammalian -infective bloodstream forms ( BSF), the chromatin of the 
active and silent BESs is dramatically different. The actively transcribed BES is 
nucleosome -depleted (open state), while silent BESs are organized in regularly spaced 
nucleosomes [9, 10]. Procyclin loci possess a more open chromatin structure than silent 
BESs, since procyclin gene s are transcribed in BSF s but down -regulated  post -
transcriptionally, whereas MES s chromatin structure is completely closed  [238]. Besides 
the multi -subunit class I transcription factor A (CITFA) , which binds only to active BES 
promoters and is necessary to regulate BES transcription initiation [233], only TDP1 has 
been shown to be a core structural component of the active BES [14]. TDP1, one of the 
few HMGB gene s in the T. brucei genome  and so far the only identified nuclear HMGB 
prote in, is highly enriched in Pol I actively transcribed regions, namely the active BES and 
rDNA genes [14]. TDP1 depletio n results in a striking growth arrest, chromatin repression 
and VSG transcriptional downregulation. We have shown  in the previous chapter  that 
TDP1 is important to maintain open chromatin structure in the active BES after inducing a 
transcriptional silencing. This functional role allows the probing of silent BES before 
commitment for switching to a new BES or returning to the initial BES is  undertaken, 
demonstrating an impact of TDP1 in antigenic variation.  
In this chapter, we characterized the phenotype of a TDP1 gain -of-function 
mutant. We found that upon TDP1 overexpression, growth rate was slightly reduced but 
chromatin of silent BES , ME S and procyclin loci  became decondensed leading to 
transcriptional derepression of these loci. Moreover, monoallelic expression becomes 
disrupted  as expression of a silent VSG was observed. Although these results  are still 
preliminary and require further e xperiments before publication, we show that  the tight 
control of TDP1 expression is important for monoallelic VSG expression.   85 
 MATERIALS AND METHODS  
Trypanosome cell -lines and plasmid construction  
T. brucei  bloodstream form (BSF) parasites (strain Lister 4 27, antigenic type MiTat 
1.2, clone 221a) [385] were cultured in HMI -11 as described in [371]. PL1S cell -line wa s 
described in [258]. POT clones were generated b y transfecting pFAB9 in PL1S with an 
AMAXA nucleofector (Lonza), program X -001, using the previously optimized homemade 
Tb-BSF buffer ( 90 mM Na2HPO 4, 5 mM KCl, 0.15 mM CaCl2 , 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.3 ) [372]. 
pFAB9 contains two bidirectional promoters: a T7 promoter that promotes transcrip tion 
of the BLE gene to allow selection of positive clones with phelomycin and r DNA promoter 
followed by two Tet Operator sequences and a TDP1 gene with C -terminal TY1 tag and an 
aldolase 3’UTR. pFAB9 was linearized with NotI (New England Biolabs), for int egration in 
of the r DNA spacer sequences. Overexpression was induced by adding 1 g/ml of 
Tetracycline to the medium.  
All cloning was performed using the In -Fusion® HD Cloning  system (Clontech) 
following to the manufacturer’s instructions.  
Western Blotting  
Cells were lysed using Laemmli buffer, resuspended at 1 × 105 cells/l and treated 
with 200 U/ml Benzonase (Sigma). A SDS -PAGE was performed at 4ºC and proteins were 
transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using an iBlot Dry Blotting System (Invitrogen) 
for 6 min and 30 sec. Membrane was blocked with 5% milk in PBS / 0.1% Tween for at 
least 1 hour and primary mouse anti -TY1 antibody [386] and mouse anti --tubulin [387] 
were incubated overnight at 4ºC in a 1:2000 and 1:1000 dilutions, respectively, in 3% milk 
in PBS / 0.1% Tween. Membran e was washed three times with PBS / 0.1% Tween, and 
incubated with anti -mouse horseradish peroxidase -linked secondary antibody 
(Amersham) at room temperature for 1 hr in a 1:20000 dilution in 3% milk in PBS / 0.1% 
Tween. Membrane was further washed three t imes with PBS / 0.1% Tween and 
developed with a Western Lightning Plus -ECL (PerkinElmer). Film acquisition was made 
using Fuji Medical X -ray films (Fujifilm) in a Hypercassette (Amersham) in a CURIX 60 
tabletop processor low -volume radiology (AGFA).  
 86 
 FAIR E 
Formaldehyde -assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE) was performed as 
described previously [238]. 20 million cells were centrifuged for 20 min at 3000 g, 
resuspended in 20 ml of HMI -11 and crosslinked with 1.1% Formaldehyde (Sigma) for 10 
min. In cell -cycle sorted fractions, protocol was perfor med with only 1 -2 million cells. 
Crosslinking was stopped with 0.125 M of Glycine (Sigma) and cells were washed once 
with Trypanosome Dilution Buffer (TDB) ( 5 mM KCl, 80 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgSO 4, 20 mM 
Na2HPO 4, 2 mM NaH 2PO 4, 20 mM glucose, pH 7.4) . Cell pellets  were lysed with Lysis 
Buffer (50 mM TrisHCl, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS) complemented with Protease Inhibitor 
Cocktail (Sigma) and Solution P (PMSF, Pepstatin). Lysates were incubated on ice for 15 
min and an external plasmid DNA spike was added before sonicating  with 10 cycles of 30 
aliquot of the supernatant was taken to check sonication efficiency. The remaining 
fraction was subjected to two Phenol -Chloroform -Isoamyl Acid (25:24:1) (Sigma). DNA 
present in the aqueous phase, corresponding to open chromatin, was precipitated and 
washed with 2 volumes of absolute ethanol, sodium acetate 0.3 M and 20 g/ml glycogen 
overnight at -20ºC DNA was washed once with ethanol 70% and dri ed before 
resuspension in Elution Buffer (Quiagen). Samples were then treated with 100 g/ml of 
RNase A (ROTH) and purified with a PCR purification kit (Quiagen). A non -crosslinked 
sample was always included to normalize qPCR data for gene copy number. 
Quantification of the FAIRE and total DNA samples were analyzed by qPCR  with primers 
presented in Table 5 . Amplification reactions were performed in duplicates.  
Transcript quantification  
Parasites were harvested by centrifugation at 650 g  for 10 min at 4 C and 
immediately resuspended in PureZOL (Bio -Rad) or TRIzol (Life Technologies). RNA was 
isolated following the manufacturer’s instructions and RNA quantity and quality was 
assessed on a NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). cDNA was generated  from 20 0 
ng of RNA  using a Superscript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Life Technologies), according to 
manufacturer’s protocol. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using 1× SYBR Green 
PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems)  using primers presented in Table 5 . Negative 
control s lacking reverse transcriptase (RT -) were confirmed by qPCR. Amplification 87 
 reactions were performed in duplicates. The Ct method as used to determine 
transcript levels relative to normalizing gene.  
Luciferase assay  
1.5 × 106 cells were harvested for 5 m in at 2800 g, 4ºC and washed once with 1 ml 
cold TDB. Pellets were resuspended in Lysis Buffer (Biotium) and protocol was followed 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Luminescence was measured by a 
microplate reader (Tecan).  
VSG staining of live cells  
0.5 × 106 cells were harvested for 5 min at 2800 g, 4ºC. Cells were resuspended in 
50l of cold HMI -11 in which Alexa Fluor 647 anti -VSG13 conjugated antibody had been 
previously diluted (1:5000). After 15 min of incubation at 4 ºC with gentle shaking , cells 
were washed three times in cold TDB, resuspended in cold TDB, and immediately 
analyzed on a FACS Fortessa (Becton Dickinson Biosciences). Data were processed with 
FlowJo software (FlowJo, LLC).

 RESULTS  
TDP1 overexpression is well tolerated  
The high mobility group box proteins (HMGB) UBF and Hmo1 are structural 
chromatin components with an essential role in RNA Polymerase I (Pol I) elongation [308, 
324]. Overexpression of UBF1, one of the proteins that compose UBF complex, leads to 
increased levels of rDNA genes transcription [327]. On the other hand, the overexpression 
of Hmo1 causes yeast cells to enter a vegetative growth [318]. In T. brucei , TDP1 is a core 
component of Pol I -loci chromatin and its depletion leads to chromatin repression and 
transcriptional downregulation, especially in the actively transcribed bloodstream 
expression site (BES) [14, 388]. How overexpression of TDP1 can impact monoallelic VSG 
expression poses an important question for antigenic variation.  
A tetracycline -inducible system was first generated to conditionally overexpress C -
terminal TY1 -tagged TDP1 gene from the rDNA spacer locus in PL1S cell -line (Figure 1 9A) 
[258]. PL1S expresses VSG9 from BES2 and contains a luciferase  reporter gene in the 
promoter region of silent BES1. Two independent clones from this PL1S Overexpressing 
TDP1 cell -line were named POT1 and POT2. Overexpression was first confirmed in two 
POT clones by western blot after 24 and 48 hr of induction (Figure 1 9B). A control cell -line 
was used which possesses a TY1 -tag in a histone H1 gene to evaluate the functionality of 
the anti -TY1 antibody. The levels of the TY1 -tagged allele are undetectable before 
induction, indicating a tight -control of the inducible expression in both clones. At 24 hr, a 
clear band of the expected size (~32kDa) could be detected in both clones and its 
intensit y was higher at 48hr, indicating that overexpression was successful. Both clones 
show a normal growth within the first 48 hr of overexpression, after which a small 
reduction in growth is observed (Figures 1 9C and 1 9D). 90

TDP1 opens chromatin of many different loci but only silent BESs, MESs and procyclin 
loci become upregulated  
TDP1 in T. brucei  keeps chromatin of active BES open in the presence  [14] and 
absence of transcription  as observed in the previous chapter . Given that TDP1 is a 
chromatin component  the actively transcribed BES, it was  hypothesized that 
overexpression of TDP1 would lead to its loading in sites typically devoid of TDP1, such as 
silent BESs. We used FAIRE to measure the global impact in chromatin conformation 24 
and 48 hr after TDP1 ov erexpression ( Figure 2 0A and 2 0B) [9, 238, 388]. In both POT 
clones, we observed that the chro matin of silent BES became more open with a more 
91 
 dramatic change for POT1. At 48 hr, the promoter region of silent BES ( Luciferase ) opened 
~50-100 fold relative to the non -induced condition, whereas the correspondent VSG in 
the same silent BES ( VSG2 ) becam e only 4 -9 fold more open when compared to non -
induced cells, indicating silent BESs are not fully derepressed.  Interestingly, silent VSG13  
was more derepressed (21 -33 fold more open) than VSG2 , suggesting differential 
regulation between the silent BES upo n overexpression induction.  Also, not only the 
procyclin loci ( GPEET2 ) chromatin become 5 -8 fold more open as the highly regulated and 
silent MES ( mVSG639 ) become derepressed to some extent (4 -5 fold more open).  
Chromatin of genes from the active BES ( BSR and VSG9 ) and rDNA ( 18S) remained 
unchanged, suggesting that these loci are fully loaded with TDP1. It was  also detected a 
slight  but significant  increase in the chromatin accessibility  in -tubulin (~5-fold), a Pol II 
transcribed gene, a situation which is similar in GAPDH  although not with statistical 
significance.   This suggest s a slight promiscuous DNA binding of TDP1 , but it  is not 
unexpected as TDP1 was detected in Pol II and Pol III transcribed genes notwithstanding 
low levels [14]. 
Can this increase in chromatin accessibility in silent BES lead to  higher levels of 
transcription ? To answer this question,  the transcript levels of several genes were 
measured 24 and 48 hr after inducing TDP1 overexpression  (Figure 2 0C and 2 0D). Once 
again, the phenotype presented by both clones is similar but more robust for POT1. 
Transcript levels of genes in silent BES s were i ncreased, although the increase was higher 
in the promoter region ( luciferase , ~70 -200 fold increase) relative to the telomeric region 
(VSG2  and VSG13 , 3-5 fold and 20 -30 fold increase respectively). These results are 
consistent with the chromatin accessib ility measured by FAIRE, i.e. those genes close to 
the BES promoter become more derepressed. Transcripts of life -cycle regulated MES 
(mVSG639 , 5-16 fold increase) and procyclin ( GPEET2 , 3-4 fold increase) genes were also 
slightly upregulated, indicating th at all Pol I low -transcribed genes were derepressed. 
Conversely, active BES ( BSR and VSG9 ) and rDNA ( 18S) genomic regions maintain their 
transcription status, which is consistent with no change in chromatin conformation 
(Figure 2 0A and 20 B). Interestingly,  transcript levels of Pol II transcribed genes ( -tubulin 
and GAPDH)  were not affected by TDP1 overexpression  (although POT2 presents a slight 92 
 significant -tubulin  downregulation) , suggesting that the slight decondensation of 
chromatin at these loci is no t sufficient to result in higher transcript levels.

Bonferroni post -test comparison. *: p < 0.05; **: p < 0.01; ***: p < 0.001.  
 
Thus, TDP1 is capable to open chromatin structure in all tested genes whose 
chromatin is organized in re gularly spaced nucleosomes, but its effect is more 
pronounced in silent BES s. Consistently, TDP1 overexpression resulted in transcriptional 
93 
 upregulation of Pol I genes but not of Pol II genes, consistent with the model that TDP1 is 
a transcriptional facili tator  of Pol I but not of Pol II.  
VSG monoallelic expression is disrupted when TDP1 is overexpressed  
VSG monoallelic expression is a hallmark of antigenic variation. Although silent 
BES derepression has been previously observed in several T. brucei  loss of function 
mutants, the expression of several VSGs at the cell surface has been detected only in a 
few cases [245, 258, 263, 264, 389]. Hence, it was  tested if the transcriptional 
upregulation in silent BESs caused by TDP1 overexpression could be detected at the 
protein level.  
First, the activity of the luciferase reporter, which is located downstream of the 
promoter of the silent BES1  was measured . Because the mRNA levels of this gene were 
highly increased (Figure 20C), it was expected its luminescence activity to be 
concomitantly higher (Figure 21A). Indeed, after  48 hr of TDP1 overexpression, the 
luciferase activity was higher in both clones and proportional to the increase at the mRNA 
levels, with POT1 displaying, as expected, a stronger phenotype. The fold -increase of 
luciferase activity is close to 300 -fold for  POT1, which is much higher than what has been 
detected in previous studies (maximum of 40 -fold in TbRAP1 knockdown cells, maximum 
of 10 -fold in histone H1 knockdown cells) [238, 258]. Although this increase is very 
significant, it is still below the levels luciferase exhibits when its gene is localized in the 
active BES, which typically are 1000 -4000 fold higher [258].   
To test th e presence of derepressed VSGs at the surface upon TDP1 
overexpression, an antibody specific for VSG13 was used [245] (Figure 21B). At 24 hr post -
induction the expression of VSG13 is not significant on either clone (0.8 -2.4%) but, at 48 
hr, 9 -24% of the cells already have intermediate levels of VSG13 (Figure 21C).

 We conclude  that overexpressing TDP1 leads to expression of more than one VSG 
at a given time, which means that monoallelic expression is compromised. To our 
knowledge, it is the first time that overexpression of a factor in T. brucei  interferes with 
monoalle lic expression . 
 
  96 
 DISCUSSION  
 It was previously shown that TDP1 is a component of the chromatin of actively 
transcribed Pol I loci, such as the active BES and r DNA repeats , and it is necessary to 
prevent deposition of nucleosomes at those loci [9, 10]. In this chapter , we describe the 
first steps in the characteriz ation of a gain -of-function mutant of TDP1  and we showed 
that when TDP1 is overexpressed, the chromatin of silent BESs, MESs and procyclin genes 
becomes more open (Figures 20A and 20B) and transcription of these loci increases 
(Figure 20C and 20D) . These results suggest that  TDP1 can displace nucleosomes from 
chromatin fibers and this is sufficient  to facilitate RNA polymerase I transcription.  
The chromatin decondensation effect observed upon TDP1 overexpression is not 
homogeneous throughout the whole length of silent BESs. By FAIRE, we observed that the 
promoter region opened ~100 -fold, while the decondensation at the corresponding VSG 
was less pronounced (around 5 -10 fold). Consistently, we observed that the increase i n 
transcript levels was higher close to the promoter than at the telomeric end of the silent 
BES (70 -190 fold vs 3 -27 fold, respectively). This suggests that more TDP1 was loaded in 
the promoter region of the silent BES chromatin than in the telomeric regi on, although 
ChIP experiments need to be conducted to show that TDP1 becomes loaded in these loci . 
One possible explanation is that chromatin in the BES promoter region is normally  more 
open than telomeric region , which has been proposed before [9, 10]. Indeed, FAIRE and 
ChIP experiments have show n that BES promoter  regions have fewer nucleosomes, which 
could facilitate the incorporation of TDP1 at these loci upon overexpression. Alternatively, 
some of the non -nucleosome components of chromatin that are enriched at the 
telomeric end of silent BESs (RAP1 and NLP) could hinder the binding of TDP1 in these 
regions  [251, 258]. It is also inter esting that the transcript fold increase upon TDP1 
overexpression for the silent VSGs is comparable to the transcript fold increase for almost 
all silent VSGs that are upregulated upon VEX1 overexpression [270]. 
It is worth noticing that the transcript fold increase for  the silent VSG is still low 
compared to the typical more than 10.000 fold increase that active VSG transcripts 
present relative to the silent VSGs (qPCR C T ~14~ -15 for active VSG9 and 29 -30 for silent 
VSG2). These results were confirmed at the protein level. By FACS, we observed that 
TDP1 overexpression results in partial expression of a “silent” VSG13  (Figure 21). These 97 
 results are reminiscent to what was o bserved in DOT1B KO [245] and shows that TDP1 is 
suffi cient to disrupt monoallelic expression. Unfortunately, due to absence of an antibody 
against VSG9, we could not test if the expression of the active VSG is maintained, as 
observed at the mRNA level. Moreover, it would be interesting to, not only try to ob serve 
expression of other silent VSGs, but also perform microscopy experiments against VSGs to 
assess that expression of silent VSG(s) occurs at the cell surface.  Why silent BESs are 
never fully derepressed in mutant cell -lines remains unknown. In this stu dy, it is possible 
that the levels of TDP1 were not high enough to displace all histones from silent BESs. But 
it is also possible that additional levels of regulation prevent a silent BES from being 
transcribed at the same levels as the active BES. For ex ample, perhaps the derepressed 
silent BESs are not transcribed from the ESB and thus lack a limiting component for full 
transcription.  Maybe overexpression of both VEX1 and TDP1 could lead to not only loss of 
the “winner takes  all” mechanism allowing silen t BES to be also transcribed (through 
VEX1) but in a more competent and efficient fashion (through TDP1) causing higher levels 
of derepression.  
Other silent Pol I transcribed loci ( procyclins and metacyclic VSGs ) also become 
derepresse d. For metacyclic VSG 639, the chromatin accessibility increased 4 -5 fold 
whereas transcript levels increased 5 -16 fold.  Metacyclic VSGs expression is regulated at 
the level of transcription [290] where its endogenous promoter is inactive in bloodstream 
forms [292], thus showing that TDP1 alone is able to drive transcription of life -cycle 
regulated surface protein genes. For GPEET2  procyclin g ene, the chromatin accessibility 
increased 5 -8 fold whereas transcript levels increased 3 -4 fold. Procyclins are around 9 -
fold less transcribed in bloodstream forms than in procyclic forms [274]. However, as 
procyclin mRNAs possess a highly unstable 3’UTR that reduces the stability of these 
transcripts [156], we cannot be certain if the transcription rate of procyclins due to TDP1 
overexpression is higher than the detected through the steady -state mRNA levels and 
compensated by post -transcriptional degradation. These results show that TDP1 loading 
is able to open chromatin and facilitate transcription of multiple Pol I transcribed regions 
[14]. The transcript levels fold in creases on both these loci are  also within the same range 
as the ones observed for several metacyclic VSG  and procyclin  genes when VEX1 is 
overexpressed [270].  98 
 Upon TDP1 overexpression, the chromatin of Pol II transcribed genes -tubulin 
and GAPDH  became more accessibl e, especially -tubulin . This  suggest s that TDP1, 
besides binding to Pol II transcribed DNA [14], may also remodel Pol II loci chromatin. In 
contrast to Pol I loci, these small alterations of chromatin c onformation in Pol II loci, did 
not result in major detectable changes of transcript levels. This is consistent with a very 
slight reduced growth rate in POT clones, indicating that excess of TDP1 is not toxic to the 
cell and that loss of monoallelic expre ssion does not compromise growth. Yeast Hmo1 
also binds to Pol II transcribed loci [312, 390], but in contrast to T. brucei  this binding 
contributes to Pol II transcription initiation [314, 315] and leads to a major growth defect 
[318]. Overexpression of TDP1 does not lead to chromatin accessibility and transcription 
changes in 18S genes . It has also been previously showed that depletion of H1 leads to 
chromatin opening of sev eral Pol I loci but not 18S [238]. Thus, these observations 
suggest that rDNA genes in T. brucei  may be all, or almost all, in an open chromatin 
conformation.  Overall, these results indicate that TDP1 shares several functional features 
with UBF (structural component and transcriptional facilitator of Pol I loci) an d Hmo1 
(structural component of both Pol I and Pol II loci) but is not a bona fide  ortholog ue of 
neither of them. It is possible that TDP1, being essential and one of the few  HMGB 
protein s in T. brucei , it fulfills several essential roles not only in transcription, but also in 
other nuclear processes described for HMGB proteins, such as replication and DNA repair.  
 Expression of only one VSG at the cell surface of T. brucei  is believed to be crucial 
to reduce the repertoire of antibodies generated by t he host immune system. Switching 
to a new VSG enables survival and maintenance of infection. Using FACS, we detected no 
switchers in POT clones, suggesting overexpression of TDP1 does not lead to a dramatic 
increase in switching frequency. However, because  procyclin and metacyclic VSGs were 
transcriptionally upregulated  at the mRNA level , these non -variant proteins might be 
exposed at the cell surface of bloodstream forms. If these proteins are present at high 
enough levels and exposed to antibody recogniti on by the host immune system, we 
would expect the virulence of POT1 clones in mice to be compromised . It is also possible 
that differentiation of parasites from slender to procyclic  forms  in this monomorphic 
strain  may also be compromised .  99 
  In the upcomin g months, we expect to have strengthened functional and 
biological data to support our hypothesis that TDP1 overexpression leads to VSG 
monoallelic disruption as a result of the deregulation of silent BES chromatin status, 
which may impact the progression of an infection in mice. Thus, we anticipate the 
preparation of a manuscript that reveals the gain -of-function phenotype of the antigenic 
variation key player TDP1.  100

 GENERAL DISCUSSION  
 Trypanosoma brucei  parasites are able to establish an infection in the mammalian 
host for several months or even years. Such persistence is dependent of antigenic 
variation. One of the mechanisms used by the parasite to exchange the VSG surface coat 
consists in transcriptio nally silence the active BES and activate a new BES [8]. The 
mechanism of VSG in situ  switching is poorly understood. The steady -state chromatin 
structure of the active and silent BES has been characterized [9, 10] and several 
chromatin -associated factors involved in the maintenance of monoallelic expression have 
been identified (reviewed in [369], updated in Table 2). However, the s equence of events 
and the key players involved in an in situ  switching were fully missing at the beginning of 
this dissertation. I studied how changes in chromatin structure and transcription are 
coordinated during in situ  switching, which led to the identification of TDP1 (trypanosome 
DNA -binding protein 1) as a critical chromatin factor in switching and monoallelic 
expression.  
 The natural trigger that drives a VSG switching event is still currently unknown. It 
is unknown if changes occur fir st in the active or if it is a silent BES that becomes 
upregulated. It is also unknown what changes first: at the level of transcription or 
chromatin structure. Due to the low switching frequency both in vivo  or in vitro  [391, 
392], it is extremely rare to observe a natural switching event, so the first question 
becomes difficult to tackle. Nonetheless, the active BES must also be shut down during an 
in situ  switching. Similarly, during the differentiation process from bloodstream forms 
(BSFs) to procyclic forms (PFs), the active BES is shut down and another set of surface 
proteins, the procyclins, is expressed [59]. When differentiation in BSFs is triggered in 
vitro , the transcript levels decrease very steeply in the first 24 hr, but the chromatin 
conformation is still essentially open indicating that transcriptional silencing precedes 
chromatin changes. Although in a different biological context, it is tempting to think that 
in an in situ  switching event the same observation could occur.  
To induce a transcriptional silencing, a cell -line containing a tetracycline inducible 
system in the active BES promoter was employed. Similarly to differentiation, when BES 
silencing was induced, we observed that the transcription was rapidly blocked and 104 
 transcript l evels were reduced  in the first 8 hr. However, the active BES chromatin 
remained open as late as 24 hr post -silencing. Other features could also be observed at 
this specific time -point: i) only a small fraction of cells had already switched to another 
VSG;  ii) half of transcriptionally silenced cells were already committed to switched 
although not completed the process; iii) cells that are not committed to switch are able to 
revert and re -initiate transcription of the active BES; iv) cells are probing silen t BESs and 
can test more than one BES at the same time; v) Silent BES probing occurs not only in the 
promoter region but is extended until the VSG gene with silent VSG protein being 
detected. All these observations allowed us to propose a model in which th e maintenance 
of the open chromatin in the active BES upon transcriptional silencing is important to 
allow parasites to test different BES for switching. If switching is not successful, this 
chromatin status may serve as facilitator to rapidly fire active BES transcription. At 24 hr, 
we observed an accumulation of G 2/M cells, which could be a consequence of reduced 
VSG transcript levels [349]. The parasites are probably urged to normalize VSG transcript 
and also protein levels.  
 During switching, what would be the advantage for the chromatin of the originally 
active BES to stay open for several hours? The maintenance of an open chromatin 
structure  prior to a full commitment to a new VSG may serve to “test” si lent BESs: i) 
compatibility of the ESAGs with the infected host as some ESAGs possess isoforms that 
may regulate growth in different mammalian hosts [94]; ii) VSG functionality, similarly to 
what is observed in the mammalian olfactory receptor ( OR) genes in which the 
transcription and expression of a non -functional or mutated OR leads to switc hing to 
another  OR until a functional OR protein elicits a feedback loop mechanism to select this 
single OR and prevent all the other from being expressed [341]. Although selected OR 
gene locus does not possess an open chromatin structure as BES, it is noteworthy that 
alleviation of heterochromatin structure (by means of chromatin marks) of silent OR 
genes is necessary for these to become activated and tested until a final choice is done 
[340]. However, while probing other BES, it is possible that the parasite does not in situ  
switch because it has already switched BES (and its corresponding VSGs) a few times. 
Thus,  it would be interesting to unveil if upon an in situ  switch, the newly silenced BES 
contains a specific mark or modification to avoid switching back to a VSG that has already 105 
 been expressed. For instance, base J is known to be present in silent BES but its functional 
role in these loci remains unclear.  Thus, it would be interesting  to evaluate  by chromatin 
immunoprecipitation (ChIP)  if base J serves as a marker for the  non-transcribed  
intermediate  state  which is maintained if the BES becomes silenced or removed if the BES 
becomes re -transcribed.  Cell-cycle stage dependency was also considered as a putative 
feature that could maintain the active BES in an open chromatin state. Contrary to yeast, 
which shows a replication -dependent nucleosome assembly in Po l I loci  [221], the active 
BES is maintained in an open chromatin state throughout all cell -cycle stages. As t he 
active BES is replicated earlier relative  to the silent BES [361], synchronization and 
collection of cells at different time -points of the S stage to observe chromatin 
conformation in narrower windows of this cell -cycle stage should be inspected .  
Considering that for the parasite it might not be profitable to in situ  switch BES too many 
times, it is possible that this mechanism of keeping BES chromatin open may also be 
useful for VSG  switching by recombination. Thus, the fact that the active BES is  being 
maintained in an open chromatin conformation under transcriptional silencing might 
serve to initiate gene conversion mechanisms to copy intact VSGs from the internal arrays 
or to generate mosaic VSGs.  
A factor that presents a pivotal role in antige nic variation is TDP1. This dissertation 
presents evidence that TDP1 is not only important to maintain chromatin in an open 
conformation during an in situ  switching, but also for monoallelic expression of a single 
VSG. TDP1 is a high mobility group box pro tein that had been previously shown to be a 
Pol I transcription facilitator [13, 14]. Depletion of TDP1 leads to compaction of chromatin 
and decreased transcript levels of Pol I loci [14]. In this work,  we observed that in the 
absence of transcription, TDP1 is crucial to stabilize chromatin in an open conformation in 
the absence of transcription, similar to the yeast ortholog Hmo1 [221]. On the other 
hand, overexpression of TDP1 induced  three different phenotypes: i) Pol II -transcribed 
regions possessed a slightly more open chromatin conformation but with no increase in 
the transcript levels; ii) the active BES and rDNA loci chromatin conformation remained 
unaltered as well as its transc ript levels, suggesting that these loci remain  with their 
chromatin fully open in wild -type parasites; iii) BESs, MESs and procyclin loci acquire a 
more open chromatin conformation and its transcript levels were also increased. 106 
 Nonetheless, expressed silen t VSGs never reach high  transcript  levels , nor the active VSG 
transcript levels decrease, which indicates a crosstalk between BESs that maintains only 
one BES as the active one. Thus, the role of TDP1 in establishing and maintaining an open 
chromatin conformation of BES in BSFs may explain why this pr otein is essential in this 
life-cycle stage [14, 393].  
However, TDP1 may not be as important in PFs as in BSFs. RNA interference (RNAi) 
against TDP1 in PFs does not lead to cell death [393], which may suggest that low levels of 
TDP1 are sufficient for the transcription of rDNA genes (if not all, at least some o f the 
repeats) and for the procyclin locus. Nonetheless, as TDP1 is the only identified nuclear 
HMGB protein, other roles of TDP1 cannot be excluded which can even be differential 
across the  trypanosome  life-cycle stages.  
Another interesting observation is  how chromatin structure changes within the 
BES locus. When TDP1 was depleted using dsRNA, the telomeric region of the active BES 
becomes more affected and becomes repressed earlier than the promoter region. 
Likewise, when TDP1 was overexpressed the promot er region of the silent BESs acquired 
a more open chromatin conformation than the telomeric regions. This suggests that BES 
remodeling tends to protect the telomeric region of the BESs probably through the action 
of several identified factor such as RAP1, TRF or NUP1.  
Interestingly, Baltram et al . have shown that upon overexpression of an ectopic 
VSG from an rDNA locus, the active BES becomes transcriptionally attenuated in a gradual 
pattern, i.e. VSG and more telomeric ESAGs are more transcriptionally down -regulated 
than the promoter region ESAGs  [368]. This attenuation is dependent upon the 
chromatin -associated DOT1B histone methyltransferase, since DOT1B cells do not suffer 
this gradual transcriptional effect and only the active VSG transcripts become depleted. It 
would be interesting to understand i f the open chromatin maintenance in the active BES 
upon transcriptional silencing is also DOT1B -dependent . Thus, considering that in situ  
switching may be a concerted process of factors intervening in the active and silent BESs 
at the same time, it would b e important to better unveil which chromatin factors may be 
associated with the active BES. Although previous attempts to immunoprecipitate 
endogenous TDP1 were unsuccessful to identify putative partners [14], TDP1 loading in 107 
 silent BES during overexpression should be confirmed by ChIP , possibly complemented by 
co-immunoprecipitation (co -IP) of TDP1 under the same conditions to attempt identifying 
its partners.  It is interesting to notice that chromatin is maintained in an open 
conformation in two very different biological processes: differentiation and VSG 
switchi ng. The Navarro lab showed that upon differentiation of BSFs, the active BES 
spatially migrates to the nuclear periphery after 6 hr of induction where heterochromatin 
and also silent BESs are localized in BSFs [11]. However, the chromatin is still maintained 
in an open conformation. It is  thus  possible that TDP1 also has a role in maintaining 
chromatin open in the active BES upon differentiation. However, considering that when 
stumpy forms are subjected to differentiation cues it only takes ~2 -3 hr for full 
commitment to occur [49], it remains a mystery why after 24 hr of differentiation (even 
considering that we used monomorphic BSFs ), the active BES still possesses this 
chromatin structure. It would also be interesting to perform immunofluorescence against 
TDP1 during the first 24 hr after inducing the transcriptional silencing to understand if the 
spatial changes also occur in the a ctive BES.  
What would be the result of overexpressing TDP1 in parasites during a mouse 
infection? With several VSGs expressed at the same time, how does the immune system 
respond? Can the infection be controlled or even eliminated? More than one VSG is 
expressed at the cell surface  upon TDP1 overexpression  but it is  unknown how much is 
the contribution of the “silent” expressed VSGs  relative to the total content of VSG. Is it 
small such that the “silent” VSGs are still untraceable to the immune system? Or are the 
levels of “silent” VSGs high  enough to be recognized by  antibodies?  Experimentally 
addressing t hese questions would allow us  to understand if the effect of TDP1 on 
antigenic variation actually compromises  this survival mechanism.  
Besides antigenic variation, it should also be assessed how overexpression of TDP1 
affects differentiation to stumpy forms and progressively to procyclic forms and even to 
metacyclic forms is affected. Procyclin and metacyclic VSGs become transcriptionally  
upregulated , but it is still unclear  if these proteins are also expressed at the parasite cell 
surface.  If so, it would be interesting to determine if the densely packed VSG coat at the 
cells surface becomes disrupted with the presence of surface proteins  other than 
bloodstream VSGs. Also, all BESs are silenced during differentiation to procyclic forms and 108 
 it is plausible that this process becomes undermined during TDP1 overexpression if BESs 
remain in transcriptionally upregulated , which could potentially  interfere with parasite 
survival in the Tsetse midgut . 
The explosion of the epigenetic  field  has made apparent that, in most eukaryotes, 
chromatin structure  and its dynamics  impose profound effects on almost all DNA -related 
processes, including  transcript ion. This dissertation show ed that chromatin structure 
plays a crucial role in the dynamics of antigenic variation  of African trypanosomes , by 
allowing parasites to go through an intermediary state before parasites choose which 
BES/VSG will be activated.  Although  many questions remain unanswered , we have come 
a step closer to  understanding the regulation of BES expression and switching.  
Antigenic variation is central for African Trypanosomiasis. Advances in the 
understanding of the molecular mechanism und erlying VSG gene regulation brings us a 
step closer to identif ying potential drug targets. It would be interesting if we could lock 
parasites in a VSG switching intermediate state. Impossibility of switching, or incapacity of 
choosing a VSG may be detrimen tal for the parasite and make it more susceptible to 
elimination by the immune system.

ABSTRACT
Antigenic variation in Trypanosoma brucei relies on
periodic switching of variant surface glycoproteins
(VSGs), which are transcribed monoallelically by
RNA polymerase I from one of about 15 bloodstream
expression sites (BES). Chromatin of the activelytranscribed BES is depleted of nucleosomes, but it
is unclear if this open conformation is a mere conse-
quence of a high rate of transcription, or whether it
is maintained by a transcription-independent mech-
anism. Using an inducible BES-silencing reporterstrain, we observed that chromatin of the active BES
remains open for at least 24 hours after blocking tran-
scription. This conformation is independent of thecell-cycle stage, but dependent upon TDP1, a high
mobility group box protein. For two days after BES si-
lencing, we detected a transient and reversible dere-pression of several silent BESs within the popula-
tion, suggesting that cells probe other BESs before
commitment to one, which is complete by 48 hours.FACS sorting and subsequent subcloning conﬁrmed
that probing cells are switching intermediates capa-
ble of returning to the original BES, switch to theprobed BES or to a different BES. We propose that
regulation of BES chromatin structure is an epige-
netic mechanism important for successful antigenicswitching.
INTRODUCTION
RNA Polymerase I (Pol I) transcribes ribosomal DNA
genes (rDNA), which account for over 60% of total nu-
clear transcription (1). Most organisms have large tandemarrays of rDNA genes, but only a fraction is transcription-
ally active. Consistent with their transcriptional activity,
rDNA genes can be found in one of two chromatin states:a compact nucleosome-rich ‘closed state’ and an accessible
nucleosome-depleted chromatin ‘open state’ (2). In yeast,replication of DNA converts the chromatin of most rDNA
genesintotheclosedstate.Whenreplicationiscompleteand
transcription is reinitiated, a stochastic fraction of rDNA
genes regains the open state, in a process that is dependenton Pol I. Once chromatin has an open state, its status is
maintained by a high-mobility box protein, HMO1, inde-
pendentfrom Pol I (3).
Trypanosoma brucei, a unicellular parasite responsible
for sleeping sickness, is an unusual eukaryote that alsouses Pol I to transcribe genes that encode two classes ofabundant surface proteins, the variant surface glycopro-
tein (VSG) and procyclins ( 4,5). Periodic exchange of the
exposed VSG allows the parasites to evade the host im-
mune system, a process known as antigenic variation. Al-
thoughthe T.bruceigenomehasmorethan2000VSGgenes
and pseudogenes ( 6), only one is transcribed at any given
time.VSGs are transcribed from bloodstream expression
sites (BESs), specialized polycistronic units in which a Pol
I promoter drives transcription towards the telomere. Be-
tween the promoter and the telomere there is a variable
number of expression site-associated genes (ESAGs) fol-lowedbyanarrayoftandem70-bprepeatsthatprecedethe
telomere-proximal VSG(7). Among the approximately 15
BESspresentinthegenome,onlyoneisfunctionallyactive,
ensuringthemonoallelicexpressionthatistheheartofanti-
genic variation.
VSGswitchingcanhappenbytwomainmechanisms,by
recombininganewVSGintotheactiveBESorbyswitchingoff a BES and activating another one ( insituor transcrip-
tional switch) ( 8). VSG transcriptional switching involves
two BESs, one that is silenced and another that is con-comitantlyactivated.Cross-talkamongBESshasbeenpro-
posed to explain the phenotype observed when two BESswere simultaneously selected with drug selectable mark-
ers (9). Davies et al.also detected that deletion of a non-
coding DNA sequence upstream of the active VSG, in-
creased switching frequency to a new BES (10). More re-
cently,Batram etal.showedthatuponoverexpressionofan
exogenous VSG, the active BES is partially attenuated into
an intermediate stage, which may allow probing of silent
BESs beforecommitmentto one(11).

Whileinthemammalian-infectivebloodstreamstage,the
chromatinoftheactiveandsilentBESs isdramaticallydif-
ferent.TheactivelytranscribedBESisnucleosome-depleted
(open state), while silent BESs are organized in regularlyspaced nucleosomes (12,13). The promoters of both active
andsilentBESsareboundbythemulti-subunitclassItran-scriptionfactorA(CITFA)( 14),althoughtoadifferentex-
tent (15), which is necessary to regulate BES transcription
initiation.Severalepigeneticfactorshavebeenshowntobenecessary to prevent transcription from silent BESs (16);othersarenecessarytoensurefastswitchingbetweenBESs
(17), but only TDP1 has been shown to be a core compo-
nent of the active BES. TDP1 is a high mobility group box
protein that is present in the chromatin of active BES, and
at rRNA genes, and it is necessary for their transcription
(18,19). The interplay among these factors and the mecha-
nismsbywhichtheyaffect VSGtranscriptionareessentially
unknown.
During the life cycle of T.brucei, parasites shift between
the mammalian host and the Tsetse fly ( 20). To survive in
such different hosts, parasites undergo significant changesin gene expression, which include replacement of the VSG
by the similarly abundant procyclins (21). Silencing of the
activeBESduringdifferentiationischaracterizedbyapro-gressive downregulation of transcription along the BES
(22), together with a re-localization of the BES to the hete-
rochromaticnuclearperiphery(23).Ithasalsobeenshown
thatthechromatinoftheoriginallyactiveBESbecomesless

The goal of this manuscript was to understand the in-
terplay between transcription and chromatin during anti-genic variation. We characterized the early events that takeplace when the active BES is silenced. We found that try-
panosomeshaveacell-cycleandtranscription-independent
mechanism to maintain the open chromatin conformationoftheactiveBES,whichisdependentuponTDP1.Wealso
observed that, in the first two days after transcriptional
silencing is induced, parasites experience an intermediatestageinwhichseveralpreviouslysilentBESsaretemporar-

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Trypanosome cell-linesand plasmid construction
T. brucei bloodstream form (BSF) parasites (strain Lister
427, antigenic type MiTat 1.2, clone 221a) ( 25) were cul-
tured in HMI-11 as described in ( 26). Differentiation stud-
ies were performed in PL1A, a cell-line described in (27).
All transfections were made with an AMAXA nucleofec-
tor(Lonza),programX-001,usingthepreviouslyoptimized
homemade Tb-BSF buffer (90 mM sodium phosphate, 5mMpotassiumchloride,0.15mMcalciumchloride,50mM
HEPES, pH 7.3) (28). GLB1 and its derivative cell-lines
were modified from the parental 2T1.ESPiGFP:NPT ( 29),
inwhichthe NPTgenewasreplacedbyaPCRproductcon-
tainingastopcodonforthe GFPgene,anAldolase 3
/primeUTR,Luciferase andBSRgenes. PCR product was obtained us-
ingprimerswithlongtails(providedinSupplementaryTa-
ble S1) that serve as target recombination regions for GFP
ORF and the BES sequence downstream of GFP::NPT 3’
UTR.
GLB1-TDP1::TY1 was generated by transfecting
pFAB11,whichinsertsaTY1tagatthe3’endofoneofthe
TDP1endogenous alleles. pFAB11 contains a Hygromycin
resistance gene, a 5’-truncated TDP1,aT Y 1t a ga tt h e
3’-end of TDP1 and an Aldolase 3’UTR. pFAB11 was
linearizedwith SmaI(NewEnglandBiolabs),whichdigests
in the middle of TDP1ORF. GLB1-TDP1::3xcMyc was
generated by transfecting pFAB14 which inserts a tripleMYC tag in the 3’ end of one of the TDP1endogenous
alleles. pFAB14 contains a Hygromycin resistance gene, a
5’-end truncated TDP1, a triple MYC tag in the 3’-end of
TDP1and thepredictedendogenous3’UTRof TDP1(30).
pFAB14 was linearized with SmaI (NewEngland Biolabs),
whichdigests in themiddle of TDP1ORF.
GLB1-R15 was obtained by first generating switchers of
GLB1 using the BES silencing inducible assay and sub-sequently transfecting pFAB17 in switchers. pFAB17 con-
tains a 405 nucleotide sequence upstream BES promoter,
the BES promoter, an RFPORF lacking NLS, PEST and
stop codons, amplified from pCAGGS, a NPTORF lack-
ing the start codon, an Actin3’UTR and a 475 nucleotide
sequencedownstreamoftheBESpromoter. RFPandNPT
ORFs formed a fused RFP::NPT gene. pFAB17 was di-
gestedwith AscIandNdeI (NewEngland Biolabs) prior to
transfection.CloningofVSGtranscriptsandsequencingal-lowedidentificationoftheBESinwhich RFP::NPT hadin-

RESULTS
Transcriptionandchromatindynamicsduringdifferentiation
When a bloodstream parasite undergoes transcriptional
VSG switching or when it differentiates into procyclic
forms, the active BES must be silenced and its chromatin
closed (12,13,24). In both processes, the interplay between
transcription and chromatin is unknown. What is the or-
der of these events: does chromatin condensation lead to
a transcriptional silencing, or does transcription stop firstand chromatin is condensed later? We began to tackle this
problem by characterizing what happens during differenti-
ation (Figure 1), and thenin BES switching(Figure 2).
To study the interplay between transcriptional silenc-
ing and chromatin condensation in the active BES dur-ing differentiation, we induced cell differentiation in vitro
by adding the chemical trigger cis-aconitate and lowering
the temperature from 37
◦Ct o2 7◦C. We measured levels of
mRNA at different time points, using a cell-line in whichBES1 is actively transcribed (Figure 1A). As expected,
VSG2transcriptlevelsrapidlydecreased,reaching2%ofthe
bloodstreamformlevels,24hafterinducingdifferentiation(Figure1B). Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) 18Stranscripts re-
mainedunchanged,asexpected( 22),andtranscriptlevelsof
silent VSG9 were slightly reduced. As previously observed,transcriptlevelsofRNAPolymeraseII(PolII)-transcribed
genes, β-tubulinandGAPDH,alsodecreased(22,35,36),the
second reflecting the reduced metabolic dependence of gly-
colysis in procyclic forms.
To test if this transcriptional silencing of the active BES
was a consequence of chromatin conformational changes,we assessed nucleosome occupancy during differentiation
by FAIRE ( 37)( F i g u r e1C). This technique allows the pu-
rificationandquantificationofDNAwithlowproteincon-tent from what we call a more ‘open’ chromatin conforma-
tion (12,31). We observed that, throughout the first 24 hof differentiation, chromatin of silent VSG9,β-tubulinand
GAPDH keptthesameFAIRE-enrichment,suggestingthat
thechromatinremainedequallycondensed.Importantly,atBES1, although chromatin condensed slightly (2.5-fold atVSG2),itremained 12-fold moreopen than asilent VSG.
These results show that, during differentiation, the drop
in mRNA levels of the active BES starts earlier and it ismorepronouncedthanthecondensationofchromatin(Fig-
ure1D), suggesting that chromatin does not close immedi-
atelyafter transcription is halted.
TranscriptionandchromatindynamicsduringBESswitching
Next we hypothesized that, during BES switching, chro-
matin condensation may also be delayed relative to tran-scriptionsilencing.Wepostulatedthat,ifopenchromatinof
theactiveBESwasexclusivelytheconsequenceofhightran-
scription, induction of transcription silencing should leadtoanimmediatecondensationofchromatin.Totestthishy-
pothesis,weusedaBES-induciblesilencingsystemtoblock
the transcription at the active BES and we followed tran-scription and chromatin dynamics. Because BES switching
happensatverylowfrequency,weadaptedapreviouslyes-
tablished reporter strain in which BES1 has a tetracyclineoperator sequence at the promoter followed by a GFP re-
porter (29). When tetracycline is removed from the culture
medium,theheterologoustetracyclinerepressorisfreeand
binds to the tetracycline operator, thus sterically blocking
Pol I transcription. We introduced a luciferase gene down-
stream of the GFPgene since this is a more sensitive tran-
scriptional reporter (Figure 2A). This cell-line was named
GLB1, for
GFP,luciferase andBSRin BES1.
During the first 8 h after tetracycline was removed from
the medium (Tet-), GLB1 cells grew at the same rate as thecontrol (Tet+), after which cell growth lagged until 48–72h( F i g u r e 2B). This lag phase was characterized by abnor-
mal cell morphology and motility (data not shown) andcell-cyclearrestinG
2/M,withaconsiderableaccumulation
of cells with polyploidy or abnormal DNA content (Fig-
ure2C). Quantification of cell death using propidium io-
dide, which only stains dead cells or in late apoptosis ( 38)
(Supplementary Figure S2), showed a significant numberof stained cells from 24 to 72 h after tetracycline removal,
reachingapeakof7.5%at48h.Consistentwiththissignif-icant number of dead cells for several days, clonogenic as-
sayconfirmedthatonly8%oftheinitialpopulationofcells
survive the silencing assay (Figure 2D). After 96 h, surviv-
ing cells took over the culture and grew at normal rate of
around 8 h per population doubling. As expected, all sur-
vivingclonesnolongerexpressedGFP,indicatingtheyhadsuccessfullyswitched toanewBES (Figure 2E).
To test the efficiency of the steric blockade of Pol I upon
tetracycline removal, we checked whether Pol I was evictedfromBES1chromatinfiberbyconductingChIPagainstthe
RPA31 subunit of Pol I (Supplementary Figure S3). As ex-
pected, before BES silencing, Pol I was present in the 18S
rDNA gene and in the active BES genes ( Luciferase and
VSG2)andessentiallyabsentfromPolIIloci(β -tubulinand
GAPDH). 8 hr after BES silencing (tetracycline removal),
the levels of Pol I in the active BES decreased to similar
background levels detected in the silent VSG9, β-tubulin at C M A F on September 2, 2016 http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from NucleicAcidsResearch,2016,Vol.44,No.7 3135

from chromatin fiber upon BES silencing.
Tocharacterizethedynamicofchromatinstructureonce

scriptional changes, confirming that BES silencing only af-fectedexpressionsitesanditdidnotcauseanyothermajorindirect changes in the rest of the genome. Luciferase and
BSRtranscripts decreased 90% of the initial levels, while
activeVSG2decreased less (32%) probably due to its sta-bility (half-life around 4.5 h) ( 35). Concomitantly, we ob-
served a 4–8-fold transcriptional up-regulation of severalsilent VSGs, which is likely a result from either newly ac-tivatedBESs or derepressedsilent BESs.
Todeterminethechromatinstructureoftheinduciblysi-

H3chromatinimmunoprecipitation(ChIP)(Figure 3D).By
FAIRE, we observed that, both at 5 and 8 h after BES si-lencing, the chromatin at the active BES remained highlyenriched in the aqueous phase, indicating an open confor-
mation. During this period, FAIRE-enrichment of silent
BESs (VSG9 andVSG13genes) remained unchanged. Al-

be maximal (up to around 100) because FAIRE was per-formed on a mixed population of switchers. As expected,
18SrDNAand β-tubulindidnotshowmajorchromatinal-
terations at any time. These results were mirrored by his-
tone H3 ChIP: at 8 h, chromatin of originally active BES1
(BSRandVSG2) was still heavily depleted of histone H3,
which is consistent with a high FAIRE-enrichment. VSG2

Overall, our results show that, during BES switching,
chromatincondensationlagssignificantlybehindtranscrip-tional silencing, suggesting that T.brucei has a mechanism
ofmaintainingchromatinopenwhentranscriptionhasbeen
halted.Chromatin conformation is cell-cycleindependent
In yeast, the ratio between open and closed rDNA genes
changes throughout the cell-cycle: entrance into S phaseleads to repression of most rDNA genes and their chro-
matin becomes more compact, while transcription re-
initiation in G
2re-opens chromatin (3). As BESs are tran-
scribed by Pol I, we hypothesized that chromatin of active
BES may also close as a function of the cell-cycle. To test
this hypothesis, we stained GLB1 fixed cells with FxCycle
Violet DNA stain and we FACS-sorted them, according to
the DNA content, into G 1,Sa n dG 2/M subpopulations
(Figure4A).Thechromatinconformationofthesesubpop-
ulations was subsequently assessed by FAIRE (Figure 4B).

possibilitythatveryrapidandtransientchromatinchanges

Unlike rDNA genes in yeast, we observed no major
changes in the chromatin conformation of the active BESthroughout the cell-cycle, which suggests that the mecha-
nismthatkeepsBESchromatinopenintheabsenceoftran-
scriptionopen is verylikely cell-cycleindependent.
TDP1maintainschromatinopenintheabsenceoftranscrip-
tion
Inbuddingyeast,aPolItranscriptionalrestrictionforfour
hours under G
1arrest does not affect the conformation
of rDNA chromatin, which is maintained by HMO1, ahighmobilitygroupbox(HMGB)protein(3).In. T.brucei,
TDP1, a high-mobility group box protein, facilitates tran-
scription of Pol I transcribed genes (18). Here, we tested if
TDP1wasnecessarytomaintainchromatinopenintheab-
sence ofPol Itranscription. For this,we tagged an endoge-
nousalleleof TDP1withaTY1epitopeandweperformed
ChIP. As previously reported ( 18), we found TDP1 highly
enrichedintheactiveBES( Luciferase andVSG2genes)and
18SrDNA (0 h) (Figure 5A). After 8 h of transcriptional
silencing, the chromatin of the promoter-proximal region
of the BES contained the same amount of TDP1, whereas
the telomeric region had two-fold less TDP1. Nonetheless,these levels were still higher (7–9-fold) than in silent VSGs.
As TDP1 inversely correlates with histone H3 (18), this re-
sult is in accordance with the H3 distribution after 8 h ofBES silencing (Figure 3C and D), and it shows that TDP1
is still largely present in the active BES when its transcrip-tion is reduced by at least 90% (Figure 3A). The surviving
switchers (six days post-silencing induction) presented, as at C M A F on September 2, 2016 http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from 3138NucleicAcidsResearch,2016,Vol.44,No.7

TotestifTDP1isnecessarytomaintainchromatinopen
when the active BES is silenced, we depleted TDP1 bytransiently transfecting an anti-TDP1 dsRNA (18). This
methodhasbeenpreviouslyusedtoknock-down /H9251-tubulin
transcripts (39). Transfection with buffer (mock control),
showed no changes in TDP1 levels over time (Figure 5B,
SupplementaryFigureS4A).However,transfectionofanti-
TDP1dsRNAleadtoareductionofTDP1proteinlevelsto
∼18% after 24 h and remained low until 48 h, after whichTDP1levelsincreased(Figure 5B).Consistentwithaprevi-
ousreport(18),weobservedthat24hofTDP1depletionre-sultedina ∼43%reductionofluciferaseactivity,confirming
theroleofTDP1asatranscriptionalfacilitatoroftheactive
BES (Supplementary Figure S4B). To test if TDP1 is nec-
essary to maintain open chromatin status in the absence oftranscription, we transfected TDP1 dsRNA or buffer into
the BES inducible reporter strain and, after 19 h, we tran-
scriptionally silenced the active BES by removing tetracy-cline from the medium. FAIRE was used to characterize
chromatin status 5 h post-silencing (which corresponds to
24hpostTDP1depletion)infourconditions:whenBESsi-lencing was induced or not, and in the presence or absence
ofTDP1(Figure 5C).Asexpected,chromatinchangeswere
notdetectedforcontrolgenes:PolII-transcribedgenes,nor
in silentVSG9. Chromatin of 18SrDNA, although tran-
scribedbyPolI,wasnotaffectedeither,whichisconsistentwith observations in yeast, in which HMO1-null mutantsdo not lead to condensation of rDNA chromatin (3). Rela-
tive to non-transfected control, mock control cells did notdisplay changes in chromatin in any loci, including BES1,indicating that transfection per sedid not significantly af-
fectchromatin conformation (Figure 5C).When TDP1 was depleted but BES1 remained active
(TDP1 KD, Tet+), chromatin remained open in the pro-moter region and began to close at the telomere (VSG2is 2.6-fold more closed than mock transfection), which is
consistent with the observations of Narayanan etal.upon
depletion of TDP1 by RNA interference ( 18). However,
when TDP1 was depleted and BES1 was silenced (TDP1KD, Tet-), chromatin of VSG2closed even further and
chromatin of luciferase also closed slightly (Figure 5C).
Next we compared the change of FAIRE-enrichment af-
ter and before silencing was induced (Tet- versus Tet+),in both conditions: mock transfection (presence of TDP1)
and upon TDP1 knock-down (Figure 5D). For most genes
in both conditions, this fold-change of FAIRE-enrichment
is around 1, indicating that chromatin after 5 h of silenc-
ingisnotdramaticallydifferentandabsenceofTDP1does
not cause global changes in chromatin during this period.However, in the VSG2gene we detected a significant re-
duction in the fold-change of FAIRE-enrichment betweenmockandTDP1depletedconditions.Theseresultsindicatethat TDP1 is necessary to keep an open chromatin confor-
mationwhen transcription ofBES is halted.
We conclude that TDP1 is a key player of the chromatin
of active BES, especially at the telomeric end. Narayananetal.haspreviouslyshownthatTDP1maintainschromatin
nucleosome-depleted and facilitates transcription. Here we
show that TDP1 is crucial to keep an open chromatin in a
BESthathasbeenrecentlysilenced(especiallyatthetelom-
ericend ofBES).

allows parasites to probe different silent BESs before com-
mitting to a new BES. To test this hypothesis, first, we de-
termined how long cells take to commit to a second BES.
For that, we repeated the BES silencing assay but we re-added tetracycline to the cells 8, 24 or 48 h post-silencing.

and GFP-intensity of each clone was measured by FACS.GFP-positive clones indicate that cells re-activated BES1,while GFP-negative clones indicate cells that switched to a
new BES. We observed that, none of the wells were GFP-
negative at 8 h, suggesting that all surviving cells could po-

We postulated that if commitment of most cells happens
between 8 and 48 h, during this period we may be ableto detect cells transiently probing new BESs at intermedi-
ate levels. Such cells were detected by Chaves etal.(9). To
testiftranscriptionofsilentBESsincreasesbeforecommit-
ment, we constructed another reporter strain, GLB1-R15,
in which an
RFP::NPT fusion gene was inserted down-
stream of the silent BES 15 in GLB1 cell-line (Figure 6B).
This reporter allowed us to test at single-cell level whether at C M A F on September 2, 2016 http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from 3140NucleicAcidsResearch,2016,Vol.44,No.7

silentBES15wasbeingtransientlymoretranscribedduring
switching(Figure 6CandD,SupplementaryFigureS5).Be-
fore silencing was induced, a small number of cells (1–2%)expressed low levels of RFP (11–14-fold higher intensitythan background levels), consistent with previous studies
showingthatsilentBESaretranscribedatlowrate( 40,41).
12 h after silencing was induced, we observed an increase
intheproportionoftotalcellsexpressingRFP(2–3%),sug-
gestingthatmorecellsaretranscribingBES15.Thenumber
of cells probing BES15 increased with time up until 36–48h, in which around 20% of the cells showed elevated levels
ofRFP (Figure 6D).
At36h,twonewanddistinctGFP-negativepopulations
were detected: one expressed high levels of RFP (0.7%)(∼200-fold higher intensity than RFP background levels)
and the other was RFP-negative (14.5%), suggesting that
these cells are switchers that silenced BES1 and activated
BES15(orangecurve)oranotherBES(bluecurve),respec-
tively (Figure 6D). In this mixed population of cells, the
switcher subpopulations became more predominant withtime,whilethenumberofcellsprobingsilentBES15gradu-allydecreased.At96h,switcherswerealmostthesolepop-
ulationsinculture(around5%expressedRFPand92%did
not).
Is probing restricted to the promoter region or does it
span an entire BES? Because there is no antibody againstthe VSG11 of BES15, we used an anti-VSG13 antibodyto test if we could detect VSG13 (from BES17) at the cell
surface of silencing-induced cells. Silencing was induced in
GLB1-R15and,at24h,cellswerestainedwithanti-VSG13(BES17) and analyzed by FACS (Figure 6E). We observed
that∼5%ofcellsthatexpressedGFPalsoexpressedhetero-
geneous levels of VSG13. Of these, ∼20% simultaneously
expressed intermediate levels of RFP and VSG13, indicat-
ing that cells can simultaneously probe two BESs, BES15
(RFP) and BES17 (VSG13). These results also show thatprobingisnotrestrictedtothepromoterregionand,atleast
insomecells,theentireBESisupregulatedallthewayuntil
thetelomericend ofBES17.

crease the transcription levels of silent BESs for around 2days, when commitment to a new BES is almost complete;probingspanstheentireBES,untiltheVSGgeneand,albeit

BES probing is areversible intermediate switching step
Next we investigated whether cells that partially upregu-
lated RFP (probing BES15) are true switching intermedi-ates. We chose to characterize the 24 h time-point because
its FACS profile is less heterogeneous (Figure 6C and Sup-
plementary Figure S5) and there are fewer dead cells (Sup-
plementaryFigure S2).Weinduced BES silencingfor24h,
FACS-sorted GFP+ /RFP+ cells, and placed them in cul-
tureinlimitingdilutionsinthepresenceorabsenceoftetra-
cycline (Population 1, indicated in 24 hr FACS plot Figure
6C). We also FACS-sorted and plated GFP+/RFP- cells
(Population 2) because, although BES15 was not upregu-lated,otherBESsmaybeupregulated.Asacontrol,apop-
ulation of cells in which silencing was not induced (Popu-lation 3) was also sorted (Figure 7A). Cells that attempt to
reactivate BES1 die in the absence of tetracycline and sur-
vive in the presence of this drug. Therefore, the number of
surviving clones six days after sorting reflects the efficiencyof BES switching of each sorted population at 24 h post-
silencing. Overall, in the absence of tetracycline, 3–5% of
the clones survived the silencing assay, which is consistentwith8%ofsurvivingclonesmeasuredintheclonogenicas-
sayofthewholepopulation(Figure 2D)andconfirmsthat,
with this inducible system, although we can dramatically
increase the switching frequency from around 1 in a mil-
lion cells to 1 in 10 cells, 9 in 10 cells still fail to switch to
a new BES, even in the populations 1 and 2. When tetra-cycline was added to the culture medium after sorting, the
number of surviving clones doubled (7–9%), which was ex-
pectedbecauseat24hrhalfofthepopulationisstillcapableof returningto theoriginally activeBES1 (Figure 6A).
Seven days post BES silencing, surviving clones were
characterized by FACS for their expression of GFP
and RFP, which we used as reporter of BES activity:
GFP+ /RFP- profile indicates clones that probably did
not switch and reactivated BES1; GFP-/RFP+ indicates
switcherstoBES15;andGFP- /RFP-
 indicatesswitchersto
anotherBES.NocloneswereobtainedthatsimultaneouslyexpressedGFPandRFP.Forbothpopulations1and2,all
post-sorting clones obtained in the absence of tetracycline
no longer expressed GFP and thus represent switchers. In-terestingly,frompopulation1,57%(12clonesonaverageof
three experiments) of switchers expressed RFP, while 43%
(nine clones) did not, indicating that cells can probe oneBESat24hpost-silencingandeventuallyswitchtoanother
BES (Figure 7B). From population 2, all switcher clones
wereRFP-negative(13clones),indicatingthatswitchersac-
tivated a BES other than BES15 (Figure 7B). These results
suggest that if a BES is not probed at 24 h, apparently it isnot fullyactivated later.
When sorted populations were plated in the presence of
tetracycline we obtained some clones that expressed GFPand not RFP, as expected and consistent with the fact thatat 24 h there are still many cells that are not committed
forswitchingandreactivateBES1(Figure 7A).Post-sorting
clonesfrompopulation1showedsimilarproportionsofthe
three different types of GFP /RFP expression profiles, in-
dicating a large plasticity of this population before com-mitment (Figure 7B). In contrast, most post-sorting clones
from population 2 reactivated BES1 (77%, 24 clones) and
none activated BES15 (Figure 7B), suggesting once again
that if a BES is not probed at 24 h, it seems not to be acti-
vated later.
Clones obtained after sorting population 3, in which si-
lencing was never induced, resulted as expected in 100% of
clonesexpressingGFPandnotRFP(Figure 7B),consistent
withBES1remainingactive.Thisshowsthatthestressasso-
ciated with sorting did not induce any unexpected changes
in BES expression.

Transcription and chromatin dynamics in the activeBES
The initial trigger that leads to VSG switching remains a
mystery. However, several studies in which transcription of
theactiveBESwassomewhatinterruptedordiminished,ei-ther due to loss of the VSG upstream sequence (CTR) (10)
orreplacementofaBESpromoterbytheT7promoter( 24),
resulted in more frequent insituswitching, suggesting one
of the earliest events during BES switching is the silencingof the active BES. In this work, we first checked if halting
transcription is also one of the earliest steps during differ-entiationfrombloodstreamtoprocyclicforms,aprocessin
which the active BES needs to be silenced while procyclin
genes are upregulated. We show that, 24 h after inducingdifferentiation, transcription of the active BES is highly re-
duced to 2% (Figure 1B), while the chromatin of this locus
remainsessentiallyopen(Figure 1C).Weconcludethatdur-
ing differentiation, transcription silencing precedes chro-matinchanges,andthusitislikelythatasimilarmechanism
happens duringBES switchingin bloodstreamforms.

that inducible BES silencing promotes a rapid decrease in
transcript levels of genes from initially active BES (at least
90% drop in the first 8 h, as accessed by transcript levels
of the unstable luciferase reporter) and an eviction of Pol I
from chromatin fiber, which confirms that transcription of
active BES is efficiently and rapidly stopped (Figure 3A, B
and Supplementary Figure S3). During this period, chro-
matinremainedinanopenstatedespitetranscriptionbeing
halted (Figure 3C and D). By ChIP, we observed a slight
enrichmentofhistoneH3inthe VSG2geneandadecrease
in TDP1, suggesting a more compact chromatin mainly atthetelomericend ofBES.
Our study also shows that chromatin conformation of
the active BES is cell-cycle independent. Using FAIRE, we
detected no significant differences in chromatin conforma-tion of active BES in cells in G
1,Sa n dG 2/M. Given that,
whenparasitesdivide,mostdaughtercellsusethe‘mother’s’BES and only very few switch to a new BES, it is tempt-ing to speculate that keeping an open chromatin structure
serves as an epigenetic marker that, after cell division, sig-
nals which BES should be used by the daughter cells. Per-haps TDP1 interacts with the cohesion complex, which is
necessary after S phase to maintain the two sister chro-
matidsoftheactiveBESassociatedtothesingleExpressionSiteBodywhilewaitingforchromosomesegregationduring
mitosis (42). This hypothesis deserves further investigation
inthe future.
TDP1maintainsopenchromatinwhenBEShasbeensilenced
High-mobility group box (HMGB) proteins are essential
nuclearcomponentsinchromatinstructure,transcriptional
activityandDNAdamagerepair(43–45).Inyeast,HMO1
is a HMGB protein that is associated with Pol I transcrip-
tion machinery (46), which can competitively displace his-
tone H1 (47) and also maintain chromatin in an open con-
formation (3). In T. brucei, TDP1 is an essential HMGB
protein that is highly enriched in Pol I loci ( 18,19). Like
yeast HMO1, TDP1 is a facilitator of Pol I transcriptionand it is necessary to keep chromatin nucleosome-depletedin a steady-state situation. Here, we show that when BES
silencing was induced in the absence of TDP1, chromatin
became significantly more compact, indicating that TDP1isnecessarytomaintainanopenchromatinstructureinthe
absence of transcription. This role is consistent with what
has been observed in yeast, in which HMO1 maintains PolI chromatin open whentranscription is halted( 3).
In eukaryotes, deposition of canonical histones is nor-
mallyreplication-dependent( 48).Althoughourdatashows
that maintenance of BES chromatin structure is cell-cycle
independent (Figure 4), we predict that during the rare
event of BES switching, chromatin remodelling occurs inS phase of the cell-cycle. Thus, during replication, eviction
ofTDP1fromasilencingBESmaybeanimportantsteptocomplete a BES switching. Regulating the timing of TDP1
eviction may be a means to determine for how long a cell
stays ina ‘probing’ stage,beforecommitment.
It is interesting to observe that, in two different circum-
stances(BEStranscriptionalsilencinginwild-typeorTDP1depleted conditions), the chromatin of the BES telomericendismorerapidlyclosedthanchromatinclosetotheBES
promoter (which can be up to 50 kb upstream from telom-
ere).Telomerespossessahighlycontrolledchromatinstruc-tureand,intrypanosomes,theyareveryimportantforanti-
genicvariation( 49).Itispossiblethat,upontranscriptional
silencing, loading of nucleosomes onto chromatin happens
faster at the telomeric region. Tiengwe etal.found that al-
thoughmostoriginsofreplicationarefoundincoreregionsofthechromosome,VSGgenesalsoharbororiginsofrepli-cation,whichcoulddriveinwardreplicationanddeposition
of nucleosomes (50). Spreading of such chromatin conden-
sation may happen evenly towards the BES promoter or it
mayhappeninstepsiftheBEShasinsulatorelements,such
as the 70-bp repeat array for example, which could prevent
spreadingofnucleosomeloadingintotheupstreamESAGs. at C M A F on September 2, 2016 http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from 3144NucleicAcidsResearch,2016,Vol.44,No.7
Probing and commitment to a new BES
Chaveset al.proposed that, during a switching event, a
cell pre-activates a silent BES before a natural intermedi-
aterapidlyandtransientlyexpresstwoVSGsandultimately
commits for switching or reverts to the original BES (9). A
morerecentstudy,inwhichBEStranscriptionalattenuation
was observed as a consequence of ectopically overexpress-
ing a silent VSG, also proposed that this attenuation couldgivetimeforparasitestoprobesilentBESbeforeswitching
to a fully competent BES ( 11). The nature of what cells are
probing is unknown. It is possible that cells are testing the
order of VSG switching, or if ESAGs are functional, or if
previouslyuntestedor mosaic VSGs are functional.
Our results are in agreement with these models of ‘prob-
ingbeforedecision’andweproposethatregulationofchro-matin structure may be the underlying epigenetic mecha-
nism. We show here that trypanosomes test silent BES be-foreachoiceismadeandthisisassociatedtokeepingchro-
matin of the active BES open (Figure 8). Our commitment
assayshowedthat,8hraftersilencing,nocellsarecommit-tedtoswitchingalthoughsilentVSGtranscriptsarealready
detected (Figure 3B). Half of the cells are committed 24 h
post-silencing, while most of them are committed at 48 h.
From 12 to 48 h, more cells probe silent BESs, but only a
fractionofthecellsexpresseshigherlevelsofRFP,whichin-dicatesthatnotallBESsarebeingprobedatthesametime
in each cell. Nevertheless, we found that at least two BESs
canbeprobedsimultaneouslybythesamecell(Figure 6E).
At 24 h, a small fraction of cells becomes GFP-negative,
consistent with committed switching and this population
becomes more predominant with time. These results showthat probing of one or more BESs is a reversible process
that lasts around two days, during which cells either switch
to the probed BES, switch to a different BES or revert toBES1.RevertingtooriginalBES1isprobablyfacilitatedby
the fact that BES1 retains an open chromatin structure for
at least 24h (Figure 7C).
In some aspects, our model resembles the formation of
poised chromatin. Poised chromatin at Pol II transcribedgenes is characterized by the presence of bivalent marks:the co-existence of activating and repressive histone marks
within the same domains (51). This epigenetic status has
been associated to genes that are transcribed at low levelsbutneedtobeinapreparedstatefordevelopmentalfatesof
rapidactivationorrepression,suchasdifferentiationofem-
bryonic stem cells or activation of T-cells ( 52,53). A poised
chromatinstatehasalsobeenfoundat vargenesinPlasmod-
ium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria. Switchingbetweenvargenes is essential for antigenic variation ( 54).
It is possible that T.brucei uses a TDP1-dependent mecha-
nism as a means of temporarily keeping the active BES inapoisedstate,readyforbeingactivatedorrepressed.Inthe
future, it will be interesting to test whether this mechanism
ofkeepingchromatintemporarilyopenalsofacilitatesVSGswitchingbyrecombination.Inlymphocytes,forexample,it
hasbeenalreadyshownthatthechromatinthatisaccessible
for V(D)J recombination typically displays elevated acety-lationofhistonesH3andH4,whichisahallmarkofamore
accessible chromatin (55).In this study, we showed that the chromatin structure is
kept open by TDP1 probably to facilitate probing, beforecellscommittoanewBES. Itis intriguing that,duringdif-
ferentiation, chromatin of the originally active BES is alsohold open for some time while transcription has already
been reduced. This suggests that differentiating cells may
alsoundergoanintermediatestage,whichmaybereversible.ThisisconsistentwithfindingsbyBatram etal.,inwhichat-
tenuationoftheactiveBESresultsinanintermediatestagethatcanreversiblyprogressintwodirections:differentiationtoprocyclicorreturningtoproliferationinthemammalian
form. The implications of chromatin dynamics in differen-
tiation should be further investigated, and preferably in apleomorphic strain, whose differentiation process is more
similar to whathappens invivo.

Summary
Trypanosoma brucei is a unicellular parasite that
causes sleeping sickness in humans. Most of its tran-scription is constitutive and driven by RNA polymer-ase II. RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcribes not onlyribosomal RNA genes, but also protein-encodinggenes, including variant surface glycoproteins(VSGs ) and procyclins. In T. brucei , histone H1 (H1) is
required for VSG silencing and chromatin condensa-
tion. However, whether H1 has a genome-wide role intranscription is unknown. Here, using RNA sequenc-ing we show that H1 depletion changes the expres-sion of a speciﬁc cohort of genes. Interestingly, thepredominant effect is partial loss of silencing of Pol Iloci, such as VSG and procyclin genes. Labelling of
nascent transcripts with 4-thiouridine showed that H1depletion does not alter the level of labelled Pol IItranscripts. In contrast, the levels of 4sU-labelled PolI transcripts were increased by two- to sixfold, sug-gesting that H1 preferentially blocks transcription atPol I loci. Finally, we observed that parasites depletedof H1 grow almost normally in culture but they have areduced ﬁtness in mice, suggesting that H1 is impor-tant for host–pathogen interactions.Introduction
Trypanosoma brucei is a protozoan parasite responsible
for sleeping sickness in humans (African Trypanosomia-sis). Gene expression in T. brucei has several peculiari-
ties, namely genes being transcribed polycistronically andin a constitutive manner. As a result, most of the genomeis believed to be continuously transcribed and gene regu-lation to happen mainly post-transcriptionally (Claytonand Shapira, 2007). Another unusual feature of transcrip-tion in trypanosomes is that RNA Polymerase I (Pol I) isnot solely dedicated to the transcription of ribosomal RNA(rRNA) genes, but also transcribes loci that encode forabundant surface proteins, such as variant surface glyco-protein (VSGs) and procyclins. Interestingly, so far, Pol I isthe only RNA polymerase in T. brucei for which regulation
at the transcription level was demonstrated (Rudenkoet al., 1989; Gunzl et al., 2003).
VSGs are expressed when parasites reside in the
bloodstream of the mammalian host. They are required forthe parasite to escape the mammalian immune system bya mechanism known as antigenic variation. VSGs are
expressed from a specialized sub-telomeric locus called abloodstream expression site (BES), which also harboursother expression-site-associated genes ( ESAGs ). In the
genome there are ∼15 BESs (Hertz-Fowler et al., 2008),
only one of which is transcriptionally active at a time.Outside BESs, T. brucei also encodes a silent archive of
up to around 2000 VSG genes and pseudogenes
(Marcello and Barry, 2007). Procyclins are a much smallergene family, composed of three EP genes and one
GPEET gene (reviewed in Pays et al., 2004). They are
located in non-telomeric polycistronic units, which alsocontain procyclin-associated genes ( PAGs ). In blood-
stream forms (BSFs), procyclins are kept silent by tran-scriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Thesegenes are activated in a coordinated manner when para-sites differentiate in the gut of the tsetse transmitting ﬂy(reviewed in Navarro et al., 2007).
Chromatin plays an essential role in allowing or restrict-
ing the access to DNA of the machineries involved in genetranscription, replication and DNA repair. Nucleosomesare the basic units of chromatin and consist of ∼145–147
bp of DNA wrapped around an octamer core of histones

H2B, H3 and H4 (Sanicola et al., 1990; Luger et al.,
1997). An additional histone, histone H1 (H1) or linkerhistone, binds to the DNA that links nucleosomes, as wellas DNA entering and exiting the nucleosome core (Nolland Kornberg, 1977; Allan et al., 1980). The binding of H1
stabilizes nucleosomes and promotes the folding of chro-matin (Robinson and Rhodes, 2006). Histone H1 is theleast conserved of all histones (Izzo et al., 2008). In
mouse and humans, histone H1 is encoded by multiplenon-allelic genes, which form several protein variants (11variants in humans) that can differ in their temporal andcell-type expression proﬁles, chromatin-binding affinities,sub-nuclear localization and post-transcriptional modiﬁca-tions (Izzo et al., 2008). In contrast, Saccharomyces cer-
evisiae ,Drosophila melanogaster and Tetrahymena
thermophila each have a single H1 gene (Kasinsky et al.,
2001). In T. brucei , a highly divergent unicellular eukary-
ote (Simpson and Roger, 2004; Dacks et al., 2008),
histone H1 is encoded by a multigene family.
In vitro studies have extensively shown the properties
of H1 in chromatin condensation and transcriptionalrepression (Thoma et al., 1979; Shimamura et al., 1989;
Laybourn and Kadonaga, 1991; Bednar et al., 1998). In
vivo studies have conﬁrmed that H1 is a global regulator of
chromatin architecture (Fan et al., 2005; Masina et al.,
2007; Hashimoto et al., 2010). However, these studies
also revealed that H1 is not a global transcription repres-sor, but rather regulates the transcription of speciﬁc sets ofgenes by a yet unknown mechanism (Shen and Gorovsky,1996; Hellauer et al., 2001; Fan et al., 2005). H1 is also
involved in other biological processes, including inhibitionof DNA repair, telomere maintenance in yeast and mam-malian cells (Downs et al., 2003; Murga et al., 2007),
silencing of retrotransposons at the rDNA locus inD. melanogaster (Vujatovic et al., 2012) and differentiation
and virulence in Leishmania major (Smirlis et al., 2006).
Despite the conservation of some functions, it remainsunclear why H1 is dispensable for survival or growth ofunicellular eukaryotes such as S. cerevisiae andT. ther-

Patterton et al., 1998; Fan et al., 2003), but is absolutely
essential for mammalian embryonic development (Fanet al., 2003).
InT. brucei , H1 seems to be dispensable for growth in
culture, but it is important to maintain VSG genes silent
and to inhibit VSG switching during antigenic variation
(Povelones et al., 2012). Like in other eukaryotes, H1
promotes chromatin condensation in vitro
andin vivo (Burri
et al., 1994; 1995). In this study we show that T. brucei H1
has a speciﬁc role in gene expression, by predominantlyrepressing Pol I transcription, namely of VSG and pro-
cyclin loci. Using labelling of nascent transcripts with4-thiouridine (4sU), we show that H1 appears to act as atranscriptional inhibitor of VSG expression sites and pro-
cyclin loci. We further show that H1 inhibits DNA repair ofmethyl methanesulphonate (MMS)-induced lesions, indi-cating a role for H1 beyond transcriptional regulation.Finally, we show that although H1 seems to be dispensablefor growth of parasites in culture, it is required for the rapidprogression of an infection in mice, suggesting that regu-lation by this histone is important for the host–pathogeninteractions.
Results
Depletion of H1 causes no considerable changes inparasite growth in culture
The current version of T. brucei genome (Berriman et al.,
2005) indicates that there are ﬁve unique H1 genes onchromosome 11. As previously suggested (Grüter andBetschart, 2001), these genes are organized in two clus-ters belonging to a single polycistronic unit and are inter-spersed by 5 non-histone genes. We showed by PCR andSouthern blot that this gene organization is correct in theT. brucei Lister 427 strain, although other H1 alleles may
be missing from the genome database (Fig. S1). Sinceeach gene is predicted to encode a unique protein, weassigned them paralogue numbers from H1.1 to H1.5according to the most recent nomenclature for histonevariants (Talbert et al., 2012) (Fig. 1A). Alignment of
the ﬁve H1 protein sequences reveals that the ﬁrstseven amino acids (a.a.) deﬁne three different types ofN-terminal sequences (Fig. 1B). We classiﬁed themaccordingly and named them MAKTT (H1.1), MAKASA(H1.2, H1.3 and H1.5) and MNNTT (H1.4). The sequenceof the 3 ′UTRs is almost identical between H1 classes
(96% on average), whereas the 5 ′UTRs are less con-
served and speciﬁc for each of the three classes of H1genes (Fig. S2).
To address the function of H1 in T. brucei , we generated
RNA interference (RNAi) cell-lines that allowed simultane-ous inducible depletion of all classes of H1. Because H1genes are 89% identical, we expected that siRNAs gener-ated from a dsRNA of a MAKASA gene (Alibu et al., 2005)
would successfully knock-down all classes of H1 tran-scripts. Indeed, after inducing RNAi in two independentclones (C1 and C2), the mRNA levels of each of the threeH1 classes (Fig. S3) were diminished to 39% on averageduring 6 days indicating that the knock-down was effectivefor all H1 classes in both clones (Fig. 1C, P<0.001;
Fig. S4A, P<0.001). No signiﬁcant differences in H1
depletion levels were observed between day 2, 4 and 6 ofRNAi induction. The non-induced clones also showed areduction of H1 transcripts (a decrease of 30% of theparental cell-line PL1S) (Fig. S4B), which is likely due tothe previously described leaky expression of the RNAi646A. C. Pena etal.■

observed that depletion of H1 resulted in a minor growthdefect in vitro . The doubling times were slightly longer in C1
(7:20 h) and C2 (7:40 h) compared with the parental cell-line PL1S (6:30 h) ( P<0.01) (Fig. 1D). This is consistent
with previous observations (Povelones et al., 2012).
Although these mutants are not a complete knockout of thehistone H1 gene family, our data suggest that H1 is notessential for growth of T. brucei in culture.H1 compacts chromatin at different levels across
the genome
It has been previously demonstrated, using in vitro
systems, that T. brucei H1 can condense chromatin (Burri
et al., 1994; 1995). More recently, Povelones et al. used
electron-microscopy analysis and micrococcal sensitivityassays to show that H1 plays a role in heterochromatinformation in vivo . Here we investigated the role of H1 in
Fig. 1. Depletion of H1 leads to a subtle growth defect in culture.

FAIRE (Formaldehyde-Assisted Isolation of RegulatoryElements) of H1-depleted clones subjected to RNAiinduction for 6 days. By performing a phenol-chloroformextraction on a cross-linked and sheared chromatinsample, FAIRE fractionates DNA that is preferentially lesstightly associated to proteins (such as histones) (Giresiet al., 2007). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to
quantify such enrichment and a plasmid spike with anampicillin-resistance gene ( AmpR ) was used as a nor-
malizer for DNA input. Strikingly, silent BES promoterregions (97 bp downstream of transcription start site)were among the loci in which chromatin opened the most(Fig. 2). In both H1-depleted clones (C1 and C2), chro-matin of the silent BES promoter regions opened onaverage 10-fold compared to the parental cell-line PL1S(P<0.001) (Fig. 2B; Fig. S5A). The chromatin also
opened at the luciferase gene ( LUC ), which is 1.2 kb
downstream of a silent BES promoter, although in aslightly smaller degree (sevenfold relatively to PL1S;P<0.001). In most other loci, loss of H1 resulted in a
1.8- to 4-fold increase in FAIRE enrichment (Fig. 2B),suggesting that chromatin becomes globally more acces-sible. These include silent VSG s from bloodstream
and metacyclic expression sites ( VSG2 ,VSG3 ,VSG18 ,
MVSG ;P<0.01), the procyclin promoter region and pro-
cyclin EP2 gene, typically transcribed in procyclic stages
(P<0.01), transcription start sites of RNA polymerase II
(Pol II) polycistronic units containing either β-tubulin
(β-tub-PR; P<0.01) or structural maintenance of chro-
mosome 3 gene ( SMC3 -PR; P<0.01) and a number of
Pol II-transcribed genes (very abundant β-tub and at
lower levels ISP,SMC3 andPAG3 ). Three loci showed a
non-signiﬁcant tendency for a more open chromatin con-formation: the BES1 actively transcribed genes (blastici-din resistance gene, BSD
R, and VSG9 ) and the 18S
rDNA, all of which had been previously shown to have avery open, perhaps close to maximal, chromatin confor-mation (Figueiredo and Cross, 2010; Stanne andRudenko, 2010).The FAIRE results were further conﬁrmed by chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of histone H3 (as a read outof nucleosome density). As previously shown (Figueiredoand Cross, 2010), FAIRE and H3 ChIP are highly consist-ent techniques and, globally, they reﬂect almost a mirrorimage from each other: for most loci, when chromatinbecomes more open, we detect an increase in FAIRE-enrichment and a decrease in H3 ChIP for both clones(Fig. 2B–C and Fig. S5). A comparison between theP-values of FAIRE and H3 ChIP experiments further con-
ﬁrms the consistency of the two techniques (Table S1).We observe, by ChIP , that most genes lost around 30% ofnucleosomes. As expected, ChIP revealed that silent BESpromoters are the loci that, upon loss of histone H1, lostmore histone H3 (close to 60%). Interestingly, althoughFAIRE did not detect a very dramatic change in chromatincondensation of the procyclin promoter region, H3 ChIPdetected a reduction of nucleosomes more pronouncedthan average (48%). Also FAIRE did not detect a signiﬁ-cant change in chromatin condensation of genes in activeBES, but ChIP could detect a signiﬁcant but modest lossof histone H3 at the promoter region but not at the activeVSG gene. As expected, a gene encoded by the mito-
chondrial genome (cytochrome coxidase subunit III,
COIII , whose genome is not organized around nucle-
osomes), showed only background levels of histone H3(Fig. S5B, P>0.05). Overall, these results conﬁrmed that
when H1 is depleted there is a global loss of histone H3across multiple loci of the genome, except for silent BESpromoters, which opened 10-fold more (60% loss ofhistone H3) and procyclin promoters to a lesser extent.Moreover, our data greatly strengthen FAIRE as arobust method to study global changes in chromatincondensation.
H1 regulates expression of Pol I-transcribed genes
Given the global role of H1 in chromatin condensation, we
next tested how changes in chromatin structure affectedexpression genome-wide. We used RNA-Seq to compare

Chromatin opening was measured by FAIRE (B) and nucleosome occupancy was determined by histone H3 chromatinimmunoprecipitation (ChIP) (C) at several gene loci in parental cell-line PL1S and histone H1 RNAi clones 6 days after induction. DNAisolated by FAIRE was quantiﬁed by qPCR and an enrichment corresponds to a more open chromatin. An AmpR gene contained in a plasmid
spike was used as a normalizer for DNA input. For H3 ChIP, DNA was quantiﬁed by qPCR, compared to the total input material andnormalized to 18S rDNA. Results are expressed as fold-change relatively to parental cell-line PL1S. Note that FAIRE enrichment is
represented in a logarithmic scale. Data for individual clones prior to normalization to the parental PL1S are shown in Fig. S5. Signiﬁcantfold-change ( P<0.05) is shown above (B) and below (C) dashed line in FAIRE and ChIP plots respectively. Two to three independent

RNAi) and parental cell-line PL1S (Fig. 3, Fig. S6,Table S2). H1 depletion resulted in signiﬁcant changes(false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted P-value <0.05) in
the expression of 26 out of 8996 expressed genes(Fig. 3A, Table S2). Interestingly, all were upregulated and
all but one gene are transcribed by Pol I (Fig. 3A–C).
Most of these genes (18) are BES-associated genes
(VSG s and ESAGs ) or genes located in procyclin loci (EP
procyclin genes and PAG s), which are normally silent in
Histone H1 inhibits Pol I transcription and is important for parasite ﬁtness in vivo649
© 2014 The Authors. Molecular Microbiology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Molecular Microbiology ,93, 645–663this stage of the parasite life cycle. In H1-depleted
mutants, BES-associated VSG s are on average 18-fold
more expressed, with a maximal derepression within thissubset close to 65-fold ( VSG8 ) (Fig. 3C, Table S2). Other
eight VSG s annotated as outside a BES were also
upregulated. Because we do not know the genomic loca-tion of these VSG s, we cannot evaluate whether there is
a nearby promoter or polycistronic unit that could readthrough these VSG s. The transcript levels of 592expressed VSG s did not change signiﬁcantly, which is not
surprising because in general VSG genes are located in
tandem arrays that lack a functional promoter (Marcelloand Barry, 2007). Most VSG s are not expressed and thus
were not included in our analysis. H1 depletion also leadto an increased expression of the puromycin resistance(PUR
R) and the luciferase genes (Fig. 3C), both located
immediately downstream of a silent BES promoter(BES1) (Fig. 2A), thus indicating that derepression

shown by the luciferase assay (Fig 4C), the derepressionof silent BESs, is still far from the full activation seen inactive BES, indicating that silent BESs are only partiallyderepressed. Only one of the ESAG s was found differen-
tially expressed ( ESAG2 from BES12) most probably
because the repetitive nature of ESAG s prevented unam-
biguous read alignment and were thus not included in theanalysis. Due to too low unique read counts, the fold-change of ESAG2 remained undetermined.
Although PAG s are located in multiple copies in the
genome, in Pol II transcription units (Kim et al., 2013) or
within the procyclin loci (Haenni et al., 2006), the differen-
tially expressed members of PAG2 ,PAG4 andPAG5 are
speciﬁcally located in these latter loci. For example,although there are two PAG2 genes, one in the procyclin
locus and the other in a polycistronic unit on the samechromosome 10, the only gene that is signiﬁcantly upregu-lated when H1 is depleted is the one within the procyclinlocus.
The results above strongly suggest that H1 predomi-
nantly inhibits expression of Pol I genes. We used geneset enrichment analysis (GSEA) (Subramanian et al.,
2005) to investigate if speciﬁc gene sets are enriched ordepleted among differentially expressed genes. Wefound that genes located in BESs and procyclin loci arevery signiﬁcantly enriched in our list of differentiallyexpressed genes (FDR-adjusted P<0.001), as illus-
trated by the large difference between the detectedenrichment score distribution and the 95th percentile ofthe enrichment scores obtained by random permutations(blue and grey lines, respectively, in Fig. 3D) Thisenrichment is also observed if the two sets of genes areanalysed independently (Fig. S7). This analysis furtherindicates that H1 plays an important role in the expres-sion of Pol I-dependent genes.RNA-Seq results were conﬁrmed at the RNA level by
qPCR (Fig. 4A–B; Fig. S8) and at the protein level byluciferase activity assay (Fig. 4C). First we checked thecorrelation between qPCR and RNA-Seq fold-changesof gene expression of 34 genes selected so that wewould cover a wide range of expression levels. Weobserved a very high Pearson’s correlation ( r=0.90)
between the two types of experimental data, suggestingthat qPCR and RNA-Seq are highly consistent (Fig. 4A).To further conﬁrm the observation that Pol I, but not PolII genes become derepressed when H1 is depleted, wemeasured by qPCR the transcript levels in the two RNAiclones induced for 2, 4 and 6 days (Fig. 4B, Fig. S9).These were normalized to 18S transcript levels because
these are highly expressed genes, depleted of H1(Povelones et al., 2012) and with chromatin largely
insensitive to H1 depletion (Fig. 2B). We conﬁrmed thatH1 depletion did not affect any of the tested Pol II tran-scribed genes nor the actively transcribed VSG9 .A s
detected by RNA-Seq, VSG s in silent BESs ( VSG2 and
VSG3 ) were signiﬁcantly derepressed ( P<0.001)
(Fig. 4B), although the level of derepression was slightlysmaller by qPCR (5- to 12-fold) than RNA-Seq (9- to21-fold). We also conﬁrmed that procyclin EP2 was ﬁve-
fold derepressed. Another VSG in a silent BES ( VSG18 )
and a VSG from a metacyclic expression site ( MVSG )
were found to be four- to ﬁvefold derepressed by qPCR(P<0.001) but were not detected as being differentially
expressed in the RNA-Seq data. This inconsistencymight be due to the fact that silent VSG s and MVSG s
are expressed at a very low level in bloodstream forms(Donelson, 2003) and for this type of genes, statisticaltests for differential expression based on RNA-Seq dataare not very powerful.
Finally, BES derepression was further conﬁrmed at the
protein level by measuring the activity of luciferase in theFig. 3. H1 inhibits expression of RNA Pol I-transcribed genes. Genes with altered expression upon H1 depletion (4 days of RNAi) were
identiﬁed by genome-wide RNA sequencing in BSFs of T. brucei .
A. Volcano plot analysis of differentially expressed genes between RNAi clones C1 and C2 relative to two biological replicates of the parentalcell-line PL1S shows that H1 regulates a small set of genes, mainly located in procyclin loci (red ﬁlled circles) and bloodstream expressionsites (BESs) (red ﬁlled squares). Each point represents a gene, with log2 fold-change (RNAi/PL1S) of gene expression across samples plottedon the x-axis and the corresponding statistical signiﬁcance ( −log10 P-value) plotted on the y-axis. Genes statistically signiﬁcant (FDR-adjusted

activity of 7- to 10-fold ( P<0.001; Fig. 4C), thus con-
ﬁrming RNA-Seq and qPCR data that silent BES1 wasderepressed ( P<0.001; Fig. 4B). Overall, qPCR and
luciferase activity assays conﬁrmed/validated the RNA-Seq data.
We conclude that, like in genome-wide studies in mam-
malian cells and yeast (Hellauer et al., 2001; Fan et al.,
2005), T. brucei H1 is not a global transcription repressor.
It rather regulates a particular subset of genes, by repress-ing expression of Pol I-dependent genes. It is clear that themost signiﬁcant subgroup of genes that is derepressed aregenes from BESs or procyclin loci, conﬁrming that H1 is
essential for keeping these speciﬁc loci fully silent.
H1 inhibits transcription from silent BESs and
procyclin sites
We next sought to understand how H1 depletion leads to
an increase of steady-state mRNA levels of the silentVSG s and procyclins. Because H1 depletion leads to a
more relaxed chromatin at Pol I promoter regions (espe-cially at the silent BES promoters), we hypothesized thatthe increase in mRNA levels resulted from an increase in

Three to four independent experiments were analysed. PL1A refers to a cell-linethat is isogenic of PL1S, but in which BES1 is active and therefore luciferase gene is transcribed at maximal levels.652A. C. Pena etal.■
© 2014 The Authors. Molecular Microbiology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Molecular Microbiology ,93, 645–663transcription rates at these loci. To test this hypothesis
we used metabolic labelling of nascent transcripts with4-thiouridine (4sU). This method allows the quantiﬁcationof newly synthesized RNA in live cells, therefore the directmeasurement of RNA transcription rates with minimalinterference on gene expression and cell viability (Dolkenet al., 2008). After incubating T. brucei BSF parasites with
4sU, total RNA was extracted, thiol-speciﬁc biotinylatedand subsequently puriﬁed on streptavidin-coated mag-netic beads. qPCR was then used to quantify the newlytranscribed RNAs puriﬁed.
We analysed the kinetics of 4sU incorporation into RNA
inT. brucei during 2, 5, and 10 min of labelling. Since newly
transcribed RNA contains higher amounts of unprocessed,primary transcripts, we determined the levels of nascenttranscripts by quantifying the ratio of intergenic relative tocoding sequence expression for 18S and β-tubulin tran-
scripts (Fig. 5A). As expected, we observed a rapidincrease in the levels of 4sU-tagged RNA with increasedduration of labelling (Fig. 5B). Based on this result and onprevious reports (Rabani et al., 2011; Windhager et al.,
2012), we chose 10 min as an appropriate 4sU-labellingtime to estimate transcription rates. We next compared thelevels of nascent transcripts of individual genes in a meta-bolically labelled sample relative to the total RNA. Althoughthe yield of puriﬁcation was generally low (0.015–0.025%),for all measured loci we observed that the labelled sampleshad 7- to 20-fold more nascent transcripts than non-labelled samples (Fig. 5C), indicating that the levels oflabelled transcripts are signiﬁcantly enriched over thebackground.
To test if the 4sU-labelled RNAs are a product of tran-
scription, we repeated the labelling experiment in cellsthat were previously treated for 5 min with actinomycin D(ActD), a well-known transcription inhibitor. We observedthat, upon transcription inhibition, the levels of 4sU-labelled RNAs recovered by MACS were dramaticallyreduced to the same low levels detected in the NO 4sUsamples (Fig. 5D). Altogether these results further con-ﬁrmed that 4sU-labelled RNAs are a reﬂection of thetranscription happening inside live parasites.
4sU metabolic labelling was next used to test whether
H1 depletion results in a higher transcription rate fromBESs and procyclin promoters. For this, RNAi was ﬁrstinduced for 2 days in clones C1 and C2 and, at the end ofthis period, RNAi clones and parental PL1S parasites wereincubated with 4sU. After 10 min the 4sU-labelling reactionwas stopped and total RNA was extracted. The relativeabundance of intergenic transcripts for 18S and β-tubulin
genes showed that puriﬁcation of newly transcribed RNAwas equally efficient in all cell-lines (Fig. 5E). Analysis ofnewly transcribed RNA revealed that H1 depletion indeedincreases the transcription rate from silent BES promoters,resulting in higher abundance of precursor transcripts fromthe BES promoter region BES-P (P<0.001) and the down-
stream luciferase gene ( P<0.001). When H1 is depleted,
transcription rate is also higher from procyclin promoters,since we detected signiﬁcantly more nascent transcriptsfrom the procyclin promoter region ( P<0.01) and at the
EP2 procyclin gene ( P<0.001) (Fig. 5F). These results
show that when H1 is depleted, there seems to be a highertranscription rate of silent BESs and procyclin loci, mostlikely due to an increase of transcription initiation from thepromoter. A Pol II gene ( β-tubulin) showed no change in
transcription rate, conﬁrming the qPCR analysis of steady-state RNA levels (Fig. 4B). Curiously, the BES promoterregions are the loci in which the levels of nascent tran-scripts have increased the most (sixfold), which is consist-ent with the fact that the most dramatic changes inchromatin condensation observed upon H1 depletion wereat the silent BES promoters. This may suggest a moresigniﬁcant role for H1 at silent BESs. We also observed aslight increase in transcription rate at the BSD
Rgene
located downstream of the active BES promoter, consist-ent with the decrease in H3 detected by ChIP . Takentogether, these results not only support our RNA-Seq databut provide additional mechanistic insight, showing thathistone H1 is an effective regulator of transcription at thePol I-transcribed BESs and procyclin loci.
Depletion of H1 increases resistance to MMS-induced
DNA damage
The fact that H1 is required for global chromatin compac-
tion, but it has a very limited role in global transcriptionregulation, led us to hypothesize that H1 may play otherfunctions in the cell. Povelones et al. have recently shown
that H1 inhibits recombination of telomeric VSG genes, but
not of a reporter gene URA3 (Povelones et al., 2012). In
yeast, H1 suppresses homologous recombination (HR)thus inhibiting DNA repair and promoting genome stability(Downs et al., 2003). To test if DNA repair is affected in
T. brucei , we treated H1-depleted clones with a DNA-
damaging agent, methyl methanesulphonate (MMS), andmeasured the subsequent cell survival. MMS is an alkylat-ing agent that stalls replication forks, which are repaired byhomologous recombination (Lundin et al., 2005). Para-
sites in log-phase growth were exposed to MMS for 2days, after which cell viability was measured with AlamarBlue
®. RNAi induction started 2 days before MMS treat-
ment and continued throughout MMS exposure. Weobserved that both H1-depleted clones were clearly moreresistant to MMS-damage than the parental cell-line PL1S(Fig. 6A). IC50 determined from dose–response curvewas on average 2.76 parts per million (ppm) for PL1S andsigniﬁcantly higher for C1 and C2, 4.45 and 4.59 ppmrespectively ( P<0.01) (Fig. 6B). This result indicates that
DNA repair is more effective when H1 levels are reduced.Histone H1 inhibits Pol I transcription and is important for parasite ﬁtness in vivo653

machinery and, as a result, suppresses homologousrecombination.
H1 is important for parasite ﬁtness in vivo
Given the involvement of T. brucei H1 in DNA repair, VSG
transcription and global chromatin condensation, it is sur-prising how H1-depleted parasites can grow so well inculture. Next, we investigated the impact of H1 depletionduring an infection in mice. We inoculated C57BL/6 micewith 100 parasites of the parental cell-line, PL1S, orH1-depleted clones. In the latter, RNAi was pre-induced for2 days with tetracycline.As previously published, mice alsoreceived doxycycline, a tetracycline analogue, in water 2days before infection and during entire infection (Lecordieret al., 2005). Doxycycline had no effect on PL1S-infected
mice (Fig. S10A). Interestingly, mice infected with H1-depleted parasites survived longer ( P<0.01) (Fig. 7A).
Indeed, whereas 55% of the PL1S-infected mice died in theﬁrst 9 days of infection, the majority of C1 or C2-infectedmice survived until day 13 and 15, respectively. Suchprolonged life-span was associated with a delay in parasiteappearance in the blood (Fig. 7B; Fig. S11). In fact,whereas parental parasites reached detectable parasitae-mia within 4–7 days of infection, H1-depleted clones took4–15 days. This is much later than what would be expectedfrom the growth delay measured in vitro (detectable para-
sitaemia should be reached at day 4–5), which indicatesthat host factors must have contributed to this diminishedparasitaemia. It is interesting to note that the least virulentclone (C2) was the one with the most efficient H1 depletion(P<0.05; Fig. 7A–C), suggestive of a dose-dependent
response. Consistent with the fact that in ‘non-induced’RNAi clones H1 transcripts are in fact 20% lower than inparental strain (Fig. S4B), in mice we observed that theseclones caused a slight increase in life-span ( P<0.01)
(Fig. S10B–C). These results clearly indicate that althoughH1-depleted cells have hardly any growth defect in vitro ,
H1 is essential for parasite ﬁtness in vivo .
In around 50% of the mice infected with the parental
cell-line PL1S and 40–75% of the mice infected withH1-depleted clones, two peaks of parasitaemia weredetected (Fig. 7B; Fig. S11). In order to test if parasitesdetected in the second peak of H1-depleted clones wereRNAi revertants, i.e. parasites that have lost the capacity ofperforming RNAi, we measured by qPCR the H1 transcriptlevels at 9–14 days post-infection. We observed that H1transcripts were still reduced to around 40% and 12%,conﬁrming that parasites were still depleted of H1(Fig. 7C).
Typically in a T. brucei infection, parasites in the second
peak of parasitaemia express a VSG different from the one
expressed in the initially injected parasites. In order toconﬁrm that VSG switching took place, we collected C1and C2 parasites from the blood on days 9–14 post-infection and tested whether they were still expressing theoriginal VSG9 or if this VSG had become silent. By qPCR
we conﬁrmed that in H1-depleted parasites VSG9 was no
longer transcribed conﬁrming that these mutant parasiteshad switched VSG s (Fig. 7 D). Overall, these results show
that when H1 is depleted, parasite ﬁtness becomes com-promised but parasites are still capable of switching theirVSG s.
Discussion
H1 condenses chromatin globally but has a more
pronounced effect at silent Pol I transcription units
The ability of histone H1 to drive chromatin condensation
has been demonstrated both in vitro (Thoma et al., 1979;

(Fan et al., 2005; Masina et al., 2007; Hashimoto et al.,
2010; Povelones et al., 2012) for T. brucei and several
other eukaryotes using multiple experimental assays.Using FAIRE and ChIP of H3, we showed here that deple-tion of H1 resulted in a global increase of chromatin acces-sibility (2.9-fold) and a 36% reduction of histone H3 of mostloci, suggesting that H1 maintains chromatin compactedthroughout the genome (Fig. 2B–C). The ﬁrst exception tothis rule is the actively transcribed VSG andBSD
Rgenes
(BES1) and rDNA 18S gene, which probably already have
a maximal chromatin decompaction and therefore chroma-tin remained essentially open in the presence of normal orreduced levels of H1. The most important exception to thisgeneral trend was the chromatin of silent BES promoters,which became 10-fold more open and lost more than 60%
of histone H3. Procyclin promoter regions showed anaverage decompaction by FAIRE, but a signiﬁcant drop inH3 content (48%), suggesting that the chromatin of theseloci is also relatively sensitive to H1 loss. A similar trendwas observed by Povelones et al. (2012) using an MNase
sensitivity assay. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showedthat silent BES promoters have more H1 than procyclinpromoters (Povelones et al., 2012), which may explain
why depletion of H1 results in a more dramatic chromatinopening at the silent BESs than procyclin promoterregions. We conclude that, although T. brucei H1 has a
global role in chromatin condensation, there are genomicsites, such as the BES promoters, in which H1 role seemsto be more important or less redundant.

© 2014 The Authors. Molecular Microbiology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Molecular Microbiology ,93, 645–663Consistent with an important function of H1 in the chro-
matin of BESs and somewhat procyclin promoter regions,almost all derepressed genes identiﬁed by RNA-Seq arefrom Pol I loci ( VSG s, procyclins and PAGs ) (Fig. 3D). It
should be noted that rRNA genes, although transcribedby Pol I, were not included in our analysis due to theirrepetitive nature. How does histone H1 actually affect PolI gene expression? To test if H1 acts at the transcriptionallevel, we chose to measure transcription rate by meta-bolically labelling nascent transcripts with 4sU nucleosideanalogue. The advantage of this approach over theclassic Nuclear Run-On is that the assay is done inunperturbed cells, instead of permeabilized cells or iso-lated nuclei. Despite a low yield of recovery, we clearlyshow that a 4sU-labelled RNA sample is enriched in mol-ecules of RNA that contain intergenic sequences, whichare present in primary, unprocessed transcripts (so-callednascent transcripts). Moreover, we showed that 4sU-labelling is dependent on transcription, suggesting thatthe transcript levels in 4sU-labelled RNAs are a reﬂectionof transcription rates of these genes. Using this metaboliclabelling, we observed that depletion of H1 apparentlyleads to an increased transcription rate of silent procyclinloci and BESs, but no changes in transcription of Pol IIloci (Fig. 5). Because we detected BESs derepressionwith a pair of primers located immediately downstream ofthe BESs silent promoters, we can conclude that H1 actsat least in part as an inhibitor of transcription initiation.These results are consistent with a recently publishedwork that showed that BES monoallelic transcription iscontrolled at least partially at the level of transcriptioninitiation, which is dependent on the CITFA complex(Nguyen et al., 2014). To our knowledge this is the ﬁrst
mechanistic evidence in T. brucei on how depletion of a
chromatin component results in an increase of steady-state transcripts by increasing transcription rate, particu-larly at BESs.
It is interesting to notice that, upon H1 depletion, the
FAIRE analysis revealed that chromatin of a silent BESopened 10-fold at the promoter, 7-fold at the luciferasegene (1.2 kb downstream of BES promoter) and 2.6-foldatVSG2 (56.4 kb downstream BES promoter). Such
gradual decreasing effect of chromatin decompaction withincreasing proximity to telomeres was also detected byH3 ChIP and it suggests that changes in chromatin is nothomogeneous throughout the entire BES. These chroma-tin changes are also reﬂected at the RNA level, since agene close to the promoter of BES1 (Luciferase) wasmore derepressed than VSG2, which is at the telomericend of the same BES (Fig. 4A and RNA-Seq, data notshown). Such disparities of derepression at the beginningand end of a silent BES have been observed in othermutants, namely in mutants for TbISWI, TbSPT16,TbDAC3 and TbNLP , in which the BES promoter regionwas derepressed, but not VSG s (Hughes et al., 2007;
Denninger et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2010; Narayanan
et al., 2011). In contrast, deletion of TbRAP1 and
TbMCM-BP resulted in a stronger derepression of VSGgenes than silent BES promoters (Yang et al., 2009; Kim
et al., 2013). Although it is not clear how these factors
interact with each other to regulate VSG expression,these studies are in agreement with previously describedsilencing mechanisms, which act either at transcriptionelongation level (Vanhamme et al., 2000) or emanate
from telomeric silencing (Yang et al., 2009). In this
context, we propose that histone H1 helps maintaining acompact chromatin structure throughout silent BESs, butwith a predominant role at the promoter regions. When H1is depleted, chromatin of silent BES promoter regionsopens dramatically, facilitating transcription initiation byRNA polymerase I. At the telomeric end of BESs, H1depletion also leads to opening of chromatin but not sodramatically, thus inhibiting transcription elongation. Mostlikely, the same mechanism happens at procyclin loci.
Although depletion of H1 caused global changes in
chromatin condensation, the number of genes with signiﬁ-cantly altered expression levels was low (only 26 out of8996 expressed genes). Similar trends have beenobserved in the past: only 26 of over 6000 genes weredownregulated in H1 knockout mutants of yeast, (Hellaueret al., 2001); and 29 genes in mammalian cells showed an
altered expression of more than twofold (Fan et al., 2005).
In contrast to these organisms, however, T. brucei H1 acts
only as a negative-regulator of gene expression, since H1depletion results in higher transcripts levels for all signiﬁ-cant genes. We conclude that (i) H1 is not a global regulatorof gene expression in T. brucei , (ii) H1 predominantly
represses transcription of silent Pol I genes, and (iii) H1inhibits at least in part transcription initiation from silentBESs. These speciﬁc roles of histone H1 in Pol I loci is likelydue to the fact that Pol I genes are probably the only onesthat are transcriptionally regulated in T. brucei . In fact,
because most Pol II-dependent genes are organized inpolycistronic units, their expression is believed to be con-stitutive and gene regulation of Pol II to occur mainlypost-transcriptionally.
H1 plays a role in DNA repair
It is interesting to notice that the discrepancy between a
global role of H1 in chromatin compaction and the limitedrole in transcription regulation has also been observed inother organisms (Hellauer et al., 2001; Fan et al., 2005). It
is therefore likely that T. brucei H1 plays important but yet
unsolved roles that go beyond transcription regulation.Indeed, in T. brucei ,a si n S. cerevisiae (Downs et al.,
2003), H1 is inhibitory of DNA repair (Fig. 6). This could bedue to the role of H1 in keeping chromatin closed and thus
Histone H1 inhibits Pol I transcription and is important for parasite ﬁtness in vivo657
© 2014 The Authors. Molecular Microbiology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Molecular Microbiology ,93, 645–663refractory to DNA repair machinery. These results are
also consistent with the observations that H1-depletedcells undergo more frequent VSG gene conversion, a
recombination-based switching mechanism (Poveloneset al., 2012).
H1 depletion showed no changes of parasite growth in
culture but revealed important differences of parasiteﬁtness in vivo
InT. brucei , when 61% of H1 is depleted by RNA interfer-
ence a modest defect on cell growth was observed forcultivated bloodstream parasites (Fig. 1 D) (Poveloneset al., 2012). This suggests that, like other lower eukary-
otes, H1 may not be essential for T. brucei survival in
culture. An alternative explanation is that the remaining H1(20–30%) is sufficient for T. brucei survival. When we
infected mice with H1-depleted parasites, these mutantparasites were substantially less infective, allowing mice tosurvive up to twice longer (Fig. 7A–B). This is probablyassociated to the lower parasitaemia in the ﬁrst days ofinfection. Why is parasitaemia lower in an infection withH1-depleted parasites? This cannot be simply explainedby the slower parasite growth rate detected in vitro . Indeed,
based on in vitro growth rate, we estimated a delay in
parasitaemia of up to 1 day, but in vivo the delay ranged
from 1 to 10 days, which indicates that H1 is necessary foradapting to the host environment at the onset of infection.Several mechanisms could explain the reduced ﬁtness ofH1-depleted parasites. First, it is possible that the simplederegulation of gene expression could have a negativeimpact on putative mechanisms that may allow Trypano-somes to sense and adapt to the host environment. Thesegenes could be among the 26 differentially expressedgenes, or other genes whose repetitive nature preventsunambiguous mapping of RNA-Seq reads and accurateexpression analysis (ESAGs and rRNAs, for example).Consistent with this hypothesis, overexpression of H1 inL. major results in a delay in differentiation of promastig-
otes into amastigotes (Smirlis et al., 2006). Second, dere-
pression of silent VSG s or increased VSG switching
frequency may make the ﬁrst peak of parasitaemia aheterogeneous one that is more easily controlled by theimmune system. Indeed, Povelones et al. showed that
deletion of H1 results in a slight increase in VSG switching(Povelones et al., 2012).
When a second population of parasites establishes
(switchers) (Fig. 7D), parasitaemia increases very rapidly,eventually killing the mouse. One possible explanation forthis rapid growth is that, after 9–14 days of infection,parasites have activated a compensatory pathway for H1function, which could involve replacement by other smallchromatin-interacting proteins such as High-MobilityGroup proteins (Hill and Reeves, 1997).In this work we showed that T. brucei H1 keeps chro-
matin globally compact, inhibits DNA repair and repressesthe transcription of Pol I silent genes, including VSG s and
procyclins, which become around 15-fold derepressed onaverage. We showed that such derepression is associ-ated to an opening of chromatin at silent BESs and silentprocyclin loci, which likely results in the observed increasein transcription rate from both types of promoters. Ourdata show that H1 keeps chromatin of silent BES pro-moter and to a lesser extent chromatin of procyclin pro-moters in a condensed state, keeping transcription rate ofthese loci low. It would be interesting to determine if, inother organisms, histone H1 also acts as an inhibitor ofPol I transcription.
Experimental procedures
Cell-lines and growth medium
Trypanosoma brucei bloodstream-form (BSF) parasites
(strain Lister 427, antigenic type MiTat 1.2, clone 221a)(Johnson and Cross, 1979) were cultured in HMI-11 asdescribed in Hirumi and Hirumi (1989). PL1S cell-line wasdescribed in Yang et al. (2009). Cells were diluted according to
their doubling times in order to maintain log-phase growth. Cellgrowth was measured by counting cells in a Neubauerchamber. H1 RNAi cell-line clones (C1 and C2) were obtainedby transfecting T. brucei PL1S cells with a construct (pLF100i),
p2T7TA RNAi vector in which a MAKASA H1 gene is under theinducible control of two opposing T7 promoters (Alibu et al.,
2005). RNA interference (RNAi) was induced by adding 1 μg
ml
−1of tetracyclin (Fisher Scientiﬁc) to the medium for a
maximum of 6 days. Cloning was performed by recombinationof PCR-ampliﬁed fragments using the In-Fusion® HD Cloningsystem (Clontech).
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis
Parasites were harvested by centrifugation at 650 gfor
10 min, 4°C and immediately resuspended in PureZOL (Bio-Rad) or TRIzol (Invitrogen). RNA was isolated following themanufacturer’s instructions and RNA quantity and quality wasassessed on a NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Scientiﬁc). The pro-cedure used to isolate nascent RNA labelled with 4sU isdescribed in a section below. cDNA was generated using aSuperscript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen), according tomanufacturer’s protocol. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was per-formed using 1 ×SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems). Negative controls lacking reverse transcriptase(RT-) were conﬁrmed by qPCR. Primer efficiencies weredetermined using standard curves with 3-logs coverage.Ampliﬁcation reactions were performed in duplicates. Rela-tive quantiﬁcation was performed based on the CT (cyclethreshold) value and the PCR efficiency-corrected method ofPfaffl (Pfaffl, 2001). DNA and transcript levels were normal-ized to those of 18S, which did not change signiﬁcantly
after histone H1 depletion. Primer sequences are listed inTable S3.658A. C. Pena etal.■

Formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements
(FAIRE) was adapted to T. brucei as described previously
(Figueiredo and Cross, 2010). The main difference is thatan external DNA spike consisting of the commercial vectorpBluescript-SK (Promega) was added to the samples priorto sonication. Quantiﬁcation of the FAIRE and total DNAsamples was performed by real-time qPCR as describedabove.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performedessentially as described (Siegel et al., 2009). Histone H3
custom made antibodies were provided by Christian Janzen.
RNA-Seq data analysis
Total RNA was extracted 4 days after induction of H1 depletionin vitro . Ribosomal RNA was depleted with RiboMinus kit
(Invitrogen). PolyA-containing RNA was puriﬁed using Dyna-beads oligo-(dT) (Invitrogen) and cDNA was synthesizedusing random hexamers according to Complete RNA-seqLibrary System kit (NuGEN) instructions. Samples weresequenced in an Illumina HiSeq2000 platform (EMBL).Sequence reads were 100 nucleotides long and paired-ended.Their quality was accessed using the FASTQC quality con-trol tool (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). Contiguous read segments for which the quality scoreat each base was greater than 28 (-h 28), and longer than 25nucleotides (-l 25) were selected using the DynamicTrim andLengthSort Perl-based software respectively (Cock et al.,
2010). The sequencing data were then aligned to a hybridgenome composed of the Tb927 genome (TriTrypDB v 4.1), inwhich the VSG coding regions in subtelomeric VSG arrays
were removed and replaced with the Tb427 VSG coding
regions as a separate chromosome. Alignments wereobtained using bowtie 2 (Langmead et al., 2009), allowing for
one mismatch. Non-unique reads (i.e. aligning in differentlocations) were excluded and the number of reads mappingto each feature (gene) was measured with the htseq-countsoftware (http ://www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq/
doc/count.html) using the ‘intersection-strict’ mode. Thesesequence data have been submitted to the ArrayExpressdatabase (EBI-EMBL) under Accession No. E-MTAB-1715.
Differential gene expression was analysed in R (v 3.0.2),
using DESeq (v 1.14.0) (Anders and Huber, 2010) from Bio-conductor (v 2.6). DESeq uses the negative binomial distri-bution for modelling read counts per genomic feature. Weﬁrst estimated the relative library sizes with the function esti-mateSizeFactors: for a matrix of raw read counts (wheresamples are represented in columns and genes in rows),each column is divided by the geometric means of the rowsand the median of these ratios is used as the size factor forthat speciﬁc column. Then, we used the function estimate-Dispersions: for each condition, it ﬁrst computes an empiricaldistribution value for each gene, then ﬁts by regression adispersion-mean relationship and ﬁnally chooses for eachgene, from the empirical and the ﬁtted value, a dispersionparameter that will be used in subsequent tests. The function
nbinomTest was ﬁnally used to test for differences betweenthe base means of the two conditions (RNAi and PL1S in thiscase).
Feature regions were deﬁned as gene coding sequence
(CDS) regions, except in cases where the number ofuniquely mappable positions inside the CDS is smaller than100, in which case UTRs (annotated by Nilsson et al., 2010)
were also included. To determine uniquely mappable posi-tions we extracted all 100bp sequences (pseudo-reads)appearing in the reference genome and mapped them backusing the same software and parameters used previously.After ﬁltering out non-unique alignments, positions whereone pseudo-read was successfully mapped were consid-ered mappable. We corrected for multiple comparisonsby controlling the FDR, following the Benjamini-Hochbergprocedure (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995), which relies onthe P-values being uniformly distributed under the null
hypothesis consists of sorting the P-values in ascending
order, and then dividing each observed P-value by its
percentile rank to get an estimated FDR (Noble, 2009).Genes with a FDR-adjusted P-value <0.05 were considered
signiﬁcant.
Gene set enrichment analysis
Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed asdescribed in Subramanian et al. (2005). GSEA allows us
to investigate if speciﬁc gene sets (i.e. groups of genes thatshare common biological properties of interest) showstatistically signiﬁcant, concordant differences between twobiological states and are therefore correlated with the phe-notypic distinction under study. Non-expressed genes wereremoved from the analysis and the remaining were rankedby differential expression P-value. For a given gene set
S (in Fig. 3D ‘Genes inside BESs and procyclin loci’; inFig. S7 ‘Genes inside BESs’, ‘VSGs inside BESs’, ‘VSGsoutside BESs’ and ‘Genes inside procyclin loci’), an enrich-ment score was calculated by walking down the ranked listof genes increasing a running-sum statistic when the geneis in S and decreasing it otherwise and extracting itsmaximum value at the end. Thus, a high enrichment scoreindicates a preference for the genes in S to be among themore signiﬁcantly differentially expressed genes. Statisticalsigniﬁcance of this enrichment was determined by compar-ing the observed maximum enrichment score for gene set Swith the distribution of maximum scores obtained by ran-domly permuting the gene ranks 1000 times (histogram inthe top right corner), allowing the estimate of the associatedFDR-adjusted P-value. That signiﬁcance is also illustrated
by comparing the distribution of scores across observedgene ranks (blue line) with a simulation of scores distribu-tion if gene ranks were randomly selected (grey line). Thissimulation was generated by 1000 random permutations ofthe gene ranks and represented as the 95th percentile ofthe enrichment scores obtained.

4sU-labelling and puriﬁcation of nascent transcripts
For metabolic labelling of newly transcribed RNA, 150–185million bloodstream parasites were collected by centrifugationat 970 gfor 10 min, at room temp. and, washed three times
each with 25, 50 and 2 ml of trypanosome dilution buffer (TDB)(5 mM KCl, 80 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgSO
4,2 0 m MN a 2HPO 4,
2 mM NaH 2PO 4, 20 mM glucose, pH 7.7). Cells were resus-
pended in 2 ml of TDB and 4-thiouridine (4sU) (Sigma) wasadded to a ﬁnal concentration of 500 μM for 2, 5 or 10 min at
37°C. In experiments where transcription was inhibited,actinomycin D (Sigma) was added to a ﬁnal concentration of20μgm l
−1, 5 min before starting 4sU-labelling. A negative
control sample, with parasites with no 4sU addition (NO 4sUsample), was also included for each experiment. Total RNAwas extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following themanufacturer’s protocol and RNA was dissolved in RNase-free Tris-EDTA buffer (TE) (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 1 mMEDTA). Sample quantity and quality was assessed in a Nano-Drop2000 (Thermo Scientiﬁc). Biotinylation and puriﬁcation of4sU-labelled RNA was performed essentially as describedbefore (Dolken et al., 2008). Labelled RNA was biotinylated
with EZ-Link Biotin-HPDP (Pierce), dissolved in dimethylfor-mamide (DMF). Biotinylation reaction was carried out in label-ling buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 1 mM EDTA) and 0.2 mg ml
−1
Biotin-HPDP for 1.5 h at room temperature. An amount of
50–90 μg of total RNA was used for the biotinylation reaction.
Unbound Biotin-HPDP was removed by chloroform/isoamylalcohol (24:1) extraction. RNA was precipitated with a 1:10volume of 5 M NaCl, an equal volume of isopropanol and15μg of GlicoBlue (Life Technologies) at 20000 gfor 20 min,
4°C. The pellet was washed with an equal volume of 75%ethanol and resuspended in RNase-free TE. Biotinylated RNAwas captured using μMACS streptavidin beads and columns
(Miltenyi). Up to 58 μg of biotinylated RNA was incubated with
100 μl of beads for 15 min at room temperature, with rotation.
Beads were magnetically ﬁxed and washed 3 ×with washing
buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl,0.1% Tween20) at 65°C followed by 3 ×washes with washing
buffer at room temperature. 4sU-labelled RNA was eluted intwo rounds by adding 100 μl of freshly prepared 100 mM
dithiothreitol (DTT). Eluted RNA was precipitated with a 1:10volume of 5 M NaCl, 2.5 ×volume of 100% ethanol and 30 μg
of GlicoBlue, at −80°C for at least 30 min. RNA was washed in
75% ethanol and recovered by centrifugation as describedabove and resuspended in RNase-free water. cDNA synthesisand qPCR analysis was performed as described in a previoussection. Levels of nascent transcripts were assessed by cal-culating the ratio of intergenic/CDS levels for 18S andβ-tub.I n
this case, an internal normalization for 18S was not needed
since two types of transcripts are being compared inside thesame sample. The fold-change relative to NO 4sU sampleswas then calculated and plotted. In the experiment wheretranscription was blocked by actinomycin D treatment, anequal amount of RNA was used to synthesize cDNA and nofurther normalization was applied. Transcript levels for eachlocus in the MACS-isolated fraction were plotted as fold-change to the NO 4sU sample. To compare nascent transcriptlevels in H1 RNAi clones relative to PL1S, qPCR levels were
ﬁrst normalized to those of 18S transcripts and afterwards
fold-change was calculated for H1 RNAi clones at each locus,relative to its expression in PL1S.
MMS-induced DNA damage
Parasites in which RNAi has been pre-induced for 2 dayswith tetracycline (1 μgm l
−1), were incubated in a 96-well
plate (200 μl per well) with sixfold range dilutions of methyl
methanesulphonate (MMS; Sigma) in HMI-11, at a ﬁnal con-centration of 0.5–4 ×10
4cells ml−1. After 2 days, cell viability
was measured with AlamarBlue® (Sigma). Ten microlitres ofAlamar Blue® was added per well followed by incubation at37°C, 4 h and ﬂuorescence was measured (530ex/590emnm). RNAi induction with tetracycline and selection withHygromycin was maintained during the 2-day exposure toMMS. MMS concentration is expressed in parts per million(ppm) of volume.
Mouse infections
Inbred C57BL/6 wild-type mice (Charles River) were housed inthe pathogen-free facilities of the Instituto de MedicinaMolecular (IMM). The animal facility and the experimentalprocedures complied with European Guideline 86/609/EC,followed the Federation of European Laboratory AnimalScienceAssociations (FELASA) guidelines and recommenda-tions concerning laboratory animal welfare and were approvedby the Instituto de Medicina Molecular Animal Care and EthicsCommittee (AEC_2011_006_LF_TBrucei _IMM). Mice wereinfected intraperitoneally with 100 parasites of T. brucei Lister
427 PL1S and RNAi clones C1 and C2 (with and withoutinduction). RNAi induction was initiated in culture with 1 μg
ml
−1tetracycline 2 days prior to mouse infection. RNAi was
maintained in vivo in mice by watering them with 1 mg ml−1of
doxycycline (doxycycline hyclate, Sigma). Mice receiveddoxycycline 2 days prior to infection and during the wholecourse of infection. Parasitaemia was monitored throughoutinfection by collecting blood from the mouse tail. For RNAextraction of parasites in the blood, between day 7 and 14post-infection, 25–30 μl of blood from the tail of infected mice
(parasitaemia ∼10
8parasites ml−1of blood) was collected in
red blood cell lysis buffer (150 mM NH 4Cl, 10 mM KHCO 3,
1 mM EDTA.Na 2, pH 7.4), washed in 1 ×TDB and extracted
with PureZOL, according to manufacturer’s instructions(Bio-Rad). cDNA synthesis and qPCR were performed asdescribed above.
Statistical analysis
To estimate statistical signiﬁcance of data calculated as a foldincrease, we computed a log-normal posterior distribution ofthe fold-change, using an empirical Bayes approach (FAIRE,ChIP and 4sU experiments). Survival curves were comparedby a Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. The statistical signiﬁcance forremaining comparisons was given by Mann–Whitney Utests.
AP-value <0.05 was considered signiﬁcant. For the statistical
analysis of RNA-Seq data, see RNA-Seq methods above.660A. C. Pena etal.■

enzyme target sequences represented.  H1 loci are colored according to the code associated with the 
5’UTR -specific primers and protein N-terminal sequences defined for Figure 1.  (B) Southern blot analysis 
from T. brucei Lister427 genomic DNA. DNA was double digested with SmaI (S) and BamHI (B) (SB lane) 
and single digested with NheI (N lane). DNA restriction fragments were separated by standard agarose gel 
electrophoresis. DNA probes were made by PCR amplification of specific gene sequences (probe A 
GeneID: Tb11.42.0004; probe B GeneID: Tb11.55.0002; probe C GeneID: Tb11.39.0010; pr obe D

and visualized by phosphorimaging. There were three unexpected bands ( *) which suggest the existence 
of an additional H1 locus . (C) Summary table of P CR and sequencing results of each H1 loci. A putative 
new locus was identified by PCR amplification and sequencing, being compose d by a unique histone H1 
gene.  
 
Figure S2. Each histone H1 class has a unique 5’UTR. (A) Alignment of the predominant 5’UTRs and (B) 
3’UTRs of histone H1 variants of T. brucei . Average percentage of sequence identity  between each variant  
is shown on the left and s equence length on the right of each sequence. Divergent  nucleotides are 
indicated in gray. Gaps (-) were introduced for best alignment. Predominant UTRs in BSFs were derived  
from Siegel et al. (Siegel et al. , 2010)  and Manful et al. (Manful et al. , 2011) .  
 
Figure S3. Specificity of  histone H1 primers. ( A) Class -specific amplification of histone H1 was obtained 
by using forward primer s that annealed with the class -specific 5’UTR and a reverse primer that annealed 
with the conserved  3’UTR sequence common to all H1 classes. Amplification of all H1 classes wa s 
obtained by using a forward and a reverse primer that annealed both to  3’UTR sequences common to all 
H1 classes.  (B) Class -specificity of the primers was confirmed by PCR using as a template plasmids 
containing either MAKASA, MAKTT or MNNTT gene . Primers  for a given class only amplify a fragment of 
the corresponding class.   
 
Figure S4. Efficiency of  Histone H1 depletion . (A) Percentage of depletion of histone H1 classes during 
RNAi induction for 2, 4 and 6 days in RNAi clones  C1 and C2 relatively to the parental cell -line PL1S. 
Primers for all H1 classes and primers specific for each H1 classes were used. Three independent 
experiments were analyzed.  (B) Non -induced RNAi clones C1 and C2 show a reduction of histone H1 from 
77% to 63% of PL1S levels. One and two independent experiments were analyzed for C1 and C2, 
respectively.  Results are shown as mean ± SEM . Statistical significance was determined by a Mann -
Whitney U test .

SUMMARY
Trypanosoma brucei is an extracellular parasite that
causes sleeping sickness. In mammalian hosts,
trypanosomes are thought to exist in two majorniches: early in infection, they populate the blood;later, they breach the blood-brain barrier. Workingwith a well-established mouse model, we discov-ered that adipose tissue constitutes a third majorreservoir for T. brucei . Parasites from adipose tis-
sue, here termed adipose tissue forms (ATFs), can
replicate and were capable of infecting a naive
animal. ATFs were transcriptionally distinct frombloodstream forms, and the genes upregulatedincluded putative fatty acid b-oxidation enzymes.
Consistent with this, ATFs were able to utilizeexogenous myristate and form b-oxidation interme-
diates, suggesting that ATF parasites can use fattyacids as an external carbon source. These ﬁnd-
ings identify the adipose tissue as a niche for
T. brucei during its mammalian life cycle and could
potentially explain the weight loss associated withsleeping sickness.
INTRODUCTION
Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as sleeping
sickness, is a neglected tropical disease that is almost alwaysfatal if left untreated. This disease is caused by Trypanosoma
brucei , a unicellular parasite that lives in the blood, lymphatic
system, and interstitial spaces of organs (reviewed in Kennedy,
2013 ). Disease pathology often correlates with sites of accumu-
lation of the infectious agent within its host, including the brain,
which is associated with characteristic neuropsychiatric symp-
toms and sleep disorder. Weight loss is another typical clinicalfeature of sleeping sickness pathology ( Kennedy, 2013 ), but is
essentially unstudied.
T. brucei is transmitted through the bite of a tsetse and
quickly adapts to the mammalian host to become what is
known as a ‘‘slender’’ bloodstream form (BSF). As parasitemiaincreases, slender forms are capable of sensing population
density, and this triggers differentiation to the stumpy form,
which is pre-adapted to life in the transmitting tsetse vectorand, once there, further differe ntiates into procyclic form
(PCF). Several studies have shown 10%–30% of genes being
differentially expressed between BSFs and PCFs (reviewed inSiegel et al., 2011 ), including genes involved in metabolism,
organelle activity, cell-cycle r egulation, and endocytic activ-
ity. Recent proteomic studie s also revealed around 33% of
proteins that are developmentally regulated ( Butter et al.,
2013 ).
A major difference between BSFs and PCFs is their energy
production, with the former utilizing glucose via glycolysiswithin the glycosome and the latter utilizing proline and, to a
lesser extent, other amino acids as their carbon source, via
the Krebs cycle in mitochondrion (reviewed in Szo¨o¨r et al.,
2014 ). To date, no fatty acid b-oxidation has been observed
as a carbon source in any life cycle stage of this parasite.
This has been a puzzling observation, as the genes requiredfor productive b-oxidation, including the carnitine-acyltrans-
ferases (for mitochondrial import of fatty acids), are present
in the genome.
Here, we describe an additional form of T. brucei in mamma-
lian hosts: we demonstrate that T. brucei accumulates in adipose
tissue, consistent with recent studies showing accumulation of
parasites in the lower abdomen ( Claes et al., 2009; McLatchie
et al., 2013 ). Adipose tissue resident T. brucei have a different
metabolic proﬁle from either slender or stumpy forms in the
blood, and this proﬁle is consistent with their utilization of fattyacids (myristate) as a carbon source. These experiments
describe an additional form of T. brucei life cycle and possibly
explain weight loss (wasting), one of the characteristic patholog-ical features of sleeping sickness.

T. brucei Parasites Are Heterogeneously Distributed
in MiceThe well-established mouse model (C57BL/6J mice with a pleo-
morphic clone AnTat1.1
E) was used to conﬁrm weight loss during
infection as observed in humans with sleeping sickness. Parasi-temia followed a previously described pattern: the ﬁrst peak ofparasitemia occurred 5–6 days post-infection, at around 2 3
10
8parasites/mL, and after approximately 4 days of undetect-
able parasitemia, parasites could be detected again witha ﬂuctuating parasitemia of 10
6–107parasites/mL ( Figure 1 A). Af-
ter the ﬁrst peak of parasitemia, all infected animals showed
reduced food intake and a 10%–15% decrease in body weight.Eventually, all mice recovered normal food intake, although their
body weight remained 5% lower than that of non-infected ani-
mals ( Figures 1 B and S1A, available online). The weight of most
organs from mice sacriﬁced on days 6 and 28 post-infectionshowed minimal changes relative to day 0, except fat depots,
which decreased on average 43% ± 12%. Spleen size and weight
increased dramatically as previously reported ( Figure 1 C). In-
fected mice died 35 ± 2.5 days post-infection ( Figure 1 D).
To assess the parasite load in different organs, we used immu-
nohistochemistry at different days of infection ( Figures 1 E and
S1B). Parasites were consistently detected in the fat 6 days
post-infection and at later time points, while in other organs
they were seen sporadically and at very low densities. As infec-tion progressed, we observed an increase in parasite load in
most organs, with fat, heart, brain, lung, and kidney being the
most visibly inﬁltrated. Parasites were always found extracellu-larly within the interstitium of these organs. In the brain, ourdata corroborate the extensively reported evidence for the local-
ization of parasites being restricted to the choroid plexuses and
meninges ( Kennedy, 2013 )(Figure 1 E).
Histologically, thymus, lymph nodes, bone marrow, skin (of
the head and neck), salivary glands, spleen, gastrointestinal mu-
cosa, testis, and liver displayed few or no parasites ( Figure 1 E;
data not shown). Although parasites in the stroma of the testis
were absent, the epidymal fat body and stroma of the epididymis
(a small paired organ in the posterior end of the testis) containeda signiﬁcant number of parasites, many of which appeared asdebris, but which could explain the bioluminescence detected
byClaes et al. (2009) .
Early in Infection, T. brucei Accumulate in Adipose
TissueImmunohistochemical staining showed parasites in the stroma
of several fat depots: gonadal, mediastinic, mesenteric, retro-
peritoneal, perirenal, and interscapular ( Figure 2 A). Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) conﬁrmed that these parasites
were indeed extravascular, as numerous trypanosomes were
observed in the interstitial space, either between adjacent adipo-cytes or between the adipocytes and the capillaries ( Figure 2 B).
To quantify parasite density, we used as a proxy Trypanosome
genomic DNA (gDNA), which was quantiﬁed at 6 and 28 days
post-infection in the organs/tissues where parasites had beendetected by histology, i.e., fat, lung, heart, kidney, brain, and
blood ( Figures 2 C and S2A). The blood had the highest parasite
density on day 6. Among solid organs/tissues, for the same dayof infection, parasite density was relatively low, except for fat,
which had on average 60-fold more parasites than lung, heart,
kidney, and brain and 7-fold less than blood. On day 28 of infec-
tion, parasite density remained equally high in fat (10
4–105
parasites/mg), while it increased, on average, 20-fold in the
brain, heart, and lung ( Figure 2 C). The overall high parasite den-
sity was detected in all fat depots characterized in this study,with no signiﬁcant differences between white and brown fat de-pots ( Figure S2 B;Supplemental Experimental Procedures ). The
blood was the only site where we observed a decrease in para-
site density during infection, which is consistent with parasitemiadynamics ( Figures 1 A and 2C). As a consequence, on day 28, fat
was the compartment with the highest parasite density (linear
mixed-effects model [LME], p < 0.0001).
Overall, the density of parasites per milligram of organ/tissue
correlated well with the density calculated as a ratio of parasite
gDNA versus mouse gDNA in each tissue ( Figure S2 C). We
also observed essentially the same pattern of parasite densityand the same preferential accumulation in the fat when we quan-
tiﬁed parasite RNA (qRT-PCR) instead of DNA ( Figure S2 D), sug-
gesting that gDNA quantiﬁcation reﬂects accurately the numberof live parasites. Immunohistochemistry also showed accumula-
tion of parasites in fat regardless of parasite strain (EATRO1125
AnTat1.1
E, Lister 427), infection route (intraperitoneal, intra-
vascular), mouse strains (C57BL/6J, BALB/c), animal gender
(male, female), or rodent species (mice, rat) ( Figure S2 E).
Fat represents around 14% of the body weight of a healthy
mouse (Jackson Mouse Phenome Database); thus, it is poten-
tially a very large reservoir of parasites. The number of parasites
in the organs/tissues (parasite load) was determined by multi-plying parasite density by the weight of the organ at the corre-sponding time of infection. For fat, we used the weight of the
six depots characterized in this work, which comprises around
25% of the total body fat. We observed that while 6 days post-infection, the blood contained the majority of the parasites
(around 10
8parasites), on day 28 the six depots of fat contained
overall more parasites than the blood, brain, and all other testedorgans combined (LME, p < 0.0001) ( Figure 2 D). A similar prefer-
ence for accumulation in fat was observed when the mouse
infection was initiated by a tsetse bite, which deposits metacy-clic forms in the skin of the mouse ( Figure S3 ) (LME, p <
0.0001). Overall, these data revealed that fat represents a major
reservoir of parasites, regardless of whether the infection was
initiated by BSFs or metacyclic forms.
Adipose Tissue Contains Replicative and Infective
Parasites
In the blood, parasites can be either replicative slender, G1-
arrested stumpy forms or intermediate forms that are not fullydifferentiated (reviewed in MacGregor et al., 2012 ). To investi-
gate whether the parasites from fat (referred to hereafter as
adipose tissue forms [ATFs]) are replicative or not, we infectedmice with a GFP::PAD1
utrreporter cell-line, in which a GFP
gene is followed by a PAD1 30UTR that confers maximum
expression in stumpy forms (J. Sunter, A. Schwede, and
M. Carrington, personal communication; MacGregor et al.,
2012 ). Four and six days post-infection, blood and fat were
collected, and parasites isolated and puriﬁed. As described by
MacGregor et al. (2011) , on day 4 we observed that most
838 Cell Host & Microbe 19, 837–848, June 8, 2016parasites in the blood were GFP negative (98% ± 0.3%), while on
day 6 most parasites expressed high levels of GFP (86% ±2.6%). Interestingly, from day 5, we noted the presence of
parasites expressing lower levels of GFP, which likely corre-
spond to differentiating intermediate forms (data not shown).As the yield of isolation of ATF parasites was very low on days
4 and 5, we analyzed these parasites only on day 6. The majorityof the ATF parasites were GFP negative (79% ± 4.6%), while
21% ± 4.6% expressed GFP, indicating that on day 6 fat con-
tains fewer stumpy/intermediate forms than blood ( Figure 3 A).

Cell Host & Microbe 19, 837–848, June 8, 2016 839To conﬁrm if GFP-negative ATF parasites are replicative and
GFP-positive parasites are cell-cycle arrested, we stained theparasite nuclear DNA with propidium iodide and quantiﬁed it
by ﬂow cytometry. In all samples (blood day 4, blood day 6,
and fat day 6), we observed that GFP-negative parasites dis-played a cell-cycle proﬁle characteristic of replicative cells
(around 60%–70% of cells in G1, 5% in S-phase and 20%–
30% in G2/M), while GFP-positive cells were cell-cycle arrestedin G1/G0 (90%–95%) ( Figure 3 B). Similar data were obtained
by performing cell-cycle analysis with DyeCycle Violet ( Figures
S4A and S4B), further conﬁrming the presence of slender and
stumpy/intermediate forms in fat.
To validate the presence of stumpy/intermediate forms in fat,
we used ﬂuorescence microscopy on an intact gonadal depot
infected with GFP::PAD1
utr-expressing parasites ( Figure 3 C).

lates, thus conﬁrming the presence of
GFP-positive parasites (stumpy and/or
intermediate forms) in close proximity to
adipocytes. The presence of replicatingparasites in intact tissue was conﬁrmed
by immunohistochemistry with an anti-
H2A antibody. Dividing nuclei were clearlyvisible in close proximity to adipocytes(Figure S4 C), further conﬁrming the ﬂuo-
rescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)
cell-cycle data.
To test whether ATF parasites are
capable of establishing a new infection,
an infected donor mouse was sacriﬁced
and perfused, and several organs were collected, homogenized,
and injected intraperitoneally into recipient naive mice. Parasite-mia was assessed daily thereafter and scored on the ﬁrst day
it became detectable ( Figure 3 D). Mice that received blood or
a fat homogenate showed parasitemia earlier (around 3 dayspost-transplantation) than animals injected with heart and brain
homogenates (around 4 days post-transplantation), consistent
with the observed parasite load in these organs ( Figures 2 D
and 3D). Transplant of intact gonadal fat depot also led to suc-
cessful infection of the recipient naive mice (data not shown),
suggesting that parasites can exit from an intact tissue. These re-sults showed that parasites from fat, heart, and brain are capableof reinvading the bloodstream and establishing a new infection.
Morphology of Adipose Tissue Forms
Although T. brucei is always extracellular, its morphology
changes during the life cycle, which may reﬂect a speciﬁc adap-
tation to the host niche ( Wheeler et al., 2013; Bargul et al., 2016 ).

positioned between nucleus and ﬂagellar pocket ( Figure 4 B).To characterize in more detail the morphology of ATF para-
sites, we compared the length and width of GFP::PAD1 utrpara-
sites isolated from adipose tissue (day 6 post-infection) and

forms), and GFP-positive parasites were collected on day 6 post-infection (mostly stumpy forms). Morphometric measurements were scored from phase contrast

842 Cell Host & Microbe 19, 837–848, June 8, 2016blood (days 4 and 6 post-infection) ( Figures 4 A and 4B). Auto-
matic measurements of phase contrast microscopy images
were generated via HTIAoT ( Wheeler et al., 2012 ) and conﬁrmed
with manual measurements ( Figure S5 A). We observed that
slender forms (GFP negative) from blood and adipose tissue
were very similar both in length (blood, 24.39 ± 2.50 mm; fat,
24.57 ± 2.99 mm) and width (blood, 2.15 ± 0.26 mm; fat, 2.12 ±
0.26mm). This average length is consistent with previous reports
(Tyler, 1998; Tyler et al., 2001; Bargul et al., 2016 ). In blood day 6
post-infection, GFP-positive parasites were, as expected,
shorter (18.43 ± 1.81 mm) and wider (3.11 ± 0.38 mm) than slender
counterparts of day 4, corresponding to the morphology of
stumpy forms ( Tyler et al., 2001 ). Interestingly, in adipose tissue
we found not only stumpy forms, but also GFP-positive parasitesthat morphologically were in between slender and stumpy forms
(length, 21.32 ± 2.73 mm; width, 2.29 ± 0.31 mm) (Tyler, 1998 ).
These probably correspond to the previously described blood in-termediate forms, which, as the name suggests, are not fullydifferentiated into stumpy forms, but could already express
GFP::PAD1 ( MacGregor et al., 2011, 2012 ). These results indi-
cate that adipose tissue is populated by parasites whosemorphology has been previously found in the blood. The only
signiﬁcant difference is their relative distribution: on day 6 of
infection, while blood is mostly populated by stumpy forms,adipose tissue appears to be ‘‘delayed,’’ as we detected both
intermediate and stumpy forms.
At the ultrastructure level, ATF parasites contain all major
structures described in other stages of life cycle ( Gull, 1999 ),
including an electron-dense coat, nucleus, mitochondrion, endo-
plasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, glycosomes, dense granulesand numerous vesicles compatible with endosomes, an internalsubpellicular corset of microtubules underneath plasma mem-
brane, and a ﬂagellum attached to the cell body ( Figures 4 C
andS5B). Using serial 3D tomography, we observed that the sin-
gle mitochondrion of ATF parasites occupies a small volume of
parasite body and is not highly branched ( Figure 4 C;Movie S1 ).
This organization was conﬁrmed by Mitotracker Green staining,which showed no major differences between the mitochondrion
of parasites in blood and adipose tissue ( Figure S5 C;Movie S1 ).
Transcriptome of ATF Parasites Reveals Differences in
Several Key Regulatory Processes
During its life cycle, T. brucei adapts to its environment by
changing gene expression (reviewed in Siegel et al., 2011 ). To
test whether parasites within fat also adapted to the new envi-
ronment, total RNA was extracted from infected gonadal fatdepot (n = 3) on day 6, along with parasites from blood (n = 2)
on day 4 (maximizing slender and minimizing stumpy/intermedi-
ate forms), and was subjected to RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)analysis. As expected, sequence reads from blood samples cor-
responded mainly to parasite transcripts, while sequence reads
from fat corresponded mainly to host transcripts. Nevertheless,the 1%–9% of the sequence reads from T. brucei provided
enough statistical power to detect changes in the transcriptomes
of ATF parasites ( Table S1 ). Two previously published RNA-seq
datasets of BSF parasites grown in culture were also included inthis analysis ( Pena et al., 2014 ).
Unbiased clustering of gene expression proﬁles revealed that
ATF parasites clustered separately from parasites isolated fromblood or culture (
Figure 5 A), suggesting signiﬁcant changes in
their overall transcriptome. Changes were identiﬁed using three
methods of differential expression analysis, and only those genes
identiﬁed by at least two methods with an adjusted p value <0.01were considered. These analyses showed that 2,328 genes
(around 20% of transcriptome) were differentially expressed be-
tween BSF and ATF parasites: 1,160 were upregulated in ATFparasites and 1,178 were upregulated in BSFs ( Figures 5 B and
5C;Table S2 ).
Signiﬁcant changes were found in genes involved in gene
expression regulation, cell cycle, and cell signaling ( Table S3 ).
RNA-binding proteins play an important role in gene expression
and differentiation throughout the T. brucei life cycle. For example,
RNA-binding protein 42 (RBP42; TriTrypDB: Tb927.6.4440, http://
tritrypdb.org/tritrypdb/ ) binds many mRNAs involved in cellular
energy metabolism ( Das et al., 2012 ). Upregulation of RBP42 in
ATF parasites could be involved in the metabolic rewiring whenparasites enter the fat ( Table S3 ).
ATF parasite transcriptome also showed dramatic changes in
gene expression of various post- and co-translational modifying
enzymes that might have considerable inﬂuence on diversecellular processes ( Table S3 ). A small number of genes poten-
tially acting in the cell cycle and cytokinesis was identiﬁed with
signiﬁcant differential expression, including the cytoskeleton-associated AIR9 protein and spastin, which were upregulated
(Table S3 ), suggesting differences in cell-cycle regulation in
these parasites. Consistent with a minor stumpy form populationin fat, we did not ﬁnd enrichment of stumpy-speciﬁc genes in the
transcriptome of ATF parasites. Extracellular signaling mecha-
nisms also seem to be affected in ATF parasites, includingupregulation of TOR3, which can relate the supply of externalnutrients to internal energy levels to regulate cellular growth
(de Jesus et al., 2010 ).
Interestingly, although by TEM an electron-dense coat can
be observed around the parasite ( Figure 2 B), we found that
the transcript levels of the active variant surface glycoprotein
(VSG) (VSG AnTat1.1, CAA25971.1) are 3-fold downregulatedin adipose tissue, suggesting VSG downregulation or VSG
switching within the tissue. As the VSGnome of AnTat1.1E
clone is currently unknown, we could not test whethersilent VSGs were upregulated as a compensatory mechanism.Genes encoding for other surface molecules, such as the
haptoglobin receptor and most procyclins, were not differen-
tially expressed.
Transcriptome of ATF Parasites Reveals Metabolic
Adaptations
One of the most evident changes in ATF transcriptome was the
upregulation of many metabolic pathways, including glycolysis,pentose phosphate, purine salvage, sterol and lipid metabolism,
and, surprisingly, b-oxidation. Thirteen of the 14 enzymatic
steps of glycolysis were upregulated relative to BSFs ( Table
S3). This may either be a response to the lower glucose concen-
tration in fat interstitial ﬂuid relative to bloodstream, or an upre-
gulated gluconeogenesis, which relies mostly on the same
enzymes.
In ATF parasites, genes involved in three out of the ﬁve
biosynthetic steps in the pentose-phosphate pathway were
upregulated, including the rate-limiting glucose-6-phosphate
Cell Host & Microbe 19, 837–848, June 8, 2016 843dehydrogenase (TriTrypDB: Tb927.10.2490). This obser-
vation, taken together with th e fact that numerous enzymes
(16 in total) involved in purine salvage pathway were also
upregulated, suggests that ATF pa rasites may increase purine
production. Interestingly, the purine phosphatases (TriTrypDB:Tb927.8.3800 and Tb927.7.1930) and cAMP phosphodies-terase PDEA (TriTrypDB: Tb927.10.13000) are up- and down-
regulated, respectively, suggesting that the increased pu-
rine production may be directed toward cAMP signaling(Table S3 ).
ATF parasites showed signiﬁcant upregulation of the alanine
and aspartate aminotransferases and the glutamate shunt,which feed products into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Addi-
tionally, this cycle also appeared to be more active, given the up-
regulation in three key steps, allowing it to process succinate,fumarate, and 2-oxoglutarate, resembling the TCA cycle of the
T. brucei insect form (reviewed in Szo¨o¨r et al., 2014 ). These
changes suggest that the F0/F1 ATP synthase complex isfunctional and that the associated electron transport chain isoperating in ATF parasites in a manner similar to that in PCF
parasites.
Signiﬁcant changes in gene expression of lipid and sterol
metabolic pathways were also observed in ATF parasites. How-
ever, one of the most striking observations in the RNA-seq data
was the potential presence of an active fatty acid b-oxidation,

ally Different from BSFs

which produces energy from fatty acid
catabolism. This was unexpected, asb-oxidation activity has never been de-
tected in any T. brucei life cycle stage
to date. ATF parasites showed upregula-tion of the putative genes responsible
for the second and fourth steps of
theb-oxidation cycle (enoyl-CoA hydra-
tase and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, respec-
tively) ( Figure 6 A). Moreover, fatty acid
transport across the mitochondrial mem-brane (facilitated by acyl-CoA synthasesand carnitine-acyltransferases) was up-
regulated, while fatty acid elongases
2 and 4 were downregulated, suggesting
that in ATF parasites, endocytosed fatty acids are not being elon-
gated and anabolized into more complex molecules. Instead,they may enter the glycosomes and/or mitochondrion, where
they are catabolized via a b-oxidation pathway to form acetyl-
CoA (experimentally validated; see below and Figure 6 ), which
feeds into the now-active TCA cycle.
ATF Parasites Have Active Fatty Acid b-Oxidation
To investigate whether ATF parasites are capable of b-oxida-
tion, labeled myristate was used in a pulse-chase experiment
with living trypanosomes, and potential labeled b-oxidation in-
termediates were identiﬁed by gas chromatography-mass
spectrometry (GC-MS). Myristate (C14:0) was chosen, as it
is efﬁciently taken up and incorporated into lipids and gly-
cosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors in the slender BSFparasites (reviewed in van Hellemond and Tielens, 2006 ). Iso-
lated ATF parasites were labeled with deuterated myristate
(D
27-C14:0) for 1 hr and then chased with serum, following
which labeled myristate metabolites were identiﬁed. As ex-pected, BSFs showed accumulation of D
27-C14:0 during the
pulse and chase periods ( Figures 6 B and 6C). ATF parasites
also showed D 27-C14:0 accumulation during the pulse ( Fig-
ure 6 B, upper panel, and Figure 6 C), but the amount of D 27-
C14:0 decreased signiﬁcantly during the chase ( Figure 6 B,
lower panel, and Figure 6 C). Importantly, the decrease of
844 Cell Host & Microbe 19, 837–848, June 8, 2016D27-C14:0 in ATF parasites coincided with the detection
ofb-oxidation metabolites derived from the labeled myris-
tate, including myristoleic acid (D 25-C14:1), 3-hydroxy-myris-
tate (D 25-3-OH-C14:0), and 3-oxo-myristic acid (D 24-3-keto-
C14:0) ( Figure 6 B, right panels, and Figures 6 C,S6,a n d S7).
The latter two metabolites were also observed to some minorextent during the pulse ( Figure 6 B, upper panel, and Fig-
ure 6 C), while D
25-C14:1 was present in higher amount during
the chase period. Minor amounts of unlabeled 3-hydroxy-myristrate (H
26-3-OH-C14:0) were also observed in ATF para-
sites, but not BSFs ( Figure 6 C).
Collectively these data show that ATF parasites are able to
actively take up exogenous myristate and form b-oxidation inter-
mediates, demonstrating the existence of this pathway in try-
panosomes and suggesting that ATF parasites could in part
use fatty acid b-oxidation to satisfy their energy requirements.

DISCUSSION
A well-established feature of the unicellu-
lar, extracellular T. brucei parasite is its
ability to invade the CNS. Here, we show
that while blood is the major site of para-site accumulation on the ﬁrst peak of par-
asitemia, fat contains the highest density
and total number of parasites later ininfection (around 100- to 800-fold more
than the brain). Although the reason(s)
why parasites accumulate in adipose tis-sue remain unknown, we clearly show ithas dramatic consequences for the para-
sites. They functionally adapt to the tissue
environment by rewiring gene expression,including the possibility of using lipids/
fatty acids as a carbon source.
Possible Advantages to Parasite
Accumulation in the Adipose Tissue
Accumulation in the adipose tissue couldbe due to several non-mutually exclusive
reasons that may have provided a selective advantage during
evolution: parasites may be less efﬁciently eliminated by adipose
tissue-speciﬁc immune response, parasites may grow at a fasterrate, parasite differentiation may be delayed, and/or parasite en-
try in adipose tissue may be more efﬁcient in adipose tissue than
in other organs/tissues. Depending on the dynamics of parasitemovement to/from adipose tissue, it is possible that fat acts as a
source of parasites that can repopulate the blood. This reversible
movement between blood and fat could have important impli-cations for (1) the transmission dynamics, since stumpy forma-tion is triggered by a quorum-sensing mechanism ( MacGregor
et al., 2011 ), and (2) antigenic variation, if fat, for example, would
favor the appearance of new VSG variants that could later go tothe blood ( Mugnier et al., 2015 ).
An intriguing question is whether stumpy forms could be
directly ingested by a tsetse ﬂy from the subcutaneous fat.
Cell Host & Microbe 19, 837–848, June 8, 2016 845Although in our histological analysis we did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant
number of parasites in this fat depot, it is possible we missed a
preferential skin location. Moreover, we performed this analysis
in mice infected by intraperitoneal injection, which bypasses theskin as the ﬁrst entry point of metacyclic forms. So it remains to
be determined whether subcutaneous fat is important for accu-
mulation of metacyclics and/or ATF parasites and how it impactstransmission.
Not all Trypanosoma species occupy the same niche in the
host. T. brucei and T. evansi are mainly tissue-invading para-
sites, while T. congolense stays in smaller capillaries and venules
of tissues and T. vivax remains mainly in circulation ( Losos and
Ikede, 1972 ). These differences have been associated with the
different swimming properties of each Trypanosoma species
(Bargul et al., 2016 ). Previous reports had indirectly suggested
that T. brucei parasites could be present in adipose tissue ( Fer-
nandes et al., 1997; Giroud et al., 2009 ). Our study demonstrates
thatT. brucei parasites accumulate in high numbers in the fat of
rodents. Although mouse is an accepted model to study
T. brucei infection ( Giroud et al., 2009 ), we cannot exclude the
possibility that accumulation in adipose tissue is a result of theselection process that happens when T. brucei infects a non-
natural host. In the future, it would be interesting to conﬁrm
whether fat preference is a common feature of this and otherTrypanosoma species in their natural hosts and to compare
their swimming properties in different tissues/organs.
It is intriguing to note that several pathogens infect adipose
tissue. T. cruzi , the causative agent of Chagas disease in Latin
America, invades adipocytes during acute infections in mice
and humans ( Ferreira et al., 2011 ). Also, Plasmodium berghei ,
a causative agent of rodent malaria, sequesters in lungs andfat (Franke-Fayard et al., 2005 ).Mycobacterium tuberculosis in-
fects adipocytes, where it accumulates in intracytoplasmic lipid
inclusions and survives in a ‘‘dormant’’ non-replicating state thatis insensitive to anti-mycobacterial drugs ( Neyrolles et al., 2006 ).
HIV takes advantage of the fat as a viral reservoir during the
chronic stage of infection, and persistence on this reservoir isan obstacle for treatment ( Chun et al., 2015 ). It is possible that
persistence of T. brucei in the fat may also account for some
of the treatment failures in humans ( Richardson et al., 2016 ).
Functional Adaptation to Host Adipose Tissue
A major observation in this work is that 20% of the genes aredifferentially expressed between ATFs and BSFs, which is com-
parable with the differences between BSFs and PCFs (around
30%) and between slender and stumpy BSF forms (around12%) (reviewed in Siegel et al., 2011 ). Parasites adapt to the
fat environment by changing transcript levels of genes involved
in metabolism, signaling, cell-cycle control, and RNA binding.Using biochemical assays, we conﬁrmed that ATF can utilize
fatty acids, i.e., myristate, and catabolize them via b-oxidation,
which could lead to the production of ATP via the TCA cycleand oxidative phosphorylation. Therefore, it seems that para-sites can sense and adapt to the adipose environment by rewir-
ing their gene expression, including the ability to use lipid/fatty
acid as a carbon source.
The major carbon source of BSF and PCF parasites is glucose
and proline, respectively, both of which are readily available
nutrients in the host (reviewed in Szo¨o¨r et al., 2014
). Fat is, inits essence, a lipid-rich environment. Therefore, it is possible
that fatty acids or some other form of lipid are released from
the host adipocytes and are endocytosed or actively transported
via a receptor-mediated process by ATF parasites ( Vassella
et al., 2000 ). So far, only one receptor has been identiﬁed in
T. brucei as necessary for the import of LDL particles ( Coppens
et al., 1987 ). Its transcript levels are not altered in ATF parasites,
suggesting either that this protein can be upregulated post- orco-translationally or that lipid/fatty acid import is mediated by
yet-uncharacterized transporters.
Consumption/utilization of host’s lipids during a T. brucei
infection could contribute to the weight loss observed in patients
with sleeping sickness, cattle with Nagana, and mice infected
with T. brucei (Kennedy, 2013; Ranjithkumar et al., 2013 ).
Interestingly, obese mice ( db
/C0//C0knockout mice) infected with
T. brucei live 3-fold longer than their littermates, suggesting
that having more adipose tissue partially protected mice fromaT. brucei infection ( Amole et al., 1985 ). Because obesity is
associated with persistent low-grade chronic inﬂammation in
adipose tissue ( Ouchi et al., 2011 ), it is possible that in obese
mice, parasites get more efﬁciently eliminated (or controlled),thus prolonging the survival of the host.
Most of what is known today about the mechanisms of viru-
lence, persistence, and transmission of T. brucei results from
studies performed in BSF parasites. The identiﬁcation of adipose
tissue as an additional major reservoir of functionally differenti-
ated T. brucei brings a unique perspective to our understanding
of this parasite and raises several questions. What is the relative
contribution of BSF and ATF parasites for pathogenicity and host
metabolic alterations? Could fat act as a source of parasites ex-pressing novel VSGs? What are the implications of such a largereservoir of ATF parasites in terms of transmission? What are the
dynamics of parasite entry and exit from fat? Given that the brain
is a lipid-rich organ, which is also invaded by T. brucei ,i ti s
obvious to ask whether these parasites also adapt their gene
expression and how this impacts brain-associated pathology.
Do ATF parasites induce changes in the host metabolism,providing an advantage to the parasitic infection? Is the immune
response of the adipose tissue more permissive to T. brucei
parasites? Are anti-trypanosome drugs equally efﬁcient at elim-inating ATFs and BSFs? In sum, our ﬁndings have important con-sequences for the understanding of parasite biology, disease,
and drug treatment efﬁcacy.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Detailed experimental procedures can be found in Supplemental Experimental
Procedures .
Animal Experiments
Animal experiments were performed according to EU regulations and
approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Instituto de Medicina Molecular
(AEC_2011_006_LF_TBrucei_IMM). Tsetse ﬂy infections were performed incompliance with the regulations for biosafety and animal ethics (VPU2014_1)and under approval from the environmental administration of the Flemishgovernment. Unless otherwise indicated, all infections were performed inwild-type male C57BL/6J mice, 6–10 weeks old (Charles River, France), byintraperitoneal injection of 2,000 T. brucei AnTat 1.1
E90-13 parasites. For
parasite counts, blood samples were taken daily from the tail vein. Organs/tis-sues of infected mice were collected at days 6 and 28 post-infection unlessotherwise stated. Animals were sacriﬁced by CO
2narcosis, blood collected
846 Cell Host & Microbe 19, 837–848, June 8, 2016by heart puncture, and mice immediately perfused. Collected organs were
snap frozen in liquid nitrogen or ﬁxed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin. Intransplants, homogenates as well as 600 mL of blood were transplanted into
age- and sex-matched naive mice.
Histology and Electron and Fluorescence Microscopy
Formalin-ﬁxed organs were immunostained with a non-puriﬁed rabbit serumanti- T. brucei VSG13 antigen (which crossreacts with many VSGs) and a
non-puriﬁed rabbit serum anti- T. brucei H2A. For TEM, ultra-thin sections
(70 nm) were screened in a Hitachi H-7650 microscope. 3D reconstructionof isolated trypanosome was done using the IMOD software package version4.7.3 for alignment and modeling ( Kremer et al., 1996 ).
For ﬂuorescence analysis, the gonadal depot was stained with LipidTox,
ﬁxed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin and embedded in Fluoromount-G.Fluorescence images were taken using a 40 3objective in a Zeiss Cell
Observer wide-ﬁeld microscope. For morphometry analysis, isolated parasiteswere ﬁxed with paraformaldehyde, DAPI stained, and embedded in vecta-shield. Images were taken using a 63 3oil objective with optional optovar
magniﬁcation (1.6 3) in the same wide-ﬁeld microscope. Parasite measure-
ments were taken essentially as described in Wheeler et al. (2012) .
The mitochondrion of isolated parasites was labeled using MitoTracker
Green (Invitrogen/Molecular Probes, M-7514) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Fluorescence and DIC images were acquired using a confocal
laser point-scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM 710).
Parasite Quantiﬁcation
T. brucei 18S rDNA genes were ampliﬁed from gDNA of a known mass of tissue
and converted into parasite number using a standard curve. For RNA quanti-ﬁcation, the DDCt method was used by amplifying TbZFP3 and mouse Gapdh
genes from tissue total RNA.
Parasite Isolation from Tissues
Bloodstream parasites were puriﬁed over a DEAE column ( Taylor et al., 1974 ),
while ATF parasites were isolated from gonadal fat depot by incubating thedepot in MEM or HMI11 at 37
/C14C and 150 rpm agitation for up to 40 min.
Flow Cytometry
Cell-cycle analysis was performed using propidium-iodide (PI) or VybrantDyeCycle violet (DCV) in ﬁxed or live cells, respectively. PI staining wasdone according to Aresta-Branco et al. (2016) . For DCV staining, cell suspen-
sions were washed, and 0.5 mL DCV was added per each million isolated
parasites and incubated for 10 min at 37
/C14C. PI, DCV, and GFP intensities
were measured with BD LSRFortessa cell analyzer.
RNA-Seq
RNA and cDNA library of both blood and gonadal fat depot from days 4 and 6 ofinfection, respectively, were prepared as described ( Pena et al., 2014 ), and sam-
ples sequenced in an Illumina HiSeq2000 platform. Reads were processed andmapped to the T. brucei TREU927 genome. Differential gene expression was
analyzed, and genes were considered differentially expressed if they weredetected by at least two of the three considered algorithms (p adjusted < 0.01).
Myristate Metabolic Labeling
To evaluate myristate incorporation and metabolism, the fat isolation protocolwas performed in lipid-free minimum essential medium (MEM). Parasites wereplaced in a vented tube with 1 mL MEM and starved for 30 min at 37
/C14C. Starved
parasites were then labeled with 0.4 mg of radiolabeled D 27-C14:0 pre-
coupled with defatted BSA for 1 hr. A total of 450 mL of the cell suspension
was washed, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and lyophilized in glass vials (pulsesample). The remaining parasites were re-suspended in 500 mL MEM and
100mL HMI11 for 1 hr at 37
/C14C, and at the end processed as for pulse sample
(chase sample). Metabolite extraction, identiﬁcation, and quantiﬁcation wereconducted as described in Oyola et al. (2012) , with the exception that fatty
acids were released by acid hydrolysis (200 mL 6M HCl at 110
/C14C for 16 hr).
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed by ﬁtting LME models with mice asrandom effects unless otherwise indicated. At least three independent exper-iments were considered in each case and statistical signiﬁcance was set to
a= 0.05 level. Data were analyzed after logarithm transformation.

(A) Calibration curve obtained from four independent in vitro  cultures of known cell density. gDNA was extracted, 
serially diluted and amplified by quantitative PCR using T. brucei  18S rDNA primers. The goodness of fit of the linear 
regression is R2 = 0.933. Calibration curve obtained from blood from infected mice (n = 3) (green dots) and from a 
culture of parasites diluted in blood from naive mice (n = 1) (black dots). The goodness of fit of the linear regression is R2 = 0.925. 
(B) Parasite density in six fat depots on day 6 (n = 6-12) and 28 (n = 3-6) post-infection determined by qPCR of gDNA. For each
depot, significant differences were found between days 6 and  28 post infection (Student’s unpaired t test, P < 0.05). 
 (C) Two different gDNA qPCR methods were compared on day 28 post-infection: i. number of parasites per mg of organ (n = 3 - 9) 
and ii. ratio between T. brucei and mouse 18S gDNA (n = 3 - 9). Both methods show a similar parasite density in different tissues  
(LME, P = 0.72).
(D) Parasite density on day 6 and 28 post-infection determined by qRT-PCR of RNA. Transcripts of the parasite TbZFP3  gene
were normalized to the mouse Gapdh . Each point represents the geometric mean of the parasite density on day 6 (n = 3 - 4) 
and on day 28 post-infection (n = 3 - 5). RNA quantification validates the conclusions taken from gDNA qPCR: 
the adipose tissue is the major parasite reservoir (LME, P = 0.0006). The relative contribution of other organs is similar to what 
was measured by gDNA, except for brain, in which parasite density was lower than expected. Perhaps TbZFP3 is downregulated
in this organ.

(A) Parasite density in multiple organs in mice naturally infected by the bite of a tsetse fly. Mice were sacrificed at the first 
and second peaks of parasitemia (10 and 19 days post-infection respectively) and parasite density determined by amplification 
of gDNA, as described in Figure 2. Each point represents the geometric mean of the parasite density at day 10 (n = 4) and 
at day 19 (n = 8).

arrested parasites in fat on day 6 post-infection. 
(A) GFP Expression and (B) Cell cycle analysis in parasites isolated from blood and adipose tissue, 4 or 6 days post-infection, 
assayed by FACS. A GFP::PAD13UTR T. brucei  reporter cell-line was stained with DyeCycle Violet. The histograms represent the 
distribution and the percentage of parasites in each cell cycle stage. DyeCycle Violet staining validates the conclusions taken from 
propidium iodide staining analysis.

(C) MitoTracker Green, which stains in live cells the mitochondrion membrane, regardless of its membrane potential, 
was used to assess mitochondrion morphology. DNA was stained by DAPI and images were captured under a confocal 
microscope. Bloodstream form parasites from day 4 of infection showed a punctate pattern typical of mitochondrion in 
slender parasites, while on day 6, mitochondrion displayed a tubular structure with a few branches in what appeared 
to be stumpy forms. The mitochondrion of adipose tissue forms present a tubular structure, but with fewer branches

Supplemental Experimental Procedures  Ethical Statements Animal experiments were performed according to EU regulations and approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Instituto de Medicina Molecular (iMM) (AEC_2011_006_LF_TBrucei_IMM). The animal facility of iMM complies with the Portuguese law for the use of laboratory animals (Decreto-Lei 113/2013); and follows the European Directive 2010/63/EU and the FELASA (Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations) guidelines and recommendations concerning laboratory animal welfare. The tsetse fly mediated T. brucei infection work was performed in compliance with the regulations for biosafety and animal ethics (VPU2014_1) and under approval from the Environmental administration of the Flemish government.  Cell Lines The majority of the infections described in this manuscript were performed using T. brucei AnTat 1.1E, a pleomorphic clone derived from an EATRO1125 clone. AnTat 1.1E 90-13 is a transgenic cell-line encoding the tetracyclin repressor and T7 RNA polymerase (Engstler and Boshart, 2004). Tsetse infections were performed with T. brucei AnTAR1 strain. We also used T. brucei Lister 427, a monomorphic strain derived from antigenic type MiTat 1.2, clone 221a (Johnson and Cross, 1979). The stumpy reporter cell line GFP::PAD1utr derives from AnTat 1.1E 90-13 in which the green fluorescent protein, GFP, is coupled to PAD1 3’UTR. A nuclear localization signal (NLS) targets GFP protein into the nucleus. Prior to infection, T. brucei cryostabilates were thawed and parasite mobility was checked under an optic microscope.  Mice Infections Mice were group-housed in filter-top cages and maintained in a Specific-Pathogen-Free barrier facility. The facility has standard laboratory conditions: 21 to 22°C ambient temperature and a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle. Chow and water were available ad libitum. Unless otherwise stated, all infections were performed in wild-type male C57BL/6J mice, 6-10 week old (Charles River, France), by intraperitoneally (i.p.) infection of 2000 T. brucei AnTat 1.1E 90-13 parasites. To test if the presence of parasites in fat was dependent on the model, we performed the following variations in the infection protocol: a) male C57BL/6J mice were infected with a more virulent strain, the T. b. brucei strain Lister 427; b) male C57BL/6J mice were infected intravenously (i.v.) in the tail vein; c) a different strain of mice, BALB/c, and 7 week old Wistar rats (Charles River, France) were also infected (the latter with 4000 parasites); d) female C57BL/6J mice and finally e) male C57BL/6J mice naturally infected by tsetse bite. For this latter protocol, freshly emerged Glossina morsitans morsitans flies were fed their first blood meal on a T. brucei AnTAR1 infected mice at the peak of parasitemia. Subsequently, flies were maintained on commercially available defibrinated horse blood through in vitro membrane feeding. Thirty days after the infective blood meal, individual flies were evaluated for the presence of metacyclic trypanosomes in their salivary glands by salivation on pre-warmed (37°C) glass slides. To initiate a natural infection, one individual tsetse fly with a mature salivary gland infection was allowed to probe and feed per mouse.   Clinical Parameters and Organ Collection All measurements in mice were made between 17:00 and 18:00. For parasite counts, blood samples were taken daily from the tail vein, and parasitemia was determined by manual counting using a Neubauer chamber. Organs/tissues of infected C57BL/6J mice (male and female) were collected at days 6, 13, 21 and 28 post-infection; for the infection with T. b. brucei strain Lister 427, organs were collected once parasitemia reached 1x108 parasites/mL; for BALB/c mice, at day 6 post-infection; and for Wistar rats and C57BL/6J mice i.v. infections, at days 6, 13 and 20 post-infection. Animals were sacrificed by CO2 narcosis, blood was collected by cardiac puncture and perfusion was performed to eliminate blood and parasites from circulation. Briefly, mice were perfused transcardially with pre-warmed heparinized saline (50 mL 1X phosphate buffered saline (1X PBS) with 250 µL of 5000 I.U./mL heparine per animal) using a peristaltic pump, ranging its speed from 2 mL/min to 8 mL/min. Organs were then collected and either used immediately for parasites isolation, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for molecular analysis, or fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for histopathology.  Transplantations Donor mice were sacrificed with CO2 narcosis (at days 21 and 28 post-infection) and the gonadal fat depot, brain, heart, and 600 µL of blood were harvested. Organs were manually homogenized through a 70 µm mesh into 1X PBS. Cell suspension was centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 minutes and resuspended in 800 µL of HMI11. Tissue lysates were injected intraperitoneally in naïve mice. Blood was diluted in 1X PBS and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 2800 g. Cell pellet was diluted in 800 µL of 1X PBS and injected intraperitoneally in naïve mice.  Histology Formalin-fixed organs were embedded in paraffin and 3µm sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). For immunohistochemistry, 3µm sections were stained for VSG using non-purified rabbit sera anti-T. brucei VSG13 antigen (cross-reactive with most VSGs via the C-terminal domain) or anti-T. brucei H2A (generated against a recombinant protein) (kind gift of Christian Janzen), diluted 1:5000 and 1:3000, respectively. Briefly, antigen heat-retrieval was performed in a microwave oven (800 w) for 15 minutes with pH 9 Sodium Citrate buffer (Leica Biosystems, MO, USA). Incubation with ENVISION kit (Peroxidase/DAB detection system, Dako Corp, Santa Barbara, CA) was followed by Mayer’s hemalumen counterstaining. No staining was observed in the negative control (without primary antibody). Tissue sections were examined by a pathologist (TC), blinded to experimental groups, in a Leica DM2500 microscope coupled to a Leica MC170 HD microscope camera.  For transmission electron microscopy, gonadal fat depot from infected mice (days 6 and 28 post-infection) was collected and fixed for three hours at 4ºC in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde. After staining for 1 hour with 1% (w/v) osmium tetroxide and 30 minutes with 1% (w/v) uranyl acetate, samples were dehydrated in an ethanol gradient (70-95-100%), transferred to propylene oxide and embedded in EPON™ resin. Semi-thin sections (300-400 nm) were stained with toluidine blue for light microscopy evaluation. Ultra-thin sections (70 nm) were collected in copper slot grids and stained with 2% uranyl acetate and lead citrate (Reynolds recipe). Grids were screened in a Hitachi H-7650 transmission electron microscope at 100 kV acceleration. For 3D reconstruction of isolated trypanosomes, parasites isolated from gonadal fat depot were centrifuged at 5000 rpm and processed as described above for whole tissue. After embedding, approximately 26 serial ultra-thin sections (70 nm) were collected for each individual parasite. Grids of seven parasites were screened in a Hitachi H-7650 transmission electron microscope at 100 kV acceleration, serial section alignment was achieved using the IMOD software package version 4.7.3 for alignment and modeling (Kremer et al., 1996). ,Videos were projected using ImageJ 4.47v.   Microscopy analysis Parasites from blood were isolated using a DEAE column (Taylor et al., 1974) and parasites from fat were isolated from gonadal fat depot by incubating the depot in HMI11 for up to 40 minutes and then purified from tissue debris over a DEAE column. For morphometric analysis, 1x106 parasites were settled for 15 minutes to a pre-coated dish with 10% poly-Lysine, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes at room temperature, washed with 1X PBS and stained with diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (5 μg/mL in 1X PBS). Vectashield solution was used to mount the dish. Fluorescence and Phase Contrast images were acquired using Zeiss Cell Observer wide-field microscope. Parasite length was taken essentially as described in (Wheeler et al., 2012). Parasite width was manually scored in the nuclear region of the cell body. For mitochondrial staining, isolated parasites were incubated in HMI-11 with 700 µM MitoTracker Green for 30 minutes at 37˚C. Excess of MitoTracker stain was removed and cells were chased in HMI-11 medium for 40 minutes at 37˚C. After washing with 1X PBS, cells were fixed and handled as above. Fluorescence and DIC images were acquired using a confocal Laser Point-Scanning Microscope (Zeiss LSM 710).  For tissue fluorescence analysis, the gonadal depot was stained with LipidTox (1:200 v/v in 1X PBS) for 30 minutes at 4ºc with agitation and then fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, Sigma, and washed twice in 1 mL 1X PBS for 30 minutes at 37ºC with 150 rpm horizontal agitation. After, fat samples were embedded and mounted in Fluoromount-G. Fluorescence images were taken using a 40X objective in a Zeiss Cell Observer WF Microscope.  Parasite quantification in organs and tissues Collected organs/tissues were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from tissues using NZY tissue gDNA isolation kit (NZYTech, Portugal). The primers used for amplification of 18S rDNA gene of T. brucei were 5’–ACGGAATGGCACCACAAGAC–3’ and 5’–GTCCGTTGACGGAATCAACC–3’ and for the mouse 18S rDNA gene were 5’–TCGAGGCCCTGTAATTGGAA–3’ and 5’–CTTTAATATACGCTATTGGAGCTGGAA–3’. By qPCR, the amount of T. brucei 18S rDNA present per milligram of organ/tissue were measured and converted into number of parasites using a calibration curve. The curve used to calculate parasite density in most solid organs/tissues was obtained by quantifying T. brucei 18S rDNA from serial dilutions of four independent cultures of AnTat1.1E 90-13 of known cell densities. Because PCR amplification from blood genomic DNA is sensitive to hemoglobin, we made a calibration curve specifically for blood samples, which was obtained by quantifying T. brucei 18S rDNA from blood from three infected mice of known parasitemia and from a known number of culture parasites diluted in blood. Parasite density in organs/tissues was calculated by dividing the number of parasites by the weight of organ/tissue used for qPCR, while total parasite load was calculated by multiplying the number of parasites/mg by the weight of organ/tissue at the corresponding day of infection. Blood density is about 1.05 kg/L, which means that 1 mL of blood is roughly equivalent 1050 mg. This conversion was taken into account to convert the number of parasites per mL of blood into number of parasites per mg of blood. Parasite quantification from gDNA was also undertaken using ΔΔCt method. Here T. brucei and Mouse 18S rDNA genes were quantified from total genomic DNA. The ratio of the two genes provided a relative parasite density. Given that trypanosomal gDNA can remain in circulation for up to 14 days, RNA qPCR was also used to quantify parasite load in tissues by calculating the ratio of T. brucei TbZFP3 transcript to mouse Gapdh transcript. RNA was extracted using TRIzol or TRIzol LS reagents (Life Technologies) and cDNA prepared with TaqMan® Reverse Transcription Reagents (Invitrogen). The primers used for amplification of TbZFP3 gene of T. brucei were 5’–CAGGGGAAACGCAAAACTAA–3’ and 5’–TGTCACCCCAACTGCATTCT–3’ and for mouse Gapdh gene were 5’–CAAGGAGTAAGAAACCCTGGACC–3’ and 5’– CGAGTTGGGATAGGGCCTCT–3’. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed on an ABI StepOnePlus real-time PCR machine and data was analyzed with the ABI StepOne software.   GFP Expression and Cell Cycle FACS Analysis To quantify and characterize stumpy population in blood and fat, blood was collected by heart puncture from mice infected for 4 or 6 days, while gonadal fat depot was collected only on day 6 post infection (day 4 yield is too low to obtain enough isolated parasites). Parasites from blood were isolated using a DEAE column (Taylor et al., 1974) and parasites from fat were isolated from gonadal depot by incubating the depot in HMI11 for up to 40 minutes (hemocytometer was used to score the number of released parasites with time). GFP-expression in isolated parasites was analyzed on a BD LSRFortessa™ cell analyzer and data processed using FlowJo.  Cell-cycle analysis was performed using propidium iodide or Vybrant DyeCycle violet. For propidium-iodide, cells were first washed in ice-cold 1X PBS and then fixed with ice-cold 100% ethanol. After a washing step in 1X PBS, 0.5 µL of propidium iodide and 0.5 µL of RNaseA were added per each million of isolated parasites and incubated for 30 minutes at 37ºC. Vybrant DyeCycle violet staining was used in live cells. Essentially, cell suspensions from both blood and fat were washed once in 1X Trypanosome Dilution Buffer (1X TDB). 0.5 µL of DyeCycle violet was added per each million of isolated parasites and incubated for 10 minutes at 37ºC. Intensities were measured with BD LSRFortessa™ cell analyzer.  RNA-Sequencing  Blood from mice infected for 4 days was collected by heart puncture, parasites were purified over a DEAE column (Taylor et al., 1974) and total RNA extracted using TRIzol LS reagent. Mice infected for 6 days were sacrificed and perfused as explained above. Gonadal fat depot was collected and immediately lysed using TRIzol reagent. RNA and cDNA library preparation essentially followed the protocol in (Pena et al., 2014). Samples were sequenced in an Illumina HiSeq2000 platform (EMBL and BGI). Sequenced reads were 100bp paired-end for day 6 fat samples A and B, and 52bp single-end for the remaining samples. Paired-end reads were preprocessed by discarding the second read of each mate-pair, and trimming the first read to 52bp. Sequenced read quality was assessed using the FASTQC quality control tool (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). The SolexaQA suite of programs (http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/485) (Cox et al., 2010) was used to trim raw reads to their longest contiguous segment above a PHRED quality threshold of 28, and reads smaller than 25 nucleotides long were discarded. Reads were mapped to the T. brucei TREU927 (TriTrypDB 8.0) and Mus musculus (GRCm38) genomes using Tophat 2 (REF: http://www.genomebiology.com /2013/14/4/R36/abstract) (Kim et al., 2013) with library type unstranded and the total number of reads mapped to each organism was assessed (Table S1). The number of reads mapped to each CDS was quantified in the R software environment using the function summarizeOverlaps from the GenomicAlignments (1.2.2). We found that approximately 0.1% of the reads could not be unambiguously assigned to the mouse or Trypanosome genome. To avoid a possible contamination of the Trypanosome differential expression results with reads originating from mouse RNA, all reads that mapped, uniquely or not, to the mouse genome were discarded for further analysis. Differential gene expression was analysed using DESeq2 (v1.6.3) (Anders and Huber, 2010), edgeR (v3.8.6) (Robinson et al., 2010) and baySeq (2.0.50) (Hardcastle and Kelly, 2010) from Bioconductor (v3.0). Genes were considered differentially expressed if they were detected by at least two of these three algorithms (P adjusted < 0.01). The ArrayExpress accession number for Lister427 culture parasites is E-MTAB-1715. Sequence data generated as part of this study have been submitted to the ArrayExpress database (EMBL-EBI) under accession number E-MTAB-4061.  Myristate Metabolic Labeling  To evaluate myristate incorporation and degradation by T. brucei, blood parasites were isolated using a DEAE column (Taylor et al., 1974) and fat parasites were isolated from gonadal depot by incubating it in lipid free 1X Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) for up to 40 minutes (hemocytometer was used to score the number of released parasites with time). MEM was chosen instead of HMI11 to ensure no external stimulus would be given to the parasites. After isolation, parasites were washed in MEM, resuspended in 1 mL of the same medium, placed in an open/vented tube and starved of fatty acids for 30 minutes while in a water bath at 37ºC with 100 rpm horizontal agitation. To the starved parasites, 200 µL of labeled myristate (D27-myristic acid, CDN) pre-coupled with fatty acids free BSA were added. This solution was obtained by adding 2x10-3g of labeled myristate dissolved in 40 µL 100% ethanol (that was left at room temperature for 20 minutes) to 2x10-3g of fatty acids free BSA dissolved in 960 µL of MEM (that was left at 60ºC for 20 minutes), after a short spin the supernatant was ready for use. Parasites were once again incubated in a water bath at 37ºC with 100 rpm horizontal agitation for a one hour period (pulse). After pulse, 450 µL of the cell suspension were washed in 1 mL 1X TDB, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and lyophilized in glass vials. The remaining parasites were centrifuged at 800 g for 5 minutes and re-suspended in 500 µL of MEM and 100 µL of HMI11. This cell suspension was incubated in a water bath at 37ºC with 100 rpm horizontal agitation for one hour (chase). Just as after pulse, cells were washed in 1X TDB and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and lyophilized in glass vials. After, samples were spiked with an internal standard fatty acid C17:0, Sigma (20 µL of 1 mM) and dried under nitrogen. Acid hydrolysis was conducted using constant boiling HCl 6 M (200 µL) vortexing/sonication followed by incubation for 16 hours at 110 ºC. After cooling, the samples were evaporated to dryness in a speedvac concentrator and dried twice more from 200 µL of methanol:water (1:1). The protonated fatty acids were extracted by partitioning between 500 µL of HCl 20 mM and 500 µL of ether, the aqueous phase was re-extracted with 500 µL of fresh ether and the combined ether phases were dried under nitrogen in a glass vial. These fatty acids were then converted to methyl esters (FAME), by adding diazomethane (3 x 20 µL aliquots) to the dried residue, while on ice. After 30 minutes samples were allowed to warm to room temperature and left to evaporate to dryness in a fume hood. The FAME products were dissolved in 10-20 µL of dichloromethane and 1-2 µL analyzed by GC-MS on a Agilent Technologies (GC-6890N, MS detector-5973) with a ZB-5 column (30 M x 25 mm x 25 mm, Phenomenex), with a temperature program of at 70 ºC for 10 minutes followed by a gradient to 220 ºC at 5 ºC /minute and held at 220ºC for a further 15 minutes. Mass spectra were acquired from 50-550 amu. The FAME and the β-oxidation metabolites were identified based upon retention time and their fragmentation spectra.  Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses were performed in the free software R: http://www.r-project.org. Statistically significant variation of body weight, food intake between infected and control mice and parasite density in multiple fat depots were determined by using Student’s unpaired t test. Statistically significant variation of parasite morphology was determined by Wilcoxon rank sum test. To define the uniformity of the outcome of the two different parasites quantification methods we fitted a Linear Mixed Effects Model (LME), using the nlme package in R, considering mice as random factors. The bias in parasite density and parasite load for fat relative to non-fat organs was also determined by fitting a linear mixed effect model, using the nlme package in R, considering mice as random factors.
