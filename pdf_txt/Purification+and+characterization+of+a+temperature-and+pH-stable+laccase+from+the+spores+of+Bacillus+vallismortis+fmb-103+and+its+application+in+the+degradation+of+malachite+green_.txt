Abstract:  As there is  scarce information on the characterization and application of bacterial laccases in 
fruit juice processing, this work was envisaged to purify and characterize an extracellular laccase 
secreted by Bacill us cereus  UV25 for evaluating its potential in the enrichment of fruit juices. Laccase 
was produced in submerged fermentation and purified to homogeneity with 14.73 -fold and 22.82 % 
recovery using gel filtration chromatography. Purified laccase was a monom eric protein of 25.3 kDa 
exhibiting K m and V max for guaiacol as 10.69 mM and 42.37 IU/L, respectively. It showed optimum 
activity at 70 ℃ and pH 4.2. It exhibited significant stability at 70 -80 ℃, pH 3.8 -4.8, and during storage , 
at 4℃. Laccase activity wa s enhanced by Mn2+, Mg2+, Cu2+, Na+, Ca2+, Tween 20, Tween 80, and Triton 
X-100 but inhibited by Fe2+, K+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Hg2+, Co2+, EDTA, SDS, sodium azide, cysteine, and β -
mercaptoethanol. It was stable at 4 ℃ for four weeks without any activity loss . Physico -chemical 
analysis of juices obtained from laccase -treated apple and mango fruit pulps showed an improvement 
in juice characteristics. The properties of this enzyme pose it a potential cand idate for biotechnological 
applications.

1. Introduction  
Laccases (Benzenediol: oxygen oxidoreductases; EC 1.10.3.2) are multicopper -
containing oxidases capable of oxidizing a wide range of phenolic and non -phenolic 
compounds with simultaneous reduction of mo lecular oxygen (as a final electron acceptor) to 
produce water as a by -product [1]. They are termed “green biocatalyst” as they use only oxygen 
to oxidize their substrates. Owing to their broad substrate specificity, these enzymes find 
diverse applicati ons, including paper pulping and bleaching, textile refining, dye 
decolorization, detoxification of industrial pollutants, biosensors, bioremediation, production 
of anti -cancerous drugs, food industry, pharmaceutical industry , etc. [2 -5]. Laccases have bee n 
found in plants, fungi, bacteria , and insects , where they perform different physiological 
functions. Fungal laccases have been used in most  studies because of their high redox potential . 
Still,  their long fermentation period and inability to with stand harsh conditions of temperature, 
pH and salt prevailing in the industry have hampered their use in several applications [1]. To 
overcome these challenges, it may be advantageous to use bacterial laccases owing to their 
shorter duration of produc tion, better stability at high temperatures and pH values, and

 suitability for genetic improvement , which are important for their biotechnological application 
[1,3,6,7].  
Several bacterial species from the genus Bacillus , Pseudomonas , Alcaligenes, Serratia , 
Streptomyces, etc., are known to produce laccases [8 -19]. Most bacterial laccases are either 
intracellular or spore confined, making  their industrial application unfeasible due to the higher 
cost of purification [8,20]. The bacteria -producing thermostable and salt -tolerant laccases have 
received considerable scientific attention for suitability in industry. It would be desirab le to 
search for such thermostable and salt -tolerant bacterial strains which could produce 
extracellular laccase for industrial applications. Extracellular enzymes are preferred for 
industrial applications due to their lower purification cost . Some biotechnological applications 
of enzymes, for example , in the food industry, exclusively require these in purified form. There 
are limited reports on the purification of extracellular laccases from bacterial species 
[8,9,13,15,21 ].  
Fruit juices are non -fermented beverages obtained by mechanically squeezing or 
macerating fruits. These are preferred by consumers owing to their nutritional and health -
promoting benefits. Apple and mango fruit juices are commonly consumed b y people, rich in 
micro -nutrients, fiber, and antioxidants , as well as their positive effects on human health. 
During storage, raw fruit juices may become turbid due to polysaccharides (cellulose, 
hemicellulose, and pectins), phenolics, and proteins leading to  reduced shelf -life and consumer 
acceptability [22]. Phenolic compounds present naturally in fruits provide nutritional and 
therapeutic benefits [23]  besides imparting color and taste to the juices [24]. However, 
excessive oxidation and polymerization reactions of the phenolic compounds in fruit juices 
result in unwanted changes in their organoleptic properties affecting the product quality and 
shelf -life [24]. Enzymatic browning is the most common color change , which varies  in 
magnitude depending on the concentration of polyphenols naturally present in these juices [24]. 
The polyphenols in fruit juices may form complexes with proteins resulting in turbidity, 
browning , and an unpleasant taste during storage [23]. Enzyme s are considered effective 
processing aids to improve fruit juices' yield, clarity, and stability  [25]. Laccase can be 
employed to clarify and stabilize  fruit juices by removing undesirable phenols responsible for 
browning and turbidity [26]. Mostly, fungal laccases have been used in fruit juice processing 
[26]. Exploiting bacterial strains producing extracellular laccases with desired characteristics 
for industrial application is likely  important to meet their commercial needs.  
In the present study, an extracellular thermostable laccase has been purified and 
characterized from moderately salt-tolerant Bacillus cereus UV25 . Its potential in the 
enrichment of apple and mango juices has been evaluated.  
2. Materials and Methods  
2.1. Bacterial strain.  
B. cereus  UV2 5 (Accession number: MH916571), used for purification of extracellular 
laccase, was isolated in our laboratory from soil contaminated with decaying wood using 
nutrient agar medium containing 0.1% guaiacol. The purified bacterial culture was grown and 
maintained on nutrient agar slants at 4 ℃.

 2.2. Production of extracellular laccase by B. cereus UV25.  
Laccase was produced from B. cereus  UV2 5 under optimized submerged fermentation 
(SmF) conditions using a modified Horikoshi medium comprising 5.0 g peptone, 5.0 g beef 
extract, 5.0 g yeast extract, 5.0 g KNO 3, 0.2g KH 2PO 4, 0.1g MgSO 4.7H 2O and 1.0 mL guaiacol 
in one liter of water, pH 7.0 . The culture filtrate was collected and centrifuged at 10,000 x g 
for 20 min at 4 ℃. The resulting clear supernatant (crude enzyme extract) was used to purify  
laccase.  
2.3. Laccase activity assay.  
Laccase activity was determined by following the method of Das et al.  [27]. The 
reaction mixture for laccase assay  containing 1.9 mL of 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.2), 
0.5 mL of 0.1 M guaiacol , and 0.1 mL enzyme was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Enzyme and 
substrate controls were run simultaneously. The absorbance of the resulting colored product in 
test, enzym e control , and substrate control tubes was measured against distilled water at 470 
nm in a Spectrophotometer. The absorbance values of enzyme and substrate controls were 
subtracted from the absorbance of the test. Each enzyme assay was carried out in dupli cates. 
The laccase activity was calculated using an extinction coefficient of 6740 M-1cm-1 and 
expressed in IU/L. One enzyme unit was defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the 
production of one µmol of colored product per min under specified enzyme as say conditions. 
Protein content in the culture supernatant and pooled fractions at every step of purification was 
estimated according to Lowry et al.  [28] using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard 
protein.  
2.4. Purification of laccase.  
Laccase was purified at 4 ℃ by gel filtration chromatography using Sephadex G -25 and 
Sephadex G -100. A glass column (30 cm x 2.6 cm) was packed with swollen  Sephadex G -25 
(Pharmacia) and equilibrated with 0.1M sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.0). The crude enzy me 
extract obtained from B. cereus  UV25 culture filtrates was loaded onto the top of the gel in the 
column and eluted with the above buffer at a flow rate of 30 mL/h. Fractions (3.0 mL each) 
were collected and analyzed for laccase activity using guaiacol a s substrate. The most active 
fractions were pooled, and the pooled fraction was analyzed for enzyme activity and protein 
content.  
The pooled enzyme fraction obtained from Sephadex G -25 was loaded on a column of 
Sephadex G -100 (82.6 cm x 1.6 cm) and eluted with 0.1M sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.0) at a 
flow rate of 15 mL/h. Fractions (3 mL each) were collected and analyzed for protein by 
recording their absorbance at 280 nm in a UV -VIS spectrophotometer. The protein -containing 
fractions were examined for laccase activity , and the most active fractions were pooled. The 
pooled fraction was analyzed for laccase activity and protein content (by Lowry’s method).      
2.5. Testing of enzyme purity and zymography.  
Enzyme homogeneity was tested by performing Native -PAGE [29]  and SDS -PAGE 
[30] using a 12% resolving polyacrylamide gel. Protein bands were stained with Coomassie 
brilliant blue R -250. Zymogram analysis was performed by Native -PAGE under non -
denaturing con ditions at 4 ℃ using a slightly modified method of Patel et al.  [31]. For https://doi.org/10.33263/LIANBS 124.144   
 https://nanobioletters.com/  4 of 18 
 zymography, the sample was not heated before loading. After electrophoresis, the gel was 
equilibrated in 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.0) and then transferred to the same buffer 
containing 5 mM ABTS and incubated in  the dark for 15 –30 min with gentle shaking until the 
appearance of green -colored bands. The appearance of green bands indicated laccase activity 
due to the oxidation of ABTS.  
2.6. Characterization of purified laccase.  
Purified laccase was characterized for its molecular weight (MW), the effect of pH, 
temperature, metal ions an d additives, kinetic parameters (K m and V max), and storage stability.  
2.6.1. Determination of molecular weight.  
The MW of laccase was determined by gel filtration through Sephadex G -100 and SDS -
PAGE. A column of Sephadex G -100 (95 cm × 0.8 cm), pre -equili brated with sodium acetate 
buffer (0.1 M, pH 4.0), was loaded with a mixture of gel filtration protein MW markers ( Sigma -
Aldrich, USA ) containing albumin (66 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), cytochrome C (12.4 
kDa) and aprotinin (6.5 kDa)  which were elut ed at a flow rate of 15 mL/h. Fractions of 3.0 mL 
each were collected, and their absorbance was read at 280 nm. A graph was plotted between 
A280 and the fraction number. T his graph was used to calculate each protein's elution volume 
(Ve) (volume of eluent from the point of injection into the column to the center of the elution 
peak) . The purified enzyme was also run through the column under identical conditions to 
determine its elution volume (Ve). A graph was plotted between V e/Vo on the x-axis and  log 
MW of the marker proteins on the y-axis to determine the MW of laccase.  
In SDS -PAGE, purified laccase and the standard ladder of protein broad range MW 
markers (205.9, 97.4, 66, 43, 29, 20.1, and 14.3 kDa) were resolved using a 12% gel. After 
electro phoresis, the gel was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R -250 and then destained to 
visualize the protein bands. The distance trave led by the tracking dye , as well as protein bands , 
was noted. The relative mobility (R m) of each protein band was determ ined as follows:  
𝑅𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒  𝑚𝑜𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦 = 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒  𝑚𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑑  𝑏𝑦 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑖𝑛  𝑏𝑎𝑛𝑑
𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒  𝑚𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑑  𝑏𝑦 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑘𝑖𝑛𝑔  𝑑𝑦𝑒 
A logarithmic plot between MW of the marker proteins versus the corresponding R m 
was used to estimate the MW of laccase.  
2.6.2. Effect of pH.  
The effect of pH on purified laccase was studied in terms of pH optimum and pH 
stability. The optimum pH of the reaction was determined by carrying out the enzyme assay 
over the pH range 3.8 -12.0 using 0.1M buffers of different pH viz. acetate buffer (pH 3.8 -6.0), 
phosphate buffer (pH 6.0 -8.0), Tris -HCl (pH 8.0 -9.0) and glycine -NaOH (pH 10.0 -12.0). 
Relative activity (%) was calculated concerning  the maximum activi ty taken as 100%.  A graph 
was plotted between pH on the x-axis and relative laccase activity (%) on the y-axis. The pH 
corresponding to the highest laccase activity was t he optimum . 
The pH stability of laccase was investigated by pre -incubating  an aliquot 0.50 mL of 
enzyme and 0.50 mL of 0.1M acetate buffer in the pH range 3.8 -5.0 in the absence of substrate 
for 6 h at room temperature followed by measurement of enzyme activity using the standard https://doi.org/10.33263/LIANBS 124.144   
 https://nanobioletters.com/  5 of 18 
 assay. A control was run simultaneously in which the enzyme was incubated with distilled 
water instead of a buffer. The residual enzyme activity at each pH value was calculated as a 
percent of the control. The pH stability profile of laccase was drawn between pH on the x-axis 
and residual activity (%) on  the y-axis. 
2.6.3. Effect of temperature.  
The effect of temperature on purified laccase was studied in terms of optimum 
temperature and thermal stability.  The optimum temperature of the reaction was determined by 
performing the enzyme assay at different temperatures ranging from 30 -80ºC. Relative activity 
(%) was calculated concerning  the maximum activity taken as 100%. A graph was plotted 
between the temperature on the x-axis and relative laccase activity (%) on the y-axis. The 
temperat ure corresponding to the highest laccase activity was taken as the optimum 
temperature.  
The thermal stability of purified laccase was investigated by pre -incubating the enzyme 
at different temperatures ranging from 37 –80 ºC for 6 h in the absence of the su bstrate , followed 
by determining  laccase activity using the standard assay. Residual enzyme activity at each 
temperature was calculated as the percent of the control in which the enzyme was not pre -
incubated. T he thermostability profile of the laccase was drawn between the temperature on 
the x-axis and residual activity (%) on the y-axis. 
2.6.4. Effects of metal ions and additives.  
The e ffect of various metal ions (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Hg2+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Zn2+, 
and Co2+) on purified laccase  was investigated by pre -incubating the enzyme (along with assay 
buffer) with each metal ion at a concentration of 1 mM for 10 min followed by addition of the 
substrate and incubation at 37 ℃ for 15 min under optimal assay conditions. Relative activity 
(%) was calculated concerning  the control in which no metal ion was added.  
Effect of various additives viz. EDTA, SDS, cysteine, sodium azide, β -
mercaptoethanol, Tween 20, Tween 80 , and Triton X 100 on the activity of purified laccase 
was assessed by pre -incubating the enzyme (along with assay buffer) with the tested compound 
followed by addition of substrate to the reaction mixture and incubated at 37 ℃ for 15 min 
under optimal assa y conditions. All the additives were added at a concentration of 1 mM, 
except Tween 20, Tween 80 , and Triton X -100, which were used at 1% (v/v) concentration. 
Relative activity (%) was determined concerning  the control lacking any additive .  
2.6.5. Determination of K m and V max. 
The activity of purified laccase was determined at different concentrations (2.5 to 40 
mM) of the substrate guaiacol. A Lineweaver -Burk plot (1/v vs 1/[S]) was then drawn to 
calculate the Km and V max of laccase.  
2.6.6. Storage stability of purified laccase.  
Purified laccase was kept at 4 °C in a refrigerator and room temperature for nine weeks. 
Samples were collected at different intervals to measure  enzyme activity using a standard assay 
mixture. Laccase activity was calculated as the percent of the initial activity at various time 
intervals during storage.  https://doi.org/10.33263/LIANBS 124.144

 2.7. Potential of B. cereus UV25 laccase in the enrichment of apple and mango fruit juices.  
Ripened apple ( Malus domestica Borkh .) and mango ( Mangifera indica  L.) fruits were 
purchased from the local market, washed thoroughly with water, peeled , and macerated using 
a blender to get a smooth textured homogeneous fruit pulp. Both the pulps were treate d with 
purified B. cereus UV25 laccase under pre -optimized conditions of enzyme dose (2.4 IU/gfp 
for apple and 1.6 IU/gfp for mango), incubation time (60 min) at 37 °C in a rotary shaker at 50 
rpm for slight mixing of the contents. The untreated pulp sampl es were run simultaneously as 
a control. After the desired incubation period, the enzyme was inactivated by heating the 
suspension in a boiling water bath for 5 min followed by cooling. The samples were filtered 
through 2 -4 layers of muslin cloth , and the filtrate was centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 10 min. 
The resulting supernatant (juice) was analyzed for physico chemical parameters viz. yield, 
clarity, reducing sugars, total phenols , and total soluble solids (TSS).  
Juice yield was determined by measuring the volume of the supernatant obtained after 
enzymatic treatment of pulp and expressed as % (volume of juice per 100 g of pulp). Percent 
transmittance (%T), measured at 650 nm against distilled water in a UV-Visible 
spectrophotometer (Systronics -2203, Indi a), was considered a measure of juice clarity. 
According to Miller [32], reducing sugars were estimated  using 3, 5 -dinitrosalicylic acid 
reagent and quantified from a standard curve of xylose (10 -100 μg). According to Lin and Tang 
[33], total phenols were determined  using gallic acid as standard and expressed as mg/100 g 
pulp as gallic acid equivalents. TSS was measured using Erma Hand refractometer and 
expressed as oBrix.  
3. Results and Discussion  
3.1. Purification of laccase.  
Extracellular laccase was purified to homogeneity from the culture filtrate of B. cereus  
UV25 by gel filtration through Sephadex G -25 and Sephadex G -100 columns. The results of 
laccase purification are summarized in Table 1. Crude laccase, produced from B. cereus  UV25 
under SmF conditions, showed a specific activity of 0.04 IU/ mg protein. After G -25 gel 
filtration chromatography, three fractions containing most of the laccase activity were 
combined , and this pooled fraction revealed a specific activity of 0.052 IU/mg protein with 
109.13 % recovery and 1.30 -fold purification. This enzyme fraction was further purified by 
Sephadex G -100 column chromatography , which displayed a single peak of enzyme activity 
and protein in the gel filtration profile (F igure 1). The fractions containing laccase activity were 
combined , and the pooled sample was examined for laccase activity and protein content. Its 
specific activity was calculated as 0.589 IU/mg protein with 22.82% recovery and 14.73 -fold 
overall purifica tion.

3.2. Testing of enzyme purity.  
The purified fraction obtained from Sephadex G -100 chromatography was checked for 
purity by native -PAGE and SDS -PAGE. The results of the native -PAGE analysis shown in 
Figure 2a revealed a single protein band (lane P) , indicating that it was pure. The activity 
staining of purified enzyme on native -PAGE using ABTS as substrate showed a single, green -
colored band (lane D) which coincided with the protein band of the purified enzyme in lane P , 
confirming the laccase identity. The crude enzyme (lane C) and Sephadex G -25 pooled fraction 
(lane G), which were co -electrophoresed along with the purified enzyme, revealed multiple 
bands rather than a single band indicating the removal of non -enzymatic proteins during 
purification. On SDS -PAGE, the purified enzyme also revealed a single protein band (Figure 
2b, lane P) , indicating that it was homogeneous.

 In the literature, the purification of bacterial laccases has been documented with varying 
recovery and overall fold purification using different techniques. An extracellular, thermo -
alkali -stable laccase was purified 2 8.46-fold with 13.34% yield from B. tequilensis  SN4 using 
60% acetone precipitation, Sephadex G -150 and DEAE -cellulose [8]. An extracellular 
thermos -alkali stable laccase was purified 12.16 -fold to homogeneity from Pseudomonas  sp. 
S2 [12]. A laccase from A. faecalis  was purified 3.8 -fold with 12% recovery using salt 
fractionation and ion -exchange chromatography [13]. A laccase from S. psammoticus was 
purified 12.1 -fold with 22.1% recovery using anion exchange and gel filtration 
chromatography [14] . The laccase produced from Bacillus  sp. NU2 was purified to 
homogeneity by 7.55 -fold and 2.38% recovery using ammonium sulfate precipitation, DEAE -
Sepharose , and Sephacryl S -200 [21]. Laccases were purified from B. aquimaris  AKRC02 [10] 
and B. vallismortis  fmb-103 [20] by 38.08 -fold and 15.2 -fold, respectively. Kaushik and 
Thakur [34] purified laccase from  Bacillus sp . by 6.6 -fold with 4% recovery using salt  
precipitation and ion -exchange chromatography. A laccase was purified 5.8 -fold, and 51.5% 
recovery from cyanobacteria using ultrafiltration, acetone precipitation, anion exchange , and 
gel filtration chromatography [35]. A laccase from Pseudomonas putida LUA15.1 mutant E4 
was purified 60 -fold with 8.09% yield using ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration , and 
ion exchange chromatography [36]. One -step purification of laccase using affinity 
chromatography with 68.2% yield and 99.8 -fold was rep orted from halophilic Aquisibacillus 
elongatus  [37].  
It is evident from the published reports that the yield (22.82%) and/or overall 
purification (14.73 -fold) of purified extracellular laccase from B. cereus  UV25 fell within the 
range of recovery and fold  purification reported from different bacteria. Moreover, laccase in 
this study was purified using only gel filtration , whereas most researchers have also employed 
ion-exchange chromatography. The purification of extracellular laccases at a larger scale is  
easier  and may lower  the cost of its application in industry.  
3.3. Characterization of purified laccase.  
3.3.1. Determination of molecular weight.  
It was determined through gel filtration chromatography and SDS -PAGE. In gel 
filtration, elution of purified laccase through a Sephadex G -100 column revealed a single peak 
of enzyme activity which overlapped with the protein peak. The elution volume of the  enzyme 
peak was noted to calculate the ratio of Ve/Vo , which was extrapolated to the standard curve 
of marker proteins. The MW of purified laccase , calculated from the standard graph plotted 
between Ve/Vo versus log MW of the marker proteins , was found  to be 25.3 kDa .  
In SDS -PAGE, p urified B. cereus UV25 laccase and co -electrophoresed standard MW 
protein markers resolved as separate bands (Figure 2b). The MW of purified laccase , calculated 
from the logarithmic plot between MW of the marker proteins versus the corresponding R m 
was found to be 25.3 kDa.  
The identical MW of purified laccase from B. cereus UV25 estimated from gel filtration 
chromatography and SDS -PAGE suggested that the enzyme was a monomeric protein 
consisting of a single polypeptide ch ain having a molecular mass of 25.3 kDa. This finding 
agrees with a majority of bacterial laccases, which wer e monomeric proteins with molecular 
mass ranging from 20 -80 kDa [1].  https://doi.org/10.33263/LIANBS 124.144   
 https://nanobioletters.com/  9 of 18 
 Purified  laccases from various bacterial strains have been reported to differ in their 
molecular mass. The MW of B. cereus  UV25 laccase is close to 29.8 kDa of recombinant 
laccase [38] but lower than that of other laccases , including 32 kDa of B. tequilensis  SN4 [ 8], 
33 kDa  of Bacillus  sp. A4 [39] and 34 kDa  of B. subtilis  [40],  38 kDa of B. licheniformis  
TPNR6 [9] , 43 kDa from S. psammoticus  [14], 55 kDa of Bacillus  sp. NU2 [21],  65 kDa from 
B. aquimaris AKRC02  [10], 70 kDa from Bacillus  sp. [34] , and 71 kDa from A. faecalis [13]. 
These variations may be related to either genetic makeup or physiological function.   
3.3.2. Determination of optimum pH.   
The activity of an enzyme is greatly influenced by pH , which can either change the 
ionization sta te of active site amino acids or alter  the enzyme conformational, thereby affecting 
its activity and  stability. The activity of purified B. cereus  UV25 laccase was measured using 
guaiacol  as substrate. Its pH -activity profile showed the optimum pH of the enzyme at 4.2 since 
the activity was highest at this pH (Figure 3a). This observation is in line with earlier reports 
which described the optimum pH range for working of bacterial laccases  as 3.0 -9.0 [1]. The 
acidic pH optimum in this study is similar to that reported for laccase purified from A. faecalis  
NYSO [41], B. licheniformis  TPNR1 [9], B. licheniformis  VNQ [18], cyanobacteria [42] and 
Bacillus sp . [41]. The optimum aci dic pH of laccase was at variance with several bacterial 
laccases , which have been shown to exhibit optimum activity at an alkaline pH range of 8.0-
9.0 [12 -14,21,42]. The optimum pH has been reported to vary for different substrates , which 
might be due to the difference in the redox potential of Type I copper of enzyme and the 
substrate [8].

 3.3.3. Determination of pH stability.  
The pH stability profile of purified laccase over a range of pH 3.8 -5.0 revealed the 
highest enzyme stability at pH 4.0 -4.2 upon pre -incubation for 2 h , followed by a decli ne on 
incubation for longer periods. The stability at a particular pH decreased with an increase in pre -
incubation time such that nearly 83.11% and 76.62% activity was recorded on incubation at 
pH 4.2 , whereas 77.27% and 67.23% activity was recovered after pre-incubation at pH 4.8 for 
4 h and 6 h, respectively (Figure 3b). So, the enzyme was stable at acidic pH values. Generally, 
fungal laccases are stable at acidic and neutral pH, but bacterial laccases exhibit stability at 
alkaline pH [43]. In previous rep orts, the pH stability of laccase has been found to vary amongst 
different bacterial strains. The pH stability of the laccase in this study was similar to the 
partially purified laccase from A. faecalis  NYSO , which was stable at pH 4.0 -5.0 [41]. Some 
lacca ses demonstrated stability over a broad pH range [20,37] or at alkaline pH values [13, 
44,45].  
3.3.4. Determination of optimum temperature.  
The activity profile of purified laccase at various temperatures revealed an increase in 
enzyme activity with a rise in temperature up to 70 °C followed by a decline at higher 
temperatures (Figure 3c). The enzyme showed 80.98 % relative activity at 80 °C, indicating that 
it could  catalyze its reaction at temperatures as high as 70 °C. The optimum temperature for 
purified B. cereus UV25 extracellular laccase was recorded at 70 ºC.  
Bacterial laccases have been found to work over a broad temper ature range of 30 -85 °C 
[1]. The optimum temperature of B. cereus  UV25 laccase was similar to that reported for 
laccases from B. licheniformis  [11] and Bacillus sp. SS4 [44] but higher than 40 °C of Bacillus  
sp. A4 [39 ], 50 °C of B. subtilis  [40], and B. licheniformis  TPNR1 [9], 55 °C of A. faecalis  
NYSO [41] and 60 °C of B. subtilis  X1 [46], and Bacillus  sp. NU2 [21]. In contrast, a higher 
optimum temperature for laccase has been recorded at 80 °C [9,10 ] and 85 °C [8].  
3.3.5. Thermo -stability.  
Thermo -stability profile of purified laccase from B. cereus  UV25 revealed significant 
stability over a temperature range of 37 -80℃ with a maximum of 70 ℃ (Figure 3d). Thermal 
stability was dependent on the pre -incubation time. The residual enzyme activity was 98.76% 
and 82.24% after 4 h and 6 h pre -incubation at 70℃, whereas the corresponding activity at 80 
℃ was 80.67% and 60.2%, respectively . The enzyme retained >90% and >80% of initial 
activity upon pre -incubation for 2 h and 4 h, respectively , over all the tested temperatures. At 
longer incubations, residual activity declined gradually. After 6 h of incubation, the residual 
activity  was recorded as 75.08 %, 79.93%, 82.24% , and 60.2% at 50, 60, 70 , and 80 ℃, 
respectively. Enzyme stability at high temperatures is one of the characteristics desirable for 
its industrial applications. Significant stability of B. cereus  UV25 laccase at high temperatures 
over a b road range of temperatures would be advantageous for its use in industry.  
The thermal stability of bacterial laccases has been found to vary in the literature. The 
thermo -stability of B. cereus  UV25 laccase was following  Singh et al.  [44], who reported that 
Bacillus sp. SS4 laccase exhibited the best working at 70 –80 ℃  retaining 90% activity at 70 ℃ 
after 5 h and 88% at 80 ℃  after 3 h. The Bacillus  sp. laccase showed a half-life of 23 min at 
75℃ [34]. The half -life of B. subtilis  X1 exceeded 6 h at 70 °C and was approximately 2.5 h https://doi.org/10.33263/LIANBS 124.144   
 https://nanobioletters.com/  11 of 18 
 at 80 °C [46]. The B. tequilensis  SN4 laccase retained more than 80% activity at 70 ℃  and was 
completely stable at 65 ℃  for 24 h [8]. Recombinant laccase from B. pumi lus retained 50.3% 
and 24.6% of original activity after 2 h of incubation at 70 ℃ and 80 ℃, respectively [43]. The 
laccase from B. vallismortis spores was found to retain more than 50% of the original activity 
after 10 h at 70 ℃ [20]. The B. licheniformis  TPNR 1 laccase exhibited a half -life of 4 h at 70 
℃ but retained 79% of original activity after 3 h at 60 ℃ [9]. The B. licheniformis  laccase 
displayed maximum stability at 50 ℃ and retained more than 85% of original activity at 60 ℃  
after 10 h [11]. The r elative activity of Bacillus  sp. A4 laccase  was observed at 81%, 65%, and 
51% at 60, 70, and 80 °C, respectively [39]. The A. elongatus laccase retained more than 80% 
of its original activity after 6 h incubation at 25 –75 °C [37]. Purified A. faecalis  laccase 
exhibited stability in the range of 70 -90 °C [10]. Some researchers have reported optimum 
stability of laccase at 45 ℃ for 8 h [10] and 50 ℃ for 90 min [14]. Afreen et al.  [35] showed 
optimum stability of laccase at 30 -40 ℃  and retained 85% and 54% activity at 50 and 60 ℃  
for 30 min, respectively.  
It is evident from the above reports that the thermal stability of B. cereus  UV25 laccase 
was higher than the enzymes purified from several bacterial species. The present findings on 
the effect of temperature revealed that the purified enzyme was active at higher temperatures 
(70-80 °C) and demonstrated considerable thermal stability at these temperatures,  implying it 
to be a thermostable enzyme. This observation is pertinent for the industrial application of the 
enzyme.  
3.3.6. Determination K m and V max.  
The Km and V max of the enzyme , as calculated from the double reciprocal plot , were 
found to be 10.69 mM and 42.37 IU/L , respectively , for guaiacol as substrate . In the literature, 
Km and V max values for laccase have been reported to vary depending on the source bacterial 
strain as well  as the substrate used for enzyme assay. In this study, the Km value for guaiacol 
was higher , and V max was lower than those reported earlier for purified bacterial laccases 
indicating a lower affinity of the enzyme [8,13,40].  
3.3.7. Effect of metal ions o n laccase activity.  
Metal ions are known to influence the activity of enzymes, including laccase, and may 
act as either activators or inhibitors of activity. These may affect the amino acid residues  at the 
active site and the exterior surface of an e nzyme, inducing alterations in its charge and 
distorting the structure. In the present study, the effects of metal ions viz. Ca2+, Hg2+, K+, Na+, 
Mn2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ were examined on the activity of purified laccase 
from B. cereus UV25. It was observed that the addition of  Ca2+, Na+, Mn2+, Mg2+, and Cu2+ in 
the enzyme assay stimulated the laccase activity by 15.87%, 33.08%, 55.32%, 45.08% , and 
71.16%, respectively whe reas the presence of Fe2+, K+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Hg2+, and Co2+ significantly 
reduced the enzyme activity by 71.84%, 69.40%, 46.51%, 37.70%, 27.70% , and 22.48%, 
respectively as compared with the control in which no metal ion was added in the assay (Table 
2).

           The values represent mean ± S.D. The control was devoid of metal ions.  
Among these metal ions, Cu2+ ions were the most effective activator , which could be 
due to the filling of type I copper binding site by these ions , thereby indicating their 
involvement in enzyme catalysis [47]. Activation of the enzyme by Na+ might be due to the 
salt tolerance characteristic of the bacterial strain. The decline in laccase activity by Fe2+ ions 
could be explained by their possible att achment to the copper types II and type III , thereby 
interfering with internal electron transfer reactions of the enzyme [8]. The inhibition by Hg2+ 
ions indicated their key role in laccase activity. These ions might alter the enzyme conformation 
by their ability to bind sulfhydryl groups , thereby suppressing the enzyme activity.   
Variations have been observed by researchers concerning  the effect of metal ions on 
bacterial laccase activity. In agreement with the results of the present study, the stimulatory 
effect of Cu2+, Na+, Mn2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ has been reported on the activity of bacterial laccase 
from [8, 12,13, 45]. Activation of laccase activity by Cu2+, Mn2+ and Zn2+ [35] and by Fe2+, 
Cu2+, Na+, Zn2+ and Mg2+ [14] has also been docu mented. It was found that laccase activity 
was enhanced by Cu2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Mg2+ and Cd2+ but inhibited by Fe2+ and Hg2+ [41]. 
Similar to the present findings, laccase activity was inhibited by Zn2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+ [8, 45] 
and by Fe2+ and Co2+ [43]. The inhibitory effect of Ni2+ and Fe2+ has also been recorded 
previously [8]. In contrast to the present findings, laccase from some bacteria was activated by 
Co2+ [8,12,41,45].   
3.3.8. Effects of additives on laccase activity.  
The interaction of a dditives with extracellular laccase is particularly important for a 
better understanding of the biotechnological processes. In the current work, it was noticed that 
EDTA, sodium azide, L -cysteine , and β -mercaptoethanol at 1 mM concentration were potent 
inhibitors of laccase suppressing the enzyme activity by 88.23%, 75.24%, 72.88% , and 14.18% 
(Table 3). Similarly, EDTA, sodium azide, L -cysteine, and β -mercaptoethanol were found to 
inhibit the activity of laccase from  B. tequilensis  SN4 [8] and B. pumilus  [43]. Abdelgalil et al.  
[41] also observed inhibition of laccase activity by β -mercaptoethanol, cysteine -HCl, 
thioglyco lic acid, sodium azide , and dithiothreitol but EDTA showed activation. Other 
researchers have also reported the inhibition of bacterial la ccase by EDTA, sodium azide , and 
dithiothreitol, although their concentrations might differ [11,39,42]. Singh et al.  [45] showed 
inhibition of laccase by azide, cysteine, thioglyco lic acid , and diethyldithiocarbamate.  
The significant inhibitory effect of EDTA might be due to the chelation of type I copper 
ions indicating the involvement of these ions in the catalytic reaction of laccase [34]. It was 
also likely that EDTA attached to type II copper ions facilitated their collection , causing further 
inhibition of laccase activity [48].  Sodium azide -mediated inhibition of laccase could be due 
to the binding of azide with the trinuclear copper center , thereby interfering with the electron 
transfer in type II and type III copper binding sites [39]. Cysteine is a competitive inhibitor of 
phenol oxidases , and hence it could bind to the active site of laccase , forming an enzyme -https://doi.org/10.33263/LIANBS 124.144   
 https://nanobioletters.com/  13 of 18 
 cysteine complex and causing a decrease in enzyme activity [49]. β -mercaptoethanol is a 
sulfhydryl compound that could reduce the oxidized substrate back to its r educed form with 
the help of their –SH groups resulting in the inhibition of laccase activity [8].  
The a ddition of non -ionic surfactants such as Tween 80, Tween 20 , and Triton X -100 
at a concentration of 1% (v/v) significantly enhanced the enzyme activity by 45.07%, 25.78% , 
and 33.80%, respectively. The stimulatory effect of surfactants was probably due to enzyme 
stabilization resulting from their interaction with laccase. An improvement in the stability of 
laccase by its interaction with Triton X -100 has also been shown earlier [48]. The binding of 
laccase to Triton X -100 also mitigated the inactivating effect of free radicals and 
polymerization products. The non -ionic surfactants probably stimulated laccase activity in the 
same manner. In this stu dy, SDS, an anionic surfactant, was found to inhibit enzyme activity 
by 82.71% , which is in line with the earlier reports on bacterial laccases [13,20,39,41]. 
However, Sondhi et al.  [8] observed stimulation of laccase activity by ionic surfactants at l ower 
concentrat ions but inhibition at higher concentrations.

3.3.9. Storage stability of purified laccase.  
The storage stability of purified laccase was assessed at 4 ºC an d room temperature for 
9 weeks at weekly intervals.  Purified laccase was found to be completely stable at 4 °C for four 
weeks , but a gradual decline in activity was recorded on further storage . After nine weeks of 
storage at 4 °C, the enzyme retained 69.8 7% starting activity (Table 4). At room temperature, 
the residual laccase activity remained unchanged during storage for three weeks , but after that , 
the activity showed a gradual reduction. The residual activity after nine weeks of storage was 
observed as 50.61%. The substantial storage stability of B. cereus UV25 laccase would likely 
be useful for its application.

 3.4. Potential of B. cereus UV25 laccase in the enrichment of apple and mango fruit juices.  
Before  juice extraction, treatment of apple pulp with B. cereus  UV25 laccase at the 
optimal dose (2.4 IU/gfp) for 60 min enhanced the yield, clarity, reducing sugars and TSS by 
9.52%, 27.27%, 58.89% , and 31.13 respectively while treatment of mango pulp with the 
optimal enzyme dose (1.6 IU/gfp) improved the above parameters by 11.86%, 27.25%, 
43.12% , and 15.08%, respectively as compared to the control. On the other hand, polyphenolic 
contents of apple and mango juices were reduced by 11.11% and 12.82%, respectively , after 
treatment of the fruit pulps with laccase (Figure 4a,b).  
The quantity of phenolic compounds in raw fruit juices affects the juice quality in terms 
of change s in color, aroma , and taste  during processing and storage. Laccase has immense 
potential to enhance  fruit juice color and flavor stabilization by removing undesirable phenols 
[26]. The decline in apple and mango juices' polyphenolic content after treatment of fruit pulps 
with B. cereus UV25 laccase was attributed to the enzyme -catalyzed oxidation of phenols, 
which  enhanced juice clarity. Several workers have recorded a decline in the phenol content of 
juices after adding laccase. The use of laccas e was found to be more effective in enhancing 
color and flavor stability compared to conventional treatments [50]. Ribeiro et al.  [51] 
documented a substantial decline in fruit juices' phenolic content and  enhanced color stability 
on treatm ent with laccase. Laccase treatment is usually followed by ultrafiltration. Ghosh and 
Ghosh [52] reported 26% and 36.3% drop in phenolic content along with a decrease in turbidity 
after treatment of apple juice with fungal laccase for 12 and 24 h, respecti vely. A n improvement 
in apple juice's clarity and sensory quality characteristics  has been reported on treatment with 
1% of purified fungal laccase [36]. Nadaroglu and Tasgin [53] pointed out that treating raw 
fruit material with  a high conc entration of phenolic compounds with laccase increased the juice 
output and reduced its phenolic content. They reported a 36.1% and  29.5% reduction  in 
phenolic compounds of apple and grape juices by using purified laccase from Lactarius 
volemus . Artik et al. [54] observed a 70% decrease in phenolic content along with an increase 
in the clarity of sour cherry juice after oxidation with laccase for 6 h at 50 ℃ , followed by 
filtration after 1 h. Neifer et al.  [55] recorded a 50% decline in total phenols and a 30% increase 
in pomegranate juice clarity and stability by combined laccase treatment (5 U/mL) and 
ultrafiltration.  
In contrast, an increase in polyphenolic content was noticed in pomegranate juice [56] 
after laccase treatment. A fungal laccase immobilized on low-cost coconut fibers has also been 
used for apple juice clarification [57]. The magnitude of the decline in phenolic content may 
vary with the number  of phenols in juices, enzyme characteristic s, dose, and starting material 
(fruit pulp or ju ice) used for enzymatic treatment.  
An increase in the juice yield upon enzymatic treatment of apple and mango fruit pulps 
observed in this study might be due to the removal of phenols attached to other pulp 
constituents of the fruit wall resulting in more juice releas e. The apple juice yield and clarity  
are also reported to increase after the  fruit pulp treatment  with bacterial xylanase [58,59]. 
Sharma et al.  [60] used fungal xylanase to enhance  the clarity of orange and mosambi juices. 
The observed increase in TSS along with reducing sugars following treatment of apple and 
mango fruit pulps with laccase might be to the greater degree of tissue breakdown in enzyme -
treated juice , releasing sugars add ed to soluble solids in juices. An increase in soluble solids in 
enzyme -treated juices was also recorded by other resea rchers [56].  https://doi.org/10.33263/LIANBS 124.144

 The results showing an improvement in physico chemical characteristics of apple and 
mango fruit juices after treatment of their pulps with B. cereus  UV25 laccase implied the 
potential of this bacterial enzyme in juice enrichment. However, thi s application requires 
detailed investigations.

purified  B. cereus  UV25 laccase.  
4. Conclusions  
An extracellular, thermostable , and moderately salt -tolerant laccase secreted in the 
culture filtrates by Bacillus cereus  UV25 has been purified to homogeneity employing only gel 
filtration chromatography. It is a monomeric protein of molecular weight 25.3 kDa. 
Considerable stability of this enzyme at high temperatures, acidic pH , and during storage , as 
well as modulation of its activity by metal ions, non -ionic surfactants, chelating agent s, and 
sulfhydryl compounds , can be exploited in biotechnological applications. Its capability in 
enriching  juices obtained from laccase -treated apple and mango fruit pulps has been 
demonstrated , but it needs further investigation.
