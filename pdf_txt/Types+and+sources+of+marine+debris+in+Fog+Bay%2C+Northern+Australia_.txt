Review 
Plastic ABSTRACT  
Marine debris, directly and indirectly, threatens marine habitat and biota. Fishing activity is generally recognised 
as a contributor to marine debris, but the relative input from recreational fishing remains unassessed. Here we 
provide the first comprehensive literature review of recreational fishing marine debris (RFMD) on a global scale. 
A systematic literature review identified 70 studies related to RFMD, and plastic and metal respectively were the 
dominant debris materials found. Nearshore coastal areas and reefs, acted as both sources and sinks of RFMD and 
a diverse suite of potential impacts such as ghost fishing and entanglement were identified at local scales. 
Overall, research of RFMD is lacking globally, however, its role in marine debris input is likely underestimated. 
We recommend more research on the volumes and risks, using a standardised classification approach. Where 
intervention is required, we suggest cooperative approaches between the sector and authorities.   
1.Introduction 
One of the greatest challenges of the Anthropocene is managing 
debris in the marine environment that originates from humans 
(Thompson et al., 2004 ). Marine debris, defined as discarded material 
present in the marine environment from anthropogenic sources (UNEP, 
2009 ), is comprised of a broad range of materials such as plastic, metal, 
wood and glass (Whiting, 1998 ). It enters the marine environment 
directly from land or from boats via dumping, accidental loss or aban-
donment of fishing gear, or indirectly through storm water or rivers 
(Katsanevakis, 2008 ). The marine debris problem is global in scale, 
intergenerational in impact and results principally from human behav -
iour (UNEP, 2012 ). The rate of accumulation of marine debris continues 
to increase (e.g. Watters et al., 2010 ), including increasing discard rates, 
particularly for plastic. It is now estimated that 8300 million metric tons 
of plastic have been produced by humans since the 1950s and, if this rate 
continues, 12,000 million metric tons are predicted to be in the natural 
environment by 2050 (Geyer et al., 2017 ). Additionally, marine debris 
has the potential to cause significant global economic impacts given it is 
expensive to remove, causes declines in fish stocks, inhibits the preser -
vation and recovery of threatened species, can damage or immobilise 
marine vessels, and can reduce tourism amenity (McIlgorm et al., 2011 ; 
Newman et al., 2015 ). It is thus in the interests of multiple stakeholders to prevent its entry into the marine environment. 
Marine debris poses considerable threats to marine organisms 
through both entanglement and ingestion, as well as facilitating the 
colonisation of invasive species and the spread of diseases including 
viruses (Gregory, 2009 ; Gall and Thompson, 2015 ; Wilcox et al., 2016 ; 
Geoghegan et al., 2018 ; Lamb et al., 2018 ). Interactions with debris can 
cause serious damage to individuals and populations by contributing to 
reproductive disruption, behavioural alterations, stress, disease and 
mortality (Jovanovi ˘c, 2017 ; Gall and Thompson, 2015 ). These effects 
can interact cumulatively with overfishing, human-induced climate 
change and habitat modification or destruction. 
The activity of commercial fishing is considered a significant 
contributor to marine debris (Jones, 1995 ). Abandoned, lost or other -
wise discarded commercial fishing gear is common, and the size, weight 
and depth of operation of much commercial gear makes it frequently 
difficult to remove from the marine environment (Jones, 1995 ; 
Richardson et al., 2019 ). Such gear is a growing concern for sustainable 
fisheries and healthy ecosystems because of its capture and entangle -
ment of marine organisms, referred to as ghost fishing (Jones, 1995 ; 
Wilcox et al., 2016 ; Azevedo-Santos et al., 2021 ; Goodman et al., 2021 ). 
It also potentially impacts human use of marine systems by creating 
navigation hazards (Gilman, 2015 ; Scheld et al., 2016 ).

2fishing activity is much less understood. Available information suggests 
that it is an emerging priority (Whiting, 1998 ; McPhee et al., 2002 ; Hong 
et al., 2013 ). Recreational fishing, defined here as fishing for pleasure, 
food or sport and not for sale, principally involves angling (use of hook 
and line), deployment of traps to target crabs and lobsters, and of nets to 
catch fish and smaller crustaceans, such as prawns. Although other 
forms of recreational fishing exist, such as spearfishing and gathering by 
hand, these were not reviewed here because they are less common ac-
tivities (Henry and Lyle, 2003 ) and unlikely to substantially contribute 
to fishing marine debris. Given that recreational fishers in almost all 
countries and the participants in many countries are numbered in the 
millions (Aas, 2008 ; Arlinghaus et al., 2021 ), recreational fishing marine 
debris (RFMD) has the potential to significantly contribute to the overall 
load of marine debris (Campbell et al., 2005 ). Recreational fishing is 
common in many countries and can reportedly have a greater ecological 
footprint than commercial fishing in several instances (McPhee et al., 
2002 ). While there is a consensus that the amount of anthropogenically 
derived marine debris poses substantial threats to economies and the 
marine environment, surprisingly little research is available on doc-
umenting and quantifying the input from recreational fishing activity. 
The primary aim of this systematic literature review was to synthesise 
knowledge about RFMD. A secondary aim was to determine whether 
sufficient knowledge was available to verify or dismiss the threats from 
RFMD to the environment. In doing this we needed to understand the 
types and volumes of RFMD that enter the marine environment and its 
fate (i.e. its sources, including the source locations, and sinks). We also 
needed to understand the threats to the environment from each of the 
various components of RFMD and potential interactions with marine 
habitats and biota. For context, we also needed to understand the rela-
tive contribution of the load of RFMD to the total output of marine 
debris. We identify where research gaps lie and whether it is possible to 
determine key target areas for management of RFMD. We examine 
global and local strategies that have been used to address RFMD and 
propose options for addressing gaps in knowledge and for managing 
identified threats. 2.Methods 
2.1. Search strategy 
Literature was searched in November 2019 using Scopus ™, Web of 
Science ™ and ScienceDirect ™ to locate scientific publications and grey 
literature on RFMD since 1965. These databases were searched using the 
key words [(recreational OR sport OR tournament) AND (fishing OR 
angling) AND (marine) AND (debris OR pollution OR litter)]. Web of 
Science ™ returned several thousand, mostly irrelevant results hence the 
search was refined by searching within results using the key words 
‘recreational ’ and ‘fishing ’. Articles that did not examine marine debris 
in any context were excluded. Marine debris studies with no inclusion of 
fishing related debris in either quantification or source identification 
were also excluded. Fishing debris cannot always be definitively cat-
egorised as commercial or recreational in origin without analysis of 
other factors such as region and water depth (GESAMP, 2021 ). There -
fore, only studies that specifically identified recreational or commercial 
origin were categorised as such for metric analysis, with others cat-
egorised as ‘fishing (unspecified) ’ (Fig. 1). Relevant studies were iden-
tified and tabulated based on paper type, study type, prominent debris 
material, prominent source of debris, location and more (Fig. 1 and 
Supplementary material, Table 1). Other information was also recorded 
(if given) including the methods used, duration of the study, season of 
data collection, geomorphology of sample area (i.e. beach, estuary, coral 
reef etc.) and location usage (i.e. fishing, tourism etc.). 
Metrics were then summarised in Microsoft Excel (Version 15.33). 
Additionally, study locations were mapped using Geolytics, a program 
allowing the placement of multiple location pins on a global map 
(GeoLytics, 2003 ). For context, the results of the systematic search 
above for RFMD were combined with key information on the general 
marine debris, such as overall loads and discard behaviours, and rec-
reation fishing sector.

Watson et al.

33.Results 
3.1. Overall trends in RFMD studies 
Seventy relevant studies were identified in the systematic search and 
were distributed globally, with the largest number of studies in 
Australia, the Mediterranean and the USA (Fig. 2 and Supplementary 
material, Table 1). The area covered by the 70 studies was highly vari-
able with some quantitative studies sampling at F100 sites, while others 
sampled at only a single location. Of the relevant studies identified, 11 
were highly specific to RFMD as opposed to general marine debris. 
Limited literature on marine debris was available prior to the early 
2000s, with output in this field of research increasing around 2008 
(Fig. 3). A large proportion of the literature to date are empirical studies 
(i.e. field studies) (Fig. 3). 
Eight study types were identified in the search: economic pre-
dictions, gear analysis, meta-analysis, policy, social impact, quantifica -
tion, impact and quantification/impact (Fig. 4). Thirty-six studies were 
categorised as quantification studies due to their examination of the 
abundance, weight and/or density of marine debris in various locations. 
3.2. Quantitative studies 
Quantitative RFMD studies used a variety of methods (Supplemen -
tary material, Table 1). Shore surveys, which included beach clean-ups, 
shoreline transects and quadrats, were the most common methods used for quantifying marine debris (Fig. 5). Underwater surveys were also 
frequently used, utilising SCUBA, snorkel and manned submersibles. 
Several studies used a combination of methods such as SCUBA surveys 
paired with manned submersible or image mapping to maximise chan-
ces of detecting debris present. 
Within the 43 quantitative (quantification and quantification/ 
impact) studies reviewed on RFMD, 25 studies identified the main 
source of debris. Overall, debris associated with fishing prevailed as the 
main source of debris, however, many studies could not discriminate 
recreational from commercial fishing debris (Fig. 6). Debris originating 
from general waste and specific recreational activities, such as tourism 
and picnics, was also reported in many studies, and in some was the 
main source of debris (Supplementary material, Table 1). 
Plastic was the most abundant material found in those studies that 
characterised the type of material (Fig. 7). Plastic debris comprised a 
range of items, including monofilament fishing line, food packaging, 
cigarette butts and plastic bags. 
3.3. Potential sources of RFMD 
RFMD may consist of materials specifically related to the act of 
fishing, such as bait containers, fishing gears and terminal tackle, or 
ubiquitous materials, such as food wrappers, drinking containers, etc., 
which can be associated with the act of fishing but may also originate 
from other activities. The potential for creating RFMD varies based on 
the fishing activity, target species and the type of coastal habitat in

Watson et al.

4which it is undertaken. Although this review focused on RFMD, it is also 
important to recognise the contribution of general waste on marine 
debris. Many people undertaking general every-day activities incor -
rectly or accidentally dispose of general waste. For example, in an 
Australia-wide study, 23% of people were observed to litter (i.e. to 
dispose of their rubbish inappropriately), with most littering occurring 
within five metres of a bin (Williams et al., 1997 ). 
3.3.1. Fishing gear and effort 
Globally, while participation rates in recreational fishing are falling 
across developed countries, increasing population sizes are leading to 
more participants overall (Loomis and Ditton, 1988 ; Arlinghaus, 2006 ; 
Arlinghaus et al., 2015 ). Factors influencing participation rates include physical and economic constraints, changing demographics and various 
other social issues (Arlinghaus et al., 2015, 2021 ). The global increase in 
the number of participants has implications for the volume of RFMD. 
While recreational fishing is geographically widespread, fishing effort is 
generally highly concentrated in locations that are relatively easy to 
access and that provide appropriate habitat for target species (Caddy 
and Carocci, 1999 ; Bucher, 2006 ; Smallwood et al., 2006 ; Ochwada- 
Doyle et al., 2014 ; Lynch, 2006 ; Griffin et al., 2021 ). Most marine rec-
reational fishing occurs in estuaries or coastal areas and embayments 
that provide protection from prevailing weather. Such areas are more 
accessible than areas distal from the coast (West et al., 2015 ). Recrea -
tional fishing can also be aggregated around artificial reefs and/or Fish 
Aggregating Devices (FADs) that aim to increase productivity and

5aggregate target species (Brickhill et al., 2005 ; Folpp and Lowry, 2006 ). 
The most common form of recreational fishing is angling, which is 
done with a rod, reel, line and terminal tackle. In Australia, Henry and 
Lyle (2003) estimated line fishing methods (bait, lure, jig, fly, setline) 
accounted for 85% of total fishing activity. The importance of angling as 
a form of recreational fishing activity is likely to be similar in other parts 
of the world. 
Fishing line consists of two main types: monofilament, which is 
usually extruded nylon; and braided lines made from multiple strands of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). A variety of 
different breaking strains of fishing lines are used. Terminal tackle in-
cludes sinkers, floats, hooks, swivels and lures. Lures are often used 
instead of bait and may consist of hard-bodied or soft-bodied structures. 
The latter consists of a lead jig with a soft plastic body that can be easily 
damaged/separated by a fish's bite or from snagging. The exact nature of 
terminal tackle is influenced by the target species and habitat. Recrea -
tional fishers also purchase bait or terminal tackle in plastic bags or 
containers. 
Terminal tackle may be cast out over the water where it sinks onto 
the seabed, cast and retrieved with bait or lure targeting surface fish, or 
kept close to the surface with the aid of a float, depending on the species 
targeted. Such tackle can break off the main line when a fish is hooked or 
when the line becomes entangled (“snagged ”) on the seabed or other 
structures. Some floats (e.g. balloons) are designed specifically to break 
off the main line when a fish is hooked. These balloons then typically 
remain on or in the water. 
Various types of traps and nets are used by recreational fishers, 
including those that can be: set in position to enclose or entangle; 
hauled; cast; or used to scoop up fish or crustaceans. Modern nets are 
typically constructed from synthetic fibres, such as monofilament nylon 
or multiple twisted or braided polymer filaments. The top edge of nets is 
sometimes attached to a rope called the headline, floatline or corkline. 
Floats of various material (generally polystyrene or cork) are attached to 
the headline to provide buoyancy. Recreational traps and nets have the 
potential for ghost fishing – i.e. they continue to catch animals after they 
have been lost and thus contribute to fisheries mortality (Campbell and 
Sumpton, 2009 ; Anderson and Alford, 2014 ). 
3.3.2. Loss rates of fishing gear 
Studies on loss rates of recreational fishing gear are rare. The only 
quantitative study that we know of from the systematic search was by 
Broadhurst and Millar (2017) who investigated breakage rates and 
twine loss for various configurations of recreational crab hoop nets in 
Australia. Their study showed that irrespective of configuration, con-
ventional multifilament polyamide twine hoop nets consistently pro-
duced marine debris —the extent of which substantially varied 
according to several biological (i.e. the species targeted) and environ -
mental (i.e. water temperature, salinity and diel deployment) factors. 
They estimated the total annual twine loss in the state of New South 
Wales (NSW), Australia, to be ~25,000 m and 400 m when targeting 
mud crabs (Scylla serrata ) and blue swimmer crabs (Portunus pelagicus ), 
respectively. The difference in twine loss between species was attributed 
to differences in size and aggression of S. serrata relative to P. pelagicus . A 
more recent study by Broadhurst and Millar (2020) found that while all 
types of hoops lost some twine, twine loss was the greatest with multi -
filament hoop nets, followed by multi-monofilament and then mono -
filament. All hoop nets caught the same number of S. serrata irrespective 
of soak time or twine type. The authors suggest that switching from 
multifilament to monofilament hoop nets while targeting S. serrata is a 
practical method to reduce marine debris without impacting catch. 
Commercial fishers also use lines, traps and nets, and studies of 
abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded commercial fishing gear provide 
a guide to potential loss rates that could be expected for recreational 
fishing gear. It is difficult to say whether loss rates for recreational 
fishing gear would be greater or less than commercial fishing gear. 
Recreational fishing gear is generally less robust than commercial fish-
ing gear meaning that the frequencies of breakages are potentially 
greater than for commercial gear. Further, given most recreational 
fishers would be expected to be less adept (at fishing) than commercial 
(professional) fishers, this would likely contribute to a greater risk of 
breakage or subsequent loss of gear (i.e. fishing on unfamiliar ground or 
with inadequate equipment for the bottom type or range of species that 
could be hooked). On the other hand, commercial fishers are likely to be 
more risk averse because their livelihood depends on catch and they 
generally operate in more extreme conditions than recreational fishers

6(i.e. in deeper areas with stronger currents) and leave gear unattended 
for longer periods. Notwithstanding these differences, Richardson et al. 
(2019) estimated that, worldwide, each year 5.7% of commercial fishing 
nets, 8.6% of traps, and 29% of lines are lost. Of the lines, predicted 
losses were 23% for handlines, 65% for pole-lines, 20% for longlines, 
including 17% loss for hooks from longlines and 22% for trolling lines. 
Their review also indicated that loss rates were variable and depended 
on gear characteristics, operational aspects and environmental contexts. 
Studies of commercial gear loss discussed in Richardson et al. (2019) 
indicated that snagging on bottom obstructions was a major cause of 
gear loss and it is not unreasonable to assume that the same would apply 
to recreational fishing gear. The reviewers speculated that while line 
losses were great, these likely comprised of a mix of entire gears and 
fragments due to breakage. In contrast, while trap and net losses were 
less, these losses likely comprised of entire gears. Fisher behaviour and 
effort are also important factors affecting rates of gear loss. Increased 
fishing effort has the potential to result in gear conflicts arising from 
overcrowding, increased competition and risk-taking behaviours among 
fishers, and this can be a factor that drives losses of fishing gear (Mac-
fadyen et al., 2009 ; Richardson et al., 2019 . 
3.4. Levels, loads and sinks of RFMD 
3.4.1. Incorrect disposal of waste 
In this review, incorrectly disposed non-fishing material refers to 
discarded packaging (e.g. from food, drinks or fishing gear), cigarette 
butts, etc. Many studies consider this to be generated from land-based 
activities but in many cases, it is difficult to distinguish between land- 
and boat-based sources such as commercial or recreational fishing or 
shipping (Koutsodendris et al., 2008 ). One study in Greece found that 
the proportion of anthropogenic debris collected on beaches attributed 
to fisheries and aquaculture ranged from 4.6% to 10.2% (Prevenios 
et al., 2018 ). An Australian study identified a positive correlation be-
tween general litter on beaches and the number of recreational boats, 
most of which were undertaking recreational fishing (Widmer, 2002 ). In 
another study of debris loads in coastal areas of eastern Australia, sites 
that had the highest loads of general marine debris (Nambucca River 
Estuary and the Pipeline, Port Stephens) were popular shore-based 
recreational fishing locations (Smith and Edgar, 2014 ). 
Despite these correlations, no studies have successfully differentiated 
incorrectly disposed non-fishing material (e.g. drink containers, food- 
wrappings, etc.) from recreational fishing activities to that from gen-
eral every-day activities. It is plausible that the potential amount of 
incorrectly disposed non-fishing waste associated with recreational 
fishing is similar to that of the general public. This is reasonable given 
that the rates of incorrect disposal of wastes at public waterside areas (i. 
e. beaches and waterways) are similar to those for roads and residential 
and industrial areas (Cutter et al., 1991 ). A study in Cape Town, South 
Africa quantified the amount of waste that reached the drainage systems 
and was carried into aquatic environments to be as high as 111 kg ha 1 
yr 1 (Marais et al., 2004 ). Thus, an important distinction should be 
made between unintended loss of fishing equipment (e.g. line breakage) 
and inappropriate disposal of waste by recreational fishers. Notwith -
standing this distinction, recreational fishers may be inclined to be more 
aware of and show greater affinity for the environment with respect to 
waste disposal because of their direct interaction with the environment 
(Browne et al., 2012 ). 
Review of the composition of anthropogenic debris in marine regions 
showed that plastics make up the largest proportion of overall litter 
pollution (Galgani et al., 2015 ). This reflects studies of land-based 
anthropogenic debris in non-marine regions. For example, the major -
ity of incorrectly disposed rubbish collected in a study in New Jersey, 
USA were cigarette butts (Cutter et al., 1991 ) of which the filtration 
material is cellulose acetate, a plastic. This was a trend in most public 
areas, including beaches and waterways (Cutter et al., 1991 ). In another 
study, the proportion of participants who incorrectly disposed of cigarette butts was also the highest of all other types of litter (57%) 
(Schultz et al., 2013 ). 
3.4.2. Loads of lost or discarded fishing gear 
Line, rope, net and plastic fragments are the most common types of 
fishing-related debris found in the RFMD studies, with much of the 
monofilament line being derived from recreational fishing (Supple -
mentary material, Table 1). 
The first published study that directly reported the contribution and 
characterisation of RFMD load was by Bauer et al. (2008) who used 
scuba-based surveys to assess fishing debris within a popular recrea -
tional fishing area. They attributed 68% of debris to fishing activity. 
Despite not differentiating between possible commercial and recrea -
tional debris, it is likely that most of the fishing debris originated from 
recreational fishers as commercial fishing was restricted in the area. This 
study did not report volume of debris types, rather percentages of total 
debris and frequencies of debris within sampling areas, making it diffi-
cult to determine the gross volume of debris present. Of the 93 items of 
debris identified, 63 were from fishing gear: 31 fishing line, 10 leaders, 
one spear gun part and 21 non-descript or other gear items (Bauer et al., 
2008 ). Other studies have also sourced debris from recreational fishing 
but did not, however, strongly justify their isolation from commercial 
sources or suggest their relative contributions (Anderson and Alford, 
2014 ; Bo et al., 2014 ; García-Rivera et al., 2017 ). 
Despite plastic, line and netting appearing as the most abundant 
material in a large proportion of the literature, other materials such as 
lead sinkers exceed plastic loads in some areas. Two studies reported 
that lead sinkers dominated in the proportion of marine debris items 
found (Lloret et al., 2014 ; Farias et al., 2018 ). Over a three-year survey 
of coastal Spain, lead sinkers constituted 36% of the total number of 
debris items found, however, line debris was not evaluated for logistical 
reasons (Lloret et al., 2014 ). The study reported the total weight of 
sinkers retrieved per year: 38.46 Kg in 2010, 67.34 Kg in 2011 and 3.9 
Kg in 2012 (Lloret et al., 2014 ). A similar short-term survey in a portion 
of an estuary in southern Brazil, collected 1752 lead sinkers (83% of 
total debris) weighing 50 Kg (Farias et al., 2018 ). In addition, 98% of the 
total marine debris found was attributed to local recreational and arti-
sanal fishing activities, highlighting the relative importance of recrea -
tional fishing to debris load in the area (Farias et al., 2018 ). Overall, 
artisanal fishing had by far the greatest contribution to the number of 
sinkers, however, it was limited to one area of the study region as 
opposed to those from recreational fishing which were identified in 
three of the four areas (Farias et al., 2018 ). 
RFMD appears to be accumulating in aquatic systems over time. A 
15-year study off coastal California found the volume of marine debris 
increased over the study period (Watters et al., 2010 ). While Watters 
et al. (2010) report debris as ‘density ’ (number of items/100 m), making 
quantities difficult to discern, they documented recreational fishing to 
be the source of the majority of the marine debris in the 1990s (92%) 
and 2007 (93%), with the debris being almost entirely monofilament 
line (Watters et al., 2010 ). This result is consistent with another study in 
the same region that found monofilament line from recreational fishing 
sources to be the predominant type of debris (Love et al., 2010 ). In 
contrast, a study in New Jersey, USA, identified crab traps from recre -
ational fishing origin as the primary recreational fishing debris, consti -
tuting 7% of marine debris over a four-year period (Sullivan et al., 
2019 ). 
Debris load and items recorded may be influenced by the methods 
used to quantify such debris. As opposed to the above studies that use 
marine based surveys, Yorio et al. (2014) and Hardesty et al. (2017) used 
a more traditional beach survey methodology to quantify RFMD. In a 
protected area of coastal Argentina, 55% of marine debris resulted from 
recreational fishing and was composed predominantly of 243 balls of 
tangled monofilament line (Yorio et al., 2014 ). In a beach survey of 
debris at a continental scale around Australia, only 2% of total debris 
was attributable to recreational fishing, although much of the plastic A.R. Watson et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Marine Pollution Bulletin 178 (2022) 113500
7debris was unidentifiable (Hardesty et al., 2017 ). Importantly, beach 
surveys may be biased in the types of debris found, as heavier items such 
as sinkers may remain in the water. Hardesty et al. (2017) represents the 
only peer reviewed study available that quantifies recreational fishing 
debris in Australia. Other studies report more general volumes of marine 
debris in the Australian Environment (Kiessling, 2003 ; Edyvane et al., 
2004 ; Smith and Edgar, 2014 ). 
Overall in the RFMD studies identified, the most abundant debris 
materials were plastic and metal (Supplementary material, Table 1). 
This is consistent with general global marine debris estimates where 
plastic dominates (Derraik, 2002 ). In particular, for RFMD, fishing line 
(predominantly monofilament) and sinkers dominated debris type. 
3.4.3. RFMD component breakdown 
Given recreational fishing activity is concentrated in coastal marine 
systems (Section 3.3.1 ), these areas include hotspots for both sources 
and sinks of RFMD. RFMD potentially enters the environment as intact 
or fragmented items (Section 3.3.2 and Fig. 8) and tend to break down 
further once in the system. Such fragmentation differs depending on the 
composition of the debris. Intact items are exposed to chemical and 
mechanical forces that facilitate breakdown (Cooper and Corcoran, 
2010 ). Fractures, notches, flakes, pits, grooves and vermiculate textures 
provide loci for chemical weathering that further weaken polymer sur-
faces. Plastic pieces can break down into ‘microplastics ’ defined by 
many in the scientific community as plastic particles from a few microns 
to 500 μm in size (Ng and Obbard, 2006 ; Barnes et al., 2009 ; Andrady, 
2011 ). Metal debris can breakdown on the seabed from weathering and 
chemical dissolution, releasing ionic metals into sediments and the 
water column (Schroeder, 2010 ). Breakdown of metals can also occur 
following ingestion by marine fauna. Birds that ingest grit to aid 
digestion have ground lead objects (e.g. sinkers or jigs) into smaller 
particles or ionic lead before releasing them back into the environment 
(Scheuhammer, 2009 ; Schroeder, 2010 ). Organic materials, such as 
wood, can become part of the natural nutrient cycle, feeding fungal and 
bacterial colonies and marine crustaceans (Alias and Jones, 2000 ; 
Maylon, 2011 ). Microorganisms and biofilms play a role in the disso -
lution of glass (Brehm et al., 2005 ). 
Corrosion time differs on recreational fishing gear depending on its composition. Stainless steel hooks are more corrosion-resistant than 
hooks made from other metal alloys. Most fishing hooks are made of 
high‑carbon steel and these are generally tougher than stainless steel 
hooks and do rust. The rate of rusting depends on their plating. Coatings 
vary from bronze varieties, which offer little corrosion resistance, to 
those that contain more protective elements like nickel, zinc, tin and 
lacquer. Edappazham et al. (2008) evaluated the corrosion resistance of 
two common surface finishes, tinned and blued, applied to fishing 
hooks. Exposure of the hooks to 300 h of salt spray resulted in an 
appreciable weight loss, with the tinned hooks incurring a loss of 5.37% 
from the initial weight and blued hooks losing 20.54% of initial weight. 
In saltwater, therefore, even the most basic plated hooks could last for 
months before significant corrosion occurs. Stainless hooks would keep 
their integrity much longer and thus have greater potential for continual 
impacts after breaking off with other terminal tackle. 
The breakdown time of some marine debris is largely unknown but 
also differs depending on composition. Metal debris deposited in aquatic 
sediments can take tens or hundreds of years before dissolution 
(Schroeder, 2010 ) while the breakdown of plastics is estimated in the 
order of hundreds of years (Kershaw et al., 2011 ). Some materials have 
greater potential for fragmentation than others. Among plastics, poly-
ethylene more readily degrades than polypropylene (Cooper and Cor-
coran, 2010). Some plastics are degraded by ultraviolet (UV) radiation 
(i.e. polyethylene and polypropylene) and the integration of UV stabil -
ising agents to extend the life of these plastics has made these more 
difficult to breakdown (Kershaw et al., 2011). Plastics on or close to the 
water surface are more exposed to this process than those at depth as 
seawater absorbs and scatters UV. 
3.4.4. Sinks for RFMD 
There are consistent patterns in areas that act as sinks for macro- 
RFMD. Most debris occurs at ledges on the seafloor, and aggregates in 
areas where boating intensity is highest (Bauer et al., 2008 ), or 
concentrated in shallow regions with rugged bathymetry (Cardno, 2007 ; 
Love et al., 2010 ). Macro-debris was associated more with rocky sub-
stratum than cobble or sand in coastal California (Watters et al., 2010 ). 
These sinks are presumably a result of RFMD entanglement then passive 
accumulation on areas with raised bathymetric features, however, it is

Marine Pollution Bulletin 178 (2022) 113500
8also proposed that that fishers deliberately target these areas more 
frequently (Bauer et al., 2008 ). 
Given marine recreational fishing occurs predominantly in coastal 
areas such as estuaries and bays, much debris from recreational fishing is 
likely to remain in these systems due to the limited hydrodynamic 
processes in these areas compared with further offshore (Katsanevakis, 
2008 ). This has been supported by a greater abundance of marine debris 
observed in bays as opposed to open coast in some areas (Katsanevakis, 
2008 ). An Australian study examined 120 coastal marine sites for ma-
rine debris and found that estuarine habitats and embayments were the 
most contaminated with debris (Smith and Edgar, 2014 ). Fishing related 
debris dominated the majority of sites providing support for the source 
and sink of recreational fishing debris in these areas. However, many 
studies on marine debris, and the majority identified on RFMD, have 
been conducted in coastal regions introducing a potential bias to this 
coastally concentrated pattern of debris (Fig. 2), and smaller and more 
lightweight items such as fragments of line or plastic bags have the 
potential to be more readily transported away from these sinks. 
More generally, highly populated coastal areas, off-shore canyons, 
enclosed bays, popular beaches (see Section 3.4.1 ) and current-based 
accumulation zones such as gyres, may act as sinks for marine debris 
(Galgani et al., 2015 ). Plastics have been found in even the most remote 
parts of the Arctic and Antarctic oceans and microplastics in particular 
(particles 5 mm in size, see Masura et al., 2015 ) have been identified in 
every marine habitat (Ivar do Sul and Costa, 2014 ). Ingestion of debris, 
such as microplastics, may act as a vector of transport to other sinks, 
however, this is unlikely to be occurring in substantial quantities. 
3.5. Impacts on habitat and biota 
Continual input of marine debris into the ocean poses a persistent 
threat to marine and coastal habitats and biota (National Research 
Council, 2008 ). Impacts of RFMD on habitats or organisms are depen -
dent on the volume and type of marine debris, along with the source and 
sink. 
RFMD can directly impact on organisms through entanglement, 
external injury and ingestion, all of which can lead to mortality. Netting, 
rope and line can entangle wildlife restricting their movement and may 
lead to strangulation or long term constriction injuries. Similarly, 
external injuries such as puncture wounds from hooks can impact an 
organisms' ability to move or feed. Marine debris can also be confused 
with prey species and ingested by marine wildlife, causing a physical 
blockage in digestive systems and lead to internal injuries and ultimately 
starvation (Valente et al., 2007 ; Pedˇa et al., 2016 ; Jovanovi ˘c, 2017 ; 
Otway et al., 2021 ). Smaller debris may also be consumed uninten -
tionally and the presence of such debris in marine organisms is ubiqui -
tous and concerning. 
RFMD also pose indirect consequences to marine organisms, how-
ever, these are difficult to quantify. Plastic debris can facilitate the in-
vasion of invasive or non-native species to new regions through rafting 
(Gregory, 2009 ). Involvement of recreational fishing debris in this 
process is likely minimal, however, as much of the debris is likely to 
remain in relatively isolated coastal systems. Indirect impacts also 
include the alteration of habitat which may lead to ecological changes to 
system and behavioural changes among organisms. 
3.5.1. Plastics 
Much of the researched impacts of marine debris are focused on 
plastics due to the known risks they pose to organisms. Plastics are not 
considered to ‘biodegrade ’ in the marine environment as the biode -
gradability or oxy-degradability of plastics in industrial composters or 
landfill are linked to a temperature consistently exceeding 58 •C (Song 
et al., 2009 ). Thus, many plastics remain suspended in the water column 
and ultimately are sequestered into benthic habitat for substantial pe-
riods of time, increasing risk to organisms across a broad range of marine 
environments. Plastic represented the most abundant material found in the RFMD quantitative studies by a large margin (Fig. 7). Plastic-based 
materials associated with RFMD showed line and net to display the 
greatest impacts on marine organisms in most areas (Dau et al., 2009 ; 
Anderson and Alford, 2014 ; Bo et al., 2014 ; Franco-Trecu et al., 2017 ). 
Expanded polystyrene foam (EPS) used for fishing floats is also pervasive 
in the marine environment, however, with high impacts to marine fauna 
(Derraik, 2002 ). 
Impacts from plastics associated with RFMD are well documented 
over time. Entanglement of marine life in fishing debris, most often by 
plastic line or netting, has been reported for decades (Gregory, 2009 ). 
Lost or abandoned fishing gear has the capacity to retain its integrity for 
some time and continue to fish and trap animals, a phenomenon coined 
ghost fishing. While most of the research on ghost fishing has focused on 
impacts of commercial fishing gear such as long-lines, gill and trammel 
nets (Kaiser et al., 1996 ), it can be assumed that monofilament lines and 
nets derived from recreational fishing activities will have impact in a 
similar manner. For example, a study in a New Jersey estuary found that 
47% of derelict fishing gear contained trapped macrorganisms, such as 
fish, crustaceans and molluscs, at the time of sampling indicating sub-
stantial ghost fishing (Sullivan et al., 2019 ). Similarly, a study removing 
abandoned crab traps in coastal Louisiana determined that 65% of 
derelict traps were actively ghost fishing a variety of crab and fish 
species (Anderson and Alford, 2014 ). Interestingly, not all abandoned 
fishing gear continually ghost fishes. Two studies from California 
observed little to no ghost fishing by fishing debris, although limitations 
in the methodology of this research are acknowledged (Love et al., 2010 ; 
Watters et al., 2010 ). 
Entanglement by marine debris generally poses a higher risk to larger 
animals, such as marine mammals, turtles and sharks, than for smaller 
animals. Two studies from the RFMD search examined the impacts of 
entanglement of organisms in plastic debris. One study reported the 
entanglement of 47 individuals from two otariid seal species, with in-
juries ranging from tight (soft constriction) to very severe (deep cut 
reaching muscular layers) (Franco-Trecu et al., 2017 ). While entangle -
ment in fur seals was predominantly caused by commercial fishing 
material, greater than 60% of material entangling sea lions was from 
local artisanal and recreational fishing (Franco-Trecu et al., 2017 ). 
Although the material that caused entanglement was not specified, it 
was likely due to various forms of line and netting. The second study 
reported entanglement of kelp gulls (Larus dominicanus ) by recreational 
monofilament lines (Yorio et al., 2014 ). A total of 27 gulls were found 
entangled, with 22 already deceased at the time of discovery. Those that 
were alive had severely damaged feathers which would compromise 
flight, notably decreasing the ability for post release survival (Yorio 
et al., 2014 ). 
Within marine food webs, plastic debris can also serve as a transport 
medium and a potential source of toxic chemicals and diseases. Toxic 
chemicals in plastics can include polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), 
endocrine-active substances, and chemicals similar to dichlor -
odiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). Recent evidence demonstrated that 
chemicals associated with plastic anthropogenic debris were bioavail -
able to lugworms and fish upon ingestion (Browne et al., 2013 ; Rochman 
et al., 2013 ). These chemicals are known to compromise immunity and 
cause infertility in animals, even at very low levels (Commonwealth of 
Australia, 2008 ). Plastics can also host pathogens such as those which 
trigger disease outbreaks on coral reefs (Lamb et al., 2018 ). 
Ingestion of plastic debris relating to fishing activity in larger marine 
organisms, such as cetaceans and sea turtles, has been recorded for de-
cades (Laist, 1997 ; Gorzelany, 1998 ). For cetaceans, numerous studies 
detail animals that have died as a result of ingested plastic debris 
(Gorzelany, 1998 ; Levy et al., 2009 ; Jacobsen et al., 2010 ). In the late 
nineties, for example, deaths of two bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops trun-
catus) resulting from the ingestion of monofilament line from recrea -
tional fishing were documented in Florida, USA (Gorzelany, 1998 ). 
Similarly, ingestion of fishing line was identified in 68% of loggerhead 
turtles (Caretta caretta ) assessed, even in the absence of clinical A.R. Watson et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Marine Pollution Bulletin 178 (2022) 113500
9symptoms (Franchini et al., 2018 ). Another study on loggerheads 
determined that although two deceased turtles had hooks, and hook 
related injuries in the intestinal tract, it was the attached monofilament 
line that had caused the lethal internal strangulation (Valente et al., 
2007 ). Cetacean and turtle digestion is typically determined post mor-
tem, hence data are skewed towards mortality as an endpoint. Little is 
known of the sublethal effects of plastic ingestion in these animals. 
Impacts of ingested plastic debris may pose serious risk to populations of 
such long lived marine organisms. 
Microplastics are a specifically identified subset of marine pollution 
that has received considerable attention. Microplastics can result from 
the breakdown of larger plastics but are also manufactured as small 
beads specifically for use in consumer goods. Through ingestion, they 
are accessible to a wide array of marine organisms from the smallest (e. 
g., plankton) to the largest marine fauna (e.g., whales) and this can cause 
a range of problems including intestinal blockage and other physical and 
physiological damage, all of which compromise the health of the or-
ganism (Jovanovi ˘c, 2017 ). Microplastic ingestion can also lead to 
behavioural changes, with consequences for reproduction, predator 
avoidance and foraging success (de S˘a et al., 2015 ; Tosetto et al., 2016 ; 
Egbeocha et al., 2018 ). Furthermore, as people consume filter-feeding 
organisms such as shrimp, scallops, mussels and sea cucumbers, the 
relationship to human health and food security becomes an increasing 
concern (Ivar do Sul and Costa, 2014 ). Fish and shellfish from seafood 
markets in Indonesia and USA show that approximately one in four in-
dividuals sampled from different trophic levels and habitats (coastal 
seagrass and reefs, pelagic) contained small fragments of fibres, foam, 
film, or monofilament in their digestive system (Rochman et al., 2015 ). 
Plastics also present a range of chemical threats as they can release 
their own toxic chemicals and also adsorb harmful contaminants present 
in the water (Teuten et al., 2009 ; Engler, 2012 ). Inorganic and organic 
contaminants such as PCBs, fertilisers and heavy metals are reported as 
being associated with microplastics (Teuten et al., 2009 ). Laboratory 
based studies have shown that plastics can act as a vector for chemical 
exposure in fish, and lead to bioaccumulation and adverse health effects 
such as behavioural change and endocrine disruption (Rochman et al., 
2013 ; Wardrop et al., 2016 ). However, another study using environ -
mentally relevant concentrations of plastics found no behavioural 
change in fish following short term exposure to plastic- contaminated 
prey, suggesting that such adverse impacts from plastic associated 
chemicals may result from chronic exposure (Tosetto et al., 2017 ). 
3.5.2. Metals 
Common components of recreational fishing gear are comprised of 
metal, including hooks, sinkers, swivels and traces. Metal components 
can impair the health of target and non-target species. A Korean study 
monitoring injuries to marine animals found that ingestion of hooks was 
by far the most prevalent impact, however, fishing line entanglement 
and ingestion of lead sinkers were also reported (Hong et al., 2013 ). 
Blood samples from three whooper swans (Cygnus cygnus ) revealed lead 
poisoning, indicating that the sinkers were likely a direct cause of death 
(Hong et al., 2013 ). Overall, recreational fishing debris contributed 
substantially more to injuries or mortality on wildlife (n 33) than 
commercial debris (n 9) (Hong et al., 2013 ). 
A fish breaking off and retaining terminal tackle is one route that 
fishing gear becomes marine debris. The retention of hooks and other 
terminal tackle by target, and non-target species, can result in serious 
injury or death. Photo identification of hooking incidents (external) with 
the critically endangered greynurse shark (Carcharias taurus ) across 
aggregation sites on Australia's East Coast found a high frequency of 
hooked individuals (113 individuals from 673 identified) (Bansemer and 
Bennett, 2010 ). The majority of these sites have highly limited or no 
recreational fishing allowed, with only a few having no limit on 
extractive uses such as fishing (Bansemer and Bennett, 2010 ), and is, 
therefore, likely that some of these hooks originated from recreational 
activity. While not all hooking events resulted in obvious injury at the time of the incident, severe jaw injuries can develop and worsen over 
time at the site of hooking (Bansemer and Bennett, 2010 ). Such hooking 
can also cause severe internal injuries. A recent case study on a carcass of 
this species documented ingestion of a J-hook that had perforated the 
intestinal wall, leading to cachexia, chronic bacterial infection and 
enterolithiasis (Otway et al., 2021 ). Ultimately it was the retention of 
this hook that led to the shark's death (Otway et al., 2021 ). The inter-
action between retained fishing gear and the greynurse shark is 
considered to be a key hindrance to the recovery of these populations 
(Bansemer and Bennett, 2010 ). Similar cases of internal injury and 
inflammation from retained hooks including peritonitis, pericarditis, 
hepatitis and cachexia have also been observed in blue sharks (Prionace 
glauca ) (Borucinska et al., 2001 ; Borucinska et al., 2002 ). Alternatively, 
the hook and other tackle may be expelled from the animal after some 
time, by detaching from the animal or if the animal passes it through the 
digestive tract. Then, as marine debris, this terminal tackle may interact 
with other fauna. 
The interaction between fishing gear and hooking of non-target 
species is known to be a substantial impact on marine organisms 
across fishing activities (Chiappone et al., 2005 ; Bugoni et al., 2008 ; 
Anderson et al., 2011 ; Afonso et al., 2012 ). These impacts are also 
observed from recreational or small scale artisanal fishing (Bugoni et al., 
2008 ; Bansemer and Bennett, 2010 ). 
Metal sinkers from recreational fishing activity have been reported as 
the predominant component of marine debris in some areas (Lloret 
et al., 2014 ; Farias et al., 2018 ). Many sinkers are comprised of lead, a 
highly toxic heavy metal with the potential to leach into the environ -
ment and become biologically available to organisms that ingest it 
(Vinodhini and Narayanan, 2008 ). Such leaching can indirectly impact 
on the health of marine flora and fauna. 
3.5.3. Other impacts 
In some instances, RFMD could lead to marine habitat alteration, 
degradation, or destruction through physical interference such as 
obstruction of sunlight, smothering, surface scoring, and abrasion 
(Fig. 8). Although habitat alteration and degradation are typically 
associated with commercial fishing activities such as trawling, such 
impacts from recreational fishing are also evident but generally at much 
smaller spatial scales. In Hawaii, a correlation was established between 
the impact of monofilament fishing line and dead or damaged cauli-
flower coral (Asoh et al., 2004 ). Impacts of RFMD can cascade through 
trophic levels, with changes to infaunal assemblages altering the natural 
foraging and home range behaviours of other marine animals (U.S. 
Commission on Ocean Policy, 2004 ; Gregory, 2009 ). 
In addition to impacts on biodiversity, marine debris in general has 
implications for humans in terms of aesthetics and economics, which are 
tightly intertwined (Hardesty et al., 2017 ). Presence of marine debris 
leads to degradation of the aesthetic quality of beaches and shallow 
areas. Marine debris can deter visitors, as cleanliness is the most 
important characteristic for most beachgoers (Ballance et al., 2000 ). For 
example, after a heavy rainfall event that resulted in a significant in-
crease in coastal debris loads in South Korea, revenue losses from 
tourism were estimated at $29–37 M USD (Jang et al., 2014 ). In coastal 
California, visitors travel longer distances to avoid beaches with more 
waste (Leggett et al., 2014 ), and a recent survey reported that 85% of 
Brazilian beachgoers will avoid beaches with high litter loads (F15 
pieces per m2) (Krelling et al., 2017 ; Santos et al., 2005 ). A drop in beach 
users and tourism can result in less business and revenue for a coastal 
community. Furthermore, news of possible marine debris or pollution 
can lead to economic loss for the seafood industry (Ofiara and Brown, 
1999 ). While the relative impact of RFMD on aesthetics and economics 
in comparison to other debris sources is unknown, it is almost certainly a 
contributing source given the size and geographical extent of the sector 
globally. A.R. Watson et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Marine Pollution Bulletin 178 (2022) 113500
103.6. Strategies for addressing RFMD 
Marine debris generally is a significant environmental problem, but 
there are feasible strategies and actions to address it. Strategies for 
addressing the risks associated with marine debris have been prepared at 
various levels (i.e. at global, regional, national, state and local scales) 
and all consider two key processes: (1) prevention, that is, the restriction 
and blocking of debris entering the environment; or (2) clean-ups that 
attempt its removal. In terms of prevention, strategies tend to distin -
guish marine debris sourced from land from that which is sourced from 
the sea and, within the latter, there is consideration of debris sourced 
from fishing as opposed to commercial shipping. However, there is 
generally no breakdown in these strategies for addressing the risk of 
‘fishing’ debris by sector. Given the origins of marine debris are not well 
known, including the component that may come from recreational 
fishing, most strategies advocate the collection of sufficient knowledge 
to first determine where management efforts should be targeted. The 
next step is generally to implement a process to understand how effec-
tive intervention measures are over time. 
3.6.1. Global, regional and national strategies 
In terms of strategies that have been proposed to address marine 
debris at the broadest level, the complexity of the issue prevents simple 
solutions. Because the issue involves many societal and economic di-
mensions, abating harmful marine debris requires multi-faceted ap-
proaches involving collaboration of researchers, industry, coastal 
managers, governments and polluters. Marine debris is also costly to 
remove, with some countries spending in the order of millions of dollars 
per year (UNEP, 2016). 
While ‘global’ strategies for dealing with marine debris, such as the 
recently developed Honolulu Strategy (UNEP, 2016), recognise the need 
for education and better waste management and clean-up practices on 
land and at sea, they stop short of prescribing specific marine debris 
reduction targets or actions. The Honolulu Strategy suggests that nations 
will need to develop strategy and policy at a local level as any strategy 
will depend on the social, cultural, environmental and economic con-
texts in which they are planned and implemented. 
Countries are addressing marine debris in various ways at a national 
level (Vince and Hardesty, 2018; Jambeck et al., 2015; Lasut et al., 
2018), but very few recognise a need to address recreational fishing 
activity directly in policy. In Australia, even though marine debris is 
recognised as a key threatening process to marine life at a national level, 
including recognition that a component of it comes from recreational 
and commercial fishing gear abandoned or lost to the sea, the threat 
abatement strategy to reduce its impacts applies only to Commonwealth 
areas, which do not include coastal areas under the jurisdiction of 
Australian States where most recreational fishing activity occurs 
(Australian Department of Environment and Energy, 2018). 
3.6.2. Localised and community-based strategies 
It is only at the more localised scales where some strategies for 
addressing marine debris have included specific focus on recreational 
fishing activity. In addition to the federal level (above), the Australian 
State of NSW recognises the entanglement in or ingestion of anthropo -
genically derived marine debris as a key threat to vertebrate life (i.e. 
additionally to federal recognition) and considers debris from recrea -
tional fishing activity contributing to the risk, particularly in relation to 
threatened species (NSW Fisheries Scientific Committee, 2004). In 
addition, the Management Strategy for the NSW Marine Estate includes 
initiatives to work with individual fishing sectors (including the recre -
ational sector) to further evaluate ecological risk of priority threats to 
the environment, which include boat- and shore-based recreational line 
and trap fishing. The Marine Strategy also partners with fishing sectors 
of the government to deliver information and training to fishers to 
improve self-compliance and sustainable fishing practices (NSW Marine 
Estate Management Authority, 2018). While the details for such partnerships are not yet fully developed, the intent is for sectors to build 
capability to self-regulate using tools such as environmental social re-
sponsibility policies, codes, or education in a way that justifies their 
social license to operate (SLO), rather than govern through regulatory 
measures. 
It makes administrative and economic sense to include communities 
or sectors such as the recreational fishing sector in decision making in 
resource management (Feeny et al., 1990). Feeny et al. (1990) recog -
nised that shared governance between the community and the state, 
along with self-management by sectors (or co-management) “can capi-
talize on the local knowledge and long-term self-interest of users, while 
providing for coordination with relevant uses and users over a wide 
geographic scope at potentially lower transaction (rule-enforcement) 
cost”. Co-management, where communities or sectors drive the solution 
and share responsibilities with regulatory bodies, is a practical option 
for recreational fisheries to identify potential marine debris issues 
associated with their activities and then manage that risk. There are 
numerous examples around the world where local communities 
including fishing sectors have used SLO to reduce the threat of marine 
debris (see review by Vince and Hardesty, 2018). Where potential 
threats from RFMD are identified, we consider the sector would be well- 
positioned to drive effective solutions through behavioural and gear- 
based strategies. 
The behaviour of recreational fishers in regard to littering, such as 
attitude to and frequency, is not known. Schultz et al. (2013) suggested 
that 15% of general littering (i.e. inappropriate disposal of waste) by the 
broader public, however, were a result of contextual variables, with 85% 
a result of personal qualities and that 81% of littering occurs with intent. 
Public opinion and goodwill are recognised as key components to 
driving change, and public education is considered the most effective 
form of litter prevention (The Florida Center for Solid and Hazardous 
Waste Management, 1998). In some Australian states, for example, 
OceanWatch Australia's (OWA) ‘Tangler bins’ are used as a practical 
environmental solution for promoting correct disposal and recovery of 
lost recreational fishing line that may litter recreational fishing hotspots. 
With educational material on stickers, the bins are not only a means to 
collect fishing tackle but also act as a behavioural change reminder to 
fishers to keep the fishing spot tidy for a better experience (http://www. 
oceanwatch.org.au/Backup/our-work/tangler-bin/). 
Where RFMD is considered a potential threat in a particular area, the 
recreational fishing community could drive marine debris clean-ups. In 
addition to reducing the volume of marine debris at the local level, these 
could highlight the sources of debris, including the extent to which 
RFMD contributed to the total, thus increasing awareness of the issue. A 
longstanding example is the “Clean Up the Pin” initiative that is focussed 
on cleaning up the Jumpinpin area, which lies between North and South 
Stradbroke Islands in southern Queensland, Australia – a popular rec-
reational fishing location (https://goldcoastcatchments.org/event/help 
-clean-up-the-pin/). 
3.6.3. Gear-based strategies 
Given the range of fishing gear available to recreational fishers, it is 
likely that some gears have a greater risk of breaking or being lost than 
others. The recreational fishing sector could investigate and support the 
use of fishing gears, codes, or strategies that would minimise the risk of 
gear becoming marine debris. 
One obvious option is to prohibit or avoid using certain types of gear 
that are problematic, especially where other equally efficient alterna -
tives with fewer environmental impacts exist. For example, Broadhurst 
et al. (2016) showed that Australian portunid crabs can be caught as 
effectively with lift nets as hoop nets (known colloquially as “witches 
hats”). Given that the latter can result in marine debris from broken 
twine (Broadhurst and Millar, 2017), it would make sense to support the 
use of lift nets over hoop nets. 
Another option is to proactively seek alternatives and give recrea -
tional fishers a greater choice of acceptable solutions. For example, A.R. Watson et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Marine Pollution Bulletin 178 (2022) 113500
11Broadhurst and Millar (2017) showed that if an alternative twine was 
used in the construction of Australian recreational portunid crab hoop 
nets, the marine debris resulting from interactions with crabs and the 
netting during fishing could be drastically reduced while still main -
taining catch rates. Broadhurst and Millar (2017) also explored fishing 
strategies that could further minimise twine loss and still maintain catch 
rates, such as length of set durations and fishing in accordance with 
activity cycles of crabs (diurnal, nocturnal and seasonal). 
Some of the solutions proposed by Broadhurst and Millar (2017) for 
portunid crab hoop nets are based on the use of stronger twine to avoid 
breakage of gear. While strength-based solutions to reducing debris 
make sense for traps and nets, they do not necessarily apply to rod and 
reel. Although heavier gauge line and terminal tackle would break less 
often than lighter gauge gear when fighting a fish, it would still require 
cutting off when snagged and would provide a greater risk to biota due 
to its durability when it became marine debris. Given many types of 
targeted fish are more difficult to hook with heavier gear, heavier gauge 
gear is not a practical solution to reducing marine debris from line 
fishing. Notwithstanding this, recreational fishers are presented with a 
range of choices for the components of terminal tackle (i.e. trace, 
sinkers, swivels, hooks and lures) that could be recommended through a 
code of practice based on each item's potential impact if it were to 
become marine debris. Stainless steel hooks and trace, for example, 
probably present a greater risk to biota, compared with gear made from 
other material, when they become RFMD because they corrode slowly. 
Gear-based strategies need not only be confined to fishing apparatus. 
Alternatives to plastic bags exist for bait bags. In Australia, the Tweed 
Bait company experimented with biodegradable bags but as yet have 
been unable to find a product that would degrade in the environment 
but not degrade in their freezers. Bags made from polyvinyl alcohol 
(PVA), a synthetic water-soluble biopolymer blended with starch, show 
promise for the future (http://tweedbait.com.au/our-enviroment-2/). 
3.6.4. Monitoring 
Monitoring is a necessary part of evaluating strategy effectiveness. 
Research, assessment and monitoring provide essential information to 
support the spectrum of marine debris threat-reduction efforts. These 
include how to design effective actions under a strategy, focus attention 
on specific impacts and targets of concern, define the geographic scale 
and location to implement activities useful for determining appropriate 
partners, and monitor intermediate and threat-reduction results. 
4.Key issues and conclusions 
To fully assess the extent to which RFMD may be a problem we need 
to understand its sources and sinks, and the scale of impacts for current 
and future loads of its various components. In terms of its sources, we 
considered that activities of recreational fishers provide a potential 
source of marine debris either from deliberate or accidental loss of 
material into the aquatic environment. Although recreational fishers in 
most countries are obliged to store all waste for correct disposal ashore, 
actual waste disposal practices by fishers are unknown and are likely to 
be variable. Nevertheless, the limited information available in the 
literature that correlated the amount of general marine debris with 
recreational fishing activity indicates that there is some deliberate or 
accidental loss of general waste. The nature of recreational fishing and 
the types of gear used indicate that there would be breakage and acci-
dental loss of equipment. This is particularly the case for terminal tackle 
on fishing lines. Although we found very little information that quan-
tified actual loss rates of equipment the loss rates of commercial gear 
were a guide as to what could be expected, and this remains a key 
knowledge gap for RFMD. 
In terms of the potential impacts of the components of RFMD it is 
clear that many fishing items, or their broken-down products, and 
general waste such as plastic bait bags, have potential to seriously 
threaten the survival of marine organisms by causing adverse consequences. These range from direct impacts like entanglement, 
ingestion of harmful materials (including breakdown products) to in-
direct impacts such as trophic cascades. This conclusion is based not 
only on studies of discarded fishing gear generally but specific reports on 
adverse impacts and mortality from the limited literature available on 
discarded recreational fishing gear (Hong et al., 2013; Yorio et al., 2014; 
Franco-Trecu et al., 2017; Sullivan et al., 2019). 
In terms of the sinks of RFMD, the available data indicate that 
shallow estuarine and coastal areas and rocky ledges or uneven ba-
thymetry are characterised as sinks for RFMD as recreational fishing 
activity is most common in nearshore coastal areas and rough bottoms 
where gear tends to snag. Plastic and metal debris from recreational 
fishing were the most commonly reported, which is consistent with 
general marine debris volumes reported (Supplementary material, 
Table 1) (Derraik, 2002). Given recreational fishing effort can be 
concentrated around fishing hotspots, these areas, in particular, would 
be most likely to have relatively greater concentrations of RFMD and 
there was some evidence of this in the literature. 
In terms of loads, there is a lack of available data on the contribution 
of recreational fishing activity to marine debris, and most of the limited 
data available was locally concentrated. The expanse and largely inac-
cessible nature of the marine environment makes it difficult to provide 
thorough estimates of the marine debris load generally, let alone the 
proportion contributed by recreational fishing, and this remains another 
key knowledge gap for RFMD. 
Notwithstanding the limited information about sources, sinks and 
loads of RFMD, we consider that past attitudes towards recreational 
contribution to, and indirect estimates of, RFMD loads have likely 
underestimated its impact. We suggest that it may be a problem, at least 
at hotspots, based on the sheer number of recreational fishers, potential 
for activity to be concentrated, potential loss rates of some types of 
fishing gear (particularly terminal tackle on fishing lines) and correla -
tions of loads of marine debris that include fishing material at popular 
fishing locations (Fig. 6 and Supplementary material, Table 1). 
Other factors that have limited us forming definitive conclusions 
about the scale of impacts of RFMD are that much of the research on the 
volume of marine debris has been done at local scales with short-term 
monitoring. These studies thus have the potential to underestimate 
debris loads (Smith and Markic, 2013). Due to the varying properties of 
material, either weight or numerical counts of debris may under or over 
represent its quantity, and there is likely a visual bias towards larger and 
more colourful debris items during sampling. A broader issue is the lack 
of common metrics among studies (Serra-Gonçalves et al., 2019). Few 
studies reported categories of debris load as a percentage of total debris 
found, deeming a comprehension of the quantity of RFMD impossible. 
Furthermore, varying scales and methods of sampling marine debris 
may not only bias assessment of debris found but also make comparisons 
of debris load between studies difficult. Classification of debris into 
categories based on material, source, size and/or object is also prob-
lematic due to a lack of consistency in categories among studies. To 
allow better comprehension and comparison among studies of marine 
debris, we recommend that a standardised classification approach and 
reporting guideline is developed. Well-designed studies that quantify 
and characterise RFMD at both the sources and sinks will play a key role 
in confirming or dismissing its potential for impact and will provide the 
tools for managing potential impacts where they are identified for 
particular areas. 
It is not surprising that recreational fishing material is generally not 
referred to in prevention or clean-up strategies for marine debris 
because the contribution of this component to the total load is not yet 
well understood. Given we have identified a potential problem of RFMD 
at local scales, we recommend that specific strategies for managing 
RFMD are developed, but that these include a first stage to collect suf-
ficient knowledge to verify the level of the issue and then to determine 
whether intervention (prevention and/or clean-up) and monitoring is 
necessary. Where an issue is identified, cooperative approaches will A.R. Watson et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Marine Pollution Bulletin 178 (2022) 113500
12ultimately help resolve the issue and we recommend using tools such as 
environmental social responsibility policies, codes of practice or edu-
cation. Given the recreational sector has the local knowledge and ca-
pacity for self-management it makes sense for it to drive education- 
based solutions that focus on changes to behaviour and the use of 
particular types of gear.
