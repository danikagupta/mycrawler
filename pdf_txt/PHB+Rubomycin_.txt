SUMMARY
Polymers are of tremendous importance in the delivery of drugs to the 
site of action. Natural polymers are preferable to synthetic ones because 
they are biocompatible and biodegradable. Polyhydroxyalkanoates 
(PHAs) are polyesters of various hydroxyalkanoate monomers 
accumulated by a wide range of bacterial strains in the form 
of intracellular granules, under unbalanced growth and excess 
carbon conditions. Polyhydroxyalkanoates have been tipped as a 
potential replacement for synthetic polymers due to their superior 
biocompatibility, biodegradability and controllable retarding 
properties. However, the cost of production of PHA compared to the 
synthetic polymers they are envisioned to replace is high. Studies have 
been done to reduce cost by employing cheap and renewable carbon 
sources. This review article presents an overview of PHA production 
from these sources as well as the use of PHA in the delivery of drugs

Polymers are a major part of the drug delivery 
system. They are essential for the provision of weight 
consistency as well as volume necessary for appropri -
ate drug administration. Polymers are of importance 
in providing drug stability, release and targeting, im -
proved bioavailability as well as patient acceptability 
(Beneke et al.,  2009).
Synthetic plastics are useful in almost all facet of 
manufacturing, including pharmaceuticals. Their ex -
tensive usefulness can be attributed to the susceptibil -
ity of their structure to chemical manipulation. They are however mostly resistant to microbial degradation 
which makes their disposal problematic (Fletcher, 
1993).
Biodegradable polymers, mainly of natural ori -
gins, are being gradually tipped to replace the non-de -
gradable plastics. Biopolymers, being biocompatible, 
are being processed for various applications such as in 
the packaging industry, agriculture, chemical indus -
try and medicine. Due to these, it is important to en -
sure large-scale production and extensive use of these 
biodegradable polymers. This will provide alternative 
sources of plastics and also benefit the environment 
(Zinn et al., 2001).

Microbial polymers are now being considered be -
cause of their biocompatibility and non-toxic proper -
ties. PHAs are polyesters of various hydroxyalkanoate 
monomers accumulated by a wide range of Gram 
positive and Gram-negative bacteria as intracellular 
granules, under unbalanced growth and excess carbon 
conditions (Verlinda et al., 2007). Poly(3-hydroxybu -
tyrate) (PHB) is the first polymer in the PHA fami -
ly. It is sometimes abbreviated as P(3HB) and has a 
hanging methyl group. PHB is produced by bacteria 
and algae, with a high degree of crystallinity (Moore 
and Saunders, 2013). It is brittle and rigid making it 
unsuitable for many applications. While PHB is bio -
degradable, its mechanical and physical properties are 
comparable to that of polypropene. 
The advantages offered by poly(3-hydroxybutyr -
ate) (PHB) and co-polymers, notably poly(3-hydroxy -
butyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV), compared to other synthesized polymers including polylactate, 
polyglycolate, and poly(lactide-co-glycolide) have 
shifted attention to their use in drug delivery as carri -
ers or in tissue engineering as scaffolds. These advan -
tages include biodegradability, excellent biocompati -
bility and easier processability. The retarding proper -
ties can also be controlled by varying the production 
process of the polymer and also the molecular weight 
of the constituent. An enhanced scope in the biomed -
ical application is envisaged with a combination of 
PHB and other biocompatible and nontoxic polymers 
(Errico et al.,  2009). 
High cost has been an impediment to the produc -
tion of PHA on a large scale. There is, therefore, the 
need for identifying and utilizing cheap and sustain -
able carbon source for industrial production (Sandhya 
et al.,  2013; Urtuvia et al., 2014). 149
FABAD J. Pharm. Sci., 44, 2, 147-158, 2019Production of PHA from cheap and renewable 
substrates
Poly-3-(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) 
was produced from olive mill wastewater (OMW) by 
extremely halophile Haloferax  mediterranei  in a one-
stage cultivation step (Alsafadi and Al-Mashaqbeh, 
2017). Media containing different concentrations of 
OMW were prepared and the optimum cultivation 
conditions were achieved in a medium that contained 
15% OMW . A polymer yield of 0.2g/L and a PHA 
content of 43% PHA/cell dry mass were the high -
est obtained. These were obtained at 370C, 22% salt 
concentration and 170rpm. Analysis showed the bio -
synthesized PHA to be copolymer poly(3-hydroxybu -
tyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) of 6.5mol% 3-hydroxy -
valerate. This copolymer was produced devoid of a 
fermentation step or the addition of an external sub -
strate. The copolymer, compared to PHB, also showed 
lowered melting points at 140.10C and 154.40C.
Olive mill wastewater was also utilized to ascer -
tain the possibility of PHA production from a pure 
culture of Cypriavidus  necator  (Martinez et al.,  2015). 
An effluent rich in volatile fatty acid was produced 
by initially dephenolizing and fermenting the OMW . 
Different dilutions of the effluent (25%, 50%, 75% and 
100%) were prepared and pre-grown cells of C. neca -
tor fed with the dilutions. Inhibition was observed 
with 75% and 100%. Further analysis indicated that 
the inhibition observed was majorly responsible for 
by the polyphenols. Two consecutive accumulation 
batch processes were carried out using 25% effluent, 
with no external carbon source. Through the process, 
up to 55% of cell dry weight of poly(3-hydroxybutyr -
ate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) containing 11% 
hydroxyvalerate was accumulated.
Aremu et al.  (2010) showed that cheap renewable 
hydrolysate of cassava starch reducing sugar can be 
utilized as a carbon source by Pseudomonas  aerugi -
nosa  for polyhydroxy butyrate (PHB) production in 
batch fermentation processes. Extraction of starch 
was carried out from fresh cassava tubers and this was 
subjected to hydrolysis by the enzyme-enzyme meth -
od. The mixture of the hydrolysate and nutrient media 
in batch cultures was used as a medium for aerobic 
fermentation of P. aeruginosa . Gas chromatography 
method was then used to measure the PHB content. 
The result showed that PHB more than 50% of the cell 
dry weight was accumulated by the organism.
H. mediterranei  has shown the ability to accumu -
late PHA on a high salt concentration medium. The 
product of an enzymatic reactive extrusion treatment 
of native corn starch was used as carbon source for growth of cell and PHA production (Chen et al.,  
2006).
Waste glycerol, a biodiesel industry byproduct, 
has been used as the carbon source for cell growth 
and PHB production in C. necator  DSM 545 (Caval -
heiro et al.,  2009).
High yield of PHB was produced by Ralstonia  eu-
tropha  NCIMB 11599 when saccharified waste potato 
starch was utilized as carbon source with phosphate 
limitation. Biomass 179g/l, 94g/l PHB and PHB pro -
ductivity of 1.47g/l/h were achieved. While there was 
an accumulation of residual maltose in the fed-batch 
reactor, insignificant inhibition was however ob -
served (Haas et al., 2008).
Beet molasses was used as a substrate for the 
synthesis of PHB (Yilmaz and Beyatli, 2005). It was 
found out that B. cereus  M5 strain produced the high -
est dry cell mass (0.44g/l) in 4% molasses concentra -
tion. Higher PHB (73.84% PHB on dry cell mass) was 
produced by the strain in 1% molasses concentration, 
indicating that molasses concentration is inversely 
proportional to the strain’s PHB productivity.
Ataei et al. (2008) produced PHA using 5% date 
syrup added with mineral salt medium as substrate. 
The PHA-producing bacteria were isolated from a 
date factory syrup waste. The colonies containing 
intracellular granules (identified with Sudan Black 
stain), grown in the syrup was incubated at 300C and 
shaken at 140 rpm for 60 hours. One of the strains 
yielded a PHB representing 71% cell dry weight. An -
other strain produced PHBV in date syrup media at a 
peak concentration of 2.2g/L and 10% valerate con -
tent in shake flask cultivation.
Crude glycerol was also used as a substrate for PHA 
synthesis by a mixed microbial community (Moita et 
al., 2014). A PHB yield of 47% cell dry weight pro -
duced at 0.27g/L by a mixed culture of aerobic strains 
was obtained. The final cost of the polymer is reduced 
by this process because the crude glycerol used in 
PHA production required no pretreatment step.
Poly-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-valerate (PHBV) was 
successfully synthesized by R. eutropha  via oxygen 
limitation, using trade and industry and fruit and veg -
etable wastes, as the only source of carbon (Ganzeveld 
et al., 1999). The PHBV yielded from the concentra -
tion of the fatty acids in the organic waste was found 
to be 0.16g polymer/volatile organic matter.
Poly (β-hydroxybutyrate) has also been shown 
to be produced by P . fluorescence , strain A2a5. High 
PHB granules were accumulated in the sugarcane li -150
Balogun-Agbaje, Odeniyi, Odeniyiquor medium cultured cells (Jiang et al.,  2008). Sam -
ple from the cell, after purification, was identified to 
be PHB by gas chromatography and nuclear magnetic 
resonance analysis of polyester. PHB concentration of 
31g/L was reached in shaking bottles. In 5L bioreac -
tor, the yield of PHB obtained was 22g/L, which was 
up to 70% of the cell dry weight. 
PHA can be produced by activated sludge with an -
aerobic feeding and discharge (AFD) process, using 
alkaline fermentation liquid of waste activated sludge 
(W AS) as a carbon source (Jiang et al., 2009). The re -
port showed that this AFD process had the highest 
PHA yield compared to other reported processes of 
PHA synthesis. Subjecting activated sludge to the 
AFD process resulted in a PHA yield of 72.9% in the 
sludge. Nitrogen and phosphorus were released into 
the fermentation liquid. These released gases, how -
ever, showed no effect on PHA synthesis, making 
it possible for the fermentation liquid to be directly 
used for the production of PHA. 3-hydroxybutyrate 
(3HB) (73.5mmolC%), 3-hydroxyvalerate (3HV) 
(24.3mmolC%) and 3-hydroxy-2-methylvalerate 
(3H2MV) (2.2mmolC%) were the main constituents 
of the accumulated PHA. γ- proteobacteria , α-proteo -
bacteria , and β- proteobacteria  were shown to be the 
major microorganism in the PHA synthesis system 
(data analysed using 165 rRNA gene clone library).
The biosynthesis of PHA by Alcaligenes  spp. and 
Pseudomonas  oleovorans  using different substrates 
has been studied (Santhanam and Sasidharan, 2010). 
Fructose, lactose, glucose, commercial sugar and 
n-octane were studied as different carbon sources. 
Medium with glucose carbon source gave rise to the 
maximum PHA content of 4.14g/L for Alcaligenes  
eutrophus  while n-octane as carbon source produced 
2.06g/L for P. oleovorans . Using FTIR spectroscopy 
analysis, C=O group was identified as the functional 
groups of the retrieved PHA granules.
An attempt was made to enhance the production 
of PHB by supplementing the carbon sources via a 
two-stage process and continuous feeding of ammo -
nium chloride (Y eo et al.,  2008). Gluconate and glu -
cose were respectively used as carbon source in the 
first and second stages. The specific growth rate was 
maximized with the aid of gluconate while glucose 
was used to maximize PHB biosynthesis. In contrast 
to cultures in which glucose was used as the sole sub -
strate, a 50% enhancement of PHB productivity was 
achieved when gluconate and glucose were consecu -
tively fed. Also feeding the culture with a trace amount 
of NH4Cl (0.03mmol/h) before the initial amount of 
NH4Cl is used up enhanced PHB production com -pared to cultures containing glucose alone. A higher 
level of NADPH was observed in glucose-grown cul -
ture, during the NH4Cl-exhausted PHB accumulation 
stage, compared to the gluconate-grown culture.
PHB has similarly been synthesized by a batch 
culture of Alcaligenes  latus , American Type Culture 
Collection 29713, using sucrose as substrate (Grothe 
et al.,  1999). Under optimum condition, the PHB 
yield was up to 63% of dry cell mass when cultured for 
93 hours, with a mean biomass yield coefficient on su -
crose of around 0.4kg/kg. Using ammonium sulphate 
or ammonium chloride as the source of nitrogen at 
pH 6.5 and temperature between 250C and 370C were 
found to give the optimum condition for PHB yield.
Lactose, a disaccharide of galactose and glucose, 
linked by a glycosidic bond has been useful as a car -
bon source for PHA synthesis. Whey is a cheap and 
sustainable source of lactose and it, as well as whey 
permeate, has been used as a carbon source by the fol -
lowing bacteria strains; Hydrigenophaga  pseudoflava  
DSM 1034 and Sinorhizobium melitoti  41 (Povolo et 
al., 2003; Povolo et al.,  2013), Methylobacterium  sp. 
ZP24 (Y ellore and Desai, 1998), Bacillus  megaterium  
(Pandians et al.,  2010), recombinant Escherichia  coli 
(Ahn et al.,  2000; Ahn et al.,  2001), Thermus  thermo -
philus  HB8 (Pantazaki et al.,  2009).
The major constituent of corn, sorghum, cassava, 
rice and potato is starch. It is made up of D-glucose 
units with α-1,4-glycosidic bonds. Glucose is the most 
extensively utilized carbon source for the industrial 
scale production of PHA. It is yielded upon enzymatic 
or acid hydrolysis of starch. Imperial Chemical Indus -
tries (ICI) produced commercial PHA using glucose 
derived from starch with R. eutropha  (Bryom, 1992).
Fermentation of glucose was compared with 
xylose and arabinose fermentation using Pseudo -
monas  pseudoflava  (Bertrand et al.,  1990). The con -
version using glucose as a substitute is found high -
er (0.40gPHA/g) than using xylose and arabinose 
(0.17-0.19gPHA/g). The production of PHA when xy -
lose and arabinose were utilized by the cells was also 
slower (four- to five-times) than when glucose was 
used. As a co-substrate with glucose, liquefied wood 
has also been used to incorporate 3-hydroxyvalerate 
units into the produced PHA (Koller et al.,  2015). 
In a recent study, PHA producing bacteria were 
isolated from diverse soil, dump sites and water sam -
ples. Media optimization was however required to 
improve the amount of PHA produced. Glucose and 
ammonium sulphate were found to be the best car -
bon and nitrogen source for PHA production. The 151
FABAD J. Pharm. Sci., 44, 2, 147-158, 2019isolate exhibited innate capability to hydrolyze agri -
cultural residue supplied as carbon source and used 
them for PHA production. Further, the optimum pH, 
temperature and time of recovery of PHA in Bacillus 
thuringiensis  SBC4 was 7.0, 37◦C and 48 h. The mod -
ified medium compounded from optimised parame -
ters increased PHA yield, while FTIR analysis showed 
characteristic PHA peaks (Odeniyi and Adeola, 2017).
Commercial production of PHA
Only four PHA have been produced on a com -mercial scale and these are: poly[( R)-3-hydroxybutyr -
ate] (PHB), poly[( R)-3-hydroxybutyrate- co-(R)-3-hy -
droxyvalerate] (PHBV), poly[( R)-3-hydroxybu -
tyrate- co-4-hydroxybutyrate] (P3HB4HB), and 
poly[( R)-3-hydroxybutyrate- co-(R)-3-hydroxyhexa -
noate] (PHBHHx). However, small-scale production 
of medium-chain-length (mcl) PHA has been done. 
The production of PHA generally involve several 
steps, these include: fermentation, separation of bio -
mass from the broth, biomass drying, PHA extraction, 
drying, and packaging (Figure 2).
Figure 2. Polyhydroxyalkanoate production and extraction process
Nonato et al. (2001) suggested that PHB and relat -
ed copolymers can be advantageously produced when 
the production is integrated into a sugarcane mill. In 
this set-up, the energy necessary for the production 
process is provided by biomass and the polymer pro -
duced at low cost in light of the available low-price 
carbon source and energy (Nonato et al. 2001). 
The cost of production of PHA can also be ame -
liorated by blending with low cost materials such as 
starch and cellulose, while retaining the desirable 
characteristics of the polymer (Chen and Wu, 2005).
PHA as a drug delivery polymer
The primary objective of drug delivery systems is 
to increase the bioavailability and controlled release 
of drugs with respect to time and space. PHA materi -
als have a huge potential in drug delivery applications 
(Francis et al., 2016). PHA microspheres or microcap -
sules have been used as drug carrier for the delivery of 
anaesthetics, hormones, steroids, antibiotics, anti-in -flammatory agents, anticancer agents and vaccines 
(Nobes et al.,  1998; Orts et al.,  2008).
Shah et al.  (2010)  prepared an amphiphilic 
nanoparticle by an emulsification-solvent evapo -
ration technique. The nanoparticles were prepared 
from diblock copolymer produced by chemically cou -
pling poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) 
or poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate) to 
monomethoxy poly(ethylene glycol) (mPEG), using 
transesterification reaction. The drug thymoquinone 
was incorporated into the nanoparticle and the drug 
release profile examined. Enzymatic degradation of 
the mPEG-coupled and non-coupled PHA nanopar -
ticles was compared. The comparison showed that the 
nanoparticles aligned into an outer hydrophilic shell 
of mPEG attached to the interior hydrophobic core 
of PHA. It was, therefore, opined that, due to the fact 
that the amphiphilic nanoparticles contained the hy -
drophobic PHA portion embedded in the core, they 
could be safely used as carriers for the controlled re -152
Balogun-Agbaje, Odeniyi, Odeniyilease of different hydrophobic drugs. 
Magnetic PHB nanoparticles to target cancer cells 
were prepared by Erdal et al.  (2012). PHB polymer 
synthesized from A. eutrophus  was used to coat iron 
oxide particles, using the multi-emulsion technique. 
Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry (FTIR), 
Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) and Vibrating Sample 
Magnetometer (VSM) and Scanning electron micro -
scope (SEM) and Atomic force microscope (AFM) 
were respectively used to structurally, magnetically 
and morphologically characterize the nanoparticles.  
Etoposide (used as a drug) and Concanavalin-A 
(Con-A) (used to target cancer cells) were loaded 
onto the nanoparticles and the release kinetics of the 
drug evaluated. 
Lee et al.  (2011) demonstrated a method for the 
functionalization of hydrophobic nanocarrier surface 
via enzymatic polymerization. Coupling of hydro -
phobic surface of PHB nanoparticles with PHB chain 
grown from PHA synthase to which a specific ligand 
is attached was used to functionalize the nanoparti -
cles. The ligand used, RDG4C, is specific to MDA-
MB231 cancer cells as shown by the affinity of the 
functionalized PHA nanoparticles. This affinity indi -
cates that targeting ability was conferred on the drug 
carrier due to the effective display of RDG4C on the 
PHB nanoparticles surface through enzymatic modi -
fication.
Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyocta -
noate) [P(HB-HO)] was used as a carrier in a system 
of targeted drug delivery (Zhang et al.,  2010). Fo -
lic acid (FA) and doxorubicin (DOX) were respec -
tively employed as targeting ligand and anticancer 
drug. The mean size, encapsulation efficiency and 
the drug loading capacity of the produced doxoru -
bicin-loaded, folate-mediated P(HB-HO) nanopar -
ticles (DOX/FA-PEG-P(HB-HO) nanoparticles) 
were respectively, 240nm, 83.5% and 29.6%. An in 
vitro  intracellular uptake test showed the HeLa cells 
to be more efficient in taking up the DOX/FA-PEG-
P(HB-HO) nanoparticles. Due to the uptake, the 
nanoparticles at IC50 of 0.87µm were more toxic to 
the HeLa cells compared to other treated cells. The 
nanoparticles also displayed a better efficacy against 
tumor growth in an in vivo observation. The final 
mean volume of the tumor (178.91 ± 17.43mm3) 
was found to be of smaller size, compared to the 
normal saline control group (542 ± 45.19mm3). The 
folate-mediated nanoparticles loaded with doxoru -
bicin were shown to be effectively used in the target -
ed delivery of anticancer to folate receptor overex -
pressed tumor cells.PHB and copolymer poly(3-hydroxybutyr -
ate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) (PHBHHx) nanopar -
ticles were shown to be utilized for controlled intra -
cellular drug release (Xiong et al.,  2009). Rhodamine 
B isothiocyanate (RBITC) was used to examine the 
drug release properties of the prepared nanoparticles 
of PHB, PHBHHx and polylactic acid (PLA). The 
drug loading efficiency shown by the nanoparticles 
was more than 75%. Macrophage endocytosis gave 
rise to a controlled intracellular drug release that last -
ed up to 20 days for nanoparticles of PHB and PHBH -
Hx. Nanoparticles of PLA and the free drug however 
released over 15 and 7 days, respectively. 
Gangrade and Price (1991) examined the use of 
PHB and PHBV microspheres as carriers for the con -
trolled delivery of progesterone. PHB-PHBV micro -
spheres were well incorporated with more than 80% 
of the theoretical progesterone content. PHBV mi -
crospheres with 9% hydroxyvalerate had the slowest 
in vitro  release due to their less porosity compared to 
microspheres of other polymers.
Rubomycin incorporated in absorbable polymer -
ic PHB matrix in the microparticulate form has been 
studied for antitumor efficiency. Mice transplanted 
with Ehrlich ascitic carcinoma was used in the exam -
ination of the anti-tumor effect of the dosage form. 
The drug was shown to be effective in arresting the 
carcinoma proliferation and thus increased mice sur -
vival (Shishatskaya et al.,  2008).
Lu et al. (2011) reported the use of PHA as an 
anticancer drug carrier. Phosphoinositide-3-kinase 
(P13K) inhibitor (TGX221) controlled release sys -
tem was prepared and used to inhibit cancer cell 
lines growth. The controlled release system was PHA 
nanoparticle-based. The PHA-based nanoparticles 
gradually released TGX221 and significantly slowed 
growth of cancer cell lines compared to cancer cells 
treated with free drug or negative control.
Self-assembled amphiphilic copolymer nanopar -
ticles loaded with cisplatin was examined for cispla -
tin efficacy and bioavailability (Shah et al.,  2012). 
Coupling of poly (3-hydroxyvalerate-co-4hydroxy -
butyrate) with monomethoxypoly (ethylene glycol) 
through transesterification, using bis(2-ethylhexa -
noate) tin as catalyst, was used to synthesize an am -
phiphilic block polymer P(3HV-CO-4HB)-b-mPEG. 
The polymer was loaded with cisplatin and an in vi -
tro drug release profile studied. The study showed a 
sustained drug release from the polymer hydrophobic 
core. Examination by transmission electron and con -
focal microscopy showed cisplatin-loaded nanoparti -
cles to be well incorporated in the cancer cells. The 153
FABAD J. Pharm. Sci., 44, 2, 147-158, 2019examination also showed that the growth of the cells 
was inhibited.
Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) 
[P(HB-co-HV)] rod impregnated with gentamycin 
or sulperazone was studied for in vitro antibiotic re -
lease. A sustained release of the antibiotics into aque -
ous solution for a period of two weeks was observed. 
Altering the hydroxyvalerate (HV) content of the 
copolymer changed the kinetics of drug release. A 
higher HV content (20%, compared with 7% or 14%) 
prolonged the controlled release of sulperazone to 60 
days (Gursel et al.,  2002).
The release of gentamycin incorporated into 
P(HB-co-HV) discs was measured over time. Copo -
lymers containing 12% HV and 8% HV at 2:1 or 5:1 
(w/w) ratio were compared and the copolymer with 
higher HV content found to release more gentamycin 
into solution (Rossi et al.,  2004).
Different PHA polymers and copolymer possess 
different drug release potentials. An example of this 
was demonstrated by Wang et al.  (2003). It was shown 
that tamsulosin incorporated with poly(hydroxyhexa -
noate-co-hydroxyoctanoate) (P(HHx-co-HO)) copo -
lymer facilitated the permeation of drug into the skin. 
PHB has higher crystallinity and poor skin adherence 
in the studied system and was, therefore, less suitable 
for the task.
Tetracycline was incorporated into P(3HB-co-
3HV), the 3HV content varied and the copolymer in -
vestigated for tetracycline controlled release (Sendil et 
al., 1999). Tetracycline was loaded in both the neutral 
and acidic forms into the PHBV microspheres and 
microcapsules. In vitro release profile of the systems 
was then carried out. The release was found to be total 
before degradation set in.
Tablet preparations intended for controlled release 
of 7-hydroxyethyltheophylline were embedded with -
in the P(3HB) matrix (William and Martin, 2005). 
The tablets were prepared by mixing and compress -
ing the polymer and the drug. However, the number 
of investigations reported in literature on PHA tablet 
formulations is significantly lower than that of bio -degradable implants and microencapsulation. This 
low interest in the usage of PHAs in tablet formula -
tion might be due to relative high cost of PHAs which 
dwarfs the possible benefits.
The release of fluorescein, and dextrans labelled 
with fluorescein, from tablets prepared with poly 
(3HB-co-3HV) prepared by direct compression 
method was investigated (Gould et al., 1987). The rate 
of drug release was found to significantly increase 
with increase in drug loading and with increase in 
valerate in the copolymer (Korsatko et al., 1983). The 
addition of microcrystalline cellulose or lactose also 
caused an increase in release rate (Gould et al., 1987).
Further, blends of rigid P(3HB) and flexible 
P(3HO) were investigated as a matrix for drug-eluting 
coronary stents. The local delivery of antithrombotic 
agents can significantly reduce the risk of reoccur -
rence of the arterial blockage after stent implantation 
(Basnett et al., 2013). Hence, aspirin was loaded into 
the matrix of the PHA blend via solvent casting, and 
the drug was uniformly distributed throughout the 
matrix. Only a weak burst release of the drug (less 
than 10% of total load) was observed in the first 24 
hours of in vitro release studies. Following the initial 
burst release, aspirin was released at a relatively con -
stant rate within 20 days and practically full release 
was achieved after 30 days. It is of interest to note that 
embedding the aspirin in the hydrophobic PHA ma -
trix, thereby increasing its stability, significantly in -
creased delivery of approximately 60% of aspirin in its 
therapeutically active form.
In an in vitro study of antibiotic release in an 
aqueous solution, P(HB- co-HV) rods impregnated 
with either gentamicin or Sulperazone sustained drug 
release for 2 weeks. Also, using a higher HV content 
copolymer (20% HV , compared to 7% or 14% HV), a 
sustained release of Sulperazone for over 60 days was 
achieved. Kinetics of release was altered by changing 
the amount of drug loading. Higher levels of cumu -
lative release were obtained using a copolymer with 
higher HV content (Gursel et al., 2002). Table 1 pres -
ents a survey of drug release from some PHA matrices 
(Bringham and Sinskey, 2012).154
Balogun-Agbaje, Odeniyi, OdeniyiGentamicin was incorporated into P(HB- co-HV) 
discs, and drug release was measured over time. Poly -
mer containing higher HV content displayed a high -
er degree of drug release into solution (12% 3HV v. 
8% HV). These P(HB- co-HV) discs containing gen -
tamicin incubated in normal human blood samples  
displayed no toxicity as there were no proliferation of 
white blood cells, red blood cells or platelets (Rossi et 
al., 2004)
Lower crystallinity PHA has been suggested for 
better timed release of drug into the surrounding tis -
sue as studies have shown that the release of antibi -
otics, such as rifampicin and tetracycline, from PHB 
microspheres results in  a too rapid release (Zinn et 
al., 2001). For example, on mixing tamulosin with 
poly(hydroxyhexanoate- co-hydroxyoctanoate (P(H -
Hxco-HO)) polymer, permeation of the drug through 
the polymer into skin was facilitated. However, PHB 
was less suited for this due to both its higher crystal -
linity and its inability to adhere to skin in the system 
tested (Wang et al., 2003). P(3HB- co-4HB) polymer 
has also been shown to be effective at releasing drug 
in solution (Tuercin et al., 2001).
Microspheres of P(3HB) have been prepared using 
the spray drying technique, a technique rarely used 
for the production of PHA particles (Kim et al., 2000). 
The method resulted in the formation of microspheres 
of smaller size range (0.6-1.1µm as opposed to 5-100 
µm prepared by the solvent evaporation method), 
uniform size distribution and high porosity, which 
results in higher drug loading. Thus in vitro studies 
with P(3HB) and P(3HB-3HHx) nanoparticles (150-
250 nm) showed an efficient internalization into mac -
rophage without affecting cell viability. Sustained re -
lease of the drug was achieved over a period of more 
than 20 days (Xiong et al., 2010). PHAs nanospheres 
were used for encapsulating TGX221, a PI3K inhibi -
tor, blocking proliferation of cancer cells by the same research group. Drug-loaded nanoparticles directly 
delivered into the cancerous cells improved drug de -
livery and led to inhibition of cancer cells (Lu et al., 
2011).
PHA nanoparticles have been loaded with a broad 
range of drugs to evaluate them for drug administra -
tion in various illnesses. Also, by attaching targeting 
moieties the particles have been modified to improve 
drug delivery. As mentioned earlier, one of the first 
studies involved the use of PHB and PHBV (9 and 
24% of HV units) for the preparation of microspheres 
loaded with progesterone (Gangade and Price, 1991). 
The encapsulation efficiency for these systems was 
relatively high with more than 80% of the theoretical 
amount of drug being successfully loaded in all cases. 
Another study involved the preparation of 
nanoparticles from PHB and PHBHx (containing 
12% of HHx units) and a comparison against poly( -
lactic acid) nanoparticles. No toxicity was observed 
for the PHA nanoparticles in the concentration range 
from 1 to 1000 μgmL−1. A comparison of drug release 
profiles of PHA nanoparticles and poly(lactic acid) 
nanoparticles shows that slower release was obtained 
in the case of former systems.
Encapsulation of a drug in nanoparticles seek to 
extend the drug half-life and thereby improve dos -
ing regimen, improve bioavailability or to enhance 
the transport properties of the drug. These goals are 
achieved using PHA-based nanoparticles in anti -
cancer therapy concerning TGX221, an inhibitor of 
phosphoinositide-3-kinases (Lu et al., 2011). Here, 
nanoparticles with average size of around 200nm 
were prepared from PHB, PHBV (5% HV) and 
PHBHx (12% HHx). These systems demonstrated 
that entrapment of TGX221, a PI3K inhibitor, ex -
tended its bioavailability and in vivo half-life.  Also, 
Ellipticine was encapsulated in nanoparticles formed 
from PHBV containing 5, 11 and 15% of HV units Table 1 . Survey of Drug Release Studies from PHA Matrices

of the inhibition of cell growth compared to free el -
lipticine by enhancing the bioavailability. Rapamicyn 
demonstrated better anti-proliferative effect after 
loading into PHBHx nanoparticles (Lu et al., 2014). 
Furthermore, PHA nanoparticles (PHBV containing 
12 and 50% of HV units) were successfully used in 
administering porphyrin 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-hy -

todynamic therapy (Pramual et al., 2016).
CONCLUSION
There has been an increased interest in PHA use 
in the delivery of drugs and other medical materi -
als due to their biodegradability, biocompatibility 
and non-toxicity. Industrial scale production cost of 
PHA has always been the impediment to the use of 
the polymer. Extensive efforts have been employed by 
researchers to drive down the cost by utilizing cheap 
and renewable carbon sources, which account for 
the bulk of the cost. This has made the replacement 
of synthetic plastics with these biodegradable ones 
promising. The appealing properties of the PHA have 
also attracted their use in cancer therapy and con -
trolled release formulations. Researches have been 
carried out, with success, on their use in the delivery 
of antitumor drugs, steroids and other biologically ac -
tive substances. The results of these works are a point -
er to a potential revolution in the use of PHA for drug 
delivery.
