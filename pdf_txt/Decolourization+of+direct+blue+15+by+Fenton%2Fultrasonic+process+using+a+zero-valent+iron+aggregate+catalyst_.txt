Abstract
In this study, loaded Luffa sponge  membrane forms were modified with ZnO, Fe3O4, ZnO/
Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) to remove of Direct Blue 15 (DB15), which is a carcinogenic azo 
dye in aqueous solution. ZnO and Fe3O4 NPs were synthesized using purified peroxidase 
enzymes from Euphorbia amygdaloides  using green synthesis method. Adsorption of DB15 
azo dyes was separately studied with membrane forms (LS-pure, LS-ZnO, LS-Fe3O4, 
and LS-ZnO/Fe3O4). Optimum contact time, optimum pH, optimum temperature, opti -
mum dye concentration, and optimum LS amount were found as 45 min, pH 8.0, 20°C, 
200 mg/L, and 0.025 g in line with the optimization studies, respectively. The obtained 
membrane forms were characterized using SEM, FT-IR, and XRD techniques. According 
to obtained results, NPs loaded LS membrane forms are promising in removal of DB15 
from textile wastewater contaminated water.

1. Introduction
There are more than 3000 different dyes available and half of them belong to the azo dyes 
compounds class [ 1]. Azo dyes are the most frequently used dyes in textile industry and 
are characterized by the presence of one or more azo linkages ( ─N═N─), usually in num -
ber of one or four, linked to phenyl and naphthyl radicals, which are usually replaced with 
some combinations of functional groups including: amino ( ─NH2), chlorine ( ─Cl), hydroxyl 
(─OH), methyl ( ─CH3), nitro ( ─NO2), sulfonic acid ( ─SO3H), and sodium salts ( ─SO3Na) 
[2–4]. These compounds can lead to significant ecological problems because of the creation

lead human bladder cancer, splenic sarcomas, and hepatocarcinoma, because azo dye reduc -
tion in the intestinal tract release aromatic amines which are absorbed by the intestine and 
excreted in the urine [ 8]. The acute toxicity of azo dyes, with respect to the criteria of the 
European Union for the sorting of unsafe substances, is low and the values of LD50 are  
250–2000 mg/kg body weight [ 9, 10].
The textile dyes can be removed by using physical, chemical, and biological methods [ 11]. 
Nevertheless, most of these methods, which simply accumulate or concentrate the dyes, and 
trigger secondary contamination, resulted in the extreme usage of chemical materials [ 11, 12].
Because of nanoparticles’ features arising from size effect, nanotechnology has emerged in 
many scientific and industrial fields [ 13, 14 ]. It involves studies of measurement, modeling, 
and manipulation of substance in nanoscale. Nanoremediation is economic and has improved 
overall efficiency of fragmentation process. Potential catalytic activity of Au, Ag, Pd, Mg, Cu, 
Zn, and Fe nanoparticles have been reported for degradation of some aqueous cationic and 
anionic dyes [ 14–18]. Researchers studied degradation of Methyl Orange, Sunset Yellow, Acid 
Blue A azo dyes using zero valent iron nanoparticles (NZVI) with diameters between 20 and 
110 nm. Methyl Orange, Sunset Yellow, Acid Red A were removed using solution prepared 
with 2 g NZVI rate of 79.9, 98.9, and 98.8, respectively [ 19].
However, nanoparticles are left in the ecosystem after their use in the removal of environmental 
contaminants. Thus, nanoparticles immobilized on a support material are to the fore for envi -
ronmental remediation [ 20, 21]. LS is eco-friendly, cost effective, easy to use matrix material suc -
cessfully used as a biotechnological tool for variety of systems, purposes and applications. LS 
immobilized cell systems have efficiently studied toward biofilm development for remediation of 
domestic and industrial wastewater containing toxic metal, paint, chlorinated compounds [22 , 32].
In this study, ZnO and Fe3O4 nanoparticles were obtained by catalyzing using purified peroxi -
dase enzymes from Euphorbia amygdaloides  with green synthesis method. Membrane forms have 
been created by immobilizing the obtained nanoparticles on LS support material. Carcinogenic 
DB15 azo dye was used to evaluate effectiveness of ones to remove dye (molecular structure 
of DB15 shown in Figure 1 ). Optimum contact time, pH, temperature, and concentration of 
dye were analyzed using UV-visible spectrometry. The resulting adsorbents (LS-pure, LS-ZnO, 
Figure 1.  Molecular structure of DB15.Iron Ores and Iron Oxide Materials 208LS-Fe3O4, and LS-ZnO/Fe3O4) were characterized by SEM, FT-IR, and XRD. Also, adsorption 
isotherms and kinetics and thermodynamics of these membrane forms were investigated.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
Direct Blue 15 (CAS no: 2429-74-5), FeCl2, ZnCI2, and other chemicals were purchased from 
Sigma-Aldrich. Euphorbia ( Euphorbia amygdaloides ) was collected from near the town of 
Hasankale of Erzurum. Also, LS which is fruit of Luffa cylindrica  was obtained from a local 
point of spices sale in Erzurum, Turkey, and they were identified with the helping of taxono -
mists. All solutions were made in deionized water.
2.2. Green synthesis of Fe3O4 and ZnO nanoparticles
2.2.1. Collection of plant sample and preparation of plants extract
Plants ( Euphorbia amygdaloides ) were collected from Hasankale town of Erzurum city. They were 
washed with distilled water several times for cleaning dust and soil on plants. Then, plants 
were cut into small pieces. Small pieces (50 g) were thoroughly shattered to form a homoge -
neous mixture in blender using 250 mL, 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0). Then, it was 
centrifuged at 5000× g for 10 min and the supernatant was used for enzyme purification [23 ].
2.2.2. Partial purification of the peroxidase enzyme with ammonium sulfate precipitation
Prepared Euphorbia ( Euphorbia amygdaloides ) plant homogenate was saturated from 60 to 
80% with ammonium sulfate, then the peroxidase enzyme was precipitated by centrifuged 
at 8000× g, 10 min. Obtained precipitate was dissolved at 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer 
(pH 6.0) and was incubated at 4°C for further analysis [23 ].
2.2.3. Peroxidase enzyme activity test
Determination of peroxidase activity was made by substrate of 1 mM 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethyl -
benzthiazoline-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABST) prepared in 0.1 M phosphate buffer 
at pH 6. For this purpose, 2.8 mL ABST was transferred to a test tube, and then the reaction 
mixture was formed by the addition 100 μL of 80% enzyme and 100 μL of 3.2 mM H2O2 solu -
tion into the test tube. The change in absorbance was monitored at 412 nm using UV–Visible 
spectrophotometer at 1 min intervals for 3 min. Blank test tube was prepared using distilled 
water instead of enzyme in the reaction mixture.
2.2.4. Synthesis of Fe3O4 and ZnO nanoparticles
100 μL of purified peroxidase enzyme from Euphorbia ( Euphorbia amygdaloides ) plant were 
added in sample FeCl2 of solution (2.9 mL, 10 mM) and incubated in a closed space for 4 h. The Investigation of Removing Direct Blue 15 Dye from Wastewater Using Magnetic Luffa sponge  NPs
http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.73216209The solution was becoming dark red, which indicates the presence of Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The 
same procedures were repeated using 2.9 mL of 10 mM ZnCl2 solution to obtain ZnO nanopar -
ticles. The solution became a white turbid state indicating the presence of ZnO nanoparticles. 
Then, water was removed by the help of an evaporator, and synthesized iron and zinc oxide 
nanoparticles were dried at 70°C for 24 h.
2.2.5. Characterization of Fe3O4 and ZnO nanoparticles
Synthesized Fe3O4 and ZnO NPs were characterized by scanning at range of 200–1000 nm 
by using UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Epoch nanodrop spectrophotometer). Determination 
of topography for Fe3O4 and ZnO nanoparticles was performed by SEM (Scanning Electron 
Microscope). In addition, XRD analysis (X-ray diffraction analysis) and FT-IR (Fourier trans -
form infrared spectroscopy) were performed for Fe3O4 and ZnO NPs.
Contact time, pH, temperature, and metal ion concentration were determined for the pur -
pose of optimization synthesized Fe3O4 and ZnO NPs. For determination of the optimum 
contact time, samples were spectrophotometrically measured between 0 and 240 min with 
3 min intervals. Synthesis of Fe3O4 and ZnO NPs was performed in sodium phosphate buffer 
at pH 2.0–3.0, sodium acetate buffer at pH 4.0–6.0, sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0–8.0 
and sodium carbonate buffer at pH 9.0–11.0 and the values of absorbance were measured. pH 
was adjusted by using 0.1 N HCl and 0.1 N NaOH. Synthesis of NPs was separately carried 
out from 10° to 90°C, respectively, and changes in absorbants of the samples were measured. 
Synthesis of NPs was performed by using related solution at 0.5, 1, 3, 5, and 7 mM and the 
absorbance of samples was measured. All measurements were performed by UV–VIS spectro -
photometer and deionized water was used for blank sample.
2.3. Preparation of LS material, immobilization of nanoparticles procedure
Dried LS material was made into small pieces and was autoclaved for 20 min to soften the 
fibrous structure. Then, it was transformed into dough using blender. It was incubated for 4 h 
with 1 N NaOH at 80°C. Then, the fibers were collected and were thoroughly washed with 
distilled water until NaOH is resolved. About 0.1% hypochlorite was used for decoloration 
of washed fibers and then, they were washed with distilled water. Fibers with the length of 
10–50 μm were collected and were dispersed with distilled water to form a suspension form. 
The suspension was filtered under aseptic conditions using filter paper and obtained LS fibers 
were dried on filter paper at 40°C for 4 h [24 ]. Immobilization was performed by treatment 
solutions containing Fe3O4 and ZnO NPs with LS which was pretreated in ultrasonic bath for 
1 h. Then, the obtained membrane forms (LS-pure, LS-ZnO, LS-Fe3O4, LS-ZnO/Fe3O4) was 
dried in oven for 2 h.
2.4. Azo dye remediation
The prepared membranes were used for decolorization of DB15 solution which was prepared 
in the laboratory. Synthetic wastewater was prepared by dissolving DB15 dye. A calibration Iron Ores and Iron Oxide Materials 210curve was prepared in the range 0–40 ng/cm3 of DB15. The reaction mixture was prepared 
by adding membrane forms and in flasks containing 50 mL volume DB15 dye solution. The 
samples were taken out from the flasks periodically with a micropipette and were centrifuged 
at 5000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant solutions were filtered with 0.45 mm filters. Then, 
the concentration of DB15 was measured with a UV–VIS spectrophotometer at λ = 596 nm. 
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to examine the surface of the adsorbents 
before and after dye adsorption (JEOL JSM-6400 SEM) and FTIR, XRD were performed for 
dye adsorption. Optimum contact time, pH, temperature, concentration of dye to determine 
optimal conditions for the decolorization of DB15 azo dye were analyzed using UV-Visible 
spectrophotometer.
The amounts of the dyes adsorbed onto LS-pure, LS-ZnO, LS-Fe3O4, and LS-ZnO/Fe3O4 (qe in 
mg/g) were calculated from the equation:
   q  e   =    ( C  o   −  C  e  )  × V _________  m    (1)
where Co and Ce are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of dye in solution (mg/L); V is 
the volume of solution (L) and m is the mass of adsorbent (g).
2.5. Adsorption isotherms
Plots of ln( C/Co) and time were drawn to estimate rate constants (k values) for decolorization 
as a function of dye concentration, where Co and C represent remaining color intensity at the 
start of the experiment (zero time) and at any time t, respectively, for various fixed concentra -
tions of dye.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Partial obtaining peroxidase enzyme from Euphorbia amygdaloides  plant
The data obtained in the purification process of peroxidase enzyme are given in Table 1 .
There are many studies on the purification of peroxidase enzyme in the literature. Plants such 
as wheat seeds, barley and wheat, soybeans, fava beans, sorghum, watermelon seeds, red 
beets, cotton, pearl millet seedlings, Asian rice, lettuce, wild radish, and pearl barley hybrids 
were used for the purification of peroxidase enzyme [25 –29].
Peroxidase enzyme was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation from Euphorbia amygda -
loides  plant with CM-cellulose ion exchange chromatography and Sephacryl S-100 gel filtration 
chromatography. According to the data obtained in 75% ammonium sulfate precipitation step, 
the enzyme was purified with purification coefficient of 6.4 and 51.6 for 10 mL volume [23 ]. In 
our study, the enzyme was purified with a purification coefficient of 149.5 and a yield of 29.5 
for 20 mL volume, according to the order of 60–80% ammonium sulfate precipitation step.The Investigation of Removing Direct Blue 15 Dye from Wastewater Using Magnetic Luffa sponge  NPs

The results of the optimization studies for the green synthesis of nanoparticles are given in 
Table 2 .
No research has been found in the literature on the green synthesis of Fe3O4 and ZnO NPs from 
the Euphorbia amygdaloides  plant. Euphorbia milii  was used for the synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles 
[30]. A study on the green synthesis of the Fe3O4 nanoparticle using the Euphorbia amygdaloides  
plant is not available in the literature. However, studies on the green synthesis of Pd/Fe3O4 
nanoparticles using Euphorbia condylocarpa M. bieb  root extract and Euphorbia stracheyi Boiss  root 
extract have been carried out [ 31]. Our study provides a contribution to the literature. The high -
est peak in the optical absorption spectrum of the ZnO nanoparticles synthesized by pulsed 
laser ablation was at 300 nm [32]. In our study, the highest peak value of ZnO nanoparticles was 
read at 304 nm ( Table 2 ). The sharpness of ZnO absorption indicates the uniform nanoparticle 
distribution [ 33, 34 ]. Fe3O4 nanoparticles exhibit an absorption band in the range of 330–450 nm 
of the UV–Vis spectrum in the literature and Fe3O4 nanoparticles peak observed at 330 nm in 
a work [ 35]. The highest peak value of the Fe3O4 nanoparticles used in our study was read as 
481 nm. This range is above the range available in the literature. Nagarajan and Kuppusamy 
[36] studied the optical properties of ZnO nanoparticles obtained from marine algae of Mannar 
Bay in India. They did not observe any peak between pH 5.0–7.0 and pH 9.0–10.0 in their 
pH optimization studies. The maximum yield was obtained at pH 8.0. In our study, pH 6.0 
was determined as the optimum pH for ZnO nanoparticle synthesis. Optimum pH for Fe3O4 
nanoparticles is found at 8.0. Manouchehr et al. [ 37] reported that they performed the synthesis 
of Fe3O4 nanoparticles in the pH 7.0–9.0 environment. These values are close to the values we 
have obtained in our study. While the highest absorbance values were obtained at a concentra -
tion of 5 mM ZnCl2 in the synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles, the highest absorbance values were 
obtained at a concentration of 1 mM FeCl2-Fe2Cl3 in the synthesis of Fe3O4 nanoparticles.

Table 1.  Purification process of peroxidase enzyme from Euphorbia amygdaloides  plant.Iron Ores and Iron Oxide Materials 212SEM (scanning electron microscope) basically works on the basis of obtaining the images of 
the surface morphology which are scanned with the help of electrons. The electrons sourced 
from tungsten tip are sent to the surface to be scanned. After that, the emitted electrons 
are captured by the detector and the image is formed. SEM analysis images of ZnO and 
Fe3O4 nanoparticles in this study taken in this way are shown in Figure 2 . The SEM image 
recorded for the Fe3O4 nanoparticle structure resembled a dust particle, suggesting that it 
may be a soft structure. It has been determined that these nanoparticle structures obtained 
by the surface characterization process have an average size of 30–80 nm. The SEM image 
for ZnO nanoparticle was taken at 5 μm. In this image, the nanoparticle structure exhibits a 
wavier surface. Generally, the liquid containing peroxidase enzyme prevents the formation 
of ZnO nanoparticle formations composed of dust and flake-like structures. However, it 
appears that the powder and flake structures combine in some regions and exhibit a wavy 
appearance after this enzyme liquid is evaporated. After the surface characterization analy -
sis of ZnO nanoparticles, it was found that these structures vary between 60 and 80 nm on 
average.
The Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrophotometer (FTIR) is used to determine the bond for -
mation between the elements present in the structure to be measured. In this direction, the 
structural formation that the sample possesses can be understood by measuring the vibra -
tions of the bond occurrences in the structure at certain frequencies. This helps in the determi -
nation of the functional groups in the material being measured. The FT-IR spectrums of ZnO 
and Fe3O4 nanoparticles are given in Figure 3 .
When looking at Figure 3A , it is possible to observe the absorbance at 510–564 cm−1, which is 
indicative of Zn-O band formation in this analysis which was carried out to detect the biomole -
cule by revealing the stabilization ability and bandwidth of the metal nanoparticles synthesized 
by green synthesis [ 38]. Geetha et al. [ 30] synthesized ZnO nanoparticles by green synthesis 
using the Euphorbia spindle  plant. They applied FT-IR analysis in their characterization studies 
Figure 2.  SEM analysis images of ZnO and Fe3O4 nanoparticles.The Investigation of Removing Direct Blue 15 Dye from Wastewater Using Magnetic Luffa sponge  NPs
http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.73216213in the range of 400–4500 cm−1. The researchers noted that the observed transmittance band at 
435 cm−1 corresponds to ZnO bonding, confirming the formation of ZnO particles.
In the FT-IR spectrum of the Fe3O4 nanoparticle structure shown in Figure 3B , there are oscil -
lations of bond structures that oxygen forms with iron. It is known that this nanoparticle 
structure oscillates between 200 and 650 cm−1. In this direction, as shown in the graph, the 
Fe3O4 nanoparticle structure obtained by green synthesis exhibited oscillations indicating spe -
cific bonds between iron and oxygen elements between 256 cm and 636 cm−1.
XRD (X-ray diffraction) method was used for the analysis of crystallized structures of 
nanoparticles used in the study. In this method, since the diffraction pattern to be produced 
by each structure will be different, the planar structure of the elements arranged symmetri -
cally or periodically can be determined. The graphs obtained by XRD analysis of ZnO and 
Fe3O4 nanoparticles are given in Figure 4 .
Plots of 100, 002, 101, 102, 110, 103, 200, 112, 201, 004, and 202 were determined in the XRD 
analysis graph to show the crystallized structure of the ZnO nanoparticle. ZnO nanoparticle

Figure 3.  FTIR spectrum of (A) ZnO and (B) Fe3O4 nanoparticle.Iron Ores and Iron Oxide Materials 214structures are located at 2θ angles of 31.77, 34.40, 36.22, 47.61, 56.58, 62.85, 66.41, 67.93, 69.08, 
72.54, and 76.85° corresponding to the plane distances of the atoms present in the structure of 
the nanoparticle. In this case, the XRD chart confirms that the nanoparticle we are analyzing 
is a ZnO nanoparticle.
Nearly all of the characterization studies for ZnO nanoparticles synthesized by different 
methods in the literature are discussed according to XRD analysis results. In the analyses, the 
planes are generally observed at the highest peak 101 with the planes of 100, 002, 101, 102, 110, 
103, 112 [30 , 39]. In parallel with these studies in the XRD spectrum we obtained in our study, 
the 101 plane has the highest peak.
The peaks obtained in the XRD spectrum of the Fe3O4 nanoparticles reveal that the desired 
nanoparticle structure is obtained in the green synthesis process carried out. 2θ values specific 
to this nanoparticle were determined as 30, 33, 44, 53, 56, and 62°.The distances between the 
planes determined in this direction are 220, 311, 400, 422, 511, and 440 respectively. In the light 
of this information, it is determined that the Fe3O4 nanoparticle structure is in a spherical crystal 
structure.
3.3. Immobilization efficiency
The data obtained for the immobilization of nanoparticles on the LS are given in Table 3 .
3.4. Adsorption studies
Analytical methods used for quantitative analysis require calibration. Calibration is a process 
for accurately determining the relationship between the signal measured at the output of 
any device and the concentration of the material causing the signal. The curve obtained is a 
straight line. Since the calibration curve R2 value is 0.9941, the slope is assumed to be 0.0094.
As seen in Figure 5 , the DB15 azo dye had value of about qe = 80 mg/L with all membrane 
forms in the first 15 min. Measurements at 30, 45, and 60 min resulted in 80–100 mg/L qe. 
However, since the highest values were noted at 45 min, optimum contact time for this azo 
dye was accepted as 45 min. ZnO and Fe3O4 NPs have been used to study the remodeling 
of many azo dyes [ 40, 41]. The LS-ZnO membrane form provided slightly lower adsorption 
compared to the LS-Fe3O4 NPs membrane form. The highest adsorption was obtained with 
LS-ZnO/Fe3O4 NPs membrane form.

http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.73216215Maximum adsorption peaks were observed at pH 8.0 in the spectrophotometric measure -
ments performed on pH optimizations for the adsorption of DB15 azo dye solution at 
50 mg/L concentration with the formed membrane forms. According to adsorption data 
obtained with LS-ZnO NPs and LS-Fe3O4 NPs membrane forms in pH 7.0 medium, pure LS 
membrane form provides a more effective adsorption in this pH environment. However, at 
pH 7.0, the same adsorption data were observed for LS-ZnO/Fe3O4 NPs and pure LS mem -
brane forms ( Figure 5 ).
In some studies performed onto Fenton process, a high decolorization rate was achieved for 
DB15 azo dye in highly acidic media such as pH 3.0 and 4.0 [42 , 43]. Providing maximum 
yield in alkaline environment such as pH 8.0 near neutral with the formed membrane forms 
is advantageous in terms of operating.
The adsorption of the DB15 azo dye solution with membrane form exhibited the highest 
adsorption peaks at 20°C. However, when the temperature was gradually increased above 
20°C, the adsorption with membrane forms showed an inverse proportion and gradually 
decreased. This result is quite advantageous in terms of the industrial application because the 
approximate temperature of 20°C is accepted as the optimum value.
Figure 5.  The effects of contact time, pH, temperature and dye concentration on the adsorption of the DB15 azo dye 
solution with the formed membrane forms.Iron Ores and Iron Oxide Materials 216In the work for the degradation of DB15 azo dye using copper hydroxide nitrate as a catalyst 
by wet peroxide oxidation, it has been reported that degradation activity of 85 and 90% of this 
dye is obtained after 10 and 60 min at 60°C [ 44]. In another study, remediation of DB15 azo 
dye was studied with Fenton reaction, and in this study, the degradation efficiency of the sys -
tem was increased in parallel with the temperature increasing from 20 to 40°C [42]. The tem -
peratures in these studies are very high and cause extra energy consumption and therefore 
financial loss. In this respect, the membrane forms proposed in our work offer advantages at 
20°C with effective performance.
When Figure 6  is examined, the adsorption of concentration of 200 mg/L DB15 azo dye solu -
tion prepared with the membrane forms had the highest value. The adsorption of the DB15 azo 
dye solution prepared at the concentration of 200 mg/L with LS-ZnO NPs, LS-Fe3O4 NPs, and 
LS-ZnO/Fe3O4 NPs membrane forms showed the highest values were measured according to the 
adsorption of azo dye solutions prepared at other concentrations (10, 25, 50, and 100 mg/L). The 
use of nanoparticles has affected adsorption quite positively. Pure LS membrane form showed 
very low efficiency in dye adsorption compared to nanoparticle loaded membrane forms.
Adsorption values were read close to each other in the adsorption study of the DB15 azo dye 
solution with membrane forms formed with LS quantities of 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 g. In 
the adsorption study of azo dye solution with nanoparticle-loaded membrane forms formed 
with all LS quantities used in the experiment, higher adsorption values were obtained com -
pared to the pure LS membrane form used in the same amount. The highest percentage of 
recovery was obtained with 0.025 g LS ( Figure 6 ). Kesraoui et al. [ 45] conducted biosorption 
of the Alpasit Blue with LS. In this study, maximum efficiency was obtained with 1 g LS fibrils 
after 2 h in pH 2.0 medium with 20mg/L concentration dye. In our study, the highest yield was 
achieved with an adsorbent amount of 0.025 g. In addition, nanoparticle loading has made this 
more efficient.

http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.732162173.5. Characterization studies of dye absorption with prepared nanoparticle loaded 
membrane forms
SEM images for the adsorption of DB15 azo dye with the membrane forms obtained in the 
study are given in Figure 7 . SEM images were taken at a size of 10 μm at 8000× magnification. 
It is seen that the DB15 azo dye has drained the membrane forms like a cover.
As shown in Figure 8 , membrane forms formed with LS material exhibit significant peaks, 
especially at permeability of 1000 cm−1. At the same time, certain peaks were observed at 
about 500 and around 3350 cm−1. In fact, FT-IR bands specific to the cellulose structure of LS 
seen here. C ─H bands and ─OH groups are found at around 3350 and 2800–2900 cm−1 [46, 
47]. In the adsorption of DB15 azo dye with LS membrane forms, FT-IR bands were observed 
especially for Fe3O4 nanoparticle-loaded membrane forms. ZnO NPs loaded membrane had 
higher permeability to dye adsorption than other membrane types.
The XRD spectrum of the LS membrane form showed peaks at 2θ = 15, 20, and 38 areas. The 
peak intensity is above 30,000 in the area 2θ = 20. However, in the XRD spectrum of DB15 
azo dye adsorption with this membrane form, the 2θ = 20 area shifted to 2θ = 22 and the peak 
intensity approached 60.000 in this area. In addition, additional peak was observed at 2θ = 35, 
38, 43, and 50 areas. Nanoparticle-loaded membrane forms exhibited significant changes in 
XRD spectra when DB15 azo dye adsorbed with these membrane forms. These membrane 
forms exhibited very low XRD peaks compared to the pure LS membrane form, but they 
exhibited very high XRD peaks especially in the 2θ = 15 and 20 areas after dye adsorption. A 
distinctive feature of ZnO and Fe3O4 NPs in the adsorption of this azo dye was not observed 
in the XRD spectrum. The values were very close to each other ( Figure 8 ) [47–49].
3.6. Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherm studies
The following Langmuir isotherm equation is used to plot Langmuir adsorption isotherm 
graphs for the adsorption of DB15 azo dye with the membrane forms in this study. The cor -
relation between    Ce ___ qe    and Ce calculated from experimental results is given in Figure 9 .
    Ce ___  q  e     =   1 ____ k  V  m     +    C  e   ________  V  m       (2)
Using the following Freundlich adsorption isotherm equation, Freundlich adsorption iso -
therm graph for the adsorption of DB15 azo dyes of the working membrane forms was drawn. 
This graph showing the relation between log qe and log Ce was given in Figure 9 .
  log  q  e   = log  K  F   +   1 __ n   log  C  e    (3)
The Langmuir adsorption isotherm is generally used to describe the maximum adsorption 
capacity of an adsorbent. qm and b values were calculated from the above equation. b is a 
constant related to adsorption net enthalpy (L/mg), and qm is the amount of adsorbed mate -
rial (mg/g) in the unit weight of the adsorbent to form a single layer at the surface. In the 
Langmuir isotherm study, the highest qm value was obtained LS-ZnO/Fe3O4 membrane form Iron Ores and Iron Oxide Materials 218with 274.6 mg/g and the lowest qm value was obtained with pure LS membrane form with 
45.0 mg/g. The highest b value was achieved with the pure LS membrane form with 1.186 L/mg  
and the LS-ZnO/Fe3O4 NPs membrane form with a minimum b value of 0.06 L/mg. High

http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.73216219correlation coefficient R2 (0.9605) was provided with Langmuir model, the linear form appli -
cation for LS-Fe3O4. This indicates that the sorption system of Langmuir isotherm provides a 
good model for this membrane form ( Table 4 ).
Freundlich isotherm model is an empirical relationship that defines the adsorption of solu -
bles from a liquid to a solid surface and assumes that there are different areas with several 
adsorption energies. Freundlich constants are related to the sorption capacity of the adsorbent 
(mg/g) and adsorption energy. In the Freundlich model, KF and n are constants that show the 
adsorption capacity and intensity, respectively. High KF and n values indicate high adsorp -
tion capacity and magnitude of n value is an indication of the suitability of adsorption. The 
LS-ZnO NPs membrane form with 2.65 values of n had a good adsorption capacity relative 
to the Freundlich isotherm. The pure LS membrane form is quite advantageous according to 
R2 (0.9885) ( Table 4 ).
3.7. Reaction kinetics of first and second order
The adsorption kinetics of DB15 azo dye with LS, LS-ZnO NPs, LS-Fe3O4 NPs, LS-ZnO/Fe3O4 
NPs membrane forms and were investigated against 10, 25, 50, 100, and 200 mg/L concentra -
tions of dye solutions. To determine the adsorption constants, first order conformity to reaction 
Figure 8.  FT-IR and XRD spectrums of adsorption of DB15 azo dye with membrane forms.
Figure 9.  Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherm for DB15 azo dye adsorption with membrane forms.Iron Ores and Iron Oxide Materials 220kinetics was investigated. For this purpose, the time-dependence of ln( qe − qt) was plotted and 
R2 values were calculated for 10, 25, and 50 mg/L concentrations of dye ( Table 5 ).
The k1 constant is calculated using the first order reaction equation given below:
  ln  ( q  e   −  q  t  )  = ln  q  e   −  k  1   t  (4)
Then, its suitability of second-order reaction kinetics was investigated to calculate the adsorp -
tion constants of DB15 azo dye. (t/qt) depicting the time dependence graphs were plotted and 
R2 values for 10, 25, and 50 mg/L concentrations of DB15 azo dyes were calculated ( Table 5 ).
The second-order reaction equation is used to calculate the k2 constant and all calculated 
values (qeexperimental, qecalculated, k1, k2, R2) for adsorption of azo dye DB15 are shown in Table 5 .
When Table 5  is examined, there is high difference between values of qeexperimental and qecalculated 
in the reaction kinetics of the first- and second-order in dye adsorption with pure LS membrane 
form. Furthermore, when the R2 values are examined, it is clear that the second order is inad -
equate. There is lower difference than the other concentration between values of qeexperimental and 
qecalculated in reaction kinetics of the second order in adsorption of azo dye at a concentration of 
10 mg/L with the LS-ZnO NPs membrane form. However, when we take into account the R2 
values, there is a compatibility with the first-order reaction kinetics. We see that the adsorption 
of azo dye at 25 mg/L concentration with Fe3O4 NPs-loaded membrane forms is more appropri -
ate for the second-order reaction kinetics in terms of R2 values.

azo dye are given in Figure 10 .

is spontaneously. The negative values of ΔH° confirm the exothermic structure of the adsorp -

4. Conclusion
In this study on remediation, the possibilities offered by the environment are evaluated. ZnO 
and Fe3O4 NPs were produced by green synthesis with catalyzed peroxidase enzyme partially 
purified from Euphorbia amygdaloides  plant. In this phase of the study, a new plant source was 
presented to literature for the green synthesis of nanoparticles. It has also been shown that 
produced nanoparticles may play an active role in dye adsorption. The synthesis of this plant 
with other nanoparticles will be further studied.
LS is a natural plant that can grow in many countries, can be used for many purposes, and has 
recently undergone a lot of research. In this study, nanoparticles were immobilized success -
fully on this material. In this way, it is aimed to prevent the nanoparticles accumulation in the 
environment and the creation of a separate pollution. Adsorption of DB15, a carcinogenic azo 
dye, was studied with nanoparticle-loaded membrane forms. Optimization, characterization, 
kinetic, thermodynamic studies demonstrated effectiveness of the membrane forms used in 
dye adsorption. For this reason, we can easily say that this work will be a source for commer -
cialized membrane systems in the future.DB15
