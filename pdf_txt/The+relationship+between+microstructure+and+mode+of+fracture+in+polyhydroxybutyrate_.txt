Abstract: Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate- co-3-valerate) (PHBV), being one of the most studied and com-
mercially available polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), presents an intrinsic brittleness and narrow
processing window that currently hinders its use in several plastic applications. The aim of this study
was to develop a biodegradable PHA-based blend by combining PHBV with poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-
co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) (PHBH), another copolyester of the PHA family that shows a more ductile
behavior. Blends of PHBV with 20% wt., 30% wt., and 40% wt. of PHBH were obtained by melt
mixing, processed by cast extrusion in the form of ﬁlms, and characterized in terms of their mor-
phology, crystallization behavior, thermal stability, mechanical properties, and thermoformability.
Full miscibility of both biopolymers was observed in the amorphous phase due to the presence of a
single delta peak, ranging from 4.5C to 13.7C. Moreover, the incorporation of PHBH hindered
the crystallization process of PHBV by decreasing the spherulite growth rate from 1.0 m/min to
0.3m/min . However, for the entire composition range studied, the high brittleness of the resulting
materials remained since the presence of PHBH did not prevent the PHBV crystalline phase from gov-
erning the mechanical behavior of the blend. Interestingly, the addition of PHBH greatly improved
the thermoformability by widening the processing window of PHBV by 7 s, as a result of the increase
in the melt strength of the blends even for the lowest PHBH content.

1. Introduction
Plastics are key materials in our daily lives, growing every year both in presence
and relevance. At the same time, there is also a growing concern about the negative
environmental impact they cause throughout their whole lifecycle: from their origin and
production to their eventual disposal [ 1], making their correct waste management of the
utmost importance. Moreover, around 46% of global plastic waste comes from the food-
packaging sector and single-use products, with lifetimes that are generally just a few weeks
and even days in some cases [2].
Therefore, food-packaging products result in a considerable and continuous source
of domestic plastic waste. Plastic materials generally exhibit high chemical stability and
inertness, both characteristics of interest in the packaging sector, but this, in turn, results in
Polymers 2022 ,14, 2527. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym14132527 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymersPolymers 2022 ,14, 2527 2 of 24
a high permanence and accumulation of their residues, thus rendering an environmental
problem when they are not correctly managed [ 3–5]. In this regard, the plastic-pollution
concern has led to authorities implementing restrictive policies and regulations for banning
single-use products and bags [ 5,6]. As a consequence, the development of alternative
materials to replace commodities currently represents a priority for both industry and
academia. In this regard, bioplastics became an interesting option for this target due to
their sustainable and eco-friendly attributes [6].
In this context, polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are one of the most promising bioplas-
tics because of their triple bio-advantages: bio-based, biodegradable, and biocompatibility.
PHAs are a family of thermoplastic biopolyesters, naturally synthesized as an intracel-
lular storage product by microorganisms under certain adverse feeding conditions [ 7].
PHA-producing microorganisms can be fed with pure and controlled feedstock, as well as
organic waste or by-products from the agri-food sector (i.e., cheese whey, coffee grounds,
etc.), thus rendering a fully renewable, low carbon-footprint material, while contributing
to the promotion of the so-called Circular Bioeconomy [ 8,9]. On the other hand, PHAs
have demonstrated to be fully degradable by microorganisms in all aerobic- and anaerobic-
relevant environments (industrial compost, home compost, soil, seawater, landﬁll) at a
fast rate, thus being deﬁned as biodegradable materials in accordance with international
standards [ 10]. Furthermore, biocompatibility makes them suitable for medical applications
such as tissue engineering or drug delivery [11,12].
Since their ﬁrst observation by Lemoigne in 1926 [ 13], more than 150 monomers featur-
ing in PHA alone (homopolymers) or in combination (copolymers) have been reported [ 14].
However, only a few of these biopolyesters are commercially available, and, among
them, the most extended ones are poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB), poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-
co-4-hydroxybutyrate) (P3HB- co-4HB), poly(3-hydroxybutyrate- co-3-hydroxyhexanoate)
(PHBH), and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate- co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) [ 15]. The physical
and chemical properties of PHAs range broadly depending on the structure of their con-
stituent monomers. Based on the chain length (CL) of the monomers they are made from,
PHAs can be categorized into three groups: short (SCL-PHA, 3-5 carbon atoms), medium
(MCL-PHA, 6-14 C), and long (LCL-PHA, >15 C). Generally, SCL-PHAs are rigid, brittle,
and high-crystalline thermoplastics, while MCL- and LCL-PHAs are ﬂexible, ductile, and
show lower crystallinity [16].
PHBV is an SCL-PHA with high crystallinity. It possesses a good mechanical perfor-
mance in terms of stiffness and strength, being comparable to polypropylene (PP), and
having good barrier properties similar to polyethylene terephthalate (PET) [ 17]. In order to
improve the thermal stability and allow better processability, copolymers with different
contents of 3-hydroxyvalerate (3HV) are produced. However, both PHB and PHBV poly-
mers with low 3HV contents present a major weakness for plastic applications: an intrinsic
fragility that increases over time due to a second crystallization and physical ageing phe-
nomenon [ 18]. Furthermore, their high crystallinity results in a narrow processing window,
thus hindering their processability in conventional industrial equipment [19].
A great deal of effort has been devoted to overcoming the shortcomings of PHB and
PHBV for plastic applications, highlighting blending with other resins as a useful way of
obtaining new materials with improved properties and compatible with industrial pro-
cesses [ 20]. Works with both biodegradable [polylactide (PLA) [ 21], poly(butylene adipate
terephthalate) (PBAT) [ 22], poly( #-caprolactone) (PCL) [ 23], poly(propylene carbonate)
(PPC) [ 24], and poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) [ 25]] as well as non-biodegradable polymers
[such as poly(ethylene- co-vinyl acetate) (EVA) [ 26], polyethylene oxide (PEO) [ 27], and
thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) [ 28]] can be found in the literature. The polymer blends
render materials with enhanced properties in terms of ﬂexibility, processing temperature
window, or toughness. However, all of these blends are immiscible and, therefore, the
mixing conditions are a key factor to ensure a good interaction between the two poly-
mers in the blend. For instance, Phua et al. [ 29] blended PHBV with PBS and achieved
no improvement in the mechanical properties. In these cases, the use of compatibilizingPolymers 2022 ,14, 2527 3 of 24
agents may help to generate a convenient morphology, resulting in an improvement in the
mechanical performance.
In this sense, previous works of the group regarding PHBV blended with TPU found
that it was necessary to use epoxy-based reactive agents (TGIC or Joncryl®) to improve the
elongation at break and toughness without compromising tensile strength and modulus
of elasticity [ 28,30]. The original drop-in-matrix morphology was modiﬁed to lower the
droplet size and lower ligament thickness, with the addition of compatibilizing agents in
blends with TPU contents >20%.
However, blending PHA with other polymers (even if biodegradable), and the use
of compatibilizers, could limit the biodegradability of the so-obtained blend in some en-
vironments in which the biopolymer was originally biodegradable [ 31,32]. For instance,
the biodegradability of PHBV/PPC blends in soil was restricted to the PHBV fraction, in
accordance with the results reported by Tao et al. [33]. Weng et al. [34] also found that the
biodegradability of PHBV/PLA mulch ﬁlms was limited to thermophilic-composting condi-
tions due to the presence of PLA. In seawater, a PHB/PBAT bag showed no relevant marine
biodegradation, whereas neat PHB fully degraded [ 35]. Therefore, the biodegradability of
PHBV in a wide range of environments should be preserved.
For this, PHBH will be an interesting candidate since this MCL-PHA is a random
copolymer of 3HB and 3-hydroxyhexanoate (3HH) units that possesses a ductile nature
and a wider processing window compared to the homopolymer PHB [ 36]. Due to its low
crystallinity, PHBH shows excellent ﬂexibility and elongation at break, but a low Young’s
modulus and tensile strength [ 36,37]. This strategy has been previously used by Nerkar
et al. [ 38] by blending PHB with a different MCL-PHA, poly(3-hydroxyoctanoate) (PHO).
Lower crystallinity and enhanced mechanical properties were obtained, which were even
better after adding a cross-linking peroxide initiator during processing. More recently,
Frone et al. [ 39] also succeeded by using 10% wt. to 20% wt. of own-biosynthesized PHO,
as a toughening agent for PHB, while preserving the biodegradability and biocompatibility
of the material.
From the above, this study aims to ascertain the properties of PHBV/PHBH blends as
well as SCL- and MCL-PHAs with a priori good miscibility but opposite properties. These
novel PHA blends represent a convenient approach to improving the mechanical properties
and the processability of the PHA biopolymers, without compromising their biodegradabil-
ity. To this end, three different PHBV:PHBH compositions in % wt. (80:20, 70:30, 60:40) were
produced, characterized, and compared to the neat biopolymers. The effect of increasing
the PHBH content on the morphology, crystallization, processability, thermal, and mechani-
cal properties of PHBV was analyzed. The characterization of the materials was carried out
by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC),
wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS), polarized optical microscopy (POM), dynamic me-
chanical analysis (DMA), melt-ﬂow index (MFI), and thermogravimetrical analysis (TGA).
The mechanical performance was evaluated by tensile, tearing, and thermoformability
tests. Additionally, the preservation of biodegradability in a marine environment was
also corroborated.

triﬂuoroethanol (TFE) (synthesis grade, density 1.389 g/cm3) was acquired from Sigma-
Aldrich S.A. (Madrid, Spain) and used for polarized optical microscopy (POM)-sample
preparation. Puriﬁed alpha-cellulose ﬁber, grade TC40 (cellulose content > 99.6%) from
CreaFill Fibers Corp. (Chestertown, MD, USA), was used as the reference material for the
marine-biodegradation test. Natural seawater for biodegradation study was kindly pro-Polymers 2022 ,14, 2527 4 of 24

the Catholic University of Valencia located in Calpe (Alicante, Spain). The seawater was
enriched with ammonium chloride (NH 4Cl, purity 99.5%) and potassium dihydrogen
phosphate (KH 2PO4, purity 99.0%), in accordance with ASTM D 6691 recommendations.
Both reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich S.A. and used as received.
2.2. Sample Preparation
A scheme of sample preparation can be found in Figure 1. From 100% PHBV to 100%
PHBH, three blends of a decreasing PHBV/PHBH weight ratio were prepared in a Haisin TSE-
20B (Nanjing, Jiangsu, China) co-rotating twin-screw extruder ( Ø = 22 mm , L/D ratio = 32–44 ).
Prior to the blending step, the biopolymers used in this study were dried at 60C for at least 8 h
in a Piovan DPA 10 dehumidifying dryer (Santa Maria di Sala, VE, Italy). The temperature pro-
file of the extruder was set at 185C/175C/170C/170C/170C/170C/175C/180C
from hopper to nozzle, resulting in a melt temperature at the die of 172–173C, and the ro-
tation speed was 200 rpm. All the components were manually dry-mixed before extrusion.
The extruded material was cooled in a water bath and pelletized.

A scheme of sample preparation can be foun d in Figure 1. From 100% PHBV to 100% 
PHBH, three blends of a decreasing PHBV/PHB H weight ratio were prepared in a Haisin 
TSE-20B (Nanjing, Jiangsu, China) co-rotating twin-screw extruder (Ø = 22 mm, L/D 
ratio = 32–44). Prior to the blending step, the biopolymers used in this study were 
dried at 60 °C for at least 8 h in a Piovan DPA 10 dehumidifying dryer (Santa Maria 
di Sala, VE, Italy). The temperature profile of the extruder was set at 185 °C /175 °C /170 
°C /170 °C /170 °C /170 °C /175 °C /180 °C from hopper to nozzle, resulting in a melt tem-
perature at the die of 172–173 °C, and the rotation speed was 200 rpm. All the components 
were manually dry-mixed befo re extrusion. The extruded material was cooled in a

For subsequent cast extrusion, all of the PHA pellets were dried at 60C for at
least 4 hin a dehumidiﬁer (Piovan DPA 10). Each sample was cast extruded into a
400msheet using a single-screw extruder Rheomix 3000P ThermoHaake (ThermoFisher,
Karlsruhe, Germany) with a calendering system. The temperature proﬁle was set at
140C/165C/175C/170Cfrom hopper to ﬁshtail nozzle, the rotation speed was
100 rpm , and the temperature of the calendering chilling rolls was 40C. According to the
melt-temperature sensor during extrusion, the polymers were always at a temperature
range of 162–165C. In spite of its much lower melting point, neat PHBH was processed
under identical conditions as blends and PHBV for the sake of comparison. Table 1 sum-
marizes the compositions studied. Samples were named as V for PHBV and H for PHBH,

2.3. Characterization and Analysis
2.3.1. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
The 400- m sheet samples were fractured in both directions (MD and TD) under liquid
nitrogen to avoid plastic deformation of the polymer matrix. Prior to SEM analysis, the
fractured surfaces were coated by sputtering with a thin layer of platinum for 15 s (equiva-
lent to 2–3 nm) under argon atmosphere using a BalTec500 coater (Pfäfﬁkon, Switzerland).
SEM micrographs were obtained by using a high-resolution ﬁeld-emission JEOL 7001F
microscope (Peabody, MA, USA) at a voltage of 5 kV .
2.3.2. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)
DSC experiments were carried out on a Mettler-Toledo DSC 2 model (Columbus, OH,
USA), calibrated with Indium and sapphire standards before use. It was performed in an
inert nitrogen atmosphere with a ﬂow-rate of 50 mL/min, with samples of a typical weight
of 6 mg from the extruded ﬁlms in standard 40- L aluminum crucibles. PHBV and its
blends with PHBH were ﬁrst heated from 25C to 190C at 40C/min and maintained for
2 min to erase thermal history, cooled down to  20C at 10C/min, and subsequently
heated to 190C at 10C/min. PHBH followed the same cycle with the heating scan up to
165C. The melting temperature (T m) and enthalpy ( DHm), as well as the crystallization
temperature (T c) and enthalpy ( DHc), were calculated from the second heating and cooling
curves, respectively.
The melting enthalpies were normalized ( DHm.N) to a PHBV weight fraction in the
blend and compared with the theoretical melting enthalpy of 100% crystallized PHB,
reported to be 146 J/g [ 40]. This value is commonly considered a good approximation for
this particular PHBV , due to its low 3HV content [41].
2.3.3. Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering (WAXS)
WAXS experiments were carried out on the studied samples using a Bruker AXS D4
Endeavor diffractometer (Billerica, MA, USA). Radial scans of intensity versus scattering
angle (2 q) were recorded at room temperature in the range of 2–40(2q) (step size = 0.02
(2q), scanning rate = 4 s/step) with ﬁltered CuK aradiation ( l= 1.54 Å), an operating
voltage of 40 kV , and a ﬁlament current of 40 mA. The degree of crystallinity ( XC) was
calculated after the deconvolution of peaks from diffractograms using Equation (1) [42]:
XC(%) =AC
AC+Aa
100 (1)
where Acrepresents the total crystalline area of peaks, and Aais the area of amorphous halo .
2.3.4. Polarized Optical Microscopy (POM)
Sample solutions of 5% wt./vol were prepared by stirring magnetically powdered
PHBV , PHBH, and their blends in TFE at room temperature for 24 h, and sonicating for
1 h until the powder was completely dissolved. These solutions, previously ﬁltered by
a0.22 mPVDF ﬁlter, were cast onto a glass coverslip at 50C for 5 min and ﬁnally
dried for 24 h at 40C in a vacuum to eliminate residual solvent. The crystallizationPolymers 2022 ,14, 2527 6 of 24
process was observed using an Olympus BX51 polarized microscopy (Tokyo, Japan) with
a 10x times objective and equipped with a Linkam THMS600 hot stage (Salfords, United
Kingdom). Cast samples were heated up to 190C and maintained for 2 min to ensure
complete melting. Then, they were quenched at a cooling rate of 100C/min to 100C and
maintained for 15 min. This temperature cycle was repeated for a second time. Images
were taken with a digital camera attached to the objective and the crystalline-growth rate
(G) was calculated from the radial crystal growth and expressed in m/min.
2.3.5. Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA)
The DMA experiments were carried out with a Discovery DHR-1 oscillatory rheometer
(TA Instruments, New Castle, DE, USA) equipped with a clamp system for solid samples in
torsion mode. Film samples of a 12 mm 40 mm size were subjected to a heating program
from 20C to 185C (175C for PHBH), with a heating rate of 2C/min at a constant
frequency of 1 Hz. The maximum deformation ( g) was set to 0.1%.
2.3.6. Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)
The TGA measurements of the neat PHAs and their blends were carried out
using the extruded ﬁlms with a TG-STDA Mettler-Toledo analyzer, speciﬁcally the
TGA/STDA851e/LF/1600 model (Columbus, OH, USA). The samples with an initial
mass of, typically, about 15–17 mg were heated from 25C to 900C at a heating rate
of10C/min under 50 mL/min air ﬂow. The thermal stability of samples was evalu-
ated and the residue at 600C was determined. The onset decomposition temperature
(T5%, temperature at 5% weight loss) and the maximum decomposition rate temperature
(Tmax.d ) were determined from the weight loss curve and the maximum value of weight
loss derivative, respectively.
2.3.7. Mechanical Properties and Tear Resistance
The specimens for mechanical properties were cut in the machine direction (MD) and
tested at 0 days and 15 days. Tensile tests were carried out in accordance with the ASTM
D638 standard in a universal testing machine, equipped with a 500-N load cell (Shimadzu
AGS-X, Kyoto, Japan) at room temperature with a cross-head speed of 10 mm/min. Samples
were previously die-cut into type IV specimens (width 6 mm, length 55 mm) after extrusion.
Tear-resistance tests were carried out in accordance with the ISO 6383-1 standard into
trouser-shaped specimens (width 50 mm, length 100 mm) in the same universal testing
machine, at a speed of 200 mm/min. To prevent ageing in samples before testing, half of
the specimens for tensile and tear tests were stored at  40C before their characterization.
These were labeled as 0 days . In contrast, the rest were stored in a desiccator at room
temperature for 15 days , to allow physical ageing [ 43,44], and were subsequently used for
testing. A minimum of six specimens were measured for each test, time, and sample, and
the average results with standard deviation were assessed.
2.3.8. Thermoforming
A vacuum-assisted thermoforming study was carried out in an SB 53c pilot plant
(Illig, Helmut Roegele, Germany), equipped with an infrared-emitter heating device. The
mold used was a male cylinder tray with a diameter and height of 55 mm and 15 mm,
respectively. Sheets of 15–17 cm long and 400 m thick were cut and preserved until testing
as previously mentioned specimens (see Section 2.3.7).
The sheets were stamped with a square grid pattern (2 mm 2 mm) in order to track
deformation during their mold conformation. For all of the experiments, the infrared heater
was set to 600C, while the heating time was changed in order to indirectly control the
temperature of the PHA sheet. The thermoformability was evaluated in accordance with
the methodology proposed in a previous work of the group [19].
Brieﬂy, this methodology (see Figure 2) allows the quality of the thermoforming to be
classiﬁed in accordance with three parts of the thermoformed trays: the edge,corner , andPolymers 2022 ,14, 2527 7 of 24

windows for each composition.

2.3.8.  Thermoforming 
A vacuum-assisted thermoforming study was carried out in an SB 53c pilot plant 
(Illig, Helmut Roegele, Germany), equipped with an infrared-emitter heating device. 
The mold used was a male cylinder tray with a diameter and height of 55 mm and 15 mm, 
respectively. Sheets of 15–17 cm long and 400 µm thick were cut and preserved until test-
ing as previously mentioned specimens (see Section 2.3.7).  
The sheets were stamped wi th a square grid pattern (2 mm × 2 mm) in order to 
track deformation during their mold conforma tion. For all of the experiments, the in-
frared heater was set to 600 °C, while the heating time was changed in order to 
indirectly control the temperature of the PHA sheet. The thermoformability was eval-
uated in accordance with the methodology proposed in a previous work of the group 
[19]. 
Briefly, this methodology (see Figure 2) allows the quality of the thermoforming to 
be classified in accordance with three parts of the thermoformed trays: the edge, corner , 
and thickness distribution . Each one was classified as bad (red color), intermediate (blue 
color), or good (green color). This classification wa s used to establish the thermoforming 
time windows for each composition.

rameters lead to a general evaluation for ea ch time shown with the color of the frame. 
2.3.9. Melt-Flow Index (MFI) 
The MFI values were measured in a melt-flow indexer, model BMF-001.02 (Zwick 
Roell, Ulm, Germany), according to ISO 1133 standard. The tests were carried out at 180 
°C and 2.16 kg load. 
2.3.10. Marine Biodegradation 
Prior to starting the biodegradation tests,  the PHA pellets were powdered by cry-
ogenic milling under liquid ni trogen and subsequent sieving through a 250 µm mesh. 
Marine biodegradation was determined following the method described in the ASTM 
D6691 standard, for the first 60 days of testing. Airtight topaz 125-mL bottles were 
filled with 75 mL of autoclaved natural seawater from Calpe (Alicante, Spain), en-
riched with 0.5 g/L of NH 4Cl and 0.1 g/L of KH 2PO 4. Then, the solutions were mixed 
with 20 mg of powdered sample and inoculat ed with 250 µL of a concentrated marine-

2.3.9. Melt-Flow Index (MFI)
The MFI values were measured in a melt-ﬂow indexer, model BMF-001.02 (Zwick
Roell, Ulm, Germany), according to ISO 1133 standard. The tests were carried out at 180C
and 2.16 kg load.
2.3.10. Marine Biodegradation
Prior to starting the biodegradation tests, the PHA pellets were powdered by cryogenic
milling under liquid nitrogen and subsequent sieving through a 250 m mesh. Marine
biodegradation was determined following the method described in the ASTM D6691
standard, for the ﬁrst 60 days of testing. Airtight topaz 125-mL bottles were ﬁlled with
75 mL of autoclaved natural seawater from Calpe (Alicante, Spain), enriched with 0.5 g/L
of NH 4Cl and 0.1 g/L of KH 2PO4. Then, the solutions were mixed with 20 mg of powdered
sample and inoculated with 250 L of a concentrated marine-bacteria inoculum. All of the
samples studied, cellulose (reference) and a blank were prepared in triplicate. Bioreactors
were kept at 26C and a rotation of 50 rpm for 2 months in an orbital shaking incubator
model 2102 (Comecta, Barcelona, Spain). Aerobic conditions were guaranteed throughout
the entire experiment. Carbon dioxide evolved by microorganisms was registered by a
G110 IR analyser (Fonotest, Madrid, Spain). The percentage of aerobic biodegradation
(B%) was calculated by comparing the accumulated CO 2at a speciﬁc time with the total
theoretical carbon dioxide using Equation (2):

where CO 2(t) is the accumulated carbon dioxide of the sample at a speciﬁc time, CO 2
(b) is the average accumulated carbon dioxide of the blank at the same time, and ThCO 2
represents the total theoretical carbon dioxide calculated from the total organic carbon and
the mass of each sample.Polymers 2022 ,14, 2527 8 of 24
3. Results
3.1. Morphology
The SEM analysis was carried out on the cross-section of ﬁlms in order to analyze
the morphology and phase distribution of the PHA blends. Micrographs were taken in
both MD and TD to assess the ﬁlm orientation during cast extrusion. SEM micrographs
showed a smooth uniform surface at any magniﬁcation (from 500x to 5000x), displaying the
presence of nucleating agents from the commercial PHBV and PHBH samples. Regarding
the blending compositions, no remarkable differences were observed with the addition of
PHBH to the PHBV matrix.
As an example, representative SEM images of the V/H 60:40 blend are shown in
Figure 3. Even this blend is based on the highest content of PHBH, as it exhibited a
monophasic structure regardless the extrusion direction. This suggests good miscibility of
the biopolyesters throughout all composition ratios studied.

3.2. Crystallization Studies
3.2.1. Crystallization Kinetics
A polarized optical microscope equipped with a hot-melt stage was used to observe
the effect of the presence of the low-crystalline PHBH on the spherulite morphology and
the crystallization rates of PHBV .
Crystallization kinetics in copolymers are complex and involve a great variety of
phenomena, such as the production of primary nuclei, the interdiffusion of crystallizable
and non-crystallizable chains, or the presence of nucleating agents [ 45]. In order to remove
any possible impurity and the nucleating agents, samples were ﬁltered before casting upon
the microscope coverslip. An initial heating step at 190C for 2 min was applied to all ofPolymers 2022 ,14, 2527 9 of 24
the cast samples to ensure the full melting of the materials. Laycock et al. [ 46] determined
this time and temperature as the minimum necessary to avoid the presence of unmelted
microcrystals of PHA, while limiting thermal degradation by the melt time. Molten samples
were quenched to 100C to promote the crystallization of the biopolyesters. After 15 min
of isothermal crystallization at 100C, the crystalline growth rate, G, was calculated and its
values are given in Figure 4.

and their blends. Crystals isothermally formed at 100  °C at two different times. Circular images at 
10x, squared images at 10x plus 4x digital magnifications. 
A decrease in the size of the spherulites  for equivalent crystallization times was 
observed for the blends as the PHBH conten t increased. As a consequence, the growth 
rate decayed from 1 µm/min for the neat PHBV to 0.5 µm/min, 0.4 µm/min, and 0.3 
µm/min for the samples with 20% wt., 30 % wt., and 40% wt. of PHBH, respectively. 
This led to a drop of 50% in the crystalli zation speed, with the addition of 20% wt. of 
PHBH to the blend. Nonetheless, the subseq uent additions of 10% wt. of PHBH until 
a 60:40 ratio (PHBV/PHBH) only supposed a reduction of 0.1 µm/min each. As other 
authors have mentioned, the non-crystalliz ing or slow-crystallizing component may 
be excluded from the growing spherulites, thus being found in excess at the spheru-
litic boundaries [46]. As a result of the exclusion of voluminous 3HH units from the 
crystalline phase, the diffusion of 3HB and 3HV units to crystals is hindered by the 
progressive addition of bulky, non-crys tallizable PHBH mole cules to the blends. 
These results are consistent with the results obtained by Chang et al. [47] in binary 
blends of PHBV (semi-crystalline) and PVAc (amorphous).

A decrease in the size of the spherulites for equivalent crystallization times was
observed for the blends as the PHBH content increased. As a consequence, the growth rate

a drop of 50% in the crystallization speed, with the addition of 20% wt. of PHBH to the
blend. Nonetheless, the subsequent additions of 10% wt. of PHBH until a 60:40 ratio
(PHBV/PHBH) only supposed a reduction of 0.1 m/min each. As other authors have
mentioned, the non-crystallizing or slow-crystallizing component may be excluded from

As a result of the exclusion of voluminous 3HH units from the crystalline phase, the
diffusion of 3HB and 3HV units to crystals is hindered by the progressive addition of
bulky, non-crystallizable PHBH molecules to the blends. These results are consistent with
the results obtained by Chang et al. [ 47] in binary blends of PHBV (semi-crystalline) and
PVAc (amorphous).
Regarding the morphology, the spherulites showed the typical ring-banded patterns
and the Maltese-cross of random copolymers (Figure 4). The Maltese-cross pattern, pre-
sented in all of the samples studied, originates from a parallel or perpendicular crystal axis
with respect to the polarization direction [ 48]. The banded structures have been associ-
ated to the presence of periodically twisted lamellar crystals coming from the release of
chain-conformation stresses [49].
In this regard, Hsieh et al. [ 47,50] found that, in PHBV/PVAc blends, the regularity
of PHBV rings becomes better and the band spacing decreases signiﬁcantly with the
increasing content of the amorphous polymer. The authors proposed that the additional
excess surface stresses, induced by the interaction between the amorphous phase and the
lamellar crystals, increased the twisting of lamellae. Contrary to what was postulated, and
with the exception of unbanded neat PHBV , all PHBV/PHBH blends exhibited ring-banded
spherulites, which slightly but clearly increased band spacing when higher PHBH (mainly
amorphous) contents were used.
3.2.2. Thermal and Crystallization Behavior
DSC experiments were carried out on the neat PHAs and their blends in order to study
the melting and crystallization process. The values of DHm,DHc, Tm, Tc, andDHm.Nare
summarized in Table 2. The melting points of V100 and H100 were consistent with the
values reported in the literature: 170–175C for PHBV [ 51] and 114–120C for PHBH [ 52].
PHBV and PHBH exhibited considerable differences in terms of their characteristic melting
and crystallization temperatures, that is, 54C and 38C for T mand T c, respectively,
with both being higher for PHBV . In a general manner, PHBV/PHBH blends exhibited an
intermediate thermal behavior to both neat components but closer to that of PHBV .

Figure 5 plots the representative thermograms of the cooling and second heating steps
for all of the materials studied. Regarding crystallization behavior, as observed from the
cooling curve (Figure 5A), PHBV and its blends showed a single peak of crystallization,
while PHBH presented a wider and less intense peak with a little shoulder at lower
temperatures. This behavior indicates that two populations of crystals were generated
during cooling or could result from a melt–recrystallization phenomenon [ 53,54]. However,
this last phenomenon is more representative of MCL-PHAs with a side-chain length that
is greater than C4 [ 55]. Additionally, the T cvalues of blends were shifted towards lower
temperatures as the PHBH content increased. This may indicate that the presence of
PHBH hinders the crystallization process of PHBV crystals, which is in accordance with
POM observations.Polymers 2022 ,14, 2527 11 of 24

(PHBV), poly(3-hydroxybutyrate- co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) (PHBH), and their blends with PHBH 
crystallization curve detailed. 
As pointed out by Noda et al. [56], the incorporation of different MCL-PHAs into 
PHB decreased its melting point due to the redu ction in packing efficiency in the crys-
tals. Regarding the melting behavior, as eval uated from the second-heating curve (Fig-
ure 5B), the PHBV and low-PHBH- content blends presented a single melting peak. 
Similar to the crystallization curves, the me lting peak temperature decreased with the 
PHBH addition . For the 40% wt. PHBH blend, the melting event occurred in two melting 
peaks. Multiple melting peaks are generally ascribed to melting, recrystallization, and re-
melting phenomena due to the annealing undergone by the material during heating [57]. 
In this case, the first peak, seen at 166 °C, would be the melting temperature correspond-
ing to the crystals generated du ring cooling, which agrees with the trend observed in the 
other blends [53]. The progressive decrease in the melting temperature of PHBV with the addition of PHBH could be explained by a reduction in the size of the crystalline domains, 
which was potentially induced by the steric hindrance imposed by PHBH onto the crys-
tallization of the PHBV chains [52]. 
As can be observed in the normalized enthalpies, also shown in Table 2, no 
significant  
differences were seen with respect to the neat PHBV melting enthalpy or between the 
blends. This may indicate that only PHBV crys tallized, while PHBH remained in the 
amorphous fraction. Therefore, although the crystalline PHBV domains were smaller in 
the blends than in the neat material (as observed by  both DSC and POM), it is confirmed 
that the degree of crystallization of PHBV in the blends remained nearly the same as 
in the pristine PHBV. Similarly, Yoshie et al. [58] found that PHBP chains could not 
participate in the PHB-type lattice, so on ly the homogeneous sequences of 3HB units 
longer than the lamellas could participate in the lamellas induced by PHBV. Thus, 
PHBP hardly co-crystallized with PHBV in the PHBV/PHBP blends. Moreover, accord-
ing to the T m patterns described by Yoshi et al. [59] , melting points as a function of the 
PHBH fraction in the blend we re plotted in Figure 6 to discern phase structures in the 
blends.

As pointed out by Noda et al. [ 56], the incorporation of different MCL-PHAs into
PHB decreased its melting point due to the reduction in packing efﬁciency in the crystals.
Regarding the melting behavior, as evaluated from the second-heating curve (Figure 5B),
the PHBV and low-PHBH-content blends presented a single melting peak. Similar to the
crystallization curves, the melting peak temperature decreased with the PHBH addition.
For the 40% wt. PHBH blend, the melting event occurred in two melting peaks. Multiple
melting peaks are generally ascribed to melting, recrystallization, and remelting phenom-
ena due to the annealing undergone by the material during heating [ 57]. In this case, the
ﬁrst peak, seen at 166C, would be the melting temperature corresponding to the crystals
generated during cooling, which agrees with the trend observed in the other blends [ 53].
The progressive decrease in the melting temperature of PHBV with the addition of PHBH
could be explained by a reduction in the size of the crystalline domains, which was po-
tentially induced by the steric hindrance imposed by PHBH onto the crystallization of the
PHBV chains [52].

crystallized with PHBV in the PHBV/PHBP blends. Moreover, according to the T mpatterns
described by Yoshi et al. [ 59], melting points as a function of the PHBH fraction in the blend
were plotted in Figure 6 to discern phase structures in the blends.Polymers 2022 ,14, 2527 12 of 24

Figure 6. Melting temperature values of  the poly(3-hydroxybutyrate- co-3-valerate) (PHBV)/poly(3-
hydroxybutyrate- co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) (PHBH) blends depending on the PHBH fraction. 
The melting point of neat PHBH  did not follow a linear correlation with the T m of 
PHBV and their blends. Although it would be  convenient to complete the curve with 
PHBH fractions > 50% wt., it is presumable that a straight line would deviate into a convex 
curve. These data suggest the miscibility of  the amorphous phase and partial segregation 
of the crystalline phase, during melting with PHBV-rich crystals [60,61]. 
3.2.3. Crystal Structure 
Wide-angle X-ray scattering was carried ou t in order to study the crystalline-struc-
ture changes with the addition of PHBH to the PHBV matrix. The diffractograms and 
crystalline degree of the biopolymers and their blends are shown in Figure 7. 
Except for PHBH, the most intense peak at 27° (2 θ) belongs to boron nitride, incor-
porated as a nucleating agent in these co mmercial polymers. PHBV yielded two main 
peaks at 13.5 and 17° (2 θ), which are associated with the (020) and (110) reflections of the 
orthorhombic lattice of PHBV, respectively [62]. PHBH crystallized in a PHB orthorhom-
bic lattice [63] and showed the same two peaks associated with the same planes, but 
the second one was much less intense. In the case of PHBH, the rest of its characteristic 
peaks were also almost hidden by the amorphous halo. Thus, for all the blend compo-
sitions, this halo centered at 18° (2 θ) and associated with the amorphous fraction of 
the material, which increased as the PH BH fraction in the blend increased.  
No noticeable differences in the peak po sitions were detected for any blend. It 
suggests that the basic crystal structure of PHBV (the crystal lattice) remained unaltered. 
However, there were some relative intensity changes  when PHBH was incorporated 
into PHBV. Hence, as the PHBH content incr eased, the intensity of the (020) peaks 
decreased while the (110) and (111)* peaks in creased. In pristine PHBH, these last two 
peaks are difficult to appreciate. Moreover, plane (021) was more intense than (111)* 
in H100. In particular, (111)*  represents the fusion of planes  (111) and (101) in just one 
wider peak, due to the processing temperature that changes the crystalline domains of 
3HB and 3HV, as reported by Bossu et al. [64] for PHBV with 3 % mol. 3HV and 18 % 
mol. 3HV. Intensity-ratio variation of main peaks (020) and (110) can be attributed to 
the different size or the different reorganization rates of the planes during the lamellar-
thickening process through th e interlamellar slip [65].  
According to the literature , PHBV and PHBH both crystallized in the PHB lattice 
[63,66], but in different ma nners. PHBV is well-known to have an isomorphous co-
crystallization behavior, depending on th e major component of the copolymer. 
Hence, for PHBV with 3HV contents below 30 % mol., 3HV units are included in the 
Figure 6. Melting temperature values of the poly(3-hydroxybutyrate- co-3-valerate) (PHBV)/poly(3-

Wide-angle X-ray scattering was carried out in order to study the crystalline-structure
changes with the addition of PHBH to the PHBV matrix. The diffractograms and crystalline
degree of the biopolymers and their blends are shown in Figure 7.
Except for PHBH, the most intense peak at 27(2q) belongs to boron nitride, incor-
porated as a nucleating agent in these commercial polymers. PHBV yielded two main
peaks at 13.5 and 17(2q), which are associated with the (020) and (110) reﬂections of the
orthorhombic lattice of PHBV , respectively [ 62]. PHBH crystallized in a PHB orthorhombic
lattice [ 63] and showed the same two peaks associated with the same planes, but the second
one was much less intense. In the case of PHBH, the rest of its characteristic peaks were
also almost hidden by the amorphous halo. Thus, for all the blend compositions, this halo
centered at 18(2q) and associated with the amorphous fraction of the material, which
increased as the PHBH fraction in the blend increased.
No noticeable differences in the peak positions were detected for any blend. It suggests
that the basic crystal structure of PHBV (the crystal lattice) remained unaltered. However,
there were some relative intensity changes when PHBH was incorporated into PHBV .
Hence, as the PHBH content increased, the intensity of the (020) peaks decreased while
the (110) and (111)* peaks increased. In pristine PHBH, these last two peaks are difﬁcult
to appreciate. Moreover, plane (021) was more intense than (111)* in H100. In particular,
(111)* represents the fusion of planes (111) and (101) in just one wider peak, due to the
processing temperature that changes the crystalline domains of 3HB and 3HV , as reported
by Bossu et al. [ 64] for PHBV with 3 % mol. 3HV and 18 % mol. 3HV . Intensity-ratio
variation of main peaks (020) and (110) can be attributed to the different size or the different
reorganization rates of the planes during the lamellar-thickening process through the

 PHB lattice. On the other hand, other PHB copolymers with a higher number of carbons 
in the monomeric unit do not show isomorphou s behavior [58]. This is the case of PHBH, 
where bulky 3HH units are excluded from the crystal lattice, while the 3HV monomer 
is incorporated into the PHB crystal in loos er structures [67], thus rendering a lower 
degree of crystallization, 51.2%.  
Compared to PHBV , a difference of approximately 26% in the degree of crystal-
linity was observed between the neat biopolym ers. The theoretical degree of the crys-
tallinity of blends based on X C and the weight fraction of each PHA only differed by 
1.5%, 3%, and 4% (V/H 80:20, 70:30, and 60:40, respectively) with their experimental X C. 
Thus, in accordance with the DSC results, PHBH hinder s crystal formation and crys-
talline domains as well as reduces the kinetics of PHBV, but it does not avoid the final 
degree of crystallinity in the blends.

According to the literature, PHBV and PHBH both crystallized in the PHB lattice [63,66] ,
but in different manners. PHBV is well-known to have an isomorphous co-crystallization
behavior, depending on the major component of the copolymer. Hence, for PHBV with
3HV contents below 30 % mol., 3HV units are included in the PHB lattice. On the other
hand, other PHB copolymers with a higher number of carbons in the monomeric unit do
not show isomorphous behavior [ 58]. This is the case of PHBH, where bulky 3HH units are
excluded from the crystal lattice, while the 3HV monomer is incorporated into the PHB
crystal in looser structures [67], thus rendering a lower degree of crystallization, 51.2%.
Compared to PHBV , a difference of approximately 26% in the degree of crystallinity

(V/H 80:20, 70:30, and 60:40, respectively) with their experimental X C. Thus, in accordance
with the DSC results, PHBH hinders crystal formation and crystalline domains as well
as reduces the kinetics of PHBV , but it does not avoid the ﬁnal degree of crystallinity in
the blends.Polymers 2022 ,14, 2527 14 of 24

The viscoelastic behavior of the PHA blends was studied by means of DMA. Figure 8
displays the storage modulus and tan dcurves from  20C to 100C. All blends exhibited
a single peak in the tan dcurve, this being a relaxation attributed to the glass transition of
the material [ 68]. The presence of a single peak in the blends conﬁrms the full miscibility of
the PHAs in the amorphous fraction, in agreement with previous observations. In addition,
the T gvalues shifted to lower temperatures as the PHBH content increased [23].

PHBH showed a more intense relaxation at 4.5 °C than neat PHBV with a T g at 13.7 
°C, this being the result of a major presence of the amorphous fraction in PHBH when 
compared with the highly crysta lline PHBV [68]. The G’ and tan δ curves of the blends 
showed an intermediate beha vior between the neat PHAs, both in terms of the drop 
in the storage modulus and intensities of the relaxation, respec tively, as the PHBH 
content increased. Despite the variation in the viscoelastic behavior of PHBV when 
PHBH is incorporated, the ch anges were not proportional to the blend composition. 
For instance, the addition of 40% wt. of PH BH only generated a reduction of 3 °C in 
the tan δ peak.  
The G’ modulus, which is a measure of el astic behavior, is associated with stiff-
ness and is conceptually related to Young’s modu lus [69]. In this regard, mechanical per-
formance in terms of stiffness dependence with temperature can be inferred. The value 
of G’ was mostly affected by  the presence of PHBH, but not directly proportional to 
the MCL-PHA present in the blend.  
3.4. Thermal Stability 
The thermal stability  of PHBV, PHBH, and their blends was assessed by TGA. The 
corresponding TGA and derivative thermogravimet ric (DTG) curves are shown in 
Figure 9. The T 5% and T max.d values are displayed in Table 2. The TGA curves showed 
that the thermal degradation of PHBV and PHBH occurs in a single step  process. 
According to the literature [70], a random chain scission by means of a cis-elimination 
mechanism, also called the McLafferty rearrang ement, is considered as the general path-
way of thermal degradation for PHB and PHBV.

PHBH showed a more intense relaxation at 4.5C than neat PHBV with a T gat13.7C,
this being the result of a major presence of the amorphous fraction in PHBH when compared
with the highly crystalline PHBV [ 68]. The G’ and tan dcurves of the blends showed an
intermediate behavior between the neat PHAs, both in terms of the drop in the storage
modulus and intensities of the relaxation, respectively, as the PHBH content increased.
Despite the variation in the viscoelastic behavior of PHBV when PHBH is incorporated,
the changes were not proportional to the blend composition. For instance, the addition of
40% wt. of PHBH only generated a reduction of 3C in the tan dpeak.
The G’ modulus, which is a measure of elastic behavior, is associated with stiffness and
is conceptually related to Young’s modulus [ 69]. In this regard, mechanical performance
in terms of stiffness dependence with temperature can be inferred. The value of G’ was
mostly affected by the presence of PHBH, but not directly proportional to the MCL-PHA
present in the blend.
3.4. Thermal Stability
The thermal stability of PHBV , PHBH, and their blends was assessed by TGA. The
corresponding TGA and derivative thermogravimetric (DTG) curves are shown in Figure 9.
The T 5%and T max.d values are displayed in Table 2. The TGA curves showed that the
thermal degradation of PHBV and PHBH occurs in a single step process. According to
the literature [70], a random chain scission by means of a cis-elimination mechanism, alsoPolymers 2022 ,14, 2527 15 of 24
called the McLafferty rearrangement, is considered as the general pathway of thermal
degradation for PHB and PHBV .

 PHBH, which differs from PHBV in the le ngth of the side chains, followed the 
same one-step process with almost the equivalent maximum decomposition temper-
ature, at around 293 °C. This agrees with Le e et al. [71] in their report on the thermal-
degradation mechanism for PHO, another MCL-PHA similar to PHBH. The blends 
exhibited a very slight decrease in T 5% and T max.d, which may suggest a certain decrease 
in molecular weight during processing. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that the 
blends were subjected to an additional thermal treatment (melt blending) compared to 
the neat PHAs that were used as received fo r cast extrusion. Particularly, as the PHBH 
content increased, the thermal stability of the blend system incr eased. One can con-
sider that the side chains  of MCL-PHAs sterically hindered the formation of the six-
membered transition structure, resulting in a higher thermal degradation temperature [51]. 
However, in general, the TGA pa rameters were similar to those of the neat copolymers, 
3 °C being the maximum difference between th em. Therefore, it can be concluded that 
the blends are thermally as st able as the neat components.

PHBH, which differs from PHBV in the length of the side chains, followed the same
one-step process with almost the equivalent maximum decomposition temperature, at
around 293C. This agrees with Lee et al. [ 71] in their report on the thermal-degradation

the thermal stability of the blend system increased. One can consider that the side chains
of MCL-PHAs sterically hindered the formation of the six-membered transition structure,
resulting in a higher thermal degradation temperature [ 51]. However, in general, the
TGA parameters were similar to those of the neat copolymers, 3C being the maximum
difference between them. Therefore, it can be concluded that the blends are thermally as
stable as the neat components.
3.5. Mechanical Behaviour
The mechanical behavior of PHBV , PHBH, and their blends was studied by tensile
test, up to failure and tear resistance. The tensile modulus of the elasticity  , yield strength
(sy), and percent of elongation at break ( #b) of the different compositions and times (0 days
and 15 days) in MD are shown in Figure 10. Representative strain–stress curves of neat
polymers and blends at 0 days and 15 days are also displayed.Polymers 2022 ,14, 2527 16 of 24

 character, this brittleness being dependent on the developed crystallinity [18,72]. Further-
more, PHAs suffer a further progressive embrittlem ent over time, which is attributed 
to a combination of two phenomena: a seco ndary crystallization process and physical 
ageing of the amorphous phase when T > T g [16].  
On the other hand, PHBH presented a typical strain–stress curve of a ductile pol-
ymer, as derived from its low crystallinity.  Nevertheless, the change undergone by 
the tensile properties over time follows a similar trend to that of PHBV, showing an 
increase in the modulus of elasticity and yi eld strength, with a great reduction in elon-
gation at break. The addition of PHBH to PH BV in the blends resulted in an intermedi-
ate behavior in terms of E and σy. However, εb was barely affected by the addition of 
PHBH. These trends can be explained by assumi ng that the crystalline fraction of the SCL-
PHA is ruling the mechanical properties of the blends (similar to neat PHBV).

Hence, the modulus of elasticity decrea sed when increasing the PHBH content 
in the blends. This trend was clearer after 15 days , when the crystallinity was almost fully 
developed. As mentioned in Section 3.2, although  a small addition of PHBH greatly 
changed the crystallization rate, the final degree of crystallinity of PHBV did not change 
significantly. Yield strength in PHBV and its blends were not affected as much as it 
was with neat PHBH. As all of these samples  showed brittle behavior, so this stress may 
be related to a toughness value rather than with an elastic-to-plastic transition.  
Ductility seemed to be the parameter most sensitive to ageing. For all the blends 
studied, the intrinsic brittleness of the cr ystalline fraction of PHBV clearly dominated 
the behavior of any composition. Even in the blend containing 40% wt. of PHBH, the con-
tribution of PHBH slightly increased the εb at 0 days, from 2.8% for the neat PHBV to 
4.5%. The decrease in εb after 15 days was remarkable fo r all the materials studied,

Crystallization behavior plays a major role in the mechanical properties of PHAs.
Crystallinity has a direct effect on tensile modulus and tensile strength [ 72]. Thus, highly
crystalline PHAs, such as PHBV with low 3HV content, exhibit an intrinsic fragile character,
this brittleness being dependent on the developed crystallinity [ 18,72]. Furthermore, PHAs
suffer a further progressive embrittlement over time, which is attributed to a combination of
two phenomena: a secondary crystallization process and physical ageing of the amorphous
phase when T > T g[16].
On the other hand, PHBH presented a typical strain–stress curve of a ductile polymer,
as derived from its low crystallinity. Nevertheless, the change undergone by the tensile
properties over time follows a similar trend to that of PHBV , showing an increase in the
modulus of elasticity and yield strength, with a great reduction in elongation at break. The
addition of PHBH to PHBV in the blends resulted in an intermediate behavior in terms of
E and sy. However, #bwas barely affected by the addition of PHBH. These trends can be
explained by assuming that the crystalline fraction of the SCL-PHA is ruling the mechanical
properties of the blends (similar to neat PHBV).
Hence, the modulus of elasticity decreased when increasing the PHBH content in
the blends. This trend was clearer after 15 days, when the crystallinity was almost fully
developed. As mentioned in Section 3.2, although a small addition of PHBH greatly
changed the crystallization rate, the ﬁnal degree of crystallinity of PHBV did not change
signiﬁcantly. Yield strength in PHBV and its blends were not affected as much as it was
with neat PHBH. As all of these samples showed brittle behavior, so this stress may be
related to a toughness value rather than with an elastic-to-plastic transition.Polymers 2022 ,14, 2527 17 of 24
Ductility seemed to be the parameter most sensitive to ageing. For all the blends
studied, the intrinsic brittleness of the crystalline fraction of PHBV clearly dominated
the behavior of any composition. Even in the blend containing 40% wt. of PHBH, the
contribution of PHBH slightly increased the #bat 0 days, from 2.8% for the neat PHBV
to 4.5%. The decrease in #bafter 15 days was remarkable for all the materials studied,
dropping to 1%–1.5% for PHBV and the blends, and to 12.7% for neat PHBH. Secondary
crystallization and the physical ageing of the amorphous fraction trapped between lamellae
are considered to constrict the structure of and around the spherulites [ 16]. The boundaries
and internal ﬁssures of spherulites could act as stress concentrators that promote fracture.
Thus, the slight effect of the ductile biopolymer in terms of the toughening capacity, despite
the increased mobility of the amorphous fraction, can be attributed to the fact that the
fracture of PHBV is dominated by the crystal fraction, as the initial steps of the fracture
take place in the internal ﬂaws between the lamellae that easily become critical within the
same spherulite [73].
Figure 10E summarizes the results of the average tear resistance, obtained by means
of the tearing test of the trouser method. In agreement with the tensile-test results, the tear
resistance follows the same tendency as ductility. PHBV presented a low tear resistance,
with values of less than 10 N/mm for 0 days, decreasing to 6 N/mm after 15 days. On
the other hand, PHBH showed a high tear-resistance value, around 39 N/mm, which
underwent a slight decrease (below 15%) with the ageing time. With respect to the blends,
all of the compositions studied presented values from 10 N/mm to 12 N/mm, regardless
of the ageing time. These results are in the range of the neat PHBV , thus conﬁrming the low
toughness of the blends. However, the incorporation of PHBH seems to avoid the effect of
ageing. Moreover, for each studied formulation and from a practical point of view, it can be
considered that ageing barely impacts tear resistance.
3.6. Thermoforming Studies
Thermoforming is a low-cost processing technology widely used in the plastics indus-
try to transform polymer sheets into a great variety of shapes, mainly trays and blisters.
PHBV is known for having a poor thermoformability due to a high crystallinity and low
melt strength, hence, resulting in a very narrow processing window. Their adequate soften-
ing temperature is close to the melting point of the polymers, thus reducing the operating
temperature range [ 19]. In fact, for the neat PHBV , none of the studied operational con-
ditions (from 11 s to 40 s of heating time) led to a good thermoformed tray, as shown in
Figure 11. On the one hand, at a low heating time (i.e., lower temperatures) the sheet was
not fully plasticized. Therefore, the stiffness of the polymer did not allow the sheet to yield
in order to replicate the shape of the mold accurately. On the other hand, at a high heating
time (i.e., high temperatures), the sheet underwent a sagging effect [ 74] (related to a sudden
loss in the mechanical stability of polymer) leading to an uneven distribution of thicknesses
that was seen at heating times above 23 s.
Conversely, neat PHBH presented a good thermoformability throughout the heating
range studied. This can be ascribed to a higher melt elasticity [ 75], associated with a lower
crystallinity and a mechanical behavior governed by the predominant amorphous fraction.
Regarding the blends, for all the compositions studied, a good thermoformability with an
extended processing window was detected, as can be observed in the images. Furthermore,
the amount of PHBH in the blend composition did not appear to have a relevant effect on
thermoformability, the results being similar for all of the blends studied: the processing
window has been widened from 20 s to 27 s ( green color frame). The addition of PHBH
resulted in all cases in an increase in the melt elasticity, thus rendering an improved mold
reproduction together with a decrease in the sagging effect.Polymers 2022 ,14, 2527 18 of 24

3.7. Marine Biodegradability
Biodegradation is a complex process that depends on many different factors, such as
the chemical composition, structure, or crystallinity of the materials as well as the temper-
ature and microbiome (fungi, yeast, bacteria) of the tested environment [ 76]. Following
ASTM D 6691, the natural seawater-inoculum option, biodegradation of PHBV , PHBH, and
their blends were assessed in a simulated marine environment during the ﬁrst two months
of testing. The evolution of biodegradation (B%) over time is shown in Figure 12.

 3.7. Marine Biodegradability 
Biodegradation is a complex process that depends on many different factors, such 
as the chemical composition, structure, or crystallinity of the materials as well as the 
temperature and microbiome (fungi, yeast, bacteria) of the tested environment [76]. 
Following ASTM D 6691, the natural seawater-inoculum option, biodegradation of 
PHBV, PHBH, and their blends were assessed in a simulated marine environment  dur-
ing the first two months of testing. The evol ution of biodegradation (B%) over time is 
shown in Figure 12.  
All compositions clearly exceed the cellulose biodegradation during all the tests. This 
can be attributed to the low cellulolytic capability of the inoculum, which is also respon-
sible for the initial lag of almost 30 days  for the onset of cell ulose biodegradation.

In this context, one should take into account that PHAs are known to be fully 
biodegradable in all kinds of environmen ts, including marine [77]. However, the 
higher amorphous fraction of PHBH result ed in a higher biodegradation rate com-
pared to the more crystalline PHBV, with a curve that was kept approximately 3% 
lower until day 50. The amorphous fraction is preferre d by microorganisms to be de-
graded first in the initial stages because the mobility of the chains facilitates the accessi-
bility of their enzymes [78]. As can be seen in Figure 12B, the biodegradation rate of 
the blends was slightly different, but all cu rves were located between the neat biopol-
ymers according to the vari ation of crystallinity. Despite the different rate of biodegra-
dation, the final degree of biod egradation reached by all of the tested samples stabilized 
around 32% after 60 days, as can be seen in Figure 12A. These results agree with the 30% 
of biodegradation reported by Meereboer et al. [79] for PHBV by day 60, following the 
standard ASTM D 7991 . 
4. Conclusions 
Blends of PHBV  with a content of increasing PHBH, of up to 40% wt., have been 
obtained by melt-mixing and subsequent cast  extrusion. The influence of the addition 
of the MCL-PHA to PHBV on the morpholo gy, crystallinity, thermal and mechanical 
properties, thermoformability, and biodegrada bility has been studied. In spite of all 
compositions exhibiting full miscibility (single T g peak), the crystallinity of the result-

All compositions clearly exceed the cellulose biodegradation during all the tests. This
can be attributed to the low cellulolytic capability of the inoculum, which is also responsible
for the initial lag of almost 30 days for the onset of cellulose biodegradation.
In this context, one should take into account that PHAs are known to be fully
biodegradable in all kinds of environments, including marine [ 77]. However, the higher
amorphous fraction of PHBH resulted in a higher biodegradation rate compared to the
more crystalline PHBV , with a curve that was kept approximately 3% lower until day 50.
The amorphous fraction is preferred by microorganisms to be degraded ﬁrst in the initial
stages because the mobility of the chains facilitates the accessibility of their enzymes [ 78].
As can be seen in Figure 12B, the biodegradation rate of the blends was slightly different,
but all curves were located between the neat biopolymers according to the variation of
crystallinity. Despite the different rate of biodegradation, the ﬁnal degree of biodegradation
reached by all of the tested samples stabilized around 32% after 60 days, as can be seen in
Figure 12A. These results agree with the 30% of biodegradation reported by Meereboer
et al. [79] for PHBV by day 60, following the standard ASTM D 7991.Polymers 2022 ,14, 2527 20 of 24
4. Conclusions
Blends of PHBV with a content of increasing PHBH, of up to 40% wt., have been
obtained by melt-mixing and subsequent cast extrusion. The inﬂuence of the addition of the
MCL-PHA to PHBV on the morphology, crystallinity, thermal and mechanical properties,
thermoformability, and biodegradability has been studied. In spite of all compositions
exhibiting full miscibility (single T gpeak), the crystallinity of the resulting blends was
limited to the PHBV fraction. Thus, although bulky 3HH units hindered the spherulite
growth rate of PHBV from 1.0 m/min to 0.3 m/min, the eventual degree of crystallinity
achieved by PHBV remained unaltered. The experimental degree of crystallization of
blends obtained by WAXS (74%, 73%, and 63% for 20% wt., 30% wt., and 40% wt. of
PHBH) only differed by 1.5%–4.0% compared to the theoretical degree of crystallization
calculated, according to the weight fraction of the blend components. The crystalline phase
still governed the mechanical performance of the blends, thus revealing a poor toughening
effect of PHBH for all of the studied range. Hence, the mechanical parameters of PHBV
were slightly affected in the blends. However, the incorporation of PHBH successfully
resulted in an increase in the melt elasticity, regardless of the amount added, thus leading to
an improved thermoformability, which considerably broadened the processing window by
7 s from the non-optimal processing window of PHBV . Biodegradation studies in simulated
marine environment conﬁrmed that, after two months, all of the studied compositions
reached the same degree of biodegradation (around 32%). Therefore, this study has proven
that the direct blending of miscible MCL-PHA nearly improves the mechanical performance
of low-3HV content PHBV since it is still governed by the intrinsically brittle crystalline
nature of the SCL-PHA. However, it does represent an effective approach to enhancing its
processability by means of thermoforming.
