Abstract
Dietary and nondietary accumulation of waterborne zinc (Zn) by shell of abalone Haliotis diversicolor supertexta was studied to
determine if abalone shell can accumulate and eliminate Zn biokinetically. Shell of H. diversicolor supertexta rapidly accumulated
Zn at microgram per gram concentrations during a 7-d uptake period for dietary and nondietary exposure to 1 lgm l/C01Zn seawater.
Depuration half-lives were 7.22 and 15.40 d for dietary and nondietary exposure, respectively. The uptake rate constants were 5.12
and 4.84 ml g/C01d/C01, respectively, for dietary and nondietary exposure. The depuration rate constants were 0.048 and 0.10 d/C01,
respectively for dietary and nondietary exposure. Results from this study showed that the shell of H. diversicolor supertexta
accumulated Zn and that it reﬂected the composition of the seawater in which the abalone lived. This suggested that the shell of
H. diversicolor supertexta can be used as a bioindicator or can act as a receptor to biokinetically eliminate heavy metals from aquatic
food webs.

1. Introduction
The accumulations of heavy metal in some marine
organisms, such as mollusks and algae, have been sug-
gested as indicators of heavy metal contamination in
aquatic ecosystem (Zatta et al., 1992; Karez et al., 1994;Walsh et al., 1995; Han et al., 1997). Many mollusks andalgae have wide distributions, extensive populations,sedentary nature and the ability to accumulate conta-minants. Monitoring those bioaccumulators for heavymetals is useful as an ideal contamination index inaquatic ecosystems (Burdin and Bird, 1994; Walsh et al.,
1994; Uno et al., 1997).
Abalone are common gastropod mollusks that in-
habit the coastal reefs in tropical and subtropical areas(Hahn, 1989). The herbivorous gastropod, Haliotis
diversicolor supertexta , is the most abundant abalone
species in Taiwan. The aquaculture of H. diversicolorsupertexta is one of the important aquatic products in
Taiwan (Chen, 1984, 1989). H. diversicolor supertexta
prefers red algae, Gracilaria spp., which yield the best
growth of the abalone (Chen, 1989; Singhagraiwan and
Doi, 1993). Because of economic considerations, the
seaweed Gracilaria tenuistipitata var. liuihas been
selected to be the major forage for culturing H. diver-
sicolor supertexta .
The accumulation of heavy metals in mollusks has
been mainly studied from the content of soft tissues(Lautie et al., 1988). Although Bertine and Goldberg(1972) and Walsh et al. (1995) noted that heavy metals
could be accumulated in soft tissue and calcareous
shells of mollusks, yet the biokinetic characteristics of theshell is poorly known. Chen (1989) reported that the shellcoloration of H. diversicolor supertexta diﬀered accord-
ing to the algae consumed: it was green after consumingChlorophyceae and brown after consuming Rhodophy-
ceae. It seems conceivable that this abalone utilizes the
deposition process of new shell material to relocate
bioaccumulated recalcitrant chemicals from the meta-
bolically active soft tissues to the relatively inert shell

material. Karez et al. (1994) indicated that there was a
relative lack of information for contaminated regions intropical and subtropical areas regarding the ability ofabalone shell to accumulate heavy metals through non-
dietary and dietary processes in aquatic environments.
An ideal bioindicator should be sedentary, abundant
and exhibit longevity. It should be also easy to collect,able to accumulate pollutants and provide suﬃcient tis-sue for contaminant analysis. H. diversicolor supertexta
meets all of these conditions. Therefore, abalone shellcan be considered as an ideal biomaterial for environ-mental monitoring. Most of H. diversicolor supertexta
are used for seafood in Taiwan restaurants. The shells of
H. diversicolor supertexta can be obtained at minimal
cost from processing wastes. Belcher et al. (1998) indi-
cated that mollusk shell was a microlaminate composite
of mineral and biopolymers with exceptional regularity,and with a strength far exceeding that of the crystalsthemselves in that the calcium carbonate inorganic phaseof the shell contributes 98% of the shell mass. For ex-
ample, the shell of Haliotis rufescens , the red abalone, is
composed of two diﬀerent polymorphs of calcium car-bonate, calcite and aragonite (Belcher et al., 1996).
Zinc (Zn) is an essential micronutrient found at high
levels in the algae and in the tissues of ﬁsh/shellﬁsh(Hogstrand et al., 1998; Genter and Lehman, 2000). Ifwaterborne Zn levels are elevated, however, toxicity canoccur and have severe eﬀects on the health of H. diver-
sicolor supertexta , which will reduce market prices and
cause closure of abalone farms. Previous investigationsindicated that Zn was detected in many rivers and thatmaximum Zn concentrations in contaminated aquacul-tural waters were reported to range from 60 to 300 lgl
/C01
in diﬀerent areas of Taiwan (Lee et al., 1996). At these
levels, Zn speciﬁcally disrupts calcium uptake by the
gills of ﬁsh (Hogstrand et al., 1996; Galvez et al., 1998),
leading to hypocalcemia, which may end with the death
of the ﬁsh within a few days, depending on the Znconcentration.
This paper details a study to examine if shell of
H. diversicolor supertexta exposed to waterborne Zn
from dietary and nondietary routes via the alga G. tenui-
stipitata var.liuiand ambient water, respectively, can ac-
cumulate and eliminate Zn biokinetically in a controlledenvironment. To our knowledge, this study is the ﬁrst to
examine experimentally both the uptake and elimination
of Zn in the shell of H. diversicolor supertexta.
2. Methods
2.1. Experimental setup
Viable H. diversicolor supertexta andG. tenuistipitata
var. liuiwere collected for the laboratory exposure ex-
periments from Toucheng located in northern Taiwan,because this was the most Zn-contaminated area inTaiwan (Chen, 1989). The abalone and algal samplesinitially were washed in seawater to remove epiphytes
and kept at 4 /C176C during transfer to the laboratory.
Abalone with average shell length of 4.03 /C60.78 cm
were selected for the experiments. The algal samples
selected were mature, whole and healthy. A total of 200abalone were transferred into four aquatic tanks ofapproximately 54 l, containing 50 l of artiﬁcial seawater.In order to imitate the environment of the abalone
farms, the abalone were held in baskets. Each tankcontained 10 baskets. Four abalone per basket wereused for analysis. To be sure that at least four abalone
would be alive at the end of the experiment, we put one
extra abalone in each basket. Dissolved oxygen wasmaintained near saturation by aeration throughout theexperiment. The temperature and salinity were main-tained at 25 /C61.5/C176Ca n d3 5 ‰under constant illumi-
nation (Yang and Ting, 1986). The pH value remainedfairly constant during the experiment (7.75 /C60.24). The
abalone were fed daily with G. tenuistipitata var. liui.
The average Zn concentration in G. tenuistipitata var.
liuiobtained from Toucheng abalone farm was mea-
sured to be 91.04 /C633.10 lgg
/C01(mean /C6SE,n¼9). The
abalone were acclimatized for two weeks before theywere exposed to Zn.
In two tanks, Zn (ZnCl
2) was added to the seawater.
In one tank the abalone were fed with algae, and in theother tank, the abalone were kept without food. The Zn
level was determined by a preliminary experiment ex-
posing abalone to diﬀerent Zn concentrations (0.25, 0.5,1, 2, 4, and 6 ppm). The tolerance (LT

abalone were exposed to 1 lgm l/C01Zn for 7 days in this
experiment. The abalone were reared in the conta-minated environment for 7 days uptake, then trans-ferred to clean seawater and reared for 7 days ofdepuration. To examine if starvation aﬀects Zn depu-ration in abalone shell, the same procedure with abalonewas followed over 14 days using the other two tanks, but
without Zn in the seawater.
Abalone and water samples were collected at day 0, 1,
2, 4, and 7, starting from the day that those organismswere exposed to the contaminated seawater and fromthe day the organisms were transferred to clean sea-water. Each time one basket was taken along with 500ml water out of each tank. From this basket four aba-lone were collected. Because preliminary observations
showed that H. diversicolor supertexta only feeds at
night, and has an empty gut in the evening, we collectedthe abalone at night to make sure the contents of gutwould not inﬂuence the results. The experiments inthe four tanks, described above, were repeated again.The water samples were ﬁxed with 5 ml 1 N HNO
3, and
the samples of abalone were stored in the dark at )20/C176C
until they were analyzed.
2.2. Chemical analysis
The abalone shells were freeze-dried overnight, and
then ground into a ﬁne powder in a grinder (Tai-HsiangS36-89). A 500 mg portion of the ground samples wasdigested in 10 ml of 65% concentrated HNO
3overnight
at room temperature. The resulting solution was evap-orated and redissolved in 0.1 N HCl. A Perkins-Elmermodel 5100PC atomic absorption ﬂame spectro-
photometer (Perkins-Elmer, Shelton, Connecticut, USA)
equipped with an HGA-300 graphite furnace atomizerwas used to analyze Zn. Analytical quality control wasachieved by digesting and analyzing identical amountsof rehydrated (90% H
2O) standard reference materials
(DORM-2, Dogﬁsh Liver-2-organic matrix, NRC-CNRC, Canada). Recovery rates ranged from 95% to97% and the levels of detection were 0.5 lg Zn/g shell
and 5 lg Zn/l water.
2.3. Data analysis
Uptake and depuration rate constants were deter-
mined by ﬁtting concentration data to the integratedform of the kinetic rate equation for constant dietary/nondietary Zn exposure, using iterative nonlinear re-
gression,

where Csis the Zn concentration in abalone shell
(lgg/C01),Cw, the dissolved Zn concentration in water(lgm l/C01),k1, the uptake rate constant for Zn of shell
(ml g/C01d/C01), and k2, the depuration rate constant for Zn
of shell (d/C01). The bioconcentration factor (BCF) is
calculated from the equation BCF ¼k1=k2.
As the ﬁrst-order one-compartment model assumes
that k2is not a function of Zn concentration in shell, k2
is often determined by depurating contaminated or-
ganisms in uncontaminated water and determining k2
directly in that test organism. Therefore, after the aba-
lone are transferred to clean water and diet tank, re-spectively, the depuration rate constant ðk

calculated by the linear regression of log-transformedshell Zn concentrations on depuration time (days) aslnC

culated as ln 2 =k2. Variances in k2values derived from
two methods were tested for homogeneity using an
F-test. Values were then compared using t-test. All curve
ﬁttings were performed using the nonlinear regressionoption of the Statistica
/C226software (StatSoft, Tulsa, OK,
USA). Statistica/C226was also used to calculate the coeﬃ-
cient of determination ðr2Þand to perform all statistical
comparisons.
3. Results and discussion
The nonlinear regression resulting from the best ﬁts
of Eq. (1) to uptake and depuration concentration data
for dietary and nondietary exposure is shown in Fig. 1.

experimentally determined biokinetic parameters for the
Eq. (1) describing the Zn bioaccumulation process inthe shell of H. diversicolor supertexta exposed to Zn from
dietary and nondietary routes are summarized in Table1. A simple, well-established, one-compartment uptake-
depuration model in Eq. (1) was thus ﬁtted by thenonlinear technique to the 14 d exposure data and the
average coeﬃcient of determination ðr
2Þwas 0.68 (Table
1). Estimates of k2were also determined from the de-
puration phases. All of these regressions were signiﬁcantðp<0:05Þ, with coeﬃcient of determination values
ranging from 0.32 to 0.62 (Table 1).
The BCF of abalone shell in the uptake phase (107.56
ml g
/C01) was greater than that in the depuration phase
(53.33 ml g/C01) during dietary exposure, whereas the re-
sult was opposite in the nondietary exposure (Table 1).
Analysis of variance showed that the uptake rate con-
stant of shell of H. diversicolor supertexta in dietary
exposure was not diﬀerent from that of nondietaryC.-M. Liao et al. / Bioresource Technology 91 (2004) 117–121 119exposure ( F¼0:015, p>0:05). There were also no
signiﬁcant diﬀerences between dietary and nondietary
exposure regarding BCFs ( F¼0:543, p>0:05). Theresults from the experiments without Zn indicated that
Zn concentrations in abalone shell in dietary exposurewere not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from those in nondietaryexposure ( F¼0:46,p>0:05), suggesting that the eﬀect
of starvation can be overlooked during the experimentalexposure period.
There was some accumulation of Zn in control aba-
lone shell (14.4 lgg
/C01at day 0 in Fig. 1) due to the
unavoidable presence of trace amounts at the abalone
farm. During dietary exposure, the abalone shell con-tinued to accumulate Zn in the uptake phase, leading toslower depuration rate (0.048 d
/C01) compared to that in
the depuration phase (0.096 d/C01), whereas the absence of
algae in nondietary exposure resulted in a higher depu-ration rate in the uptake phase compared to that in thedepuration phase (Table 1). The half-life of the uptake
phase in dietary exposure (14.44 d) was larger than that
in nondietary exposure (6.93 d). In the depurationphase, the half-life in nondietary exposure (15.4 d) waslarger than that in dietary exposure (7.22 d).
The results demonstrated that shell of H. diversicolor
supertexta accumulated considerable amounts of Zn
from seawater. The quantity of heavy metals in shell ofmollusks clearly reﬂects the quantity of the heavy metals
in the aquatic environment where mollusks grow (Ber-
tine and Goldberg, 1972; Walsh et al., 1995), suggestingthat the shell of H. diversicolor supertexta can poten-
tially be a useful bioindicator for the bioaccumulation ofZn in artiﬁcial and natural environments. The percentdiﬀerence between uptake rate constants in dietary andnondietary exposure was 5.5%, indicating that Zn in
abalone shell was from ambient water and not from the
algae. A similar conclusion was reported by Amiard-
Triquet et al. (1987) where they demonstrated that Znlevels in algae-grazing mollusks, Gibbula umbillicalis and
Littorina littorea , were not diﬀerent from Zn levels in a
brown alga, Fucus serratus , which was the food species
of the mollusks.
Bertine and Goldberg (1972) and Walsh et al. (1995)
demonstrated that heavy metals were usually higher in
the soft parts than those in the solid shell of clams,
mussels and shrimps. The presence of contaminants in01020304050

eﬀective and sensitive means to assess contamination in
the soft tissue of this organism and to monitor the
aquatic ecosystems. Based on these characteristics, theZn levels in shell of H. diversicolor supertexta indicate
the Zn levels in water. Walsh et al. (1995) suggested thatalthough the Zn in abalone shell was less than in softtissue, the shell was still useful as an indicator, yet the
amount of Zn in shell was proportional to the concen-
tration in soft tissue. Results from this study suggestthat a certain fraction of the elimination of Zn may bedue to biotransformation and not just a physical diﬀu-sion-related elimination process.
4. Conclusions
This study has provided biokinetic data for uptake
and elimination of Zn by shell of H. diversicolor super-
texta , which are essential for developing predictive
models of Zn accumulation in ﬁeld aquacultural eco-systems. Results from this study imply that abalone shellcould act as a toxic waste sink to remove waterborneheavy metals from the metabolically active tissue and
therefore eﬀectively eliminate these metals from the food
chain in that the relocation of the contaminants to theshell represents an eﬀective detoxiﬁcation mechanism.The use of abalone shell as a bioindicator may be usefulfor determining the extent of biotransformation inaquatic food webs, as an essential component of riskassessment of heavy metals.
