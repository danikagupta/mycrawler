Abstract—  Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to 
optimize the methylene blue adsorption onto Luffa Cylindrica  fibers.  
The individual effects, as well as the interactions between variables 
such as pH and initial concentration dye were studied. From a Pareto 
chart, it appears that the most significant effect is clearly that of the maximum dye concentration. Such effect can be graphically verified 
through response surfaces and contour line plots. The optimum 
concentrations of dye, and pH were found to be 97.25 mg/dm
3 and 
pH 4.17 respectively, for maximu m MB adsorption (83.44 mg/g). A 
quadratic model was obtained for dye adsorption through this design. 
The experimental values were in good agreement with predicted 
values and the model was highly significant, the correlation 
coefficient being 0.9906. Increased adsorption was observed with 
increase in dye initial concentration at lower pH. Interaction between 
MB concentration and pH was neg ligible. The optimization of dye 
concentration is independent of pH. 
Adsorption kinetics to optimal conditions determinated by RSM 
was investigated.

I. INTRODUCTION  
RINCIPALLY ,  textile industry discharge to natural water 
sources colored effluents with pigments and dyes that are 
toxic and have carcinogenic and mutagenic effects [1].  
Treatment of the textile dye containing effluent is difficult 
and ineffective with conventional biological processes because 
many synthetic dyes are very stable to light, temperature and 
resistant to microbial attack. Many treatment processes have 
been applied for the removal of dyes from wastewater such as: photocatalytic degradation, sonochemical degradation, 
micellar enhanced ultrafiltration, cation exchange membranes, electrochemical degradation, adsorption/precipitation processes, integrated chemical–biological degradation, 
integrated iron(III) photoassisted-biological treatment, solar photo-Fenton and biological processes, Fenton-biological 
treatment scheme and adsorption on activated carbon.

C. Gómez is with the Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Facultad de 
Minas, Medellín COLOMBIA. Unfortunately, these methods of effluent treatment have 
high operating costs and limited applicability. As synthetic 
dyes in wastewater cannot be efficiently decolorized by 
traditional methods, the adsorption of synthetic dyes on 
inexpensive and efficient solid supports was considered as a 
simple and economical method for their removal from water 
and wastewater [2]. 
Adsorption is a well known equilibrium separation process 
and an effective method for water decontamination 
applications [3]. The accumulation and concentration of dyes 
from aqueous solutions by the use of biological materials is termed bioadsorption. Bioadsorption is a novel approach, 
competitive, effective and cheap.  
Luffa cylindrica is lignocellulosic material that can be used 
as bioadsorbent because  its fibrous vascular system, allows it 
removal of water pollutants as dyes. Therefore tough fibers 
can promise as being processed into industrial products such 
as filters. In removal processes, it is recommended that the capacities be taken as specific set of conditions rather than as 
maximum adsorption capacities.  
Response surface methodology (RSM) is a collection of 
useful mathematical and statistical techniques for analyzing the effects of several independent variables. In many processes, the relationship between the response and 
independent variables is unknown; therefore, the first step in 
RSM is to approximate the function (response) in terms of analyzing the independent variables. Usually, this process 
employs a low-order polynomial equation in a predetermined region of the independent variables, which will later be analyzed to locate the optimum values of independent 
variables for the optimum response [4]. 
The purpose of the present study was evaluated the 
methylene blue adsorption on Luffa Cylindrica , using RSM to 
optimize the main parameters affecting process such as the initial concentration of dye (MB) and pH.  Kinetics parameters 
were investigated to determine the ratio of reaction time 
versus adsorbed amounts under optimized conditions certained by RSM.

 were cut for reducing dimensions to 2–3 mm. Fibers were 
pretreated in order to increase hydrophilicity by NaOH boiling 
solution 0.1 M during 20 min. Fibers were washed with 
deionized water until whole sodium hydroxide was removed. After washing, they were dried in oven at 70°C for 6 h. 
Chloride acid (Carlo Erba), sodium hydroxide (Sigma, 99%), methylene blue (Merck) were used in the experiments. 
B. Methods  
In all experiments, 80 mg of dried luffa fibers were 
immersed in 100 cm
3 MB solutions according to experimental 
conditions.  For building a response surface plot, it is necessary to consider a full-composite experimental design 
which consists of a 2
k factorial design with central and star 
points, where k corresponds to the number of selected 
variables or main effects [5]. In this case, the chosen response variable was the MB adsorbed on fibers and the levels of the 
main effects were established from the obtained results in previous works [1,6,7]. The main effects and their levels used 
for this experimental design were set as follows: A, initial 
concentration of MB, 25 – 85 mg/dm
3; B, initial pH, 5 – 9. 
The concentrations of the solution samples were measured using a Spectroquant Pharo 300 Merck UV–Vis visible spectrophotometer. The amount of MB adsorbed onto Luffa 
fibers after shaking for 5 h. was estimated from mass balance according to Eq. (1):

where C0 and C  correspond to the initial and the final 
concentration in liquid phase, mg/dm3; V is volume of the 
solution, l; and M is mass of the luffa fibers, g.  
The coefficients of the linear and quadratic effects of the 
mathematical model obtained from the statistical analysis were 
estimated using a multilinear regression analysis of minimal 
squares.  The equations used for describing quantitatively the dye adsorption and the response surface plots were analyzed 
and interpreted with the Statgraphics® 5.1 software Trial 
Version. 
The kinetics of the adsorption was researched by 
performing batch experiment at ambient temperature (288 K) 
to optimal conditions of MB initial concentration and pH 
(97.42 mg/dm
3, 4.17 respectively) and fixed amount of Luffa 
fiber (80 mg).

The results of the experimental runs are listed in Table I. 
and the mathematical model obtained from these data is described by Eq. (2).

 The individual effects of various parameters as well as their interactions can be discussed from the Pareto chart illustrated 
by Fig. 1, the Pareto chart being an option of Statgraphics Plus 5.1 for Windows. The length of each bar is proportional to the 
absolute value of its associated regression coefficient or estimated effect.  
 The effects of all parameters, interactions as well as quadratic 
terms, are standardized (each effect is divided by its standard 
error). The order in which the bars are displayed corresponds to the order of the size of the effect. The chart includes a 
vertical line that corresponds to the 95% limit indicating statistical significance. An effect is, therefore, significant if its 
corresponding bar crosses this vertical line [8]. 
 
 
Fig. 1 Pareto chart of standardized effects for MB adsorption  
 
From Fig. 1, the most significant parameter is clearly the 
MB initial concentration (A). Its quadratic effect (AA) 
indicates that this variable is outstanding during the process 
and its behavior presents a maximum that changes slope for its 
quadratic behavior in some moment. The simple effect of acidity (B), its quadratic effect (BB) and the interaction MB 
concentration–pH appear actually low and are not significant. 
Fig. 2 illustrates that there is not interaction between effects 
pH–MB concentration.  When the MB concentration increases 
from 25.0 to 85.0 mg/dm
3, the change in the amount of 
adsorbed MB does not differ with the level of pH. A 
maximum value in adsorbed MB is observed not only at the higher level of pH but also at the lower one  and, the gap 
between both curves is not large enough to conclude a significant interaction effect between variables. The low interactive effect between pH and MB initial concentration is 
obvious.

The results of analysis of variance (ANOVA) are shown in 
Table II which indicates that the predictability of the model is 
at 95% confidence interval. The predicted response fitted well 
with those of the experimentally obtained response. Further 
the computed F value to A factor (397.88) is much greater than that of the tabular F
0.05,1,4  value (7.71) suggesting that the 
MB concentration is highly significant. A P value less than 
0.01 indicated that the factor is statistically significant. The 
factor also revealed  statistically insignificant lack of fit, as is 
evident from the lower computed F value. 
 
Fig. 3 shows the incidence of the main effects on the MB 
adsorption. The most incident effect was the MB 
concentration. This behavior is according to analysis from 
Pareto Chart.

 The various effects of the operating variables can be 
graphically observed from the response surfaces and the 
contour plots of the target variable, MB adsorbed. Fig. 4 
shows the response surface of MB adsorption onto Luffa 
Cylindrica  fibers as a function of two independent variables, 
(MB concentration and pH). The shape of the response 
surface, similar to plane and few distorted, is  an indication of 
the low interactive effects between variables. Therefore, Fig. 4 shows little interaction between pH and MB initial 
concentration.

Generally, it is important to assess the fitted model to 
ensure that it gives sufficient approximation of the results 
obtained in the experimental conditions. A check of the normality assumption can be made by constructing a normal 
probability plot of the residuals as given in Fig. 5. The 
normality assumption is satisfied if the residuals plot approximated along a straight line. 
 
 
Fig. 5 Normal probability plot for residuals.  
 
 The coefficient of multiple regression, R2, is another 
statistical parameter to access the fit of a model. In the present 
model, R2 was 0.9906, which indicates the fitness of the 
model. For further validation of the model, adjusted R2 was 
used for confirming the model adequacy. The adjusted R2 was 
calculated to be 0.9788, which indicates a good model for 
using in the field conditions.  
Examination of the residuals should be an automatic part of 
any analysis of variance. If model is adequate, the residuals should be structureless; that is, they should contain no obvious 
patterns [5]. The polynomial function leads to a satisfactory prediction of MB adsorption onto Luffa Cylindrica  described 
in Eq. 2 can be illustrated by Fig. 6.

MB adsorption. 
 
As discussed above, the variable MB initial concentration 
had significant effect, as well as their quadratic interaction so 
that the results shown on Fig. 4 have a particular importance. 
Therefore, an optimal set of both, the variables MB initial concentration and pH, can be approximately deduced from the 
shape of the contour lines on Fig. 4. This optimal set is shown  in Table III. 
   
B. Kinetics study  
Fig. 7 shows the kinetics of MB adsorption onto Luffa 
Cylindrica fibers corresponding to optimal condition 
determinated by RSM analysis showed in Table III. This way, 
MB initial concentration and pH condition used to kinetics 
studies were 97.42 mg/dm
3 and 4.17 respectively.

 The adsorption isotherms were evaluated by using 
Langmuir and Freundlich equations [9]. Langmuir isotherm is 
represented by Eq. 3

where 
KL= Langmuir constant (dm3/mg), 
q = MB concentration in fiber (mg/g), 
C = MB concentration in solution (mg/dm3), 
qm= MB concentration when monolayer forms onto fiber 
(mg/g).

where K
f = sorption capacity, 
n = sorption intensity. 
The Freundlich constants of the isotherms Kf and n were 
found by drawing log q versus log C (8.369×10–4 mg/g, – 
1.3068). Langmuir constants qm and K L were evaluated by 
plotting 1/ q versus 1/C (18.083 mg/g, –0.0259 dm3/mg, 
respectively). These values show that the adsorption model 
constants of MB on luffa fibers can be described by the 
Langmuir equation since a higher linear regression correlation 
coefficient, R2, of 0.97 was obtained for this model. 
IV. CONCLUSIONS  
Dye absorption onto Luffa Cylindrica fibers could be 
optimized by way of an experimental design methodology as a 
central composite with axial points, allowed on the one hand 
to classify the effects of each of the parameters, and 
parameters, on the other hand, to emphasize their interactions and quadratic effects. Moreover, we could determine a 
statistical model in a polynomial form obviously available in the domain of investigation of the tested parameters. In the 
present work, this domain appears, nevertheless, a little too 
restricted. Only MB initial concentration had an effect over 
response variable but its quadratic effect implies a change 
slope in some point. Kinetics studies on MB adsorption on L. 
cylindrica  fiber revealed that the MB adsorption is a pseudo–
first order reaction defined by Langmuir model with linear 
regression correlation coefficient 0.97. 
Luffa  fibers promises being a new adsorbent for removing 
dye from aqueous solution since it is renewable and sustainable and shows adsorption capacity as what were 
investigated by other researchers in the literature.
