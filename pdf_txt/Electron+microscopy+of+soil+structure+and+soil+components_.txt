ABSTRACT 
Soil is often intensively manipulated by tillage, equipment traffic, 
and preparation for laboratory analysis. Realizing that manipulated 
and reconstituted soils have been and are being used in soil structure 
research, we used surface-soil samples of cultivated and nonculti- 
vated Reading silt loam (fine, mixed, mesic, Typic Argiudolls) to 
evaluate the effects of simulated tillage on soil structure and to de- 
termine how well the structures of disturbed soils represent the 
structures of nondisturbed soils of similar composition. Soil cores 
86 by 60 mm were formed after the following treatments had been 
applied: ultrasonically dispersed and freeze-dried, crushed and passed 
through a 2-mm sieve, and nondisturbed. The soil structural differ- 
ences were evaluated by soil-water-characteristic curves, saturated- 
hydraulic conductivities, compression indices, bulk densities, wet- 
and dry-aggregate stabilities, and scanning-electron-microscopy. The 
results show that the soil structures of reconstituted, intensively or 
even mildly manipulated soils differ considerably from the nondis- 
turbed soils of the same makeup. The greater the disturbance, the 
greater the differences between the nondisturbed and disturbed soils. 
The main differences were caused by the destruction of cements and 
bridges between individual aggregates, which create large, com- 
pound-unit (ped) structures.

OIL STRUCTURAL properties have been evaluated S by various techniques. Many studies have looked 
at the aggregate stabilities (wet and dry) and aggregate 
distributions of noncultivated and cultivated, nondis- 
turbed and disturbed soils (1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 15, 20, 21, 22, 
24, 27, p. 753, 29). Most of the tests were completed 
in the laboratory and the results showed that manip- 
ulating soils in the field almost always weakened the 
soils' structural integrity. Weaker structures were ob- 
served in lower wet- and dry-aggregate stabilities (7, 
20, 24, 27, p. 753, 29), higher bulk densities (2, 24), 
and lower porosites (2, 28). Other measurements that 
have evaluated soil structure included compressions 
(1 1, 13, 19, 23), penetration resistances (14, 23, 28), 
saturated-hydraulic conductivities and permeabilities 
(4, 24), and clod strengths (12, 24). 
Our objective was to evaluate the effects of simu- 
lated tillage on soil structure and determine how well 
the structure of disturbed soils represented the struc- 
ture of nondisturbed soils of similar composition. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Nondisturbed and disturbed samples of the Reading silt 
loam (fine, mixed, mesic, Typic Argiudolls) from nonculti- 
vated prairie and an adjacent cultivated field were obtained 
for testing from the Konza Prairie Research Natural Area 
16 km south of Manhattan, KS. The non-cultivated soil had 
never been tilled; the cultivated soil was mainly used be- 
tween 1940 and 1970 for grazing with legumes that were 
frequently plowed under. Since 1970, conventional tillage 
with grain crops has been the practice. 
879 Samples were taken from the surface soils (1 0 to 70 mm 
deep) on two occasions, July 1979 and 1980. Five replica- 
tions of nondisturbed, soil-core samples (86 by 60 mm) were 
taken with a double cylinder, hammer-driven, soil core sam- 
pler (3, 23). Several kilograms of soil were obtained with a 
shovel for the disturbed samples. Approximately one-half of 
the disturbed sample was ultrasonically dispersed (soni- 
cated) and then freeze-dried. The remaining portion was 
crushed and passed through a 2-mm sieve. 
The disturbed soils, both sonicated and crushed, were re- 
molded into soil cores (86 by 60 mm) similar to the method 
of Chen and Banin (6). The soil was poured through a funnel 
into the cylinders and compacted by dropping the cylinders 
and soil 100 times through a distance of 1 cm. They were 
then soaked by capillarity and dried at 2 1 "C. 
The physical and structural differences among treated 
samples were measured by the following methods. The soil- 
core and clod-bulk densities of all initial samples were de- 
termined by methods similar to those of Blake (3) except 
we dried the cores at 2 1 "C and used kerosene as the known- 
density liquid in testing the clods. Wet-aggregate stability 
was determined by direct immersion of the 2.0 and 0.84 mm 
aggregate-size fraction by method described by Kemper (1 6). 
We used a 152-mm-diam sieve (60 mesh screen, 0.25 mm 
in diam) and a 30-g soil sample. Our mechanical sieving 
machine lowered and raised the sieve holder through a dis- 
tance of 27 mm 25 times per min. Results are reported as 
the fraction of the initial soil sample remaining on the sieve 
after sieving. 
The procedure described by Skidmore and Powers (25) 
was used to determine dry-aggregate stability of the treated 
samples. Soil aggregates were crushed by diametrically load- 
ing between parallel plates of an Instron3 universal-testing 
instrument. The energy of crushing was determined and the 
surface area of aggregates after crushing was calculated to 
give energy of crushing per unit of new surface area (J/m2). 
Saturated-hydraulic conductivities were measured by fall- 
inghead methods similar to those outlined by Klute (1 8). 
Compression indices were determined by the procedure 
of Larson et al. (1 9). Nine successive increments of load 
stress ranging from 0.01 to 2.45 MPa were applied to soils 
in 86- by 60-mm brass cylinders. The soil sample rested on 
a porous ceramic plate. Replicates were run with the soil 
initially at two soil-water contents corresponding to soil-water 
pressures of - 30 and - 1UO kPa. The volume of the sample 
was measured at each equilibrium point, and bulk densities 
were calculated. The slope of bulk density vs. the logarithm 
of the applied stress of the linear portion of the curve (0.07- 
1.5 MPa range) determined the compression index. 
Soil clods 5 to 10 mm in diam, from before and after 
compression, were mounted and glued with a colloidal paste 
on aluminum biological stubs. The mounted samples were 
stored in a dessicator until viewing on the scanning-electron 
microscope (SEM) was possible. The specimens were coated 
with carbon and with a 60/40 gold palladium alloy before 
viewing on the SEM (IO). The prepared samples were ex- 
amined for differences in structure of soil aggregates with a 
ETEC U-1 scanning-electron microscope3 at 2.5, 5.0, and

Analyses of variance and least significant differences were 
determined at 0.05 and 0.01 confidences. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The aggregates formed from the soil that had been 
previously crushed or dispersed were very weak unless 
compressed (Table 1). Their resistance to breaking into 
smaller units was low. Less than 0.2 J of energy was 
required for each m2 of newly exposed surface area on 
all samples, whereas before disruption, 7.2 and 12.5 
J/m2 were required for the cultivated and nonculti- 
vated surface soils, respectively. The wetting and 
drying cycles of the soil-packed cylinders did not re- 
form firm aggregates. 
Compression of the soils at 2.45 MPa greatly in- 
creased the clods’ stability. The stability of the crush/ 
sieve and sonicated samples both increased more than 
a hundredfold. After compression, the disturbed sam- 
ples were two to three times more stable than the orig- 
inal disturbed samples but still only half to two-thirds 
as stable as the nondisturbed after compression. 
The samples of the noncultivated, nondisturbed soil 
may be thought of as ped fragments. Considering the 
definition of peds and clods, we are to some extent 
comparing stabilities of clods and peds (in this paper 
we are referring to both as aggregates). Peds are de- 
fined (26, p. 36, 5,25) as individual units of soil struc- 
ture formed in natural processes, whereas clods are 
coherent masses of soil formed or molded by such 
activities of man as plowing or digging (9, 17).

The nondisturbed, cultivated sample with an aggre- 
gate stability of 7.2 J/m2 behaved more like a ped than 
did the crushed and sonicated and remolded samples 
with very weak structure. 
Wet-aggregate stabilities of the samples that were 
most severely treated (sonicated), then formed into 
soil cylinders for testing, were much less than the field- 
sampled aggregates (Table 2). In this case the nondis- 
turbed and crush/sieve, although statistically different, 
are similar. In all cases, the sonicated samples were 
much less stable than samples from either of the other 
two treatments, but compressing the noncultivated soil 
doubled wet-aggregate stabilities. Compression, in this 
case, seems to have helped remold these highly dis- 
turbed soils. Compressing the nondisturbed and crush/ 
sieve treated samples, except the noncultivated, non- 
disturbed ones, decreased the soils’ stabilities approx- 
imately 25% so the crush/sieve treatments had about 
the same effect on soil stability as did cultivation. The 
noncultivated, nondisturbed soil samples had a more 
stable aggregate structure after compression than any 
other samples. 
Compression of the samples increased dry-aggregate 
stability and decreased wet-aggregate stability. This 
forcing of the particles into closer proximity to each 
other created a compact unit more resistant in a dry 
state than previously to disruption from physical 
forces. Compression also broke bonds that had formed 
during natural aggregation, which had been more re- 
sistant to the disruptive action of differential swelling 
and entrapped-air exploding of water-submerged ag- 
gregates.

had soil-water-characteristic curves considerably dif- 
ferent from those for the nondisturbed samples (Fig. 
1 and 2). The general trend was for sonicated soils to 
have the highest volumetric water content at each soil- 
water pressure between - 1 and - 10 kPa and the non- 
disturbed soils to have the lowest water contents in 
this range. In the - 10 to - 100 kPa range, all dis- 
turbed samples lost water content until they had less 
soil water at corresponding pressure than did the non- 
disturbed samples. The cultivated soils also had higher 
water contents at each soil-water pressure than the 
noncultivated, which showed the same general trend 
in cultivation and manipulation effect.

range for disturbed soils might stem from their large 
aggregate surface areas attracting more water than the 
nondisturbed, and their early drainage in the - 10 to - 30 kPa range might stem from their larger percent- 
age of small pore spaces, which drain out at these pres- 
sures. 
The nondisturbed samples seemed to have more 
uniform distribution of pore space. The sonicated 
samples, as expected, had the highest water contents 
between -1 and -10 kPa and lost the most water 
between - 10 and - 30 kPa of any samples. They were 
followed by the crush/sieve and then the nondisturbed 
samples, which had increasingly lower water contents

Saturated hydraulic conductivities tended to vary 
with the bulk density of the soils but showed the ef- 
fects of disturbing soils (Table 3). For both the non- 
cultivated and cultivated soils, the disturbed samples 
had significantly lower bulk densities, due to remold- 
ing of the disturbed soils, than did the nondisturbed 
samples. Of all samples, the noncultivated soils had 
higher saturated hydraulic-conductivities than did 
corresponding cultivated samples, emphasizing the 
degrading effects of cultivation. Sonication of both soils 
caused their conductivities to be significantly lower 
than those with other treatments except when com- 
pared with the cultivated, nondisturbed sample, which 
was lowest. 
When bulk densities were accounted for, we could 
conclude that sonication and cultivation have similar 
degrading effects upon soil-water conductivities and 
structures. Crushing, sieving, and remolding soils sig- 
nificantly increased the conductivities of cultivated 
soils, probably due to the percentage of larger pore 
spaces between individual aggregates. That might be 
expected in cultivated fields during the first rain after 
plowing the top 70 mm of soil. 
Initially, the bulk densities of the nondisturbed 
samples were higher than the disturbed (crush/sieve 
and sonicated) samples. After compression, there was little difference between the bulk densities (Table 4). 
There were, however, some important trends in that 
in all cases the crush/sieve and sonicated samples went 
from the lowest bulk densities before compression to 
the highest bulk densities after compression. This 
shows the greater compressibility and weaker struc- 
ture of these samples and correlates well with the 
compression results (Table 4). The larger the values 
of the compression index, the steeper the slope and 
more compressible the soil. 
In each case, the nondisturbed were less compress- 
ible than the crush/sieve or sonicated samples, as in- 
dicated previously by the bulk-density results. The 
noncultivated, nondisturbed sample was less com- 
pressible than its cultivated counterpart. Results of the 
crush/sieve samples show that the manipulation and 
compression effects were greater on noncultivated than 
on cultivated soils (Table 4). The sonicated soils had 
the highest compression indices, the steepest slopes, 
the most compressible soils, and the weakest struc- 
tures between and within the aggregates and particles. 
The scanning-electron-microscope photographs ver- 
ified the results of the other experiments (Fig. 3-5). 
The noncultivated, nondisturbed surface soil (Fig. 3A) 
had primary particles and aggregates bridged (bonded) 
together into large compound units (peds) separated 
by cleavage planes. The structures of the nonculti- 
vated, crush/sieve and sonicated samples (Fig. 3B-C) POWERS & SKIDMORE SOIL STRUCTURE AS INFLUENCED BY SIMULATED TILLAGE 883

structure, we found that disturbing or manipulating 
the soils (crush/sieve and sonicated treatments) sig- 884 SOIL SCI. SOC. AM. J., VOL. 48, 1984 
nificantly degraded their structural stability but in var- 
ious degrees. The more the soil was disturbed (soni- 
cation), the more its structure was degraded. Disturbing 
the soils had less effect upon the cultivated soils than 
the noncultivated, especially upon the moisture char- 
acteristic curves, saturated-hydraulic conductivities, 
and compression indices probably because of the de- 
grading effects that had already been produced on the 
cultivated surface soil compared with the nonculti- 
vated soil. Disturbing soils for whatever purpose dis- 
rupts their structure in various degrees, depending on 
the amount and kind of disturbance. Determining how 
much disruption should be allowed to retain beneficial 
and reliable information is an important item to as- 
certain. 
Conclusions can be made regarding how well these 
disturbed soils represent the nondisturbed soils in 
structural stability. First and overall, the soil struc- 
tures of the disturbed samples differed significantly 
from and were usually less stable than the soil struc- 
tures of the nondisturbed samples. In most cases. the 
severely treated (sonicated) samples were more unlike 
the nondisturbed samples than were the crush/sieve. 
Second, the disturbed cultivated samples, particularly 
the crush/sieve samples, were most like their nondis- 
turbed comparisons. Finally, wet- and dry-aggregate 
stabilities, the moisture-characteristic curves, bulk 
densities, compression indices, and, in most cases, the 
saturated-hydraulic conductivities gave information 
helpful in evaluating structural differences. 
The SEM photographs helped to confirm all of the 
indicated results of the other soil-structure measure- 
ments (Fig. 3-5). The nondisturbed soils had many 
more insoluble (probably organic) bonds between the 
individual particles and aggregates than did the dis- 
turbed soils (crush/sieve or sonicated), so the nondis- 
turbed soils had better aggregate structures. The bonds 
caused larger initial dry- and wet aggregate stabilities 
(Tables 1-2), which made the nondisturbed soils less 
compressible. When these bonds were broken during 
compression, the resultant soils of all treatments (ex- 
cept the noncultivated, nondisturbed surface soil with 
the most such bonds) were very similar. Compression 
increased all soils' dry-aggregate stabilities but de- 
creased wet-aggregate stabilities of nondisturbed and 
crush/sieve samples. 
The soils with the most interconnecting bonds. the 
noncultivated and then cultivated, nondisturbed soils 
had the most stable structures followed in order by 
the crush/sieve, sonicated, and compressed soils. The 
disturbed soils (crush/sieve) were representative for 
the nondisturbed only in individual particle struc- 
tures, not at all in their large compound-unit. inter- 
aggregate structures. Large structural differences were 
found amoung soils that were nondisturbed, and 
among those that were crushed and sieved or soni- 
cated and then remolded.
