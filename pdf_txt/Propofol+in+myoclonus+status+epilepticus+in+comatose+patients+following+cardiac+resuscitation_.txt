Neurologic Prognosis in Cardiac Arrest Patients Treated
With Therapeutic Hypothermia
Nicholas A. Blondin, MD and David M. Greer, MD, MA, FCCP
Background: Therapeutic hypothermia is now commonly used to im-
prove neurologic outcomes in eligible patients after cardiac arrest. Thephysiologic effects of cooling and pharmacologic effects of sedativesand neuromuscular blocking agents can affect the clinical exam andneurophysiologic ﬁndings. This can lead to uncertainty in neurologicprognostication. In this article, we review data on assessing prognosis
in patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia.
Review Summary: Features of the clinical examination, neurophy-
siologic testing (including somatosensory-evoked potentials and
electroencephalography), serum/cerebrospinal ﬂuid biomarkers and
neuroimaging can be used to help predict prognosis. However, nosingle test can predict poor prognosis with absolute certainty. Giventhe features that help to predict poor, indeterminate, or good outcome,we provide practical advice in assessing neurologic prognosis aftercardiac arrest in patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia.
Conclusions: The American Academy of Neurology practice parameters
for assessing prognosis after cardi ac arrest may not be accurate for
patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia. Application of theseguidelines may lead to overly pessimistic prognostication and premature
withdrawal of care. If uncertainty exists regarding the prognosis in a given
patient after cardiac arrest, additional time should be allowed to pass, aspatients may ultimately recover with good neurologic outcome.
Key Words: hypothermia, prognosis, cardiac arrest
(The Neurologist 2011;17:241–248)
Within the past decade, therapeutic hypothermia has
emerged as the standard of care for eligible patients
resuscitated after cardiac arrest.1Therapeutic hypothermia has
been found to decrease morbidity and mortality, and has led to
improved neurologic outcomes.2–5However, hypothermia has
also introduced new challenges to the prediction of outcome in
survivors of cardiac arrest. This review will examine new
evidence for assessing neurologic prognosis in patients treatedwith therapeutic hypothermia.
In a standard therapeutic hypothermia protocol, patients
undergo cooling for 24 hours to a target temperature of 33 1C
(range, 32 1C-34 1C) using either surface-based or catheter-
based cooling methods. During the cooling period, patients aresedated, typically with benzodiazepines, opioids, propofol, or a
combination of these agents. Neuromuscular blockade toprevent shivering is also frequently given with a nondepolar-
izing neuromuscular blocking agent such as vecuronium.
After 24 hours from the time of induction of hypothermia,
controlled rewarming takes place over the next 8 to 12 hours.Paralytic agents, followed by sedatives and analgesics, aretapered off after the patient is rewarmed. After rewarming,
efforts are made to minimize sedation, which is then typically
used for purposes of patient comfort. However, some patientsare maintained on anticonvulsant medications owing to con-
cerns for, or evidence of, seizures.
The sedation and neuromuscular blockade used during
hypothermia result in pharmacologic effects that can make theclinical examination unreliable. Although these medications
may be weaned by 48 hours after cardiac arrest, sedatives are
commonly used up to 72 hours and beyond.
6The pharmaco-
kinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of sedatives, analge-sics, and neuromuscular blocking agents are altered during
hypothermia. Hypothermia can also decrease hepatic and renal
drug clearance.
7–9Signiﬁcant increases in serum midazolam,
fentanyl, and propofol concentrations may occur duringhypothermia.
8,10,11
Owing to the persistent presence and effects of sedatives
and paralytic agents, as well as the physiologic effects ofhypothermia, caution needs to be exercised when attempting to
interpret the clinical examination and neurophysiologic ﬁnd-
ings. Abnormalities in the pupillary light response, other brain-stem reﬂexes, and the motor aspects of the neurologicexamination may be signiﬁcant. The results of electrophysiologic
tests, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and somatosensory-
evoked potentials (SSEPS), can also be affected by drugs andsystemic metabolic derangements.
Neurologists are often asked to assess prognosis and pre-
dict functional outcome. A commonly used outcome measure
is the Glasgow-Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance Categories(CPC) scale.
12,13A CPC of 1 indicates full recovery, CPC 2
indicates moderate disability, and CPC 3 indicates severe
neurologic disability but preserved consciousness. Patientswith CPC 4 are comatose or in a persistent vegetative state, andthose with CPC 5 have died. In this review, a “good outcome”
reﬂects a CPC of 1 or 2 and a “poor outcome” reﬂects a CPC of
4 or 5, where a patient never regains consciousness. Whether toassign a CPC score of 3 as good outcome or poor outcomeis controversial; a severe disability may not be considered a
poor outcome in the setting of a patient who has been in coma
from cardiac arrest, as some would wish to survive even withsigniﬁcant neurologic disabilities but with preservation of
consciousness.
The current American Academy of Neurology (AAN)
practice parameters do not take the potential inﬂuenceof induced therapeutic hypothermia into consideration.

The Neurologist /C15Volume 17, Number 5, September 2011 www.theneurologist.org |241hypothermia.14As hypothermia is now in widespread practice,
new guidelines will be needed to address the inﬂuence oftherapeutic hypothermia in the accurate assessment of neuro-
logic prognosis after cardiac arrest.
This review focuses on assessment of prognosis in
patients treated with hypothermia using evidence from recentlypublished reports and studies. Most studies are small, as no
Class I evidence exists for predicting poor prognosis in this
patient population. Below, the predictive ability of the clinicalexamination, SSEPs, EEG, myoclonic status epilepticus
(MSE), biomarkers, and imaging are discussed based on the
currently available data.
CLINICAL EXAMINATION
Key components of the standard clinical neurologic
examination, including the pupillary light response, cornealreﬂexes, and motor response to painful stimuli are typicallyperformed in a serial manner on patients resuscitated after a
cardiac arrest. The current AAN practice parameters state that
at 72 hours after cardiac arrest, absent pupillary responses,absent corneal reﬂexes, or absent motor responses or extensor
posturing predict poor prognosis with a high degree of
certainty in patients not treated with hypothermia.
15It should
be noted that on motor testing, no movement or extensorposturing to noxious stimulation is regarded as a poor motor
response, while ﬂexor posturing or better may be associated
with a good outcome.
Available data on patients treated with hypothermia
suggest that the clinical examination in this population may
have decreased accuracy in predicting poor prognosis. In a
study of 37 patients, 2 out of 14 patients with poor motorresponses 72 hours after cardiac arrest regained consciousness,
and both had poor motor responses until day 6.
16However,
upper cranial nerve function retained predictive value, as noneof the 6 patients with absent pupillary reactivity or absentcorneal reﬂexes at 72 hours regained consciousness.
In a study of 44 patients, no patients with an absent
pupillary light response at 72 hours regained consciousness.
6
However, 1 patient with absent corneal reﬂexes and 2 patientswith poor motor responses at 72 hours did regain conscious-
ness. In another study of 45 patients, 2 patients with an absent
pupillary response or absent corneal reﬂexes between 36 and72 hours after cardiac arrest ultimately regained consciousnessand achieved a good outcome.
17Eleven of the patients in this
study had a poor motor response at 72 hours and survived, and
4 patients achieved a good outcome.
Overall, evidence suggests that an absent motor response
at 72 hours post-arrest does not reliably predict poor prognosis
in patients who have undergone therapeutic hypothermia.However, the presence of a motor response may suggest agood outcome. In a study of 72 patients, the presence of a
motor response within 24 hours after the discontinuation of
sedation predicted a good outcome with 100% speciﬁcity.
18In
summary, the absence of brainstem reﬂexes at 72 hoursstrongly suggests a poor prognosis, but cannot be used with
absolute certainty. Future studies should be performed to
conﬁrm the absolute prognostic ability of the pupillary lightresponse and corneal reﬂex examination in patients who have
undergone therapeutic hypothermia.
SSEP
SSEPs are commonly used to assess prognosis after
cardiac arrest, and the current AAN practice parameters state
that the bilateral absence of the N20 response between 24 and72 hours after cardiac arrest can accurately predict poor pro-
gnosis in patients who have not undergone hypothermia.15,19
Additional studies in normothermic patients with SSEPs per-
formed from 4 to 24 hours after cardiac arrest found that an
absent N20 response invariably predicted poor prognosis.20,21
However, reports do exist of patients who initially have absentN20 responses who proceed to recover these responses, as well
as achieve a good recovery.
22
The cortical N20 response is measured after electrical
stimulation of the median nerve. Hypothermia affects the N20
response, as conduction velocity in the median nerve decreases
by 2 m/s for every 1 1C decrease, resulting in an increased N20
latency.23,24Below body temperatures of 30 1C, the cortical
N20 response disappears.25,26However, at temperatures of
321Ct o3 4 1C, the N20 latency may be prolonged but should
remain present.25,27Thus, the N20 response should be a
reliable ﬁnding at body temperatures of 32 1Ct o3 4 1C.
The role of SSEP for prognostication in patients under-
going hypothermia has recently been examined. An earlier
study of 3 patients with bilaterally absent N20 responses 24 to48 hours after cardiac arrest found that none of the patients
regained consciousness.
28Another study of 77 patients identi-
ﬁed 13 patients with bilaterally absent N20 responses duringhypothermia, and none regained consciousness.
29In another
study of 14 patients with an absent N20 response more than 72
hours after cardiac arrest, none regained consciousness.6A
study of 100 patients in whom the N20 response was assessedat least 24 hours after the completion of rewarming and thediscontinuation of sedation found that no patients with
bilaterally absent N20 responses survived.
17
However, the bilateral absence of an N20 response does
not appear to invariably predict poor prognosis. In a study of185 patients, 36 patients had bilaterally absent N20 responses
at 72 hours, but 1 patient did survive and ultimately achieve a
good recovery.
30Another patient had severe bilateral reduc-
tions of N20 amplitudes, but also survived and achieved
normal cognitive functioning. In both patients, the SSEP was
performed 2 days after the institution of rewarming. The avail-able data suggest that an absent N20 response after rewarmingor even during hypothermia likely predicts poor prognosis, but
owing to this isolated case of recovery, a bilaterally absent N20
response at 72 hours may not predict poor prognosis withabsolute certainty.
EEG
EEG has been used for decades to assess neurologic
prognosis. Various classiﬁcation systems and time intervals of
recording after resuscitation have confounded the utility of
EEG to accurately predict prognosis. The common backgroundEEG patterns observed after cardiac arrest (Fig. 1) includeextremely low voltage (ﬂat; maximum voltage <5 mV),
continuous, discontinuous suppression-burst (SB) pattern, or
electrographic status epilepticus (ESE) with recurrent epilepti-form activity.
In the target temperature range of 32 1Ct o3 4 1C during
hypothermia, the EEG should not be signiﬁcantly affected.
31
However, extremely low-voltage EEGs are not uncommonduring hypothermia. This may be secondary to the pharmaco-
logic effects of the benzodiazepines, opioids, and propofol
used for sedation, or owing to a decrease in the cerebral meta-bolic rate and in electrical activity overall. Hypothermia hasbeen found to be independently protective against seizures.
32
The most recent AHA guidelines recommend a “spot”
EEG as early as possible, or continuous EEG monitoring forBlondin and Greer The Neurologist /C15Volume 17, Number 5, September 2011
242 |www.theneurologist.org r2011 Lippincott Williams & Wilkinspatients treated with therapeutic hypothermia.14An EEG is es-
sential, as neuromuscular blockade will mask clinical seizures.In a study of 51 patients undergoing hypothermia, EEGdetected ESE with epileptiform activity persisting for greater
than 30 minutes in 5 patients, and none of these patients ulti-
mately regained consciousness.
33However, it should be notedthat a standard treatment of ESE was not performed in these
patients, introducing the possibility of inadequate treatment.
Several studies have examined the utility of EEG for
assessing prognosis in patients treated with hypothermia.
Continuous amplitude integrated EEG (aEEG) is a technique
that can be used to classify ongoing EEG patterns, as patterns

(A), continuous (B), discontinuous suppression-burst pattern (C), or electrographic status epilepticus with recurrent epileptiform activity

r2011 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins www.theneurologist.org |243can change during the course of hypothermia treatment. An
initial study of aEEG was carried out on 34 patients with conti-nuous EEG recordings during hypothermia.
34Two patients
were found to have an SB pattern and 1 patient had an alpha
coma pattern, and none of these 3 regained consciousness.Seven patients developed clinical seizures, correlated withESE during hypothermia, which was refractory to anticonvul-
sant therapy, and none of these patients regained conscious-
ness. All patients with an initially continuous EEG regainedconsciousness, whereas the outcome was mixed in 24 patients
who had an initially ﬂat pattern; 11 evolved to a pattern other
than continuous upon returning to normothermia, and none ofthese 11 regained consciousness.
A larger aEEG study was also undertaken on patients
undergoing therapeutic hypothermia. Monitoring was initiated
in 100 patients at a median of 8 hours after cardiac arrest.
35
During hypothermia, 14 patients had an initial SB pattern, andall ultimately died without regaining consciousness. An
initially ﬂat pattern during hypothermia was not predictive of
prognosis, whereas a continuous pattern had a positive pre-dictive value for regaining consciousness of 91%. Normother-
mia was achieved at a median of 36 hours after cardiac arrest;
7 patients had an SB pattern and 17 patients had ESE, and all24 died during the hospitalization without regaining con-sciousness. All 17 patients with ESE received standard treat-
ment with an anticonvulsant. Nine patients initially had a ﬂat
pattern, and 3 ultimately regained consciousness.
The bispectral index (BIS) is another EEG modality that
has been studied for the assessment of prognosis in patients
who have suffered cardiac arrest. BIS was originally developed
to assess depth of anesthesia during surgery.
36In a study of 45
patients, continuous BIS monitoring was performed for theinitial 72 hours after cardiac arrest.
37Fourteen patients had a
BIS score of 0 during the ﬁrst 24 hours. At 6 months, 11 of
these patients had died, 1 remained in a vegetative state, and 2had severe neurologic deﬁcits but had regained consciousness.
Thus, a BIS score of 0 does not invariably predict poor
prognosis.
Despite the ﬁndings in the studies using an aEEG, ESE
during hypothermia does not have a uniformly poor prognosis.
In a study of 110 patients, 3 had ESE during hypothermia but
ultimately recovered and achieved a good outcome after theywere aggressively treated with anticonvulsants.
16It was noted
that all 3 of these patients had reactive EEG backgrounds. In
this same study, 3 patients who were found to have no EEG
background reactivity regained consciousness but all hadsevere neurologic impairment. This suggests that EEG reacti-
vity may be helpful to assessing prognosis, and the presence of
reactivity may suggest a good outcome.
EEG should be performed as soon as possible during
hypothermia to assess for ESE and also identify the back-
ground pattern. An SB pattern during hypothermia quite
commonly heralds a poor prognosis. ESE also indicates somelikelihood of poor outcome; however, seizures should be treatedaggressively as poor outcome is not certain, and no studies have
examined the efﬁcacy of aggressive anticonvulsant medication
treatment in this population.
Case reports do exist of patients with ESE while
undergoing hypothermia who ultimately had a good outcome
after aggressive treatment of their seizures. The identiﬁcation
of a continuous EEG background during hypothermia maycorrelate with a good prognosis. Future research will need to
evaluate the role of both “spot” EEG as well as continuous
EEG monitoring before the optimal use of EEG to prognos-ticate can be determined.MYOCLONUS
Historically, MSE has been proposed as a clinical feature
strongly suggestive of poor prognosis.38,39MSE is a clinical
entity commonly observed after cardiac arrest, and variousEEG patterns may coexist such as ﬂat, SB, and ESE.
40MSE
appears clinically as spontaneous, repetitive, unrelenting,
generalized, and multifocal myoclonus involving the face,limbs, and axial musculature in the presence of coma.
14
Several case reports exist of normothermic patients with
MSE who recovered consciousness.41–44Myoclonus may be
more commonly seen in patients who suffer a primary hypoxicevent, even without a concomitant loss of perfusion, and in this
setting is often associated with a good outcome.
41,45,46
In a study of 44 patients who underwent therapeutic
hypothermia, 2 patients developed MSE within 72 hours, andneither regained consciousness.
6However, in another study of
181 patients, 3 patients who developed MSE during hypother-
mia regained consciousness.47These 3 patients had preserved
pupillary and corneal reﬂexes, intact bilateral N20 responses,and reactive EEG backgrounds, and all were treated with
benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, and propofol. Other case
reports also exist of isolated patients who developed MSEduring hypothermia and later regained consciousness withgood outcome.
16,48,49
It is important to recognize that MSE may develop during
weaning of neuromuscular blockade, as 23 out of 51 patients in1 study developed MSE at a median time of 29 hours after
cardiac arrest.
33Should MSE appear, it should be evaluated
aggressively with EEG, and anticonvulsants used to treatelectrographic seizures, as MSE does not appear to beinvariably associated with poor outcome. Furthermore, MSE
likely does not have a role as a prognostic sign in patients
treated with therapeutic hypothermia.
BIOMARKERS
In addition to the clinical examination and neurophysio-
logic tests, biochemical markers have been studied to predict
prognosis. Neuron-speciﬁc enolase (NSE) is the neuronal formof the intracytoplasmic glycolytic enzyme enolase. NSE isfound in neurons, and neuronal injury can be detected by the
presence of increased levels of NSE in the cerebrospinal ﬂuid
or blood.
50,51However, NSE is also found in platelets and red
blood cells, and hemolysis can increase serum NSE values.52
Several studies in normothermic cardiac arrest patients havedemonstrated that high serum NSE levels are associated withpoor outcome.
53–56Current guidelines state that a serum NSE
level greater than 33 mg/L between 24 and 72 hours after
cardiac arrest can accurately predict poor prognosis.14
The usefulness of NSE levels to predict prognosis in
patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia has also beenexamined. NSE levels are typically attenuated in hypothermic
patients compared with normothermic patients.
57,58Serum cut-
off values for NSE and the trend of NSE levels over time havebeen investigated. In general, treatment with hypothermia can
result in rapidly decreasing levels of serum NSE, and decreas-
ing NSE values over time have been found to be associatedwith recovery of consciousness, good neurologic outcome, anddecreased mortality.
57However, 1 study found that an increas-
ing serum NSE level between 24 and 48 hours was invariably
associated with a poor outcome.57This study found that a
serum NSE level of 31.2 mg/L at 24 hours post-arrest had a
96% speciﬁcity for predicting poor outcome, and a level of
25.0mg/L at 48 hours had a 96% speciﬁcity for predicting poor
outcome.Blondin and Greer The Neurologist /C15Volume 17, Number 5, September 2011
244 |www.theneurologist.org r2011 Lippincott Williams & WilkinsAnother study also found that a rise in serum NSE level
of >2 mg/L between 24 and 48 hours, or a serum NSE level
greater than 28 mg/L at 48 hours post-arrest, had a 100% speci-
ﬁcity for predicting no better recovery than severe neurologic
disability, but some patients did have recovery of conscious-ness.
59Oksanen et al60found that an increase in the NSE level
by 6.4 mg/L or more from 24 to 48 hours could accurately
predict an outcome of severe neurologic disability or worse,
but in their study the NSE cut-off values were higher, at 41 mg/
L at 24 hours and 33 mg/L at 48 hours. A study by Steffen
et al58found even higher cut-off values. In this study, serum
NSE was measured 72 hours after cardiac arrest, and a value of78.9mg/L was found to have 100% speciﬁcity for predicting no
better outcome than severe neurologic disability.
In patients treated with hypothermia, absolute NSE cut-
off values for the prediction of neurologic prognosis appear tobe unreliable. One study reported that 4 out of 42 patients withan NSE level greater than 33 mg/L regained consciousness and
achieved a good outcome, with 1 patient having an NSE level
of 85 mg/L.
6The serum NSE levels can be affected by time to
NSE measurement, laboratory immunoassay, hemolysis,
circumstances surrounding the cardiac arrest, and probably
hypothermia treatment itself. Although a rising NSE levelbetween 24 and 48 hours may suggest poor prognosis, theredoes not appear to be a NSE cut-off value that can be used
reliably to predict poor prognosis in patients who have
undergone therapeutic hypothermia.
IMAGING
With recent advances in imaging technology, the role of
neuroimaging to assess prognosis has been explored. Initialexperience with neuroimaging after cardiac arrest was based
on computed tomography (CT). Early CT performance can
help to rule out acute neurologic injuries, such as an intra-cranial hemorrhage, but CT performed soon after cardiac arrestis most often normal. CT ﬁndings can later evolve to demon-
strate edematous changes in brain parenchyma over the next
several days, but these changes may be of limited predictivevalue. More recent work in normothermic patients hassuggested that certain CT imaging ﬁndings, such as changes
in Hounsﬁeld units in speciﬁc brain regions, may be useful for
prognosis.
61However, in current guidelines, there continues to
be inadequate data to support CT imaging as a prognostic
tool.14
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is commonly used
after cardiac arrest, as it is more sensitive than CT inillustrating the degree of anoxic brain injury (Fig. 2). An early
study using conventional MRI after cardiac arrest found that
MRI ﬁndings were not helpful for use in prognostication.
62
However, patients underwent only T2-weighted imaging, per-formed within a range of 1 to 47 days after the cardiac arrest in
an ultra-low-ﬁeld magnet operating at 0.02 Tesla. Since the
time of that study, imaging technology has changed dramati-cally, and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) MR sequences
are now being used to detect structural neurologic abnormal-
ities after cardiac arrest.
Several studies have shown that signiﬁcant differences
exist in DWI between ischemic infarction and anoxic injury,
such as evolving regions of restricted diffusion and changing
apparent diffusion coefﬁcient (ADC) values over time.
63–67
These changes in DWI and ADC indicate that imag-ing within hours after cardiac arrest may not demonstrate the
full extent of ischemic brain injury, and ADC depression
caused by global hypoxia can be signiﬁcantly delayedcompared with that caused by focal ischemia.
68–70This may
be secondary to delayed apoptosis, or a delayed CNShypoperfusion state after resuscitation, causing secondary
ischemic injury hours to days after the cardiac arrest.
71Studies
in normothermic patients have found that patients with absentor mild DWI and ADC changes typically have a goodoutcome.
72–75
A small number of imaging studies have been performed
on patients undergoing hypothermia. In therapeutic hypother-mia, ADC values change linearly and directly with declining
brain temperatures, with an approximate 1.6% change in ADC
intensity for every 1 1C decrease in brain temperature.
76
In 1 study of 20 patients who underwent therapeutic
hypothermia, in the 4 patients who survived none had
restricted diffusion in the parietal or temporal lobes.77Another
study of 33 patients (21 of whom underwent therapeutichypothermia) who underwent MRI at a median of 88 hoursfollowing cardiac arrest found that patients in the good
outcome group with minimal or mild DWI abnormalities had a
good outcome, while those with moderate or severe abnorm-alities had a poor outcome.
70
Several quantitative measures, such as mean brain ADC
value and the percentage of brain parenchyma below certainADC value thresholds, have been examined. In a study of 80patients (14 of whom underwent therapeutic hypothermia) who
underwent MRI at a median of 2 days after cardiac arrest, no
patients with a median brain ADC value less than 665 /C210
/C06
mm2/s had recovery better than a moderate-to-severe neuro-
logic disability, although some did regain consciousness.78
In another study of 51 patients (31 of whom underwent
therapeutic hypothermia) who underwent MRI at a mean of 88hours, the ﬁnding of greater than 10% of brain volume with anADC value less than 650 /C210
/C06mm2/s between 2 and 4.5
days after the cardiac arrest was invariably associated with a
poor prognosis.79In this study, the ADC changes were variable
over time and found to only provide prognostic information
when MRI was obtained between 49 and 108 hours after
cardiac arrest. This indicates that the timing of imaging mustbe taken into account when imaging results are used to assessprognosis.
MRI does have limitations. Imaging cannot easily be
performed on patients with implanted devices, such as apacemaker or Automated Implantab le Cardioverter-Deﬁbrillator,
or other metallic objects. Historically, there has been concern
about clinically unstable patients being unable to safely
undergo MRI.
61,73Most patients can now safely undergo
MRI with portable ventilators, monitors and IV pumps that are
MRI compatible. Unless there is an unstable cardiac rhythm or
severe hemodynamic or respiratory instability, transport andacquisition of MRI can be performed safely in most cases.
The ﬁnding of a normal or near-normal MRI after cardiac
arrest should lead to continued supportive care, as these patients
may awaken with an ultimately good outcome. Conversely, thepresence of widespread diffusion-weighted abnormalities orADC depression may correlate with poor outcome, but MRI
has not yet been validated as a predictive tool. Future pro-
spective trials should further evaluate the role of neuroimagingin prognosis.
SUMMARY
Accurate prognostication after cardiac arrest is often
challenging. Neurologists are frequently consulted to provide
expertise on the chances of a meaningful recovery. Criteria for
a poor outcome should have a high degree of certainty beforeThe Neurologist /C15Volume 17, Number 5, September 2011 Prognosis in Patients Receiving Hypothermia
r2011 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins www.theneurologist.org |245being used routinely in clinical practice. With the introduction
of therapeutic hypothermia, neurologic prognosis has becomeeven more difﬁcult. On review of published data, there doesnot appear to be any single criteria that can predict no recovery
of consciousness with absolute certainty. Rather, providing
prognosis must now rest on integrating the results of severalclinical and diagnostic tests.
On the basis of review of the literature, we propose
features that may suggest poor, indeterminate, or goodprognosis in patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia(Table 1). These statements reﬂect our opinion based on the
references cited in the table, as no consensus guidelines
currently exist for individual parameters stated in the mostrecent AAN guidelines. The most recent AHA guidelines dorecommend aggressive treatment and observation for at least
72 hours post-arrest in patients treated with therapeutic
hypothermia before predicting poor outcome.
14
In our opinion, for patients who undergo hypothermia,
features that strongly suggest a poor prognosis include the
absence of a pupillary light response or corneal reﬂexes at 72
hours post-arrest, the bilateral absence of the cortical N20response, a SB EEG pattern or ESE during hypothermia, rising
NSE levels between 24 and 48 hours post-arrest, and
signiﬁcant depressions of MRI ADC values 3 days post-arrest.Features that are now considered indeterminate in patients whoundergo hypothermia include the absence of motor function on
clinical examination 72 hours post-arrest, a ﬂat EEG pattern
during hypothermia, the presence of myoclonic statusepilepticus at any time, and a serum NSE level greater than33mg/L 72 hours post-arrest.
Features that may predict a good prognosis include the
presence of a motor response of withdrawal or better within 48hours post-arrest, a continuous EEG pattern without epileptiform
activity during hypothermia, and absent or minimal abnormalities
on DWI 3 days after cardiac arrest. However, these features wereonly examined in small studies, and further investigation must beundertaken before deﬁnitiv e conclusions are drawn.It is important to remember that a common bias in trials of
prognosis after cardiac arrest is the self-fulﬁlling prophecycreated by early withdrawal of care. Over the next several
years, larger studies should be undertaken to assess the
accuracy of predictive tools speciﬁcally in the population thatundergoes therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest. These
studies should be designed with an acceptable waiting period
in cases in which the prognosis is uncertain, as delayed re-covery can occur. Furthermore, given the possibility of delayedrecovery, the time points at which the current prognostic tools
are employed may need to be adjusted.
On the basis of the review of the literature, we suggest the
following practical advice (Table 2): (1) EEG should beperformed as early as possible, preferably continuously, and
electrographic seizures (and particularly ESE) should be
treated aggressively; (2) clinical examination ﬁndings, includ-ing pupillary, corneal, and motor responses, should be applied72 hours after the patient has achieved normothermia; (3)
SSEP should be performed at 48 hours after the patient has
achieved normothermia; (4) the utility of biomarkers in thispopulation is unclear, and NSE should be assessed 48 to 72
hours after normothermia is achieved; (5) the utility of neuro-
imaging in this population is unclear, and CT for prognostica-tion should be performed 24 to 48 hours after the patient hasachieved normothermia, and MRI should be performed 3 to 5
days after the patient has achieved normothermia.
Application of the current AAN guidelines to patients
undergoing therapeutic hypothermia may lead to overlypessimistic prognostication and premature withdrawal of care.
If uncertainty exists in the prognosis in a given patient after
cardiac arrest, additional time should be allowed to pass, asclinical features may recover, neurophysiology may normalize,
and neuroimaging may show injury in a delayed fashion.
Overall, with continued widespread adoption of therapeutichypothermia after cardiac arrest, more patients will surviveresuscitation with good neurological outcomes, and thus one
should always err on the side of caution in assessing prognosis.

Perform EEG as early as possible
Treat electrographic seizures aggressivelyApply clinical examination ﬁndings 72 h after normothermia achievedPerform SSEP 48 h after normothermia achievedAssess NSE 48-72 h after normothermia achievedPerform CT 24-48 h after normothermia achieved, if above data
inconclusive
Perform MRI 3-5 days after normothermia achieved, if above data
inconclusive

Prognosis in Patients Treated With Therapeutic Hypothermia
Features that likely suggest a poor prognosis
Absence of a pupillary light response at 72 h6,16
Absence of corneal reﬂexes at 72 h17
Features that may suggest a poor prognosis
Bilateral absence of the cortical N20 response6,17,28,29
Suppression-burst EEG pattern during hypothermia34,35
Rising NSE level between 24 and 48 h post-arrest57,60
Signiﬁcant depressions of MRI ADC values at 72 h79
Features that are considered indeterminate
Absence of motor function at 72 h16
Flat EEG pattern during hypothermia34,35
Presence of myoclonic status epilepticus at any time47
NSE level greater than 33 mg/L at 72 h6,58
Features that may suggest a good prognosis
Presence of a motor response of withdrawal or better within 48 h
post-arrest18
Continuous EEG pattern without epileptiform activity during
hypothermia34,35
Absent or minimal abnormalities in ADC values at 72 h70,77
Features are the opinion of the authors, based on available data (cited). No
features appear to be able to absolutely predict a poor prognosis, and no features
have been proven to predict a good prognosis.
