Abstract 
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)  are a class of toxic, carcinogenic 
and/or mutagenic organic compounds, which must be removed from 
contaminated environments such as wa stewater. The present study aims to 
explore the potential of a fresh water green microalga, Selenastrum 
capricornutum , immobilized in alginate beads to remove mixed PAHs and 
determine the optimal density for an effective removal. Results demonstrated 
that the immobilized microalgal be ads were effective in removing and 
biodegrading mixed PAHs at their dissolved concentrations, namely 
phenanthrene (PHE, 1 mg l-1), fluoranthene (FLA, 0.25 mg l-1) and pyrene (PYR, 
0.1 mg l-1). These abilities were significantly affected by cell density, ranging 
from 2.5x105 to 5x106 cells bead-1. At the optimal cell density of 2.5x106 cells 
bead-1, 92% PHE and all FLA were removed in 168 hours, and it only took 24 
hours to completely remove PYR. In 168-hour treatment, 73% PHE was 
biodegraded while FLA and PYR were completely degraded. The removal and 
biodegradation of PAHs were further enhanced by increasing the number of 
beads used and the optimal bead density was 20 beads ml-1 wastewater. These 
findings suggested that PAHs were quickly adsorbed onto cells and the alginate 
matrix, absorbed within cells and further degraded by live cells immobilized in 
alginate beads.

doi:10.2495/ 01WM 10351 Introduction 
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (P AHs), a large class of persistent, 
carcinogenic and/or mutagenic organic compounds consisting of two or more 
fused aromatic rings in a linear, angular or cluster structure, are generated from 
both natural and anthropogenic sources. With increasing human activities, PAHs 
have been widely contaminating our en vironment and have attracted increasing 
concern. Bioremediation by bacteria and fungi has been suggested as an 
alternative means to remove PAHs [1]. Relatively little work has been done on 
PAH removal by microalgae, although this microbial group has been reported to 
be effective in removing toxic metals and other organic pollutants, such as 
tributyltin [2-4]. One of the major problems of employing microorganisms, 
including microalgae, to remove pollutants from wastewater is the difficulty in 
separating them after treatment. Immobilization techniques by embedding 
microbial cells into a matrix to make big particles could solve the harvesting 
problem. Matrices, such as alginate, k-carrageenan, agarose, chitosan, 
polyacrylamide, etc., have been suggested [5-7]. Among these, alginate has been 
very popular and is a commonly used matrix because of its reliability, stability 
and simplicity of preparation, and relatively non-toxic to microorganisms. 
Growth of C. vulgaris  immobilized in alginate was not  affected and its efficiency 
to remove nitrogen and phosphorus was even higher than the free cell 
counterpart [6 ]. Travieso et al. [7] reported that the orig inal shape and structure 
of alginate pellets of C. vulgaris , C. kessleri  and Scenedesmus quadricauda  were 
still maintained, but the k-carrageenan pellets of S. quadricauda  disintegrated 
with cell leaking during the ten-day nutrient removal experiment. The alginate 
immobilized C. vulgaris  could remove and regenerate nickel for at least ten 
cycles without losing any removal capacity , indicating the superior stability of 
alginate [8].  
     The performance of immobilized microalgae in removing contaminants is 
affected by the cell density embedded within the matrix, and the number of 
beads employed for treatment, that is, bead density. Pradhan and Rai [9] reported 
that the removal percentages of  copper(II) by a cyanobacterium, Microcystis  sp., 
immobilized in alginate increased when biomass increased from 0.016 to 0.064 g 
but further increase of the biomass did not enhance the removal percentages. 
Similar to free cells, a higher biomass would provide more cell surface, volume 
and enzymes for adsorption, absorption and degradation of the contaminant. 
However, competition of resources, such as nutrients and light, self-shading and 
limitation in the mass transfer of contaminants, will occur when the cell density 
is too high [10]. Tam and Wong [11] found that the optimal bead density for the 
removal of ammonium and phosphate from wastewater by alginate immobilized 
C. vulgaris  was 12 beads ml-1. Although alginate immobilized microalgae have 
been optimized for the removal of nutrients and heavy metals from wastewater 
[5-8, 11, 12], knowledge on treating PAH-contaminated wastewater using 
immobilized microalgae is very limited. The present study aims to determine the 
optimal initial cell density inside each bead, as well as the bead density, on the 
removal and degradation of a mixture of phenanthrene (PHE), fluoranthene 392  Waste Management and the Environment V

capricornutum  was chosen as a model microalgal species because of its 
ubiquitous occurrence and ease of cultivation. The free cells of S. capricornutum 
were also found to have a higher ability to degrade PAHs than other green 
microalgae, such as Chlorella  [13, 14].  
2 Materials and methods 
2.1 Preparation of immobilized beads 
The fresh water unicellular microalga, Selenastrum capricornutum , was 
purchased from Carolina Biological Supply Company (USA). Cells cultured in 
modified SE medium under axenic condition were harvested after 10-12 days 
[15]. The algal suspension was mixed with heat-dissolved sodium alginate to 
form 3% algal alginate mixture, dropped into 2.5% calcium chloride solution by 
a peristaltic pump (Cole-Parmer Instrumental Company Masterflex L/S model 
7519-06) to produce immobilized algal beads, each with a diameter of 3 mm. 
Blank beads were prepared in the same  way with sterilized de-ionized water 
instead of cell suspension.  
2.2 Effects of initial cell densit ies per bead on PAH removal 
A total of 90 sterilized conical flasks (250  ml), each with a stopper consisting of 
a cotton wool plug wrapped by aluminium foil containing 100 ml SE medium 
dissolved with 1 mg L-1P H E ,  0 . 2 5  m g  L-1 FLA and 0.1 mg L-1 PYR, were 
prepared. Microalgal beads at initial cell densities of 0 (without cells, blank bead 
control), 2.5x105, 1.25x106, 2.5x106 and 5x106 cells bead-1 were examined. 400 
alginate-immobilized microalgal beads we re inoculated to each of the flasks 
(equivalent to the bead density of 4 beads ml-1). The flasks were shaken at 150 
rpm and were illuminated by cool fluorescent light (50 E s-1) with a 16/8 hour 
light/dark cycle. At 1, 24, 48, 72, 96, an d 168 hours, triplicate flasks from each 
treatment were retrieved. The beads, after separated from the medium, were 
dissolved by 80 ml sodium citrate (0.2 M). The dissolved alginate matrix was 
separated from the cells by centrifugation at 2,400 g for 15 min. The PAH 
concentrations in the medium, in alginate matrix and taken up by cells were 
extracted by ethyl acetate following the st andard method [15], and determined by 
a Hewlett Packard 5890 gas chromatogr aphy (GC) equipped with a flame 
ionization detector (FID). The fused ca pillary column (J & W Scientific HP-
5MS) was 30 m long with 0.25 mm internal diameter and was coated with 
methyl silicone of 0.25 µm film th ickness. The temperature program was 
maintained at 120°C for 1 min, increased to 214°C at a rate of 2.5°C min-1, then 
to 222°C at a rate of 1°C min-1 and maintained at 222°C for 1 min. The injector 
and detector temperatures were 280°C (splitless for 1.5 min) and 300°C, 
respectively. The carrier gas was helium.  
     The PAH removal percentage was calculated by: (Amount of PAH added – 
Amount remained in the medium) / Amount of PAH added x 100%. The PAH Waste Management and the Environment V  393
 
 www.witpress.com, ISSN 1743-3541 (on-line) WIT Transactions on Ecology and the Environment, Vol 1,©2010 WIT Press 40degradation percentage was calculated: (Amount of PAH added – Amount of 
PAH remained in medium – Amount of PAH adsorbed on alginate matrix – 
Amount of PAH taken by cells) / Amount of PAH added x 100%. 
2.3 Effect of a different number of microalgal beads on PAH removal 
The same experimental set-up was used to determine the effect of bead density. 
The number of beads applied to each flask was 12, 20 and 40 beads ml-1 with 
bead-to-medium volume ratios of 0.9:5, 1.5:5 and 3:5, respectively. Only one 
initial cell density, 2.5x106 cells bead-1, was used. Triplicate flasks from each 
treatment were retrieved at regular time interval to determine the removal and 
degradation of PAHs as described above.  
3 Results 
3.1 Effects of cell density per microalgal bead on PAH removal 
The removal of all three PAHs increased significantly from blank beads (no 
microalgae) to microalgal beads of high er initial cell densities (Figure 1). In the 
first hour of treatment, the density of 2.5x106 cells bead-1 had the highest PHE 
removal (61%) when compared to the other densities. From 24 hours onwards, 
the removal percentages at the two highest densities (2.5x106 and 5x106 cells 
bead-1) were comparable, increased from 80% in 24-hour to 92% PHE removal 
in 168-hour treatment. At the lowest density, 2.5x105 cells bead-1, the removal 
percentages increased from 42% in 1-hour to 56% in 24-hour, and only 60% 
PHE was removed at the end of the experiment (164-hour). Similar removal 
patterns were observed for FLA and PYR but with different amplitudes. Same as 
PHE removal, the initial density of 2.5x106 cells bead-1 had the highest FLA 
removal (70%) in the first hour, the removal then increased to 90% in 24-hour 
and there was no significant difference between this density and the highest one 
(5x106 cells bead-1) from there onwards. At the lowest density, 2.5x105 cells 
bead-1, only 76% FLA was removed in 24 hours. After 168 hours, FLA was 
completely removed by beads at the two highest densities while 95 and 83% 
FLA removal were achieved by beads at 1.25x106 and 2.5x105 cells bead-1, 
respectively. For the removal of PYR, 2.5x106 cells bead-1 treatment had 73% 
removal in the first hour while its initial removal at the other cell densities was 
lower, ranging from 50 to 55%. All PYR was removed by immobilized 
microalgae at the three highest densities in 24 hours. At the lowest density 
(2.5x105 cells bead-1), PYR removal was 78% in 24 hours and increased to 85% 
in 168 hours (Figure 1). 
3.2 Effects of cell density per microalgal bead on degradation of PAHs 
The effects of cell density on PAH degradation by immobilized S. 
capricornutum  (Figure 2) was very different from that of PAH removal  
(Figure 1). The percentages of PHE, FLA and PYR degraded by blank beads

(Figure 2), indicating that degradation without algae was minimal. For the 
microalgal beads, the percentages of PAH degradation increased significantly 
with treatment time and th e effects of cell density were PAH-dependent. At the 
end of 168 hours, PHE degradation increased  with cell densities, from 14% at the 
lowest density to 55% at the second lowest density, and the two highest densities 
had comparably high degradation percentages (>65%). Similarly, the lowest 
density (2.5x105 cells bead-1) only achieved 1% FLA degradation, while FLA 
was completely degraded at 2.5x106 cells bead-1 in 168 hours. All PYR was also 
degraded by immobilized beads at the two highest densities (2.5x106 and 5x106 
cells bead-1) in 168 hours, while only 12% PYR was degraded at the lowest cell 
density. The small degradation found at the lowest initial cell density suggested 
that a certain number of cells were need ed for an efficient degradation of PAHs. 
It is clear that the seco nd highest density (2.5x106 cells bead-1) not only had the 
best removal, it also achieved the best degradation percentages for PHE, FLA 
and PYR, and was the optimal cell density for the removal and degradation of 
mixed PAHs. 
3.3 Effects of bead density on the removal and biodegradation of PAHs 
When compared to the PAH removal by the immobilized S. capricornutum  at a 
bead density of 4 beads ml-1 (Figure 1), initial removal of PAHs, as well as the 
removal efficiency, were significantly enhanced at high bead densities (Figure 
3). The removal also increased gradua lly with time and reached the maximum 
removal within 6 to 12 hours, depending on the bead density and the types of 
PAH. For PHE removal, the bead density at 12 beads ml-1 could remove 79% 
PHE in the first hour while 84% PHE was removed at the two highest bead 
densities, 20 and 40 beads ml-1. In 96-hour treatment, PHE was completely 
removed at 20 beads ml-1 while the removal at 12 and 40 beads ml-1 was 96 and 
99%, respectively. These PHE removal per centages were much higher than that 
at 4 beads ml-1 (Figure 1). Similarly, almost 168 hours were needed for complete 
removal of FLA when the bead density was only 4 beads ml-1(Figure 1), but FLA 
was completely removed in 24 hours at a bead density of 12 beads ml-1 and the 
time reduced to 6 hours at a higher bead density (20 and 40 beads ml-1). In the 
first hour, PYR was completely removed at 20 beads ml-1, while it took 6 hours 
to remove all PYR at bead densities of 12 and 40 beads ml-1 (Figure 3). 
     PAH degradation by immobilized S. capricornutum  at high bead densities 
increased significantly when compared to that at the lo w bead density of 4 beads 
ml-1 (Figures 1 and 4). The degradation of PAHs by immobilized S. 
capricornutum  increased with time (Figure 4) . For PHE degradation, the 12 
beads ml-1 treatment was higher than that at 20 beads ml-1. However, the reverse 
was found for FLA and PYR with more degradation at a bead density of 20 
beads ml-1. In 96-hour treatment, FLA was comp letely degraded at 20 beads ml-1 
while only 88% FLA degradation was recorded in the 12 beads ml-1 treatment. 
All PYR was degraded in 48 hours at 20 beads ml-1 but it took 96 hours when the 
bead density decreased to 12 beads ml-1 (Figure 4) and almost 168 hours at the

4 Discussion 
A mixture of PAHs, including PHE, FLA and PYR, were successfully removed 
and biodegraded by alginate-immobilized S. capricornutum  in the present study. 
PAHs in the medium were quickly adsorbed onto alginate matrix and cell 
surfaces, passed through cell walls and cell membranes, accumulated inside cells 
and gradually degraded by live cells immobilized in alginate beads. Lee et al . 
[16] found that both alginate-immobilized and free cells of a mixture of bacteria 
could efficiently biodegrade phenol at low concentrations but only immobilized 
cells could maintain their degradation effi ciency at a phenol concentration of 300 
mg l-1. The nickel(II) biosorption capacity of C. sorokiniana  was increased by 
25.3% after loofa sponge immobilization [17]. However, the effects of 
immobilization on the removal and degradation of pollutants by microorganisms 
are not always positive. A microalga, Prototheca zopfii , was found to be less 
efficient in degrading n-alkanes (C 14 to C 16) after polyurethane foam 
immobilization and complete degradation of hydrocarbons by the microalgae 
was delayed from 210 to 290 hours after immobilization [18].  
     The removal efficiency of immobili zed beads, same as free cells, was related 
to the amounts of biomass used.  Macfie et al . [19] reported that higher cell 
density or biomass provided more su rface area and cell volume for adsorption 
and absorption of pollutants leading to a better removal at a shorter period of 
time. Pradhan and Rai [9] also showed that the removal of copper(II) by 
alginate-immobilized Microcystis  increased with increasing biomass up to 0.064 
g but further increase from 0.064 to 0.128 g did not enhance removal 
percentages. The removal and degradation of PAHs by immobilized S. 
capricornutum  in this study was found to increase with initial cell density per 
bead, from 2.5x105 to 2.5x106 cells bead-1, but a further enhancement effect was 
not observed at the highest initial cell density (5x106 cells bead-1). The cells 
entrapped in immobilizati on matrix would compete fo r space, nutrients, carbon 
dioxide and light supply, similar to or even more severely than that in free cells, 
especially when the cell density became very high [10]. The mass transfer of 
nutrients to the cells inside the immobilized bead was also limited.  
     Another possible mean to enhance the removal and degradation of 
contaminants by immobilized microorganisms is to increase bead density 
(number of beads used). The removal of ammonium by alginate-immobilized C. 
vulgaris  at 8 and 12 beads ml-1 were significantly higher than that at other 
densities, 4, 16 and 20 beads ml-1, while the phosphate removal was not affected 
by bead density [11]. Dense microalgal beads would limit the light penetration 
and enhance the self-shading problem among beads which in turn reduced cell 
growth and metabolic activities [20]. Self-shading might also affect the mass
