This work aimed to investigate the use of revolving algal biofilm (RAB) reactors as a sustainable and environmental friendly method to remove TDS from industrial effluents and munici-pal wastewaters. The wastewaters contained chloride, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and sulfate as the major components. The RAB reactors fed with syn-thetic industrial effluent with high TDS level demonstrated the best algal growth, with the highest TDS removal efficiency (27%) and removal rate (2,783 mg/L-day and 19,530 mg/m2-day). A suspended algal culture system only removed 3% TDS from the same wastewater. The TDS removal by the RAB reactors was considered due to several mechanisms such as absorption by the algae cells, adsorption by extracellular polymeric substance of the biofilm, and/or precipitation. Collectively, this research shows that the RAB reactors can serve as an efficient system in wastewater remedia-tion for TDS removal. © 2019 Water Environment Federation• Practitioner points• Total dissolved solids (TDS) in wastewater are pollutants of concern.• The RAB reactors can remove TDS from various types of wastewater.• The RAB reactors removed TDS by adsorbing ions elements such as Cl, Na, K, Ca, Mg, and S.• The algal biomass absorbs ions through extracellular polymeric substance.• Key wordschloride; extracellular polymeric substance; revolving algal biofilm; total dissolved solidsIntroductionTotal dissolved solids (TDS) are generally comprised of inorganic salts (such as chlo-ride, calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, bicarbonates, and sulfates) and organic matters dissolved in water (Zhang, Zhang, Huang, & Gao, 2017). Natural waterbodies commonly contain a certain level of TDS, but human activities such as agriculture, water use, urbanization, de-icing salt applications, and mining can significantly exac-erbate the TDS level in surface and ground waters (Canedo-Arguelles et al., 2013; Steele & Aitkenhead-Peterson, 2011). This excess TDS can be toxic to many aquatic life such as fish, insects, amphibians, and macro-invertebrates. For example, TDS level above 250  mg/L can affect salmonid fertilization (Brix, Gerdesa, Curryc, Kaspera, & Grosella, 2010); increasing TDS from 270 to 1,170  mg/L can eliminate almost all coontail (Ceratophyllus demersum) and cattails (Typha sp.) from the ecosystem (Weber-Scannell & Duffy, 2007). Chapman, Bailey, and Canaria (2000) reported the chronic toxic effects such as reduced growth or survival in the chironomid larvae when TDS is over 1,100 mg/L. TDS-related acute toxicity was also reported to the water flea Ceriodaphnia dubia and the fish Pimephales promelas, and as a matter of 
Water Environment Research • 92: 766–778, 2020 767RESEARCH ARTICLEfact, these two aquatic animals have been used as test organism for TDS-related toxicity (Kennedy, Cherry, & Currie, 2003).In the United States, TDS discharge limit for wastewater has been increasingly implemented at State levels (Pinto et al., 2016). For example, the State of Ohio has an average TDS limit of 1,500 mg/L to protect aquatic life, and 500 mg/L (average) and 750 mg/L (maximum) for public water supply as a protec-tion of human health. In Iowa, chloride is used as the indicator to regulate TDS level with a standard of 250 mg/L of chloride in drinking water (Iowa DNR, 2009). In addition to municipal water, industrial effluents with high TDS level are also facing challenges of meeting TDS discharge limit before discharging into local municipal water resource recovery facilities under the US EPA pretreatment rules (USEPA, 2011).Various methods such as physical adsorption, reverse osmosis (RO), distillation, precipitation, membrane filtration, and bacteria-based bioremediation have been developed to reduce/remove TDS from water streams (Pinto et al., 2016). Most of those methods, however, are not cost-effective and/or environmental friendly. For example, physical adsorption can only remove ions from water at certain capacity before the adsorbent reaches saturation and needs to be regenerated. RO is not economical and requires high energy with the issue of filter fouling and brine disposal. Distillation produces low con-ductivity water but the process is very energy-intensive due to a large amount of latent heat required. Biological absorption avoids the addition of chemicals but the process is often limited by the low rate of absorption by microbial cells.Compared to the existing methods, biological absorption by microalgae is a mild and environmental friendly method for TDS removal. Algal cells absorb TDS species as nutrients and minerals to support their physiology and metabolisms while reducing TDS in water (Cho, Luong, Lee, Oh, & Lee, 2011; Khan, Shamshad, Waqas, Nawab, & Ming, 2017; Krishnamoorthy, Manickam, & Muthukaruppan, 2019; Lutzu & Dunford, 2019; Renuka, Sood, Ratha, Prasanna, & Ahluwalia, 2013; Sydney et al., 2011; Zhou, Li, et al., 2012). A consortium of filamentous algae was reported to reduce TDS of sewage water from 1,120 to 806  mg/L over 6  days (Renuka, Sood, Ratha, Prasanna, & Ahluwalia, 2013). An isolated alga Leptolyngbya sp. JPMTW1 reduced TDS from 490 to 427 mg/L with 7 days (Maity et al., 2014). Khan et al. (2017) reported 79% TDS removal from industrial wastewater within 12  days. In oil and gas produc-tion wastewater treatment, algae can remove up to 65% TDS over 30 days (Lutzu & Dunford, 2019). Krishnamoorthy et al. (2019) used blue-green algae to treat distiller wastewater with 64%–80% TDS removal over 7 days.In addition to TDS removal, the biomass produced from the algal reactors can be used for various applications such as fertilizer, bio-based chemicals, and biofuel production. For example, algal biomass produced from open pond (Kumar, Prajapati, Malik, & Vijay, 2017) or biofilm reactor (Choudhary, Prajapati, Kumar, Malik, & Pant, 2017) has been used for energy recovery through anaerobic digestion.Although microalgae have been identified as a promis-ing candidate for TDS removal, developing a cost-effective algal culture system is still challenging. The conventional algae cultivation systems such as open ponds or enclosed photobio-reactors typically result in very low cell densities (e.g., 0.05 wt% in open ponds and 0.1–0.5 wt% in photobioreactors). To har-vest algal cells from these systems, the cell suspension is usually concentrated through sedimentation followed with centrifuga-tion, which usually results in 20%–25% of total operation costs (Davis, Aden, & Pienkos, 2011). To overcome the high biomass harvest cost, an attachment-based algal culture system, revolv-ing algal biofilm (RAB) reactor, has been developed (Gross, Henry, Michael, & Wen, 2013; Gross, Mascarenhas, & Wen, 2015; Gross & Wen, 2018; Gross, Zhao, Mascarenhas, & Wen, 2016). In the RAB system, algal cells grow in an attachment material (“belt”), which rotates through the liquid medium to absorb nutrients, then rotates out of the water to facilitate light exposure, and gas (CO2 and O2) exchanges. Algal biofilm bio-mass can be harvested in situ by scraping, which significantly reduces the biomass harvesting cost. In addition, the vertical configuration of the revolving belt allows for greater surface area exposure to sunlight in a much smaller footprint compared to an open raceway pond. The RAB system increases the algae retention time by retaining the biomass on the attachment sur-face without being flushed out of the reactor. The algal cells on the biofilm can directly utilize CO2 from the gas phase, avoiding the barrier of CO2 gas–liquid transfer in suspended cultures.From a TDS removal perspective, RAB reactors can also be effective to removing ions and dissolved organic compounds from wastewater. Algal biofilm contains extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), a 3-D polymer network to facilitate algal cells to adhere on the belt and interact with each other (Xiao & Zheng, 2016). In particular, the negatively charged functional groups (such as carboxyl, hydroxyl, and phosphoric groups) in the EPS can adsorb various salts and organic matters (Delattre, Pierre, Laroche, & Michaud, 2016; Sheng, Yu, & Li, 2010). This physically based adsorption, together with the biological assim-ilation by the biofilm cells, enables the RAB system to remove a wide spectrum of dissolve solids from wastewater. The aim of this work is to evaluate the TDS removal performance of the RAB systems. Wastewaters containing different types and strength of TDS were evaluated. The algal biomass and EPS compositions were also determined to provide an insight into the TDS removal mechanisms by the type of reactor.Materials and MethodsWastewater streamsWastewaters representing typical industrial effluents and municipal wastewater were used. These wastewaters include (a) synthetic industrial effluent with low TDS strength (indus-trial WW–low TDS), (b) synthetic industrial effluent with high TDS strength (industrial WW–high TDS), (c) municipal waste-water (raw wastewater after coarse solids being screened out but before entering the 1st sedimentation basin) from Ames Water Pollution Control Plant in Ames, Iowa USA (Ames WW), and (d) Ames WW supplemented with 1,000 mg/L of sodium chloride (Ames WW  +  NaCl). The compositions of those wastewaters and preparation methods are provided in Table 1. The industrial WW with high/low TDS was used to 768 Peng et al.RESEARCH ARTICLE
mimic the typical industrial effluents in Chicago area. The salt concentration in these effluents was prepared based on data commonly recorded by the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District (MWRD) of Greater Chicago. The Ames WW + NaCl was mimicking municipal wastewater with high salt content resulted from de-icing road salt use in winter. There will be cer-tain bacterial growth (so as the bacteria-based TDS removal) due to the organic compounds it contained. Table 1 also shows that the pH of the wastewaters was within alkaline range from 7.9 to 9.8.Microalgal seed culturesThe microalgal seed culture (0.5–1 g/L, dry basis) was main-tained at a raceway pond (1,000 L working volume) at the Algal Production Facility at Iowa State University in Boone, IA, USA. The culture has been maintained using Bold’s Basal Medium (BBM) (Orosa, Torres, Fidalgo, & Abalede, 2000) with half of the raceway pond culture being exchanged with fresh medium every 7 days. The pond has been operated for four years, and a stable algal population mainly containing green algae and cyanobacteria species has been established.RAB system design and operationThe detailed RAB system design has been described in our previous publications (Gross et al., 2013, 2015; Gross & Wen, 2018). In brief, a flexible cotton duct canvas belt was stretched around drive shafts to form a vertical configuration. The lower region (~10%) of the belt was submerged in a liquid reservoir (1.2-L working volume) to supply nutrients, while the rest of the belt was exposed to the air to access light irradiation. The shafts were driven by a motor at speed of 4 cm/s to rotate the belt between the liquid and gas phases. To initiate cell attach-ment on the RAB belt, the liquid reservoir was inoculated with the algal seed culture and the RAB belt was rotated under continuous illumination of 110–120 µmol photons m−2 s−1 at 25°C. The suspended algal cells gradually attached on the RAB belt over a period of 2–3  weeks, during which the reservoir was supplemented with additional seed culture to compensate for water evaporative loss. After initial attachment, the algal biomass was harvested by scraping and the residual colonies remained on the material served as inoculum for the next growth cycle. During both the initial biofilm establishment stage and continuous culture stage, the biofilm was not thick enough to block the inner layer and no major “slough off” hap-pened for the biofilm. However, there were still a small portion of suspended cells in the reservoir (<0.1 g/L).Each wastewater stream was used as the influent to feed the RAB liquid reservoir, with the equal volume of the efflu-ent being discharged. The effluent discharge/influent feeding was operated on daily basis at a rate of 1.2- and 0.4-L/day. Considering the reservoir volume of 1.2-L, these two feeding rates corresponded to 1 and 3 days of hydraulic retention time (HRT), respectively. These two HRT levels were commonly reported in previous report and can be potentially adopted by MWRD in their water resource recovery facility (Zhao, Kumar, Gross, Kunetz, & Wen, 2018). A sample of effluent (~25  ml) was used for subsequent analysis. The sample was centrifuged at 1,859 g at 4°C for 5  min to remove the solid residual (the suspended algal cells); it should be noted that the solid resi-dues may contain precipitated salts. The supernatant was Table 1.

The remaining supernatant was stored at −20°C for further analyzing salt concentrations. The biomass was harvested by scraping the biofilm from the RAB belt every 6 days. The har-vested biomass was rinsed three times with distilled water and centrifuged at 1,859 g to remove the salts precipitated on the biofilm. The cell pellets were then freeze-dried to determine the cell dry weight and then stored for further analysis of ash and ions contents.The algal growth in RAB reactors was evaluated using the biomass productivity based on both volume of the liquid res-ervoir (Pvolume-RAB) and surface of the belt (Psurface-RAB), that is,
where W is the dry weight (mg) of biomass harvested from the RAB belt, V is the volume of the liquid reservoir (1.2-L), A is the surface area of the attachment belt (0.171 m2), and F is the frequency of harvesting biomass (6 days).Bubble column design and operationBubble column (BC) reactor was also used in this work. As bubble column reactor is a typical suspension-based algal cul-ture system, the TDS removal performance from this reactor will provide a comparison baseline to the biofilm-based RAB system. The BC reactors were made from Pyrex glass with an inner diameter of 6.5 cm and a height of 50 cm. Each column had a working volume of 1.2-L. The reactor was inoculated with 1.2-L seed cultures.Unlike RAB reactor, the HRT of BC was only set at 3 days, that is, 400 ml of effluent was discharged from the reactor and same amount of influent was fed on daily basis. HRT = 1 day was not used for BC reactor as cell washout will happen at this HRT level. To establish the steady state of continuous culture in BC reactor, BBM was first used as influent to the reactor in the first 6 days; then, the feeding influents were switched to the dif-ferent wastewaters as described in earlier. During the continu-ous operation, the samples of effluent discharged from the BCs were centrifuged to separate cell suspension into supernatant and biomass pellets. The supernatant was stored for analysis of TDS, chloride, and salt concentrations. The cell pellet was rinsed with distilled water and centrifuged at 1,859 g to remove the salts attached on the biofilm. This rinse step was repeated three times. The cell pellets were then freeze-dried to deter-mine the cell dry weight and then stored for further analysis of ash and ion contents. The BCs were aerated with air at 1.0 L/min under continuous illumination of 110–120 µ m−2 s−1 light intensity at 25°C.The volumetric biomass productivity in BCs (PBC) was determined as follows:where C is the biomass concentration (mg/L, dry basis), and HRT is set at 3 days. The productivity based on both ash-con-taining and ash-free biomass was determined.Determination of TDS, chloride, and other ion concentrations in liquidTotal dissolved solids and chloride concentrations were determined by Multi-Parameter PCSTesr 35 (Oakton, CA, USA) and Chloride Test Kits (Hach, CO, USA), respec-tively. The concentrations of the sodium, potassium, cal-cium, magnesium, and sulfur were determined by an iCAP 7400 inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrom-etry (ICP-OES; Thermo Scientific) with the program Qtegra (Version 2.7.2425.65; Thermo Scientific). Nitric acid (2%) was used as rinse solution. Yttrium ICP standard (5 ppm) and IV-ICPMS-71A (Inorganic, USA) were used as the internal standard and elemental standards, respectively. The wave-length for sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and sulfur was 589, 766, 315, 279, and 180 nm, respectively. The wave-length was chosen based on EPA-METHOD 6010 C and the elemental standards.Determination of ash and ion contents in biomassThe ash content of biomass was determined by heating the biomass at 550°C for 6  hr. To analyze the contents of vari-ous elements, 5 ml nitric acid was used to digest about 20 mg dry biomass in an Anton-Paar Multiwave GO system with a 30-min-long microwave program (10-min ramp to reach a power of 1,200 W, followed with 10 min at 1,200 W and 180°C and then 10-min cooling). Digested samples were diluted with deionized water into 50 ml, which were then analyzed for ele-mental composition using ICP-OES as described earlier. The biomass contents of these elements were calculated based on the element concentrations in the digested liquid and the bio-mass dry weight.Determination of EPS compositions in algal biomassThe biomass harvested from the RAB and BC reactors were treated with sonication to extract EPS (Wang, Kuo-Dahab, Dolan, & Park, 2014). In brief, the cell pellet was suspended in 20 ml of phosphate buffer solution (10 mM NaCl, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, and 6 mM Na2HPO4) at a concentration equivalent to 1  g/L (dry basis). The cell pellet solution was placed in an ice bath, and EPS was extracted with a Model 500 Sonic Dismembrator (Fisher Scientific, USA) at 40% sonication intensity (20  kHZ) for 2  min. After treatment, the micro-scopic observation showed that algal cells remained intact, indicating no major cell lysis by the given condition of soni-cation. The samples were then centrifuged at 9,418 g for 15 min, and the supernatant containing EPS was collected. The protein and polysaccharide concentrations in the super-natant solution were determined based on the Coomassie blue method (Bradford, 1976) and colorimetric method (Dubois, Gilles, Hamilton, Rebers, & Smith, 1956), respec-tively. These concentrations (mg/L) were then converted into the EPS content of the protein and the polysaccharide (mg/g dry biomass) based on the volume of the supernatant (1)Pvolume−RAB=WV,(2)Psurface−RAB=WA×F,
(3)Pvolume−BC=CHRT.770 Peng et al.RESEARCH ARTICLE
and the equivalent biomass dry weight. Total EPS content was determined by combining the protein and polysaccha-ride contents.Statistical analysisThe significance of differences among mean values was determined using analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA), followed by Tukey’s multiple range test. A significance level of p < 0.05 was considered significant. For each experimental condition, three replicates were performed. Data were pre-sented as the mean values with standard deviations of the three replicates.Results and DiscussionMicroalgal growth and EPS content in RAB and bubble column reactorsThe algal growth in RAB and bubble column (BC) reactors was evaluated based on the biomass productivity as described in Equations 1–3, respectively. As shown in Table 2, for each type of wastewater stream, the volumetric (ash-containing) biomass productivity (Pvolume) of RAB and BC was within a similar range. Between the two HRT levels of the RAB reac-tor, the surface-based (ash-containing) biomass productivity did not vary significantly (p  >  0.05). Among four different wastewaters, industrial WW–high TDS resulted in 3–5 times higher (ash-containing) biomass productivity than those fed with other types of wastewaters. Adding sodium chlo-ride (NaCl) to the real wastewater (Ames WW) at the level of 1 g/L did not have a significant (p > 0.05) impact on the cell growth, indicating the tolerance of algae at this level of salinity.Table 2 also shows that for both RAB and BC cultures, the ash content of the biomass derived from the industrial WW–high TDS was the highest level due to the high salt concentra-tion in this type of wastewater. For the ash-free biomass, the industrial WW–high TDS still resulted in the 1–2 times higher biomass productivities than the other three types of wastewa-ters although this difference was as drastic as the ash-contain-ing biomass.The above trends of cell growth were probably due to the different nutrient levels provided by the wastewater. It was found that the effluent nitrogen of the RAB reactors during the continuous operation reached to almost zero (<0.1 mg/L). Considering the nitrogen profile for the four types of wastewa-ter (Table 1), it indicates the RAB reactor fed with industrial WW-high TDS consumed the most nitrogen, while the other three wastewater streams had similar nitrogen levels. This nitrogen consumption correlated well with the cell growth of these four reactors (Table 2).In addition to cell growth, the algal biomass was further characterized for the EPS content. In algal reactor, particularly the biofilm systems, microalgae cells excrete EPS into their immediate environment to form a hydrated biofilm matrix (Gross et al., 2016), which was believed to help to adsorb TDS from wastewater. As shown in Figure 1, throughout all the biomass samples the polysaccharide content was much higher than the proteins. The EPS protein contents in RAB and BC biomass were similar, while the EPS polysaccharide was higher in RAB-derived biomass than those in BC biomass, and as a result, RAB biomass contained a higher total EPS than the BC Table 2.

biomass. Between the two HRT levels in the RAB reactors, the 3-day HRT resulted in a higher EPS polysaccharide than the 1-day HRT (Figure 1).Polysaccharides and proteins are two major components in algal EPS (Xiao & Zheng, 2016). Polysaccharide protects cells from unfavorable stress and is involved in cell-to-cell interactions, adhesion, and biofilm formation (Liu, Pohnert, & Wei, 2016). In the present study, the accumulation of EPS polysaccharide was much higher than the EPS proteins in all algal biomass. This was probably due to the nitrogen deficiency in the wastewater leading Figure 1. The contents of polysaccharide and protein in EPS of algal biomass (ash-free dry weight, AFDW) produced from RAB at 1-day HRT (RAB-1), RAB at 3-day HRT (RAB-3), and bubble column at 3-day HRT (BC-3). The influents feeding to the reactors were WW–low TDS (a); industrial WW–high TDS (b); Ames WW (c); and Ames WW + NaCl (d).

The polysaccharide accumulation also depends on the cell growth. A higher biomass productivity in the RAB sys-tems resulted in a higher polysaccharide level compare to the BC system. The longer HRT also resulted in a better cell growth and thus a higher EPS polysaccharide level.TDS removal performanceThe TDS concentrations in the effluent of RAB and BC reactors were monitored during the entire operation period. Figure 2 shows the TDS concentrations in influent and effluent of RAB and BC reactors at 3-day HRT. For each type of wastewater, the influent TDS of the RAB and BC reactors was maintained at a constant level. The effluent TDS increased initially and reached the steady state with the culture progressing. It should be noted that at the first 8–10 days, the low levels of TDS in the reactor effluents was mainly caused by the “dilution” effect, that is, the influent TDS was diluted by the BBM medium that was used for the initial cell growth. During this period (8–10 days), the cells were still in the transitional stage. With the continuous culture progressing, the reactors gradually reached equilibrium and the effluent TDS reached to steady-state concentration. These steady-state concentrations were the “true” concentra-tions reflecting the TDS removal capacity by the algal reactors (Figure 2).Based on the steady-state TDS concentrations, a compre-hensive summary of the TDS removal performance in RAB and BC reactors is presented (Table 3). Overall, TDS removal effi-ciency (TDS-E) of the RAB reactors was higher than the BC reactors. Among the two HRT levels for the RAB reactors, the longer HRT resulted in higher TDS-E values. Among four types of wastewaters, industrial WW–high TDS led in the highest TDS-E. The Ames WW + NaCl had a lower removal efficiency.Total dissolved solids removal rate by the algal culture sys-tems was evaluated based on the liquid volume (TDS-Rvolume) and attachment surface (TDS-Rsurface). Similar to the trend of TDS-E, TDS-Rvolume of the RAB reactors was much higher than that of the BC reactor (Table 3). The industrial WW–high TDS also demonstrated the best TDS removal rate among four wastewaters. However, the Ames WW  +  NaCl had a higher removal rate due to the high input of NaCl from the influent. However, contrary to the trend of TDS-E with HRT, shorter HRT resulted in a higher TDS-Rvolume and TDS-Rsurface values for the RAB reactors (Table 3), probably due to the higher TDS mass turnover rate at shorter HRT.The use of microalgae for TDS removal has been widely reported in the suspension-based cultivation systems. For example, El-Bestawy (2008) reported that the alga Tolypothrix ceylonica r e d u c e d  T D S  b y  1 4 %  i n  m i x e d  d o m e s t i c / i n d u s-trial wastewater. Maity et al. (2014) found that the green alga Leptolyngbya sp. JPMTW1 removed 13% TDS from wastewater. Renuka, Sood, Ratha, et al. (2013) found that an algae consor-tium reduced TDS by 28% (from 1,120 to 806 mg/L). More than 50% reduction of TDS from mixed industrial wastewaters was reported with the consortium of Chlorella and Phormidium after 20 days of incubation (Das, Ramaiah, Pereira, & Naseera, 2018), while even higher TDS removal efficiency (65%–80%) was reported in industrial wastewaters (Khan et al., 2017), oil and gas production wastewater (Lutzu & Dunford, 2019), and distiller wastewater (Krishnamoorthy et al., 2019). From a percentage perspective, the TDS removal efficiency reported in this work (TDS-E [%], Table 3), particularly for the BC reactor, was in the lower end compared to the date reported in previous research. However, those previous studies were based on batch culture with 7–30 days of culture time. In this work, the BC and RAB reac-tors were based on the continuous culture resulting in a much higher volumetric removal rate (i.e., TDS-Rvolume [mg/L-day], Table 3.

Table 3). For example, the BC reactor removed TDS at a rate of 21–121 mg/L-day (Table 3) and the RAB system removed at 101–2,783 mg/L-day, while the TDS removal rates of the previ-ous reports were calculated as 9 mg/L-day (Maity et al., 2014), 25 mg/L-day (El-Bestawy, 2008), 45 mg/L-day (Renuka, Sood, Ratha, et al., 2013), 130 mg/L-day (Das et al., 2018), 349 mg/L-day (Lutzu & Dunford, 2019), 9–30 mg/L-day (Khan et al., 2017), and 4 mg/L-day (Krishnamoorthy et al., 2019). With the further process optimization such as light intensity, TDS removal effi-ciency by the RAB and BC reactors can be further increased.Figure 3.

The mechanisms of TDS removal by RAB and BC reactorsThe above results indicate that in RAB reactors, the TDS removal rate (Table 3) was much higher than the biomass productivity (Table 2). For example, the volumetric TDS removal (TDS-Rvolume) of RAB-1 was 309 ± 38 mg/L-day, while the volumet-ric biomass productivity (Pvolume) of the same reactor was only 75 ± 1 mg DW/L-day for ash-containing biomass and 52 ± 1 mg AFDW/L-day for ash-free biomass. Similar trends were also observed for other wastewater streams among RAB reactors. This drastic difference between the TDS removal and cell growth was considered due to the precipitation of TDS salt on the RAB biofilm. As a matter of fact, during the experiments, we observed a significant amount of salts precipitated on the surface of the Table 4.

RAB biofilm and removed from the system with the harvested RAB biofilm. As these abiotic precipitated salts were actually not contributing to the cell growth, they were rinsed out and not accounted when the cell growth was measured.However, from TDS removal perspective, the precipita-tion played an important role to remove TDS from the RAB system. The precipitation has been reported as one mecha-nism for TDS removal in other research (Malik, 2004; Silva, Cadorin, & Rubio, 2010). In addition to precipitation, EPS-based adsorption and the cellular absorption are another two mechanisms for TDS removal. In this work, those adsorption- and absorption-based TDS was calculated by subtracting ash-free biomass from ash-containing biomass. The contribution of precipitation on TDS removal can be estimated by subtracting the adsorption- and absorption-based TDS from the total TDS removed (TDS-Rvolume, Table 3). Using the above approaches, the relative contribution of precipitation, and adsorption/absorption to the TDS removal is presented in Figure 3. As shown in the figure, the precipitation played a major role in of the TDS removed for the RAB reactors. For the BC reactors, all the TDS removal was through the adsorption/absorption.Chloride removal performanceAs chloride is the major ion in all the four wastewaters tested (Table 1), the removal performance of this specific TDS species was investigated. Similar to the trends of TDS (Figure 2), Figure 4 shows that the effluent chloride was low initially as the culture was in transition from low chloride medium (BBM medium) to the experimental wastewater streams. Depending on the types of the wastewater and reactors, the effluent chlo-ride concentrations reached steady state in 10–20 days.The chloride removal performance is summarized in Table 4. Overall, the trends of the chloride removal efficiency and removal rate were similar to those observed in the TDS. Both chloride removal efficiency and removal rate (volume- and sur-face-based) of the RAB reactors were higher than those of the BC reactor. Among the two HRT levels, shorter HRT resulted in a lower chloride removal efficiency but much higher removal rate. Industrial WW–high TDS had the best chloride removal performance than the other three types of wastewaters. The above trends of chloride removal among reactors and the influ-ent streams were also due to the different salt removal mecha-nisms discussed earlier, that is, the chemical precipitation was considered the major mechanism in the chloride removal by the RAB reactor.It should also be noted that the microalgae may adapt to the high chloride concentration. For example, indus-trial WW-high TDS (thus high chloride) resulted in a higher algae growth, while Ames WW  +  NaCl resulted in a similar growth performance as the Ames WW (Table 2). Table 5.

Ramírez, Vélez, Rendón, and Alzate (2018) reported the use of algae in the bioremediation of water where chloride removal efficiencies ranged within 16%–40% with different species at an initial chloride concen-tration of 20 g/L.Removal of various ions from wastewaterIn addition to chloride, the removal of other major ionic components such as sodium, potassium, calcium, magne-sium, and sulfur (Table 1) from wastewaters was also deter-mined. The concentration of these metal and non-metal ions in the influent and effluent (at steady state) was evaluated. As shown in Figure 5, among various ions, sodium and cal-cium were predominant, followed with sulfur, magnesium, and potassium. The RAB reactors demonstrated ion removal capacities for all the wastewaters used. The RAB reactors at 3-day HRT (RAB-3) removed more ions than those at 1-day HRT (RAB-1) (Figure 5). When industrial WW–high TDS was used as the influent, RAB reactor removed ~50% (3-day HRT) and ~30% (1-day HRT) of these five ions from the influent, while only ~2% of these five ions was removed from the BC reactors (Figure 5b). The industrial WW–high TDS (Figure 5b) also led to the highest removal efficiency of the ions compared to other three wastewaters (Figure 5a,c,d). On the contrary, for the BC reactor, the influent and effluent concentrations of various ions were almost the same (Figure 5), indicating the BC reactors had a limited capability of removing those elements.The removal of different ion species in algal culture may be due to the cation transport through the cell membrane, adsorption, and chemical precipitation (Malik, 2004). Algae have been reported notable capabilities of removing ions such as sodium, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sulfur through biosorption (Wang et al., 2014; Zhou, Sheng, Zhao, Gross, & Wen, 2018). Zhou, Min, et al. (2012) reported 92% removal of calcium, and 20% removal of sodium, potassium, and sulfur through bio-assimilation and precipitation. In this work, the RAB reactors demonstrated a high performance of removing these metals and non-metal ions, especially for the industrial WW–high TDS. This was due to the multiple mechanism particularly through chemical precipitation. For example, the pH of initial wastewaters was at alkaline range (Table 1). The pH of the wastewaters increases to an even higher levels (data not shown). This alkaline pH may facili-tate precipitation of the ions. The impact of high pH on the phosphate precipitation has been reported (Song, Hahn, & Hoffmann, 2002). Zhou, Min, et al. (2012) also reported that calcium concentration dropped drastically when the pH exceeded 9 after 4 days of algal cultivation in municipal wastewater.Ion contents of algal biomassThe biomass harvested from the algal reactors was analyzed for its ion content. As shown in Table 5, calcium was the most predominant ion in the biomass followed with sulfur, magnesium, sodium, and potassium. Potassium content in biomass maintained at a relatively constant level (0.6%–0.7%) throughout all the experimental conditions, while cal-cium, magnesium, sodium, and sulfur contents were altered and matched with the concentration level of these ions in wastewaters.It is well known that algae have the notable biosorption ability for metal ions such as calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium, due to the negatively charged function groups on the cell surface and the ion-specific or ion group-specific sites of carriers (Ayangbenro & Babalola, 2017). Sodium and potassium adjust electro-neutrality and osmotic equilibrium of algae intracellular and extracellular environment to main-tain the appropriate functions in algal cells (Wang et al., 2014). Potassium is also the component of many proteins and enzymes required for biochemical reactions. Higher plants can actively absorb potassium and regulate absorption rate to maintain the internal stability by keeping potassium at a relatively narrow level (Schachtman & Schroeder, 1994); in this work, the stable potassium content across different biomass samples indicated algal cells may have the similar capability of adjusting potas-sium adsorption to maintain a balanced intracellular and extra-cellular osmosis (Wang et al., 2014). As for sulfur content, the results from sulfur removal from different wastewaters (Figure 5) and sulfur accumulation in biomass (Table 5) indicate that biofilm algae in RAB reactors can absorb more sulfur than the suspended algae in BC reactors. The superior capability of assimilating sulfur by the RAB algae was probably due to the physical adsorption by the EPS (Kesaano & Sims, 2014; Zhou et al., 2018).It should be noted that the data reported here are based on ash-containing biomass, that is, the precipitated ions have been washed; thus, the ions accumulated in the biomass are through adsorption/absorption. The EPS in the RAB biomass were considered the one major contributor for adsorbing TDS ions. When used to treat wastewater with high content of TDS, the various functional groups in polysaccharides such as carboxyl and hydroxyl groups adsorb those inorganic and organic matters (Flemming & Leis, 2002) and, there-fore, resulted in very high binding capacity (Guibaud & van Hullebusch, 2006; Guibaud, Tixier, Bouju, & Baudu, 2003). The binding between EPS and divalent cations such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ has also been reported as the main mechanism in maintaining the microbial aggregate structure (Mayer et al., 1999).ConclusionThis work demonstrates that the feasibility of using RAB reac-tors as a sustainable and environmentally friendly method can efficiently remove TDS from wastewaters. Depending on the HRT and type of wastewaters, the efficiencies of removing TDS, chloride, and ions of the RAB reactors were higher than the suspended algal culture system. The precipitation, EPS-based adsorption, and cellular absorption all contributed to the TDS removal from the RAB reactor, and precipitation was the major contributor. While in the suspended culture Water Environment Research • 92: 766–778, 2020 777RESEARCH ARTICLEsystems, adsorption and absorption play the major role for TDS removal. In order to implement the system at a com-mercial scale, the operational parameters of the RAB system need to be optimized together with a thorough cost analysis.AcknowledgmentsThis project was funded by Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago (Grant #: 14-062-AP).
