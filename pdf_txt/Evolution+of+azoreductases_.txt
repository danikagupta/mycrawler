ABSTRACT  
METABOLISM  OF AZO DYES  BY

Azo dye food colourants are widely used in Canada and other countries. When ingested, 
these dyes may be reduced by azoreductases of the gut microbiome bacteria to metabolites that 
might have immune -, neuro- , or genotoxic effects.  I have identified obligat e anaerobic bacterial 
species from the human gut that reduce these azo food dyes. Bacterial species representing six 
phyla were derived from human fecal microbiomes. Bacteria were incubated on dye -infused 
plates and decolourization was monitored by visual inspection. Taxa exhibiting high azoreductase activity belonged to the genera Clostridium , Hungatella, Enterocloster , Veillonella , 
Dielma , Eggerthella, Odoribacter , and Phocaeicola . The effects of the dyes on bacterial growth 
were studied. The genome seque nces of two Veillonella  spp. with high azo dye reduction 
activities were examined. Candidate genes were cloned and expressed as recombinant proteins, but none showed detectable azo dye reduction activity in vitro.

 1  Literature Review and Research Objectives   
1.1 Introduction 
 Dyes have been used by humans for centuries in  materials such as foods, pharmaceuticals, 
cosmetics, textiles, and plastics
1. They can be used for improving the appearance of foods, 
adding colour to colourless products, and allowing consumers to identify products (especially 
drugs) on sight2. Until the 19th Century, all dyes came from natural sources, such as vegetable 
extracts and animal products; however, these materials only gave limited colours and faded easily
3. The synthetic dye industry began with the invention of the first synthetic dye in 18564. 
While William H. Perkin was attempting to synthesize the anti- malaria l drug quinine, he 
discovered that when aniline was oxidized, using nitric and sulphuric acids, a purple colour was 
produced4. The purple compound was a phenazine dye, which Perkin named mauveine (Figure 
1.1)4. This was the first industrially produced synthetic dye, and it had rapid commercial 
success4. Synthetic dyes rapidly began to replace natural dyes due to their quick synthesis and 
colour stability, making them a more economical option in comparison to natural dyes5.

 1.1.1 Azo Dye S tructure  
 
Dyes are coloured substance s that, when applied to products , adhere  by the formation of  
covalent bond, mechanical retention, or physical adsorption
6. The colour of the dye is determined 
by the ability of the structure to absorb light within the visible range (400 -700 nm)3. 
Chromophores are functional groups in the dye structure that absorb light, typically groups that 
are aromatic or have conjugated bonds, such as, nitro, azo or quinoid groups3. The colour is 
caused by the excitation of valence π electrons3. Azo dyes are characterized by one or more  azo 
bonds  [R-N=N -R]7. This double -bonded nitrogen structure allows for azo dyes to produce 
brilliant colours7.  
Today, synthetic azo dyes are still widely used in pharmaceutical products, cosmetics, and 
food products8. The annual use of azo dyes in food processing is estimated at one million tons 
globally9. Even though select azo dyes have been approved by food regulatory agencies, food 
items containing synthetic colour have been increasingly avoided by consumers due to concern 
about possible he alth effects8. The chronic effects of azo dye ingestion have been studied for 
several decades, given that the reduction of these dyes by microbes can lead to the formation of toxic products, such as aromatic amines
8. Since the human intestinal tract ha s a large and diverse 
community of microbes, the metabolites produced by azo dye degradation should be of concern with regard to the safety of the use of dyes food products
8.  
 
1.1.2 Azo Dye History  
 
The first azo compounds were synthesized by Johann Peter Gri ess, who discovered that 
aniline could react with nitrous oxide, forming a compound with twice as much nitrogen4. Griess 
then coupled the se diazo compounds with aromatic compounds to create a double bonded 
nitrogen (N=N) link between the aromatic groups , giving rise to bright colours which are  
 
  
3 
 characteristic of azo dyes4. Griess’ discovery led to the first azo dye, aniline yellow, which was 
manufactured in 1861, with the colour B ismark Brown following in 1863 (Figure 1.2)3. The 
German chemist Bottiger used Griess’ chemistry to form a bis -diazo compound derived from 
benzidine, which produced Congo Red, the first benzidine-based azo dye (Figure 1.3)4. The 
1890s became the ‘mauve decade’, where the chemical dye industry flourished and synthetic 
dyes almost wholly replaced natural dyes3. The production of synthetic benzidine dyes spread 
from Germany to England and the United States4. In 1895, Dr. Ludwig Rehn reported the 
dangers of aniline production after observing a relationship between  workers producing aniline 
and the development of bladder cancer, seeing more than 50 cases among dye industry workers 
in the Frankfurt area4. Few occupational hygiene measures were taken regarding chemical 
industry workers until after World War II, where subsequent studies linked benzidine exposure to a 60-fold increased risk of bladder cancer compared to non-exposed controls
4. The cancer was 
likely caused b y aromatic amines, such as benzidine, that were being produced in the dye 
factories4. This discovery made it apparent that legislation needed to control dye manufacturing. 
By the 1950s, it was accepted that benzidine was a significant occupational hazard as a bladder carcinogen
4. When benzidine- based azo dyes are ingested, they are reduced to aniline and 
benzidine by the action of azoreductase enzymes in the gut4. The metabolism of azo dyes ma y 
generate toxic products.

1.2 Azo Dye s: Regulatory Aspects   
 
Government regulation of  azo dyes began in 1883 with the work of Harvey  W. Wiley, the 
head chemist at what is now the U.S. Department of Agriculture10. He was known as the “Father 
of the Pure Food and Drugs Act”, 190610. This act originally listed  seven coal -tar dyes as safe for 
use in Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) Dyes (Table 1 .1)10. Ten more dyes were added 
between 1916-1929, including Methyl Y ellow (Table 1.2)10. Methyl Y ellow ( N,N-
dimethylaminoazobenzene, DAB) was first used as a food additive in 1918 (Figure 1.4)11. In 
1948, James and Elizabeth Miller discovered  that its metabolite 4-monomethyl- aminobenzene 
cause liver tumours in mice12. This discovery led to the investigation into the carcionogenic bio-
activation of conjugated dyes11. In 1975, 32 synthetic dyes were permitted for food use by UK 
legislation , but by 1973, 19 of these dyes had been removed due to toxic effects10,13. Azo dyes 
may be “pro -toxicants”, where the parent compound may not itself be toxic, but can be bio-
transformed into metabolites (e.g. colourless aromatic amines ) that are1.

 1.3 Azo Dye Food Safety  
 
Today, azo dyes are the largest group of colorants produced worldwide, both in volume and 
number , constitut ing approximately 70% of all organic dyes
14. The popularity of azo dyes is 
attributed to the ir simple synthesis, structural diversity , high molar extinction coefficients , and  
photolytic and chemical stability  (making them resistant to fading )3. Food dye safety remains a 
major issue around the world. Currently, Canada allows only four azo dyes to be used in food 
products : Amaranth, A llura R ed, S unset Y ellow and T artrazine (Figure 1.5 )15. All of the 
permitted azo dyes are sulphonated compounds, giving better water solubility. Sulphonated compounds are easily excreted in urine, which may lessen any  toxic effects. The European Food 
Safety Authority (EFSA) is currently investigating whether certain food dyes increase hyperactivity in children
10. If this concern is substantiated, manufacturers may have to abandon 
the use of Tartrazine, Sunset Yellow , Allura R ed, Quinoline Yellow, P onceau 4R and 
Carmoisine (Figure 1.5, Figure 1.6) (Table 1.3) in their products10.

1.3.1 Amaranth  
The azo dye A maranth (FD&C Red No. 2 and E123) is still used commonly, although 
Soviet scientists determined in 1969 that the long- term use of this dye caused cancer in 
laboratory animals (Figure 1.5)10. In 1976 the FDA banned A maranth, while Canadian regulators 
conc luded that there was insufficient evidence to justify removal of the dye from food10.  In 1984 
the estimated ADI for A maranth was determined as 0.5 mg/kg by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert 
Committee on Food Additives (JECFA ). In 1994, Sweeney et al . found that both Amaranth and 
Sunset Yellow  metabolites did not mutate S. typhimurium  strains TA100 and TA98, but did 
mutate TA102, suggesting both compounds may cause oxidative mutagenesis16. When reduced 
 
 
  
10 
 by repair -deficient E. coli, Sunset Yellow and Amaranth induced DNA damage
16. The EFSA 
determined that the ADI for Amaranth should be lowered  to 0.15 mg/kg b w when re -evaluated in 
2010. It was determined by the EFSA that at the 97.5th percentile of consumption of food 
colouring, the predicted  exposure to Amaranth may be as much as  6 times higher than the ADI of 
0.15mg/kg bw , suggesting it is likely  that an individual will exceed the ADI for Amaranth . This 
is compounded by the fact that  in Canada, food product s do not have to list th e amount of dye  
content .   
1.3.2  Allura Red  
 Allura Red, also known as FD&C Red No. 40 or E129, is a synthetic red azo dye 
commonly used as a food colourant (Figure 1.5). This dye was evaluated in 1981 by JECFA to 
have an ADI of 7 mg/kg;  the ADI was  re-evaluated in 2016 and was not altered. In 2009, 
Shimada et al . found that A llura R ed and A maranth caused colon -specific DNA damage in  
mice17. Mice were administered 1 -10 mg/kg dye via gavage . Brain, liver, kidney, glandular 
stomach, colon, urinary bladder and bone marrow were sampled 3 h after treatment17. The comet 
assay showed DNA damage for colon cells of the mice 3 h after A llura R ed and A maranth  
administration  at 10  mg/kg17. This result was not seen when a corresponding study was 
conducted in rats with up to 1000 mg/ kg dye  administered17. These results match the 
inconclusive results by the Working Group of IARC for A maranth toxicity in mice, rats,  and 
dogs17.  Allura R ed has  not been found to be carcinogenic in rats or mice but  show ed evidence of 
behavioural  and physical toxicity in developing rats18. Vohrees et al . discovered that exposure to 
Red 40 led to decreased wheel activity  in rats , which contrasts with the hyperactivit y reported in 
children19. In 2021, He et al. discovered that  in mice with ov er-expression of IL -23, Allura Red 
and Tartrazine metabolism induced colitis, and that  its induction  was contingent  on the  reduction 
of the dyes by the  commensal microbiota20.

 1.3.3    Sunset Yellow  
 
 The ADI of azo dye Sunset Yellow FCF (FD&C Yellow 6 or E 110) was determined to 
be 2.5 mg/kg body weight (bw) , which was established in 1982 by JECFA ; the value  was re-
evaluated in 2011 and changed to 4 mg/kg bw. In 2009, the EFSA lowered the ADI to 1 mg/kg 
bw, and then  the EFSA  increased the ADI to  4 mg/kg bw , to be consistent  with the  ADI set by 
JECFA.  
It is speculated that S unset Y ellow, A llura R ed and Tartrazine cause hyperactivity in 
children. The first study to link hyperactivity in children with synthetic food colourants was 
published by Feingold in 1975
21. Later , McCann et al . performed  a randomized, double -blind, 
placebo -controlled, crossover trial to test the relation between hypersensitivity in children and 
consumption of food colour additives22. Two drink mixes  (drink mix A and drink mix B)  were 
given to childr en and hyperactivity was monit ored, drink mix A included: 5 mg Sunset  Yellow, 
2.5 mg Carmoisine , 7.5 mg Tartrazine and 5 mg Ponceau  4R, and drink mix B included:  45 mg 
sodium benzoate, 7.5 mg S unset Y ellow, 7.5 mg C armoisine, 7.5 mg Q uinoline Y ellow and 7.5 
mg A llura R ed22. Both drink mixes increased hyperactivity in the children; however , this could 
have been a result of  the sodium benzoate preservative or the artificial colours , since the control 
drink did not include the sodium benzoate preservative22. In 2020, El -Borm et al ., demonstrated 
that S unset Y ellow and T artrazine induced apoptosis and DNA damage when administered in 
ovo of 1.575 or  0.375 mg/egg during the organogenesis phase of the chick embryo23. These dyes 
may have teratogenic effects at  high doses and should be re -evaluated by the JECFA23. In 2009, 
the EFSA published a scientific opinion on the re -evaluation of S unset Y ellow stated that in the 
general E uropean population, refined intake is typically below the temporary 1 mg/kg bw ADI . 
However , in 1–10- year-old children the mean and high percentile of exposure (97.5th) can be 
0.6-5.8 mg/kg bw/day24. Products including azo dyes are heavily used in consumables targeted 
for children , such as soda and candy;  this could be contributing to the  consum ption of  azo dye s  
 
  
12 
 by some children above  the ADI recommendations.  
 
1.3.4 Tartrazine  
 
Tartrazine, also known as FD&C Yellow No. 5 or E102 in Europe, is a synthetic yellow azo 
dye commonly used as a food colourant (Figure 1. 5)
15. Tartrazine is found in soft drinks, sport s 
drinks, flavoured chips, sauces, ice creams, chewing gums, and non- food consumables such as 
vitamins, cosmetics, soaps, shampoos, and prescription medications15. The ADI  for T artrazine is 
7.5 mg/kg bw/day, which would be the equivalent of 225 mg per day for a 30 kg child. Early 
studies showed that this food dye is safe to consume at the ADI, since no harmful effects were 
observed in human or  experimental models25. In many Ames test studies, with or without S9  
enzymes , it was also shown that T artrazine was no t mutagenic with a daily intake of 7.5 mg/kg 
body weight26. Recent investigations ha ve challenged the safety of Tartrazine, reporting that it 
can induce angio- edema, immunotoxic and genotoxic effects, exacerbations of asthma and 
urticaria in atopic patients27. Tartrazine may be responsible for triggering asthma and urticaria 
attacks, particularly in individuals who already have aspirin intole rance27.  
The genotoxicity of T artrazine has been controversial because of the varying results in 
studies. Many studies on mutagenicity have demonstrated that T artrazine has no mutagenic 
potential, yet other more recent studies have revealed genotoxicity26. Tartrazine was shown to 
induce chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster cells by Ishidate et al. in 1981 as well as in 
rat somatic cells by Giri et al.  in 199026,28. However, in 1995, Durnev et al.  did not observe  
chromosomal aberrations in mouse  cells29. In a 2017 study, Khayyat et al.  randomly divided 20 
Wistar albino rats into two groups with Group 1 orally receiving 1m g/kg bw distilled water for 
30 days and Group 2 orally receiving 7.5 mg/kg bw T artrazine dissolved in water for 30 days15. 
Leukocytes were harvested from the rats and a comet assay was performed ; when exposed to 
Tartrazine there was a significant increase in  leukocyte DNA comet length , demonstrating  
 
  
13 
 genotoxicity in tested cells
15.  Khayyat et al. also measured blood levels of serum ALT, AST and 
ALP, which were significantly elevated in the group that was administered Tartrazine, indicating 
liver damage15. The serum levels of creatine, urea and uric acid were also significantly elevated 
in the T artrazine -administered group indicating kidney damage15. These results led Khayyat et 
al. to propose that the mechanism of damage is oxidative stress generated by T artrazine 
metabolism15. 
1.3.5 Tartrazine Metabolism  
 
In a 1962 publication, Daniel reported on the metabolism of T artrazine administered to 
rabbits via a stomach tube30. He used paper chromatography to show that the part of the 
Tartrazine molecule originating from sulphanilic acid was excreted in the urine as sulphanilic 
acid (74%) and N-acetylsulphanilic acid (22%), demonstrating that the T artrazine molecule 
underwent a reductive fission30. In the same year, Ryan and Wright report ed that when they gave 
small amounts of T artrazine to rats intraperitoneally , no amine  metabolites were d etected  in the 
urine30. This finding indicat es that reductive  cleavage of T artrazine did not take place  after 
intraperitoneal  administration , suggesting that  orally administered  Tartrazine is metabolized 
mainly by the intestinal microbiota rather than in the liver30.  
In 1964, Jones, Ryan and Wright conducted a study on the excretion of sulphanilic acid in 
animals and humans given Tartrazine but  did not document any other metabolites30. In 1965, 
Westöö  studied the metabolism of T artrazine in ra ts and found a different metabolite from the 
pyrazolone part of the T artrazine molecule30. Westöö  discovered that rats given T artrazine via 
gastric intubation at 0.03- 0.3 g/kg bw produced feces of normal colour immediately after 
excretion, but, following air exposure, the fecal pellets acquired a violet tinge. The rats were 
sacrificed and dissected 4 -16 h after Tartrazine administration ; the caeca  changed to violet when 
exposed to air. However,  the small intestine did not show any violet colouring. When the violet 
compound in the feces was extracted with water at room temperature, there was a colour shift in  
 
  
14 
 the solution from violet to red. The violet products showed stability at pH 7.0- 8.5 and the same 
absorption wavelengths of  light (maxima and minima) as the compound 4- amino -5-oxo-1-(p-
sulphophenyl) -2-pyrazoline -3-carboxylic acid (Figure 1.7). Under  a N
2 atmosphere, no violet 
compound is formed (Figure 1.7). Therefore, the violet product was proposed to have the 
structure produced from taking up an oxygen molecule  and expelling ammonia (Figure 1.7). 
Westöö’s metabolite (Figure 1.7.1) is the speculated product of aerobic T artrazine metabolism; 
the structure has not been proved definitively. In 2008, Perez -Diaz and McFeeters us ed 
Lacticasei bacillus  casei and  Lact icasei bacillus paracasei  to aerobically metabolize  Tartrazine 31. 
The reduction metabolites were identified with liquid chromatography- mass spectrometry (LC -
MS) analysis and a product that was 111 Da  larger than the precursor molecule  was found31. This 
product was purple under aerobic conditions and colourless under anaerobic conditions31.

In 2017, Elbana et al . demonstrated that T artrazine, Sunset Yellow, C armoisine and P onceau 
4R are decolourized by multiple intestinal bacterial species , such as Lactobacillus spp., E. coli, 
and Enterobacter spp.8. In 1978, Chung et al. showed that T artrazine, Sunset Yellow, A maranth 
and A llura Red could be metabolized by certain strains of Fusobacterium sp ., Bacteroides 
thetaiotaomicron and Citrobacter sp.32. In 1997, Rafii et al.  obtained Clostridium  spp. from the 
human intestinal tract and determined that these strains facilitated decolorization of T artrazine, 
Sunset Yellow and A llura R ed7. They then tested for mutagenicity in S. enterica Typhimurium 
 
 
  
17 
 Ames test  strains TA98 and TA100, which detect  frame -shift mutations and  base- pair 
substitution s or mutations
7. At doses from  0.1-10 mg/plate, none of the dyes or their metabolites 
were mutagenic in the presence or absence of rat or hamster liver S97.  
1.4 Mechanism of Azo Dye Metabolism  
 
Since the 19th Century, the use of azo compounds in the environment and food products has 
increased substantially, with the dyestuff and textile industries being the largest producers of azo 
dyes1. It is estimated that 15% of all the dyes synthesized worldwide will enter the environment 
as industrial effluent33. Azo dyes can cause serious damage to aquatic ecosystems due to their 
photo- stability, resulting in high persistence causing water turbidity11. The metabolism of these 
compounds is facilitated by specific enzymes, ‘Azoreductases’. Azoreductases are a family of 
diverse enzymes found in many bacterial species; homologues are present in eukarya34. These 
enzymes may be important for bioremediation to prevent accumulation of  these dyes as  
pollutants11. 
1.4.1 Azoreductase  
 
Azo bonds are mainly degraded through reductive mechanisms, caused by contact with 
microorganisms in the environment, by bacteria in a mammalian intestinal tract, or  the liver1. In 
certain cases, azo dyes can also be degraded by peroxidases and oxidases through oxidative 
reactions35. The most common pathway of biological azo degradation is through a group of 
enzymes, azoreductases, which are flavoenzymes34. These enzymes have been characterized in 
aerobic and anaerobic bacteria as well as in eukaryotes such as yeast and mammals34. Three 
groups of  azoreductases have been found and identified in a range of bacterial genera, including 
Escherichia, Bacillus , Pseudomonas , Geobacillus, Lysinibacillus, Enterococcus, Eubacterium 
and Clostridium1,36–39. Two of the three groups are flavin -dependent enzymes, classified into 
NADH- preferred and NADPH -preferred azoreductases, while the third group is flavin- free  
 
  
18 
 azoreductase
1,36. The flavin -dependent enzymes, such as P. aeruginosa (AzoR) or Enterococcus 
faecalis  (AzoA), use  the flavin (FMN or FAD)  to transfer electrons from NAD(P)H to 
substrates39. The purported azoreductase reaction is a Ping Pong Bi -Bi mechanism , where the 
first electron transfer results in a  hydrazone tautomer of the substrate (Figure 1.8)40. The second 
electron transfer to the substrate allows for the azo bond to be reduced completely40. The 
intestinal microbiota reduces azo dyes under anaerobic conditions via flavin- dependent 
azoreductases . Flavin -free NADPH- preferred azoreductases reduce azo bonds by  simultaneously 
joining the substrate and electron donor together in the active site ; then , a direct hydride transfer  
happens in the reaction center36. This binding mechanism purportedly has a high substrate 
specificity , where out of the 9 substrates tes ted, Orange I was the only compound reduc ed36. 
These enzymes have been purified from Xenophilus azovorans KF46F and Pigmentiphaga kullae  
K2441. Flavin -dependent azoreductases are more common and can  metabolize almost all azo 
dyes, due to their broad substrate specificity1.

Figure 1.8:  Formation  of hydrazone  tautomer  of Tartrazine and  its reduction to form  two 
putative  metabolite s40. 
 
The biological role of these azoreductase enzymes remains uncertain , but has  typically  been 
attributed to the  detoxication of antibacterial  quinones produced by some plants34. These 
enzymes can reduce a broad range of substrates including nitrofurans , azo -compounds and 
quinones34. The mechanism of reduction explains the ability for azoreductases to reduce both 
quinone and azo substrates, potentially resulting in azoreductases being classified as NAD(P)H 
quinone oxidoreductases (NQOs)40. Mammalian azo reductases typically have very low 
sequence identity with bacterial enzymes,  but they reduce both quinone and azo compounds40.  
 
 
  
20 
 1.4.2 Subcellular L ocalization  
 Much remains unknown concerning the mechanisms of the interactions of azo dye 
substra tes with bacterial azoreductase enzymes.  The debate whether the dyes are taken up by the 
cell or excreted into the environment is still ongoing and the outcome may be different 
depending on the organism . However , there is increasing evidence that these enzymes may be 
secreted. In 1990, Rafii et al . showed that azoreductase enzymes are secreted in the presence of 
azo dye s for the  bacterial species Eubacterium  spp., Clostridium  spp., Bacteroides  sp. a nd 
Butyrivibrio  sp
42. These species were isolated from the human intestinal microbiome and tested 
for the ability to reduce Direct Blue 5 or Nitro Red with dye -infused plates, crude protein 
extracts and supernatant extracts ; the highest specific activity of supernatant  extracts was seen 
for C. perfringens  and C. clostridiiforme42. There was more enzyme in the supernatants than in 
the cell lysate, suggesting that the enzymes are extracellularly excreted42.  
In 2014 Morrison and John discovered and characterized a novel azoreductase in 
Clostridium perfringens (AzoC) that has a trimeric structure , whereas all other classified 
azoreductase enzymes have dimeric structures43. C. perfringens  is an  anaerobic microorganis m 
that inhabits the human intestine and produces an azoreductase (AzoC), an NADH -dependent 
flavin oxidoreductase43. The authors  stated that azoreductase secretion in Clostridium 
perfringens  was in response  to sul phonated azo dye exposure 44. Through exposure studies, azo 
dyes were found to cause cytoplasmic protein release ; sulphonation (negative charge) of azo 
dyes was key in facilitating protein release of AzoC and found to be dye -dependent 44. AzoC was 
found to localize to the Gram -positive periplasmic region 44  This idea was supported by Raf ii 
and Cerniglia  in 1993, w here the hypothesized azoreductase in C. perfringe ns was antibody 
labelled to identify the cellular localization of this protein , and  it was observed that  it was 
synthesized in the cytoplasm and then secreted45.    
 
  
21 
 1.4.3 Azoreductase Phylogeny   
 
 Recently there have been many advances in  genome sequencing methods, such as small-
subunit (SSU) rRNA (16S rRNA) gene sequencing or quantitative PCR coupled with denaturing 
gradient gel electrophoresis
1,46. These techniques have given a better understanding of the roles 
of communal microbiota that are difficult to culture, includ ing their mutualistic relationship with 
the host as well as associations with different diseases46. Azoreductases are ubiquitous among 
organisms and are found in prokaryot es (anaerobes and aerobes) a s well as  eukaryot es47. Bafana 
and Chakrabarti endeav oured to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the azoreductase enzyme 
family by comparing database azoreductase sequences with the phylogeny of the organisms 
obtained using SSU rRNA sequences47. For the analysis, sequences from nine bacterial, four 
mammalian and one yeast species were selected; both nucleic acid and protein acid sequences 
were obtained from Genbank47.  Sequences of the conserved azoreductase domains  were 
compared  to the SSU rRNA phylogeny, taking into account the flavin nucleotide bi nding site, 
and the homology betwee n similar species , bacterial or otherwise,  was determined to be 
inconsistent47.  Instead,  it was discovered that the yeast azoreductase sequence aligned with 
prokaryotic sequences47. Several  similarities were found between azoreductases of E. coli , E. 
faecalis  and mammals, such as their NAD(P) -binding residues  and the enzymes existing in 
dimeric form, and furthermore the flavin nucleotide binding residues were highly conserved in 
all azoreductases47. It is proposed that azoreductases originated in prokaryotic cell s and were 
laterally transferred from ancient Bacillota (Firmicutes) , through a series of isolated  events, to 
yeasts and mammals47. 
1.4.4 The Gut Microbiota  
  The human intestinal tract plays a large role in degrading xenobiotics into metabolites, 
some of which can cause genotoxicity or carcinogenicity1. Human exposure to azo dyes can  
 
  
22 
 occur through inhalation, skin contact or ingestion
48. If ingested, azo dyes can be bio-
transformed into colourless aromatic amines which may  be carcinogenic48. Despite the fact that 
azo dye -containing textiles, food colourings and pharmaceuticals have been used for over 150 
years, understanding of the organisms – and the specific enzymes -  that metabolize these 
molecules49 remains incomplete.  There has been lit tle characterization of azoreductase enzymes 
in human gut bacterial species that show azoreductase activity49. Azoreductase activity has been 
studied for different species of facultative anaerobes, such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa, Bacill us spp., and Enterococcus spp.50 43.  Azoreductase activity has also been 
studied for many obligate anaerobic species  Clostridium spp., Eubacterium spp., Fusobacterium 
spp., Sphingomonas spp., Citrobacter sp ., Bifidobacterium sp p., Coprococcus sp ., 
Peptostreptococcus spp., Veillonella par vula, Acidaminococcus sp ., and Bacteroides 
spp.11,43,50,51. However , enzyme characterization has been mainly carried out for facultative 
anaerobic bacteria, whereas obligate anaerobic species have been largely ignored43.   
 It is believed that bacterial isolates may vary in their ability to reduce different dyes, 
meaning that the toxic effects of azo dyes  could be contingent  on the dye -reducing species 
present  and the structure of the dye49. The most common bacterial species in our intestines are 
anaerobic members of the Bacteroidota ( Bacteroidetes ) and Bacillota  phyla  52. Included within 
the Gram positive Bacillota  phyla, are the Clostridia class and the Enterococcaceae and 
Lactobacillaceae families1. Some tested members of these groups  are more active at reducing 
certain azo dyes than others, and toxic metabolites can occur in the gut depending on the ingested dye. Other species that comprise fewer  than 10% of the intestinal microbiota  are 
include d in the  phyla  Actinobacteria, Fusobacte ria, Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia
1. The 
majority of azoreductase research has focused  on facultative anaerobic bacteria (and especially 
members of Proteobacteria) with minimal work reflecting strictly anaerobic bacteria in the 
human gut microbiome.  
  
 
  
23 
 1.5  Rational e and Research  Objectives  
 
 Research has proven that xenobiotics, such as azo dyes, can be metabolized by the human 
gut microbiome . However , there is limited information concerning which species in the human 
gut microbiome can reduce azo bonds. There is even less information on the azoreductase 
enzyme found in obligate anaerobe species. These studies will illuminate which bacterial species 
are able to reduce azo bonds within a typical gut microbiome and the involvement of human 
azoreductas e enzymes. It is important to understand the metabolism of food additives, especially 
those that are consumed in large amounts. As there is controversy over the  impact of azo dyes on 
health, there is certainly a need for further research into food colourant azo dyes in order to 
determine how they are metabolized by the human gut microbiome. This will be explored 
through plate assay and enzyme activity -based  processes.  
The overall objectives of my research are to : (1) i dentify the prevalence of azo dye 
metabolism by the intestinal microbiota using an established strain library ; (2) determine enzyme 
activity from identified  strains  with the four azo food dyes, Tartrazine, Sunset Yellow, Allura 
Red and Amaranth , (3) a ssess whether t he presence of food azo dyes a ffects the growth of 
bacterial species , and  (4) identify a  putative azoreductase in  a bacterial species  which has the 
ability to  reduce the dyes of interest .

 2 Azo D ye Metabolism in the Gut M icrobiome 
2.1 Introduction 
The toxicity and carcinogenicity of azo food dyes ha ve been studie d in in vivo  models , 
focusing on dye ingestion in ani mals and in vitro  tests for microbial dye reduction. Many azo 
dyes that when reduced produce toxic  metabolites  have been removed from use in food products ; 
however, these dyes are  still heavily prevalent in clothing production wastewater effluent
53. 
These hazardous dyes are reduced by environmental microbes in the soil and water column53,54. 
There has thus been a recent  focus on soil microbes azoreductase characterization with respect to  
carcinogenic dyes53. This research  has been extended to azoreductase activity in  human 
microbial communities , specifically  to identify species with azo dye reduction capabilities. The 
classification of “azoreductase” properties in human gut microbiome species , regarding azo dyes  
found in food products , cannot be extrapolated from experiments  performed with c arcinogenic 
dyes (such as Orange I,  Sudan I, Ponceau 3R  etc.) , which  are not used in food products  in the 
western world1,10. Species in the human gut microbiome encounter azo food dyes daily ; chronic 
ingestion of one or more food azo dyes may cause shifts in human microbial communities , but 
this has yet to be determined. 
In order to identify which bacterial species can reduce the  four azo food dyes used in 
Canada, each substrate must be tested individually. Therefore,  Amaranth, Allura Red, Sunset 
Yellow and Tartrazine were selected for testing against  gut-derived  bacterial  isolates from 
several donors . Determining which species in a bacterial community can reduce a specific azo 
dye is an important step towards understanding the fate of these additives when they are ingested 
in foods. In this chapter, as well as det ermining which gut -derived bacterial species have food 
azo dye reductive capabilities, t he growth of individual s trains when exposed t hese four azo dyes 
is also investigated , in order  to test whether  some bacterial strains might be  sensitiv e to the 
presenc e of either the compounds themselves or their metabolites.   
 
  
25 
 2.2  Methods  
2.2.1  Human Microbiome Strain Selection  
Strains were selected from the strain collection the from Allen -Vercoe lab. The strain 
library  used for this work  consists of isolates of species  from fecal samples of various donors. 
Isolates from t wo healthy donors (Donor 5 and Donor 6) were selected for initial azoreductase 
screening as representative of species in a healthy human gut microbiome. These strains were 
suspended in freezing media ( Appendix 1) and were grown on Fastidious Anaerobic Agar  
(LabM)  supplemented with 5% sheep’s blood (Hemostat Laboratories) and incubated in an 
Anaerobe Systems anaerobic chamber at 37 °C under an atmosphere of  10% CO
2, 10% H 2, and 
80% N 2. After  each  strain selected for testing  demonstrated growth on agar plates , a 
representative colony was selected and re-steaked . Following further incubation and growth, 
each strain ’s identity  was confirmed by extracting crude DNA  from subsample  of biomass 
scraped from  the plate , and using this  as a template in PCR for 16S rRNA gene -based species 
identification as described in Section 2.1.2. Once isolates with azoreductase capabilities had been identified , different strains of the same species from other donors were sel ected from the A llen-
Vercoe lab collection and  tested.  
 
2.2.2  16S rRNA Gene Sequence Analysis for Speci es Identification  
Table 2.1 lists bacterial strains used in this thesis and their sources. Sanger sequencing 
was used to confirm the identities of the bacterial species from previously characterized 
communities; targets for Sanger sequencing were ~1kbp fragments of the 16S rRNA gene  that 
were first amplified by PCR. Crude DNA was used as the template and  a small ( ~1 μl) amount of 
biomass was added to an aliquoted PCR master mix  which included: 10X Thermo pol Reaction 
Buffer (Biolabs), 20 μ M dNTP (Invitrogen), Taq polymerase (BioBasic), with 1 μ l crude 
template DNA. The V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified using the primers V3kl (5N - 
 
  
26 
 TACGG[AG]AGGCAGCA-3N ) and V6r (5 N-AC[AG]ACACGAGCTGACGAC -3N). The 
reaction conditions were  94°C for 2 min, (30s at 94°C, 30s at 60°C, 30s at 70°C) x 30 then  72°C 
for 5 min. The PCR products were confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis with staining with  
Red Safe dye ( iNtRON)  after mixing with  1× loading  dye ( DyeNA -View ) using a 1kb DNA 
molecular size ladder (Thermo Scientific)  as a size guide. PCR products were then sent for 
Sanger sequencing  at the Advanced Analysis Centre (University of Guelph) using BigDye 
Terminator v.3.1 (ThermoF isher) chemistry . Obtained sequences were BLASTed against the 
NCBI nucleotide database ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/
) to infer identity.  
 
2.2.3 Azoreductase Identification Plate Assay  
For preliminary azoreductase testing, Fastidious anaerobic agar (FAA) plates (Neogen) 
were infused with 250 mg/L of 0.22 micron filter sterilized  Amaranth, Allura Red, Sunset 
Yellow , Tartrazine or Evans Blue (Sigma) . Dye plates were allowed to ‘ degas ’ (equ ilibrate with 
an anaerobic environment to ensure oxygen is displaced) in the anaerobe chamber for at least 1 
hour before plating strains. Plates were divided into four, five, or six sections and 1μ l of biomass 
was streaked as a lawn onto each  section . Plates were incubated  in the anaerobe chamber at 37 °C 
for 72 h, and then  removed for assessment , Tartrazine plates were exposed to air for 1 h and then 
images were taken of the plates . Results were plotted visually onto a phylogenetic tree that was 
created using  a global alignment with a cost matrix of 93% similarity,  and a Jukes-Cantor genetic 
distance model with neighbour-joining, by Geneious consensus phylogenetic tree building software  Version 2020.03.

All reagents were allowed to degas in the anaerobe chamber for 24 h before plate assays 
were performed. Strains of interest were grown in 0.22 micron filter  sterilized Brain Heart 
Infusion (BHI) broth (Difco) in sterile glass test tubes at 37°C in the anaerobic chamber with the 
atmosphere:  10% CO 2, 10% H 2, 80% N 2. Strains were inoculated into media by scraping a 1μ g

OD600 >0.05. A ll strains were standardized in BHI  medi um to OD600 = 0.05 (with exception of 
the Dielma fastidiosa  strain which was grown and standardized to OD600 = 0.02).  Azo dyes 
(Amaranth, Allura Red, Sunset Yellow or Tartrazine) were added to BHI broth to final 
concentration = 250 μM and then 0.22 micron filter sterilized. The strains were screened using

37°C, housed in a B aker Concept anaerobe chamber under an atmosphere of 10% CO
2, 10% H 2, 
80% N 2.  Measurements  were taken over a 24 h period at the peak wavelength for each dye 
(Amaranth:  521 nm, Allura Red:  406 nm, Sunset Yellow: 481 nm, Tartrazine: 427 nm) every 30 
min. All strains tested are listed in Table 2.1. Kinetics plots were  drawn with Prism 9 
(GraphPad) . 
Four technical replicates were completed for each strain and the standard deviation of the 
mean was calculated. Outliers were detected and remo ved using the ROUT test with Q = 1%. 
The statistical significance of reduction was calculated using paired t -test in Prism 9 (GraphPad ) 
and was determined to be (P>0.05). A negative control of BHI medi um without strains or azo 
dyes added was included on ea ch plate to establish the baseline absorbance of the  media . A 
positive control of BHI supplemented with azo dye (Amaranth, Allura Red, Sunset Yellow, 
Tartrazine) was included to establish the baseline absorbance s of the dye media. 
2.2.5 Growth C urve Assay  
 For conducting growth curve assays, the same protocol was used as in section 2.1.4, 
except that wavelength 600 nm was employed, and data points were collected every 15 min. This 
assay was completed for dyes Sunset Yellow and Tartrazine at final concentrati on 250 μM.  The 
presence of dyes Allura Red and Amaranth at 250 μM  interfered with the readings for growth at 
OD600 and therefore, for these dyes, growth curves were not carried out . For strain growth 
analysis the same protocol was conducted as in section 2.1.4, apart from measuring the growth of 
the strains at 600 nm.  A negative control of BHI media without strains or azo dyes added was 
included on each plate to  ensure media sterility. A  positive control of  BHI supplemented with 
either Tartrazine or Sunset  Yellow was included to establish the baseline absorbance s of the dye 
media.

 2.3 Results  
2.3.1 Azo Dye R educt ion Plate Assay 
In order to understand the extent of azo dye reduction capabilit y among diverse gut 
microbiota strains, a screening plate assay was utilized. In this test, azo dyes were infused into a 
broadly supportive agar medium  and colonies of tested strains were allowed to grow on this 
medium. A positive result for the azo dye reduction  agar plate assay wa s classified as a section of 
an azo dye- containing plate where growth of a given isolate  correlated with  visual 
decolourization, indicating  that a species was  positive for azo dye reduction . Figure 2.1 
demonstrates this phenomenon using five azo dye  infused plates , including Amaranth, Allura 
Red, Sunset Yellow, Tartrazine and Evans Blue. The sections of the agar plate that show  azo dye 
reduction correlate with Veillonella  sp. strains CC7/4 MRS 1, AC2811, and 6_1_27. One section 
with no decolourization is associated with growth of Parasutterella  sp. strain CC8/2 JVN 5b, 
whereas the final section with no decolorization is an inoculated control. The  Veillonella spp. 
were able to reduce all five azo dyes tested within a 7 2 h incubation period, and were selected  for 
further study. Figure 2.1.1 shows the formation of a purple product in an aerobic environment 
following the anaerobic reduction of Tartrazine.

 Figure 2.2: Phylogenetic map constructed using 16S r RNA gene sequences  to determine 
relatedness  of over 130 tested isolates  representing six  phyla, derived from fecal microbiomes. 
Where possible, isolates related to strains that initially showed azo dye decolorization activity 
were selected from the A llen-Vercoe lab collection for testing to assess broad activity among a 
species or clade. Names of bacterial strains that reduce d azo dyes are coloured green. The ability 
to reduce azo dyes was determined fro m the assay shown in Figure 2.1.
 
 The data collected from the azo dye plate assay  (Table 2. 1 and Figure  2.2) demonstrates 
that the azo dy e most frequently reduced by gut microbiome- associated  species was  Amaranth , 
and the least frequently reduced was Tartrazine. Sunset Yellow , Evans Blue and Allura Red were 
the second, third and fourth most reduced dyes, respectively. Evans Blue was used as an 
indicator substrate since the dark blue colour contrasted well against the slight yellow colour of 
the agar plates when reduced, whereas the reduction of Tartrazine was not as distinct visually 
(Figure 2.1). It was thus theorized that Evans Blue could be used as an  indicator dye to identify 
whether  a strain has azoreductase capabilities . However , it was not reduced as frequently as 
Amaranth  in the assays performed here. Therefore,  Amaranth was determined to be the best 
identifier of whether a strain has azoreductase capabilities  (Table 2. 1).  
The reduction of the se five azo dyes was not always consistent among strains of the same 
species, for example, strains associated with species  Ruminococcus torques, Coprococcus catus, 
Enterocloster bolteae, Anaerostipes hadrus, Bacteroides kribbi, Barnesiella intestinihominis, and  
Clostridium symbiosum were not all able to produce areas of decolorization on plates . Taxa 
exhibiting high azo dye reduction activity in this survey belonged to the genera Clostridium, 
Hungatella, Enterocloster, Veillonella, Dielma, Eggerthella, Odoribacter , and Phocaeicola.  
The phylogenetic mapping of all  the species screened  for azoreductase capabilities 
(Figure 2.2) shows the genetic similarities between species with high azoreductase activity. Species that showed some azo dye reduction activities  were not all closely related , but instead 
spread across the tree. However, t here were clusters of species that reduced many azo dyes. 
Three clusters in particular fell into this category: the first included Clostridium symbiosum,  
 
  
38 
 Clostridium pac aense, Enterocloster bolteae, Enterocloster lavalensis, Hungatella effluv ii and 
Hungatella hathewayi , all of which belong to the family Lachnospiraceae, a prominent group 
within the human gut microbiome
55. The second cluster included members of the Veillonella 
genus:  Veillonella atypica, Veillonella parvula and  Veillonella dispar, as  well as  representative 
isolates of Dielma fastidiosa and Clostridium innocuum  species, belonging to the 
Erysipelotrichales  order56. The third cluster included strains associating with  Phocaeicola 
vulgatus , Barnesiella intestinihominis , and Odoribacter splanchnicus  species , which are all  
members  of the Bacteroidales  order56.  Representative strains of Eggerthella lenta, a member of 
the Eggerthellaceae group of the Actinobacteria phyla, also showed abilities to broadly reduce 
the tested azo dyes.  One strain of Akkermansia muciniphila, a  Verrucomicrobia phylum 
member, was tested in this assay , and found to reduce Amarant h.  
2.3.2 Whole B acterial C ell A zo D ye K inetics  
 A quantitative method to measure azo dye reduction was achieved by  observing dye 
reduction over a physiologically relevant time  period, as 24 hours  is the average retention time in 
the human colon 57. To do this , a plate reader assay was employed to measure absorbance at the 
appropriate wavelength for each dye during growth of selected strains  over time. Data was  
presented according to the  species ’ genetic similarities , and general patterns of reduction shown. 
The positive control is BHI medi um with azo dye present which represents the maximum 
absorbance of the dye at full saturation and the negative control is just the BHI medi um 
(absorbance with n o azo dye present ).  
The findings  of the azoreductase agar plate assay corroborate the results of the 96 -well 
whole bacterial cell azo dye kinetics. Overall, Amaranth was the most, and Tartrazine the least 
frequently reduced substrate . As seen in section 2.2.2, t here was a difference in the reduction of 
the four azo dyes between strains of the same species. This was  exemplified by strains of the 
species C. symbiosum, E. bolteae, and  B. intestinihominis .    
 
  
39 
 The C. symbiosum, strains  2 FAA S and  CC33001A  showed reduction of all four azo 
food dyes, whereas strain 7/3/54 only showed very slight reduction of Amaranth (Figure 2.3). 
The strains CC33001A and 2 FAA S showed similar dye reduction for all four of the azo dyes 
tested . There was no difference in red uction activity or rate between Amaranth and Allura Red 
substrates for these strains; for both, there was complete reduction before 10 hours of incubation. 
There was a delay in the complete reduction time for Sunset Yellow, with complete reduction for 
these strains by a bout 20 hours of incubation. Tartrazine was  the only dye that was  not 
completely reduced by these strains during the 24 h incubation time .

37°C under anaerobic conditions. The reduction of 250 μM azo dye was measured at the peak 
wavelength for A. Amaranth, B. Allura Red, C. Sunset Yellow, and D. Tartrazine.
 
 
 
  
40 
 The reduction patterns of the C. symbiosum  strains  were reflected  in the E. bolteae 
strains , where there were differences in dye reduction between strains of the same species .  Over 
the 24 h assay , the E. bolteae  strains  17 FMU and 1 GAM showed comparable reduction patterns 
with all four azo dyes, with Amaranth and Allura Red  being fully reduced in the 24 h period. 
Sunset Yellow had slight reduction while  reduction of Tartrazine was not observed (Figure 2.4 ).  
Strain EtOH30 only showed slight reduction of Amaranth, and no reduction for the other three 
azo dyes within the incubation period. This validates the plate  assay results in Section 2.2.1 
where E. bolteae  species did not reduce Tartrazine and  the only dye strain EtOH30 reduced was 
Amaranth.

41 
 The Veillonella  spp. all show ed a very rapid reduction of Amaranth as evident from the 
complet e reduction of the dye before the incubation period. Tartrazine was slightly reduced by 
strain 29 TSA during the 24 h incubation (Figure 2.5). All strains  of this genus have very similar 
dye reduction patterns; however, strains  29 TSA and OBEAV1 6 MRS, which are both V. 
atypica , showed the most variance. These results do not reflect the data shown in the plate assay, 
Section 2.2.1.

reduction of 250 μM azo dye was measured at the peak wavelength for A. Amaranth, B. Allura 
Red, C. Sunset Yellow, and D. Tartrazine.     
The Bacteroid ota strains 3 TSA, CC3/ 1 J4 and CC2/1 M7, and 21 D6 I did not show 
reduction of any of the four food azo dyes over the 24 h test  period (Figure 2.6);  the only strain 
 
 
  
42 
 of B. intestinihominis  that demonstrated azo dye reduction was OB21 FMU 25. This strain 
reduced Allura Red and Amaranth to completion, within the 24 h incubation period, with Allura 
Red being reduced in less  time. The same strain also  reduced Sunset Yellow and Tartrazine, but 
neither  dye was reduced to completion within 24 h. T he rate of reduction of Tartrazine appeared 
to be slower overall but with earlier  onset than that of Sunset Yellow (Figure 2.6).

A. Amaranth, B. Allura Red, C. Sunset Yellow, and D. Tartrazine.    
Strai ns 3BHI, 21 D6 S, 5 FAA S, 11 B D5, 2 BHI and 25 D5 S, representative of various 
species across several phyla,  were able to reduce all four of the azo dyes  within 24 h, with 
Amaranth reduction at the fastest rate, and Tartrazine at the slowest rate (Figure  2.7). St rains 25 
 
 
  
43 
 D5 S  and 5 FAA S had the shortest complete azo dye reduction times.  The strain 2 BHI had the 
most linear reduction pattern for all four azo dyes. These results matched the reduction data from 
the plate assay in section 2.2.2.

strain 25 D5 S, at 37°C under anaerobic conditions. The reduction of 250 μM azo dye was 
measured at the peak wavelength for A. Amaranth, B. Allura Red, C. Sunset Yellow, and D. Tartrazine.     
 
2.3.3 Growth C urve K inetics  
Next, it was important to determine whether growth of each isolate took place during the 
reduction assays  outlined in  Section  2.2.2. The results for the tested strains are presented  here in 
the same grouping as in Section 2.2.2, except for  D. fastidiosa  strain  2 BHI and E. lenta  strain  25 
D5 S , which were grouped with Veillonella  spp. to allow a better visualization of growth 
 
 
  
44 
 patterns ; this growth curve was included as an example, with all other growth curves included in 
Appendix 2. The positive control s for both Tartrazine and Sunset Yellow  displayed no additional  
interference at 600 nm  compared to  the negative medi um control , whereas Amaranth and Allura 
Red had a high absorbance and interference at 600 nm. The error bars represent the average of  
four technical replicates of each data point.   
The strains that showed no discerni ble growth in any medi um type were the Barnesiella 
spp. strains  CC3/1 J4, CC2/1 M7, Dielma  sp. strain 2 BHI, and Phocaeicol a sp. strain 3 TSA  
(Figure 2.8 and A ppendix 2, Figure D ); with exception to 2 BHI, this  suggests that the lack of  
azo dye reduction by these species could be caused by a lack of growth. The species 2 BHI does 
not show growth in any medi um type ; however, it was  able to reduce all four  azo dye s. The 
Barnesiella sp. strain  OB21  FMU  25 showed marginal  growth in Sunset Yellow -infused media 
and BHI media  (Appendix 2, Figure D ) this was the only strain to grow and the only strain to 
show azo dye reduction. The Odoribacter  sp. strain 21 D6 I  showed slight  growth in the BHI 
medi um only and inhibited growth in the azo dye -supplemented media  (Appendix 2, Figure  D). 
The growth of the multiple Veillonella spp. strains tested  and Eggerthella strain 25 D5 S  did not 
seem to be a ffected greatly by the azo dye supplemented media . (Figure 2. 8). 
  
 
  
45 
  
Figure 2.8: The 24 h incubation of  V. parvula strain 6_1_27, V. atypica strains 29 TSA, and 
OBEAV1 6 MRS, V. dispar strain 3_1_44, D. fastidiosa 2 BHI, and E. lenta  25 D5 S at 37°C 
under anaerobic conditions. The growth of these strains was measured in BHI or BHI  media 
supplemented with 250 μM  azo dye.  
 
 
  
46 
 All the E . bolteae strains  tested  showed suppressed growth in Sunset Yellow  
supplemented media, and very minimal growth in Tartrazine supplemented media compared to 
control (Appendix 2, Figure  B). This growth aligns with the results from  kinetics with whole  cell 
bacterial preparations, which demonstrated that these strains d id not reduce Tartrazine ( Figure 
2.4) and  corroborates the agar plate assay ( Table 2. ). Similarly, t he C. symbiosum  strains 7/3/54, 
2 FAA S and CC33001A displayed delayed growth in medi um supplemented with azo dye s 
compared to control s (Appendix 2, Figure A). Strain 7/3/54 has the slowest growth out of all the  
C. symbiosum  strains , and strain EtOH30 had the slowest growth out of all the E. bolteae  strains,  
and in  all media types  (Figure 2.3 and 2.4) . The limited growth  of these strains  may affect their  
ability to reduce the azo dyes . In Sunset Yellow medi um there was  inhibited growth of  C. 
symbiosum  strain  5 FAA S  when compared to growth in BHI  and Tartrazine. H owever , this was  
difficult to compare since the replicate error increase d after 10 hours of growth . The same strain 
grown in  the presence of  Tartrazine showed increased  growth vs. BHI (Appendix 2, Figure C) . 
The growth of  O. splanchnicus  strain 21 D6 S  was both delayed and suppressed in Tartrazine 
and Sunset Yellow compared to the control media  (Appendix 2, Figure C) .  The growth of H. 
effluvii  strain 3 BHI and C. lavalensis  11 B D5 was similar between all medium  type s (Appendix 
2, Figure C) . 
2.4 Discussion  
It is known that azo reductases  are present in some bacteria and catalyze the reduc tion of  
azo dyes . However , it has not been confirmed that these enzymes are present in commensal gut 
bacteria, and t here may be different mechanisms for azo dye  reduction  among bacterial species . 
Alternatively, if gut commensal bacterial species share similar azor eductase enzymes , then the 
mechanism of binding of the azo dye substrate could be the factor responsible for the difference s 
in substrate reduction rates  seen . The  four azo food dyes  tested in this work  have some 
similarities in structure and are sulphonated;  however, Amaranth is the only dye that has two   
 
  
47 
 fused  aromatic six membered rings on either side of the azo bond (Figure  1.5). This unique 
attribute  of Amaranth structure could thus contribute  to its  frequent and rapid susceptibility to 
reduction compared to the other  tested dyes;  for example, there may be specificity in the  
reduction of azo dyes if  the azo reduction  is caused by azoreductase enzymes  with  active sites 
that favor  the s tructure of Amaranth  compared to the other dyes. The structures of Allura Red 
and Sunset Yellow both form 1- amino -2-napht hol-6-sulphonic acid after azo bond reduction 
(Figure 2.9 ), which correlates to the similar reduction  of both of these dyes  (section 2.2.2) . From 
this work, a  relation ship has emerged between  the structure of a given azo dye and the ability of 
commensal  gut bacterial species to reduce them . One of the only azo dyes that  contains a five 
membered ring is Tartrazine, and it is possible that this structure contributed to the apparent 
difference in reduction ability and kinetics of this dye compared to the other three  azo dye s. 
Further work to identify potential azoreductases  and to obtain crystal  structure s will be required 
in order to full y characterize their  binding domains , and to determine  enzyme substrate s.  
The formation of the purple product after the aerobic incubation of reduced Tartrazine 
metabolites (Figure 2.1.1)  reflects what has been seen previously by Perez- Diaz et al . in broth 
culture , and Westöö  in rats
 30,31.  This establishes  that this product can be produced in agar when 
Tartrazine is reduced by individual bacterial species. The structure of the product was not 
identified . In future experiments , this purple product could be isolated and identified via LC -MS 
to confirm the molecular weight in relation to  Westöö’s predicted metabolite.   
 
  
48 
  
Figure 2.9: The metabolites produced from the azo reduction of the four food  azo food dyes. 
The data collected in the whole bacterial azo dye kinetics assays (Section 2.2.2) show that 
strains of the same species do not always reduce the same azo dyes. However , growth of a given 
strain  has some impact on its ability to reduce different azo dyes. F or example, the only B. 
intestinihominis  strain to show any azo dye reduction , strain OB21 FMU 25, was also the only 
strain to show growth in the test medium. The strain Odoribacter  sp. 21 D6 I showed growth, but 
not azo dye reduction, in BHI medi um, which contrasted sharply with findings from the plate 
assay which demonstrated strong azo dye reduction by this strain on FAA medium. Thus, t he 
 
 
  
49 
 medi um of growth could have caused the discrepancy in azo dye reduction seen between the 
plate assay and the w hole cell kinetics , perhaps through the upregulation of azoreductase genes 
on one medium type but not the other .  
Strains of t he species E . bolteae, C. symbiosum, and E. lavalensis  showed inhibited 
growth in the azo dye supplemented medi um. T his may  have been a result of  the reaction 
conditions in the polystyrene 96 well plate , or the azo dyes causing inhibition of growth. Al l of 
these species are from the Eubacteriales  order  which may explain the effects of the tested dyes 
on growth among these strains in the broth medium used ( Figure 2.2) . The D. fastidiosa  strain 2 
BHI does not show notable growth in BHI through the OD  600 nm readings , although its ability 
to reduce all four of the tested azo dyes is clear , Figure 2.8. However, the reduction of azo dyes 
by this strain follows a linear pattern rather than exponential , which  may reflect  the very minimal 
growth seen; use of a more optimal growth medium for this strain may have resulted in more 
rapid reduction of the azo dye s (Figure 2.7, Figure 2.8) .   
The growth of many bacterial species present in the human microbiome ha s been tested 
using the general method of measuring optical density of  bacterial  cells at 600  nm to determine 
the number of cells in a sampl e. Since optical density depends  on the size of bacterial cells, and 
the range of bacterial cell sizes among the tested strains varies considerably, growth curve data 
can only be extrapolated reliably  between the same species to determine changes  in growth 
rather than enumerated total growth. The next step in determining whether  species growth is 
affected  by the azo dye s would be to standardize strain growth in BHI medi um and test  multiple 
biological replicates rather than technical replicates. If the azo dyes  inhibit growth, then the 
mechanism of  toxicity sh ould be explored.  
Azo dye toxicity towards bacterial cells could come from  either  the parent compound or 
the metabolites of dye reduction. S unset Yellow and Tartrazine both produce sulphanilic acid as 
a reduction product (Figure 2.9). S ulphanilic acid does not readily degrade under anaerobic  
 
  
50 
 conditions and may have detrimental effects on gr owth of bacteria
58,59. Sulphanilic acid could be 
inhibiting  growth of some species, such as E. bolteae , explaining the  reduced reduction rate for 
Tartrazine and Sunset Yellow for most species. It would be interesting to see how the growth 
rate is affected by the metabolites.  This could be explored by exposing bacterial species to 
various concentrations of  e.g. sulphanilic  acid  and measuring the growth curves .  
The two strains that showed increased  growth in azo dye supplemented BHI medi um 
when compared to the control were C . innocuum  strain 5 FAA S  (Appendix 2, Figure C ) and E. 
lenta  strain 25 D5 S  (Figure 2.8) . These two species reduce d Sunset Yellow and Tartrazine 
fastest.  Azo dyes  or their metabolites may be a useful carbon source for these microbes ; 
however , that was not tested in this work. E . lenta  is well known for its ability to biotransform 
toxins , drugs  and other xenobiotics . For example,  it is able to modify  digoxin to inactivate the 
compound60. C. innocuum is generally poorly studied, and  although it is speculated to be an 
opportunistic pathogen, its biotransformative capabilities are unknown . Strains of the 
Lachnospiraceae species tested in this work, C. symbiosum , E. bolteae  H. effluvii , C. pacaense , 
and E.  lavalensis , similarly have never been tested for their biotransformative functions, 
although it has been suggested that some strains may perform bile acid tran sformations61. Dielma 
fastidiosa  does not have any known reductase, oxidase, catalase, or biotransformation activity , so 
it is surprising that such strong azo dye reduction was seen with both D ielma strains tested62.  
A previous study, conducted in 2019, identified gut bacterial species with azoreductase 
capabilities, and , similar to the work presented here , showed strains of O. splanchnicus and  P. 
vulgatus  to reduce Allura Red and Sunset Yellow54. This previous research, however, showed 
different outcomes for tested strains of species including Faecalicoccus  sp., Dorea sp., 
Coprococcus comes , Eisenbergiella, Bac teroides uniformis, Collinsella aerofaciens, Bacteroides 
fragilis and ovatus, Clostridium hyle monae, Blauti a spp. Ruminococcus faecis and 
Bifidobacterium  spp.54, compared to strains tested in the work presented here. T he differences   
 
  
51 
 could be a result of the different media components used for strain growth, or the dye 
concentration ; the assay carried out in this thesis deliberately used a higher concentration of azo 
dyes compared to the work of Zou  et al .
54, in order to  identify spe cies that have relatively high 
azoreductase capabilities . Another explanation may  be strain -to-strain variability .  
2.5 Conclusion 
The taxa exhibiting high azoreductase activity in this survey belonged to the genera 
Clostridium, Hungatella, Enterocloster, Veillonella, Dielma, Eggerthella, Odoribacter , and 
Phocaeicola. Overall,  out of the four food azo dyes tested , Amaranth was  reduced by the most 
bacterial species within the species isolated from the human gut microbiome , and Tartrazine by 
the fewest . Allura Red and Sunset Yellow have similar reduction rates; this seems to correlate to 
these dyes ’ structures . The growth of the bacterial strains that have azo dye reduction capabilities 
was affected  by the presence of Sunset Yellow and Tartrazine in the BHI medi um. T he inhibited  
growth of these species could also explain why there was less reduction of these dyes  under these 
circumstances . There could be multiple reasons for this inhibited growth, including insufficient 
nutrients in the BHI medium, and possible dye or metabolite toxicity.  If azo dyes are consumed regularly by a host, they could affect  the gut microbiome, and further work should focus on the 
response of gut microbial ecosystems to azo dyes and their reduction products.
 
 
3 Identificat ion of P utative A zoreductase E nzymes  
3.1 Introduction 
Although azo dye reduction does occur within the human gut environment, the 
mechani sms remain unclear1,3,63. Azoreductase enzymes have been identified and structurally 
characterized in many aerobes  and a few facultative anaerobes , but to date, none have been 
structurally characterized in commensal gut bacteria1,11,43. Azoreductase discovery in anaerobic  
 
  
52 
 gut microbes could be limited  by the unique conditions required for  enzyme activity  in an 
oxygen- free environment. As well, enzymes may be  cryptic , with little identity to established 
bacterial azoreductases. Finally, the reduction of azo dyes in the gut environment may take place 
through a mechanism independent of azoreductases . Identifying enzymes that have the ability to 
reduce azo dyes , at the level  demonstrated in whole bacterial cell kinetics , would support  the 
concept  that azo dye reduction in the gut microbiome is facilitated by azoreductase enzymes.  
In chapter 2, it was shown that t he Veillonella  sp. strains 6_1_27 and 3_1_44 can  reduce 
all four food azo dyes  (Section 2.3) , and these strains were thus  selected  to be screened for  
putative azoreductase enzymes . Candidate  azoreductase e nzymes present in  the genomes of  both 
strains  were identified, expressed, and purifi ed. Activity experiments were conducted to  validate 
their capacity for reducing the four azo food dyes Amaranth, Allura Red, Sunset Yellow and Tartrazine under aerobic conditions.  
3.2 Methods   
3.2.1 Identifying N ovel A zoreductase E nzymes ; Construction of E xpression P lasmid s 
 The V eillonella  sp. strains  6_1_27 and 3_1_44 have full genome sequence representation 
at a scaffold level assembly on NCBI . Database.  These genomes were screened for azoreductase 
homologues by searching through predicted NAD(P)H -dependent oxidoreductase enzymes
64. 
Known azoreductase genes, listed in Figure 3.1, were compared against the genome of strains 
3_1 _44 and 6_1_27 using protein- protein BLAST (BLASTp)64. Genes encoding possible 
azoreductase enzymes were found. The genes were synthesized by Genscript and cloned in to 
pET- 28a+ plasmids using SacI/NdeI restraction sites . The genes were expressed via a pET -28a+ 
vector, including an N -terminal poly- histidine (His 6) tag. The structures and functions of the 
proteins (and structurally similar proteins) were predicted by the software I -TASSER65 66. 
Separately, the N -terminal his -tagged human NQO1 gene (hsNQO1) ORF was cloned into a 
pET- 28b+ vect or using NdeI  restriction sites  by our collaborators in the Ryan lab67.     
 
  
53 
 3.2.2 Protein Expression and Purification  
Plasmids  were transformed (heat -shock), into chemo- competent BL21 λDE3 E. coli  cells. 
The cells were plated onto LB agar containing kanamycin (10 μg/ml) and incubated overnight at 
37°C. A representative colony was inoculated into an aliquot (3 ml) of LB medium + kanamycin, 
10 μg/ml, and incubated overnight at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm. An aliquot (1 mL) of the 
overnight culture was inoculated into LB medium (100 mL, except 250 ml for vMdaB) 
containing kanamycin (10 μg/ml) and protein expression was induced at OD600 ~0.6 by the 
addition of IPTG (final concentration, 0.5 mM). After induction, cells were grown at 18°C, 200 
rpm, for 16 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, 4,000 rpm, 15 min, at 4°C.  
The cell pellet was resuspended in  10 mL of binding buffer containing 500 mM NaCl, 5 
mM imidazole, and 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (Appendix 1) . The resuspended cells were lysed by 
sonication (20 seconds on, 30 second off ), for 10 cycles, on ice. The sonicated cells were 
centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min. Supernatants were pooled and incubated on ice for 10 min 
before protein purification. A chelating Fast Flow Sepharose column was charged with 50 mM 
nickel sulphate solution and then rinsed with binding buffer. The soluble fraction was added to 
the column, followed by 10 mL wash buffer (Appendix 1). Bound protein was eluted with 
elution buffer, 4 mL (Appendix 1). The eluat e was collected in 0.5 ml fractions. Aliquots of the 
fractions were run on 10% acrylamide SDS-PAGE and the fractions containing the protein of interest were pooled.  
3.2.3 Flavin Binding ; Desalting  
The protein of interest was incubated with 1 mM flavin (FAD or FMN) on ice , for at least 
1 h. An Econo -Pac 10DG Desalting Columns gravity- flow desalting column (Bio -rad) was 
equilibrated with 25 mM Tris -HCl, pH 7.4. Protein was added to the column, followed by 5 mL 
of 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The eluted fractions were collected and analyzed  on SDS- PAGE 
and fractions with abundant protein were pooled (Appendix 3) . An absorbance spectrum was  
 
  
54 
 recorded for analysis of final protein concentration. The flavin to protein absorbance percentage 
was calculated using 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴  % =𝐴𝐴450
𝐴𝐴280(100 ). The extinction coefficients for the putative 
azoreductase apoenzymes were predicted using ExPASy68 based on amino acid composition. 
3.2.4 Enzyme Kinetics  
All reagents were obtained from Sigma- Aldrich. The rates of substrate reduction were 
obtained by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at the absorbance peak for each azo dye (as 
stated in section 2.1.4, and at 600 nm for 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP). Kinetic 
reactions were carried out in 1 ml reaction volume, using the Cary-UV 300 spectrophotometer 
and quartz cuvettes. The reactions were set up as follows: 100 mM NaCl, 300 mM NAD(P)H, 1-
15 μg enzyme, in 25 mM Tris -HCl pH 7.4, 1 μM flavin (FAD or FMN), 40 μM dye 
substrate40,67,69 –72. Initial rates of change were determined within 1 min. DCPIP extinction 
coefficient ε 600 = 21 mM-1cm-1 69,70,73. The reaction was started by addition of enzyme. All dyes 
were prepared as 1 mM stocks in dH 2O. (Reactions with no enzyme, or no NADPH were used as 
controls ).  
3.3  Results   
3.3.1 Identification of P utative A zoreductase E nzymes from Veillonella  spp.  
Two putative azoreductase genes were present in both the 3_1_44 and 6_1_27 genomes. 
These genes were annotated by NCBI Refseq. The gene vMdaB was predicted to have similar 
function to the MdaB (Modulator of Drug Activity B) gene and to be a putative NADPH-
quinone reductase, and the second gene, vNfsB, was predicted to have a function similar to NfsB 
(Oxygen -insensitive Nitrofurazone/ Nitroreductase B) enzymes with an FMN binding region; 
Table 3.164. Enzymes with known azoreductase and NQO reductase activity were used to 
identify similar genes/proteins in the Veillonella sp. genomes, and vMdaB was identif ied as a 
possible azoreductase analog, Table 3.1. vMdaB had amino acid sequence similarities of 31%  
 
  
55 
 with efAzoR, 33% with ecAzoR, 31% with ecMdaB, 39% with paMdaB, 32% with paNQO1, 
and 32% with hsNQO1 (Figure 3.1). The vNfsB and the vMdaB sequences were aligned with 
known azoreductase and NQO enzymes and it was determined that vNfsB and vMdaB had 
sequences closer to azoreductase enzymes and NQO enzymes, respectively (Figure 3.1).

The substrate with highest specific activity for all enzymes listed in Table 3.1 was 
DCPIP. With the azo dye substrates, Amaranth, Allura Red, Sunset Yellow, and Tartrazine, 
reduction was detected but measured activity was not consistent  under the conditions in section 
3.1.4 were not obtained. The specific activity for hsNQO1 FAD (774.4 nmol min-1 mg-1) was ~4 -
fold lower than vNfsB FAD (3.28 μmol min-1 mg-1) and ~13- fold lower than vNfsB FMN (10.0 μmol 
min-1 mg-1). vNfsB with FMN had the most activity of all the flavin enzyme combinations and 
vNfsB had the second highest activity. The lowest enzyme activity with DCPIP was vMdaB. The 
vMdaB enzyme bound with FAD (138.3 nmol min-1 mg-1) had ~1.4- fold higher activity than 
with FMN (99.0 nmol min-1 mg-1).

3.4 Discussion  
The two putative Veillonella sp. azoreductase enzymes had activity with DCPIP, but no 
conclusive data was obtained for the four food azo dyes (section 3.1.4). The kinetics assays may 
not have been optimal for azo dye reduction; NAPDH was used as an electron donor and NADH 
has not been tested. Azoreductase enzymes have different hydride donor preferences, as 
described,  for example, by Ryan et al .40,67 . paAzoR1 showed preference for NADPH when 
reducing DCIP and methyl red; however, a homolog (paAzoR3) had a ~3 -fold preference for  
 
  
59 
 NADH
40. Ryan et al . also found that  substrate  activity peaks at differing salt concentr ations, 
ranging from 0.1- 1M NaCl, which may need to be optimized for each enzyme40. The reaction 
conditions used here were chosen by combining protocols from published studies of ecAzoR, 
efAzoR, paAzoR1, and hsNQO140,67,69 –72.  
Based on the predicted structure, the enzyme vMdaB has a similar fold to many known 
azoreductases (Figure 3.2), and it was determined as  most likely to be an azoreductase, among 
the annotated proteins encoded in the Veillonella  sp. genome. The sequence sim ilarity of vMdaB 
to other azoreductases is only about 30%. As with any enzyme protein, it is the tertiary structure  
- not just the amino acid sequence – that determines substrate binding64.  
The vNfsB enzyme had higher DCPIP reduction specific activity w ith either FMN or FAD 
than hsNQO1, for which DCIP is a known substrate. The enzyme ecNfsB also has DCPIP as a 
known substrate, so it was expected that the vNfsB would also be able to reduce the compound74. 
The vNfsB enzyme has ~ 3 -fold higher activity for DCPIP with bound FMN vs. FAD.  
The vMdaB enzyme has a very similar fold to hsNQO1 and, therefore, was a reasonable 
control to ensure that the purification and reaction conditions used allow for the reduction of 
DCPIP. Nevertheless, the low activity of vMdaB seen with DCPIP may mean that the 
purification conditions or reaction conditions were not optimal, and the enzyme may fold 
differently when expressed and purified under anaerobic conditions, i.e. closer to the native 
environment of the anaerobic bacteri al source. There is a slight preference for activity with FAD 
vs FMN for vMdaB. Three -dimensional structures of vMdaB and vNfsB determined by X -ray 
crystallography would facilitate understanding of the binding sites and substrate specificities of 
the enzym es.  
Most azoreductases that have been characterized and for which structures are available are 
from either aerobic or facultative anaerobes1,11,40,47,69. The putative NAD(P)H -dependent  
 
  
60 
 oxidoreductase enzymes vNfsB and vMdaB derived from Veillonella  spp., which a re obligate 
anaerobic bacteria, have been confirmed to have oxidoreductase activity with both FMN and 
FAD as cofactors and NADPH as electron donor. Brown et al . demonstrated that a broth culture  
of Veillonella parvula can reduce Tartrazine and Sunset Yellow, but the enzyme responsible was 
not identified
51. Veillonella  spp. strains 3_1_44 and 6_1_27 have azo dye reduction properties 
when grown in the presence in azo dye media (section 2.2.2). It was hypothesized that vMdaB is the enzyme facilitating azo dye reduction of Amaranth, Allura Red, Sunset Yellow, and 
Tartrazine. NAD(P)H oxidoreductase enzymes from Veillonella  sp. are functional under aerobic 
conditions, although their azoreductase activities remain to be char acterized fully.  
Our work was unable to show that this enzyme contributed to azo dye reduction under the 
tested conditions, and thus it remains unknown whether such reduction is caused by this or another, as yet determined enzyme, or another mechanism alt ogether. Another pathway for azo 
dye reduction is through hydrogen sulfide  (H
2S) reduction of azo bonds75. This possibility was 
described in the work of Wolfson et al. , where H 2S generated from cysteine metabolism was 
shown to drive the reduction of Allura Red75. It was  established  (abiotically) that two molecules 
of H 2S transfer electrons to the azo -bond sequentially, resulting in bond cleavage75.  In vitro  
experiments were conducted by growing E.  coli in LB under anoxic conditions with  no 
supplementation, or supplementation with serine or cysteine; the only condition that had 
complete azo dye reduction in  < 10 hours was with cysteine supplementation;  the conditions  with 
only E. coli  and LB showed no azo dye reduction75.  The i n vivo  experiment  involved mouse  
models given cysteine -rich diets dos ed with Allura Red ; when compared to the control , the mice 
fed Allura Red had  decreased fecal sulfide levels75. This illustrates  that, under the studie d 
conditions , cysteine drives azo dye metabolism75. This paper has brought into question whether 
the major azo dye reduction pathway is azoreductase or H 2S facilitated75.  
 
  
61 
 3.5  Conclusion 
Two putative azoreductase enzymes f rom the Veillonella  sp. 3_1_44 and 6_1_27 can reduce 
DCPIP under aerobic conditions, but did not show clear evidence of reduction of Amaranth, 
Allura Red, Sunset Yellow, or Tartrazine. The enzyme vNfsB had high specific activity for 
DCPIP, with a flavin  preference for FMN, and vMdaB had low specific activity with DCPIP and 
a slight flavin preference for FAD. The enzyme (or enzymes) that facilitates the azo dye reduction may be more cryptic that originally anticipated, or the reaction conditions may need to 
be modified in order for vMdaB or vNfsB to reduce azo dyes.  
4 Future Directions and Conclusions  
4.1 Azo D ye Metabolism in the Gut M icrobiome   
The results in this thesis demonstrate , through screening commensal human gut microbiome 
species , that Amaranth is the dye that is reduced most often, and T artrazine is the dye that is 
reduced least often ; out of the 133 isolates , 83 bacterial species tested for azo dye reduction 29 
species were identified to have the ability to reduce Amaranth and only 15 were able to reduce 
Tartrazine. The species  that demonstrated azo dye reduction belong to the multiple genera 
including Clostridium, Hungatella, Enterocloster, Veillonella, Dielma, Eggerthella, Odoribacter , 
and Phocaeicola. The g rowth of some bacterial strains was  affected by the presence of Sunset 
Yellow and Tartrazine in BHI medi um. Recently Wu et al . discovered that Tartrazine 
consumption under 10 mg/kg bw/day caused dysbiosis in the crucian carp gut microbiota63. After 
2 months of treatment the crucian carp had increased oxidative stress and a change in 
histological structure of the intestine and liver63. The microbial communities changed 
significantly from the initial composition, when T artrazine was consumed pathogenic 
microorganisms, such as Bdellovibrio  and Shewanella were increased63.  The next steps for 
investigating food azo dyes effects on microbial communities would be to simulate a human gut 
microbiome using a chemostat vessel and dose with Tartrazine to model the results of longer- 
 
  
62 
 term consumption
57. It is probable that azo dye consumption at the ADI may alter the abundance 
of certain species in a microbial community. This model could al so be used to determine if 
ingesting multiple azo food dyes causes compounding effects, since ingesting several dyes and 
food additives would closer resemble typical human food consumption models. 
Similar ly, He at al. reported that  the metabolites of  Allura Red and Tartrazine induce colitis 
in mice over -expressing IL -2320. Previous clinical trials have shown ulcerative colitis , 
inflammatory bowel, and Crohn’s disease  can be effectively treated with  IL-23 targeting 
therapies , although upregulation of  IL-23 alone has not been shown to induce colitis in mice20. 
The metabolite that induced the relapse in colitis was 1 -amino -2-naphthol -6-sulfonate  sodium 
salt, which is a metabolite of Allura Red and Sunset Yellow20. The induction of colitis by Allura 
Red did not occur when the mice were given Allura Red prior to IL -23 over -expression, this may 
suggest an immunological tolerance to Allura Red is formed. An investigation into cytokine production from Allura Red and T artrazi ne metabolites , including IL -23 provide  a deeper insight  
into whether azo dyes , or their metabolites,  play a role in stimulating inflammation . To study this 
in the conte xt of human health, Caco -2 cells could be  exposed to Allura Red, T artrazine and their 
metabolites including Westöö’s purple product , in order to test for cytokine production via an 
ELISA  assay . If azo dyes are consumed regularly by a host, they could modify the gut 
microbiome, and further work should focus on the respons e of gut microbial ecosystems to azo 
dyes and their reduction products. 
4.2  Identification of P utative A zoreductase E nzymes  
Azoreductase enzymes  have been identified in many aerobic and facultative anaerobic 
bacterial species . However , it is unlikely that these enzymes evolved to reduce azo bonds , since 
these bonds rarely occur in nature
40,67. Azoreductase enzymes belong to a superfamily of 
oxidoreductases enzymes40,67. More research into the reduction of azo dyes by oxidoreductase 
enzymes could lead to identification of new azoreductase enzymes. R eduction by azoreductase  
 
  
63 
 enzymes  may not occur under aerobic conditions, which  may require  performing kinetics assays 
in anaerobic conditions , similar to  reactions performed  with Clostridium perfringens
43,44. The 
putative Veillonella sp. azoreductase enzymes vNfsB and vMdaB could be investigated furt her 
with different reaction conditions and substrates to definitively confirm if these enzymes are able 
to reduce azo bonds. Even if either of these enzymes can reduce azo bonds, this enzyme may not 
catalyze the reduction of the four azo food dyes explored in this paper. Novel anaerobic bacterial 
species  azoreductase enzymes could be cryptic and not like  previously discovered enzymes , or 
the reaction may be facilitated by a compound like H 2S, as described by Wolfson et al .75.  
The mechanism of  azo dye reduction by commensal gut microbiota species is still  
unknown. It is important to characterize the metabolites of food colourants, and to understand 
that the products created via biotransformation can have very different chemical and 
toxicologica l properties than the original structure. The four food azo dyes, Amaranth, Allura 
Red, Sunset Yellow, and Tartrazine, are consumed daily  around the world; however, there is  still 
controversy over the safety of these dyes. Gaining knowledge of the products  of tartrazine 
metabolism and their toxicity is important for the health of humans and their microbiota .
