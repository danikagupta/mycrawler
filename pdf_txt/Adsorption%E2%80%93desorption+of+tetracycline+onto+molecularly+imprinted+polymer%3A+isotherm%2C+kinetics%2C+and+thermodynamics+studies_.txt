abstract
Molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) was obtained by the bulk polymerization method. The MIP 
was characterized by different spectroscopic techniques like a TGA, SEM, and N2 adsorption–
desorption and pHPZC. The adsorption of tetracycline (TC) onto MIP from solution was studied, in 
which the influence of pH, initial TC concentration, MIP mass, temperature, and contact time were investigated. The surface area of MIP was 172.9 m
2/g the highest removal efficiency was obtained at 
a pH of 5, MIP dose of 0.6 g/L, TC concentration of 25 mg/L, the temperature of 50°C, and reaction time of 60 min°C. The adsorption kinetic was explored and best represented by the pseudo-sec-
ond-order kinetic model and the adsorption isotherm experimental data had the best fitness with the Langmuir model, suggesting that homogeneous uptake was the principal mechanism adopted 
in the process of TC adsorption. The maximum adsorption capacity based on the Langmuir model 
was 416.5, 476.2, 588.3, and 666.5 mg/g at temperatures of 20°C, 30°C, 40°C, and 50°C, respectively. 
The thermodynamics of the adsorption indicated the endothermic and spontaneous nature of the 
process. The usability after six cycles was approved so that the adsorption capacities were associ-ated with insignificant reduction (from 153.4 (92.04%) to 140.6 mg/g (84.38)) after the employed cycles.

1. Introduction
Utilization of antibiotics for medical purpose are 
widely increased as well as are used in animal feeds 
because of disease prevention and stimulate growth [1,2]. Therefore, a major concern that has recently been raised is associated with antibiotics in water bodies [3,4]. Even at low concentrations, antibiotics could lead to creating an adverse effect on ecosystems and human beings due to bioaccumulation, chronic and acute effects, high water solubility, high persistent, bioactivity, and string effects on microbial resistance and community [5,6].
Tetracycline (TC) with a chemical formula of (C
22H24N2O8) 
has been extremely applied in human cure and livestock therapy as well as the agricultural industry [7,8]. This type of antibiotics could be used for bacterial infections like gonorrhea, acne, and infections of the urinary tract [9,10]. TC with widespread use has been classified as an emerg-ing pollutant and caught increasing concern [11]. The exis-tence of antibiotics in the environment can lead to adverse 241 A.D. Khatibi et al. / Desalination and Water Treatment 230 (2021) 240–251
influences on microorganisms and the development of 
resistant pathogens, and further, be hazardous to human 
health [12,13]. The removal of residual TC from the 
wastewater before release to the environment is necessary.
The pollution of aquatic bodies by drugs discharged 
from various activities in the Pharmaceutical industries 
is a global environmental challenge that must be resolved 
[14]. Most of these industries in third-world nations make 
little or no provision to treat their effluent before dis-
charging it [15,16].
Many treatment methods have been taken to eliminate 
antibiotics from aqueous solutions such as biological treat-ment, electrochemical process, coagulation– precipitation, 
ion-exchange, adsorption, membrane process, and pho-tocatalysts [17,18]. It appears that the common biological methods could not sufficiently remove pharmaceutical 
compounds [19]. Due to the concentration of TC anti-
biotics at mg/L level in wastewater, the adsorption is 
appropriate for the remediation of the polluted water 
containing the low concentration of the pollutants [20,21]. Adsorption technique among others is identified as the com-
monest method used in the decontamination of antibiotics 
in discharged effluents [22]. Some of its economic and 
technological advantages are, it is cheap and easy to oper -
ate, accessible and available, profitable and efficient, and effective than other techniques [23].
Because of the complexity of environmental samples, 
molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) have been recently established for enhancing the selectivity of analytical meth-ods [24]. The designing MIPs is in such a way that can improve their selectivity for a special structure. These poly-
mers have various applications [25]. Producing the MIP is 
including the polymerization of suitable functional mono-
mer and cross-linker in the presence of a template molecule, which is carrying out by an initiator [26]. The template is finally rinsed by an appropriate solvent for creating the 
cavities in the polymer [24]. The various cases, that is, ease 
of preparation, stability at extremes of pH and tempera-
ture, high selectivity, and low operational cost are consid-ered as the advantages of MIPs. The mentioned advantages have provoked the researchers to define different applica-
tions, for example, their employment in adsorption and 
extraction of pharmaceuticals [27]. The application of MIPs 
for the extraction of pharmaceuticals has been previously studied; for instance, it has been employed for selective extraction of antiviral and non-steroid anti-inflammatory 
pharmaceuticals [28].
MIP , as a useful adsorbent material, has played a cru-
cial role in the decontamination of antibiotics in an aque-
ous environment. Its usage as an adsorbent comes with many advantages such as high renewable, very good affin-
ity, non-toxic and it can be regenerated at a very low cost. 
This material is available in large quantity and also has a 
high surface area [24,25].
The objective of this work is to investigate the poten-
tial and adsorption efficiency of MIP for the removal of 
TC from aqueous solutions. The MIP was characterized 
in terms of surface areas and morphology. The effects of 
operational parameters such as pH, amount of MIP , initial 
TC concentration, temperature, and contact time on the adsorption of TC onto MIP were analyzed to determine the factors controlling the rate of adsorption. Langmuir, 
Freundlich, Temkin, and Dubinin–Radushkevich (D–R) 
isotherm models were studied to understand the adsorp-
tion process. Kinetic studies were also evaluated using 
pseudo-first-order (PFO), pseudo-second-order (PSO), and intraparticle diffusion (IPD). Thermodynamic parameters 
were also determined.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Chemicals and reagents
Analytical grade TC (formula: C
22H24N2O8, molar mass: 
444.4 g/mol) was used in this research for the prepara-
tion of TC solution used for experimental adsorption and 
were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). A stock solu-tion containing 1,000 mg/L was prepared by dissolving 1 g 
of analytical grade TC with distilled water in a 1 L stan-
dard flask. TC solution of different initial concentrations 
(10–100 mg/L) were obtained by diluting stock solution. All 
chemicals and reagents such as NaH
2PO4, orthophosphoric 
acid, pyrrole, iron(III) chloride, NaNO3, methanol, and HCl 
and NaOH were obtained from Merck Company (Germany). The chemical structure of TC was represented in Fig. 1.
2.2. Batch adsorption technique
Batch adsorption techniques were performed to 
study the consequence of limitations such as MIP mass, ini-
tial TC concentration, contact time, solution pH, and tem-
perature for the exclusion of TC by MIP . Stock solutions 
of TC (1,000 mg/L) were prepared by dissolving an accu-
rate quantity of TC individuals. Deionized water was used 
in preparing the stock solutions and also throughout the 
experimental analysis.
The process was approved by shaking 100 mL coni-
cal flasks containing 0.6 g of MIP and 50 mL of TC solu-
tions of anticipated concentration with attuned pH 
using a shaker water bath at a continuous speed of 
180 rpm. To observe the effect of adsorbent dose on TC 
adsorption, different amounts of MIP (varying from 0.1 
to 1 g/L) were, respectively, added into the initial con-
centration of TC (100 mg/L) at 30°C and the desired pH 
until the equilibrium time was reached. By varying the 
pH from 3 to 11, the effect of pH on TC adsorption was

studied and modified to the desired value using 0.1 mol/L 
HCl and 0.1 mol/L NaOH solutions. The supernatant solution was separated from the adsorbent by a centri-fuge at 3,000 rpm for 5 min at the end of the adsorption cycle. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC; Agilent, USA, 1260 Infinity II) with UV/vis CE 4900 as a detector was used for the analysis of TC concentration column (Germany), C18 (250 mm × 4.6 mm) was used in this way. The volume of injection and wavelength of measurement was 20 μL and 288 nm. The orthophos-phoric (65%) and buffer 96.65% (NaH
2PO4) were applied 
as a mobile phase. Eq. (1) was used to measure the percentage of TC removal (R ) [29]:

where C0 (mg/L) and Ce (mg/L) are TC concentrations ini-
tially and at time t, respectively.
For the adsorption process, TC solutions of differ -
ent concentrations (25–100 mg/L) for TC were agitated 
with 0.6 g of MIP until the equilibrium was achieved. Equilibrium adsorption capacity, q
e (mg TC per g MIP) 
was designed from Eq. (2) [30]:
qVC C

where V (L) is the volume of solution and W (g) is the 
weight of MIP .
pHPZC is determined to detect the type of interac-
tions, which occur between MIP and charged soluble species; the procedure of its determination is described as follows: first, we prepared a stock solution of 0.1 M NaNO
3 using distilled water. After that, this solution 
was employed to prepare ten different solutions with pH values (2–11); the adjustment of the pH of these solu-tions has been carried out using either 0.1 mol/L HCl and 0.1 mol/L NaOH. We then poured 0.1 g MIP in 50 mL of each solution and left them to being stirred for 24 h. Lastly, we measured the final pH and plotted 
it as a function of the initial pH of the solution.
2.3. Synthesis of polymers
The MIP was obtained as the process described by 
Cromack and the bulk polymerization method [31]. One  
300 mg or mmol of the template and 4 mmol of pyrrole 
were dissolved in 40 mL of a solution containing 3 vol-umes of methanol and 2 volumes of water. The resulting 
solution was stirred for half an hour. 9.2 mmol of iron(III) 
chloride was added to the solution as an oxidizer and 
stirred for another half an hour. The polymerization was 
then finalized in an argon atmosphere (oxygen plays a strong inhibitory role in the polymerization process) 
without stirring for 72 h. The obtained MIP was washed 
using a vacuum system, filtered, and then washed with dis-
tilled water to remove residual iron and other impurities 
and dried at room temperature. Non-imprinted polymer (NIP) was synthesized similarly to the above method with-out the presence of the target molecule. The obtained MIP was completely ground and milled by a mortar. The target 
molecule was completely removed and extracted by the 
Soxhlet process in methanol. To ensure complete removal 
of the template, the solution inside the balloon was sam-pled and analyzed by HPLC during Soxhlet. After com-plete removal of the template, the mixture was filtered 
and dried in a vacuum oven at 70°C.
The characterization of the MIP and NIP was tested 
by a scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffrac-
tion (XRD), and thermogravimetric (TGA) analysis. The specific surface areas of the MIP and NIP were measured 
by N
2 adsorption–desorption at 77 K and determined by 
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. MIP characterization
This phenomenon was further confirmed by the data 
of specific surface areas obtained from the BET method. 
The specific surface areas of the MIP and NIP were calcu-lated to be 172.9 and 97.2 m
2/g. The specific surface areas 
of the MIP were identified to be almost 1.8 times compared to the NIP . It may be accredited to the fact that MIP has a template during synthesis, and the template is removed during its washing. Washing of the MIPs is led to remov-ing the template from the surface of the pores however this process has not occurred for NIP; this resulted in enhancing the surface area of the MIP . This facilitates the adsorption of the antibiotic on the MIP surface. Since the pore diameter of both MIP and NIP is higher than 50 nm, their surface is macro-porous. The pore volume for MIP and NIP were obtained at 0.276 and 0.241 cm
3/g, respectively.
The morphology of synthesized polymer was surveyed 
using the results of SEM. According to the results of this analysis provided in Fig. 2, MIP has a rougher surface in comparison with the NIP (it has a smooth surface); this results in providing a higher surface area for adsorp-tion. The difference in morphology spotted in the image of MIP , compared to NIP , may be described by the pres-ence of a template during the synthesis of the polymer and its washing.
The thermal stability of the polymer was estimated 
using TGA analysis, and the results of this analysis are publicized in Fig. 3. This Fig. 3 highlights the lack of weight loss in polymer by increasing the temperature of 100°C–300°C. While increasing the temperature to values higher than the mentioned range will lead to rapid decom-position of polymer, which may be related to the struc-tural difference created during removal of the template. The occurrence of a rapid weight loss has been detected at temperatures range of 350°C–500°C. Moreover, Fig. 3 indi-cates that, at a temperature higher than 500°C, the poly-mer is absolutely decomposed. According to the above, good thermal stability for synthesized polymer could be observed at temperatures lower than 300°C.
To acquire information on the crystallinity of the 
homogenized powder sample, the XRD result (Fig. 4) can be valuable. Considering the results represented in 243 A.D. Khatibi et al. / Desalination and Water Treatment 230 (2021) 240–251
Fig. 4, the similarity in the pattern of MIP and NIP can be 
detected; this signposts that there is the same structural backbone in their structure. Moreover, the XRD peak could not provide any evidence for the absence of crystallin-ity and the amorphous nature of the polymer. This result was observed to be in agreement with the results of a similar study [32].
3.2. Effect of MIP weight
As mentioned before, MIP used in the present waste-
water treatment survey to study the effect of weights 
in the removal % of TC from the aqueous solution. 
Various weights including 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 
0.07, 0.08, 0.09, and 0.1 g of MIP used in batch adsorptive 
removal experiments in 100 ml aqueous solutions con-taining 100 mg/L of TC (Fig. 5). The pH of the solutions 
was kept at 7. The obvious obtained result of the param-
eter was that as the adsorbent weight in the contami-
nated solution was increased, the TC concentration of the 
solutions was decreased. So the obtained removal % was enhanced. This is due to the fact that adding more amount 
of adsorbent in solution provides more surface area for

the adsorption of the pollutant and consequently the 
removal % is enhanced [33]. This phenomenon is observ-able until a weight that the system reaches an equilibrium. So adding an extra amount of adsorbent will not be effi-cient for increasing the removal %. According to the per -
formed experiments, the optimum amount of MIP was turned out to be 0.6 g.
3.3. Effect of pH and determination of point of zero charge
TC is a hydrophilic amphiphilic molecule with a vari-
ety of functional groups, and there are three ionization 
equilibrium constants in an aqueous solution, namely pK
1 = 3.30, pK2 = 7.68, and pK3 = 9.68 [34]. Therefore, under 
different pH conditions, TC can be dissociated into four different forms, namely TC
+, TC0, TC−, and TC2−. The effect 
of the solution pH on the adsorption capacity is shown in 
Fig. 6. The results show that the adsorption capacities of 
MIP were higher when the pH of the solution was neutral, but the adsorption capacities of MIP were lower under the condition of strong alkalinity [35].
MIP pH
PZC was originated to be 7.2 (Fig. 7). When 
the pH of the solution is less than that of the adsorbent pHpzc, the adsorbent will be protonated and positively 
charged and easily adsorb negatively charged substances. 
In contrast, when the pH of the solution is greater than 
that of the adsorbent pHpzc, the polar functional groups 
of the adsorbent will be dissociated and negatively charged [36]. However, TC exists in the form of TC
+ 
under acidic conditions and TC− and TC2− under alka-
line conditions. Therefore, the adsorption performance of the adsorbent decreased under the action of electro-static repulsion. When the pH was between 5 and 7, the primary existence form of TC was TC
0 with almost no 
charge. Therefore, the change in pH had little impact on the adsorption performance. In this range, the adsorption amount was large, indicating that there were non-elec-trostatic interactions such as π–π accumulation and hydrogen bonding between the MIP and the TC [37].
3.4. Equilibrium studies
It provides fundamental information on the adsorp-
tion mechanism, surface properties, and the affinity of 
adsorbents, which helps to determine the application of 
adsorption as a unit operation [37]. The results obtained on 
the adsorption of TC onto MIP were tested by different iso-
therm models as follows.
3.4.1. Langmuir model
This model assumes that the adsorption occurs at spe-
cific homogenous active sites on the adsorbent. These 
active sites have an affinity for adsorption of a monolayer and there is no interaction between adsorbed molecules. The linear form of Langmuir equation is expressed as [38,39]:
C
qk qC
qe
eL me
m/g32/g141 (3)
where qe is the amount of TC adsorbed and has the units 
of mg/g, qm is the maximum holding power of the MIP 
when the adsorbent superficial layer is saturated by the adsorbate which has the units of mg/g and k
L is a constant 
related to the Langmuir equilibrium, kL is dependent on 
the adsorbed energy and has the units of L/mg and the plot of C
e/qe vs. Ce (Fig. 8a) gives a straight line in which 1/qmax 
and kL are computed.
3.4.2. Freundlich isotherm
Freundlich isotherm assumes that the adsorption of 
the adsorbate toward the adsorbent is through the multi-
ple surfaces located at both the interior and exterior layers 
of the adsorbent which is generally referred to as a het-erogeneous distribution, the linear form of the Freundlich 
isotherm is [40]:

and 1/n  is a function of the potential of the adsorbate to 
adhere to the adsorbent surfaces, a plot of logqe vs. logCe 
(Fig. 8b) is plotted in which the values of 1/n  and KF are 
computed from slopes and intercepts, respectively.
3.4.3. Temkin isotherm
Temkin adsorption isotherms are based on the assump-
tion that the heat of adsorption decreases with reference 
to the increase in adsorbent coverage. The linear form of Temkin isotherm is [41]:
qB AB Cee/g32/g14ln ln  (5)
where B = (RT /b), b is Temkin constant which is linked to 
the heat of sorption, A is Temkin isotherm constant, T is the absolute temperature in kelvins, and R is the molar 
gas constant and a plot of q
e vs. lnCe (Fig. 8c) was drawn 
and the values of B and A were computed from slopes and intercepts, respectively.
3.4.4. D–R isotherm
The D–R model is expressed as Eq. (6) [42]:
ln lnqq Kem/g32/g16 /g722 (6)
where K indicates the adsorption energy constant, qm rep-
resents the theoretical saturation capacity (mg/g), and ε is 
the Polanyi potential, calculated from Eq. (7) [43]:/g72/g32 /g14/g167
/g169/g168/g168/g183
/g185/g184/g184RTCln11
eq (7)
where Ceq (mol/L) is the equilibrium concentration of adsor -
bate. The constant K is expressed by the slope of the plot of 
lnqe vs. ε2 (Fig. 8d), and the adsorption capacity, qm (mg/g) was 
represented by the intercept.
The mean free energy of adsorption, E (kJ/mol), was cal-
culated using Eq. (10) [44]:
EK/g32/g16/g11/g12/g16212/ (8)
From the comparison of the regression coefficients it 
was found that Langmuir > D–R  > Freundlich > Temkin  
(Table 1 and Figs. 8a–d). On the basis of the comparison of q
e values calculated, there was an insignificant dis-
parity between qe values from the Langmuir model and 
the experimental values, whereas there was an obvious gap of q
e values from D–R model with the experimen-
tal values, illustrating that Langmuir fits better than D–R model. Therefore, adsorption of TC using MIP can best be described by the Langmuir model and consequently an indication that single layer adsorption was predominant.
The value of E calculated using above Eq. (9) at low 
temperatures is less than 8 and this implies that the type of adsorption involved in this study is physiosorp-tion (physical sorption), but at higher temperatures the 00.050.10.150.20.250.3

value of E increases to higher than 8 and the adsorption  
is chemical.
The adsorption capacity (qm) values of various adsor -
bents and MIP were compared for TC adsorption. 
There are significant differences between the qm values 
of different adsorbents as shown in Table 2. The results 
in Table 2 show that MIP has an average good ability to adsorb TC from an aqueous solution.3.5. TC adsorption kinetics
The investigation of kinetic data is extremely relevant 
to the adsorption operation by providing information on the possibility of applying a particular adsorbent, the time required for the process to reach equilibrium, the mass transfer parameters, and about adsorption rate. The kinetic behavior of TC adsorption on MIP was evaluated employing

adsorption capacity curves (qt) as a function of contact time 
(t) varying between 10 and 120 min, for different initial TC 
concentrations. The kinetic profile is illustrated in Fig. 9. 
As shown in Fig. 9, at the initial stage adsorption capacity show a rapid increase with time up to saturation capacity at 30 min, after that, the adsorption capacity became slow and significantly constant at 60 min. Rapid increase at the onset of the adsorption process may be attributed to high solute concentration gradient as well as vacant pore voids [45]. However, the contact time increased and adsorption capacity slows down, this is because the available adsorp-tion sites is been occupied [46]. The movement of TC into the pore surface will be slow due to the few sites available; this will continue until equilibrium is achieved.
Different adsorption kinetics models such as PFO, PSO, 
and IPD kinetic model were used for reviewing the kinet-ics models that best fit with the adsorption of TC onto MIP adsorbents. Eqs. (9)–(11) in order to represent the PFO, PSO kinetics model, and IPD model, respectively [47–49].

rate constant, and K3 represents the IPD propagation 
rate constant. I is a constant and is associated with the thickness of the boundary layer.
The rate constants and the correlation coefficients were 
calculated and summarized in Table 3. The value of the correlation coefficient R
2 for the PSO adsorption model 
was relatively high (>0.993) at all concentrations. Also, qe 
(calculated) using the PSO model is equal to that obtained 
experimentally. These values indicated that adsorption fol-
lows the PSO mechanism. Also, the plot (Fig. 10) of t/qt vs. t 
for PSO showed a linear relationship between t/qt and t.
The theoretical adsorption capacities predicted by 
the PSO model were 46.9 mg/g (25 mg/L), 93.45 mg/g (50 mg/L), 136.9 mg/g (75 mg/L), 185.1 mg/g (100 mg/L), and agreed well with the experimental values. Similar to that observed in Table 3, it can be highlighted that the the-oretical capacities increased with the increase of the initial concentration, confirming that the TC adsorption capacity was favored in higher concentrations.
The IPD model was usually used to assess the diffu-
sion mechanism during the adsorption kinetic process. The fitting curves of the IPD model for TC occurred in two linear steps (Fig. 11 and Table 3), illustrating that the diffusion mechanism of this process could be described as two separate stages. The first sharp stage through a transfer of the antibiotics from the solution to the sur -
face of sorbent was caused by the interactions between the antibiotics and the active binding sites of the MIP , and by the formation of the external surface transport

driven by the large concentration gradients of the TC [50]. 
The second gentle stage illustrated the gradual decrease of adsorption rates until reaching equilibrium stage due to the low residual concentrations of adsorbate in the solution, and a small amount of active binding sites remained on the MIP surface in which IPD of the TC into pores of the MIP started to become the rate-limiting step [51]. Thus, the overall adsorption of TC by the MIP was jointly controlled by IPD and external mass transfer.
3.6. Effect of temperature and thermodynamic study
The effect of temperature (20°C–50°C) on TC adsorp-
tion was evaluated at pH of 5, initial TC concentration 
of 100 mg/L, and MIP mass 0.6 g/L, and the results are 
shown in Fig. 12. It can be seen that by increasing the tem-
perature from 20°C to 50°C, the adsorption capacity was 
increased from 148.5 to 165.5 mg/g.
This could be as a result of the increase in kinetic 
effect, thus leading to increased mobility of the adsor -
bates molecule as temperature increased [52]. The high 
adsorption recorded indicates the process is endothermic. 
A further increase in temperature beyond 30°C had an insignificant effect. The removal percentage of increased 
gradually to reach the percentage removal of 99.57% at 50°C.
Thermodynamic parameters such as standard Gibbs 
free energy change (∆G °), enthalpy change (∆H °), and 
entropy change (∆S °) at equilibrium at different tem-
peratures can be calculated from the Langmuir isotherm equation as the following equations [53,54]:
/g39GR TK /g113/g32/g16 ln  (12)
lnKS
RH
RT0/g32/g113/g16/g113 /g39/g39 (13)
where K (L/mol) is the Langmuir constant. Thermodynamic 
conditions will give more information on the reaction 
mechanism and sorption process (Table 4). The value 
of ΔH ° change is positive, which indicates an endother -
mic process. The enthalpy of TC onto MIP are 41.75 kJ/
mol. This suggests that the interaction of TC ions with MIP is endothermic [55]. The value of ΔS ° is positive 
(0.195 kJ/mol K). This signifies a strong affinity of ions 
for adsorbents and a high degree of randomness [56]. The value of ΔG ° is negative (–15.37 to –21.26), and it mea-
sures the spontaneity of a reaction process. From Table 4, it can be seen that as temperature increased from 293 
to 323 K, the free energy increased (become more neg-
ative). This indicates a favorable and energetically spon-
taneous reaction [57]. The analysis shows the process was characterized by high randomness and spontaneous  
endothermic.
3.7. Regeneration and reuse of the adsorbent
The feasibility of reusing an adsorbent is correlated to 
its regeneration capacity. It is an important aspect of the 
economic perspective of the operation by enabling the pro-longed use of the material [58]. The potential for regener -
ation and proposed reuse for the adsorbent was explored for six consecutive cycles. Fig. 13 shows the behavior of the adsorption capacity of the MIP during each of the adsorption/regeneration cycles. According to the results, it can be observed that the material preserved its adsorptive capacity in the first two cycles of use. From the first use (153.4 mg/g) to the sixth reuse (140.6 mg/g), and the capacity reduction was approximately 8.3%. Therefore, these results indicate that the MIP , besides being efficient in removing TC in an aqueous solution, is also viable in reusing and maintaining a remarkable adsorption capacity at least six regeneration cycles.

3.8. Competitive adsorption experiments
For conducting competitive adsorption experiments, 
MIP (0.6 g/L) was poured into a mixed solution contain-
ing TC, ciprofloxacin (CIP), and amoxicillin (AMO) ions. 
The related experiments were carried out using indi-vidual concentrations of 100 mg/L, pH of 5, the temperature of under 303 K, and contact time of 60 min. Using Eq. (14), 
the selectivity coefficient (K ) was calculated [59]:
Kqq
CCxa
xa=/
/ (14)
In Eq. (15), the adsorption capacity of X  ions in the 
mixed solution has been shown qx (mg/g); qa (mg/g) is indic-
ative of the total adsorption capacity of the rest of the ions 
in the mixed solution, Cx (mg/g) represents the initial con-
centration of X  ions in the mixed solution, and Ca (mg/g) 
is the initial concentration of the rest of the ions in the mixed solution.
The results related to the adsorption capacity of the 
MIP for TC, CIP , and AMO ions at different times have been reported in Fig. 14. The order of adsorption capacity of the tested ions was detected as follows: TC > CIP  > AMO; this indicative of a high adsorption selectivity for TC on MIP . Moreover, K  values observed for the adsorbents to 
TC can attain about 2.96 in 60 min; this value was 2.5 times 
higher to compared values obtained for CIP and 3.4 times 
greater to values compared to AMO. Choosing TC removal 
in the presence of competitive ions may be due to two pos-
sible reasons; one of these reasons may be related to the size of TC, which is exactly equal to the cavities of the MIP [60]. 
Another reason may be described by the coordination geom-
etry selectivity, which may play an imperative role since 
the ligand groups are organized by the TC-MIP sorbent in 
a way, which is essential for the suitable coordination of TC. In other words, the detected imprinting effect is governed 
by the shape and functionality of the imprinting template. 
Thus, according to the results, it can be concluded that the 
selective separation of TC by imprinted sorbent is success-
fully possible even in the presence of other ions [35].
4. Conclusion
The MIP was successfully prepared by a one-pot 
bulk polymerization method and used in the removal 
of TC from aqueous environments. MIP specifications were determined using XRD, TGA, SEM, and BET anal-ysis. The results revealed that the removal percentage of TC onto MIP was enhanced with increasing contact time, temperature, and MIP dose, but it was also reduced with increasing initial concentration and solution pH. The pro-posed MIP exhibited a rapid adsorption rate (60 min) and 
high adsorption capacity. In the adsorption isotherm, the Langmuir model was best fitted with the experimental data indicating the homogeneous nature of binding sites in the adsorbent. The PSO equation was found to be the best-fitting model for the experimental data of TC ions adsorption. The thermodynamic parameters indicated that the adsorption process was spontaneous and endother -
mic. The MIP may be used as an effective adsorbent for the selective uptake of TC ions from the aqueous solutions.
