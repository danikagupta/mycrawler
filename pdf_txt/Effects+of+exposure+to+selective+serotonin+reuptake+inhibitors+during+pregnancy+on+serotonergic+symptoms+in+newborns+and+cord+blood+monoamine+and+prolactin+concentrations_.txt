Exposure to serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) antidepressant
medication during the late gestational period has been associated
with an increased risk of lower birth weight, respiratory distress,
seizures, jitteriness and irritability in up to 30% of exposed in-fants, compared with early prenatal exposure.
1–4However, the
effects of the SRI medication on neonatal outcomes are con-founded by prenatal exposure to depressed maternal mood, anddistinguishing this influence from the effects of SRI antidepres-sants has been challenging.
5The study reported here was under-
taken to examine the impact of the timing and duration ofgestational SRI exposure using population health data linkingrecords of maternal prescriptions for an SRI medication dispensed
during pregnancy with records of maternal mental health and
neonatal outcomes, accounting for maternal illness severity. Weexpected that late (prolonged exposure including the third
trimester) gestational SRI exposure would be associated with
increased neonatal risks compared with early (first and secondtrimester)
2gestational exposure, even when controlling for
characteristics of maternal illness severity.
Method
This study was undertaken with approval from the University ofBritish Columbia Research Ethics Board, the Children’s and
Women’s Health Centre of British Columbia Research Review
Committee, the British Columbia Ministry of Health, and theBritish Columbia College of Pharmacists.
Data-set compilation
Data used in this study came from five administrative sources
housed in the British Columbia Linked Health Database (registry
of births, hospital separation records, physician billing records andthe registry of Medical Services Plan subscribers),
6linked toPharmaNet, a province-wide network record of all prescriptionsdispensed by British Columbia pharmacists. Individuals on all files
are identified with an encrypted personal health number (PHN).
The data were processed and linked by the Centre for HealthServices and Policy Research (CHSPR) at the University of British
Columbia, as described in an earlier paper.
5The CHSPR replaced
the encrypted PHN with an anonymised study ID. Diagnosis of
maternal mood was obtained from Ministry of Health MedicalServices Plan (MSP) ICD–9 diagnostic codes that referred to
depression.
7A total of 203 520 registered live births in British
Columbia occurred between 1 April 1997 and 31 March 2002.
Of these, 200 291 (98.4%) had a valid study ID that was linked
to the mother’s study ID and 192 725 (96.2%) of these records
unambiguously matched hospital birth records. Of these records,1259 were dropped because they did not report a gestational age.
Another 13 records (less than 0.01%) were dropped because they
reported estimated gestational ages less than 22 weeks on thehospital separation record. Eight records (again less than 0.01%)
with reported gestational ages greater than 43 weeks were top-
coded at 43 weeks. Hospital separation records also contain upto 16 diagnostic/procedure codes that are provided by the physi-cian attending during the neonatal period. Physicians entered at
least one ICD–9 diagnostic code for 40 733 (34%) and at least
two diagnostic codes for 27 192 (23%) of the births.
To match maternal prescription records in the PharmaNet
database, we restricted our analysis to records of neonates withan estimated date of conception between 1 January 1998 and 26March 2001, reducing our sample to 120 702. To ensure that
babies with long hospital stays were not underreported in our
sample, we restricted our analysis to those with dates of concep-tion before 26 March 2001, allowing 90 days between the lastexpected birth date and the last hospital separation date of 31
March 2002. After removing 87 records with data entry errors
and 1068 records for multiple births, the study population

Background
Late-gestational serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) exposure
has been linked to adverse neonatal outcomes; however, the
impact of timing and duration of exposure is unknown.
Aims
To determine whether late-gestational exposure to an SRI is
associated with increased risk of adverse neonatal outcome
relative to early exposure.
Method
Population-based maternal and neonatal health records were
linked to prenatal maternal prescription records for an SRI
medication ( n=3500).
Results
After controlling for maternal illness and duration of
exposure, using propensity score matching, neonataloutcomes did not differ between late and early exposure
(P40.05). After controlling for maternal illness, longer
prenatal exposure increased the risks of lower birth weight,
respiratory distress and reduced gestational age ( P50.05).
ConclusionsUsing population health data, length of gestational SRIexposure, rather than timing, increased the risk for neonatal
respiratory distress, lower birth weight and reduced
gestational age, even when controlling for maternal illnessand medication dose. These findings highlight the importance
of distinguishing the specific impact of medication exposure
from exposure to maternal illness itself.

https://doi.org/10.1192/bjp.bp.107.037101  Published online by Cambridge University Presscomprised records related to 119 547 live births. To these records
we linked information about maternal prescriptions for all records
for SRI antidepressants, other antidepressants, benzodiazepinesand antipsychotic medications dispensed between 1 January1998 and 31 March 2002. This was derived from 363 641 records
with 915 distinct drug identity numbers; 98% of these records had
a unique combination of date, drug identification number andstudy ID, leaving 356 727 prescriptions. The file identified the
drug by brand name and generic name, the date that the drug
was dispensed and the number of days supplied, together withthe unique study number for the mother. From the total
356 727 prescriptions we identified 75 456 prescriptions for SRIs,
specifically citalopram (2.7%), fluoxetine (24.6%), fluvoxamine(4.5%), paroxetine (38.9%), sertraline (22.7%) and venlafaxine
(6.6%). Prenatal exposure occurred if the period from the date
the drug was dispensed until that date plus the number of daysfor which the drug was supplied overlapped with the pregnancy.We excluded the date of birth from the pregnancy to eliminate
drugs dispensed after the infants’ birth.
Information on medical histories, including diagnosis of
maternal mood both during pregnancy and in the 12 monthsbefore conception, was obtained from the Ministry of Health
Medical Services Plan billing records. Infant birth date and lengthof gestation from the hospital discharge record enabled us to
calculate the dates of pregnancy. In the construction of the
variable for the number of days on which an SRI was taken duringpregnancy, double counting was eliminated by first identifying thedays covered by any prescription for an SRI and then summing the
days. The implicit assumption was that when prescriptions
overlapped it was because physicians had prescribed a differentSRI to replace one that had not been suitable for that patient.
Study group identification
The date of conception was estimated using the date of birth and
gestational age provided in the hospital record. The first trimester
was from the estimated date of conception to day 92 of thepregnancy. The second trimester was from day 93 to day 185
(or birth, whichever came first) and the third trimester was from
day 186 to birth. Using Chambers’ definition of exposure,
2we
assigned to the early exposure group infants of mothers who dis-continued the drug in the first and/or second trimester and never
resumed taking it. A late exposure (i.e. prolonged late-gestational
exposure) group included infants of mothers who had received aprescription for an SRI during the first and/or second trimester
and continued to take the drug into the third trimester (at least
185 days of gestation).
Neonatal outcome
On the basis of previous work,
2four key neonatal outcomes were
identified: birth weight (in grams, and incidence of birth weight
less than the 10th percentile for gestational age); percentage born
with a gestational age below 37 weeks; length of stay in hospital
greater than 3 days; and incidence of adverse neonatal symptoms(respiratory distress, jaundice, convulsions, feeding difficulties).
Data analysis
Two approaches to data analysis were used. Propensity score
matching was used to control for potential confounding variables
such as duration of exposure and maternal characteristics thatmight reflect the severity of mental illness in our analysis of the
effects of early and late exposure on these outcomes. Logistic
regression was used to estimate the relationship between durationof exposure and the same outcomes, again controlling for possibleconfounding variables. For both techniques the following
maternal characteristics (pre-pregnancy and prenatal) were
controlled for:
(a) Pre-pregnancy characteristics (the year before becoming preg-
nant): number of visits to a psychiatrist; number of times
diagnosed as depressed; number of times receiving a three-digit ICD–9 code that included reference to a depression-
related diagnosis; number of times diagnosed as having a
mental health disorder other than depression; number oftimes provided counselling by a general practitioner;
number of visits to a physician; income decile; and drugs
subsidised.
(b) Prenatal characteristics (during pregnancy): maternal age
during pregnancy; number of prenatal visits; diagnosed asdepressed; diagnosed with a three-digit ICD–9 code thatincluded reference to a depression-related diagnosis; number
of times diagnosed as depressed; number of treatments by a
psychiatrist; filled a prescription for an antipsychotic drug;and filled a prescription for a tricyclic antidepressant.
Propensity score matching
To account for the potential confounding influences of these
differences in maternal characteristics (see ‘Data analysis’),
propensity score matching
8,9was undertaken to identify a sub-
group of women in the early exposure group who were matched
for characteristics with women in the late exposure group.
Propensity score matching was carried out in three stages. First,the parameters of a model predicting SRI exposure were estimated
using maximum likelihood probit analysis. Second, these para-
meters were used to calculate the propensity score for eachindividual in our sample. Third, for each late-exposed mother,an early-exposed mother with a similar propensity score was
selected for comparison purposes, without replacement. We used
Stata SE version 9 for Windows for the first two steps and FoxProversion 9 for the third step. In this way each infant with late
exposure was compared with an infant with early exposure with
a mother with similar characteristics.
Probit regression
Multivariate regression models were used to study relationships
between risk of adverse neonatal outcome and intensity of prena-
tal exposure in terms of days of exposure and dosage. To account
for the possible impact of maternal illness severity a number of keymaternal variables reflecting illness severity were added to the
model. A major challenge in studying the relationship between
risk of adverse neonatal outcome and length of prenatal exposurearises because each are highly interrelated – the length of gestation
can affect the duration of exposure, and duration of exposure can
affect the length of gestation. To isolate the effect of exposure onlength of gestation we restricted our sample to the 97% of motherswith gestation lasting more than 244 days and limited our analysis
to exposure that occurred at some point during the first 244 days
of gestation. Although this method could introduce bias (i.e. ifbabies with longer exposure had shorter gestations, resulting in
neonates with longer exposures being disproportionately with-
drawn from the sample) we believe that the bias would be smallbecause few babies in our sample were born at less than 35 weeks
gestation.
We also used regression analysis to explore the effect of mater-
nal dosage. We developed indicators of whether the dosage waslow, medium or high in two steps. First, because of differences
in dose range for each SRI medication, for each medication weconverted dosage to a zscore based on the distribution of
339Gestational exposure to SRIs
https://doi.org/10.1192/bjp.bp.107.037101  Published online by Cambridge University PressOberlander et al
dispensed doses. Second, we classified the dosage as low if the z
score was less than –0.5, medium if the zscore was between –
0.5 and 0.5 and high if the zscore was greater than 0.5. For exam-
ple, paroxetine was prescribed in doses of 10 mg, 20 mg and 30
mg, so the 10 mg dose was classified as low, the 20 mg dose as
medium and the 30 mg dose as high. We then summed the num-
ber of days of exposure for low, medium and high doses and en-tered these separately into the regression equations. We performed
Wald tests for equality of the three coefficients.
Regression analyses were undertaken using probit, Stata SE
version 9. We estimated parameters of eight models, one for eachof the outcomes reported and another eight models were used to
study risk and maternal dosage.
Results
Impact of late
v.early exposure
Late exposure (i.e. exposure after 185 days of gestation, includingthe third trimester) to SRI medication ( n=1925) was associated
with lower birth weights, shorter gestations, an increased propor-tion of neonates with a birth weight less than the 10th percentileand higher rates of respiratory distress, compared with neonateswith early exposure alone ( n=1575). The differences in birth
weight, gestational age and respiratory distress remained signifi-cant: z=4.37; z=4.90; Fisher’s exact test (two-sided) 95% CI
1.18–1.81; all P50.01 – after a Bonferroni correction for ten
comparisons. The proportion of infants born by caesarean sectionwas higher among the late group (24.6% v. 21.9%; OR=1.16,
P=0.06). A total of six infants with convulsions was reported;
although five were in the late group and one in the early group,group differences were not statistically significant.Propensity score matching
Importantly, characteristics of the mothers during pregnancy dif-
fered substantially between the late exposure and early exposure
groups (Table 1). Although the women in the two groups weresimilar in the year before pregnancy, during pregnancy womenin the late exposure group were diagnosed as depressed about
1.7 times more frequently, visited a psychiatrist about 2.5 times
more frequently and had 3.6 times more days of SRI exposurethan those in the early group, clearly suggesting that women
who took SRIs during their late pregnancy substantially differed
from the early exposure group in duration of exposure and inways that might have reflected differences in depression severity.
Propensity score matching as described above was used to ensure
that a subgroup of infants with late exposure ( n=429) were
comparable with those in the early exposure group in terms of
maternal characteristics.
10In contrast to the increased risk of
lower birth weight, reduced gestational age and increased
incidence of respiratory distress observed using unmatched com-parison between the late and early exposure groups (Table 2),
using propensity-matched subgroups neonatal outcomes were
similar between the late and early exposure groups, with theexception of lower birth weights persisting in the late exposure
group. However, this difference did not remain statistically signif-
icant after a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons(P40.05).
Effects of duration of gestational exposure
After controlling for characteristics reflecting maternal illness
severity, increased duration of exposure (days) was significantly
associated with reduced gestational age ( z=4.59), decreased birth
weight ( z=2.61), increased risk of respiratory distress ( z=4.24),

Effect of maternal dosage
Regression analysis was used to examine the impact of maternal
SRI dosage. No adverse neonatal outcome was associated witheither high or low dosage ( P40.05 for each outcome). Inciden-
tally, high dosage was associated with an increased incidence of
caesarean birth ( P=0.02).
Discussion
Four main findings emerged from this study. First, using the
accepted definitions of early and late gestational exposure may
not be appropriate for assessing the effects of the timing of
gestational SRI exposure. Maternal mental health characteristicsdiffered substantially between the early and late exposure groups
in ways that could potentially have influenced infant outcomes
beyond SRI exposure alone (i.e. differences in maternal illnessseverity that lead to altered neonatal outcomes independent ofthe effects of the medication itself). Second, in contrast to our
expectation, after using propensity score matching to account
for characteristics of maternal mental illness severity, risk of poorneonatal outcomes did not significantly differ between the early
and late exposure groups. Importantly, without controlling
for maternal illness characteristics, late exposure was associatedwith increased risk of adverse neonatal outcomes compared withearly-gestational exposure – findings that are consistent withprevious reports.
1Although late-gestational SRI exposure was
associated with a prolonged hospital stay, a reduction in birth
weight, birth weight less than the 10th percentile, shorter
gestational age, increased risk of respiratory distress and feedingdifficulties at birth, such differences disappeared when propen-
sity score matching was used to compare the groups. Third,
with increasing length of prenatal SRI use, neonatal riskincreased regardless of the timing of that exposure. Although
the rate of caesarean section was higher in the SRI exposure
group and this could have influenced neonatal outcomesas well as length of stay, using a propensity score-matched
group to account for this confounding influence this factor
no longer accounted for differences in outcomes. Fourth,maternal dosage was not associated with increased risk ofadverse neonatal outcomes. Using population-based data
linking maternal health and medication data with neonatal
health outcome, greater length of gestational exposure ratherthan the timing of exposure was associated with a significantly
increased risk of adverse outcomes after controlling for maternal
characteristics.
Impact of maternal illness
Increased risk of neonatal behavioural disturbances following
late exposure has been widely reported using cohort studies;

however, none of these studies controlled for the impact of
maternal depression during pregnancy. Population-based studies
using birth registries have also reported a variety of similareffects,
11–13but outcomes have been inconsistent. Using linked
population health data, comparing first and third trimester
exposure, accounting for some maternal characteristics (e.g.
smoking), Malm reported an increased rate of admission tospecial care nurseries with third-trimester exposure,
11but failed
to demonstrate a difference in gestational age or birth weightbetween trimesters. Similarly, Simon, using linked health datareported an association between SRI exposure and lower
gestational age and birth weight that was not limited to
late-gestational exposure.
12Comparison between studies has
been challenged by a number of methodological limitations,
including the lack of comparable control groups, cohort selection
bias, failure to account for concurrent exposure to other psycho-tropic medication (e.g. benzodiazepines) and limited knowledgeof the exact timing of gestational exposure. Importantly, failure
to account for the impact of maternal illness has been recently
cited as a critical methodological limitation in studies examiningthe impact of early v. late SRI exposure.
1Exposure to maternal
depression itself is associated with increased irritability, decreasedmotor tone and poor feeding in the neonate.
14For logistical,
ethical and medical reasons, however, it is not possible to under-
take masked randomised controlled studies of the effects of SRI
exposure limited to specific trimesters.
Previously, controlling for the concurrent impact of maternal
depression in cohort studies has been challenging because of
ethical, medical and logistical factors. In this study propensity
score matching was specifically used to account for measuredmaternal characteristics that could have influenced neonatal
outcomes, but could not be directly controlled for using admin-
istrative population health data. Additionally, these factors hadnot been accounted for in previous population health data re-
search in this field.
11–13One of the strengths of propensity score
matching is that it identifies the part of the treated group for
which there is an appropriate comparison. It is possible that the
women taking SRIs in our sample who used these medications
for more than 90 days were likely to have been treated for con-siderably longer times, and this too could have influenced neo-natal outcomes. We controlled for this possibility by matching
for length of exposure in our propensity-matched groups. The
advantages of the use of propensity score matching include avoid-ance of functional form assumptions that underlie regression
methods and the ability to identify the part of the untreated popu-
lation that can be compared with the treated population withoutextrapolation. In their analysis of selection bias, Heckman et al
concluded that the largest part of selection bias arises from‘differences in the support’ and ‘differences in densities over theregion of common support’ .
10Moreover, inaccurate functional
form and violations of the support condition – separately and
in combination – introduce bias in regression methods, as
illustrated in recent empirical work.15Propensity score matching
is a transparent method for eliminating bias due to measured
confounders because the reader can verify that matching has
produced a comparison group with similar characteristics to thetreatment group.
Our findings suggest that when accounting for factors
reflecting the character of maternal mental illness in multiplecomparisons, differences in neonatal outcomes between late and
early exposure no longer remained significant. These findings raise
the question of whether there is empiric evidence to support thesuggestion to taper the dosage of antidepressants during the lasttrimester to ensure that there is no drug exposure in the last
7–10 days of gestation.
16Further, our failure to detect neonataldifferences between early- and late-gestational exposure whenaccounting for maternal illness characteristics also questions
whether neonatal behavioural disturbances, such as respiratorydistress, reflect a genuine pharmacological withdrawalphenomenon secondary to a sudden cessation of prenatal
exposure or altered serotonin-related neurobehaviours. Instead,
these findings might reflect the effects of prolonged prenatal expo-sure which could lead to a number of mechanisms, including
neurotransmitter suppression,
17pharmacological toxicity,18
altered pulmonary vasculature,4changes in serotonergic-related
neurodevelopment19,20or effects of maternal illness itself.5The
mechanisms that underlie our findings remain to be determined;
however, there is emerging evidence from human studies suggest-ing that prenatal SRI exposure may be associated with changes in
neonatal behaviours in ways that might reflect altered serotonin-
dependent processes.
19Serotonin reuptake inhibitors block the
reuptake of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), a monoamine neuro-transmitter that has a key role in regulating neural growth and
arousal regulation. Before it takes on its role as a neurotransmitter
in the mature brain,
215-HT also acts as a trophic signal in the
developing brain by directing neural ontogeny of the serotonergic
and other systems.22As a developmental signal, 5-HT regulates
prenatal neural growth and physiological processes,23including
foetal lung development. Using animal models, SRI exposurereduced central 5-HT levels and changes in serotonin transporter
densities.
24In human studies direct evidence of such alterations
remain to be determined; however, changes in neonatal pul-monary blood flow,
4behavioural state regulation and pain
reactivity19,20have also been observed, possibly reflecting altered
5-HT-mediated processes.
Methodological limitations
The use of administrative health data to study the effects of
prenatal SRI exposure poses a number of challenges. The
concurrent use of tobacco and alcohol during pregnancy, ma-
ternal weight gain and parity could not be directly studiedusing such data. Although our sample was restricted to women
with a diagnosis of depression treated with an SRI medication,
dispensed during pregnancy, comorbid maternal conditions,which went unreported, could also not be accounted for inour study. The level, severity or course of prenatal depression
as assessed by the woman’s clinician could not be directly de-
termined, nor could the accuracy or way in which the physi-cian made the mental health diagnosis be ascertained.
Although we believed that because the medication was paid
for and dispensed it was actually taken, this consumptioncould not be verified. Because SRI use occurred in the context
of maternal depression, we were not able to study the effects
of SRI exposure independent of exposure to depression aloneor fluctuations in maternal mood that would not have beentabulated in administrative health data.
This study was undertaken to determine the effects of tim-
ing and duration of gestational medication exposure takinginto account maternal illness severity and was not directed
at assessing the safety of prenatal SRI use. Although the ben-
efits of SRI treatment during pregnancy remain to be deter-mined, it is important to emphasise that none of these
findings should diminish the urgency of recognising and treat-
ing maternal depression during pregnancy in a timely fashionwhich may require pharmacological and non-pharmacological
strategies. The decision to start or stop SRI treatment during
pregnancy should be made by an informed patient with herphysician on an individual basis.
25Given that the neonatal
342
https://doi.org/10.1192/bjp.bp.107.037101  Published online by Cambridge University PressGestational exposure to SRIs
risks associated with both early and late gestational exposure
do not appear to be substantially different, the need to taper
or stop the use of an antidepressant during late gestation mustbe weighed against the risks of undertreated maternal illnessand potential relapse.
