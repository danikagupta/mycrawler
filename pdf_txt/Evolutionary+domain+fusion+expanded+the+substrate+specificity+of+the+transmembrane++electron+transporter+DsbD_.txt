1. ABSTRACT
Gene fusion has been described as an important
evolutionary phenomenon. This report focuses on
identifying, analyzing, and tabulating human fusion
proteins of prokaryotic origin. These fusion proteins are
found to mimic operons, simulate protein-protein interfaces
in prokaryotes, exhibiting multiple functions and
alternative splicing in humans. The accredited biological
functions for each of these proteins is made available as a
database at http://sege.ntu.edu.sg/wester/fusion/
2. INTRODUCTION
Gene fusion is a phenomenon that has generated
much curiosity since its description. Fusion genes gain
added advantage in higher organisms by coupling
biochemical/signal transduction reactions through tight
regulation of fusion partners, compared to individual fusion
partners in lower organisms (1). Thus, fusion genes
produce proteins with novel or enhanced function. Gene
fusion is believed to occur by gene transfer and gene
fusion. The transfer of genes and bringing together of genes
from two genomes into a single gene (gene fusion) has long
been identified as a potentially important evolutionary
phenomenon (2). The human genome project shows that a
small fraction of human genes (<1%) is exclusively
homologous to bacterial genes (3). Though, lateral gene
transfer (4) and differential loss of genes (5) have been
described to account for the presence of bacterial genes in
the human genome, the frequencies of these transfers
remain a subject of conjecture (6). Functional and physical
associations between fusion partners and fusion products
have been discussed earlier (2, 7). Two opposing forceswork in palindrome: one that shuffles the genome and the
other that prevents the shuffle by gene fusion. Thus, fusion
genes are treated as one unit, working in synergy to achieve
optimal functionality.
Gene fusion has been identified across various
phylogenetic groups and this suggests that there exist
processes other than vertical inheritance during evolution
(8). Yanai and colleagues used gene fusion to establish
links between fusion genes and functional network of their
involvement (9). Gene fusion has also been used to
illustrate protein-protein interactions (7), novel gene
function (2), enhanced substrate specificity (10) and multi-
functional enzyme specificity (11). An interesting relational
algebra approach has also been demonstrated to identify
fusion proteins across different phylogenetic distances (12).
Therefore, identification and characterization of fusion
genes in the human genome will shed light into its
evolutionary biology. Herein, we report human fusion
genes of which many are found to mimic prokaryotic
operons and simulate protein-protein interfaces. Few others
are also known to exhibit multiple functions and alternative
splicing.

(13). This process produced 26,673 unique humansequences (UHS). A low measure of 40% sequence identity
is used to remove redundant sequences because[Frontiers in Bioscience 9, 2964-29 71, September 1, 2004]
2967homologous proteins share a common fold, even when the
overall sequence identity is less than 10% (14).
3.1.2. Dataset 2 (DS2)
The protein sequences for 71 completely
sequenced prokaryotic genomes obtained from NCBI
(ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria) form DS2. The
list is available online. Sequences from 71 genomes are
then merged into one single file (223,676 sequences). The
redundant sequences in DS2 are removed as described in
DS1. This process produced 102,135 unique prokaryotic
sequences (UPS).
3.2. Identification of fusion proteins
The 26,673 UHS are searched against the
102,135 UPS using BLASTP at an E value cutoff of ≤ 10-
10. This experiment identified 141 human fusion proteins
consisting of two or more fusion partners of prokaryotic
origin. The list is available online.
3.3. Functional inferences to fusion proteins
Molecular functions are inferred for many of
these fusion proteins using data collected from
literature. For 29 of 141 fusion proteins, ‘‘accreted
functions’’ are inferred using experimental data for
fusion partners in prokaryotic systems (Table 1). These
fusion proteins are grouped into four categories using
functional inferences.

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Although a number of fusion proteins are
reported in literature across several phylogenetic distances,
a comprehensive list for human fusion proteins of
prokaryotic origin is not available. We identified 141
fusion proteins of prokaryotic origin in the human genome.
These fusion genes may have arisen by the fusion of two or
more component genes of prokaryotic origin through gene
transfer to attain optimal functional versatility and/or
novelty. Our interest is to infer accreted functions by fusion
proteins in relation to their fusion partners in a prokaryotic
system. Hence, we classified fusion proteins into four
categories based on their accreted functions. These
categories of fusion proteins are discussed below.
4.1. Fusion proteins mimicking operons in prokaryotes
Interestingly, 18 of the 29 fusion proteins mimic
operons (cluster of genes that are juxtaposed next to each
other and are transcribed as one unit) in prokaryotes. In
prokaryotes, genes involved in a related pathway are
arranged as operons. This is also true in the un-segmented
worm C. elegans  that is shown to have operons (15).
Fusion could be a way of co-regulation as efficiently as
operons with two or more juxtaposed genes in a single unit.
This could be a potent indicator of optimal design. The
fusion protein pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS)
catalyzes ATP and NAD(P)H dependent conversion of L-
glutamate to glutamic γ-semialdehyde (GSA) in proline
biosynthesis. The P5CS protein is bi-functional with γ-
glutamate-5-kinase ( γ-GK) and γ-glutamyl phosphatereductase ( γ-GPR) activities required for proline
biosynthesis (16). N terminal γ-GK and C terminal γ-GPR
match prokaryotic GK and GPR proteins, respectively. In
T. thermophilus , these two proteins operate as one operon
with GK preceding GPR (17). This suggests that fusion
proteins in human are formed by the fusion of two or more
fusion partners. Seventeen more cases are listed in Table 1.
4.2. Fusion proteins exhibiting multiple functions
In eukaryotes, many multi-functional proteins
catalyze successive reactions in biochemical/signal
transduction pathways. The reaction rate is maximally
optimized in these cases because the subsequent reaction
centers (active sites) are physically placed side by side.
This facilitates the easy capture of reaction intermediates
from one reaction center to another as substrates
(circumventing diffusion effects). Clustering of active sites
for catalyzing a reaction sequence has several potential
advantages: the catalytic activity can be enhanced because
the local substrate concentrations are increased
significantly (18). By sequestering reactive intermediates,
their conversion by undesired chemical reactions is
prevented as substrates are channeled from one catalytic
site to the next (19). A covalently linked multifunctional
protein is likely to be more stable than non-covalently
formed protein-protein interfaces containing reaction (or
active) centers. Thus, fusion of two or more mono-
functional prokaryotic proteins into a single polypeptide in
a higher organism is certainly under selective advantage in
the course of evolution. The fusion protein GARS-AIRS-
GART exhibits multiple functions in human (20). Each of
GARS, AIRS and GART proteins are mono-functional and
part of the pur operon in B. subtilis  and E. coli (21). The
GARS-AIRS is a bifunctional protein in S. cerevisiae  and
GARS-AIRS-GART is tri-functional in Drosophila (21). In
human, it is found that GARS-AIRS-GART is tri-
functional and is formed by the fusion of three mono-
functional enzymes. Thus, fusion proteins in a higher
organism exhibit expanded function by physical co-
existence of two or more mono-functional fusion partners.
Six more cases are listed in Table 1.
4.3. Fusion proteins showing alternative splicing
Recent genome-wide analyses indicate that 40-
60% of human genes are alternatively spliced, suggesting
that alternative splicing is one of the significant processes
of human biology (22, 23, 24). Two fusion proteins are
shown to exhibit alternative splicing from this study (Table
1). A classic example is the GARS-AIRS-GART gene that
produces two spliced variants, namely: (1) a tri-functional
GARS-AIRS-GART; (2) a mono-functional GARS. The
mono-functional GARS protein is produced by differential
use of an intronic poly-adenylation signal located in the
intron separating the last GARS exon from the first AIRS
exon. Separate GARS and GARS-AIRS-GART mRNAs
have been observed in human, mouse, chicken and D.
melanogaster (25). One more case is listed in Table 1.
4.4. Fusion proteins simulating protein-protein
interfaces in prokaryotes
Some fusion proteins simulate protein-protein
interfaces in prokaryotes. For example, the human fusion
protein acetyl co-enzyme A carboxylase β simulates the[Frontiers in Bioscience 9, 2964-29 71, September 1, 2004]
2968dimer of propionyl co-A carboxylase α subunit and
propionyl co-A carboxylase β subunit in Mycobacterium
smegmatis  (26). Thus, two domains in acetyl co-enzyme A
carboxylase β simulate a protein - protein interface formed
by propionyl co-A carboxylase α subunit and propionyl co-
A carboxylase β subunit in Mycobacterium smegmatis .
This suggests that fusion events select protein - protein
interfaces by fusing two fusion partners into a single
polypeptide chain. Marcotte and colleagues identified
human fusion proteins succinyl Co-A transferase and δ-1-
pyroline-5-carboxylate synthetase made up of fusion
components that are known or predicted to interact in E.
coli (7). Interestingly, our approach identified these two
fusion proteins. It should also be noted that these two
proteins not only simulate protein-protein interfaces in E.
coli but also mimic operon like structures in T.
thermophilus and M. barkeri, respectively. Two more cases
are listed in Table 1.
5. CONCLUSION
Modular organization of proteins has been
postulated as a widely used strategy for protein evolution.
We identified 29 fusion proteins of prokaryotic origin in
the human genome. Analysis of fusion proteins suggests
that these proteins exhibit enhanced or novel functions in
human compared to their fusion partners (which are
physically separated) in prokaryotes. These fusion proteins
are found to mimic operons and simulate protein-protein
interfaces in prokaryotes. They are also found to exhibit
multiple functions and alternative splicing in humans. Our
findings strongly suggest that, by the acquisition of
additional active domains, fusion proteins expand their
substrate specificity and evolve functional novelty. It is
often thought that the function of fused genes is simply an
addition of function in pre-existing component genes.
However, this hypothesis is inconsistent with an observed
phenomenon of accelerated evolution in chimerical genes.
A recent structural analysis of the Histidine biosynthesis
components HisA and HisF indicate that the protein
structure after gene fusion was also subject to structural and
functional adaptation (27). In this sense, gene fusion may
be one of the critical steps towards creating a new gene
with novel or accreted function.
The hypothesis underlying this analysis is that a
fusion gene in human can indicate an association between
the independent genes in prokaryotes, assuming that
orthologous genes have parallel functions in both human
and one or more prokaryotes. Linking genes by way of
fusion events, as proposed earlier can hint at direct physical
interactions between proteins (7) or a more general
functional association such as between sequential members
in a metabolic pathway (18, 19). One of many possible
mechanisms of fusion events is lateral gene transfer and
this hypothesis remains as speculation due to lack of
sufficient genome data of distant evolutionary origin (6).
The idea of gene transfer from a prokaryote to human is
intriguing. However, the significant mechanical barriers, as
well as constraints to natural selection, warn caveats when
considering inter-kingdom gene transfer.
The list of fusion proteins presented in this reportwill provide some meaningful insights into protein
evolution. It should be noted that our analysis is restricted
to human fusion genes of prokaryotic origin. About 20%
proteins (29 fusion proteins) generated by our analysis are
identified to mimic operons, exhibit multiple functions,
show alternative splicing and simulate protein-protein
interfaces using data obtained rigorously from published
literature. However, the experimental verification of
accreted function using published report in this study is
minimal. Therefore, it is important to verify their accreted
functions using experimental data coupled with other
stringent and more complete computational procedures.
Characterization of this set of genes is undoubtedly critical
and this involves case-by-case isolation of their proteins
followed by specific functional assays. The data obtained
by this analysis is available for download and search at our
web site. We propose to extend our quest to identify and
characterize fusion proteins across different phylogenetic
distances. This exercise may shed some light into the
possible mechanism of fusion events between prokaryotes
and human.
