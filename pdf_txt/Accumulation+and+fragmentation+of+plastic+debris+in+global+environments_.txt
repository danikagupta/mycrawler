One of the most ubiquitous and long-lasting recent changes to the surface of our planet is the
accumulation and fragmentation of plastics. Within just a few decades since mass production of
plastic products commenced in the 1950s, plastic debris has accumulated in terrestrial environ-ments, in the open ocean, on shorelines of even the most remote islands and in the deep sea.Annual clean-up operations, costing millions of pounds sterling, are now organized in manycountries and on every continent. Here we document global plastics production and the accumu-lation of plastic waste. While plastics typically constitute approximately 10 per cent of discardedwaste, they represent a much greater proportion of the debris accumulating on shorelines.
Mega- and macro-plastics have accumulated in the highest densities in the Northern Hemisphere,
adjacent to urban centres, in enclosed seas and at water convergences (fronts). We report lowerdensities on remote island shores, on the continental shelf seabed and the lowest densities (but stilla documented presence) in the deep sea and Southern Ocean. The longevity of plastic is estimatedto be hundreds to thousands of years, but is likely to be far longer in deep sea and non-surfacepolar environments. Plastic debris poses considerable threat by choking and starving wildlife,
distributing non-native and potentially harmful organisms, absorbing toxic chemicals and degrading
to micro-plastics that may subsequently be ingested. Well-established annual surveys on coasts andat sea have shown that trends in mega- and macro-plastic accumulation rates are no longeruniformly increasing: rather stable, increasing and decreasing trends have all been reported. Theaverage size of plastic particles in the environment seems to be decreasing, and the abundanceand global distribution of micro-plastic fragments have increased over the last few decades.
However, the environmental consequences of such microscopic debris are still poorly understood.

1. INTRODUCTION
In the last half-century, there have been many drastic
changes on the surface of the planet, but one of themost instantly observable is the ubiquity and abundanceof plastic debris. Like many anthropogenic impacts onnatural systems, it is one that, despite widespread recog-nition of the problem, is still growing and even if stopped
immediately will persist for centuries. From what started
as a perceived aesthetic problem of plastics litteringtowns, countryside, shores and even far out into theocean soon emerged as causing the choking and entan-glement of wildlife. The number of potentially harmfulimplications of plastic debris that have been identiﬁedhas escalated and it is now realized that these items
may also transport persistent organic pollutants (POPs;Mato et al . 2001 ), non-indigenous species to new
locations ( Barnes 2002 ) and distribute algae associated
with red tides ( Maso´et al.2 0 0 3 ). Reports of accumu-
lation of plastics spread rapidly in terms of the taxainﬂuenced, geography and bathymetry of affected sitesand countries beginning monitoring and beach clean-upoperations. Schools and vol untary organizations have
made annual coastal collections of stranded plastics; an
important educational issue even on many of the planet’smost remote islands. In some areas though, notably onthe seabed, assessment of plastic accumulation hasbeen relatively neglected ( Goldberg 1994 ). Since 1990,
the dumping of rubbish at sea from ships has beenprohibited under the internat ional shipping regulation
MARPOL Annex V . A reduction of ship-derived plastic
debris should therefore be expected, even if global use ofplastics continues to increase. To gain an accurate andmeaningful assessment of plastics and their inﬂuence,large-scale and long-term monitoring is needed acrosscountries and environments (including the sea ﬂoor)

ﬂoated on the surface of the global ocean for longer than
life itself, but life greatly increased this through ﬂoatingalgae, shells, seeds, fruits and wood. Human activitiesand travel by water must have further greatly increasedﬂotsam (e.g. by timber), but by far the biggest changein the potential for transport by debris came with the
mass production of plastics. The accumulation of both
macro- and micro-plastics has consistently increasedon shores and in sediments for the last four decades(seeThompson et al.2 0 0 4 ;Barnes 2005 , respectively).
Their inexpensive, lightweight and durable propertieshave made plastic much more single use and‘throw-away’ than previous synthetic artefacts. Such
compounds do deteriorate in ultraviolet (UV) light,
but haline environments and the cooling effect of thesea mean degradation require very long exposure times(Gregory 1999 ). Because plastics become fouled by
marine organisms relatively quickly, the debris mayalso become shielded to some extent from UV light,
and the persistence of this debris was recently illustrated
by accounts that plastic swallowed by an albatross hadoriginated from a plane shot down 60 years previouslysome 9600 km away ( Weiss et al.2 0 0 6 ).
Mega-debris at sea was highlighted by tens of
thousands of each of basketball shoes, hockey gloves andbath toys released from containers washed off of ships
(Weiss et al. 2006 ). There are many sources for plastics
accumulating in the environment from direct droppingand dumping of litter on land or at sea to blowingfrom landﬁll sites, losses in transport and accidents.Typically, 40–80% of mega- and macro-marine debrisitems are plastic, much of it packaging, carrier bags,
footwear, cigarette lighters and other domestic items
(Derraik 2002 ;Barnes 2005 ). A recent study by Ivar do
Sul & Costa (2007) across Central and South America
also found marine debris dominated by land-basedplastic (though sometimes ﬁshery gear can be abundantalong continental shores as well). At more remote islands,ﬁshing-related sources of debris are often more prevalent.
Following establishment of ‘long-term’ monitoring
surveys of stranded debris in the 1990s, there are nowsufﬁcient data to explore seasonal, annual andlong-term patterns (e.g. Morishige et al. 2007 ).
Most waste plastics, including the large proportion
used in single-use applications such as packaging, are
disposed of in landﬁll sites. However, plastic persists
in landﬁll sites and if not properly buried may latersurface to become ‘debris’. Durability of plasticensures that wherever it is, it does not ‘go-away’; thatis, by placing plastics in landﬁll we may simply bestoring a problem for the future. Although accumulationof plastics on land is important, little information is
available on the amounts, rates, fate or impacts,
whereas there has been a major effort to quantifyimpacts on shorelines and at sea. In this paper, weexamine waste generation and disposal, together withthe abundance, composition and fragmentation ofplastic. We then consider temporal and spatial trendsin accumulation of plastics on strandlines, the sea sur-
face and at depth on the seabed. We assess publisheddata and present new surveys and observations ofspatial and temporal patterns to evaluate whetherpersistent marine debris, such as plastics, are stillincreasing and whether it varies geographically?
2. ANTHROPOGENIC WASTE AND PLASTIC
ACCUMULATION IN LANDFILL
Plastics are present in most waste, and before trends
in accumulation of plastic can be explained, it isimportant to ﬁrst consider waste generation anddisposal. Global production of plastics is estimated at225 mt yr
21(APME 2006 ). Waste composition data
are useful to identify the relative quantity and types
of plastic. As discussed in the contribution by Teuten
et al. (2009) , different plastics and resins have widely
varying properties with respect to contaminantsorption and desorption.
(a)Waste generation
Waste is typically categorized based on its point ofgeneration. Categories include municipal, commercial,industrial, agricultural and construction and demolition(C&D). However, there is ambiguity within these
categories. For example, in the USA, municipal solid
waste (MSW) includes that generated in residential,commercial and institutional (e.g. schools, governmentofﬁces) sectors, while in other countries, MSW mayinclude anything from residential waste only to allwaste managed in the municipal system (e.g. C&D,non-hazardous industrial). This complexity is exacer-
bated by the fact that some municipal systems
manage residual materials from the treatment of waterand wastewater. This relatively heavy waste will distortthe composition of dry wastes such as plastics.
Considering these multiple categories, it is difﬁcult to
compare waste composition between countries. Waste is
typically classiﬁed by the agency in need of the infor-
mation, and surveys are typically designed with speciﬁcgoals. For example, a waste sort conducted to supportplanning of a recycling programme would identifycommonly recycled plastics, including pigmented andtranslucent high-density polyethylene (HDPE) contain-ers and clear and pigmented polyethylene terephthalate
(PET), and classify the remaining plastics as ‘other’.
These categories are useful in this (recycling) context,but are less complete for a studyof plastics in the environ-ment. Another confounding issue is that the types ofplastics present vary between municipal, agriculturaland C&D waste. Municipal waste is dominated by
containers (e.g. drink bottles) and ﬁlms (e.g. carrier
bags, packaging sheets), agricultural waste may containlarge quantities of a single ﬁlm and C&D waste maycontain polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe and large plas-tic containers. Thus, a municipal stream that contains10 per cent (by mass) plastics is not equivalent to aC&D stream containing the same percentage.
Waste composition may also be presented on either
an ‘as-generated’ or ‘as-discarded’ basis. The formerincludes all the waste generated in a particularsector, prior to separation for recycling, compostingor other treatment. In contrast, ‘as-discarded’1986 D. K. A. Barnes et al. Plastic accumulation and fragmentation
Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B (2009)indicates the waste remaining for disposal after the
aforementioned separation. In areas with signiﬁcantrecycling programmes, the difference between wastegeneration and waste disposal could be 20–40%,and waste composition will change as recyclables areremoved. If properly managed at the end of its useful
life, plastic waste may be recycled, burned in combus-
tion facilities to generate energy or buried in landﬁll. Ineach of these alternatives, the waste should bedestroyed or contained, so that plastic is not releasedto the environment. The major release of plastics tothe environment is the result of inappropriate waste
management and improper human behaviour, e.g.
littering (abandoning waste away from collectionpoints). For example, plastic ﬁlms can be released tothe environment when not transported properly, andas a result of wind-blown litter at the point of burialin a landﬁll. Well-operated landﬁlls include a dailycover over the waste consisting of soil or a synthetic
material and fences surrounding the landﬁll to contain
wind-blown debris.
(b)Plastics production and recycling
Annual global consumption of the major plastic resins isconsiderable ( Andrady & Neal 2009 ). Films (e.g.
carrier bags, plastic sheets) are easiest to escape con-tainment as wind-blown debris and are likely themajor component of terrestrial plastic litter but plasticlitter also includes discarded ﬁshing equipment,
food and beverage packaging and many other items
that are present in the marine environment(Koutsodendris et al.2 0 0 8 ). Films are dominated by
low-density polyethylene (LDPE)/linear LDPE(LLDPE). We present information on plastics inMSW in the USA and their management ( table 1 ).
The quantities recovered (i.e. for recycling) as a fraction
of total discards shows that recycling rates are relativelylow. In the USA, plastic recycling is largely limited todrink containers although local authorities continue toexpand the types of plastics collected for recycling. Ingeneral, citizen participation rather than industrial
capacity limits the quantities of plastics recycled.
Efforts to provide incentives for recycling can increasethe fraction recycled ( Loughlin & Barlaz 2006 ).
In the USA, durable goods, products that last on
average for .3 years and include items such as furni-
ture and appliances, were the most important use fornew plastics ( ﬁgure 1 ). Non-durable goods, products
that are consumed in ,3 years such as trash bags
and eating utensils, were the next biggest use category.In Europe, data on various packaging applications aretypically combined rather than considered separatelyand hence disposable packaging represents theprincipal use of plastics (37%, PlasticsEurope 2008 ).
(c)The fraction of plastic in household waste
Plastics in the waste from various countries is esti-
mated at approximately 10 per cent (of mass). Such
estimates can only be used as an indication of plasticscomposition for several reasons. First, the data are notall from the same year. Second, where possible, dataare on an ‘as-discarded’ basis to reﬂect the compo-sition of waste after diversion for recycling. However,it is not always clear whether the data were reported
‘as-generated‘ or ‘as-discarded’. Third, the waste com-ponents included in national surveys vary within and
between countries. For example, the US data are for
wastes deﬁned as MSW . Finally, country-speciﬁcdata compiled for Europe ( Eurostat 2007 ) are self-
reported at the national level and are unlikely to havebeen generated using a consistent methodology. Inthe USA, plastics are estimated to comprise 11.8 and
16.3 per cent of MSW as-generated and as-discarded
mass, respectively. The composition of discardedplastics is given in table 1 (US EPA 2006 ). In Europe,
plastics are estimated to comprise 7 per cent of wastemass as-generated. Similarly, plastics were estimatedto represent 5.8, 7.3, 8–10 and 10 per cent of wastemass in Singapore, Australia, the UK and Finland,
respectively ( Barlaz 2006 ;Burnley 2007 ;Sokka et al.
2007 ). Finally, plastics were estimated to comprise 4
and 13 per cent of waste in regions of China that usecoal and natural gas, respectively, and the country-wideaverage for urban areas is projected to be 14 per centplastics in 2030 ( World Bank 2005 ). Despite the uncer-
tainty, estimates from around the world are reasonably
consistent in estimating plastics to comprise approxi-mately 10 per cent of municipal waste mass. In contrast,plastics comprise 50–80% of the waste stranded onbeaches, ﬂoating on the ocean surface and on theseabed ( Gregory & Ryan 1997 ;Derraik 2002 ;Barnes
2005 ;Morishige et al. 2007 ).

ACCUMULATION(a)Ocean surface and beaches
Many plastics are buoyant (46%; US EPA 2006 )a n d
remain so until they become waterlogged or amass toomuch epibiota to ﬂoat. Plastic items are commonly
found at the sea surface or washed up on the shoreline.
Mass production of plastics began in the 1950s, so lessthan a century ago we estimate that the amount ofanthropogenic debris at sea would have been three tofour orders of magnitude lower and restricted tomuch more degradable items. Some of the earliest
accounts of plastic debris in the marine environment
are of fragments and pellets ingested by seabirds inthe 1960s (e.g. Kenyon & Kridler 1969 ;Harper &
Fowler 1987 ), but now plastic mega- and macro-
debris is routinely observed from boats everywhere onthe planet. There has been a rapid and substantialincrease in anthropogenic debris on the ocean surface
and beaches over recent decades (e.g. Dixon & Dixon
1981 ;Derraik 2002 ;Barnes 2005 ), but of more
pertinence now are the current spatial trends. Surveysof anthropogenic debris and clean-up operations havegenerally focused on the larger items along strandlines,and there is a wide geographical variability in the type of
data available to examine potential trends. However in
the last three of decades, it has become apparent thatthe raw material for making plastics, tiny pellets andmicro-plastics have become more numerous (asmarine debris) and, like larger pieces, these can travelconsiderable distances. Volunteer observations and col-lections in a growing number of nations are aiding our
understanding of the scale and pattern of distribution
of larger size fractions of plastics in the marine environ-ment, but specialist examination is generally neededto investigate accumulation of micro-plastic, e.g. insediments ( Thompson et al.2 0 0 4 ). Beaches are the
most easily accessible areas for studying marine debris
(although such studies have some confounding factors),
yet despite the establishment of many study sites, irre-gularity of sampling, differing protocol and observershave led to very few datasets spanning more than adecade ( Barnes & Milner 2005 ).
The distribution of plastic debris is very patchy at sea
for a variety of reasons, including local wind and current
conditions, coastline geography and the points of entry
into the system such as urban areas and trade routes.For example, stranding of larger size fractions of plasticsis between one and two orders of magnitude less perlength of coastline on remote shores and at large spatialscales, abundance correlates very strongly (Pearson’s
correlation ¼0.971, p,0.001) with human popu-
lation (per 10 8latitude; Barnes 2005 ). Enclosed seas
and semi-enclosed seas such as the Caribbean ( Coe
et al.1 9 9 7 ), typically have high densities of plastic
debris but also considerable variability. High densitiesand variability can also be a feature of open ocean coast-lines e.g. Brazil ( Santos et al . 2005 )a n dH a w a i i
(Dameron et al.2 0 0 7 ). One of the key sources of inter-
annual variability seems to be changes in oceaniccirculation driven by El Nin ˇoe v e n t s( Matsumura &
Nasu 1997 ;Morishige et al.2 0 0 7 ). Typically about
2000 and 500 items of anthropogenic debris strandon north and south Atlantic Ocean shores (respectively)per linear kilometre per year, of which more than half
is plastic (scaled up from surveys of items .1c m i n
size along 200 m long beach sections; Barnes &
Milner 2005 ). More than six times as much plastic
strands in the Mediterranean Sea and less than sixtimes as much strands in the Southern Ocean shores
(Barnes & Milner 2005 ;table 2 ). Despite considerable
variability in observation and accumulation rates ofplastic debris, some temporal trends do emerge.Studies initiated in the 1980s and 1990s indicatedthat the rate of plastic stranding from oceanic sourcesshowed a sustained and considerable increase over
time (e.g. Ryan & Moloney 1993 ;Ribic
et al.1 9 9 7 ;
T orres & Jorquera 1999 ). Similarly, the occurrence of
macro-plastics associated with wildlife (e.g. in birdnests and stomachs, entangling seals, strangling a widevariety of vertebrates or even used by hermit crabsinstead of shells; Barnes 2005 )a l s od r a s t i c a l l y
increased. For example, between 1992 and 2005 the
frequency of plastic garbage items in kittiwake nests
increased from 39.3 to 57.2 per cent in northwestDenmark ( Hartwig et al.2 0 0 7 ). Monitoring of strand-
ings and effects on mega-fauna (such as birds) hasnow commenced on at least a few remote islandshores in every ocean, and these, with negligible local
sources of plastics, have revealed the scale at which
anthropogenic debris is accumulating. Barnes (2005)
found high levels but no consistent temporal trends inthe abundance of anthropogenic debris on northernhemisphere shores compared with much lower levels,but increased densities through the 1980s, 1990s andearly 2000s were reported in the southern hemisphere.
The highest increases were at high southern latitudes
(Barnes 2005 ). However, new data (reported here)
show that patterns of stranding on islands are no longerclearly increasing and may be stabilizing, though oftenwith a ‘noisy’ signal of annual variability ( ﬁgure 2 ,s e e
alsoRyan et al.2 0 0 9 ). A similar lack of clear temporal
trend in stranding densities of plastics is apparent in
data collected intermittently at Ascension I., in thetropical Atlantic Ocean, and in the Falkland Is.,south Atlantic Ocean (D. K. A. Barnes 2002, 2003unpublished data). Approximately 27 per cent ofmacro-debris items stranding at Ascension I. wasﬁshery-related, similar to remote T ern I. in the
Hawaiian Is. ( Morishige et al.2 0 0 7 ). This is much less
than on shores adjacent to important ﬁsheries e.g. inBrazil ( Oigman-Pszczol & Creed 2007 )o re v e ns u b -
Antarctic Bird I. ( Walker et al. 1997 ). Bird I. and
Signy I. in the Southern Ocean ( ﬁgure 2 ) have stranding
densities of plastics an order of magnitude lower
than remote localities at low latitudes, which in turn
have at least an order of magnitude fewer plastics perkilometre than urban sites. Further south in theSouthern Ocean, debris washes ashore much morerarely at Adelaide Island (west Antarctic Peninsula).The relatively consistent level of abundance for macro-and mega-debris at sea at high southern 1latitudes is
supported by recent resurveys around the Drake
Passage, Scotia Arc and northern Antarctic Peninsula(ﬁgure 3 ). Fifteen years after the ﬁrst ( Barnes & Milner
2005 ), the most recent survey of this area took place
early in 2008 and will involve the ﬁrst marine debris sur-veys of the south Bellingshausen and Amundsen seas.1988 D. K. A. Barnes et al. Plastic accumulation and fragmentation
Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B (2009)Visual surveys such as these are weaker as a source of
data than surface-towed trawls but much morecommon and thus arguably comparable with datacollected elsewhere, despite being semi-quantitative.Gregory et al.( 1 9 8 4 ) reported similarly low (on a
global scale) levels of ﬂoating anthropogenic debris in
the Ross Sea (Paciﬁc sector) of the Southern Ocean.
Observers from the University of Essex in conjunctionwith Greenpeace are currently undertaking repeatsurvey of plastics at sea in this area. As on surroundingstrandlines, the north Atlantic Ocean and PaciﬁcOcean have high densities of ﬂoating plastic debris,especially at 20–40 8N within a few hundred
kilometres of the coast and in the gyre centres, e.g.
between the tropical and subarctic waters(Matsumura & Nasu 1997 ). A recent (2005) survey
of the subtropical convergence zone in this areashowed plastic debris to be concentrating thereremotely using satellite imagery ( Pichel et al.2 0 0 7 ).
We know much less about the use by and distri-
bution of organisms that hitch hike on plastics andother anthropogenic debris than about the debrisitself. Macro- and mega-plastics have the potential tocarry a wide range of species and support the growthof many to reproductive viability. The high abundance,lengthy durability and travel of plastics to even the
most remote coasts make them a major potential
vector for the dispersal of organisms ( Gregory 2009 ).
New data from surveys of marine debris stranding inthe Seychelles in 2005 and 2006 showed that onsome beaches .60 per cent of items carried fouling
organisms, the highest reported anywhere (D. K. A.
Barnes 2002 onwards, unpublished data). This is ofsigniﬁcance because the prevailing currents that travel
from north Australia and south Indonesia duringsummer (South Equatorial) and from Somalia, India andN. Indonesia during winter (Indian Monsoon) couldpotentially transport a very wide range of species to less bio-diverse, mid-ocean islands. Recent surveys of marine debris
at Ascension I. (reported here for the ﬁrst time) found 38,
40 and 41 per cent of debris colonized by fauna in 2002,2003 and 2005, respectively. Much of this had probablyalso travelled considerable distances given the prevailingcurrents come from the cape of South Africa. The likelyresponse of many species to rapid regional warming is tomove pole-ward to stay within their normal thermal
envelope, but in previous phases of warming (interglacial
periods), there were few vectors to travel on. Now plasticdebris, ship hulls and other vectors make transport morerapid and frequent, and unprecedented warming at highlatitudes also means that establishment success of potentialinvaders is likely to be higher.
(b)Seabeds from shallows to abyss
As at the surface, both in the open ocean and on strand-lines, it is clear that the abundance and distributionof anthropogenic debris show considerable spatialvariability. The geographical distribution of plasticdebris is strongly inﬂuenced by hydrodynamics, geo-morphology and human factors. Moreover, there is
notable temporal, particularly seasonal, variation
with a tendency for accumulation and concentrationalong coastal and particular geographical areas.

Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B (2009)plastics can sink to the seabed (R. C. T . 1997 unpub-
lished data). Change in the nature, presence or
abundance of anthropogenic debris on the sea ﬂoor
is much less widely investigated than surface patterns.Studies that investigate seabed debris typically focuson continental shelves, and research into the deeperseabed, which forms about half the planet’s surface,is restricted by sampling difﬁculties and cost.
Patterns in even the shallow subtidal can differ
substantially from the adjacent strandlines. Oigman-
Pszczol & Creed (2007) found plastic to constitute a
much greater proportion of debris on the nearshoreBrazilian seabed than on the shore. While sonar doesnot enable discrimination of different types of debris,trawling (e.g. using Agassiz) is probably the most ade-
quate method to date, particularly when mesh size and
opening width can be manipulated ( Goldberg 1994 ,
1995 ;Galgani & Andral 1998 ). Such nets are onlysemi-quantitative and because of their design for
collecting epibenthos, probably underestimate the
quantities of debris present. Therefore, pole trawling,
with a constant mouth width, which works deeper insediments, is considered the best approach. To dateall off-shelf trawl data from submersibles have usedthis methodology. General strategies to investigateseabed debris are similar to methodology for benthic
ecology and place more emphasis on the abundance
and nature (e.g. bags, bottles, pieces of plastics) ofitems rather than their mass. Interpretation of trendsis made difﬁcult because the ageing of plastics atdepth is not well researched and the fall of plastics tothe seabed began long before speciﬁc scientiﬁc investi-gations started in the 1990s. Plastics have been found

Large-scale evaluations of seabed debris distributionand densities anywhere are scarce (but see Galgani
et al.2 0 0 0 ;Lee et al. 2006 ;Koutsodendris et al.
2008 ). However, there are a large number of small-
scale studies that have investigated anthropogenicdebris in coastal areas such as bays, estuaries andsounds (see table 2 and references therein).
The abundance of plastic debris is very dependent
on location, with values ranging from 0 to 7290items per hectare (Ha) (although an extreme ﬁnd of
10 110 anthropogenic items Ha
–1was found in 1998
at one position, 43º4208400N, 7º2209800E using a pole
trawl). Assessments of abundance clearly demonstratethe domination of this debris by plastics, as at morethan half the study sites plastics constituted .50 per
cent of debris ( table 2 ). Of the areas investigated to
date, Mediterranean sites tend to show the greatest
densities owing to the combination of a densely popu-lated coastline and shipping in coastal waters and alack of dispersion of plastics because of limited tidalﬂow or water circulation. In general, bottom debristends to become trapped in areas of low circulation
and high sediment accumulation in contrast to ﬂoating
debris, which accumulates in frontal areas. Debris thatreaches the seabed may already have been transportedconsiderable distance, only sinking when weigheddown by fouling. The consequence is an accumulationof plastics debris in bays rather than the open sea(Hess et al. 1999 ;Stefatos et al. 1999 ). Some accumu-
lation zones in the Atlantic Sea and the Mediterranean
Sea have very high debris densities despite being farfrom coasts. These densities relate to the consequenceof large-scale residual ocean circulation patterns.There are higher densities in particular areas such asaround rocks and wrecks or in depressions or channels
(Galgani et al. 1996 ). In the North Sea ( ﬁgure 4 ),
accumulation of plastics 320 km offshore fromDenmark ( Galgani et al. 2000 ) is a consequence of
several factors. These include the eddying circulation

long-term circulation of water from the gulf streamtransporting plastics northwards ( Breton & Salomon
1995 ) and to the convergence zone of seabed sediment
movements, owing to local decreases in turbidity and
turbulence ( Tappin et al. 1997 ).
Large rivers are responsible for substantial inputs of
debris to the sea bed ( Williams & Simmons 1997 ).
They can transport waste out to sea because of theirhigh ﬂow rate and the strength of bottom currents.
In smaller rivers, the displacement is slight, and
waste can be found in zones adjacent to or in the estu-aries and is often coincident with fronts ( Acha et al.
2003 ). Patterns of debris transport should therefore
be linked to river ﬂow strength and may follow patternssimilar to deposition of sediment load (often deposit-ing only small amounts of material immediately
along the coast).
Deep submarine extensions of coastal rivers also
inﬂuence the distribution of seabed debris. In someareas, local water movements transport plastics awayfrom the coast to accumulate in zones of high sedimen-tation. Under these conditions, the distal deltas of rivers
can fan out in deeper waters, creating areas of high
accumulation ( Galgani et al. 1996 ). Continental shelves
often have lower concentrations of debris since most ofthe anthropogenic debris in the outer shelf originatesfrom coasts to shelves that are washed offshore by cur-rents associated with river plumes. Data from the shelfareas off the River Rhone ( Galgani et al. 1995 b)a n d
California ( Moore & Allen 2000 ) show that circulation
can be strongly, locally inﬂuenced by storm waterevents. The accumulation of plastics in coastal canyonsmay also be related to strong currents occurring in theupper part of canyons, which decrease rapidly indeeper areas resulting from increased conﬁnement.
Accordingly, debris distribution seems to be more tem-
porally stable. An inevitable effect of this is the presenceof greater amounts of debris in deeper shelf waters than
in coastal waters ( Galgani et al.1 9 9 6 ,2000 ).
A wide variety of human activities contribute to
these patterns of seabed debris distribution, includ-
ing proximity to ﬁshing activities, urban development
and tourism. Also with plastic as a main component,debris from the ﬁshing industry is prevalent inﬁshing areas ( Kanehiro et al. 1995 ;Galgani et al.
2000 ). This type of material accounts for a high per-
centage of debris, for example up to 72 per cent in
eastern China Sea ( Lee et al . 2006 ) and 65 per
cent in the Celtic sea ( Galgani et al. 2000 ). Finally,
ﬁshing gear was also the dominant source of bothplastic and overall debris in California ( Moore &
Allen 2000 ).
Investigations using submersibles at depths beyond
the continental shelf usually consider the number of
items per linear kilometre because of variability in
transect width. They have revealed substantialquantities of debris ( ﬁgure 5 ). Besides the high
densities found in coastal canyons (up to 112 itemsper kilometre and 70% plastics), plastics and otheranthropogenic debris were found widely dispersed at
slope and abyssal depths ( Galgani et al . 2000 ).
Deployment of a remotely operated vehicle submarinein the Fram Strait (Arctic) ( Galgani & Lecornu 2004 )
revealed 0.2–0.9 pieces of plastic per linear kilometreat Hausgarten (2500 m). On dives between 5500 and6770 m, 15 items of debris were observed, of which13 were plastic, probably carried there by the
Norwegian current in the North Atlantic. At such
latitude and bathymetry, there is negligible human
activity, suggesting long-distance transport of debris.Even more than on the sea surface or strandlines ofremote locations, such as in the Southern Ocean,accumulation trends in the deep sea are of special
concern. Most polymers are highly persistent in the
marine environment and only degrade slowly via

Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B (2009)photo-catalysis when exposed to UV radiation
(Andrady 2003 ). Estimates for the longevity of plastics
are variable but are believed to be in the range of
hundreds or even thousands of years depending on
the physical and chemical properties of the polymer,but this is likely to be greatly increased at depthwhere oxygen concentrations are low and light isabsent. We know little about trends in accumulationof debris in the deep sea as studies are rare, but
the data we have indicate considerable variability.
For example, in some areas, such as the Bay ofT okyo, debris densities decreased from 1996 to2003 ( Kanehiro et al.1 9 9 5 ;Kuriyama et al.2 0 0 3 ). In
contrast, abundance remained stable in the Gulfof Lion, France during a similar period ( ﬁgure 6 ).
Furthermore in some areas around Greece, the abun-
dance of debris at depth has increased over the last8 years ( Stefatos et al .1 9 9 9 ;Koutsodendris et al .
2008 ). Interpretation of temporal trends is also compli-
cated by annual variations in debris transport, such asseasonal changes in ﬂow rate of rivers. Other seasonalfactors include variation in the position of waterfronts, the intensity of currents, swell, winds and
upwelling, which inﬂuence both the distribution and
densities. Nevertheless, if we extrapolate from existingdata, it would appear that in the Mediterranean Seaas a whole there are about 3 /C210
9debris items (ﬂoating
or sunk), of which 70–80% are plastic. New initiativesto minimize littering and to reduce, reuse and recycle
plastic should ultimately reduce plastic input into
the sea, although usage is still very high. However,fragmentation of macro- and mega-plastics to micro-plastic pieces will also contribute to future trends inthe abundance of visible plastics.
4. FRAGMENTATION OF PLASTICS IN
THE ENVIRONMENT
The longevity of plastics is a matter for some debate,and estimates range from hundreds to thousands ofyears. It is considered that (with the exception ofmaterials that have been incinerated) all of the conven-tional plastic that has ever been introduced into the
environment still remains to date unmineralized
either as whole items or as fragments ( Thompson
et al. 2005 ). However, since we have only been mass-
producing conventional plastics for around 60 years,it is too early to say exactly how long these materialswill persist. Despite the durability of these polymers,plastic items are fragmenting in the environment as a
consequence of prolonged exposure to UV light and
physical abrasion ( Colton et al. 1974 ;Gregory 1978 ;
Andrady 2003 ;Thompson et al . 2004 ). This is
particularly evident on shorelines where photo-degradation and abrasion through wave action makeplastic items brittle, increasing their fragmentation.
Some of the ﬁrst evidence of accumulation of plastic
fragments in the environment came indirectly fromexamination of the gut contents of sea birds in the1960s (e.g. Kenyon & Kridler 1969 ). Later, in the
early 1970s, small fragments of plastic were observedin seawater collected with plankton samples from theNorth Sea ( Buchanan 1971 ) and were subsequently
reported on much broader scales in the northwestern
Atlantic ( Colton et al. 1974 ). There have since been
numerous reports of fragments in the oceans, on theseabed and on shorelines worldwide ( ﬁgure 7 ), and
there is clear evidence that the abundance of thesefragments is increasing ( ﬁgure 8 ). The UK Marine
Conservation Society, which organizes annual volun-
tary beach cleaning on shores all around the UK,reports a 30 per cent increase in the abundance oflarge fragments (1–50 cm in size) and a 20 per centincrease in the abundance of smaller fragments(,1 cm) between 1998 and 2006 ( MCS 2007 ). On
shorelines close to Plymouth, one of us (R. C. T .)
recently recorded strandline material with .10 per
cent (10.89 +0.67, mean +s.d.) by weight of plastic
fragments and pieces (including some pre-productionplastic pellets, which are used to manufacture plasticproducts). In 2004, Thompson et al. (2004) reported0400E 0500E4300N1994

Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B (2009)on the abundance of even smaller fragments of plastic,
some just 20 mm, in diameter, which had accumulated
on shorelines around the UK. Using plankton samplesarchived by the Sir Alistair Hardy Foundation forOcean Science, it was evident that the abundance ofthis microscopic debris had increased signiﬁcantly inrecent years ( ﬁgure 8 ). Similar fragments have since
been identiﬁed from shorelines worldwide ( ﬁgure 7 ),
and in terms of numerical abundance, micro-plastic
can constitute over 80 per cent of intertidal plasticdebris at some locations ( Browne et al. 2007 ).
Fragments of plastic can be identiﬁed using Fourier
transform infrared (FT -IR) spectroscopy to matchspectra obtained from unknown debris items to those
of known polymers. Using this approach, a range of
common polymers including polypropylene, polyethy-lene and polyester have been identiﬁed as fragmentsand microscopic fragments. These materials have awide range of domestic and industrial uses from ropeand packaging to clothing, and it seems likely that
the fragments are forming from the breakdown of a
wide range of everyday plastic products ( Thompson
et al. 2004 ). In addition to this ‘natural’ deterioration,
it has been suggested that plastic items are also delib-erately being shredded on board some ships in orderthat plastic waste can be concealed in food waste dis-charged at sea ( van Franeker et al. 2004, 2005 ). Theabundance of small items of plastic is further increased
by the use of plastic particles as scrubbers and abra-
sives in commercial cleaning applications ( Gregory
1996 ) and by spillage of pre-production plastic pellets
(approx. 5 mm in diameter) and powders such as thoseused for rotomoulding (approx. 300 mm in diameter)
(e.g. Carpenter et al . 1972 ;Colton et al . 1974 ;
Gregory 1978 ). Hence, it is apparent that small
items of plastic are entering the environment directly
and that larger items of debris are fragmenting.
The accumulation of plastic fragments is of particu-
lar concern because they are difﬁcult to remove fromthe environment and because they have the potentialto be ingested by a much wider range of organisms
than larger items of debris. Marine mammals, turtles
and numerous other organisms are known to ingestlarge items of plastic including bags and bottles(Laist 1997 ;Derraik 2002 ). Smaller fragments can
be ingested by birds, ﬁsh and invertebrates(Thompson et al. 2004 ;van Franeker et al. 2005 ).
Upon ingestion, it is possible that these small frag-
ments may present a physical hazard in a similar wayto larger items of debris by clogging feeding appen-dages or the digestive system ( Laist 1997 ;Derraik
2002 ). Microscopic fragments are also be taken up
from the gut into other body tissues ( Browne et al.
2008 ). In addition to concerns about the physical

Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B (2009)hazards presented by this debris, it has also been
suggested that plastics could transfer harmful chemi-cals to living organisms (e.g. Oehlmann et al. 2009 ;
Talsness et al. 2009 ;Koch & Calafat 2009 ). A range
of chemicals are used as additives in the manufacture
of plastics. These increase the functionality of the
plastics, but some such as phthalate plasticizers andbrominated ﬂame retardants are potentially harmful andhave been associated with carcinogenic and endocrinedisrupting effects ( Teuten et al. 2009 ). In seawater,
plastics are also known to sorb and concentrate con-
taminants, which have arisen in the environment
from other sources. These contaminants include per-sistent organic ‘pollutants’ such as polychlorinatedbiphenyls (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene(DDE), nonylphenol and phenanthrene, which canbecome several orders of magnitude more concen-trated on the surface of plastic debris than in the
surrounding seawater ( Mato et al. 2001 ). It has been
widely suggested that these sorbed contaminants andthe chemicals additives that are used in manufacturecould subsequently be released if the plastics areingested ( Teuten et al. 2009 ). Small and microscopic
plastic fragments present a likely route for the transfer
of these chemicals because they have a much greater
surface area to volume ratio than larger items ofdebris from which they have originated and becauseof their size they are available to a wide range of organ-isms, including deposit feeders such as the lug worm,Arenicola marina , that feed by stripping organic
matter from particulates ( Mayer et al. 1997 ;Voparil
et al. 2004 ). Recent in vitro modelling studies predict
that even very small quantities of micro-plastic havethe potential to signiﬁcantly increase the transportof phenanthrene to A.marina (Teuten et al. 2007 )
and work in this volume has examined the uptakeof contaminants from plastics by birds ( Teuten
et al. 2009 ).
Given current levels of production and the quan-
tities of plastic that are already present in theenvironment, it seems inevitable that the abundance
of plastic fragments will continue to increase forthe foreseeable future. More work is thereforeneeded to model the environmental consequences ofthis debris and to produce environmental risk assess-ment models to predict the transport of a range of
contaminants by fragments of common polymers
(Thompson et al . 2005 ;Thompson 2006 ;Teuten
et al. 2007 ).
5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Less than 60 years ago, the mass production of plastics
started and now most items that people use, virtually
anywhere on the planet are partly or wholly made ofthis inexpensive, durable material. Plastics have trans-formed the surface of the planet, far beyond areas ofhuman population density—fragments of all sizes areubiquitous in soils to lake beds, from remoteAntarctic island shores to tropical seabeds. Plastics
turn up in bird nests, are worn by hermit crabs instead
of shells and are present in turtle stomachs. Humansgenerate considerable amounts of waste and the quan-tities are increasing as standards of living and thepopulation increase. Although quantities vary betweencountries, approximately 10 per cent of solid waste is
plastic. Up to 80 per cent or sometimes more of the
waste that accumulates on land, shorelines, the oceansurface or seabed is plastic. The most common itemsare plastic ﬁlms, such as carrier bags, which areeasily wind blown, as well as discarded ﬁshing equip-ment and food and beverage packaging. Strandlinesurveys (beach-cleaning operations) are now organized
in many countries and provide information about
temporal and spatial trends. However, these surveystypically only provide data on coarse trends and largeritems. There is considerable variation in methodologybetween regions and between investigators, and morevaluable and comparable data could be obtained by
standardizing monitoring approaches ( Ryan et al .
2009 ). Accumulation rates vary widely with many fac-
tors such as proximity of urban settlements, shore use,prevailing wind and ocean currents and region. Therewere dramatic increases in quantities of mega- andmacro-plastic debris in the northern hemisphere upto the 1990s. Quantities of debris in the oceans
appear to have stabilized over the last decade but
have increased on shorelines. However, this could indi-cate quantities of debris entering the sea are declining,but the material already in the sea is progressivelybeing deposited on the shore or sinking to the deep.Accumulation rates are much lower in the Southern
Hemisphere but are still increasing signiﬁcantly,
although repeat surveys on remote Antarctic islandsand ocean areas suggest stabilization over the lastdecade. Fouled by organisms and sediment, plasticscan sink and form an even higher proportion ofhuman waste reaching the seabed, and quantities inexcess of tens of thousands of items square kilometres
have been reported. As on beaches and the ocean sur-
face, enclosed seas such as the Mediterranean have thehighest densities, but investigations in deeper watershave shown that high accumulation rates can stretchfar (hundreds of kilometres) from the coast,

canyons. As in surface environments, trends of debrisaccumulation on the seabed increase at somelocations, but are stable or decreasing at other sites.Quantities of debris in the oceans appear to havestabilized in the oceans over the last decade but have
increased on shorelines. The problem of plastic frag-
ments has taken on increased importance in the lastfew decades. From the ﬁrst reports in the 1970s, itwas only a few years before the widespread ﬁnding ofplastic including reports of microscopic fragments(20mm in diameter). The abundance of microscopic
fragments was greater in the 1980s and 1990s than
in previous decades. It has also been suggested thatplastic waste is deliberately being shredded into frag-ments to conceal and discarded at sea. Plastics of allsizes are now reaching the most remote and deepestparts of the planet, and although we have muchbetter knowledge of their sources, quantities and
distribution, we still understand little about their
longevity and affects on organisms. Further, we havemade little progress in reducing the release of plasticto the environment (see discussion in Thompson et al.
2009 ). Temporal trends of macro-plastics on remote
islands suggest that regulations to reduce dumping at
sea have been successful to some extent. However,
our sustained demand for plastic means that contami-nation of the environment by micro-plastic piecesseems set to increase. In addition, future samplingmay reveal increasing quantities of debris in theplanet’s least known habitat, the deep sea.
