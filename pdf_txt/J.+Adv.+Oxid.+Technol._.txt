Abstract: The oxidation of organic compounds by Fe(II)/H202 (known as Fenton's reagent) has been known for nearly 
a century. Recently, this reagent has been used in wastewater treatment technology. The scope and the range of 
applicability of Fenton and Fenton like [Fe(ni)/H202] reagents in advanced oxidation technology is reviewed and selected 
examples of their application are presented. The rate of oxidation and the extent of mineralization of organic pollutants 
with these  reagents is improved significantly by irradiation with UV-visible light. The usefulness of UV-visible/ 
Fe(II)/H202 and UV-visible/Fe(III)/H202 processes are exemplified through specific applications. Still, much higher 
improvement in the rate of destruction of organic pollutants is achieved by replacement of Fe(II)/Fe(III) with ferrioxalate. 
Examples are provided indicating the superiority of the UV-visible/ferrioxalate/H202 process compared to the UV-
visible/Fe(II)/H202 and UV-visible/Fe(III)/H202 processes. Finally, the ferrioxalate/H202 reagent is shown to be suitable 
for solar detoxification of contaminated water. Again, selected examples indicate the role that this reagent can play in 
the solar detoxification process. 
Photochemical degradation processes [also called 
Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOP)] are gaining an 
increasingly important place in waste water remediation 
(1). AOP systems are based on oxidative reactions 
initiated by hydroxyl radicals (-OH), which are 
frequently generated by the photolysis of hydrogen 
peroxide. Since hydrogen peroxide does not absorb 
significantly beyond 300 nm and absorbs only weakly in 
the range 200-300 nm, the UV/H202 process is often not 
suitable for the treatment of polluted water with a high 
UV absorbance and/or a high background total organic 
carbon concentration. Thus an alternative oxidation 
process (or processes) is needed for the treatment of 
such highly contaminated waters. Photo-oxidation 
mediated by ferric ion  and/or ferric chelates seems to 
provide a suitable treatment alternative. 
Iron is the second most abundant metal and the 
fourth most abundant element found in the Earth's crust 
where it is found as ferrous [Fe(II)] or ferric [Fe(III)] 
ions. It is introduced into the atmosphere by wind and 
is found in aerosols, fogs,  rain drops, ground waters and 
lakes. It  plays a significant role in atmospheric 
photochemistry and its importance in the aquatic 
environment has long been recognized (2-7). 
In solution at an acidic pH of about 0, ferric ion 
exists as [Fe(H20)6]3+. However, it hydrolyzes and 
forms hydroxo species at higher pH.  The initial 
hydrolysis equilibria among various hydrolyzed Fe(III) 
species are (5): 
Fe3+ + OH" Fe(OH)2+ Kt = 6.5 x  10u (1) 
Fe(OH)2+ + OH" Fe(OH)2+ K2 = 3.08 x 1010 (2) 
As shown in Figure 1, the proportion of different 
species varies with the acidity of the solution. The 
18 J. Adv. Oxid. Technol, Vol. 1, No. 1, 1996 hydroxylated species are yellow in color and exhibit a 
ligand-to-metal charge-transfer (LMCT) absorption band 
in the UV region which tails into the visible region. 
Figure  2 shows the absorption spectra of various Fe(HI) 
species in solution. Irradiation of these species with 
UV and near-UV light (3) produces Fe(II) and the 
hydroxyl radical (-OH) according to: 
Fe(ni)(OH)2+ + hv — Fe(II) + -OH (3) 
-—». PPte.

reaction (3) was investigated by Larson et al. (9).

is supported by the measured quantum yield of Fe(II) 
formation from various Fe(III) species (Table 1). The

This reaction is believed to be responsible for the 
formation of hydrogen peroxide in atmospheric and 
surface waters (2,3). However, this may not be a 
significant route for production of hydrogen peroxide, 
due to solubility limitations of Fe(III) species at natural 
pH. 
Figure 2. Absorption spectra of monomelic Fe(lll) and 
Fe(lll)-hydroxo species. Atmospheric and surface waters are also rich in 
carboxylates (RCOO") and polycarboxylates, such as 
citrates, oxalates, etc. These species react with Fe(III) 
to form Fe(III)-carboxylate/polycarboxylate complexes 
and/or associated ion pairs. These complexes also 
exhibit a LMCT band in the UV-visible region. 
Excitation into this band results in transferring an 
electron from a ligand orbital to a metal orbital, thus 
generating Fe(II), C02, and organic radicals (11). It is 
assumed that solar irradiation of these complexes is 
responsible for: (a) the formation and destruction of 
hydrogen peroxide in natural aquatic environments; 
(b) the destruction and prevention of accumulation of 
organic pollutants in the environment; and (c) the 
recycling of carbon dioxide. 
Fenton's and Fenton like Reagents 
A hundred years ago, the oxidation of maleic acid 
by Fe(II)/H202 (known as the Fenton's reagent) was 
reported by Fenton (12). Subsequently, it was shown 
(13) that the hydroxyl radical is the oxidizing species in 
this system which is formed according to: 
Fe(II) + H202 —* Fe(III) + OH" + -OH (7) 
k = 76.5 M"1 s'1 
Although this reagent has been used in mechanistic 
investigations in organic chemistry, its potential in 
wastewater treatment has only begun in recent years 
(14-22). It has been demonstrated that Fenton's reagent 
is able to destroy phenols, chlorinated phenols and 
herbicides in water media, as well as reducing chemical 
oxygen demand (COD) in municipal wastewater. It is 
being employed for the treatment of wastewaters 
contaminated with phenolic pollutants. The usefulness 
of the Fe(II)/H202 process as a potential oxidant of soil 
contaminants has also been investigated (23-2S). It has 
been shown that pentachlorophenol and trifluralin are 
extensively degraded (3), while hexadecane and dieldrin 
were partially transformed (25) in a soil suspension at an 
acidic pH. 
The use of Fe(II)/H202 as an oxidant for wastewater 
treatment is attractive due to the fact that: (a) iron is a 
highly abundant and non-toxic element;  and (b) hydrogen 
peroxide is  easy to handle and is environmentally 
benign. However, it requires a stoichiometric amount of 
Fe(II), demanding a high concentration of Fe(II). 
Hydrogen peroxide decomposes catalytically by 
Fe(m) and generates hydroxyl radicals in the process 
(13). Thus ferrous ion in Fenton's reagent can be 
replaced with ferric ion (21). The mechanism proposed 
for free ferric ion involves the hydroxyl (-OH) and 
hydroperoxyl radicals (H02-) according to:

The rate constant for reaction of ferrous ion with 
hydrogen peroxide is high and Fe(II) oxidizes to Fe(III) 
in a few seconds to minutes in the presence of excess 
amounts of hydrogen peroxide. For this reason, it is 
believed that a majority of the waste destruction 
catalyzed by Fenton's reagent is simply Fe(III)-H202 
catalyzed destruction process, and Fenton's reagent 
with an excess of hydrogen peroxide is essentially a 
Fe3+/H202 process (known as a Fenton like reagent) 
(21). 
The mineralization of the herbicide 2,4-D by 
Fenton and Fenton like reagents is shown in Figure 3. 
The data show that the extent  and the overall rate of 
mineralization are independent of the oxidation state of 
iron employed (21). However, the initial rate of 
mineralization of organic pollutants is faster with 
Fe(II)/H202 than Fe(III)/H202. This is due to the surge 
of hydroxyl radicals which is produced by Fenton's 
reagent. The rate of production of hydroxyl radical is 
slow with Fenton like reagents. Thus, the use of 
Fenton's reagent is beneficial in cases where only the 
transformation of parent pollutants is desired. The Fe(II)/Fe(III)-H202  system has its maximum 
catalytic activity at a pH of about 2.8-3.0. An increase 
or decrease in the pH sharply reduces the catalytic 
activity of the metal ion. At high pH, the ferric ion 
precipitates as ferric hydroxide and at lower pH, the 
complexation of Fe(III) with H202 [reaction (S)] is 
inhibited. To overcome this problem, Sun and 
Pignatello (26) have employed Fe(III) chelates in place 
of Fe(II)/Fe(III). They have shown that a variety of 
herbicides and pesticides can be transformed and 
partially mineralized by Fe(III) chelates at neutral pH. 
The use of Fe(III) chelates for the destruction of organic 
pollutants in soil was also investigated by Pignatello and 
Baehr (27). 
Fenton and Fenton like reagents can oxidize and 
transform, but do not completely mineralize, organic 
pollutants. Rather, the pollutants are partially oxidized 
and transformed to some intermediates which are 
resistant to further oxidation (20-22). At this point, 
hydrogen peroxide is consumed through Fenton's 
reaction and the following reactions: 
Fe(III) + H202 —* Fe(II) + H02- + H+ (12) 
Fe(III) + H02- —  Fe(II)  + 02 + H+ (13) 
Fe(II) + -OH —» Fe(III) + OH" (14) 
k = 4.3 x 108 M"1 s"1 
and oxidation of Fe(II) by hydroxyl radical competes 
with the slow reaction of -OH with some organic 
intermediates such as carboxylic acids. Normally, about 
40-60% of the carbon is converted to C02, depending on 
the amount of Fe(II), peroxide and the solution 
temperature.

Figure 3. Comparison of Fe(ll)/H202 with Fe(lll)/H202 for 
mineralization of (ring-14C)-2,4D [from (21) with permission]. The rate of degradation of organic pollutants with 
Fenton/Fenton like reagents is accelerated strongly by 
irradiation with UV-visible light (19-22,28). An 
example is provided in Figure 4, where the destruction 
of ethylbenzene in tap water is compared using the 
Fenton's reagent or the photo-Fenton (/zv/Fenton) 
process, demonstrating the greater efficiency of the 
latter process. If desired, organic pollutants can be 
mineralized completely with UV-visible irradiation. For 
example, Pignatello (21) and Sun and Pignatello (22) 
have shown that a number of herbicides and pesticides 
can be totally  mineralized by the Av/Fe(III)/H202 
process, and the mineralization of chlorophenol by the 
Av/Fenton process has been demonstrated by Rupert 
et al. (20). 
The increased efficiency of Fenton/Fenton like 
reagents with UV-visible irradiation is attributed to:

reagents for the destruction of ethylbenzene. 
• Photoreduction of ferric ion: Irradiation of ferric ion 
(and/or ferric hydroxide) produces ferrous ion according 
to reaction (3). The formation of ferrous ion (20) 
during mineralization of phenol is shown in  Figure 5. 
The ferrous ion produced reacts with hydrogen peroxide 
generating a second hydroxyl radical and ferric ion, and 
the cycle continues. Lunak et al. (29-32) observed the 
enhanced rate of photo-oxidation of salicylic and benzoic 
acid by hydrogen peroxide in the presence of Fe(III), as 
well as the increased rate of photodecomposition of 
hydrogen peroxide in the presence of transition metal 
ions. However, reaction (3) alone cannot account for 
the observed rate of disappearance and oxidation of 
organic pollutants.

• Efficient use of light quanta : The absorption spectrum 
of hydrogen peroxide does not extend beyond 300 nm and has a low molar absorption coefficient beyond 
250 nm. On the other hand, the absorption spectrum of 
ferric ion (and/or hydroxo ferric ions) extends to the 
near UV-visible region and has a relatively large molar 
absorption coefficient, thus making more  efficient use of 
the lamp output when polychromatic light is employed. 
Consequently, photo-oxidation and mineralization can 
even proceed by irradiation with visible light (21,22). 
• Photolysis of Fe(III)-organic intermediate chelates-. 
The initial oxidation of organic pollutants generates 
oxygenated intermediates (i.e. intermediates with 
hydroxyl and/or carboxylic functional groups) which can 
react with Fe(III) and form complexes. These 
complexes are also photoactive and produce C02, 
organic radicals and ferrous ions on irradiation (11). 
Fe(IH)(RC02) + hv —>• Fe(II) + C02 + R- (15) 
This results in an increased rate of destruction of organic 
pollutants as the reaction progresses. An example of 
this behavior is provided in Figure 6 for the destruction 
of toluene in tap water. Additional examples are 
provided by Sun and Pignatello (21). They have shown 
that mineralization of 2,4-D can be divided into two 
stages. The first stage is dominated by oxidation with 
hydroxyl radicals, where the light contributes to the 
production of -OH, which is the primary oxidant at this 
stage of mineralization process. This was shown by 
quenching when  known hydroxyl radical scavengers, 
such as methanol or i-butanol, were added. In contrast, 
the second stage of mineralization could not be quenched 
by hydroxyl radical scavengers. Thus it appears that the 
second stage (i.e. about 60% of mineralization) occurs 
without the participation of hydroxyl radicals and is 
likely entirely the result of the photochemistry of iron 
complexes [i.e. reaction (25)].

Any organic pollutant that has a reasonable rate of

process. Thus, aromatic and chloro-aromatic hydro-
carbons, chlororinated ethylenes, ethers, alcohols,

pollutants in contaminated waters. Mineralization is a

Acetone 6 _b 108 58 The use of the sun's free radiation energy for the 
treatment of contaminated water has attracted a lot of 
attention in recent years. However, almost all the solar 
radiation energy below 300 nm  is absorbed by 
atmospheric ozone. Thus, any solar photo-oxidation 
process must rely on an absorber that is active above 
300 nm. This effectively rules out ozone and hydrogen 
peroxide. 
The best known catalyst for solar photo-oxidation is 
the anatase form of titanium dioxide, Ti02 (39). It 
absorbs about 3 % of solar spectrum (40) and has a low 
quantum yield (about 4%). Therefore, under ideal 
conditions, titanium dioxide can only utilize about 
0.12 % of the incident solar radiation energy. Transition 
metal ions and their complexes with organic molecules 
absorb in the near UV-visible region (vide infra) and are 
photoactive and thus should provide a suitable mediator 
for the capture and use  of solar energy.

Download Date | 4/22/17 2:29 PMThe solar irradiation of hydroxo ferric ions and 
ferric-carboxylates/polycarboxylates is believed to play 
a crucial rule in the destruction of  organic pollutants in 
clouds, lakes and oceans, and is responsible for the 
formation and destruction of hydrogen peroxide in 
natural waters. The concentration of dissolved iron 
species varies from 10"7 M to 10"4 M. This amount of 
iron could potentially destroy 0.027 g/L/day to 
2.7 g/L/day of oxalic acid and/or similar amounts of 
other polycarboxylates in  atmospheric water droplets 
(2c). 
The use of sunlight for the destruction of organic 
pollutants was first demonstrated by Langford et al. (6). 
They have shown that solar irradiation of Fe(III)-
nitrilotriacetate results in the destruction of 
nitrilotriacetic acid. From this work, they suggested that 
solar irradiation of Fe(III)-organic complexes could be 
responsible for the destruction of detergents (natural and 
synthetic) and hence prevents their accumulation in the 
environment. Miles et al. (7) in the early 1980's 
demonstrated that sunlight irradiation of Fe(III)-humic 
complexes consumes oxygen and the rate of oxygen 
consumption increases with increasing concentrations of 
Fe(III) and/or humic substances. This was attributed to 
the photoreduction of Fe(III) [i.e. reaction (5)] and the 
consumption of oxygen by the photolytic products 
[i.e. reactions {4-6)]. The consumption of oxygen was 
reduced by 50% with the esterification of humic 
substances. Thus, it was concluded that the sunlight 
driven  photolysis of Fe(III)-humic complexes is 
responsible for the undersaturation of oxygen in colored 
lake surface waters. These observations indicate 
that Fe(III)-carboxylates/polycarboxylates are suitable 
candidates for capturing solar energy. 
Ferrioxalate has been shown to be a highly suitable 
candidate for capturing solar energy. As indicated 
earlier, it absorbs strongly between 250-500 nm, has a 
quantum efficiency of > 1 and can absorb and utilize

Thus, the ferrioxalate/H202 system could theoretically be 
about 120 times more efficient than the Ti02 
photocatalyst in utilizing solar energy. Figure 9 
compares the destruction of trichlorethylene (TCE) in tap 
water with ferrioxalate/H202 and Ti02/H202 by solar 
irradiation, demonstrating the superiority of the former 
mediator compared to the latter one. As can be seen, 
sunlight photolysis of ferrioxalate/H202 is much more 
effective than titanium oxide/H202 in destroying TCE. 
The rate of destruction of TCE mediated by 
ferrioxalate/H202 is about fifty times faster than that 
catalyzed by titanium oxide. A second example of the 
use of sunlight for the clean-up of water (41) is provided 
in Figure 10. In this figure, the destruction of toluene 
in a contaminated ground water by sunlight photolysis 
of ferrioxalate/H202 and Fe(III)/H202 is compared, 
indicating the far greater efficiency of the former 
process as compared to the latter one.

Conclusions 
Although the UV/H202 oxidation process has the 
capacity of being able to virtually destroy most organic 
pollutants in water media and is being increasingly 
employed for the remediation of  contaminated water, 
there are situations [high concentration and high 
chemical oxygen demand (COD)] where the UV/H202 
process is too costly. The scope and range of 
applicability of photo-oxidation technology can be 
improved significantly by the use of ferric ion, 
hydroxylated ferric ion and Fe(III)-carboxylate/ 
polycarboxylate complexes. These species exhibit 
LMCT bands in the UV-visible region and produce 
ferrous ion with excitation into this band. Thus, the

The oxygenated products react with Fe(III) and the

It is for these reasons that irradiation of 
Fenton/Fenton-like reagents with UV-visible light 
improves the rate of destruction and the extent of 
mineralization of organic pollutants. However, these 
reagents are only suitable for the remediation of 
polluted water with low to medium absorptivity in the 
UV, near-UV and visible region, and with low to 
moderate background chemical oxygen demand. 
Av/Fe(HI)-Oxalate/Hydrogen Peroxide 
The photoreactivity of Fe(III)-carboxylate/ 
polycarboxylates has long been recognized and 
photodecarboxylation of carboxylates (11) and 
deamination (33) of a-aminoacid complexes of Fe(III) 
has been known for some time. Ferrioxalate is the 
oldest and best known photoactive example of Fe(III)-
polycarboxylate complexes. Its photoreactivity was first 
discovered in 1833 (34) and was later suggested as a 
chemical actinometer for light intensity measurements. 
Today, it is the actinometer of choice (11,35). 
Irradiation of ferrioxalate in acidic solution generates 
Fe(II) and carbon dioxide, according to: 
tFe(C204)3]3- + hv—* [Fe(C204)2]2" + QO4"- (17)

The photochemistry of ferrioxalate has been studied 
extensively and the quantum yield of Fe(II) formation 
W>Fe(ii)) 38 a function of irradiation wavelength both  in 
the absence and presence oxygen have been reported by 
numerous researchers. <f>Fe(II) is about 1.0-1.2 and 
independent of irradiation wavelength in the range of 
250-480 nm and decreases with further increase of 
irradiation wavelength. 
Although photochemistry of Fe(III)-carboxylate/ 
polycarboxylates has been known for some time, its 
importance in the destruction of organic pollutants has 
only recently begun to emerge. The photolysis of 
ferrioxalate produces ferrous (free or complexed with 
oxalate) ion, which, in combination with hydrogen 
peroxide provides a continuous source of Fenton's reagent. The latter is, of course, a precursor to the 
hydroxyl radical. Lunak et al. (32) have shown that the 
rate of photolytic destruction of hydrogen peroxide is 
greatly accelerated in the presence of ferrioxalate and 
that hydrogen peroxide can be destroyed with irradiation 
in a region where only ferrioxalate absorbs radiation. 
This is not surprising in view of the photoreactivity of 
ferrioxalate [reactions (13-15)]. The formation of 
hydroxyl radicals in the photolysis of ferrioxalate/H202 
mixtures was demonstrated recently by Zepp et al. (36). 
They showed that reaction with H202 is the preferred 
pathway for the oxidation of photogenerated Fe(II) and 
that the rate of formation of hydroxyl radicals is equal to 
the rate of formation of ferrous ions. 
Until recently, the combination of ferrioxalate/H202 
was not employed for the treatment of pollutants in 
contaminated water. Lunak et al. (29) observed that the 
rate of hydroxylation of salicylic acid with hv/H202 
increases in the presence of Fe(III) or ferrioxalate. The 
increase in the rate of hydroxylation was partly 
attributed to reduction of ferric ion by photolysis 
[i.e. eq (5)] and partly to energy  transfer from excited 
organic molecules to hydrogen peroxide and ferric ion. 
The latter is then reduced to ferrous ion. Their data, 
however, does not indicate that any advantages could be 
gained in employing ferrioxalate over ferric chloride, 
perhaps in part due to the use of monochromatic 
radiation in the near-UV region and to Fe(III)-salyclic 
acid/benzoic acid complex formation. 
Safarzadeh-Amiri et al. (37,38) have shown that 
hv/ferrioxalate/H202 is a highly efficient and powerful 
oxidant for the destruction of organic pollutants in 
contaminated ground and waste waters. Figure 7 
compares the destruction of 2-butanone 
(methylethylketone, MEK) in a ground leachate water 
with UV/H202, UV-visible/Fenton and UV-visible/ 
ferrioxalate/H202, while Tables 2 and 3 provide a list of 
different pollutants in this and other contaminated waters 
that were treated by this new photo-oxidation process. 
Table 2 also provides data for the treatment of the same 
pollutants by other UV-visible/oxidation processes. 
The data clearly indicate that the UV-visible/ 
ferrioxalate/H202 process is much more efficient (by a 
factor of 2-6, depending on the pollutant being treated) 
than other photo-oxidation processes. 
The high efficiency of this process, as compared 
to other UV-driven processes, is attributed to: 
(a) ferrioxalate absorbs strongly in the UV-visible 
region, from 250-480 nm, resulting in more efficient use 
of the lamp output; and (b) the quantum yield of Fe2+ 
formation is high (about 1-1.2) and independent of 
irradiation wavelength in the range of 250-480 nm. 
Thus, the yield of hydroxyl radical formation is expected 
to be high (on the order of unity) in this process. 
Indeed, Zepp et al. (36) have shown that the quantum 
yield of hydroxyl radical formation is on the order of

peroxide provides a continuous source of hydroxyl 
radicals. The data and examples provided in this article 
clearly indicate the prominent role that ferric ion can 
play in AOP technology. 
The photo-oxidation of organic pollutants in water 
mediated by iron and iron chelates, is initiated by the 
hydroxyl radical, which with dissolved oxygen 
eventually converts organic pollutants to C02, H20 and 
mineral acids. However, the detailed mechanism of the 
complex reaction pathways have not been elucidated. 
Therefore, there is a need for further studies to 
understand these mechanisms and to expand the scope of 
/zv-metal ion/H202 mediated remediation processes to 
include other transition metal ion(s).
