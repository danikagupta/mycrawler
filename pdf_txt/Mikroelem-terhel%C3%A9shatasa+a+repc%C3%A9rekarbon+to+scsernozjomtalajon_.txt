ABSTRACT 
Pleurotus 
eryngii, dyes, 
decolorization, 
immobilization   The potential of Pleurotus eryngii  was studied for 
decolorization ability of different types of textile dyes  which 
were screened on liquid medium . During decolorization study on 
seven textile dyes, it was found that  P. eryngii  had the most 
efficient decolorization on reactive Blue 21 with decolorization 
percentage (98.4%) . On the other hand,  the immobilized P. 
eryngii on wheat straw, rice straw, sugar cane waste and wheat 
bran had biodegradation ability of Blue 21 dye. The 
immobilization of fungus on sugar cane waste gave more 
efficient decolorization of Blue 21 with decolorization 
percentage (83.5%). Also it was found that the  decolorization 
percentage in case of free P. eryngii  was (50.8%) . The fungus 
has the ability to produce lignin-degrading enzymes as laccase, 
Mn peroxidase, peroxidase and catechol oxidase enzymes . 
Immobilized P. eryngii  on sugar cane waste exhibited the ability 
to treat industrial textile effluent, 85 to 90% reductions of various 
nutrients including biological oxygen demand (BOD) and 
chemical oxygen demand COD were achieved and color removal 
reached to 96% . So, it was suggested that the immobilized P. 
eryngii might be applicable to textile effluent system. It was 
found that the reuse of the treated textile effluent with 
immobilized P. eryngii  on sugar cane waste for irrigation of Basil 
plant and good result similar to that obtained by tap water.

1. Introduction  
Major classes of synthetic dyes, 
including azo, anthraquinone and 
triarylmethane dyes, are toxic or even 
carcinogenic compounds with long turn 
over times (Hartman et al. 1978). Azo 
dyes are the most important group of 
synthetic colorants. Synthetic azo dyes are 
the largest class of dyes, and represent 
more than half of the dyes as 1 million 
tons (Stolz 2001). Dye-containing 
effluents represent enormos problem 
because of their high chemical oxygen 
demand (COD) and biological oxygen 
demand (BOD), suspended solids and the 
content of toxic compounds which 
consider agreat problems in ecosystem 
with releasing in the environment, they 
often exhibit toxic effects on different 
organisms. Threating ecosystems by 
reducing sunlight penetration, this reduces 
photosynthetic activity and dissolved 
oxygen concentration (Banat et al., 
1996). Textile wastewaters are rated as 
the most pollutant among all industrial 
sectors. Important pollutants in textile 
effluents are mainly recalcitrant organics, 
colors, toxicants and inhibitory 
compounds, surfactants, chlorinated 
compounds and salts ( Sen and Demirer, 
2003). Sudarjanto et al., (2006)  stated 
that some of the dyes and/or products are 
carcinogenic and mutagenic. Therefore, 
textile wastewater containing dyes must 
be treated before discharging into the 
environment (Tantak and Chaudhari, 
2006). 
There are many methods for the 
treatment of dye-containing effluents like 
physical and chemical methods, including 
adsorption, coagulation, precipitation, 
filtration and oxidation. Adsorption is the 
method most widely used at present due to its convenience and efficiency (Nigam 
et al. 1996). 
Some microorganisms, including 
bacteria, fungi and algae can degrade or 
absorb a wide range of dyes (Robinson et 
al. 2001). Biological approach using fungi 
to treat dye-containing effluents has 
received much attention recently. The 
white rot fungi have proven its capability 
to degrade synthetic chemicals, such as 
azo dyes from textile industry (Zhao and 
Hardin, 2007 ). Most of the previous 
studies reported focused on the lignin-
degrading enzymes of P. chrysosporum  
and Tramotus versicolor . Lately, there has 
been a growing interest in studying the 
lignin-modifying enzymes of a wide array 
of white rot fungi searching for better 
lignin-degrading systems (Revankar and 
Lele 2007).  Many studies have 
demonstrated that white rot fungi can 
degrade a wide variety of structurally 
diverse dyes such as azo, anthraquinone, 
heterocyclic, triphenylmethane and 
polymeric dyes due to the lignin 
degrading system enzymes: lignin-
peroxidase (LiP), manganese-peroxidase 
(MnP) and laccase ( Cripps et al. 1990; 
Vicuna et al. 1993; Heinfling et al. 1998) 
The ligninolytic system of Pleurotus  sp. 
has been extensively studied, and it 
appears to be an effective alternative for 
the bioremediation of resistant pollutants 
(Cohen et al. 2002). Also immobilization 
of ligninolytic fungi on solid supports was 
used for cultivation and enzyme 
production ( Kasinath et al., 2003, 
Saparrat and Guillén, 2005 and Šnajdr 
and Baldrian, 2007 ), dye decolorization, 
and pollutant degradation ( Shin et al., 
2002, Novotný et al., 2004, Šašek et al.,  90 Eman H.F. Abd El-Zaher   et al (2019)  
2006,  Svobodová, et al., 2006 and 
Przysta et al, 2018). 
The aim of this work is testing the 
decolorization by biodegradation process 
of seven azo dyes and the textile dyeing 
wastewater by immobilized Pleurotus 
eryngii on sugar cane waste. Additional 
phytotoxicity assays were investigated by 
irrigation of basil plant with treated waste 
water to know its safety in irrigation of 
the plant.  
Materials and methods 
Dyes and chemicals 
Seven dyes were used in this study 
which were reactive blue 21, reactive 
yellow 160, orange 122, direct congo red, 
direct yellow 5g, acid methyl orange and 
Acid Eriochrome black T. These dyes  
were purchased as a powder from Egypt 
Company for the textile industry in El-
Mahalla El-Kubra, Gharabia, 
Governomate, Egypt.  
Organism  
Pleurotus eryngii  somycel France 
was obtained from mushroom laboratory 
culture collection (MLCC), El-Giza, 
Egypt. It was maintained in Petri dishes 
containing Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) 
medium at 30°C.  
Decolorization of dyes 
Two fungal discs of 0.5 cm 
diameter on solid medium were removed 
with a sterile cork borer and inoculated in 
250 ml conical flasks containing 100 ml 
sterilized PDA liquid medium. The 
inoculated media containing 50 mg/l for 
each tested dye were incubated at 30°C 
and 150 rpm, un-inoculated sterile growth 
medium served as control. The difference 
in color intensity of inoculated flasks was observed until 10 days for decolorization 
of dye (Yang et al., 2009). 
Decolorization assays 
Decolorization of dyes was detected 
using the culture supernatant after 
centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 30 min. 
Control was performed using the same 
medium but without the tested fungus. 
Assays were performed by using visible 
recording spectrophotometer (labomed, 
Inc) at as pecific λ length for each dye. 
Color removal was reported as: 
Decolorization (%) = ( A o _ At )/Ao 
x 100 
Where A o is the absorbance of 
initial dye solution, which is constant for 
each dye and equals 0% decolorization, 
and A t is the absorbance at cultivation 
time, t. Decolorization percentage reading 
refers to the percentage mean of 
decolorization percentage of three 
replicas. 
Efficiency of decolorization of reactive 
Blue 21 dye using free and immobilized 
fungal biomass 
Biomass immobilization: 
Pleurotus eryngii  was grown in 
glass bottles on different substrates like 
rice straw, wheat straw, sugar cane waste 
and wheat bran. The moisture content was 
adjusted to 75%. This substrate was steam 
sterilized at 121oC for 15 minutes and 
inoculated with P. eryngii . The cultures 
were incubated at 28oC until the 
mycelium covered the substrates. 
Decolorization of reactive Blue 21 dye 
The substrates covered with fungal 
mat were evenly homogenized under 
sterile conditions and equal amounts (5g 
of immobilized substrate) were used to 
inoculate 100 ml of sterilized tap water  91 Biodegradation of textile dyes waste water by Pleurotus eryngii  
 
containing 50 mg/l of reactive Blue 21 
dye which was selected as the most 
decolorized dye more than other dye. 
Control with substrates without fungal 
mat. Incubation was carried at different 
periods (4, 6, 8, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours), 
agitation rate and temperature were 150 
rpm and 30oC, respectively (Yang et al., 
2003). 
Screening different enzymes activity of 
Pleurotus eryngii  for decolorization of 
reactive Blue 21 dye 
Extraction of Extracellular enzymes  
Samples of sugar cane straw 
covered with fungal mat were extracted in 
phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) for ligninolytic 
enzymes. Filtrated extract was used for 
enzyme assay according to Wood and 
Goodenough (1977) . 
Enzyme assay 
Laccase 
Guaiacol has been reported as 
efficient substrate for laccase assay, the 
intense brown color development due to 
oxidation of guaiacol by laccase can be 
correlated to its activity. The reaction 
mixture was prepared in test tubes each 
containing a volume of 3 ml acetate 
buffer (10 mM pH 5.0), 1ml guaiacol (2 
mM) and 1 ml enzyme extract and 
enzyme blank contained 1ml of distilled 
water instead of enzyme source. The total 
volume of the reaction mixture was 5ml, 
the mixture was incubated at 30ºC for 1 
hours and absorbance was read at 450 nm 
using UV spectrophotometer, enzyme 
activity was expressed in units/ml/min 
(Sandhu and Arors, 1985). 
Manganese dependent peroxidase  
Manganese peroxidase  (MnP) 
activity was determined according to 
Bonnen et al. (1994). The assay solution 
contained 1 mM guaiacol, and 1 mM MnSO 4 in 10 mM citrate phosphate buffer 
(pH 5.5). The reaction was initiated by the 
addition of 0.5 ml of H 2O2 (1 mM) . After 
incubation at room temperature for 10 
minutes, the change in absorbance due to 
the oxidation of guaiacol was monitored 
at 465 nm. 
Peroxidase  
The activity of peroxidase was 
assayed according to Kato and Shimizu 
(1987). A sample of 3 ml of the reaction 
mixture containing 1.5 ml of 0.1 M 
sodium phosphate buffer (pH 5.8), 0.7 ml 
of 7.2 mM guaiacol, 0.7 ml of 11.8 mM 
H2O2 and 0.1 ml enzyme extract was used 
for the assay. By the addition of H 2O2, the 
reaction was initiated and the change in 
the absorbance was measured at 470 nm. 
Enzyme activity was expressed in units of 
mM/g /min. 
Catechol oxidase 
Three ml buffered catechol solution 
was added to the clean cuvette of 
spectrophotometer (0.01 M catechol 
freshly prepared in 0.1 M phosphate 
buffer pH 6). The spectrophotometer was 
adjusted to read absorbance at 495 nm. 
The cuvette chamber of 
spectrophotometer and absorbance was 
adjusted to zero. 1ml of the enzyme 
extract was added to the cuvette, the 
changes in absorbance were recorded for 
every 5 min up to 30 min. The increasing 
absorbance values were plotted from the 
linear phase of the curve, the increase was 
determined in optical density per/minute.  
FTIR analysis 
FTIR spectra were obtained in 
transmission mode using Gasco model 
4100 LE device, in the mid infra-red 
region of 400–4,000 cm-1 at the Micro-
analytical unite, Faculty of Science, Tanta 
University, Tanta, Egypt. The samples  92 Eman H.F. Abd El-Zaher   et al (2019)  
before and after treatment with the tested 
fungi were ground with KBr and pressed 
into transparent disk and analyzed. 
Application of immobilized Pleurotus 
eryngii on industrial textile effluents : 
The ability of  Pleurotus eryngii  
mycelia immobilized on sugar cane waste 
to remove color of single dye efficiently 
does not indicate the suitability of this 
organism in treatment of colored textile 
effluents. In order to detect the efficiency 
of P. eryngii  to decolorize textile 
effluents, the textile effluents were 
collected in sterile containers from a 
company for textile dyeing and printing 
located in El-Mahalla El-Kubra, Gharabia 
Governomate, Egypt. Samples were 
obtained at the end of a dying process of 
cotton, pH 10 and were stored at 4°C for 
use within 24 h. The absorbance 
maximum was detected using a 
spectrophotometer T80. Parameters as 
pH, total dissolved solid (TDS), total 
suspended solid (TSS), electric 
conductivity (EC), chemical oxygen 
demand (COD) and biological oxygen 
demand (BOD) were measured in textile 
effluent before and after treatment with 
immobilized P. eryngii mycelium on 
sugar cane waste.  
Efficiency of using treated textile 
effluent on basil plant germination:  
After germination and reach to yield 
stage, whole basil plant was washed 
thoroughly to get rid of any soil particles. 
The morphometric parameters as root and 
shoot length were measured, root and 
shoot were separated and weighed 
immediately (fresh weight) then dried in 
oven at 40oC for five days to determine 
dry weight, also inflorescence length and 
inflorescence fresh weight were 
measured. Biochemical parameters as total carbohydrates, photosynthetic 
pigment and total protein were estimated 
in plant. 
2.11. Statistical analysis 
The obtained results were 
statistically analyzed by one way and 
Duncan analysis of variance (ANOVA) to 
determine the degree of significance 
between the treatments using SPSS 18 
software. Significance was set at P < 0.05 
and all results were triplicated ( Pipkin, 
1984). 
Results and discussion 
Dye decolorization activity of 
Pleurotus eryngii  was screened for seven 
dyes with the final dye concentration of 
50 mg l-1. Fig (1) show the efficiency of 
P. eryngii  to decolorize different kinds of 
dyes: reactive Blue 21, reactive Yellow 
160, reactive Orange 122, direct Congo 
red, direct Yellow 5G, acid Methyl orange 
and  acid Eriochrome black T and the 
ability to decolorize textile dyes were 
screened on liquid medium. The dye Blue 
21 was decolorized more than the other 
six dyes where the decolorization 
percentage of Blue 21, Yellow 160, 
Orange 122, Congo red, Yellow 5G, 
Methyl orange and Black T were 98.4%, 
96.8%, 97.1%, 97.8%, 76%, 61.1% and 
96.9% respectively.  These results were 
correlated with that of Omar (2016) who 
reported that  Aspergillus  niger isolated 
from the soil samples around the textile 
distillery industries was evaluated for its 
efficiency in decolorization of different 
textile dyes; reactive red 198, reactive 
orange122, reactive yellow 160, reactive 
blue 21 and reactive blue 19 . Fungal 
biomass walls were composed of 
macromolecules which contain carboxyl 
amino, sulphates, and hydroxyl groups 
which act as metal sorption sites 
(Coulibaly, et al., 2003), and they are  93 Biodegradation of textile dyes waste water by Pleurotus eryngii  
 
able to produce an array of enzymes to 
enable them to grow under a variety of 
conditions. The decolorization efficiency 
of fungi can be due the presence of chitin 
with hydroxyl and amino groups in their 
cell wall, which make them an efficient 
adsorbent of dye effluent ( Manikandan 
et al., 2012). Difference in the capacity of 
dye decolorization between fungi had 
been related to inter and intraspecific 
variations, the molecular complexity of 
the dye and culture conditions ( Ramya et 
al., 2007). 
Decolorization efficiency of reactive 
Blue 21 dye using free and immobilized 
fungal biomass 
The decolorization of Blue 21 dye 
by free and immobilized Pleurotus eryngii  
on different substrates were increased with 
increasing incubation periods up to 84 h 
and the maximum decolorization was 
reached after 72 h. Fig (2) shows the 
decolorization percentage in case of free 
P. eryngii  was 50.8%, but decolorization 
percentage increased using immobilized 
mycelia of P. eryngii. The decolorization 
percentage of  P. eryngii immobilized on  
wheat straw, rice straw, sugar cane waste 
and wheat bran were 57.5, 32.5, 83.5 and 
62.2 % respectively. Przysta et al. (2018) 
were used different natural and synthetic 
solid supports for immobilization of 
fungal biomass. Among the different 
tested supports the best growth of P. 
ostreatus was observed on the sawdust, 
brush and polypropylene washer because 
the supports may take part in the 
decolorization process and the level of 
adsorption on them was estimated for 
tested dyes. Fungal immobilization 
represents several applicative advantages 
such as treatment of large volumes of 
waste water and allowing the persistent in 
competition with faster growing species 
(Tavcar et al., 2006). Screening different enzymes activity of 
Pleurotus eryngii  for decolorization of 
reactive Blue 21 dye 
Use of  Pleurotus eryngii  as dye 
biodegrader or decolorizer has been 
studied in this report and the efficient 
decolorization may be attributed to either 
through the action of extracellular 
enzymes such as laccase, Mn peroxidase, 
peroxidase and catechol oxidase and 
biosorption by the fungal biomass.  Fig (3) 
showed that fungus P. eryngii  produced 
laccase, Mn peroxidase, peroxidase and 
catechol oxidase enzymes. The activity 
increased with increasing incubation 
periods, a maximum activity of enzymes 
observed after 12 days of incubation and 
their activity were as follow 4.55, 1.37, 
0.023 and 0.035  U/min/ml respectively. 
Many studies have demonstrated 
that white rot fungi can degrade a wide 
variety of structurally diverse dyes such 
as azo, anthraquinone, heterocyclic, 
triphenylmethane and polymeric dyes due 
to the lignin degrading system enzymes: 
lignin-peroxidase (LiP), manganese-
peroxidase (MnP) and laccase ( Cripps et 
al. 1990; Vicuna et al. 1993; Heinfling  et 
al. 1998).  
These lignin-degrading enzymes are 
directly involved not only in the 
degradation of lignin in their natural 
lignocellulosic substrates but also in the 
degradation of various xenobiotic 
compounds, including dyes. Moreover, 
ligninolytic enzymes have been reported 
to oxidize many recalcitrant substances 
such as chlorophenols, polycyclic 
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organo-
phosphorus compounds, and phenols 
(Wesenberg et al., 2003). 
FTIR analysis  94 Eman H.F. Abd El-Zaher   et al (2019)  
Fourier transform infrared 
spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis of 
decolorization products showed that there 
were significant differences between the 
spectra of pure blue 21 dyes and those 
after  exposed to fungal treatment ( Fig. 
4). 
FTIR analysis of the pure dye Blue 
21 showed peak at υ3455.81 cm-1 for the –
OH stretching indicating presence of 
alcohol group and peaks at 3190 and 
1467.56 cm-1 indicating presence of 
aromatic rings. Peak at υ 2924.52 cm-1 
indicates the presence of - -CH 2 aliphatic 
gp presence in original dye. Also peak at 
υ 1635.34 cm-1 indicate stretching for C=N 
attached to aromatic ring (pyrol ring) but 
peak at υ 1500.35 indicate presence of 
C=N not attached to aromatic ring (azo-
methine gp). The peak at υ1191.79 cm -1 
was for –SO 3 stretching. FTIR analysis 
indicates that the pure dye molecule was 
complex molecule with presence of OH, 
SO3, -C=C, -C=N, groups ( Fig. 4 a). 
after treatment with Pleurotus 
eryngii FTIR analysis of the product gave 
a band at υ 3,365 cm−1 that corresponds to 
the NH group that is not present in the 
spectrum of and the band at υ 1500.35 of 
C=N azo-methine gp was disappeared this 
confirm that the C=N was broken and NH 
was formed. Also analysis showed that 
there was disappearance of the peaks at υ 
2924.52, υ 1191.79 and υ 1467.56 cm-1 of 
-CH2, –SO3 and C=C of aromatic ring 
respectively ( Fig. 4 b). 
From the FTIR analysis it was 
concluded that the decolorization of 
reactive Blue 21 dye was by means of 
degradation which causes changes in the 
molecular orientation of the pure dye 
molecule, it results in the formation of the 
different fragments indicated by the 
formation of new peaks and disappeared 
of some peaks in FTIR spectra It was concluded that all changes in 
υ of the original dye of reactive Blue 21 
treated with P. eryngii  indicated the 
ability of fungi not only to decolorizes the 
azo dye but also degrade dyes. 
Jadhav et al. (2007) concluded 
from FTIR analysis that S. cerevisiae 
MTCC 463 effectively decolourizes 
methyl red in to the fragments by 
biodegradation 
Application of immobilized Pleurotus 
eryngii on industrial textile effluent : 
Among the various industrial 
effluents, the textile and the dye industry 
waste play a significant role in water 
pollution. Discharge of these effluents 
into aquatic systems not only causes 
formation of toxic aromatic amines under 
anaerobic conditions but also have an 
adverse effect in terms of chemical 
oxygen demand in the receiving media. 
Further, many of these dyes are toxic, 
mutagenic and carcinogenic besides 
interfering with the transmission of 
sunlight and reducing photosynthetic 
activity ( Chung and Stevens, 1993 and 
Campos et al., 2001) 
In the present investigation, 
Pleurotus eryngii  significantly reduced 
the color from the dye effluent at 
immobilized conditions; about 96% 
removal of color was recorded. Also 
nearly 85 to 90% reductions of various 
nutrients including BOD and COD were 
achieved and the removal efficiency of 
TSS, TDS, and EC were 79, 37 and 38% 
respectively. These results indicate that all 
the parameters recorded a decrease in 
their levels compared to the control. This 
shows that immobilized P. eryngii  on 
sugar cane waste have the ability to treat 
textile waste water fig (5). In parallel to 
our results Arumugam  and Sivakami  95 Biodegradation of textile dyes waste water by Pleurotus eryngii  
 
(2016) studied the treatment of dye 
industry effluent using immobilized 
bacteria and fungi and the study indicated 
promising results for removal for many of 
the parameters estimated. 
Efficiency of using treated textile 
effluent on basil plant germination:  
This experiment aimed to 
investigate the ability of reusing treated 
textile effluents in irrigation of plants The 
treated effluent by Pleurotus eryngii was 
used for irrigation of basil plant and 
controls represented irrigation by 
untreated effluent (-ve) and with tap water 
(+ve). Fig (6) and (7) revealed that the 
effect of treated effluent on plants 
compared to controls. It was clearly 
noticed that all treated effluent had 
pronounced effect on all measured 
physical parameters comparing to 
untreated wastewater. Irrigation with 
treated effluent by P. eryngii reflect a 
significant increase in shoot and root 
lengths, on other hand shoot and root 
fresh and dry weights, inflorescence 
length and inflorescence fresh weight 
increased comparing to irrigation with 
untreated effluent. Also Fig (8) revealed 
the effect of treated textile effluent on 
pigment content of basil plant comparing 
with controls. The reuse of treated textile 
effluent by P. eryngii  revealed a 
significant increase in chlorophyll (a), 
chlorophyll (b), carotenoid and total 
pigments comparing to untreated textile 
effluent. Effect of irrigation water types 
on protein and carbohydrate content of 
shoot and root of basil plant were studied.  
Fig (9) revealed that the plants were 
affected by treated oil wastewater 
compared to controls. It was obvious that 
all investigated treated oil waste water 
significantly increase root and shoot protein comparing to untreated oil waste 
water.  
The decreasing in the growth 
parameters, in some cases, of the basil 
plant under the effect of irrigation by 
textile effluent may attribute to the 
presence of dyes in wastewater which 
inhibition in growth and germination may 
have been due to the presence of heavy 
metals that cause toxicity at cellular as 
well as at the whole plant level (Kadar 
and Kastori, 2003) . Furthermore, 
presence of heavy metals in the growth 
medium also causes reduction in uptake 
of other essential nutrients thereby 
resulting in reduced growth. Also it could 
be observed that the irrigation by treated 
textile effluent enhanced the growth and 
productivity of basil plant compared to 
the untreated one. This may be due to the 
presence of nutrients in treated 
wastewater which may be considered as 
fertilizers capable of improving the crop 
yield but the use of untreated oil 
wastewater may present serious toxicity 
and sanitary problems (Griffin., 1981). 
 
Conclusion  
The current study indicates that the 
Pleurotus eryngii  has a great potential to 
decolorize and degrade dyes in the free 
and immobilized cases, also the fungus 
has significant effect in treatment 
industrial textile effluents in immobilized 
case. The treated textile effluent was 
reused in irrigation of basil plant and it 
gave a good result which was nearly 
similar comparing to tap water.
