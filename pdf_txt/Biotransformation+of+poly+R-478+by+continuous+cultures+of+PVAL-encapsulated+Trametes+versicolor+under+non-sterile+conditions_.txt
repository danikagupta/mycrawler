1. Introduction
The degradation of persistent organic pollutants by white rot
fungi Phanerochaete chrysosporium was reported in 1985 [1].
Afterwards, Kirk [2]found out the nonspeciﬁcity of the lignin
peroxidase system produced by white rot fungi at the secondary
metabolism stage. White rot fungi can degrade lignin and many
organic pollutants, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,
chloro-aromatics, dyes, dynamites and pesticides [3–5] . Shim and
Kawamoto reported the immobilization of P. chrysosporium in
bioreactor to degrade PCP [6]. The immobilized P. chrysosporium on
polyurethane foam and rotating biological contactor (RBC) with
polyethylene discs degraded more than 90% 4-chlorophenol in
three repeated batches. Couto et al. [7]studied the decoloration of
different synthetic dyes with white rot fungi Trametes hirsuta in an
expanded-bed reactor and reported the high decoloration rate
with hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 3 days.Almost all the studies using white rot fungi for the treatment of
dye wastewater are of laboratory-scale and they performed well
under strict sterile conditions [8–11] . There was no successful
report with white rot fungi for various organic dye under non-
sterile conditions. The main reason is that white rot fungi were
low-grade eukaryotic micro-organisms and grow slowly compared
with bacteria. Once bacteria which grow and reproduce much
faster than white rot fungi invaded into the reaction system, they
could compete for nutrients with the white rot fungi andpredominate in the reaction system rapidly. As a result, white
rot fungi would stop growing further and lose the degradation
ability for dyestuffs in the entire processing system and the
invading bacteria exerted much impact on the secretion of
extracellular degradation enzymes [12]. Furthermore, it is
obviously unpractical to use the sterilization means (which are
used in laboratory) to prevent a full-scale reactor system from
bacterial contamination due to operational cost. Therefore, to
study the methods of using white rot fungi under non-sterile
conditions has important signiﬁcance and extensive value.
The application of white rot fungi for dye wastewater
treatment requires no or less bacterial contamination. In recent
years, researchers had already realized that the bacterial
contamination was a bottle-neck problem for the developmentProcess Biochemistry 43 (2008) 937–944

White rot fungi is capable of oxidizing many persistent organic pollutants including dyes. The application
of the fungi has been limited for wastewater treatment under non-sterile conditions due to the
contamination by bacteria and other micro-organisms. We developed a treatment approach by using
immobilized white rot fungi Phanerochaete chrysosporium to degrade reactive dye K-2BP under non-
sterile condition. Four different inert carriers were tested for immobilization of the white rot fungi withorthogonal experiments in comparison with suspension culture. The activity of manganese peroxidase
(MnP) was used for the evaluation of oxidization performance in order to understand whether
contamination of bacteria and other micro-organisms was suppressed. Under non-sterile conditions, theimmobilized fungal cultures successfully restrained the growth of microzymes, coccies, and bacillus but
suspension culture was highly contaminated with poor MnP activity. Under non-sterile conditions,
higher MnP enzymatic activity (690 U/L vs. 125 U/L), higher decolorization efﬁciency (93.5% vs. 15%) andshorter reaction period (3 days vs. 6 days) were achieved in immobilized cultures in comparison with
suspension culture. With the immobilized fungal cultures, no difference was observed under non-sterile
and sterile conditions for the degradation of reactive dye K-2BP.

doi:10.1016/j.procbio.2008.04.026of technology of degrade dyes by white rot fungi, and they tried
to work on it [13,18] . Libra et al. [13] and our group’s previous
research [14] indicated that a nitrogen-limited medium could
effectively suppress bacterial growth in different white rot fungi
systems during dyestuff degradation. Bacterial growth can be
effectively suppressed by providing a low pH favorable for white
rot fungi [15], incubation method [9],i n j e c t i n gt i m eo fd y e s [16],
and the levels of trace element Fe [17] in order to enhance the
degradation efﬁciency by white rot fungi. Most of the above
research was performed with the growth of fungi ﬁrst under
sterile conditions for 4–5 days, and then using it for the
decolorization of dyestuff under non-sterile conditions. Leidig
et al. used PVAL hydrogel to embed the mycelia of Trametes
versicolor in order to avoid the fungi and extracellular enzyme
being attacked by bacteria under non-sterile conditions [18].
Leidig et al. also found out white rot fungi broken out of the
PVAL hydrogel beads easily. Therefore, selection of proper
carriers for the attached growth may help in the suppression of
bacterial growth and improvement of degradation efﬁciency of
persistent organic pollutants.
Based upon the literature review, immobilization may help
the white rot fungi growth and enhance enzyme production
with less contamination by other micro-organism. In order to
ﬁgure out a better way to apply white rot fungi for dye
wastewater treatment, in this study, P. chrysosporium was
incubated under non-sterile conditions in comparison with
sterile conditions. The aim of the study was to screen out anoptimal condition for immobilization of white fungi under
which bacterial growth is suppressed and decolorization of dyes
is enhanced. Four inert carriers were tested and orthogonal
experimental approach was employed.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Micro-organism
P. chrysosporium BKM-F-1767 was obtained from ESPC State Key Joint
Laboratory, Department of Environment Science and Engineering, TsinghuaUniversity, Beijing, China. The culture was maintained on potato–glucose–agarslants at 4 8C.
2.2. Culture media
2.2.1. Solid medium
(1)PDA medium: lixivium of potato 200 g/L, glucose 20 g/L, and
agar 20 g/L.
(2)Beef lotion and peptone medium: beef lotion 5.0 g/L, peptone10.0 g/L, Na
2Cl 5.0 g/L, and agar 15 g/L.
2.2.2. Liquid medium
The medium used for the growth of P. chrysosporium and decolorization was
prepared according to Tien and Kirk [19] with modiﬁcation. The medium contained
glucose, 10 g/L; ammonium tartrate, 0.8 g/L [20];K H 2PO4, 2 g/L; MgSO 4, 0.5 g/L;
CaCl 2, 0.1 g/L; veratryl alcohol, 0.22 mL [21]. Vitamin B1 was added under sterile
condition to obtain a concentration of 1 mg/L.2.3. Carriers
Four inert carriers having different physics structure and nature were used in the
experiments, i.e. stainless steel net (30 mesh, aperture 0.61 mm), polyamide ﬁbernet (30 mesh, aperture 0.4 mm), ﬁberglass net (14 mesh, aperture 1.3 mm), andpolyurethane foam (aperture 0.031 cm, density 0.039 g/cm
3). These carriers were
washed three times with distilled water, then dried at 60 8C and autoclaved at
121 8C for 20 min prior to use.
2.4. Dyestuff
The dye used in this research was Reactive brilliant red K-2BP, a disperse dye
which belongs to the class of diazo dyes. The initial concentration of the dye addedto the medium was 30 mg/L.
2.5. Culture condition
Inoculum was obtained on PDA slants at 37 8C for 6 days. The growth of cultures
(suspended cells and immobilized cells) was carried out in 250 mL Erlenmeyerﬂasks containing 100 mL of liquid medium in a reciprocating shaker (model TZ-
2EH) at 160 rpm and under 37 8C. The inoculum level was 2.5 /C210
6spores.
2.6. Experiment scheme design
2.6.1. Control experiments
The control experiments were conducted without carriers under three process
conditions: (a) incubation of P. chrysosporium and decolorization under sterile
conditions, (b) incubation under sterile conditions but decolorization under non-sterile conditions, and (c) incubation and decolorization under non-sterileconditions.
2.6.2. Immobilization experiments
The immobilization experiments were conducted with multifactors to optimize
treatment performance by the white fungi. In order to select the key factors foroptimization of the immobilized cultures incubation, an orthogonal experimental
approach was used for screening the growth conditions. The orthogonal
experiments were mainly composed of the evaluation index, the test factor, thelevel of the test factor and the orthogonal table.
The test factor was interpreted as reasons or elements, which might inﬂuence the
characteristic value of the evaluation indexes. From relevant results [22], the
material, weight, quantity, size, and shape of the carriers were the main factorsinﬂuencing immobilized white rot fungi to produce enzyme. To combine thephysical structure characteristics of the inert carriers selected in this research, the
test factors were conﬁrmed as carrier material, size, quantity, and shape.
The orthogonal table of L
9(34) was used according to the number of factors and
corresponding level. The experiment was completed with two orthogonal tables,because there were great differences in structure characteristics between reticularcarrier and polyurethane foam. The list of factors and levels were reported inTable 1 .
All experiments were carried out in triplicate, and the results were expressed as
the mean values.
2.7. Analytical methods
Manganese peroxidase (MnP) activity was measured as described by Paszczynski
et al. [23]. One unit (U) of MnP was deﬁned as the amount of enzyme necessary to
oxidize 1.0
mmol Mn(II) to Mn(III) per minute.
Laccase (Lac) activity was measured as described by Bourbonnais and Paice [24].
One unit (U) of Lac was deﬁned as the amount of enzyme necessary to oxidize1.0
mmol ABTS per minute.
Glucose concentration in the liquid medium was determined enzymatically
using a commercially available assay kit (Inﬁnity Glucose Reagent, Sigma).

methods [25].
The H 2O2was determined by the method of Pick colorimetry [26].
The dye concentration was measured spectrophotometrically at 533 nm
(SHIMADZU UVmini 1240, Japan). Decolorization is reported as % decolorizatio-n=( ( A
0/C0At)/A0)/C2100, where A0is the initial dye absorbance and Atis the dye
absorbance at time t.
The microscopic examination of liquid media was conducted daily using a
microscope (Motic B SERIES, Japan).
All samples were centrifuged at 9000 rpm for 10 min at 4 8C, and the supernatant
was analyzed.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. The optimal incubation strategy for immobilization3.1.1. The results of orthogonal experiments for optimal incubation
strategy
According to Libra et al. [13], the enzyme productivity of white
rot fungi was correlated with the bacteria infection, and decreased
evidently when the system was infected by bacteria under non-
sterile condition. The peroxidase enzyme can be used as an
evaluation index to screen the optimal strategy. As mentioned
previously, the limited nitrogen liquid culture (C/N = 56/8.7 mM)was used in this study. Therefore, only MnP produced was detected
while LiP was under detection limits as reported by other
researchers [27,28] . The result of MnP was shown in Tables 2 and 3 .
Using the data in Tables 2 and 3 , the optimal incubation
strategies of reticular carrier and polyurethane foam were
screened out from the three process conditions, i.e. (a) sterilized
incubation and sterilized degradation, (b) sterilized incubation andnon-sterilized degradation, and (c) non-sterilized incubation and
non-sterilized degradation. The results through orthogonal experi-
ments were A
2B2C3D1and A 2B3C1, respectively. Subsequently, it
was found that under the three process conditions, comparing the
results from single factor contrasting experiments ( Fig. 1 ), the MnP
levels of the two groups optimal incubation strategies were
evidently higher than suspended culture strategy of control test
obviously. In addition, the MnP of strategy A 2B3C1was also clearly
higher than strategy A 2B2C3D1clearly. The best optimal incubation
strategy A 2B3C1was carrier material, polyurethane foam; the size
of carrier, 1.0 cm /C21.0 cm /C21.0 cm; the weight of carrier, 1.2 g;
the shape of carrier, three prismatoid.
3.1.2. Suppression of bacterial growth
The test showed that the optimal incubation strategy had
suppressed bacterial growth better than suspended culture
strategy under non-sterile condition. On the third day, the liquid
medium of suspended culture system was turbid (OD 650= 0.502)
under non-sterile condition, and the white rot fungi grew poorly.
The liquid medium of the optimal incubation system was still clear
(OD 650= 0.032), and the white rot fungi grew very well. In order to
further evaluate the suppressing bacteria effect of the optimal
system, the liquid media of suspended culture system and the
optimal system under non-sterile condition were observed by
microscope. A lot of elliptic germ colonies were found in the
suspended culture. These organisms had slippery edge, had some
buds on surface, could not be discolored with alcohol after dyeing
by crystal violet, and the size of these colonies was
(2.5mm/C27.5mm)–(2.5 mm/C212.5mm). Then the cultivated testTable 2

and peptone. The result showed that the ﬂat cultivated germ
colony was ivory-white, approximated butter, slippery and humid.
The shape and size were equal to the germ colony in the turbid
liquid medium. The microscope observation and ﬂat cultivated test
could prove that the germ colony infecting was microzyme,otherwise, some bacteria such as coccies and bacillus were found
by microscope observation in the system after 6 days. On the
contrary, there was few microzyme and other bacteria were
observed in the medium of the optimal system under the non-
sterile condition.
3.2. The mechanism of suppressing bacterial growth3.2.1. Effect of pH
White rot fungi grew well slightly under acidic pH environ-
ment. The pH ﬂuctuates and trends to increase eventually when
the white rot fungi culture system was infected by bacteria under
non-sterile condition. The extent of pH change was inﬂuenced by
the variety and extent of infecting bacteria [20]. The variation of pH
had negative inﬂuence on the growth and reproduction of white
rot fungi.
The optimal incubation strategy maintained a stable pH range
of 4.0–5.0 in 10 days by restraining bacteria growth under non-
sterile condition ( Fig. 2 ). Thereby this ensured white rot fungi to
grow and reproduce well. However, under the non-sterile
condition, the pH of suspended culture system ﬂuctuated acutely
because of the contamination by microzyme. Eventually, the pH
rose to 7.0 from 4.8 after the system was inﬂuenced by coccies andbacillus at anaphase. This result showed that the optimal
incubation strategy could protect the system from bacterial
contamination and facilitated the growth of white rot fungi
effectively.
3.2.2. MnP and Lac production
The white rot fungi degrade lignin, and many persistent organic
pollutants [2,29,30] due to their lignin degrading enzyme systems.
Previous studies [9,14] have demonstrated that bacterial con-
tamination is a bottle-neck problem in application because the
enzyme production was inhibited in the presence of bacterial
contamination. In this study, we tested enzymatic activities of LiP,
MnP, and Lac in both immobilized and suspended cultures under
sterile and non-sterile conditions ( Fig. 3 ). Under non-sterile
condition, the immobilized white rot fungi grown with the
optimal strategy showed much better performance in comparison
with the control (suspended culture strategy). First, the enzyme
activities were enhanced. The maximum level of MnP and Lac in
the suspended culture was 125 U/L and 0.5 U/L, respectively, while
the maximum activities of MnP and Lac in the immobilized
cultures were up to 690 U/L and 24 U/L, respectively. The levels in
the immobilized cultures were approximately 5 and 48 times than
that in the suspended culture as observed previously [31].
Secondly, the enzymatic activity reached peak earlier. The peaklevels of MnP and Lac in the suspended culture appeared on the 7
day and 4 day, respectively. The peak levels of MnP and Lac in the
immobilized cultures were observed on the third day. The
appearance of the peak levels was accordant to the time of
complete consumption of total nitrogen. The increased enzyme

sterile condition.D. Gao et al. / Process Biochemistry 43 (2008) 937–944 940activities and early peak level of enzymatic activity are likely due
to the predominance of white rot fungi in the immobilized cultures
using the optimal incubation strategy selected in this study. Using
the optimal strategy, though the white rot fungi were cultivated
under non-sterile condition, the enzyme activities and peak levels
of MnP and Lac were the same as under sterile condition. It was
obvious that the optimal strategy had suppressed bacterial growth.
In addition, the limited nitrogen liquid culture (C/N = 56/
8.7 mM) medium was used in this study. Therefore, no LiP was
detected as reported [32,33] . The reason of no LiP in the limited
nitrogen condition might be that the mass transfer of oxygen was
counterchecked due to white rot fungi excreting overmuch
extracellular amylose in the superﬂuous carbon condition, thereby
the composing of LiP was inﬂuenced. On the contrary, the high
enzyme activities LiP could be obtained in the limited carbon
condition [32]. According to characteristic that the different rates
of C/N inﬂuenced the immobilized white rot fungi producing
enzymes of LiP and MnP in air, we could control the corresponding
enzyme production effectively.
3.2.3. Carbon and nitrogen consumption processes
Fig. 4 showed that white rot fungi consumed the nutrients of
carbon and nitrogen under different conditions. As shown inFig. 4 (a), there were three phases in glucose consumption under
non-sterile condition. The consumption rate of glucose was low on
the initial stage (in 0–2 days), then glucose was consumed rapidly
by 5 days or 8 days. Afterward the cultivation process was in no
carbon state. This observation was similar to other reports [33].The consumption of total nitrogen was basically the same as that of
glucose ( Fig. 4 (b)), but consumption rate of total nitrogen was
faster than that of glucose. The total nitrogen in both immobilized
and suspended cultures dropped below detection limits on third
and fourth days, respectively. At that time the production of the
lignin degrading enzymes increased rapidly. This observation may
correlate to adopt the limited nitrogen culture (C/N = 56/8.7) in the
experiment. When the total nitrogen was exhausted, white rot
fungi came into the secondary metabolism stage and began
excreting enzyme. As result, the enzyme peak appeared. In
addition, the consumption of glucose and total nitrogen in the
immobilized cultures were faster than the suspended culture
(Fig. 4 ). This may be due to that the polyurethane foam in the
immobilized cultures system had high surface area, therefore, the
fungi mycelium could extend to much large space, and grew and
reproduced better than that in suspended culture. This result was
also in accordance with the production of the MnP in the
immobilized cultures. The more rapid consumption of carbon
and nitrogen were, the more early white rot fungi came into the
secondary metabolism stage and began to excrete enzyme.
As shown in Fig. 4 , under both sterile condition and non-sterile
condition, the patterns of consumption of glucose and total
nitrogen under immobilized conditions were basically the same.
This was likely because the optimal incubation strategy sup-
pressed bacterial growth effectively, thereby white rot fungi grew
predominantly even under non-sterile condition. Therefore, the
patterns of enzymatic activities were also similar under bothsterile and non-sterile conditions.
3.2.4. H
2O2excretion
White rot fungi have special ability to degrade lignin but the
mechanism of degradation is complicated. Under carbon and
nitrogen-limited conditions, white rot fungi excrete peroxidases.
Under oxygenous condition, the Fe3+in these peroxidases was
oxidized after being activated by H 2O2excreted by white rot fungi
itself, thereby the catalysis reactions of these peroxidases were
activated, and then the lignin was degraded and oxidized to CO 2
and H 2O[34]. Therefore, the production of H 2O2is important in the
biodegradation process by white rot fungi [19].
Decolorization of the dyes with the lignin peroxide enzyme
requires extra H 2O2. Lopez et al. [35] demonstrated that joined
different amounts of H 2O2inﬂuenced the decolorization effect.
However, how much H 2O2the fungi excreted and what the rules of
the fungi excreting H 2O2were during incubating white rot fungi,

sterile condition.D. Gao et al. / Process Biochemistry 43 (2008) 937–944 941were few reported. Fig. 5 shows the white rot fungi excreted H 2O2
under various culture conditions. H 2O2was detected steadily
during the whole incubating process in the immobilized and
suspended cultures, under sterile or non-sterile conditions. There
was a similar pattern that the peak appeared at the early stage of
incubation (by 2–3 days), where the levels reached up to 3–4 mM.
Subsequently, the levels descended slightly and then tended
stable, at about 2 mM all the time, and ﬁnally dropped on 9 days. As
shown in Fig. 5 ,H2O2levels with the optimal incubation strategy
were slightly higher than that in the suspended culture strategy
under non-sterile condition. The immobilized cultures strategy
was favorable for the growth of white rot fungi and stimulated the
fungi to excrete H 2O2. With the optimal strategy, the patterns of
H2O2production under both sterile and non-sterile conditions
were almost the same ( Fig. 5 ). The optimal strategy restrained the
bacteria growth under non-sterile condition effectively, and
consequently reduced the inﬂuence of bacteria on excreting H 2O2.
Our previous research indicated that the H 2O2level was a
limiting factor of inﬂuencing decolorization of dyes by white rot
fungi because H 2O2was used as an electron acceptor or oxidant for
the decolorization. Based on the results in this study and previous
results by addition of H 2O2for decolorization, it was estimated that
if in a treatment system dyes were degraded by LiP, a high
decolorization rate could be obtained when H 2O2amount reached
4–5 mol; if dyes were degraded using MnP, an appropriate H 2O2
level would be 3–4 mol. Because of the instability of the H 2O2, the
optimal H 2O2level for the degradation of dyes may vary depending
on the process applied and environmental conditions [36,37] .
3.3. Decolorization of dye
The experiments of dye decolorization by white rot fungi under
different conditions were carried out in order to understand the
performance of suppressing bacteria and operational parameters
with the optimal incubation strategy screened out. As described
previously, the optimal incubation strategy provided a favorable
condition for the growth and reproduction of the fungi and
enhanced enzymatic activities. We found that this strategy also
enhanced the performance of decolorization.
3.3.1. Decolorization efﬁciency
Previous study indicated that the decolorization performance
by the fungi was poor if the dye was added to the treatment
systems after MnP and H 2O2passed their peak levels [15]. Based on
the results of the peak level of MnP and H 2O2observed, we decided
to add the dye before the peak was reached to maximize the
decolorization efﬁciency, i.e. the dye was added to the immobilized
fungal cultures after incubation for 2 days. The performance ofdecolorization by the immobilized P. chrysosporium was compared
with the suspended cultures to which dye was added after
incubation for 5 days. Three test conditions were used: (a)
sterilized culture and sterilized degradation, (b) sterilized culture
and non-sterilized degradation, and (c) non-sterilized culture and
non-sterilized degradation.
As shown in Fig. 6 , the decolorization efﬁciency by the
suspended culture strategy was more than 80% when the cultures
grew under sterile conditions but less than 20% when the culture
grew under non-sterile condition. The decolorization efﬁciencies of
immobilized cultures under three conditions were identical,
reaching greater than 90%. The incubation time to reach the peak
activity was only 2 days for the immobilized cultures in
comparison with 5 days for the suspended cultures. The short
incubation time would reduce the operational cost for a waste-
water treatment system.
3.3.2. Decolorization and restraining contamination
The suspended culture maintained under sterile conditions
decolorized dye effectively with up to 89% efﬁciency 1 day after
adding dye ( Fig. 6 (a)). When the white rot fungi grew under sterile
condition but degraded the dye under non-sterile condition, the
decolorization efﬁciency was slightly lower ( Fig. 6 (b), up to 80% on
the third day. A few microzymes and bacteria grew in the culture
after the incubation was switched from sterile to non-sterile
condition. The suspended culture grew under non-sterile condition
and maintained under non-sterile condition for the dye degrada-tion showed poor decolorization performance ( Fig. 6 (c)). Only 18%
of dye removal efﬁciency was obtained during initial 8 h and then
remained unchanged. This low removal efﬁciency of dye may be
mainly caused by the adsorption to fungi cells rather than
degradation. The poor performance was likely caused by the
growth of microzymes, coccies, and bacillus in the system under
non-sterile condition culture. They grew faster than P. chrysospor-
iumand competed for nutrients and substrates, and P. chrysospor-
iumwas inhibited for growth and enzyme production, resulting in
poor decolorization efﬁciency.
The immobilized cultures grew with the optimal incubation
strategy showed high decolorizartion efﬁciency regardless under
sterile or non-sterile conditions. As shown in Fig. 6 (a), under sterile
culture condition and sterile degradation condition, the decolor-
ization efﬁciency by the immobilized cultures reached to 73% and
95% in 1 and 3 days, respectively, even slightly higher than
suspended culture. Under sterile culture condition and non-sterile
degradation condition, the immobilized cultures also achieved
high decolorization efﬁciency which was 72.9% on day 1 and 94%
on day 3. These efﬁciencies were higher than that of the suspended
culture. Although P. chrysosporium was incubated only for 2 days

incubation of P. chrysosporium under non-sterile condition.D. Gao et al. / Process Biochemistry 43 (2008) 937–944 942under sterile condition, then adding dye under non-sterile
condition, P. chrysosporium had been preponderant strain in the
decolorization system in the 2 days with high decolorization
performance. On the contrary, the decolorization efﬁciency of the
suspended culture descended obviously due to interferences by a
few bacteria. The immobilized cultures, which was cultivated
under sterile condition and then added with dye under non-sterile
condition, had not only shorter sterile incubation time, but also
effective decolorization of dye.
The immobilized P. chrysosporium cultures grown and subse-
quently decolorized dye under non-sterile conditions showed high
decolorization efﬁciency of 69% on day 1 and 93.5% on day 3. The
efﬁciency was the same as those of the immobilized cultures
grown under sterile conditions but much better than those of the
suspended cultures. Also, the total operational period was reduced
to 3 days. Microscopic examination indicated the suspended
culture under non-sterile condition for both the cultivated phase
and the dye degradation phase, the dominate species were
microzymes, coccies, and bacillus. In contrast, the bacterial
infection in the immobilized cultures under non-sterile condition
was limited and the white rot fungi remained preponderant strain
all the time. Only at the end of dye degradation, a small number of
coccies and bacillus was observed.
In summary, under non-sterile condition, the immobilized
cultures showed high decolorization efﬁciency with short opera-
tional time compared with the suspended culture. This demon-
strated that immobilized white rot fungi could be used for dyedegradation under non-sterile condition. More studies are still
needed to develop and scale-up the process with the immobilized
white rot fungi for real wastewater.
4. Conclusions
(1)The optimal incubation strategy for immobilized fungal
cultures was screened out from the three processes, namely
(a) sterilized culture and sterilized degradation, (b) sterilized
culture and non-sterilized degradation, and (c) non-sterilized
culture and non-sterilized degradation. This was achieved
using multifactor orthogonal experiments and single factor
contrasting experiments with MnP as the evaluation indicator.
The strategy included use of polyurethane foam as carrier, the
size of carrier of 1.0 cm /C21.0 cm /C21.0 cm, the weight of carrier
of 1.2 g, and three prismatoid shaped carrier.
(2)Under non-sterile condition, the immobilized cultures sup-pressed the bacterial growth effectively. But suspended culture
was infected by microzymes, coccies, and bacillus in 3 days.
(3)Under non-sterile condition, the immobilized cultures main-tained stable pH of 4.0–5.0 in 10 days but the suspended
culture did not.
(4)Under non-sterile condition, the immobilized cultures had highenzymatic activity and short incubation time to reach peak
level of the enzymes. MnP was up to 683 U/L, being ﬁve times of
that in suspended culture. The peak level of the enzyme was
attained earlier by 4 days. The consumption of carbon and total
organic nitrogen was higher than that in suspended culture.
(5)Under non-sterilized culture and non-sterilized degradation,because of being infected by microzymes and bacteria, the
decolorization efﬁciency of the suspended culture was as pooras 15%. In contrast, the immobilized cultures had high
decolorization efﬁciency, which reached 69% in 1 day and
93.5% in 3 days. The decolorization efﬁciency of the
immobilized cultures was the same under both sterile and
non-sterile conditions. The incubation time for the decolor-
ization was reduced by 3 days when compared to the
suspended culture.Acknowledgements
