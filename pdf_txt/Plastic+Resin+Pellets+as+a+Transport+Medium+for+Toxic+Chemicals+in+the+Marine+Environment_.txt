Plastic resin pellets (small granules 0.1 -0.5 centimeters
in diameter) are widely distributed in the ocean all over the
world. They are an industrial raw material for the plastic
industry and are unintentionally released to the environmentboth during manufacturing and transport. They aresometimes ingested by seabirds and other marine organisms,
and their adverse effects on organisms are a concern.In the present study, PCBs, DDE, and nonylphenols (NP)
were detected in polypropylene (PP) resin pellets collectedfrom four Japanese coasts. Concentrations of PCBs (4 -
117 ng/g), DDE (0.16 -3.1 ng/g), and NP (0.13 -16μg/g) varied
among the sampling sites. These concentrations werecomparable to those for suspended particles and bottomsediments collected from the same area as the pellets. Field
adsorption experiments using PP virgin pellets demonstrated
significant and steady increase in PCBs and DDEconcentrations throughout the six-day experiment,indicating that the source of PCBs and DDE is ambient
seawater and that adsorption to pellet surfaces is
the mechanism of enrichment. The major source of NP inthe marine PP resin pellets was thought to be plasticadditives and/or their degradation products. Comparison
of PCBs and DDE concentrations in marine PP resin pellets
with those in seawater suggests their high degree ofaccumulation (apparent adsorption coefficient: 10
5-106).
The high accumulation potential suggests that plastic resin
pellets serve as both a transport medium and a potentialsource of toxic chemicals in the marine environment.
Introduction
Plastic resin pellets are small granules generally with the
shape of a cylinder or a disk with a diameter of a fewmillimeters. These plastic particles are industrial raw materialtransported to manufacturing sites where “user plastics” aremade by remelting and molding into the final products. Resin
pellets can be unintentionally released to the environment,both during manufacturing and transport. The released resin
pellets are carried by surface runoff, stream, and river waterseventually to the ocean. Resin pellets can also be directlyintroduced to the ocean through accidental spills duringshipping. Because of their environmental persistence, theyare distributed widely in the ocean and found on beachesand on water surfaces all over the world (1-6). A growing
production of plastic leads to a measurable increase in plasticpollution in the ocean. A significant increase in concentra-tions of plastic particles, including resin pellets, in the sea-
surface has been observed in the North Pacific from the 1970s
to the late 1980s (4, 7) .
Some studies in 1970s reported that marine plastic resin
pellets contain polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (2, 8) . They
were either adsorbed from ambient seawater or came fromplasiticizers used until the 1970s in most countries, althoughneither hypothesis has been proven conclusively. Manyspecies of marine organisms (e.g., seabirds) accumulate largenumbers of plastic particles in their stomachs (8-16).I ti s
thought that they ingest plastic particles not only accidentally
but also selectively by mistaking them for food (12, 14) .A n
increase in the frequency and quantity of plastic ingested byseabirds has been reported, which reflects the increase inplastic pollution in the ocean (15). In this context, there is
concern about the possible transfer of PCBs and otherpollutants from ingested plastics to organisms and subse-quent adverse effects (8-10, 17) . A positive correlation
between the mass of ingested plastics and PCB concentrationsin fat tissue of Great Shearwaters Puffinus gravis has been
documented (18). Plastic resin pellets may serve as a carrier
of toxic chemicals in the marine environment.
Limited information about the nature and sources of
chemicals contained in the marine plastic pellets has beenreported. There are two plausible mechanisms by whichchemicals are incorporated in the marine plastic pellets. Oneis adsorption of hydrophobic chemicals (e.g., PCBs) ontoplastic resin pellet surfaces from seawater because of thelow polarity (i.e., hydrophobic nature) of the plastic surfaces(19). Plastic resin pellets may act like hydrophobic adsorbents
in the sea. Another plausible mechanism may be plasticadditives and related chemicals contained with resins. Various
synthetic chemicals are contained in plastic resin pellets as
additives, and some are potentially harmful to wildlife. PCBsare one class of chemicals that had been identified in marineplastic pellets (2, 8 ), and their source(s) have not yet been
confirmed by experimental data. The lack of the informationis partly due to the fact that their basic composition is highlyvariable, and analytical procedures are under development.Marine plastic pellets consist of various types of polymers(e.g., polypropylene, polyethylene, polystyrene) having dif-ferent surface structures and, therefore, different affinities
to pollutants. Each polymer type contains different additives.
The present study has focused on polypropylene (PP)
pellets, one common type of pellet found in the ocean (2, 6) ,
using near-infrared spectroscopy for selecting the polymer.First, we have examined the conditions for extraction of PCBs,DDE, and nonylphenol (NP) through repeated Soxhletextraction using different organic solvents. These contami-nants have been selected as target compounds because PCBsand DDE are hydrophobic and widely distributed in the
ocean, whereas nonylphenol and/or its derivatives are used
as additives for plastics (20). PCBs and DDE are well-known
toxic chemicals. Toxicity of NP is currently a concern, becausetheir endocrine disrupting activities have been recentlyrevealed (21-24). We have determined the concentrations
and distribution patterns of these toxic chemicals in PP resin

Finally, the sources and chemical forms of the pollutants inthe PP plastic pellets have been studied in a field adsorptionexperiment and the repeated extraction.
Materials and Methods
Collection of Resin Pellets. Resin pellets were collected from
four coastal sites in Japan (Figure 1); Kasai Seaside Park andKeihin Canal in Tokyo Bay, Kugenuma Beach facing thePacific Ocean, and Shioda Beach facing the Sea of Japan in1997 and 1998. At Kasai Seaside Park, Kugenuma Beach, andShioda Beach, resin pellets were collected on the beaches
just above the high tide line. The resin pellets were picked
up one by one from the sand surface using solvent-rinsedstainless tweezers or by hand using polyethylene gloves, priortesting confirmed that no residues of PCBs, DDE, and NPwere leached from the gloves. At Shioda Beach the resinpellets were sampled using bare hands. Differentiation ofthe plastic resin pellets from sands and other materials weremade by eye in the field and confirmed by infraredspectroscopy in the laboratory. At Keihin Canal the pelletsfloating on the water surface were collected using a solvent-
rinsed stainless steel net. The samples were stored in pre-
baked glass bottles at -30°C until analysis.
Before chemical analysis, collected samples were classified
according to their polymer types (e.g. polypropylene, poly-ethylene, polystyrene) using near-infrared spectroscopy forplastics (PlaScan-SH, OPT Research Inc. Tokyo, Japan), andPP resin pellets were retained for chemical analysis. Duringthe classification, the resin pellets were handled using solvent-rinsed stainless steel tweezers.
Chemical Analysis. All solvents were distilled in glass. All
glassware was rinsed with methanol, dichloromethane
(DCM), and distilled hexane several times and/or baked at380-400 °C to remove organic contamination.
PP resin pellets taken from sea-surface were dried for 3
days in a clean room before extraction. One gram (dry weight)of PP resin pellets was extracted by Soxhlet extraction withhexane for more tha n8ha t5 -10 cycles/h. Fine plastic
particles in the extract were removed by passage throughquartz wool. PCBs, DDE, and NP in the extracts were purified
and fractionated by methods described elsewhere (25, 26) .
Briefly, the organic extracts were fractionated using 5% H
2O
deactivated silica gel column chromatography. PCBs +DDE
and NP were eluted with hexane/DCM (75:25) and hexane/DCM (35:65), respectively. Hexane/DCM (75:25) eluent wasfurther fractionated using fully activated silica gel column
chromatography to obtain a PCBs +DDE fraction. PCBs +DDE
and NP were determined by capillary gas chromatographequipped with electron capture detector and mass detector,respectively (26, 27) . The PCBs concentration was calculated
from the sum of 23 major congeners ( ∑PCB; IUPAC no. 8/5,28, 52, 44, 66/95, 90/101, 110/77,118, 132/153, 105, 138/160,
187, 128, 180, 170/190, 206) based on 16 chromatographicpeaks. NP concentration is expressed as the sum of 11chromatographic peaks ( ∑NP).
Reproducibility and recovery for the analytical procedure
were examined using plastic resin pellet extracts collectedfrom Kugenuma Beach. Reproducibility was determined byfour replicate analyses of the aliquots. Coefficient of variationof NP, PCBs, and DDE concentrations were 3.8%, 4.9%, and6.8%, respectively. Recovery was determined by analyzing
another set of four aliquot extracts to which the chemical
standards were spiked. The recoveries of NP, PCBs, and DDEwere 86.1%, 105%, and 90.8%, respectively.
Repeated Solvent Extraction. To optimize the extraction
condition and to study the interaction of pollutants with PPpellet surface and/or matrix, repeated extraction was con-ducted using hexane and methanol, respectively. PP resinpellets collected from the harbor of Tokyo University ofFisheries in the Tokyo Bay were used for the experiment.One gram of pellets was Soxhlet extracted twice (8 h each)with n-hexane, while anothe r 1 g sample was extracted three
times (8 h each) with methanol. The Soxhlet turnover ratewas set at 5 -10 cycles/h for hexane extraction and 3 -4
cycles/h for methanol extraction. The extracts from all these
tests were analyzed and compared.
Field Adsorption Experiment. A field adsorption experi-
ment, where virgin plastic pellets were deployed on the sea
surface, was conducted to examine whether plastic pelletscan adsorb hydrophobic pollutants from seawater. Theexperiment was carried out in Keihin Canal (Figure 1), whichis located in the Keihin industrial complex in Tokyo Bay, onDecember 16 -22, 1998. During this period, there were no
rainy or windy days, and the sea was calm. The watertemperature and salinity during the experiment were ∼12°C
and∼28‰.
Virgin PP resin pellets (products number: J104W) were
obtained from Grand Polymer Co. Ltd. Japan. Our prioranalysis showed no significant PCBs ( <0.01 ng/g), DDE
(<0.002 ng/g), and NP ( <6 ng/g) in the virgin pellets.
Approximately 12 g of the pellets was placed in stainlesssteel mesh baskets (30 cm diameter and 13 cm height; Figure2), and the baskets were left drifting on the sea surface. Underthese conditions, the pellets were in a single layer and couldfloat freely in the basket in full contact with surface seawater.Eight baskets were placed out at the beginning of theexperiment, and one basket was recovered for analysis eachday. To determine intervariation, three baskets were recov-ered on the last day (day 6) and analyzed. The recovered
pellets were stored in glass bottles at -30°C in the laboratory.
Just before analysis, the pellets were air-dried in the cleanroom for 3 days. Eight grams of the dried pellets was analyzedas described above. Nondeployed virgin pellets were also
FIGURE 1. Sampling locations.
VOL. 35, NO. 2, 2001 / ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY 9319analyzed along with the sample pellets and considered as
day 0 sample.
To evaluate the contribution of adsorption of atmospheric
chemicals to the pellets, the virgin PP resin pellets wereexposed to ambient air during the same period (i.e., 6 days)as their deployment on the sea. The pellets were put in anopen stainless container and placed on the roof of a buildingca. 2 m above the ground near the place of the seawaterdeployment. Before analysis, dust on the pellets was washedout with a small amount of water, and the pellets were air-
dried and analyzed in the same way as the pellets exposed
to the seawater.
When the experiment started, 20 L of seawater were
collected at the deployment site with a stainless steel bucket.The seawater was filtered with prebaked glass fiber filter (293
mm Ø; Whatman GF/F) using a Teflon diaphragm pump
and stainless steel filter holder. The filters containingparticulate matter were freeze-dried and extracted withSoxhlet apparatus with DCM fo r8ha t3 -4 cycles/h. Eight
liters of the filtrates were liquid -liquid extracted with DCM
3 times using a 10-L volume glass separatory funnel. Bothextracts were analyzed for PCBs, DDE, and NP by the samemethod as the extracts from pellets previously mentioned.
Result and Discussion
Analytical Method for Resin Pellets. The results of repeated
extraction indicate that hexane is an appropriate solvent forthe Soxhlet extraction of polypropylene resin pellets. Nosignificant amount ( <1%) of the target compounds (i.e. PCBs,
DDE, and NPs) was detected in the second hexane extractscompared with the first extraction (Table 1). On the otherhand, substantial amounts (12 -80%) of the target com-
pounds were detected in second methanol extracts (Table1). Even in the third methanol extraction, 7 -43% of the
analytes were found, indicating that methanol is insufficientas extraction solvent. The difference in extraction efficiencybetween hexane and methanol is related to the form in whichthe compounds are present on/in the plastic resin pelletsand will be discussed below.
Because the solvent extracts of plastics contain numerous
kinds of organic chemicals, extensive cleanup is necessaryprior to GC determinations. Our two-step-column chroma-tography procedure provided sufficient purification, and nointerference was found on chromatograms of PCBs/DDE and
NP fractions.
Pollutants Contents of Resin Pellets in the Environment.
All the examined marine PP resin pellets contained significantamounts of PCBs, DDE, and NP. The PCBs content (sum of
23 congeners) ranged from 3.97 ng/g to 117 ng/g (Table 2).There have been only a few reports on PCBs content in marine
plastic pellets. PCBs have been detected in polystyrene pelletsfrom northeastern Long Island Sound (8)and polyethylene
pellets from Auckland foreshore (2). The presence of DDE
and NP in marine plastic pellets has not yet been reported.PCBs and DDE concentrations in the PP resin pellets collected
around Tokyo are in the same range as environmental
concentrations found in Tokyo Bay sediments (hundredsng/g for PCBs and several ng/g for DDE ( 28)). NP contents
in the PP resin pellets were 2 orders of magnitude higherthan those found in Tokyo Bay sediment (0.1 -0.6μg/g ( 26)).
Sources of the Pollutants in Plastic Resin Pellets. The
field adsorption experiment results demonstrate that PCBsand DDE adsorb to PP resin pellets from seawater (Figure3). During the experiment, PCBs and DDE in the deployedpellets showed steady concentration increase with time.These increasing trends clearly indicate that ambient sea-
water is the source of PCBs and DDE found in the marine
PP resin pellets and that adsorption to pellet surfaces is themechanism of enrichment. As PP resin pellets are made ofsaturated hydrocarbon units, their surfaces are nonpolar andadsorb hydrophobic pollutants such as PCBs and DDEthrough hydrophobic sorption. It was previously suggestedthat PP granules are similar in polarity to that found in thehydrocarbon solvent and PP is expected to have a verynonpolar surface (19). The results of repeated solvent
extraction (Table 1) are consistent with hydrophobic sorption
of PCBs and DDE on PP pellets. The pollutants were extractedwith n-hexane entirely, whereas they were not extracted
completely with methanol (Table 1). We conclude that thenonpolar surface of PP pellets attracts the hydrophobicpollutants and a polar solvent (i.e. MeOH) is too weak tobreak the hydrophobic interaction. On the other hand,hydrophobic pollutants could be readily partitioned betweenthe nonpolar surface of the pellets and hydrophobic solvent
(i.e. hexane).

320 9ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY / VOL. 35, NO. 2, 2001Sorption of pollutants to pellet surfaces is also supported
by PCBs congener profiles. During the field adsorptionexperiment, seawater (dissolved and particulate phases) andmarine PP resin pellets were also collected and analyzed forPCBs (Figure 4, and Table 3). Due to differential partitioningamong the congeners based on different hydrophobicities,
PCBs in the dissolved phase are enriched in lower chlorinated
congeners, while PCBs adsorbed to the particulate phase areenriched in higher chlorinated congeners (e.g., CB#132, 153,138). The congener profile of PCBs measured in the deployedpellets during the adsorption experiment was rich in highchlorinated congeners and was more correlated to congenerprofiles found in the particulate phase ( r
2)0.96) than to
congener profiles in the dissolved phase ( r2)0.74). This is
consistent with the hypothesis that hydrophobic pollutantsare adsorbed onto plastic pellets through sorption processeswhere more hydrophobic components (i.e. higher chlorinatedcongeners) preferentially partition to nonpolar plastic sur-
faces. Furthermore, the PCB profile found in the deployed
pellet was similar to profile found in the marine PP resinpellets ( r
2)0.94), indicating that the field adsorption
experiment accurately represented the contaminant distri-bution of PP resin pellets in the seawater.
Exposure of PP resin pellets to the atmosphere during
their floating on the sea-surface and stranding on beaches
may facilitate adsorption of atmospheric pollutants onto thepellets. However, no significant PCBs or DDE concentrations
were observed in the PP resin pellets exposed to air duringthe same period as the field adsorption experiment (Figure3). This indicates that adsorption from the atmosphere doesnot directly contribute to enrich the PP resin pellets withPCBs or DDE.
NP contents in the deployed PP resin pellets were not
significant throughout the experiment compared to the blank,and no significant enrichment in NP concentrations wasobserved with time (Figure 3c), although substantial con-centration of NP was observed in the seawater in the canal(Table 3). This suggests other sources of NP than adsorptionfrom seawater. A plausible source is plastic additives appliedin the manufacturing of PP resin pellets. NP were used as
antioxidants in the plastic industry (29). Also, trisnonylphenol
phosphite (TNP), polymer antioxidants, could generate NPby oxidation and subsequent hydrolysis (30). In addition,
NP is contained in the TNP antioxidants (31), because TNP
are synthesized from NP, and unreacted raw material staysin the product. Furthermore, nonylphenol polyethoxylates(NPnEO) are also used as an antistatic agent, and NP isgenerated by degradation of NPnEO (32, 33) . TNP and NPnEO
are currently in use as additives in the Japanese plasticindustries (30, 34) .
The repeated methanol extraction supports the additive-
derived NP hypothesis (Figure 5 and Table 1). PCBs and DDE

VOL. 35, NO. 2, 2001 / ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY 9321extracted in the second methanol extraction were 16% and
12% of the first methanol extractions, respectively. In contrast,the NP released in the second extractions were 80% of theamounts released during the first extractions. Larger amountsof NP in the second extraction imply that additive-derived
NP is incorporated within the matrix of plastic resin pellets,
and they are difficult to leach out with the weak solvent (i.e.,methanol).
However, there still remains a possibility that PP pellets
could adsorb NP which contributes some parts of NP in themarine PP pellets, because NP are widely distributed in urbanenvironments due to the extensive usage of NPEO surfactants
and NP has hydrophobic moiety in the molecule. To evaluatethis possibility, a longer-term experiment is required.
Marine plastic pellets may act as significant source of NP
to marine organisms. It is thought that biomagnification ofNP through the food chain could not be occurring due totheir hydrophilic group and metabolizable nature, although
these conclusions have not been well proved. Ahel et al. (35)
measured NP in macrophytic algae, fish, and wild duck andsuggested that biomagnification of NP did not take place,although its bioaccumulation was observed. This suggeststhat biomagnification may not play an important role totransfer NP, unlike PCBs and DDE, to animals and birds inhigher trophic levels. In these contexts, direct ingestion ofplastic pellets could be a direct and important route of NPto higher animals. Our results indicate that NP is trappeddeep in the pellets, and this may suggest that NP is not easilytransferred to biological tissue when ingested. However,
because the contents of NP are 2 orders of magnitude higher
than PCBs and DDE, even slow or partial transfer of NP tobiological tissue by this route could have serious conse-quences for marine organisms. Furthermore, because sea-birds retain pellets in their ventriculus for several months ormore, and the pellets are worn down in these muscularstructures (16, 36, 37) , the trap of NP in plastic matrix would
not reduce their bioavailability to seabirds.
Adsorption Characteristics of Resin Pellets. For the
marine PP resin pellets collected from the sea surface of
Keihin canal, apparent adsorption coefficients (K’d) of PCBs
and DDE were calculated using their concentrations in thepellets and surrounding water (Table 3). The apparentadsorption coefficients for the pellets were 10
5-106. This
range is similar to that for suspended particles collected fromthe same location at the same time as the PP resin pelletswere collected. Specific surface area of the PP resin pelletswas determined at ∼25 cm
2/g based on the measured
diameter and height of cylindrical pellets. It is 2 orders ofmagnitude lower than those for suspended particles, ∼10
4
cm2/g, which is calculated on the assumption that the
suspended particles are spheres of 1 μm diameter. Large
adsorption coefficients for the PP resin pellets with smallsurface areas indicate that the PP resin pellets have a higheraffinity for hydrophobic pollutants than marine microparticles. This can be attributed to the hydrophobic surfaces.
The high pollutant concentrations in the PP resin particles
may also be due to the marine micro layer. Some hydrophobiccontaminants such as organochlorine pesticides and PCBsare known to be hyperconcentrated in the air-sea interfacemicrolayer (38, 39) . Because the plastic pellets float on sea
surface, they could easily adsorb the contaminants from thecontaminant-enriched microlayer.
Our adsorption experiment indicates that amounts of
PCBs and DDE adsorbed on the PP resin pellets after a 6-daydeployment were 2 orders of magnitude lower than the
pollutants concentrations in marine PP resin pellets (Table
2 and Figure 3). Also, a steady increase in PCBs and DDEconcentrations throughout the field adsorption experimentwas observed. These suggest that the sorption to the PP resinpellets did not reach the equilibrium even after 6 daysdeployment (Figure 3a,b) and would continue for a longerperiod. In some experiments with natural sediments, sorptionequilibrium with PCBs was achieved within 24 or 48 h (40,
41). The slow sorption to PP resin pellets can perhaps be
ascribed to slow diffusion of the pollutants into the polymer
matrix. Diffusion of hydrophobic compounds into PP gran-ules has been reported (19). The larger the sorbent particle,
the slower the overall sorption equilibrium since diffusionpath lengths are longer (42). A larger diameter of PP resin
pellets (1 -5 mm) could account for a longer sorption period
than natural sediments ( ∼several micrometers).

322 9ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY / VOL. 35, NO. 2, 2001Providing the sorption rate for experimental PP resin
pellets is constant and its sorption capacity is as great as thatof the marine PP resin pellets, it could take several years forthe PCBs and DDE concentrations to reach the level observedfor the marine PP resin pellets. Weathering may acceleratethe sorption of pollutants on plastic resin pellets and increasethe adsorption capacity. Weathering increases the surfacearea of pellets, and extension of the size of pores in pelletsmakes the sorbate’s effective diffusivity bigger. On the otherhand, weathering of polymers introduces a variety of oxygen-containing groups. They increase polarity of the polymersurface. Also, weathering of polymers causes rearrangementof the amorphous part and a slight increase in theircrystallinity (43). These factors may decrease the capacity
and rate of the hydrophobic sorption of pollutants by plasticpellets. Long-term (weeks to months) adsorption experiments
should be conducted in future studies.
Spatial Differences. The present study demonstrates the
spatial differences in pollutant concentrations and composi-tions in PP resin pellets (Table 2). PCBs and DDE content ofPP resin pellets from Kasai Seaside Park, Keihin Canal, andKugenuma Beach were 1 order of magnitude higher thanthat from Shioda Beach. Because the source of PCBs andDDE is thought to be ambient seawater, the differences in
pollutant concentrations in marine pellets could reflect the
degree of pollution in surrounding environments. The formersites are more urbanized and industrialized than Shiodabeach. The Japanese Environmental Protection Agency moni-tored PCBs and DDE of sea basses, Lateolabrax japonicus ,
in Japanese coastal water (44). Off San-in coast including
Shioda Beach (Figure 1), PCBs concentration was 0.04 μg/
g-wet ( n)5), and DDE concentration was 0.006 μg/g-wet
(n)5) in the fish. On the other hand, in Tokyo Bay (Figure
1, close to the three urban sites), PCBs concentration in seabasses was 0.26 μg/g-wet ( n)5), and DDE concentration
was 0.018 μg/g-wet ( n)5) on average, which are much higher
than those from San-in coast. The observed correlationbetween contaminant levels in the PP resin pellets and inbiota suggests that plastic resin pellets could be a goodindicator of the pollution level in the environments.
PCB congener distributions also varied among sampling
sites (Figure 4a,e,f,g) and not so correlated ( r
2)0.41-0.89).
PCBs in PP resin pellets from the sites in/near Tokyo Baywere more depleted in higher-chlorinated congeners thanthe site in the Sea of Japan (i.e., Shioda Beach) (Figure 4).These differences can be attributed to a variety of localcontamination sources with different PCB profiles.
The observed spatial differences in pollutant concen-
trations and their possible correlation with the pollutionlevel in surrounding environments suggest the potential useof plastic pellets as a tool for monitoring of organic micro-pollutants in seawater. However, the pollutant content andcongener profile of marine pellets may also reflect theirhistory of exposure to contamination. If pellets are trans-
ported over a long distance, the pollutant content in the
pellets reflects not only local pollution in the area wherethey are collected but also pollution along the entire transportpath since their discharge. Detection of specific contaminantsunique to a certain area may indicate the source or pathwayof pellets. The detailed analysis of contaminants in the pelletsmay provide information about both their source and theoceanographic processes controlling their dispersion andtransport in coastal waters.
The present study demonstrates elevated concentrations
of pollutants on/in marine PP resin pellets. The resin pellets,therefore, play a role as pollutant transport media in marineenvironments. Two types of sources of the pollutants areindicated. One is adsorption of hydrophobic pollutants fromseawater. PCBs and DDE were found to accumulate in plasticpellets in concentrations up to 10
5-106times higher thansurrounding seawater. Another source of pollutants is plastic
additives and related chemicals (e.g. degradation products).Although the present study focuses on nonylphenol, someother chemicals used as additives could also be detected inmarine pellets. Plastic resin pellets have been also found inthe stomachs of marine birds (9-16). The uptake of pellet-
sorbed contaminants to their tissues is a concern. The present
study indicates plastic resin pellets act as a pollutant
accumulator that could transfer hydrophobic pollutants toorganisms. Further studies must be done on the transfer ofthe chemicals from pellets to biological tissue while theytransit through the digestive system of birds and otheranimals.
