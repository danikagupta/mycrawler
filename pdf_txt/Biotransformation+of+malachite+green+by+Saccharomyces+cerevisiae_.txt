Abstract  
Saccharomyces cerevis iae (baker’s yeast) is the most important industrial microorganisms. This 
yeast is commonly used  as a leavening agent in baking bread and bakery products, where it pr o-
duces carbon dioxide fro m converting of the fermentable  sugars present in the dough. Nowadays, 
industrial and chemical activities led to produce new compounds with new kinds of contamination 
in the environment. Discharge of untreated or partially treated industrial sewage has created the 
contamination problems of rivers and lakes such as drugs,  oil, heavy metals , paints,  pesticides and 
various chemical compounds in them. Hence, it is necessary to control and reduce the levels of 
these compounds in wastewater  and bring them to permissible values.  This study aims to study 
the bioconversion potential of commonly available Saccharomyces cerevisiae  for the two textile 
dyes of Carmoisine and Reactive Black 5. Reaction mixtures for biotransformation of dyes i n-
cluded 50 mg/l Carmoisine or 25 mg/l Reactive Black 5  and 1%  dried harvested cells of S. cerev i-
siae  (bread’ s yeast) were tested. Harvested dry and wet yeast were studied for this purpose. The 
results show that  harvested cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae  are able to bioconvert  Carmoisine 
and Reactive Black 5. Reactive Black 5, Carmoisine are deg raded by biotransformation 85% and 
53% within 24 hours in water at the room temperature .

 860  1. Introduction  
Large numbers of synthetic dyes are used for various industrial applications and significant proportion appears 
in the form of wastewater and is spilled into the environment. These contaminated effluents  which mainly are  
from dyeing and also finishing processes and are associated with the water pollution. Wastewater res ulting from  
these shows  improper impacts in terms of Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), Chemical Oxygen Demand 
(COD), Total Organic Carbon  (TOC), suspended solids,  color, affect on pH and the organic compounds, [1]-[3]. 
Azo dyes may be classified as toxic and carcinogenic  [4]. Synthetic dyes cannot be efficiently decolorized by 
traditional  biological processes [5]. Thus, a number of biological and chemical methods have been developed for 
the efficient  removal of industrial azo dyes [6] [7]. 
Azo dyes are electron -deficient xenobiotic components because  of their azo linkage, and also other electron - 
withdrawing groups, which generate  an electron deficiency and make the dye less susceptible to biodegradation 
[8] [9]. However under the appropriate  conditions, they can be degraded by reductases [10]- [12].  Azoreductases 
work only in the presence  of reducing equivalents, e.g., FADH, NADH and NADPH [13]  [14]. The available 
evidence  indicates that azoreductase activity can be associated  with more than one reductase [15].  Azoreducta s-
es are present in microorganisms, such as bacteria [16]-[18], algae [19] and yeast [20].  
The use of microorganisms for the biodegradation of dyes is an attractive alternative to the development of 
bioremediation  processes for the treatment of textile wastewater. Biological methods are environmentally 
friendly, produce less sludge than  physical and chemical systems, and are relatively inexpensive, as the running 
cost is low. Microbial discoloration can occur via  biosorption, enzymatic degradation or a combination of both 
[21]. 
Yeast has long been known to be capable of bioaccumulation  of heavy metal from solution and recently some 
reports for accumulation of dyes  [22]-[30]. But little work has been carried out investigating the ability of yeast 
to act a biocatalyst for textile dyes especially using h arvested cells.  
This study aims to study the bioconversion potential of commonly available Saccharomyces cerevisiae  yeast 
for the two textile dyes of Carmoisine and Reactive Black 5  at batch -scale level.  
2. Materials and Methods  
2.1. Chemicals  
All chemicals used in the experiments were reagent grade. All solutions were prepared with distilled water. 
Carmoisine  and Reactive Black  5 were obtained from a local company (Alvan Sabet,  Tehran, Iran) . 
2.2. Microorganism  
Harvested cells of S. cerevisiae or ba ker’s yeast were locally purchased from Razavi Yeast Company, Mashhad, 
Iran.  
In this experiment, yeast was prepared at a concentration of 1%. For this purpose, 1 g of yeast was suspended 
in 100 ml of toxic substance solution.  
2.3. Preparation of Reaction  Mixtures  
200 ml reaction mixtures were prepared by mixture of dye Carmoisine (50 mg/l) or Reactive Black (25  mg/l) 
and 2 grams Harvested cells of S. cerevisiae. The experiments were performed  at room temperature (28 ˚C ± 
2˚C). 
2.4. Analytical Methods  
Five milliliters of sample was taken from each beaker  at definite time intervals. Samples were centrifuged to  
remove suspended biomass and the concentration of dye  in the supernatant was determined by reading absor-
bance  at 590 nm for Reactive Black 5 and 515 nm  for Carmoisine. Absorbance  measurements were carried out 
by using a PG Instruments, T80+UV/VIS model spectrometer.  
3. Results  
Harvested cells of S. cerevisiae were investigated in the reaction mixtures to study the ability for biotransform a-A. Sadeghi  et al .

asthe units of percentage of biotransformation in Table 1 . Figure 1  and Figure  2 show t he decolorization of 
Carmoisine by  S. cerevisiae.  Figure 3 shows the decolorization of Reactive Black  5 (25  mg/l) and Figure 4 
show s biotransformation of Carmoisine (50 mg/l) using different concentration of S. cerevisiae.  
Initially different concentrations of cells (0.05% to 2.5%) were studied and it was found that by increasing the 
cell mass, more biotransformation happened. For main experiments the concentration of 1% was used.  Decrease 
in the absorption indic ates that decolourization of this dye occurred by degradation. Reactive Black 5 and  Car-
moisine are degraded by biotransformation 85% and 53% within 24 hours in water at the room temperature.  
S. cerevisiae is capable of utilizing a variety of carbon and nitrogen sources. In the absence of natural carbon 
and nitrogen sources the yeast is able to use some other synthetic chemicals. In this investigation, an experiment 
protocol was designed and used to check t he ability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to utilize two textile dyes of

4. Discussion 
Although some reports have mentione d that S. cerevisiae  in cultures is  able to accumulate some dyes in several 
days. Biotransformation of these dyes in this study proves that the harvested cells of the S. cerevisiae can be  
promising for further research and practical usage in the field of dye biotransformation for example in chemi cal, 
biological sciences and industries . As well hold promise in providing a low  cost and efficient means to  treat the 
textile effluent.
