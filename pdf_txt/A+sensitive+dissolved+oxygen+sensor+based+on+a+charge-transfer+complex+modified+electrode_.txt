Abstract:  A charge-transfer comple x was modified on the gr aphite paste electrode for making a sensitive 
dissolved oxygen sensor. It was composed of copper with two ligands of phenanthroline and 
1,2-dicyano-1,2-dithiol- ethane . Because of the low redox po tential of the core ion and the pull and repulsive effect 
from the ligands, the redox of modified complex toke pl ace under lower potential and it could selectively catalyze 
the reduction of dissolved oxygen. The slope of the chronocoulometric curve of the sensor proportionally 
responded on the content of dissolved oxy gen from 0 to 16 mg/L within 1–2 se conds. It was app lied to detect the 
dissolved oxygen in  tape water and the campus river for 3.0mg/L and 5.1mg/L. This sens or responded the 
dissolved oxygen with high selectivity, wi de linear range, hi gh accuracy, excellent  stability and fast speed. It’s very 
possible to act as a practical sensor for the detection of dissolved oxygen in field.

 484 1. Introduction 
The dissolved oxygen (DO) is a comprehensive qualit y index of environmental water. Its level and the 
variation can reflect the conten t of oxygen consuming pollutants and the self-depuratin g ability of the surface water 
[1]. The Winkler titration [2 ] and the Clark oxygen electr ode [3] are the typical methods for determining the DO. 
The studies to develop the more sensitive,  precise and rapid resp onding DO sensors are me aningful for applying 
on-line or in field. The chemical modi fication [4] is an effective approach to improve the characters of electrode 
mainly to enhance the sensitivity and se lectivity. This paper will  report a copper complex modified electrode that 
sensitively catalized the re dox of DO. The complex composed of thre e components with co pper as the core 
element and two ligands of phenanthroline and 1,2-dicyan o-1,2-dithiol- ethane. Due to the pull and repulsive effect 
for electrons from the ligands, the complex have the property of charge transfer [5, 6]. Its reversible redox reaction 
carried out under lower potential and there would be a parallel catalyzing fro m dissolved oxygen. This modified 
electrode could be applied as a DO sens or because of its rapid response of slope of ch ronocoulometry in linear 
range of dissolved oxygen from 0 to 16 mg/L.  
2. Experimental 
2.1 Instruments and Chemicals 
A BAS-100A Electrochemical Analyzer (Bioanalytical  System InC., USA) was applied to control the 
three-electrode cell with a Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a Pt wire auxiliary electrode in all of electrochemical 
studies. 
The complex of copper-phenanthrolin e-1,2-dicyano-1,2 -dithiol-ethane was synthesized in lab. The spectral 
pure graphite powder of 70 µm of diameter was used to construct the ca rbon paste electrode for applying as the 
base electrode of the sensor. 
Other chemicals included epoxy resin, relevant solidifier and DMF were used. 
 2.2 The fabrication of the sensor 
The DMF solution of comp lex was blended into the graphite powder. When th e solvent was volatilized, 
churned up them with the epoxy resin and solidifier . Then filled the pa ste into a glass tu be with a copper 
conducting wire. Polished and cleaned the surface thoroughly when the paste was dried absolutely.   Sensors & Transducers Magazine (S&T e- Digest), Vol.64, Issue 2, February 2006 , pp.483-489  
 485 2.3 Characterizing properties of the sensor 
The cyclic voltammetry, bulk electro lysis and chronocoulometry were ap plied to study the electrochemical 
properties, the electrochemical reaction mechanism and the analytical merits of the sensor.  
3. Results and Discussion 
3.1 The electrochemical properties of the sensor 
On the cyclic voltammetric curve of th e sensor, there is a couple of redo x peak around the potential of 0V . 
Under the slow scan rate of 2mV/s,  the reduction peak obviously exhib ited double steps of mono-electron 
reduction (Fig. 1) that were  measured by semi-logarithm analysis and co ulometric electrolysis. By the results of 
that the peak currents were proportional to the scan rate and the i-t curve didn’t obey the Cottrel equa tion, the peak 
potentials were proportional  to the natural logarithm of  the scan rate, it was prov ed that the electrochemical 
reaction of the sensor was typically  an adsorbing controlled process [7]. The electrochemical reaction could be 
expressed as follow equations: 
 
Cu(II) L 1L2 + e → Cu(I) L 1L2 + e → Cu + L 1(adsorbed) + L 2(adsorbed) 
Cu - 2e + L 1(adsorbed) + L 2(adsorbed) → Cu(II) L 1L2

 3.2 The catalytic effect from the DO If there were oxygen molecules in the solution, the reduc tion current of first step re markably increased meanwhile 
there couldn’t observe the seco nd step reduction peak and the oxidation pe ak anymore. It revealed that there must

 486 be a parallel catalytic reaction [8, 9] occurred to catal yze the first step of the reduction of the complex: 
 Cu(II) L
1L2 + e → Cu(I) L 1L2 
 Cu(I) L
1L2 + O 2 → Cu(II) L 1L2 
 The table 1 showed the difference of the response upon th e DO between the sensor and the bare graphite 
paste electrode.

3.3 The analytical characteristics of the sensor 
The sensor could be applied to detect  the DO with the method of chronocoulometry [10]  at the potential of 
–0.3V , the slope of the i-Q curve was proportional to the content of DO: 
Slope = 2nAF(D/ Π)1/2CDO = KC DO 
It is an excellent basis to build up the rapid respon se of the sensor in 1–2 seconds due to that the 
chronocoulometry is speedy. The slope was determined by the diffusion of oxygen and the det ection was carried 
out in quiescent state. It ha ppened in 1-2 seconds therefor e didn’t destroy the equilibrium  of the oxygen.  Within the 
range of the content of disso lved oxygen from 0 to 16 mg /L that was calibrated by tit ration, there was a regression 
equation of S = −0.19 + 0.157DO with the re gression coefficient of  0.998 (Fig. 2). The sensor has the excellent 
reproducibility of RSD of 1.8%  (n=20) and the good stability due to that the complex was very difficult to dissolve 
into water. The cyclic voltammetric curv e of the sensor afte r months use wa s absolutely same as its original curve. 
The measures of polish and wash could recover the properties of the sensor if it was polluted.

3.4 The influence facts to the sensor 
The acidity and the temperature of the solution influenced  the response of sens or. The slope increased 
obviously due to the catalyzing  in whole range of the pH especially in th e range from 7.0 to 9.0 , it could be see in

3.5 The application of the sensor 
The sensor was applied to detect the dissolved oxyge n in tape water and our cam pus river for 3.0mg/L and 
5.1mg/L. 
  
4. Conclusion 
This sensor responded the dissolved oxygen with high selectivity, wide linear range, high accuracy, good 
stability and fast speed. Due to  it was structured u pon the charge transfer complex of copper, it could work at 
potential of –0.3V that was lower than Clark oxygen electrode for 0.5V . It had provided an extra advantage for 
improving the selectivity side  by side with the intrinsi c selectivity of co mplex. So the sensor has better 
anti-jamming ability than Clark oxygen electrode. The ra pid period of chronocoulometri c detection in 1-2 seconds 
that didn’t destroy the equilibr ium of the oxygen and the higher analytical  merit of sensor resulted in the high 
sensitivity and accuracy of determination. Furt hermore, the determination could be carried on in origin water 
samples needn’t to add an y reagent. It’s very possible to develop a practical sensor for the detection of dissolved 
oxygen on-line or in field.
