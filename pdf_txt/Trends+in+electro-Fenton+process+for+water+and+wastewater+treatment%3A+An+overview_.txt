I. INTRODUCTION  
In recent year large amount of water and wastewater generated from various industries like tannery, pulp and paper industr y, 
dairy industry, steel industry, tyre and tube manufacturing industries etc., Nowadays more organic contaminants from agricult ural 
runoff, soil contaminants, landfill leachates, industrial wastewater etc., this organic compounds in water poses serious pr oblems to 
public health as well as environment. All over the world the present challenging problem facing is water quality and availabi lity of 
water ( 1). Various treatment methods are discovered to focus on waste minimization and water conservation in the recent years, in 
that Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) is one among them. AOPs refer to the chemical process which follow oxidation and 
helps to degrade biologically toxic and non degradable chemicals.  
II. FENTON PROCESS  
In AOPs, oxidation using Fenton’s r eagent is one of the best effective, alternative, powerful and environmental friendly 
technique, this method is used for the degradation of a large number of hazardous and organic pollutants. fenton reagent firs t 
named as fenton chemistry, fenton chemistry  is the oxidation of organic substrate by Iron (II) and hydrogen peroxide. It was first 
described by Henry John Horstman Fenton in 1890. The first fenton process reported by Fenton was Maleic acid oxidation. 
Oxidation, Neutralization, Flocculation and sedi mentation are the main steps involved in the Fenton process. The degradation 
mechanism of organic pollutants by Fenton reaction is  given in eqs 1 to 4  
Fe2+ + H 2O2 → Fe3+ + OH- + HO.       (1) 
RH + HO. → R. + H 2O        (2)

R. + Fe2+ → R+ + Fe2+        (3) 
Fe2+ + HO.→ Fe3+ + OH-        (4) 
The Fenton process has some of the disadvantages in the treatment process because it require high concentration Fe2+ and 
large amount of Fe sludge is formed so that wastewater treatme nt is expensive and it needs large amount chemicals and 
manpower. Fenton’s reaction is only limited for narrow pH because iron ions will be precipitated at higher pH values and stor ing 
and transport of H 2O2 are difficult.  To overcome  this above problem, Electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) 
based on Fenton’s reaction ( 1).  
III. ELECTRO FENTON PROCESS  
EAOPs are eco – friendly methods and recent days it received more attention for water remediation. Electro – Fenton is 
the most popular process in EAOPs ( 2). , Electro – Fenton process is a promising technology for wastewater treatment process and 
its more economical, efficient, and environmental friendly for treatment and removal of organic matter compared to convention al 
technologies ( 3). This tech nology based on the continuous electro generation of H2O2  at a suitable cathode by the reduction of 
dissolved oxygen  or air along with the addition of an iron catalyst to the treated solution to produce oxidant .OH at the bulk via 
Fenton’s reaction.  
O2 + 2H+ + 2e- → H 2O2         (5) 
Fe2+ + H 2O2 → Fe3+ + OH- + HO.        (6) 
Fe3+ + e-→ Fe2+          (7) 
Electro – Fenton process solves some problems generated from conventional Fenton  process, for example degradation of organic 
pollutants increase because of  the continuous regeneration of Fe2+  at the cathode and H 2O2 is produce at onsite so that it avoids 
storage and transport problems ( 1).  
The typical mechanism of the electro Fenton process illustrated in the below figure 1. Electro Fenton Process includes  both 
electrochemical and Fenton treatment methods and each method are powerful and effective method for the treatment process.

Compare to conventional Fenton’s Reagent or other treatment technology the more attention has been paid to Electro 
Fenton Process (EFP) for various wastewater treatment ( 4). Compare to conventional Fento n’s reagent EFP is effective, 
environmental friendly, easy to treat, react well with organics and it doesnot produce secondary pollutants and toxic compoun ds 
during oxidation but it is also have some disadvantages like EFP should be maintained in acidic co nditions, H 2O2   presence may 
harmful to micro – organisms, during Fenton process large amount of small flocs were observed that flocs take more or large time 
to settle, H 2O2 concentration higher than 1000 mg/l that effects on the biodegradability of the w astewater because of some residual 
H2O2

In recent days the application of Electro – Fenton process is focused more on the remediation of water and wastewater 
contaminated by several organic pollutants such as dyes, pesticides and herbicides, p henolic compounds, leachates, drugs etc 
(2)(3) the applicability of Electro – Fenton process for decolourization, removal of odour ingredients with good energy efficiency, 
EFP is applied for destruction of toxic waste and non – biodegradable effluents and it is more suitable for secondary biological 
treatment. Some application of electro – Fenton’s process and research highlights as shown in the below table 1.

V.  AFFECTING FACTORS  
pH 
pH played a very important role in EF process and it is a significant impact in EF process because it control the variation 
of iron and hydroxyl radical generated. In lower pH electro Fenton process occurs more so that all experiments carried in the 
acidic range. The reaction gets slow down because of complex species of Iron and it is slowly reacts with peroxide compared t o 
[Fe(OH)(H 2O5)2+. In lower pH, the EF process may occur more efficient and the pH solution decreases the conductivity increases 
(6).   In pH range 3 – 4 the maximum amount of waste removal has been observed. The pH solution below 2, the waste 
degradation has been reduced because of the generation of [Fe(H 2O)6]2+ and [H 3O2]2+ and the pH solution above 4 the insignificant 
amount of waste degradation occur due the formation of hydroxyl radical ( 7). The maximum removal efficiency occurs  in pH 
range 3 and the pH value increases with the increase in the reaction time  (4). At pH range 3 the reaction time is inversely 
proportional to the electrical power used ( 8). A low pH is more favorable for the production of hydrogen per -oxide so that the 
conversion of DO to   hydrogen peroxide consumes protons in acidic solution ( 9). At pH value is high the iron precipitates and it 
reducing the concentration of the dissolved iron ( 11). The pH value increases, the iron ions precipitates.  If pH is less than 2, H 2O2 
cannot be discomposed to OH. by Fe2+ (5). According to all research i t has been confirmed that the optimum pH of Fenton process 
is around 3 (2). The redox system and decolourization gives more stable results when pH is less than 3.5, Ferric ions are eas ily 
formed because of ferrous ions and it is propensity to produce ferri c hydroxo complex and H 2O2 is unstable and it is easily 
decomposes itself in basic solutions.  M Pushpalatha, M B Krishna , International Journal of Advance Research, Ideas and Innovations in Technology.

Table 2, it was found that the optimum p H for EF process varies from 2 to 4.

 Temperature  
 Temperature plays a significant role in the electro Fenton process. The temperature is negatively affected the removal 
efficiency. The removal efficiency decreases when temperature increases. The concentration of H 2O2 decreases, the temperature 
increases because of the reduction in the DO concentration. Rat e of self decomposition of H 2O2 to water and oxygen increases 
with temperature. The decomposition rate doubles when temperature rises to 10° C. The negative impact on the process efficien cy 
when temperature is too low and too high. The optimum range of tem perature between 20 and 30° C because of relatively higher 
treatment efficiency ( 9)(12). The optimum temperature and corresponding removal efficiencies reported by various studies are 
given in table 3

Applied Current Dens ity 
 Current density plays a very important role in EF process. Energy consumption increases with increasing the current 
density. The current density increases the removal efficiency also increases ( 6). The production rate of hydrogen peroxide on the 
catho de increases when the current density increases. The removal efficiency increases with the current density ( 9). The applied 
current is directly related to the cost of EF process. The degradation of substrate increases in the beginning because of the  increa se 
in current density. In electro Fenton process the current density is always low. In EP process large reaction rate occurs bec ause of 
the higher current density. According to some research works the current density in the EF process should less than 10 A /m2 (5). 
The optimum applied current and the corresponding removal efficiency of EF process from various studies as shown in table 4

 Fe2+ Concentration  
 Fe2+ Concentration is an important affec ting factor in the EF process. If Fe2+ Concentration increasing, the hydroxyl 
radical generated via Fenton’s reaction. Fe2+ Concentration increases, the removal rate declined. Fe2+ Concentration is higher than 
0.2mM, the percentage of hydroxyl radicals fro m Fe2+ ions increased ( 1). The EF processes can operate in optimum conditions 
with small initial concentration of catalytic Fe2+. TOC removal efficiency increasing, the Fe2+ Concentration also increases ( 13). 
The degradation rate decreases by increasing th e Fe2+ Concentration. The Fe2+ Concentration effects on the kinetic rate also. Initial 
Fe2+ Concentration is beneficial for the Fe3+ - H2O2 complexes ( 11) (14). If Fe2+ Concentration is more than 500 mg/l, OH radicals 
are scavenged through the reactions  
Fe2+ + OH → Fe3+ + OH- 
The Fe2+ Concentration is higher, the OH radicals amount availability to oxidize organic matter become low and Fe2+ 
Concentration increases the COD values decreases. The optimum Fe2+ Concentration and Removal efficiencies from EF proce ss 
as shown in table 5

 H2O2 Concentration  
 H2O2 Concentration is one of the most important factors in EF process and plays a major role for COD removal 
efficiency in EF processes. H 2O2 Concentration dosage increases, the hydroxyl radicals are also increased. H 2O2 Concentration 
dosage increases, the COD removal rate also increases ( 6). The removal efficiency of TOC increases with increasing the H 2O2 
Concentration. The lower the concentrati on of H 2O2 does not influence the rate of removal of TOC ( 13). The removal efficiency 
of pollutants increases due to increase in the hydroxyl radical’s concentration as a result of addition of H 2O2. H 2O2 Concentration 
dosage is high in the removal efficien cy because of hydroxyl radicals scavenging effect of H 2O2 Concentration and the 
recombination of the hydroxyl radical ( 14). EF process increases with increasing the H 2O2 Concentration, the removal efficiency 
of chromium is also further improve the quality and H 2O2 Concentration presence helps to faster production of Fe3+ (4). 
Distance between the electrodes  
 The distances decreases between the electrodes cause to decrease of the ohmic drop through the electrolyte and then an 
equivalent decreases the elec trical conductivity and voltage. Closes the electrodes gives the better performances. To avoid the 
short circuits between anode and cathode, the electrodes should keep approximate distance ( 5). The electrode distance between 1.3 
and 2.1 cm, the COD removal  efficiency from landfill leachate remains same and the removal efficiency of EF process system is 
less when the electrode distance is shorter and larger (2).

CONCLUSIONS  
During rapid industrialization, the large amount of wastewater generated and contaminated. The recent advances have 
investigated the different methods for wastewater treatment. In that advanced oxidation process is ad vanced method for the 
wastewater treatment, among the different AOPs several research ers have demonstrated that EFp is a promising method and it is 
more economical, efficient, environmental friendly to remove organic matters. This review paper also conclud ed that EFP is good 
for removal of COD, TOC, Color and it is alternative method for treatment of wastewater containing synthetic dyes due to this  
efficient and low operating cost and environmental friendly method
