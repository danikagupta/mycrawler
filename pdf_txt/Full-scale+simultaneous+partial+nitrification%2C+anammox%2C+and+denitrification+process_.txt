ABSTRACT
A full-scale swine-wastewater activated sludge treatment plant that contains naturally enriched
anammox bio ﬁlms was investigated for 2 years. Red bio ﬁlm in this system included Planctomycetes
at a maximum of 62.5% of the total bacteria diversity, including Candidatus Jettenia and Candidatus
Brocadia. The plant was operated with an in ﬂuent containing 1,104 ±513 mg/L biochemical oxygen
demand (BOD) and 629 ±198 mg/L total nitrogen (TN) (BOD/N of 1.78 ±0.58) at a volumetric BOD
loading rate of 0.32 ±0.12 kg/m3/d. Notwithstanding drastically varying in ﬂuent concentrations, BOD
removal ef ﬁciency was stable at 95 ±4%. However, TN removal ﬂuctuated at 75 ±14%. Dissolved
oxygen (DO) concentrations in the aeration tank were 0.06 –2.0 mg/L. DO concentration greatly
affected nitrogen removal, e.g. when DO was lower than 0.3 mg/L, total inorganic nitrogen removalwas 61 ±14% (/C2020
/C14C), 78±16% (20 –30/C14C), and 75 ±12% (/C2130/C14C), whereas at higher DO
concentrations, removal rates were 47 ±13%, 55 ±16%, and 68%, respectively. As BOD
concentration in the in ﬂuent was limited compared to nitrogen concentration, nitrogen was likely
removed by simultaneous nitri ﬁcation, anammox, and denitri ﬁcation (SNAD) under microaerobic
conditions. Maintaining low DO concentrations would therefore be a simple method to improvenitrogen removal during SNAD processes for swine-wastewater treatment with ﬂuctuating in ﬂuent.Chikako Ishimoto

INTRODUCTION
Livestock waste is a major cause of nitrogen pollution in
public water bodies globally ( Steinfeld et al. ). In
Japan, livestock waste generates 700,000 t of nitrogen per
year, exceeding that generated by chemical fertilisers
(400,000 t per year). Livestock waste therefore contributessigniﬁcantly to nitrogen contamination in rivers, lakes, and
groundwater. Japanese law stipulates the upper limit of
nitrogen concentration in puri ﬁed wastewater discharged
to public water bodies from livestock farms. The most gen-eral discharge standard for livestock farms in July 2019
was 500 mg N/L (NO
2–-NþNO 3–-Nþ0.4×NH 4þ-N). This
value has been reduced in line with the discharge standardcurrently applied to other activities (100 mg/L). Therefore,
improved nitrogen removal at wastewater treatment facili-ties on livestock farms is essential.
Swine farms commonly have wastewater treatment
facilities because swine, unlike cattle and poultry, excretemore urine than faeces, which generates large amounts ofwastewater. Wastewater treatment with activated sludge is
an important method for treating swine wastewater, and
the ef ﬂuent is discharged to public water bodies. Pre-treated
swine wastewater arriving as the in ﬂuent for activated
sludge treatment contains 3,500 ±2,100 mg/L biochemical
oxygen demand (BOD) and 1,300 ±650 mg/L total nitrogen
(TN) ( Waki et al. ). Since a signi ﬁcant part of the
treatment process aims to remove BOD but not nitrogen,
treated ef ﬂuents can contain TN concentrations as high as
430±540 mg/L, even with BOD concentrations as low as
59±83 mg BOD/L.This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative

Conventionally, nitrogen is removed biologically during
wastewater treatment. The general nitrogen removal process
involves nitri ﬁcation followed by denitri ﬁcation. The
nitriﬁcation process oxidises ammonium to nitrite or nitrate
by autotrophic ammonium-oxidising bacteria or nitrite-
oxidising bacteria, after which nitrite or nitrate areconverted to nitrogen gas by heterotrophic denitri ﬁers
during denitri ﬁcation. A relatively new process of nitrogen
removal, namely anammox, was discovered in the 1990s.
Anammox is an autotrophic nitrogen removal process thatproduces nitrogen gas from nitrite and ammonium without
the need for organic carbon sources (Equation (1)) ( Strous
et al. ). It has been proposed as a promising way of
saving the aeration-energy cost of nitri ﬁcation and the
chemical cost of denitri ﬁcation.

More than 100 full-scale anammox plants are currently
in operation globally ( Lackner et al. ). These plants
are used to treat various nitrogen-rich wastewaters, suchas reject water at municipal wastewater treatment plants,
landﬁll leachates, and wastewater from industrial plants,
including food processing and semiconductor production.Side-stream treatment of municipal wastewater was carried
out by 75% of the full-scale anammox plants.
The application of anammox to swine wastewater or
its anaerobic digestor liquor has been tested with labora-tory-scale reactors in several studies. Generally, anammox
treatment can be divided into two systems: one is a two-
stage con ﬁguration combining a nitrite-production (partial
nitritation) reactor followed by an anammox reactor, and
the second is a single-stage con ﬁguration including both
partial nitri ﬁcation and anammox. Two-stage anammox sys-
tems for swine wastewater or its anaerobic digestor liquor
have been studied using up- ﬂow anaerobic sludge bed reac-
tors, up- ﬂowﬁxed bed reactors, or continuously stirred
granular anammox reactors ( Ahn et al. ;Hwang et al.
;Yamamoto et al. ;Qiao et al. ). Single-stage
anammox systems have been studied using sequencingbatch or sequencing batch bio ﬁlm reactors ( Zhang et al.
b;Daverey et al. ). These experiments in anammox
treatment for swine wastewater were performed with labora-
tory-scale reactors at controlled temperatures of 30 –35
/C14C,
with only one exception ( Daverey et al. ).Daverey
et al. ()operated a 5 L sequencing batch reactor to
treat anaerobic digestate of swine wastewater containing519 mgN/L, 288 mg/L, and 387 mg/L ammonium, BOD,
and chemical oxygen demand (COD), respectively, at ambi-
ent temperature. The TN removal rate was 0.123 kg/m3/d in
a steady state. Nitrogen removal was carried out by simul-
taneous nitri ﬁcation, anammox, and denitri ﬁcation (SNAD)
(Chen et al. ). Since actual swine wastewater contains
high concentrations of both BOD and nitrogen, SNAD is areasonable choice for its treatment. However, full-scale
SNAD plant operation on a working farm under ambient
temperature conditions has not been studied to date.
Anammox was unintentionally enriched in bio ﬁlm at
full-scale swine-wastewater activated sludge plants on
three farms in Japan ( Suto et al. ). The concentration
of anammox in the bio ﬁlm was almost as high as that of ana-
mmox in arti ﬁcial wastewater, with a maximum activity of
295μmol N
2/g ignition loss (IL)/h and maximum anammox
DNA copy numbers of 1.35 ×1012copies/g IL. The
inﬂuent at these fac ilities had high concentrations of organic
carbon and nitrogen, with BOD and ammonium
concentrations of 400 –4,645 mg/L and 465 –4,931 mg/L,
respectively, and a BOD/N ratio of 0.23 –2.76. This suggests
that the conditions at these facilities are ideal for nitrogen
removal by SNAD, i.e. full-scale SNAD plants on swine farms.
The purpose of this study was to clarify the key factors in
nitrogen removal performance at a full-scale SNAD swine-
wastewater treatment plant. A full-scale SNAD plant on aswine farm was investigated for 2 years, and the effects of
environmental and operational conditions on nitrogen
removal were analysed. The long-term operation of such awastewater treatment plant is reported here for the ﬁrst time.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Description of full-scale swine-wastewater treatment
plant
The activated sludge treatment facility in this study was con-
structed in 1989 to treat swine wastewater at the Swine andPoultry Research Center, Shizuoka Prefectural Research Insti-
tute of Animal Industry, Japan. It currently treats wastewater
produced by about 900 head of fattening swine. A schematicdiagram of the treatment plant is shown in SupplementaryFigure 1. The main aeration tank ( ﬁrst aeration tank) was
operated with a hydraulic retention time of 80 hours and
mixed liquor suspended solids of 10,900 ±2,000 mg/L (aver-
age±s.d.). In ﬂuents were continuously fed into the tanks,
which were continuously aerated. Most nitrogen removal
occurred in the ﬁrst aeration tank, and not much removal457 C. Ishimoto et al. |Full-scale SNAD process for swine-wastewater treatment Water Science & Technology |81.3|2020

on 17 September 2021took place in the second. Therefore, analyses focused on the
ﬁrst aeration tank. Wastewater characteristics were measured
for 2 years, from April 2016 to March 2018.
Analytical methods
BOD, suspended solids (SS), and IL were determined fol-
lowing the Japan Sewage Works Association ( ). BOD
was determined after an incubation period of 5 days, and
the ef ﬂuent was measured as carbonaceous BOD. Because
the number of BOD data measurements was small, if the
dates on which BOD and other data were measured were
not the same, a gap within 5 days was taken as being thesame day for analysis. The volatile suspended solids (VSS)
were determined for liquid samples after washing the pre-
cipitates from the wastewater twice by centrifuging at1,500 g, decanting and resuspending in deionised water,
and then drying the precipitates at 105
/C14C and 600/C14C. IL
was determined for bio ﬁlm samples after drying the solids
at 105/C14C and 600/C14C. COD and TN were determined via
the closed re ﬂux colorimetric and persulfate digestion
methods, respectively, using a DR 2400 spectrophotometer
(Hach Co., Loveland, CO, USA).
Total ammonium was determined using ion chromato-
graphy (ICS-1100 Dionex, California, USA), as were total
nitrite and nitrate (IC20, Dionex). The pH and electric con-ductivity were measured using a glass electrode (HI98310,
Hanna Instruments, Rhode Island, USA). Dissolved oxygen
(DO) was measured using a luminescent DO probe(HQ40d and LDO 10105, Hach Co.). Free ammonia (FA)and free nitric acid (FNA) concentrations were calculated
through equilibrium as described by Anthonisen et al.
(Anthonisen et al. ).
Anammox activity measurement was conducted using
ﬂoating granules (collected in March 2014 and January
2019) by the tracer method ( Yoshinaga et al. ). Samples
were anaerobically incubated in triplicate with
15N-labelled
NaNO 2and non-labelled NH 4Cl at 25/C14C. We estimated ana-
mmox activity from29N2production during incubation. Net
N2production by anammox was calculated from gross29N2
concentration by deducting (1) contamination from29N2in
ambient air and (2)29N2production via denitri ﬁcation using
15NO 2/C0and14NO 2/C0c o n t a m i n a t i o ni nt h er e a g e n to f15NO 2/C0.
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of anammox
bacteria
Flocs in mixed liquor sampled from the aeration tank in
April 2016 were fractionated using sieves with mesh sizesof 2, 1, and 0.5 mm. Total DNA was extracted twice from
each ﬂoc size using a FastDNA SPIN kit for soil (MP Bio,
Tokyo, Japan), bulked, and puri ﬁed with a QIAEX II gel
extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The abundance
of anammox bacterial 16S rRNA genes was determined
in triplicate by quantitative polymerase chain reaction(qPCR) ampli ﬁcation using SsoAdvanced SYBR Green
Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA, USA);
qPCR was performed in 96-well optical plates in a real-
time PCR detection system (MyiQ2, Bio-Rad) with theanammox-speci ﬁc primer sets S-*-Amx-0368-a-A-18 and
AMX820, according to the method of Suto et al. ().
Pyrosequencing analysis
Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes was conducted using
ﬂoating granules (collected in March 2014) and sieved
ﬂocs (April 2016), following real-time qPCR analysis,
which ampli ﬁed the forward primer 563F and four mixed
reverse primers, R1 –4(Zhang et al. a). Each ampli ﬁca-
tion reaction mixture (10 μL) contained 1 ng total DNA,
0.5 U Ex Taq Hot Start Version (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan),
1μL1 0 ×Ex buffer, 0.8 mM deoxynucleotide triphosphate,
and 0.5 μM of each primer. The following steps were used
for PCR ampli ﬁcation: the mixture was kept at 95
/C14C for
5 min, denatured for 30 cycles at 95/C14C for 30 seconds,
annealed at 55.8/C14C for 30 seconds, and extended at 72/C14C
for 1 min. This was followed by a ﬁnal extension at 72/C14C
for 10 min.
PCR products were puri ﬁed with an AMPure XP
(Beckman Coulter, CA, USA). The puri ﬁed amplicons
were paired-end sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform
(Illumina, CA, USA) according to the standard protocols.Reads thus obtained were processed using Sickle ( https://
github.com/najoshi/sickle ) to trim bases with quality
values of less than 20. Reads of less than 41 bases afterquality trimming were discarded with the counterpart
paired-end reads. The quality- ﬁltered paired-end reads
were deposited in the DDBJ database under BioProject acces-sion number PRJDB8118 and BioSample accession numbers
SAMD00165693-SAMD00165696 and SAMD00165699 and
were merged via FLASH ( Magoc ̌&S a l z b e r g )w i t ht h e

on 17 September 2021RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Anammox characteristics
A red bio ﬁlm has been observed in the swine-wastewater
treatment facility since at least March 2012 (SupplementaryFigure 2). During the study period, the red bio ﬁlm was pre-
sent on the wall of the ﬁrst aeration tank and in later stages.
High concentrations of anammox activity have beenmeasured in the red bio ﬁlms ( Suto et al. ). A maximum
anammox activity of 115 μmol N
2/g IL/h was measured,
and anammox DNA copy numbers in the bio ﬁlm were
1.2×108–2.0×1010copies/g IL (from surveys in October
2014 and February 2015). Red granules ﬂoating in the sedi-
mentation tanks were often observed during winter(Supplementary Figure 2(d) and 2(e)). These granules
showed anammox activity as high as 339 ±73μmol N
2/g
IL/h (March 2014) and 439 ±74μmol N 2/g IL/h (January
2019). Additionally, small ﬂocs were found in the suspended
solids in the ﬁrst aeration tank. When ﬂocs were fractio-
nated by size into >2, 1–2, 0.5 –1, and <0.5 mm groups,
the larger ﬂocs showed higher anammox concentrations
with a maximum of 7.9 ×1011copies/g IL (April 2016,
Figure 1 ). The highest anammox DNA copy number was
about one-tenth of that in enriched anammox sludge,namely 6.23 ×10
12copies/g VSS ( Baeet al. ).
The pyrosequencing analysis showed that the ﬂoating
red granules contained Planctomycetes in 62.5% of totalreads ( Figure 2(a) ). Planctomycetes content in fractionated
ﬂocs varied from 0.3 to 37.2%, with larger ﬂocs having a
higher frequency. In the ﬂoating red granules and ﬂocs of
>2o r1 –2 mm, 56.1 –99.0% of Planctomycetes were ident-
iﬁed as Candidatus Jettenia and 10.9 –33.3% as Candidatus
Brocadia ( Figure 2(b) ). In contrast, in the smaller ﬂocs,
bacteria unrelated to anammox accounted for most ofthe Planctomycetes . Candidatus Jettenia or Candidatus
Brocadia are the typical anammox bacteria in wastewater
treatment systems ( Pereira et al. ). The red bio ﬁlm on
the wall, ﬂoating ﬂocs, and granules in this study contained
a high anammox concentration, and they were present
continuously during the study period.
Proﬁles of water temperature, DO concentration,
and pH
The pro ﬁles of water temperature, DO concentration, and
pH in the ﬁrst aeration tank are shown in Figure 3(a) and
3(b). The water temperature rose and fell according to seaso-
nal changes in ambient temperature. During the studyperiod, the average temperature was 22.8 ±6.7
/C14C (average
±s.d.), with a maximum of 34.2/C14C and minimum of 10.1/C14C.
As mentioned above, red granules ﬂoating in the sedimen-
tation tanks were often observed during the winter
(Figure 3(a) ). DO concentration in the aeration tank was
unintentionally maintained at as low as 0.31 ±0.39 mg/L

on 17 September 2021(Figure 3(b) ). However, occasional sudden increases to a
maximum concentration of 2.0 mg/L were observed; a mini-mum concentration of 0.06 mg/L was recorded.
The average pH in the aeration tank was neutral, at
7.35±0.49 ( Table 1 ). However, it varied, with minimum
and maximum recorded values of 6.0 and 8.1, respectively.The pH value decreased when the DO concentration
increased ( Figure 3(b) ). The high DO concentration likely
enhanced ammonium oxidation, producing hydrogen ions,which accounted for the observed pH decrease. The
increase in DO concentration was likely caused by a low
inﬂuent concentration due to factors such as a change in
the number of feeding swine or dilution by rain water.
BOD removal
BOD concentration in the in ﬂuent was 1,104 ±513 mg/L
(Table 1 ). The in ﬂuent ﬂow rate was 14 ±3m
3/d, and the
volumetric BOD loading rate in the ﬁrst aeration tank was
0.32±0.12 kg/m3/d, which was within the average range
of loading rates for swine-wastewater treatment but still rela-
tively low. In ﬂuent BOD concentration varied from 555 to2,500 mg/L due to changes in the number of feeding swine
and varying weather conditions ( Figure 4 ). However, in
theﬁnal ef ﬂuent, i.e. the ef ﬂuent from the second sedimen-
tation tank, a BOD concentration of 44 ±27 mg/L was
recorded, representing a BOD removal ef ﬁciency of 95 ±
4%. Despite the ﬂuctuating BOD concentration in the in ﬂu-
ent, BOD removal was high and stable in this treatment
system. Since heterotrophs have a high growth rate and
high af ﬁnity for DO, it was estimated that the BOD removal
rate would be high even in conventional activated sludge
processing of swine wastewater with a low DO concen-
tration ( Waki et al. ).
Nitrogen removal
TN and total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) concentrations in the
inﬂuent were 629 ±198 and 457 ±128 mg/L, respectively
(Table 1 ,Figure 5(a) ). The volumetric TIN loading rate in
theﬁrst aeration tank was 0.13 ±0.03 kg/m3/d (Figure 5(b) )
and the TN concentration ﬂuctuated in a similar way to the
BOD concentrations, with a minimum of 290 mg/L and a
maximum of 1,070 mg/L. TIN decreased to 146 ±92 mg/L

on 17 September 2021in the ﬁrst aeration tank, and TN decreased to 154 ±92 mg/L
in the second sedimentation tank, with TIN and TN removalsof 68±17 and 75 ±14%, respectively, and a TIN removal
rate of 0.09 ±0.03 kgN/m
3/d in the ﬁrst aeration tank. TIN
removal was unsteady, unlike BOD removal, and occurredmostly in the ﬁrst aeration tank; TIN removal was similar
in the ﬁrst and later aeration tanks, namely 70 ±16% in the
ﬁrst sedimentation tank, 70 ±17% in the second aerationtank, and 72 ±16% in the second sedimentation tank.
Inorganic nitrogen compounds in the ﬁrst aeration tank
were ammonium and nitrite in most cases ( Figure 5(a) ).
Concomitant with decreased and increased pH, FNA and
FN had concentrations of 0 –0.76 mg/L and 0.008 –
26.7 mg/L, respectively ( Figure 5(c) ).

in the in ﬂuent are important factors for nitrogenTable 1 |Wastewater characteristics of the in ﬂuent and the ef ﬂuent

concentration in the aeration tank and inorganic nitro-gen removal under each temperature condition ( /C2020,
20–30, and /C2130
/C14C), revealing that high nitrogen removal
occurred at DO concentrations of 0.3 mg/L or less under
every temperature condition. The average nitrogenremoval at DO concentrations of less than 0.3 mg/L
was 61 ±14% ( /C2020
/C14C), 78 ±16% (20 –30/C14C), and 75 ±

(/C2020/C14C), 55 ±16% (20 –30/C14C), and 68% ( /C2130/C14C) of
nitrogen was removed. The average BOD/TN ratio inthe in ﬂuent was 1.78 ±0.58 ( Table 1 ), but it ﬂuctuated
from 1.0 to 3.3. Figure 6(b) shows the relationship
between the BOD/TN ratio in the in ﬂuent and inorganic
nitrogen removal under each temperature condition
(/C2020, 20 –30, and /C2130

on nitrogen removal was seen.

on 17 September 2021Accumulation of nitrite ( Figure 5(a) ) and low DO con-
centration in the ﬁrst aeration tank ( Figure 6(a) ) suggests
that simultaneous nitri ﬁcation and denitri ﬁcation via nitrite
(short-cut nitri ﬁcation and denitri ﬁcation) occurred in the
ﬁrst aeration tank, under low DO concentrations ( Waki
et al. ). The fact that ammonium was also present in
theﬁrst aeration tank suggests that the anammox substrates
were present in signi ﬁcant concentrations in the ﬁrst aera-
tion tank. As mentioned already, anammox took place in
the facility studied. It is thought that a BOD/TN of more
than 3 is required for enough nitrogen removal by conven-tional nitri ﬁcation and denitri ﬁcation, even in sequencing
batch reactor processes ( Osada et al. ;Kim et al. ).
Since short-cut nitri ﬁcation and denitri ﬁcation can theoreti-
cally reduce 40% of organic carbon sources ( Sunet al. ),
it is estimated that a BOD/TN of more than 1.8 is required
for enough nitrogen removal by short-cut nitri ﬁcation and
denitri ﬁcation. In Figure 6(b) , it could be said that a TIN
removal of more than 95% with a BOD/TN of 1.5 and 1.6
was caused not only by short-cut nitri ﬁcation and denitri ﬁ-
cation but also by anammox, namely, the SNAD process.
In our study, a higher nitrogen removal was observed at
lower DO concentrations in the aeration tank ( Figure 6(a) ).
Therefore, for optimal SNAD operating conditions in swine-wastewater treatment, the DO concentration should be
maintained at /C200.3 mg/L. Furthermore, in a previous
laboratory-scale SNAD study on swine-waste anaerobicdigestion liquor, DO concentration was set below
0.5 mg/L ( Daverey et al. ). These processes operated
with in ﬂuents with lower BOD/N ratios than in our study
(BOD versus ammonium concentrations of 288 ±229
versus 519 ±134 mg/L for Daverey et al. (
)compared
to 1,104 ±513 versus 457 ±128 mg/L for this study). How-
ever, the DO concentration in our study was almost thesame as the concentrations indicated by the above-mentioned
SNAD study, and its importance was recon ﬁrmed.
FA and FNA concentrations were concomitant
with high and low pH values, respectively. Various inhibit-
ing FA and FNA threshold concentrations have been
proposed, e.g. FA concentrations of 9.7 –146, 0.097 –0.996,
and 57 –187 mg/L and FNA concentrations of 0.671 –9.4,
0.201 –2.786, and 0.006 –0.213 mg/L for ammonium-
oxidising bacteria, nitrite-oxidising bacteria, and anammox,respectively ( Van Hulle et al. ;Jinet al. ). In our
study, increases in FA and FNA concentrations were also
observed ( Figure 5(c) ). However, during SNAD, low pH
values were caused by increased DO concentration, andthe negative effect on the TIN removal rate was caused
by a combination of conditions, including high DO
concentration. As previously stated, maintaining DO con-centrations below 0.3 mg/L would avoid the negative
effects of low pH and high FNA concentration.
In this study, despite a relatively low average in ﬂuent
BOD/N ratio of 1.78, inorganic nitrogen removal was
higher than 80% on 30% of sampling days, with a maximum
of 98.5%. These results indicated that successful nitrogenremoval could be achieved by SNAD. In the facility studied,anammox bio ﬁlm was unintentionally maintained. The pres-
ence of naturally occurring anammox suggests that SNAD is
suitable for swine wastewater treatment. In the full-scaleSNAD process for swine-wastewater treatment, maintaining
the DO concentration below 0.3 mg/L is a simple strategy to
maintain nitrogen removal. Additionally, in order to obtaina more stable removal ability even under such conditions,
it would be necessary to consider not only strict controls
for preventing DO from being too low, but also measuresagainst low temperatures in future research.
CONCLUSIONS
In a full-scale activated sludge treatment reactor for swinewastewater with an in ﬂuent BOD concentration of
1,104±513 mg/L, TN concentration of 629 ±198 mg/L,
and BOD/N ratio of 1.78 ±0.58, an anammox bio ﬁlm was
consistently present on the walls of the aeration tank over

on 17 September 2021the 2 year study period. BOD was consistently removed,
whereas nitrogen removal ﬂuctuated, with removal ef ﬁcien-
cies of 95 ±4% and 75 ±14%, respectively. Lower DO
concentrations in the aeration tank increased the TIN
removal rate, with a DO concentration of less than
0.3 mg/L being an indication of high nitrogen removal. Inthe full-scale plant studied, environmental conditions ﬂuctu-
ated, but SNAD for swine-wastewater treatment could be
consistently operated by considering DO concentration.
