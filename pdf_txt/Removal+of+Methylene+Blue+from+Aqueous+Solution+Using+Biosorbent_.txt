Abstract 
 
There is a considerable need for the removal of col our from wastewater or effluents. Currently, 
several physical and chemical processes are used fo r dyes wastewater treatment. However, these 
processes are of high cost and not efficient for th e treatment of wide range of wastewater. In this 
study, the waste fruit shell of Limonia Acidissima is used as a biosorbent. The powdered raw 
material and treated material of specific micron si ze is used for the removal of the methylene 
blue from aqueous solution. The applicability of th is treated material and raw material as an 
adsorbent for organic pollutant removal was studied  and optimum conditions were evaluated for 
efficient adsorption of methylene blue. The results  show that the removal of dye by chemically 
treated material is effective than raw material at higher temperature. The percentage removal of 
dye is maximum at 35 0C for treated material and at 25 0C for raw material.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Many industries use dyes in order to colour their p roducts and pour a lot of coloured wastewater 
into the effluent.  The discharge of dye-bearing wastewater into natura l streams and rivers from 
the textile, paper, carpet, leather, distillery and  printing industries possesses severe problems. 
Recently, about 9000 types of dyes have been incorp orated in the colour index . The wastewater 
discharged from dying processes is highly coloured,  hot, alkaline and contain high amounts of 
dissolved solids. [1] Dyes even in low concentrations affect the aquatic life and food web. Due to 
low biodegradability of dyes, the discharge of colo ured wastewater from these industries 
damages the environment, as they are carcinogenic a nd toxic to human and aquatic life. [2,3] The R. C. Torane et al                                                  Der Pharma Chemica, 2010, 2 (3): 171-177

www.scholarsresearchlibrary.com  discharge of coloured wastes into streams not only affects  the aesthetic nature but also interfere 
with transmission of sunlight into streams and ther efore reduce photosynthetic activity. Most of 
the dyes are very stable either to photo degradatio n, biodegradation or oxidizing agents. 
 
The removal of dyes from wastewater is of great con cern, since some dyes and their degradation 
products may be harmful and consequently, their tre atment cannot depend on biodegradation 
alone. [4] 
 
Dyes laden wastewater is usually treated by physica l and chemical processes. These include 
flocculation, electro-flotation, precipitation, ele ctro-kinetic coagulation, ion exchange, membrane 
filtration, electrochemical destruction, irradiatio n and ozonation. However these processes are 
costly [5] and cannot effectively be used to treat the wide ra nge of wastewater containing dyes. 
Adsorption using activated carbon has been found to  be superior to other techniques for 
wastewater treatment in terms of initial cost, simp licity of design, ease of operation and 
insensitivity to toxic substances. Activated carbon  is a form of carbon that is specially treated to 
produce a highly developed internal pore structure and a large surface area, thus producing 
reasonably cheaper and excellent adsorbent . [6-8]

There is a multitude of industrial applications of activated carbon. Pollution control and 
wastewater treatment are growing areas of use to co mbat environmental pollution.  [6-9] Due to

adsorbent for dye sorption from wastewater are list ed in Table1. 
 
The aim of present study  was to investigate the optimum conditions for the r emoval of a cationic 
dye from aqueous solution by adsorption technique u sing sulphuric acid treated fruit shell. 
 
MATERIAL AND METHOD 
 
Preparation of adsorbent 
The fruit shell of Limonia Acidissima  was collected from nearby area of Pune, Maharashtra , 
India. Material was dried, crushed and powdered raw  material (PRM) was obtained, sieved to get 
uniform size (63 mesh). 
 
The crushed raw material (100g) was treated with A.  R. grade concentrated H 2 SO 4 (70 ml) and 
kept in an oven at 1200C for six hours. The carbonized material was then w ashed with distilled 
water to get it free from acid and dried at 105 0C for 18 hours. The dried treated material (TM) 
was grounded and sieved to get uniform size (63 mes h). 
 
Preparation of dye solution   
Methylene blue [3, 9-bis dimethyl-aminophenazo thio nium chloride], a cationic dye (Figure 1) , 
was purchased from Merck and used as received witho ut further purification. The stock solution 
of methylene blue 1x10 -5 M was prepared in distilled water.

Adsorption study:   
To evaluate the efficiency of adsorbents, laborator y batch mode studies were conducted at 
different temperatures. In each adsorption experime nt, 50 ml of dye solution of known 
concentration at initial pH of solution was added i nto 0.050gm of adsorbent in a 100 ml flask and 
the mixtures was stirred at 500 rpm on a mechanical  stirrer. After predetermined time intervals, 
adsorbent was separated from solution by filtration  method. The absorbance of the supernant 
solution was estimated to determine the residual dy e concentration at 660 nm with 
Spectrophotometer (EQ-650- A EquipTronics).  
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
In case of treated material percent removal of meth ylene blue from aqueous solution is maximum 
as compared to powdered raw material. Increase in p ercent removal for treated material is due to R. C. Torane et al                                                  Der Pharma Chemica, 2010, 2 (3): 171-177

temperature increases, percent removal of methylene  blue from aqueous solution decreases. This 
indicates physisorption process. In treated materia l results show that percent removal first 
increases and then decrease with increases in tempe rature. This indicates chemisorption process. 
The results are summarized in Tables and Figures 2- 4 .

CONCLUSION 
 
Temperature dependence of adsorption process is a c omplex phenomenon. Thermodynamic 
parameters, like heat of adsorption and energy of a ctivation play an important role in predicting 
the adsorption behavior and both are strongly depen dent on temperature. Temperature rise 
affects the solubility and chemical potential of th e adsorption, the latter being a controlling factor  
for adsorption. The result shows that the removal o f dyes by chemically treated material is 
effective than raw material at higher temperature. The percentage removal of dye is maximum at 
35 0C for treated material and at 25 0C for raw material.
