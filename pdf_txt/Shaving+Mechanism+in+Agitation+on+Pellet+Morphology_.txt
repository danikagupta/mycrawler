Abstract
Bioprocesses with fungal biomass have been the subject of a growing interest in biotechnology industry because they represent
a rich source of enzymes, antibiotics, vitamins, and complex metabolites, which have a great potential for pharmaceutical,
agricultural, and environmental applications, among others. Filamentous fungi have di erent growth patterns (as mycelia, clumps,
and pellets) in industrial processes. Therefore, the study of the morphology presented by this group of organisms is necessary to
establish the conditions of production of new products or to improve the existing processes, even at the laboratory scale. Among
the various forms of fungal growth, the formation of pellets represents many advantages in bioprocesses, and thus it is interesting
to determine the factors that induce it. This manuscript describes the state of the art of fungal pellets, provides information on
conditions of both inoculation and incubation that favor the formation of pellets at laboratory scale, as well as the advantages,
applications and perspectives that pellets have in the ﬁeld of biotechnology.
Keywords : fungal biomass, bioprocess, metabolites, hairy region, ﬁlamentus fungi.

1Introduction
Biotechnology of fungi has allowed the industrial
exploitation of their intrinsic biochemical activities.
The most attractive group for biotechnological
processes are the so-called ﬁlamentous fungi or
molds, which impact our lives in many ways (Torres-
Barajas and Aguilar-Osorio, 2013; Ward, 2012;Meyer, 2008). This term designates the group of
species that produces ﬁlaments in the form of hyphae,
which is more common for the Fungi kingdom.
The term is also used in contrast to yeasts, which
are essentially unicellular fungi with the ability to
reproduce repeatedly (Evans, 1988).
Filamentous fungi are heterotrophic eukaryotic
microorganisms that depend on external sources of
carbon and can reproduce sexually or asexually

(Piepenbring et al., 2015). The mycelium is composed
of hyphae, which are the basic units of ﬁlamentous
fungi with a strong cell wall (Steinberg, 2007). This
cell wall is composed of polysaccharides (chitin
and-glucan) and glycoproteins that determine the
ﬁbrillar structure of the wall (Preechasuth et al., 2015;
Serrano-Carre ´onet al., 2015).
The growth of the hypha takes place in the apical
region. When a new limb is formed, it grows to a
determined length and a septum with a nucleus is
created in the posterior part to the tip. These septa are
invaginations of the cellular wall that limit the plasma
membrane and contain a central pore of 50-500 nm
that allows the transmission of cytosol and organelles
as in Ascomycota and Basidiomycota (V oisey, 2010;
Patnaik, 2000). The result of the apical extension is the
formation of non-propagating cells, which eventually
produce vacuoles. These, in turn, grow as a function
of their distance to the apical region (Figure 1). Since
the mycelial region is complex and multicellular, the
age distribution of the cells is extensive compared with
the unicellular microorganisms. In turn, the growth
of hyphae allows the fungus to explore a wide area
in search of nutrients (Sietsma and Wessels, 2006).
Therefore, hyphae may exist in several physiological
states. Their structure and characteristics may be
dierent for each group, such as apical growth cells,
regions with vacuoles, and lysed cells, the last being
metabolically inactive (Serrano-Carre ´onet al., 2015).

4) septum and 5) no propagative region.The bacterial biomass has ﬁlaments too. However,
concerning the mechanism of cell growth, these
two groups show large di erences. Eukaryotic fungi
are organisms that present a complex morphology
with cell organelles and a cytoskeleton directly
linked to growth, whereas ﬁlamentous bacteria or
Actinobacteria do not have such a cellular organization
(Driouch et al., 2010).
In spite of these di erences, the two groups
show similarities in their morphology, growth patterns,
growth forms, and kinetic growth of hyphae and
mycelia in both solid and liquid media. Yet, fungal
biomass presents a number of advantages over bacteria
from the industrial point of view, namely, the larger
number of enzymes produced, the removal of complex
contaminants of both organic and inorganic origin,
their endurance to ﬂuctuations in pollutant loads,
and their resistance to low pH and nutrient levels
(Espinosa-Ortiz et al., 2016; Moreira et al., 2003).
2Morphologies of ﬁlamentous
fungi
The morphology of fungal biomass in liquid cultures
has been established as an important parameter in
bioprocesses. In the growth of ﬁlamentous fungi,
diverse forms can be recognized. The common pattern
of growth of the ﬁlamentous fungi is from a hypha
that forms a criss-cross network, which we refer
to as mycelium. Finally, the pellets are aggregates
of strongly-interlaced, spherical or semi-spherical,
compact hyphae (Figure 2) (Cai et al., 2014; Liu and
Wu, 2012; ˘Znidar ˘si˘c and Pavko, 2001; Gibbs et al .,
2000; Cui et al., 1997). In addition, the term “clump”
is often used to describe small aggregates of mycelium
or large and heavy masses of aggregated mycelium.
Between 80,000 and 120,000 species of fungi
have been identiﬁed with di erent morphologies. Even
the same species can give rise to di erent forms
depending on the conditions of cultivation to which
they are submitted (Zhang and Zhang, 2016).
Due to the problem of controlling the morphology
of fungi in bioprocesses, the automation of their
production processes has been di cult. This is the
case for the production of Penicillin G from species
of the genus Penicillium (˘Znidar ˘si˘c and Pavko,
2001). Submerged fungal cultures normally result
in excessive growth of mycelium, which hinders
mass transfer and the production and excretion rates

of metabolites (Wucherpfennig et al ., 2010). The
excessive growth of fungal mycelium can obstruct
the sampling channels in bioreactors, as well as in
the nutrient addition lines and mixers, resulting in
the increase in the viscosity of the medium and
limitations in mass and oxygen transfer, among other
disadvantages. These obstacles in the use of fungal
biomass restrict the operation time of the bioreactor,
whereby batch cultures are preferred, and in which
the fungi are grown for short periods of time, and the
culture medium is then discarded to start a new batch
(Moreira et al., 2003).
3Fungal immobilization
This technique can be deﬁned as the adhesion of the
biomass to a solid or porous matrix that limits the
free migration of cells. This technique represents a
solution to many common problems in bioprocesses.
In general, there are two types of immobilization:
(1) ﬁxation, in which the microorganisms adhere to
the surface by themselves or by chemical bonding
and (2) entrapment, which involves the retention of
microorganisms at the intersections or pores of ﬁbrous
materials or are physically trapped within a solid or
porous matrix (Figure 3) (Sun et al., 2010; Moreira et
al., 2003; Khoo and Ting, 2001).
Filamentous fungi show a natural inclination to
adhere to surfaces and thus to be immobilized.
Research on adhesion mechanisms is still limited, but
macromolecules located on the surface of ﬁlamentous
fungi, such as polysaccharides, seem to act as a kind
of “glue” to initiate surface microbial interactions
(Moreira et al., 2003).

Fig. 3. Immobilized mycelium of Cladosporium
cladosporioides inLua cylindrica , before and after
the secretion of a pigment.
In industrial bioprocesses, the fungal immobilized
biomass has been the solution to di erent problems,
such as the di culty of separation of microbial cells
from medium after biosorption, mass losses during
separation and low mechanical strength and small
particle size, which make problematic the use of
fungal biomass in batch and continuous systems.
Further, the immobilization may extend the life of
biocatalyst and facilitate its recovery and reuse.
Finally, the separation of products from immobilized
cells is easier than that from suspended cells (Velasco-
Bucheli et al., 2017; Arica et al., 2004).
The fungal immobilization is achieved using
natural polymers (i.e., alginate, chitosan, chitin, lua
and cellulose derivates) or synthetic polymers (i.e.
polyurethane foam, among others). Some ﬁndings
show a correlation between the fungal products and
the support used in the immobilization. Velasco-
Bucheli et al. (2017) found that the production of 1-
phenylpropane-1,3-diol by the fungus Colletotrichum
acutatum was clearly dependent on the support used
(polyurethane), which was reused at least 3 or 4
times without signiﬁcant loss of activity. Additionally,
the immobilization technique brings many beneﬁts
to fungal bioremediation, such as a higher e ciency
of pollutants degradation, multiple uses of the
biocatalysts, reduced costs due to the elimination
of the cell ﬁltration stage, the ensuring of a stable
microenvironment for cells and enzymes, a reduced
risk of genetic mutations, resistance to shear forces
present in bioreactors, increased biocatalyst survival
during storage, and increased tolerance to high
pollutants concentrations and adverse environmental
conditions (Dzionek et al., 2016).
Thus, the formation of pellets can be considered
as a form of self-immobilization, resulting in the
agglomeration of mycelium. Production and yield of
www.rmiq.org 705Garc´ ıa-Reyes et al. /Revista Mexicana de Ingenier ´ıa Qu ´ımica V ol. 16, No. 3 (2017) 703-720
the metabolites are in function of the morphology of
the fungus. An example of this case is a study aimed to
compare the production of lactic acid and fumaric acid
byRhizopus oryzae in the form of pellets and clumps
under the same culture conditions (24 g L 1PDB,
6.0 g L 1peptone of soybean, 6.0 g L 1of CaCO 3,
inoculum of 1 :5109spores L 1, 27 °C and 190
rpm). When using pellets of R. oryzae , the maximum
concentrations produced were 65 g L 1of lactic acid
after 30 h, and of 31.0 g L 1of fumaric acid after 96 h.
In contrast, when biomass in the form of clumps was
used, concentrations of 20 g L 1of lactic acid and 21.5
g L 1of fumaric acid were reached after 30 h and 96
h of culture, respectively (Liao et al., 2007a).
Industrially, the formation of metabolites,
especially secondary metabolites, occurs only when
the fungal biomass grows as pellets (Junker et
al., 2004). This is the case of the production of
itaconic acid by Aspergillus terreus , citric acid and
polygalacturonases by Aspergillus niger , cellulolytic
enzymes by Trichoderma reesei , and-galactosidases
byMortierella vinaceae . This morphology is also
necessary for the synthesis of ergot alkaloids by the
ﬁlamentous fungus Claviceps purpurea (Zhang and
Zhang, 2016; Liu et al., 2008; ˘Znidar ˘si˘c and Pavko,
2001).
4Morphology of fungal pellets
Fungal pellets are aggregates of hyphae that have
a circular, ellipsoidal or oval shape, ranging in size
from a few micrometers to several millimeters. The
history of fungal growth in the form of pellets dates
back to the late nineteenth century. Metz and Kossen
(1977) carried out a bibliographical review about the
morphology of pellets in fungi and found that authors
like Ray had reported, in 1897, the formation of
spherical colonies of Aspergillus candidus . Later, in
1933, Kluyver and Perquin reported the observation
of mycelial beads of Aspergillus ﬂavus . In a fungal
pellet, four main regions are observed (Figure 4): i)
The ﬁrst is a semi-anaerobic compact region (R1)
constituting the nucleus of the pellet; (ii) the second
region (R2) is a layer surrounding the nucleus, which
may di er among fungal pellets because some of them
are hollow; iii) in the third region (R3), the hyphae
already begin to show signs of autolysis, and iv) the
fourth region (R4) is the area of viable hyphae or
“hairy region”, which is the most metabolically active
part of the pellet (Espinosa-Ortiz et al., 2016).

The growth in pellet form is an important
parameter for all fungi used in industry (Anuradha
et al., 2014). The following are the main advantages
and disadvantages of using fungal pellets (Espinosa-
Ortiz et al., 2016; FazeliNejad et al., 2016; Krull et al.,
2013; Nyman et al., 2013; Pamboukian et al., 1998).
Advantages:
The high productivity of biomass and the easy
separation of the medium.
The improved rheology of the medium (low
viscosity, Newtonian ﬂuid behavior).
The lower energy consumption for maintaining
stable temperatures in the process.
The greater mass transfer.
It allows the continuous operation and the reuse
of the biomass.
The better transfer of mass, oxygen, and
nutrients, due to the contact surface.
The low obstruction e ect.
The easy process scale-up.
The high viable cell loading and volumetric
productivity.
706 www.rmiq.orgGarc´ ıa-Reyes et al. /Revista Mexicana de Ingenier ´ıa Qu ´ımica V ol. 16, No. 3 (2017) 703-720
The low adhesion of biomass to the surface of
the bioreactor.
Disadvantages:
Limited transport of oxygen and nutrients to the
cell nucleus, resulting in zones with di erent
growth and metabolic patterns.
Some pellets may present autolysis.
Non-uniform size of pellets.
5Forces involved in the formation
of fungal pellets
Two types of forces are involved in the formation of
fungal pellets from spores: non-speciﬁc interactions
(NSI) and speciﬁc interactions in spore cell wall
components (SICW).
NSI include electrostatic interactions (van
der Waals forces and electrostatic repulsion) and
hydrophobicity (Zhang and Zhang, 2016). In
general, microbial cells, including fungal spores,
are negatively charged, but it has been shown that
spores show di erent charges on their surface with
dierent isoelectric points. For example, Paecilomyces
fumosoroseus is negatively charged under neutral
conditions, with an isoelectric point of 3.4 (Zhang
and Zhang, 2016). The negative charges of the spores
can be evidenced as electrophoretic mobility (MEF)
or zeta potential (Wargenau et al ., 2013; Wargenau
et al ., 2011), according to colloidal science. The
MEF of microorganisms depends on pH and cations
(concentration, ionic strength, and oxidation state). An
augmentation in the pH value increases MEF in the
negative direction and decreases spore aggregation.
On the other hand, hydrophobicity consists of speciﬁc
interactions of the components of the cell wall of
the spores, and it is a determining factor in their
aggregation and in the adhesion of the microorganisms
to the surfaces (Priegnitz et al., 2012). Hydrophobicity
is produced by active surface proteins, hydrophobins,
found in spores and aerial mycelium, but not in the
vegetative mycelium. There are also the so-called
repellent proteins, present in some species such as
Botrytis cinerea andUstilago maydis , which have a
similar function to that of hydrophobins.
Concerning the SICW, the main components of
the cell wall of the spores responsible for this type of
interaction are chitin, glucan, hydrophobins, melanin,ions, proteins, and lipids. Di erent components
provide di erent MEF values because from the spore
stage to the formation of the hyphae, they exhibit
dierent charges due to variations in their chemical
composition (Gougouli and Koutsoumanis, 2013). The
greatest contrast between the wall of the spore and
the hyphae is in their content of carbohydrates and
proteins. The wall of the spore contains 2.5% of
carbohydrates while the hypha contains 64.5%. On the
other hand, the spore wall contains 63.4% of protein,
while the hypha contains only 6.6%.
Similarly, by their type of formation, the fungal
pellets are divided into two types: coagulative and non-
coagulative (Grim et al ., 2005). Coagulative pellets
(made by some species of the phyla Ascomycota and
Basidiomycota), can be formed in two ways depending
on the formation of aggregates when the spores
are incubated. On the one hand, some aggregates
are formed six to eight hours after the spores are
incubated; these aggregates form a nucleus and give
rise to the growth of hyphae, which in turn form
pellets. The formation of coagulative pellet depends
on the concentration of the inoculated spores, and
many studies agree that the pellets of the Aspergillus
species are of this type. On the other hand, coagulative
pellets can also be formed when the spore aggregates
germinate to form pellets directly. In this case, the
rate of spore aggregation is linear to the pellet growth
(Zhang and Zhang, 2016; Meyer, 2008).
In non-coagulative pellets (such as those formed
by some species of phylum Zygomycota and by
others belonging to the phylum Ascomycota), the
germination of a single spore results in the formation
of the pellet. This type of granulation occurs under
strong agitation and aeration regimes.

non-coagulative pellets (Zhang and Zhang, 2016).

An example of this mechanism is exhibited by
Aspergillus ochraceus . Table 1 shows some examples
of the classiﬁcation of the pellets according to their
formation process.
6Factors that inﬂuence the
morphological characteristics of
fungal pellets
As we have seen, there are many factors a ecting
the formation and morphology of fungal pellets, such
as agitation, nutrient concentration in the medium,
pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration,
presence of additives or surfactants, viscosity of
the medium, inoculum size and inoculation and
incubation conditions, among others (Steinberg, 2007;
Saraswathy and Hallberg, 2005; Nielsen, 1996; Olsvik
and Kristiansen, 1994). These factors a ect di erently
each strain, e.g. Rhizopus spp. require vigorous
agitation to form pellets, whereas in the case of
Penicillium chrysogenum , an alkaline pH is necessary
to induce their formation. In this way, the study of the
formation of pellets must be performed individually
for each strain (Liu et al., 2008). In general, factors
inﬂuencing the formation and morphology of fungal
pellets can be grouped as shown in Figure 5.
Hereunder, the main factors that inﬂuence the
morphological characteristics of fungal pellets are
presented.6.1 Inoculation
The ideal inoculum for the formation of fungal pellets
depends on the strain, since the cell shape and
quantity directly a ect the formation, growth, and
morphology of the pellets in submerged cultures. The
fungal life cycle begins and ends with sporulation
(Anuradha et al ., 2014), to which the formation of
pellets belongs, although some studies report the
formation of this morphology from a suspension of
hyphae or fragments of mycelium (Xin et al., 2012;
Casas et al., 2003; Nielsen, 1996). The production of
pellets is traditionally initiated with a spore solution
(usually<108spores mL 1) (Espinosa-Ortiz et al .,
2016). However, inducing a sporulation state in a
fungus is usually somewhat complicated for some
species, since sporulation is an inactive and survival
phase (Kumar and Attri, 2016). Once the conditions
for the development of spores have been found,
the germination process occurs, with which several
physical and chemical factors interfere. Although the
germination process is di cult to reach in liquid
cultures, the development of aerial conidiophores
ofAspergillus oryzae in submerged cultures has
been reported ( ˘Znidar ˘si˘c and Pavko, 2001). This
was achieved due to the abundance of nutrients
and to the natural physiology of the wall of the
hyphae. The asexual sporulation of the lower fungi
as Oomycetes and Zygomycetes (about 1,500 species:
aquatic, amphibious, and terrestrial as Rhizopus ), is
induced by the reduction of nutrients.

In contrast, the mechanisms that control the
sporulation and conidia formation in the high fungi
(Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes) di er between
species, although some studies have shown that the
major triggers of sporulation in these fungi may be
the limitation of both the nitrogen source and the
transport of the substrate to the interior of the mycelial
aggregates ( ˘Znidar ˘si˘c and Pavko, 2001). The spores
inoculation to form fungal pellets still poses a great
obstacle for their industrial popularization and wide
application (Xin et al ., 2010). On another hand, the
inoculation technique using ﬁlamentous mycelium to
produce pellets in a bubble column has proved to be a
convenient method, yielding many small pellets with
a fairly homogeneous size distribution (Gabriel et al.,
1996).
6.2 Composition of the medium
The source of carbon, nutrients and some additives,
such as polymers, surfactants, and chelates, are key
to the formation of pellets. Di erent carbon sources,
such as sucrose, glucose, fructose and xylose, have
been used to evaluate the induction of granulation
and their inﬂuence on morphology. Lactose has been
used as a carbon source for the growth of Aspergillus
niger as a dispersed mycelium (Espinosa-Ortiz et al.,
2016). The principal medium used in fungal culture for
the production of pellets is the PDB (potato dextrose
broth), which contains mainly glucose, some vitamins
and low nitrogen concentrations. Liao et al. (2007b)
compared the production of R. oryzae pellets using
PDB and glucose, and obtained higher yields with
the PDB medium. This was attributed to the e ect
of the vitamins it contains. In another study, Liu
et al . (2008) reported that lower concentrations of
PDB allowed a higher biomass yield ( YB=S=0.440
g g 1) of formed pellets. This was also attributed
to the e ect of its vitamin content. Nair et al .
(2016) evaluated various carbon sources, i.e., glucose,
arabinose, sucrose, and galactose in concentrations of
20 g L 1, and concluded that they did not present
a signiﬁcant e ect on the morphology of the pellets
ofNeurospora intermedia . It should be noted that
the carbon source, which showed the highest yield
in the biomass was arabinose ( YB=S=0.440 g
g 1), compared to the lower yield obtained with
galactose ( YB=S=0.184 g g 1). Garc ´ıa-Reyes (2016)
compared the formation of Cladosporium pellets in
PDB medium and in an infusion of Opuntia spp.,obtaining a greater production of pellets and biomass
in the infusion of Opuntia spp. (0.0638 g dry biomass,
n=119) than in PDB (0.0142 g dry biomass, n =22) at
pH 5. However, a comprehensive investigation of the
eects of medium composition and inoculum on pellet
formation and growth is lacking.
6.2.1 Incubation conditions
Another factor a ecting the morphology of the pellets
is the hydrodynamic conditions inside the bioreactor
since the laminar and turbulent regimes a ect the
pellets by the Reynolds number (Espinosa-Ortiz et
al., 2016). In a bubble column bioreactor (BCB),
the morphology of the pellets of Rhizopus nigricans
under a laminar regime produced homogeneous pellets
without signs of fragmentation. These same pellets,
when subjected to a turbulent regime, were fragmented
and in some cases destroyed. Several authors have
reported that vigorous agitation leads to strong and
compact fungal aggregates and that, on the contrary,
low agitation regimes produce large and less stable
aggregates. Such is the case of the pellets of
Neurospora intermedia , because a rate of 100 rpm
produced pellets with a diameter of 6.54 0.62 mm
while a rate of 150 rpm produced pellets of 1.92 0.33
mm (Espinosa-Ortiz et al., 2016; Nair et al., 2016; Liu
et al., 2008).
On the other hand, high agitation causes
hydrodynamic stress within the reactor, impacting the
growth of the regions of the pellet, which leads to a
rupture or a kind of “shaving” in the hairy region (case
of STR). Some authors have reported that it is possible
to obtain as much dispersed mycelium as new pellets
from this rupture of hyphae.
Aeration also plays an important role in the
morphology and the formation of pellets. In the case
ofAspergillus oryzae , continuous air ﬂows favor the
growth of the pellets, whereas a poor concentration
of oxygen can produce pellets with large diameters
and hollow nuclei (Cox and Thomas, 1992). Another
study shows the use of an oxygen pulse in a ﬂuidized
bed reactor to control the size and morphology of
the pellets of Aspergillus niger and Phanerochaete
chrysosporium , which resulted in uniform pellets and
high yields of the metabolite. This is because the area
most impacted by this factor is the hairy region (Zhang
and Zhang, 2016; Espinosa-Ortiz et al., 2016; Nair et
al., 2016; Liu et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2008; Moreira et
al., 1996).

6.3 pH
Another important factor in the formation of fungal
pellets is pH. Like the other variables, its e ect is
a function of the strain used, since, in several cases,
only a change in pH is necessary to induce to induce
the pellet form. As examples, the formation of pellets
ofPenicillium chrysogenum needs to be induced by
alkaline pH values (pH >7.4), or Rhizopus oryzae ,
which grows as pellets in an acid environments (pH 3
- 7). Neurospora intermedia forms pellets of uniform
size (2 - 3 mm) and produces a higher yield of ethanol
(YP=S=0.367 g g 1) in the pH range of 3 - 4. However,
it presents the highest biomass production at pH 9
(YB=S=0.452 g 1) (Nair et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2008;
Liao et al., 2007b; Metz and Kossen, 1997).
6.4 Temperature
The temperature directly a ects the formation and
morphology of the pellets. Liu et al. (2008) reported
that a temperature of 38°C favors the rapid formation
of pellets in cultures of Rhizopus oryzae . However,
this same temperature a ects the yield of the biomass,
compared to the use of temperatures between 22 and
33°C. ˘Znidar ˘si˘cet al. (2000) compared the e ect of
temperature (19 and 23°C) on the morphology of
Rhizopus nigricans pellets. The pellets obtained at
19°C were aggregates with smaller diameters (1.1 
0.3 mm) and with little or no region of viable hyphae,
whereas the pellets obtained at 23°C had a larger
diameter (1.3 0.4 mm) and pronounced regions of
viable hyphae.
6.5 Additives
Several authors have evaluated the e ect of various
additives on the formation of fungal pellets. The
granulation of Rhizopus oryzae , using a biodegradable
rice polymer at three concentrations (4, 10 and 20
g L 1) and with four di erent particle sizes (3 mm
x 5 mm, 1.4 mm and <0.6 mm), was evaluated.
An increase of 16% in the biomass production was
obtained at a concentration of 4 g L 1of the
biopolymer, while the particle size did not produce
signiﬁcant di erences ( P>0.05) in the pellets (Liu
et al ., 2008). Another study evaluated the e ect of
the addition of glycerol and calcium chloride onthe morphology of the Neurospora pellets. With the
addition of these compounds, small aggregates of the
compact nucleus and little growth in the “hairy region”
were obtained. However, both the biomass yield and
the ethanol production improved (Nair et al ., 2016).
Zhang and Zhang (2016) have reported the use of
microparticles (MgO-SiO 2-H2O, Al 2O3, TiSiO 4) to
form pellets. Finally, Liao et al. (2007b) have shown
the formation of smooth-appearing pellets by adding
mineral ions (KH 2PO4, MgSO 4, ZnSO 4) and CaCO 3
(as charge neutralizer) in the solution.
7Applications of fungal pellets
The production of large quantities of enzymes
(speciﬁc and non-speciﬁc) and of other metabolites
makes fungi interesting from an industrial point of
view. Their easy reuse (in the form of living or dead
biomass), as well as their adsorption capacity of heavy
metals, also allows the use of fungal pellets for the
removal of organic and inorganic contaminants from
aqueous wastes.
7.1 Production of metabolites
Fungal biomass in granular form is considered a
requisite for the successful production of metabolites,
such as citric acid, and enzymes, such as glucose
oxidase, polygalacturonase, phytase and glucoamylase
(Zhang and Zhang, 2016). Aspergillus niger is the
most used species in the industry due to the variety
of enzymes that it is able to produce (Table 2). The
production of various acids by this fungus requires the
formation of pellets; for example, 99% of citric acid
produced globally (about 1 :5106tons per year) is
produced by Aspergillus niger in granular form (Zhang
and Zhang, 2016; Reyes-Ocampo et al., 2013).
The production of certain metabolites or enzymes,
such as polygalacturonase, is also related to the size
of the pellets because a higher production of this
enzyme is associated to compact pellets. In many
cases, the fungus morphology is directly related to
the fermentation productivity (Papagianni, 2004). The
following are the main fungal metabolites (enzymes,
organic acids, and antibiotics) of industrial interest.

7.2 Biosorption
Biosorption is a physicochemical and metabolically
independent process carried out by biological material
and is based on a variety of mechanisms, such as
absorption, adsorption, ion exchange, surface complex
formation and precipitation (Fomina and Gadd, 2014;
Gadd, 2009). The biosorption processes have used
various species of fungi to remove three important
groups of organic pollutants:
(i) Synthetic dyes, wich are widely used in the
textile industry, as well as in the paper industry
and printing services. These organic pollutants
are usually associated with high concentrations
of COD, BOD, suspended solids, toxicity, and
color.
(ii) Phenols: These organic compounds are present
mainly in the wastewater of the pharmaceutical,
pulp and paper, and pesticide production
industries and solvents.
(iii) Finally, drug components ( e.g., anti-
inﬂammatory, analgesic, antibiotic, psychiatric,
and anticancer drugs): These microactive
organic pollutants are a major concern due to the
reduced e ciency of the wastewater treatment
plants to remove them (Espinosa-Ortiz et al .,
2016; Michalak et al., 2013).
Fungal pellets are also an alternative in biosorption
processes intended to remove metal ions in solution,
mainly due to the lower generation of toxic waste
and the lesser energy needs regarding conventional
treatments ( i.e., coagulation-ﬂocculation) (Espinosa-
Ortiz et al ., 2015; Bayramo ˘glu et al ., 2009;
Bayramo ˘glu and Arica, 2008). Some of the fungi that
have been used in the form of pellets for the removal
of contaminants from aqueous solutions are shown in
Table 3 (Pethkar et al., 2001; Filipovic-Kovacevic et
al., 2000; Gabriel et al., 1996).
The maximum adsorption capacity of metal ions
by fungal pellets occurs under acidic conditions (at
pH values comprised between three and six). The
biosorption processes of metal ions decrease abovepH six. This is due to the formation of insoluble
complexes under alkaline conditions (Filipovic-
Kovacevic et al., 2000). Some studies have reported
that optimum pH values needed to obtain high metal
ion removals in biosorption processes are lower than
ﬁve (Pethkar et al., 2001; Filipovic-Kovacevic et al.,
2000). In the biosorption processes, there are di erent
factors that a ect the capacity of the pellets to remove
metals, such as the morphology. Besides, when the
objective is the removal of several metals from
aqueous solutions by using pellets, the biosorption
process may require more time, as compared to the
removal of a single metal (Michalak et al., 2013).
In contrast to the metal ions biosorption process,
a strain of Aspergillus fumigatus is able to achieve
a biodecolorization of 90% of a dye (i.e., methylene
blue) in a range of pH of 7-13 (Kabbout and Taha,
2014). Filamentous fungi, mainly white rot fungi
and brown rot fungi, employ two mechanisms to
carry out the biodecolorization process, namely
adsorption and enzymatic degradation (Yang et
al., 2016; Hiu and Yien, 2015). During the
adsorption process, it has been observed that
temperature increases in the culture of fungal
pellets improve the biodecolorization e ciencies.
Likewise, it has been observed that biodecolorization
is more e ective under aerobic conditions (Sen
et al ., 2016). Concerning enzymatic degradation,
lignolytic enzymes that employ ﬁlamentous fungi for
biodecolorization are manganese peroxidase, laccase,
and lignin peroxidase (Sumandono et al., 2015). This
process depends on the composition of the solution
and its characteristics, such as pH, ionic strength, and
temperature (Kaushik and Malik, 2009).
7.3 New applications of fungal pellets
Fungi having a high oil content have been identiﬁed
recently. This opens the door to bioenergy research
with ﬁlamentous fungi. The most promising species
areMortierella isabellina and Mortierella alpine ,
which contain 86% of dry mass of fatty acids (Zhang
and Zhang, 2016).

Another innovative application of fungal pellets to
sewage treatment and biofuel production is their use as
immobilizing supports of other microorganisms, such
as microalgae and yeasts in a co-culture (Choi et al.,
2016; Zhang and Zhang, 2016).
7.4 Limitations on the use of fungal pellets
in industry
The bioprocesses with fungal pellets present a number
of process engineering advantages, such as the
separation of liquid and solids in batch or continuousreactors, avoiding the use of the centrifugation or
ﬁltration in the process. For the fungal industrial
application in biosorption processes, immobilization
of biosorbent is necessary for solid /liquid separation.
However, more studies are needed to develop
industrial applications.
The majority of the studies of fungal pellet
formation have been developed in batch reactors at
laboratory scale, and a few in column reactors. One
of the major technological challenges in the fungal
pellet formation is the enhancement of the inoculation
www.rmiq.org 715Garc´ ıa-Reyes et al. /Revista Mexicana de Ingenier ´ıa Qu ´ımica V ol. 16, No. 3 (2017) 703-720
process in continuous reactors. This step would help
solve the scaling of the process.
Whereby, it is necessary the study of each
individual fungal strain for pellet formation because
the change in fungal morphology is inﬂuenced by
dierent factors: medium composition, inoculum, pH,
medium shear, additives, culture temperature, medium
viscosity and others. For example, Penicillium
chrysogenum requires high pH and some strains such
asRhizopus sp. need strong agitation to form pellets
(Liao et al., 2007; Metz and Kossen, 1977).
Conclusions and perspectives
The formation of fungal pellets and the control of
their morphology are complex processes that depend
mainly on the inoculum and incubation conditions.
These factors vary with each species, and, therefore,
it is not possible to establish a general methodology
for the formation of fungal pellets. The use of fungal
pellets is a subject that is extensively studied due to
their wide range of applications.
Many industries such as those of petroleum,
mining, solvent, paper and pulp, printing, iron-steel,
textile, coke, pesticide, paint, pharmaceutics and wood
preserving chemicals, discharge large volumes of
wastewater. Biosorption processes are a promising
alternative to replace or to enhance the available
treatment processes for the removal of pollutants
such as metals, dyes, phenolics and pesticides, among
others. Despite the success of the application of
fungal pellets in the removal of organic and inorganic
wastewater, its application has not been carried out on
an industrial scale yet.
Currently, the use of fungal pellets in industrial
bioprocesses provides several advantages, such as an
increased production of metabolites and a low cost of
production. For this reason, the study of new fungal
species is important since di erent metabolites and
applications are obtained every day for di erent ﬁelds
of biotechnology, such as the use of oily species or the
immobilization of algae or bacteria adhered in fungal
pellets in the area of bioenergies, among others.
