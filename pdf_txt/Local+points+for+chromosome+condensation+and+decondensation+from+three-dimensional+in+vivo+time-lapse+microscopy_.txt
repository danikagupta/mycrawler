viInteractions ofChromatin with theNuclear Envelope
Wallace F.Marshall
Abstract
Cytological studies have suggested thatchromosomes may benonrandomly arranged
inthenucleus, which raises twoquestions. First, towhat extent istheposition ofagiven
chromosomal locus determined within thenucleus, andsecond, towhat extent can a
given chromosomal locus move around within thenucleus. This work addresses these
twoquestions. Fluorescence insituhybridization (FISH) andthree-dimensional
microscopy were used todetermine theposition of41different DNA probes within the
nucleus inDrosophila melanogaster embryos. Every locus wasfound toreproducibly
occupy adistinct subregion ofthenucleus. Inparticular, byusing aMonte Carlo
statistical test, asetoflociwasidentified thatassociate reproducibly with thenuclear
envelope (NE). These NEassociation sites aredistributed throughout thegenome, spaced
atintervals ofroughly 1Mb. NEassociation sites donotcorrespond tobinding sites of
known Drosophila chromatin proteins, toknown boundary elements, ortoscaffold
attachment regions (SARs). NEassociation sites include both euchromatic and
heterochromatic regions, andnotallheterochromatin isNEassociated. The NE
associations defined bythiswork arenotseen intelophase andareestablished later in
interphase, demonstrating thatthisinteraction does notplay arole inpost-mitotic NE
reassembly.
Thehighly specific positioning observed byFISH raises thesecond question, is
chromatin mobile within theinterphase nucleus. Toanswer this, strategies were
developed formeasuring thediffusion ofinterphase chromatin inDrosophila and
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Inboth cases itwasfound thatchromatin canindeed diffuse
within thenucleus, with adiffusion constant ofapproximately 10- 2cm2/s. Inyeast, but
viinotDrosophila, thediffusion wasconstrained, implying thatthechromatin istethered to
aninternal nuclear structure. This diffusive motion islikely tobeBrownian asitis
unaffected bytreatment ofcells with azide, ametabolic inhibitor. Thediffusion constant
wasfound tobesurprisingly sizeindependent, such that asmall plasmid diffused slower,
rather than faster, than anentire yeast chromosome. This behavior isalsoconsistent with
atethering model. This work together with theFISH experiments inDrosophila
embryos, suggest apicture ofnuclear architecture inwhich chromosomes areheld in
precisely defined positions bybeing tethered toanimmobile internal structure. These
results have important functional consequences forprocesses such asmeiosis thatinvolve
large-scale chromosome motion.

xiiChapter 1.Chromosome Positioning andNuclear Architecture
Summary:
Recent advances influorescence insituhybridization and3Dmicroscopy have revealed a
high degree oflarge-scale order inthenucleus, inwhich theposition ofeach gene within the
nucleus isnolonger random. Like any other biological phenomenon, this large-scale
organization must ultimately bespecified bymolecular interactions. Biochemical andmolecular
investigations have revealed asmall setoflocal molecular-scale interactions thatcan beused
together inacombinatorial fashion toestablish aglobal large-scale nuclear architecture and
stabilize itagainst Brownian motion.
Introduction:
Since theearly days ofcytology, evidence thatinterphase chromatin isorganized inawell
defined architecture hasbeen slowly, butsteadily, accumulating (Comings, 1980). More
recently, theintroduction offluorescence insituhybridization (FISH) techniques thatminimally
perturb thestructure ofthenucleus hasallowed theposition ofspecific loci tobevisualized
within thenucleus. Byusing FISH incombination with three-dimensional microscopy, the
precise position ofaspecific locus within anucleus canbemeasured, andbycomparing many
nuclei, itcanbeseen thatparticular locireproducibly occupy different sub-regions inthenucleus
(Chug etal.,1990; Ellison andHoward, 1981; Hochstrasser etal.,1986; Hoefers etal.,1993;
Manuelidis andBorden, 1988; Nagele etal.,1995; vanDekken etal.,1990; Vourc’h etal.,1993;
Zalensky etal.,1995). Recent evidence indicates, infact, that alllocilikely occupy defined
positions (Marshall etal.,1996). Buthow could such large-scale organization besetup? In
addition torevealing overall positioning within thenucleus, FISH studies have suggested asetof
defined interactions (e.g. associations ofchromatin with thenuclear envelope) which provide the
basis fortheoverall order that isobserved. Understanding these interactions willbethekey to*

%manipulating nuclear architecture andthereby testing itsbiological role. Furthermore, these
individual interactions may inandofthemselves perform avariety offunctional roles. The
purpose ofthisreview istoshow how large-scale global nuclear order isbuilt upfrom asmall set
oflocal molecular interactions which thusconstitute theorganizing principles ofthenucleus.
We willconsider separately aseries oflocal molecular interactions andprocesses which can,
incombination, give risetotheobserved global arrangements ofinterphase chromatin. Each of
these organizing principles hasbeen directly demonstrated using FISH and3Dmicroscopy. For
each proposed mechanism, wewill define itinmolecular andphysical terms, discuss the
evidence supporting itsexistence, andbriefly discuss itspossible role inoverall nuclear
architecture. Webroadly group thelocal organizing principles into three classes: active
positioning, interactions between chromosomes, andinteractions ofchromosomes with other
structures. Foreach broad class, welisttheknown types ofinteractions andthen discuss in
detail oneparticular example.
Organizing Principle I:Active Positioning
The first organizing principle wewill consider isactive force applied locally toa
chromosome. Inseveral cases, itisknown thatchromosomes areactively moved intospecific
arrangements, thenecessary force being provided bythecytoskeleton. Forexample, during
anaphase, chromosomes aredrawn outintoparallel straight rods, and thisconformation has
profound consequences fornuclear organization inthesubsequent interphase. Another example
istheclustering oftelomeres during meiosis (Chikashe etal.,1994; Dernburg etal.,1995),
which appears toinvolve thecytoskeleton (Salonen etal.,1982). Finally, persistent directed
motion ofasubset ofcentromeres hasrecently been demonstrated during interphase inliving
HeLa cells (Shelby etal.,1996). This motion wastooregular anddirectional tobeexplained by
Brownian motion, andthus itmay reflect theaction ofnuclear motor proteins onchromatin. One
Suchmotor protein, thekinesin-like nodgene product, hasalready been shown tobeassociated
withchromosome arms during meiosis inDrosophila (Afshar etal.,1995). Other candidates for***sºElºfC.-,--

--->u-seemotor proteins inside thenucleus include actin/myosin (both actin andactin-like proteins are
found innuclei) (Milankov andDeBoni, 1993; Weber etal.,1995) andalso theSMC family of
ATPases (Hirano etal.,1995) which have been proposed toactasmotors inchromatin
condensation. Theability ofRNA polymerases toactasmotors tomove DNA hasrecently been
demonstrated (Yin etal.,1996). Active positioning ofchromatin bylocally applied forces may
thus turn outtobeawidespread phenomenon. Ofthese examples given here, theconsequences
ofanaphase forces remain thebestunderstood.
Attheendofanaphase, thechromosomes have been arranged asasetofparallel rods all
oriented similarly with centromeres atoneendandtelomeres attheother. This configuration is
maintained during interphase andcauses thenucleus tobepolarized, with centromeres clustering
atoneendofthenucleus, andtelomeres attheopposite end(Figure 1A). This anaphase remnant
isknown asthe“Rabl Configuration” (Comings, 1984). Ithasbeen observed inmany celltypes
including Drosophila [3,4,11,21,22](Ellison andHoward, 1981; Hochstrasser etal.,1986;
Marshall etal.,1996, Dernburg etal.,1996; FoeandAlberts, 1985), fission yeast (Funabiki et
al.,1993), plants (Fussell, 1987), andmammalian cells (Haaf andWard, 1995). The Rabl
configuration defines anaxis inthenucleus, running from oneendofthenucleus totheother. In
Drosophila embryos, notjustcentromeres andtelomeres, butalllociarearranged along thisaxis,
with theposition along theaxiscorresponding togenomic position. Thus, forces applied locally
atthekinetochore (bythespindle) lead toaglobal organization oftheentire nucleus (i.e. the
Rabl configuration).
What arethefunctional consequences oftheRabl configuration? This iscurrently the
simplest aspect ofnuclear architecture toaddress experimentally, since simple translocations can
beused toshift theposition ofarelevant locus onthechromosome, moving towards oraway
from thecentromere, andhence upordown relative totheRabl axis. Indication that such
manipulations canhave functional consequences isprovided bythephenomenon ofposition
effect variegation (PEV) inDrosophila, where genomic distance away from thecentromere hasa
profound effect ongene expression (Eissenberg, 1989). PEV occurs when ablock ofheterochromatin (which inDrosophila isusually restricted totheregion surrounding the
centromere) isplaced adjacent toaeuchromatic gene incis,causing thatgene toberepressed.
Rearrangements that move thisgene together with theflanking heterochromatic block farther
away onthechromosome from thecentromere (where most oftheheterochromatin is)lead toa
suppression ofPEV and arestoration ofgene expression. Onehypothesis isthatheterochromatin
near agene cancause that gene torelocate inthenucleus tospecial heterochromatic
compartment, thereby leading toitsrepression (Henikoff etal.,1995). Because inDrosophila
essentially alltheheterochromatin isfound flanking thecentromeres, thismodel implies thatthe
farther thegene isgenomically from thecentromere, thefarther itwill beaway from the
centromeric heterochromatin spatially along theRabl axis, andthus thegene will beless
repressed. Recent evidence suggests thatphysical proximity ofavariegating gene with the
centric heterochromatin may indeed correspond torepression ofthatgene, because notonly can
theheterochromatin responsible forPEV cause thevariegating gene tobecome associated with
thecentromeric heterochromatin (Dernburg etal.,1996; Csink andHenikoff, 1996), butthe
frequency ofthisassociation isreduced byrearrangements ormutations thatsuppress PEV
(Henikoff etal.,1995; Csink andHenikoff, 1996). Incases such asDrosophila where the
majority ofheterochromatin isclustered around thecentromeres, theRabl configuration
effectively partitions thenucleus intoheterochromatic andeuchromatic territories. Thus, highly
local forces exerted atasingle point onachromosome (thecentromere) endupinfluencing gene
expression allthroughout thegenome asaresult oftheir effects onglobal architecture.
Organizing Principle II:Interactions Between Chromosomes
Thesecond organizing principle wewilldiscuss isassociations between chromosomes. Such
interactions include somatic homolog pairing (seebelow), large-scale looping ofchromatin
(Dernburg etal.,1996; Rippe etal.,1995), andclustering ofboth centromeres andtelomeres
(Funabiki etal.,1993). Here wewillfocus onthepairing ofhomologous chromosomes.*.

*2'C]2.ºt2"C12:"….~12)*:2-
sº." *-Diploid organisms contain twocopies ofeach chromosome which canbearranged sothatthe
homologues areintimately associated with each other. This homologous chromosome pairing is
ofgreat importance formeiosis where homologues must synapse forproper chromosome
segregation inthefirstdivision. Pairing alsooccurs innon-meiotic tissues. This somatic pairing
hasbeen directly observed using FISH inDrosophila (Hiraoka etal.,1993) andhuman cells
(Arnoldus etal.,1989; LaSalle andLalande, 1996), where instead oftwodistinct hybridization
signals arising from thetwohomologs, only asingle FISH signal isseen, implying thatthetwo
homologs have become paired. Somatic pairing hasalso been implicated inseveral epigenetic
phenomena such astransvection (Wu, 1993), genetic imprinting (LaSalle andLalande, 1996) and
paramutation (Patterson etal.,1993), which seem todepend onthepairing state ofthe
homologous chromosomes. Inthese cases, gene expression ismodulated byproximity ofthe
twohomologues asevidenced bythefact thatchromosome rearrangements, which disrupt
homologue pairing, have acorresponding effect ongene expression. These phenomena taken
together suggest thathomologous pairing has arole ingene regulation.
This aspect ofnuclear organization seems highly regulated. The extent ofhomologous
pairing varies greatly between different organisms andeven among different tissues within one
organism (Arnoldus etal.,1989). Moreover, even inagiven cell, pairing isnonuniform along
thelength ofachromosome, with aspecific subset ofthegenes paired andothers unpaired
(Arnoldus etal.,1989). Loci closely linked toapairing sitewilltend tobecloser together than
loci notnear apairing site. Moreover, even afew sites ofhomolog pairing will cause
homologous chromosomes tobegenerally closer together than non-homologs. This results ina
second level ofnuclear architecture superimposed ontheRabl configuration, inwhich
homologous pairing atafewdiscrete sites determines thedistances between homologous and
nonhomologous loci(Figure 1B). Once again weseethatlocal interactions (homologous pairing
atdiscrete sites on achromosome) contribute toglobal architecture (distance between
chromosomes).º

s .*:23Organizing Principle III:Chromatin Interactions with Other Structures
Thethird organizing principle weconsider isbinding ofchromatin tolarge nuclear structures.
Wewould expect Brownian motion, given enough time, toreduce even themost orderly
chromosome configuration toatangled mess. That awell defined architecture isstillobserved
implies thatchromatin must somehow beanchored, soastoprevent itsrandomization. Such
anchoring requires alarge, relatively immobile superstructure, andseveral nuclear structures may
serve such afunction. Candidate structures would include both thenuclear envelope andthe
nuclear matrix/nucleoskeleton. Wewillfocus oninteractions with thenuclear envelope since
these areamong themost obvious interactions visible byFISH experiments.
Associations ofspecific chromosome loci with thenuclear envelope have been clearly
demonstrated ininterphase (Chung etal.,1990; Hochstrasser etal.,1986; Vourc’h etal.,1993;
Marshall etal.,1996). This association islikely duetolocal binding interactions between some
component ofthechromatin andsome component ofthenuclear envelope. Anumber ofsuch
potential interactions have been identified by invitro binding studies. Lamins (Glass etal.,
1993; Luderus etal.,1994; Taniura etal.,1995) andalsolamin-associated proteins (Foisner and
Gerace, 1993; YeandWorman, 1996) have been shown tobind mitotic chromosomes and in
some cases naked DNA (Glass etal.,1993; Luderus etal.,1994), histones (Taniura andGerace,
1995), orheterochromatin proteins (YeandWorman, 1996). Atleast onenuclear pore complex
subunit contains zinc finger motifs which may indicate anability tobind DNA (Sukegawa and
Blobel, 1993). These binding interactions result insome locibeing recruited totheNEwhile
others remain inthenuclear interior. Asaresult, aradial position coordinate isdefined, just asin
aspherical coordinate system, with theradial position ofeach locus relative totheNEdictated
byhow near thatlocus onthechromosome toanNEbinding site(Figure 1C). This represents a
third level ofnuclear organization superimposed ontheRabl configuration andhomolog pairing.
Themain point isthatonce again, highly local interactions (e.g. lamins binding tohistones or
DNA) give risetoalarge-scale global order (radial position) inthenucleus.c.
**What rolemight chromatin-NE interactions play ininterphase? There issome evidence to
suggest that transcribed sequences arepreferentially located near thenuclear periphery
(Hutchinson andWeintraub, 1985). Thegene-gating hypothesis (Blobel, 1985) proposes that
genes arerecruited totheNEtofacilitate export oftheir transcripts. This concept isparticularly
compelling inthecase oftheapically localized pair-rule transcripts inDrosophila, because the
strong Rabl configuration seen inthese nuclei provides anatural nuclear asymmetry thatcould
lead totheasymmetric localization ofthetranscripts. However, thenuclear localization ofthese
genes does notappear toreflect thelocalization ofthetranscript (Davis etal.,1993), arguing
against arole fornuclear positioning indirecting transcript export orlocalization Itisalso
possible thattargeting specific genes totheNEcould facilitate their interaction with other NE
components besides thenuclear pores. Chromatin-NE interactions may also play arole in
chromosome condensation, ascondensation hasbeen observed toinitiate near thenuclear
envelope inDrosophila embryos (Hiraoka etal.,1989). This may beanadaptation tofacilitate
therapid segregation ofchromosomes that must take place inthese embryos: bycausing
separate chromosomes tocondense onto different regions ofthenuclear envelope, chromosomes
canbedisentangled andseparated prior totheonset ofanaphase itself.
Combinatorial Specification ofNuclear Position
Direct measurement ofthenuclear position ofalarge number ofsites indicates that allloci
arelikely confined tospecific positions inthenucleus, theposition ofagiven locus varying from
theaverage position byonly +0.5 pumfrom cell tocell(Marshall etal.,1996). While none ofthe
individual local interactions delineated above would besufficient togive such precisely defined
positioning, several ofthese interactions, working incombination, cangive thelocalization that
isobserved. Asaresult oftheanaphase forces, theposition ofagiven site isspecified along the
Rabl axis, thus placing thatsite inaplane through thenucleus. However, itcould beanywhere
inthisplane since theRabl configuration only determines position along asingle axis. However,
interactions with thenuclear envelope, other chromosomes, andother nuclear structures, will**
**determine where within thisplane thesiteresides. Together these constraints lead toahighly
Specified position. Forexample, agene located near acentromere andclose toanNEbinding
site will have amuch different location inthenucleus from agene located inthemiddle ofa
chromosome armandfarfrom anyNEbinding sites (theformer will beonthenuclear periphery
atoneendofthenucleus, while theother will lieinthecentral region ofthenucleus).
From thispoint ofview, each type ofinteraction ororganizing principle discussed above
becomes, ineffect, aseparate degree offreedom. Because localization isacombinatorial
function ofthese degrees offreedom, itshould bepossible tochange oneindependently ofthe
others, with predictable effects onnuclear organization. This isindeed true. Ifweuse a
rearrangement toshift asitetoadifferent position onthechromosome, theRabl axisposition
should shift without affecting thedistance totheNE. This isindeed thecase (Marshall etal.,
1996). Likewise, ifanNEassociation site isinserted near agiven locus, thedistance ofthat
locus totheNEshould decrease without affecting itsposition along theRabl axis. This toohas
been experimentally demonstrated (Dernburg etal.,1996). Such manipulations finally provide
means oftesting thefunctional relevance ofnuclear organization.
The factthatdifferent locihave different localizations inthenucleus may tosome extent
explain theobservation that when thepositions ofentire chromosomes inthenucleus are
determined, itisfound thatdifferent chromosomes occupy different territories within thenucleus
(Hochstrasser etal.,1986; Cremer etal.,1993; Eils etal.,1996). Because thedifferent loci
composing each chromosome will betargeted todifferent regions ofthenucleus bythelocal
interactions described inthisreview, itfollows that thechromosomes themselves must likewise
occupy different nuclear regions.
Conclusions andFuture Developments
Asourunderstanding ofthemolecular basis ofnuclear organization improves, sotoowillour
ability totestthevarious hypothetical functions ofnuclear architecture. Donuclear envelope
interactions facilitate export and localization ofspecific transcripts (Blobel, 1985) orW.

Because there areseveral well characterized genetic phenomena inDrosophila thatappear to
involve nuclear architecture, including transvection andposition effect variegation, andbecause
alarge number ofchromosome rearrangements andmutations exist which modify these
phenomena, weanticipate thatDrosophila willcontinue toplay apivotal role inelucidating the
functional roles ofnuclear architecture. Theincreasingly widespread useofthree dimensional
microscopy willfurther contribute torapid progress inthisarea.Local Global

17Chapter 2.Specific Interactions ofChromatin with theNuclear Envelope:
Positional Determination within theNucleus inD.melanogaster
SUMMARY
Specific interactions ofchromatin with thenuclear envelope (NE) inearly embryos of
Drosophila melanogaster have been mapped andanalyzed. Astatistical method todetect
sites nonrandomly associated with theNEwasdeveloped based onuseofasurface
harmonic expansion tomodel thenuclear surface. Using fluorescence insituhybridization,
thethree-dimensional positions of42DNA probes, primarily tochromosome 2L,have
been mapped innuclei ofintact Drosophila embryos, revealing 5euchromatic and 2
heterochromatic regions associated with the NE. These results predict thatthere are
approximately 15NEcontacts perchromosome arm, which delimit large chromatin loops
ofapproximately 1-2Mb. These NEassociation sites donotstrictly correlate with
scaffold-attachment regions (SARs), heterochromatin, orbinding sites ofknown chromatin
proteins. Pairs ofneighboring probes surrounding oneNEassociation sitewere used to
delimit theNEassociation sitemore precisely, suggesting thatperipheral localization ofa
large stretch ofchromatin islikely toresult from NEassociation atasingle discrete site.
These NEinteractions arenotestablished until after telophase, bywhich time thenuclear
envelope hasreassembled around thechromosomes, andthey arethus unlikely tobe
involved inbinding ofNEvesicles tochromosomes following mitosis. Analysis of
positions ofthese probes alsoreveals thattheinterphase nucleus isstrongly polarized ina
Rabl configuration which, together with specific targeting totheNEortothenuclear
interior, results ineach locus occupying ahighly determined position within thenucleus.**

18INTRODUCTION
Studies ofnuclear organization suggest thattheeukaryotic nucleus isnotsimply abag
ofDNA butrather ahighly structured organelle. Forexample, individual chromosomes
andchromosome domains occupy well-defined territories within thenucleus, and inmany
cases thechromosomes assume characteristic configurations orpositions (Comings, 1980,
Mathog etal.1984, Hilliker andAppels 1989, Cremer etal.1993, Spector 1993). If
chromatin wasunconstrained andfree todiffuse atrandom, such nuclear organization
could not bemaintained. Indeed, direct measurement ofchromosome diffusion has
revealed thatthisdiffusion isindeed constrained (seeChapter 3).This constraint, andthe
corresponding persistence ofadefined arrangement ofchromosomes within thenucleus is
thus likely torequire interactions between chromosome domains andsome other nuclear
component which would serve asascaffold oranchor. Themost visibly obvious structure
towhich chromosomes can beanchored isthenuclear envelope, andchromatin-NE
interactions arethus likely toplay amajor role innuclear organization.
Associations between chromatin andthenuclear envelope (NE) have been observed
cytologically formany years (DuPraw, 1965, Murray andDavies, 1979, Quick, 1980,
Hochstrasser etal.,1986, Loidl, 1990, Paddy etal.,1990, Belmont etal.,1993). Ithas
been proposed that these chromatin-NE interactions may play arole inavariety of
processes, including organization oftheinterphase nucleus (Comings, 1980), gene
regulation (Hutchison andWeintraub, 1985, Blobel, 1985, Palladino etal.1993),
chromatin condensation (Hiraoka, 1989), nuclear reassembly (reviewed inWiese and
Wilson, 1993), andmeiotic homolog pairing (reviewed inLoidl, 1990). However with the
exception ofmeiotic telomeres (Loidl, 1990, Dernburg etal.,1995), itisnotknown which
lociinteract with theNE,particularly during interphase. Indeed, itisnotknown forcertain
iftheinterphase chromatin-NE contacts observed inthemicroscope involve NE-binding by
specific chromosomal loci, ageneral association ofchromatin with theNE, ormerely*>zi

19coincidental contact. Ifchromatin-NE interactions aresite-specific, then aknowledge of
precisely which sites associate with theNEininterphase could shed light ontheroleof
such interactions inthenucleus, byallowing changes inNEassociation tobecorrelated
with changes intranscriptional activity, DNA repliocation, etc. Inaddition, amap ofNE
associated sites would facilitate identification ofthemolecular determinants ofthe
interaction, andprovide abasis forcomparing cell-cycle dependent ordevelopmental
changes inNEassociation. Furthermore, such amap ofNEinteractions would allow
manipulation, viachromosome rearrangements, ofthepattern ofNEcontacts totestfor
possible functions.
Onepossible way tofindNE-binding sites istoisolate DNA thatbinds tothenuclear
scaffold ormatrix. Thenuclear scaffold isoperationally defined astheinsoluble fraction
resulting from extraction ofisolated nuclei toremove most ofthechromatin (Berezney and
Coffey, 1974). Specific DNA sequences, called scaffold attachment regions (SARs)
coprecipitate with thescaffold after restriction endonuclease digestions, andbind the
nuclear scaffold invitro (Gasser andLaemmli, 1986). Because lamins aremajor
components ofnuclear scaffolds (Lebkowski andLaemmli, 1982), and inlight ofclaims
that aDrosophila SAR canbind directly tonuclear lamins (Luderus etal.,1992), itis
possible thatsome SARs may bind theNEinvivo. However, Drosophila SARs have been
shown byothers tobind invitro totheinternal rather than theperipheral lamin-enriched
component ofthescaffold (Izaurralde etal.,1988). Thebinding ofSARs tothenuclear
envelope isthus acontroversial question. Moreover, therelevance ofthevarious nuclear
scaffold preparations toactual nuclear structures invivo isitself amatter ofsome
controversy (Jackson etal.,1990).
Inaddition toSAR preparations, invitro binding studies using defined components
have identified proteins thatmay beinvolved inchromatin-NE interactions, including both
nuclear lamins (along with associated proteins) andnuclear pores (Sukegawa andBlobel,
1993, Luderus etal., 1994, Glass and Gerace, 1990, Glass etal., 1993, Foisner andI}

asia"
20Gerace, 1993, Worman etal.,1990, Yuan etal.1991). However, without knowing which
chromosomal lociinteract with theNEinintact nuclei, these results may bedifficult to
interpret. Ingeneral, thepropensity ofproteins toadhere toeach other andespecially to
chromatin, which contains many strongly charged repeated moieties such asDNA (inthis
regard, nonspecific DNA binding assays, andbyextension chromatin binding assays, are
tosome extent exercises inionexchange chromatography), makes itsomewhat dangerous
toconclude abiological interaction from aninvitro binding experiment intheabsence ofa
functional assay. Moreover, itisalways difficult toreproduce invitro theexact conditions
inside acell. Chromatin, inparticular, isknown tobeexquisitly sensitive tobuffer
conditions. Therefore, formany reaons, analternative method fordetecting chromatin-NE
interactions inintact cells would beauseful complement toinvitro binding experiments.
One such alternative approach istousemicroscopy tovisualize thelocalization of
specific chromosomal lociwith respect totheNE. Inaddition tocircumventing some ofthe
difficulties inherent instrictly biochemical approaches, visualization ofchromatin-NE
interactions inthecontext oftheintact nucleus will allow further investigations ofthe
relations between these sites andother nuclear structures, such aslamin fibers (Belmont et
al.,1993), thenucleolus (Manuelidis andBorden, 1988, Billia and DeBoni, 1991), or
focioftranscription andreplication (Spector, 1993, Hassan etal.,1994). Furthermore, a
microscopic approach isextremely fast and convenient, and isreadily applied toawide
variety oftissues, andeven tomultiple celltypes within asingle tissue, facilitating an
analysis ofdevelopmental, cell-cycle, ortissue specific changes inthepattern ofNE
COntaCt.
Several groups have employed three-dimensional microscopy toaskwhether ornot
particular genomic locilocalize tothenuclear envelope ininterphase nuclei. Itisnot
sufficient merely toexamine images andvisually observe peripheral localization, because
within asphere, themajority ofrandomly localized points will fallnear theperiphery.
Therefore, itisnecessary todemonstrate thatperipheral localization issignificantly greater
21than thatexpected atrandom. One method istoshow thatsome loci lie on thenuclear
surface more often than others (Manuelidis andBorden, 1988). Other groups have carried
outastatistical analysis employing atheoretical model forthedistribution ofpoints within a
nucleus, which iscomputed either analytically (Chung etal.,1990, Ferguson andWard,
1992, Vourc'h etal.1993) orusing aMonte Carlo method (Van Dekken etal.,1990,
Hoefers etal.,1993). Using these methods, localization ofcentromeres andtelomeres
with respect totheNE has been analyzed, buttheNEassociation ofeuchromatic loci in
general hasnotbeen specifically addressed.
Inthisreport, wedescribe alight-microscopy based assay forNEassociation to
identify interactions between specific lociandthenuclear envelope incycle 13Drosophila
embryos. This method hasbeen applied tomap theposition ofaseries ofprobes inthe
euchromatin ofchromosome 2aswell asanumber ofheterochromatic satellite sequences,
revealing anumber ofspecific NEcontacts. Comparison oftheNEcontact sites with
known SARS (Gasser andLaemmli, 1986), boundary elements (Udvardy etal.,1985),
andintercalary heterochromatin (Zhimulev etal.,1982) suggests thatNEassociation may
involve anovel type ofDNA element. Remarkably, these data also reveal strong
positioning ofdifferent lociwithin theinterphase nucleus.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Preparation ofgenomic FISH probes
Ourmapping effort takes advantage ofalibrary ofgenomic clones currently employed
bytheBerkeley Drosophila Genome Project fortheir large scale mapping andsequencing
ofwhole Drosophila chromosomes. Bacteria containing specific P1genomic clones were
provided byGerald Rubin. These P1clones originated from alibrary developed byHartl
andcoworkers (Hartlet al.,1994) who mapped thegenomic location ofmany oftheclonesgºtº
assº
gº
22byhybridization topolytene chromosomes. Allclones used intheexperiments described
here were previously mapped onpolytene chromosomes byHartlet al.Only P1sthatwere
reported togive asingle hybridization signal inthegenome onpolytene squashes (Hartlet
al.,1994) were used. Each P1contains approximately 80kb ofDrosophila genomic DNA.
Use ofDNA spanning such alarge region hasproven tobeessential forobtaining high
signal-to-noise ratios intheFISH procedure. 2mL LB-Kan medium were inoculated with 2
pullofanovernight culture ofP1-containing bacteria andgrown for3hours at37°C.Then
2pullof1MIPTG wasadded andtheculture grown another 3hrsbefore harvesting cells.
P1DNA wasobtained byalkaline lysis miniprep from 1mlofthisculture (Sambrook et
al.,1989), andamplified using degenerate oligonucleotide primed PCR (Telenius etal.,
1992). Amplification byDOP-PCR wasnecessary because theyield ofDNA from aP1
prep isgenerally lowduetothelowcopy number oftheP1plasmid. Probe DNA wasthen
digested with 4-base cutting restriction enzymes andend-labeled with rhodamine-4-d'OTP
(FluoroRed, Amersham Corp., Arlington Heights, IL)using terminal transferase (Ratliff
Biochemical, NM). Direct labelling using fluorescent nucleotide wasfound toproduce a
cleaner FISH signal than when using nucleotides labelled with biotin ordigoxygenin.
While useofdirect label didnotnecessarily reduce theintensity ofthebackground staining,
thebackground appeared much smoother andlesspunctate, making iteasier todistinguish
thetrue hybridization signal from spurious background intensity. Fordouble-label
experiments, oneprobe waslabeled with rhodamine-4-duTP (FluoroRed) andtheother
with fluorescein-d'OTP (FluoroGreen, Amersham Corp.) Probes were checked by
hybridization topolytene chromosome squashes toverify detection ofthecorrect locus.
Some P1s, approximately 10% ofthose tested, hybridized tomore than onesite inthe
genome inpolytene squashes. Presumably thiswasdue toregions oflimited homology or
else tothepresence ofmiddle-repetitive repeat DNA. These P1probes were notused in
embryos. Probes specific forheterochromatic repeats were made directly from cloned
Satellite DNA orsynthetic oligonucleotides, using thesame labeling procedure. The Rspassº

Fixation, hybridization, and staining.
Drosophila embryos (Oregon-R) collected from population cages were bleach
dechorionated andfixed in3.7% formaldehyde asdescribed in(Paddy etal.,1990).
Approximately 40pilpacked volume ofembryos were then placed in500mleppendorf
tubes forallsubsequent steps. Insituhybridization was then carried outusing a
modification ofapublished method thatpreserves thestructural integrity oftheembryos
andchromosomes (Hiraoka etal.,1993). Pretreatment ofembryos with RNase hasno
effect ontheresulting images indicating thatFISH signals represent hybridization toDNA
(Hiraoka etal1993). Following hybridization, embryos were washed four times in
2xSSCT (0.3M NaCl 0.03M Na3citrate 0.1% Tween-20). Allsubsequent steps were
carried outatroom temperature. Immunofluorescence wascarried outonhybridized
embryos with antiDrosophila lamin monoclonal T40 (Paddy etal.,1990) asfollows.
Embryos were blocked byincubating with 6mg/ml normal goat serum (Jackson
Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) in2xSSCT forfour hours onarotating
plate mixer. Goat serum wasfound toproduce lessbackground than BSA. Embryos were
then washed three times in2xSSCT. Embryos were then incubated overnight with T40
ascites fluid diluted 1:40 in2xSSCT andthen washed three times in2xSSCT for10min, 1
hr,and 1.5hrs. Next, embryos were incubated for4hours with fluorescein conjugated
goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West
Grove, PA) at7plg/ml in2xSSCT. Fordouble-label experiments inwhich FISH probes
were labeled with rhodamine andfluorescein, Cy-5 conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary
antibodies were employed (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). After incubation with
secondary antibodies, embryos were washed twice quickly in2xSSCT, then once for3
hours, andthen washed overnight. Embryos were then stained with 0.5pig■mlDAPI, a
24DNA specific stain, in2xSSCT for10min. Finally embryos were washed twice in50mM
TRIS-Cl pH8.0andpipetted onto aglass slide between two#0coverslip spacers. Useof
spacers wasessential, asitwasfound that intheabsence ofspacers, nuclei onthetop
surface oftheembryo (thesurface thatwasimaged) were deformed bythepressure ofthe
coverslip which notonly changed theshape ofthenuclei making anyresults obtained less
trustworthy, butalso thisdeformation caused thenuclear envelope tobecome lessclearly
visible incertain parts ofthenucleus. Buffer wasaspirated away, andembryos were
overlaid with antifade mounting medium (Vectashield, Vector Laboratories Inc.Burlingame
CA). A#1.5 coverslip wasthen placed over theembryos andsealed with clear nailpolish.
Inorder toensure that allembryos analyzed were atthesame developmental stage, only
embryos ininterphase ofthe13thembryonic division cycle (asjudged bynumber ofnuclei
perfield ofview) were imaged. DAPI imaging wasused toensure thatonly interphase
nuclei were imaged. Foranalysis oftelophase nuclei, telophase wasdistinguished by
several features. First, inDAPI, thenuclei appeared small, smooth, andfeatureless,
distinct from either anaphase when theindividual chromosome arms can beseen, or
interphase where thenuclei arerelatively larger andthechromatin staining isnotuniform.
Second, lamin immunofluorescence intelophase isquite distinctive, with thenuclei
appearing elongated intheplane oftheembryo surface, arranged inoppositely oriented
pairs, andwith aclear spot ofnon-nuclear lamin staining atthespindle midbody. Nuclei
satisfying allthese criteria were chosen astelophase nuclei.
Three-Dimensional Wide-field Fluorescence Microscopy
Data collection was carried outusing multiwavelength wide-field 3Dmicroscopy
(Hiraoka etal.,1991) inwhich ascientific grade cooled CCD camera isused toacquire
images, and inwhich allshutters, filter wheels, stage motion, andimage acquisition are
under computer control. Embryos were imaged using a60x 1.4N.A. lens(Olympus Inc.)
andn=1.5180 immersion oil(R.P. Cargille Laboratories Inc., Cedar Grove NJ). Three
25dimensional datasets, each containing 40-60 nuclei, were acquired bymoving thestage in
0.5pumintervals. Under these conditions, thepixel size is0.1117x0.1117 pum intheXY
plane and0.5pumintheZaxis. Ateach focus position, animage wasacquired ateach of
three wavelengths (605 nm,540 nm,460 nm)corresponding tothethree fluorophores
used (rhodamine, fluorescein, andDAPI). Outoffocus light wasremoved byconstrained
iterative deconvolution using anexperimentally determined point-spread function (Agard et
al.,1989). Use ofdeconvolution-wdiefield microscopy has amajor advantage over
confocal microscopy forsuch experiments inthatthephoton collection efficiency isvery
high, sothat forequivalant ammounts ofphotobleaching, amuch greater number of
photons (byatleast anorder ofmagnitude) canbeimaged, thus improving thesignal to
noise ratio. Forthedetection ofsmall, somewhat dimFISH signals, ahigh signal tonoise
ratio isessential. Examples ofsuch images aregiven inFigure 1.NEassociation ofthe
FISH signals were analyzed based onthese images, using thefollowing procedure, which
issummarized inFigure 2.
Interactive location ofFISH signals
Aninteractive 3Dvisualization package (Chen etal.,1995) wasused tointeractively
pick the3Dlocation ofFISH signals (Figure 2A). When picking FISH spots, some
hybridization signals areseen toconsist oftwoclosely adjacent smaller spots, inwhich
case theapproximate center ofmass ofboth smaller spots taken together ischosen forthe
location ofthesignal. Once theapproximate location ofaFISH spot isinteractively
picked, theintensity-weighted center ofmass isfound ina5x5x3 pixel region centered on
themanually chosen point. This refined FISH spot location isused forallsubsequent
analysis. Byusing theintensity-weighted center ofmass, weareable tomeasure the
position ofthecenter oftheFISH spot toaprecision exceeding theresolution limit ofthe
microscope. This type ofanalysis isthebasis ofsingle-particle tracking experiments and is
nowcommonly employed tostudy nanometer scale displacements ofindividual molecules.
26Both thisfitting procedure, andtheprocedure used tofitthenuclear surface, takeadvantage
ofaveraging data from several pixels toobtain amore precise measure oftheposition ofthe
spot orthesurface. Because theprecision ofsuch measurements isindependent ofthe
resolution, depending only onthesignal tonoise ratio ofthesignals, optical resolution
does not, place anabsolute limit onourability todetect NEassociations. Wenote

27cylinder arechosen interactively foreach dataset tobestmatch theradius andheight ofthe
nuclei (Figure 2B).
Once asetofpoints hasbeen assigned toeach nucleus, asurface isfittothissetof
points (Figure 2C). Weemploy asurface harmonic expansion torepresent thesurface
(Purcell etal.,1991). This representation issimple tocalculate, canrepresent awide
variety ofnuclear shapes, and can befitted toasetofpoints ofarbitrary number,
placement, andordering. The surface harmonic expansion describes thesurface in
spherical coordinates andtakes theform:
N P1
r(0,0) =XIanPn(cos() +X(anmcosmotbnmsinmo)P. (cos)] (1)
n=0 m= 1
171- - - - -- - -where P.areLegendre polynomials, andristheradial distance from theorigin tothe
surface attheangles 0and ().Fornuclei ofDrosophila embryos, only terms uptoN=4 are
included intheexpansion.
The surface for anucleus isfound byleast-squares fitting thesurface harmonic
expansion tothesetofNEpoints assigned tothatnucleus. Thecentroid (x0,y0, z0)ofthe
setofNEpoints iscalculated and isused todefine theorigin ofthespherical coordinate
system forthatnucleus. Next, asetofequations issetup,oneforeach point tobefit.
These areoftheform:
ri=r(0i,(pi) (2)
Theunknown parameters tobeestimated arean,anm, andbmm ,thecoefficients ofthe
surface harmonic expansion, which determine thefunction r(),andhence theshape ofthe
28nucleus, byequation (1).Theposition ofeach point (xi,yi,zi)towhich thesurface will
befitted isconverted intospherical coordinates (ri,61,0i). Given Npsuch points tofit,we
seek thecoefficients thatminimize thequantity:
*=N;:[ri-r(91.0i)]? (3) 1E
This linear least squares problem issolved using asingular-value decomposition
routine (NAG FORTRAN Library Mark 15,NAG Inc., Downers Grove, IL). As
illustrated inFigure 3,thesurface generated bythissurface harmonic fitting matches the
NEshape quite well, andsmoothly spans gaps inthelamin signal. When theresidual
fitting error edefined byequation (3)isaveraged for256nuclei taken from fiverandomly
chosen datasets, theaverage fitting error £is0.28 pum. Because thelamin inthese images
isapproximately 0.5pumthick (seebelow), andbecause points throughout thisthick lamin
image areused tofitthesurface, weexpect aresidual fitting error ontheorder ofhalfthe
thickness ofthelamin image, or0.25 pum,which isclose towhat isobserved. Although a
deviation inthesurface of0.28 pumwillhave some effect onthemeasured distances tothe
NE,these effects will becomparable (and tosome extent dueto)theuncertainty ofwhere
theactual surface ofthenuclear envelope iswithin thelamin image.
Tocompute thedistance ofaFISH signal tothesurface, theposition (rfish,0fish,0fish)
ofthemanually chosen FISH spot isfirstdetermined inspherical coordinates. Theradial
distance from theFISH spot tothesurface isthengiven by
dr=r(6fish, Öfish) -r■ish (4)
Monte Carlo Analysisº
29Totestfornonrandom association ofaFISH signal with theNE, asetofrandomly
distributed points isgenerated within each individual nucleus (Figure 2D). Thesurface
defined byequation (1)isused todefine avolume within which togenerate points. We
compensate fortheeffect oftheRabl orientation bygenerating random points whose
positions aredistributed inthezaxis with thesame distribution astheobserved FISH
signals. Todetermine thedistribution ofzpositions duetotheRabl orientation, thevertical
offset between each FISH spot andthecenter ofthenucleus ismeasured. Thesample
average andvariance ofthese vertical offsets arecomputed. Then randomly localized
points aregenerated inasystem ofCartesian coordinates with origin atthecenter ofthe
nucleus. The z(vertical) position ofeach point isaGaussian-distributed random variable
generated bytheBox-Muller normal approximation (Press etal.,1989) with mean and
variance equal tothesample mean andvariance inthevertical position oftheobserved
FISH spots relative toz0.The xand ypositions areuniform random variables with range #:
rcut(defined above). Foreach point thusgenerated, theradial distance drtothesurface as
defined byequation (4)iscomputed. Ifdré0, therandomly generated point would lie
outside thesurface and isnottobeconsidered, sothatpoint isdiscarded and anewpoint
isgenerated, thisprocess being repeated until apoint inside thesurface isgenerated. For
telophase nuclei, inwhich thenuclei arenotalloriented thesame way, FISH using a
dodecasatellite probe wasused todetect thecentromeric region. Avector from thecenter of
thenucleus tothecenter ofthedodecasatellite signal wastaken astheorientation ofthat
nucleus. This vector was then used instead ofthe zaxis todefine thevertical axis forthat
nucleus, andallcalculations ofmean vertical position andrandom point generation were
carried out inthis frame ofreference.
The setofrandom points isused todetermine ifagiven FISH spot isunusually close to
theNE. Wedefine “close” asfollows. For agiven FISH spot, theabove procedure is
used togenerate 5000 random points within thenucleus. These points aredivided intotwo
sets; those thatarecloser totheNEthan theobserved FISH spot(Sclose), andthose that
30arefarther from theNE(Sfar). Tocompensate fornonuniform distribution ofbulk
chromatin within thenucleus (Chung etal.,1990), theDAPI intensity ateach point ineach
Setissummed (yielding thesums Dclose andDfar, respectively). Aratio isthencomputed
Dclose
p=Dclose +Dfar (5)
Note that prepresents thefraction ofchromatin that iscloser totheNEthan the
observed FISH signal. Ifp<0.5then theFISH spot isdeclared “peripheral”, since less
than halfofthechromatin iscloser totheNEthan theFISH spot. Ifp>0.5 theFISH spot
isclassified asbeing “internal” from theNE, since more than half ofthechromatin is
closer. Bythisdefinition, without interaction with theNE, arandom locus should be
classified as“peripheral” approximately 50% ofthetime. Therefore atest isnecessary to
determine ifinalarge population ofFISH points, thefrequency ofperipheral points is
significantly greater than 50% (figure 2E).Note thatclassification ofpoints asperipheral if
they arecloser totheNEthan 50% ofchromatin isarbitrary. Asdiscussed below, if
peripheral isredefined toinclude only those FISH spots closer totheNEthan 80% of
chromatin, theresults oftheanalysis fortheprobes examined here isessentially thesame.
Thereason thatthechoice ofpercentile fordefining peripheral isnotcritical isthatthe
statistical testtakes thisvalue intoaccount, andsimply looks fordeviations from the
expected frequency ofapoint being “peripheral”. Attachment totheNEinsome fraction of
nuclei willcause anonrandomly large number ofFISH signals tobelocated near the
periphery andwillthusproduce adeviation inthefrequency ofperipheral spots nomatter
what percent ofchromatin ischosen forthedefinition. Wenote that thetest isbased on
looking forsubtle deviations indistribution, rather than simply scoring thefrequency of
actual NEcontact, inorder toincrease thesensitivity ofthesearch: FISH probes
hybridizing toregions near, but not actually containing, anNEbinding sitewillprobably
~
31notbelocalized exactly ontheNE, buttheir distribution will still bebiased toamore
peripheral distribution.
Letthere beatotal ofnFISH spots, outofwhich careclassified as“peripheral”, and
lettheexpected frequency ofperipheral spots under thehypothesis thatthelocus isnot
interacting with theNE,andhence isdistributed thesame asarandomly chosen point, be
p,where p=0.5 according totheabove definition (note that, asnoted above, other values
fortheexpected frequency pcanbeused, inwhich case adifferent pwould betaken asthe
cutoff forthedefinition ofperipheral). The nullhypothesis wewish totest isthat the
frequency ofperipheral points isthesame asthatpredicted forrandom points. Weseek a
critical value k”which isthemaximum number of"peripheral" spots thatweexpect ifthe
locus isinfactrandomly localized with respect totheNE. Then ifc>k” wewould reject
thehypothesis ofrandomness. For asignificance level ofO.thecritical value k"canbe
expressed as:
k"=np+0.5 +Z1-ownpd (6)
where Z1-0, isthe1-0-percentile ofthestandard normal, andq=1-p. Equation (6)is
thestandard method forcomparison ofanobserved frequency with anexpected frequency
given byp(Papoulis, 1990). Thecritical value isdetermined bychoosing O.=0.001.
Thus, ifforagiven FISH probe, more than k"outofnspots areclassified as“peripheral”
wereject thehypothesis ofrandomness with P-30.001, andconclude thatthelocus in
question isassociated with thenuclear envelope. Loci forwhich thehypothesis of
randomness hasbeen rejected willhenceforth bereferred toas“close”.
Ifweconsider thefraction ofpoints classified as"internal" relative totheNE, itis
possible toformulate asimilar testtodetect locithatarenonrandomly targeted tothenuclear
interior. Inthiscase, thesame statistical testapplies, except that inthiscase ifmore than
k*outofnspots are"internal", weconclude anonrandomly interior localization. Such'a--

32regions willhenceforth bereferred toas“far” from theNE. Loci which areclassified as
neither “close” nor“far” will beclassified as“random”, because their localization cannot be
distinguished from thatofarandom point bythistest. Wenote thatalthough arelatively
stringent value of0(0.001) wasused inthetest, forthelociclassified asrandom inTable
1,thenullhypothesis ofrandomness could notberejected even when setting 0–0.01, a
much lessstringent test. Thus, thediscrepancy between close andrandom lociwasquite
large andthedanger offalse positives issmall. Asatestoftheself-consistency ofthe
algorithm, weused therandom-point generation scheme outlined above togenerate, ineach
nucleus ofanactual dataset, one ortwopoint (depending onthenumber ofFISH spots
observed intheactual data). Inorder tobias thechoice ofrandom points according tothe
DAPI intensity distribution, initially 1000 points were generated foreach nucleus andtheir
positions, along with theDAPI intensity atthatposition, stored asrecords inanarray. A
random number Xwasthengenerated between 0andthetotal sum oftheDAPI intensities
forall1000 points. The array ofpoints was then traversed inorder, and ateach new
element inthearray theDAPI intensity was added toarunning sum. When thissum
exceeded therandom value X,thatelement ofthearray wasthen chosen. Inthisway, the
chance that aparticular element ofthearray would bechosen wasproportional totheDAPI
intensity atthatpoint. These random points were then fedback intotheMonte Carlo test
routine, andthetestperformed. For adataset of49FISH spots, thisprocedure wascarried
outfivetimes using adifferent initialization oftherandom number generator foreach run.
Theresults were anumber cofperipheral spots of17,26,24,22.26 outof49. Innocase
were these number significantly different from random. Bycontrast, theactual FISH data
showed ahighly significant association with theNE. Thus thealgorithm isconsistent in
thatrandom points generated artificially areindeed classified asrandom.
Asmentioned above, theresults presented here donotdepend onthechoice ofp.If
p=0.2 isused instead, theresult isessentially thesame, with theexception thatDS00178,
DS00277, DS05247, andDS07049, which areclassified asclose when p=0.5, are
33classified asrandom when p=0.2. Note thatofthese foursites, only oneshowed ahighly
significant (0–0.001) association with theNE, andthisresult only affects theapparent
extent oftheNEassociated regions, nottheir number orlocation. Finally, wereiterate that
thistest isdesigned todetect sites whose localization isbiased towards theNE. This
should include sites near butnotactually including anNEbinding site. The testwas
designed inthisway inorder toallow mapping ofNEassociation sites using coarsely
spaced probes, sothat alarge region ofachromosome canbecovered without having to
useacontiguous setofprobes, andstilldetect most ifnotallNEassociation sites. Forthis
reason, however, weshould expect thatmany locitested willshow aperipheral bias in
their localization, without actually touching theNEinthemajority ofnuclei.
Analysis ofdouble-label experiments
Embryos labeled with twodifferent probes intwodifferent colors were analyzed to
determine which probe ofthepairwascloser totheNE. Nuclear surfaces were represented
asabove, anddistances measured using equation (4). Only pairs ofFISH spots forwhich
oneorboth spots were within 0.3pumoftheNEwere used foranalysis. Distances tothe
NEwere compared between thetwoadjacent spots. When tabulating Table 2.3,pairs of
spots forwhich thedifference between thetwodistances islessthan 0.1pumwere counted
asbeing equidistant from theNE, sothatonly relatively major differences indistance were
counted when determining which spot iscloser.

39RESULTS
Strategy for detecting NEassociation
Anovel statistical testforNEassociation hasbeen developed inwhich thepositions of
specific lociaredetermined byfluorescence insituhybridization (FISH) followed byanti
lamin immunofluorescence tovisualize theNE(seeFigure 1forexamples). TheDNA in
situhybridization method employed here hasbeen carefully optimized topreserve large
scale chromosome structure, based onanumber ofcriteria including direct comparison
with livechromosome structure (Hiraoka etal.1993). Following three-dimensional data
collection using wide-field fluorescence microscopy, theimages areanalyzed using the
procedure summarized inFigure 2.Nuclei andFISH signals arelocated within theimage
and the nuclear surfaces arecomputationally modeled using theanti-lamin
immunofluorescence image data(Figure 3). Alarge number ofrandomly localized points
arethen generated within thenucleus, andthedistribution ofdistances from each point to
thesurface iscomputed. This distribution isthen compared with theobserved distances to
thesurface todetermine ifthelocus isnonrandomly associated with theNE. This statistical
analysis, described inMaterials andMethods, isunique inthat ittakes intoaccount the
effects ofvariation innuclear shape, large-scale chromosome organization, andnonuniform
distribution ofbulk chromatin, thus representing asignificant advance over previous
statistical techniques fordetecting NEassociation (van Dekken etal.,1990, Hoefers etal.,
1993). The large variations innuclear shape such asweobserve inDrosophila embryos
canresult insignificantly altered distributions ofpoints within thenuclei, indicating that it
isessential toexplicitly model nuclear shape asdone here, andnotmerely assume thatall
nuclei arespheres orellipsoids. Loci which areNEassociated willhenceforth bereferred
toas"close". Loci forwhich anNEassociation isnotapparent fallintotwoclasses. One
class islocalized nonrandomly tothenuclear interior (which will bereferred toas"far")
40andtheother has adistribution matching that ofarandom point, and ishence termed
"random". Formal definitions of"close", "random", and"far" aregiven inMaterials and
Methods.
Detection ofspecific chromatin-NE interactions
Theprocedure described above hasbeen applied toanumber ofloci, primarily on
chromosome arm 2L,with results listed inTable 2.1, anddiagrammed schematically in
Figure 4.Allresults presented here were obtained from cycle 13Drosophila embryos. 14
outof32probes toeuchromatic locishowed anonrandomly peripheral localization, which
weinterpret asindicating aninteraction with theNE. Outof6heterochromatic lociprobed,
only two(theAATAC satellite andtherDNA locus) were NEassociated, while four (the
AACAC satellite, Rsp, dodecasatellite, andthe359bp repeat) were not. Peripheral
localization ofaparticular probe does notnecessarily imply that anNEattachment site
resides within theregion ofhybridization, because anNEattachment sitenear, butnot
actually inside, theregion could besufficient torecruit theflanking region tothenuclear
periphery. Forthisreason, although clusters oflinked probes (forexample DS07167,
DS00178, DS06189, andDS02634) allshow peripheral localization, theactual attachment
sitedoes notnecessarily span such alarge region. The factthatmost attachment sites are
detected byseveral adjacent probes simply reflects thedesign ofthetest forNE
localization, which, asdetailed inMaterials andMethods, isexpected todetect locinear
enough toanactual NEbinding sitetohave their localization biased towards theperiphery,
even ifthelociprobed arenotthemselves bound totheNE. Inmany cases inTable 2.1,
oneprobe may bestrongly NEassociated while aneighboring probe has acompletely
random localization. These drastic differences inlocalization ofneighboring probes is
actually notsurprising inthattheprobes used here arespaced roughly 200kbapart onthe
genome based ontheir location onpolytene squashes. While wedonotknow how
genomic distance corresponds tophysical distance inDrosophila, work inmammalian cells
** *1: .
41(Yokota etal.,1995) hasindicated that loci 100kbapart areroughly 0.4plmapart in
interphase. Thus, probes 200 kbapart canpotentially have quite significant differences in
nuclear position. InTable 1itisapparent thatforrandom probes, approximately 50% of
theFISH spots areclassified as“peripheral”. This isduedirectly tothedefinition of
peripheral spots asthose which arecloser totheNEthan 50% ofrandomly generated
points. For arandomly localized point, thiswilloccur approximately 50% ofthetime.
Thus theresult inTable 1forrandom points isexactly what wewould expect apriori. For
most oftheprobes used here, data were collected from twoormore embryos. Inallsuch
cases, theresults foranyoneprobe arethesame indifferent embryos. Representative
probes were tested ondifferent batches offixed embryos andtheresults were consistent
between batches ofembryos.
Direct analysis ofNEcontact frequencies supports theconclusions ofthestatistical
analysis. Inthese images, theapparent width ofthelamin signal is0.5 pumand the
apparent diameter oftheFISH signal isapproximately 0.6pum. These dimensions are
significantly greater than thelateral resolution ofthemicroscope (approximately 0.1-0.2
pum) andthusprobably represent theactual size ofthefluorescent region. Distances used
forthisanalysis aremeasured from thecenter oftheFISH spot tothecenter ofthelamina,
asdescribed byequation 4inMaterials andMethods. However, ifchromatin ontheedge
oftheFISH spot were totouch theedge ofthelamina, thedistance between centers would
bethesum oftheradius oflamina andFISH spot, which is0.55 pum. Thus, anyspot
whose center iswithin approximately 0.55pum ofthecenter ofthelamina isclose enough to
potentially beincontact with theNE. Table 1tabulates thefrequency with which probes
fallwithin 0.6pumofthesurface, asdetermined byequation 4.Summing thedata inTable
2.1fortheindividual classes ofloci, theaverage frequencies with which aclose, random,
orfarFISH spot isclose enough totheNEtobetouching itare0.47, 0.31, and0.05,
respectively, verifying thatspots which areNEassociated according totheMonte Carlo test
areindeed more frequently near theNEthan random orfarpoints.)***

47Why domost NEassociated sites only contact theNEinafraction ofnuclei? First of
all,thestatistical test isdesigned todetect locinear butnotactually containing anNE
binding site, andsuch lociarenotexpected tocontact theNEinmost nuclei, even iftheir
localization isperipherally biased. Results presented below using asetofneighboring
probes inoneparticular peripheral region willfurther reinforce thispoint. Secondly, as
demonstrated below, atthebeginning ofinterphase, most NEassociated sites arerandomly
arranged within thenucleus, andsome time will berequired forthechromatin todiffuse to
theNEbefore anyinteraction ispossible. Because interphase incycle 13embryos isso
short (less than 20minutes, seeFoe etal.,1993), anddiffusion ofalarge polymer like
chromatin isslow, inasignificant fraction ofnuclei agiven NEinteraction sitewillsimply
nothave time toreach theNE, andthus will notbeable tomake contact with it.
Table 1also lists theaverage distance from each probe totheNE. Overall average
distances totheNEforthethree groups oflociclassified asclose, random, andfarare,
respectively, 0.78+0.2 pum, 1.03+0.25 pum, and1.52+0.41 pum. Thedifferences inthese
averages arehighly significant, with P-30.001. Thus, classification based ontheMonte
Carlo testreflects statistically significant differences indistance totheNE. Note that the
contact frequency andaverage distance differences donottake intoaccount effects dueto
differences innuclear shape orchromatin distribution, thus thefactthattheresults ofthe
Monte Carlo analysis aremirrored inthese simpler comparisons increases ourconfidence
thatthespecific details oftheMonte Carlo procedure arenotleading toerroneous results,
andalso suggests that theNEassociations seen arenotsosubtle astobemissed by
simpler measurements. Note alsothatthecomparison ofcontact frequencies hasthebeen
themost frequently applied criterion forNEassociation used byother workers
(Hochstrasser etal., 1986, Manuelidis and Borden, 1988). Differences incontact
frequency arealsoqualitatively evident bydirect inspection. Visual inspection (Figure 1)
reveals thatprobes which, bytheMonte Carlo test, areNEassociated, appear more
frequently tocontact theNEthanrandomly localized probes.
48Some loci, such asthehistone locus orthedodecasatellite (see Table 1)are
nonrandomly located intheinterior ofthenucleus. This localization isstatistically highly
significant (P<0.001) and isreproducible indifferent embryos. Asindicated inTable 1,
both heterochromatic (e.g. dodecasatellite) andeuchromatic (e.g. histone locus) regions
canshow thislocalization pattern.
NEassociations areestablished later than telophase
IftheNEinteractions described here aretheremnants ofinteractions primarily involved
inNEreassembly following mitosis, then these sites would have been bound toNE
vesicles following anaphase, andshould already beNEassociated during telophase. FISH
andlamin immunofluorescence were carried out,anddatacollected from telophase nuclei,
asshown inFigure 5.Allimages were acquired from nuclei inwhich NEassembly was
complete butinwhich nuclei hadnotyetrotated intotheir interphase orientation (reviewed
inFoe etal.1993). Orientation was determined bycarrying outFISH using
dodecasatellite probes tolocalize thecentromeric regions, asdescribed inExperimental
Procedures. Aslisted inTable 2.2,theNEassociation pattern intelophase isdramatically
different. Loci which areNEassociated during interphase aregenerally notNEassociated
during telophase, while other loci, such asdodecasatellite itself, appear NEassociated in
telophase but not ininterphase. These changes arereflected indifferences infrequency (fe)
ofNEcontact andaverage distance (dav) totheNE. Themost extreme example isthe
AATAC satellite which isstrongly NEassociated ininterphase butisinfactnonrandomly
farfrom theNEintelophase. Although thenucleus increases insizebetween telophase and
interphase, theAATAC siteactually becomes closer totheNE(dav goes from 0.9pumto
0.3pum). Thus, theinterphase NEinteractions tabulated inTable 2.1donotappear tobe
involved inNEassembly during telophase, butareinfactestablished later.

52Delimiting anNEbinding region using pairs ofprobes
Figure 4indicates thatrelatively large regions, defined byseveral adjacent FISH
probes, show some degree ofNEassociation. Forexample, theentire region 34F-35B
shows anonrandomly peripheral localization. Based onthesizescale oftheDrosophila
cytological map, where onedivision (e.g. 35)spans approximately 1Mb, theregion from
34F-35B isroughly 500 kbinsize. Does thisreflect ageneral adhesion over alarge
region, oristhere adiscrete binding sitewhich recruits flanking chromatin tothe
periphery? Inorder tolocate theactual NEinteraction sitewithin such alarge region,
embryos were hybridized simultaneously with pairs ofprobes, onelabeled with fluorescein
andonelabeled with rhodamine. Animage ofsuch anembryo isgiven inFigure 6A. In
each nucleus, thedistance from theNEtoeach FISH spot ineach color wasmeasured,
allowing ustoaskifonespot wasconsistently closer than another. IfoneFISH probe
hybridizes nearer to,orwithin, theactual NEbinding site, then itwilltend tobecloser to
theNEthan aFISH probe hybridizing further away. However, note thatbecause insome
nuclei thelocus may notactually bebound totheNEbutmerely coincidentally near the
periphery, itispossible fortheprobe that isfarther from thebinding sitetoactually be
closer totheNEinsome nuclei. Forthisanalysis, only pairs ofFISH spots forwhich at
least onespot waswithin 0.3pumoftheNEwere employed, sothatonly pairs which could
beincontact with theNEwere scored. Theresults forfourpairs ofprobes aregiven in
Table 3,andsummarized graphically inFigure 6B. Itthusappears thatprobe DS03933 is
closer totheNEthan anyother probe inthisregion, which isconsistent with the
frequencies ofNEcontact tabulated inTable 2.1. This result suggests that asingle NE
binding site isinornear theregion spanned byDS03933, with theremaining flanking
probes recruited totheperiphery because they arenear tothissiteonthechromosome.

56Polarized configuration ofinterphase chromosomes
Inmany celltypes, chromosomes arepolarized, with telomeres clustered atoneendof
thenucleus, andcentromeres clustered attheother. This polarized configuration isknown
astheRabl orientation (reviewed inComings 1980). Anoutstanding question, though, has
been towhat extent istheentire chromosome linearly polarized? Does thechromosome
follow ameandering path down through thenucleus, looping back onitself, orisitstrung
more directly, with vertical position amonotonicaly decreasing function ofgenomic
distance from thecentromere? Theanswer tothisquestion will, tosome extent, reflect the
degree ofdecondensation ofthemitotic chromosome. Thereason thisquestion hasbeen
difficult toaddress ingeneral isthatwhile both telomeres andcentromeres canbeshown to
beclustered, thisprovides noinformatino about thepath therestofthechromosome is
taking. Chromosome painting canbeused todelineate thewhole chromosome, butagain
thepath ofthechromosome fiber within thepainted domain cannot bedetermined. Thekey
istouseFISH together with anexternal frame ofreference todefine thevertical axis. In
Drosophila embryos allnuclei have thesame orientation relative totheembryo surface
(Hiraoka etal.,1990a, Hiraoka etal.,1993, Foe andAlberts, 1985), with centromeres
grouped outward, onthetopofthenucleus nearest tothesurface oftheembryo, and
telomeres pointing inwards. When 3Dimages arecollected, allnuclei intheembryo liein
aplane perpendicular totheoptical axis (Z-axis) ofthemicroscope. Foreach locus, the
average vertical position oftheFISH signal relative tothecenter ofmass ofthenucleus

58Different loci occupy defined positions inthenucleus
Anoutstanding question innuclear organization hasbeen theextent towhich agiven
locus occupies apredetermined position inthenucleus. Wecanmeasure position ofa
FISH spot bytwovalues, thevertical position (z)andtheradial distance tothesurface (d).
These twocoordinates areillustrated inFigure 8A,anddefined more precisely inMaterials
andMethods. Presumably, theRabl configuration setsthevertical position ofaparticular
locus andlocalization relative totheNEdetermines theaverage distance from thelocus to
theNE, thus setting theradial position. The average values ofthese twopositional
coordinates, listed inTable 1,areplotted forseveral loci inFigure 8B. Thestriking result
ofFigure 8Bisthatdifferent locidoinfactconsistently occupy different territories within
thenucleus. Furthermore, these coordinates canbespecified independently. Theposition
ofone site (the histone locus) was analyzed inembryos homozygous fortheItx13
translocation (Wakimoto andHearn 1990), which translocates theleftarm ofchromosome
2toadistal position ontheright armofchromosome 3(seeFigure 8C)with theeffect that
thehistone locus isnow shifted toamuch more distal position. Figure 8Dplots the
localization ofthehistone locus inItº13ascompared towildtype. Asexpected from its
more distal position, and ashasbeen previously demonstrated (Hiraoka etal.,1993), the
vertical position ofthislocus isnow more than 2pumlower inthenucleus, which iswhat a
Rabl configuration would predict. However, theaverage distance from thelocus totheNE
isthesame asinwild type, indicating thattheradial position isunaffected. Thebreakpoint
ofItº13on3Rislocated inregion 97D, andasshown inTable 1the97D region ismuch
closer totheNEthan thehistone locus. Thus, inItº13thehighly internal radial position
was indeed conferred bythehistone locus oritsflanking regions on2L,andwas nota

61DISCUSSION
Distribution ofNEassociation sites
Three-dimensional FISH inconjunction with asemiautomated statistical method has
been developed todetect specific chromatin-NE associations, andthisapproach hasbeen
used todemonstrate theexistence ofsite-specific chromatin-NE interactions innuclei in
intact cycle 13Drosophila embryos. Oneimportant caveat ofthiswork isthat inthecycle
13embryo zygotic transcription hasnotyetreached maximum levels, andthus itwill be
interesting inthefuture toexamine NEinteractions inlater embryos andadult tissues to
determine theeffects oftranscription anddifferentiation. Based onthese results, inwhich
NEcontacts have been mapped along aregion covering approximately onethird of
chromosome arm2L,weestimate thatthere areontheorder of15NEinteraction sites per
arm, oratotal of150NEassociation sites perdiploid nucleus. Note thatthisvalue has
been extrapolated from arelatively small portion ofthegenome, andthedensity ofNE
contact sites may differ inother regions. These NE-associated sites would bespaced, on
average, 1-2Mb apart, andcould thusdefine theboundaries oflarge loop domains tethered
totheNEininterphase. Evidence forlarge chromosome loops ontheorder of1Mb in
human interphase nuclei hasrecently been reported (Yokota etal.,1995). Wepropose that
large chromosome loops could betethered byattachment either totheNEortoaninternal
structure. Existence ofdistinct peripheral andinternal chromatin anchoring sites has
previously been proposed onthebasis ofinvitro experiments (Lebkowski andLaemmli,
1982). Inaddition toforming large loops, NEattachment could potentially have direct
effects ontheNEassociated loci. Itisapparent inFigure 4andfrom theresults given in
Figure 6Bthat alarge region (100-500 kb,assuming 1Mb perdivision) flanking each
interaction sitecanbebrought totheperiphery byarelatively discrete NEassociation site,
sothat NEbinding atonesitecould influence thesubnuclear localization ofarelatively**

62large flanking region. AnNEbinding sitecanthusexert aninfluence onsurrounding DNA
bytargeting ittotheNE.
Thespecificity ofNEassociation isinteresting inlight ofrecent work suggesting that
theprimary molecular interaction between chromatin andtheNEmay bebinding oflamin
protein tothecore histones (Taniura andGerace, 1995). Since thisinteraction does not
involve DNA itshould notbesequence specific. However, itisentirely possible thatlocal
variations inchromatin structure could bring about specific spatial arrangements of
nucleosomes which would beable tointeract cooperatively with thenuclear lamin lattice. If
thisturns outtobethecase, itwillbedifficult toisolate asmall DNA sequence thatconfers
NEassociation. Rather, association willbedictated bythechromatin context.
Only afraction ofheterochromatin isassociated with theNEinthese nuclei. This isin
contrast with acommon assumption that allheterochromatin isNEassociated, andsuggests
thatspecific DNA sequences, rather than theheterochromatic state ingeneral, arerequired
toconfer NEattachment toheterochromatin. Itis,however, probable that inthecycle 13
embryo, theheterochromatic state isnotyetfully established (Hiraoka etal.,1993).
Comparative studies ofNEassociation incycle 14embryos andmore developmentally
advanced tissues should resolve this issue.
Some regions (thehistone locus, dodecasatellite, andRsp) arenotonly notassociated
with theNE, butareinfactnonrandomly farfrom theNE. This type oflocalization has
been previously described inother celltypes (Lawrence etal.,1988, Hoefers etal.,1993,
Vourc'h etal.,1993), andmay reflect anassociation with aninternal matrix orscaffold.
This implies thatthenucleus maycontain atleast twotypes ofsubnuclear neighborhoods, a
peripheral NEassociated neighborhood, and aninternal, possibly matrix associated,
neighborhood.
Other loci areclassified asrandomly localized. However, this isbased solely on
distance totheNE,anddoes notimply thatthelocioccupy completely random positions inºsses

63thenucleus with respect toother criteria. Indeed, with respect tovertical positioning (the
Rabl orientation) thelocalization ofthese loci isclearly nonrandom.
Having identified several NEassociated loci, itshould now bepossible totesttheir
effects byinserting reporter genes intothese regions, orusing chromosome rearrangements
toalter thepattern ofattachment. Furthermore, thedoor isnow open foradirected search
forthemolecular components ofthese interactions. Inparticular, themethod illustrated in
Figure 6ofcomparing thelocalization ofpairs ofnearby probes should allow specific NE
binding sites tobepinpointed more precisely. Theprobes used inFigure 6Bfall ina
region spanned byacontiguous setofoverlapping P1genomic clones (Berkeley
Drosophila Genome Project, personal communication), which should allow us,inthenear
future, tomap theNEbinding site towithin asingle P1clone. Such experiments are
currently underway.
Comparison with previous studies ofnuclear organization
Three dimensional reconstructions ofpolytene nuclei from Drosophila salivary glands
(Hochstrasser etal.,1986) revealed anumber oflociwhich were found near theNEwith
anunusually high frequency. These frequent NEcontacts were observed atthesame loci
inother polytenized tissues (Hochstrasser andSedat, 1987) suggesting they may bea
general feature ofnuclear organization. The presence ofsites with relatively high
frequency ofperipheral localization relative toother sites could, however, reflect either an
NEassociation oftheformer sites oranonrandomly internal localization ofthelatter sites.
Inthose studies, four significant NEcontact sites were observed onchromosome 2L,at
regions 22A-B, 32F-33A, 34F-35C, and36C-E. (Hochstrasser etal.,1986). Figure 4
reveals that ofthethree regions tested sofar(22A-B, 32F-33A, and34F-35C) allthree
regions arealsoassociated with theNE intheembryo, suggesting thatthese interactions
can bemaintained over long developmental times, andfurther implying that thehigh
frequency surface contacts seen inthepolytene nuclei areindeed duetoNEassociations.lºss
º
64However, several regions that areassociated with theNE intheembryo, such as23A,
34A, and87B, arenotinparticularly frequent contact with theNE inpolytene nuclei
(Hochstrasser etal., 1986), suggesting that these associations may belost during
polytenization. This isconsistent with studies ofNE-chromosome contact inpolytene
chromosomes ofChironomus andAcricotopus (Quick, 1980) inwhich aprogressive loss
ofNEcontact wasfound toaccompany polytenization.
Telomere-NE interactions have been proposed toplay arole inmeiosis (Loidl, 1990)
andtelomeric silencing (Palladino etal.,1993). Peripheral localization oftelomeres during
interphase haspreviously been reported (Manuelidis andBorden, 1988, vanDekken etal.,
1989, Chung etal.,1990) while inother celltypes telomeres aremore internally located
(Ferguson andWard, 1992). Initial reports thattelomeres inyeast were NEassociated ina
SIR4 dependent manner (Palladino etal.,1993) have subsequently been retracted following
more careful three-dimensional analysis (Gasser 1996 7?????). While wehave notused
telomeric probes inthisstudy due todifficulties with secondary hybridization tonon
telomeric sites, themost distal probe employed thus far,DS07049, isindeed associated
with theNE. This isinagreement with theobservation than during prophase inthe
Drosophila embryo, telomeres often appear tobeincontact with theNE(Hiraoka etal.,
1990b).
Incontrast totelomeres, centromeres arealmost certainly notNEassociated inthe
Drosophila embryo. Cytological andgenetic studies have indicated thattheheterochromatic
Rspanddodecasatellite blocks areclosely linked tothecentromeres ofchromosomes 2and
3,respectively (Wu etal.1988, Pimpinelli andDimitri, 1989, Carmena etal., 1993).
Figure 4reveals thatboth Rspanddodecasatellite are, infact, nonrandomly farfrom the
NE,implying thatcentromeres arenotNEassociated, andmay interact with aninternal
nuclear structure. Such anonrandomly internal localization ofcentromeres haspreviously
been reported invertebrate cells (Hoefers etal.,1993, Zalensky etal.,1995) although
other groups have reported peripheral localization ofcentromeres (Manuelidis andBorden,2.5

Vourc'h etal.,1993).
Relation toSARs and other known chromosomal elements
Scaffold attachment regions have been described inDrosophila embryos (Gasser and
Laemmli, 1986). Asdiscussed above, SARs were potential candidates forNEassociation
sites because ofthepresence oflarge quantities ofnuclear lamin proteins inthescaffold
preparations. Four regions containing known SARs were probed inthepresent work. Of
these, two, theAdh (35B3) andhsp-70 (87A7) lociwere indeed within NEassociated
regions (seeTable 1).However, another SAR, contained intheftzlocus (84B1), was ina
randomly localized region, while afourth ,thehistone locus (39D-E), was infact
nonrandomly farfrom thesurface. This lastresult isparticularly interesting inlight of
claims thatnaked DNA containing theDrosophila histone SAR canspecifically bind lamin
paracrystals invitro (Luderus etal.,1992, Luderus etal.,1994). Ithas, however,
previously been demonstrated thatwhile Drosophila SAR DNA canbind nuclear scaffolds
invitro, ifscaffolds areprepared which arehighly enriched forlamins, andlacking the
internal protein network usually seen inother scaffold preparations (Lebkowski and
Laemmli, 1982), SAR DNA nolonger binds (Izaurralde etall,1988). Theinability of
SAR DNA tobind theNE-associated scaffold component invitro isconsistent with our
data from intact cells, andimplies thatSARs donotconfer NEassociation either invitro or
invivo. Inthetwocases where aSAR isfound inanNEassociated region, there isno
evidence thattheSAR sequence itself isrequired forNEassociation. There ismoreover a
great deal ofcontroversy surrounding theSAR preparation, andthere remains astrong
possibility thatthenuclear scaffold isanartifact produced bythehighly specific conditions
employed during itspreparation. Forinstance, scaffold preparations typically include both
lamins andtopoisomerase II,proteins which donotcolocalize within thecell,implying that
perhaps anylarge insoluble protein structures aggregate together during thescaffoldcº
66preparation. Thus, Scaffold associated sequences could bebinding tojust oneofthese
separate components, andthus have nothing todowith thenuclear envelope. Ontheother
hand, evidence forsome sort ofintranuclear skeletal structure invivo isgradually
accumulating. Recently wehave shown thattwocentrosomal proteins, CP60 andCP190,
enter thenucleus inDrosophial embryos andform aninsoluble protein network thatcanbe
observed inliving cells injected with labelled protein (K.Oegema, W.F. Marshall, J.
Sedat, and B.Alberts, manuscript submitted, seeappendix 22???). During prophase and
metaphase, when thenuclear envelope breaks down, these proteins remain inside the
nucleus implying thatthey areactually assembled into some sort oflarge structure that
could infact represent anuclear matrix (K.Oegema, W.F.Marshall, J.Sedat, and
B.Alberts, manuscript submitted, seeappendix 22???). How thisstructure relates tothe
usual scaffold preparations remains tobedetermined. Atany rate, though, the
CP60/CP190 network isuniform throughout thenucleus andthus would notbelikely tobe
thebasis forperipheral localization ofspecific chromatin regions.
One roleofNEassociated chromatin could betoform boundaries between independent
chromatin domains. Aclass ofloci, known asscs(specialized chromatin structure)
elements, have been described that may actasboundaries between chromatin domains
(Udvardy etal.,1988, Kellum andSchedl, 1992). Genes flanked byscselements are
insulated from euchromatic position effect andfrom theaction ofupstream enhancers,
suggesting thatthese sites function asboundaries ofchromatin domains, perhaps by
anchoring chromatin totheNEtoform topologically independent loops. While onescs
containing locus, hsp-70 (87A7), isinanNEassociated region, another, the90BC tRNA
locus, located atposition 90B-C, isnot. Thus there isnostrict correlation between NE
associated sites andscs-like elements. Wefurther note thatwhile topologically independent
loop domains have been observed inDrosophila (Benyajati andWorcel, 1976) they are
only 85kb inlength, onaverage, farsmaller than the1-2Mb loops defined bytheNEsºn

associations described here.****
67Genetic studies have ledtothediscovery ofmany chromosomal proteins that are
thought toinfluence chromatin structure andactivity. IfNEbinding requires particular
chromosomal proteins, itispossible thatgenetic identification ofsuch proteins may
eventually reveal theproteins involved inNEassociation. InDrosophila, thebinding sites
ofmany chromatin proteins have been determined, revealing alimited number ofregions
oneach chromosome thatbind different chromatin proteins. However, NEassociations
donotappear tocorrelate strictly with anyofthese binding sites. Forexample, the23A
NEassociated region contains binding sites forSu(z)2, Psc, and z,butnotph, Pc, orHP
1,while the33B NEassociated region contains binding sites forphandPc,but not
Su(z)2, Psc, z,orHP-1 (James etal., 1989, Rastelli etal.,1993). Therefore, NE
association does notappear torequire binding sites forz,Su(z)2, Psc, ph,Pc,orHP-1.
Recently, aninteraction hasbeen demonstrated invitro between themammalian lamin B
receptor and amammalian homolog ofHP-1 (YeandWorman 1996). Although wesaw
nocorrelation between thepositions ofHP-1 binding sites and NEassociation, the
possibility remains thatHP-1 binding sites may bedifferent intheembryo than insalivary
glands where they have been determined. Wehave made extensive attempts todemonstrate
aloss ofNEassociation inHP-1 nullmutant embryos, buthave notseen anydifference
(data notshown). However, because HP-1 isessential inDrosophila, wewere forced to
study thehomozygous embryos produced byparents heterozygous foranull allele of
Su(var).205 (thegene coding forHP-1 protein), andthus wecannot ruleoutthepossibility
thatNEassociation isrescued bymaternally contributed protein. Production ofgerm-line
clones (R.Kellum, personal communication) should allow thisquestion tobeaddressed in
thefuture.
Finally, NEassociation sites were compared tothelocations ofintercalary
heterochromatin (IH). Intercalary heterochromatin (Zhimulev etal.,1982) refers toasetof

68frequency ofchromosome breaks, andformation ofectopic fibers. On2L,IHisfound in
regions 22A, 25A, 25E-F, 33A-B, 34E-35A, 35C-F, 36D, and39E, asjudged primarily
byfrequency ofectopic fiber formation (Zhimulev etal.,1982). Asseen inTable 1,three
ofthese IH-containing regions coincide with NEassociated regions, while one, 39E, isina
region that isnonrandomly farfrom theNE. Thus, while many IHregions areNE
associated inembryos, some arenot. Inaddition, itisclear thatsome NEassociated
regions (forexample 34A or87B) areclearly notIHbyanycriterion. Thus, IHisneither
strictly necessary norsufficient forNEassociation. However, IHhasbeen cytologically
defined only inpolytene nuclei, and itispossible thattheexact distribution ofregions with
IHproperties isdifferent indiploid interphase nuclei. Inspite ofthese differences, thefact
thatthree ofthemost significant IHsites on2L(Zhimulev etal.,1982) correspond exactly
toNEassociations seen there issuggestive ofsome underlying relation between IHandNE
association. This isalsosupported bythefactthatessentially allpolytene NEcontact sites
(seeabove) correspond toIHregions (Hochstrasser etal.,1986).
Relation tolamin-fiber associated chromatin
Invitro binding studies have suggested thatlamins may bind chromatin, either directly
(Glass andGerace, 1990, Yuan etal.,1991, Glass etal.,1993, Luderus etal.,1992,
Luderus etal.,1994) orvialamin-associated proteins (Foisner andGerace, 1993).
Interactions ofspecific lociwith nuclear lamins could bethebasis fortheassociations
observed here. Thenuclear lamina inDrosophila embryos appears inthelight microscope
toconsist ofareticular basketlike structure composed oflarge fibers (Paddy etal.,1990).
Previous studies have revealed thatapproximately 20–30 chromosomal sites, asdetected by
DAPI staining, areclose enough tooneofthese large lamin fibers topotentially bein
contact with it(Paddy etal.,1990). While thenumber (20-30) ofsuch sites issignificantly
lessthan thenumber ofspecific NEassociated sites reported here, itispossible that a
fraction oftheNEassociated sites doindeed bind totheregions ofheavy lamin staining,agºs

69while theremainder interact with more diffusely organized lamins, orwith some other NE
components, such asnuclear pore complexes. Insupport ofthislatter possibility, some
nuclear pore components contain DNA binding motifs (Sukegawa andBlobel, 1993).
Aputative lamin-associated DNA region hasbeen identified inDrosophila (Baricheva
etal.,1996) using aninvitro binding assay. FISH using probes made with thisclone
indicated aperipheral localization inpolytene nuclei from thesalivary gland, however,
these results aredifficult tointerpret because theclone maps tothecentric heterochromatin.
Insalivary gland nuclei, thecentric heterochromatin from allchromosomes coalesces
together toform acompact chromocenter, which isknown tobeNEassociated
(Hochstrasser etal22????). Thus, anyprobe mapping tothecentric heterochromatin will
appear NEassociated insalivary gland nuclei, butthisdoes notnecessarily mean thatthis
clone actually isresponsible forthislocalization. Wefeelthatrather than start with invitro
binding, amuch more productive approach tofinding specific NE-association elements in
thegenome istoprogressively narrow down thesite byusing thetwo-probe method
developed here (Figure 6),andthen eventually totransform theDrosophila genome with
subclones from thisregion.
Alternative models forapparent NEassociation
This work isbased ontheassumption that theFISH procedure employed does not
strongly affect theposition ofchromatin within thenucleus. Comparison ofhybridized
chromosomes with both living andfixed non-hybridized chromosomes does notindicate
anysignificant rearrangement due totheFISH procedure (Hiraoka etal.,1993). The
minor structural differences between hybridized andunhybridized chromatin arelikely tobe
significant only atmuch higher resolution thancurrently available inthelight microscope,
andshould notaffect thestatistical testemployed, which tests foranoverall bias in
localization rather than actual contact with theNE, and isthus only affected byrelatively
large displacements. Theprecise vertical positioning reported here isalso notconsistent**

7Owith ascrambling ofnuclear organization following hybridization. Ultimately, however,
analysis ofnuclear organization inliving cells willberequired tocompletely settle this
point.
Wehave tacitly assumed thatthestrongly peripheral localization observed isduetoan
interaction ofchromatin with theNE. While thisinterpretation isthesimplest, and is
consistent with asignificant body ofliterature supporting theexistence ofsuch interactions,
nevertheless several alternate models must beconsidered.
First, since weknow thatsome sites arenonrandomly localized tothenuclear interior,
itispossible thattheremaining chromosome regions could become peripheral duetoeither
excluded volume effects orrigid loops extending outward. Ifsuch alarge fraction ofthe
inner 50% ofthenucleus wasoccupied by"internal" sites astoproduce thestrong
peripheral localizations seen here, then allother sites, notjust some, should appear
nonrandomly peripheral. This isobviously notthecase, asmany sites appear randomly
localized. Moreover, anexcluded volume effect would notexplain why only certain loci
appear consistently peripheral.
Asecond possibility isthatextended loops may runoutward from internally anchored
points, thusdirecting some locitoaperipheral location. This model requires theexistence
ofinternal anchor points between anytwoperipheral sites. Such internal anchor regions
should appear nonrandomly farfrom theNE. However, asseen inTable 1,farpoints do
notingeneral occur between peripheral sites. Thus, peripheral localization isunlikely to
beaconsequence ofinternal localization ofother sites, either byexcluded volume orrigid
loops.
Finally, itremains aformal possibility thattheperipheral sites areassociated, notwith
theNEperse,butwith some unknown peripheral structure which may ormay notbe
anchored totheNE. With regards totherolethese interactions may play innuclear
organization andchromosome dynamics, thenature oftheperipheral structure towhichagºs

71they areattached may belessimportant, and inanyevent, thisquestion willcertainly be
resolved once themolecular determinants oftheinteractions described here areidentified.
Interphase NEinteractions are notremnants ofNEreassembly
One interesting function forchromatin-NE interaction would betomediate NE
reassembly following mitosis bybinding NEvesicles toanaphase chromosomes. Ifsuch
binding interactions were topersist until interphase, then attelophase, when theNE has
reassembled, theinteractions should already beestablished, which asseen inTable 2,is
notthecase. Therefore, thespecific interactions seen between chromatin andtheNEin
interphase arenotthesame astheinteractions thatbind NEvesicles tochromosomes
following mitosis. Wenote thatchanges innuclear positioning ofcentromeres have
recently been demonstrated invivo inmammlian cells using aGFP-centromere binding
protein fusion. Thus, extensive nuclear rearrangement following chromosome
decondensation islikely tobeauniversal feature ofthecells cycle inallspecies. This result
also illustrates thatchromatin canundergo rather substantial large-scale motions during
interphase, aresult wehave obtained more directly byvisualizing chromosome motion in
vivo (seeChapter 4).
Rabl orientation ininterphase
The Rabl orientation, with centromeres atone end ofthenucleus andtelomeres atthe
other (reviewed inComings 1980), isevident inDrosophila embryos during prophase
(Hiraoka etal.,1990b) andfollowing anoxia-induced premature chromosome condensation
(Foe andAlberts, 1985). Ininterphase, FISH hasrevealed thatsubtelomeric sequences are
located near thebottom ofthenucleus facing theembryo interior (Hiraoka etal.,1990a).
Furthermore, Hoechst staining ininterphase reveals brightly fluorescing heterochromatic
blocks located near thetopofthenucleus inDrosophila virilis embryos (Ellison and
Howard, 1981). However, theextent towhich thechromosome arms themselves followsº
**º

72thisarrangement along their entire length isunknown. Insalivary nuclei thepath ofthe
chromosomes isnotparticularly straight, andoften loops back before eventually reaching
theother side ofthenucleus (Hochstrasser etal.,1986). Diploid interphase chromosomes
aremore flexible than polytene chromosomes, andmight beexpected apriori tofollow an
even more meandering path through thenucleus. FISH studies ofthehistone
locus(Hiraoka etal.,1993) revealed ittobeconstrained toadefined vertical region. As
described above, thisholds true foralllociinvestigated here, with each locus lying inan
approximately 111m wide vertical position defined relative tothecenter ofthenucleus (see
Figure 8B). Moreover, aslisted inTable 1,andplotted inFigure 7,theaverage vertical
position iscorrelated with genome position exactly asexpected from aRabl configuration.
Loci near thecentromere arefound near thetopofthenucleus, while locinear thetelomere
arenear thebottom ofthenucleus. Apparent exceptions tothisrule(such asDS00889 vs.
DS02809) areforthemost partminor differences between nearby loci, andareprobably
due toembryo toembryo variation innuclear size. However, wecannot ruleout,from this
study, thepossibility ofdeviations from thestrict Rabl configuration duetochromosome
arms looping back within thenucleus. Itisclear that inaddition totheclustering of
telomeres andcentromeres atopposite ends ofthenucleus, other locionthechromosome
arm aresimilarly constrained according tothegeneral polarization ofthenucleus. This
high degree ofconstraint islikely torequire anchoring ofchromosomes toarigid structure
ofsome sort, andtheNEinteractions reported here could serve such arole.
Positional Determination ofChromosomal Loci within the
Interphase Nucleus
Animportant result ofthisstudy isthatdifferent locireproducibly occupy defined
regions ofthenucleus, asdetailed inFigure 8B. This istrueeven forlocinotassociated
with theNE. Some aspects ofthispositioning aremaintained inatranslocation (Figure
8D). Furthermore, even lociclassified asrandom with respect toNEassociation appear to*

73have aspecific nuclear sublocalization onthevertical axisandpossibly also theradial axis,
consistent with theidea that asthechromosome loops infrom theNE, locialong theloop
occupy preferred radial positions. The size oftheerror bars could reflect variation in
nuclear size, cellcycle-dependent ordevelopmental changes (including apoptosis), or
interphase chromosome motion. Regarding thelatter point, wehave developed methods to
track interaphse chromatin motion inliving cells, with theresult that thismotion is
constrained, inatleast some cases, toasmall sub-region ofthenucleus (seeChapter 4).
This constraint may bethetemporal reflection ofthespatial confinement observed here.
Specific positioning within thenucleus could have astrong effect onprocesses such as
transvection orrecombination thatinvolve physical interactions between loci, since loci in
twocompletely disparate regions would notbeable tointeract. The data inFigure 8D
demonstrate that itispossible tousechromosome rearrangements toalter thevertical
position ofaparticular locus within thenucleus. Similarly, wehave recently demonstrated
(Dernburg etal1996) that achromosome region can betargetted totheNE, without
affecting itsvertical position, bytheinsertion ofanNEassociated heterochromatic satellite
block. Bymanipulating nuclear organization inthismanner, itshould bepossible totest
whether ornotthisdefined nuclear positioning plays afunctional role.
Thedata inFigure 8Dalsoimply thatvertical positioning isdetermined primarily by
location within thegenome, inaccordance with theRabl configuration, while radial
distance totheNE isamore local property ofaparticular region. This isconsistent with
theresult that NE associations areestablished after chromosome decondensation in
telophase.
This is,toourknowledge, thefirstclear evidence forspecific positioning ofmultiple
different euchromatic loci within theinterphase nucleus. Prior studies of3Dnuclear
organization (Manuelidis andBorden, 1988, Van Dekken et.al.,1990, Ferguson and
Ward, 1992, Hoefers etal.,1993, Vourc'h etal.,1993) have focused ononly one or
two, generally heterochromatic, locisuch ascentromeres ortelomeres. Itislikely that a*

74more extensive analysis ofthelocalization ofalarge number ofsites would reveal asimilar
degree ofpositioning asthatseen here. TheDrosophila embryo proved particularly well
suited tothese studies, however, since allnuclei inonedataset arehighly synchronized and
oriented thesame wayrelative tothesurface oftheembryo, which allowed avertical axis to
bedefined. Wepredict that inthefuture, theradial andvertical positioning demonstrated
here willturn outtobeageneral feature ofnuclear organization inother celltypes. The
functional significance ofsuch positioning nowremains tobedetermined.

85Chapter 3.Interphase Chromatin Undergoes Large-Scale Diffusional Motion in
Living Cells
SUMMARY
While many essential biological processes require large-scale chromosomal motion, the
dynamic behavior ofinterphase chromatin isnotknown. Indeed, thehigh concentration
andlarge size ofthechromatin polymer, along with thepossibility ofinteractions with
thenuclear envelope ornuclear matrix, would suggest thatinterphase chromatin might be
relatively immobile. Toaddress thisissue experimentally, wehave, forthefirst time,
been able todirectly measure chromatin motion anddiffusion inliving cells of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae andDrosophila melanogaster. Thediffusion constant was

86INTRODUCTION
Chromatin motion isintrinsic tomany essential processes inmolecular biology,
including homologous recombination, meiotic homolog pairing, chromosome
condensation, andenhancer looping. These processes allrequire that two initially
Separated chromosome regions come together andinteract. The rates atwhich these
interactions cantake place depends onhow fastthenecessary segments ofchromatin can
move. Therefore, knowing therate atwhich chromatin diffuses isessential for
understanding themechanism andkinetics ofthese processes. Ithasbeen argued that
since chromatin issuch alarge polymer, itsdiffusion might notbefastenough formany
processes, particularly meiotic homology searches (Maguire, 1984), totake place by
diffusion alone. This hasledtotheproposal ofmore elaborate active mechanisms that
would notbediffusion limited (Smithies andPowers, 1986). Clearly, aquantitative
measurement ofchromatin mobility would help tosettle thispoint. Here wereport the
direct measurement ofthediffusive motion ofchromatin within nuclei inliving cells of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae andDrosophila melanogaster, which indicates thatdiffusive
motion ofchromatin issufficiently fastformotion-requiring processes tobeable tooccur
bydiffusion alone.
Ofdirect relevance tothequestion ofchromatin motion isthequestion ofchromatin
positioning. Our work (Marshall etal1996) hasdirectly demonstrated thatdifferent
chromosomal locioccupy defined positions within thenucleus. Ifchromatin isable to
undergo diffusional motion, how could such positioning bemaintained? Oneexplanation
could bethatchromatin may beanchored tolarge, relatively immobile nuclear structures
Such asthenuclear envelope ornuclear matrix. Ifchromatin were tobetethered tosuch a
structure atafewdiscrete sites, assuggested fortheNEby(Marshall etal1996), then the
chromatin inbetween tethering sites would form mobile loops which could diffusive
within alimited region ofthenucleus, thusallowing limited diffusional search within the
context ofanoverall nuclear organization. Inprinciple, measurement ofchromatin
87motion could distinguish thistype ofconstrained motion from freediffusion, andthus test
forinteractions ofchromatin with animmobile structure inliving cells.
Chromatin isalso ofinterest from thestandpoint ofpolymer dynamics. Thebehavior
oflarge polymers iscurrently thesubject ofintense research inthephysics community.
Recently, significant progress hasbeen made inthestudy ofDNA asapolymer (Chu
refs, etc.) which hasrevealed insights intobasic polymer physics. Theextension ofsuch
polymer-dynamics studies ofmacromolecules tothestudy ofmolecules invivo remains a
challenging andfascinating problem. How dointeractions with structural components
andenzymes within thecellaffect polymer conformation anddynamics? Inparticular,
topoisomerase IIislikely tohave profound effects onDNA behavior. Direct quantitative
measurements ofchromatin motion invivo will provide abasis forcomparing the
dynamics ofisolated polymers with those ofalarge polymer inaliving context.
Themain technical challenge inmeasuring chromatin motion isdeveloping amethod
tovisualize theposition ofadiscrete chromosome site inliving cells. Fluorescence in
situhybridization (FISH) canbeused todetect theposition ofanarbitrary DNA sequence
inthenucleus, butrequires thecells tobefixed anddenatured, thusmaking itimpossible
tomeasure themotion ofthespot under invivo conditions. While DNA stains canbe
used tovisualize thechromatin invivo, itisimpossible todistinguish individual
chromosomes during interphase bysuch means. Thus, weneed torely onmore elaborate
means totrack interphase chromosome motion.
Materials and Methods
Visualizing chromosome motion inyeast using GFP-lac repressor
Cells were grown andmounted asdescribed (Straight etal.,1996; Robinett etal.,1996).
Cells mounted inthis way continue togrow anddivide normally. Time-lapse 3
dimensional images were collected atrates ofone3-dimensional data setevery 12s,24s,
or96s, using wide-field deconvolution 3-dimensional microscopy (Agard etal.,1989)
88using a60xN.A. 1.4objective and 1.5180 oil. Ateach time point, 14256x256 pixel
images were collected atfocal plane increments of0.25 pumperplane. Forhigh-speed
datacollection (one dataset every 12seconds) only 7sections were acquired.
Simulation ofrandom walk motion
Random walks were simulated onacubic lattice (Lee etal.,1991; Kao andVerkman,
1994) fortwoparticles. Atthestart ofeach run, theparticles were set2.0 pumapart
(initial distance didnotaffect theoutcome significantly). Foreach time step(t=50 ms),
thex,y,and zcoordinates oftheparticle were independently incremented ordecremented
(with equal probability) by6–2Dt (Lee etal.,1991). Wenote thatwhile atashort time
scale, thisalgorithm generates auniform step size, incontrast totheGaussian step size
expected forBrownian motion, atlarger time-scales, thenetdisplacement becomes
Gaussian asaconsequence ofthecentral limit theorem approximation, provided that the
number ofdiscrete uniform steps isfairly large. This iswhy weemploy avery short time
intervals (50ms) relative tothetime intervals actually reported attheend (5s).To
represent confinement, anystep causing either particle toexceed afixed confinement
distance Rfrom itsinitial position wasrejected, and anew stepchosen. Thedistance d(t)
between thetwoparticles wasstored every 5seconds ofsimulation, with 1800 steps
stored perrun. Finally, 200runs were averaged tocompute <Ad2- vs.At.Tofind the
values ofDand Rthatbest fittheobserved data, simulations were runfordifferent values
ofDand R,changing Dinincrements of0.5x10-12 cm2/s and Rin0.025 pumincrements.
Foreach setofvalues, themean-squared difference between theobserved data andthe
simulation forcorresponding values ofAtwascomputed, andtheDand Rwhich together
resulted intheleast squared error were chosen.
Estimation ofmeasurement precision
89Weapproximate theobserved distance d(t) astheactual distance d'(t) plus azero-mean
random offset 6such that 6isuncorrelated between successive measurements, anddefine
therms error indistance measurement tobeW262s. Clearly Ad(At)2> approaches
2<6°- when Atbecomes small. Forthesmallest measured timeinterval Atmin (inthis
case, 12sec)<Ad’(tmin)” isstillnonzero (approximately 0.004 pm2 forthefixed cells
inFigure 2B), thus2<62- must belessthan<Ad(Atmin)”, from which weconclude the
distance measurement precision N-62-s O.04pm.
Arrest ofmetabolism with sodium azide
Cells were grown andGFP-LacI expression induced under identical conditions tothose
used forthenon-azide treated cells. Following induction ofGFP-LacI, sodium azide was
added from a10% stock solution toafinal concentration of0.02%. Cells were then
incubated for20minutes atroom temperature toallow depletion ofcellular ATP. Cells
were then mounted andobserved inthecontinuous presence ofazide. Data from atotal
of30cells with anaverage of31time points perdata record were combined andplotted
inFig. 2B. Toverify thetoxic effect ofazide onthese cells, growth curves were carried
outinthepresence andabsence ofazide andindicated acomplete arrest ofcelldivision in
theazide treated cells. Theeffect ofazide onmetabolism islikely tobevery rapid:
addition of0.02% azide tocells undergoing mitotic division results inanimmediate
arrest (Aaron Straight, personal communication). Addition ofazide hasbeen shown to
block movement ofcortical actin patches (Doyle andBotstein, 1996) within 30min, and
azide causes aloss ofendonuclease activity inyeast within 15minutes (James Haber,

been done (H.Itoiand J.Swedlow, pers. comm.), wefound itmore convenient tosimply
inject allembryos andthen select only those attheapprorpriate stage. Three dimensional
images were collected from cycle 12or13embryos, using wide-field deconvolution
microscopy (32), using a60xN.A. 1.4objective lens and1.5180 oil. Ateach time point,
asetof16256x256 pixel images were collected atfocal plane increments of0.5pum.
One3-dimensional dataset wascollected every 20s.
Measuring position ofthetopoisomerase IIfocus
Thenuclear center wasdefined asthecentroid ofthenuclear boundary traced from the
outline ofthenuclear image. Inorder tocompute thecentroid, wefirst fitthesurface
points with asurface harmonic expansion (Marshall etal1996). Then, thespherical
coordinate angles theta andphiarestepped inuniform increments, andthen theaverage
x,y, and zcoordinate ofallpoints thus generated istaken asthecenter ofthenucleus.
This surface resampling procedure was used inorder tomake themethod insensitive to
anynonuniformities intheinteractive point picking (forexample, more points picked on
oneside ofthenucleus than theother). Thetopoisomerase IIfocus position wasdefined
byinteractively picking thespot andtaking anintensity-weighted center ofmass around
thechosen point.
RESULTS
Constrained Diffusion ofChromatin inYeast
Inorder totrack thediffusion ofchromatin intheyeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we
take advantage ofarecently developed method (Straight etal.,1996; Robinett etal.,
1996) tovisualize arrays ofLacoperator sites inserted intheyeast genome, byexpressing
afusion oftheLacrepressor protein with thegreen fluorescent protein (GFP-LacI).y>D
91Diploid yeast homozygous foraninsertion oftheLacoperator array intotheLEU2 locus
near thecentromere ofchromosome IIIwere imaged inthree dimensions asshown inFig.
1.Only unbudded (and hence intheG1phase ofthecellcycle) cells were examined in
order toavoid motion caused bythemitotic spindle. Cells remained alive during imaging
asjudged bytheir ability tosuccessfully undergo mitotic nuclear division. Once wehave
imaged theposition oftheLacoperator array over time, itsdiffusion constant canbe
computed. This approach isknown assingle-particle tracking (Gelles etal.,1988; Qian
etal.,1991), andrelies onthefactthatbylocating thecenter ofmass oftheimage ofan
object, very small displacements canbemeasured with aprecision limited only bythe
signal tonoise ratio oftheimage, andnotbytheresolution limit ofthemicroscope. At
each time point, thethree dimensional distance d(t)between thetwoGFP spots was
measured. Distance between twospots, rather than theposition ofasingle spot, isused
tocompensate fordrift orrotation ofthenucleus (Parvinen andSoderstrom, 1976; De
Boni andMintz, 1986) which might otherwise lead toapparent motion. Atypical plotof
d(t)foronenucleus isgiven inFig2A.Denoting atime interval byAtandthechange in
distance dduring thisinterval Ad,wecompute themean-squared change ind(t)as<Ad2>
=<!d(t)-d(t+At)]2 −.Allcomputation iscarried out interms ofAd2 rather than Ad
because thehallmark ofrandom-walk diffusive motion isthatunlike ordinary linear
motion, inwhich distance changes linearly with time, distance foradiffusing particle
changes, onaverage, linearly with thesquare root oftime (Berg 1983). Thus, byplotting

particular, fortwoparticles undergoing three-dimensional random walks with diffusion
constant D,itcanbeshown that aplotof«Ad’s vs.Atshould belinear with aslope of

expression fordisplacement versus time (6Dt) due tothefact that wearemeasuring

96persistent directed motion such asthatproduced byatypical motor protein, weexpect
that‘Ad’s vs.Atwill nolonger belinear, butrather willcurve upwards. This hasbeen
demonstrated inmany cases where particle motion ismeasured inthepresence offlow.
Atotal of110data records, each from adifferent cell, were averaged andplotted in
Figure 2B. Atshort timeintervals, wedoindeed observe amonotonic increase ofAd”-
with increasing At,suggesting diffusive motion. Because theplot does notcurve
upwards, weruleoutflow ordirected motion.
Forlong time intervals, incontrast, theplot ishorizontal, implying that theaverage
displacement isindependent ofthetime interval. This behavior atlong time intervals is
theexpected result ifthediffusion ofthetwoparticles isconstrained, that is,each particle
isconfined todiffuse within some limited region ofconfinement from which itcannot
escape. Confinement would beexpected if,forexample, thechromatin wastethered to
thenuclear envelope. Theplateau height depends onthesize oftheconfinement region,
while thesteepness oftheplot atshorter time scales depends onthediffusion constant.
Wehave used computer simulations tomodel thisprocess. Based onthese simulations,
theexperimental data arebestdescribed byaparticle with D=5x10-12 cm2/s confined to
aregion ofradius R=0.3 plm(rms fitting error in<Ad2> is4x10-3 pm2). This radius is
significantly smaller than theradius ofthediploid nucleus (about 1.5pum), andreflects
confinement ofthechromatin toasmall nuclear sub-region, less than onetenth the
volume ofthenucleus, which could reflect anchorage tothenuclear envelope oran
internal nuclear skeleton.
Toruleoutthepossibility that theobserved motion wascaused byrandom error due
toimprecision inmeasurement oftheposition ofthetwoGFP spots, wemeasured the
apparent motion informaldehyde-fixed yeast cells that were imaged under identical
conditions tothose ofthelivecells (intensities, andhence signal tonoise ratios, were the
same asforlivecells, leading toequivalent measurement precision). Asplotted inFigure
2B,motion inliving cells wasmuch greater than infixed cells, andwasthus notdue toº:
97limited measurement precision. Using data from fixed cells, theerror oftheindividual
position measurements isestimated tobelessthan 0.04 pum, which issmall relative tothe
displacements observed inliving cells. This result emphasizes that, aswith allsingle
particle tracking experiments, itispossible tomeasure displacements much smaller than
theresolution limit ofthemicroscope, because resolution does notaffect theprecision of
position measurements.
The constrained motion observed here could, inprinciple, beexplained without
invoking diffusion ifthechromatin wasfixed within anucleus thatwasitself undergoing
elastic deformations. These deformations would cause proportional displacements
between anypairofpoints embedded inthenucleus, andwould give risetoanapparent
constraint ifthedeformations were limited inextent. This model predicts that the
displacement between twopoints resulting from anelastic deformation oftheentire
nucleus will beproportional tothedistance between thepoints. However, when the
average magnitude ofthedisplacements <ld(t)-d(t+At)|> wasplotted versus thedistance
d(t), forafixed time interval At=24s, nosuch correlation was seen (data notshown).
Hence, themotions areunlikely toresult from asimple elastic deformation.
Chromatin Movement IsPredominantly Brownian
The random walk motion observed could inprinciple bedueeither toBrownian
motion, involving collisions with thermally excited solvent particles, orelse itcould be
driven byenzymes ormotor proteins whose direction ofmotion isuncorrelated over the
time-scales weexamine, thus leading toanapparent random walk. This question is
important because ifthemotion isactively driven, then mutations inthemotile
machinery would beexpected tohave effects onawide variety ofprocesses involving
chromosome motion. The idea thatchromosome motion could beanactive process isnot
unreasonable. Inaddition totheenzymes ofDNA metabolism, which canactasmotors
(Yin etal.,1996), anumber ofpotential motor proteins including theSMC family of:
98proteins (Hirano etal., 1995; Koshland and Strunnikov, 1996) and possibly
myosin/actin-related nuclear proteins (Weber etal.,1995) have been identified inthe
nucleus. Totestforarequirement ofmetabolic activity, werepeated theexperiment
described above inthepresence of0.02% azide which poisons cellular metabolism by
blocking therespiratory electron transport chain. Asplotted inFigure 2B,diffusion of
chromatin isonly slightly reduced inthepresence ofalethal dose ofazide. This small
reduction might reflect theinvolvement ofactive motors inmoving thechromatin.
However, itisclear that most ifnotallthechromatin motion weobserve continues inthe
absence ofactive metabolism, and isthus likely toreflect trueBrownian motion.
Chromatin Diffusion IsSize-Independant
Thediffusion oftracer molecules incytoplasm depends strongly onthesize ofthe
molecules, which isthought toreflect aneffective mesh sizeofaprotein network inthe
cytoplasm (Luby-Phelps etal.,1988). Tosimilarly determine how achromosome’s size
affects itsdiffusion inthenucleus, wemeasured themotion ofasmall circular
centromere-containing plasmid. Weused a15kbCEN plasmid ofwhich 10kbwas Lac
operator repeats, thusmost oftheplasmid wasvisualized. Because CEN plasmids have a
lowcopy number itwaspossible tolocate cells with twodistinct spots corresponding toa
copy number oftwo, andthese were used tocompute <Ad’s vs.Atasplotted inFigure
2C. Because theplasmid ismuch smaller than thechromosome weexpected that D
should bemuch higher fortheplasmid. Surprisingly, Dfortheplasmid was3x10-12
cm2/s, which isactually slightly less than forthechromosome. Thus, contrary to
expectation, locionshorter pieces ofchromatin donotnecessarily diffuse anyfaster than
loci onlonger ones. Ifconfinement ofdiffusion infactreflects tethering ofdiscrete
chromosome sites toanimmobile structure, then thesurprising lack ofsizedependence
ofthediffusion constant can beexplained, because thediffusion constant would depend
notontheoverall size ofthechromosome, butrather onthelength ofchromatin between:
99Successive tethering points. Ifthespacing oftethering points issimilar forallchromatin,
then thediffusion constant would beindependent ofchromosome size.
Chromatin Diffusion InDrosophila Embryos
Forcomparison wemeasured chromatin motion inDrosophila melanogaster by
exploiting anovel localization pattern oftopoisomerase II.InDrosophila, topoisomerase
IIshows diffuse localization along allchromosome arms, butinaddition accumulates at
1-2discrete foci pernucleus (Swedlow etal.,1993). Totest ifthese focireflect site
specific chromosome binding, topoisomerase IIimmunofluorescence wascarried out in
Drosophila embryos (Mitchison andSedat, 1983) using anti-topoisomerase IIpolyclonal
antibodies, following fluorescence insituhybridization (FISH) using DNA probes to
different heterochromatic satellite regions (Dernburg etal.,1996). Thetopoisomerase II
spot did not correlate with therDNA locus ortheRsp heterochromatin block, but
colocalized precisely with the359bp repeat block (Hsieh andBrutlag, 1979; Lohe etal.,
1993) onthe Xchromosome (Fig 3). The positions andshapes oftheFISH and
immunofluorescence signals exactly coincide, implying thattopoisomerase IIbinding is
co-extensive with theentire 359bp repeat region. Inagreement with these findings, the
most common topoisomerase II-specific drug-stimulated cleavage site intheDrosophila
genome isfound inthe359bp repeat sequence (Kas and Laemmli, 1992). Thus,
topoisomerase IIisone ofagrowing number ofproteins known tobind tospecific
heterochromatic regions (Masumoto etal.,1989, Raff etal.,1994). This provides a
means totrack aspecific chromosome region: byinjecting fluorescently labeled
topoisomerase IIintoliving embryos theaccumulation focicanbeimaged, revealing the
motion oftheunderlying chromatin (Fig 3I). Embryos remained alive during imaging as
judged bynormal synchronized nuclear divisions andsubsequent successful hatching. To
compensate fornuclear drift, wecompute thedistance r(t)from thetopoisomerase IIspot
tothecenter ofthenucleus. Foraparticle withdiffusion constant D,Ar’s vs.At:

slightly larger value than inyeast. The plot does notplateau, sothediffusion appears
unconstrained. This apparent lack ofconfinement isinteresting inlight ofevidence that
thisregion isascaffold-associated region (SAR) inDrosophila (Kas andLaemmli, 1992).
One would have anticipated thatinteraction with alarge insoluble nuclear scaffold
spanning thenuclear interior, such asthatvisualized inelectron microscopy ofnuclear
matrix preparations (Capco etal.,1982), should result instrong confinement ofdiffusion.
If,however, thescaffold invivo actually represents aflexible chromosome backbone or
some other highly dynamic structure, then thepresence ofSARs inthe359bp repeat need
notnecessarily lead toadiffusion constraint. Moreover, thepresent Drosophila data only
covers arelatively fasttime-scale, andhence ourresults donotaddress confinement on
longer time scales. Indeed, wehave demonstrated byFISH that infactdifferent loci in
Drosophila, including the359bp repeat, reproducibly localize toparticular regions ofthe
nucleus (Marshall etal1996), which strongly implies thatsome sortofconfinement will
indeed beobserved onalonger time scale.
DISCUSSION
Wehave developed amethodology tomeasure themotion ofchromatin ininterphase
nuclei ofliving cells. Such measurements reveal thatdiffusive motion ofchromatin does
indeed occur, butthismotion isconstrained insome cases.
Comparison With Other Studies ofChromatin Motion
Previous studies ofchromatin inliving cells have generally indicated rotational
motion ofthenucleus asthepredominant type ofchromatin motion (6).Ourstudy differs
from thisearlier work inthat wehave deliberately chosen touserotationally invariantl
:
}
104measures (dand r)sothatchanges ofposition within thenucleus, rather than overall
nuclear rotation, can bemeasured directly. Apart from nuclear rotation, apparent
Brownian motion ofchromosomes within thenucleus hasnotpreviously been reported
(Cremer etal., 1982; DeBoni andMintz, 1986; Shelby etal.,1996). The small
magnitude ofthediffusion constants measured here, together with thefactthatchromatin
diffusion isconstrained insome cases, predicts that thediffusive motion weobserve is
unlikely tobenoticed unless explicitly tested for,using thetype ofanalysis employed
here. Indeed, onerecent paper used acentromere-localized GFP fusion protein and
concluded thatBrownian motion ofthecentromeres was nottaking place (Shelby etal
1996), but infacttheir dataappeared very similar tothat inFigure 2A,and itmay well be
that ifthey had infactplotted themean-squared change inposition versus time interval,
rather than position versus time, asimilar constrained diffusion might have been
observed.
Wealso note thatseveral studies have used time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy
tostudy chromatin motion onavery short time scale. Notably, Selvin etal(1990) have
used time-resolved polarized fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (ameasure of
rotational diffusion) tomeasure thesmall-scale motion ofchromatin onthemillisecond
time scale inintact isolated nuclei, with theresult thatunder physiological conditions,
very little movement wasobserved. However, wenote thatthese spectroscopic methods
employ amuch faster time-scale than theparticle-tracking method employed byus. Itis
very difficult topredict thediffusive behavior ononetime-scale from thebehavior
measured onavastly different time-scale. This does, however, provide acautionary note:
theresults obtained here only apply toprocesses thatrequire large motions ontheorder
ofamicron. Ourresults make nopredictions regarding therate ofvery small scale
processes such aslooping ofenhancer regions tocontact promotor regions.
Comparison with Other Biological Macromolecules
105These results indicate that chromatin moves with adiffusion constant much lower
than thatpreviously reported forbiological macromolecules. Forproteins Disgenerally
around 10–6 cm2/s inaqueous solution and10-8 to10-7 cm2/s incytoplasm (Luby
Phelps etal.,1985). This difference is,ofcourse, tobeexpected given thevastly greater
size ofthechromosome polymer. Chromatin alsodiffuses more slowly than DNA in
dilute solution, forwhich Dranges from 10-8 to10-9cm2/s forDNA 4-300 kbinlength
(Smith etal.,1996). This result was notobvious apriori, since presumably interphase
chromatin ismore compact than naked DNA andthus itsintrinsic diffusion constant
should behigher. Presumably themore tangled conditions inthenucleus lead tothe
vastly decreased motion that isobserved.
Comparison With Predictions From Polymer Dynamics
Having characterized chromatin motion asdiffusive, weconsider how thediffusion
constant compares with thatexpected foralarge polymer undergoing thermal motion in
freesolution (Doi andEdwards, 1986), Dfree =0.2kT/mR where kT=4x10-14 ergs at
room temperature, mistheviscosity, and R is theaverage end-to-end length ofthe
polymer. FortheCEN plasmid, because theLacoperator array constitutes themajority
oftheDNA, weapproximate theend-to-end length Rastheradius oftheobserved GFP
signal. TheGFP signal radius islessthan 0.5pum, sotaking thisasanupper bound onR
yields alower bound forDfree. Nucleoplasm viscosity isreported tobeintherange 1.0-
10.0 cpbased onthediffusion oftracer molecules inthenucleus (Lang etal.,1986;
Fushimi andVerkman, 1991). Weassume areasonable value m=5cF.This gives a
minimum D=3x10-9 cm2/s, three orders ofmagnitude larger than theexperimental
value. This discrepancy isdifficult tomake upwith reasonable changes inRorm,but
canbeexplained ifweconsider thatthechromatin isnotinadilute solution. Aswith
cytoplasmic molecules (Lubh-Phelps etal.,1988), crowding andentanglement will
impede chromatin motion. Ifthechromosome isentangled atnloci, aconservative.
106estimate based onthetheory ofreptation (Grosberg andKhokhlov, 1994) indicates that
thediffusion constant isreduced toDentangled =Dfree/n3/ 2.Webriefly derive this
result here. Weassume chromatin behaves asanideal polymer chain (Van denEngh et
al.,1992). According tothereptation model thesetofentanglements provide obstacles
which delimit atube within which thepolymer diffuses with diffusion constant Dt.The n
entanglement sites divide thechain into nsubchains, each with average radius
Rsubchain=R/(n'2) soeach subchain hasadiffusion constant ofDfreen!/2. Astring of
nsubchains thus diffuses through thetube with adiffusion constant Dt-(1/n)Dfreen!/?
-Dfree/nl/ 2.Thetime forthechain todiffuse outofthetube istº-L2/Dt where the
total contour length ofthetube isL=nRsubchain. During thistime thecenter ofmass of
thepolymer diffuses over adistance R.Hence, Dentangled -R2/tº =R2D/L2 =Di■n
(since L2=n R2). Thus Dentangled -Dfree/n3/2. Amodest number (~20) of
entanglements would slow thediffusion constant bytwoorders ofmagnitude, andmotion
could befurther impeded byother nuclear components. Theobserved magnitude ofDis
thusroughly consistent with thatexpected from Brownian motion. However, thefactthat
azide slightly reduces chromatin motion inyeast (Fig. 2B) may suggest additional
contributions tochromatin motion from active processes. Additionally, thefactthat D
does notnecessarily increase with decreasing chromosome size(Fig. 2C)further suggests
amore complicated picture, although, asdiscussed above, this may simply bea
consequence ofthetethering ofchromatin toasubstrate.
Magnitude oftheDiffusion Constant Relative toRates ofBiological Processes
Ifweassume themagnitude ofDmeasured here forthese particular sites is
representative ofchromatin ingeneral, wecanreconsider thequestion ofwhether ornot
chromatin diffusion isfastenough formotion-requiring processes totake place by
diffusion alone. Aprocess such asmeiotic homolog pairing willgenerally require
chromatin tomove over distances ofseveral microns. Given Dintherange 10-12to10º
º
º
107|1cm2/s, itwould take roughly 1-10 min forchromatin todiffuse 1pum inagiven
direction, which issufficiently fastcompared totheduration ofinterphase (>1.hr) forsuch
process tobeable tooccur viadiffusion. On the other hand, because thisdiffusion time
isslow relative tothetime-scale ofmost molecular interactions, diffusion islikely tobe
rate-limiting inthese processes.
Implications ofConstrained Diffusion
The factthatchromatin diffusion isconstrained (Fig. 2B)hasstrong implications for
processes involving motion. Fortwo loci tointeract, their confinement regions must
overlap, otherwise theinteraction will beprevented because theloci will never be
sufficiently close. On the other hand, iftheconfinement regions oftwoloci dooverlap,
thefrequency ofcollisions between thelociwillactually behigher than ifthelociwere
unconfined, because they areforced toremain inthesame general vicinity. Thus, in
cases ofconstrained diffusion, nuclear architecture (i.e. where alocus ispositioned inthe
nucleus) isofparamount importance andwilldetermine whether aparticular interaction
canorcannot occur. Moreover, thediffusional constraint observed inyeast provides the
firstdirect evidence thatchromatin isanchored toarelatively immobile superstructure in
vivo. Whether thisanchoring structure isthenuclear envelope orsome internal nuclear
matrix will bethesubject offuture investigation.
Conclusions
The picture thus emerges thatinterphase chromatin isable todiffuse within the
nucleus, butonly toalimited extent. Theresult that agiven locus may notbefree to
explore theentire nucleus isconsistent with ourrecent studies ofnuclear positioning in
interphase which indicated that for42different lociexamined, each wasconsistently
found inapproximately thesame position inallnuclei, andthisreproducible nuclear
position waslocus-specific (Marshall etal.,1996). The present work indicates thats
º
:
108within itsregion oflocalization, thechromosome locus isnevertheless able toundergo
Substantial diffusive motion.
These studies illustrate thepower ofquantitative motion analysis fortime-lapse three
dimensional microscopic data. This approach ofinferring mechanistic behavior from
analysis ofthree dimensional motion should beapplicable toabroad range ofproblems
incellbiology.

114 tºChapter 4.Chromosome mechanics invivo: quantitative analysis of
biological structure and motion infour dimensions
Summary
Mitosis isanessentially mechanical process, andforthisreason weneed tounderstand
themechanical properties ofthecomponents involved ifwearetounderstand the
mechanism ofchromosome segregation andcelldivision. Ideally, wewould like away to
measure themechanical properties ofspindle components andchromosomes ina
noninvasive way inside living cells. Tothis end, wehave developed asuite of
computational tools forvisualization andanalysis ofmotion infour dimensions, from
which anumber ofimportant mechanical properties ofthesystem canbededuced based
solely ontime-lapse 3Dmicroscopic imaging.
Recent developments inmicroscopy have made theacquisition ofsuch four
dimensional (three-dimensions asafunction oftime) image data aroutine process.
However, thevastquantities ofdataincluded inthese fourdimensional image series leads
toageneral need formethods toanalyze thedata andrapidly extract useful information
without becoming overwhelmed. Inparticular, direct visual examination oftime lapse 3D
data rarely provides much information, since theimages arecomplicated andconstantly
changing. Clearly acomputational approach iscalled for. Here wepresent amodel-based
nonrigid motion estimation algorithm fortracking themotion ofchromosomes invivo. We
then present aseries ofcomputational tools forextracting information about chromosome
mechanics from themotion data. These tools arethen applied totheprometaphase
congression ofchromosomes intheDrosophila embryo. Wedemonstrate that
chromosomes approach themetaphase plate inadirection perpendicular tothelong axis of
thechromosomes, andthemotion issometimes ledbythekinetochores, andsometimes by
115thearms, asiftheforces exerted bythepolar ejection force andthose exerted atthe
kinetochore areroughly equivalent.
INTRODUCTION
Two recent trends inmicroscopy point towards theneed forcomputational analysis of
motion ofcellular structures. One major trend istheuseofmicroscopy andoptical
techniques tostudy themechanics ofcells. Forexample, diffusion offluorescent tracer
molecules hasbeen used toprobe thepore sizeofthecytoskeletal protein network (Luby
Phelps etal.,1988). Another example isthemeasurement ofmicrotubule flexibilty from
thefluctuations ofmicrotubule shape images (Gittes etal.,1993). These approaches are
gradually leading toanunderstanding ofcytomechanics insome detail, butonecrucial
aspect hasforthemost part been missing, namely, thedirect measurement ofthe
mechanical behavior ofcellular structures in3Dinvivo. Thesecond important trend in
microscopy hasbeen theincreasing useoftime-lapse three-dimensional imaging tostudy
thebehavior ofliving cells (Thomas etal.,1996). These four-dimensional (three spatial
dimensions plus time) microscopy methods lead toalarge volume ofdata from which
meaningful conclusions must bedrawn. One ofthemost obvious applications offour
dimensional imaging liesinthemechanics ofcellular structures. Thekey istorealize that
themotion andconformational dynamics ofcellular components reflects their mechanical
properties andtheforces acting upon them. Inorder toexploit thisconnection, andthus
combine thetwin technological developments ofinvivo cytomechanics andfour
dimensional imaging, weneed amethodology that will allow properties ofcellular
structures that arerelevant tocytomechanics (such asflexibility, mobility, etc) tobe
extracted from complex four-dimensional datasets. Ultimately wewould likesuch tools to
beverygeneral, capable ofanalysis ofmembrane-bound vesicles, protein filaments such as
microtubules, chromosomes, mitochondria, and soforth. This overarching goal will
116involve amajor development effort intheareas ofcomputer vision, visualization, and
computational geometry. Asafirst step inthisdirection, wehave developed atoolkit of
algorithms forthemeasurement andanalysis ofchromosome motion. Many ofthese tools
could, ofcourse, beapplied toother cellular structures aswell. Inorder tomaintain agoal
oriented focus inthiswork, wehave geared thesuite ofanalysis tools towards theaimof
measuring chromosome mechanics during prometaphase congression.
Amajor question incellbiology ishow does thespindle position chromosomes onthe
metaphase plate. This process clearly involves aninterplay between forces applied directly
atthekinetochore andforces exerted along thechromosome arms bythepolar ejection
force. This polar ejection force refers toatendency forchromosomes orchromosome
fragments toedriven away from thespindle poles. Onemodel forthepolar ejection force is
that thechromosomes arepushed bypolymerizing microtubules “like aknight being
repelled byalance” (Murray andHunt, 1994). Another possibility, however, isthat
microtubule motor proteins localizing tothechromosome arms cause thearms tomove
along non-kinetochore microtubules (Afshar etal.,1995). Atanyrate, thekinetochore
forces andthepolar ejection forces together result inproper alignment ofthechromosome
inmetaphase. Asourinitial goal wethus seek toanalyze themechanical features ofthe
polar ejection force indirectly byvisualizing itseffect onchromosomes. Ineffect, wewish
tousethemotion ofchromosomes asanindicator oftheforces acting onthem, just as
aeronautical engineers usedustparticles tovisualize theflow ofairaround anairplane wing
inawind tunnel. Drosophila isaparticularly useful system inthisregard because its
chromosome arerelatively long andflexible, unlike those ofvertebrates which areshort
rigid rods. Asaconsequence ofthehigher chromosome flexibility inDrosophila,
differences inforce (such asthatapplied atthekinetochore versus thatapplied bythepolar
ejection force) will result inmore pronounced bending ofthechromosome. Thus in
principle, changes inchromosome shape willreflect changes inapplied forces. Finally,
Drosophila prometaphase isinteresting from thepoint ofview ofnuclear architecture
117because thechromosomes assume averycharacteristic arrangement, inwhich therelatively
straight chromosomes form abundle oriented perpendicularly tothespindle axis. This is
oneofmany examples ofchromsomes forming areproducibly specific arrangement, and it
ishoped thatbystudying themotion ofthechromosomes asthey attain thisconfiguration,
wecangain insight into themechanism bywhich specialized chromosome arrangements
areformed. Forthese reason, wedesired tostudy theconformational dynamics of
Drosophila embryo chromosomes asthey congressed tothemetaphase plate. Specifically,
wewould like todetermine whether kinetochores orarms lead themotion towards the
plate, and trytousetheshape ofthechromosomes during congression toindirectly
measure therelative forces exerted atthekinetochore and theforces exerted onthearms.
There isalready aprecedent forthisapproach. Careful analysis ofchromosome motion
during prometaphase andmetaphase innewt lung epithelial cells hasrevealed periodic
oscillations inkinetochore movement along thespindle, which hasimportant implications
forspindle-chromosome interactions (Skibbens etal.,1993). However, unlike newt lung
cellchromosomes, chromosomes intheDrosophila embryo arenotconfined toasingle
plane, therefore 3Dmotion analysis methods arerequired. Furthermore, because
visualization ofDrosophila chromosomes in3Disaslow process compared with video
DIC microscopy, themotion tracking method must beable tocope with limited temporal
resolution, which isaformidable problem. Our labhaspreviously developed thehigh
speed high-resolution low-light three-dimensional fluorescence imaging system required to
collect time-lapse 3Dimages ofcongressing Drosophila chromosomes, aswell asasuite of
image processing andvisualization tools toimprove image contrast andcompensate for
image degradation due tooptics andtonoise. Methods tomodel andanalyze thethree
dimensional conformation ofchromosomes have alsobeen thefocus ofpastdevelopment
efforts. This chapter focusses onthenext step, theanalysis ofchromosome motion from
time-lapse 3Dfluorescence images.
118Tracking themotion ofnonrigid objects from aseries ofimages isanontrivial image
processing problem and iscurrently thesubject ofresearch bymany groups. Wepresent a
model-based motion estimation scheme fortracking nonrigid 3Dmotion under conditions
oflimited temporal resolution. Wepresent ascheme forusing themotion estimate to
deduce mechanical properties ofchromosomes, such asflexibility, andfortracking the
trajectories ofspecific regions onachromosome. Wefurther present algorithms for
extracting thecomponent ofmotion parallel tothemitotic spindle andpresent preliminary
results obtained from metaphase chromosomes inliving Drosophila embryos.
Materials and Methods
injection ofembryos
Both wild-type (Oregon-R) flies andflieshomozygous fortheItº13translocation
(Wakimoto and Hearn, 1990) were used forthis study. InItx13 theleftarm of
chromosome 2istranslocated onto theright armofchromosome 3,resulting inonearm
that istwice aslong astheothers. This allows identification ofoneparticular chromosome
arm inimages ofliving embryos, which ordinarily isimpossible because allarms are
approximately thesame length. Oregon-R embryos were collected from population cages
oncornmeal-agar plates. Itº13Embryos were collected from bottles using miniature
cornmeal plates made bymelting cornmeal-agar media andpouring into thelidsofsmall
plastic petri dishes. Scratches were made onthesurface ofthecornmeal-agar after cooling,
toencourage egg-laying. After collecting for30minutes from cages or 1hour from
bottles, embryos were bleach dechorionated, mounted ona22x35 #1.5 coverslip with
double-stick tape glue dissolved inheptane, anddesiccated for13minutes inasealed
chamber with Dri-Rite desiccant. During dessication embryos were observed toavoid
over-drying. Embryos were then overlaid with halocarbon oilandinjected either withCy5
labelled histone protein (agiftofMichael Paddy, University ofFlorida) orwith asolution
oftheDNA dyeOliGreen (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) diluted 20-fold inPBS
119(use ofOliGreen asaninvivo chromosome stain inDrosophila embryos was first
demonstrated byWilliam Theurkauf, SUNY Stony Brook). Ourprevious studies of
chromosome motion have employed directly labeled histones, butOliGreen hasthe
advantage that itiscommercially available andrelatively cheap. Because itisasmall
molecule, theinjection solution hasalowviscosity anddoes notform precipitates, sothat
theneedles have good flow andnever clog even when many embryos areinjected.
However, OliGreen tends toproduce ahigher background fluorescence than labelled
histones, and soforthehighest quality images wewere forced torely onCy5 labelled
histones. Because Cy5fluorescence emits light intheinfrared region ofthespectrum itis
notvisible totheeye, and soweadded asmall ammount ofOliGreen totheinjection
mixture, allowing visual identification ofnuclei. After locating anembryo about toenter
mitosis (this can bedetermined bynoting anincrease inthegranularity ofthenuclear
chromatin signal) using theeyepieces ofthemicroscope, allsubsequent steps were carried
outbyusing theCCD camera todetect theCy5fluorescence.
four dimensional fluorescence wide-field microscopy
Following injection, embryos were imaged onawide-field epifluorescence microscope
inwhich allfilter wheels, shutters, andstage motion areunder computer controlº. The
excitation light source was amercury arclamp coupled tothemicroscope byafiber-optic
light scrambler togive uniform illumination accross theentire field. This type ofwide-field
imaging isextremely advantageous forinvivo 3Dimaging, because unlike inaconfocal
microscope where 90% ofthephotons emitted bythesample arerejected bythepinhole,
andanother 90% failtoberegistered bythephotomultiplier tube duetotheinherently low
quantum efficiency ofthePMT, inthewide-field system essentially alltheemitted photons
arerecorded because there isnopinhole andthedetector, acooled scientific grade CCD
camera, has avery high quantum efficiency, ontheorder to90%. Thus, amercury lamp
canbeused asalight source rather than themuch brighter laser sources used inconfocal.
120The useofthelowexcitation intensity ofthemercury lamp appears essential forkeeping
theembryos alive during theimaging process, toavoid concerns about photodamage
induced artifacts. Imaging wasdone through a60xN.A. 1.4oilimmersion lens using
1.5180 oil. 256x256 pixel images were collected ateach focal position bytheCCD
camera, using afilterset anddichroic mirror optimized forFITC, andoptical sectioning was
performed bystepping thestage in0.5pumincrements. Thepixel size with thissetup is
0.11 17x0.1117 x0.5pum. Ateach focal plane, a0.5second exposure wascollected.
After 18sections were collected, thestage was moved back 9.0mm andtheprocess
repeated. With thisarrangement, ourcurrent temporal resolution isone256x256x18 three
dimensional dataset every 25seconds. Thetime resolution islimited primarily byexposure
time andtime required tomove thestage from oneposition tothenext. Thetotal overhead
time required toread outanimage from theCCD, convert theanalog charge todigital
values, write these values onto thehard drive, andmove thestage by0.5pum, was 1.8
seconds. Taking smaller images (128x128 pixel) does notsubstantially increase data
collection rate, andgreatly increases thechances that anucleus willdrift outofthefield of
view before data collection isfinished. Following data collection, outoffocus blur is
removed bythree-dimensional constrained iterative deconvolution.6 using anempirically
measured point spread function. Projections offoursuccessive time-points from such a4D
dataset isgiven infigure 4.1. Neither theOliGreen northeimaging process were
damaging totheembryos: of15embryos injected, 14,including theembryo used forthe
analysis presented here, developed normally intolarvae. These survival rates arethesame
asthose forembryos injected with buffer alone. Moreover, during imaging, synchronized
nuclear divisions occur attheappropriate rateandwithout anygross abnormalities, such as
anaphase bridges, which would bediagnostic ofDNA damage. Wenote thatdespite the
fact that several labs useconfocal microscopy toimage chromosomes inDrosophila
embryos, none have been able tokeep theembryos alive during theimaging process. This
islikely duetotheextremely high intensity ofthelaser light needed intheconfocal setup.

123image processing
After imaging anddeconvolution, images were further processed bymedian filtering.
Amedian filter isanalgorithm thatreplaces thevalue ofeach pixel with themedian
intensity ina3x3 or5x5 box ofpixels surrounding thepixel inquestion. This ismost
useful forremoving “salt andpepper” noise, inwhich theimage iscorrupted byscattered
bright and ordark intensity spikes. This type ofnoise ischaracteristic ofthephoton
statistical noise which isthedominant noise source inlowlight imaging. Another type of
noise common inlow-light imaging isquantization noise due tothefactthat theentire
inensity range ofthesample may besolow astoend upbeing mapped bytheA/D
converter onto arelatively fewdiscrete digital values. This results inagrainy image. To
reduce quantization noise, weemploy ananalog amplifier prior totheA/Dconverter thus
expanding thedynamic range ofthesignal prior toquantization, inorder tospread the
inensity range ofthesignal over more digital levels, thusmaking asmoother image. One
other type ofimage degradation needs tobediscussed: motion blurring. When taking an
image ofamoving object, iftheobject moves significantly during theacquisition time ofa
single image, itwillproduce ablurred image onthecamera. Based ontheestimates of
rigid body motion discussed below, theoverall translational displacement ofthenuclei is
ontheorder 0.2plmbetween successive 24second time points. This then predicts that
during a0.5second exposure, thenucleus will move approximately 0.04 pum, which is
significantly less than thesize ofonepixel (0.1117 inxand y),thus there will be
essentially nomotion blurring.
Results
Optical flow algorithms cannot track moving chromosomes
Initial attempts totrack themotion ofDrosophila prometaphase chromosomes employed
theBlock-Matching optical flow algorithm (Haralick andShapiro, 1993), astandard*
y
s
124motion estimation algorithm commonly employed inthecomputer vision field. Inblock
matching, theimage isdivided intosmall blocks ofpixels, (tests onDrosophila used blocks
ranging from 5x5x3 to21x21x5 pixels). Then foreach box, asearch isdone toseewhich
block intheimage attime t-1bestmatches, pixel bypixel, thecurrent block attime t.The
relative spatial offset ofthebest-matching box attime t-1relative tothebox attime t
specifies themotion estimate forthecenter ofthebox attime t.Block-matching type
optical flow algorithms have been employed totrack themovements ofcells during
Dictystelium development (Awasthi etal.,1994; Doolittle etal.,1995). Because the
nonrigidity ofchromosomes will allow chromosome segments torotate andpossible
stretch, wealsotested avariant ofthisapproach inwhich thebox isallowed toundergo a
general affine transformation (which allows, inaddition totranslation, theadditional
operations ofrotation, magnification, andshear) inorder tofind thebestmatch (Fuh and
Maragos, 1991). When theresults ofthese analyses were compared with theactual
images, itwasfound that themotion vectors produced didnotcorrespond tothemotion
that was visually apparent. Forexample, frequently neighboring points onthesame
chromosome arm attime twould bemapped onto wildly disparate points onseparate arms
attime t--1. The failure oftheblock matching approach isdue toawell-known flaw in
block matching andallother local optical flow algorithms, which iscalled the“Aperture
Problem”. The aperture problem stems from thefactthat weareexamining asmall
window ofdata andtrying tocompare itwith similar small windows inthenewimage. If
thiswindow ofdata istoosmall, then there will beagreat many possible matches attime
t+1. This isparticularly true inourcase, where asmall region ofachromosome willlook
basically thesame asanyother small region, thus generating many false matches and
making block matching impossible. If,ontheother hand, thewindow ofdata istaken so
large that itcontains ameaningful pattern that will notgenerate many false matches,
chances areitcontains portions ofmore than onechromosome, which aremoving relative
toeach other, andsotheresulting bestmatch may notreflect themotion ofanyindividual2.
.
12.5chromosomes. Moreover, fornonrigid objects likeDrosophila chromosomes, theshape of
thesegment within thebox islikely tochange somuch astomake adirect match
impossible. Thus block matching was notaviable method fortracking prometaphase
chromosome motion inDrosophila, andindeed Ishould have known from theoutset that
thiswould bethecase (D.Agard, percomm.).
The problem with block matching canbest besummed upbysaying that small
windows ofdata donotcontain enough information todetermine themotion intheimage,
while large windows ofdata areunlikely toremain even approximately constant due to
nonrigidity andlimited temporal resolution. This does nothowever mean thatmotion
estimation isimpossible. Aswith many machine vision tasks, specific apriori knowledge
about theobjects canbeused toassist themotion estimation process. Inthiscase, we
know thatchromosomes areconnected curve-like objects which donotbreak apart during
mitosis. The keytochromosome motion analysis then istofind away totakeadvantage of
thisknowledge.
Model-based nonrigid motion estimation
Most published cases ofmotion esimation algorithms which make useofapriori
information arebased ontheassumption thattheobject moving isarigid body andhence
itsmotion canbedescribed asacomposition ofasimple translation and asimple rotation.
Estimation ofthemotion ofnonrigid objects, such aschromosomes, ismuch lesscommon.
Inthiscase, wecannot rely onabsolute rigidity asanassumption, butwecanmake
assumptions about connectivity. Inother words, while neighboring points need notremain
atafixed relative position asinarigid body, initially connected points must atthevery least
remain connected. Inorder toincorporate connectivity information into themotion
estimation process, wefirstrepresent thechromosome configuration asagraph, inwhich
vertices represent points onachromosome arm, andedges represent continuous stretches
ofchromatin connecting neighboring points. This graph representation isbuilt by
126interactively picking andconnecting object points within a3Dimage, forming asetof
wireframe models (Mathog, 1985) forthechromosomes. This interactive modelling is
done using acustom interactive modelling package developed inourlabbyDiana Hughes.
Inthissystem, theobject isdisplayed inseveral different orientations along with adisplay
ofthecurrent wireframe model, andtheuser clicks themouse onvarious points inthe
images tospecify locations along thechromosome arms, andthemodel isautomatically
updated asisthecursor position intheother viewing orientations. Thewireframe models
represent thearm asasetofpositions versus length along thearm. Length along anarm is
specified such thattelomeres areatthebeginning ofthearm(length=0) andcentromeres are
attheend. Unambiguous identification ofcentromeres andtelomeres ispossible in
metaphase because thecentromeres cluster toform themetaphase plate while telomeres
protrude outinto thecytoplasm. Figure 4.2illustrates thechromosome models obtained
foronenucleus, forseveral successive time points. From thisdata itisalready clear that
there isconsiderable motion from onetime point tothenext. Itisalso clear that itis
difficult tovisually determine which chromosome corresponds towhich between
successive time points.
Once agraph isobtained foreach time-point, themotion estimation problem becomes a
graph-matching problem, inwhich weseek anoptimal mapping ofelements ofthegraph at
time tonto elements ofthegraph attime t3-1. Because vertices arechosen manually, their
number andpositioning along anarmarearbitrary andunlikely tobeconsistent from one
time point tothenext. Therefore, attempting tomatch vertices onto vertices is
problematical. Forthisreason, wehave instead chosen tofirstlocate entire chromosomes
within thegraph andthen setupamapping between chromosomes, thus imposing a
topological constraint thatconnected points remain connected under themapping. Inthis
implementation achromosome isdefined asasimple path inwhich allvertices have degree
2except thefirst andlastvertices. Because theDrosophila embryo chromosomes at
metaphase aresimple linear unbranched chromosomes, thissimple definition issufficient.

piecewise linear curve in3space formed bytheunion oflinesegments connecting adjacent

Solution ofmotion estimation problem bysimulated annealing
Thegraph matching problem thusbecomes thatoffinding ftominimize D.Because
there aremany possible mappings f,some attention must begiven tothealgorithm for
finding theoptimal ftominimize D.Generally, onewould likeanalgorithm forfinding an
exact solution toruninpolynomial time, that is,thetime taken tofind asolution should be
bounded bysome polynomial function ofthesize oftheproblem. Ifapolynomial time
algorithm forfinding thesolution does notexist, then itisgenerally better tofind an
approximation algorithm thatcanfind asolution insome reasonable time atthecost ofnot
quite getting theexact optimum. Does apolynomial time algorithm exist forgraph
matchine? Itturns outthat thegraph matching problem isNPcomplete. The term NP
complete describes asetofproblems, which includes thefamous Travelling Salesman
133Problem, such thatanyNPproblem canbeconverted intoanyother NPcomplete problem
byanalgorithm which runs inpolynomial time. Soifany one NPcomplete problem can
besolved, thesame method canbeused tosolve anyother NPcomplete problem. What
makes thissetofproblems interesting, however, isthat nopolynomial-time algorithm has
ever been found foranyNP-complete problem. Itisgenerally assumed that nosuch
polynomial time solutions exist forthese problems, oratthevery least, considering the
time invested bymany experts inseeking such asolution, itisclearly notworth attempting
tofindone. Thus, weseek instead anapproximation algorithm tofind theapproximately
optimal mapping. Wetherefore findtheoptimal mapping ftominimize Dusing simulated
annealing (Press etal.,1989), which isastandard approach tosolve large NPcomplete
combinatorial optimization problems.
Insimulated annealing, arandom solution isinitially generated, andthen random
changes aremade tothesolution soastomimic therandom motions thatoccur when a
metal cools slowly (aprocess known asannealing). Theadvantages ofsimulated annealing
arethat itcanavoid local minima thatmight trapother minimization schemes, and itcanbe
applied toapurely combinatorial minimization inwhich thesolution space isasetof
discrete states rather than anumerical value forsome parameter. Simulated annealing has
been used byother groups insolving motion estimation problems in2D(Dubois and
Konrad, 1993), although their approach differs from ours inthat itisfundamentally an
optical flow scheme andnotmodel-based. Ourimplementation proceeds asfollows. After
locating allchromosomes, andcomputing allpairwise distances between arms attime tand
arms attime t-1using equation 3,fisinitialized toarandom mapping. Thetransition
operation used togenerate new candidate solutions within thesimulated annealing
algorithm isaswapping operation, inwhich given acurrent mapping, twochromosomes ai
andajarechosen atrandom. Ifaimaps onto bi=f(ai) andajmaps onto bi=f(aj), the
swapping operation generates anewmapping where aimaps onto biandajmaps onto bi.
Using thisswapping operation togenerate newcandidate solutions, andthecostfunction
134ofeqn4toevaluate thecost ofeach mapping, simulated annealing isthenperformed using
theMetropolis algorithm (Press etal.,1989) asfollows. Iftheswapping operation would
result inalower value forD,then that swap isperformed and themapping updated
accordingly. However, iftheswap under consideration would lead toanincreased value
forD,then theswap isperformed conditionally, with probability Pgiven by:
P=e(-AD/A) (5)
where ADisthe(positive) change inDfortheswap and Aisacontrol parameter thatstarts
out atavery high value, greater than themaximum possible AD, such that allswaps
proposed areautomatically taken with probability very close to1.Thepurpose ofthis
probalistic update istohelp thealgorithm jump outoflocal minima asthesolution
gradually searches foraglobal minimum. Aisgradually reduced inmultiplicative steps as
theminimization proceeds. Inourimplementation, Aisreduced byafactor of0.95
whenever afixed number ofsuccessful swaps have been made orwhen alarger fixed
number ofswaps have been attempted. Thealgorithm terminates when Dfails todecrease
foralarge, fixed number ofattempted swaps, orwhen afixed total number ofchanges inA
have taken place. Wenote thatwhile theuseofsimulated annealing allows thisalgorithm
tobeapplied todatasets with alarge number ofchromosomes, oreven partially traced
fragments ofchromosomes, itisprobably overkill inthecase ofanormal Drosophila
embryo which has adiploid complement ofonly 12chromosome arms (wetrack arms,
rather than entire chromosomes, because sometimes itisdifficult todetermine the
connectivity atthecentrosomal region during laterprometaphase. Inprinciple themotion
estimate canitself beused toresolve ambiguities inconnectivity, asdiscussed below, but
thishasnotyetbeen implemented). The total number ofways tomap 12arms onto 12
arms is12!(twelve factorial) which isequal to479,001,600 which though alarge number,
isnotsolarge astoprohibit directly computing allpossible solutions. However, forcasesc
135with more chromosomes abrute-force evaluation ofallsolutions isimpossible. For
example, inyeast with 16chromosomes there areapproximately 1013 possible mappings.
If,asavery conservative estimate, ittakes tenclock cycles ona200MHz machine to
evaluate onemapping, itwould take over three years tocheck allsolutions. Inthiscase,
simulated annealing becomes essential. Simulated annealing allows theproblem tobe
solved because itmakes atradeoff: itfinds avery good approximate solution ina
reasonable time scale butattheexpense ofoccasional errors.
Once themapping (f)ofchromosomes attime tonto chromosomes attime t--1isfound,
themapping ofpoints onchromosome aonto points onchromosome f(a) isfound by
uniformly mapping each point onchromosome aonto thecorresponding point on
chromosome f(a), taking intoaccount therelative orientation (fig. 4.3). This mapping is
thefinal motion estimate, which indicates thedisplacement experienced byanygiven point.
When theindividual motion vectors forselected points areplotted, they generally agree
with thevisually observed motion. Forthewireframe data infigure 4.2,themappings at
each time interval were checked with those determined bycareful visual examination ofthe
data, andgenerally agreed except incases where thevisual analysis did not reveal an
obvious solution. Thus, thesimulated annealing algorithm does aswell as,orbetter than,
tedious visual examination ofthechromosome images. Theautomated algorithm hasthe
advantage that itcantake intoaccount allarms simultaneously, rather than justlooking at
onepair ofarms atatime, asavisual examination must.
Given themotion estimate, wecandetermine thetrajectory ofanygiven point. Starting
with thepoint attime t-0, wedetermine from themotion estimate thepoint att=1onto
which thecurrent point maps. The coordinates ofthispoint arestored, andthen the
corresponding point att=2 isfound. This isrepeated until theposition ofthepoint has
been tracked foralltime intervals.
136Rigid body motion compensation
Because weareprimarily interested insmall-scale motion ofindividual chromosomes,
weseek toremove theeffects ofoverall motion ofthenucleus asawhole. Rotational
spinning ofnuclei within living cells hasbeen extensively documented inother celltypes
(DeBoni andMintz, 1986; Paddock andAlbrecht-Buehler, 1988). Inaddition, during
embryogenesis inDrosophila melanogaster, theentire embryo pulsates with aconstant
series ofactin-myosin driven contractions which cause thenuclei towash back andforth
within thesyncytium. This constant flowing ofnuclei produces both translational and
rotation motion ofthenuclei. Taken together, these overall motions willdominate the
observed motion foragiven chromosome, thusobscuring theconformation motion ofthe
chromosomes themselves. Thus, inorder toextract only thelocal conformations ofthe
chromosomes wemust first estimate theoverall rigid body motion (ie.rotation plus
translation) inthree dimensions, andthen correct forthese motions.
Theoverall translation ofthenucleus isfound bycomputing, foreach time interval, the
average displacement vector <Ar-t. Thedisplacement vector forasingle point issimply
computed bytaking theposition ofeach point attime t3-1andsubtracting from itthe
position ofthecorresponding point attime t.Inorder tofind asetofpoints forcomputing
thisaverage, weresample each arm attime tin0.1pumintervals andthen uniformly map
these points onto corresponding points oncorresponding arms attime t--1. Wethen take
theaverage ofthisdisplacement vector over thissetofpoints. Once wehave estimated the
average translational displacement vector foreach time interval, wethen usethisestimate to
compensate forthetranslation motion. Suppose atotal ofTtime points, sothatt=1...T. To
thelasttime point, weapply nodisplacement, since there isnotranslation estimate available
(since there isnodata forT+1). Tothesecond tolasttime point, t-T-1, weadd tothe
position ofeach point thesingle displacement vector <Ar-T-1 which thus puts thesecond
tolasttime point intothesame translation frame ofreference asthelasttime point. For
t=T-2, weapply toeach point atotal displacement <Ar-T_2 +3\r-T-1 which again putss
C
1.37thedata attime T-2into thesame frame ofreference asthedata oftime T.Thus forany
time point t,wesum thedisplacement vectors <Ar-t +-Ar-tº-1 +...+ 3Ar-T and add
thetotal offset tothepoints attime t,inorder togenerate anew setofpoints that is
translationally fixed with respect tothefinal time point. Wethus remove thetranslational
component oftheoverall nuclear motion.
Wenow seek toperform asimilar compensation fortherotational motion. Given aset
ofpoints attime t,and asetofcorresponding points attime t-1(asdescribed above for
translational motion), therotation matrix which results inaleast-squares alignment ofthe
two sets ofcorresponding point iscomputed using asingular-value decomposition method
described byKanatani (Kanatani, 1993). Westart with sets ofpoints forwhich
translational motion hasalready been compensated. Wehave foreach time interval two
sets ofpoints specified bytheposition vectors riattime tandr’iattime t3-1, where i
ranges over allresampled points onallarms (letthetotal number ofpoints beN).Thegoal
istofind therotational motion which brings these two sets ofpoints into theclosest
correspondence. Therotational motion willbespecified byarotation matrix R.Arotation
matrix isa3x3orthogonal matrix with determinant 1,which represents arotation such that
given thethree dimensional position vector rofsome point, thenewposition vector after
therotation becomes r"=Rr. Ourgoal isthus tofind thenine elements ofRwhich best
map thepoints rionto thepoints r'i.Because weareconcerned with rotational motion, we
replace each point riwith thecorresponding unitvector mi,andnow askfortherotation
matrix Rwhich best maps mionto m'i. Weformulate this asaleast squares problem,
where wedefine theoptimal Rasthatwhich minimizes e”thetotal Squared distance after

Because thefirstandlastterms donotdepend onR,wefindthattominimize e2weneed to
maximize thequantity tr(RTK) where Kisthecorrelation matrix (whose value can be
directly found from theknown points) given by:

Thefirst step tomaximize r(RTK) istocarry outasingular value decomposition (Press et

139where o1,02, and O2arethesingular values. Standard algorithms exist tofind U,Vand

because itcanbeproven that ismaximized when

R=V| 1º(11) det(VUT)
This solution isunique ifKisrank greater than 1anddet(VUT)=1. Both ofthese
uniqueness criteria areevaluated bytheprogram, andwere found tohold forchromosome
data. Indeed, theease with which uniqueness ofthesolution canbedemonstrated isa
major advantage ofthesingular value decomposition approach (Kanatani, 1993). Thus, at
each time point tweend upwith therotation matrix Rtthatbestdescribes theobserved
motion. This allows ustocompensate fortherotational motion ofthenuclei. Ateach time
point t,weapply toallpoints acomposite rotation matrix given by:
T-1
Rcomp(t)= TIRt (12)
t=1
That is,weapply toeach time point allsuccessive rotation matrices such thatthepoints end
upinaframe ofreference rotationally fixed relative tothatofthelasttime point. Once we
have done this, thefinal result isasetofchromosome models forwhich there isnooverall
nuclear translation orrotation, andtheonly remaining motion isdue tomotion ofone
chromosome relative toanother, and totheconformational flexibilty ofthechromosomes
themselves. Itisthis revised setofchromosome models that will beused for all
Subsequent analysis.
14 0Therotational motion estimation isalso ofintrinsic interest, inlight ofthemany
published reports thatnuclei invivo undergo persistent spinning motion (DeBoni and
Mintz, 1986; Paddock andAlbrecht-Buehler, 1988). When thetime-lapse 3Dimages of
Drosophila chromosomes areviewed asatime-lapse movie ofstereo pairs, itoften appears
thatthenuclear arerotating, butdespite careful examination ofthese movies itwasnever
possible tosayforsure what direction they were rotating, orabout what axis, orindeed to
distinguish between spinning androcking back andforth. Rocking motions back andforth
could simply beanoptical illusion, acase where several small random motion arepercieved
asasingle coherent motion. However, ifindeed thechromosome complement isspinning
around during mitosis thatwould suggest avery unusual activity ofthespindle. Inorder to
resolve thisissue, weturn totherotational motion estimate described above. Euler's
Theorem (Kanatani, 1993) states thatanyrotation matrix represents arotation about anaxis
bysome angle. That is,any3Drotation canberepresented bysome rotation axis land
some rotation angle Qabout thataxis. Spinning motion, inwhich thenucleus spins around
andaround arelatively constant axis, would bereflected inanaxis lthatdoes notchange
itsorientation very much. On the other hand, rocking back andforth will also entail a
relatively fixed rotation axis lexcept thattheaxis willflipbetween opposite orientations as
thenucleus rocks first inonedirection, then theother. Finally, ifthenucleus isnot
undergoing anypersistent rotation, but isjust tumbling due toturbulent flow ofthe
cytoplasm and orrandom collisions with spindle microtubules, then therotation axis l
should beuncorrelated from onetime interval tothenext, andwillchange atrandom. In
accordance with Eulers theorem, wecancompute landQfrom therotation matrix Rat
each time interval, using thefollowing relations (Kanatani, 1993):
Q=cos-tº-1 (13)

I=N■|R13-R31 (14)
R21-R 12
where Rijarethecomponents ofRandNisthevector normalization operation defined by

When wecarry outthiscomputation forseveral time intervals wegettheresults illustrated
inTable 4.1. Clearly, therotation axis isnot atallconstant, itsorientation not
corresponding atallfrom onetime point tothenext. Thus, weconclude thattheapparent
spinning motion observed intime-lapse movies ofDrosophila embryo chromosomes isin
factjustrandom tumbling. Although this isanegative result, itillustrates thepower of
quantitative motion analysis tounderstand chromosome behavior insituations where direct
visual examination isnotsufficient.

142Tools for analysis ofchromosome mobility
Thesimplest measurement offour-dimensional behavior ischromosome mobility, ie,
how much does agiven point move around throughout thenucleus. Chromosome mobility
isinteresting because ifchromosome areattached toanysortofimmobile superstructure,
forexample thenuclear envelope, itshould bereflected byareduction inchromosome
mobility. Moreover, given theaverage chromosome mobility and aknowledge ofthesize
ofthechromosomes, itisstraightforward tocompute theeffective viscosity ofthe
surrounding nucleopolasm, which should provide important information about thestructure
ofcytoplasm andnucleoplasm. Chromosome mobility iseasily computed astherms
displacement experienced ateach point onanarm, which isstraightforward tocompute
given themotion estimate. Forpoints nearcentromeres, mobility probably reflects mainly
pushing andpulling bythespindle. Forpoints further from centromeres, mobility reflects
both Brownian motion, thepolar ejection force (aforce onchromosome directed away
from thespindle poles, probably due torandom collision with theends ofgrowing
microtubules, seeRieder andSalmon, 1994) andforce transmitted along thechromosome
from thekinetochore. Ascanbeseen infigure 4.4, thetelomeres aregenerally more
mobile than thecentromeres. This implies thattelomeres arenotanchored toanyrigid
structure such asanuclear matrix orresidual nuclear envelope. Analysis ofmobility during
prophase when thenuclear envelope isstillpresent (Hiraoka etal.,1990) iscurrently
underway, and acomparison oftelomere mobility inprophase andmetaphase willbeused
totestforinteractions oftelomeres with thenuclear envelope invivo.

14.5Tools foranalysis ofchromosome conformation infour dimensions
Acomplete motion estimate forafour-dimensional data setisahuge volume of
information, anddirect inspection oftheindividual motion vectors isalmost completely
uninformative. What wereally want isaway toobtain simple measures ofchromosome
behavior from themotion estimate, sothat themechanics andmotion ofthechromosomes
canberepresented insome easily interpretable way. There aredoubtless many ways to
approach thisproblem. Wechose tobuild onprevious work inourlabwhich focused on
ways ofanalyzing three dimensional structure. Mathog etal.(Mathog, 1985) developed a
setofscalar conformation descriptors, which associated with each point onachromosome
wire-frame model some scalar value describing theshape ofthechromosome inthevicinity
ofthatpoint. Oneexample ofsuch ameasure iscurvature. Ourapproach istoextend these
measures todescribe four-dimensional structure, bycomputing thescalar conformation
descriptors forallpoints onallchromosomes atalltime point, andthen taking theroot
mean-squared change inthevalue ofthedescriptor atagiven point over time. Essentially
thisproduces ameasure ofthedegree oftemporal fluctuation in3Dconformation atthe
point inquestion. Thus, taking thecase ofcurvature, bymeasuring thermschange in
curvature wegetameasure offlexibility, andbyplotting thisvalue versus position onthe
chromosome, wecan inprinciple identify regions ofhigher orlower flexibility which could
potentially reflect differences inchromosome structure.
Chromosome flexibility isinteresting initself because different physical models for
how thechromatin ispacked into thechromosome make some predictions about its
flexibility. Flexibility isalso ofintrinsic importance inprocesses thatrequire bending or
looping ofthechromosome. Although chromatin flexibility hasbeen directly measured on
isolated chromosomes (Castro, 1994) thenotorious sensitivity ofchromosome structure to
isolation conditions makes ithighly desirable tomeasure flexibility insitu inliving cells.
146Tools for analysis ofspindle-driven motion
One major application ofmotion analysis isthestudy ofinteractions between
chromosomes and themitotic spindle. These interactions have been shown inother
systems toinclude aperiodic oscillation ofthecentromeres along thespindle axis, andthe
polar ejection force pushing chromosome arms away from thepoles (Rieder andSalmon,
1994). Figure 4.5plots thetrajectories ofcentromeres andtelomeres fortwoarms. From
figure 4.5C itisapparent thatthemotion ofthearms islargely along anaxisperpendicular
tothearms themselves. This implies thatduring metaphase there isnorigid nuclear matrix
which would beexpected toblock such motion. Coordinated motions ofentire arms may
becaused byrandom collision with growing MTends thatpush thewhole armoneway or
theother. Alternatively, themotion may becaused bykinetochore fibers exerting force on
thekinetochore, andtherestofthearm isdragged along passively. Inthelatter case, the
factthatthewhole armmoves inadirection perpendicular toitsaxiswould imply thatthe
chromosome cannot rotate about thepoint ofattachment tothekinetochore microtubules.
We areparticularly interested instudying themotions ofchromosomes during
congression. One model forthismotion would suppose that thekinetochores arethe
dominant motive force, andthey drag thechromosomes behind them. Analternative
though isthatthepolar ejection force acting onthechromosome arms plays asubstantial
role inmoving thechromosomes into thecorrect position onthemetaphase plate. In
principle these canbedistinguished bycarefully examining theshape andmotion ofthe
chromosomes. Drosophila chromosomes have abigadvantage over vertebrate
chromosomes inthat they arelong andflexible, asopposed totheshort rigid rodlike
vertebrate mitotic chromosomes, andthusdifferences inforce acting atdifferent parts ofthe
Drosophila chromosome should produce correspondingly larger differences inshape and
motion. The main prerequisite forthisanalysis istodetermine thecomponent ofthe
motion that isparallel tothespindle axis. Unlike DIC images ofnewt lung cells, in
fluorescence 3Dimages ofchromatin ithasnotbeen possible todirectly visualize the

become roughly collinear, along alineperpendicular tothespindle axis(Hiraoka etal.,
1990). Furthermore, due totheorganization ofmitotic spindles inDrosophila embryos,
themetaphase plate andthespindle axis areroughly coplanar intheX-Y plane. Thus, we
least-squares fitastraight line tothesetof(x,y) positions ofthecentromeres (as
determined bythechromosome armmodels, inwhich, duetothepolarized configuration of
metaphase chromosomes inDrosophila (Hiraoka etal.,1990), thecentromeres areatthe
highest vertical position). Weform aunitvector <vx,vy-> parallel tothisline,andthen use
theperpendicular unitvector <vy,vX- asanestimate ofthespindle axis. Positions ofall
points arethen projected onto thisaxis toobtain aposition along thespindle axis foreach
point. Because thedatasets have been rotationally aligned asdescribed above, itis
reasonable touse thefinal spindle axis asanestimate ofthespindle axis during
congression. Aplotofcentromere andtelomeres position along thespindle axis isgiven in
figure 4.6. While both centromeres andtelomeres aremoving back and forth, the
telomeres donotsimple follow thecentromeres passively. Insome instances, telomeres
andcentromeres aremoving inopposite directions. One goal ofthisanalysis istodetect
oscillations ofthecentromeres such ashave been demonstrated innewt lung epithelial cells
(Skibbens etal.,1993). Figure 4.6does notreveal anyobvious periodicity. However, in
newt cells theperiod ofoscillation isapproximately 100seconds. Given ourtemporal
resolution ofonedataset every 24seconds, such oscillations would bedifficult todetect
because wewould only besampling position four times percycle. One approach to
improve temporal resolution istoacquire smaller datasets which include thecentromere
proximal regions ofthechromosome arms butnotthetelomeric regions. Faster CCD
cameras andoptimized staining procedures may also help reduce exposure time and
increase data rate.×
152Discussion
Wehave presented asetofcomputational tools fortheanalysis ofmotion inthree
dimensions from time-lapse three-dimensional microscopy datasets. These algorithms
were developed with ananalysis ofchromosomes inmind, butthey represent afairly
general approach ofmodel-based motion analysis. Now thatthese computational methods
areavailable, there areseveral areas ofapplication towhich they willapplied inthefuture in
theSedat lab. First, theDrosophila embryo provides anexcellent system tostudy the
mechanics ofchromosome segregation and inparticular weareintheprocess ofanalyzing
theforces exerted onthese chromosomes bythepolar ejection force. Asecond promising
area ofinvestigation will beinmeiosis, where chromosome flexibility isthought tobean
important parameter determining theeffectiveness ofdiscrete interstitial pairing interactions
inaligning theentire chromosome (Kleckner andWeiner, 1993). Adult C.elegans have
transparent body walls andthemeiotic chromosomes canbestained with DNA dyes and
visualized inside theliving adult worm (W. Marshall, unpublished observations).
Application ofthecomputational methods demonstrated here tosuch asystem willallow
analysis ofthemechanics ofmeiotic chromosomes invivo.
While wehave made atentative firststeptowards analysis of4Dstructure, anumber of
technical advances areonthehorizon which would further improve theanalysis ofcell
structure andmechanics infourdimensions. Most important areautomated segmentation
techniques inwhich acomputer program canconstruct 3Dstructural models from image
data without user intervention. This isextremely important because interactive modelling
byahuman operator isboth tedious anderror-prone. Asecond keyimprovement istouse
themotion estimate todetect errors inthemodel construction process. Inparticular, in
many cases thelimited resolution ofthelight microscope makes itdifficult totellthe
connectivity between chromosome arms. 4Ddata canbeused toresolve thisambiguity,
since regions that aretruly connected willremain connected over time, while regions of
adventitious overlap willeventually become separated duetorandom movements ofthe
153chromosomes. Thus, itshould bepossible toautomatically construct theoptimal
connectivity pattern that ismost consistent with thelong term motion data.
These methodologies arenotlimited tochromosomes, either. There aremany instances
where curve-like structures undergo interesting structural dynamics. Forexample,
mitochondria inliving cells form ahighly dynamic reticulum which constantly undergoes
breakage andfusion (Nunnari etal.,1997). Automated motion estimation methods could
allow detailed determination ofbreakage andfusion rates, aswell asallow measurements
oftranslocation speeds ofthese organelles during, forexample, celldivision. In
conclusion, wefeelconfident that analysis offour dimensional behavior ofcellular
structures isgoing tobecome anincreasingly important aspect ofcellbiological research in
thenear future.

157Chapter 5.Conclusion
Thenucleus, once viewed bymany molecular biologists asasimple bagofDNA, is
turning outtobeahighly ordered structure. Cytological studies using avariety of
techniques have suggested thatchromosomes inthenucleus may bepositioned invery
specific arrangements, based largely onthelocalization ofcentromeres and/or telomeres.
Ontheother hand, itisclear that many essential biological processes, such as
recombination andmeiosis, require movements ofchromosomes, which would seem
incompatible with theidea that thenucleus ishighly organized. The purpose ofthe
experiments inthisdissertation was toanswer twolong-standing questions: towhat
extent istheposition ofagiven locus fixed within thenucleus, and towhat extent can a
given locus move around within thenucleus. Clearly, these twoquestions areactually
thesame question viewed from twodifferent viewpoints. The major findings ofthis
work arethat
--Every chromosome locus inDrosophila embryos isconsistently andreproducibly
located inaparticular region ofthenucleus thatdiffers from locus tolocus.
--There isasetofdiscrete sites onDrosophila chromosomes thatarenonrandomly
associated with thenuclear envelope. These sites arespaced roughly amegabase
apart along thelengths ofthechromosomes anddonotcorrespond toscaffold
attachment regions (SARs).
--Interphase chromatin canundergo diffusional motion with adiffusion constant in
therange 10-12 to10-13 cm2/s, asufficiently fastrate toallow motion-requiring
processes such ashomology search totakeplace onthenecessary time scale
bydiffusion. Thediffusion ofchromatin is,however, constrained, implying
attachment tosome internal nuclear structure. This confinement may bethe
physical basis ofthespecific positioning reported inchapter 2.
The most surprising finding was theextremely high degree ofspecific positioning
within thenucleus demonstrated bytheFISH experiments inchapter 2.Notonly were
158specific sites localized totheNE,other sites were nonrandomly localized tothenuclear
interior, while others reproducibly occupied more intermediate regions. Avery strong
polarity ofthenucleus wasalsoobserved. The factthatevery locus occupies adefined
position hasstrong implications forreactions thatrequire interactions between two
different loci. Unless thesub-nuclear positions oftwolocipartially overlap, they will
never interact. Conversely, ifthetwopositions dooverlap aninteraction isfavored.
Thus, amajor biological effect ofthis positioning isregulation ofchromosome
interactions. This positional determination wasalsoobserved inthechromatin motion
experiments ofchapter 3,which revealed that agiven locus isable todiffuse freely only
within alimited sub-region ofthenucleus. This again implies that iftheconfinement
regions oftwo loci donotoverlap, andinteraction isstrongly disfavored, while ifthe
confinement regions dooverlap, thecollision probability isgreatly enhanced.
These findings open uptwomajor routes ofinquiry. Ononehand, itisimportant to
being dissecting themolecular basis ofthispositioning. Ihave taken astep inthis
direction bynarrowing down aNEassociation siteusing adouble-label strategy. Atthis
point thequestion becomes addressable bymore traditional molecular approaches. The
other important direction inwhich thework may beextended istoexplore thebiological
ramifications ofpositioning anddiffusional confinement. Inparticular, itwill beofgreat
interest toexamine their roles inmeiosis. Towhat extent does adefined nuclear
architecture facilitate homology search, byplacing homologous loci insimilar locations?
Isdiffusional search sufficiently fast toexplain theobserved rates ofhomologous
pairing? Answers tothese questions willbeessential forunderstanding themechanism of
meiotic pairing aswell asother motion-requiring processes.
These studies illustrate thepower ofquantitative analysis ofmotion andstructure
using three-dimensional andfour-dimensional microscopy. The approach ofinferring
interactions andmechanistic behavior from analysis ofstructure andmotion should be
applicable toabroad range ofproblems incellbiology.
