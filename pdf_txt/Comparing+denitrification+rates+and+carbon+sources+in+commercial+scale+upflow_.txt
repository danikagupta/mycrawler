Abstract  11 
Understanding and predicting hydraulic and chemical properties of natural environment s are 12 
current crucial challenges . It require s consider ing hydraulic, chemical , and biological 13 
processes and evaluating  how hydrodynamic properties impact on biochemical reactions . In 14 
this context , we have developed an original plastic -tube laboratory experiment to study the 15 
impact of flow velocity  on denitrification  along a one -dimensional  flow streamline . Based on 16 
the example of nitrate reduction, nitrate -rich water passes through plastic tubes at several flow 17 
velocities (from 6.2 to 35 mm/min), while nitrate concentration at the tu be outlet is monitored 18 
for more than 500 hours. This experimental setup allow s assessing the biologically controlled 19 
reaction between a mobile electron acceptor (nitrate) and an electron donor (carbon) coming 20 
from an immobile phase  (tube) that releases organic carbon during its  degradation by 21  
 2 microorganisms . It results in observing various dynamics of nitrate transformation associated 22 
with biofilm development  where  flow velocity appears to be a key factor , as (i) the 23 
experiments conducted with the largest  flow velocities  are characterized by a fast increase of 24 
the reactivity rate until reaching a threshold where strong oscillations are observed ; and (ii)  25 
experiments conducted with a small flow velocity lead  to a slow increase of the reactivity rate 26 
until reaching a stable threshold value. These main behaviors are related to phases of biofilm 27 
development through a simple analytical model based on the assumption that nutrients are 28 
incorporated to cells (assimilation). The presented results and their interpretation demonstrate 29 
the impact of flow velocity on reaction performan ce and stability, and highlight the relevance 30 
of flow -through experiments over static experiments for understanding biogeochemical 31 
processes.  The previous  aspect is critical as flow velocity may be a key -controlling parameter 32 
in systems where mobile water interacts with a growing non -mobile biological phase. This is 33 
particularly the case in aquifers where a broad range of flow velocity in pores and fractures is 34 
expected  in which biochemical reactions , such as autotrophic denitrification with pyrite , can 35 
occur . 36

I. Introduction  40 
Worldwide  leaking of agricultural -derived nitrate to groundwater represent s a long -term risk 41 
for groundwater quality  [Khan and Spalding, 2004; Spalding and Exner, 1993] . In this 42 
context, n atural attenuation of this compound  by denitrification  has been extensively studied 43 
from the batch scale  [Kornaros and Lyberatos, 1997; Marazioti et al., 2003]  to the aquifer 44  
 3 scale [Clément et al., 2003; Koro m, 1992; Tarits et al., 2006] . However, a  full understanding 45 
of denitrification processes in natural systems  requires  a structural description of the 46 
interaction s between  hydraulic , chemical , and biological processes at several spatial and 47 
temporal scales [Sturman et al., 1995] . Whereas the understanding of reaction kinetics is well 48 
developed for static experiments [Hiscock et al., 1991; Korom, 1992] , it needs further 49 
development for flow -through experiments in order to establish how hydraulic heterogeneities 50 
impact reactivity in complex natural media  [Tompkins et al., 2001] . Characklis [1981]  offers 51 
a global discussion on the influence of hydraulic conditions on biofilm development (shape,  52 
size and reactive layer) and nutrient availability, and specific experiments have been 53 
developed on reactive columns [Sinke et al., 1998; von Gunten and Zobrist, 1993]  or simple 54 
geometries such as pore networks [Thullner et al., 2002]  and tubes [De Beer et al., 1996; 55 
Garny et al., 2009; Lewandowski et al., 2007] . These studies focus on relating biofilm 56 
development to reactivity processes [De Beer et al., 1996; Garny et al., 2009; Lewandowski et 57 
al., 2007]  or hydraulic parameters [Beyenal and Lewandowski, 2000; Garny et al., 2009; Lau 58 
and Liu, 1993; Stoodley et al., 1994] , where the latter experiments are conducted on conduit 59 
reactors at the centimeter scale (length and diameter/thickness) with flow velocities with 60 
orders of magnitude  of 102-103 mm/min.  However, there is a lack of knowledge about the 61 
direct impact of fluid velocity on bulk reactivity assoc iated with biochemical reactions in 62 
conditions close to natural environments. The previous  aspect is critical as flow velocity may 63 
be a key -controlling parameter in systems where mobile water interacts with a growing non - 64 
mobile biological phase (e.g., autotrophic denitrification with pyrite) . This is particularly the 65 
case in aquifers where a broad range of flow velocity in pores and fractures is expected.  66 
 The global comprehension of hydrodynamic parameter s’ effects on bioreactivity 67 
requires an accurate understanding of their interactions at the laboratory  scale.  For this 68  
 4 purpose, we propose  an experiment  in pla stic tubes that are equivalent to 1D flow system s 69 
where the geometry is perfectly known and the hydraulic parameters are well controlled. 70 
Since this experiment is not conducted on natural aquifer material, results and interpretations 71 
cannot be directly translated to field applications. For example, it has been established that 72 
microorganisms attach more rapidly to hydrophobic and nonpolar surfaces, such as Teflon 73 
and other plastics, than hy drophilic materials, such as glass or sand  [Donlan, 2002] . It implies 74 
that the duration of the attachment period might be shorter in the proposed experiment than in 75 
natural environments where  the simple geometry of the system mig ht impact attachment  as 76 
well. As attachment is known to be very difficult to characterize  [Cunningham et al., 1991]  77 
and remain s an unknown  to be estimated for each specific case [Donlan, 2002] , we do not aim 78 
to obtain conclusions concerning this process that occurs in a very short period in comparison 79 
to the biofilm -growth period  [Singh et al., 2006] . Our study focuses on the biofilm -growth 80 
period of long-term experiments and aims at characterizing the impact of hydraulic properties 81 
on (i) the efficiency of denitrification along the biofilm -growth period, and (ii) the stability of 82 
this biological reaction for bioremediat ion applications. For this matter , the proposed 83 
experiment is the most convenient configuration to assess the influence of hydrodynamic 84 
parameters, such as advection along a single flow line, as (i) it simplifies the flow complexity 85 
of the system in comparison to column experiments  that are a sum of processes occurring on a 86 
large number of flow lines;  and (ii) it avoids dealing with approximate equivalent parameters 87 
as it is usually done for interpreting standard column experiments.   88 
 In the proposed experiment , the reactivity evolution of nitrate -rich water passing 89 
through PVC tubes is measured for different flow velocities as described in section 2. The 90 
hydrodynamic dependence of the experiment results is studied in section 3 and the 91 
relationship between biofilm development and reaction processes is analyzed with a simple 92  
 5 analytical model in section 4. The impact of flow velocity on biofilm properties and reaction 93 
efficiency is then discussed in section 5.  94 
II. Experimental set -up 95 
1. Experimental concept  96 
Considering denitrification in a system where nitrate flows with water and where the electron 97 
donor (such as organic matter or mineral) comes from t he soil or rock matrix, we aim to 98 
reproduce experimental conditions where the electron acceptor is mobile with water and the 99 
electron donor comes from an immobile part . For this purpose, we propose an original 100 
biochemical experiment where nitrate -rich water is in contact with plastic tubes tha t can serve 101 
as substrate for heterotrophic bacterial growth [Mohee et al., 2008; Shah et al., 2008] . In the 102 
presented experiment, bacteria grow using carbon from the tubes and nitrate from the water, 103 
and the denitrification process is reproduced with well -controlled experimental condit ions. 104 
Although this experiment does not reproduce a natural reaction as done in standard column 105 
experiments, it is representative of biochemical reactions characterized by a mobile electron 106 
acceptor and an immobile electron donor that have been observed in  macropore soils or 107 
fractured aquifers (e.g., autotrophic denitrification with pyrite).  108 
 The simple geometry of the system enables us to know critical parameters such as the 109 
real flow velocity and the flow/carbon -source contact area, whereas standa rd column 110 
experiments are related to approximate equivalent parameters. As our experiment is 111 
conducted with slow flow velocities (from 6.2 to 35 mm/min) in small diameter tubes (2 mm) 112 
in comparison to existing open channel experiments [Garny et al., 2009; Lewandowski et al., 113 
2007] , it offers a closer reproduction of pore -scale (or fracture -scale) phenomena . The 114  
 6 presented plastic tube experiment is thus an original and convenient experimental set -up 115 
characterized by the control of key experimental parameters that are usually not well defined.  116 
 The water used in t he static and flow -through experiments present ed in the following 117 
section has  been collected at the Ploemeur site (Brittany, France). Since 1991, this site 118 
provides  water to the city of Ploemeur at a rate of 106 m3 per year [Jiménez -Martínez et al., 119 
2013; Leray et al., 2012]  thanks to a contact zone between granite and schist [Ruelleu et al., 120 
2010] . As this water extraction started, an increase of nitrate re duction and sulfate release 121 
has been observed in areas where the pumping conditions  modified the flow dynamics , 122 
whereas concentrations of nitrate remain high in other areas of th e system. From the 123 
previous  observations, Tarits et al. [2006]  concluded that natural denitrification due to a 124 
heterotrophic denitrification reaction with pyrite was enhanced by forced hydraulic 125 
conditions  in this site . In order to reproduce this  phenomena at the laboratory scale,  the 126 
presented experiments are conducted with flow velocities in the range of those estimated in 127 
the Ploemeur site under pumping conditions [Tarits et al., 2006] . Flow velocities with the 128 
same order of magnitude are considered as well for remediation applications  [Li et al., 2010]  129 
and reactivity assessment [Boisson et al., 2013]  in natural environments where reactivity and 130 
biofilm development usually occur  where the highest velocities are observed.  131 
 In the presented experiments, t he medium inoculation occurs by bacterial attachment 132 
and we assume a complete biofilm behavior without considering the diversity of microbial 133 
populations an d their interaction. Part of the microbial population could come from the tubes 134 
since no sterilization was done. Nevertheless, bacteria are supposed to mainly come from the 135 
water since (i) they are naturally present in such groundwater [Bekins, 2000; Bougon et al., 136  
 7 2009] , and (ii) several experiments with  crushed granite and water from the Ploemeur site  137 
have shown  denitrification processes [Ayraud et al., 2006; Tarits et al., 2006] . 138 
2. Static experiments  139 
Preliminary static (or batch ) experiment s enable  us to identify “reactive” plastic tubes  that are 140 
able to release carbon  to sustain heterotrophic development reactions . 150 ml of the water 141 
collected in the Ploemeur site (Brittany, France) is deoxygenated and placed in glass flasks 142 
under an argon atmosphere with (i) no plastic tubes, (ii) Pharmed® and Teflon tubes , and (iii) 143 
Watson Marlow® PVC double manifold tubes  (named  PVC tubes) . Plastic tube fragments 144 
correspond to a mass of 8 g and a reactive surface of 0.018 m2 and the experiments are 145 
conduc ted in duplicate , which  lead to similar results.  Nitrate concentration evolve s only  for 146 
the PVC tube experiments  where nitrates are completely consumed within 150 hours  with a 147 
production of organic carbon up to a concentration of 22.03 mg/L after 165 hours (Figure 1). 148 
Inorganic carbon shows small variations with a small increase at the beginning of the 149 
experiment  whereas l onger monitoring show s a release of organic carbon up to a 150 
concentration of 76.8 mg/L after 378 hours. PVC tubes are thus the carbon source of the 151 
observed denitrification reaction that does not occur without the presence of these tubes .  152 
3. Experimental conditions  for flow-through experiments  153 
After demonstrating the PVC tube reactivity with static experiments, flow-through 154 
experiments were conducted. The latter experiment s consist  of (i) continuously injecting 155 
nitrate -rich water in PVC tubes , and (ii) monitoring nitrate consumption due to bacterial 156 
development through nitrate and nitrite concentration measurements at the tube outlet s. The 157 
reactive plastic tube s used for the experiments have an  inner diameter of 2 mm and a length of 158  
 8 135 cm, and new tubes were used for each experiment . These experiments were performed  in 159 
the dark at a constant temperature of 18°C  and o xygen measurement s were done daily.  160 
 The nitrate -rich water (45 mg/L) collected in the Ploemeur site (Brittany, France) was 161 
not treated before  the experiments . Although t he water  coming from the same piezometer  has 162 
been sampled at different dates within a year , no water chemistry changes have been observed 163 
during this period. This water is almost free of organic carbon with a concentration lower than 164 
0.5 mg/L and the organic carbon concentration in the injected water remains below 0.5 ppm 165 
during the whole experiment.  166 
 Prior to experimental use, the water is deoxygenated by Argon bubbling and then 167 
maintain ed in anoxic conditions under an argon atmosphere in a high-density  polyethylene 168 
tank (whose non reactivity is controlled ). The entire system  is considered as anoxic since no 169 
oxygen enter s the system either at the inlet or through the tube walls that have a low gas 170 
permeability (as indicated by the manufacturer of PVC tubes at page 46 of the documentation 171 
available at http://www.watson -marlow.com/Documents/knowledge -hub/Brochures/gb%20 - 172 
%20UK/Product/Watson%20Marlow%20UK/b -OEM -gb-02.pdf ). In addi tion, the anoxic 173 
condition has been verified by measureme nts of oxygen concentration in water at the tube 174 
outlet . As these concentrations  remain below the measurable threshold for the whole 175 
experiment , we consider that  no aerobic degradation occur s in the system.  176 
 The water delivered from the tank to the reacting PVC tubes passes through non - 177 
reactive Teflon and Pharmed tubes placed in a peristaltic pump (Watson Marlow 205U;  178 
Figure 2) , where t he non -reactivity of the setup before the PVC tubes is checked during all the 179 
experiments. The e xperiments are performed at four different flow rates corresponding  to the 180 
flow velocities    ,   ,    and    equal to 6.2 mm/min, 11, 17 and 35 mm/min, respectively, 181 
and are condu cted in triplicate  for each flow velocity . Such velocities imply residence times in 182  
 9 the tubes ranging from 40 min utes to 3 hours and 40 min utes, whereas the whole experiment 183 
lasts more than 500 hours .  184 
4. Analysis  and methods  185 
The e xperiment s are monitored by a daily sampling of water inside the tank for the static 186 
experiment s and at the outlet of the tubes for the flow-through  experiments. All samples are 187 
filtered with a 0.45 µm Sartorius filter before analyses  and major anions (     ,     ,      , 188 
   , and   ) are analyzed  using a Dionex DX 120 ion chromatograph. Organic and inorganic 189 
carbon s are analyzed  every three days  using a Shimadzu 5050A Total Organic Carbon 190 
analyzer . For all the experiments, the volume used for analyses is equal to 5 ml. In addition, 191 
dissolved oxygen is measur ed using a WTW315i -CondOX probe and  daily flow 192 
measurements by weigh ing at the tube outlet  show variation s below 2%  in weigh ed mass .  193 
 The limited amount of sampled water prevented us from quantifying g as production in 194 
the reactive process ( NO, N2O, and  N2) and biomass concentration flowing out of the tubes . 195 
With this simple experimental set up, we assume that (i) the presence of bubbles due to gas 196 
formation has a negligible impact on biofilm development and hydraulic properties ; and (ii) 197 
our interpretation and model can be based only on nitrate and nitrite concentration variation . 198 
As explained in section 4, biomass flowing out of the tubes can be taken into account  (if 199 
needed)  in our analytical model with a parameter fitted in regards to the collected 200 
measurements. Concerning the assumptions  related to bubble formation , the impact of the 201 
presence of bubbles has been verified by measuring the velocity of bubbles that are big 202 
enough to be observable by the human eye. These velocities  are the same as the theoretical 203 
mean flow velocity based on water weight measurements and the flow velocity  measured at 204 
the outlet of the tubes is constant . We thus consider that these bubbles are not trapped in to the 205  
 10 biofilm and have a negligible impact on biofilm and hydraulic properties. For the same 206 
reasons, w e assume as well that potential micro -bubbles ( not observable by the human eye ) 207 
have a n egligible impact on these properties. This assumption is coherent with existing studies 208 
that show that an impact of bubbles on biofilm and hydraulic properties is less likely in media 209 
characterized by large pores  [Istok et al., 2007 ].  210 
III. Experimental results  211 
The n itrate consumption        (g/L) per unit of volume at time t is defined as  212 
      ( )                 ( ), (1)  
where         (g/L) is the initial concentration in the flask s for the static experiment s and the 213 
concentration measured at the tube  inlet for the flow-through  experiments , and         ( ) (g/L) 214 
is the concentration measured at time t in the flask s for the static experiments and at the tube  215 
outlet s for the flow-through  experiments.  For the latter experiments, no evolution of the 216 
nitrate concentration in the tube inlet water has been observed from daily measurements. 217 
Therefore, nitrate concentration at the tube inlet (       ) remains constant during the whole 218 
experiment (45 mg/ L). 219 
 Figure 3  represents the nitrate consumption        ( ) (equation 1) for the flow- 220 
through  experiments  where the results obtained with the flow velocities   ,   ,    and    are 221 
represented by full blue, dashed green, dashdot magenta and dotted red curves , respectively . 222 
The presented values correspond to the values averaged over three replica tes where all 223 
replicates show the same tendency and where error bars represent the mean square deviation.  224  
 11  For static experiments (Figure 1), nitrate concentration in the flask shows a simple 225 
behavior as it monotonically decreases until complete consumption within 150 hours. On the 226 
contrary, nitrate consumptions observed for flow -through experiments show a more complex 227 
behavior (Figure 3 a) and s eem to be limited by different processes during  the experiment. In 228 
order to understand which processes impact on nitrate consumption for these experiments, we 229 
consider that the evolution of nitrate variation can be roughly decomposed into two phases  230 
(Figure 3b) . The identified phases are defined and described in detail below , and their 231 
relationship to the development of biofilm observed during the experiments (Figure 4) is 232 
studied in section 4.   233 
1. Definition  of the identified  phases  234 
We wish here to identify phases characterized by specif ic behavior s of nitrate consumption  235 
and to determine which processes are responsible for these behaviors . For this purpose, we 236 
interpret general tendencies of the results presented in Figure 3a , and we focus on the 237 
evolution of nitrate consumption during  the experiment for each flow velocity and on the 238 
differences observed between the experiments conducted with different flow velocities.    239 
 Focusing on the general  behavior of nitrate consumption, we observe that the 240 
measurements increase with time with small  variations around the dashed black curve  plotted 241 
in Figure 3a until a specific time    (denote d here after transition time ). The value of this 242 
transition time correspond s to the transition between the black and red periods represented in 243 
Figure 3b and is evaluated at 460 hours, 266, 300, and 99 hours for the experiments conducted 244 
with a flow velocity of 6.2 mm/min , 11, 17, and 35 mm/min, respectively.  After these  245 
transitio n time s, nitrate consumption clearly differs from the previous general  linear behavior , 246 
as we observe (i) a “relative” stabilization with small variations for the slower (full blue 247  
 12 curve) and higher (dotted red curve) flow velocities, and (ii) a general  decreasing tendency for 248 
the intermediate flow velocities (dashed green and dashdot magenta curves).  As the variations 249 
around the dashed black curve for      are small in comparison to the divergence from this 250 
curve for     , we consider that nitrate consumption can be divided into two phases  denoted 251 
phase 1 for      and phase 2 for     . 252 
2. Initiation of degradation  process es (phase 1)   253 
In the first phase identified in Figure 3 a (denoted phase 1  in Figure 3b ), the nitrate 254 
consumption s observed for the four flow velocities tend to follow a linear increase in contrast  255 
to the large  variations observed during the whole experiment. This linear tendency is 256 
represented by a dashed black curve  in Figure 3a and lasts for the black period represented in 257 
Figure 3b . As previously described, the duration of this phase depends on the flow velo city, 258 
and last s, for example,  for 92% of the experimental duration for the slower flow velocity and 259 
only 19.8% of the experimental duration for the higher flow velocity.  260 
 In comparison with the large variations observed during the whole experiment, we 261 
consider that nitrate consumptions observed for the different flow velocities present a small 262 
range of variation during phase 1. For example, when      h, the experiments conducted 263 
with a flow velocity of  6.2 mm/min, 11, 17 and 35 mm/min are in phase 1 and the values of 264 
nitrate consumption range from 0.9 to 2.9 mg/L . In opposition, when       h, the 265 
experiment conducted with a flow velocity of 35  mm/min is in phase 2 and present s a value of 266 
nitrate consumption of 1.2  mg/L , whereas the experiments conducted with a flow velocity of  267 
11 mm/min , 17 and 35 mm/min are in phase 1 and present values of nitrate consumption that 268 
range  from 4 to 4.8 mg/L . 269  
 13  The previous observations are based on the tempo ral evolution of nitrate consumption 270 
for experiments conducted with several flow velocities. As the residence times within the 271 
tubes are flow -velocity dependent, these results might be difficult to interpret. For example , 272 
similar values of nitrate consumption correspond to a greater reactivity for a higher flow 273 
velocity . In order t o take into account the impact of various residence times, we define  the 274 
nitrate degradation rate       (in mg m-2 s-1) as  275 
     ( )           , (2)  
where   (L/s) is the flow rate within the tube and S (m2) the reactive tube surface in contact 276 
with the water.  In addition, as the quantity of water passing through the system until a given 277 
time is flow -velocity dependent  as well , we define  the pore volume  number       (-) as  278 
    ( )      , (3)  
which correspond s to the volume of water used in  the system until time   divided by the tube 279 
volume   (m3). In other words, the pore volume number enables us to evaluate  the number of 280 
tubes that are filled up until a given time for a given flow velocity. Studying the evolution of 281 
the nitrate degradation rate       with the  pore volume number       enables us to compare the 282 
reactivity observed for different flow velocities considering similar quantities  of water used in  283 
the system.  284 
 Figure 5 a represents the  evolution of the nitrate degradation rate       with the 285 
number of pore volumes      and Figure 5b shows the duration of phase 1 in terms of pore 286 
volume numbers . These duration s are evaluated by using equation 3 with the transition time s 287 
   previously determined for each flow velocity. It leads to duration of phase 1 in terms of 288 
pore volume numbers equal to 126 .8, 130, 226 .7, and 154  for the flow velocity 6.2 mm/min, 289  
 14 11, 17, and 35 mm/min, respectively. These results show  as well that strong variations of the 290 
nitrate degradation rate are not observed during phase 1 and are rather observed after this 291 
phase. These observations are again relative to the general  behavior during the whole 292 
experiment, as nitrate degradation rate differs for the flow velocity 35 mm/min from the 293 
values observed for the three lower flow velocities. However, these variations are small in 294 
comparison to the variations observed during the rest of the experiments. It implies that the 295 
consumption  (or degradation) rate of nitrates depends mainly on the quantity of water passed 296 
through the tubes (i.e., the number of pore volume s) and that flow velocity impacts mainly the 297 
final behavior  of the reactivity  (phase 2) . The mass  of nitrate  consumed per pore volume is  298 
thus independent of the residence time .  299 
 At the beginning of the experiment biofilm develops as clusters from the millimeter to 300 
the centimeter scale (Figure 4 a), and then spreads  continuously along the tubes ( Figure 4 b). 301 
During this first phase , the increase of the degradation rate with time can therefore be related 302 
to biofilm development inside the tubes. As nitrate and organic carbon are present at the tube 303 
outlet s (where  carbon concentration ranges  from 6.5 to 21  mg/L ), they are in excess in the 304 
system  and cannot be considered as limiting factor s. The factor controlling this first phase for 305 
flow-through  experiments is thus the bacterial growth rate leading to a total consumption of  306 
nitrate for the static experiment s. 307 
3. Stabilization and decrease (phase 2)  308 
In the second identified phase (phase 2 in Figure 3), the nitrate consumption is characterized 309 
by either (i) a “relative” stabilization with small variations for the slower (full blue curve) and 310 
higher (dotted red curve) flow velocities, or (ii) a general  decreasing tendency for t he 311 
intermediate flow velocities (dashed green and dashdot magenta curves). Concerning the 312  
 15 fastest velocity   , the previously named “relative stabilization” corresponds to a succession 313 
of decreases and increases oscillating around a “relative threshold”.  314 
 As carbon and nitrates (the main reactants) are still in excess at the tube outlet s, their 315 
availability is not the limiting factor. The nitrate reduction capacity during this phase seems 316 
thus to be controlled by the flow  velocity that  can impact biofilm properties . The following 317 
section is dedicated to explain ing the experimental observations by relating them to biofilm 318 
properties.  The two phases previously identified are linked to several steps of the biofilm 319 
development  with specific flow -dependences .  320 
IV. Linking biofilm properties and reaction process es 321 
From the measurements of nitrate and nitrite concentrations in both static and flow-through  322 
experiments, the present section aims to evaluate  the biofilm properties and relate  them to the 323 
observed reaction efficiency.  324 
1. Evaluation of biofilm properties  325 
Cumulative biofilm weight  326 
Since the dynamic of biofilm  development  is likely important in the reaction rate evolution , 327 
we aim to evaluate  the dynamic of produced biofilm mass during the experiment s. Continuous 328 
monitoring and complete quantification of the biofilm w ere not possible during the 329 
experiment due to technical reasons. To counteract this problem, we propose to estimate  the 330 
biofilm propert y evolution considering that the  production of cells can be calculated using the 331 
method of  McCarty [1972]  in which the quantity of produced mass depend s on the el ectron 332 
donor . For example , 0.24 g of cells is produced per gram NO 3-N removed for H 2 [Ergas and 333 
Reuss, 2001; Ergas and Rheinheimer, 2004] , 0.64  g of cells in the case of sulfur  [Sengupta 334  
 16 and Ergas, 2006] , and 0.45 g and 1.21  g of cells in the case of methanol and acetic acid , 335 
respectively  [Hamlin et al., 2008] . Those authors consider that the usual range of 336 
heterotrophic denitrification is between 0.6 and 0.9 g of cell s produced per  gram of NO 3-N 337 
removed.  In the present study, and  for demonstra tion purposes , we consider the mean value of 338 
the previous range , correspondin g to 0.75 g of cells produced per  gram of NO 3-N removed, or 339 
0.17 g of organic matter produced per  gram of nitrate  consumed .  340 
 Note that the main uncertainty is then about N gas ses (N2, NO) that are produced but 341 
not measured  (as explained in section 2.4) . However, t he corresponding reaction given by 342 
equation 4 in the case of methanol [Hamlin et al., 2008]  shows that, even  if a considerable 343 
mass of cells can be produce d in comparison to the mass of nitrate removed , only a small 344 
fraction of nitrogen is assimilated in the cell and most of it is reduced to N 2 345 
                                                          . (4)  
 Assuming  that 1  g of consumed nitrate allow s the production of  0.17 g of organic 346 
matter , we calculate the temporal evolution of the cumulative biofilm weight     ̅̅̅̅̅̅ (g) from 347 
the NO 3 and NO 2 in and out fluxes  as 348 
    ̅̅̅̅̅̅( )                    ̅̅̅̅̅̅̅( )     ( ), (5)  
where       (g/mol) is the mola r mass of nitrate ,         ̅̅̅̅̅̅̅ (mol) the total number of nitrate 349 
moles used for biofilm formation until time   , and      (g) a “loss parameter ” that represents 350 
potential loss of biomass  that could be  flushed out of the tubes . The number of moles         ̅̅̅̅̅̅̅ in 351 
equation 5 is evaluated from the number of consumed nitrate moles          ̅̅̅̅̅̅̅ (mol) and produced 352 
nitrite moles          ̅̅̅̅̅̅̅ (mol) as 353  
 17         ̅̅̅̅̅̅̅( )          ̅̅̅̅̅̅̅( )          ̅̅̅̅̅̅̅( ). (6)  
Note that equation 6 assumes that the quantity of nitrate used for biofilm formation 354 
corresponds to the quantity of consumed nitrate that is not transformed to nitrite . As stated 355 
before, it assumes  that only a small portion of the consumed nitrate is reduced to gas and that 356 
this quantity can be neglected.  In addition, the previous formulation considers that biofilm 357 
formation is not limited by the availability of carbon , as we observe that this reactant is  in 358 
excess during the whole experiment . 359 
 In equation 6, the molar  quantities          ̅̅̅̅̅̅̅ and          ̅̅̅̅̅̅̅ are deduced from nitrate and 360 
nitrite concentration measurements.  Thus, the total number of nitrate moles used for biofilm 361 
formation until time t is expressed as follow s. 362

(g/L) are nitrate and nitrite concentrations , respectively,  measured at time  t in the batch 366 
volume ( for batch experiment) and at the tube outlet s (for flow -through experiment s),       367 
(g/mol) is the mol ar mass of nitrite,   (L) is the water volume for the batch experiment and   368 
(L/s) the flow rate for the flow-through experiment s. 369  
 18  Figure 6 shows the temporal evolution of biofilm properties characterized by the 370 
cumulative biofilm weight     ̅̅̅̅̅̅ (in mg). Concerning the differences between batch ( large 371 
black curve) and flow -through  (full blue, dashed green, dashdot magenta and dotted red 372 
curves) experiments , we observe that  (i) a stronger increase of the biofilm weight is observed 373 
for the batch experiment, and (ii) the batch experiment leads to a constant biofilm weight 374 
observed in the last part of the large black curve. These observations are related to differences 375 
between the experimental setup of the batch and flow -through experiments , where all the 376 
nitrates to be consumed are present in the batch volume at the very beginning  of the batch  377 
experiment , whereas the nitrate s are progressively introduced into the system for the flow - 378 
through experiments. It implies that the nitrate concentration is higher at the beginning of the 379 
batch experiment and that the biofilm weight increases quickly until total cons umption of the 380 
nitrate present in the batch volume .  381 
 Concerning the flow -through experiments, differences are observed for the different 382 
flow velocities  (Figure 6) . For a given time, the biofilm weight increases when increasing  the 383 
flow velocities for the experiments conducted with the flow velocities   ,   , and   . In 384 
relation to the results presented in Figure 3 , nitrate consumption for these three flow velocities 385 
present small differences during phase 1  in contrast  to the large differences observed during 386 
the rest of the experiment. These small differences are observed for 266 hours , as it is the 387 
smallest duration of phase 1 for the flow velocities   ,   , and   . As biofilm weight 388 
estimates are based on the values of nitrate consumption and flow rate (equation 5 -8), the 389 
differences observed before  this specific time  are mainly due  to the different  flow velocities 390 
of these experiments . Knowing that these velocities regulate  the quantity of nitrates entering 391 
into the system, a higher flow velocity results in a larger biofilm weight , as observed for the 392 
flow velocities   ,   , and    from     to       hours . After this specific  time, although 393  
 19 nitrate consumption in Figure 3a is higher for the slower velocity, these differences with the 394 
other flow velocities are not large enough to modify the previous behavior. Note that t he 395 
previous observations are not valid for the experiment conducted with the highest velocity   , 396 
as nitrate consumption in this case differs from the nitrate consumpti on observed for the three 397 
lowest  velocities  after 100 hours (Figure 3 a). We observe then in Figure 6a that the small 398 
values of nitrate consumption  combined with the high flow velocity    lead to a biofilm 399 
weight comparable to the estimate obtained  for the flow velocity   . 400 
 At the end of the slowest experiment , the biofilm has been extracted from the tube and 401 
its dry weight evaluated at 1.9  mg, whereas the proposed model leads to a cumulative biofilm 402 
weight of 0.62 mg. This difference is likely due to the simplifications of the proposed model 403 
where the addition of suspended materials and Extracellular Polymeric Substan ces are not 404 
considered . Uncertainties remain as well concerning the relation linking cells produced per 405 
quantity  of consumed nitrate  and the impact of flow velocity on the reaction stoichiometry. 406 
All the previous  processes could contribute to the increase of the biofilm weight evaluated by 407 
our model. In addition, as the measurement of biofilm by extraction from the tube is 408 
destructive, it can be done only once at the end of the experiment.  This limitation prevents us 409 
from obtaining ex tensive data on the biofilm properties. However, a s previously  explained , 410 
this experimental setup is the most convenient in order to study the impact of hydraulic 411 
properties on reactivity . In addition, the present study aims to conduct  a qualitative analysis  412 
where we are particularly interested in the relative temporal evolution of the biofilm 413 
properties for different flow velocities and in their link to the reaction efficiency . As the 414 
proposed model tends to underestimate the biofilm weight, the parameter      that represents 415 
potential loss of biofilm is set to 0 and we assume that processes such as detachment and 416 
decay are negligible in the present study. Regarding the previous assumptions, biofilm 417  
 20 properties such as biomass and thickness are refe rred and interpreted as cumulative properties 418 
along the experimental time.  419 
Cumulative b iofilm thickness  420 
For comparison with previous studies , we evaluate t he cumulative biofilm thickness      by 421 
considering that biofilm  forms a uniform cy linder stuck  on the tube wall . The cumulative 422 
biofilm thickness      is defined as  423 
       √         ⁄, (9)  
where R is the radius of the tube,     the tube length , and      the biofilm volume. This volume 424 
is deduced from the cumulative biofilm mass     ̅̅̅̅̅̅ (equation 5) assumi ng a biofilm mass 425 
density of 10  mg/cm3 [Williamson and McCarty, 1976] . In order t o obtain comparable results, 426 
the same geometry is assumed for static and flow-through  experiments. Note that biofilm 427 
thickness gives the same qualitative information as the biofilm weight  and is introduced here 428 
only for an easier comparison with existing  studies . 429 
 As tube experiments are conducted for several flow velocities, the temporal evolution 430 
of biofilm is potentially impacted by both the effect of flow on biofilm structure and  the mass  431 
of nutrient injected in to the system over time. In order t o focus on the interaction s between 432 
flow and biofilm -structure  properties , we study the biofilm evolution with the quantity of 433 
nutrient input        (g). For batch experiments ,        corresponds to the mass of nitrate 434 
present in  the tank at the beginning of the experiment and is defined as  435 
                . (10)   
 21 For the flow -through experiments ,       ( ) corresponds to the mass of nitrate introduced 436 
into the system until time   and is defined as  437 
      ( )            . (11)  
 Figure 7 shows the evolution of the biofilm  properties  (characterized here by the 438 
cumulative biofilm thickness     ) with the quantity of nutrient input        . The b atch 439 
experiment  (large black curve)  leads to a fast consumption of nutrient  because the small initial 440 
quantity of nutrient is not enriched by new inputs. Concerning the flow-through experiments , 441 
the presented results  show that increasing the flow velocity  leads to (i) smaller values of the 442 
biofilm thickness per nutrient input unit , and (ii) a slower evolution of the bio film growth 443 
along the quantity of injected nutrient. It implies that fast velocities result in a thinner (or less 444 
dense) “effective ” biofilm  per nutrient input unit , where “effective” means that the biofilm is 445 
assumed to be homogeneous and of the same density for all experiments . This biofilm 446 
thickness per nutrient input unit can also be interpreted as a “potential” thickness, as its 447 
estimate does not take into account possible erosion and/or detachment process es. Note that 448 
the previous observations are valid for the evolution of the biofilm thickness along the 449 
quantity of nutr ient injected into the system and not along the experimental time.   450 
 By relating biofilm growth to the nitrate transformation  rate, the next section aims to 451 
characterize  how the evolution of biofilm properties  is related to the flow velocity and how 452 
the flow velocity impact s the reaction efficiency.  453  
 22 4. Linking biofilm growth and nitrate transformation  454 
In order t o illustrate the flow -dependent heterogeneity of biofilm structures and its potential 455 
role on nitrate transformation , we calculate the rate of  nitrate transformation         (mg m-2 s-456 
1) and compare it to our estimate of biofilm thickness.  457 
For the batch experiment,         is defined as  458 
      ( )          
    
  (12)  
where           (g/L) is the concentration of nitrate transformed in biofilm during the time 459 
interval    and S is the reactive PVC surface . The value of           at time    is evaluated by 460 
the following expression for the batch experiment : 461 
         (  ) [        (  )         (    )]       (13)  
where         (  ) (mol/L) is the number of moles transformed in biofilm per unit of volume 462 
until time    and is expressed as  463 
        (  )                 (  )
              (  )
     . (14)  
 For the flow-through experiments, the interval time    of expression 12 is set to the 464 
time required to travel along the tube by advection (from its inlet to its outlet)  and leads to the 465 
following expression  466 
      ( )            
  (15)   
 23 where           is the concentration of nitrate contributing to biofilm formation during the 467 
interval time   . The concentration           in equation 15 is expressed as  468 
         (  ) [        (  )         (  )]       (16)  
where          (  ) and         (  ) are defined by expression 1 4 with         (  ) the value at the 469 
tube inlet.  Note that the rate of nitrate transformation (equation s 12 and 15) and nitrate 470 
degradation rate  (equation 2 ) differ , as the first one considers only the nitrate contributing to 471 
biofilm growth (assimilation) and the second one considers all the nitrate consumed during 472 
the experiment (reduction).   473 
 Figure 8 shows the evolution of the nitrate transformation rate        (equation s 12 474 
and 15 ) as a function of our estimate of the cumulative biofilm thickness       (equation 9) for 475 
the batch (black curve) and flow-through  experiments ( full blue, dashed green, dashdot 476 
magenta and dotted red curves ). For the batch experiment , the nitrate transformation rate  is 477 
characterized by  (i) a strong increase when the biofilm thicknes s evolves from 0 to 8.8  m, 478 
and (ii) a strong decrease when the biofilm thickness is larger than 8.8 m. As expected in 479 
this case, biofilm growth is (i) first fast and not limited by nitrate concentration , and (ii)  then 480 
limited by nutrient availability , as the total quantity of nitrate is consumed at the end of the 481 
experiment.  482 
 Results presented in Figure 8 show that the very beginning of the flow -through  483 
experiments is characterized by a similar strong linear increase of the nitrate transformation 484 
rate (dashed black line) . The n itrate transformation rate differs from the previous behavior 485 
when the biofilm thickness reaches the values of 0.16 and 0.41 m for the flow -through  486  
 24 experiments    and   , respectively, and the value of 1 m for the flow -through  experiments  487 
   and   .  488 
 After the previously described  linear increase, the nitrate transformation rate 489 
associated with the slowest flow velocity    follows two distinguished behaviors. When the 490 
biofilm thickness is between 0.16 and 4.4 m, the superposition of the large black and full 491 
blue curves shows small differ ences of the nitrate transformation rate for the batch experiment 492 
and flow-through  experiment    . When the biofilm thickness is larger than 4.4 m, the 493 
behavior of the se two experiments differs and the nitrate transformation rate is characterized 494 
by a relative stabilization for the flow experiment    .  495 
 Increasing the flow velocity from    to    implies that the initial  linear increase of the 496 
nitrate transformation rate is observed until the biofilm thickness reaches the value of 0.41 m 497 
(instead of 0.16 m for the flow velocity   ). When the biofilm thickness is larger than 498 
0.41 m, the flow experiment    leads to a relative stabilization of the nitrate transformation 499 
rate characterized by small variations in comparison to the initial linear  increase.  500 
 Finally, the flow experiments conducted with the two fastest flow velocities    and    501 
lead to comparable results. In both cases,  the behavior of the nitrate transformation rate differs 502 
from the initial linear increase when the biofilm t hickness reaches the value of 1  m. When 503 
the biofilm thickness is larger than 1  m, the nitrate transformation rate is characterized by a 504 
series of strong variations that oscillate around a similar threshold value.  505 
V. Discussion  506 
The evolution of the nitrate transformation rate        with the biofilm thickness      507 
presented in Figure 8 shows different behaviors between the batch and flow -through  508  
 25 experiments and between the flow -through experiments conducted with different flow 509 
velocities. These behaviors are described in section 4.2 in terms of experimental -setup and 510 
flow-velocity impact on reaction efficiency . In the present section, we wish to relate  the 511 
previous observations to the evolution of the biofilm properties  along the experiment  by 512 
proposing several scenarios of the flow -velocity impact on these properties. These scenarios 513 
are deduced  by (i)  determining under which conditions the presence of flow impact s nitrate 514 
transformation rate , (ii) evaluating th e impact of flow velocity on denitrification efficiency 515 
and stability , and (iii) discussing the proposed evolution of the b iofilm properties in relation to 516 
existing studies.   517 
Impact of the presence of flow on nitrate transformation rate  518 
The results presented in Figure 8 are used here to identify under which conditions the 519 
presence of flow impacts nitrate transformation rate. For this purpose, we focus on the two 520 
following aspects  of the evolution of        with     : (i) the similar linear increase observed 521 
for a very short time at the beginning of the flow -through experiments , and (ii)  the similarities 522 
and differences observed between the flow-through and batch experiment s. 523 
 When the biofilm thickness is smaller than 0.16 m, the flow -through experiments 524 
show a similar behavior that seems not to depend on the flow velocity. Although additional 525 
data are required to characterize this short period, this behavior might be due to a 526 
phenomenon  that initiates the reactive process, such as attachment of cells by adsorption on 527 
the tube walls , which is not flow -velocity dependent for the studied range of velocities . 528 
 After this first short -term period, the nitrate transformation rate for the flow -through 529 
experiment    and the batch experiment presents small differences  until that the biofilm 530 
thickness reaches 4.51 m. Considering  the batch experiment  as a reference experiment 531  
 26 without flow, i t shows that the hydraulic conditions of the flow -through experiment    do not 532 
impact the reaction efficiency when the biofilm thickness is between 0.16 and 4.51 m. In 533 
other words , the flow velocity    is most likely  too small to modify the structural properties 534 
of the biofilm  for this  range of values of the biofilm thickness . In comparison, t he relationship 535 
between        and      for the three fastest flow -through experiments (   ,    and   ) clearly 536 
differs from the batch experiment . In the se cases,  the flow velocities may be high enough to 537 
impact the biofilm properties  during the whole experiment . 538 
Impact of f low velocity on reaction efficiency  539 
A strong linear increase of the nitrate transformation rate with biofilm growth is observed  at 540 
the beginning of the flow -through experiments . This linear increase is represented by a dashed 541 
black curve in Figure 8  and is observed until the biofilm thickness reaches 0.16 m for the 542 
flow velocity   , 0.41  m for the flow velocity   , and 1  m for the flow velocities    and   . 543 
This fast evolution of the nitrate transformation rate may characterize  a fast modification of 544 
the biofilm/fluid reactive contact area while  the biofilm thickness  is smaller than a flow - 545 
velocity dependent value . As the nitrate transformation rate increases when increasing the 546 
flow velocity during this period , larger values of flow velocity may optimize  the reaction 547 
efficiency .  548 
 In relation to p revious studies , it has been demonstrated that  hydraulic constraints can 549 
imply an increase of the biofilm height [Hornemann et al., 2009]  due to the presence of 550 
secondary velocities that are perpendicular to the deposit surface and that generate an upward 551 
shear force in the downstream side of the biofilm [Vo and Heys, 2011] . It results in a higher 552 
and heterogeneous biofilm structure that optimizes the biofilm/fluid contact area and thus the 553 
efficiency of the denitrification process. In addition, it has been demonstrated that applying 554  
 27 fast advective  flows parallel to the deposit surface lead s to heterogeneous deposits of bacteria 555 
along the tube surface [Yu et al., 1999] . This phenomenon  results  in the formation of patch  556 
structures  that have been observed  during the experiments ( Figure 4 a) and where  the 557 
biofilm/fluid contact area is optimized in comparison to continuous structures .  558 
 It is important to notice that these conclusions are in contradiction with some previous 559 
studies showing that fluid shear tends to compress the biofilm towards the surface [Picioreanu 560 
et al., 2001; van Loosdrecht et al., 2002; Wanner et al., 1995] . However , the biofilm models 561 
and experiments of the se studies are based on assumptions that differ from our experiment, 562 
such as homogeneous and isotropic biofilm assumption [Picioreanu et al., 2001]  or 563 
experiment al conditions where flow is applied to a biofilm grown without flow [Wanner et 564 
al., 1995] . This demonstrates the complexity of the relationshi p between biofilm properties 565 
and hydrodynamic parameters, the importance of model assumptions and experimental 566 
conditions, and the critical differences of biofilm properties when the biofilm grows under 567 
static or flow-through  conditions.  568 
Impact of flow velocity on reaction stabilization  569 
Whereas the flow -through experiment    and the batch experiment present small differences 570 
when the biofilm thickness is smaller than 4.51 m, the nitrate transformation rate of these 571 
experiments differs for larger values of the biofilm thickness. For these values ( larger than 572 
4.51 m),        shows a relative stabilization for the flow -through experiment    whereas it 573 
keeps increasing for the batch experiment. From these observations, it seems that the 574 
hydraulic conditions of the flow -through experiment    lead to biofilm production/loss 575 
equilibrium driven by processes such as decay and erosion  for large r values of the biofilm 576 
thickness .  577  
 28  An important change of behaviors  is also observed for the flow -through experiments 578 
  ,   , and   . After the linear increase observed at the beginning of the experiment (black 579 
dash curve) , the nitrate transformation rate oscillates around the threshold  value reached when  580 
the biofilm thickness is equal to  0.44 m for the flow velocity    and 1  m for the flow 581 
velocities    and   . The observed successions of increase /decrease cycle s of the nitrate 582 
transformation rate may characterize repeated variations of the biofilm/fluid reactive contact 583 
area, and thus of the biofilm structural properties.  Increasing  the flow velocity from    to    584 
implies that (i) the transition between the linear increase and the relative stabilization is 585 
observed for a larger value  of the biofilm thickness, (ii) the nitrate transformation rate 586 
oscillates around a larger threshold value , and (iii) the variations of the nitrate transformation 587 
rate around th is threshold value are larger  (which is observed as well when increasing the 588 
flow velocity from    to   ).    589 
 The transition from a linear increase to a relative stabilization starts by a slow decrease 590 
of the nitrate  transformation rate . This decrease is observed when the biofilm thickness 591 
evolves from 1.4 to 3.2  m for the flow velocities    and    and might characterize  a 592 
progressive variation of the biofilm structural properties  from an optimal configuration to a 593 
less reactive configuration . The transition from patches ( Figure 4 a) to continuous structures 594 
(Figure 4 b) observed during the experiments is characteristic of the previous behavior where 595 
the patch  structures optimize the biofilm/fluid contact area (and thus the reactivity) in 596 
comparison to continuous structures . In addition,  the transition from the first to the second 597 
kind of structures might occur  progressively with new deposits and/or bacterial growth that 598 
fill the spaces between patches.  599 
 The large oscillations of the nitrate transformation rate observed for the flow veloc ities 600 
   and    may characteriz e fast and important variations of the biofilm structural properties  601  
 29 due to flow -dependent phenomena such as detachment and reattachment . These experiments 602 
correspond to hydraulic conditions wi th fast flow velocities that can imply a strong 603 
heterogeneity of the structures due to upward shear forces and heterogeneous deposit s (as 604 
explained in the previous section) . In relation to prev ious studies, it has been shown  that t he 605 
formation of heterogen eous structures implies the presence of protuberances on the biofilm 606 
surface where micro organisms grow faster and form tower -like colonies  [Picioreanu et al., 607 
1998] . It leads to the presence of cavities where nutrient s are not easily accessible and 608 
enhances  the fragility  of the biofilm , and thus potential detachment . In addition, f or strong 609 
shear stress (correlated to fast flows), the potential detachment promotes biofilm spatial 610 
heterogeneity by  reattachment  [Stewart, 1993] . The observed succession of decrease s and 611 
increase s might thus be due to detachments and reattachments  related to a strong 612 
heterogeneity  of the biofilm structures .  613 
VI. Conclusion  614 
The presented experiment an d analytical framework aim to characterize biochemical 615 
reactivity in the case of mobile/immobile electron acceptor /donor  under flow-through  616 
conditions to assess the influence of flow velocity on biologically constrained reaction  rates. 617 
This is done through an  original experiment where  nitrate -rich water passes  continuously 618 
through plastic tubes  at several flow velocities (from 6.2 to 35  mm/min) . Flow velocity 619 
appears to be a key factor for reaction efficiency and stability as experiments conducted with 620 
the largest flow velocities are characterized by a fast  increase of the reactivity rate until 621 
reaching a threshold where strong oscillations are observed . This behavior may characterize  622 
an optimization of the biofilm /fluid  reactive contact area followed by equilibrium between 623 
bacteria development and flow impact on the biofilm structures subject to decay/detachment 624  
 30 phenomena.  In opposition, the same experiment conducted with a small flow velocity leads to 625 
a slow increase of the reactivity rate until reaching a stable threshold value.  626 
 The different behavio rs observed between batch and flow-through  experiment s show 627 
the relevance of flow-through  experiments for the understanding and characterization of 628 
biogeochemical process es in natural media.  The presented flow-through  experiments 629 
demonstrate that the presence of flow impacts the reactivity -rate behavior at different steps of 630 
the biofilm development with step -dependent effects of the flow intensity. In natural 631 
environments characterized by a broad range of flow velocit ies, such as soils with macropores 632 
or fractured aquifers, the resulting heterogeneous reaction rates might impact the global 633 
reactivity of the site.  In addition, flow-through  conditions related to long-term pumping for 634 
water exploitation  seem  to have an impact on biogeochemical reactivity as observed in the 635 
Ploemeur site [Tarits et al., 2006]  by enhancing the long -term reactivity at the site scale. For 636 
fractured media, most of the denitrification process should occur within the fractures, as they 637 
are opened channels favorable to microbial development and nutrient  (i.e. nitrates)  circulation  638 
[Johnson et al., 1998]  where the electron donor , such as pyrite , is present as a solid phase . 639 
 This study presents an interesting experiment to characterize the influence of flow 640 
velocity on biogeochemical reactions where the impact of flow velocity on reactivity is 641 
demonstrated. We further propose a framework for its interpretation. Unfortunately i t was not 642 
possible to continuously monitor and characterize the biofilm due to technical constraints. 643 
Future works should include a detailed biofi lm characterization and measur ements  of the 644 
biomass flowing out of the tubes.  However, this study provides interesting insights on the 645 
interest of flow -through experiments over static  experiments as well as on the complexity of 646 
reactivity in flow -through conditions.  In addition, it improves our understanding of 647 
heterogeneous and velocity -dependent reactivity in both porous and fractured media . 648  
 31 Although this experiment was designed with the example  of denitrification  in synthetic 649 
condition s, observation s and conclusion s should be easily transposab le to other applications . 650
