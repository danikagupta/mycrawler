Abstract
To verify whether dyes emitted within the discharge of a dye processing plant were contributing to the mutagenicity
repeatedly found in the Cristais River, Sa ˜o Paulo, Brazil, we chemically characterized the following mutagenic samples:
the treated industrial eﬄuent, raw and treated water, and the sludge produced by a Drinking Water Treatment Plant
(DWTP) located /C246 km from the industrial discharge. Considering that 20% of the dyes used for coloring activities
might be lost to wastewaters and knowing that several dyes have mutagenic activity, we decided to analyze the samplesfor the presence of dyes. Thin layer chromatographic analysis indicated the presence of three prevalent dyes in all sam-ples, except for the drinking water. This combination of dyes corresponded to a commercial product used by the indus-
try, and it tested positive in the Salmonella assay. The structures of the dye components were determined using proton
magnetic resonance and mass spectrometric (MS) methods, and the dyes were tested for mutagenicity. The blue com-ponent was identiﬁed as the C.I. Disperse Blue 373, the violet as C.I. Disperse Violet 93, and the orange as C.I. Disperse
Orange 37. The dyes showed mutagenic responses of 6300, 4600, and 280 revertants/ lg for YG1041 with S9 respec-
tively. A bioassay-directed fractionation/chemical analysis showed that the C.I. Disperse Blue 373 contributed 55%of the mutagenic activity of the DWTP sludge. We showed that these dyes contributed to the mutagenic activity found

in the Cristais River environmental samples analyzed and are indirectly aﬀecting the quality of the related drinking
water. Therefore, we believe that this type of discharge should be more thoroughly characterized chemically and tox-
icologically. Additionally, human and ecological risks associated with the release of dye processing plant eﬄuents
should be more fully investigated, especially where the resultant water is taken for human consumption.Published by Elsevier Ltd.

1. Introduction
A review of the mutagenicity of eﬄuents showed
that textile and other dye-related industries produceconsistently genotoxic eﬄuents that are in some cases
potent when compared to other industrial discharges
(Houk, 1992 ). In the metropolitan area of Sa ˜o Paulo,
Brazil, Sanchez et al. (1988) found that wastewater
from several textile industries gave the most positive
mutagenic responses (nine positive results in 12 sam-ples) among several types of industrial eﬄuents ana-
lyzed. Likewise, Coelho et al. (1992) showed that a
dye processing plant discharge was one of the majorcontributors to the mutagenic activity found in theParaiba River in Sa ˜o Paulo State ( Valent et al., 1993 ).
In this study, the authors speculated that dyes could
be causing the mutagenic activity although analysisfor the presence of dyes was not performed. More re-
cently, others found that untreated textile wastewater
was contributing to the contamination of ground waterin India ( Rajaguru et al., 2002 ). In this case, dyes and/
or their cleavage products as well as impurities and
auxiliaries associated with textile wet processing werealso speculated to be responsible for the observed muta-genicity. Unfortunately, none of the studies cited above
chemically characterized the mutagenic samples so as to
prove which compounds were causing the observedmutagenicity.
When a dye is used in the textile dyeing process, a
portion does not attach to the ﬁbers thus remainingin the dye baths. The resultant wastewater is usually
treated in an activated sludge plant, and the liquid eﬄu-
ent is released to adjacent surface waters. A studyperformed in 1989 showed that the commercial amin-
oazobenzene dye, C.I. Disperse Blue 79, is not degraded
in a conventionally operated activated sludge processand 85% of the dye remains in the system. Of this85%, 3% is retained by the primary sludge, 62% by the
activated sludge and 20% is found in the ﬁnal, environ-
mentally released liquid eﬄuent ( US EPA, 1989 ). If an
anaerobic system is employed before the activated
sludge treatment, cleavage of azo bonds can occur,
and the release of the related aromatic amines is ob-served. Ekici et al. (2001) tested the stability of selected
azo dye metabolites in activated sludge and in water.They concluded that these dye metabolites were rela-
tively stable in the aquatic environment and could not
be eﬃciently degraded under the wastewater plant con-
ditions. In regard to mutagenicity, Fracasso et al.
(1992) showed that dye factory eﬄuents from primary
and secondary biological treatment exhibited increased
levels of mutagenic activity when compared with theraw (untreated) eﬄuent. The use of activated carbon ﬁl-
tration was beneﬁcial but did not completely remove the
mutagenic activity of the ﬁnal eﬄuent.
According to Arslan et al. (1999) , 20% of the dyes
used for coloring activities might be lost to wastewater,
but only two published studies were found that demon-strated the presence of dyes in the aquatic environment.Garrison and Hill (1972) found three anthraquinone
blue disperse dyes associated with textile discharges in
the Savannah River (USA). A study of the YamaskaRiver in Quebec, Canada detected 15 dyes in the river
water, in suspended solids, and in sediments down-
stream of textile mills ( Maguire, 1992 ). The identiﬁed
dyes included C.I. Disperse Red 60, C.I. Disperse Blue
26, and C.I. Disperse Blue 79. In addition, a mutagenic
reductive cleavage product and synthetic precursor ofC.I. Disperse Blue 79 (2-bromo-4,6-dinitroaniline) wasidentiﬁed in the sediment at concentrations of 0.1–
1.9 mg/kg, about 6 km downstream of the discharge.
In the aquatic environment, because azo disperse dyesare hydrophobic compounds, they are expected to be
adsorbed on the sediment and not be found in the water
column. However, because they are combined with dis-persing agents, commercial disperse dye products are
water-soluble. For this reason, the hydrophilic proper-
ties of the commercial products will be much higher thanthe dyes themselves. This allows an increased presence of
dyes in waters that receive eﬄuents from textile process-
ing plants employing such dyes.
Michaels and Lewis (1985) recognized that studies
about the chemical characterization of textile dye indus-
trial wastes are scarce even though dyes are present in
signiﬁcant amounts in the aquatic environment. Accord-ing to the authors, this is because the dyes are often
composed of mixtures of compounds with unknown or
unpublished chemical structures.
The Salmonella microsome mutagenicity assay is one
of the protocols routinely used in the Sa ˜o Paulo State56 G. de Araga ˜o Umbuzeiro et al. / Chemosphere 60 (2005) 55–64(Brazil) surface water quality monitoring program
(CETESB, 2003 ). In this program, Cristais River, where
water is treated for drinking water purposes, has repeat-
edly revealed low to moderate levels of mutagenic activ-ity according to the classiﬁcation of Umbuzeiro et al.
(2001) . Results of the Salmonella assay, using standard
as well as nitroreductase and O-acetyltransferase over-
producing strains, combined with diﬀerent extractionprocedures indicated that nitroaromatics and/or aro-
matic amines were causing the mutagenicity of the
environmental samples analyzed. The origin of the con-tamination could be attributed to a textile wet process-
ing plant that discharged its dye eﬄuent into the local
river ( Umbuzeiro et al., 2004 ).
Therefore, the objective of the present work was to
verify the possible contribution of dyes used by the tex-
tile plant to the mutagenic activity already detected inthe Cristais River using chemical analysis and muta-genicity assays. Accordingly, we used the following
strategy:
•veriﬁcation of the presence of representative dyes in
environmental samples collected in the Cristais River
using thin layer chromatography;
•evaluation of the mutagenic activity of the dyes
found in the environmental samples using the Salmo-
nella/microsome assay;
•determination of the chemical structures of the dyes
found in the samples, using nuclear magnetic reso-
nance (MNR) and mass spectrometry; and
•independent conﬁrmation and quantiﬁcation of the
dyes /C213contribution to the mutagenic activity of the
environmental samples tested using bioassay-directed
fractionation/chemical analysis.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity assay
We collected the following samples: the azo dye pro-
cessing plant treated eﬄuent, untreated Cristais River
water, treated water from the DWTP (located /C246k m
after the industrial eﬄuent discharge), and the DWTP
sludge. For the liquid samples, natural pH and acidic
pH organic extracts were prepared using XAD4(Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) as described by
Umbuzeiro et al. (2004) and for the DWTP sludge,
the extraction was performed by ultrasonication, alsoas described by Umbuzeiro et al. (2004) . Those extracts
were assayed for mutagenicity using metabolic activa-
tion with the strain YG1041 (HisD3052, rfa, Dbio,
DuvrB, pKM101), a nitroreductase and O-acetyltrans-
ferase overproducer ( Hagiwara et al., 1983 ). This strain
is derived from the Salmonella strain TA98 ( Maron andAmes, 1983 ). The method employed was the microsus-
pension assay ( Kado et al., 1983 ). Previous tests indi-
cated that this strain and condition was the most
sensitive for the detection of the mutagenic activity ofsimilar samples ( Umbuzeiro et al., 2004 ). The metabolic
activation was provided by Aroclor 1254 induced Spra-
gue Dawley rat liver S9 mix (MolTox, Boone, NC)which was prepared at a concentration of 4% v/v. Thepositive controls were 3 lg/plate of 2-nitroﬂuorene
(Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 0.5 lg/plate
of 2-aminoanthracene (Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,USA), both dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)
(Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Samples were
considered positive when a signiﬁcant ANOVA and sig-niﬁcant positive dose response were obtained. To calcu-
late the potency in number of revertants per lgo f
compound, liter-equivalent of water, or per gram-equiv-alent of sludge, we used the Bernstein model ( Bernstein
et al., 1982 ).
The black dye commercial product (BDCP), as well as
the three dye BDCP /C213s components were tested for muta-
genicity. This product was provided by the industry and
was chosen because of its wide use in the cited processing
plant process. The BDCP and its dye components /C213solu-
tions were prepared at 1 mg/ml concentration and the
doses tested were 200 lg, 100 lg, 20 lg, 2lg, and
0.2lg per plate in DMSO. The strains used were TA98
(HisD3052, rfa, Dbio, DuvrB, pKM101), TA100
(HisG46, rfa, Dbio,DuvrB, pKM101), and YG1041 in
the presence and absence of S9. In this case, we usedthe plate incorporation method ( Maron and Ames,
1983).
2.2. Chemical analysis2.2.1. Thin layer chromatography analysis
Initially, we performed a thin layer chromatography
(TLC) on the BDCP. The product (1 mg) was dissolved
in methanol (Merck KgaA, Darmstadt, Germany)
(0.2 ml) and an aliquot of the solution was spotted ontoTLC plates (Whatman PE SIL G/UV, cat #4410222,250lm layer, 20 ·20 cm) about 0.5 cm from the lower
edge of the TLC plate. The plate was developed in a
standard TLC chamber containing about 4.5 ml of tolu-ene (Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA):ethyl acetate
(Merck KgaA, Darmstadt, Germany) (8:1).
The presence of the BDCP was investigated in the
mutagenic organic extracts of the treated dye processing
plant eﬄuent, raw river water at the drinking water
treatment plant (DWTP), drinking water, and the sludgegenerated in the DWTP using TLC. As chromato-
graphic controls, we used 1 mg of the BDCP dissolved
in 0.2 ml of ethyl acetate. Volumes of 10 ll of the BDCP
solution and methanol extracts of the environmentalsamples were spotted onto TLC plates. This volume
contained the equivalent amounts of: 0.05 mg of BDCP,G. de Araga ˜o Umbuzeiro et al. / Chemosphere 60 (2005) 55–64 57100 ml of treated eﬄuent, 500 ml of raw and treated
water, and 200 mg of the sludge. To develop the TLC
plates we used 2 ml of a mixture of toluene:ethyl acetate
(10:1). After development of the plates, the dyes weredetected by visual inspection and reference factor (Rf)
values were recorded. For the evaluation of the presence
of ﬂuorescent compounds we irradiated the developedplates with short wave UV light (254 nm) and visuallyobserved the spots that showed ﬂuorescence.
2.2.2. Nuclear magnetic resonance and mass
spectrometry analysis
The colored components of BDCP were separated
using a 2.5 ·120 cm nylon membrane column packed
with silica gel (Fisher Scientiﬁc Company, USA). To
achieve the separation, 3.5 g of the commercial dye
was applied to the top of the column and developedusing toluene:ethyl acetate (8:1). After complete devel-opment, the column was sliced into sections to isolate
the diﬀerent colored bands. The silica gel sections from
individual bands were extracted in a Soxhlet apparatususing methylene chloride and the resultant solids were
dried in vacuum at 40 /C176C. The identiﬁcation of the com-
ponents of BDCP was performed using
1H NMR and
chemical ionization (CI) mass spectrometric analyses
(MS).1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker
500 MHz spectrometer. M+ions were produced by
high-resolution mass measurement using 70 eV electron
impact (EI) ionization. Mass spectra were recorded
using a Jeol HX110 double-focusing mass spectrometer(Foris, 1977; Van Breemen, 1995 ).
2.3. Bioassay-directed fractionation/chemical analysis
This part of the study was performed in order to con-
ﬁrm and quantify which compounds were the major
contributors to the mutagenic activity found in the envi-ronmental assays, in an independent experiment. The
group that developed this part of the research was una-
ware of our ﬁndings about the presence of the dyes usingthe TLC methodology at the time they started the work.Unfortunately, only the extract of the sludge generated
by the Cristais River DWTP was concentrated enough
to be analyzed by a bioassay-directed fractionation/chemical analysis technique, because this technique em-
ploys subsequent fractionation procedures where the
loss of material is quite substantial. The mutagenicity as-says were performed with the Salmonella strain YG1024
(HisD3052, rfa, Dbio,DuvrB, pKM10, O-acetyltransfer-
ase overproducer) ( Watanabe et al., 1990 ) in the pres-
ence of S9. YG1024 is very similar to YG1041, except
it lacks the overproduction of nitroreductase, containing
the same nitroreductase levels of the parental strainTA98. The strain YG1024 was chosen because thismethodology was previously validated with this strain
and the mutagenicity results compared well with thatof YG1041 (results not shown). The chemical 2-[(2-bro-
mo-4,6-dinitrophenyl)azo]-5-(diallylamino)-4-methoxy-
acetanilide (C.I. Disperse Blue 373, CAS registry no.
51868-46-3), used for the conﬁrmation step of the com-pound found in the samples analyzed, was synthesized
by the method reported previously ( Watanabe et al.,
2002) and used as a standard in the chemical analysis.
The sludge extract was fractionated into 25 frac-
tions (A1–A25) using a Sephadex LH-20 column
(20·400 mm) and a mixture of methanol:chloroform
(1:1) at 10 ml/fraction was used for elution ( Fig. 1 ).
The most mutagenic fractions (A8–A10) were fraction-
ated into 104 fractions (B1–B104) using Ultra Pack
ODS column (26 ·300 mm). For the fractions B1–B81
the elution was done with 75% acetonitrile and for the
fractions B82–B104, 100% acetonitrile, both at 6 ml/
fraction. For the most mutagenic fraction (B101) anYMC-Pack ODS-AM324 column was used, and 91 frac-tions were obtained (C1–C91), with 90% methanol for
0–20 min, 90–100% methanol for 20–60 min, and then
100% methanol (3 ml/fraction). Fractions C39 and C40were fractionated into 91 fractions (D1–D91) on a Luna
5 m phenyl–hexyl column (10 ·250 mm): 0–50 min 70%
acetonitrile; 50–70 min 70–100% acetonitrile and 70 min100% acetonitrile, at 3 ml/fraction. Fig. 1 summarizes
the steps of this technique. The UV-absorption spectrum
of the compound in the most mutagenic fractions, D31and D32, was recorded using a Shimadzu SPD-
M10Avp photodiode array detector. Moreover, the
compound in D31 and D32 was analyzed using anAgilent 1100 HPLC system coupled with electrosprayionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and a LCQ
Advantage instrument (Thermo Electron Company).
The aliquot was injected into a HY-Purity C18 column(2.1 ·150 mm) and eluted with 80% aq. methanol in
1% acetic acid at a ﬂow rate of 0.35 ml/min. Negative
ion mode (spray voltage: 4.5 kV; sheath gas: 50 arb, aux-iliary gas: 20 arb; capillary temperature 230 /C176C) was em-
ployed for the MS analysis. Mass spectra and retention
times for the compound in the fractions D31 and D32were compared to those of C.I. Disperse Blue 373. Inaddition, the presence of PBTAs (chlorinated 2-phen-
ylbenzotriazoles) and non-Cl-PBTAs (non-chlorinated
2-phenyltriazoles) was evaluated in the most mutagenicfractions by comparison of UV absorption spectra
peaks.

The results for the strain YG1041 in the presence of S9
were very similar to the ones obtained by Umbuzeiro et al.

and 7 ·103revertants/l-equivalent for the drinking water
produced by the DWTP. The sludge collected from theDWTP gave 4.7 ·10
4revertants/g-equivalent.
3.1.2. BDCP and its three dye components
The BDCP, which is a mixture of three dyes ( Fig. 2 ),
an aromatic amine, and unidentiﬁed dispersing agents
showed mutagenic activity with TA98 and YG1041 in
the presence and absence of S9. We observed a /C2420 fold
increase in the mutagenic response with YG1041 when
compared with TA98, both with and without S9. The
addition of S9 also increased the mutagenicity /C2420 fold
over the levels observed without S9, for both strains
(Fig. 3 A). The three isolated dye components of BDCP
were tested for mutagenicity using the same conditionsdescribed above, and they presented a similar mutage-nicity pattern as the BDCP ( Fig. 3 B–D). When S9 met-
abolic activation was used, the mutagenic activities of
the blue and violet components exhibited more pro-nounced increases than the orange component. For all
three components, the use of YG1041 when compared
to the results obtained for TA98 revealed the involve-ment of the nitroreductase and/or O-acetyltransferase
activity in the activation of these compounds ( Fig. 3 B–
D). We can conclude that the S9-containing P-450
CYP isozymes besides the nitroreductase and O-acetyl-
transferase are involved in the activation of this com-
mercial product as well as its dye components. In
comparison to the mutagenicity of the C.I. DisperseBlue 291 commercial product, we observed that the
BDCP and the blue and the violet components are more
mutagenic than the C.I. Disperse Blue 291 especially forthe YG1041 in the presence of S9. The mutagenicity of
the orange component was similar to the C.I. Disperse
Blue 291. The role of the nitroreductase and O-acetyl-
transferase obtained with the C.I. Disperse Blue 291was similar to the results obtained in this study. When
examining mutagenicity dependence on S9 metabolism,
the C.I. Disperse Blue 291 was less activated by theextract

and its components. No additional toxicological infor-
mation about the BDCP components was found in the
literature.
Comparing the mutagenicity of the commercial prod-
uct with its components, we can suggest that the dispers-
ing agents and other non-dye components do not aﬀectthe mutagenicity of the mixture, because the mixture
shows the same mutagenicity pattern as the individual
compounds and the potency seems to be a sum of theresponses of its dye constituents.
From these data, it is clear that the mutagenicity of
the treated eﬄuent could arise from the presence of thethree components of BDCP, because they are all muta-genic and the potencies are suﬃcient enough (6300;
4600, and 280 revertants/ lg for the blue, violet, and
orange components respectively) ( Fig. 3 B–D) to cause
the observed eﬀects. Also, the mutagenicity of the raw
water and sludge samples could be related to the presence
of the same dyes ( Fig. 2 ).
3.2. Chemical analysis
3.2.1. Evaluation of the presence of dyes in the
environmental samples using thin layer chromatography
Using TLC analysis, we observed Rf values and col-
ors comparable to the BDCP in both natural and acidpH extracts of the treated industrial eﬄuent, in the nat-
ural pH extract of the river water samples, and in the
DWTP sludge extract ( Fig. 2 ). Only the drinking water
did not contain dyes at concentrations above 0.02 lg/l,
which was the lowest observed limit (LOL) of the tech-
nique. This limit was calculated by spotting 1:10 serial
dilutions of a 100 lg/ml solution of BDCP.
BDCP is composed of three diﬀerent dye constitu-
ents: a violet (Rf = 0.43), an orange (Rf = 0.48), and a
blue (Rf = 0.59). We also observed a presence of a
non-dye yellow impurity (Rf = 0.66) ( Fig. 2 ). We found
that this impurity had the same Rf value as the aromatic
amine 2,6-dichloro-4-nitroaniline (DCNA) previously
detected by GC/MS in the industrial eﬄuent, riverwater, and drinking water samples from the same loca-
tion ( Umbuzeiro et al., 2004 ). It is relevant to point
out that other unknown dyes appear to be present inthe industrial eﬄuent sample ( Fig. 2 ). In addition,
TLC results from the environmental sample extracts,
excluding the drinking water, showed three ﬂuorescent
compounds designated here as FC1, FC2, and FC3 withRfs 0.45, 0.72, and 0.76, respectively. The chemical
structures of these compounds were not determined.
Further studies should be performed in order to charac-terize the chemical and mutagenic characteristics of
these compounds and to determine whether or not they
are also involved in the mutagenic activity of those envi-ronmental samples.
It is clear from these results that the activated sludge
treatment system used by the textile processing plant didnot provide eﬃcient removal of dyes. Also, the treat-ment was not eﬀective in removing components respon-
sible for the mutagenic activity. This is indicated by the
high levels (3 ·10
5revertants per liter) of mutagenic
activity detected in the treated eﬄuent samples analyzed
in this study. The low eﬃciency of the removal of dyes in
activated sludge systems was demonstrated by an US
EPA study (1989) in which 20% of a C.I. Disperse Blue
79 sample remained in the liquid eﬄuent after aerobic
treatment. The same type of treatment did not removemutagenicity with or without tertiary treatment thatused activated carbon ( Fracasso et al., 1992 ). Other pro-
cedures that combine anaerobic, with aerobic treatments
(An et al., 1996; Dubrow, 1996; O /C213Neill et al., 2000;
Rajaguru et al., 2000; Cruz and Buitron, 2001 ) and
strong oxidation processes like ozonation ( Ga¨hr et al.,
1994) seem to be more eﬃcient in the removal of dyes;
but unfortunately in those studies, the mutagenic activ-
ity of the raw eﬄuent and treated eﬄuent was not
evaluated.
3.2.2. Identiﬁcation of the structures of the components
of the BDCP using NMR
The separation and puriﬁcation of the components
were performed as described in Section 2, and the chem-
ical structures were identiﬁed using nuclear NMR and

The pattern of mutagenicity observed for the BDCP
and its components ( Fig. 3 ) can be explained by the
chemical structures identiﬁed ( Fig. 4 ). The increase of
the mutagenic response with the YG1041 in relation
to TA98 (Section 3.1) is probably due to the presenceof the NO
2groups in the dye components of the
BDCP. The other substituents of the molecule (e.g.,
N(CH 2CH@CH 2)2, OCH 3) could explain the increase
in the mutagenicity in the presence of S9 (Section
3.1). The mutagenic pattern of the BDCP and its com-
ponents is also similar to the mutagenic activity of therelated environmental samples collected in the CristaisRiver as previously reported by Umbuzeiro et al.

using bioassay-directed fractionation/chemical analysis
Among the diﬀerent samples analyzed in this study,
only the extract of the DWTP sludge was concentrated
enough to be analyzed by this technique (see Section2.3). After several fractionation steps and mutagenic
evaluation with YG1024 in the presence of S9, the major
mutagen found in the water treatment plant sludge ex-tract was the dye C.I. Disperse Blue 373. The structure
of the compound was conﬁrmed by MS spectra, UV
absorption spectra, and retention times of the mutagenisolated from the sample using authentic C.I. DisperseBlue 373. This dye accounted for 55% of the total muta-
genicity of the extract when it was tested with YG1024
in the presence of S9. This result is an independent con-ﬁrmation that this dye was an important contributor to
the mutagenic activity of the samples collected in the
Cristais River because we veriﬁed the presence of thisdye in all the samples analyzed in this study, except
the drinking water ( Fig. 2 ).
Because C.I. Disperse Blue 373 was present in the
river water and it is known to generate non-Cl-PBTA8or PBTA8 by reduction reactions and subsequent chlo-
rination ( Watanabe et al., 2002 ), one could anticipate
their presence in the sludge samples. The C.I. DisperseBlue 373 could be reduced under unknown circum-
stances and subsequently chlorinated during the treat-
ment of the river water at the DWTP, generating suchcompounds in the sludge. The PBTA compounds were
found as an important source of mutagenic activity inseveral Japanese Rivers that receive discharges from
wastewater treatment plants that treat eﬄuents from
textile dyeing operations ( Nukaya et al., 1997 ). The
PBTA compounds were not detected in sludge sampleevaluated in this study probably because the reduction
step was not occurring or they were generated in
amounts not detected by the applied methodology.
4. Final considerations
We can conclude that the components of the black
dye commercial product, BDCP (C.I. Disperse Blue
373, C.I. Disperse Violet 93, and C.I. Disperse Orange37), are present in the environmental samples arising
from discharges at a local textile wet processing plant ex-
cept for the drinking water sample analyzed. Addition-ally they are contributing to the mutagenic activitydetected in the same samples. This is the ﬁrst study that
directly relates the mutagenic activity of a river to the
presence of azo-dye compounds.
The various dye components and the associated
mutagenicity were not eﬃciently removed by the indus-
trial eﬄuent treatment and persist in the environment.Consequently, there is a need to evaluate alternative
treatment processes at azo dye processing plants in order
to reduce the levels of mutagenicity and amounts of dyespresent in receiving waters and sediments, e.g., in the
Cristais River.
We showed that the use of both chromatographic
methods like TLC and the Salmonella assay can comple-ment the evaluation of the water quality of samples
under the inﬂuence of dye processing plants discharges,
as well as the current protocols (e.g., COD, BOD,suspended solids) used to test the eﬃciency of eﬄuent
treatment processes.
The conventional treatment employed by the Drink-
ing Water Treatment Plant (DWTP) seemed to be eﬃ-
cient for the removal of dyes and ﬂuorescent
compounds, because they were not detected in the drink-ing water samples analyzed and were detected in thesludge extracts. On the other hand, the treatment is
not removing the mutagenicity related to the presence
of nitro compounds detected in the natural pH XAD ex-tracts and blue rayon extracts of drinking water from
the Cristais River ( Umbuzeiro et al., 2004 ). We suspect
that some uncolored mutagenic nitro-polycyclic com-pounds are being formed in the drinking water treat-
ment process and not being eﬃciently removed.
Experiments involving chlorination of this BDCP arein progress in order to determine which compounds
are formed and if they are related to this mutagenic
activity. Another possibility is that some other muta-genic nitro compound related to the dye processingplant is causing this activity. Eﬀorts are also currently
targeted toward analysis of blue rayon extracts of theBlue Component of BDCP (C.I. Disperse Blue 373)

niques to try to identify the compounds as well as their

Because the discharge of the azo dye processing plant
analyzed in this study seems to be indirectly aﬀecting the
quality of the drinking water, mutagenic dyes and possi-
bly other genotoxic substances present in this type ofeﬄuent should be better characterized toxicologicallybefore released into the aquatic environment in areas
where water is taken for human consumption. Other
human (via consumption of organisms) and ecologicalrisks also should be considered and evaluated in further
studies before considering the discharge of mutagenic
eﬄuent containing azo dyes in water bodies as a safeactivity.
