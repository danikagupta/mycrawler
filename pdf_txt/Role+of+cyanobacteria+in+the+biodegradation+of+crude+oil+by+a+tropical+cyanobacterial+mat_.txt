Introduction
The extensive use of petroleum and petroleum products leads 
to serious oil contamination of the environment, thus considerable 
interests were taken in microbial degradation and detoxification of these 
pollutants.  Microalgae play an important role in the environmental 
cleaning of pollutants.  Microalgae provide O2 to aerobic bacteria 
to mineralize pollutants and then take-up the released CO2 [1]. 
Furthermore, microalgae can help in co-metabolic degradation or 
produce biosurfactants and extracellular matters to enhance bacterial 
activity for increasing pollutant bioavailability [2].  Additionally, 
microalgae can accumulate hydrocarbons, and subsequently make 
those compounds available to the associated hydrocarbon-utilizing 
bacteria [3]. The cooperation of phototrophic microalgae and 
heterotrophic bacteria could potentially improve the degradation of 
environmental contaminants including oil pollutants [4,5].
Petroleum products contain thousands of individual hydrocarbons 
and related compounds.  Their main components are usually 
subdivided into saturates (n- and branched- chain alkanes and 
alkylcycloalkanes ) and aromatics (monoaromatic hydrocarbons and 
polyaromatic hydrocarbons). The less abundant resins and asphaltenes 
consist of more polar compounds, containing heterocycles, oxygenated 
hydrocarbons and aggregates with high molecular weight [6].  Given the 
complexity of oil pollutants, however, it is hard to find a microorganism 
species that can breakdown a mixture of pollutants completely [7], 
one microorganism can only degrade a limited number of crude oil 
components [8]. Oil-degrading mixed cultures with broad enzymatic 
capabilities would be required to achieve extensive degradation. Thus, 
an artificial microalgal-bacterial consortium was constructed by one 
axenic Scenedesmus obliquus and four oil-component degrading 
bacteria with known complementary degradative capabilities [9].
The present study was focus on the degradation process by this 
artificial microalgal-bacterial consortium. The main components of 
crude oil, saturates (alkanes and alkylcycloalkanes) and aromatics (alkylbenzenes and PAHs) were investigated respectively.  Denaturant 
Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) was used to monitor the 
population dynamics of the consortium, in order to elucidate the 
metabolic capabilities in correlation to the growth of the constitutors.
Materials and Methods
Microorganisms and culture conditions
BG11 medium was used throughout all the experiments. The 
composition was as follows [10]. (g.L-1 in distillated water): 1.5 NaNO3, 
0.04 K2HPO4•3H2O, 0.075 MgSO4•7H2O, 0.036 CaCl2•2H2O, 0.006 
citric Acid 0.006 ferric ammonium citrate; 0.001 EDTA, 0.02 Na2CO3; 
6.1x10-5 H3BO3; 1.69x10-4 MnSO4•H2O; 2.87x10-4 ZnSO4•7H2O, 
2.5x10-6 CuSO4•5H2O and 1.25x10-5 (NH4)6Mo7O24•4H2O.
The artificial microalgal-bacterial consortium formed by one axenic 
Scenedesmus obliquus  named GH2 and four oil component-degrading 
bacteria.  The axenic Scenedesmus obliquus  exhibited no oil degrading 
ability; but significantly promoted the degradation ability of other 
oil component-degrading bacteria [9]. The bacterial strains included 
Sphingomonas GY2B (Genbank accession number DQ139343) 
[11,12] and Burkholderia cepacia GS3C (Genbank accession number 
EU282110) [13] along with a mixed culture named GP3 containing 
Pseudomonas GP3A (Genbank accession number EU233280)and 
Pandoraea pnomenusa  GP3B (Genbank accession number EU233279)

Degradation process of crude oil by one artificial microalgal-bacterial consortium was described in this study.  The 
consortium was constructed by one axenic Scenedesmus obliquus  named GH2 and four oil component-degrading 
bacteria with known complementary degradative capabilities, including Sphingomonas  GY2B, Burkholderia cepacia  
GS3C, Pseudomonas  GP3A and Pandoraea pnomenusa  GP3B.  Results showed the consortium could completely 
eliminate alkanes, alkylcycloalkanes and alkylbenzens in 10 days, 7 days and 7days, respectively. No transformation 
in the composition of the saturated hydrocarbons upon the consortium growth. The consortium preferential attacked 
high molecular Polyaromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as phenanthrene and methylphenanthrenes, a lot of C2, 
C3 naphthalene isomers and some extra lower molecular substances were produced during the PAHs degradation.  
The total biodegradation rates of naphthalene, fluorene, phenanthrene and their derivatives were achieved about 
90%, 76% and 70%, respectively. The population dynamics of the microorganisms showed the degradation process 
closely correlated with the growth of bacterial strains.Biodegradation of Crude Oil by an Artificial Microalgal-Bacterial

Volume 1 • Issue 1 • 2012[14].  GY2B could only degrade polyaromatic hydrocarbons; GS3C 
was able to degrade aliphatic chain hydrocarbons, and GP3 could 
utilize both saturates and aromatic hydrocarbons [9] 2 ml (chlorophyll 
content was 2.62 μg/ml) algae culture and 1ml mixed (v:v:v = 1:1:1, 1.0 
× 107 cells/ml bacteria culture were initial inoculated into 30 ml BG11 
medium for the consortium construction, and the consortium culture 
were transferred into fresh BG11 medium once every 7days.
In the biodegradation study, 3ml microalgal-bacterial cultures were 
inoculated into100 ml flasks containing 30 ml BG11 medium. Oseberg 
crude oil was added as the initial concentration was 0.3% (v/v). Flasks 
were incubated at 25 ± 1°C with constant shaking at 150 rpm under a 
light-dark regime of 14:10 (illumination: 165  μmol photons/m2•s) by 
cool white fluorescent tubes (Opple, T5).  Samples were taken on the 
0 (original), 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 10 day, respectively, for chemical analysis, 
and all assays were carried out in triplicate.
Chemical Analysis
The residual oil was recovered from the culture with n-hexane.  
Biomass was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant oil 
recovered with the addition of 15 ml n-hexane, oil adhering to the 
microalgae or the flask was extracted ultrasonically with another 15 
ml n-hexane for 30 minutes, these two volumes were combined to a 
total of 30 ml final volume.  All the extracts were fractioned into four 
parts including saturates, monoaromatics, polyaromatics and polars, 
the saturated and aromatic hydrocarbons were analyzed by GC/MS as 
described by [9].
Population dynamics analysis
For the biodegradation assays with the microalgal-bacterial 
consortium, microorganism samples were obtained at every sampling 
time.  Cells were harvested by centrifugation and the biomass 
resuspended in TE (Tris-HCl 10mM, EDTA1mM, pH 8) buffer.  DNA 
was extracted from 2ml suspensions using the lysis/phenol method 
[15]. 0.5μl genomic DNA (60~100 ng/μl) of each sample was used as 
template for PCR, the 16S rRNA gene fragment was amplified with the 
primers 358F-GC and 907R [15].
DGGE was run in a DCode system (Bio-Rad), with a 6% 
polyacrylamide gel, and the gradient concentrations were 30% to 60%.  
The mixture (100 μl) of two replicated PCR products was loaded for 
each sample, the gel was electrophoresized at 80V for 15h at 60°C and 
then silver-stained.  The DNA recovered from excised DGGE bands 
were reamplified and sequenced by the Beijing Genomics Institute 
(China). 
Results and Discussion
Biodegradation process
Degradation processes of alkanes by the artifitial microalgal-
bacgterial consortium were showed in Figure 1. n-Alkanes had 
been completely removed in 4 days, while the group of isoprenoids 
was unchanged except slightly decrease of i-C14 alkane.  The more 
recalcitrant of isoprenoids for biodegradation would be attributed to 
the branched chemical structure, the presence of n-alkanes also made 
repressed action for i-alkanes degradation [6]. No n-alkanes presented 
and most of i-alkanes decreased since the 4th day. The group of  i-alkanes 
could also been eliminated in 10 days.
From the Figure 2, it can be seen that the homologues of 
alkylcycloalkane up to C9 were began to degrade in the 2nd day, the C5 
derivatives was eliminated and only a few C6 derivatives retained, but the homologues more than C10 remained constantly.  The long chain- 
alkylcycloalkanes decreased continuously since the 3rd day. Although 
cycloalkanes were reported as more recalcitrant oil components for 
biodegradation [16], the artificial consortium could removed all of 
these homologues in 7days.  Perry [17] reported isoalkanes were 
preferentially degraded than cycloalkanes, but that was not strictly valid 
in this study.  No transformation in the composition of the saturated 
hydrocarbons upon the consortium growth.
In the 2nd day, the artificial consortium could attacke the 
homologues of alkylbenzene up to C9, C4 and C5 derivatives were 
eliminated, and the homologues more than C10 kept unchangeably.  
The C10 homologues begin to degrade and C7 homologue was removed 
in the 3rd day, but the homologues higher than C11 still remained

Volume 1 • Issue 1 • 2012constantly. The long-chain homologues (with carbon numbers more 
than C12) dropped abruptly between the 3rd and the 4th day, most of 
these substances completely removed during this one day’s period.  All 
of these homologues were completely depleted in 7 days (Figure 3).
Figure 4 showed the mass spectrometric total ion current 
of the control and biodegraded PAHs.  Phenanthrene and the 
methylphenanthrenes were degraded about 90% and 50%; fluorene 
was eliminated and the C1, C2 derivatives were decreased about 
45%and 35%, respectively; naphthalene was eliminated and C4-
naphthalenes derivatives were depleted about 10% in the 2nd day.  A 
lot of C2, C3 naphthalene isomers and some extra substances, such  as 2-methyl-1-propylnaphthalene, 1-propylnaphthalene, 1-benzyl-3-
methylbenzene and diphenylmethane were augmentations in the 2nd 
day’s ion current (Figure 5). That suggested in crude oil mixtures, the 
carbochain and benzene ring of high molecular PAHs may be broken 
directly during the degradation process. Such as methylphenanthrenes 
may attaked by breaking one benzene ring firstly as 2-methyl-1 
propylnaphthalenes were the intermediate products, the fracture of 
the alkyl chains then transform 2-methyl-1propylnaphthalenes into 
C2, C3 naphthalene isomers. C4 naphthalene may also convert to C2, 
C3 naphthalene isomers by demethylation. 1-benzyl-3-methylbenzene 
and diphenylmethane might be attributed to partially fracture of 
fluorene and their derivatives.  Although a great deal work had been 
done on the pathway of oil components degradation, most studies were 
carried out by choosing one component as typical substance [12], the 
pathways of each component in bulk crude oil degradation have not 
yet been clearly delineated since there were too many complex mixture 
substances.  Essentially, it is hard to compare the degradation pathway 
of one component in crude oil with the same compound as single 
pure substance, because of the mutual effect between components; 
the intermediate products may also affect the degradation of other 
component.  Extensive research should be carried out on this topic.
In the 3rd day, the C2 naphthalene derivatives were eliminated, 
more than half of residual C3, C4 naphthalenes were depleted; C1 and 
C3 homologues of fluorene were decreased to around 40% and 10% 
of the initial quantity; phenanthrene was eliminated and about 30% 
and 40% of C1 and C2 phenanthrene were decreased; no additional 
peak emerged in the 3rd day’s mass spectrogram.  C2 fluorene were 
decreased to about 50% in the 4th day, other substances also decreased 
except C3 and C4 phenanthrene, which remains constant throughout 
the degradation process.
The major degradation of PAHs occurred in 5 days, no obvious 
difference between mass spectrum current of the 5th day and 10th day 
expect slight decrease of low molecular materials.  The residual oil 
contained a small quantity of C4 naphthalene, C1 and C2 fluorene, C2 
phenanthrene.  C3 and C4 phenanthrene are biorefractory and couldn’t 
be degraded absolutely.  The total biodegradation rates of naphthalene, 
fluorene, phenanthrene and their derivatives were achieved about 90%, 
76% and 70%, respectively.
Microorganisms’ population dynamics
To determine the microorganisms’ population dynamics during the 
biodegradation processes of crude oil, DGGE-profiles of the consortium 
were obtained at different culturing times (Figure 6).  GS3C and GP3A 
showed intense bands since the 2nd day, the brightness and density of 
GY2B rose sharply in the 4th day, while the band corresponding to GH2 
and GP3B increased gradually during the culturing times.
GS3C was more efficient in degradation of aliphatic chain 
hydrocarbons. GP3 (containing GP3A and GP3B could attack the 
aliphatic hydrocarbons but also degraded the aromatic hydrocarbons. 
GP3A belongs to Pseudomonas, which was reported as the most 
important genus of hydrocarbon utilizers [18]. GY2B was specialized 
and the most efficient in the degradation of PAHs [9] According to 
the DGGE banding patterns, GS3C and GP3A were predominated and 
mainly responsible for the aliphatic hydrocarbons degradation since 
the 2nd day.  The growth of GP3B achieve the stationary phase in the 
5th day,mixed culture of GS3C and GP3 would significantly promoted 
the degradation of alkylcycloalkanes [9] and the homologues of 
alkylcycloalkane were eliminated during the 5th to the 7th day (Figure 
2). GY2B were initially isolated by using phenanthrene as sole carbon

Volume 1 • Issue 1 • 2012source [11] and it has reserved preferential degradation property for the 
high molecular PAHs such as phenanthrene and methylphenanthrenes. 
The extensive decrease of PAHs leaded to sharp increase of GY2B in the 
4th day.  The cooperation of GS3Cand GY2B would cause co-oxidation 
of alkylbenzenes [9] the intensive growth of GY2B thuslead the long-
chain alkylbenzenes homologues dropped abruptly between the 3rd 
and the 4th day (Figure 3). The microorganisms’ population dynamics 
showed the degradation process closely correlated with the growth of 
bacterial strains and their metabolic activity.
