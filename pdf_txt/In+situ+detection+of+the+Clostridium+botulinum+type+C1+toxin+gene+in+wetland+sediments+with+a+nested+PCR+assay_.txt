Botulism in Lake Erie 
 Workshop Proceedings: 
 
Introduction  
 Introduction – Workshop Objectives    
 
 Responding to fish and bird die-offs along the shores of Lake Erie from  1999-2001, the 
staffs of New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio Sea Grant wanted to understand the extent of the  
die-offs, gather scientific inform ation and explore the ecological im pacts of these botulism  
outbreaks.  In order to achieve these goals, the Sea Grant program s realized a need to create a 
functioning network of involved agencies and i ndividuals and organize a workshop that would 
get this diverse binational group working together. 
 
 Working from  the success of the first conference on avian botulism  that was held in 
2001, New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio Sea Grant worked together to co-sponsor a workshop 
that was designed to develop a research agenda to deal with this ecological problem .  On 
February 28, 2002, a workshop on Botulism  in Lake Erie was held in Buffalo, New York.  That 
workshop brought together 100 researchers, fisher y and wildlife biologists, resource m anagers, 
and agency representatives.  The goal of the workshop was to share inform ation from  the 
American and Canadian shores and to develop a research agenda for future efforts. 
 
 The original conference, held on January 24-25, 2001, was co-sponsored by New York 
and Pennsylvania Sea Grant and was held in Erie, Pennsylvania.  That workshop focused on 
avian botulism , since at that tim e most mortalities were occurring in fish-eating birds like loons 
and m ergansers.  Organizers wanted to determ ine the extent of the avian botulism  problem  based 
on geography and environm ental conditions that existed during the outbreaks.  Although 
organizers realized that the first conference was prem ature from  a data standpoint, they wanted 
to create a functioning network of scientists who would collaborate on research issues and 
respond to future outbreaks. 
 
Botulism  in Lake Erie 
 
 Botulism , a disease caused by Clostridium botulinum, has been recognized as a m ajor 
cause of m ortality in m igratory birds since the early 1900s.  Although type C botulism  has 
caused the die-off of thousands of waterfowl (especially ducks) across the western United States, 
type E has been m ainly restricted to fish-eating birds in the Great Lakes.  Other outbreaks of type 
E have sporadically occurred in Alaska, Florida, and California, with periodic outbreaks 
occurring in Lake Michigan and Lake Huron over a twenty-year period beginning in 1964.  
During 1999 and 2000, a large die-off of waterfowl occurred in Lake Erie and type E botulism  
was isolated in these outbreaks.  In 2001, a large die-off of benthic fishes like sheepshead 
occurred along the shores, followed in the fall by another die-off of fish-eating birds. 
  
The bacterium  is classified into seven types (A-G) by using characteristics of the neurotoxins 
that are produced.  The toxins produced by C. botulinum are am ong the m ost potent biological 
poisons, warranting hum an health and safety concerns.  These neurotoxins bind to the receptors 
on nerve endings, im pacting neurom uscular function, which results in the paralytic effect on 
birds.  Im pacted waterf owl typically show signs of  weakness, dizziness, inability to f ly, muscular 
paralysis, and respiratory im pairm ent.  Of ten, the inner eyelid or nictitating m embrane becom es 
paralyzed, im pairing the bird' s norm al vision.   
 1 Although type C and type E avian botulism  outbreaks occurred in the Great Lakes in the 
past, there are som e significant differences between the two types.  Type C botulism  prim arily 
impacts dabbling ducks and bottom -feeding waterfowl, although shorebirds m ay also fall victim  
to this type of botulism .  In type C botulism , the bacterium , C. botulinum, does not produce toxin 
unless it is infected by a specific "phage" or virus.  This relationship with a phage is not known 
to exist with type E.  Type E botulism  typically im pacts fish-eating birds like loons and grebes.  
Several species of gulls that are com mon in the Great Lakes region have been im pacted by type 
C and type E botulism .  While live fish can carry spores of type E botulism , it is not known 
whether they can carry the toxin itself or becom e sick and die from  the toxin.  Type E toxin has 
been found in carcasses of several species of  Great Lakes fish, including round gobies, and 
researchers are studying the role this invader m ay play, if any, in recent outbreaks of the disease 
in Lake Erie. 
 
Spores of both type C and type E botulism  are naturally found in anaerobic habitats such 
as soils and aquatic sedim ents, and can also be found in the intestinal tracts of live, healthy 
anim als.  The spores can rem ain in the ecosystem  for extended periods of tim e, even years, and 
are quite resistant to tem perature extrem es and drying.  In the absence of oxygen, with a suitable 
nutrient source, and under favorable tem peratures and pH, spores can germ inate and vegetative 
growth of bacterial cells can occur (Brand, et. al  1988).   
 
Botulism  toxin is only produced during vegetative growth, not when the bacterium  is in 
its spore stage.  Decaying anim al and insect carcasses provide favorable conditions for botulism  
toxin production since the decay process uses up oxygen and creates anaerobic conditions 
(Friend, et al.  1996).   
 
It has long been known that type C botulism  is perpetuated through a carcass-m aggot 
cycle.  Researchers have now determ ined that type E botulism  can also be spread through this 
cycle.  Birds and fish that have died from  botulism  decay and becom e hosts for m aggots.  The 
maggots m ay contain the botulism  toxin and if fed upon by birds, the cycle is continued.   
 
The following illustratio n shows the cycle fo r Typ e C Bo tulism:

   Introduction – Human Health Considerations 
 
  
Hum an botulism  is typically caused by eating im properly canned or stored foods and 
norm ally involves type A or type B botulism  toxin.  There have been several fatalities during the 
1960s in the Great Lakes basin attributed to type E toxin, but these were caused by eating 
improperly sm oked or cooked fish that cont ained the toxin.  Hum ans, dogs, and cats are 
generally considered resistant to type C avian botulism  (Friend, et al.  1996).   
 
The toxin found in food item s will be killed by proper cooking of fish and waterfowl. 
When canning or sm oking fish or waterfowl, m ethods should be used that incorporate sufficient 
heat to insure that any toxins will be killed o ff.  Anglers and hunters should avoid harvesting any 
sick or dying fish or waterfowl, or those dem onstrating unusual behavior, in areas where avian 
botulism  has occurred.  People should not handle dead birds or fish with bare hands.  The use of 
gloves or an inverted plastic bag is recom mended in order to avoid risks.  If a diseased or dead 
bird is handled without gloves, hands should be  thoroughly washed with hot soapy water or an 
anti-bacterial cleaner.  
 
In case of a die-off, individuals are urged to  contact local agencies responsible for fish 
and wildlif e managem ent to notif y them  of fish and bird m ortalities.  It is im portant to record the 
location, type of birds or fishes, and num ber of carcasses found.  Stakeholders should follow 
agency recom mendations in handling dead fish and wildlife.  In certain areas, burying of the 
carcasses is allowed, in other areas incineration m ay be recom mended.  If birds are to be 
collected, they should be placed in heavy plastic bags to avoid the spread of botulism -containing 
maggots.

Brief Intro duction to Avian Botulism 
 
What it is  
- A paraly tic diseas e of birds caused by  a potent neurotoxin produced by  the bacterium  
Clostridium botulinum 
- Of the seven known serot ypes of C. bot ulinum  (A-F), two (ty pes C and E) cause 
paraly sis and death of waterfowl ( Rocke and Friend 1999 ) 
 
Types C and E compared  
 
Major similarity:  P rogressive sy mptoms in birds for both  types 
- Inabilit y to fl y 
- Paraly sis of the legs 
- Paraly sis of the inner e yelid and neck muscles  “li mberneck” condition - m ay lead to 
drowning 
- Respiratory  failure and death ( Rocke and Friend 1999 ) 
 
Major differences betw een Types C and E 
- Outbreaks of avian botulis m type C most often affect ducks 
- Type C outbr eaks have occurred on ever y continent e xcept Antarctica 
- Have killed millions of waterfowl 
- Most outbrea ks reported in  North America in the past 35 years have occurred west of 
the Mississip pi River ( Rocke and Friend 1999 ) 
 
Type E avian botulism 
- Outbreaks aff ect fish-eatin g birds: gulls (Larus  sp.) and lo ons ( Gavia sp.) 
- Type E outbreaks mostly confined to the  North Ameri can Great L akes 
- Isolated cas es docum ented in Alaska, Florida, and the the Salton Se a of   southern 
California ( Brand 2 001) 
 
How  Type C Clostridiu m botulinum  kills ducks 
- Spores of C. botuli num, type C, are widely  distribute d in wetland s ediments and can 
be found  in the tissues of most wetland inhabitants 
- Type C spores ger minate i n tissues that beco me anaerobic after an ani mal dies 
- Neurotoxin production  is dependent on a ssociation with bacteriophages that  carry the 
toxin gene 
- Wetland bird s beco me poisoned when t hey ingest fo od item s (usu ally invertebr ates) 
containing t he toxin  (Rock e and Friend,  1999 an d Williamson et al ., 1999 ) 
 
 6 
Wide distribution of Type E spores in environ ment 
- Spores of C. botuli num, type E, are found in m arine coastal sediments of Canada, 
Alaska, Gr eenland, and Russia, as well a s Great Lak es sediments 
- Spores are ca rried primarily by  bottom -feeding fishes in m arine hab itats ( Hyytia-
Trees 1999 ) 
- In the Great Lakes, spores  of C. bot ulinum, type E, are carried by  a wide variety  of 
fish, which are considered active agen ts for dissem inating the bacterium  (Bott et al. 
1966 , 1968) 
 
How  Type E Clostridiu m botulinum  kills fish-eating birds 
- Fish and aqua tic invertebrates ingest the spores during feeding and beco me a   
substrate for bacterial growth when they die ( Bott et al.19 66, 196 8) 
- Bottom -feeding fish m ay ingest foodstu ffs that includ e dead material already  
containing bo tulism  toxin 
- Birds may beco me sick wh en the y feed on: 
o Dead conta minated fish 
o Moribun d fish with t ype E neuroto xin in their gut  (Brand et al. 1983, 
1988 ) 
o Animals that feed on conta minated car casses 
 
A common feature of both types of Avian Botulism: The “carcass-maggot 
cycle”  
- Toxin produced in a decay ing anim al car cass i s ingested by  maggots 
- The maggotts are lethal to birds that eat the maggots ( Rocke and Friend 1999 ) 
- May account for some of the gull m ortalit y in outbre aks of both types of botulis m 
 
Diagnostic Procedures for type E Avian Botulism 
 
Phenotypic characteristics of Type E 
- Can grow and prod uce tox in at tem peratures as low as 3 ˚ C 
- Optim um growth occurs in the range of 25-37 ˚ C 
- Tolerates salt conditions up to 5% and a  pH as low as 4.8 (optim um 6.8-7)   ( Hyytia-
Trees 1999 )  
 
Why diagnosis of type E botulism as th e primary cause of a bird die-off in 
the Grea t Lakes is prob lematic  
- Neurotoxins of C and E t ypes of C. bot ulinum  produce the sa me symptoms in 
waterfowl 
- Both patho gen types m ay be involved i n large die-offs ( Fay 196 6) 
- Both are part of the natural bacterial flora  of the s ystem ( Bott et al. 1966, Williams on 
et al. 19 99) 
- There are other causes of botulism -like sy mptoms other than botuli sm, including  
algal or castor bean poisoning ( Rocke and Friend 1999 ) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 7 
What is ideally required to make a definitive d iagnosis?  
- Elim inating other possible causes of botulism-like poisoning in birds 
- Positive results from  each of three different procedures, including:  
1) Trad itional bacterio logical tests to  demonstrate th at a population of C. botulinum 
capabl e of producing toxin is present  in the environment  
2) Tests to i dentify the s pecific t ype(s) of C. botulinum isolated in th e env ironmental 
samples (sediment, water, or fish carcas ses) 
3) Tests to c onfirm  that moribund or recently dead birds contain the same type of 
botulism toxin that has been demonstrated in the environment. 
 
Environmental sample processing  
- First need to do tests for identification of C. botuli num Group II (t ypes B-F) as 
suggested in Buchanan (19 75) and CDCP (199 6) 
- C. botuli num can be grown in a variet y of enrich ment media that include a protein 
source (cooked m eat or meat extract), y east extract, an d a carbohy drate source 
(usually gluc ose), or meat- egg yolk media can be use d 
- Samples plac ed in enrichment media are  incubated in anaerobic containers at vary ing 
temperature s (25o-37o C) in either broth or agar cultures 
- Subsequent te sts of an isolate from  these cultures which conclude gr am positive 
bacilli with subterm inal (to central) endospores with appendages that are non-
proteol ytic an d ferm ent glucose, but not mannose to acid lead to th e conclusion t hat 
the organism  is a Group II Clostridium botulinum  
   
Conclusive tests for determin ing C. botulinum  type E utiliz e 
- Serological methods: Mous e bioassay , ELISA 
- Or genom ic methods: PCR-based methods using RA PD or nested PCR 
- Each technique has its advantages and disadvantages  (Recent revi ews in Williamson 
et al. 19 99 and Hyytia-Trees 1999 ) 
 
Mouse bioa ssay w ith seroneutralization  
- The traditional serological approach (e.g. Bott et al. 1966 ) requires antitoxins f or 
each of the C. botuli num toxin types possibly inv olved 
- Uses I CR strain m ice, and therefore requires an ani mal facility  and protocols 
approved by an institutional ani mal use committee 
 
Enzyme-linked immun osorbent as say (ELISA) 
- The serological alternative to the m ouse bioassay  
- Developed for detecting specific botulin um toxins ( Rocke and Friend 1999 ) 
- ELISA’ s are not commerci ally available  
- Hyytia-Trees (1999) believes that they  have not been adequately  evaluated  
 
Genomic methods based upon the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
- Have been de veloped to re place the mouse bioassay s for identify ing the various types 
of C. bot ulinum 
- Most of the PCR-based methods involve  extraction of the genom ic DNA fro m a 
culture-enriched bacteria populati on 
- Hyytia-Trees (1999) used a PCR-based method called RAPD (random ly amplified 
polymorphic DNA assay ) and pulsed-fi eld gel electr ophoresis to c haracterize the 
genetic variabilit y of type E isolates of C. botuli num found in fish sam ples 
 
 8 
Disadvantage of techniques using enri ched media to gro w bacteria prior to  
extracting DNA for P CR 
- May not provide an accurat e representati on of the abundance of toxin- producing C. 
botuli num cells in the natur al environm ent 
- Before concluding  that an y type of   C. botuli num identified in environm ental sam ples 
is a potential cause of a bird die-off, it s hould  be kn own whether there were sufficient 
numbers of  toxin-pr oduci ng, vegetativ e cells versus endospores, which are non-toxic 
and possibl y ubiqui tous in  the environm ent (Williamson et al. 1999 ) 
 
Nested PCR assay  
- Has been dev eloped for det ecting the bot ulism neurotoxin gene (Bo NT) for t ype C  
- Does not require prior processing of se diment sa mples in enrich ment culture 
(Williamson et al. 1999 ) 
- NWHC is wo rking on a m ethod of extracting DNA from  veget ative cells (while 
leaving spores intact) that would enable P CR to be us ed to assess t he prevalence  of 
toxin-pr oduci ng type C cells in environm ental sam ples (Williamson et al. 1999 ) 
- Hopefully , once these te chniques are availabl e, they  can be m odifie d for use with 
type E  
  
Final tests required to indicate w hether a type of C. botulinum  is the cause of 
a bird die-off  
- Requires obtaining blood s ample fro m moribund or r ecently  dead birds 
- Serum fractio n of blood obtained from  a bird is used in a m ouse bioassay   (with 
seroneutralization) or ELI SA tests 
- Problem  with  using the m ouse bioassay  to detect neurotoxin ty pe E in both dead 
birds and environm ental s amples: It may produce false-negative res ults, because the 
type E neurot oxin is u nstable in the envir onment (NWHC unpubl.  report) 
- Advantage of the ELISA test: has the advant age of be ing able to detect inactive a s 
well as biologically  active  toxin ( Rocke and Friend 1999 ) 
 
Comparative Analysis of Past and Cu rrent Type E Avian Botulism Outbreaks  
Past (historical) outbreaks: 1963-1983 
Current outbreaks: 19 99-2001 
 
Factors con sidered  
- Locations and Tim ing of Outbreaks 
- Outbreaks in relation to lake levels 
- Dietary  factors 
- Outbreaks in relation to changes in fisheries 
- The zebra mussel connecti on 
 
Location of avian botulism outbrea ks: pas t and present 
- Over two-thirds of the conf irmed type E die-offs from  1963  to 1983 occurred in L ake 
Michigan, and the rest occurred in adjoining Lake Huron ( Fay et al . 196 5, Fay 1966, 
Fay 196 9, Br and et al . 1983, Brand  et al . 198 8) 
- All but one of the current t ype E outbreak s have occurred in Lake Erie 
- An east-to-w est progression evident in the lo cations of major outbreaks in Lake Erie 
over the current three-y ear record of bird  die-offs especially  apparent along the 
Canadian side of the lake  
 9 
Seasonal timing of die-offs 
In bot h past and current o utbreaks: 
- Gull die-offs peaked so metime during the su mmer 
- Major loon,  merganser ( Mergus  spp.), and grebe ( Podiceps  spp.) mortalities 
occurred in th e fall, corresp ondin g to the timing of their m igratory  movements 
throug h the la kes 
 
Timing of b ird die-offs w ithin seasons 
- Noted that lo on die-offs in  the past out breaks often occurred in discrete episode s or 
“wave s” (Fay et al. 19 65; Fay 196 9) 
- Many  of the bird deaths reported in t he current series of out breaks occurred in 
episodes that appeared to follow m ajor storm events accompanying cold fronts 
- Coincidence of bird die-of fs following s torms was noted on b oth sides of Lake Erie 
in 20 00 and  2001 
- Indicates possible connection to lake t hermal phenomena  
 
Outbreaks in Relation to Lake Levels 
- Analy sis of h istorical hydr ological data for Lake Michigan-Huron (Fuller and  Shear 
1995 ) indicat es that the larger bird die-o ffs occurred during periods of ver y low o r 
rapidl y declin ing lake levels 
- Current outbr eaks are occurring dur ing a  significant p eriod of low Lake Erie levels  
 
Past outbreaks in relation to  Lake Michigan water levels 
- 1963  and 1 964, years of th e worst episodes of t ype E avian botulis m in the    past, 
were y ears of lowest levels for the perio d of record fr om 1916-199 3 
- Smaller events in 196 5 through 1968 corresponded to a period of gr adually 
increasing lake levels fro m the 1963-64 minimum (Fuller and S hear 199 5) 
- Among the o utbreaks reported from  1976-198 3, the la rger events (1976, 1983) were 
in years when seasonal lake level declin es fro m late su mmer-fall were    unusuall y 
steep in Lake Michigan ( Fuller and Shea r 1995 ) 
- Minor outbre aks in the inte rvening years o ccurred dur ing years of more typical l ake 
level fluctuations  
 
Current outbreaks in relation to Lake Erie lev els 
- 1999- 2001 type E die-offs co mmenced as Lake Erie water levels fell to their lowe st 
point in several decades 
- Question raised: What do water level cha nges have to do with  outbreaks of avian 
botulism ? 
 
Correlations w ith water level ch anges and Type C avian botulism 
- Water level fl uctuations (especially  summer draw-do wns in wetlands) have been 
identified as one of the environm ental f actors correlating with t ype C avian botu lism 
outbreaks ( Rocke and Friend 1999 ) 
- Draw-down events apparently increase t he am ount of substrate avai lable for  growth 
of C. bot ulinum, type C, by increasing the m ortality  of wetland invertebrates  
 
How  could this phenomenon apply to Type E outbreaks in the Great Lakes? 
- Perhaps sharply decreasing levels in Lake Michigan, Huron and Erie contribute to the 
productio n of carcasses su pportin g the growth of t he type E bacterium  
 10 
- Is there a link between low lake levels an d more frequ ent fish kills? 
- Summer anoxic conditions at bottom  develop sooner i n central basin of Lake Eri e 
when water l evels are low (Carey  Knight, Fairport Fis h Station, Fai rport, Ohio) 
- Perhaps low lake levels have a si milar eff ect on developm ent of isolated pockets of 
anoxia in the eastern basin  
 
How  pockets of anoxia may contribute to fish kills 
- Internal seich e by itself causes str ess to bottom  fish populations via rapid tem perature 
changes 
- Internal seich e may also di sperse anoxic waters fro m “isolated pockets” and 
compound t he stresses 
- Adult fish already  weakened by  spaw ning activity  may be especially susceptible 
(including  round goby males on nests – Cary  Knigh t) 
- Off-shore wat er tem peratures wer e at an all-ti me high level in the central basin of 
Lake Erie in the summer of 199 9 (Wellington  2001) 
- Perhaps war mer temperatures in the top half of the water colu mn additionally 
predisposed n ear-shore fish  populations t o therm al shock from  cold- water incursi ons 
during storm  events and internal seiche  
 
Dietary Factors - birds’ diets in pa st studies of type E avian botulism  
- Alewives (Alosa pseudoh arengus ) were the major food-item  in gizzards of dead gulls 
and loo ns examined in 19 63 and 1 964 die-offs ( Fay 1966 )  
- Experiments by  Fay dem onstrated toxicity of dead alewives (colle cted fro m Lake 
Michigan beaches) fed to captive ring-billed ( Larus delawarensis ) and herring gulls 
(L. argentatu s) 
- Dead ale wives collected fr om the bea ches a nd botto m (at a depth of 25 feet)  of  Lake 
Michigan found to contain sufficient levels of type E t oxin t o sicken kill gulls 
(Monheimer 1968 )  
 
Fish species  other than alew ife im plicated in p ast bird die-offs 
- Sculpins (Cottus bairdi ), smelt (Osmerus mordax ), yellow perch ( Perca  flaves cens) 
found in the gizzards of many birds kille d in the t ype E outbreaks i n 1963 and 1964 
(Fay 1966 ) 
- Type E toxi n found in high levels in decay ing carcasses of sm elt an d sculpins from  
lake Michigan ( Fay 19 69) 
- 1980  type E outbreak am ong gulls i n southern Green Bay  (Brand  et al. 1 983) 
corresponded to die-off of  alewife and suckers ( Catostomus  sp.) on the eastern s hore 
of Green Bay  
- Type E toxin detected in ca rcass es of burbot ( Lota lota), alewife, an d smelt found  on 
a beach at the  site of the 1983 loon die-off  ( Brand et al. 19 88), althoug h numbers of 
dead fish on beach were n ot “unusuall y large”  
 
Birds’ diets  in current outbreaks 
- Bones of sm all fish found i n the gizzards of m erganser s collected during 1999 
outbreak on  the Canadian shore of Lake Erie ( Campbell and Barker 1999 )  
- Gulls and loo ns exam ined in Penns ylvania in 200 0 also contained fi sh rem ains 
(Campbell an d Gauriloff 2001) 
- One Pennsy lvania loon co ntained a partially  digested gob y; one m erganser contained 
a mudpupp y (Necturus mac ulosus ) 
 11 
- Round goby reported to be main food item  in gizzards of loo ns and mergansers 
exam ined during the 2 000 type E die-off on the Canadi an side of Lake Erie (CWS 
unpu bl. repor t) 
 
Type E Avian Botulis m Outbrea ks in Rela tion to Changes in Fishe ries 
- Fay’s (1966) hunch: sugge sted possib ility of “som e connection bet ween the 
accumulation  of dead alewives and the bird m ortalities” 
- Link between ty pe E avian botulism  outbreaks and major changes in lake fisheries 
suspected wit h the first m ajor bird  die-of fs in Lake Michigan ( Fay et al. 1 965; F ay 
1965 ) 
- Fay (1965) reported that d uring the 1 963-1965 period,  the invasive alewife became 
the dom inant fish (reportedly 95%  by weight) in lake Michigan 
- Fay also noted that each year the alewife  die “en mas se,” (Fay 1966 ) 
 
How  published records  of changes in th e fisheries of La kes Michigan n ow 
confirm Fay’s (1966) suggestion  
- Alewives had  entered the upper Great Lakes before the 1950s, b ut their pop ulatio n 
did not begin to increase si gnificantly  in La kes Michigan and Huron until the 1960s 
(Smith 19 70) 
- The first period of rapi d alewife popula tion gr owth oc curred from  1957 t o 1963, 
immediately preceding the first major bird die-offs due to ty pe E 
- Second period of significa nt population increase by  alewives occurr ed from  1964-
1967, concurr ent with the second wave of t ype E outbr eaks  
 
Why massive die-offs o f alew ife occurred 
- Alewife i s not well adapte d to the ther mal structure of the Great La kes, which 
explains why  massive die-offs of the fish are co mmon (Christie 1974 ) 
- Adult alewife  apparently spend the winter in deeper water and then m ove inshore to 
spawn in the late spring 
- As the fish move from  deeper water to nearshore are as, they m ay traverse 
temperature g radients faster than the y can accli mate, resulting in death due to 
temperature shock (Christie 1974 ) 
 
Fisheries reports furth er substantiated 
- Annual, late spring die-offs of alewife,  producing m any dead fish on beaches an d 
nearshore lake bottom , were co mmon in the 196 0s (Smith 1970 ) 
- Alewife die-o ffs were apparently worse in Lake Michigan than in L ake Huron 
(Christie 1974 ), consistent with the initia l type E botul ism outbreaks being 
concentrated in Lake Michigan.   
 
Avian botulism type E outbreaks and fisheries changes in 1970s and 1980s 
- 1976  loon die-off (Brand et  al. 1 983) occurred durin g same y ear as unusual  sharp 
decline in the bottom -dwel ling slim y sculpin ( Cottus  cognat us) in Lake Michigan 
(Eck and W ells 1987 ) 
- Alewife populations in Lak e Michigan also declined sharpl y from  1975 t o 1977 
(especially  during the first year) 
- Alewife reco vered from  1977 t o 1979, then another s harp decline occurred in 1 980, 
correspondin g to the 1980 type E die-off  of gulls i n Green Bay  (Brand et al . 1983) 
 12 
- The y ear alewife populati ons fell to the ir ten- year minimum (1983) was sam e year as 
last major loon die-off in L ake Michigan ( Brand et al.  1988 ) 
     
Fisheries ch anges/die-o ffs and curr ent type E avian botulis m outbrea ks 
- Unusual fish and/or m udpu ppy die-offs  reported prior to or d uring many  (but n ot all) 
of the current  type E avian botulism  outb reaks  
- Most frequently m entioned species in th e current die-offs are nears hore bottom -
dwellers, incl uding sheepshead ( Aplodi notus gru nniens), mudpupp y (Necturus 
maculosus  - am phibian), rock bass ( Ambloplites rupestris ), smallmouth bass 
(Micropterus dolumieui ), round  goby (Neogobius mel anostomus ), and sturgeon  
(Acipenser fu lvesc ens) 
- Temperature intolerance related to storm and internal seiche phenomena has bee n a 
frequentl y cited explanatio n for die-offs (Murray 2001; Culligan 2001; CWS unpubl. 
report ) 
 
Possible key role of round goby in current fish and bird die-offs 
- Link to m oribund sheepshead found  by NYSDEC in August, 20 01 
- Similarities b etween round gob y invasio n of Lake Eri e and alewife populati on boom 
in Lake Michigan/Huron i n the 196 0s 
- Goby abun dance in annual trawl sam ples from  Lake Erie (offshore from  PA) 
increased fro m 4% of the total catch in 1997 to 95%  in 1999 ( Murray 2001 ) 
- Phil R yan’s observation (at Jan. 2001  avian botulism  conference) that expanding 
spatial distribution of goby appears corr elated with w est-to-east advance of ty pe E 
avian botulis m outbreaks (that continue d in Fall 2 001) 
 
Other goby facts suggesting a possible lin k 
- Initial introduction to Great Lakes via ba llast water discharged from a tanker from  the 
Black Sea ( Jude et al. 19 92) 
- Goby first sig hted in 1 990 north of Lake St. Clair; now is in all five of the Great  
Lakes ( Jude, 1997 ) 
- Goby populat ion apparentl y grew fastest in  Lake Erie (the shallowest and warm est 
lake), where principle food ( Dreiss enid mussels), were abundant: same location of 
current series of t ype E avi an botulism  outbreaks  
 
Goby connection may b est expla in why current avian botu lism ou tbreak is 
mostly conf ined to Lake Erie.  
  
Round goby ecology (similar to alew ife) 
- Apparent war m-water pref erence 
- Nearshore spawning habit  
- Predilection for overwintering in deep water both in B lack Sea ( Jude 1997 ) and Lake 
Erie (Carey  Knight – Ohi o) 
- Possible susceptibilit y to thermal shock  durin g internal seiche events, particularly 
when males are on nests (Carey  Knight)  
 
If gobies are a key element in the curren t series of avian botulism ou tbreaks, 
then w hy hasn’t the fis h been more prom inent in the re cent fish die -offs 
reported around the lake? 
 13 
- The possibilit y that the dea th of large num bers of small gobies coul d go unnoticed 
(Stone 2 000) 
- Dead gobies apparently  sink (Carey  Knight) or rem ain on bottom  
- Dead males o ccur regularly in trawl sampl es in Ohio ( Carey Knight ) althoug h not in 
very large numbers 
- Live gobies may  transm it botulism  toxin (from  food in their gut) t o other predat ors, 
includin g fish-eating birds or other fish ( NYSDEC) 
- Suggestion t hat live, m oribund fish trans mit type E t oxin to birds w as made in 
previous stud ies of bird die -offs in Lake Michigan ( Brand et al . 1983,1988) 
- Can account for puzzling t ype E m ortality of lo ons an d mergansers, which do n ot 
norm ally feed on dead fish,  and occurrence of bird die -offs in absence of obvio us 
fish-kills  
 
Possible role(s) of z ebra and quag ga mussels in avian botulism outbreaks 
- Ward Stone’ s suggestion that botulism  toxin in zebra mussels could be picked-up by  
feeding gobies and trans mitted to m ergansers and loons that feed on live gobies 
- Large die-offs of zebra or quagga m ussels are appar ently occurring, suggested by 
common observations of shell accu mulation on Lake Erie beaches following stor m 
events 
- Mussels may provide a m ajor source of decay ing anim al matter to f uel the growth of 
C. botuli num on the nearsh ore lake botto m 
- Dense mussel beds may  degrade water q uality (Sulliv an and Endris 1998 ), whic h 
may add to stresses experienced by  bottom-dwelling fishes  
- Live zebra mussels may play  a role in fish  die-offs by concentrating potential fis h 
toxins pr oduc ed by the alga  Microc ystis in Lake Erie ( Murphy 2001 ) 
 
Dietary factors supporting the z ebra/quagga mussel link 
- Mollusks are i mportant food items  in the diets of round gobies ( Jude 1997 ) 
- Mollusks also im portant in diets of she epshead and sturgeon i n Lake Erie ( Bolsenga 
and Herdend orf, 199 3) 
- Mudpu ppies are known to feed on m ollusks and carrion ( Harding 1 997) 
- Ingestion of dead zebra mussels conta minated with C. botuli num,  type E, m ay have 
contributed t o some of the recent unusual fish and am phibian die-off s 
 
Role of carcass-maggot cycle? 
- Summer-to-early -fall gull die-offs likely to be partly attributable to this cy cle 
- Overall role may  be m inor, if Lake Erie gulls feed m ore on live fish than carrion  
 
General Su mmary 
 
Common elements o f past and curren t type E avian botulism outbrea ks 
- The seasonal timing of gull  versus loon/ merg anser di e-offs and “episodic” character 
of outbreaks within seasons 
- Correlation o f type E avian  botulism  outbreaks with unusuall y low lake levels 
- Correlation b etween fish and bir d die-of fs, with some exceptional major bird di e-offs 
in the apparent absence of fish-kills 
- Probable role of an invasive fish species,  apparently adapted to warmer te mperatures, 
during a period of i nitial r apid populati on growth  
 
 14 
Unconfirmed difference betw een the past and current outb reaks  
- The potential role of invasive m ussels in  the current Lake Erie outbreaks 
 
Some questions for investigation suggested by these analyses  
- Do low lake levels affect off-shore or n earshore ecology  in wa ys that increase the 
likelihoo d bird- and fish-ki lls?  
- Are round goby  susceptibl e to thermal s hock from  cold water incursions, and are 
goby die-offs occurring tha t are not detectable at the s urface?   
- Are zebra or quagga m ussel die-offs supportin g the growth of C. botuli num,  type E, 
and/or are live mussels concentrating the bacteria or toxins?   
- Are moribund fish and/or  mudpuppies that contain t ype E toxin  responsible for 
outbreaks involving birds that norm ally do not eat dead fish?

Pennsylvania – 2001
•> 20 species affected
•Die-offs noted from April to 
October
•Nearshore, bottom-dwelling 
species most affected
Patterns and Trends in Fish Kills
•Fish species most frequently 
reported, in order of 
decreasing frequency:
-Sheepshead (drum)

Timing and Locations of Fish Kills
•Early season kills (April –
June) involved a wide 
variety of species and were 
concentrated in bay-connected habitats of 
Presque Isle
•Most of the late season kills 
(July – October) were at locations east of Presque 
Isle, at the southwestern 
edge of the eastern basin of 
Lake Erie (sturgeon, drum, 
mudpuppy)
Unusual Turtle Die-offs:
(mostly observed on the bay side of 
Presque Isle from April to July)
•Softshell turtles 
(several); one sick one diagnosed with TB by the 
NWHC
•Map turtles (several)
•Snapping and musk 
turtles (1 each)
•Good News: lots of live 
turtles (apparently Map turtles) observed at 
Presque Isle’s Misery Bay in the fallSoftshell Turtle

Dead Bird Reports East of 
Presque Isle in PA
•Great blue heron (1)
•Cormorant (1)
•Occasional “long-
dead” gulls
Algae Problems Noted by 
Wellington
•Most reported as incidents separate 
from fish and turtle die-offs
•Large accumulations of dead, rotting 
Cladophora in mid-late July
•Late July bluegreen algae bloom at 
Presque Isle’s Horseshoe Pond: 
Anabaena and Microcystis
Zebra Mussels
•Plate sampler pulled 
from Presque Isle 
Marina in mid-October 
found to be less populated than in past
•Numbers approximately 
one-third the densities observed 10 years ago
•Secchi disk readings 
less than 2-3 years ago, 
apparently more algae due to less zebra mussels

•Less than half as many dead birds found in 2001 
compared to 2000
•Few specimens sent to NWHC for determination of 
cause of death
•Gulls were the most commonly affected species, 
followed by loons; no mergansers this year
•Timing of gull and loon die-offs similar to prior years 
when Type E botulism was demonstrated to be the 
cause of bird deaths: gull die-off mainly in summer, 
loon die-off in fall

Notes on Improvements in Procedure for Disposing 
of Dead Birds Collected at Presque Isle State Park
By Harry Leslie – DCNR Presque Isle State Park, Park 
Operations Manager
•Main problems encountered in 2000:
• Union concerns with safety issue of 
maintenance crew burning dead birds in a homemade incinerator unit
• Concerns about handling dead birds, 
fall-out of ash material, and foul odors  
of decaying specimens
Improvements made in 2001:
•Cooperative arrangement made with Erie 
County Humane Society (no cost)
•Birds collected from beaches were double 
plastic-bagged, and placed in a large chest freezer in park maintenance area for temporary storage 
•Dead (frozen) bird carcasses transported once 
per week by dump truck from park to Humane 
Society incineration unit (five miles from park), and included with their incineration work
•Park maintenance crew was pleased with the 
arrangementsKenneth Roblee

Botulism Caused Waterbird Mortality in New  York Waters of Lake Erie - 2001 
 
Departm ent of Environm ental Conservation (DEC) staf f in Region 9 are f amiliar with 
repeated outbreaks of  type C botulism  which cause heavy m ortality to m allards f requenting 
sewage contam inated watercourses in the Buffalo m etro area.  Type E botulism  and its 
devastating effect on m igrating waterbirds is a new phenom enon to the western New York 
region.  The first outbreak of this disease during Novem ber 2000, killed an estim ated 5,400 
waterbirds on Lake Erie and was reported at the Avian Botulism  in Lake Erie W orkshop held at 
Erie, Pennsylvania in January 2001. 
 
In 2001, waterbird m ortality from  type E botulism  continued in Lake Erie with the first 
reports of dead ring-billed gulls being received on June 27.  The sum mer of 2001 was notable for 
heavy die-offs of fish including, am ong others, sheepshead, sm allmouth bass and rock bass. 
The shoreline at m any locations was littered with f ish carcasses, m ats of algae and spent m ussel 
shells, either zebra or quagga.  Ring-billed, herring and great black-backed gulls were observed 
foraging in this m ix of debris and specifically on fish carcasses.  Other dead birds species 
collected along the Lake Erie shore during this period included double-crested corm orants and a 
bald eagle.  DEC’s W ildlife Pathology Unit subsequently confirm ed type E botulism  in ring-
billed gulls, corm orants and a bald eagle.  In Septem ber 2001, shorebirds were observed dying 
and 23 sanderlings, 1 dunlin and 1 sem i-palm ated sandpiper were collected.  Type E toxin was 
identified in the ingesta of the sanderlings and the sandpiper.  No attem pt was m ade to quantify 
the m ortality to these species during sum mer, but it is expected that several thousand gulls were 
affected. 
 
In anticipation of repeated com mon loon m ortality during the fall m igration, shoreline 
transects established in 2000 were relocated and identified.  Sixty-five 100m  transects were 
relocated using a hand-held GPS unit and m arked with flagging.  The transects were surveyed 
once each week for 10 weeks beginning in early October.  This required the trem endous task of 
inspecting, recording observations for and collecting dead birds and fish from  a total of 65,000 m  
of Lake Erie shore.  Table 1 provides a sum mary of  the predicted waterbird m ortality f rom the 
2001 surveys.  Predicted m ortality values for all of New York’s shoreline were calculated by 
multiplying the m ean num ber of birds killed per 100 m  by 1,185, the num ber of 100 m  transects 
possible along the shoreline.  Som e major differences between the 2000 and the 2001 m ortality 
are apparent in com parison of the data.  The com mon loon m ortality of 1,149 predicted from  
transects in 2001 was nearly double the m ortality of 583 predicted in 2000.  Although this 
increase could be attributed to a longer survey period during the later year, the author believes 
that loon m ortality in 2001 was in fact higher than the previous year.  This is because the 2000 
transects were surveyed on the Novem ber 28 and 29, late enough to cover the m ajority of the 
mortality observed during the extended survey period in 2001.  It is assum ed that birds dying 
previous to the Novem ber 28-29 survey dates would have accum ulated on the shoreline and 
would have been observed and counted.  Doubl e-crested corm orants, greater scaup and long-
tailed ducks were found dead on transects in 2001, but not in 2000.  Greater scaup and long-
 20 
 tailed duck were also confirm ed as positive for type E botulism  in 2001.  The predicted herring 
gull m ortality of 401 was nearly double the 237 predicted in 2000, while the predicted ring-billed 
gull m ortality of 510 was less than one third of the 1,714 predicted for 2000.  Again, this 
represents only a portion of  the gull m ortality as gull m ortality was not m easured prior to 
October.  Horned grebes were not found on transects in 2001, although they were observed in 
2000.  Especially noticeable was the decline in the predicted red-breasted m erganser m ortality 
from  2,479 in 2000 to 91 in 2001.

Figure 1 depicts waterbird m ortality observed in transects chronologically.  It is 
important to note the decline in gull m ortality observed in October to the relatively low levels 
observed in Novem ber and Decem ber.  Healthy herring gulls and ring-billed gulls were observed 
within and near transects during these later m onths and did not seem  to be as susceptible to type 
E botulism .  A decline in f ish m ortality and the resulting availability of  fish carcasses was also 
observed during this period and m ay be related to the im proved gull survival.  The highest 
number of dead loons was observed on transects during the week of Novem ber 12.  This is 
believed to represent high m ortality to a large flight of loons into Lake Erie, im mediately prior to 
 21 
 this date.  Dead loons observed on transect surveys, during succeeding weeks, appeared m ostly 
to have died during this early event, as the carcasses observed exhibited a progressively 
decom posed state and few if any fresh carcasses were observed.

 Transect survey results indicated that l oon m ortality in 2001 was distributed throughout 
the New York shoreline.  Figure 2 depicts transects with loon m ortality.  In order to determ ine if 
loons were present on Lake Erie after the heavy m ortality observed during the week of 
Novem ber 12,  aerial surveys of Lake Erie were conducted for waterbirds on Novem ber 20, 
Decem ber 4, 2001, and January 2, 2002.  Surveys were lim ited to New York waters, except on 
Decem ber 4, when a search of the waters near Long Point, Canada, was included (it was thought 
that Long Point could be a source of loon carcasses drifting into New York waters).  Com mon 
loons were detected only during the Decem ber 4 flight (Figure 3), when 4 living loons were 
observed offshore of Eighteen-m ile Creek in New York, and 7 living loons were observed near 
the east tip of Long Point in Canada.  It should be noted that all loons were observed within 
about 1 m ile of the shore.  The num ber of loons observed is sm all com pared to the 1,149 
predicted m ortality to loons 3-weeks prior to this date.  Especially disturbing is the lack of loons 
observed during the Novem ber 20, 2001 flight.  Loons  are reported to rest on the Great Lakes for 
approxim ately 1 week, during m igration.  More loons should have been observable on the lake 
only 8 days after the high m ortality event recorded beginning Novem ber 12.  Currently, the 
mortality rate to loons which m igrate through Lake Erie is unknown, but expected to be high.  
The aerial surveys indicate that significant num bers of loons were not lingering on Lake Erie on 
and after Novem ber 20.  Any surviving loons m ust have left Lake Erie prior to or im mediately 
after the Novem ber 12 event. 
 
As m entioned previously, transect surveys indicated that red-breasted m erganser 
mortality in 2001 was reduced substantially from  that observed in 2000.  In addition, the location 
of mortality was restricted in 2001 to transects at W oodlawn Beach State Park at the extrem e 
eastern end of New York’s Lake Erie shoreline (Figure 4).  Transect surveys com pleted in 2000 
showed red-breasted m erganser m ortality was m uch m ore widespread, occurring on 48 of  65 
transects, and distributed throughout the New York shoreline (Figure 5).  Aerial survey indicated 
that m ergansers were present in sm all num bers (21) along the New York shoreline on Novem ber 
20 (Figure 6).  Com mon and red-breasted m ergansers were observed during aerial surveys and 
could not be reliably differentiated during count s.   Succeeding aerial surveys on Decem ber 4, 
2001, (Figure 7) and January 2, 2002 (Figure 8) showed that m ergansers were widespread along 
the shoreline by these dates in substantial num bers (690 and 669), although m uch less than the 
2,479 red-breasted m ergansers predicted killed in 2000.  The aerial survey data indicate that in 
2001 flights of m ergansers entered Lake Erie afte r the date of high m ortality of loons (Novem ber 
12, 2001) for that year and for the previous year (Novem ber 16).  Upon their arrival very little 
mortality was observed and seem s to indicate that type E toxin was not readily available to these 
birds at this tim e.

The Jul y to Sept ember peri od fish and bi rd die-offs we re report ed by various ci tizen and governm ent agent s along 
the Canadian shorel ine of Lake Eri e starting in late June .  Fish die-off events of sm all to m oderate scale are a 
relatively norm al occurrence along certain shore reaches of the north shore.  Citizens living in these areas have 
observed these in the past and are not generally alarm ed by such events when  they occur.  In  recent years, the 
numbers of dead fi sh has i ncreased dram atically with the increased occurrence of round gobi es in these di e-off 
event s.  Fol lowing is a chronol ogy of di e-off event s report ed in 2001. 
 
July 31:  Reports of dead bi rds and fi sh east  of Port  Dover associ ated wi th a rapi d drop i n water temperature in the 
near shore area.  Si milar event  occurred i n the area of Dunki rk, New York, duri ng the sam e week.  B irds involved 
were prim arily gulls.  One report included 30 dead gulls on the beach east of Port Dover, with som e num bers of 
dead gul ls observed as far east  as the mouth of t he Gra nd R iver.  Gul ls and shorebi rds were report ed from  Point 
Pelee Nat ional Park, as wel l, but no report s of large num bers of  dead bi rds ot her than at  Port Dover.  Gulls collected 
from Port Co lborne at th e mouth of the Welland Canal tested  positive for botulism type E.  Twen ty dead ring-billed 
gulls encountered on south beach of Long Point National W ildlife Area and 2 sick birds exhibiting botulism  type E 
symptoms, but none were col lected for t esting.  Several  hundred apparent ly heal thy corm orant s and gul ls foragi ng 
and roosting along the north shore of Long Point.  No dead fish observed on north or south beaches. 
 
August 16:  Fish die-off at W heatley di d not result in any unusual bird m ortalities, but had large num bers of gulls 
foragi ng on t housands of dead or dy ing gobi es for several  days.  A si milar fish di e-off/ lake thermal event  occurred 
along the shoreline from  Port Dover to po ssibly Port Colborne on the sam e day.   Higher num bers of bird m ortalities 
were reported early in the week and were investigated on Augus t 23 and 24th at beaches between Hoover Point and 
Featherstone Point where 38 dead bi rds, 1 m udpuppy and 3 shorebirds were  counted by a citizen.  Canadian 
Wildlife Service collected 4 birds for blood sam ples and several dead ring-billed gulls, black-backed gulls, 2 
Caspian terns, 13 corm orant s).  Earl ier in the week, 2 great  blue herons were pi cked up by  local animal cont rol 
agency  as si ck ani mals (Jeff R obinson observed anot her a pparent ly sick heron on an offshore i sland, but  was not  
able to get out to the islan d).  In the area th ere were n umerous apparently health y ring-billed gulls, co rmorants, 
Caspian terns, m allard ducks, C anada geese and great  blue herons.  The onl y dead fi sh evi dent on the shore were 
freshwat er drum  (sheepshead) and t he citizen report ing indicated he had not  seen any  remarkabl e num bers of dead 
gobies or ot her fi sh on t he shorel ine.  He not ed there ha d been som e higher num ber of dead bi rds evi dent last fall 
when si milar die-offs had occurred el sewhere, but  it was not  report ed at the time.  Duri ng 2002 t here were m ore 
dead bi rds than last year.  Jeff R obinson vi sited the citizen agai n on August  24, and pi cked up 2 m ore dead 
cormorants and 1 ring-billed gull and 1 black-backed gull wh ich were all th e new dead birds from the day before.  
 
Staff of the Long Beach Conservation Area east of Lowba nks had been encountering num erous dead gulls on their 
beaches for several days, but had not noticed unusual num bers of dead fish or mudpuppies.  Picked up 3 ring-billed 
gulls and 1 black-backed gull from  staff, as well as 1 ring-billed gull from  the b each area where 14 had been 
reported earlier in  the day.  
 
West of Lowbanks:  Surveyed a beach  where a dead bald eagle had been reported on August 23.  The dead eagle 
was not found (the citizen was quite confident it was an eagle , as he correctly identified black backed gulls also on 
the beach there).  Picked up several d ead ring-billed gulls, black-backed gulls and corm orants on this beach (1 gull 
and 1 corm orant were banded).  This beach is within sight of Mohawk Island Nati onal W ildlife Area which has 
nesting col onial water birds (gul ls, corm orant s and t erns) on i t which are m onitored for cont aminants and 
product ivity by Envi ronm ent Canada/ Canadi an Wildlife Serv ice personnel  on a regul ar basi s.  On August  23, t he 
island was vi sited by researchers who not ed the following:  approxi mately 30 dead doubl e-crest ed corm orant s 
(hundreds of l ive ones) and several  sick ones;  50 dead C aspian terns including a few chi cks; 10 dead great  black-
backed gulls; an d a few d ead ring-billed and herring gulls.  Th ere were also  2 sick ring-billed gulls; lyin g on their 
backs; also noted about 5 dead gulls on the east pier at  Port Maitland (but none were  retrieved).  The citizen 
report ing the bal d eagl e indicated that other dead bi rds had been gat hered up earl ier in the week and burned by  
another individual.  
 
 28Rock Poi nt Provi ncial Park report ed dead gul ls, corm orants and shorebi rds were bei ng col lected and buri ed by 
maintenance staff.  A citizen just we st of Port Maitland reported dead corm orants, gulls and fish as well on August 
25.  They  report ed dead 8"cat fish and drum , but no gobi es in any num bers.  
This die-off seem s related to a lake thermal event  triggered by  a storm with moderat e to strong nort h winds on 
August  17.  
 
Canadian W ildlife Servi ce staff on Long Poi nt National Wildlife Area just  west  of this report ed die-off di d not

smaller n umber were relativ ely fresh  or sick, but still aliv e.  W e retriev ed 1 cormorant, 1 black-backed gull, 1 ring-
billed gull and 1 immature herring gull aliv e for analysis at CCW HC.  Test resu lts were n egative for seru m, but 
birds exhibited classic sym ptoms.  Ring-billed gulls observed included a high pr oportion of birds which died at the 
end of t he nest ing peri od likely from  other nat ural causes f ound i n colonial waterbird col onies.  Si x live, but  sick 
shorebirds were also captured for a ssessm ent at th e CCW HC (th ese included a lesser yello w-leg s, a sem i-palmated 
plover, a whi te-rum ped sandpi per).  Al so, approxi mately 6 more dead shore-bi rds were col lected for possi ble 
analysis at th e CCW HC, with  the live shorebirds.  Mo st shorebird remains were relativ ely fresh .  The blue-winged 
teal had been dead for som e time, one skel eton had t he wings det ached as i t had been obvi ously scavenged and t he 
other was an articulated skeleton.  Th e 2 m allards were m ore recent deaths, but were not usable specim ens.  W e 
count ed 63 corm orant  nests on t he island.

• Counted 19 sheepshead, 2 rock bass, 2 gobi es and 2 seagul ls 
East of Peacock Point – sandy  bay with Cladophora on beach 
• Counted 15 sheepshead, 1 rock bass, 1 bul lhead, 1 st one-cat , 3 corm orant , 2 seagul l and 1 great  blue heron 
(collected) 
General  Comments: 
• Strong winds on the weekend brought fish into beach on weekend, but offshore wind m ay have carried som e 
away  (Sunday  night) 
• Fish had been dead for a few days to a week 
• Recent m ortalities of birds had occurred – 1 seagull, 3 corm orants, 1 heron 
Burbot were not  full sized, and m ay be immature fish.  Observat ion is significant as burbot  unlikely to bloat and 
wash up on beach. 
 
Septem ber 18:  Report of 20 dead gulls on beach on west side of Rondeau Provinc ial Park.  Park staff investigate, 
but no specim ens retrieved for testing.  No large scale m ortalities encountered s ubsequent to this.  Som e dead gobies 
noted in sam e beach area.  Continued reports of sick or dead birds from  beaches east of  Port Dover to Lowbanks.  
 
Octo ber 5:  Sixteen black-backed gulls rep orted from Pelee Islan d in western  Lake Erie with  specim ens submitted to 
Guelph (no positive test fo r botulism type E). 
 
October 19:   Bird wat chers report  seeing loons fl ying ove rhead i n the London area;  co-operat ors on bot h sides of 
lake alerted to watch for sick loons in the eastern basin east of Port Dover.  Public reports dead corm orants on beach 
at Bu rlington, on Lake Ontario, which Canadian Wildlife Serv ice staff in vestigate an d determine mortality was d ue 
to wire strikes.  Som e report s of dead bi rds cont inue. 
 
October 29:  Storm s over the previous 2 days on Lake Erie.  Check beach  areas from  Port Bruce to Lowbanks for 
dead birds.  Low num bers of birds encountered, one dead com mon loon at Hoover-Featherstone Point beach area 
where hi gh num bers of gul ls had been encount ered i n August  and Sept ember.  
 
Novem ber 3:  Telephone cal ls in morning of num erous l oons  com ing ashore dead and al ive east  of Port  Dover.  No 
live loons are encount ered on t he site visits, but many are observed and col lected for bot ulism testing.  C ounts are 
not done on t his day as the ext ent of the shorel ine effect ed and at tempts to gather fresh speci mens are pri ority. 
 
Novem ber 15:  Counts of dead birds on known beach areas are conducted for 1 km  at each area.  Port Bruce and 
Port Burwell each have 1 loon per kilom eter.  Long Point has 35 loons, which is approxi mately 1 loon per kilom eter 
of shoreline surveyed.  Port Dover beach has no loons on the beach surveyed, but is  the only beach with high 
numbers of di ving ducks (12 scaup, 4 re d-breast ed mergansers, 1 grebe and 1 whi te winged scot er).  Feat herst one t o 
Hoover Point; 60 red-breasted m ergansers, 35 com mon loons , 1 grebe, 2 long-tailed ducks, 2 ring-billed gulls, 3 
scaup. Knights beach area, 1 corm orant, 33 loons, 2 ring-billed gulls.  Shoreline opposite Mohawk Island, 7 
common loons, 1 bl ack-backed gul l, 1 long-t ailed duck.  Lowbanks, 5 com mon loons, 1 bl ack-backed gul l, 1 long-

Ward Stone, NYS Department of Envi ronmental Conservation’s Pathologist 
 
Ward Stone provided an overvie w of NYS DEC’s work with the botulism  outbreak in New 
York’s waters of Lake Erie, in cluding the f ollowing inf ormation: 
 
The Delm ar, New York, Laboratory took in 1,000 lb s. of loon in one shipm ent alone during • 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• the height of the avian die-offs in 2001. 
 
Old Squaw (Long tailed ducks) that tested pos itive for Type E botulism  were feeding on 
quagga m ussels (Dreissena bugensis ). 
 
Type E botulism  diagnosed was first found in Lake Erie in 1999.  The NYSDEC lab first 
diagnosed type E botulism in the fall of 2000. 
 
2001 - Type E botulism  was found in fish alimentary canals (in gut content). 
 
2001 - Type E botulism  was found in sheepsh ead, both in gut and tissue sam ples. 
 
2001 - Type E toxin was found in mudpuppies (salam ander-like, aquatic amphibians). 
 
Mats of Cladophora , a filam entous algae, were f ound during som e of the outbreaks. 
 
Shorebirds were im pacted.  Sanderlings were found with type E botulism.  The birds were 
feeding on m agots from dead sheepshead. 
  
Maggots (fly larvae) – had type E toxin.  
 
Bald Eagle – Hatched in 2001 Delaware River (Peter Nye) was found dead in Chautauqua 
County near Lake Erie.  The bird tested pos itive for Type E botulism .  The eagle had 
large f ish in gulle t, inc luding sm allmouth bass. 
 
Type E botulism  was found in the follow ing species of birds: common loon,   
double-crested corm orant, long-tailed duck, red-breasted m erganser, ring-billed gull,
 herring gull and grea t black-back ed gull. 
 
Mudpuppies and round gobies were f ound inside som e of the gulls. 
 
Mudpuppies were found in som e of the mergansers and loons. 
 
 Despite three years of mon itoring the Lake Erie outbreaks,  the NYSDEC has been unable 
to determ ine where m any of the anim als were e xposed to the toxin, par ticularly the loons and 
diving ducks that died in late fa ll.  To date, there have been pr actically no observations of sick 
loons or ducks; they almost invariab ly have wa shed ashore d ead.  Because winds m ay transpo rt 
 37 
  38 
 floating carcasses great distances, and because th ere are few people normally out on the lake at 
that time of year, the mystery remains. 
 
 
 Since type E’s appearance in New Yo rk in 1999, staff of the Department of 
Environmental Conservation’s (D EC) Division of Fish, Wildlife and Marine Resources have 
documented the extent of mortality, tried to unde rstand toxin pathways in the ecosystem, and 
made recommendations about human health con cerns and potential remedies.  Lake Erie 
Fisheries Unit staff have observed fish morbidity and mortality, collected dead fish and birds, 
and collected sediment, mussels and h ealthy fish for studies on diet and Clostridium  growth.  
Staff from DEC’s Buffalo office and the Wildlife Pathology Unit (WPU) in Delmar have 
systematically monitored many beaches, bays and ha rbors for dead fish and birds.  All of the 
birds and some of the fish are transporte d to the WPU’s laborat ory where post-mortem 
examinations are completed.  Such examinati ons include selection of samples for botulism 
testing, observations of ingested food items, and the identification of other causes of death.  This 
work has confirmed the suspected importan ce of the round goby in the toxin pathway and 
identified mudpuppies as a proba ble toxin victim and vector. Botulism in Humans

Definition: 
Botulism  is a syndrom e induced by poisoning through proteins produced by the bacterium  • 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
•       Clostridium botulinum. 
These proteins produce a paralysis of the m uscles and death by respiratory insufficiency. 
Clostridium botulinum  is but one strain of  the bacterial genus Clostrid ium. According to  
Bergey’s Manual of Systemic Bacteriology  the genus includes 83 strains of which 30 are 
pathologic in hum ans. 
 
Clostridium  (From: Gorbach Bartlett Blacklow) :       
Some common pathologic strains of the Clostridium  species and their associated condition 
include : 
¾ Clostrid ium difficile  – diarrhea 
¾ Clostrid ium perfring es – gas gangrene 
¾ Clostrid ium tetan i – tetanus 
¾ Clostridium botulinum  – botulism  
Clostrid ium species are ubiquitous in nature, in both soil and water, and are generally  
innocuous to hum ans. 
They are resilient, form ing spores w hen gr owth conditions are m arginal and rem aining 
      viable in the environm ent for extended periods of tim e. 
Clostridium botulinum  spores are ubiquitous in soils and aquatic sedim ents. 
They are activated under conditions of low oxygen tension and pH >4.6 
Under these and further conditions, th e bacteria m ay produce clinical  
disease in an imals or hum ans. 
Typically gr am-positive (in late tissu e recove ry, m ay  
appear g ram-negative).  
The m icroscopic appearance is th at of fat, boxcar-shaped rods. 
   
The bacteria m ay be subsetted on th e basis of other characteristics  
  such as biochem istry, m etabolism or other features.     From: Gorbach Bartlett Blacklow  
Clostrid ium species are p rimarily anaerobic. 
Some Clostridium species are quite “aer otolerant, ” such as: 
¾ Clostrid ium perfring es 
¾ Clostrid ium septicum  
¾ Clostrid ium histolyticum 
¾ Clostrid ium tertium 
Some Clostridium species lack certain enzym es. 
Spore form ation and aquatic toxin production m ay vary. 
Similarly, the strains them selves m ay be subsetted. 
 
 
 
 
 39Groupings & Epidemiology   (From: Gorbach Bartlett Blacklow) :     
  
 
Clostrid ia botulinum: 
Has seven types:  A, B, C, D, E, F, G         • 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• And two subtypes: C 1 & C 2 
Based on differences in th e serology of the toxins. 
Historically, as outbreaks of botulism would occur,  the inve stiga tions le d to the discovery of  
different types of toxins  associated w ith th e botulinum  bacteria. 
Outbreaks in cattle, ch ickens and oth er anim als revealed v ariances in the toxic p rotein s, and 
subsetting was based on these diffe rences for source identification. 
The common characteris tic of thes e strains is the ability to produce a potent neurotoxin. 
The likely p urpose of th e toxin is no t necess arily the death of the host, bu t instead, res istance 
agains t the h ost defense m echanism s. 
The toxin is so effective agains t the h ost and its d efensives th at: 
¾ the lethal hum an dose is 100 billionths of a gram (Science Ne ws) 
¾ without intervention, the host di es 70 percent of the tim e. 
Its spe cific a ntitoxin neutralizes the biologic a ctivity of each of the seven ty pes of botulinum  
bacteria toxin. 
There is no cross-neutralization to rely upon (limited reciprocal E&F). 
Type C is unique: 
¾ Antitoxin from  the Bengtson botulism strain  (isolated from  a chicken outbreak) 
neutralized toxin from  the Seddon strain (c attle outbreak), but not the reverse. 
 C 1 and C 2 subtypes were established to  distinguish the subsets. 
¾ Subtype C 1 produces tw o toxins, with C 2 producing only one of the two. 
Further blurring the subtyping: ty pe C organism s may also produ ce som e type D toxin, and  
type D m ay produce som e C2 toxin. 
Type C and D neurotoxins are phage m ediated; G is likely plasm id; and A, B, E, F ar e 
assumed chromosomal. 
Avian botulism  and botulism  in domesticated/w ild m ammals are freque ntly types C and D. 
Clostrid ia botulinum  may also be classified physiologi cally into four groups based on 
metabolism : 
¾ Group 1 - proteolytic organism s – all type A toxin producers, som e type B, E or F 
¾ Group 2 - nonproteolytic organism s – all type C and D toxin producers 
¾ Group 3 - mixed proteolysis characteristics 
¾ Group 4 - unique argentine type G toxin 
These groupings m ay be of som e importance. 
Each of the four groups is clearly DNA distinguishable. 
Some non-neurotoxigenic organism s are genetically rela ted to the groups: 
¾ Clostridium sporogenes  matches Group 1 
¾ Clostrid ium novyi  matches Group 3 
Thus, there are toxigenic and nontoxigenic m embers of the sam e “species.” See Table 233-1.

Human Botulism  (From: Gorbach Bartlett Blacklow) :      
Restricted to toxin types A, B, and E. • 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• There is evidence for ty pe F, in five instan ces (Center for Disease Control ) 
One food outbreak in France was type C, but onl y on the basis of recovery of the organism  
from the foo d: 
¾ No toxin was found in the food 
¾ No clinic al samples were taken 
One outbreak in Chad was type D based on recovered type D toxin in salted ham . 
Hauschild’s worldwide review of food-borne botulism  (1950 – 1988, 1989 pu blication date ) 
revealed 1015 cases:  
¾ Type A – 391 
¾ Type B – 170 
¾ Type E – 150 
¾ Type F – 4 
¾ Unknown – 300  
Type E food-borne botu lism is common in Alas ka, associated with fish an d trad itional food 
preparation s.  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• In the lower 48 states, type A predom inates in the west, typ e B in the ea st. 
 
Summary of Clostridium Botulinum: 
Type A, B, and E are of prim ary clin ical concern.  
Type C, D, and F are of ques tionable clinical sign ificance. 
Avian botulism  outbreaks are m ore associated with types C or D. 
Clinically important type E botulis m is related to fish consumption. 
 
 41Pathogenesis of Clostridium  (From: Gorbach Bartlett Blacklow) :     
 
Clostrid ium species produce a binary A-B toxin • 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• ¾ The A and B subunits are released separately from the bacteria and com bine to 
specific receptors on nerve cell surfaces. 
¾ Synergistically th e subu nits pen etrate the cell an d poison the acety lcholine 
transm itter release syste m. 
¾ Muscles receive no neu ral stim ulatio n and go flaccid. 
The toxins are dichain peptide m olecule s, molecular weight approxim ately 150 kd. 
A recent 3 -D study revealed a belt o f amino acids th at protect the lethal elem ents of the toxin, 
changing the structural percep tions of the toxins and thei r precise m echanism  of action . 
(Science Ne ws) 
Botulism  prim arily attacks the nerves to the sk eletal m uscles, although the neurotoxin m ay  
interfere with som e autono mic and even cardiac function. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Food-borne botulism  toxin is absorbed through th e intestine and transf erred to neurogenic  
recep tor sites via th e circulation system. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At the nerv e ending, a p ortion of the toxin bind s to the recep tor and a portion is in serted into 
the cell to p oison acetylcholine releas e, resu lting in flaccid paralys is. 
 42 
Clinical Syndrome and Treatment  (From: Gorbach Bartlett Blacklow) :    
Signs and symptom s may vary as a f unction of : • 
• 
• ¾ toxin type 
¾ dose 
¾ host param eters 
 
Onset of symptom  presentation m ay range fr om 18 to 36 hours, with outliers from   
six hours to ten days (Center for Dise ase Control) 
 
Typical sym ptoms include (see Table 233-3): 
¾ blurred vision 
¾ dysphagia 
¾ generalized weakness 
¾ nausea/vom iting 
¾ vertigo 
¾ abdom inal cram ps 
¾ paresthesias (sensation of prickling, tingling or creepi ng in the skin) in only  
 1 percent 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 43 
Typical signs include: • 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• ¾ respirato ry impairm ent 
¾ specific m uscle weakness or paralysis 
¾ eye m ovement im pairm ent 
¾ dry m outh, throat, or tongue 
¾ dilated, fixed pupils 
¾ ataxia 
¾ postural hypotension 
Diagnosis is m ade on the basis of signs and sy mptom s, with a degree of  clinical suspicion. 
The differential m ay be difficult and si milar presentations m ay be seen in: 
¾ Guilla in-Bar re 
¾ myasthenia gravis 
¾ stroke 
¾ chem ical poisoning 
Confir mation requires detection of the toxin, whether by serum  or st ool via m ouse bioassay 
(48-hour results vs. five-sev en day incubation results). 
State Health Departm ents or the Center fo r Diseas e Control will arrange for antitoxin. 
Antitoxin simply binds the circulating toxi n, it does not reverse the paralysis. 
The destru ction of  the ne urotran smitter is irr eversible. 
Trivalent an titoxin (for types A, B, E) is av ailable for non-infants (infan tile hum an antitoxin 
is different). 
Hum an trials have shown efficacy, although anim al studies reveal that unless the antitoxin is 
given early it is ineffective. 
Pentavalent botulism  toxoid (A, B, C, D, E) is available from  the Center for Disease C ontrol 
for research ers. 
Antibiotics are ill adv ised, as the death of the bacterium  may release m ore toxin.

Survival has im proved, due to the supportive care now available, i.e. m echanical ventilation. 
Fatality r ate (Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine) :  
¾ 1910 – 70 percent 
¾ 1980 – 12 percent 
¾ 1993 – 2 percent 
There are form s of botulism  poisoning other than food-borne infections: 
¾ Wound 
¾ Infantile  
WRT wound botulism  is exceed ingly rare ( Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine) , including 47 cases 
in the United States from 1943 to 1990. 
Wound botulism  requires special con ditions, e .g. unattend ed tissue necros is, etc. – and  
tetanus is far m ore of a clinical concern. 
If staff is concerned with bird car cass handling, vaccinati on could be used.  
 
 
 
 
 44Botulism in Humans - Interrela tionship with Avian Botulism: 
 
Possible He alth Concer ns: 
 
Avian botulism  may i mpact hum an health in two ways: • 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• ¾ The infected  specim ens m ay pose a direct health  hazard, dep ending on is sues such 
as botulism  type. 
¾ The occurrence m ay serve as a m arker for an env ironm ental factor of con cern, 
e.g. associated fish contam ination and fish consumption. 
Little concern for direct c onsum ption of infected gulls: 
¾ Not a sought after dish 
¾ Subtypes C and D typical to avian botu lism not generally linked to hum an 
disease, but there are ques tions…where did the gulls en counter their exposure and 
would other consum ables be affected?  
What is the botulism  type?  
Perhaps concern for food chain contam ination is involved w hen a predator or scavenger fish 
consum es the gull carcass. 
Little concern for direct inoc ulation from  carcass handling: 
¾ Wound botulism  exceedingly rare 
¾ Avian type C and D botulism  are of  question able clin ical con cern 
Still, collection and handling precautions are prud ent, particu larly when th e botulism  type is 
unknown. 
May be prudent for researchers to consider the pentavalent vaccine. 
Certainly seem s prudent from  a public health  perspective to res earch the phenom ena to: 
¾ eliminate th e dire ct sou rce conta ct potential 
¾ ensure safety of the food chain - p articularly fish  
 
The Fish Problem:  
 
Lake Erie is an angler’s pa radise and fish consumption is  widespread and essentially  
year-round. 
Fish preparation varies widely and le nds itself to potential botulism  issues. 
Lake Erie fish are sm oked, dried, sa lted – sm all fish are flash cooked. 
 
Botulism O utbreaks Oc cur With Fish Consumption: 
 
• Has been demonstrated in: 
¾ tuna fish, lobster, whitefish and other varieties 
¾ canned, sm oked, salted and dried preparations 
¾ Alaskan outbreaks m ost frequent 
¾ New York City, Novem ber 1987, eight cases  due to uneviscerated, dry-salted,  
 air-dried, whole, whitefish  -  botulinum  type E (Food and Dr ug Administr ation)  
Anglers m ay have unrecognized exposure  if the phenom enon is not studied. 
 
 
 
 45Clostrid ia botulinum  is a Resistant Organism : 
 
Spores survive for hours in boiling wa ter – pressure processing required (E L Andress).  • 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• Toxin m ay be destroyed by boiling f or 10 m inutes at sea level (+ 1 m in/1000 ft above) 
  (S. S. Sumne r). 
The vegetative cells are heat sens itive. 
Bacteria are inactive in acidic m edium  (pH < 4.6), but fish are not acidic: 
¾ As a result, usual fish prep aration may kill vegetative botulinum  bacter ia, but will 
not address existing ne urotoxins or spores. 
¾ If processed for storage (sm oked, dried, salted) risk is increased. 
Therefore, avian botulism in Lake Erie app ears an im portant m atter for study in term s of 
public health and safety. 
First, the ba cterial type is im portant to determ ine: 
¾ A, B, E are bad ones 
¾ C, D and F a re of som e question 
¾ G is not known to pose a risk 
Second, does the type vary – shoul d track for level of certainty?  
Third, is there public exposure?  
¾ Direct – probably not of too m uch concern – the bacterium  is ubiquitous 
¾ Indirect 
Either way, the knowledge gained by the investigations will have an im portant im pact on the 
public : 
¾ Either to dissuade fears 
¾ Or to guide for safer enjoym ent of Lake Erie 
 
Botulism in Humans – Conclusions: 
 
Botulism  poisoning is rare. 
Botulism  poisoning is deadly, but if discove red in tim e is no lo nger high ly fatal. 
Only certain types of botulism  seem  to effect  humans, but there rem ain questions in this 
 regard. 
Avian Botulism  in Lake Erie m ay have a hum an health im pact, and warrants future study of: 
¾ types 
¾ fish  
¾ food chain issues, other than fish 
Avian botulism  in Lake Erie m ay be st udied in relative safety given the: 
¾ likely bacter ial types 
¾ availability of pentavalent vaccine  
¾ medical treatm ents for the diseas e 
Avian botulism  in Lake Erie shou ld not be i gnored because o f the potential health ris ks it 
may entail: 
¾ Particularly, if any, for fisherm an 
¾ Possible bu t low like lihood for the public 
¾ The certain health risk f or the b irds 
¾ Possible association with fish kills

A Project to Study the Prevalence of Botulism in Fish in the Low er  
Great Lakes 
 
Principal Investigator:   Dr. Paul Bowser  
Co-Principal Investigator:   Dr. Rod Getchell 
Affiliation:  Dept. of Microbiology and Im munology,  
College of Veterinary Medicine,  
Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 
 
 
OBJECTIVE:  
 
 This project will focus on the role of fish in the recent docum ented outbreaks of botulism  
in waterfowl and the suspect botulism  in fish in the Lower Great Lakes.  The specific objectives 
of the project will be to determ ine the prevalence of  Clostridium botulinum  in apparently 
healthy, m oribund, and dead fish in areas of confirm ed outbreaks of avian botulism  and 
unaffected areas within the Lower Great Lake s.  W e will also quantify the am ount of C. 
botulinum  and toxin in carrier fish. 
 
 Four questions will be addressed in this work: 
(A) Is C. botulinum  more likely to be present in the intestinal tract or tissues of healthy,  
moribund, or dead fish?  
 (B)  Is one species of fish m ore likely to carry C. botulinum  than another?  
 (C)  Does C. botulinum  toxin form  in these fish ante- or post-m ortem? 
 (D)  Are fish carrying C. botulinum  associated with waterf owl m ortality events? 
 
RESEARCH PLAN:    
 
 Prevalence studies:   In a cooperative effort with the NYSDEC, we will collect fish from  
both Lake Erie and Lake Ontario.  The focus will be on the collection of carp and round gobies, 
as they have been the m ost com monly ef fected f ish species.  Other species of  fish will be 
exam ined on a case-by-case basis.  Standard necropsies will be perf ormed on all f ish sam pled.  
This will be done to assess the cause of any m ortalities as well as assess what other pathogens 
are present in these populations.  In addition, fish will be tested with a PCR test for C. botulinum.  
This is a sensitive test that is less expensive and tim e-consum ing than the m ouse bioassay.   
 
 The research ef fort will include scheduled collections of  fish as well as sam pling during 
active outbreaks of botulism  in waterfowl.  Appa rently healthy, m oribund, and recently dead fish 
will be collected.  Collection sites will include those locations where docum ented or suspect 
outbreaks of botulism  have occurred on Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. 
 
 PCR diagnostics:   A PCR technique to identify specific C. botulinum  genes has been 
developed by several research team s.  The presence of the gene is an indication of the presence 
of the C. botulinum  bacterium .  Our f ocus will be on the gene f or toxin type E, which is the m ost 
common botulism  toxin found in fish and the toxi n identified in the waterfowl m ortalities in 
2000.  The presence of C. botulinum , as indicated by the PCR test f or type E toxin gene will be 
determ ined from  fish intestine sam ples as well as selected organs such as liver.  In those sam ples 
 51that test positive, we will perf orm quantitative real-tim e PCR to enum erate the num ber of  
bacteria present. 
 
 C. botulinum  toxin analysis:   For those f ish sam ples that are PCR-positive, we will ship 
frozen sub-sam ples of intestinal contents to the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at the 
University of Pennsylvania' s New Bolton Center to test for pre-form ed botulinum  toxin type E 
by the m ouse bioassay m ethod. 
 
BACKGROUND: 
 
Botulism  was docum ented in waterf owl during several m ass mortality events on Lake 
Erie in 1999, 2000, and 2001.  Concurrent or preceding these outbreaks were m ortalities in fish 
species such as carp, alewives, gizzard shad, drum , stonecat, and round gobies.  One 
unconfirm ed theory as to why the fish were dying was that storm -induced turnover of the lake 
may have brought up cold, less-oxygenated water that precipitated the fish kills, but no definitive 
diagnoses have been reached.  Tem perature intolerance is known to kill gizzard shad.  
Historically low water levels and algal bloom s of Microcystis  and Cladophora  were also 
suggested as possible causes of anoxia and subsequent fish kills.  Type E C. botulinum  toxin 
developing in dead, rotting fish is well docum ented, but species of waterfowl that were dying in 
these outbreaks, such as com mon loons and m ergansers, are not known to feed on dead fish.  
They feed m ainly on live fish raising the question about whether live fish m ay carry the deadly 
toxin. 
 
 The Canadian Cooperative W ildlife Health Centre has an excellent discussion of this 
issue on their website: <http://wildlife.usask.ca/bookhtm l/botulism /botulism e.htm>.   
The following three paragraphs are from  this site entitled, "Ecology of Type E Botulism  in 
Canadian W ild Birds." 
 
 Very little is known about the ecology of Type E botulism .  It is known that the 
spores of Clostridium botulinum  Type E are abundant in the water of m any Canadian 
lakes and that the spores also can readily be found in the gills and digestive tracts of fish 
from  such lakes.  These spores, them selves, are harm less.  Type E botulism  occurs only 
under conditions when these spores grow and produce toxin.  The ecological role of the 
bacterium  appears to be that of a decom poser - a bacterium  of putrefaction.  The 
bacterium  will grow only in a rich nutrient substrate that is free of oxygen.  Fish that die 
for any reason and that contain the bacterial spores in their tissues are suitable substrate 
for growth and toxin production by the bacterium . 
 It seem s clear that the fish-eating wild birds that have died of Type E botulism  
have becom e poisoned from  eating fish that c ontain the toxin.  It is not clear exactly how 
this happens.  Birds such as loons and m ergansers norm ally capture and eat only live fish.  
Yet, C. botulinum  Type E should not grow and produce toxin in living fish.  It m ay be 
that there are circum stances under which toxin is produced in the tissues of live, possibly 
dying, fish, possibly within their digestive tracts.  Alternatively, it m ay be that the fish 
captured alive and eaten by the birds had them selves fed on som e source of Type E toxin.  
Thus, it would be the toxin in the digestive tracts of the live fish that was the source of 
toxin for the birds in these outbreaks.  It is even possible that the live fish captured by the 
birds were partially paralysed by the Type E toxin they had recently eaten and thus were 
 52 53particularly easy prey for the birds. This might account for preferential feeding on toxin-
containing fish by the affected birds. 
 It seems likely that there are outbreaks of Type E Botulism only when a variety of particular ecological factors occur simultaneous ly.  There must be toxin produced in food 
material eaten by fish, and those fish must then be eaten by birds.  The two outbreaks in Canada and the United States occurred in the fall when fish-eating birds congregate in favourable feeding habitat during fall migration. 
 
 Obviously, there are a number of questions about the ecology of type E botulism and what the causal factors are that lead to outbreaks of type E botulism.  More specifically, until we understand the circumstances under which fish-eating birds can become intoxicated from eating live or moribund fish we will not be able to mitigate or prevent outbreaks of type E botulism in wild birds.

Group 2 – Education and Outreach Group  
 
In regards to Dr. Lyons’ presentation: 
• More inform ation is needed on proper way to cook fish. 
• Risk levels – range of toxin?  
• Smoking fish by individuals - proper way, especia lly if found in m ore popular fish species. 
• Consistent guidelines on fish consumption. 
• Health warnings – how long before wear off after botulism  outbreak? 
• Need to evaluate risk vs. cost to industry. 
 
Standard inform ation – is it possible?  
• Preparing fish – so m any different ways used. 
• Experim entation is needed to develop dosage. 
• Risk with not properly handled fi sh has always been a problem. 
• Level needed for fish botulism  – experim ent study needed. 
 
• Important to know – can fish be m ade sick by botulism , or are they the carrier? 
• Are sym ptoms of all sick fish botulism ? 
• More testing needs to be done , especially on sheepshead. 
• Need to get word out not to c ook sick looking fish and birds. 
• 1/100 billion of dose – does it have an eff ect on public water system s or swimming? 
• Pooling of bacterial levels – needs to  be defined if this is possible. 
• Need for foc us – study what are the risks?  
 55 56• Sample Cladophora for botulism. 
 
• Great Lakes Fishery Commission lo oking for projects on botulism. 
• Agencies need to know what others  are doing – more networking needed. 
• How do we create a network? 
 What are other states doing? 
• What is going on in the lake – is something promoting it? 
• Lake Levels – predictive? 
• Lady bugs – any impact on system changing? 
 
Important issues: 
• What dosage produces human risk? 
• Standardize message to public: 
 - Level of dosage in fish? 
 - What are the risks in improper cooking? 
• Symptoms of botulism in humans needs to be defined:   
 - Will education make the public look for it? 
 - Send information to doctors making them aware of botulism. 
 - What type of botulism are we dealing with? 
- Type E in Lake Erie - Does the public need to be concerned about type?

• Very nice overviews – good di versity in presentations. 
• Very inf ormative.

6.) Would you be interested in attending a follo w-up workshop on this topic in the future? 
 
Yes 84 No 0    Uncertain  4 
Comments: 
• Perhaps next year. 
• But focus on accomplishments regarding research issues. 
• Absolutely. 
• Needs to be at least periodically re-visited unless “fixed.” 
• Would like to hear more about health and public policy needs. 
• How can citizens help? 
• Absolutely! 
 
7.) Please provide any additional suggestions or topic areas that may prove beneficial to 
 organizers and researchers involved with this project? 
• Perhaps fewer presentations and more time allo cated to developing approaches to address 
 specific questions.  We know there is a problem (dead birds, fish).  What should we do 
 now?  Focus on experimental design to get to the cause.  Thanks so much for organizing 
 such an informative workshop! 
• Issues related to recreati onal opportunities and critter disposal.  Is it safe to swim/wade etc. in 
 areas with large quantities of fish carcasses?  What are impacts to recreational 
 opportunities like swimming, fishing, etc.? 
• Bob Beltran, USEPA Region 5 GLNPO, has wo rking hypothesis on whole picture, check 
 with him. 
• Not enough breakout time. 
• With resources of course.  I am able to include  information to coastal and river residents and 
 shoreline anglers. 
• Maybe more information on analytic al aspects.  Modeling efforts? 
• This workshop has obviously been valuable and productive in focusing research and 
 awareness on Type E botulism.  Sea Grant truly did an outstanding job with this! 
• Thank you. 
• Perhaps make the proceedings available on a CD.
