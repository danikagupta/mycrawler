ABSTRACT  
 
 
 
In this study, decolorization of Orange II dye using  Enterococcus faecalis 
immobilized onto multi -walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) cement composite was 
assessed . Multi -walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) cement composites were made 
by mixing   zeolite  (40g), cement  (12g), water  (8ml) and MWCNT  (0.6g) for 
attachment of biofilm. Biofilm was allowed  to develop on the biocomposites for 7 
days.  The efficiency of decolorization of orange II dye was examined in the presence 
and absence of biofilm.  By comparing the system with and without biofilm, the 
system with out biofilm (using free suspended cells)  achieved the highest percentage 
removal of orange II dye (97.69%). Unexpectedly t he lowest percentage of dye 
decolorization  was achieved for the system using cells immobilized onto Hardened 
Cement Paste  + MWCNT  (72.74 %). This was most likely due to the cytot oxic effect 
of MWCNT on the bacterial cells.  As expected maximum  decolor ization for all the 
systems occurred in anaerobic condition and after entering the aerobic condition 
decolorization had  reached  a steady state because of the competition between oxygen  
and dye.

 Dalam kajian ini, peny ahwarnaan  pewarna  Orange II  menggunakan 
Enterococcus faecalis  yang disekat gerak  pada  tiub nano karbon berdinding  ganda  
(MWCNT ) simen komposit telah dikaji . MWCNT   simen komposit telah dibuat 
dengan mencampurkan  zeolit  (40 g), simen (12  g), air (8  mL) dan MWCNT (0.6  g). 
Lapisan b iofilem telah  dibangunkan pada komposit  selama 7 hari. Kecekapan 
peny ahwarnaan  pewarna Orange II  telah di kaji dalam kehadiran dan ketiadaan 
biofi lem. Kajian mendapati bahawa  sistem tanpa biofi lem (menggunakan sel bebas ) 
mencapai peratusan penyingkiran tertinggi pewarna Orange II  (97,69%)  
manakala peratusan terendah telah dicapai untuk sistem menggunakan sel -sel yang 
telah disekat gerak dan membentuk biofilem  pada MWCNT  simen komposit  
(72,74%). Pencapaian peratusan penyahwarnaan yang rendah ini   mungkin 
disebabkan oleh kesan sitotoksik MWCNT  pada sel -sel bakteria. Sebagaimana yang 
dijangka proses penyahwarnaan maksimum  telah dicapai  dalam keadaan anaerobik . 
Walaubagaimanpu n proses ini telah mencapai keadaan mantap  dalam keadaan 
aerobik akibat persaingan antara oksigen dan pewarna.

CHAPTER 1  
INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Introduction  
Textile wastewater as one of the industrial wastes always draws attention of 
researchers and scientists. Textile industries are described by high water and 
chemical consumption as a result of different processes which give rise to noticeable 
amounts of colored wastewater. Their conventional treatment like the other waste has 
some steps and is mostly physico -chemical and biological. Textile comp anies may 
face a lack of available water sources due to water insufficiency and restrictions of 
ground water use. In the near future, many textile companies will have to improve 
wastewater quality to the fresh water standards for reuse purpose.  
Tendency to  use biological methods has increased in recent years, because of 
their ability for removing the organic materials and the problems that chemicals 
cause to nature. Furthermore for using microorganisms which can degrade these 
waste, some methods have been s uggested but most of them are time consuming, 
expensive and low efficient versus chemicals.  
Dyes are the visual part of textile wastewater and because of that take most 
attention at first glance and the usual methods are not efficient in decolorizing them  
and it seems that microorganisms are more important in this part. Types of the dyes 2 
 
according to their application and chemical composition are diverse and due that we 
need to use different kind of microorganisms.  
Because of that, biological methods shou ld be consist either of one species of 
special microorganisms or of various kinds of different microorganisms that can 
establish an ecosystem suitable for dye omitting. At the end dyes can be degraded 
into simpler compounds and are finally mineralized to w ater and carbon dioxide by a 
wide variety of aerobic or anaerobic organisms.  
Microorganisms need time, stability and physical support to work efficiently 
on wastes from effluent and for this matter one of the method is immobilizing 
enzyme or cell to great ly restrict the freedom of movement of them. So 
immobilization provides a physical support for cells. Therefore the first consideration 
is to decide on the support material and then the main method of immobilization.  
Lately the use of nanomaterials in bio -related research has  increased sharply. 
Nanomaterials due to their dimension have specific characteristics which make them 
valuable and provide  new ideas for novel research.  
1.2 Background of Study  
No ideal support material or method of immobilization ha s emerged to 
provide a standard for each type of immobilization. Selection of support material and 
method of immobilization is made by measuring the various attributes of the enzyme 
or cell application against the properties and limitations of the combined  
immobilization and support. Several practical aspects should be considered before 
starting laboratory work to ensure that the final immobilized enzyme or cell 
preparation is suitable for the planned purpose or application and will operate at 
optimum effec tiveness.  3 
 
Different methods of immobilization can influence the activity and half -life 
of a cell -based biotransformation. There are five principal methods for 
immobilization of enzymes or cells: adsorption, covalent binding, entrapment, 
encapsulation, and cross -linking.  
There are many different support materials such as calcium alginate, 
polyacrylamide, DEAE -cellulose, glutaraldehyde and agar. Moreover in some 
research solid and porous materials like sponge have been used. Recently by the 
emerging and development of nanotechnology, the interest of using them in 
environmental research regarding to their unique properties has increased.  
Azo dyes are the most important groups of synthetic dyes. It had been 
estimated that about 10% of the dye stuff used dur ing the dyeing processes does not 
bind to the fibers and is released into the effluents. Because all the industrially 
produced azo dyes are xenobiotic compounds, it is not surprising that they are 
recalcitrant in conventional treatment methods (Steffan et al., 2005).  
1.3 Objectives  of the Study  
 To immobilize dye degrading bacterial cells onto hardened cement paste with 
multi-walled carbon nanotube s (MWCNT) . 
 To compare the ability of freely suspended and immobilized hardened cement 
paste with MWCNT to degrad e Orange II dye.  4 
 
1.4 Scope of the Study  
The study was concentrated on the decolorization of pure dye solution of 
Orange II. Composite of zeolite , cement and MWCNT were used to immobilize 
bacterial cells ( Enterococcus faecalis ) which are able to degrade Ora nge II. Dye 
decolorization, pH, optical density ( OD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were 
determined and analyzed by standard methods.
