Only within the past decade has the potential of metal biosorption by biomass materials 
been well established. For economic reasons, of particular interest are abundant 
biomass types generated as a waste byproduct of large-scale industrial fermentations 
or certain metal-binding algae found in large quantities in the sea. These biomass 
types serve as a basis for newly developed metal biosorption processes foreseen 
particularly as a very competitive means for the detoxification of metal-bearing 
industrial effluents. The assessment of the metal-binding capacity of some new 
biosorbents is discussed. Lead and cadmium, for instance, have been effectively 
removed from very dilute solutions by the dried biomass of some ubiquitous species 
of brown marine algae such as Ascophyllum and Sargassum, which accumulate more 
than 30% of biomass dry weight in the metal. Mycelia of the industrial steroid- 
transforming fungi Rhizopus and Absidia are excellent biosorbents for lead, cadmium, 
copper, zinc, and uranium and also bind other heavy metals up to 25% of the biomass 
dry weight. Biosorption isotherm curves, derived from equilibrium batch sorption 
experiments, are used in the evaluation of metal uptake by different biosorbents. 
Further studies are focusing on the assessment of biosorbent performance in dynamic 
continuous-flow sorption systems. In the course of this work, new methodologies are 
being developed that are aimed at mathematical modeling of biosorption systems and 
their effective optimization. Elucidation of mechanisms active in metal biosorption 
is essential for successful exploitation of the phenomenon and for regeneration of 
biosorbent materials in multiple reuse cycles. The complex nature of biosorbent 
materials makes this task particularly challenging. Discussion focuses on the 
composition of marine algae polysaccharide structures, which seem instrumental in 
metal uptake and binding. The state of the art in the field of biosorption is reviewed 
in this article, with many references to recent reviews and key individual contributions.

247 Introduction 
Metallic species mobilized and released into the envi- 
ronment by the technological activities of humans tend 
to persist indefinitely, circulating and eventually ac- 
cumulating throughout the food chain, thus posing a 
serious threat to the environment, animals, and humans. 
It is essential to realize that the metal is only “removed” 
from solution when it is appropriately immobilized. The 
procedure of metal removal from aqueous solutions often 
leads to effective metal concentration. Apart from the 
rather slow natural process of metal mineralization, the 
ultimate removal is attained only when the metal be- 
comes concentrated to the point that it can be either 
returned to the process or resold. This aspect of the 
operation deals with the potential recovery of the metal, 
which ideally should go hand in hand with the removal 
aspect, making the overall process an ultimately effective 
procedure for controlling the utilization of metals by 
humans in their technological processes. 
Apart from dispersed sources of dissolved and/or 
leached metals, large proportions of heavy metal species 
are released into the enviroment from industrial waste- 
waters through inefficiencies built into the technological 
activities used directly in the processing of metals or

Bohumil Volesky is a Professor of Chemical Engineering 
at McGill University (Montreal, Canada), active in areas of 
biochemical engineering and industrial water pollution 
control. He obtained his basic training at the Czech Techni- 
cal University in Prague, Czech Republic, receiving the Dipl. 
Ing. degree in 1962. Following more than 4 years of 
industrial research and experience, he earned his Ph.D. in 
biochemical engineering at the University of Western On- 
tario (London, Ontario) in 1971. He is the founder and a 
president of BV Sorbex, Inc., a new technology venture 
commercializing the biosorption process for removal and 
recovery of heav metals from industrial solutions that he 
has been pioneering in his research. He has held appoint- 
ments as a visiting professor at the Swiss Federal Institute 
of Technology (Lausanne, Switzerland) and at the University 
of Puerto Rico, and his major collaborative research activities 
include colleagues in China, Brazil, Korea, and the Czech 
Republic. His current research interests are reflected in a 
recently published book Biosorption of Heavy Metals that 
he edited and in a monograph volume Modeling and Opti- 
mization of Fermentation Processes.

Zdenek Richard Holan recently concluded a 3-year stint 
as a research associate in Professor Volesky’s research 
laboratory at McGill University (Montreal, Canada). Prior 
to 1989, he was a senior research at the Microbiological 
Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences (Prague, Czech 
Republic), where he specialized in microbial cell wall polysac- 
charides and their biogenesis, structures, purification, and 
applications. His unique achievements in this field earned 
him the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences Prize in 1983. 
He received his basic Dipl. Ing. degree in agricultural 
chemistry from the Institute of Agriculture in Prague in 
1965. On several occassions he was a visiting scientist in 
Germany, Russia, Latvia, and the Pasteur Institute in 
France, always engaged in bio-polysaccharide research. 
through other routes. Virtually any industrial activity 
using metals has a metal disposal problem. In addition, 
there are numerous technology-related activities that 
result in the release of metallic species. Industrially 
based metal-bearing discharges can be considered as 
point-source emissions, which in turn offer the possibility 
of feasible process-based remedial actions. Sorption and/ 
or complexation of dissolved metals based on the chemical activity of microbial biomass, known as biosorption, 
provides the foundation for the new biosorption technol- 
ogy for metal removal and recovery, which offers promise 
as an alternative for potentially economically attractive 
treatment particularly suited for a wide variety of 
industrial metal-bearing point-source effluent discharges. 
Biosorbent Materials. The work of Adams and 
Holmes (1935) represented not only the threshold in ion- 
exchange chemistry but also an early attempt at biosorp- 
tion. They described the removal of Ca and Mg ions by 
tannin resin, black wattle bark (Acacia mollissima), 
which were treated directly so that the condensation 
product was fxed on the woody fibers (Adams and 
Holmes, 1935). The condensation product of m-phen- 
ylenediamine and formaldehyde was used for anion 
sorption. Strong biosorbent behavior of certain types of 
microbial toward metallic ions is a function of the 
chemical makeup of the microbial cells of which it 
consists. It is necessary to emphasize that this type of 
active biomass consists of dead and metabolically inactive 
cells. This aspect is particularly important when it comes 
to the process application, whereby new biosorbents 
represent “chemicals” capable of sequestering a relatively 
large amount of the metal (Volesky, 1990a,b). 
Some types of biosorbents could be broad range, 
binding and collecting the majority of heavy metals with 
no specific priority, while others can even be specific for 
certain types of metals (Hosea et al., 1986; Volesky and 
Kuyucak, 1988). Table 1 summarizes most of the more 
consistent attempts to identify metal-sorbing biomass 
types in the microbial world. The results of these studies 
vary widely because of the different criteria used by the 
authors in searching for suitable material. Some used 
easily available biomass types, others specially isolated 
strains, and some processed the raw biomass to a certain 
degree to improve its biosorption application properties. 
In the absence of uniform methodology, results have been 
reported in different units and in many different ways, 
often making quantitative comparison impossible. How- 
ever, a general conclusion can be drawn that there are 
potent biosorbent materials among easily available bio- 
mass types from all three groups: algae, fungi, and 
bacteria, the former two perhaps giving broader choices. 
The source of the raw materials for the new family of 
biosorbents conveniently is a waste material, as is the 
case in using byproduct biomass from large-scale fer- 
mentation processes. In particular, some waste mycelia 
available in large quantities indicate an interesting 
potential of these biomass types in the collection and 
removal of heavy metals (Nemec et al., 1977; Niu et al., 
1993; Paknikar et al., 1993). While some of this work 
has been reviewed recently (Siege1 et al., 1990; Volesky, 
1990a,b), fungi such as Mucor sp. (Mueler et al., 1992) 
and Rhizopus sp. (Fourest and Roux, 1992; Lewis and 
Kiff, 1988; Luef et al., 1991; Tsezos and Volesky, 1981; 
Volesky and Tsezos, 1981; Zhou and Kiff, 1991) continue 
to attract interest for their high metal uptake capacity. 
A different type of fungal biomass discarded from rubber 
plantations has also been of interest (Venkobachar, 1990). 
Application-oriented work on metal biosorption by waste 
bacterial biomass from Bacillus subtilis has not reached 
expectations in its application (Brierley, J. A., 1990; 
Brierley and Vance, 1988; Brierley et al., 1986). 
Another inexpensive source of biomass, where it is 
produced in copious quantities, is in the oceans as 
seaweeds, representing many different types of marine 
macroalgae (Kuyucak and Volesky, 1990). However, 
most of even the recent contributions studying the uptake 
of toxic metals by live marine and, to a lesser extent, 
freshwater algae focused on toxicological aspects, metal Biofechnol. Prog., 1995, Vol. 11, No. 3 237 
accumulation, and pollution indicators by living, meta- 
bolically active biomass. Focus on the technological 
aspects of metal removal by algal biomass has been rare 
(Bedell and Darnall, 1990; Darnall, 1991; Holan, et al., 
1993; Kuyucak and Volesky, 1990; Volesky and Kuyucak, 
1988). 
Abundant natural materials, particularly of cellulosic 
nature, have been suggested as potential biosorbents for 
heavy metals. However, little work has been done in that 
respect. While the properties of sawdust have been 
rather superficially tested in a few recent studies (Aval, 
1991; Bryant et al., 1992; Chan et al., 1992), modified 
cellulose has also been examined (Shukla and Sakhar- 
dande, 1992; Svoboda et al., 19921, as well as bark 
(Khangan et al., 1992; Shukla and Pandey, 1990) and 
modified starch (Wang et al., 1991; Zhang et al., 1990). 
The meaningful search for metal-sorbent biomaterials 
would be expedited greatly if the phenomenon of metal 
biosorption were better understood. That knowledge 
could serve as a guide in the search for potentially high- 
sorbing materials in the natural domain. However, with 
the state of the art being in its infancy as it is, tedious 
experimental screening of selected readily available types 
of biomass is still the basis for discovering new biosor- 
bents. Considering the number of candidate biomass 
types and the number of metals of interest, all multiplied 
by the number of variable experimental or process 
parameters, the scope of the task of prospecting for new 
and potentially feasible metal biosorbents is rather large. 
Biosorption of metals is not based on only one mech- 
anism. It consists of several mechanisms that quanti- 
tatively and qualitatively differ according to the species 
used, the origin of the biomass, and its processing. Metal 
sequestration follows complex mechanisms, mainly ion 
exchange, chelation, adsorption by physical forces; and 
ion entrapment in inter- and intrafibrillar capillaries and 
spaces of the structural polysaccharide network as a 
result of the concentration gradient and diffusion through 
cell walls and membranes. There are several chemical 
groups that could attract and sequester the metals in bio- 
mass: acetamido groups of chitin, structural polysaccha- 
rides of fungi, amino and phosphate groups in nucleic 
acids, amino, amido, sulfhydryl, and carboxyl groups in 
proteins, hydroxyls in polysaccharides, and mainly car- 
boxyls and sulfates in the polysaccharides of marine algae 
that belong to the divisions Phaeophyta, Rhodophyta, and 
Chlorophyta. However, it should be stressed that the 
presence of some functional group does not guarantee 
their accessibility for sorption, perhaps due to steric, 
conformational, or other barriers. 
Biosorption by Industrial Biomass Types. The 
bulk of earlier work on biosorption indicated that ura- 
nium is a metal particularly susceptible to biosorption 
uptake and probably most is known about this particular 
type of biosorption. Uranium uptakes exceeding 200 mg 
of U/g for Rhizopus arrhizus have been noted (Treen- 
Sears, 1981; Tsezos, 1980). Even Saccharomyces cereui- 
siae, which is an otherwise mediocre metal biosorbent, 
sequesters uranium in the largest quantities. Although 
nonliving yeast cells accumulated more uranium than 
live cells (Volesky et al., 19931, phosphatase enzyme 
activity has been associated with the slower but copious 
additional deposition of uranyl phosphate microcrystals 
observed in the phosphatase-overproducing strain of 
Citrobacter sp. (Macaskie and Dean, 1988). Good evi- 
dence now exists showing that the biomass of filamentous 
fungi of the order Mucorales represents a good biosorbent 
material for a wide range of heavy metals. The metal- 
binding sites are predominantly associated with the cell 
wall structure of these molds (Remacle, 1990). Both R. arrhizus and Rhizopus niqricans contain chitin and 
chitosan in their cell walls, which have been reported to 
play a role in the sequestration of uranyl ions from 
solution (Muzzarelli, 1972; Tsezos, 1980). Although 
chitin and chitosan have been reported to remove a 
number of metal ions from solution, among these are 
titanium, zirconium, hafnium, mercury, copper, and 
uranium (Muzzarelli, 19721, they do not seem to be the 
major metal-binding compounds active in the complex 
sequestration of metals by biosorption. 
Despite earlier optimistic reports on Pencillium bio- 
sorption (Jilek et al., 1975), the mycelium seems to be 
sorbing well only uranium and to a certain degree lead 
(Niu et al., 1993). Also, common types ofhpergillus have 
never performed very well. Lead seems to follow ura- 
nium in its propensity for being biosorbed. The fungal 
biomass of Absidia orchidis exhibited an excellent uptake 
of lead (Holan and Volesky, 1995). There are several 
reasons why this fungus, frequently used in transhy- 
droxylation reactions of methylpyridines (Skryabin and 
Koshcheenko, 1987) or steroids (Gai et al., 1981), could 
bind heavy metals: (1) The presence of ionic groups 
capable of sequestering metals. There is glucuronic acid 
in linear, (l+4)-linked @-D-glucuronans (Tsuchihashi et 
al., 1983) and phosphates as key constituents of the cell 
wall (Campos-Tahaki et al., 1983). (2) The presence of 
cis-oriented hydroxyl groups in a-D-mannans (Yamada 
et al., 1982) capable of forming chelate complexes with 
metals. (3) The presence of SH groups, which may be 
more abundant in steroid-transforming fungi with el- 
evated levels of cytochrome PGO, performing the trans- 
hydroxylation reactions. The formation of strong cova- 
lent bonds between lead and SH groups is well-known. 
(4) p-Toluenesulfonic acid is known to be used in the 
process of the microbial hydroxylation of steroids (Gai 
et al., 1981). When incorporated, it could enhance metal 
uptake. (5) Chitin and glucan belong to the main 
structural polysaccharides in fungi. The possibility of 
metal uptake by these compounds might be due to not 
only the acetamido groups of chitin but also the entrap- 
ment of metals in the inter- and intrafibrillar capilarities 
in both of these biopolymers. 
Species of Penicillium do not show such diversity. 
Structural polysaccharides consist mainly of glucan and 
chitin (Edwards and Ho, 1988; Grisaro et al., 1968) and 
of glycans containing glucose, galactose, mannose, and 
sometimes organic acids, e.g., malonic acid. Phosphate 
groups are also present in abundance as part of galac- 
tans, not only in cell walls but also in exocellular 
polysaccharides (Preston et al., 1969). According to the 
structural analysis, the cell wall D-glucuronans from A. 
orchidis resembled those of Rhizopus. The differences 
mentioned earlier could partially explain the differences 
in lead sorption by the two types of fungal biomass, but 
not the cadmium uptake, which was higher for the P. 
chrysogenum. In general, significant differences in the 
biosorbent mechanisms of metal deposition in different 
types of microbial biomass can easily be postulated 
(Volesky, 1990a,b) but remain to be studied. 
Biosorption by Seaweed Materials. Some sea- 
weeds collected from the ocean have indicated impressive 
biosorption of metals (Kuyucak and Volesky, 1990). 
Brown algae in particular are suited for binding metallic 
ions, probably due to their polysaccharide content (Per- 
cival and McDowell, 1967). According to some results 
(Crist et al., 1988), the biosorption of heavy metals has 
two phases: a fast (<4 s) surface reaction and much 
slower metal uptake (2 h). The first phase is attributed 
to surface adsorption, mainly based on anion exchange 
with the participation of the carboxyl groups of uronic 238

acids. The second phase represents the diffusion of ions 
into the cell structures. Crist et al. (1990) demonstrated 
that copper was adsorbed not only by ion exchange but 
also by additional covalent bonding with the carboxyl 
groups of Vuucheria pectins. Biosorbed copper was also 
found to be bound by chelation between the cis-oriented 
hydroxyls at C2 and C3 of yeast a-mannans, which 
formed an insoluble complex and helped in their isolation (Peat et al., 1961). It is possible that similar chelation 
could occur between the cis-oriented hydroxyls at C2 and 
C3 in the D-mannuronic and L-guluronic acids of algal 
polysaccharides. The ion exchange in algal biomass is 
not so simple. The chemical composition exhibits at least 
two groups capable of ion exchange: carboxyls of uronic 
acids and sulfates of carrageenans, xylans, and galactans. 
Although carboxyl groups have been identified as Biofechnol. frog., 1995, Vol. 11 No. 3 
of different metals, they could be divided into four major 
categories: (1) toxic heavy metals, (2) strategic metals, 
(3) precious metals, and (4) radionuclides. In terms of 
environmental threat, it is mainly categories 1 and 4 that 
are of interest for removal from the environment and/or 
the point-source effluent discharges. 
When considering the environmental impact of mobi- 
lized metals, the “big three”, mercury, lead, and cad- 
mium, are in the limelight (Volesky, 1990a,b). Less so 
is perhaps mercury, which is being displaced from 
industrial processes by the introduction of new technolo- 
gies, With relatively well-defined point sources of lead 
contamination, the major spread of lead in the environ- 
ment has been curbed by the introduction of unleaded 
gasoline. While the uses of mercury and lead are limited 
and do not mark an increasing trend, cadmium is toxic 
and ubiquitous in its distribution throughout the world. 
With the uses of cadmium on the rise, it represents a 
recognized great potential hazard to humans and the 
environment. 
Apart from toxicological criteria, the interest in specific 
metals may also be based on how representative their 
behavior may be in terms of the eventual generalization 
of results of studying their biosorbent uptake. The 
toxicity and intriguing solution chemistry of elements 
such as Cr, As, and Se make them interesting. A few 
more widely used metals, Ni and V among them, as well 
as common metals such as zinc and copper are worth 
studying. Zinc is an essential element for enzyme 
activators in humans, but it is also toxic at levels of 100- 
500 mglday. Copper is not toxic to the extent of zinc, 
but its extensive use and increasing levels in the envi- 
ronment are cause for concern. While hexavalent chro- 
mium is extremely toxic, it occurs as an anion with 
properties that are correspondingly different from those 
of the usual metal cations. However, it can easily be 
chemically, or even biochemically (Paknikar and Bhide, 
1993; Reischl et al., 1993), reduced to its trivalent 
state, making it more amenable to removal (Siege1 et al., 
1986). 
A special case is that of radioactive isotopes originating 
from both upstream and downstream operations of the 
nuclear industry, from the utilization of fission reaction 
fuel rods, and from military and reprocessing operations. 
Some of the radioisotopes present may require individual 
control procedures. The hazard level depends on the half- 
life of the isotope. Uranium mill tailings are a source of 
low-level radiation, 0.1-1.0 mWh. Radium-226 is very 
important because it is the most hazardous of all isotopes 
found in the tailings. Relatively little work has been done 
on the biosorption of radium (Tsezos and Matar, 1986) 
and thorium (Tsezos and Volesky, 1981). The uptake of 
strontium and several other radionuclides by microbial 
cells was noted mainly in toxicologically oriented studies 
conducted for different purposes. Among all the metals, 
there are numerous indications from previous work that 
uranium tends to be biosorbed exceptionally well (Ma- 
caskie and Dean, 1985,1988; Tsezos and Volesky, 1981; 
Volesky et al., 1983). This feature of the metal undoubt- 
edly is related to its large atomic weight and ionic radius 
(Tobin et al., 1984). However, naturally occurring ura- 
nium is not particularly a problem in the environment 
and interest in the element has subsided, resulting in a 
glut of uranium on the world markets. The early work 
done with uranium, and to a lesser extent with thorium 
(Tsezos and Volesky, 1981, 1982a,b), was driven by the 
interest shown in the metal by the nuclear industry, 
which is currently stagnant. 
Strategic and precious metals, while not necessarily 
posing environmental threats, are the prime targets for possibly the main metal-sequestering sites (Majidi et al., 
19901, they are not likely to be the only strongly active 
sites. It is interesting to note that, after the esterification 
of carboxyl groups in algal biomass, the sorption of copper 
dropped, but the binding of Au3+ increased (Gardea- 
Torresday et al., 1990). The biomass of Sargassum 
species offers excellent biosorbent properties, whereby 
even very selective and previously patented sequestering 
of gold is possible (Kuyucak and Volesky, 1989b,d,f; 
Volesky and Kuyucak, 1988). Ascophyllum, reported to 
bind effectively at least cobalt (Kuyucak and Volesky, 
1989a,c,e), cadmium (Holan, et al., 19931, and lead (Holm 
and Volesky, 1994), contains a unique mixture of polysac- 
charides offering a variety of active groups capable of 
effectively binding metallic ions. 
Alginates, mainly composed of (1-41-linked @+man- 
nopyranosyl uronate and its C5 epimer a-L-gulopyranosyl 
uronate, are members of a glucuronan family. Both 
uronic acids occur in varying ratios and differing quanti- 
ties in samples of polysaccharides taken from different 
algal species or strains. These parameters can also differ 
according to the age, season, and origin of the alga (Haug 
et al., 1974; Haug and Smidsord, 1965). 
A semispeculative model of the structure of the cell 
walls of brown algae has been proposed recently (Kloareg 
et al., 1986): cellulose chains form the rigid structural 
network in which four other biopolymers (alginates, 
xylofucoglucans, xylofucoglycuronans, and homofucans) 
are embedded. Similarities of the fucose-containing 
polysaccharides of the cell walls of several genera of 
brown algae, as well as the variations in the sugar 
constituents of algal polysaccharides, were also described 
(Mabeau et al., 1990; Nishida et al., 1990). Although the 
algal species ofA. nodosum and F. vesiculosus examined 
recently (Holan et al., 1993) for their metal-sequestering 
ability differ taxonomically, their biomass features two 
common moieties. (1) Sulfate esters in the cellular 
polysaccharides, including (a) fucoidans (after removal 
of alginates) in the division Phaeophyta with OSOa- 
groups at carbons C2 or C3 or containing disulfate esters 
at C2 and C3 in a-(l-4)-linked L-fucopyransoyl residues 
(sulfate esters were described in 21 species, including 
Fucus uesiculosus, Sargassum thrunbergii, and Padina 
arborescens (Nishida et al., 1990); (b) carrageenans, 
agars, porphyrans, furcellarans, and funorans, etc., in the 
division Rhodophyta-they are sulfated galactans at C2, 
C4, or C6 (disulfate esters at C2 and C6 were identified 
in &carrageenan) with different proportions of (1-3)- and 
(1-4)-~,~-1inked galactosyl residues (Stevenson and Fur- 
neaux, 1991); (c) sulfate esters at C2 and C6 of @-(1-3)- 
galactans are present in Codium taylori (division Chlo- 
rophyta) (Chapman, 1978a); (d) sulfate esters of xylans 
(in green algae, e.g., Ulva lactuca); and (e) a complex of 
hetero-polysaccharide sulfates is present in green algae, 
where the esterification of L-arabinose, D-galactose, and 
possibly D-XylOSe and L-rhamnose was observed but not 
fully investigated. (2) The presence of polyuronides that 
are represented by galacturonic, glucuronic, guluronic, 
and mannuronic acids in all three divisions mentioned 
earlier. 
The carboxyl groups, present in abundance in the four 
above-mentioned uronic acids, together with sulfate 
groups could be considered the ligands mainly re- 
sponsible for the bulk of metal sorption (Crist et al., 
1992). 
Choice of Metals. The appropriate selection of met- 
als for biosorption studies is extremely important since 
the experimental volume increases exponentially with 
each additional metallic species considered for investiga- 
tion. Depending on the angle of interest and the impact Biofechnol. Pfog,, 1995, Vol, 11, No. 3 
concentration and effective recovery that could use sorp- 
tion processes in concentrating the metallic species of 
interest from dilute solutions. 
An important consideration in studying biosorption is 
the solution chemistry of metals, particuarly as it relates 
to their hydration and hydrolysis reactions. The large 
charge-to-size ratio of cations results in an increase in 
hydration energy if no reaction beyond the coordination 
of water molecules to the cation occurs: 
M+ + nH20 - [M(HzO),l+ 241 
The hydrolysis reactions proceed when the acidity (charge- 
to-size ratio) of the cation is so great that it causes a 
rupture of the H-0 bonds with ionization of the hydrate 
to yield hydronium ions: 
Cations that hydrolyse are those that are either small 
(e.g., Be2+) and/or highly charged (e.g., Fe3+, Sn4+). 
The existence of multinuclear hydrolysis products is a 
rather general phenomenon. The hydrolyzed species can 
be considered to dimerize by a condensation process. The 
dimer can undergo an additional hydrolytic reaction, 
providing additional hydroxo groups, which in turn could 
form more bridges. The sequence of both reactions 
usually results in the formation of colloidal hydroxo 
polymers and, ultimately, in the formation of precipitates. 
The formation of mononuclear and polynuclear complexes 
is, of course, concentration dependent. The reactions 
mentioned also change the chemical composition of metal 
ion solutions during their "aging". 
In the presence of water, metal or metaloid oxides are 
generally covered with surface hydroxyl groups so that 
hydroxylated oxide particles could be, to a certain degree, 
understood as polymeric oxo acids or oxo bases. The 
charge of the metal or metaloid hydrated oxides is pH 
dependent, with the proton transfers at the amphoteric 
surface. The surface chemistry of metal oxides and 
hydroxides should be taken into account. 
Biosorption of heavy metals usually leads to the 
acidification of solutions. As the pH may have to be 
controlled, neutralization with sodium or ammonium 
hydroxides is favorable to the formation of metal hydrox- 
ides, and neutralization with amines leads to the forma- 
tion of amine-metal complexes. 
Study of the sorption of metals that tend to form 
insoluble (micr0)precipitates becomes more complicated 
due to the fact that the collection of the metal species is 
not due to the stright sequestration mechanism. In the 
case of lead in particular, its solution chemistry is more 
complex. The presence or formation of insoluble Pb- 
(NO&Pb(OH)z and Pb(N0&5Pb(OH)z complexes can 
result in a distrotion of the sorption results. The danger 
of microprecipitation starts at pH values above 5.0 for 
lead and at pH 6.7 for nickel (Britton, 1943). The 
formation of amphoretic lead hydroxides causes a prob- 
lem with pH adjustment in the study of sorption systems. 
Metal ions are coordinated by water molecules, which 
causes a hydrolytic reaction: 
Ma+ + H,O - (MOH)'"-''+ + Ht 
or more realistically The dissociation of amphoteric hydroxides (which axe 
weak acids) points to the fact that the higher the number 
of covalent M-0 bonds, the more acidic the hydrogen 
atoms in the hydrated ion, and the following neutraliza- 
tion of protons results in further release of protons. 
Moreover, the hydroxide ion has the ability to form 
bridges between metal ions. The most common example 
is the formation of hydroxo bridges at an early stage in 
the precipitation of hydrous metal oxides: 
/" 
H- -0 \ 
M 
When the solution becomes uncharged, the resulting 
pH represents an isoelectronic point with the lowest 
solubility of metal ions. While this situation is very 
favorable for the sorbent deposition of metals, it may 
make the study of the binding sites more difficult. 
Another favorable feature of the above-mentioned equa- 
tion is the fact that the addition of water (or other neutral 
groups) does not alter the valency, but increases the 
molecular mass of the complex formed, thus favoring 
sorbate deposition. While microprecipitation occurring 
in the sorption system can complicate study of the 
sorption, from the process application point of view, it 
may desirably augment the metal immobilization, thus 
increasing the apparent overall uptake capacity of bio- 
sorbent materials. 
An example using uranium, which was shown to 
biosorb so well in many investigations, may be given. The 
distribution curves available in the literature for the 
U0z2+ hydrolysis products suggest that, for low total U6' 
concentrations and for pH values below 5, UOz2+ contin- 
ues to be one of the predominant uranium species in 
solution. The following equations most probably describe 
U6+ hydrolysis in noncomplexing medium: 
UO;+ + H,O =+ U02(0H)+ +H+ 
KZ 2U07 + 2H,O == (U0,)3(OH);+ + 2H+ Kl (log Kl = -5.7) 
(log K, = -5.62) 
K3 3UO;' + 5H,O =e (U02)3(0H),+ + 5H+ 
(log K3 = -15.63) 
Assessment of Sorption Performance. Despite the 
well-established and simple foundations of the sorption 
process, there seems to be a great deal of confusion 
concerning the evaluation of experimental results on 
biosorption as they have been reported throughout recent 
literature by authors from different backgrounds. Ex- 
amination and preliminary testing of a solid-liquid 
sorption system are usually based on two types of inves- 
tigations: (a) equilibrium batch sorption tests and (b) 
dynamic continuous-flow sorption studies. 
The two widely accepted and easily linearized equilib- 
rium adsorption isotherm models for single solute sys- 
tems used in the literature are the following: 
Langmuir: q = bCtQmJ(l + bC,) 
Freundlich: q = kC;'" 
where q is the uptake of the solute (metal), qmax is the 
maximum uptake, Cf is the equilibrium (final) concentra- 
tion of solute in the solution, b and n are constants 242 Biofechnol. Prog., 1995, Vol. 11, No. 3 
often controlled by mass transfer of the sorbed solute 
(metal) to the active reaction site. While the intraparticle 
diffusion normally appears to be the overall rate-control- 
ling step, the particle external film diffusion also plays 
a role, which depends on the hydraulic flow regime 
(turbulence andor back-mixing) in the reactor system. 
The most widely used contacting device for sorption 
processes is the fured-bed reactor configuration and its 
modifications. The principles and methodology of deriv- 
ing and evaluating the key fixed-bed sorption process 
parameters have been dealt with extensively in the 
chemical engineering literature (Ruthven, 1984; Weber 
and Crittenden, 1975). related to the energy of adsorption (or “affinity”), and k 
is a constant. Both models, while capable of describing 
many biosorption isotherms, can hardly have a meaning- 
ful physical interpretation in biosorption. The results 
cannot be extrapolated, and no predictive conclusions can 
be drawn for systems operating under different condi- 
tions. These simple basic models also do not incorporate 
the effects of any external variable environmental factors. 
Moreover, biosorption isotherms may exhibit an irregular 
pattern due to the complex nature of both the sorbent 
material and its varied multiple active sites, as well as 
the complex solution chemistry of some metallic com- 
pounds. This, however, rarely has been recognized by 
students of the phenomenon, who often force smooth 
(bio)sorption isotherm curves through scattered experi- 
mental points or use the preceding simplistic sorption 
models to fit to those data points (Gadd et al., 1988; 
Holan et al., 1993; Khalid et al., 1993a,b). 
The basic evaluation of sorption systems relies on the 
classical sorption isotherm derived from equilibrium 
batch contact experiments carried out under controlled 
environmental conditions. A quantitative comparison of 
two different sorption systems can only be done at the 
same equilibrium (final, residual) concentration. Any 
other comparison carries an inherent error and can only 
serve as a qualitative comparison, often used for quick- 
screening purposes. For example, an often-used criterion, 
the percent of metal removed, does not indicate the 
concentration range. Even if all experimental param- 
eters are given, this criterion can only result in a 
qualitative, and relative comparison (better or worse 
performance) that is adequate only for material screening 
purposes. Any figures given are essentially misleading 
because they lead to inadvertent and erroneous compara- 
tive calculations. The presence of other ions in solution 
can complicate the evaluation of the sorption system to 
a large degree, depending on the way the new solute 
species interact with the sorbent and with the original 
one. Knowledge of these aspects may not be readily 
available. Appropriate and meaningful evaluation of a 
sorbent system with three or more metallic ions becomes 
very complicated, if not impossible for all practical 
purposes. 
Evaluation of equilibrium sorption performance needs 
to be supplemented by process-oriented studies of its 
kinetics and eventually by dynamic continuous-flow tests. 
The rate of the sorption metal uptake, together with the 
hydrodynamic parameters, determines the size of the 
contact equipment. Reaction engineering (Levenspiel, 
1972) concepts apply for the experimental approach, 
leading to expression of the values of key process 
parameters used for comparative, process design, and 
scale-up purposes. 
Biosorption, just like conventional sorption processes, 
involves inherently very fast sorption reaction mecha- 
nisms based predominantly on chemisorption. The ki- 
netics of such reactions is actually so fast that the 
experimental determination of metal uptake rates may 
represent a challenging problem requiring specially 
designed equipment (Tsezos and Volesky, 1982a,b; Tse- 
zos, 1981). There are indications that, in many biosorp- 
tion systems, most of the metal biosorption occurs in a 
matter of 5-15 min after solid-liquid contact (Kuyucak 
and Volesky, 1989a,b), followed in some cases by residual 
and much slower additional metal deposition (Tsezos and 
Volesky, 1981), perhaps indicating a different secondary 
metal-binding mechanism. 
For application purposes, the high rates of biosorption 
are very advantageous. Because of the fast kinetics of 
the sorption reactions, the overall sorption rate is more Example of Current Results 
Cd, Pb, Cu, and Zn Equilibrium Biosorption 
Uptake. Different types of microbial biomass were 
selected from among the industrially used fungi and 
marine algae for their ready availability and biosorbent 
potential to bind heavy metals. Industrial samples of 
dried (28 “C) Pencillium chrysogenum were supplied by 
the courtesy of Hindustan Antibiotics, Ltd. (Pimpri, be, 
India) and Sechuan Pharmaceutical Company (Chengdu, 
People’s Republic of China). The samples of brown algae 
Ascophyllum nodosum and Fucus vesiculosus were har- 
vested from the Atlantic Ocean (Nova Scotia) in October, 
dried at 60 “C, and ground. A brown alga, Sargassum 
natans, was supplied sun-dried by the University of 
Puerto Rico. Normally, the crude biomass materials were 
not purified or otherwise treated for biosorption unless 
specifically noted. Some of the biomass was reinforced 
by cross-linking using modified procedures described in 
earlier work (Holan et al., 1993; Jilek et al., 1971; 
Stamberg et al., 1977). 
Only a cross section of selected original experimental 
data will be presented in order to illustrate the types of 
investigation and results obtained in studying a variety 
of different biomass types for their biosorbent potential. 
From comparison of biosorption isotherm results derived 
from equilibrium batch experiments, conclusions can be 
drawn concerning the level of biosorption exhibited by 
different materials. Since different biosorbents have to 
be compared at the same residual equilibrium concentra- 
tions, a certain choice must be made concerning those 
concentrations. Usually it has been made on the basis 
of the selection of a low (e.g., 10 mgL) and a high (e.g., 
200 mg/L) residual metal concentration in the solution 
for comparison purposes. The values of qmax were cal- 
culated by fitting the Langmuir sorption model to the 
experimental data. 
Sample results of cadmium uptake tests for different 
types of biomass and for recommended ion-exchange 
resins are compared in Table 2. The preliminary screen- 
ing data, organized as shown in Table 2, enable a quick 
and simple comparison of the sorbent results. The 
highest metal biosorbent uptake of 170 mg of Cdg at the 
equilibrium final concentration of 200 mgA, was observed 
for native A. nodosum biomass, followed by Sargassum 
natans with 106 mg of Cdg. In comparison, the com- 
mercial ion-exchange resins (e.g., Duolite GT-75) did not 
perform as well. A relatively fast uptake rate was 
observed, whereby 73% of cadmium was sequestered from 
the solution within the first 3 min. The presence of 
cadmium in the biomass was confirmed by X-ray energy 
dispersion analysis. 
The algal biomass types examined in this work for their 
lead accumulation have been selected because of earlier 
indications of their high binding capacities for cadmium 
(Holan et al., 1993). The lead biosorption results are Biofechno1. frog., 1995, Val. 11, No. 3

summarized in Table 3. Brown algae Sargassum natans 
and Ascophyllum nodosum can be easily identified for 
their good biosorption of lead, exceeding approximately 
40 and 210 mg of Pblg for the low and high residual 
concentrations of lead in the solution, respectively. Ion- 
exchange resin IRA400 tested under the same condi- 
tions, however, demonstrated better performance at low 
residual concentrations. 
Two- and Three-Metal Sorption Systems. Among 
all the metals of interest that could be considered, for 
practical reasons the choice focused on three: Cd, Cu, 
and Zn. The sorption performance evaluation, conven- 
tionally carried out for a single metal cation in solution, 
becomes more complex when two or more metals are 
considered. The effect of other metallic ions (or anionic 
co-ions) on the performance of one-metal biosorption has been assessed in earlier studies by showing the difference 
from the original (one-metal) sorption when a known 
concentration of "contaminants" was introduced. An 
example of these results is seen in Figure 1, showing how 
little an effect of the co-ions there was on the original 
uptake of gold by Sagassum natans biomass (Kuyucak 
and Volesky, 198913). On the contrary, Figure 2 shows 
that there was a significant negative effect of Zn and 
particularly of Cu on the biosorbent uptake of Cd by 
reinforced biomass of Ascophyllum nodosum. 
It is essential to emphasize that the respective con- 
centrations of co-ions in Figures 1 and 2 mean their 
initial concentrations in the solution. This approach 
offers only very superficial information on the actual 
sorption process, whose true equilibrium relationships 
are reflected in the isotherm where the final (residual) Biotechno1. Prog., 1995, Val. 11, No. 3

concentration of the sorbate in the solution is the one 
that really matters. A better approach to the evaluation 
of the multi-ion sorption phenomenon is to use the 
relationship seen as an example in Figure 3, reflecting 
the respective equilibrium-based effects of Zn and Cu on 
the biosorbent uptake of Cd by a reinforced A. nodosum 
biosorbent. Figure 4 reveals, however, that the total 
cumulative equilibrium metal uptake for the two metals 
present in the solution for each of the two-metal sorption 
experiments was greater when compared to a single- 
metal sorption performance for Cd only. 
A two-metal system can be evaluated graphically by

representing the total uptake on the vertical axis. An 
example of the resulting 3D plot reflecting the equilib- 
rium performance of the two-metal sorption by cross- 
linked A. nodosum biomass is presented in Figure 5 for 
the (Cd+Cu) system. The limitation of this approach is 
obvious because the effects of the third and subsequent 
metallic species on the sorption performance cannot be 
depicted graphically. Instead, a multiparameter math- 
ematical approach has to be taken to describe, evaluate, 
and hopefully predict the performance of these complex 
multimetal sorption systems. This is the direction of 
current ongoing biosorption studies with multimetal 
systems.

dynamics: the fxed-bed contactor (reactor) and the the 
continuous-flow stirred-tank reactor (CSTR). Both can 
exist in different configurations and modifications featur- 
ing various process pros and cons. Perhaps the most 
efficient use of reactor space is associated with the fxed- 
bed'contactor arrangement. Very few biosorption studies 
have been reported with these systems for two practical 
reasons: the limited availability of granulated biosor- 
bents and the proprietary nature of such process design- 
oriented tests. 
A recent study (Prasetyo, 1992; Volesky and Prasetyo, 
1994) of cadmium sorption in the continuous-flow fixed- 
bed arrangement using cross-linked, granulated A. no- 
dosum biomass describes the procedures involved, re- 
sulting in valuable data that can serve as a basis for the 
scale-up of the system. The operational saturation metal 
uptake, the minimum theoretical bed depth, and the bed 
service time represent the key parameters characterizing 
biosorbent performance. The bed breakthrough exit 
concentration profiles resulting from these tests, which 
served for the derivation of the preceding process pa- rameters, are presented in Figure 6. For the duration 
of the sorption test up to the breakthrough point, the exit 
concentration of cadmium was in the range below 5 ppb 
specified as a limit for potable water. 
The calculated biosorbent use for the given operation 
of the fxed-bed contactor, removing the incoming con- 
centration of cadmium at 10 mgL, is given in Figure 7. 
Needless to say, there are several approaches to carrying 
out the dynamic tests of sorption columns, which have 
been discussed and demonstrated in the literature (Ra- 
malho, 1983; Ruthven, 1984; Weber and Crittenden, 
1975). 
Discussion 
Quantitative Evaluation of Multimetal Biosorp- 
tion Systems. While most of the studies on biosorption 
deal mainly with single-metal uptake, multimetal sorp- 
tion results are rare. Recent results with binary mix- 
tures containing two-metal combinations of Cd, Cu, and 
Zn (deCarvalho et al., 1995) demonstrate that a complete 
description of equilibrium sorption in a 3D plot could be 
very revealing. Further insight can be obtained from cuts 
through the 3D sorption surface by planes of constant 
concentration of one or the other metal. More work with 
multimetal biosorption systems is currently under way 
with the following dual purpose: to predict the biosorp- 
tion performance of new materials and to gain more 
information on the metal biosorption mechanisms. While 
this line of work usually employs equilibrium methodol- 
ogy, the ultimate purpose is to develop an adequate, 
quantitative background for the application of biosorption 
in continuous-flow sorption processes. When fixed-bed 
sorption columns are considered for this purpose, very 
little guidance exists concerning the operating param- 
eters for the column (e.g., optimal dimensions, flow rates) 
in laboratory studies, which should provide a solid basis 
for the equipment and process scale-up. This aspect 
applies to both metal uptake and its subsequent desorp- 
tion, whereby the ultimate overall evaluation of the 
sorption process performance is provided by the metal 
concentration ratio, expressed as the metal concentration 
in the solution eluted from the column upon desorption 
to the original feed metal concentration.

the biosorbent is being regenerated for reuse, the evalu- 
ation of the biosorbent deterioration has to be established, 
taking into account both its decreasing performance in 
terms of metal uptake as well as its physical deteriora- 
tion, which may also be reflected in the increasing overall 
column pressure drop. Since most of these aspects form 
a special area of general sorption process know-how, very 
little useful background literature exists to provide 
specific quantitative methodologies and guidance for the 
evaluation of sorption column performance. No system- 
atic studies have been performed with new biosorbent 
materials so far. 
Possible Effects of the Biosorbent Material Ar- 
chitecture. It is generally agreed that it is the microbial 
cell walls that are mainly responsible for the metal 
biosorption behavior. Stereochemical differences in the 
polysaccharide structures of cell walls can make a 
significant difference in the acceptance of metallic ions 
by these structures, which can have a profound bearing 
on the biosorption performance of the natural materials 
containing them. 
Indications of the advantages of morphologically dif- 
ferent architecture of algal tissues in relation to increas- 
ing the metal biosorbent uptake could be seen in com- 
paring the sorption performances of F. vesiculosus and 
A. nodosum. The thallus of the former consists of 
parenchymatous cells with apical meristems (Chapman, 
1978101, instead of the predominantly filamentous archi- 
tecture of the latter. The architecture of parenchymatous 
cells represents a greatly increased surface area that is 
available for sorption. Comparison of the density of 
cross-linked particles of F. vesiculosus and A. nodosum 
indicated a 34% higher density of the latter (Holan et 
al., 1993). This means that morphological differences 
existing within the same order can influence the sorption 
process. Also, the structure of alignates present can 
differ between young and old tissues, as well as between 
different parts of the same plant (Haug et al., 1974). The 
content of sulfate groups as well as uronic acids in the algal biomass examined differed not only between species 
but even seasonally and geographically within the same 
species (Percival and McDowell, 1967), with the varia- 
tions being responsible for potentially differing sorption 
capabilities. 
There was a conspicuous difference observed in our 
work with seaweed materials between the biosorbent 
uptakes of lead and nickel: the latter was 1 order of 
magnitude lower (Holan and Volesky, 1994). Several 
factors may be responsible for this difference. The lead 
and nickel sorptions follow the general rule that metal 
sorption increases with increasing valence and atomic 
number. The lower sorption of nickel than of lead could 
be related to the fact that nickel has a much lower 
selectivity coefficient for alginates than lead, which 
features the highest coefficient, reflected in the highest 
values of alginate gel shrinkage (Percival and McDowell, 
1967). Nickel belongs to the intermediate metals with 
high affinity not only to ligands like phosphoryl, S032-, 
RNH2, and RzNH but mainly to COO- groups, which it 
likely shares with lead. The cis position of sulfate esters 
at C3 and C4 of the branched fucose residue may be 
instrumental in the strong binding of lead to only one 
sugar residue. However, the same site could sequester 
nickel by an ion-exchange mechanism. Sulfate groups 
at other carbons could assist in forming covalent bonds 
between adjacent chains of fucoidans and other sulfated 
polysaccharides. This covalent bond (polysaccharide- 
OS0~-Pb-S0~0-polysaccharide) practically represents 
another type of cross-linking worthy of attention in 
studies of the metal-loaded biosorbent behavior during 
desorption. At the same time, it is interesting to note 
that the methodologies for quantitative evaluation of 
metal desorption have not been developed for routine use. 
Biosorbents for Sorption Column Applications. 
Biomass of any kind cannot be used directly in the 
standard sorption process. Usually it is very soft, and 
without reinforcement and granulation it cannot be used 
in column operations. Early attempts were performed 
with the cross-linking of Penicillium sp. with a urea- 
formaldehyde mixture (Jilek et al., 1978; Stamberg et al., 
1977; Votapek et al., 1976). Further attempts have been 
reported but are not necessarily well described (Brierley, 
J. A., 1990; Brierley et al., 1988; Greene and Darnall, 
1990; Holan et al., 1993; Tsezos, 1990). 
Cross-linking could be classified according to the 
formation of ethers or esters of the natural biopolysac- 
charides present in the biomass. Ethers could be formed 
via aldehydes (formaldehyde, dialdehydes, acrolein), N- 
hydroxymethyl compounds (triazine, ureas, amides, car- 
bamates), activated vinyl compounds (diethenyl sulfone, 
acrylamides, vinyl ketones, and crotonates), epoxy and 
aziridinyl compounds (l-chloro-2,3-epoxypropane, diep- 
oxides, dihalohydrins, triaziridinylphosphine oxide, and 
reaction products of ethylene imine with bis(ch1orofor- 
mate), acid chlorides of dicarboxylic acids, diisocyanates, 
etc.), bifunctional aliphatic chlorides, disulfonate esters 
of polymethylene diols, and bis(diazo1alkanes. Esters 
could be formed via acid anhydrides (phthalic, maleic, 
and succinic anhydrides), acid chlorides of dicarboxylic 
acids (from succinyl to sebacoyl), dicarboxylic acids, 
diisocyanates, and cross-linking of polysaccharide deriva- 
tives (including modification by introducing new reactive 
groups for new types of covalent bonds or the formation 
of new substrates that would be cross-linked with a 
known system): reactions with unsaturated compounds; 
reactions with mercapto groups; reactions with dialde- 
hyde or otherwise modified polysaccharide with diamines, 
hydrazides, alkanedithiols, disulfides, etc.; reversible 
cross-links containing disulfide groups. Biotechnol. frog., 1995, Val. 11, No. 3 
The higher sorption values observed with several cross- 
linked types of biomass revealed an additional advantage 
of cross-linking, because the majority of sulfate groups 
and uronic acids present in the cellular polysaccharides 
could be covalently attached to the structural polysac- 
charide network. The cross-linking ofA. nodosum native 
biomass with diethenyl sulfone confirmed the possibility 
of increasing the sorption capacity of the biosorbent 
material by the incorporation of sulfone groups. Cross- 
linking of native biomass with diethenyl sulfone (Holan 
and Volesky, 1995) revealed the possibility of increasing 
the metal sorption capacity of native biomaterials by the 
incorporation of sulfone groups with two coordinate links: 247

Free aldehydic groups originating from dialdehydes used 
for cross-linking and incompletely anchored at one end 
only could, afier the reduction of metal ions and the 
oxidation of aldehydic groups to carboxyl groups, also 
possibly increase the sorption capacity of a prepared 
biosorbent. 
Modifications of the cellulosic materials tested (Holan 
and Volesky, 1994) demonstrated that processed natural 
materials, e.g., phosphated sawdust, could successfully 
compete with fungal biomass in sequestering metals. The 
mechanism of ion exchange apparently prevails:

U /\ 
In I celluloseCHp0 -P metal + 2NaC

This approach has already been used for example, for 
thorium recovery from monazite in the past (Head et al., 
1959). The oxidation of sawdust to oxo and carboxy 
forms, as well as the introduction of carboxymethyl and 
sulfoethyl groups, was tested for illustrating biomass 
transformation into a better metal-sorbent material and 
for pointing to the eventual possibility of studying differnt 
metal-sequestering functional groups and metal uptake 
mechanisms. 
There is a great deal of suitable cross-linking proce- 
dures that could be used in the reinforcement of any kind 
of biomass. However, there may be a limitation in the 
first step of cross-linking: alkaline or acidic conditions 
required for the reaction to proceed are usually very 
strong. While the durability of different cross-linked 
materials to extreme acidic and alkaline conditions has 
been studied only to a rather limited extent (Andrews et 
al., 19621, another limitation for cross-linked biosorbents 
may relate to the pH range in which they should 
eventually work. This could relate not only to the metal 
sorption cycle but also, perhaps particularly, to the 
desorptiodregeneration cycles where more extreme pH 
process conditions are likely to occur. 
Apart from successfully attaining appropriate rigidity 
and swelling characteristics of biosorbent particles, cross- 
linked biosorbents have to feature a well-controlled, 
uniform size and porosity in order to meet the process 
requirements relating to the micro- and macroscopic 
mass transfer characteristics of the material when used 
in the actual sorption process. These aspects still 
represent an outstanding research and development challenge, which is expanded by the variable nature of 
the individual raw biomass types already identified for 
their extremely exciting metal-sorbing capabilities. 
Conclusions 
There has been steady progress in studying the bio- 
sorption of heavy metals, resulting in the identification 
of some biomass types that show very promising uptake 
of metallic ions. The focus is on several fungal strains 
generated as a byproduct of fermentation processes and 
several species of abundant brown marine algae. A 
better understanding of the biosorbent mechanisms 
responsible for heavy metal binding assists in the opti- 
mization of performance of the new biosorbent materials 
being prepared from these biomass types for process 
application in detoxifying metal-bearing industrial ef- 
fluents. 
While the equilibrium biosorption performance assess- 
ment uses batch tests, resulting in biosorption isotherm 
data, solutions with multiple metals have to be examined 
using advanced methodologies based on three-dimen- 
sional plotting and mathematical modeling of sorption 
performance. The current trends in this report point 
toward exploitation and suitable adaptation of existing 
mathematical models, as well as toward the synthesis of 
more advanced computer models reflecting the ligand- 
metal interaction on a molecular level and the process 
mass transfer and hydrodynamics on a macroscopic scale 
relating to the process equipment design and scale-up. 
Work is currently in progress in several key academic 
laboratories that addresses the fundamental as well as 
applied aspects of the biosorption process, relating par- 
ticularly to the better understanding of biosorption 
mechanisms, metal desorption and biosorbent regenera- 
tion, formulation of new biosorbent materials suitable for 
process application, and development of new methodolo- 
gies to facilitate the quantitative process description, its 
performance prediction, and optimization. At the same 
time, commercial interest in the exploitation of new 
biosorption technology is on the rise.
