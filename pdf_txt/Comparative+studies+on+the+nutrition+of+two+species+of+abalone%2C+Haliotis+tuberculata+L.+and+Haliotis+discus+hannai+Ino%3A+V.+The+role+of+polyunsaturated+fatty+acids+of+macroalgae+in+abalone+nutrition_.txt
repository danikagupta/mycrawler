Abstract :    
 
The commercial culture of Haliotis tuberculata  has recently started in Europe. As abalone is herbivorous, 
the use of local collected algae as feed may appear advantageous. The nutritional value of eight 
monospecific seaweed diets was studied using Palmaria palmata  (Rhodophyta), filamentous algae, 
mainly Gracilaria  sp. (Rhodophyta), Enteromorpha  sp. and Ulva lactuca  (Chlorophyta), together with 
Saccharina latissima , Saccorhiza polyschides , Laminaria digitata  and Laminaria hyperborea  (Ochrophyta, 
Phaeophyceae) and a mixed macroalgal diet. An integrative approach consi sted in monitoring the 
seasonal composition changes of these algae in terms of protein, lipid, soluble carbohydrate, fatty acid 
and amino -acid contents, and to relate it to seasonal growth and reproduction investment during a large -
scale experiment. Abalon e and algae were studied for one year in commercial sea -cage structures. 
Abalone fed with monospecific diet using either P. palmata  or S. latissima,  and with mixed diet presented 
the best growth rate, muscle ratio and gonad development. Seasonal daily weig ht gain was mainly 
associated with n -3/n-6 ratio, soluble carbohydrate content and total protein content. In term of amino -
acid contents, the daily weight gain was associated with free phenylalanine as well as isoleucine levels. 
Moreover, 90% of 2 -years ol d abalone started gonad development but less than a quarter featured a fully 
matured gonad. The gonad development of H. tuberculata  was mostly associated to total valine, 
methionine, leucine, arginine and isoleucine levels. The age of initial sexual maturi ty in H. tuberculata  
turned to be a highly plastic trait in response to different growth rates and algal diets. Even if P. palmata  
is the best option for growth performance, mixed diets should probably be preferred to a monospecific 
diet in order to avoid too high pressure on a single algal resource.

1. Introduction  
 
Abalone farming in Europe is a small growing industry (Cook, 2014) . The main advantages of 
an ecological and profitable abalone aquaculture business are the minimization of effluents and 
the use of a local and cheap sustainable resource as feed (Troell et al., 2006 ). In this context, 
the use of algal diet to feed the local species, Haliotis tuberculata , may appear advantageous. 
In addition, a balone health and condition can be  improved when fed macroalgal diet (Dang et 
al., 2011 ; Stone et al., 2014 ). Nevertheless, feeding abalone with locally collected algae also 
presents many constra ints. The main issues are about availability, cost and nutritional value of 
feed that will allow good growth rates and survival. Costs of seaweeds can vary depending on 
the cultivation or harvest techniques, species choice and environmental factors (Kirkendale et 
al., 2010 ). A huge variability of feeding costs using algae were reported, representing 
approximately 14% of the  production costs for a land -based cultivation system of Australian 
abalone (Kirkendale et al., 2010 ) and up to 60% for Halioti s tuberculata  farmed in sea -rearing 
systems ( www.sudevab.com consulted 29/03/2012 ). When comparing cost and growth between 
a P. palmata diet, which gives the best growth performance for H. tuberculata  (Mai et al., 
1996 ), and a formulated diet, similar results were found (Basuyaux, 2000 ). The availability of 
wild harvested macroalgae is a major issue  for the development of aquaculture production 
(Troell et al., 2006 ). France has a high potential for macroalgal harvesting (Alban et al., 2011 ) 
with at least  20 species gathered, most of them coming from  Brittany (Mesnildrey et al., 2012 ). 
Palmaria palmata  is characterized by a high market price in Brittany (0.4 up to 2 € / kg fresh 
weight, Basuyaux et al. 2018, Huchette , pers. comm.). The most harvested species is Laminaria 
digitata  with more than 40  000 tons harvested annually  (0.04 € / kg up to 0.5 € /kg fresh weight, 
Basuyaux et al. 2018 , Huchette, pers. comm.) , followed by L. hyperborea  reaching 26  000 tons. 
In contr ast, less than 300 tons of species such as P. palmata  or Ulva  species are harvested ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
annually.  Most of the algae harvested in France are used for food processing industry, chemistry 
and microbiology while less than 25% of seaweed is used in agricultural, health and well -being 
sectors (Mesnildrey et al., 2012 ).  
 
In order to avoid the use of a single algal species by the industry, which would represent a 
danger for the sustainability of this species, alternating feeding with various species should be 
instituted if the European  abalone industry wants to sustain its durability. In order to optimise 
feeding, algae need to be chemically characterised, their biochemical composition being highly 
species - (Mercer et al., 1993 ; Mai et al., 1994 ; Mai et al., 1995 ; Jung et al., 2013 ), seasonal - 
and site -  (Renaud and Luong -Van, 2006 ; Villares et al., 2013 ; Schmid et al., 2014 )  dependent. 
Red algae , such as P. palmata  and Gracilaria spp. are known to contain a relatively large 
proportion of  protein  with a year average of 18.3 % (Jacquin et al., 2006 ). A 30 % total protein 
content was reported  in G. bursa -pastoris a (Valente et al., 2006 ) and G. cornea  cultivated in 
tanks enriched with fertiliser . Green species belonging to Ulva  spp and Enteromorpha  spp. 
monitored in Japan contain respectively 26.1% and 19.5% of proteins, 0.7% and 0.3% of lipids 
and 46.1% and 58.1% of carbohydrates (Nisizawa et al., 1987 ). In Brittany,  the protein content 
of P. palmata  varied from 9.7 % to 25.5 % of dry weight depending of the season : the protein 
content was reported to be lower during summer and autumn (12 – 15 %) and higher during 
winter and spring (22 – 25 %) (Galland -Irmouli et al., 1999 ; Jacquin et al., 2006 ). In Ireland, a 
protein content of 13% was reported in winter and spring in Ulva lactuca (Mercer et al., 1993 ). 
In this context, spatial and seasonal variations in the biochemical compositions of specific algal 
species available to this industry  need to be studied in relation to H. tuberculata  needs.  
 
Only a few studies directly compared the effects of different macroalgal diets on growth 
focusing on their seasonal composition changes on the long term (Basuyaux et al., 2018 ) and ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
on a commercial scale  (Nelson et al., 2002 ). The first objective of this study was to determine  
the nutritional value of eight  monospecific seaweed diets and their respective impact on  the 
growth and reproduction of  H. tuberculata , reared in large sea -based growing structures during 
one year. The second objective was to evaluate the  seasonal variation of algal composition. The 
third objective was to determine  the role of each major algal component  in relation to the 
seasonal growth and reproduction of farmed abalone. Because the literature consistently 
demonstrate s that growth is improved when abalone are fed with a combination of macro algal 
species in preference to a single species (Stuart and Brown, 1994 ; Simpson and Cook, 1998 ; Qi 
et al., 2010a ; Viera et al., 2011 ), a mixed diet based on algae easily collected on the shore at 
each specific season was also studied.  
 
2. Materials and Methods  
2.1. Animals  
This study was located downstream from the Aber Wrac'h river (48°36'46N; 4°33'30W), 
Brittany, France between the begin ning of February 2012 and the end of January 2013. Abalone 
were born in summer 2010 at the local hatchery France Haliotis (Plouguerneau, France). After 
one year spent in the land -based nursery tanks, juveniles were transferred to the sea in pre -
growing com partment s. During this stage, they were fed a mixed algal diet based essentially on 
P. palmata , S. latissima  and L. digitata  and received more occasionally smaller quantity of the 
other experimental algal diets . In February 2012 (t 0), abalone were placed in 9 abblox farming 
sea cag es. Each cage was made of 4 compartment s of 1 m3 (1 m x 1 m x 1 m) with a squared 
mesh size of 5 mm, each compartment  containing 1000 individuals. Initial abalone length (L t0 
= 24 ± 0.15 mm; mean ± s.e.) an d weight (W t0 = 2.2 ± 0.041 g; mean ± s.e.) were balanced 
between the treatments at the beg inning of the experiment (Table 1 ). Eighteen rows of 30 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
circular black plastic oyster -seed collectors  of 140 mm di ameter were placed into the 
compartment s as shelter  for daytime. Each compartment  was identified with a tag attached 
inside the compartment  enabling to identify the seaweed diet and compartment  number. The 
cages were moored on a long -line used for anchorage.  
 
 
2.2. Experimental design  
Abalone fed on monospeci fic diets of eight algal species . Among the large diversity of 
macroalgae in Brittany, we selected Palmaria palmata (P) and filamentous algae, mainly  
Gracilaria sp. (G) (Rhodophyta), Enteromorpha sp. (E) and Ulva lactuca (U) (Chlorophyta), 
Saccharina latissima (S), Saccorhiza polyschides (B), Laminaria  digitata  (L) and Laminaria 
hyperborea (D) (Ochrophyta Phaeophyceae). A ninth treatment ( M: mixed diet) corresponded 
to the algae usually distributed to abalone in rearing facilities with different propor tions 
according to the seasonal availability on the coast (yearly average distribution in wet weight; 
B: 15.5 %; D: 20.5%; P: 43%; S: 8%; U: 12%). Abalone were fed ad libitum  at spring tide every 
month with algae harvested on the coast of Plouguerneau  maxi mum 24 hours before 
distribution . The quantity of algae was adjusted each month in order to reach ad libitum  algal 
distribution. The goal was to fill the compartment  with algae in excess so that not all were eaten 
by the end of the month  (at least 5% refus al). The quantity distributed ranged from 10 kg up to 
25 kg according to the algae and the season. Each treatment was replicated three times,  each 
replicate being randomly placed in one of the nine abblox (Figure 1). An additional 
compartment  was filled only with algae in order to monitor in situ  algal degradation. Due to the 
difficulty to harvest Sacchoriza polyschides  and Enteromorpha sp. on the coast at the end of 
autumn period, the B and E treatments were stopped in October.  ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
Multivariate i ntegrative analysis of abalone seasonal growth and reproduction status was 
associated to detailed seasonal biochemical composition of algal diets, based on lipid content 
and fatty acid composition, soluble carbohydrate , protein content and amino -acid compo sition.  
 
2.3. Abalone measurements  
2.3.1. Mortality  
Empty shells were collected before each feeding. Mortality (%) after 11 months of diet was 
calculated as:  
𝑀𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦 =(total  number  of dead  abalone  / initial  number  of abalone )∗100 
 
2.3.2. Growth  
At the beginning of February  2012  (t0), April (t 2), June (t 4), August (t 6), the end of  October (t 8) 
and the end of January 2013 (t 11), 30 individuals from each compartment , i.e. 90 individuals 
per treatment, were randomly collected (the 2nd nearest neighbour to the first sighted chosen 
randomly ) and brought back to France Haliotis  farm . After pressing the abalone in absorbent 
paper to remove water from the pallial cavity, abalone were weighed to the nearest 0.01 g using 
a balance (Toploader balance, Kern) (Wt0 , W t2 , W t4, W t6 ,Wt8, Wt11) and shell length was 
measured to the nearest 0. 5 mm using a Vernier calliper (Lt0 , L t2 , Lt4, Lt6, Lt8, Lt11). After 
sampling, abalone individuals were removed from the experiment.  
 
The following growth indices were calculated:  
Final weight -to-shell length ratio ( W/L t11, g.mm-1) = Wt11/Lt11   
Final daily weight gain  (DGW t0-11  in mg.day-1) =(Wt11 −Wt0)/day 
Final daily length gain (DGL t0-11 in µm.day-1)  = (Lt11 −Lt0)/day ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
Specific growth rate ( SGRw,  %.day-1) = 100  x ((LnW t11−LnW t0)/day)  
With W t0: mean initial wet weight, W t11: mean final wet weight, and day: days between initial 
and final measures  
 
In addition, intermediate daily weight gain  (DGW) and daily length  gain (DLG) were c alculated 
for each period  (t0-2, t2-4, t4-6, t6-8, t8-11). 
 
The final weight -to-shell length ratio ( W/L) was calculated in order to give an indication of the 
flesh volume per unit shell length growth as recommended by  Naidoo et al.  (2006 ). The value 
of an abalone priced by weight will depend on this ratio. In addition, this is an  indicator of 
transformation rate if abalone individuals are sold eviscerated. Growth d ata were averaged per 
replicate ( compartment ) for analysis.  
 
2.3.3. Gonad development  
Twelve individuals per replicate were randomly sampled in July 2012 (n = 36 individuals per 
treatment).  This corresponds to the beginning of the spawning period in H. tuberculata  (Girard, 
1972 ). For each individual, the muscle was separated from the gonad -digestive gland ( GDG  
comprising crop, stomach, spiral cecum and gonad ) and from the rest of the soft tissues (head, 
gills, heart, mantle, hypobranchial glands, anus, and intestine)  by the same experimenter to 
reduce dissection variability . Total soft tissue (weighed before muscle separation), muscle, 
GDG, the rest of the soft tissues and shell were weighed to the nearest 0. 01 g , just after 
dissection . Shell length was measured to the nearest 0.5 mm.  Reproduction data were averaged 
per replicate ( compartment ) for analysis.  
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
A visual gonad index ( VGI) ranked from 0 to 10 based on the progression of the early stages of 
gonad de velopment was directly scored after dissection. Photographs were taken in order to 
verify direct observation afterward. The scores were adapted from the criteria defined by 
McAveney et al. (2004 ). This fine scale VGI allows good estimates of the error variance in the 
data and is adapted to distinguish between samples at the early stages of gonad development. 
Because of the extensive reticulation with t he gut and small size of the GDG, the gonads could 
not be separated from the gut during dissection. In order to determine the relative proportion of 
gonads from the conical appendage, the GDG was sectioned across the midpoint of the conical 
appendage. The samples were fixed in Davidson solution for 24  h and then kept in 70  % alcohol. 
Thereafter, samples were dehydrated using several baths of 95  % and 100  % alcohol, and 
Claral® before being embedded in paraffin for histology. Scans were done of the gonadal 
sections  using a desktop scanner . The numbers of pixels in the total area of section and the 
gonadal area were determined using ImageJ 1.45s (Wayne Rasband National Institutes of 
Health, USA).  
The gonadal index (GI) was calculated, adapted from Shepherd an d Laws (1974 ), as followed :  
𝐺𝐼 = number  of pixels  for the gonadal  area  / total  number  of pixels  of the section  
 
 
In order to study the relative organ development of abalone from each diet, the following 
variables were related to wet weight, with respect to the total weight ( Tw = total soft tissue 
weight + shell weight):  
𝐺𝐷𝐺𝑟  = (GDG  weight  / Tw)∗100 
𝑀𝑟 = (muscle  weight  / Tw)∗100 
𝑆𝑟 = (shell  weight  / Tw)∗100

2.4. Algal measurements  
 
2.4.1. Algal degradation in sea -cage structure  
Every month, algae left in the additional compartment  without abalone was collected and 
weighed back on land with a 0.02 kg precision scale after draining of 1 hour. The degradation  
(Pdegraded)  corresponded to the proportion of algae left in the compartment  without abalone 
after one month. It was calculated as: ((Qdist -Qcoll )/Qdist)*100 with Qdist: total quantity of 
seaweed distributed and Qcoll: quantity of seaweed after one month in the cage without 
abalone.  Pdegraded  was analy sed for 5 periods: t0-2, t2-4, t4-6, t6-8, t8-11. 
 
2.4.2. Biochemical analysis  
For biochemical analy ses, 100 g of freshly harvested macroalgae of each treatment were 
sampled in triplicate. Algae were immediately frozen and stored in a freezer at -20°C before 
freeze -drying at -55°C dur ing 96 hours. The dry matter content of each species ( drymatter ) was 
determined weighting the samples before and after freeze -drying. The dry seaweeds were then 
ground to pieces of about 0.5 mm with a hammer mill. For lipid analysis, algae w ere 
immediately  frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored in a freezer at -80°C before gr inding.  
2.4.3. Soluble c arbohydrate analy ses 
Samples were analy sed at t0, t2, t4, t6 and t8. Soluble  carbohydrate contents ( potentially available,  
carb) were determined by an adaptation of the phenol sulphuric acid colorimetric method of 
Dubois et al . (1956 ). This method is based on the reduction of neutr al sugars, and a little part 
of uronic acids, in 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural by phenol, giving a characteristic yellow colour. 
Absorbencies were measured at 492 nm with a microplate photometer (MultiskanTM FC, ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
Thermo Scientific) and compared to glucose standar d curve. Titrations were done in triplicate 
and averaged for each sample.   
 
2.4.4. Lipid analy ses 
Due to practical constraint s, samples were only analy sed at t 2. Lipid extraction was conducted 
on 150 to 200 mg algal powder  according to Folch  et al.’s method  (1957)  in 6 mL of a 
chloroform/methanol mixture (2/1, v/v). Lipid extracts were then ﬂushed with nitrogen and 
stored at −20 °C before analysis. Fatty acids (FA) were  analy sed as fatty acid methyl esters 
(FAME) after total lipid transesterification. Briefly, after addition of tricosanoic acid (23:0) as 
an internal standard and evaporation to dryness under nitrogen, 800  µL of MeOH/BF 3 (14 % 
by weight) was added and the transesterification reaction occurred during 10  min at 100°C, as 
described by Le Grand et al. (2014 ). Then, 0.8 mL of hexane was added and the organi c phase 
containing FAME was washed three times with 1.5 mL of hexane -saturated distilled water. The 
organic phase was ﬁnally recovered for HPLC purification to isolate FAME. FAME were then 
analy sed by a gas chromatograph (GC) VARIAN CP 3800 equipped with t wo automatic on 
column injectors and two flame ionization detectors (FID). FAME were separated using both 
polar (CPWAX 52 CB ––30 m 9 0.25 mm i.d.; 0.25 lm thickness, Varian) and non -polar (CP -
Sil 8 CB ––30 m 9 0.25 mm i.d.; 0.25 lm thickness, Varian) capill ary columns. Combined with 
the use of commercial and home -made analytical standards, this allowed  to separate and 
identify FAME. The quantity of each fatty acid was quantified on a proportional basis relative 
to the peak area of the C23:0 internal standard . Quantitative fatty acid spectra obtained by GC 
were used to calculate the molar content of each fatty acid in the samples. Depending on the 
number of double bonds they display ed, FA were classified in three groups: saturated FA (SFA, 
no insaturation), mo nounsaturated (MUFA, only one insaturation) and polyunsaturated (PUFA, 
two or more insaturations). FA could also be differentiate d by the position of the first double ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
bond from the terminal carbon: n -3 (omega 3) or n -6 (omega 6). The results used in the PC A 
were: total lipid content ( liptot , µg FA / mg dry matter ), n-3/n-6 ratio ( n3n6 ), MUFA content 
(lipmono , % of total FA), PUFA content ( lippoly , % of total FA)  and SFA content ( lipsat , % of 
total FA).  
 
2.4.5. Protein and amino -acid analy ses  
The protein content ( prot) was determined for t 0, t4, and t 8 based on Lowry ’s method (1951 ). 
Titrations were done in triplicate for each sample  and averaged . The results obtained were used 
for the amino -acid quantification.  
Three samples for a period were pooled in equivalent quantity for amino -acid content analysis. 
A hydrolysis was performed on the samples prior to amino -acid analysis. Hydrolysats were 
dried under vacuum, suspended in 1 mL of water containing 100 μM 3 -aminobutyri c acid 
(BABA) and used for subsequent analysis. For free amino -acid content, 10 mg of the ground 
freeze -dried  samples were used. A methanol –chloroform –water -based extraction was 
performed according to the following procedure: ground samples were suspended in 400 μL of 
methanol containing 200 μM 3 -aminobutyric acid. Suspensions were agitated for 15 min at 
room tem perature. Then, 200 μL of chloroform were added, followed by a 5 min agitation step. 
Finally, 400 μL of water were added, and samples were vortexed vigorously and centrifuged at 
13 000 g for 5 min to induce phase separation. The upper phase, which containe d amino acids, 
was transferred to a clean microtube and used for subsequent analysis.  
For total and free amino acid profiling, 50 μL of each methanol –water extract were dried under 
vacuum. Dry residues were suspended in 50 μL of ultrapure water and 5 μL w ere used for the 
derivatization employing the AccQ -Tag Ultra derivatization kit (Waters, Milford, MA, USA). 
Derivatized amino acids were analyze d using an Acquity UPLC -DAD system (Waters). BABA 
was used as internal standard.  ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
 
Based on King et al. (1996 ) who described the essential amino acids for abalone, the following 
amino acids were used for the PCA analysis : arginine ( F-Arg, T-Arg; with F indicating the free 
amino -acid and T total amino -acid), histidine ( F-Hist, T -Hist), isoleucine ( F-Ile, T -Ile), leucine 
(F-Leu, T -Leu), lysine ( F-Lys, T -Lys), methionine ( F-Met and T -Met), phenylalanine ( F-Phe, 
T-Phe), threonine ( F-Thr, T -Thr), tryptophan ( F-Tr, T -Tr) and valine ( F-Val, T -Val). 
 
2.5. Data analysis  
 
Data are represented as means and standard error (SE). Statistical analysis was performed with 
R version 3.5.1 software.   
To study the effect of period and algae species on chemical algal composition, an analysis of 
variance was used, with algae (B, D, E, G, H, L, P and U)  and period (t 0-2, t2-4, t4-6, t6-8, t8-11 for 
dry matter content, degradation and carbohydrate analysis; t 0, t4, t8, for protein analysis ; period 
was not included in the model for lipid because only one period analysis), and the interaction 
between algae and period as fixed factors. When normal distribution of the residuals and 
homogeneity of variances were verified and global effects were found, post-hoc Tukey tests for 
multiple comparisons of means were carried out. When normal distribution of the residuals or 
homogeneity of variances was not verified, log, square root or inverse transformations were 
used. If analysis of variance conditions were not fu lfilled, a Welch test was performed  to study 
algal effect . If significant, pairwise post -hoc comparisons were carried out using Games -Howell 
post-hoc test based on Welch’s degrees of freedom correction and uses Tukey’s studentized 
range distribution . A Fri edman test was used to test algal seasonal effect when conditions of ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
analysis of variance were not fulfilled. However, interaction between the seasonal and algal 
effect could not tested with these non -parametric tests.  
 
For i nitial and final g rowth  variabl es as well as reproduction  variables, data were averaged per 
compartment before analysis  (3 replicate  per treatment , each replicate corresponding to the 
average of the 30 abalone growth measures, and 12 abalone reproduction measures). An 
analysis of variance was used to compare the effect of algal diets (B, D, E, G, H, L, M, P and 
U diets) on the growth and reproduction parameters. If conditions of analysis of variance were 
not fulfilled, a Welch test was performed. If significant, pair wise post -hoc comparisons were 
carried out using Games -Howell post -hoc test based on Welch’s degrees of freedom correction 
and uses Tukey’s studentized range distribution . 
 
The seasonal effect of algal diet on the two-month daily weight gain and daily length gain was 
analysed by a linear mixed effects analysis using the lmerTest package (Bates et al., 2012 ) and 
using the method described by Winter (2013 ). Square root transformation  was used to 
homogenise  variances between the treatment s for DGW . The model included the period  (t0-2, 
t2-4, t4-6, t6-8, t8-11), the 6 monospecific algal diets (D, G, H, L, P and U), and an interaction 
between period and diet as fixed effects . The cages were indicated as a random factor ( 18 
cages ). B and E diets  could  not be included in the model due to missing data for the last period . 
In addition, b ecause M diet was composed of algae in different proportion at each season, it 
was not included in the model . For the post -hoc analysis, the difflsmeans package was used. It 
calculated differences of Least Squares Means for the factors of lmer mixed effect s model and 
used the Satterthwaite's approximation to degrees of freedom.  
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
Multiple linear regression analysis was not performed because normality of the residues , and 
linearity between dependent variables and algal composition variables could not be fulfi lled as 
well as the low number of observations per predictor  (Quinn and Keough, 2002 ). Instead, a 
descriptive Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed with the package FactoMineR 
(Lé et al., 2008 ). All the variables were reduced and scaled. Because the proportion of al gae 
eaten was not measured in the mixed diet, the PCA was performed only on the 8 monospecific 
diets, using the two -month daily weight gain and daily length  gain (DGW and DGL for t 0-2, t2-
4, t4-6, t6-8, t8-11), and the biochemical algal analysis correspond ing to the same period. Because it 
would have been too difficult to interpret with the large numbers of variables, a  second PCA 
was performed with the same variables to study relationship between growth and amino -acid 
free and total composition.  
 
3. Results  
 
3.1. Abalone measurements  
Initial m ean weight and length were not significantly different  (p > 0.05) . Howeve r, after one -
year experiment, a diet treatment effect was observed on all growth parameters, i.e. on the mean 
final length (p < 0.001) and weigh t (p < 0.001) , on DGL t0-11 (p < 0.001) , on DGW t0-11  (p < 
0.001) , on SGRw  (p < 0.001)  and on W/L t11 (p < 0.001) . No effect w as reported on mortality 
(p > 0.05)  (see Table  1 for p and F values ). 
After one -year experiment, t he best growth performances in weight were observed for abalone 
fed the P. palmata  diet, followed by the mixed diet. Abalone fed with S. latissima , Gracilaria 
sp. and L. digitata  presented intermediate growth performances. The lowest performances were 
observed for abalone fed Enteromorpha sp., U. lactuca, S. polyschides and stipes of ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
L. hyperborea . This diet ranking performance was maintained for the fin al weight -to-shell 
length ratio  (see Table 1  for post -hoc analysis comparison ). 
Concerning tissue and shell development of aba lone after 6 months of treatment, diet effect was 
observed for GDGr, Mr, Sr, GI and for VGI (p < 0.001) (See Table 2 for p and F values). 
Abalone from L. digitata  and Enteromorpha sp. diets had the highest GDGr whereas those fed 
on S. polyschides , stipes of L. hyperborea  and mixed diets had the lowest ratio. Abalone fed P. 
palmata  and mixed diets had the highest Mr and VGI while abalone from Enteromorpha sp. 
and L. digitata  diets had the lowest ratio. In contrast, the Sr was the most important for a balone 
fed on stipes of L. hyperborea  diet and the lowest for P. palmata  and mixed diets.  
A regression of the GDG wet weight against total wet weight gave a positive relationship (r² = 
0.873, n = 295, slope = 0.123, intercept = -0.076, p < 0.001). The regression of VGI against 
total wet weight gave a positive relationship (r2 = 0.530, n = 295, slope = 0.632, intercept = 
3.175, p < 0.001): abalone with the higher VGI were also the largest.  
 
When studying more specifically the effect of the period and die t on abalone seasonal DGW 
and DGL, an important period  effect (mixed model,  DGW:  F4,60 = 25.61, p < 0.001; DGL: F 4,60 
= 10.60 , p < 0.001), a diet effect (mixed model, DGW: F 5,60 = 36.09, p < 0.001; DGL: F 5,60 = 
14.70 , p < 0.001) as well as an  interaction between diet and period (mixed model, DGW: F 20,60 
= 2.38, p < 0.01; DG L: F20,60 = 1.98, p < 0.0 5) were  observed . The periods from late spring to 
the end of autumn (t 4-6 and t 6-8) were the best for  abalone  DGL and DGW compared to late 
winter (t 0-2), and spring (t 2-4) periods, the worst  period  being in winter (t 8-11) for DGL  (Figure 
2). However, the seasonal effect was different depending o n algal diet s. For example, abalone 
fed with algae such as P. palmata  and U. lactuca  had similar DGL and DGW  from t 0 to t 8, and 
presented a decrease in DGL and DGW only in winter (t 8-11) (Figure 3). Abalone fed other diets ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
such as L. digitata  presented important DGL and DGW variation depending o n the period  
(Figure 3). 
 
3.2. Algal biochemical measurements  
Biochemical composition of the  eight  algal diets  distributed to abalone during one  year 
significantly differed in term of proteins, free and total amino -acids, fatty acids and soluble 
carbohydrates (p < 0.01, see Table 3 for p and F details ). P. palmata , S. latissima  and L. digitata  
presented the higher yearly total carbohydrate content while Enteromorpha  sp., U. lactuca, S. 
polyschides and stipes of L. hyperborea were the poorest. Enteromorpha  sp. presented the 
highest total lipid content with 4  % of tota l lipids. P. palmat a and Enteromorpha  sp. presented 
the highest n -3/n-6 ratio  in winter period . The highest yearly protein content was observed for 
P. palmata and Enteromorpha  sp. with intermediate content for Gracilaria sp. and S. latissima . 
The lowest protein contents were observed for L. digitata , stipes of L. hyperborea, U. lactuca, 
and S. polyschides . An important degradation was observed after one month in the sea -structure 
for the green algae Enteromorpha sp. and  U. lactuca,  for S. pol yschides  and for Gracilaria  sp. 
In contrast, more than half of the algae distributed were still present after one month in sea -
structure for P. palmata, L. digitata and S. latissima.  
A significant seasonal effect (p  < 0.0 5) was observed for the soluble  carbohydrate contents , dry 
matter and proportion of algae degraded  (p < 0.05) but no t for protein content  (p > 0.05) . 
Apart for histidine and tryptophan, significant differences of total amino -acid compositions 
were observed between the eight algal diets (Table 4 ). The red algae P. palmata  and Gracilaria  
sp. presented the highest content for most of the  total essential amino -acid. The brown alga e L. 
digitata  and the stipes of L. hyperborea  presented most of the time the lowest total amino ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
content while the green algae and the kelp S. latissima presented intermediate contents. In 
addition, d ifferences  (p < 0.05)  were observed between the 8 algae for free amino -acid contents  
apart for methionine and valine. However, free essential amino acid contents  were variable 
depending of  the algae and the amino -acid (Table 4). 
 
3.3. Relationship between growth and algal composition  
 
The first three components of the PCA based on the abalone variables and seasonal biochemical 
composition of algae explained 66.8 % of the total variance ( 37.9 % for the first component, 
17.3 % for the second component and 11.5 % fo r the third component) (Figure 4 ). For the 
abalone variables, t he most important loadings  on the first component were the VGI (cos²  = 
0.80), GI (cos²  = 0.79), DGWseason  (cos² = 0.54), inversely related t o Sr (cos²  = 0.61). For 
the algal chemical composition, n3n6 (cos² = 0.74), prot (cos² = 0.65) and carb (cos² = 0.50) 
explained best the first axis . This component could represent the growth and reproduction 
associated with the biochemical protein, n -3/n-6 ratio and soluble carbohydrate richness of the 
algae. The most important loadings on the second component were liptot (cos² = 0.77) and 
lippoly  (cos² = 0.66). The variable  Pdegraded  (cos² = 0.49) and drymatter (cos² = 0.23) were 
the two variables with the higher loading on the third axis , but were not related with any growth 
variables . 
 
The first three components of the PCA based on the abalone variables and amino -acid 
composition explained 6 1.4 % of the total variance ( 37.5 % for the first component, 14.9 % for 
the second component and 9.1 % fo r the third component) (Figure 5 ). For the abalone variables, ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
the most important loadings on the first component were the GI (cos²  = 0.7 6), VGI (cos² = 0.75) 
associated with T_Val (cos² = 0.88), T_Met  (cos² = 0.87),  T_Leu (cos² = 0.86), T_Arg (cos² = 
0.85), and T_Ile (cos² = 0.84) . This component could represent the reproductive development 
associated with the total amino -acid composition. The most important loadings on the second 
component were F_Phe (cos² = 0.60), F_Ile (cos² = 0.54) associated with DGW season  (cos² = 
0.42). 
 
 
4. Discussion  
The high survival of abalone observed for all treatments may indicate that algal diets were 
balanced enough in term of nutrients to maintain survival although the low protein or 
carbohydrate content for L. hyperborea  stipe diet may not have been enough to sustain good 
growth.  Mortality during the one -year experiment was generally low, and not different between 
the treatments, ranging from 0.8% for S. latissima  and 1.3% for U. lactuca  treatment up to 3.3% 
and 3.5% for P. palmata , mixed diet and Gracilaria sp. diets.  
 
Good growth rates are important to reach a marketable size within a time which  is economically 
viable. H. tuberculata  is a slow -growing species with a n average  monthly growth rate between 
1 mm and 2 mm, dep ending on the farming conditions (Basuyaux, 1997 ; Lachambre, 2017 ). 
This experiment was conducted in a commercial set -up, with the same density, cage design, 
and feeding rhythm  as France Haliotis organic certified farming practices . Our study 
demonstrated that abalone fed on P. palmata , mixed diet and S. latissima  presented the best 
growth rate, muscle ratio and gonad development. Gracilaria sp., L. digitata  and Enteromorpha ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
sp. gave moderate growth performances while U. lactuca  and stipes of L. hyperborea  presented 
the lowest growth performances. Previous studies on H. tuberculata  have shown that diets 
based on P. palmata  produced better growth rates than most of the algae fo und in Europe 
(Mercer et al., 1993 ; Mai et al., 1996 ; Viera et al., 2015 ; Basuyaux et al., 2018 ). In addition, the 
high nutritional value of P. palmata  has been reported for other abalone species such as H. 
discus hannai  (Uki et al., 1986 ; Mercer et al., 1993 ). However, other experiments found 
different results for algal species such as S. latissima , which gave o ne of the best growth in our 
one-year long experiment while it presented the lowest growth performance in other 
experiments (Mercer et al., 1993 ; Mai et al., 1996 ). U. lactuca  was one of the alga l diet s that 
gave the poorer growth while it turned to be moderately good for Mercer et al. (1993 ). The 
difference of experiment duration can explain part of the difference ( 50 weeks for our 
experiment,  17 weeks  for Mai et al., 1996; and 33 weeks for Mercer et al., 1993) and probably 
results from the high variability in algal composition according to the season and site (Renaud 
and Luong -Van, 2006 ; Villares et al., 2013 ; Schmid et al., 2014 ). In addition, these experiments 
were performed in controlled conditions with stable temperature and renewal of algae every 5 -
7 days compar ed to our commercial scale experiment submitted to seasonal temperature 
change, open -seawater conditions and a month ly feed renewal. In addition to growth 
performance, the degradation of algae in the sea -cage structure is an important factor to 
integrate in the choice of a commercial structure  and varied between 33% up to 93% 
degradation over one month . P. palmata, L. digitata  and S. latissima showed the least 
degradation over one month. However, in our experiment, growth performances of abalone 
were not related to degradation of algae. Another interesting finding for commercial purpose is 
the high variability in term of m uscle  on total weight ratio (%) with more than 25% more 
muscle in abalone fed P. palmata  diet compared to Enteromorpha sp. diet. This resulted 
directly from diet treatment as the abalone individuals were from the same genetic stock. ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
In this specific context, it  puts forward the importance of measuring weight in addition to 
length, and more specifically muscle on total weight ratio.  
 
In order to reach maximum abalone growth using fresh algae, it is important to understand 
which algal component explains best growth performances. Specific growth rate  (SGR) values 
in this study (0.2 -0.7%) were similar to SGR obtained with 1 -year old H. tuberculata  fed with 
artificial diets based on different seaweeds meals (0.2 -0.3%) or fresh G. cornea  and U. rigida  
(0.56%) (Viera et al., 2015 ). If algal composition is clearly identified according to seasonal 
variation, fresh algal diets can constitute high quality and efficient feeds.  In this experiment, 
the main components related to abalone growth obtained with PCA analysis were the lipid n -
3/n-6 ratio, the soluble  carbohydrate content and total protein content. These components have 
been often reported as important in the literature. H. tuberculata  growth seemed to be highly 
correlated to n-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA ) in algal composition  as demonstrated by  
Mai et al. (1996)  with a  SGR of  1.31 % day-1 when fed a P. palmata  diet containing the highest 
amount of n -3 PUFA (49.7%  of total fatty acids ) compared to a SGR of 1.03  % day-1 when fed 
L. saccharina  diet containing the lowest n -3 PUFA (25.2%  of total fatty acids ). A lower SGR 
(0.30 % day-1) was also observed in Jade tiger hybrid abalone fed canola oil diets containing 
lower levels of n -3 PUFA  (12.5% of total fatty acids)  compared to a  higher  SGR (0.47 % day1) 
when fed fish oil diet containing more n -3 PUFA  (27.5 % of total fatty acids) (Mateos et al., 
2013 ). In our experiment, total PUFAs w ere not related to growth enhancement . However, it 
should be highlighted lipid composition was only evaluated in winter period . This might bias 
partly our PCA and under -evaluate  lipid composition  importance in cont rast to other 
biochemical algal composition evaluated at different period .  ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
High protein content is another main component explaining the good growth performance 
reached for H. tuberculata  in our experiment as observed for Mercer  et al. (1993)  and Viera  et 
al. (2015) , in H. asinina  (Bautista -Teruel and Millamena, 1999 ), H. iris and H. discus hannai  
(Shpigel et al., 1999 ). In addition, the present work was designed to compare the amino acid 
patterns of selected algae and determine which is the most related to H. tuberculata  
reproduc tion and growth variables. Amino acid composition is usually the first parameter to be 
considered in formulating test or commercial feeds , but it is also very expensive to measure . 
The determination of the limiting amino -acid is based on comparisons betwee n the absolute 
values in the flesh diet profiles (Fleming et al., 1996 ). Using an ACP anal ysis, it was observed 
that the growth variables were mainly associated with the free valine, leucine, isoleucine as well 
as phenylalanine contents. Threonine, valine, methionine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, 
tryptophan, lysine, histidine and arginin e have been validated as being essential amino -acid in 
H. rufescens  using (U -14C) glucose (Allen and Kilgore, 1975 ). In addition, free arginine, 
methionine and threonine have already been reported to be important amino -acid for 
H. tuberculata  growth (Mai et al., 1994 ). 
 
In natural conditions , abalone  consume a variety of seaweeds, trapping drift kelp or selecting 
attached benthic algae mainly according to their abundance and avaibility in the surrounding 
area, and water movement (Cornwall et al., 2009 ; Zeeman et al., 2012 ). It has been often 
reported that growth is improved when abalone are fed on a combination of macroalgae species 
in comparison to a single species diet (Mercer et al., 1993 ; Qi et al., 2010b ; Viera et al., 2015 ). 
In our experiment, mixed diet gave the second best growth performance, preceded by P. 
palmata . This result is in accordance with the meta -analysis of Lef check et al. (2013 ) performed 
on variety of taxa and systems showing that mixed diets conferred significantly higher fitness 
than the average of single -species diets, but not for the best single prey species. However, i n ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
order to prevent depletion of the algal resources , a mixed diet seems an optimal solution for 
European abalone farms, with good growth performance  as tested by Basuyaux et al. (2018) . 
 
Juveniles were about 2 -year-old when this study was conducted . At this age, an average of 90% 
of the animals presented an early stage of gonad development (1 to 10 on the Visual Gonad 
Index scale) but less than 23% of the cohort featured a full gonad development (over an 8 score 
on the Visual Gonad Index scale). These results were consistent with studies conducted in the 
natural environment in Northern Brittany where se xual maturation was observed for abalone 
between 2 and 3 -year-old with a minimum size of 30 mm necessary for reproduction (Clavier 
and Richard, 1985 ). Length and weight of individuals seemed to be the most important 
determinants of maturation in H. tuberculata . Considering that all the a balone were 18 -month -
old, and that the weight and size were similar at the beginning of the experiment between 
treatments, we could conclude that, in a maturing population, larger abalone would become 
reproductive at least a year before smaller abalone of the same age. O ur results were consistent 
with a study in the wild population of H. laevigata  (McAvaney et al., 2004) which suggested a 
significant plasticity of the maturity age in H. laevigata .  
 
Due to the small size of abalone used in our study, it was not possible t o separate the gonad and 
the digestive gland. Thus, gonad weight had been estimated using histology. This method gave 
a good proxy of the proportion of gonad on the gonad -digestive gland even if it does not give 
an exact value. Abalone fed P. palmata  and m ixed diet (yearly average; S. polyschides : 15.5 %; 
L. digitata : 20.5%; P. palmata : 43%;  S. latissima : 8%; U. lactuca : 12%) developed more gonad 
compared to abalone fed on stipes of L. hyperborea , which showed higher shell ratio.  In 
addition, visual gonad i ndex as well as  gonadal index  were related to protein content and some ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
amino -acids (total valine, leucine, isoleucine, methionine, arginine and threonine). These 
results are consistent with other studies in abalone H. iris  (Tung and Alfaro, 2012 ) and sea 
urchins Stronglyocentrotus droebachiensis (Lyons a nd Scheibling, 2007 ) where an effect of 
natural or artificial diets was demonstrated on both growth performance and gonad development 
by influ encing a shift between somatic and gonadal depots. Crude protein content of the 
seaweed seems to play an important role in H. tuberculata coccinea  reproduction, fed on 
Gracilaria cornea  with different protein levels (Bilbao et al., 2012 ).  
 
5. Conclusion  
The age of initial sexual maturity in H. tuberculata  seems to be a highly plastic trait in response 
to different growth rate and algal diet. Abalone are likely to invest more energy in muscle and 
gonad developments when fed on Palmaria palmata . According to farming strategies and 
seaweed availability in natural environment, it may be interesting to feed aba lone on some 
specific types of algae. As demonstrated in this long -term experimental, seasonal quality of 
algae differs and will impact growth differently. Mixed diets allowed a good muscle 
development  and growth results  and should probably be preferred to a monospecific diet in 
order to avoid lack of essential nutrients and high pressure on one algal resource.

Highlights of the manuscript:  
1. Mixed diets conferred significantly higher fitness than the average of single -species diets, but not for the best single P. palmata  species  
2.  Abalone are likely to invest more energy in muscle and gonad developments when fed on Palmaria palmata . 
3. At 2-year -old, an average of 90% of H. tuberculata  started gonad development but less than 23% of the cohort featured a full gonad development  
4. Soluble carbohydrate content, n -3/n-6 ratio, total protein content and phenylalanine -isoleucine free amino -acids are the major algal components  
implicated in initial gonad development and growth performance  ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
