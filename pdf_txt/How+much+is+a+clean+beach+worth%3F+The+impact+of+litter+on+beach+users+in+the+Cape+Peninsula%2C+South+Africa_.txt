Executi  ve Summary 
Marine litt  er is now present in every ocean (Cheshire et al 2009) and poses numerous 
threats to the marine environment. Marine litt  er is deﬁ  ned as “any persistent, 
manufactured or processed solid material discarded, disposed of or abandoned 
in the marine and coastal environment. Marine litt  er consists of items that 
have been made or used by people and deliberately discarded into the sea 
or rivers or on beaches; brought indirectly to the sea with rivers, sewage, 
storm water or winds; accidentally lost, including material lost at sea 
in bad weather (ﬁ  shing gear, cargo); or deliberately left   by people on 
beaches and shores.” (UNEP 2005: 3)
Although marine litt  er has received increasing att  enti  on in recent 
years, very few studies have explored the economic impact of 
marine litt  er. Therefore, the objecti  ve of this research was to 
investi  gate the economic impact of marine litt  er on coastal 
communiti  es throughout the Northeast Atlanti  c region. This 
study updates and extends the pilot project carried out by 
Hall (2000) and uses a similar methodology to examine 
how marine litt  er aﬀ  ects key industries that rely on the 
marine environment. These industries include agriculture, 
aquaculture, ﬁ  sheries, harbours, industrial seawater users, 
marinas, municipaliti  es, power stati  ons, rescue services 
and voluntary organisati  ons.
Municipaliti  es throughout the Northeast Atlanti  c region 
conti  nue to face high costs associated with the removal 
of beach litt  er. UK municipaliti  es spend approximately €18 
million each year removing beach litt  er, which represents 
a 37% increase in cost over the past 10 years. Similarly, 
removing beach litt  er costs municipaliti  es in the Netherlands 
and Belgium approximately €10.4 million per year. For most 
municipaliti  es, the potenti  al economic impact of marine litt  er 
on tourism provides the principal moti  vati  on for removing 
beach litt  er. In this respect, regularly removing beach litt  er costs 
less than the potenti  al reducti  on in revenue that could result 
from taking no acti  on. The potenti  al economic impact of marine 
litt  er also provides a more powerful incenti  ve for removing beach 
litt  er than current legislati  on, parti  cularly in the UK. 
Voluntary organisati  ons also remove a signiﬁ  cant amount of litt  er from 
beaches and the coastline throughout the Northeast Atlanti  c region. In the 
UK, for instance, each volunteer contributes the equivalent of €16.23 of their 
ti  me each year on average to removing marine litt  er. Volunteer involvement in 
2 of the largest clean up schemes in the UK, MCS Beachwatch and KSB Nati  onal 
Spring Clean, is therefore worth approximately € 131,287.47, which suggests that the 
total cost of voluntary acti  on to remove marine litt  er could be considerable. iiiEconomic Impacts  of Marine Litt  er
For many areas, the clean and unspoiled coastline is the principal att  racti  on for tourists. The organisati  ons 
surveyed during this study were clear that marine litt  er can threaten the image and reputati  on of an area potenti  ally leading to a decline in tourist numbers and revenue. With coastal tourism worth between                        
€7 billion (Tourism Alliance 2007) and €11 billion (Deloitt  e 2008) annually in the UK, this could have a 
signiﬁ  cant negati  ve impact, parti  cularly as tourism tends to make a disproporti  onately large contributi  on to coastal economies. 
Fishing vessels can also experience a variety of issues due to marine litt  er and of the Scotti   sh vessels surveyed, 
86% had experienced a restricted catch due to marine litt  er, 82% had had their catch contaminated and 95% 
had snagged their nets on debris on the seabed. Incidents such as fouled propellers and blocked intake pipes were also relati  vely common with an average of just under 1 incident reported per vessel per year. Marine litt  er therefore costs the Scotti   sh ﬁ  shing ﬂ  eet between €11.7 million and €13 million on average each year, which is the equivalent of 5% of the total revenue of aﬀ  ected ﬁ  sheries.
Marine litt  er presents fewer problems for aquaculture producers and therefore the total cost to the 
aquaculture industry was comparati  vely low at approximately €155,548.66 per year. The majority of costs for aquaculture producers relate to fouled propellers on workboats and while the individual cost of these incidents was high, the average cost of marine litt  er was relati  vely low due to the infrequent occurrence of 
these incidents.
Harbours and marinas remove marine litt  er to ensure that their faciliti  es remain clean, safe and att  racti  ve 
for users. Marine litt  er costs harbours in the UK a total of €2.4 million each year with an average cost of 
€8,034.37 per harbour, although these costs are considerably higher for larger faciliti  es and busy ﬁ  shing 
ports. While Spanish harbours experienced similar issues to the UK, the economic cost of marine litt  er was 
almost 7 ti  mes higher than in the UK. 
The informati  on provided by harbours and marinas also suggests that incidents involving vessel damage 
caused by marine litt  er are widespread with over 70% of UK harbours and marinas reporti  ng that their users 
had experienced incidents involving marine litt  er. Fouled propellers were the most common type of incident 
reported but in general, incidents only occurred occasionally. The most frequently reported cause of fouled propellers was derelict ﬁ  shing gear, which suggests that this type of marine litt  er can pose disproporti  onately high health and safety risks. 
Marine litt  er therefore conti  nues to pose a signiﬁ  cant navigati  onal hazard to vessels in the North Atlanti  c 
and while the safety of crew members is clearly the foremost concern in these situati  ons, rescue operati  ons involving the coastguard will also have ﬁ  nancial implicati  ons. The rising trend in the number of rescues to vessels with fouled propellers is therefore of parti  cular concern. In 2008, for example, there were 286 rescues to vessels with fouled propellers in UK waters at a cost of between €830,000 and €2,189,000. 
Coastal agriculture producers experience a wide range of issues due to marine litt  er including damage to 
property and machinery, harm to livestock and the cost of litt  er removal. Marine litt  er cost each croft   an average of €841.10 per year and the vast majority of these costs are incurred during the removal of marine litt  er, although harm to livestock and damage to machinery can result in high costs when these incidents occur. Overall, marine litt  er costs the agriculture industry in Shetland approximately €252,331 per year but it is unknown how marine litt  er aﬀ  ects farmers in other coastal regions.
Marine litt  er clearly aﬀ  ects a wide range of industries and a case study of the Shetland Islands, in the United ivEconomic Impacts of Marine Litt  er
Kingdom, shows how these costs can aﬀ  ect one coastal community. Overall, marine litt  er costs the Shetland 
economy between €1 million and €1.1 million on average each year. As ﬁ  shing is one of the main industries in Shetland, it bears the brunt of these costs but this is likely to vary in other coastal communiti  es where industries such as tourism may be more important and thus aﬀ  ected by marine litt  er to a larger extent. Since Shetland represents only a single case study, these ﬁ  ndings also suggest that the total economic impact of marine litt  er on coastal communiti  es in the Northeast Atlanti  c region could be extremely high.
This study also investi  gated the wider context of the impacts of marine litt  er and in parti  cular, the sensiti  vity 
and prioriti  es of various sectors as regards marine litt  er. Although organisati  ons stressed the importance of a clean and high quality environment, marine litt  er aﬀ  ects almost 66% of the organisati  ons surveyed during this project. Overall, marine litt  er aﬀ  ects these organisati  ons either by directly impacti  ng on their core acti  viti  es or through the need to remove litt  er, which requires additi  onal resources and expenditure. The majority of organisati  ons surveyed during this project also stated that absolutely no litt  er was acceptable in the marine environment, although many recognised that achieving a minimal level of marine litt  er is perhaps a more realisti  c target. These organisati  ons were therefore agreed that current levels of marine litt  er are unacceptable. 
Several general themes also emerged in this study and these were evident in virtually every industry 
surveyed. Firstly, it is clear that in the case of marine litt  er, the polluter does not pay with many organisati  ons forced to ﬁ  nd the resources and funds to deal with litt  er caused by other parti  es. Similarly, it is important to acknowledge that while many of these eﬀ  orts miti  gate the short-term impact of marine litt  er, they do not directly address the underlying marine litt  er problem. Furthermore, marine litt  er represents an additi  onal and completely unnecessary cost to these organisati  ons, many of which face increasing diﬃ   culti  es balancing service provision with limited funds. 
This research also highlights that while the economic impact of marine litt  er occurs at a local level, acti  on to 
reduce it must be global. With marine litt  er originati  ng from many diﬀ  use sources, there needs to be a step change in how the problem is treated at a nati  onal and internati  onal level. As a starti  ng point, marine litt  er needs to be regarded as a pollutant on the same level as heavy metals, chemicals and oil and therefore given the same politi  cal credibility. 
Att  enti  on also needs to be given to the way we design and treat products, parti  cularly those made of plasti  c, 
with too many currently designed for one use and then thrown away. Similarly, the enforcement of litt  er legislati  on must be improved if the sources of marine litt  er are to be signiﬁ  cantly reduced. In principle, current legislati  on does much to reduce marine litt  er but in practi  ce, stronger networks of enforcement and signiﬁ  cant ﬁ  nes are required to realise the full potenti  al of these regulati  ons.
These challenges are not new but the way we address them must be if we are to signiﬁ  cantly reduce marine 
litt  er. What is clear is that without strong acti  on to tackle the sources of marine litt  er, the costs associated with it will conti  nue to rise.vEconomic Impacts  of Marine Litt  er

1. Introducti  on
Marine litt  er is now present in every ocean (Cheshire et al 2009) and poses numerous threats to the marine 
environment. Marine litt  er is deﬁ  ned by the United Nati  ons Environment Program as: 
“any persistent, manufactured or processed solid material discarded, disposed of or abandoned in the marine and coastal environment. Marine litt  er consists of items that have been made or used by people and deliberately discarded into the sea or rivers or on beaches; brought indirectly to the sea with rivers, sewage, storm water or winds; accidentally lost, including material lost at sea in bad weather (ﬁ  shing gear, cargo); or deliberately left   by people on beaches and shores.” (UNEP 2005: 3)
Marine litt  er therefore originates from a diverse range of land- and ocean-based sources and includes 
numerous diﬀ  erent types of litt  er, although plasti  cs account for the 
majority of items (Derraik 2002).  Determining how much marine 
litt  er is present in the oceans is challenging, however, given the 
variety of ways litt  er can enter the marine environment and 
the relati  vely slow rate of degradati  on of most marine litt  er items, parti  cularly plasti  cs. Nevertheless, the amount of litt  er reaching the marine environment is signiﬁ  cant (Derraik 2002) with esti  mates suggesti  ng that there are between 13,000 and 18,000 pieces of marine litt  er per square kilometer of ocean (UNEP 2005; UNEP 2006). 
Marine litt  er can cause a wide variety of negati  ve 
environmental, social, economic and public health and safety impacts. As a result, marine litt  er has att  racted increasing att  enti  on in recent years from both policy makers and researchers. In terms of legislati  on, marine litt  er is speciﬁ  cally addressed as part of the UN Resoluti  on A/RES/60/30 – Oceans and the Law of the Sea – and under the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directi  ve (2008/56/EC). Various studies have also focused on marine litt  er and this research has generally concentrated on identi  fying the types, sources, amounts, trends and environmental impacts of marine litt  er. Very few 
studies, however, have explored the economic impacts of marine litt  er.
The main objecti  ve of this project therefore is to investi  gate the economic impact of marine litt  er on coastal communiti  es throughout the Northeast Atlanti  c region. This study updates and extends the pilot project carried out by KIMO Internati  onal in 2000, which investi  gated the ﬁ  nancial and social costs of marine litt  er (Hall 2000). Using a similar methodology to Hall (2000), this study examines how marine litt  er aﬀ  ects key industries that rely on the marine environment including:

To present the ﬁ  ndings of this research, the following structure has been adopted in this report. Chapter 
2 provides a review of existi  ng literature about the types, sources, amounts and impacts of marine litt  er. Chapter 3 outlines the key internati  onal agreements and legislati  on that directly and indirectly address the problem of marine litt  er. Chapter 4 sets out the methodology used in the project and describes the data 
collecti  on process. In chapters 5 – 13, the key ﬁ  ndings are presented for each sector involved in the project. 
These chapters explore how marine litt  er aﬀ  ects each sector, how much it costs to deal with and the types 
of litt  er preventi  on methods adopted by each sector. Chapter 14 draws together the various strands of the project into a case study of the economic impact of marine litt  er on one coastal community in the United Kingdom. The project also investi  gated the wider context of the impacts of marine litt  er and these ﬁ  ndings are presented in Chapter 15. Finally, Chapter 16 outlines the conclusions of the project.3Economic Impacts  of Marine Litt  er
2. Literature Review
Marine litt  er is one of the most pervasive polluti  on problems aﬀ  ecti  ng the marine environment and “unless 
eﬀ  ecti  ve acti  on is taken, the global marine litt  er problem will only conti  nue to worsen in the years to come” (UNEP 2009: 11). Marine litt  er originates from numerous sources and can cause a wide range of environmental, social, economic and public health and safety impacts. Research to date has focused on the types, sources, amounts, trends and environmental impacts of marine litt  er while studies into the economic impacts of marine litt  er remain relati  vely rare. Although the dynamic and diﬀ  use nature of marine litt  er makes systemati  c assessments of the problem diﬃ   cult (UNEP 2009), research is crucial to provide a strong foundati  on for confronti  ng the marine litt  er problem. 
2.1 Types of marine litt  erMarine litt  er includes a wide variety of diﬀ  erent types of debris and these can be classiﬁ  ed into several 
disti  nct categories:
plasti  cs•  including moulded, soft  , foam, nets, ropes, buoys, monoﬁ  lament line and other ﬁ  sheries 
related equipment, smoking related items such as cigarett  e butt  s or lighters, and microplasti  c parti  cles            metal•  including drink cans, aerosol cans, foil wrappers and disposable barbeques
glass•  including buoys, light globes, ﬂ  uorescent globes and bott  les
processed ti  mber•  including pallets, crates and parti  cle board
paper and cardboard • including cartons, cups and bags
rubber•  including tyres, balloons and gloves
clothing and texti  les • including shoes, furnishings and towels
sewage related debris (SRD)•  including cott  on bud sti  cks, nappies, condoms and sanitary products 
(Cheshire et al 2009; Beachwatch 2009a).
2.1.1 Plasti  cs and syntheti  c materials
Plasti  cs dominate marine litt  er and represent a signiﬁ  cant 
threat to the marine environment due to their abundance, 
longevity in the marine environment and their ability to travel vast distances. Despite representi  ng only 10% of all waste produced (Thompson et al 2009a), plasti  cs account for between 50-80% of marine litt  er (Barnes et al 2009) and this is expected to conti  nue to grow for the foreseeable future (Thompson et al 2009b). 
Plasti  cs are relati  vely cheap to produce which has led to more 
items being discarded. Since they are also lightweight and long lasti  ng, plasti  c items can travel extremely long distances and conti  nue to pose a hazard to marine life for long periods of ti  me (Laist and Liﬀ  mann 2000). Consequently plasti  cs present a long-term threat to marine ecosystems as they can directly harm wildlife (Sheavly and Register 2007), damage benthic environments (Moore 2008), transport non-nati  ve 
4Economic Impacts of Marine Litt  er
and invasive species (Cheshire et al 2009), and concentrate toxic chemicals from seawater (Committ  ee on the 
Eﬀ  ecti  veness of Internati  onal and Nati  onal Measures to Prevent and Reduce Marine Debris and Its Impacts et al 2008). A growing area of concern is the potenti  al impact of microplasti  c parti  cles, which are now abundant throughout the world’s oceans and beaches, but the environmental signiﬁ  cance of this type of polluti  on is yet to be fully understood (Thompson et al 2004).
2.2 Sources of marine litt  erMarine litt  er results from human acti  ons and behaviour, whether deliberate or accidental, and is the product 
of poor waste management, inadequate infrastructure and a lack of public knowledge about the potenti  al consequences of inappropriate waste disposal (UNEP 2009). Marine litt  er therefore originates from numerous diﬀ  erent sources with approximately 80% of litt  er entering the marine environment from land-based sources and the remaining 20% originati  ng from ocean-based sources (GESAMP 1991), although this varies between areas (Allsopp et al 2006). 
2.2.1 Land-based sources of marine litt  erMarine litt  er can be generated on land in coastal areas including beaches, piers, harbours, marinas and 
docks (Allsopp et al 2006) as well as many kilometers inland, due to the long distances litt  er can travel in the environment (Ten Brink et al 2009). Litt  er is both intenti  onally and inadvertently discharged into the environment and can result from a wide range of acti  viti  es including coastal tourism, ﬂ  y-ti  pping, local businesses and poorly managed waste disposal sites (Allsopp et al 2006; UNEP 2009).
Land-based sources of marine litt  er include (Allsopp et al 2006):
Public litt  ering•  – A wide variety of litt  er items are discarded, either intenti  onally or accidentally, by the 
public at the beach, coast or into rivers resulti  ng in their introducti  on into the marine environment. Tourist 
and recreati  onal visitors are a key source of litt  er with public litt  ering accounti  ng for 42% of all debris found during the 2009 UK Beachwatch survey (Beachwatch 2009b). Poor waste management practi  ces•  – Poor waste 
management practi  ces can result in debris from waste collecti  on, transportati  on and disposal sites entering the marine environment. Although litt  er can originate many kilometers inland, poorly managed coastal and riverine landﬁ  ll sites, and ﬂ  y ti  pping are key concerns.Industrial acti  viti  es • – Industrial products can be 
introduced into the marine environment when they are either poorly disposed of or accidentally lost during transport, both on land and at sea. Small plasti  c resin pellets, the feedstock for plasti  c producti  on, are a widely recognised example of this and are regularly found during marine litt  er monitoring surveys. Sewage related debris (SRD)•  – Sewage related debris 
results from the discharge of untreated sewage into the marine environment, either due to a lack of waste treatment faciliti  es or from combined sewer overﬂ  ows 
Figure 2.1 Small plasti  c resin pellets. Image: Dr Jan 
van Franeker, IMARES.5Economic Impacts  of Marine Litt  er
during storm events. SRD consti  tutes a small proporti  on of the overall litt  er problem, accounti  ng for only 
5.4% of marine litt  er found during the 2009 UK Beachwatch survey (Beachwatch 2009a), but it can be parti  cularly oﬀ  ensive in nature (ENCAMS 2007).
Storm water discharges•  – Litt  er can collect in storm drains and subsequently be discharged into the 
marine environment during storm events.
2.2.2. Ocean-based sources of marine litt  er
Ocean-based sources of marine litt  er include shipping, the ﬁ  shing industry and oﬀ  shore oil/gas installati  ons. 
Ocean-based litt  er enters the environment through both accidental and deliberate discharges of items ranging from galley waste to cargo containers (Allsopp et al 2006). 
Ocean-based litt  er is generated by (Allsopp et al 2006):
The ﬁ  shing industry•  – Nets, ropes and other ﬁ  shing debris are among the most visible elements 
of marine litt  er and result from a failure to remove gear, accidental loss of gear or the deliberate 
dumping of nets, ropes and other waste by ﬁ  shing crews. Shipping•  – Despite internati  onal legislati  on prohibiti  ng the disposal of manufactured items at sea, 
these conti  nue to be accidentally released, stored inappropriately or discarded deliberately by shipping vessels, parti  cularly on long journeys. A key concern is the frequent loss of cargo containers from commercial shipping with up to 10,000 of these containers lost worldwide each year (Podsada 2001). The leisure industry • – Recreati  onal boat owners and operators may accidentally or deliberately 
discharge waste and other manufactured items into the marine environment. Such litt  er can include food containers, plasti  c bott  les and recreati  onal ﬁ  shing gear (Sheavly 2005).Oﬀ  shore oil and gas platf  orm explorati  on•  – Oﬀ  shore oil and gas acti  viti  es can result in the release, 
both accidental and deliberate, of a wide variety of items into the marine environment. These include everyday items such as gloves and hard hats as well as waste generated from explorati  on and resource extracti  on. 
2.3 Amount and persistence of marine litt  er
2.3.1 Amount of marine litt  erWhile it is clearly evident that marine litt  er is now present in every ocean (Cheshire et al 2009), establishing 
the amount of litt  er in the oceans is extremely diﬃ   cult (Allsopp et al 2006).  Quanti  fying the amount of marine litt  er in the oceans has thus far been approached in three main ways: esti  mati  ng the amounts of litt  er already in the ocean, determining how much is added each year and through marine litt  er monitoring surveys.
2.3.1.1 Amount of marine litt  er already in the oceanGlobal esti  mates of marine litt  er levels are inherently complex and reliable esti  mates are thus relati  vely 
rare. In 2005, UNEP esti  mated that on average there are 13,000 pieces of marine litt  er per square kilometre (UNEP 2005) but a separate UNEP report a year later suggested that there are 46,000 pieces of marine litt  er per square mile (approximately 18,000 per square kilometre) (UNEP 2006). Although these ﬁ  gures must be regarded with a degree of cauti  on since no data was provided to support these esti  mates, the amount of marine litt  er reaching the oceans is undoubtedly ”substanti  al” (Derraik 2002: 843).6Economic Impacts of Marine Litt  er
2.3.1.2 Yearly increases in marine litt  er
Various att  empts have been made, both at a global and regional scale, to esti  mate how much litt  er enters 
the marine environment every year. Globally, esti  mates suggest approximately 6.4 million tonnes of litt  er 
enter the oceans each year (US Nati  onal Academy of Science 1975 cited in Cheshire et al 2009), although this ﬁ  gure is now somewhat outdated. In the early 1980s, it was esti  mated that up to 8 million items of marine litt  er enter the oceans daily (Horsman 1982) but this ﬁ  gure now needs to be updated and multi  plied several 
fold (Barnes 2005). At a regional level, the OSPAR Commission suggested that approximately 20,000 tonnes 
of marine litt  er enters the North Sea each year (OSPAR 1995), although no sources were provided to support 
this esti  mate. Despite variable overall esti  mates, however, it is widely accepted that both the levels of marine litt  er and the rate of input into the oceans are rising (Barnes 2002; Derraik 2002).
2.3.1.3 Marine litt  er monitoring
Marine litt  er monitoring programmes are currently carried out in a number of diﬀ  erent countries throughout 
the world but diﬀ  erences in study design, methodology and purpose makes comparison between monitoring programmes challenging (Cheshire et al 2009). Approximately 70% of marine litt  er sinks to the seabed, 15% ﬂ  oats in the water column and 15% washes up on shore (OSPAR 1995), and diﬀ  erent methods of assessment are required to investi  gate each of these litt  er sinks. Generally, these programmes aim to establish long-term data sets from which it is then possible to interpret trends in the compositi  on and abundance of litt  er over ti  me.
2.3.1.3.1 Amounts found on the coastlineBeach litt  er surveys are the most common type of monitoring programme and are frequently undertaken 
with the help of volunteers. On a global scale, the Ocean Conservancy co-ordinate the Internati  onal Coastal Clean-up (ICC), where volunteers from across the globe conduct litt  er surveys on one day in September. Volunteers in 2009 collected 10.24 million items of debris in 108 diﬀ  erent countries with the top 3 items – cigarett  e butt  s, plasti  c bags and food containers – accounti  ng for over 40% of the debris collected (ICC 2010). Between 2001and 2006, the Ocean Conservancy also conducted a project on behalf of the U.S. Environmental Protecti  on Agency to establish baseline data about the extent of the marine litt  er problem in the U.S. Using over 600 volunteers, the project monitored ‘indicator’ items of litt  er over the ﬁ  ve year period in 21 diﬀ  erent states. While there were wide variati  ons in the number of litt  er items reported at each locati  on, an average of 96 litt  er items were removed per survey with only Hawaii reporti  ng an appreciable decrease in litt  er levels over the course of the study (Sheavly 2007).
In the OSPAR region, a pilot study published in 2007 found an average of 542 items of marine litt  er of various 
sizes per 100-metre survey on the reference beaches. Surveys were also made on 1-km stretches for larger items (>50cm in any directi  on) and on average 67 marine litt  er items were recorded per kilometre. The total number of marine litt  er items found per survey varied considerably between regions with, on average, signiﬁ  cantly higher levels occurring on beaches in the northern regions (Northern North Sea and the Celti  c Seas) than on the beaches on the Iberian coast and in the Southern North Sea. The overall amount of marine litt  er in the North Atlanti  c remains consistently high with no stati  sti  cally signiﬁ  cant increase or decrease in the average number of items recorded (OSPAR 2009).
Beach monitoring surveys are also oft  en conducted at a nati  onal level. In the UK, the Marine Conservati  on 
Society co-ordinates Beachwatch, a volunteer monitoring programme which has been running since 1994. 7Economic Impacts  of Marine Litt  er
On average, 1,849 items were found 
per km of beach surveyed in 2009, although this was highly variable 
between regions with South West 
England recording the highest levels. Overall, the 2009 results represent a 77% increase in litt  er since the ﬁ  rst Beachwatch survey in 1994 when 1,045 items/km were recorded. Plasti  cs have consistently accounted for over 50% of litt  er recorded in all Beachwatch surveys and the 2009 survey recorded the highest percentage of plasti  cs to date at 63.5% (Beachwatch 2009a).
2.3.1.3.2 Amounts found at seaWith 70% of litt  er sinking to the seabed 
and 15% ﬂ  oati  ng in the water column (OSPAR 1995), the vast majority of marine litt  er is found at sea but comparati  vely few studies have investi  gated the abundance of marine litt  er at sea. In terms of litt  er on the seabed, a study by Galgani et al (2000) used trawl nets to investi  gate the density of marine litt  er on the seaﬂ  oor along European Coasts. Densiti  es were subject to signiﬁ  cant geographical variati  on and ranged from 0 to 101,000 pieces of litt  er per km². Plasti  cs, parti  cularly bags and bott  les, accounted for more than 70% of litt  er collected at most stati  ons with accumulati  ons of speciﬁ  c debris such as ﬁ  shing gear also frequently encountered. The mean density of debris for each area was 126 items/km² in the Balti  c Sea; 156 items/km² in the North Sea; 528 items/km² in the Celti  c Sea; 142 items/km² in the Bay of Biscay; 143 items/km² in the Gulf of Lion; 1935 items/km² in the North-Western Mediterranean; 229 items/km² in East Corsica; and 378 items/km² in the Adriati  c Sea (Galgani et al 2000).
A number of diﬀ  erent methods exist for monitoring the amounts of marine litt  er ﬂ  oati  ng in the oceans 
including visual surveys and the use of biological monitoring tools. In 2002, a study of ﬂ  oati  ng litt  er in the North Atlanti  c was conducted using visual sighti  ngs of litt  er on the ocean surface from a ship. Densiti  es ranged between 0 to 20 litt  er items per square km in lati  tudes between 0-50°N with the highest densiti  es occurring around the UK and North-Western Europe. Densiti  es of litt  er ﬂ  oati  ng in the English Channel, for example, were as high as over 100 items/km² (Barnes and Milner 2005).
A key source of informati  on about the amounts and trends of litt  er in the North Atlanti  c is an ongoing 
OSPAR project that uses fulmars as a marine litt  er monitoring tool. North Sea Ministers adopted a system of ‘Ecological Quality Objecti  ves for the North Sea’ (EcoQOs) in 2002 as a means to measure human impacts on the North Sea environment. One of the EcoQOs speciﬁ  ed in the Ministerial Declarati  on focused on the use of seabirds to monitor litt  er levels in the North Sea and delegated the implementati  on of the EcoQO to OSPAR. Fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis ) were identi  ﬁ  ed as a robust tool for measuring the abundance and distributi  on of 
marine litt  er as they frequently mistake plasti  c parti  cles for food and feed exclusively at sea. 
The results of the 2002 to 2004 pilot project found that in the North Sea area 95% of beachwashed Fulmars 
Figure 2.2: Volunteers parti  cipati  ng in the Marine Conservati  on Society’s    
Beachwatch scheme. Image: © Jacki Clark, MCS.8Economic Impacts of Marine Litt  er
have plasti  c in their stomachs with an average mass of 0.33 grams and an average of over 40 pieces per bird. 
Regional variati  ons within this were considerable with the southeastern North Sea four ti  mes more polluted than the seas around the Faroe Islands. These geographical diﬀ  erences suggest that marine litt  er in the North Sea is largely determined by local sources of polluti  on as all study regions are subject to the same background levels of marine litt  er arriving on the Gulf Stream (Van Franeker et al 2005). In terms of appreciable trends in marine litt  er, a background study for the EcoQO found that there was a reducti  on in the amount of litt  er at sea during the late 1990s, with the average amount of plasti  c per bird falling from 0.5g to 0.3g, but this trend has since stagnated and there has been no signiﬁ  cant reducti  on in recent years (OSPAR 2009).
Studies have also been undertaken investi  gati  ng the extent and abundance of microplasti  c parti  cles at sea. 
Research by Thompson et al (2004) has shown that microscopic plasti  c parti  cles and ﬁ  bres are present throughout the oceans and have collected both in pelagic zones and sedimentary habitats. This research also examined long-term trends in the abundance of microplasti  cs and found that levels had signiﬁ  cantly risen over the past 40 years. While marine organisms have been shown to ingest microplasti  c parti  cles, research into the full biological and environmental implicati  ons of this is sti  ll in its early stages. 
2.3.2 Persistence of marine litt  erThe persistence of many types of litt  er in the marine environment, parti  cularly glass and plasti  cs, is widely 
accepted (Cheshire et al 2009) but diﬀ  ering interpretati  ons of when ‘degradati  on’ occurs mean that esti  mates of breakdown rates vary widely. The breakdown process occurs in stages ranging from initi  al embritt  lement to fragmentati  on and the eventual chemical decompositi  on of litt  er items. Diﬀ  erent studies, however, pinpoint diﬀ  erent stages of this process as when ‘degradati  on’ occurs resulti  ng in the range of esti  mates of breakdown rates. Plasti  cs illustrate this well as they fragment to microplasti  cs over ti  mescales of hundreds of years but the length of ti  me required for their full chemical decompositi  on is unknown (Andrady 2005) and they “may never truly biodegrade” (DEFRA 2010: 78) In practi  ce, degradati  on rates can also vary substanti  ally due to varying UV levels, temperatures, oxygen levels, wave energy and the presence of abrasive factors such as sand or gravel (Cheshire et al 2009). Guideline esti  mates of degradati  on rates are shown in Table 2.1 below.

2.4 The impacts of marine litt  er
Litt  er in the marine environment gives rise to a wide range of negati  ve environmental, social, economic 
and public health and safety impacts. While these impacts are diverse, they are oft  en also interrelated and 
frequently dependent upon one another (Ten Brink et al 2009). Ghost ﬁ  shing, for example, can result in harm to the environment, economic losses to ﬁ  sheries and reduced opportuniti  es for recreati  onal ﬁ  shing (Macfadyen et al 2009). Our understanding of these impacts is variable and limited in areas, parti  cularly as regards the socio-economic eﬀ  ects of marine litt  er.
2.4.1. Environmental impacts of marine litt  erMarine litt  er can cause a wide variety of adverse environmental impacts to individual organisms, species 
and ecosystems. Ingesti  on and entanglement of wildlife are among the most well known impacts of marine 
litt  er (Gregory 2009; Thompson et al 2009) and have now been recorded in over 267 species (Laist 1997). 
This includes 86% of all sea turtle species, 44% of all seabird species and 43% of all marine mammal species 
as well as numerous ﬁ  sh and crustacean species (Allsopp et al 2006). Marine litt  er can also cause damage 
to benthic environments (Moore 2008), aﬀ  ect biodiversity (Derraik 2002) and potenti  ally lead to the loss of 
ecosystem functi  ons (Ten Brink 2009).
2.4.1.1 Ingesti  onThe ingesti  on of marine litt  er has been reported to date in over 111 species of seabird (Allsopp et al 2006), 31 
marine mammal species (Allsopp et al 2006) and 26 species of cetaceans (Derraik 2002). The main impacts of ingesti  on include:
Physical damage to the digesti  ve tract including wounds, scarring and ulcerati  on which can lead to • 
infecti  on, starvati  on and potenti  ally deathMechanical blockage of the digesti  ve tract • 
Reduced quality of life and reproducti  ve capacity• 
Drowning and reduced ability to avoid predators• 
Reduced feeding capacity and malnutriti  on• 
A false sense of sati  ati  on leading to general • 
debilitati  on, starvati  on and possibly deathToxic chemical poisoning from • 
contaminated plasti  cs leading to reproducti  ve disorders, increased risk of diseases, altered hormone levels and possibly death (Derraik 2002; Gregory 
2009; OSPAR 2009)
Establishing the full extent of the problem is very 
diﬃ   cult and the Fulmar monitoring program in the North Atlanti  c developed by OSPAR remains one of the few projects to examine the extent of ingesti  on within a species. Over the whole North 
Sea, 95% of birds examined had ingested plasti  c 
with an average of 40 pieces and 0.33 grams 
Figure 2.3: The average quanti  ty of marine litt  er inside a fulmar’s 
stomach.  On the left   is the average quanti  ty of litt  er permanently held within a fulmar’s stomach and on the right is the equivalent volume of plasti  c if it were in a human’s stomach. Image: Dr Jan van Franeker, IMARES.10Economic Impacts of Marine Litt  er
found per bird (Van Franeker et al 2005). Typically, 
evidence of ingesti  on is more commonly reported on a case-by-case basis such as the discovery by 
American scienti  sts of a dead sperm whale with just under 200kg of ﬁ  shing gear in its stomach (ICC 2009). In the UK, the post-mortem of a large adult grey seal revealed it had swallowed a plasti  c 
sea angling line splitt  er, which had lacerated the 
seal’s gut, and prevented it from feeding (OSPAR 
2009). 
2.4.1.2 Entanglement
Entanglement in nets, ropes and other debris 
poses a signiﬁ  cant risk to marine animals and has 
been recorded in over 130 species of marine animals 
including 6 sea turtle species, 51 seabird species and 32 marine mammal species (Ten Brink 2009). The main 
eﬀ  ects of entanglement include:
External cuts and wounds which can lead to infecti  on, ulcerati  on and possibly death• 
Suﬀ  ocati  on, strangulati  on and drowning of air-breathing species• 
Asphyxiati  on of ﬁ  sh species that require constant moti  on for respirati  on• 
Impaired mobility and reduced predator avoidance• 
Reduced ﬁ  tness and increased energy cost of travel due to entangled debris• 
Reduced ability to hunt for food• 
Restricted growth and preventi  on of circulati  on to limbs (Derraik 2002; Gregory 2009)• 
While entanglement is more likely than ingesti  on to cause death (Laist and Liﬀ  mann 2000), esti  mati  ng the frequency of entanglement is challenging given that many casualti  es are likely to go unrecorded as they either sink to the ocean ﬂ  oor or are eaten by predators (Derraik 2002). Overall, entanglement is esti  mated to cause the deaths of over 100,000 marine mammals each year in the North Paciﬁ  c (Moore 2008) and the limited data available suggests rates of entanglement are increasing (Thompson et al 2009b). 
Oft  en evidence of entanglement is reported anecdotally and tends to relate to individual species.  The 
Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust, for example, reported that 21% of minke whales stranded in Scotland between 1992 and 2000 had died due to entanglement (OSPAR 2009) and a study of northern fur seals in the Bering sea suggested that up to 40,000 seals are killed every year by entanglement in plasti  c (Derraik 2002). There are also parti  cular concerns that entanglement can hamper the recovery of endangered species such as Australian sea lions (Allsopp et al 2006), Hawaiian monk seals (Derraik 2002) and North Atlanti  c right whales (Ocean Conservancy 2008a).  
2.4.1.3 Ghost ﬁ  shingDerelict ﬁ  shing gear, including nets, traps and pots, can conti  nue to ‘ghost ﬁ  sh’ for long periods of ti  me 
aft  er its abandonment in the marine environment. The catching eﬃ   ciency of ghost ﬁ  shing gear is highly dependent on environmental conditi  ons but a single net has been shown to conti  nue ﬁ  shing for decades. The indiscriminate nature of ghost ﬁ  shing means that this aﬀ  ects a diverse range of species including seabirds, 
Figure 2.4: Entangled seal at Gweek Seal Sanctuary in Cornwall.   
Image:  Caroline Curti  s.11Economic Impacts  of Marine Litt  er
seals and cetaceans as well as both commercially important and non-target ﬁ  sh species (Macfadyen et al 
2009). A key concern is the impact this could be having on already vulnerable species such as North Atlanti  c deepwater sharks (Allsopp et al 2006) and Hawaiian monk seals (Derraik 2002). Commercial ﬁ  shing interests are also likely to be aﬀ  ected as ghost ﬁ  shing nets may capture immature ﬁ  sh and thus reduce the reproducti  ve potenti  al of ﬁ  sh stocks as a whole (Williams et al 2005).
Ghost ﬁ  shing can therefore act as direct competi  ti  on to commercial ﬁ  sheries (Macfadyen et al 2009) and 
could have parti  cularly detrimental eﬀ  ects on the conservati  on of vulnerable ﬁ  sh stocks (Sheavly and Register 2007). On the whole, ghost ﬁ  shing catches are likely to be low compared to commercial ﬁ  shing eﬀ  orts (Brown et al 2005). For example, ghost ﬁ  shing is not believed to account for more than 5% of commercial EU landings for gillnet and tangle ﬁ  sheries (Committ  ee on the Eﬀ  ecti  veness of Internati  onal and Nati  onal Measures to Prevent and Reduce Marine Debris and Its Impacts et al 2008) and less than 1.5% of commercial landings of monkﬁ  sh in the Cantabrian sea (Brown et al 2005). The impact of ghost nets on other species tends to be reported anecdotally but esti  mates suggest that approximately 130,000 cetaceans are killed each year by ghost ﬁ  shing gear (USEPA 1992 cited in Ten Brink 2009) and in the North East paciﬁ  c, 15% of the mortality of young fur seals ( Callorhinus usrinus ) was att  ributed to ghost ﬁ  shing (Ten Brink 2009).
2.4.1.4 Harm to benthic organisms and habitats
While approximately 70% of marine litt  er is thought to accumulate on the seaﬂ  oor (OSPAR 1995), very few 
studies to date have investi  gated the considerable threat this poses to benthic organisms and habitats. Accumulati  ons of litt  er can prevent gas exchange between overlying waters and the pore waters of sediment leading to reduced oxygen in sediments. This can result in adverse impacts on ecosystem functi  oning, smothering of benthic organisms and changes to the compositi  on of biota on the seaﬂ  oor (Derraik 2002). Marine litt  er can also cause physical damage to benthic habitats through abrasion, scouring, breaking and smothering (Sheavly and Register 2007) while derelict ﬁ  shing gear in parti  cular can “pluck” organisms and translocate sea-bed features (Macfadyen et al 2009). Benthic organisms are also at risk from entanglement and ingesti  on of marine litt  er (Derraik 2002).
2.4.1.5 Transport of non-nati  ve and invasive speciesNatural debris ﬂ  oati  ng in the oceans has always acted as a means of travel for non-nati  ve species but the 
proliferati  on of marine litt  er, parti  cularly plasti  cs, has radically increased the prospects for dispersal of non-nati  ve and potenti  ally invasive species (Gregory 2009). The slow travel rates of marine litt  er also provide non-nati  ve species with more ti  me to adjust to changing environmental conditi  ons (Moore 2008) and as a consequence, marine litt  er may be a more eﬀ  ecti  ve vector for the transport of non-nati  ve species than ships hulls and ballast water (Moore 2008). Overall, marine litt  er is esti  mated to have doubled the opportuniti  es for marine organisms to travel at tropical lati  tudes and more than tripled it at high (>50°) lati  tudes (Allsopp et al 2006 ). 
Although marine litt  er can be colonised by a diverse range of species (Gregory 2009), some of the most 
common hitchhikers include barnacles, bryozoans and polychaete worms (Allsopp et al 2006). The invasive and exoti  c acorn barnacle (Eliminius modestus), for example, has been found on plasti  c on the shoreline of the Shetland Islands (Barnes and Milner 2005) and plasti  c debris has also been implicated in the northward range extension of the large barnacle Perforatus perforatus (Rees and Southward 2008 cited in Moore 2008).
The introducti  on of invasive non-nati  ve species can have devastati  ng environmental eﬀ  ects including loss of 12Economic Impacts of Marine Litt  er
biodiversity, changes to habitat structure and changes to ecosystem functi  ons (Derraik 2002; Donnan 2009). 
Invasive species can also out compete nati  ve species as well as impact upon trophic structures and cause geneti  c changes (Donnan 2009). As a consequence, invasive species have been recognised as one of the greatest threats to global biodiversity (Barnes and Milner 2005) and pose parti  cular dangers for previously inaccessibly conservati  on islands (Derraik 2002). 
2.4.1.6 Loss of biodiversityMarine litt  er can act as an additi  onal pressure on already vulnerable species and threaten their conti  nued 
survival (Allsopp et al 2006; Derraik 2002.). The injury and death of individual animals from entanglement and ingesti  on of marine litt  er, in parti  cular, can have profound implicati  ons for the survival of an endangered species but to date very litt  le research has investi  gated the populati  on-level eﬀ  ects of marine litt  er (Laist and Liﬀ  mann 2000). For the Hawaiian monk seal (Monachus schauinslandi ), which numbers just 1,200 in the 
wild today, entanglement in marine litt  er “is arguably the most signiﬁ  cant documented impediment to the species’ recovery” (Committ  ee on the Eﬀ  ecti  veness of Internati  onal and Nati  onal Measures to Prevent and Reduce Marine Debris and Its Impacts et al 2008: 36). 
Similarly, only 300 - 350 North Atlanti  c right whales (Eubalaena glacialis ) are left   in the wild and entanglement 
accounts for a high proporti  on of right whale mortality rates (Ocean Conservancy 2008a). A total of 24 North 
Atlanti  c right whales were injured or died due to entanglement in marine litt  er between 1999 and 2008 (Ocean Conservancy 2008b). A further 6 endangered species have been classiﬁ  ed by the Australian Government as adversely aﬀ  ected by marine litt  er and these species include loggerhead turtles, blue whales and 2 species of albatross (Australian Government 2009). The loss of habitat and reduced ecosystem functi  ons resulti  ng from physical damage and smothering of benthic environments can also “alter the make-up of life on the sea ﬂ  oor” (Derraik 2002: 844). As outlined above, marine litt  er can also act as a vector for the transportati  on of invasive alien species and this can have devastati  ng consequences for biodiversity in host habitats (Derraik 2002). 
2.4.1.7 Microplasti  csWhile it is widely accepted that microplasti  cs are an 
important threat to the marine environment, their full environmental implicati  ons are not yet understood (Thompson et al 2009b). Microplasti  cs are either derived from the breakdown of larger litt  er items or enter the oceans directly from their applicati  on as ‘scrubbers’ in commercial acti  viti  es such as cleansing and air blasti  ng (Derraik 2002; Thompson et al 2009b). The abundance of microplasti  cs has increased over the past 40 years and given the longevity of plasti  cs in the marine environment, it is expected that the abundance of microplasti  cs will conti  nue to increase in future (Thompson et al 2004).  
Microplasti  cs pose a parti  cular threat to the marine environment as they are extremely diﬃ   cult to remove 
and can “be ingested by a much wider range of organisms than larger items of debris” (Barnes et al 2009: 1994). Although the full environmental impacts of microplasti  cs are not yet known (Thompson et al 2009b), 
Figure 2.5 Microplasti  cs collected using trawling equipment.  
Image: Dr Frederik Norén.13Economic Impacts  of Marine Litt  er
a key concern is the ability of plasti  cs to concentrate persistent organic pollutants such as PCBs, DDE and 
nonylphenols (Moore 2008) and potenti  ally transfer these to living organisms and the food chain (Committ  ee on the Eﬀ  ecti  veness of Internati  onal and Nati  onal Measures to Prevent and Reduce Marine Debris and Its 
Impacts et al 2008; DEFRA 2010). Microplasti  cs in parti  cular provide “a likely route for the transfer of these 
chemicals because they have a much greater surface area to volume rati  o than larger items of debris…and 
because of their size they are available to a wide range of organisms (Barnes et al 2009: 1995). To date, 
marine organisms have been proven to ingest microplasti  c fragments but whether this represents a pathway 
for the transport of these pollutants to the food chain is currently unknown (Thompson et al 2009b).
2.4.1.8 Long-term ecosystem deteriorati  onEstablishing the long-term eﬀ  ects of marine litt  er on the environment is very challenging due to the wide 
range of uncertainti  es involved (Hyrenbach and Kennish 2008). Currently, it is unclear how and to what 
extent the diverse environmental impacts of marine litt  er such as entanglement, ingesti  on, damage to benthic 
environments and loss of biodiversity will combine and interact to cause ecosystem deteriorati  on. 
Marine litt  er also acts as an additi  onal pressure on oceans already under stress from over ﬁ  shing, coastal 
development, climate change and other forms of anthropogenic disturbance (Derraik 2002). Together these 
pressures may combine to cause rapid ecosystem deteriorati  on and reduce the resilience of the oceans to 
withstand and adjust to large perturbati  ons (ICC 2009). Marine litt  er is thereby in eﬀ  ect “one of the straws that together could break the camel’s back – in this case, the ocean’s health” (ICC 2009: 19). 
2.4.2 Social impacts of marine litt  er
The social impacts of marine litt  er are rooted in the ways in which marine litt  er aﬀ  ects people’s quality of life 
and include reduced recreati  onal opportuniti  es, loss of aestheti  c value and loss of non-use value (Cheshire 
et al 2009). Few studies to date have investi  gated these issues and establishing exactly how and at what level 
marine litt  er starts to have an appreciable social impact therefore requires more research (Cheshire et al 
2009).
2.4.2.1 Reduced recreati  onal opportuniti  es
Beaches, coasts and seas are used for countless diﬀ  erent recreati  onal acti  viti  es including swimming, diving, 
boati  ng, recreati  onal ﬁ  shing and a wide variety of water sports. Accumulati  ons of marine litt  er can have a 
strong deterrent eﬀ  ect and discourage recreati  onal users from visiti  ng polluted areas (Ballance et al 2000; 
Sheavly and Register 2005). The level of litt  er required to acti  vely deter people from visiti  ng certain areas is 
clearly highly subjecti  ve depending on personal preference, purpose of acti  vity and litt  er levels in surrounding 
areas but very litt  le research into how marine litt  er acts as a deterrent to marine recreati  onal users has been undertaken to date.
Beach users, for instance, frequently rank cleanliness as their top priority when choosing where to visit 
(Ballance et al 2000; ENCAMS 2005). A pioneering South African study found that 85% of tourists and residents 
would not visit a beach with more than 2 debris items per metre and 97% would not go to a beach with 10 or more large items of litt  er per metre (Ballance et al 2000). Marine litt  er also deters other recreati  onal users 
such as sailors and divers (Sheavly and Register 2007) due to both the reduced aestheti  c quality of an area 
and concerns about the health and safety risks posed by accumulati  ons of marine litt  er (Cheshire et al 2009). 
More research is required to determine the approximate levels at which marine litt  er aﬀ  ects recreati  onal use 14Economic Impacts of Marine Litt  er
of the coastline, beaches and seas.
2.4.2.2 Loss of aestheti  c valueMarine litt  er can negati  vely aﬀ  ect people’s 
quality of life by reducing their enjoyment of the landscape and scenery (Cheshire et al 2009). The loss of visual amenity can have signiﬁ  cant eﬀ  ects on people’s recreati  onal use of the marine environment, as outlined above, but it can also simply be about the loss of a previously beauti  ful view. The marine environment is oft  en the focus of many of the creati  ve arts including painti  ngs, literature and ﬁ  lms and a loss of aestheti  cs could also negati  vely aﬀ  ect the inspirati  onal quality of the marine environment (Naturvårdsverket 2009).
2.4.2.3 Loss of non-use valueNon-use value relates to the beneﬁ  ts 
generated by knowing that a parti  cular ecosystem in maintained. There are 3 main categories of non-use value, which are existence value, bequest value and altruisti  c value, although these may overlap to some degree. Marine litt  er therefore threatens the non-use value derived from the “knowledge of the existence of desirable coastal environment, the value derived from being able to bequest unimpaired resources to future generati  ons, the altruisti  c beneﬁ  ts of preserving att  racti  ve coastal resources for other users, and the value associated with the belief that maintaining a litt  er-free coast and ocean is intrinsically desirable” (Committ  ee on the Eﬀ  ecti  veness of Internati  onal and Nati  onal Measures to Prevent and Reduce Marine Debris and Its Impacts et al 2008: 40).
2.4.3 Public health and safety impactsMarine litt  er presents a number of public health and safety concerns including navigati  onal hazards (Macfadyen 
et al 2009), injuries to recreati  onal users (Cheshire et al 2009) and the risks associated with the leaching of poisonous chemicals (Thompson et al 2009b). However, establishing the extent and frequency of incidents involving marine litt  er is very diﬃ   cult as most incidents, both in terms of vessel damage and injuries, go unrecorded (Laist and Liﬀ  mann 2000; Sheavly 2005). More research is therefore required to assess the risks posed by marine litt  er to public health and safety.
2.4.3.1 Navigati  onal hazardsMarine litt  er can present numerous diﬀ  erent safety risks for vessels but entanglement in derelict ﬁ  shing gear 
such as nets, ropes and lines presents a key concern. Plasti  c bags are also a common cause of blocked water 
15Economic Impacts  of Marine Litt  er
intakes, resulti  ng in burnt out water pumps 
in recreati  onal vessels (Sheavly and Register 2007). The main risks to navigati  on from 
marine litt  er, parti  cularly derelict ﬁ  shing 
gear, include:
Fouling and entanglement of a vessel’s • 
propeller, which can reduce both its stability 
in the water and ability to manoeuvre. This 
puts vessel crews in danger, parti  cularly during poor weather conditi  ons
Benthic and subsurface debris can foul • 
anchors and equipment deployed from 
trawlers and research vessels, endangering 
both the vessel and its crew
Collisions with marine litt  er can damage • a vessel’s propeller shaft   seal
Incidents may require divers to clear • the debris and depending on the sea state, working in close proximity to the vessel’s 
hull may be highly risky (Macfadyen et al 
2009)
Oft  en evidence of incidents endangering 
vessels’ safety is anecdotal and the majority 
of incidents go unreported. In 2005, a Russian 
submarine became entangled in derelict ﬁ  shing nets 
600 ft   below the surface oﬀ   the Kamchatka Peninsula and was trapped on the seabed for 4 days unti  l an internati  onal rescue eﬀ  ort managed to cut it free (Allsopp et al 2006; Chivers and Drew 2005). A passenger ferry travelling oﬀ   the west coast of Korea in 1993 became entangled in 10mm nylon rope, which coiled around both propeller shaft  s and the right propeller, causing the vessel to suddenly turn, capsize and sink with the loss of 292 of the 362 passengers (Cho 2004 cited in Macfadyen et al 2009). These examples demonstrate that marine litt  er poses navigati  onal hazards to all kinds of vessels and can result in extremely serious consequences, including loss of life.
2.4.3.2 Hazards to swimmers and diversEntanglement in marine litt  er, parti  cularly nets, ropes, lines and other discarded ﬁ  shing gear, presents 
serious hazards for swimmers and divers as well as wildlife and vessels (Cheshire et al 2009). Poor visibility and colonizati  on of debris by marine organisms may camouﬂ  age debris and once entangled, swimmers and divers may ﬁ  nd it diﬃ   cult to free themselves and/or seek help (Cheshire et al 2009). In January 2009, an experienced diver became entangled in ﬁ  shing net in Plymouth Sound, oﬀ   the south coast of England. It took the diver almost 20 minutes to free himself and further inspecti  on revealed the net to be 50m long and at least 2m in height with a seal pup already entangled within it. This incident occurred within an area where the use of ﬁ  shing nets is banned suggesti  ng the net had potenti  ally traveled some distance (The Herald 2009). 
Since 1998, 10 incidents involving derelict nets have been reported to the Briti  sh Sub Aqua Club (BSAC) 
16Economic Impacts of Marine Litt  er
with 4 of these resulti  ng in no harm to the diver, 5 requiring medical att  enti  on and 1 fatality, although it is 
unclear whether entanglement caused this fatality or occurred later. Most incidents involved monoﬁ  lament netti   ng and very oft  en the diver had to remove their equipment and/or seek help from a buddy to escape from the netti   ng. The BSAC captures all fatal incidents but it is likely that more non-fatal incidents have gone unreported  (Briti  sh Sub Aqua Club, 2010, Personal Communicati  on). 
2.4.3.3 Cut, abrasion and sti  ck (needle) injuriesBeach washed marine litt  er commonly causes minor cut, abrasion and sti  ck (needle) injuries. These are 
generally the result of broken glass, ring pulls, ﬁ  shing line and hooks, and medical wastes such as discarded syringes (Sheavly and Register 2007). In additi  on, there is a relati  vely low risk that contact with infected sanitary products, ﬂ  uids in syringes or other medical equipment, or ingesti  on of any of these could cause disease (Williams et al 2005). The overall extent of these incidents is unknown as most incidents are minor and self-treated while no monitoring systems are in place to report the frequency of more serious incidents.
2.4.3.4 Leaching of poisonous chemicalsWhile plasti  cs themselves are believed to be biochemically inert in the marine environment, they can carry 
toxic compounds that potenti  ally pose health risks to both wildlife and humans. Some of these compounds are added during the manufacture of plasti  cs, while others are absorbed from the surrounding seawater (Thompson et al 2009b). These compounds include persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as PCBs, DDT and bisphenol-A and many of these chemicals are known to have endocrine disrupti  ng eﬀ  ects. There has therefore been “much speculati  on that, if ingested, plasti  c has the potenti  al to transfer toxic substances to the food chain” (Thompson et al 2009b). Given the increasing proliferati  on of plasti  cs in the marine environment and the emergent threat of microplasti  cs, more research is required to evaluate the environmental and health risks associated with chemicals derived from marine plasti  cs (Teuten et al 2009; Thompson et al 2009b).
2.4.4 Economic Impacts of Marine Litt  erThe marine environment is tremendously important economically to communiti  es throughout the world 
and supports a diverse range of acti  viti  es including ﬁ  shing, commercial shipping and tourism. In the UK, for instance, the marine environment contributed an esti  mated £38.9 billion to Gross Domesti  c Product in 2000, which accounts for almost 5% of GDP that year (Pugh and Skinner 2002). Marine litt  er can cause a broad spectrum of economic impacts that both reduce the economic beneﬁ  ts derived from marine and coastal acti  viti  es, and/or increase the costs associated with them (Committ  ee on the Eﬀ  ecti  veness of Internati  onal and Nati  onal Measures to Prevent Marine Debris and Its Impacts et al 2008). 
In practi  ce, the wide diversity of impacts makes measuring the full economic cost resulti  ng from marine litt  er 
extremely complex. Primarily, this is because some impacts can be much more readily evaluated in economic terms than others. Direct economic impacts such as increased litt  er cleansing costs are clearly easier to assess than the economic implicati  ons of ecosystem degradati  on or reduced quality of life. However, a lack of recording mechanisms oft  en means that the direct economic costs of marine litt  er also go unreported.
Establishing the economic costs of marine litt  er is further complicated by the wide variety of approaches 
available for valuing the environment and detrimental anthropogenic impacts. Several approaches aim to determine the economic value of ecosystem goods and services and these methods are parti  cularly useful as they take into account the full spectrum of impacts, both direct and intangible. Unfortunately, very few 17Economic Impacts  of Marine Litt  er
studies have applied this kind of methodology in a marine and coastal context and it has never been used to 
calculate the economic impacts of marine litt  er.
Other methods generally focus on establishing the economic value of human acti  viti  es that are reliant upon 
the environment and how this can be aﬀ  ected by various factors, including marine litt  er. Although these methods are more commonly used in research, they provide only a parti  al insight because they do not take into account the economic cost of intangible social and ecological impacts. These types of methodology have successfully been applied to both the marine and coastal environment as a whole (see Welsh Enterprise 
Insti  tute 2006) and to the marine litt  er problem (Hall 2000; Macfadyen et al 2009). Oft  en studies investi  gati  ng 
the economic impacts of marine litt  er are small-scale, rely on anecdotal evidence and focus on parti  cular aspects of the marine litt  er problem such as ghost ﬁ  shing. Our understanding of the economic signiﬁ  cance of marine litt  er therefore remains relati  vely limited (Ten Brink et al 2009).
2.4.4.1 Litt  er cleansing costs
Removing marine litt  er is necessary to ensure beaches remain aestheti  cally att  racti  ve and safe for potenti  al 
users and this oft  en results in substanti  al litt  er cleansing costs (Ten Brink et al 2009). The vast majority of beach cleansing acti  viti  es are undertaken and paid for by local authoriti  es but community groups and landowners 
may also conduct beach cleans of their own (Hall 2000). The cost of clean ups generally includes the cost of 
collecti  on, transportati  on and disposal of litt  er (Hall 2000; OSPAR 2009) but there may be additi  onal ‘hidden’ costs such as contract management, program administrati  on (Fanshawe and Everard 2002) and volunteer ti  me (Macfadyen et al 2009). The costs involved can be signiﬁ  cant but a lack of reporti  ng mechanisms, use 
of volunteer labour and no standardised methodology outlining exactly what is included as a cost makes 
litt  er cleansing costs diﬃ   cult to quanti  fy and 
compare.
Very limited research has therefore 
been conducted into the costs of 
marine litt  er removal and esti  mates 
tend to be based mostly on anecdotal evidence. Research in 2000 found that 56 UK local authoriti  es spent a 
total of £2,197,138 a year on beach 
cleansing, taking into account the 
cost of collecti  on, transport, disposal charges, workforce, equipment and administrati  on (Hall 2000). More recent esti  mates suggest that the total cost of marine litt  er removal to all UK 
local authoriti  es is approximately £14 million per year (Environment Agency 2004 cited in OSPAR 2009).
Similarly, cleansing of the Swedish Skagerrak coast in 2006 was esti  mated to cost 15 million SEK (about €1.5 million) and took approximately 100 people 4 months to complete (OSPAR 2009). Previous research from this area also reported that only about 30% of marine litt  er was recovered during these operati  ons (Fanshawe and Everard 2002). Research in Poland found that the cost of removing marine litt  er from the shoreline of      
Figure 2.6 Many municipaliti  es use mechanical beach cleaners to remove beach 
litt  er. Image: © iStockphoto/matsou18Economic Impacts of Marine Litt  er
5 municipaliti  es and 2 ports amounted to €570,000 (Naturvårdsverket 2009). 
Numerous voluntary beach cleaning programs also exist including Beachwatch in the UK, the Internati  onal 
Coastal Clean-up coordinated by the Ocean Conservancy and Coastwatch in the Netherlands. These initi  ati  ves oft  en have multi  ple aims including removal of debris, monitoring of litt  er abundance and compositi  on, and raising awareness of marine litt  er issues. Local community groups also regularly operate their own beach cleans such as the highly acclaimed Voar Redd Up
1 conducted annually in the Shetland Islands, UK and these 
are oft  en conducted in conjuncti  on with local authoriti  es. There is therefore immense voluntary involvement in the removal of marine litt  er but quanti  fying the costs of this, parti  cularly in terms of volunteer ti  me, is challenging (OSPAR 2009). What is clear is that in this case the polluter does not currently pay with local authoriti  es and voluntary groups picking up the bill for the removal of marine litt  er (Ten Brink et al 2009).
2.4.4.2 Losses to tourismMarine litt  er is unsightly and potenti  ally hazardous, and can therefore act as a deterrent to tourists. In this 
way, marine litt  er can reduce tourism revenue and consequently weaken coastal economies. While beach users regularly highlight cleanliness as a criti  cal factor in choosing where to visit (Ballance et al 2000; ENCAMS 2005), determining the extent to which marine litt  er aﬀ  ects tourist revenue is very diﬃ   cult, parti  cularly as it is unclear at what density litt  er starts to deter tourists (Ballance et al 2000).
Examples of how marine litt  er aﬀ  ects tourist revenue are thus relati  vely scarce but a South African study 
found that a drop in beach cleanliness standards could reduce tourism revenue by up to 52% in the area studied. This project also investi  gated the densiti  es of litt  er that exerted a deterrent eﬀ  ect on tourists and found that 85% of beach users would not visit a beach with 2 or more large debris items per meter with 97% stati  ng they would not visit a beach with 10 or more large items of debris per meter. Interesti  ngly, however, only 44% of people surveyed classiﬁ  ed the beach they were on as “clean” suggesti  ng that there may be considerable diﬀ  erences between people’s prioriti  es and their acti  ons in practi  ce (Ballance et al 2000). 
Research from Sweden suggests that marine litt  er inhibits tourism there by between 1-5% resulti  ng in a 
loss of £15million in revenue and 150 person-years of work (Ten Brink et al 2009). In extreme cases, marine litt  er can also lead to the closure of beaches, as was the case in New Jersey and New York in 1988. This was esti  mated to cost the regional economy between $379million and $3.6billion in lost tourist and other revenue (Committ  ee on the Eﬀ  ecti  veness of Internati  onal and Nati  onal Measures to Prevent and Reduce Marine Debris and Its Impacts et al 2008). 
2.4.4.3 Losses to ﬁ  sheriesMarine litt  er has a twofold impact on ﬁ  sheries by increasing costs to ﬁ  shing vessels as well as reducing potenti  al 
catches and revenue through ghost ﬁ  shing. The direct costs associated with marine litt  er have rarely been studied but include repairing damage to the vessel and equipment including disentangling fouled propellers, replacement of lost gear, loss in earnings from reduced ﬁ  shing ti  me and restricted and/or contaminated catch due to the presence of marine litt  er in hauls. Research focusing on the Shetland ﬁ  shing ﬂ  eet found that marine litt  er could cost a vessel up to £30,000 a year (Hall 2000). A separate study looking at the Scotti   sh Clyde ﬁ  shery reported that losses of up to $21,000 in lost ﬁ  shing gear and $38,000 in lost ﬁ  shing ti  me were experienced by a single trap ﬁ  sher in 2002 (Watson and Bryson 2003 cited in Macfadyen et al 2009).
1 Voar Redd Up means ‘spring clean’ in Shetland dialect.19Economic Impacts  of Marine Litt  er
Ghost ﬁ  shing also reduces the catch available to ﬁ  shing vessels and therefore results in a loss of ﬁ  sheries 
revenue (Macfadyen et al 2009). Several studies have investi  gated the economic importance of ghost ﬁ  shing and this appears to be highly variable between diﬀ  erent types of ﬁ  sheries (Brown et al 2005). Ghost ﬁ  shing 
in the tangle and gillnet ﬁ  sheries is equivalent to less than 5% of EU commercial landings (Committ  ee on the 
Eﬀ  ecti  veness of Internati  onal and Nati  onal Measures to Prevent and Reduce Marine Debris and Its Impacts et al 2008) while the ghost catch of monkﬁ  sh in the Cantabrian sea equates to approximately 1.46% of landings (Brown et al 2005). In the USA, an esti  mated $250million worth of marketable lobster is lost to ghost ﬁ  shing annually (Allsopp et al 2006) and between 4-10million blue crabs are trapped in ghost ﬁ  shing gear each year 
in Louisiana (Macfadyen et al 2009). 
In the longer term, the impact of ghost ﬁ  shing on the conservati  on and recovery of vulnerable ﬁ  sh stocks may 
have much deeper economic eﬀ  ects (Sheavly and Register 2007). As the ICC suggests “in the Chesapeake Bay 
and its tributaries, where the blue crab populati  on has crashed, every crab lost means one step further away 
from recovery for a species that provides economic support for enti  re communiti  es” (ICC 2009: 17) and the 
viability of other vulnerable species may be similarly aﬀ  ected (Sheavly and Register 2007).
2.4.4.4 Losses to aquacultureMarine litt  er can result in economic losses to aquaculture producers (UNEP 2009) as a result of damage to 
vessels and equipment, removal of debris and staﬀ   downti  me. Entangled propellers and blocked intake pipes present the most common problems for aquaculture operators and can result in costly repairs and lost ti  me. In additi  on, the ti  me required to remove debris ﬂ  oati  ng in or around stock cages can represent a considerable cost to aquaculture organisati  ons. Research quanti  fying the extent of these issues is sparse but a study in 2000 found that on average one hour per month was spent removing debris and disentangling fouled propellers could cost up to £1,200 per incident (Hall 2000). 
2.4.4.5 Costs to shippingShipping faces increased costs from marine litt  er 
resulti  ng from vessel damage and downti  me (Ten Brink et al 2009), litt  er removal and management in harbours and marinas (UNEP 2009), and emergency rescue operati  ons to vessels stricken by marine litt  er (Macfadyen et al 2009). For vessel operators, entangled propellers and rudders are the most common issue and can seriously damage vessels resulti  ng in expensive repairs, crew downti  me and safety concerns for the crew (Hall 2000). While this can aﬀ  ect both recreati  onal craft   as well as commercial shipping, the vast majority of incidents go unreported making it extremely diﬃ   cult to assess the true extent of the problem (Laist and Liﬀ  mann 2000; Sheavly 2005).
Harbours and marinas face increased costs 
associated with marine litt  er removal in order 
Figure 2.7: Removing marine litt  er can be costly for harbours and 
marinas. Image: KIMO Internati  onal.20Economic Impacts of Marine Litt  er
to ensure that their faciliti  es are safe and att  racti  ve for users.  This can involve both the manual removal 
of ﬂ  oati  ng debris and additi  onal dredging to remove items obstructi  ng the seabed. Although the costs of these acti  viti  es are believed to be signiﬁ  cant (UNEP 2009), only one study, undertaken by Hall in 2000, has investi  gated the costs marine litt  er poses for harbours and marinas. For harbours in the UK, the removal of debris could cost up to £15,000 a year with manual clearance of the harbour required up to four ti  mes per 
week. Incidences of fouled propellers were also reported by 82% of harbours, although these costs are borne 
by vessel operators themselves. Anecdotal evidence received from marinas during the same study suggested 
that some marinas had to be manually cleaned on a daily basis at a cost of up to £10,000 a year (Hall 2000).
The cost of emergency rescues to vessels stricken by marine litt  er can also be substanti  al and most operati  ons 
are commonly a result of entangled or fouled propellers. Research in 1998 found that 230 rescues were 
undertaken to vessels with fouled propellers in UK waters at a cost of £2,200 to £5,800 per incident, depending 
on the type of lifeboat required. This amounted to an overall cost of between £506,000 and £1,334,000 
for that year (Hall 2000). In 2005, the US Coastguard made 269 rescues to incidents involving marine litt  er 
resulti  ng in 15 deaths, 116 injuries and $3 million in property damage (Moore 2008).
2.4.4.6 Control and eradicati  on of invasive non-nati  ve species
Non-nati  ve species can travel by a number of means including through the colonisati  on of marine litt  er (Moore 
2008; Gregory 2009). While tracing occurrences of non-nati  ve species back to marine litt  er is extremely 
diﬃ   cult, marine litt  er is esti  mated to have doubled the opportuniti  es for marine organisms to travel at tropical 
lati  tudes and more than tripled it at high (>50°) lati  tudes (Allsopp et al 2006). The introducti  on of invasive 
non-nati  ve species can have a highly damaging impact on the environment (Derraik 2002; Gregory 2009) and 
result in substanti  al economic costs and losses (Donnan 2009). 
At the very least, the discovery of invasive species results in increased costs due to monitoring, control 
and eradicati  on measures. Additi  onal losses can be incurred from the fouling of equipment and vessels, 
deteriorati  on of ecosystem functi  ons, loss of amenity value and impacts on human health (Donnan 2009). In 
a relati  vely short period of ti  me, invasive species can destroy enti  re ecosystems and decimate the industries 
that relied upon them. The introducti  on of the American comb jellyﬁ  sh into the Black Sea during the 1990s, 
for instance, is widely accepted to have caused the collapse of the anchovy ﬁ  sheries with economic losses of 
€240million (Naturvårdsverket 2009).
The discovery of the Carpet sea squirt (Didemnum vexillum ) in Holyhead Harbour in Wales in 2009 illustrates 
the range of costs involved in the control and eradicati  on of invasive species. The carpet sea squirt has no 
known predators and its thick, sheet-like growths can smother organisms and marine habitats. The means 
by which the carpet sea squirt reached Holyhead Harbour are unknown but an eradicati  on and monitoring 
program over the next 10 years is expected to cost approximately £525,000. The costs of inacti  on, however, 
could amount to up to £6,875,625 over the same period for the nearby mussel ﬁ  sheries alone and could be signiﬁ  cantly higher were the carpet sea squirt to become established elsewhere in UK waters (Holt 2009).
2.4.4.7 Costs to coastal agriculture
Marine litt  er can cause a broad spectrum of hazards and costs for the agriculture industry including damage 
to property and equipment, harm to livestock, additi  onal vets bills and lost ti  me removing debris (Hall 2000). 
Virtually no research, however, has been undertaken to document the extent and signiﬁ  cance of these 
impacts. A project in 2000 focusing on agriculture in Shetland found that 96% of responding farmers had 21Economic Impacts  of Marine Litt  er
experienced problems with debris blowing onto their land and this could cost them up to £400 a year (Hall 
2000). Unfortunately, no similar research has been undertaken to assess the extent of the problem in other locati  ons.
2.4.4.8 Costs to power stati  onsThe eﬀ  ects of marine litt  er on power stati  ons can include blockage of cooling water intake screens, increased 
removal of debris from screens and additi  onal maintenance costs. Determining the extent of these costs is complex, parti  cularly as costs resulti  ng from marine litt  er are diﬃ   cult to diﬀ  erenti  ate from those due to natural debris such as seaweed. Anecdotal evidence suggests that marine litt  er can cost companies up to £50,000 to remove with additi  onal costs for pump maintenance (Hall 2000) but it is unknown how widespread these impacts are.
2.4.4.9 Environmental damage and ecosystem degradati  on
From the entanglement of wildlife to the loss of biodiversity, marine litt  er can aﬀ  ect the environment in 
numerous ways. While these eﬀ  ects are all likely to have economic implicati  ons, evaluati  ng environmental damage in economic terms is extremely challenging and has generally not been addressed by research. Therefore “we do not have a complete picture of the magnitude of economic damages associated with the ecological eﬀ  ects of marine debris” (Laist and Liﬀ  mann 2000).
Establishing what the long-term eﬀ  ects of marine litt  er will be on the environment is similarly highly complex 
and diﬃ   cult to translate into economic damages. The potenti  al for marine litt  er to contribute to ecosystem deteriorati  on and aﬀ  ect the oceans’ resilience to large-scale perturbati  ons in future is a criti  cal concern (Derraik 2002; ICC 2009) and research is urgently required to investi  gate what the costs, both environmental and economic, of taking no further acti  on to reduce marine litt  er will be.22Economic Impacts of Marine Litt  er
3. Legislati  on and Policy Context
3.1 Key internati  onal legislati  on
A wide range of internati  onal agreements and legislati  on both directly and indirectly address the problem 
of marine litt  er. Several pieces of legislati  on are speciﬁ  cally designed to reduce marine litt  er and prevent the discharge of waste into the marine environment but many of the existi  ng agreements take a broader approach and outline fundamental principles for the sustainable use and conservati  on of the oceans. The key pieces of internati  onal legislati  on are brieﬂ  y outlined below.
3.1.1 United Nati  ons Conventi  on on Oceans and the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)UNCLOS is designed to comprehensively govern the management of marine resources and their conservati  on 
for future generati  ons. Provisions of the Conventi  on include territorial sea limits, conservati  on and management of living marine resources, protecti  on of the marine environment, economic and commercial acti  viti  es, marine scienti  ﬁ  c research and a binding procedure for the sett  lement of disputes relati  ng to the oceans. 
The protecti  on and preservati  on of the marine environment is addressed by Part XII of the Conventi  on 
(Arti  cles 192-237) which outlines basic obligati  ons to prevent, reduce and control polluti  on from land-based sources; polluti  on from sea-bed acti  viti  es subject to nati  onal jurisdicti  on; polluti  on from acti  viti  es in the Area; polluti  on by dumping; polluti  on from vessels; and polluti  on from or through the atmosphere. Marine litt  er was speciﬁ  cally addressed in November 2005 as part of UN General Assembly Resoluti  on A/RES/60/30 – Oceans and the Law of the sea, which states:
“…The General Assembly,65. Notes the lack of informati  on and data on marine debris and encourages relevant nati  onal and internati  onal 
organisati  ons to undertake further studies on the extent and nature of the problem, also encourages States to 
develop partnerships with industry and civil society to raise awareness of the extent of the impact of marine litt  er on the health and producti  vity of the marine environment and consequent economic loss;
66. Urges States to integrate the issue of marine debris within nati  onal strategies dealing with waste 
management in the coastal zone, ports and mariti  me industries, including recycling, reuse, reducti  on and 
disposal, and to encourage the development of appropriate economic incenti  ves to address this issue including the development of cost recovery systems that provide an incenti  ve to use port recepti  on faciliti  es and discourage ships from discharging marine debris at sea, and encourages States to cooperate regionally and subregionally to develop and implement joint preventi  on and recovery programmes for marine debris;…”
3.1.2 Internati  onal Conventi  on for the Preventi  on of Marine Polluti  on from Ships, 1973, as modiﬁ  ed by the 
Protocol of 1978 relati  ng thereto (MARPOL 73/78) Annex V
The MARPOL Conventi  on is the key internati  onal agreement to prevent polluti  on of the marine environment 
by ships and has six annexes concentrati  ng on diﬀ  erent types of polluti  on, as shown in Table 3.1 overleaf. Annex I (Oil) and Annex II (Chemicals) are compulsory but the other annexes are voluntary. 23Economic Impacts  of Marine Litt  er
Annex I Oil
Annex II Noxious liquid substances by bulk
Annex IIIHarmful substances carried by sea in packaged form or freight 
containers, portable tanks, or road and rail tank wagons
Annex IV Sewage
Annex V Garbage
Annex VI Air polluti  on
                 Table 3.1 Polluti  on types covered by MARPOL Annexes I-VI
MARPOL Annex V regulates the types and quanti  ti  es of garbage that ships may discharge into the sea and 
speciﬁ  es the distances from land and manner in which they may be disposed of. For the purposes of Annex V, garbage includes “all kinds of food, domesti  c and operati  ng waste, excluding fresh ﬁ  sh, generated during the normal operati  on of the vessel and liable to be disposed of conti  nuously or periodically” (IMO 2002). 
Under these regulati  ons, the disposal of plasti  c anywhere into the sea is strictly prohibited and the discharge 
of other wastes is severely restricted in coastal waters and “Special Areas”. The North Sea and adjacent areas are designated “Special Areas” under MARPOL Annex V and in accordance with these regulati  ons, discharges of garbage, except food waste, into the sea are strictly prohibited. 
As of March 2010, 140 states have rati  ﬁ  ed MARPOL Annex V and these regulati  ons now cover 97.5% of the 
world’s shipping tonnage (IMO 2010). The Internati  onal Mariti  me Organisati  on (IMO) is currently reviewing MARPOL Annex V, in consultati  on with relevant stakeholders, to assess and improve its eﬀ  ecti  veness in addressing ocean-based sources of marine litt  er.
3.1.3 London Conventi  on on the Preventi  on of Marine Polluti  on by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matt  er, 
1972, and 1996 Protocol relati  ng thereto 
The London Conventi  on aims to promote the eﬀ  ecti  ve management of all sources of marine polluti  on and 
prevent the dumping of wastes and other matt  er at sea. It operates using a “black- and grey-list approach” whereby dumping of all blacklist items is strictly prohibited; dumping of grey-list materials requires a special permission and is subject to strict control; and the dumping of all other items is allowed with a general permit. Annex I of the London Conventi  on explicitly prohibits signatories from dumping persistent plasti  cs and other non-biodegradable materials into the sea from ships and other man-made structures.
Agreed in 1996, the London Protocol aims to modernise the Conventi  on and will eventually replace it. The 
Protocol’s objecti  ve is to protect the marine environment from all sources of polluti  on and therefore all dumping is prohibited under the Protocol with the excepti  on of possibly acceptable wastes on the “reverse list”. States can be a Party to either the London Conventi  on 1972, or the 1996 Protocol, or both.
3.1.4 Other internati  onal agreementsThe following internati  onal agreements are also important for the protecti  on of the marine environment and 
the preventi  on of marine litt  er.

3.2 Key European legislati  on
The European Union has introduced a number of directi  ves that aﬀ  ect the marine litt  er problem. Although 
this legislati  on addresses a wide range of issues, they can be broadly categorised into directi  ves that address the sustainable use of the marine environment; directi  ves that focus on reducing ship based polluti  on and directi  ves that address the wider issue of waste in general. The key pieces of European legislati  on are outlined below.
3.2.1 EU Marine Strategy Framework Directi  ve (2008/56/EC)The Marine Strategy Framework Directi  ve (MSFD) was agreed in 2008 and is the ﬁ  rst integrated policy for the 
protecti  on of the marine environment. The MSFD aims to address multi  ple threats to the marine environment including climate change, over ﬁ  shing, loss of biodiversity, eutrophicati  on, introducti  on of alien species and polluti  on from land- and ocean-based sources.  Under the MSFD, Member States are required to develop strategies to achieve or maintain good environmental status in the marine environment by the year 2020 and must meet a strict ti  metable for implementati  on. 
Good environmental status is deﬁ  ned under the MSFD as “the environmental status of marine waters where 
these provide ecologically diverse and dynamic oceans and seas which are clean, healthy and producti  ve within their intrinsic conditi  ons, and the use of the marine environment is at a level that is sustainable, thus safeguarding the potenti  al for uses and acti  viti  es by current and future generati  ons”. The MSFD also outlines 11 qualitati  ve descriptors for determining good environmental status, one of which explicitly identi  ﬁ  es marine litt  er as an issue to be addressed by the MSFD. The descriptor states that to achieve good environmental status, the “properti  es and quanti  ti  es of marine litt  er do not cause harm to the coastal and marine environment”

3.2.2 EU Directi  ve on port recepti  on faciliti  es for ship-generated waste and cargo residues (EC2000/59)
This Directi  ve aims to signiﬁ  cantly reduce the illegal discharge of ship-generated waste and cargo residues 
into the marine environment by improving the availability and use of port recepti  on faciliti  es. The regulati  ons entered into force in July 2003 and key terms include: 
The mandatory provision of waste recepti  on faciliti  es in all ports, tailored to the size of port and type • 
of vessels calling there. Ports must draw up waste recepti  on and handling plans to be inspected and approved by Member States every three yearsAll ships must deliver their waste to the port recepti  on faciliti  es before leaving the port or terminal, • 
unless they are exempt or have suﬃ   cient dedicated storage capacity to store the waste unti  l the next port of callCaptains of ships bound for a port or terminal must noti  fy it of certain informati  on including the types • 
and quanti  ti  es of waste for discharge and the date and last port where waste was dischargedShips that do not deliver waste in one port and who are not subject to an exempti  on will be reported • 
to their next port of call and required to undergo a detailed inspecti  on before cargo and passengers

Ports must establish a cost-recovery system to encourage vessels to discharge their waste on land and • 
discourage dumping at sea. All ships must pay a mandatory charge to make a signiﬁ  cant contributi  on to the cost of the port recepti  on faciliti  es for ship generated waste, irrespecti  ve of whether they use them or notMember states must ensure proper monitoring of compliance with the directi  ve, both by ships and • 
ports, and submit a progress report to the European Commission every three years about the status of the Directi  ve’s implementati  on
3.2.3 Other European legislati  on
The following European directi  ves also contain provisions that aﬀ  ect marine litt  er:
EU Bathing Water Directi  ve (76/160/EEC and 2006/7/EC)• 
EC Urban Waste Water Treatment Directi  ve (91/271/EEC and 98/15/EC)• 
EU Environmental Liability Directi  ve (2004/35/EC) • 
EU Directi  ve on Packaging and Packaging waste (2004/12/EC)• 
EU Waste Framework Directi  ve 2006/12/EEC (to be replaced by 2008/98/EC with eﬀ  ect from 12 • 
December 2010)
3.3 Nati  onal legislati  onThere is no nati  onal legislati  on or policy dedicated to addressing marine litt  er in any country within the 
North Atlanti  c region. Many countries have, however, passed legislati  on to enact the European directi  ves and key pieces of internati  onal legislati  on, such as MARPOL, that have a bearing on marine litt  er. Nati  onal legislati  on to address waste management, litt  ering and the illegal discharge of waste is also common in countries throughout this region. 
In 2009, the United Kingdom became the ﬁ  rst country in the world to introduce a single piece of legislati  on 
to protect the marine environment when it passed the Marine and Coastal Access Act. This act outlines the Government’s vision for “clean, healthy, safe, producti  ve and biologically diverse oceans and seas” (DEFRA 2009) and sets out a framework for delivering sustainable marine and coastal development, taking into account environmental, social and economic concerns. 26Economic Impacts of Marine Litt  er
4. Methodology
Taking Hall’s (2000) pioneering project as a starti  ng point, the methodology adopted here focuses on the 
economic impact of marine litt  er on human acti  viti  es and uses a sector-based approach to investi  gate the increased costs and potenti  al loss of revenue associated with marine litt  er for key industries. This approach does not include an evaluati  on of the economic cost of degradati  on of ecosystem goods and services due to marine litt  er and the ﬁ  ndings presented in this report are therefore likely to signiﬁ  cantly underesti  mate the total economic costs of marine litt  er.
4.1 Developing a methodologyMarine litt  er can directly cause numerous economic impacts, parti  cularly in terms of litt  er clearance and 
removal. Marine litt  er can also result in a wide range of indirect economic impacts, which are associated with the environmental, social, and public health and safety impacts of marine litt  er. Evaluati  ng the direct economic impacts of marine litt  er such as increased litt  er cleansing costs is relati  vely straightf  orward but many other impacts, parti  cularly environmental eﬀ  ects, can be diﬃ   cult to translate into economic terms. Loss of ecosystem functi  ons and reduced biodiversity, for example, will clearly have economic implicati  ons but in practi  ce these are very diﬃ   cult to measure. Esti  mati  ng the full economic impact of marine litt  er is therefore complex as many impacts are challenging to quanti  fy in economic terms.
As a result, “to date, very litt  le informati  on has been reported on the economic impacts of marine litt  er” 
(UNEP 2009a: 10) and Hall’s (2000) project remains one of the few studies to investi  gate the economic cost of marine litt  er. The approach adopted by Hall focused on establishing how marine litt  er aﬀ  ected the economic value of human acti  viti  es that relied upon a healthy marine environment. In practi  ce, this was applied in terms of the increased costs or potenti  al loss of revenue incurred due to marine litt  er by various key industries. 
It was decided to follow a similar approach in this assessment for several reasons. Firstly, research focusing 
on the economic value of human acti  viti  es has a strong theoreti  cal basis and has been applied previously in a marine litt  er context. This approach was similarly att  racti  ve due to its relati  ve simplicity and, as it is based on actual expenditure, the increased likelihood that data would be available. Narrowing the focus of the project to examine the economic impacts of marine litt  er upon human acti  viti  es, rather than the full spectrum of economic impacts, also enabled the project to balance key ti  me and resource constraints.
Putti   ng this approach into practi  ce ﬁ  rstly involved identi  fying the key sectors of human acti  vity that could be 
aﬀ  ected by marine litt  er. The sectors involved in this project are:
Agriculture• 
Aquaculture• 
Fisheries• 
Harbours• 
Industrial seawater users• 
Marinas• 
Municipaliti  es• 
Power stati  ons• 
Rescue services• 
Voluntary organisati  ons• 
Water Authoriti  es• 27Economic Impacts  of Marine Litt  er
Each sector was then assessed individually to determine how marine litt  er could aﬀ  ect them and the ways in 
which it could result in increased costs and/or a loss of revenue, as outlined in Figure 4.1 overleaf. Separate questi  onnaires were then developed for each sector based on these issues and these were distributed to 
organisati  ons throughout the Northeast Atlanti  c region. Questi  onnaires were identi  ﬁ  ed as the most suitable 
method for collecti  ng data as the project focused on a wide variety of sectors in a number of diﬀ  erent countries. 
Short follow up questi  onnaires were also developed to investi  gate the wider context of the impacts of marine 
litt  er. These follow up questi  onnaires were broadly similar for all sectors and were designed to provide insights 
into the percepti  ons, sensiti  vity and prioriti  es of various sectors with regard to marine litt  er and its impact on the marine environment. 
4.2 Data collecti  on
The project began in 2007 and was conducted over a 3-year period due to changes in personnel. The project’s 
focus on the Northeast Atlanti  c region required the distributi  on of questi  onnaires in a number of countries and this was carried out in conjuncti  on with KIMO networks. Oft  en, the support of industry organisati  ons and associati  ons was invaluable in making contacts and distributi  ng the questi  onnaires. The majority of questi  onnaires were sent out via post or email but some were also conducted over the telephone and distributed at meeti  ngs. 
The main project questi  onnaires were distributed in all the countries involved in 2007/2008. Based on the 
responses received, a clear format for the project emerged structured around a UK core with case studies and anecdotal evidence from other countries wherever data was available. To achieve this, it was necessary to strengthen the number of UK responses received and therefore a second set of questi  onnaires was distributed within the UK in 2009. In total, 2,090 questi  onnaires were distributed and Table 4.1 below shows how these were divided between countries. Reﬂ  ecti  ng the ﬁ  nal structure of the project, the majority of questi  onnaires were distributed within the UK.

All questi  onnaires were completed in each country’s respecti  ve currency and then converted into Euros. As 
the main questi  onnaires were completed in two separate stages, the conversion was conducted according to 
the deadlines for completi  on set for each group of questi  onnaires in order to take account of inﬂ  ati  on. For 
the ﬁ  rst group of questi  onnaires, this was 1 April 2008 and for the second set it was 1 December 2009. 
4.3 Limitati  ons
While the methodology adopted in this project has largely been highly successful, it is important to 
acknowledge several key limitati  ons. Principle among these is the use of an approach that focuses solely on 
the economic value of human acti  viti  es. This approach can only provide a parti  al insight into the economic 
cost of marine litt  er because it excludes the economic cost of the environmental and social eﬀ  ects of marine litt  er from analysis. This project is therefore likely to substanti  ally underesti  mate the full economic cost of 
marine litt  er to coastal communiti  es around the Northeast Atlanti  c.
Similarly, the methodology used in this project is limited to cases where individuals and organisati  ons actually 
spend money to deal with marine litt  er. Economic constraints may prevent organisati  ons from fully dealing with marine litt  er and therefore the true economic impact of marine litt  er may be greater than the ﬁ  ndings 31Economic Impacts  of Marine Litt  er
here suggest. Local authoriti  es, for example, may only remove a proporti  on of beach washed marine litt  er 
due to budget restricti  ons and the cost to remove all litt  er could be signiﬁ  cantly higher. Establishing the costs 
of marine litt  er is further complicated by a lack of data recording mechanisms, which means that costs may oft  en go unreported.32Economic Impacts of Marine Litt  er
5. Municipaliti  es
5.1 Introducti  on
The principle economic impact of marine litt  er on municipaliti  es is the cost of keeping beaches clean and free 
of litt  er. The costs associated with removing marine litt  er include the collecti  on, transportati  on and disposal of litt  er as well as hidden costs such as contract management, program administrati  on and volunteer ti  me. 
A questi  onnaire was developed to ﬁ  nd out more about beach cleansing acti  viti  es and this was distributed to 
local government organisati  ons in countries throughout the Northeast Atlanti  c region.

5.2.1 Beach cleansing
In total, 54 municipaliti  es or 93.1% of respondents removed marine litt  er from their coastline. These 
municipaliti  es were asked to select the main reason(s) why they undertake beach cleans and the results are shown in Figure 5.1 below. Only 4 municipaliti  es reported that they did not undertake beach cleans, primarily 
because they had very litt  le or no direct responsibility for the coastline in their area. 
Figure 5.1: Reasons why municipaliti  es undertake beach cleans
Figure 5.1 clearly shows that ensuring beaches are clean, att  racti  ve and safe for tourists is a key priority for 
municipaliti  es and justi  ﬁ  es the cost of removing marine litt  er. Protecti  ng tourism and the local economy also appears to provide a more powerful incenti  ve for removing marine litt  er than current legislati  on and statutory requirements. The negati  ve economic impacts associated with marine litt  er therefore act as a key means to justi  fy and sti  mulate acti  on to tackle marine litt  er.
The presti  gious Blue Flag Awards also contribute to tourism as they are designed to “guarantee to tourists 33Economic Impacts  of Marine Litt  er
that a beach…is one of the best in the world” (Keep Britain Tidy 2010) and that it meets recognised standards in 
terms of safety, water quality, cleanliness and faciliti  es. Marine litt  er was removed by 46.3% of municipaliti  es to ensure that a beach or beaches in their area met the criteria for the Blue Flag Awards. These awards tend to apply only to busier resort beaches and a number of other award systems have been introduced to recognise beaches that are managed to a high standard but are not eligible for Blue Flag Awards. These include the Quality Coast Awards, the Green Coast Awards and the Seaside Awards. Several municipaliti  es reported that they undertook beach cleans in order to pursue these types of awards.
Municipaliti  es were also keenly aware of the public health risks that marine litt  er poses with 51.9% of 
respondents identi  fying this as a reason to carry out beach cleans. Similarly, concerns about how marine litt  er could aﬀ  ect wildlife reserves led 22.2% of municipaliti  es to remove marine litt  er. Comparati  vely few municipaliti  es removed marine litt  er because “marine debris was aﬀ  ecti  ng local businesses” while 8 municipaliti  es reported that they undertook beach cleans because the coastline was known to have a marine debris problem. Although only a small minority of municipaliti  es reported these issues, it is nonetheless a cause for concern that marine litt  er aﬀ  ects any municipality to this degree.
Municipaliti  es oft  en collaborated with other organisati  ons to remove beach litt  er and 64.8% of municipaliti  es 
received some form of external help with their beach cleaning acti  viti  es. This assistance came from a variety of sources, including commercial sponsorship, but municipaliti  es mostly worked in partnership with voluntary groups. In several cases, the municipality did not directly clean any of its beaches but instead provided support and resources for voluntary groups to undertake beach cleans instead.

Many organisati  ons also conducted independent beach cleans with no council involvement and this was 
the case for 72.4% of parti  cipati  ng municipaliti  es. The vast majority of these beach cleans were undertaken by voluntary groups such as schools, environmental groups, university societi  es, surf clubs and the Scouts. Several municipaliti  es also reported that the probati  on service and commercial businesses undertook independent beach cleans. Overall, municipaliti  es reported a high level of volunteer engagement in beach cleaning acti  viti  es.
5.2.2 Beach characteristi  cs and cleansing regimesSeveral questi  ons were designed to build up a picture of the beaches cleaned and to identi  fy any trends in 
cleansing regimes. These questi  ons focused on the number of beaches cleaned by each municipality in terms of type, usage, ownership and user groups. Questi  ons were also asked about how oft  en beaches were cleaned and the methods used to do so. Unfortunately, the majority of municipaliti  es found it diﬃ   cult to provide this informati  on for each beach they cleaned and the ﬁ  gures in this secti  on therefore refer to the number of municipaliti  es answering a questi  on rather than the number of beaches involved. As a consequence, these results are therefore not comparable with the ﬁ  ndings reported by Hall in 2000.
Within each municipality area, cleansing was generally carried out on more than one type of beach and the 
percentage of municipaliti  es cleaning each type of beach is shown in Figure 5.3 below. Municipaliti  es most commonly cleaned sandy beaches, which reﬂ  ects both tourists’ preferences for this type of beach and the increased diﬃ   culty involved in cleaning rocky beaches.
Figure 5.3: Percentage of municipaliti  es remove beach litt  er from each type of beach
Over 90% of municipaliti  es owned the beaches and coastlines where they removed beach litt  er with a small 
number reporti  ng that private businesses and individuals also owned some of the beaches cleaned in their area. Approximately 25% of municipaliti  es also identi  ﬁ  ed ‘other’ owners of the beaches and coastline cleaned including:35Economic Impacts  of Marine Litt  er
The Ministry of Defence• 
The Crown Estate• 
The Church Commission• 
The Nati  onal Trust• 
A general trend was also evident in terms of beach usage with more popular beaches more likely to be 
cleaned by municipaliti  es. Highly used beaches were most commonly cleaned with 90.2% of municipaliti  es reporti  ng that they removed marine litt  er from these beaches. Over half of municipaliti  es (54.9%) undertook cleans on beaches with medium usage and slightly less (43.1%) removed marine litt  er from beaches with low usage. A small minority of 11.8% of respondents also carried out clean up operati  ons on isolated beaches. 
Municipaliti  es were also asked to identi  fy the key user groups of the coastline where clean ups were located 
and the results are displayed in Figure 5.4 below. Over 95% of municipaliti  es identi  ﬁ  ed tourists as a key user group of the coastline in questi  on, which again reﬂ  ects the importance of tourism as a sti  mulus for the removal of marine litt  er. Highlighti  ng the diverse uses of the marine environment, several municipaliti  es also suggested additi  onal user groups such as water sports enthusiasts, power stati  ons and wildlife tour operators.
Figure 5.4: Percentage of municipaliti  es which identi  ﬁ  ed each group as key users of the coastline
Obtaining informati  on about how frequently beaches were cleaned was more challenging since many 
municipaliti  es operate variable cleansing regimes according to the beach and the season. While it is diﬃ   cult to pick out any trends in the data, 76.3% of municipaliti  es did report that they cleaned beaches on a daily/weekly basis but this was oft  en only during the high season. Many municipaliti  es cleaned less well-used beaches on an as necessary basis, parti  cularly during the winter months. 
Beach cleans can either be conducted manually or using various types of machinery. In total, 51% of 36Economic Impacts of Marine Litt  er
municipaliti  es removed marine litt  er manually while 47% used a combinati  on of both mechanical and manual 
methods. Only 1 municipality used mechanical methods alone.
5.2.3 Length of coastline where marine litt  er is removedAs part of the questi  onnaire, municipaliti  es were asked to specify the length of coastline where marine 
litt  er was removed and 48 municipaliti  es were able to provide this informati  on. In total, these municipaliti  es cleaned 839 km of beaches and coastline with an average of 17.5km per municipality.  The smallest distance cleaned by a single authority was 400m and the largest was 150km. Overall, the distance cleaned by the municipaliti  es surveyed represents approximately 4.7% of the total UK coastline
3.
5.2.4 Weight and volume of litt  er collected
A total of 19 municipaliti  es were able to provide informati  on about the weight of litt  er removed from beaches 
in their area. This ranged from 1 to 12,000 tonnes and amounted to 21,757 tonnes of litt  er in total. Therefore 
the average amount of marine litt  er removed per municipality was 1,145 tonnes. 
A further 10 municipaliti  es were able to provide informati  on about the volume of litt  er they removed in terms 
of the number of refuse sacks collected. A total of 28,561 refuse sacks were collected by these municipaliti  es and several also gave details of other large items of marine litt  er they had encountered, including:
Crates• 
Plasti  c oil drums• 
Fish boxes• 
Tyres• 
Barbeques• 
Complete ﬁ  shing nets• 
However, it is important to note that the impact of marine litt  er is not necessarily related to the quanti  ti  es of litt  er involved. This is parti  cularly true in terms of visual impact as small lengths of syntheti  c rope and cord, for example, weigh very litt  le but can have an extremely high visual impact.
5.2.5 Disposal methods and litt  er preventi  on measuresLandﬁ  ll, incinerati  on and recycling are the three main opti  ons available for the disposal of marine litt  er and 
many municipaliti  es oft  en use a combinati  on of these methods. Landﬁ  ll is most commonly used with 88.5% of municipaliti  es reporti  ng that they disposed of marine litt  er using this approach. Marine litt  er is recycled by 43.3% of municipaliti  es and 17.3% incinerate the litt  er they collect. Only one municipality recycled all their litt  er with many using a combinati  on of landﬁ  ll and recycling to dispose of marine litt  er. 
These results suggest that the way in which municipaliti  es dispose of marine litt  er has changed signiﬁ  cantly 
since Hall’s pilot project in 2000. In Hall’s study, 100% of parti  cipati  ng municipaliti  es disposed of marine litt  er using landﬁ  ll with 21.5% also using recycling and just 3.6% using incinerati  on. While the increasing emphasis

17,818.66 km. This was used to calculate the percentage of the UK coastline cleaned by the municipaliti  es in this project (839km 
as a percentage of 17,818.66km). 37Economic Impacts  of Marine Litt  er
on recycling is encouraging, it remains diﬃ   cult to determine whether a signiﬁ  cant quanti  ty of marine litt  er is 
being recycled. 
Virtually all the municipaliti  es involved had put in place some type of litt  er preventi  on measures with only 1 
municipality reporti  ng that it took no acti  on whatsoever to prevent litt  er. Litt  er bins were the most common preventi  on method with 94.3% of municipaliti  es reporti  ng that they used these on beaches and coastlines within their area. Noti  ces were also popular and 71.7% of municipaliti  es used these to discourage litt  ering and promote responsible waste practi  ces. Many municipaliti  es were also taking additi  onal acti  on to prevent 
litt  er such as:
Fixed penalty noti  ces and ﬁ  nes for litt  ering • 
Raising awareness of litt  er issues in the community through newslett  ers, talks, school visits and other • 
promoti  onal acti  viti  esWarden and staﬀ   patrols on busy beaches• 
Providing speciﬁ  c recycling bins and faciliti  es on beaches for parti  cular types of litt  er•

5.2.6 Economic cost of beach litt  er
A key aim of this project focused on establishing the direct costs to municipaliti  es resulti  ng from marine 
litt  er, parti  cularly in terms of beach cleansing costs. Of the 58 UK municipaliti  es surveyed during this project, only 28 were in a positi  on to provide ﬁ  gures relati  ng to beach cleansing costs and budgets. Virtually all the municipaliti  es that could not provide cost data att  ributed this to a lack of budget or contract breakdowns rather than because marine litt  er posed no cost to their authority. Similarly, very few municipaliti  es were aware of the speciﬁ  c costs involved in supporti  ng voluntary groups to undertake beach cleans.
Questi  ons in this secti  on focused on the cost of clean ups, the budget for such acti  viti  es and the cost of 
litt  er preventi  on measures. Keep Scotland Beauti  ful also kindly shared data collected during one of their projects, which contained informati  on about the economic cost of marine litt  er for a further 3 municipaliti  es in Scotland. 
5.2.6.1 Total cost and breakdown of expenditureThe total cost of removing beach litt  er reported by 28 municipaliti  es in the UK was €3,893,209.93 with an 
average of €139,043.21 spent on removing beach litt  er per municipality each year. With the inclusion of the Keep Scotland Beauti  ful data, this rises to a total expenditure of €4,513,189.28 by 31 municipaliti  es with an average cost of €145,586.75 per municipality. The total cost of marine litt  er to all coastal municipaliti  es in the UK is therefore in the region of €17,936,000 - €18,780,000. 
Municipaliti  es were asked to break these costs down as far as possible into workforce, materials, collecti  on, 
disposal and administrati  on and 16 municipaliti  es were able to provide detailed informati  on at this level. The

expenditure on beach cleansing by these municipaliti  es amounted to €2,610,100.86 and Table 5.1 shows 
how this is split between categories. 
Category Cost
Disposal €309,970.95
Workforce €1,646,495.33
Materials €185,521.67
Collecti  on €249,202.18
Administrati  on €133,695.51
Total Cost €2,610,100.86
          Table 5.1: Break down of costs to 16 municipaliti  es
For these municipaliti  es, labour costs clearly represented a key area of expenditure and accounted for almost 
two thirds of the total spent on beach cleansing acti  viti  es. On average each municipality spent over €100,000 on workforce costs alone. The costs associated with litt  er collecti  on and disposal were also important, accounti  ng for 10% and 12% of total expenditure respecti  vely as shown in Figure 5.5 below. Expenditure on 
materials and administrati  on of clean ups were both relati  vely low. 
Figure 5.5: Breakdown of the average cost of removing beach litt  er to municipaliti  es
5.2.6.2 Budget allocated to beach cleansingThis project also investi  gated whether the budget allocated by municipaliti  es to beach cleansing was adequate 
to cover their costs. Unfortunately, a lack of data hampered this analysis as only 15 municipaliti  es were able to report both the budget allocated to beach cleansing acti  viti  es and the actual cost of clean ups. In total, the budget for beach cleansing allocated by these municipaliti  es covered 93.5% of their reported costs. This varied substanti  ally between diﬀ  erent municipaliti  es with beach cleansing budgets covering between 60 – 105% of total costs. 39Economic Impacts  of Marine Litt  er
5.2.6.3 Beach cleansing expenditure per head of populati  on and per km
Analysis was undertaken to determine the cost of marine litt  er per head of populati  on and per km of beach 
cleaned. The data relati  ng to costs and distance cleaned was drawn from the questi  onnaires while census data from 2001 was used to provide a reliable populati  on baseline for each municipality.
On average, marine litt  er removal cost €0.85 per person per year but this was highly variable between 
municipaliti  es and ranged from less than €0.01 per person in some municipaliti  es to €3.99 per person in others. Higher per person costs tended to occur where municipaliti  es had responsibility for large areas of coastline or popular tourist beaches which are generally more expensive to keep free of litt  er. 
For 28 municipaliti  es, it was also possible to work out how much beach litt  er removal cost annually per km 
and on average municipaliti  es spent between €7,031.33 and €7,294.82 per km per year removing beach litt  er. There was wide variati  on within this however with beach litt  er removal costi  ng from €171.05 to €82,101.55 per km each year. High per km costs oft  en coincided with more intense beach cleansing operati  ons that focused on regularly removing marine litt  er from small areas of coastline, parti  cularly in tourist areas. 
5.2.6.4 Cost of Litt  er Preventi  on MeasuresWhile municipaliti  es employ a diverse range of litt  er preventi  on measures, this project focused on the costs 
associated with the provision of coastal litt  erbins, as these are one of the most commonly used methods of litt  er preventi  on. Only 27 municipaliti  es were able to provide this informati  on, however, due to diﬃ   culti  es breaking down waste and litt  er preventi  on costs. In total these municipaliti  es spent €159,496.60 per year on the provision of litt  erbins. Expenditure on maintenance amounted to €74,837.85 while the cost of replacement bins was lower at €48,423.16. These ﬁ  ndings are likely to underesti  mate the costs associated with marine litt  er preventi  on as they do not take into account the diverse range of measures, as outlined above, employed by municipaliti  es to tackle litt  ering. 
5.2.6.5 Trends in the economic cost of marine litt  erThis research has been conducted in a broadly similar manner to the project undertaken by Hall in 2000 which 
enables a degree of comparison between the two studies and an insight into how the economic impact of marine litt  er has changed over the last 10 years. Unfortunately, it is not possible to compare the total cost to municipaliti  es reported in each study, as many of the municipaliti  es involved in each project are diﬀ  erent. 
The average cost of beach cleansing acti  viti  es per municipality however has increased by 37.4% over the 
last 10 years, taking into account inﬂ  ati  on. In 2000, beach cleansing cost approximately €87,037.00
5 per 
municipality on average while this project found the current average cost to be €139,043.21 per municipality. Based on these averages, beach cleansing therefore cost municipaliti  es in the UK approximately €11,488,885 in 2000 with municipaliti  es now spending approximately €17,936,000 dealing with marine litt  er.
A small group of 9 municipaliti  es responded to both projects and these results can be used to provide a 
more detailed and direct comparison of changes in beach cleansing expenditure over the last 10 years.  Figure 5.6 overleaf illustrates the percentage change in beach cleansing expenditure experienced by these municipaliti  es between 2000 and 2010. Overall these municipaliti  es have experienced a 38% rise in beach 
5 Hall’s ﬁ  gures have been adjusted for inﬂ  ati  on and converted into Euros.40Economic Impacts of Marine Litt  er
cleansing expenditure, taking into account inﬂ  ati  on, from €1,210,092.32 in 2000 to €1,669,571.36 in 2010. 
This is broadly in line with the increase seen in the average cost of beach cleansing acti  viti  es and further suggests that beach cleansing costs have signiﬁ  cantly increased over the past 10 years.  
There were vast diﬀ  erences, however, in the changes in cost experienced by this group of municipaliti  es with 5 
respondents experiencing increased costs and 4 reporti  ng lower costs than in 2000. The magnitude of change in costs over the last 10 years was also quite dramati  c and ranged from a decrease of 259% experienced by the City of Edinburgh Council to an increase in expenditure on beach cleansing of 270% for Aberdeenshire Council. 
Figure 5.6: Changes in beach cleansing expenditure for municipaliti  es between 2000 and 2010
As part of the current project, all municipaliti  es were asked whether their beach cleansing costs had increased 
in the last few years and the reasons behind the change. Overall, 55.6% of municipaliti  es reported that their costs had increased over the past few years. Municipaliti  es suggested that the increased costs were due to:  
Higher disposal costs including landﬁ  ll taxes• 
Increased need for beach cleansing as a result of rising levels of litt  er• 
Increases in staﬀ   pay and labour costs• 
Inﬂ  ati  on• 
The need to pursue higher standards of beach cleanliness both to meet public expectati  ons and fulﬁ  l • 
the requirements of beach awardsIncreases in the cost of maintenance and fuel for vehicles • 
The cost of implementi  ng legislati  on• 
The need to accommodate and support the increasing number of voluntary groups conducti  ng beach • 
cleans
Several municipaliti  es also highlighted that despite rising costs, they were under considerable pressure to 41Economic Impacts  of Marine Litt  er
reduce expenditure on beach cleansing. One municipality, for example, has stopped pursuing beach awards 
due to budget cutbacks.
5.3 Case study: The Netherlands and Belgium
5.3.1 Beach cleansing
Almost all the municipaliti  es that responded to this questi  onnaire undertook some form of beach cleansing 
with only 1 municipality reporti  ng that it did not operate beach cleans. This municipality did not conduct 
beach cleans because there was no marine debris problem in their area and other organisati  ons cleaned the 
coastline when necessary.
The main reasons identi  ﬁ  ed by municipaliti  es for removing marine litt  er are shown in Figure 5.7 below. The 
most common reason for undertaking beach cleans was to maintain and enhance popular tourist areas and 
92.3% of parti  cipati  ng municipaliti  es carried out beach cleans for this reason. Similarly, the pursuit of Blue 
Flag awards sti  mulated beach cleans in 46.2% of the municipaliti  es surveyed. These results are broadly similar to those from the UK and show that tourism acts as the principle driving force for beach cleaning programs. The inﬂ  uence of legislati  on and statutory requirements was parti  cularly low in the Netherlands and Belgium, however, with only 30.7% of municipaliti  es identi  fying this as a reason they undertook beach clean ups.
Figure 5.7: Reasons why municipaliti  es undertake beach cleans
Municipaliti  es oft  en worked in partnership with other organisati  ons to remove marine litt  er and 61.5% of 
municipaliti  es reported that they received external assistance to run their clean ups. External organisati  ons also operated their own beach cleans without municipality involvement and 69.2% of municipaliti  es reported that independent beach cleans occurred in their areas.42Economic Impacts of Marine Litt  er
5.3.2 Beach characteristi  cs and cleansing regime
Municipaliti  es were asked to identi  fy several key characteristi  cs of the beaches they cleaned and provide 
informati  on about the methods and frequency at which clean up operati  ons occurred. Marine litt  er was only removed from sandy beaches in the Netherlands and Belgium and 69.2% of municipaliti  es were the owners of the beaches where litt  er was removed. The rest were generally owned by the nati  onal government and only one municipality reported that local businesses were responsible for maintaining secti  ons of the coastline in their area. 
A wide spread of beaches were cleansed in terms of usage but municipaliti  es were sti  ll more likely to clean 
more popular beaches. In total, 84.6% of municipaliti  es removed marine litt  er from high usage beaches, 53.9% removed litt  er from medium usage beaches and 23.1% removed litt  er from low-usage beaches. Similar to the UK, the most commonly reported user group of the coastlines where clean ups occurred was tourists with 92.3% of municipaliti  es reporti  ng that this was the case. For just over 75% of municipaliti  es, commercial businesses also represented key users of the coastline in questi  on and a much smaller proporti  on of municipaliti  es also identi  ﬁ  ed commercial ﬁ  sheries as a key user group.
The vast majority of municipaliti  es surveyed used a combinati  on of manual and mechanical cleaning methods. 
This was the case for 76.9% of parti  cipati  ng municipaliti  es and only 1 municipality reported that it used no machinery whatsoever to clean its beaches. The high use of machinery for beach cleansing is possible in the Netherlands and Belgium as the beaches cleaned are generally sandy in nature. This represents a sharp contrast to the UK where beach cleansing is more oft  en carried out manually in order to accommodate the varying nature of the beaches involved.
The frequency of clean up operati  ons oft  en varied to match the season and this made it diﬃ   cult to draw any 
conclusions in terms of how regularly clean ups occurred. Overall, most municipaliti  es operated a variable cleansing regime, removing litt  er on a daily or weekly basis in summer and only as necessary in winter.   
5.3.3 Length of coastline cleaned and weight of litt  er removedThe total length of coastline cleaned by parti  cipati  ng 
municipaliti  es amounted to 68.6km in total spread across 11 municipaliti  es. Each municipality therefore removed marine litt  er from 6.2km of coastline on average. For most of these municipaliti  es, the distance where marine litt  er was removed represented the enti  re length of coastline under their jurisdicti  on. In this respect, municipaliti  es in the Netherlands and Belgium cleansed a much higher proporti  on of the coastline than in the UK. 
Municipaliti  es found it more diﬃ   cult to give details 
about the weight of litt  er they removed from their coastlines and only 6 municipaliti  es were able to provide this data. The quanti  ty of litt  er removed by these municipaliti  es amounted to 724 tonnes in total.

5.3.4 Disposal methods and litt  er preventi  on measures
Municipaliti  es were asked to identi  fy the main methods they uti  lised to dispose of marine litt  er and 12 
were able to provide this informati  on. Municipaliti  es in the Netherlands and Belgium overwhelmingly relied upon incinerators to dispose of the litt  er they collected with 11 reporti  ng that they used this method. One municipality disposed of marine litt  er using a combinati  on of landﬁ  ll and recycling. These ﬁ  gures suggest that the Netherlands and Belgium put less emphasis on recycling marine litt  er than the UK but without a breakdown of the quanti  ti  es of litt  er disposed of using each method, it is diﬃ   cult to determine whether this diﬀ  erence is signiﬁ  cant.
In terms of anti  -litt  er measures, litt  erbins were again the most common method of litt  er preventi  on with all 
but one of the parti  cipati  ng municipaliti  es reporti  ng that they used coastal litt  erbins. 5 municipaliti  es also used noti  ce boards that discouraged litt  ering and promoted responsible waste practi  ces. In additi  on, a small number of municipaliti  es used other litt  er preventi  on methods such as raising public awareness of litt  er issues and control by the police force.
In 2009, 9 municipaliti  es also launched the “Zwerend langs Zee” project in conjuncti  on with KIMO Netherlands 
and Belgium, Rijkswaterstaat and the North Sea Foundati  on. The 2-year project aims to promote the responsible disposal of litt  er by tourists and therefore decrease the amount of litt  er visitors leave at the beach. “Zwerend langs Zee” therefore involves a variety of diﬀ  erent initi  ati  ves such as displaying the amount of litt  er left   behind in a single day, introducing “cleanteams” on the beaches to discuss marine litt  er with tourists, organising free lectures on the theme “The beach is more than sand” and encouraging shopkeepers at the beaches to use more sustainable packaging materials.
5.3.5 Costs of marine litt  er5.3.5.1 Total cost and budget for marine litt  erIn total, 10 municipaliti  es in the Netherlands and Belgium were able to supply ﬁ  gures as regards the total cost 
of removing beach litt  er but very few of these were able to provide a breakdown of these costs. The total cost of beach litt  er removal reported by municipaliti  es was €2,265,415.30 with an average cost of €226,541.53 per municipality per year. Based on this average, removing beach litt  er costs all municipaliti  es in the Netherlands and Belgium a total of €10.4 million per year. 
All the municipaliti  es that reported the cost of removing marine litt  er were also able to provide data about 
the budget allocated to beach cleansing acti  viti  es. The budget reported by these municipaliti  es amounted to €1,816,968 in total and this covered approximately 80% of the costs reported by these municipaliti  es. The ability of the budget to meet the costs involved in removing marine litt  er however varied substanti  ally between municipaliti  es and ranged from 21.5% to 160% of costs reported. Unfortunately, many municipaliti  es that experienced budget deﬁ  cits did not report where the funding to cover these shortf  alls came from. 4 municipaliti  es did receive assistance with their beach cleansing programs but this was oft  en delivered ‘in kind’ in the form of equipment, labour and/or machinery. This support came either from the nati  onal government or from local businesses within the area.
5.3.5.2 Beach cleaning expenditure per kmIn the Netherlands and Belgium, removing beach litt  er cost an average of €34,441.04 per km per year. In 44Economic Impacts of Marine Litt  er
practi  ce, this varied substanti  ally with municipaliti  es experiencing annual costs of between €627.91 and 
€97,346.15 per km for the removal of beach litt  er. Higher costs per km tended to occur in tourist areas where small lengths of beach were cleaned on a regular basis to ensure beaches remained safe and att  racti  ve for visitors.
5.3.5.3 Trends in the economic cost of marine litt  erAs the Netherlands and Belgium were not featured in Hall’s (2000) study, no comparison can be drawn 
between the two sets of ﬁ  ndings. The municipality of Den Haag, however, responded to both projects and  details of this municipality’s approach to marine litt  er is given in 5.3.6 below. Municipaliti  es were also asked as part of the current project whether their costs had increased in the past few years and the reasons behind any change. Overall, 7 out of the 13 municipaliti  es surveyed reported that their beach cleansing costs had increased in the past few years. The reasons given for this included:
Increased labour costs• 
Inﬂ  ati  on• 
More intense use of the beach all year round• 
More litt  er being washed ashore from the sea and more rubbish being dropped by tourists• 
Use of a mechanical cleaner• 
More voluntary clean up operati  ons and increasing number of people becoming involved in clean ups • 
resulti  ng in more litt  er being collected
5.3.6 Den Haag
The municipality of Den Haag in the Netherlands is responsible for a 13km stretch of coastline divided into 
the North and South beaches. The municipality cleans both beaches due to statutory requirements and because they are popular with tourists and easily accessible. These beaches are cleaned daily during the high season (May to October) using both mechanical and manual methods. The weight of debris collected can be highly variable and all litt  er removed is incinerated. Litt  er preventi  on measures uti  lised by the municipality include litt  erbins and a communicati  ons campaign beach team.
The total cost of Den Haag’s beach cleansing program is an esti  mated €1,265,500 which is the highest cost 
reported by any municipality in this project. Removing marine litt  er therefore costs each person in Den Haag an esti  mated €2.64, although Den Haag’s budget for beach cleansing covers only 75% of the total costs. Den Haag also experiences a relati  vely high per km cost of €97,346.15 per km per year due to the need to repeatedly clean small areas of beach to ensure they remain att  racti  ve to tourists. While Den Haag reported that its beach cleansing costs have remained stati  c in the past few years, comparison with Hall’s research
6 
reveals that expenditure on beach cleansing has risen in real terms by approximately 83.2% over the last 10 years. 
5.4 Additi  onal Informati  onIn several countries, only a few responses from municipaliti  es were received and a brief summary of these 
questi  onnaires is provided in Table 5.2 overleaf.

5.5 Conclusion
For most municipaliti  es, the potenti  al economic impact of marine litt  er, parti  cularly in terms of lost tourist 
revenue, provides the principal moti  vati  on for removing beach litt  er. In this respect, regularly removing beach 
litt  er represents a lower cost to municipaliti  es than the potenti  al reducti  on in revenue that would result from 
taking no acti  on. It is also striking that the potenti  al economic impact of marine litt  er provides a much more 
powerful incenti  ve for removing marine litt  er than current legislati  on and statutory requirements, parti  cularly 
in the UK.
Coastal municipaliti  es in the UK spend approximately €18 million each year removing beach litt  er with an 
average cost of €139,000 per municipality. Over the past 10 years, the average cost of removing beach litt  er 
has also increased by 37.4%. Given the considerable pressure to reduce expenditure, municipaliti  es are 
ﬁ  nding it increasingly diﬃ   cult to balance limited budgets with increasing demand for service provision. It is 
also clear that in this case the polluter does not pay, as municipaliti  es must ﬁ  nd the resources and funds to 
deal with litt  er caused by other parti  es. Similarly, it is important to acknowledge that although the repeated 
beach clean-up eﬀ  orts reduce the amount of litt  er on the shore in the short-term, they do not directly address 
the underlying problem.
In the Netherlands and Belgium, coastal municipaliti  es spend a total of €10.4 million each year removing 
beach litt  er. The highest costs are experienced in the municipality of Den Haag, which spent an esti  mated 
€1,265,000 removing beach litt  er in 2008. Although tourism provides the main moti  vati  on for removing 
beach litt  er, it is of parti  cular concern that almost 40% of municipaliti  es in the Netherlands and Belgium 
removed beach litt  er because it threatened local business interests. 
While the challenges involved in dealing with marine litt  er vary from municipality to municipality, the ﬁ  ndings 
outlined here suggest that marine litt  er conti  nues to pose signiﬁ  cant issues for municipaliti  es throughout the 
Northeast Atlanti  c region. With many of the areas cleaned by municipaliti  es popular with tourists, more 
acti  on is required to understand why people litt  er and develop ways to positi  vely inﬂ  uence their behaviour. The “Zwerend langs Zee” project in the Netherlands and Belgium is a good example of joint acti  on to reduce the amount of marine litt  er visitors leave at the beach. The project involves a variety of initi  ati  ves designed 
to change tourists’ atti   tudes to litt  er and also aims to develop examples of best practi  ce to share with other 
municipaliti  es.
There are a number of other initi  ati  ves which could also help to reduce the amount of litt  er visitors leave 
at the beach and several of these are already in operati  on in some countries. The introducti  on of a deposit 
scheme on drinks packaging in Denmark, Germany and Malta, for example, has been used to encourage 
recycling. Similarly, the tax on plasti  c bags in Ireland has reduced the number of bags issued by 90% (Ten 
Brink et al 2009). More work is required to assess the potenti  al of these schemes on a larger scale and develop methods for stakeholders to easily share informati  on and examples of best practi  ce to prevent litt  er. The development of new funding mechanisms for beach-cleaning programmes, which respect the polluter 
pays principle, would also increase the capacity of municipaliti  es to deal with marine46Economic Impacts of Marine Litt  er

6. UK Voluntary Organisati  ons
6.1 Introducti  on
Voluntary organisati  ons play a key role in 
removing litt  er from around the coast and raising public awareness of marine litt  er issues. These organisati  ons range from small community groups dedicated to beach cleaning to large umbrella organisati  ons that focus on diverse marine and coastal issues. Several nati  onal campaigns have also been set up to tackle marine litt  er issues including the Beachwatch and Adopt-a-Beach schemes, operated by the Marine Conservati  on Society (MCS), and the Return To Oﬀ  ender campaign organised by Surfers Against Sewage (SAS).
The primary economic impact of marine litt  er 
on voluntary groups is the cost of running beach cleans in terms of operati  onal expenditure, ﬁ  nancial assistance and the value of volunteers’ ti  me. A questi  onnaire was developed to ﬁ  nd out more about voluntary beach cleansing initi  ati  ves and this was distributed to voluntary organisati  ons within the UK.  
6.2 Volunteer involvement and distance cleanedThe voluntary groups surveyed during this project varied greatly in size and the number of volunteers involved 
in each group ranged from 1 to 4125 people. In total, between 6219 and 6753 volunteers took part in beach cleans organised by the voluntary groups surveyed in this project. These groups carried out beach cleans at various frequencies ranging from daily ti  dy ups to annual clean up events.
The length of coastline over which marine litt  er was removed was similarly variable for these organisati  ons 
and ranged from just 20m to over 1000km. Many of the distances recorded are relati  vely small, reﬂ  ecti  ng the involvement of these groups in the Beachwatch and Adopt-a-Beach schemes. Several of the larger organisati  ons were unable to provide ﬁ  gures about the distances cleaned, as this was generally not recorded by the voluntary groups they supported. 
6.3 Quanti  ty of litt  er collected and disposalThe voluntary organisati  ons surveyed during this project reported the quanti  ty of beach litt  er they removed 
either in terms of weight or the number of refuse sacks collected. 15 parti  cipati  ng groups recorded the weight of litt  er removed during their beach cleans and this amounted to 71.5 to 73.1 tonnes in total. In eﬀ  ect, therefore, each volunteer taking part in these beach cleans removed between 12.8kg and 14.3kg of beach litt  er on average.
Figure 6.1: Public beach clean organised by the Isles of Scilly Area of 
Outstanding Natural Beauty.  Photography: Clare Lewis.48Economic Impacts of Marine Litt  er
Another 9 organisati  ons recorded the number of refuse sacks collected by their volunteers and a total of 1,851 
refuse sacks of beach litt  er were removed by these groups.  On average, therefore, each volunteer involved in these beach cleans removed 1.7 refuse sacks of beach litt  er. Volunteers also encountered a number of large items of marine litt  er including an armchair, ﬁ  sh boxes, oil drums and several complete ﬁ  shing nets. 
The opti  ons for the disposal of marine litt  er include incinerati  on, landﬁ  ll or recycling and 22 voluntary groups 
were able to provide details of how they disposed of the litt  er they collected. In total, 83.3% of these groups sent the litt  er they collected to landﬁ  ll and 45.8% recycled marine litt  er. A small minority of voluntary groups disposed of their litt  er using incinerati  on with just 8.3% of organisati  ons using this method. Two organisati  ons were unsure about what happened to the litt  er they collected as the municipality disposed of it on their behalf.
6.4 Economic cost of marine litt  er6.4.1 External assistanceAmong the voluntary groups surveyed, 54.2% received some form of assistance from external organisati  ons 
and agencies. Municipaliti  es were the main providers of support and ﬁ  nancial assistance with 86.7% of voluntary groups receiving help from this source. A small number of groups also received assistance from private businesses and through sponsorship.
Direct ﬁ  nancial assistance from external 
organisati  ons was received by 5 organisati  ons and this amounted to       € 13,273.25 per year. Another 9 groups received support in the form of ‘in kind’ assistance, which included:
Supplies and materials such • 
as gloves, tabards, refuse sacks and litt  er pickersStaﬀ   to supervise the beach • 
cleansLiability insurance• 
Collecti  on and transportati  on • 
of litt  er to disposal faciliti  esDisposal of litt  er including • 
the associated landﬁ  ll tax
6.4.2 Cost of volunteers’ ti  me
Voluntary groups were asked to esti  mate either the amount of money it would take to pay manual workers 
to do the same job or the number of hours their volunteers spent on beach cleans over the course of a year. Many voluntary groups, parti  cularly larger organisati  ons, found this diﬃ   cult as they do not usually record these details and therefore only 9 organisati  ons were able to esti  mate the value of their volunteers’ ti  me. Volunteers from these organisati  ons spent a total of 13,228 hours over the course of a year removing marine 
Figure 6.2: Beach clean conducted by volunteers from 824 Squadron, RAF Culdrose.

litt  er from beaches. These hours are equal to € 84,579.34 in labour costs to pay manual workers to do the 
same job at the Briti  sh minimum wage.
6.4.3 Total cost of voluntary initi  ati  ves 
Overall, 10 voluntary organisati  ons were able to provide data about the costs associated with their beach 
cleans. For these groups, the total cost of voluntary clean ups amounts to €97,852.59 and Figure 6.3 below shows how these costs are divided between direct ﬁ  nancial assistance and volunteer ti  me. The cost to pay 
manual workers to do the same job is relati  vely high and in eﬀ  ect each volunteer involved in these groups 
contributes the equivalent of €16.23 of their ti  me on average each year. In reality, the full cost of voluntary clean ups is likely to be substanti  ally higher as this analysis does not include the administrati  ve costs involved in organising beach cleans or the cost of in kind support and assistance provided by external organisati  ons.
Figure 6.3: Breakdown of the average cost of marine litt  er to voluntary organisati  ons
On a broader scale, it is diﬃ   cult to calculate the total cost of voluntary clean up eﬀ  orts due to the sheer 
diversity and widespread nature of these groups. However, esti  mati  ng the contributi  on volunteers make to some of the big voluntary clean up initi  ati  ves in the UK gives some indicati  on of the cost of these eﬀ  orts. Within the UK, the MCS Beachwatch scheme and Keep Scotland Beauti  ful’s (KSB) Nati  onal Spring Clean both remove a substanti  al quanti  ty of litt  er from around the UK coastline and a total of 8,809 adult volunteers were involved in the most recent events held by these organisati  ons. Volunteers involved in these events therefore contribute the equivalent of € 131,287.47
7 of their ti  me on average each year. Given the high 
7 In 2009, MCS Beachwatch volunteers spent a total of 9,995 volunteer hours removing beach litt  er at a cost of €63,868.05 at 
the Briti  sh minimum wage. In 2010, coastal clean ups held under the KSB Nati  onal Spring Clean banner involved 4,154 adult 
volunteers but unfortunately the number of volunteer hours is unknown. However, applying the average cost of ti  me contributed by volunteers surveyed during this project (€16.23) suggests that these volunteers contributed the equivalent of approximately €67,419.42 of their ti  me. In total, therefore, volunteers contributed the equivalent of €131,287.47 of their ti  me to these events.50Economic Impacts of Marine Litt  er
level of volunteer involvement in removing beach litt  er in the UK, these ﬁ  gures suggest that the full cost of 
voluntary beach litt  er removal in the UK is likely to be signiﬁ  cant.
6.5 Conclusion
Voluntary organisati  ons clearly make a signiﬁ  cant and extremely positi  ve contributi  on to ensuring the UK’s 
coastline remains clean and litt  er free. With each volunteer contributi  ng €16.23 on average of their ti  me 
each year, the full economic cost of voluntary involvement in removing beach litt  er is likely to be substanti  al. 
Indeed, the 8,809 volunteers involved in the most recent MCS Beachwatch and KSB Nati  onal Spring Clean 
campaigns contributed approximately € 131,287.47 of their ti  me to removing beach litt  er. In reality, the full 
cost of voluntary clean ups is likely to be substanti  ally higher as this analysis does not include the administrati  ve 
costs involved in organising beach cleans or the cost of in kind support and assistance provided by external 
organisati  ons. It is also important to acknowledge that while these repeated beach cleans reduce the amount 
of litt  er on the shore in the short-term, they do not directly address the underlying problem.
Although volunteers contribute their ti  me for free, most voluntary groups oft  en seek small grants from 
external bodies to cover operati  ng costs such as equipment for volunteers and administrati  ve costs. Within 
the current ﬁ  nancial climate, however, voluntary groups are ﬁ  nding it increasingly diﬃ   cult to source the 
external funding necessary to support their work and it is therefore unclear whether some groups will be 
able to conti  nue in their present form.
While this project has focused on the UK, countless voluntary groups around the world are involved in similar 
acti  viti  es aimed at reducing the amount of litt  er in the marine and coastal environment. More research is 
required to fully account for the eﬀ  orts of these organisati  ons and ensure that voluntary acti  on does not 
mask the true cost of marine litt  er. 51Economic Impacts  of Marine Litt  er
7. UK Tourism
7.1 Introducti  on
Tourism is one of the UK’s largest industries and directly accounts for approximately 3.7% of nati  onal GDP 
(Deloitt  e 2008). Coastal tourism, in parti  cular, contributes between €7 billion (Tourism Alliance 2007) and 
€11 billion (Deloitt  e 2008) to the UK economy each year. For visitors to the coastline, beach cleanliness is a 
key priority when choosing where to visit (ENCAMS 2005) and the presence of marine litt  er can therefore 
act as a deterrent to tourists (Ballance et al 2000). Marine litt  er can consequently have a negati  ve eﬀ  ect on 
tourism revenue and weaken coastal economies. A questi  onnaire was developed to investi  gate the eﬀ  ects of 
marine litt  er on tourism and this questi  onnaire was distributed to tourist authoriti  es within the UK.
7.2 Coastal visitors and tourist revenue
A total of 8 local and regional tourist organisati  ons were able to provide ﬁ  gures regarding the number of 
tourists visiti  ng their area. They recorded approximately 39.4 million visitors to their areas, of which between 
16.5 and 17.4 million visited the area speciﬁ  cally to go to the beach or coastline. The percentage of tourists speciﬁ  cally att  racted by the beach or coastline varied signiﬁ  cantly between areas and ranged from 18% to 90% of total visitors to an area. Any drop in cleanliness standards could therefore result in a serious decline in tourist numbers.
For the 5 organisati  ons that provided ﬁ  gures, tourism generated an esti  mated € 3.4 billion in their areas and, 
assuming visitors spend the same regardless of the att  racti  on, tourists therefore spend € 1.8 billion while visiti  ng coastal locati  ons. Clearly any reducti  on in tourist revenue due to marine litt  er could have a detrimental eﬀ  ect on coastal economies, parti  cularly as tourism oft  en makes a disproporti  onately high contributi  on to coastal economies (Deloitt  e 2008; Visit Wales 2008).  
7.3 Awards and ComplaintsWithin the UK, various awards schemes have been developed to recognise beaches that are managed to a 
high standard. These include:
Blue Flag Awards. These are judged according to recognised standards in terms of safety, water • 
quality, cleanliness and faciliti  es. Throughout the UK, 122 beaches have successfully achieved Blue Flag Awards in 2010.Quality Coast Awards. This scheme operates only in England and aims to raise standards at the coast. • 
A total of 111 Quality Coast Awards have been presented in 2010.Green Coast Awards. This initi  ati  ve was developed to recognise more remote rural beaches in Wales • 
and Ireland that are managed to a high standard and meet the guideline standards for bathing water. During the 2010 season, a record 50 beaches in Wales achieved Green Coast Awards.Seaside Awards. This scheme is split into two categories, resort and rural beaches, and operates • 
in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It recognises beaches that meet mandatory water quality standards and are clean, safe and well managed. In 2010, a total of 173 beaches met the criteria for Seaside Awards.
In this project, 10 out of the 16 tourist authoriti  es surveyed reported that beaches in their area held at least one type of award. Among this group, Blue Flag Awards were the most commonly held type of award closely 52Economic Impacts of Marine Litt  er
followed by Quality Coast Awards.
All the tourist organisati  ons surveyed during this project reported that complaints about marine litt  er and 
rubbish on the beach were extremely rare. Altogether, these organisati  ons had only received 13 complaints about marine litt  er in total with tourists more likely to switch to other desti  nati  ons rather than complain. Reports of illness and injuries resulti  ng from marine litt  er were similarly rare and in most cases these were minor incidents that generally go unrecorded. 
7.4 Importance of a clean and high quality coastal environment to tourism brandingThe tourist organisati  ons surveyed during this project agreed that a clean and high quality coastal environment 
was important or very important for tourism branding. For many areas, the coast is the principal att  racti  on for tourists and therefore ensuring it remains att  racti  ve, clean and safe is criti  cally important. As one parti  cipant stated, “visitors and locals alike want to visit unspoiled coastal sites and appreciate the beauty there. They don’t want to be confronted with rubbish strewn across the landscape.” 
Public percepti  ons of the cleanliness and quality of a beach were also very important with several tourist 
organisati  ons suggesti  ng that bad visitor experiences would damage their branding positi  on as a clean and high quality desti  nati  on. Several organisati  ons therefore felt it was important to acti  vely demonstrate to prospecti  ve visitors that their beaches were managed to a high standard, generally through parti  cipati  on in awards schemes and initi  ati  ves such as the Blue Flag Awards.
Parti  cipants also highlighted the potenti  al economic impact of a reducti  on in tourism due to marine litt  er. A 
parti  cipant stated, “The coastline/beaches is the main reason visitors choose to visit this area and with an industry worth more than £1 billion then anything which aﬀ  ects this would be hugely detrimental.” Ensuring visitors have a positi  ve experience at the beach is also a key part of encouraging repeat visits to the area. 
One organisati  on stated that “visitors are 
att  racted to a clean beach and a beach 
is remembered for the cleanliness, 
resulti  ng in repeat visits to the 
area. We also have a lot of water 
sports, such as surﬁ  ng and kite 
surﬁ  ng on our coastline, this would be hugely aﬀ  ected if the water and beach area were not clean.” 
As a result, the vast majority of 
organisati  ons surveyed believed that only natural debris such as seaweed was acceptable in the marine and coastal environment; all man-made litt  er is unnecessary and unacceptable. Several 
organisati  ons, however, felt that litt  er was nearly impossible to control.

beaches are managed to a high standard. Image: Keep Scotland Beauti  ful.53Economic Impacts  of Marine Litt  er
7.5 Litt  er preventi  on and removal campaigns
Tourist authoriti  es were keenly aware that the tourism industry itself results in a signiﬁ  cant amount of litt  er 
entering the marine environment and many of these organisati  ons therefore acti  vely worked both to prevent and remove litt  er from the coastline in their areas. These acti  viti  es included:
Visible beach cleansing operati  ons, numerous bins and signage promoti  ng responsible waste • 
practi  cesPromoti  on of responsible behaviour in publicati  ons and on the organisati  on’s website such as the •

groups and forumsSharing best practi  ce with other organisati  ons through the United Kingdom Beach Managers Forum •

7.6 Conclusion
For many areas, the clean and unspoiled coastline is the principal att  racti  on for tourists. From the ﬁ  ndings 
presented in this chapter, it is clear that marine litt  er can threaten the image and reputati  on of an area and potenti  ally lead to a decline in the number of tourists visiti  ng the area. This could have a signiﬁ  cant negati  ve impact on tourism revenue and the local economy as a whole, parti  cularly as tourism tends to make a disproporti  onately large contributi  on to coastal economies (Deloitt  e 2008). It is also important to remember that the direct costs of removing beach litt  er tend to be borne by municipaliti  es rather than tourist organisati  ons.
There is now a pressing need for more 
research, similar to that conducted by Ballance et al (2000), to determine at what level marine litt  er acts as a deterrent to tourists. This is parti  cularly important given that tourist authoriti  es receive relati  vely few complaints about marine litt  er with tourists more likely to switch to other desti  nati  ons rather than complain. Many tourist authoriti  es have therefore put in place numerous measures to both acti  vely demonstrate to visitors how clean their coastline is and minimise the amount of marine litt  er generated by tourists in their area.

8. Sea Fisheries
8.1 Introducti  on
Sea ﬁ  sheries are extremely 
important to many coastal communiti  es throughout the Northeast Atlanti  c region and they conti  nue to provide a key source of income and employment, especially in areas where other economic opportuniti  es are scarce. The ﬁ  shing industry is oft  en highlighted as a source of marine litt  er but less att  enti  on has been paid to the negati  ve impact marine litt  er has on ﬁ  shing vessels and the industry as a whole (OSPAR 2009). Marine litt  er aﬀ  ects the ﬁ  shing industry in a variety of ways, which can result in both additi  onal costs and reduced revenue for ﬁ  shing vessels. This project focuses on the economic impacts associated with marine litt  er which include:
Repairing damage to ﬁ  shing gear and the vessel• 
Replacement of lost gear• 
Reduced and/or contaminated catch• 
Loss of earnings due to reduced ﬁ  shing ti  me• 
A questi  onnaire was developed to investi  gate how marine litt  er aﬀ  ects ﬁ  shing vessels and the associated costs of dealing with it. These questi  onnaires were distributed to ﬁ  shing vessels in countries throughout the Northeast Atlanti  c region.
8.2 Scotti   sh ﬁ  shing vessels8.2.1 Introducti  onDespite restructuring over the past decade, the Scotti   sh ﬁ  shing industry remains one of the largest in Europe 
and many coastal communiti  es throughout Scotland rely on ﬁ  shing for their livelihoods. In 2008, the Scotti   sh ﬂ  eet landed approximately 371,000 tonnes of ﬁ  sh with a commercial value of £396 million. Over 5,400 people are employed in the catching sector (Scotti   sh Government 2009a) with another 5,250 employed in the onshore ﬁ  sh processing industry (Scotti   sh Government 2009b). 
This project aimed to investi  gate the extent to which marine litt  er aﬀ  ects the ﬁ  shing industry in Scotland 
and the associated economic costs of dealing with it. The vast majority of questi  onnaire responses received came from twin and single rig trawlers but responses were also received from scallopers, seine nett  ers and pair trawlers. 
Figure 8.1: Marine litt  er can result in numerous problems and high costs for ﬁ  shing 
vessels. Image: David Linkie.55Economic Impacts  of Marine Litt  er
8.2.2 Common types of litt  er and worst areas
Fishermen were asked to identi  fy the types of litt  er that commonly accumulate in their hauls and the results 
are shown in Figure 8.2 below. The most common type of litt  er was rope closely followed by plasti  c with over 90% of ﬁ  shermen experiencing these types of litt  er accumulati  ng in their nets. Bott  les, wire, derelict ﬁ  shing nets and tyres were also very common and over 70% of ﬁ  shermen found these types of debris in their hauls. Fishing vessels had also encountered a wide range of other types of debris including:
Oil and fuel ﬁ  lters• 
Tins of paint and grease• 
Debris from oil related acti  viti  es • 
Foreign gill nets• 
Washing machines• 
Cars• 
Figure 8.2: Most common types of litt  er accumulati  ng in hauls
Fishermen were also asked to identi  fy the “worst area” for collecti  ng or snagging marine litt  er in their nets 
but it quickly became apparent that there is no single “worst area” for litt  er. Fishing vessels can experience problems with marine litt  er wherever they are, although a small number of vessels speciﬁ  cally reported problems near areas of recent oil related acti  vity. One vessel suggested that “80% of torn and damaged gear, and lost nets is due to oil debris”.
8.2.3 Impact on catch and damage to netsMarine litt  er can restrict the amount vessels catch by accumulati  ng in their nets during hauls and this aﬀ  ected 
approximately 86% of vessels surveyed during this project. As one vessel reported “Plasti  cs in my net restrict 56Economic Impacts of Marine Litt  er
my trawl ﬁ  shing to its full potenti  al, as the cod-ends ﬁ  ll up with silt quickly. This then alters the geometry 
of the twin trawl resulti  ng in a poor trawl tow”. Several ﬁ  shermen also commented that they were now experiencing less litt  er on the ﬁ  shing grounds than in past years due to the Fishing for Litt  er project, which 
acti  vely removes litt  er from the seas around Scotland.
Various types of marine litt  er can also contaminate a vessel’s catch resulti  ng in the ﬁ  sh having to be dumped, 
additi  onal costs to clean the vessel and equipment, and lost ﬁ  shing ti  me. Approximately 82% of vessels 
surveyed had discarded ﬁ  sh due to contaminati  on with one vessel reporti  ng that it had to “dump three boxes 
of prawns last trip due to paint”. Every boat that had experienced a contaminated catch identi  ﬁ  ed paint as 
a cause with 88% also reporti  ng that oil ﬁ  lters have fouled their catch. A small number of vessels had also 
experienced problems with grease and detergents. Contaminati  on incidents could occur quite regularly with 
some vessels experiencing as many as one incident per month. 
Over 95% of vessels had snagged their nets on debris on the seabed, although it is not always possible to 
identi  fy whether this debris is natural or man-made. Fishermen commented that debris from oil related 
acti  viti  es and old wires on the seabed were parti  cular problems in terms of damaging nets.
8.2.4 Incidents involving marine litt  er
Marine litt  er can pose navigati  onal hazards for ﬁ  shing vessels and potenti  ally result in vessel damage. The 
types of incidents involving marine litt  er include fouled propellers, fouled anchors, fouled rudders and blocked 
intake pipes and valves. For many vessels, it was diﬃ   cult to esti  mate the number of incidents that occur in a 
year but only 4 vessels reported that they had experienced no incidents with marine debris in the last year.
For the 18 vessels that had experienced incidents with marine litt  er, fouled propellers were generally the 
most common type of incident closely followed by blocked intake pipes and valves. Only one vessel had 
experienced a fouled rudder and no vessels reported having fouled their anchor on marine litt  er.
In terms of speciﬁ  c ﬁ  gures, 7 vessels were able to provide data about the number of incidents involving 
marine litt  er they had experienced over the course of a year. These vessels reported 20 incidents in total 
including 6 fouled propellers and 14 cases of blocked intake pipes or valves. On average therefore each vessel 
parti  cipati  ng in the project experienced just under 1 incident per year involving marine litt  er.
8.2.5 Economic cost of marine litt  er to ﬁ  shing vessels
This project concentrated on the direct economic impact of marine litt  er on ﬁ  shing vessels including:
The value of dumped catch• 
The cost of repairs to ﬁ  shing gear and nets• 
The overall cost of fouling incidents• 
9
Lost earnings as a result of reduced ﬁ  shing ti  me due to clearing litt  er from nets• 10
On average, marine litt  er costs each ﬁ  shing vessel in the Scotti   sh ﬁ  shing ﬂ  eet between €17,219 and €19,165

10 Calculated using the average value of one hour’s ﬁ  shing ti  me as esti  mated by vessels surveyed during this project. 57Economic Impacts  of Marine Litt  er
each year and Figure 8.3 below shows how this is split on average between diﬀ  erent categories. The loss of 
ﬁ  shing ti  me incurred due to clearing nets of marine litt  er accounts for the majority of costs experienced by ﬁ  shing vessels as a result of marine litt  er. On average, each vessel spends 41 hours per year clearing litt  er from their nets at a cost of approximately €12,000
11. With conti  nuing European restricti  ons on the number 
of days ﬁ  shing vessels can spend at sea, lost ﬁ  shing ti  me due to marine litt  er is a cost few ﬁ  shing vessels can aﬀ  ord.
The relati  vely low average cost incurred due to fouling incidents reﬂ  ects the overall infrequency of these 
events across the ﬁ  shing ﬂ  eet. It is also important to note that the economic impact of an incident involving marine litt  er is highly dependent upon how good the ﬁ  shing is when an incident occurs. As one ﬁ  sherman put it, this can result in virtually no cost if the ﬁ  shing is poor but “a hell of a lot of money” if the ﬁ  shing is good.

Figure 8.3: Breakdown of the average cost of marine litt  er to Scotti   sh ﬁ  shing vessels
The economic impact of marine litt  er on ﬁ  shing vessels can clearly be substanti  al and represents an additi  onal 
burden on an industry already under pressure. Based on the average ﬁ  gures, marine litt  er costs the Scotti   sh ﬁ  shing industry between €11.7 million and €13 million each year
12. Marine litt  er therefore reduces the 
revenue generated by aﬀ  ected ﬁ  sheries by up to 5% per year13.
11 Calculated using the average value of one hour’s ﬁ  shing ti  me as esti  mated by vessels surveyed during this project. 
12 Calculated using the average cost of marine litt  er per vessel and the number of vessels involved in aﬀ  ected ﬁ  sheries. Number 
of vessels in aﬀ  ected ﬁ  sheries taken from Table 5 of Scotti   sh Government (2009a): demersal (355 vessels), nephrops trawl (274 
vessels), mechanical dredging (91 vessels) and sucti  on dredging (3 vessels). Total of 678 vessels in aﬀ  ected ﬁ  sheries.
13 Calculated based on the average cost of marine litt  er to all vessels in aﬀ  ected ﬁ  sheries as a percentage of the value of landings 
for these ﬁ  sheries. Value of landings for aﬀ  ected ﬁ  sheries taken from Table 30 of Scotti   sh Government (2009a): demersal 
(£139,416,000), nephrops (£91,287,000) and scallops (£28,485,000). Total value of landings in aﬀ  ected ﬁ  sheries: £259,188,000. Converted to Euros: €272,112,428.02.58Economic Impacts of Marine Litt  er
In general, very few vessels received any assistance to cover costs incurred due to marine litt  er. Only 27% of 
vessels have claimed insurance for incidents involving marine litt  er and just 9% had claimed income support. Many vessels also commented that it was very diﬃ   cult to get compensati  on for incidents involving oil related debris as it is quite challenging to provide the evidence necessary to support a claim.
8.2.6 Working practi  cesThe ﬁ  shermen surveyed during this project acknowledged that ﬁ  shing vessels do contribute to marine litt  er 
with one ﬁ  sherman stati  ng, “A lot of beach litt  er is coming from ﬁ  shing vessels dumping their rubbish on the way to ﬁ  shing grounds”. The ﬁ  shing industry overall however has adopted a number of positi  ve measures to tackle marine litt  er and reduce its environmental impact. 
All the vessels surveyed had signed 
up to the Fishing For Litt  er scheme, which acti  vely removes marine litt  er from the seas. Several ﬁ  shermen commented that they were already seeing the positi  ve eﬀ  ects of this project since “ﬁ  shing grounds do appear to have less debris on them as we are not seeing the same amounts of plasti  cs etc”. Over 77% of the vessels surveyed were also members of a responsible ﬁ  shing scheme, which includes commitments to prevent and remove marine litt  er. 
8.3 Portuguese ﬁ  shing vesselsSince most of the Portuguese vessels surveyed used long-lines rather than nets, they encountered very few 
problems with marine litt  er aﬀ  ecti  ng their catch. Therefore, only 29% of vessels had experienced a restricted catch due to marine litt  er and 38% had experienced a contaminated catch, which was caused by oil ﬁ  lters in all cases. 
In terms of incidents, only 4 Portuguese vessels had sustained no incidents involving marine litt  er whatsoever. 
Fouled propellers were the most common type of incident with 12 vessels sustaining at least one fouled propeller per year. These vessels recorded a total of 19 fouled propellers per year, which is signiﬁ  cantly higher than the number reported by Scotti   sh vessels. A further 5 Portuguese vessels reported that they experienced fouled propellers approximately once every ﬁ  ve years.
Blocked intake pipes and valves were much less common than in the Scotti   sh ﬂ  eet with only 4 Portuguese 
vessels experiencing one or more blocked intake pipes or valves per year. Just one vessel had fouled its rudder on marine litt  er in the past year and fouled anchors were extremely rare with only one incident of this 
Figure 8.4: Full bags of marine litt  er deposited by vessels involved in the Fishing 
for Litt  er South West scheme. Image: Sarah Crosbie59Economic Impacts  of Marine Litt  er
type occurring in the past 20 years. Overall, the Portuguese vessels surveyed experienced 1.1 incidents per 
vessel per year on average, slightly above the incidence rate for Scotti   sh vessels.
The economic impact of marine litt  er upon Portuguese vessels was on average relati  vely low, parti  cularly 
in comparison to the Scotti   sh ﬁ  gures. Marine litt  er cost each Portuguese vessel €2,930 per year on average and over 80% of these costs related to fouled propellers. Indeed, fouled propellers could cost as much as €15,000 per incident. Although repairing nets makes up only 18% of the average cost, this is relati  vely high considering the small number of vessels using a net-based approach. Despite high costs for individual vessels, 
the average cost of marine litt  er appears quite low, as these problems seem to aﬀ  ect only a small proporti  on 
of the Portuguese ﬂ  eet.  
Portuguese vessels were oft  en successful in claiming insurance to cover the cost of incidents with 81% of 
vessels reporti  ng this to be the case. The number of vessels able to claim income support was also slightly 
higher than in Scotland and 19% of vessels had been able to do so in the event of an incident. Just under half 
of the vessels surveyed were also involved in a responsible ﬁ  shing scheme.
8.4 Spanish Fishing Vessels
A total of 6 responses were received from Spanish ﬁ  shing vessels and all of these vessels ﬁ  shed within the 
Mediterranean Sea. These responses came from trawlers and vessels using seine nets. While representi  ng only a small sample, the Spanish vessels surveyed experienced broadly similar problems with marine litt  er to those occurring in Scotland. 
All the vessels surveyed had experienced a restricted catch due to marine litt  er accumulati  ng in their nets 
and plasti  c, parti  cularly plasti  c bott  les, was the most common type of debris. Marine litt  er had contaminated the catch of 3 vessels with paint the most common cause, although grease and oil ﬁ  lters also proved to be a problem. Virtually all the vessels surveyed had snagged their nets on debris on the seabed.
Every vessel surveyed had experienced at least one incident involving marine litt  er but only 3 vessels were able 
to report how oft  en this occurred per year. These vessels had experienced 1 fouled propeller and 3 blocked intake pipes or valves in the past year. With minimal data, it is not possible to determine the economic cost of these incidents. All of the vessels surveyed were also signed up to a responsible ﬁ  shing scheme.
8.5 ConclusionThe ﬁ  ndings presented in this chapter clearly show that marine litt  er poses numerous and widespread issues 
for the ﬁ  shing industry. Of the Scotti   sh vessels that responded, 86% had experienced a restricted catch due to marine litt  er, 82% had had their catch contaminated and 95% had snagged their nets on debris on the seabed. Incidents such as fouled propellers and blocked intake pipes were also relati  vely common with an average of just under 1 incident reported per vessel per year. 
Although subject to variability depending on the quality of ﬁ  shing, it is also clear that marine litt  er results in 
high costs both to individual ﬁ  shing vessels and to the industry as a whole. Marine litt  er costs the Scotti   sh ﬁ  shing industry €11.7 - €13 million each year, which is the equivalent of up to 5% of the total revenue of aﬀ  ected ﬁ  sheries. Given the conti  nuing restricti  ons on the number of days ﬁ  shing vessels can spend at sea, the large amount of lost ﬁ  shing ti  me due to marine litt  er is an area of parti  cular concern.60Economic Impacts of Marine Litt  er
Vessels surveyed during this project also acknowledged that the ﬁ  shing industry is both a source and a victi  m 
of marine litt  er. Within Scotland, plasti  cs and rope were the most common types of litt  er encountered by ﬁ  shing vessels and oil industry debris conti  nued to pose signiﬁ  cant problems. The ﬁ  shing industry is also making a considerable eﬀ  ort to reduce marine litt  er by both preventi  ng litt  er entering the marine environment and removing existi  ng marine litt  er through the Fishing for Litt  er scheme. 
While the impacts of marine litt  er are variable, case studies from Portugal and Spain demonstrate that 
marine litt  er can cause widespread problems for ﬁ  shing vessels. Fouled propellers posed the main issues for Portuguese vessels and although individual incidents could be very costly, the average cost of marine litt  er per vessel was relati  vely low as only a small proporti  on of the vessels surveyed were aﬀ  ected. Although the small group of Spanish vessels surveyed ﬁ  shed in the Mediterranean Sea, they experienced fairly similar problems with marine litt  er to those reported by the Scotti   sh ﬂ  eet in the Northeast Atlanti  c. 
Marine litt  er poses numerous issues for ﬁ  shing vessels and there are a number of acti  ons the industry could take 
to reduce its own contributi  on to marine litt  er. In parti  cular, environmental awareness training, incorporati  ng marine litt  er issues, for all professional ﬁ  shermen could be implemented and made compulsory. Port waste recepti  on faciliti  es regulati  ons could also be expanded to include ﬁ  shing vessels, which are currently exempt, in order to monitor waste disposal and deter illegal discharges at sea. In additi  on, Scotti   sh ﬁ  shermen are ﬁ  nding less litt  er on their ﬁ  shing grounds thanks to the Fishing for Litt  er scheme and therefore encouraging further parti  cipati  on in this scheme and extending it into new areas would be beneﬁ  cial for both ﬁ  shermen and the environment. 61Economic Impacts  of Marine Litt  er
9. Scotti   sh Aquaculture
9.1 Introducti  on
Since the 1970s, the Scotti   sh aquaculture industry has rapidly developed and expanded to include species 
such as rainbow trout, halibut and a wide variety of shellﬁ  sh as well as salmon. With a farm gate value of over 
£350 million, the aquaculture industry is a key source of income and employment in Scotland, parti  cularly in rural areas where it is oft  en a key contributor to the economy (Scotti   sh Government 2009c). 
Marine litt  er can result in additi  onal costs to the aquaculture industry, parti  cularly in terms of ti  me spent 
removing debris from around ﬁ  sh farm sites and the costs associated with fouled propellers on work boats. 
A questi  onnaire was developed to investi  gate how marine litt  er aﬀ  ects the aquaculture industry and the associated economic costs. This questi  onnaire was distributed to a mixture of ﬁ  nﬁ  sh and shellﬁ  sh producers throughout Scotland. As many of the companies involved are multi  -site, most of the questi  onnaires in this project cover more than one ﬁ  sh farm locati  on.
9.2 Impact and types of litt  erA total of 8 producers experienced problems with marine litt  er accumulati  ng in cages and around mussel 
raft  s at their ﬁ  sh farm sites. Figure 9.1 below shows the most common types of debris aﬀ  ecti  ng aquaculture 
producers.
Figure 9.1: Types of litt  er which aﬀ  ect aquaculture producers
The most prevalent items of litt  er aﬀ  ecti  ng the aquaculture industry are rope, closely followed by plasti  c and 
wood. Producers were also concerned about the impact of ﬁ  shing debris with one producer stati  ng “old nets and ropes ﬂ  oati  ng in the area cause most concern as these do get caught in propellers or moorings on cages and can take ti  me to clear”.62Economic Impacts of Marine Litt  er
9.3 Time spent clearing and removing litt  er
The amount of ti  me producers spent removing marine litt  er from around their cages and mussel raft  s was 
highly variable. For some producers, marine litt  er posed no issues and therefore they did not have to spend any ti  me removing it. For others, marine litt  er proved to be a regular problem and these producers could spend up to half a day per month removing litt  er. Overall, producers most commonly spent somewhere between 1 – 2 hours per month removing litt  er from around their ﬁ  sh farm site.
The ti  me taken to untangle fouled propellers and clear blocked intake pipes was also similarly variable. For 
fouled propellers, the amount of ti  me necessary to untangle the propeller ranged from quarter of an hour to 2.5 hours and this could be considerably higher if divers were required. Blocked intake pipes could take between half an hour and 6 hours to clear depending on the severity of the incident.
9.4 Economic cost of marine litt  erThis project focused on the economic costs incurred by aquaculture producers due to ti  me spent removing 
marine litt  er, the cost of untangling fouled propellers and any costs resulti  ng from the repair or replacement of propellers on workboats. On average, marine litt  er costs each producer surveyed approximately € 580.41 per year and Figure 9.2 below shows how these costs are split between categories. Marine litt  er therefore costs the aquaculture industry in Scotland an esti  mated € 155,548.66 per year on average
14.
Over 90% of these costs relate to fouled propellers, either in terms of the use of divers to untangle the propeller or to repair any damage caused by the litt  er.  Just 9% of the costs incurred by producers related to the ti  me spent removing litt  er from cages and mussel lines. 
Figure 9.2: Breakdown of the average cost to aquaculture producers
14 Calculati  on based on 268 ﬁ  nﬁ  sh and shellﬁ  sh producers in Scotland in 2007, the most recent year for which data is available for 
both types of aquaculture producti  on (Fisheries Research Service 2008a and 2008b).63Economic Impacts  of Marine Litt  er
9.5 Waste disposal and eﬀ  orts to minimise marine litt  er
Responsible waste disposal is a key part of minimising the release of litt  er into the environment and over 90% 
of producers surveyed sent their waste to landﬁ  ll. Over 60% also recycled some of their waste. Aquaculture 
producers were also taking a number of other steps to reduce the amount of litt  er entering the marine environment with 82% acti  vely trying to reduce the amount of packaging taken to sea. Similarly, 73% of producers surveyed try to provide supplies with minimal packaging and 82% bring ashore any waste seen ﬂ  oati  ng in their cages or around mussel raft  s. 
9.6 Conclusion
While representi  ng only a small sample, the aquaculture producers surveyed experienced highly variable 
problems with marine litt  er. Overall, fouled propellers on work boats presented the most common issue and 
could lead to high costs in terms of repairing and replacing damaged propellers. In comparison, removing 
marine litt  er from around producti  on sites was less of an issue for aquaculture producers. 
While the cost of individual incidents was high, the average cost of marine litt  er to aquaculture producers was 
low at € 580.41 per year, reﬂ  ecti  ng the infrequent occurrence of fouled propellers. Marine litt  er therefore costs the aquaculture industry in Scotland an esti  mated €155,548.66 per year on average, which is relati  vely low, parti  cularly in comparison to other industries such as sea ﬁ  sheries.64Economic Impacts of Marine Litt  er
10. Harbours and Marinas
10.1 Introducti  on
With over 90% of global trade 
carried by sea (IMO 2009), ports and harbours are essenti  al gateways for the transportati  on of goods around the world. Marinas also make an important contributi  on to many coastal communiti  es by att  racti  ng tourists and generati  ng income and employment. In the UK for example, the marina industry has a turnover of approximately £113 million and directly employs more than 1,700 people (BMF 2007).
The primary economic impact of marine litt  er on harbours and marinas is the cost of removing marine litt  er 
in order to ensure that these faciliti  es remain clean, safe and att  racti  ve for users. This can involve both the manual removal of ﬂ  oati  ng debris and dredging speciﬁ  cally to remove marine litt  er items obstructi  ng the seabed. Questi  onnaires were developed to investi  gate the impact of marine litt  er and the associated cost of dealing with it for harbours and marinas. These were distributed to harbours and marinas in countries throughout the Northeast Atlanti  c region.
10.2 United Kingdom10.2.1 Litt  er removal: dredging and manual cleansingOverall, 46.1% of harbours and marinas surveyed took acti  on to remove marine litt  er. Within this, 6 harbours 
and marinas dredged speciﬁ  cally to remove marine litt  er and a further 36 organisati  ons manually removed marine litt  er. It is worth noti  ng that the number of harbours that manually remove marine litt  er may be higher than these results suggest as these ﬁ  gures are drawn solely from harbours’ comments. In additi  on, one harbour used a ‘seabed dragging program’ and biennial dive surveys to remove dumped wire and other debris from within harbour limits.
The ti  me these organisati  ons spent on litt  er clearance acti  viti  es varied considerably depending on the method 
they used to remove litt  er. Dredging due to marine litt  er was generally required only once every few years in most cases while the manual removal of marine litt  er tended to occur on a monthly basis. This could take anything from 1 hour per month to more than 36 hours per month, although the majority of organisati  ons spent between 1 and 5 hours per month manually removing marine litt  er. On average, this was part of the duti  es of 2 members of staﬀ   in each harbour and marina.
Harbours were also asked to identi  fy the most common types of litt  er removed during dredging and manual 
removal of litt  er, and the results are displayed in Figure 10.1 overleaf. Rope and plasti  c were the most common types of litt  er found with over 70% of those surveyed reporti  ng that they collect these types of litt  er. Wood and nets were also relati  vely common and these were found by 58.3% and 54.2% of harbours respecti  vely. 
65Economic Impacts  of Marine Litt  er
Figure 10.1: Most common types of litt  er removed by harbours
Harbours disposed of marine litt  er using a variety of methods including landﬁ  ll, incinerati  on and recycling. 
Landﬁ  ll was the most popular means of disposal with 91.9% of harbours using this method to dispose of marine litt  er. The uptake of recycling among harbours was also very encouraging and 48.7% of harbours sent at least some of the marine litt  er they collected to be recycled. Only 16.2% of harbours incinerated marine litt  er.
10.2.2 IncidentsTo gage the extent to which marine litt  er aﬀ  ects vessels, harbours and marinas were asked whether their 
users had experienced any incidents with marine debris over the last year. Over 71% of harbours and marinas reported that their users had experienced incidents such as fouled propellers, fouled anchors, fouled rudders and blocked intake pipes and valves. 
10.2.2.1 Fouled PropellersFouled propellers were by far the most commonly reported type of incident with 69% of harbours and 
marinas stati  ng that their users had experienced this type of incident. These organisati  ons were asked to identi  fy how oft  en their users either sustained a fouled propeller within harbour limits or entered the harbour having fouled their propeller elsewhere at sea. As Figure 10.2 overleaf illustrates, harbours and marinas most commonly reported between 1 and 5 fouled propellers among their users per year. Only a small proporti  on of organisati  ons reported that vessels using their faciliti  es sustained more than 5 fouled propellers per year, although one harbour did report that its users had experienced as many as 20 fouled propellers over the course of a year.
66Economic Impacts of Marine Litt  er
Figure 10.2: Frequency of fouled propellers among harbour and marina users per year
The most common types of marine litt  er causing fouled propellers are shown in Figure 10.3 overleaf. Rope 
was the most frequently identi  ﬁ  ed cause of fouled propellers with over 90% of organisati  ons reporti  ng that this type of litt  er caused entangled propellers among their users. Nets were also identi  ﬁ  ed as a cause by 52% of these organisati  ons with plasti  c (28%) and wire (27%) also relati  vely common. These ﬁ  ndings suggest that derelict ﬁ  shing debris, such as ropes and nets, can pose disproporti  onately high health and safety risks in the marine environment.
10.2.2.2 Other types of incidentUsers experienced problems with fouled anchors caused by marine litt  er in 7.7% of harbours and marinas 
surveyed. A further 13.2% of these organisati  ons reported that their users had experienced fouled rudders due to marine litt  er. Approximately 28.6% of harbours and marinas also reported that their users had experienced blocked intake pipes and valves due to marine litt  er. Harbours described a range of other incidents including:
Collisions with ﬂ  oati  ng logs and sleepers• 
Fouling of navigati  on buoy moorings and damage to buoys• 
Plasti  c bags and crisp bags blocking instruments• 
Vessel damage during lift  ing operati  ons to repair damage caused by marine litt  er• 67Economic Impacts  of Marine Litt  er

10.2.3 Measures and campaigns to prevent marine litt  er10.2.3.1 HarboursThe harbours surveyed during this project had introduced a number of measures and campaigns to prevent 
litt  er from reaching the marine environment. All of the harbours surveyed meet the EU Directi  ve on Port Waste Recepti  on Faciliti  es (EC2000/59) and 96.8% of harbours encourage vessels to dispose of waste, parti  cularly old ropes and nets, using harbour faciliti  es. In total, 88.9% of harbours had also set up recycling faciliti  es for vessels’ waste. The most common types of recycling faciliti  es are displayed in Figure 10.4 overleaf and faciliti  es for oil, galley waste and old batt  eries were most frequently provided.
Similarly, 58.7% of harbours highlight the problem of marine litt  er in their area and ways to prevent it. This is 
typically done through posters, lett  ers and pamphlets but harbours also used harbour liaison meeti  ngs, arti  cles in newslett  ers and publicati  ons, and local publicity to raise awareness of marine litt  er issues. In additi  on, 47.6% of harbours had launched campaigns to highlight the harm marine litt  er can do to the environment and the shipping industry. 68Economic Impacts of Marine Litt  er

10.2.3.2 MarinasThe marinas involved in this project were keenly aware of the issues marine litt  er can pose, both to the 
environment and to vessels, and 92.3% therefore encouraged bett  er waste management practi  ces among their users. In additi  on, 76.9% publicised these faciliti  es and tried to promote recycling among their users.
Approximately 30% of the marinas surveyed held some form of award and the most popular was the Golden 
Anchor award scheme operated by the Yacht Harbour Associati  on. This award scheme includes provisions for a port waste management plan and the marinas involved in this scheme generally held either 4 or 5 Golden Anchors depending on the level of faciliti  es available. A smaller number of marinas met the requirements for Blue Flag awards, Green Tourism awards and ISO 14001 status.
10.2.4 Economic cost of marine litt  er10.2.4.1 HarboursThe total cost of marine litt  er removal reported by 34 harbours in the UK was €273,168.58 with an average 
cost of €8,034.37 per harbour per year. Based on this average, marine litt  er costs the ports and harbours industry in the UK approximately €2.4 million each year
15. Costs to individual harbours ranged between €0 
and €72,935.07 per year with just 6 harbours experiencing above average costs. The wide diﬀ  erence in costs between harbours is in part due to the diﬀ  ering size and use of harbours with costs generally higher in large faciliti  es and busy ﬁ  shing ports.
A breakdown of the average cost of removing litt  er to harbours is given in Figure 10.5 overleaf. Disposal of 
15 Calculated based on 300 acti  ve ports and harbours in the UK  (UKHMA, 2010, Personal Communicati  on)69Economic Impacts  of Marine Litt  er
marine litt  er represents the biggest cost to harbours and accounts for approximately 36.8% of the average 
cost of litt  er removal, although these costs are dominated by landﬁ  ll. The manual removal of litt  er also consti  tutes a key cost to harbours, making up 31.7% of the average cost of litt  er removal. While dredging 
represents a relati  vely low proporti  on of the average cost to harbours, this is relati  vely high considering the 
small number of harbours which use this method to remove marine litt  er.  
Figure 10.5: Breakdown of the average cost of marine litt  er to harbours in the UK
10.2.4.2 MarinasOnly 6 marinas were able to report the costs associated with litt  er clearance operati  ons and these marinas 
spent a total of €56,954.47 per year on marine litt  er removal. The cost of removing marine litt  er ranged from between €127.76 and €38,537.55 and there was a clear split between the level of costs experienced by community marinas and those experienced by larger, commercially operated marinas. Smaller, community marinas tended to have much lower costs while large, tourist oriented marinas generally experienced signiﬁ  cantly higher costs driven by the need to remain att  racti  ve in a highly competi  ti  ve market. 
10.3 Case Study: Spain10.3.1 Litt  er removal: dredging and manual cleansingVirtually all of the Spanish harbours and marinas surveyed manually removed marine litt  er ﬂ  oati  ng in their 
harbour but none had to dredge speciﬁ  cally to deal with marine litt  er accumulati  ng on the seabed. Only one marina took no acti  on to remove marine litt  er. The main types of litt  er removed by harbours are displayed in Figure 10.6 overleaf. Plasti  cs were the most common type of litt  er removed by harbours with all of those surveyed reporti  ng that they collected this type of litt  er. Wood, rope and bott  les were also commonly found during harbour clearance acti  viti  es.70Economic Impacts of Marine Litt  er
Figure 10.6: Most common types of litt  er collected by Spanish harbours
The manual removal of litt  er was a relati  vely ti  me intensive acti  vity for most of the Spanish harbours and 
marinas surveyed during this project, as shown in Figure 10.7 below. In total, 7 harbours and marinas spent more than 36 hours per month removing litt  er that collected within their harbour limits. 
Figure 10.7: Amount of ti  me spent by Spanish harbours and marinas removing marine litt  er 71Economic Impacts  of Marine Litt  er
In terms of disposal, 8 harbours sent marine litt  er to landﬁ  ll while 7 used recycling faciliti  es. Therefore 2 
harbours exclusively relied on recycling to dispose of marine litt  er and this is very encouraging as marine litt  er is generally thought to be diﬃ   cult to recycle due to contaminati  on and diﬃ   culti  es separati  ng waste streams.  
10.3.2 IncidentsSpanish harbours and marinas were also asked whether their users had experienced any incidents with marine 
litt  er over the last year to gage how marine litt  er aﬀ  ects vessels in that area. Over half of the organisati  ons surveyed reported that their users had experienced some kind of incident involving marine litt  er. The most common type of incident was a fouled propeller with 10 harbours and marinas reporti  ng that their users had experienced this type of incident. Fouled propellers generally only occurred occasionally but 1 marina did report that its users had sustained as many as 15 fouled propellers over the course of a year. The causes of fouled propellers were broadly similar to those reported in the UK with rope, nets and plasti  cs identi  ﬁ  ed as the main causes of these incidents.
Other types of incidents involving marine litt  er were relati  vely rare according to Spanish harbours and marinas. 
Only 3 organisati  ons reported that vessels using their faciliti  es had experienced blocked intake pipes caused by marine litt  er. A further 2 organisati  ons reported that their users had sustained fouled rudders and only 1 marina reported a fouled anchor among its users.
10.3.3 Measures and campaigns to prevent marine litt  erThe Spanish harbours surveyed during this project have introduced a number of measures to tackle marine 
litt  er and all those surveyed met the requirements of the EU Directi  ve on Port Waste Recepti  on Faciliti  es (EC2000/59). 9 out of 10 harbours also encouraged users to dispose of their waste using harbour faciliti  es, parti  cularly ropes, nets and ﬁ  sh boxes. In additi  on, 8 harbours had set up recycling areas and these mostly focused on oil, nets, ropes and galley waste. 
Just over half of the harbours surveyed highlighted the issue of marine litt  er in their area and ways to prevent 
it. This was typically done using posters, lett  ers and pamphlets but several harbours also oﬀ  ered free lectures and courses about marine litt  er. Half of the harbours surveyed had launched campaigns to raise awareness of the harm marine litt  er can cause to the environment and the shipping industry.
Similarly, all the marinas surveyed as part of this project encouraged their users to practi  ce bett  er waste 
management techniques. In additi  on, 10 marinas publicised their faciliti  es and promoted recycling among their users. More than half the marinas surveyed also held some form of award that required them to meet environmental and waste management commitments. The most common types of awards were Blue Flags and ISO 14001 certi  ﬁ  cati  on.
10.3.4 Economic cost of marine litt  er10.3.4.1 HarboursThe total cost of marine litt  er reported by 9 Spanish ports and harbours amounted to €549,117.33 with an 
average cost of €61,013.04 per harbour per year. A breakdown of costs is presented in Figure 10.8 overleaf and the vast majority of costs clearly relate to the manual removal of litt  er. While this is a small case study, 72Economic Impacts of Marine Litt  er
these costs are relati  vely high with the average cost to Spanish harbours approximately 7 ti  mes higher than 
that reported by harbours in the UK. 
Figure 10.8: Breakdown of the average cost of marine litt  er to Spanish harbours
10.3.4.2 MarinasThe total cost of marine litt  er removal reported by 5 marinas in Spain was €14,800. All of these costs related 
to the manual removal of litt  er and included the collecti  on, transportati  on and disposal of marine litt  er. Overall, the costs reported by each marina ranged between €100 and €8,500 per year with higher costs generally experienced by larger marinas. 
10.4 Additi  onal Informati  onA small number of responses were received from harbours and marinas in Denmark, Norway and Portugal 
and a brief summary of these questi  onnaires is provided in Table 10.1 overleaf.
10.5 ConclusionHarbours and marinas remove marine litt  er to ensure that their faciliti  es remain clean, safe and att  racti  ve for 
users. Depending on its severity, removing marine litt  er can be relati  vely ti  me intensive and put a considerable strain on these organisati  ons’ resources. The UK ports and harbours industry therefore spends approximately €2.4 million each year
16 removing marine litt  er with an average cost of €8,034.37 per harbour. However, these 
costs can be considerably higher in individual harbours, parti  cularly for large faciliti  es and busy ﬁ  shing ports. Removing marine litt  er could also be costly for marinas with costs as high as €38,537.55 per year reported 
16 Calculated based on 300 acti  ve ports and harbours in the UK  (UKHMA, 2010, Personal Communicati  on)73Economic Impacts  of Marine Litt  er
in the UK but the small size of the sample prevented 
the calculati  on of the cost of marine litt  er to the marina industry.
The informati  on provided by harbours and marinas also 
suggests that incidents involving vessel damage caused by marine litt  er are widespread with over 70% of UK harbours and marinas reporti  ng that their users had experienced incidents involving marine litt  er. Fouled propellers were the most common type of incidents reported but overall, incidents involving marine litt  er generally only occurred occasionally. The most common cause of fouled propellers was derelict ﬁ  shing gear such as ropes and nets, which suggests that this type of marine litt  er can pose disproporti  onately high health and safety risks. 
The harbours and marinas surveyed during this project 
were making a considerable eﬀ  ort to prevent marine litt  er and promote responsible waste practi  ces among vessels using their faciliti  es. All the harbours surveyed met the EU Directi  ve on Port Waste Recepti  on Faciliti  es (EC2000/59) and many organisati  ons had put in place additi  onal measures to encourage the responsible disposal of ships’ waste including recycling faciliti  es, informati  on boards and publicity campaigns about the detrimental impact of marine litt  er on shipping and the environment. Marinas were similarly keen to promote responsible waste practi  ces amongst their users and many held some form of award that included commitments towards responsible waste disposal.
In additi  on to current eﬀ  orts by harbours and marinas to reduce marine litt  er, there are a number of other 
programs and measures that could also help to reduce the amount of litt  er entering the marine environment. Improvements to the enforcement of the EU Directi  ve on Port Waste Recepti  on Faciliti  es (EC2000/50), the introducti  on of compulsory waste disposal for all vessels and the implementati  on of a “no special fee” system for the use of waste recepti  on faciliti  es would increase the incenti  ve for vessels to responsibly dispose of waste in harbours. 
Similarly, the introducti  on of a zero waste policy for all vessels, which bans the disposal of any waste at 
sea, including incinerator ash, and higher minimum penalti  es for illegal dumping could deter vessels from illegally discharging waste. Acti  on is also required to improve the monitoring and enforcement of current legislati  on, as there have been very few prosecuti  ons to date under MARPOL Annex V legislati  on. Finally, environmental awareness training, including marine litt  er issues, should be made compulsory for all ship owners and operators, crew members, ﬁ  shermen and recreati  onal boat owners.

11. Rescue Services
11.1 Introducti  on
Marine litt  er can pose signiﬁ  cant navigati  onal hazards to vessels and incidents such as fouled propellers, fouled 
anchors and equipment, and blocked intake pipes and valves can endanger the safety of both the vessel and its crew. Many of these incidents will require assistance, either from other vessels or the emergency services, in order to ensure the vessel’s immediate safety and to assist it to return to port where any necessary repairs can be made. 
While the safety of crew members is clearly the foremost concern in these situati  ons, rescue operati  ons 
involving the coastguard will also have an economic cost. A questi  onnaire was developed to investi  gate 
how fouled propellers aﬀ  ect the coastguard and the associated costs of providing rescue services in these 
situati  ons. This questi  onnaire was distributed to coastguard services in countries throughout the Northeast 
Atlanti  c region. 
11.2 United KingdomThe Royal Nati  onal Lifeboat 
Insti  tuti  on (RNLI) provides a 24-hour lifeboat search and rescue service around the coast of the UK and the republic of Ireland. The RNLI has an acti  ve ﬂ  eet of more than 300 lifeboats, including all weather and inshore lifeboats, and a relief ﬂ  eet of approximately 100 vessels. The RNLI costs approximately £147.7 million (€166.59 million) to run every year and this includes the cost of vessels, lifeguards, crew kits, lifeboat reﬁ  t costs and the cost of launching lifeboats in the event of emergency (RNLI 2010). 
11.2.1 Rescues to vessels with fouled propellersDuring 2008, the last year for which data is available, the RNLI made 286 rescues to vessels with fouled 
propellers and Figure 11.2 overleaf shows the types of vessels that required assistance. Approximately 67.5% of rescues to vessels with fouled propellers were made to pleasure craft   and 31.1% involved ﬁ  shing vessels. Just 7 rescues were undertaken to commercial vessels with fouled propellers and the lifeboat also att  ended one incident involving a rescue vessel with a fouled propeller. 
Figure 11.1: Marine litt  er poses signiﬁ  cant navigati  onal hazards for  vessels and incidents 
involving marine litt  er may require assistance from the emergency services. Image:          © www.austi  ntaylorphotography.com76Economic Impacts of Marine Litt  er
Figure 11.2: Types of vessel rescued due to a fouled propeller in 2008
These incidents occurred throughout the UK’s waters and Figure 11.3 overleaf shows the locati  on of rescues 
to vessels with fouled propellers in 2008. The geographical patt  ern of vessels with fouled propellers is broadly similar to that recorded by Hall (2000) with the south coast of England remaining a hotspot for these incidents. Comparison with Hall’s (2000) ﬁ  ndings also reveals a clear shift   in the types of vessels requiring rescue over the past 10 years. In 1998, ﬁ  shing vessels were more likely than pleasure craft   to require emergency assistance due to fouled propellers but in 2008, the opposite was true with this type of rescue more likely to involve pleasure craft  .77Economic Impacts  of Marine Litt  er

Figure 11.3: Map showing the locati  on of vessels with fouled propellers att  ended to by the RNLI during 2008. 
Image: RNLI.78Economic Impacts of Marine Litt  er
Over the period 2002-2008, the RNLI att  ended an average of 267 rescues per year to vessels with fouled 
propellers. On average, 104 of these rescues were to ﬁ  shing vessels, 157 to pleasure craft  , 4 to commercial ships and 2 to ‘other’ vessels. Over this 7-year period, there is also evidence of a rising trend in the total number of rescues to fouled propellers each year, as shown in Figure 11.4 below. Most of this increase can be accounted for by the rising number of pleasure craft   requiring lifeboat assistance with the number of ﬁ  shing vessels sustaining fouled propellers generally remaining broadly stati  c over the 7-year period.  
Figure 11.4: Changes in number and type of rescues carried out by the RNLI 2002 - 2008
The RNLI does not record the causes of fouled propellers and therefore it is possible that a small number of 
these incidents may not be the result of marine litt  er. Furthermore, it is also important to note that not all fouled propellers require the help of the emergency services as other vessels may be available to provide assistance and tow vessels with fouled propellers back to port. 
11.2.2 Levels of dangerA fouled propeller can aﬀ  ect the stability of a vessel in the water and its ability to manoeuvre, potenti  ally 
placing the vessel and its crew in serious danger. During 2008, vessels were judged by the RNLI to be in life threatening danger in just 0.7% of rescues to vessels with fouled propellers. Another 7.7% of fouled propeller rescues were to vessels in danger while 91.6% of vessels with fouled propellers were judged to be in no danger by the RNLI. 
11.2.3 Economic cost of rescues to vessels with fouled propellersThe cost of undertaking 286 rescues to vessels with fouled propellers during 2008 was between €830,000 79Economic Impacts  of Marine Litt  er
and €2,189,00017, depending on whether an inshore or all weather lifeboat was used. This includes the 
running costs of a lifeboat stati  on such as training crews, lifeboat maintenance and stati  on maintenance, but 
does not take into account the substanti  al cost of depreciati  on of the lifeboat. 
The total cost of rescues to vessels with fouled propellers between 2002 and 2008 is €6.4 – €17 million 
and Figure 11.5 below illustrates how the annual cost of rescues to vessels with fouled propellers changed between 2002 and 2008. The highest costs were recorded in 2006 when 298 fouled propeller rescues were carried out at a cost of between €1,132,003.66 and €2,984,371.66. 
Figure 11.5: Changes in the total cost of rescues carried out by the RNLI to vessels with a fouled propeller 
2002 - 2008.
It is important to note that the RNLI’s oﬃ   cial esti  mates of the cost of launching a lifeboat has not changed 
since 1998 and therefore the ﬁ  ndings presented here are likely to underesti  mate the full cost of rescues to vessels with fouled propellers. Similarly, lifeboat crews are oft  en volunteers who give up their own ti  me to take part in rescue operati  ons and the ﬁ  ndings presented here do not include the cost of volunteers’ ti  me and lost working hours.
11.3 NorwayThe Norwegian Society for Sea Rescues (NSSR) provided data about the number of rescues it undertakes 
each year to vessels with fouled propellers. Between 2002 and 2007, the NSSR carried out an average of 110 rescues to vessels with fouled propellers each year. Approximately 78.3% of these rescues were to pleasure craft  , 17.3% to ﬁ  shing vessels and 4.4% to commercial ships on average. Figure 11.6 overleaf shows how the number and types of vessels with fouled propellers has changed between 2002 and 2007. 
17 The RNLI oﬃ   cially puts the cost of launching an inshore lifeboat at £2,200 and an all weather lifeboat at £5,800. These ﬁ  gures 
have been adjusted for inﬂ  ati  on and converted to Euros.80Economic Impacts of Marine Litt  er
Over this 6-year period, there is also an increasing trend in the number of rescues to vessels with fouled 
propellers and the highest number of rescues was recorded in 2007. During 2007, the NSSR undertook 138 rescues to vessels with fouled propellers. Over 86% of these rescues were to pleasure craft   with just 8% made to assist ﬁ  shing vessels with fouled propellers. In additi  on, approximately 5.8% of rescues to vessels with fouled propellers were made to commercial ships. Unfortunately, the NSSR was unable to provide data as regards the level of danger these vessels were in or the associated cost of rescues over this period.
Figure 11.6: Changes in types and numbers of rescues carried out by NSSR between 2002-2007
11.4 ConclusionFrom the results presented in this chapter, it is evident that marine litt  er conti  nues to pose a signiﬁ  cant 
navigati  onal hazard to vessels in the Northeast Atlanti  c. The rising number of rescues to vessels with fouled propellers is of parti  cular concern because it means that more lives are unnecessarily being put at risk each year due to marine litt  er. Most of the increase in rescues is accounted for by a rise in the number of fouled propellers sustained by pleasure craft   with the number incurred by ﬁ  shing vessels remaining broadly stati  c.
While the safety of crew members is clearly the foremost concern in these situati  ons, rescue operati  ons 
involving the coastguard can result in high costs for the emergency services. In 2008, rescues to vessels with fouled propellers cost between €830,000 and €2,189,000
18 and this is likely to be considerably higher in 
reality given that the RNLI has not updated the cost of launching a lifeboat since 1998. Similarly, these ﬁ  gures do not take into account any costs incurred through rescues to other incidents such as fouled anchors, fouled rudders, blocked intake pipes and incidents involving swimmers and divers. A rising trend is also evident in the number of rescues to vessels with fouled propellers in Norwegian waters, which suggests that marine litt  er poses widespread and growing problems for navigati  on.

12. Shetland Agricultural Industry
12.1 Introducti  on
Marine litt  er can cause a wide range of problems for agricultural producers in 
coastal communiti  es including damage 
to property and equipment, harm to livestock and the cost of litt  er removal. A questi  onnaire was developed to investi  gate these impacts further and assess the economic cost of marine litt  er to coastal agricultural producers. This questi  onnaire was only distributed to croft  ers
19 within the Shetland Islands, UK.
12.2 Types and levels of litt  er
Marine litt  er blows onto the land of 90% of the croft  ers surveyed during this project and Figure 12.2 below 
shows the main types of litt  er that accumulate on their land. Plasti  c is by far the most common type of litt  er 
and over 95% of croft  ers found this type of litt  er on their land. Rope, strapping bands and nets are also relati  vely common and each of these types of litt  er was found by more than 65% of the croft  ers surveyed during this project. In total, 64.3% of croft  ers found more than 5 diﬀ  erent types of marine litt  er on their land. 
Figure 12.2: Types of litt  er which aﬀ  ects croft  ers’ land

croft  erscommission.org.ukFigure 12.1 Marine litt  er can accumulate on fences and result in signiﬁ  cant 
costs for croft  ers to remove the litt  er and repair the fences.
82Economic Impacts of Marine Litt  er
Croft  ers experienced parti  cular problems with speciﬁ  c types of litt  er and several croft  ers had diﬃ   culti  es 
with mussel ﬂ  oats from nearby aquaculture sites. These measure almost a meter in width and could cause substanti  al damage to walls and fences, although this was a fairly localised issue. Oil drums also conti  nued to cause problems and one croft  er reported watching 2 oil drums come ashore immediately aft  er he had seen a ﬁ  shing vessel pass by. This was parti  cularly frustrati  ng as “there’s absolutely no need for boats to be dumping with the faciliti  es on oﬀ  er.”
However, croft  ers were generally agreed that the overall level of litt  er coming ashore had substanti  ally 
decreased over the past 5-10 years. One croft  er stated “Certainly, fences used to be absolutely clad in litt  er in wind but there is signiﬁ  cantly less litt  er now.” This was generally thought to be due to the decommissioning of ﬁ  shing vessels, bett  er working practi  ces in the aquaculture industry and the rapid decline in factory ﬁ  shing vessels visiti  ng the isles from Eastern Europe. 
12.3 Harm to livestockMarine litt  er can harm livestock, as well as wildlife, and approximately 41.9% of croft  ers reported that their 
livestock had either ingested marine litt  er or become entangled in it over the past year. A total of 24 animals had become entangled in marine litt  er over the past year at 10 diﬀ  erent croft  s. One croft  er had experienced several cases where a sheep became trapped in nets that were snagged on rocks and then drowned when the ti  de came in. In additi  on, 5 croft  ers reported that animals had ingested marine litt  er on their croft  s and this aﬀ  ected a total of 8 animals. The rates of entanglement and ingesti  on reported in this project are comparable with those reported by Hall (2000) and have not signiﬁ  cantly changed over the past 10 years.
12.4 Removal of marine litt  er and damage to propertyMarine litt  er had caused damage to fences on 71.4% of the croft  s surveyed and croft  ers spent between 1 
and 30 hours per month removing litt  er from their fences. In total, 11 croft  ers had spent 840 hours over the past year removing marine litt  er from their fences with an average of 76.4 hours per year spent removing litt  er from fences at each croft  . Similarly, 60.7% of croft  ers reported damage to their drainage ditches caused by marine litt  er. Removing marine litt  er from drainage ditches took 10 croft  ers a total of 342 hours per year and ti  me spent removing litt  er from drainage ditches ranged from 30 minutes per month to over 8 hours a month. Damage to machinery caused by marine litt  er was relati  vely rare among the croft  ers surveyed and just 3 croft  ers had experienced this problem.

12.5 Economic cost of marine litt  er
Marine litt  er can result in increased costs for croft  ers in terms of additi  onal vets bills, repairs to machinery and 
fences, and removing marine litt  er from their land, fences and drainage ditches. Marine litt  er cost each croft   
an average of €841.10 per year with overall costs ranging from €0 to €4,742.08 depending on how severely the croft   was aﬀ  ected. A breakdown of the average cost of marine litt  er to croft  ers is provided in Figure 12.4 below. Removing marine litt  er accounts for the vast majority of costs to croft  ers and clearing land, ditches and fences accounted for approximately 87% of the average cost of marine litt  er to croft  ers. Additi  onal vets 
bills and repairs to machinery were relati  vely costly for those aﬀ  ected but made up only a small proporti  on 
of the average cost of marine litt  er since these incidents were relati  vely rare.
Calculati  ng the cost of marine litt  er to the agriculture industry in Shetland as a whole is relati  vely complicated, 
parti  cularly as it is virtually impossible to determine how many of Shetland’s 1,200 acti  ve croft  ers have land 
adjacent to the coast. Marine litt  er will also not aﬀ  ect all coastal croft  s in Shetland due to geography and ti  dal 
patt  erns. This research therefore esti  mates that marine litt  er will cost the agriculture industry in Shetland approximately €252,331, based on the assumpti  on that 25% of croft  ers in Shetland are aﬀ  ected by marine litt  er
20. The extent to which these issues aﬀ  ect the agricultural industry elsewhere is unknown but one 
farmer from the south of England remarked elsewhere in the project that “[his farm] meadows oft  en ﬂ  ood and debris creates problems - damage to machinery, contaminated hay, occasional damage to livestock.” Similarly a Swedish farmer commented that marine litt  er “is a big problem and it costs a lot of money to keep our land in a proper order”.

12.6 Conclusion
Marine litt  er conti  nues to present a wide range of issues for croft  ers in coastal regions including damage 
to property and machinery, harm to livestock and the cost of litt  er removal. While harm to livestock and damage to machinery were relati  vely infrequent, most croft  ers had to regularly remove marine litt  er from their fences, ditches and land. This could be parti  cularly ti  me intensive with the removal of marine litt  er from fences alone taking an average of 76.4 hours or the equivalent of almost 10 working days per year.
The croft  ers surveyed during this project were broadly agreed however that the amount of marine litt  er 
coming ashore had decreased during the past 5-10 years, although plasti  cs and derelict ﬁ  shing gear conti  nue to pose problems. Generally, this decrease was thought to be the result of localised factors including decommissioning of ﬁ  shing vessels, bett  er working practi  ces in the aquaculture industry and the rapid decline 
in factory ﬁ  shing vessels visiti  ng the isles from Eastern Europe
Despite a decrease in the quanti  ty of litt  er, the average cost of marine litt  er to croft  ers was considerable. 
Marine litt  er costs the agriculture industry in Shetland approximately €252,331 per year with an average cost of €841.10 per croft  er. The vast majority of costs are incurred removing marine litt  er from ditches, fences and the land, although harm to livestock and damage to machinery can result in high economic costs when these incidents occur. The cost of marine litt  er to croft  ers is parti  cularly concerning given that many croft  ers are small producers and therefore have relati  vely ti  ght proﬁ  t margins. While the economic impact of marine litt  er on croft  ers in Shetland is clearly signiﬁ  cant, more research is required to determine how marine litt  er aﬀ  ects farmers in other coastal regions.85Economic Impacts  of Marine Litt  er
13. UK Power Stati  ons, Industrial Seawater Abstractors and Water Authoriti  es
13.1 Introducti  on
Seawater is an essenti  al resource for several industries, parti  cularly power generati  on faciliti  es, and these 
industries use a variety of means to screen out both natural and man-made debris. Marine litt  er, however, 
can result in the blockage of cooling water intake screens, increased removal of debris from screens and additi  onal maintenance costs to these industries.
While these companies prevent marine litt  er entering their faciliti  es, water authoriti  es use screens to 
prevent litt  er, parti  cularly sewage related debris (SRD), reaching the marine environment in the ﬁ  rst place. 
Questi  onnaires were developed to investi  gate the impact of marine litt  er on industrial seawater abstractors, including power stati  ons, and the eﬀ  orts of water authoriti  es to prevent SRD reaching the marine environment. These questi  onnaires were distributed to organisati  ons within the United Kingdom.
13.2 Power Stati  onsAlthough many power stati  ons within the UK rely on seawater as part of their cooling process, only 3 responses 
were received from this sector and therefore these responses are featured individually below.
13.2.1 Lerwick Power Stati  on, Shetland
Lerwick Power Stati  on in Shetland has 3 seawater 
intake pipes from the harbour, which are situated 
approximately 3 meters down. The ‘A’ Stati  on 
receives seawater from 1 of these pipes while the 
other 2 supply the ‘B’ stati  on. Each stati  on has 2 
ﬂ  ushing debris screens that run for approximately 1 hour per day.
The outer intake screens on these pipes are 
inspected every 2 years and the ﬂ  ushing screens are cleared once a month. Approximately ½ tonne of debris is removed each year but most of this is organic debris. Lerwick Power Stati  on is not aﬀ  ected by much man-made waste due to the positi  on of the intake pipes and marine litt  er therefore results in very litt  le cost to the stati  on.
13.2.2 Peterhead Power Stati  on, Aberdeenshire
The cooling water system at Peterhead Power Stati  on supplies seawater and the cooling water inlet is located 
a short distance away at Boddam harbour. Coarse screening of the cooling water is carried out in the harbour by twelve bar screens and ﬁ  ne screening is done using four rotati  ng drum screens. Each drum screen serves one main cooling water pump and is only required in service when the pump is running. During normal operati  on at Peterhead Power Stati  on, only 1 of the main units is in operati  on at any one ti  me and this requires two water cooling pumps and the associated drum screens to be in operati  on conti  nuously.
86Economic Impacts of Marine Litt  er
The coarse screens at Boddam harbour are cleaned approximately 3 ti  mes a year. Debris collected from 
the cooling water using the rotati  ng drum screens is washed into 2 trash pits via rubbish gullies and regular visual inspecti  ons are carried out to assess the need to empty the trash pits. During the ﬁ  rst 9 months of 2009, a total of 24.78 tonnes of debris was collected using the intake screens at Peterhead Power Stati  on. Approximately 5% of this waste is marine litt  er and the rest is organic debris, although it is very diﬃ   cult to determine the quanti  ty of waste that comes from human acti  viti  es. 
The cost of cleaning the screens and disposing of the waste removed is € 16,516.09 per year. Marine litt  er 
therefore costs the power stati  on approximately € 825.80
21 per year but a reducti  on in marine litt  er is unlikely 
to result in any signiﬁ  cant cost savings since the stati  on would sti  ll have to remove organic debris.
13.2.3 Magnox North, Wylfa Site, Anglesey
At Wylfa, there are 4 48’ diameter drum screens and each of these serves a cooling water pump. These 
screens are in service 24 hours a day and are used to screen out seaweed, ﬁ  sh, shells and ﬂ  oati  ng debris. The 
clearance of the drum screens is very dependent on the prevailing weather conditi  ons with a combinati  on of 
north or northwesterly winds, low water and an incoming ti  de resulti  ng in the highest quanti  ti  es of debris.
Under normal operati  ng conditi  ons, the daily volume of debris is generally small and amounts to approximately 
1 cubic metre per drum screen. In extreme situati  ons, there could be stati  on personnel clearing debris from the drum screens conti  nuously for up to 24 hours. Marine litt  er, such as plasti  c bott  les and carrier bags, 
accounts for up to 1% of the debris removed using screens and organic debris, parti  cularly seaweed, presents 
the most problems for Wylfa.
13.3 Industrial seawater abstractors
While many industrial seawater abstractors experience similar issues with marine litt  er to power stati  ons, 
the response rate was similarly low and 7 organisati  ons completed the questi  onnaire in total.
13.3.1 Problems with marine litt  er
The companies surveyed during this project used seawater for a variety of functi  ons including:
Flushing sewerage faciliti  es• 
Suppression of dust at a coal terminal• 
Cooling purposes• 
To feed a salt-water ﬁ  re main• 
Each company was asked to rate the extent to which marine litt  er posed problems for their company. In total, 
4 respondents stated that marine litt  er posed no problems for their company and the remaining 3 identi  ﬁ  ed 
marine litt  er as an “occasional problem”.
13.3.2 Debris screening and removal
Most of the companies surveyed during this project used screens to remove marine debris and these screens 
21 Calculated using the total cost of clearing debris from intake screens and the percentage of debris collected that is man-made.87Economic Impacts  of Marine Litt  er
needed cleansing on variable frequencies depending on the build up of litt  er. The level of debris experienced 
by some companies meant they had to clean intake screens every week while others only needed to clean screens once a year. The amount of debris removed using these screens was generally small and ranged from 
3 cubic metres to several large trailer loads a year. 
Determining what percentage of the debris removed using these screens was marine litt  er was diﬃ   cult but 
companies esti  mated that between 40 – 90% of the debris removed was man-made. Only 1 company was 
able to provide data about how much marine litt  er cost to remove and this amounted to approximately 
€ 132.13
22. These costs would be unlikely to decrease in the event that less marine litt  er accumulated on 
screens since cleansing operati  ons would sti  ll be necessary to deal with organic debris.
13.4 Water authoriti  esQuesti  onnaires were distributed to all water authoriti  es in the UK with responsibility for water and sewerage 
services in coastal areas in order to investi  gate their eﬀ  orts to prevent marine litt  er. 
13.4.1 Scotti   sh WaterScotti   sh Water provides water and waste water services to over 2.4million households across an area of 
79,000 square kilometres. During 2008/2009, Scotti   sh water removed a total of 11,345 tonnes of grit and solid items using its screens. Unfortunately, it is not possible to determine what proporti  on of these screenings was SRD. 
In additi  on, approximately 6.7% of domesti  c dwellings in Scotland are not connected to the public sewerage 
system. Scotti   sh Water has parti  cipated in the nati  onal ‘Bag It and Bin It’ campaign, which aims to protect the UK’s beaches, rivers and canals from SRD. 
13.4.2 South West Water LtdSouth West Water Ltd. (SWW) is the water and sewerage services provider for Devon, Cornwall and small 
parts of Dorset and Somerset. Although the smallest of the water and sewerage companies in England and Wales, it has 33% of the countries’ designated bathing beaches within its area. During 2009, 4,023 tonnes of debris were removed using screens but this includes all material removed from sewerage treatment works and combined sewer overﬂ  ows (CSO’s) and therefore not all of this will be SRD. 
Since privati  sati  on of the water industry in 1989, SWW has invested €2.26 billion in its Clean Sweep programme 
to improve bathing waters around its coast. This has included the removal of 250 crude sewage outf  alls that previously existed and were inherited by the company during privati  sati  on. Over the last 10 years, SWW has also invested €84.6 million in improving the quality of discharges from CSO’s throughout the region. South West Water also point out that “much of what is described as sewage related debris may not have come from sewers at all but actually have been discarded on the beach (e.g. condoms, sanitary items) or oﬀ  shore via shipping and pleasure craft   for example.”
South West Water acti  vely promotes the responsible use of sewers and is part of the Sewer Network Abuse 
Preventi  on (SNAP) group, which is concerned with inappropriate discharges into sewers. The company has 
22 Calculated using the total cost of clearing debris from intake screens and the percentage of debris collected that is man-made.88Economic Impacts of Marine Litt  er
also produced a number of leaﬂ  ets and posters over the past few years to highlight various issues such as 
‘The Dirty Dozen’, targeti  ng the 12 most common causes of sewer blockages. South West Water has also parti  cipated in the ‘Bin It Don’t Flush it’ campaign and operates a customer caravan at numerous shows and events throughout the year to draw att  enti  on to the problems caused by inappropriate discharges. 
13.5 ConclusionMarine litt  er can result in multi  ple issues for seawater abstractors including the blockage of cooling water 
intake screens, increased removal of debris from screens and additi  onal maintenance costs to these industries. From the examples provided in this chapter, it appears that the impact of marine litt  er on seawater abstractors, including power stati  ons, can be quite variable but generally tends to occur at a relati  vely low level. Unfortunately, it is very diﬃ   cult to determine the economic cost of marine litt  er to these companies, as most do not record this kind of informati  on.
Water authoriti  es play a key role in preventi  ng SRD reaching the marine environment and the examples in 
this project demonstrate the diverse measures and initi  ati  ves water authoriti  es use to promote responsible use of sewage faciliti  es and reduce the amount of SRD entering the sewage system.89Economic Impacts  of Marine Litt  er
14. Case Study: Shetland Islands, UK
14.1 Introducti  on
Marine litt  er clearly aﬀ  ects a wide range of 
industries and the aim of this chapter is to 
draw together the various secti  ons of this project into a case study of the economic 
impact of marine litt  er on one coastal 
community, the Shetland Islands in the 
United Kingdom. Located midway between 
the UK mainland and Norway, Shetland is a 
group of over a 100 islands with a populati  on 
of approximately 22,000 people spread across 
15 inhabited islands. With more than 2,700km of 
coastline, Shetland has a strong connecti  on to the sea 
and many industries rely on the marine environment for their livelihoods. Shetland therefore provides a 
strong foundati  on for a case study of the economic impact of marine litt  er on a single coastal community.
Analysing the cost of marine litt  er in a Shetland context was carried out in two ways. Where a single body was 
responsible for a sector, such as the municipality, these results were taken as the total cost for that sector. For broad based sectors, such as ﬁ  sheries and agriculture, the average cost of marine litt  er to one organisati  on 
was used to ﬁ  nd the overall cost for that sector.
14.2 Economic cost of marine litt  er
Marine litt  er costs the Shetland economy between €1 million and €1.1 million each year. As Figure 14.1 
overleaf shows, the ﬁ  shing industry shoulders the highest burden of costs and losses due to marine litt  er with 
the industry losing between € 637,110 and € 709,105
23 as a result of marine litt  er each year. Lost earnings as 
a result of ti  me spent removing marine litt  er from nets make up a relati  vely high proporti  on of these costs 
and this is of parti  cular concern in view of the conti  nuing European restricti  ons on the number of days vessels can spend at sea.
Marine litt  er also poses widespread issues for Shetland’s croft  ers parti  cularly in terms of the cost of litt  er 
removal but also through harm to livestock and damage to property and equipment. Marine litt  er therefore costs the agricultural industry in Shetland approximately €252,331 per year
24. Since many croft  ers in Shetland 
operate on a small scale, marine litt  er puts additi  onal pressure not only on their ti  me but also on their proﬁ  t margins.

90Economic Impacts of Marine Litt  er
             Figure 14.1: Shetland’s Marine Litt  er Bill.
Shetland takes an acti  ve response to marine litt  er in the form of the annual Voar Redd Up25 where volunteers 
remove litt  er that has collected on beaches and roadsides during the year. As the largest community clean 
up event in Scotland, Da Voar Redd Up has removed well over 1,000 tonnes of litt  er and has won numerous awards including the United Nati  ons Dubai Internati  onal Award for Best Practi  ce to Improve the Living Environment. 
During the 2009 Redd Up, volunteers spent over 8,250 hours removing a total of 65 tonnes of marine litt  er 
from around Shetland. In 2009, Da Voar Redd Up cost approximately € 53,819 to run based on the value of volunteers’ ti  me and a small donati  on from BP towards operati  onal costs. This ﬁ  gure is likely to underesti  mate the total cost of the Redd Up, however, as it does not include the contributi  on of the Shetland Amenity Trust, who organise the event, or the cost of disposing of the litt  er collected, which is generally covered by Shetland Islands Council. 
Relati  vely low costs were experienced by the Shetland aquaculture industry, which accounted for just 1.2% 
of the total cost of marine litt  er to Shetland, as shown in Figure 14.2 overleaf. Similarly, the rescue services experienced relati  vely low costs since the coastguard att  ended just 1 vessel with a fouled propeller during 2008. The Lerwick Power Stati  on reported very few problems with marine litt  er and therefore incurred zero costs as a result. It was unfortunately not possible to meaningfully calculate the economic cost of marine litt  er to either the tourism industry or marinas within Shetland.
25 Da Voar Redd Up means “the spring clean” in Shetland dialect.
91Economic Impacts  of Marine Litt  er
Figure 14.2: Breakdown of the average annual cost of marine litt  er to Shetland
14.3 ConclusionMarine litt  er costs the Shetland economy between €1 million and €1.1 million on average each year, based 
on the increased costs and losses aﬀ  ecti  ng key industries that rely on the marine environment. As ﬁ  shing is one of the main industries in Shetland, it bears the brunt of these costs but this is likely to vary in other coastal communiti  es where industries such as tourism may be more important and thus aﬀ  ected by marine litt  er to a larger extent. 
As marine litt  er is a highly dynamic problem, it is inevitable that these costs will vary to some degree but it 
is important to recognise that the economic cost of marine litt  er to Shetland is both signiﬁ  cant and enti  rely unnecessary. Since Shetland represents only a single case study, these ﬁ  ndings also suggest that the total economic impact of marine litt  er on coastal communiti  es in the Northeast Atlanti  c region could be extremely high.92Economic Impacts of Marine Litt  er
15. Wider Context of the Impacts of Marine Litt  er
15.1 Introducti  on
One of the key aims of this project was to investi  gate the wider context of the impacts of marine litt  er and 
gain a deeper insight into how diﬀ  erent sectors view the marine litt  er problem. In parti  cular, the project focused on the percepti  on, sensiti  vity and prioriti  es of various sectors as regards marine litt  er and its impact on the environment. Key questi  ons were also asked about what level of marine litt  er is acceptable in the marine environment and the implicati  ons of any potenti  al rise in marine litt  er in future. Short follow up questi  onnaires were developed for each sector to investi  gate these questi  ons and these were distributed to organisati  ons that had already completed the main project questi  onnaire.
15.2 Level of litt  er in the local marine environmentAs part of the follow up questi  onnaires, organisati  ons were asked to rate the level of litt  er present in the local 
marine environment and the results are shown in Figure 15.1 below. The majority of organisati  ons surveyed during this project judged the level of litt  er in the local marine environment to be either moderate or low with 45% and 34% of organisati  ons identi  fying these levels respecti  vely. Just 13% of organisati  ons felt that the marine litt  er level was very low while a very small minority suggested that the marine litt  er level was high or very high in their areas.
Figure 15.1: Level of litt  er in the local marine environment
15.3 Impact of marine litt  er15.3.1 Organisati  ons aﬀ  ected by marine litt  er and types of impactMarine litt  er aﬀ  ected 62.2% of the organisati  ons surveyed as part of this project and two common themes 93Economic Impacts  of Marine Litt  er
emerged in the ways these organisati  ons are aﬀ  ected by marine litt  er. For many organisati  ons, this was 
a questi  on of the increased resources and expenditure necessary to remove marine litt  er and prevent it from having any further impacts upon their organisati  on. Other organisati  ons observed that the presence of marine litt  er was already having an eﬀ  ect on their organisati  on in terms of reduced trade, catch or visitor numbers. Several organisati  ons also used a combinati  on of both these reasons to describe how marine litt  er had aﬀ  ected them. Examples of how organisati  ons are aﬀ  ected by marine litt  er include:
“Apart from visual impact and threat to environment, litt  er collecti  on is a manpower issue.” • 
(Harbour)“Providing ﬁ  nancial support and assistance to local community groups and organisati  ons in beach • 
cleanup initi  ati  ves.” (Harbour)“Marine litt  er can…result in wasted ti  me and less catch. It could also spoil the catch if it were paint” • 
(Fishing vessel)“There has been fairly regular feedback to the council that the shorefront area in the town centre • 
would be bett  er used if the amount of litt  er was less” (Municipality)“Mainly aﬀ  ected by rope, netti   ng, plasti  c sheet, packing straps occasionally wrapping around longlines • 
and dropper ropes on mussel farm sites. These can chafe oﬀ   rope droppers or at least take ti  me to disentangle and create nuisance in disposal.” (Mussel farm)“Increases the maintenance of boats, rubbish aﬀ  ecti  ng the propellers, ﬁ  lters etc. For this reason the • 
harbour launch removes rubbish build-up in the marina and this means extra work” (Marina)“Harbour staﬀ   has litt  er retrieval/cleaning duti  es built into their daily work routi  nes thus aﬀ  ecti  ng • 
other operati  onal duti  es. Negati  ve impact on visitors/tourists. Environmental concerns in terms of damage to marine eco-systems. Damage caused to vessel propulsion systems. Direct/indirect costs to the Harbour when enforcing harbour byelaws on oﬀ  enders – ti  me/eﬀ  ort/money etc.” (Harbour) “The knock-on eﬀ  ect in the enjoyment of visitors, from tourists to local people, to the local beaches • 
could be aﬀ  ected. The designated bathing beaches and coast around the area have to be kept regularly cleaned by employed cleansing staﬀ  , which is increased from Easter to September each year.” (Municipality)
A key issue, parti  cularly among municipaliti  es, was that public expectati  ons of beach cleanliness were increasing and becoming harder to meet. One municipality stated, “Members of the public have greater expectati  ons and want the beach to be clean.” This could cause competi  ti  on between areas with another municipality concerned that “Residents and visitors have been discouraged from using the beaches because of litt  er. When deciding which beaches to visit, tourists have chosen to go to other areas where the beaches are cleaner.” 
Another municipality directly linked this to a potenti  al reducti  on in tourist revenue, stati  ng, “Marine litt  er 
generates negati  ve comments locally and from visitors from outside the area. This can tarnish the reputati  on of tourist desti  nati  ons and therefore contribute to economic loss.” This municipality was also parti  cularly concerned about how to cost-eﬀ  ecti  vely remove marine litt  er and commented, “Some community groups do come forward to carry out voluntary collecti  ons at ‘hotspots’, but this is not sustainable and cannot resolve the problems alone.” 
Municipaliti  es and harbours accounted for the majority of organisati  ons surveyed during this stage of the 
project and there were notable diﬀ  erences between these two sectors in terms of how they were aﬀ  ected by marine litt  er. Approximately 83.3% of harbours reported that they were aﬀ  ected by marine litt  er, mainly because they either experienced additi  onal costs for removing marine litt  er or because the litt  er in the 94Economic Impacts of Marine Litt  er
harbour was unsightly. In contrast, 68.4% of municipaliti  es reported that marine litt  er did not aﬀ  ect the level 
of beach use. Municipaliti  es suggested that this was because appropriate litt  er removal measures are in place to ensure beaches remain free of litt  er and att  racti  ve to beach users.
15.3.2 Organisati  ons not aﬀ  ected by marine litt  er and reasons whyApproximately 37.8% of the organisati  ons surveyed stated that they were not aﬀ  ected by marine litt  er. One 
of the most common reasons given by organisati  ons for this is that they had suﬃ   cient litt  er removal plans and measures in place to ensure that litt  er did not have a knock on eﬀ  ect on their organisati  on. As one organisati  on stated, marine litt  er has no impact because the organisati  on has “a robust cleansing regime in place to keep on top of the debris coming ashore.” There is a valid argument, however, that these organisati  ons are actually aﬀ  ected by marine litt  er since they have adopted measures and allocated resources to deal with marine litt  er. Many organisati  ons that stated they were aﬀ  ected by marine litt  er in fact used a broadly similar reason – increased workload, resources and expenditure required to remove marine litt  er - to show how they were aﬀ  ected. 
A number of other explanati  ons were given by organisati  ons for why they were not aﬀ  ected by marine 
litt  er with several organisati  ons stati  ng that marine litt  er had no impact on them for the simple reason that “there’s not much litt  er” in their local area. For some municipaliti  es, in parti  cular, the level of litt  er present on beaches was not enough to deter tourists and visitors with one stati  ng, “we are in a high tourist area, and the level of marine litt  er is not suﬃ   cient to aﬀ  ect this”. In these cases, demand was so high that marine litt  er had very litt  le eﬀ  ect and “the public will come anyway”. Several municipaliti  es also felt that there were “very few commercial interests [in their area] that could be aﬀ  ected” by marine litt  er.
15.4 Importance of a clean and high quality marine and coastal environmentThe organisati  ons surveyed during this stage of the project were agreed that a clean and high quality marine 
and coastal environment was either ‘important’ or ‘very important’. While these groups clearly have a vested interest in ensuring the marine environment remains clean and litt  er free, they nonetheless gave a wide variety of reasons as to why a clean and high quality marine and coastal environment was important. For many organisati  ons, the local marine and coastal environment was key to the conti  nued success of the tourist industry and the contributi  on it made to the local economy. As one organisati  on commented “it is the high quality marine environment that att  racts the recreati  onal visitors (sailors, walkers and more) which sustain the local economy”. Another suggested that “without signiﬁ  cant eﬀ  orts by the local authority in terms of beach cleansing, the tourism economy would be negati  vely aﬀ  ected.”
Many organisati  ons also felt that ensuring the marine environment remained clean and free of litt  er was 
important to maintain their corporate reputati  on and meet clients’ expectati  ons. A clean marine environment was “indicati  ve of good port stewardship” according to one harbour and this type of atti   tude was generally shared by many organisati  ons. One marina commented “We try to present a high quality marine environment for our customers, who are paying a high price for leaving their very expensive vessels here with me, under my care. The customers are also bringing a lot of money to the local economy and the last thing they wish to see is a large amount of litt  er…that could potenti  ally cause damage to their vessel.” Similarly, a shellﬁ  sh producer was “reliant on [their] “clean” reputati  on, and the reality of clean water for a healthy product”.
Another key theme among the responses was that a clean and high quality marine and coastal environment 
was important for the protecti  on of ecosystems, wildlife and the environment in general. A municipality 95Economic Impacts  of Marine Litt  er
summed this positi  on up by stati  ng that it was important to maintain a “safe, natural environment for people, 
animals and birds”. Several organisati  ons also speciﬁ  cally linked this to a litt  er free environment with one harbour stati  ng “Having litt  er in the environment is horrible – it is bad for the animals that are such a delight to watch and the general environment.” For some organisati  ons, protecti  ng the marine environment also had commercial beneﬁ  ts with one ﬁ  shing vessel stati  ng “We need clean seas so that ﬁ  sh can reproduce in their natural habitat.”
Harbours and marinas placed parti  cular emphasis on maintaining a clean marine environment in order to 
ensure vessel safety. Reasons such as “A litt  ered marina could cause damage to boats” and “to avoid rope and nets from going into propellers and causing incidents that are avoidable” were common among responses from harbours and marinas. These organisati  ons were concerned about damage both to visiti  ng vessels and vessels used in the operati  on of the harbour. One harbour, for instance, stated “we operate a fast craft   and they are suscepti  ble to damage by drawing in large pieces of refuse into the water jet intakes”.
15.5 Future sensiti  vity to marine litt  erLooking to the future, organisati  ons were asked what impact any increase in marine litt  er level would have 
on their organisati  on and responses ranged from no eﬀ  ect whatsoever to extremely negati  ve impacts on organisati  ons’ core acti  viti  es. For several organisati  ons, an increase in marine litt  er would have very litt  le eﬀ  ect with one harbour stati  ng an increase in marine litt  er would have a “minimal eﬀ  ect, ships would sti  ll come and go.” Generally, these organisati  ons were also of the opinion that it would take a substanti  al increase in litt  er levels before any impact was felt. One municipality, for instance, commented that marine litt  er “would have to dramati  cally increase to directly aﬀ  ect beach usage.”
For many organisati  ons, additi  onal resources and expenditure would be required to prevent increased levels 
of litt  er having a negati  ve impact on their core acti  viti  es. Dealing with more marine litt  er would increase costs at every stage of the removal process, from collecti  on to disposal, and result in increased staﬃ   ng pressures to cope with the additi  onal workload. One harbour, for example, commented that increased levels of marine litt  er “would require more ti  me spent by harbour staﬀ   in cleaning up, leading to less ti  me for other operati  ons such as structure maintenance etc.” 
There were also concerns that increased levels of litt  er “would have increased costs not only in beach 
cleaning but in potenti  al liti  gati  on and increased liability.” This could have signiﬁ  cant ﬁ  nancial implicati  ons for organisati  ons, such as municipaliti  es, which have a statutory duty to ensure the environment remains clean and free of litt  er. In this respect, organisati  ons were also concerned about the possibility of higher insurance premiums as a result of increased levels of marine litt  er.
Several organisati  ons had deep reservati  ons, however, about their ability to meet increased costs resulti  ng 
from higher levels of marine litt  er. These organisati  ons would ﬁ  nd it diﬃ   cult to locate the necessary resources, staﬀ   and budgets to deal with an increase in marine litt  er and therefore they would be unable to prevent marine litt  er from building up and aﬀ  ecti  ng their core business. As one municipality stated, “With reducing budgets to provide clearance teams, any increase in litt  er would have an impact on the local tourist industry.” For some organisati  ons, current marine litt  er levels are already challenging to deal with and one harbour commented that “it is impossible with current labour levels to remove it and some areas remain unkempt.”
Approximately half the organisati  ons surveyed during this stage of the project reported that any increase in 
marine litt  er levels in future would have a negati  ve impact on their core acti  viti  es, including tourist numbers, 96Economic Impacts of Marine Litt  er
harbour usage and ﬁ  shing vessels’ catch. An increase in marine litt  er would, for example, “cause usage to 
drop across the board i.e. those coming for the scenery, water sports, days on the beach with the family etc. This would then have a negati  ve impact on the local economy that relies on tourists and visitors.” An increase in marine litt  er could likewise “result in the ﬁ  shing industry losing precious ﬁ  shing ti  me.”
Any increase in marine litt  er could also aﬀ  ect an organisati  on’s corporate image and potenti  ally encourage 
clients and tourists to go to another desti  nati  on. As one marina remarked, marine litt  er “is bad for business. It makes it look as if none of us care about our environment and that we ﬁ  nd polluti  on acceptable – and that cannot be the way forward. Customers vote with their feet and will go elsewhere.” 
In extremely rare cases, an increase in marine litt  er levels could put companies out of business with one 
marina commenti  ng that “Less people would want to visit the area or keep their boats with us if the area was generally litt  ered or polluted. This would, in the extreme, mean there would be no need for the marina.” Similarly, an increase in marine litt  er “could mean the end” for one aquaculture producer, due to the low currents and oxygen levels at their aquaculture sites.
15.6 What level of litt  er is acceptable in the marine and coastal environment?Developing appropriate programs and measures to tackle marine litt  er in future relies upon a clearly deﬁ  ned 
objecti  ve about the level of marine litt  er that is acceptable in the marine and coastal environment. Deﬁ  ning what consti  tutes an acceptable level of marine litt  er is also parti  cularly important in the current context given the ongoing work to determine how the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directi  ve (2008/56/EC) will be implemented. Therefore, a key aim at this stage of the project was to gather grassroots perspecti  ves on what level of marine litt  er is acceptable in the marine and coastal environment. 
Out of the 45 organisati  ons surveyed, 13 categorically stated that absolutely no litt  er was acceptable in 
the marine environment. As one marina stated “None! There is no need for litt  er at sea, or in a marina, when waste disposal is provided for at marinas and harbours alike.” There was a general view among these organisati  ons that litt  er in the marine environment was completely unnecessary and several organisati  ons had therefore adopted a “zero tolerance” approach to marine litt  er.
A further 18 organisati  ons agreed “no litt  er would 
be the ideal” but believed this was impracti  cal and that minimal levels of marine litt  er would be a more realisti  c target. As one municipality remarked, “No litt  er is acceptable. However, being pragmati  c, and knowing that we have litt  le control over what reaches our shores, I think we need to understand that there will always be a litt  le amount. It is a case of controlling what we can.” Several organisati  ons recognised that historical levels of marine litt  er would also be a barrier towards achieving minimal levels of marine litt  er with one organisati  on suggesti  ng, “There should be no new litt  ering. It is accepted that large volumes of litt  er are already present within the marine environment.”

In total, 11 organisati  ons explicitly stated that marine litt  er levels should be “the lowest possible”. For many 
organisati  ons, this was about achieving as low a level of marine litt  er as possible given the limited funds and resources available. As one harbour remarked, “the practi  caliti  es and cost constraints of achieving the acceptable and accepti  ng the reality have to be acknowledged.”  For others, “the lowest possible” level of litt  er was determined according to the level of litt  er which is acceptable to clients and visitors. Thus, for one municipality, a small amount of litt  er was acceptable since “a reasonably small degree of litt  ering on the main beaches is probably seen as reasonable by most visitors.” Organisati  ons therefore generally shared the view that the current level of marine litt  er is unacceptable. 
15.7 ConclusionAlthough organisati  ons stressed the importance of a clean and high quality environment, marine litt  er aﬀ  ects 
almost 66% of the organisati  ons surveyed during this project. Overall, marine litt  er tends to aﬀ  ect these organisati  ons in two main ways either by directly impacti  ng on their core business or through the need to remove litt  er, which requires additi  onal resources and expenditure. For many organisati  ons, however, it is diﬃ   cult to ﬁ  nd the resources and funds necessary to support the level of service provision required to ensure their area is clean and free of litt  er. 
The impact of any future increase in marine litt  er could be quite variable. At one end of the spectrum, several 
organisati  ons stated that they would not be aﬀ  ected by any increase in marine litt  er while many suggested it would put additi  onal pressure on their resources and budgets. In a few extreme cases, a signiﬁ  cant increase in marine litt  er could put the organisati  on out of business.
A key aim at this stage of the project was to determine what level of marine litt  er is acceptable in the marine 
and coastal environment and the responses ranged from no litt  er whatsoever to the minimum amount of litt  er possible. The organisati  ons surveyed during this project were therefore agreed that current levels of marine litt  er are unacceptable.  This suggests that concerted acti  on is now required at all levels to reduce existi  ng levels of marine litt  er and prevent new litt  er from entering the marine environment. 98Economic Impacts of Marine Litt  er
16. Conclusion
This research clearly demonstrates that the economic impact of marine litt  er on coastal communiti  es 
in the Northeast Atlanti  c region is considerable with many industries signiﬁ  cantly aﬀ  ected by 
marine litt  er. A key concern is the high cost marine litt  er conti  nues to pose for municipaliti  es. 
UK municipaliti  es spend approximately €18 million each year removing beach litt  er, which 
represents an increase of 37.4% over the past 10 years. Similarly, removing beach litt  er 
costs municipaliti  es in the Netherlands and Belgium approximately €10.4 million per 
year. 
For most municipaliti  es, the potenti  al economic impact of marine litt  er on 
tourism provides the principal moti  vati  on for removing beach litt  er. In 
this respect, regularly removing beach litt  er costs less than the potenti  al 
reducti  on in revenue that could result from taking no acti  on. The potenti  al 
economic impact of marine litt  er also provides a more powerful incenti  ve 
for removing beach litt  er than current legislati  on, parti  cularly in the UK. 
This suggests that more research is required into the economic costs of 
marine litt  er as this could provide a powerful tool for sti  mulati  ng and 
justi  fying acti  on to tackle the problem.
The economic impact of marine litt  er on ﬁ  sheries is also relati  vely 
high and marine litt  er costs the Scotti   sh ﬁ  shing industry between 
€11.7 million and €13 million on average each year, which is the 
equivalent of 5% of the total revenue of aﬀ  ected ﬁ  sheries. The loss 
of earnings due to reduced ﬁ  shing ti  me is of parti  cular concern given the conti  nuing EU restricti  ons on the number of days vessels can spend at sea. Marine litt  er also presents a signiﬁ  cant ongoing 
navigati  onal hazard for vessels, which is reﬂ  ected in the increasing 
number of coastguard rescues to vessels with fouled propellers both 
in the UK and Norway. In 2008, for example, there were 286 rescues 
to vessels with fouled propellers in UK waters at a cost of between 
€830,000 and €2,189,000. 
Marine litt  er clearly aﬀ  ects a wide range of industries and a case study of 
the Shetland Islands, in the United Kingdom, highlights how these costs 
can aﬀ  ect one coastal community. Overall, marine litt  er costs the Shetland 
economy between €1 million and €1.1 million on average each year. As 
ﬁ  shing is one of the main industries in Shetland, it bears the brunt of these 
costs but this is likely to vary in other coastal communiti  es where industries 
such as tourism may be more important and thus aﬀ  ected by marine litt  er to a 
larger extent. Since Shetland represents a single case study, these ﬁ  ndings also 
suggest that the total ﬁ  nancial cost of marine litt  er to all coastal communiti  es in 
the North Atlanti  c region could be extremely high. 
Several general themes also emerged in this study and these were evident in virtually 
every industry surveyed. Firstly, it is clear that in the case of marine litt  er, the polluter does 
not pay with many organisati  ons forced to ﬁ  nd the resources and funds to deal with litt  er caused 99Economic Impacts  of Marine Litt  er
by other parti  es. Similarly, it is important to acknowledge that while many of these eﬀ  orts miti  gate the short-
term impact of marine litt  er, they do not directly address the underlying marine litt  er problem. Furthermore, marine litt  er represents an additi  onal and completely unnecessary cost to these organisati  ons, many of which face increasing diﬃ   culti  es balancing service provision with limited funds. 
This study also investi  gated the wider context of the impacts of marine litt  er and in parti  cular, the sensiti  vity 
and prioriti  es of various sectors as regards marine litt  er. Although organisati  ons stressed the importance of a clean and high quality environment, marine litt  er aﬀ  ects almost 66% of the organisati  ons surveyed during this project. Overall, marine litt  er aﬀ  ects these organisati  ons either by directly impacti  ng on their core acti  viti  es or through the need to remove litt  er, which requires additi  onal resources and expenditure. The majority of organisati  ons surveyed during this project also stated that absolutely no litt  er was acceptable in the marine environment, although many recognised that achieving a minimal level of marine litt  er is perhaps a more realisti  c target. These organisati  ons were therefore agreed that current levels of marine litt  er are unacceptable.
This research also highlights that while the economic impact of marine litt  er occurs at a local level, acti  on to 
reduce it must be global. With marine litt  er originati  ng from many diﬀ  use sources, there needs to be a step change in how the problem is treated at a nati  onal and internati  onal level. As a starti  ng point, marine litt  er needs to be regarded as a pollutant on the same level as heavy metals, chemicals and oil and therefore given the same politi  cal credibility. In most countries, NGO’s and volunteers currently undertake monitoring of marine litt  er and there are no nati  onal monitoring programmes, as there are for other pollutants. The level of resources committ  ed to tackle marine litt  er by states is also far less than for other pollutants although, as we have shown here, the impacts can be signiﬁ  cant. 
At a broader level, we also need to consider the way we design and treat products, especially those made 
of plasti  c, with too many currently designed for one use and then thrown away. In the Northeast Atlanti  c, plasti  cs make up 80-62% of marine litt  er and yet we conti  nue to design and develop disposable products that encourage litt  ering. Systems need to be implemented to place value on these products to encourage their reuse and encourage manufacturers to design them for reuse and recycling. There are already several initi  ati  ves, such as deposit schemes and reverse vending, which incenti  vise the reuse of plasti  c bott  les and these could be extended to include a wider range of plasti  c containers. For higher value items, extended produce responsibility should be adopted with ﬁ  shing nets, for example, rented by the producers rather than sold. The net would then be returned at the end of its life and it would be the producer’s responsibility to recycle them, reducing the temptati  on to dispose of them at sea. 
The enforcement of litt  er legislati  on also needs to be improved if the sources of marine litt  er are to be 
signiﬁ  cantly reduced. The dumping of all plasti  c at sea is banned under MARPOL Annex V, for example, but with poor enforcement and insigniﬁ  cant ﬁ  nes, it holds very litt  le deterrent for polluters. Despite holding Special Area status under MARPOL Annex V, the North Sea remains polluted by large quanti  ti  es of plasti  c and other litt  er. Similarly, the provisions of the EU Port Waste Recepti  on Directi  ve must be improved to include all vessels, introduce signiﬁ  cant ﬁ  nes and ensure that those who break the law can be prosecuted. In principle, current legislati  on does much to reduce marine litt  er but in practi  ce, stronger networks of enforcement and signiﬁ  cant ﬁ  nes are required to realise the full potenti  al of these regulati  ons.
These challenges are not new but the way we address them must be if we are to signiﬁ  cantly reduce marine 
litt  er. What is clear is that without strong acti  on to tackle the sources of marine litt  er, the costs associated with it will conti  nue to rise.100Economic Impacts of Marine Litt  er
