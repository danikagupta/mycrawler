1. Abstract 
In the periplasm of Escherichia coli, Dsb proteins catalyze disulfide bond formation, 
isomerisation, and reduction. DsbA and DsbB constitute the oxidative pathway that is 
responsible for the formation of  disulfide bonds. DsbD has a cen tral function in the reductive 
pathway: it transfers electrons from the cytosolic thioredoxin sy stem across the inner 
membrane to the periplasm. These reducing equivalents are utilized for disulfide bond 
isomerization (involving DsbC a nd DsbG) and for reduction of the c-type apocytochromes 
prior to heme ligation (involving CcmG and CcmH). DsbD consists of three domains:  two 
periplasmic domains in the N- and C-terminal  region (nDsbD and cDsbD) and a central 
transmembrane (TM) domain. Each of these domai ns contains a pair of essential cysteines: 
C103/C109 in nDsbD, C163/C285 in the TM do main, and C461/C464 in cDsbD. It was 
postulated that the catalytic mechanism of DsbD is based exclusively on intra- and 
intermolecular disulfide exchange reactions. Acco rding to the existing m odel, electrons flow 
successively from thioredoxin to the TM domain of DsbD, then to cDsbD, nDsbD, and finally 
to the periplasmic substrate proteins. Availabl e structural information on DsbD included the 
crystal structure of oxidized nDsbD and of th e mixed disulfide between nDsbD and DsbC. In 
addition, a crystal structure of oxi dized cDsbD had been reported. 
In this thesis, the catalytic mechanism of DsbD was studied using biophysical and 
biochemical techniques. To study the intrin sic physical properties of the individual 
periplasmic domains of DsbD, isolated nDsbD and cDsbD were overexpressed and purified to 
homogeneity. The determined redox potenti als of –232 mV and –235 mV, respectively, 
demonstrate that electron transfer from thioredoxin (E 0` = –270 mV) via DsbD to DsbC (E 0` = 
–140 mV) is thermodynamically driven. The direction of the electron flow from the 
periplasmic domains of DsbD to DsbC was confirmed in vitro  by reversed phase HPLC 
analysis of acid-quenched reaction products. The overall electron flow from cDsbD red to 
nDsbD ox and finally to DsbC ox is rapid at 25°C and pH 7.0. Complete reduction of DsbC is 
achieved within about 500 s when low initial protein concentrations of 0.25 μM are used. 
Direct reduction of DsbC by cDsbD is extremely slow ( kapp = 57 M-1s-1). As expected, reverse 
electron transfer from DsbC red to nDsbD ox or cDsbD ox does not occur.  
We then measured the kinetics of all f unctional and non-functiona l disulfide exchange 
reactions between different Dsb proteins. Th e very fast electron transfer from nDsbD red to 
DsbC ox or DsbG ox (kapp = 4 x 106 M-1s-1 and k app = 2 x 106 M-1s-1, respectively) ensures 
effective reduction of these proteins by DsbD in vivo . In contrast, one of the fastest 
nonfunctional reactions, reduction of DsbA  by nDsbD, is >1000-fold slower ( kapp = 900 M-1s-Abstract  3 
1). Based on the kinetic data, we can conclude that  large kinetic barriers separate the oxidative 
DsbA/B and the reductive DsbC/D syst ems and guarantee their independence. 
We next showed that C109 and C461 form  an inter-domain disulfide bond between 
nDsbD and cDsbD. This finding allowed crysta llization and structure determination of the 
kinetically stabilized mixed disulfide comple x between the C103S variant of nDsbD and the 
C464S variant of cDsbD (nDsbD-SS-cDsbD) that represents an essentia l intermediate in the 
catalytic cycle of DsbD. Comparison of the cr ystal structure of nDsbD-SS-cDsbD with the 
known structure of the complex between nDsbD and DsbC revealed a strong overlap between 
the surface areas of nDsbD that interact w ith DsbC and cDsbD. Consequently, electron 
transfer from cDsbD to DsbC via nDsbD must involve large relative do main movements. We 
also solved crystal structures of oxidized a nd reduced cDsbD and compared them with the 
cDsbD structure in the nDsbD-SS-cDsbD complex. cDsbD appears to be a very rigid protein 
that does not undergo significant conformational changes upon disulfide exchange.  
Finally, we proved that DsbD rapidly and directly transfer s electrons to the reductase 
CcmG, and showed that another Ccm protein, CcmH, is not required for this process. For 
kinetic and structural studies , we produced CcmG as a soluble protein that lacks the N-
terminal transmembrane helix. Using stopped-fl ow fluorescence measurements, we showed 
fast electron transfer from nDsbD to soluble CcmG in vitro  (kapp = 4 x 105 M-1s-1). We also 
synthesized the mixed disulfide complex betwee n the C103S variant of nDsbD and the C83S 
variant of soluble CcmG (nDsbD-SS-CcmG) and de termined its crystal structure. Comparison 
of the X-ray structures of all three mixed disulfide complexes of nDsbD (nDsbD-SS-DsbC, 
nDsbD-SS-cDsbD, and nDsbD-SS-CcmG) revealed the structural basis for the intriguing ability of nDsbD to interact specifically and very rapidly with different ta rget proteins such as 
the membrane-anchored monomer CcmG and the periplasmic dimers DsbC and DsbG. 4  Introduction  
2. Introduction 
2.1 Oxidative protein folding in bacteria 
Oxidative protein folding is a composite pr ocess by which a reduced, unfolded protein 
acquires both its native disulfide bo nds and native structure (Narayan  et al. , 2000). Failure to 
form proper disulfide bonds, or their slow forma tion in the cell, is likel y to lead to protein 
aggregation and degradation by proteases. In gram-negative bacteria, disulfide bonds are 
formed in the oxidizing environment of the peri plasm. It has been estimated that more than 
half of the periplasmic and membrane protei ns contain at least one disulfide bond (Haebel  et 
al., 2002; Hiniker and Bardwell, 2004; Kim  et al. , 2003). In vitro , disulfide bonds can be 
formed spontaneously by molecular oxygen, but th e rate of this spontaneous formation is 
much slower than the rate  of disulfide bond formation in vivo  (Anfinsen, 1973; Saxena and 
Wetlaufer, 1970). Moreover, the number of possi ble disulfide cross-li nks increases by around 
one order of magnitude with each additional cystei ne pair. This means that a protein with four 
pairs of cysteine residues has le ss than a 1% chance of attaining the correct four disulfides by 
random oxidation. Indeed, oxi dative protein folding in vivo  is catalyzed by a variety of thiol-
disulfide oxidoreductases and requires two enzymatic activitie s: disulfide bond formation and 
isomerization of non-native disulfide bonds. 
 
2.2 The superfamily of thioredoxin-like proteins  
Thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases that catalyze di sulfide bond formation and isomerization in 
Escherichia coli  belong to the thiore doxin superfamily. These pr oteins share two common 
features: they contain an active site with a C- X-X-C motif (where X is any amino acid) and an 
overall structure known as the thioredoxin fo ld. The thioredoxin fold was named after 
thioredoxin, in which it was first observed (M artin, 1995). However, the thioredoxin fold is 
somewhat smaller than thioredoxin itself a nd consists of a ce ntral four-stranded β -sheet with 
three flanking α-helices (Fig. 1). The th ioredoxin fold comprises a bout 80 core residues, but 
each of the proteins containing it possesses extra residues in addition to the core. Certain sites 
in the thioredoxin fold can tolerate insertions  without disruption of the overall structure 
(indicated with asterisks in Fig. 1). Thiore doxin is a monomeric 108-residue single-domain 
protein that, in addition to the thioredoxin fold, has a β-strand and a α-helix at the N-terminus 
(Fig. 2) (Katti et al. , 1990). The periplasmic dithiol oxidase DsbA from E. coli   is a 189-
residue monomer with two distinct do mains – a thioredoxin domain and an α-helical domain, 
which is inserted into the thioredoxin fold between β2 and α2 (Martin  et al. , 1993).

residues are shown in yellow. (Heras  et al. , 2004; Katti et al. , 1990; Martin  et al. , 1993; McCarthy  et al. , 2000) 
 6  Introduction  
Finally, the periplasmic disulf ide isomerase DsbC and its homologue DsbG are homodimers 
of 216 and 231-residue subunit, respectively, cons isting of a N-terminal dimerization domain 
and a C-terminal thioredoxin domain (Heras  et al. , 2004; McCarthy et al. , 2000). Despite the 
common C-X-X-C active site motif and the overa ll structural similarity, the individual 
members of the thioredoxin superfamily show lo w sequence identity and vary widely in their 
oxidizing power and therefore in  their function (Martin, 1995). 
 
2.3 Mechanism of thiol-disulfide exchange 
Oxidation and reduction of disulfide bonds is mediated by fast thiol-disulfide exchange 
between the active site cysteines of an enzyme and the cysteines of a substrate protein. The 
catalytic mechanism of thioredoxin-like thiol-di sulfide oxidoreductase s involves cycling of 
their active site cysteine residues between  the reduced and disulfide-bonded forms, via an 
intermediate with a mixed disu lfide bond between the catalyst and the substrate protein (Fig. 
3) (Darby and Creighton, 1995; Frech  et al., 1996; Kallis and Holmgren, 1980).  
Figure 3. Thiol-disulfide exchan ge reaction between proteins.  (Sevier and Kaiser, 2002) 
In the C-X-X-C motif of thiore doxin-like proteins, only the N-terminal cysteine is exposed to 
solvent, and able to form mixed disulfide w ith protein substrates. The reaction rates of 
disulfide exchange between a thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase and a peptide substrate vary 
between 103-107 M-1s-1 (Darby et al. , 1998), which is several orders  of magnitude faster than 
disulfide exchange between alkyl thiols (10-103 M-1s-1)(Shaked  et al. , 1980; Szajewski and 
Whitesides, 1980). Factors that determine the reaction rates are the p Ka of the N-terminal 
active site cysteine, the effective concentratio n and accessibility of the thiol or disulfide 
groups in the substrate, and the chem ical enviroment of  the active site.

2.4 p Ka values, redox properties, and C-X-X-C motifs of thioredoxin-like proteins 
Only deprotonated thiols can act  as nucleophiles in disulfide ex change reactions. The extent 
of thiol ionization at any particular pH and, co nsequently, its intrinsic chemical reactivity are 
determined by the p Ka of the thiol (Holmgren, 1985; Ko rtemme and Creighton, 1995; Nelson 
and Creighton, 1994). Moreover, the pK a values also determine the intrinsic reactivity of the 
sulfur atoms even when they are involved in a disulfide bond (C reighton, 1975; Szajewski 
and Whitesides, 1980). Thus the p Ka values of all sulfurs affect the rates and direction of 
disulfide exchange reactions. Bio physical studies on DsbA (Grauschopf  et al. , 1995; 
Hennecke et al., 1997; Huber-Wunderlich and Glockshuber, 1998; Jacobi  et al. , 1997; Nelson 
and Creighton, 1994) and thioredoxin (Chivers  et al. , 1996; Dyson  et al. , 1997; Mossner  et 
al., 1998) revealed that the p Ka value of the nucleophilic, N-term inal cysteine thiol of the C-
X-X-C motif is a critical factor for the redox properties of thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases. In 
DsbA, the extremely low p Ka value (~3.5 compared to a value of 9.5 for a normal cysteine) of 
the nucleophilic thiol stabilizes the reduced state of the active site and explains the 
observation that reduced DsbA is 23 kJ/mol more stable than oxidized DsbA (Grauschopf  et 
al., 1995; Hennecke et al., 1997; Nelson and Creighton, 1994; Wunderlich and Glockshuber, 
1993; Zapun et al. , 1993). The very low p Ka implicates that the nucleophilic thiol of DsbA is 
fully ionized and reactive at physiological pH, explaining th e high rate of disulfide 
interchange. These features make DsbA a very strong oxidase. In contrast, thioredoxin is the 
most reducing member of the family and its nucleophilic thiol possesses a p Ka value of about 
7.1 (Mossner  et al. , 1998). For various DsbA and thioredoxin  active site variants and also for 
the wild type proteins, a co rrelation between increased re dox potentials and decreased p Ka 
values of the nucleophilic active site thiols was observed (Grauschopf  et al. , 1995; Huber-
Wunderlich and Glockshuber, 1998; Mossner  et al. , 1998). It has been demonstrated that the 
dipeptide sequence between the active-site  cysteines strongly influences the p Ka values and 
redox properties of thiore doxin-like thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases (Chivers  et al., 1996; 
Grauschopf  et al. , 1995; Holst  et al., 1997; Huber-Wunderlich and Glockshuber, 1998; 
Krause  et al., 1991; Mossner  et al. , 1998; Mossner  et al. , 1999; Rossmann  et al. , 1997). For 
example, a proline that follows  the nucleophilic cysteine in th e active site motif of DsbA 
(Table 1) seems to be responsible for the oxi dizing power of DsbA, wh ereas a proline residue 
at the second position of the dipeptide is typi cal for the reductant th ioredoxin (Kortemme and 
Creighton, 1995; Mossner  et al. , 1998).

In addition, a histidine residue at the second position of dipeptide appears to stabilize the 
thiolate anion of DsbA and contribute to its low p Ka (Guddat  et al., 1998). Indeed, 
replacement of the X-X dipeptid e in DsbA or thioredoxin by th e active site sequence of other 
thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases shifts the p Ka values towards the corresponding value of 
related enzyme. The X-X dipeptid es are characteristic for th e individual members of the 
thioredoxin superfamily (Table 1). 
 
2.5 Disulfide bond formation and isomerization in Escherichia coli  
2.5.1 The Dsb protein family 
In the periplasm of E. coli , formation and isomerisation of disulfide bonds is catalyzed by Dsb 
proteins that constitute two independent pathways (Fig. 4). The oxidative DsbA/DsbB 
pathway is responsible for disulfide bond formation (Bardwell  et al. , 1991; Bardwell  et al. , 
1993; Dailey and Berg, 1993). The oxidizing power utilized by th is pathway comes from the 
membrane-embedded electron transport system. The reductive DsbC/DsbD pathway

guaranties efficient disulfid e bond isomerization (Bolhuis  et al. , 1999; Krupp  et al. , 2001; 
Missiakas et al. , 1995; Rietsch  et al. , 1997; Stewart  et al. , 1999). The reducing equivalents 
required for maintance of the catalytically acti ve, reduced state of DsbC originate from the 
cytosolic thioredoxin system. 
 
2.5.2 The periplasmic dithiol oxidase DsbA 
 DsbA was the first identified bacterial pr otein required for disulfide bond formation in vivo  
(Bardwell  et al. , 1991; Kamitani  et al. , 1992). It was observed that dsbA− strains are 
hypersensitive to benzylpenicillin, d ithiothreitol and me tals (Missiakas et al. , 1993; Stafford  
et al. , 1999). They show reduced le vels of several secreted pr oteins such as the outer-
membrane protein OmpA, alkaline phosphatase, and β-lactamase (Bardwell et al. , 1991). 
They do not exhibit motility because of lack of the properly assembled flagellar motor (Dailey 
and Berg, 1993). In addition, dsbA mutants of many pathogenic bacteria are avirulent since 
virulence components such as pili and toxins are not properly folded and/or assembled (Peek 
and Taylor, 1992). DsbA is a strong oxidase that very rapidly and randomly introduces 
disulfide bonds into a wide variety of subs trate proteins. Recently, Hiniker and Bardwell 
identified 10 cysteine-containing proteins from the E. coli periplasm that are in vivo  substrates 10  Introduction  
of DsbA. Six of these proteins (PhoA, DppA, Rn ase I, FlgI, HisJ, and LivJ) contain at least 
one known structural disulf ide bond (Hiniker and Bardwell, 2004). Upon oxidation of 
substrate polypeptides, DsbA becomes redu ced and is re-oxidized  by DsbB (Bardwell  et al. , 
1993; Guilhot  et al. , 1995; Kishigami et al. , 1995; Kishigami and Ito, 1996).  
 
2.5.3 DsbB recycles oxidized DsbA 
In 1993, three groups independently identified and characterized the E. coli dsbB  gene, whose 
protein product was required for disulfide bond fo rmation in periplasmic proteins (Bardwell  et 
al., 1993; Dailey and Berg, 1993; Missiakas  et al. , 1993). dsbB  mutants exhibit the same 
pleotropic phenotype as dsbA  mutants, suggesting that both  proteins belong to the same 
oxidation pathway (Missiakas  et al. , 1993). This hypothesis was c onfirmed by the observation 
that in dsbB – strains DsbA accumulates in the reduced st ate, while in wild type strains DsbA 
is completely oxidized (Kishigami  et al. , 1995). The isolation of a DsbA-DsbB mixed-
disulfide complex confirmed that DsbA and DsbB interact directly (Guilhot  et al. , 1995; 
Kishigami et al. , 1995). In addition, Bader and coworkers showed rapid direct  re-oxidation of 
DsbA by DsbB in vitro  (Bader et al. , 1998). DsbB is a 20 kDa inner membrane protein (Fig. 
5), predicted to have four transmembrane helices and two periplasmic loops (Jander et al. , 
1994). DsbB has four essential cysteine residues – one pair in each of the periplasmic loops 
(Guilhot  et al. , 1995; Kishigami et al. , 1995; Kishigami and Ito, 1996; Kobayashi  et al. , 1997; 
terminal cysteine pair (C104-C130), which has a redox potential of –186 mV, and then to the Kobayashi and Ito, 1999). The electrons from reduced DsbA first flow to the DsbB C-
Figure 5. Membrane topology of DsbB.  DsbB is predicted to consist of four transmembrane helices and two 
periplasmic loops each containi ng a pair of essential cysteines. The re dox potentials of cysteine pairs C41-C44 
and C104-C130 are – 69 mV and – 186 mV, respectively (Grauschopf  et al. , 2003).  
 Introduction   11 
 
N-terminal cysteine pair (C41-C44) with  a redox potential of  –69 mV (Grauschopf  et al. , 
2003). Re-oxidation of the N-terminal cysteine  pair occurs through ubiquinone, which, under 
aerobic conditions, donates the el ectrons to cytochrome oxidase s and finally to oxygen (Bader  
et al. , 1999; Bader  et al. , 2000). Under anaerobic conditions the electrons are passed from 
DsbB to menaquinone and then to fu marate or nitrate reductase (Bader  et al. , 1999). Using 
purified components, Bader and coworkers s howed that quinones could act as direct 
recipients of electrons from DsbB (Bader  et al. , 1999). Thus, DsbB has the novel ability to 
generate a disulfide bond in DsbA by reduction of quinones. 
 
2.5.4 The protein disulfide isomerase DsbC   
troduce wrong disulfide bonds into substrate It has been demonstrated that DsbA can in
proteins and therefore trap the pr oteins in nonnative conformations both in vitro  and in vivo  
(Bader et al. , 2000; Hiniker and Bardwell, 2004). The inco rrectly formed disulfides must be 
isomerized to the native conformation to allow pr oper folding of the proteins. The first step in 
the discovery of the isomerization pathway in  prokaryotes was the identification of the 
periplasmic protein disulfide isomerase DsbC (Missiakas  et al. , 1994; Shevchik  et al. , 1994). 
The E. coli dsbC gene was isolated independently by sc reening for dithiothreitol-sensitive 
mutations (Missiakas  et al., 1994) and as a suppressor of a dsbA null phenotype (Shevchik  et 
al., 1994). Like dsbA – and dsbB – strains, dsbC  mutants are defective in disulfide bond 
formation, but the defect in absence of DsbC is much milder (Rietsch  et al. , 1996). For 
instance, mutations in DsbC neither affect cell motility nor the formation of OmpA and β-
lactamase. The function of DsbC was established using in vitro  folding assays with model 
substrate polypeptides and confirmed in expre ssion studies of exogenous proteins in various 
dsb– backgrounds (Darby  et al. , 1998; Joly and Swartz, 1997; Rietsch et al., 1996; Rietsch  et 
al., 1997; Sone  et al. , 1997; Zapun et al. , 1995). It was found that DsbC is required for the 
correct folding of proteins with multiple disu lfide bonds. Moreover, Joly and Schwartz (1997) 
demonstrated that overproduction in E. coli of heterologous proteins with consecutive 
disulfide bonds did not require  DsbC, whereas the yield of proteins with nonconsecutive 
bridges was decreased by 50% in dsbC – strains (Joly and Swartz, 1997). Recently, Hiniker 
and Bardwell have shown that two E. coli  periplasmic proteins, RNase I (4 disulfide bonds) 
and MepA (6 conserved cysteines), are in vivo  substrates of DsbA and DsbC (Hiniker and 
Bardwell, 2004). The quantity of RNase I and MepA was dramatically decreased in dsbA – 
and dsbC – strains. In contrast, the levels of two other DsbA-dep endent proteins (PhoA and 
DppA) were unchanged in dsbC – strains. PhoA and DppA cont ain only consecutive disulfide 
 12  Introduction  
bonds, whereas RNase I contains one non-cons ecutive disulfide bond in addition to three 
consecutive ones. So far the disulfide c onnectivity of MepA remains unknown. These 
findings suggest that DsbC is required for the folding of prot eins with at least one non-
consecutive disulfide bond, wher eas DsbA is important for di sulfide bond formation in all 
disulfide-containing proteins tr anslocated to the periplasm. The proposal that disulfide bond 
connectivity determines whether a protein requires DsbC for its proper folding got further 
support in the work of Berkmen and colleagues (Berkmen  et al. , 2005). The authors showed 
that acid phosphatase phytas e (AppA) that has one non-cons ecutive disulfide bond requires 
DsbC for its proper folding. However, the activity of an AppA variant lacking the non-
consecutive bond is DsbC-independent. Additionally, a homolog of AppA that contains only consecutive bonds and does not need DsbC beco mes DsbC-dependent upon engineering of a 
non-consecutive bond. DsbC is a V-shaped h
omodimeric isomerase that belongs to the thioredoxin superfamily. 
disulfide bo ides (McCarthy  et al. , Each DsbC subunit consists of an N-term inal dimerization domain and a C-terminal 
thioredoxin domain with a C-G-Y-C motif . Sun and Wang (2000) showed that the 
dimerization of DsbC is required for its function in vivo  (Sun and Wang, 2000). The crystal 
structure (Fig.6) revealed that DsbC combines two basic features requ ired for disulfide bond 
isomerase activity, namely a thiolate active site that can attack and reshuffle substrate

the “V”. The surface of the clef t between the two arms of the V is lined with hydrophobic and 
uncharged residues, enabling non-c ovalent binding of substrate pr oteins. It was proposed that 
the cleft can switch between open and closed conformations in order to adjust to the binding 
partner (Haebel  et al. , 2002). Substrate binding appears to pl ay a significant role in catalysis 
by DsbC (Darby et al. , 1998). The reactions between DsbC and substrate peptides occur at 
rates up to 105-fold faster than those involving DsbC and glutathione. Such rate enhancement 
might be due to considerably increased effec tive concentrations of the reacting groups upon 
peptide binding to the catalyst. In fact, mixed- disulfide complexes of DsbC and the peptides 
are 104-fold more stable than the corresponding mixed-disulfides with glutathione. In 
addition, the stability of the en zyme-peptide mixed-disulfide re lative to the stability of a 
disulfide bond in a folding prot ein favours breakage of unstable substrate disulfide bonds and 
provides the opportunity for the formation of new more stable disulfides. The intramolecular 
thiol-disulfide exchange reaction between DsbC and a scrambled protein can occur only if the 
active site cysteines of DsbC are re duced (Joly and Swartz, 1997; Rietsch  et al. , 1997). In 
vivo, reduction of DsbC is car ried out by DsbD (Missiakas  et al. , 1995; Rietsch et al. , 1997). 
In the absence of DsbD, cytoplasmic thioredoxi n or cytoplasmic thioredoxin reductase, DsbC 
is found completely oxidized in vivo  (Chung et al. , 2000; Katzen and Beckwith, 2000; 
Missiakas et al. , 1995; Rietsch et al. , 1997).  
 
2.5.5 The inner membrane electron transporter  DsbD  
ts of three domains: a periplasmic N- DsbD is a 59 kDa inner membrane protein that  consis
terminal domain (nDsbD), a central transmem brane (TM) domain with  eight predicted TM 
helices, and a C-terminal domain (cDsbD) that is  again oriented towards the periplasm. The 
suggested topological structure of DsbD (Fi g. 7) was derived from a combination of in vivo  
experiments with alkaline phosphatase fu sions and computati onal algorithms for 
transmembrane sequences prediction (Chung  et al. , 2000; Gordon et al. , 2000; Stewart  et al. , 
1999). Mutational analyses showed that each of the domains contains one pair of conserved 
cysteine residues essen tial for DsbD activity in vivo (Chung et al. , 2000; Gordon  et al., 2000; 
Stewart  et al., 1999). The two invariant cysteines of the TM domain are located within the 
membrane-spanning region, C163 in TM helix 1 a nd C285 in TM helix 4 (Fig. 7). DsbD can 
be split into its th ree structural domains without loss of in vivo  activity (Katzen and Beckwith, 
2000): simultaneous expression of the three separated DsbD domains restores reduction of 
DsbC and cytochrome c maturation. However, when any of the three domains is removed 
from the system, oxidized DsbC accumulates and the formation of holocytochromes is

abolished. These results indicate that all three domains are required for DsbD activity, but do 
not need to be part of a single polypeptide. Additionally, it has been shown that both nDsbD 
and cDsbD are oxidized when the TM domain is  not present, whereas absence of nDsbD does 
not affect the redox state of the other two domains. cDsbD is required for the reduction of 
nDsbD, but not the TM domain. Taken together  these results demonstrate that electrons 
within the DsbD molecule flow from the TM domain to cDsbD and finally to nDsbD. The 
detection of apparent reaction intermediates in the form of mixed disulfides indicated direct 
electron flow from thioredoxin via DsbD to DsbC or CcmG (Katzen and Beckwith, 2000; 
Krupp et al. , 2001). In vivo , the TM domain forms a mixed disulfide with thioredoxin, and 
nDsbD forms a mixed disulfide with DsbC or Cc mG. This demonstrates that DsbD utilizes at 
least two thiol-disulfide excha nge reactions during the electr on transfer from cytoplasmic 
thioredoxin to the periplasmic substrates. Th e direct reduction of DsbC by nDsbD was 
confirmed in vitro  (Goldstone  et al. , 2001). Studies on mixed disulfides combined with 
mutational analyses allowed the specification of  DsbD cysteines involved in the reaction. 
 Introduction   15 
 
C163 of the TM domain forms a disulfide bond w ith C32 of thioredoxi n, and C109 of nDsbD 
interacts with periplasmic substrate proteins. It  was proposed that the catalytic mechanism of 
DsbD is exclusively based on inter- and intra-molecular disulfide exchange reactions. 
According to the existing model (Fig. 7), the TM domain accepts electrons from cytoplasmic 
thioredoxin and transfers them across the inne r membrane to cDsbD, followed by successive 
reduction of nDsbD and finally of DsbC, DsbG or CcmG (Chung  et al. , 2000; Katzen and 
Beckwith, 2000; Katzen  et al. , 2002; Krupp  et al. , 2001). It is likely  that a significant 
conformational change takes pl ace during the interconvertions of oxidized and reduced forms 
of the TM domain (Katzen and Beckwith, 2003; Krupp  et al. , 2001; Porat et al. , 2004), 
making the membrane-embedded cysteines alternatively accessible to the cytoplasm or to the periplasm. It is assumed that in  the reduced state, th e catalytic cysteines of the TM domain are 
accessible from the periplasm and available for in teraction with oxidized cDsbD, while in the 
oxidized state, the disulfide bonds are accessibl e from the cytoplasm and interact with 
reduced thioredoxin (Katzen and Beckwith, 2003; Porat  et al. , 2004). 
Recently, crystal structures of both soluble pe riplasmic domains of D
sbD and of the nDsbD-
cDsbD during electron shuttling.  DsbC mixed disulfide complex were solved. The crystal structure of oxidized nDsbD revealed 
an immunoglobulin-like fold consisting of a β-sandwich formed by two antiparallel β–sheets 
and a catalytic subdomain that is inserted  into the immunoglobulin-like fold (Fig. 8A) 
(Goulding  et al. , 2002). In the oxidized form of nDsbD,  the two active site cyteines form a 
disulfide bond between two β-strands. The active site disulfide is completely shielded from 
the environment by the active-site cap-loop  region. Importantly, the nDsbD-SS-DsbC 
complex exhibits a stoichiometry of one nD sbD monomer per DsbC homodimer (Fig. 8B) 
(Haebel et al. , 2002). This is due to the f act that nDsbD binds into the central cl eft of the V-
shaped DsbC dimer and forms specific contac ts with both catalytic domains of DsbC. 
Comparison of the complex with oxidized nDsbD revealed large conformational changes in the cap structure that regulates the accessibility of the nDsbD active site. In addition, Haebel 
and coworkers proposed that nDsbD exploits changes in the charge dist ribution of the active 
site to distinguish between oxidized and reduced  forms of DsbC. cDsbD is a thioredoxin-like 
protein with a C-V-A-C active site motif. It possesses a thioredoxin fold and shares 28% 
sequence identity with thiore doxin. cDsbD consists of six α-helices and 4 β-strands, with an 
extended N-terminal stretch (Fig. 8C) (Kim  et al. , 2003). This N-terminal stretch might serve 
as a flexible linker between the TM domain and cDsbD, allowing physical movement of

2.5.6 DsbG is a homologue of Dsb C  
sbG is another periplasmic substrate of DsbD (Bessette  et al. , 1999; Chung et al. , 2000). It 
as recently discovered on the basis of its ability to confer resistance to high concentrations 
py plasmid (Andersen  et al. , 1997). DsbG is the least D
w
of DTT, when encoded by a multico
abundant of the periplasmi c Dsb proteins (Bessette  et al. , 1999). DsbG is a homodimeric 
protein that shows 28% sequence identity a nd 56% sequence similarity to DsbC (Andersen  et 
al., 1997; McCarthy  et al. , 2000). The redox poten tials of DsbC (–140 mV) and DsbG (–129 
mV) are also similar (Bessette  et al. , 1999; Rozhkova  et al. , 2004; van Straaten  et al. , 1998; 
Zapun  et al. , 1995). Based on in vivo  and in vitro  data, it was proposed that DsbG has 
disulfide isomerase and chap erone activities (Bessette  et al., 1999; Shao  et al., 2000). Bessette 
 Introduction   17 
 
and colleagues showed that overexpression of DsbG can partially rescue the formation of 
multidisulfide proteins in a dsbC  mutant background. However, DsbG was inactive in the 
classical insulin-reduction assay and, unlike DsbC , it does not catalyze oxi dative refolding of 
RNaseA (Bessette et al. , 1999). Moreover, in contrast to DsbC, no in vivo  substrates of DsbG 
were found (Hiniker and Bardwe ll, 2004). These findings suggest that DsbG is a specialized 
disulfide isomerase with considerably differe nt substrate specificity compared to DsbC. 
Comparison of the recently solv ed structure of DsbG (Heras  et al. , 2004) with the structure of 
DsbC (McCarthy  et al. , 2000) offered clues to the differing substrate specificity of DsbG and 
DsbC. The uncharged surface of the DsbC clef t is consistent with binding of unfolded 
proteins. In contrast, the size and surface charge  of the DsbG binding sites indicate that its 
substrates are likely to be much larger than thos e of DsbC and that they could be partially or 
completely folded. 
 
2.6 The Escherichia coli  thioredoxin system 
The thioredoxin sys tem supplies a variety of substrate proteins both in the cytosol and in the 
eriplasm with reducing power (Holmgren, 1985). It is composed of cytosolic thioredoxin, 
edoxi n is a ubiquitous disulfide reductase p
thioredoxin reductase, and NADPH. Thior
responsible for maintaining proteins in their reduced state (Holmgren, 1985). It was first discovered as a hydrogen donor for ribonucleotide reductase (Laurent  et al., 1964), but later 
recognized as a general protein disulfide reductase that cont ributes to the cellular thiol-
disulfide equilibrium (Derman  et al. , 1993; Holmgren, 1985; Russel and Model, 1986). In the 
periplasm of E. coli , two different systems depend on th e reducing potential of thioredoxin: 
disulfide bond isomerization and cytochrome c maturation pathways (Bolhuis  et al. , 1999; 
Fabianek  et al. , 1999; Krupp et al. , 2001; Missiakas et al. , 1995; Rietsch  et al. , 1997; Stewart  
et al. , 1999). Upon reduction of a target protein, thioredoxin becomes oxidized and its 
reduced form is regenerated by thioredoxin reductase. Thioredoxin re ductase is a dimeric 
FAD-containing enzyme that catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of thioredoxin (for a review see (Williams, 1995)). The enzymatic mechanism of the thioredoxin system involves the transfer of electrons from  NADPH via a system of redox-act ive disulfides. Electrons flow 
from NADPH to FAD, then to the active site di sulfide of thioredoxin reductase, and finally to 
thioredoxin (for reviews see (Holmgren, 1985; Williams, 1995)). In vitro , reduction of 
thioredoxin by NADPH is very efficiently ca talysed by thioredoxin reductase with a k
cat/Km 
value of about 107 M-1s-1 (Mossner  et al. , 1999). As thioredoxin is mainly in the reduced state 
 18  Introduction  
in E. coli cells (Holmgren and Fagerstedt, 1982), it  appears that NADPH- dependent reduction 
of thioredoxin is not ra te-limiting for the cataly tic cycle of thioredoxin in vivo . 
 
2.7 Cytochrome c  maturation 
2.7.1 General

richia coli 
 E. coli , c-type cytochromes are synthesized exclus ively under anaerobi c conditions, under 
(Choe and Reznikoff, 1993; Rabin and The c-type cytochromes are solu
components of
chloroplasts. A special feature of the c-type cytochromes is the covalent attachment of the 
vinyl side groups of heme via two thioether bonds to  the cysteine residue s of the conserved C-
X-X-C-H motif in apocytochrome c (Sambongi  et al. , 1996). In the bacterial c-type 
cytochromes, the heme domain is located on the outer side of the cytoplasmic membrane 
(Thony-Meyer  et al. , 1994). Synthesis of both the apocytoc hrome and the heme occurs in the 
cytoplasm followed by their separate export across the cytoplasmic membrane (Page and 
Ferguson, 1990) and covalent atta chment of heme to the polypeptide. The heme-iron and the 
cysteines in the heme-binding motif of apocytoc hrome must be reduced prior to heme ligation 
(Sambongi  et al. , 1996). The overall post-translational pr ocess that leads to the formation of 
properly folded cytochrome c with one (or more) covalently attached heme is called 
cytochrome c maturation or biogenesis.  
 2.7.2 Cytochrome c maturation in Esche
In
which the expression of the ccm genes is induced 
Stewart, 1993; Tanapongpipat et al. , 1998). Eight genes called ccmABCDEFGH  are 
specifically required for cytochrome c maturation in E. coli  (Grove  et al. , 1996; Thony-Meyer  
et al. , 1995). In addition, it was shown that gene  products of the general secretion pathway 
(Sec-system) and cellular redox control system (the thioredoxin system  and Dsb proteins) 
contribute to efficient cytochrome c biogenesis (Crooke and Cole, 1995; Grove  et al. , 1996; 
Metheringham  et al. , 1995; Sambongi and Ferguson, 1994, 1996). Lack of DsbA, DsbB, or 
DsbD results in a cytochrome c negative phenotype (Crooke a nd Cole, 1995; Metheringham  
et al. , 1995; Metheringham  et al. , 1996; Sambongi and Ferguson, 1994, 1996), underlining 
the importance of balanced redox conditions for cytochrome c biogenesis. Ccm proteins are 
believed to form a membrane protein complex that coordinates delivery and attachment of 
heme to apocytochromes (for a review , see (Thony-Meyer, 2000, 2002)). CcmA is a 
peripheral membrane protein with a we ll-conserved ATP binding cassette (Goldman et al. , 
 Introduction   19 
 
1997a; Goldman  et al. , 1997b). CcmB, an integral membrane protein with six transmembrane 
helices, is believed to be a permease. CcmA an d CcmB seem to be the subunits of an ABC 
transporter. CcmC is an integral membrane pr otein with six predicte d transmembrane helices 
that catalyze covalent attachment of heme to CcmE (Ahuja and Thony- Meyer, 2003; Ren and 
Thony-Meyer, 2001; Schulz  et al. , 1998). Formation of the heme-binding form of CcmE is 
significantly enhanced in the presence of the small integral membrane  protein CcmD, which 
apparently stabilizes CcmE in the membrane and influences the interaction between CcmC 
and CcmE (Ahuja and Thony-Meyer, 2005; Schulz  et al. , 1999). The subsequent heme 
transfer from the holo-CcmE intermediate to apocytochrome c involves further integral 
membrane proteins, CcmF and CcmH, and also the membrane-anchored thioredoxin-like reductase CcmG (Fabianek  et al. , 1998, 2000; Reid  et al. , 2001; Schulz  et al. , 1999). Co-
immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that CcmF interacts directly with CcmE and 
CcmH, but not with apocytochrome c. This is in agreement with  the view that CcmF and 
CcmH form a heme lyase complex in which CcmH recruits the apocytochrome and CcmF 
recruits the heme moieties for ligation (Ren  et al. , 2002). As the ligation occurs in the 
oxidizing environment of the periplasm, the he me-binding cysteines of apocytochromes are 
likely to be oxidized and must be re-reduced for heme attachme nt. Bacteria have evolved a 
specific reductive pathway that utilizes the reducing power of cytoplasmic NADPH for the 
reduction of apocytochromes. In E. coli , electrons originating fr om NADPH are thought to 
flow from DsbD via CcmG and CcmH to apocytochromes c (Chung et al. , 2000; Crooke and 
Cole, 1995; Fabianek  et al. , 1998; Fabianek  et al. , 1999; Reid  et al. , 1998; Reid  et al. , 2001; 
Sambongi and Ferguson, 1994).

The hydrophilic C-terminal domain of CcmG cont ains a C-P-T-C active site motif and has a 
redox potential of about –210 mV (Li  et al. , 2001). CcmG active site cysteine residues are 
important for cytochrome c maturation (Fabianek  et al. , 1998). It has been shown that strains, 
expressing CcmG variants with one or both active  site cysteine residues replaced by serine, 
produce strongly decreased amounts of holocytochrome c. The restoration of cytochrome c 
biogenesis was achieved by addition of thiol reductants to the medium. In contrast to various 
other bacterial oxidoreductase s, CcmG does not show reductase activity in the classical 
insulin reduction assay, and its absence does not affect the activity of  alkaline phosphatase, 
 20  Introduction  
suggesting that reductase activity of CcmG is hi ghly specialized and limited to the pathway of 
cytochrome c maturation (Fabianek  et al. , 1997; Monika  et al. , 1997; Page and Ferguson, 
1997).  
The recently solved crystal structure of a CcmG homologue from Bradyrhizobium japonicum

periplasmic reductase CcmG (Fig. 4). Indeed, genetic studies showed that in the absence of 
DsbD, thioredoxin or thioredoxin reductase, cytochrome c maturation is suppressed and 
CcmG accumulates in the oxidized state (Chung  et al. , 2000; Crooke and Cole, 1995; 
Metheringham  et al. , 1996; Reid  et al. , 1998; Sambongi and Fergus on, 1994). Detection of 
 Introduction   21 
 
the mixed-disulfide intermediate between DsbD and CcmG in vivo  (Katzen and Beckwith, 
2000) is strong evidence in favour of direct electron transfer from DsbD to CcmG. The 
mechanism of further electron tr ansfer from CcmG to apocytochromes is not yet established, 
and several models exit (Reid  et al. , 2001). According to the first model, electrons 
sequentially flow from reduced CcmG to CcmH and then to apocytochromes (Monika  et al. , 
1997; Page  et al. , 1998; Reid  et al. , 2001). The observation that onl y the second (but not the 
first) cysteine in the C-X-X-C active site motif of CcmH is important for cytochrome c 
maturation led to another model for apocytochrome c reduction (Fabianek  et al. , 1999). First, 
a disulfide bond of oxidized apocytochrome c is broken by a nucleophilic attack of the second 
CcmH active site thiol, leading to a mixed disulfide between apocytochrome c and CcmH. 
This disulfide is then resolved by reduced CcmG , resulting in CcmG ox idation and release of 
reduced apocytochrome  c and CcmH. In the last step, Ds bD regenerates reduced CcmG.  
Accumulating data suggest that th e role of CcmG in cytochrome c maturation is more 
complex than solely reduction of apocytochrom es. It has been shown that CcmG active  site 
his thesis was focused on the investigatio n of the catalytic mechanism of the inner 
sbD from E. coli. First, we addressed the issue of the intrinsic 
S-CcmG mixed-disulfide complexes, wh ich would allow their crystallization and 
structu
how the two pathways are kept 
separate. If barriers did not exist, there would be a futile cycle in which, for instance, DsbD cysteine mutants are still able to produce some holocytochrome c, whereas ccmG – strains are 
completely defective in cytochrome c maturation even in the presence of reductants (Fabianek  
et al. , 1998; Fabianek  et al. , 1999; Grove  et al. , 1996; Reid  et al. , 2001; Thony-Meyer  et al. , 
1995). These results led to the conclusion that, apart from th e reduction of apocytochromes, 
CcmG might also be required for stabilization of one or several proteins involved in cytochrome c maturation (Fabianek  et al. , 1998).

Introduction 
Dsb proteins catalyse oxi dative protein folding in the periplasm of Escherichia coli . 
Formation of native disulfide bonds involve s two independent path ways: the oxidative 
DsbA/B pathway and the reductive DsbC/D pathway.1; 2 The strong dithiol oxidase DsbA 
very rapid and randomly introduces disu lfide bonds into reduced polypeptides.3; 4; 5 Upon 
oxidation of substrate proteins  DsbA becomes reduced and is re-oxidized by the inner 
membrane protein DsbB, that transfers electrons from DsbA to ubiquinone.6; 7; 8; 9 Since DsbA 
has no “proofreading” activity, rearrangement  of wrong disulfide bonds in scrambled 
polypeptides to the native disulfide pattern is catalyzed by the periplasmic disulfide isomerase 
DsbC.10; 11; 12; 13 The inner membrane protein DsbD is required for maintenance of DsbC in its 
active, reduced state in the highly oxidizing  periplasm. DsbD also supplies two other 
periplasmic proteins with reducing pow er: DsbG, a homologue of DsbC of unknown 
function14; 15; 16, and CcmG, a specialyzed thiol re ductase, essential for cytochrome c 
maturation.17  
DsbD consists of three domains: a N-terminal periplasmic domain (nDsbD) with an immunoglobulin fold,
18; 19 a central transmembrane domai n (TMD), composed of eight 
predicted transmembrane helices,20 and a C-terminal periplasmic thioredoxin-like domain 
(cDsbD).21 Each domain has two conserved cyst eine residues, essential for electron 
transport.22 It is proposed that intramolecular el ectron transfer within DsbD proceeds 
exclusively through sequential disulfide exch ange reactions between its three domains.23; 24; 25; 
26 The electron cascade starts with the reducti on of TMD by thioredoxin, then cDsbD shuttles 
electrons from TMD to nDsbD, and finally re duced nDsbD passes electrons to DsbC, DsbG 
or CcmG. 
The 1.9 Å crystal structure of oxidi zed cDsbD (residues 423–546 of mature Escherichia coli  
DsbD) revealed a thioredoxin fold w ith an extended N-terminal stretch.21 We have recently 
determined the structure of a disulfide-li nked complex between cDsbD and nDsbD (2.85 Å 
resolution), which represents an important reac tion intermediate in the catalytic cycle of 
DsbD.27  
For better understanding of th e redox mechanism of cDsbD, we determined four high-
resolution structures of cDsbD: chemically re duced (1.3 Å), pH-shifted chemically reduced 
(0.99 Å), photo-reduced (1.1 Å) , and oxidized (1.65 Å) cDsbD.  The structure of reduced 
cDsbD revealed that the active site Cys461 is protonated at pH 7.0. In order to determine the 
pKa value of Cys461, we studied the pH-depende nt reactivity of Cys461 with the alkylating 
reagent iodoacetamide and also the pH-depende nt thiolate-specific absorbance at 240 nm. Results Structural studies of cDsbD 53 
These experiments showed that cDsbD activ e site Cys461 has an unexpectedly high p Ka 
value of 9.3 for a thioredoxin-like pr otein with a redox pot ential of –235 mV.27; 28; 29 54 Structural studies of cDsbD Results  
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
Thermodynamic stabilities of  the redox forms of cDsbD 
Guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) induced unfoldi ng and refolding transitions of the oxidized 
and reduced cDsbD at 25°C and pH 7.0 were followed by fluorescence at 345 nm (excitation 
at 280 nm). The transitions were cooperative and fully reversible (Fig. 1A). Evaluation of the 
data according to the two-state model yielded ΔG-values of – 43.9( + 2.9) kJ mol-1 for cDsbD ox 
and – 45.5( + 5.0) kJ mol-1 for cDsbD red, indicating that at pH 7.0 both redox forms are equally 
stable. 
 
pKa of the active site Cys461 and reactivity with DTT  
To determine the p Ka of the nucleophilic active-site Cys 461, we first investigated the pH-
dependent reactivity of Cys 461 with iodoacetamide (IAM).6; 7; 8; 9 cDsbD red (5 μM) was mixed 
with an excess of IAM (between  0.1 mM and 10 mM) in the ra nge of pH 4-10. Samples were 
removed after different incubation times, an d the reaction was quenched with acid. The 
reaction products were separa ted by reversed-phase HPLC, a nd amounts of reduced and IAM-
modified cDsbD were quantified by integration of the peak areas. Figure 1B shows the pH-
dependence of the apparent s econd-order rate constant ( kIAM) of the alkylation of Cys461 in 
reduced cDsbD by IAM. The transition appeared to be biphasic as it had previously been 
described for thioredoxin.6; 7; 8; 9 Although this method did not provide an exact p Ka value, we 
can conclude that the p Ka of Cys461 is above 8.0. We then inves tigated the pH-dependence of 
the thiolate-specific absorbance at 240 nm.30; 31; 32 The protein solution (i nitial concentration 
of 30 μM) was titrated in the range of pH 4-12 and the absorbance at 240 nm and 280 nm was 
recorded. Far-UV CD measuremen ts proved that the secondary structure of cDsbD is not 
changed in this pH-range (data not s hown). The titration curves of cDsbD red (circles) and its 
single cysteine variant cDsbD-Cys464Ser (squares) are depicted in Figure 1C.  Both cDsbD red 
and cDsbD-Cys464Ser showed a single transitio n with a midpoint at pH 9.2-9.5. From these 
data we can conclude that Cys461 has an unusually high p Ka of about 9.3 that is similar to the 
pKa of a normal cysteine thiol. It has been shown that the p Ka of the nucleophilic active site 
thiols in DsbA and thioredoxin variants is lowered and correla tes with the redox potential of 
these enzyme.30; 31; 32 cDsbD has a redox potential of –235 mV.27; 28 Accordingly, the 
corresponding theoretical p Ka of Cys461 lies between 6 an d 7. Although the determined p Ka 
of cDsbD Cys461 deviates significantly from theory, it is  consistent with our results obtained 
by the IAM-modification method (Fig. 1B) and th e identical stabilities of both redox forms. Results Structural studies of cDsbD 55 
We also studied the reactivity of cDsbD ox with DTT at 25°C and pH 7.0. Measurements were 
carried out under pseudo-first order conditions  with initial concen trations of cDsbD ox and 
DTT of 5 μM and 1 mM, respectively. Samples were removed at different incubation times, 
and the reaction was quenched with acid. Reacti on products were separated by reverse-phase 
HPLC, and amounts of cDsbD ox and cDsbD red were quantified by inte gration of the peak 
areas. Figure 1C shows that  the reduction of cDsbD ox by DTT is in contrast to electron 
transfer between other Dsb protei ns very slow, with an appare nt second order rate constant 
(15 M-1s-1) typical for the thiol-disulfide exch ange between small organic molecules.33 
 
Crystallization of cDsbD 
Oxidized and chemically reduced cDsbD (termed cDsbD ox and cDsbD red from now on) 
crystallized under the same conditions. The first dataset collected for cDsbD ox turned out to 
be photoreduced (termed cDsbD pr from now on). A dataset of cDsbD in an intact oxidized 
state (cDsbD ox) was measured from a crystal gr own under similar conditions (see 
experimental part). In both cases the crystals grew within 3 to 5 days. cDsbD formed plate-
like crystals with dimensions of about 100 x 650 x 30 µm which were arranged in bundles and 
star-like structures. Before being removed fr om the drop the crystal bundles were separated 
into single-crystal fragments.  All crystals belong to th e orthorhombic space group P2 12121 
with similar cell parameters and contain one mo lecule per asymmetric unit. In comparison, 
the lower-resolution SeMet cDsbD crystals reported by Kim et al.  (2003)21 exhibited the same 
unit cell (resolution 2.3 Å) and the native crysta ls contained two molecules per asymmetric 
unit (resolution 1.9 Å).  
 
X-ray structure determination of cDsbD and structural quality 
The X-ray structure of cDsbD ox was first solved by molecular replacement using data from a 
crystal that diffracted to 1.1 Å and turned out to be photoredu ced by synchrotron radiation 
(cDsbD pr). The crystal packing is extremely dense w ith a very low Matthews-parameter of 1.7 
Å3Da-1.  
cDsbD pr was refined anisotropically to a resolu tion of 1.1 Å (Table 1). Given the high 
resolution of the data, hydrogen atoms could be included into the final stage of refinement. 
The final R factor is 0.148 and the free R-factor 0.174. 
To protect the catalytic di sulfide bridge of cDsbD ox from radiation damage, a second dataset 
was measured using an aluminium filter that decreased the beam intensity to 70.3 % of the 
original value. A shorter wavelength (0.751 Å) wa s chosen to reduce radiation damage to the 56 Structural studies of cDsbD Results  
disulfide bridge.34 The crystal diffracted to 1.65 Å and the disulfide bridge was found to be 
intact: no positive or negative difference density is visible at this site (Table 1). cDsbD red data 
were collected at a wavelength of 1.000 Å to a resolution of 1.3 Å.  
The fourth dataset (termed cDsbD red/pH7  from now on) was collected from a chemically 
reduced crystal with a shift to pH 7 at a wave length of 0.86 Å to a resolution of 0.99 Å using 
the same aluminium filter as described for cDsbD ox cDsbD red/pH7 was anisotropically refined to 
a resolution of 0.99 Å. Since mostly all main -chain and several side -chain hydrogen atoms 
were already visible after the f ourth refinement cycle they were  included into the refinement. 
All four final atomic models exhibit excellent Ramachandran plot statistics with all residues 
found in most favoured and addition ally allowed regions (Table 1). 
 
Overall structure and comparison of different cDsbD structures 
cDsbD possesses a thioredoxin-like fold as alr eady described. In the following we use the 
nomenclature introduced by Kim et al.  (2003).21 
The structure of cDsbD is very rigid. Except for the active-site region, systematic 
superposition of cDsbD ox, cDsbD pr cDsbD red and cDsbD red/pH7  reveals no signifi cant structural 
change. Rmsd-values for all pair s of structures lie in the 0. 17 - 0.36 Å range. The sulfur of 
Cys464 moves by 0.5 Å towards the interior of the protein upon reduction (comparing 
cDsbD ox and cDsbD red). This corresponds to a change by 11° in the χ1 angle of Cys464. For 
the accessible Cys461, the ϕ angle changes by 7° and the χ1 angle by 9°. The S-S distance in 
cDsbD red is 3.6 Å. 
Upon superposition of the cDsbD domain fr om the nDsbD-SS-cDsbD complex (termed 
cDsbD co from now on)27 onto unliganded cDsbD, only helix α2a (including the two active site 
cysteines) and Thr529 exhibit differences. In the complex, helix α2a is slightly pulled towards 
the Cap-loop region of nDsbD (Asp68-Gly72)18 probably as a conseq uence of the Cys461 
(cDsbD) - Cys109 (nDsbD) disulfide bond forma tion. The main chain carbonyl of Thr529 is 
forced by direct van der Waals interactions of  the two side chains of Phe11 and Phe108 of 
nDsbD to take up a different conformation with respect to unbound cDsbD: ϕ and φ  change 
by approximately 10° and 100° , respectively (Figure 2). 
In general, compared to nDsbD that undergoes a huge opening of the Cap-loop region upon 
complex formation,27 cDsbD exhibits only small structural rearrangements.  
 
 Results Structural studies of cDsbD 57 
Radiation driven disulfide-reduction of cDsbD pr  
The most radiation-sensitive moietie s in proteins are disulfide bonds.35; 36; 37 The first step of 
the radiation-driven opening of a disulfide bond is the tr apping of an electron (RSSR•-). 
Spontaneous and reversible bond rupture to RS• and RS- can then occur. The protonation of 
this radical (RSSRH•) shifts the equilibrium towards the broken state upon bond rupture to a 
thiol (RSH) and a thiyl radical (RS•). Figure 3 shows an overview of the disulfide opening 
mechanism.38; 39; 40; 41 
Analysis of the cDsbD pr data set shows that opening of the Cys461-Cys464 disulfide bridge 
occurs during data collection. We analysed this phenomenon by parti tioning the dataset into 
eight incremental reflection files. In the fi rst reflection file 150 di ffraction images were 
included. For every additional re flection file, the number of diffraction frames included was 
increased by 50. An independent refinement with CNS42 at 1.4 Å resoluti on was than carried 
out for each dataset. In all cases, van der Waal s interactions between the two sulfur atoms of 
the active site cysteines were made to be ignor ed during refinement in CNS. The refined S-S 
distances were found to increase at each step: from 2.44 Å for the first 150-frames reflection 
file to 2.65 Å for that containing 500 data-frames. Already for the first reflection file, opening 
of the disulfide bridge is clearly visible. The observed disu lfide distance is 0.39 Å higher than 
that observed for cDsbD ox (2.05 Å). To analyse the state of th e disulfide bridge at the end of 
the measurement two additional reflection file s were created, encompassing frames 349 to 
559 (refined S-S distance of 2.96 Å) and of fr ames 420 to 676 (refined S-S distance of 2.99 
Å). These values clearly indicate that even af ter full crystal exposure th e disulfide bridge is 
not fully reduced (for comparison: cDsbD red shows a distance of 3.56 Å). The analysis is 
summarized in Table 2. 
 
Comparison with cDsbD in other prokaryotic organisms 
18 entries for DsbD were found in a SwissProt database43 search ( www.expasy.org/sprot/ ). A 
multiple sequence alignment of the cDsbD domains from those sequences was carried out. Identical sequences were ignored for the alignment. The cDsbD sequence of Salmonella typhi , 
differing from that of Salmonella typhimurium  by only four residues, all found in highly 
variable regions, was also i gnored. As shown in Figure 4A, E. coli  has the shortest cDsbD-
sequence. Highly conserved regions (Figure 4A) are visible in the multiple sequence alignment. Except for Campylobacter jejuni  cDsbD, the active site motif is 
YADW C(V,I)(A,S) CK. C. jejuni  exhibits the active site pattern: TASW CENCK. This is 
consistent with the fact that cDsbD of C. jejuni  has the lowest sequence identity and the 58 Structural studies of cDsbD Results  
second last similarity of all sequences used. The more distant relationship of C. jejuni  cDsbD 
to the rest of the group is also indicated by phylogenetic analysis of the DsbD family and their 
homologs by Kimbal et al.44 Their tree was built using multiple sequence alignments of the 
DsbD transmembrane helices 1 to 6 using homo log sequences from all Gram-negative (G-) 
protobacteria, G-bacteria, Gram positve (G +) bacteria, Archaea, Thermatoga and 
Cyanobacteria. According to the different bran ches of the tree, the authors defined the 
different Dsb-family sequences in 17 clusters. G- proteobacteria Dsb-family proteins and 
homologs resulted in 5 clusters whereas clus ter 1 consists of G- proteobacterial DsbDs. 
Cluster contains two mean branches. The firs t branch contains the DsbD protein from N. 
meningitidis  and C. jejuni  whereas the mean branch consists of all the others (Kimbal et al.  
did not include Vibrio parahaemolyticus , Vibrio vulnificus , Salmonella typhimurium  and 
Ralstonia solanacearum  in the analysis).  
The conserved residues were mapped onto the cDsb D structure. Figure 4B indicates that most 
residues located in the bindi ng interface of cDsbD to nDsbD are highly conserved. Not 
surprisingly, hardly any conserved residue can  be found on the opposite site of the cDsbD 
surface (Figure 4C). 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
Protein purification 
(His) 6-tagged cDsbD and its single cysteine variant cDsbD-Cys464Ser (a.a numbering 
corresponds to the mature full leng th DsbD) were overexpressed in E. coli , purified, and 
protein concentration was determined as described.27  
 
Stability measurements 
GdmCl-induced unfolding and refolding of oxidized and reduced forms of cDsbD were 
performed at 25°C in 20 mM HEPES, 170 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA (pH 7.0). In the case of 
reduced cDsbD, 0.5 mM DTT was included. For unfolding, 2.5 μM protein was incubated for 
15 h with various concentrations  of GdmCl. For refolding, 125 μM protein was first denatured 
with 6 M GdmCl for 3 h at 25°C, then dilu ted 1:50 into refolding buffer with various 
concentrations of GdmCl and incubated fo r 15 h. The transitions were followed by the 
fluorescence at 345 nm (excitation at 280 nm). Da ta were evaluated according to the two-state 
model with a six-parameter fit.45 
 Results Structural studies of cDsbD 59 
HPLC measurements 
HPLC analysis was performed on an Agilent 1100 HPLC instrument equipped with a diode 
array detection system and an Agilent Zorbax 300 SB C 18 reversed-phase column (5 mM, 2.1 
x 150 mm). Different species of cDsbD were separated at 55°C w ith a linear gradient from 35 
% to 55 % (v/v) of acetonitrile in  0.1 % TFA, and detected by their absorbance at 220 nm and 
280 nm. The amounts of reduced, oxidized or IA M-modified forms of cDsbD were quantified 
by integration of the peak areas. 
 
Determination of the p Ka of the active site Cys461  
All experiments were performed at 25°C in the reaction buffer (200 mM KCL, 10 mM di-
sodium hydrogen phosphate, 10 mM boric acid, 10 mM succinic acid, 0.1 mM EDTA), 
adjusted with HCl or NaOH to pH 4–12. Redu ced cDsbD was prepared by reduction with a 
1000-fold molar excess of DTT at pH 8.0 for 30 min at room temperature, followed by 
removal of DTT by gel filtration in degassed buffer. 
The ionization of Cys461 was measured  by the pH-dependent reactivity with 
iodoacetamide (IAM).30; 46 Reactions were performed under pseudo-first order conditions with 
initial cDsbD red concentration of 5 μM, and IAM concentrations between 0.1 mM and 10 mM. 
Samples were removed after different incuba tion times. The reaction was stopped by addition 
of 0.4 volumes of 30 % (v/v) formic acid (final pH < 2), and HPLC analysis were performed 
as described. Data were evaluated according to pseudo-first order kinetics. The apparent 
second-order rate constants ( kIAM) were calculated a nd plotted against pH. 
The p Ka of Cys461 in cDsbD or cDsbD-Cys464 was alternatively measured by the 
pH-dependent thiolate-specific absorbance at 240 nm.30; 31; 32 Initial protein concentration was 
30 μM. The sample absorbance was measured agai nst air and was corrected for the dilution 
caused by pH adjustment and for the absorbance  of a protein-free refe rence solution, titrated 
in the same manner. The data was evaluate d according to the Henderson-Hasselbach equation 
as described previously.31 
 
HPLC analysis of the reactivity with DTT  
Measurements were performed under pseudo-first order conditions  with an initial 
concentration of oxidized cDsbD of 5 μM and 1 mM of DTT at 25°C in 100 mM sodium 
phosphate, 0.1 mM EDTA (pH 7.0). Samples were  removed after different incubation times, 
and reaction was stopped by addition of 0.4 volumes  of 30 % (v/v) formic acid (final pH < 2). 60 Structural studies of cDsbD Results  
HPLC analyses were performed as described. Da ta were evaluated acco rding to pseudo-first 
order kinetics and the apparent second order rate constants were calculated. 
 
Crystallization of cDsbD 
Purified cDsbD was concentrated to 19.3 mg /ml. The sitting drop vapour diffusion method 
was used for producing crysta ls. In the case of cDsbD pr and cDsbD red 1.4 µl of protein 
solution were mixed with 2 µl of precipitant  solution (0.1 M ammonium acetate, 0.2 sodium 
acetate pH 4.6, 0.1 M sodium iodide, 40 % PEG 4K and for cDsbD red additionally 0.3 mM 
TCEP HCl). The crystals used for cDsbD pH7 grew under the same condition as that the one 
used for cDsbD pr and cDsbD red, but the drop size was 2 µl (1 µl  in protein + 1 µl precipitant 
solution) each. The second cDsbD ox-crystal measured was cr ystallized in 0.3 M sodium 
acetate pH 4.6, 0.1 M sodium iodide and 40 % PE G 4K whereas 0.8 µl of protein solution 
were mixed with 2 µl of precipitant solution. In  both cases plate-like crystals grew at 4 °C 
within three to five days to maximum dimens ions for a single crystal of 130 x 500 x 30 µm.  
Reduced cDsbD was obtained by adding 3 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)pho sphine (TCEP HCl) 
to oxidized cDsbD. Crystals grew under the same conditions as described for the oxidized 
form. 
 
Data collection and structure solution 
cDsbD crystals were directly frozen in the ni trogen gas stream. No addition of cryoprotectant 
was necessary. The first diffraction data of oxidized cDsbD were collected at 90.9 K on 
beamline X06SA at the Swiss Light Source (P aul Scherrer Institut Villigen, Switzerland) 
using a MAR CCD image plate at a wavelength of 0.860 Å. This crystal was soaked in 
saturated cis-Pt(NH 2)2Cl2 for around 24 hours before mounti ng. Data were processed with 
XDS47 to a resolution of 1.1 Å. To obviate a pr oblem with the spindle acceleration the 
processed data were corrected with the program check_spindleshutt er (Kai Diederichs, 
personal communication). The stru cture of cDsbD was solved by molecular replacement with 
AMoRe48 using a truncated thioredoxin model49 (PDB-code: 2TRX) against 12 to 4 Å data. 
The truncated search model was aptly modified by visual inspection of a stereo picture of 
cDsbD superimposed on  E. coli  thioredoxin as published by Kim et al. , 2003.21 The cDsbD 
structure was auto-bui lt using ARP/wARP v650 and iteratively rebuilt in O.51 The structure 
was first isotropically re fined to 1.4 Å using CNS42 and then anisotropically refined in 
SHELXL52 to a R-factor of 0.148 and a fr ee R-factor of 0.175 (Table 1).  Results Structural studies of cDsbD 61 
Since the oxidized cDsbD dataset exhibits photo reduction of the disulfide bridge (see Results 
and Discussion), a second dataset was collected using an aluminium filter (reducing intensity 
to 70.3 % of the original valu e) with 0.751 Å wavelength and at  98.2 K temperature. Oxidized 
cDsbD data were processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK53 to 1.65 Å, respectively.  
Diffraction data for TCEP-reduced cDsbD were collected at a temper ature of 100 K with a 
wavelength of 1.000 Å. Data we re processed DENZO and SCALEPACK to a resolution of 
1.3 Å.  
A second TCEP-reduced crystal was soaked for te n minutes at room temperature in a mixture 
containing 300 µl precipitant solution (0.1 M ammonium acetate, 0.2 sodium acetate, 0.1 M 
sodium iodide pH 4.6, 40 % PEG 4K and 3 mM TCEP HCl) and 167.5 µl  titration solution 
(0.3 M HEPES base, 0.1 M NaI, 40 % PEG 4K a nd 3 mM TCEP HCl) with the final pH of 
7.0. Diffraction data for TCEP-reduced and pH shifted cDsbD (cDsbD red/pH7 ) were collected at 
a temperature of 100 K with a wavelength of 0.9718 Å. The dataset was processed with 
DENZO and SCALEPACK to a resolution of 0.99 Å. All cDsbD crystals (oxidized and 
TCEP-reduced) belong to space group P2 12121 and contain one molecule per asymmetric unit 
(Table 1). 
The position of iodide ions from NaI (in the model of cDsbD ox, cDsbD red and cDsbD red/pH7 ) 
were identified by analysis of Bijvoet differe nce Fourier map taking also in account of the 
environment of the major difference peaks. 
 
Stereochemical analysis 
The stereochemistry of all four cDsbD structures was checked with WHAT_CHECK54 and 
PROCHECK.55 The photo-reduced and the pH shifte d TCEP reduced stuructures were 
additionally checked with the Protein Anisotro pic Refinement Validation and Analysis Tool 
(PARVATI56, http://www.bmsc.washington.edu/parvati/parvati.html ). All structural figures 
were prepared using PyMOL57 (http://www.pymol.org ). 
 
 
Analysis of the disulfide opening 
The opening of the active site disulfide br idge was analysed by partitioning the cDsbD pr-
dataset into eight reflection files. In the fi rst reflection file 150 diffraction images were 
included. An increment of 50 frames was used  for every additional reflection file. Every 
dataset was then independe ntly refined with CNS42 and van der Waals interactions between 
the two sulfurs of Cys461 and Cys464 were ma de to be ignored. For each model the S-S 62 Structural studies of cDsbD Results  
distance was measured using the program O.58

Figure 1.  Biophysical properties of cDsbD. ( A) GdmCl-induced folding and unfolding 
transitions of oxidized (circl es) and reduced (squares) cDsb D at 25°C and pH 7.0. Unfolding 
(filled symbols) and refolding (open symbols)  were followed by the fluorescence at 345 nm 
(excitation at 280 nm). Original data were evaluated according to the two-state model and 
normalized. Solid and dashed lines represent the fit for cDsbD ox and cDsbD red, respectively. 
The obtained m-values of 15.9( + 1.1) kJ mol-1 M-1 and 17.5( + 1.9) kJ mol-1 M-1 and ΔG of – 
43.9( + 2.9) kJ mol-1 and –45.5( + 5.0) kJ mol-1 for the oxidized and reduced forms, 
respectively, are very similar. ( B) pH-dependence of the active site Cys461 reactivity with

described in Methods. ( C) The pH-dependence of the ioniza tion of the Cys461 thiol of cDsbD 
(circles) and cDsbD-Cys464Ser (squares). The th iolate-specific absorban ce was monitored at 
240 nm and the fraction of the thiolate anion wa s calculated as describe d in Methods. The fit 
(solid line) yields a p Ka value of 9.4 for cDsbD and 9.3 for cDsbD-Cys464Ser. (D) Very low 
reactivity of cDsbD with DTT at 25°C and pH 7.0. The reduction of cDsbD by DTT was 
performed under pseudo-first order conditions with initial concentrations of 5 μM for 
cDsbD ox and 1 mM for DTT. The amounts of the reduced and oxidized cDsbD species after 
different incubation times were qu antified by reversed-phase HPLC. The fit (solid line) yields 
a pseudo-first order rate constant of 0.0154 s-1 that corresponds to a second-order rate

3.4 Rapid reduction of DsbG by  nDsbD (unpublished results) 
To gain the complete picture on the kinetics of  the disulfide exchange reactions performed by 
nDsbD, we also determined kinetic parameters of the reduction of DsbG by nDsbD. As in the 
case of DsbC (3.9 x 106 M-1s-1), the reaction is extremely fast, with a rate constant of 1.9 x 106 
M-1s-1 (Fig. 10, 11). To test whether the fast electr on transfer from nDsbD to DsbC or DsbG is 
due to their dimerization state, we measured kinetics of the disulfide exchange between 
nDsbD and the isolated catalytic domain of Ds bC (DsbC-C) or DsbG (DsbG-C). Reduction of 
DsbG-C by nDsbD proved to be 10 times slower (2.0 x 105 M-1s-1, Fig. 12 B) than the 
reaction between DsbG and nDsbD, which could be caused by lowered effective 
concentration of the active site cysteines in  DsbG-C compared to DsbG. Surprisingly, 
disulfide exchange between DsbC-C and nDsbD is an extremely slow process with a second-
order rate constant of 3.6 x 103 M-1s-1 (Fig. 12 A, the data were provided by Patrick Frei). 
Thus, dimerization of DsbC is likely requ ired for its efficien t reduction by nDsbD in vivo , 
rather than for protection active sites of Ds bC from DsbB-mediated oxidation as it was 
proposed earlier (Bader  et al. , 2001). Overall, through dimerization DsbC gains the second 
binding site that interacts with the same nDsbD molecule (Fig. 8B) (Haebel et al. , 2002), 
which dramatically increases the affinity.  3.123.143.163.183.23.223.24

 78  Oxidative protein folding in eukaryotes versus E. coli  
4. Oxidative protein foldin g in eukaryotes versus E. coli: analogies and 
differences 
In eukaryotes, folding and asse mbly of secretory and membrane  proteins cont aining disulfide 
bonds take place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The environment of the ER lumen 
provides the pH and redox conditions require d for folding. A growing family of ER 
thioredoxin-like oxidoreductases is  thought to be responsible for the formation of native 
disulfide bonds in the ER. Protein disulfide is omerase (PDI) is the most prominent and best 
characterized member of this family and an essential enzyme in al l eukaryotes. PDI was 
discovered by Anfinsen’s group in early 1960’s as  a component of micros omal extracts that 
assisted the refolding of RNAse A and lysozyme (Goldberger  et al. , 1963, 1964). PDI is 
composed of four thioredoxin-like domains (a- b-b′-a′), followed by the acidic c domain. 
There is an extensive internal sequence similarity between the a domain and the a′  domain as 
well as between the b domain and the b′ domain. The two redox activ e site sequences of PDI 
(C-G-H-C) are lo cated in the a  and a′  domains, and the active s ite cysteine residues are 
required for PDI activity (Laboissiere  et al. , 1995; Vuori  et al. , 1992). PDI is a 
multifunctional enzyme capable of catalyzing formation, reduction and isomerization of 
disulfide bonds in proteins in vitro . The oxidative activity of PDI is also established in vivo . 
For example, oxidative folding of the secret ory marker protein carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) 
depends on direct oxidation by PDI in yeast (Frand and Kaiser, 1999; Holst  et al. , 1997). The 
capture of mixed-disulfides be tween PDI and CPY indicates dir ect thiol-disulfide exchange 
between PDI and the substrate protein in the ER (Frand and Kaiser, 1999). Upon oxidation of 
thiols in substrate proteins, PDI becomes reduc ed and must be re-oxi dized. Since glutathione 
is the major redox buffer in the ER, and the ratio of reduced (GSH) to oxidized (GSSG) 
glutathione in the ER (between 1:1 and 3: 1) provides optimal conditions for oxidative 
refolding of proteins in vitro , it was believed that gl utathione was responsib le for re-oxidation 
of the PDI active sites. However, elimination of  glutathione from the yeast cell by removal of 
the enzyme involved in the first step of synthesis, γglutamylcysteine synthetase, did not 
prevent disulfide bond formation, but rendered the cells more prone to hyperoxidation, 
suggesting that glutathione functions as a net reductant in the ER (Cuozzo and Kaiser, 1999). 
Both genetic and biochemical approaches in yeast showed that the conserved membrane-
associated ER protein Ero1 is responsible for the oxidation of PDI (Chakravarthi and Bulleid, 
2004; Frand and Kaiser, 1998; Tu  et al. , 2000; Tu and Weissman, 2002). Defects in Ero1 lead 
to a lack of disulfide bond formation, whereas  overexpression of Ero1 accelerates the rate of Oxidative protein folding in eukaryotes versus E. coli  79 
oxidative protein folding and the acquisition of a native structure, demonstrating that Ero1 is 
an essential component of the oxidative fold ing machinery (Chakrav arthi and Bulleid, 2004; 
Frand and Kaiser, 1998; Pollard  et al. , 1998; Sevier and Kaiser, 2002). Ero1 is an FAD-
dependent enzyme that is able to oxidize PD I directly through disulf ide exchange and pass 
electrons to the terminal el ectron acceptor, molecular oxyge n (Frand and Kaiser, 1999; Tu  et 
al., 2000). Ero1 can catalyze oxidati on of PDI also under anaerobi c conditions, indicating that 
alternative electron acceptors could be used in the absence of oxygen (Sevier  et al. , 2001). It 
has been shown that PDI / Ero1-catalyzed disulfide bond formation proceeds independent of glutathione both in vivo  and in vitro  (Cuozzo and Kaiser, 1999; Tu  et al. , 2000). Thus Ero1 
and PDI constitute an oxidative pathway (Fi g. 13), analogous to the DsbA/B pathway in E. 
coli, that independently of  the bulk redox environment catalyzes  rapid disulfide formation in 
eukaryotes. An important implication of this finding is that the flow of oxidizing equivalents 
in the ER is controlled by the kinetics of the di sulfide exchange between proteins rather than 
by equilibration of protein thiols and disulfides with  glutathione redox buffer.  2 e-

Figure 13. Schematic model of oxid ative protein folding in the ER . The formation of disulfide bonds in 
the ER is catalyzed by PDI and Ero1. Disulfide isomerization may be performed by PDI or some of its 
homologues that are possibly kept in the active reduced state by GSH or by a not yet identified redox 
catalyst. (Tu and Weissman, 2004) 
The formation of native disulfide bonds not only involves oxidative  pairing of free 
thiols, but also isomerization of wrongly formed disulfides in proteins with multiple disulfide 
bonds. Eukaryotic secretory proteins typically  contain more disulfide bonds than their 
prokaryotic counterparts, indicat ing that there is an even greater need for disulfide bond 
isomerization function in the ER than in the periplasm. Alt hough many proteins are able to 80  Oxidative protein folding in eukaryotes versus E. coli  
fold spontaneously in a glutathione buffer in th e absence of oxidoreductases, the folding rate 
is dramatically increased in the presence of PDI (Weissman and Kim, 1993). In addition to a 
kinetic advantage, the catalyzed reduction or isomerization of disulfide bonds in proteins has 
the advantage that the enzymes favour the form ation of native over non-na tive disulfides. The 
most obvious candidate for the role of the disulf ide isomerase in the ER is PDI that is by far 
the most active disulfide isomerase in vitro . An attractive model is th at PDI catalyzes all types 
of reactions important for oxidative protein folding in vivo , namely disulfide bond formation, 
reduction and isomerization. Combination of th e oxidase, the reductase and the isomerase 
activities requires that redox active sites of PDI would eith er alternatively exist in the 
oxidized or reduced state, or that one of them  would be kept in the oxidized state and the 
other in the reduced state in vivo . Recently, Tai and Rapoport (2005) showed that Ero1 
oxidizes only the a′ domain (Tsai and Rapoport, 2002). Moreover, Ero1 seems to be more 
efficient in oxidizing substrat e-associated PDI compared to  free PDI (Tsai and Rapoport, 
2002). This would prevent futile redox cycles of PD I in the absence of substrate, in which free 
oxidized PDI would be reduced by GSH. Since the a domain is not a substrate of Ero1, it 
could be kept in reduced state for example by the glutathione redox buffer and function as an 
isomerase or a reductase. This assumption is c onsistent with the obse rvation that PDI is 
partially reduced in th e ER of yeast (Xiao  et al. , 2004).  
Another possibility is that i ndividual members of the PDI fa mily might be dedicated to 
the catalysis of disulfide bond form ation, reduction or isomerization in vivo , just as DsbA and 
DsbC work in separate pathways to catalyz e disulfide bond formation and isomerization in 
the bacterial periplasm. In this context, it is not surprising that there are four PDI homologues 
in the ER of yeast and dozens more are f ound in higher eukaryotes . Several of these 
oxidoreductases exist in a predom inantly reduced form in the cell and therefore could act as 
substrate-specific reductases or isomerases (Mezghrani et al. , 2001; Tu and Weissman, 2004). 
In yeast, one or more of the PDI homologues app eared to contribute to  the maturation of CPY 
that requires disulfide bond isomerization in vitro  (Xiao  et al. , 2004).   
Since disulfide bond isomerization can be  catalyzed by oxidoreductases only in 
reduced state, there must be a reductive path way in the ER. The exis ting data indicate that 
glutathione plays a role in the formation of native di sulfide bonds in the ER (Chakravarthi and 
Bulleid, 2004; Jessop  et al. , 2004).   Chacravarthi and Bullei d (2004) showed that a normal 
level of intracellular glutathione  is required to prevent the fo rmation of non-native disulfide 
bonds during the post-translatio nal folding in the ER of human tissue type plasminogen 
activator that contains 17 disulfide bonds. The detection of  a mixed disulfide between Oxidative protein folding in eukaryotes versus E. coli  81 
glutathione and Erp57, an analogue of PDI, led to the conclusion that GSH can reduce the ER 
oxidoreductases directly (Jessop  et al. , 2004). However, these data do not prove that the direct 
reduction of the ER oxidoreductases by glutathi one is the only existing or main reductive 
pathway in the ER. It could we ll be that glutathione contributes to the overall redox 
equilibrium in the eukaryotic cell, rather than directly participating in the disulfide reduction 
in the ER proteins. In this case, the reduc ing equivalents required for the disulfide bond 
isomerization in the ER could come through a separate enzyme-catal yzed pathway, analogous 
to the reductive DsbC/DsbD pathway in E. coli . In this model, glut athione (or another low 
molecular weight reductant) coul d serve as a source of reducing power in the eukaryotic cell 
that would be transferred by a redox catalys t to the ER oxidoreductases (Fig. 13).  
Dependence of the formation of native disulfides in proteins bot h in prokaryotes and 
eukaryotes on oxidative and redu ctive reactions, and therefor e requirement of catalytic 
pathways for maintaining the appropriate red ox state of the oxidoreductases, raises the 
question of how the two seemingly opposing pathways can coexist within the same intracellular compartment. Appling the principl es discovered in prokaryotes, the segregation 
of the oxidative and the reductive pathways co uld be explained by ki netic barriers between 
the two pathways. Indeed, fast and specific oxi dation of PDI by Ero1 well explains effective 
disulfide bond formation in the ER in the presen ce of GSH. On the othe r hand, the inability of 
Ero1 to oxidize the a domain and so me of PDI homologues (Mezghrani  et al. , 2001; Tu and 
Weissman, 2004) can cause their accumulation in th e reduced state such that they function as 
disulfide isomerases or reductases in the pres ence of glutathione redox buffer. However, the 
reduction of these enzymes by glutathione may be not rapid enough to support protein folding 
in the cell, and not yet identified redox catalyst( s), analogous to DsbD, could be required. In 
this context, complete kinetic analysis of th e possible disulfide exchange reactions between 
the ER components involved in native disu lfide bond formation would provide important 
information about the intracellular role of glut athione and the mechanis m of oxidative protein 
folding in eukaryotes.

 84  Outlook  
5. Outlook 
The most intriguing and difficult question about the catalytic mechanism of DsbD is electron 
transfer across the inner membrane. Despite th e intensive studies on DsbD during last 10 
years, its TM domain remains poorly characterized. For example, such a basic property as the 
redox potential is not yet determ ined. We do not know whether DsbD needs a co-factor for its 
function, and if not, how could a single pair of  cysteine residues be sufficient for electron 
transfer across ~60 Å membrane sp ace? It is also not clear, which cysteine in the TM domain 
mediates the disulfide exchange between the TM domain and cDsbD.  
One of the difficulties in the characterizing the disulfide exchange reaction between 
DsbD domains is the fact that the wild type dom ains of DsbD show no change in fluorescence 
upon reduction/oxidation. To solve this problem, we engineered a Trp-variant of cDsbD 
(cDsbD-Y457W), which doubles its fluorescen ce signal upon reduction. This amino acid 
replacement does not affect stab ility, redox poten tial and reactivity  of the protein. Based on 
the Y457W mutation, spectroscopi cally active DsbD constructs can be designed. For 
example, a truncated DsbD variant lacki ng nDsbD and bearing the Y457W replacement 
would be a useful tool for investigation of the disulfide exchange between the TM domain 
and cDsbD. A fusion construct w ith nDsbD and cDsbD-Y457W linked via a flexible linker of 
different length can be used to estimate the rate of the intramolecular disulfide exchange 
between the periplasmic domains of DsbD and thei r effective concentratio ns in the context of 
full-length DsbD.

and thioredoxin to DsbC via DsbD is an important and necessary proof of the proposed 
mechanism. However, the reconstitution could not be achieved simply  by mixing the purified 
components in solution, as there is comparably fast direct el ectron transfer from thioredoxin 
to nDsbD, cDsbD or DsbC (circumventing electron flow thr ough the TM domain). 
Incorporation of DsbD into liposom es thus seems to be a very at tractive approach. First of all, 
the membrane protein would be in the enviro nment close to the natural and could adopt 
proper conformation. Second, it would allow sepa ration of the cytosolic and periplasmic 
components of the pathway by the membrane  and therefore would exclude the above-
mentioned side reactions. Third, presence of the membrane gives a possibility to adjust the pH 
and ionic strength conditions correspondi ng to the cytosol and the periplasm. Outlook  85 
Finally, determination of the X-ray structur e of full-length DsbD is of high interest. 
The X-ray structure of the nDsbD-SS-cDsbD mixe d disulfide, which was determined in this 
work, could be used to solve the struct ure of DsbD through molecular replacement. 86  Curriculum vitae
