INTRODUCTION  
 Environmental pollution is one of the major 
hazard to the modern world. Due to a large heap in 
industrialization, lots of chemicals along with dyes 
synthesized chemically and used in day to day life  
(Moorthi  et al.,  2007) . More than 10,000  
commercial synthetic dyes of several classes have 
been produced worldwide with average annual 
production exceeding 2,80,000 tons (Jin et 
al.,2007) . They are widely used in textile, paper, 
food, cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries with 
the textile indus try being the largest consumer 
(Alalewi  and Jiang,  2012 ).Among all synthetic 
dyes, azo dyes are the largest group of dyes used in 
textile industry due to the ease and cost 
effectiveness of their synthesis (Saratale  et al.,  
2011) . Azo dyes are characterized  by presence of one or more azo groups – N = N – and are the most 
common synthetic dye s released into the 
environment . During dying process, about 10 -15% 
of dyes were lost in effluent (Zollinger  et al., 1987). 
The presence of dye in aquatic ecosystem decrea ses 
rate of photosynthesis by impeding light penetration 
into deeper areas. Furthermore, the dyes or their 
degraded by -products may be toxic to aquatic flora 
and fauna (Talarposthi  et al.,  2001) . In addition to 
their visual effects, many azo dyes are toxic  and in 
some cases they are carcinogenic to the humans as 
well as other animals (Saratale  et al.,  2009) .  
Many physical  treatmentslike ultrafiltration, reverse 
osmosis, ion exchange and absorption of dyes on 
various absorbents (activated carbon, peat, fly as h, 
and coal, wood chips, and corncob) (Choy et al.,  
1999)  and chemical methods like  oxidation  rections

photochemical oxidations and electrochemical 
treatments are available for the removal of dyes 
from textile effluent .Although widely applied, these 
meth ods are expensive and produces large amount 
of sludge which require safe disposal (Zille et al.,  
2009) . As an alternative, biological methods use 
different taxonomic groups of microbes such as 
bacteria, fungi, yeast and algae for the removal of 
azo dyes fr om the contaminated areas. Dye 
decolorization by fungi mainly involves adsorption 
rather than degradation and slow growth rate and 
low decolorization efficiency limits their use (Wang 
et al., 2009 ; Nigam et al., 1996 ). In contrast, bacteria 
can achieve a hig her degree of degradation and 
even complete mineralization of dyes under 
optimum circumstances (Asad  et al.,  2007 ; 
Gudmalwar and Kamble 2012;  Bhoosreddy, 2014; 
Prasad 2014; Maheshwari and Shivagami, 2016 ). 
Thus, the  present study was aimed to isolate 
and c haracterize indigenous bacteria l strain , capable 
of decolorizing Dark red 2B azo dye commonly 
used in textile industries of Surat, Gujarat, India. 
Additionally,  effect of various physico -chemical 
parameters on decolorization of the dye by isolated 
bacteria l strain s was studied.  
 
MATERIALS AND METHOD S 
Chemicals  
All the chemicals used in this study were of 
analytical grade and procured from Hi -media 
laboratories, Mumbai, India.  The azo dye Dark red 
2B used in this study was of industrial grade and 
purchased f rom local market of Surat, Gujarat, 
India.  
Sample Collection and Enrichment  
Samples were collected from chemically 
contaminated sites and enriched by inoculating 1 ml 
of sample in 100 ml sterile Bushnell Hass  (BH)  
medium  supplemented with 100 ppm of D ark r ed 
2B in 250 ml erlenmeyer flask. Flasks  were 
incubated at 30 °C at 100 rpm for 48 hr.  
Isolation and Screening of Dye decolorizing 
bacteria  
A loop full of enriched suspension was streaked on 
BH agar plates supplemented with 200 ppm dye and 
incubated at 30 °C for 24 hr. Bacterial isolates 
showing zone of dye decolorization were then 
subjected to secondary screening. Screened isolates 
were inoculated in 100 ml BH medium 
supplemented with 200 ppm of dye. The flasks were 
incubated at 30°C at 100 rpm.  
Selected b acterial isolates were streaked on nutrient 
agar and sent to Advanced Diagnostic Laboratory, Param doctor house, Lal Darvaja, Near Surat 
Railway Station, Surat, Gujarat for biochemical 
characterization. Biochemical tests were carried out 
on Phoenix Instrum ent, version: 6.01 A and Epi  
Center, version: V6.20A.  
Measurement of percentage of Dye 
decolorization ( Zimmermann et al., 1982)  
The samples were collected and centrifuged at 
10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. Decolorization 
efficiency was analyzed by measuring th e 
absorbance of culture supernatant at  530 nm  using  
UV-VIS Spectrophotometer (Shimadzu -UV-3600 
Plus) . The decolorizing efficiency was expressed as 
percentage of decolorization:  
Percentage of decolorization = [(Initial absorbance 
– Final Absorbance)/Initia l absorbance] * 100.  
Dye decolorization experiment  
Selected bacterial isolates were inoculated in 100 
ml BH medium supplemented with 200 ppm of 
Dark red 2B. The flasks were incubated at 30°C on 
rotary shaker at 100 rpm  for 5 days. Samples were 
removed asep tically and dye decolorization was 
measured by the method described earlier.  
Optimization of process parameters  
Effect of pH and incubation temperature on dye 
decolorization  
For pH optimization , initial pH of BH medium 
(with 200 ppm of dye) was adjusted t o 5, 6, 7, 8 and 
9 and decolorization assay was carried out . 1.5 ml 
of bacterial suspension was inoculated and 
incubated at 30°C at 1 00 rpm . The optimal 
temperature for dye decolorization differs greatly 
from one bacterium to another. 1.5 ml of bacterial 
suspension was inoculated  in BH medium (with 200 
ppm of dye)  and incubated at various temperatures 
like 30°C, 37°C, 40°C and 50°C at 100 rpm. 
Samples were removed and checked for dye 
decolorization.  
Effect of carbon  and nitrogen  supplementation 
on dye decol orization  
Effect of additional carbon supplementation 
(glucose and sucrose)  and nitrogen supplementation 
(ammonium chloride and urea) was tested for dye 
decolorization at various concentrations  i.e. 0.2%, 
0.5% and 1% (w/v). For this, 100 ml of BH medium 
(with 200 ppm of  dye) were supplemented with 
different carbon and nitrogen sou rces in different 
concentration . 1.5 ml of bacterial suspension was 
inoculated and flasks were incubated at 37°C at 100 
rpm. Samples were removed and checked for dye 
decolorization .  
Phytotoxicity Studies (Phugare  et al.,  2011)  
Phytotoxicity was performed in order to assess the

toxicity of the untreated and treated dye to commo  
agricultural crops. The dye decolorization product 
was extracted with equal amount of ethyl acetate 
and re covered by evaporation of  ethyl acetate phase 
and the components were dissolved in distilled 
water. Ten seeds of Phaseolus mungo  (mung) plants 
were sowed into a plastic petri dish with daily 
watering of (5 ml) of 300 ppm dye solution 
(positive control) and  extracted products (test 
sample). Negative control set was carried out using 
distilled water (daily 5 -ml watering) at the same 
time. Germination and length of shoot and r oot 
were recorded after 7 days.  
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
Sample collection and Enric hment  
Six different effluent and soil sediment samples 
were collected from three different contaminated 
sites namely Sachin GIDC  (21°05'30.1"N 
72°50'30.8"E) , Pandesara  Khadi (21°0 9'15.5"N 
72°49'01.2"E), and Bamroli  Khadi  (21°0 7'56.6"N 72°48'43.3"E). Enrich ment was done to promote the 
growth of bacterial populations in the samples.  
Isolation and Screening of Dye decolorizing 
bacteria  
13 different bacterial isolates showing zone of 
decoloriz ation were isolated and were subjected to 
secondary screening . In  secondary screening, 
selected isolated were inoculated in BH medium 
containing 200 ppm dye.  After secondary screening, 
two bacterial isolates namely JT1 and JT2 were 
selected on the basis of maximum dye 
decolorization of 98.83% and 98.72%, respectively. 
On th e basis of cul tural and biochemical 
characteristics , selected isolates were identified as 
Klebsiella spp.  for JT1 and Staphylococcus spp.  for 
isolate JT2 (Data not shown).  
Dye decolorization experiment  
The results of dye decolorization in liquid medium 
showed that m aximum dye decolorization up to 
93.02 % was obtained for JT1 isolate  as showed in 
the figure 1. 
 
 
Fig. 1: Decolorization of direct red 2B by isolate JT1 and JT2.  
 
Optimization of process parameters  
Maximum dye decolorization of 75.62 % was 
obtain ed with isolate JT2 at pH 7  as shown in 
figure2 .Similar results obtained by Chang et al.,  
(2000)  who found that the decolorization was 
increased to 2.5 fold as the pH raised from 5 to 7.  
For temperature optimization flasks were incubated 
at different tempe rature. Maximum dye 
decolorization of 87.35% was obtained with isolate 
JT1 at 37 °C of incubatio n temperature (Figure 3). 
Our results were supported by Moosvi  et al ., 
(2007) . They found that bacterial consortium JW -2 
showed maximum 93% decolorization of Rea ctive 
Violet 5R at 37°C. They also reported that further 
increase or decrease in temperature from optimum, 
decreases the decolorization rate.  The results of carbon supplementation study 
showed that  maximum dye decolorization of 
84.60% was obtained with bacterial isolate JT1 at 
1% glucose  (Figure  4). W hereas sucrose was 
observed as poor carbon source showing  only 
65.38% of  dye decolorization. Several reports are 
available for dye decolorization in presence of 
additional carbon source. Wang  et al., (2009 ) found  
90% of dye decolorization in presence of glucose as 
additional carbon source for decolorization of 
Reactive Red 180  dye by  Citrobacter sp.  CK3. 
Carbon source provides energy for the growth and 
survival of microbes and act as electron donor 
which is important for the breakage of azo bond 
(Gonzalez  et al.,  2009) . The decolorization 
efficiency of isolates in presence of A mmonium 
chloride and urea as nitrogen sources was studied.

Phytotoxicity  
Untreated or partially treated effluent may be 
disposed of in the water bodies and this water can 
be used for irrigation purpose. Thus it was found 
necessary to study phytotoxicity of the dye before 
and after degra dation. Phytochemical  studies 
showed that s hoot and root length s were affected in 
the presence of pure dye but it was less affected when tested with 300 ppm of extracted dye 
metabolites (Table 1.). This indicates the 
detoxification of dark red 2B dye with i solate JT1.  
Extracted metabolites from dye decolorization broth 
of JT2 isolate did not showed any promising results 
for detoxification of dark red 2B thus are not shown 
here.

Gudmalwar  and Kamble  (2012) also found that 
there was no germination inhibition in Vinga 
radiata  and Sorghum vulgare  seeds when they were 
treated with the metabolites after complete 
decolorization of Reactive red 4E8Y5 dye by 
Providencia spp. and Bacillus spp.  Similar results 
were also obtained by Ebency et. al.,  2013.  
 CONCLUSION  
From this study it coul d be concluded, bacterial 
isolates were identified as Klebsiella spp.  and 
Staphylococcus spp.  form biochemical 
characterization and had potential of decolorizing 
textile dyes. Thus, they can be exploited for their 
potential of dye decolorization and can be  used for 
bioremediation treatment of the industrial ef fluent.
