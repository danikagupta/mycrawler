Abstract The study of mycobacteriophages provides insights into viral diversity
and evolution, as well as the genetics and physiology of their patho-
genic hosts. Genomic characterization of 80 mycobacteriophages
reveals a high degree of genetic diversity and an especially richreservoir of interesting genes. These include a vast number of genes
of unknown function that do not match known database entries and
many genes whose functions can be predicted but which are nottypically found as components of phage genomes. Thus many mys-
teries surround these genomes, such as why the genes are there,what
do they do, how are they expressed and regulated, how do theyinfluence the physiology of the host bacterium, and what forces ofevolution directed them to their genomic homes? Although the
genetic diversity and novelty of these phages is full of intrigue, it is
a godsend for the mycobacterial geneticist, presenting an abundantlyrich toolbox that can be exploited to devise new and effective ways
for understanding the genetics and physiology of human tuberculosis.
As the number of sequenced genomes continues to grow, theirmysteries continue to thicken, and the time has come to learn more
about the secret lives of mycobacteriophages.
I. INTRODUCTION
Mycobacteriophages are viruses that infect mycobacterial hosts. Interest
in these viruses first arose in the late 1940s, and more than 300 publica-tions followed in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. Many of these studies180
Graham F. Hatfull
Author's personal copyfocused on descriptions of new mycobacteriophages and their character-
istics and utility in phage typing of clinical specimens. There was asignificant decline in the next two decades with fewer than 100 papers
published, followed by a resurgence in the early 1990s, and over 250
publications in the following two decades. This resurgence was fueledby the pioneering work of Dr. Jacobs and colleagues in using mycobacter-iophages to deliver foreign DNA into mycobacteria ( Jacobs, 2000 ;Jacobs
et al., 1987 ) and by the advent of the genomics era.
The utility of exploiting mycobacteriophages to understand their path-
ogenic hosts—such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium
leprae , the causative agents of human tuberculosis and leprosy, respec-
tively—is enhanced by complications in growth and manipulation of theirbacterial hosts ( Jacobs, 1992 ).M.tuberculosis can be propagated in the
laboratory with relative ease, except that it grows extremely slowly, witha doubling time of 24h, and virulent strains require biosafety level IIIcontainment. M.leprae cannot be grown readily under defined laboratory
conditions and no simple genetic tools are available ( Scollard et al., 2006 ).
Mycobacteriophages multiply relatively quickly (plaques appear on alawn of M.tuberculosis in 3–4days, whereas colonies take 3–4weeks to
grow) and can be grown easily to high titers ( Jacobs, 2000 ). However,
isolation of new mycobacteriophages on slow-growing strains such asM.tuberculosis is complicated because contamination becomes a serious
problem—everything else grows faster than M.tuberculosis . Ever since the
late 1940s it has been commonplace to use relatively fast-growing sapro-phytic nonpathogenic strains such as Mycobacterium smegmatis (doubling
time/C243 hours) to isolate and propagate mycobacteriophages ( Mizuguchi,
1984). Some of these phages also infect M. tuberculosis , although many do
not. However, these host preferences may be derived from host surfacedifferences rather than metabolic restrictions on gene expression, DNAreplication, packaging, or lysis ( Hatfull, 2010 ;Hatfull et al., 2010 ).
The application of more sophisticated molecular genetic approaches
has made mycobacteriophages important tools in mycobacterial geneticsand has been taken advantage of in numerous ways. However, thegenomic characterization of mycobacteriophages has also shown themto be enormously diverse, rendering them as fruitful subjects for addres-
sing broader questions in viral diversity and elucidating evolutionary
mechanisms ( Hatfull, 2010 ). These dual approaches - exploration and
exploitation - work well together such that key questions about mycobac-teriophage biology and how they can be utilized are expanding fasterthan answers can be obtained. Mycobacteriophage genomics hint at a vastarray of genetic and molecular secrets that await discovery, and it wouldseem that mycobacteriophage investigations have a very promisingfuture—that the best is still to come.Mycobacteriophages 181
Author's personal copyFinally, the enormous diversity of mycobacteriophages lends them for
use in an integrated research–education platform in viral discovery and
genomics ( Hanauer et al., 2006 ;Hatfull et al., 2006 ). The Science Education
Alliance program of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute has facilitatedimplementation of mycobacteriophage discovery for freshman undergrad-uate students in 44 institutions in the United States since 2008, with morethan 800 students engaged, hundreds of new mycobacteriophages isolated,and many dozens of genomes sequenced and analyzed ( Caruso et al., 2009 ;
Pope et al., 2011 ). This platform could be readily extended to the use of
alternative bacterial hosts with the potential to have a substantial impact onthe broader field of bacteriophage diversity, relieving the major limitations
in the area, which are no longer in DNA sequence acquisition technologies
but in obtaining individual isolates for further characterization.
This chapter discusses the current state of mycobacteriophage geno-
mics, our current understanding of mycobacteriophage molecular biol-ogy, and the variety of ways in which mycobacteriophages have beenexploited for both genetic and clinical applications. A number of otherreviews on various aspects of mycobacteriophages may be useful to thereader ( Hatfull, 1994, 1999, 2000, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010 ;Hatfull et al., 1994,
2008;Hatfull and Jacobs, 1994, 2000 ;McNerney, 1999 ;McNerney and
Traore, 2005 ;Stella et al., 2009 ).
II. THE MYCOBACTERIOPHAGE GENOMIC LANDSCAPE
A. Overview of 80 sequenced mycobacteriophage genomes
Consideration of mycobacteriophage diversity as revealed by their geno-
mic characterization is a suitable starting point for this review, and agenome-based taxonomy—albeit one that is intentionally barely hierar-chical—imposes a degree of order that is useful in discussing their biol-ogy. Currently, a total of 80 different phage genome sequences have been
described and compared ( Pope et al., 2011 ), and as of the time of writing
(January 2011) another 80 unpublished sequenced genomes are available
(http:/ /www.phagesdb.org ). The discussion here is restricted primarily
to the 80 published genomes listed in Table I . Mycobacteriophage gen-
omes vary in length from 42 to 164 kbp with an average of 69.2 kbp(Table I ). Genome sizes are distributed across this spectrum, although
with a notable absence of phages with genomes between 110 and 150 kbp.All of the virions contain linear double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)
molecules, but two different types of genome termini are observed.
Approximately 60% of the phage genomes have defined ends with shortsingle-stranded DNA (ssDNA) termini (4–14 bases), all of which have 3
0
extensions. The other 40% are terminally redundant and circularly182 Graham F. Hatfull

mined for any of these phages ( Table I ). Although the average GC%
content is similar to their common host M.smegmatis , there is substantial
variation in GC% content, ranging from 56 to 69%. The implications of thisare discussed further later (see Section II.D ).
B. Grouping of mycobacteriophages into clusters and
subclusters
Nucleotide sequence comparisons using dot plots clearly show that somemycobacteriophages are more closely related than others ( Fig. 1 ).
Although a seemingly crude approach, grouping phages according tothis relatedness offers a useful and pragmatic approach that recognizesthis basic level of diversity. Seventy-seven of the 80 sequenced phages canbe placed in a total of 12 different clusters (A–L) with the remaining 3considered as singletons, of which no closely related phages have yet been
identified ( Table I ). Two of the 80 phages, Omega and LeBron, have been
assigned to clusters (J and L, respectively) because they have close rela-
tives among the sequenced but yet to be published mycobacteriophagegenomes. In the case of Cluster J there are two phages in addition toOmega that form this cluster, whereas for Cluster L there are six addi-tional phages related to LeBron. The detailed discussions that follow areconstrained to just those 80 published genomes shown in Table I .
Cluster assignment is performed primarily according to recognizable
nucleotide sequence similarity that spans more than 50% of the genomelength with one or more other genomes ( Fig. 1 )(Hatfull, 2010 ). The
advantage of using dot plot analyses for this is that it provides a methodfor resolving two of the most difficult scenarios that emerge: (1) when twogenomes appear to have diverged substantially such that they share DNAsequence similarity over a substantial portion of their genomes, but thedegree of similarity is relatively low, and (2) when two genomes sharesegments of DNA sequence similarity that are very similar to each other,
but extend only over a relatively small portion of the genomes (i.e.,
<50%). In practice, relatively few such scenarios arise, and in most cases
cluster assignment is straightforward. Dot plot analyses and averagenucleotide identity (ANI) parameters suggest that some clusters can befurther divided into subdivisions referred to as subclusters ( Fig. 1 )
(Hatfull, 2010 ). Phages of different subclusters within the same cluster
often share similar genome organizations and many genes are clearlyorthologues as revealed by amino acid sequence comparisons of their
products, but with relatively low degrees of nucleotide similarity ( Fig. 1 ,
Table I ; see also Fig. 3 B).
A hallmark of all or most phage genomic architectures is that they are
mosaic, built from segments that have distinct evolutionary histories andMycobacteriophages 187
Author's personal copythat have been exchanged horizontally over an extended period of time;
this is certainly true of mycobacteriophages ( Hendrix, 2002 ;Hendrix et al.,
1999, 2000 ;Pedulla et al., 2003 ). This makes any form of hierarchical
classification of whole genomes difficult, and reticulate systems providefuller and likely more accurate portrayals of their evolution ( Lawrence
et al., 2002 ;Lima-Mendez et al., 2008 ). Organization into clusters and
subclusters should not be interpreted as representing any well-definedboundaries between different types of viruses, but rather a reflection ofincomplete sampling of a large and diverse population of viruses occupy-ing positions on a broad spectrum of multidimensional relationships.

FASTA-formatted file was generated containing the nucleotide sequences of all 80

the top and on the left.188 Graham F. Hatfull
Author's personal copyAs such, cluster and subcluster structures are not likely to be stable, and
as more mycobacteriophages are discovered and sequenced, clusters areexpected to undergo further subdivision, and differences between mem-
bers of particular clusters could become reduced to that seen between
subclusters. Clusters thus do not represent lineages per se, but do providea convenient means of representing the heterogeneity of the currentlysequenced phages. For example, differences between genomes withinsubclusters are likely to represent relatively recent evolutionary events,and a good example is the discovery of the novel MPME transposonsfrom comparison of Cluster G phage genomes ( Pope et al., 2011 ;Sampson
et al., 2009 ).
C. Relationships between viral morphologies and cluster types
All mycobacteriophages discovered to date are tailed phages and containdsDNA genomes (i.e., of the order Caudovirales). However, only two ofthe three major families of the Caudovirales are represented, and noPodoviridae—with short stubby tails—have been reported. Seventy-oneof the mycobacteriophages are Siphoviridae with long flexible noncon-tractile tails and 9 are Myoviridae with contractile tails. All Myoviridaeare in Cluster C, containing capsids approximately 80 nm in diameter and
genomes 153.7 to 164.6 kbp long. Most Siphoviridae contain isometric
heads—ranging from 48 to 75 nm in diameter—but several contain pro-late heads, including all three members of Cluster I and the singletonCorndog ( Table I )(Hatfull et al., 2010 ;Pope et al., 2011 ). Tail lengths of
Siphoviridae vary by nearly threefold, from 110 nm to 300 ( Hatfull et al.,
2010).
D. Relationships between GC% and cluster types
Different clusters—and in some cases subclusters—have distinctive GC%contents ( Fig. 2 ). For example, all Cluster A genomes range between
62.3% GC% (L5) and 64.5% GC% (RedRock) ( Table I ), and the only
other genomes that lie within this range are those in cluster E ( Fig. 2 ).
Cluster D phages are all 59.6–59.7% GC% and no other phages lie withinthis range. In Cluster B, the four subclusters differ somewhat in GC% withlittle overlap between their ranges of values, and Subclusters B1 and B4contain genomes with the highest GC% content of any of the mycobacter-iophages. At the other extreme, Cluster H and the singleton Wildcat havethe lowest GC% content (56.3–57.3%). The reason why GC% should vary
by cluster is not known, but an intriguing idea is that the different clusters
(and perhaps in some cases subclusters) have distinct host ranges, not-withstanding that they are all capable of infecting M. smegmatis , a require-
ment of their isolation procedure; codon usage analyses are consistentMycobacteriophages 189
Author's personal copywith this ( Hassan et al., 2009 ). As such, distinctions between clusters may
arise from partial genetic isolation, with either host range or host avail-
ability imposing constraints on the exchange of genetic informationbetween the genomes over a short—but evolutionary significant—timeframe. Limited host range data are available for some of the phages(Rybniker et al., 2006 ), but detailed host preferences for the larger collec-
tion of phages have yet to be determined.
E. Mycobacteriophage phamilies
Although nucleotide sequence comparisons are useful for clusteringclosely related phages, identification of homologues that diverged longerago can usually only be identified by comparison of the predicted amino
acid sequences. The computer program Phamerator performs automated
assembly of genes into phamilies (phams) based on pairwise comparisonsusing both Clustal and BlastP searches using current threshold levels of32.5% amino acid sequence identity and 10
-50E values, respectively

FIGURE 2 Relationships between genome GC% and cluster/ subcluster types. The
average GC% is shown for each cluster or subcluster of the mycobacteriophages, with
variants showing extreme values within each group.190 Graham F. Hatfull
Author's personal copy(Cresawn et al., manuscript in preparation; Hatfull et al., 2006 ;Pope et al.,
2011). The 80 published genomes encode a total of 9015 predicted genes,
which assemble into 2343 phams of which 1106 (47.2%) are orphams
(phams containing only a single gene member)( Pope et al., 2011 ). Pha-
merator enables two helpful types of representation of these data. The
first is the display of genome maps illustrating both regions of DNAsimilarity and representing individual genes according to the phamilyto which they belong. The second is the use of phamily circles to displaywhich of the component genomes contain members of any particularphamily. Phamily circles are especially useful for examining the phylo-genies of adjacent genes in a genome and identifying where recombina-
tion events have adjoined genes or gene segments, each of which have
distinct evolutionary histories ( Hatfull et al., 2006 ).
Database searches show that about 80% of mycobacteriophages pha-
milies have no identifiable homologues outside of mycobacteriophages;this high proportion of novel sequences reflects a common finding inphage genomics ( Abedon, 2009 ;Casas and Rohwer, 2007 ;Comeau et al.,
2008;Hatfull, 2010 ;Hatfull et al., 2006, 2010 ;Krisch and Comeau, 2008 ).
As a consequence, functions of the vast majority of mycobacteriophage
gene functions remain unknown. Exceptions are the approximately 10%
of phamilies that are homologues of proteins with known functionsand those that constitute operons of virion structural and assemblygenes, that at least in phages with a siphoviral morphology have a well-conserved synteny ( Hatfull et al., 2010 ;Pope et al., 2011 ).
F. Genome organizations
Mycobacteriophage genome organizations are well conserved amongphages within clusters, and there are therefore 15 types to be considered,clusters A through L, and three singleton genomes. With the exception ofCluster C genomes, all have siphoviral morphologies and contain a predicted
long operon of the virion structure and assembly genes, which are typically
represented in the left parts of the genomes and transcribed rightward
(Hatfull, 2010 ). In the smallest genomes (Cluster G), there are about 25
genes in this operon spanning 24 kbp, or 57% of the total genome length.In contrast, in the Cluster J phage Omega, there are 48 genes in this pre-sumed late operon, although likely only approximately half of these haveroles in virion structure and assembly genes, and the functions of most ofthe others are unknown (see Section III.J ). However, they include a putative
glycosyl transferase (gp16), a putative O-methyl transferase (gp17), a puta-
tive kinase (gp2), and a putative enoyl-CoA hydratase (gp4). It is not knownif these are required for phage propagation or what their specific roles are.
The genomes of Clusters A, E, F, G, I, J, K, L, and all three singletons
have defined ends with short (4–14 base) 3
0ssDNA extensions ( Table I ).Mycobacteriophages 191
Author's personal copyPhages in Cluster B, C, D, and H have genomes lacking defined ends, and
genome sequencing data suggest that these all have circularly permuted,terminally redundant ends. In Clusters F, G, I, and K genomes, genes
encoding large terminase subunits and, in some cases, genes encoding
small terminase subunits can be identified close to the physical left end ofthe genomes, their presumed sites of action in DNA packaging. However,in other genomes, these terminase genes are displaced from the physicalgenome ends, with additional genes (mostly of unknown function) in theintervening space. The largest distance is in Corndog, where the largeterminase subunit gene ( 32) is over 13 kbp from the left end.
Genes encoding integrases can be identified in most genomes of Clus-
ters A, E, F, G, I, J, K, L, and singleton Giles, and are located near the centerof their genomes, regardless of a span of a nearly threefold difference ingenome size ( Hatfull, 2006 ). The furthest from the midpoint is in the
Cluster I phage, Brujita (39% of genome length from the left end). Putativelysis genes can be identified in all of the siphoviral mycobacteriophagegenomes, although they may be located either to the left of terminasegenes (as in Cluster A) or to the right of the virion structure and assemblygenes ( Hatfull, 2010 ). In Cluster C genomes, linkage of the virion structure
and assembly genes is much less obvious, and the identities of relativelyfew have been determined. Further details of each of the genome typesare discussed.
III. PHAGES OF INDIVIDUAL CLUSTERS, SUBCLUSTERS,
AND SINGLETONS
A. Cluster A
Cluster A is one of the largest clusters of mycobacteriophages, containing17 of the 80 (21%) sequenced genomes. It is also highly diverse andcurrently contains four subclusters (A1–A4), although many of the
unpublished genomes also belong to this cluster and are expected to
expand the number of subclusters to at least six. Subclusters A1 and A2predominate, with nine current members of A1 and five of A2 ( Table I ).
There is no obvious geographical preference for the Cluster A phageshaving been isolated from two countries outside the United States andfrom 11 states within the United States ( Table I )(Pope et al., 2011 ). Cluster
A genome lengths lie within a relatively narrow range (49,136–53,572 bp)and also occupy a narrow range of GC% (62.3–64.5%), slightly lower than
that of their M.smegmatis host (67.4%)( Table I ). Subclusters A2 and A3
phages all contain at least one tRNA gene, whereas Subclusters A1 and A4
do not. At least four of the Subcluster A2 phages infect M. tuberculosis
efficiently [L5, D29, Che12, and Pukovnik ( Fullner and Hatfull, 1997 ;192
Graham F. Hatfull
Author's personal copyGomathi et al., 2007 ;Hatfull et al., 2010 ;Kumar et al., 2008 )] but none of the
phages in Subclusters A1 or A3 do so. It is not yet known if either of the
Subcluster A4 phages infect M.tuberculosis or do so efficiently.
All Cluster A phages are either temperate or recent derivatives of
temperate parents. Perhaps the best-studied member of the cluster is L5(Subcluster A2), which was isolated in Japan in 1960 ( Doke, 1960 ) and was
the first sequenced mycobacteriophage ( Hatfull and Sarkis, 1993 ). L5
forms evidently turbid plaques from which lysogens can be recoveredreadily and which are both immune to superinfection by L5 and releasephage particles into culture supernatants during liquid growth. Phage L1is a closely related temperate phage with the same restriction pattern as
L5, but is naturally temperature sensitive ( Doke, 1960 ;Leeet al., 1991 ); its
genome sequence has not yet been reported. Lysogens have also been
generated for phages Bxb1, DD5, Jasper, Skipole, Solon, RedRock, Eagle,Peaches, Pukovnik, and Che12 ( Kumar et al., 2008 ;Pope et al., 2011 ). D29,
which was isolated more than 50years ago ( Froman et al., 1954 ), forms
clear plaques and kills a high proportion of infected cells. Genomiccharacterization suggests that it has lost a segment of approximately3 kbp from the right end corresponding to the position of the repressor
gene of L5, and D29 remains subject to L5 superinfection immunity ( Ford
et al., 1998a ). This deletion event could have occurred relatively recently,
and it was noted previously that the current isolate of D29 is just one of
several plaque morphotypes in the original isolate ( Bowman, 1958 ;
Hatfull, 2010 ). Bethlehem, KBG, Lockley, and Bxz2 also form clear pla-
ques and fail to form lysogens ( Pope et al., 2011 ), and we speculate that the
temperate nature of Cluster A phages tends to either be selected againstduring plaque isolation or be lost during subsequent laboratory propaga-
tion. Cluster A phages fall into three major immunity groups, which
correspond closely to subclusters A1, A2, and A4 (see Section V.A.1 ).
Lysogens of any of the temperate Subcluster A1 phages confer superin-fection immunity to other A1 phages (i.e., they are homoimmune) but notto phages of other A subclusters. Similarly, phages within each of Sub-clusters A2 and A4 are homoimmune but heteroimmune with otherCluster A phages ( Pope et al., 2011 ). Bxz2 is currently the sole member
of Subcluster A3 and does not form lysogens. However, the genome
contains a putatively defective repressor gene, and because it is not
subject to immunity by any of the other Cluster A phages, it likelycorresponds to a derivative of a fourth distinct immunity group ( Pope
et al., 2011 ). A map of the L5 genome, as a representative of Cluster A
phages, is shown in Figure 3 A. There are several notable features. First,
the virion structure and assembly genes—several of which were identi-fied through N-terminal sequencing of virion proteins ( Hatfull and
Sarkis, 1993 )—are arranged in canonical order, encoding terminase,
portal, protease, scaffold, capsid, major tail subunit tail assemblyMycobacteriophages 193
Author's personal copyAuthor's personal copyFIGURE 3 Organizational feature of Cluster A genomes. (A) Map of the L5 genome. The L5 genome (a member of Subcluster A2) is represented
as a horizontal bar with markers, and the predicted ORFs are shown as colored boxes either above (rightward transcribed) or below (leftward
transcribed) the genome. Gene names are shown inside the boxes, and phams to which they belong are indicated above, with the total number
of pham members shown in parentheses. ORFs are color coded according to their pham memberships (i.e., all members of the same pham arethe same color) and those shown in white are orphans, phams that contain only a single gene member. tRNA genes are shown as short black
bars. Putative gene functions identified either experimentally or as predicted bioinformatically are shown above the genes; genes whose
products match a substantial number of conserved hypothetical proteins are designated Hyp (for conserved hypothetical). Bioinformatically
Author's personal copychaperones, tapemeasure, and minor tail proteins ( Fig. 3 A), although an
additional tail protein (gp6) is encoded between the terminase and the left
end of the genome ( Hatfull and Sarkis, 1993 ); no gene encoding a putative
small terminase subunit has been identified. The /C246.5-kbp region
between the large terminase and the left end contains three closely linkedtRNA genes, as well as the lysis system. Second, the integration system isencoded in the middle of the genome, and all genes to its left are tran-scribed rightward and all genes to its right are transcribed leftward; thegenome can therefore be split conveniently into left and right arms(Fig. 3 A). Third, L5 encodes its own DNA polymerase, a Pol I-like enzyme
that lacks the 5
0–30exonuclease domain ( Hatfull and Sarkis, 1993 ),
although it is not known if it required phage DNA replication. L5 does
designated functional assignments were determined using BLASTP against the nonre-
dundant protein database at GenBank and HHPRed ( Soding, 2005). The map was gener-
ated using the program Phamerator (S. Cresawn and Graham F. Hatfull, manuscript in
preparation). (B) Cassettes for genome stabilization encoding tyrosine-integrases, serine-
integrases, or ParA/B partitioning functions. The figure shows representations of thecentral parts of three Cluster A genomes: RedRock (Subcluster A2), Peaches (SubclusterA4), and Eagle (Subcluster A4). Each genome is represented as horizontal bars with
markers, and genes are represented as described (A). Maps were generated in Phamera-
tor, and nucleotide sequence similarity between adjacent genomes is shown betweenthem; the strength of similarity is shown according to the color spectrum, with red being
the weakest and violet the strongest. Thus Peaches and Eagle are very closely related at
the nucleotide level (justifying their grouping into the same subcluster, A4), except forthe/C242.6-kbp central segment. RedRock is more distantly related to Peaches (and
therefore to Eagle too) as shown by a sporadic, shorter, weaker segment of homology.Note that even in the absence of extensive nucleotide similarity the synteny of thisregion (other than in the central segment) is largely conserved, and the gene order in
RedRock is similar to that in Peaches and Eagle. This can be seen by gene/pham color
coding and by pham designations above the genes. Within the central region, Peaches andEagle are different, and Peaches encodes a serine-integrase and Eagle encodes a tyrosine-integrase (gp32). The segment in Eagle that differs between the two phages also encodes
the Xis protein [gp34; a member of a large highly diverse group of proteins acting as
recombination directionality factors, or RDFs ( Lewis and Hatfull, 2001 )] that controls the
directionality of integrase-mediated recombination. The central segment in Eagle con-
tains a serine-integrase gene ( 33), but does not contain a putative RDF gene that acts with
the integrase. However, the Peaches RDF is likely gp52, which is related to the known RDF
of the Bxb1 serine-integrase system ( Ghosh et al ., 2006). Related proteins are encoded in
all Cluster A members, even those with tyrosine-integrases such as Eagle (shown as RDFin parentheses in the figure) and likely perform additional functions in DNA replication.The Peaches serine-integrase could thus have been acquired from an Eagle-like ancestor,without concomitant RDF acquisition. In RedRock, the central segment has no integrase
gene, but instead has two genes ( 37and 38) encoding ParA and ParB functions, respec-
tively. The RedRock prophage presumably replicates extrachromosomally and is stably
maintained by these partitioning functions.196 Graham F. Hatfull
Author's personal copynot encode its own RNA polymerase and uses the host RNA polymerase
for all its transcription, being sensitive to the addition of rifampicin(Hatfull and Sarkis, 1993 ). Genes 48and 50are expressed early in lytic
growth and encode flavin-dependent thymidylate synthase (ThyX) andribonucleotide reductase functions, respectively, and the two proteinsform a complex during lytic growth ( Bhattacharya et al., 2008 ). Mutants
affecting two genes in L1 are implicated in the regulation of late geneexpression, although locations of the mutations relative to the genomemap are not known ( Datta et al., 2007 ).
There is considerable variation in the tRNA genes present in Cluster A
genomes. Subclusters A1 and A4 have none, the Subcluster A3 phage
Bxz2 has three (tRNA
asn,t R N Atrp, and tRNAleu), and Subcluster A2
phages differ between one and five ( Table I ). Of the five tRNA genes in
D29 (tRNAasn, tRNAtrp, tRNAgln,t R N Aglu, and tRNAtyr), the first three
are also present in L5, and the tRNAgluand tRNAtyrgenes could have
been lost by a simple deletion ( Ford et al., 1998a ;Hatfull and Sarkis, 1993 ).
Interestingly, Che12 has three similar tRNA genes, but the order of the
latter two is reversed. Pukovnik and RedRock each have a single tRNAgene (tRNA
glnand tRNAtrp, respectively), and although the RedRock
tRNAtrpis a close relative of that in L5, D29, and Bxz2, the tRNAglnis
not closely related to the tRNAglngenes in L5 and D29. It has been noted
that the frequencies of usage of the five amino acids corresponding to thetRNA specificities are high in D29 relative to M.tuberculosis , but that the
specific roles of their tRNAs are uncertain because they are not wellconserved among the related genomes ( Kunisawa, 2000 ).
A leftward promoter (P
left) located at the right end of the genome is
responsible for early expression of right arm genes and is directly under
repressor control ( Brown et al., 1997 ;Nesbit et al., 1995 ); a promoter for
expression of the virion structure and assembly genes has yet to be
identified. Three additional promoters are located upstream of the repres-sor, but it is unclear what specific roles these play ( Nesbit et al., 1995 ).
Because the attP site is located at the 5
0side of the integrase gene, a
promoter is presumably located between the attP crossover site and the
start of the intgene. A detailed description of transcription patterns and a
full constitution of promoter and terminator signals have yet to be eluci-
dated for L5 or any mycobacteriophage.
A particularly intriguing feature of L5 and the other Cluster A gen-
omes is that they contain multiple repressor binding sites—referred to as
stoperators—in addition to operator sites at P left(Brown et al., 1997 ) (see
Section V.A.1 ). In L5, there are a total of 24 sites corresponding to the 13-
bp asymmetric consensus sequence 50-GGTGGMTGTCAAG (where M is
A or C) to which the repressor binds; these are located predominantlywithin short intergenic regions and in one orientation relative to the
direction of transcription ( Brown et al., 1997 ). When one or more ofMycobacteriophages 197
Author's personal copythese sites is positioned between a promoter and a reporter gene, there is a
repressor-dependent reduction of reporter gene activity; activity isdependent on orientation of the site relative to the direction of transcrip-
tion and is amplified by multiple site insertions ( Brown et al., 1997 ). It is
proposed that the repressor mediates termination of transcription rather
than initiation and perhaps plays a role in ensuring transcriptional silenceof phage genes in a lysogen that might otherwise be deleterious to lyso-genic growth ( Brown et al., 1997 ). Several L5 genes have been implicated
in cytotoxicity ( Donnelly-Wu et al., 1993 ), with strong evidence for genes
64(Chattoraj et al., 2008 ),77,78, and 79(Rybniker et al., 2008 ). All other
Cluster A phages contain multiple stoperator sites with as many as 36
predicted in Jasper ( Pope et al., 2011 ). The consensus sequence is similar
within each of the subclusters, but differs from subcluster to subcluster,
consistent with these playing an important role—along with their cognaterepressors—in determining immunity specificities.
Although there is considerable sequence diversity in Cluster A gen-
omes, overall organizations are similar ( Hatfull et al., 2010 ). An interesting
point of departure though is the use of different types of integrationsystems. All of the genomes in Cluster A2 encode tyrosine-integrases,
whereas all A1 and A3 genomes encode serine-integrases. Interestingly,
although the two phages in Cluster A4, Eagle and Peaches, are otherwiseextremely similar to each other (97.5% average nucleotide identity), Eagleencodes a tyrosine-integrase and Peaches encodes a serine-integrase(Fig. 3 B). The segment of DNA differing between the two genomes
includes the tyrosine integrase, attP and the excise gene in Eagle, and
the serine-integrase gene in Peaches ( Pope et al., 2011 ). We note that this
genetic swap does not include the Peaches recombination directionality
factor (RDF), which is presumably encoded by gene 52, a close relative of
the known RDF of Bxb1 gp47 ( Ghosh et al., 2006 ), but which is more than 9
kbp away ( Fig. 3 B) (see Section V.B ). However, homologues of the Bxb1
RDF are present in all Cluster A genomes, regardless of whether they
utilize a tyrosine-integrase or a serine-integrase, and they presumablyperform additional functions, perhaps in DNA replication ( Fig. 3B).
Thus Peaches could conceivably have acquired the serine-integrase froman Eagle-like parent without the necessity to also acquire the RDF func-
tion ( Fig. 3 B). Curiously, RedRock encodes neither a tyrosine- nor a
serine-integrase, but in the middle of the genome (where the integrase is
located in related genomes) codes for ParA and ParB proteins, suggestingthat RedRock lysogens are maintained extrachromosomally and that theParAB system acts to provide maintenance of the prophage ( Fig. 3 B). This
raises the question as to how an extrachromosomal RedRock prophage isreplicated because its close relatives in Subcluster A2 clearly do integrateinto the host chromosome and replication functions are presumably
switched off. There are few clues from genome comparisons as to how198
Graham F. Hatfull
Author's personal copythese presumed differences in replication requirements are accomplished
and warrant a detailed experimental investigation. There are at least twoexamples of intein insertions in Cluster A phages evident from compara-
tive genomic analyses. One of these is the intein in the Cluster A1 phage
Bethlehem located within the terminase large subunit gene ( 10), which is
absent from all other Cluster A terminases. Related copies of this inteinare present in terminases of the Cluster L phage Omega (gp11) andCluster E phages Cjw1 and Kostya (gp8 and gp9, respectively) and in aphamily of genes of unknown function in Cluster C phages (e.g., ET08gp202); it is also commonly associated with most mycobacterial DnaB-likehelicases. Interestingly, the Bethlehem gp10 intein utilizes a novel mecha-
nism of protein splicing ( Tori et al. , 2009 ). The second type of intein is
present in Cluster A1 phages Bethlehem gp51, KBG gp53, and U2 gp50,
which are homologues of the RDF protein that controls the directionalityof Bxb1 serine-integrase-mediated site-specific recombination (see Section
V.B.2 )(Ghosh et al., 2006 ). Relatives of this intein are also present in
Cluster C phages Cali gp3, ET08 gp3, and LRRHood gp3 that encodeputative nucleotidyltranferases (see Section III.C ).
Cluster A virions are all siphoviral in their morphology and contain
isometric heads attached to long flexible tails. The lengths of their tailsare relatively short ( /C24115 nm) compared to other mycobacteriophages
(Hatfull et al., 2010 ), and a close correlation exists between tail length and
length of the gene encoding the tapemeasure protein ( Pedulla et al., 2003 ).
Between the major tail subunit gene ( 23) and the tapemeasure protein
gene (26) are two open reading frames ( 24and 25) that are functionally
analogous to the GandTgenes of phage Lambda ( Levin et al., 1993 ) and
are expressed via a /C01 programmed translational frameshift ( Xuet al.,
2004); these are thought to act as tail assembly chaperones. Interestingly,
although the capsid subunits are not closely related to the well-studiedphage HK97 capsid subunit, L5, D29, and Bxb1 (and presumably all otherCluster A phages) share the property of wholesale covalent cross-linkingof capsid subunits ( Ford et al., 1998a ;Hatfull and Sarkis, 1993 ;Mediavilla
et al., 2000 ;Popa et al., 1991 ).
Genome comparison of Cluster A phages shows that Bethlehem con-
tains a segment including genes 71and 72that is absent from other
Subcluster A1 phage genomes. The gene products are distantly relatedto genes found in Omega ( 21,22) postulated to be part of an IS110-like
transposon (see Section III.J ). Bethlehem therefore likely carries a distantly
related member of this poorly characterized transposon family.
B. Cluster B
Cluster B contains 15 phages whose genomes range from 67,118 to 70,654 bp.There are four subclusters, B1–B4, and there are a number of notabledifferences among them. Cluster B virions contain a linear genome withMycobacteriophages 199
Author's personal copyterminally redundant and circularly permuted ends ( Table I ). The left ends
of B1 genomes are arbitrarily designated as the first base of the putative
small terminase gene, but in Subclusters B2, B3, and B4, additional genes are
closely linked with intergenic spaces to the left of putative terminase large
subunit genes, and thus the left end of the genome is arbitrarily designatedat the first noncoding intergenic gap encountered to the left of the terminasegene. Cluster B genomes could use specific packaging sites near the termi-nase gene to initiate headful packaging, but none have been identified.Cluster B phages typically form plaques that are neither clear nor evidentlyturbid, but have a somewhat hazy appearance. However, stable lysogenshave not been reported for any Cluster B phage, and they behave as lytic
rather than temperate phages. The genomes provide few clues as to their life
styles, and none encode identifiable integrases, transposases, or partitioningfunctions. Also, none encode recognizable repressors, although these aregenerally diverse at the sequence level, and it is noteworthy that the L5repressor (gp71) has no close relatives outside of the mycobacteriophages;repressors can thus be overlooked easily. Like Cluster A phages, Cluster Bphages encode their own DNA polymerase—also a Pol I-like enzyme—aswell as a putative primase/helicase protein. The genome organization of the
Cluster B representative, Rosebush, is shown in Figure 4 . The virion struc-
ture and assembly genes are shown in the left part of the genome and
transcribed rightward; the long tapemeasure protein gene is a strikingfeature because of its length (5.6 kbp), reflecting the long tail (235 nm) inRosebush and other Cluster B virions ( Hatfull et al., 2010 ). However, there
are several notable features of this presumed operon. First, it is interruptedby a number of genes of unknown function, transcribed in both forward andreverse directions ( Fig. 4 ). The leftward-transcribed genes 8and 23both
have homologues outside of Cluster B, raising confidence in their annotationand identification. There are also four rightward-transcribed genes ( 9–12)
between the terminase ( 7) and portal ( 13) genes; gp8 is related to Holliday
Junction resolving RuvC-like proteins, but the others are of unknown func-tion. Second, there are five predicted rightward-transcribed genes betweenthe major tail subunit gene ( 21) and the tapemeasure protein gene ( 29;a n d
two transcribed leftward) instead of the more typical pair of genes as seen inL5 (Fig. 3 A). Moreover, the two genes in L5 ( 24and 25)e n c o d i n gt a i l
assembly chaperones are expressed via a programmed translational frame-shift, a highly conserved feature in virtually all dsDNA-tailed viruses,especially those with siphoviral morphotypes ( Xuet al., 2004 ). Cluster B
phages appear to be notable exceptions, and although one or more of genes24–28could perhaps act as tail assembly chaperones, there is no evidence
supporting expression via frameshifting. We note that none of these havemycobacteriophage-related proteins outside of Cluster B phages. Two of theCluster B3 phages, Pipefish and Phlyer, contain intein insertions in their
terminase large subunit genes (gp6).200

Author's personal copyThe extent of the Rosebush virion structure and assembly operon is
unclear, although closely linked open reading frames continue after the
tapemeasure protein gene through to gene 42(there is a small noncoding
gap between genes 36and 37), all or many of which are likely to encode
minor tail proteins ( Fig. 4 ). Genes to the right of gene 42are arranged in
five putative operons containing genes 43–45,46–47,48–60,61–68, and
69–90. The vast majority of these 46 genes are of unknown function,
although the 48–60operon includes genes encoding DNA replication
functions. Rosebush gene 46corresponds to lysin A, and it is plausible
that47encodes a holin required for the delivery of Lysin A to its peptido-
glycan substrate. Rosebush and its Subcluster B2 associate Qyrzula are
notable in that they are among the few mycobacteriophages that do not
encode a Lysin B protein ( Payne et al. , 2009 ); Subcluster B1, B3, and B4
phages all encode a Lysin B protein. Subcluster B2 phages (Rosebush andQyrzula) have an intriguing set of six genes ( 1–6) located between the
terminase gene ( 7) and the arbitrarily designated genome left end ( Figs. 4
and 5 ). Genes 3–6are predicted to encode QueC, QueD, QueE, and QueF
proteins, respectively, strongly implicating them in the biosynthesis ofqueuosine from GTP; HHPred analysis ( Soding, 2005 ) predicts that gp2 is
a queuine-tRNA-ribosyltransferase ( Fig. 5 ). Queuosine is a modified base
found commonly in bacterial tRNAs in the first anticodon position,although known queuosine biosynthetic genes are absent from mycobac-terial genomes and the presence of queuosine as a tRNA modification hasnot been reported. Neither Rosebush nor any other Cluster B phageencodes its own tRNAs, and we therefore predict that in Rosebush (andQyrzula) infections, that host tRNAs are modified with Queuosine;whether this alters the specificity of the translational apparatus or simply
enhances the efficiency of translation is not known. Rosebush gene 1is
predicted to encode a transcription regulator but HHPred predicts rela-
tionships to ParB, KorB, and SopB proteins involved in chromosomepartitioning; the proximity to the Queuosine biosynthetic operon suggeststhat gp1 could be involved in regulating this process.
The architectures of Subcluster B1, B3, and B4 genomes are similar to
those of Rosebush and Qyrzula (Subcluster B2), including the long puta-tive operon containing the virion structure and assembly genes and the
five predicted operons to its right. There is an interesting difference
within the structural gene organization in that—like Subcluster B2—Sub-clusters B1, B2, and B4 also encode homologues of RuvC (Rosebush 9), but
is transcribed in the opposite direction ( Fig. 5 ). Maintenance of the RuvC
gene in this location—notwithstanding the genetic rearrangements—isconsistent with this playing an important role in virion assembly, perhapsin resolving any residual Holliday Junctions in replicated DNA moleculesthat otherwise would not be packaged. We note that HJ resolvases are also
present within the virion structure gene operons of some other mycobac-
teriophages (e.g., Cluster E phages 244, Pumpkin and Porky).202

Author's personal copyFIGURE 5 An unusual group of genes in Cluster B genomes. (A) Genome maps of
segments of phages PBI1, Rosebush, Pipefish, and Nigel, representing Subclusters B1, B2,
B3, and B4, respectively, are shown. Segments correspond to the extreme left ends of thegenomes as they are standardly represented, although these genomes are circularly
permuted and terminally redundant, the left end is arbitrarily designated and is not a
physically defined left end. However, genes to the left (i.e., represented at the extremeright end of the genomes) are not evidently related to any of the functions described
here. Five of the six genes to the left of the terminase large subunit gene of Rosebush ( 7)
are predicted to be involved in queuosine biosynthesis, which presumably is used for
tRNA modification (see text), as well as a predicted regulator with ParB-like features
(gene 1). PG1 contains none of these but has a putative terminase small subunit gene ( 1).
Pipefish and Nigel have a subset of the Rosebush functions, including some but not all ofMycobacteriophages 203
Author's personal copyNotable differences exist in the region to the left of terminase genes,
where putative queuosine biosynthetic genes are located in Subcluster B2
phages ( Fig. 5 ). Subcluster B1 and B4 phages encode a terminase small
subunit gene in this location, but Subcluster B2 and B3 phages appear tolack this function. Subcluster B4 phages (e.g., Nigel), however, encodetwo additional rightward-transcribed proteins (gp1 and gp2), and gp1 hassimilarities to ParB proteins, mirroring the putative function of Rosebushgp1 (although the two proteins are not obviously homologues). Interest-ingly, gp2 is predicted by HHPred to encode a queuine-tRNA-ribosyl-transferase, although the protein is not obviously related to Rosebushgp2, and the Subcluster B4 phages do not encode other queuosine biosyn-
thetic genes ( Fig 5 ). The subcluster B3 phage Pipefish has five genes
upstream of the terminase large subunit gene ( 5) (Phaedrus has only
four of these), and it is noteworthy that Pipefish gp1 is a distant relative
of Rosebush gp1, and Pipefish gp4 is likely a QueC-like protein, butwithout significant sequence similarity to Rosebush gp3 ( Fig. 5 ). Pipefish
gp5 is related to ParB-like proteins, although not related with significantsequence similarity to Rosebush gp1. The roles of the gene encoded to theleft of the terminase genes in the Cluster B phages is therefore a substan-
tial mystery, especially as there is great sequence divergence but with
conservation of some common functions.
C. Cluster C
Cluster C currently contains nine phages divided into two subclusters, C1and C2; C2 contains just a single phage, Myrna. All form plaques that arenot completely clear, but also do not form stable lysogens, and theirgenomes do not encode any recognizable features of temperate phages.In general, the eight Cluster C1 phages are very similar to each other,while Myrna differs in a variety of ways. The C1 genomes are all relativelylong but similarly sized (153.7–156.1 kbp) and Myrna is substantiallylarger (165.6 kbp), the largest of all the sequenced mycobacteriophage
genomes. All of the Cluster C phages have myoviral morphologies with
80-nm-diameter isometric heads and modest length (85 nm) contractiletails. Cluster C genomes are circularly permuted and terminally
the genes. (B) Biosynthetic pathways for queuosine biosynthesis. QueF (Rosebush gp6) is
a member of the family of GTP cyclohydrolases (which also includes FolE) and convertsGTP to 7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate. This is converted to 6-pyruvoyltetrahydrop-
terin by QueD (Rosebush gp4), which is then converted to PreQ0 by QueC and QueE
(Rosebush gp3 and gp5, respectively). PreQ0 is transferred to a tRNA substrate by aqueuine-tRNA-ribosyltransferase (Rosebush gp2). None of these phages appears to
encode enzymes that would further process the PreQ0-tRNA to Q-tRNA.204 Graham F. Hatfull
Author's personal copyredundant, although some (such as Bxz1) are unusual in that there is a
long run of G-C residues in the genome through which sequencing reac-tions typically fail ( Pedulla et al., 2003 ). The left end of Bxz1 is arbitrarily
designated as being the first unique base position after the G-string, andthe other Cluster C phage genomes are represented and numberedaccordingly.
The genome organization of the Cluster C representative Bxz1 is
shown in Figure 6 . It differs from all other mycobacteriophages in that
few of the virion structure and assembly genes have been defined and it isnot obvious that they are organized syntenically with respect to thegenomes of Siphoviridae. However, Bxz1 gp124 and gp125 are similar
to major structural proteins of mycobacteriophage I3 ( Ramesh and
Gopinathan, 1994 ), and gp129 is a putative tapemeasure protein, located
immediately downstream of two genes ( 127and 128) predicted to be
expressed via a programmed translational frameshift ( Fig. 6 ). Bxz1
gp135 and gp143 have similarity to other mycobacteriophage minor tail
proteins, gp133 has features suggesting it is a plausible minor tail protein,and gp137 is related to Baseplate J proteins. Thus the region encodinggenes 124–143likely corresponds to a set of genes involved in tail struc-
ture and assembly; we note that Bxz1 gp114 has similarities to some othermycobacteriophage tail proteins ( Fig. 6). The location of the putative
major capsid subunit is unclear, although gp112 has similarity to phagehead decoration proteins.
Bxz1 and its fellow Cluster C phages have a variety of genes whose
putative functions suggest enticing aspects of its biology. For example,Bxz1 gp29 is a Band-7 family protein with two strongly predicted mem-brane-spanning segments at its N terminus ( Fig. 6). Is this protein asso-
ciated with host membranes during phage replication and, if so, what isits function? Is it possible that there are membranes associated with thevirion itself and that gp29 is a virion protein? Answers to these questionsremain unresolved. Bxz1 also encodes two putative glycosyltransferasesand a galactosyltransferase protein, and gp230 is related to Ro proteins(Fig. 6 ). These phages also encode a large number of tRNA genes ( >30;
Table I )(Sahu et al., 2004 ) as well as a tmRNA gene, a putative initiation
factor (gp200), and a peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase (gp164), suggesting sub-
stantial modifications to the host translational machinery ( Fig. 6 ). They
encode a large DNA Pol III asubunit and DnaB/C proteins implicated in
replication initiation and synthesis. In addition to RecA (gp220), Bxz1 also
encodes a RusA-like Holliday junction resolvase (gp205). Many Cluster Cgenomes contain one or more intein insertions. Phage ET08 has a total offive inteins, more than any other mycobacteriophage genome. One ofthese is located in the gp3 putative nucleotidyltranferase gene, and Caligp3 and LRRHood share this intein, as do the RDF proteins of some
Cluster A1 phages (see Section III.A ). A second is in ET08 gene 79andMycobacteriophages 205
Author's personal copyFIGURE 6 Map of the phage Bxz1 genome, a member of Subcluster C1. See Figure 3 A for further details on genome map presentation.
Author's personal copynone of the Cluster C homologues share this intein, although relatives are
present in some terminase genes of nonmycobacteriophage phages, aswell as host DnaB-like helicases. The third ET08 intein is in gp202, which
is also present in homologues in ScottMcG, Spud, Catera, and Rizal, as
well as in some Cluster A terminases (see Section III.A ). ET08 gp239
contains an intein present in all Cluster C homologues except for Bxz1gp239 and Myrna 246, but is related (28% amino acid identity) to the fifthET08 intein, which is in gp248; none of the Cluster C homologues of ET08gp248 contain this intein. Because Cluster C phages are not apparentlytemperate, it is no surprise that they do not encode integrase or partition-ing functions. However, it is striking that one of these—phage
LRRHood—carries a close relative of the Cluster A repressors ( Pope
et al., 2011 ). Specifically, LRRHood gp44 is near identical to the known
Bxb1 repressor (gp69) and differs in only one amino acid substitution (see
Section III.A ,Section V.A.1 , and Fig. 20 ). However, the LRRHood genome
does not contain even a single copy of the 13-bp stoperator sequence,which is the known binding site for this repressor; this, therefore, does notappear to be an immunity system for LRRHood. Presumably LRRHoodhas ‘‘stolen’’ the repressor from a Cluster A1-like phage, and because
there are only between 5- and 11-bp differences between LRRHood gene
44and Cluster A1 repressor genes, this presumably occurred relatively
recently in evolutionary time. A plausible role for LRRHood gp44 mightbe to exclude other phages from superinfecting cells that are undergoinglytic growth of the phage. We note that another example of apparentrepressor theft is seen in Cluster F phages (see Sections III.F and V.A.1 ).
Although the Subcluster C2 phage Myrna shares its myoviral mor-
phology and genome size with Subcluster C1 phages, it is substantially
different at the genomic level. There are segments where synteny is
maintained, including regions corresponding to Bxz1 genes 117–143and
187–211, but other regions, including the leftmost /C2431 kbp, have very few
genes in common. These Cluster C phages therefore represent a reallyintriguing collection of viruses whose genomes suggest many secretswaiting to be discovered.
D. Cluster D
There are six closely related phages in Cluster D, and no subclusterdivisions ( Table I ). These phages form plaques that are not completely
clear, and although not evidently turbid as phages such as L5 or Bxb1, it ispossible that they are temperate and form lysogens at low frequency.
However, the genomes reveal no features associated with temperate
phages such as integrases or repressors. The genomes are presumed tobe circularly permuted and terminally redundant, and the left end isarbitrarily designated at a noncoding gap 6-7 genes to the left of theMycobacteriophages 207
Author's personal copyterminase large subunit gene; a gene map of the Cluster D representative,
PBI1, is shown in Figure 7 . All of the PBI1 genes, except for 41and42, are
transcribed rightward ( Fig. 7), and the virion structure and assembly
genes are located in the left part of the genome ( 8-31); although confident
assignments can be ascribed to the terminase large subunit gene ( 8), portal
(9), tapemeasure ( 27), and minor tail proteins ( 30,31), assignments of
capsid subunit ( 17) and major tail subunit genes ( 24) are less confident.
None of the virion proteins have been characterized experimentally. Thelysis cassette, including lysin A and lysin B genes ( 35and39, respectively),
is located immediately downstream of the virion structure and assemblyoperon ( Fig. 7 ). PBI1 genes 36-38all encode proteins with putative trans-
membrane domains (two, four, and one, respectively) and at least one mayact as a holin. None of the Cluster D phages infect M. tuberculosis . Genes in
the right half of the genome contain several that are likely involved inDNA replication, including a helicase ( 50), a DNA polymerase III asub-
unit ( 63), and a primase/polymerase gene ( 81). Several other genes in this
region are implicated in nucleotide metabolism, including a putativenucleotide-binding protein ( 56), a putative deoxyribonucleotidase ( 59),
and ThyX ( 65). Gene 57encodes a 309 residue protein containing a highly
acidic segment in its C-terminal half (76 of 79 resides are aspartic orglutamic acids) and has weak similarity to CDC45-related proteins,implicating it in a possible role in initiation of DNA replication.
A particularly intriguing aspect of Cluster D phages is genes immedi-
ately to the left of the terminase large subunit gene ( 8). Five of the six
Cluster D phages (PBI1, Adjutor, P-lot, Butterscotch, and Troll4) eachencode a 256 residue protein (PBI gp7; Fig. 7 ) with similarity to vegetative
insecticidal protein 2 (VIP2) family proteins encoding actin-ADP-ribosy-
lating toxins ( Han et al., 1999 ). In phage Gumball, the gene encoding VIP2
is part of a single gene ( 6) that also contains sequences corresponding to
PBI1 gene 6, as a result of an additional A-residue immediately upstream
of the VIP2 moiety. Although this mutation could have arisen during
propagation of the phage in the laboratory and perhaps renders it non-functional, an alternative possibility is that PBI1 gene 6encodes a function
related to VIP2-like activity and that the two units can function either asindependent proteins (as in PBI gp6 and gp7) or as two domains of a
single protein (as in Gumball gp6). None of these proteins contain puta-
tive signal sequences and it is plausible that they are expressed late in lyticgrowth (together with their closely linked virion structure and assemblygenes) and are released upon cell lysis, a parallel scenario to the expres-sion and release of toxin from E. coli phage 933W ( Tyler et al., 2004 ). In
light of
the similarity to insecticidal toxins, it is puzzling as to what role is
played by PBI1 gp7 and its related proteins. Do Cluster D phages conferinsecticidal properties to infected cells and, if so, what is the natural
bacterial host and what insects are affected? These questions remain
unresolved.208

Author's personal copyE. Cluster E
There are five Cluster E phages, all are very similar to each other at the
nucleotide sequence level—albeit with a variety of replacements, inser-
tions, and deletions—and there are no subcluster divisions ( Table I ). They
form plaques with some turbidity and likely form lysogens, althoughstable lysogens have not been reported for any Cluster E phages. Prelimi-nary data from our laboratory suggest that Cjw1 may form stable lyso-gens at 42
/C14C, but not at 37/C14C. None of these phages infect M.tuberculosis .
A map of the genome organization of the Cluster E representative phage,Cjw1, is shown in Figure 8 . It encodes both small and large subunits of
terminase, and the small subunit gene is approximately 1 kbp away fromthe physical left end of the genome ( Fig. 9 ). The terminase large subunit
genes of Cjw1 and Kostya (gp8 and gp9 respectively) both contain inteinsrelated to those in some of the Cluster A1 terminases (see Section III.A ).
The virion structure and assembly operon spans from genes 5to28and
follows the canonical synteny, but with two notable interruptions. First, inPumpkin, Porky, and 244, but not in Cjw1 or Kostya, an EndoVII Holidayjunction resolvase gene lies between the frameshifting tail assembly cha-
perones and the tapemeasure protein. Although this is an unusual posi-
tion for a gene insertion, presence of a HJ resolvase in the virion structuraloperon is reminiscent of the organization of Cluster B genomes (seeSection III.B ). Presumably it is not essential for growth because Cjw1
and Kostya lack this gene and no obvious candidates exist for providingthis function elsewhere in their genomes. Second, in Cjw1 (and Pumpkinand 244), two small genes are located between the terminase small andlarge subunit genes, transcribed in the opposite direction and of unknown
function ( Fig. 8 ); one of these (Cjw1 17) is absent from Kostya and Porky.
Genes related to Cjw1 8are also found in Cluster B4 genomes (e.g.,
Cooper 98), elevating confidence in their assignment. The lysis cassette
lies to the right of the virion structure and assembly genes and includes
both Lysin A and Lysin B genes (Cjw1 32and35, respectively); Cjw1 gene
33is a strong candidate for encoding a holin with two membrane-span-
ning domains. Genes to the right of this appear to be organized into sixputative operons: (1) leftward-transcribed genes 38–52, (2) genes 53(inte-
grase) and 54that are transcribed rightward, (3) leftward-transcribed
genes 55and 56, (4) genes 57–128transcribed rightward, (5) leftward-
transcribed genes 129–142, and (6) genes 143and144that are transcribed
rightward. In general, this organization is conserved in all Cluster Ephages. Although the vast majority of genes in Cluster E genomes are ofunknown function ( >80%), several of those that do have functional
assignments are rare among the mycobacteriophages and are of consider-able interest. First, Cjw1 gene 39encodes a relative of Lsr2, a regulatory
protein present in the mycobacterial host that coordinates expression of a210

Author's personal copylarge number of host genes. Its role in Cjw1 is not clear, although we note
that Cluster J genomes also encode related proteins (see Sections III.J ). It is
plausible that this confers the repressor function in Cluster E phages,
although this would be a very unusual form of phage regulation.
Second, the long operon 57–128includes several genes encoding puta-
tive functions in DNA replication, recombination, RNA metabolism, and
nucleotide metabolism. Cjw1 gene 70is related to Erf-family recombinases
and presumably mediates general recombination functions. Althoughseveral other mycobacteriophages encode RecA-like and RecET-likerecombination functions, Cluster E phages—along with Omega (ClusterL) and Wildcat—are the only ones with an Erf-like protein; somewhat
surprisingly, Cluster E phages also encode RecA homologues (e.g., Cjw1
gp117). Cjw1 encodes a tRNA
glygene ( 109) in this region, as well as a
tRNA-like gene in the small intergenic gap between genes 108and 109,
although the noncanonical tRNA structure and four-base anticodon sug-gest that this is either nonfunctional or perhaps plays a role in translationalframeshifting. The RNA Ligase encoded by Cjw1 gene 93is also unusual
but related proteins are also encoded in Cluster L and J phages. Likewise,Cjw1 gene 102encoding a single-stranded binding protein (SSB) is only
found elsewhere in Cluster L phages and the singleton Wildcat. Cjw1 gp89has been shown to be a bifunctional polynucleotide kinase (Pnk) with bothkinase and phosphatase domains, and it was noted that because Cjw1—like Omega (see Section III.J )—also encodes an RNA Ligase (gp93), that
these might act to evade an RNA-damaging antiviral host response(Zhu et al., 2004 ). Interestingly, we note that the Cluster L phage LeBron
also encodes similar Pnk and RNA Ligase proteins (see Section III.L ;
Fig. 15 ). Moreover, this highly diverse set of phages also encodes one
or more tRNA genes ( Table I ). Finally, Cjw1 gene 115encodes a protein
with similarity to DnaQ-like proteins, suggesting a possible role in DNArepair or perhaps in phage replication itself. Roles for these interestingproteins, their biochemical activities, and their expression patterns awaitelucidation.
F. Cluster F
Cluster F is one of the more diverse groups of phages at the nucleotidesequence level. There are a total of 10 members, with all but 1 (Che9d)constituting Subcluster F1, and Che9d forming Subcluster F2. They formsomewhat turbid plaques from which stable lysogens can be recovered(Pham et al., 2007 ). Genomes vary somewhat in length, ranging from 52.1
kbp [Ardmore, ( Henry et al., 2010b )] to 59.5 kbp [Che8 ( Pedulla et al.,
2003)](Table I ), but all have defined cohesive termini. None of the
Cluster F phages infect M.tuberculosis . The complete sequence of myco-
bacteriophage Ms6 is not yet available, but from sequenced segments ofMycobacteriophages 213
Author's personal copythe genome it seems probable that it belongs to the F cluster. The genome
map of the Cluster F representative phage, Fruitloop, is shown in Figure 9 .
Fruitloop encodes both terminase small and large subunits, and the small
subunit gene is very close to the physical left end of the genome ( Fig. 9 ).
The virion structure and assembly operon extends from gene 1to gene 24,
transcribed rightward, and is fairly canonical with regard to the common
syntenic organization ( Fig. 9 ). The block of genes corresponding to the
region from Fruitloop 11(major ail subunit) to gene 23(putative minor tail
protein) is the most highly conversed segment among Cluster F1 phages atthe nucleotide level. The region to the left of Fruitloop gene 11is substan-
tially different in Ramsey and Boomer, although the genes are likely to
confer similar functions in DNA packaging and head assembly. The lysis
cassette lies to the right of the virion structure and assembly genes andincludes lysin A ( 29) and lysin B ( 30) genes; gp31 is a likely Holin and
contains a single predicted transmembrane domain ( Fig 9). Immediately to
the right of the lysis cassette is a DnaQ-like gene ( 34) implicated either in
DNA repair, or perhaps DNA replication itself, as in Cluster E phages.
Genes in the right part of the Fruitloop genome are organized into four
possible operons: (1) genes 37–39,( 2 )g e n e s 40–42,(3) genes 43and44,a n d
(4) genes 45–102. The first of these is of particular interest, as Fruitloop genes
37–39do not have closely related counterparts in other Cluster F phages, but
are homologues to genes in Cluster A phages; gp37 and gp38 are closerelatives of Bxb1 gp69 and gp70, respectively; and gp39 is most closelyrelated to Jasper gp92. Bxb1 gp69 is a well-characterized repressor relatedto the L5 repressor ( Jain and Hatfull, 2000 ) and its presence in Fruitloop is
somewhat surprising (see Sections III.A and V.A.1). Two lines of evidencesuggest that Fruitloop gp37 is not involved directly in the immunity regula-
tion of Fruitloop itself, in that it is absent from all other Cluster F genomes,
and there is not an abundant array of stoperator sites throughout theFruitloop genome as there are in Bxb1 and its relatives (see Section III.A).There is, however, a single putative 13-bp repressor-binding site locatedupstream of gene 39near a strongly predicted putative leftward promoter,
which thus may be involved in autoregulation of its expression. We alsonote that the nucleotide sequences of Fruitloop 37and38are/C2498% identical
with their Bxb1 homologues, suggesting that these were acquired very
recently in evolutionary times. A plausible scenario is that Fruitloop has
stolen these genes from a Cluster A-like phage for purposes of conferring arogue immunity status, providing protection to Fruitloop lysogens fromsuperinfection by Cluster A-type phages that have a Bxb1 type of immunity.A similar example of apparent repressor theft occurs in the Subcluster C1phage LRRHood (see Section III.C).
The rightward operon encompassing genes 40–42contains the inte-
grase gene ( 40) plus two genes ( 41,42) that are candidates for forming a
toxin–antitoxin (TA) system; Fruitloop gp41 is the putative toxin and gp42214
Graham F. Hatfull
Author's personal copyis the putative antitoxin. There are no identifiable relatives of these in
other Cluster F phages or indeed in any other mycobacteriophages. TAsystems generally are not common in phage genomes, although the well-
studied plasmid addiction system of phage P1 is within this general class
(Lehnherr et al., 1993 ). However, it seems unlikely that genes 41and42are
involved in plasmid maintenance of Fruitloop similar to P1 becauseFruitloop encodes an integrase (gp40) and presumably provides pro-phage maintenance through stable integration. Because it has beenreported that TA systems can provide protection to bacterial cultures byconferring abortive infection ( Fineran et al., 2009 ), an intriguing hypothe-
sis is that this Fruitloop TA system has been acquired to provide protec-
tion to Fruitloop lysogens by infection from other phages. In this model,
addition of the Bxb1 repressor and the putative TA system has beenselected for by the same core property of providing survival of the hostto subsequent viral attack.
The vast majority of genes in the Fruitloop rightward operon contain-
ing genes 45–102are of unknown function, but several are of interest.
First, gene 45encodes a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding protein, which
could either provide repressor activity or possibly a Cro-like function.
Second, Fruitloop gene 55encodes a WhiB-family transcriptional regula-
tor protein, and although WhiB-related proteins are encoded by several
mycobacteriophages, their roles remain unclear ( Rybniker et al. , 2010 ).
Third, gene 100encodes a putative serine-threonine kinase of unknown
function, and it is unclear whether it is phosphorylating host or phageproteins. Fourth, there are two putative genes encoding glycosyltransfer-ase enzymes, although the roles and the targets of these are alsounknown. Finally, gene 71is part of a MycobacterioPhage Mobile Ele-
ment (MPME2)(see Sections III.G and IV) that is prevalent throughoutCluster F phages and was first identified through genome comparison ofCluster G phages ( Sampson et al., 2009 ).
G. Cluster G
Four Cluster G phages are extremely closely related to each other at thenucleotide sequence level and there are no subcluster divisions. Thesephages have among the smallest mycobacteriophage genomes, rangingfrom 41.1 to 42.3 kbp in length. As discussed later, the primary cause forlength differences is the presence/absence of a novel small putativemobile genetic element (MPME), which is absent from Angel and presentas a single copy but in a different location in each of the other three
genomes. Cluster G phages form lightly turbid plaques from which stable
lysogens can be recovered ( Sampson et al., 2009 ). They do not infect M.
tuberculosis at high efficiency, but mutants arise at a frequency of /C2410
-5
that have acquired the ability to infect M.tuberculosis at equal efficiency toMycobacteriophages 215
Author's personal copyM.smegmatis (Sampson et al., 2009 ). A genome map of the Cluster G
representative phage, BPs, is shown in Figure 10 . Cluster G genomes
have defined cohesive ends, and a putative small terminase subunit
gene ( 1) is located near the left physical end of the genome ( Fig. 10 ). The
virion structure and assembly operon encompasses genes 1through 26
and is organized with canonical synteny. The lysis cassette follows imme-
diately after and contains both lysin A and lysin B genes ( 27and 28,
respectively; Fig.10 ); gene 29encodes a putative holin, based on the
presence of two putative transmembrane domains. The only leftward-transcribed genes in the genome are 32and33, encoding the integrase and
repressor proteins, respectively, and genes to their right are all tran-
scribed rightward. Most of the genes in this rightward operon are of
unknown function, although it also includes a RecET recombinationsystem (gp42 and gp43) and a RuvC-like Holliday Junction resolvase(gp51).
A rather striking feature of repressor/integrase gene organization is
that the crossover site for integrase-mediated, site-specific recombinationwithin the phage attachment site ( attP) is located within the coding region
for the repressor ( Sampson et al., 2009 ). As a consequence, two different
types of gene product are expressed from gene 33: a 130 residue product
from the viral genome and a 97 residue product from an integratedprophage. The 97 residue protein confers immunity and provides therepressor function, whereas the virally expressed 130 residue proteindoes not. Integration and excision would therefore seem to play criticalroles in the decision between lysogenic and lytic growth, having a directimpact on whether an active or an inactive repressor is expressed(Sampson et al., 2009 ). A particularly interesting question arises as to
how the genetic switch operates and whether phage-encoded cII and/orcIII analogues modulate the frequencies of lysogeny or whether this isaccomplished solely by the gene 32–33cassette (see Section V.A.2).
The close nucleotide sequence similarity between Cluster G genomes
proved crucial in identification of a new class of ultrasmall mobile geneticelements present in mycobacteriophages ( Sampson et al., 2009 ). For exam-
ple, when BP is compared with the other three genomes, it is apparentthat the small open reading frames BPs 57and 59form a single gene in
Angel, Hope, and Halo ( Pope et al., 2011 ;Sampson et al., 2009 ). Alignment
of DNA sequences shows that there is a precise insertion of 445 bp,including the open reading frame for gene 58, in BPs relative to the
other phages ( Figs. 10 B and 10C). Such alignments also show similar
relationships reflecting an insertion in Halo that has occurred at a targetwithin the homologue of BP gene 54and in Hope at a target within the
homologue of BP gene 56(Fig. 10 C). Alignment of the inserted sequences
shows that there are two types of these MPME elements, MPME1 (in
Hope and BPs) and MPME2 (in Halo), that share 78% nucleotide sequence216

genome map presentation. (B) MPME elements are 439–440 bp in length and are flanked by 11-bp imperfect inverted repeats, IR-L and IR-R.
Insertion into the target is associated by a 6-bp insertion between IR-L and the target, and its origin is unknown. (C) A 5.5-kbp segment at the
extreme right end of the Angel genome is shown, illustrating the positions of the insertion of MPME1 elements in BPs and Halo, and an MPME2
insertion in phage Hope.
Author's personal copysimilarity ( Sampson et al., 2009 ); Angel is devoid of these elements
(Sampson et al., 2009 ). Comparison against other mycobacteriophages
shows that there is a single copy of MPME1 in Cluster F phages Fruitloop,
PMC, Llij, Boomer, Che8, Tweety, Ardmore and Pacc40; in Cluster I
phages Brujita and Island 3; and a partial copy in Corndog. There areno related copies in any of the sequenced mycobacterial genomes orelsewhere ( Sampson et al., 2009 ).
Although the size of each of the MPME1 insertions is 445 bp, the
mobile element itself appears to be 439 bp long, with two imperfect11-bp inserted repeats (IR) at the extreme ends ( Sampson et al., 2009 )
(Fig. 10 B). At the right end, IR-R is joined to the target sequence without
addition or duplication of any target sequences ( Fig.10 B). However, at the
left junction, there is an insertion of 6 bp between IR-L and the targetDNA. This 6-bp segment is different in many of the insertions and doesnot correspond to target duplication. It therefore remains a mystery as towhere this 6 bp originates from and what mechanism of transpositioncould be involved in generating these types of products. Transposition ispresumably mediated by the 123 residue product encoded within theMPME element ( Fig. 10 B), although this is both remarkably small and
shows no motifs to structural elements common to other transposases.
The MPME elements show that the three genes containing insertions
(corresponding to BPs genes 54,56, and the gene 57–59interruption;
Fig. 10 ) are presumably nonessential for phage growth. However, because
there are no obvious differences in growth of the four Cluster G phages,this provides little information as to what the genes actually do and whythey may have been acquired by the phages—they are simply nonessen-tial. Cluster G genomes are suitable substrates for BRED manipulation
(see Section VII.A.6), and four additional genes (BPs genes 44,49,50, and
52) have also been shown to be nonessential because viable deletion
mutants can be constructed readily. This raises the question as to whether
it is generally true that a high proportion of genes constituting the non-virion structure and assembly genes are nonessential in the mycobacter-iophages and, if so, what forces drive the evolutionary of this largenumber of mysterious genes.
H. Cluster H
There are three phages assigned to Cluster H: two (Predator and Kon-stantine) in Subcluster H1 and one (Barnyard) in Subcluster H2 (Hatfullet al., 2010 ;Pope et al., 2011 ). The cluster is quite diverse and many
differences exist among the three constituting genomes. These phagesform plaques that are not evidently turbid, but also not completelyclear, although stable lysogens have not been recovered; the genomesalso do not possess features of temperate phages such as integrase orMycobacteriophages 219
Author's personal copyrepressor genes. They all have termini consistent with the viral chromo-
somes being circularly permuted and terminally redundant. They haveamong the lowest of the GC% content of the mycobacteriophages ( Fig. 2 ),
and none of them infect M.tuberculosis .
The genomic organization of a Cluster H representative, Barnyard, is
shown in Figure 11 . The left end of Barnyard is designated arbitrarily at
the first noncoding interval to the left of the terminase large subunit gene(6), and the functions of the five intervening genes are unknown; none of
these is an obvious candidate for a terminase small subunit gene (Fig. 11 ).
All of the predicted genes are transcribed in the rightward direction asshown in Figure 11 , and an obvious genomic feature is the presence of the
large number of orphams (genes belonging to a phamily that has only asingle member), nearly 60% of all 109 predicted Barnyard genes. Such ahigh proportion of orphams is not unexpected in singleton phage gen-omes where other closely related phages have yet to be isolated, but forBarnyard this reflects the degree to which it—as a Subcluster H2 phage—differs from Subcluster H1 phages. Subcluster H1 phages Predator andKonstantine have 18 and 25% orphams, respectively, again reflecting thegenerally high diversity of this cluster. This is in marked contrast to, for
example, Cluster G phages, which differ mostly by just a relatively mod-
est number of nucleotide differences (see Section III.G).
The virion structure and assembly genes span from gene 6through to
gene 36, and genes encoding the terminase large subunit ( 6), portal ( 7), a
putative protease ( 17), capsid subunit ( 21), major tail subunit ( 30), tail
assembly chaperones expressed by a putative programmed translationalframeshift ( 31and 32), tapemeasure protein, and putative minor tail
proteins ( 34-36) are predicted ( Fig. 11 ). Although these genes are in
canonical order, several small additional genes are present between theputative portal and protease genes, and also between the capsid andmajor tail subunit genes. The tapemeasure gene is notable due to itsimpressive length (6.1 kbp), corresponding to the very long tails of theCluster H phages ( /C24300 nm). In Predator—although not the other Cluster
H phages—there is a putative Endo VII Holliday Junction resolvase ( 10)
located between the portal and protease genes, reminiscent of the locationof functionally related genes in some Cluster B and E genomes. The lysis
cassette, containing lysin A ( 39) and lysin B ( 40) genes, as well as a
putative holin ( 41), lies immediately to the right of the virion structure
and assembly operon ( Fig. 11 ). Of the 67 genes in the Barnyard genome to
the right of the lysis cassette, only 13 have homologues in other
mycobacteriophages; 8 of these are found only in Subcluster H1 phages.Five genes in this region can be assigned putative functions, including aHelicase ( 65), a putative nucleotide-binding protein ( 75), an asubunit of
DNA polymerase III ( 80), a peptidase ( 94), and a large primase/polymer-
ase gene ( 108).220

Author's personal copyThe GC% of Cluster H phages is among the lowest of all the myco-
bacteriophages (56.3–57.3%, Fig. 2 ), and only the singleton Wildcat shares
a GC% content lower than 60% (56.9%). This may reflect a preference of
the Cluster H phages for hosts that are more distantly related to M.
smegmatis , and although the majority of members of the Actinomycetales
have GC% contents that are above 60%, some—such as M. leprae
(57.8%)—do have a substantially lower GC% content. Such a different
host preference may account for notable differences of Cluster H phagesfrom other mycobacteriophages and the high proportions of orphams(Fig. 11 ). Cluster H phages thus remain largely unexplored and would
seem to warrant extensive further analysis both in regards to the determi-
nation of gene function and expression and in elucidation of their host
ranges.
I. Cluster I
Cluster I contains three phage members: two (Brujita and Island3) inSubcluster I1 and one (Che9c) in Subcluster I2. They are quite diverse atthe sequence level, although the two Subcluster I1 phages share nucleo-
tide sequence similarity across most of their genomes. Che9c is both more
distantly related and has a substantially larger genome (57 kbp) thanSubcluster I1 genomes ( /C2447 kbp). Cluster I phages form somewhat turbid
plaques, although lysogens have not been well characterized. They do,however, encode genes common to temperate phages such as an integra-tion system; no repressor genes have been described. All Cluster I phageshave defined cohesive termini, and gene 1is a reasonable candidate for
encoding a terminase small subunit ( Fig. 12 ). None of the Cluster I phages
infect M.tuberculosis . A notable morphological feature of Cluster I phages
is that they contain prolate heads, with a length to width ratio of approxi-mately 2.5:1 ( Hatfull et al., 2010 ). The genome organization of a Cluster I
representative, Che9c, is shown in Figure 12 . The virion structure and
assembly operon (gene 1–22) is syntenically canonical, and genes encod-
ing terminase large subunit ( 2), portal ( 4), protease ( 5), capsid ( 6), major
tail subunit ( 12), tail assembly chaperones ( 13and14), tapemeasure ( 15),
and minor tail proteins ( 16–19) can be predicted confidently ( Fig. 12 ). The
lysis cassette lies to the right of the virion structure and assembly operonand includes genes encoding lysin A ( 25), lysin B ( 26), and a putative
holin (27) containing two predicted membrane-spanning domains. To theright of the lysis genes are perhaps four operons: (1) gene 30and 31
transcribed leftward, (2) genes 32–36transcribed rightward, (3) genes
37–46transcribed leftward (although two large intergenic regions exist
between genes 39and40and between 45and56so there could be multiple
operons; Fig. 12 ), and (4) genes 47–84transcribed rightward.222
Graham F. Hatfull
Author's personal copyFIGURE 12 Map of the phage Che9c genome, a member of Subcluster I2. See Figure 3 A for further details on genome map presentation.
Author's personal copySeveral of the genes in these operons encode putative transcriptional
regulators, including genes 30,32, 46 , and 47. Che9c gp32 is unusual in
that it is related to the IrrE regulator of Deinococcus radiodurans and there
are no similar genes elsewhere in the mycobacteriophages; it contains
both putative DNA recognition and protease motifs. Gene 46encodes a
large protein with a putative helix-turn-helix motif near its N terminus,and gene 47encodes a smaller helix-turn-helix containing a predicted
DNA-binding protein. Any of these could plausibly play the role of thephage repressor, but it is curious that there are such a variety of putativeregulatory proteins. Che9c gene 41encodes a tyrosine-integrase and a
putative Xis encoded by gene 50, displaced almost 7 kbp from the int
gene. A putative attP common core can be identified immediately adja-
cent to the integrase gene, and Che9c is predicted to integrate at an attB
site overlapping a host tRNA
tyrgene (see Section V.B.1 and Table II).
Cluster I1 phages have a different integration specificity and are pre-dicted to integrate into a tRNA
thrgene (see Section V.B.1 and Table II).
The attP site of Che9c is notable because whereas other phages that
integrate into tRNA genes carry the 30end of the host tRNA, Che9c is
predicted to encode a complete tRNAtyrgene at this position. However,
the predicted tRNA has a number of nonstandard features that bring intoquestion whether this is either expressed or functional, and it is possiblethat it is just a bioinformatic quirk.
The segment to the left of the Che9c integrase contains several genes of
interest, including one encoding a putative PE/PPE-like protein ( 35), and
an LpqJ-like predicted lipoprotein containing a single transmembranedomain; gp38 is also a predicted membrane protein with three mem-brane-spanning domains. Although nothing is known about the expres-
sion patterns of Che9c or any other Cluster I phages, it is tempting to
suggest that these genes were acquired relatively recently from a bacterialchromosome through an errant excision process and are expressed froman integrated prophage, perhaps conferring new properties to lysogenicstrains. Che9c gp38 is related more closely to the LpqJ protein ofM.smegmatis (Msmeg_0704 product) than to other bacteria, but these
share only 42% amino acid sequence identity, making it unlikely that itwas a recent acquisition from this host specifically. The region to the right
of integrase contains five leftward-transcribed genes, all of which are
orphams, and genes 42,43, and 44are all related to large families of
hypothetical bacterial proteins of unknown function; there is an unusu-ally large noncoding region ( /C241.1 kbp) between genes 45and46. The GC
% content of the 4.7-kbp gene 42–46region is substantially different
(59.9%) from the overall GC% of the Che9c genome (65.4%), consistentwith the interpretation that it has been acquired relatively recently byhorizontal genetic exchange, most likely from a bacterial host. Further-
more, the genome organization of Che9c is similar to Subcluster I1 phages224
Graham F. Hatfull
Author's personal copyto the left of Che9c gene 19, and the similarity—although still rather
weak—does not pick up again until to the right of Che9c gene 51. Differ-
ences in lengths of the intervening regions account for the 10-kbp differ-
ences in overall genome lengths. The rightward-transcribed operon
containing genes 47–64encodes a number of genes of interest. These
include RecET-like genes ( 60and 61), which are of note because they
have been exploited to develop a system for recombineering in mycobac-teria ( van Kessel and Hatfull, 2007, 2008a,b ;van Kessel et al., 2008 ) and of
the mycobacteriophages themselves ( Marinelli et al., 2008 )(see Section VII.
A.6). Gene 64encodes a RusA-like Holliday Junction resolvase, gene 75
encodes a putative peptidase, and gene 82encodes a protein predicted to
encode polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activity; Subclus-
ter F1 and the Subcluster C2 phage Myrna encode similar enzymes, and itis of considerable interest to identify which proteins—either phage orperhaps host encoded—are targets of glycosylation. Interestingly, Sub-cluster I1 phages Brujita and Island3 lack homologues of Che9c gene 82,
but at the right ends of their genomes encode a protein with a differentsequence but which is predicted to have the same activity as Che9c gp82.Cluster I genomes clearly are rich in features of interest and warrant
substantial further investigation.
J. Cluster J
Cluster J contains the published genome Omega and unpublished phagesLittleE and Baka; the genome organization of Omega is shown in
Figure 13 . Omega forms slightly turbid plaques from which stable lyso-
gens can be recovered (G. Broussard and Graham F. Hatfull, unpublishedresults) and does not infect M. tuberculosis . The genome is 110 kbp long and
contains defined cohesive termini, although with unusually short 4-basesingle-stranded DNA extensions ( Pedulla et al., 2003 )(see Section VI.A).
The left end is /C241.5 kbp from the putative terminase small subunit gene,
and the virion structure and assembly genes extend to approximately gene
44(Fig. 13 ). Genes encoding terminase small ( 3) and large subunits ( 11),
portal ( 13), protease ( 14), capsid ( 15), major tail subunit ( 31), tail assembly
chaperones expressed via a programmed translational frameshift ( 32and
33), tapemeasure ( 34), and minor tail proteins ( 35–40) can be predicted
with reasonable confidence ( Fig. 13 ); the terminase large subunit contains
an intein similar to that in some Cluster A and E terminases (see Sections
III.A and III.E). However, this operon contains many interruptions withinsertions of genes transcribed both in forward and reverse directions
(Fig. 13 ). For example, there are seven small open reading frames ( 4–10)
of unknown function between terminase small and large subunit genes,
and immediately to the right of capsid genes are open reading framesencoding putative glycosyltransferase and O-methyltransferase activitiesMycobacteriophages 225
Author's personal copyFIGURE 13 Map of the phage Omega genome, a member of Cluster J. See Figure 3 A for further details on genome map presentation.
Author's personal copy(Fig. 13 ). It is unclear what the specific functions of these genes are,
although their location within the virion structure and assembly operon
suggests the intriguing possibility that they are modifying virion proteins.
Leftward-transcribed genes 21and22are of unknown function, although
there are homologues of both in the Subcluster A1 phage, Bethlehem (gp71
and gp72)(see Section III.A). Omega gp21 also has weak sequence similar-ity to IS110 family transposases, and thus both Omega genes 21and 22
could conceivably belong to an uncharacterized IS110-like transposon.The absence of this segment in the LittleE genome—as well as the relatedinsertion in Bethlehem—strongly supports this possibility.
The Omega lysis cassette lies to the right of the virion structure and
assembly genes, and includes lysin A ( 50) and lysin B ( 53) genes—
separated by an HNH domain gene ( 51) and a gene of unknown function
(52)—as well as a putative holin ( 54). To the right of this is a leftward-
transcribed operon containing 28 small open reading frames. Accurateannotation of the many small genes in phage genomes is an ongoingchallenge, but this operon presents a good example of the utility of com-parative genomic analyses because more than half of these are related togenes in mycobacteriophages in other clusters and subclusters ( Fig. 13 );
Omega genes 77,79,81, and 83all belong to a relatively large phamily with
representatives of the total of 104 members in virtually all clusters of phages.Gene 61is of interest because it encodes a homologue of the host lsr2gene,
which has been shown to be a global regulator of gene expression in M.
tuberculosis (Colangeli et al., 2007, 2009 )(see Section III.E). It is unclear what
functional role there could be for Omega gp16, perhaps acting as a regulatorof phage gene expression, but more enticingly as a possible regulator thatreprograms host gene expression of lysogenic strains.
Although the Omega genome is replete with orphams and genes of
unknown function, several genes with predicted functions make themodd denizens of a phage genome. For example, gene 206encodes a
homologue of bacterial Ku-like proteins involved in mediating nonho-mologous end joining (NHEJ)( Pitcher et al., 2007 ). Ku-like proteins typi-
cally act together with a dedicated DNA ligase (Lig IV), which is absentfrom the Omega genome ( Pitcher et al. , 2006 ). Interestingly, the NHEJ
system seems to be required for Omega infection and presumably is
required for genome recircularization upon infection ( Pitcher et al.,
2006). Further details are provided in Section VI.B. We note that the
only other mycobacteriophage to encode a Ku-like protein is the singleton
mycobacteriophage Corndog (gp87)(see Section III.M.1) and it too has4-base ssDNA extensions ( Pitcher et al., 2006 ).
Just to the left of the Ku-like protein gene, gene 203encodes an
FtsK-like protein. Bacterial FtsK proteins, including that of M. smegmatis ,
contain three domains: an N-terminal domain involved in membrane
association; a central domain containing motor functions, including aMycobacteriophages 227
Author's personal copyAAA-ATPase motif; and a short C-terminal domain (gamma) that confers
the specificity of DNA binding ( Sivanathan et al., 2006 ). Its primary
function in bacteria is to facilitate proper segregation of daughter chro-
mosomes at cell division. Omega gp203 is a 443 residue protein that lacks
the N-terminal domain of bacterial FtsK proteins and contains just thecore domain and a putative C-terminal gamma domain. However,although the core domain is quite closely related to that of M.smegmatis
FtsK (60% amino acid identity), the gamma domain is distinctly differentand is not closely related to the gamma domains of any other known FtsKproteins. The presence of this FtsK-like gene in a phage genome is highlyunusual, and its role is unknown ( Pedulla et al., 2003 ). It is possible that it
acts on a host chromosome that contains different 8-bp asymmetric FtsKOrienting Polar Sequences (KOPS) targeting sequences for gp203 recogni-tion, and although such a host has apparently yet to be described geno-mically, it is not obviously M.smegmatis . Alternatively, it could be acting
on the Omega genome itself, and it would be of interest to determinebioinformatically or experimentally if Omega contains KOPS-like gp203-binding sites. We note, however, that gp203 is unlikely to simply facilitatepartitioning of extrachromosomally replicating prophage molecules
because Omega encodes an integrase (gp85), as well as a putative excise
(gp84), and Omega lysogens contain an integrated prophage (G. Brous-sard and Graham F. Hatfull, unpublished results)(Fig. 13). Omega alsoencodes a number of proteins predicted to be involved in DNA metabo-lism, including a DnaQ-like protein ( 183), DNA methylases ( 127,128,
165), and an AddA-like protein. Curiously, it encodes three proteins
with sequence similarity to EndoVII Holliday Junction resolvases ( 89,
138, and 199). It is unclear why any phage genome would need to encode
HJ resolvase activity in three separate genes. Omega—with its curiouscollection of genes with predicted functions and its vast array of hundredsof genes of unknown function—clearly warrants much more detailedinvestigations to understand gene expression and gene function andhow these contribute to the overall biology of this phage and its ClusterJ relatives. Omega also encodes a bifunctional polynucleotide kinase(gp136, Pnk) similar to that of Cjw1 and is proposed to act with theRNA Ligase (gp162) to evade an RNA-damaging host response ( Zhu
et al., 2004 ). Omega encodes two putative tRNAs: a tRNA
gly(gene 192)
closely related to the one in Cjw1 and a noncanonical putative tRNA witha 4-base anticodon also similar to that encoded by Cjw1 (see Section III.E).
K. Cluster K
Cluster K contains three genomes divided into two subclusters: K1 andK2. Subcluster K1 contains Angelica and CrimD, and Subcluster K2 con-tains TM4; three additional unpublished phages also belong to this cluster228
Graham F. Hatfull
Author's personal copy(Pope et al., 2011 ). TM4 and its derivatives are perhaps the most widely
utilized in mycobacterial genetics, and a map of TM4 genome organiza-
tion is shown in Figure 14 . All of the Cluster K phages infect M.tuberculo-
sisas well as M.smegmatis , and TM4 was originally isolated by recovery
from a putative lysogenic strain of Mycobacterium avium (Timme and
Brennan, 1984 ). TM4 forms clear plaques on mycobacterial lawns,
whereas the other Cluster K phages form turbid plaques from whichstable lysogens can be recovered.
Cluster K phages contain defined cohesive termini ( Table I ), and the
terminase large subunit gene is located near the physical left end ( Fig. 14 ).
All of the genes are transcribed in the rightward direction, with the
exception of genes 39–41. Genes 4through 25encode the virion structure
and assembly functions, and genes encoding terminase large subunit ( 4),
portal ( 5), protease ( 6), scaffold ( 8), capsid ( 9), major tail subunit ( 14), tail
assembly chaperones expressed via a programmed translational frame-
shift ( 15,16), tapemeasure protein ( 17), and minor tail proteins ( 18–25) can
be predicted with reasonable confidence ( Fig. 14 ). To the right of the
structural genes lies the lysis cassette, and this included both lysin A(29) and lysin B ( 30) genes, as well as a gene ( 31) encoding a putative
Holin that has four predicted transmembrane domains. The remainder ofthe genome encodes several genes with predicted functions that are ofinterest. TM4 gene 49encodes a putative WhiB-like protein, and it is
noteworthy that WhiB family proteins are found in a variety of themycobacteriophages, including phages of Clusters E, F, and J (see SectionsIII.E, III.F, and III.J). Ryniker and colleagues (2010) showed that TM4 gp49is highly expressed soon after infection and functions as a dominantnegative regulator of the host WhiB2 protein, and when TM4 gp49 is
expressed in M.smegmatis it induces septation inhibition. TM4 gene 69
is not an essential gene for viral propagation ( Rybniker et al., 2010 ) but is
implicated in mediating superinfection exclusion.
TM4 also encodes a large putative Primase/Helicase enzyme (gp70)
and a RusA-like Holliday Junction resolvase (gp71). TM4 gene 79encodes
an SprT-like protease of unknown function, although it is noteworthy that
a number of mycobacteriophages encode proteases of a variety of types inthe nonstructural parts of their genomes; phages in Clusters A, C, and K
also encode SprT-like proteases, Cluster E phages encode a Clp-like
protease, and Cluster I phages encode a predicted peptidase. These aredistinct from proteases encoded as part of the virion structural geneoperon where they play a role in capsid assembly, although a variety ofdifferent types of enzymes appear to perform that function. Presumablythere are protease-required processing events involved outside of capsidassembly, but these remain poorly understood. At least 3 to 4 kbp of theTM4 genome must be nonessential for growth because a variety of shuttle
phasmids have been constructed in which parts of the genome areMycobacteriophages 229

Author's personal copyreplaced by a cosmid vector ( Bardarov et al., 1997 ;Jacobs et al., 1987, 1989 ).
The extent of the deleted regions is not yet clear but is within the right half
of the genome.
The two Subcluster K1 phages, Angelica and CrimD, are quite similar
to each other and both are rather different from TM4 at the nucleotidesequence level ( Pope et al., 2011 ). Nonetheless, many of the genes are
homologues when compared at the amino acid level, especially in thevirion structure and assembly operons. A notable difference though isthat Cluster K1 genomes are approximately 7 kbp larger than TM4(Table I ); this difference is largely accounted for by a large insertion in
the middle of K1 genomes relative to TM4. It thus seems likely that TM4
acquired a large central deletion, possibly during its time of isolation, a
scenario reminiscent of the properties of some of the Cluster A phages,such as D29 (see Section III.A). Unfortunately, K1 and K2 genomes areinsufficiently similar at the nucleotide level to determine precisely howsuch a deletion might have occurred. The central segment of K1 phagegenomes encodes an integrase and a plausible transcriptional regulator,consistent with the idea that the nontemperate behavior of TM4 arises as aconsequence of this deletion. Putative attP sites are located adjacent to
their integrase genes, and Angelica and CrimD are predicted to integrateat an attB site overlapping the host tmRNA gene (see Section V.B.1 and
Table II). These are the only mycobacteriophages known to use thisintegration site ( attB-9 ,Table II) and all others that encode a tyrosine-
integrase integrate into known host tRNA genes (see Section V.B.1 andTable II). We also note that both Angelica and CrimD encode a tRNA
trp
gene (gene 5) located between the terminase large subunit gene ( 8) and
the left physical end. This tRNA gene is similar to tRNAtrpgenes encoded
by L5 and D29 (95% identity across 59 of the 75 bp; see Section III.A) aswell as the M.smegmatis mc
2155 host tRNA gene (Msmeg_1343, 90% over
73 bp) and presumably could have been acquired from either a phage or ahost genome. Derivatives of TM4 are perhaps the most widely usedmycobacteriophages in mycobacterial genetics because of their ability toinfect both fast- and slow-growing mycobacteria and the availability ofTM4 shuttle phasmids that can be manipulated readily ( Jacobs et al.,
1987). Shuttle phasmids are chimeras containing a mycobacteriophage
moiety and an E.colicosmid moiety, such that they can be propagated
as large plasmids in E.coliand as phages in mycobacteria ( Jacobs et al.,
1987, 1991 ). Construction of shuttle phasmids involves a step in which
these chimeras are packaged into phage lheads in vitro (Jacobs et al.,
1991) and thus it is not surprising that TM4 shuttle phasmids contain
deletions of phage DNA such as to accommodate the cosmid vectorinsertion. TM4 shuttle phasmids can be manipulated readily using stan-dard genetic and molecular biology approaches in E.coliand have been
exploited for the delivery of transposons ( Bardarov et al., 1997 ), reporterMycobacteriophages 231
Author's personal copygenes ( Jacobs et al., 1993 ), and allelic exchange substrates ( Bardarov et al.,

L. Cluster L
Cluster L contains just a single published phage genome, LeBron; how-
ever, six additional unpublished phages also fall within Cluster L. LeBronis anticipated to be competent to form lysogens and encodes its own
tyrosine-integrase ( Pope et al., 2011 ). It is relatively recently isolated and
little is known about its general biological properties. A map of the
LeBron genome organization is shown in Figure 15 .
A LeBron gene encoding a terminase large subunit ( 4) is located
approximately 1.0 kbp from the physical left end of the genome, andthere are three small open reading frames predicted in the interveningregion. One of these ( 2) is a candidate for encoding a terminase small
subunit, and has sequence similarity to a gene immediately upstream of
the terminase large subunit gene in Omega ( Fig. 13 ). Within the putative
virion structure and assembly operon ( 2–24) genes encoding a terminase
large subunit ( 4), portal ( 5), protease ( 6), capsid ( 7), major tail subunit ( 13),
tail assembly chaperones ( 14and15), tapemeasure protein, and minor tail
proteins ( 17–24) are predicted. The lysis cassette follows this and includes
both lysin A ( 25) and lysin B ( 26) genes and the putative holin gene 27.T o
the right there are short leftward-transcribed operons, including a tyro-
sine-integrase gene, followed by a longer rightward-transcribed operon
that includes several genes implicated in regulation and nucleotide or
DNA metabolism. These include a putative WhiB regulator (gp78), akinase (gp74), a ssDNA-binding protein (gp81), an RNA ligase (gp65), aputative DNA Pol II (gp93), EndoVII (gp96) and RusA (gp76) HollidayJunction resolvases, a DnaB-like helicase, a ribosephosphate kinase(gp71), and an Erf-like general recombinase (gp60). The kinase may actwith the RNA Ligase to evade an RNA-damaging host response as pro-posed to Cjw1 and Omega ( Zhu et al., 2004 ). Two additional genes encode
a putative esterase (gp46) of unknown specificity and a nicotinate phos-phoribosyltransferase (gp72). The rightmost 10 kbp of the LeBron genomecontains mostly leftward-transcribed genes of unknown function, withthe exception of gene 128that encodes an AAA-ATPase protein. About
80% of LeBron genes remain of unknown function. LeBron also encodesnine tRNA genes (tRNA
leu,t R N Athr, tRNAlys, tRNAtyr,t R N Atrp, tRNAleu,
tRNAhis, tRNAcys, and tRNAlys) of unknown function, but we note that
while most of these correspond to codons used highly in the LeBron
genome (see Section III.A), one of them (tRNAleu) has an anticodon
corresponding to the rare codon 50-CUA. Overall, LeBron is an interesting
genome with numerous genes, suggesting an intriguing but poorly
understood biology.232 Graham F. Hatfull

1. Corndog
The singleton phage Corndog has an unusual morphology with a prolate
head having approximately a 4:1 length-to-width ratio. It looks like acorndog! Corndog forms plaques on M.smegmatis that are neither
completely clear nor turbid, and stable lysogens have not been reported.Corndog does not infect M.tuberculosis. A map of the Corndog genome
organization is shown in Figure 16 .
Corndog contains a 69.8-kbp genome with defined cohesive ends,
having 4-base ssDNA extensions as described earlier for Omega (see
Section III.J). However, the putative terminase large subunit gene ( 32)i s
located /C2413.5 kbp away and there are 31 predicted genes between it and
the left physical end. Most of these 31 genes are of unknown function and
the majority are orphams. However, genes 6and 7have regions asso-
ciated with DNA methylases, gene 11encodes an Endo VII Holiday
Junction resolvase, gene 22encodes a primase/polymerase, and gene 29
has an HNH domain. Gene 25is part of a truncated copy of an MPME1
mobile element ( Sampson et al., 2009 )(see Fig. 10 B). Genes 1–12are
organized into an apparent leftward-transcribed operon, whereas genes13–31are transcribed rightward and could be part of the viral structure
and assembly operon that continues to the right.
The Corndog virion structure and assembly genes ( 32–67)c o n t a i n i n g
genes encoding the terminase large subunit ( 32), portal ( 34), protease ( 39),
capsid ( 41), major tail subunit ( 49), tail assembly chaperones expressed via
a programmed translational frameshift ( 54and 55), tapemeasure protein
(57), and minor tail proteins ( 58-67) can be predicted confidently. Although
these genes appear in the canonical order, their synteny is disrupted in atleast five locations. Two of these involve HNH insertions (genes 33and56)
and one ( 40) is a single small gene inserted between the putative protease
and capsid genes that does not appear similar to scaffold proteins ( Fig. 16 ).
A fourth is between the putative major tail subunit gene and the tailassembly chaperones and contains four small open reading frames, oneof which ( 51) has homologues in some Cluster C phages. Another of these
(53) is a predicted transcriptional regulator. The fifth syntenic interruption
is between the putative portal protein and the protease ( Fig
 . 16). Four open
reading frames are present (genes 35–38), and three of them ( 35,37,a n d 38)
are predicted to encode an O-methytransferase, a polypeptide N-acetylga-
lactose aminyltransferase, and a glycosyltransferase, respectively. Theseare similar functions to genes located within the virion structure andassembly operon of Omega ( Fig. 13 ), except that in Omega they are
inserted between the capsid and major tail subunit genes. It is not knownif these enzymes are responsible for modification of virions, although this
is an intriguing possibility that warrants investigation.234
Graham F. Hatfull
Author's personal copyFIGURE 16 Map of the singleton phage Corndog genome. See Figure 3 A for further details on genome map presentation.
Author's personal copySequences of the virion structure genes provide few clues to the
unusual Corndog prolate head morphology. The putative capsid subunit
(gp41) is not closely related to any other mycobacteriophage-encoded
proteins, and its closest homologue is a gene within the Bifidobacterium
dentium genome, although the two proteins are only 26% identical. It does,
however, contain a predicted capsid domain and HHPred reports simi-
larity to the HK97 capsid structure. We note that the Corndog capsidsubunit sequence has no evident sequence similarity with the capsidsubunits of Cluster I phages, which also have prolate heads but with adifferent length:width ratio (see Section III.I).
The lysis cassette lies to the right of the virion structure and assembly
operon and contains lysin A ( 69) and lysin B ( 70) genes, as well as a
putative holin ( 71). To the right of that is a long leftward-transcribed
operon ( 76–121) amazingly enriched for orphams (only 7 of the 57 genes
have evidently related genes in other mycobacteriophages), althoughseveral genes in this operon have interesting predicted functions(Fig. 16 ). First, Corndog gene 87encodes a Ku-like protein distantly
related to both the M.smegmatis homologue (Msmeg_5580; 35% amino
acid sequence identity) and the Ku-like gp206 protein encoded in phage
Omega (32% amino acid sequence identity) ( Pitcher et al., 2006 ). Both
Corndog and Omega share the features of having cohesive genome ter-
mini with 4-base extensions and encoding Ku-like proteins, supportingthe idea that Ku-like proteins play a role in NHEJ-mediated genomecircularization upon infection (see Sections III.J and VI.B). Second, Corn-dog gene 82encodes a putative DNA polymerase III bsubunit implicated
in acting as a loading clamp in DNA replication. It is unclear whether thisgene is required for Corndog replication and what role it could play.
However, this is the only occurrence of this particular function in any of
the mycobacteriophage genomes. It is not obvious that it was acquiredrecently from a bacterial host, in that its closest relative is the clamp loaderofSaccharopolyspora erythraea and the proteins share only 23% amino acid
sequence identity. There are no other closely related phage-encodedhomologues. A third gene of interest is Corndog 96encoding an AAA-
ATPase, although it is not closely related to other AAA-ATPases encodedby other mycobacteriophages (such as LeBron gp128, Myrna gp262, or
Che8 gp69). Its origins are also unclear, and the closest homologue is a
protein encoded by Haliangium ochraceum , which shares 33% amino acid
sequence identity. There are no closely related homologues in other phagegenomes.
Finally, Corndog gp90 is a ParB-like protein implicated in chromo-
some partitioning. A plausible role for such a function could be to providestability to an extrachromosomally replicating Corndog prophage,although because lysogens have not yet been recovered, this is unclear.
An alternative possibility is that this protein plays a different role such as236
Graham F. Hatfull
Author's personal copya regulatory function rather than partitioning per se. We note in this
regard that there is no putative ParA protein, a striking difference fromthe putative partitioning functions in RedRock (see Fig. 3 B and Section
III.A). There is no obvious homologue of Corndog gp90 in M. smegmatis ,
but there are related genes in other mycobacterial strains and otherActinomycetales genomes, with the closest homologue being Mycobacte-
rium kansasii Spo0J (46% amino acid sequence identity).
2. Giles
The singleton Giles forms lightly turbid plaques on M.smegmatis from
which stable lysogens can be recovered ( Morris et al., 2008 ). Giles does not
infect M.tuberculosis. A map showing Giles genome organization is
shown in Figure 17 . The genome has defined cohesive termini with long
(14-base) single-stranded DNA extensions. Like other singleton genomes,Giles contains a high proportion of orphams and only 14 of the predicted78 genes have readily identifiable homologues in other mycobacterio-
phages ( Fig. 17 ). Giles gene 1corresponds to a possible terminase small
subunit gene, but is separated by three short open reading frames on the
opposite strand from the terminase large subunit gene ( Fig. 17 ). The
putative virion structure and assembly operon extends from gene 1to
gene 36and has several striking features. First, most of these are orphams,
reflecting the considerable sequence divergence from other mycobacter-iophages. Genes encoding the terminase large subunit ( 5), portal ( 6),
protease ( 7), capsid ( 9), tail assembly chaperones expressed via a pro-
grammed frameshift ( 17and 18), tapemeasure ( 19), and minor tail pro-
teins ( 21–28,36) can be identified readily ( Fig. 17 ). Gene 8may encode a
scaffold-like protein, based on its position in the operon, but no major tailsubunit gene can be predicted confidently. Second, the lysis cassette liesupstream of gene 36, which has been shown experimentally to be a virion-
associated protein, and thus the lysis cassette—including lysin A ( 31),
lysin B ( 32), and putative holin genes ( 33)—appears to lie within this
operon ( Morris et al., 2008 ). In most other mycobacteriophages genomes
(with the notable exception of Cluster A phages), it is noteworthy that thelocation of the lysis cassette is immediately downstream of the virionstructure and assembly operon, and because the virion proteins havebeen characterized experimentally for few of these phages, it is plausiblethat they may also have genes downstream of the lysis cassette thatencode virion proteins; it is also plausible that Giles gene 36was acquired
relatively recently, and we note that other mycobacteriophage genomescontain tail genes in noncanonical positions [e.g., L5 gene 6;(Hatfull and
Sarkis, 1993 )]. A more curious feature of this part of the Giles genome is
the presence of the integration cassette—including integrase andxisgenes,
as well as attP—between the minor tail subunit genes and the lysis
cassette ( Morris et al., 2008 ). It is plausible that this cassette relocated toMycobacteriophages 237

Author's personal copythis position by an errant recombination event encoded by the integrase
protein ( Morris et al., 2008 ). To the right of the virion structure and
assembly operon there is one leftward-transcribed operon and one to
the right. The leftward operon contains genes 38–48, all of which are of
unknown function. The rightward operon contains genes 49–78and
although the vast majority of these are orphams and have no known
function, several do have potential functions of interest. For example,genes 52and 53encode putative exonuclease and RecT proteins, respec-
tively, and presumably mediate homologous recombination events; this issupported experimentally ( van Kessel and Hatfull, 2008a ). Gene 61
encodes a DnaQ-like enzyme, a common function among many mycobac-
teriophage genomes, although the diversity of the encoded proteins is
very high, and the closest homologue of Giles gp61 is a related geneencoded by Kineococcus radiotolerans (30% amino acid sequence identity).
Gene 62encodes a putative DNA methylase, although its function is
unclear; DNA methylases can be components of restriction–modificationsystems, although if this were the case in Giles, it is unclear which genemight encode the putative restriction function. Gene 67encodes a RuvC-
like Holliday Junction resolvase, extending this as one of the most com-
mon functions encoded by mycobacteriophage genomes, albeit through
the use of different classes of genes (i.e., RuvA, RusA, EndoVII ); gene 68
encodes a WhiB-like gene regulator.
Although it was reported initially that the Giles genome was 54,512 bp
in length ( Morris et al., 2008 ), this includes a segment at the extreme right
end that was included due to an assembly error. Correction of thesequence generates a 53,746 bp genome, and the putative metE -like gene
reported as Giles gene 79is not actually part of the Giles genome ( Hatfull
et al., 2010 ).
3. Wildcat
The singleton Wildcat forms plaques on M.smegmatis that are not evi-
dently turbid, but not completely clear, and stable lysogens have not been
reported. There is also no evidence for prophage stabilization functions in
the genome, such as integrase or partitioning functions, nor are there anyobvious candidates for a phage repressor. It does not infect M.tuberculosis .
The genome is 78.3 kbp in length and contains defined cohesive terminiwith 11-base 3
0ssDNA extensions ( Table I ). A map of the Wildcat genome
organization is shown in Figure 18 . As with other singleton phages (and
Clusters J and L for which only a single published genome is discussedhere), there is a very high proportion (84%) of orphams.
Wildcat gene 26encodes the putative terminase large subunit and is
located over 8 kbp away from the physical left end of the genome.Immediately to its left are two other rightward-transcribed genes(24and 25) of unknown function, although one of these could plausiblyMycobacteriophages 239
Author's personal copyFIGURE 18 Map of the singleton phage Wildcat genome. See Figure 3 A for further details on genome map presentation.
Author's personal copyencode a terminase small subunit. Between the left end and gene 24is a
leftward-transcribed operon (genes 1–23) containing mostly genes of
unknown function. The presence of ‘‘additional’’ genes in this part of
the genome (it is more typical for terminase genes to be close to their sites
of action, i.e., near the genome end) extends a theme observed in thegenomes of Clusters A, B, D, and Corndog. Three of these genes can beassigned putative functions. Gene 13encodes a putative LexA-like tran-
scriptional regulator, and gene 11encodes a putative O-methyltransfer-
ase, a function seen in other genomes, including Omega and Corndog,although Wildcat gene 11is quite different in sequence to these. Wildcat
gene 8encodes putative tRNA adenyltransferase activity, presumably
involved in CCA addition to tRNAs ( Fig. 18 ). The only other mycobacter-
iophage with a similar function is Myrna (gp28), although it shares nomore similarity to Myrna gp28 ( /C2435% amino acid identity) than it does to
host PncA proteins. Both Wildcat and Myrna encode a large number oftRNAs, which may belie the requirement to encode this function,although we note that Cluster C1 phages also encode a large number oftRNAs but appear to lack such an activity.
The virion structure and assembly operon (genes 26–45) is fairly canon-
ical with uninterrupted synteny, and genes encoding putative terminaselarge subunit ( 26), portal ( 27), capsid ( 30), major tail subunit ( 35), tail
assembly chaperone expressed via a programmed translational frameshift(36and 37), tapemeasure ( 38), and minor tail proteins ( 39–45) can be
predicted with confidence; gene 28is a distant relative of LeBron gene 6
and likely encodes a protease, and gene 29—a distant relative of LeBron
gene 7—is a strong candidate for encoding a scaffold protein in light of its
location within the operon ( Fig. 18 ). Wildcat gp44 has putative
D-alanyl- D-
alanine carboxypeptidase activity common to that of b-lactamase
enzymes, which is commonly encoded by genes located among other tailgenes, as in Subcluster A1, Clusters C, D, E, J, and singleton Corndog. Therole of these putative proteins is unknown, but they presumably areinvolved in either cell wall binding or facilitating receptor recognition(see Section VI.A). The lysis cassette lies to the right of the virion structureand assembly operon and includes lysin A ( 49) and lysin B ( 52) genes and a
putative holin gene ( 51) located between them. Immediately to the right of
the lysis cassette is a small gene encoding a putative NrdH-like glutare-doxin. The role for such a redoxin is unknown, but genes with relatedfunctions are found in a number of other mycobacteriophages and thereare many examples of them located in a similar position, just downstreamof the lysis cassette. Examples are found in Cjw1, Omega, and LeBron, butin Cluster A and K phages it is encoded elsewhere in the genome. To theright of the lysis cassette are three apparent operons: two transcribedleftward (genes 54–59; genes 143–172) flanking a rightward operon
(genes 60–142). The two leftward-transcribed operons are virtually devoidMycobacteriophages 241
Author's personal copyof any genes with predicted functions, the exception being gene 58encod-
ing a putative nucleotyltransferase. Only three of this entire repertoire of
genes ( 160,164, and 170) have homologues in other mycobacteriophages.
The rightward operon contains several genes of interest, including theputative recombinase Erf (gene 64), a Clp protease (gene 68), SSB (gene
78), a DnaB-like helicase (gene 80), a WhiB-like regulator (gene 86), two
DnaQ-like but distantly related proteins (encoded by genes 92and136), a
putative PTPc-like phosphatase (gene 96), and a putative phosphoesterase
of unknown specificity (gene 137).
This operon also contains an impressive array of tRNA genes (23 in
total), as well as a tmRNA gene. Although several proposals have been
presented to explain the potential roles for mycobacteriophage-encoded
tRNAs ( Hassan et al., 2009 ;Kunisawa, 2000 ;Sahu et al., 2004 ), the variety
of their numbers and types in mycobacteriophages is amazing ( Table I ). In
addition to Wildcat, all Cluster C phages also have a large number oftRNA genes, Cluster E phages have two, Subcluster K1 phages have one,just one of the Cluster B phages has one (Nigel), and Subclusters A2 andA3 have between one and five. Thus for some phages it appears advanta-geous to have virtually a complete coding set of tRNA genes, whereas
others appear to require no tRNA genes at all. Wildcat is the only phage
outside of Cluster C that also encodes a tmRNA. It seems plausible thatthe phage-encoded tmRNA may serve to increase the efficiency of releaseof ribosomes from broken or otherwise damaged mRNAs, optimize trans-lation efficiencies by maximizing the size of the pool of available ribo-somes, or monitor protein folding ( Hayes and Keiler, 2010 ). tRNA genes
may also play a general role in enhancing the frequency of translation,although we cannot rule out that at least some of the tRNAs may be
involved in the introduction of noncanonical amino acids into proteins.
In summary, Wildcat is certainly quite a wild phage with numerous
features of interest that deserve a more detailed investigation. As with
other singletons, annotation and interpretation of the genome lacks fromthe insights provided by the availability of more closely related phages.
IV. MYCOBACTERIOPHAGE EVOLUTION: HOW DID THEY
GET TO BE THE WAY THEY ARE?
The collection of sequenced mycobacteriophage genomes —with its clus-ters of closely related phages, as well as those that are distantly related—provides abundant insights into their evolution, and viral evolution in
general. The most prominent feature of their genomic architectures is that
they are mosaic, that is, that the structure of each genome can be explainedas being constructed from a set of modules that are being exchangedamong the phage population ( Hatfull, 2010 ;Hatfull et al., 2006, 2008 ;242
Graham F. Hatfull
Author's personal copyPedulla et al., 2003 ). These modules—composed of either single genes or
larger groups of genes—are thus located in different phage genomes that
are otherwise not closely related. This mosaicism can be seen at two
different levels of comparative genomic analyses. When genomes are
compared at the nucleotide sequence level, relatively recent exchangeevents can be seen, and several examples have been described previously(Hatfull et al., 2010 ;Pope et al., 2011 ). However, the pervasive nature of the
genomic mosaicism is manifested by looking at protein sequence compar-isons because shared gene ancestries can be detected even when they havediverged sufficiently long ago in evolutionary time that nucleotidesequence commonality is no longer evident ( Pedulla et al., 2003 ). Repre-
senting genome mosaicism through a comparison of standard approachessuch as phylogenetic trees is made complicated by the fact that the com-ponent genes may be resident in entirely different genomes ( Hatfull et al.,
2006). An alternative method of representation uses phamily circles in
which each of the genomes in the analysis is placed around the circumfer-ence of a circle and an arc is drawn between those genomes that share agene member of a particular phamily of related genes ( Hatfull et al., 2006 ).
Examples in Figure 19 show phamily circles for five of their eight consec-
utive genes ( 21–28) in the Che9c genome; the remaining three genes are
orphams and thus no related mycobacteriophage genes have yet beenidentified. One of these genes (Che9c 22) has only a single related gene
(forming Pham274), which is located in the Subcluster A3 genome, Bxz2(Fig. 19 ). Che9c gene 24is related to 22 other genes in Pham1628 and is
found in a variety of genomes in Clusters A, F, I, J, and K, but not in Bxz2(Fig. 19 ). Che9c genes 25,26, and 27(members of Phams 1584, Pham1758,
and Pham 1451, respectively) have relationships that are different yet
again. Thus all the individual genes in this region appear to have distinct
evolutionary histories and arrived at their genomic locations throughdifferent evolutionary journeys ( Fig. 19 ). This mosaicism complicates
greatly the task of constructing whole genome phylogenies, as the genomerelationships are fundamentally reticulate in nature ( Lawrence et al., 2002 ;
Lima-Mendez et al., 2007 ).
A hallmark feature of phage genome mosaicism is that in cases where
recombination events can be inferred, they occurred at gene boundaries, or
occasionally at domain boundaries. Usually this is observed where closely
related phage genomes have undergone relatively recent recombinationevents and genome discontinuities can be seen at the nucleotide level(Hatfull, 2008 ;Pope et al., 2011 ). In such cases, it is not uncommon for
sequence discontinuity to appear precisely at or very close to the startand/or stop codons of genes ( Hendrix, 2002 ). This could occur either by a
process of targeted recombination events or as a consequence of functionalselection from a large number of possible exchange events, most of which
generate nonviable progeny and were subsequently lost from theMycobacteriophages 243

described for Fig. 12 . Genes 21,23, and 28are single members of orphams and thus are shown as white boxes. Genes 22and 24–27each have
relatives in other mycobacteriophage genomes; these are represented as phamily circles for the five respective phams. In each phamily circle, all
Author's personal copypopulation ( Hendrix et al., 1999 ). It should be noted that interpreting where
recombination events occur is complicated by the fact that subsequent
rearrangement events could have occurred between the genomes being
compared ( Pedulla et al., 2003 ). In addition, it is impossible to know what
specific recombination events gave rise to the numerous mosaic relation-
ships revealed only through amino acid sequence comparisons.
How does genome mosaicism arise? First it is helpful to note that while
mutational changes involving nucleotide substitutions clearly occur andare an important component of phage evolution, this does not contributedirectly to genome mosaicism, and acquisition of genome segments fromother contexts—either phage or host—by horizontal genetic exchange
offers a more general explanation ( Hendrix et al., 1999, 2000 ). Homologous
recombination between genome segments with extensive sequence simi-
larity also plays an important role in genome evolution in that it cangenerate new combinations of gene content, but does not—with the excep-tion of the process described later—create new gene boundaries that arethe key to juxtaposing one module next to another.
Four known mechanisms are likely to make substantial contributions
to the creation of new module boundaries, although their relative impor-
tance is ill-defined. The first is the process of homologous recombination
events occurring at short conserved sequences at gene boundaries(Susskind and Botstein, 1978 ). This process has been proposed in other
phages ( Clark et al. , 2001 ), and there are a few examples in which this
could have played a role in mycobacteriophage mosaicism ( Pope et al.,
2011). We also note that the 13-bp stoperator sites present in Cluster
A genomes, which are predominantly located near gene boundaries,could be ideal targets for such targeted recombination events (see Sections
III.A and V.A.1). For the most part, however, short conserved boundary
sequences are not obvious at most of the mosaic boundaries that can beidentified ( Pedulla et al., 2003 ). However, most of these are revealed
through amino acid sequence comparisons and occurred long ago inevolutionary time such that any conservation at the boundaries would
80 genomes are represented (in the same order and grouped according to cluster/
subcluster) around the circumference of the circle, and an arc is drawn between those
members of the genomes containing a gene that is a member of that pham. Red and blue
arcs show BlastP and ClustalW comparisons, respectively, and the thickness of the arcreflects strengths of the relationships. The position of Che9c is boxed in each circle. InPham 1451 there are only two relatives present in the Subcluster I1 genomes. In Pham 274,
there is only a single relative that is in the unrelated Subcluster A3 genome, Bxz2. Phams
1628, 1584, and 1758 each have multiple members but distributed among differentclusters and subclusters. This suggests that each of the eight Che9c genes, 21–28,h a v e
arrived in Che9c through distinct evolutionary journeys. This mosaicism is a hallmarkof bacteriophage genomic architectures.Mycobacteriophages 245
Author's personal copyhave been long lost. The second process is site-specific recombination
events in which secondary sites have been used by a site-specific recom-binase to give rise to insertions in atypical locations. Although this is
unlikely to be a predominant process, phages often encode site-specific
recombinases, including both tyrosine- and serine-family integrases. Onenotable example is observed in phage Giles (see Section III.M.2), in whichthe integration cassette is located among the tail genes, and could havemoved there through integrase acting at a secondary site within the virionstructure and assembly operon ( Morris et al., 2008 ). The third process is by
movement of mobile elements such as transposons and other mobileelements such as inteins, homing endonucleases, and introns, generating
both insertions into new genomic locations, and by transposase-mediated
rearrangements such as adjacent deletions and inversions. Transposonsare not common in mycobacteriophages but several have been recog-nized. The strongest evidence is for MPME elements found in Cluster Gand many Cluster F genomes (see Sections III.G and III.F); these areclearly involved in interrupting what are otherwise conserved gene syn-tenies ( Sampson et al., 2009 ). Another example is the putative IS110 family
insertion sequence present in Omega and its distant relative in Bethlehem
(see Sections III.A and III.J). Numerous examples of inteins and HNH-like
homing endonucleases exist throughout genomes, but no mycobacter-iophage introns have been described. The fourth—and probably themost important contributor—is illegitimate or nontargeted recombinationprocesses that occur without requirement for extensive sequence identity(Hendrix, 2003 ;Hendrix et al., 1999 ;Pedulla et al., 2003 ). It is unclear what
mediates such events, although it is noteworthy that bacteriophagescommonly encode their own general recombinases, such as phage lRed
systems, RecET-like systems, and P22 Erf-like systems. Mycobacterio-phages are no exception, and there are now many examples of RecT-likerecombinases (associated with several different types of exonuclease,some of which are related to RecE and some which are not), Erf-likefunctions, and RecA-like proteins. Examples of some of these phage-encoded recombinases are known to mediate recombination over shortersegments of sequence identity than is typically favored by host recombi-nation systems; they can also tolerate substantial differences between
recombining partners ( Martinsohn et al., 2008 ). Although the efficiency
of recombination at ultrashort sequence commonalities (such as codons or
ribosome-binding sites) is expected to occur at very low frequencies, andmultiple events may be required to generate viable progeny, with apotentially long evolutionary history (2 to 3 billion years?) and a highincidence of infection (estimated to be about 10
23infections per second
globally), inefficiency is unlikely to be an impediment to generating theextent of mosaicism seen in the phage population today. It should also be
noted that such illegitimate recombination events are likely to occur more246

times larger, consistent with the common finding of host genes in phagegenomes ( Pedulla et al., 2003 ). There are numerous examples of genes
present within mycobacteriophages that are not typically present inphage genomes, with the queuosine biosynthesis genes in Rosebush (seeFigs. 4 and 5 ) being a good example ( Pedulla et al., 2003 ). Finally, we note
that generating new gene boundaries either by transposition or by illegit-imate recombination is a highly creative process in that DNA sequenceelements can be placed together in combinations that did not exist previ-ously in nature. Although most illegitimate recombination events areexpected to make genomic trash, the process is one of very few that can
create entirely new types of genes.
Comparative genomic analysis of SPO1-like phages led to the sugges-
tions that newly acquired genes are, on average, relatively small ( Stewart
et al., 2009 ), and a similar conclusion arises from a comparison of mycobac-
teriophage genomes ( Hatfull et al., 2010 ). This is consistent with the pre-
dominant role of illegitimate recombination because most events are likely
to occur within reading frames, and thus selection for function is expected todrive toward functional domains rather than multidomain proteins. This
could also account for the reason that phage genes are, on average, only
about two-thirds the average size of host genes ( Hatfull et al., 2010 ).
V. ESTABLISHMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF LYSOGENY
Temperate phages are of particular interest for a variety of reasons. Forexample, they typically employ gene regulatory circuits that can provideinsights into novel systems for gene expression and control, as well asbeing potentially useful for genetic manipulation of the host. Similarly,
phage integration provide insights into mechanisms of site-specific
recombination and how directionality is controlled, as well as providingthe basis for novel plasmid vectors for host genetics ( Hatfull, 2010 ).
Temperate phages also often carry genes expressed from the prophagestate and contribute to lysogenic conversion of the physiological state ofthe host. All of these aspects are applicable to mycobacteriophages, andthe intimacy of phage–host relationships inherent in temperate phages isparticularly intriguing.
A. Repressors and immunity functions
1. Cluster A immunity systems
Genes encoding phage repressors have been identified in remarkably fewmycobacteriophages, and there is no complete understanding of life cycleregulation in any of them. Perhaps the best studied are the immunityMycobacteriophages 247
Author's personal copysystems of mycobacteriophage L5—and its unsequenced but closely
related phage L1 (Subcluster A2)( Leeet al., 1991 )—where the repressor
has been identified and characterized ( Bandhu et al., 2009, 2010 ;Brown
et al., 1997 ;Donnelly-Wu et al., 1993 ;Ganguly et al., 2004, 2006, 2007 ;
Nesbit et al., 1995 ;Sauet al., 2004 )(see Section III.A). A number of other
phages encode related repressors, including other Cluster A members,and the Cluster C phage, LRRHood, and the Cluster F phage, Fruitloop,although they are diverse at the sequence level, and pairwise relation-ships between repressors from different Subclusters in Custer A can bebelow 30% amino acid sequence identity. The Subcluster A1 phage Bxb1repressor is the only other one that has been analyzed in any detail ( Jain
and Hatfull, 2000 ).
The L5 repressor (gp71) is a 183 residue protein containing a strongly
predicted helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif and was identifiedthrough two key observations. First, when the repressor gene is expressedin the absence of any other phage-encoded functions it confers immunityto superinfection by L5. Second, mutations in the repressor confer a clearplaque phenotype; point mutations in the repressor gene can lead to atemperature-sensitive clear-plaque phenotype and lysogens that are ther-
moinducible ( Donnelly-Wu et al., 1993 ). Unlike most other well-studied
repressors, it is predominantly a monomer in solution and recognizes an
asymmetric sequence in DNA ( Bandhu et al., 2010 ;Brown et al., 1997 ).
A primary target of regulation is the early lytic promoter P
left, which is
situated at the right end of the genome and transcribed leftward ( Fig. 3 A).
The L5 P leftpromoter is highly active and contains /C010 and /C035 sequences
corresponding closely to the consensus sequences for E.colisigma-70
promoters ( Nesbit et al., 1995 ). There are two 13-bp repressor-binding
sites at P left, one of which (site 1) overlaps the /C035 sequence and the
other (site 2) is located /C24100 bp downstream within the transcribed
region. L5 gp71 binds to these two sites independently, and binding tosite 2 does not substantially influence repression of P
left; when gene 71is
provided on an extrachromosomal plasmid, P leftis downregulated about
50-fold ( Brown et al., 1997 ) through repressor binding to site 1. The
binding affinity of gp71 for site 1 is modest, with a Kdof about 5 /C210-8
M, and binding to site 2 is about 5- to 10-fold weaker ( Brown et al., 1997 ).
Interestingly, repression by binding at site 1 may not be mediated bypromoter occlusion, but rather by RNA polymerase retention at thepromoter. This is indicated by the observation that phage mutants canbe isolated [designated as class III ( Donnelly-Wu et al., 1993 )] that have
mutations within the repressor gene but have a dominant-negative phe-notype, being competent to infect a repressor-expressing strain. Suchgp71 variants could thus bind to site I without retaining RNA polymeraseand prevent that action of wild-type gp71. A surprising observation was
that the L5 genome contains a large number of potential repressor-binding248
Graham F. Hatfull
Author's personal copysites located throughout the genome (see Section III.A). Initially, a total
of 30 putative sites were identified, 24 of which (including sites 1and 2) were shown biochemically to be bound by gp71 ( Brown et al.,
1997). These sites conform to the asymmetric consensus sequence
5
0-GGTGGMTGTCAAG (M is either A or C), where eight of the positions
are absolutely conserved and three others contain only a single departurefrom the consensus ( Brown et al., 1997 ); roles for the six nonbinding sites
cannot be ruled out, as weaker gp71 association may be biologicallyrelevant. Sites are not positioned randomly in the genome but have twoimportant features in common. First, they are oriented in predominantlyjust one direction relative to the direction of transcription. Thus of the five
sites located within the left arm (between the physical left end and the
integrase gene; Fig. 3 ), four (sites 20–23) within the predicted rightward-
transcribed region (genes 1–32) are oriented in the ‘‘ /C0’’ direction; the
other (site 24, located between the physical left ends and gene 1) is inthe ‘‘þ’’ orientation ( Brown et al., 1997 ). It is not known if this segment is
transcribed or not. In the right arm (between the integrase gene and thephysical right end, Fig. 3A), all of the sites in the leftward-transcribed
region (genes 23–88) are oriented in the ‘‘ þ’’ orientation. Second, sites are
typically located within short intergenic intervals, often overlapping theputative start and stop codons of adjacent genes. When one or more ofthese binding sites is inserted between a heterologous promoter (hsp60)and a reporter gene ( FFLux ), binding of gp71 has a polar effect on gene
expression. This effect is repressor dependent, is strongly influenced byorientation of the site relative to transcription, and is amplified by thepresence of multiple sites ( Brown et al., 1997 ). Because repressor binding
appears to prevent transcription elongation rather than initiation, these
sites (other than site 1) are referred to as ‘‘stoperators’’ ( Brown et al., 1997 ).
The mechanism by which this occurs is unknown, but an attractive model
is that the repressor interacts directly with RNA polymerase and perhapsretains it at the stoperator site, consistent with the model for action as arepressor by RNA polymerase retention at site 1. It is postulated that thesesites play a role in silencing the L5 prophage, ensuring that phage genespotentially deleterious to growth of a lysogen are not expressed fromerrant transcription events during lysogeny ( Brown et al., 1997 ). However,
there is not yet any formal demonstration that additional promoters arenot overlapping all or some of these sites or that removal of any of thesesites influences either prophage stability or fitness of L5 lysogens.
The regulation of L5 gene 71is poorly understood, although there is a
set of three putative promoters located upstream in the gene 71–72inter-
genic region that are presumably responsible for gp71 synthesis from aprophage. The reason for three promoters is unclear. Curiously, eventhough these three promoters are downregulated during lytic growth,
evidence shows that the repressor gene is transcribed during early lyticMycobacteriophages 249
Author's personal copygrowth from transcripts arising from P left(Fig. 3)( Nesbit et al., 1995 ).
Presumably, other phage-encoded functions prevent gp71 from acting
during lytic growth, although none have been identified. Another conun-
drum arises because the three promoters upstream of gene 71are active in
a nonlysogen, such that although it is simple to model how lysogeny is
established, it is less easy to imagine how lytic growth ensues afterinfection. Presumably, either the action of gp71 itself is modulated —perhaps either by post-translational modification or by degradation—ora second regulator prevents expression during the establishment of lyticgrowth. Although no additional L5 genes have been specifically identifiedas playing a role in the L5 lytic–lysogenic decision, clear plaque mutants
have been identified with reduced frequencies of lysogeny (similar to cIII
mutants of phage l), and genes located within the region to the right of
gene 71are implicated ( Donnelly-Wu et al., 1993 ;Sarkis et al., 1995 ).
Finally, we note that L5 lysogens are not strongly inducible by DNA-damaging agents, even though this is a common feature of many othertemperate phages. Lysogens do undergo spontaneous induction torelease particles into the supernatant of a liquid culture, but the natureof repressor loss-of-function is not known.
Mycobacteriophage Bxb1 encodes a related repressor (gp69), although
it shares only 41% amino acid identity with L5 gp71 and the two phagesare heteroimmune ( Jain and Hatfull, 2000 ;Mediavilla et al., 2000 ). How-
ever, there are many common features of the two immunity systems,including multiple promoters upstream of the repressor gene [two inBxb1 ( Jain and Hatfull, 2000 )], a repressor-regulated early lytic promoter,
and multiple stoperator sites located throughout the genomes. In Bxb1there are 34 putative 13-bp asymmetric stoperator sites, corresponding to
the consensus 5
0-GTTACGWDTCAAG (W is A or T), with notable differ-
ences from the L5 consensus at positions 1, 4, and 5. Most of these share
the same features of the L5 stoperators in being located within shortintergenic regions and oriented in one direction relative to the directionof transcription. Bxb1 gp69 binds with a similar affinity to its binding siteas L5 gp71 does to its sites, but recognition of each other’s sites occursonly at a much lower affinity ( /C241000-fold lower), accounting for their
heteroimmune phenotype.
Prior to its genomic characterization, mycobacteriophage D29 was
thought to be a substantially different phage than L5 and others, partlybecause it forms completely clear plaques and partly because it infectsM.tuberculosis readily [L5 also infects M.tuberculosis , but has specific
requirements for high calcium concentrations that D29 does not ( Fullner
and Hatfull, 1997 )]. Genomic analysis showed that it is a derivative of a
temperate parent that has suffered a 3.1-kbp deletion removing therepressor and several closely linked genes ( Ford et al., 1998a ). The deletion
event likely occurred relatively recently—perhaps at the time of its250
Graham F. Hatfull
Author's personal copyisolation (see Section III.A)—and D29 is subject to gp71-mediated L5
immunity ( Ford et al., 1998a ). Most of the stoperator sites identified in
L5 are present at similar positions in L5, and the 13-bp consensus
sequence is the same as that of L5.
More recently, the bioinformatic analysis of immunity specificities has
been extended to all of the known Cluster A phages and concludes that
these specificities closely mirror the subcluster divisions. That is, all of thephages within a subcluster form a homoimmune group, but none offersimmunity to phages from other subclusters ( Pope et al., 2011 ). Although
several other Cluster A phages appear to contain defective repressorssuch that stable lysogens cannot be recovered, all contain predicted sto-
perator sites varying in number from 23 in Che12 and Bxz2 to 36 in Jasper
(Pope et al., 2011 ). From all 17 Cluster A phages, a total of 453 potential
sites have been identified, and although only those in L5 and Bxb1 havebeen shown to be true binding sites, some general features are evident. Inparticular, positions 1 and 13 are absolutely conserved (G in both posi-tions) and positions 9 and 12 are highly conserved (T and A, with nine andtwo departures, respectively). Positions 2 through 6 maybe the primarydeterminants of specificity and can likely be discriminated by differences
in the second helix of the HTH motifs of the repressors ( Pope et al., 2011 ),
although this awaits detailed experimental analysis. DNA protection and
mutational analysis of L1 repressor binding are consistent with the bioin-formatic findings ( Bandhu et al., 2010 ).
Mycobacteriophage Fruitloop and LRRHood—members of Clusters F
and C, respectively—both contain genes related to the Cluster A repres-sors, even though stable lysogens have not been reported for either phage.Comparisons of repressor genes show that these are very closely related
to the repressor of Cluster A1 phages ( Fig. 20 ), and LRRHood gp44 has
only a single amino acid departure from Bxb1 gp69 ( Pope et al., 2011 ).
However, neither LRRHood nor Fruitloop contains multiple binding sites
related to the Bxb1 stoperators. There is not a single potential repressor-binding site in the LRRHood genome, and in Fruitloop there is just asingle site located upstream of gene 39that could play a role in autore-
gulation. As discussed previously, the presence of repressor genes inthese phages could have been selected to confer protection to either
lysogens or infected cells from superinfection with Bxb1-like Cluster A1
phages (see Section III.F).
2. Cluster G immunity systems
Putative repressor genes have also been identified in Cluster G phages,
such as BPs and its closely related relatives Halo, Angel, and Hope
(Sampson et al., 2009 ). These phages are temperate, and stable lysogens
can be recovered from infected cells. The BP repressor (gp33) is not closelyrelated to Cluster A-encoded or any other phage repressors but doesMycobacteriophages 251
Author's personal copycontain a putative helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif, and expression of
gp33 confers immunity to superinfection by all of the Cluster G phages(see Section III.G). The repressor gene is located immediately upstream ofthe integrase gene ( 32) and the two genes are predicted to overlap.
A notably unusual feature of genome organization is that the crossover
site for integrative recombination at attP is located within the repressor
gene itself, such that the gene product expressed from the prophage is 33
residues shorter than the virally encoded form. This suggests the possi-bility that integration plays a central regulatory role in the lytic–lysogenicdecision.

Fruitloop repressors are related more closely to those in Cluster A1 (i.e., Bxb1 and its
relatives) than to others.252 Graham F. Hatfull
Author's personal copyB. Integration systems
Phages within Clusters A, E, F, G, I, and K and singletons Giles, Omega,
and LeBron all encode integrases, mostly of the tyrosine-recombinase
family. However, several phages—all within the Cluster A—encode ser-ine-integrases, including all of Subcluster A1, Subcluster A3, and Peachesof Subcluster A4. Although most of the Subcluster A2 phages encodetyrosine-integrases, an interesting exception is RedRock, which encodesputative ParA and ParB proteins at the same genomic location as itsSubcluster A2 relative encode tyrosine-integrases ( Fig. 3 B).
1. Tyrosine-integrase systems
The best studied of mycobacteriophage tyrosine-integrases is thatencoded by L5. L5 integrase is a distant relative of the phage lprototype,
but shares many central features. For example, L5 gpInt (gp33) containstwo DNA-binding specificities: one encoded in a small (65 residue)
N-terminal domain that binds to arm-type sites in attP and a second
within the larger C-terminal domain that recognizes core-type sequences
inattP and attB (Pen˜aet al. , 1997 ). Amino acid residues critical for the
chemistry of strand exchange, including catalytic tyrosine, are all wellconserved. In the L5 genome, the attP site is located to the 5
0side of the
integrase gene and is /C24250 bp long, containing core-type integrase-
binding sites flanked by arm-type integrase-binding sites ( Pen˜aet al.,
1997); the attB site overlaps a tRNAglygene in the M.smegmatis genome
(Lee and Hatfull, 1993 ;Leeet al., 1991 ). L5 integrase-mediated integrative
recombination requires L5 gpInt, a host-encoded mycobacterial integra-tion host factor (mIHF), and attP and attB DNAs ( Lee and Hatfull, 1993 ;
Pedulla et al., 1996 ). DNA supercoiling stimulates recombination in vitro ,
but this is observed if either of the DNA molecules is supercoiled ( Pen˜a
et al., 1998 ). The host factor mIHF is quite distinct from other IHF-like
proteins, and its name reflects its function rather than any sequence orstructural similarity ( Pedulla et al., 1996 ). It contains a single subunit with
DNA -binding properties, is an essential gene in M.smegmatis (Pedulla
and Hatfull, 1998 ), but does not appear to bind either attPorattBwith any
specificity. Nonetheless, it strongly promotes the formation of stabletertiary complexes containing gpInt, mIHF, and attP DNA ( Pedulla
et al., 1996 ). Interestingly, there appear to be alternative pathways for
the assembly of synaptic complexes ( Pen˜aet al., 2000 ) containing attB,
and within which strand exchange occurs. Cleavage occurs seven basesapart within the core region to generate 5
0extensions, and cleavage is
associated with covalent linkage of gpInt to the 30ends of the DNA ( Pen˜a
et al., 1996 ); the 7-bp overlap region corresponds to the anticodon loop of
the tRNAglygene at attB. The directionality of L5 integrase-mediated
recombination is determined by recombination directionality factorMycobacteriophages 253
Author's personal copygp36 (gpXis)( Lewis and Hatfull, 2000 ). L5 gp36 is small (56 residues) and
binds to four putative-binding sites in attP and attR (Lewis and Hatfull,
2003). L5 gp36 is proposed to impart a substantial DNA bend at these sites
and thus dictates the ability of integrase to form recombinagenic protein–
DNA complexes ( Lewis and Hatfull, 2003 ). When bound to attR it pro-
motes formation of a complex in which gpInt is bound simultaneously tothe core and arm-type sites in attR to form an intasome that can synapse
with at attL–intasome ( Lewis and Hatfull, 2003 ). L5 gp36 thus strongly
stimulates excisive recombination. In contrast, when L5 gp36 is bound toattPDNA, it discourages formation of an intasome-like structure that can
synapse with attBDNA, which inhibits integrative recombination ( Lewis
and Hatfull, 2003 ).
2. Serine-integrase systems
Serine-integrases are unrelated to tyrosine-integrases and typically con-tain an N-terminal domain of 140–150 residues related to the catalytic
domain of transposon resolvases such as Tn 3and gdand a large
C-terminal domain with DNA-binding activity ( Smith and Thorpe,
2002). The best-studied of the mycobacteriophage-encoded systems is
that of Bxb1, although the related system encoded by the prophage-like
element, fRv1, has also been investigated. Bxb1 gpInt (gp35) is a 500
residue two-domain protein that catalyzes site-specific recombinationbetween an attP site located to the 5
0side of the gene 35and an attB site
located with the M.smegmatis groEL1 gene ( Kim et al., 2003 ). Both attPand
attB are small, and the minimally required sites contain 48 and 38 bp,
respectively ( Ghosh et al., 2003 ). Strand exchange occurs at the centers of
these sites, and Bxb1 gpInt cleaves to generate two-base 30extensions;
strand exchange involves the formation of gpInt–DNA covalent linkageswith the serine at position 10 linked to the 5
0ends of the DNA ( Ghosh
et al., 2003 ). Bxb1 gp35 efficiently mediates site-specific recombination
between attPandattB in vitro to generate attLandattR, and no additional
proteins are required ( Ghosh et al., 2003 ;Kim et al., 2003 ). The reaction is
not stimulated significantly by DNA supercoiling and does not requirethe addition of either metal ions or high-energy cofactors ( Ghosh et al.,
2003). This reaction is strongly directional, and Bxb1 gpInt alone does not
catalyze recombination between attL and attR; it also fails to catalyze
recombination between any pair of sites other than between attP and
attB. The simplicity of this reaction greatly facilitates biochemical dissec-
tion of the reaction, with the origins of the site specificity and the controlof directionality as central questions of interest.
Both attPand attB are quasi-symmetric in nature, being composed of
imperfectly inverted repeats flanking the 5
0-GT central dinucleotide, and
gpInt binds to each site as a dimer ( Ghosh et al., 2005 ). However, the P and
P’ half sites in attPare distinctly different from the B and B’ attBhalf-sites,
although all four half-sites contain a 50ACNAC motif in symmetrically254 Graham F. Hatfull
Author's personal copyrelated positions ( Ghosh et al., 2003 ). These structures raise several inter-
esting questions. First is the issue as to whether gpInt contains a single
DNA recognition motif that somehow adapts to interact with the two
different types of half-sites or whether there are two separate structural
motifs, each capable of recognizing either B-type or B-type half-sites. Thusfar there is no evidence for more than one type of DNA recognition motif,and the only mutants that discriminate between binding to attPandattB
have substitutions in the putative linker region that joins the two domains(Ghosh et al., 2005 ). A second issue is in regard to the relative orientation of
synapsis, as each site is quasi-symmetrical, and presumably synapsis ismediated by protein–protein interactions between gpInt dimers bound to
attP and attB. Interestingly, synapsis does indeed appear to occur in an
orientation-independent manner, and it is only the asymmetric 5
0-GT
central dinucleotide that determines the orientation of integration
(Ghosh et al., 2003 ). Thus wild-type attP and attB sites can synapse in
both possible orientations (these are referred to as parallel and antiparallelalignments, although the actual configurations are not known) with equalprobabilities. In the productive orientation, one helix can rotate 180
/C14
around the other to generate a recombinant configuration within which
religation to the partner DNA can proceed. In the nonproductive configu-
ration, after 180/C14rotation of the helices, bases at the central dinucleotide
are noncomplementary and ligation does not occur ( Ghosh et al., 2003 ).
However, rotation can proceed for one or more subsequent roundsto realign the central nucleotide bases such that they are in the paren-tal—and thus ligatable—position. Changing a single base in the centraldinucleotide of both attP and attB such that the central nucleotides are
palindromic thus leads to complete loss of orientation specificity, with
approximately equal efficiencies of ligation of the P half-site with B and B’;
likewise for P’ ( Ghosh et al., 2003 ). Site specificity for integrative recombi-
nation likely results from the specificity for synapsis. That is, even thoughintegrase binds as a dimer to all four possible sites, attP,attB,attL, and attR,
synapsis only occurs between gpInt-bound attBand attPcomplexes. The
molecular basis for this is not known, but presumably gpInt adopts differ-ent conformations when bound to the four different sites, such that non-cognate combinations are excluded conformationally. This raises the
question as to how excision occurs, where gpInt bound to attLand attR
must somehow presumably adopt conformations that are productive
(Ghosh et al., 2006 ). Genetic analysis identified a second phage-encoded
protein, gp47, acting as an RDF in that it is required to enable integrase-mediated excisive recombination between attLand attR. Bxb1 gp47 also
inhibits integrative recombination ( Ghosh et al., 2006 ), a common property
of RDF proteins ( Lewis and Hatfull, 2001 ). The molecular mechanism by
which Bxb1 gp47 switches site specificity for gpInt is not known; it does
not bind DNA, but rather associates with gpInt–DNA complexes and
seems to do so differently depending on which type of site is boundMycobacteriophages 255
Author's personal copy(Ghosh et al., 2006 ). This is at least consistent with a model in which gp47
modulates the conformation of gpInt, enabling productive configurations
when it is bound to attLandattR, but not when it is bound to attPandattB.
A notable consequence of the finding that attP and attB are essentially
symmetrical for the purposes of synapsis is that attL and attR, both of
which contain one B-type and one P-type half-site, are essentially identical(Ghosh et al., 2006, 2008 ). This predicts that asymmetry of the central
dinucleotide again plays a critical role in determining productive recom-bination for excision, as gpInt bound to attLis expected to promote synap-
sis just as efficiently with itself as with gpInt bound to attR. This is
confirmed experimentally, because switching the central dinucleotide of
attL to make it palindromic is sufficient to generate an efficient three-
component system requiring just gpInt, gp47, and the mutant attL site
(Ghosh et al., 2008 ). It is also noteworthy that the asymmetry of attLand
attR(each containing one B-type and one P-type half-site) is also reflected
in the orientation of synapsis. Thus in each of the synaptic interactions
observed, an gpInt protomer bound to a B-type half-site must interact withone bound to a P-type half-site ( Ghosh et al., 2008 ).
Bxb1 255 residue gp47 is an unusual RDF and has no sequence similar-
ity to other RDF proteins. It is not closely linked to the integrase gene as isoften observed for RDF’s, but is located approximately 5 kbp to its right,among genes predicted to be involved in DNA replication, including DNApolymerase and DNA primase genes ( Ghosh et al., 2006 ). Strangely, there
are relatives of Bxb1 gp47 in all 17 of the Cluster A phages, including allthose that encode tyrosine-integrases, and indeed in L5 where all thephage-encoded genes required for efficient site-specific recombination—both integrative and excisive—are known (see Sections III.A and V.B.1 and
Fig. 3 B). The simplest interpretation is that Bxb1 gp47 is a dual function
protein, fulfilling a common role of Cluster A phages—most likely in
DNA replication—but also co-opted for use as an RDF in Bxb1. This raisesthe question as to whether homologues of Bxb1 gp47 also perform theRDF function in those phages that encode more distantly related serine-integrases, such as Bxz2 and Peaches (all of the serine-integrase encodedby Subcluster A1 phages are very similar to each other), or whetheralternative proteins have been adopted (see Section III.A).
The serine-integrase system encoded by the M.tuberculosis prophage-
like element fRv1 sheds some light on at least some of the questions raised
by the Bxb1 system ( Bibb et al., 2005 ;Bibb and Hatfull, 2002 ). Like Bxb1,
requirements for integration in vitro are simple, requiring attP and attB
partner DNAs, and fRv1 gpInt ( Bibb and Hatfull, 2002 ). However, the
reaction is somewhat slow and inefficient relative to the Bxb1 reaction.Interestingly, the fRv1 element integrates into a repetitive element in M.
tuberculosis and is therefore found in several different chromosomal loca-
tions. The putative attB sites differ for each of the repeated sequences,
alth
ough four of them are active as sites for recombination ( Bibb and256 Graham F. Hatfull
Author's personal copyHatfull, 2002 ). The RDF protein for the fRv1 system has been identified, and
the 73 residue protein (Rv1584c) is completely unrelated to Bxb1 gp47 ( Bibb
and Hatfull, 2002 ). Yet more surprising, the fRv1 RDF is related to Xis-like
proteins associated with tyrosine-integrases, including L5 gp36 ( Bibb and
Hatfull, 2002 ). While the fRv1 RDF may have DNA-binding activity, this
does not appear to be required for excision, as only the same minimal
sequences are required for excision as they are for integration, all of whichare apparently involved in close interactions with gpInt ( Bibb et al., 2005 ). It
is thus likely that the mechanism of action of the Bxb1 RDF, both in stimu-lating excision and in inhibiting integration, is mediated by direct interac-tions in fRv1 gpInt or gpInt–DNA complexes ( Bibb et al., 2005 ).
3. Integration specificities of mycobacteriophage integrases
For most phages that encode a tyrosine-integrase, a putative attPcore site
can be identified bioinformatically. The basis for this is the observationthat most of these utilize a host tRNA gene for integration, with strand
exchange occurring somewhere within the gene, and the phage genome
carries the 3
0part of the tRNA gene such that a functional gene is recon-
structed following integration. Although recombination itself likely onlyrequires identity between attP and attB at the 7–8 bp constituting the
overlap region between sites of strand cleavage, the requirement fortRNA reconstruction usually extends the sequence identity (or near-identity) to as much as 45 bp, which can be identified readily in a BLASTNsearch. Furthermore, the attP site is typically located near the integrase
gene and is usually in an intergenic noncoding interval. As a result, theseregions can be used to search sequence databases, followed by determi-nation of whether any matching sequences overlap host tRNA genes.Within the phage genome, it is often possible to identify pairs of short(10–11 bp) sequences flanking the attP core that correspond to putative
arm-type integrase-binding sites ( Morris et al., 2008 ). Using this strategy,
putative attB sites can be predicted for most of the mycobacteriophages
that encode tyrosine-integrases ( Table II). For some of these, including L5,
Tweety, BPs, Ms6, and Giles ( Freitas-Vieira et al., 1998 ;Leeet al., 1991 ;
Morris et al., 2008 ;Pham et al., 2007 ;Sampson et al., 2009 ), good experi-
mental evidence supports attB site usage. Others await experimental
verification. However, for Cluster E phages, as well as LeBron, bioinfor-matic identification has proven difficult, and attB site identification will
likely require experimental approaches. One plausible explanation forthis is if they either do not use tRNAs for integration or the positions ofstrand exchange are so close to the 3
0end of a tRNA gene that they are
carrying only a minimal segment of homology to the host genome. Analternative explanation is that these phages do not normally infectM.smegmatis or any closely related strains, and the attB site is simply
not present in M.smegmatis . This would seem unlikely for Cluster E
phages because at least for some, lysogens have been recovered.Mycobacteriophages 257

aTwo phages have been identified that utilize this site but the phage sequences are as yet incomplete and are not yet published.
battB sites have yet to be identified for these phages.
Author's personal copyConfident bioinformatic identification of attB sites for phages encod-
ing serine-integrases is currently not possible. These generally do not
integrate into tRNA genes, and the segment of attP homology to the
host chromosome can be as small as 3 bp ( Smith and Thorpe, 2002 ). The
attBsites for both Bxb1 (which is likely used for all Subcluster A1 phages
because their integrases are extremely similar) and Bxz2 have been iden-tified ( Kim et al., 2003 ;Pham et al., 2007 ). The Bxb1 attB site is located
within the host groEL1 gene, and integration results in inactivation of the
gene with interesting physiological consequences ( Kim et al., 2003 ). Spe-
cifically, Bxb1 lysogens are defective in the formation of mature biofilms,revealing the novel function of GroEL1, which acts as a dedicated chap-
erone for mycolic acid biosynthesis ( Ojha et al., 2005 ). Bxz2 integrates into
the extreme 5
0end of the M.smegmatis gene Msmeg_5156 ( Pham et al.,
2007), although no physiological consequences have been examined. The
attBsite for the more distantly related Peaches has yet to be identified. The
propensity for phages encoding serine-integrases to integrate within host
protein-coding genes with opportunities to influence their physiologymakes this class of mycobacteriophages of particular interest.
In total, 13 distinct attBsites have been identified or predicted ( Table II ).
To facilitate discussion of these attBsites, we have designated them attB1 –
attB13 ,w i t h attB1 denoting the L5 site. The others are ordered according to
their location in the M.smegmatis genome, proceeding in a clockwise direc-
tion ( Fig. 21 ). Related sites for 9 of these are also present in M.tuberculosis ;
these are numbered according to the same designations ( Table II ). The
placement of these on a circular representation of the M. tuberculosis genome
illustrates the lack of synteny between these two strains of mycobacteria(Fig. 21 ). Distribution of attBsites is of interest in part because of the utility
of using phage integrase-based integration-proficient plasmid vectors,which have the advantage of constructing single-copy recombinants thatare genetically stable in the absence of selection (see Section VII.A.1). Whileadditional attBspecificities would likely be welcome, the current distribu-
tion of sites enables the potential use of integration-proficient vectors tointroduce genetic elements of choice at different locations relative to thechromosomal origin of DNA replication.
VI. MYCOBACTERIOPHAGE FUNCTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH
LYTIC GROWTH
A. Adsorption and DNA injection
Unfortunately, rather little is known about the repertoire of bacterialsurface molecules used by mycobacteriophages to specifically recognizetheir hosts. A M.smegmatis peptidoglycolipid, mycoside C(sm), has been260

mycobacteriophage genomes containing integrase genes and for which attP and attB sites can be predicted or are identified experimentally
are shown on a circular representation of the M. smegmatis genome. Those attB sites that are also present in M. tuberculosis H37Rv are shown on
a circular representation of the M. tuberculosis H37Rv genome on the right. The attB designation is conserved between the two strains, such that
for example attB-4 has the same sequence in both strains, notwithstanding the different chromosomal position. All attB sites and their specific
locations are listed in Table II .
Author's personal copypurified and proposed to play a role in binding of the uncharacterized
phage D4 ( Furuchi and Tokunaga, 1972 ), and a set of lyxose-containing
molecules have been proposed as receptors for the uncharacterized phage
Phlei ( Bisso et al., 1976 ;Khoo et al., 1996 ). In addition, a single methylated
rhamnose residue on the cell wall-associated glycopeptidolipid has been
implicated in the adsorption of phage I3 to M.smegmatis (Chen et al.,
2009). No protein-based receptors for mycobacteriophages have been
reported.
Overexpression of a single M.smegmatis protein, Mpr, is sufficient to
confer high levels of resistance to phage D29 ( Barsom and Hatfull, 1996 ),
which may occur through placement of the gene on an extrachromosomal
plasmid ( Barsom and Hatfull, 1996 ), expressing it from a strong promoter
(Barsom and Hatfull, 1996 ), or through activation by adjacent transposon
insertion ( Rubin et al., 1999 ). It is plausible that spontaneous D29 resis-
tance could occur by localized genome amplification of the mprlocus that
is genetically unstable and recombines back to a single copy in the
absence of selection. The cellular role of Mpr is not known and is notpresent in M.tuberculosis . Interestingly, the 215 residue Mpr protein
contains a 125 reside domain at its extreme C-terminus belonging to the
Telomeric repeat-binding factor 2 (TRF2) superfamily implicated in rec-
ognition and binding to TTAGGG-like telomeric repeats. This is an unex-pected function for a bacterium that does not contain a linear genome,although it is of interest because of the observation that overexpression ofMpr appears to specifically inhibit injection of D29 DNA. Perhaps thisgene has been acquired specifically to prevent phage infection undercertain circumstances.
Presumably, specific recognition of the bacterial host is accomplished
through structures encoded at the tips of phage tails. Genomic analysisshows that those phages with a siphoviral morphotype encode five toeight putative minor tail protein genes downstream of the tapemeasureprotein gene, and for a few phages these have been confirmed experimen-tally ( Ford et al., 1998b ;Hatfull and Sarkis, 1993 ;Morris et al., 2008 ). Many
mycobacteriophages also encode three to four relatively small genes at theend of the virion structural and assembly operon that may also be involvedin tail assembly. Which of these tail proteins is specifically involved in host
recognition is unclear. Interestingly, a number of genomes (e.g., in Clus-
ters/Subclusters A1, C1, D, E, F, H1, I1, and J and singletons Corndog andWildcat) encode a putative b-lactamase-like
D-alanyl- D-alanine carboxy-
peptidase activity that is presumably involved in modification of the cellwall and perhaps facilitates productive association of the tail tip with thecell wall or membrane. However, none of these have been characterized.The lengths of mycobacteriophage tails, especially those with siphoviralmorphologies, vary considerably, and the lengths of tapemeasure protein
genes vary correspondingly ( Pedulla et al., 2003 ). These proteins are of262
Graham F. Hatfull
Author's personal copyparticular interest because many of them encode short sequence motifs
associated with peptidoglycan hydrolysis, suggesting functionalities inaddition to a role in phage tail assembly ( Laiet al., 2006 ;Pedulla et al.,
2003). Initially, three distinct motifs were discovered ( Pedulla et al., 2003 ),
although the expanded genomic set suggests that there are at least sevendifferent motifs (L. Marinelli and Graham F. Hatfull, manuscript in prepa-ration). The motif present in TM4 (motif 3) has been shown to be nones-sential for viability, although mutants in whom it has been deleted orinactivated have reduced abilities to infect stationary phase cells ( Piuri
and Hatfull, 2006 ). Because removal of the motif results in a corresponding
reduction in tail length, the tapemeasure protein must be able to adopt two
different conformations, an extended rod-like structure involved in tail
assembly and a component of the complete tail structure, and a foldedstructure that has enzymatic activity ( Piuri and Hatfull, 2006 ). Even
though peptidoglycan-hydrolyzing motifs cannot be identified in allmycobacteriophages, it seems probable that all can form this proposedalternative folded state. Because most of the mycobacteriophage tapemea-sure proteins also contain putative transmembrane-spanning domains—as many as nine in the Cluster G genomes—an intriguing role for all these
tapemeasure proteins is as a membrane-located pore through which DNA
traverses to gain entry into the cell (L. Marinelli and Graham F. Hatfull,manuscript in preparation).
B. Genome recircularization
Virion DNA is expected to be linear in all mycobacteriophages, and inClusters A, E, F, G, I, J, K, and L and in singletons Corndog, Giles, andWildcat, the genomes have defined ends with short ssDNA extensionvarying from 4 to 14 bases in length; all have 3
0extensions ( Table I ).
Following DNA injection, all are expected to be circularized at an earlystage, prior to either DNA replication or integration. The specific require-ment for circularization has not been examined, but it is expected that for
most phages it is dependent on the action of the host DNA ligase. The
kinetics of recirularization are not known.
Two phages with defined ends appear to use a different and an
unusual mechanism involving nonhomologous end joining (NJEJ).Phages Omega and Corndog both have 4-base ssDNA extensions, sub-stantially shorter than all the others (9–14 bases), and are different from allother mycobacteriophages in that they also encode a Ku-like protein thatfacilitates DNA end association in bacterial NHEJ systems (see Sections
III.J and III.M.1)( Pitcher et al., 2006 ). Both M.smegmatis andM.tuberculosis
encode NHEJ systems, including a Ku-like protein and an associated
DNA ligase (Lig IV)( Aniukwu et al., 2008 ;Pitcher et al., 2005 ). Interest-
ingly, efficient infection of M.smegmatis by Corndog and Omega isMycobacteriophages 263
Author's personal copydependent on the host Lig IV, but not on the host Ku-70 protein ( Pitcher
et al., 2006 ). Presumably, the phage-encoded Ku-70 is required for infec-
tion, although this has yet to be demonstrated. A conundrum in the
implication of NHEJ in genome circularization is that either the phage
Ku-70 gene would need to be expressed immediately upon DNA injectionor the protein would need to be encapsulated in the phage capsids.Unfortunately, mutants of Omega or Corndog lacking Ku-like geneshave yet to be constructed.
It is likely that mycobacteriophages with terminally redundant ends
are circularized by homologous recombination. However, it is unclearwhether this is dependent on phage-encoded functions or whether host
recombinases are utilized. In phage P22 it is proposed that the Erf recom-
binase, which is essential for phage growth, promotes genome circulari-zation ( Botstein and Matz, 1970 ). We note that mycobacteriophages in
Clusters E and L and the singleton Wildcat all encode Erf-family proteins,but their genomes have defined ends, not terminally redundant ends;presumably the Erf-like proteins they encode perform alternative func-tions. Of those phages that do have terminally redundant ends, onlyCluster C phages encode an obvious recombinase, a RecA-like protein
(gp201). Cluster B, D, and H phages do not encode a recognizable recom-
binase at all, thus presumably either exclusively use host recombinationenzymes for genome circularization or encode novel recombinases cur-rently uncharacterized.
C. DNA replication
Mycobacteriophage DNA replication represents another understudiedbut interesting aspect of their biology. Presumably, replication involvesa combination of phage- and host-encoded functions and is initiated atone or more origins of replication in the phage genome, although nonehave been identified. Many of the genomes do not encode their own DNApolymerase and presumably use one or more of the resident polymerases.
Others do encode their own DNA polymerase, although both DNA Pol I
and Pol III subunits are well represented; LeBron unusually encodes aDNA Pol II-like protein. It has not been shown, however, that any of theseare essential for replication or whether host enzymes can be utilized ifphage polymerases are inactivated. For the most part, other componentsof the replication machinery presumably are provided by the host,although we note that Corndog unusually encodes a Pol III clamploader-like protein (see Section III.M.1). Many genomes also encode pre-
dicted DNA primases, although there is great diversity among the types
of proteins encoded. For example, in some phages (e.g., in Cluster A),primase functions are associated with two adjacent open reading frames,raising the possibility that a functional enzyme is generated by an264
Graham F. Hatfull
Author's personal copyunusual translation event (such as a programmed frameshift or a ribo-
some hop) or by processing at the RNA level. In other phages, the primasefunction is associated with proteins that also provide either predicted
helicase activities (as in Cluster B and K phages) or polymerase functions
(as in Clusters D and H and Corndog). Many of the phages also encodeapparent stand-alone canonical DNA helicases, frequently of the DnaBfamily. The gp65 protein of D29 has been characterized and shown to be astructure-specific nuclease with a preference for forked DNA structures(Giri et al., 2009 ).
Most mycobacteriophages encode a Holliday Junction resolvase,
although many different types are represented, including those related
to Endo VII, RuvC, and RusA, and they are present in a multitude of
genomic locations. Notable exceptions are phages in Clusters D, E, F, andH, raising the possibilities that either these employ different strategies inreplication and recombination or encode one or more novel classes of HJresolvases that have not been recognized previously. Because Hollidayjunctions are strongly deleterious to DNA packaging and many of thephages encode recombination-promoting proteins, we favor the second ofthese explanations.
D. Virion assembly
Identification of genes involved in virion structure and assembly is facili-tated by their conserved gene order (at least in Siphoviridae), even thoughthe sequences are highly diverse. For example, capsid subunits can beidentified in most of the genomes—with perhaps the greatest ambiguityin Cluster H phages ( Fig. 11 )—although they represent many different
sequence phamilies ( Hatfull et al., 2010 ). Nonetheless, it is plausible that
they contain similar protein folds to that of the HK97 capsid subunit thatis also present in other viruses that lack substantial sequence similaritywith it ( Fokine et al., 2005 ;Hendrix, 2005 ;Johnson, 2010 ;Wikoff et al.,
2000). In some of the genomes there is an identifiable scaffold protein
encoded immediately upstream of the capsid gene, and in L5, gp16 hasbeen shown to be a component of head-like particles but absent fromintact virions ( Hatfull and Sarkis, 1993 ). Putative scaffold genes are pres-
ent in many other mycobacteriophage genomes but are divergent at thesequence level and their assignments remain tentative until there is fur-ther experimental support. In some mycobacteriophages, the scaffoldfunction may be provided by an N-terminal domain of the capsid proteinitself, as in HK97 ( Duda et al., 1995 ). In L5, D29, and TM4 there is strong
evidence that the major capsid subunit is covalently cross-linked ( Ford
et al., 1998a,b ;Hatfull and Sarkis, 1993 ), as described for HK97, and it may
be a common feature among mycobacteriophages ( Hatfull and Sarkis,Mycobacteriophages 265
Author's personal copy1993). But not all do so, and there is evidence against it in Giles ( Morris
et al., 2008 ).
As noted earlier, all three phages in Cluster I and the singleton Corn-
dog have prolate heads in contrast to all other mycobacteriophages,
which have isometric heads. The dimensions are somewhat different,with Cluster I phages having a length:width ratio of 2.5:1 and Corndoga ratio of 4:1. However, no evident sequence similarity exists betweentheir capsid subunits, although we note that a closely related protein toCluster I capsid subunits is encoded within the genome of Streptomyces
scabies (55% amino acid identity), suggesting the presence of a prophage
capable of generating prolate-headed particles. It is unclear how the
length of these prolate capsids is determined, and at least in Cluster I
phages, there is no evidence from genome analysis of genes encodingadditional capsid-associated proteins (see Section III.I and Fig. 12 ). In
Corndog, this is less clear because of the greater complexity of the virionstructure and assembly operon ( Fig. 16 ).
Like many other phages with siphoviral morphologies, most myco-
bacteriophages contain a set of four to eight genes located between themajor capsid and the major tail subunit that are likely involved in the
head–tail joining process. For the most part, these genes are shared among
genomes within a subcluster, but only in a few instances are relativesobserved in other mycobacteriophages. When they do, they are typically(although not always) as groups of genes that appear to be travelingtogether; one example is PBI1 genes 20–22(Fig. 7 ), which have homolo-
gues in similar genomic locations in Cluster H phages ( Fig. 11 ). These
observations are consistent with the idea that these head–tail connectorproteins have to interact with each other physically.
One of the most highly conserved features of tail assembly genes of
Siphoviridae is the expression of two genes between the major tail subunitand the tapemeasure protein genes that are expressed via a programmedtranslational frameshift to produce tail assembly chaperones ( Xuet al.,
2004). A programmed frameshift can be identified in nearly all mycobacter-
iophage genomes, and the majority (Cluster A, C, D, E, and G and Wildcat)use a canonical -1 frameshift as described for phage lproteins G and G-T
(Levin et al., 1993 ), whereas others (Clusters F and I, Corndog, and Omega)
use a þ1 (or possibly /C02). Somewhat surprising given the strong conserva-
tion of this feature among phages of diverse bacterial hosts, no similarframeshifting events have been identified in Cluster B phages.
Some mycobacteriophages have the unusual feature of sharing short
but related C-terminal extensions on the ends of their capsid and majortail subunits ( Hatfull, 2006 ). This was first evident from sequencing of the
Bxb1 genome ( Mediavilla et al., 2000 ), as the predicted capsid and major
tail subunits are both /C2485 residues longer than their counterparts in L5 as
a consequence of C-terminal extensions. Moreover, Bxb1 extensions are266
Graham F. Hatfull
Author's personal copyrelated to each other (47% amino acid identity). Related sequences are
present in all other Subcluster A1, A4, B2, and B3 phages situated simi-larly at the C-terminal ends of their capsids and major tail subunits.
HHPred analysis shows predicted structural similarity of these to the
C-terminal part of the phage lmajor tail subunit (gpV), which is part of
the large Big-2 family of Ig-like domains ( Fraser et al., 2006 ;Pellet al., 2009,
2010). Related sequences are found in some other mycobacteriophage
proteins, including several copies in a putative minor tail protein inBxb1 (gp23) and in putative structural proteins in Cluster C1 phages(e.g., Bxz1 gp24). Wildcat and LeBron capsid and major tail subunits havesimilar types of extensions, and although the sequences are distinct from the
others, they are related to other Ig-like domains. The presence of these Ig-
like domains is relatively common in phage structural proteins, althoughtheir functional roles are unclear. Removal of the C-terminal domain fromLambda gpV results in a 100-fold reduction in viability and a possible defectin tail assembly ( Pellet al., 2010 ), although the relationships between the
closely related mycobacteriophage capsids and major tail subunits contain-ing these extensions (e.g., Bxb1) and those that do not (e.g. L5) suggestthat these are likely not essential in these mycobacteriophage contexts.
E. Lysis
All mycobacteriophage genomes sequenced to date contain an identifiablelysin A (endolysin) gene encoding a peptidoglycan-hydrolyzing enzyme.
However, sequence comparisons show that they are highly modular in
nature and encompass a broad span of predicted enzyme specificities;there is no single amino acid sequence motif in common to all. Despitetheir very different sequences, the Lysin A proteins of D29, Ms6, and TM4have all been shown to have peptidoglycan-hydrolyzing activity ( Garcia
et al., 2002 ;Henry et al., 2010a ;Payne et al., 2009 ). Inactivation of the lysin A
gene in Giles ( 31) results in the loss of phage release without interruption
of particle assembly ( Marinelli et al., 2008 ;Payne et al., 2009 ). Delivery of
the peptidoglycan hydrolase to its target is likely facilitated by a holinprotein; in most mycobacteriophages, a putative holin gene can be identi-fied closely linked to lysin A and encoding a small protein with one ormore strongly predicted membrane-spanning domains. However, theseare highly diverse at the sequence level and none have been examinedexperimentally. Interestingly, in phage Ms6, gene 1product (a close rela-
tive of Fruitloop gp28, 97% amino acid identity; Fig. 9 ) has chaperone-like
features and interacts directly with the endolysin to facilitate delivery to its
peptidoglycan target in a holin-independent manner ( Catalao et al., 2010 ).
Relatives of this protein are also encoded in Subcluster A1 genomes, where
it is also closely linked to the lysis genes—and in the Subcluster K1 phageTM4 (gp90), where it is not. Mycobacteriophages are unusual in encodingMycobacteriophages 267
Author's personal copya second lysis protein, Lysin B, that promotes efficient lysis of the host ( Gil
et al., 2008 ;Payne et al., 2009 ). Deletion of the Giles lysin B gene ( 32) does
not lead to loss of viability but gives a reduction of plaque size and the
number of particles contained therein ( Payne et al., 2009 ). A few phages do
not encode Lysin B, including Che12, Subcluster B2 phages, and the C2
phage Myrna, although not all of these form noticeably small plaques. InMyrna, there is an additional unrelated gene ( 244) implicated in lysis,
although it is not known if it substitutes for lysin B activity ( Payne et al.,
2009). Lysin B has been shown to be a lipolytic enzyme ( Gilet al., 2008 ;
Payne et al., 2009 ), and the crystal structure of D29 Lysin B reveals struc-
tural similarity to cutinase family enzymes ( Payne et al., 2009 ). D29 Lysin B
has activity as a mycolylarabinogalactan esterase and is proposed toseparate the mycolic acid-rich mycobacterial outer membrane from itsarabinogalactan anchor ( Payne et al., 2009 ). Ms6 Lysin B acts similarily
(Gilet al., 2010 ). Lysin B can thus be thought of as providing a function
analogous to the Rz/Rz1 or spanning proteins encoded by phages ofGram-negative bacteria, which play a role in compromising the integrityof the outer membrane through fusion to the cytoplasmic membrane andfacilitating complete lysis ( Berry et al., 2008 ).
VII. GENETIC AND CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF
MYCOBACTERIOPHAGES
Mycobacteriophages have played a central role in the development oftuberculosis genetic systems ( Jacobs, 2000 ), and the large set of sequenced
mycobacteriophage genomes provides a rich source of materials for appli-cations both in mycobacterial genetics and in potential clinical applications.Some of these take advantage of the use of whole phage particles, and in
these applications the host range is likely to be especially important.
Because only Subcluster A2 and Cluster K phages infect M. tuberculosis
efficiently, these have proven the most useful for these utilities. For devel-opment of genetic tools, host range is of less concern because most, if not allof, the genetic functionalities are likely to function equally well in bothM.smegmatis and M.tuberculosis . In at least one example, the reason for
lack of phage infection of M. tuberculosis can be ascribed to a failure of either
adsorption or DNA injection, not phage metabolism per se (R. Dedrick and
Graham F. Hatfull, unpublished observations).
A. Genetic tools
1. Integration-proficient vectors
Integration-proficient vectors are those that carry the integration appara-
tus of a temperate phage and have no other means of DNA replication.The first to be constructed were derived from L5 ( Lee et al., 1991 ),268
Graham F. Hatfull
Author's personal copyalthough others with different chromosomal targets have since been
reported ( Freitas-Vieira et al., 1998 ;Morris et al., 2008 ;Murry et al., 2005 ;
Pham et al., 2007 ). The only phage requirements are the integrase gene
and a functional attPsite; because the attPsite is typically closely linked to
the integrase gene, simple versions of these vectors often can be con-structed by inserting a single DNA fragment into a nonreplicating plas-mid vector. It should be noted though that although integrase genes canusually be identified readily easily, identification of a functional attP is
more error-prone. As discussed previously, the core region within whichrecombination occurs can usually be identified readily, but attPfunction
usually requires flanking sequences containing arm-type integrase-bind-
ing sites (see Section IV.B.1). In some phages, these too can be predicted
bioinformatically ( Morris et al., 2008 ), but in other genomes, this is more
difficult. Nonetheless, the functional requirements for attP are usually
encompassed with a region no larger than about 250–300 bp. Plasmidderivatives can also be used in which the attPsite and the integrase gene
are introduced on separate fragments ( Huff et al., 2010 ).
Of the potential 13 different attB sites that can be used for vector
construction ( Table II ,Fig. 21 ), vectors have been described for at least
six of them: attB-1 (Lee et al., 1991 ),attB-2 (Pham et al., 2007 ),attB-6
(Sampson et al., 2009 ),attB-7 (Kim et al., 2003 ),attB-10 (Freitas-Vieira
et al., 1998 ), and attB-12 (Morris et al., 2008 ). Two additional site specifi-
cities have been described that use integration systems derived fromStreptomyces phages or plasmids. Vectors derived from plasmidpSAM2 integrate site specifically into at attB overlapping tRNA
progene
Msmeg_6204 and the tRNAprogene located between Rv3684 and Rv3685c
inM.tuberculosis H37Rv ( Martin et al., 1991 ;Seoane et al., 1997 ). Phage
phiC31-derived vectors (using a serine-integrase) integrate into an attB
site located within the putative glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferasegene Msmeg_3400 and presumably inactivate it; there are three potentialattB sites in M.tuberculosis (Murry et al., 2005 ). L5 integration-proficient
plasmids have also been manipulated such as to carry an additional attB
site that will accept secondary integration events ( Saviola and Bishai,
2004), and the Ms6 system has been manipulated so as to use alternative
tRNA
alagenes as integration sites ( Vultos et al., 2006 ). Integrated
sequences can also be switched efficiently by introduction of a secondplasmid with the same integration specificity and a second selectablemarker ( Pashley and Parish, 2003 ).
Integration-proficient plasmid vectors have several advantages over
extrachromosomally replicating vectors. For example, introduction ofgenes in single copy typically avoids the overexpression seen with extra-chromosomal vectors and thus avoids complications that can be encoun-tered in complementation experiments. Second, they can have greater
stability in the absence of selection relative to extrachromosomal vectors,Mycobacteriophages 269
Author's personal copyprovided that the phage-encoded excise functions are not also present.
Even in the absence of excise, integrase-mediated excise-independentexcisive recombination can lead to plasmid loss, which may be exacer-
bated in recombinants that are at a selective disadvantage ( Springer et al.,
2001). Improved stability can be provided if the integrase gene is absent
from the recombinant, which can be accomplished either by introducing
the integrase gene on a second, nonreplicating plasmid that issubsequently lost ( Pen˜aet al., 1997 ) or by site specifically removing the
integrase gene from the recombinant ( Huff et al., 2010 ). Phage-encoded,
site-specific recombination systems are also useful for efficient modifica-tion of recombinants, and excisive recombination by L5 integrase has
been used to demonstrate gene essentiality ( Parish et al., 2001 ).
2. Selection by immunity
Temperate phages are immune to phage superinfection. If the superin-
fecting phage is defective in lysogeny and thus efficiently kills the bacte-rial cells, then this provides an effective means for using phage immunityfunctions—and repressor genes specifically—as selectable markers. Thishas been demonstrated using the L5 repressor gene ( 71) and using either
D29 or a clear-plaque mutant of L5 ( Donnelly-Wu et al., 1993 ). Phage
particles can be spread readily onto solid media prior to plating of cells,
and relatively large numbers of cells can be plated and still get efficient
killing of nontransformed cells. The obvious advantage of such systems isthat they avoid the use of antibiotics and are thus useful for constructingcomplex recombinants where relatively few markers are available, formanipulation of strains that are extensively drug resistant even withoutmanipulation, and to minimize biosafety concerns of generating highlydrug-resistant forms of pathogenic strains. Because there are a substantialnumber of distinct mycobacteriophage immune specificities (see Section
V.A), there is the potential to construct a large collection of compatible
markers, at least for M.smegmatis . Although there are a large number of
phages that encode identifiable integrases, only in Cluster A and ClusterG phages have repressor genes been identified. Phage repressors appearto be highly diverse and, in many cases, will need to be identified experi-mentally. We also note that immune selection requires the isolation of aclear-plaque derivative of the phage, and we note that because many ofthe temperate mycobacteriophages often form lysogens at relatively low
frequencies, this is not always a simple task.
3. Generalized transduction
Generalized transduction is one of the most useful tools broadly imple-
mented in bacterial genetics because it provides a simple means ofmoving genetic markers and mutations into different strain backgrounds.As such, it becomes easy to construct isogenic strains and to thus draw270
Graham F. Hatfull
Author's personal copyconfident conclusions about the correlation between genotype and phe-
notype. Generalized transducing phages are typically those that packagetheir DNA by headful-packaging systems and thus have genomes that are
terminally redundant and circularly permuted. As described earlier, there
are many mycobacteriophages in this class, including those in Clusters B,C, D, and H.
The first mycobacteriophage demonstrated to mediate generalized
transduction of M.smegmatis was I3 ( Raj and Ramakrishnan, 1970 ), a
myovirus whose complete genome has not been sequenced, but is likelyto be a Cluster C-like phage. It has been shown subsequently that Bxz1 isalso a generalized transducing phage and can be used to efficiently
exchange genetic markers between strains of M.smegmatis (Lee et al. ,
2004). It is highly likely that other members of Cluster C behave similarly.
Transduction by phages of Clusters A, D, and H has yet to be
demonstrated.
No phages capable of generalized transduction of M.tuberculosis have
been identified. This is unfortunate because there is a particular need forsuch phages to construct isogenic strains, especially for the analysis ofmutations that occur in clinical isolates and that may be suspected of
contributing to drug resistance or pathogenicity phenotypes. We note that
none of the known mycobacteriophages with circularly permuted termi-nally redundant genomes infect M.tuberculosis . Although such phages
may well exist in nature and await isolation, there is also the possibilitythat the idiosyncrasies of homologous recombination systems inM. tuberculosis—especially their proclivity for illegitimate recombinationof linear DNA substrates introduced by electroporation ( Kalpana et al.,
1991)—could have thwarted the successful evolution of such phages.
4. Transposon delivery
Several transposons have been described that can be used for insertionalmutagenesis in M.tuberculosis and M.smegmatis (Cirillo et al., 1991 ;
Fomukong and Dale, 1993 ;Guilhot et al., 1992 ;Rubin et al., 1999 ). Myco-
bacteriophages offer attractive systems for transposon delivery because ofthe high efficiency of infection and the ability to deliver transposon DNAto nearly every cell in a liquid culture. This is especially important giventhe relatively low frequencies of movement of most transposons in bacte-ria. Phage delivery of transposons has the additional advantage overplasmid delivery systems in that the mutants recovered result from inde-pendent transposition events, providing the opportunity to generatemutant libraries of a large number of different insertions ( Lamichhane
et al., 2003 ;Sassetti et al., 2001 ), which is critical for applications such as
transposon site hybridization ( Sassetti et al., 2003 ).
For efficient phage-mediated transposon delivery, it is important that
lytic growth of the phage does not lead to cell death ( Kleckner et al., 1991 ).Mycobacteriophages 271
Author's personal copyConditionally replicating mutants of both D29 and TM4 have been
described that grow normally at 30/C14C but fail to replicate at higher
temperatures (37/C14C for TM4, 38.5/C14C for D29)( Bardarov et al. , 1997 ).
These mutants were isolated to ensure low frequencies of reversion towild-type replication patterns, a potential concern when seeking selectionof relatively low frequency transposition events. Coupling of thesemutant phages with shuttle phasmids enables introduction of a varietyof transposons of choice and has created a facile system for mutagenesisof a variety of mycobacterial strains. The phasmids can be prepared andgrown in M.smegmatis at 30
/C14C, but then used to infect M.smegmatis orM.
tuberculosis at the nonpermissive temperature and selection for transpo-
son mutants on solid media ( Bardarov et al., 1997 ).
5. Specialized transducing phages
Conditionally replicating mycobacteriophages also provide a powerfulapproach to the delivery of allelic exchange substrates for constructingmycobacterial mutants, including gene knockout and gene replacementmutants ( Bardarov et al., 2002 ). The approach is similar to that for trans-
poson delivery, and construction of a phasmid carrying a DNA substratein which an antibiotic resistance marker is flanked by 500–1000 bpcorresponding to the flanking sequences of the gene to be replaced.
Following infection, gene replacement mutants can be selected by antibi-
otic resistance. Because effectively every cell can be infected by the phage,the number of recombinants should be very high, even if gene replace-ment occurs in only a relatively small proportion of cells. In practice, onlyperhaps 10
-6or fewer cells generate recombinants, although a very high
proportion of these result from homologous recombination at theintended site ( Bardarov et al., 1997 ), in contrast to the high proportion of
illegitimate events observed when introducing linear DNA fragments by
electroporation ( Kalpana et al., 1991 ). The reason why the recovery of
recombinants is relatively inefficient is not known, although it suggests
that there is a substantial opportunity to increase the recovery of thenumber of recombinants.
6. Mycobacterial recombineering
Recombineering [genetic engineering using recombination ( Court et al.,
2002)] offers a general approach to constructing mutant bacterial
derivatives by taking advantage of the high frequencies of homologousrecombination that can be accomplished by the expression of phage-encoded recombination systems. Perhaps the most widely used system
inE.coliis the l-encoded Red system in which three proteins, Exo,
Beta, and Gam, contribute to recombination proficiency. Exo is an exonu-
clease that degrades one strand of dsDNA substrates, Beta is a proteinthat promotes pairing of complementary DNA strands, and Gam is an272
Graham F. Hatfull
Author's personal copyinhibitor of RecBCD ( Court et al., 2002 ). When either dsDNA or short
ssDNA substrates are introduced into E.coliby electroporation, recombi-
nation with a chromosomal or plasmid target occurs efficiently; in some
configurations, desired recombinants can be identified even without
selection. Similar systems have been described that utilize the RecETsystem encoded by the E.coli rac prophage ( Murphy, 1998 ;Zhang
et al., 1998 ).
The E.colirecombineering systems do not function well in mycobac-
teria, especially when using dsDNA substrates ( van Kessel and Hatfull,
2007, 2008a ). Mycobacterial-specific recombineering systems have been
developed using mycobacteriophage-encoded recombinases, especially
those related to the RecET systems ( van Kessel and Hatfull, 2007, 2008a,
b;van Kessel et al., 2008 ), such as genes 60and61of phage Che9c ( Fig. 12 ).
When both Che9c gp60 and gp61 are expressed from an inducible expres-
sion system in M.smegmatis orM.tuberculosis , recombination frequencies
are elevated substantially. Introduction of a dsDNA allelic exchangesubstrate in which 500–1000 bp of chromosomal homology flank anantibiotic resistance marker, followed by selection, generates recombi-nants efficiently ( van Kessel and Hatfull, 2007 ). dsDNA recombineering
works well and reproducibly in M.smegmatis , but anecdotal reports
suggest that it may be somewhat more erratic in M.tuberculosis , perhaps
due to irreproducibility of efficient expression of the recombinases.
Recombineering using ssDNA substrate requires only short synthetic
oligonucleotide-derived substrates, provided that mutations are intro-duced that confer a selectable phenotype ( van Kessel and Hatfull,
2008a ). Interestingly, in both M.smegmatis and M.tuberculosis there is a
very substantial strand bias, such that oligonucleotides with complemen-
tary sequences can yield recombinants at frequencies differing by more
than 10
4-fold ( van Kessel and Hatfull, 2008a ). For engineering purposes
it is therefore important that the most efficient of the two possible oligo-nucleotides is used, which is usually that corresponding to the leadingstrand of chromosomal DNA replication (i.e., can base pair with thetemplate for lagging strand synthesis). ssDNA recombineering can beused to generate recombinants in the absence of direct selection usingcoelectroporation of two oligonucleotides: one designed to introduce the
desired mutation and one that can be used for selection. A high propor-
tion of selected recombinants also carry the unselected mutation and canbe detected by physical screening ( van Kessel and Hatfull, 2008a ).
Recombineering provides an especially powerful tool for genetic
manipulation of the mycobacteriophages themselves ( Marinelli et al.,
2008;van Kessel et al., 2008 ). The Bacteriophage Recombineering of Elec-
troporated DNA (BRED) system involves coelectroporation of a phagegenomic DNA substrate and a short ( /C24200 bp) dsDNA substrate in a
strain in which recombineering functions have been induced. PlaquesMycobacteriophages 273
Author's personal copycan then be recovered on solid media in an infectious center configuration
in which each electroporated cell that has taken up phage DNA gives riseto a plaque. When individual plaques are screened for the presence of
either wild-type or mutant alleles at the targeted site, all contain the wild-
type allele, but 10% or more also contain the mutant allele ( Marinelli et al.,
2008). The desired phage mutant can then be recovered from this mixed
primary plaque by replating and testing individual secondary plaques. Inthis way, two rounds of polymerase chain reaction analysis of 12–18plaques typically generates the desired mutant, provided that the mutantis viable. In at least some cases, nonviable plaques can be recovered bycomplementation ( Marinelli et al., 2008 ;Payne et al., 2009 ). BRED can be
used to introduce insertions, deletions, and point mutations into myco-bacteriophage genomes ( Marinelli et al., 2008 ).
B. Clinical tools
1. Phage-based diagnosis of M.tuberculosis
The ability of mycobacteriophages to infect mycobacterial hosts specifi-cally and efficiently has led to three types of systems for the diagnosis ofM.tuberculosis infections. There is a particular need for such systems
because the diagnosis of human tuberculosis is complicated by the slowgrowth of the bacteria, the need to determine drug susceptibility profiles,and the fact that the demographic and geographic areas of greatest needoften have only minimal resources to devote to this issue. An inexpensive,
rapid, simple diagnostic system for drug susceptibility testing of
M.tuberculosis is therefore highly desirable.
The first phage-based diagnostic developed was the phage-typing
approach in which a substantial number of mycobacteriophages wereisolated whose host ranges were informative about the identity of anyunknown host ( Engel, 1975 ;Redmond and Ward, 1966 ). In this way, an
unknown clinical isolate could be tested for susceptibility to a set ofphages and preliminary identification was obtained within a few days.
Of particular note in this regard is the use of phage DS6A, whose host
range is restricted to bacteria of the M.tuberculosis complex, including
Mycobacterium bovis ,Mycobacterium africanum, Mycobacterium canetti , and
Mycobacterium microti (Bowman, 1969 ;Jones, 1975 ). DS6A has not yet been
characterized genomically. Although phage typing is useful for strainidentification, it does not readily provide information about drug suscep-tibility profiles.
A second phage-based diagnostic system is the phage amplification
biological assay (PhaB), which is based on the ability of mycobacterio-phages to infect and amplify in M.tuberculosis if present in a clinical
sample, followed by enumeration of particles using M.smegmatis as a
host ( Eltringham et al., 1999 ;Watterson et al., 1998 ;Wilson et al., 1997 ).274
Graham F. Hatfull
Author's personal copyPhage D29 has been the primary focus for this approach because it infects
both M.tuberculosis and M.smegmatis and produces large, clear, easily
identifiable plaques. The system has been evaluated with clinical speci-
mens in several studies and has been used to discern rifampicin-resistant
and rifampicin-sensitive hosts ( Albert et al., 2001, 2002a,b, 2004 ;
McNerney et al., 2000 ;Paiet al., 2005 ). The third approach is the use of
reporter mycobacteriophages in which recombinant phages carrying areporter gene, such as firefly luciferase (FFlux) or GPF (or related fluores-cence genes), can be used to detect the physiological status of the cellrapidly, thus reporting on drug susceptibilities ( Jacobs et al., 1993 ;Piuri
et al., 2009 ). These phages can be constructed readily using either shuttle
phasmid technology or BRED recombineering ( Marinelli et al., 2008 ) and
can be used in several configurations depending on the reporter geneused and the detection technology available. Fluoromycobacteriophageshave some notable advantages in that it is possible to detect single cellsfollowing infection and the signal is retained after fixation, providingadditional biosafety and assay flexibility ( Piuri et al., 2009 ). The assay is
rapid, and the use of light-emitting, diode-based microscopes provides apotentially simple clinical configuration. Establishment of efficient phage
infection conditions directly in sputum samples remains the highest
priority for direct clinical evaluation. Although reporter phages havebeen derived from TM4 ( Jacobs et al., 1993 ), D29 ( Pearson et al. , 1996 ),
and L5 ( Sarkis et al., 1995 ), none of these are specific to M.tuberculosis , and
as with the PhaB assay, use of M.tuberculosis-specific phages would be
advantageous.
2. Phage therapy?
Mycobacteriophages would seem to have some advantages for directtherapeutic treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis, especially in circum-stances in which MDR-TB and XDR-TB infections respond poorly toantibiotic therapy. Delivery directly to the lung would seem feasible,and there are reports of evaluation in animal model systems ( Koz’min-
Sokolov and Vabilin, 1975 ;Sula et al., 1981 ). The potential disadvantage is
that the phage particles may not gain access to bacteria that are intracel-lular, or contained with granulomas, and therefore a therapeutic curewould seem improbable. Bronxmeyer and colleagues (2002) haveexplored successfully the possibility of using M.smegmatis as a surrogate
to deliver TM4 to M.tuberculosis -infected macrophages, suggesting a
novel route to killing intracellular bacteria ( Broxmeyer et al., 2002 ) and
circumventing this problem. Phage resistance poses another potential
concern, which could potentially be overcome by using either serial
applications of phages to which different mechanisms of phage resistanceoccur or phage cocktails with broad combinations of phages. The actualnumber of phages currently available for such an application is ratherMycobacteriophages 275
Author's personal copysmall, with D29 being the most attractive candidate. If phage therapy is to
be evaluated, it will be important to identify additional mycobacterio-phages that infect both M.tuberculosis andM.smegmatis (for propagation
purposes), kill a very high proportion of bacterial cells upon infection,and represent different patterns of host resistance responses. A relatedapplication is the possibility of using mycobacteriophages to interferewith active dissemination of tuberculosis from an actively infected personto household contacts, family members, and/or co-workers. Becausedissemination likely involves forms of bacteria susceptible to phage infec-tion, application of a suitable phage preparation by inhalation, aspiration,or nebulization could reduce the number of M.tuberculosis cells passing
through the upper respiratory tract greatly and reduce the chances oftransfer to an uninfected individual. An especially attractive configura-tion would be to use phages in a prophylactic form to protect those inclose contact from acquisition from a patient, while enabling the infectedperson to undergo a normal course of antibiotic therapy. This would alsominimize opportunities for the selection of phage-resistant mutantsbecause the number of bacteria in contact with the phage is relativelysmall. However, success of this approach is anticipated to depend on the
ability to deliver an effective quantity of phage particles, stability of the
particles, and the likelihood that multiple doses over a period of time willbe required for maximum effectiveness.
VIII. FUTURE DIRECTIONS
As the collection of sequenced mycobacteriophage genomes has grown, ithas become abundantly clear how much we really do not understandabout this fascinating group of viruses. For the most part, future direc-tions are reasonably clear, and five major paths can be envisaged.
First, it is clear that much more needs to be learned about the genetic
diversity of mycobacteriophages. As more mycobacteriophage genomes
are sequenced, the numbers of more closely related phages have grown,
but entirely new genomes continue to emerge, as well as phages related tothose classified previously as singletons. The combination of animmensely powerful and high-impact integrated research and educationplatform for phage isolation, and the dramatic decline in genomicsequencing costs, will help fuel this ongoing effort in mycobacteriophagegenome and discovery. It is not unreasonable to suppose that the collec-tion of sequenced mycobacteriophage genomes could rise to more than
1000 within the next 5years. Presumably, at some point we will reach the
point of genomic saturation where further genomic sequencing will pro-vide diminishing returns, but it is unclear when that will be reached. Wenote that although isolating entirely new genomes is thrilling, the276
Graham F. Hatfull
Author's personal copycollection of groups of related phages provides powerful resources for
understanding the detailed mechanisms of genome evolution. Currentphages all share a common host in M.smegmatis mc
2155, but preliminary
observations (C. Bowman and Graham F. Hatfull) show that some of thesecan discriminate between different substrains of M.smegmatis . It is thus
likely that use of other M.smegmatis strains for phage isolation or different
mycobacterial species will yet further expand the amazing diversity of themycobacteriophage population. Moreover, it is critical that additionalphages that infect M. tuberculosis be isolated using M.tuberculosis itself
either as a host or as a surrogate that is much more closely related to itthan M.smegmatis . Second, it will be important to establish the detailed
host specificities of the sequenced mycobacteriophages. A plausible rea-son for their great diversity in nucleotide sequence, genome length, andGC% is that they share different but overlapping host ranges, with M.
smegmatis mc
2155 being the common host. One approach would be to test
the susceptibilities of known strains within Actinomycetales for infectionby the mycobacteriophages, although it is important to recognize thatthese may poorly reflect the full diversity of bacteria in the environmentsfrom which the phages are isolated. Another approach would be to
characterize the bacterial population of the samples from where phages
are isolated more extensively, although this is complicated by the massivecomplexity of the soil biome and the likelihood that many of them,including potential mycobacteriophage hosts, are not cultivatable.
A third major area of focus should be on determination of what the
many unknown mycobacteriophage genes do, using both functionalgenomic and structural genomic approaches. The BRED engineeringtechnology provides a powerful means of constructing defined phage
mutants, including gene knockouts and point mutations, and large num-
bers of mutants can be generated and characterized readily. Thus it is nowpossible to apply functional genomic approaches to whole genomes andto dissect them genetically. Structural genomic approaches will also beuseful, especially as many of the phage-encoded genes are small, and theencoded proteins should be amenable to structural analysis by crystallog-raphy and nuclear magnetic resonance. Structural information shouldprovide clues as to potential functions, but phage proteins may also be a
rich source of novel protein folds, especially given their vast sequence
diversity. These functional genomic and structural approaches areimmensely powerful, although the sheer number of genes to analyzemakes this an important but daunting prospect.
The fourth major direction is to characterize the patterns of mycobac-
teriophage genome expression, identify the signals for transcription initi-ation and termination, and elucidate the mechanisms of gene regulation.Little is known about the global patterns of mycobacteriophage gene
expression, although the genomes should be amenable to transcriptomeMycobacteriophages 277
Author's personal copyanalysis using either microarrays or high throughput RNA-seq. In only a
small number of examples have putative promoters been identified, and itis clear that many promoters cannot be readily identified bioinformati-
cally. Investigation of gene expression and its regulation is expected to be
especially rewarding, as previous studies reveal an abundance of novelty,such as with the remarkable stoperator system in Cluster A phages, andnew systems for lytic–lysogenic decision systems in Cluster G phages.Moreover, it seems likely that some mycobacteriophage-encoded proteinsare expressed from prophages with the capacity to influence hostphysiology, and a combination of expression and functional studies mayprovide important clues, especially in examples where phage-encoded
proteins may influence pathogenicity. Finally, there are numerous poten-
tial routes to exploit the mycobacteriophages to develop additional toolsfor mycobacterial genetics. These range from additional integration-proficient vectors with novel attBtarget specificities, a suite of repressor-
mediated selectable markers, and regulated expression systems tomycobacteriophage-specific packaging systems, mycobacteriophage-based antigen display systems, new tools for mutagenesis, and applica-tions for diagnosis and therapy. The world is your oyster.
