ABSTRACT 
 
The objective of this study was to investigate the capacity of decolorization and detoxification of th e 
textile dyes Reactive Red 198 (RR198), Reactive Blu e 214 (RB214), Reactive Blue 21 (RB21) and the 
mixture of the three dyes (MXD) by Penicillium simplicissimum INCQS 40211. The dye RB21, a 
phthalocyanine, was totally decolorized in 2 days, and the others, the monoazo RR198, the diazo RB214 
and MXD were decolorized after 7 days by P. simplicissimum . Initially the dye decolorization involved 
dye adsorption by the biomass followed by degradati on. The acute toxicity after fungal treatment was 
monitored with the microcrustacean Daphnia pulex  and measured through Effective Concentration 50% 
(EC 50 ). P. simplicissimum  reduced efficiently the toxicity of RB21 from mode rately acutely toxic to minor 
acutely toxic and it also reduced the toxicity of R B214 and MXD, which remained minor acutely toxic. 
Nevertheless, the fungus increased the toxicity of RR198 despite of the reduction of MXD toxicity, whi ch 
included this dye. Thus, P. simplicissimum  INCQS 40211  was efficient to decolorize different textile dyes 
and the mixture of them with a significant reductio n of their toxicity. In addition this investigation  also 
demonstrated the need of toxicological assays assoc iated to decolorization experiments.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Textile industry is a very important segment in the  
Brazilian economy, with considerable growth in the last 
years. As a consequence, there is an increase of 
environmental contamination caused by the large amo unt of 
dyes involved in the textile process that are disch arged in the 
liquid effluents. Approximately 10t15% of the dyes are 
released into the environment (38). Azo dyes are the main chemical class of dyes with t he 
greatest variety of colors, therefore they have bee n 
extensively used by the industry. These dyes are 
characterized by one or more azo linkages (R 1tN=NtR 2) and 
by aromatic structures (22, 40). The biological eff ects of azo 
dyes after biotransformation have been shown to be toxic 
(34), and in some cases these compounds are carcino genic 
and mutagenic (14, 29).

There are many effective wastewater treatments; 
however these technologies are highly expensive. Bi ological 
treatments that have been conventionally applied pr esent 
certain drawbacks. Some textile dyes are relatively  resistant 
to microbial degradation, besides that anaerobic 
microorganisms when degrading some dyes produce aro matic 
amines that may be toxic and carcinogenic (47). The refore, in 
recent years, there have been intensive researches on fungal 
decolorization of textile wastewater. The use of fu ngi is a 
promising alternative to replace or supplement curr ent 
treatments (8, 13, 18). 
Several fungi are capable of mineralizing pollutant  
compounds through their highly oxidative and nontsp ecific 
ligninolytic enzymes, which are also responsible fo r the 
decolorization and degradation of many different dy es (13). 
The white rot fungi, members of the Basidiomycetes,  as 
Funalia trogii  (47), Phanerochaete chrysosporium  (3, 27), 
Trametes versicolor  (34), Trametes hirsuta  (1), Irpex lacteus  
(Novotný et al, 2004) and Lentinula edodes (5, 21) are 
extremely efficient for textile dye degradation. 
Studies on nontbasidiomycete fungi that degrade dye s 
are reduced; nevertheless these fungi are also very  efficient 
for metabolizing a wide range of compounds, particu larly by 
demethylation and oxidation (6). Aspergillus species (14, 24, 
36), Cunninghamella elegans  (2), Penicillium geastrivorus  
(46), P. ochrochloron (37), Pestalotiopsis guepinii  (35) and 
Umbelopsis isabellina  (46) were found to be successful for 
removing textile dyes from liquid media. 
Despite of the efficiency of biological treatments,  in some 
cases microorganisms can transform dyes into compou nds 
more toxic than the original compound,  consequently there is a need to evaluate the toxici ty of the 
end product after the biological treatment. For thi s purpose 
some toxicological assays can be applied, including  tests 
using microcrustacean Daphnia spp., routinely used to 
determine toxicity of chemicals for the establishme nt of 
environmental health standards due to their small s ize, short 
life cycle, high reproduction rates and their key e cological 
role in the aquatic food chains (20, 41, 43). Thus,  the aims of 
the present study were to investigate the ability o f Penicillium 
simplicissimum  INCQS 40211 to decolorize three reactive 
dyes and the mixture of these dyes, as well as the 
determination of their toxicity after fungal treatm ent using 
the ecotoxicological assay with the microcrustacean  Daphnia 
pulex. 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
Chemicals 
The dyes used in the investigation were Remazol Red  RB 
(C.I Reactive Red 198), a monoazo, Drimarene Navy X tGN 
(C.I. Reactive Blue 214), a diazo, and Remazol Turq uoise 
Blue G (C.I. Reactive Blue 21), a phthalocyanine. C hemical 
structures of the dyes are illustrated in Figure 1.  Solutions of 
these dyes were prepared by dissolving the dyes in distilled 
water then filtered through polyethersulphone membr ane 0,22 
µm. 
The dyes Reactive Red 198 (RR198), Reactive Blue 21  
(RB21) and Reactive Blue 214 (RB214), were chosen b ased 
on their wide use in the textile industry in Brazil  and 
throughout the world.

Microorganism 
The fungus used in this work, Penicillium 
simplicissimum INCQS 40211 (CCT 6686), was previously 
isolated from sediment collected from Rio Piaçaguer a 
(23°52′22.6′′S, 46°23′34.6′′W) in São Paulo State, Brazil, an 
area of estuarine habitat, under the influence of d ifferent 
sources of industrial contamination, including orga nochlorine 
pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), furan s and 
dioxins, organic halogens and polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons (PAHs) (11). Among several fungi teste d 
regarding their tolerance to pyrene, P. simplicissimum 
INCQS 40211 (CCT 6686) was the only isolate that ha d a 
better growth in the presence of pyrene than in its  absence 
and demonstrated the highest tolerance to pyrene (1 1). In a 
further study the same fungus degraded pyrene and p roduced 
a metabolite as the result of pyrene degradation (1 0). Besides 
these studies, another investigation demonstrated t he capacity 
of a different strain of P. simplicissimum  to degrade 
polyethylene (45). Therefore, based on these abilit ies to 
degrade different compounds P. simplicissimum  was selected 
for the following experiments. 
Penicillium simplicissimum INCQS 40211 is deposited in 
the Culture Collection of INCQS/FIOCRUZ, Rio de Jan eiro 
(RJ), Brazil. The culture has been maintained on ma lt extract 
agar and czapek yeast agar at 4°C and criopreserved . 
 
Culture conditions 
The fungus was inoculated into potato dextrose agar  
(PDA) containing the dyes separately in a final con centration 
of 200 mg L t1 and the three dyes mixed at a final 
concentration of 66.6 mg L t1 for each dye. The agar plates 
after inoculation were incubated at 28ºC. Following  
incubation for 5 days 9 mycelial plugs (5 mm diamet er) from 
the colony margin were used as inoculums, they were  
transferred to conical flasks containing 150 mL of potato 
dextrose broth (PDB). Following 2tday incubation at  28°C on 
a rotary shaker at 140 rpm, 100 mg L t1 of each dye was added 
(23, 28) and the mixture containing 33.3 mg L t1 of each dye 
was also added. Control experiments were performed       
under the same conditions described above but witho ut fungi. 
 
Decolorization 
Aliquots of the fungal culture after 0, 2, 5, 7 and  14tday 
incubation following the addition of the dyes were 
centrifuged at 10.000 g for 10 min, and then the su pernatant 
was diluted 1:10 with distilled water and were meas ured 
spectrophotometrically using a Shimadzu UVt1601 (Ky oto, 
Japan) spectrophotometer. For RR198 the absorbance was 
observed at 520 nm, for RB21 it was at 675 nm, for RB214 it 
was at 610 nm and for the mixture of the three dyes  (MXD) it 
was at 620 nm. The color removal was reported as pe rcentage 
decolorization (%) = (A b – A a)/A b X 100, where A b is the 
absorbance of the initial dye solution (day 0) and A a is the 
absorbance at cultivation time (2, 5, 7 and 14 days ) (32). All 
assays were conducted in triplicate in the dark and  results 
were expressed as the mean values with the standard  
deviation calculated. 
 
Ecotoxicity 
The freshwater microcrustacean Daphnia pulex  was used 
for the acute toxicity determination and the method ology 
applied was based on OECD 202 protocol (31). D. pulex  was 
cultured in mineral water (Minalba®) in a temperatu ret
controlled chamber at 23 ± 1 °C, with a light inten sity of 40 
µE m −2  s −1  and a 12:12 h light:dark cycle. The daphnids were 
fed with the chlorophyte Ankistrodesmus falcatus (strain 
NPINt1) that was cultured in MBL medium (39). 
The toxicity determination was conducted with the l iquid 
media containing the dyes before and after the 14td ay 
incubation with P.  simplicissimum. The liquid media was 
filtered through polyethersulfone membrane 0,22 µm and the 
supernatant was evaluated. The method applied was s tatic 
using 20 neonates divided in two groups of 10 indiv iduals for 
concentrationttest. The mineral water was used as d ilution 
water for the concentrationttest and as control. Th e time of 
exposition was 24 hours under constant temperature of 24°C 
and in the dark.  811  
 
 
 Decolorization of dyes by P. simplicissimum  
 
 
 
The supernatants were tested in a concentration ser ies 
(0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 3.1, 6.2, 12.5, 25, 50, 75, 10 0%) in order to 
obtain the 24h exposition average Effective Concent ration 
(24htEC 50 ), which is the concentration where 50% of the 
daphnids were affected (mortality or immobility), a nd was 
estimated by Trimmed Spearman Karber  regression analysis 
(19). The EC 50  obtained were classified according to Verma 
(43). 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Decolorization 
 
The standard deviation of the triplicates of each d ye and 
the dye mixture was calculated for the five periods  of 
decolorization analyses (0, 2, 5, 7 and 14 days of incubation) 
and the deviation was not higher than 0.02% (data n ot 
shown). Therefore, the results were reproducible fo r the three 
dyes tested and their mixture. P. simplicissimum INCQS 40211 decolorized completely 
(100%) RR198 dye in liquid media after 7tday incuba tion 
(Fig. 2). The dye was adsorbed by the biomass; neve rtheless, 
it was possible to observe visually a reduction of the dye 
adsorption from the 5 th  to the 7 th  day of incubation (Fig. 3). 
In the presence of RB21 the liquid media was 100% 
decolorized by P. simplicissimum  INCQS 40211 within 2 
days of incubation (Fig. 2) and it was observed the  biomass 
adsorbing the blue dye. The color on the biomass wa s 
reduced gradually from the 5 th  until the 14 th  day of incubation 
when the biomass was completely free from the dye ( Fig. 3). 
Phanerochaete chrysosporium , the most studied fungus 
regarding degradation of a wide range of pollutant 
compounds, was tested in the presence of the same d ye RB21 
in a concentration two times higher; yet it decolor ized 
completely the dye after 7 days. In the same invest igation it 
was also noted that copper from the dye was adsorbe d by the 
fungal biomass during the initial stages of dye dec olorization 
(8).

incubation. 
 
 
The copper in the molecular structure of the dye RB 21 
may influence the ability of decolorization by some  fungi as 
formerly observed by Novotný et al. (30) regarding another 
dye containing copper. In another study with the sa me dye it 
was found that the dye was resistant to decolorizat ion by 
cultures of methanogenic bacteria (15). P. simplicissimum  
INCQS 40211 compared to those other microorganisms 
showed more efficiency for treating this kind of dy e. 
The third dye tested, RB214, was 100% decolorized a fter 
7 days by P. simplicissimum  INCQS 40211, however the 
reduction of the color from the biomass was slower than the 
observed with the two other dyes, RR198 and RB21 (F ig. 2 
and 3), possibly due to its more complex molecular structure 
(Fig. 1).  When the fungus was cultivated in the presence of t he 
 mixture of the three dyes, MXD, it decolorized 100 % of the 
culture supernatant after 5 days (Fig. 2) when the biomass 
visually had adsorbed most of the dyes. From the 5 th  day till 
the 14 th  day of incubation there was a gradual reduction of  
the color on the biomass until complete disappearan ce (Fig. 
3). 
During the present experiment it was demonstrated t he 
efficiency of P. simplicissimum  INCQS 40211 to decolorize 
the three different kinds of dyes, a monoazo (RR198 ), a diazo 
(RB214) and a phthalocyanine (RB21), with differenc es in 
the decolorization ability regarding each dye teste d, which 
might be dependent on dye structure (18). Relativel y small 
structural differences can markedly affect decolori zation (25).

                            Decolorization of dyes b y P. simplicissimum  
 
Yet the relationship between the molecular structur e of the 
dyes and their decolorization by fungi is still unc lear. 
The decolorization of the liquid media was confirme d by 
the disappearance of the characteristic peak of the se dyes 
during the spectrophotometric experiments (Fig. 4).  In the 
meantime the dyes were adsorbed by the biomass and from 
visual observation they gradually disappeared from its 
surface. Visual observation of the biomass is an im portant aspect in dye decolorization investigation, since i t allows the 
distinction of biomass adsorption from microbial de gradation 
(7, 48). Therefore, the reduction of color on the b iomass 
observed in Figure 3 with the three dyes and the dy e mixture 
indicates a potential dye degradation by P. simplicissimum  
INCQS 40211.

A study conducted by Zheng et al. (50) showed that 
Penicillium  sp. removed the dyes Poly Rt478 and Poly St119 
by adsorption and subsequently degraded them. Works  on 
dye decolorization by P. simplicissimum  were not found in 
the literature, this is the first report, yet there  are studies on 
enzymatic activities by this fungus. Zeng et al. (4 9) observed 
the production of laccase and that the activity of this enzyme 
increased significantly after the exhaustion of sim ple carbon 
source, cellulose, and the use of a more complex ca rbon 
source, lignin. Other investigations showed the pro duction of 
intracellular enzymes by P. simplicissimum , such as vanillyltalcohol oxidase and catalasetperoxidase, which are 
responsible for metabolizing a variety of compounds  (16, 17). 
Based on these findings it might be possible that t he 
biomass decolorization, promoted by P. simplicissimum  
INCQS 40211 from the 5 th  to the 14 th  day of incubation, was 
initiated after the consumption of the simple carbo n source, 
glucose, leading the fungus to use the dyes as the source of 
complex carbon through intra or extracellular enzym es. It 
would be necessary further investigations on enzyme  
activities involved in the dye degradation by this fungus.  814 BergstentTorralba, L.R. et al. 
 
 
Ecotoxicity 
The effluents from textile industries even after th e 
treatment can remain toxic and mutagenic; nonethele ss they 
are released into the environment any way. Conseque ntly, the 
inefficiency of this process leads to the need of t oxicological 
assays after effluent treatment (12, 26, 42). Thus,  in the 
present investigation the toxicological tests were performed 
using daphnids since they have been found to be sen sitive 
(41) and used as important models to evaluate the 
toxicological implications that may result from azo  dyes to 
the environment (4, 44). 
The 24htEC 50 , obtained with the acute toxicity test using 
Daphnia pulex , of the liquid media before and after the 
fungal treatment with P. simplicissimum INCQS 40211 was 
determined (Table 1). The dyes RR198, RB214 and MXD  before the treatment were minor acutely toxic (EC 50 =10t
100%) while the dye RB21 was moderately acutely tox ic 
(EC 50 =1t10%). The toxicity observed for this phthalocyan ine 
dye is probably due to the presence of cooper in it s chemical 
structure (Fig. 1). This toxicity has already been observed by 
Novótny et al. (30) when testing another dye contai ning 
copper, which inhibited fungal growth. Despite of M XD 
being constituted also by the toxic dye RB21, the l ow toxicity 
of the mixture is probably due to fact that RB21 wa s in a low 
concentration (33.3 mg L t1), as was also concluded by Fu & 
Viraraghavan (18). After the fungal treatment, P. 
simplicissimum INCQS 40211 efficiently reduced the toxicity 
of this dye, the 24htEC 50  value was increased from 1.1% 
(moderately acutely toxic) to 20.3% (minor acutely toxic) 
(Table 1).

The fungus also reduced the toxicity of the dye RB2 14 
and the dye mixture, MXD. The EC 50 values of RB214 and 
MXD, were increased from 31.4% to 34.8% and from 42 .1% 
to 49.8%, respectively, remaining minor acutely tox ic (EC 50 =10t100%) (Table 1). Yet the contrary was observed 
with the dye RR198, after fungal treatment its toxi city 
increased from minor acutely toxic to moderately ac utely 
toxic (Table 1). The toxicity increase could be exp lained by   815  
 
 
the presence of metabolites produced by P. simplicissimum 
INCQS 40211 after decolorization, which was more to xic 
than the dye RR198, as it was formerly observed by Ramsay 
& Nguyen (34) with another dye. Despite of this tox icity 
increase, when RR198 was treated in the presence of  the 
other two dyes (MXD), the toxicity was reduced by P. 
simplicissimum INCQS 40211. Possibly in this case the toxic 
effect of the metabolite produced by the fungus was  
suppressed. Since the dyes are not present in the e nvironment 
isolated but in a mixture, the positive result obta ined with 
MXD is more important than the negative result with  RR198. 
The toxicological assay using daphnids showed a 
significant reduction of toxicity after dye decolor ization P. 
simplicissimum INCQS 40211, indicating that this process 
corresponds to an actual detoxification of the dyes . Even 
though the detoxification in some treatments is not  always 
reduced while the decolorization takes place, as it  happened 
in the present study with the dye RR198, there are very few 
studies that have evaluated the toxicological level  after dye or 
effluent treatment (26, 33, 41). Therefore, based o n these 
findings, the need of this kind of evaluation has b een 
confirmed. 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
Penicillium simplicissimum  INCQS 40211 was efficient 
to decolorize different kinds of dyes and the mixtu re of them 
by initially adsorbing them and subsequently degrad ing them, 
which led to the decolorization of the biomass. Thi s fungus 
was also capable to detoxify 2 dyes and the mixture  of the 
three dyes tested. More studies regarding dye degra dation and 
toxicity reduction by P. simplicissimum  INCQS 40211 are 
necessary. Yet, most importantly the results of thi s 
investigation demonstrated the great significance o f 
toxicological assays associated with decolorization  
experiments.
