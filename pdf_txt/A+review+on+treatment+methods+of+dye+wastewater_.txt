Abstract
Dye-decolorization is one of the most important steps in dye-polluted wastewater treatment. The dye-decolorization bacteria 
were isolated from active sludge collected from wastewater treating pond of a dyeing and printing plant using serial dilution 
method. Among the 44 bacteria isolates from the active sludge, the strain Bacillus amyloliquefaciens W36 was found to 
have strong ability in dye-decolorization. The effects of carbon source, nitrogen sources, C/N, metal ions, temperature, pH, 
and rotation speed for dye-decolorization were investigated. The optimum decolorization conditions were that the strain 
was grown in enriched mineral salt medium (EMSM) using maltose 1 g/L,  (NH4)2SO4 1 g/L as carbon and nitrogen source 
respectively, supplemented with 100 mg/L different dyes (pH 6.0), at 30 °C, 200 rpm from 48 to 96 h. The bacteria could 
aerobically decolorize dyes, such as Coomassie brilliant blue (95.42%), Bromcresol purple (93.34%), Congo red (72.37%) 
and Sarranine (61.7%), within 96 h. The dyes decolorization products were analyzed by ultra-violet and visible (UV–vis) 
spectroscopy before and after decolorization, which indicated that the four dyes were significantly degraded by the strain. 
The results indicated that the bacteria Bacillus amyloliquefaciens W36 could be used in dye-polluted wastewater treatment.

Introduction
Dyes are widely used in many industries, such as the tex-
tile, printing, food, pharmaceutical industry, and so on 
(Piaskowski et al. 2018). There are approximately 10,000 
different dyes, which are classified according to their usage, 
such as direct dyes, reactive, disperse dyes, acid dyes, and 
cationic dyes, et al. Most of the dyes have complicated 
groups in structure, such as aromatic, azo, anthraquinone, 
triarylmethane or phthalocyanine, which are the toxic, car -
cinogenic and mutagenic chemicals to human or other crea-
tures (Feng et al. 2012; Freeman 2013; Vikrant et al. 2018). 
These dyes are chemically synthesized. The synthetic dyes 
are highly stable to light, temperature, detergent and are very 
cheap and convenient in use (Vikrant et al. 2018). So they 
have been increasingly used in the textile and dyeing indus-
tries. Approximately 10–15% of used dyes would be dis-
charged into the wastewaters in dyeing processes. However, 
these dyes are very hard to be degraded in the environment. 
The discharge of the dye-containing wastewater without well 
treatment will cause serious harm to the aquatic ecosystem and will become a carcinogenic source to humans (Schnei-
der et al. 2004). As a result, how to treat the dye-polluted 
wastewater has raised great concern for the government and 
scientists.
China is one of the largest textile and dye-producing 
countries in the world. The annual dye production in China 
has reached 0.75 million tons since 2007, which accounted 
for 60% of world’s dye production. In textile manufacturing 
and dyeing processes, if the dye-polluted wastewater was 
not well treated, it would cause serious pollution to water 
environments (Ren et al. 2013).
In general, dye-polluted wastewater is often treated by 
physical or chemical methods, such as coagulation, pre-
cipitation, adsorption, or physic-chemical methods by 
electrolysis or ozone oxidation method to destroy the dye 
molecules (Muhd Julkapli et al. 2014; Piaskowski et al. 
2018; Vikrant et al. 2018). However, these methods are 
generally costly, inefficient, and of limited applicabil-
ity in treating the dye effluent (Piaskowski et al. 2018; 
Vikrant et al. 2018). They produce some wastes, which are 
even harder to be degraded (Piaskowski et al. 2018). The World Journal of Microbiology and Biotechnology            (2021) 37:8  
1 3 Page 3 of 11     8 
biological treating processes in wastewater purification are 
more attractive, because of their low cost. They produce 
less sludge, and are environmentally friendly (Vikrant 
et al. 2018). Many different aromatic or azo recalcitrant 
dyes could be degraded by some special microorganisms 
possessing the dye-degrading ability in the environment. 
Over the past decades, many microorganisms which were 
capable of degrading synthetic dyes had been found and 
studied, including fungi, yeasts, actinomycetes, and bac-
teria (Blanquez et al. 2019; Kaushik and Malik 2009; 
Pajot et al. 2011; Zablocka-Godlewska et al. 2018). Some 
fungi, especially white rot fungi, could produce lignino -
lytic enzyme, such as lignin peroxidase (LiP), manga-
nese peroxidase (MnP) and laccase and could be applied 
in the decolorization of dyes (Kaushik and Malik 2009; 
Rodriguez Couto 2009; Wesenberg et al. 2003). Some 
bacteria have been reported to have strong efficiency in 
dye-decolorization. The mechanism of dye-decoloriza-
tion in microorganisms was supposed to be absorption, 
biodegradation or biotransformation (Kuhad et al. 2004). 
Different microorganisms have their own special way of 
decolorizing the various types of dyes. The growth speed 
of fungi is slow, which would decrease the efficiency in 
wastewater treatment (Fu and Viraraghavan 2001; Kaushik 
and Malik 2009; Piaskowski et al. 2018). So, the applica-
tions of fungal decolorization were limited (Kaushik and 
Malik 2009). Although many bacteria have been found to 
have the ability of dye-decolorization, most of the bacteria 
could only decolorize certain types of dyes (Cerboneschi 
et al. 2015; Lalnunhlimi and Krishnaswamy 2016; Modi 
et al. 2010). So, it is necessary to find more specific bac-
teria to decolorize various types of dye.
Our study aims to isolate some bacterial strains, which 
have strong abilities in dye-decolorization. A bacterium B. 
amyloliquefaciens W36 possessing the ability to decolorize 
dyes efficiently was chosen for further study and the factors 
affecting dye-decolorization were investigated.
Materials and methods
Chemicals and reagents
The chemicals of seven dyes Crystal violet, Congo red, Mal-
achite green, Carmine, Bromocresol purple, Sarranine, and 
Coomassie brilliant blue were obtained from Parduk Com-
pany (Jinghua, Zhejiang, China). All the other chemicals 
used in this study were analytical grade and were purchased 
from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (Shanghai, 
China). The enzyme and reagents used in PCR amplifica -
tion were obtained from Sangon Biotech (Shanghai) Co., 
Ltd. (Shanghai, China).Isolation and screening of the dye‑decolorization 
strains
The strains were isolated from the active sludge, which was 
collected from the wastewater treating pond in Fenghuang 
Company, Meixinda or Dagong Textile Printing and dying 
Co., Ltd (Huzhou, Zhejiang, China). The enrichment culture 
was conducted by adding 1 g of active sludge into 100 mL of 
enriched mineral salt medium (EMSM) in a 250 mL Erlen-
meyer flask and incubating in a shaker at 30 °C 120 rpm for 
7 days. The mineral salt medium (EMSM) was consisted of 
(g/L):  K2HPO4 1.0 g,  KH2PO4 1.0 g,  MgSO4 0.2 g,  FeSO4 
0.05 g,  NH4SO4 1.0 g, glucose 1 g, yeast extract 2.5 g, 
sodium lignosulfonate 0.3 g, pH adjusted to 7.0. The strains 
were isolated by serial dilution of the cultural broth solu-
tion to  10−7–10−9 and plating in EMSM solid medium. The 
plates were incubated at 30 °C for 2–3 days. The individual 
colony was picked up and streaked 2–3 times in EMSM 
to purify the strain. The strains were stored in the EMSM 
medium containing 15% (v/v) glycerol at − 80 °C.
Congo red has several aromatic rings and complicated 
structures and is one of the commonly used dyes for screen-
ing of decolorization strain (Ibrahim et al. 1996). The strains 
were screened by inoculating each strain to 10 mL EMSM 
liquid medium supplemented with Congo red (0.1 g/L) and 
incubated in a shaker at 30 °C 120 rpm for 7 days. Sam-
ples were taken from the culture broth and centrifuged at 
12,000 rpm for 3 min at room temperature. 200 μL of super -
natant was taken to measure the absorbance of Congo red 
at 497 nm using a microplate reader (ThermoFisher, USA). 
The strain with the highest decolorization rate was selected 
for further study.
Identification of the selected dye‑decolorizing 
strain
The strain was grown in EMSM medium at 30 °C for 
48 h. The morphological and physiological features of the 
strain were observed and tested by the method described 
by Buchanan et al. (1994). The genomic DNA of the strain 
was extracted by the method described previously by Steiner 
et al. (1995). The 16S rRNA gene was amplified with the 
primers 16S-F (5′ -AGA  GTT TGA  TCA  TGG CTC  AG-3′ ) and 
16S-R (5′ -TAC GGT TAC CTT  GTT ACG  ACTT-3′ ). The PCR 
reaction was performed in 50 μL reaction system under the 
conditions, initial denaturation at 94 °C for 4 min, followed 
by denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 52 °C for 
1 min, extension at 72 °C for 1 min 30 s, and a final exten-
sion at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR product was purified and 
sequenced by Sangon Biotechnology Co., Ltd (Shanghai, 
China). The 16S rRNA sequence of the strain was submit-
ted and blast in Genbank. The 16S rRNA sequences which 
were highly phylogenetically similar to the decolorization  World Journal of Microbiology and Biotechnology            (2021) 37:8 
1 3     8  Page 4 of 11
strain were retrieved from Genbank. The phylogenetic tree 
was constructed using software MEGA V 7.0.26 through 
neighbor-Joining methods.
Effect of culture medium components 
on dye‑decolorization
To investigate the effect of various carbon sources and nitro -
gen sources on dye-decolorization, 1% (w/v) different car -
bon sources (glucose, fructose, maltose, lactose, starch) and 
1% (w/v) nitrogen sources  (NH4)2SO4,  NaNO3,  NH4Cl, urea, 
peptone, yeast extract, corn steep liquor, fish meal, soybean 
cake) were supplemented in EMSM medium, respectively. 
The strain was activated by inoculating the strain into 20 mL 
EMSM medium in a 100 mL Erlenmeyer flask and incubat -
ing at 30 °C shaker with a rotation speed of 120 rpm and cul-
turing for 16–18 h until OD600 reached 0.8–1,0. Then 1 mL 
culture broth was inoculated into 50 mL EMSM medium 
containing 1%(w/v) of different carbon sources or nitrogen 
sources and 0.1 g/L Congo red in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer 
flask. The strain was cultured in a shaker at 30 °C for 7 days 
with a shaking speed 200 rpm. Samples were taken every 
2 days from the cultural broth and used for test cell density 
and dye concentration.
To study the effect of carbon source and nitrogen sources 
(C/N) ratio on dye-decolorization, the best carbon source 
and nitrogen source were selected. The different C/N ratio 
was set as (1:1, 2:1, 3:1 4:1, w/w) in the EMSM medium. 
The strain was cultured with the same conditions as above.
Metal ions are often activators or inhibitors to the enzyme 
involved in dye-decolorization (Ibrahim et al. 1996). To 
check the effect of metal ions on dye-decolorization, 5 mM 
different metal ions of sulphate  (Cu2+,  Mg2+,  Mn2+,  Ca2+, 
 Zn2+,  Co+,  Na+,  Fe2+,  K+) were supplemented in the EMSM 
medium containing 0.1 g/L Congo red, with the best carbon, 
nitrogen source and C/N for dye-decolorization. The strain 
was cultured with the same conditions as above.
Effect of culture conditions on dye‑decolorization 
rate
The strain B. amyloliquefaciens W36 was grown in 20 mL 
EMSM medium in a 100 mL Erlenmeyer flask at 30 °C and 
120 rpm for 16–18 h as inoculums. All the decolorization 
experiments were performed in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask. 
1 mL of culture broth was inoculated into 50 mL EMSM 
medium containing Congo red 0.1% (w/v) and incubated 
in a shaker at 30 °C 120 rpm for 7 days. Effect of different 
factors on the decolorization of Congo red was investigated 
via a single factor experiment, i.e. changing the factors 
once at a time and keeping other parameters as constants. 
The factors were temperature (10, 25, 30, 35 °C), pH (5.0, 
6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0) and shaking speed (100, 150, 200, 250 rpm). When investigating the factor temperature, the pH 
of EMSM medium was adjusted to 7.0. When investigating 
pH, the temperature for dye-decolorization was set at the 
optimum condition. When investigating rotation speed, the 
best temperature and pH for dye-decolorization were fixed 
at the optimum condition. The samples were taken from the 
culture broth after cultivation for 96 h. The cell density was 
measured by a microplate reader (Thermofisher, USA) at 
600 nm. The dye concentration was assayed at the maximum 
absorbance of the dyes using the same microplate reader. 
The cultural medium without inoculation was used as blank. 
All assays were performed in triplicate.
The dye‑decolorizing ability of the strain
To detect the decolorizing ability of the strain, different 
0.1 g/L dyes (Crystal violet, Congo red, Malachite green, 
Carmine, Bromocresol purple, Sarranine, Coomassie bril-
liant blue) was supplemented in EMSM medium with the 
optimum carbon, nitrogen source, metal ions, and C/N. The 
strain was cultured with the same conditions as above.
Analysis methods
The cell density and dye concentration were measured by 
a microplate reader (Thermofisher, USA) at 600 nm or the 
maximum absorbance of each dye, respectively. The maxi-
mum absorbance of the dyes Crystal violet (λmax 590 nm), 
Congo red (λmax 497 nm), Malachite green (λmax 614 nm), 
Carmine (λmax 609 nm), Bromocresol purple (λmax 590 nm), 
Sarranine (λmax 555 nm), Coomassie brilliant blue (λmax 
595 nm) were obtained by scanning the 0.1 g/L dye-contain-
ing EMSM medium. All assays were performed in triplicate. 
The cultural medium without inoculation was used as blank. 
The decolorized product was scanned with the microplate 
reader (Thermofisher, USA) in the wavelength range of 200 
to 1000 nm.
The decolorization efficiency was calculated by the for -
mula. Decolorization rate (%) = (A0 − A)/A0 × 100, where 
A0 is the initial absorbance and A is the absorbance of the 
medium after decolorization with the strain.
Results
Isolation and identification of the dye‑decolorizing 
strain
After several times of isolation from the active sludge 
samples, 44 dye-decolorization strains were obtained. 
The strain with the highest decolorization rate (56.13%) to 
Congo red was selected for further study. The colonies of World Journal of Microbiology and Biotechnology            (2021) 37:8  
1 3 Page 5 of 11     8 
the strain were flat-shaped and bulged in the middle, light 
yellow, rough on the surface and irregular on the edge.
The 16S rRNA gene of the strain was amplified by PCR. 
The sequence of it was deposited in GenBank (accession 
number SUB6817070 Bacillus MN922613). The nucleo-
tide alignment of 16S rRNA sequence of the strain with 
Genbank showed that the strain exhibited 100% homology 
to Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. The evolutionary relation-
ship analysis from the phylogenetic tree indicated that the 
strain has the closest relationship with the strain Bacillus 
amyloliquefaciens strain md1-41 ( Fig. 1). Therefore, it was 
identified as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens W36.Effect of culture medium on dye‑decolorizing
The effect of culture medium on dye-decolorizing was inves-
tigated (Fig.  2). Carbon sources affect the dye-decolorization 
of the strain significantly. As shown in Fig.  2a, maltose is the 
best carbon source for dye-decolorization. The dye-decol-
orization efficiency of the strain is 80.66% when maltose 
was used as the carbon source. It is much higher than that of 
other carbon sources in culture medium.
To investigate the effect of nitrogen source on decolori-
zation rate, various organic and inorganic nitrogen sources 
were added into the culture medium. As it is shown in 
Fig.  2b, the decolorization rate was greatly affected by the 
Fig. 1  Phylogenetic tree of B. 
amyloliquefaciens W36. The 
GenBank accession number was 
shown in front of each species 
of the microorganism. Bootstrap 
values were exhibited at each 
branch. Scale bar indicated

n = 3). Lower case letters indicate the variation between different 
groups, as analyzed by one-way ANOVA (P < 0.05) World Journal of Microbiology and Biotechnology            (2021) 37:8

addition of various nitrogen sources.  NH4Cl and  (NH4)2SO4 
were the best nitrogen sources for dye-decolorization. The 
decolorization efficiency was achieved at 72.80% or 65.97%, 
respectively.
C/N is also an important factor affecting decolorization. It 
could be shown from Fig.  2c that the highest decolorization 
rate (72.46%) was achieved when C/N was set as 1:1. With 
the increase of the ratio of C/N, the decolorization rate was 
decreased slightly.
The effect of metal ions on the decolorization rate is 
shown in ( Fig.  3). The best metal ions for dye-decoloriza-
tion for this strain are the addition of 5 mM K+ or  Na+ to 
the culture medium and the decolorizaition efficiency was 
reached at 75.41% or 77.01%, respectively. The addition of 
 Co+ in the cultural medium reduced the dye-decolorization 
efficiency, which might be because  Co+ is harmful to the 
cell growth or metabolism. Metal ions are the activator or inhibitor of the key enzymes involving in the dye-decol-
orization, which will affect the enzyme activities (Ibrahim 
et al. 1996).
Effect of culture conditions on dye‑decolorizing
The effects of cultural conditions on the decolorization 
rate of B. amyloliquefaciens W36 were shown in (Fig.  4). 
It could be inferred from the results that the decoloriza-
tion rate increased as temperature increased (Fig.  4a). The 
dye-decolorization efficiency was achieved 51.42% at the 
optimum temperature 30 °C. Most microorganisms have an 
optimum temperature range to grow. The strain can grow 
better and utilize the substrate at the optimum temperature. 
The optimum pH for decolorization and cell growth was pH 
6.0. The cell growth and decolorization rate decreased as 
the pH increased (Fig.  4b). pH is also important for bacte-
rial growth. The decolorization rate increased with the rota-
tion speed was increased. The cell growth decreased slightly 
when the rotation speed increased from 100 to 200 rpm, 
while the cell growth increased at the rotation speed of 
250 rpm (Fig.  4c). It is indicated that the strain is aerobic in 
decolorization.
The decolorization ability assay
The decolorization ability on 7 different dyes by the strain 
B. amyloliquefaciens W36 was studied (Fig.  5). The strain 
could decolorize Bromocresol purple and Coomassie bril-
liant blue efficiently. The decolorization rate could achieve 
95.42% and 93.34%, respectively. 72.37% of Congo red 
could be decolorized by this strain. However, it could not 
decolorize Crystal violet and Malachite green. It could 
decolorize Sarranine (61.07%) and Carmine (37.08%).

strain B. amyloliquefaciens W36 was cultured in EMSM medium 
supplemented with 0.1% (w/v) Congo red and different metal ions

shown in the figures (mean ± SEM, n = 3). Lower case letters indi-

Sarranine) were further studied. Results showed that the 
strain could decolorize Bromocresol purple and Coomassie 
brilliant blue within 48–96 h, decolorize most of Congo red 
and Sarranine after 72–96 h. The strain grew rapidly within 
24 h supplemented with the dyes Congo red and Bromo-
cresol purple in the culture medium, while it grew slowly 
before 48 h and rapidly after 48 h with dyes Coomassie bril-
liant blue and Sarranine in the culture medium. The four 
dyes did not affect the strain growth (Fig.  6). The decoloriza-
tion results were clearly shown in Fig.  7.
As shown in Fig.  8, the peak absorbance of dyes almost 
decreased completely after 3 days of decolorization. The 
cell mat showed the same color as the dyes, which indicated 
the decolorization was also partly due to being absorbed by 
the strain.
Discussion
Some fungi have been found to have strong ability in dye-
decolorization due to dye-biosorption or biodegradation (Fu 
and Viraraghavan 2001; Murugesan and Kalaichelvan 2003). 
However, fungi grow much slower than bacteria and need

more time in dye-decolorization (Vikrant et al. 2018). In this 
study, we found B. amyloliquefaciens W36 could decolorize 
four different dyes Coomassie brilliant blue (95.42%), Brom-
cresol purple (93.34%), Congo red (72.37%) and Sarranine 
efficiently within 48–96 h, which is faster than most of fungi. 
The dye-decolorization efficiency was compared with other 
strains (Table  1), B. amyloliquefaciens W36 showed good 
efficiency in dye decolorization in the optimum conditions.
Dye-decolorization efficiency was greatly affected by 
cultural medium and cultural conditions. Cultural medium 
affects strain growth, metabolism, and enzyme produc-
tion, which has a significant influence on dye-decolori-
zation. The most preferred carbon resource for the strain 
B. amyloliquefaciens W36 growth and decolorization was 
maltose. However, the favorite carbon source for other 
strains was glucose or sucrose (Holkar et al. 2014; Lal-
nunhlimi and Krishnaswamy 2016; Wang et al. 2009). 
Because the metabolism of dye-decolorization pathway may be different, the favorite carbon source may be vari-
ous from different strains. Nitrogen sources are also impor -
tant to strain growth and dye-decolorization. In this study, 
 NH4Cl and  (NH4)2SO4 are found to be the best nitrogen 
sources for strain growth and decolorization. While the 
best nitrogen sources for decolorization were yeast extract 
or peptone in some other strains (Chen et al. 2003; Modi 
et al. 2010).  NH4Cl and  (NH4)2SO4 are inorganic nitro-
gen sources, which have been commonly used in culture 
medium to cultivate strains and they are easy to be uti-
lized to grown cells or produce some metabolites. Carbon 
sources are usually used to grow cells in strain cultivation. 
Addition of too much of carbon source in culture medium 
may not benefit bacteria to decolorization. The results are 
in accordance with previous reports that a high concentra-
tion of carbon sources in the culture medium will inhibit 
the decolorization of some bacteria (Chen et al. 2003). 
In our study, we found the addition of 5 mM K+ or  Na+

to the culture medium could enhance decolorization effi-
ciency. Metal ions have often been used as an activator for 
enzymes or been used to adjust osmotic pressure in the 
cell. The metal ions requirements for decolorization are 
different for different microorganisms (Galai et al. 2009; 
Shankar and Shikha 2015; Tan et al. 2009).
The dye-decolorization was affected by temperature, 
pH, and oxygen significantly. In this study, we found 
that the decolorization rate increased with temperature 
increase. The results are similar to most of the bacterial 
decolorization (Karim et al. 2018 ; Kolekar and Kodam 
2012; Lalnunhlimi and Krishnaswamy 2016). pH plays an 
important role in cell growth and dye-decolorization. The 
strain B. amyloliquefaciens W36 grows and decolorizes 
at a narrow pH range. The results are in accordance with 
most decolorizing bacteria that have a narrow pH range 
in decolorization (Lalnunhlimi and Krishnaswamy 2016; 
Tan et al. 2016). While in some other strains, the suitable 
pH ranges for dye-decolorization were broad (Anjaneya 
et al. 2011; Chen et al. 2003; Ren et al. 2006). The strain 
B. amyloliquefaciens W36 grows and decolorizes better in 
aerobic conditions. It needs oxygen in dye-decolorization. 
The sample was taken from the oxygen- exposed pond 
of wastewater treatment, so it is highly possible that the 
strain is an aerobic strain. Many strains could decolorize 
dyes under the aerobic condition (Tan et al. 2016, 2013).
In our study, we found the cell mat showed the same 
color as the dyes, while the supernatant showed very less 
color in decolorization. It indicated the strain could absorb 
or biodegrade the dyes in the decolorization process. It 
has been reported that decolorization of dyes by bacteria 
could due to absorption or biodegradation (Keharia and 
Madamwar 2003; Piaskowski et al. 2018). The plasmid 
was extracted from the strain. However, no plasmid was 
extracted from it which indicated that the strain has no 
biodegradation of plasmid in its cell (data not shown). 
No laccase activity was detected from the strain (data 
not shown). The dye-biodegradation mechanism was still 
under investigation.
The dye-decolorization is the key step in dye-polluted 
water treatment. The strain B. amyloliquefaciens  W36 could 
decolorize various dyes efficiently under optimized condi-
tions. Compared with the decolorization strain discovered 
in this species, B. amyloliquefaciens W36 could decolorize 
four different dyes efficiently and do not produce laccase. It 
indicated that the decolorization mechanism was different 
from the reported strains (Lončar et al. 2013; Wang et al. 
2017). Because of the complicate dye structures, each of 
the bacteria cannot decolorize all types of dyes (Kuhad et al. 
2004). We need to find more and more strains with strong 
ability to be used in dye polluted wastewater treatment. The 
strain may have practical application for the biological puri-
fication of dye-containing wastewater.Acknowledgements  This work was financially supported by the Basic
