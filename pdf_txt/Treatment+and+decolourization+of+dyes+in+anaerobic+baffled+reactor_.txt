Abstract 
      
Wastewater from the textile i ndustry can contain a variety of polluting subst-an ces including 
dyes. Increasingly, environmental legislation is be ing imposed to control th e release of dyes, in 
particular azo-based compounds, into the enviro  -nment. The ability of microorganisms to 
decolourise and metabolise dyes has long been  known, and the use of bioremediation based 
technologies for treating textile wastewater has attracted interest. With in this review, we 
investigate the mechan-isms by which diverse cat egories of microorganisms, such as fungi, 
bacterial consortia and y east, bring about the degradation of dyestuffs.

1. Introduction  
Textile industries are found in most countries an d their numbers have in creased. These industries 
have shown a significant increase in the use of synthetic comple x organic dyes as the colouring 
material. The annual world production of tex tiles is about 30 million tonnes requiring 700,000 
tonnes of different dyes (Zollinger,19-87) whic h causes considerable environmental pollution 
pro-blems. Dyes include a broad spectrum of different chemical structures, primarily based on 
substituted aromatic and heterocyclic groups such as aromatic amine (C6 H5 -NH2 ), which is a 
suspected carcinogen, phenyl (C 6 H5 -CH2 ) and naphthyle (NO2  -OH), the only thing in 
common is their ability to absorb  light in the visible region. A large number of dyes are azo 
compounds (-N-N-), which are linked by an azo bridge.  
Colour is the first contaminant to be recognized  in wastewater and has to be removed before 
discharging into waterbodies or  on land. The presence of very small amounts of dyes in water 
(less than1 ppm for some dyes)  is highly visible and affects the aesthetic merit, water 
transparency and gas solu-bility in lakes, rivers  and other waterbodies. The removal of colour 
from wastewaters is often more important than  the removal of the soluble colourless organic 
substances, which usually contribute the major fraction of the biochemical oxygen 
demand(BOD). Methods for the removal of BOD from  most effluents are fa irly well established; 
dyes, however, are more difficult to  treat because of their synthe tic origin and mainly complex 
aromatic molecular structures. Government legi slation is becoming more  stringent in most 
developed countries regarding the removal of dyes  from industrial effluents. Recently, state and 
federal agencies in the USA ha ve been requiring lower effluent colour limits (< 200 units of 
American Dye Manufacturers Inst itute, ADMI) (McCurdy et al.,1992). 
The wastewater characteristics from a dye house are highly variable from  day to day, depending 
on the type of dye, the type of fabric and the concentration of the agents added. Treatment of 
such wastewaters is therefore, essential but di†cult. The discha rge of dye house wastewater into  10-2the environment is aesthetically displeasing, impe des light penetration, damages the quality of 
the receiving streams and may be  toxic to treatment processes, to food chain organisms and to 
aquatic life. The degradation of molecules of  dyes in the environment by microorganisms is 
likely to be slow (Meyer, 1981), which means that it is possible for high levels of dye to persist, 
and potentially accumulate. Furthermore, any degradation that does occur may produce smaller 
molecules equally unfamiliar to the environment, such as amines, and which may also be toxic. There is no universal method for the removal of colour from dye waste (McCurdy et al.), the 
alternatives depend upon the type of dye wastewat er. As the characteristics of dye wastewater 
are very variable, many different physical, chemi cal and biological treatme nt methods have been 
employed for its treatment. The physical and chemical techniques were  numerous including anion exchange resins (Karcher  
et al, 2002),  flotation(Lin & Lin, 1993), electrofl otation(Ogfitveren & Koparal, 1994), 
electrochemical destruction(Ulke r & Savas, 1994), irradiation ( Shen  et al, 2002) , 
ozonation(Zhang et al, 2003), ad sorption(El-Gundi, 1991) and  the use of activated carbon (Pala 
et al, 2002), etc. Some of physi cal and chemical treatment techni ques are effective for colour 
removal but use more energy and chemicals than bi ological processes. They also concentrate the 
pollution into solid or liquid side streams requiring additi onal treatment or disposal.  In recent 
years,  a number of studies have focused on some microorganism which are to biodegrade and 
biosorb dye in wastewaters. Awide  variety of micro -organisms capable of declorizing a wide 
range of dyes include some bacteria, fungi, yeast. This paper summarizes microbical declorization of  dye used in textile industries, reports on 
progress and discusses mechanisms and the factors affecting the process. 
 
2. Microbial decolorization 
 
2.1 Biodegradation 
  2.1.1 Fungal biodegradition   White-rot fungi are those organisms that are able  to degrade lignin, the structural polymer found 
in woody plants (Barr and Aust, 1994).  The most widely studied wh ite-rot fungus, in regards to 
xenobiotic degradation, is Phanerochaete chrysosporium . This fungus is capable of degrading 
dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and other chloro-organics ( Reddy, 1995).   In addition 
to P. chrysosporium , other white-rot fungi, also capable of decolo rizing dyes, include  Coriolus 
versicolor (Sam et al, 2001 ),Trametes versicolor  (Wong and Yu, 1999; Libra et al 2003) , 
Coriolus versicolor  (Knapp and Newby, 1999)  and Funalia trogii  (Yesilada et al., 1995) . 
Meanwhile, there are vari ous fungi other than wh ite-rot fungi, such as umbelopsis isabellina  and 
penicillium geastrivous (Yang et al, 2003), aspergillus foetidus,  Rhizopus oryzae  (Polman and 
Breckenridge, 1996)  which can also decolorize and/or  biosorb diverse dyes. In fungal 
decolorization of dye wastewater, these fungi can be classified in to two kinds according to their 
life state: living cells to biodegr ade and biosorb dyes and dead cells  (fungal biomass) to adsorb 
dyes.  For living cells, the major mechanism is biod egradation because they can produce the lignin 
modifying enzymes, laccase, manganese peroxi dase (MnP) and lignin peroxidase (LiP) to 
mineralize synthetic lignin or dyes ( Raghukumar et al., 1996; Fu and Viraraghavan,  2001 ). 
However, the relative contributi ons of LiP, MnP and laccase to  the decolorization of dyes may  10-3be different for each fungus. For the fungus P. chrysosporium , LiP was found to be responsible 
for the decolorization of the dyes (Pasti-Grigsby et al., 1992 ). Ollikka et al. (1993) reported that 
LiP played a major role in the decolorization of azo, triphenyl methane, heterocyclic and 
polymeric dyes by P. chrysosporium  and that MnP was not required to start the degradation of 
these dyes. Young and Yu (1997) st udied the decolorization of the eight synthetic dyes, 
including azo, anthraquinone, metal complex and indigo, by T. versicolor  and also reported that 
MnP did not decolorize these dyes while ligninase -catalyzed oxidation re moved over 80% of the 
dyes. However, Zhang et al. (1999)  observed that MnP played an important role in the 
decolorization of cotton bleaching effluent by an  unidentified white-rot fungus, while there was 
no obvious role for LiP in this decolorization. Because T. versicolor  releases laccase as its major 
extracellular enzyme, its major mechanism in decolorizing anthraquinone, azo and indigo dyes 
was laccase activity (Wong and Yu, 1999 ).  
 Fungal decolorization is a promising alternative to replace or supplement present treatment processes. However, using fungal biomass to rem ove color in a dye wastew ater is still in the 
research stage. More studies are needed  to develop a practical application. 
 2.1.2  Bacteria biodegradation  Efforts to isolate bacterial cultures capable of degrading azo dyes st arted in the 1970s with 
reports of a bacillus subtilis (Horitsu et al., 1977), follo wed by numerous bacteria:  pseudomonas 
spp were isolated from an anaer obic-aerobic dyeing house wastewater  treatment facility as the 
most active azo-dye degraders( Yu et al, 2001) ; Chang et al(2004) used the extracellular 
metabolites of a dye-decolorizing strain, Escherichia coli strain NO3 , as a biostimulator to entice 
E. coli strain NO3 into a beneficial mode of metabolism for an economically feasible 
decolorization.To design technical decolorization processes of tex tile wastewater treatment with 
sulfide produced by Sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB ) was designed to decolorize  textile 
wastewater treatment with sulfide(Yoo, 2002) 
 In general, the wastewater from textile in dustry contains many various dyes. To gain a 
widespread reception, the azo-degrading bacteria should exhibit decolorizing ability for a wide 
range of dyes, aeromonas hydrophila  was selecte from six bacterial strains with the capability of 
degrading textile dyes (Chen et al, 2003). Isolati ng such microorganisms proved to be a difficult 
task. Mixed bacterial cultures from a wide variet y of habitats have also been shown to 
decolourise the diazolinked ch romophore of dye molecules in 15 days (Knapp and Newby, 
1995). Nigam and Marchant (1995) a nd Nigam et al. (1996) demonstr ated that a mixture of dyes 
were decolourised by anaerobic bacteria in 24-30 h, using free growing cells or in the form of 
biofilms on various support materials. The ability of bacteria to metabolise azo dyes ha s been investigated by a number of research 
groups. Under aerobic conditions azo dyes are not readily metabolised, the intermediates formed 
by these degradative steps resulted  in disruption of metabolic pathways and the dyes were not 
actually mineralised. Under anae robic conditions, such as anoxi c sediments, many bacteria 
gratuitously reduce azo dyes reportedly by the activity of unspecific, soluble, cytoplasmic 
reductases, known as azo reductases. These enzy mes are reported to resu lt in the production of 
colorless aromaticamines which may be toxic, mutagenic, and possibly carcinogenic to animals 
(Mcmulan et al, 2001).  2.1.3 Yeast biodegradation  10-4Only a limited amount of studies about yeast d ecolorization were reported.  The ability of 
Kluyveromyces marxianus IMB3  to decolorize Remazol Black-B dye was investigated and 
maximum colour removal, 98%, was achieved at 37 degrees C(Meehan et al, 2000). Zissi et al. 
(1997) showed that Bacillus subtilis  could be used to break down azo dye. A number of simple 
azo dyes was degraded in liquid aerated batc h cultures by a strain of the yeast Candida 
zeylanoides, the extent of colour  removal ranged from 44 to 90%, after 7 days (Martins et al. 
1999)   2.2 Microbial biosorption 
 The uptake or accumulation of chemicals by microb ial mass has been termed biosorption (Hu, 
199 and Kumar et al., 1998 ). Bacteria and fungi have a ll been used for the purpose of 
decolourising dye-containing effluents.  Knapp et al. (1995)  reported that the extent of color 
removal by adsorption was always limited, generally less than 50%.  Benito et al. (1997) studied 
color adsorption by T. versicolor  mycelium and reported that th e adsorption accounted for only 
5–10% of the total color rem oval. Miranda et al. (1996)  observed that the per centage of adsorbed 
color was in the range 10–25 in the study with Aspergillus niger . Hu (1992) demonstrated the 
ability of bacterial cells to adsorb  reactive dyes. Zhou and Zimmerman (1993)  used actinomyces 
as an adsorbent for decolourisation of efflue nts containing anthroquinone, phalocyanine and azo 
dyes. The decolorization of dyes with  different molecular structures by Cunninghamella elegans  
was evaluated under several media condition( Ambrosio et al, 2004).  Three reactive dyes were 
rapidly adsorbed by the mycelium pellets of Pe nicillium oxalicum. Dye removal of Reactive 
Blue 19 was up to 60% in 10 min and 91% in 80  min( Zhang et al 2003). Depending on the dye 
and the species of micro-organism used different  binding rates and capaci ties were observed. It 
can be said that certain dyes have  a particular affinity for bindi ng with microbial species. The use 
of biomass has its advantages, es pecially if the dye-containing e ffluent is very toxic. Biomass 
adsorption is effective when conditions are not always favourable for the growth and 
maintenance of the microbial population. Adso rption by biomass occurs by ion exchange. 
 2.3  Proccess influence factors   In the decolorization process by fungi, bacteria and yeast, there are vari ous influencing factors. 
They can be grouped into two kinds : one is related to microbial growth conditions; the other is 
related to the characteristics of the dye solution or wastewater.  2.3.1 Microbial growth contitions  As different components possess differ ent abilities to decolorize dyes, it is necessary to create an 
optimal environment favorable to microbial gr owth and thus make the microbial possess the 
maximum ability to decolorize dyes in wastewat er. Important microbial growth conditions are 
discussed as follows: Medium, fungi are mostly grown in a medium with dyes or dye wast ewater to develop a 
biosorbent containing living fungi . The medium is mainly compos ed of carbon source, nitrogen 
source and other nutrients;Carbon, all kinds of carbon resource were investigated how they effect 
the decolorization.(Z hang et al. 1999; Belsare and Prasad 1988; Mou et al., 1991);Oxygen,Soares 
and Duran (1998) reported that agitation was essential for keeping a high rate of decolorization  10-5by T. villosa ; Nitrogen(Zhen and Yu, 1998),  Nutrient concentrations, incubation  time(Sumathi 
and Phatak, 1999), pH and tempreture were also studied as parameters, mycelium pellets 
obtained the maximum adsorption( zhang et al, 2003)at pH 2.  
 2.3.2 Characteristics of dye wastewater  Dyes,  Different dyes have diffe rent molecular structures. So a mi crobial capable of decolorizing 
one dye may have different capacities for other dyes( Wong and Yu, 1999; Knapp et al. 1995; 
and Paszcczynski et al. 1992).  
Dyeing processes consume large amounts of salt, so the concentrations of sa lt in dye wastewaters 
are normally high. Mou et al. (1991) s tudied samples from a textile  dyeing factory wastewater 
with as high as 15% (w/v) chloride ion. So ionic strength is an important factor. 
Zhou(1 991)reported that high ionic stre ngth (the concentration of NaCl) led to high biosorption 
of humic acid by R. arrhizus . The effect of ionic strength was similar to that of a colloid. At 
higher ionic strength, the el ectrical double layers of both R. arrhizus  biomass and humic acid 
would be compressed thinner. Therefore biomass a nd humic acid could approach closer and thus 
this would increase van der Waals bonding and hence increase biosorption. Tempreture, as 
various textile and other dye e ffluents are produced at relative ly high temperatures (50–60°C) 
(Banat et al., 1996) , so temperature will be an important  factor in the r eal application of 
biosorption by biomass in future.  
There are various factors influe ncing microbial decolorization re lated to microbial growth and 
the characteristics of dye wastewater. Dye mo lecules have many different and complicated 
structures. This is one of the most important f actors influencing microbial  decolorization. Further 
research is needed to establish the relationshi ps between dye molecule structure and microbial 
decolorization
.  
3. Textile-dye bioremediation system 
3.1 Aerobic system 
The recalcitrant nature of zero dyes, together with  their toxicity to mircrooganism, makes aerobic 
treatment difficult.Therefore,especi ally for color removal,various adsorbents and chemicals have 
been directly added into the activated sludge syst ems in certain studies.In  such a study, (Marquez 
and Costa obtained 90%acid oran ge 7 dye removal effciency  was obtained by addition of 
activated carbon into th e aeration tank ( Marquez and Costa, 1996).It was also determined that 
the increase in activated carbon particle size decr eases color removal effciency .In another study, 
the addition of  activated carbon was investigat ed and color removaleffciencies for different 
kinds of dyes were determined (Marmagne and Costa   1996). A  speci fc organic focculant 
(Marwichem DEC), powdered activated carbon (P AC),bentonite,activated clay and commercial 
synthetic inorganic clay (Macros orb)were directly added into the activated sludge laboratory 
pilot plant model.(Pala, et al, 2002). 
 
3.2  Anaerobic system   Under anaerobic conditions, azo dyes are readily cl eaved via a  four-electron reduction at the  10-6azo linkage generating aromatic amines. The required electrons are provided by electron 
donating carbon source such as starch, volatile fatty  acids (VFA) or glouse. In addition , it is 
known that methanogenic and acetogenic bacteria  in anaerobic microbial consortium contain 
unique reduced enzyme cofactors that could also potentially re duce azo bonds( Carliell et al, 
1996). Among the many anaerobic systems available are: Baffled reactor                  Bell et al (2000) 
UASB                               Chinwekitvanich  et al (2000) Anaerobic filter reactor     Basibuyuk (1997) UAF                                  Oxspring (1996) FBR                                   Sen et al (2003)  3.3  Aerobic/anaerobic system  Dye colour is sensitive to redox and anaerobic treatments are eff ective at decolourising reactive 
azo dyes (Beydilli, et al). Azo dyes account for about two-thirds of the dye catalogue  Anaerobic 
cleavage of the azo bond (---N=N-- -) results in permanent decolour isation of the dye, but the 
intermediates can be reox idised to coloured  by-products. Specif ic azo reductase enzymes are also 
reported. The aromatic amine residues from anaerobic decol ourisation resist furthe r anaerobic degradation 
and they are also reported mutagens, but they ca n be mineralised aerobically . Many researches 
reports on the advantages of cocultures of anae robic and aerobic organi sms in sequential redox 
environments for the treatment of refractory COD.  A great number of the reported examples of 
azo dye biodegradation comprise two main step s, the reductive cleavage of the azo bond under 
anaerobic conditions and the subsequent aerobic mineralization of the produced aromatic amines.

4. CONCLUSION 
 
Coloured-dye-wastewater treatment and decoloriza tion presents an arduous task. Wide ranges of 
pH, salt concentrations and chemical structures  often add to the complication. Among the most 
economically viable choices av ailable for effluent  treatme nt/decolorization, and the most 
practical in terms of manpower requirements a nd running expenses to adopt and develop, appear 
to be the  biological systems.  Fungal , bacter ia and yeast  decolorizations are a promising 
alternative to replace or s upplement present treatment pro cesses. The techniques by which 
decolorization occurs vary and among them adso rption seems of great significance for future 
development in bio-removal or bio-recovery of  dye. However, using microbial biomass to 
remove color in a dye wastewater is still in the research stage. More concerted efforts are still 
required to establish  biologi cal decolorization systems.   10-7Ambrosio, S.T., Campos-Takaki G.M., 2004.  Decolorization of reactive azo dyes by
