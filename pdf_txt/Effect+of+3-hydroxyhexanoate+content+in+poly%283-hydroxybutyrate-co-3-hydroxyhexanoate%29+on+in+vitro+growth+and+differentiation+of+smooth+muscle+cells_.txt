1. INTRODUCTION 
Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) are a family of bio-
polymers consisting of polyesters of many different hy-
droxycarboxylic acid molecules. Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-
co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) (PHBHHx) is one of the few PHA 
molecules that can currently be produced on a scale large 
enough for use in both scientific research and medical de-
vice construction [1]. It is the designation of molecules 
consisting of random co-polymers of 3-hydroxybutyrate and 3-hydroxyhexanoate [2]. A co-polyester consisting of 
3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) and 3-hydroxyhexanoate (3HHx) 
can be synthesized by Aeromonas hydrophila strain 4AK4 
with long-chain fatty acids as the carbon source [3, 4]. 
PHBHHx has good physical, chemical and mechanical 
properties [5-7], making it potentially useful for a wide range of biomaterials applications. In addition, it has also 
shown better biocompatibility with different cell types, 
such as smooth-muscle cells [8], fibroblasts [9], chondro-cytes [10], osteoblasts [2] and bone marrow cells [11]. 
PHBHHX plays a significant role in the field of biomedical 
materials and has become a popular research field in recent years. In this paper, we will review this new material in 
biomedical tissue engineering research.

2.1. Biodegradation  
In tissue-engineering applications, it is desirable to match 
the rate of absorption of the scaffolds with biological tissue 
treatment periods. During treatment, the scaffolds must 
maintain their original mechanical properties and other vari-ous functions to play a supportive role in induced tissue 
growth. After treatment, the best scaffolds will degrade as 
soon as possible, absorbed by the body to reduce side-
effects. Treatment cycles vary in different biological tissues 
in the human body. For example, skin tissue takes only 3 to 
10 days, visceral tissue takes 1 to 2 months, while the major 
organs may require more than 6 months to degrade. In an in 
vitro  degradation test [12] of the 3HHx content of 0%, 5%, 
12% and 20% in four types of PHBHHX, the material con-taining 12% HHx PHBHHX showed the fastest degradation: 
After 50 days, the weight reduction was 7%, and sustained 
weight loss was observed. While the other three materials’ 
weight reduction reached only about 3% after 50 days, and 
sustained weight loss was not observed. PHBHHx could be 
considered as being similar to polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), which is a compact right-handed helix stabilized by car-
bonyl–methyl group interaction. It represents one of the few 
exceptions of a helix found in nature which does not depend 
on hydrogen bonding for its formation and stability [13]. 
Based on this structure, the high HHx content in PHBHHx 
increases the number of methyl groups compared with the increase of carbonyl groups in the polymer; at the same time, 
it decreases the oxygen-containing moieties on the polymer 
surface [8].

Typically, the smaller blending modification of the 
polymer chain, so commonly used, was chemically modified to change the performance of the degradation of the material. In the study by Shangguan et al.  [14], an ultraviolet (UV) 
radiation method was developed to achieve controlled degra-
dation for bacterial biopolyester PHBHHx. In comparison, 
the PHBHHx films subjected to direct UV radiation became very brittle, although their degradation was faster than that of the PHBHHx powders subjected to direct UV radiation. Af-ter 15 weeks of degradation in simulated body fluid (SBF), films prepared from 8 and 16h UV-treated PHBHHx pow-
ders maintained 92% and 87% of their original weights, re-
spectively, while the untreated PHBHHx films lost only 1% 
of their weight. In general, UV-treated PHBHHx powder had 
a broad Mw distribution that contributed to rapid degrada-
tion, due to dissolution of low-Mw polymer fragments, and strong mechanical properties due to high-Mw polymer 
chains. 
Physical and chemical methods could control PHBHHx 
degradation to match the periods needed to build the tissues and organs for treatment. 
PHB, the component of PHBHHx, is a normal ingredient 
of blood. Oligomeric-3HB is the main degradation product 
present in the cell membranes of eukaryotes. Investigation of 
the degradation products of PHAs, especially the oligomers, 
which are not harmful to the cells and surrounding tissues, is important. In a study by Yang and co-workers [15], the in 
vitro  effects of oligo(3-hydroxybutyrate) (OHB), oligo(3-
hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate) (O3HB4HB) and 
oligo(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) (OHBHHx) 
on growth and differentiation of the murine beta cell line 
NIT-1 were investigated. Among the three oligo-
hydroxyalkanoates (oligo-HAs), cells treated with OHBHHx 
displayed higher viability, as measured by the CCK-8 assay. 
The results demonstrated that the degradation products of PHAs, especially OHBHHx from PHBHHx, were not harm-
ful to beta cells. 
2.2. Hydrophilicity 
The hydrophilicity of the material was examined by 
measurement of the contact angle to water. Considerable 
research has shown that the surface properties of a biomate-
rial, especially its hydrophilicity, influence cell adhesion and 
proliferation [16-18]. Wang et al.  [9] reported that, with in-
creasing HHx content in PHBHHx, contact angles increased 
from 68° to 85°, indicating a decreasing hydrophilicity on 
the polymer surface, while changing HHx content from 5% 
to 20% did not lead to dramatic changes in surface hydro-philicity. All PHBHHx and PHB were more hydrophobic 
than polylactic acid (PLA). Sun et al.  [19] measured the wa-
ter contact angle, and surface-free energy analysis showed 
that the silk fibroin is adsorbed into the surface of the 
PHBHHX. The water contact angle of the material surface is 
reduced from 90° to 51°, and the surface-free energy in-
creased from 37.9mJ/m
2 to 57.4mJ/m2. Hydrophilicity im-
proved with the addition of polycaprolactone (PCL) [20]. 
PHBHHx/PCL testing by accelerated hydrolytic studies has indicated that a 30/70 blend exhibited similar degradation 
behavior to PCL in terms of changes in crystallinity, molecu-
lar weight, morphology and mass loss. 2.3. Mechanical Properties 
Scaffolds for tissue engineering, in addition to the re-
quirements of good biocompatibility and biodegradability, 
must also induce cell adsorption and promote tissue growth, 
contribute good mechanical properties and match adjacent tissue. Scaffolds can be used to meet the requirements of the 
defect in terms of mechanical support and morphology be-
fore new tissue matures. Chen’s study [21] researched the 
mechanical properties of solution-cast P(3HB-co-3") films. 
The tensile strength of the films decreased from 43 to 20 
MPa as the 3HH fraction was increased from 0 to 17mol %. 
In contrast, the elongation to break increased from 6 to 
850%. This result indicates that the P(3HB-co-3") films be-
come soft and flexible with an increase in the 3HH fraction. 
However, its brittleness and degradation characteristics 
can be improved upon by blending with other biomaterials. 
Enhanced yield strength, yield strain and Young's modulus of solvent-blended PHBHHx/PCL occurred at a 30/70 blend 
when compared with PHBHHx and PCL [20]. 
2.4. Surface Properties 
Surface properties including hydroph ilicity, surface ap-
pearance and functional groups were characterized by water 
contact angle measurement, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Most polymer materials show poor cell adhesion properties due to their low surface energy, chemical inertness and smooth sur-
face. For this reason, it is crucial for polymeric films in-
tended for biomedical applications to be surface-modified by 
additional treatments to raise surface bioactivity, thus en-hancing hydrophilic as well as adhesive properties.  
Surface properties of PHBHHx consisting of different 
HHx contents were investigated. It was found that increasing 
HHx content in PHBHHx changed the properties of polymer 
surfaces, including polymer crystallinity [21], surface rough-
ness and surface hydrophilicity. These changes were interde-
pendent. For example, the discrepancy in the surface mor-phology of PHB and PHBHHx may be a major reason for 
their different contact angles [22]. With the increased HHx 
content in PHBHHx, the polymer surface properties changed accordingly. P(HB-co-20%-HHx) had the smoothest surface, 
while the PHB surface was most hydrophilic among the 
evaluated PHB and all the PHBHHx. With increasing HHx content, PHBHHx films became less porous on the surface. 
When HHx content increased to 20%, a dramatic change in 
the surface topology of PHBHHx was observed [9]. 
2.5. Modification of Properties 
Several tissues and organs in the human body have dif-
ferent anatomical and physiological features, so it is difficult to meet their requirements by relying on a scaffold made of a single material. To make PHBHHx able to adapt to more requirements and have better biocompatibility, scientists use a variety of methods to modify the material. Different char-
acteristics of the materials are mixed to yield scaffolds with 
new levels of performance. Techniques used to modify mate-rial properties include surface hydrolysis [23], grafting tech-nique [24], ultraviolet treatment [14] and plasma treatment [25, 26]. Additives might have a positive impact on the deg-Properties and Applications of PHBHHx Current Stem Cell Research & Therapy, 2014 , Vol. 9, No. 3    217 
radation of the material, or the final degradation products 
will be toxic to the tissue.  
To enhance the thermal physical properties of PHBHHx, 
Luo and co-workers blended PHBHHx with poly(3-
hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate) (P3HB4HB) [27]. All PHBHHx/P3HB4HB blends showed improved physical 
properties compared with those of PHBHHx, including 
higher thermal stability, flexibility and mechanical strength. The PHBHHx/P3HB4HB blend in a 4:2 weight ratio showed 
the roughest surface and also had the highest chondrocyte 
viability among all blends. 
Shen et al.  [28] fabricated the PHBHHx film by a solu-
tion-casting method that was subsequently modified by 
NaOH treatment to improve surface hydrophilic properties. The results showed that the hydrophilicity of PHBHHx film 
was obviously improved by the NaOH treatment, due to the 
topographic changes promoted by NaOH-etching and the 
introduction of polar groups, including hydroxyl and car-
boxyl, on the topmost surface layers. However, the modified 
film exhibited an aging effect: the hydrophilicity decreased 
with time elapsed during storage. It was found that the aging 
rate was strongly dependent on both the crystallinity of the 
film and the storage environment. 
Surface modification can also change the properties’ 
modification of PHBHHx. The water contact angle was de-creased dramatically compared with that of NaOH- or lipase-treated PHBHHx films and untreated PHBHHx films, and 
the number of attached neural stem cells (NSC) significantly 
increased. NSCs survived well on treated PHBHHx films 
and differentiated into neurons and glial cells. 
2.6. Cytocompatibility 
PHBHHx has excellent cell compatibility with a variety 
of primary cells and cell lines such as cartilage cells [29], 
bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells [30], adipose-
derived stem cells [31], fibroblasts [32] and osteoblasts [9]. 
The behaviors of cells differed on PHBHHx. The highly 
porous electrospun PHBHHx membranes are better sub-strates for the culturing of human mesenchymal stem cells 
(hMSCs), since they can maintain cell viability higher than 
that of the compression-molded PHBHHx membranes [30].  
Also, different cells had different responses to the mate-
rials. For fibroblasts, the smoothest P(HB-co-20%-HHx) was 
preferred, while for osteoblasts, the P(HB-co-12%-HHx) surface with appropriate roughness was the most favorable. 
This roughness may also promote osteoblast differentiation, 
indicated by round cells on the P(HB-co-12%-HHx) surface, which indicated activated osteoblasts [9]. 
Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), spontaneously 
differentiated hESCs (SDhESCs) and mesenchymal stem 
cells (hMSCs) co-culture with PHBHHx and collagen. Fol-
lowing exposure to the appropriate induction medium [33], those three groups were shown to promote retention of os-
teogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic differentiation by the 
expression of RUNX2, SOX9 and PPAR/g1 genes, respec-
tively. This suggests that PHBHHx/collagen scaffolds have 
the potential for use as biocompatible scaffolds in future 
tissue engineering. 3. PHBHHX APPLICATIONS IN TISSUE ENGINEER-
ING 
3.1. Bone Tissue Engineering 
In general, bone tissue engineering scaffolds must have 
the features described above to be considered useful. They 
must be biocompatible, support cell growth, guide and orga-
nize the cells, allow for tissue ingrowth and, ultimately, de-grade to non-toxic products [34]. Currently, investigators have conducted considerable research on bone tissue engi-
neering scaffolds, and many experimentally validated scaf-folds have greatly promoted the development of bone tissue 
engineering, but the ideal scaffold for bone tissue engineer-
ing requirements has not been identified. In recent years, much has been achieved with the use of PHBHHX in the bone tissue engineering field. 
Recently, 3D porous scaffolds loaded with specific living 
cells have been investigated for natural tissue regeneration. 
Xi et al.  [35] blended PHBHHx-hydroxyapatite (HAP) com-
posite scaffolds prepared by phase separation and subsequent sublimation of the solvent for bone tissue engineering. The HAP platelets, ranging from 10 to 100mm in size, were ran-domly distributed in the PHBHHx matrix. Good adhesion 
between PHBHHx matrix and HAP platelets was observed. 
Compared with those of the PHBHHx scaffolds, both the 
compressive modulus and the maximum stress of the com-
posite scaffold were significantly higher. Biocompatibility and osteoconductivity were assessed by examination of the morphology, proliferation and differentiation of MC3T3-E1 
osteoprogenitor cells seeded on the scaffolds. The PHBHHx-
HAP composite scaffolds showed better mechanical proper-
ties, biocompatibility and osteoconductivity than the 
PHBHHx scaffolds. However, studies by Wang and co-
workers [36] yielded opposite results, perhaps due to differ-ent preparation methods for scaffold materials with different 
properties, among other factors.  
For bone tissue engineering, electrospinning techniques 
have been used in recent years to create fibrous scaffolds 
[37]. Microgrooved topography (10 /g70m) on PHBHHx sur-
faces was proved to promote initial osteogenesis of MSCs 
[38]. As reported, the aligned PHBHHx electrospun fibers 
impaired adipogenic but enhanced osteogenic differentiation 
in the absence of soluble inductive factors [39]. The MAPK-
dependent PPAR signaling pathway was responsible for the 
influence of fiber alignment on MSCs. 
3.2. Cartilage Tissue Engineering 
Adult articular cartilage contains no blood vessels, neural 
network or lymphatic drainage and has a limited intrinsic 
capacity to heal once damaged by injury or disease [40]. To 
repair damaged cartilage, many researchers are turning to-
ward tissue engineering approaches involving the fabrication 
of cartilage constructs by culturing cells on porous and re-
sorbable scaffolds [41, 42]. 
PHB/PHBHHx is a suitable material for cartilage tissue 
engineering [31]. The mRNA level of type II collagen of 
chondrocytes seeded on all scaffolds consisting of PHBHHx 
was obviously higher than that of the PHB-only scaffold throughout the culture period, suggesting the positive effect of PHBHHx on extracellular matrix production [29]. Human 218    Current Stem Cell Research & Therapy, 2014 , Vol. 9, No. 3  Yang et al. 
adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) were grown on a three-
dimensional PHB/PHBHHx scaffold in vitro  with or without 
chondrogenic media for 14 days [31]. The differentiated cells grown on the (PHB/PHBHHx) scaffold were then implanted into the subcutaneous layer of nude mice. After 24 weeks of 
implantation, the differentiated cells/(PHB/PHBHHx) im-
plants formed cartilage-like tissue and stained positive for collagen type II, safranin O and toluidine blue. In addition, typical cartilage lacuna was observed, and there were no remnants of PHB/PHBHHx [31]. 
Three-dimensional scaffolds made of PHBHHx have 
been used to repair a rabbit articular cartilage defect model 
[40]. After 16 weeks of in vivo  implantation, the defects in 
both the engineered cartilage constructs and the bare scaf-
folds were found to be filled with white cartilaginous tissue, 
with the engineered constructs showing histologically good 
subchondral bone connection and better surrounding carti-
lage infusion. More accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM), including type II collagen and sGAG, was achieved in the engineered cartilage constructs. The repaired tissues possessed an average compressive modulus of 1.58MPa. 
3.3. Tendon Tissue Engineering 
Tendon tissue is characterized by poor repair following 
injury or disease, with the majority of tendon ruptures occur-
ring at the midpoint of the Achilles tendon, which is rela-
tively acellular [43]. Tenocytes are the major cell group pre-sent in tendons, constituting around 95% of the cellular mass 
[44]. Tenocytes can adhere to and spread across PHBHHx 
films over 24-hours/day time periods [45]. 
For tendon injuries and defects, there are, at present, no 
synthetic/biosynthesized implants available that can restore 
full function or match the mechanical properties of native 
tendon [46]. Therefore, PHBHHx was investigated for its 
utility as a scaffold in a rat Achilles tendon repair model [47]. An accelerated return of function was observed when compared with that in control, with no prolonged immu-nological or inflammatory response in the rat model ob-served over 40 days. It was also shown that cells not only migrated into the PHBHHx–collagen core, but also that im-planted tenocytes became organized along the fiber surface 
within the PHBHHx fiber–collagen core in vivo . This result 
demonstrated that PHBHHx in conjunction with collagen 
and tenocytes can be used as a scaffold material for the 
treatment of damaged tendon tissue in vivo . 
3.4. Vascular Tissue Engineering 
Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of high mortality 
rates [48], usually considered as a surgical treatment for 
patch-filled, reorganization or defective angiogenesis [49]. 
Ideal cardiovascular patch material should be resistant to 
degradation and infection, non-toxic and non-immunogenic, 
have good plasticity and good scalability and be durable over 
the long term [50, 51]. PHBHHx can be an ideal material for 
use in cardiovascular tissue engineering. 
The study by Qu and co-workers [8] study revealed that 
PHBHHX has functions that induced vascular-related cells. 
Results demonstrated that RaSMCs adhered better to 
PHBHHx containing 12% HHx (12%HHx), although they 
proliferated better on 20% HHx-containing PHBHHx films (20%HHx). This was explained by the difference in cell-
cycle progression observed by flow cytometry, since it was found that only 20%HHx-containing polymer could maintain normal cell-cycle evolution as TCPs did after 3-day incuba-tion. 
Qu’s team further investigated the effects of PHBHHX 
on vascular-related cells by surface modification [52]. The improved results were demonstrated by better growth of hu-man umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and rabbit 
aorta smooth-muscle cells (SMCs) on the surface of ammo-
nia plasma-treated PHBHHx coated with fibronectin (PFn-
PHBHHx), compared with that on fibronectin-coated (Fn-
PHBHHx) or uncoated PHBHHx. The most prominent effect 
of PFn-PHBHHx was its stimulation of HUVEC prolifera-
tion. HUVECs on PFn-PHBHHx formed a confluent mono-
layer after 3 days of incubation, while SMCs were unable to 
form a sub-confluent layer. 
To overcome the deficiencies of heart valve fillings, an 
acellular porcine aortic valve was prepared as a scaffold by coating a composite valve PHBHHx patch [53]. Mechanical testing in in vitro  experiments showed that, through 
PHBHHx coating, the tensile strength of the composite valve 
was increased. In an in vivo  study, hybrid valve conduits 
were implanted into pulmonary positions in sheep without cardiopulmonary bypass. The valves were explanted and examined histologically and biochemically 16 weeks after surgery. These results showed that, in vivo,  PHBHHx coating 
can reduce calcification and promote the repopulation of 
hybrid valves with the recipient's cells, resembling native valve tissue. 
Uniaxial microtubular structures made of PHBHHx were 
successfully prepared by directional freezing and phase-
separation techniques [54]. The structure of the scaffolds 
included tubular size and architecture. The scaffold’s me-chanical properties could be adjusted by changing the PHBHHx concentration, PHBHHx solvent and phase-
separation temperature. These special structures guided the 
rabbit aorta smooth-muscle cells (RaSMCs) to grow along 
the tubular structure. Scanning electron microscopy and 
H&E staining demonstrated that RaSMCs were guided to 
grow along the microtubular structures of scaffolds prepared from the 2.5% or 3.0% PHBHHx/benzene solution. 
Currently, PHBHHx and other polymeric materials in 
cardiovascular tissue engineering applications are still facing challenges, mainly application compatibility issues [55]. An 
electro-spinning technique [56] and a 3D weaving technique 
[57] have been developed to prepare polymers with suitable mechanical properties. We have reason to believe that the 
adoption of a new PHBHHx production preparation process, as well as an appropriately modified PHBHHx surface, will further improve its bio-mechanical properties, resulting in 
wide use in cardiovascular tissue engineering. 
3.5. Nerve Tissue Engineering 
In recent years, the clinical peripheral nerve injury repair 
technique has continued to rely on the autologous transplant method, but this method has many disadvantages, such as the need for the tissue engineering of a single nerve [58]. With the development of tissue engineering, the more synthetic 
neural tube is used for the repair of peripheral nerve injury.Properties and Applications of PHBHHx Current Stem Cell Research & Therapy, 2014 , Vol. 9, No. 3    219

An ideal neural tube should be able to play a protective role 
in injured nerves and can also promote axonal growth [59]. As a new generation of PHA polymers, PHBHHx usage has been considered a good application in nerve tissue engineer-ing, due to its excellent mechanical and biological properties.  
PHBVHHx scaffolds with pore sizes of 30-60 microns 
increased the differentiation of hBMSCs into nerve cells, whereas they decreased cell proliferation. Results indicated that PHBVHHx scaffolds could be used in nerve tissue engi-
neering for the treatment of nerve injury [60]. 
Three PHAs including PHBHHx verified that the materi-
als supported neural stem cell (NSC) growth and differentia-
tion, on both 2D films and 3D matrices [61]. Among three PHA nanofiber matrices, PHBHHx showed the strongest potential to promote NSC differentiation into neurons, which 
is beneficial for CNS repair. Compared with 2D films, 3D 
nanofiber matrices appeared to be more suitable for NSC 
attachment, synaptic outgrowth and synaptogenesis. 
Both uniform and non-uniform wall porosity were pre-
pared by the particle leaching method [6]. The conduits were 
used to bridge the 10-mm defects in the sciatic nerve of 
Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats. Mechanical tests showed that the 
PHBHHx nerve conduits had suitable mechanical properties, 
including maximal loads of 3.1 N and 1.3 N for the conduits 
with non-uniform wall porosity and with uniform wall poros-
ity, respectively, and maximal stresses of 2.3 MPa and 0.94 
MPa for the conduits with non-uniform wall porosity and 
with uniform wall porosity, respectively. After 1 month of implantation, rapid functional recovery of the disrupted nerves was indicated. After 3 months of implantation in the rats, the conduits with uniform wall porosity and those with non-uniform wall porosity lost 24% and 20% of their origi-
nal average molecular weights, respectively. 
3.6. Other 
PHBHHx was studied for application as a tarsal substi-
tute [62]. PHBHHx scaffolds were implanted into tarsal de-
fects of Sprague-Dawley rats. PHBHHx scaffolds provided 
satisfactory repair, even though the implanted PHBHHx 
scaffolds showed inflammation at 2 weeks. Fibrous encapsu-
lation and scaffold degradation were observed on the 
PHBHHx implants. Combined with its strong, elastic me-
chanical properties, the tissue-compatible and biodegradable 
PHBHHx was proven to be a suitable candidate for tarsal 
repair. 
Murine islet beta cells incubated on PHBHHx have been 
reported to enhance insulin production [63]. More impor-
tantly, insulin gene expression as well as extracellular secre-
tion was un-regulated after growth on PHBHHx for 72h. The 
effects of oligo(3-hydroxyalkanoates), which are the degra-
dation products of PHBHHx, were not harmful to the beta 
cells. Therefore, PHBHHx warrants further study for appli-
cation as a pancreatic tissue engineering material [15]. Re-
search into the tissue engineering applications of PHBHHx 
has been summarized in Table 1. 
4. PROSPECTS 
PHBHHx is a new member of the PHA family, and even 
though it has made great progress in the biomedical field, there are still many problems that have not yet been fully 
resolved, such as: how to improve PHBHHx degradation rates, mechanical characteristics according to different tissue regeneration needs, how to carry biological activity signal molecules, and how to control the geometry suitable for the 
content of different organs. PHBHHx promises to extend the 
range of biomaterial suitability for tissue engineering.
