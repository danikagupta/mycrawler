Abstract  
Today there is the problem of fine water purification during its consumption and disposal in industr y from 
impurities of water -soluble organic compounds that enter it with pharmaceutical, cosmetic preparations, food 
waste, waste from the textile and chemic al industries. Diatomite is a good raw material for the production of these 
adsorbents. It is found that diatomite is the mesoporous sorbent. The permeability of diatomite can be increased by 
granulating of the rock. It is found that heat treatment is nece ssary to obtain more durable granules from diatomite: 
when the increasing in the temperature of heat treatment of granules the compressive strength of gra nules increases 
too. At the same time, when the temperature of the heat treatment is increasing, the e quilibrium adsorption of 
methylene blue on diatomite granules is decreasing. The optimum temperature for the heat treatment o f granules is 
550 °C. It is found that the heat treatment and granulation of diatomite do not have a significant i mpact on the 
adsorptive -structural properties of the rock: up to 70 % of the pore volume of granules is the volume of mesopo res. 
The powdered adsorbent from diatomite which can be obtained by the developed laboratory method can b e used in 
industrial water purification sche mes where static adsorption is used for fine water purification. Using the 
developed laboratory method for producing granular adsorbent from diatomite, it is possible to produ ce an 
adsorbent for water purification under dynamic adsorption conditions, where  a high value of the sorbent 
permeability is important.
