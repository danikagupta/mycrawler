Dyeing efﬂuents have become a vital source of water pollution. Due to the xenobiotic properties and tox-
icity to all life forms including humans, removal of undesirable color and associated toxicity is crucial. Inthis study, ﬁve dye decolorizing bacteria were isolated from dyeing efﬂuent using selective enrichment
culture in Bushnell-Haas (BH) medium amended with co-substrate (i.e. glucose, yeast extract) and 100
mg L
/C01of each commercially available reactive dyes viz.Novacron Orange FN-R, Novacron Brilliant
Blue FN-R, Novacron Super Black G, Bezema Yellow S8-G and Bezema Red S2-B. The isolated bacteriawere identiﬁed and assigned as Neisseria sp.,Vibrio sp.,Bacillus sp.,Bacillus sp. and Aeromonas sp. based
on their phenotypic (cultural, morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristic) observation.
The dye decolorization efﬁciency was estimated spectrophotometrically up to 6 days of static incubationat 37 /C176C and observed that all of the isolates were unable to induce decolorization in absence of co-
substrate. In case of monoculture, decolorization percentage varies from no visible decolorization
(Bezema Red S2-B by Ek-5) to highest 90% decolorization (Novacron Brilliant Blue FN-R by Ek-13)whereas the decolorization percentage of bacterial consortium varies from 65% (Bezema Yellow S8-G)
to 90% (Novacron Brilliant Blue FN-R and Novacron Super Black G). The study outlines the co-
substrates mediated decolorization process where bacterial consortium proved as efﬁcient dye decol-orizer than that of the monocultures. This ﬁnding confers possibility of using novel microbial consortiumfor biological treatment of disreputable dyeing efﬂuents.

1. Introduction
Reactive dyes are extensively used in textile industry because of
their large size which results in high afﬁnity to bind with cellulosic
ﬁber. With the increased demand for textile products, the world-
wide annual growth rates of reactive dyes are also increasing and
accounts for four times as much as for conventional dyes [1].
Simultaneously, the textile industry and its waste waters have
increased proportionally making it one of the main sources of sev-
ere pollution problems now-a-days. High amount of water used
during dyeing and washing textiles, ultimately ﬁnds their way to
the surface water system carrying a considerable amount oforganic dyes. For example, a dark-color reactive dyeing process
for one kilogram of cotton material consumes 70 L of fresh and soft
water [2]. Also, from the dyes wasted (10–25% of the total dyes
produced) during the textile processes, 2–20% are directly released
to the surface water system [3]. These high colors renders the
water unﬁt for use at the downstream of the disposal point and
may hinder light penetration thereby affecting aquatic life and
continuously threatening the biodiversity [4–6] . However, beyond
color, the presence of these dyes in aqueous ecosystems presents
serious environmental and health concerns as a result of the toxi-
city of the free dyes themselves and their transformation into toxic,
mutagenic and carcinogenic amines, primarily as result of anaero-
bic microbial reductive cleavage of the azo bond [7–9] or even
caused by products obtained after oxidation via cytochrome P450
[10–12] . The existing physical, chemical and photochemical
approaches for the treatment of such dyeing efﬂuents have disad-
vantages of being highly expensive, associated operational and
technical difﬁculties, and production of large amounts of sludge
as well as toxic substances [13,14] . In order to overcome these

Dyeing Efﬂuent. Journal of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (2018), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jgeb.2018.02.005drawbacks, over the past few decades, biological approaches such
as biodegradation and biosorption by both live and dead microbial
biomass in aerobic, anaerobic or combined treatment processes
with a number of bacteria, fungi, yeasts and algae [15], have been
investigated. Efforts to isolate bacterial cultures capable of degrad-
ing azo dyes started in the 1970s with reports of Bacillus subtilis
[16] and since then numerous bacteria and fungi capable of dye
decolorization, either in pure cultures or in consortia, have been
reported [17–21] . Several studies on the decolorization and degra-
dation of reactive azo dyes have been indicated the involvement of
various extracellular reductive enzymes such as azoreductase and
oxidative enzymes such as laccase, tyrosinase, lignin and man-
ganese peroxidases [22]. Advantages of biological processes over
conventional processes include conversion of organic compounds
to non-toxic products (water and carbon dioxide), low cost, sus-tainability and easy to use [23]. Although still, the detail metabolic
demands of different microbes are complex, impeding their utiliza-
tion for the remediation of huge amount of colored wastewater. As
restrictive environmental legislation, the ecological problem and
the high cost of conventional technologies have resulted in the
search of environmental friendly and economically viable wastew-
ater treatment plants, it is thus important to explore the possibil-
ities of isolating efﬁcient dye decolorizing microbial communities
as well as their consortia for their use under favorable environ-
mental conditions in biological treatment of noxious dying
efﬂuent.
Keeping in view of the above background, the present study was
focused on the screening and characterization of potent indigenous
bacterial isolates from textile dying efﬂuents and utilization of
these isolates as monoculture and consortium for decolorization
of some commercially available textile reactive dyes as well as
dye mixture.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Dyestuff, media and chemicals
Dyes used throughout the present study were commercially
available reactive dyes viz.Novacron Orange FN-R, Novacron Bril-
liant Blue FN-R, Novacron Super Black G, Bezema Yellow S8-G
and Bezema Red S2-B which were collected from KDS Textile Mills
Ltd., Chittagong, Bangladesh. These dyes are of the same chemical
class and function having different reactive systems in order to
form reactive bonds with the substrates. Stock solution of the
experimental dyes were prepared by dissolving 1 g of each dye into
100 mL of sterile distilled water, ﬁltered and stored in brown bottle
at room temperature. From the stock, working solution was pre-
pared to give a ﬁnal concentration of 100 mg L
/C01. A mixture of all
dyes was prepared by adding each of the dye solution in 1:1 pro-
portion by maintaining a ﬁnal concentration of 100 mg L/C01for each
dye and used for enrichment, isolation and screening of the potent
dye decolorizing bacteria. All media ingredients and reagents were
of analytical grade with desired purity and purchased from Hi-
Media Laboratories, India; Merck, Germany and Sigma-Aldrich
Ltd., USA.
2.2. Enrichment, isolation and screening of dye decolorizing bacteria
Samples viz.inlet and outlet efﬂuent of the efﬂuent treatment
plant, dye contaminated soil and nearby canal efﬂuent collected
from the vicinity of the KDS. Textile Mills Ltd., Chittagong, Bangla-
desh were used to isolate dye decolorizing bacteria. The physico-
chemical and microbiological analysis of the collected samples
were reported previously [24]. The isolation was carried out in
Bushnell-Haas (BH) medium [25]. The medium composition wasKH2PO4– 0.1%, K 2HPO 4– 0.1%, MgSO 4.7H 2O – 0.02%, CaCl 2.2H 2O
– 0.002%, NH 4Cl – 0.1%, NH 4NO 3– 0.1%, NaCl – 0.01%, and FeCl 3-
/C16H2O – 0.005%. The medium was supplemented with 0.4% glucose
and yeast extract respectively as a co-substrate and the pH was
adjusted to 7.0. For enrichment of dye decolorizing bacteria, 10
mL of the efﬂuent and 10 g soil from each sample was inoculated
in 250 mL conical ﬂask containing 90 mL sterilized BH medium
supplemented with ﬁlter sterilized 100 mgL/C01dye mixture. After
3 days of incubation (37 /C176C, 150 rpm) 10 mL enriched broth was
transferred to fresh dye supplemented BH medium and incubated
at the same condition for another 3 days. Such serial transfers were
performed for 3cycles for the enrichment of putative dye decol-
orizing bacteria. Serial dilutions of the enriched broth were made
up to 10/C06dilutions and aliquots from each dilution were placed
on BH agar medium supplemented with 100 mg L/C01of dye mixture
and incubated at 37 /C176C for 48 h. After incubation, morphologically
distinct and prominent colonies were picked up and puriﬁed
through repeated streaking on the same medium. The puriﬁed bac-
terial isolates were maintained in nutrient agar slants for routine
works and preserved for long term in 30% glycerol broth at /C080/C176C.
2.3. Identiﬁcation of the selected isolates
Bacterial isolates able to grow profusely at 100 mgL/C01of dye
mixture were validated as promising dye decolorizer and subse-
quently, characterized based on their cultural (e.g., colony color,
form, margin, surface and elevation); morphological (e.g., cell
shape and arrangement, sporulation); physiological (e.g., growth
response at different temperature, pH and salt concentration)
and biochemical (e.g., motility test, catalase, oxidase, urease, MR-
VP, Indole test, citrate utilization, nitrate reduction, H 2S produc-
tion, enzymatic hydrolysis and different sugar fermentation test)
characteristics as described in the Cowan and Steel’s Manual for
the identiﬁcation of Medical Bacteria [26]. The isolates were then
provisionally identiﬁed up to genus level by comparing the test
results with the standard descriptions given in Bergey’s Manual
of Determinative Bacteriology [27].
2.4. Dye decolorization assay2.4.1. Determination of absorption maxima ( k
max) and plotting of
standard curve
Absorption maxima (kmax)of each dye as well as dye mixture
were determined in decolorizing medium through scanning the
absorption of light within the visible range (400–700 nm) at an
intervals of 10 nm using double beam UV–Vis Spectrophotometer
(Optima sp 3000 nano, Japan). The wavelength reﬂecting the high-
est optical density was regarded as their corresponding maximumwavelength ( k
max) and after determining the kmaxi.e., Novacron
Orange FN-R at 490 nm, Novacron Brilliant Blue FN-R at 610 nm,
Novacron Black G at 600 nm, Bezama Yellow S8-G at 410 nm,
Bezema Red S2-B at 530 nm and Dye mixture at 510 nm ,standard
curve for each dye as well as dye mixture was obtained. Brieﬂy,
standard solutions of the known concentrations (0.0, 0.1, 1, 10,
100 mgL/C01) were prepared in dye decolorizing medium and cen-
trifuged (10,000 g, 15 min at 4 /C176C). The absorbance of the super-
natant was recorded against a blank to avoid media interference
and was plotted against dye concentration in Microsoft/C210Ofﬁce
Excel 2007. Using ‘‘scatter” function, trend line was added and then
the R2value was calculated. For the experimental values obtained
through the same procedure, the same equation was used to calcu-
late the percentage (%) of dye decolorization.
2.4.2. Inoculums preparation and development of bacterial consortium
Much importance was given on inoculums preparation as vari-
ation in the physiology and growth condition of microorganisms2 M.E. Karim et al. / Journal of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology xxx (2018) xxx–xxx

lated in Luria Bertani (LB) broth (Tryptone 5 g, Yeast extract 10 g,
NaCl 10 g and Distilled water 1 L) and incubated for 24 h at 37 /C176C
under agitation (160 rpm). The broth culture was harvested by
centrifugation (10,000 g, 15 min at 4 /C176C), washed with 0.85% NaCl
solution and resuspended in the same. Optical density was
adjusted to 0.5 MacFarland standards (1.5 /C2108cells/mL) to get
uniform cell density. Finally, Bacterial consortium was developed
by mixing all isolates in 1:1 ratio by maintaining uniform cell den-
sity (1.5 /C2108cells/mL) for each isolates.
2.4.3. Analysis of decolorization efﬁciency
For dye decolorization experiment, Erlenmeyer ﬂasks (250 mL)
containing 50 mL of sterilized BH medium (pH 7.0) amended with
each experimental dye as well as dye mixture to a ﬁnal concentra-
tion of 100 mg L/C01were inoculated with 10% (v/v) inoculums of
each isolate as well as the developed consortium and incubated
for 6 days (at 37 /C176C with 160 rpm). BH broth without co-
substrate i.e., Glucose and yeast extract was also inoculated to
assess the utilization of dyes as a sole source of energy. Control
was maintained without inoculation. After 2, 4 and 6 days of incu-
bation the culture broth was centrifuged (10,000 g, 15 min at 4 /C176C)
and absorbance of the supernatant was recorded at the corre-
sponding kmaxof each dye solution as mentioned earlier by a dou-
ble beam UV–Visible spectrophotometer (Kuobta 6930, Japan). The
decolorization activity in terms of (%) decolorization was calcu-
lated from standard curve of the dyes according to the formula
given by Chen et al. [28]:

2.5. Statistical analysis
All experiments were conducted in triplicate and mean ± stan-
dard deviation values were expressed. Data was analyzed by using
GraphPad Prism Software 6 (GPPS 6).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Isolation, screening and identiﬁcation of dye decolorizing bacterial
isolates
In order to isolate dye decolorizing bacteria, the enriched cul-
ture broth were inoculated in BH agar medium amended with
the dye mixture. A total of 30 morphologically distinct bacterialcolonies were isolated and screened out by repeated streaking on
dye supplemented BH agar medium. Based on vigorous growth
on the medium four bacterial isolates designated as EK5, EK6,
EK7, EK9 and EK13 were selected for further studies. During
screening process no zone of clearance around bacterial colonies
was observed as reported previously [29,30] . Hence, growth on
dye supplemented BH agar medium as white colonies considered
as a positive result for screening potent dye decolorizers. According
to Chen et al. [28] cell mat coloring occurs as a result of biosorption
of dye, whereas retaining the original mat color indicates biodegra-
dation. Thus retaining the original colony color presumptively sug-
gests that dye decolorization was an enzymatic process rather than
adsorption of dyes.
The selected bacterial isolates were characterized on the basis
of their cultural, morphological physiological and biochemical
characteristics as presented in Table 1 . All these characteristics
were then compared with the standard description of Bergey’s
Manual of Determinative Bacteriology [27] and the isolates wereprovisionally identiﬁed up to the genus as Neisseria sp. (EK5), Vibrio
sp. (EK6) , Bacillus sp. (EK7), Bacillus sp. (EK9) and Aeromonas sp.
(EK13).
3.2. Dye decolorization by bacterial monoculture and consortium
In the present study selected bacterial isolates and developed
consortium were tested for their ability to decolorize ﬁve com-
monly used textile reactive dyes (Novacron Orange FN-R, Novacron
Brilliant Blue FN-R, Novacron Super Black G, Bezema Yellow S8-G
and Bezema Red S2-B) as well as dye mixture at a ﬁnal concentra-
tion of 100 mg L
/C01. It has been reported that a typical textile efﬂu-
ent contains a dye mass concentration of 10–50 mg L/C01[31].
Therefore, a ﬁnal dye concentration of 100 mg L/C01was chosen for
decolorization assay throughout the study.
After 2, 4 and 6 days of incubation period, satisfactory result of
dye decolorization by selected bacterial monoculture and consor-
tium was recorded. However, despite repeated attempts, no decol-
orization was observed in BH medium without co-substrate, i.e.
glucose and yeast extract indicating the obligate requirement of
labile carbon and nitrogen sources for induction of dye decoloriza-
tion as also described in many studies [32–35] . Previous studies
reported that only few researches were successful in isolating bac-
terial culture capable of utilizing dyes as sole source of energy [36].
This may be due to co-metabolic nature of microorganisms in nat-
ural environments. In co-metabolic process, speciﬁc co-substrates
are added which can induce the biodegradation process and subse-
quently, reduce the overall process time [37]. It was reported that
medium compositions are critical to the efﬁciency of microbial
decolorization and the reduction of azo dyes depends on the pres-
ence and availability of a co-substrate because it acts as an electron
donor for the azo dye reduction [17,38] . Many different co-
substrates were found to suite as electron donor, like glucose and
yeast extract, and addition of co-substrates induces dye degrading
enzymes [39,40] .
Decolorization of Bezema Red S2-B by selected bacterial isolates
and consortium were recorded and highest decolorization (75%)
was observed with the bacterial consortium after 6 days of incuba-
tion period ( Fig. 1 ). The decolorization efﬁciency of isolate Ek6
(42%), EK7 (41%) and EK13 (41%) were almost similar within the
same incubation period. Unfortunately isolate EK5 was unable to
decolorize the dye even after desired incubation periods (6 days).
Decolorization of Bezema Yellow S8-G by selected bacterial iso-
lates and consortium were shown in the Fig. 2 . In this experiment
bacterial consortium represented as the signiﬁcant decolorizer
(65%) of the experimental dye followed by isolate EK7 (55%), EK6
(50%), EK9 (47%), EK13 (38%) and EK5 (30%) after 6 days ofincubation.
In the present study the highest decolorization (90%) was for
Novacron Super Black-G dye by the bacterial consortium as shown
in the Fig. 3 . Others isolates followed almost similar decolorization
pattern such as isolate Ek5 and EK6 (65%) followed by isolate EK9
(40%) and EK7 (35%) at the end of incubation period. Only 23%
decolorization was observed for the isolate EK13.
Decolorization of Novacron Brilliant Blue FN-R by bacterial iso-
lates and consortium were also represented in the Fig. 4 . In this
case, isolate EK13 (90%), EK7 (83%) and also consortium (80%) were
represented as the top decolorizer of the experimental dye fol-
lowed by isolate EK6 (67%), EK5 (43%) and EK9 (40%) after 6 days
of incubation. Among the tested dyes this is the only dye where
most of the isolates as well as consortium were found to decolorize
more efﬁciently.
Bacterial consortium decolorized about 70% of the Novacron
Orange FN-R dye followed by isolate Ek6 (40%), EK9 (39%), EK13
(27%), EK7 (25%) and EK5 (19%) ( Fig. 5 ).M.E. Karim et al. / Journal of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology xxx (2018) xxx–xxx 3

Dyeing Efﬂuent. Journal of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (2018), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jgeb.2018.02.005Finally an attempt was also made to investigate the decoloriza-
tion of all experimental dye mixtures by the selected bacterial iso-
lates as well as developed consortium ( Fig. 6 ). This case also shown
that bacterial consortium proved to be potent dye decolorizer andthe highest decolorization (75%) achieved within 6 days of incuba-
tion. The decolorization efﬁciency of isolate EK6 (65%) and EK7
(67%) were almost similar, whereas isolate EK5, EK9 and EK13
decolorized 40%, 46% and 36% respectively within the speculated
incubation period.
From the above interpretation, it was found that all the selected
bacterial isolates have tolerance to all experimental dyes, but
decolorization rates were different for each dye. In the present
study, the dye Bezema Red S2-B and Novacron Orange FN-R was
found to be difﬁcult to decolorize by the monoculture and Bezema
Yellow S8-G by the consortium. The difference in decolorization
pattern is due to the dissimilarity in speciﬁcities, structure and
complexity, particularly on the nature and position of substituent
in the aromatic rings and the interaction with azo bond with differ-
ent dyes as reported by many authors [41,42] .
The developed bacterial consortium was more efﬁcient in
decolorizing pure dye solutions as well as mixture of all dyes,
which indicates that microbial consortium is more powerful agent
to treat dying wastewater than single bacterial inoculums. All the
isolates used for development of consortium had showed compat-
ibility with each other as no reduction in decolorization percentage
was observed during the decolorization cycle. Waghmode et al.
[43] reported the decolorization and biodegradation of 150–200
mg L/C01Rubin GFL dye by microbial consortium GG-BL. The impor-
tance and the efﬁciency of bacterial consortium to decolorize reac-
tive azo dyes than monoculturewere reported previously by many
authors [44–49] .
In this study, most of the bacterial genera were reported previ-
ously for dye decolorization studies, except Neisseria sp. which is
still not documented as a dye decolorizing bacteria in the litera-
ture. The presence of the genus Bacillus sp. in textile efﬂuent is a
regular ﬁnding and many authors reported the role of these bacte-
rial genera for various dye degradation studies [50]. The capability
ofVibrio sp.such as Vibrio logei for degradation of textile dyes has
been exploited [51]. Sharma et al. [52] collected various soil and

Although, bacterial isolates such as Nesseria sp. ,Vibrio sp. and Aero-

logical treatment of noxious wastewater may pose a great public
health problem, if these isolates are not managed properly. The uti-

bial genome or cloning of desired gene from pathogenic strain to
non-pathogenic strain might be helpful in this regard, considering
their broad spectrum application for sustainable environmental
remediation.
4. Conclusion
Textile dyeing efﬂuent is a great threat to sustainable environ-
mental development and remediation of this efﬂuent represents
an arduous task. Considering this fact, in the present study, isola-
tion, identiﬁcation and decolorization of some commercially avail-
able textile reactive dyes by indigenous bacterial isolates viz.
Neisseria sp., Vibrio sp., Bacillus sp. ,Bacillus sp. ,Aeromonas sp. and
their consortium were investigated. The study clearly demon-
strates that bacterial isolates didn’t utilize the dyes as their sole
source of energy; instead, required appropriate co-substrates, i.e.,
glucose and yeast extract, for induction of dye decolorization and
associated metabolism. The developed bacterial consortium was
much more efﬁcient in decolorizing single dyes as well as mixture
of dyes than monocultures indicating the potential of mixed micro-
bial consortium as potent bioremediation agent for cost effective
removal of diverse dyes from dying efﬂuent. Further studies on
molecular characterization of the isolated bacteria, optimization
of their cultural conditions and detoxiﬁcation mechanism are
required to validate the isolates as promising bioremediation
agents.
