lucioperca ) were assessed. Pikeperch with an initial mean (SD) weight of 17.7 (4.2) g were exposed to 0.9
(control), 3.6, 5.2, 7.1, 11.2 and 18.9 μMN H 3in the water for 42 days. Plasma NH 4+concentrations stayed at
control levels (~650 μM) up to 11.2 μMN H 3in the water. At the highest water NH 3concentration tested, plasma
NH4+had more than doubled to 1400 μM. Based on the speci ﬁc growth rate, the EC 10value for NH 3was 5.7 μM.
When pikeperch (initial mean (SD) weight of 27.0 (4.9) g) were exposed to 0.1 (control), 1.5, 2.3, 3.7, 6.1, 10.2,
15.8 and 25.6 mM NO 3−for 42 days, mean (SD) plasma NO 3−concentrations increased linearly from 88 (47) to
5993 (899) μM at the highest ambient NO 3−level. Feed intake, speci ﬁc growth rate and feed conversion ratio
were not affected. Neither NH 3nor NO 3−exposure signi ﬁcantly affected haematocrit, plasma concentrations of
cortisol, glucose, lactate, osmolality, gill morphology or branchial Na+/K+-ATPase activity in pikeperch. For juve-
nile pikeperch we advise not to exceed a water NH 3concentration of 3.4 μM (0.05 mg NH 3–N/L), the lower limit
of the 95% con ﬁdence interval of the EC 10value for SGR, to ensure proper physiology and growth. For NO 3−we
advise not to exceed 25 mM (350 mg NO 3−–N/L). This criterion is based on the highest NO 3−concentration
tested (25.6 mM). As no negative effects were detected at the highest concentration tested, the actual NO 3−
threshold probably exceeds 25.6 mM.

1. Introduction
Aquaculture of pikeperch ( Sander lucioperca )i si m p o r t a n tf o rt h ed i -
versiﬁcation of freshwater aquaculture production in Northern and
Central Europe, and an attractive alternative for common carp ( Cyprinus
carpio ) and rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ). Among aquacultur-
ists interest increases to intensify aquaculture of pikeperch ( Müller-
Belecke and Zienert, 2008 ). In intensive recirculating aquaculture
systems (RAS) ﬁsh run the risk of signi ﬁcant exposure to nitrogenous
wastes including ammonia (NH 3), nitrite (NO 2−) and nitrate (NO 3−).
Nitrogenous waste is produced by ﬁsh through protein catabolism
(Wood, 1993 ). The majority of teleostean ﬁshes, including pikeperch,
are ammonotelic and excrete most of their nitrogenous waste as
ammonia across the gills to the water ( Wilkie, 2002 ). High water am-
monia leads to rapid accumulation of ammonia in plasma and tissues(Wright et al., 2007 ), where, at physiological pH, it is mainly present
as NH 4+(Wilkie, 2002 ). High internal ammonia is neurotoxic (Cooper
and Plum, 1987 in Wilkie, 2002 ). High water ammonia is an important
limiting factor for intensive aquaculture ( Boeuf et al., 1999 )a n ds h o u l d
therefore be kept below a de ﬁned species-speci ﬁc threshold.
In RAS, ammonia in the culture water is controlled by conversion of
ammonia to NO 3−in aerobic bio ﬁlters. NO 3−subsequently accumulates
in the culture water ( Bovendeur et al., 1987; Eding et al., 2006 )a n d
ﬁsh farmed in RAS may be chronically exposed to NO 3−levels up to
70 mM (1000 mg N/L; Van Rijn, 2010 ). High water NO 3−results in the
appearance of NO 3−in the plasma compartment ( Schram et al., in
press; Stormer et al., 1996 ). Uptake of NO 3−via the gills is low compared
to that of ammonia and nitrite due to an apparently low branchial per-
meability for NO 3−(Stormer et al., 1996 ). NO 3−is less toxic than nitrite
and ammonia ( Scott and Crunkilton, 2000 ). Chronic exposure to high
NO3−however, can lead to reduced feed intake, and growth ( Schram
et al., in press ). In addition, nitrate was identi ﬁed as being potentially
associated with health problems observed in rainbow trout reared in
RAS with near zero water exchange ( Davidson et al., 2011 ).
We hypothesized that chronic exposure of juvenile pikeperch to NH 3
or NO 3−above certain threshold concentrations result in physiologicalAquaculture 420 –421 (2014) 95 –104

journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/aqua-onlinedisturbance and reduced growth. Neither NH 3nor NO 3−threshold con-
centrations have been established for juvenile pikeperch. As a result it
is unclear whether intensive farming of pikeperch at high water NH 3
or NO 3−results in physiological disturbance and reduced growth. To
test this hypothesis and to establish threshold concentrations, we ex-
posed juvenile pikeperch to increased water NH 3and NO 3−levels for
42 days.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Experimental ﬁsh
Juvenile pikeperch ( S. lucioperca ) were obtained from Excellence
Fish BV, Horst, The Netherlands. Husbandry and experimentation
were in accordance with the Dutch law on animal welfare, and
approved by the ethical committee for animal experimentation of
Wageningen UR Livestock Research (number 2012053.b for the NH 3
experiment, number 2012021.b for the NO 3−experiment).
2.2. Experimental exposure system
During acclimatization and the experimental period of both experi-
ments, all aquaria were supplied with local tap water at a ﬂow rate of
500 L/d. Experimental NH 3concentrations were realised by addition
of NH 4Cl stock solutions ( Table 1 ). Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3)w a s
added to the NH 4Cl stock solutions to adjust the pH (overall pH range:
7.00–8.18; Table 1 ). In addition, sodium chloride (NaCl) was added to
the NH 4Cl stock solutions to compensate for the differences in chloride
concentrations in the aquaria arising from NH 4Cl addition. Total predict-
ed sodium concentrations in the aquaria from NaHCO 3and NaCl com-
bined were equal among treatments ( Table 1 ). Fresh stock solutions
were prepared daily during the ﬁrst six days of the experimental period.
During the remainder of the experimental periods fresh stock solutions
were prepared twice per week. To prevent evaporation of NH 3,s t o c ks o -
lutions were stored in closed vessels and inside the vessel the surface ofthe stock solution was covered by a ﬂoating plastic sheet. NH
3concen-
trations were gradually increased to the designated concentrations dur-ing the ﬁrst six days of the experimental period.
Experimental NO
3−concentrations were realised by addition of
NaNO 3stock solutions ( Table 2 ). Fresh stock solutions were prepared
daily during the ﬁrst ten days of the experimental periods. During the
remainder of the experimental periods fresh stock solutions were pre-
pared twice per week for both experiments. NO 3−concentrations were
gradually increased to the designated concentrations during the ﬁrst
ten days of the experimental period.
All stock solutions were prepared in tap water and pumped into the
aquaria by a peristaltic pump (Watson Marlow 505 S; Rotterdam, The
Netherlands) at a ﬂow rate of 5.00 L/d per aquarium.2.3. NH 3experiment
Juvenile pikeperch (n = 192) with a mean (SD) weight of 17.7
(4.2) g were randomly divided over 16 30-L rectangular aquaria and ac-
climatized to the experimental aquaria for seven days. The experiment
lasted for 42 days and consisted of eight, duplicated treatments which
were randomly assigned to the aquaria. Two extra aquaria were in-cluded to collect blood and plasma of untreated ﬁsh at the start of the
experiment (treatment 1, t = 0). Fish in treatments 3 to 8 were ex-posed to one of six different NH
3concentrations in the water: 0.9 (con-
trol), 3.6, 5.2, 7.1, 11.2 and 18.9 μM. We aimed for a test concentration
range around the NH 3threshold for chronic effects, without reaching
acutely toxic NH 3concentrations. To avoid acute toxicity, the highest
test concentration was set at approximately 50% of the 96 h LC 50of
36μM for the closely related walleye ( Stizostedion vitreum )(Arthur
et al., 1987 ). Fish in treatment 2 (pair-fed control) were kept at control
(0.5μM) NH 3levels and fed the same feed ration as the ﬁsh kept at the
highest (18.9 μM) NH 3level to discriminate between effects caused by
low feed intake and exposure to a high NH 3concentration in the water.
2.4. NO 3−experiment
Juvenile pikeperch (n = 240) with an individual mean (SD) weight
of 27.0 (4.9) g were randomly divided over 20 30-L rectangular aquaria
and acclimatized to the experimental aquaria for 14 days. The NO 3−ex-
periment lasted for 42 days and consisted of ten duplicated treatments,
which were assigned randomly to the aquaria. Two extra aquaria (treat-
ment 1, t = 0) were included to collect blood and plasma of untreated
ﬁsh at the start of the experiment. In treatments 3 to 10 ﬁsh were
exposed to one of eight different NO 3−concentrations in the water: 0.1
(control), 1.5, 2.3, 3.7, 6.1, 10.2, 15.8 and 25.6 mM. Fish in treatment 2
(pair fed control) were kept at control (0.1 mM) NO 3−levels and pair-
fed to the ﬁsh kept in 25.6 mM NO 3−.
2.5. Water quality
All aquaria were equipped with an air stone to guaranty good mixing
of the added stock solutions with the aquarium water. Flow rates were
monitored daily and adjusted when necessary to reach the desired NH 3
or NO 3−concentrations. Total ammonia (T Amm=N H 3+N H 4+)a n d
NO3−concentrations were monitored in the respective experiments
(Spectroquant cell tests for total ammonia and NO 3−–N, Merck, Darm-
stadt, Germany, Hach Lange DR2800 spectro-photometer, Germany).
In both experiments water samples were collected twice per week
from all aquaria at approximately 11 am, 1 h after the ﬁrst feeding ses-
sion of the day. NH 3concentrations were calculated from the tempera-
ture, pH and salinity dependent molar fraction of NH 3and the measured
TAmmconcentrations, using Table 9 in http:// ﬁsheries.org/hatchery .N H 3
concentrations were calculated to account for any variation in pH
among NH 3treatments. In both experiments water temperature, pH

Germany) and conductivity (WTW Cond 315i) were monitored daily
in all aquaria prior to the ﬁrst daily feeding session ( Tables 1 and 2 ).
Dissolved oxygen ranged 6.7 to 8.1 mg/L in the NH 3experiment and
from 6.7 to 7.0 mg/L in the NO 3−experiment. Water temperatures
were 23.8 °C in the NH 3experiment and 23.0 °C in the NO 3−experi-
ment. pH ranged from 7.00 to 8.18 in the NH 3experiment and from
7.10 to 7.98 in the NO 3−experiment.
2.6. Blood and plasma sampling
One day before exposure to NH 3or NO 3−started (day 0), ﬁsh in treat-
ment 1 (t = 0) were sampled. After 42 days of exposure, the ﬁsh from
the remaining treatments were sampled (12 ﬁsh per aquarium). Fish
were rapidly netted and anaesthetised in 0.1% (v/v) 2-phenoxyethanol
(Sigma, St. Louis, USA). Within 2 min, blood was taken by punctureof the caudal vessels with a syringe ﬁtted with a 25-gauge needle.
Na
2EDTA (NH 3experiment) or heparin (NO 3−experiment) was used
as anti-coagulant. A 10 μL aliquot blood was used to assess haematocrit,
the remainder was immediately centrifuged for 10 min (14,000 g,4° C )
and plasma was stored at −20 °C until further analyses.
2.7. Plasma NO 3−concentration —NO3−experiment
NOx(the sum of NO 2−and NO 3−) was measured with a commercial
nitrate/nitrite colorimetric assay kit (Cayman Chemical Company, Ann
Arbor, Michigan, USA). Prior to measurement, plasma samples were ﬁl-
tered using a Millipore Ultra-free MC ﬁlter device (0.1 μmp o r es i z e )t o
remove haemoglobin and reduce background absorbance and improve
colour formation with Griess reagents. Samples of 80 μL (in duplicate)
were diluted in the assay buffer and then incubated for 3 h at roomtemperature with 10 μL of Enzyme Co-factor mixture and 10 μLo f
NO
3−-reductase mixture. Fifty microliters of the ﬁrst Griess reagent
(R1) and of the second Griess reagent (R2) was added and absorbance
read at 530 nm in a Wallac 1420 VICTOR2counter (Turku, Finland).
Due to low plasma volumes and interference with heparin plasmaNO
2−could be determined in only a subset of samples. All NO 2−
-values
were below 35 μM, which we interpret to indicate that plasma NO x
consists primarily of NO 3−.
2.8. Plasma NH 4+—NH3experiment
Plasma NH 4+was determined using a commercial kit (Instruchemie,
Delfzijl, The Netherlands), with a protocol adapted for a 96-well micro-
plate application.2.9. Plasma concentrations of cortisol, glucose, lactate, plasma osmolality
and branchial Na+/K+-ATPase activity
Plasma cortisol was determined by radioimmunoassay as described
in detail by Metz et al. (2005) . Plasma osmolality was measured using a
cryoscopic osmometer (Osmomat 030, Gonotec, Germany). Plasma glu-
cose and lactate were measured with commercial enzymatic test kits
(Instruchemie, Delfzijl, The Netherlands), with protocols adapted to a
96-well microplate. For glucose, 10 μL sample or standard (5.55 mM
glucose) was mixed with 200 μL reagent and incubated for 10 min at
25 °C. Absorbance was read within 60 min at 495 nm. For lactate,
10μL sample or standard (4.44 mM lactate) or blank (8% perchloric
acid) was mixed with 290 μL of lactate reagent and incubated for
20 min at 37 °C. Absorbance was read at 355 nm. Branchial Na+/
K+-ATPase activity was measured as described by Metz et al. (2003) .

immunostained according to Dang et al. (2000) .A f t e rr e m o v a lo ft h e
parafﬁn, blocking of endogenous peroxidase with 2% (v/v) H 2O2and
blocking of non-speci ﬁc sites with 10% (v/v) normal goat serum, slides
were incubated overnight with a monoclonal antibody against chicken
Na+/K+-ATPase ( ﬁnal dilution of 1:500; IgG α5, Developmental Studies
Hybridoma Bank, Department of Biological Sciences, University of Iowa,USA). Goat anti-mouse (Nordic Immunology, Tilburg, The Netherlands)
was used as a second antibody (1:150). The slides were subsequently in-
cubated with mouse peroxidase anti -peroxidase (1:150) (M-PAP, Nordic
Immunology). In the peroxidase reaction 0.025% (w/v) 3,3 ′-diaminoben-
zidine (DAB) was used as chromogen in the presence of 0.0005% (v/v)
H
2O2. Finally, sections were dehydrated and mounted. As a control for
speciﬁcity the procedure was carried out as above, with the omission
of the ﬁrst antiserum.
2.11. Haematocrit levels
Immediately after blood puncture, subsamples were drawn into
heparinized glass capillaries and centrifuged (13,600 g; 3 min) to assess
haematocrit values. Results were rounded to the closest 0.5%.
2.12. Speci ﬁc growth rate, feed intake and feed conversion ratio
On day 0 and day 42, ﬁsh were individually weighed to the nearest

In both experiments ﬂoating feed (Skretting R-2 15F) was given
twice daily at 10 am and 2 pm until apparent satiation (no more feed
taken for at least 5 min following administration of the feed). Feedloads per aquarium were recorded daily. All uneaten pellets were
collected from each aquarium 1 h after each of the two daily feeding
sessions. Feed loss per aquarium was calculated as the total number of
uneaten feed pellets multiplied by 11.15 mg/pellet, the average weight
of a pellet, determined by weighing 100 feed pellets. Daily feed intake
per aquarium resulted from the difference between daily feed load
and daily feed loss. To account for mortalities, daily feed intake per
aquarium was divided by the number of ﬁsh in the aquarium, yielding
the daily feed intake per ﬁsh in each aquarium. Cumulative daily feed in-
take per ﬁsh was calculated from the daily feed intake per ﬁsh in each
aquarium. Total feed intake per ﬁsh (TFI) was determined as the cumu-
lative feed intake at the last day of the experiment. Total feed intake per
ﬁsh and biomass increase per ﬁsh were used to calculate feed conver-
sion ratio (FCR) as follows:
FCR¼TFI

where FCR = feed conversion ratio (g/g), TFI = total feed intake
(g/ﬁsh), W t= mean individual weight at day 42 (g) and W 0= mean
individual weight at day 0 (g).
2.13. Statistics2.13.1. Physiological parameters
Physiological parameters are expressed as mean (SD) of the individ-
ual measurements per treatment. For each treatment, 24 ﬁshes were
sampled; in some instances less samples were analysed due to mortal-
ities or because of insuf ﬁcient plasma volume. When necessary, data
were log-transformed to obtain residuals that were normally distribut-ed and to obtain homogeneity of variance of residuals across treatment
levels. Mean values for physiological parameters were tested for differ-
ences among the treatments using linear mixed models (REML) with
treatments as ﬁxed effects and aquarium as a random effect (F-tests
with Kenward –Rogers approximation to the residual degrees of free-
dom ( Kenward and Rogers, 1997 )). Statistical analyses were performed
in SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA). Only when sig-niﬁcant treatment effects were detected, a least signi ﬁcant difference
(LSD) post-hoc analysis was used to estimate the level of signi ﬁcance
between mean values. For both REML and LSD analysis the ﬁduciallimit was set at 5%. Linear regression analyses were performed with
response variables as ﬁxed effects and aquaria as random effects. In
addition, F-tests with Kenward –Rogers approximation to the residual
degrees of freedom were used ( Kenward and Rogers, 1997 ). Pair-fed
groups were not considered in regression analyses.
2.13.2. Feed intake and growth
Initial and ﬁnal individual weight, speci ﬁc growth rate (SGR) and
feed conversion ratio (FCR) are presented as means per treatment
(N = 2). Mean values per treatment were tested for signi ﬁcant differ-
ences among the treatments by one-way ANOVA. Only in case signi ﬁ-
cant treatment effects were detected, a least signi ﬁcant difference
(LSD) post-hoc analysis was used to estimate the level of signi ﬁcance
between mean values.
Mean (N = 2) cumulative daily feed intake per treatment was
tested for signi ﬁcant differences among the treatments by repeated
measures ANOVA. Only in case signi ﬁcant treatment effects were de-
tected, a post-hoc analysis (LSD for one-way ANOVA, Tukey for repeated
measures ANOVA) was used to estimate the level of signi ﬁcance be-
tween mean values. All analyses were performed in SAS 9.2. For all anal-yses the ﬁducial limit was set at 5%.
2.13.3. Concentration –effect curves
NH
3concentration –effect curves were ﬁtted for speci ﬁc growth rate
(SGR) and total feed intake per ﬁsh (TFI) using a log-logistic model
(Seefeldt et al., 1995 ). As a blank could not be included, the effects are
expressed as absolute values. Curve- ﬁtting was carried out with the
Marquadt and Levenberg algorithm ( Moré, 1978 )a sp r o v i d e di nt h e
PRISM 4.00 software package (GraphPad Software, Inc.). The 10% effectconcentrations (EC
10) and their 95% con ﬁdence limits were calculated
(Miller and Miller, 2000 ).
3. Results
3.1. Plasma NH 4+
Up to the second highest water NH 3concentration (11.2 μM) the
mean plasma NH 4+concentrations ranged between 614 and 762 μM
without signiﬁ cant differences among treatments. However, at 18.6 μM
water NH 3,t h ep l a s m aN H 4+concentration had signi ﬁcantly increased
to a nearly double level of 1399 μM compared to all other treatments
(Table 3 ).
3.2. Plasma NO 3−
Water NO 3−concentration had a strong effect on plasma NO 3−con-
centration. Plasma NO 3−concentrations differed among all treatments
(Table 4 ) and increased linearly with increasing water NO 3−concentration
([Plasma NO 3−]=0 . 2 3 ∗[Water NO 3−]−0.1(mM); P b0.0001). In pair-
fedﬁsh plasma NO 3−levels ( Table 4 ) were not affected.

In the NH 3experiment a total of 19 out of 168 ﬁsh had died across
NH3treatments, resulting in a survival rate ranging between 71 and
100% among treatments. Mortality was probably a consequence of low
feed intake as mortalities occurred mainly towards completion of the
NH3experiment and, without exception, dead ﬁsh appeared emaciated
(data not shown). Mortality could not be related to the NH 3treatments
(Table 7 ), leaving the underlying reason for emaciation unclear.
NH3exposure had a strong effect on total feed intake (TFI) and spe-
ciﬁc growth rate (SGR). For both TFI and SGR differences were detected
among NH 3treatments ( Table 7 ). At the highest NH 3concentration
(18.9 μM) the TFI had decreased by 69% and SGR by 75% compared to
control. The differences in TFI developed over time ( Fig. 2 ). Mean feed
conversion ratios (FCR) did not differ among NH 3treatments ( Table 7 ).
Noﬁsh died in the NO 3−experiment. Differences in ﬁnal weight, total
feed intake (TFI), speci ﬁc growth rate (SGR) and feed conversion ratio
(FCR) were not detected among NO 3−treatments ( Table 8 ).3.7. EC 10for total feed intake and SGR
The concentration –effect curves for TFI and SGR in relation to the
water NH 3concentration ( Fig. 3 A and B), yield an EC 10for NH 3of
7.1μM( 0 . 1m gN H 3–N/L), with a 95% con ﬁdence interval from 5.1 to
9.8μM when read against TFI. For SGR, a somewhat lower EC 10for
NH3of 5.7 μM( 0 . 0 8 m gN H 3–N/L), with a 95% con ﬁdence interval
from 3.4 to 9.7 μM was calculated.
4. Discussion
4.1. NH 3experiment
Juvenile pikeperch ( S. lucioperca ) successfully control plasma NH 4+
up to a water NH 3concentration of 11.2 μM. However, water NH 3levels
below 11.2 μM lead to reduced feed intake and growth and thus appear
superior parameters to assess NH 3-tolerance.

Fish produce ammonia as main end product of the catabolism of
ingested proteins ( Handy and Poxton, 1993 ). Ammonia then appears
in the plasma compartment, which shows postprandial peaks ( Wicks
and Randall, 2002a ). Ammonia toxicity is avoided in ﬁsh by up-
regulating muscle glutamine synthetase activity ( Wicks and Randall,
2002b ) and by excreting ammonia across the gills to the water
(Wilkie, 2002 ). High external (water) ammonia leads to an in ﬂux of am-
monia in plasma and tissues ( Wright et al., 2007 ). To avoid toxic plasma
ammonia levels during an in ﬂux of external ammonia, ﬁsh reduce their
own ammonia production by reduction of food intake ( Randall and Tsui,
2002 ). This ammonia defence mechanism explains the reduced feed in-
take we observed in ammonia exposed pikeperch. Differences in feed
intake showed up more or less instantaneously at the two highest
NH3levels (11.2 and 18.9 μM), resulting in signi ﬁcant differences in
total feed intake among treatments at the end of the experiment. Weconclude from this observation that the reduced growth in pikeperch
in response to NH
3is mainly an effect of reduced feed intake, which cor-
responds to previous observations on NH 3exposed turbot
(Scophthalmus maximus )(Person-Le Ruyet et al., 1997 ) and African cat-
ﬁsh (Clarias gariepinus )(Schram et al., 2010 ).
A higher ability of ﬁsh to cope with high external ammonia has been
related to lower plasma ammonia concentrations in these ﬁsh (Wicks
and Randall, 2002a ). The basal plasma NH 4+concentrations of around
650μM observed in pikeperch seem high compared to values reported
for other ﬁsh species (~160 μMN H 4+in African cat ﬁsh (Schram et al.,
2010 ); ~200 μMT amm in Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar )(Knoph andThorud, 1996 ); ~300 μMT amm in European seabass ( Dicentrarchus
labrax )(Lemarié et al., 2004 )), may re ﬂect an adaptation to piscivory,
and may be related to increased tolerance to NH 4+through protonation
of NH 3in the plasma compartment.
We advise to set the water NH 3threshold concentration for growth
at 3.4 μM, the lower limit of the 95% con ﬁdence interval of the EC 10we
calculated for growth. This indeed classi ﬁes juvenile pikeperch as signif-
icantly more sensitive to water ammonia levels than for instance African
catﬁsh (EC 10of 24 μM). Atlantic salmon appears more sensitive than
pikeperch, with growth being affected already above 1.4 μMN H 3
(Arillo et al., 1981 ); also, basal plasma total ammonium values in Atlan-
tic salmon are relatively low (~200 μMT amm,Knoph and Thorud, 1996 ).
From that perspective pikeperch seem relatively robust and tolerate
high water ammonia through the ability to maintain acceptable plasma
NH4+values over a rather wide range of water ammonia levels. The pre-
diction would be that this tolerance increases at lower water tempera-
tures assuming similar chemistry of NH 3in water and blood plasma
(Emerson et al., 1975 ). In Atlantic salmon ( Knoph and Thorud, 1996 )
and several other marine species such as European seabass, gilthead
seabream ( Sparus aurata ) and turbot ( Person-Le Ruyet et al., 1997 )
this ability seems absent as plasma ammonia has been observed to in-crease linearly with ammonia in the water. Unfortunately the possibili-
ties to explore the relation between basal plasma ammonia and
ammonia sensitivity are limited as data on plasma ammonia and de-
tailed threshold concentrations for chronic NH
3exposure of ﬁsh are
scarce.
The ability of pikeperch to buffer plasma NH 3to NH 4+at higher water
NH3is limited yet considerable as the plasma NH 4+concentration in
pikeperch exposed to 18.9 μMN H 3in the water doubled to almost
1.4 mM compared to control values. Apparently a threshold is
surpassed between 11.2 and 18.9 μMN H 3above which pikeperch can
no longer maintain low plasma NH 4+concentrations.
4.1.2. Plasma osmolality, plasma chloride, Na+/K+-ATPase activity and gill
morphology
Freshwater ﬁsh continuously lose ions via diffusion across the mu-
cous epithelium of gills and skin to the surrounding less saline water
(Evans et al., 2005). For homeostasis of bodily ﬂuids freshwater
ﬁsh tightly regulate plasma osmolality by active Na+and Cl−uptake
(McDonald and Wood, 1981 ). Hypochloremia was detected in pikeperch
exposed to 18.9 μMN H 3(concurrent with a signi ﬁcant increase in plas-
ma NH 4+) revealing a disturbance of chloride-homeostasis and interfer-
ence of plasma NH 4+with chloride handling. Branchial and intestinal
chloride uptake from water and food and renal reabsorption are key to
chloride homeostasis in freshwater ﬁsh (Fuentes et al., 1997 ). It would
seem then that the signiﬁ cant decrease in food intake seen at high
water NH 3also interferes with chloride regulation in this ﬁsh. Further,
signiﬁcant differences in osmolality were detected among NH 30510152025

treatment was also observed in pair-fed controls. Thus the decrease in
osmolality may indeed be an effect of reduced feed intake rather than
NH3exposure per se.
At high ambient ammonia several active NH 4+excretion pathways
could facilitate ammonia ef ﬂux (Wright and Wood, 2009 ). Na+/K+-
ATPase is a driving force in active NH 4+excretion when internal NH 4+
(replacing K+on the enzyme) is exchanged for waterborne Na+
(reviewed by Heisler, 1984; Evans, 1987; Evans et al., 2005 ). Increased
branchial Na+/K+-ATPase activity in response ammonia exposure has
been described for several ﬁsh species ( Alam and Frankel, 2006; Sinha
et al., 2012 ). However, in pikeperch branchial Na+/K+-ATPase activity
did not increase in response to increased ambient NH 3nor plasma
NH4+. An extensive (re-)analysis of NH 3chemistry at the (sub-)cellular
level and consideration of NH 3transporter (Rhesus) proteins ( Nakada
et al., 2007 ) seem indicated. At least four Rhesus protein species were
described in branchial epithelium of zebra ﬁsh (B r a u ne ta l . ,2 0 0 9 ), but
analysis of these is beyond the scope of this study.
There appears to be no consensus on the effect of ammonia on ﬁsh
gill morphology. In the past gill hyperplasia has been proposed as a
common indicator for ammonia toxicity in ﬁsh (Smith and Piper, 1975
in Mitchell and Cech, 1983; Redner and Stickney, 1979 in Mitchell and
Cech, 1983 ) based on various ammonia toxicity studies presenting evi-
dence of gill epithelial damage (citations in Mitchell and Cech, 1983 ).
However, no evidence of gill damage could be detected in ammonia ex-
posed rainbow trout ( O. mykiss)( Smart, 1976 ), Dover sole ( Solea solea )
and turbot ( S. maximus )(Alderson, 1979 ). The validity of attributing gill
hyperplasia to ammonia alone was questioned by Mitchell and Cech(1983) once they showed that gill hyperplasia was absent in ammonia
exposed channel cat ﬁsh (Ictalurus punctatus ), except when low levels
of chlorine compounds, residuals from municipal water treatment,were present next to ammonia. Indeed, for many ammonia toxicity
studies in the past the presence of chlorine compounds cannot be ex-
cluded. Gill damage observed in past ammonia toxicity studies should
however not be automatically attributed to chlorine rather ammoniaexposure as in African cat ﬁsh gill morphology gradually changed with
increasing NH
3exposure concentration in water that had not been chlo-
rinated ( Schram et al., 2010 ).
Morphological changes of the gills may be interpreted as adaptations
to increase the diffusion distance between the water and the blood ﬂow,
reducing the permeability of the gills and subsequently the in ﬂux of
NH3. No clear effects of ammonia exposure on gill morphology were ob-
served in pikeperch. The absence of such a morphological response inpikeperch gills surprised us as pikeperch were clearly affected by the
highest NH
3exposure concentration (18.9 μM). However, the absence
of morphological changes in the gills is not exceptional and has beenpreviously reported in other ammonia exposed ﬁsh species (see above).
4.1.3. Stress physiology
Plasma cortisol levels below 50 ng/mL or 138 nM are considered as
stress free levels (typical basal levels for common carp ( C. carpio )b e l o w
15 nM; Metz et al., 2005 ). Increases up to 166 nM are generally referred
to as a mild response, while rapid increases above 276 nM are generallyconsidered to re ﬂect a severe stress response ( Wendelaar Bonga, 1997 ).
The stress and energy metabolite parameters (plasma cortisol, glucose
and lactate) in pikeperch were not affected by NH
3exposure. Plasma
cortisol values found in this study (10 –18 nM) are very much lower
than values reported in other studies on pikeperch ( N700 nM,
Falahatkar et al., 2012 ;1 2 4 –180 nM, Sarameh et al., 2012 )a n dp r o b a b l y
the best representation of basal cortisol levels in pikeperch to date. Plas-
ma glucose and lactate levels observed in the NH 3experiment are
slightly higher than control values reported in other pikeperch studies(5 mM lactate, 4.5 –6 mM glucose, Falahatkar et al., 2012 ) but lie in
the range that can be considered normal. We conclude from theseobservations that ammonia even at its highest exposure concentration
apparently did not impose distress.
4.2. NO
3−experiment
NO3−exposed juvenile pikeperch accumulated nitrate in the plasma
compartment, but no effects on physiology and growth were detected
even at water nitrate as high as 26 mM, commensurate with the notion
that the end product of the nitrogen waste cycle is relatively harmless to
ﬁsh. The high NO 3−tolerance allows for low water exchange of RAS used
for juvenile pikeperch culture. However it should be noted that, next to
apparently relatively harmless NO 3−, other, potentially harmful com-
pounds may then accumulate in the rearing water.
4.2.1. Plasma NO 3−, feed intake and growth
Nitrate can become toxic to ﬁsh (Camargo et al., 2005 ). Chronic ex-
posure to high water nitrate leads to nitrate accumulation in the plasma
compartment and reduced feed intake and growth in African cat ﬁsh
(Schram et al., in press ). In pikeperch plasma NO 3−concentrations
increased linearly with increasing external NO 3−concentrations, seem-
ingly unaffected by the differences in sodium concentration and con-
ductivity among treatments. Plasma NO 3−increased in a very similar
manner to what we observed in NO 3−-exposed African cat ﬁsh (Schram
et al., in press ). Surprisingly, whereas African cat ﬁsh showed reduced
growth and feed intake upon nitrate exposure, pikeperch was refractory
to this treatment. Clearly species-speci ﬁc differences in NO 3−toxicity
exist and are not related to differences in the capability to maintain
low plasma NO 3−when external NO 3−is high. Instead the internal NO 3−0.00%0.50%1.00%1.50%2.00%2.50%3.00%

tration and conductivity arising from the sodium nitrate addition to
the aquaria apparently did not affect NO 3−accumulation in the plasma
given the linear increase in plasma NO 3−with increasing external NO 3−
concentrations.
The growth performance of the pikeperch in our NO 3−experiment
(overall mean (SD) speci ﬁc growth rate of 2.26 (0.15)%/d) corresponds
well to growth performances of similar sized pikeperch at the same
water temperature in commercial pikeperch farming (Vestergaard, per-
sonal communication).
Previously observed molar ratios (plasma:water) of approximately
0.2 in nitrate exposed rainbow trout ( Stormer et al., 1996 ) and African
catﬁsh (Schram et al., in press ) suggest that the integument forms a sig-
niﬁcant barrier to waterborne nitrate. The molar ratios we observed in
pikeperch range from 0.23 to 0.26 and are in good agreement withthese observations, suggesting similar nitrate handling in rainbow
trout, African catﬁ sh and pikeperch. Daily plasma sampling of catheter-
ized, nitrate exposed rainbow trout over a period (8 days) revealed thatan apparent chemical equilibrium was reached within a day ( Stormer
et al., 1996 ). We have no data that describe the time-kinetics of plasma
nitrate levels in pikeperch. However, considering Stormer et al.'s (1996)
observations on rainbow trout it seems unlikely that after 42 days of ni-trate exposure, nitrate further accumulates in the plasma to levels that
are eventually not tolerated by pikeperch. We therefore consider the
current experiment representative for chronic nitrate exposure. The
millimolar plasma NO
3−concentrations that are apparently tolerated
by pikeperch support the notion that NO 3−is not very toxic to ﬁsh and
may be considered an end product and stable non-toxic form of nitrog-
enous waste.
4.2.2. NO 3−effects on physiology and gill morphology
High levels of NO 3−in the water did not affect plasma osmolality and
plasma chloride. NO 3−exposure did not affect branchial Na+/K+-ATPase
activity. Apparently a signi ﬁcant hypernitratemia does not alter the ac-
tivity if this enzyme. This corresponds to our observation that the num-
ber of Na+/K+-ATPase rich chloride cells was not affected by NO 3−
exposure.
NO3−exposure did not cause morphological changes nor anomalies
of the branchial epithelium of pikeperch. The results taken jointly indi-
cate that high levels of NO 3−do not affect permeability of the gills, nei-
ther to water or ionic species central to osmotic homeostasis, nor to
NO3−itself ( Stormer et al., 1996 ) as we conclude from the linear mild in-
crease in molar ratios for NO 3−in water and plasma; clearly, NO 3−is not
very toxic for this species.
Considering the mildly elevated plasma cortisol values (just over
100 nM) observed in all NO 3−treatments, it seems likely that treatment
effects (if any) on plasma cortisol were overridden by cortisol release
due to sampling procedures. However, the normal values observed for
plasma glucose and plasma lactate in pikeperch suggest that NO 3−expo-
sure did not chronically stress the ﬁsh (Wendelaar Bonga, 1997 ).
4.3. Effect of ﬁsh size and life-stage on NH 3and NO 3−threshold
concentrations
Toxicity of nitrogenous compounds to ﬁsh has been shown to vary
with size and life-stage. NH 3sensitivity was shown to decrease with
age and size during the early ontogeny of chub ( Leuciscus cephalus )
(Gomulka et al., 2011 ). NH 3tolerance in rainbow trout has been report-
ed to increase as ﬁsh develop through the larval stages, to peak at juve-
nile and yearling stages and decrease thereafter ( Thurston and Russo,
1983 ).
NO3−sensitivity may decrease with increasing size of aquatic inverte-
brates and amphibians (Camargo et al., 2005 ). Speci ﬁcf o rﬁsh it has been
shown that the early life-stages of lake trout ( Salvelinus namaycush )a n d
lake white ﬁsh (Coregnus clupeoformisi ) are much more sensitive to NO 3−than the juveniles of these species ( McGurk et al., 2006 ). Information on
NO3−sensitivity in relation to body size beyond the juvenile stages of
ﬁsh is lacking. However, nitrite sensitivity has been reported to increase
with increasing size of Nile tilapia ( Oreochromis niloticus )(Atwood et al.,
2001) and fathead minnow ( Pimephales promelas )(Palachek and
Tomasso, 1984 ).
This information jointly taken, it is quite likely that NH 3and NO 3−
sensitivity of pikeperch varies with size and life-stage. Consequently
the here reported NH 3and NO 3−threshold concentrations should be
cautiously applied outside the size range (17 –25 g) we tested. Safe
levels for early life-stages are probably lower than the here reported
NH3and NO 3−threshold concentrations, as it is reasonable to consider
the early life-stages of pikeperch to be more sensitive than the juveniles
we tested. There appear to be no indications to consider larger
pikeperch to be more or even equally tolerant to NH 3and NO 3−as juve-
niles. The here reported thresholds could be cautiously applied to larger
pikeperch than tested, keeping in mind that safe levels are in fact possi-
bly lower. Note in this respect that reduced feed intake is a strong
indicator for too high ammonia and too high nitrate.
5. Conclusions
Juvenile pikeperch chronically exposed to NH 3as high as 11.2 μM
NH3did not show major physiological disturbances. However, feed in-
take and growth decreased already at very much lower NH 3concentra-
tions: the EC 10were found to be 5.7 μMf o rS G Ra n d7 . 1 μM for TFI. Feed
intake and growth are thus good and easily assessed indicators for neg-
ative effects of high NH 3on pikeperch. Considering the lower limit of the
95% con ﬁdence interval of the lowest EC 10value, the NH 3threshold
concentration for juvenile pikeperch should be set at 3.4 μM( 0 . 0 5m g
NH3–N/L).
Juvenile pikeperch chronically exposed to the highest NO 3−test con-
centration (25.6 mM) did not show major physiological disturbances
or reduced growth performance. The threshold concentration for chronic
NO3−exposure of juvenile pikeperch t hus seems to lie outside the NO 3−
range investigated in the current experiment. We propose to use the
highest test concentration that (still) showed no signi ﬁcant effect as a
safe threshold concentration for NO 3−:2 5 . 6m M( 3 5 8m gN O 3−–N/L).
