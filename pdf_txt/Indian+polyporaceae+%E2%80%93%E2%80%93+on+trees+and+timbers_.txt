In continuation of the exploration of the diversi ty of polyporoid fungi in north-west India, five
polypores identified as Antrodia leucaena ,A.pulvinascens ,Fomitiporia apiahyna ,Inocutis
ludoviciana andInonotus venezuelicus are presented as new to India. These species are reported
based on material collected from localities in the Sirmaur District (Himachal Pradesh) and PatialaDistrict (Punjab). Descriptions, photographs an d line drawings of the new records from India are

INTRODUCTION
Polypores are characteristic in havi ng a typical poroid hymenophore formed
on resupinate, effused-reflexed to p ileate or stipitate carpophores. These carpo -
phores vary greatly in their nature, arrangement and morphology, and develop
gymnocarpically with a unilateral hymenium lining the tubes. Polypores offera great variation in their hyphal construc tion, basidia and basidiospores. These
fungi have been placed in various orders of Agaricomycetes (Si & Dai 2016). The
diversity of these fungi in India has been explored from time to time with some

dive et al. (2011), Sharma (2012), Ranadive (2013) and Kaur et al. (2017).
Based on macro- and micro-morphological features and comparison with the
literature, five species of four polypore genera were identified as new to India.The aim of the present study is to describe and illustrate these five species withremarks about their distribution.

ATERIAL AND METHODS
The polypore samples were collected during mycofloristic surveys conducted
during the rainy season of the years 2015 and 2016 at localities of the Sirmaur Dis -
trict in Himachal Pradesh and Patiala D istrict in Punjab (India). The carpophores
were carefully isolated from their substrate using a chisel and a hammer. Datapertaining to habitat, hos t/substrate, carpophores texture, colour and type of
hymenial/abhymenial surface and margins were noted carefully for each col -
lected specimen. The specimens were dried either in the sun or using a portable
electric drier. The dried specimens were packed following the standard protocols
and were conserved with fumigants like 1,4-dichlorobenzene.
The macroscopic characters of the carpophores collected were studied by
making crush mounts and free hand cut sections in water and 3%, 5% and 10%KOH solutions and stained in cotton blue (1% in lactophenol), Congo red (1% indistilled water), phloxine (1% in distilled w ater) and Melzer’s reagent (0.5g iodine
+ 1.5g KI + 20g chloral hydrate + 20ml distilled water). The outlines of the micro-scopic structures were drawn in the form of line diagrams with a camera lucidaat different magnifications (100×, 400× and 1000×) of the compound microscope.
The macro- and microscopic characters were compiled into descriptions
which were compared with monographic compilations (Ryvarden 2002, Sharma2012, Ryvarden & Melo 2014) for identification. The colour of the hymenial/ab -
hymenial surface is cited according to Kornerup & Wanscher (1978). All the sam -
ples studied and described have been deposited into the Herbarium, Department
of Botany, Punjabi University, Patiala (PUN).
