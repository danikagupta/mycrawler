ABSTRACT
Background . Dye wastewater increases cancer risk in humans. For the treatment
of dyestuffs, biodegradation has the advantages of economy, high efficiency, and
environmental protection compared with traditional physical and chemical methods.
Laccase is the best candidate for dye degradation because of its multiple substrates and
pollution-free products.
Methods . Here, we modified the laccase gene of Bacillus licheniformis by error-prone
PCR and site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in E. coli . The protein was purified
by His-tagged protein purification kit. We tested the enzymatic properties of wild type
and mutant laccase by single factor test, and further evaluated the decolorization ability
of laccase to acid violet, alphazurine A, and methyl orange by spectrophotometry.
Results . Mutant laccase Lacep69and D500G were superior to wild type laccase in enzyme
activity, stability, and decolorization ability. Moreover, the laccase D500G obtained by
site-directed mutagenesis had higher enzyme activity in both, and the specific activity
of the purified enzyme was as high as 426.13 U/mg. Also, D500G has a higher optimum
temperature of 70C and temperature stability, while it has a more neutral pH 4.5 and
pH stability. D500G had the maximum enzyme activity at a copper ion concentration
of 12 mM. The results of decolorization experiments showed that D500G had a strong
overall decolorization ability, with a lower decolorization rate of 18% for methyl orange
and a higher decolorization rate of 78% for acid violet.
Conclusion . Compared with the wild type laccase, the enzyme activity of D500G was
significantly increased. At the same time, it has obvious advantages in the decolorization
effect of different dyes. Also, the advantages of temperature and pH stability increase
its tolerance to the environment of dye wastewater.

INTRODUCTION
Laccases (phenol-oxygen oxidoreductase; EC 1.10.3.2), a copper-containing polyphenol
oxidase, belong to the superfamily of blue poly copper oxidases (MCOs) ( Morozova et
al., 2007 ;Hakulinen & Rouvinen, 2015 ). Laccase was first discovered in the permeate of
Rhus vernicifera (Legrand & Martin, 1958 ). Thereafter, they were also found in plants,

from Bacillus licheniformis by random and site-directed mutagenesis. PeerJ 8:e10267 http://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.10267fungi, bacteria, and insects ( Chakroun et al., 2010 ;Forootanfar et al., 2011 ;Halaburgi et al.,
2011). There are many studies on fungal laccase and bacterial laccase. White rot fungi
of the basidiomycete family are mostly studied in laccase-producing fungi. At present,
it has been found that bacterial laccase mainly comes from Bacillus sp. (Mollania et al.,
2011;Chen et al., 2017 ), Streptomyces ( Freeman et al., 1993 ), and Pseudomonas ( Francis
& Tebo, 2001 ). Laccases can catalyze phenols, polyphenols ( Koschorreck et al., 2008 ;Zeng
et al., 2011 ;Revanth, Niranjan & Sarma, 2020 ), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, certain
inorganic substances, and more. As a result, they are widely used for the decolorization
of synthetic dyes ( Pereira et al., 2009 ;Mendes et al., 2011 ), synthesis of organic substances,
food processing, biosensor ( Zhang et al., 2019 ), and other fields. The molecular structure
of laccase contains four copper ions. There are three types based on magnetic and spectral
properties: Type 1 (T1), Type 2 (T2), and type 3 (T3) copper ions. T1 Cu2C, located at
the substrate-binding site, is responsible for transferring substrate electrons ( Martins et al.,
2015). T2 Cu2Cand T3 Cu2Care located at the oxygen molecule binding site, where oxygen
molecules combine with electrons to generate water ( Sakurai & Kataoka, 2007 ;Sakurai &
Kataoka, 2010 ).
Dye wastewater has become one of the main hazardous industrial sewage due to a large
number of dyes and intermediates. According to chemical properties, dyes are divided into
reactive dyes, acid dyes, basic dyes, disperse dyes, vat dyes, sulfur dyes, mordants, direct
dyes, naphthol dyes, solvent dyes, and organic pigments ( Bhatia et al., 2017 ). Synthetic
dyes with strong carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as raw materials have
become more commonly used dyes in the printing and dyeing industry because of their
stable physical and chemical properties and low cost. Wastewater from the printing
and dyeing industry is discharged into freshwater without treatment, which seriously
affects the growth of aquatic organisms and microorganisms ( Mishra & Maiti, 2018 ), and
destroys the self-purification of water bodies ( Tkaczyk, Mitrowska & Posyniak, 2020 ;Gowri,
Vijayarghavan & Meenambigai, 2014 ). At the same time, azo and anthraquinone dyes will
produce a variety of carcinogenic aromatic amines during specific decomposition, which
can cause cancer, mutagenesis, and reproductive toxicity ( Ali et al., 2019 ). The objects of
this study are both azo (methyl orange, alphazurine A) and anthraquinone (acid violet)
dyes that are acid.
In terms of dye degradation, white rot fungal laccase has many problems, such as a long
culture period and high cost. Therefore, researchers turned their attention to bacterial
laccase. ( Michniewicz et al., 2008 ;Hadibarata et al., 2012 ;Tian et al., 2014 ;Zheng et al.,
2017;Legersk√°, Chmelov√° & Ondrejovi¬£, 2018 ). In 1993, Givaudan first detected laccase
activity in Awspirillum lipoferum (Givaudan et al., 1993 ). Numerous studies have shown
that certain bacterial laccases, such as CotA laccases from Bacillus capsid protein, are more
tolerant than fungal laccase in neutral or alkaline environments. ( Zhang et al., 2012 ;Lu et
al., 2012 ;Guan et al., 2014 ;Martins et al., 2015 ;Wang et al., 2016 ). This bacterial laccase is
more suitable for the environment of dye wastewater and exhibits higher enzyme activity.
However, the enzyme activity of a crude enzyme solution of wild bacterial laccase is often
lower. Direct modification of proteins is an effective way to improve enzyme activity and
stability ( Chen et al., 2017 ). This technology mainly includes two strategies: rational design

and directed evolution. Rational designs are usually based on computer-aided structural
modeling of enzyme proteins, using site-directed mutation techniques, knockout, and
insertions of protein sequences to alter the properties and functions of the target protein.
Finally, target protein properties were analyzed by measuring enzyme activity. Directed
evolution aims to construct a set of random gene transformations in vitro by mimicking
natural evolution, and then select target proteins through library construction and high-
throughput screening. It can be achieved by error-prone PCR and DNA recombination
techniques ( Bornscheuer & Pohl, 2001 ;Berman, 2008 ).
Here, we used a laboratory-constructed plasmid containing laccase constructed by
Bacillus licheniformis as a template, modified target genes by error-prone PCR and site-
directed mutation, screened mutants with higher enzyme activity, and further evaluated
the decolorization ability of wild-type and mutant laccase to dyes.

Enzyme activity assay
Laccase oxidation reaction was carried out at 50C in vitro, using ABTS as a substrate.
In a solution containing 50 mM tartaric acid buffer (pH 3.0), 1 mM ABTS and 1 mM
CuCl 2300mL of enzyme solution was added to three mL of reaction system. After 5 min
of reaction, the absorbance at 420 nm was measured. Under the above conditions, the
amount of enzyme required to oxidize 1 mmol of ABTS per minute is defined as one unit
of enzyme activity (U). The assay was performed in quadruplicate. According to the study
of Lu et al., some modifications were made to the enzyme activity determination method
(Lu et al., 2012 ).

Error-Prone PCR
The laccase gene of B. licheniformis was randomly mutated by using the constructed
recombinant plasmid pET- Laccontaining the Lacgene as the template and adding the
specific primers containing the enzyme cutting site (Table 2). (Note: The error-prone
PCR kit is only suitable for reactions with a gene length of less than 1,000 bp, but the Lac
gene is 1,542 bp, so segmented PCR is performed). The mutant laccase gene was ligated
with the linearized vector pET-30b (+) to form the recombinant plasmid pET- Lacep, then
transformed into E. coli BL21 competent cells, and then the positive transformants were
Bu et al. (2020), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.10267 4/21screened with LB medium containing ampicillin. Using ABTS as a substrate, a 96-well plate
method was used to screen mutants with laccase activity. Positive clones were sequentially
added to 96-well plates for overnight culture, in which 200 mL of resistance medium was
added to the wells beforehand. The 10 mL culture was added to a new 96-well plate in
turn and incubated for 4 h using IPTG induction. After the culture, the bacteria were
precipitated at 80C and repeatedly frozen and thawed three times. The bacteria were
resuspended with Tri-HCl and lysed with lysozyme, and the lysate was centrifuged to
obtain the supernatant. Enzyme activity of the supernatant was determined and mutants
with higher enzyme activity were screened.
Site-directed mutagenesis
Forward and reverse mutation primers Lac-D-F and Lac-D-R were designed using the
fast site-directed mutagenesis kit. Using plasmid pET- Laccontaining Lacas a template
amplified mutant Lac. PCR products were digested using 1 mLDpnI enzyme (20 U/ mL) at
37C for 1 h. The DpnI enzyme can digest methylated templates. After treatment with Dpn
I enzyme, it was then transformed into FDM competent cells. All mutants were screened
and further confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmids containing the desired mutations
were then transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) for protein expression.
Expression and PuriÔ¨Åcation of laccases
E. coli BL21 (DE3) containing WT laccases gene ( Lac) and mutant laccase genes ( Lacep69
andD500G ) were cultured overnight in 10 mL LB medium containing ampicillin (100
mg/mL) at 37C with shaking (180 rpm). Afterward, the overnight pre-culture was
inoculated into a fresh 50 mL culture medium (1% inoculation) containing ampicillin
(100 mg/mL) and incubated at 37C with shaking (180 rpm) until an optical density at
600 nm (OD 600) of 0.6 was reached. Then, isopropyl- -D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)
was added to the culture medium to a final concentration of 0.1 mM, and the culture was
induced at 16C, 100 rpm. Samples were taken every two hours and 12% SDS-PAGE was
used to detect the expression of target proteins ( Laemmli, 1970 ). Meanwhile, E. coli BL21
cells containing empty vector pET-30b (+) were used as control. Centrifuge (10 min, 8,
000g, 4C) to collect induced bacterial cells. Cells were crushed on ice and centrifuged
(20 min, 8, 000g, 4C) to remove cell debris. Then, the supernatant was treated at 70C
for 15 min, and the denatured protein was removed by centrifugation (10 min, 10, 000 
g, 4C) (Koschorreck, Schmid & Urlacher, 2009 ;Nasoohi et al., 2013 ).
Based on the histidine tag carried on the vector pET-30b (+), we purified the recombinant
laccase using the His-tagged protein purification kit. Then, according to the SDS-PAGE
results, the pure enzyme solution was desalted by Amicon ultrafiltration (membrane
retention value: 10 kDa; Millipore, Billerica, Ma, USA). According to Bradford's method,
bovine serum albumin was used to make the protein standard curve, and the protein
content of purified laccase was determined ( Bradford, 1976 ).

Optimum temperature and thermal stability
Optimum temperature and temperature stability of purified laccase activity were assessed
by relative enzyme activity measured at different temperatures. The enzyme activity of
laccase at different temperatures was measured after incubation at 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80,
85, 90, 95, and 100C for 1 h under standard conditions, and the enzyme activity measured
at 4C was defined as 100%.
Optimum pH and pH stability
Optimum pH and pH stability of purified laccase activity were assessed by relative enzyme
activity measured at pH 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5 under standard conditions,
respectively. The pH of the enzyme reaction system was adjusted by 0.05 M citric acid-
Na2HPO 4buffer to 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, and incubated at 4C
overnight to measure the enzyme activity at different pH. The enzyme activity measured
under pH 4 was defined as 100%, and the relative enzyme activity was calculated.
Copper ion concentration
To detect the effect of copper ion concentration on laccase activity, CuCl 2solution with
a final concentration of 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2.0 mM was added to
the reaction system, and laccase activity was determined under the optimum reaction
conditions. The relative enzyme activity was calculated by taking the laccase enzyme
activity measured under the same reaction system without adding CuCl 2solution was
determined to be 100%. The data were processed and analyzed using Origin 8.0 software.
The decolorization rate calculation formula is shown in Eq. (2).

Dye decolorization
The decolorization ability of Lac, Lacep69, and D500G was tested with three dyes of acid
violet (max=600 nm), alphazurine A ( max=637 nm), and methyl orange ( max=470 nm).
Add 100 mg/mL purified enzyme protein, dye (40 mg/L acid violet, 20 mg/L alphazurine
A, 20 mg/L methyl orange) and 1 mM CuCl 2to tartaric acid buffer (0.1 M, pH 4.0) for
decolorization reaction. Samples were taken and centrifuged regularly (12,000 rpm, 2
min), and the decolorization effect was determined by spectrophotometry. All reactions
are performed in quadruplicate.

Statistical analysis
Quadruplicate in experiments was conducted on each sample to ensure good repeatability.
Statistical Program of Social Science (SPSS 17.0, Chicago, IL, USA) software was used for
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) by using Duncan's test of the data to complete the
significant difference test, at a significant level of P<0:05.
RESULTS
Expression and puriÔ¨Åcation of wild-type and mutant laccases
Nucleotide sequencing of the plasmid extracted from the positive transformant confirmed
thatLac's ORF contains 1,542 bp that theoretically encode 513 amino acids with a molecular
weight of about 60 kDa. (Data S1) The protein sequence has a 99% identity to the Lacgene
ofB. licheniformis (MK427697.1).
The results of SDS-PAGE showed that the enzyme expression reached the highest level,
after 10 h of IPTG induction. Because the expression level increases from 2 to10 h, 10 to
12 h tends to remain unchanged. The results were shown in Fig. 1. After 10 h of induction,
the cells were sonicated and purified. SDS-PAGE electrophoresis results of the purified
product, intracellular supernatant, and cell debris are shown in Fig. 2. We found that
under low temperature and low concentration inducer conditions, the recombinant Lac
was mainly expressed in a soluble state but has a low content in the precipitate. And after
purification, a single band can be obtained (Lane 1). Using ABTS as the substrate, the
specific activity of the purified Lac was 121.75 U/mg.
Here, we used a 96-well plate method to screen a mutant strain Lacep69with higher
enzyme activity than Lac, from the mutated Lac gene library generated by error-prone
PCR. The mutant strain Lacep69's specific activity is 51.24 U/mg, which was 1.35 times
higher than that of the wild strain 37.84 U/mg. After the alignment of multiple laccase
gene sequences, we found a conserved aspartic acid at position 500 of the laccase, replacing
aspartic acid with glycine to carry out the targeted modification of laccase (The data isn't
displayed). The specific activity of Lacep69was 170.45 U/mg, and D500G was 426.13 U/mg.

Characterization of the puriÔ¨Åed wild-type and mutated laccases
Optimal pH and pH stability
The optimized pH and pH stability results of Lac, Lacep69, D500G after purification are
shown in Figs. 3A, 3B. Lacep69and Lac have the same optimal pH of 4.0, while D500G is
more neutral than Lac, with a pH increase of 0.5. Figure 3B shows that at a pH of 4.05.5,
the relative enzyme activity of Lacep69after 1 h of incubation is stable above 75%, while the
relative enzyme activity of D500G after 1 h of incubation at 4.56.5 is stable above 80%. In
contrast, D500G has higher enzyme activity and stability in a neutral environment.
Optimum temperature and temperature stability
Tested the optimal temperature and temperature stability of Lac, Lacep69, D500G results
as shown in Figs. 3C, 3D. The optimum temperature for both Lacep69and D500G was
higher than Lac, which was 80 and 70C respectively. Their temperature stability is high.
After incubating at 50  80C for 1 h, Lacep69enzyme activity remained above 80%, while
D500G enzyme activity remained above 85%. It indicated that mutants were more tolerant
of temperature than the wild type, had higher enzyme activity in higher temperature
environments, and were more suitable for enzyme industrialization. Besides, when the
temperature increased to 85C the enzyme activity of Lac, Lacep69, and D500G showed
a rapid decline trend, indicating that excessive temperature denatured the enzyme and
inactivated it.
Copper ion concentration
Tested the effect of different concentrations of copper ions on enzyme activity. As shown
in Fig. 4, when the concentration of copper ions in the reaction system was 12 mM, the
activity of wild-type laccase reached its peak. However, the mutant strains Lacep69and

 DOI: 10.7717/peerj.10267/fig-3
D500G only need 10 mM copper ion concentration to achieve maximum enzyme activity.
This indicated that the mutant was more sensitive to copper ions than the wild type Lac.
Km value determination
Km represents the magnitude of the affinity of the enzyme to the substrate. The larger
theKm, the smaller the affinity of the enzyme and the substrate, the lower the enzyme
activity. We used Origin8.0 software to predict the km of Lac, Lacep69, and D500G after
purification. The Km value of engineered bacteria Lac, mutant strains Lacep69and D500G
was 21.69 mM, 19.54 mM, and 10.50 mM respectively, the trends were consistent with the
previous experimental of the enzyme protein activity determination, which showed that
the increase in affinity leads to the increase in enzyme activity.
Dye decolorization assays by laccase
Figures 5A5C show the decolorization of dyes by within 6 h. First, the rapid reaction
phases of Lac, Lacep69, and D500G were all 01 h. Secondly, the degradation rates of the
two mutant enzymes were significantly better than those of the wild type. And D500G has
the best decolorization ability. The decolorization rate of Lac to three dyes: methyl orange
15%, alphazurine A 30%, and acid violet 40%. The decolorization rate of D500G for three
dyes: methyl orange 18%, alphazurine A 70%, and acid violet 78%.
As shown in Figs. 5A5C, the enzymatic reaction within 01 h belongs to the rapid
reaction period, and the enzyme activity is relatively less affected at this time. Therefore,
we compared the decolorization of the three dyes by the wild type and the mutant within

1 h. The result is shown in Fig. 5D. There are differences in the decolorization rates of
different dyes by laccase. Lac, Lacep69, and D500G all have lower degradation rates for
methyl orange, but higher degradation rates for alphazurine A and acid violet. For the
three dyes, the degradation efficiency of the mutant is always better than that of the wild
type. Especially D500G shows a significantly enhanced degradation rate for all three dyes.
From the perspective of enzyme activity, the higher enzyme activity of D500G provides the
possibility for dye degradation.
Analysis of laccase protein structure
The results of the primary structure show that compared with the original Lac, the mutant
strain Lacep69has six pairs of base changes (T811C, A944G, T998C, T1303C, A1389C,
and T1440A) in the sequence. Correspondingly, the six pairs of amino acids (Cys271Arg,
Lys315Arg, Ile333Thr, Phe435Leu, Lys463Asn, Phe480Leu) in Lacep69have also changed.
The results of Prote-Param analysis of Lac, Lacep69, and D500G are shown in Table 3.
First, D500G and Lacep69are stable proteins. According to the stability coefficient data,
Lac (40.03)>Lacep69(39.57)>D500G (39.40). It is noteworthy that D500G has the highest
stability. The change of the protein's primary structure will affect its spatial structure,
which will affect the intermolecular forces and steric hindrance to varying degrees, thereby
changing the stability of the protein. Also, the increase in stability provides theoretical
support for the increase in the enzyme activity of D500G. Secondly, wild-type and mutant
laccase proteins have similar molecular weights and are both hydrophilic proteins, although
the hydrophilicity of Lacep69and D500G is slightly decreased. Amino acid changes, before
and after mutation, led to hydrophilic amino acids were replaced by hydrophobic amino
acids, hydrophobic R groups to a certain extent weakened the hydrophilicity of enzyme
proteins. The difference marks are highlighted in circles in Fig. 6.
SOPMA results show that Lac, Lacep69, and D500G have similar secondary structures,
and they are mainly composed of random coils. The results are shown in Fig. 7. Compared
with the wild type, the proportion of -helix in the mutant is increased and the random
coil is decreased. Lac has 61.4% random coils, 8.19% -helix, 5.26% -turns, and 25.15%
extended chains. Lacep69has 60.62% random curl, 9.36% -helix, 4.29% -turn, and
25.73% extended chain. D500G has 59.45% random curl, 8.58% -helix, 5.85% -turn,
and 26.12% extended chain. Due to the change of amino acids, the proportion of -helix
increases, the random curl decreases, and other structural changes are small.

that the amino acid at position 463 appears on the random curl, and the others are in the
-turn. The tertiary structure of Lacep69is similar to Lac. However, the -helix and -turn
angles of D500G are reduced, and the structure shows a loose transition state, in which the

amino acid at position 500 appears on the -turn angle. The mutated base is located near
the active center of the enzyme, which may increase the activity of the enzyme. Lac, Lacep69,
and D500G mutation sites are shown in Fig. 9. Overall, the number of Lacep69hydrogen
bonds didn't change. Changes in amino acids affect the distribution of the atomic electron
cloud around the atom. Changes in the electron cloud and hydrogen bonds may be one of
the reasons affecting the enzyme activity of laccase.
DISCUSSION
The crude laccase enzyme activity of the original B. licheniformis in this study was only
11.99 U/mg, which is because the endogenous expression level of most bacterial laccases
is relatively low ( Chen et al., 2015 ). While heterologous expression of laccase is one of the
effective ways to solve this poser. The low expression level of wild-type laccase is the key
to the low activity of the crude enzyme solution of B. licheniformis . Also, laccase belongs
to intracellular localization, E. coli expression system is a better choice ( Wu et al., 2010 ).
So, we obtained a 1.37-fold increase in the expression of recombinant laccase Lac by
heterologous expression in E. coli , but its enzyme activity was still lower. The intracellular
enzyme may greatly reduce its original enzyme activity during the process of isolation and
purification due to physical damage, inducer, and improper operation. Through directed
evolution, two mutant laccases Lacep69and D500G with improved enzyme activity were
obtained. Among them, obtained by site-directed mutation has higher enzyme activity,
stability, and catalytic efficiency. This result is similar to that of some Bacillus spp. ( Wang,
Lu & Feng, 2017 ;Liu et al., 2011 ).
Whether it is random mutagenesis or site-directed mutation, changes in amino acid will
affect the spatial structure of the protein, which in turn affects the nature and function of
the protein. Studies have shown that factors such as the proportion of certain amino acids,
protein accumulation, hydrophobicity, increased helical fold content, internal hydrogen
bonding and density of salt bridges, and the distribution of charged residues on the surface
are important factors that affect protein thermal stability ( Kumar & Nussinov, 2001 ;Sterner
& Liebl, 2001 ).

Lacep69mutated 6 amino acid positions, and cysteine at position 271 was mutated
to basic arginine, which may affect the optimal pH of the enzyme. The mutation of its
non-polar isoleucine at position 333 to polar threonine may affect the hydrophobicity of
the protein. The change in hydrophobicity, in turn, affects the stability of the protein.
Besides, the stability of protein structure is closely related to hydrogen bonds, because
1 mol of hydrogen bonds can provide 0.6 calories of energy to maintain the stability of
protein structure. The improvement of hydrogen bond introduced by the amino acid
mutation at position 271 of Lacep69is one of the important roles of enzyme protein stability
(Mabrouk et al., 2011 ). The cysteine at position 271 and the lysine at position 315 of Lac
ep69are both mutated to arginine. Arginine can participate in a variety of non-covalent
bond interactions, and its side chain can provide more space for charge interactions. These
factors further improve the stability of the enzyme ( KnoChel et al., 1996 ). D500G's acidic
amino acid, aspartic acid, becomes glycine, and the change in the optimal pH may be
related to the change in the polarity of the amino acid. The side chain of aspartic acid
is ``-CH 2COOH'' and the side chain of glycine is hydrogen atom ``-H''. After the laccase

bonds, which may collide with atoms in Thr at 313; Lacep69's 315 Arg and Tyr at 264 forms two hydro-
gen bonds. Lac's Phe at 435 forms a hydrogen bond with Ile at position 437 and Gly at position 471; Lac
Lacep69's Leu at position 435 forms a hydrogen bond with Ile at position 437, which may collide with an
atom in Gly at position 437. Lac's aspartic acid at position 500 and leucine at position 385, tryptophan
at position 392 and methionine at position 502 each form a hydrogen bond; glycine at position 500 of
D500G and the methionine at position 502 each forms a hydrogen bond, and the atoms in histidine at po-
sition 496 may collide.

mutation, the flexibility of the N-C and C-C framework changes, the binding force between
the enzyme and the substrate becomes stronger, and the enzyme activity improves. Changes
in properties caused by the 500 amino acid change have also been found in other bacterial
laccases ( Koschorreck, Schmid & Urlacher, 2009 ;Nasoohi et al., 2013 ).
Bu et al. (2020), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.10267 15/21The secondary and tertiary structure predictions show that Lac, Lacep69, and D500G are
similar in structure, with little difference in physical and chemical properties. In general,
the mutants only form certain secondary bonds in the structure, and the distribution of the
electron cloud is slightly changed, but the sites that play a key role in the function of the
enzyme are not changed. It is noteworthy that D500G differs greatly from Lac in secondary
structure, which may be one of the reasons for its higher thermal stability and higher
enzyme activity. Because the type and number of intramolecular forces usually affect the
thermal stability and catalytic activity of enzyme molecules ( Xie et al., 2014 ).
After analyzing the degradation of different kinds of dyes, it is found that wild-type
and mutant laccases generally have lower degradation rates for methyl orange and higher
degradation rates for acid violet. From the analysis of enzyme specificity, laccase has
different specificities for dye molecules of different structures, and the degree of specific
binding between the enzyme and the substrate determines the degradation effect of the
substrate. The anthraquinone structure of acid violet belongs to the substrate dye of bacterial
laccase laccase in this study, but has a low specificity with azo methyl orange ( Yaropolov
et al., 1994 ;Galai, Youssoufi & Marzouki, 2014 ). From the perspective of mutants, D500G
has the highest degradation rate for the three dyes among the three enzymes. The reasons
for this result come from three aspects. First, from the molecular level, the mutation site
of D500G structurally enhances its stability, which in turn affects its enzyme activity;
second, the structural change affects the affinity between the enzyme and the substrate,
andKm value is powerful evidence. According to the enzyme kinetic theory, the Km value
is negatively correlated with the substrate affinity, and among the three, the Km value of
D500G is the smallest, which is 10.50 0.32 mM.
From the temperature analysis, the optimal temperature of the mutant is significantly
improved, and high-temperature tolerance is also significantly increased. D500G still
preserves more than 85% of the enzyme activity after being stored at a high temperature of
50 80C for one hour, which provides strong evidence for the improvement of the stability
of the mutant. From the perspective of pH analysis, the optimum pH of D500G becomes
larger, and at the same time, it still retains more than 80% of the enzyme activity after
being stored at 4.05.5 for one hour. The improvement of temperature and pH tolerance
increased the tolerance of D500G in dyes, and at the same time reducing the impact of the
environment on enzyme activity, thereby increasing the mutant's degradation rate of dyes.
The results of Figs. 5A5C also proved that the mutant has a higher degradation rate in the
first hour of the dye degradation process, and tends to end after 1 h. It is speculated that
the enzyme activity of the laccase in 1 h is due to various reasons. The reduction ultimately
leads to a decrease in its degradation rate.
CONCLUSION
In this study, we successfully screened a mutant laccase D500G with significantly improved
decolorization of dyes by site-directed mutagenesis. Compared with wild-type laccase,
D500G has significantly improved temperature and pH stability, which further enhances
the tolerance of laccase in the dye wastewater environment and is more suitable for practical
industrial production.
