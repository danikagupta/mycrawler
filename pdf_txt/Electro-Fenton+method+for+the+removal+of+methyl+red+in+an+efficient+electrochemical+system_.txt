  4    5 ABSTRACT  
 
Electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) constitute an e fficient technology to treat the 
pharmaceuticals as they allow the formation of strong oxidants such as  hydroxyl radicals able to remove 
nearly any type of organic contaminants thanks to their very high oxidation power . Among them the 
electro -Fenton and anodic oxidation processes are environmentally friendly me thods as they use no 
chemical reagent (anodic oxidation) or only oxygen of air and iron ions as a catalyst (electro-Fenton).  
In this thesis, four pharmaceuticals from different families a nd structures were selected based on their 
toxicity and their occurrence in environmental waters and their removal  from water was performed by 
EAOPs. The objectives of this work were to determine the best ope rating conditions at lab scale (current 
and catalyst concentration), investigate the kinetic of degradation and mineralization and finally propose 
a mineralization pathway based on aromatic intermediates, ca rboxylic acids and ions released to the 
solution. 
As these treatments were successfully applied, a lab scale pilot reactor composed alternately of BDD 
anodes and carbon felt cathodes with a bottom aeration system and working i n the continuous mode was 
built to scale-up these processes in order to pre-industrialize them. Different configurations of electrodes 
were tested. The flow rate and the current were found to be more i nfluent on the mineralization rate and 
on the energy consumption, respectively. To deeper understand the role of the  flow rate and the 
configurations a hydrodynamic study was performed. The hydrodynamic results we re gathered with a 
kinetic model for the mineralization to obtain a model predicting the percentage of mineralization at 
different position inside the reactor during the steady state. Th us, this model can help to optimize the 
operating conditions and to size future reactors depending on the miner alization objective of the 
treatment (high mineralization rate, combined treatment, high flow , …).  
To reduce operating cost, the combination of an electrochemical proce ss and a biological treatment was 
then investigated. In this frame, it was found that electrochemic al treatment can (i) degrade the 
hydrochlorothiazide (ii) reduce significantly the concentration of its a romatic intermediates as they were 
shown to significantly inhibit the bacterial activity, (iii) promo te the formation of biodegradable 
molecules such as carboxylic acids. The biodegradation of four carboxylic acids formed during the 
electro -Fenton treatment of the hydrochlorothiazide at lab scale was also studied. It was demonstrated 
that they were sequentially degraded with different lag phases and kinetics of degradation. Thus to 
mineralize them, a “plug flow” type reactor is recommended. The combination of treatment was then 
applied with an electrochemical treatment performed at low curre nt with a BDD anode and a Platine 
anode. A mineralization degree of 38% and 50% were obtained by the biologica l treatment enabling to 
globally reach a mineralization rate of 66% and 85% with the BDD and t he Platine anodes respectively. 
Thus this combined treatment was successful and open the way for the  scale-up of these processes.  
 
 
 
   6 RESUME  
 
Les procédés électrochimiques d'oxydation avancée constituent une technologi e efficace pour traiter les 
produits pharmaceutiques car ils permettent la formation d'oxydants puiss ants tels que les radicaux 
hydroxyles capables d'éliminer presque tout type de contaminants organiques grâ ce à leur très haut 
pouvoir oxydant. Parmi eux, l’ électro -Fenton et l’oxydation anodique sont des méthodes respectueuses 
de l'environnement car ils n'utilisent aucun réactif chimique (oxydation anodique) ou uniquement 
l'oxygène de l'air et des ions fer en tant que catalyseur (électro -Fenton). 
Dans cette thèse, quatre produits pharmaceutiques appartenant à des f amilles différentes ont été 
sélectionnés en fonction de leur toxicité et de leur présence dans le s eaux de l'environnement. Leur 
élimination de l'eau a été effectuée par électro-Fenton. Les objectifs de ce travail étaient de déterminer 
(i) les meilleures conditions opératoires à l’échelle du laboratoire (courant et concentration du 
catalyseur), (ii) la cinétique de dégradation et de minéralisation et enfin (iii) de proposer une voie de 
minéralisation basée sur des intermédiaires aromatiques, des a cides carboxyliques et des ions libérés 
dans la solution. 
Comme ces traitements ont été appliqués avec succès, un réacte ur pilote composé alternativement 
d'anodes en BDD et de cathodes en feutre de carbone, doté d’un système  d'aération et fonctionnant en 
mode continu a été construit pour évaluer la faisabilité d’un changement d’échelle et se diriger vers une 
pré-industrialisation du procédé. Différentes configurations d'électrode s ont été testées. Le débit et le 
courant se sont avérés être plus influents sur le taux de minérali sation et sur la consommation d'énergie, 
respectivement. Pour mieux comprendre le rôle du débit et des configura tions, une étude 
hydrodynamique a été réalisée. Le modèle hydrodynamique a été associé à  un modèle cinétique de 
minéralisation afin d'obtenir un modèle permettant de prédire le pourc entage de minéralisation à 
différentes positions à l'intérieur du réacteur en régime permane nt. Ainsi, ce modèle peut aider à 
optimiser les conditions opératoires et à dimensionner les futurs r éacteurs en fonction de l’objectif de 
minéralisation du traitement (taux de minéralisation élevé, tr aitement combiné, flux élevé,…). 
Afin de réduire les coûts opératoires, la combinaison d’un procédé électrochimique et d’un traitement 
biologique a ensuite été étudiée. Afin d’obtenir un traitement combiné e fficace, il a été constaté que le 
traitement électrochimique devait (i) dégrader l'hydrochlorothiazide (ii) réduire de manière significative 
la concentration de ses intermédiaires aromatiques car ils inhibe nt de manière significative l'activité 
bactérienne, (iii) favoriser la formation de molécules biodégradable s telles que les acides carboxyliques. 
La biodégradation de quatre acides carboxyliques formés lors du traiteme nt par électro-Fenton de 
l'hydrochlorothiazide a également été étudiée. Il a été démontré qu'i ls étaient dégradés de manière 
séquentielle avec différentes phases de latence et cinétiques de dégradation. Ainsi, pour les minéraliser, 
un réacteur de type «piston» est recommandé. La combinaison de traite ment a ensuite été appliquée à 
un traitement électrochimique effectué à faible courant avec une a node en BDD et une anode en Platine. 
Un degré de minéralisation de 38 et 50% a été obtenu par le trait ement biologique permettant d'atteindre 
un taux de minéralisation global de 66 et 85% avec les anodes en BDD et Platine respectivement. Ainsi, 
cette combinaison de traitement a été un succès, un changement d’échelle du procédé peut alors être 
envisagé.

Nowadays, the treatment of pharmaceuticals has become a hot topic a s they are widely 
consumed all over the world. A strong increase in the consumption of phar maceuticals has been 
observed during the last decades. In the US, IMS Health mentioned an i ncrease of the sales 
from $152,8 to $280 billion which represents a 83% rise between 2000 and 2006  (Khetan and 
Collins 2007; Bouissou-Schurtz et al. 2014; Vergili et al. 2019) . This increase can be explained 
by several factors such as: (i)  population growth, (ii) population age ing, (iii) discovery of new 
properties of already existing drugs and (iv) decreasing price of drugs a s patents expire 
(Daughton 2003).  
As analytical chemistry techniques were improved during last years, e specially in the limit of 
quantification, the presence of pharmaceutics was detected in natur al water thus proving their 
non-effective elimination by wastewater treatment plants (WWTP ), since concentrations 
ranging from ng L-1 to µg L-1 were usually found in natural water bodies (Lindsey et al. 2001; 
Bouissou-Schurtz et al. 2014) . Indeed, in addition to the industrial and hospital effluents, these 
products are also released to urban wastewater whole or partly degra ded after human and 
veterinary uses (Lindsey et al. 2001; Verlicchi et al. 2010) . Pharmaceutical compounds are not 
efficiently eliminated by WWTP or by natural elimination proces ses in the environment 
(Laurencé et al. 2014). Several review papers provide a snapshot o f the removal efficiency of 
some selected pharmaceutical molecules achieved in WWTPs (Miè ge et al., 2009 ; Gabet-
Giraud et al., 2010; Luo et al., 2014). 
Pharmaceuticals include lots of different compounds; they can be cla ssified in to groups aiming 
at doing the same action. The most important ones are the nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory drugs 
and analgesics, the antibiotics, the β-blockers and diuretics, the neuroactive compounds, the 
stero id hormones and the lipid regulators…  20 • Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and analgesics: this group includes m ore than 
one hundred compounds (Feng et al. 2013). They are used as inflammatory re ducer 
and analgesic; their high concentration in natural water can be ex plained by the fact 
that they do not need a prescription, allowing very great use.  
• Antibiotics: their role is to kill bacteria or/and inhibit their  multiplications. This group 
is composed of a huge number of molecules. 
• Beta blockers: they are part of the most important prescription dr ugs all over the world 
and used in cardiovascular disease, which is a more and more common probl em, and 
in relieving chest pain (Khetan and Collins, 2007) .  
• Diuretic: they are used for anti-hypertensive medications.   
 
Pharmaceuticals are ubiquitous in the environment  
As pharmaceuticals have been detected in the environment, it is important to quantify their 
extent in environmental water. To estimate the concentration of pha rmaceuticals in an effluent 
two main techniques are used: i) direct measure of the pollutant i n the effluent (Table 2) and ii) 
use of PEC (Predicted Environment Concentration), a calculation to p redict the concentration 
of a pollutant in an effluent based on approximations. The PEC is usuall y based on the fraction 
of active ingredient excreted in urine and feces but all the formul as are different and linked to 
their specific situations. For the different types of pharmaceutic als, it appears that for most of 
compounds, the PEC is higher than the concentration measured in the sam e condition, 
indicating that the PEC values are overestimated (Besse et al . 2008; Kümmerer 2009a; Escher 
et al. 2011; Sim et al. 2011; Bouissou-Schurtz et al. 2014; Gabet-Gi raud et al. 2014; Mendoza 
et al. 2015; Al Qarni et al. 2016) .  
As can be seen in Table 2, b-blocker, NSAIDs and analgesics and antibiotics are present in  21 higher concentrations than diuretics both in surface water and in hospital wastewater. Among 
them, Atenolol and Metoprolol, Ibuprofen, Ciprofloxacin and Erythromycin ha ve the highest 
concentrations. However, these results are very specific and cannot  be expanded to other 
countries or even other regions.  
 
Pharmaceuticals have harmful effect to living species 
Besides measuring or predicting the concentration of pharmaceuticals,  their toxicity is also an 
important characteristic. Two types of toxicity have to be disti nguished: i) short term effect 
and/or exposure which is called acute toxicity and ii) long time effect and/or exposure, named 
as chronic toxicity. For persistent organic compounds (including the pharmaceuti cal), the 
chronic toxicity is more suitab le, that is why European guidelines (EMEA 2006) recommend 
to use this term for the pharmaceuticals . However as the chronic toxicity data are often not 
available for pharmaceutical compounds (Crane et al. 2006) , acute tox icity data are in general 
used instead.  
To measure those different toxicities several parameters are  often used; the mo st important ones 
are LC 50, EC 50, NOEC and LOEC, defined in Table 1 .  
   22 Table 1:  Definition of the different toxicities 
Abbrev.  Complete name  Definition  
LC 50 Half Lethal Concentration  The concentration of a pollutant of the surrounding medium 
that will kill half of the sample population of a specific test 
species in a specified period of exposure  
EC 50 Half Efficient Concentration  The concentration of a drug at which 50% of its maximum 
response is observed  
NOEC  No Observed Effect Concentration  The highest concentration in which no effect is observed  
LOEC  Low Observed Effect 
Concentration  The lowest concentration for which an effect is observed  
 
Finally, another parameter called PNEC (Predicted No Effect C oncentration) was introduced 
by the European guidelines  (EMEA 2006). This value can be calculated based on the previous 
parameters described above (e.g. EC50. NOEC, ...). PNEC is obt ained by dividing the given 
parameter by a safety factor (AF).  
Among different class of pharmaceuticals defined above, the antibioti cs seem to be the more 
toxic with PNEC < 1 µg L-1, the more toxic being ciprofloxacin with a PNEC equal to 0.02 µg 
L-1 followed by ofloxacin, clarithromycin and erythromycin with 0.04 µg L-1 (Kümmerer 2003) . 
The second more dangerous category of pharmaceuticals is the anti-infla mmatories and 
analgesics with especially two compounds having a PNEC below 1 µg L-1: ibuprofen (0.01 µg 
L-1) and diclofenac (0.05 µg L-1) (Mendoza et al. 2015). Among the β-blockers and the diuretics 
only one compound has been found as really hazardous: propranolol with a PNE C of 0.05 µg 
L-1 (Huggett et al. 2002) .  
PNEC is a good way to approximate the toxicity but it would be necess ary to gather all 
information approved and to perform some others to have a unique PNEC based on chronic  23 toxicity for a larger number of species. Another point of limitation  of this method is that it does 
not consider the potential effect of the presence of a cocktail of  pharmaceuticals which was 
shown to have a different toxicity than that predicted by the PNEC val ues of the different 
pharmaceuticals taken separately. The synergetic effect can be whether antagonist or additive 
(Frédéric and Yves 2014). Tough a few studies were done on the additive effect, this 
phenomenon has been illustrated by Cleuvers (2005) and Brian et al. (2005) . It is assumed that 
when different pharmaceuticals have the same action mode, their conc entration can be 
considered as added in evaluating the toxicity of the solution (Escher  et al. 2005; Fraysse and 
Garric 2005) . In contrast, a study reported by Kümmerer (2009a) revealed that in presence of 
5-fluorouracil, the thresholds effect of cephalosporine could be decreas ed significantly. As a 
consequence, to evaluate the real toxicity of effluents, the mixtur e toxicity must be used.  
Even if the methods used for the evaluation of the toxicity of pharmace uticals are still not very 
accurate, it clearly appears that these compounds represent a thr eat to the environment as most 
of them can be considered as persistent hazardous organic compounds.  
 
Pharmaceuticals are among persistent organic pollutants:  
The persistence of a pharmaceutical is its capacity to resist  to physical, chemical and biological 
degradation processes and therefore to maintain a detectable concentr ation in water. As a 
consequence, persistent pollutants are not eliminated by a conventional WW TP or by natural 
elimination in the environment. The elimination processes occurring i n a conventional WWTP 
are well -described by Margot et al. (2015). Pharmaceuticals can be eliminat ed from wastewater 
during the sewage treatment whether by being transfer red to another phase or by being 
degraded. In the first case pharmaceuticals are sorbed onto sludge  or onto particular compounds 
thanks to hydrophobic or electrostatic interactions or evaporated. Kümmer er underlines the fact  24 that very little has been done about the sorption of antibiotics and this ne eds to be studied as it 
is an important parameter (Kümmerer 2009b). For example, ciprofl oxacin was found to sorb 
well onto activated sludge or sediments (Golet et al. 2002) . Some p harmaceuticals can also be 
degraded, in the better case, reaching total mineralization of the mother molecule. This process 
can occur by biological transformation or by abiotic degradation which involves reactions such 
as photolysis or hydrolysis. Elimination can also happen during wastewater transportation, in 
this situation the process more likely to occur is photodegradation. Thi s is well-explained in a 
relevant review article written by Khetan and Collins (2007). Thus,  the percentage of removal 
is hardly ever equal to the degradation rate as some of the pollutants can adsorb themselves on 
the bacteria. This parameter is indirectly often evaluated tha nks to the log(Kow), the octanol-
water partition coefficient (Table 2) .  
Some pharmaceuticals, such as metoprolol, diclofenac and tramadol are hardly removed by 
sewage treatment plants with removal efficiency less than 40%. Other molecules such as 
atenolol, ketoprofen and trimethoprim are moderately removed (40-70%) wher eas others 
(acetaminophen, naproxen, salicylic acid, etc .) are more efficiently removed (>70%) (Table 2). 
Therefore, according to this criterion: all the β-blockers and diuretics are of big concerns as 
well as diclofenac, mefenamic a cid, naproxen, ketoprofen and tramadol (anti-inflammatories 
and analgesics) and azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin , m etronidazole, 
sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (antibiotics). 
  30 Treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater: an issue to be addr essed 
To improve the removal rate in WWTPs , chlorination and UV irradiation are sometimes used 
after the biological treatment but the oxidizing power of both methods is  not strong enough to 
degrade most of the pharmaceuticals, their metabolites or degrada tion products (Khetan and 
Collins 2007). Other physical and physicochemical methods such as coagulation -flocculation, 
activated carbon adsorption and membrane filtration can be used to remove  pharmaceuticals 
from water (Luo et al. 2014). However, these treatments are se parative methods, the pollutants 
are not destroyed but separated and transfer red to another phase or produce concentrates that 
need to be further treated by other methods. In order to effectively degr ade them, strong and 
non-selective oxidants are thus necessary.  
Alternatively the so-called advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been developed to 
destroy efficiently toxic and/or persistent organic pollutants (Pignat ello et al. 2006; Oturan and 
Aaron 2014). Most of the AOPs are aqueous phase oxidation processes based on the generation 
of highly strong oxidant like hydroxyl radicals, the second strongest oxida nt after fluorine, 
which can destroy nearly any type of organic contaminants thanks to it s very high oxidation 
power (E° = 2.8 V/SHE) (Brillas et al. 2009; Sirés and Brilla s 2012; Oturan and Aaron 2014) . 
Among different AOPs, electrochemical advanced oxidation processes ( EAOPs) are of 
particular interest as they were shown to have a high removal eff iciency and the capability to 
reach complete mineralization of the treated solution s (Rodrigo et al. 2014a; Sirés et al. 2014; 
Vasudevan and Oturan 2014) . These processes are environmentally friendly and generate a 
great amount of hydroxyl radicals under specific operating conditions (Otura n et al. 2008a) . 
The electro-Fenton (EF) process is one of the most popular EAOPs coupl ing the chemical 
Fenton’s process to electrochemistry. It has been used successfull y in the treatment of a lot of 
pharmaceutical active ingredients and real wastewaters (Isarain -Chávez et al. 2011a; Barros et 
al. 2014a; Feng et al. 2014; Panizza et al. 2014; Yahya et al. 2014; Ga rcía-Montoya et al. 2015) .  31 However EAOPs become generally expensive when the objective is the quasi-complete 
mineralization of treated solutions because this operation needs long electrolysis time leading 
to a significant amount of electrical energy consumption (Muñoz et al.  2005; Faouzi et al. 2006; 
Oturan et al. 2013). To reduce the operating cost and to make a cost- effective process, the 
combination of an EAOP with a biological treatment can be an appropriat e solution to reduce 
the electrolysis time and to achieve the mineralization by a biological treatment (Scott and Ollis 
1995; Olvera- Vargas et al. 2016a). 
In this context, four pharmaceuticals belonging to different drug fam ilies (hydrochlorothiazide , 
ofloxacin , nadolol and tramadol) were selected to study their degradation and minera lization at 
lab scale by the EF process. The drug family and chemical struct ure of these molecules are 
provided in Table 3. They were chosen based on the following criteri a: i) their occurrence in 
surface, hospital and industrial wastewaters, ii) their resis tance to conventional treatment by 
WWTPs and iii) their toxicity. The objective was to find the bes t operating parameters to 
efficiently eliminate them and to study their degradation pathway. T hen a pilot was built to 
scale -up the process from 230 mL to 1.7 L. The hydrodynamic and the efficiency of  this reactor 
were studied. Finally, in the objective of decreasing the operating c osts, a combination between 
the electrochemical process and a biological treatment was perfor med.  
   34 mixing and a good aeration. A design of experiment was also carried out on thi s pilot for the 
first time based on the liquid flow rate, the current density and the iron concentration and could 
evidence the main parameters for the mineralization efficienc y and the energetic cost. An 
hydrodynamic study was performed as well as attempting to create a model to predict the 
percentage of mineralization in several locations of the reactor  in the continuous mode. Those 
findings enable to give hints for further constructions of large scale  reactors depending on the 
objective of the mineralization treatment . Finally, the combined bio- electro -Fenton process was 
also innovating as dealing with an already unworked molecule, the hydroc hlorothiazide, and 
estimating the amount of energy that could be saved. It also highlights the specific conditions 
that should be applied in the electrochemical treatment to reac h a good mineralization rate by 
explaining the role of the carboxylic acids, the aromatic intermedi ates and the pollutant in the 
biodegradation. A simple model is also presented to predict the inhibit ing effects of the aromatic 
intermediates on the carboxylic acid biodegradation.

2. Electrochemical advanced oxidation processes  
 
2.1 Mechanisms involved in EAOPs  
The most popular and commonly used electrochemical advanced oxidation proces ses (EAOPs ) 
are anodic oxidation (AO), also called (electro-oxidation) and el ectro-Fenton (EF) processes. 
These processes are based on direct (AO) or indirect (EF) cat alytic generation of hydroxyl 
radical (•OH) in the solution to be treated. Once generated in situ, these strong oxidizing agents 
will react on organic contaminants to oxidize them until their total  or partial mineralization 
(Eqs. (1) and (2 )).  
Pollutants + •OH à intermediates         (1) 
Intermediates + •OH à à à CO 2 + H 2O + inorganic ions     (2) 
These types of processes have been well-described by several review  papers (Brillas et al. 2009; 
Barrera -Dias et al. 2014; Oturan and Aaron 2014; Sirés et al. 2014; Pliego e t al. 2015) .  
 
2.1.1 Direct oxidation (AO)  
In this process the oxidation takes place at the surface of the anode. Heterogeneous hydroxyl 
radicals M(•OH)) are formed  at the anode surface from the oxidation of water according to the 
following reaction (Eq. ( 3)) (Marselli et al. 2003) .   42 M + H 2O ® M(•OH) + H+ + e–          (3) 
where M represents the anode material and M(•OH) is the hydroxyl radical adsorbed on the 
anode (M) surface. 
For this kind of oxidation, two different types of transfer can limi t the process: mass transfer or 
charge transfer. Mass transfer is done by migration (driven by the el ectrical field), by diffusion 
(driven by chemical potential gradient) and/or by convection processes . It can be expressed 
with the Nernst-Planck equation. As it is experimentally difficul t to distinguish these three 
processes, the mass transfer process is generally approached in a semi- empirical way under 
specific conditions . These conditions are, i) the solution is conductive enough (use of a 
supporting electrolyte), ii) the solution is well-mixed and iii) the applied potential (or current) 
is high enough to oxidize efficiently the substra te.  
Two different behaviors can occur depending on the anode material (Brillas et al. 2009). Active 
anodes promote the formation of higher states oxides or superoxides (MO ) (Eq. (6 )) (Simond 
et al. 1997). 
M(•OH) ® MO + H+ + e–            (6 )  
This type of anodes form chemisorbed radicals which limit the reac tion at the surface of the 
anode as there is a strong interaction between the radicals and the  anode surface. The most 
common anodes of this type are Pt and mixed metal or DSA (dimensional ly stable anode) 
anodes .  
On the opposite, the non-active anodes enable the formation of physisorbed radicals with a 
quite weak interaction between hydroxyl radical (•OH) and the anode surface (M) (Eq. (2 )). 
Hydroxyl radicals thus formed are able to react in the diffusion la yer and can conduct to 
complete mineralization of organics. The most representative non- active anodes are BDD, tin 
or lead oxides and sub-stoichiometric titanium oxides.   43 AO process can also imply indirect (or mediated) oxidation occurri ng in the bulk of the solution 
thanks to the formation, at the electrode surface, of a mediator  (an oxidizing species). Once 
migrated to the bulk solution, these oxidizing agents can participat e in the oxidation of organic 
pollutants. Usually it concerns active chlorine species and peroxy anions. For instance, the 
relatively strong oxidants such as hypochlorous acid/hypochlorite anion (formed in chloride 
medium), peroxydisulfate anion (formed from sulfate medium) and peroxyphos phate anion 
(formed in phosphate medium) can be created (Barrera -Dias et al. 2014) at the anode surface 
and contribute to the oxidation process in the bulk solution.  
2.1.2 Indirect electro-oxidation: Electro -Fenton (EF) process 
EF process is an indirect EAOP since hydroxyl radicals are not ge nerated directly from charge 
transfer at the electrode level but in the solution from the well -known Fenton’s reaction  (Eq. 
(8)) (Fenton 1894; Haber and Weiss 1934). In the Fenton’s process, homogeneous hydroxyl 
radicals (•OH) are generated from Fenton's reagent, a mixture of H 2O2 and Fe2+, added 
externally to the solution to be treated. In contrast, for the EF  process, the Fenton's reagent is 
electrochemically produced at the cathode. H 2O2 is formed by a 2-electron reduction of 
dissolved O 2 (Eq. (9)) and Fe2+ by a single electron reduction of ferric cation (Eq. (10)). A t the 
anode, water is oxidized to O 2 (Eq. (1 1)) and, depending on the anode material, adsorbed 
hydroxyl radicals can be formed (Eq. (3 )).  
Fe2+ + H 2O2 ® Fe3+ + OH + OH–         (8 )  
O2 + 2 H+ + 2 e– ® H2O2            (9) 
Fe3+ + e– ® Fe2+             (10) 
2 H 2O ® O2 + 4 H+ + 4 e–            (11) 
The Fenton’s process was a major step forward as it is easy to implement and uses rela tively  44 inexpensive and harmless chemicals (Bautista et al. 2008; Oturan and Aaron 2014) . It was first 
applied in 1960 for the treatment of organic pollutants (Brown et al . 1964), since then a large 
application to the treatment of effluents was reported, such as the discoloring effluents of dye 
industries (Kuo 1992) or the treatment of different kind of wastewater s (Gogate and Pandit 
2004) .  
Despite its interesting use in the treatment of effluents cont aminated by organic pollutant, this 
process suffers from some drawbacks such as needing high amounts of Fenton's  reagent to 
generate enough quantity of OH. The introduction of a high amount of H 2O2 and Fe2+ implies 
economic aspect and also the formation of ferric hydroxide sludge needing a  supplementary 
processing. Moreover this situation favors the rate of wasting react ions (Eq. (12) and (13 )) 
resulting in low efficiency. 
OH + H 2O2 ® H2O+ HO 2          (12) 
OH + Fe2+ ® Fe3+ + OH–         (13) 
The EF process, developed and popularized by Oturan's and Brillas' group at t he beginning of  
the 21st century has been designed to avoid the disadvantages of the classical Fe nton’s process 
by coupling between electrochemistry and Fenton’s chemistry (Bril las et al. 2000; Oturan 
2000). Electrochemistry offers an amazing help in this respect (Va sudevan and Oturan 2014) . 
Indeed, in contrast to the  classical Fenton’s process, in the EF process the Fenton's reagent is 
in situ generated (H 2O2) or regenerated (Fe2+): H 2O2 is generated on a suitable cathode by a 2-
electron reduction of dissolved O 2 (Eq. ( 9)) and regeneration of Fe2+ from Fe3+ formed in Fenton 
reaction (Eq. (10)). The electrocatalytic regeneration of ferr ous iron allows the use of a catalytic 
amount of this ion as catalyst thus avoiding the ferric hydroxide sludge  formation an d also 
preventing the wasting of generated OH (Eq. (1 3)) (Brillas et al. 2009; Oturan and Aaron 
2014). Therefore, the use of EF process instead of Fenton’s proces s allows the following  45 advantages: (i) minimizing reagent cost by in situ generation of F enton's reagent, (ii) avoiding 
risks related to transportation and storage of H 2O2, (iii) avoiding (or minimizing) reactions 
wasting OH (Eqs. (12) and (13)) because H 2O2 and Fe2+ concentrations are quite low since 
they are consumed as soon as they are formed, (iv) eliminating sl udge formation and (v) 
generally providing high removal rate of organics due to the electrochemica l regeneration of 
Fe2+ which catalyzes  Fenton’s reaction (Zhu et al. 2011; Rodrigo et al.  2014a; Sirés et al. 2014; 
Oturan and Oturan 2018) .  
The use of an appropriate cathode material is essential in the EF  process; it should be able to 
generate efficiently H 2O2 and have a low catalytic activity for its reduction. Moreover t he 
cathode must have high overpotential for H 2 evolution since the process is optimal at acid 
medium (Oturan and Oturan 2018). These characteristics are gener ally satisfied by 
carbonaceous materials that are often used in EF process such as t hree-dimensional carbon 
materials (carbon felt, graphite felt, carbon sponge, activate d carbon fiber) (Oturan et al. 2000; 
Wang et al. 2005; Özcan et al. 2008; Oturan et al. 2010; Panizza and Oturan 2011) and carbon-
PTFE -O2 gas diffusion cathode (Brillas et al. 1995). Other carbonaceous mat erials like graphite, 
reticulated vitreous carbon and carbon nanotubes have also been tested. M ore recently BDD 
and Ni foam have been also shown to be able to produce H 2O2 (Oturan et al. 2010; Panizza and 
Oturan 2011; Saussereau et al. 2013; Bocos et al. 2016a). 
On the other hand, the nature of the anode is also very important in EF  process. In the case of 
the use of a non-active anode, M(•OH) are produced on the anode surface (Panizza and Cerisola 
2001). In this case EF process also includes AO process since homogene ous (•OH) and 
heterogeneous M(•OH) are produced simultaneously in the bulk solution and on the anode 
surface, respectively, thus enhancing strongly the oxidation power of the  process (Oturan et al. 
2012). The best non-active anode material known is the BDD. However, it s high cost can 
constitute an obstacle to its scale up for large-scale applicati ons. Therefore, research is done on  46 the use of ceramic electrodes based on sub-stoichiometric titani um oxides (Ti nO2n-1) (Smith and 
Walsh 1998; Chaplin 2014). Recent studies have shown that this new anode mate rial is able to 
provide results close to that of BDD in AO and EF processes (Ga niyu et al. 2017; Oturan et al. 
2017). 
During the EF treatment, numerous reactions are involved and the mass transfer constitutes an 
important parameter in the degradation of pollutant as some reactants  have to reach the surface 
of the electrode (O 2, Fe3+) when others have to reach the bulk from the electrode surface ( H2O2, 
Fe2+). For instance, the oxygen required for the formation of H 2O2 (Eq. (9)) has to be transferred 
from the gas phase to the aqueous phase and then needs to be adsorbed onto the e lectrode 
surface before its reduction process (Brillas et al. 2009). The r equired dissolved oxygen 
concentration is reached usually by aeration. If oxygen is not provided at  an adequate rate, it 
becomes a limiting factor, controlling H 2O2 generation rate and consequently the EF process. 
As the diffusivity of oxygen in the gas phase is significantly higher tha n in the liquid phase, it 
is considered that the gas phase offers no transfer resistance. T hus, it can be suggested that the 
overall oxygen transfer rate (OTR) is controlled by the liquid phase,  expressed as follows (Eq. 
(14)): 
OTR = k La (C*bulk, O2  - C bulk,O2 )           (14) 
where OTR is the oxygen mass transfer rate (mol m-3 s-1), kLa is defined as the volumetric 
oxygen mass transfer coefficient (s-1), C*bulk, O2  and C bulk,O2  are the equilibrium concentration 
and the oxygen concentration in the bulk (mol m-3), respectively.  
It is worthy to note that the oxygen mass transfer has been well st udied for water and wastewater 
treatment systems but not in EF process. The value of k La depends mainly on the configuration 
of the reactors, on the air flow rate, on the airflow diffuse r which will influence the bubbles 
size and on the hydrodynamics in the reactors.   47 The transfer from the bulk to the anode (pollutants) and the transfer  from the cathode to the 
bulk (H 2O2 and Fe2+) are key points for the efficiency of the process. That is why, unde rstanding 
the controlling parameter is important. As it was explained previ ously for the AO (Eqs. (4 ) – 
(6)), the expression of the current density in EF follows the same  behavior. But, the system is 
more complex as for the EF, the oxidation of pollutants can occur on t he anode surface (AO) 
and in the bulk (involving both homogenously generated •OH from Fenton reaction and 
mediated oxidation from oxidants formed at the anode).  
There are several operating parameters involved in EF process e fficiency which have now long 
been studied (Brillas et al. 2009; Nidheesh and Gandhimathi 2012; Oturan a nd Aaron 2014; 
Martínez-Huitle et al. 2015). The principal parameters are: sol ution pH, applied current, catalyst 
nature and concentration, supporting electrolyte (nature and concentrati on), electrode gap, 
oxygen (or air) supply rate and temperature.  
The pH is a very important parameter of this process, it is us ually recommended to work at a 
pH around 3 (Boye et al. 2002). The acidic medium is required for the f ormation of H 2O2 (Eq. 
(9)), however pH values lower than 2 lead to the transformation of  H2O2 to peroxonium (H 2O3+) 
ion which is less reactive toward Fe2+ in the formation of •OH via Fenton reaction and at higher 
pH this compound decomposes into water and oxygen (Wang and Lemley 2001; Feng et al. 
2003; Wang et al. 2010b). Moreover, at pH above 4, Fe3+ precipitates as Fe(OH) 3 and at pH 
below 1, Fe2+ forms complexes with H 2O2 (Pignatello 1992). 
The current is another key factor in EF process since the rate of electrochemical reactions is 
promoting the generation of •OH (Eqs. (9 ), (10) and consequently Eq. (8)) and M(OH) (Eq. 
(3)). Therefore this parameter influences significantly the oxida tion and/or mineralization 
efficiency of the process (Narayanan and Rajendran 2003; Oturan and Aar on 2014). But a too 
high current promotes competitive reactions consuming electrical ener gy in side reactions  48 (reduction of water to H 2 or its oxidation to O 2) or wasting of •OH/M(•OH) (recombination or 
oxidation reactions) in the electrolytic cell (Zhang et al. 2007; Br illas et al. 2009; Sirés et al. 
2014). The current value determines also the type of limitation for the system whether by the 
mass transfer or by the charge transfer as explained previously. U sually this parameter is 
experimentally determined for each compound/equipment before treatment.   
Another highly important parameter is the nature or concentration of the catalyst. Among 
different catalysts tested for EF process, it was evidenced tha t iron (Fe2+/Fe3+) is one of the best 
since it is not harmful, has low cost and requires low concentra tion (Brillas et al. 2009) . With 
regard to the Fe2+ concentration, the optimal value depends on the cathode used; optimal value s 
about 0.1 – 0.2 mM for carbon-felt cathode and 0.5 mM for gas diffusi on cathode were reported 
many times in literature (Brillas et al. 2009; Oturan and Aaron 2014;  Sirés et al. 2014). High 
Fe2+ concentration is generally avoided since it promotes the wasting reaction given in Eq. (13 ) 
(Panizza and Cerisola 2001; Oturan and Aaron 2014). This factor is a lso usually experimentally 
adjusted. Meanwhile the Cu2+/Cu+ couple was also investigated as catalyst in the EF process 
and contradictory results have been published. For instance a recent study, demonstrated that 
copper could be more efficient and more cost-effective than iron with a higher TOC removal 
rate (Santana-martínez et al. 2016). But, other researchers highlighted that iron catalyst provides 
a better mineralization efficiency than cupper ions (Oturan and Otu ran 2005) .  
Airflow and air diffuser are also important parameters that influence significantly both oxygen 
transfer and hydrodynamic conditions in the reactors. In the case of l ow oxygen flow rate the 
solution cannot be saturated in O 2 and oxygen transfer can become the limiting step affecting 
the efficiency of H 2O2 production rate and accordingly •OH generation rate through Fenton’s 
reaction. 
In addition, temperature is an influent parameter that impacts all the process. It affects the 
kinetics of chemical and electrochemical reactions and mass t ransfer parameters (diffusion  49 coefficient, etc.). In general, temperatures ranging between 20 a nd 30 °C are applied in the 
literature (Umar et al. 2010) since higher temperatures decrea se O 2 solubility as well as promote 
H2O2 decomposition. For the nature of the electrolyte, good conductivity ions  must be used. 
Indeed, Ghoneim et al. (Ghoneim et al. 2011) performed an experiment c omparing the 
efficiency of the EF with three different electrolytes: Na 2SO 4, NaCl and KCl. The better 
efficiency of Na 2SO 4 have been explained by the higher conductivity of SO 42- compared to Cl- 
(Gil et al. 2006). They also obtained a higher degradation rate using KCl t han NaCl explained 
again with the greater conductivity of K+ compared to Na+. On the other hand, the degradation 
of methyl parathion by EF with sodium sulfate was slower than wi th NaClO 4 or NaNO 3 because 
of the formation of sulfato-complexes with iron (De Laat et al . 2004; Diagne et al. 2007). The 
electrolyte allows to increase the solution conductivity by avoiding an  ohmic potential drop, 
responsible for a higher energetical consumption. Meanwhile it was dem onstrated that a too 
high concentration of Na2SO 4 can produce a great decrease in the TOC abatement which can 
be due to the side reaction of hydroxyl radicals with sulfate ions (Z hou et al. 2007; Gökku ş 
2016) .  
 
2.2 Reactor configuration  
Recent ways of enhancing efficiency and decreasing the costs in EA OPs consist in choosing a 
specific reactor configuration to enhance mass transfer and current  efficiency. The reactor 
configuration is a key point for the efficiency of the pollutant degrada tion by electro-Fenton. 
Some review papers have given an overview of the different cell configur ations used until 2012 
(Brillas et al. 2009; Nidheesh and Gandhimathi 2012). Most of the studie s have been performed 
at lab -scale with undivided cell reactors with volumes lower than 300 mL.  Another system, 
quite similar to the previous one (undivided cell), is the use of divided cells with two or three 
electrodes. The undivided system has the advantage of lower operating costs due to the possible  50 use of a lower cell voltage in comparison with the divided cells.  Moreover the latter has the 
advantage of avoiding H 2O2 to reach the anode and to be oxidized there (Eq. (15)) thus 
preventing the following side reaction (Brillas et al. 2009) .  
H2O2 ® HO 2• + H+ + e–          (15) 
Two other systems used to a lesser extent were the filter pr ess reactors operating in batch and 
recirculation mode (Prabhakaran et al. 2009) and the bubble reactor operat ing in continuous 
mode (Rosales et al. 2009). However, in the last 5 years, new r eactor configurations or enhanced 
configurations of formerly used reactors were developed that allows ha ving a greater efficiency 
and/or lower costs (Martínez-Huitle et al. 2015). Therefore, the aim of this section is to give an 
overview of those new studies which are sum-up in Table 4. Some of the se configurations are 
also illustrated in Fig. 1. The novelties include: i) the way of m ixing in order to favor mass

solution, iii) the shape and distance between electrodes and their num ber, iv) the shape and the 
volume of the cell and v) the type of out streaming.  
 
2.2.1 Geometric  parameters 
Recent research has most specifically focused on geometric changes  in electrodes. Among 
them, Su et al. (Su et al. 2013) studied the impact of using plate or rod electrodes for aniline 
removal (Fig. 1). The experimental conditions are described in Tabl e 4. They found out that the 
plate electrodes have a better aniline degradation rate than the rod electrodes for add ed [H2O2] 
> 29 mM. This phenomenon is explained as the distance between the ele ctrodes is lower (1.5 
cm) for plate electrodes while it is significantly higher (5 .5 cm) for rod electrodes. This allows 
the plate electrode system to have a lower electrical resist ance and thus a better electrical 
efficiency. On the contrary, in the case of lower [H 2O2] added to the solution, the rod electrode 
cell is more efficient at degrading the pollutant (Su et al. 2013).  The area of the working  52 calculation. The parallel configuration of the electrodes in rea ctor 1 can explain the lower 
energy consumption. Indeed, this configuration reduces by two the current inte nsity which 
results in a lower voltage for the cell and thus in a lower energy consumption compared with 
reactor 2 where the current is not divided. The surfaces of the el ectrodes facing each other in 
reactor 3 are smaller causing a lower conductance and thus an increa se of the cell voltage.  
Another cell geometry has been proposed by Lei et al. (Lei et al. 2013): the trickle-bed reactor 
(Fig. 2) to enhance the efficiency of the electro-Fenton process. This system is made of several 
pieces which constitute the fixed part of the packed bed of the reac tor using the downward 
movement of a liquid and the upward movement of gas. Details about the r eactor configuration 
and the treatment conditions are given in Table 4. The air and the solut ion are both mixed before 
entering the cell. This configuration enables to dissolve the oxygen fi rst in the liquid allowing 
the easy transfer of oxygen to the electrode surface and therefore e nhancing the production of 
hydrogen peroxide. The authors found out that this system is as efficient  as GDE reactor but 
avoids electrolyte leakage and gas bubbles which makes its application f easible at a larger scale 
(Lei et al. 2013) .

Finally, Xu et al. (Xu et al. 2016) suggest ed the use of tubular membranes for both anode and 
 54 Fig. 3:  Scheme of the dual tubular membranes EF reactor. Repr inted with permission from ref. (Xu et al.

Another tubular system was recently created. It is based on two dri ving forces: i) the 
transmembrane pressure and ii) the current. The authors demonstrate d the efficiency of their 
system, described in Table 4 (tubular membrane A) by the higher H 2O2 production of their 
system by finding optimums current and transmembrane pressure (Olvera-va rgas et al. 2018). 
 
2.2.2 Out streaming 
As in the study on tubular membranes, research was done on the effe ct of the direction of the 
flow whether parallel to the electrodes (flow-by) or perpendicular t o them (flow-through or 
vertical-flow). Two recent studies analyzed the degradation of methyl ene blue and tartrazine, 
respectively, under those different flowing conditions. The single compa rtment system working 
on methylene blue is composed of perforated DSA (dimensionally stable anode ) electrode as 
the anode and a modified graphite felt as a cathode (Fig. 4) (Ma et  al. 2016). The second 
multiple cell reactor, used to degrade tartrazine, is equipped wit h PbO 2 anodes and modified 
graphite felt mesh cathodes (Ren et al. 2016). Results obtained showe d the superiority of the 
flow-through reactor over the flow-by reactor in the same conditions ( Table 4). This result can 
be explained by the enhancement of the mass transport in the vertical -flow compared to the 
parallel flow (Santos et al. 2010; Liu and Vecitis 2012).  The higher efficiency is related to the 
greater accumulation of H 2O2 in the flow-through (57.8 mg L-1) than in the flow-by system 
(51.9 mg L-1) (Ma et al. 2016) .   56 closer the electrodes, they could increase the COD abatement and de crease the energetical 
consumption. The specific energy consumption was of 50 and 30 kWh (kgCOD)-1 for 1 pair of 
electrode separated by 10 and 2 mm, respectively, after 6 h elec trolysis (Hu et al. 2018) .

2.2.3 Special way of supplying O 2 
Recently an interesting idea appeared in numerous publications: a specia l way of providing 
oxygen to the system without supplying an air or oxygen flow rate. This sys tem is based on the 
use of two parallel rotating cathodes with an anode in the middle (Fig. 6) (Yu et al. 2014) . The 
operating parameters related to this reactor are described in Ta ble 4. This system enables to 
bring oxygen without blowing air or O 2 in the solution making it more cost-effective and 
providing a good mass transfer between the solution and the electrode sur face as demonstrated 
by comparing with the same electrodes but without rotating cathodes and providing O 2 (Table 
4) (Yu et al. 2014). 
 57

permission from ref. (Yu et al. 2014) . Copyright 2018, American Chemical Society.  
 
Another two-compartment reactor avoiding the use of oxygen is based on the catalytic  
generation of H 2O2 (Eq. (16)) thanks to Pd/C particles. The design of this novel reactor  is based 
on the work reported by Liu et al. (Liu et al. 2007) reporting an elec trolytic system able to 
generate different pH environment without adding any chemicals by using wa ter electrolysis to 
create O 2 and H 2. A low pH was first used to produce H 2O2 and then a high pH was employed 
to neutralize the treated solution before its release to the na tural water stream (Liu et al. 2007) . 
The characteristics of the reactor are described in Table 4. T he first compartment enables the 
formation of H 2, O 2 and H+ by water electrolysis, of H 2O2 (Eq. (1 6)) by the catalytic reaction 
thanks to Pd/C and finally leading to hydroxyl radicals from the Fenton’s reaction.  
H2 + O 2 ® H2O2          (16) 
The second compartment accumulates OH- which is utilized to neutralize the solution when 
needed. The main advantage of this system is to avoid chemicals to s et the solution pH and to 
obtain a neutral solution after treatment that can be directed dire ctly to a bioreactor. To illustrate 
the efficiency of their reactor, the authors compared the producti on of H 2O2 and its 
accumulation to some values reported in the literature and concluded t hat it could produce more 
H2O2 than carbon fiber or carbon nanotubes cathodes but less than a GDE c athode. This reactor 
 58 presents some drawbacks such as a high voltage required due to the elec trical resistance of the 
salt bridge and the high price of the catalyst; however it was shown to be reusable (Yuan et al. 
2011). In order to overcome such drawbacks another system was created by Z hang et al. Their 
system produced O 2 and an acidic medium thanks to the use of a second anode where water  is 
oxidized in O 2 and H+. This system is promising by avoiding the use of O 2 and expensive 
material such as Pd (Zhang et al. 2017) .  
One of the latest study on a new way of providing O 2 was proposed by Perez et al ., (Pérez et al. 
2016) which consisted of a combination of a flow-through system and a Ventur i-based jet 
aerator (Fig. 7) which allows an efficient production of H 2O2 and a very good oxygen supply 
with low energy costs. This system is based on the Venturi effec t as in the thinner part of the 
tube a depression is created which sucks the air into the system le ading to a higher liquid 
velocity which enables to break the oxygen gas bubbles and thus helps their di ssolution in 
water. This system is compared to a similar reactor using G DE cathode and a flow-by cell 
system. The reactor with Venture-based jet aerator can produce 960 m g H 2O2 L-1 whereas the 
reactor with GDE cathode produces 700 mg H 2O2 L-1 (Table 4). It is also showed that the 
efficiency of such aeration is higher than the same reactor without  oxygen supply or with air 
sparging to the jet aerator. The concentration of H 2O2 obtained at a current density of 75 mA 
cm-3 after 30 min, is very low for no oxygen supply and, 8 and 400 mgH 2O2 L-1 for air sparging 
and jet aerator, respectively (Pérez et al. 2016).  59

2.2.4 Micro- fluidic  
A different type of reactor was recently used for electro-Fent on processes: microfluidic reactors 
(Scialdone et al. 2013; Scialdone et al. 2014; Sabatino et al. 2016). I t was first used by Scialdone 
et al. (2013) who studied the capacities of this type of reactor compared to a conventional 
undivided macro reactor. The two different reactors are described in Table 4. The micro-reactor 
had the following advantages: i) no use of electrolyte as there is  a very small transfer resistance 
due to the very small interelectrode gap ii) no need of gaseous stream  as oxygen is provided by 
water oxidation at the anode. The use of a graphite cathode provides a  cheap and easy to handle 
system. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) is used as comparison param eter. As can be seen 
in Table 4, the abatement is more than two times higher for the microfluidic reactor compared 
to the macro reactor. The better efficiency of the micro reac tor is explained by a comparison of 
H2O2 production which is 0.6 mM and 6 mM for the macro and microreactor , respectively. 
Besides, the calculated current efficiency (CE) values also highl ight better performance of the 
 60 microreactor (8% for the macro-reactor against f 33% for the micro-reactor at 10 A m-2). This 
fact can be explained by high solubility of O 2 in micro conditions: it is formed by water 
oxidation at the anode and dissolved close to its maximum solubility. As  the system is small, 
the O 2 is present at a high concentration at the cathode (both electrodes  being close to each 
other) and leads to the formation of a higher concentration of H 2O2 (Scialdone et al. 2013) . 
However, the very small size of the channels could be problematic s ince they can be plugged 
when real effluents with organic and mineral particles are tre ated. The group of Scialdone 
investigated also the performances of the different advanced oxidation p rocesses for a 
microfluidic treatment and concluded that combining EF and electro-oxidati on could 
significantly be enhanced by microfluidic (Scialdone et al. 2014). The  last study on microfluidic 
system applied to EF dealt with the use of micro-reactor cells  in series. The authors concluded 
that using three EF reactors in series was not useful compared to the use of one micro-reactor 
as the energy consumption value increases much more than the TOC aba tement rate for the 
reactors in series (Sabatino et al. 2016) .  
2.2.5 Electrical energy consumption (EC)  
In order to compare the cost effectiveness of different systems , their energetical treatment costs 
were estimated. For instance, the EC were of 0.5 and 20 kWh (gTO C)-1 for the system with 
rotating cathodes (Yu et al. 2014) and for the system with the two cat hodes in the center (Yu et 
al. 2015), respectively. This can suggest that the rotating cathode is a more cost-effective 
system. Meanwhile this treatment is done in batch so to well-e valuate the real cost of the 
treatment, experiments in continuous mode are required. In the case  of flow-through reactors 
(Ma et al. 2016; Ren et al. 2016), the EC could be evaluated using a modified formula (Eq. 
(17)) in order to take into account the continuous mode.  
EC = !	×	$
(&'()	*	&'(+)	×-	            (17)  61 with E, the cell voltage in Volt, I the current in Ampere, TOC 0, the initial TOC, TOC(t), the 
TOC at the steady state, D the flow rate in L h-1.  
Using this equation , it was found that the flow-through multiple system (Ren et al. 2016) i s 
consuming 140 kWh (g TOC)-1 whereas the flow-through single system (Ma et al. 2016) is 
consuming 4 k Wh (g TOC)-1 so 35 times less. Meanwhile an important point h as to be 
underlined, the amount of treated pollutant was of 20 mg per h for the single system against 
240 mg per h for the pilot (multiple system). So the gap is reduced by taking this point into 
account. Nevertheless the consumption is higher in the pilot which can be explained by the 
scale up of the treatment as the single system is done in 150 mL. H owever, it is at this step 
impossible to compare experiments done on the different reactor configu rations (different 
pollutants, different initial TOC configuration, different flow mode , etc.). Much more 
researches are needed on this aspect and the EC should be estimated for  each configuration 
under comparable conditions and considered as a key parameter.

  65 2.2.6 Hints for scale- up 
The different parameters stated in this section are also ver y important in order to scale-up the 
process to treat real effluent at an industrial scale. The a lready published research and review 
articles gave some hints to scale-up the process concerning i) the  size and organization of the 
electrodes, ii) the temperature, iii) the mixing, iv) the out streaming and v) the continuous mode. 
In order to treat larger volumes, the system must be larger. Re garding the electrodes, two 
options are possible; either using high surface electrodes or using a stack system. The use of 
bigger electrodes produces a non-uniform repartition of the current on t he electrode surface 
which reduces the yield. By using stacking electrodes, the cost is hi gher so a compromise has 
to be reached. When stacking is used the electrode configuration is a lso important, the 
configuration will be either in monopolar or bipolar. In monopolar connecti on, all anodes and 
cathodes are directly connected to the power supply which provides a low er operating cost 
because of lower cell potential. In bipolar connection, only both border e lectrodes are connected 
to the current supplier which results in a higher cell voltage but this configuration provides a 
better depletion of organic pollutant s (Martínez-Huitle et al. 2015) . The parameter mixing is 
directly related to the mass transport and mass transfer phenome na. It can become a real 
problem during the scale-up and can decrease significantly the efficie ncy of the process. 
Martínez-Huitle et al. (2015) highlighted this fact, identifying a real lack of mass transport in 
big-sized mixed tank reactor compared to flow reactor. For example , dos Santos et al. (dos 
Santos et al. 2014) compared COD removal at a mixed cell and at  a flow-pass cell, at 25 °C, 
with a current of 15 mA cm-2 and 20 mA cm-2 obtaining 50.3% and 76.2% of COD removal 
with a BDD anode for the mixed cell and flow cell, respectively.  To improve the mass transport 
of mixed tank reactors, a recirculation can be added; this will not  only improve mass transport 
efficiency but will also drag gas bubbles which otherwise would accum ulate increasing the 
Ohmic resistance of the bulk and finally rising the energy consumption (Ma rtínez-Huitle et al.  66 2015). The type of flow is also a key point for the scaling-up as it i s directly related to the 
efficiency of the process, as seen before, the flow-through reactor provides better performance 
than the flow-by reactor. Radjenovic and Sedlak (2015) proposed the combination of  this type 
of reactor with three-dimensional electrodes in order to obtain  the better cell system for a large 
scale treatment. Computational fluid dynamics are recommended to opti mize the flow system, 
especially at the entrance and at the exit of the cell where t urbulences often happen. 
Nonetheless, only a few numbers of studies were reported on this tool (Frías -Ferrer et al. 2011; 
Cruz- Díaz et a l. 2012; Rivero et al. 2012; Vázquez et al. 2013) . Temperature belongs to the 
influent parameters in the reactor design, but it is often not studi ed as at bench scale there is no 
need to cool the system. However, at large scale applications, thi s parameter has to be taken 
into account and a cooling system can be involved. 
For industrial applications level, the continuous mode has to be reache d to enable the treatment 
of large amounts of wastewater. The stability of the electrodes  is to be considered as this can 
directly pollute the solution or can decrease the efficiency of  the process. Some studies 
evaluated the steady efficiency through several cycles (Rosales et  al. 2012b; Bocos et al. 2016c; 
Plakas et al. 2016) or by inspecting the electrode surface thanks to S canning Electron 
Microscopy (SEM) after the treatment (Iglesias et al. 2013). Most of the works describing a 
continuous electro-Fenton process are given in Table 5. Most of the e xperiments summarized 
in this table are carried out in heterogeneous system which avoids the formation of sludge and 
requires of a filtration post-treatment to eliminate or recover the catalyst (Brillas et al. 2009) . 
Iron alginate gel beads are often used as solid catalysts aiming a t degrading for example 81% 
of Lissamine Green B (Iglesias et al. 2013), 90% of Imidaclopri d (Iglesias et al. 2014) and 99% 
of Azure B (Rosales et al. 2012b) (Table 5). The economic aspect of these reactors is often left 
aside, only a few studies considered it. With 20 A, 25.5 L of industrial effluent is degraded 
consuming 0.14 kWh (g TOC)-1 (Casado and Fornaguera 2008), with 5 V, 0.15 L of Lissamine  67 Green B is partly mineralized (COD removal of 86%) costing 15.75  kWh (kg dye)-1 (Bocos et 
al. 2016c), with 3.5 V, 3 L of Rhodamine B is treated reaching 98%  of dye degradation 
consuming 50 Wh (g dye)-1 (Nidheesh and Gandhimathi 2015) and with 0.14 A, 1 L of C.I. 
Acid red and blue are degraded using 0.024 kWh (g COD)-1 (Pajootan et al. 2014) (Table 5 ). 
However, only a few articles reported the continuous mode; more work has to be done and 
especially treatments with real wastewaters need to be studi ed. Industrial water from a chemical 
firm and a pulp and paper company (Casado and Fornaguera 2008), landfill lea chate (Zhang et 
al. 2012) and real wastewater from Mexico (Durán Moreno et al. 2004) are successfully 
degraded by EF in continuous mode. Thus the TOC removal is 80 and 60% for the effluents 
from chemical firm and the pulp and paper company, respectively, the  COD removal was 60% 
for the landfill and 92.3% discoloration is obtained for the waste water from Mexico (Table 5 ). 
In synthetic effluents, the concentration of pollutants is indeed hi gher than in real wastewaters, 
the interaction of different pollutants together and the effect of mi neral ions as well as the effect 
of natural substances such as humic acids are not yet evaluated.

3.1 EF applied to β-blockers  
Table 6 gives an overview of EF applied to β-blockers for the last few years. Only three β-
blockers have been studied, atenolol, metoprolol and propranolol. They are al ways degraded in 
synthetic aqueous solution, with only one study evaluating the synergetic eff ect of using a 
solution composed of several β-blockers (Sirés et al. 2010). The concentration of the pollutants 
ranges from 26 mg L-1 to 150 mg L-1. Most of these molecules require between 5 and 30 min to 
be completely oxidized but the mineralization of their solutions takes several hours of 
electrolysis. This difference of treatment time can be expla ined by involving several steps in 
the mineralization procedure while the oxidative degradation occurs in one  step. Another reason 
can be the formation of intermediates products more difficult to ox idize than the initial 
pollutant, in the latter case .  
The mineralization current efficiency ( MCE ) reported for these experiments is depending on 
the treatment time and is always less than 50%; it is partly due  to side reactions occurring during 
the process. A link between the chemical structure and the apparent  kinetic rate constant of 
degradation can be underlined thanks to Isarain -Chávez et al. (2011c) who performed the 
degradation of three beta-blockers under the same conditions. Atenolol has the higher 
degradation rate constant which is about 10 times greater than the val ue reported for metoprolol 
and propranolol. This difference can be explained by the chemical struc ture of atenolol 
containing an amide group which is more electrophilic than the groups conta ined in metoprolol 
and propranolol. One of the best pseudo first order kinetic constant is obtained for atenolol 
degradation with a value of 9.5 10-3 s-1 whereas the other constants are around 10-3 s-1 (Fig. 8). 
In spite of this high rate constant value, the electrical energy cons umption is significantly higher 
(1.08 kWh (g TOC)-1) than other b-blockers having a value of around 0.30 kWh (g TOC)-1. This  72 can be related to the formation of hardly oxidizable intermediates i n the former case. A 
compromise should then be reached between an efficient degradation and a cost-effective 
operating process. More studies taking into account the cost of the p rocess are required in order 
to better evaluate the feasibility of this process.

  76 3.2 EF applied to anti -inflammatories and analgesics  
Seven anti-inflammatories and analgesics are studied by the EF proc ess. Table 7 gives some 
details about these experiments and their treatment efficiency. The efficiency of the treatment 
measured by the TOC removal degree varies significantly as it was 57% in 8 h for salicylic acid 
with graphite plates as electrodes whereas it reached 95% in 1. 5 h for ketoprofen using BDD 
and carbon felt as anode and cathode, respectively. Concerning the pseudo fir st order kinetics, 
the apparent rate constant ( kapp) values range from 10-4 to 10-3 s-1 (Fig. 8). Finally, as for beta-
blockers, the best way to identify the usefulness of the process is  the energetic consumption 
which is available for only five studies, the more cost-effective among them appears to be 
dipyrone with the DSA- Cl2/GDE system with 0.049 kWh (g TOC)-1 and with a kapp of 1.2 10 -
3 s-1 aiming at a TOC removal of 63% in 90 min.

D: MCE between x% and y%: x and y are the two extremum value s during the EF treatment 
  80 3.3 EF applied to antibiotics and diuretics  
More studies were done on antibiotics as they are a large group of pharmaceuticals widely used 
all over the world. The kapp values are in the same range for beta-blockers and anti-
inflammatories which demonstrates the ability of this process to treat pharmaceuticals (Fig. 8). 
The better value (26 10-3 s-1) is obtained for flumequine degradation using a BDD/carbon felt 
cell. 17 different pharmaceuticals were degraded through an EF proce ss (Table 8). The 
treatment time for complete oxidative degradation of pollutant is quite different from one 
system to another; it can be of 4.5 h for cefalexin or of 3 min for flumequine; i t is around 30 
min for most cases. The TOC or the DOC (dissolved organic carbon) r emoval is around 6 h for 
most of the experiments. Concerning the MCE, for almost all the experiments the values are 
around 15%, only in one study, this value reached up to 55% for chloramphenic ol, due probably 
to the very high initial pollutant concentration (245 mg L-1). The energy consumption is also in 
the same range as for the other pharmaceuticals being around 1 kWh ( g TOC)-1 or 1 kWh (g 
DOC)-1.  
To sum up, the EF is a clearly efficient process able to degrade  lots of different groups of 
pharmaceuticals. Some points have yet to be studied more deeply. First  in order to apply this 
process at the industrial scale, pilot studies are required to tr eat issues that have been explained 
previously like, for instance, mass transfer. Our group is actually working on a pilot in order to 
evaluate the scaling-up of the EF. To prepare the transition to i ndustrial scale, the EF needs to 
be studied in continuous mode; this has only been done a few times (Table 5). The concentration 
of the pollutant ranges from around 50 mg L-1 to 150 mg L-1 which is significantly higher than 
the concentration in wastewater as discussed in the introduction sec tion. In order to simulate 
the efficiency of the process better and in a more similar c ontext of real wastewater treatment, 
smaller concentrations should be involved or real effluent should be used whi ch has only been 
done a few times (Durán Moreno et al. 2004; Casado and Fornaguera 2008) . Indeed, in a real  81 effluent, due to the presence of several pharmaceuticals, some int eractions between them can 
slow down the process. As the cost remains generally high for minera lization process , 
combining this process with a biological treatment could decrease si gnificantly the operating 
costs. Therefore the cost of the process is to be considered more  deeply. The bio-treatment 
being more cost-effective than the EF, a comparison of their effic iency was done by analyzing 
their apparent kinetic constant for the same pharmaceuticals (Fig.  8). For all the data given in 
Fig. 8, the EF is significantly more efficient. However, the scale of the process is not the same 
as for the bio-treatment an industrial scale is used whereas f or the electro-Fenton the volume is 
around 300 mL. But, for the biological degradation, the limiting parame ter is the degradation 
kinetic, this implies that the scale-up is not impacting too much on t he process; this enables the 
comparison between both processes. Because of this difference of eff iciency, the solution to 
degrade efficiently and at a lower cost can be to combine both proc esses.

pharmaceuticals  
Conventional biological processes in WWTP do not always provide satisfact ory results in terms 
of pharmaceuticals removal (Miège et al. 2009; Luo et al. 2014; Mar got et al. 2015) , since many 
of these organic substances are toxic or resistant to microorganis ms. Therefore, one feasible 
option to remove the persistent organic compounds is to combine biological  treatment with 
EAOPs such as EF. This attractive potential alternative is a solution to reduce the global cost 
which increases with treatment time in EF. 
 
4.1 AOPs as a pretreatment for biodegradability improvem ent  
Two properties of the solution are considered in the literature to a ssess the feasibility of a 
biological treatment: biodegradability and toxicity.  
Biodegradability of the solution is a parameter of great importance when combined treatments 
are considered. It is often defined thanks to the ratio of BOD 5/COD, with BOD 5 the biochemical 
oxygen demand at 5 d. Usually, when this ratio is greater than 0.4, t he solution is considered as 
biodegradable (Pulgarin et al. 1999). Less commonly, one can also fi nd the ratio of BOD 14/COD 
in the literature, BOD 14 being the biochemical oxygen demand at 14 d. The limitation of the 
BOD test is mainly due to the fact that micro-organisms used a s inoculum in the BOD tests 
may not be initially adapted to transform the organic compounds present. T hus, a lag phase is 
often observed during the first days in the BOD curve that can lead to ve ry low values of the 
BOD after 5 d. However, after this lag phase, degradation of the  organic compounds can occur 
leading to a strong increase in the BOD curve. On the contrary, this value can also be under 
estimated when they are different compounds with different biodegradabili ty levels. So, to 
overcome this potential underestimation of the biodegradability of the sol ution, the ultimate  88 BOD (BODu) can be used (Trellu et al. 2016a). Another bias of the use of BOD test is that in 
many papers, the concentration used in the BOD test is not the sam e as in the EF process. Thus, 
as the rate of biodegradation appears to vary with concentration, the  inhibiting effect of the 
organic compounds can be underestimated. For these two main reasons,  results of BOD tests 
should be interpreted with caution.  
Another way to indirectly measure the biodegradability of organic ef fluents which was used in 
the most recent studies is the ratio between COD and TOC. Indeed,  a decrease in COD 
(including oxidation of the pollutant) can promote the decrease of the solution toxicity. A 
decrease of the ratio COD/TOC is a favorable trend for biologica l treatment as there are fewer 
oxidative products (pollutant) and the amount of organic carbon is sufficie nt to feed bacteria 
(Chebli et al. 2010; Annabi et al. 2016). From these two parameters,  the AOS (average 
oxidation state) can be estimated which is given in Eq. 18. This pa rameter enables to 
approximate the degree of oxidation of a solution. The lowest value is -4 for CH 4 and 4 for CO 2 
(Scott and Ollis 1995). 
!"#=%	(()*+*),)
()*             (18) 
with TOC in mg C L-1 and COD in mg O 2 L-1.  
Measuring the toxicity can also be interesting. However, there are  usually errors in the 
interpretation of results. Several methods are used to measure t he toxicity of solutions 
electrochemically pre-treated. In general, ecotoxicological bioass ays standards are used. The 
most commonly used is the bacterial assay Microtox® which is based on natural or provided 
ability of bioluminescence of a bacterial strain. However, as i t is a marine strain, doubts are 
arising due to its application as a reference when a combined treat ment is considered. It should 
be highlighted that the toxicity measured is not representative of the toxicity of adapted 
consortia that are usually employed when biological treatments are c onsidered. Thus with this  89 method, a high toxicity value does not mean that all the micro-organis ms from a consortia will 
be inhibited or killed by the solution. 
The choice of the relevance of the combined process and the order in whic h to apply it, whether 
the biological treatment first and the AOP after or the contrar y, are in general based on the 
biodegradability and toxicity of the solution to be treated. A firs t methodology was proposed 
by Scott and Ollis (1995) who divided the wastewaters into four types. The  first group gathers 
large-size molecules that are not biodegradable (polymers, pestici des, herbicides, emulsifying 
agents,…). In this case, a chemical treatment is advised fir st to hydrolyze the big molecules 
into smaller biodegradable molecules to allow their biodegradation. M antzavinos and Psillakis 
(2004) and Annabi et al. (2016) explained this phenomenon: bigger molecules are  less likely to 
be degraded by a biological treatment as their size prevents them fr om permeating cell walls. 
The second group is formed of molecules with a high biodegradability rate  but also containing 
a small amount of non-biodegradable molecules which will require a post -chemical treatment 
to eliminate the resistant pollutants. Here it is cost-effec tive to start with a biological treatment 
and then use an AOP. The third group is composed of molecules with a toxic activity. In this 
case, an AOP pre-treatment could be preferred. Finally, the fourth group is made of solutions 
that contain molecules that are biologically transformed into dead- end intermediates 
compounds that cannot be further biologically degraded and can lead to strong i nhibition of the 
biological activity. Thus, an additional AOP treatment should be perfor med in order to degrade 
these intermediate molecules (Scott and Ollis 1995) .  
This classification was completed by Comninellis et al. (2008) who a dded the notion of TOC 
to classify the pollutants. They defined 4 groups, one with biodegradable compounds  which 
correspond to the second group of Scott and Ollis and three groups with non- biodegradable 
compounds: (i) wastewaters with a high TOC (> 100 m g L-1) requiring a pre-treatment with an 
AOP before a biological treatment; (ii) wastewaters with a low TOC (< 100 m g L-1) but with a  90 high toxicity; in this case a suitable AOP is necessary to degra de the toxic compounds but a 
biological treatment is not recommended as wastewaters have litt le metabolic value for the 
bacteria; (iii) wastewaters containing non-biodegradable molecules  at low TOC and toxicity 
but with a characteristic which prevents their release, such as colored wastewaters. Here only 
an AOP is advised.  
As it was seen with both classifications, most of the time a n AOP is performed first followed 
or not by a biological treatment as illustrated by Mantzavinos and Psillakis as most of the 
already published works showed a rise in biodegradability and/or a decreas e in toxicity with an 
AOP pre-treatment. But sometimes that is not the case (Mantz avinos and Psillakis 2004; Oller 
et al. 2011) for several reasons: (i) stable intermediates for med may be less degradable than the 
parent compound; (ii) AOPs are not specific, so the biodegradable mole cules can be degraded 
before persistent ones; (iii) finding the good conditions for the pre-trea tment is needed: if too 
short, the solution will not change enough to be treated by activated sludge and if too long the 
process will not be cost-effective; (iv) the compounds used during the AOP can be toxic for the 
biological treatment, for example, O 3 or H 2O2: if they are not eliminated the second treatment 
will n ot be efficient and (v) if a high concentration of halides is used, the AOP process could 
form toxic organic halogens which increase the toxicity of the soluti on (Fang et al. 2016). 
In short, even if some guidelines have been found to classify wastewat ers, performing each 
treatment separately and studying the synergetic effect as well  as measuring the toxicity and 
the biodegradability during each treatment are necessary in order to find the best combination 
with the highest efficiency and the lowest cost. 
 
4.2 Effects of EF on effluents characteristics  
 
4.2.1 Enhancement of biodegradability  91 Table 9 gives an overview of the recent studies in which biodegradabili ty of pharmaceutical 
solutions is investigated, except for the combination of EF with a bi ological treatment, which 
will be more detailed in sub-section 4.3. According to this Table,  among the twelve studies, 
only three studies were performed with both treatments: in two works,  an EF treatment is 
followed by a biological degradation step and in the third one, the treatment is performed in the 
opposite order. In four cases, an EF treatment followed by a biologica l treatment was found 
quite inappropriate as only in one case the solution obtained was very t oxic (L) (Mousset et a l. 
2014), in two studies the final solution have a BOD 5/COD lower than 0.3 after EF treatment 
(G,H) (Elias et al. 2011; Fourcade et al. 2013) and only in one study the biodegra dability level 
was over the limit but the time of treatment was 24 h which made the process too expensive 
(B) (Ledezma Estrada et al. 2012). Meanwhile for those four experiment s (B,G,H,L)  the 
biodegradability was improved. It is only by performing the biological t reatment that it will be 
possible to confirm if this treatment is actually useless. For the others experiments the efficiency 
of combining both processes should work and for some of them it can be r eally interesting in 
order to reduce the operating costs as the EF treatment allows to have a biodegradable solution 
in a short treatment time (C,D,E, F) (Mansour et al. 2012; Chu et al. 2013; Annabi et al. 2016; 
Tian et al. 2016).  92 Table 9: Biodegradability studies with EF and biological treat ments

With biodegradability, toxicity is the second very important paramet er for a biological 
treatment. A dozen studies reported the toxicity assessment of solutions during EF treatments. 
Most of them used the Microtox® test. This was applied to herbicides such as mesotrione and 
diuron, to azo dyes such as acid orange 7 or to pharmaceuticals such as s ulfamethoxazole, 
sulfamethazine and sulfanilamide. For all those studies an increas e of the toxicity was observed 
at the beginning of the EF treatment, this was due to the formation o f intermediate compounds 
more toxic than the parent pollutant. This increase in solution toxic ity was usually attributed to 
cyclic/aromatic by-products which are formed after a few minutes  of electrolysis. As an 
example, one of these intermediates can be hydroquinone, obtained both in  the degradation of 
phenol (Pimentel et al. 2008) and chlorophenol (Yuan and Lu 2005). Then after r eaching a 
plateau in the percentage of inhibition, solution toxicity decreases due to the progressive 
destruction of aromatic/cyclic intermediates and formation of ca rboxylic acids (which are much 
less t oxic) and to the progress in the mineralization of the solution. Depe nding on the starting 
pollutant, the complete removal of toxicity (0% of inhibition ) can be achieved in 2 h as for the 
sulfamethazine or after 8.33 h for the mesotrione. Indeed, as f or the efficiency of the EF process, 
the decrease of toxicity is also different when using, for example , different anode materials 
(mainly BDD or Pt) or different operating parameters such as cur rent intensity or  initial 
concentration of pollutant (Oturan et al. 2008c; Dirany et al. 2011; El- Ghenymy et al. 2014; 
Murati et al. 2014; Barhoumi et al. 2016; Le et al. 2016b) . In the study concerning the 
degradation of the herbicide diuron, the authors performed the toxicity assessment both on 
Vibrio Fischeri (Microtox®) and green algae and found a really different behavior for these two 
different tests. For the algae, toxicity decreases rapidly wher eas for the bacteria the toxicity 
rises because of the intermediates formed and then decreases. T hese results highlight that the 
toxicity observed depends on the organism used in the test. To give an over all information on  97 the toxicity and thus to be more reliable, tests need to be done on seve ral different species or 
methods (Oturan et al. 2008c). Other toxicity assessments were done  by using other species. 
Coledam et al. (2016) studied the degradation of the antibiotic norfloxa cin and measured the 
evolution of toxicity using the bacteria E. Coli showing that the toxicity remained very high 
during the first two hours of EF treatment before starting to decre ase. By identifying reaction 
intermediates, they attributed the toxicity of the solution to fluoroquino lone, a cyclic compound 
that remained in the medium during two h before being degraded. This t est was also performed 
on Daphnia magna , a freshwater crustacean, for the degradation of the azo dye ora nge II. The 
same scheme appeared, a rise in toxicity after 5 min of treat ment and then a decrease of this 
toxicity until no inhibition after one hour of treatment (Lin et al. 2014) . Among all those studies, 
one assessed the cytotoxicity during the degradation of the herbicide sulf entrazone on sheep 
corneal epithelial cells and no toxicity was found for both the parent compound and the by-
products (Lima et al. 2010).  
Toxicity was also measured by the oxidative stress which is a pat hophysiological mechanism 
coming from the imbalance of the production of reactive species and organi sm defenses that 
can lead from molecular damage to the cell death. In a study on t he degradation of Yellow 9 
performed by EF, the activity of catalase was measured in order to evaluate the oxidative stress. 
Indeed, the enzyme catalase is involved in protecting the cell from ox idative stress. Thus a high 
concentration of catalase means that the cell is fighting against  this process. It was found that 
only Yellow 9 induced toxicity as the catalase activity decreased with the time of electrolysis 
(Kourdali et al. 2014). Another study looked at toxicogenomics and evaluated in addition the 
type of stress. Three well-known molecules were studied: bisphenol A,  triclosan and ibuprofen; 
they were chosen because their degradation pathway is quite reliable.  For bisphenol A, a large 
range of stress response was found whereas for its by-products the st ress was concentrated on 
DNA and membrane. For triclosan, an oxidative stress was evaluat ed for the parent compound  98 and for the intermediates; an anomalous production of proteins and an alte ration of the cell 
membrane was assessed. Finally, for ibuprofen, the parent compound al ters the cell transport 
function and induces a high membrane stress. The by-products, as far a s they are concerned, 
promote membrane, protein and DNA stress (Gou et al. 2014). This type  of study is re ally 
interesting to understand better how the toxicity operates and then it i s easier to work with and 
to know when a bio-treatment could be useful.  
In the five last years, only two studies were found dealing with both biode gradability and 
toxicity (H- L) (Elias et al. 2011; Mousset et al. 2014). In order to perform the  combination of 
both EF and biological treatment more studies are in fact needed.   
 
4.3 Combined process applied to pharmaceuticals removal  
4.3.1 Anodic oxidation as pre-treatment for a post-biodegradatio n process  
A few studies reported the experiment of a combined process using a n AOP and a biological 
treatment applied to pharmaceutical wastewater. To the best of our knowledge, the first attempt 
of an hybrid process combining bio-treatment and an electrochemical proc ess was done by 
Carvalho et al. (2007). Biotic degradation products formed during biologic al treatment of a 
synthetic solution of dye Acid Orange 7 was carried out by anodic oxidation using BDD anode 
obtaining a COD removal of 90% and a TOC removal of 30% after 8 h tre atment. Then, some 
works on the combination between biodegradation and AO process were  carried out (Khoufi et 
al. 2009; Ganzenko et al. 2014; Olvera-Vargas et al. 2015a; Olvera-Va rgas et al. 2016b) . During 
the combined process, AO was used as a pre-treatment step followed by an anaerobic digest ion 
and an ultrafiltration to reach 88% of COD removal, 72.5% of color removal and 90% of total 
suspended solids removal with a residence time of 4 h in the EF rea ctor. The use of an aerobic 
treatment was also investigated (Khoufi et al. 2009) .   99 Yahiaoui et al. (2013) used an anodic oxidation process as AOP as a pre-treatment step for a 
biological treatment to degrade the antibiotic tetracycline. The opti mal operating conditions 
were evaluated on a synthetic solution using a central composite design with an electrolytic cell 
equipped with Pb/PbO 2 anode and Pt cathode. In order to keep enough organic carbon to 
perform a biological treatment, the solution was electrolyzed through t he following conditions: 
40 °C, 275 mA, and 100 mg L-1 initial concentration until the complete disappearance of 
tetracycline. Biodegradability was also assessed along the electr olysis and reached a value of 
0.41 after 5 h of treatment. At this point, 36.7% of the initial DOC remained in the medium. 
The aerobic treatment using activated sludge confirmed the beneficial  effect of the biological 
treatment as the combined process reaching 76% DOC removal.  
 
4.3.2 Coupling between EF and bio-treatment 
The combination between EF and biological treatment called bio- electro -Fenton (Bio-EF) has 
been performed by Oturan's group (Olvera-Vargas et al. 2016a; Ganzenko et a l. 2017; Olvera-
Vargas et al. 2018) performing EF step as pre-treatment or post-t reatment for coupling with a 
biological treatment applied to the removal of pharmaceuticals s uch as metoprolol (beta-
blocker), furosemide (diuretic), ranitidine (antihistaminic H2) and real pharmaceutical 
wastewater (Table 10). In particular, the study reported by Olve ra-Vargas et al. (Olvera-Vargas 
et al. 2016a) constitutes a complete and systematic research inc luding toxicity assessment by 
Microtox method as well as MCE and EC data in addition to the eva luation of the 
biodegradability (BOD 5/COD) during EF treatment (Fig. 9). The biodegradability ratio of 0.4 
was reached only after 1 h EF treatment at 500 mA constant current  with 47% TOC removal of 
a solution of the beta-blocker metoprolol. A mineralization rate of 90% is attained after 6 d of 
biological treatment (Fig. 10). The shortness of the EF step allow ed the reduction of a 
significant energy consumption (6 times) compared to EF alone. The evol ution of solution  101

mA and room temperature. Reprinted with permission from ref. (Olvera -Vargas et al. 2016a) . Copyright

For furosemide and ranitidine, some economic considerations were done us ing the French 
industrial price for electricity: 0.08 € (kWh)-1. For 1 h electrolysis the energy cost was of 7.66 
and 9.33 € (kg TOC)-1 for furosemide and ranitidine, respectively, whereas for 8 h ele ctrolysis 
to achieve nearly total mineralization the cost attained 43.03 and 46.77€ (kg TOC)-1 for 
furosemide and ranitidine respectively with EF alone (Olvera-Varga s et al. 2016b). This clearly 
justifies the use of the combined process. For all the combined pr ocesses applied to 
pharmaceutical, the EF was used as a pre-treatment, except t he report of Ganzenko et al. (2017) 
in which pre- and –post-EF scenarios have been performed, usually due to the toxicity of the 
compounds and the low biodegradability of the solution. In the latter work Ganz enko et al. 
(2017), compared the degradation and mineralization of a pharmaceutica l effluent spiked with 
caffeine and 5-fluorouracil with two different orders of treatme nt (EF-B io or B io-EF) (Table 
10). The results demonstrated a quite similar mineralization ( more than 90% of COD removal) 
 102 for both orders but using the EF as pre-treatment appeared to be cost saving. Indeed, the best 
condition for EF-B io was 2  h at 200 mA whereas for B io-EF it required 4 h at 500 mA 
(Ganzenko et al. 2017) .  
The combination of EF treatment with a biological treatment to treat  pharmaceuticals was also 
carried out by Ferrag -Siagh et al. (2013) in which they showed the efficiency of combining 
electro -Fenton process with a biological treatment for the degradation of the antibiotic 
tetracycline. They evaluated different parameters to find the best  conditions for the EF (see 
Table 10). The treatment of tetracycline by biological treatment attained a TOC removal of 
10% which clearly showed the inadequacy of this process due to the low  biodegradability rate 
(BOD 5/COD) = 0.02) of the initial drug solution.  To obtain a biodegradable  solution, EF pre-
treatment was applied to reach 46% and 72% TOC removal and, 0.33 and 0.44 BOD 5/COD 
ratio at 2 and 4 h treatment, respectively. Then the activated sl udge treatment was performed 
during 25 d for the two electrolyzed solutions, obtaining an improvement of 23% and 14% in 
TOC removal for 2 h and 4 h EF pre-treated solutions, respectively (Ferrag -Siagh et al. 2013) . 
The same group also investigated the degradation of tylosin, sulfam ethazine and trimethoprim 
using the combined process obtaining a biodegradable solution (BOD 5/COD ratio ≥ 0.4) after 
EF pre -treatment step before biological treatment. The coupled process w as then successfully 
applied to the treatment of a real effluent coming from a pharmac eutical industry (Ferrag -Siagh 
et al. 2014; Mansour et al. 2014; Mansour et al. 2015a; Mansour et al. 2015b) .  
The efficiency of the combination of both treatment is demonstrated  in terms of TOC or COD 
removal but hardly ever the biodegradability or the toxicity of the solut ion resulting is taken 
into consideration. This point is of major interest as this treatm ent aims at delivering a clean 
water in the environment. One study performed toxicity tests on the t reated solution (Roshini 
et al. 2017). Phytotoxicity tests on Vigna radiada  seeds and microbial toxicity tests on 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa  and Bacillus sp.  were performed in order to demonstrate the  103 efficiency of their combined process for the degradation of textile w astewater. Both tests 
showed a decrease in toxicity. No such test could be found concerning t he pharmaceutica l 
effluent witch is upsetting.  
In all the experiments performed on synthetic solutions as well as on real wastewaters; the cost-
effectiveness and the efficiency of the coupling between EF and bio- treatment was proved. 
However, it should be noticed that as mentioned in section 2.3.5, the el ectrical consumption 
may be significantly different at pilot and full scale. It is also very important to underline one 
of the major drawbacks; the solution pH which is adjusted around 3 in EF  step should be raised 
around 7 for the bio-treatment

2017)  106 5. Conclusions and perspectives  
Wastewaters from hospitals and pharmaceutical industries contain  relatively high 
concentrations of pollutants as they have not already been mixed with other  effluents. As 
highlighted in different publications, the EF process is faster, mo re efficient and more cost-
effective on concentrated solutions of pharmaceuticals. Thus the bes t approach to treat these 
wastewater with EF seems to be the treatment of the wastewaters  directly at the exit of hospitals 
or pharmaceutical production plants.  
A major advantage of EF compared to the non- AOP treatm ents is that this process is able to 
destroy quite every type of pollutants thanks to the non-selectivity of the hydroxyl radicals and 
to reach almost complete mineralization of treated solutions.  
One major problem concerning the EF is its relatively high treatme nt cost when using longer 
treatment time s, required to reach high mineralization degree to destroy resist ant intermediates 
formed during the process. Research was done to reduce this treatme nt cost or enhance the 
efficiency of the EF treatment. These studies were based on the  improvements of geometrical 
parameters or flowing characteristics in order to improve mass  transfer and to limit electrical 
resistance that are in general the limiting steps, on avoiding the addition of external O 2 or on 
using micro -fluidic. Several reactor configurations were proposed and their advant ages and 
drawbacks as well as the best configurations depend on the objectives, on the nature of the 
wastewater (organic pollutants, presence of solid particles, et c.). In order to reach the industrial 
scale with the EF process, more research is needed to assess  the feasibility: (i) to operate in 
continuous mode, (ii) to treat real wastewaters, (iii) to de crease the cost associated to catalyst 
by testing recoverable solid catalyst catalysts at pilot scale.  In terms of engineering, a better 
characterization of the hydrodynamic of the reactors at pilot scale  is required to develop models 
coupling mass transfer phenomena, hydrodynamic behavior, electrochemical re actions, etc. in 
order to predict the efficiency of the reactors and helping to resol ve a number of design aspects  107 required for a mid- term pre -industrialization. In addition, more studies at pilot scale a re required 
to get more information about the energetical consumption of each configu ration. Only few 
studies gathered part of these parameters; this is why it is an  important research focus.  
EF process has demonstrated its efficiency but the treatment cos t is still relatively high (at least 
0.39 k Wh (g TOC)-1) and a good way for saving energy in order to industrialize it, is  its 
combination with a biological treatment. In the case of the treat ment of pharmaceutical 
wastewaters , EF process as a pre-treatment followed by a biological treatm ent proved its 
accuracy. However, all the experiments were performed at labora tory scale and under batch 
conditions. Therefore, for a pre-industrialization of the combined tre atment, experiments must 
be conducted at pilot scale and the feasibility of conducting continuous or s emi-continuous 
reactors must be assessed. The extent of conditioning of the active biomass used for the 
biological treatment to the parent compound, to the reaction intermediat es, or to the compound 
mixtures also needs to be addressed. In addition, more work is needed to determine the 
monitoring parameters to control the reactor's operation. 
Thus to answer some of the previous points, a lab-scale pilot was built for this thesis and it was 
tested to treat different solutions of pharmaceuticals on its one or  combined with a biological 
treatment. This will be developed in the next chapters.   108 References:

   123 1. Introduction  
 
Nowadays, the elimination of pharmaceuticals from wastewaters  has become a hot topic as 
these products are widely consumed all over the world. As an example,  in western Europe 
around 300 mg of active substances are consumed every day per inhabitant (Khe tan and Collins 
2007; Bouissou-Schurtz et al. 2014; Luo et al. 2014; Vergili et al. 2019)  and are hardly removed 
by wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). Indeed, between 60 and 90% of them remain in the 
environment. A study monitored around 50 pharmaceuticals after their tr eatment in WWTP  in 
Europe and the United S tates; the average % of elimination was less than 50% (Jones et al. 
2005; Margot et al. 2015) . Once used, pharmaceuticals are eliminated in whole or in part by the 
human or animal bodies and then enter into the wastewaters of hospitals  or municipalities. 
Wastewaters from pharmaceutical industries constitute another m ain source of drugs in natural 
wate r (Lindsey et al. 2001; Kabdasli et al. 2019). As these molecules a re highly active, they can 
be harmful toward the environment (Boxall 2004; Küster and Adler 2014). T herefore, their 
elimination from wastewater using an efficient treatment proc ess constitutes an important issue.  
The diuretic hydrochlorothiazide ( HCT ) used for anti-hypertensive medications, is of particular 
interest as it was recently found both in hospital effluent (Mendoza et al. 2015) and in surface 
water (Bouissou-Schurtz et al. 2014). Indeed, this molecule was shown to have a n average 
removal rate of 30% from typical WWTP (Margot et al. 2015). In addition, this m olecule was 
reported to be hazardous toward the environment (Fernández et al. 2010) a nd therefore needs 
to be efficiently destroyed before being releas ed into natural water body.  
Nadolol ( Nad) belongs to the b-blockers, it was chosen as it was detected in wastewaters since 
it is not completely removed by wastewater treatment plant s (Gabet-Giraud et al. 2010) . 
Additionally, it is harmful toward the environment (Khetan and Collins 2007 ). 
Tramadol ( TMD ) is a centrally acting analgesic used in case of moderate to severe pain (Ghalwa 
et al. 2014; Antonopoulou and Konstantinou 2016). This medicine is widely used, as  an  124 example in 2012 around 24 tons of TMD was prescribed in Germany (Lütke Ever sloh et al. 
2015). It was not efficiently removed by WWTPs as it was detecte d in effluents from 
households and hospitals even after treatment and in surface waters (Hummel et al. 2006; Rúa-
Gómez and Püttmann 2012; Rúa-Gómez and Püttmann 2013) .  
Ofloxacin ( OFL ) belongs to the antibiotic family which is particularly toxic to micro-
organisms. This molecule was found both in hospital effluents and surfac e water (Table 2 ) 
(Verlicchi et al. 2010). The presence of antibiotics in the environm ent leads to chronic toxicity 
and to the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria, this is why  the substances have to be 
removed from wastewaters (Pulicharla et al. 2015; Changotra et al . 2017; Yu et al. 2019). 
To eliminate persistent pharmaceuticals, the use of highly strong oxidants is thus compulsory. 
Hydroxyl radicals (•OH) seem to be a promising tool as being the second strongest oxidant a fter 
fluorine. They can degrade nearly any type of contaminants thanks to the ir very high oxidation 
potential (E° (•OH/H 2O) =  2.8 V vs SHE in acidic medium) (Sirés and Brillas 2012). The  
advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) (Oturan and Aaron 2014) and particular ly 
electrochemical AOPs (EAOPs) (Brillas et al. 2009; Panizza and Cerisola 2009; Sirés et al. 
2014; Nidheesh et al., 2018) are interesting processes for removal of organic pollutants from 
water as they have shown their ability in high oxidation rate and qua si-complete mineralization 
yield (Bellakhal et al. 2006; Faouzi et al. 2006; Dirany et al. 2012; Ö zcan et al. 2013; Mousset 
et al. 2016) . The electro-Fenton (EF) is one of most popular EAOPs being an environmentally 
friendly and effective process to destroy organic pollutants (Oturan  et al. 2000; Ganiyu et al. 
2018; Monteil et al. 2019). That is why this process was chosen to tr eat the pharmaceutical 
solutions .  
This process is based on the generation of •OH through Fenton's reaction (Eq. 19) in which 
Fenton's reagent (H 2O2 + Fe2+) is in situ electrochemically generated (H 2O2, Eq. 20) or 
regenerated ( Fe2+, Eq. 21) from Fe3+ produced in Fenton's reaction  (Oturan 2000; Brillas et al.  125 2009).  
Fe2+ + H 2O2 ® Fe3+ + OH + •OH–        (19) 
O2 + 2 H+ + 2 e– ® H2O2         (20) 
Fe3+ + e– ® Fe2+          (21) 
The process is electrocatalytic since the catalyst (Fe2+) is continuously electro-generated at the 
cathode. Comparing with classical Fenton's process, the EF process presents several advantages 
(Nidheesh and Gandhimathi 2012; Oturan and Aaron 2014) such as i) the in situ  production of 
H2O2 avoiding the reagent cost and risks related to its transport and s torage,  ii) avoiding the 
precipitation of iron ion (catalyst) under (Fe(OH) 3 form because of its very low concentration 
and thus the formation of process sludge, iii) avoiding or decreasing signi ficantly the rate of 
wasting reactions consuming •OH because of very low concentration of Fenton's reagent in the 
system. 
When using an appropriate anode such as BDD, the process becomes even more  efficient 
(Oturan et al. 2012; Sopaj et al. 2016) due to the formation of heteroge neous hydroxyl radicals 
M(•OH) on the anode surface from electrochemical oxidation of water ( Eq. 22). The M(•OH) 
thus formed are physically adsorbed on anode (M) in the case of non-a ctive anodes like BDD, 
and are available for oxidation of organics (Panizza and Cerisola 2005;  Rodrigo et al. 2010; 
Nidheesh et al., 2019). 
M + H 2O ® M(•OH) + H+ + 2 e–        (22) 
Therefore, this study presents, for the first time, a detaile d investigation of oxidative 
degradation (including kinetics data) and mineralization of the four phar maceuticals from 
different families by the EF process with a BDD anode. The comparison with a Pt anode was 
performed for the HCT. The electrical energy consumed for almost  complete mineralization 
was also considered. Preliminary experiments were carried out t o find optimal operating  126 conditions. The oxidation reaction intermediates and carboxylic acids as well as inorganic ions 
were i dentified using GC-M S, LC -MS, HPLC and ion chromatography analyses, and their 
evolution during electrolysis was followed. Finally, based on this in formation, a plausible 
mineralization reaction pathway was proposed for three pharmaceutic als (HCT, TMD, OFL) .  
 
2. Material and methods  
2.1. Chemicals  
All chemicals used in this study were analytical grade and used as  received without 
further purification. The pharmaceuticals HCT , TMD, Nad and OFL w ere supplied by Sigma 
Aldrich. Iron (II) sulfate heptahydrate (catalyst source, 99%) wa s purchased from Acros 
Organics. Sodium sulfate (Na 2SO 4) (supporting electrolyte), potassium sulfate (K 2SO 4), sodium 
perchlorate (NaClO 4), potassium phosphate monobasic, iron(II) perchlorate were supplied by  
Sigma-Aldrich, Merck, and Acros. Short-chain carboxylic acids (oxa lic acid, oxamic acid, 
acetic acid and maleic acid were obtained from Acros, Fluka and A lfa Aesar. The pollutant 
solutions were prepared with ultrapure water obtained from a Millipor e Milli-Q Simplicity 185 
system with resistivity >18 M Ω cm at 25 °C. The pH of solutions was adjusted using analytical 
grade sulfuric acid (Acros). Organic solvents and other chemicals  used were HPLC or analytic 
grade from Sigma-Aldrich, Fluka and Merck. 
 
2.2. Electrochemical equipment  
All the experiments were performed in an undivided cylindrical gla ss cell of 7 cm diameter and 
with a capacity of 250 mL at room temperature. The 230 mL solution was vigorously stirred by  127 a magnetic PTFE bar to have a good mass transport between the elect rodes and compressed air 
was continuously bubbled into the cell through a silica frit. The air bubb ling was started 5 min 
prior to electrolysis to ensure O 2 saturation in the solution. The electrochemical cell was 
equipped with a 3D carbon felt (18.0 cm × 5.0 cm × 0.5 cm, from Mersen, France), placed on 
the inner wall of the cell covering the total internal perimeter  as the cathode and a 25- cm2 BDD 
film on niobium support as the anode (from CONDIAS GmbH, Germany). A  platinum anode 
with a similar area is used for a few experiments. CyberS can pH 1500 pH meter from Eutech 
Instruments was used to adjust the solution pH to 3 .0 (well -known as the optimal value for 
electro -Fenton process (Kremer 2003; Brillas et al. 2009) using a 1 M H 2SO 4 or NaOH solution. 
A constant current, ranging between 50 and 1000 mA, was supplied with a Ha meg HM8040 
triple power DC supply.  
 
2.3. Analytical methods and procedures  
The concentration decay of pharmaceutical degradation experuments was monitored by HPLC 
using a Merck Lachrom Liquid chromatography equipped with a reverse phase col umn 
Purospher RP-18, 5 µm, 25 cm × 4.6 mm (i.d.) column and coupled with a diode array detector 
(DAD). Samples of 20 µL were injected in the column at 40°C. For the HCT, the detector was 
set at λ = 270 nm and the mobile phase composed of methanol / water 25:75 (v/v) was eluted 
at a flow rate of 0.5 mL min−1. For TMD, the mobile phase was a mixture of methanol / 
phosphate buffer 40:60 (v/v) at a flowrate of 0.6 mL min-1. The wavelength of detection was 
228 nm. The phosphate buffer was composed of 3.5 g of potassium phosphate monobasic  and 
17.8 g of dipotassium hydrogen phosphate in 1 L of ultra-pure water and the pH was adjusted 
to 6.0 using orthophosphoric acid. For the nadolol, the mobile phase was compose d of an 
acetate buffer and methanol (63/37 v/v) at 0.4 mL min-1. The buffer was made of 0.1 M of 
sodium acetate and the pH adjusted to 6 by acetic acid. The wavele ngth of detection was 277  128 nm. Finally, the OFL was eluted by a mobile phase made of acetonit rile and acetate buffer 20/80 
(v/v) at 0.5 mL min-1 and detected at 292 nm. The buffer was composed of 0.05 mol L-1 of citric 
acid and of 1 mol L-1 of ammonium acetate.  
The short-chain carboxylic acids were identified and quantified by the same HPLC equipped 
with a Biorad column (9 µm, 250 mm × 4.6 mm) and the DAD detector was set at 220 nm. The 
mobile phase was a solution of H 2SO 4 at a concentration of 4 mM with a flow rate of 0.6 mL 
min-1. Carboxylic acids were identified by comparison of their retention time with that of 
standard solutions and their quantification was achieved thanks to calibr ation curves.  
Nitrate, nitrite, chloride, sulfate and fluoride ions released to the treated solutions were analyzed 
using a Dionex ICS-1000 Basic Ion Chromatography (IC) system equipped with a DS56 
conductivity detector containing a cell heated at 35 °C using an Ion Pa c AS4A-SC, 25 cm × 4 
mm (i.d.), anion-exchange column, linked to an IonPac AG4A-SC, 5 c m × 4 mm (i.d.), column 
guard. The eluent was a mixture of 1.7 mM sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3) and 1.8 mM sodium 
carbonate (Na 2CO 3) at a flow rate of 1 mL min-1. An ASRS -ULTRA II self -regenerating 
suppressor was used in order to improve the sensitivity of the detector . For ammonium ion 
detection, the same IC equipped with an IonPac CS12A, 25 cm × 4 mm (i.d.), cation-exchange 
column, linked to an IonPac CG12A, 5 cm × 4 mm (i.d.), column guard was used. Again, an 
electrochemical suppressor ( CRS -ULTRA II ) was employed, the. The eluent was a solution of 
9.0 mM sulfuric acid at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min-1. The volume of injections was 25 µL for 
the anions and the cations. 
The mineralization degree of treated solutions was measured tha nks to the total organic carbon 
(TOC) removal of the samples withdrawn from the treated solution at diff erent electrolysis 
times. The TOC measurement was monitored by a Shimadzu VCSH  TOC analyzer according 
to the 680 °C catalytic combustion method using platinum as catalyst. T he injection volume 
was 50 µL. Reproducible TOC values with ± 2% accuracy were found usi ng the non-purgeable  129 organic carbon method. The TOC abatement was calculated by dividing the TOC at time t by 
the TOC at the initial time. 
From these data, the mineralization current efficiency (MCE) va lue for each trial was then 
estimated from Eqs. 23 .

GC-MS analyses were done by using a Thermo Scientific devise equipped wit h a TRACE 1300 
gas chromatography coupled to an ISQ single quadrupole mass spectrophotometer  operating in 
electron ionization mode at 70 eV. A 1 mM HCT and TMD solutions w ere electrolyzed during  130 10 min and 8 min respectively and then the 230 mL aqueous solutions w ere extracted two times 
with ethyl acetate and dichloromethane. Then the organic phase was dr ied over MgSO 4, filtered 
and concentrated to dryness with a rotary evaporator under vacuum. A few drops of ethyl 
acetate were added into the flask to dilute the residual solid phas e and 3 µL of this solution were 
then injected into the GC-MS analyser through a TG-5M s 0.25 mm, 30 m 0.25 mm (i.d.), 
column. The temperature of the injector and detector were 200 and 250°C,  respectively. Helium 
was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.5 mL min-1. The temperature ramp was as following 
for the HCT: 40°C (held during 2 min), 10 °C min-1 to 280°C and 4 min at 280 °C and for the 
TMD: 100 °C during 1 min, 20 °C min-1 to 280 °C and kept at this temperature for 15 min. The 
mass spectra were identified by using Xcalibur datalibrary softwar e for the aliphatic molecules 
and by analyzing the different mass spectrum for the aromatic compounds.  For the aliphatic 
molecules, a derivatization procedure was used. 100 µL of the solution containing the solid 
phase diluted in ethyl acetate was added to 100 µL of BSTFA (N,O-bis -
(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide), the final solution was put a t 80°C for 1 h in an incubator. 
Then the mixture was cooled to room temperature and 3 µL were inj ected into the GC-MS .  
LC-MS analysis were performed for the Nad and the OFL using an H ypersil Gold column (100 
mm × 2.1 mm) 1.9 µ, at 40 °C and with a liquid flowrate of 0.2 mL min-1. After drying the 
sample, the OFL was diluted in 1 mL of methanol / water 50/50 (v/v) and eluted by 0.1% formic 
acid / methanol 80/20 (v/v). Concerning the MS conditions, the ESI+ (electrospray ionization) 
mode was used at 90 V. For the Nad, the evaporated solution was dil uted in 1 mL of water and 
eluted by the same conditions. The ESI+ mode was also used at 75 V.  
When error bars are given on the graphs, they are calculated based on t he standard deviation of 
the different experiments. 
  131 3. Results and Discussion  
3.1. Influence of the operating parameters on the degradati on kinetics  
There are several parameters affecting the performance of the  EF process during oxidation of 
organic pollutants. Among these parameters some are now well-known ( Brillas et al. 2009; 
Oturan and Oturan 2018) : solution pH (= 3.0), nature of the catalyst (Fe2+), nature of electrolyte 
(Na 2SO 4). The temperature has a very little effect. However, for a given anode/cathode couple, 
the effect of two parameters: concentration of the catalyst ( Fe2+) and the value of applied 
current, should be studied to have optimal operating values for an ef fective treatment. The 
nature of the anode is also very important to have an efficient degra dation.  
 
3.1.1. Effect of the concentration of Fe2+  
The concentration of ferrous irons, used as catalyst, is one of the  key parameters for an effective 
degradation of organic pollutants because it is directly linked to the formation of •OH through 
Fenton's reaction (Eq. 19). To clarify the effect of catalyst c oncentration, experiments were 
done using 0.1 mM concentration of pharmaceuticals at 100 mA constant curre nt. As shown in 
Figs. 12-15 , rising the concentration of Fe+ from 0.05 mM to 0.1 mM (from 0.05 mM to 0.2 
mM for the case of TMD, Fig. 13) increases the amount of •OH formed and thus allows a 
quicker degradation of pharmaceuticals. However the concentrations above 0.1 mM Fe2+ for 
HCT, OFL and Nad and 0.2 mM for TMD lead to a decrease in oxidati on kinetics that can be 
explained by the increase of the rate of the wasting reaction given in Eq. 26. Indeed, at high 
concentration of Fe2+, this reaction can compete with oxidation of the pollutants for •OH leading 
to a decrease in degradation kinetics (Panizza and Cerisola 2001; Dom inguez et al. 2018b) .  
•OH + Fe2+ ® Fe3+ + OH–         (26)  132 To evaluate quantitatively the effect of iron concentration on degrada tion rate of the pollutants, 
apparent rate constants of oxidation reaction were calculated ass uming pseudo-first order 
reaction kinetics. Indeed, the experimental conditions being kept consta nt during the 
experiments, the formation rate of •OH/M(•OH) can be considered constant. On the other hand, 
the steady-state assumption can be applied to the concentration of hydrox yl radicals as they are 
very reactive species and cannot be accumulate in the medium (Siré s et al. 2007a; Brillas et al. 
2009). Indeed the exponential decrease of the concentration in each case  confirms this 
hypothesis. Accordingly, the value of apparent rate constant for oxidation of pharmaceuticals 
can be calculated from the slop of the straight lines obtained by plot ting Ln (C/C 0) = f(t) as 
shown on the inset panels of the Figs . 12-15.

3.1.2. Effect of the applied current on the degradation kinetics   
The applied current is one of the most important parameters in EAO Ps in general and in EF in 
particular for the degradation of organic pollutants . Fig s. 16-19 illustrate the results obtained 
for currents rang ed from 50 to 500 mA. For all the currents, the mass transfer is limiting the 
reaction. The se results highlight that high current values promote the oxidative degradat ion 
kinetics of pharmaceutical under study due to the increase in the for mation rate of the Fenton's 
reagent through the enhancement of electrochemical reactions (Eqs. 20-22)  and therefore the 
amount of •OH/M(•OH) in the bulk solution (Eq. 19) and on the anode surface (Eq. 22). The 
production of high amount of •OH/M(•OH) leads to the high degradation rate of the organics 
(Ren et al. 2019). The results obtained in this study highlight the high eff iciency of the EF 
treatment of the pharmaceuticals HCT , TMD,  Nad and OFL  solutions as these solutions were 0.00.20.40.60.81.0

b 135 completely oxidatively degraded in 15, 10, 12 and 10 min, respectively,  at 500 mA constant 
current electrolysis. The apparent rate constants were also ca lculated for each current and 
pollutant. They were of 0.14, 0.19, 0.29 and 0.39 min-1 for 50, 100, 300 and 500 mA 
respectively for the HCT (Fig. 16) and of 0.70, 0.71 and 0.26 min-1 at 500 mA for TMD (Fig. 
17), OFL (Fig. 1 8) and Nad (Fig. 19), respectively. For all the trend curves a  good correlation 
coefficients were found proving the good accuracy of the pseudo first order reaction model. 
Nevertheless, the use of too high currents can promote side reac tions such as H 2 evolution on 
the cathode or O 2 evolution on the anode (Zhang et al. 2007; Oturan and Oturan 2018) . This 
behavior is visible as the rate constants do not increase proportionall y to the applied current 
because of th is enhancement of rate of side reactions with current, causing thus a  loss in process 
efficiency. The increase of the current also promotes the format ion of gas bubbles which 
decreases the conductivity of the solution and thus the process efficie ncy. Moreover, using a 
higher current increases electrical energy consumption and consequently process cost. 
Therefore, a good compromise has to be found between a suitable effici ency and a rational 
operating cost.

To consider the effect of the ions present in a real wastewater  on the degradation of the HCT, a 
synthetic solution was prepared by adding different ions. The concentration of ions used were 
at the level of a real wastewater coming from an industrial producti on sites of antibiotics 
(Marcelino et al. 2016). Results are given in Fig. 20. There i s a small decrease in the kinetic of 
degradation probably due to scavenging reactions with the added ions.  0.00.20.40.60.81.0

3.2. Influence of the anode material  on the degradation kinetics  
The degradation of the Nad was also studied using a platinum anode. The  Nad decay is 
represented in Fig. 21 for different current values. As for the BDD anode, the degradation 
efficiency is increasing with current until 500 mA. For 1000 mA, t he kinetic curve is very 
similar to the one of 500 mA due to side and wasting reactions consuming the electrical energy 
and the hydroxyl radicals. The complete oxidation of Nad needs 40 min elec trolysis at 300, 500 
and 1000 mA which is much higher than for the degradation with the BDD being of 10 , 12 and 
20 min for 1000, 500 and 300 mA, respectively. This is due to the nature of anode material:  
BDD promotes the formation of high amounts of adsorbed hydroxyl radicals (due to its high 
O2 evolution overpotential). Moreover, the BDD(•OH) is weakly sorbed on BDD surface 
enabling it to react easily with organics (Marselli et al. 2003) whereas the interaction is muc h 
stronger (chemisorption) in the case of Pt(•OH).  Table 11 gives the value of the apparent rate 00.20.40.60.81

constants for Pt anode are not increasing proportionally to the current f or the same reasons. The 
degradation constants for both Pt and BDD are quite similar in ea rly electrolysis times (t < 8 
min). Indeed, BDD(•OH) degrade and mineralize simultaneously whereas Pt(•OH) mostly 
degrade which result in a very similar degradation. This behavior wa s found in other already 
published reports for high currents (Guinea et al. 2008; El-Ghenymy et a l. 2014; Sopaj et al. 
2016).

3.3. Determination of the absolute rate constant for o xidation  of four 
pharmaceuticals by hydroxyl radicals  
The absolute (second order) rate constant of the oxidation of the pharma ceuticals under study 
by hydroxyl radicals was determined using the competition kinetics method following the Eq. 
27 (Oturan et al. 2000). Benzoic acid (BA) was selected as the standard competitor since the 
rate constant for its oxidation by .OH ( kBA = 4.3 x 109 M-1 s-1) is well -known (Buxton et al. 
1988).

To determine kP, the electrolysis of equimolar concentration of the pharmaceutica l under study 
and BA is performed under electro-Fenton conditions at 50 mA applied current. The decay in 
the concentration of both compounds was carried out over short electrolysis time and at lower 
current to avoid the interference of intermediate products. The deter mination of kP was then 
done thanks to the slope of the regression line of Fig. 22 which was built following Eq. 27. The 
absolute rate constants were  found to be: (4.37 ± 0.04) Î 109, (5.59 ± 0.03) Í 109, (5.63 ± 0.03) 
Í 109 and ( 5.55 ± 0.05) Í 109 M-1 s-1 for HCT, TMD, Nad and OFL, respectively. These values 
are very close and highlight the similar reactivity of the hydroxyl radicals towards four 
pharmaceutical selected.

3.4. Mineralization of the pharmaceuticals  
The mineralization of different pharmaceutical solutions w as assessed by monitoring TOC  
measurements during treatment. The MCE and EC were then evaluate d based on TOC removal 
data for different applied currents in order to find the bette r efficiency related to a lower cost. 
The nature of the anode was also considered by comparing the use of a BDD  and Pt electrode. 
The measurements were carried out for currents ranging from 100 to 1000 mA.

solutions 
As can be seen in Fig. 23, the TOC removal is faster at ear ly treatment times and for high 
currents. Indeed the mineralization of 0.1 mM pharmaceuticals sol ution s last s for 6 h for 300, 
500 and 1000 mA, reaching TOC removal rates of 85%, 95%, 94% and 94% at 100 mA under 
same operating conditions, for HCT, TMD, Nad and OFL, respectivel y. Complete 
mineralization is attained at 500 and 1000 mA for all cases. However  the increase in 
mineralization degree is not proportional to the applied current, parti cularly at high currents, as 
can be seen with the distance between the curves. The exponential de crease of TOC is due to 
the relatively easy degradation of the pharmaceuticals and their arom atic oxidation 
intermediates at early treatment times. Inversely, the miner alization efficiency becomes 
significantly slow er at longer treatment times due to the formation of the aliphatic  compounds 
such as carboxylic acids which are more resistant to hydroxyl radic als (Brillas et al. 2009; 
Oturan and Aaron 2014) and the decrease in the amount of organic matter i n the solution (Brillas 
et al. 2009; Yang et al. 2019). This phenomenon is also illustrated by the MCE values 
representing the part of the current which mineralizes the pollutant.  The MCE values are 
decreasing highlighting less mineralization efficiency for longer t reatment times . The decrease 
in mineralization efficiency with higher currents is mainly due to  the raise in the rate of side 
reactions, decreasing the oxidative ability of hydroxyl radicals towa rds organic contaminants. 
Among those reactions, the most occurring ones are the oxidation of BDD(.•OH) (Eq. 28) and 
the wasting of •OH by H 2O2 (Eq. 29) (Brillas et al. 2009; Oturan and Aaron 2014). 
2 M(•OH) ® 2 M + O 2 + 2 H+ + 2 e–        (28) 
H2O2 +  •OH ® HO 2 + H 2O          (29)  144 The maximum MCE values are obtained for 100 mA (as expected) for 1 h of treatment, reaching 
10, 12, 15 and 17% for HCT, TMD, Nad and OFL, respectively. The m ineralization rates are 
between 5 and 10% for 300 mA and below 5% for 500 and 1000 mA, for all the four 
pharmaceuticals showing an important loss of energy. This low efficie ncy can be increased by 
using higher concentrations, for example. This was demonstrated by Bril las’ group who 
degraded different concentrations of propranolol and could reach nearly 100% of  MCE with 
616 mg L-1 (Isarain -Chávez et al. 2010b) at the beginning of the treatment.  
The evolution of EC during the treatment of 0.1 mM of pollutants by EF is presented in Fig. 
24. This parameter is also growing with the current and the treatme nt time, as expected, since 
the same current value is applied along electrolysis with lower M CE over longer electrolysis 
times. The results show that EC maximum values are around 16, 12, 12 and 7 kWh (g TOC)-1 
for HCT, TMD, OFL and Nad, respectively, after 6 h  electrolysis at 1000 mA. Considering the 
values of MCE and mineralization degree, the more efficient curr ents seem to be 300 mA and 
500 mA for all the pharmaceuticals for a cost effective process.  The mean EC values for those 
currents is around 2 kWh (g TOC )-1.

3.4.2 . Influence of the anode material on the mineralization effic iency 
The TOC decay was measured for both BDD and Pt anode under differe nt currents ranging 
from 100 mA to 1000 mA and results are depicted on the Fig. 25. For the  BDD anode, the TOC 
decay is increasing with the current intensity, reaching a total mineralization of the solution in 
6 hours for both 500 and 1000 mA. The very similar trend between these tw o curves is due to 
waste reactions degrading BDD(•OH) or H 2O2 for example (Eqs. 30-32) or to the generation of 
weaker oxidants such as S 2O82- or O 3 (Eq. 33 and 34) occurring at high currents (Panizza and 
Cerisola 2005; Guinea et al. 2008; Brillas et al. 2009; Oturan and A aron 2014) .

For the Pt anode, the increase of the current also results in higher  mineralization rate until 300 
mA. Higher currents increase the efficiency of side reactions t hat hinder the generation or favor 
the consumption of •OH/ Pt(•OH) (Eqs. 11 and 28). This decrease in efficiency happens at lower  
currents than for the BDD because the homogeneous •OH reacts with the iron (Eq. 26) at the 
same kinetic rate than homogeneous •OH with carboxylic acids and Pt(•OH) are less efficient 
than BDD(•OH) in the oxidation process. In other studie s (Sopaj et al. 2016), this result was 
also obtained and they performed the anodic oxidation treatment to compare the role of •OH/ 
M(•OH). The difference of efficiency is explained by the predominant role of M(•OH) in the 
mineralization process compared to homogeneous •OH especially for long treatment times (6h) 
which enables the pollutant to reach the anode surface/diffusion layer . Thus as it was previously 
explained for the degradation, as BDD(•OH) are more formed and slightly adsorbed onto the 
anode surface their efficiency is much higher than Pt(•OH).   150

ions  
The cleavage of aromatic/cyclic moieties of organic compounds under oxidative action of 
hydroxyl radicals is known to form aliphatic compounds that are further  oxidized to carboxylic 
acids (Brillas et al. 2009; Dirany et al. 2012). In order to w ell understand the degradation of the 
organics, formed short-chain carboxylic acids during mineralization expe riments were 
identified and their evolution was followed by HPLC using an ion-exclus ion column. The 
evolution of the carboxylic acids created during the degradation process is presented in Figs. 
28-31. For the HCT, oxamic, oxalic, maleic and acetic acids we re detected and followed until 
4 h of treatment. Maleic acid was completely degraded in 90 min, likely being transformed to 
oxalic and acetic acids which are more recalcitrant (Oturan et al. 2008b). Oxamic acid could be 
formed from the degradation of compounds containing an amino group (Garcia -Segura and 
Brillas 2011). The higher accumulation of oxalic (0.009 mM) and oxamic acid (0.0045 mM) 
after 1 h treatment can be explained by their recalcitrant behavior towards •OH/BDD(•OH). For 
TMD, three carboxylic acids were identified: glyoxylic acid, oxalic acid and fumaric acid. The 
most important one was glyoxylic acid for which the concentration reached 0.07 mM after 1 h 
of treatment. The fumaric acid was accumulated in the solution only at trace level (around 10-5 
mM); it was probably oxidized quickly into glyoxylic and/or oxalic acids. After 6 h of 
electrolysis, all the identified carboxylic acids were not anymore  detectable in accordance with 
the very low value of TOC (section 3.4.) in these conditions. Duri ng the Nad degradation, 
oxalic, oxamic, acetic, glyoxylic and formic acids were formed.  Glyoxylic disappeared after 
1.5 h of EF treatment, possibly transform ed into formic acid (Oturan et al. 2008b). Oxalic and 
oxamic acids were  again found to be the more resistant; they could be detected until 4 h of EF 
treatment. For OFL, acetic, oxalic and oxamic acids were  formed during the oxidation process  152 with a maximum concentration peak at about 1 h. Fumaric acid was de tected in trace 
concentration. Then after 6 h they were  all mineralized.

During the mineralization of organics, the heteroatoms present in t he initial molecules are 
oxidized to their higher (often to the highest) oxidizing state and r eleased to the solution as 
inorganic ions. Thus the evolution of inorganic ions formed during the miner alization of the

Acetic acid 154 3 N atoms of the HCT and OFL molecules (0.1 mM) and the N atom of TMD  and Nad were  
mineralized into NH 4+ and NO 3-. The presence of NO 2- was not detected. After 4 or 6 h 
electrolysis, the largest amount of NH 4+ was measured. In order to confirm this behavior, 1 mM 
solutions of NH 4+ and NO 3- were separately electrolyzed at different currents using K 2SO 4 as 
supporting electrolyte and 0.1 mM Fe2+ as catalyst and the results are detailed in the Fig 36 . 
After 8 h treatment, the concentration of NH 4+ was still equal to its initial value (1 mM) whereas 
NO 3- was totally transformed into NH 4+ (Fig. 36). These results confirm the data obtained 
during the mineralization of HCT and highlight the electro-reduction of  NO 3- into NH 4+ taking 
the advantage of the large 3D surface of carbon-felt cathode. Simil ar results were already 
reported by Martin De Vidales et al. (2016) and G arcia -Segura et al. (2018) .  
The mineralization of the 2 S atoms of the HCT molecule was done with complete release of 
SO 42- ion (0.2 mM) into the solution after 2 h electrolysis confirming the r apid mineralization 
of entire S atoms . Concerning the Cl atom, the concentration of Cl- reached 0.086 mM after 30 
min treatment before starting to decrease gradually due to its oxida tion at BDD anode to the 
chlorine gas Cl 2, which then reacts with water to form HClO (under EF condition of pH near 
3). Chlorate and perchlorate can also be formed as the EF process is applied but those molecules 
could not be measured on the IC. This latter compound is an active chlorine spec ie that can 
contribute to the oxidation of HCT in the solution (Randazzo et al. 2011;  Brito et al. 2015) . 
Finally, the F atom of the OFL was completely released into F- ion in 2 h of electro-Fenton 
treatment.   155

3.5. Proposition mineralization pathway  
It was not possible to identify the intermediates for Nad with the  LC-MS analysis. Therefore 
the mineralization pathways were suggested for HCT, TMD and OFL ba sed on GC- MS, LC-
MS, ion-exclusion HPLC, ion chromatography analyses and TOC removal data.  
3.5.1. Mineralization of HCT by hydroxyl radicals 
In order to propose a mineralization pathway, the oxidation intermedi ates and the end-products 
were investigated. In addition to the identified short-chain carboxyl ic acids which constitute the 
last stage of the mineralization process and mineral ions as e nd-products, aromatic/cyclic 
intermediates formed during oxidation of HCT were also analyzed using G C-MS. These 
compounds were identified thanks to their molecular mass and fragment ations behavior (Annex 00.20.40.60.81

HCT (A) is first transformed into chlorothiazide which is possi bly obtained by the double attack 
of hydroxyl radicals on the hydrogen linked to the nitrogen first and then on the  hydrogen linked 
to the carbon connected to the nitrogen, as already reported by Borowska et al. (2016) . This 
chlorothiazide is then whether  hydrolyzed in acidic medium to give the product B or a 
substitution of – NH 2 group by – OH occurs to give product C. The intermediate D can be formed 
by simultaneous ipso-substitution of Cl (following an ipso attack of •OH on –Cl position 
(Mousset et al. 2018)) and abstraction of H atom from -NH group linked t o sulfonic acid group. 
The intermediates B and C were also reported by Borowska et al. (2016). The major pathway 
may be the formation of compound C as this peak is higher than that of B and D. The 
intermediate E can be formed from B, C or D following consecutive attacks of •OH leading to 
the opening of N-N bond and desulfonation. Subsequent hydroxylation of E leads to the 
formation of compounds F, G and H. The quinone ( G and H) are probably formed through 
previous formation of hydroquinones (that are not identified in this study proba bly because of 
their quick oxidation to quinone forms). Finally the compound I is formed from oxidation of 
the lateral group of G. These final polyhydroxylated compounds are not stable and undertake 
oxidative ring opening reactions to form carboxylic acids (compound J to P). The oxidation of 
these short-chain carboxylic acids by •OH/M(•OH) constitutes the last stage of the 
mineralization, i.e., transformation to CO 2, H 2O and ammonium ion. The results obtained for 
the inorganic ions released are in accordance with the degradation pa thway as ammonium ions 
are released after chlorine and sulfate ions.   159

Gathering the results of sub-section 3.4 .2. and the GC-MS results, it was possible to propose a 
degradation pathway for EF treatment of TMD (Fig. 38 ). Intermediates B to G were identified 
thanks to the fragmentation analysis of GC-MS spectrum, intermedi ates H, I and J were 
identified by ion-exclusion HPLC  analysis. Two main routes can be established following paths 
from A to G or from A to F. In the first pathway, an O-demethylation associated with N-
demethylations can transform TMD ( A) into molecule D. These reactions were also reported 
during the degradation of TMD by ferrate and ozone (Zimmermann et a l. 2012) and by 
electrochemical oxidation (Lütke Eversloh et al. 2015). The attac k of hydroxyl radicals can also 
produce a dehydration of TMD producing intermediate B following an O -demethylation. This 
molecule is then degraded in product E by two N-demethylations. The further attack of 
hydroxyl radicals on the tertiary carbon of molecules E and D leads to the formation of molecule 
G by releasing ammonium ions (Giannakis et al. 2017; Lambropoulou et al. 2 017). The second 
route starts with the N-demethylation of TMD and the hydroxylation of the  aromatic cycle 
giving molecule C which is then followed by an O-demethylation to forms intermediate F. 
Finally oxidative ring opening reactions lead to the formation of carbox ylic acids H, I and J 
(Fig. 38 ).  
  162 3.5.3 . Proposed mineralization pathway for oxidation of OFL  by hydroxyl radicals  
During the EF treatment of the OFL, four main routes of degradation  could be identified thanks 
to HPLC and LC-MS analysis (Fig. 39 ). The structure modification happens at four different 
groups of the molecule; piperazinyl substituent, fluorine atom, quinolone moie ty and to the 
cycle containing oxygen and azote atoms. Different degradation pathways of the OFL occurring 
during its oxidation under action of OH are depicted in Fig. 39. For the piperazinyl group, two 
types of degradation can occur: an S abstraction of H atom leading to the elimination of the 
methyl group to form intermediate E or a T abstraction where an hydrogen from the cycle is 
eliminated enabling the formation of molecules C, D and G. These types of degradation were 
already found during the degradation of levofloxacin by ozonation (Witte et  al. 2009), during 
the photocatalytic treatment of ofloxacin (Vasquez and Hapeshi 2013) and during the 
degradation of ciprofloxacin by ozonation (Dewitte et al. 2008). Further ox idation by hydroxyl 
radicals on the piperazinyl substituent can lead to the formation of m olecules H and I (Hapeshi 
et al. 2013; Pi et al. 2014). Finally the whole piperazinyl can be r eplaced by an hydroxyl group 
as in molecules B and F. Concerning the fluorine atom, it can be released in the solution as  F- 
by an ipso attack of the hydroxyl radicals (Michael et al. 2013; Mouss et et al. 2018). The 
quinolone can be transformed, by the loss of C 3O, in a carboxylic group as in molecule E 
(Michael et al. 2013) or in an enone group as in molecule A and G (Vasquez and Hapeshi 2013; 
Pi et al. 2014; Yahya et al. 2014). Finally, the cycle containing the oxygen and the azote can 
loss C 2 (molecule C) or C 3 (molecule D, G and I), this was also found for the ozonation 
treatment of the OFL (Tay and Madehi 2015). 
At the end of the degradation after oxidative ring opening reactions, three carboxylic acids 
could be identified ( J, K, L ).    163

I 164 3.5. Conclusions  
The results and discussion done above show that the pharmaceutical soluti ons under study were 
efficiently treated reaching high mineralization rates by EF process under the best operating 
conditions: catalyst (Fe2+) concentration of 0.1 mM except for TMD ( 0.2 mM ), and currents 
between 300 and 500 mA in 0.05 M Na 2SO 4 as supporting electrolyte. The absolute rate 
constants for oxidation of HCT, TMD, Nad and OFL by hydroxyl radicals w ere also determined 
using the competition kinetics method and found to be  (4.37 ± 0.04) Î 109, (5.59 ± 0.03) Í 
109, (5.63 ± 0.03) Í 109 and (5.55 ± 0.05) Í 109 M-1 s-1 respectively. The complete 
mineralization of 0.1 mM of all the pollutant solutions was reached at 6 h treatment. Finally, 
this study ends by proposing a plausible mineralization pathway of the three pharmaceuticals 
(HCT, TMD and OFL) by hydroxyl radical generated in EF process. These results illustrate the 
non-selectivity of the hydroxyl radicals, being able to eliminate near ly any organic compounds . 
The EF treatment is steel at scale up stage. Some pilots were buil t and successfully tested which 
suggest the possible use of this process at pre-industrial scale. T his point will be discussed in 
next chapter. The idea would be to implement this system at the ex it of industrial companies as 
the treatment is more efficient when the pollutant concentration i s higher.

   172    173 1. Introduction  
Electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) such as anodic oxidation (AO) and 
electro -Fenton (EF) are promising technologies to eliminate persistent and harmful organic 
pollutants from the environment (Iniesta et al. 2001; Hupert et al. 2003; Brillas et al. 2009) . 
EAOPs produce strong oxidants, such as hydroxyl radicals which are able to degrade in a non-
specific way nearly any type of pollutants as they are the strongest ox idants after fluorine (E0 = 
2.8 V vs SHE  in acidic medium) (Eq. 8). EAOPs are able to achieve both degradation and 
mineralization of a large range of organic pollutants and effluents such as landfill leachate 
(Oturan et al. 2015; Zhou et al. 2016), pesticides (Rodrigo et al. 2014b; Dominguez et al. 
2018a), dyes (Alcocer et al. 2018; Nidheesh et al. 2018) or pharmaceuti cals (García -Montoya 
et al. 2015) . The efficiency of these processes mainly depends on electrode mate rials, 
configuration of the electrochemical device, operating conditions, etc.  (Monteil et al. 2018) . 
Boron-doped diamond (BDD) is a particularly interesting anode materia l as it has a strong 
ability for oxidation of organic compounds and a long lifetime (Panizza et al. 2001; Actis et al. 
2008; Cañizares et al. 2008; Brillas et al. 2009; Wei et al. 2011) . BDD has a high overvoltage 
of oxygen evolution reaction allowing a large window for generation at its surface weakly 
adsorbed hydroxyl radicals.  
The influence of the different operating parameters on the effici ency of these processes is now 
well-known and understood thanks to studies performed at lab-scale in batch condi tions. The 
current, the concentration of pollutant or the concentration of the cat alyst (mainly Fe2+ ion) 
were studied in order to optimize the kinetics of degradation at the lower cost. Besides, several 
studies have identified the mineralization pathways of various pollutants  (Sirés et al. 2010; 
Dirany et al. 2012; Loaiza-Ambuludi et al. 2013; Bocos et al. 2016b; Domingue z et al. 2018a; 
Ganiyu et al. 2018) , and sometimes the toxicity of the resulting solution was assessed (Oturan 
et al. 2008c; Dirany et al. 2012). The challenge is now to scale  up the process in order to move  174 towards industrialization for removal of recalcitrant organic poll utants from water. Particularly, 
the development of continuous flow reactors is required in order to over come the traditional 
limitations of conventional batch reactors for the treatment of lar ge flow of effluents (Liang et 
al. 2008; Basha et al. 2012; Ling et al. 2015; Pillai and Gupta 2015; Rahma ni et al. 2016; Pillai 
and Gupta 2017; Borzyszkowska and Espinoza-montero 2018). 
A first step in scaling up is to move from lab-scale batch s tudies to the development of 
engineered pilot-scale continuous reactors. At this scale, only few studies have analyzed the 
influence of operating parameters such as current and catalyst concent ration on the performance 
of the reactor (El-Ghenymy et al. 2013a; Olvera-vargas et al. 2015; Ren et al. 2016) . Few studies 
have considered the influence of hydrodynamic conditions in the reactor, whi ch becomes a key 
parameter for this kind of application. For instance, the link be tween the hydrodynamic and the 
degradation of phenol was examined by Polcaro et al. (2007) and Saravanatham izhan et al. 
(2008). The reactor had a simple hydrodynamic configuration, which was repr esented by a 
continuous-stirred tank reactor (CSTR) (Polcaro et al. 2007) or by a CSTR with a bypass, active 
and dead zones with exchange flow between the active and the dead zone ( Saravanathamizhan 
et al. 2008). In another study, a continuous multi- cell react or was implemented and the model 
of a plug flow reactor was found to describe accurately this syste m (Ling et al. 2015). However, 
there is a real need to go further in the analysis of the link  between hydrodynamics and the 
efficiency of the continuous reactors since hydrodynamics governs the charac teristic times of 
mixing and the retention time of pollutants in the reactor. The hydr odynamic behavior of pilot 
scale continuous reactors is in general more complex than lab scale  reactors that follow CSTR 
behavior. Some behavioral deviations from ideal reactors may appear suc h as the presence of 
dead and recirculation zones or short circuit that affect the global efficiency of the process. 
There is thus a need to perfectly know the influence of the operationa l parameters such as flow  175 rate, reactor configuration or aeration on the hydrodynamic behavior of the reactor in order to 
optimize its efficiency. 
In this context, the present work focuses on a new pilot-scale reac tor operating in continuous 
mode. Hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) , a diuretic, was chosen as a model pollutant as (i) it could 
be found in effluents from hospitals (Mendoza et al. 2015), (ii) it is  hardly removed by 
wastewater treatment plants (Margot et al. 2015), (iii) it s  occurrence in surface water has been 
evidenced (Bouissou-Schurtz et al. 2014) and (iv) it is harmful toward the environment 
(Fernández et al. 2010). First, an empirical design of experiments  (DOE) approach was used to 
identify the most critical operating parameters for the efficie ncy of the process such as current 
density, iron concentration, flow rate and the reactor configuration with the number of 
electrodes and the distance between them. Secondly, the influence of f low rate and reactor 
configuration on the efficiency of hydrodynamics was studied in depth and l inked with the 
efficiency of the process. Finally, a hydrodynamic retention time dis tribution (RTD) model was 
developed and combined for the first time with a kinetic model in order  to describe the 
mineralization of pollutants by EAOPs in such new pilot scale continuous  reactor.   
 
2. Materials and m ethods  
 
2.1. Chemicals  
The pharmaceutical HCT (C 7H8ClN 3O4S2, purity >99%) and sodium sulfate (Na 2SO 4), the 
supporting electrolyte, were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. HCT  solutions were prepared with 
ultrapure water obtained from a Millipore Milli-Q Simplicity  185 system with resistivity  >18 
MΩ cm at 25 °C. The pH of the solutions was adjusted using analytical grade  sulfuric acid or 
sodium hydroxide (Acros). Organic solvents and other chemicals used w ere HPLC or analytic 
grade from Sigma-Aldrich, Fluka and Merck.  176  
2.2. Electrochemical equipment  
The electrochemical reactor made of plexiglass was equipped with two different configurations. 
In the first configuration, the reactor is composed of 7 anodes and 7 cathodes separat ed by 4 
cm each other (Fig. 40), in the second one it is composed of 14 anodes and 14 cathodes 
separated by 2 cm each other. Anodes are made of BDD film on niobi um support (from 
CONDIAS GmbH) of 30 cm2 and cathodes are made of 3D carbon felt (from Mersen, France) 
of 30 cm2. Two peristatic pumps FH100 were used to control the flow throughout the r eactor 
at flow rates of 20.4, 42.5, 85 .0, 127.5 and 170 .0 mL min-1. Air supply was provided by a fine 
bubble diffuser (Fig. 40 ) and controlled by an air flowmeter. To assess the influence of the  
airflow, two airflows were tested (0.2 and 0.6 L min-1) without changing the other operating 
conditions. The results were very similar for oxidative degradati on of HCT and for the 
mineralization of its solution. Thus, it was decided to work with airflow of 0.2 L min-1 in all 
experiments. The solutions to be degraded contain 0.1 mM of HCT, 50 mM of Na 2SO 4 and the 
pH is adjusted to 3 with 1 M of sulfuric acid. A constant current wa s delivered by a Microlab 
power supply to the electrodes mounted in parallel.  
   178 where TOC 0 is the the TOC at the beginning of the experiment and TOC f, the TOC at steady 
state. For both mineralization and degradation, the quasi steady sta te was reached after 3 
residence times (A nnex Fig. 1). The modelling of the kinetic was performed by the softw are 
Aquasim® (Reichert 1998) .  
 
2.4. Mineralization c urrent efficiency (MCE) and e nerg y consumption (EC)  
The EC was determined to evaluate the operating cost of the process.  The EC formula (Bril las 
et al. 2009) was modified to fit the continuous mode is given in Eq. 36. 
#"(abℎ/efg")	=E∗<
,-./^	–	-./`3∗h∗6i00       (36) 
with E, the cell voltage (V), I the current (A) and D the flow rate in L  s-1.  
The MCE was used to estimate the efficiency of the reactor i n the treatment of the HCT solution . 
The MCE usual formula (Brillas et al. 2009) was modified in order  to be consistent with the 
continuous mode (Eq. 37 ).  
														!"#(%)=	)	*		,-./^01-./`3

where m is the number of carbon atoms of HCT (7), M is the molar mass of the carbon (12 000 
mg mol-1) and n is the number of electrons used to mineralize one molecule of HCT following 
the Eq. 38 assuming that N atoms of HCT were mainly converted to NH 4+.

2.5. Design of experiments (DOE) 
To have an empirical overview of the influence of selected operating  parameters on the 
degradation, the mineralization, the EC and the MCE during the EF and the AO treatments, the 
Doehlert experimental design was applied. This method requires the s election of input  179 parameters of interest. The liquid flow rate was chosen as it  is an important parameter for 
continuous process, since it governs the hydraulic retention time in the reactor. The current and 
the catalyst (Fe2+) concentration were added as they are key parameters in electr ochemical 
processes. The Doehlert matrix for three parameters consists  of 13 experiments. For each 
parameter (Ui), different values were tested according to the Doehlert matrix (Table 12 ) 
between a maximum and a minimum level chosen according to lab scale  studies. Table 13 gives 
the minimum and maximum level for each parameter and its coded va lue (Xi) according to the 
following equation ( Eq. 39).  
														kU	=	?lm	1lm0

with Ui 0, the central value for Ui, ΔUi, the gap between the highest and the lowest value for 
Ui and αi, equal to 1, √6
7 and √i
6 for α1, α2 and α3 respectively.

+ b 13X1X3 + b 23X2X3 (40) 
with b i and b ii the coefficients of the model. The software Nemrod® was used to  estimate the 
different coefficients. 
 
2.6. Retention t ime distribution (RTD) 
RTD experiments were performed by the tracer method (Viva and B runazzi 2009). When the 
reactor was entirely filled and the flow stable, a salt t racer (6 mL of 233 g L-1 of KCl) was 
injected at the entrance of the reactor by a syringe of 10 mL. The  conductivity of the tracer 
leaving the reactor was measured. After each acquisition the rea ctor was emptied and ultrapure 
water was used to clean it.  
The theoretical residence time ( τ) is defined thanks to the volume of the reactor and the flow 
rate (Eq. 41) and represents the theoretical mean time to flow through the r eactor.  
τ = V/Q            (41) 
with τ in min, V the volume of the reactor (mL) and Q the flow rate (mL min-1). 
To model the RTD functions a dimensionless time is convenient; it is  defined by the time 
divided by the theoretical retention time (Eq. 42 ).  
θ = t / τ           (42) 
with t, the tim e (min) and τ the theoretical residence time (min ). 
The residence time distribution function (E) gives the age distribut ion frequency of fluid 
elements leaving the reactor (Eq. 43 ).  
E(θ) = C(θ)/C 0          (43) 
with θ, the dimensionless time, C( θ), the tracer concentration at the exit of the reactor at tim e θ 
and C0, the tracer concentration obtained if all the injected mass was  diluted into the volume of 
the reactor (1.7 L). C 0 (concentration of the tracer) is equal to 1.1 * 10-2 M. Thanks to the shape  182 of the RTD curves the reactor modelling can be identified. The mea n residence time is then 
obtained thanks to the following equation (Eq. 44 ). 
														fp=∫r	E(r)srt

∫	E(r)srt
^          (44 )  
  
2.7. Mathematical tools  
To compare the model results with experimental measurements the index of agreement (IOA) 
(Eq. 45) was used (Mousset et al. 2016; Trellu et al. 2016b). 
													IoA=1−	∑(yz1{z)| }

where K is the number of observed values, Ém is a numerically simulated value, [m is the 
corresponding experimentally observed value, Éj is the average of the numerically simulated 
values. 
The correlation coefficient was calculated by Eq. 46 .  
R = ∑[(ÑU−ÑÖK
mÜ9)∗(ÉU−ÉÖ)]	/	(á(∑[(ÑU−ÑÖK
mÜ9)^2]∗á∑[(ÉU−ÉÖK

with R, the correlation coefficient, xi, an experimental point, xm, the mean of the experimental 
points, yi, a theoretical point, ym, the mean of the theoretical point s and P the number of points .  
 
3. Results and discussion  
 
3.1. Influence of operating parameters and configuration on the r eactor 
efficiencies    183 To identify the relative influence of different operating parameter s on the degradation of HCT 
and mineralization of its solution, and therefore on the MCE and E C, a DOE method was 
applied. Three parameters were considered: i) the current density,  ii) the flow rate and iii) the 
catalyst (Fe2+) concentration. The 14-electrode configuration was used in this pa rt. The thirteen 
different experiments and their results are detailed in Table 14 . With  regard to the oxidative 
degradation of HCT, a complete degradation was observed for several condi tions and thus the 
model could not be applied. However, it was evidenced that the curre nt was by far the most 
important parameter for the degradation efficiency of the reactor.  This is in accordance with 
batch experiments (Ello uze et al. 2017) . Additionally, other experiments have been performed 
in order to compare two reactor configurations.

coefficients estimated are given in Fig. 41a . A correlation coefficient of 0.972 and an adjusted 
one of 0.9 were obtained with these coefficients values thanks to Ne mrod® software .

In the range of operating parameters selected, from the coeffic ient values obtained it appears 
that the most important parameter was the flow rate (X 2) followed by the current ( |ä7|>|ä9|>
|ä6|). The catalyst concentration appears to have much less influence on t he mineralization than 
the two other operational parameters. This suggests that AO is the main process influencing 
mineralization. Although EF is generally more efficient than AO  for degradation, the 
mineralization efficiency differs little (Guinea et al. 2010; Feng et al. 2014). This point will be 
discussed deeply in a next sub-section. 
The positive sign of b 1 and b 3 means that the mineralization rate will increase by increasi ng the 
catalyst concentration and the current. This fact was expected a s by increasing the current more 
hydroxyl radicals are formed and the increase in catalyst concentrat ion (in a certain range) 
promotes the Fenton reaction. The minus sign of the coefficien t b2 means that to increase the 
mineralization rate, the flow rate has to be reduced; this is due to the longer tre atment time 
inside the reactor . The important absolute value of coefficient b 12 means that the current and 
the flow rate are connected and govern mainly the efficiency of t he mineralization process. The 
minus sign indicates that those two parameters work in the opposite wa y, one brings a positive 
effect while the other plays a negative effect on the minerali zation. This is consistent with the 
sign of the coefficient b 1 and b 2 which are opposite. Thus, for a better mineralization rate, the 
current should increase and the flow rate decrease. This behavior wa s verified by analyzing the 
results of run 4 to 8 (Annex Table 1 ). It can  be observed that the higher is the flow rate, the 
lower is the mineralization. This result can be explained by the l ower contact time of the 
solution with hydroxyl radicals. The effect of the current was als o verified with run 9-11 (Annex  186 Table 1) since an increase of the current from 10 to 22 mA cm-2 leads to an increase of the 
mineralization rate from 50% to 76%.  
Thanks to the polynomial function Y, it is possible to predict the mine ralization rates in the area 
defined by the upper and lower values of each parameter. Indeed, by repla cing all the coded 
values: X 1 (current), X 2 (flow rate) and X 3 (Fe2+ concentration) in Eq. 46, the mineralization 
rate (Y) can be estimated. This can be illustrated by contour plots. Fig. 41b illustrates the flow 
rate versus the current at a given catalyst concentration at the center of its range (X 3=0). For 
instance, the line blue 40 corresponds to the “iso-mineralization ra te” of 40% representing all 
the conditions of flow rates and currents where the mineralization rate is of 40% at a def ined 
Fe2+ concentration of 0.13 mM.  
Fig. 42 illustrates the contour plots for MCE and EC. In Fig. 42a  and Fig. 42b, one isocurve 
represents all the conditions of flow rates and currents at Fe2+  concentration of 0.13 mM where 
the EC and the MCE have respectively a defined value.

For both MCE and EC, the current is the most important operating pa rameter (|ä9|>|ä7|) as 
illustrated in Fig.42 where the iso-curves are parallels to the  flow rate axis. Here also the catalyst

3.2 18.433.3b a  188 concentration has nearly no impact. The lower is the current, the hi gher is the MCE and the 
lower is the EC. This opposite influence of the high currents can be e xplained by scavenging 
reactions that occur at higher current intensity, for example wate r oxidation at the anode and 
H2 evolution at the cathode (Zhang et al. 2007). Finally, a compromise between a high 
degradation and an acceptable EC and MCE has to be chosen. In other term s, a good balance 
for the current and flow rate is required. 
Finally, this process is really advantageous compared to more conventi onal processes because 
of its high mineralization power allowing high mineralization rate. For example, 97% of the 
initial TOC value could be removed under 47.6 mA cm-2 current, flow rate of 20.4 mL min-1, 
0.2 L min-1 of air flow rate and 50 mM of Na2SO 4. This process is much more efficient than an 
activated sludge treatment were only 30% of HCT is in general eli minated in conventional 
wastewater treatment plants (Margot et al. 2015) . It seems  also to be more efficient than O 3 
treatment where only 80% of the solution is mineralized (Rosal and Agüera 2008). However, 
even if this process is very efficient compared to the conventiona l methods , some energy is 
wasted in side reactions as can be seen with the MCE values o f Fig. 42b. Thus a compromise 
should be reached between high efficiency and cost effective process. T herefore the 
combination of electro-Fenton with a biological treatment can const itute a promising option. 
The goal of such a coupling being to transform the non-biodegradable compounds i nto 
biodegradable species in a first stage by electro-Fenton, and then appl y a biodegradation step 
to reach high mineralization degrees.  
 
3.1.2. Influence of the configuration on the mineralization rat e and EC  
To deeper understand the interactions between reactor configuration and oper ational 
parameters, two configurations were tested: the first with 14  electrodes and a gap of 4 cm  189 between electrodes and the second with 28 electrodes and a distance of 2 cm between 
electrodes.  
Table 15: Influence of the configuration on the mineralizatio n rate at steady state. 0.1 
mM of HCT, 50 mM of Na 2SO 4 and 0.2 L.min-1 of air were used for all the 
experiments.

The mineralization of the solution was tested for both configurations  with different currents or 
with similar currents but different current densities. For the same total applied current, the 
mineralization is higher for the 28-electrode system (by comparing Run 1 and 2 of the Table 
15). This can be explained by the low extent of side reactions at l ow current densities, thus the 
applied current is less wasted in the system allowing better mine ralization rate. For the same 
current per cell, the mineralization is much higher with this 28 el ectrodes system (around 30% 
of increases by comparing Run 1 and 3). This confirms that the mos t important parameter is the 
contact time between the solution and the electrodes which was alre ady highlighted by the 
importance of the flow rate.  
The operating cost (EC) was also considered for both configurations. Fig. 43 depicts the results 
obtained. As can be seen from this figure, the 28-electrode configur ation is more cost effective 
as for the same current density per branch the EC is always higher for the 14-electrode 
configuration.  
  191 compared to other studies. Adding a cathode on the floor or sides of the  reactor directly linked 
to the air bubbling to promote H 2O2 production could constitute a solution to this issue.  
The role of the configuration is very important as it drastically i nfluences the mineralization 
rate and the cost of the proc ess. The comparison between the two configurations leads to the 
following statement: for both point of view, the 28-electrode configur ation is better, with 
shorter distance between the electrodes and higher active surface a rea.  
This part has demonstrated that the flow rate and the configuration play an important role on 
the EC and the mineralization rate. Thus, as they are closely associated to the path followed by 
the pollutants in the reactor, a deeper analysis of the hydrodynamics in the reactor was carried 
out. 
 
3.2. Hydrodynamics  
 
3.2.1. RTD curves  
RTD curves were drawn in order to identify the variation of fl ow pattern in the reactor 
and to choose the most suitable model to characterize the pilot. F ig. 44 shows the RTD curves 
obtained for the system containing 28 electrodes at different flow rat es. The equivalent chart 
for 14-electrode configuration is given in Annex Fig. 2. The parabolic shape of the curves shows 
that there is no by-pass or short-circuit in the reactor. One c an observe that the higher is the 
flow rate, the thinner is the peak and the smaller is the area of the peak. The lower slope at the 
end of the curves highlights the presence of stagnant zones (Haoran et al . 2013). For both 14- 
and 28-electrode configurations , it can be observed similar shapes. Thus, the same model is 
applied for both configurations, as described below.   192  
Fig. 44: RTD functions plotted against the time fo r different flow rates under 0.2 mL min-1 of air with 28 -
electrode configuration.   
 
The mean retention time ( fp) can be estimated as the time when half of the area of the c urve is 
reached. As the peaks are quite symmetric the mean retention tim es can be read on the curve at 
the top of each peak. Table 16 compares the theoretical retention t ime (τ) with the Ts for th e 
two configurations at different flow rates. The τ is higher than Ts, which is a characteristic 
phenomenon observed when dead volumes are present in the reactor. Furthermore , fp for 28-
electrode configuration is longer than fp for 14-electrode configuration because of additional 
troublemakers in the 28-electrode system that lengthen the flow path  inside the reactor (Annex 
Fig. 4) .

Because of the symmetric aspect of the curves and the presence of  dead volumes, the model of 
continuously stirred tank reactors in series with dead volumes was se lected and compared to 
the classical plug flow model. The CSTR model was also proposed as the vertical bubbling 
enable to realize an efficient mixing of the solution.  
 
3.2.2. Model 
In order to confirm this hypothesis, the experimental were compared to the CSTR in series 
model. The RTD (#(å)) for the CSTR model is given by the Eq. 47 .  
														#(å)=9

with m, the fraction of active volume, and N the number of continuously stirred tank reactors. 
When N approaches 1, the reactor is similar to a CSTR and when N approaches infinity, the 
model is approaching a plug flow. Both m and N were estimated thanks t o the Excel solver. In 
order to check the strength of the model, different initial parame ter (N and m) were taken and 
the correlation coefficient was calculated by Eq. 11 . All the correlation coefficients were over 
0.9928 (Table 18) which confirms the suitability for the model.  
This CSTR in series model was then compared to the plug flow model  describe by Eq. 48.  194  E(t) =  9

with Pe the Peclet number representing the proportion of convective flow  compared to diffusive 
flow. The plug flow model is known to be well representing a system when the Pe number is 
over 100. Both Ts and Pe were estimated thanks to Excel solver with  the RTD curves. The 
different parameters were calculated for the 28-electrode confi guration. fp, Pe and the 
correlation coefficient are given in Tab le 17 for all the flow rates.

The Pe numbers grow with higher flow rates, which mean that the fl ow is being more 
convective for higher flow rates. Meanwhile the Pe numbers are below  100 meaning that the 
plug flow model is not relevant, even more as the more accurate flow  rates are the lower ones. 
The correlation coefficient for the CSTR model (Table 18) are cl oser to 1 than for the plug flow 
model (Table 17 ) which is also in favor of the mixed tank reactors. Thus the CSTR m odel in 
series with dead volumes will be used to study the reactor (Annex Fi g. 3).

3.2.3. Experimental parameters (N and m) 
As flow rate is directly related to the RTD, the relation be tween this parameter and the number 
of CSTR as well as the fraction of active volume was studied in order to characterize the reactor 
for both configurations (Fig. 45 ).  
 
Fig. 45: Number of continuously stirred reactors in series (N) and fraction of active volume (m) plotted 
against the liquid flow rate, under 0.2 mL min-1 of air with 14 - and 28 -electrode configuratio ns. 
 
As shown in Fig. 45, for the 14-electrode system, the fraction of active volume is increasing 
with the liquid flow rate, being of 80% at 20.4 mL min-1 and of 92% at 128 mL min-1. In the 
reactor the mixing and the shear rate are due to: (i) the flow rate in the reactor and the contact 791214

Number of CSTR 14 elec Number of CSTR 28 elec Active volume 14 elec Active volume 28 elec 196 with the obstacles (electrodes) and (ii) the air flow of small  bubbles from the air diffuser. Thus 
by increasing the liquid flow rates, the liquid velocity is increa sing and the turbulence around 
the electrodes is also increasing leading to a better mixing and thus  to lower dead zones and 
stagnant zones in the reactor at high flow rate. Higher liquid flow  rate enhances the mixing 
between active and dead zones resulting in the activation of a portion of  the volume of the 
stagnant zone (Saravanathamizhan et al. 2008; Djoudi et al. 2012). For t he 28-electrode system, 
the fraction of active volume is nearly the same for all the f low rates and is higher than that 
obtained for the 14-electrode system. The difference between the two  configurations can be 
explained by the larger number of electrodes which increases the tur bulence in the reactor 
leading to a lower dead volume (Djoudi et al. 2012). However, at the hi ghest flow rate (127.5 
mL min-1), the fraction of active volume is the same for both configurations  due to the high 
velocity promoting a better mixing in the reactor.   
The number of CSTR in series increases with the liquid flow rate  for both configurations (Fig 
45). At low flow rate, the reactor approaches a few continuously sti rred tank reactors behavior 
and by increasing the flow rate it tends to a plug flow reactor (Yuan et al. 2004; Furman et al. 
2005; Saravanathamizhan et al. 2008; Xiao-chang et al. 2008; Djoudi et al . 2012) . The slope 
inflection at high flow rate highlights that the effect of the incr ease in the flow rate on the 
number of CSTR is lower in these conditions. The number of CSTR in series is higher for the 
configuration with 28-electrode configuration than for the configuration wi th 14 electrodes, 
whatever the liquid flow rate. This means that by increasing the number of electrodes, the 
hydrodynamic behavior tends more towards a plug flow reactor. This observa tion is logical 
since by increasing the number of electrodes, the number of “reactor s perfectly mixed” is 
increased due to more complex water flow provided by the series of ba ffles (electrodes) under 
which the wastewater is forced to flow.   197 Another parameter, the air flow rate, was tested since it i s an important characteristic of the 
hydrodynamics of the pilot. Two flow rates were chosen: 0.2 and 1 L min-1 and the number of 
CSTR in series and the fraction of active volume were considered ( Fig.46 ). The increase of the 
aeration rate decreases the number of CSTR  being of 4, 6, 9 and 11 reactors for 20.4, 42.5, 85 
and 127.5 mL min-1, respectively. The lower number of reactors is due to a better mixing 
produced by the aeration which makes the system tend toward the CSTR model.  
 
Fig. 46: Number of continuously stirred reactors in series (N) plotted against the liquid flow rate, under 
0.2 L min-1 and 1 L min-1 of air with 14 electrodes . 
 
Concerning the fraction of active volume ( Fig. 4 7), no real difference was observed between 
0.2 L min-1 and 1 L min-1. Higher air flow rates were tested (5 and 8 L min-1) but the introduction 
of high air flow lead to high gas retention that decreased the liquid volum e in the reactor. This 
volume could not be estimated properly due to the high gas retention in the r eactor and therefore 
these results were not considered. This parameter still need t o be optimized since it could 
significantly affect the production of H 2O2. A compromise should be found: a too low air flow 
rate will lead to a poor efficiency of the electro-Fenton w hereas a too high flow rate could lead 
to high gas retention which is likely to increase the electrical  resistance of the solution. 0246810121416

considered constant, as observed experimentally (Mousset et al. 2019a) .  
Two different behaviors can be observed depending on whether the reaction i s limited by mass 
transport or charge transfer reaction. The limiting current densi ty (J lim) has to be calculated 
according to Eq. 49 and compared to the applied current density (J app) in order to know in which 
regime the reactor is operating (Eq. 50 ).

where n is the number of electrons to mineralize the pollutant (Eq.  38), F is the Faraday constant 
equal to 96500 C mol-1, K is an overall mass transfer coefficient (m s-1), C is the concentration 
of carbon (mmol L-1), I is the current (A), A is the anode surface (m2) and J the current density 
in A m-2.  
When J app < Jlim, the system is controlled by the current and when J lim > Japp then the system is 
operating under mass transfer control. The expression of the anodic oxida tion rate r ao is given 
by the Eqs. 51 and 52 (Panizza et al. 2001; Michaud 2002; Lan et al. 2018; Mousset et al. 
2019a). 
 If Japp < Jlim then, r ao = KAC0/V       (51) 
 If J app > Jlim, then r ao = KAC/V        (52) 
where C0 is the initial concentration of carbon (0.7 mM), V is the volume  of the reactors (m3) 
and r ao in mmol L-1 s-1. For the pilot J app is equal to 166 A m-2 (0.5/0.003) for each CSTR. As K 
is gathering all the transfer system it is strongly linked to the f low rate. Thus values of K were 
estimated using the software Aquasim® (Annex Table 2) for all the different flow rates. These 
values are in the same order of magnitude (10-5) which is a common value. For all the flow 
rates, Japp > J lim, so it can be assumed that the pilot is operating under mass transpor t control 
(Eq. 52).  Mass balance can be written assuming that only an AO is occurring (Eq. 53 ).   201 Table 19: IOA for different flow rates

 The model was drawn and the value of the concentration for each CST R was calculated in the 
steady state. The model was then challenged to the experimental points and the results are give n 
in Fig. 49. The experimental values and the model are following the s ame trend. In order to 
validate the model, the IOA was calculated. The different values are given in Tab le 19.   
All the IOA values are higher than 0.984. Thus, the model is able to de scribe the degradation 
for different positions in the reactor at steady state. By the us e of a numerical model, more 
complex kinetic models could be implemented. Thanks to this model (3. 4.1.) it is possible to 
optimize an “electrochemical plug flow” reactor having the higher m ineralization rate with the 
smaller mean retention time. As an example more than 90 % of the  solution is mineralized with 
the 20.4 mL min-1 flow rate thus using a lower flow rate (mean residence time)  will consume 
more energy for nearly the same result. For a different approach,  when only a certain part of 
the solution needs to be mineralized (for a combined treatment for instance) then thanks to this 
model, the flow rate and hydrodynamic can be estimated to minimize the energy consumption. 
The operating cost can also be decreased by tempting to apply a differe nt J app in all the 
“perfectly mixed reactors” close to J lim to maximize the MCE. This is possible by controlling 
the current (J app) or to fix aeration, flow rates, configurations to adjust it to J lim. To a larger 
extent this study can enable to design reactors and optimize their per formances .   202

points a t 20.4 and 42.5 mL min-1ş respectively. The + and _ symbols represent flow rates of 85.0 and

However, this model has some limitations: i) the model used is a first stage analyze and does 
not reflect all the reactions occurring in the solution ( see section 3.4.1), ii) the aeration may 
have a role to play in the hydrodynamics of the reactor but this aspe ct is not taken into account, 
iii) only the steady state is considered as the calculations could be simplified but an overall 
understanding of the process may be interesting.

Number of the CSTR 203 4. Conclusion  
In this study, a DOE was first carried out in order to find the m ore important parameters 
regarding the mineralization rate, the MCE and the EC for minera lization of HCT aqueous 
solution. It was shown that the flow rate was more impacting on the mineralization rate whereas 
the current was more important for the EC and the MCE. The lower was the flow rate, the 
higher was the mineralization rate due to the longer treatment ti me. Some deeper experiments 
were then carried out to evidence the effect of the reactor confi guration on the mineralization 
efficiency and the operating cost. The 28-electrode configuration wa s found to be better than 
the 14-electrode configuration, the former promoting the mixing with mor e troublemakers and 
having a longer flow path.   
To better understand the important role of the flow rate and the confi guration , an hydrodynamic 
study was performed. RTD curves were obtained and compared to the CSTR in series with dead 
zones and to the plug flow models. These CSTRs suited better with the  RTD curves thus, this 
model was chosen to model the reactor. With this model, the number  of CSTR, the active 
volume and the mean retention time were studied for different flow rates and configurations. 
The hydrodynamic study confirms the DOE: the 28- electro de configuration had a lower dead 
volume thanks to the better mixing and a lower EC. Low flow rate s approached a perfectly 
mixed tank reactor with high mean residence time.   
Finally, a mathematical model for the mineralization of HCT sol ution was established, 
combining a pseudo first order kinetic of mineralization with the hydrodyna mic model. This 
model was compared to experimental points and a good IOA was calculat ed demonstrating the 
good suitability of this model.  
This is the first time that a model was developed combining both hydrodyna mics and kinetic to 
describe an electrochemical pilot. This study enables to predict for  this type of reactor the % of  204 mineralization for the more accurate mean residence time and t he best electrode configurations. 
Several applications of this model can be offered: having the best % o f mineralization but also 
in order to perform a combined treatment, to find the best conditions to reach a given % of 
mineralization (length of the reactor, configuration, flow rate, c urrent) at the lowest cost. 
Eventually, to a larger extent, the mathematical model can be i mplemented in order to consider 
the mediated oxidation, the role of the aeration, etc. to perfectl y model the pilot and control the 
process p aving the way for the scale-up of the treatment .

   210    211 1. Introduction  
In our today’s life pharmaceuticals are highly consumed especially to treat diseases or to 
prevent them. Once being used, they enter the environment mostly by huma n and animal 
excretion and discharge of polluted effluents coming from pharmaceutica l industries, domestic 
and hospital effluents (Duong et al. 2008; Kümmerer 2009b). Their occurre nce in the 
environment is due to the lack of efficiency of the existing treat ment in wastewater treatment 
plant (WWTP) mostly based on a biological elimination (Stackelberg et al. 2007) .  
Several treatment techniques are used to eliminate the organic m icro-pollutants; some of them 
are based on the transfer of the pollutant from one phase to another one l ike physico-chemicals 
techniques such as adsorption (Rivera-utrilla et al. 2013) and membrane  technologies (Göbel 
et al. 2007). Others are directly eliminating the pharmaceutic al such as advanced oxidation 
processes (AOPs) (Klavarioti et al. 2009; Oturan and Aaron 2014). AOPs are based on the 
formation of strong oxidants such as hydroxyl radicals, the second stronges t oxidant after 
fluorine, able to eliminate nearly any type of organic molecules (Brillas et al. 2009; Sirés and 
Brillas 2012). Among the AOPs, electrochemical advanced oxidation proc esses such as electro-
Fenton (EF) or anodic oxidation (AO) are commonly used as they are i) very efficient to remove 
organic pollutants from water, ii) environmentally friendly and iii ) easy to set up (Panizza and 
Cerisola 2001; Brillas et al. 2009; Sirés et al. 2014; Olvera-Va rgas et al. 2018) . For these 
treatments, the operating conditions and the nature of the anode are impor tant parameters that 
significantly influence the efficiency of the treatment. Among anodes,  boron doped diamond 
(BDD) and platine (Pt) are often used. BDD is used because of i ) its high oxidation efficiency, 
ii) its high current efficiency and iii) its long lifetime (Ac tis et al. 2008; Brillas et al. 2009; Wei 
et al. 2011; Oturan et al. 2012; Sopaj et al. 2016) . Comparatively, Pt is less efficient as its 
oxidation power is lower compared to BDD (Panizza and Cerisola 2005; R odrigo et al. 2010) .  212 BDD mineralizes quickly the organics without enabling the formation of  a lot of intermediates 
whereas the Pt enables to accumulate intermediates such as car boxylic acids (CAs).  
One of the most important drawback of EAOPs is the relatively high operating cost in the case 
of long treatment times. To overcome this disadvantage, the combina tion of an EAOP and a 
biological treatment to decrease the operating costs while keeping a  good mineralization rate 
has been proposed (Ganzenko et al. 2017; Monteil et al. 2018). Two differe nt treatment modes 
can then be employed, weather beginning by the biological treatment when t he effluents contain 
high concentration of biodegradable products or starting with the EAOP when t he solution is 
not biodegradable (Oller et al. 2011; Ganzenko et al. 2014; Olvera-Vargas  et al. 2016a; Monteil 
et al. 2018) . Some studies investigated the effect of such a combined treatment on the 
elimination of pharmaceuticals at lab scale and highlighted that this  combination can be very 
effective (Ferrag -Siagh et al. 2013; Ferrag-Siagh et al. 2014; Mansour et al. 2014; Ma nsour et 
al. 2015a; Mansour et al. 2015b; Olvera-Vargas et al. 2016a; Olvera-Va rgas et al. 2016b; 
Ganzenko et al. 2017; Roshini et al. 2017; Zaghdoudi et al. 2017; Aboudalle et  al. 2018) . 
However, a key step in the process control of this type of coupling is to better understand how 
the operating conditions applied on the EAOP will influence the effici ency of the biological 
treatment.  
In this context, this chapter aims at trying to explain why some conditions are more interesting 
based on the nature of the anode (BDD or Pt) and on the impact of the pa rent pollutants and the 
by-products. The diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) was chosen as the m odel pollutant for 
this study as i) it is hardly eliminated by wastewater treatme nt plants (Margot et al. 2015) , ii) it 
was found in surface water (Bouissou-Schurtz et al. 2014) and iii) it is toxic to the environment 
(Fernández et al. 2010). The EF and AO treatments of this compound w ith a pilot scale reactor 
were investigated in a previous chapter (Chapter 3). The first par t of this chapter will focus on 
the interest of performing a combined process showing the inadequacy of a biological treatment  213 alone and the possibility to decrease the operating costs. Some spec ific conditions are required 
to efficiently perform this combined treatment. The second part deal s with identifying them. 
Finally, the third part uses the specific conditions found previously to obt ain a good 
mineralization rate. 
 
2. Material and methods  
 
2.1. Chemicals 
All chemicals used in this study were analytical grade and used as received without further 
purification. The pharmaceutical HCT (C 7H8ClN 3O4S2, purity > 99%) was supplied by Sigma 
Aldrich. Iron (II) sulfate heptahydrate (catalyst source, 99%) wa s purchased from Acros 
Organics. Sodium sulfate (Na 2SO 4) (supporting electrolyte) was supplied from Sigma-Aldrich. 
MgSO 4 (Chimie-Plus Laboratoire), Cacl 2 2H 2O (Merck), FeCl 3 (Sigma Aldrich), NH 4Cl 
(Merck), Na 2HPO 4 (Acros), K 2HPO 4 (VWR) and KH 2PO 4 (Acros) were used as nutrients or 
buffer for the biological treatment. Short-chain CAs (oxalic, oxa mic, acetic and maleic acids 
were obtained from Acros, Fluka and Alfa Aesar. Solutions were pre pared with osmosis water 
equipment purchased from Cloup which keeps conductivity below 20 µS cm-1. The pH of 
solutions was adjusted using analytical grade sulfuric acid (Acros) and sodium hydroxide 
(Fluka). Organic solvents used were HPLC or analytic grade from Si gma-Aldrich, Fluka and 
Merck. 
 
2.2. Electrochemical treatment  
HCT solutions were prepared at different concentrations in 50 mM of s odium sulfate (as 
electrolyte) and the solution pH is adjusted to 3.0 by a CyberScan 1500 from Eutech 
Instruments and a 1 M H 2SO 4 solution. In the case of the AO oxidation the solutions were left  214 as stated above for the EF treatment, 0.1 mM of ferrous iron wa s added to the solution, a usual 
concentration for the EF degradation.  
 
2.2.1. Batch treatment  
The different batch experiments were performed in an open undivided  cylindrical cell of 250 
mL. The electrochemical cell was composed of whether a BDD o r Pt anode and a carbon felt 
cathode. The anodes had around 30 cm2 surface area. BDD was purchased from COND IAS 
GmbH in Germany. The cathode was a 3D structure measuring 18 * 5.0 * 0.5 cm3; it was placed 
on the inner wall of the cell covering the total internal perimet er. It  was purchased from Mersen 
(France). The solutions were stirred with a magnetic bar. The de gradation and the 
mineralization of the synthetic effluent were performed under current -controlled conditions 
using a Hameg HM8040 triple power DC supply. Continuous saturation of O 2 was ensured by 
bubbling air starting 10 min before starting the electrolysis.  
 
2.2.2. Treatment with electrochemical pilot  
The electrochemical pilot is made of plexiglass and has a capac ity of 1.7 L (Fig. 50). The reactor 
is composed of 14 anodes and 14 cathodes separated by 2 cm. Anodes are made of  BDD film 
on niobium support (from CONDIAS GmbH) of 30 cm2 and cathodes are made of 3D carbon 
felt of 30 cm2 (from Mersen). Two peristatic pumps FH100  drive the flow throughout the 
reactor. Aeration was set at 0.2 L min-1 provided from the whole surface of the bottom of the 
reactor and is adjusted by an air flowmeter. A constant current wa s delivered by a Microlab 
power supply  to the electrodes mounted in parallel.   215  
 
Fig. 50: The pilot reactor of 1.7 L and the whole set up . 
 
2.3. Biological treatment  
Three inoculums were used for the biodegradation assays. The first one was taken from an 
activated sludge reactor from the WWTP from Jablines. The second inoculum was taken from 
the mixed liquor of an aerobic biofilter from the WWTP Saint-Thi bault des Vignes (named 
biofilters). The last inoculum used was a sample of µ-organisms already acclimated to the 
pollutant and to the CAs from a previous treatment (named selected µ-organisms). The µ-
organisms were centrifuged, washed with tap water and then added to a  new solution.  
The initial volatile suspended solid (VSS) concentration was measure d for every sample and a 
dilution factor was calculated to reach an initial concentrat ion of VSS of 0.01 gVSS L-1 for each 
 216 biodegradation test. This low value was chosen to avoid TOC measure dis ruption with soluble 
organic matter coming from biomass.  
The biodegradation tests were performed in an erlenmeyer flask of 500 m L closed with cotton 
to enable gas exchange but prevent contamination. The biological reactor  was operated as 
follows: pH adjustment with 1 M Na 2SO 4 and 1 M NaOH to keep the pH in the range 6.5-7.5; 
mechanical stirring using a rotative plate at 122 RPM (revolution per minute) provided by 
Merck and room temperature (22 ± 3) °C. Different nutrients compositions were tested 
especially with different N concentrations (5 to 20 mg L-1) and no effect was observed between 
experiments, meaning that nutrients were not limiting. From these observations the following 
concentrations were applied: 18.75 mg L-1 of NH 4Cl (corresponding to 5 mg L-1 N-NH 4), 36.5 
mg L-1 of Cacl 2 2 H 2O, 0.26 mg L-1 FeCl 3 6 H 2O and 11 mg L-1 of MgSO 4. The phosphate buffer 
used was composed of 334 mg L-1 of Na 2HPO 4, 85 mg L-1 of KH 2PO 4 and 208 mg L-1 of 
K2HPO 4 (Rodier et al. 2009) .  
Experiments with and without external addition of air were also per formed and no difference 
was observed since oxygen was in excess, thus no external aeration was applied. The effect of 
the addition of sodium sulfite to eliminate the residual hydrogen peroxide was tested on the 
bacteria and no effect was found thus 5 mL of a 0.5 M sodium sulfite solution was added for 
all the biodegradation tests.  
A bio-adsorption study was carried out to confirm that the degradation  was due to a real 
elimination and not to the transfer of the pollutant to another phase.  After 5 min, 1 h, 2 h and 6 
h samples were taken of the HCT mixed with the bacteria and its concentration remained 
constant, meaning that adsorption was negligible.  
   217 2.4. Analytical methods  
Before each analytical measure the solution was filtered through a 0.2 µm filter made of PTFE 
(polytetrafluoroethylene). When error bars are given on the graphs, t hey are calculated based 
on the standard deviation of the different experiments. 
 
2.4.1. HPLC analysis 
HCT and its aromatic degradation intermediates were followed and  measured by using an 
uHPLC equipped with a Hypersil Gold column (100 mm * 2.1 mm), 1.9  µ and coupled with a 
diode array detector (DAD). The temperature of the column was  set at 40°C. The injection 
volumes were of 5 µL. The mobile phase was composed of water/methanol (95:5) both 
containing 1% of acetic acid at 0.08 mL min-1. The wavelength of detection was set at 270 nm.  
Oxamic, maleic, acetic and oxalic acids were identified a nd quantified by a Merck Lachrom 
Liquid chromatograph equipped with a Bio-Rad Aminex 5 µ m, 25 cm × 4.6 mm (i.d.) column 
and coupled with a DAD. The mobile phase was H 2SO 4 at 4 mM at a flowrate of 0.6 mL min-
1. The detector was set at 220 nm. A calibration curve was per formed for each detected acid. 
Experiments were carried out using a total concentration of CAs of  250 mg C L-1 with 6.5, 3.35, 
0.075 and 0.075 mM of oxalic, oxamic, maleic and acetic acid respectively (concentrations are 
proportional to the one of chapter 2). 
 
2.4.2. TOC analysis 
The mineralization of the solution was followed by measuring  the t otal organic carbon (TOC) 
of treated solutions using a Shimadzu VCSH TOC analyzer. 2 drops of 1 M  H2SO 4 were added 
to each sample of 5 mL to acidify the solution in order to el iminate mineral carbon such as  218 carbonates. Reproducible values with ± 2% accuracy were detected. T he injection volumes 
were of 50 µL.  
 
2.4.3. Liquid chromatography (LC) – mass spectroscopy (MS) anal ysis 
LC-MS analyses were performed to identify Aromatic intermedia tes (AIs) formed during the 
AO treatment of the HCT. The same Hypersil Gold column at 40°C and a liquid flowrate of 0.2 
mL min-1 were used. After extracting from the treated solution with ethyl  acetate, the sample 
was completely dried under vacuum. Then it was diluted in 1 mL of metha nol / water 50/50 
(v/v) and eluted by 0.1% formic acid / methanol 90/10 (v/v) solution. Conce rning the mass 
conditions, the ESI (electrospray ionization) mode was used at 90 V.  
 
3. Results and discussion  
 
3.1. Interests of combining EAOPs and a biological treatment 
To analyze the interest of combining AO or EF with a biological tr eatment, each treatment was 
first studied alone.  
 
3.1.1. Inefficiency of a biological treatment alone in the c ase of persistent organics  
An experiment was carried out in batch reactor to assess t he ability of µ-organisms to eliminate 
the HCT without pre-treatment using an EAOP. Fig. 51 shows the c oncentration dynamics of 
HCT during one month in the biological reactor. The HCT concentration  remained stable, 
highlighting the inability of the µ-organisms from WWTP to eliminate HCT despite the great 
microbial diversity of the inoculum. This result is in agreement w ith the low mean percentage  219 of elimination of this molecule (30%) in wastewater treatment pl ants in Europe and United 
States (Margot et al. 2015) .

3.1.2. AO to mineralize a HCT solution 
The mineralization of 0.1 mM HCT solution was performed in the pilot -scale reactor by AO in 
the continuous mode. Results of the mineralization rate for differ ent currents are given in Fig. 
52. As already studied in chapter 3, it was possible to observe that the mineralization rate at the 
pilot output depends on the operating conditions and can reach high mineralizat ion rates. 00.020.040.060.080.10.12

min in the pilot reactor of Fig. 50. 
 
3.1.3. Electro-chemical pre-treatment followed by a biological p ost-treatment  
Biological treatment alone appeared inefficient whereas AO is  really efficient but with an EC 
that increases with treatment time (chapter 2). In order to get a cost effective treatment, the 
feasibility of the combination of an EAOP and biological treatment  was assessed. To evaluate 
the cost of the energy saved, the price (P) for the treatment of 1 m3 of 0.1 mM HCT solution in 
the pilot reactor was estimated according to the Eq. 56 .  
P = U * I * 10-3 * h * 0.1461         (56)  
with P in euros, U the voltage (in Volt), I the current (in Ampe re), h, the time of treatment (in 
h) and 0.1461 the mean price of the French kWh in 2019 in euro.  
The cost of electrical energy obtained for different mineralizat ion rates are given in Fig. 53. For 
a similar flow rate, by reducing the mineralization from 76 t o 60% and from 76 to 50%, the 
electrical cost could be divided by 1.5 and 3 respectively. To reach the same mineralization rate 506076

of the 0.1 mM HCT solution, respectively.  
 
Some combined treatments were then performed in order to assess the  efficiency of such system 
by varying the operational conditions. For most of them the biomass was not able to mineralize 
the electrochemically pre-treated solution. However, for one operat ional condition some 
information could be extracted. In this study, a solution of 0.84 mM o f HCT (62 mgC L-1) was 
treated by AO in the pilot at a flow rate of 20.4 mL min-1 (with mean residence time of 82 min) 
under 24 mA cm-2 constant current density and effluents were collected after 15 ( A), 30 (B), 45 
(C) and 120 (D) min. A biological batch experiment was then performe d with 0.01 gVSS L-1 
of activated sludge mixed with 250 mL of the treated solutions. Aft er the electrochemical pre-
treatment, HCT was totally degraded for all conditions except for the condition A where 27% 
of HCT was still remaining in the solution. The results of the  combined treatment concerning 
the total mineralization rate are given in Fig. 54.  1.442.734.32

Whatever the experimental conditions, only a small part was minera lized by the biological 
treatment: respectively 9, 7, 7 and 2% for conditions A, B, C and D. These results highlight that 
the solutions are certainly composed by molecules very low biodegradable e ven by an inoculum 
with a large microbial diversity. This was confirmed by an analys is of the more concentrated 
intermediates during the biological treatment. Indeed, thanks to the uHP LC analysis, the peak 
area of these AIs was found to remain stable highlighting their non- biodegradability by the µ-
organisms. Then, by using LC-MS analysis, their structure were found  and confirmed that these 
molecules were  still containing aromatic groups difficult ly degraded by µ-organisms (Table 
20). Thus, the biodegradable fraction is certainly composed by smaller  molecules and especially 
CAs, known to be biodegradable (Ganzenko et al. 2017). For condition D, the low 
biodegradation rate could also be linked to the very low carbon concentrati on remaining in the 
solution after the electrochemical treatment (5 mgC L-1), organic carbon certainly becoming 
limiting for the µ-organisms.  43%52%68%74%82%88%92% 94%

the AO treatment cannot lead to an efficient biological degradation pr obably due to the presence 
of AIs. Thus, next section will focus on finding the best operating conditions to provide 
biodegradable compounds and eliminate the non-biodegradable species.

the AO treatment of HCT 
 
3.2.1. Can the CAs formed during the AO be mineralized by biological treatment?   
Four CAs were formed during the degradation of HCT in batch reactor a ccording to a previous 
study of our group (Monteil et al. 2019 and chapter 2 of this work). Based on this observation, 
these 4 molecules were chosen as model of CAs and their relative concentrations were kept as 
already detected (Table 21 ).

experiments 1, 2 and 3 (Fig. 55), the inoculums were respectively a ctivated sludge, biofilters 
and selected µ-organisms.

According to Fig. 55 , all the CAs were successfully mineralized for all the inocul um by the 
biological treatments after a lag phase. The TOC was measure d at the end of the experiments; 
with a value closed to 0 for all the experiments highlighting a tot al mineralization of the CAs. 
For all the experiments, the CAs were sequentially degraded in the same order: first the maleic 
acid, then the acetic acid followed by the oxalic acid and finally t he oxamic acid. The maleic 
acid is certainly transformed into smaller molecules thus, t his molecule may not be mineralized 
first. Concerning the difference between the oxamic and the oxalic,  it can be supposed that it is 
due to the amine function. The degradation rate was almost zero f or the oxamic, oxalic and 00.20.40.60.81

Time (days)ca  226 maleic acid during their lag phase. The degradation rate using the tre atment with activated 
sludge biomass as inoculum was quicker than the mixed liquor from the biof ilters but slower 
than the bacteria from the selected biofilters. Indeed, when bac teria are pre-selected, the 
concentration of active bacteria for these CAs is higher and the µ-organisms are already 
acclimated to the chemical conditions reducing significantly the lag  phase resulting in a faster 
degradation kinetics. However, even with this pre-selection, the s equential degradation is still 
present with the maleic acid degraded first (0.5 day) and the oxam ic acid the last.  
The sequential degradation can be linked to the carbon catabolite repres sion which is an 
important regulatory mechanism for µ-organisms. It allows µ-organisms to preferentially use 
easily metabolizable carbon sources over relatively less favorable carbon source. For instance 
this phenomenon is illustrated by diauxic growth during which bacteria a ssimilate firstly 
energy-efficient and rapidly metabolizable sugars (glucose) for whic h they already have the 
enzymes then less-favored carbohydrates for which they need to synthesize  the enzymes 
(Loomis Jr. and Magasanik 1967). 
This sequential degradation of the CAs has not yet been studied whereas it can be very 
important in the case of a continuous treatment where only the most de gradable acids would be 
eliminated if a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR ) reactor  was used. To face this problem, 
a reactor with a plug flow behavior could be used; the most easily degradable CAs being 
degraded in the first layers of the reactors and the less degradable  ones in the last layers of the 
reactor. 
 
3.2.3. Inhibiting effect of the pollutant and of the AIs  on the biological degradation 
To clarify the inhibiting effect of the HCT and of its AIs, thr ee experimental conditions were 
compared: (i) the solution of 250 mgC L-1 of CAs alone, (ii) the solution of 250 mgC L-1 of 
CAs mixed with a solution of 0.42 mM of HCT and, (iii) the solution of  250 mgC L-1 of CAs  227 with a pre-treated solution containing AIs and a residual HCT concent ration of 0.015 mM. Fig. 
56 depicts the degradation of maleic acid (Fig 56 a), acetic acid (Fig 56b), oxalic acid ( Fig 56c), 
and oxamic acid (Fig 56d). As can be seen in Fig.56, the CAs are  degraded in the same order 
as in sub-section 3.2.1: first the maleic acid, then the aceti c, oxalic and finally oxamic acids 
were degraded. For all the CAs, the solution containing only the CAs  is degraded first and as 
expected the curve are very similar to the experiment of sub-se ction 3.2.1. Then, the solution 
containing the CAs and the AI is mineralized. The degradation of the solution with the HCT 
and the CAs requires a longer treatment time which is composed of t wo parts: (i) an 
accommodation time and (ii) a degradation period. For instance, for the  oxamic acid (Fig 56d), 
the accommodation time is of 2, 3 and 4 days for the CAs alone, the  CAs and the AI, and the 
CAs and the HCT, respectively, whereas the degradation period is of  0.5 and 1.5 days for the 
CAs alone and for the CAs and the HCT, respectively. The accommodat ion time and the 
degradation time are longer with the AIs and the HCT than the solution of CAs alone, showing 
that the presence of HCT and its AIs, at least temporarily, slows down the activity of the µ-
organisms. This behavior is also verified in Fig 56b and 56c for oxalic and acetic acids, 
respectively. For the maleic acid (Fig 56a), it is harder to  observe the difference between the 
curves as this acid is very quickly degraded; shorter interval of s ampling should have been 
taken to identify it. In a continuous treatment, the acclimation tim e is not important as the µ-
organisms would already be selected for the different CAs; however the kinetic of degradation 
is very important in order to eliminate the CAs during the mean resi dence time. As the kinetics 
of degradation is longer with the AIs and the HCT in the solution, it  is essential to eliminate 
them or at least to reduce significantly their concentration in o rder to have an efficient 
biotreatment on the biodegradable part of the solution (CAs).  
 
   230  
 
Fig. 58: Influence of the dilu tion of the pre -treated solution on the degradation kinetic of the acetic acid.  
 
This model and the results obtained highlight that the lower is the conce ntration of AIs the 
quicker is the degradation rate after the lag phase. The development  of these inhibition models 
could help to optimize the operational conditions of the electrochemica l treatment , the possible 
dilution and help to predict the performance of the combination of tr eatment. However more 
experiments need to be performed to achieve this objective. For condit ion D5, for the acetic 
acid, the acclimation phase was similar to that of the CAs a lone and the degradation kinetic was 
only 25% lower than for CAs. A maximum concentration of no or little inhibition could then 
be defined for the intermediates of Table 20 thanks to their peak a rea on the uHPLC.  
 
 
3.3. Application of appropriate operating conditions to optimize the combi ned 
treatment  
The main objective of this section is to use the lessons learned f rom the previous sections to 
select optimal conditions for the electrochemical treatment in order to optimize the efficiency 00.20.40.60.8
0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1k (d-1)
[AI] 231 of the combined treatment. The experiment were performed at la b scale first as the operating 
conditions are easier to handle and then they will be carried out i n the pilot reactor.  
3.3.1. Experiments with BDD anodes 
 
3.3.1.1. Finding good operating conditions at lab scale for an eff icient combined treatment  
The pilot reactor is composed of BDD electrodes that are very eff icient to eliminate pollutants 
as they are non-active anodes (Martínez-Huitle et al. 2015; Nidheesh et al. 2019). They enable 
to form adsorbed hydroxyl radicals M(•OH) on the surface of the anode material. M(•OH) are 
very powerful oxidants and efficient to eliminate organic compounds (Paniz za and Cerisola 
2009). This high efficiency has to be controlled for the combined proces s in order to only 
convert the mother pollutant to biodegradable intermediates and to limi t as much possible its 
mineralization. Thus a very low current was applied (30 mA) to de grade 230 mL of a 0.2 mM 
HCT solution. The AIs and the CAs were followed over time and the  objective was to stop the 
treatment when the concentration of CAs was maximal with the lowest concentration of AIs 
and with a reasonable amount of carbon in the solution. However, even at  a very low current it 
was not possible to eliminate all the intermediates while keepi ng a high value of TOC. The 
reaction was thus stopped after 2.5 h when the HCT was completely degraded. At this time, the 
final TOC value was 11.2 mgC L-1. The concentration of AIs were below the concentrations 
found in sub-section 3.2.3 for the condition D5, meaning that their concentra tion were not 
influencing too much the microbial activity. The TOC value was fo llowed during the post-
biological treatment and the results are depicted in Fig. 59. 28% of  the initial TOC was 
mineralized during the AO treatment. The following biological treatm ent was slow during the 
three first days corresponding to an acclimation phase, then an exponenti al increase lasted from 
day 5 to day 10 and finally a stabilization phase was observed until t he end of the experiment. 
The residual carbon (5.4 mgC L-1) at the end of the biodegradation corresponds to the non- 232 biodegradable part which was not converted into biodegradable carbon by the AO . 38% of 
initial solution were mineralized by the biological treatment ena bling to globally mineraliz e 
66%. This combined treatment was thus successful as the mineraliz ation was mainly due to the 
biological treatment enabling to save energy. Thus these operating conditions  to eliminate the 
HCT and the AIs and form CAs were successful and they were ada pted to the pilot. To achieve 
higher mineralization rates, another step of electrochemical and bi ological treatments on the 
remaining solution could be considered. In view of a combination of continuous  
electrochemical and biological treatments, a recirculation loop at  the inlet of the 
electrochemical treatment could be considered.

3.3.1.2. Finding good operating conditions for pilot scale for an e fficient combined 
treatment  
In the same way than in the previous section, the objective was to avoid mineralization and to 
promote the degradation of HCT and of AIs by applying a very low current de nsity. However 0%20%40%60%80%

Time (Days) 233 as the pilot reactor works in the continuous mode, the flow rate consti tutes also a key factor and 
its value has to be chosen carefully. As discussed in the previous chapter, a low flow rate 
encourages a high level of mineralization whereas a high flow ra te leads to mean retention time 
lower than the degradation of the pollutant. Based on the results obtaine d in chapter 3, it was 
chosen to use an intermediate flow rate of 42.5 mL min-1. Three experiments were carried out 
with three different current densities in order to reach differ ent mineralization rates: 4.0, 8.6 
and 16.2 mA cm-2 to mineralize 40, 50 and 60% of the solution, respectively. During t hese 
experiments the CAs, the main AIs, the mother pollutant and the TO C were followed. Table 22 
gives the results obtained for the three runs. As expressed in this  table, three different 
mineralization rates were obtained: 40, 47 and 60% for run 1, 2 and 3, respectively. In order to 
choose the best operating conditions, three characteristics were compared: (i) the total amount 
of CAs, (ii) the concentration of the more concentrated AI and (ii i) the percentage of elimination 
of the HCT. Concerning the degradation of HCT, run 2 and 3 attained more t han 99% of 
removal whereas run 1 reached only 91%. The total concentration of CAs w as of 0.017, 0.018 
and 0.031 mM of C for run 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Finally, only run 3 at tained the 
concentrations of AIs below the maximum value defined in sub-section 3.2.3 meaning that in 
run 1 and 2, the biodegradation could be affected by the presence of these AIs. Based on those 
criteria, the operating conditions of run 3 were selected as the  best ones.

3.3.2. Finding good operating conditions with Platine electrod e at batch scale 
To find the optimal operating conditions for a combined treatment a suit able anode is required. 
As it was demonstrated previously, the BDD anode is very efficient  to mineralize a solution but 
its very high mineralization power makes the process uncontrollable. Thus , to choose a more 
suitable anode the process has to be well understood. In the case of a ctive metal anode, the 
adsorbed hydroxyl radicals formed by oxidation of water (Eq. 58) can lead to the formation of 
high state oxide by oxygen transfer reaction  (Eq. 59). This high state oxide performs a selective 
oxidation of organic compounds contrarily to the non-active anode (such as B DD) where the 
adsorbed hydroxyl radicals are able to non-selectively mineralized  the solution which results in 
complete combustion of organics to CO 2. Thus an active anode is more suitable for a selective 
oxidation of the pollutant. Pt was chosen as it is a common active e lectrode.  
MO + H 2O ® MO(.OH) + H+ + e-        (58 )    235 MO(.OH) ® MO + H+ + e-         (59) 
As an example, oxalic acid and formic acid could not be mineralize d by the EF treatment with 
Pt anode of 2.5 L of a ranitidine solution at 112.6 mg L-1 concentration (Olvera-Vargas et al. 
2015c). Based on this example, an EF treatment was applied in order to form the maximum 
amount of CAs. Again, the concentration of CAs, the AIs and the mi neralization rate were 
followed during the process. After 1 h, all the intermediates we re degraded with mineralization 
rate of only 35% and the total CA concentration of 6.3 mgC L-1 in the solution. The CAs 
concentration was 3 times higher compared to the AO using BDD anode highlighting the bette r 
suitability of the use of a Pt electrode. Fig. 60 describes the re sults obtained for the combined 
treatment. In the same way as the experiments with BDD anode , an acclimation phase was 
observed but it was much shorter. Then, an exponential phase was observed until day 9 followed 
by a stabilization of the mineralization rate. The biological tr eatment mineralized 50% of the 
initial TOC reaching an overall mineralization degree of nearly 85% with a residual TOC of 
2.3 mgC L-1. So, to oxidize selectively the pollutants and to perform an effici ent combined 
treatment, the use of Pt anode seems more appropriate. However,  Pt being highly expensive, 
(even than BDD), a relatively chipper anode should be selected for a s cale up at industrial level. 
In this frame, DSA or sub-stoichiometric TiO 2 anodes can then be proposed for an industrial 
scale as they are relatively cheaper active anodes. At short te rm, the combined treatment should 
be tested with DSA or sub-stoichiometric TiO 2 anodes to perform the EF or AO in the pilot 
reactor before combining with biodegradation.

4. Conclusions  
 
This chapter demonstrates the clear interest of a combined treat ment between an EAOP and 
biological treatment to significantly improve the performance of biological treatment and to 
reduce the cost of the electrochemical treatment alone. The biologi cal treatment alone was not 
able to degrade the solution of HCT. It was also demonstrated tha t the operating cost could be 
divided by 3 while using the pilot in the case of a pre-treatment of 1 m3 HCT solution followed 
by a biodegradation step.   
Two experiments were carried out to understand to disrupting effect  of the AIs and the HCT 
during the degradation of four biodegradable CAs: oxalic, oxamic, maleic  and acetic acids. The 
presence in the solution of the HCT and the AI inhibit the µ-organisms’ activity by increasing 
the acclimation time and decreasing the degradation kinetic of CAs unde r study. A different lag 
phase and degradation kinetic could be identified for these CAs. The ma leic acid was 0%20%40%60%80%100%

Time (Days) 237 mineralized first followed by the acetic and oxalic acids. The ox amic acid required the longest 
treatment time. Different dilutions of the AIs and HCT soluti on w ere realized to measure their 
inhibiting effect on the mineralization of CAs. This inhibition can be modelled by a Monod 
inhibition model highlighting that the inhibition depends on the concentration of H CT and AIs 
for the acetic acid. The results obtained showed that for the di lution by 5, the concentration of 
AIs and HCT was not disrupting significantly the biodegradation. Thus, t o perform an efficient 
combined treatment, it was evidenced that some specific conditions f or the electrochemical 
treatment should be applied with the aim of i) degrading the pollutant  HCT while reaching a 
low mineralization degree, ii) reducing the AI concentration and iii ) promoting the formation 
of the biodegradable compounds like CAs.  
Finally the combined treatment at lab scale was tested in the conditions described previously. 
As BDD anode was used a low current was applied to minimize the m ineralization and promote 
the formation of CAs. The combined treatment was successful as 66%  of the solution was 
mineralized including 38% by the biotreatment. The same strate gy was then applied to the pilot 
with three conditions tested, the best condition was a current of 6. 8 A corresponding to a current 
density of 16.2 mA cm-2, a flow rate of 42.5 mL min-1 leading to 60% mineralization before the 
biological treatment. 
In order to favor the formation of CAs and a low mineralization r ate of the solution, a pre-
treatment with electro-Fenton using a Pt electrode as an active  anode was performed. With this 
anode, a mineralization degree of 85% was attained, including 50% of T OC removal by bio-
treatment which implies a drastic reduction in the operating costs . To conclude, combining an 
electrochemical treatment with a biodegradation seems to be a very efficient way to reduce the 
operating costs. However, some specific conditions should be applied and the use of an active 
anode could give even better results. Research should be done on this last  aspect.   References:

CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES  
 
 
 
 
 
 
   242    243 This thesis presents a way of treating pharmaceuticals from w astewaters. First electrochemical 
advanced oxidation processes experiments were performed at lab scale to understand the 
different operating parameters then the process was scale-up and e xperiments were carried out 
in a pilot reactor. Then based on these results, a model was designe d to describe the 
mineralization rate in the reactor. Finally to reduce the operati ng costs, the electrochemical 
process was combined with a biological treatment.   
EF treatment of the different molecules 
The oxidative degradation and mineralization of four pharmaceuticals, namely 
hydrochlorothiazide (HCT), tramadol (TMD), Nadolol (Nad) and ofloxac in (OFL), by electro-
Fenton (EF) were deeply studied in this work. The impact of two operating parameters (the 
catalyst concentration and the current) was considered for the four poll utants. For all of them 
increasing the Fe2+ concentration from 0.05 to 0.1 mM (or 0.2 mM for TMD) increas ed the 
kinetic of oxidation of 0.1 min-1 as an average among the four pollutants. However a higher 
concentration slowed down the oxidation due to side reactions. A simila r behavior was 
identified for the current. The absolute rate constant for the oxidat ion of the different molecules 
was determined using the competition kinetics method and found to be of  (4.37 ± 0.04) Î 109 
M-1 s-1, (5.59 ± 0.03) Í 109 M-1 s-1, (5.63 ± 0.03) Í 109 M-1 s-1 and (5.55 ± 0.05) Í 109 M-1 s-
1 for HCT, TMD, Nad and OFL respectively. The mineralization of these molecules was also 
successfully performed as after 6 h of EF all the solutions wer e totally mineralized. Thus the 
EF treatment was able to successfully eliminate the HCT, Na d, TMD and OFL with similar 
kinetic of degradation and totally mineralized the pharmaceutical sol utions highlighting the 
non-selectivity of the hydroxyl radicals and their ability to treat pha rmaceuticals.  
 
  244 Scale-up of the experiment 
Once the EF at lab scale was well understood and the best operati ng parameters found in batch, 
a pilot was designed and built to assess the efficiency of the proc ess at larger scale and in the 
continuous mode to be closer to real conditions. Different choices w ere made during 
construction of the lab scale pilot presented in this thesis work: (i) the configuration and the 
size of the electrodes, (ii) the aeration supply and (iii) the m anner to plug the electrodes weather 
in series or in parallel.  
(i) We have  decided to design a “plug flow reactor” by putting a stack of el ectrodes 
weather than bigger sized electrodes as the use of bigger  electrodes produces a non -
uniform repartition of the current on the electrode surface whi ch reduces the yield . 
A reasonable number of electrode -pairs  was chosen  (7 or 14 anodes) in order to study 
different parameters influencing the treatment efficiency and energy  consumption . 
The electrodes were placed  alternat ely (cathode -anode -cathode...) in order to make 
the flow run between the electrodes to increase the contact time between the 
molecules and the electrodes.  
(ii) The air supply ha d two objectives: to provide O 2 gas to the cathode to form H 2O2 and 
to increase the mixing  between two electrodes . A rubber layer with small sized hol es 
was put on the bottom of the reactor and compressed air was  blown under the pilot. 
This system is used in biological wastewater treatment  plants and provides small 
sized gas bubbles (d  < 2 mm) which favor the oxygen mass transfer to the cathode 
and the mixing.  
(iii) Finally the way of plugging the electrodes was consider ed. When BDD electrodes are 
used, a too high current can damage them . Using a parallel plugging enable s to have  245 a higher amount in each brunch of the circuit w hich  is not possible in series as  the 
current is not divided. Thus the electrodes were plug ged in parallel.  
The study of the pilot was carried out in three parts, first a DOE (design of experiments) was 
performed in order to analyze the performance of the reactor and de fine the more impacting 
parameters. Then, to understand the flowing in the reactor, an hydr odynamic study was 
performed. Finally, a model coupling hydrodynamics and mineralization kine tics was 
developed using the results of the two previous points. 
  
 DOE  
The DOE had two objectives: first identifying the more impacting oper ational parameter and 
then to have an overview of the ability of the reactor to degrade and mineralize the selected 
pharmaceuticals. The current density, the flow rate and the catal yst (Fe2+) concentration were 
chosen based on the lab scale results (chapter 2) and on the literatur e. For the mineralization 
rate, the flow rate was the more impacting parameter with a  coefficient 2.5 and 10 times higher 
than the coefficient for the current and the catalyst concentration respectively. The Fe2+ 
concentration appeared to have nearly any effect. This latter can be  explained by the size of the 
cathode: at batch scale, the cathode covers all the inner surfac e of the electrochemical cell 
(Scathode /Vsolution  = 0.9) (chapter 2) whereas in the pilot, this ratio is signif icantly lower 
(Scathode /Vsolution  = 0.25) which implies less production of H 2O2 and thus less EF efficiency . A 
solution could be to add a carbon felt layer on the floor and on the side s of the pilot to produce 
higher amounts of hydrogen peroxide. Nevertheless there could be a worst  repartition of current 
with this addition of cathode thus, this will need to be tested.  
To evaluate the operating cost, the DOE was also performed for the  EC. The current was found 
to be divided by two when the configuration was changed from 14 electrodes t o 28 electrodes  246 which favors this second configuration. Two configurations were tested but this pilot gives  the 
opportunity to try closer distance between electrodes. Thus by reduci ng the gap between the 
electrodes, the electrical resistance could be reduced and could ma ke the pilot even more cost 
effective.  
This pilot was proved to be very efficient, able to reach nearl y total mineralization rate, thus to 
make it even more efficient an hydrodynamic study was carried out , aiming at identifying the 
role of the flow rate in the mineralization process and in the fl owing. 
 
Hydrodynamic study of the pilot 
It is one of the first time that the impact of the hydrodynamic have  been considered in an 
electrochemical reactor performing EF and AO. The first step in this part was to model the 
flowing by a Retention Time Distribution (RTD) study. Whatever the ex perimental conditions 
the model of several perfectly mixed tank reactor in series wit h a dead volume mimicked the 
experimental RTD curves. Two operational parameters were anal yzed with this model: the 
configuration of the electrodes and the flow rate. For all the conditi ons tested, the dead volume 
was less than 20 % which shows that the mixing inside the reactor w as good and it was even 
better for the 28-electrode configuration. Concerning the flow rate, t he lower it was the more 
the reactor tends to a low number of perfectly mixed tank reactors  the higher is the mean 
retention time which enables a longer contact time between the organi cs and the hydroxyl 
radicals.  
 
Model of the mineralization 
A new model was developed by combining the hydrodynamic and the pseudo first order  kinetic 
for the mineralization of the solution. The model is able to desc ribe the mineralization for  247 different positions in the reactor at steady state. Thanks to this  model it is possible to optimize 
an “electrochemical plug flow” reactor depending on the treatment obje ctives: having the 
highest mineralization rate, performing a combined treatment, reac hing a setpoint value, … To 
improve this study, an overall characterization of the role of the aeration should be performed 
related to the mineralization process and the hydrodynamic study as it plays a very important 
role in the production of H 2O2 and on the mixing. Estimating the value of constant K (by 
considering the gas-liquid transfer, the mass transfer, the troublem akers impact, the flow rate, 
etc.) will be a very important point to consider for further rese arch. Indeed, it will enable to 
save energy by having J app close to J lim which maximizes the MCE. J lim can also be reached by 
putting the adequate distance between the electrodes which will optim ize the EC and to keep 
Japp close to J lim during the entire treatment different currents could be applied to f it with the 
concentration decrease. The mathematical model will have to conside r the aeration but also 
other chemical reactions such as mediated oxidations to perfectly model the pilot and pave the 
way for an industrialization of the process. In addition, to evalua te possible disrupting effects, 
experiments on real wastewaters are needed especially the e ffect of the water hardness should 
be tested.   
This pilot is very reliable as no clogging nor leak were seen during t he two years of 
experimentation. It is particularly interesting to treat effl uents with high or moderate 
concentrations of pollutants and small particles as it increases the mass transfer and the 
conductivity of the solution and thus the MCE (Ledezma Estrada et al.  2012). For effluents with 
low concentration of pollutants the use of reactive membranes or micr o-reactors (Mousset et 
al. 2019b) should be used to reduce the mass transfer limitation but requi red a solution without 
particles to avoid fouling or clogging. Nevertheless, the use of our pilot is also possible with a 
pre-concentration step by means of active carbon (El Kateb et al.  2019), for example, or by 
improving the mass transfer with the optimization of the mixing or by reducing the loss of  248 energy by reducing the gap between the electrodes. Thus this pilot seems  to be a promising 
solution to treat wastewater effluents.  
To sum-up:  
* The scale up of the EF and the AO was shown to be very successful by demonstrating 
a very high efficiency.  
* The importance of the flow rate and the configuration were clear ly identified thanks 
to the hydrodynamic study and the DOE.  
* A model was designed enabling to optimize the operating conditions to re ach a given 
mineralization rate. 
 
Combined treatment  
The chapter 4 demonstrated the clear opportunities of a combined treat ment for two main 
reasons: first, because of the incapacity of the µ-organisms to degrade the HCT, used as a model 
pollutant, and secondly, because of the drastic reduction in operating c osts provided by this 
combined treatment. Indeed, to treat 1 m3 solution of pollutant with the use of the pilot followed 
by a biodegradation, the operating costs could be divided by three.  
To perform an efficient treatment, it was evidenced that some s pecific conditions for the 
electrochemical treatment should be applied: the aim was to degr ade the pharmaceutical 
pollutant, reduce the aromatic intermediates concentration and promot e the formation of the 
biodegradable compounds. The presence in the solution of the active substa nce and the aromatic 
intermediates (AIs) disrupt the µ-organisms’ activity by lengthening the lag phase and by 
decreasing the kinetic of degradation, promoting a sequential degradation. For the lag phase a 
continuous treatment could solve the problem as the µ-organisms would be selected and will 
thus be able to metabolize the biodegradable compounds, mainly the carbox ylic acids (CAs). 
For the kinetic of degradation there could be a problem as only the more biodegradable  249 compounds could be degraded during their residence time in the biological rea ctor. In order to 
face this problem a reactor working as a plug flow could be used. I ndeed, in the first sections 
the more biodegradable compounds would be degraded and then in further sections  the less 
biodegradable compounds would be eliminated as being the only carbon sources f or the µ-
organisms .  
Finally these operating conditions were tested with the combined treat ment at lab scale in batch 
as the operating parameters are easier to control in order to de grade the pollutant and the AIs 
and form a maximum of biodegradable compounds (CAs,..). As BDD anodes  constituted the 
pilot, a BDD anode was selected to perform the combined treatme nt at lab scale in order to find 
good operating conditions. As BDD anode is a very powerful anode, a low c urrent can be 
applied to minimize the mineralization to allow the solution t o have enough carbon for the µ-
organisms. The combined treatment was successful as 66% of the solut ion was mineralized and 
38% by the biotreatment.  
The same strategy was then applied to the pilot with three conditi ons tested. The best one was 
able to form CAs at higher concentrations and degrade more AIs. Dur ing this experiment a 
current of 6.8 A was applied and a flow rate of 42.5 mL min-1 leading to 60% of mineralization 
on the electrochemical pre-treatment was used. Only three condit ions could be tested because 
of the lack of time, but a deeper analysis would be very intere sting such as realizing a DOE 
using at least the flow rate and the current as parameters and by measuring the amount of CAs, 
AI, mother pollutant and the TOC value.  
In order to form more CAs and to mineralize less the solution, a treatment with a Pt electrode 
was performed as it is active less powerful anode. With the Pt electrode, 85% of the solution 
was mineralized including 50% by the biotreatment which implies a dras tic reduction in the 
operating costs. However, Pt electrode is very expensive thus in t he aim of industrialization a 
cheaper active anode should be used and therefore DSA or sub-stoichiometri c TiO 2 anodes can  250 be proposed. To predict the efficiency of the combined treatment it w ould be interesting to 
developpe kinetic models such as the Monod one used to describe the degradati on of the acetic 
acid.  
 
Summary of the perspectives 
The perspectives of this thesis work would mostly be concentrated on  the decrease of the costs 
which are at the moment the real problem of the method. The diffe rent axes are: 
- The use of concentrated solutions in order to have better MCE% and to  decrease the 
wasting of  energy. Two options were proposed whether to concentrate  diluted solution 
on activated carbon, for example, or to perform the electrochem ical treatment directly 
at the exit of a pharmaceutical production unit or directly on an i ndustrial organic 
wastewater.  
- The use of cheaper active anodes, such as DSA or sub-stoichiometri c TiO 2 anodes, at 
pilot scale and with the combined treatment.  
- To deeper the hydrodynamic study by considering the role of aeration, the cal culation 
of the global transfer K to better model the pilot and optimize it s performance. 
- To identify the effect of gathering the electrodes to reach J lim and to evaluate the impact 
of the iron with higher cathode surface.  
- To complexify the mathematical model to consider other chemical r eactions and the 
aeration.  
- To developpe mathematical models for the biological reactions of the pos t-treatment.

1 month in the university of Santiago in Chili with the Ecos- Sud project n°: C17E05.  The project in the 
LEQMA was to study, with a 10 L pilot reactor , the combined treatment: solar photoelectro -Fenton 
process. This process was applied to the treatment of 5 pharmaceutical s. This method of treatment 
was presented in Toledo for the 25th Topical Meeting of the International Societ y of Electrochemistry,
