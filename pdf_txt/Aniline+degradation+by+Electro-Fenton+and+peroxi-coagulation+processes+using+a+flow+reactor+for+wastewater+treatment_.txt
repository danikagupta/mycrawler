Enhanced elimination of aniline in aqueous solution was achieved by coupling electrosorption of aniline
and electrochemical activation of peroxydisulfate (PDS) at multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)
cathode, in which a synergistic effect occurred. It was found that PDS could be effectively activated undera small voltage at MWCNT cathode owing to the speci ﬁc pore structures of MWCNTs. A nonradical
oxidation pathway instead of radical-based oxidation was proposed from the cathodic activation of PDS,
wherein PDS molecules with a modi ﬁed electronic structure was suggested to be the principal reactive
species. Meanwhile, the in ﬂuences of various operation parameters such as electrode potential, PDS
concentration, presence of chloride ions on the elimination ef ﬁciency, and the stability of MWCNT
electrode were also attempted. Therefore, the electrochemical activation of PDS by MWCNT cathode is a
promising energy-saving method for the treatment of organic pollutants in wastewater.

1. Introduction
Aniline with high toxicity and potential carcinogenicity to hu-
man beings has been recognized as one of the major environmental
contaminants ( An, 2011 ;Li et al., 2012 ) since it is commonly used as
precursors for synthesis of various chemicals including isocyanate,
polyurethane, dyes, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and rubber addi-
tives ( Zhang et al., 2015 ). Therefore, ef ﬁcient approaches to removeaniline from the industry wastewater prior to the discharge into the
aquatic environment are very necessary. For instance, photo-
catalytic degradation ( Wang et al., 2015 ), microbial degradation
(Dong et al., 2015 ) as well as in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) have
been reported for removing aniline.
Among the various approaches, ISCO as a simple, easy-control
and highly ef ﬁcient technology, has been widely applied for soil
and groundwater remediation ( Seol et al., 2003 ;Kubal et al., 2008 ).
Peroxymonosulfate and peroxydisulfate (PDS) are new green oxi-
dants and their applications in ISCO technology have attracted a lot
of attention recently ( Tsitonaki et al., 2010 ;Huang et al., 2013 ;And
and Dionysiou, 2017 ;Luo et al., 2017 ). For elimination of organic
pollutants, PDS needs to be activated to generate various oxidizing*Corresponding author.

different approaches including heating ( Ji et al., 2015 ), UV irradia-
tion ( Gao et al., 2012 ), sonication ( Wang and Zhou, 2016 ), micro-
wave irradiation ( Qi et al., 2014 ), electrochemical method ( Chen
and Huang, 2015b ) and various catalysts (e.g. transition metals
(Anipsitakis and Dionysiou, 2004 ), alkaline ( Furman et al., 2010 ),
carbon materials ( Sun et al., 2012 ;Duan et al., 2015a ,2016 ), or even
organic quinone ( Fang et al., 2013 )). Among these methods, elec-
trochemical (EC) method has attracted increasing attention
because it is versatile, controllable and environmental-friendly
(Brillas and Casado, 2002 ;Govindan et al., 2014 ).
In electrochemical activation of PDS, different electrodes were
studied. Iron plate as a sacri ﬁcial electrode has been commonly
used for activating PDS to generate sulfate radicals (SO 4/C15/C0) to attack
the organic compounds, while the disposal of iron sludge produced
in this approach increases the cost ( Luo et al., 2015 ;Silveira et al.,
2017 ). Chen et al. ( Chen et al., 2014 ;Chen and Huang, 2015c ) and
Ma et al. ( Song et al., 2017 ) reported the EC activation of PDS at
platinum (Pt) cathode and anode, respectively. Their results
showed that SO 4/C15/C0mainly contributed to the mineralization of
organic pollutants in the cathodic activation of PDS while non-radical oxidation pathway was involved in the degradation of pol-
lutants by anodic activation of PDS. Interestingly, incorporation of
PDS activation into a photoelectrocatalytic process for Cu-EDTA
decomplexation was also demonstrated, where a stainless steel
mesh worked as cathode to decompose PDS into SO
4/C15/C0(Zeng et al.,
2016 ). Besides these metallic electrodes, boron-doped diamond
(BDD) electrode working as anode for PDS activation was also re-
ported ( Farhat et al., 2015 ). Nonradical pathway by the PDS acti-
vation at the BDD anode was suggested to be responsible for
diatrizoate degradation, without direct evidence though. In the
above EC studies, high voltage or high current density was usually
applied, thus increasing the energy consumption and hindering the
practical application of EC activation of PDS in environment
remediation.
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been widely utilized as electrode
materials for electrosorptive removal of salts and organic pollutants
in wastewater due to the good electrical conductivity, chemical
stability and large surface area of CNTs ( Li et al., 2011 ;Nie et al.,
2012 ). The removal of salts or organic pollutants by electro-
sorption is realized by imposing an external electrical ﬁeld (usually
the voltage applied is no more than 1.2 V) onto the electrodes
immersed in an aqueous solution and the polarized electrodes thus
attracting the oppositely charged species onto their surfaces, which
is a non-Faradic process ( Foo and Hameed, 2009 ). Therefore, it is
deduced that CNTs as cathode for EC activation of PDS can enhance
the removal ef ﬁciency of organic pollutants. On the one hand, the
pollutants can be partially removed by the electrosorption process.
Simultaneous PDS activation and electrosorption on the surface of
porous carbon electrode can facilitate the electron transport be-
tween the generated reactive species and the target pollutants,
which is bene ﬁcial for the degradation of pollutants. However, the
EC activation of PDS at multi-walled CNT (MWCNT) cathode have
been rarely reported in the literature. Additionally, though the EC
activation of PDS as aforementioned showed SO 4/C15/C0generation from
the cathodic activation by metal electrodes, mechanism involved inthe EC activation of PDS at MWCNT cathode is not clear because
much lower working voltage compared to previous studies ( Chen
and Huang, 2015a ,2015c ;Song et al., 2017 ) may result in the for-
mation of different reactive species.
In this work, MWCNT electrode was prepared and used as the
cathode for EC activation of PDS for the degradation of aniline. The
operational conditions were optimized in order to achieve high
removal ef ﬁciency of the target organic. Radical scavenging ex-
periments were performed to identify the primary oxidizingspecies produced in the electro-activation of PDS process. Finally,
the stability of such an EC/MWCNT/PDS system for aniline degra-
dation was evaluated.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
MWCNTs with a purity >97%, outer diameter of 7 e15 nm and
length >5
mm were purchased from Shenzhen Nanotech Port Co.
Ltd. The samples were heated in air at 500/C14C for 30 min in order to
remove the amorphous impurities. N2 adsorption edesorption
isotherms and pore size distribution of pristine MWCNTs and
treated MWCNTs were illustrated in Fig. SM-1 . Graphite sheets with
a thickness of 0.5 mm were obtained from Beite Graphite Company
(Yichang, China). Aniline monomer (ACS, /C2199.0%), polyvinyl
alcohol (PVA), acyclovir and glutaric acid were purchased from
Aladdin (Shanghai, China). Sodium peroxydisulfate (ACS, /C2199.0%)
was provided by Acros Organics. Methanol of chromatographic
grade was supplied by ANPEL Laboratory Technologies (Shanghai)
Inc. Other chemicals of analytical grade were purchased from
Damao Chemical Reagent Factory (Tianjin, China). All solutions
were prepared using ultrapure water of 18.25 m Ucm.
2.2. Electrochemical experiments
MWCNT electrode was fabricated by a casting method using PVA
as a binder. In brief, 85 mg MWCNTs and 15 mg PVA were dispersed
into water and the suspension was stirred at 80/C14C for 4 h in order to
obtain a homogenous slurry. Then the slurry was casted onto a
graphite sheet (4.5 cm /C24.5 cm) used as a current collector, fol-
lowed by drying in an oven at 100/C14C for 2 h.
The electrochemical cell used in this work is mainly composed
of two supporting plates made of polymethyl methacrylate, a
graphite sheet as anode, the as-prepared MWCNT cathode and a
piece of nylon cloth as spacer ( Fig. 1 ). Two Pt ribbons were used as
electrode leads for connecting to the power supplier. The cell was

experiment.C. Nie et al. / Chemosphere 206 (2018) 432 e438 433assembled with rubber gaskets and bolt to ensure sealing. Batch-
mode experiments were performed in a continuously recycling
system. In each experiment, 100 mL stock solution was continu-
ously pumped into the cell by a peristaltic pump and the ef ﬂuent
returned to the EC cell. It takes less than 1 s for the stock solution to
arrive at the surfaces of electrodes and takes 5 s for the stock so-
lution to start from the reservoir and to go back to it. A CHI elec-
trochemical workstation (CH Instruments Ins., Shanghai) was used
to impose a given potential to the EC cell. One mL sample was
withdrawn from the solution reservoir at predetermined time in-
tervals and ﬁltered through a syringe ﬁlter with polyether sulfone
membrane of 0.22 mm pore size into a HPLC vial for analysis. It
should be noted that, before adding PDS into the aniline solution
and applying the voltage to initiate the degradation process, the
solution was pumped to ﬂow through the EC cell repeatedly for
80 min to establish the adsorption-desorption equilibrium of ani-
line on the MWCNT electrode. The electrosorption experiment was
conducted without adding PDS. The oxidation experiments with
PDS alone was performed by stirring the mixed solution of PDS and
aniline in a conical ﬂask. All the experiments were performed in
duplicates or triplicates.
2.3. Analytical methods
The BET speci ﬁc surface area, pore size distribution and pore
volume were determined through N2 adsorption edesorption iso-
therms at /C0196/C14C with an Autosorb iQ station (Quantachrome
instrument). The concentration of aniline was analyzed by a high-
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Elite) equipped with
a UV detector. A mixture of methanol/ultrapure water (60/40, v/v)
was employed as a mobile phase at a ﬂow rate of 1 mL/min. Total
organic carbon (TOC) was measured with a Shimadzu TOC analyzer
(TOC-V CPHE200V, Japan). KI method was used to measure the
concentration of PDS ( Liang et al., 2008 ).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Degradation of aniline by EC/MWCNTs/PDS and comparison
with other systems
The removal of aniline by EC/MWCNTs/PDS system is shown in
Fig. 2 a. As seen, around 30% aniline was absorbed by the MWCNT
electrode, ascribing to the large surface area of MWCNTs(442 m
2g/C01), and a 98% removal was reached within 150 min under
a voltage of /C00.6 V (MWCNT electrode was connected to the
negative pole of power supply), indicating the ef ﬁcient ECactivation of PDS at MWCNT cathode. Meanwhile, removal of
acyclovir by EC/MWCNTs/PDS system was also investigated and a
removal rate of 77% was achieved ( Fig. 2 b). For comparison, aniline
removal by PDS alone, electrosorption at MWCNT cathode (elec-
trosorption/MWCNTs), electro PDS activation at graphite cathode
(EC/Graphite/PDS system), and PDS activation at MWCNTs elec-
trode without voltage applied (MWCNTs/PDS system) were also
investigated and corresponding results are shown in Fig. 2 a.
It was apparent that PDS alone had low oxidative capacity to-
wards acyclovir and aniline with around 20% degradation and
graphite electrode possessed a very low adsorption capacity for
aniline. The dramatic drop of aniline concentration once the voltage
was applied in the EC/Graphite/PDS system should be resulted from
the deposition of polyaniline ﬁlm at graphite anode. In this work,
the graphite paper electrode was used as both counter electrode
and reference electrode for the EC activation of PDS while the
electrochemical polymerization of aniline can be initialized even at
a potential of 0.2 V vsSCE ( Wei et al., 1989 ). As a result, formation of
polyaniline at graphite anode was induced with a voltage of /C00.6 V
applying on the EC cell. The above result based on the EC/Graphite/
PDS system also implied that electrochemical polymerization ofaniline at graphite anode might contribute to the high removal rate
(98%) achieved by EC/MWCNTs/PDS system as well. However, the
concentration of aniline barely changed after the polymerization
process in the EC/Graphite/PDS system, revealing the inability for
PDS activation by such a system. The extremely low removal rate of
acyclovir ( <6%) as shown in Fig. 2 b further demonstrated the
inability for PDS activation by EC/Graphite/PDS system.
An improved PDS activation ef ﬁciency under a small voltage was
exhibited by the EC/MWCNTs/PDS system, attributing to the high
adsorption capacity of MWCNTs for PDS. Evidently, graphite cath-
ode can hardly adsorb S
2O82/C0co-ions (ions with negative charge as
MWCNT cathode) in the electrical double layers formed on the
surface of the electrode because of the repulsion force and the low
speci ﬁc surface area of graphite electrode (19.4 m2g/C01). While in
the EC/MWCNTs/PDS system, a signi ﬁcant amount of S 2O82/C0anions
can still be captured in the electrical double layers of MWCNT
cathode at a small external current. The abundant macropores and
micropores of MWCNTs are responsible for the formation of elec-
trical double layer structure ( Suss et al., 2015 ). The good contact
between S 2O82/C0ions and MWCNT cathode facilitates the electron
transfer at the interfaces, resulting in an enhanced PDS activation
efﬁciency.
In the electrosorption/MWCNTs system, aniline molecules could
be further removed after the adsorption-desorption equilibrium at
a small negative voltage, which was in agreement with previous

the MWCNT cathode may be bene ﬁcial to the degradation of aniline
in the EC/MWCNTs/PDS system. Simultaneous PDS activation and
electrosorption of organic compounds on the surface of MWCNT
electrode can facilitate the electron transport from the organic
compounds to the surface con ﬁned reactive PDS complexes.
Regarding the MWCNTs/PDS system, MWCNTs have been
demonstrated to be an ef ﬁcient PDS activator ( Sun et al., 2014 ;Lee
et al., 2015 ) and the aniline removal (95%) achieved in the ﬁrst cycle
was similar to that of EC/MWCNTs/PDS system. However, it
decreased rapidly in the second (67%) and third cycles (63%). Such
observations have been reported in other carbonaceous materials-
catalyzed PDS systems ( Sun et al., 2012 ;Duan et al., 2015a ;Lee
et al., 2016 ), possibly arising from adsorption of the intermediates
on the surfaces of catalysts and the coverage or oxidation of the
active sites during the degradation processes. In contrast to the
MWCNTs/PDS system, the aniline removal rate of EC/MWCNTs/PDS
system decreased by 9% after nine cycles, suggesting that a different
mechanism of PDS activation was involved in this study.
3.2. Mechanism of EC activation of PDS at MWCNT cathode
Previous studies have demonstrated that cathodic activation of
PDS mainly generates SO 4/C15/C0following Eq. (1)(Wang and Chu,
2011 ):
S2O82/C0þe/C0/SO4/C15/C0þSO42/C0(1)
Toﬁnd out whether the similar reaction occurs in EC/MWCNTs/
PDS system, radical scavenging experiment by adding methanol
into aniline solution was conducted, since methanol can scavenge
both SO 4/C15/C0and HO/C15, and the results are illustrated in Fig. 3 a. Sur-
prisingly, excess methanol at a dose up to 180 times of PDS's molar
concentration in solution hardly inhibited the degradation of ani-
line, indicating that neither SO 4/C15/C0nor HO/C15was responsible for the
aniline degradation. Additionally, scavenging experiment usingNaN
3which serving as a scavenger for singlet oxygen ( Qi et al.,
2016 ) with acyclovir as the target organic pollutant was conduct-
ed and the results were shown in Fig. 3 b. It was found that the
addition of NaN 3had negligible impact on the degradation of
acyclovir, indicating that singlet oxygen was not responsible for the
EC activation of PDS at MWCNT cathode, and other types of reactive
species instead of singlet oxygen were generated from the EC
activation of PDS. Therefore, in EC activation of PDS at MWCNT
cathode the nonradical oxidation may play the dominant role in
aniline degradation rather than relying on the free radicals.
The different mechanism involved in EC/MWCNTs/PDS system
may be related to the properties of the electrode and the workingvoltage used. Similar to the graphite cathode, the traditional Pt, iron
or stainless steel cathode for EC activation of PDS also possesses a
low adsorption capacity of PDS. The activation via the one-electron
reduction reaction (Eq. (1)) was mainly stimulated by the elec-
trolysis at high working voltages used in those experiments
(Govindan et al., 2014 ;Chen and Huang, 2015b ;Zeng et al., 2016 ). In
the current study, more S 2O82/C0anions can be con ﬁned in the surface
pores of MWCNTs cathode. The small voltage for EC activation of
PDS could not trigger the occurrence of Eq. (1), but leading to other
changes of PDS. According to previous studies ( Zhang et al., 2014 ;
Duan et al., 2015b ;Lee et al., 2015 ,2016 ), even the outer-sphere
interactions between CuO, CNTs or graphitized nanodiamonds
and PDS can stimulate PDS molecule to form a reactive complex
without instantly releasing sulfate radicals into the bulk solution.
As a consequence, it could be speculated that the low current
density at MWCNT cathode could also alter the arrangement of
electron con ﬁguration of the adsorbed S 2O82/C0ions to produce
activated and surface-bonded oxidizing species for degrading the
electron-rich substances via electron-transfer.
Different from bulk S 2O82/C0, the MWCNT-adsorbed S 2O82/C0with a
modi ﬁed electronic structure is highly reactive towards organic
compounds, as evidenced in CuO/PDS ( Zhang et al., 2014 ), CNTs/
PDS ( Lee et al., 2015 ), graphitized nanodiamond/PDS ( Lee et al.,
2016 ), dimensional-structured nanocarbons/PDS ( Duan et al.,
2015b ) and EC/(Ti/Pt anode)/PDS systems ( Song et al., 2017 ). It
should be noted that the radical scavenging experiments with
MWCNTs/PDS in this work (not shown) also implied the nonradical
mechanisms. The electric current plays a key role in the EC acti-
vation of PDS process ( Zhang et al., 2014 ;Duan et al., 2015b ;Lee
et al., 2015 ,2016 ). A similar conclusion was also drawn for the
EC/(Ti/Pt anode)/PDS system ( Song et al., 2017 ). Unfortunately,
suitable in situ characterization methods for investigating the
modi ﬁed electronic structure of PDS are lacking at present.
Compared to the radical-based oxidation, nonradical oxidation
exhibits better selectivity towards electron-rich organic com-
pounds, hence minimizing the occurrence of undesired side re-
actions ( Zhang et al., 2014 ).
3.3. Effect of working voltage on aniline degradation by EC/
MWCNTs/PDS system
Various voltages ranging from /C01.0 to /C00.4 V were applied on
the MWCNT electrode and the corresponding degradation perfor-
mance of aniline in EC/MWCNTs/PDS system is shown in Fig. 4 .
When the working voltage was increased from /C00.4 to /C00.6 V, the
degradation ef ﬁciency and TOC removal were improved slightly,
indicating that a low voltage is ef ﬁcient for the EC activation of PDS
by MWCNT cathode. The small difference in degradation ef ﬁciency

addition of 1 M methanol or 55.5 mM NaN 3; Conditions: [aniline] 0¼0.45 mM; [acyclovir] 0¼0.45 mM; [PDS] 0¼5.55 mM; voltage ¼/C00.6 V.C. Nie et al. / Chemosphere 206 (2018) 432 e438 435may be due to an increase in electrosorptive removal of aniline by
MWCNT electrode in the working voltage. However, the degrada-
tion performance could not be improved at a further increasing
voltage. Polymerization occurs in the aniline solution under high
voltages as evidenced by HPLC chromatograms ( Fig. SM-2 ). For raw
aniline samples, a peak at retention time (t R) of 4.7 min was
observed, referring to aniline molecule. At voltage of /C00.4
and/C00.6 V, t Rof the aniline peak remained constant. At voltage
of/C00.8 and /C01.0 V, the shape and t Rof the aniline peak changed
gradually, suggesting polyaniline production and oxidation by
activated PDS. The activated PDS exhibited a lower reactivity to-
ward polyaniline compared to aniline, thereby resulting in a lower
mineralization rate. Fig. 5 c and d revealed that a higher working
voltages ( /C01.0 V) could induce a faster polyaniline formation (at
80 min) and consequently worsen the aniline degradation.
A comparison between our EC/MWCNTs/PDS system and the EC/
Pt/PDS system reported in by Chen et al. regarding the aniline
degradation was made as shown in Table SM-1 . It can be seen that
the EC/MWCNTs/PDS system exhibited comparable TOC removal
rate to the EC/Pt/PDS system but requiring much lower voltage,which can reduce the energy consumption of EC method signi ﬁ-
cantly. In addition, the transient current curves during the aniline
degradation process by EC/MWCNTs/PDS system were recorded
(Fig. SM-3 ). It was clearly seen that a small hump was present in the
current curves with the voltage of /C00.8 V applied for EC activation
of PDS, indicating the occurrence of aniline polymerization. Speci ﬁc
energy consumption per unit TOC mass removed (EC
TOC) proposed
byDominguez et al. (2018) , which can be considered as an indicator
of the cost of the technology when considering the practical
application in wastewater treatment for aniline removal under
various voltages, was also calculated in this work and listed inTable SM-2 . Apparently, EC TOCcalculated in this work was quite low
and it increased with the voltages. Meanwhile the EC TOCexhibited
by our EC/MWCNTs/PDS system were much lower than that (more
than 1 kWh (gTOC)/C01) reported for lindane degradation by elec-
trooxidation process with different types of electrodes ( Dominguez
et al., 2018 ), possibly due to the reasons: lindane is more dif ﬁcult to
be mineralized than aniline, the area of the electrodes used for
lindane degradation was higher than our electrodes which could
increase the resistance during the electrooxidation process, and the
current density (8.33 mA cm/C02) was much higher than that used in
our work (the average current density during the 2.5 h degradation
process of aniline under a voltage of /C00.6 V was estimated to be
0.12 mA cm/C02).
3.4. Effect of PDS concentration on aniline degradation in EC/
MWCNTs/PDS system
Different amounts of PDS in the EC activation process were
tested for the optimal PDS concentration for aniline degradation. It
is shown in Fig. 5 a that the removal rate of aniline increased slightly
with the PDS concentration, implying a negligible in ﬂuence of PDS
dosage on the degradation ef ﬁciency. To explain such phenomena,
the variation of PDS concentration during the degradation process
was investigated and shown in Fig. 5 b. It was found that the
amount of decomposed PDS was 1.3 mM and 1.43 mM in the case of
1.85 mM PDS addition and 5.55 mM PDS addition, respectively.
Such a small difference of PDS decomposition during the EC acti-
vation process with different PDS dosage suggests that the ability of
our EC/MWCNTs/PDS system to activate PDS under the current
conditions is limited. As a consequence, further increase of PDS
concentration slightly enhances the degradation process.

PDS system
In the industrial and domestic wastewaters, salts and diverse
natural organic matters are commonly present. Chloride ions, as
ubiquitous aqueous ions, will in ﬂuence the degradation of organic
pollutants when SO 4/C15/C0-based advanced oxidation processes are
involved. It has been demonstrated that chloride ions can be
oxidized by SO 4/C15/C0forming Cl/C15at a high reaction rate
(kfor¼3.0/C2108M/C01s/C01), and the Cl/C15rapidly reacts with another
chloride ion to produce Cl 2/C15/C0(chlorine radicals), which possesses a
lower redox potential with respect to SO 4/C15/C0
(Anipsitakis et al., 2006 ). The formation of
chlorine radicals may inhibit or improve the organic contaminant
degradation rate depending on the target contaminant ( Yang et al.,
2014 ). The effect of chloride ions on the nonradical oxidation from
EC activation of PDS at MWCNT cathode were then evaluated.
Fig. 6 displays that addition of 5.55 mM Cl/C0had a slight effect on
aniline degradation and that the Cl/C0concentrations at
11.1e16.65 mM inhibited the degradation of aniline lightly. This can
be considered as another proof of nonradical mechanisms involvedin the EC/MWCNTs/PDS system. The inhibitory effect of elevated
Cl
/C0concentration in electrochemical activation of PDS process may
be caused by the competitive adsorption between Cl/C0and S 2O82/C0
which are both negatively charged to be adsorbed on electrode
surface ( Song et al., 2017 ). It is interesting to mention that addition
of Cl/C0into carbamazepine degradation process by EC activation of
PDS at Ti/Pt anode had a positive in ﬂuence on the carbamazepine
degradation, which was ascribed to the generation of free chlorine
by electrolysis since a high current density was employed in that
work ( Song et al., 2017 ).
3.6. Stability of EC/MWCNTs/PDS system for aniline degradation
For practical application in wastewater treatment, the reus-
ability of MWCNT electrode for EC activation of PDS and degrada-
tion of aniline is important. Recycling experiments are presented in
Fig. 7 . The aniline removal declined by 9% after 9 runs, which may
be related to the deposition of polyaniline ﬁlm on the graphite
anode. With the accumulated deposition and partially oxidation of
polyaniline ﬁlm in each cycle, the resistance of the anode could
increase to hinder the EC activation of PDS and aniline degradation.Meanwhile, the current evolution as a function of time during the
aniline degradation process for different runs were recorded in
Fig. SM-4 . It was shown that the current intensity ﬂowing through
the EC/MWCNTs/PDS system decreased gradually in each run,
indicating that the resistance of the whole system increased which
harms the degradation performance of the system. Especially, small
humps were present in the current curves during the 8th run and
9th run of aniline degradation experiments, which may be a hint of
the occurrence of aniline polymerization during the degradation
process. Optimization of experimental conditions to diminish the
polyaniline deposition will be conducted in the future. In addition,
the degradation of other organic pollutants by the EC/MWCNTs/
PDS system is ongoing in our group to evaluate the potential ap-
plications in wastewater treatment of such a technique.
4. Conclusions
MWCNT electrode was used as cathode for EC activation of PDS
and the degradation of aniline was investigated. A series of control
experiments showed that MWCNT electrode not only enhanced the
PDS activation ef ﬁciency signi ﬁcantly but also reduced the working
voltage for ef ﬁcient degradation of aniline. A synergistic effect of
electrosorption of aniline and EC activation of PDS results in the
facilitated electron transfer between the organic compound and
generated reactive species on the surface of electrode. Nonradical
oxidation process is mainly involved in the EC activation of PDS at
MWCNT cathode. The formation of S 2O82/C0with rearranged elec-
tronic con ﬁguration was proposed to be accountable for the non-
radical oxidation pathway. The presence of high concentration ofCl
/C0slightly impeded the aniline degradation due to the competitive
adsorption between Cl/C0and S 2O82/C0. EC/MWCNTs/PDS system was
stable for PDS activation and may serve as an energy-saving tech-
nology for remediation of groundwater.
