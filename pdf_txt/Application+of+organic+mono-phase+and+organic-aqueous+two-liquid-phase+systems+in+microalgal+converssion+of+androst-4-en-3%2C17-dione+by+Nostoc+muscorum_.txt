Abstract The present study aimed at evaluating the ability
of some isolated cyanobacterial and microalgal strains for
the removal of ρ-chlorophenol ( ρ-CP), an environmentally
harmful contaminant. To identify the most efficient species,
a screening program was carried out using 15 microalgal
and cyanobacterial strains. Among them, Tetraselmis sue-
cica was able to remove 67 % of the ρ-chlorophenol at an
initial concentration of 20 mg L−1from the medium within a
10-day period. The efficacy of the process was dependent ontheρ-chlorophenol concentration. At concentrations above
60 mg L
−1of the pollutant, no removal was observed due to
the inhibitory effect of ρ-chlorophenol on the T. suecica
cells. The effect of cell immobilization in alginate beads
onT. suecica removal capacity was also examined. Using
this technique, the removal efficacy for the initial ρ-CP
concentration of 20 mg L−1increased up to 94 %.Keywords ρ-Chlorophenol .Immobilization .Microalgae .

Introduction
The contamination of aquatic ecosystems by phenolic com-
pounds is a serious environmental problem (Scragg 2006 ).
In aqueous environments, these pollutants affect the com-munity composition of phytoplanktons, which in turn may
result in harmful effects on higher levels of the food chain
(Jensen 1996 ). While the level of chlorophenols in a marine
environment should be below 10 μgL
−1, there are reports of
the presence of concentrations of 0.5 –10,000 μgL−1of
these hazardous pollutants in industrial effluents(Petroutsos et al. 2007 ). The US Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) lowered the allowable amounts of chlorophe-
nol concentration from several mg L
−1to <1 mg L−1
(Denizli et al. 2004 ).ρ-Chlorophenol ( ρ-CP) is a halogenat-
ed phenolic compound that is used as an intermediate during
the synthesis of insecticides, herbicides, preservatives, anti-septics, and disinfectants (Petroutsos et al. 2008 ). It is also
used in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, dyes, aromatic
compounds, and other organic materials (Petroutsos et al.
2008 ). Due to this widespread usage, as well as its abun-
dance in oil refineries and coke manufacturing effluents(Anirudhan et al. 2009 ),ρ-CP is considered to be a priority
environmental pollutant (Olivier et al. 2003 ; Scragg 2006 ).
Although some physicochemical methods, such as TiO

photocatalysis, electron-beam irradiation (Shi et al. 2009 ),
UV/Fenton oxidation (Du et al. 2005 ), electrochemical ox-
idation (Zhou et al. 2005 ), carbon adsorption (Anirudhan etH. Forootanfar :M. Shakibaie :Z. Bagherzadeh :

Provided by Simorgh Research Repositoryal.2009 ), solvent extraction, and chemical oxidation
(Gonzalez et al. 2010 ), have been proposed for the removal
ofρ-CP, the advantages of the biological degradation of
pollutants, such as lower costs, higher efficiency, and less
toxicity, have persuaded researchers to apply this environ-
mentally friendly method. The ability of bacteria (Yao et al.2006 ; Carvalho et al. 2001 ; Caldeira et al. 1999 ), fungi,
especially laccase producing fungi (Forootanfar et al.
2012 ), and cyanobacteria (Pavlostathis and Jackson 2002 ;
Shashirekha et al. 1997 ) to degrade phenolic pollutants has
been extensively studied, whereas a limited number of
reports have focused on the degradation potency of photo-synthetic microalgae (Lima et al. 2004 ; Hirooka et al. 2003 ;
Semple et al. 1999 ), which are able to either eliminate
aromatic and azo dye compounds or utilize them as carbonor nitrogen sources. For example, golden unicellular alga,
Ochromonas danica , can completely degrade phenolic com-
pounds and utilize them as a carbon source (Pinto et al.2002 ; Semple et al. 1999 ). Furthermore, the special degra-
dation pathways of xenobiotics make the use of microalgae,
which perform the ortho- and meta-cleavage of the aromaticrings and conjugation (Lovell et al. 2002 ; Petroutsos et al.
2007 ), more preferable than bacterial strains.
The advantages of cell immobilization, such as long-term
stabilization, higher cell density, and increased specific
yield, encouraged research ers to apply this technique
(Arabi et al. 2010 ). Despite the widespread use of bacterial
and fungal immobilization for the biotransformation of
xenobiotics (Kutney et al. 1985 ;M a n o s r o ie ta l . 2003 ),
immobilized microalgae have rarely been employed for this
purpose (Arabi et al. 2010 ).
The aim of the present study was to screen microalgal
and cyanobacterial strains from our laboratory ’s local col-
lection (Faramarzi et al. 2008 ; Hajimahmoodi et al. 2010 )
that are capable of removing ρ-chlorophenol, a hazardous
pollutant, in order to introduce an efficient microalga for ρ-
CP removal in aqueous cultures. Further investigation was
performed on the removal by immobilizing the selectedmicroalga in alginate beads.
Materials and methods
Axenic cultures of 15 microalgae and cyanobacteria strains
were obtained from various sources and screened for p-
chlorophenol degradation efficiency (Table 1). The algal
strains were maintained on sterile BG-11 (Arabi et al. 2010;
Borowitzka 1988) agar slants at 4°C and freshly subcultured
before being used. A loopful of each strain was individually
inoculated into 100 mL of f/2 artificial seawater (forTetraselmis suecica )( B o r o w i t z k a 1988 )o rB G - 1 1
(Borowitzka 1988) medium (for other strains) in a 500-mL
Erlenmeyer flask and incubated at 25°C in a shaker (100 rpm)under continuous illumination of 60 μmol photons m−2s−1
supplied by three fluorescent tubes for at least 48 h. The initial
pH of the cultivation flasks was adjusted at 7.2 using Tris –HCl
(40 mM) prior to sterilization by autoclave (Petroutsos et al.
2007).
Screening for microalgae with ρ-CP removal ability
In order to obtain tolerant strains, each microalga was adap-
ted to the ρ-chlorophenol in a stepwise procedure prior to
screening. Thereafter, the tolerant microalgae were cultivat-
ed in f/2 artificial seawater or BG-11 for 48 h, and then theρ-CP [from a stock solution of ρ-CP in high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade methanol] was added
to the culture medium under aseptic conditions to a finalconcentration of 20 mg L
−1(Petroutsos et al. 2007 ), fol-
lowed by the incubation of the bottles in an incubator shaker
(25°C, 100 rpm) under continuous illumination. The finalconcentration of methanol in the medium was 0.006 % ( v/v).
Samples of 1 mL were taken every other day, cells were
removed by centrifugation at 8,000× gfor 6 min, and the
concentration of ρ-CP in the supernatant was determined by
HPLC. Similarly, the pellets were washed with methanol
and centrifuged at 8,000× gfor 6 min, and the methanol
extract was analyzed by HPLC to estimate the amount of
ρ-CP that entered into or adsorbed on the cells. Each exper-
iment was performed in triplicate. The control bottles weredesigned to investigate abiotic elimination by introducing ρ-
CP to the algae-free culture media.
HPLC analysis
Quantitative studies were performed by HPLC (Knauer,
Germany). The data were acquired and processed by means
of ChromGate software (version 3.3.1), also from Knauer.
Chromatographic separation was achieved on a Lichrospher
100 RP & EC C
8reverse phase column (C8, 25×0.46 cm i
d, 5μm particle size; Teknokroma, Spain). Detection was at
280 nm. The isocratic solvent used was water/methanol/
acetic acid (49:50:1, v/v/v) with a flow rate of 2 mL min−1.
The retention time for ρ-CP was 7 min. The ρ-CP concen-
tration was determined using a standard curve obtained from
known concentrations of ρ-CP in which the limit of detec-
tion was found to be 0.085 mg L−1. 1,2-Dichlorobenzene
was used as an internal standard (Angerer and Schaller
2001 ; Sadeghi-aliabadi et al. 2009 ). Cell numbers were
determined using a Neubauer hemocytometer.
The effect of the initial ρ-CP concentration on the removal
ofρ-CP by T. suecica
TheT. suecica cells were grown in the f/2 artificial seawater
medium to a final concentration of 0.5 –1×105cells mL−1.52 J Appl Phycol (2013) 25:51 –57Thirty milliliters of this culture was used to inoculate
270 mL of f/2 medium containing 10, 20, 40, and
60 mg L−1ofρ-CP in 1,000-mL culture bottles. The
cultures were then incubated at 25°C under continuous
illumination of 60 μmol photons m−2s−1, while the
media were bubbled by sterile air. Three bottles wereused for each concentration to achieve a mean for the
ρ-CP removal. A control bottle was also designed to
investigate abiotic pollutant removal. Samples were takenevery other day and analyzed by HPLC after centrifugation,
as previously described.
The effect of NaHCO
3concentrations on T. suecica
pollutant elimination
To investigate the biomass productivity and T. suecica re-
moval of ρ-CP in the presence of bicarbonate as a carbon
source, various concentrations (0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 g L−1)o f
NaHCO 3were added to the pre-inoculated culture media
(see above) and incubated at 25°C, while sterile air was
bubbled through the media. This was followed by determin-ing the mass production and pollutant elimination of the test
bottles (in triplicates), as compared to the control bottle that
did not have bicarbonate salt added.
Assay for laccase activity
To determine T. suecica intracellular laccase activity, the
harvested biomass was washed three times by an acetate
buffer of 100 mM pH 4.5, followed by cell disruption bygrinding the frozen cells in liquid nitrogen with a mortar and
pestle. The cell debris was discarded after centrifugation
(8,000× g, 5 min) and the supernatant used for the laccase
activity determination, according to Forootanfar et al.
(2011 ).
The effect of cell immobilization in sodium alginate
onρ-CP elimination
After the cultivation of T. suecica in the air-bubbled bottle at
25°C under continuous illumination, the cell biomass was
harvested in the logarithmic phase (1.2×10
6cells mL−1)b y
centrifugation (2.0×103×gfor 10 min at 4°C), in order to
reach 5 mL packed cell volume (Arabi et al. 2010 ), and then
followed by mixing it homogenously with the same volume
of 2 % w/vsodium alginate solution. The mixture was
passed through a needle into a cold calcium chloridesolution of 0.2 M and left for 1 h. The alginate beads
were washed with distilled water before being used
(Ramachandra Rao et al. 1999 ). The beads were added
to 20 mL of an f/2 medium containing 20, 40, and
60 mg L
−1ofρ-CP, followed by incubation at 25°C
and continuous illumination, in order to investigate theability of immobilized cells to remove ρ-CP. To inves-
tigate the ρ-CP adsorption or entrance into the alginate
beads in a separate trial, a control bottle containing thesame ρ-CP concentration to alginate beads but without
cells was used. The control beads were extracted by
methanol and subjected to HPLC analyses. All experimentswere done in triplicate.
Results
Screening studies were carried out using a ρ-CP concentra-
tion of 20 mg L
−1(Petroutsos et al. 2007 ). As shown in
Table 1,T. suecica was able to remove 67 % of the ρ-CP
from the medium after 10 days, while Nostoc muscorum H1,
Chlorella vulgaris ,a n d Fischerella ambigua transformed
56, 51, and 46 % of the pollutant, respectively. During this
period, no removal occurred in the uninoculated controlmedia. Based on these results, T. suecica was selected for
further studies.
Figure 1shows the effect of ρ-CP concentration on T.
suecica growth. Cell growth was considerably suppressed at
concentrations above 40 mg L
−1, and at 60 mg L−1,n o
growth was detected. Increasing the initial concentration ofρ- C Pu pt o2 0m gL
−1led to an increase in the removal
efficacy of T. suecica (Fig. 2). However, at higher concen-
trations, ρ-CP removal was lower due to its toxic effect. The
absence of ρ-CP in the methanol extract of the microalgal
pellets indicated no ρ-CP bioaccumulation.
Increasing the concentration of NaHCO 3t o1gL−1led to
more biomass production and consequently more pollutant
elimination (Fig. 3). The concentration above 1 g L−1de-
creased both the cell count and pollutant removal.
When immobilized cells were used, the efficacy of T.
suecica ’sρ-CP removal (at a concentration of 20 mg L−1)
was increased to 94 % (Fig. 4). It is of interest to note that,
after immobilization, the time required to remove 73 % of
theρ-CP from the medium was reduced to 4 days, which is
less than half the time required to obtain the same results
using free T. suecica cells. The entrapped cells were able to
remove 34 and 26 % of the pollutant at the initial concen-trations of 40 and 60 mg L
−1, respectively, after a 10-day
period. The amount of ρ-CP absorbed into the alginate
beads was negligible.
Discussion
While the presence of chlorophenolic compounds at
0.5μgL−1(Jennings et al. 1996 ) is considered lethal for
some marine organisms, the concentration of these substan-
ces in industrial wastes may be much higher (Ettala et al.
1992 ; Dimou et al. 2006 ). Incomplete degradation and theJ Appl Phycol (2013) 25:51 –57 53production of hazardous byproducts from using physico-
chemical methods for the removal of chemical pollutants
(Pera-Titus et al. 2004 ) persuaded researchers to use biolog-
ical systems for the removal of such harmful compounds(Denizli et al. 2005 ). In this study, the ability of some
microalgal and cyanobacterial strains to remove these pol-
lutants was investigated by incorporating ρ-CP into the
culture medium. Among them, T. suecica was the most
efficient strain and removed 67 % of ρ-CP. N. muscorum
H1,C. vulgaris , and F . ambigua were able to eliminate 56,
51, and 46 % of the pollutant, respectively. In a similarstudy, it was shown that Tetraselmis marina can eliminate
65 % of ρ-CP when this compound is added to the medium
at an initial concentration of 20 mg L
−1(Petroutsos et al.
2007 ). The lag phase of growth of T. suecica increased with
increasing the pollutant concentration from 10 to 60 mg L−1
(Fig. 1). This toxic property decreased the ability of T.
suecica to remove ρ-CP when the pollutant level was in-
creased in the culture medium (Fig. 2). According to the
profiles of ρ-CP removal (Figs. 1and2), it seems that ρ-CP
was not used as a primary growth substrate by the algae
because ρ-CP elimination increased by enhancing the cell
numbers during the 10-day period. Besides cell adsorption
and the entrance of such organic pollutants (bioaccumula-
tion), biodegradation/biotransformation is another biologi-cal pathway for removing organic contaminants. The
degradation of substituted phenols by purified laccase (ben-
zenediol/oxygen oxidoreductase: EC 1.10.3.2) and laccaseproducing microorganisms is an environmental application

activity, as well as the absence of ρ-CP in the microalgal
pellet methanol extract (bioaccumulation) in our investiga-
tion, indicated that T. suecica utilized another pathway to
eliminate ρ-CP from the culture medium. Petroutsos et al.
(2008 ) also used T. suecica and found that 2,4-dichlorophe-
nol was conjugated to β-D-glucopyranoside and β-D-(6-O-
malonyl)-glucopyranoside, which reduced the toxicity of
this hazardous compound. Such conjugation reactions may
also be the likely mechanism of ρ-CP removal. However,
the HPLC chromatogram done 1 h after ρ-CP elution (data
not shown) revealed no possible metabolite, which was
probably due to an inappropriate mobile phase and/or mask-ing of the metabolite peak by the ρ-CP. The best concentra-
tion of NaHCO
3,in which maximum elimination and
biomass production were observed, was 1 g L−1. The de-
crease of both ρ-CP removal and cell count above this
critical concentration might be ascribed to the toxic effect
of produced CO 2. This finding is in agreement withPetroutsos et al. ( 2007 ), indicating a straight correlation
between cell count and pollutant removal to the addition
of bicarbonate. Yan and Pan ( 2004 ) also determined the
significant effect of NaHCO 3addition on the biodegradation
of dimethyl phthalate using Closterium lunula . In order to
improve their removal capacity, the T. suecica cells were
immobilized in alginate beads. This method not only in-
creased removal efficacy to 94 % but also decreased the
time required to achieve 73 % removal from 10 to 4 days.Furthermore, the encapsulated cells had the ability to re-
move more ρ-CP compared to suspended cells at higher
toxic concentrations (40 and 60 mg L
−1). It seems that
higher reaction rates due to the presence of higher cell
densities in the immobilized form, compared to a free sus-
pension culture (Arabi et al. 2010 ), increased the ability of T.
suecica to remove more pollutants. These results are in
agreement with other studies, which also utilized immobili-
zation techniques. Santos-Rosa et al. ( 1989 ) studied the
improvement of ammonium production from nitrite by
immobilizing Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in alginate beads.
In addition, phosphorous uptake (Robinson 1995 )a n d
heavy metal removal capacity of algae were found to be
increased by entrapping cells in alginate beads (Wilkinson et
al.1990 ). It seems that immobilized cells are less sensitive
to inhibition by ρ-chlorophenol (Arabi et al. 2010 ).
In conclusion, the ease of growing and culturing T. suecica
with only a few simple salts and the possibilities of applying
immobilization techniques are the main advantages for
employing T. suecica in further studies of removing pollutants
such as chlorophenols. In addition, T. suecica is a marine
microalga and could be used to remove ρ-CP in seawater.
