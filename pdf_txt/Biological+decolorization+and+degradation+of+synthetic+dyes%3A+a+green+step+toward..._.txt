Abstract  
Azoreductase  is an important enzyme for the reduction of the azo linkage 
of dye during the biodecolorization process. In the present study, the 
production of intracellular azoreductase from bacterial cultures 
Enterobacter dissolvens  AGYP1 (ED) and Pseudomonas aerugino sa AGY P2 
(PA) was achieved during bio decolorization of synthetic textile dye Acid 
Maroon V. When compared with PA, the enzyme activity of ED was 2.31 
times greater. The partial purification of azoreductase revealed specific 
activity of the dialyzed enzyme 51.72 U mg-1 protein (ED) and 33.06 U mg-
1 protein (PA). Methyl Red served as the best substrate for the 
azoreductase enzyme with superior activity at optimal pH 7 and 
temperature 30 °C. 75 -80% of azoreductase enzyme activity was 
maintained when Mg+2 and Ca+2 were present. The azoreductase activity 
was considerably increased with NADH as the most suitable electron 
donor. The kinetic study showed consequent Michaelis -Menten constant 
(Km) and maximal velocity (V max) values of 50 μM and 2222 U ml-1 (ED) 
and 250 μM and 1000 U ml-1 (PA), respectively.

Introduction  
Synthetic dyes offer a broad range of applications in various industrial 
sectors like textile, pulp and pap er, leather, photography, pharmaceutical, 
food, cosmetics, etc. Such dyes are more widely accepted because of their 
simpler and more affordable synthesis method, a wide range of color 
tones, and longer durability when compared to natural dyes [1]. However,  
because the synthetic dye is xenobiotic and recalcitrant, it poses serious 
risks to the environment and biological systems [2]. Due to inefficient 
dyeing processes, the wastewater from the textile sectors contains 10 to 
50% dyes [3 -4]. Additionally, dye w ith a concentration of less than 1 ppm 
is visible in the receiving water body, which is aesthetically unpleasant. 
The textile dying business is classified as a "Red Industry" (the most 
polluting sector) in several nations as a result of the release of a ma ssive 
volume of colored effluent [5]. As a result, people, researchers, and 
legislative agencies are becoming increasingly concerned with how to 
remediate colored industrial effluents [6]. Various types of 
physicochemical techniques are in use for the fate  of dyes from industrial

waste  water. However, such treatment processes have certain inherent limitations. Therefore, 
the biological method seems to be environmentally benign and the most feasible alternative to 
achieve the significant fate of synthetic dyes [7]. Different members of th e biotic community like 
species of bacteria, actinomycetes, yeasts, fungi, algae, and plants have been utilized to decolorize, 
degrade, and mineralize a range of synthetic dyes. It is thought that utilizing bacterial agents to treat 
hazardous dyes is an ef ficient strategy. For the biodecolorization of the array of synthetic dyes, both 
pure and mixed bacterial cultures are widely used [1 -2, 8 -9]. The main processes of bacterial 
decolorization of synthetic dyes include bioaccumulation, biosorption, and enzyma tic destruction. 
The oxidoreductase enzymes present in the bacteria catalyze several biochemical reactions and 
ultimately led to the cleavage of the complex molecular structure of dye [3]. One of the crucial 
reductive enzymes, azoreductase, breaks down the  azo linkage ( -N=N -) of the chromophore moiety of 
azo dye to produce colorless aromatic amines [10]. Azoreductases are divided into intracellular and 
extracellular, as well as flavin -dependent and flavin -independent categories, based on where they are 
loca ted in the cell membrane, and whether they need a cofactor. The decolorization of several dyes by 
azoreductase has been documented in earlier reports  [11-13]. A detailed explanation of the shift of 
substrate specificity of azoreductase with structural vari ability and relative presence of functional 
groups in dye molecules is given in the literature [14]. In the present study, the production of 
azoreductase from bacterial cultures during dye decolorization is investigated. Partial purification 
and characteri zation of azoreductase are also included in the present study.  
Methodology  
Dyes, bacterial cultures and culture media  
The synthetic dye s used in the current study Acid Maroon V (C.I. Acid Red 119), Methyl Red (C.I. Acid 
Red 2), Remazol  Brilliant Violet 5R (C.I. Reactive Violet 5), Acid Red F2R (C.I. Acid Red 151), Congo 
Red (C.I. C.I. Direct Red 28), Direct Red 12B (C.I. Direct Red 31) and Reactive Red M5B (C.I. Reactive 
Red 2) were procured from the textile industry at Ankleshwar, Guja rat, India. The bacterial cultures 
Enterobacter dissolvens  AGYP1 (GenBank accession number HQ336043) and Pseudomonas  aeruginosa  
AGYP2 (GenBank accession number HQ336042) studied for azoreductase enzyme production were 
isolated from dye -laden soil samples [ 15]. The experiments of decolorization of model dye Acid 
maroon V were executed in Mineral Salt Medium (MSM) containing g l-1: sucrose, 4; NH 4H2PO 4, 0.3; 
K2HPO 4, 6; KH 2PO 4, 1; MgSO 4.7H 2O, 0.1; NaCl, 5; and pH 7±0.2. The Luria Bertani  (LB) broth 
containing g l-1: casein enzymatic hydrolysates, 10; yeast extract, 5; NaCl, 5; and pH, 7±0.2 was used 
for the preparation of bacterial inoculum.  
 
Dye decolorization in liquid media  
The dye removal experiment was carried out using 150 ml MSM su pplemented with dye Acid Maroon 
V (100 mg l-1) in 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks. The individual bacterial cultures at 10% (v/v) inoculum of 
0.5 OD 600 were inoculated into the medium. The flasks were incubated at 30 °C under static 
conditions for color removal.  
 
Intracellular azo reductase estimation  
Preparation of crude extract  
The bacterial cultures were inoculated separately in MSM containing 100 mg l-1Acid Maroon V. After 
decolorization, the flask content was centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 8000 rpm in the refrigerated 
centrifuge (Kubota 6200, Japan). The cell pellet obtained was rinsed thrice with physiological saline 
(0.85% NaCl) followed by 0.1M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7). The washed cell pellet (1 g) was 
mixed with 8 ml of the same buffer and disrupted by ultrasonication in the cold condition for 45 s, 14 
times with 30% outputs (Sonics Vibracell VCX 130 sonicator, USA). The removal of cell debris was 
performed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The c lear supernatant obtained was

considered a crude enzyme source.  
 
Azo reductase assay  
The azoreductase activity was evaluated at 30 °C using a UV -visible spectrophotometer [16]. The 
reaction mixture (1 ml) for the azoreductase  assay contained 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 
7), 24 µM Methyl Red, and an appropriately diluted enzyme solution. Afte r 4 min of pre -incubation at 
30 °C, the assay system was supplemented with 1 mM NADH. The decrease in Methyl Red absorbance 
was me asured at 437 nm. One unit (U) of azoreductase activity was considered as the amount of 
enzyme needed to reduce 1 µM of Methyl Red per min.  
 
Estimation of protein  
The concentration of protein was determined as per Lowry’s method using BSA as a standard.  
 
Partial purification of azoreductase  
Ammonium sulfate precipitation  
The crude extract was mixed with ammonium sulfate and stirred constantly in cold conditions 
throughout 3 h to obtain 0 -60% saturation. The mixture was kept in the refrigerator at 4 °C 
overnight. The resulting precipitates were separated by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 
°C. The precipitates were dissolved in a minimal volume of potassium phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7). 
The supernatant and precipitates were analyzed for azo r eductase activity and protein determination.  
 
Dialysis  
The precipitates obtained by 60% ammonium sulfate precipitation were dissolved in a small volume 
of potassium phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7). The solution was dialyzed using dialysis membrane 150 
(HiM edia) against the large volume of the same buffer for 12 h at 4 °C, with the intermittent change of 
buffer at 4 h intervals.  
 
Characterization of partially purified azoreductase  
Determination of substrate specificity  
The azoreductase activity was determine d using different dyes at an equimolar concentration as 
substrate. The dyes were Methyl Red (molar extinction coefficient 23,360 M-1 cm-1), Acid Maroon V 
(molar extinction coefficient 8,800 M-1 cm-1), Remazol Brilliant Violet 5R (molar extinction coefficie nt 
10,700 M-1 cm-1), Direct Red 12B (molar extinction coefficient 23,660 M-1 cm-1), Acid Red F2R (molar 
extinction coefficient 19,730 M-1 cm-1), Congo Red (Molar extinction coefficient 17,400 M-1 cm-1) and 
Reactive Red M5B (molar extinction coefficient 15, 340 M-1 cm-1).  
 
Determination of optimal pH and temperature  
The azoreductase activity was studied over a wide range of pH (3 to 10) using different buffers (0.1 M 
citrate buffer for pH 3 -5; 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer for pH 6 -8 and 0.1 M glycin -NaOH  buffer 
for pH 9 -10). To assess the effect of temperature, the reaction mixture was incubated at 25 to 55 °C 
temperatures. The enzyme activity was measured as indicated earlier using Methyl Red as substrate.  
 
Effect of metal ions and inhibitors  
The enzyme was pre -incubated with 2 mM of different divalent metals - Mg+2, Ag+2, Mn+2, Cu+2, Fe+2, 
Ca+2, Zn+2, and Hg+2, as well as different concentrations of EDTA and SDS for 30 min at room 
temperature. The residual activity was calculated under standar d assay conditions. The enzyme 
activity without any metal and inhibitor (control) was considered 100%.

Kinetic studies of azoreductase  
The initial velocity of azoreductase was evaluated in the presence of electron donors (NADH, NADPH, 
and FAD). To check  the effect of NADH on azoreductase activity, different concentrations of NADH 
were taken (0.1 to 2 mM) with constant Methyl Red concentration (24 µM). Maximal velocity (V max) 
and Michaelis constants (K m) of azoreductase were determined from a double recip rocal Lineweaver -
Burk plot using variable concentrations of Methyl Red.  
Results and Discussion  
Production and partial purification of azoreductase from bacterial cultures  
In our study intracellular azoreductase  could be produced by both bacterial cultures. The 
azoreductase activity of ED and PA was found to be 119.34±7.4 and 51.58±2.8 U ml-1 respectively 
after Acid Maroon V decolorization under static conditions (Table 1).

Nevertheless, compared to PA, ED showed 2.31 times more enzyme activity. Crude extracts of 
disrupted cells of ED and PA yielded 528.8 and 359 mg of protein, corresponding to 9547.2 and 5158 
units of azoreductase enzyme respectively. After dialysis, azoredu ctase from ED and PA showed 2.86 
and 2.3 fold purification with the recovery of 43% and 39%, respectively. The specific enzyme 
activities of the dialyzed samples were 51.72 U mg-1 protein (ED) and 33.06 U mg-1 protein (PA). The 
results thus displayed a qui te considerable purification and recovery of azoreductase by applying salt 
precipitation and dialysis. Our findings are consistent with other studies that explained how 
intracellular azoreductase activity was induced together with other enzymes during bact erial 
decolorization of textile dyes [1, 5, 11]. The process of biodegradation of azo dyes is often 
commenced with the breakdown of the azo bond by azoreductase resulting in aromatic amines 
formation. Subsequently, the degradation of aromatic amines is med iated by various oxygenases [3]. 
The azoreductase catalyzed cleavage of azo linkage requires four electron transfer reactions in two 
stages, where two electrons are transferred to the azo bond of the dye in each stage [17]. In the 
process of decolorizing d yes, mainly two types of azoreductases - flavin -dependent and flavin -
independent are involved. The flavin -dependent azoreductases are further categorized as NADH only, 
NADPH only, or both depending on coenzymes as electron donors [18]. Most often, anaerobi c bacteria 
are known to produce azoreductase, some aerobic bacteria have also been known  to produce 
intracellular azoreductase [19 -20]. For instance, oxygen -insensitive azoreductase has been found in 
Caulobacter subvibroides  strain C7 -D [13] and Pigmentiph aga kullae  K24 [2].  
 
Characterization of partially purified azoreductase  
Substrate specificity of azoreductase  
Seven different dyes, each at an equimolar concentration were used to assess the azoreductase  
enzyme's selectivity for its substrate. The activity of azoreductase was found with all dyes used as the 
substrate. However, the highest enzyme activity was observed with Methyl Red dye, followed by Acid 
Maroon V (Table 2). This indicated Methyl Red as th e most suitable substrate for the azoreductase 
from both bacterial cultures. The azoreductase of ED and PA showed the least preference for dyes 
Reactive Red M5B and Remazol Brilliant Violet 5R, respectively as substrates. The structural 
complexity of the d yes as well as the characteristics and configuration of the replacing groups in the 
dye molecule may contribute to the diversity in the substrate specificities [21].  Methyl Red is  more

groups. Many researchers have demonstrated substrate preference of the azoreductase to the 
structural diversity of the azo dyes [8, 22 -24]. In one study, when the hydroxyl group was present at 
the para position and ortho position of the naphthol rings of O range I and Orange II respectively, the 
decolorization of such dyes was faster by bacterial azoreductase [14]. Another study claimed that the 
activity of the azoreductase enzyme was inhibited when charged groups and electron -donating 
groups were close to t he azo linkage in the dye. Moreover, the enzyme activity was accelerated in the 
presence of the phenyl group containing electron -withdrawing sulfo (SO 3-) groups [13].  
 
Effect of pH on azoreductase activity  
The influence of pH on the activities of azoreductase from both bacterial cultures was determined in a 
wide range of pH (3 -10). The data shown in Figure 1 demonstrated that the enzyme activity was 
discovered to be pH sensitive, and increased linearly with an increment of pH from 3 to 7.  
 
 
Figur e 1. pH optima of bacteria azoreductase activity  
 
However, maximum enzyme activity was observed at pH 7 for ED (315.58±8.4 U ml-1) and PA 
(161.71±2.7 U ml-1). At extremely acidic and alkaline pHs, the azoreductase activity was considerably 
decreased. In co mparison to optimum pH 7, the enzyme activity was only 23.20 and 9.10% at pH 3,

and 6.29 and 16.83% at pH 10 for ED and PA respectively. Nevertheless, the azoreductase 
from both bacterial cultures was quite stable throughout a wide pH range (pH 4 -9), indi cating 
considerable Ph tolerance. Our results are consistent with earlier studies demonstrating that pH 7 
was ideal for azoreductase activity [25 -26]. In another study, the azoreductase from the bacterial 
consortium had maximum activity at pH 7 than other pH values. An individual member of the 
consortium, Bacillus odyssey , B. thuringiensis , B. subtilis , B. cereus , Alcaligenes  sp., and Nocardiopsis  
alba  also displayed the peak of azoreductase activity at pH 7 [9]. On the other hand, the azoreductase  
enzyme from Rhodobacter sphaeroides  AS1.1737 exhibited its highest level of activity at pH 8 [27]. In 
the previous publication, a variable degree of pH's impact on the azoreductase produced by human 
gut bacteria was described [11]. It is well known that h ighly acidic and alkaline pH leads to 
denaturation of the enzyme, and altered enzyme configuration might not be compatible with its 
substrate. However, in a pH range other than optimum, the enzyme shows activity depending upon 
its type.  
 
Effect of tempera ture on azoreductase activity  
The effect of temperature on the activity of azoreductase from ED and PA was studied in a 
temperature range of 20 to 55 °C. In our study, we found that the optimum temperature for the 
azoreduc tases of both cultures was 30 °C with maximum enzyme activities of 292.36±13.6 and 
152.75±10.1 U ml-1 for ED and PA respectively (Figure 2).  
 
 
 
Figure 2. Temperature optima of bacterial azoreductase  
 
As the temperature rose, there was a fall in enzyme activity. For instance, azoreductase 
activity decreased by 18.74% (ED) and 44.84% (PA) at 55 °C compared to 30 °C. Nevertheless, 
azoreductase from both bacterial cultures was quite stable and active in a broad range of 
temperatures, suggesting its temperature tolerance. A variabl e degree of temperature optima of 
azoreductase has been documented in previous literatures. For instance, at 35 and 45 °C, 
respectively, the azoreductases from Pseudomonas cepacia  [28] and Pigmentiphaga kullae  K24 [2] 
showed their peak activities. On the o ther hand, Bacillus sp. azoreductase activity was found to be 
most effective between 60 and 80 °C [6]. Thermodynamic denaturation of the enzyme protein is 
connected with decreased enzyme activity at higher temperatures [16].

Effect of metal ions and inhib itors on azoreductase activity  
The activities of azoreductase from both bacterial cultures were assessed in the presence of various 
metal ions and inhibitors. The azoreductase activity in the control was assumed to be 100%, and 
residual enzyme activity wa s evaluated after the enzyme was incuba ted for 15 minutes at 30°C with 
metal ions and inhibitors (Table 3). Cu+2, Ag+2, Zn+2, and Hg+2 significantly inhibited the azoreductase 
from ED, whereas Fe+2, Mn+2, and Mg+2 displayed 50 -63% relative activity. However, the enzyme was 
found to be comparatively stable with Ca+2 and retained almost 80% of its activity. Cu+2, Ag+2, Zn+2, 
and Hg+2 caused substantial inhibition of the activity of azoreductase from PA.

Nevertheless, in the presence of Ca+2 and Fe+2, the enzyme showed 56 -61% inhibition.  The 
activity of azoreductase on the other hand was found to be stable (75%) in the presence of Mg+2. 
When EDTA and SDS were used in various concentrations, EDTA was found to be a moderate enzyme 
activity inhibitor.  While SDS at a dosage of 5 mM concentrat ion significantly reduced the activity of 
azoreductase from both bacterial cultures. Our results are consistent with an earlier study in which 
different metal ions and inhibitors were added, and the azoreductase from Bacillus subtilis  showed 
varying degree s of activity [29]. Another study discussed the various effects of me tal ions on the 
activity of the azoreductase  enzyme derived from the bacterial flora DDMZ1 [8]. Based on the binding 
pattern of metal ions to the enzyme protein, both stimulating and inhibitory effect on enzyme activity 
is observed [30]. Cu2+, Ca2+, Mn2+, and Mg2+ were seen to have a stimulating eff ect on enzyme activity 
at lower concentrations [31 -33]. 
 
Effect of electron donors on azoreductase activity  
Azoreductase from a variety of bacteria l sources is found to be flavo protein and NADH/NADPH 
dependent [34 -35]. The impact of several electron donor substances on the activity of azoreductase 
was assessed in our investigation. Among the three electron donors used, the enzyme activity was 
noticeably higher when NADH was present in the system (Table 4). The presence of NADPH and FAD 
displayed 7.75 and 2. 67% activities of azoreductase respectively from ED compared to NADH. In 
comparison to NADH, the azoreductase activity of PA was 8.15 and 6.88% with NADPH and FAD, 
respectively. The above results, therefore, demonstrated NADH as the most suitable electron donor 
for the catalytic activity of azoreductase. An influence of differe nt concentrations of NADH (0.1 -2 mM)

NADH concentration from 0.1 to 1 mM with maximum e nzyme activities of 318.57±4.8 and

azoreductase activity was negatively impacted by further increases in NADH concentration. At 2 mM 
concentration, the enzyme activity was  27.41 and 62.12% for ED and PA, respectively compared to 1 
mM concentration of NADH. Similar findings have been made in the earlier report, which showed that

azoreductase from Enterobacter agglomerans  was NADH dependent for the decolorization of 
Methyl Red [25]. In another report, the activity of azoreductase from Enterococcus faecalis , 
Enterococcus avium , E. coli , and Bacillus cereus  was enhanced with NADH in comparison to NADPH 
[11]. However, NADPH was found to be an efficient electron donor instead of NADH resulting in 1.6 
fold higher activity of Psuedomonas  sp. KF46 azoreductase using Orange -II and Carboxy Orange -II as 
substrates [16].  
 
Kinetic study of bac terial azoreductase  
The azoreductase activity was carried out at variable concentrations of Methyl Red and 1 mM NADH. 
The decolorization of dye by azoreductase improved upon the subsequent increase in Methyl Red 
concentration. The enzyme activity and dye concentration followed a typical Monod -type correlation. 
Michaelis -Menten double reciprocal model system (V max[SMR]/(K m+[S MR])) was used to establish a 
relationship between azoreductase activity (V) and initial Methyl Red concentration ([S MR]). 
According t o Figure 4A, the apparent K m and V max values of the azoreductase from ED were 50 μM and 
2222 U ml-1, respectively, while those of azoreductase from PA were 250 μM and 1000 U ml-1,

respectively (Figure 4B). The specificity constants (V max/K m) of the azoreductases of both the 
cultures were determined and found to be 44.44 and 4 U µM-1 ml-1 for ED and PA respectively. 
According to the aforementioned results, the partially purified azoreductase enzyme operated 
effectively across the entire spectrum of Me thyl Red concentration. In general, it  has been found that 
the enzyme kinetic parameters differ depending on the source, the kind o f substrate employed, and 
other experimental conditions. The K m and V max values of Enterococcus faecalis  azoreductase were 11  
μM

values of azoreductase from Pseudomonas putida  MET9 were reported for different substrates used 
[22].  
Conclusion  
The present study describes the production of azoreductase enzyme from two bacteria l isolates ED 
and PA during bio decolorization  Acid Maroon V dye. The enzyme was successfully partially purified 
after the dialysis process. The azoreductase from both bacterial cultures demonstrated considerable 
stability with a broad range of substrate, pH, temperature, metal ions, and inhibitors. T he 
azoreductase enzyme activity was increased by adding NADH, the best possible electron donor. The 
kinetic parameters revealed the effectiveness of azoreductase over a broad range of Methyl Red 
concentrations. Therefore, the study reveals the potential of  azoreductase from ED and PA in the 
textile dye remediation process.
