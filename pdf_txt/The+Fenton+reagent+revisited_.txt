Fenton’s Reagent Revisited

Received August 30, 1974 
Just 80 years ago H. J. H. Fenton reported1 that 
ferrous ion strongly promotes the oxidation of malic 
acid by hydrogen peroxide. Subsequent work has 
shown that the combination of H202 and a ferrous 
salt, “Fenton’s reagent,” is an effective oxidant of a 
wide variety of organic substrates. 
Forty years later, Haber and Weiss2 proposed that 
the hydroxyl radical is the actual oxidant in such 
systems. In the 1940’s Merz and Waters, in a series 
of elegant papers,3 showed how, using the Haber- 
-Weiss scheme, stoichiometric relations could be em- 
ployed to determine the relative susceptibilities of 
various substrates to hydroxyl radical attack and the 
fate of subsequent radical intermediates. 
Since then the importance and ubiquity of hydrox- 
yl radicals have become increasingly apparent. They 
are major products in the radiation chemistry of 
water, are technically important in many redox poly- 
merizations, and have been suggested as intermedi- 
ates in many other processes. Their gas-phase reac- 
tions are significant in the atmosphere and in the 
chemistry of smog. They are even found widely dis- 
tributed in interstellar space. 
Consequently, hydroxyl radicals have been studied 
with increasing vigor, by means of ever-more-sophis- 
ticated techniques and apparatus. As examples, their 
production by flow systems in an ESR cavity, a 
technique originated by Dixon and N~rman,~ has 
been used to generate a variety of radicals and to 
study both their reactions and the details of their 
ESR spectra. The largest body of data has been sup- 
plied by radiation chemists, who, combining pulse 
radiolysis and competition techniques, have deter- 
mined the absolute rates of hydroxyl radical reac- 
tions with several hundred substrates with varying 
degrees of preci~ion.~ 
In the late 1950’s and 1960’s much of my research 
group’s activities had been concerned with alkoxy 
radical chemistry. In 1969 I decided to include the 
hydroxyl radical in our studies, and took the rather 
anachronistic course of turning back to Fenton’s re- 
agent (which had received only sporadic attention in 
the meantime; in fact the actual participation of hy- 
droxyl radicals in its action had even been thrown 
into question) and the simple stoichiometric analysis 
of Merz and Waters. This Account summarizes our 
Cheves Walling is Distinguished Professor at the University of Utah. 
He received his A.B. from Harvard in 1937 and the Ph.D. from the Uni- 
versity of Chicago in 1939. After 13 years in industry with Du Pont, the 
US Rubber Company (now Uniroyai), and Lever Brothers Company, he 
was appointed Professor of Chemistry at Columbia, and moved to Utah in 
1970. His research has concerned various aspects of physical organic 
chemistry, chiefly free-radical reactions. 
This Account is based on his James Flack Norris Award address, 
given at the April 1971 meeting of the American Chemical Society in Los 
Angeles. Walling says, however, that many of the results described here 
were merely hopes at that time. results and some of the extensions we have been able 
to make to other systems.6 
The Stoichiometry of Fenton’s Reagent; Radical 
Oxidation and Reduction 
In our model (a slightly updated version of the 
Merz and Waters scheme?) a Fenton’s reagent oxida- 
tion involves the following steps (eq 1-6) with k’s (in

tions but, with unsaturated molecules, may be re- 
placed by kinetically equivalent additions. They as- 
sume the possible formation of three types of radi- 
cals, Ria, Rj., and R,., which respectively undergo 
oxidation (and thus regenerate Fe2+ to propagate a 
redox chain), dimerize, or are reduced. The resulting 
stoichiometry may be conveniently investigated by 
adding a small known amount of Hz02 slowly to a 
well-stirred solution containing excess Fe2+ and sub- 
strates and determining the Fe2+ oxidized. k4 Ria + Fe3+ - Fez’ + product

(6) To me, an engaging feature of this project is that almost all experi- 
ments have been carried out with a buret, ordinary laboratory glassware, 
and a GLC analytical unit, aided by a digital integrator (although we have 
used a desk-top computer for data analysis and have carried out some ti- 
trations with a pH-stat). I hope our results give encouragement to investi- 
gators with limited facilities and equipment budgets.

However, (4) is now well established, and should be much faster than (4’) 
under our conditions. 
(8) Our experiments have in general been done with perchlorate salts 
at pH <2 in the absence of 02, which upsets the stoichiometry by reacting 
with the intermediate radicals. When [Fez+] is to be minimized, inverse 
addition (addition of Fez+ to excess H202 + substrate) can be employed 
and may lead to striking changes in product. Wa 11 ing Accounts of Chemical Research 126

isopropyl alcohol, which proved a fortunate choice. 
The resulting plots (Figure I) were invariant with 
[H+], added [Fe3+], total concentrations of reagents, 
and rates of H202 addition, and showed that the al- 
cohol was 6.65 times as reactive as Fe2+ but yielded 
two radicals in a ratio of 7.23:l of which only the 
major one was capable of further oxidation by Fe3+. 
The obvious interpretation, that the major point of 
attack is at C-2, but that some occurs as well on the 
methyl groups, has been confirmed by deuterium 
substitution, product analysis (Table I), and the ef- 
fect of Cu2+ on both stoichiometry and products.l0

behavior of tert-butyl alcohol is particularly striking 
since the 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-propyl radical is oxi- 
dized by Cu2+ but not Fe2+; a small amount of 
Cu2+ completely changes the stoichiometry and 
products; cf. Table I. 
When a substrate belongs to the RkH class, yield- 
ing solely reducible radicals, its presence has no ef- 
fect upon the stoichiometry of the Fe2+-H202 reac- 
tion. However, as again shown by Merz and Waters, 
its reactivity can be determined by measuring its re- 
tarding effect on the chain oxidation of an RiH type 
molecule such as methanol. Under these conditions, 
eq 9 can be put in the form

acetone/methanol reactivity of 0.080. The assump- 
tion that hydroxyl radical attack yields the acetonyl 
radical (eq 12) rather than, e.g., involving addition 
(12) 
to the carbonyl group was shown by the large kinetic 
isotope effect with perdeuterioacetone (kH/kD = 
3.54) and the isolation of small yields of dimer 
(2,5-hexanedione) in inverse addition experiments. 
Subsequently the same technique has been applied 
successfully to other systems and data treatment via 
eq 10 and 11 has been the mainstay of our stoichio- 
metric investigations. 
Accumulating data have clarified the classification 
of radicals in regard to their ease of oxidation and 
reduction. Radicals yielding relatively stable carbo- 
nium ions, e.g., those containing a-OH, a-OR, or 
amide N and tert-alkyl radicals are effectively quan- 
titatively oxidized by Fe3+. Allylic and benzylic rad- 
icals are marginal in that oxidation chain lengths de- 
pend on [Fe3+], so that the clean dichotomy between 
Ri- and Rj. is obscured, while primary and secondary 
alkyl radicals are inert. In contrast, Cu2+ effectively 
oxidizes all these species. Carbonyl conjugated radi- 
cals and similar species with relatively stable corre- 
sponding anions are inert to oxidation by either 
Cu2+ or Fe3+, but are readily reduced by Fe2+ and 
thus belong to class Rk.. Vinyl radicals, obtained by 
hydroxyl radical addition to acetylenes, are unique 
in that they are both oxidized by Cu2+ (but not 
Fe3+) and reduced by Fe2+.11 Thus acetylene yields 
acetaldehyde in the absence of Cu2+ and hydroxy- 
acetaldehyde in its presence (eq 13). HO* + CH3COCH3 - H20 + *CH,COCH,

Thus maleic acid has no effect on the stoichiome- 
try of the Fe2+-H202 reaction and the reduction of 
HzO2 has in effect been “coupled” with the hydra- 
tion of maleic acid. The reactivity of maleic acid can 
be determined by measurement of the inhibition of 
methanol oxidation, but only in the presence of rela- 
tively high concentrations of Fe3+. Otherwise the 
hydroxymethyl radicals from the methanol add to 
the maleic acid to yield, eventually, paraconic acid. 
This sort of process suggests a general synthesis of 
y-lactones, via a redox chain of which we have dem- 
onstrated a few examples.l3

Structure-Reactivity Relations: the Reality of 
Hydroxyl Radicals 
Our data yield not only overall reactivities relative 
to the HO-Fe2+ reaction, k3/k2 (k3 = k3iS ksj + 
123k), but also (sometimes with reasonable assump- 
tions such as that similarly situated methyl groups 
show similar reactivities) a dissection into relative 
rates of attack on different types of C-H bonds 
(Table 11). Overall rates are chiefly of interest for 
comparison with those from radiation chemistry in 
order to validate our reaction scheme, and in general 
our data are in $agreement with radiation results 
within the rather large uncertainty of the latter.l5

However, it should be pointed out that for many 
years an alternative interpretation of the Fe2+-H202 
has existed16 which postulates the step 
H,O~ + Fez+ --+ H,O + Fe0” (16) 
The resulting ferryl radical (Fe02+ or FeOH3+) is 
kinetically equivalent to HO. in all of our reaction 
schemes, although one would have to assume that 
the selectivities of ferryl and hydroxyl were fortui- 
tously almost identical. However, a comparison of 
the relative rates of hydroxyl (or ferryl) radical at- 
tack on Fe2+ and methanol at different perchlorate 
concentrations12 has shown no dependence on ionic 
strength, indicating that the carrier must be an un- 
charged species. Again, ESR spectra of products 
formed in flow systems have also provided a basis for 
doubt that hydroxyl radicals are involved in the Fen- 
ton’s reagent system. With i-PrOH-Hz02-Ti3+, 
Shiga17 reported observing the expected 2-hydroxy- 
-2-propyl radical, but, with Fe2+-EDTA in place of 
Ti3+, the 2-hydroxy-1-propyl radical was found. We 
believe the difference lies in the relative ease of oxi- 
dation of the first radical by Fe(II1). Both radicals 
are produced in each system (the first in much larger 
amounts), but, in the presence of Fe(III), only the 
second survives in sufficient quantity to be seen. 
Similar results with a number of other alcohols and 
ethers can be accounted for in the same way.ls 
If we accept the reality of hydroxyl radicals in our 
systems, Table I1 also gives a good picture of their 
selectivity. For C-H bonds both a and p to OH, the 
usual primary < secondary < tertiary order is ob- 
served, but it is also clear that reactivity is signifi- 
cantly enhanced by potentially electron-donating 
groups (&-OH, a-OR, and amide N) and decreased 
by electronegative substituents (cf. acetic acid, ace- 
tone, halo alcohols). In summary, HO. is only mod- 
erately selective (the full range in our data is a few 
hundred) with reactivity patterns dominated by 
polar effects, a plausible result for a series of strongly 
exothermic reactions of an electronegative radical. 
Although not included in the table, both our re- 
sults and those from radiation chemistry show that 
hydroxyl radical additions to double bonds are also 
very rapid (k’s = 109-1010 or 3 to 30 X k2). In the 
competition between addition and abstraction of al- 
lylic hydrogen €30. thus resembles C1. rather than 
RO. -19 
Mechanisms of Metal Ion-Radical Reactions 
The pattern of metal ion oxidation and reduction 
of radicals disclosed by our work implies significant 
mechanistic conclusions. Oxidation by Fe3+ is selec- 
(15) We have taken the rate of the H0.-Fe2+ reaction as 3 X 108, but 
published results vary from 2.6 X 108 to 5.0 X 108. Dorfman and Adam’s 
review5 shows many similar spreads, although they attempt to indicate 
best values.

(18) ESR spectra respond to concentration, not significance: the species 
observed may range from the major transient species involved in a reaction 
to the most stable minor by-product. 
(19) Alkoxy radicals, RO., are seemingly unique in their preference for 
allylic H abstraction over double bond addition. Although only ad hoc ex- 
planations have been advanced for this property, it makes tert-hutyl hypo- 
chlorite an efficient allylic halogenating agent; cf. C. Walling and W. Thal- 
er, J. Am. Chem. SOC., 83, 3877 (1961). tive, paralleling stabilities of the corresponding car- 
bonium ions, and can be very fast (for eCM20H we 
have estimated 1124 > 4 X 108). In contrast, ligand ex- 
change reactions of Fe3+ have rate constants <IO4. 
Both observations are thus consistent with an outer- 
sphere electron transfer to yield a carbonium ion 
type product. 
R. + Fe3+ R+ + Fez* (17) 
Primary and secondary alkyl radicals are not oxi- 
dized, perhaps because here equilibrium 17 is re- 
versed. Evidence that this is actually the case is the 
observation that solvolysis of ethyl triflate in concen- 
trated Fe(C104)~ solution initiates the polymeriza- 
tion of acrylonitrile and produces signficant oxida- 
tion to Fe3+ and butane f~rmation.~ Radical reduc- 
tions by Fez+ are also very fast20 with an ease paral- 
leling carbanion stability, so it is likely that these 
are outer-sphere electron transfer as well. 
Fez’ + R* ==== Fe3* + R- (18) 
If (17) is reversed for primary and secondary radi- 
cals, Cu2+, a weaker oxidizing agent, can hardly oxi- 
dize them by outer-sphere electron transfer. Rather, 
our data seem consistent with the mechanism pro- 
posed by Kochi involving an intermediate organo- 
copper species which, in our systems, chiefly under- 
goes an internal displacement by ligand-bound water 
to give the hydroxylic products observed.Z1

Oxidations by Cu2.+ appear significantly slower 
than the fastest ones observed with Fe3+, and ligand 
exchange at Cu2+ is rapid enough to permit this sort 
of path. 
Hydroxyl Radical Reactions with Aromatics 
Radiation chemistry results show that hydroxyl 
radicals add very rapidly to aromatics (k’s =: 
109-1010) and the resulting hydroxycyclohexadienyl 
radicals can be observed directly by uv or ESK spec-, 
tro~copy.~ Although for benzene products are clearly 
biphenyl and phenol (from dimerization followed by 
dehydration and from further oxidation of the initial 
addition products), recent work has shown that, with 
substituted benzenes, the overall reactions are much 
more complicated. Thus Kormanz2 finds that ESR 
spectra are pH dependent and indicate both hydrox- 
ylation and side-chain cleavage, while Hamiltonz3 
has suggested that the initial reaction may be elec- 
tron transfer to yield an aromatic radical cation 
rather than addition. 
A study by R. A. Johnsonz4 of product distribu- 
tions for several aromatics under a variety of condi- 
tions confirms this complexity and appears consis-

Table I11 shows typical data on which the scheme is 
based. We assume that hydroxyl radical attack is 
predominantly by addition, but that the initial mix- 
ture of hydroxycyclohexadienyl radicals (A) suffers a 
rapid, reversible, and acid-catalyzed collapse to radi- 
cal cation B which undergoes competitive reduction 
back to starting material by Fez+ and side-chain 
cleavage to benzyl radicals C. These, in turn dimer- 
ize to bibenzyl, or, in the presence of Cu2+ or Fe3+, 
are oxidized to benzyl alcohol. At high oxidant levels 
A is largely trapped by oxidation to phenols, con- 
vincing evidence that it is the major initial product. 
Here a notable feature is that Cu2+ and 02 yield 
much more meta isomer than does Fe3+. We believe 
that Cu2+ and 02 give the isomer distribution typi- 
cal of A (i.e., somewhere between that determined 
by initial HO. attack and equilibration). On the 
other hand, Fe3+, an electron-transfer oxidant, may 
be more selective, reacting chiefly with ortho-para 
isomers which yield more stable carbonium ions. 
Further, if the meta carbonium ion is produced; it 
offers the possibility of further rearrangement, e.g.

Whether such a protonated epoxide is a real inter- 
mediate in equilibrium with the epoxide is unknown, 
but it is pertinent that acid-catalyzed opening of 
such epoxides of alkylbenzenes give exclusively 
ortho- and para-substituted phenols.25

high selectivities to specific products can be ob- 
tained: 81% to bibenzyl with no added oxidant; 82% 
to benzyl alcohol at high [Fe3+], 94% to phenols at 
low [H+] and high [Cu2+]. Toluene behaves quite 
similarly, and even benzyl and a- and P-phenylethyl 
alcohols, which Hamilton reports to give solely 
cleavage products, yield 21-40% phenols in the pres- 
ence of CU~+. With benzene, where there is no possi- 
bility of cleavage, total product yields are pH depen- 
dent since in strong acid most of the hydroxycyclo- 
hexadienyl radicals collapse to radical cations and 
are reduced back to starting material.26 
Recently we have extended our studies to the 
Sz082--Fe2+ system.27 Here side-chain cleavage 
reactions are well known, but we find that benzene, 
toluene, and even P-phenylethyl alcohol in the pres- 
ence of Cu2+ give yields of phenols comparable to 
those obtained with H202. Aryl sulfates are not in- 
termediates (since they are stable under these condi- 
tions but not detected), so our results support the 
reversibility of the A + B equilibrium in (20), and

(26) On the basis of ESR spectra A. L. Buley, R. 0. C. Norman, and R. 
J. Prichett, J. Chem. Soc. B, 849 (19661, have proposed an analog to this 
behavior of hydroxycyclohexadienyl radicals in aliphatic systems 
where X is OH or another suitable leaving group. We have confirmed this 
interesting process by both stoichiometric and product studies. Thus Fen- 
ton's reagent isomerizes 2,3-dihydroxybutane to 2-butanone (R. A. John- 
son, unpublished work).

Whether the so4.- radical adds to the aromatic and 
is then lost as so42- or oxidizes the aromatic direct- 
ly by electron transfer is still obscure. 
While most of the steps in our reaction scheme are 
not new, our data draw them into a more coherent 
whole and show how aromatic hydroxylation can be 
made to yield a variety of products in a predictable 
manner and in encouraging high yield. In fact, the 
extreme sensitivity of product distributions to condi- 
tions suggests that many previous conclusions (based 
on such distributions) about the intermediacy or 
nonintermediacy of hydroxyl radicals in metal ion 
induced oxidations or aromatics need reexamination.

composition by Fe3 + in dilute acid solution The long-known catalysis of hydrogen peroxide de- 
is an important process in which the role of hydroxyl 
radicals has been in dispute. Kremer and Stein28 
have proposed a nonradical, nonchain sequence (eq

Barb, Baxendale, George, and Hargra~e.~~ The pos-

so that the termination step (eq 30) is effectively the 
reverse of the second part of (31). Both schemes pre- 
dict rates proportional to [H202][Fe3+]/[H+] at high 
[HzOz]/ [Fe3+] ratios (as observed) and deviations at 
lower ratios which have been in some dispute. 
Various organic substrates were known to retard 
the decomposition, and it occurred to us that, if the 
Barb and Baxendale scheme were correct, retarda- 
tion could be because the substrates were acting as 
hydroxyl radical traps and introducing a new termi- 
nation sequence

From (35-36) retarded reactions should again be first 
order in [Fe3+] and [H202] but with hobsd linear in 
[H202]/[RH] and extrapolating to 2h24 for H202 
disappearance and zero (with half as large a slope) 
for 02 evolution. A. Goosen30 has shown that such 
behavior is actually obeyed, first with acetone (Fig- 
ure 3) and then with acetic acid and tert-butyl alco- 
hol. Gratifyingly, all systems yielded similar k24'S as 
required and slopes satisfactorily close to those pre- 
dicted from values of k26 and k31 taken from radia- 
tion results or our own measurements with Fenton's 
reagent. Further analysis showed that kinetic chains 
in the unretarded reaction were approximately 30 (a 
more plausible value than Barb's much larger earlier 
estimate) and gave a value of k27 in good agreement 
with radiation results. Since these results would be 
very hard to account for in a "complex" scheme such 
as (25), the redox chain mechanism seems firmly es- 
tablished.31 
However, it should be noted that some substrates 
give more complex results. Methanol retards the de- 
composition and yields plots similar to Figure 3, but

(31) An original objection to the Barb et al. scheme, the behavior of the 
Fe3+--Hz02 system at high [Fe3+]/[H202] ratios, has also been removed by 
showing that data are actually consistent with behavior predicted by nu- 
merical integration of the complete differential equations (C. Walling and 
T. Weil, Int. J. Chem. Kinetics, 6,507 (1974)). Vol. 8, 1975 Fenton’s Reagent Revisited 131 
the slopes indicate that it is a much less effective re- 
tarder than would be calculated from its reactivity 
toward hydroxyl radicals. Presumably here some of 
the resulting hydroxymethyl radicals are reoxidized 
by Fe3+ rather than reacting with 02 and thus prop- 
agate the redox chain. 
A number of complexed ferric ions also catalyze 
the decomposition of H202, and we are applying our 
techniques to the study of these systems. Fe(I1- 
1)-EDTA forms an intensely purple complex with 
HzOz at pH 8 and above. 
[Fe*EDTA*OH]’‘ + HzOz == 
[F~oEDTA.~,]~’ + H,O + H+ (37) 
The complex has not been isolated, but some time 
we showed that, in the pH region where the 
complex is formed, Fe(II1)-EDTA is a catalyst both 
for the decomposition of H202 and the oxidation of 
organic substrates (including bound and free 
EDTA). Kinetics were complex, and the reaction 
was retarded by both excess EDTA and other sub- 
strates. We have recently reexamined this 
and, with acetone and tert-butyl alcohol, obtain 
plots similar to Figure 3 with similar intercepts for 
the two substrates and slopes inversely proportional 
to their reactivities toward HO.. However, total re- 
tardations are small and actual slopes indicate lower 
reactivities for the substrates than would be calcu- 
lated. A plausible explanation of this finding lies in 
the very high reactivity of EDTA (lz = 2.76 X 
and presumably its complexes toward hydroxyl radi- 
cals. Our structure-reactivity studies indicate the 
chief point of attack should be the ethylene bridge, 
to yield a very easily oxidized radical, i.e. 
+/ C=N 
/ - CH,-N \ CH, -N / .CH,-N\ / ox HO. + CHZ-N\ 
\ > (38) 
\ I /-I CH2-N 
so that (38) as well as (28) could at least partially 
propagate the chain as in the case of methanol. At- 
tack on an Fe(II1)-EDTA complex would give a 
product containing its own oxidant, so that the two 
steps of (38) might be almost concerted. Finally, the 
high rate of the HO- + Fe(II1)-EDTA reaction 
makes it likely that some fraction of the process is 
actually a cage reaction between freshly generated 
HO- and Fe(II1)-EDTA pairs. These considerations 
predict very complex overall kinetics, but assuming 
that chain propagation is via both (28) and (38) 
gives calculated slopes in substantial agreement with 
experiment. 
Some other ferric complexes give similar results. 
The nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) complex is a catalyst 
for H202 decomposition above pH 5 (although no 
spectroscopically demonstrable H202 complex is ob- 
served), and again tert-butyl alcohol and acetone 
strongly retard the decomposition, with tert-butyl

Chem., 4,31 (1972). alcohol being considerably more effective. Similarly, 
at pH 9, acetone retards the decomposition of H202 
by hemin. At this point our results suggest that hy- 
droxyl radical chains may provide quite a general 
path for transition metal catalyzed decompositions 
of H202, and I propose that strong retardation of any 
such decomposition by organic substrates which are 
good HO. traps (particularly when the effect of sev- 
eral substrates parallel their expected reactivities 
and extrapolate to the same completely retarded 
rate) providesprima facia evidence for such a path. 
Extensions 
The systems which we have examined to date are 
part of a much larger whole of great technical and 
biochemical interest: the entire set of processes in 
which 02, H202, and peroxides oxidize organic sub- 
strates under the mediation of transition metal ions 
and complexes. A primary question is: in which of 
these are simple oxygen radicals (HO., RO., HO2., 
etc.) the reactive transients, and in which are metal 
oxygen complexes (e.g., the ferry1 ion, Fe02+) in- 
volved?2 Although it has been popular to invoke 
some example of the latter group, suitably tailored 
to fit the data, to explain a variety of phenomena,35 
this seems to me an unnecessary hypothesis if simple 
oxygen radicals adequately account for the results, 
and in several systems we have now shown this to be 
the case. 
As the properties of the oxygen radicals become 
better characterized, this approach can be extended. 
As possible examples, Dearden, Jefcoate, and Lind- 
say-Smith36 have described the hydroxylation of tol- 
uene and anisole induced by the autoxidation of var- 
ious complexes of Fe(II), Ti(III), Cu(I), and Sn(II), 
but discounted a hydroxyl radical mechanism be- 
cause of the variability of the isomer distributions 
observed. However, as we and others have shown, 
wide variability is now plainly possible for the hy- 
droxyl radical reaction. 
Finally, and much more speculatively, biochemists 
have been reluctant to consider hydroxyl radicals as 
intermediates in enzymic hydroxylations because of 
their high and indiscriminate rea~tivity.~~ However, 
since their fastest reactions are diffusion controlled, 
it is conceivable that a system might generate a hy- 
droxyl radical in juxtaposition to an absorbed sub- 
strate, and then immediately convert the resulting 
radical to stable product by oxidation by a suitably 
positioned metal ion (possibly just oxidized in the 
H0.-forming process). 
Many of the ideas and all of the experimental results described 
here are those of my coworkers whose names are given in the ref- 
erences and without whom this work would have been impossible. 
I also thank the Petroleum Research Fund, administered by the 
American Chemical Society, the National Science Foundation, 
and the University of Utah for support of these investigations. 
(35) The formulation of “complexes” to explain reactions and kinetic 
data is a great temptation but, particularly when they cannot be indepen- 
dently demonstrated, has little more intellectual justification than invok- 
ing malignant spirits. However, since suitable complexes can fit almost any 
data, the temptation is real, and I have done it myself.

(37) Since such formulations imply a high hydroxyl radical flux in one’s 
liver, their reluctance has been understandable.
