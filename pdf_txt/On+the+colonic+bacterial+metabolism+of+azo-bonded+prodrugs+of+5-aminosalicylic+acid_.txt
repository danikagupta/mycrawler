ABSTRACT
The human gut is home to trillions of microorganisms that are re-
sponsible for the modification of many orally administered drugs,leading to a wide range of therapeutic outcomes. Prodrugs bearingan azo bond are designed to treat inflammatory bowel disease and
colorectal cancer via microbial azo reduction, allowing for topical
application of therapeutic moieties to the diseased tissue in the in-testines. Despite the inextricable link between microbial azo reduc-
tion and the efficacy of azo prodrugs, the prevalence, abundance,
and distribution of azoreductases have not been systematically ex-amined across the gut microbiome. Here, we curated and clustered
amino acid sequences of experimentally confirmed bacterial azore-
ductases and conducted a hidden Markov model –driven homolog
search for these enzymes across 4644 genome sequences present
in the representative Unified Human Gastrointestinal Genomes col-
lection. We identified 1958 putative azo-reducing species, corroborat-
ing previous findings that azo reduction appears to be a ubiquitousfunction of the gut microbiome. However, through a systematiccomparison of predicted and confirmed azo-reducing strains, we hy-pothesize the presence of uncharacterized azoreductases in 25 promi-nent strains of the human gut microbiome. Finally, we confirmed theazo reduction of Acid Orange 7 by multiple strains of Fusobacterium
nucleatum, Bacteroides fragilis ,a n d Clostridium clostridioforme .T o -
gether, these results suggest the presence and activity of many un-characterized azoreductases in the human gut microbiome and
motivate future studies aimed at characterizing azoreductase genes in
prominent members of the human gut microbiome.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
This work systematically examined the prevalence, abundance,
and distribution of azoreductases across the healthy and inflam-
matory bowel disease human gut microbiome, revealing potentially
uncharacterized azoreductase genes. It also confirmed the reduc-tion of Acid Orange 7 by strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum,
Bacteroides fragilis , and Clostridium clostridioforme .
Introduction
Orally administered drugs are an attractive, noninvasive mode of de-
livery of pharmaceuticals to the intestines. The human gut microbiome
plays an important role in drug metabolism (Spanogiannopoulos et al.,
2016) and is capable of activating (Peppercorn and Goldman, 1972;
Morrison et al., 2012; Sousa et al., 2014), inactivating (Peters, 1978;Saha et al., 1983; Haiser et al., 2013), and even toxifying (Wallace
et al., 2010) pharmaceutical drugs. Prodrugs containing an azo bond ac-tually require bacterial azoreductase activity to release biologically ac-tive compounds (Peppercorn and Goldman, 1972). For conditions suchas inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC), bac-
terial azoreductases have been used to deliver therapeutics such as
5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), prednisolone (Ruiz et al., 2011), and cel-
ecoxib (Ruiz et al., 2011) topically to diseased intestinal tissues (Fig. 1).Following oral administration of sulfasalazine, bacterial azoreductases inthe gut reduce azo bonds, liberating 5-ASA and allowing it to confer itsanti-in ﬂammatory properties (Mahida et al., 1991; Rachmilewitz et al.,
1992; Weber et al., 2000) topically on inﬂ amed intestinal tissue. Direct oral
administration of 5-ASA is nonoptimal because the majority of the drug isabsorbed in the small intestine and is sent through systemic circulation(Peppercorn and Goldman, 1973; Tozaki et al., 2002; Friend, 2005;Perrotta et al., 2015; Foppoli et al., 2019). Other examples of azo-bondedprodrugs are OPN501 and celecoxib-5-ASA. OPN501 is made of up pred-nisolone, 5-ASA, and an inert cyclization product, dihydroquinolone

(DHQ). Upon azo reduction, 5-ASA is released and is able to act topically
upon the target tissue. Following a spontaneous cyclization reaction, pred-nisolone and DHQ are released where prednisolone can act upon the targettissue (Ruiz et al., 2011). Celecoxib-5-ASA is made up of celecoxib,5-ASA, and DHQ, which are all released upon azo reduction and cycliza-tion in a similar mechanistic fashion to OPN501 (Ruiz et al., 2011).
A recent review article by Suzuki (2019) collected and curated exper-
imentally conﬁ rmed azoreductases and described their preferred ﬂavin
cofactors and electron donors. They found that bacterial azoreductasesqualitatively cluster into four main clades, which harbor a preferencefor either ﬂavin mononucleotide (FMN) or ﬂavin adenine dinucleotide
as the ﬂavin cofactor and either NADH or NADPH as the preferredelectron donor. Clades I, II, and III are ﬂavoproteins, whereas clade IV
proteins are ﬂavin free. Clade I azoreductases prefer NADPH as the
electron donor, clade II prefers NADH as its electron donor, and clades
III and IV generally use both. Of the 37 enzymes examined by Suzuki(2019), eight enzymes formed no distinct phylogenetic clade and fea-
tured differences in primary sequence length, ﬂavin cofactor, and pre-
ferred electron donor. In addition to their relevance in drug delivery and
efﬁcacy, azoreductases are involved in nitroreduction (Brown 1981;

tries, and waste from their production and usage pollutes the environment.
This has led to a plethora of manuscripts characterizing the activity ofazoreductases across the bacterial kingdom (Cerniglia et al., 1982; Zim-
mermann et al., 1982; Nakanishi et al., 2001; Suzuki et al., 2001; Bl €umel
et al., 2002; Bl €umel and Stolz, 2003; Chen et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2005;

et al., 2014; Eslami et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016), many of which ex-
hibit nonnegligible sequence similarity to gut microbial azoreductases
(Suzuki 2019).
There is a growing body of literature suggesting that azo reduction is
a ubiquitous function of the human gut microbiome (Javdan et al.,
2020), with many prominent bacterial strains showing signi ﬁcant reduc-
tion of sulfasalazine in vitro (Zimmermann et al., 2019). Javdan et al.(2020) showed that among 20 different individuals, sulfasalazine reduc-
tion was one of the only ubiquitous functions of the gut microbiome.
Zimmermann et al. (2019) tested the reduction of sulfasalazine by
76 prominent strains of the gut microbiome and reported a signi ﬁcant
[false discover rate (FDR) adjusted Pvalue < 0.05] reduction of sulfasa-
lazine by 62 of these strains. Interestingly, some of these experimentallyconﬁrmed azo-reducing strains reported by Zimmermann et al. (2019)
have no prior evidence of azo-reduction and, thus, may encode novel oruncharacterized azoreductase genes (Fig. 1C). Identi ﬁcation of known
azoreductases in newly reported sulfasalazine-reducing species can helpnarrow down strains to target for identi ﬁcation of uncharacterized
azoreductases.
The prevalence, abundance, expression, and distribution of azoreduc-
tase enzymes in the human gut microbiome have implications for theefﬁcacy of existing pr odrugs mentioned above, as well as for the devel-
opment of future azo prodrugs. Although azoreductases have been iden-tiﬁed and characterized in many gut bacteria (Supplemental Table 1),
the distribution of azoreductases has not been systematically exploredacross current gut bacterial reference genomes. To address this gap, we
conducted a homolog search of known azoreductases across the Uni ﬁed
Human Gastrointestinal Genomes (UHGG) collection (Almeida et al.,
2020) to identify putative azoreductases and azo-reducing species in the
human gut microbiome. We then assessed the relative abundance and
expression of known azoreductases in healthy, ulcerative colitis (UC),
and Crohn disease (CD) participants of the Integrative Human Micro-
biome Project (HMP2) (Proctor and Huttenhower, 2019), the Prospec-
tive Registry of IBD Patients at MGH (PRISM) (Franzosa et al., 2019),
and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS) (Abu-Ali et al.,
2018). Finally, we tested the in vitro azo reduction of Acid
Orange 7 by three strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum along with
two strains of Bacteroides fragilis and two strains of Clostridium
clostridioforme .

Data. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing data obtained from the HMP2 [N (sam-
ples)5703, N (individuals) 5103] (Proctor and Huttenhower, 2019), the
PRISM [N (samples) 5218, N (individuals) 5218] (Franzosa et al., 2019), and
the HPFS [N (samples) 5220, N (individuals) 5220] (Abu-Ali et al., 2018) are
used throughout this work. Note that all samples referred to throughout this work
are human stool samples.
Curation of Hidden Markov Models Representing Azoreductase
Enzymes. We searched the literature for known and experimentally validated
species of bacteria that have azoreductase activity. The list of gene sequencescollected, along with the relevant metadata (organism, functional annotation,length, etc.) is available in Supplemental Table 1. Preliminary evidence forazoreductase gene sequence clustering is shown in Suzuki (2019), where sequen-ces were aligned and phylogenetically compared. Next, after collecting 40 se-
quences of experimentally validated azoreductases, we generated a sequencesimilarity network using the Enzyme Function Initiative-Enzyme Similarity Tool(EFI-EST) (Gerlt et al., 2015) at a 35% amino acid sequence iden tity threshold for
identifying similar clusters of azoreductase genes. This threshold corroborates the
preliminary evidence for a diversity of azoreductase sequences put forth by Suzuki
(2019). With the exception of clade IVb sequences, which reached 31% sequenceidentity, all other clusters of genes had at least 35% sequence identity. The groupss h o w ni nF i g .2w e r ep r e s s e di n t op r o ﬁle hidden Markov models (HMMs) using

Search for Azoreductase Genes across Human Gut Microbial
Genomes. We searched HMMs of known, experimentally validated azoreduc-
tases across 4644 nonredundant genomes contained in the UHGG collection(Almeida et al., 2020) using HMMER v3.1b2 (Finn et al., 2015). Alignments to

/C010and 60% coverage of the query
sequence were labeled as putative azoreductase gene sequences. Putative azo-
reducing bacterial species with experimentally con ﬁrmed azoreductase activity
(Supplemental Table 2) were then labeled as “known ”azo-reducing species
and classi ﬁed separately from the putative azo-reducing species. Putative azo-
reducing species across the bacterial taxonomy were visualized using the iTOL
web interface (Letunic and Bork, 2019), and prominent phyla of the gut micro-biome were subsetted and presented in Fig. 3.
Relative Abundance and Azoreductase Gene Abundance and Expres-
sion Estimation. Raw sequencing reads for samples from HMP2 (Proctor and
Huttenhower, 2019), PRISM (Franzosa et al., 2019), and HPFS (Abu-Ali et al.,2018) were downloaded and extracted with the National Center for Biotechnol-ogy Information’ s SRA toolkit v2.10.9 (http://ncbi.github.io/sra-tools/). Quality
control and adapter trimming of the fastq sequence ﬁles were done with the
Trim Galore wrapper v0.6.6 (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/
trim_galore/). To remove potential human contaminants, quality trimmed reads
were screened against the human genome (hg19) with Bowtie2 v2.4.2 (Langmeadand Salzberg, 2012). Putative azoreductase sequences were extracted from UHGGgenomes via custom shell and python scripts. Putative azoreductase gene sequen-
ces (HMP2, PRISM) and expression levels (HPFS) were quantiﬁ ed using salmon
v1.4.0 (Patro et al., 2017) and were normalized and aggregated in R v4.1.1 and
were subsequently visualized using the R package ggplot2 (Wickham, 2011) (Fig.4). Taxonomy proﬁ ling of the cleaned metagenomic reads from HMP2 samples
was performed using Kraken 2 v2.0.8-beta (Wood et al., 2019) to estimate the rela-
tive abundance of bacterial species present in each data set. These relative abundan-
ces were then processed in R v4.1.1 and plotted using ggplot2 (Fig. 5). All
computational and bioinformatic procedures are open source and are provided athttps://github.com/dombr accia/Azoreductases.
Statistical Analysis of Relative Metagenomic Sequence Data from
HMP2 and PRISM Datasets. Statistical analyses described in Fig. 4 were per-
formed in R 4.1.1 with the Wilcoxon test method using default parameterization.Next, we compared the relative abundances of known and putative azo-reducingspecies for HMP2 subjects with 20 or more stool samples taken over the courseof the study (Fig. 5). A linear mixed-effects model ANOVA was performed on
this subset of HMP2 data to determine any statistically signiﬁ cant differences in
relative abundance values across non-IBD, UC, and CD subjects. The R package
lme4 (Bates et al., 2014) was used to ﬁt the model to the data, and the package
lmerTest (Kuznetsova et al., 2017) was used to perform the ANOVA on themodel. All statistical analyses were performed in R version 4.1.1 and are pro-
vided at https://github.com/dombraccia/Azoreductases.
Acid Orange 7 Azo Reduction Assay. Biologic triplicates were grown in a
10 ml tube containing 10 ml of Yeast Casitone Fatty Acids (YCFA) broth for B.
fragilis andC. clostridioforme strains and 10 ml of Brain Heart Infusion (BHI)
broth for F. nucleatum strains. Each tube was inoculated with 10 mLo fb a c t e r i a
from glycerol stocks. The ﬁnal concentrations of each substrate in the bacterial
cultures were 50 mg/ml of FMN, 50 mg/ml of NADH, and 50 mmol/ml of Acid
Orange 7. The bacterial cultures were left to grow in an anaerobic chamber for
72 hours, and Acid Orange 7 decolorization was measured once every 24 hourssince inoculation. The decolorization of Acid Orange 7 was measured by aliquot-ing triplicates of 200 mL media aliquants to a 96-well plate for each bacterial cul-
ture, and absorbance of 550 nm light was measured using a spectrophotometer.144 Braccia et al. at ASPET Journals on August 29, 2024 dmd.aspetjournals.org Downloaded from The raw absorbance values for each biologic and technical replicate are reported

Results
Primary Amino Acid Sequences of Bacterial Azoreductases
Group by Mechanistic Preferences. To begin identifying putative
azo-reducing species of the gut microbiome, we searched the literature
for experimentally veri ﬁed azoreductase enzymes, collected amino acid
sequences, and metadata for these azoreductases (Supplemental Table 1)and compared their primary sequences using the EFI-EST (Gerlt et al.,2015). The resulting sequence similarity network captured mechanisticpreferences such as ﬂavin dependence and electron donor preference for
each azoreductase reported by Suzuki (2019). We saw near-complete con-cordance between the clade I –IV azoreductases and the sequence similarity
clusters at a 35% amino acid identity edge threshold, with the exceptionof clade IV, which was split into two separate clusters (Fig. 2). The gene
families labeled arsH, mdaB, yieF, and azo1 clustered separately from
clade I –IV azoreductases, and we consider each of these clusters as sepa-
rate subfamilies of azoreductases. Multiple sequence alignments were gen-erated for each cluster shown in Fig. 2 (with the exception of the “Other
Azoreductases ”group) using MUSCLE v3.8.425 (Edgar, 2004). HMMs
were then trained on the multiple sequence alignments from the previousstep using the HMMER v3.1b2 method hmmpress (Finn et al., 2015) and
were queried against the UHGG collection (Almeida et al., 2020).
Homolog Search for Azoreductases Supports Evidence for
Ubiquity of Azo Reduction by the Human Gut Microbiome. We
searched for homologs of azoreductases across 4644 representative ge-nomes in the UHGG collection (Almeida et al., 2020) using HMMsgenerated from sequences of experimentally validated azoreductase en-zymes (Fig. 3). This collection contains 204,938 genome sequences ofbacteria known to inhabit the human gut, of which 4644 are included inthe representative collection (Supplemental Table 4). For the remainderof this work, we refer to species receiving statistically signi ﬁcant
( E - v a l u e<1×1 0
/C010) hits to azoreductase genes as “putative azo-reducing
species ”or“putative azo-reducing bacteria. ”Of the 4644 genomes in the
UHGG collection, there are 1443 (31.1%) with one putative azoreductasegene, 343 (7.4%) with two or more putative azoreductases, and 372(8.0%) with three or more putative azoreductases, indicating the extensive
potential of the gut microbiome to reduce azo bonds. Most notably, 364
genomes contain hits to the clade I pro ﬁle, 452 contain hits to the clade II
proﬁle, 793 genomes contain hits to the clade III proﬁ le, 568 contain hits
to the clade IVa pro ﬁle, 410 contain hits to the clade IVb proﬁ le, 285
contain hits to the mdaB proﬁle, and 477 contain hits to the yieF proﬁle.
Prominent phyla of the gut microbiome, such as Proteobacteria and
Firmicutes , appear particularly rich with clade I, clade II, clade III, clade
Fig. 2. Bacterial azoreductases cluster by cofactor and electron donor preferences. Following an extensive literature search for experimentally confirmed bacterial azor-
eductases, amino acid sequences of 40 azoreductase enzymes were collected and clustered with EFI-EST (Gerlt et al., 2015) at 35% sequence identity. Each node in
the figure above is a single azoreductase gene, and the edges between nodes indicate at least 35% sequence identity between the two amino acid sequences. The col-
ored clusters, clade I through clade IVa and IVb, are groups of azoreductases previously described by Suzuki (2019) as mechanistically similar groups based on cofac-
tor and electron donor preferences. Clusters labeled with gene names ( mdaB ,yieF, etc.) represent homologous gene sequences found in two or more organisms. Each
mechanistically characterized group of azoreductases were subsequently pressed into profile HMMs using HMMER v3.1b2 (Finn et al., 2015), which formed the basis
of the homolog search. The group labeled “other azoreductases ”contains sequences that did not fall into any cluster at the 35% identity threshold and were pressed
into singular HMMs prior to the homolog search.Prediction of Uncharacterized Azo Reduction by the Gut Microbiome 145 at ASPET Journals on August 29, 2024 dmd.aspetjournals.org Downloaded from IVab, and ﬂavin adenine dinucleotide utilizing azoreductases (purple col-

Systematic Evaluation of Predicted Azo-Reducing Species. We
next sought to evaluate the results of our azoreductase homolog search
with recent ﬁndings by Zimmermann et al. (2019) regarding sulfasalazine
reduction. Zimmermann et al. (2019) tested the degradation of sulfasala-zine by 76 prominent gut bacterial strains, 67 of which had correspondingreference genomes present in the UHGG collection. This provided an ex-cellent source of data to compare our bioinformatic predictions against.We determined the sulfasalazine-reducing status as either sulfasalazine re-ducing (SR) or non –sulfasalazine reducing for each of the 67 strains
b a s e do nt h es i g n i ﬁcant (FDR adjusted Pvalue < 0.05) reduction ofsulfasalazine in vitro reported by Zimmermann et al. (2019) (Table 1).We also determined the predicted reducing status as either a predicted re-ducer (PR) or a non –predicted reducer (Non-PR) for each strain based on
the presence of a putative azoreductase identiﬁ ed from the homolog
search step. For each strain, the sulfasalazine-reducing status and pre-dicted reducing status were systematically compared to validate the re-sults of the azoreductase homolog search (Table 1, columns 7 –9). We
correctly predicted the sulfasalazine-reducing status for 47.8% (32/67) ofstrains and we incorrectly predicted the sulfasalazine reducing status for52.2% (35/67) of strains (Table 2). The vast majority (77.1%, 27/35) ofincorrectly predicted strains are false negatives, meaning the strain doesreduce sulfasalazine in vitro, but we did not identify an azoreductase in

The taxonomic tree is obtained from the UHGG (Almeida et al., 2020) which is built on the Genome Taxonomy Database (Chaumeil et al., 2019). Phyla names are
annotated on the left side. Phyla names followed by a capital letter, e.g., Firmicutes (A), indicate a novel phylum classified by the Genome Taxonomy Database tool-
kit. The bar chart in the center indicates the number of species contained in each genus shown in the tree. The size of the circles indicates the number of species that
contain hits to the azoreductase genes specified. The color of the circles indicates the cofactor and preferred electron ( e-) donor of the enzyme.146 Braccia et al. at ASPET Journals on August 29, 2024 dmd.aspetjournals.org Downloaded from the homolog search step (Table 2). Interestingly, the majority of false
positives (75%, 6/8) are members of the Proteobacteria phylum, whichwe previously noted to be particularly rich in azoreductase gene sequen-
ces (Fig. 3).
Exploratory Analysis of Azoreductase Abundance and Ex-
pression Levels in the Human Gut Microbiome. After identifying
putative azo-reducing species of the human gut microbiome, we next
sought to examine the abundance and expression of putative azoreduc-tases using publicly available metagenomic and metatranscriptomicdatasets. We used shotgun metagenomic sequence data from the HMP2
(Proctor and Huttenhower, 2019) and the PRISM (Franzosa et al.,
2019) to quantify azoreductase gene abundance. We also used high-throughput metatranscriptomic sequence data from the HPFS (Abu-Ali
et al., 2018) to quantify the expression of azoreductases by the human
gut microbiota (Fig. 4, A– C). Brie ﬂy, raw genomic and transcriptomic
reads were ﬁltered and processed using fastp (Chen et al., 2018), andazoreductases were quanti ﬁed using salmon v1.4.0 (Patro et al., 2017).
Please see Materials and Methods for more details on the computational
and statistical procedures used.
Signiﬁcant differences in azoreductase gene abundances between dis-
ease conditions are displayed in Fig. 4, A and B with asterisks. We ﬁnd
that clade I, clade II, clade III, clade IVa, clade IVb, mdaB, and yieF
genes are considerably higher in abundance than ferB, azoR1_cperf,

is higher in abundance than all other azoreductases across healthy, UC,and CD cohorts from HMP2 (Fig. 4A), but the same statistically signi ﬁ-
cant difference was not observed in the PRISM study (Fig. 4B).

Please see Materials and Methods for a more detailed description of the computational and statistical methods employed.Prediction of Uncharacterized Azo Reduction by the Gut Microbiome 147 at ASPET Journals on August 29, 2024 dmd.aspetjournals.org Downloaded from in healthy individuals (minimum FDR adjusted Pvalue < 1 × 10/C07between
mdaB and azoR1_cperf) (Fig. 4C). Although clade IVb abundance levels
are comparable to those of clades I, II, III, and IVa, the expression levels of
clade IVb azoreductases are signi ﬁcantly lower in vivo than the expression
clade I, II, III, and IVa azoreductases (all FDR adjusted P<2 . 2×1 0/C016).
The Relative Abundance of Putative Azo-Reducing Species
Fluctuates over Time. We next sought to examine whether relative
abundance levels of combined known and putative azo-reducing species
are stable or ﬂuctuate over time. The HMP2 dataset provides a unique
opportunity to examine the stability of individuals ’gut microbiomes over
time as there are 18 individuals across healthy, UC, and CD cohorts, withat least 20 stool samples taken once every 2 weeks over a 6-month pe-
riod. To examine the stability of azo reduction in the human gut, we com-pared the relative abundance of known and putative azo-reducing speciesfrom these participants (Fig. 5). The median relative abundance of com-
bined azo-reducing species ranges from 20.3 ± 3.58% to 33.9 ± 19.2%
for non-IBD, 21.7 ± 7.6% to 49.0 ± 15.0% for UC, and 34.9 ± 6.39 to62.3 ± 18.8 for CD subjects. Using linear mixed-effects model ANOVA,
we found that combined azo-reducing species are signi ﬁcantly more
abundant in CD subjects than in non-IBD subjects ( P50.002) and are
not signi ﬁcantly more abundant in UC subjects than in non-IBD subjects
(P50.064) (Fig. 5A). Note that Fig. 5B shows the same relative abun-
dance values displayed in Fig. 5A but over the course of the study, from
collection 1 to collection 24.Multiple Strains of F. Nucleatum ,B. Fragilis , and C. Clostri-
dioforme Reduce Acid Orange 7 in Vitro. Finally, we sought to test
the azo reduction of Acid Orange 7 by three strains of the health-rele-
vant (Castellarin et al., 2012; Kostic et al., 2012; Bashir et al., 2015;Abed et al., 2016) microbe F. nucleatum . As well, we tested the azo re-
duction of Acid Orange 7 by two positive control species, B. fragilis
andC. clostridioforme . Acid Orange 7 is an azo-bonded dye commonly
used in the food and textile industries (Bay et al., 2014), and the decol-
orization of azo-bonded dyes is commonly used to test azo reduction by
bacteria in vitro (Feng et al., 2012). F. nucleatum CTI-06, F. nucleatum
subsp. animalis D11, and F. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum were
g r o w ni nB H Im e d i a ,a n dA c i dO r a n g e7w a sa d d e dt ot h ec u l t u r eafter 4 days of growth ( Materials and Methods ). We also tested the
azo reduction of Acid Orange 7 by the known azo-reducing speciesB. fragilis andClostridium clostridiforme .B. fragilis strains 3_1_12 and
CL07T00C01 and C. clostridioforme strains 2_1_49_FAA and WAL-
7855 were grown in YCFA broth and served as positive controls. Wefound that all strains examined in this assay signi ﬁcantly decolorized
Acid Orange 7 in vitro (Fig. 6). To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst re-
porting of azo reduction by F. nucleatum CTI-06, F. nucleatum subsp.
animalis D11, and F. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum.
Discussion
The presence of azo-reducing bacteria in the human gut is necessary
for the effective delivery and activation of azo-bonded prodrugs.

Systematic comparison with Zimmermann et al. (2019) sulfasalazine consumption results
Complete results from the systematic comparison of predicted sulfasalazine-reducing bacteria to actual sulfasalazine-reducing bacteria. The co lumns labeled FC (fold change),
FC_STD (standard deviation in fold change), P_FDR (FDR adjusted P value), Pct_Consumed (percent consumed), and Pct_Consumed_STD (standard deviat i o no ft h ep e r c e n t
consumed) were all obtained directly from Zimmermann et al. (2019) (Supplemental Table 3). The SR_Status column contains values SR and non-SR, which were determined
based on significant (p_FDR < 0.05) or nonsignificant (p_FDR $0.05) sulfasalazine reduction. The PR_Status column contains the values PR and non-PR, which were deter-
mined based on the presence or absence of one or more azoreductase homologs determined from the homolog search step. The final column, Result, contain s the values TP
(true positive), TN (true negative), FP (false positive), and FN (false negative). Correctly predicted SR strains have a result of TP and correctly predicted Non-SR strains have a
result of TN whereas incorrectly predicted SR strains have a result of FP and incorrectly predicted Non-SR strains have a result of FN.

phyla of the human gut microbiota (Zimmermann et al., 2019) and ap-
pears to be ubiquitous across healthy individuals (Javdan et al., 2020),the prevalence, abundance, and distribution of azoreductases have notbeen systematically examined in the human gut microbiome of healthy
individuals nor in individuals living with IBD. In this work, we curated
and compiled known azoreductase genes (Fig. 2), searched for azore-ductase gene families across a nonr edundant set of 4644 human gut bac-
terial genomes (Almeida et al., 2020), and identi ﬁed 1958 putative
azo-reducing species (Fig. 3). The systematic comparison of our searchresults to recent experimental evidence of sulfasalazine reduction byprominent gut bacteria (Table 1, Table 2) indicates a disconnect be-
tween the current state of azoreductase annotation and experimental
evidence of sulfasalazine reduction. Interestingly, the majority (77.1%,
27/35) of incorrectly predicted sulfasalazine-reducing strains are falsenegatives, meaning these strains did not return a signi ﬁcant hit to an
azoreductase gene from the homolog search step but do, in fact, reduce
sulfasalazine in vitro. This inconsistency between annotated azoreduc-
tases and experimental evidence of azo reduction suggests that manyprominent bacterial strains of the human gut microbiome may encodeand express previously uncharacterized azoreductase genes. These genes
likely serve other endogenous roles such as nitro reduction (Liu et al.,
2007; Chalansonnet et al., 2017) and quinone oxidoreduction (Leelak-riangsak et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2008; Ryan et al., 2010a; Ryan et al.2010b; Ryan et al., 2014), with the azo reduction being a side mecha-nism that these
enzymes crossfunctionally participate in.
We next sought to report the relative abundance and expression of
azoreductases in the human gut microbiome for healthy controls and
IBD patients. Our analysis of 1558 metagenomic samples from 326 in-dividuals across healthy, UC, and CD patient cohorts showed that cladeI ,I I ,I I I ,I V a ,I V b ,m d a B ,a n dy i e Fa z o r e d u c t a s e sa r es i g n i ﬁcantly more

Fig. 6. Three putative azo-reducing strains of F. nucleatum degrade Acid Orange 7 in vitro. The absorbance of light at 550 nm (corresponding to the absorbance spec-
tra of Acid Orange 7) was measured in cultures of F. nucleatum, B. fragilis , and C. clostridiforme isolate cultures. F. nucleatum strains were grown in BHI media and
were compared with BHI-blank control mixture, whereas B. fragilis andC. clostridiforme strains were grown in YCFA media and were thus compared with a YCFA-
blank. Each strain was grown and tested in biologic and technical triplicates. Each data point on the plot above is the average of three technical replicates from a sin-
gle biologic replicate per strain. Please see Materials and Methods for more details regarding our experimental methodology. Asterisks indicate statistical significance
calculated via two-sided ttests ( *P< 0.05; **P< 0.01; ***P< 0.001).150 Braccia et al. at ASPET Journals on August 29, 2024 dmd.aspetjournals.org Downloaded from expression of azoreductases by the human gut microbiota and found
that, with the exception of clade IVb, expression levels of azoreductases
roughly match with their corresponding genomic abundance (Fig. 4C).
The incongruence of clade IVb abundance and expression levels sug-gests that, when feasible, shotgun metagenomic sequencing of stool
samples should be performed in parallel with metatranscriptomic se-
quencing to better understand the functional landscape of the gut micro-biome and the relative contributions of different azoreductases to
overall azo reduction. We also sought to examine the relative abundance
of known and putative azo-reducing bacteria in healthy, UC, and CDpatients over time. We found that the relative abundance of known and
putative azo-reducing bacteria is signi ﬁcantly ( P50.002) higher in in-
dividuals with CD and is modestly ( P50.06) higher in individuals
with UC compared with healthy controls (Fig. 5). This bodes well for
the future of azo-bonded prodrug development because these therapies
are intended to treat individuals af ﬂicted with UC and CD. However,
the cumulative relative abundance of known and putative azo-reducing
bacteria ﬂuctuates over time (Fig. 5B), and future studies should explore
whether there exists some minimu m necessary abundance of a zo-reduc-
ing species for adequate prodrug metabolism and activation.
Finally, we tested the reduction of the azo-bonded dye Acid Orange
7b yt h r e es t r a i n so f F. nucleatum alongside positive control strains of
B. fragilis andC. clostridioforme (Fig. 6). F. nucleatum is positively
correlated with colorectal cancer (Marchesi et al., 2011; Kostic et al.,
2012), is present in and on cancerous tissue (Castellarin et al., 2012),and possibly contributes to the etiology of the disease (McCoy et al.,
2013; Rubinstein et al., 2013; Han, 2015). We found that F. nucleatum
CTI-06, F. nucleatum subsp. animalis D11, and F. nucleatum subsp.
polymorphum all signi ﬁcantly reduce Acid Orange 7 in vitro, indicating
the encoding and activity of azoreductases in these strains of F. nucleatum.
TheF. nucleatum reference strain present in UHGG received signi ﬁcant
hits to the mdaB (E-value 54.20 × 10
/C013) and yieF (E-value 51.40 ×
10/C023) HMMs and, thus, represents an accurately predicted azo-reducing
bacteria (Supplemental Table 3). The identi ﬁcation and characterization of
these, and possibly other, F. nucleatum azoreductases could lead to the
eventual development of an azo-bonded colorectal cancer therapeutic
designed speci ﬁcally to activate in the presence of F. nucleatum on the
surface of colonic tumors.
B. fragilis is a known reducer of azo dyes including Acid Orange 7
(this study), Amaranth, Orange II, and Tartrazine (Bragger et al., 1997),
as well as of the quinone menadione (Ito et al., 2020). Additionally,
many B. fragilis strains have been shown to be potent reducers of sulfa-
salazine in vitro (Zimmermann et al., 2019). Although we did identify a
signiﬁcant (E-value < 1 × 10/C045) hit to the clade IVa HMM in the two
B. fragilis reference strains present in UHGG (Supplemental Table 3),
there may be other B. fragilis genes or operons that exhibit azoreductase
activity. Ito et al. (2020) described two NADH:quinone oxidoreductase
operons, NQR and NUO, and one NADH:qui none oxidoreductase
gene, ndh2, capable of reducing the quinone menadione. Recall that
bacterial quinone oxidoreductases are often crossreactive with azo com-
pounds and have even been proposed to be a part of the same FMN-dependent superfamily of NAD(P)H utilizing oxidoreductase enzymes
(Ryan et al., 2014). Future studies are required to con ﬁrm or deny that
NQR, NUO, and ndh2 are hitherto uncharacterized azoreductases con-
tributing to the complete azo reduction of sulfasalazine by B. fragilis
shown in Zimmerman et al. (2019).
Of the seven bacterial strains tested for reduction of Acid Orange 7,
the two C. clostridioforme strains exhibited by far the most effective re-
duction of Acid Orange 7 (Fig. 6). Although C. clostridioforme is a
known azo dye reducer (Raf ﬁand Cerniglia, 1990; Nakamura et al.,
2002; Xu et al., 2010), neither of the two reference strains present in
UHGG recruited signi ﬁcant alignments to known azoreductase genefamilies curated in the homolog search step of this work (Supplemental
Table 3). This could be the result of either 1) strain-level variation be-tween the reference strains and those tested with Acid Orange 7 in thisstudy or 2) the presence and activity of one or more uncharacterizedazoreductases in C. clostridioforme . In either case, further research in-
cluding a comparative genomics analysis and gene knockout experimenton various strains of C. clostridioforme could lead to an improved un-
derstanding of gut microbial azo reduction.
This study has two primary limitations. 1) The E-value and percent
of alignment thresholds for determining a putative azoreductase in thehomolog search step are not absolute but rather are designed to strike abalance between identifying spurious homologs and missing the identi ﬁ-
cation of true azoreductase homologs. This is an inherent limitation ofstudies requiring hard cutoffs for homolog classi ﬁcation and, thus, is
very dif ﬁcult to avoid. 2) Bacterial azoreductases exhibit different sub-
strate speci ﬁcities (Bin et al., 2004; Deller et al., 2006; Sugiura et al.,
2006; Joshi et al., 2008; Ryan et al., 2010a, ; Mendes et al., 2011; Langet al., 2013) and, thus, have varying af ﬁnities for different azo prodrugs
as well as azo dyes. Though we show a signi ﬁcant reduction of Acid
Orange 7 by three strains of F. nucleatum in this work, future experi-
ments showing the reduction of azo drugs such as sulfasalazine wouldfurther bolster the hypothesis that F. nucleatum encodes and expresses
one or more uncharacterized azoreductases.
In conclusion, we show that known azoreductases are widely distrib-
uted in the human gut microbiome and that there are likely many more
uncharacterized azoreductases encoded and expressed in the human gut
microbiome. These results both 1) bolster previous ﬁndings suggesting
the ubiquity of azo-reduction in the gut microbiome (Javdan et al.,2020) and 2) suggest the presence and activity of many hitherto unchar-acterized azoreductases in the human gut microbiome. The list of falsenegative strains identi ﬁed in our systematic comparison analysis can
serve as a resource for future studies focused on identifying azoreduc-tases encoded by the human gut microbiome (Table 1). Overall, thiswork describes the abundance and distribution of known azoreductasesin the human gut microbiome and motivates the need for future studiesfocused on annotating hitherto uncharacterized azoreductases encoded
in the human gut microbiome. Further validation and annotation of pu-
tative azoreductases encoded by prominent members of the gut ﬂora
such as B. fragilis, F. nucleatum, andC. clostridioforme , are important
