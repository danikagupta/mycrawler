ABSTRACT  
We assessed the potentials of a bacterial consortium isolated from oil 
contaminated soil for the biodegradation of aniline. The consortium 
(CAHY2) was found to be composed of Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus 
lentimorbus and Bacillus mycoides and was able to utilize aniline and two of 
its chlorinated derivatives, 4-chloroaniline (4-CA) and 2,4-dichloroaniline 
(2,4-DCA), as sole nitrogen and carbon sources in the preferential order 2,4-
dichloroaniline >4-chloroaniline >aniline and at the rates of 0.78 to 3.82 
µmoles L1 h1. The acclimatized bacterial consortium metabolized 260 mgL-1 
each of 4-CD and 2,4-DCA by as much as 9 and 40% respectively. The 
additional nitrogen sources such as KNO2 and NH4Cl enhanced the 
biodegradation of aniline 6 and 10 times, respectively. Although various 
intermediate products were formed during the biodegradation of aniline, only 
1,4-benzenediol was identified, but it disappeared after 21 days. When KNO2 
was used as an additional nitrogen source, two intermediates (biphenyl-amine 
and 4-phenyl-aniline) were detected, while three (3-formylaniline, 2-
acetylaniline and 1,4 -benzenediol) were detected when NH4Cl was used as an 
additional nitrogen source. We conclude that the consortium of Bacillus 
species could biodegrade aniline and its chlorinated derivatives to less toxic 
intermediates and that additional nitrogen sources could enhance their 
metabolism.

Introduction  
Anilines are aromatic compounds used for 
the manufacture of pesticides, dyes, plastics 
and pharmaceutical products(ATSDR 1999). 
These aromatic amines are also formed 
during the biotransformation of 
nitroaromatics such as explosives and 
dinitroaniline herbicides (de Souza et al., 
1998; Cullington and Walker, 1999; el-Deeb 
et al., 2000; El-Fantroussi et al., 2000; 
Tixier et al., 2001; Tixier et al., 2002). As a 
consequence of their wide distribution in the 
environment, they are frequently found in 
sediments, soils and residual industrial water 
(Kosson and Byrne 1995). In principle, a 
great number of physicochemical processes 
can affect the destiny of aniline in the 
environment, including evaporation, 
autoxidation, photoxidation, chemical 
oxidation, chemical transformation and 
biodegradation. In soils, aniline binds to 
humic materials as a result of a chemical 
transformation, and thus, their 
mineralization is very slow. In aquatic 
media, biodegradation is an important 
mechanism for its removal. However, some 
media rich in organic matter could cause 
some chemical transformations that are not 
conducive for its removal. These 
transformations also occur in the process of 
disinfection of residual waters, where the 
action of oxidizing agents, such as 
hypochlorous acid (in the presence of 
organic matter and nitrogenous sources such 
as amines or ammonia) results in the 
formation of chloride aryl amines in the 
biological treatments. Free chloride or 
bromide can also bind with organic 
compounds such as aryl amines or phenols 
through microbial routes by means of 
halogenation reactions, resulting in the 
formation of chloramines (Tachikawa et al., 
2005) or bromophenols during drinking 
water chlorination (Acero et al., 2005). On 
the other hand, various microorganisms that degrade aniline and chloride anilines have 
been reported, among them Pseudomonas 
putida UCC22 (pTDN1)(Konopka et al 
1989; Paris and Wolfe 1987; Fujii et al., 
1997; Boon et al., 2000, 2001; Dejonghe et 
al., 2002), Acinetobacter sp. YAA 
(Chaudhry and Chapalamadugu 1991; 
Fetzner and Lingens 1994; Fukumori and 
Saint 1997), Rhodococcus sp. AN-
22(Matsumura et al., 2006), and Delftia 
tsuruhatensis H1 (Zhang et al., 2010); and 
Erwinia sp (Li et al., 2010). However, there 
is a dearth of literature implicating Bacillus 
species in aniline biodegradation; but even 
then, such reports are mostly on axenic 
cultures (Yao et al., 2011; Sewarde and 
Gawai, 2014; Liu et al., 2014). There is 
paucity of information on aniline 
biodegradation by Bacillus consortia and the 
influence of additional nitrogen sources on 
the biodegradation of the pollutant. In this 
paper, we report on the biodegradation of 
aniline by a consortium of three Bacillus 
species in an effort to develop an active 
microbial consortium of relevance in the 
bioremediation of aniline compounds 
polluted environments.   
Materials and Methods  
Enrichment cultures  
A mixed culture of bacteria was isolated 
from waste sludge from an oil refinery plant 
by enrichment, using a mixture of aniline 
and chloroaniline as the sole source of 
carbon and nitrogen in a mineral saline 
medium (MSM) (Kästner et al., 1994). The 
composition of MSM was (L1): Na2HPO4, 
(2.1 g); KH 2PO4 (1.3 g) and then 2.5 ml each 
of 1 molL1 MgSO4 and 36 mmolL1 
FeSO4.7H2O and a trace elements solution 
were added. The pH of the MSM was 
adjusted to 6.5, autoclaved and allowed to 
cool. Three sets of media were used; one 
MSM containing KNO2 (0.8 g) as nitrogen  
 
165 
source, the second MSM with NH4Cl (0.5 g) 
as nitrogen source, both with a C/N ratio of 
2, corresponding to modified MSM 
(McCarthy 1987; Alaoui et al., 2001), and 
the third without an additional nitrogen 
source (C/N ratio of 6). Biodegradation 
studies were carried out with aniline or 
chloroanilines added to the three mineral 
media at the required concentration from a 
stock solution (5% w/w of each compound). 
The cultures were incubated aerobically for 
eight weeks at 28°C on a horizontal shaker 
at 200 rpm.  
Isolation and maintenance of 
chlorophenol -degrading microorganism 
CAHY2  
From the enrichment culture, several 
bacterial isolates were recovered in the 
presence of 1.6, 2.0 and 2.7mM of a mixture 
of aniline and chloroaniline in accordance 
with the description of Pries et al. (1994). 
The isolates were maintained through 
subsequent transfers in MSM with 1.6, 2.0 
and 2.7 mM of 2 ,4-dichloroaniline (2,4 -DC), 
4-chloroaniline (4-CA) and aniline, 
respectively, and incubated as described 
earlier (Pries et al., 1994). A sample of the 
8-week old culture was spread onto the 
surface of Nutrient agar (Bioxon, Mexico) 
and incubated at 28°C. Three 
morphologically distinct colony types were 
isolated, purified and identified.  
Identification of bacterial isolates  
The three purified bacterial isolates were 
identified by 16S rDNA sequencing as 
described by Estrada-de los Santos et al. 
(2001). The nucleotide sequences of the 
amplicons were analyzed by the Basic Local 
Assignment Search Tool (BLAST) to 
confirm the identities of the different 
bacterial isolates.  Aniline and chloroanilines biodegradation 
experiments  
Batch culture experiments for the 
degradation of aniline and chloroanilines, 
using the bacterial consortium were carried 
out individually in Erlenmeyer flasks (250 
mL) containing 2.7 mM of aniline, 2 mM of 
4-chloroaniline, and 1.6 mM of 2,4-
dichloroaniline in 100 mL of previously 
steam sterilized (110°C for 30 min) MSM 
without an additional nitrogen source. All 
experiments were carried out in triplicate. 
The flasks were inoculated with 10% v/v of 
the bacterial consortia culture (CAHY2) to 
yield an initial biomass concentration of140 
mg L1, and incubated aerobically at 28°C 
with agitation at 200 rpm. Culture samples 
were taken at regular intervals over a period 
of 7 days and analyzed for biomass, aniline 
and chloroanilines. Control experiments 
were setup in parallel to estimate the levels 
of abiotic losses. All experiments and 
controls were carried out in triplicat e.  
Kinetics of aniline biodegradation   
The kinetics of aniline biodegradation was 
assessed under the same conditions as 
described above. Three sets of media were 
used, one containing MSM without an 
additional nitrogen source, and two others 
with an additional nitrogen source (NH4Cl), 
corresponding to the MSM described above, 
and another with KNO2 (McCarthy 1987; El 
Alaoui et al., 2001) termed MSM modified. 
Triplicates of these experiments (using 5.3 
mM of aniline) were incubated at 28°C and 
200 rpm. Kinetic samples were taken at 0, 7, 
14 and 21 days, and analyzed for biomass, 
aniline and metabolites, prior to acid 
(HCl1M) extraction with ethyl acetate, 
followed by GC analysis. Control 
experiments were used with non-inoculated 
flasks under the same conditions.

Isolation and characterization of the 
aniline metabolites in batch experiments   
The Bacillus consortium was incubated at 
28°C in Erlenmeyer flasks containing MSM 
or MSM modified medium with aniline at 
5.3 mM was added. After the different 
incubation times, the contents of the flasks 
were collected and centrifuged at 10000g. 
The supernatant fluid was acidified with 
HCl 1 M and then extracted with ethyl 
acetate. The organic layers were dried over 
anhydrous sodium sulphate, evaporated to 
dryness in a rotary evaporator (Schlosser et 
al., 2000) and dissolved in 1ml of ethyl 
acetate for gas chromatography-mass 
spectrometry (GC -MS) analysis.  
Analytical procedures  
The quantification of aniline, chloroanilines 
and their biodegradation products was done 
by means of a gas chromatograph, using HP 
6890 adapted to a mass spectrometer 
detector model 5972 (GC-MS) and injector 
7973. The GC-MS was equipped with an 
HP5MS and HP1 column of 30 m length, 
0.25 mm internal diameter and 0.25 µm of 
film thickness. Helium was used as the 
carrier gas at a flow rate of 2.9 ml min1. 
The conditions for analysis were: split 1:20; 
range of mass scan 50500; with 
temperatures as follows: injector 260°C, 
detector 280°C; gradient program: 65°C to 
96°C (4°C min1), 96°C to 160°C (8°C min
1) and up to 230°C (12°C min1). The MS 
spectra of the metabolites were compared to 
those of the standards and previously 
published spectra (Environmental Protection 
Agency/National Institute of Health 
1980).Biomass was monitored as cell dry 
weight by filtering 5 mL of culture effluent 
onto pre-weighed polycarbonate filters (pore 
size, 0.4 mm), drying the preparation at 
60°C for 24 h, and weighing the filter with 
the cells. Chemicals  
Aniline, 4-chloroaniline (4-CA), 2,4-
dichloroaniline (2,4-DCA), 1,4-benzenediol, 
and ethyl acetate (analytical grade) were 
purchased from the Sigma -Aldrich Chemical 
Company Co., I nc.   
Results and Discussion  
Isolation of aniline and chloroanilines 
degrading CAHY2 -bacteria  
The bacterial consortium obtained after the 
enrichment process was capable of growing 
in a mineral medium containing a mixture of 
aniline and chloroanilines as the carbon and 
nitrogen sources. Members of the bacterial 
consortium were identified as Bacillus 
subtilis, Bacillus lentimorbus, and Bacillus 
mycoides. This consortium was 
subsequently used to study the 
biodegradability of aniline, 4-CA, and 2,4-
DCA.  
Use of aniline and chloroanilines  
The ability of the CAHY2 consortium to use 
aniline or chloroanilines as sole sources of 
carbon and nitrogen were assessed. The 
results of the biodegradation are as 
presented in table 1. The CAHY2 
consortium utilized the anili ne and two of its 
chlorinated derivatives (4-CA, and 2,4-
DCA) for growth and preferentially 
metabolized them in the following order: 
2,4-CA>4-CA>aniline. Aniline and 4-CA 
were biodegraded to a lesser extent. The 
explanation for the low biodegradation of 4-
CA could be the position of the halogen in 
the molecule, that could determine its 
biodegradation. Given that the 
biodegradation of aniline was very low (0.78 
µmoles L-1 h-1), it was necessary to 
acclimatize the consortium to this 
compound, up to 3.0 mM. Preliminary  
 
167 
results revealed that under these conditions, 
the cell biomass doubled within seven days 
from an initial biomass of approximately140 
mg L1 and also that KNO2 as a source of 
nitrogen was able to enhance aniline 
biodegradability. The acclimatized Bacillus 
consortium was able to metabolize4-CA and 
2,4-DCA by9% and 40%, respectively.   
Effect of the addition of an additional 
nitrogen source on aniline biodegradation  
The effect of additional nitrogen sources on 
aniline biodegradation was assessed and the 
results are a presented in figure 1. The 
kinetic of growth revealed a slow lag phase 
during the first 7 days of reaction, with a 
subsequent exponential growth, reaching a 
maximum biomass of 0.7g L-1. The aniline 
biodegradation followed a rapid pattern for 
the first 14 days, and after 21 days of 
reaction approximately 60% of the aniline 
had been biodegraded at 6.6 ± 0.1 µmoles L-
1h-1. The pH remained constant during the 
process of biodegradation. The 
biodegradation of aniline by the consortium 
in the presence of KNO2as an additional 
nitrogen source permitted the detection of 
only two metabolites by GC analysis (Table 
2). After 7 days of culture, metabolites I and 
II, with retention times of 10.02 and 17.88 
min, began to appear and their concentration 
slightly diminished and finally disappeared 
by day 21. Intermediate I was identified as 
biphenylamine with the molecular ion peak 
as the base peak at m/z 169. The loss of a 
phenyl group (m/z 77) afforded the peak at 
m/z 91 (Budzikiewicz et al., 1991). 
Intermediate II was identified as 4-
phenylaniline with molecular ion peak at 
m/z 169, and major peak fragments at m/z 
154 due to the loss of NH2 from the 
molecular ion, and m/z 77 corresponding to 
a phenyl group (Budzikiewicz , 1988).   
Additionally, kinetic studies of the aniline 
biodegradation were carried out using an MSM medium containing ammonium 
chloride (NH4Cl) as the nitrogen source. The 
growth kinetic of the consortium showed a 
slow lag phase during the first 7 days, with a 
subsequent exponential growth, reaching a 
maximum biomass of 0.8 g L-1. Aniline 
biodegradation increased steadily attaining 
about 95% degradation in 14 days and 
complete biodegradation in 21 days (Figure 
2). The biodegradation rate was 10.56 ± 0.35 
µmoles L-1 h-1.   
The products of aniline biodegradation were 
extracted with ethyl acetate from the culture 
at different incubation times. Three 
intermediates of aniline biodegradation in 
the cultures with NH4Cl as an additional 
nitrogen source were identified by GC-MS 
(Table 3).  The intermediate I was identified 
as 3-formylaniline with the molecular ion 
peak at m/z 121 (100) plus 93 (88), 77 (10) 
and 66 (76) mass fragments. The 
intermediate II was identified as 2-
acetylaniline with a molecular ion peak at 
m/z 135 (28) and 93 (100), 77 (6), and 65 
(24) as major fragments. The m/z pattern of 
metabolite III with the molecular ion at m/z 
110 as the base peak, and ion fragments at 
m/z 81 (71), 63 (15), and 53 (60) was 
identified as 1,4 -benzenediol.   
The presence of an additional nitrogen 
source also affected the biodegradation level 
(Table 4). A C/N ratio favoured the aniline 
biodegradation compared with the control 
where only aniline was used as nitrogen and 
carbon source.   
CAHY2 was capable of degrading aniline, 
mono and dichloroanilines as the only 
source of carbon and nitrogen. It would 
appear that the presence of the halogens 
moiety and its position was a determining 
factor in the biodegradability of chlorinated 
compounds, but in this case, the 
biodegradation level was low for aniline. A 
comparison of the biodegradability of  
 
168 
aniline compounds was undertaken by Paris 
and Wolfe (1987), demonstrating that the 
presence of derivatives diminishes the level 
of biodegradability of the compounds.   
The capacity of Bacillus species to 
biodegrade different halogenated 
compounds was demonstrated in our 
previous report(Herrera et al., 2008). In the 
present study, the consortium tolerated high 
concentrations of aniline and chloroanilines. 
Also, this study demonstrated that the 
inhibitory effect of the substrates can be 
reduced and the degrading capacity of the 
consortium increased by means of the 
previous acclimatization of the microbial 
consortia to the different compounds. It has 
been reported that the mineralization of 
many organic compounds in different 
environments is preceded by a period of 
adaptation that can vary depending on the 
compound (Radianingtyas et al., 2003; 
Vangnai and Petchkroh , 2007).   
The mineralization and biotransformation of 
toxic compounds have been widely studied 
by various authors (Spain et al., 1980; 
Wiggins et al., 1987; Berg and Nyholm, 
1996; Nyholm et al., 1996; Raymond et al., 
2001; Ahtiainen et al., 2003; Torang and 
Nyholm, 2005). These studies demonstrated 
that the degrading capacity of the 
microorganisms used strongly depends on 
the environmental conditions as well as the 
microbial interactions involved when natural 
or mixed consortia are used (Campo et al., 
2011). Biotransformation can produce more 
soluble and less toxic compounds by means 
of detoxifying processes as well as more 
toxic intermediaries through processes of 
metabolic activation (Alexander , 1999).   
In the current study, it was demonstrated 
that the presence of an additional nitrogen 
source in the culture medium, could increase 
the biodegradation level 6 and 10 times with KNO2 and NH4Cl, respectively. The 
biodegradation level and the intermediate 
products formed were also different in both 
conditions.   
With the identities of these intermediates, it 
was possible to propose the principal 
metabolic reactions which occur during the 
biodegradation of aniline. These reactions 
consisted of acylation, oxidation, and 
condensation. The products formed can also 
be classified into two categories according 
to their structure: 1) products derived from 
aniline and 2) by-products of oxidation. 
Beside the oxidative desamination reactions 
caused by dioxygenase attacks, intermediary 
products were produced by formylation and 
acylation reactions. The formation of these 
products has been documented by other 
authors (Russel and Bollag, 1977; Lyons et 
al., 1984; Zeyer et al., 1985; Chaudhry and 
Chapalamadugu , 1991; Fetzner and Lingens , 
1994; Takenaka et al., 2003) and has been 
considered as a by-product of detoxification 
reactions.  
Results of this study suggest that the 
principal biodegradation pathway for aniline 
by the Bacillus consortium in the medium 
with (NH 4Cl) appears to involve formylation 
and acylation reactions, resulting in the 
formation of 3-formylaniline, 2-
acetylaniline. The biodegradation of aniline 
and its metabolites was complete by day 21. 
However, the formation of 1,4-benzenediol, 
the final by-product of the biodegradation of 
aniline, permits the assumption that the most 
important route was oxidative desamination 
(Lyons et al., 1984).  In other studies with p -
chloroaniline, this compound was 
metabolized completely by Chlorella 
fuscarubra mostly to water-soluble 
products. After 4 weeks of degradation, 28% 
of the radioactivity was recovered from 
algae and 35% from the aqueous mediu m.

Metabolites isolated were p,p'-
dichloroazoxybenzene and p,p'-
chloroazobenzene from algae and p-chloro-
formanilide and p-chloroanilide from the 
nutrient medium (Anagnostopoulos et al., 
1978). Future studies should be designed to 
evaluate the potential toxicity of these 
intermediates and also determine the 
biodegradability of aniline monocultures of 
the Bacillus species. The synthesis of the enzymes for the 
catabolism of an aromatic substrate 
generally requires the presence of an 
inducer, which is either the aromatic 
substrate itself or an intermediate in the 
degradation pathway. In most aniline-
degrading microbes, aniline degradation has 
been reported to be inducible. Kaminski et 
al. (1983) found that aniline metabolism in 
Rhodococcus strain An117 was induced by  
 
171 
chloroanilines, even though the organism 
could not grow on them. In Moraxella strain 
G, aniline oxidation was induced by a wide 
variety of halogenated anilines, some of 
which supported the growth of the organism 
(Zeyer et al., 1985). After the investigation 
of the biodegradability of aniline under 
aerobic conditions with an additional 
nitrogen source, differences between the 
biodegradation level and intermediates 
formation were observed. These results are 
very important for the development of 
strategies for the biodegradation of some 
aniline based pesticides in natural 
environments.
