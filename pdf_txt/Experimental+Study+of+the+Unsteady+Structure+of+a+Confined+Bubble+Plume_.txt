Abstract  
For practical applications the Euler -Euler two -fluid model relies on suitable closure relations 
describing interfacial exchange process es. An ongoing effort at HZDR has led to a validated 
set of closures for adiabatic bubbly flows that is applicable under a rather broad range of 
conditions  including flows in pipes and bubble columns. Up to now , however, only flows 
with stationary mean val ues have been considered. The present contribution extends the 
model validation to dynamic flow phenomena by considering a periodically oscillating 
bubble plume. Consequently, the turbulence model then runs in URANS mode. L iterature 
data for a partially ae rated flat rectangular bubble column are used for comparison. In 
particular, r esults for the plume oscillation period show good agreement  between 
simulation and experiment.

   3 1 INTRODUCTION  
 
Bubbly flows are common in many engineering disciplin es comprising  chemical engineering , 
mineral processing, and biotechnology . The fluid dynamics of such systems  displays  complex 
behavior for which to date only partial understanding is available . Consequently , design and 
optimization of  technical equipment involving bubbly flow present a great challenge. In this 
situation, CFD simulations bear the potential of identifying energy - and resource - efficient 
solutions which are prohibitively expensive and time -consuming to uncover by conventi onal 
semi -empirical methods.  
CFD simulations of dispersed bubbly flow on the scale of technical equipment are feasible 
within the Eulerian two -fluid framework of interpenetrating continua. Since phenomena 
occurring on the scale of individual bubbles or gr oups thereof are not resolved in this 
approach , accurate numerical predictions rely on suitable closure relations  describing the  
physics of these  small - scale phenomena . As a first step towards a predictive model, a set of 
baseline closures applicable to adiabatic bubbly flows has been proposed in Rzehak and 
Krepper (2013)  comprising  the exchange of momentum between  gas and liquid phases and 
the effects of the dispersed bubbles on the turbulence of the liquid carrier phase. 
Comparison s between different m odel alternatives were made to select the most promising 
candidate for less deeply investigated submodels ( Rzehak et al. 2012, Rzehak and Krepper 
2013a ). Subsequently this baseline model has been applied to a number of diverse test 
cases to assure its vali dity for a broad range of conditions  (Rzehak et al. 2017, Shi and 
Rzehak 2018  and references therein) . This is a prerequisite to facilitate  reliable  predictions 
in situations  where no data exist against which the model results could be compared, such 
that it is not possible to make adjustments and the model has to be used in exactly the way 
it was proposed. This venture is continued in the present work.  
For the purpose of model validation it is vital that i n addition to local values of the phase 
fraction  and velocity field s, information on the bubble size is available  as well , since virtually 
all of the closure models used in Euler -Euler simulation s depend on this variable. Moreover, 
some parametric variation  of its value would be desirable in order to ma ke a meaningful 
comparison between different models.  Data selected according to these criteria  have been 
used in the validation studies mentioned above . However, only flows with stationary mean 
values were considered so far.  The purpose of the present work  is to extend the validation 
of the baseline model to a dynamic flow situation , namely  a periodically oscillating  bubble 
plume . This is a flow pattern that develops in bubble columns with localized gas injection  as 
sketched in Figure 1 below . In these devices the average motion of the gas stream 
emanating from the sparger is  not in a straight vertical path , but instead it is  deflected 
sidewards. If the depth of the column i s rather thin and the fill height exceeds a certain 
level , a periodic oscillation occurs between deflection to either side along the column width.  
This presents a time -dependent flow in which the period of the plume oscillations provide s 
a measure to valid ate the dynamic predictions of the baseline model.  
Early observations  of the basic phenomena were made by Lin et al. (1996), Delnoij et al. 
(1997) , Becker et al. (1999) , and Pfleger et al. (1999) . Mainly the depe ndence of the period 
of the bubble plume oscillations  on the gas volume flux was studied. Rensen and Roig (2001)  
cast their own and previous experimental data for the dependency of the plume oscillation 
period on various system parameters in dimensionless form.  Buwa and Ranade (2002, 2004, 
2005)  conducted a rather comprehensive study which included  spargers  producing bubbles  4 of different size in addition to varying aspect ratio (i.e. fill height over column width) and gas 
flow rate. Based on their own and previous data they also proposed a correla tion for the 
plume oscillation period in dimensionless form.  Diaz et al. (2006 , 2008) focused on 
characterizing the regimes of oscillating as opposed to stationary plumes in terms of aspect 
ratio  and gas flow rate.  An oscillating plume was found if the asp ect ratio exceeded a certain 
value around 2 while under this condition the oscillation period did not depend appreciably 
on the aspect ratio. A more recent investigation in this line was made by Upadhyay et al. 
(2013)  based on  the newly available technique  of Computer Aided Radioactive Particle 
Tracking (CARPT) . The experiments of Julia et al . (2007)  considered variation of the size of 
the sparged region and the crossover between partially and fully aerated columns.  Cachaza 
et al. (2011) and Laupsien  et al. (2017) performed experiments to investigate effects of 
material properties, namely surface tension and viscosity, respectively.  With the exception 
of surface tension, all parameters were included in the experiments of Liu et al. ( 2019). A 
correlati on for the plume oscillation frequency  was given in that work as well .  
Some of the previous studies also contained results from simulations of the respective 
setup. Delnoij et al. (1997) applied the Euler -Lagrange  framework accounting for drag , lift, 
and virtual mass force s acting on the bubbles. N o turbulence was considered in either 
phase . Pfleger et al. (1999) employed the Euler -Euler  framework  with a single phase k - 
turbulence model for the liquid  and turbulent dispersion was included by a diffusive term in 
the continuity equation . Only the drag force was taken into account.  The work of Buwa and 
Ranade (2002) was again based on the Euler -Euler  framework , for some  of the calculations  
coupled with a population -balance equation.  Again a  single phase k - turbulence model was 
used for the liquid  and turbulent dispersion was included by a diffusive term in the 
continuity equation . Forces acting on the bubbles , however , comprised in addition to drag  
also lift and virtual mass force s. A few f urther works devoted entirely to simulations have 
appeared  as well. Buwa et al.  (2006) showed Euler -Lagrange  simulations of their 
experiments with similar modeling of bubble forces  as liquid phase turbulence  as in their 
earlier Euler -Euler simulations. Turbulent dispersion was modeled by a discrete random 
walk model. Gupta and Roy (2013) investigated the setup of Upadhyay et al. (2013) by a 
coupled Euler -Euler population -balance framework. Drag, lift, and virtual mass force were 
considered and a RNG k - turbulence model was applied to the gas -liquid mixture.  
As may be seen, the previous simulations have used rather different overall approaches and 
different submodels for specific effects. This makes it difficult to select an appropriate 
model for  future applications , in particular where true predictions are sought (i.e. no data 
are available). Therefore it is advantageous to apply the baseline model introduced  at the 
outset , and this is the objective of the present work. From the available experimental da ta, 
the study of Buwa and Ranade (2002, 2004, 2005)  comes closest to the criteria defined 
above, and hence this is chosen as the core of the  comparison.  Supplementary data for very 
similar configurations are taken from Pfleger et al. (1999) and Diaz et al.  (2006) as well as 
Darmana et al. (2007), a study that focused more on mass transfer and chemical reaction, 
but also has data on the plume oscillations.  A description  of the se experiments  is given in 
section 2. The applied baseline model  is summarized  in section 3  with references to more 
detailed presentations that have been given previously . The simulation results are then 
presented in section 4 and compared to the measurements. The comparison with the data 
from Darmana et al. (2007) is taken from an earlier simulation study using the same model 
as the present one (Krauß and Rzehak 2018). Conclusions are  offered  in section 5.     5 2 SUMMARY OF EXPERIMEN TAL DATA  
In a series of works Buwa and Ranade (2002, 2004, 2005) investigated flows in a thin 
rectangular bubble column with localized gas injection in the center of the bottom plate as 
sketched in Figure 1. In all cases the aspect ratio of the column (i.e. the ratio of fill height to 
width , 𝐻/𝐷) was larger than 2 , such that an oscillating bubble plume develops (e.g. Diaz et 
al. 2006 ). The mai n parameters that were varied in the experiments are g as flow rate and 
aspect ratio. The former assumed values  between  𝐽𝐺= 0.14  and 0.73 cm/s . For the latter, a 
lower value was 𝐻/𝐷 = 2.25 and a higher value was in the range  
𝐻/𝐷 = 4.5 … 5.5. In addition , two different types of spargers were used , where one 
consisted of a perforated plate with 8 individual holes , the other one was a sintered disc. 
The main difference between the two sparger types was that they produced bubbles of 
different size. Details of the arrangement did not show appreciable effects. Air was used for 
the gas and tap water for the liquid.  Temperature and pressure are not specified  explicitly  
but presumably were at ambient values.

 6 The plume oscillation frequency was found by applying a Fourier transform to a time  series 
of fluctuating wall pressure in Buwa and Ranade (2002) and of fluctuating gas fraction in 
Buwa and Ranade  (2004 ). Bubble sizes were determined in Buwa and Ranade (2002) using 
high speed digital photography. Measurements of gas fraction were taken  along lateral 
profiles in the mid -plane of the channel at various axial locations above the inlet  in Buwa 
and Rana de (2002, 2005) by a conductivity probe .  
Additional data on oscillating bubble plumes are available from several other sources. 
Profiles of the mean liquid velocity were obtained in Pfleger et al. (1999) by means of LDA  
for a setup matching the one of Buw a and Ranade (2002, 2004, 2005) with the perforated 
plate sparger . Data on the total gas fraction are given in Diaz et al. (2006) for a column 
which measures only 40 mm in depth, but otherwise has the same geometry  as Buwa and 
Ranade (2002, 2004, 2005)  and Pfleger et al. (1999) . Finally, mean gas velocity profile and 
plume oscillation frequency were reported  by Darmana et al. (2007) for N2 bubbles in 
aqueous NaOH solution  in a bubble column with an aspect ratio of 5, a depth of 30 mm, and 
a sparger cons isting of 21 needles. The gas volume flux was 0.7 cm/s and the bubble size 5.5 
mm in these experiments. The slight variations in the experiment al conditions  of Diaz et al. 
(2006) and Darmana et al . (2007)  appear to have at most a minor impact  on the large scale 
features of the flow under investigation here.  
   7 3 MODEL DESCRIPTION AND NUMERICAL SETUP  
The physical models used for the simulations  are exactly the same as used in a number of 
previous studies . Since extensive  descriptions have been presen ted repeat edly, only a  rather 
concise summary is given here  for the sake of completeness together with references to the 
original works.  Material properties, geometry , and boundary conditions suitable for the 
present application are specified in detail.  
The conservation equations for two -phase flow are summarized as follows  (e.g. Drew and 
Passman 1998, Yeoh and Tu 2010, Ishii and Hibiki 2011) . 
The phasic continuity equations read  
 𝜕
𝜕𝑡(𝛼𝐺𝜌𝐺)+ ∇∙(𝛼𝐺𝜌𝐺𝒖𝐺)= 0   (1) 
 𝜕
𝜕𝑡(𝛼𝐿𝜌𝐿) + ∇∙(𝛼𝐿𝜌𝐿𝒖𝐿) = 0  , (2) 
while  the phasic momentum equations are  
 𝜕
𝜕𝑡(𝛼𝐺𝜌𝐺𝒖𝐺)+ ∇∙(𝛼𝐺𝜌𝐺𝒖𝐺⊗𝒖𝐺)
= −𝛼𝐺∇𝑝𝐺+ ∇∙(𝛼𝐺𝐓𝐺)+𝛼𝐺𝜌𝐺𝒈+𝑭𝐺𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟 (3) 
 𝜕
𝜕𝑡(𝛼𝐿𝜌𝐿𝒖𝐿) + ∇∙(𝛼𝐿𝜌𝐿𝒖𝐿⊗𝒖𝐿)  
= −𝛼𝐿∇𝑝𝐿+ ∇∙(𝛼𝐿𝐓𝐿)  +𝛼𝐿𝜌𝐿𝒈+𝑭𝐿𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟
 . (4) 
The term s 𝑭𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟 in Eqs. (3) and (4) account for the momentum transfer between the 
phases. Due to momentum conservation the relati on 𝑭𝐺𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟=−𝑭𝐿𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟 holds.  According to 
the baseline model applied herein , the interphase force  comprises of a number of 
contributions summarized in Table  1 together with the closure correlation used for each. 
Further details and validation studies can be found e.g. in Ziegenhein et al. (2013), Rzehak et 
al. (2015), Liao et al. 2016, Rzehak and K repper (2015), or Rzehak et al. (2017a) .

The stress tensor   
 𝐓= ( 𝜇+ 𝜇𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑏)(∇𝒖+(∇𝒖)𝑇) (5) 
comprises  both viscous and turbulent contributions . For the liquid phase, the turbulent  
dynamic viscosity 𝜇𝐿𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑏
  is calculated from a k -ω SST model with additional source terms 
accounting for the bubble - induced turbulence . Due to the low density and small spatial 
scales of the bubbles , turbulence may be neglected for the gas phase by setting  𝜇𝐺𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑏=0.  8 Further details on the turbulence modeling are given  e.g. in Rzehak and Krepper (2013a), 
Rzehak and Kriebitzsch (2015), Ziegenhein et al. (2017) or Pare kh and Rzehak (2018).  
To obtain a complete system of equations additional  relat ions are needed . Assuming each 
phase to be incompressible, these are an  expression  for the overall conservatio n of volume, 
𝛼𝐺+𝛼𝐿=1, and the assumption of pressure  equilibrium , 𝑝𝐺=𝑝𝐿=𝑝. 
The m aterial p roperties  used correspond to air bubbles in water at atmospheric  pressure 
and 25°C temperature and are summarized in Table 2.

The simulations are performed using the commercial  software ANSYS CFX 17.2 . The full 
volume of the column up to the  ungassed  fill height is considered as the computational 
domain . A degassing boundary condition is applied at the top of the domain. The sparger is 
modeled as a region of 24 x 12 mm size in the center of the bottom of the domain on which 
an inlet boundary condition  is pr escribed.  The area of this region corresponds to the area 
occupied by the sparger in the experiment, while details of the arrangement of the hole s are 
neglected. The gas flux through this area is set to the desired value for the case under 
considerat ion. On the rest of the bottom as well as on the side walls of the domain , a no -slip 
condition i s used for the liquid phase and a free -slip condition for the gas phase , assuming 
that direct contacts between the bubbles and the walls are negligible. To avoi d the need to 
resolve the viscous sub -layer, a single phase turbulent wall function assuming a smooth wall 
is applied which consists of a blend between inertial and viscous sub -layers (referred to as 
“automatic wall -function treatment” in the ANSYS -CFX use r guide).  Simulations are run in a 
time -dependent mode corresponding to an URANS treatment of turbulence  (Ziegenhein et 
al. 2017). A s a consequence, time -averaging is applied to all quantities . A grid spacing of 
~3 mm in all space directions was determined as suitable in a grid independence study. In 
Figure 2 and Figure 3 results for a finer grid with ~2 mm grid spacing are shown for 
comparison. Deviations between results for the  vertical component of liquid velocity and  
gas fraction on both grids are seen to be small already. The difference obtained  for the 
period of plume oscillations is less than 2%. Similarly an averaging interval of 300  s was 
determined to yield converged averages  of all quantities . The b ubbl e size  was taken as 5 .0 
mm for the perforated plate  sparger and 2. 2 mm for the sintered disc sparger  in accordance 
with the experiments  of Buwa and Ranade (2002) . 
 
   9 4 SIMULATION RESULTS  
Since the different works summarized in section 2 use different combinations of parameters 
and provide different measured quantities, a suitable selection ha s to be made in order to 
keep the number of simulations within reasonable bounds while  providing the best possible 
comparison with the experimental data. The test conditions chosen for the simulations are 
listed  in Table 3. The available mea surement data for each case will be discussed  together 
with the comparison  to the simulation results, first for the time -averaged phasic velocities 
and phase fractions, then for the plume oscillation period, which is a dynamic property of 
the flow.

Table 3: Summary of test conditions  used for the simulations .  
 
 Average velocities and gas fraction  4.1
First, test case N1 is considered, for which lateral profiles of the liquid velocity are available 
at different heights (130, 250, and 370 mm) of the column from Pfleger et al. (1999) and at 
the highest level a gas fraction profile is available from Buwa a nd Ranade (2002). The gas 
volume flux for these experiments is 𝐽𝐺= 0.14 cm/s and the column aspect ratio is 𝐻/𝐷=
 2.25 , exactly matching the values used in the simulations . Comparison of the  
measurements with the corresponding results of the present sim ulations is shown in Figure  10 2 and Figure 3, respectively. For the liquid velocity, good agreement is found at the lowest 
level, while at t he higher levels, the simulations overestimate the peak value of the velocity 
in the center of the column as well as the recirculating velocity near the column walls. For 
the gas fraction, agreement between simulation and experiment is very good. A notable  
asymmetry between left and right halves of the experimental profiles for both liquid 
velocity and gas fraction points to the fact that averaging was performed over a too short 
time interval containing too few oscillation periods of the bubble plume. In th e simulation 
results such an asymmetry is not seen.  
A profile of gas velocity for conditions close to test case N5 (specifically 𝐽𝐺= 0.7 cm/s , 
𝐻/𝐷= 5, and 𝑑𝑏= 5.5 mm ) is available from a previous study (Krauß and Rzehak, 2018). 
There, simulations we re run using the same model as the present investigation and 
compared to experimental data from Darmana et al. (2007). Since these results nicely 
complement the present study , they are included in  Figure 4. It can be seen that the peak of 
the calculated gas velocity matches the measurements very well, while the calculated values 
near the wall are too high in comparison.  
For the test cases N2 to N5, further data on the gas fractions are available from Buwa and 
Ranade (2005).  The experimental conditions comprise two values of the gas volume flux  
𝐽𝐺= 0.16 and 0.73 cm/s , the lower of which is similar to that of test case N 1, and two values 
of the column aspect ratio 𝐻/𝐷= 2.25 and 4.5 , again exactly matching the values used in 
the simulations . Measurements  are taken at three levels as indicated in Figure 5, where they 
are compared to the corresponding simulation results. At the lowest level, the simulated 
profiles are too peaked. This effect is more pronounced for the higher value of the gas 
volume flux and for the lower value of the aspect ratio, where the measurement level  is at a 
smaller fraction of the total fill height.  At the higher levels, the simulations agree very well 
with the measurements for the lower value of the gas flux and both values of the a spect 
ratio. For the higher value of the gas flux the simulations tend to have too broad shoulders. 
At the lower value of the aspect ratio quantitative agreement with the experimental data is 
still good, but at  the higher value of the aspect ratio signific ant deviations are seen . 
To further elucidate  this behavior, gas fraction profiles obtained from the simulations of all 
test cases N1 to N11 are shown in Figure 6 at the highest measurement level for both values 
of the aspect ratio . This includes  further  values of the gas volume flux intermediate to those 
of Figure 5 for which no measured gas fraction profiles are available . With increasing gas 
volume flux, the peak gas fraction obviously increases. At the same time however, the 
profile shape changes from a rather narrow peak to a broader shape with shoulders on each 
side. For the same value of the gas volume flux, the change is more pronounced at the 
higher value of the aspect ratio.  
Finally, Figure 7 shows a comparison of the total gas fraction contained in the entire column 
for test cases N1-N3 and N6 -N8, i.e. those with the lower value of the aspect ratio . For these 
conditions, experimental data are available from Diaz et al. (200 6). The agreement between 
simulation and experiment for this quantity is very good.

A possible origin of the deviations between simulations and experiments , which are found 
for the gas fractions at higher values of the gas volume flux and the higher value of the 
aspect ratio in Figure 5, is the occurrence of coalescence b etween the bubbles. This effect 
would increase with the gas volume flux due to the higher gas fraction. Also it would be 
more pronounced at higher aspect ratio since then the residence time of the bubbles is 
higher. Unfortunately, measurements of the distr ibution of the bubbles size at different 
heights of the column, which could unambiguously prove the occurrence of bubble 
coalescence, are not available. In the simulations this effect has been neglected to a first 
approximation, because models to describe it are not well -established as of yet. This is 
largely due to a general lack of the kind of data just mentioned, which are necessary to 
validate such models. Disagreement in the gas fraction near the inlet in Figure 5 can be 
attributed to a shortcoming in the inlet conditions.  
An explanation of the deviations for the liquid velocities in Figure 2 is not obvious. This 
deviation is particularly surprising in view of the good agreement of the gas fractions fo r 
these experimental conditions and the fact that the deviations for the gas velocities in  
Figure 4 point in the other direction, i.e. a too high rather than too low value near the 
sidewalls of the column. The gas velocity being too high near the column walls in turn is at 
least consistent wi th the too broad gas fraction profile identified above as a possible 
consequence of the occurrence of bubble coalescence.  
Comparison can also be made with the simulations of Buwa et al. (2002) based on a model 
quite similar to the present one. For case N1,  these previous simulations also gave good 
agreement for the gas fractions, but the liquid velocity there was underpredicted , rather 
than overpredicted , by a similar amount. The good agreement of the gas fraction profile 
suggests that differences in the mo dels applied for the non -drag forces are of minor 
importance. Differences in the bubble -induced turbulence modeling causing a different 
profile of turbulent viscosity thus remain as  a likely cause for the deviations  in the liquid 
velocity . 
 Plume oscillatio n period  4.2
For all considered test cases t he period of plume oscillations (POP) was determined fr om 
the simulation results by averaging the time interval between zero crossings in a time series 
of the x -component of the liquid velocity at a point in the cent er of the column cross section 
at height 𝑦= 250 mm . A comparison with various  experimental results is shown in Figure 8, 
in the left part for an aspect ratio 𝐻/𝐷= 2.25  and in the right part for 𝐻/𝐷= 4.5 in the 
present simulations. In the latter case , the experiments of Buwa and Ranade  (2002) were 
taken at a slightly different value 𝐻/𝐷= 5.5. Results from the previous study (Krauß and 
Rzehak, 2018) comparing simulation results  based on the same model as in  the present 
work to experimental data  on the plume oscillations at 𝐻/𝐷= 5.0 from  Darm ana et al . 
(2007) are also included.  
Compared to the perforated plate sparger data from different sources at the lower value of 
the aspect ratio, there is quite good agreement for all values of 𝐽𝐺 within the range of 
experimental uncertainty evidenced b y the deviations between the different experimental 
data sets. At the lowest values of 𝐽𝐺, an error in the reported value of the gas volume flux 
could also be important since the dependence is rather steep. Compared to the sintered  15 disc sparger , which pr oduces smaller bubbles , agreement is good for the lower values of 𝐽𝐺, 
but the simulation tends to underpredict the experimental data for 𝐽𝐺≥0.4. In this range 
also a different behavior between the two sparger types becomes visible in the 
experimental data : For the sintered disc sparger the POP tends to a constant value while it 
continually decreases for the perforated plate sparger.  This behavior  was explained by Buwa 
and Ranade  (2002) by visual observations showing that the sintered disc sparger at hi gher 
flow rates produced very much larger bubbles than the perforated plate sparger. Moreover , 
it was suggested that this is due to coalescence near the sparger.  This explanation again 
matches the present simulation results, where coalescence is neglected,  but due to the lack 
of data on the bubble size distribution a direct verification is not feasible.   
Comparing experimental data for the POP at different values of the aspect ratio it was noted 
by Buwa and Ranade  (2004) that there is only a small influence at least in the range of 
parameters considered herein. This conclusion is confirmed by the present simulations, 
which give similar results for both values of the aspect ratio considered. Neglecting the 
small dif ference between the setups, good agreement between the present simulations and 
the experiment is also found for the higher value  of the aspect ratio . Only the previous 
simulations of (Krauß and Rzehak, 2018) show a significant deviation from all other tren ds.

 16 5 CONCLUSIONS  
A series of previous works to validate a single set of closure models for different bubbly 
flows has been extended to the case of an oscillating bubble plume as an example of a time -
dependent flow. The overall agreement with the available experimental data  was found 
quite go od, in particular for the plume oscillation period.  Part of the observed deviations 
could be due to the fact that a monodisperse approximation has been used for the 
simulations and bubble coalescence was neglected. Models needed to inclu de such effects 
have not yet reached a stage where they can be relied on  (Liao et al. 2015) . In part this is 
due to the unavailability of data that resolve the bubble size distribution at different heights 
of a bubble column. Additional potential for model  improvement is seen in the accurate 
description of bubble -induced turbulence.  Despite the obvious possibilities for 
improvement, the proposed hydrodynamic closure models  form a suitable basis to include 
further effects such as mass transfer (e.g. Rzehak 2016) and chemical reactions (e.g. Krauß 
and Rzehak 2017) for which there is a strong desire from the application side.
