558 © 2009 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinhei m Laccases belong to the multicopper oxidase (MCO) 
family of enzymes [1]. Most MCOs contain ~500 
amino acid residues and are typically composed of 
three Greek key β-barrel cupredoxin domains (do- 
mains 1, 2 and 3) that come together to form three 
spectroscopically distinct types of Cu sites, i.e ., 
type 1 (T1), type 2 (T2), and type 3 (T3) [2, 3]. T1 
copper (“blue copper”) is a mononuclear catalytic 
center involved in substrate oxidation, whereas T2 
and T3 form a trinuclear center involved in dioxy- 
gen reduction to water. These enzymes are able to 
oxidize a range of aromatic substrates such as 
polyphenols, methoxy-substituted phenols, di- amines and even some inorganic compounds re- 
ducing dioxygen to water [4]. Owing to their rela- 
tively high nonspecific oxidation capacity , laccases
have been found to be useful biocatalysts for di- 
verse biotechnological applications including the 
detoxification of industrial effluents, mostly from 
the paper and pulp, textile and petrochemical in- 
dustries, and, as a bioremediation agent to clean up 
herbicides, pesticides and certain explosives in soi l 
[4–6]. Furthermore, laccases can be used in organ- 
ic synthesis, as they can perform exquisite trans- 
formations ranging from the oxidation of steroid 
hormones or heteromolecular coupling for the pro- 
duction of new antibiotics derivatives to the enzy-
matic polymerization required for the synthesis of 
phenolic-based resins or water-soluble polymers

Laccases are useful biocatalysts for many diverse b iotechnological applications. In this study we 
have established efficient and reliable expression systems and high-throughput screenings for the 
recombinant CotA-laccase from Bacillus subtilis . The expression levels of cotA-laccase were com- 
pared in five different Escherichia coli host strains growing in 96-well microtiter plates u nder differ- 
ent culture conditions. Lower coefficients of varia nce (around 15%) were achieved using crude cell 
lysates of BL21 and KRX host strains growing under m icroaerobic conditions. Reproducible high- 
throughput screenings for the decolorization of hig h redox potential azo and anthraquinonic dyes 
were developed and optimized for identification of variants with increased redox potential. The en- 
zymatic assays developed were tested for the screen ing of one mutant library from CotA-laccase 
created by error-prone PCR.

substrate oxidation in these enzymes involves the 
Marcus “outer-sphere” mechanism in which the re- 
dox potential difference between the substrate and 
the T1 Cu site in laccases (together with the reor-
ganization energy and the transmission coeffi- 
cient) determines the electron transfer and thus, 
the oxidation rate [3, 7–11]. The redox potentials 
exhibited by the T1 copper sites of laccases span 
over a broad range of values, from 400 mV for plant 
laccases to 790 mV for some fungal laccases [1, 3]. 
The reasons for the wide potential range are not ye t 
fully understood, but it is known that it is influ- 
enced by a variety of factors, including the solvent
accessibility of the metal center and the electro- 
static interactions between this center and the pro - 
tein [3]. Most of the site-directed mutagenesis at 
the T1 Cu site of laccases have highlighted the lim - 
itation of rational approaches towards the modula- 
tion of the redox potential [12–17] and thus, en- 
courage, as an alternative, the application of direct - 
ed evolution techniques for this purpose. Directed 
evolution has been very successful in engineering 
proteins with altered substrate specificity , im- 
proved activity , affinity , thermostability , solvent st a- 
bility or protein folding [18–25], and at the same 
time represents a complementary approach to 
structure-based protein design strategies [26]. 
CotA-laccase from Bacillus subtilis , our model 
system, is a suitable platform for a molecular evo- 
lution protocol, since it has the predictable robust - 
ness for the destabilizing conformational changes 
needed to accommodate beneficial functional mu- 
tations through evolution [28–30]. It is produced in
high yields in E. coli [27, 28], the preferred host or- 
ganism due to the ease of genetic manipulation, 
availability of efficient genetic tools, high transf or- 
mation efficiency and stability of plasmid DNA. 
Furthermore, the evolution studies on laccases are 
still scarce and based only on two fungal systems 
[20–24] and there are reasonable expectations for 
the occurrence of a high frequency of beneficial 
random mutations towards a higher redox poten- 
tial considering its relatively low value (525 mV vs .
SHE [27]) in CotA-laccase.To address the evolution 
of CotA-laccase for a higher redox potential, a 
strategy of mutagenesis and screening was delin- 
eated. Low-error-rate random-mutagenesis PCR, 
which explores sequence space efficiently , was 
chosen as a method for generating molecular di- 
versity .Taking into consideration that the redox po - 
tentials of variant enzymes from directed evolution
libraries cannot be screened directly in crude cell
lysates, several high-throughput screenings 
(HTSs) were developed for a group of high redox 
potential, structurally diverse, synthetic dyes. It isexpected that the combination of HTS for these 
dyes would allow for the indirect identification of
enzyme variants with increased redox potential. In 
this study , the protocol for the production of bacte - 
rial CotA-laccase by E. coli in 96-well microtiter 
plates (MTPs) was optimized and the development 
of effective HTS assays for standard laccase sub- 
strates and for selected high redox potential dyes 
was pursued. Furthermore, we assessed an error- 
prone PCR mutant library with the methodologies 
developed. 
The growth of the recombinant E. coli Tuner 
strain expressing the cotA-laccase gene (strain 
AH3517 [28]) was tested in 96-well MTPs in differ- 
ent aeration conditions. A pre-culture started from 
isolated colonies was grown in 96-well MTPs con- 
taining 200 µL Luria-Bertani (LB) medium supple- 
mented with 100 µg/mL ampicillin, at 30ºC and 
600 rpm. For cultivation, 20 µL of 24-h pre-cultures 
(shorter periods affected negatively the homo- 
geneity of final cultures ODs) were dispensed into 
new 96-well MTPs containing 180 µL culture medi- 
um with antibiotic and cultivated until the OD 600 nm 
reached values of ~0.6. At this time, the tempera- 
ture was reduced to 25°C, the medium was supple- 
mented with 250 µM CuCl 2 and cotA-laccase ex- 
pression was induced with 100 µM isopropyl 
β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Different aera- 
tion conditions were tested: (i) aerobic (shaking at 
600 rpm), (ii) microaerobic (switching off the shak- 
er 4 h after induction [27]) and (iii) anaerobic (sta t- 
ic). After 24 h of cultivation the 96-well MTPs were 
centrifuged for 30 min at 3500 ×g, 4°C.The cell sed- 
iments were suspended in 40 µL B-PER lysis solu- 
tion (Bacterial Protein Extraction Reagent, Pierce),
adjusted to 100 µL with 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, 
pH 7.6, and centrifuged for 30 min at 4000 ×g, 4°C. 
The resulting crude cell lysates were used for pro-
tein determination by the Bradford assay [31] or 
enzymatic activity measurements performed on a 
Synergy2 (BioTek) microplate reader at 37°C using 
the classical phenolic and non-phenolic laccase 
substrates 2,2’-azino bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoli- 
ne-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) or 2,6-dimethoxyphe- 
nol (2,6-DMP), respectively [16]. The assay mix- 
tures contained undiluted lysates (1:10 dilution) i n 
Britton and Robinson buffer and crude cell lysates 
(1:10 dilution) and reactions were initiated by 
adding the substrate at a final concentration of 
1 mM. Reactions with ABTS were performed at 
pH 4 and followed at 420 nm ( ε= 36 000 M –1 cm –1 ), 
while reactions with 2,6-DMP were performed at 
pH 7 and followed at 468 nm ( ε= 49 600 M –1 cm –1 ). 
We found that the final OD 600 nm of cultures were 
similar after growth in aerobic (1.04 ± 0.22), mi- 
croaerobic (0.85 ± 0.15) or anaerobic conditions Biotechnol. J. 2009, 4, 558–563 www.biotechnology-journal.com Biotechnology

impact on the yield of recombinant active enzyme 
expressed per cell as it is shown in Fig. 1. In cells
grown under aerobic conditions no activity could 
be detected in crude extracts in contrast to anaero - 
bic or microaerobic cultures.This is presumably re-
lated with the copper content of the produced re- 
combinant enzyme, which was shown to be strictly 
dependent on culture aeration conditions as previ- 
ously described [27]. The reproducibility of cotA- 
laccase expression system was tested in four 
96-well MTPs using a liquid handling robot (Micro- 
lab Starlet, Hamilton) by measuring the total pro- 
tein content and the enzymatic activities for ABTS 
and 2,6-DMP in crude extracts of AH3517 cells 
grown under microaerobic conditions. In these 
conditions, a very high (25%) coefficient of varianc e 
(CV) was found with either 2,6-DMP and ABTS 
(Table 1). To correctly interpret the upcoming 
screening data and reduce the probability of miss- 
ing positive variants, the variability of cotA-laccase 
expression was tested in additional recombinant E. 
coli strains: the plasmid pLOM10 coding for the 
cotA-laccase gene was transformed into strain 
BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) producing strain 
LOM446, KRX (Promega) producing strain 
LOM447, strain Rosetta(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) 
producing strain LOM504 and strain Origami 
(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) producing strain LOM505. 
The expression of cotA-laccase is under the control 
of the strong T7 lac promoter, induced upon addi- 
tion of IPTG, in all strains with the exception of 
LOM447 strain, where recombinant gene expres- 
sion is under the control of promoter rha PBAD , in- 
duced by rhamnose. The lower variances for HTS 
were obtained with crude cell lysates of LOM446 
and LOM447 strains (Table 1). The CV of 14–15% 
achieved are expected to allow variants to be iden-
tified with at least twofold improved activity [32] . 
The decision to continue with LOM447 strain was 
based on its higher transformation efficiency when 
compared with strain LOM446, besides its features 
of cloning and expression strain, which avoided an additional step of plasmid transference among 
strains in the evolution process. 
HTS for dye decolorization were optimized us- 
ing crude cell lysates of strain LOM447 and a group
of structurally diverse dyes that are substrates of
the enzyme (Fig. 2, [33]). We selected three groups 
of dyes: (i) Sudan Orange G, Reactive Black 5 and 
Acid Blue 62 that are bleached with a high efficien - 
cy (85–98%) by the purified enzyme; (ii) Direct 
Black 38, Reactive Red R and Reactive Red 4 that 
present a intermediary susceptibility (38–60%) to 
degradation, and (iii) Disperse Yellow 3 that is 
hardly decolorized (8%).Table 2 shows that all dyes 
present a high redox potential as estimated from 
oxidation peaks in cyclic voltammograms. The de- 
colorization was followed in four 96-well MTPs, in 
the absence and presence of 5 µM ABTS, by meas- 
uring changes in the absorbance at the maximum 
wavelength of each dye for 24 h (Fig. 3).The aim of 
adding ABTS to the reaction mixtures was to in- 
crease the rate of decolorization [33]. The rate and
the percentage of decolorization were calculated 
and a low CV of 4–7% was achieved. 
We have used a library of variants of the whole 
cotA-laccase gene created by epPCR to validate the 
HTS developed. Mutazyme II polymerase (Gen-

0.5 min at 55°C, 1 min at 72°C were performed.The 
pool of PCR-mutated cotA (1539 bp) was digested 
with Dpn I from Fermentas (St. Leon-Rot, Ger- 
many), purified using the GFX PCR DNA and Gel 
Band Purification Kit (GE Healthcare) and cloned 
into vector pLOM10 using the restriction sites Nhe I
and Xho I. To avoid the re-cloning of the wild type 
(WT) caused by incomplete restriction and re-liga- 
tion of pLOM10, the 1539 bp DNA fragment coding 
for amino acids residues 1–513 of CotA-laccase 
were previously removed from pLOM10 by diges- 
tion with Nhe I and Xho I followed by insertion of a 
ΩSm/Sp cassette from plasmid pHRP316 [34] into 
the same sites. The ΩSm/Sp cassette was removed 
by enzymatic cleavage and the vector was recov- 
ered from agarose gel using the QIAquick Gel Ex- 
traction Kit from Qiagen and used to clone the pool
of mutated DNA. The resulting plasmid was trans- 
formed into E. coli KRX strain. The DNA sequence 
analysis of 12 variants chosen randomly showed a 
mutation rate between 0-5, very close to the ex- 
pected 0-4.5. Figure 4 shows the result of the mu- 
tant library screening (around 1800 clones) using 
the ABTS activity assay , plotted in order of decreas - 
ing activity . Around 4% of all clones screened (60 
clones) present 1.5-2.5-fold higher activities than
the parent strain and 53% of variants exhibit less 
than 10% of the parent enzyme activity . A 
re-screening with freshly transformed cells was 
performed to get a correct comparison of clones 
and discard false-positives to identify a few preli m- 
inary “winners” (Table 3). Two mutations (K461M 
and K351N) were found at the surface of the en- 
zyme far from the Cu catalytic sites, while muta- 
tions I369T , K373N and L386F are closer to the T1 
Cu center; e.g ., K373 is 14 Å and L386 5 Å from T1 
Cu [35]. Since we are introducing 0–4 mutations in emorph kit II, Stratagene) was selected to catalyze 
the mutagenic PCR, since libraries created using 
this enzyme produce a low-biased mutation spec- 
trum, with equivalent mutation rates at AT base 
pairs versus GC base pairs.The manufacture proto- 
col for a low mutation rate (0-4.5 mutations/kb) was
followed with minor modifications. The primers 
used for amplification were: Fwd-CotA (5’-ATA-

we will continue to screen this library to cover a 
higher diversity of mutants created and to select 
the most suitable mutant for parenting the next 
generation of random mutagenesis. We will addi- 
tionally focus the random mutagenesis in a shorter 
selected region of CotA-laccase, domain 3 that con- 
tains the catalytic T1 Cu site, contributes to the 
properties of the T2/T3 Cu center and includes the 
putative substrate binding site [35]; this would in-
crease the chances of an efficient library screenin g. 
Interestingly , all the mutations found in the HTS 
are localized at the end of domain 2 or in domain 3 
of the enzyme. 
The key to designing directed enzyme evolution 
strategies, a purpose of current work in our labora-tory , is the establishment of efficient expression 
and screening systems that accommodates the pre- 
dicted diversity generated by the mutagenesis or 
combinatorial techniques, and thus it is expected 
that the future outcome of this study will lead to the 
generation of CotA-laccase variants with improved 
biotechnological effectiveness and versatility 
and/or to a better insight over the structure-func-
tion relationships in the MCO family of enzymes.
