IBS Irritable bowel syndrome2The Clinical Guide to Probiotic Products Available in Canada
This Guide is a practice tool to assist with clinical decision-making for appropriate 
probiotic therapy for your patients. 
It is designed to translate scientific evidence available for probiotic products to 
practical, clinically relevant information. It is intended to be used as a clinical decision-
making tool, enabling clinicians to easily select the appropriate product, dose, and 
formulation for a specific indication.
Our aim is to ensure that the appropriate product/strain is selected for the desired 
outcome. This Clinical Guide is not meant to be interpreted as a systematic review, or 
a “clinical practice guideline,” nor is it an endorsement for companies to market health 
claims.
Currently, the body of evidence for probiotic interventions is growing along with 
popular demand for these products. There is evidence to support the use of probiotic 
products for a variety of indications beyond gut health, however, applications and results 
are strain-specific.
Due to frequent changes in the commercial availability of probiotic strains, new 
published evidence, and growing research, an annual review and updates of this Clinical 
Guide have been conducted since 2008. A general lack of adverse effects attributable to 
probiotics supports the widespread use of these products, but an ongoing investigation 
is recommended.3How is the Guide Reviewed?
A systematic literature review using pre-defined inclusion criteria was undertaken to 
identify studies of defined clinical outcomes for specific probiotic strain(s). Commercially 
available products containing said strain(s) were identified, and the levels of evidence 
were used to rate the strength of the expected benefit. This information was compiled 
into a chart format. Data was assessed by a group of independent expert reviewers. 
In the case of probiotics, the clinical evidence must be linked to specific formulations 
as defined by genus, species, alphanumeric designation or strain, number of live 
bacteria present, the blend of probiotic strains present, and finally, non-active 
ingredients present. 
Every attempt was made to include the published clinical data for the available 
probiotic formulations. 
To avoid selection bias toward any specific formulation, we have conducted a literature 
search of two databases (PubMed, EMBASE) and contacted our independent experts to 
identify any published or unpublished studies.4Why are only a Limited Number of Products Included?
All of the inclusion criteria listed must be satisfied for a product to be listed in the Guide: 
1.  Commercially available in Canada as a supplement or probiotic-containing food. 
2.  Generally Recognized as Safe status (FDA) and/or Natural Product Number   
  (Health Canada) for probiotic strain(s) used in the products. 
3.  Favourable published clinical evidence for the particular strain(s) present in each   
  product. 
4.  For products containing multiple strains, evidence must be for the specified   
  combination and NOT extrapolated from the evidence for the separate probiotic 
  strains.
Note:  Some products are excluded from the current edition due to changes in the strains used.  
Clinical Pear l: Indications for use are based on specific strains or combinations studied together.  
Caution: Extrapolation of current data and recommendations to be applied for different combinations 
of probiotic strains is not permitted.5Level of Recommendation:  
 
Level I Evidence obtained from at least one appropriately designed trial (e.g. randomization, blinding, appropriate population 
comparisons) with a power calculation for the outcome(s) of interest.  
The expert review board reserves the right to make the final decision for the level of recommendation. (HIGHEST LEVEL)
Level II Evidence obtained from well-designed controlled trials without randomization; evidence obtained from randomized trials not 
satisfying all criteria listed in Level I. Evidence obtained from well-designed cohort or case-control analytic studies, preferably 
from more than one center or research group.  
Evidence obtained from multiple time series with or without the intervention. Dramatic results in uncontrolled trials might also be 
regarded as this type of evidence.
Level III Opinions of respected authorities, based on clinical experience, descriptive studies, or reports of expert committees. 
 
Readers are strongly encouraged to review the evidence listed for each product for themselves.  
Please refer to individual publications for specifics of patient populations studied (e.g. age, gender, comorbidities) and details of 
clinical effect (statistical significance, size of treatment effect, precision of the confidence intervals).6
