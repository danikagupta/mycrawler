Introduction
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) comprises 
a group of malignancies that are common 
in industrialized countries. Studies of occu -
pational risk factors have proven valuable 
for generating hypotheses regarding the  possible environmental causes of NHL, and 
over the past four decades, these studies 
have produced a number of strong leads 
(Schottenfeld and Fraumeni 2006). In 
particular, occupations involving exposure to 
pesticides and solvents have been repeatedly associated with NHL. Other occupational 
risk factors have been hypothesized; these 
include infectious agents, sunlight, organic 
dusts (including flour dust, textile dust, 
and wood dust), mineral dusts, metals, and 
ionizing radiation. Nevertheless, even repeat -
edly observed associations (e.g., employment 
as farmer) have not been entirely consistent  
across studies. A well-deﬁned set of occupa -
tions and potential exposures relevant to 
NHL etiology has yet to be established.
Among the potential reasons for the lack  
of consistency in previous ﬁndings is the idea 
that individual case–control studies lack the 
power to provide stable estimates of relative 
risk for less-common occupations and are 
susceptible to chance findings because of 
the large number of occupations evaluated. 
Studies differ somewhat in how occupa -
tional details are recorded, coded, analyzed,

BACKGROUND : Various occupations have been associated with an elevated risk of non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma (NHL), but results have been inconsistent across studies.
OBJECTIVES : We investigated occupational risk of NHL and of four common NHL subtypes with 
particular focus on occupations of a priori  interest.
METHODS : We conducted a pooled analysis of 10,046 cases and 12,025 controls from 10 NHL 
studies participating in the InterLymph Consortium. We harmonized the occupational coding 
using the 1968 International Standard Classiﬁcation of Occupations (ISCO-1968) and grouped 
occupations previously associated with NHL into 25 a priori  groups. Odds ratios (ORs) adjusted 
for center, age, and sex were determined for NHL overall and for the following four subtypes: 
diﬀuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia/
small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL).
RESULTS : We conﬁrmed previously reported positive associations between NHL and farming occupa -
tions [ﬁeld crop/vegetable farm workers OR  = 1.26; 95% conﬁdence interval (CI): 1.05,  1.51; general 
farm workers OR  = 1.19; 95%  CI: 1.03,  1.37]; we also conﬁrmed associations of NHL with speciﬁc 
occupations such as women’s hairdressers (OR  = 1.34; 95%  CI: 1.02,  1.74), charworkers/cleaners 
(OR = 1.17; 95%  CI: 1.01,  1.36), spray-painters (OR  = 2.07; 95%  CI: 1.30,  3.29), electrical wiremen 
(OR = 1.24; 95%  CI: 1.00,  1.54), and carpenters (OR  = 1.42; 95%  CI: 1.04,  1.93). We observed 
subtype-speciﬁc associations for DLBCL and CLL/SLL in women’s hairdressers and for DLBCL and 
PTCL in textile workers.
CONCLUSIONS : Our pooled analysis of 10 international studies adds to evidence suggesting that 
farming, hairdressing, and textile industry–related exposures may contribute to NHL risk. Associations 
with women’s hairdresser and textile occupations may be speciﬁc for certain NHL subtypes.

Environmental Health Perspectives  • VOLUME  124 | NUMBER  4 | April  2016 397and reported, making comparison difficult, 
and they may not be comparable in terms 
of the NHL subtypes included and tumor 
classiﬁcations used. Finally, there may be true 
differences in risk associated with the same 
occupation across different study regions 
owing to local differences in population 
characteristics, exposure patterns, and NHL 
subtype distribution.
To determine the extent of agreement 
with previous findings in the large pooled 
dataset of InterLymph consortium studies, 
we conducted an analysis of occupations in 
relation to NHL using a uniform classiﬁca -
tion of occupations and NHL pathology. Our 
aims were a) to confirm the relationship of 
occupations of a priori  interest to NHL and 
its subtypes, and b) to estimate the contribu -
tion of speciﬁc occupations of a priori  interest 
to the incidence of NHL and its subtypes.
Methods
Study population.  Included in our analyses 
were 10 NHL case–control studies that 
participate in the InterLymph consortium, 
had collected information on occupation 
from cases and controls, and were willing to 
contribute their data to the pooled analysis (see Table  1 for the acronyms used to refer 
to each study, details about study designs and 
locations, and citations to general references 
for each study). The InterLymph consor -
tium of international investigators under -
takes research projects to pool data across 
studies that explore the etiology of lymphoid 
malignancies. The set of harmonized core 
variables, including age, sex, study center 
(region), smoking status, and NHL subtype, 
was directly obtained from the InterLymph 
data coordinating center. Variables on occu -
pational history were obtained from the 
principal investigators of each participating 
study. We applied the lymphoma classiﬁcation 
scheme for epidemiologic research developed 
by InterLymph investigators (Morton et  al. 
2007) to all participating InterLymph studies. 
All cases classiﬁed as “lymphoid neoplasms” 
according to this classiﬁcation, except multiple 
myeloma and Hodgkin lymphoma, were 
included in this analysis.
Occupational history.  For the purpose of 
our pooled analyses, the data on occupation 
were classiﬁed into a standard internationally 
recognized occupational classiﬁcation scheme, 
the International Standard Classification of 
Occupations 1968 (ISCO-68) [International Labour O ﬃce (ILO) 1981]. Depending on the 
original occupational classiﬁcation used by the 
individual studies and on whether a full-text 
description of the occupation was available, 
the ISCO-68 code for each job recorded was 
determined by one of the following methods: 
a) a direct conversion of the original classiﬁca -
tion to the ISCO-68 classiﬁcation (for the Yale 
and UCSF1 studies); b) a direct conversion 
from the original classiﬁcation to the ISCO-68 
classiﬁcation followed by checking the correct -
ness of each ISCO-68 code by comparing it 
with the free-text information on the occu -
pation (for the NCI-SEER study); c) using 
the free-text information on the occupation 
to individually assign the ISCO-68 code (for 
the BC, Nebraska, UK, and NSW studies); 
or d) directly using the original occupational 
codes for those studies that used ISCO-68 as 
their original classiﬁcation (for the Epilymph, 
Italy, and ENGELA studies). Eight of the 10 
studies collected the full occupational history 
of cases and controls including all occupations 
held for at least 1  year and starting and ending 
years, and 2 studies (Nebraska, BC) recorded 
only the longest-held occupation.
We deﬁned occupational groups of a priori  
interest for NHL based on the peer-reviewed

three of the authors (A.’tM., A.J.D., R.V.), 
25 occupational groups were constructed that 
included jobs associated with NHL in previous 
studies other than the 10 case–control studies 
included in our pooled analysis.We also studied occupations within 
a group separately up to the detail of the 
5-digit ISCO-68 code to explore whether 
an association was restricted to specific 
occupations within the group. For example, 
crop farmers were studied as a group, and specific occupations within this group such 
as orchard farmers and rice farmers were also 
studied separately.

Environmental Health Perspectives  • VOLUME  124 | NUMBER  4 | April  2016 399the association between NHL and occupations 
in the pooled data set in models adjusted for 
age, sex, and study center. For each a priori  
occupational group and individual ISCO-68 
occupation defined by a 1-digit, 2-digit, 
3-digit, and 5-digit code, a dichotomous 
variable was created for ever having worked in 
that occupation. Duration of employment was 
coded as <  1 year, 1–10  years, and >  10 years 
in the occupation. Smoking status (never/
former/current) was considered as a potential 
confounder, but adjusting for smoking made no substantial difference to the relative risk 
estimates (data not shown); consequently, 
smoking was not included as a covariate.
Analyses were performed for all NHL 
combined (excluding Hodgkin lymphoma 
and multiple myeloma) and separately for 
each of four major NHL subtypes [diffuse 
large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular 
lymphoma (FL), chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma 
(CLL/SLL), and peripheral T-cell lymphoma 
(PTCL)]; the same set of controls that was used for all NHL combined was used for 
each subtype. Two studies did not include 
CLL/SLL (UCSF1; UK) and were excluded 
from all CLL/SLL–specific analyses. All 
analyses were repeated stratified by sex. All 
statistical tests were two-sided with a signiﬁ -
cance level of 0.05. The Nebraska and BC 
studies included longest-held occupation only 
and were excluded from analyses of duration 
but were included in analyses of ever employ -
ment because their exclusion made little 
 diﬀerence to the results.

400 VOLUME  124 | NUMBER  4 | April  2016 • Environmental Health PerspectivesPolytomous regression was used to test 
whether di ﬀerences in ORs by NHL subtype 
were statistically significant at p < 0.05; we 
tested for heterogeneity in effect across the 
four subtypes (DLBCL, FL, CLL/SLL, PTCL) 
based on data for ever employment in the occu -
pation with both sexes combined. We tested for 
heterogeneity among studies using Cochran’s 
chi-squared test or the Q-test (Higgins and 
Thompson 2002); there was no evidence of 
significant heterogeneity (data not shown). 
To identify those associations with the largest 
potential impact on NHL incidence under 
the assumption of causality and in the absence 
of confounding, we calculated a population 
attributable fraction (AF) for occupations in 
which 1% or more of cases had ever worked 
and that were associated with an increased 
relative risk. The formula for AF calculation 
used the prevalence of ever employment in each 
occupation in controls as an estimate of popula -
tion prevalence: prevalence controls  × (OR – 1)/
[1 + prevalence controls (OR  – 1)] (Last 
et al. 1995).
Criteria for presentation of results.  The 
present analysis involved many specific 
occupations within the 25 a priori  groups 
for which previous research demonstrated an 
association with an increased relative risk of 
NHL: 925 of >  2,000 relevant codes in the 
ISCO-68 classiﬁcation were involved in this 
analysis. We set criteria to determine which 
associations to include in the results. We 
present results for ever employment and for 
> 10 years employment for all NHL and each 
of the four subtypes for each occupational 
group of a priori  interest regardless of whether 
the estimates were statistically significant, 
with the exception of occupational groups 
with <  10 cases or <  10 controls. One occu -
pational group in the analyses of all NHL 
(undertakers) and two groups in the analyses 
of the four subtypes (pulp & paper workers 
and petroleum workers) were excluded from 
the results because they had <  10 cases or <  10 
controls. Additionally, we report associations 
with specific occupational titles included 
within the occupational groups of interest 
if we estimated a statistically signiﬁcant OR 
(> 1.10 or <  0.90, for ever employment or 
> 10 years employment) based on men and 
women combined for all NHL or for any one 
of the four subtypes.
ORs were also calculated for the 1,286 
occupations that were not included in  the 
25 groups of a priori  interest. These results 
are not presented here but are available 
upon request.
Results
The 10 case–control studies included 10,046 
cases and 12,025 controls (Table  1). Of the 
cases, 50% were from Europe, 43% were 
from North America, and 7% were from Australia. The year of diagnosis ranged from 
1988 to 2004, and 52.4% of cases were male. 
The mean  ± standard deviation (SD) age at 
interview was 57.6  ± 12.8 years for cases and 
55.4 ± 14.2 years for controls. The mean year 
of first employment (in the 8 studies with 
full occupational history) was 1959 (±  16 
years; range, 1915–2003) for cases and 1961 
(± 16 years; range, 1912–2002) for controls. 
Of the four subtypes selected for separate 
analyses, DLBCL formed the largest group 
with 3,061 cases (52.4% male), followed by 
FL (2,140 cases; 45.6% male), CLL/SLL 
(1,014 cases; 59.3% male), and PTCL (632 
cases; 56.5% male).
None of the 24 broad occupational 
groups of a priori  interest (see Table  2) had 
a statistically significant positive association 
with NHL for ever employment (Table  3). 
However, one or more speciﬁc titles within 10 
of these 24 groups were positively associated 
with NHL. There were positive associations 
with ever employment in cleaning occupa -
tions for “charworkers, cleaners and related” 
(OR = 1.17; 95%  CI: 1.01,  1.36) and in elec -
trical and electronic occupations for “electrical 
wiremen” (OR  = 1.24; 95%  CI: 1.00,  1.54); 
there were also positive associations with 
> 10 years employment for “electrical ﬁtters 
& related electrical/electronics workers” and 
selected subgroups of these occupations. 
Among farming occupations, ever employ -
ment as “field crop and vegetable farm 
workers” (OR  = 1.26; 95%  CI: 1.05,  1.51) 
and as “general farm workers” (OR  = 1.19; 
95% CI: 1.03,  1.37) had a positive association 
with NHL. Employment of >  10 years as a 
forestry worker was also associated with NHL 
(OR = 2.25; 95%  CI: 1.18,  4.32; 28 cases, 
14 controls). Other positive associations were 
observed for NHL for ever employment as a 
“women’s hairdresser” (OR  = 1.34; 95%  CI: 
1.02,  1.74), among painters as “spray-painters 
(except construction)” (OR  = 2.07; 95%  CI: 
1.30,  3.29), among textile workers as “milli -
ners and hatmakers” (OR  = 2.46; 95%  CI: 
1.28,  4.74), and among woodworker occu -
pations as “general carpenter” (OR  = 1.42; 
95% CI: 1.04,  1.93). Furthermore, >  10 years 
employment was positively associated with 
NHL among medical workers for “medical 
doctors” (OR  = 1.87; 95%  CI: 1.23,  2.85; 57 
cases, 38 controls) and among metal workers 
for “machine-tool operators” (OR  = 1.55; 
95% CI: 1.11,  2.17; 84 cases; 63 controls). 
The occupational group of teachers was 
negatively associated with NHL (OR  = 0.89; 
95%  CI: 0.81,  0.98), as were some of the 
specific occupations within the teachers 
group. Only “head teachers” had a positive 
association with NHL (OR  = 2.16; 95%  CI: 
1.15,  4.06).
Table  4 presents ORs and 95% CIs 
for the four NHL subtypes for both sexes combined. DLBCL, the most common 
subtype, had positive associations with 
the occupational groups of hairdressers 
(OR = 1.47; 95%  CI: 1.08,  2.00; 58 cases, 
158 controls) and textile workers (OR  = 1.19; 
95% CI: 1.01,  1.41; 218 cases, 773 controls) 
as well as with specific occupations within 
these groups (women’s hairdresser, milliners 
and hatmakers, and sewers and embroiderers). 
Positive associations were also observed for 
speciﬁc occupations as “charworkers, cleaners 
and related workers” (OR  = 1.27; 95%  CI: 
1.03,  1.58; 122 cases, 395 controls), “field 
crop & vegetable farm workers” (OR  = 1.50; 
95% CI: 1.15,  1.97; 79 cases, 233 controls) 
and its subgroup “field crop farm worker 
(general)” (OR  = 1.48; 95%  CI: 1.01,  2.17; 
38 cases, 118 controls),  “metal melters and 
reheaters” (OR  = 2.31; 95%  CI: 1.01,  5.26; 
10 cases, 14 controls), and “special education 
teachers” (OR  = 1.94; 95%  CI: 1.01,  3.71; 
14 cases, 24 controls). Forestry workers with 
> 10 years employment also had a positive 
association with DLBCL (OR  = 3.04, 
95% CI: 1.34,  6.90; 10 cases, 14 controls).
Positive associations were present for 
FL with speciﬁc occupations such as “spray-
painter (except construction)” (OR  = 2.67; 
95%  CI: 1.36,  5.25; 13 cases, 29 controls) 
and with >  10 years employment as a 
“medical doctor” (OR  = 2.23, 95%  CI: 
1.17,  4.26; 13 cases, 38 controls).
CLL/SLL was associated with ever employ -
ment in the occupational group of hairdressers 
(OR = 1.79; 95%  CI: 1.06,  3.03; 18 cases, 
130 controls), both for the specific occupa -
tion “women’s hairdresser” as well as for 
> 10 years employment in the occupational 
group of hairdressers (OR  = 2.09, 95%  CI: 
1.01,  4.34; 10 cases, 40 controls). We 
observed positive associations with CLL/SLL 
for speciﬁc occupations such as “general farm 
worker” (OR  = 1.44; 95%  CI: 1.13,  1.84; 
102 cases, 399 controls), printing pressmen 
(OR = 6.52; 95%  CI: 2.79,  15.21; 10 cases, 
19 controls), “pre-primary education teachers” 
(OR = 2.00; 95%  CI: 1.04,  3.87; 11 cases, 111 
controls) and carpenters (OR  = 2.10; 95%  CI: 
1.08,  4.09; 13 cases, 69 controls). CLL/SLL 
was also associated with >  10 years employ -
ment as machine tool operators (OR  = 1.96; 
95% CI: 1.04,  3.69; 15 cases, 46 controls).
Three occupational groups had positive 
associations with PTCL: ever employment 
as painters (OR  = 1.80; 95%  CI: 1.14,  2.84; 
22 cases, 221 controls), textile workers 
(OR = 1.60; 95%  CI: 1.18, 2.17; 56 cases, 
773 controls), and wood workers (OR  = 1.54; 
95% CI: 1.04,  2.27; 31 cases, 352 controls); 
the last two occupational groups also had 
increased ORs for >  10 years employment. 
Specific textile occupations associated with 
PTCL included “spinners, weavers, knitters, 
dyers and related workers” (OR  = 1.85; Occupation and risk of NHL
Environmental Health Perspectives  • VOLUME  124 | NUMBER  4 | April  2016 40195% CI: 1.21,  2.83; 27 cases, 313 controls) 
and “tailors, dressmakers, sewers, upholsterers 
and related workers” (>  10 year OR  = 2.29, 
95% CI: 1.38,  3.77, 19 cases, 183 controls). 
The specific wood worker occupation asso -
ciated with PTCL was “cabinet makers” 
(OR = 2.41; 95%  CI: 1.22,  4.74; 10 cases, 81 controls). PTCL was also associated with 
“electrical ﬁtters” (ever employed OR  = 2.02; 
95% CI: 1.03,  3.97; 10 cases, 92 controls).
Evidence of heterogeneity in relative risks 
(p < 0.05, Q-test for heterogeneity) across the 
four NHL subtypes was present for “women’s 
hairdressers,” metal workers, “printing pressmen,” textile workers, and “cabinet -
makers” (Table  4). “Printing pressmen,” 
however, had very small numbers of cases 
and controls (<  10) for all analyses except 
for CLL/SLL.
Attributable fraction.  We estimated the

402 VOLUME  124 | NUMBER  4 | April  2016 • Environmental Health Perspectiveswas attributable to the main occupational 
groups (farmers, textile workers, hairdressers, 
wood workers, painters) or to specific occu -
pations (e.g., “women’s hairdressers,” “spray-
painters”) for which an elevated relative risk had 
been observed ( p < 0.05). AFs for NHL were 
low, between 0.3% for “women’s hairdressers” and 0.63% for “general farm workers,” and 
were somewhat higher for the rarer individual 
subtypes: 1.49% for “women’s hairdressers” 
and CLL/SLL and ≥ 3.69% for the textile 
worker group and PTCL. AFs di ﬀered by sex in 
a number of occupations, reﬂecting the scarcity 
of men or women in a particular occupation.Discussion
We found evidence that NHL was associ -
ated with employment as textile workers, 
hairdressers, and farm workers, as well as 
with employment as painters, printers, wood 
workers, metal workers, medical workers, elec -

Environmental Health Perspectives  • VOLUME  124 | NUMBER  4 | April  2016 403significant heterogeneity in relative risk 
estimates among subtypes suggested that 
employment as “women’s hairdressers” was 
particularly associated with DLBCL and 
CLL/SLL and employment as textile workers 
with DLBCL and PTCL.
Our pooled analysis used a uniform 
classification of NHL diagnosis and was 
substantially larger than any individual study. 
A limitation of our study is that grouping 
workers according to job title disregards the 
wide qualitative and quantitative variation in 
exposure that may occur for workers with the 
same job title (McGuire et  al. 1998). Even if 
an association between job title and disease 
is found, the potentially causative agents 
are unknown, although they are likely to be 
common rather than rare exposures within the 
occupational group. The international nature 
of this study also implies that only associations 
for occupations with internationally compa -
rable exposure profiles can be detected and 
that some misclassiﬁcation will be introduced 
owing to the recoding of di ﬀerent occupational 
classiﬁcations into a single one. An advantage 
of using job titles rather than specific expo -
sures is that recall by participants is less likely 
to be inﬂuenced by their disease status, making 
differential misclassification also less likely. 
The multiple comparisons of a job title–based 
approach, however, suggest a vulnerability to 
false positive findings. Results are therefore 
focused on the a priori –selected occupational 
groups (24 were eligible) extracted from 
earlier NHL research. We discuss below the 
findings from our study that are consistent 
with previously reported associations, and we 
also discuss occupational exposures that might 
be  implicated as etiologic agents.
We confirmed the previously reported 
association of NHL with crop farming occu -
pations (Blair et  al. 1992; Keller-Byrne et  al. 
1997), but not with animal farming (Amadori 
et al. 1995; Bo ﬀetta and de Vocht 2007; Lee 
et al. 2002), which was negatively associated 
with CLL/SLL. This finding suggests that 
risk estimates for all farming and all NHL 
combined may be uninformative and that 
future studies will need to consider both NHL 
subtype and farming type to identify the 
possible speciﬁc farming exposures that may 
be involved in these associations.
The observed associations for hairdressers 
were stronger for women’s hairdressers than 
for other job titles within this occupational 
category, supporting a hypothesis of hair dye 
or other hair treatments more commonly used 
by women than by men or children as possible 
causes. Associations were present for DLBCL 
and CLL/SLL but were absent for FL. A 
previous pooled analysis of InterLymph studies 
reported associations with personal hair dye use 
for NHL subtypes FL and CLL/SLL (Zhang 
et al. 2008). Exposure from personal hair dye use is, however, not strictly comparable to the 
exposure experienced by hairdressers because 
hairdressers are exposed on a daily basis to a 
range of other compounds such as solvents and 
propellant gases, including dichloromethane 
and chloroﬂuorocarbons.
The observed associations between textile-
related occupations and NHL (DLBCL and 
PTCL) suggest a range of possible exposures 
that can occur in this environment, but the 
implication of multiple specific occupa -
tions within this group, which is involved 
in both fabric making and garment making, 
indicates that associations were not restricted 
to speciﬁc tasks in the textile industry (e.g., 
textile dyeing) but rather may be associated 
with more ubiquitous exposures (Siemiatycki 
et al. 1986).
We found associations with NHL for 
a number of other occupations potentially 
exposed to solvents. Among these occupa -
tions were cleaners, painters (especially 
spray-painters) with potential for exposure 
to solvents in paints and paint strippers, and 
machine tool operators, who may be exposed 
to a range of solvents including aliphatic 
hydrocarbon solvents, aromatic hydrocarbon 
solvents, chlorinated solvents, mineral oils, 
and diesel fuel and exhaust. Metal workers 
would also be exposed to metal dust and 
metal-working ﬂuids. Although our ﬁndings 
of positive associations for these occupations 
may support a role for solvent exposure as a 
risk factor for NHL, other exposures may also 
be responsible.
Some solvent exposure would likely be 
implicated in two other occupational groups 
for which we observed an association with 
NHL: several specific occupations within 
the electrical and electronics–related group 
may also have exposure to electromagnetic 
fields (Mester et  al. 2006), and carpenters 
may be exposed to wood dust, wood preserva -
tives, formaldehyde, and molds in addition 
to solvents. Forestry workers could also be 
exposed to wood dust and potentially to 
pesticides and engine exhausts.
All teaching occupations combined were 
inversely associated with NHL, a ﬁnding that is 
the opposite of the results of a death certiﬁcate–
based case–control study (Figgs et  al. 1995) 
and a meta-analysis (Baker et  al. 1999). We did 
observe a marked positive association for prepri-
mary education teachers with CLL/SLL, which 
could point towards common childhood infec -
tions as a possible causal factor (Vineis et  al. 
2000). Long-term employment as a medical 
doctor, in which infectious agents may also play 
a role, was associated with FL.
Among the four NHL subtypes, the statis -
tically significant heterogeneity in relative 
risk estimates suggested that “women’s hair -
dressers” were at an increased risk for DLBCL 
and CLL/SLL, but not for FL, which was previously suggested to be associated with 
personal hair dye use (Zhang et  al. 2008; 
Sangrajrang et  al. 2011). Textile workers were 
another occupational group to show hetero ge-
neity across NHL subtypes and were particu -
larly at risk for DLBCL and PTCL. There 
was no signiﬁcant heterogeneity in ORs for 
crop and mixed/unspeciﬁed farming among 
the four subtypes, although DLBCL and 
CLL/SLL appeared to be most strongly asso -
ciated with farming occupations. We note the 
strong association between spray-painters and 
FL as well as the lack of adequate numbers for 
analysis in the other subtypes examined. The 
authors of a recent major analysis of NHL 
subtypes and a broad range of risk factors in 
the InterLymph consortium reported that 
certain occupations were associated with one 
or more subtypes, including spray-painters 
(FL), crop farmers (DLBCL, CLL/SLL), hair -
dressers (DLBCL, CLL/SLL), and medical 
doctors (FL). These analyses were adjusted for 
all other signiﬁcant risk factors (Morton et  al. 
2014) and are consistent with our ﬁndings. 
However, our analysis based on occupational 
titles is not the proper setting in which to 
explore whether socioeconomic confounders 
for which we were unable to control might 
have generated some of our positive ﬁndings; 
such hypotheses need to be specifically 
addressed in dedicated analyses.
Conclusions
This pooled analysis supports a role for textile-, 
hairdressing-, and farming-related exposures in 
the development of NHL. Additional occupa -
tions associated with NHL or NHL subtypes 
include cleaners, painters, printers, and wood 
workers. The results by sex indicate that occu -
pational exposures may play a role in NHL for 
both women and men, but the speciﬁc occupa -
tions involved differ between the sexes. The 
large numbers of participants and the applica -
tion of standard NHL and occupational clas -
siﬁcation systems allowed us to make estimates 
of relative risk by NHL subtype, forming an 
important step towards improving our under -
standing of NHL etiology. The ﬁndings of the 
present study can be further reﬁned at the next 
stage, after speciﬁc exposures are identiﬁed in 
detailed exposure studies.
