Deliverable 8  - A final report incorporating the input from the Focus Group and technical advisors. 
At the inaugural project meeting it was agreed that  economic aspects would not be considered and 
that the project would focus only on the on techni cal aspects of dyeing and dye recovery. It was also 
agreed that the thermal regeneration of carbon by the textile industry would not be technically feasible 
so this aspect would not be considered. 
Background 
The textile industry is characterised by high water consumption and as one of the largest industrial 
producers of wastewaters. Textile effluents from  cotton dyeing represent  severe environmental 
problems as they contain highly coloured and high co nductivity wastewater re sulting from dye baths 
and dye rinse waters, which contain unfixed dyes. R eactive dyes are the major cause for complaint. 
Exhaust reactive dyeing requires high salt  concentrations (up to 80 g/L of Na 2SO 4/NaCl). Reactive dye 
bath and first rinse represent 6 to 30 L effluent per kg  of fabric and most of the colour and salt. The 
main challenges that textile industries face from dy eing of cellulose with reactive dyes is to reduce 
water consumption and high salinity coloured effluents.  
ii 
 The removal of colour from effluent after dyeing of  cellulosic fibres is a major problem due to the 
difficulty in treating such effluents by conventional tr eatment methods. Cellulosic fibres of a specific 
shade (colour) are produced by reacting the fibres with a mixture of reactive dyestuffs, salt and 
auxiliary chemicals. Reactive dye exhaustion to the fibre is about 80%, i. e. 20% remains in the 
effluent; this is hydrolysed dye which cannot be re used for dyeing. The exhausted reactive dye bath 
together with first rinse represents 6 to 30 L effluent/k g of fabric and most of the colour and salt. The 
total water consumption for reactive dyeing ranges from 25 to 100 L effluent/kg fabric while the water 
consumption from total textile finishing ranges from 30 to 150 L effluent/kg fabric. Thus the 
concentration of the dye and salts are 5 time s more concentrated when obtained at source. 
There have been a large number of studies describing the use of activated carbon for the removal of 
colour from textile effluents but these studies ha ve been unsuccessful for a number of reasons: 
 the studies focused on the combined dye hous e or factory effluent. The dye concentrations are 
low, and the volumes are large. This resulted in low driving forces and large carbon inventories. 
 the salt concentrations were low. Dyeing wi th reactive dyes requires a high electrolyte 
concentration (up to 80 g/L) in order to force the dye equilibrium towards the fabric. This will 
improve the driving force of the dye onto the carb on.  Treatment of the dilute dye house effluent 
reduces the salting out effect.  
 modern reactive dyes have bifunctional or more bonding groups and thus have a much higher 
affinity for the fabric, thus there is less residual  dye in the dye effluent, hence the mass of carbon 
required per mass of textiles is reduced. 
The proposed activated carbon process will be close-coupled  to the dye machine and will treat the hot 
dye liquor. The dye will be remo ved and the hot water containing the electrolyte will be recycled 
directly to the dye bath for the subsequent dyeing. 
The most important parameter is the amount of car bon to treat the exhausted dye bath for each type 
of dye chemistry for a fixed shade. The feed conc entration to the activated carbon column is the 
exhausted dye bath from each shade. 
Dye Chemistry 
A literature review ( Chapter 2 ) on the reactive dyes (unique pure molecules) and dyestuffs 
(commercial preparations containing a complex mixt ure of synthesis chemical s, dyes, by-products, 
additives and diluents, etc.) describes the progre ss in commercially available dyestuffs and the 
technical and environmental advantages in using newer classes of dyestuffs. The chapter also 
contains background information on the propertie s, use and theory of activated carbon for the 
treatment of reactive dye bath effluents. 
Dye Selection 
The selection of dyestuffs ( Chapter 3 ) was based on the results from a previous WRC project ( WRC 
project K5/1363: The promotion of biodegradable c hemicals in the textile industry using the score 
system: Phase 1 – pilot study ). Representatives of those dyestuffs that pr oduced low environmental 
impact were selected. The range of shades selected co rresponded to shades that were of interest to 
the fashion industry in South Afri ca in that they were selected from the colour pallet of a local 
commission dyehouse which specialised in the dyei ng of reactive dyes. Four shades (requiring a 
combination of up to three different dyestuffs with  different chemistries) were selected for the 
investigation.

Laboratory Dyeings 
Laboratory dyeings ( Chapter 3 ) were conducted at a local dye house using the industrial equipment 
and procedures which are used to determine the reci pes and conditions necessary for the full-scale 
production. The effluent from the different washi ng, soaping and rinsing stages were analysed to 
determine the colour loads from these stages (Figures 1 to 4). 
Dye exhaustion to the fabric for Navy (trifloropyrim idine chemistry), Black (chemistry not divulged), 
Beige (monochlorotriazine chemistry) and Turquo ise (vinylsulphone) shades was about 79%, 78%, 
81% and 79% respectively. Therefore, 19% up to 22 % of the dye used is discharged in the effluent 
resulting in high colour effluent from reactive dyeing operations.  High dye concentration liquor with all the salt used  was obtained in the dye bath effluent. Treatment of 
dye bath with reverse osmosis would not be possibl e because of the high salt concentrations.  
Moderate dye and low salt concentrations were foun d in the first rinse effluen t. Thus treatment of the 
first rinse effluent with membrane filtration may be possible.

Mass balance estimates (Figure-1) show that the removal of colour for the studied reactive dye 
shades from the exhausted dye bat h is necessary. Water recovery ranging from 14 to 25%, salt 
recovery of about 94 to 97% and energy savings of 17 to 32% could be achieved.

 These results can be used to predict of the amount  of dye and salt remaining in the dye bath effluent 
before adsorption studies are undertaken. 
Carbon Equilibrium Tests 
Batch equilibrium tests ( Chapter 4 ) were undertaken using high temperature equipment developed at 
the South African Sugar M illing Research Institute (Durban) in order to de termine the degree of 
adsorption of different reactive dye chemistries onto powdered activated carbon. The tests were 
undertaken for different temperatures, pH val ues and salt concentrations. The influence of 
temperature at constant recipe pH and salt concen tration for the four different shades on activated 
carbon adsorption was examined. It was observed that: 
 the mass of dye adsorbed increased as the temperature increases. The adsorption capacity 
[(mg dye/g carbon) / (mg dye/L)] from 20 to 100 ˚C ranged from 61.54 to 78.16 for Navy shade; 
55.99 to 72.02 for Black shade; 2.096 to 3.873 fo r Beige shade and 33.13 to 53.18 for Turquoise 
shade.  
 the mass of dye adsorbed incr eased slightly as the pH decreases from pH 11 to 4. The 
adsorption capacity (pH 4 to pH 11) [(mg dye/g carbon) / (mg dye/L)] decreased from 84.83 to 
78.16 for Navy shade; 84.53 to 72.02 for Black shade; 3.950 to 3.873 for Beige shade and 64.79 
to 53.18 for Turquoise shade.  
 the mass of dye adsorbed increa sed as the electrolyte concentration increases. The increase in 
adsorption capacity [(mg dye/g carbon) / (mg dye/ L)] ranged from 61.85 to 98.20 for Navy shade; 
57.94 to 89.04 for Black shade; 3.129 to 5.061 fo r Beige shade and 39.93 to 60.74 for Turquoise 
shade.  
A high amount of dye uptake by powdered activate d carbon was observed at high temperature, high 
electrolyte concentration and low pH values. Thes e conditions favour the use of removing unreacted 
dyes from the exhausted dye bath after neutralisation (which is a necessary step prior to reuse). 
Column Tests 
Laboratory-scale column break-through tests ( Chapter 5 ) were undertaken in order to evaluate the 
kinetics of dye uptake. The criterion for breakthroug h was the amount of residual colour that would be 
just acceptable for reuse using a similar shade to the test shade. 
Adsorptive capacities ranging from 20 to 39 mg dye per gram carbon were observed for 60 ˚C (highest 
temperature for this column study) for all t he shades evaluated. For low temperature (20 ˚C), the 
adsorptive capacity ranged from 2 to 16 mg dye per gram carbon. 
The dye volumes for 95% exhaustion ranged from 81  to 89 bed volumes for high temperature (60 ˚C) 
while for low temperature (20 ˚C) was 85 to 102 bed volumes. 
A decrease in flow rate increases the adsorption ca pacity of the column. The carbon capacity at low 
flow rate ranged from 20 to 37 mg dye per gram ca rbon while at high flow rate ranged from 15 to 
20 mg dye per gram carbon. 
Regeneration 
The carbon was regenerated using 1 M NaOH as the eluent ( Chapter 6 ). The influent was allowed to 
percolate through the saturated carbon bed of 70.6 mL at a flow rate of 0.625 mL/min. From these 
results it was assumed that 3 bed volumes of 1 M Na OH would be sufficient. At least three cycles of 
regeneration were carried out within the standard limit  for reuse. Significant deterioration of the carbon  
vi 
 was observed at the fourth cycle. A small decline in GAC adsorption capacity was observed from the 
first to the third regener ation cycles. The role of dye auxiliari es on the activated carbon were not 
evaluated in the study and it is possi ble that they could have major e ffects that are detrimental on the 
performance of activated carbon. 
The effectiveness of chemical regeneration of satu rated carbon using NaOH was not satisfactory in 
terms of industrial application because of the number  of cycles achieved. The results obtained showed 
that the use NaOH compared to other chemical  regenerants need to be investigated for the 
implementation of activated carbon for removal of reactive dyes. 
Conclusions 
In this study four different dye classes were inve stigated (Drimarene HF, Cibacron S, Procion HE and 
Remazol Levafix using four standard shades (Nav y, Black, Beige and Turquoise). The reactive 
dyestuffs contained different functional groups (chemi stries). Reactive dye exhaustion to the fibre for 
the four reactive dye classes was about 80%, i.e. 20% remains in the effluent. Reactive dyeing of the 
four studied shades resulted in salt concentration s over 90% and hot coloured water remaining in the 
dye bath effluent. The efficiency of the dyeing proces s for a specific shade is associated with various 
parameters such as substantivity and diffusion rate of  dyes, hardness of water, pH and temperature of 
the dye liquor, type and concentration  of reactive dye used. The use of granular activated carbon for 
the adsorption of reactive dyes has been exam ined and results obtained indicated that activated 
carbon could effectively remove colour from exhaust ed reactive dye bath effluent and allow re-use of 
hot decolourised water with high concentration of salt. From the adsorption results obtained using activated carbon, it was concluded that the most important 
factor influencing the adsorption rate and capacity for the reactive dye shades studied is the 
adsorption temperature. Textile processes require ho t water for reactive dyeing of cotton. There is 
great potential in the textile industry for hot water recovery. The use of heat exchangers to transfer 
heat to the incoming dyeing feed water can be eliminated when using granular activated carbon 
columns. The pH values and electrolyte concentration also played a vital role in the whole adsorption 
process and particularly in adsorption capacity. Colo ur removal of 100%, salt recovery of 94 to 97% 
and energy savings 17 to 32% in the dye bath efflu ent were achieved. Reactive dyeing of cotton is 
performed at high temperatures and in this  study the results were discussed based on 60 ˚C, which 
was the common temperature used for dyeing for all four shades selected. 
The colour breakthrough from column breakthrough curves for 60 ˚C occurred at 14, 21, 45 and 24 bed 
volumes for Navy, Black, Beige and Turquoise shades respectively. The exhaustion or saturation 
volumes for the granular activated carbon were at 24, 41, 45 and 35 bed volumes for Navy, Black, Beige and Turquoise shades respectively. The variati on in the slope of the breakthrough curve may be 
explained on the basis of mass transfer fundament als of adsorption capacity of granular activated 
carbon. Increase in flowrate caused an increase in  zone speed, resulting in decrease in the volume 
required to achieve breakthrough, while a decrease in flowrate resulted in an increased breakthrough 
volume. This was due to decreased contact time between the dye and carbon at higher flow rates.  
From the column test results shown, the values of carbon capacity per kilogram  of fabric obtained from 
the column test were mu ch lower than those of the adsorptio n equilibrium test. The reason is that 
more of the adsorption sites are ex posed in powdered activated carbon than in the granular activated 
carbon. The Freundlich isotherms measured in the adsorption equilibrium experiments do not apply to 
the column tests, perhaps due to that the equilibri um is not reached in co lumn tests. One of the 
advantages of using granular activated carbon in th e column test is the possibility of regeneration. 
From studies presented in the liter ature; it was shown t hat the required water quality for textile process  
vii 
 is not stated. The textile industries are using drin king water quality for dyeing, therefore the 75 ADMI 
could be used as the standard limit when treating wate r for reactive dyeing reuse. Dyeing of the same 
shades or dyeing of a darker shade with treated light shade effluent would not need drinking water 
quality. 
The regenerated carbon for this study was found to be  effective up to 3 cycles of operation within the 
acceptable limit for reuse. Significant deterioration of  the carbon was observed at the fourth cycle. The 
poor performance could be associated with role of  dye auxiliaries in the ov erall adsorption process 
because of their unknown compos ition and chemistry (this was not divulged by the manufacturer for 
confidentiality). This led to the activated carbon not  economically feasible for industrial application. 
Fewer bed volumes were treated when using regenerated carbon compared to virgin carbon. The 
possibility of savings exists when using regener ated GAC for treatment. Regeneration should also 
ensure that the eluted solution is not posing any disposal problems in terms of high acidity and high 
colour concentration. A further investigation of thermal regeneration of the spent granular activated 
carbon for the removal of reactive dyes is n eeded to determine its advantages and disadvantages 
over chemical regeneration. The design, operation and maintenance of carbon adsorption and 
regeneration processes depend on costs and characte ristics of textile water to be treated and the 
capacity of the plant. Therefore the designer is resp onsible for selecting a system that will meet the 
discharge permit requirements at the lowest cost possible. Once the optimum flowrate, bed depth and operating capacity of granular activated is determin ed, the carbon contactors configurations can be 
estimated. The use of rapid small-scale column test  method for designing in this study has the major 
potential advantage over other methods in predi cting the performance of pilot-scale.  
Recommendations 
Further research in this area should concentrate on evaluating different activated carbons and role of 
auxiliaries in activated carbon adsorption studies. When implementing the laboratory-scale plant in 
textile industry, the effect change in temperatur e, pH and electrolyte concentration should be noted 
and the chemical parameters should also be researc hed. The first rinse stream has a moderate colour 
with low salt concentration effluent. If further colour  removal is required, this stream could be treated 
by reverse osmosis. The permeate can be used for the first rinse and the concentrate can join dye 
bath effluent. The further investigation should also  be expanded to the evaluat ion of other chemical 
regenerants and thermal regeneration of saturated activated carbon. The use of granular activated 
carbon adsorption and the regeneration of granular activated carbon should also be taken into account 
for water, salt and energy savings for the textile i ndustry. This study proved that the activated carbon 
adsorption technique is the solution in reactive dyei ng textile industries because of the possibility for 
re-use of water, salt and energy; thus enabling environmental improvements with savings in salt, energy and water.

 1 INTRODUCTION 
Water resources management has become an im portant operational and environmental issue 
especially in the context of South Africa as wa ter is becoming incrementally scarce. Even though it 
appears to be in plentiful supply on the earth’s surf ace, water is a rare and precious commodity, and 
only an infinitesimal part of the earth’s water rese rves (approx. 0.03%) consti tutes the water resource, 
which is available for human activities (Allegre et al.,  2004). South Africa is a semi-arid country. It is 
predicted that in future, increa sing demands will be made on our dwindling water resources. It is 
therefore imperative that all water use sectors use water optimally and efficiently to ensure that the 
needs of both the environment and people are satisfie d for now and future generations (DWAF, 1998). 
Due to the limited water resources in South Africa, it  is important to encourage industries to implement 
water and effluent management strategies and redu ce waste at source (Barclay and Buckley, 2002).  
Increasingly stringent environmental legislation and generally enhanced intensity, efficiency and 
diversity of treatment technologies have made the re use of water more viable in many industrial 
processes. Wastewater reclamation and reuse ar e effective tools for sustainable industrial 
development programmes. The use and re-use of i ndustrial wastewater is a common activity 
throughout the industrial sector in South Africa toda y.  The reality is that discharge of wastewater 
through the municipal sewer system is costly to industries, which must pay the relevant municipal 
authority to receive and treat this wastewater. Alte rnatively, for industries who wish to discharge 
directly into water resource they are required to tr eat the wastewater to acce ptable standards in terms 
of the water use authorisation issued. The treatment  costs of crude water s upplies, and wastewater 
disposal have increased the economic incentive fo r implementing water reuse and recycle processes 
in industry (Dvarioneine et al., 2003). Thus the way industries think about and use water is an important factor in determining the country’s future. 
1.1 Textile Industry 
The textile industry is characterised by high water consumption and as one of the largest industrial 
producers of wastewaters. Textile effluents from  cotton dyeing represent  severe environmental 
problems as they contain highly coloured and high co nductivity wastewater re sulting from dye baths 
and dye rinse waters, which contain unfixed dyes (F aria et al., 2004). Reactive dyes are the major 
cause for complaint. Exhaust reactive dyeing requir es high salt concentrations (up to 80 g/L of 
Na2SO 4/NaCl). Reactive dye bath and first rinse represent 6 to 30 L effluent per kg of fabric and most 
of the colour and salt. The main challenges that text ile industries face from dyeing of cellulose with 
reactive dyes is to reduce water consumption and high salinity coloured effluents. Error! Reference 
source not found.  is a schematic representation of the main  stages involved in the reactive dyeing of 
cotton. This section will describe the three different stages us ed in the colouration of  fabric by reactive 
dyeing namely: preparation, dyeing and finishing. 
The cotton contains a significant am ount of contamination resulting fr om fertilizers, insecticides and 
fungicides. Preparation removes all the natural impurities from the cotton and chemical residues from 
previous processing. Natural impurities include waxe s, oils, proteins, mineral matter, and residual 
seeds. All the impurities on the cotton must be remo ved before dyeing because they can interfere with 
dyeing process resulting in uneven dyeing, spotti ng and permanently damaging the cotton fibre. The 
processes involved in preparation are desizing,  scouring and bleaching. The second stage in 
colouration of cotton is dyeing. Different reactive  dye classes require specific dyeing procedures; 
however a common factor is that high volumes of water, auxiliaries , salt and alkali are required to 
produce a dyed cotton fabric. The total volume of water from the dyeing process is determined by a  
2 
 liquor ratio, which is the volume of dye solution required to dye a mass of fabric. The liquor ratio 
ranges from 30:1 L effluent/kg fabric in old equipm ent or short runs to 3:1 in ultramodern airflow 
equipment. A typical value for the liquor ratio is 10:1. Subsequent rinsing of the reactive dyed cotton fabric gives rise to large volumes of coloured effluent with high salts. The third stage is finishing, which improves the quality of the cotton fabric after dyeing (Hendrickx and Boardman, 1995). The water 
consumption resulting from the dyeing process from reactive dyeing ranges from 75 to 150 L effluent 
per kg of fabric.

1.2 Textile Wastewater Treatment 
The rapid development of textile industries has given rise to multiple environmental problems which 
led to the development of cleaner technologies a nd waste minimisation te chniques. Sustainability 
assessment is the approach to evaluate the clean er technologies and waste minimisation for waste 
discharges. The sustainability of any technology or technique is assessed from three points of view: 
economic, environmental and social impacts. Waste minimisation techniques can be grouped into four 
major categories: inventory management and improved operations, modification of equipment, production process changes, and recycling and reuse (Eckenfelder, 2000; Barclay and Buckley, 
2002). 
The main challenge that textile industries face from dyeing of cellulose with reactive dyes is to reduce 
water consumption and the highly saline coloured e ffluents. Coloured effluent disposed by textile 
industries into Sterkspruit River was observed in the Hammarsdale area of KwaZulu-Natal in the last 
 
3 
 decade. The inadequate treatment of Hammarsdale Wastewater Treatment Works resulted in poor 
quality final effluents, which have an adverse envi ronmental impact on Sterkspruit River. The 
eThekwini municipality is encouraging the textile indu stries to be involved in waste minimisation and 
cleaner production technologies. The removal of co lour from dyeing of cellulose effluent is a major 
problem due to the difficulty in treating such effl uents by conventional treatment methods. Biological 
treatment, chemical precipitation, membrane tec hnology, activated carbon adsorption and evaporation 
are the common wastewater treatment techniques of textile industry effluents (Wenzel et al., 1996). 
Removing colour from reactive dye bath for reus e by conventional processes such as chemical 
precipitation, evaporation and biological treatment have been ineffective because of the high salt 
content resulting from reactive dyeing. This is because only water can be reclaimed and not the salt and energy (Wenzel et al., 1996; Allegre et al., 2004 ). Membrane filtration techniques such as reverse 
osmosis can reclaim water, salt and energy (Dvarion iene et al., 2003) but high concentrations of salt 
used in reactive dyeing will increa se osmotic pressure which reduce s the net pressure driving force 
and permeate flow (Allegre et al., 2004).The salt  and the residual dye still need to be separated. 
Activated carbon adsorption is the one promising tech nique for recovery of water, salt and energy from 
exhausted dye bath. The advantage of us ing this stream is that the hi gh salt concentration could shift 
the dye equilibrium towards the carbon resulting in very high removal efficiencies. It is hypothesised 
that dye removal using activated carbon will be mo re complete in the pres ence of high concentration 
of salt and the decolourised dye solution can be reused preventing the discharge of large masses of 
salts and water. Much work has been done on acti vated carbon for the treatment of combined dye 
effluent; however there has been very little work on the treatment of the reactive dye bath effluent 
using activated carbon. Furthermore the hot saline decolourised dye bath is su itable for direct reuse 
thus reducing the total dissolved solids load from the textile mill and allowing for direct energy reuse. 
Cleaner Textile Production Project funded by Dani da supported Dyefin Textiles and Vivendi Water 
Treatment (equipment suppliers) in the pilot assessm ent of the system. The co st of the system is 
directly related to the capacity of the carbon fo r dyestuffs and the amount of unexhausted dye in the 
effluent. Continuous pilot-scale activated carbon tria ls on exhausted reactive dye bath effluent which 
were undertaken by Vivendi Plant on Dyefin Textile industry effluent conclu ded that Chemviron F-400 
carbon could treat 68 L effluent per kg carbon, i.e. 147 g carbon/kg fabric and the performance of 
thermally regenerated carbon was simi lar to that of virgin carbon (Hoffman, 2004). Further tests were 
needed to quantify the effect of temperature, sa lt and pH on the adsorption characteristics. 
Investigation of new high performance dyes with greater exhaustion is allo wing a trade-off between 
more expensive high performance dyes and the cost of activated carbon. 
1.3 Project Outline 
There are a large number of studies describing the use of activated carbon for the removal of colour 
from textile effluents but these studies have  been unsuccessful for a number of reasons: 
 The studies focused on the combined dye house or factory effluent. The dye concentrations are 
low, and the volumes are large. This resulted in  low driving forces and large carbon inventories 
(Wenzel et al., 1996; Santhy and Selvapathy, 2006). 
 The salt concentrations were low. Dyeing wi th reactive dyes requires a high electrolyte 
concentration (up to 80 g/L) in order to force the dye equilibrium towards the fabric. This will 
improve the driving force of the dye onto the ca rbon Treatment of the dilute dye house effluent 
reduces the salting out effect  (Wenzel et al., 1996) . 
 Modern reactive dyes have bifunctional or more bonding groups and thus have a much higher 
affinity for the fabric, thus there is less resid ual dye in the dye effluent hence the mass of carbon 
required per mass of textiles is  reduced (Allegre et al., 2006).  
4 
  The proposed activated carbon process will be close-coupled  to the dye machine and will treat 
the hot dye liquor. Error! Reference source not found. Figure 1-2 shows an overall sketch of 
activated carbon process close-coupled to the dye machine. The dye will be removed and the 
hot water containing the electrolyt e will be recycled directly to the dye bath for the subsequent 
dyeing. 
The most important parameter is the amount of car bon to treat the exhausted dye bath for each type 
of dye chemistry for a fixed shade. The feed concent ration to the activated carbon column should be 
the exhausted dye bath from each shade.

 The objective of this study is to establish the pr ocess parameters governing the recovery of water and 
chemicals for reuse from reactive dye baths using activated carbon and to investigate a process for 
recovering water and chemicals from reactive dyei ng. The following approach was adopted to achieve 
these aims: 
 The first phase of this project involved researchin g of the relevant literature on reactive dyes and 
activated carbon adsorption. The reactive dye ch emistry and the factors that affect adsorption 
equilibrium were investigated. 
 The experimental work on dyeing a range of shades using different dye chemistries being 
undertaken in terms of WRC Project K5/1363 - The promotion of biodegradable chemicals in the 
textile industry using the score system: phase 1 - pilot study , was of particular relevance to this 
project in selecting dye chemistries and dyes tuffs to be evaluated. The four selected dye 
chemistries represent almost all reactive dye chem istries used in Dyefin textile factory. Four 
reactive dye classes of Drimarene HF, Cibacron S,  Procion HE and Remazol L with different dye  
5 
 chemistries were selected from the WRC Project K5/1363 to produce four different laboratory 
shades. Laboratory dyeing for four different sh ades (Navy, Black, Beige and Turquoise) with 
associated auxiliaries and salts were undertaken fo llowing a specific dye recipe for each of the 
shades. Each shade consisted of up to 3 dyestuffs. The Navy shade was made of three Drimarene HF reactive dyes, Black shade consisted of two Cibacron S reactive dyes, Beige shade made of three Procion HE reactive dyes  and Turquoise shade consisted of two Remazol 
and one Levafix reactive dyes. 
 The dye bath liquor from each of these labora tory dyeings was then tested against activated 
carbon. One grade of F-400 activated carbon from Chemviron was selected. Adsorption 
isotherm experiments were undertaken on the dye li quor bath. The effect of three different salt 
concentrations, three pH values and four different  temperatures on the adsorption isotherm was 
determined for all four shades. Column tests were undertaken using the exhausted dye bath at 
three different temperatures to determine the ki netics of dye adsorption. The results would be 
used to determine the parameters  for standard adsorption theory. 
 Finally, the carbon was chemically regenerated  at a laboratory scale under a range of conditions. 
Column experiments for the regenerated carbon were performed to determine the performance 
of the regenerated carbon. This procedure was re peated for a number of cycles to evaluate the 
regenerated carbon adsorption capacity. The results were used to assess the overall performance of the reuse system. The possible syst em for removal of colour for the reuse of salt, 
water and energy was designed. Table 1-1 sh ows the overall summary of the project.

 2 LITERATURE  REVIEW 
From Chapter 1 , the main objective of this investigati on is to establish the process parameters 
governing the recovery of water and chemicals for reuse from reactive dye baths using activated carbon. The textile industry plays an important role in our economy in increasing consumer interests 
by producing cotton fabric with value, comfort and st yling using reactive dyes. At the same time large 
volumes of water are used for reactive dyeing and large quantities of coloured wastewater with high 
salt contents are generated. Treatment of textile effluent resulting from reactive dyeing is major 
problem facing textile industries today. The failure of  most conventional treatme nt process resulted in 
the need to develop alternative treatment methods such as activated carbon adsorption. Activated 
carbon adsorption has been studied in more detail th an the other treatment methods in this chapter. In 
this chapter the relevant literature on reactive dyes and activated carbon has been reviewed. Section 2.1 discusses an overview of reactive dyes while Section 2.2 discusses the activated carbon 
and its adsorption characteristics. Water quality for reuse and system design for activated carbon treatment is discussed in Sect ion 2.3 and 2.4 respectively. 
2.1 Reactive Dyes - an Overview 
Reactive dyes gained popularity in the 20th century as dyes that give a permanent colouration to 
cellulosic textile substrates, and an important criterion was that the colour did not fade or discolour on laundering. Reactive dyes are dyes which have gr oups capable of forming bonds between a carbon or 
phosphorus atom of the dye ion or molecule and oxy gen, nitrogen or sulphur atom of a hydroxyl, an 
amino or mercapto group respectively of the textile  substrate. This section discusses the development 
of reactive dyes of cotton, their chemistry, chemic al constitution, classes, reactivity, application and 
storage. 
2.1.1 Development of reactive dyes 
The most important distinguishing ch aracteristics of reactive dyes ar e that they form covalent bonds 
with the substrate that is to be coloured during  the application process. Thus, the dye molecule 
contains specific functional groups that can underg o addition or substitution reactions with the OH, SH 
and NH 2 groups present in textile fibres (Hunger, 2003).  
The concept of immobilising a dye molecule by cova lent bond formation with reactive groups in a fibre 
originated in the early 1900s (Broadbent, 2001). Cross and Bevan first succeeded in fixing dyes 
covalently onto cellulose fibres, but their mult i-step process was too complicated for practical 
application. Early work by Schroter with sulfonyl chloride-based dyes was unsuccessful, but Gunther 
later did succeed in fixing derivatives of is atoic anhydride onto cellulose fibres. Haller and 
Heckendorn, and Heyna and Schumacher in the 1940s  also contributed in the approach of modifying 
the fibres and introduced coloration (Hunger, 2003) . In 1955, Rattee and Stephen, working for ICI in 
England, developed a procedure for dyeing cotton with fibre-reactive dyes containing dichlorotriazine 
groups. They established that dyeing cotton with thes e dyes under mild alkaline conditions resulted in 
a reactive chlorine atom on the triazine ring being substituted by an oxygen atom from the cellulose 
hydroxyl group (Broadbent, 2001).  
The discovery of reactive dyes was an event of gr eat technical and commercial importance. Not only 
did this class of dye function by the complete new fixation  method of covalent bonding with the 
substrate, but it also offered the cotton dyer a desi rable blend of properties such as high wet fastness, 
brilliance and variety of hue and versatility of  application (Hunter and Renfrew, 1999).

 2.1.2 Reactive dye chemistry 
A dye is dissolved in the application medium, usually water, at some point during colouration. It will 
also usually exhibit some substantivity for the material being dyed and be absorbed from the aqueous 
solution (Hunger, 2003). The molecular structures of reactive dyes resemble those of acid and simple 
direct cotton dyes, but with an added reactive gr oup. Reactive groups are of two main types: 
 Those reacting with cellulose by nucleophilic substitution of a labile chlorine, fluorine, methyl 
sulphone or nicotinyl leaving group activated by an adjacent nitrogen atom in a hetero-cyclic ring 
(Broadbent, 2001). The reaction is called hetero- aromatic nucleophilic substitution (Hunter and 
Renfrew, 1999). 
 Those reacting with cellulose by nucleophilic addition to a carbon-carbon double bond, usually 
activated by an adjacent electron-attracting su lphone group (Broadbent, 2001). Overwhelmingly, 
sulphonyl has emerged as the preferred activating group with α-halo-amido group playing a 
minor role. While vinyl sulphones are applied to all cellulosic and protein fibres, the α-
haloacrylamido types are largely confined to the latter, especially wool (Hunter and Renfrew, 
1999). 
The dyes can also react with water and these reac tions compete with one another. The reactive group 
must exhibit adequate reactivity towards cotton, but  have lower reactivity towards water molecules 
which can deactivate the dye by hydrolysis. The hydrolys is of the reactive group of the dye is similar to 
its reaction with cellulose but involves a hydroxyl ion in water rather than a cellulosate ion in the fibre 
(Broadbent, 2001). All dyes are hydr olysed, the extent of which deter mines the efficiency of dyeing, 
and as a result 100% efficiency (or fixation) is ne ver achieved. Commercial reactive dyes vary in 
molecular mass and complexity in that they c ontain one, two and/or three chromophoric units and up 
to three different reactive groups, whic h will be discussed in subsequent sections. 
Chemical constitution of reactive dyes  
In a dye molecule, a chromophore is combined with one or more functional groups, the so called 
anchors that can react with cotton. Under suitable conditions, covalent bonds are formed between dye 
and cotton fibre (Hunger, 2003). Reactive groups in crease the molecular mass of a dye but do not 
enhance chromogenic strength (Hunter and Renfrew, 1999). 
Monofunctional  
Most mono-anchor dyes are derivatives of cyanuric ch loride (2,4,6-trichloro-1,3,5-triazine), a molecule 
of wide synthetic potential because the three chlorine atoms on the triazine ring differ in their reactivity. 
The first chlorine atom exchanges with nucleophiles in water at 0 to 5°C, the second at 35 to 40°C and 
the third at 80 to 85 C (Hunger, 2003). 
Bifunctional dyes 
The concept of reactive dyes with two reactive groups was well established in the early years of 
reactive dyeing but at that time fi xation efficiency was not a major iss ue and bifunctional dyes were the 
exception rather than the rule until textile i ndustries observed that more that 50% of the 
monofunctional dyes could be lost to hydrolysis  and discarded in the dye effluent (Hunter and 
Renfrew, 1999).  Since the 1980s considerable interest has been shown in strongly fixing reactive dyes, and the required high fixation values have increasingly been achieved with the aid of double anchors (Hunger, 2003). 
Double-anchor dyes can be divided into two categories: those containing two equivalent reactive 
groups called homo-bifunctional dyes (e.g. bis- β-sulphatoethylsulphone (CI Reactive Black 5)) and  
9 
 those with mixed-anchor systems called hetero-bifu nctional dyes (e.g. CI Reactive Red 194). A homo-
bifunctional reactive dye encompasses products cont aining two vinylsulfonyls or sulfoxyethylsulfonyl 
group, which increase  the probability of reaction with the fibre.  Introduction of homo -bifunctionality into 
cellulose reactive dyes is achieved by di fferent molecular structures: mono azo bis-
monochlorotriazinyl, dis azo bis-monochlorotriaziny l, non-azo-bis-monochlorotr iazinyl, Procion H-EXL 
and bis-vinylsulphonyl reactive dyes (Hu nger, 2003; Hunter and Renfrew, 1999). 
In a mixed-anchor system the two reactive groups have different reactivities: a more reactive 2-
sulfohydroxyethysulfonyl group and a less reacti ve monochlorotriazinyl residue (Hunger, 2003). 
Hetero-bifunctional reactive dyes , which have diffe rent optimal fixation towards cotton gives a more 
uniform degree of fixation over a wide range of dy eing temperature and fixation pH values than homo-
bifunctional reactive dyes (Broadbent, 2001). 
Multifunctional dyes 
The introduction of more than two anchor group s has only a minor influence on dye fixation 
characteristics, so multiple-anchor dyes play only a subordinate role in world markets (Hunger, 2003), 
increasingly this has been an area of patent intere st (Hunter and Renfrew, 1999). A number of tri-
functional dyes containing bis-vinyl sulphone/monochlorotriazine and bis-vinyl sulphone/monofluorotriazine reactive groups have been disclosed by dye suppliers (e.g. Ciba, etc.). 
Four (tetra-functional dyes) and five (penta-functi onal dyes) independent reac tive groups have been 
developed (Hunter and Renfrew, 1999). 
2.1.3 Reactive dye classes 
Virtually every conceivable chro mophore has been used in the synthesis of reactive dyes.  
Azo dyes  
Most reactive dyes fall in the category of azo dy es. Virtually every hue in the dye spectrum can be 
achieved by appropriate structural modifications (mono- and di-azo dyes, combinations involving 
either single or multiple aromatic and hete rocyclic ring systems) (Hunger, 2003).  
Metal-Complex (formazan) dyes  
Exceptionally lightfast colours are obtained with metal-complexed azo dyes. Copper complexes of 
disubstituted azo compounds produce a wide range of co lours (yellow, ruby, violet, blue, brown, olive, 
black) (Hunger, 2003).  
Anthraquinone dyes  
Anthraquinone-based dyes are si gnificant because of their br illiance, good light fastness and 
chromophore stability under both acidic and basic conditions. Recently, in the 21st century, they 
dominated the market for brilliant blue reactive dyes in spite of their relatively low colour strength and 
comparatively high cost. The shades of commercial reactive anthraquinone dyes range from violet to blue, e.g. C.I. Reactive Blue 19 (Hunger, 2003).  
Triphenodiaxazine dyes  
Dyes derived from triphenodioxaz ine ring system have been commer cially available since 1928 when 
Kranzlein and co-workers discover ed dyes with this basic structure augmented by sulfonic acid 
groups. The triphenodioxazine chromophore was test ed in almost every class of dyes, but only 
recently has it been introduced into reactive dyes. Until the 21st century, anthraquinone dyes were  
10 
 predominant in most applications requiring brilliant blue dyes, but the much stronger triphenodioxazine 
dyes now represent a less expensive choice  in many applications (Hunger, 2003).  
Phthalocyanine dyes  
The water-soluble reactive phthal ocyanine dyes yield brilliant turquoise and gr een shades not 
available in any other dye category. The most impor tant reactive phthalocyanine dyes contain copper 
or nickel as their central atom; they are substituted with sulfonic acid groups and also with reactive groups joined via sulphonamide bridges, e.g. C.I. Reactive Blue  15 (Hunger, 2003).  
2.1.4 Reactive dye reactivity 
The reactive groups of various types of reactive dye have different chemical  structures and show a 
wide range of reactivity. Reactive dyes r eactivity is classified into the following: 
 Alkali-controllable dyes, which have high reacti vity and only moderate substantivity. They are 
applied at low temperatures and level dyeing require s careful control of the addition of alkali to 
initiate the fixation stage, e.g. dichlorotriazine, difluorochloropyrimidine and vinylsulphone reactive dyes. 
 Salt-controllable dyes. These dyes have low reactivity towards cellulose under alkaline 
conditions and therefore the dyeing temperature will be as high as 80 C. They have appreciable 
substantivity and level dyeing requires careful additi on of electrolyte to promote exhaustion, e.g. 
trichloropyrimidine, monochlorotriazine and monofluorotriazine reactive dyes. 
 Temperature-controllable dyes, which undergo fi xation at high temperatures even under neutral 
conditions, e.g. nicotinyltriazine (Broadbent, 2001). 
2.1.5 Basic principle of dyeing cotton with reactive dyes 
The relatively simple procedure for batch dyeing of  cotton materials with reactive dyes, developed by 
Rattee and Stephen (Broadbent, 2001), is still used for a ll types of reactive dyes irrespective of their 
particular reactive group. Dyeing is commenced in neut ral solution, in the presence of electrolyte to 
promote exhaustion of the dye ont o the cotton.  During this period,  the dye does not react with the 
fibre and migration from fibre to fibre is possible. An appropriate alkali is added gradually to the dye bath to increase the pH, this initiates the desired dye-fibre reaction. The hydroxyl groups in cellulose 
are weakly acidic and absorption of hydroxide ions causes some dissociation, forming cellulosate ions, 
which react with the dye by nucleophilic addition or su bstitution. In general, the lower the reactivity of 
the reactive group of the dye towards alkaline ce llulose, the higher the final dyeing temperature and 
the higher the final pH of the dye bath (Broadbent, 2001; Hunger, 2003). After dyeing, any unreacted 
and hydrolysed dye present in the cotton must be re moved by thorough washing to ensure no colour 
bleed from the cotton on subsequent washing during use (Broadbent, 2001). 
2.1.6 Reactive dye application and storage 
Reactive dyes are water soluble anionic electrophiles,  which react to a greater or lesser degree with 
nucleophilic fibres during dyeing. Fixation to cell ulose presents a number  of special problems. 
Application disadvantages of reactive dy eing of cellulose include the following: 
 Hydrolysis accompanies fixation, resu lting in incomplete utilisation of dye 
 Relatively large amounts of electrolyte are required for exhaust and pad steam applications 
 Laborious removal of unreacted and hydrolysed dy e is required- often a longer operation than 
the dyeing step itself and not al ways entirely satisfactory 
 Hydrolysed dye is discharged as coloured effluent  
11 
  Colour is not easily removed by effluent treat ment processes and in many cases the dyes are 
not readily biodegradable 
 Unhydrolysed, unfixed haloheterocyclic reacti ve dyes may pose an environmental hazard 
(Hunter and Renfrew, 1999). 
Because most reactive dyes are prone to hydrolysis , their handling and use requires care. Once a dye 
is prepared, it cannot be stored for later use without some risk of hydrol ysis of the reactive group. This 
decreases its fixation ability and is a particular proble m with the most reactive types of dye. Many 
commercial reactive dyes are dusty powders but all physical forms must be handled with care. These 
dyes react with the amino groups in proteins in the skin and on mucous surfaces. Inhalation of the 
dust is dangerous and a dust mask is obligatory du ring handling. Reactive dye powders and grains are 
sometimes hygroscopic and drums must be carefully re-sealed. Most reactive dyes have a limited storage period, after which some deterioration can be expected (Broadbent, 2001). 
2.1.7 Colour measurement 
The colour from dyeing can be expressed on a sc ale developed by the Amer ican Dye Manufacturers 
Institute (ADMI). This scale uses a spectral or a tr istimulus method to calculate a single colour value 
that is independent of hue (dominant wavelength). Therefore if two colours, A and B, are judged 
visually to differ from colourless to the same degree, their ADMI co lour values will be the same (Allen 
et al., 1973; Greenberg et al., 1995). It is a very sensitive scale. For example the ADMI value for tap water is ~75. 
2.1.8 Treatment of reactive dyeing effluent 
 The importance of colour and salinity pollution co ntrol has been significantly increased since the 
introduction of reactive dyes. Environmentalists ar e concerned with the presence of colour from 
reactive dyeing due to their incomplete exhaustion a nd high salt concentration used in reactive dyeing. 
Failure of conventional treatment processes for remova l of colour from reactive dye baths with high 
salt content resulted in alternative treatment pr ocesses. Among all treatment processes for textile 
wastewater, activated carbon adsorption seems to be promising in the removal of reactive dyes from 
reactive dye bath effluent with high salt content and is explained in more detail in section 2.2. In the 
subsequent sections the failure of co mmon conventional processes is explained. 
Biological treatment  
Biological treatments reproduce artificially or otherw ise, the phenomena of self- purification that exists 
in nature. As a result of the lo w biodegradability of most of the dyes  and chemicals used in the textile 
industry, their biological treatment by activated sludge does not always  meet with great success: in 
fact most of these dyes resist aerobic biologic al treatment. Coagulation-flocculation treatment is 
generally used to eliminate organic substances. Th e products normally used have no effect on the 
elimination of soluble dyestuffs, even though this process is widely used in some countries. It makes it possible to effectively eliminate in soluble dyes (Allegre et al., 2004). 
Evaporation  
Evaporation is technically feasible when the water contains highly water-soluble compounds with low 
vapour pressure. High salinity of the dye-bath has been a limiting fact or in evaporation for the test 
equipment, due to the increase of boiling point and t he capacity of the vacuum pump. However, costs 
for evaporation are much higher than for membrane filtration. For the dye-bath treatment, evaporation 
does not allow the salt content to be re-used, as the activated carbon adsorption does, thus making  
12 
 evaporation economically unfavourable. The evapor ation technique reclaims water and leaves a 
residue of salt, dye-stuffs and chemical oxygen demand together (Wenzel et al., 1996). 
Chemical precipitation  
Removal of reactive dyes by precip itation with various precipitants ha s been shown to be possible by 
other researchers. Precipitati on has been found to leave a certai n amount of impurities from 
precipitants and dyestuffs and in some case surplus precipitants, in the water phase. This increased 
the need for fresh water renewal in case of re-circulation, or activates the need for a secondary treatment such as activated carbon (Wenzel et al., 1996). 
Membrane technology  
The use of membrane filters in the textile indus try was one of the most promising technologies 
available for the purification of process water for reuse but high salt concentrations resulting from 
reactive dyeing have limited its use. Membrane te chnology has emerged as a reliable and applicable 
technology in the treatment of various industrial proc ess effluent streams with low salt concentrations 
(Dvarioniene et al., 2003). Care is needed when using membranes to avoid membrane clogging or fouling, which appears to occur rapidly (Marmagne  and Coste, 1996). The problem associated with 
using membranes is that the higher the concentratio n of salt, the more import ant the osmotic pressure 
becomes and; therefore the greater t he energy required (Allegre et al., 2004). 
2.2 Activated Carbon 
Removal of colour from reactive dye bearing wast ewaters is one of the major environmental problems 
because of difficulty in treating su ch wastewaters by conventional tr eatment methods, as most of the 
reactive dyes are resistant to biological degradatio n and oxidizing agents. This section discusses the 
activated carbon adsorption as a remedial technique,  which offers great potential for the removal of 
colour from reactive dye wastewaters and producing quality effluent. The type of carbon tests (equilibrium, column and regeneration) that will be evaluated for this study will be briefly explained in 
this section with their advantage s and disadvantages. The adsorption experiments are detailed in 
Chapter 4  for equilibrium, Chapter 5  for column and Chapter 6  for regeneration. 
2.2.1 Background 
Water insoluble dyes (e.g. disperse and vat dyes) generally exhibit good exhaus tion properties, i.e. 
most of the dyes bonds to the fibre and have been re ported to be removed by physical means such as 
flocculation (Shaul et al., 1986; 1988). Since the intr oduction of water soluble (reactive dyes), which 
are used extensively by the textile industries, conventional biological treatment processes are no 
longer able to achieve adequate colour removal. The use of adsorption as an alternative technique for 
removal reactive dyes is as a result of the failure of conventional physicochemical coagulation/flocculation methods (Juang et al., 1996). 
Adsorption on porous carbon was described as earl y as 1550 BC in an ancient Egyptian papyrus and 
later by Hippocrates and Pliny the Elder, as an adsorbent for medicinal purposes (Bansal et al., 1988; Allen et al., 1998). In the 19
th century, powdered carbons made fr om blood, wood and animals were 
used for the purification of liquids.  At the beginning of the 20th century, the use of bone char available 
as granular material was used for decolourisation in the sugar industry, where the liquid to be treated 
was continuously passed through a column (Has sler, 1974). Currently, activated carbons are 
produced commercially from precursor materials such as coconut shells, coal, peat, nutshells, wood 
and lignite by either chemical or physical activation or a combination of both of these methods (Bansal 
et al., 1988).   
13 
 Activated carbons are unique and versatile adsorb ents because of their extended surface area, 
microporous structure (Allen and Koumanova, 2005), high adsorption capacity, and high degree of 
surface reactivity. They are extensively used to  purify, decolourise, deodorise, dechlorinate, and 
detoxify potable waters; for solvent recovery and air purification in inhabited spaces such as 
restaurants, food processing and chemical indust ries. According to Bansal et al.(1988), the 
characterisation of activated carbon is carried out  on the basis of several physical and chemical 
properties, commonly including their to tal surface, pore  size distribution, impact  hardness and ability to 
adsorb selected substances. 
During the 20th century, the first processes were developed to produce activated carbons with defined 
properties on an industrial scale. The use of acti vated carbons in an adsorption process is increasing 
towards recycling and waste minimisation, ther eby reducing the use of the water resources. 
2.2.2 Characterisation of activated carbon 
The effectiveness of activated carbon as an adsorbent  is attributed to its unique properties. A given 
type or sample of activated carbon is usually quant ified based on four primary criteria: total carbon 
surface area, carbon density, parti cle size distribution and adsorptive  capacity. Of course, all these 
factors influence the adsorption rate and capacity. 
Total carbon surface area and carbon density  
Total surface area is measured by the adsorption of nitrogen gas onto carbon and is expressed in 
area per mass of carbon. Because the gas molecule s used to measure adsorption are small, it should 
be noted that this measurement of surface area may be misleading when considering the adsorptive 
capacity of a carbon for large org anic macromolecules (Ford, 1981; Pa trick, 1995). Typical samples of 
activated carbon possess a high surface area in the range from 500 to 1 400 m2/g (Hassler, 1974) and 
a well defined microporous structure (average pore  opening is about 1.5 nm) (Streat et al., 1995). 
Particle size distribution  
Particle size distribution is important in carbon sy stems as it influences the handling of the activated 
carbon material. For example, in granular activa ted carbon (GAC), the particle size affects the 
hydraulic loading, backwash rates for a filter and adsorption rates (Patrick, 1995). The particle size 
distribution of GAC is best obtained by sieve analys is, whereas for the analysis of powdered activated 
carbon (PAC) a Coulter Counter is a suitable device (Zolfl et al., 2000) 
Adsorptive capacity  
Adsorptive capacity is characterised by the effect iveness of activated carbon in removing a given 
contaminant. For example, the commonly used iodine number  describes the capacity of carbon to 
adsorb low-molecular mass substances, while molasses number characterises a capacity of carbon 
for more complex compounds (Patrick, 1995) and methylene blue numbers  represent the amount of 
large micropores and mesopores in the activated carbon (Clements, 2002). 
2.2.3 Adsorption on activated carbon 
Each activated carbon has a unique set of physica l and chemical characteri stics that are dependent 
on the type of raw material and the processing met hods (physical, chemical or a combination) 
employed in its manufacture (Allen et al., 1998). Adsorption is defined as a process where the 
adsorbate is attached to the surface of the adsorb ent. The kinetics of adso rption onto the activated 
carbon are controlled by the process of diffusion. The transfer of the impurities from the bulk solution to the internal surface of the carbon proceeds through three stages:  
14 
  Bulk diffusion of the compound from the li quid to the film around the carbon particle  
 Diffusion through this surface film, this is usually the rate determining step  
 Diffusion through the internal structure to t he adsorption sites in the carbon (van Lier, 1989).  
Molecules can bind to the surface by two types of  binding forces namely, physical and chemical 
forces. Physiosorption or physical adsorption is the result of intermolecular van der Waals forces or 
hydrogen bonds of attraction between molecules of the solid and the substance adsorbed. The 
physical adsorption is relatively weak and the adsorbed particles are assumed to be free to move on the surface of the adsorbent. There is no significant  redistribution of electron density in either the 
molecule or at the substrate surface (Kumar et al., 2004). Chemisorption  or activated adsorption is 
associated with the transfer and sharing of electr ons between adsorbate and adsorbent resulting in a 
chemisorptive bond, a chemical bond stronger than  van der Waals forces (Suffet and McGuire, 1981; 
Hunger, 2003). The process is irreversible and on desorption the original substance will often be found to have undergone a chemical change. In genera l, the adsorbability of a compound on activated 
carbon increases with  
 Increasing molecular mass 
 A higher number of functional groups such as double bonds or halogen compounds 
 Increasing polarisability of the molecule. This is  related to electron clouds of the molecule.

2004)

2.2.4 Factors affecting adsorption capacity 
One of the factors that influences adsorption on activa ted carbon is the adsorptive capacity of a given 
amount of carbon for a particular solute. Factors t hat can affect adsorptive capacity are as follows: 
surface area of activated carbon, pore size of car bon, solubility of solute in aqueous solution, pH and 
temperature. 
Branch-chain organics are more easily adsorbe d than straight-chain organi cs, while the type of 
attached functional group affects adsorption.  Double- or triple-carbon bond (unsaturated) organics are  
15 
 adsorbed more easily than single-carbon bond (s aturated) organics. These phenomena are attributed 
to the influence of the molecular structure on the pol arity and/or solubility of the compound of interest. 
The aqueous solubility of a solute is inversely re lated to its adsorption onto carbon. Less soluble 
compounds are adsorbed more easily than more soluble compounds (Pope, 1998).  
The porosity of activated carbon, which is classified  by the size of the diameter of the pores, varies 
from micropores (2 nm), to mesopores (2 to 50 nm), to macropores (greater than 50 nm). During 
treatment, particles of the same size as the por es tend to get stuck and retained by the carbon. 
Volatile organic chemicals, metals, and some no n-polar inorganic chemicals are captured and held 
strongly by the activat ed carbon (Hassler, 1974).  Less polar (or weakly ionized) organics are more 
easily adsorbed than polar (or strongly ionized) organics.   
Adsorption reactions are usually exothermic. High te mperatures would seem to inhibit or slow down 
adsorption but this is not usually found to be a factor  in most systems. An explanation for this may be 
revealed by considering the rate-limiting factor for adsorption. In carbon, adsorption is limited primarily 
by the diffusion of solute onto the carbon particle.  Higher temperatures may impede adsorption at the 
adsorption site, but they significantly speed up the pace of diffusion, offsetting any negative 
temperature effect (Mattson and Harry, 1971). 
2.2.5 Factors affecting adsorption rate 
Adsorption rate is limited by diffusion; variables t hat influence diffusion have a significant effect on 
adsorption rate. High concent ration gradient across t he surface of the carbon pa rticle will increase the 
rate of adsorption, though a high concentration of solute can eventually have a negative effect on 
adsorptive capacity. Larger molecules are generally  more easily adsorbed than smaller molecules. 
However, when pore diffusion governs the adsorption process, the adsorption rate decreases with molecular mass above values specific to each ty pe of carbon and within a given class of organics 
(Parker and Hughes, 1998). 
According to van Lier (1989), the rate of adsorption depends on: 
 The nature and relative concentrations of the substances to be removed. 
 The presence of compounds which are not to be  removed, but interfere with adsorption of a 
compound to be removed.  
 The pH and temperature of the solution containing compounds. 
 The carbon type used. 
2.2.6 Adsorption isotherms 
Adsorption is most generally described in terms of isotherms which show the relationship between the 
adsorbate concentration and the amount of adsorbate  adsorbed at a constant temperature (Osipow, 
1962). An adsorption isotherm gives the concentra tion of a substance adsorbed on a surface in 
relation to its concentration in the surrounding fluid when the system is at equilibrium at a constant 
temperature (Broadbent, 2001). A liquid phase isot herm shows distribution of impurities between 
adsorbed phase and bulk solution at  equilibrium. There are many liqui d phase isotherm for adsorption 
but in these study only two (Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms) will be explained. 
Freundlich isotherm  
Freundlich, a German physical chemist, presented an empirical adsorption isotherm for non-ideal 
sorption on heterogeneous surfaces as well as multilayer sorption. A Freundlich isotherm can be used to determine the effect of solubility on the adsorp tive capacity of activated carbon over a range of  
16 
 different concentrations. Under standard conditions, the adsorptive capacity of activated carbon will 
increase as the concentration incr eases, until the maximum saturation capacity is reached (Kumar et 
al., 2004). 
A Freundlich isotherm is commonly used to describe t he adsorption characteristi cs of activated carbon 
in water and wastewater treatment. The empiri cal derived equation of a Freundlich adsorption 
isotherm for this work is defined as: 
1 XCMn
Fk  
where X/M is the amount of dye adsorbed per gram of carbon (mg dy e/g carbon), C is the residual 
concentration (mg dye/L) and kF and n are Freundlich parameters (Jusoh et al., 2005). 
The adsorption isotherm model can be expressed in the linear form as: 
X1log log logCMFkn⎛⎞ ⎛ ⎞ ⎜⎟ ⎜ ⎟⎝⎠ ⎝ ⎠ 
Plotting log (X/M) against log (C) should give rise to a straight line to indicate the validity of the 
Freundlich model. The n and kF values are obtained from the slope and intercept respectively. The 
constant kF, partition coefficient in equilibrium, is positi vely related to the degree of adsorption or 
adsorption capacity, while constant, n, provides estimation of the intensity or strength of adsorption 
(Albanis et al., 2000). 
Langmuir isotherm  
A theoretical model for monolayer adsorption, which involves the assumption that forces acting in 
adsorption are of a similar kind to those involved in  chemical combination, was proposed by Langmuir 
in the 20th century (Mantell, 1951). The model was origi nally developed to represent chemisorption on 
a set of distinct localized adsorption sites. The basic assumptions on which the model is based are: 
 Molecules are adsorbed at a fixed number of well-defined localised sites 
 Each site can hold one adsorbate molecule 
 All sites are energetically equivalent 
 There is no interaction between molecules adsorbed on neighbouring sites  
The Langmuir model has a limited success in pred icting mixture equilibria (Ruthven, 1984). The 
Langmuir adsorption isotherm is defined as: 
XC
M1  +  Cab
a  
where (X/M) is the amount of dye adsorbed per gr am of carbon (mg dye/g carbon), C is the residual 
concentration and a, b are Langmuir parameters. 
the model can also be expressed as:  
17 
 11 1
X C
Mab b ⎛⎞⎜⎟⎝⎠ 
Plotting 1/(X/M) against 1/C should give rise to a stra ight line for the validation of the model. The a and 
b parameter values are obtained from the slope and intercept respectively. The parameter, a, is a 
constant related to the area occupied by a monolay er of adsorbate reflecting the adsorption capacity 
and b is a direct measure for the intensity of  adsorption process (Al-Sarawy et al., 2005). 
2.2.7 Breakthrough behaviour of activated carbon 
Interstitial mass transfer in fixed beds is import ant for designing many column adsorbers. The mass 
transfer zone (MTZ) is the part of the bed of acti vated carbon where adsorption occurs. It also known 
as the adsorption wave zone, because it moves through the carbon bed as the carbon becomes spent. As long as the flow rate, impurity compos ition and concentration remain constant, the length of 
the MTZ remains fixed as it moves through the carb on bed. During the adsorption cycle in a column, 
the upper section of the bed will be saturated with impurities while the lower section is still free of 
impurity. Between these two extremes lies a zone in which the adsorption is actually occurring. This 
zone is referred to as the MTZ. As the column becomes saturated, this adsorption zone moves downwards through the bed and can be regarded as an adsorption wave front moving through the column. Breakthrough occurs when the leading edge of the MTZ, where impurity concentration is 
lowest, moves beyond the end of the carbon bed column. 
2.2.8 System design 
The two dominant factors that cont rol the breakthrough in GAC columns are the adsorption capacity 
and adsorption kinetics. Pilot columns use the same  reliable predictors of breakthrough behaviour 
used in full-scale columns in terms of both ca pacity and rate of adsorption. The Langmuir or 
Freundlich models are used to fulfil the maximum adsor ption capacity of the ad sorbent for designing. 
The shape of the breakthrough curve may decide the num ber of columns to be used in the system and 
the service time of columns (Jamode et al. 2004). 
However, this approach may require time consuming and expensive studies. Rapid methods to design 
GAC columns from small columns have been developed to reduce study time and cost. Examples of 
methods using small columns are the short fixed b ed, mini-columns, higher pressure mini-columns, 
dynamic mini-column adsorption technique, accelerat ed column tests, small-scale column tests and 
rapid small-scale column tests (RSSCT) (Eckenfel der, 2000). The use of the RSSCT, which does not 
require the use of complicated models, will be briefly explained and was used in this study. 
Rapid small-scale column test  
Rapid small-scale column testing is an inexpensive,  accelerated testing method that can be used to 
determine the adsorptive characteristics for a larg e scale, fixed bed columns using small column 
studies. The primary advantage of using RSSCT over pilot testing is the time savings. Other major 
advantages are cost savings, reduced water require ments and the fact that extensive isotherm and 
kinetic studies are not necessary. Mass transf er models can be used to determine dimensional 
parameters. These parameters are used to ma intain similitude between small and large-scale 
columns. Subsequent to determining similitude, the RSSCT can be scaled up to aid in the design of 
full-scale treatment operation.

 2.2.9 Activated carbon adsorption as a reclamation technique 
Activated carbons are the most im portant commercial adsorbents. T heir high surface area together 
with their surface chemical structur e allows them to be used in a wide variety of industrial applications, 
some of the most important dealing with the environm ent field and particularly with water purification 
and industrial wastewater cleaning (Jankowska et al., 1981; Gonzalez-Serrano et al., 2004). Most 
forms of activated carbon are non-polar in nature; they have the greatest affinity for other non-polar 
substances.  
Powdered activated carbon (PAC) and granular ac tivated carbon (GAC) are the forms of activated 
carbon used in water and wastewater treatment. PA C is added to the actual wastewater stream to 
adsorb contaminants, then removed later from the stream and discarded. PAC was often used in the 
past because of its faster adsorption rate, but disposal costs and handling concerns have made GAC 
a more popular alternative for most applicat ions. GAC is used in water treatment, and then 
regenerated when it becomes less effective due to saturation with chemicals. GAC is also usually 
much easier to handle and transport than PAC (Ford, 1981; Brady and McKay, 1996). 
Benefits of activated carbon treatment (F ord, 1981; Wagner and Jula, 1981) are: 
 Highly effective at removing non-polar organic chemicals from water 
 Applicable to a wide variety of organic compounds 
 Very effective at removing colours from waste streams 
 Effective at removing low levels (ppb range) of metal pollutants 
 Thermal regeneration of the carbon destroys the adsorbed waste solute 
 Very flexible system allows rapid start-up and shut down as needed 
 System can be designed so that it is  portable to be taken to waste sites  
Limitations of activated carbon treatment (Ford, 1981; Wagner and Jula, 1981): 
 Limited to wastes with lo w organic concentrations (<5%) 
 Limited to wastes with very low inorganic concentrations (<1%) 
 Unable to remove highly soluble organics, or those with low molecular weights 
 Systems cannot tolerate suspended solids in the influent stream (due to clogging) 
 High operating costs due to ca rbon costs and system requirements 
 Disposal of contaminated carbon can be problematic if it is not regenerated   
Regeneration of granular activated carbon  
Activated carbons that are used for the removal of  organic compounds from liquid phase systems will 
gradually become saturated, due to the concentr ation of contaminants on  the surface of the 
adsorbent. When this occurs a decision must be made on how to deal with the spent material (Clark and Lykins, 1989). Due to the high manufacturing costs and the recovery of components adsorbed on 
the surface of activated carbon, regeneration is the preferred option. The possibility of regeneration is 
one of the main reasons for the wide-spread use of activated carbon as an adsorbent (Zolfl et al., 2000).  
Regarding the regeneration of activated carbon, a careful distinction between reactivation and 
regeneration is of importance. Volatile components or substances with lower energy can be removed 
fairly easily, whereas non-volatile compounds or substances adsorbed with high energy and so-called irreversible residues resulting from polycondensati on and polymerisation product formation can hardly 
be desorbed. Reactivation restores t he activated carbon to a state where it is virtually identical to the  
19 
 properties of the virgin pre-cursor. Regeneration combines both the adsorptive regeneration and 
reactivation. However, for simplific ation all methods will be referred as  regeneration methods (Zolfl et 
al., 2000). 
 There are three potential regeneration techniques:  chemical, steam and thermal. Both chemical and 
steam are used primarily in industrial systems desi gned to recover the adsorbate (Clark and Lykins, 
1989). 
Thermal regeneration 
The thermal reactivation of activated carbon is usually carried out in a multiple hearth furnace. Thermal regeneration is made up of four stages: dr ying, desorption, pyrolysis and gasification. Drying 
occurs in the entry zone of the furnace as the carbon is heated from ambient temperature to 100 C. 
The thermal desorption followed by  pyrolysis of organic adsorbat e occurs as the temperature 
increases beyond the drying temperature. Gasification occurs between 649 C and 1 038 C (Clark and 
Lykins, 1989). 
The three main parameters influencing the regenera tion success are the temperature gradient within 
the furnace, the retention time and the level of exhau stion of the activated ca rbon. A further increase 
in temperature would lead to an unacceptable an d expensive burn-out of activated carbon which 
causes enlargement of micropores. Further carbon loss (up to 15 percent mass) occurs as a result of 
attrition caused by inevitable remo val of the carbon from the column into the furnace. Another 
disadvantage of thermal regeneration is that the adsorbed compounds, which may be useful, are 
destroyed (Zolfl et al., 2000). Thermal regenerati on is the most widely used regeneration method 
despite its energy demand which result high costs (A lvarez et al., 2004; Ferro-Garcia et al., 1993).  
Activated carbon is a valuable commodity whic h is capable of being recycled using thermal 
reactivation or regeneration techniques. Th is process offers significant advantages: 
 Removal of expensive waste disposal costs. 
 Reduction in operating costs as regenerated material is often less expensive than virgin 
adsorbent. 
 The regeneration of activated carbon makes it the less polluted environmental option (Clark and 
Lykins, 1989). 
Chemical regeneration 
Chemical regeneration is based on the transformati on of the adsorbed components into water soluble 
salts by adding diluted acids or bases. Although this  method is unharmful to the activated carbon, both 
the used chemicals and the desorbed substances need to be reprocessed in order to reduce chemical 
waste and costs (Zolfl et al., 2000). Chemical r egeneration can be carried out by desorption of the 
adsorbates using specific solvents or by decomposi tion using oxidizing chemical agents (Alvarez et 
al., 2004). Desorption can take place by a pH chang e which allow the adsorbate to change their ionic 
nature and thus be released from the carbon surface.  The desorption process needs to be followed by 
a neutralisation and rinsing stages (Santhy and Selvapathy, 2006). 
2.3 Water Quality for Reuse 
The required water quality used for textile processes depends on where it will be reused. The textile industry uses water of drinking quality although some  processes do not require  water of this quality. 
The use of reclaimed water for textile processes has been studied by various researchers and in their studies they proved that the use of  reclaimed water for textile dyeing processes was possible. A study  
20 
 performed by Harker in 1980 showed that there wa s no difference observed between fabric processed 
with drinking water quality and fabric prepared with re claimed water. Another re search study by Inoue 
and co-workers (1977) and Tworec k (1984) showed that there was a slight difference which was 
observed when dyeing a fabric with reclaimed water and these effects were considered significant and 
were fully acceptable to the textile mill investigated.  
For this study the acceptable limit (AL) for reuse were  selected on basis that the textile industries are 
using water of drinking quality for their dyeing proc esses, i.e. the ADMI va lue of 75. When dyeing a 
medium shades such as Turquoise and dark shades such as Navy and Black, reclaimed water need 
not be of drinking water quality. According to st udies mentioned on the prev ious paragraph, dyeing 
using reclaimed water with a very low colour produced acceptab le results to the textile mills. Dyeing of 
light shades such as Beige with reclaimed water from  dark shade effluent has to be of acceptable limit 
(thus 75 ADMI). Table 2.2 shows the summary of t he acceptable limit for reuse with corresponding dye 
removed in percentages and dye concentration used for this study

2.4 System Design 
The design of a GAC pilot-scale involves time-c onsuming and expensive studies. The use of Rapid 
Small Scale Column Test (RSSCT), based on fixed- bed mass transfer models, which does not require 
use of complicated models, was developed by Frick and Cr ittenden et al to solve this problem of time-
consuming and expensive methods. The three primary advantages of using RSSCT for design are: 
 The RSSCT can be conducted in less time that is required for pilot studies. 
 Extensive isotherm or kinetic studies are not requ ired for the performance prediction of the pilot-
scale, unlike predictive mathematical models. 
 A small volume of water is needed for the test (Crittenden et al., 1991). 
2.4.1 Scale-up and similitude 
Scale-up is based on similitude between small and large-scale columns considering equilibrium 
capacity, bed volumes treated, particle densities and solute concentration. Results from RSSCT can be scaled up to predict the performance of full-sc ale treatment systems. Similarity of operation 
between small and large-scale column is assured by properly selecting the particle size, hydraulic loading rate and empty bed contact time (EBCT) for the RSSCT. Perfect similarity is achieved if the 
large and small systems have equal surface diffusivities , isotherm capacities, bulk densities, operating 
temperature and influent concentration. Then, the RSSCT and the full-scale plant will have identical 
breakthrough profiles (Crittenden et al., 1986; Cri ttenden et al., 1991). If the adsorption process is 
controlled by multi- adsorbate com petition, then particular care should be given in estimating the 
following design parameters.  
21 
 GAC particle size:  
Smaller GAC particle sizes increase the rate of adsor ption. But if the particles become very small, 
such as powdered activated carbon (PAC), then t hey could not be used in fixed-bed applications. 
Type of GAC:  
GAC with an appropriate pore size distribution suitable for the remo val of identified target compound 
should be selected. Pore size distribution of GA C can be controlled by the degree of activation and 
choice of base materials (e.g . bitumen, wood, coconut, etc.) 
Empty bed contact time  
The empty bed contact time of the RSSCT is determi ned from intraparticle mass transfer resistances. 
If the void fractions, bulk densities and the capaciti es are identical for the carbons used in RSSCT and 
pilot-scale processes, the proper scaling between the small and large column EBCTs can be determined from the following equation: 
2X
SS S
LL LEBCT d t
EBCT d t⎡⎤  ⎢⎥⎣⎦ 
Where S EBCT  and L EBCT  are the EBCTs, Sd and Ld are GAC particle sizes and St and Lt are 
the corresponding operational times for the small and large columns respectively. The dependence of 
the intraparticle diffusion coefficient on particle size is defined by X. If the intraparticle diffusion 
coefficient do not change with particle size ( 0X ), then the exact similarity between RSSCT and 
pilot-scale effluent profiles can be maintained. If the intraparticle diffusion is assumed to cause most of 
the spreading in the mass transfer zone then the intrapar ticle diffusivity is proportional to particle size 
( 1X ).Columns with larger EBCTs will yield larger spec ific volumes of water treated per unit mass of 
GAC. This is because the ratio of length of active  mass transfer zone to the length of the column 
decreases with increasing column length (Crittenden et al., 1991). 
2.5 Closure 
In this chapter, the relevant literature on reactive  dyes has been reviewed, to highlight the different 
reactive dye chemistries, classes and the basic pr inciple of the reactive dyeing process. Different 
treatment technologies for the remo val of colour from exhausted re active dye bath have also been 
highlighted and the emphasis was on activated ca rbon adsorption. The incapability of the existing 
conventional treatment processes resulted in ac tivated carbon adsorption being the promising 
technology in the removal of colour from exhausted  reactive dye bath. Reactive dyeing of cellulose, 
such as cotton in this case study is performed at  high temperatures, high salt concentration and high 
volumes of water (from dyeing, rinsing, etc.) a nd this results in high colour and high salt 
concentrations in the effluent. This is the main c hallenge that the textile industries are concerned 
about. Reactive dyeing of cotton and the parameters involved in the activated carbon adsorption 
process of reactive dyes will be evaluated in the subsequent chapters. The evaluating parameter such 
as different temperatures, pH values, salt concentra tions in the removal of colour were necessary for 
recovery of water, salt and energy from reactive dye bath.

3 REACTIVE  DYEING 
As described in Chapter 1 , reactive dyes will always have a sign ificant place in textile dyeing because 
of their high colour fastness and the wide spectrum  they possess. In the la st decade the consumption 
of reactive dyes has been 4 to 5 times more than ot her dye groups. Cellulosic fibres such as cotton of 
a specific shade (colour) are produced by reacting the fibres with a mixture of reactive dyestuffs, salt 
and auxiliary chemicals. The reactive dyestuff can c ontain different functional groups (chemistries). 
Reactive dyeing of cotton was undertaken to estimate the amount of dye and salt that remains in the 
effluent before activated carbon studies. Laborat ory reactive dyeing trials for different dye 
chemistries/classes operated at Dyefin Textile fact ory were undertaken. This chapter describe the 
selected dye chemistries and classes (section 3.1) used for this study with their dyeing process and 
recipes presented in sections 3.2 and 3.3.1. The discussion and conc lusion of results are discussed. 
3.1 Reactive Dye Chemistry 
The reactive groups found in reactive dyes increase the molecular weight of a dye but do not enhance 
chromogenic strength. Four different reactive dye shades were used in this study; Navy, Black, Beige and Turquoise shades and were obtained using Drim arene HF, Cibacron S, Procion HE and Remazol 
L dye classes respectively. According to manufacture rs’ specifications (Table 3.1) the Drimarene HF 
(from Clariant) belongs to trifluoropyrimidine reacti ve chemistry, the chemistry for Cibacron S (from 
Ciba) is not divulged, while Procion HE (from Dystar) belongs to monochlorotriazine and Remazol (from Dystar) belongs to vinylsulphone reactive chemistry. Drimarene HF dyes are trifunctional 
reactive dyes with three halogens attached to a pyrimidine ring. Procion HE dyes are bifunctional 
reactive dyes which were launched in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Procion were designed to have substantially increased substant ivity exhaustion and fixation values compared with corresponding 
products carrying one chlorotriazinyl. Remazol L dyes are also bifunctional reactive dyes which were 
established in mid 1980s. The synthesis involves a vi nyl sulphone attached to a triazine ring (Hunter 
and Renfrew, 1999). 
3.2 Principle of  Reactive Dyeing 
The preparation, dyeing and finishing of textile products with reactive dyes consumes large amounts 
of energy, chemicals and water. These wet-processing operations require the use of several chemical 
baths that are often at elevated temperatures to ac hieve the desired characteri stics to the dyed fabric. 
Exhaust reactive dyeing of cotton has three consecutive distinct phases: 
 The initial exhaustion phase – During this stage there is migration of reactive dye to the cotton 
fibre. The amount of dye absorbed by the fibre depends on substantivity. The salt such as 
sodium chloride and sodium sulphate are added to pr omote migration of dye to the fibre. This 
phase is usually performed by gradually increasing  the temperature of the dye bath, this aids in 
the penetration and migration of dye into th e fibre (Broadbent 2001). The increase in 
temperature allows swelling of th e cotton fibre which leads to a hi gher dye uptake (El-Shishtawy 
et al., 2007) 
 The fixation phase – At this stage the pH of the dye bath is increased by adding alkali, which 
causes dissociation of some hydroxyl group in the cotton fibre. This allows nucleophilic cotton  
23 
 ions to react with the dye ions. Dye absorpti on reaction progresses until no further dye can be 
taken by the cotton fibre (i.e. reach equilibrium). 
 The post-dyeing washing – The cotton fibre after dyeing contains unfixed dye as well as 
hydrolysed dye, residual alkali and salt that ar e bonded on the surface of fibre. The latter are 
removed by successive rinsing in cold and warm water. The cold rinse removes most of the electrolyte and the unfixed dyes. The removal of el ectrolyte shifts the dye equilibrium back to the 
aqueous phase and eases removal in the cold ri nse. The hydrolysed dye which is adsorbed on 
the fibres is partially removed by warm rinse and  more completely by hot soaping. Rinsing aims 
at removing hydrolysed and unfixed reactive dyes  from the cotton fibre. Depending on the dye 
recipe of the reactive dye used, neutralisation can follow the cold rinse before warm rinse. 
Sodium  hydroxide is adsorbed within the cotton fibres, a neutralisation step is needed to release 
the residual alkali as a neutral salt. The final la st cold rinse removes the last traces of dye 
(Broadbent, 2001). 
Several auxiliary chemicals are added to the bath  during dyeing processes. These chemicals can be 
divided into two groups: commodity and specialty chemicals and will be disc ussed in the subsequent 
sections. 
3.2.1 Specialty chemicals  
Specialty chemicals are mixtures which have an unknown composition due to proprietary information. The mixtures are often developed to solve problems  specific to the process and to counteract or 
enhance the effects of other chemicals (Hendric kx and Boardman, 1995). Examples of specialty 
chemicals used in this study are Dekol (from BASF  plc), Tebolan (from Dr. Th. Bohme KG, Chem. 
Fabrik GmbH), Avcoson from (Avco Chemicals Ltd) and Subitol. In dyeing of cotton, Dekol is used as 
a dispersing agent and protective colloid, Avcoson is used for minimising primary fibre fibrillation and 
Tebolan to prevent unwanted reduct ion of sensitive dyestuffs. Avcoson, Subitol, Tebolan are used in 
the reactive dyeing dye bath. Dekol solution is used fo r soaping process of the cotton fibre and also in 
the reactive dyeing bath. Specialty chemicals can caus e side effects that are detrimental to the overall 
process (This information was taken from Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS). Their composition and 
chemistries were not divulged by the Manufacturer. 
3.2.2 Commodity chemicals 
Commodity chemicals are mixtures or chemical mixt ures that have known com position. Examples of 
commodity chemicals used in this study are sodium  hydroxide, sodium sulphate, sodium carbonate 
and acetic acid. The presence of hydroxide and sulp hate ions opens the structure of the cotton and 
shifts the equilibrium of dye from the aqueous phase to the solid (fibre) phase thus controls or retards the rate of dyeing. The sodium carbonate (alkali) is necessary for the sufficient exhaustion of the dye 
bath to promote the dye-cotton reaction. The acetic acid  is added to control the acidity of the dye bath. 
3.3 Experimentation 
Four different dye shades were evaluated (Table 3. 1). Each shade consisted of three dyestuffs and 
associated auxiliaries. The dy eing recipes for the four shades are presented in section 3.3.1. The salt 
concentration and pH were measured using Jenway  conductivity meter 4310 and pH meter 3310 by 
Jenway. The colour measurement of the dye solution  presented in section 3.3.2 was performed using 
a Cary UV/Visible Spectrophotometer.

auxiliaries, and the shades dye solution was then subjected to the dyeing procedures outlined in 
Appendix A.  The recipe for each shade is explained in the subsequent sections. Prior to the dyeing 
process, the textile was wetted to facilitate an even  intake of dyestuff and dyeing water. For all the 
shades the exhausted dye bath effluent ( S1) was set aside for later analysis.

 3.5 Discussion 
This section discusses the experimental results in section 3.4 of Chapter 3 , beginning with laboratory 
test dyeings, followed by mass balances for to tal dyeing process of all four selected shades. 
3.5.1 Laboratory test dyeings 
The reactive dyeing of four shades (Figs 3.1 to 3.4)  was performed to estimate the amount of dye that 
remains in the effluent before adsorption tests were conducted. Fig 3.1 to 3.4 shows the reactive dyeing of Navy, Black, Beige and Turquoise shades, about 3 850, 3 912, 945 and 3 464 mg/L of dye concentrations and 70, 80, 60 and 50 g/L salt is used respectively when dyeing a fabric. According to the dye recipes higher salt concentrations were used for Navy and Black Shades than for Beige and Turquoise. This is because lower salt concentration s are required for dyeing light shades and higher 
salt concentrations for darker shades (Shu et al., 2005) .  Different dye chemistries used for this study 
exhibit different fixation ratios. This may be due to th e types of reactive dyes used and their associated 
dye recipes. The efficiency of dyeing process for a specific shade is associated with various 
parameters such as substantivity and diffusion rate of dyes, auxiliaries, hardness of water, pH of the 
dye liquor, type and the concentration of reactive dye used.  
According to results obtained from dye bath, high colour and high salt concentration are recovered for 
all the shades.  Dye concentration recovered for all the shades after dyeing were in the following order 
dye bath > soaping > rinsing and neutralisation steps (Figs 3.5 to 3.8). The main source of residual 
colour in the reactive dye bath is the result of their incomplete exhaustion during the dyeing process 
(Golob et al., 2005). The remainder of most unfixed dye on the surface and inside of the fabric was 
eliminated by soaping using boiling detergent solution . The recovered dye concentration after dyeing 
(includes from dye bath effluent up until final rinse)  ranged from 19% to 22% for the studied shades. 
According to Allegre et al., (2006), the hydrolys ed and unfixed reactive dyes after dyeing represents 
20 to 30% of the reactive dyes applied. This is th e colour that is in the effluent and needs to be 
treated.  
The salt concentration recovered was dye bath > 1
st rinse> other dyeing processes (e.g. soaping, 
neutralisation, final rinse, etc.). A ll the salt used was found in the dye bath with traces of salt measured 
in the first rinse. The salts (NaCl and Na 2SO 4) used gave a better exhaustion of dye migration to 
fabric, the overall fixation ratio of reactive dyes ranged from 78% to 81% for the studied chemistries. 
NaCl and Na 2SO 4 are neutral salts that act as catalysts in the reactive dyeing; the need for alkali is for 
covalent bond fixation between dye and the fabric. From the study results obtained by Ahmed (2005), 
it was shown that both sodium chloride and sodium  sulphate were effective exhaust agents in the 
presence of alkali. 
3.5.2 Total dyeing process mass balance 
Tables 3.2 to 3.5 (page 3-8 to 3-9)  shows the mass balance for the dyeing of the four different shades. 
The effluent composition of the shades ranges from 19% to 22% of the dye with all the salt used for 
dyeing. The dye bath has the most dye of about 36% to 53% of the total colour in the effluent and 
almost all the salt ranging between 94% and 97% for a ll the selected shades. The most energy is used 
in dye bath, soaping and rinsing (depending on the desired shade) stages. The volumes of water used 
are the same for all stages of dyeing. 
3.6 Conclusion 
 Dye exhaustion to the fabric for Navy (triflor opyrimidine chemistry), Black (chemistry not 
divulged), Beige (monochlorotriazine chemistry) and Turquoise (vinylsulphone) shades was  
30 
 about 79%, 78%, 81% and 79% respectively. Therefore 19% up to 22% is discharged in the 
effluent resulting in high colour effluent from reac tive dyeing operations. No significant relation 
was observed between the shade and fibre exhaustion for light as well as dark shades. 
 High dye concentration liquor with all the sa lt used was obtained in the dye bath effluent. 
Treatment of dye bath with activated carbon compared to other treatment technologies is 
necessary because of high colour and high salt effluent. 
 Moderate dye and low salt concentrations were fo und in the first rinse effluent. Thus treatment of 
the first rinse effluent with membrane filtration may be possible.  
 Effluent with high dye concentrations and no salt  were measured in the soaping process and 
traces of dye concentration with no salt were obtained in the neutralisation, second and final 
rinse effluents. 
 Mass balance estimates show that the removal of colour for the studied reactive dye shades 
from the exhausted dye bath is necessary. Water reco very ranging from 14 to 25%, salt recovery 
of about 94 to 97% and energy saving s of 17 to 32% could be achieved. 
These results obtained from this chapter were able to  provide the predictions of the amount of dye and 
salt remaining in the dye bath effluent bef ore adsorption studies were undertaken.

4 CARBON  EQUILIBRIUM  TESTS 
According to reactive dyeing studies performed ( Chapter 3 ) reactive dye effluent consist of an 
average of 20% of the unexhausted dye bath with all the electrolyte. After dy eing, the exhausted dye 
bath contains about 53% of the discharged dye and 97% of the salt. The main aim of this part of the 
investigation was to evaluate the effect of diffe rent temperatures, pH values and electrolyte 
concentrations on the removal of reactive dyes using activated carbon. The possibility of using 
activated carbon for the removal of colour and the e ffect of dye equilibrium on different experimental 
conditions was evaluated. This chapter discusses the carbon equilibrium test for this study, beginning 
with a brief introduction on adsorption models and experimental methods used, followed by experimental details and the discussion of the results obtained, and lastly the conclusion. 
4.1 Introduction 
Equilibrium studies are used to determine the ca pacity of the activated carbon adsorbent. The 
equilibrium relationships between adsorbent and adso rbate are described by adsorption isotherms, 
usually the equilibrium ratio between the quantity ad sorbed and that remaining in solution at a fixed 
temperature. The adsorption equilib rium data can be correlated with  various adsorption isotherm 
models mentioned in the literature ( Chapter 2 ). The equilibrium adsorp tion isotherms are of 
importance in the design of adsorption system ( Chapter 7 ).  
Chapter 2  introduced the two adsorption models for which the experimental data was interpreted; 
Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherms res pectively. The two parameter models, namely 
Freundlich and Langmuir, can be readily linearised and hence the parameter values can be easily obtained. When performing the adsorption process the characteristics of the adsorbent are of 
fundamental importance and characteri stics of the granular activated carbon used for this study are 
explained in Section 4.1.1. 
4.1.1 Characteristics of activated carbon 
The selection of suitable activated carbon is of  fundamental importance when designing a carbon 
treatment plant. The activated carbon can be classifi ed by adsorption capacity and physical properties. 
Table 4.1 lists the F-400 specifications which illustr ate the adsorptive character of the activated carbon 
selected for this study. Some of the important characteristics are explained in the subsequent 
paragraph. 
Iodine number provides an indication of the amount  of micropores in the carbon, i.e. indicate 
adsorption capacity for smaller molecules. Molasses number represents the amount of larger pores in 
the carbon, i.e. indicate adsorption capacity for larger molecules. Methylene blue numbers represent 
the amount of large micropores and mesopores in the activated carbon. Apparent density is the mass 
of carbon per unit volume, which can be packed in  an empty column (Clements, 2002). Discussion 
with the supplier indicated that the Chemviron F- 400 has a high adsorption capacity and would be the 
most appropriate quality and it is readily ava ilable in South Africa. The F-400 has amphoteric 
properties (Allen and Koumanova, 2005), which is an  advantage for the adsorption of dyes which may 
exist in solution as either  anions or as cations.

4.2 Experimentation 
The experimentation design for the carbon equilibri um study is explained in  Section 4.2.1 and the 
procedure followed is discussed in Section 4.2.2. 
4.2.1 Experimental design 
The dye solution is made up under neutral conditions so as to reduce the degree of dye hydrolysis. Alkali, to pH 11, is added just prior to dyeing. Thus if the salt solution is to be reused, it will need to be at a neutral to acidic pH value. Thus three pH conditions were investigated (pH 11; 7 and 4). Under 
certain conditions reactive dyeing can be undertaken at 100 ˚C although for the dyes considered for 
this study, 60 ˚C is more usual. As the proposed system  may cool down to room temperature, 
additional temperatures of 40 ˚C and 20 ˚C were investigated. The recommended salt concentrations 
for the different shades were all different (Navy - 70 g/L; Black – 80 g/L; Beige – 60 g/L; Turquoise – 
50 g/L). Higher salt concentrations would result in greater dye exhaustion hence dye concentrations 
about 30 g/L above and below the recommended values were investigated. A matrix of experimental 
conditions is given in Table 4.2. Each condition wa s evaluated (in duplicate) for 5 different ratios of 
carbon/dye.

4.2.2 Procedure 
A representative sample of the F-400 granular ac tivated carbon was pulverised so that 95% passed 
through a 45 Pm screen. The pulverised sample was oven dried for 3 h at 150 C. A representative 
sample of the unexhausted dye bath soluti on to be tested was prepared (according to Chapter 3 ) in 
order to obtain similar condition to the textile proc ess. Different weights of  the oven dried pulverised 
carbon sample of 1; 2; 3; 4 and 5 g (using a MonoBloc AB204-5 Balance accurate to 0.001 g) were transferred to separate metal flasks ( see Figure 4-1 for metal flasks). Duplicates of each weight of the 
activated carbon were prepared. To each metal fl ask containing oven dried pulverised carbon, 80 mL 
of the unexhausted dye solution was added using a graduated measuring cylinder and the metal flask was clamped on the stirring device ( see Figure 4-2  and Figure 4-3  for the stirrers). A constant 
temperature in the water bath was maintained using a ±1C ˚ temperature controller by Julabo; the 
stirring device was designed to permit immersion of t he lower part of the flask containing the carbon-
solution mixture in the bath (see Figure 4-4 for the st irrers). A series of tests were undertaken at 60 ˚C 
for different time periods and 2 h was found to be a dequate for equilibrium (see Figure 4-5 to Figure 
4-8). The mixture was agitated for 2 h. The same volume of dye solution was added to a container 
without carbon and subjected to the same procedur e in order to obtain a blank reading. After the 2 h 
contact time had elapsed, the content s of the flask were filtered under gravity with No 2 Whatman filter 
paper. The first and the last portions of the filtrate  were discarded and the middle portion was saved 
for analysis. The blank was filtered in the same manner as the other samples. The pH was adjusted to 7.6 by using sulphuric acid (Greenberg et al., 1995) and safety glasses were worn all the time. The 
colour of the effluent was measured using Americ an Dye Manufacturer Institute colour method and 
determined by scanning the sample from 400 nm to 700 nm using a Cary UV/Visible spectrophotometer. The salt concentration and pH were measured using conductivity meter 4310 and pH meter 3310 both by Jenway.

4.4 Discussion 
The adsorption tests were conducted to determine the degree of adsorption of different reactive dye 
chemistries onto powdered activated carbon. Figs 4.5 to 4.9 presents the different time intervals were 
evaluated to determine the time for dye carbon equilibrium to be reached, 2 h to 4 h were found to be adequate (see Appendix B ). Studies on adsorption of reactive dyes performed by Namasivayan and 
co-workers (1998), Ahmad and co-workers (2006) a nd Santhy and Selvapathy ( 2006) showed that 70 
min to 4 h is sufficient to reach dye carbon equilibrium adsorption.   
44 
 From Figure 4-9 to Figure 4-12, the influence of temperature at constant recipe pH and salt 
concentration for the four different shades on ac tivated carbon adsorption was examined and it was 
observed that the mass of dye adsorbed increase d as the temperature increases. The adsorption 
capacity [(mg dye/g carbon)/(mg dye/L)] from 20 to 100 ˚C ranged from 61.54 to 78.16 for Navy shade; 
55.99 to 72.02 for Black shade; 2.096 to 3.873 for Beige shade and 33.13 to 53.18 for Turquoise 
shade This may be due to that the increase in temperature allowed the swelling of the activated 
carbon pores, which led to a higher dye-uptake (Kim, 2004). For 20 ˚C isotherms may not be at 
equilibrium due to slow kine tics of low temperatures. 
Figure 4-13 to Figure 4-16 show the influence of pH at 100 ˚C and recipe salt conc entration of the four 
shades on activated carbon adsorption and it was ob served that the mass of dye adsorbed increased 
slightly as the pH decreases from pH 11 to 4. The adsorption capacity (pH 4 to pH 11) 
[(mg dye/g carbon) / (mg dye/L)] decreased from  84.83 to 78.16 for Navy shade; 84.53 to 72.02 for 
Black shade; 3.950 to 3.873 for Beige shade and 64.79 to 53.18 for Turquoise shade. A possible reason for the dye adsorption behaviour with pH is that at lower pH values, the surface charge of the carbon will be positive thus attracting the negat ively charged functional groups on the reactive dye 
causing an increase in amount of dye adsorbed (A l-Degs et al., 2000; Santhy and Selvapathy, 2006; 
Vadivelan and Kumar, 2005).  
Figure 4-17 to Figure 4-20 presents the in fluence of electrolyte concentration at 100 ˚C and recipe pH 
value of the shades on activated carbon adsorp tion and it was observed that the mass of dye 
adsorbed increased as the electrolyte concentration increases. The increase in adsorption capacity [(mg dye/g carbon) / (mg dye/L)] ranged from 61. 85 to 98.20 for Navy shade; 57.94 to 89.04 for Black 
shade; 3.129 to 5.061 for Beige shade and 39.93 to 60.74 for Turquoise shade. NaCl and Na
2SO 4 are 
neutral salts that act as catalysts in the reactive dyeing; the need for pH change to basic (pH 11) for 
higher adsorption between dye and the carbon is necessary (Ahmed, 2005).  
High amount of dye uptake by powdered activated carbon was observed at high temperature, high 
electrolyte concentration and low pH values. 
Table 4.3 showed that in every case the r-va lue for the Freundlich model was greater than the 
corresponding value for the Langmuir model. The r value for Freundlich model was greater than 0.90 for 87% of the tests and greater than 0.95 for 72 % of the tests; while for the Langmuir model the 
highest r value was 0.88. According to Arslanoglu and co-workers (2004) and Kim (2004) higher coefficients of determination of isotherm are used  to determine the best fit model. The Freundlich 
adsorption parameters and r values using linear regression analysis for the different shades are presented in Table 4.3 for different temperatures, pH values and electrolyte concentrations respectively. In the Freundlich isotherm model, the parameter k
F is a measure of adsorption capacity, 
whereas the parameter n is a measure of adsorption bond strength. A large kF value [(in mg dye per 
gram of carbon) / (mg dye per litre)] indicates a larger adsorption capacity and a higher n value 
indicates a stronger adsorption bond (Kim, 2004). A ccording to the results obtained in Table 4.4 
similar results were observed in all the four shades; the kF values obtained increased as the 
temperature increases, increased as the pH value decreases (from pH 11 to pH 4) and increased as 
the electrolyte increases). Large kF values of about 94, 89, 5 and 61 [(mg dye/g carbon)/(mg dye/L)]for 
Navy, Black, Beige and Turquoise shades respectively, were observed at 100 ˚C, pH 4 and high 
electrolyte concentrations. There was not much diffe rence in bond strength between activated carbon 
and reactive dyes at different temperatures, pH valu es and electrolyte concentrations. Bond strength 
for Navy, Black and Turquoise (ranged from 2.738 to 5.941) were higher that Beige (ranged from 1.263 to 2.175). All the n values obtained for all the studied shades were between 1 and 10, this 
indicated favourable adsorption (Arslanoglu et al., 2004; Santhy and Selvapathy, 2006). The 
adsorption results obtained for the removal of t he four shades showed the possibility of decreasing the  
45 
 pH or using higher concentrations of salt to achi eve higher dye removals. If the pH value were to be 
decreased to around a value of 4, it would have to  be neutralised to a value of 7 before reuse. The 
amount of salt discharged to drain would need to be evaluated before dyeing in higher salt 
concentrations could be considered. The use of dyeing at higher te mperatures (above 60 ˚C) need to 
be carefully considered due to t he adverse effect on the ability to  control shade consistency. 
The treatment of dye bath with activated carbon is presented in Table 4.5. From Chapter 3 it was 
shown that the dye bath effluent contains about 430 mg/L for Navy shade, 370 mg/L for Black shade, 
65 mg/L for Beige shade and 270 mg/L for Turquoise shade. In all the selected shades the dye bath effluent is at 60 ˚C. The treatment of the 60 ˚C Navy shade effluent with a gram activated carbon will 
treat 0.05 kg fabric, i.e. about 0.53 L effluent. Fo r treatment of Black, Beige and Turquoise shades 
effluent, a gram of carbon will treat about 0.08 kg f abric, i.e. 0.78 L effluent; 0.04 kg fabric, i.e. 
0.37 L effluent and 0.07 kg fabric, i.e. 0.71 L effluent  respectively. A colour removal of above 95% was 
observed starting from 3 g to 5 g carbon for all t he studied shades in the adsorption equilibrium tests 
undertaken. 
Tables 4.6 to 4.9 and Fig 4.21 show the mass ba lance for the dyeing and adsorption of the four 
different shades. The treatment of dye bath with  activated carbon showed dye bath effluent can be 
reclaimed. The possibility exist for re-use of 97% salt, 25% water and 32% energy (Table 4.5); 96% salt, 14% water and 17% energy (Table 4.6); 94% salt, 20% water and 23% energy (Table 4.7); and 
96% salt, 20% water and 32% energy (Table 4.8)  for Navy; Black; Beige and Turquoise shades 
respectively. The removal of colour from dye bath using activated carbon of all the shades represents 36% up to 53% of the total colour in the effluent. First rinse stream ( S2) has a low salt concentration. 
The possibility exists for the further concentration of the S2 effluent by a membrane process. The 
permeate from membrane process can be re-used for the first rinse and the concentrate can join exhausted dye bath effluent ( S1) (see figs B.1 to B.4, Appendix B). 
4.5 Conclusion 
 The best adsorption for the four reactive dye shades studied occurred at high temperature, low 
pH and high electrolyte concentration. 
 Based on determination of coefficients, the adsorption of the reactive dyes studied was better 
fitted by the Freundlich isotherm model. 
 Hot decolourised water with salt was recovered after adsorption of the reactive dyes and this 
implies significant water, salt and energy savings. 
From the textile industry perspecti ve the discharged dye is at 60 ˚C and high pH of about 11. 
Advantage of neutralising the effluent and heating to 100 ˚C with high salt concentrations is needed for 
best possible adsorption of the reactive dyes shad es studied. The results obtained in this chapter 
predicted the performance of PAC in the removal of colour from reactive dye bath for re-use purposes. The adsorption kinetics of the selected reactive dye shades were subsequently evaluated using GAC 
in a packed column ( Chapter 5 ). The temperature had to be evaluat ed since it was the major factor 
that influenced the adsorption of the reactive dyes studied in this chapter. The results obtained form a 
basis for evaluating the temperature effect on column  systems, which is pres ented in the subsequent 
chapter.

5 COLUMN  TESTS 
As stated in the previous chapter temperature and salt concentration were the major factors that 
influenced adsorption equilibrium with pH a minor factor. The possibility of reuse of recovered hot 
decolourised water with salt was observed from Chapter 4 . Due to poor handling, transport and 
disposal concerns of PAC, GAC has been used fo r column plants because of its advantages. The 
carbon of the same type as in Chapter 4  was used in this chapter; the only difference was that the 
carbon used in Chapter 4  was in powder form. The performance of GAC on column system was 
evaluated to determine the reactive dye kinetics in volved in the adsorption process. The study of 
column adsorption behaviour and kinetics is necess ary for the information required for the design and 
operation of adsorption equipment for wastewater treatment. Column adsorption behaviour is a 
prerequisite during modelling of the adsorption ki netics and the behaviour of the adsorbent. This was 
done to determine the breakthrough conditions fo r a dye solution. This chapter discusses the 
adsorption behaviour of F-400 granular activated carbon studied in column test. The experimental 
methods used, followed by experimental work and the discussion of the results obtained and lastly the 
conclusion of the experimental results are presented in this chapter.  
5.1 Experimentation  
A representative sample of the appropriate gran ular activated carbon was sieved with -1 mm and 
+0.95 mm screen. The average 1 mm GAC sample was oven dried for 3 h at 150 C. The 30 g sample 
of oven dried GAC was boiled for 2 h, to ensure re moval of air and then closely packed into a jacketed 
glass column of 200 mm length and 26 mm internal diameter. The bed was supported and closed off with glass wool, which also ensures good liquid dist ribution. The column was sealed with rubber bungs 
and silicone sealer to avoid leaking of liquid. The column was clamped to a burette stand and water from the water bath was pumped through the outer walls of the column to maintain a constant temperature. A temperature contro ller with an accuracy of ±3 C ˚, manufactured by Labcon was used. 
Polystyrene chips were distributed on top of the wate r bath to avoid loss in heat. A representative dye 
solution to be tested was continuously fed into a co lumn at a constant flow rate. A digital flow control 
peristaltic pump (Watson- Marlow 101U/R) was calibrated and used to feed the column. The pump flowrate was measured before and after each test. The difference never exceeded 0.003 mL/min. The 
pump has a maximum flow of up to 53 mL/min at 32 rpm (maximum recommended speed). The 102R pump head accept continuous tubing or elements. Th e dye solution was fed through a bed of granular 
activated carbon in down flow. Samples of the effluent were collected periodically and analyzed for the remaining dye concentration using a Cary UV/Visible spectrophotometer (model with curvette of 1 cm). 
The salt concentration and pH were measured us ing Jenway conductivity meter 4310 and a Jenway 
pH meter 3310. Fresh carbon was used for each experiment.  
Two experiments were undertaken in parallel, first Navy and Black and then Turquoise and Beige. A 
single batch (20 L) of dye solution was made for each  test. It was stored in plastic buckets with lids a 
cold room (4 ˚C). The column loading took between 10 and 14 days and the column was immediately 
regenerated. Effluent samples were analysed for co lour (ADMI) on the day of sampling. Regeneration 
took 1 day. After standing overnight  the next loading cycle commenced. 
A schematic diagram of the experimental set-up is shown in Figure 5-1. Column calculations

 5.3 Discussion 
Breakthrough curves of C t/C0 versus volume treated were obtained at constant flowrate 
(0.625 mL/min) for all four shades at different temperatures (20, 40, 60 ˚C) and are shown in Figs 5.2 
to 5.5. The two temperatures 20 ˚C and 40 ˚C were evaluated to check the effect of column 
temperature but only 60 ˚C temperature results will be discu ssed in terms of breakthrough and 
exhaustion of the column (see Table 5.1 and 5.2). The reason for choosing 60 ˚C is that all the dyeing 
of the four shades selected is performed at 60 ˚C. Thus the effluent to be treated will be at the same 
temperature, provided it is treat ed immediately as there might be a possibility of a drop in temperature 
if it is not treated immediately (thus the reason for evaluating 20 ˚C and 40 ˚C). 
The breakthrough time and volume increased as the temperature increased and it was observed that 
the exhaustion point decreased as t he temperature increased. This may be due to that the increase in 
temperature allowed the swelling of the activated carbon pores, which led to a higher dye-uptake. The 
acceptable limit (AL) (75 ADMI) for reuse for all t he shades in terms of concentrations are summarised 
in Table 2.2 of Chapter 2. The acceptable concentrations based on 75 ADMI for Navy and Black shades are 3 mg dye/L, for Beige and Turquoise ar e 41, 5 mg dye/L respectively. For treatment at 
60˚C for Navy and Black shades, the AL was at 14 and 21 bed volumes respectively. Treatment of 
Beige and Turquoise shades, the AL  was at 45 and 24 bed volumes respectively. The flow through the test column was continued until the dye concentration of column effluent (C
t) was about 0.95C 0, 
which indicated the exhaustion point (Eckenfelder, 2 000) and exhaustion capacity results are shown in 
Table 5.2. 
Changes in flowrates were evaluated at 0.625 and 6 mL/min flowrates at 60 ˚C and the breakthrough 
curves are shown in Figure 5-6 to Figure 5-9. It is evident from the results obtained in Tables 5.2 to 
5.3 that as the flow rate increas ed, the service times were shortened.  As the flowrate decreased, the 
breakthrough time increased and longer service times were achieved. The AL for reuse for Navy, 
Black, Beige and Turquoise shades were at 11, 10, 34 and 10 bed volumes respectively. The variation 
in the breakthrough curve and adsor ption capacity may be explained on the basis of mass transfer 
zone. Increase in flowrates caused the increase in zone speed, which resulted in decrease in time required to achieve breakthr ough (Perry and Chilton, 1973). 
At 60 ˚C and a flowrate of 0.625 mL/min to AL, a gram of  activated carbon, will treat 0.33 kg fabric of 
Navy shades, 0.50 kg fabric of Black shade, 1 kg of  Beige shade fabric and 0.50 kg fabric Turquoise 
shade before breakthrough occurs. The values of carb on capacity per kg of fabric (Table 5.1) and 
exhaustion capacity (Table 5.2) obt ained from column test (ranged from 17 to 97 mg dye per gram 
carbon) are much lower than those of adsorption equ ilibrium tests (ranged from 20 to 521 mg dye per 
gram carbon) ( see Chapter 4 ). This indicates that the column tests were not  run under equilibrium 
conditions.  
An important factor that had affected the column test  results was the influence of the wall effect (ratio 
of column inner diameter to average particle diam eter). According to Couteau and Mathaly (1997), the 
minimum value of 39 was considered to be sufficient  to eliminate the wall effect problem although 
Crittenden and co-workers (1991), the minimum value to avoid channelling was 50. For the column tests evaluated the wall effect ratio was too low (26). Small particles of activated carbon are 
appropriate for the operation but some operational  requirements such as ease of handling and low 
pressure drop in adsorption bed define the lower limit  of particle size. For the system design discussed 
in Chapter 7  one column test was repeated correcting t he shortcomings of the methodology used in 
this Chapter. The wall effect ratio was taken into  account following Crittenden and co-workers design 
model (Crittenden et al., 1991).  
53 
 5.4 Conclusion 
 For a fixed flow, higher temperatures delay the breakthrough for all the selected shades. High 
adsorptive capacities for AL ranging from 20 to 39 mg dye per gram carbon were observed for 
60˚C (highest temperature for this column st udy) for all the shades evaluated. For low 
temperature (20 ˚C), the adsorptive capacity ranged from 2 to 16 mg dye per gram carbon. 
 Higher temperatures exhaust the carbon quick er than low temperatures. The dye volumes for 
95% exhaustion ranged from 81 to 89 bed volumes for high temperature (60 ˚C) while for low 
temperature (20 ˚C) was 85 to 102 bed volumes. 
 A decrease in flow rate increases the adsorptio n capacity of the column for AL. The carbon 
capacity at low flow rate ranged from 20 to 37 mg dye per gram carbon while at high flow rate 
ranged from 15 to 20 mg dye per gram carbon. 
In this chapter the adsorption dye kinetics on activated carbon were investigated and the effect of 
temperature on breakthrough curv e and exhaustion point was obs erved. The advantage of using 
granular activated carbon for treatment of wastewat er is the possibility of regeneration. The granular 
activated carbon exhausted with reactive dye was chemically regenera ted for re-adsorption 
processes. The information from column test was usef ul for the design of column for pilot-scale use, 
which is presented in Chapter 7 .

6 REGENERATION 
The main objective of the regeneration treatment pr ocess is to re-establish the adsorptive capacity of 
the carbon for the adsorption of re active dye, increase the useful ness of GAC and reduce costs for 
GAC and waste treatment. Regeneration of the adsor bent material is of crucial importance in the 
economic development. The saturated granular activated carbon which was used for dye removal in Chapter 5  was subjected to regeneration. This chapter  discusses the chemical regeneration of 
saturated F-400 granular activated carbon used in the column tests. A brief background on regeneration, experimental methods used, followed by discussion of the results and lastly conclusion 
that can be drawn from the experimental results are presented in this chapter. 
6.1 Background 
Activated carbons that are used for the removal of  organic compounds from liquid phase systems will 
gradually become saturated, due to the concentr ation of contaminants on  the surface of the 
adsorbent. When this occurs a decision must be made on how to deal with the spent material (Clark and Lykins, 1989). Due to the high manufacturing costs and the recovery of components adsorbed on 
the surface of activated carbon, regeneration is the preferred option. The possibility of regeneration is 
one of the main reasons for the wide-spread use of activated carbon as an adsorbent (Zolfl et al., 2000). There are three potential regeneration techni ques: chemical, steam and  thermal. Advantages 
of having a regeneration system are as follows: 
 System is reliable from a process standpoint 
 Reduces solid waste handling problems caused by disposal of spent carbon 
 Saves up to 50% of the carbon cost (EPA, 2000) 
Thermal regeneration is the mostly common appl ied regeneration method but due to high costs 
resulting from energy used and effluent gas treatment  further alternative rege neration processes have 
been investigated. Thermal regeneration studies performed by Abdul and Campbell (1996) showed that a significant deterioration of the GAC pore structure resulted in  reduced adsorption surface area. 
Due to this, many chemicals have been tested for the regeneration of activated carbon to treat 
wastewater. Studies by Huling and co-workers (2005) concluded that chemical regeneration of 
activated carbon was not an economic ally viable process and the overa ll feasibility of the process was 
based on chemical costs and disposal of concentra ted effluent. Studies performed by Sorlini and 
Collivignarelli (2005) proved  that base-acid r egeneration for granular activa ted carbon system was the 
best amongst base, acid and thermal regeneration process for the removal of organics. The removal efficiency ranged from 50% to 60% for base-acid regeneration, 40% to 50% for thermal regeneration and about 20% for base and acid regeneration  
6.2 Experimentation 
The chemical regeneration procedure used for th is study was developed by  Santhy and Selvapathy 
(Santhy and Selvapathy, 2005). Exper iments were carried out for the desorption of the four shades 
studied using 1 M NaOH as the eluent. The influent was allowed to percolate through the saturated carbon bed of 70.6 mL at a flow rate of 0.625 mL/m in (see Figure 6-1 for first regeneration). From 
these results it was assumed that 3 bed volumes of 1 M NaOH would be sufficient. After the desorption of the shades, the car bon bed was washed with volumes of distilled water three times to  
55 
 remove the free alkali. A volume of 50 mL of 1 M HCl at a flow rate of 0.625 mL/min was washed 
through the column to neutralize any residual alkalinity. The carbon bed was finally washed with distilled water and the next cycle of operation of removal of dye from solution was performed. The 
process of adsorption and regeneration of carbon beds were repeated over 4 cycles of operation. The 
adsorption process was performed as described in Chapter 5 . 
6.3 Results 
This section presents results obtained from the ch emical regeneration of granular activated carbon 
tests for four different shades; Navy, Black, Be ige and Turquoise. Figure 6-1 presents elution using 
1 M NaOH. The column breakthrough curves obtained using regenerated granular activated carbon is 
shown in Figure 6-2 to Figure 6-5. Table 6.1 pr esents the exhaustion time for the regenerated carbon 
for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th cycles. Experimental data for regeneration is presented in Appendix E.

6.4 Discussion 
The flow through the tested column was continued un til the dye concentration of column effluent (C t) 
was about 0.95C 0, which indicated the exhaustion point (E ckenfelder, 2000).The elution of granular 
activated carbon was achieved using 1 M NaOH fo llowed by 1 M HCl (Figure 6-1). About 3 bed 
volumes were sufficient for almost complete desorpti on of the four shades. From the results shown in 
Appendix E , the dye recovery for Navy, Black, Beig e and Turquoise shades was 748, 765, 187 and 
675 mg dye/L respectively. The percent recovery for the first cycle at 60 ˚C for Navy, Black, Beige and 
Turquoise was 97, 98, 99 and 97 % respectively. The column tests with regenerated carbon were 
performed at 60 ˚C. According to Table 6.1, the bed volu mes treated for Navy and Black shades, the 
AL were at 14; 11 and 1; and  21, 14 and 8 for the first, second and third cycles respectively. The bed 
volumes treated for AL for Beige shade were at 45;  35 and 30 for the first, second and third cycles 
respectively. The AL for reuse for Turquoise shade were at 24, 15 and 7 bed volumes treated for the first, second and third cycles respectively.  
At least three cycles of regeneration were carried ou t within the standard limit for reuse. Significant 
deterioration of the carbon was observed at the fourth cycle. A small decline in GAC adsorption 
capacity was observed from the first to the third regeneration cycles. T he role of dye auxiliaries on the 
activated carbon were not evaluated in  the study and it is possible t hat they could have major effects 
that are detrimental on the performance of ac tivated carbon. The auxiliary mixtures are often 
developed to solve problems specific to the proces s and to counteract or enhance the effects of other 
chemicals (Hendrickx and Boardman, 1995). Accordi ng to Huling et al. (2005) there are two general 
mechanisms that could adversely affect the adsorpt ion capacity of the regenerated carbon. The first 
mechanism is the change in physical and chemical characteristics of GAC because of oxidative  
58 
 treatment. The second mechanism is the accumula tion of by-products caused by incomplete 
transformation of the target com pounds at adsorption sites. The change in adsorption capacity of 
regenerated carbon was postulated to be due to t he accumulation of reactive dyes and possibly 
reaction by-products, which may have blocked adsorption sites.  
6.5 Conclusion 
 NaOH elution can regenerate the spent F-400 gra nular activated carbon exhausted with reactive 
dyes up to 3 regeneration cycles. 
 Fewer bed volumes were treated as the regenerated carbon was used. As regenerated carbon 
was used less carbon capacity was observed. 
 The removal of dyes with regenerated carbon within the limit for reuse was observed up to 3 
cycles of operation.  
The effectiveness of chemical regeneration of satu rated carbon using NaOH was not satisfactory in 
terms of industrial application because of the number  of cycles achieved. The results obtained showed 
that the use NaOH compared to other chemical  regenerants need to be investigated for the 
implementation of activated carbon for removal of reactive dyes. The overall results from Chapter 3  to 
6 showed the possibility of designing a pilo t scale system, which is presented in Chapter 7 .  
59 
  
7 SYSTEM  DESIGN 
From Chapter 4  and Chapter 5 , the possibility of recovery of hot decolourised water with salt from 
reactive dye bath was shown to be possible by  adsorption studies and chemical regeneration 
(Chapter 6 ). A laboratory-scale column with a small diameter, filled with carbon was tested and the 
dye solution was run through the column to obtain data that were used for adsorption and design. The 
rapid small-scale column test methodology which uses  mass transfer similarity criteria to allow scale 
up of the test results to the full size column was evaluated for design purposes. The design of adsorption systems requires column tests similar to  the actual operation of full-scale systems.  
In Chapter 5  the wall effect of the particle diameter to  column diameter ratio was not taken into 
account, thus before designing an adsorption column for this study. One column test for Navy shade 
at 60 ˚C was performed with column internal diameter to particle diameter ratio of 50. The main 
objective of this chapter is to design an adsorption plant using the information obtained from the improved column (column: particle ratio of 50) adsorption study. 
The column effluent was monitored for the contaminant  of interest. For water treatment applications, 
the attainment of a specific effluent concentration is more critical than breakthrough. Thus, both the 
dye effluent and initial breakthrough are employed to analyze the data. The first information from the 
breakthrough curve is the cumulative number of bed volumes to breakthrough. In this chapter; mostly 
comparison of small-scale to full-scale operation will be made. A brief introduction on scaling up using 
RSSCT was presented in Chapter 2  and the design methodology using the information collected is 
shown in Section 7.1. 
7.1 Design 
The RSSCT design of one of the four shades is pres ented in section 7.1.1 and the design is shown in 
section 7.1.2. 
7.1.1 Small column design 
The calculations presented are for the Navy shad e only. Design calculations for the other three 
shades can be done using a similar method. The breakthrough curve for design obtained at 60 ˚C 
Navy Shade is shown in Figure 7-1 and the experimental data presented in Appendix E .

In this study the minimum value of superficial Reynolds number ( ReS) of 1 was selected. According to 
Crittenden and co-workers (1991), a value of 1 for ReS usually yields good results but lower values 
can be selected if head loss and column length are unacceptable. The minimum Reynolds number 
guarantees the effects of dispersion and the exter nal mass transfer of the large column must be 
greater than in the RSSCT

8 CONCLUSIONS  AND  RECOMMENDATIONS 
In this study four different dye classes were inve stigated (Drimarene HF, Cibacron S, Procion HE and 
Remazol Levafix using four standard shades (Nav y, Black, Beige and Turquoise). The reactive 
dyestuffs contained different functional groups (chemi stries). Reactive dye exhaustion to the fibre for 
the four reactive dye classes was about 80%, i.e. 20% remains in the effluent. Reactive dyeing of the 
four studied shades resulted in salt concentration s over 90% and hot coloured water remaining in the 
dye bath effluent. The efficiency of the dyeing proces s for a specific shade is associated with various 
parameters such as substantivity and diffusion rate of  dyes, hardness of water, pH and temperature of 
the dye liquor, type and concentration  of reactive dye used. The use of granular activated carbon for 
the adsorption of reactive dyes has been exam ined and results obtained indicated that activated 
carbon could effectively remove colour from exhaust ed reactive dye bath effluent and allow re-use of 
hot decolourised water with high concentration of salt. 
From the adsorption results obtained using activat ed carbon it was concluded that the most important 
factor influencing the adsorption rate and capacity for the reactive dye shades studied is the adsorption temperature. Textile processes require ho t water for reactive dyeing of cotton. There is 
great potential in the textile industry for hot water recovery. The use of heat exchangers to transfer 
heat to the incoming dyeing feed water can be eliminated when using granular activated carbon columns. The pH values and electrolyte concentration also played a vital role in the whole adsorption 
process and particularly in adsorption capacity. Colo ur removal of 100%, salt recovery of 94 to 97% 
and energy savings 17 to 32% in the dye bath efflu ent were achieved. Reactive dyeing of cotton is 
performed at high temperatures and in this  study the results were discussed based on 60 ˚C, which 
was the common temperature used for dyeing for all four shades selected. 
The breakthrough time from colu mn breakthrough curves for 60 ˚C were at 14, 21, 45 and 24 bed 
volumes for Navy, Black, Beige and Turquoise shades respectively. The exhaustion or saturation times for the granular activated carbon were at 24, 41, 45 and 35 bed volumes for Navy, Black, Beige and Turquoise shades respectively. The variation in the slope of the breakthrough curve may be 
explained on the basis of mass transfer fundament als of adsorption capacity of granular activated 
carbon. Increase in flowrate caused an increase in  zone speed, resulting in decrease in the time 
required to achieve breakthrough, while a decrease in flowrate resulted in an increased breakthrough 
time. This was due to decreased contact time between  the dye and carbon at higher flow rates.  
From the column test results shown, the values of carbon capacity per kilogram  of fabric obtained from 
the column test were mu ch lower than those of the adsorptio n equilibrium test. The reason is that 
more of the adsorption sites ar e exposed in PAC than in the GAC and the process is faster when 
using PAC. The Freundlich isothe rms measured in the adsorption equilibrium experiments do not 
apply to the column tests, perhaps due to that the equilibrium is not reached in column tests. One of 
the advantages of using GAC in the column test is  the possibility of regeneration. From studies 
presented in the literature; it was shown that the required water quality for textile process is not stated. 
The textile industries are using drinking water qualit y for dyeing, therefore the 75 ADMI could be used 
as the standard limit when treating water for reacti ve dyeing reuse. Dyeing  of the same shades or 
dyeing of a darker shade with treated light sh ade effluent would not need drinking water quality. 
The regenerated carbon for this study was found to be  effective up to 3 cycles of operation within the 
acceptable limit for reuse. Significant deterioration of  the carbon was observed at the fourth cycle. The  
65 
 poor performance could be associated with role of  dye auxiliaries in the ov erall adsorption process 
because of their unknown compos ition and chemistry (this was not divulged by the manufacturer for 
confidentiality. This led to the activated carbon not economically feasible for industrial application. 
Fewer bed volumes were treated when using regenerated carbon compared to virgin carbon. The possibility of savings exists when using regener ated GAC for treatment. Regeneration should also 
ensure that the eluted solution is not posing any disposal problems in terms of high acidity and high 
colour concentration. A further investigation of thermal regeneration of the spent granular activated 
carbon for the removal of reactive dyes is n eeded to determine its advantages and disadvantages 
over chemical regeneration. The design, operation and maintenance of carbon adsorption and 
regeneration processes depend on costs and characte ristics of textile water to be treated and the 
capacity of the plant. Therefore the designer is resp onsible for selecting a system that will meet the 
discharge permit requirements at the lowest cost possible. Once the optimum flowrate, bed depth and operating capacity of GAC is deter mined, the carbon contactors configurations can be estimated. The 
use of RSSCT method for designing in this stud y has the major potential advantage over other 
methods in predicting the performance of pilot-scal e. The carbon particle must be at least 1/50 of the 
column diameter to overcome the wall effect pr oblem. Small particles of activated carbon are 
appropriate for the operation but some operational  requirements such as ease of handling and low 
pressure drop in adsorption bed define the lower limit of particle size. 
Further research in this area should concentrate on evaluating different activated carbons and role of 
auxiliaries in activated carbon adsorption studies. When implementing the laboratory-scale plant in 
textile industry, the effect change in temperatur e, pH and electrolyte concentration should be noted 
and the chemical parameters should also be researc hed. The first rinse stream has a moderate colour 
with low salt concentration effluent. If further colour  removal is required, this stream could be treated 
by reverse osmosis. The permeate can be used for the first rinse and the concentrate can join dye 
bath effluent. The further investigation should also  be expanded to the evaluat ion of other chemical 
regenerants and thermal regeneration of saturated activated carbon. The use of GAC adsorption and 
the regeneration of GAC should also be taken into ac count for water, salt and energy savings for the 
textile industry. This study prov ed that the activated carbon adsorption technique is the solution in 
reactive dyeing textile industries be cause of the possibility for re-use of water, salt and energy; thus 
enabling environmental improvements with savings in salt, energy and water.
