Polymeric ion exchanger has been proven to be an excellent carrier for metal nanoparticles due to chem-
ical stability and robust mechanical strength. However, polymeric ion exchanger containing non-diffus-
ible negatively or positively charged groups can only permit cation or anion contaminants to permeate
into the polymer phase due to Donnan exclusion effect. In this study, zero-valent iron nanoparticles(NZVI) were immobilized within a chelating resin DOW 3N with pyridine functional groups throughNaBH
4reduction. TEM indicated that Fe0particles were clearly discrete and well dispersed on the surface
of DOW 3N with grain size ranging from 10 to 30 nm. The reduction ability of NZVI-DOW 3N for Pb2+,
NO/C0
3and their mixture were evaluated, respectively. The results showed that NO/C03and Pb2+can be
reduced efﬁciently. In a binary solution, the removal efﬁciencies of NO/C0
3and Pb2+can reach 87% and
97%, respectively.

1. Introduction
Due to excess use of fertilizers and pesticides in agriculture and
increased industrial activities, the groundwater and surface water
are at a serious risk of pollution in most countries of the world. Ni-
trate is possibly the most widespread groundwater contaminant in
the world, imposing a serious threat to drinking water supplies [1].
Excess NO/C0
3in drinking water can cause adverse health effects,
such as induction of ‘‘blue-baby syndrome’’ (methemoglobinemia),
especially in infants, and the potential formation of carcinogenic
nitrosamines. Heavy metals are highly reactive, bioaccumulative
and extremely toxic elements above threshold concentrations.
Toxic heavy metals in water are a growing threat to humanity
[2]. Some studies have shown the co-existence of nitrate and heavy
metal in natural water sources [3–5] . The co-existence of multiple
contaminants makes water utilities facing increased challenges in
providing safe drinking water.
Nanoscale zero valent iron (NZVI) has been extensively investi-
gated for removal of a variety of pollutants and can provide greaterreaction activity than conventional microscale materials. It has
been demonstrated that NZVI can efﬁciently reduce anion contam-ination such as ClO
/C0
4,N O/C0
3and heavy metals including Pb2+and
Ni2+[6–9] . However, there are some potential limitations during
application of NZVI. NZVI particles are prone to agglomerate into
larger ones due to the tendency to reduce the high surface energies
and intrinsic magnetic interaction [10], resulting in an adverse ef-
fect on both effective surface area and reduction performance; and
moreover, the release or escape of nanoparticles into the environ-
ment can result in nanotoxicity [11]. To overcome the aforemen-
tioned drawbacks, an effective strategy is to stabilize NZVI within
supporting materials, such as activated carbon [12,13] , zeolite
[14,15] , porous silica [10,16] , clay mineral [17] and polymeric resin
[18–20] .
Polymeric exchange resin has been proven to be an excellent
carrier for metal and metal oxide nanoparticles due to chemical
stability and robust mechanical strength [21]. Kim et al. [22] suc-
cessfully immobilized ZVI on a cationic exchange membrane for
dechlorination of trichloroethylene. Li et al. [18] immobilized NZVI
particles on a cation exchange resin, and NZVI-resin composite was
found to be highly effective in reductively debrominating decabro-
modiphenyl ether at ambient conditions. Shu et al. entrapped NZVI

in cation exchange resin and observed successfully decoloration of
acid blue 113 azo dye solution using NZVI-resin [23]. In addition to
cation exchange resin, anion exchange resin was also used as a car-
rier for preparing metal and metal oxide nanoparticles [19,24] .
Yang et al. immobilized Pd/Fe bimetallic nanoparticles within an
anion exchanger resin D201 for dechlorination of monochloroben-
zene, and monochlorobenzene was dechlorinated effectively to
benzene [25].
Although polymer ion exchanger resin is an excellent carrier for
NZVI, both cation exchanger and anion exchanger can only be
available for limited contaminates due to Donnan co-ion exclusion
effect [26,27] . The anion such as NO/C0
3, ClO/C0
4and AsO3/C0
4are excluded
from entering in the exchange phase of polymeric cation exchanger
containing non-diffusible anion groups. Similar to polymeric cation
exchanger, a high concentration of positively charged non-diffus-ible groups in an anion exchanger disallow permeation of cation
contaminates such as Pb
2+and Cu2+. It is well-recognized that
the cation and anion contaminates usually exist in the aqueous
solution simultaneously. Therefore, when NZVI supported on cat-
ion or anion exchange resin was used to treat wastewater contam-
inated cation and anion compounds simultaneously, only anion or
cation contaminants can be reduced due to Donnan exclusion
effect.
In this study, DOW 3N (DOWEX™M4195), which is composed
of a polystyrene cross-linked with divinyl benzene backbone and
bis(2-pyridylmethyl)amine functional groups, was chosen as a
supporting material for NZVI. The characterization of the NZVI-
DOW 3N was obtained by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), X-
ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron
microscope (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and BET-
N2adsorption technique. NO/C0
3and Pb2+were selected as model
compounds to examine the reduction ability of NZVI supported
on DOW 3N. The use of polymers containing pyridine groups for
supporting NZVI confers the following advantages: (1) the un-
charged functional groups of pyridine allow the anion and cation
contaminants to enter polymer phase; (2) Fe3+can be strongly che-
lated through pyridine groups containing N as donor atoms
[28,29] , therefore, the high content of NZVI immobilized can be at-
tained; (3) the release of iron ions into water can be avoided or
alleviated due to the strong chelating properties of its functional
groups. To the best of my knowledge, this is the ﬁrst attempt to
use DOW 3N immobilizing NZVI for simultaneous removal of inor-
ganic anion and heavy metal.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
DOW 3N (DOWEX™M4195) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich.
Cation and anion exchange resin (D001 and D201) were suppliedby Zhengguang Industrial Co., Ltd., China. Prior to use, the resins
were extracted with ethanol for 8 h in a Soxlet apparatus, and
washed by hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide. Their struc-
ture information is listed in Table 1 . All chemicals including iron
(III) chloride hexahydrate (FeCl 3/C16H2O), sodium borohydride
(NaBH 4), sodium nitrate (NaNO 3), lead (II) chloride (PbCl 2) and lead
(II) nitrate (Pb(NO 3)2) were analytical grade and used without fur-
ther puriﬁcation. All the solutions were prepared using ultrapure
water produced by a Millipore-Q system (Millipore Synergy).
2.2. Preparation and characterization of NZVI resins
First, 0.5 g DOW 3N and D001 were added into 250 mL ethanol–
water (V:V = 9:1) solution containing 3 g/L Fe3+, respectively. For
D201, 0.5 g polymer beads were added into 250 mL FeCl 3/C16H2O
hydrochloric acid-water (V:V = 1:1) solution with 3 g/L Fe3+. They
were rotated for 24 h at 30 /C176C. Then all the resins were rinsed sev-
eral times with ethanol and added into NaBH 4solution (2% in
mass), stirring by a blender under a N 2atmosphere for 2 h at
20/C176C. Finally, the resulting black beads were vacuum dried before
characterization and batch experiments. The products were named
as NZVI-DOW 3N, NZVI-D201, NZVI-D001, respectively.
The morphology of NZVI-DOW 3N was viewed with a scanning
electron microscopy (Hitachi-3400N). The high-resolution trans-
mission electron microscope (HR-TEM) image was taken on a
JEM-2100. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed
to analyze the surface chemistry of NZVI using a PHI5000 VersaP-
robe. The speciﬁc surface areas and the pore size distribution were
measured using an ASAP 2010 (Micromeritics Instrument Co.,
USA). The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was re-
corded using a NEXUS870 FTIR Spectrometer. The amount of Fe
loaded onto the polymeric hosts was determined by an atomic
absorption spectrophotometer (AA-6300C) after being extracted
by sulfuric acid solution (10 wt.%).
2.3. Experiments for chemical reduction
In the single solution, 44 mg/L nitrate and 100 mg/L Pb2+were
prepared using NaNO 3and PbCl 2, respectively. In order to avoid
the introduction of other ions, Pb(NO 3)2was used to prepare binary
solution of NO/C0
3and Pb2+, and the concentration of Pb2+and NO/C03in
binary solution was 103.5 mg/L and 62 mg/L, respectively. The pH
of the solution was adjusted using 0.1 mol/L hydrochloric acid.
All the batch experiments were carried out in three-neck ﬂacks
placed in water bath incubator at 25 /C176C. Typically, NZVI-resin com-
posites were mixed with 500 mL solution deoxygenated by N 2and
stirred with a mechanical stirrer. In order to keep an identical
amount of NZVI in the solution (0.36 g NZVI/L), different doses of
three kinds of NZVI-resin were added. At speciﬁc time interval,

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of NZVI-resin
Some important physicochemical properties of the solid sam-
ples employed in the study are shown in Table 1 . The iron content
in NZVI-DOW 3N was measured to be 90.10 mg/g. Compare with
host polymer, NZVI loading resulted in an increase of BET surface
area and a decrease in average pore diameter of NZVI-DOW 3N,
the BET surface areas increased from 17.69 m2/g to 27.91 m2/g
and the average pore diameter decreased from 10.38 nm to9.57 nm. The variety of pore size after NZVI loading on DOW 3N
could be observed clearly in Fig. S1 (Supplementary Material ). In
comparison with DOW 3N, an obvious increment of the pore vol-
ume was observed in the range of 2–30 nm pore diameter for
NZVI-DOW 3N due to ZVI loadings. The loaded NZVI particles
would block some inner pores or make the pores narrower. On
the other side, they could provide more accessible surface and
thereby increased the BET surface area.
It is learned from SEM and EDX images of DOW 3N and NZVI-
DOW 3N ( Fig. 1 ) that NZVI-DOW 3N exhibited a typical porous
structure. This result suggests that the NZVI was uniformly immo-
bilized into DOW 3N. In comparison with DOW 3N, more abundant
pore structure was observed in the surface of NZVI-DOW 3N,
which had been conﬁrmed by the value of speciﬁc surface area.
EDX analysis shows that the content of Fe was 1.08%, which waslower than 9.10% analyzed using atomic absorption spectrometer.
The different Fe content showed that Fe
0particles were mainly dis-
tributed in the inner pore surface of polymer bead, and that little of
them were on the external surface of polymer.

nanoparticles were clearly discrete and well dispersed on the

to spherical with grain size ranging from 10 to 30 nm.
XPS technique was employed to analyze the oxidation state of
the iron supported on the surface of DOW 3N. Fig. 3 shows XPS
Fe 2p spectra of NZVI-DOW 3N. The photoelectron peaks at
705.96 eV and 718.92 eV represented the binding energies of
Fe(2p 3/2) and Fe(2p 1/2) of zero-valent iron, respectively. The bind-
ing energies of Fe(2p 3/2) = 709.84 eV and Fe(2p 1/2) = 723.42 eV
were assigned to the oxidized iron [30]. It suggested that the sur-
face of NZVI consisted mainly of a layer of oxide ﬁlm which might
form during the vacuum drying process
The FTIR spectra of DOW 3N and NZVI-DOW 3N are shown in
Fig. 4 . The FTIR spectrum of DOW 3N showed four bands at
1589 cm/C01, 1569 cm/C01, 1433 cm/C01and 760 cm/C01which can be as-
signed to 2-picolylamine. All of these bands of DOW 3N wereshifted to higher wave number values (1590 cm
/C01, 1570 cm/C01,
1434 cm/C01, 762 cm/C01, respectively) in the spectrum of NZVI-
DOW 3N. The shifts may be due to the coordinative bond between
DOW 3N and iron [31]. The new absorption peak at 470 cm/C01in
the spectrum of NZVI-DOW 3N corresponding to Fe–O stretches
was observed [32]. These results can demonstrate that NZVI had
been successfully loaded onto DOW 3N and the surface of the NZVI
was partially oxidized, which were consistent with the results ob-
tained from XPS. The other new absorption peaks at 2200–
2400 cm/C01and 3209 cm/C01in the spectrum of NZVI-DOW 3N could
be attributed to the bending vibration of B–O which was the resid-
ual after the reduction of iron using NaBH 4(Fig. 4 ).3.2. Effect of Donnan membrane on removal of Pb2+andNO/C0

Fig. 5 shows comparison of Pb2+and NO/C0
3removal efﬁciency by
NZVI supported on three different supporters at different pH val-
ues. It can be clearly seen that nanoscale zero-valent iron sup-
ported cation or anion exchange resin showed poor reduction
capacities for anion contaminants (NO/C0
3) or cation contaminant
(Pb2+), respectively, while NZVI-DOW 3N can efﬁciently remove
both Pb2+and NO/C0
3. This phenomenon can result from different sur-
face chemistry properties of three supporters. In a polymeric cation
exchange resin (D001), negatively charged sulfonic acid groups are
covalently attached to the polymer chains, and thus, they cannot
permeate out of the polymer phase. Conversely, a polymeric anion
exchange resin (D201) contains a high concentration of non-diffus-
ible positively charged quaternary ammonium functional groups.Therefore, the high concentration of non-diffusible negatively or
positively charged functional groups within D001 and D201 will
prevent anion or cation contaminants from permeating into the
polymer phase due to Donnan exclusion effect [26,27] . Due to
non-existence of charged functional groups ﬁxed on matrix of
DOW 3N, NO
/C0
3and Pb2+can permeate into the polymer phase of
DOW 3N by diffusion.
Fig. 6 provides a schematic illustration of the difference among
cation and anion exchanger and polymers containing pyridine
groups as support materials. The presence of high concentration
of non-diffusing ﬁxed charges (N ðCH 3Þþ
3or SO/C0
3) in the polymer
phase exhibits a net positive or negative charge in the surface of
the polymer phase, which acts as a highly impermeable interface
for Pb2+or NO/C0
3. Donnan exclusion effect will inhibit the diffusion
of cationic or anionic contaminants [26,27] ,s oP b2+or NO/C0
3could
be only reduced on the external surface of ion exchanger and the
reduction capacity of nanoparticles loaded on exchanger will not
be fully attained. But DOW 3N contains only uncharged bis(2-pyr-
idylmethyl)amine functional groups, therefore, anion (NO/C0
3) and
cation (Pb2+) can successfully permeate into the polymer phase
without Donnan exclusion effect and be reduced by NZVI effec-
tively ( Fig. 6 ).
3.3. Reduction properties of NZVI-DOW 3N
3.3.1. Removal of anion contaminant ( NO/C0
3)
The efﬁciency on nitrate removal by NZVI-DOW 3N and DOW
3N was investigated and shown in Fig. 7 . As can be seen in Fig. 7
and 94% of nitrate removed by NZVI-DOW 3N was obtained within
480 min and much higher than 30% removal by DOW 3N due to the
adsorption. This result shows that NZVI-DOW 3N had the high
reduction efﬁciency for nitrate. Also, ammonium and nitrite were
detected in the aqueous solution, afﬁrming that NO/C0
3could be re-
duced at near neutral pH.
The reduction reaction of aqueous nitrate is a rather compli-
cated one with possible intermediates and products, including
NO 2,N O/C0
2, NO, N 2O, N 2,N H 2OH, N 2H4, and NH 3/NHþ
4. In this study,
the mass balance of total nitrogen species was calculated after the
reduction reaction was carried out for 480 min. As a result, the
overall amount of nitrogen species decreased 18% compared with
the initial amount, the decreased amount of nitrogen species in
the solution is probably due to the formation of ammonia gas or/
and nitrogen gas, or the adsorption of NO/C0
3and NO/C02by the sup-
porter, iron oxide and hydroxides which was formed during the
reduction reaction.
3.3.2. Removal of cation contaminant (Pb2+)
The removal of Pb2+from the aqueous solution with NZVI-DOW
3N and DOW 3N was shown in Fig. 8 . The equilibrium for Pb2+re-
moval from solution was reached within the ﬁrst 90 min using
NZVI-DOW 3N and 5 min using DOW 3N in the absence of NZVI.700 710 720 730 74070080090010001100Intensity

using NZVI-DOW 3N, while only 20.54% removal of Pb2+using
DOW 3N. The pH of the solution varied from 2.62 to 5.23 for re-
moval of Pb2+by NZVI-DOW 3N, indicating that lead oxides and
lead hydrates did not form during the removal of Pb2+[33]. There-
fore, it can be concluded that Pb2+removal from solution was
mainly reduced to Pb0;P b2+was ﬁrst absorbed onto DOW 3N by
chelating with pyridine groups containing N as donor atoms, and
then further reduced by NZVI.
3.3.3. Removal of NO/C0
3and Pb2+in binary solution by NZVI-DOW 3N
In order to better understand the reduction properties of NZVI-
DOW 3N, reduction of NO/C0
3and Pb2+in binary solution with initial
pH 5.33 by NZVI-DOW 3N was investigated. From the Fig. 9 ,i ti s
clearly learned that NZVI-DOW 3N showed high simultaneousremoval efﬁciency for Pb2+and NO/C0
3. Above 87% of nitrate was re-
moved and was mainly reduced to ammonium, afﬁrming that NO/C0
3
could be reduced at near neutral pH by NZVI-DOW 3N. Ammonium
accounts for about 98% of the reaction products and the overall
amount of nitrogen species was nearly equal to the initial amount.
However, the removal efﬁciency of NO/C0
3was about 94% without the
presence of Pb2+. The decrease of the removal efﬁciency for NO/C0
3in
binary solution was because that Pb2+may occupy the available ac-
tive sites, thereby lowering the NO/C0
3removal efﬁciency.
The removal efﬁciency of Pb2+was as high as 97%. It is found
that pH of the solution increased from 5.33 to 8.92 during the
reduction reaction of NO/C0
3and Pb2+. The high pH may led to the
transformation of Pb2+into lead oxides and lead hydrates on the
surface of NZVI-DOW 3N, enhancing the removal efﬁciency of
Pb2+. Therefore, if NO/C0
3was existed in the solution, it can furtherNZVI-D001 NZVI-D201 NZVI-DOW 3N020406080100Removal efficiency % pH=1.31

solution pH.
On the basis of the above results, it is possible for NZVI-DOW 3N
to offer great potential in treating wastewater contaminated cation
and anion compounds simultaneously.
4. Conclusions
In this study, nanozero valent iron was successfully immobi-
lized into DOW 3N containing bis(2-pyridylmethyl)amine func-
tional groups. EDX, XPS and FT-IR spectroscopy conﬁrmed the
formation of NZVI in the polymeric resin. The results obtained from
SEM indicated that NZVI loaded onto DOW 3N was well dispersed
with diameter ranging from 10 to 30 nm. NZVI loadings resulted in
a signiﬁcant increase in BET surface area from 17.69 m2/g to
27.91 m2/g.
Due to non-existence of Donnan exclusion effect, both NO/C0
3and
Pb2+can diffuse into the polymer phase of DOW 3N. Therefore,
NZVI-DOW 3N composite showed a high efﬁciency for removing
NO/C0
3and Pb2+from aqueous solution simultaneously. The removal
efﬁciency for Pb2+and NO/C0
3were 97% and 87% in binary solution,
respectively.
