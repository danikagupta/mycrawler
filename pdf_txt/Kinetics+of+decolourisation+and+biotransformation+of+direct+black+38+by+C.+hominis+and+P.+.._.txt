IARC MONOGRAPHS
In 1969, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) initiated a programme on the evaluation of the carcinogenic 
risk of chemicals to humans involving the production of critically evaluated monographs on individual chemicals. The programme 
was subsequently expanded to include evaluations of carcinogenic risks associated with exposures to complex mixtures, lifestyle factors and biological and physical agents, as well as those in specific occupations. The objective of the programme is to elaborate and publish in the form of monographs critical reviews of data on carcinogenicity for agents to which humans are known to be exposed and on specific exposure situa  tions; to evaluate these data in terms of human risk with the help of international working 
groups of experts in chemical carcinogenesis and related fields; and to indicate where additional research efforts are needed. The 
lists of IARC evaluations are regularly updated and are available on the Internet at http://monographs.iarc.fr/.
This programme has been supported since 1982 by Cooperative Agreement U01 CA33193 with the United States National 
Cancer Institute, Department of Health and Human Services. Additional support has been provided since 1986 by the Health, Safety and Hygiene at Work Unit of the European Commission Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, and since 1992 by the United States National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Department of Health and Human Services. The contents of this volume are solely the responsibility of the Working Group and do not necessarily represent the official views of the U.S. National Cancer Institute, the U.S. National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or the European Commission Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
This volume was made possible, in part, through Cooperative Agreement CR 834012 with the United States Environmental 
Protection Agency, Office of Research and Development. The contents of this volume do not necessarily reflect the views or policies of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Founder of the IARC Monographs  Programme
Lorenzo Tomatis, MD, with other colleagues knowledgeable in primary prevention and environmental carcino -
genesis, perceived in the 1960s the growing need to objectively evaluate carcinogenic risks by international groups of 
experts in chemical carcinogenesis. His vision and determination to provide a reliable source of knowledge and infor -
mation on environmental and occupational causes of cancer led to his creating the IARC Monographs  Programme for 
evaluating cancer risks to humans from exposures to chemicals. The first meeting, held in Geneva in December 1971, resulted in Volume 1 of the IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risk of Chemicals to Man [1972], a series known affectionately since as the “orange books”. As a champion of chemical carcinogenesis bioassays, Tomatis defined and promoted the applicability and utility of experimental animal findings for identifying carcinogens and for preventing cancers in humans, especially in workers and children, and to eliminate inequalities in judging cancer risks between industrialized and developing countries. Tomatis’ foresight, guidance, leadership, and staunch belief in primary prevention continued to influence the IARC Monographs  as they expanded to encompass personal habits, as 
well as physical and biological agents. Lorenzo Tomatis had a distinguished career at the Agency, arriving in 1967 and heading the Unit of Chemical Carcinogenesis, before being Director from 1982 to 1993.
Volume 100 of the IARC Monographs  Series is respectfully dedicated to him.

The term ‘carcinogenic risk’ in the IARC Monographs  series is taken to mean that an agent is 
capable of causing cancer. The Monographs  evaluate cancer hazards, despite the historical presence 
of the word ‘risks’ in the title.
Inclusion of an agent in the Monographs  does not imply that it is a carcinogen, only that the 
published data have been examined. Equally, the fact that an agent has not yet been evaluated in a 
Monograph  does not mean that it is not carcinogenic. Similarly, identification of cancer sites with 
sufficient evidence  or limited evidence  in humans should not be viewed as precluding the possibility 
that an agent may cause cancer at other sites.
The evaluations of carcinogenic risk are made by international working groups of independent 
scientists and are qualitative in nature. No recommendation is given for regulation or legislation.
Anyone who is aware of published data that may alter the evaluation of the carcinogenic risk 
of an agent to humans is encouraged to make this information available to the Section of IARC 
Monographs, International Agency for Research on Cancer, 150 cours Albert Thomas, 69372 Lyon Cedex 08, France, in order that the agent may be considered for re-evaluation by a future Working 
Group.
Although every effort is made to prepare the Monographs  as accurately as possible, mistakes may 
occur. Readers are requested to communicate any errors to the Section of IARC Monographs, so that corrections can be reported in future volumes.

Laurent Galichet’s colleagues gratefully acknowledge his years of service in the IARC Mono-
graphs  Programme, in particular his unrelenting efforts to modernize the production process of 
the Monographs . The new style and layout of the Volume 100 series are the fruits of these efforts. 
Laurent left the IARC in October 2011.PREAMBLE
The Preamble to the IARC Monographs  describes the objective and scope of the programme, 
the scientific principles and procedures used in developing a Monograph , the types of 
evidence considered and the scientific criteria that guide the evaluations. The Preamble 
should be consulted when reading a Monograph  or list of evaluations.
A. GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND 
PROCEDURES
1. Background
Soon after IARC was established in 1965, it 
received frequent requests for advice on the car -
cinogenic risk of chemicals, including requests 
for lists of known and suspected human carcino -
gens. It was clear that it would not be a simple 
task to summarize adequately the complexity of 
the information that was available, and IARC began to consider means of obtaining interna -
tional expert opinion on this topic. In 1970, the IARC Advisory Committee on Environmental Carcinogenesis recommended ‘...that a com -
pendium on carcinogenic chemicals be pre -
pared by experts. The biological activity and evaluation of practical importance to public 
health should be referenced and documented.’ 
The IARC Governing Council adopted a resolu -
tion concerning the role of IARC in providing 
government authorities with expert, independ -
ent, scientific opinion on environmental carcino -
genesis. As one means to that end, the Governing Council recommended that IARC should prepare 
monographs on the evaluation of carcinogenic risk of chemicals to man, which became the ini -
tial title of the series.
In the succeeding years, the scope of the pro -
gramme broadened as Monographs  were devel -
oped for groups of related chemicals, complex 
mixtures, occupational exposures, physical and 
biological agents and lifestyle factors. In 1988, the phrase ‘of chemicals’ was dropped from 
the title, which assumed its present form, IARC 
Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans .
Through the Monographs  programme, IARC 
seeks to identify the causes of human cancer. This is the first step in cancer prevention, which is 
needed as much today as when IARC was estab -
lished. The global burden of cancer is high and 
continues to increase: the annual number of new 
cases was estimated at 10.1 million in 2000 and 
is expected to reach 15 million by 2020 ( Stewart 
& Kleihues, 2003 ). With current trends in demo -
graphics and exposure, the cancer burden has been shifting from high-resource countries to low- and medium-resource countries. As a result 
of Monographs  evaluations, national health agen -
cies have been able, on scientific grounds, to take 
measures to reduce human exposure to carcino -
gens in the workplace and in the environment.
9IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
The criteria established in 1971 to evaluate 
carcinogenic risks to humans were adopted by the 
Working Groups whose deliberations resulted in 
the first 16 volumes of the Monographs  series. 
Those criteria were subsequently updated by fur -
ther ad hoc Advisory Groups ( IARC, 1977 , 1978 , 
1979 , 1982 , 1983 , 1987 , 1988 , 1991 ; Vainio et al ., 
1992 ; IARC, 2005 , 2006 ).
The Preamble is primarily a statement of sci -
entific principles, rather than a specification of working procedures. The procedures through 
which a Working Group implements these prin -
ciples are not specified in detail. They usually 
involve operations that have been established 
as being effective during previous Monograph  
meetings but remain, predominantly, the pre -
rogative of each individual Working Group.
2. Objective and scope
The objective of the programme is to pre -
pare, with the help of international Working Groups of experts, and to publish in the form of 
Monographs , critical reviews and evaluations of 
evidence on the carcinogenicity of a wide range 
of human exposures. The Monographs  repre -
sent the first step in carcinogen risk assessment, 
which involves examination of all relevant infor -
mation to assess the strength of the available evi -
dence that an agent could alter the age-specific incidence of cancer in humans. The Monographs  
may also indicate where additional research efforts are needed, specifically when data imme -
diately relevant to an evaluation are not available.
In this Preamble, the term ‘agent’ refers to 
any entity or circumstance that is subject to evaluation in a Monograph . As the scope of the 
programme has broadened, categories of agents now include specific chemicals, groups of related chemicals, complex mixtures, occupational or 
environmental exposures, cultural or behav -
ioural practices, biological organisms and physi -
cal agents. This list of categories may expand as causation of, and susceptibility to, malignant 
disease become more fully understood.
A cancer ‘hazard’ is an agent that is capable 
of causing cancer under some circumstances, while a cancer ‘risk’ is an estimate of the carci -
nogenic effects expected from exposure to a can -
cer hazard. The Monographs  are an exercise in 
evaluating cancer hazards, despite the historical 
presence of the word ‘risks’ in the title. The dis -
tinction between hazard and risk is important, 
and the Monographs  identify cancer hazards 
even when risks are very low at current exposure levels, because new uses or unforeseen exposures could engender risks that are significantly higher.
In the Monographs , an agent is termed ‘car -
cinogenic’ if it is capable of increasing the inci -
dence of malignant neoplasms, reducing their 
latency, or increasing their severity or multiplic -
ity. The induction of benign neoplasms may in 
some circumstances (see Part B, Section 3a) con -
tribute to the judgement that the agent is carci -
nogenic. The terms ‘neoplasm’ and ‘tumour’ are used interchangeably.
The Preamble continues the previous usage 
of the phrase ‘strength of evidence’ as a matter of historical continuity, although it should be 
understood that Monographs  evaluations con -
sider studies that support a finding of a cancer 
hazard as well as studies that do not.
Some epidemiological and experimental 
studies indicate that different agents may act at different stages in the carcinogenic process, and 
several different mechanisms may be involved. 
The aim of the Monographs  has been, from their 
inception, to evaluate evidence of carcinogenic -
ity at any stage in the carcinogenesis process, independently of the underlying mechanisms. Information on mechanisms may, however, be 
used in making the overall evaluation ( IARC, 
1991 ; Vainio et al ., 1992 ; IARC, 2005 , 2006 ; see 
also Part B, Sections 4 and 6). As mechanisms of carcinogenesis are elucidated, IARC convenes 
international scientific conferences to determine whether a broad-based consensus has emerged 
10Preamble
on how specific mechanistic data can be used 
in an evaluation of human carcinogenicity. The 
results of such conferences are reported in IARC 
Scientific Publications, which, as long as they still reflect the current state of scientific knowledge, 
may guide subsequent Working Groups.
Although the Monographs  have emphasized 
hazard identification, important issues may also involve dose–response assessment. In many 
cases, the same epidemiological and experimen -
tal studies used to evaluate a cancer hazard can 
also be used to estimate a dose–response relation -
ship. A Monograph  may undertake to estimate 
dose–response relationships within the range of the available epidemiological data, or it may 
compare the dose–response information from experimental and epidemiological studies. In 
some cases, a subsequent publication may be pre -
pared by a separate Working Group with exper -
tise in quantitative dose–response assessment.
The Monographs  are used by national and 
international authorities to make risk assess -
ments, formulate decisions concerning preventive measures, provide effective cancer control pro -
grammes and decide among alternative options 
for public health decisions. The evaluations of 
IARC Working Groups are scientific, qualita -
tive judgements on the evidence for or against 
carcinogenicity provided by the available data. 
These evaluations represent only one part of the 
body of information on which public health deci -
sions may be based. Public health options vary 
from one situation to another and from country 
to country and relate to many factors, including different socioeconomic and national priorities. 
Therefore, no recommendation is given with 
regard to regulation or legislation, which are the responsibility of individual governments or 
other international organizations.
3. Selection of agents for review
Agents are selected for review on the basis of 
two main criteria: (a) there is evidence of human exposure and (b) there is some evidence or sus -
picion of carcinogenicity. Mixed exposures may 
occur in occupational and environmental set -
tings and as a result of individual and cultural habits (such as tobacco smoking and dietary practices). Chemical analogues and compounds 
with biological or physical characteristics simi -
lar to those of suspected carcinogens may also 
be considered, even in the absence of data on a 
possible carcinogenic effect in humans or experi -
mental animals.
The scientific literature is surveyed for pub -
lished data relevant to an assessment of carci -
nogenicity. Ad hoc Advisory Groups convened 
by IARC in 1984, 1989, 1991, 1993, 1998 and 
2003 made recommendations as to which 
agents should be evaluated in the Monographs  
series. Recent recommendations are avail -
able on the Monographs  programme web site  
(http://monographs.iarc.fr). IARC may schedule other agents for review as it becomes aware of 
new scientific information or as national health 
agencies identify an urgent public health need related to cancer.
As significant new data become available 
on an agent for which a Monograph  exists, a re-
evaluation may be made at a subsequent meeting, 
and a new Monograph  published. In some cases it 
may be appropriate to review only the data pub -
lished since a prior evaluation. This can be useful for updating a database, reviewing new data to 
resolve a previously open question or identifying new tumour sites associated with a carcinogenic 
agent. Major changes in an evaluation (e.g. a new 
classification in Group 1 or a determination that a mechanism does not operate in humans, see Part 
B, Section 6) are more appropriately addressed by 
a full review.
4. Data for the Monographs
Each Monograph  reviews all pertinent epi -
demiological studies and cancer bioassays in 
experimental animals. Those judged inadequate 
11IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
or irrelevant to the evaluation may be cited but 
not summarized. If a group of similar studies is 
not reviewed, the reasons are indicated.
Mechanistic and other relevant data are also 
reviewed. A Monograph  does not necessarily 
cite all the mechanistic literature concerning 
the agent being evaluated (see Part B, Section 4). Only those data considered by the Working 
Group to be relevant to making the evaluation 
are included.
With regard to epidemiological studies, can -
cer bioassays, and mechanistic and other relevant data, only reports that have been published or accepted for publication in the openly available 
scientific literature are reviewed. The same publi -
cation requirement applies to studies originating 
from IARC, including meta-analyses or pooled 
analyses commissioned by IARC in advance of a 
meeting (see Part B, Section 2c). Data from gov -
ernment agency reports that are publicly avail -
able are also considered. Exceptionally, doctoral theses and other material that are in their final form and publicly available may be reviewed.
Exposure data and other information on an 
agent under consideration are also reviewed. In the sections on chemical and physical proper -
ties, on analysis, on production and use and on occurrence, published and unpublished sources of information may be considered.
Inclusion of a study does not imply accept -
ance of the adequacy of the study design or of the analysis and interpretation of the results, and 
limitations are clearly outlined in square brack -
ets at the end of each study description (see Part 
B). The reasons for not giving further considera -
tion to an individual study also are indicated in the square brackets.
5. Meeting participants
Five categories of participant can be present 
at Monograph  meetings.(a) The Working Group
The Working Group is responsible for the crit -
ical reviews and evaluations that are developed 
during the meeting. The tasks of Working Group 
Members are: (i) to ascertain that all appropriate data have been collected; (ii) to select the data rel -
evant for the evaluation on the basis of scientific merit; (iii) to prepare accurate summaries of the data to enable the reader to follow the reasoning 
of the Working Group; (iv) to evaluate the results 
of epidemiological and experimental studies on cancer; (v) to evaluate data relevant to the under -
standing of mechanisms of carcinogenesis; and (vi) to make an overall evaluation of the carci -
nogenicity of the exposure to humans. Working 
Group Members generally have published sig -
nificant research related to the carcinogenicity of 
the agents being reviewed, and IARC uses litera -
ture searches to identify most experts. Working Group Members are selected on the basis of (a) knowledge and experience and (b) absence of real 
or apparent conflicts of interests. Consideration 
is also given to demographic diversity and bal -
ance of scientific findings and views.
(b) Invited Specialists
Invited Specialists are experts who also have 
critical knowledge and experience but have 
a real or apparent conflict of interests. These 
experts are invited when necessary to assist in the Working Group by contributing their unique 
knowledge and experience during subgroup and 
plenary discussions. They may also contribute text on non-influential issues in the section on 
exposure, such as a general description of data 
on production and use (see Part B, Section 1). Invited Specialists do not serve as meeting chair 
or subgroup chair, draft text that pertains to the 
description or interpretation of cancer data, or participate in the evaluations.
12Preamble
(c) Representatives of national and 
international health agencies 
Representatives of national and interna -
tional health agencies often attend meetings 
because their agencies sponsor the programme 
or are interested in the subject of a meeting. Representatives do not serve as meeting chair or 
subgroup chair, draft any part of a Monograph,  
or participate in the evaluations.
(d) Observers with relevant scientific 
credentials 
Observers with relevant scientific credentials 
may be admitted to a meeting by IARC in limited 
numbers. Attention will be given to achieving a 
balance of Observers from constituencies with differing perspectives. They are invited to observe the meeting and should not attempt to influence 
it. Observers do not serve as meeting chair or 
subgroup chair, draft any part of a Monograph , 
or participate in the evaluations. At the meeting, 
the meeting chair and subgroup chairs may grant 
Observers an opportunity to speak, generally after they have observed a discussion. Observers 
agree to respect the Guidelines for Observers 
at IARC Monographs  meetings (available at  
http://monographs.iarc.fr).
(e) The IARC Secretariat
The IARC Secretariat consists of scientists 
who are designated by IARC and who have rel -
evant expertise. They serve as rapporteurs and participate in all discussions. When requested by the meeting chair or subgroup chair, they may 
also draft text or prepare tables and analyses.
Before an invitation is extended, each poten -
tial participant, including the IARC Secretariat, 
completes the WHO Declaration of Interests to 
report financial interests, employment and con -
sulting, and individual and institutional research 
support related to the subject of the meeting. 
IARC assesses these interests to determine whether there is a conflict that warrants some 
limitation on participation. The declarations are 
updated and reviewed again at the opening of 
the meeting. Interests related to the subject of the meeting are disclosed to the meeting par -
ticipants and in the published volume ( Cogliano 
et al., 2004 ).
The names and principal affiliations of par -
ticipants are available on the Monographs  pro -
gramme web site (http://monographs.iarc.fr) approximately two months before each meeting. 
It is not acceptable for Observers or third parties 
to contact other participants before a meeting or to lobby them at any time. Meeting participants 
are asked to report all such contacts to IARC 
(Cogliano et al. , 2005 ).
All participants are listed, with their princi -
pal affiliations, at the beginning of each volume. Each participant who is a Member of a Working Group serves as an individual scientist and not as 
a representative of any organization, government 
or industry.
6. Working procedures
A separate Working Group is responsible for 
developing each volume of Monographs . A vol -
ume contains one or more Monographs , which 
can cover either a single agent or several related agents. Approximately one year in advance of the 
meeting of a Working Group, the agents to be 
reviewed are announced on the Monographs  pro-
gramme web site (http://monographs.iarc.fr) and 
participants are selected by IARC staff in consul -
tation with other experts. Subsequently, relevant 
biological and epidemiological data are collected 
by IARC from recognized sources of information 
on carcinogenesis, including data storage and retrieval systems such as PubMed. Meeting par -
ticipants who are asked to prepare preliminary working papers for specific sections are expected to supplement the IARC literature searches with 
their own searches.
13IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
For most chemicals and some complex mix -
tures, the major collection of data and the prep -
aration of working papers for the sections on 
chemical and physical properties, on analysis, on production and use, and on occurrence are car -
ried out under a separate contract funded by the US National Cancer Institute. Industrial associ -
ations, labour unions and other knowledgeable 
organizations may be asked to provide input to 
the sections on production and use, although this involvement is not required as a general rule. 
Information on production and trade is obtained 
from governmental, trade and market research publications and, in some cases, by direct con -
tact with industries. Separate production data on some agents may not be available for a vari -
ety of reasons (e.g. not collected or made public 
in all producing countries, production is small). 
Information on uses may be obtained from pub -
lished sources but is often complemented by 
direct contact with manufacturers. Efforts are 
made to supplement this information with data from other national and international sources.
Six months before the meeting, the mate -
rial obtained is sent to meeting participants to prepare preliminary working papers. The work -
ing papers are compiled by IARC staff and sent, before the meeting, to Working Group Members and Invited Specialists for review.
The Working Group meets at IARC for seven 
to eight days to discuss and finalize the texts and to formulate the evaluations. The objectives 
of the meeting are peer review and consensus. 
During the first few days, four subgroups (cov -
ering exposure data, cancer in humans, cancer 
in experimental animals, and mechanistic and 
other relevant data) review the working papers, develop a joint subgroup draft and write sum -
maries. Care is taken to ensure that each study summary is written or reviewed by someone not associated with the study being considered. 
During the last few days, the Working Group 
meets in plenary session to review the subgroup drafts and develop the evaluations. As a result, the entire volume is the joint product of the Working Group, and there are no individually 
authored sections.
IARC Working Groups strive to achieve a 
consensus evaluation. Consensus reflects broad agreement among Working Group Members, but 
not necessarily unanimity. The chair may elect to poll Working Group Members to determine 
the diversity of scientific opinion on issues where 
consensus is not readily apparent.
After the meeting, the master copy is verified 
by consulting the original literature, edited and prepared for publication. The aim is to publish the volume within six months of the Working 
Group meeting. A summary of the outcome is 
available on the Monographs  programme web 
site soon after the meeting.
B. SCIENTIFIC REVIEW AND 
EVALUATION
The available studies are summarized by the 
Working Group, with particular regard to the 
qualitative aspects discussed below. In general, 
numerical findings are indicated as they appear in the original report; units are converted when 
necessary for easier comparison. The Working 
Group may conduct additional analyses of the published data and use them in their assessment 
of the evidence; the results of such supplemen -
tary analyses are given in square brackets. When 
an important aspect of a study that directly 
impinges on its interpretation should be brought 
to the attention of the reader, a Working Group comment is given in square brackets.
The scope of the IARC Monographs  pro -
gramme has expanded beyond chemicals to include complex mixtures, occupational expo -
sures, physical and biological agents, lifestyle factors and other potentially carcinogenic expo -
sures. Over time, the structure of a Monograph  
has evolved to include the following sections:
14Preamble
Exposure data
Studies of cancer in humans
Studies of cancer in experimental animals
Mechanistic and other relevant dataSummary
Evaluation and rationale
In addition, a section of General Remarks at 
the front of the volume discusses the reasons the agents were scheduled for evaluation and some 
key issues the Working Group encountered dur -
ing the meeting.
This part of the Preamble discusses the types 
of evidence considered and summarized in each section of a Monograph , followed by the scientific 
criteria that guide the evaluations.
1. Exposure data
Each Monograph  includes general informa -
tion on the agent: this information may vary sub -
stantially between agents and must be adapted accordingly. Also included is information on production and use (when appropriate), meth -
ods of analysis and detection, occurrence, and sources and routes of human occupational and environmental exposures. Depending on the 
agent, regulations and guidelines for use may be 
presented.
(a) General information on the agent
For chemical agents, sections on chemical 
and physical data are included: the Chemical 
Abstracts Service Registry Number, the latest pri -
mary name and the IUPAC systematic name are 
recorded; other synonyms are given, but the list 
is not necessarily comprehensive. Information 
on chemical and physical properties that are rel -
evant to identification, occurrence and biologi -
cal activity is included. A description of technical products of chemicals includes trade names, rel -
evant specifications and available information 
on composition and impurities. Some of the 
trade names given may be those of mixtures in which the agent being evaluated is only one of the ingredients.
For biological agents, taxonomy, struc -
ture and biology are described, and the degree of variability is indicated. Mode of replication, life cycle, target cells, persistence, latency, host 
response and clinical disease other than cancer 
are also presented.
For physical agents that are forms of radia -
tion, energy and range of the radiation are included. For foreign bodies, fibres and respir -
able particles, size range and relative dimensions 
are indicated.
For agents such as mixtures, drugs or lifestyle 
factors, a description of the agent, including its composition, is given.
Whenever appropriate, other information, 
such as historical perspectives or the description of an industry or habit, may be included.
(b) Analysis and detection
An overview of methods of analysis and 
detection of the agent is presented, including their sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility. 
Methods widely used for regulatory purposes are emphasized. Methods for monitoring human 
exposure are also given. No critical evaluation 
or recommendation of any method is meant or implied.
(c) Production and use
The dates of first synthesis and of first com -
mercial production of a chemical, mixture or 
other agent are provided when available; for 
agents that do not occur naturally, this informa -
tion may allow a reasonable estimate to be made 
of the date before which no human exposure to 
the agent could have occurred. The dates of first reported occurrence of an exposure are also pro -
vided when available. In addition, methods of synthesis used in past and present commercial production and different methods of production, 
15IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
which may give rise to different impurities, are 
described.
The countries where companies report pro -
duction of the agent, and the number of compa -
nies in each country, are identified. Available data 
on production, international trade and uses are 
obtained for representative regions. It should not, however, be inferred that those areas or nations 
are necessarily the sole or major sources or users 
of the agent. Some identified uses may not be current or major applications, and the coverage 
is not necessarily comprehensive. In the case of 
drugs, mention of their therapeutic uses does not necessarily represent current practice nor does it 
imply judgement as to their therapeutic efficacy.
(d) Occurrence and exposure
Information on the occurrence of an agent in 
the environment is obtained from data derived from the monitoring and surveillance of levels 
in occupational environments, air, water, soil, plants, foods and animal and human tissues. 
When available, data on the generation, per -
sistence and bioaccumulation of the agent are 
also included. Such data may be available from 
national databases.
Data that indicate the extent of past and pre -
sent human exposure, the sources of exposure, the people most likely to be exposed and the fac -
tors that contribute to the exposure are reported. 
Information is presented on the range of human 
exposure, including occupational and environ -
mental exposures. This includes relevant findings 
from both developed and developing countries. 
Some of these data are not distributed widely and 
may be available from government reports and other sources. In the case of mixtures, indus -
tries, occupations or processes, information is given about all agents known to be present. For processes, industries and occupations, a histori -
cal description is also given, noting variations in chemical composition, physical properties and levels of occupational exposure with date and place. For biological agents, the epidemiology of 
infection is described.
(e) Regulations and guidelines
Statements concerning regulations and 
guidelines (e.g. occupational exposure limits, maximal levels permitted in foods and water, 
pesticide registrations) are included, but they may not reflect the most recent situation, since 
such limits are continuously reviewed and modi -
fied. The absence of information on regulatory 
status for a country should not be taken to imply 
that that country does not have regulations with 
regard to the exposure. For biological agents, leg -
islation and control, including vaccination and 
therapy, are described.
2. Studies of cancer in humans
This section includes all pertinent epidemio -
logical studies (see Part A, Section 4). Studies of biomarkers are included when they are relevant 
to an evaluation of carcinogenicity to humans.
(a) Types of study considered
Several types of epidemiological study con -
tribute to the assessment of carcinogenicity in 
humans — cohort studies, case–control studies, 
correlation (or ecological) studies and interven -
tion studies. Rarely, results from randomized tri -
als may be available. Case reports and case series of cancer in humans may also be reviewed.
Cohort and case–control studies relate indi -
vidual exposures under study to the occurrence of cancer in individuals and provide an estimate of effect (such as relative risk) as the main measure 
of association. Intervention studies may provide 
strong evidence for making causal inferences, as exemplified by cessation of smoking and the sub -
sequent decrease in risk for lung cancer.
In correlation studies, the units of inves -
tigation are usually whole populations (e.g. in 
16Preamble
particular geographical areas or at particular 
times), and cancer frequency is related to a sum -
mary measure of the exposure of the population to the agent under study. In correlation studies, individual exposure is not documented, which 
renders this kind of study more prone to con -
founding. In some circumstances, however, cor -
relation studies may be more informative than analytical study designs (see, for example, the 
Monograph  on arsenic in drinking-water; IARC, 
2004 ).
In some instances, case reports and case series 
have provided important information about the carcinogenicity of an agent. These types of study 
generally arise from a suspicion, based on clinical 
experience, that the concurrence of two events — that is, a particular exposure and occurrence of 
a cancer — has happened rather more frequently 
than would be expected by chance. Case reports and case series usually lack complete ascertain -
ment of cases in any population, definition or enumeration of the population at risk and esti -
mation of the expected number of cases in the 
absence of exposure.
The uncertainties that surround the inter -
pretation of case reports, case series and corre -
lation studies make them inadequate, except in 
rare instances, to form the sole basis for inferring a causal relationship. When taken together with 
case–control and cohort studies, however, these 
types of study may add materially to the judge -
ment that a causal relationship exists.
Epidemiological studies of benign neo -
plasms, presumed preneoplastic lesions and other end-points thought to be relevant to cancer 
are also reviewed. They may, in some instances, 
strengthen inferences drawn from studies of cancer itself.
(b) Quality of studies considered
It is necessary to take into account the pos -
sible roles of bias, confounding and chance in 
the interpretation of epidemiological studies. Bias is the effect of factors in study design or 
execution that lead erroneously to a stronger or weaker association than in fact exists between an 
agent and disease. Confounding is a form of bias 
that occurs when the relationship with disease is made to appear stronger or weaker than it truly is 
as a result of an association between the apparent 
causal factor and another factor that is associated with either an increase or decrease in the inci -
dence of the disease. The role of chance is related to biological variability and the influence of sam -
ple size on the precision of estimates of effect.
In evaluating the extent to which these fac -
tors have been minimized in an individual study, consideration is given to several aspects of design 
and analysis as described in the report of the 
study. For example, when suspicion of carcino -
genicity arises largely from a single small study, 
careful consideration is given when interpreting 
subsequent studies that included these data in an enlarged population. Most of these considera -
tions apply equally to case–control, cohort and correlation studies. Lack of clarity of any of these aspects in the reporting of a study can decrease 
its credibility and the weight given to it in the 
final evaluation of the exposure.
First, the study population, disease (or dis -
eases) and exposure should have been well defined by the authors. Cases of disease in the study population should have been identified in 
a way that was independent of the exposure of 
interest, and exposure should have been assessed in a way that was not related to disease status.
Second, the authors should have taken into 
account — in the study design and analysis — other variables that can influence the risk of dis -
ease and may have been related to the exposure of interest. Potential confounding by such vari -
ables should have been dealt with either in the 
design of the study, such as by matching, or in 
the analysis, by statistical adjustment. In cohort studies, comparisons with local rates of disease 
may or may not be more appropriate than those 
with national rates. Internal comparisons of 
17IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
frequency of disease among individuals at differ -
ent levels of exposure are also desirable in cohort 
studies, since they minimize the potential for 
confounding related to the difference in risk fac -
tors between an external reference group and the 
study population.
Third, the authors should have reported the 
basic data on which the conclusions are founded, even if sophisticated statistical analyses were 
employed. At the very least, they should have given the numbers of exposed and unexposed 
cases and controls in a case–control study and 
the numbers of cases observed and expected in a cohort study. Further tabulations by time since 
exposure began and other temporal factors are 
also important. In a cohort study, data on all cancer sites and all causes of death should have 
been given, to reveal the possibility of reporting 
bias. In a case–control study, the effects of inves -
tigated factors other than the exposure of interest 
should have been reported.
Finally, the statistical methods used to obtain 
estimates of relative risk, absolute rates of can -
cer, confidence intervals and significance tests, 
and to adjust for confounding should have been clearly stated by the authors. These methods have 
been reviewed for case–control studies ( Breslow 
& Day, 1980 ) and for cohort studies ( Breslow & 
Day, 1987 ).
(c) Meta-analyses and pooled analyses
Independent epidemiological studies of the 
same agent may lead to results that are difficult to interpret. Combined analyses of data from 
multiple studies are a means of resolving this ambiguity, and well conducted analyses can be 
considered. There are two types of combined 
analysis. The first involves combining summary statistics such as relative risks from individual 
studies (meta-analysis) and the second involves a 
pooled analysis of the raw data from the individ -
ual studies (pooled analysis) ( Greenland, 1998 ).The advantages of combined analyses are 
increased precision due to increased sample size and the opportunity to explore potential con -
founders, interactions and modifying effects that may explain heterogeneity among studies in more detail. A disadvantage of combined analy -
ses is the possible lack of compatibility of data from various studies due to differences in sub -
ject recruitment, procedures of data collection, 
methods of measurement and effects of unmeas -
ured co-variates that may differ among studies. 
Despite these limitations, well conducted com -
bined analyses may provide a firmer basis than individual studies for drawing conclusions about the potential carcinogenicity of agents.
IARC may commission a meta-analysis or 
pooled analysis that is pertinent to a particular Monograph  (see Part A, Section 4). Additionally, 
as a means of gaining insight from the results of multiple individual studies, ad hoc calculations that combine data from different studies may 
be conducted by the Working Group during 
the course of a Monograph  meeting. The results 
of such original calculations, which would be 
specified in the text by presentation in square 
brackets, might involve updates of previously conducted analyses that incorporate the results 
of more recent studies or de-novo analyses. 
Irrespective of the source of data for the meta-analyses and pooled analyses, it is important that 
the same criteria for data quality be applied as 
those that would be applied to individual studies and to ensure also that sources of heterogeneity 
between studies be taken into account.
(d) Temporal effects
Detailed analyses of both relative and abso -
lute risks in relation to temporal variables, such as age at first exposure, time since first exposure, 
duration of exposure, cumulative exposure, peak exposure (when appropriate) and time since 
cessation of exposure, are reviewed and sum -
marized when available. Analyses of temporal 
18Preamble
relationships may be useful in making causal 
inferences. In addition, such analyses may sug -
gest whether a carcinogen acts early or late in the process of carcinogenesis, although, at best, they allow only indirect inferences about mechanisms 
of carcinogenesis.
(e) Use of biomarkers in epidemiological 
studies
Biomarkers indicate molecular, cellular or 
other biological changes and are increasingly 
used in epidemiological studies for various pur -
poses ( IARC, 1991 ; Vainio et al ., 1992 ; Toniolo 
et al., 1997 ; Vineis et al., 1999 ; Buffler et al., 2004 ). 
These may include evidence of exposure, of early 
effects, of cellular, tissue or organism responses, of individual susceptibility or host responses, 
and inference of a mechanism (see Part B, Section 
4b). This is a rapidly evolving field that encom -
passes developments in genomics, epigenomics 
and other emerging technologies.
Molecular epidemiological data that identify 
associations between genetic polymorphisms and interindividual differences in susceptibility 
to the agent(s) being evaluated may contribute to the identification of carcinogenic hazards to 
humans. If the polymorphism has been demon -
strated experimentally to modify the functional 
activity of the gene product in a manner that is 
consistent with increased susceptibility, these 
data may be useful in making causal inferences. Similarly, molecular epidemiological studies that 
measure cell functions, enzymes or metabolites 
that are thought to be the basis of susceptibil -
ity may provide evidence that reinforces biologi -
cal plausibility. It should be noted, however, that when data on genetic susceptibility originate from multiple comparisons that arise from sub -
group analyses, this can generate false-positive results and inconsistencies across studies, and such data therefore require careful evaluation. 
If the known phenotype of a genetic polymor -
phism can explain the carcinogenic mechanism of the agent being evaluated, data on this pheno -
type may be useful in making causal inferences.
(f) Criteria for causality
After the quality of individual epidemiologi -
cal studies of cancer has been summarized and assessed, a judgement is made concerning the 
strength of evidence that the agent in question is carcinogenic to humans. In making its judge -
ment, the Working Group considers several crite -
ria for causality ( Hill, 1965 ). A strong association  
(e.g. a large relative risk) is more likely to indicate 
causality than a weak association, although it is 
recognized that estimates of effect of small mag -
nitude do not imply lack of causality and may be 
important if the disease or exposure is common. 
Associations that are replicated in several studies of the same design or that use different epidemi -
ological approaches or under different circum -
stances of exposure are more likely to represent a causal relationship than isolated observations 
from single studies. If there are inconsistent 
results among investigations, possible reasons are sought (such as differences in exposure), and 
results of studies that are judged to be of high 
quality are given more weight than those of stud -
ies that are judged to be methodologically less 
sound.
If the risk increases with the exposure, this is 
considered to be a strong indication of causality, although the absence of a graded response is not 
necessarily evidence against a causal relation -
ship. The demonstration of a decline in risk after 
cessation of or reduction in exposure in indi -
viduals or in whole populations also supports a 
causal interpretation of the findings.
Several scenarios may increase confidence in 
a causal relationship. On the one hand, an agent may be specific in causing tumours at one site or 
of one morphological type. On the other, carci -
nogenicity may be evident through the causation 
of multiple tumour types. Temporality, precision 
of estimates of effect, biological plausibility and 
19IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
coherence of the overall database are consid -
ered. Data on biomarkers may be employed in 
an assessment of the biological plausibility of epi -
demiological observations.
Although rarely available, results from rand -
omized trials that show different rates of cancer 
among exposed and unexposed individuals pro -
vide particularly strong evidence for causality.
When several epidemiological studies show 
little or no indication of an association between an exposure and cancer, a judgement may be made 
that, in the aggregate, they show evidence of lack 
of carcinogenicity. Such a judgement requires first that the studies meet, to a sufficient degree, 
the standards of design and analysis described 
above. Specifically, the possibility that bias, con -
founding or misclassification of exposure or out -
come could explain the observed results should be considered and excluded with reasonable cer -
tainty. In addition, all studies that are judged to 
be methodologically sound should (a) be con -
sistent with an estimate of effect of unity for any 
observed level of exposure, (b) when considered 
together, provide a pooled estimate of relative 
risk that is at or near to unity, and (c) have a nar -
row confidence interval, due to sufficient popula -
tion size. Moreover, no individual study nor the pooled results of all the studies should show any consistent tendency that the relative risk of can -
cer increases with increasing level of exposure. It is important to note that evidence of lack of carcinogenicity obtained from several epidemio -
logical studies can apply only to the type(s) of cancer studied, to the dose levels reported, and to the intervals between first exposure and disease 
onset observed in these studies. Experience with 
human cancer indicates that the period from first exposure to the development of clinical cancer is 
sometimes longer than 20 years; latent periods 
substantially shorter than 30 years cannot pro -
vide evidence for lack of carcinogenicity.3. Studies of cancer in experimental 
animals
All known human carcinogens that have been 
studied adequately for carcinogenicity in experi -
mental animals have produced positive results 
in one or more animal species ( Wilbourn et al ., 
1986 ; Tomatis et al ., 1989 ). For several agents 
(e.g. aflatoxins, diethylstilbestrol, solar radiation, vinyl chloride), carcinogenicity in experimen -
tal animals was established or highly suspected 
before epidemiological studies confirmed their 
carcinogenicity in humans ( Vainio et al ., 1995 ). 
Although this association cannot establish that 
all agents that cause cancer in experimental ani -
mals also cause cancer in humans, it is biologically 
plausible that agents for which there is sufficient 
evidence of carcinogenicity  in experimental ani -
mals (see Part B, Section 6b) also present a car -
cinogenic hazard to humans. Accordingly, in the absence of additional scientific information, 
these agents are considered to pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans. Examples of additional scien -
tific information are data that demonstrate that a given agent causes cancer in animals through a species-specific mechanism that does not oper -
ate in humans or data that demonstrate that the mechanism in experimental animals also oper -
ates in humans (see Part B, Section 6).
Consideration is given to all available long-
term studies of cancer in experimental animals with the agent under review (see Part A, Section 
4). In all experimental settings, the nature and 
extent of impurities or contaminants present in the agent being evaluated are given when avail -
able. Animal species, strain (including genetic background where applicable), sex, numbers per group, age at start of treatment, route of expo -
sure, dose levels, duration of exposure, survival and information on tumours (incidence, latency, severity or multiplicity of neoplasms or prene -
oplastic lesions) are reported. Those studies in experimental animals that are judged to be irrel -
evant to the evaluation or judged to be inadequate 
20Preamble
(e.g. too short a duration, too few animals, poor 
survival; see below) may be omitted. Guidelines 
for conducting long-term carcinogenicity exper -
iments have been published (e.g. OECD, 2002 ).
Other studies considered may include: exper -
iments in which the agent was administered in 
the presence of factors that modify carcinogenic effects (e.g. initiation–promotion studies, co-
carcinogenicity studies and studies in geneti -
cally modified animals); studies in which the 
end-point was not cancer but a defined precan -
cerous lesion; experiments on the carcinogenic -
ity of known metabolites and derivatives; and studies of cancer in non-laboratory animals (e.g. 
livestock and companion animals) exposed to 
the agent.
For studies of mixtures, consideration is 
given to the possibility that changes in the phys -
icochemical properties of the individual sub -
stances may occur during collection, storage, 
extraction, concentration and delivery. Another 
consideration is that chemical and toxicological interactions of components in a mixture may 
alter dose–response relationships. The relevance 
to human exposure of the test mixture adminis -
tered in the animal experiment is also assessed. 
This may involve consideration of the following 
aspects of the mixture tested: (i) physical and chemical characteristics, (ii) identified constitu -
ents that may indicate the presence of a class of substances and (iii) the results of genetic toxicity and related tests.
The relevance of results obtained with an 
agent that is analogous (e.g. similar in structure or of a similar virus genus) to that being evalu -
ated is also considered. Such results may provide biological and mechanistic information that is relevant to the understanding of the process of 
carcinogenesis in humans and may strengthen 
the biological plausibility that the agent being evaluated is carcinogenic to humans (see Part B, 
Section 2f).(a) Qualitative aspects
An assessment of carcinogenicity involves 
several considerations of qualitative impor -
tance, including (i) the experimental conditions 
under which the test was performed, including route, schedule and duration of exposure, spe -
cies, strain (including genetic background where applicable), sex, age and duration of follow-up; (ii) the consistency of the results, for example, 
across species and target organ(s); (iii) the spec -
trum of neoplastic response, from preneoplastic 
lesions and benign tumours to malignant neo -
plasms; and (iv) the possible role of modifying factors.
Considerations of importance in the inter -
pretation and evaluation of a particular study include: (i) how clearly the agent was defined and, in the case of mixtures, how adequately the sam -
ple characterization was reported; (ii) whether the dose was monitored adequately, particu -
larly in inhalation experiments; (iii) whether the 
doses, duration of treatment and route of expo -
sure were appropriate; (iv) whether the survival 
of treated animals was similar to that of con -
trols; (v) whether there were adequate numbers of animals per group; (vi) whether both male and female animals were used; (vii) whether animals 
were allocated randomly to groups; (viii) whether 
the duration of observation was adequate; and (ix) whether the data were reported and analysed 
adequately.
When benign tumours (a) occur together 
with and originate from the same cell type as malignant tumours in an organ or tissue in a 
particular study and (b) appear to represent a stage in the progression to malignancy, they are 
usually combined in the assessment of tumour 
incidence ( Huff et al ., 1989 ). The occurrence of 
lesions presumed to be preneoplastic may in cer -
tain instances aid in assessing the biological plau -
sibility of any neoplastic response observed. If an agent induces only benign neoplasms that appear 
to be end-points that do not readily undergo 
21IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
transition to malignancy, the agent should nev -
ertheless be suspected of being carcinogenic and 
requires further investigation.
(b) Quantitative aspects
The probability that tumours will occur may 
depend on the species, sex, strain, genetic back -
ground and age of the animal, and on the dose, 
route, timing and duration of the exposure. Evidence of an increased incidence of neoplasms 
with increasing levels of exposure strengthens 
the inference of a causal association between the exposure and the development of neoplasms.
The form of the dose–response relation -
ship can vary widely, depending on the par -
ticular agent under study and the target organ. 
Mechanisms such as induction of DNA dam -
age or inhibition of repair, altered cell division 
and cell death rates and changes in intercellular communication are important determinants of 
dose–response relationships for some carcino -
gens. Since many chemicals require metabolic 
activation before being converted to their reac -
tive intermediates, both metabolic and toxicoki -
netic aspects are important in determining the dose–response pattern. Saturation of steps such 
as absorption, activation, inactivation and elim -
ination may produce nonlinearity in the dose–
response relationship ( Hoel et al.,  1983 ; Gart 
et al., 1986 ), as could saturation of processes such 
as DNA repair. The dose–response relationship can also be affected by differences in survival 
among the treatment groups.
(c) Statistical analyses
Factors considered include the adequacy of 
the information given for each treatment group: (i) number of animals studied and number exam -
ined histologically, (ii) number of animals with a 
given tumour type and (iii) length of survival. 
The statistical methods used should be clearly 
stated and should be the generally accepted tech -
niques refined for this purpose ( Peto et al., 1980 ; Gart et al ., 1986 ; Portier & Bailer, 1989 ; Bieler & 
Williams, 1993 ). The choice of the most appro -
priate statistical method requires consideration of whether or not there are differences in sur -
vival among the treatment groups; for example, 
reduced survival because of non-tumour-related 
mortality can preclude the occurrence of tumours later in life. When detailed informa -
tion on survival is not available, comparisons of the proportions of tumour-bearing animals among the effective number of animals (alive at 
the time the first tumour was discovered) can 
be useful when significant differences in sur -
vival occur before tumours appear. The lethal -
ity of the tumour also requires consideration: for rapidly fatal tumours, the time of death provides an indication of the time of tumour onset and 
can be assessed using life-table methods; non-
fatal or incidental tumours that do not affect survival can be assessed using methods such as 
the Mantel-Haenzel test for changes in tumour 
prevalence. Because tumour lethality is often dif -
ficult to determine, methods such as the Poly-K 
test that do not require such information can 
also be used. When results are available on the number and size of tumours seen in experimen -
tal animals (e.g. papillomas on mouse skin, liver tumours observed through nuclear magnetic resonance tomography), other more complicated 
statistical procedures may be needed ( Sherman 
et al., 1994 ; Dunson et al., 2003 ).
Formal statistical methods have been devel -
oped to incorporate historical control data into 
the analysis of data from a given experiment. These methods assign an appropriate weight to 
historical and concurrent controls on the basis 
of the extent of between-study and within-study variability: less weight is given to historical con -
trols when they show a high degree of variability, and greater weight when they show little varia -
bility. It is generally not appropriate to discount 
a tumour response that is significantly increased 
compared with concurrent controls by arguing that it falls within the range of historical controls, 
22Preamble
particularly when historical controls show high 
between-study variability and are, thus, of little 
relevance to the current experiment. In analys -
ing results for uncommon tumours, however, the 
analysis may be improved by considering histori -
cal control data, particularly when between-study variability is low. Historical controls should be selected to resemble the concurrent controls as 
closely as possible with respect to species, gen -
der and strain, as well as other factors such as 
basal diet and general laboratory environment, 
which may affect tumour-response rates in con -
trol animals ( Haseman et al ., 1984 ; Fung et al. , 
1996 ; Greim et al., 2003 ).
Although meta-analyses and combined anal -
yses are conducted less frequently for animal 
experiments than for epidemiological studies 
due to differences in animal strains, they can be 
useful aids in interpreting animal data when the experimental protocols are sufficiently similar.
4. Mechanistic and other relevant 
data
Mechanistic and other relevant data may pro -
vide evidence of carcinogenicity and also help in 
assessing the relevance and importance of find -
ings of cancer in animals and in humans. The 
nature of the mechanistic and other relevant data 
depends on the biological activity of the agent 
being considered. The Working Group considers representative studies to give a concise descrip -
tion of the relevant data and issues that they con -
sider to be important; thus, not every available study is cited. Relevant topics may include toxi -
cokinetics, mechanisms of carcinogenesis, sus -
ceptible individuals, populations and life-stages, other relevant data and other adverse effects. 
When data on biomarkers are informative about 
the mechanisms of carcinogenesis, they are included in this section.
These topics are not mutually exclusive; thus, 
the same studies may be discussed in more than one subsection. For example, a mutation in a gene that codes for an enzyme that metabolizes the agent under study could be discussed in the 
subsections on toxicokinetics, mechanisms and 
individual susceptibility if it also exists as an inherited polymorphism.
(a) Toxicokinetic data
Toxicokinetics refers to the absorption, dis -
tribution, metabolism and elimination of agents 
in humans, experimental animals and, where 
relevant, cellular systems. Examples of kinetic factors that may affect dose–response relation -
ships include uptake, deposition, biopersis -
tence and half-life in tissues, protein binding, metabolic activation and detoxification. Studies 
that indicate the metabolic fate of the agent in 
humans and in experimental animals are sum -
marized briefly, and comparisons of data from 
humans and animals are made when possible. 
Comparative information on the relationship between exposure and the dose that reaches the 
target site may be important for the extrapola -
tion of hazards between species and in clarifying 
the role of in-vitro findings.
(b) Data on mechanisms of carcinogenesis
To provide focus, the Working Group 
attempts to identify the possible mechanisms by 
which the agent may increase the risk of cancer. 
For each possible mechanism, a representative selection of key data from humans and experi -
mental systems is summarized. Attention is given to gaps in the data and to data that suggests that more than one mechanism may be operat -
ing. The relevance of the mechanism to humans is discussed, in particular, when mechanistic data are derived from experimental model sys -
tems. Changes in the affected organs, tissues or cells can be divided into three non-exclusive lev -
els as described below.
23IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
(i) Changes in physiology
Physiological changes refer to exposure-
related modifications to the physiology and/or 
response of cells, tissues and organs. Examples 
of potentially adverse physiological changes 
include mitogenesis, compensatory cell division, escape from apoptosis and/or senescence, pres -
ence of inflammation, hyperplasia, metaplasia and/or preneoplasia, angiogenesis, alterations in cellular adhesion, changes in steroidal hormones 
and changes in immune surveillance.
(ii) Functional changes at the cellular level
Functional changes refer to exposure-related 
alterations in the signalling pathways used by 
cells to manage critical processes that are related to increased risk for cancer. Examples of func -
tional changes include modified activities of enzymes involved in the metabolism of xenobi -
otics, alterations in the expression of key genes 
that regulate DNA repair, alterations in cyclin-
dependent kinases that govern cell cycle progres -
sion, changes in the patterns of post-translational 
modifications of proteins, changes in regula -
tory factors that alter apoptotic rates, changes 
in the secretion of factors related to the stimula -
tion of DNA replication and transcription and changes in gap–junction-mediated intercellular communication.
(iii) Changes at the molecular level
Molecular changes refer to exposure-related 
changes in key cellular structures at the molec -
ular level, including, in particular, genotoxicity. 
Examples of molecular changes include forma -
tion of DNA adducts and DNA strand breaks, 
mutations in genes, chromosomal aberrations, 
aneuploidy and changes in DNA methylation patterns. Greater emphasis is given to irrevers -
ible effects.
The use of mechanistic data in the identifica -
tion of a carcinogenic hazard is specific to the 
mechanism being addressed and is not readily described for every possible level and mechanism 
discussed above.
Genotoxicity data are discussed here to illus -
trate the key issues involved in the evaluation of mechanistic data.
Tests for genetic and related effects are 
described in view of the relevance of gene muta -
tion and chromosomal aberration/aneuploidy 
to carcinogenesis ( Vainio et al ., 1992 ; McGregor 
et al. , 1999 ). The adequacy of the reporting of 
sample characterization is considered and, when necessary, commented upon; with regard to 
complex mixtures, such comments are similar to those described for animal carcinogenicity 
tests. The available data are interpreted critically 
according to the end-points detected, which may include DNA damage, gene mutation, sister 
chromatid exchange, micronucleus formation, 
chromosomal aberrations and aneuploidy. The concentrations employed are given, and men -
tion is made of whether the use of an exogenous metabolic system in vitro affected the test result. These data are listed in tabular form by phyloge -
netic classification.
Positive results in tests using prokary -
otes, lower eukaryotes, insects, plants and cul -
tured mammalian cells suggest that genetic and related effects could occur in mammals. Results from such tests may also give information on 
the types of genetic effect produced and on the 
involvement of metabolic activation. Some end-points described are clearly genetic in nature 
(e.g. gene mutations), while others are associated 
with genetic effects (e.g. unscheduled DNA syn -
thesis). In-vitro tests for tumour promotion, cell 
transformation and gap–junction intercellular 
communication may be sensitive to changes that are not necessarily the result of genetic altera -
tions but that may have specific relevance to the process of carcinogenesis. Critical appraisals of these tests have been published ( Montesano 
et al., 1986 ; McGregor et al., 1999 ).
Genetic or other activity manifest in humans 
and experimental mammals is regarded to be of 
24Preamble
greater relevance than that in other organisms. 
The demonstration that an agent can induce 
gene and chromosomal mutations in mammals 
in vivo indicates that it may have carcinogenic activity. Negative results in tests for mutagenicity 
in selected tissues from animals treated in vivo 
provide less weight, partly because they do not exclude the possibility of an effect in tissues other 
than those examined. Moreover, negative results 
in short-term tests with genetic end-points can -
not be considered to provide evidence that rules 
out the carcinogenicity of agents that act through 
other mechanisms (e.g. receptor-mediated effects, cellular toxicity with regenerative cell 
division, peroxisome proliferation) ( Vainio et al., 
1992 ). Factors that may give misleading results 
in short-term tests have been discussed in detail elsewhere ( Montesano et al ., 1986 ; McGregor 
et al., 1999 ).
When there is evidence that an agent acts by 
a specific mechanism that does not involve gen -
otoxicity (e.g. hormonal dysregulation, immune 
suppression, and formation of calculi and other 
deposits that cause chronic irritation), that evi -
dence is presented and reviewed critically in the 
context of rigorous criteria for the operation of 
that mechanism in carcinogenesis (e.g. Capen 
et al., 1999 ).
For biological agents such as viruses, bacteria 
and parasites, other data relevant to carcinogenic -
ity may include descriptions of the pathology of infection, integration and expression of viruses, 
and genetic alterations seen in human tumours. 
Other observations that might comprise cellu -
lar and tissue responses to infection, immune 
response and the presence of tumour markers 
are also considered.
For physical agents that are forms of radia -
tion, other data relevant to carcinogenicity may include descriptions of damaging effects at the physiological, cellular and molecular level, as 
for chemical agents, and descriptions of how 
these effects occur. ‘Physical agents’ may also be considered to comprise foreign bodies, such as surgical implants of various kinds, and poorly soluble fibres, dusts and particles of various 
sizes, the pathogenic effects of which are a result 
of their physical presence in tissues or body cavities. Other relevant data for such materials 
may include characterization of cellular, tissue 
and physiological reactions to these materi -
als and descriptions of pathological conditions 
other than neoplasia with which they may be 
associated.
(c) Other data relevant to mechanisms
A description is provided of any structure–
activity relationships that may be relevant to an 
evaluation of the carcinogenicity of an agent, the 
toxicological implications of the physical and chemical properties, and any other data relevant 
to the evaluation that are not included elsewhere.
High-output data, such as those derived from 
gene expression microarrays, and high-through -
put data, such as those that result from testing 
hundreds of agents for a single end-point, pose a unique problem for the use of mechanistic data 
in the evaluation of a carcinogenic hazard. In 
the case of high-output data, there is the possi -
bility to overinterpret changes in individual end-
points (e.g. changes in expression in one gene) 
without considering the consistency of that find -
ing in the broader context of the other end-points 
(e.g. other genes with linked transcriptional con -
trol). High-output data can be used in assessing 
mechanisms, but all end-points measured in a 
single experiment need to be considered in the 
proper context. For high-throughput data, where the number of observations far exceeds the num -
ber of end-points measured, their utility for iden -
tifying common mechanisms across multiple agents is enhanced. These data can be used to 
identify mechanisms that not only seem plausi -
ble, but also have a consistent pattern of carci -
nogenic response across entire classes of related compounds.
25IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
(d) Susceptibility data
Individuals, populations and life-stages may 
have greater or lesser susceptibility to an agent, 
based on toxicokinetics, mechanisms of carcino -
genesis and other factors. Examples of host and 
genetic factors that affect individual susceptibil -
ity include sex, genetic polymorphisms of genes involved in the metabolism of the agent under evaluation, differences in metabolic capacity due 
to life-stage or the presence of disease, differ -
ences in DNA repair capacity, competition for 
or alteration of metabolic capacity by medica -
tions or other chemical exposures, pre-existing hormonal imbalance that is exacerbated by a chemical exposure, a suppressed immune sys -
tem, periods of higher-than-usual tissue growth or regeneration and genetic polymorphisms that lead to differences in behaviour (e.g. addiction). 
Such data can substantially increase the strength 
of the evidence from epidemiological data and enhance the linkage of in-vivo and in-vitro labo -
ratory studies to humans.
(e) Data on other adverse effects
Data on acute, subchronic and chronic 
adverse effects relevant to the cancer evaluation 
are summarized. Adverse effects that confirm 
distribution and biological effects at the sites of tumour development, or alterations in physiol -
ogy that could lead to tumour development, are emphasized. Effects on reproduction, embryonic and fetal survival and development are summa -
rized briefly. The adequacy of epidemiological studies of reproductive outcome and genetic and related effects in humans is judged by the same 
criteria as those applied to epidemiological stud -
ies of cancer, but fewer details are given.
5. Summary
This section is a summary of data presented 
in the preceding sections. Summaries can be found on the Monographs  programme web site 
(http://monographs.iarc.fr).
(a) Exposure data
Data are summarized, as appropriate, on the 
basis of elements such as production, use, occur -
rence and exposure levels in the workplace and 
environment and measurements in human tis -
sues and body fluids. Quantitative data and time 
trends are given to compare exposures in dif -
ferent occupations and environmental settings. 
Exposure to biological agents is described in terms of transmission, prevalence and persis -
tence of infection.
(b) Cancer in humans
Results of epidemiological studies pertinent 
to an assessment of human carcinogenicity are 
summarized. When relevant, case reports and 
correlation studies are also summarized. The tar -
get organ(s) or tissue(s) in which an increase in cancer was observed is identified. Dose–response and other quantitative data may be summarized 
when available.
(c) Cancer in experimental animals
Data relevant to an evaluation of carcino -
genicity in animals are summarized. For each animal species, study design and route of admin -
istration, it is stated whether an increased inci -
dence, reduced latency, or increased severity or multiplicity of neoplasms or preneoplastic 
lesions were observed, and the tumour sites are indicated. If the agent produced tumours after 
prenatal exposure or in single-dose experiments, 
this is also mentioned. Negative findings, inverse relationships, dose–response and other quantita -
tive data are also summarized.
(d) Mechanistic and other relevant data
Data relevant to the toxicokinetics (absorp -
tion, distribution, metabolism, elimination) and 
26Preamble
the possible mechanism(s) of carcinogenesis (e.g. 
genetic toxicity, epigenetic effects) are summa -
rized. In addition, information on susceptible individuals, populations and life-stages is sum -
marized. This section also reports on other toxic 
effects, including reproductive and developmen -
tal effects, as well as additional relevant data that 
are considered to be important.
6. Evaluation and rationale
Evaluations of the strength of the evidence for 
carcinogenicity arising from human and experi -
mental animal data are made, using standard terms. The strength of the mechanistic evidence is also characterized.
It is recognized that the criteria for these 
evaluations, described below, cannot encompass all of the factors that may be relevant to an eval -
uation of carcinogenicity. In considering all of the relevant scientific data, the Working Group may assign the agent to a higher or lower cat -
egory than a strict interpretation of these criteria would indicate.
These categories refer only to the strength of 
the evidence that an exposure is carcinogenic and not to the extent of its carcinogenic activ -
ity (potency). A classification may change as new 
information becomes available.
An evaluation of the degree of evidence is lim -
ited to the materials tested, as defined physically, chemically or biologically. When the agents eval -
uated are considered by the Working Group to be 
sufficiently closely related, they may be grouped 
together for the purpose of a single evaluation of 
the degree of evidence.
(a) Carcinogenicity in humans
The evidence relevant to carcinogenicity from 
studies in humans is classified into one of the fol -
lowing categories:
Sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity: 
The Working Group considers that a causal relationship has been established between expo -
sure to the agent and human cancer. That is, a 
positive relationship has been observed between 
the exposure and cancer in studies in which chance, bias and confounding could be ruled 
out with reasonable confidence. A statement that 
there is sufficient evidence  is followed by a sepa -
rate sentence that identifies the target organ(s) or 
tissue(s) where an increased risk of cancer was 
observed in humans. Identification of a specific target organ or tissue does not preclude the pos -
sibility that the agent may cause cancer at other sites.
Limited evidence of carcinogenicity :  
A positive association has been observed between exposure to the agent and cancer for which a causal interpretation is considered by 
the Working Group to be credible, but chance, 
bias or confounding could not be ruled out with reasonable confidence.
Inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity : The 
available studies are of insufficient quality, con -
sistency or statistical power to permit a conclu -
sion regarding the presence or absence of a causal association between exposure and cancer, or no data on cancer in humans are available.
Evidence suggesting lack of carcinogenicity : 
There are several adequate studies covering the full range of levels of exposure that humans are 
known to encounter, which are mutually consist -
ent in not showing a positive association between 
exposure to the agent and any studied cancer 
at any observed level of exposure. The results 
from these studies alone or combined should have narrow confidence intervals with an upper 
limit close to the null value (e.g. a relative risk 
of 1.0). Bias and confounding should be ruled out with reasonable confidence, and the studies 
should have an adequate length of follow-up. A 
conclusion of evidence suggesting lack of carcino -
genicity  is inevitably limited to the cancer sites, 
conditions and levels of exposure, and length of observation covered by the available studies. In 
27IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
addition, the possibility of a very small risk at the 
levels of exposure studied can never be excluded.
In some instances, the above categories may 
be used to classify the degree of evidence related to carcinogenicity in specific organs or tissues.
When the available epidemiological stud -
ies pertain to a mixture, process, occupation or industry, the Working Group seeks to identify 
the specific agent considered most likely to be 
responsible for any excess risk. The evaluation is focused as narrowly as the available data on 
exposure and other aspects permit.
(b) Carcinogenicity in experimental 
animals
Carcinogenicity in experimental animals can 
be evaluated using conventional bioassays, bioas -
says that employ genetically modified animals, 
and other in-vivo bioassays that focus on one or more of the critical stages of carcinogenesis. In 
the absence of data from conventional long-term 
bioassays or from assays with neoplasia as the end-point, consistently positive results in several 
models that address several stages in the multi -
stage process of carcinogenesis should be con -
sidered in evaluating the degree of evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals.
The evidence relevant to carcinogenicity in 
experimental animals is classified into one of the following categories:
Sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity:  The 
Working Group considers that a causal relation -
ship has been established between the agent and 
an increased incidence of malignant neoplasms or of an appropriate combination of benign and 
malignant neoplasms in (a) two or more species 
of animals or (b) two or more independent stud -
ies in one species carried out at different times 
or in different laboratories or under different 
protocols. An increased incidence of tumours in both sexes of a single species in a well conducted 
study, ideally conducted under Good Laboratory 
Practices, can also provide sufficient evidence .A single study in one species and sex might be 
considered to provide sufficient evidence of carci -
nogenicity  when malignant neoplasms occur to 
an unusual degree with regard to incidence, site, 
type of tumour or age at onset, or when there are 
strong findings of tumours at multiple sites.
Limited evidence of carcinogenicity :  
The data suggest a carcinogenic effect but are limited for making a definitive evaluation because, e.g. (a) the evidence of carcinogenicity 
is restricted to a single experiment; (b) there are 
unresolved questions regarding the adequacy of the design, conduct or interpretation of the stud -
ies; (c) the agent increases the incidence only of benign neoplasms or lesions of uncertain neo -
plastic potential; or (d) the evidence of carcino -
genicity is restricted to studies that demonstrate only promoting activity in a narrow range of tis -
sues or organs.
Inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity :  
The studies cannot be interpreted as showing either the presence or absence of a carcinogenic 
effect because of major qualitative or quantitative 
limitations, or no data on cancer in experimental animals are available.
Evidence suggesting lack of carcinogenicity : 
Adequate studies involving at least two species are available which show that, within the limits 
of the tests used, the agent is not carcinogenic. 
A conclusion of evidence suggesting lack of car -
cinogenicity  is inevitably limited to the species, 
tumour sites, age at exposure, and conditions and levels of exposure studied.
(c) Mechanistic and other relevant data
Mechanistic and other evidence judged to 
be relevant to an evaluation of carcinogenicity 
and of sufficient importance to affect the over -
all evaluation is highlighted. This may include 
data on preneoplastic lesions, tumour pathol -
ogy, genetic and related effects, structure–activ -
ity relationships, metabolism and toxicokinetics, 
28Preamble
physicochemical parameters and analogous bio -
logical agents.
The strength of the evidence that any carcino -
genic effect observed is due to a particular mech -
anism is evaluated, using terms such as ‘weak’, 
‘moderate’ or ‘strong’. The Working Group then 
assesses whether that particular mechanism is likely to be operative in humans. The strongest 
indications that a particular mechanism oper -
ates in humans derive from data on humans 
or biological specimens obtained from exposed 
humans. The data may be considered to be espe -
cially relevant if they show that the agent in ques -
tion has caused changes in exposed humans that are on the causal pathway to carcinogenesis. 
Such data may, however, never become available, because it is at least conceivable that certain com -
pounds may be kept from human use solely on the basis of evidence of their toxicity and/or car -
cinogenicity in experimental systems.
The conclusion that a mechanism operates in 
experimental animals is strengthened by find -
ings of consistent results in different experimen -
tal systems, by the demonstration of biological plausibility and by coherence of the overall data -
base. Strong support can be obtained from stud -
ies that challenge the hypothesized mechanism experimentally, by demonstrating that the sup -
pression of key mechanistic processes leads to 
the suppression of tumour development. The 
Working Group considers whether multiple mechanisms might contribute to tumour devel -
opment, whether different mechanisms might operate in different dose ranges, whether sepa -
rate mechanisms might operate in humans and 
experimental animals and whether a unique 
mechanism might operate in a susceptible group. The possible contribution of alternative mecha -
nisms must be considered before concluding that tumours observed in experimental animals are not relevant to humans. An uneven level of 
experimental support for different mechanisms 
may reflect that disproportionate resources have been focused on investigating a favoured mechanism.
For complex exposures, including occupa -
tional and industrial exposures, the chemical composition and the potential contribution of 
carcinogens known to be present are considered 
by the Working Group in its overall evaluation of human carcinogenicity. The Working Group 
also determines the extent to which the materi -
als tested in experimental systems are related to 
those to which humans are exposed.
(d) Overall evaluation
Finally, the body of evidence is considered as 
a whole, to reach an overall evaluation of the car -
cinogenicity of the agent to humans.
An evaluation may be made for a group of 
agents that have been evaluated by the Working 
Group. In addition, when supporting data indi -
cate that other related agents, for which there is 
no direct evidence of their capacity to induce 
cancer in humans or in animals, may also be 
carcinogenic, a statement describing the ration -
ale for this conclusion is added to the evaluation 
narrative; an additional evaluation may be made 
for this broader group of agents if the strength of the evidence warrants it.
The agent is described according to the word -
ing of one of the following categories, and the designated group is given. The categorization of 
an agent is a matter of scientific judgement that 
reflects the strength of the evidence derived from studies in humans and in experimental animals 
and from mechanistic and other relevant data.
Group 1: The agent is carcinogenic to 
humans.
This category is used when there is suffi -
cient evidence of carcinogenicity  in humans. 
Exceptionally, an agent may be placed in this 
category when evidence of carcinogenicity in 
humans is less than sufficient  but there is suffi -
cient evidence of carcinogenicity  in experimental 
29IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
animals and strong evidence in exposed humans 
that the agent acts through a relevant mechanism 
of carcinogenicity.
Group 2.
This category includes agents for which, at 
one extreme, the degree of evidence of carcino -
genicity in humans is almost sufficient , as well as 
those for which, at the other extreme, there are 
no human data but for which there is evidence of 
carcinogenicity in experimental animals. Agents are assigned to either Group 2A ( probably car -
cinogenic to humans ) or Group 2B ( possibly 
carcinogenic to humans ) on the basis of epide -
miological and experimental evidence of carci -
nogenicity and mechanistic and other relevant data. The terms probably carcinogenic  and possi -
bly carcinogenic  have no quantitative significance 
and are used simply as descriptors of different levels of evidence of human carcinogenicity, with probably carcinogenic  signifying a higher level of 
evidence than possibly carcinogenic .
Group 2A: The agent is probably 
carcinogenic to humans.
This category is used when there is limited 
evidence of carcinogenicity  in humans and suffi -
cient evidence of carcinogenicity  in experimental 
animals. In some cases, an agent may be classi -
fied in this category when there is inadequate evi-dence of carcinogenicity  in humans and sufficient 
evidence of carcinogenicity  in experimental ani -
mals and strong evidence that the carcinogenesis is mediated by a mechanism that also operates 
in humans. Exceptionally, an agent may be clas -
sified in this category solely on the basis of lim -
ited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans. An agent may be assigned to this category if it clearly 
belongs, based on mechanistic considerations, to a class of agents for which one or more members 
have been classified in Group 1 or Group 2A.Group 2B: The agent is possibly carcinogenic 
to humans.
This category is used for agents for which 
there is limited evidence of carcinogenicity  in 
humans and less than sufficient evidence of car -
cinogenicity  in experimental animals. It may 
also be used when there is inadequate evidence 
of carcinogenicity  in humans but there is suffi -
cient evidence of carcinogenicity  in experimental 
animals. In some instances, an agent for which there is inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity  in 
humans and less than sufficient evidence of car -
cinogenicity  in experimental animals together 
with supporting evidence from mechanistic and 
other relevant data may be placed in this group. 
An agent may be classified in this category solely on the basis of strong evidence from mechanistic 
and other relevant data.
Group 3: The agent is not classifiable as to its 
carcinogenicity to humans.
This category is used most commonly for 
agents for which the evidence of carcinogenicity 
is inadequate  in humans and inadequate  or lim -
ited in experimental animals.
Exceptionally, agents for which the evidence 
of carcinogenicity is inadequate  in humans but 
sufficient  in experimental animals may be placed 
in this category when there is strong evidence that the mechanism of carcinogenicity in experi -
mental animals does not operate in humans.
Agents that do not fall into any other group 
are also placed in this category.
An evaluation in Group 3 is not a determi -
nation of non-carcinogenicity or overall safety. It often means that further research is needed, 
especially when exposures are widespread or 
the cancer data are consistent with differing interpretations.
Group 4: The agent is probably not 
carcinogenic to humans.
This category is used for agents for which 
there is evidence suggesting lack of carcinogenicity  
30Preamble
in humans and in experimental animals. In 
some instances, agents for which there is inad -
equate evidence of carcinogenicity  in humans 
but evidence suggesting lack of carcinogenicity  in 
experimental animals, consistently and strongly 
supported by a broad range of mechanistic and 
other relevant data, may be classified in this group.
(e) Rationale
The reasoning that the Working Group used 
to reach its evaluation is presented and discussed. 
This section integrates the major findings from 
studies of cancer in humans, studies of cancer in experimental animals, and mechanistic and 
other relevant data. It includes concise state -
ments of the principal line(s) of argument that 
emerged, the conclusions of the Working Group 
on the strength of the evidence for each group of 
studies, citations to indicate which studies were pivotal to these conclusions, and an explanation 
of the reasoning of the Working Group in weigh -
ing data and making evaluations. When there 
are significant differences of scientific interpre -
tation among Working Group Members, a brief summary of the alternative interpretations is provided, together with their scientific rationale 
and an indication of the relative degree of sup -
port for each alternative.

3233Volume 100 – General information
About half of the agents classified in Group 1 were last reviewed more than 20 years ago, before 
mechanistic studies became prominent in evaluations of carcinogenicity. In addition, more recent 
epidemiological studies and animal cancer bioassays have demonstrated that many cancer hazards 
reported in earlier studies were later observed in other organs or through different exposure scenar -
ios. Much can be learned from updating the assessments of agents that are known to cause cancer in 
humans. Accordingly, IARC has selected A Review of Human Carcinogens to be the topic for Volume 
100 of the IARC Monographs . It is hoped that this volume, by compiling the knowledge accumulated 
through several decades of cancer research, will stimulate cancer prevention activities worldwide, 
and will be a valued resource for future research to identify other agents suspected of causing cancer 
in humans.
Volume 100 was developed by six separate Working Groups:
PharmaceuticalsBiological agentsArsenic, metals, fibres, and dusts
Radiation
Personal habits and indoor combustionsChemical agents and related occupations
Because the scope of Volume 100 is so broad, its Monographs  are focused on key information. 
Each Monograph  presents a description of a carcinogenic agent and how people are exposed, critical 
overviews of the epidemiological studies and animal cancer bioassays, and a concise review of the 
toxicokinetic properties of the agent, plausible mechanisms of carcinogenesis, and potentially sus -
ceptible populations and life-stages. Details of the design and results of individual epidemiological 
studies and animal cancer bioassays are summarized in tables. Short tables that highlight key results 
appear in the printed version of Volume 100, and more extensive tables that include all studies appear 
on the website of the IARC Monographs  programme (http://monographs.iarc.fr). For a few well-
established associations (for example, tobacco smoke and human lung cancer), it was impractical to GENERAL REMARKS
Part F of Volume 100 of the IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to

include all studies, even in the website tables. In those instances, the rationale for inclusion or exclu -
sion of sets of studies is given.
Each section of Volume 100 was reviewed by a subgroup of the Working Group with appropriate 
subject expertise; then all sections of each Monograph  were discussed together in a plenary session 
of the full Working Group. As a result, the evaluation statements and other conclusions reflect the 
views of the Working Group as a whole.
Volume 100 compiles information on tumour sites and mechanisms of carcinogenesis. This infor -
mation will be used in two scientific publications that may be considered as annexes to this volume. One publication, Tumour-Site Concordance between Humans and Experimental Animals, will ana -
lyse the correspondence of tumour sites among humans and different animal species. It will dis -
cuss the predictive value of different animal tumours for cancer in humans, and perhaps identify human tumour sites for which there are no good animal models. Another publication, Mechanisms 
Involved in Human Carcinogenesis, will describe mechanisms known to or likely to cause cancer in humans. Joint consideration of multiple agents that act through similar mechanisms should facilitate 
the development of a more comprehensive discussion of these mechanisms. Because susceptibility 
often has its basis in a mechanism, this could also facilitate a more confident and precise description of populations that may be susceptible to agents acting through each mechanism. This publication 
will also suggest biomarkers that could render future research more informative. In this way, IARC 
hopes that Volume 100 will serve to improve the design of future cancer studies.
Introduction to Volume 100F
This sixth and final part of Volume 100 of the IARC Monographs  contains updated assessments 
of several chemical agents, complex mixtures, and related occupations that were classified as car -
cinogenic to humans  (Group  1)  in Volumes 1–99. In the early 1970s, the IARC Monographs  began 
as a programme to evaluate chemical substances; among the agents considered in the present vol -
ume, 4-aminobiphenyl, auramine production, and benzidine were first reviewed in Volume 1 ( IARC, 
1972 ), benzo[ a]pyrene in Volume 3 ( IARC, 1973 ), and 2-naphthylamine, bis(chloromethyl)ether, and 
chloromethyl methyl ether in Volume 4 ( IARC, 1974 ). For most of these chemicals, the cancer hazard 
was recognized already when they were first reviewed, although the classification in Group 1 was 
formalized later, in Working-Group meetings for Supplements 1, 4, and 7 ( IARC, 1979 , 1982 , 1987 ).
Some workplace conditions entail complex exposures to varying chemical mixtures. This makes 
it difficult to attribute an excess cancer risk to specific causal agents, particularly in the absence of long-term follow-up studies showing a reduction of risk following the removal of specific agents from 
the workplace. Accordingly, this Volume 100F also contains updated assessments of chemical-related occupations and industries that were classified in Volumes 1–99 as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1) .
The agents that are assessed in the present volume were last reviewed during IARC Monograph  
meetings dating from 1987 till 2008 (see Table ).
It should be noted that, in the present volume, some of these agents are named slightly differently, 
compared with previous evaluations.

Specific remarks about some of the agents reviewed in this volume
Four aromatic amines (4-aminobiphenyl, benzidine, 2-naphthylamine, ortho -toluidine) and two 
related industrial processes (auramine production, magenta production) were re-affirmed as Group-1 
carcinogens based on sufficient evidence  that they cause cancer of the urinary bladder in humans. 
The Group-1 classification of dyes metabolised to benzidine was based on sufficient evidence  of carci -
nogenicity for some of these dyes in experimental animals and strong mechanistic evidence indicat -
ing that the metabolism of these dyes leads to the release of free benzidine – a re-affirmed Group-1 
carcinogen – and to the subsequent induction of chromosomal aberrations in all experimental ani -
mal species studied, and in humans exposed to these dyes. Likewise, the Group-1 classification of 
4,4ʹ-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) was based on sufficient evidence  of carcinogenicity in experimen -
tal animals and strong mechanistic evidence, indicating that the toxicological profile of this genotoxic 
amine is similar to that of ortho -toluidine (a re-affirmed Group-1 carcinogen), that it forms DNA 
adducts in human urothelial cells in vitro  and haemoglobin adducts in the blood of exposed work -
ers, and that it causes cytogenetic alterations in urothelial cells and lymphocytes of exposed workers.
Exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) causes cancers of the skin and lung in 
humans. Although there are no epidemiological studies of benzo[ a]pyrene as a single exposure, it 
is carcinogenic in numerous animal species. There is mechanistic evidence indicating that benzo[ a]
pyrene is metabolized to highly reactive diolepoxides that form covalent DNA adducts, which have 
been shown to induce mutations in the K- RAS  oncogene and the TP53  tumour-suppressor gene in 
human lung tumours, and in corresponding genes in lung tumours in mice. Exposures to benzo[ a]
pyrene and benzo[ a]pyrene-containing complex mixtures also induce cytogenetic alterations, DNA 
breakage, oxidative DNA lesions, and specific mutations in oncogenes and tumour-suppressor genes, 
all of which can contribute to the carcinogenic effects of benzo[ a]pyrene and benzo[ a]pyrene-con -
taining complex mixtures in exposed humans. This consistent and coherent mechanistic evidence 
from experimental and human studies provides biological plausibility to support the overall classifi -
cation of benzo[ a]pyrene as a Group-1 carcinogen.
Two PAH-containing mixtures (chimney soot, coal-tar pitch), and occupational exposures in four 
PAH-related industries (coal-tar distillation, coal gasification, coke production, aluminium produc -
tion) were confirmed as Group-1 carcinogens.
Workers in the rubber-manufacturing industry have an increased risk for leukaemia, lymphoma, 
and cancers of the urinary bladder, lung, and stomach. Due to the diversity and complexity of the 
exposures during rubber-manufacturing, the Working Group – like the previous one three decades ago ( IARC Monograph  Volume 28, 1982) – could not identify specific causative agents. However, there 
continues to be strong evidence of genotoxic and cytogenetic effects in workers in this industry.
There is consistent evidence that untreated or mildly treated mineral oils cause cancer of the skin, 
specifically of the scrotum, in humans. The association is highly unlikely to be due to chance, bias, 
or confounding, given the large case series, supportive epidemiological evidence, the rarity of scrotal 
cancer, and the intensity of exposure during the period of interest. Despite the fact that a significant proportion of workers exposed occupationally to mineral oils and shale oils are women, epidemio -
logical studies established a statistically significant risk only for skin cancer in the scrotum, because of the extreme rarity of this type of cancer at this site. This observation does not imply that the skin-cancer hazard is restricted to males.
36General remarks
Evidence from three cohort studies indicated that exposure of humans during the manufacture 
of isopropyl alcohol by the strong-acid process causes cancer of the paranasal sinuses, an extremely 
rare cancer. The risk for laryngeal cancer may also have been elevated in these workers. This evalu -
ation re-affirms the conclusion of a previous Working Group ( IARC, 1987 ). It was noted that since 
that time none of these cohorts nor any other isopropanol-manufacturing unit has been evaluated for cancer mortality or incidence without the inclusion in the study population of workers in other 
production units. An increased incidence of other cancers in the upper respiratory tract was observed in these studies, but it was not possible to attribute these cancers to exposures during isopropanol 
production. Therefore, the possible association of these tumours with this specific exposure could 
not be evaluated.
The Working Group reviewed more than 100 epidemiological studies of benzene and confirmed 
its carcinogenicity, with sufficient evidence  for acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia and limited evidence  
for acute and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The Working Group noted the extraordinary expansion in the epidemiological literature on benzene-
related cancers since the previous evaluation, the diversity of industrial and environmental exposure 
scenarios where benzene has been studied, and the evolution in the histological classification of leu -
kaemias and lymphoid neoplasms over the past decades, and suggested that a re-evaluation of the 
cancer hazards from exposure to benzene be conducted in due time.
Dioxin (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo- para -dioxin, TCDD) was previously classified in Group 1, 
based on limited evidence  of carcinogenicity in humans, sufficient evidence  in rodents, and strong 
evidence in humans and animals for a mechanism via initial binding to the aryl-hydrocarbon recep -
tor (AhR), which leads to changes in gene expression, cell replication, and apoptosis. There is now 
sufficient evidence  from epidemiological studies for all cancers combined, making TCDD the first 
agent classified initially in Group 1 based on sufficient evidence  of carcinogenicity in experimental 
animals and strong mechanistic data, to be later confirmed by increased cancer incidence in humans. This highlights the ability of mechanistic information to provide robust evidence of carcinogenicity. 
Like TCDD, 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran and 3,3 ʹ,4,4ʹ,5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126) are 
complete carcinogens in experimental animals, and there is ample evidence that they act through the 
same AhR-mediated mechanism. The Working Group classified these two chemicals in Group 1. The 
Working Group discussed the possibility of evaluating an additional 26 polychlorinated dibenzodi -
oxins, dibenzofurans and biphenyls for carcinogenicity, based upon data showing similarity to the 
mechanism outlined for TCDD. According to the IARC Monographs Preamble (Part B, Section 6d), 
an evaluation may be made for a broad group of agents, even including substances for which there is 
no direct information on cancer in humans or experimental animals, if it is warranted by the overall evidence. Recognizing the complexity of the mechanistic evaluation, the Working Group decided 
this time to make evaluations for two indicator chemicals, 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran and 
3,3′,4,4′,5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126), for which there are recent positive NTP bioassays, sup -
ported by data on a wide range of mechanistic events. The Working Group suggested that a future 
generic evaluation be focused on the entire class of dioxin-like compounds, taking into account the 
available mechanistic data.
The Working Group unanimously reaffirmed the classification of formaldehyde in Group 1, based 
on sufficient evidence  in humans of nasopharyngeal cancer. A possible association with leukaemia 
was considered strong “but not sufficient” by a previous Working Group, mainly because of the lack of a plausible mechanism. Since that time, the epidemiological evidence has become stronger: a recent 
37IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
study found that embalming was significantly associated with an increased risk for myeloid leukae -
mia, with cumulative years of embalming and with increasing peak-exposure to formaldehyde. In 
addition, a recent study of a small group of workers exposed to formaldehyde showed numerical 
chromosomal aberrations in myeloid progenitor cells (chromosome-7 monosomy, chromosome-8 trisomy) as also observed in myeloid leukaemia, and haematological changes in peripheral blood that 
are indicative of effects on the bone marrow. A small majority of the Working Group concluded that, 
overall, there is sufficient evidence  of a causal association between exposure to formaldehyde and an 
increased risk for leukaemia, particularly myeloid leukaemia.
Identification of tumour sites
One of the goals of the review of Group-1 carcinogens in Volume 100 of the IARC Monographs  is 
the identification of tumour sites with sufficient evidence  in humans. The tumour-site identification in 
this volume was – naturally – limited by the research that has been published to date, and it should be noted that many plausible tumour sites identified in rodents have not been considered in humans. For example, several aromatic amines induce mammary gland tumours in rats, and there is mechanistic 
evidence that supports a potential for aromatic amines to cause this cancer, but the epidemiological 
studies on cancer associated with exposure to these substances have not considered breast cancer, mainly because the industrial cohorts were generally small and did not include women. In addition, 
no case–control studies are available on breast cancer associated with exposure to aromatic amines. 
Similarly, mammary gland tumours are the only tumour induced by 1,3-butadiene in both rats and mice, but epidemiological studies – while demonstrating an increased risk for leukaemia – have just 
started to explore the possibility of this chemical being associated with breast cancer.
Changes in occupational exposures over time
Changes in occupational hygiene or industrial processes can alter the profile of workplace expo -
sures over time. Moreover, regulations and working conditions may differ greatly from one country to another. For these reasons, it is useful to identify the specific agents responsible for excess can -
cer risks whenever possible (see IARC Monographs  Preamble Part B, Section 6a). It is important to 
recognize that new studies of modern and improved workplaces would not reflect risks that might still exist in areas where adequate regulations or process improvements are not fully implemented. 
Consequently, previous evaluations of occupations that were classified as carcinogenic to humans  
stand as a historical record of hazards that are known to cause cancer. In future monographs, as his -
torical exposures described as occupations are reduced and risk is abated, previous findings should be noted as indicative of potential carcinogenic risk in this occupation should historical exposure levels return or continue to exist elsewhere. Also, as industrial processes change, carcinogenicity profiles 
in the workplace will change and evaluations need to take these changing processes into account.
38General remarks
Incorporation of new mechanistic data in future evaluations
The ever-increasing understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning the classical con -
cepts of initiation, promotion and progression in cancer provides a challenge for its integration into 
cancer-hazard identification. In most instances, genotoxic pathways have been considered central 
to the carcinogenic process and mechanistic studies characterizing these outcomes have provided important supporting information for the evaluation. The panel of genotoxic endpoints has been 
extended over the years, from classical mutagenicity in bacteria to the current demonstration of 
mutation induction in oncogenes and tumour-suppressor genes.
Mechanisms of non-genotoxic carcinogenesis are being identified for an increasing number of 
chemicals evaluated by the IARC Monographs . In the future, this area will undoubtedly expand into 
processes mediated by epigenetic events. Collectively, new types of information are being used to assess these mechanisms, such as epigenomics, proteomics, metabolomics and systems-biology approaches. 
These strategies have identified changes in specific genes, proteins, signalling pathways, networks of 
pathways, cell-cycle genes and transcription factors. Other studies have focused on changes in meth -
ylation, and on patterns of microRNA expression and effects of small interfering RNA (si-RNA). 
Proteomics studies have identified post-translational modifications, and metabolomic studies have 
revealed how endogenous metabolite patterns change after exposure. These studies are conducted in human and non-human cells, tissues from experimental animals, and in human tissues following 
occupational and/or environmental exposures. It is recommended that IARC convene an Advisory 
Group to develop guidelines for the evaluation and incorporation of this type of information to sup -
port a specific mechanism and/or to derive an evaluation of carcinogenicity for a specific exposure.

1.2 Uses
4-Aminobiphenyl has been used in the past as 
a rubber antioxidant, as a dye intermediate, and 
in the detection of sulfates. It is reportedly used 
as a model carcinogen in mutagenicity studies and in cancer research ( NTP, 20 05 ; O’Neil, 2006 ; 
HSDB, 2009 ).1.3 Human exposure
1.3.1  Occupational exposure
Historically, occupational exposure to 
4-aminobiphenyl mainly occurred during its 
production and its use as a rubber antioxidant 
and dye intermediate. No exposure measure -
ments are available for these occupational expo -
sure situations ( IARC, 2010 ).
Occupational exposure can also occur when 
workers are exposed to products contaminated 
with 4-aminobiphenyl, or in the case of expo -
sure to benzidine and benzidine-based dyes, 
from which 4-aminobiphenyl can be metaboli -
cally released ( IARC, 2010 ). In a study from India 
on workers exposed to benzidine or benzidine-based dyes and a non-exposed control group, urine samples were analysed for 4-amino -
biphenyl and acetylated 4-aminobiphenyl (Ac4ABP). 4-Aminobiphenyl was found in 30 of 33 urine samples from exposed workers and 
in one sample from the 13 control workers. The 
workers exposed to benzidine had significantly higher median 4-aminobiphenyl concentrations 
(57 pmol/mL) than those exposed to benzidine-
based dyes (29.3 pmol/mL). Ac4ABP was only detected (79.5 pmol/mL) in the urine sample that 
was provided by the person who had the highest 
4-aminobiphenyl concentration ( Beyerbach 
et al., 2006 ).4-AMINOBIPHENYL
4-Aminobiphenyl was considered by previous IARC Working Groups in 1971, 1987 , and 2008 
(IARC, 1972 , 1987 , 2010 ). Since that time new data have become available, which have been 
incorporated in this Monograph,  and taken into consideration in the present evaluation.IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
1.3.2  Non-occupational exposure
The main sources of exposure to 4-aminobi -
phenyl for the general population are cigarette 
smoking and second-hand tobacco smoke, as 
4-aminobiphenyl is formed during tobacco combustion. The following amounts of 4-amino -
biphenyl have been reported in unfiltered main -
stream, filtered mainstream and side-stream cigarette smoke, respectively: 2.4 to 4.6 ng/ciga -
rette; 0.2 to 23 ng/cigarette; and up to 140 ng/ciga -
rette ( Patrianakos & Hoffmann, 1979 ; Hoffmann 
et al., 1997 ).
Other potential sources include hair dyes and 
food colourant. 4-Aminobiphenyl can occur as a contaminant in 2-aminobiphenyl, which is used 
in the manufacture of dyes. 4-Aminobiphenyl 
has been detected in aniline, in the drug and cosmetic colour additive D&C Yellow No. 1, in 
the food dye FD&C Yellow No. 6, and in hair dyes 
(Richfield-Fratz et al ., 1985 ; Chiang et al ., 1999 ; 
Turesk y et al ., 2003 ; Akyüz, 2007 ; Bafana et al ., 
2007 ). 4-Aminobiphenyl has also been found as a 
contaminant in diphenylamine, a fungicide that has been used on apples.
4-Aminobiphenyl has been detected in fume 
from cooking oils. In a study from Taiwan, China, concentrations of 4-aminobiphenyl 
were 35.7 μg/m
3 in fumes from cooking with 
sunflower oil, 26.4 μg/m3 in vegetable oil fumes 
and 23.3 μg/m3 in oil fumes from refined lard 
(Chiang et al., 1999 ).
Living near benzidine-contaminated sites 
may result in exposure to 4-aminobiphenyl, as 
benzidine in the environment can be degraded 
to 4-aminobiphenyl by certain bacteria ( Bafana 
et al., 2007 ).2. Cancer in Humans
2.1 Descriptive studies
Melick et al . (1955)  reported a series of 19 
cases of cancer of the urinary bladder in 171 male workers (11.1%) engaged in the production 
of 4-aminobiphenyl. The exposure took place in a chemical plant in the United States of America 
(USA) between 1935 and 1955. In a follow-
up study it was reported that among 315 male workers exposed to 4-aminobiphenyl, 53 had 
developed bladder tumours ( Melick et al., 1971 ).
2.2 Cohort studies
Following the cessation of industrial produc -
tion of 4-aminobiphenyl in 1955, a surveillance programme in exposed workers revealed 31 of 
285 men with significantly abnormal epithelial 
cells in urinary sediments, of whom ten were 
diagnosed with histologically confirmed bladder carcinoma ( Melamed et al., 1960 ). Subsequently, 
11 additional cases were found among 18 of the men reported in 1960 to have abnormal cells ( Koss et al ., 1965 ). Expanded surveillance 
programmes identified 35 workers with cancer of the urinary bladder among 503 workers ( Koss 
et al ., 1969 ) and 43 men with confirmed bladder 
carcinoma among 86 men with suspicious or positive histology ( Melamed, 1972 ).
Cancer mortality was studied among 884 
male workers at a chemical plant in West Virginia (USA) that produced a variety of chemicals. A ten-fold increase in mortality from bladder cancer was 
reported, with all nine cases having started work 
before 4-aminobiphenyl production ceased in the plant in 1952 ( Zack & Gaffey, 1983 ). An analysis 
of mortality through 1987 showed 11 deaths from 
cancer of the urinary bladder among workers in 
jobs with possible exposure to 4-aminobiphenyl, compared to 0.54 expected ( Collins et al ., 1993 ). 
Exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo- p-dioxin 
424-Aminobiphenyl
(TCDD) was also considered, based on reports of 
chloracne related to an industrial accident with 
TCDD in 1949, but ten of the 11 workers who 
died of cancer of the urinary bladder did not have chloracne. Collins et al . (1999)  conducted 
another cohort study in the same plant and eval -
uated the risk for cancer of the urinary bladder associated with exposure to 4-aminobiphenyl 
and another bladder carcinogen, 2-mercapto -
benzothiazole (MBT). Eight workers in jobs with 
exposure to 4-aminobiphenyl and MBT died of 
cancer of the urinary bladder, 0.3 deaths were 
expected (SMR 27.1; 95%CI: 11.7–53.4), while five workers exposed to MBT in jobs associated with 
little or no exposure to 4-aminobiphenyl died of 
cancer of the urinary bladder, compared with 1.2 expected.
2.3 Synthesis 
Case reports and cohort-surveillance 
studies indicate a high occurrence of cancer of 
the urinary bladder in workers occupationally 
exposed to 4-aminobiphenyl, supported by eval -
uations of mortality in a chemical plant in the 
USA. Bladder cancer is strongly associated with 
occupational exposure to 4-aminobiphenyl.
3. Cancer in Experimental Animals
Studies on the carcinogenicity of 4-aminobi -
phenyl in the mouse, rat, dog, and rabbit after 
oral administration or after subcutaneous or 
intraperitoneal injection have been reviewed in previous IARC Monographs  (IARC, 1972 , 1987 , 
2010 ). The results of adequately conducted carci -
nogenicity studies are summarized in Table  3.1 . 
There have been no additional carcinogenicity 
studies in animals reported since the most recent 
evaluation ( IARC, 2010 ).
4-Aminobiphenyl was tested for carcino -
genicity by oral administration in three studies in mice, six studies in dogs and one study in rabbits, by subcutaneous injection in one study 
in mice and one study in rats and by intraperito -
neal injection in four studies in mice.
Oral administration of 4-aminobiphenyl 
caused increased incidences of angiosarcoma 
(all sites) in male and female mice, bladder carcinoma in male mice ( Schieferstein et al ., 
1985 ), hepatocellular carcinoma in female mice 
(Clayson et al ., 1967 ; Schieferstein et al ., 1985 ), 
and bladder carcinoma in male and female dogs 
(Walpole et al ., 1954 ; Deichmann et al ., 1958 , 
1965 ; Block et al ., 1978 ) and in rabbits (sex not 
specified) ( Bonser, 1962 ). [The Working Group 
noted that there were limitations in the design 
and reporting of these studies.] The incidence of hepatocellular adenoma and/or carcinoma 
was increased in male mice after subcutaneous 
(Gorrod et al ., 1968 ) or intraperitoneal injection 
(Dooley et al ., 1992 ; Parsons et al ., 2005 ). [Most 
of these studies were designed to study tumour formation in the liver and the histopathology is limited to examination of the liver only.]

4.1 Aromatic amines: metabolism, 
genotoxicity, and cancer 
susceptibility
Biotransformation pathways and genotoxic 
effects of aromatic amines are described in detail 
in IARC (2010) ; highlights are summarized 
below.
Exposures to aromatic amines, such as 
2-naphthylamine, 4-aminobiphenyl and benzi -
dine in the textile dye and rubber tyre industries 
have long been known to cause cancer of the 
urinary bladder in humans. These substances also 
induce neoplasms at multiple organ sites in labo -
ratory animals. Tobacco smoke and hair dyes are 
major non-occupational sources of exposure to

arylamines, as is demonstrated by the detection 
of aminobiphenyl-haemoglobin adducts (Bryant 
et al ., 1988 ; Ward et al ., 1996 ; Beyerbach et al ., 
2006 ), which can be 3- to 10-fold more abun -
dant in tobacco smokers than in nonsmokers (Yu et al ., 2002 ). Other environmental sources 
of exposure are likely to exist as well, because 
biomarkers derived from aromatic amines, such 
as haemoglobin adducts or urinary metabolites 
have been identified also in non-smokers who are not occupationally exposed to these chemicals.
Multiple metabolic pathways are involved 
in the activation of aromatic amines to DNA-reactive intermediates. Metabolism is 
initiated in the liver with either N -oxidation 
(by cytochrome P-450-associated enzymes) or 
N-acetylation (by N -acetyltransferase 2, NAT2). 
N-oxidation to N -hydroxyarylamine is mainly 
mediated by CYP1A2, but also CYP1A1 and CYP4B1 iso-enzymes may play a role ( Landi 
et al ., 1996 ; Ketelslegers et al ., 2009 ). NAT2-
catalysed N-acetylation can provide a detoxi -
fication pathway for aromatic amines since it 
reduces the amount of parent compound that 
may undergo CYP-mediated N -hydroxylation. 
The N-hydroxy metabolite is highly electrophilic: 
N-hydroxyaminobiphenyl, the oxidation product 
of 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP) forms adducts with hepatic DNA at the C8 position of deoxygua -
nosine and deoxyadenosine in rats ( Jones & 
Sabbioni, 2003 ). N-hydroxyarylamines may be 
transported in free form to the blood or be conju -
gated with glucuronide. The acid-labile glucuro -
nidated intermediate is excreted via the kidney and hydrolysed in the bladder lumen where it 
eventually forms the N -hydroxy metabolite again. 
The acidic pH of urine enhances the hydrolysis 
reaction and thus represents an additional risk 
factor for aromatic amine-related bladder cancer. 
NAT1-mediated O-acetylation may represent the 
final activation step of N -hydroxyarylamines; 
it takes place in the bladder epithelium and forms N-acetoxyarylamine. Breakdown of this 
unstable aromatic acetoxy ester produces the highly reactive aryl nitrenium ion that may serve as electrophilic intermediate leading to DNA 
adducts and tumour initiation. The highly active 
NAT1*10 isoform was correlated with higher levels of arylamine-DNA adducts in the human 
bladder ( Kadlubar & Badawi, 1995 ).
Other activation pathways of aromatic 
amines to DNA-reactive intermediates include the sulfotransferase-mediated activation of 
N-hydroxyarylamine to an N-sulfate ester ( Chou 
et al., 1995 ), the myeloperoxidase- ( Lakshmi et al., 
2000 ) and lactoperoxidase-mediated pathways 
that catalyse activation in the mammary gland (Gorlewska-Roberts et al ., 2004 ), the peroxida -
tive activation by prostaglandin H synthase (Flammang et al ., 1989 ) – likely predominant 
in extra-hepatic tissues with low levels of cyto -
chrome P450 isoenzymes –, and non-enzymatic protonation of the N -hydroxylamine nitrogen 
(Beland et al., 1983 ). Genotoxic aromatic amines 
may induce tumour formation at different sites depending on substrate specificity and different bio-activation pathways. Inter-individual vari -
ability in prostaglandin H synthases in the urinary bladder and in myeloperoxidases in the lung may account for differences in target-site 
susceptibility to aromatic amines in cigarette 
smokers ( Flammang et al., 1989 ).
The genotoxic effects of aromatic amines are 
well established on the basis of mutagenicity and clastogenicity observed in numerous in vitro  
and in vivo  assays that show the capability of 
these compounds to form DNA adducts after metabolic activation to electrophilic intermedi -
ates. The predominant site for covalent binding 
of aromatic amines to DNA is the C8 position 
of guanine, but adducts at other sites, including C8 of adenine and N
2 of guanine, have also been 
identified ( Beland et al ., 1983 ; Kaderlik et al ., 
1993 ; Lin et al ., 1994 ; Rothman et al ., 1996a ). As 
DNA adducts may lead to somatic point muta -
tions, it is reasonable to assume that activated 
aromatic amines may lead to bladder-tumour 
development by inducing mutations in key genes 
484-Aminobiphenyl
such as the TP53  tumour suppressor gene ( Sørlie 
et al., 1998 ; Feng et al., 2002 ) and the H-RAS  gene 
(Boulalas et al ., 2009 ), both involved in bladder 
carcinogenesis.
Organ specificity and inter- and intra-species 
differences in cancer susceptibility to aromatic 
amines are likely related to polymorphisms in genes that regulate DNA-repair, since deficient 
DNA-repair capacity is associated with increased 
bladder cancer risk ( Lin et al ., 2005 ), and to 
polymorphisms in genes that encode enzymes 
involved in activation or detoxification pathways. 
The NAT2  slow-acetylator genotype accounts for 
a greater risk for cancer of the urinary bladder 
in individuals exposed to 2-naphthylamine or 
4-aminobiphenyl ( Yu et al., 2002 ) and for a lower 
risk in workers exposed to benzidine ( Carreón 
et al ., 2006 ). Conflicting findings between 
studies may be a consequence of the interde -
pendence of pathways of arylamine metabolism 
and of the capability of N -acetyltransferases both 
to detoxify the parent compound and to activate 
metabolites at different rates in different tissues.
4.2 4-Aminobiphenyl
N-hydroxylation of 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP) 
in human and rat-liver microsomes is primarily 
catalysed by CYP1A2 ( Kimura et al ., 1999 ), an 
enzyme with a large inter-individual variability 
(Butler et al ., 1989 ), and by extra-hepatic cyto -
chrome P450s including CYP1A1, CYP1B1, and CYP2A13 ( Shimada et al., 1996 ; Nakajima et al., 
2006 ). In extra-hepatic tissues, the binding of 
4-ABP to DNA may be catalysed by peroxidase enzymes, such as prostaglandin H synthase (Flammang et al., 1989 ).
The major 4-ABP-DNA adduct identified in 
human bladder and lung is N -(deoxyguanosin-
8-yl)-4-ABP ( Lin et al ., 1994 ): other adducts 
include N-(deoxyadenosin-8-yl)-4-ABP and 
N-(deoxyguanosin- N
2-yl)-4-ABP ( Beland et al ., 
1983 ). N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-4-ABP has also 
been detected in female breast tissue of both smokers and non-smokers ( Lin et al., 1994 ; Faraglia 
et al., 2003 ) indicating that 4-ABP-reactive inter -
mediates are distributed systemically and/or that multiple organs are capable of activating 4-ABP or its metabolites. Experiments in animals show 
that 4-ABP induces bladder tumours in mice, 
rabbits, and dogs, liver tumours, mammary gland tumours and angiosarcomas in mice, and 
intestinal tumours in rats. Increased levels of 
4-ABP-haemoglobin adducts are associated with cigarette smoking ( Bryant et al., 1988 ), and occu -
pational exposure to 4-ABP is associated with an increased risk for cancer of the urinary bladder (Beyerbach et al., 2006 ).
To explore the role of various metabolic 
intermediates in the mutageniticy of aromatic amines, the DNA-damaging potential of 4-ABP 
was studied in different bacterial strains. In S. 
typhimurium  in the presence of S-9-mediated 
metabolic activation, 4-ABP was found to induce mutations such as frameshifts and base substi -
tutions in TA98 and TA100 strains, respectively 
(Chung et al., 2000 ), and oxidant-induced muta -
tions in TA102, suggesting an oxidative mecha -
nism ( Makena & Chung, 2007 ). 4-ABP-induced 
DNA damage was mainly due to activation 
by NAT1 ( Oda, 2004 ) and was increased with 
higher O-acetyltransferase activity ( Dang & 
McQueen, 1999 ), thus demonstrating the poten -
tially important role of N -acetoxy-4-ABP in the 
mutagenicity of this aromatic amine. In E. coli , 
4-ABP induced base-pair substitutions predomi -
nantly at G sites, including G→T, G→C transver -
sions, and G→A transitions ( Verghis et al., 1997 ). 
In addition, G→C transversion mutations were triggered by incorporating an oligonucleotide 
containing the N -(deoxyadenosin-8-yl)-4-ABP 
adduct into the single-stranded DNA of the 
cloning vector, demonstrating the role of this 
adduct in 4-ABP-induced mutagenesis.
4-ABP induced mutations at the HPRT  locus 
and chromosomal instability in human bladder epithelial cells. In 4-ABP-induced liver tumours in B6C3F1 and CD-1 mice, primarily C→A and A→T 
49IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
mutations, respectively, were detected at codon 
61 of the H-Ras  gene. 4-ABP also increased the 
mutation frequency in the bladder, liver, and bone marrow of mice. In human bladder cells treated with N -hydroxy-4-ABP, preferential sites 
of adduct formation in TP53  were at codons 175, 
248, 280, and 285, which are mutational hotspots for cancer of the urinary bladder ( Feng et al ., 
2002 ).
5. Evaluation
There is sufficient evidence  in humans 
for the carcinogenicity of 4-aminobiphenyl. 
4-Aminobiphenyl causes cancer of the urinary 
bladder.
There is sufficient evidence  in experi -
mental animals for the carcinogenicity of 4-aminobiphenyl.
There is strong mechanistic evidence indi -
cating that the carcinogenicity of 4-amino -
biphenyl in humans operates by a genotoxic mechanism of action that involves metabolic 
activation, formation of DNA adducts, and 
induction of mutagenic and clastogenic effects. Metabolic activation to DNA-reactive interme -
diates occurs by multiple pathways including N-oxidation in the liver, O -acetylation in the 
bladder, and peroxidative activation in the 
mammary gland and other organs.
4-Aminobiphenyl is carcinogenic to humans

1.2 Uses
Benzidine has been used since the 1850s as the 
reagent base for the production of a large number of dyes, particularly azo dyes for wool, cotton, and 
leather ( IARC, 2010 ). In the past, benzidine also 
has been used in clinical laboratories for detec -
tion of blood, as a rubber compounding agent, in the manufacture of plastic films, for detection of hydrogen peroxide in milk, and for quantita -
tive determination of nicotine. Most of these uses have been discontinued because of toxicological concerns. Some dyes used as stains for micros -
copy and similar laboratory applications may contain benzidine as an impurity ( ATSDR, 2001 ; 
NTP, 20 05 ).
Manufacture of benzidine is prohibited in 
several individual countries (e.g. Japan, Republic of Korea, Canada, and Switzerland) and in 
Europe through European Union (EU) legisla -
tion. It has not been manufactured on a large 
scale for commercial purposes in the United BENZIDINE
Benzidine was considered by previous IARC Working Groups in 1987 and 2008 ( IARC, 1987 , 
2010 ). Since that time new data have become available, which have been incorporated in 
this Monograph,  and taken into consideration in the present evaluation.IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
States of America (USA) since 1976, although 
small quantities remain available for diagnostic 
testing. It is reportedly produced and/or supplied 
in research quantities in Germany, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, India, the 
People’s Republic of China (China), Switzerland, 
and the USA ( IARC, 2010 ). Production and use 
of benzidine in dye production has been reported 
in some developing countries, as has the transfer 
of benzidine production from other European countries to the former Serbia and Montenegro 
and to the Republic of Korea ( Carreón et al ., 
2006a ).
In 1994, the German Government prohib -
ited the use of certain azo dyes in consumer 
goods that come in direct, prolonged contact with human skin (e.g. clothing, bedding, foot -
wear, gloves, etc.). The dyes affected are those that, after reduction of one or more azo groups, may release one or more of 20 specific aromatic amines (including benzidine) in detectable concentrations (i.e. > 30 parts per million (ppm)). In 2002, a EU Directive (76/769/EEC) expanded coverage to articles that come in contact with the oral cavity and added two amines to the list (Ahlström et al ., 2005 ; ETAD, 2008 ). The US 
Food and Drug Administration limits benzi -
dine content in food colourants to 1 part per billion (ppb). While exposure via ingestion is considered highly unlikely, other impurities in synthetic colouring agents may be metabolized to benzidine after ingestion ( ATSDR, 2001 ).1.3 Human exposure
1.3.1  Occupational exposure
Estimates of numbers of workers potentially 
exposed to benzidine have been published by 
CAREX (CARcinogen EXposure) in Europe. 
CAREX is an international information system that provides selected exposure data and docu -
mented estimates of the number of exposed workers by country, carcinogen, and industry (Kauppinen et al ., 2000 ). Based on data on 
occupational exposure to known and suspected carcinogens collected from 1990 to 1993, it is estimated from the CAREX database that 
6900 workers were exposed to benzidine in the 
European Union. Table  1.1  presents the results 
for benzidine by industry in the EU ( CAREX, 
1999 ).
NIOSH (1984)  estimated from the US National 
Occupational Exposure Survey (1981–83) that 
1554 workers (including 426 women) were poten -
tially exposed to benzidine and 2987 workers 
(2464 women) to benzidine dihydrochloride.
Studies that reported airborne or urinary 
concentrations and results of dermal wipes of benzidine or benzidine derivatives in the benzi -
dine-based dye industry have been reviewed (IARC, 2010 ).
1.3.2  Non-occupational exposure
Because benzidine may be produced only 
for captive consumption (i.e. in-house by the 
producer only, in closed systems with stringent 
controls), its direct release into the environment is expected to be low.
Benzidine-based dyes can contain various 
amounts of benzidine as a contaminant. The general population can be exposed to benzidine 
when in contact with consumer goods containing 
benzidine or benzidine based-dyes such as leather products ( Ahlström et al., 2005 ), clothes and toys 
(Garrigós et al., 2002 ). Some food colourants such 
as tartrazine and sunset yellow FCF have been

2. Cancer in Humans
In a previous IARC Monograph  (IARC, 2010 ) 
it was concluded that there is sufficient evidence  
in humans for the carcinogenicity of benzidine in the human bladder. Numerous case reports from different countries have been published 
(IARC, 1972 , 1982 , 1987 , 2010 ). In one extreme 
instance, all five of a group of workers perma -
nently employed in the manufacture of benzi -
dine for 15 years or more developed bladder 
cancer ( IARC, 1982 ). Vigliani & Barsotti (1962)  
reported on 20 workers with tumours of the 
urinary bladder between 1931 and 1948 among 
83 Italian dyestuff workers involved in benzidine production and use. Case et al . (1954)  found 10 
bladder-cancer deaths among dyestuff workers exposed only to benzidine (standardized mortality ratio (SMR) 13.9 [95%CI: 6.7–25.5]). In 
benzidine-exposed workers in the chemical dye 
industry in China, the morbidity from bladder cancer increased with increasing duration of 
exposure (p for trend < 0.01) ( Sun & Deng, 1980 ), 
while in a cohort of benzidine manufacturers in 
the USA, risks were significantly elevated for 
those with ≥2 years exposure to benzidine (SMR 
13.0 [95%CI: 4.8–28.4]) ( Meigs et al ., 1986 ). In 
a cohort of dyestuff workers in Torino, Italy, 
the SMR was 100.8 [95%CI: 60.8–167.2] during 
exposure and 14.8 [95%CI: 71–31.0] at 20 or more years after exposure ceased ( Piolatto et al., 1991 ). 
In a study of workers from a chemical manu -
facturing plant in Shanghai, China, an interac -
tion was found between benzidine exposure and 
cigarette smoking in the development of bladder 
cancer ( Wu, 1988). Relative to those who did not 
smoke and had no exposure to benzidine, the 
risks (RR) for bladder cancer were 6.2 ( P = 0.05) 
for smokers who were not exposed to benzidine; 63.4 ( P < 0.05) for non-smokers exposed to benzi -
dine; and 152.3 ( P < 0.01) for smokers exposed to 
benzidine. In another study of Chinese workers in 
benzidine production and use facilities, the odds ratios (OR) for bladder cancer were 1.0, 2.7 (1.1–
6.3) and 4.4 (1.8–10.8) for low, medium and high 
cumulative exposure to benzidine, respectively, after adjustment for life-time cigarette smoking 
(Carreón et al., 2006b ). In a case–control study in 
Canada, excesses of renal cell cancer in relation 
to duration of exposure to benzidine ( P < 0.004) 
were noted, but other consistently supporting data were not found ( Hu et al., 2002 ).
Overall, case reports and epidemiological 
investigations from several countries show strong and consistent associations between benzidine 
exposure and risk for bladder cancer.
3. Cancer in Experimental Animals
Studies on the carcinogenicity of benzidine 
in the mouse, rat, hamster, rabbit, dog, and frog by oral, subcutaneous injection, intraperitoneal 
injection, or inhalation routes of exposure have been reviewed by previous IARC Working Groups 
(IARC, 1972 , 1982 , 1987 , 2010 ). There have been 
no additional carcinogenicity studies in animals 
reported since the most recent evaluation ( IARC, 
2010 ). Results of adequately conducted carcino -
genicity studies are summarized in Table 3.1 .
Benzidine and its dihydrochloride were 
adequately tested for carcinogenicity by oral administration (feed, drinking-water or gavage) in eight experiments in mice and one experi -
ment in rats; by subcutaneous injection in one experiment in rats and one experiment in frogs; and in rats in one experiment by intraperitoneal 
injection.
Following oral administration to male and 
female mice, newborn and adult, of different strains, benzidine significantly increased the

Vesselinovitch, 1983 ; Nelson et al., 1982 ; Littlefield

dine caused a markedly increased incidence of mammary carcinomas in female rats ( Griswold 
et al ., 1968 ). Subcutaneous administration of 
benzidine or its sulfate to male and female rats produced a high incidence of external audi -
tory canal carcinomas ( Spitz et al ., 1950 ), while 
subcutaneous administration of benzidine to frogs caused an increase in tumours of the liver and haematopoietic system ( Khudoley, 1977 ). 
The intraperitoneal administration of benzidine to female rats resulted in an increase in the inci -
dence of mammary gland adenocarcinomas and 
combined benign and malignant Zymbal gland 
tumours ( Morton et al., 1981 ). Other studies were 
found to be inadequate for evaluation.
4. Other Relevant Data
A general section on “Aromatic amines: 
metabolism, genotoxicity, and cancer suscepti -
bility” appears as Section 4.1 in the Monograph  
on 4-aminobiphenyl in this Volume.
Benzidine, N-acetylbenzidine, and 
N,N′-diacetylbenzidine have been detected in 
the urine of workers exposed to benzidine. The predominant DNA adduct identified in exfo -
liated bladder cells was N′-(deoxyguanosin-
8-yl)- N-acetylbenzidine ( Rothman et al ., 
1996a ). Thus, N -monoacetylation of benzidine 
does not interfere with the formation of a DNA-reactive intermediate, and may occur before the cytochrome P450-catalysed forma -
tion of N ′-hydroxy- N-acetylbenzidine. In 
contrast, N,N′-diacetylation may be a detoxi -
fication pathway. N -Acetylbenzidine may be 
N-glucuronidated or N -hydroxylated in the liver. 
In the bladder, the N ′-hydroxyl- N-acetylbenzidine or N′-acetoxy- N-acetylbenzidine formed by 
NAT-mediated O-acetylation may react with 
DNA to form covalent adducts. NAT1 is more effi -
cient than NAT2 in catalysing the N-acetylation 
of benzidine or of N -acetylbenzidine 
(Zenser et al ., 1996 ). At low exposure levels, 
N-acetylation of benzidine is favoured over 
that of N-acetylbenzidine. Human neutrophils 
can also form N ′-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)- N-
acetylbenzidine from N -acetylbenzidine by a 
reaction catalysed by myeloperoxidase ( Lakshmi 
et al ., 2000 ). N′-hydroxy- N-acetylbenzidine 
may also be formed through peroxidative acti -
vation by prostaglandin H synthase ( Zenser 
et al., 1999a , b). Levels of benzidine-related DNA 
adducts in exfoliated urothelial cells among exposed workers were not affected by acetylator 
phenotype ( Rothman et al ., 1996a ), or GSTM1  
genotype ( Rothman et al., 1996b ).
For several benzidine-based azo dyes, both 
metabolism and molecular changes identical to 
those of benzidine have been observed. Metabolic conversion of Direct Black 38, Direct Blue 6, and 
Direct Brown 95 to benzidine has been observed 
in the Rhesus monkey ( Rinde & Troll, 1975 ). 
Azoreductase activity in intestinal bacteria and 
in the liver catalyses the formation of benzidine 
from benzidine-based dyes ( Cerniglia et al., 1982 ; 
Bos et al., 1986 ).
Benzidine is a multiorgan carcinogen in 
experimental animals; it induces bladder tumours in dogs, liver tumours in mice and hamsters, 
and mammary gland tumours in rats. In the 
presence of a liver-derived metabolic activation system – which in some cases leads to reduc -
tive metabolism followed by oxidative metabo -
lism – benzidine and benzidine-based dyes (e.g. Direct Black 38, CI Acid Red 114, CI Direct 
Blue 15, and CI Pigment Red) were mutagenic 
in several strains of S. typhimurium.  Benzidine, 
N-acetylbenzidine, and N,N ′-diacetylbenzidine 
have been measured in the urine of workers exposed to Direct Black 38, and benzidine- or 4-ABP-related haemoglobin adducts have been 
60Benzidine
measured in blood ( Dewan et al., 1988 ; Beyerbach 
et al ., 2006 ). Significant increases in the inci -
dence of chromosomal aberrations in peripheral 
lymphocytes have been observed in workers exposed to benzidine or benzidine-based dyes 
(Mirkova & Lalchev, 1990 ). In workers exposed 
to benzidine, the accumulation of mutant p53 
protein increased with increasing exposures 
(Xiang et al., 2007 ). Similarly, benzidine induced 
DNA lesions in TP53  in the bladder, liver, and lung 
of exposed rats ( Wu & Heng, 2006 ), increased 
the frequency of micronucleated bone-marrow 
cells and induced unscheduled DNA synthesis in mice, and increased DNA strand-breaks in the 
liver of exposed rats.
Based on bio-monitoring studies in workers, 
animal carcinogenicity data and genotoxicity data, it is reasonable to use the same carcino -
genic hazard classification for benzidine-based 
dyes that are metabolized to benzidine as for 
benzidine.
5. Evaluation
There is sufficient evidence  in humans for the 
carcinogenicity of benzidine. Benzidine causes cancer of the urinary bladder.  
There is sufficient evidence  in experimental 
animals for the carcinogenicity of benzidine. 
There is strong mechanistic evidence indi -
cating that the carcinogenicity of benzidine in 
humans operates by a genotoxic mechanism of 
action that involves metabolic activation, forma -
tion of DNA adducts, and induction of mutagenic 
and clastogenic effects. Metabolic activation to DNA-reactive intermediates occurs by multiple 
pathways including N -oxidation in the liver, 
O-acetylation in the bladder, and peroxidative 
activation in the mammary gland and other organs.

1.2 Uses
In general, benzidine-based dyes were used 
primarily to colour textiles, leather, and paper products and also in the petroleum, rubber, 
plastics, wood, soap, fur, and hair-dye indus -
tries. More than 300 benzidine-based dyes are 
listed in the Colour Index, including 18 that 
were commercially available in the United States of America (USA). Access to these dyes for home 
use is no longer permitted in the USA, but some – 
in particular direct browns, greens, and blacks – were available as consumer products in the 1970s (IARC, 2010 ). Direct Black 38, Direct Blue 6, and 
Direct Brown 95 were used on textiles (such as 
cotton, silk, wool, nylon, and acetate) and on 
leather. In addition, Direct Black 38 and Direct Blue 6 were used in aqueous printing inks, in 
hair dyes and as biological stains; Direct Black 38 
and Direct Brown 95 were used in plastics; Direct Blue 6 and Direct Brown 95 were used in paper; 
and, Direct Black 38 was used in wood stains 
and wood flour ( Society of Dyers and Colourists, 
1971 ; NCI, 1978 ).
By the mid-1970s, most manufacturers in the 
USA started phasing out the use of benzidine-based dyes and replacing them with other types 
of dyes ( NIOSH, 1980 ). In 1994, the German 
Government prohibited the use of certain azo 
dyes in consumer goods that come in direct 
prolonged contact with human skin (e.g. clothing, 
bedding, footwear, gloves, etc.). The dyes affected are those that, after reduction of one or more azo 
groups, may release one or more of 20 specific 
aromatic amines (including benzidine) in detect -
able concentrations (i.e. > 30 ppm). In 2002, the 
European Union published a Directive (76/769/
EEC) that expanded the coverage to compounds that come in contact with the oral cavity, and 
added two amines to the list ( Ahlström et al ., 
2005 ; ETAD, 2008 ).
1.3 Human exposure
1.3.1 Occupational exposure
Occupational exposure to benzidine-based 
dyes can occur during the production and use of these substances. The primary routes of potential 
exposure to benzidine-based dyes are inhalation and accidental ingestion; dermal absorption 
can also occur. The potential for exposure has 
declined since the late 1970s, as benzidine-based dyes were removed from both industrial and 
consumer markets and replaced with other types 
of dye. Since 1980, use of mixtures containing benzidine at concentrations of 0.1% or more is 
66Dyes metabolized to benzidine
permitted only in closed systems; all workers 
must observe special precautions to reduce expo -
sure, and strict procedures must be followed to 
transport such materials ( IARC, 1982 ).
Exposure studies in workers involved in 
manufacture and use of benzidine-based dyes generally were designed to measure benzidine 
rather than the benzidine-based dyes. Studies 
that reported airborne and urinary concentra -
tions and results of dermal wipes of benzidine 
in the benzidine-based dye industry have been 
reviewed ( IARC, 2010 ).
Estimates of numbers of workers potentially 
exposed to benzidine-based dyes have been published by CAREX (CARcinogen EXposure) in Europe. CAREX is an international information 
system that provides selected exposure data and 
documented estimates of the number of exposed workers by country, carcinogen, and industry 
(Kauppinen et al ., 2000 ). Based on data on 
occupational exposure to known and suspected 
carcinogens collected from 1990 to 1993, it is estimated that 13920 workers were exposed to 
benzidine-based dyes in the European Union 
(CAREX, 1999 ; Table 1.1 ).
From the US National Occupational Hazard 
Survey (1972–74) it was estimated that 79200 workers in 63 occupations (primarily the dye 
manufacturing, textile dyeing, printing, paper, 
and leather industries) were potentially exposed to benzidine-based dyes ( NIOSH, 1980 ). A 
decade later, estimates from another US National Occupational Exposure Survey (1981–83) indi -
cated that about 33900 workers were potentially 
exposed to one or more of 13 benzidine-based 
dyes. Although no current estimate of occupa -
tional exposure to this type of dye is available, 
the number of potentially exposed workers is 
expected to be much lower than in the past ( NTP, 
2005 ).
1.3.2 Non-occupational exposure
Benzidine-based dyes can contain various 
amounts of benzidine as a contaminant. The 
general population can be exposed to benzidine-
based dyes when in contact with consumer goods containing such dyes, e.g. leather products (Ahlström et al., 2005 ), clothes and toys ( Garrigós 
et al., 2002 ). Some food colourants such as tartra -
zine and sunset yellow FCF have been reported to contain trace amounts of benzidine (<  5 to 
270 ng/g) ( Lancaster & Lawrence, 1999 ).

2. Cancer in Humans
Benzidine-based dyes (i.e. dyes metabolized 
to benzidine) were most recently reviewed in IARC Monograph  Volume 99 ( IARC, 2010 ). 
2.1 Cohort Studies
Three azo dyes metabolized to benzidine, 
Direct Black 38, Direct Blue 6 and Direct Brown 95, were evaluated in previous IARC 
Monographs  (IARC, 1982 , 1987 , 2010 ). The most 
recent evaluation ( IARC, 2010 ) stated that there 
was inadequate evidence  in humans for the 
carcinogenicity of dyes metabolized to benzi -
dine. Stern et al. (1987)  studied 9365 production 
workers (7085 men, 2280 women) employed at two leather tanneries where detectable quantities of benzidine were identified in bulk dyes (prob -
ably derived from the dyes). Excesses of cancer of the urinary bladder were not observed. The same author ( Stern, 2003 ) conducted a follow-up 
study with the same result (see Table 2.1, avail -
able online at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100F/100F-03-Table2.1.pdf ). 
Costantini et al . (1989)  carried out a cohort-
mortality study of 2926 male workers employed in tanneries between 1950 and 1981 in Italy. 
Known exposures in the plants included dyes 
metabolized to benzidine, dyes metabolized to 3,3′-dimethylbenzidine and dyes metabolized 
to 3,3′ -dimethoxybenzidine. No significant 
excesses of cancer of the urinary bladder were found (5 deaths, SMR 1.5, 95%CI: 0.5–3.5). You 
et al . (1990)  observed only one case of cancer 
of the urinary bladder in 1210 workers (1060 men, 150 women) from 17 knitting factories, 10 
stocking factories, nine silk printing and dyeing factories and seven printing and dyeing facto -
ries in China. Fifteen types of benzidine-derived dye had been used in these 43 factories, Direct 
Black 38 being the most common. Montanaro et 
al. (1997)  reported on mortality in a cohort of 
1224 workers employed at a chrome tannery in Italy between 1955 and 1988 who were exposed to azo dyes metabolized to benzidine and other 
chemicals in the tanning process. An excess risk 
for cancer of the urinary bladder was observed (10 deaths, SMR 2.4, 95%CI: 1.2–4.5).
2.2 Case–control studies
Yoshida et al . (1971)  reported an excess 
risk for cancer of the urinary bladder (OR, 6.8, 
P  =  0.002) in male workers in the silk-dyeing 
industry in Japan, in a case–control study of 
200 bladder-cancer cases and 148 controls. At 
least seven of the 17 patients with bladder cancer 
worked as kimono painters, reportedly using benzidine-based dyes. Myslak et al. (1991)  found 
an excess risk for cancer of the urinary bladder among painters in Germany (OR, 2.9, 95%CI: 1.3–6.6). Benzidine-based dyes were manufac -
tured in that country before 1950 and painters were reported to prepare the paints themselves. These studies do not provide data specifically on 
dyes metabolized to benzidine.
2.3 Synthesis
There is a lack of clear and consistent evidence 
from epidemiological studies that dyes metabo -
lized to benzidine cause cancer in humans.
3. Cancer in Experimental Animals
Studies on the carcinogenicity of dyes metab -
olized to benzidine in mice and rats exposed by the oral route or through bladder implantation 
have been reviewed ( IARC, 1987 , 2010 ). There

have been no additional carcinogenicity studies 
in animals reported since those reviews. Results 
of adequately conducted carcinogenicity studies 
are summarized in Table 3.1 . 
Three dyes that would be metabolized to 
benzidine, Direct Black 38, Direct Blue 6 and Direct Brown 95, were tested for carcinogenicity by oral administration (feed or drinking-water) 
or bladder implantation. Direct Black 38 was 
adequately tested in one drinking-water study in mice and in one feeding study in mice and 
rats. Following its oral administration to mice in 
the drinking-water for 60 weeks, Direct Black 38 significantly increased the incidence of hepato -
cellular carcinomas and mammary gland cancers (Asada et al., 1981 ). Oral administration of Direct 
Black 38 to male and female rats in the diet for 
only 13 weeks caused a significant increase of 
hepatocellular carcinomas in males and of liver neoplastic nodules in both sexes ( NTP, 1978 ; 
Robens et al., 1980 ). Direct Blue 6 was adequately 
tested in one feeding study in mice and rats and one bladder-implantation study in mice. Oral 
administration of Direct Blue 6 to male and 
female rats in the diet for only 13 weeks caused a significant increase in hepatocellular carcinomas 
in females and of hepatocellular carcinomas and 
liver neoplastic nodules combined in both sexes (NTP, 1978 ; Robens et al ., 1980 ). The bladder-
implantation study in mice showed a slight increase in transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder (Niitsu, 1973 ). Direct Brown 95 
was adequately tested in a feeding study in mice and rats. Oral administration of Direct Brown 95 to male and female rats in the diet for only 
13 weeks caused a significant increase in hepato -
cellular carcinomas and liver neoplastic nodules 
combined in females ( NTP, 1978 ; Robens et al ., 
1980 ).4. Other Relevant Data
A general Section on “Aromatic amines: 
metabolism, genotoxicity, and cancer suscepti -
bility” appears as Section 4.1 in the Monograph  
on 4-aminobiphenyl in this volume. 
For details on benzidine and benzidine-
based dyes, see Section 4 of the Monograph  on 
Benzidine in this volume.
5. Evaluation
There is inadequate evidence  in humans 
for the carcinogenicity of dyes metabolized to 
benzidine. 
There is sufficient evidence  in experimental 
animals for the carcinogenicity of Direct Black 38, Direct Blue 6, and Direct Brown 95. 
There is sufficient evidence  in experimental 
animals for the carcinogenicity of dyes metabo -
lized to benzidine.
There is strong mechanistic evidence indi -
cating that benzidine-based dyes are converted by azoreduction to benzidine in humans and 
in experimental animals and, consequently, produce DNA adducts and genotoxic effects 
similar to those of benzidine.
Dyes metabolized to benzidine are carcino -
genic to humans (Group 1) .
In making the overall evaluation, the Working 
Group considered the following:
•	there is sufficient evidence  in humans and 
in experimental animals for the carcino -
genicity of benzidine.
•	the metabolism of benzidine-based dyes 
results in the release of free benzidine and 
the induction of chromosomal aberra -
tions in humans, and in all experimental 
animal species studied.

72731. Exposure Data
1.1 Identification of the agent 
From IARC (2010)  unless indicated otherwise
Chem. Abstr. Serv. Reg. No. : 101-14-4
Chem. Abstr. Serv. Name : 
4,4′-Methylenebis(2-chlorobenzenamine)
Synonym : this compound is commonly 
known as methylenebis( ortho- chloroani -
line), MOCA
CH2Cl
H2NCl
NH2
C13H12Cl2N2 
Relative molecular mass: 267.15
Description : Colourless to yellow or light-
brown crystalline solid with a faint amine-
like odour
Solubility : Slightly soluble in water; soluble 
in dilute acids, ether, alcohol ( O’Neil, 2006 )1.2 Uses
MOCA is used primarily as a curing agent for 
polyurethane pre-polymers in the manufacture of castable urethane rubber products (e.g. shock-
absorption pads and conveyor belting). In the laboratory, MOCA is used as a model compound 
for studying carcinogens ( NTP, 20 05 ; O’Neil, 
2006 ; IARC, 2010 ).
1.3 Human exposure
1.3.1  Occupational exposure
Occupational exposure to MOCA can occur 
during its production and use in the polyurethane industry. Workers can be exposed to MOCA 
when it is processed in the form of a liquid emul -
sion, as solid pellets with dust, or as solid pellets 
without dust. In most cases, dermal absorption 
after contact with contaminated surfaces is the most important occupational exposure route, 
with inhalation and ingestion representing 
minor exposure pathways ( IARC, 1993 ).
CAREX (CARcinogen EXposure) is an inter -
national information system on occupational 4,4′-METHYLENEBIS(2-
CHLOROBENZENAMINE)
4,4′-Methylenebis(2-chlorobenzenamine) (MOCA) was considered by previous IARC 
Working Groups in 1973, 1992, and 2008 ( IARC, 1974 , 1987 , 2010 ). Since that time new data 
have become available, which have been incorporated in this Monograph,  and taken into 
consideration in the present evaluation.IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
exposure to known and suspected carcinogens, 
based on data collected in the European Union 
(EU) from 1990 to 1993. The CAREX database 
provides selected exposure data and documented estimates of the number of exposed workers by 
country, carcinogen, and industry ( Kauppinen 
et al ., 2000 ). Table 1.1  presents the results for 
MOCA by industry in the EU ( CAREX, 1999 ).
An estimated 10000 workers were exposed 
to MOCA in industrialized countries in 1972 
(Rappaport & Morales, 1979 ; Will et al ., 1981 ). 
In 1979, an estimated 1400 workers in the United States of America (USA) were directly exposed and 7400 indirectly exposed by working in poly -
urethane-manufacturing processes involving MOCA ( Ward et al ., 1987 ). More recently, the 
Health and Safety Executive estimated that 
in 2005–06 approximately 300 workers in the 
United Kingdom were directly exposed to MOCA during polyurethane-elastomer production and 
over 1000 workers were indirectly exposed (e.g. 
office staff) ( HSE, 2007 ; Cocker et al., 2009 ). 
(a) Exposure measurements
MOCA levels in air, blood and urine and 
in surface-wipe samples have been reported for workers employed in the production and use 
of this chemical in several countries. Different 
analytical methods have been applied, which complicates comparison of reported MOCA 
levels ( IARC, 2010 ). Surface wipes have been 
used mainly to give an indication of potential for 
dermal exposure to MOCA by anyone working 
in the area. As measurement of airborne MOCA 
alone is considered ineffective in the assessment of worker exposure ( Robert et al ., 1999 ), post-
shift measurement in urine is the most employed method to assess exposure. The concentration of MOCA in urine reflects recent exposure, since 
the biological half-life of this compound is 
approximately 23 hours ( Osorio et al ., 1990 ). In 
some studies urinary concentrations of acetyl-
MOCA have been determined in addition to 
those of MOCA, showing that N -acetyl-MOCA is a minor urinary metabolite compared with the elimination of the parent amine ( Cocker et al ., 
1988 ; Shih et al., 2007 ).
An alternative to measuring MOCA in urine 
is to determine haemoglobin-MOCA adducts in 
blood. These adducts are stable for the lifespan of 
haemoglobin, which in humans is about 120 days (Vaughan & Kenyon, 1996 ).
(b) MOCA production
Air concentrations of MOCA have been 
reported from two production plants. In a study 
from the USA ( Linch et al ., 1971 ), the airborne 
concentration of MOCA was below the detec -
tion limit. In a study from Taiwan, China ( Chen 
et al ., 2005 ), the highest concentrations in air 
(0.41 mg/m
3) were recorded during the purifica -
tion of MOCA.
Measurements of MOCA concentrations in 
the urine of production workers from France, 
Taiwan (China), and the USA were reviewed 
recently ( IARC, 2010 ). In workers without gloves 
or protective clothing, concentrations ranged up 
to several thousand µg/L; the values were much 
lower when proper protection had been used.
(c) Polyurethane-production workers
Measurements of MOCA concentrations in 
the urine of polyurethane-production workers 
from Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the USA were reviewed 
recently ( IARC, 2010 ). The use of protective 
equipment and the application of safety proce -
dures reduced the values from several hundred µg/L to as low as 1–10 µg/L.
1.3.2  Non-occupational exposure
The general population can be exposed to 
MOCA in areas that have been contaminated with MOCA ( Keeslar, 1986 ) or through consumption 
of certain types of plant (e.g. root crops) grown 
in contaminated soil ( ATSDR, 1994 ). Immediate 
family members of workers exposed to MOCA 
74MOCA
were reported to have concentrations of up to 
15 µg/L in their urine ( Keeslar, 1986 ).
In 1979, extensive environmental contami -
nation with MOCA was discovered on several hundred hectares of land surrounding a MOCA 
plant in Adrian, MI, USA. Concentrations of 
up to several mg/kg were found in gardens and community-recreation areas. MOCA was also 
found in the urine of young children living in the 
contaminated area ( Keeslar, 1986 ). Of 12 selected 
children, aged 2 to 16 years, six were found to have detectable concentrations of MOCA in their urine, ranging from 0.3–1.0 ppb (µg/L). 
These six children were all under the age of six 
years. Contact with contaminated soil during playing and going barefoot were considered the 
most likely routes of exposure. The general adult 
population living in the contaminated area had no detectable MOCA concentrations in urine 
(IARC, 2010 ).
2. Cancer in Humans
Bladder-cytology surveys have identified 
bladder-cancer cases in workers exposed to 
MOCA in Michigan, USA ( Ward et al ., 1988 , 
1990 ), New Jersey, USA ( Mason & Vogler, 1990 ; 
Mason et al ., 1992 ), and Taiwan (China) ( Chen 
et al ., 2005 ), but expected numbers were not 
calculated, so risks for bladder cancer cannot be evaluated. Dost et al. (2009)  reported on a cohort 
of 308 male MOCA-production workers in the United Kingdom and found one bladder-cancer death in the period 1979–2007, with 0.18 deaths 
expected (SMR 5.6; 95%CI: 0.14–31.2), based on 
the United Kingdom mortality rates.
No adequate epidemiological studies were 
available to the Working Group to evaluate an association between MOCA and bladder-cancer risk.
3. Cancer in Experimental Animals
Studies on the carcinogenicity of MOCA 
in mice, rats, and dogs after oral administra -
tion, subcutaneous injection or dermal appli -
cation have been reviewed in previous IARC Monographs  (IARC, 1974 , 1987 , 1993 , 2010 ). 
Results of adequately conducted carcinogenicity studies are summarized in Table 3.1 . There have 
been no additional carcinogenicity studies in 
animals reported since the most recent evalua -
tion ( IARC, 2010 ).
MOCA was tested for carcinogenicity by oral 
administration (in the feed or in a gelatin capsule) 
in one experiment in mice, five experiments in rats and one experiment in dogs; by subcuta -
neous injection in one experiment in rats; and 
as an initiator or as a promoter in three experi -
ments in mice, following dermal application.
Following its oral administration (feed) to 
female mice and male rats, MOCA increased the 
incidence of hepatomas ( Russfield et al ., 1975 ).

rats increased the incidence of hepatomas and 
lung tumours ( Grundmann & Steinhoff, 1970 ). 
Oral administration (feed) to rats of both sexes caused an increased incidence of lung and mammary gland adenocarcinoma, and 
hepatocellular carcinoma in two studies ( Stula 
et al., 1975 , Kommineni et al., 1979 ). MOCA also 
caused haemangiosarcomas and Zymbal gland carcinomas in male rats in one of these studies 
(Kommineni et al., 1979 ). Oral administration of 
MOCA in a gelatin capsule caused carcinomas 
of the urinary bladder in female dogs ( Stula 
et al ., 1978 ). Subcutaneous injection of MOCA 
produced an increased incidence in hepatocel -
lular carcinoma and lung cancer in rats ( Steinhoff 
& Grundmann, 1971 ). After dermal application, 
MOCA was neither an initiator nor a promoter in the two experiments in mice ( Nesnow et al ., 
1985 ; Rozinova et al., 1998 ).
4. Other Relevant Data
A general Section on “Aromatic amines: 
metabolism, genotoxicity, and cancer suscepti -
bility” appears as Section 4.1 in the Monograph  
on 4-aminobiphenyl in this volume.
Studies on the metabolism, genotoxicity, and 
animal carcinogenicity of MOCA indicate that 
this substance acts similarly to other aromatic amines that are known to cause cancer of the 
urinary bladder in humans.
CYP2A6 or CYP3A4 catalyse N -oxidation of 
MOCA ( Butler et al ., 1989 ; Yun et al ., 1992 ) to 
N-hydroxy-MOCA, which can bind to DNA or 
haemoglobin, or can be further activated to an 
N-sulfate ester by liver sulfotransferases ( Chou 
et al ., 1995 ). Also prostaglandin H synthase 
(Wiese et al ., 2001 ) and myeloperoxidase ( Culp 
et al ., 1997 ) may catalyse the binding of MOCA 
to DNA. In exfoliated urothelial cells from MOCA-exposed workers, the predominant DNA adduct was N -(deoxyadenosin-8-yl)-4-amino-3-chlorobenzyl alcohol ( Kaderlik et al ., 1993 ). The 
same adduct was found in the liver, lung and 
kidney of rats exposed to MOCA ( Silk et al., 1989 ). 
In rat liver the adduct N -(deoxyadenosin-8-yl)-
4-amino-3-chlorotoluene was also detected. MOCA-DNA adducts were found in the liver and 
bladder of exposed dogs. Metabolites in urine and blood and haemoglobin adducts have been 
detected in workers in the polyurethane elas -
tomer industry ( Vaughan & Kenyon, 1996 ). In 
contrast to the situation with benzidine, very low levels of N -acetylated metabolites were observed 
in urine. Because human liver can also catalyse 
the N-acetylation of MOCA, these low urinary 
levels may reflect an efficient de-acetylation pathway ( Lakshmi et al., 1995 ).
MOCA is a multiorgan carcinogen in experi -
mental animals: it induces bladder tumours in dogs, liver tumours in rats and mice, and haemangiosarcomas, lung, and mammary gland 
tumours in rats. Particularly compelling data on 
the genotoxicity of MOCA include the higher micronucleus frequencies measured in exfoli -
ated bladder epithelial cells and in peripheral lymphocytes of exposed workers ( Murray & 
Edwards, 1999 ). MOCA and N -hydroxy-MOCA 
are mutagenic in S. typhimurium  (Bridges et al ., 
1981 ; Kuslikis et al ., 1991 ). In addition, MOCA 
induced mutations at the HPRT  locus in human 
lymphoblastoid cells, it stimulated prophage induction in E. coli , and caused aneuploidy in 
S. cerevisiae , unscheduled DNA synthesis in 
cultured mouse hepatocytes, transformation in several mammalian cell cultures, and sister chromatid exchange in lymphocytes of rats

5. Evaluation
There is inadequate evidence  in 
humans for the carcinogenicity of 
4,4′-methylenebis(2-chlorobenzenamine).
There is sufficient evidence  in experi -
mental animals for the carcinogenicity of 4,4′-methylenebis(2-chlorobenzenamine). 
There is strong mechanistic evidence 
indicating that the carcinogenicity of 4,4′-methylenebis(2-chlorobenzenamine) 
involves a genotoxic mechanism of action that 
includes metabolic activation, formation of 
DNA adducts, and induction of mutagenic and 
clastogenic effects in humans. Metabolic activa -
tion to DNA-reactive intermediates occurs by 
multiple pathways including N -oxidation in the 
liver, O-acetylation in the bladder, and peroxida -
tive activation in the mammary gland and other organs.
4,4′-Methylenebis(2-chlorobenzenamine) is 
carcinogenic to humans (Group 1) .
In making the overall evaluation, the Working 
Group considered that:
The genotoxicity of 4,4 ′-methylenebis(2-
chlorobenzenamine) is well documented and its 
toxicological profile is similar to that of ortho -
toluidine, thus indicating a common mode of 
action. 4,4 ′-Methylenebis(2-chlorobenzenamine) 
has been shown to interact with DNA to form 
adducts in urothelial cells, and with haemoglobin 
to form adducts in the blood of workers exposed 
to this compound. It has also been shown to cause the formation of sister chromatid exchange and 
micronuclei in urothelial cells and lymphocytes 
of exposed workers.

1.2 Uses
2-Naphthylamine formerly was used 
commercially as an intermediate in the manu -
facture of dyes, as an antioxidant in the rubber 
industry, and to produce 2-chloronaphthalene (IARC, 2010 ). Because of its carcinogenicity, the 
manufacture and use of 2-naphthylamine have 
been prohibited in the European Union (EU) 
since 1998, in Italy since 1960, in the United Kingdom since 1952, and in Switzerland since 
1938. Production and use of dyestuffs containing 
2-naphthylamine have been banned in Japan since 1972 ( Olfert et al ., 2006 ). In the United 
States of America (USA), 2-naphthylamine is a carcinogen regulated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). As such, 
exposure must be strictly controlled through 
mandatory use of engineering controls, safe work practices, and personal protective equip -
ment ( OSHA, 2011 ).
Small quantities of 2-naphthylamine are 
used in laboratory research ( IARC, 2010 ). The 
substance has been found as a contaminant in other chemicals and industries ( Olfert et al ., 
2006 ). Phenyl-β-naphthylamine (PBNA) has 
been used as a substitute; however, it partially metabolizes in the body to 2-naphthylamine (Olfert et al., 2006 ).2-NAPHTHYLAMINE
2-Naphthylamine was considered by previous IARC Working Groups in 1973, 1987 , and 2008 
(IARC, 1974 , 1987 , 2010 ). Since that time new data have become available, which have been 
incorporated in this Monograph,  and taken into consideration in the present evaluation.IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
1.3 Human exposure
1.3.1  Occupational exposure
In the past, occupational exposure to 2-naph -
thylamine mainly occurred during its produc -
tion and when it was used in the manufacture 
of azo dyes. Exposure may still occur in labo -
ratories where it is used as a model compound 
in cancer research, when workers are exposed 
to pyrolysis fumes containing 2-naphthylamine (e.g. foundry fumes, second-hand tobacco smoke, 
heated cooking-oils), to 2-nitronaphthalene 
(e.g. foundry workers), a nitro-PAH that can be metabolized to 2-naphthylamine, or to products 
containing 2-naphthylamine as a contaminant, 
such as certain rubber chemicals ( IARC, 2010 ). 
Countries in which exposure was reported 
include: Italy, Japan, the Russian Federation, the 
United Kingdom, and the USA ( IARC, 2010 ).
CAREX (CARcinogen EXposure) is an inter -
national information system on occupational exposure to known and suspected carcino -
gens, based on data collected in the European Union (EU) from 1990 to 1993. The CAREX database provides selected exposure data and 
documented estimates of the number of exposed 
workers by country, carcinogen, and industry (Kauppinen et al ., 2000 ). Table 1.1  presents the 
results for 2-naphthylamine by industry in the EU ( CAREX, 1999 ).
From the US National Occupational 
Exposure Survey (1981–83) it was estimated that 
275 workers, including 265 women, were poten -
tially exposed to 2-naphthylamine ( NIOSH, 
1990 ). Exposure data were reported for a 2-naph -
thylamine/benzidine dye factory in Moscow (Bulbulyan et al ., 1995 ). 2-Naphthylamine 
concentrations in indoor air samples taken in the factory during the period 1939–1948 ranged from <  1 µg/L to >  3 µg/L. Factory-wall wipes sampled in 1948 contained 60.0–115 mg/m
2 wall 
surface. Dermal wipes sampled in 1940 and 1947 from workers after a shower at work contained between 0.018 and 37.5 mg 2-naphthylamine (data on the surface area sampled were not available).In a German study of workers primarily 
exposed to aniline and 4-chloroaniline, urinary 
2-naphthylamine concentrations were 0–9.8 µg/L 
(mean, 3.9 ± 2.2) in 22 smokers and 0–11.6 µg/L (mean, 2.1 ± 2.8) in 21 non-smokers, both signifi -
cantly higher than the concentrations measured in non-smoking, non-exposed workers (0.0–1.6 µg/L; mean, 0.5  ±  0.7) ( Riffelmann et al ., 
1995 ).
In a study of two Danish iron foundries, 
airborne PAH concentrations were measured 
in relation to 2-naphthylamine (as a possible 
marker of 2-nitronaphthalene) in the urine of PAH-exposed workers ( Hansen et al., 1994 ). The 
concentration of 2-naphthylamine in urine was significantly higher in PAH-exposed workers than in controls (matched for smoking habits). 
Hand moulders, finishing workers and truck 
drivers tended to have the highest levels. These results may be explained by the presence of 
2-nitronaphthalene (which can metabolized 
to 2-naphthylamine), the presence of aromatic amines, e.g. in moulding sand, or the presence 
of nitrogen oxides, e.g. in diesel exhaust. It has 
been estimated that a maximum of 1% of total N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine uptake can be trans -
formed into 2-naphthylamine ( Weiss et al., 2007 ).
1.3.2  Non-occupational exposure
The general population can be exposed to 
2-naphthylamine through tobacco smoke and 
other fumes containing 2-naphthylamine, or reportedly when in contact with dyes and hair dyes contaminated with 2-naphthylamine [The Working Group could not find evidence of current contamination of these consumer products]. Exposure to 2-nitronaphthalene, which is formed by incomplete combustion of organic material and generally found in the environment in a mixture with other nitro-PAH and non-nitro-PAH, can also become an indirect source of contact with 2-naphthylamine ( IARC, 
2010 ).
842-Naphthylamine
Mainstream cigarette smoke from eight 
different conventional market cigarettes in the 
USA contained 2-naphthylamine at concentra -
tions of 1.47 to 14.06 ng/cigarette ( Stabbert et al., 
2003 ). A review of similar studies in the IARC 
Monograph on tobacco indicated that amounts 
of 2-naphthylamine in mainstream cigarette smoke range from 1–22 ng/cigarette; those in 
sidestream cigarette smoke range from 113.5–
171.6 ng/cigarette ( IARC, 2004 ).
In a German study ( Grimmer et al ., 2000 ), 
2-naphthylamine was found in urine in compa -
rable levels for non-smokers ( n = 14; mean, 120.8 
ng/24 hours), smokers ( n = 12; mean, 84.5 ng/24 
hours) and persons exposed to second-hand 
tobacco smoke ( n = 22; mean, 94.9 ng/24 hours). 
In a study by Riedel et al. (2006) , smokers ( n = 10) 
excreted significantly higher amounts of 2-naph -
thylamine compared with non-smokers ( n = 10) 
(20.8 vs 10.7 ng/24 hours).
2-Naphthylamine has been detected in fumes 
of heated cooking-oils ( Chiang et al ., 1999 ) in a 
study in Taiwan (China) looking at three different 
commercial cooking oils. Concentrations of 
2-naphthylamine in oil fumes were 31.5 µg/m
3 
for sunflower oil, 31.9 µg/m3 for vegetable oil, and 
48.3 µg/m3 for refined lard oil.
2. Cancer in Humans
Studies of cancer in humans exposed to 
2-naphthylamine were most recently reviewed by a Working Group in 2008 ( IARC, 2010 ): it 
was concluded that there was sufficient evidence  in humans for the carcinogenicity of 2-naphthyl -
amine in the human urinary bladder. Numerous case series reported bladder cancer in workers 
exposed to 2-naphthylamine; in coal-tar dye workers exposed to 2-naphthylamine, and not to 
other aromatic amines, the cumulative incidence 
of bladder cancer was 25% ( Goldwater et al ., 
1965 ). Eleven cohort studies (four in the USA, 
two in the United Kingdom, two in Japan, and one each in Poland, the Russian Federation and Italy) are available concerning bladder-cancer risks in workers engaged in the manufacture and 
use of 2-naphthylamine (see Table 2.1 available 
at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/
vol100F/100F-05-Table2.1.pdf ). All these studies 
indicate markedly elevated bladder cancer risks associated with the manufacture and use of 2-naphthylamine. In most of the studies, it was 
not possible to quantify the relative contributions 
of exposures to benzidine and 2-naphthylamine to the overall excess risks. However, Case et al . 
(1954)  had reported 26 bladder-cancer deaths, 
with 0.3 expected [SMR 86.7, 95%CI: 56.6–127.0], in British dyestuff-industry workers exposed to 
2-naphthylamine. Also, in a study of bladder-
cancer risks in the British rubber industry, Veys (2004)  showed excesses of bladder cancer 
in workers employed between 1946 and 1949 when 2-naphthylamine-contaminated antioxi -
dants were still used (58 cases, SIR 1.71; 95%CI: 1.3–2.21) and no excess in workers employed after this exposure was removed (39 cases, SIR 
1.02 95%CI: 0.72–1.39).

3. Cancer in Experimental Animals
Studies on the carcinogenicity of 2-naph -
thylamine in the mouse, rat, hamster, rabbit, 
dog, and monkey after oral administration, after 
subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injection, after intravesicular implantation, or after dermal 
application have been reviewed in previous IARC 
Monographs  (IARC, 1974 , 1987 , 2010 ). There have 
been no additional carcinogenicity studies in 
animals reported since the most recent evalua -
tion ( IARC, 2010 ).
2-Naphthylamine was tested for carcino -
genicity by oral administration (in the feed, by 
gavage or in a gelatin capsule) in five experi -
ments in mice, three experiments in rats, ten 
experiments in dogs, and one experiment each in 
hamsters, rabbits and monkeys; by subcutaneous administration in five experiments in mice; by 
intraperitoneal injection in two experiments in 
mice and one in rats; and by one intravesicular implantation and one skin-painting study in 
mice and one bladder instillation study in dogs. 
Results of adequately conducted carcinogenicity studies are summarized in Table 3.1 .
Oral administration of 2-naphthylamine to 
mice caused a significant increase in the incidence of cholangiomas, hepatomas and liver adenomas 
(Bonser et al ., 1952 ; Yoshida et al ., 1979 ) and 
induced ‘malignant’ hepatomas ( Bonser et al ., 
1952 ). 2-Naphthylamine caused a significant 
increase in urinary bladder tumours (including 
carcinomas) following its oral administration to rats ( Hicks et al., 1982 ; Hicks & Chowaniec, 1977 ), 
hamsters ( Saffiotti et al ., 1967 ), dogs ( Hueper 
et al ., 1938 ; Bonser et al ., 1956 ; Harrison et al ., 
1969 ; Conzelman & Moulton, 1972 ; Romanenko 
& Martynenko, 1972 ; Rigotti et al ., 1977 ; 
Purchase et al ., 1981 ) and monkeys ( Conzelman 
et al ., 1969 ). Intraperitoneal injection of 2-naph -
thylamine ( Theiss et al ., 1981 ) or its administra -
tion by gavage ( Stoner et al ., 1986 ) increased the multiplicity of benign lung tumours in strain A mice.
The results of the oral study in rabbits, the 
intraperitoneal injection study in rats, the subcutaneous injection study, the intravesicular 
implant study and the skin-painting study in 
mice, and the bladder-instillation study in dogs were found to be inadequate for the evaluation of 
the carcinogenicity of 2-naphthylamine.
4. Other Relevant Data
A general Section on “Aromatic amines: 
metabolism, genotoxicity, and cancer suscepti -
bility” appears as Section 4.1 in the Monograph  
on 4-aminobiphenyl in this volume.
2-Naphthylamine is a constituent of tobacco 
smoke, and the amounts of 2-naphthylamine-
haemoglobin adducts are higher in ciga -
rette smokers than in non-smokers ( Bryant 
et al ., 1988 ). Similarly to other aromatic amines, 
2-naphthylamine may undergo N -hydroxylation 
by CYP1A2 ( Butler et al ., 1989 ) followed by 
conjugation of the hydroxyl group with sulfate or glucuronide, or conjugation of the amino group with acetate ( N-acetylation), sulfate, or 
glucuronide. In addition, 2-naphthylamine may undergo N -oxidation and ring oxidation 
by peroxidative enzymes such as prostaglandin 
H synthase in the bladder ( Wise et al ., 1984 ; 
Yamazoe et al., 1985 ) to form an arene oxide. The 
N-hydroxylated intermediate may re-arrange 
to form 2-amino-1-naphthol and conjugates 
with sulfate or glucuronide, or form DNA adducts such as N -(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-2-NA, 
1-(deoxyguanosin- N
2-yl)-2-naphthylamine, 
and 1-(deoxyadenosin- N6-yl)-2-naphthylamine 
(Beland et al ., 1983 ). These adducts are also 
formed by prostaglandin H synthase ( Yamazoe 
et al ., 1985 ), or from the 2-imino-1-naphthoqui -
none intermediate (e.g. N4-deoxyguanosin- N2-
yl)-2-amino-1,4-naphthoquinone-imine).

2-Naphthylamine was mutagenic in S. typh -
imurium  strains TA98 and TA100 in the pres -
ence of bovine bladder cells ( Hix et al ., 1983 ). 
2-Naphthylamine-induced DNA damage was 
triggered by an NAT1-overexpressing S. typhimu -
rium  strain, but not by an O -acetyltransferase-
deficient strain, in the presence of human CYP1A2 ( umu  response) ( Oda, 2004 ). In another 
umu  gene-expression assay, DNA damage in 
S. typhimurium  strain NM2009 exposed to 
2-naphthylamine was induced by the CYP4B1 
isoenzyme from rat-bladder epithelium ( Imaoka 
et al ., 1997 ). 2-Naphthylamine was mutagenic 
in Chinese hamster ovary cells in the presence or absence of an exogenous activating system 
(Gupta & Singh, 1982 ).
5. Evaluation
There is sufficient evidence  in humans 
for the carcinogenicity of 2-naphthylamine. 
2-Naphthylamine causes cancer of the urinary 
bladder.
There is sufficient evidence  in experi -
mental animals for the carcinogenicity of 2-naphthylamine.
There is strong mechanistic evidence indi -
cating that the carcinogenicity of 2-naphthyl -
amine operates by a genotoxic mechanism of action that involves metabolic activation, forma -
tion of DNA adducts, and induction of mutagenic and clastogenic effects. Metabolic activation to DNA-reactive intermediates occurs by multiple 
pathways including N -oxidation in the liver, 
O-acetylation in the bladder, and peroxidative 
activation in the mammary gland and other 
organs.

1.2 Uses
ortho -Toluidine is used as an intermediate 
in the synthesis of the large-volume herbicides, 
metolachlor and acetochlor, in the manufacture 
of more than 90 dyes and pigments (e.g. acid-fast dyestuffs, azo pigment dyes, triarylmethane dyes, sulfur dyes, and indigo compounds), and 
as an intermediate for synthetic rubber and 
rubber-vulcanizing chemicals, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and other chemicals. ortho -Toluidine 
is also used in the clinical laboratory as an ingre -
dient in a reagent for glucose analysis, and for tissue staining ( IARC, 2010 ; NTP, 20 04 ).
1.3 Human exposure
1.3.1  Occupational exposure
Occupational exposure to ortho -toluidine 
can occur by inhalation or skin contact during 
its production, or during the production of dyes, 
pigments and rubber chemicals manufactured from this chemical. Laboratory and medical 
personnel may be exposed when using ortho -
toluidine for staining tissues ( IARC, 2010 ).
From the US National Occupational Exposure 
Survey (1981–83) it was estimated that 30000 
workers, including approximately 15500 women, were potentially exposed to ortho -toluidine 
(NIOSH, 1990 ). No estimates of the number of 
exposed workers in the European Union have been reported.ortho -TOLUIDINE
ortho -Toluidine was considered by previous IARC Working Groups in 1977 , 1981, 1987 , 2000, 
and 2008 ( IARC, 1978 , 1982 , 1987 , 2000 , 2010 ). Since that time new data have become avail -
able, which have been incorporated in this Monograph,  and taken into consideration in the 
present evaluation.IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
At a chemical plant in the former Soviet 
Union where ortho -toluidine was produced 
via reduction of ortho -nitrotoluene, workers 
were exposed to concentrations of ortho -
toluidine in the air that generally exceeded 
the maximum permissible concentration [of 
3 mg/m3, IARC (1982) ] by 2–7-fold. In a total 
of 215 air samples, the highest exposure levels 
were observed during distillation and extrac -
tion processes (25–28.6 mg/m3). Dermal expo -
sures also were documented ( Khlebnikova et al ., 
1970 ). Measurements in the 1940s in a US dye-
production plant indicated that the concentra -
tion of ortho -toluidine was < 0.5 ppm [2 mg/m3] 
in the workroom air and in the breathing zone of the workers, and < 0.3–1.7 mg/L in the urine 
of workers engaged in the production of thio-indigo ( Ott & Langner, 1983 ). Exposure to ortho -
toluidine was also reported to occur in plants involved in dye-production in Italy ( Rubino 
et al ., 1982 ), Germany ( Stasik, 1988 ), and the 
USA (New Jersey) ( Delzell et al ., 1989 ), but no 
data on exposure levels were provided.
Concentrations of ortho -toluidine in indoor 
air in plants producing rubber antioxidants or vulcanising rubber articles ranged up to several hundred µg/m
3 and ortho -toluidine concentra -
tions in post-shift urine samples were around 
100 µg/L ( Ward et al ., 1991 ; Teass et al ., 1993 ; 
Ward et al., 1996 ; Korinth et al., 2006 ).
Medical and laboratory personnel also are 
potentially exposed to ortho -toluidine, although 
air concentrations are reportedly low ( EPA, 1984; 
Kauppinen et al., 2003 ).
1.3.2  Non-occupational exposure
Significant non-occupational exposures 
to ortho -toluidine may result from the use of 
some hair dyes, the local anaesthetic prilo -
caine, or tobacco smoke. In a study from Turkey 
(Akyüz & Ata, 2008 ), ortho -toluidine was found 
in 34 of the 54 hair dyes tested, at levels up to 1547 µg/g. Prilocaine, a widely used anaesthetic, is metabolized to ortho -toluidine. In 25 patients who 
received local anaesthesia, the average amount 
of ortho -toluidine adducts to haemoglobin (Hb) 
increased 6–360-fold, from 0.54 ± 0.95 ng/g Hb 
before treatment to 22 ± 13.2 ng/g Hb at 24 hours 
after surgery ( Gaber et al., 2007 ). ortho -Toluidine 
has been measured in mainstream cigarette 
smoke at 9–144 ng per cigarette ( Stabbert et al ., 
2003 ), and concentrations in urine of smokers 
are higher than in non-smokers ( Riffelmann 
et al ., 1995 ; Riedel et al ., 2006 ). ortho -Toluidine 
has also been detected in surface waters and industrial effluents ( Shackelford & Keith, 1976 ; 
Neurath et al ., 1977 ; EPA, 1984; NTP, 20 04 ), in 
vegetables such as kale, celery and carrots, in the volatile aroma of black tea ( Vitzthum et al., 1975 ; 
Neurath et al., 1977 ), and in breast milk ( DeBruin 
et al., 1999 ), but levels are generally very low.
2. Cancer in Humans
Several cohort studies have been conducted 
among workers potentially exposed to 
ortho -toluidine (Table  2.1 available at http://
monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/
vol100F/100F-06-Table2.1.pdf ). Rubino et al . 
(1982)  reported excess bladder-cancer risks in 
relation to ortho -toluidine exposure, however, 
other exposure to potential bladder carcinogens 
also occurred in this work environment. Ward 
et al. (1991)  reported an excess in bladder cancer 
in 1749 US workers employed in the produc -
tion of rubber additives from ortho -toluidine 
and aniline. Risks were greatest for workers 
with the strongest likelihood of exposure and 
for those with long-term exposure (> 10 years). 
Further cases of bladder cancer in this facility were reported by Markowitz & Levin (2004) , but 
rates were not calculated. Exposure to low-level 4-aminobiphenyl was suspected, so a protein-adduct biomarker study was carried out ( Ward 
et al., 1996 ), which supported the conclusion that 
94ortho -Toluidine
ortho -toluidine was the most likely cause of the 
bladder-cancer excess, because 4-aminobiphenyl 
adducts to haemoglobin were unrelated to work 
in the facility. Using revised exposure categories, Carreón et al.  (2010)  conducted a re-analysis of 
the data and confirmed that workers in this plant have an increased risk for bladder cancer.
Sorahan et al . (2000)  and Sorahan (2008)  
reported an excess in bladder-cancer risk in workers exposed to ortho -toluidine in the United 
Kingdom. Sorahan (2008)  found increased risks 
with longer duration of employment in depart -
ments where ortho -toluidine was processed 
(P < 0.05), after adjusting for exposure to other 
bladder carcinogens in the factory. 
Overall, the epidemiological studies show 
consistent associations between exposure to ortho -toluidine and bladder cancer. Although 
exposure to other bladder carcinogens occurred 
for several of the cohorts, the overall evidence 
is consistent with an association of exposure to ortho -toluidine and bladder cancer.
3. Cancer in Experimental Animals
Studies on the carcinogenicity of ortho -tolu -
idine in the mouse, rat and hamster after oral 
administration or subcutaneous injection were 
reviewed in previous IARC Monographs  (IARC, 
2000 , 2010 ). There have been no additional carci -
nogenicity studies in animals reported since the most recent evaluation ( IARC, 2010 ).
ortho -Toluidine was tested for carcinogenicity 
as its hydrochloride salt by oral administration in the feed in two experiments in mice and in three experiments in rats, and as the free base in one 
limited subcutaneous-injection experiment in 
hamsters. Results of adequately conducted carci -
nogenicity studies are summarized in Table 3.1 .
Oral administration of ortho -toluidine to 
male and female mice caused an increased incidence of haemangiomas and haemangio-sarcomas (combined) in both sexes in one study 
(Weisburger et al ., 1978 ). The same result was 
found in male rats in another study, but the 
separate incidence for haemangiosarcomas 
was also increased ( NTP, 1979 ). The incidences 
of hepatocellular carcinomas and of hepato-
cellular adenomas and carcinomas combined 
were increased in females in the latter study 
(NTP, 1979 ).
Oral administration of ortho -toluidine to 
male rats caused an increased incidence of subcu -
taneous fibromas and fibrosarcomas (combined) in one study ( Weisburger et al ., 1978 ), and of 
skin and spleen fibromas, mammary gland fibro-adenomas and peritoneal sarcomas in another (Hecht et al ., 1982 ). In a third study in male and 
female rats, ortho -toluidine increased the inci -
dence of subcutaneous fibromas and of mesothe -
liomas of multiple organs or the tunica vaginalis  
in males, and of mammary gland fibroadenomas and urinary bladder transitional-cell carcinomas in females. An increased incidence of fibro -
sarcomas, angiosarcomas, osteosarcomas or sarcomas (not otherwise specified) (combined) of multiple organs (mainly subcutis and spleen 
or bone) was also observed in both sexes; and a 
significant increase in the incidence of fibrosar -
comas and sarcomas of multiple organs in males, 
and of spleen angiosarcomas and osteosarcomas 
of multiple organs in females ( NTP, 1979 ).
When administered as the free base by subcu -
taneous injection to male and female Syrian golden hamsters, ortho -toluidine produced no 
increase in tumour incidence compared with 
controls ( Hecht et al., 1983 ).

4. Other Relevant Data
A general Section on “Aromatic amines: 
metabolism, genotoxicity, and cancer suscepti -
bility” appears as Section 4.1 in the Monograph  
on 4-aminobiphenyl in this volume.
ortho -Toluidine is a constituent of tobacco 
smoke and it is excreted in larger amounts in the 
urine of smokers than of non-smokers ( Riedel 
et al ., 2006 ). ortho -Toluidine induced urinary 
bladder and mammary gland tumours in rats and liver tumours and haemangiosarcomas in mice. The risk for cancer of the urinary bladder 
was elevated in workers exposed to ortho -tolui -
dine. This substance has been evaluated in a large 
number of genetic toxicology studies ( IARC, 
2010 ); however, there has been much inconsist -
ency in the results reported.
The metabolism of ortho -toluidine has not 
yet been fully characterized, but the available data indicate a preferential ring-oxidation or N-acetylation rather than N -oxidation ( Son et al., 
1980 ). Similarly, cancers of the urinary bladder 
associated with occupational exposure to ortho -
toluidine may result from peroxidative activa -
tion of the chemical, catalysed by prostaglandin H synthase in the epithelium of the urinary bladder ( Zenser et al ., 2002 ). ortho -Toluidine-
haemoglobin adduct levels were increased in patients treated with the anaesthetic prilocaine (Gaber et al ., 2007 ) and in workers employed in 
the rubber chemicals manufacturing area of a chemical plant ( Ward et al ., 1996 ). Metabolites 
are excreted primarily as sulfate or glucuro -
nide conjugates, since ortho -toluidine is not a 
substrate for human NAT1-mediated acetylation (Zhang et al., 2006 ).
ortho -Toluidine induces tumours in rodents 
and DNA lesions in multiple organs. Most studies reported that ortho -toluidine was not 
mutagenic in S. typhimurium , other studies 
showed positive responses in the same strains. The N-oxidized metabolite of ortho -toluidine, N-hydroxy- ortho -toluidine, was mutagenic in S. 
typhimurium  strain TA100 ( Gupta et al ., 1987 ). 
ortho -Toluidine induced intrachromosomal 
recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae  in an 
assay that is responsive to the induction of DNA 
deletions ( Carls & Schiestl, 1994 ); this response 
was reduced in the presence of an antioxi -
dant. Other reported effects of ortho -toluidine 
(Danford, 1991 ) include the induction of sister 
chromatid exchange, aneuploidy, unscheduled 
DNA synthesis, DNA strand breaks, and cell 
transformation in vitro , and the induction of 
micronuclei in peripheral blood of rats treated in 
vivo (Suzuki et al., 2005 ). The formation of 8-oxo-
7,8-dihydro-2’-deoxyguanosine in calf thymus DNA incubated in vitro  with 4-amino-3-methyl -
phenol, a metabolite of ortho -toluidine, suggests 
a potential role of reactive oxygen species in the DNA-damaging effects of this aromatic amine (Ohkuma et al ., 1999 ). ortho -Toluidine induced 
DNA lesions – measured by means of the comet assay – in multiple organs of exposed rats and mice ( Sekihashi et al ., 2002 ): increased DNA 
migration was observed in the liver, bladder, lung, and brain of mice, and in the liver, bladder, and stomach of rats.
5. Evaluation
There is sufficient evidence  in humans for the 
carcinogenicity of ortho- toluidine. ortho- Tolui -
dine causes cancer of the urinary bladder.
There is sufficient evidence  in experi -
mental animals for the carcinogenicity of 
ortho -toluidine. 
There is moderate mechanistic evidence 
indicating that the carcinogenicity of ortho -tolu -
idine involves metabolic activation, formation of 
DNA adducts, and induction of DNA-damaging effects.
ortho -Toluidine is carcinogenic to humans 
(Group 1) .

Auramine is manufactured industrially 
from N,N-dimethylaniline and formaldehyde, 
which react to form Michler’s base (tetramethyl-diaminodiphenylmethane). This base is subse -
quently converted to auramine by heating with 
sulfur and ammonium chloride in the presence 
of ammonia. It was reported that a 98% pure auramine contains salts, water and Michler’s 
ketone, an hydrolysis product ( Kirsch et al ., 
1978 ).
Production of auramine took place first 
in Europe (Switzerland, Germany, the United 
Kingdom, and France), and later also in the United States of America (USA). Production in 
these countries has generally been discontinued. 
Auramine manufacturing is currently mainly located in India and the People’s Republic of 
China.
Auramine colourants are used for dyeing of 
leather, jute, tanned cotton, and paints, and as dye components in inking ribbons, ballpoint 
pastes, oils and waxes, and carbon paper. The most important applications are in paper dyeing 
and flexographic printing ( IARC, 2010 ). More 
detailed information on the use of auramine 
dyes and auramine compounds is provided in 
the recent Monograph  (IARC, 2010 ).AURAMINE AND AURAMINE PRODUCTION 
Auramine and auramine production were considered by previous IARC Working Groups 
in 1971, 1987 , and 2008 ( IARC, 1972 , 1987 , 2010 ). Since that time new data have become 
available, which have been incorporated in this Monograph,  and taken into consideration 
in the present evaluation.IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
1.3 Human exposure
1.3.1  Occupational exposure
The only well described groups of workers 
exposed during auramine production include 
those in the United Kingdom ( Case & Pearson, 
1954 ) and Germany ( Kirsch et al ., 1978 ; Thiess 
et al., 1982 ). Results from exposure measurements 
in the workplace or from biological samples of 
workers employed in the production of auramine are not available.
The manufacture of auramine involves 
potential exposure to its process chemicals (e.g. dimethyl-aniline, formaldehyde, sulfur, ammo -
nium chloride, ammonia, Michler’s base), as well as to other chemicals that may be used and produced at the same location (e.g. benzidine, 
1-naphthylamine, 2-naphthylamine, magenta, 
aniline) ( Case & Pearson, 1954 ).
2. Cancer in Humans
Auramine was last reviewed in IARC  
Monograph  Volume 99 ( IARC, 2010 ). A 13-fold 
excess of bladder tumours was observed among men engaged in the manufacture of auramine (P  <  0.005), compared with mortality rates for 
the male population in England and Wales (Case & Pearson, 1954; see Table  2.1, available 
at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/
vol100F/100F-07-Table2.1.pdf ). Although care 
had been taken to eliminate from the analysis those workers who were recorded as also having 
been in contact with 1- or 2-naphthylamine or 
benzidine, exposure to non-auramine bladder carcinogens could not be entirely excluded. A 
cohort-mortality study of auramine workers at 
the ‘Badische Anilin und Soda-Fabrik’ (BASF) in Germany ( Kirsch et al ., 1978 ) identified two 
bladder cancer deaths, with < 0.4 expected. Case reports of bladder cancer among Swiss auramine-production workers have also been published 
(Von Müller, 1933 ).3. Cancer in Experimental Animals
Studies on the carcinogenicity of auramine in 
the mouse, rat, and rabbit after oral administra -
tion or subcutaneous injection were reviewed in 
previous IARC Monographs  (IARC, 1972 , 1987 , 
2010 ). There have been no additional carcino -
genicity studies in experimental animals reported since the most recent evaluation ( IARC, 2010 ).
Auramine was tested for carcinogenicity by 
oral administration in two experiments in mice, two in rats, one in rabbits, and one in dogs, and by subcutaneous administration in one experiment 
in rats. Results of adequately conducted carcino -
genicity studies are summarized in Table 3.1 .
Oral administration of auramine caused a 
significant increase in the incidence of hepatomas 
in male and female mice and in male rats ( Bonser 
et al ., 1956 ; Williams & Bonser, 1962 ; Walpole, 
1963 ), and of lymphomas in female mice ( Bonser 
et al., 1956 ). The subcutaneous-injection study in 
rats (in which local sarcomas were observed) and 
the oral studies in rabbits and dogs were found to 
be inadequate for the evaluation of the carcino -
genic hazards of auramine.
For data on Michler’s base and Michler’s 
ketone, see IARC (2010) .
4. Other Relevant Data
A general Section on “Aromatic amines: 
metabolism, genotoxicity, and cancer suscepti -
bility” appears as Section 4.1 in the Monograph  
on 4-aminobiphenyl in this volume.
While no studies were found on 
the metabolism of auramine in labora -
tory animals or humans, the finding that auramine-induced intrachromosomal recombi -
nation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae  was reduced 
in the presence of a free-radical scavenger (N-acetylcysteine) suggests that auramine may 
induce genotoxic effects in yeast by generating

Commercial preparations of auramine were 
mutagenic in several strains of S. typhimurium , 
when tested with metabolic activation systems. 
Other in vitro  effects of auramine include induc -
tion of deletions and aneuploidy in Saccharomyces cereviasiae , DNA strand breaks in rat hepato -
cytes, unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat and 
hamster hepatocytes, mutations in Chinese 
hamster ovary cells, and micronucleus formation and transformation of Syrian hamster embryo 
cells. DNA strand breaks were induced in liver, 
kidney, and urinary bladder cells of exposed rats (Parodi et al ., 1982 ; Martelli et al ., 1998 ) and in 
liver and bone-marrow cells of exposed mice (Parodi et al., 1982 ; Sasaki et al., 1997 ).
5. Evaluation

the carcinogenicity of auramine production. 
Auramine production causes cancer of the 
urinary bladder.
There is inadequate evidence  in humans for 
the carcinogenicity of auramine.
There is sufficient evidence  in experimental 
animals for the carcinogenicity of auramine.

relevant to the carcinogenicity of auramine in humans. Auramine induces DNA strand-breaks 
in experimental animals.
Auramine production is carcinogenic to 
humans (Group 1) .
Auramine is possibly carcinogenic to humans 
(Group 2B) .

1041051. Exposure Data
Historically, the dye name Magenta has been 
used to refer to the mixture Basic Fuchsin, with 
its four major constituents Basic Red 9 (Magenta 
0), Magenta I (Rosanilin), Magenta II, and Magenta III (New Fuchsin). Although samples 
of Basic Fuchsin can vary considerably in the 
proportions of these four constituents, today all except Magenta II are available commercially 
under their own name. Of these, Magenta I and 
Basic Red 9 are the most common ( IARC, 2010 ).

1.2 Manufacturing processes
Magenta was among the first synthetic dyes 
to be produced in the 1850s. It has been produced 
commercially in the United States of America 
(USA) since at least 1921 ( IARC, 2010 ).
In the United Kingdom, the process for 
manufacturing Magenta has involved condensa -
tion of ortho -toluidine and formaldehyde in the 
presence of nitrotoluene, resulting mainly in the 
production of Magenta III. Magenta I is prepared 
by the reaction of a mixture of aniline, ortho - and 
106Magenta and magenta production
para -toluidine and their hydrochlorides with 
nitrobenzene or a mixture of nitrobenzene and 
ortho -nitrotoluene in the presence of ferrous 
chloride, ferrous oxide and zinc chloride. CI Basic 
Red 9 is prepared by the reaction of aniline with 
formaldehyde in the presence of hydrogen chlo -
ride, forming 4,4 ′-methylenedianiline, which is 
then heated with aniline and aniline hydrochlo -
ride in the presence of nitrobenzene and ferric 
chloride ( IARC, 2010 ).
1.3 Human exposure
1.3.1 Occupational exposure
The only well described groups of workers 
exposed during magenta production include 
those in a dyestuff-manufacturing plant in 
Ludwigshafen, Germany ( Rehn, 1895 ), in 
the manufacture of magenta in the chemical 
industry in the United Kingdom (1910–52) ( Case 
& Pearson, 1954 ) and the in manufacture of ‘new 
fuchsin’ in an Italian dyestuffs factory ( Rubino 
et al., 1982 ; Piolatto et al., 1991 ). Reported expo -
sures were based on duration of exposure, years 
since first exposure, age at first exposure, job 
category or years since last exposure. No envi -
ronmental or biological measurements have been 
reported for these plants or any other plants 
historically or currently producing magenta.
Production of magenta may involve exposure 
to process chemicals (e.g. aniline, ortho - and 
para -toluidine, and – historically – arsenic acid). 
Exposure to other chemicals used and produced 
at the same location may also occur (e.g. benzi -
dine, 1-naphthylamine, 2-naphthylamine, auramine, aniline) ( Case & Pearson, 1954 ).
2. Cancer in Humans
Magenta production was last reviewed in 
IARC Monograph  Volume 99 ( IARC, 2010 ). A 
23-fold excess of bladder tumours was found in men engaged in the manufacture of magenta (P  <  0.005), compared with mortality rates for 
the male population in England and Wales ( Case 
& Pearson, 1954 ). Although care had been taken 
to eliminate from the analysis those workers who 
were recorded as also having been in contact with 
auramine, 1- or 2-naphthylamine or benzidine, exposure to non-magenta bladder carcinogens 
could not be entirely excluded. Rubino et al. (1982)  
reported two deaths from bladder cancer after 
exposure to magenta in the manufacture of ‘new 
fuchsin’ (Magenta III) (see Table  2.1, available 
at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/
vol100F/100F-08-Table2.1.pdf ). Bladder cancer 
was associated with employment in industries with potential magenta exposure in Torino, Italy (Vineis & Magnani, 1985 ; see Table 2.2, available 
at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/
vol100F/100F-08-Table2.2.pdf ). These studies 
indicate that excess bladder cancer risks are 
caused by the production of magenta, but 
co-exposures preclude a conclusion for magenta itself.
3. Cancer in Experimental Animals
Studies on the carcinogenicity of magenta in 
the mouse, rat, and hamster after oral admin -
istration, and studies on the carcinogenicity of CI Basic Red 9 in these species after oral admin -
istration or subcutaneous injection, have been 
reviewed in previous IARC Monographs  (IARC, 
1974 , 1987b , 1993 , 2010 ). There have been no 
additional carcinogenicity studies in animals reported since the most recent evaluation ( IARC,

(Ketkar & Mohr, 1982 ) and one experiment in 
hamsters ( Green et al., 1979 ). These studies were 
found to be inadequate to evaluate the carcino -
genicity of magenta in experimental animals.
3.2 CI Basic Red 9
CI Basic Red 9 was tested for carcinogenicity 
by oral administration in one study in mice, ( NTP, 
1986 ) in two studies in rats ( Ketkar & Mohr, 1982 ; 
NTP, 1986 ) and one study in hamsters ( Green 
et al ., 1979 ). It has also been tested by subcuta -
neous injection in one study in rats ( Druckrey 
et al ., 1956 ). Only the study by NTP (1986)  was 
adequate to evaluate the carcinogenicity of CI 
Basic Red 9 in experimental animals.
After oral administration in the diet, CI Basic 
Red 9 increased the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas in male and female mice and in male 
rats. It increased the incidence of adrenal gland phaeochromocytomas (benign or malignant) in 
female mice, and of benign (trichoepitheliomas 
and sebaceous adenomas) and malignant (squa -
mous cell carcinomas) skin tumours in male rats. 
In rats, it also increased the incidence of subcu -
taneous fibromas and Zymbal gland carcinomas 
in males and females, of thyroid follicular-cell 
carcinomas in males, and of thyroid follicular-
cell adenomas and carcinomas combined in females ( NTP, 1986 ; Table  3.1 ). In an early 
study, subcutaneous injection of Basic Red 9 (parafuchsin) in rats resulted in a high incidence of local sarcomas ( Druckrey et al ., 1956 ). [The 
Working Group noted that this study lacks detail and has no concurrent controls.]
4. Other Relevant Data
A general Section on “Aromatic amines: 
metabolism, genotoxicity, and cancer suscepti -
bility” appears as Section 4.1 in the Monograph  
on 4-aminobiphenyl in this volume.No studies in laboratory animals or in 
humans were found on the metabolism of 
magenta. No adequate studies were available on 
the carcinogenicity of magenta in experimental animals. However, the related compound CI 
Basic Red 9, which is a component of commercial 
magenta, induced liver tumours in rats and mice. Excess risk for cancer of the urinary bladder was 
reported in workers involved in the manufac -
ture of magenta. Magenta was mutagenic in S. 
typhimurium  strains TA98, TA100, and TA1535 
when tested in the presence of metabolic activa -
tion ( Mortelmans et al., 1986 ).
5. Evaluation
There is sufficient evidence  in humans for the 
carcinogenicity of magenta production. Magenta 
production causes cancer of the urinary bladder.
There is sufficient evidence  in experimental 
animals for the carcinogenicity of CI Basic Red 9.
There are insufficient mechanistic data rele -
vant to the carcinogenicity of magenta in humans 
or experimental animals.
Magenta production is carcinogenic to 
humans (Group 1).
Magenta is possibly carcinogenic to humans 
(Group 2B) .

1.2 Occurrence and exposure
Benzo[ a]pyrene and other polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons (PAHs) are widespread environ -
mental contaminants formed during incomplete combustion or pyrolysis of organic material. These substances are found in air, water, soils and 
sediments, generally at trace levels except near 
their sources. PAHs are present in some foods and in a few pharmaceutical products based on 
coal tar that are applied to the skin. Tobacco 
smoke contains high concentrations of PAHs (IARC, 2010 ).
1.2.1  Exposure of the general population
The general population can be exposed to 
benzo[ a]pyrene through tobacco smoke, ambient 
air, water, soils, food and pharmaceutical prod -
ucts. Concentrations of benzo[ a]pyrene in BENZO[ a]PYRENE
Benzo[ a]pyrene was considered by previous IARC Working Groups in 1972, 1983, and 2005 
(IARC, 1973 , 1983 , 2010 ). Since that time new data have become available, which have been 
incorporated in this Monograph , and taken into consideration in the present evaluation.IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
sidestream cigarette smoke have been reported 
to range from 52 to 95 ng/cigarette — more than 
three times the concentration in mainstream 
smoke. Major sources of PAHs in ambient air (both outdoors and indoors) include residential 
and commercial heating with wood, coal or other 
biomasses (oil and gas heating produce much lower quantities of PAH), other indoor sources 
such as cooking and tobacco smoke, and outdoor 
sources like motor-vehicle exhaust (especially from diesel engines), industrial emissions and 
forest fires. Average concentrations of individual 
PAHs in the ambient air in urban areas typically range from 1 to 30 ng/m
3; however, concentra -
tions up to several tens of nanograms per cubic 
metre have been reported in road tunnels, or 
in large cities that make extensive use of coal or other biomass as residential heating fuel. 
Estimates of PAH intake from food vary widely, 
ranging from a few nanograms to a few micro -
grams per person per day. Sources of PAHs in 
the diet include barbecued/grilled/broiled and 
smoke-cured meats; roasted, baked and fried foods (high-temperature processing); bread, 
cereals and grains (at least in part from gas/
flame-drying of grains); and vegetables grown in contaminated soils, or in areas with surface 
contamination from atmospheric PAH fall-out 
(IARC, 2010 ).
1.2.2  Occupational exposure
Occupational exposure to PAHs occurs 
primarily through inhalation and via skin 
contact. Monitoring by means of ambient 
air-sampling or personal air-sampling at the workplace, to determine individual PAHs, sets 
of PAHs or surrogates (e.g. coal-tar pitch vola -
tiles) has been used to characterize exposure via 
inhalation; more recently, biological monitoring 
methods have been applied to characterize the 
uptake of certain specific PAHs (e.g. benzo[ a]
pyrene) to be used as biomarkers of total expo -
sure ( IARC, 2010 ).Industries where occupational exposure to 
benzo[ a]pyrene has been measured and reported 
include: coal liquefaction, coal gasification, coke production and coke ovens, coal-tar distillation, roofing and paving (involving coal-tar pitch), 
wood impregnation/preservation with creosote, 
aluminium production (including anode manu -
facture), carbon-electrode manufacture, chimney 
sweeping, and power plants. Highest levels of 
exposure to PAHs are observed in aluminium production (Söderberg process) with values up 
to 100 μg/m
3. Mid-range levels are observed in 
roofing and paving (e.g. 10−20 μg/m3) and the 
lowest concentrations (i.e. at or below 1μg/m3) 
are observed in coal liquefaction, coal-tar distil -
lation, wood impregnation, chimney sweeping 
and power plants ( IARC, 2010 ).
2. Cancer in Humans
No epidemiological data on benzo[ a]pyrene 
alone were available to the Working Group.
3. Cancer in Experimental Animals
Benzo[ a]pyrene was considered by three 
previous Working Groups ( IARC, 1973 , 1983 , 
2010 ).
In IARC Monograph  Volume 3 ( IARC, 
1973 ) it was concluded that benzo[ a]pyrene 
produced tumours in all species tested (mouse, rat, hamster, guinea-pig, rabbit, duck, newt, monkey) for which data were reported following 
exposure by many different routes (oral, dermal, 
inhalation, intratracheal, intrabronchial, subcu -
taneous, intraperitoneal, intravenous). Benzo[ a]
pyrene had both a local and a systemic carcino -
genic effect, was an initiator of skin carcinogen -
esis in mice, and was carcinogenic in single-dose 
studies and following prenatal and transplacental 
exposures.
112Benzo[ a]pyrene
In IARC Monograph  Volume 32 ( IARC, 1983 ) 
no evaluation was made of studies of carcino -
genicity in experimental animals published since 
1972, but it was concluded that there is sufficient evidence  for the carcinogenicity of benzo[ a]
pyrene in experimental animals.
Carcinogenicity studies with administra -
tion of benzo[ a]pyrene by multiple route of 
exposure, reported after the initial evaluations, were subsequently reviewed in IARC Monograph  
Volume 92 ( IARC, 2010 ) and are summarized 
below ( Table 3.1 ). See Table 3.2  for an overview of 
malignant tumours induced in different animal species.
3.1 Skin application
In several studies in which benzo[ a]pyrene 
was applied to the skin of different strains of mice, 
benign (squamous cell papillomas and kerato-
acanthomas) and malignant (mainly squamous-cell carcinomas) skin tumours were observed 
(Van Duuren et al ., 1973 ; Cavalieri et al ., 1977 , 
1988a ; Levin et al ., 1977 ; Habs et al ., 1980 , 1984 ; 
Warshawsky & Barkley, 1987 ; Albert et al ., 1991 ; 
Andrews et al ., 1991 ; Warshawsky et al ., 1993 ). 
No skin-tumour development was seen in AhR
−/− 
mice that lacked the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, whereas the heterozygous and wild-type mice 
developed squamous-cell carcinomas of the skin (Shimizu et al., 2000 ).
In a large number of initiation–promotion 
studies in mice, benzo[ a]pyrene was active as an 
initiator (mainly of squamous-cell papillomas) 
when applied to the skin ( IARC, 2010 ).
3.2 Subcutaneous injection
In subcutaneous injection studies of benzo[ a]
pyrene, malignant tumours (mainly fibro-sarcomas) were observed at the injection site in 
mice ( Kouri et al., 1980 ; Rippe & Pott, 1989 ) and 
rats ( Pott et al., 1973a , b; Rippe & Pott, 1989 ). No 
fibrosarcomas were observed in AhR
−/− mice that lacked the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, whereas the heterozygous and wild-type mice did develop 
these tumours ( Shimizu et al., 2000 ).
In another study, male and female newborn 
Swiss mice that were given benzo[ a]pyrene 
subcutaneously showed a significant increase 
in lung-adenoma incidence and multiplicity (Balansky et al., 2007 ).
A single study in 12 strains of hamsters 
resulted in sarcomas at the site of injection in both sexes of all 12 strains ( Homburger et al ., 
1972 ).
3.3 Oral administration
After administration of benzo[ a]pyrene by 
gavage or in the diet to mice of different strains 
(Sparnins et al ., 1986 ; Estensen & Wattenberg, 
1993 ; Weyand et al ., 1995 ; Kroese et al ., 1997 ; 
Culp et al ., 1998 ; Hakura et al ., 1998 ; Badary 
et al ., 1999 ; Wijnhoven et al ., 2000 ; Estensen 
et al ., 2004 ), increased tumour responses were 
observed in lymphoid and haematopoeitic tissues and in several organs, including the lung, 
forestomach, liver, oesophagus and tongue.
Oral administration of benzo[ a]pyrene to 
XPA
–/– mice resulted in a significantly higher 
increase of lymphomas than that observed 
in similarly treated XPA+/– and XPA+/+ mice 
(de V ries et al ., 1997 ). Benzo[ a]pyrene given by 
gavage to XPA–/–/p53+/– double-transgenic mice 
induced tumours (mainly splenic lymphomas and forestomach tumours) much earlier and at 
higher incidences than in similarly treated single transgenic and wild-type counterparts. These 
cancer-prone XPA
–/– or XPA–/–/p53+/– mice also 
developed a high incidence of tumours (mainly of the forestomach) when fed benzo[ a]pyrene in 
the diet ( van O ostrom et al ., 1999 ; Hoogervorst 
et al., 2003 ).
Oral administration of benzo[ a]pyrene by 
gavage to rats resulted in an increased incidence of 
mammary gland adenocarcinomas ( el-Bayoumy 
et al., 1995 ).

3.4 Intraperitoneal injection
In a series of studies in newborn and adult 
mice, intraperitoneal injection of benzo[ a]pyrene 
increased the incidence of liver (adenomas and 
carcinomas) and lung (adenomas and adenocar -
cinomas) tumours and, occasionally, forestomach 
(squamous cell papillomas and carcinomas) and 
lymphoreticular tumours ( Vesselinovitch et al ., 
1975a , b; Wislocki et al., 1986 ; Lavoie et al., 1987 ; 
Busby et al ., 1989 ; Rippe & Pott, 1989 ; Mass 
et al., 1993 ; Nesnow et al., 1995 ; Ross et al., 1995 ; 
Weyand et al ., 1995 ; Rodriguez et al ., 1997 ; Von 
Tu ngeln et al., 1999 ).
In one study in rats with a single intraperito -
neal injection of benzo[ a]pyrene, a high incidence 
of abdominal mesotheliomas and sarcomas was observed ( Roller et al., 1992 ).
3.5 Inhalation
In a lifetime inhalation study (Thyssen et al., 
1981 ) in male hamsters, benzo[ a]pyrene induced 
dose-related increases in the incidence of papil -
lomas and squamous-cell carcinomas in both the upper respiratory tract (nose, larynx and trachea) and the upper digestive tract (pharynx, 
oesophagus and forestomach).3.6 Intrapulmonary injection
Dose-related increases in the incidence of 
malignant lung tumours (mainly epidermoid and squamous-cell carcinomas and a few pleo -
morphic sarcomas) were found after injection of 
benzo[ a]pyrene into the lung of rats ( Deutsch-
Wenzel et al., 1983 ; Iwagawa et al., 1989 ; Wenzel-
Hartung et al., 1990 ; Horikawa et al., 1991 ).
3.7 Intratracheal administration
Intratracheal administration of benzo[ a]
pyrene alone or mixed with particulates and 
suspended in saline with or without suspendents 
resulted in benign and malignant respiratory tumours in mice ( Heinrich et al ., 1986a ), rats 
(Pott et al ., 1987 ; Steinhoff et al ., 1991 ) and in 
numerous studies in hamsters ( IARC, 2010 ). This 
treatment also induced forestomach tumours in 
hamsters ( Saffiotti et al ., 1972 ; Sellakumar et al ., 
1973 ; Smith et al., 1975a , b, Stenbäck & Rowland, 
1979 ). Larger benzo[ a]pyrene particles were 
generally more effective than smaller ones.
Mice that lack the nucleotide excision-repair 
gene XPA  (XPA
–/– mice) showed a stronger lung-
tumour response after intratracheal instillation 
of benzo[ a]pyrene than did their similarly treated 
XPA+/+ and XPA+/– counterparts ( Ide et al., 2000 ).

3.8 Buccal pouch application
Repeated application of benzo[ a]pyrene to the 
buccal pouch mucosa of male hamsters resulted 
in a high incidence of forestomach papillomas 
(Solt et al., 1987 ).
3.9 Subcutaneous tracheal grafts 
transplantation
In one study conducted in rats transplanted 
with subcutaneous rat tracheal grafts exposed to 
beeswax pellets containing various amounts of 
benzo[ a]pyrene, a high incidence of squamous-
cell carcinomas was reported ( Nettesheim et al ., 
1977 ).
3.10 Intramammilary administration
In three studies in rats, benign and malig -
nant mammary gland tumours developed 
after intrammilary injection of benzo[ a]pyrene 
(Cavalieri et al., 1988a , b, 1991 ).
3.11 Intracolonic instillation
In three experiments in mice, intraco -
lonic instillation of benzo[ a]pyrene induced 
lymphomas and a variety of benign and malig -
nant tumours in various organs including the 
forestomach ( Tot h, 1980 ; Anderson et al., 1983 ).
3.12 Intravaginal application
Intravaginal application of benzo[ a]pyrene 
in mice produced invasive cervical carcinoma; 
no such tumours were seen in controls ( Näslund 
et al., 1987 ).3.13 Intrafetal injection
In one study in male and female Swiss mice, 
intrafetal injection of benzo[ a]pyrene produced 
lung adenomas ( Rossi et al., 1983 ).
4. Other Relevant Data
Benzo[ a]pyrene is a carcinogen that induces 
tumours in many animal species. Some of the examples relevant for this review are: lung 
tumours in mice, rats, and hamsters; skin tumours in mice; liver tumours in mice; forestomach 
tumours in mice and hamsters; and mammary 
gland tumours in rats ( Osborne & Crosby, 1987 ; 
IARC, 2010 ). In humans, occupational exposures 
to benzo[ a]pyrene-containing mixtures have 
been associated with a series of cancers: coke production: lung; coal gasification: lung, bladder; 
paving and roofing: lung; coal tar distillation: 
skin; soots: lung, oesophagus, haematolymphatic system, skin; aluminum smelting: lung, bladder; 
tobacco smoking: lung, lip, oral cavity, pharynx, 
oesophagus, larynx, bladder ( IARC, 1984 , 1985 , 
1986 , 2010 ).
Studies on the mechanisms of action of 
benzo[ a]pyrene have been reviewed ( Xue & 
Warshawsky, 2005 ; IARC, 2010 ).
4.1 Metabolism
Benzo[ a]pyrene is metabolized by both phase-I 
and phase-II enzymes to form a series of arene 
oxides, dihydrodiols, phenols, and quinones and 
their polar conjugates with glutathione, sulfate, and glucuronide ( Osborne & Crosby, 1987 ). 
Benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-diol is a key metabolite that 
is formed by the action of epoxide hydrolase on benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-epoxide. This dihydrodiol 
can be further metabolized by cytochrome P450s (CYPs) to a series of benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-diol-
9,10-epoxides, which form one class of ultimate 
carcinogenic metabolites of benzo[ a]pyrene. 
131IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
Both CYPs and peroxidases (e.g. prostaglandin-H 
synthase) can oxidize benzo[ a]pyrene. The major 
cytochrome P450s involved in the formation of diols and diolepoxides are CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and CYP1B1 ( Eling et al ., 1986 ; Shimada, 2006 ). 
Cytochrome P450s are inducible by benzo[ a]
pyrene and other PAHs through binding to the aryl hydrocarbon-receptor (AhR) nuclear 
complex, leading to changes in gene transcrip -
tion of CYPs and phase-II enzymes. Mice lacking 
the AhR receptor are refractory to benzo[ a]
pyrene-induced tumorigenesis ( Shimizu et al ., 
2000 ). Both CYPs and peroxidases can form 
radical cations by one-electron oxidation. These 
cations comprise another class of ultimate carci -
nogenic metabolites ( Cavalieri & Rogan, 1995 ). 
Some polymorphisms in human CYPs and phase-II enzymes (glutathione S -transferases, 
uridine 5′-diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases 
and sulfotransferases modulate susceptibility to cancer ( Shimada, 2006 ). In another meta -
bolic pathway, benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol 
is oxidized to benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-quinone by 
enzymes of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR1) 
family. Among these, gene polymorphisms that influence susceptibility have been iden -
tified. NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) catalyses the reduction of benzo[ a]
pyrene quinones to hydroquinones, which may 
be re-oxidized and generate reactive oxygen 
species. Polymorphisms in this gene have also been described ( Penning & Drury, 2007 ; IARC, 
2010 ).
The current understanding of mechanisms 
underlying benzo[ a]pyrene-induced carcino -
genesis in experimental animals is almost solely based on two complementary pathways: those of the diolepoxides and the radical cations. Each 
provides a different explanation for the effects 
observed in experimental animals in specific tissues.4.2 Diolepoxide mechanism
The diolepoxide mechanism for benzo[ a]
pyrene features a sequence of metabolic trans -
formations: benzo[ a]pyrene → benzo[ a]pyrene-
7,8-oxide (by CYP1A1 and CYP1B1) → benzo[ a]
pyrene-7,8-diol (by epoxide hydrolase) → benzo[ a]
pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxides (by CYP1A1 and CYP1B1) ( Xue & Warshawsky, 2005 ). Each class 
of metabolic intermediate has been shown to be 
genotoxic and carcinogenic ( Osborne & Crosby, 
1987 ). The stereochemistry of the metabolic 
transformation of benzo[ a]pyrene to diols and 
diolepoxides is an important component of this 
mechanism of action. Due to the creation of chiral carbons during the metabolic conversions, 
many of the metabolic intermediates of benzo[ a]
pyrene have multiple streochemical forms (enan -
tiomeric and diastereomeric). As the metabolism proceeds the complexity of the stereo-chemical 
forms increases, eventually leading to four benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxides [(+)- and 
(-)-anti, (+)- and (-)- syn]. Diolepoxides react 
with DNA, mainly with the purines, deoxy -
guanosine and deoxyadenosine, and each diol-
epoxide can form both cis  and trans  adducts thus 
giving a total of 16 possible benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-
diol-9,10-epoxide DNA adducts. However, in most cases far fewer DNA adducts are actually 
observed. The most ubiquitous benzo[ a]pyrene 
adduct detected in isolated mammalian DNA 
after metabolic conversion in metabolically 
competent mammalian cells in culture, or in mammals, is the N
2-deoxyguanosine adduct, 
(+)- N2-10S-(7 R,8S,9R-trihydroxy-7,8,9,10-
tetrahydrobenzo[ a]pyrene)-yl)-2’-deoxy-
guanosine (BPDE-deoxyguanosine), derived from 7 R,8S-dihydroxy-9 R,10R-epoxy-7,8,9,10-
tetrahydrobenzo[ a]pyrene ( anti-benzo[ a]pyrene-
7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide, or BPDE). This adduct was first fully identified after isolation from benzo[ a]
pyrene-treated human and bovine bronchial 
explants ( Jeffrey et al ., 1977 ). This diolepoxide 
is considered to be an ultimate, DNA-reactive, 
132Benzo[ a]pyrene
metabolite of benzo[ a]pyrene ( Osborne & 
Crosby, 1987 ). The anti-benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-
diol-9,10-epoxide can form both stable and 
unstable (so-called ‘depurinating’) adducts with DNA, mediated by electrophilic carbonium 
ions ( Chakravarti et al ., 2008 ). In vivo , anti-
benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-oxide produces 
stable adducts that were formed primarily with guanines in many species and organs ( IARC, 
2010 ).
Mice treated with benzo[ a]pyrene had 
anti-benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide-
N
2-deoxyguanosine adducts in their lung tissue, 
while the lung tumours induced by benzo[ a]
pyrene had G→T and G→A mutations in the 
Ki-Ras gene at codon 12 ( Mass et al ., 1993 ). In 
mice treated with benzo[ a]pyrene the major 
stable DNA adduct in the epidermis was the anti-benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-oxide-deoxy -
guanosine adduct ( Melendez-Colon et al., 1999 ). 
Skin tumours from benzo[ a]pyrene-treated mice 
or in preneoplastic skin from benzo[ a]pyrene-
treated mice had G→T mutations in codon 13 and 
A→T mutations in codon 61 of the Ha- Ras gene 
(Chakravarti et al., 2008 ).
Benzo[ a]pyrene-induced skin tumours 
harboured G→T transversion mutations in the 
Tp53  tumour-suppressor gene ( Ruggeri et al ., 
1993 ). The anti-benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-
oxide-DNA adducts occurred at guanine posi -
tions in codons 157, 248, and 273 of the TP53  gene 
in anti-benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide-
treated human HeLa cells. The same positions are the major mutational hotspots found in human lung cancers ( Denissenko et al., 1996 ).
4.3 Radical-cation mechanism
The radical-cation mechanism for benzo[ a]
pyrene has been studied exclusively in connec -
tion with mouse-skin tumorigenesis ( Cavalieri & 
Rogan, 1995 ). One-electron oxidation of benzo[ a]
pyrene by CYPs or peroxidases creates a radical 
cation localized on carbon 6, as a consequence of the ionization potential and geometric configu -
ration. In mouse skin, this radical cation gives rise to the formation of covalent adducts with 
guanine (at the C8 carbon and N7 nitrogen) and adenine (at the N7 nitrogen). These adducts are 
unstable and are thought to generate apurinic 
sites in mouse skin. However, only low levels of apurinic sites were measured in the epidermis 
of mice treated with benzo[ a]pyrene ( Melendez-
Colon et al ., 1999 ) and no studies to date have 
shown an increase in the number of apurinic sites in lung tissues treated with benzo[ a]pyrene. In 
two in vivo  studies, rats treated intraperitoneally 
with benzo[ a]pyrene were shown to excrete 
7-(benzo[ a]pyrene-6-yl)- N7-guanine in faeces 
and urine, while the same adduct was detected in 
lung tissue of mice treated intraperitoneally with 
benzo[ a]pyrene ( Rogan et al ., 1990 ; Banasiewicz 
et al., 2004 ). Skin papillomas obtained from mice 
treated topically with benzo[ a]pyrene showed 
mutations (at guanine and/or adenine) at codons 
12, 13 and 61 in the Ha- Ras oncogene ( Wei et al., 
1999 ). Similar studies in preneoplastic skin from 
benzo[ a]pyrene-treated mice showed Ha- Ras 
mutations at codons 13 and 61 ( Chakravarti 
et al ., 2008 ). The anti-benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-diol-
9,10-epoxide can also form depurinating DNA adducts at guanine and adenine (at the N7 nitrogen). The distribution and chemical nature 
of the depurinating adducts (from both radical-
cation and diolepoxide intermediates) in mouse skin and the distribution and chemical nature of 
the specific benzo[ a]pyrene-induced mutations 
in mouse-skin papillomas have been reported 
(Chakravarti et al., 2008 ).
4.4 Other activation mechanisms of 
benzo[ a]pyrene
4.4.1  Meso-region mechanism
The mechanism of meso-region biomethyl-
ation and benzylic oxidation features biomethyl-
ation of benzo[ a]pyrene to 6-methylbenzo[ a]
133IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
pyrene, with S -adenosylmethione as the carbon 
donor ( Flesher et al ., 1982 ). This process has 
been shown to occur in vitro , and in vivo  in rat 
liver ( Stansbury et al ., 1994 ). 6-Methylbenzo[ a]
pyrene is further metabolized by CYPs to 
6-hydroxymethylbenzo[ a]pyrene ( Flesher 
et al ., 1997 ) and then conjugated to sulfate 
by 3 ′-phosphoadenosine-5 ′-phosphosulfate 
sulfotransferase to 6-[(sulfooxy)methyl]-
benzo[ a]pyrene. This reactive sulfate ester forms 
DNA adducts in vivo  (Stansbury et al ., 1994 ). 
These benzo[ a]pyrene-DNA adducts have only 
been measured in rat liver ( Surh et al ., 1989 ), 
which is not a target for benzo[ a]pyrene-induced 
carcinogenesis. There is no evidence to date that this mechanism operates in lung.
4.4.2  Mechanism via formation of ortho-
quinone/ reactive oxygen species
This mechanism features enzymatic oxidation 
of benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-diol to the ortho -quinone, 
benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-quinone, by aldo-keto 
reductases ( Mangal et al., 2009 ). Benzo[ a]pyrene-
7,8-quinone can react with DNA to yield both 
stable and depurinating DNA adducts in vitro  
(McCoull et al ., 1999 ; Balu et al ., 2006 ) and can 
also undergo repetitive redox cycling which generates reactive oxygen species that damage 
DNA ( Penning et al ., 1999 ). In human A549 
lung-tumour cells benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-quinone 
increased the formation of 8-oxo-deoxyguano -
sine and DNA strand-breaks ( Park et al ., 2008 ; 
Mangal et al ., 2009 ). In a yeast reporter-assay, 
benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-quinone (in the presence of 
redox cycling) induced 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine formation and G→T transversions in the Tp53  
tumour-suppressor gene. The mutational spectra induced in the yeast reporter-assay closely matched those seen in DNA from human lung 
tumours ( Shen et al., 2006 ). Benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-
quinone inhibited the activity of protein kinase 
C in MCF-7 cell lysates suggesting an ability to 
alter cell signalling ( Yu et al., 2002 ). Rats treated with benzo[ a]pyrene showed increased urinary 
concentrations of 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine, but lower levels in liver and lung tissues. This 
suggested that reactive oxygen species are gener -
ated during the CYP-dependent metabolism of 
benzo[ a]pyrene, but induction of DNA-repair 
mechanisms may reduce these levels in target 
tissues ( Briedé et al ., 2004 ). To date this mecha -
nism has been studied only in in-vitro systems.
It is noted that formation of reactive oxygen 
species is not limited to the redox cycling of 
the ortho -quinone of benzo[ a]pyrene (benzo[ a]
pyrene-7,8-quinone). There are several other 
sources of benzo[ a]pyrene-induced reactive 
oxygen species. In vivo , both mice and rats 
metabolize benzo[ a]pyrene to benzo[ a]pyrene-
1,6-quinone, benzo[ a]pyrene-3,6-quinone 
and benzo[ a]pyrene-6,12-quinone and these 
quinones enter into redox cycling and induce mutations ( Osborne & Crosby, 1987 ; Joseph & 
Jaiswal, 1998 ). Many of the reactive intermedi -
ates of benzo[ a]pyrene (oxides, diol-epoxides, 
radical cations) and quinone-generated reactive 
oxygen species can disrupt the balance of cellular 
oxidants and anti-oxidants by reducing the anti-oxidant levels thus leading to an imbalance and 
an excess of reactive oxygen species.
4.4.3  Aryl hydrocarbon-receptor mechanism
The AhR regulates the transcription of 
a series of genes including Cyp1A1 , Cyp1A2, 
Nqo1 , Aldh3a1  (encoding aldehyde dehydro -
genase 3A1), UGT1a6  (uridine 5 ′-diphosphate-
glucuronosyl transferase), and Gsta1  (glutathione 
S-transferase A1). All these genes are activated by 
AhR-ligands, including benzo[ a]pyrene, via the 
AhR-mediated aromatic hydrocarbon response element. The AhR plays a role in the response to 
oxidative stress in cell-cycle regulation and apop -
tosis. In addition, the CYP1A1/1A2-mediated 
metabolism generates oxidative stress ( Nebert 
et al ., 2000 ). Mitochondrial hydrogen-peroxide 
production was induced by an AhR-ligand in 
134Benzo[ a]pyrene
wild-type mice but not in AhR−/− knockout mice 
(Senft et al ., 2002 ). These mice were shown to 
be refractory to benzo[ a]pyrene-induced carci -
nogenicity ( Shimizu et al ., 2000 ). Benzo[ a]
pyrene induced oxidative stress in mouse lung 
(Rajendran et al., 2008 ).
4.4.4  Immunosuppression mechanism
Benzo[ a]pyrene induces immunosupres -
sion in adult mice by altering the cell-mediated responses ( Wojdani & Alfred, 1984 ). Immune 
development in offspring is also altered 
following in utero  exposure to benzo[ a]pyrene 
(Urso & Gengozian, 1984 ). It is postulated that 
PAHs, including benzo[ a]pyrene, act princi -
pally through their AhR-mediated CYP-derived 
metabolites (diolepoxides, quinones) to activate 
oxidative and electrophilic signalling pathways in lymphoid and nonlymphoid cells, including 
myeloid cells, epithelial cells, and other cell 
types. Furthermore, there is evidence that PAHs suppress immunity by p53-dependent path -
ways, by modulating signalling pathways in lymphocytes via non-genotoxic mechanisms, and by oxidative stress ( Burchiel & Luster, 2001 ).
4.4.5  Epigenetic mechanisms
Benzo[ a]pyrene and/or its metabolites have 
been shown to increase cell proliferation in several 
human cell lines, including terminally differenti -
ated human bronchial squamous epithelial cells 
and in lung-cancer cells where increased expres -
sion of the Cdc25B  gene (cell-division cycle 
25B) was observed, along with reduced phos -
phorylation of Cdk1 (cyclin-dependent kinase 
1) (Oguri et al ., 2003 ). Treatment with benzo[ a]
pyrene increased the number of human embryo 
lung-fibroblasts in the G1–S transition via the 
activation of c-Jun, through the p53-dependent 
PI-3K/Akt/ERK (phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase β/extracellular signal-regulated 
kinase) pathway ( Jiao et al., 2008 ).Benzo[ a]pyrene and/or its metabolites also 
affect apoptosis. Benzo[ a]pyrene induced apop -
tosis in human MRC-5 lung fibroblasts via the 
JNK1/FasL (c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1/Fas Ligand) and JNK1/p53 signalling pathways ( Chen 
et al., 2005 ). Apoptosis induced by anti-benzo[ a]
pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide in H460 human lung-cancer cells was associated with induction 
of Bak (BCL2-antagonist/killer) and with activa -
tion of caspase, but it was independent of Bcl-2 
(Xiao et al., 2007 ).
Altered DNA methylation has been reported 
to be associated with exposure to benzo[ a]
pyrene and/or its metabolites. After treatment 
of immortalized bronchial epithelial cells with 
anti-benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide, the 
concentration of cytosine-DNA methyltrans -
ferase-1 was increased and was associated with hypermethylation of the promoters of 5–10 genes, including members of the cadherin gene-family 
(Damiani et al., 2008 ).
4.5 Human exposure to PAH-rich 
mixtures
4.5.1  Biomarkers of exposure and effect
Molecular-epidemiological studies of cancer 
associated with occupational and environmental 
exposures to PAH have provided biomarkers that 
may be used to estimate internal exposure as well as to inform about molecular mechanisms that 
may be relevant to cancer causation, particularly 
in defining the early events in the carcinogen -
esis process. Biomarkers can be detected in the 
target organ, in surrogate tissues, or in tumours. 
These can be categorized into biomarkers of exposure , which are generally specific to the 
PAH of concern (e.g. DNA or protein adducts), biomarkers of effect (e.g. genotoxic and cytoge -
netic effects, 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine, sister 
chromatid exchange (SCE), micronuclei, chro -
mosomal aberrations, mutations in oncogenes, 
tumour-suppressor genes, or indicator genes), 
135IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
and biomarkers of susceptibility  (DNA-repair 
enzymes, e.g. XPA, XPC – xeroderma pigmen -
tosum  complementation groups A and C), bioac -
tivation enzymes (e.g. CYPs), detoxification 
enzymes (e.g. GSTs), and mutagenic metabolites 
in urine ( Kalina et al ., 1998 ; Pilger et al ., 2000 ; 
Simioli et al., 2004 ; Raimondi et al., 2005 ; Vineis 
& Husgafvel-Pursiainen, 2005 ; Matullo et al ., 
2006 ; Farmer & Singh, 2008 ; Gyorffy et al., 2008 ). 
Although biomarkers of effect and suscepti -
bility are generally not unique to any specific PAH exposure, several these biomarkers may 
provide insight into the mechanism of carcino -
genesis induced in humans by PAHs or PAH-rich 
exposures.
4.5.2  Exposure to benzo[a]pyrene and 
relationship with specific biomarkers
Biomarkers of exposure to complex mixtures 
that contain benzo[ a]pyrene have been studied in 
populations exposed in industrial settings: coke 
production, coal-tar distillation, the aluminium industry, roofing and paving with coal-tar 
pitch, coal gasification, chimney sweeping, and 
iron and steel founding. Most if not all of these biomarkers are genotoxic markers. Populations 
of patients who undergo coal-tar therapy and 
groups exposed to combustion emissions, and tobacco smokers have also been evaluated. 
Studies on biomarkers of exposure are dominated 
by those focusing on the anti-benzo[ a]pyrene-
7,8-diol-9,10-oxide-DNA adduct, the most 
commonly studied PAH-DNA adduct because 
of the availability of specific analytical methods and standards ( Gyorffy et al., 2008 ). In one study 
the depurinating adducts resulting from radical-cation formation, viz . 7-(benzo[ a]pyrene-6-yl)
guanine and 7-(benzo[ a]pyrene-6-yl)adenine 
were found in the urine of women exposed to coal smoke ( Casale et al ., 2001 ). Concomitantly, 
several biomarkers of effect have also been evalu -
ated in these studies: chromosomal aberrations, sister chromatid exchange ( Kalina et al ., 1998 ), DNA damage (measured by the comet assay) and 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine formation ( Marczynski 
et al ., 2002 ). It is important to note that these 
genotoxic effects observed in humans in rela -
tion to exposure to benzo[ a]pyrene-containing 
mixtures have also been observed in experi -
mental studies where benzo[ a]pyrene or anti-
benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide has been 
shown to induce sister chromatid exchange (Pal et al ., 1980 ; Brauze et al ., 1997 ), chromo -
somal aberrations, micronuclei ( Kliesch et al ., 
1982 ), DNA damage ( Nesnow et al ., 2002 ), and 
8-oxo-deoxyguanosine ( Thaiparambil et al ., 
2007 ). Tobacco smoke, dietary habits and indoor 
ambient air are also important sources of expo -
sure to benzo[ a]pyrene, which has been impli -
cated as one of the components of tobacco smoke 
related to the induction of lung cancer in smokers 
(Watanabe et al ., 2009 ). In a large study of 585 
smokers and nonsmokers, smoking and diet were 
highly correlated with anti-benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-
diol-9,10-oxide-DNA adduct levels ( Pavanello 
et al ., 2006 ). Several studies have demonstrated 
moderately increased levels of 8-oxo-deoxy-
guanosine from lungs, sperm, and leukocytes of smokers. Increased urinary excretion of 8-oxo-
deoxyguanosine has also been reported ( Hecht, 
1999 ). In rats exposed to benzo[ a]pyrene via oral, 
intratracheal and dermal routes, anti-benzo[ a]
pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-oxide-DNA adducts were 
formed in white blood cells independently of the exposure route and their numbers correlated 
with those found in lung DNA, suggesting that 
anti-benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-oxide-DNA-
adduct levels in white blood cells may be used as 
a surrogate for pulmonary anti-benzo[ a]pyrene-
7,8-diol-9,10-oxide-DNA adducts ( Godschalk 
et al., 2000 ).
136Benzo[ a]pyrene
4.5.3  Relationship of biomarkers to human 
cancer
Mutations in TP53  are common in lung cancers 
from smokers and less common in nonsmokers. 
These mutations are G→T transversions with 
hotspots in codons 157, 248 and 273 ( Hainaut 
& Pfeifer, 2001 ; Pfeifer et al ., 2002 ) and they are 
associated with anti-benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-diol-
9,10-oxide-DNA adducts. The active metabolite anti-benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-oxide causes 
a unique spectrum of TP53  mutations distinct 
from those found in cancers that are not associ -
ated with smoking ( Campling & el-Deiry, 2003 ). 
Similar G→T mutations have been reported in lung tumours from nonsmoking Chinese women whose tumours were associated with exposure to 
PAHs from smoke generated by burning smoky 
coal in unventilated homes. The mutations were clustered at the CpG rich codons 153–158 of the 
TP53  gene, and at codons 249 and 273. The muta -
tion spectrum was fully consistent with exposure 
to PAHs ( DeMarini et al., 2001 ).
4.6 Synthesis
Benzo[ a]pyrene is metabolically activated 
to a series of reactive intermediates by CYP450 
and related enzymes under control of the aryl-
hydrocarbon receptor. There is strong evidence that the benzo[ a]pyrene diolepoxide mecha -
nism operates in mouse-lung tumorigenesis, while there is also strong evidence that both the radical-cation and the diolepoxide mechanisms 
are involved in mouse-skin carcinogenesis. The 
meso-region mechanism has been studied only in rat liver, while the mechanism that involves 
the formation of ortho -quinone/reactive oxygen 
species has only been studied in vitro , although 
reactive oxygen species can be formed in vivo  by 
other benzo[ a]pyrene-mediated mechanisms. All 
these pathways reflect genotoxic mechanisms, as 
they involve alterations to DNA. Benzo[ a]pyrene 
is pleotropic and has the ability to affect many cell- and organ-based systems. Therefore, there are probably many modes of carcinogenic action 
operating to different extents in vivo . These 
include mechanisms that involve AhR, oxidative 
stress, immunotoxicity and epigenetic events.
Based on the best available, consistent and 
strong experimental and human mechanistic evidence it is concluded that benzo[ a]pyrene 
contributes to the genotoxic and carcinogenic effects resulting from occupational exposure to complex PAH mixtures that contain benzo[ a]
pyrene. The most commonly encountered – and most widely studied – mechanistically relevant DNA lesion is the anti-benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-diol-
9,10-oxide-DNA adduct. The formation of this adduct is consistent with anti-benzo[ a]pyrene-
7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide-associated genotoxic 
effects in surrogate tissues and with the muta -
tion pattern in the TP53  gene in lung tumours 
from humans exposed to PAH mixtures that contain benzo[ a]pyrene. The fact that those 
PAH mixtures and benzo[ a]pyrene itself induce 
genotoxic effects like sister chromatid exchange, chromosomal aberrations, micronuclei, DNA 
damage (comet assay) and 8-oxo-deoxyguano -
sine, supports the notion that benzo[ a]pyrene 
contributes to human cancer.
5. Evaluation
There is sufficient evidence  for the carci -
nogenicity of benzo[ a]pyrene in experimental 
animals.
[No epidemiological data on benzo[ a]pyrene 
alone were available to the Working Group.]
The genotoxic mechanism of action of 
benzo[ a]pyrene involves metabolism to highly 
reactive species that form covalent adducts 
to DNA. These anti-benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-diol-
9,10-oxide-DNA adducts induce mutations in 
the K- RAS  oncogene and the TP53  tumour-
suppressor gene in human lung tumours, and 
137IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
in corresponding genes in mouse-lung tumours. 
Exposure to benzo[ a]pyrene and benzo[ a]pyrene-
containing complex mixtures also induce other genotoxic effects, including sister chromatid exchange, micronuclei, DNA damage and 8-oxo-
deoxyguanosine, all of which can contribute to 
the carcinogenic effects of benzo[ a]pyrene and 
benzo[ a]pyrene-containing complex mixtures 
in exposed humans.
Benzo[ a]pyrene is carcinogenic to humans 
(Group 1) .
In making the overall evaluation, the Working 
Group took the following into consideration:
The strong and extensive experimental 
evidence for the carcinogenicity of benzo[ a]
pyrene in many animal species, supported by the consistent and coherent mechanistic evidence 
from experimental and human studies provide 
biological plausibility to support the overall classification of benzo[ a]pyrene as a human 
carcinogen (Group 1).

1441451. Exposure Data
During coal gasification, coal is reacted with 
oxygen, steam and carbon dioxide to form a gas 
containing hydrogen and carbon monoxide. 
During this process, which is essentially incom -
plete combustion, the heat evolved is consumed 
and the sulfur and nitrogen in the coal are 
converted to hydrogen sulfide (rather than sulfur dioxide) and ammonia (rather than nitrogen 
oxides), respectively. These reduced forms of 
sulfur and nitrogen are easily isolated, captured and used, making gasification a clean-coal tech -
nology with a better environmental performance than coal combustion ( Shadle et al., 2002 ).
Depending on the type of gasifier (e.g. air-
blown, enriched oxygen-blown) and the oper -
ating conditions, gasification can be used to produce a fuel gas that is suitable for several 
applications (e.g. low heating-value fuel gas for 
use as industrial fuel and for power produc -
tion; medium heating-value fuel gas for use as a 
synthesis gas in the production of chemicals such 
as ammonia and methanol, and for transporta -
tion fuel; or high heating-value gas) ( Shadle et al., 
2002 ).
Gasification takes place in fixed-bed, fluid -
ized-bed, moving-bed, and entrained-flow gasi -
fiers. The earliest gasification processes were developed by use of a counter-current, fixed-bed gasifier, in which coal was fed onto the top of the 
bed and travelled downwards against the flow of 
gases. Atmospheric fixed-bed gasifiers of various designs are still occasionally found in small-scale 
industries. On a large scale, several Lurgi fixed-
bed pressurized gasification plants are currently operating commercially, e.g. in the Republic of 
South Africa and in the USA ( Shadle et al., 2002 ; 
Crelling et al ., 2005 ). Fluidized-bed gasification, 
invented in 1922 by Winkler at BASF in Germany, has the advantage of a fairly simple reactor design. 
In this process, the air and steam flow required for gasification is sufficient to fluidize the bed of 
coal, char and ash. Fluidization occurs when the 
gas-flow velocity lifts the particles and causes the gas–solid mixture to flow like a fluid ( Shadle 
et al., 2002 ; Crelling et al., 2005 ). Entrained-flow 
gasification takes place in a flame-like reaction zone, usually at a very high temperature, to 
produce a liquid slag. For economical operations, 
a high-standard heat-recovery system is manda -
tory, but the gas product typically has a very 
low methane content and is free of tars, oils and 
phenols, which thereby considerably simplifies gas and water treatment. Entrained-flow gasi -
fiers of the Koppers-Totzek design are operated at atmospheric pressure. They are used industri -
ally in many countries to produce hydrogen or COAL GASI fICATION
Coal gasification was considered by previous IARC Working Groups in 1983, 1987 , and 2005 
(IARC, 1984 , 1987 , 2010 ). Since that time new data have become available, which have been 
incorporated in this Monograph , and taken into consideration in the present evaluation. IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
synthesis gas ( Shadle et al ., 2002 ; Crelling et al ., 
2005 ).
The moving-bed gasifiers produce tars, 
oils, phenols and heavy hydrocarbons, and the 
concentrations in the gas product are controlled 
by quenching and water scrubbing. Fluidized-bed 
gasifiers produce significantly smaller amounts of these compounds because of higher oper -
ating temperatures. Entrained-flow gasifiers that operate at even higher temperatures (in excess of 1650 °C) can achieve carbon conversions of 
more than 99.5%, while generating essentially 
no organic compounds heavier than methane (Shadle et al., 2002 ).
In addition to PAHs, workers in coal gasi -
fication may be exposed to many compounds, including asbestos, silica, amines, arsenic, 
cadmium, lead, nickel, vanadium, hydrocar -
bons, sulfur dioxide, sulfuric acid and aldehydes 
(IARC, 1984 ).
2. Cancer in Humans
2.1 Cohort studies of coal-gasification 
workers
Occupational exposure during coal gasifica -
tion was evaluated in IARC Monograph  Volume 
92 (IARC, 2010 ). There was sufficient evidence  in 
epidemiological studies for the carcinogenicity 
of occupational exposure during coal gasifica -
tion. The main body of evidence came from two cohort studies of coal-gasification workers in the United Kingdom ( Doll et al., 1972 ) and Germany 
(Berger & Manz, 1992 ), and a case–control study 
nested within a cohort of French gas- and elec -
tricity-production workers ( Martin et al ., 2000 ; 
see Table  2.1, available at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100F/100F-10-Table2.1.pdf ). In all studies an excess of lung 
cancer in association with coal gasification was found, which was not likely to be explained by confounding from tobacco smoking. There was evidence supporting a lung-cancer excess in a 
historical record-linkage study from the United 
Kingdom ( Kennaway & Kennaway, 1947 ), in two 
smaller cohorts ( Kawai et al., 1967 ; Hansen et al., 
1986 ), and a large but inadequately reported 
Chinese study ( Wu, 1988).
In addition to lung cancer, the study from 
the United Kingdom ( Doll et al ., 1972 ) showed 
an excess of bladder cancer, and the German study ( Berger & Manz, 1992 ) showed an excess 
of cancers of the stomach and colon-rectum.
No epidemiological studies of coal-gasifi -
cation workers have been published since the 
previous evaluation ( IARC, 2010 ).
2.2 Synthesis
In three large studies, a consistent excess of 
lung cancer was found in association with occu -
pational exposure during coal gasification. This 
excess was not likely to be explained by tobacco smoking.
3. Cancer in Experimental Animals
Coal-tars from gas works were previously 
evaluated in IARC Monograph  Volume 34 
(IARC, 1984 ). As early as 1923 and in subse -
quent decades, crude coal-tars from gas-works were tested for carcinogenicity by skin applica -
tion in six studies in mice and two studies in rabbits. These tars induced a high number of skin papillomas and carcinomas in all studies in mice 
(Deelman, 1923 ; Kennaway, 1925 ; Hieger, 1929 ; 
Woglom & Herly, 1929 ; Berenblum & Schoental, 
1947 ; Grigorev, 1960 ) and in both studies in 
rabbits (Berenblum & Schoental, 1947 ; Grigorev, 
1960 ). No new studies have been published since 
the previous evaluation.

second study, female A/J mice developed lung 
adenomas at an increased incidence and multi -
plicity ( Weyand et al ., 1995 ). The third study, 
in male and female B6C3F1 mice, did not show 
an increase in tumour incidence ( Weyand et al ., 
1994 ). In male mice, intraperitoneal injection 
of MGP produced a significant increase in liver 
tumours, mostly adenomas ( Rodriguez et al ., 
1997 ). No new studies have been published since 
the previous evaluation.
4. Other Relevant Data
4.1 Mechanistic evidence relevant to 
the carcinogenic hazards from 
occupational exposures during 
coal gasification
4.1.1  Experimental systems
As reported in IARC Monograph  Volume 34 
(IARC, 1984 ), coal-gasification samples from the 
process stream and waste by-products were found 
to be mutagenic in various strains of Salmonella typhimurium  in the presence of an exogenous 
metabolic activation system. The mutagenicity was found primarily in the fractions containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and their alkylated derivatives. The basic and neutral fractions of tar condensed from a product-gas 
stream induced both 6-thioguanine-resistant 
and 8-azaadenine-resistant mutations in DNA repair-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells in 
the presence of exogenous metabolic activation. 
However, neither the micronucleus frequency nor the number of chromosomal aberrations 
were significantly increased by this treatment.
Male B6C3F1 mice were fed a diet containing 
coal tar from a gas plant residue. A complex pattern of aromatic adducts was observed in liver, lung, 
and fore-stomach DNA of these animals, which increased with dose and duration of treatment. 
In lung DNA one adduct was tentatively identi -
fied as anti-benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-oxide-
deoxyguanosine. This adduct was also identified in fore-stomach DNA from female B6C3F1 mice 
fed coal tar-containing diets ( Culp & Beland, 
1994 ). The identity of this adduct was confirmed 
upon analysis of lung DNA of female B6C3F1 mice fed a diet containing coal tar from manu -
factured gas plant residue. However, based on the 
levels of this specific adduct it was suggested that 
benzo[ a]pyrene (B[ a]P) contributes only a small 
fraction to the DNA adducts formed in lung 
tissue of mice that were given coal tar ( Beland 
et al ., 2005 ). Male B6C3F1 mice were fed diets 
containing 0.1–1% (w/w) coal tar for 15 days. Adduct formation in the lung, but not in the fore-
stomach, was dose-related. The B[ a]P content in 
the coal tar could not account by itself for the 
aromatic DNA-adduct levels measured ( Weyand 
et al ., 1991 ). Strain A/J mice formed aromatic 
DNA adducts in the lungs after ingestion of coal tar from manufactured gas plant residue via the 
diet. Three major DNA adducts were identified as being derived from benzo[ b]fluoranthene, 
benzo[ a]pyrene, and benzo[ c]fluorene ( Koganti 
et al., 2000 ; Koganti et al., 2001 ). In another study, 
female ICR mice received topical application of 
manufactured gas plant residue. In the complex 
pattern of lung DNA adducts, one was identi -
fied as being derived from 7H-benzo[ c]fluorene. 
149IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
However, detailed quantitative results after chro -
matographic separation of the residue into seven 
fractions suggested that components other than 
7H-benzo[ c]fluorene played an important role in 
adduct formation in lung DNA ( Cizmas et al ., 
2004 ). A retrospective comparison of tumour 
induction and DNA-adduct formation by B[ a]
P and coal tars in several experimental proto -
cols indicated that tumour outcomes were not predicted by the formation of total DNA adducts or by the DNA adducts formed by B[ a]P. These 
data suggest that B[ a]P content by itself is not 
predictive of tumour outcome ( Goldstein et al ., 
1998 ).
In IARC Monograph  Volumes 32 and 92 
(IARC, 1983 , 2010 ), benzo[ b]fluoranthene 
was evaluated and found to be both genotoxic 
and carcinogenic in experimental studies. 
7H-benzo[ c]fluorene was carcinogenic to mice 
(IARC, 2010 ), but gave inconclusive results as a 
bacterial mutagen in Salmonella typhimurium  
strains TA98 and TA100 in the presence of an Aroclor-1254-induced rat-liver S9 ( IARC, 1983 ). 
While a 7H-benzo[ c]fluorene-DNA adduct was 
observed in mice that received topical applica -
tions of manufactured gas plant residue ( Cizmas 
et al ., 2004 ), the structure of this adduct is 
unknown, although a diol epoxide structure has been proposed ( Wang et al., 2002 ).
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the 
ambient air in gas works have been analysed (IARC, 1984 ) and several of these have been 
shown to be mutagenic (i.e. benz[ a]anthracene, 
benzo[ a]pyrene, benzo[ ghi]perylene) and carci -
nogenic (i.e. benz[ a]anthracene, benzo[ a]pyrene) 
in experimental studies ( IARC, 1983 , 2010 ; Platt 
& Grupe, 2005 ; Platt et al., 2008a , b). These poly -
cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons may contribute to 
the genotoxic and tumorigenic activities of tars 
from coal gasification.
Naphthalene has been reported to be a 
constituent of tar from coal gasification ( IARC, 
1984 ). Naphthalene is genotoxic and induces tumours in experimental animals ( IARC, 1982 ; 
Brusick et al., 2008 ).
4.1.2  Humans
There are no studies that describe specific 
effects in workers exposed to emissions associ -
ated with coal gasification.
4.2 Synthesis
There is strong evidence from experimental 
studies for a genotoxic mode of action for coal-
gasification samples. Although there are no 
human studies, it is highly likely that geno-toxicity is the mechanism relevant to the carci -
nogenic hazards from exposures to emissions of coal gasification.
5. Evaluation
There is sufficient evidence  in humans for the 
carcinogenicity of coal gasification. Coal gasifi -
cation causes cancer of the lung.
There is sufficient  evidence  in experimental 
animals for the carcinogenicity of coal-tars from 
gas-works and manufactured gas plant residues.
There is strong evidence for a genotoxic 
mechanism for coal gasification samples based on experimental studies. Although there are no 
human studies, it is highly likely that genotoxicity is the mechanism for the carcinogenic effects of 
coal-gasification emissions, predominantly due 
to the presence of mutagenic PAHs.
Coal gasification is carcinogenic to humans

1.1 Manufacturing process
Coal tar is obtained by cooling the gas that 
is formed during the destructive distillation of 
coal to approximately ambient temperature. 
It is a black, viscous liquid composed prima -
rily of a complex mixture of condensed-ring 
aromatic hydrocarbons. It may contain phenolic 
compounds, aromatic nitrogen bases and their alkyl derivatives, and paraffinic and olefinic 
hydrocarbons. Coal-tar pitch is the residue from 
the distillation of coal tar ( Betts, 1997 ).
The largest source of tar and pitch is the 
pyrolysis or carbonization of coal. Until the end of the Second World War, coal tar was the main source of benzene, toluene, xylenes, phenol, 
cresols and cresylic acids, pyridine and methyl -
pyridines, naphthalene, anthracene, creosote, tar 
paints, road tars and pitch binders ( Betts, 1997 ). 
However, by the 1990s, over 90% of the world production of these aromatic chemicals was derived from the petrochemical industry, and 
coal tar became chiefly a source of anti-corrosion 
coatings, wood preservatives, feed-stocks for the manufacture of carbon black and binders for electrodes ( Betts, 1997 ).
Coal-tar distillation products comprise essen -
tially the distillate (primarily a complex mixture of mono- and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) 
and the residue from the distillation (pitch) 
(Betts, 1997 ).
The part of coke-oven tar that is normally 
distillable at atmospheric pressure boils at up to ~400 °C and contains principally aromatic hydrocarbons. These include (in order of the 
distillation fraction): benzene, toluene and the 
xylene isomers, tri- and tetra-methylbenzenes, indene, hydrindene (indane), and coumarone; 
polar compounds, including tar acids (phenol 
and cresols) and tar bases (pyridine, picolines (methylpyridines) and lutidines (dimethylpyrid -
ines)); naphthalene, contaminated with small but significant amounts of thionaphthene, indene and other compounds; methylnaphthalene 
isomers; biphenyl, acenaphthene and fluorene; 
anthracene and phenanthrene; pyrene and fluoranthene ( Betts, 1997 ).
Much less is known about the composi -
tion of pitch, the residue from coal-tar distilla -
tion. Studies of coke-oven pitch indicate that it 
contains: four-membered aromatic hydrocarbon OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURES DURING  
COAL-TAR DISTILLATION
Occupational exposures during coal-tar distillation were considered by a previous Working 
Group in 2005 ( IARC, 2010 ). Since that time new data have become available, which have 
been incorporated in this Monograph,  and taken into consideration in the present evaluation.IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F

heterocyclic compounds ( Betts, 1997 ).
For a more detailed description of the coal-
tar distillation process, see the previous IARC Monograph  (IARC, 2010 ).
1.2 Occupational exposure
Concentrations of PAHs in the ambient air 
and in urine of workers in coal-tar distillation 
have been measured in several studies. The 
results are summarized in Table 1.1 . The levels of 
PAH exposures overall were similar in installa -
tions that used the high-temperature process and much lower in the low-temperature distillation facility. A study from Germany ( Preuss et al ., 
2003 ) showed high air concentrations of total 
PAHs as well as urinary 1-hydroxypyrene levels.
2. Cancer in Humans
A previous Working Group ( IARC, 2010 ) 
concluded that there was sufficient evidence  in 
humans for the carcinogenicity of occupational exposures during coal-tar distillation. Two large surveillance programmes provided evidence of 
an increased risk for skin cancer among coal-tar 
distillers. Notifications of skin cancer in England during 1911–38 were analysed in relation to 
occupation and more than 700 skin cancers 
attributed to exposure to coal tar among coal-tar distillers had been recorded; crude mortality 
rates of scrotal cancer were very high among coal-tar distillers ( Henry, 1946 ). Occupational 
health surveillance in a German coal-tar distil -
lation plant identified 606 individuals with skin 
lesions during 1946–96, a third of whom had also malignant skin tumours (squamous-cell 
and basal-cell carcinoma); 20 cases of scrotal 
cancer (squamous-cell) were observed ( Letzel 
& Drexler, 1998 ). No indication of an increased 
risk for skin cancer was found in more recent cohort-mortality studies, but mortality studies are not sufficiently sensitive to identify poten -
tial risks for skin cancer. The findings for other cancer sites were inconsistent. A modest, non-significant increase in mortality was reported for 
lung cancer in one British and one Dutch study 
(Maclaren & Hurley, 1987 ; Swaen & Slangen, 
1997 ), and a significant excess in the incidence 
of buccal cavity and pharyngeal cancers was reported in a French study ( Moulin et al., 1988 ).
Since the previous evaluation ( IARC, 2010 ) 
there have been no further relevant studies of cancer risk associated with occupational expo -
sures during coal-tar distillation.
3. Cancer in Experimental Animals
Three high-temperature tars – one undiluted 
and two as benzene extracts – produced skin 
tumours, including carcinomas, when applied to 
the skin of mice. Each one of five blast-furnace tars and two extracts of blast-furnace tars 
produced skin tumours, including carcinomas, 
after topical application to mice ( IARC, 1985 ). 
Likewise, each one of five pharmaceutical coal-
tar preparations caused skin tumours, including 
carcinomas, when applied to the skin of mice (IARC, 1985 ).
Two unspecified coal tars caused skin 
tumours, including carcinomas, after applica -
tion to the skin of mice. Lung tumours but not 
skin tumours were produced in rats after appli -
cation of coal tar to the skin. In one study, an 
155IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
unspecified coal tar produced tumours when 
applied to the ears of rabbits ( IARC, 1985 ).
No data were available to the Working Group 
on the carcinogenicity of distillation fractions of low-temperature tars or of products derived from 
these tars ( IARC, 1985 ).
In addition, several individual polynuclear 
aromatic compounds for which there is sufficient 
evidence  of carcinogenicity in experimental 
animals have been measured at high concentra -
tions in air samples taken from certain areas in coal-tar distillation plants ( IARC, 2010 ).
4. Other Relevant Data
4.1 Mechanistic considerations 
relevant to the carcinogenic 
hazards of exposures during  
coal-tar distillation
4.1.1  Experimental systems
In previous IARC Monographs  (IARC, 1985 , 
1987 , 2010 ) coal-tar pitch and roofing-tar emis -
sions were found to be mutagenic in Salmonella 
typhimurium  (in the presence of an exogenous 
metabolic activation system) and in two mamma -
lian cell systems (in the presence and absence of an exogenous metabolic activation system). Coal-tar pitch and roofing-tar emissions induced 
sister chromatid exchange in Chinese hamster 
ovary cells and enhanced viral transformation in Syrian hamster embryo cells (both in the absence 
and presence of an exogenous metabolic activa -
tion system). Samples of therapeutic coal-tars, 
extracts of coal-tar shampoos, an industrial coal-
tar-pitch and vapours escaping from a coal-tar 
sample at 37 °C were all mutagenic in Salmonella 
typhimurium  in the presence of an exogenous 
metabolic activation system.
Coal tar applied topically to the skin of male 
Parkes mice produced a complex pattern of DNA adducts in skin and lung tissues when analysed by means of 
32P-postlabelling ( Schoket et al ., 
1988 ), with one adduct spot tentatively identified 
as benzo[ ghi]perylene ( Hughes et al., 1993 ).
Benzo[ ghi]perylene was shown to be photo-
mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium  strains. 
It induced DNA strand-breaks (comet assay) in V79 Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts with photo-activation ( Yan et al., 2004 ; Platt & Grupe, 
2005 ; Platt et al ., 2008a ; IARC, 2010 ). The major 
metabolic intermediate of benzo[ ghi]perylene 
is the K-region oxide, 3,4-epoxy-3,4-dihydro-
benzo[ ghi]perylene ( Platt et al., 2008b ).
Male B6C3F1 mice fed a diet containing 
coal tar from manufactured gas plant residue produced a complex pattern of aromatic adducts 
in DNA of the liver, lung, and fore-stomach, which increased with dose and time of treatment; one 
of the adducts was identified as the anti-benzo[ a]
pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-oxide-deoxyguanosine-
adduct ( Culp & Beland, 1994; Culp et al ., 2000 ). 
In a similarly designed feeding study, a complex pattern of aromatic DNA adducts was produced in the lung, fore-stomach, and spleen tissues 
of mice; it was demonstrated that the benzo[ a]
pyrene content alone in the coal tar could not 
account for the aromatic DNA-adduct levels 
(Weyand et al ., 1991 ). In the lung of female A/J 
mice fed a diet containing coal tar from manu -
factured gas plant residue, three major aromatic DNA adducts were identified as being derived 
from benzo[ b]fluoranthene, benzo[ a]pyrene, 
and 7H-benzo[ c]fluorene ( Weyand & Wu, 1995 ; 
Koganti et al ., 2000 ). The 7H -benzo[ c]fluorene-
DNA adduct was also observed in mice who received topical application of manufactured gas 
plant residue ( Cizmas et al., 2004 ); the structure of 
this adduct is unknown, although a diol epoxide 
structure has been proposed ( Wang et al., 2002 ).
In the previous IARC Monograph  (IARC, 
2010 ) benzo[ b]fluoranthene was found to be both 
genotoxic and carcinogenic in experimental 
studies. 7H-benzo[ c]fluorene gave inconclusive 
results when tested for mutagenicity in Salmonella 
156Coal-tar distillation
typhimurium  strains TA98 and TA100 in the 
presence of rat liver S9 ( IARC, 1983 ), but it was 
found to be carcinogenic to mice ( IARC, 2010 ).
Coal tar applied topically to lambda-
lacZ  transgenic mice (MutaMouse®) strongly 
increased the mutation frequency in epidermal 
cells. Isolated epidermal cells from C3H/Tif/hr hairless mice that had been given coal tar had 
higher levels of DNA strand-breaks (as analysed 
in the comet assay) (Thein et al., 2000 ). In female 
B6C3F1 mice fed diets containing coal tar, cell 
proliferation was increased in the small intestine. 
K-ras , H-ras , and p53  mutations were observed 
in the coal tar-induced tumours, the most abun -
dant being K-ras  mutations in fore-stomach and 
lung tumours ( Culp et al., 2000 ).
Chemical analyses of high-temperature coal 
tars have identified a series of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that are both genotoxic and carci -
nogenic in experimental studies. Among these 
compounds are benz[ a]anthracene, benzo[ b]
fluoranthene, benzo[ k]fluoranthene, benzo[ a]
pyrene, dibenz[ a,h]anthracene, chrysene, and 
indeno[1,2,3- cd]pyrene ( IARC, 1983 , 1985 , 2010 ). 
These polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons may 
contribute in part to the genotoxic and tumori -
genic activities of coal tars.
Both naphthalene and benzene are constitu -
ents of coal tars produced by various processes 
(IARC, 1985 ). Both chemicals are genotoxic and 
induce tumours in experimental animals ( IARC, 
1982 , 2002 ). Benzene is considered to be carcino -
genic to humans ( IARC, 2002 ).
4.1.2  Humans
In previous Monographs  (IARC, 1985 , 2010 ) 
short-term assays were reviewed to assess the genotoxic effects of coal-tar exposure in humans. 
Patients treated with coal-tar ointments produced urine that was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimu -
rium  strains TA98 and YG1024 in the presence 
of an Aroclor–1254-induced rat-liver metabolic activation system. In the S. typhimurium  strain YG1024, GSTM1 -null patients had higher levels 
of mutagens in their urine than GSTM1 -positive 
patients.
DNA-adduct measurements that involved 
coal-tar workers or patients undergoing coal-
tar therapy have focused solely on detection 
of benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-oxide-DNA 
adducts. In the skin and white blood cells (mono -
cytes, lymphocytes, and granulocytes) of a group of eczema patients topically treated with coal-tar ointments the presence of aromatic DNA adducts 
was demonstrated by means of 
32P-postlabelling 
analysis. One of the adducts co-migrated with the benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-oxide-DNA 
adduct ( Godschalk et al ., 1998 ). Analysis of the 
same adduct by use of an HPLC/ fluorescence method in a group of 26 psoriasis patients showed 
that the percentage of subjects with adducts did not exceed the 95 percentile control-subject 
value ( Pavanello et al ., 1999 ). The white blood 
cells of 23 psoriasis patients undergoing clinical 
coal-tar therapy were examined for the presence 
of benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-oxide-DNA 
adducts with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA). These adducts were detected and 
the adduct levels decreased with time after treat -
ment, but no relationship could be ascertained 
between the level of exposure and the number 
of adducts and no difference in DNA-adduct 
formation was found between smoking and non-smoking patients ( Paleologo et al ., 1992 ). 
PAH diolepoxide-DNA adducts and GSTM1  
genotype were determined in white blood cells of 57 psoriasis patients and 53 controls by use 
of ELISA and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 
respectively. These DNA adducts were slightly elevated in patients compared with controls. 
There was no relationship between the presence 
of the GSTM1  gene and the number of adducts 
(Santella et al ., 1995 ). Skin-biopsy samples from 
12 psoriasis patients receiving coal-tar ointments contained aromatic DNA adducts, measured by 
32P-postlabelling analysis ( Schoket et al ., 1990 ). 
In another 32P-postlabelling study no significant 
157IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
effects were reported of a similar treatment of 
psoriasis patients on the levels of benzo[ a]pyrene-
7,8-diol-9,10-oxide-DNA adducts in peripheral blood lymphocytes ( Pavanello & Levis, 1994 ). 
In a study of 111 Korean painters using coal-tar-
based paint, the levels of aromatic DNA adducts 
measured by 
32P-postlabelling analysis were 
slightly higher compared with 17 on-site control 
workers (Lee et al., 2003 ).
In lymphocytes of 49 coal-tar workers a 
significant increase of chromosomal aberrations, sister chromatid exchange, and satellite asso -
ciations was observed, compared with values in 
non-exposed controls ( Yadav & Seth, 1998 ).
Increased levels of p53 peotein were found in 
skin biopsies of atopic eczema patients treated topically with coal-tar; a correlation was observed 
between p53 and aromatic DNA-adduct levels 
measured in the same tissue by 
32P-postlabelling 
analysis ( Godschalk et al., 2001 ).
4.2 Synthesis
In experimental systems, coal tars were 
mutagenic in bacteria and mammalian cells, and 
induced sister chromatid exchange and morpho -
logical cell transformation in cultured mamma -
lian cells. Coal tar was also mutagenic in vivo , in 
transgenic mice. Mouse-lung tumours induced 
by coal-tar treatment had mutations in the K- ras 
proto-oncogene.
Epidemiological studies in humans and 
studies in experimental animals were consistent with respect to coal-tar exposures being carcino -
genic to the lung. Coal tars produced lung and skin tumours in mice and rats after exposure by inhalation, lung tumours in rats after dermal 
treatment, and skin tumours in mice after dermal 
treatment. Coal tar was a mouse skin-tumour 
initiator (see Section 3).
Indications on the role of PAH in the mecha -
nism of action of exposure to coal tar are based on the detection of DNA adducts of several PAHs, 
e.g. benzo[ ghi]perylene, benzo[ b]fluoranthene, 7H-benzo[ c]fluorene and benzo[ a]pyrene in in 
vitro  studies, with DNA adducts of benzo[ b]
fluoranthene, benzo[ c]fluorene and benzo[ a]
pyrene being detected in lung tissues of exposed 
animals. The benzo[ a]pyrene DNA adduct was 
identified as an anti-benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-diol-
9,10-oxide-deoxyguanosine-adduct. 
In studies in humans, the urine from patients 
undergoing coal-tar treatments was mutagenic 
in bacteria. Peripheral blood lymphocytes of 
workers occupationally exposed to coal tars had 
increased chromosomal damage. Measurements of PAH-DNA adducts in human studies are 
based exclusively on detection of benzo[ a]
pyrene-DNA adducts, in particular anti- benzo[ a]
pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-oxide-deoxyguanosine.
In conclusion, studies in experimental 
systems and in surrogate tissues of humans 
provide strong evidence for a genotoxic/muta -
genic mechanism underlying the effects of occu -
pational exposures during coal-tar distillation.
5. Evaluation
There is sufficient evidence  in humans for 
the carcinogenicity of occupational exposures 
during coal-tar distillation. Occupational expo -
sures during coal-tar distillation cause cancer of 
the skin (including, but not limited to, cancer of 
the scrotum).
There is sufficient evidence  in experimental 
animals for the carcinogenicity of coal tars.
Studies in experimental systems and in 
tissues of humans provide strong evidence for a 
genotoxic mechanism underlying the effects of 
occupational exposures during coal-tar distilla -
tion in humans. The detection of anti-benzo[ a]
pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide-DNA adducts in 
the peripheral blood lymphocytes of exposed 
humans suggests the participation of benzo[ a]
pyrene in the genotoxic mechanism of this expo -
sure in humans.
Occupational exposures during coal-tar 
distillation are carcinogenic to humans (Group 1) .

1601611. Exposure Data
1.1 Identification of the agent
Studies of coke-oven pitch indicate that coal-
tar pitch contains: four-membered aromatic 
hydrocarbon ring systems (e.g. chrysene, fluoran -
thene, pyrene, triphenylene, naphthacene and 
benzanthracene); five-membered ring systems 
(picene, benzo[ a]pyrene (B[ a]P) and benzo[ e]
pyrene, benzofluoranthenes and perylene); 
six-membered ring systems (dibenzopyrenes, 
dibenzofluoranthenes and benzoperylenes); and 
seven-ring systems (coronene). Other aromatic chemicals in coal-tar pitch include methylated 
and polymethylated derivatives, mono- and 
polyhydroxylated derivatives, and heterocyclic compounds ( Betts, 1997 ).
For a more detailed description of the coal-
tar distillation process, including coal-tar pitch, the reader is referred to IARC Monograph  
Volume 92 ( IARC, 2010 ), and to the Monograph  
on Occupational Exposures during Coal-tar Distillation in this volume. 1.2 Human exposure
1.2.1  Occupational exposure
Coal-tar pitch is used in electrode manufac -
ture, roofing and paving. 
Studies examining exposures during roofing 
and paving published since the previous IARC 
Monograph  (IARC, 2010 ) are summarized below.
(a) Roofing
The exposures associated with roofing are 
the result of two operations. First, the old roof 
is removed by cutting, prying and scraping the 
existing material from the roof, and discarding it. A new roof is then installed by melting solid 
blocks of coal-tar pitch, pumping or carrying 
buckets of the molten material to the roof, where layers of roofing felt and liquid coal-tar pitch 
are spread upon the surface to produce a cover 
(NIOSH, 2000 ; IPCS, 2004 ). Roofers are prima -
rily exposed to PAHs. Other exposures include 
silica, diesel exhaust, asbestos and organic 
solvents. Recent studies on airborne concentra -
tions of PAHs measured in roofing are summa -
rized in Table 1.1 . 
Studies in the USA showed that long after 
cessation of applying coal-tar pitch on roofs, COAL-TAR PITCH
Coal-tar pitch and associated exposures were considered by previous IARC Working Groups 
in 1984, 1987 , and 2005 ( IARC, 1985 , 1987 , 2010 ). Since that time new data have become 
available, which have been incorporated in this Monograph,  and taken into consideration 
in the present evaluation.IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F

workers can still be exposed to coal tar during 
tear-off of existing roofs ( Toraason et al ., 2001 ; 
McClean et al ., 2007 ). Working with coal-tar 
pitch was associated with a sixfold increase in PAH exposure, an eightfold increase in pyrene 
exposure and a 35-fold increase in benzo[ a]
pyrene exposure. Urinary 1-OH-pyrene concen -
trations in workers and controls showed a fivefold difference at post-shift and a 7.2-fold difference 
several hours later, which shows the importance of dermal exposure resulting in a prolonged 
uptake after the end-of-shift.
(b) Paving
Roadway paving can be conducted by several 
methods, including hot-mix laying and chip 
sealing. In hot-mix laying, the mixture of a binder (coal tar, bitumen or a blended product 
containing both) and aggregate (stone chips) 
is spread on the roadway by a paving machine, followed by a roller. In the chip-sealing process 
(also known as surface dressing), the liquid 
binder (coal tar, bitumen, or a mixture of the two) is sprayed directly onto the road surface, 
then the aggregate stone is spread on top and 
rolled ( Darby et al., 1986 ).
Detailed information on cessation of coal-
tar use in the European paving industry has been collected in the course of an IARC study on cancer mortality among asphalt workers. 
Table  1.2  presents the last reported year-of-use 
of coal tar in paving by any company that partici -
pated in the cohort study. The data originated from a company questionnaire and its ensuing 
evaluation by country-specific experts ( Burstyn 
et al ., 2003 ). A gradient in cessation of use can 
be seen, with Scandinavian countries ending use earlier than central and southern European countries, such as the Netherlands, France and 
Germany. However, even within countries, large 
differences in the use of coal tar have occurred between companies, depending on the supplier 
of the asphalt mixes and the presence of coke 
ovens in the neighbourhood. Even after cessation of the use of coal tar, workers in road paving have continued to be exposed to this substance due 
to the use of recycled coal-tar asphalt in some 
countries.
2. Cancer in Humans
In IARC Monograph  Volume 92 ( IARC, 2010 ) 
it was concluded that there is sufficient evidence  in 
humans for the carcinogenicity of occupational exposures during paving and roofing with coal-tar pitch. This was based on studies of pavers and 
roofers who presumably had been exposed to 
coal-tar pitch (and often also to bitumen), which suggested increased cancer risks in these occupa -
tions. An excess risk for lung cancer was reported in studies of members of a roofer’s union in the USA, in analyses of registry-based data on pavers 
in the United Kingdom and roofers in the USA, 
and in follow-up studies of cancer incidence among pavers in Finland and the Netherlands 
(Kennaway & Kennaway, 1947 , 1951 ; Hammond 
et al., 1976 ; Milham, 1982 ; Pukkala, 1995 ; Swaen 
& Slangen, 1997 ; Stern et al., 2000 ). An increased 
mortality from urinary bladder, laryngeal or skin 
(non-melanoma) cancer was observed in one or 
more of these cohorts, but this finding was not 
widely supported by other studies. In three case–control studies conducted in the USA, a tobacco-
smoking-adjusted increase in the risk for lung

cancer was reported among roofers ( Schoenberg 
et al., 1987 ; Zahm et al., 1989 ; Morabia et al., 1992 ) 
however, none of these increases was statistically 
significant. A meta-analysis of the case–control studies reported a statistically significant meta-
relative risk ( Partanen & Boffetta, 1994 ).
Since the previous evaluation ( IARC, 2010 ) a 
few additional studies have been published with information on paving with coal-tar pitch and 
associated cancers. 
2.1 Cohort Studies
Roofing and flooring, and paving of roads 
involve the use of bitumen and coal-tar pitch. 
Although coal-tar pitch has been phased out in 
most countries, some studies published since the previous IARC Monograph  (IARC, 2010 ) have 
included workers in road-paving exposed to both petroleum-based bitumen and coal-tar pitch.
In studies in France, Norway, and Sweden 
a higher lung cancer mortality or incidence was found among workers first employed while the asphalt mixes still contained some coal tar 
(before 1970 in France and before 1965 in Norway 
and Sweden). None of the elevated rates were statistically significant ( Bergdahl & Järvholm, 
2003 ; Randem et al ., 2003 ; Stücker et al ., 
2003 ). In the French study a higher but statisti -
cally non-significant mortality from stomach 
cancer was found in workers hired before 1970 
(Stücker et al ., 2003 ; see Table  2.1, available at 
http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/
vol100F/100F-12-Table2.1.pdf ).
In a study in Finland raod-paving workers 
were ranked by coal-tar exposure (see Table 2.1 on-line). Relative to those not exposed to coal 
tar, the risk for lung cancer was 1.49 for workers exposed to very low level of coal tar (assessed 
semiquantitatively on the basis of score–years) 
and 10.7 for those who exposed to intermediate levels of coal tar (p for trend = 0.05) ( Kauppinen 
et al., 2003 ).Bladder-cancer incidence by estimated 
average and cumulative benzo[ a]pyrene expo -
sure levels was evaluated in paving cohorts from Denmark, Finland, Israel, and Norway (see Table 2.1 on-line). An internal comparison 
showed indications of a trend with average expo -
sure to benzo[ a]pyrene ( P for trend not signifi -
cant) ( Burstyn et al., 2007 ). The overall incidence 
of bladder cancer in European asphalt workers 
was similar to that expected (SMR 1.05; Boffetta et al., 2003 ).
3. Cancer in Experimental Animals
Six coal-tar pitches and three extracts of coal-
tar pitches all produced skin tumours, including 
carcinomas, when applied to the skin of mice. An 
extract of roofing-tar pitch had both initiating and promoting activity in separate experiments 
(IARC, 1985 ).
4. Other Relevant Data
4.1 Mechanistic considerations 
relevant to the cancer hazards 
from exposure during roofing 
and paving with coal-tar pitch
4.1.1  Experimental systems
In previous IARC Monographs  (IARC, 1985 , 
1987 ) short-term tests to assess the genotoxicity 
of coal-tar pitch were reviewed. Coal-tar pitch 
and roofing-tar emissions were mutagenic in bacteria in the presence of an exogenous meta -
bolic activation system, and in mammalian cells with and without metabolic activation. These agents also induced sister chromatid exchange in 
Chinese hamster ovary cells and enhanced viral 
transformation in Syrian hamster embryo cells, 
164Coal-tar pitch
both in the absence and presence of an exogenous 
metabolic activation system.
Chemical analyses of high-temperature coal-
tar pitches identified several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that are genotoxic and carcino -
genic in experimental studies ( IARC, 1985 ). 
These include benz[ a]anthracene, benzo[ b]
fluoranthene, benzo[ k]fluoranthene, benzo[ a]
pyrene, dibenz[ a,h]anthracene, chrysene, and 
indeno[1,2,3- cd]pyrene ( IARC, 1983 , 2010 ). 
These polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons may 
contribute to the genotoxic and tumorigenic 
activities of coal-tar pitches.
4.1.2  Humans
DNA strand-breaks (measured by single-cell 
gel electrophoresis; comet assay) and the 8-oxo-
deoxyguanosine/deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG/
dG) ratio (measured by means of HPLC with electrochemical detection) were determined in 
peripheral blood leukocytes of roofers exposed 
to dust from coal-tar pitch (coal tar) during removal of existing roofs before applying hot 
asphalt. When the workers were stratified by 
1-hydroxypyrene excretion in the urine, the amount of DNA strand-breaks in their leukocytes 
increased, and the 8-oxo-dG/dG ratio decreased 
in a dose-dependent manner ( Toraason et al ., 
2001 ).
4.2 Synthesis
There is strong evidence from experimental 
data that coal-tar pitch has a genotoxic mecha -
nism of action. There is moderate evidence in humans for a genotoxic mechanism underlying the effects of exposures during roofing and 
paving with coal-tar pitch, based on one study.5. Evaluation
There is sufficient evidence  in humans for the 
carcinogenicity of coal-tar pitch as encountered in paving and roofing. Coal-tar pitch as encoun -
tered in paving and roofing causes cancer of the 
lung.
Also, a positive association has been observed 
between exposure to coal-tar pitch as encoun -
tered in paving and roofing, and cancer of the 
bladder.
There is sufficient evidence  in experimental 
animals for the carcinogenicity of coal-tar pitch.
There is strong evidence from experimental 
data that coal-tar pitch has a genotoxic mecha -
nism of action. There is moderate evidence in humans for a genotoxic mechanism underlying 
the effects of exposures during roofing and paving with coal-tar pitch, based on one study.

1.1 Production process
Coke was first produced commercially in 
England in the early eighteenth century. By 
the early to mid-1800s, coke was being widely 
produced in Europe and the United States of America as the major fuel for blast furnaces.
Coal carbonization is a process that yields 
metallurgical coke for use in iron-making blast furnaces and other metal-smelting proc -
esses. Carbonization entails heating the coal to temperatures as high as 1300 °C in the absence of oxygen to distill out tars and light oils. A gaseous 
by-product, referred to as coke-oven gas, together 
with ammonia, water and sulfur compounds are also removed thermally from the coal. The coke 
that remains after this distillation largely consists 
of carbon in various crystallographic forms, but also contains the thermally modified remains of 
various minerals that were in the original coal. 
These mineral residues, commonly referred to as coke ash are not combustible and are left after 
the coke is burned. Coke also contains part of the 
sulfur from the coal. Coke is principally used as a fuel, as a reducing agent and support for other raw 
materials in iron-making blast furnaces. A much smaller amount of coke is used similarly in cupola 
furnaces in the foundry industry. The carboni -
zation by-products are usually refined within the coke plant to commodity chemicals such as elemental sulfur, ammonium sulfate, benzene, 
toluene, xylene and naphthalene. Subsequent 
processing of these chemicals produces a large number of other chemicals and materials. Coke-
oven gas is a valuable heating fuel that is used 
mainly within steel plants, for example, to fire blast-furnace stoves, to soak furnaces for semi-
finished steel, to anneal furnaces and lime kilns 
as well as to heat the coke ovens themselves (Kaegi et al., 1993 ).
Coke is mostly produced from slot-type 
by-product coke ovens. Above the ovens is a roof system from which coal is discharged into each 
oven. Modern technology includes telescopic 
charging chutes to minimize dust emissions during charging. Many facilities also include 
automatic removal and replacement of the 
charging-hole lid. Volatile gases generated from the coal during carbonization flow to the top of 
the oven, into the free space and out through 
standpipes connected to large collecting mains that transport the gases to the by-product plant 
in which they are processed into various mate -
rials. Water is sprayed into the mains to cool the COKE PRODUCTION
Coke production and associated exposures were considered by previous IARC Working 
Groups in 1983, 1987 , and 2005 ( IARC, 1984 , 1987 , 2010 ). Since that time new data have 
become available, which have been incorporated in this Monograph,  and taken into consid -
eration in the present evaluation.IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F

gases and to condense out some of the tar. At 
the end of the coking cycle – which ranges from 
about 15 to 30 hours –, the coke is pushed into 
a hot car (quench car). The hot car may or may not have a moveable roof or partial roof to mini -
mize gaseous and particulate emissions. The hot coke is then quenched before being dropped onto a conveyor system for transportation to 
a blast furnace, storage pile or out of the plant 
(Kaegi et al ., 1993 ; Crelling et al ., 2005 ). For a 
more detailed description of the coke production 
process and coke ovens, the reader is referred to 
the previous IARC Monograph  (IARC (2010) .
In 1990, total worldwide coke production was 
about 378 million tonnes, a production volume that had remained essentially unchanged since 1970. The former USSR was the largest coke 
producer (80 million tonnes), followed by the 
People’s Republic of China (73 million tonnes), Japan (53 million tonnes) and the United States of 
America (USA) (27 million tonnes). Since 1970, 
production in the former USSR has remained in the 75–85 million tonne range, but massive shifts 
in production have occurred in the USA, Japan 
and China. Between 1970 and 1990, production in the USA decreased by more than 50% while 
Japanese production increased by 50%. During 
the same period, China increased coke produc -
tion more than threefold ( Kaegi et al ., 1993 ). By 
1999, worldwide coke production had declined to about 326 million tonnes, of which 121 million tonnes were produced in China ( Terjung, 2000 ).
1.2 Human exposure
Coke-oven workers are primarily exposed 
to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). 
Concentrations of PAHs in the ambient air and 
in urine of workers in coke ovens are summa -
rized in Table 1.1 . In addition to PAHs, coke-
oven workers may be exposed to a large number of compounds, including asbestos, silica, amines, arsenic, cadmium, lead, nickel, vanadium, hydrocarbons, sulfur dioxide, sulfuric acid and aldehydes ( IARC, 1984 ).
More than 30 studies on occupational expo -
sure of coke-oven workers have been reported since 1983, of which six included profiles of 
three PAHs or more; seven others reported levels 
of pyrene, benzo[ a]pyrene or both; the other 
studies reported composite measures (benzene-
soluble fraction, cyclohexane-soluble material) 
or provided data on biological measurements only. A variety of sites across the coke plants 
were sampled, and the overall pattern (regard -
less of the exposure measured) was that topside 
workers (including lidmen, tar chasers and 
Larry-car operators) had the highest exposures, 
followed by workers by the side of the ovens (such as coke-side machine operators, bench-men, 
door repairers, wharf-men, quenchers, pushers 
and temperature controllers). Workers in other areas of the plant such as maintenance, office and 
control workers had the lowest exposures ( Table 
1.1). Modernization of coke plants, including 
improved control measures, can substantially reduce exposures ( Quinlan et al., 1995c ).
2. Cancer in Humans
Occupational exposures during coke produc -
tion were evaluated most recently in IARC Monograph  Volume 92 ( IARC, 2010 ). There was 
sufficient evidence  in epidemiological studies for 
the carcinogenicity of occupational exposures during coke production, although the evidence 
was not uniform. A marked excess of lung cancer and a clear trend of increasing risk for this cancer 
with increasing duration of exposure was found 
in a large cohort study from the USA and Canada (Costantino et al ., 1995 ; see Table  2.1 available 
at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/
vol100F/100F-13-Table2.1.pdf ). In an even larger 
study from China there was also a marked lung-
cancer excess ( Wu, 1988). In cohort studies 
169IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
from France ( Chau et al ., 1993 ), Italy ( Franco 
et al ., 1993 ), Japan ( Sakabe et al ., 1975 ), and 
the Netherlands ( Swaen et al ., 1991 ) increased 
risks for lung cancer were found consistently, 
although not all results were statistically signifi -
cant. No excess of lung cancer was observed in three cohort studies of coke-plant workers in the United Kingdom ( Buck & Reid, 1956 ; Davies, 
1977 ; Hurley et al ., 1983 ), but an excess had 
been found in an earlier record-linkage study in the United Kingdom ( Kennaway & Kennaway, 
1947 ). A smoking-adjusted excess risk for lung 
cancer and a positive association with duration of exposure to coke-oven emissions was found in a 
population-based case–control study of Chinese 
women ( Wu-Williams et al ., 1993 ; see Table 2.2 
available at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/
Monographs/vol100F/100F-13-Table2.2.pdf ). No 
further epidemiological studies of coke-oven 
workers have been published since the previous 
IARC Monograph  (IARC, 2010 ). 
Overall, an increased risk for lung cancer 
was found in three large studies, two of which 
showed evidence of a dose–response; one study was adjusted for smoking. A lung-cancer excess 
is supported by several but not all other avail -
able studies. Thus, there is evidence from epide -
miological studies that lung cancer is causally associated with occupational exposures during 
coke production. The evidence is inadequate to allow and evaluation for cancer of the bladder 
and skin.
3. Cancer in Experimental Animals
Samples of tar from coke ovens were previ -
ously evaluated in IARC Monograph  Volume 
34 ( IARC, 1984 ). No new studies have been 
published since then.3.1 Skin application
Two samples were collected from a modern 
coke oven: a topside air-particulate sample and a coke-oven main sample. The coke-oven topside 
sample was found to contain 478 mg/kg benzo[ a]
pyrene ( Nesnow et al., 1982 , 1983 ).
The coke-oven main sample was applied topi -
cally to groups of 40 male and 40 female SENCAR mice at doses of 0 (control), 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 or 
4.0 mg (in acetone) per mouse on a weekly basis, 
except for the highest dose, which was applied twice weekly at 2.0 mg per application, for 50–52 
weeks. The incidence of skin carcinomas ranged 
from 5–98% in groups of treated mice. No carci -
nomas were observed in the control groups 
(Nesnow et al., 1983 ).
The tumour-promoting activity of the coke-
oven main sample was tested by repeated weekly dermal applications of 0 (control), 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 
and 4.0 mg (in acetone) for 34 weeks to groups of 40 male and 40 female SENCAR mice pre-treated 
(one week earlier) with a dermal dose of 50.5 μg 
benzo[ a]pyrene. Skin papilloma incidence was 
reported to increase from 3–100% over the dose 
range of the coke-oven main sample tested. No 
papillomas were observed in the control groups (Nesnow et al., 1983 ).
The tumour-initiating activity of both samples 
mentioned above was studied with groups of 40 male and 40 female SENCAR mice that were 
skin-painted once with 0 (control), 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 
2.0 or 10 mg of each sample dissolved in acetone. The 10-mg dose was administered in split doses of 
2.0 mg each for 5 days. Beginning one week later, 
2 μg of 12- O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate 
were administered topically, twice weekly. The 
incidence of skin papillomas and carcinomas 
was reported after six months and one year, respectively. Both the topside and main samples 
produced dose-related increases in both papil -
lomas and carcinomas. For the topside sample, 
the papilloma incidence ranged from 10–100% 
and the carcinoma incidence was 0–20%, while 
170Coke production
for the coke-oven main sample, the incidence of 
papillomas ranged from 31–100% and of carci -
nomas from 10–65%. In the control groups, the incidences of papillomas and carcinomas ranged from 5–8% and 0–5%, respectively ( Nesnow 
et al., 1982 , 1983 ).
3.2 Inhalation
3.2.1  Mouse
The carcinogenicity of coke-oven tar (from a 
USA by-product coke oven) was investigated in 
C3H mice. In the untreated control group, all 30 
mice survived for the duration of the experiment (71 weeks) and did not develop any squamous-cell 
tumours of the lung. A second group of 33 mice 
was exposed to a coal-tar aerosol at 300 mg/m
3 
for two hours daily, three times weekly, during 
weeks 35–71 of the experiment. Five squamous-
cell tumours of the lung, one of which was malig -
nant, occurred in this group ( Horton et al., 1963 ).
In another experiment, the tar (Tar 1) from 
the same source as that in the study by Horton et 
al. (1963)  and another tar (Tar 2) were separated 
into phenolic (P-Tar) and non-phenolic (N-Tar) fractions. Both tars were derived from USA by-product coke ovens. Aerosols were produced 
from these fractions and animals were exposed 
to the aerosols, separate or in combination, at 120–200 mg/m
3, three times per week for 55 
weeks. Six groups of 50 male C3H/HeJ mice were 
treated with air only (control) or with aerosols of 
Tar 1, N-Tar 1, N-Tar 1 + P-Tar 1, N-Tar 1 + P-Tar 2 or N-Tar 2 + P-Tar 1. The experiment was termi -
nated at 55 weeks. Lung tumours were recorded in animals that survived beyond 46 weeks. Lung-adenoma incidence was 0/32 (control), 12/13, 
16/20, 14/19, 14/25 and 14/23, respectively. Lung-
adenocarcinoma incidence was 0/32 (control), 3/13, 0/20, 1/19, 1/25, 0/23, respectively ( Tye & 
Stemmer, 1967 ).
Groups of 75 CAF
1-JAX and 75 ICR-CF1 
female mice were exposed for 90 days to concen -
trations of coal-tar aerosol of 0.2, 2.0 and 10 mg/m3 (99% of the droplets were ≤ 5 μm in size), and were observed for a further 21 weeks. The aerosol 
consisted of a composite mixture of benzene/
toluene/xylene fractions of coal tars collected from the effluents of several different coke ovens 
in the USA. Unexposed controls of each strain of 
mice were included in the study. Lung-tumour data were not available. The incidence of skin 
tumours [not further specified] was 1/61, 14/75 
and 44/55, respectively, in the exposed ICR-CF1 mice, and 3/225 in the controls. In the exposed 
groups of CAF
1-JAX mice, the skin-tumour inci -
dences were 0/75, 3/65 and 18/43, respectively, with 0/225 in the controls ( MacEwen et al., 1976 ). 
[The Working Group noted the lack of solvent 
controls.]
A group of 75 female ICR-CF1 mice and 
a group of 50 female CAF
1-JAX mice were 
exposed to the coal-tar aerosol described above 
at a concentration of 10 mg/m3 for six hours per 
day, five days per week, for 18 months; unex -
posed controls of both strains were available. 
Alveologenic carcinomas were observed in 26/61 exposed ICR-CF1 mice, 27/50 exposed CAF
1-JAX 
mice, 3/68 ICR-CF1 controls and 8/48 CAF1-JAX 
controls. The exposed and control groups did not 
differ in the incidence of other types of tumours, 
including skin tumours ( MacEwen et al ., 1976 ). 
[The Working Group noted the lack of solvent 
controls.]
3.2.2  Rat
A group of 40 male and a group of 40 female 
CFE strain Sprague-Dawley weanling rats were exposed to the aerosol described above at a 
concentration of 10 mg/m
3 for six hours per 
day, five days per week, for 18 months; 40 male 
and 40 female unexposed controls were avail -
able. Among treated rats, 38/38 males and 31/38 
females developed squamous-cell carcinomas of 
the lung. In the control groups, no such tumours 
were observed in 36 males and 37 females (MacEwen et al ., 1976 ). [The Working Group 
noted the lack of solvent controls.]
171IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
4. Other Relevant Data
4.1 Mechanistic evidence relevant 
to the carcinogenic hazard from 
occupational exposures during 
coke production
4.1.1  Experimental systems
Experimental studies of the effects of expo -
sure to coke-oven emissions have been evaluated 
in previous IARC Monographs  (IARC, 1984 , 
1987 , 2010 ). Emissions from coke ovens were 
mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium  TA98 
and TA100, both with and without exogenous 
metabolic activation, and in several mammalian cell systems: L5178Y mouse lymphoma Tk
+/- cells 
with and without metabolic activation, Chinese 
hamster ovary cells (6-thioguanine resistance), 
and BALB/c 3T3 cells (ouabain resistance). Coke-oven emissions induced DNA strand-breakage 
in Syrian hamster embryo cells, and sister chro -
matid exchange in Chinese hamster ovary cells 
with and without exogenous metabolic activa -
tion. These emissions also caused morphological transformation in BALB/c 3T3 cells without activation.
PAHs are a component of coke-oven mixtures 
and many carcinogenic PAHs are genotoxic in in-vitro  and in-vivo  bioassay systems. Examples 
are benz[ a]anthracene, benzo[ a]pyrene, benzo[ c]
phenanthrene, benzo[ b]fluoranthene, and 
benzo[ j]fluoranthene ( IARC, 1984 ). Many of the 
genotoxic effects induced by coke-oven emissions in experimental systems have also been found after exposure to individual carcinogenic PAHs 
(IARC, 1983 ; Osborne & Crosby, 1987 ; Harvey, 
1991 ). The extent to which PAHs contribute to 
the genotoxic activity of coke-oven emissions is not known, but the available evidence strongly 
suggests that they do make a contribution. Some insight into the role of PAHs in genotoxicity 
and cancer associated with coke production can be obtained from DNA-adduct studies in 
experimental animals exposed to coke-oven 
emissions. In rats exposed to such emissions by 
inhalation one major adduct was detected by the [
32P]-postlabelling procedure. This adduct 
had the same chromatographic mobility as the 
major anti-benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-oxide-
(BPDE)- N2-deoxyguanosine adduct resulting 
from incubation of anti-benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-
diol-9,10-oxide with calf thymus DNA. This 
adduct was observed in DNA from lung, heart, and liver of the exposed rats. However, the auto -
radiograms also showed evidence of a complex mixture of unidentified aromatic adducts (Binková et al ., 1994 ). Mice topically exposed to 
coke-oven emissions showed some evidence of the formation of a BPDE-DNA adduct ( Lewtas et al., 
1993 ). Although the studies in exposed rats and 
mice provided some evidence with respect to an anti-benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-oxide adduct, 
many other DNA adducts remained unidentified 
and their contribution to the total DNA-adduct 
profile cannot be ascertained. In addition, these DNA-adduct studies are dependent on the avail -
ability of fully characterized PAH-DNA adduct standards and in many [
32P]-postlabelling exper -
iments only the anti-benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-diol-
9,10-oxide-DNA adduct was used as a reference. This adduct has been correlated with specific mutations in the oncogene, K
i-Ras, found in 
lung tumours induced by benzo[ a]pyrene in 
mice ( Ross & Nesnow, 1999 ). Moreover, Ki-RAS  
mutations are common in human lung tumours 
(Vineis & Caporaso, 1995 ).
4.1.2  Humans
As was previously reported ( IARC, 1987 ), 
peripheral blood lymphocytes of coke-oven workers had increased frequencies of sister 
chromatid exchange (SCE) compared with age-matched controls. Also, in one study the urine of 
coke-oven workers was mutagenic in Salmonella 
typhimurium  in the presence of an exogenous 
172Coke production
metabolic system. Numerous subsequent studies 
largely confirmed these results. 
In an Italian study, no differences in frequen -
cies of chromosome aberrations and micronuclei were found in cultured lymphocytes of 92 coke-
oven workers in a steel-production plant and a 
group of 19 controls from a non-oven plant in the same area ( Forni et al ., 1996 ). In Germany, 
a group of 29 coke-oven workers and a control group were studied for frequencies of DNA single-strand breaks, DNA–protein crosslinks (meas -
ured with an alkaline filter-elution assay), SCE, and DNA adducts in lymphocytes. DNA strand-breaks in lymphocytes of coke-oven workers 
were significantly higher than in controls ( Popp 
et al ., 1997 ). Eleven of 31 male non-smoking 
coke-oven workers in Poland produced urine that was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium  
strain YG1024 in the presence of an exogenous 
source of metabolic activation, compared with 
urine samples of 31 male non-smoking controls 
(Simioli et al ., 2004 ). 8-Oxodeoxyguanosine 
levels in white blood cells and the amount of 
DNA damage (measured with the comet assay) 
in lymphocytes were higher in 20 German coke-oven workers than in 55 controls ( Marczynski 
et al ., 2002 ). Urinary 8-oxodeoxyguanosine 
concentrations were higher in 55 Taiwan, Chinaese topside coke-oven workers than in 162 
side-oven workers ( Wu et al ., 2003 ). In another 
study from Taiwan, China, elevated levels of 
8-oxodeoxyguanosine in urine, micronuclei 
in lymphocytes, and glutathione S -transferase 
in serum were found in 47 workers exposed to 
coke-oven emissions, compared with the levels 
in 31 controls ( Liu et al ., 2006 ). In a study of 
49 Polish coke-oven workers the micronucleus 
frequency in peripheral blood lymphocytes was 
related to specific anti-benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-diol-
9,10-oxide-DNA-adduct formation in the same 
subject ( Pavanello et al ., 2008a ). Chinese coke-
oven workers ( n = 141) had higher frequencies of 
micronuclei, nucleoplasmic bridges, and nuclear buds compared with the values in 66 controls; the number of nucleoplasmic bridges and nuclear buds correlated with 1-hydroxypyrene concen -
trations in urine ( Duan et al., 2009 ). 
A significant correlation was found between 
the concentrations of 1-hydroxypyrene and 
8-oxodeoxyguanosine in urine from a group 
of 91 coke-oven workers in Taiwan, China, compared with 49 controls ( Hu et al ., 2004 ), 
while a Japanese/Chinese study of 119 coke oven workers and 37 controls could not find a corre -
lation between 8-oxodeoxyguanosine levels in 
leukocytes and 1-hydroxypyrene concentrations 
in urine ( Zhang et al ., 2003 ). In a group of 37 
German coke-oven workers the level of 8-oxode -
oxyguanosine and the number of DNA strand-breaks (measured with the comet assay) were higher than in 48 controls ( Marczynski et al ., 
2009 ). 
The mutant frequency at the HPRT  locus 
(6-thioguanine resistance) in lymphocytes from 
a population of 43 Italian coke-oven workers was 
increased compared with the frequency in 26 non-exposed controls, but the difference was not 
significant. The percentages of the different types 
of gene alteration were also similar in exposed and non-exposed subjects, based on an analysis 
of mutations in 161 HPRT  clones derived from the 
two groups. Only the frequency of splice muta -
tions in mutant clones derived from coke-oven workers was significantly higher than in controls 
(Zanesi et al., 1998 ). No difference in the plasma 
concentrations of either p53 (mutated or wild-
type) or p21(WAF1) protein was found between 
66 coke-oven workers and 44 controls in the Czech Republic, but significantly higher amounts 
of these proteins were found in the subgroup 
exposed to carcinogenic PAHs at concentrations of < 1 μg/m
3 compared with the group exposed 
to carcinogenic PAHs > 1 μg/m3. Overall, a nega -
tive correlation between the concentration of p53 
protein in plasma and personal exposure to carci -
nogenic PAHs was found ( Rössner et al ., 2003 ). 
In another study from the Czech Republic, cyto-genetic markers (chromosomal aberrations, SCE, 
173IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
cells with a high frequency of SCE, the hetero-
geneity index SCE, and polymorphism of the 
genes GSTM1  and NAT2 ) were evaluated in the 
peripheral lymphocytes of 64 coke-oven workers 
and 34 control subjects from the same plant. 
All the cytogenetic markers were significantly 
increased in the exposed workers compared with the control group, also when smoking status was 
taken into account. No effects of the GSTM1  and 
NAT2  genotypes on the cytogenetic markers 
were noted ( Kalina et al., 1998 ). 
The effect of polymorphisms in genes 
involved in DNA repair was evaluated by means 
of the comet assay in isolated peripheral blood 
lymphocytes from 94 coke-oven workers in 
North-eastern China and 64 controls. One of the XRCC1  genotypes, Arg399Gln, was associ -
ated with an increased frequency of micronuclei in the coke-oven workers ( Cheng et al., 2009 ).
Coke-oven workers have been extensively 
studied for the presence of biomarkers of expo -
sure, in some cases with mixed results due to methodological issues, small sample size, inter -
individual variability, and confounding factors, such as smoking and diet. However, there are several key studies that show clear relationships 
between exposures to coke-oven emissions and 
certain biomarkers. The literature is dominated by studies that examined anti-benzo[ a]pyrene-
7,8-diol-9,10-oxide-DNA adducts as a biomarker of exposure. The amount of this adduct has been found to be increased in peripheral 
blood lymphocytes of male coke-oven workers 
compared with controls in several studies of different worker populations ( Pavanello et al ., 
1999a , 2004 ; Chen et al ., 2003 ). In some of these 
studies, analysis of genetic polymorphisms showed that the GSTM1-null  detoxifying geno -
type and some low-activity nucleotide excision-repair (NER) genotypes were associated with higher anti-benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-oxide-
DNA-adduct formation ( Pavanello et al ., 1999b , 
2004 , 2005 ). In 35 Dutch coke-oven workers a significant 
induction of aromatic DNA adducts in lympho -
cytes and of micronuclei in exfoliated urothe -
lial cells was found compared with the levels in 37 controls ( van D elft et al ., 2001 ). When 
89 French coke-oven workers were compared with 18 power-plant workers with respect to anti-benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-oxide-DNA-
adduct levels and genetic polymorphisms in the CYP1A1 , GSTM1  and GSTT1  genes, higher 
numbers of DNA adducts were detected in 
individuals with the combined CYP1A1(1/*2  or 
*2A/*2A)-GSTM1-null  genotype ( Rojas et al ., 
2000 ). In Polish coke-oven workers the influence 
was studied of four polymorphisms of nucleo -
tide excision-repair genes and of GSTM1  on 
anti-benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-oxide-DNA-
adduct levels in lymphocytes and monocytes. 
The increase in DNA-adduct levels was signifi -
cantly related to lack of GSTM1 activity and to 
the low nucleotide excision-repair capacity of the 
XPC-PAT
+/+ genotype ( Pavanello et al ., 2005 ). In 
other studies by the same group, anti-benzo[ a]
pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-oxide-DNA-adduct levels were significantly increased in peripheral blood lymphocytes of coke-oven workers compared 
with controls, after adjustment for smoking 
status and diet ( Pavanello et al ., 2004 , 2008a ). 
In one study from China, formation of the anti-
benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-oxide-albumin 
adduct was associated with exposure to coke-
oven emissions, after adjustment for smoking 
status ( Wang et al., 2007 ). 
Based on the available evidence from studies 
in experimental systems, coke-oven emissions are mutagenic in bacteria and in mammalian 
cells, induce DNA damage, SCE, and morpho -
logical cell transformation. DNA-adduct data 
from experimental studies suggest that coke-
oven emissions produce a complex mixture of aromatic adducts, one being identified as 
anti-benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-oxide- N
2-de-
oxyguanosine. Genotoxic effects of exposures to coke-oven emissions have been studied in 
174Coke production
surrogate tissues from populations in industrial 
settings. Measured end-points include 8-oxode -
oxyguanosine levels, DNA strand-breaks, SCE, micronuclei, chromosomal aberrations, and urinary mutagenicity. The increased 8-oxode -
oxyguanosine levels reflect increased oxidative stress. This could be a result of redox cycling of PAH quinones and the damaging effects of reac -
tive intermediates on cellular antioxidant levels (Joseph & Jaiswal, 1998 ; Klaunig & Kamendulis, 
2004 ; Park et al., 2009 ).
Chronic exposure to PAH in Polish non-
smoking coke-oven workers induced both gene-specific (e.g. in the TP53  gene) and global 
methylation changes in peripheral blood lymphocytes. These changes were correlated with BPDE-DNA adduct levels and micronuclei 
in the same subjects ( Pavanello et al., 2009 ).
4.2 Synthesis
Overall, these data strongly indicate a muta -
genic/genotoxic mode of action for occupational exposures during coke production, based on 
experimental and human studies. The data also identify lung as a target, given the major route 
of human exposure, based on both experimental 
and human studies. There is ample mechanistic support for the respiratory carcinogenic effects 
of occupational exposures during coke produc -
tion in humans, in part through analysis of 
exposure to benzo[ a]pyrene. This is based on 
direct measurement of anti-benzo[ a]pyrene-
7,8-diol-9,10-oxide-DNA adducts in peripheral blood lymphocytes (surrogate tissue) and on the 
identification of genotoxic effects consistent with 
those induced by anti-benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-diol-
9,10-oxide or benzo[ a]pyrene. It is also consistent 
with the known carcinogenic activity of this epoxide in lung tissues in experimental animals. Moreover, the influence of GST  polymorphisms 
on levels of anti-benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-
oxide-DNA adducts is suggestive of the presence of reactive electrophilic intermediates, such as anti-benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-oxide. Since 
coke-oven emissions are complex mixtures, these exposures could have more than one underlying 
mechanism of action. The fact that chronic 
exposure to PAH in Polish non-smoking coke-oven workers induced both gene-specific (e.g. in 
the TP53  gene) and global methylation changes 
in peripheral blood lymphocytes, suggests an 
epigenetic mechanism. 
5. Evaluation
There is sufficient evidence  in humans for 
the carcinogenicity of coke production. Coke 
production causes cancer of the lung.
There is sufficient  evidence in experimental 
animals for the carcinogenicity of samples of tar taken from coke ovens.
There is strong evidence for a genotoxic 
mechanism underlying the effects of occupa -
tional exposures during coke production, based 
on both experimental and human studies. 
The detection of anti-benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-
diol-9,10-epoxide-DNA adducts in the periph -
eral blood lymphocytes in exposed populations suggests the participation of benzo[ a]pyrene in 
the genotoxic mechanism for this exposure in humans.
Coke production is carcinogenic to humans

1781791. Exposure Data
1.1 Identification of the agent
Mineral oils (also known as base oils, mineral 
base oils or lubricant base oils) are chemical 
substances prepared from naturally occurring 
crude petroleum oil. Crude oil is distilled first at atmospheric pressure and then under high 
vacuum to yield vacuum distillates and residual 
fractions that can be further refined to mineral oils. Mineral oils refined from petroleum crude 
oils are complex and variable mixtures of 
straight and branched-chain paraffinic, naph -
thenic (cycloparaffinic), and aromatic hydrocar -
bons having carbon numbers of 15 or more and boiling points in the range of 300–600°C ( IARC, 
1984 ).
Mineral oils are described by several dozen 
generic “petroleum stream” Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) numbers. Many mineral oils may 
have more than one CAS number because different 
refiners submitted slightly different descriptions for similar refining streams when CAS numbers 
were being assigned (both in the United States of 
America and Europe) ( CONCAWE, 1997 ).The hydrocarbon composition and physical 
characteristics of a mineral oil depend on both 
the composition of the original crude oil and 
the processes used during refining (e.g. solvent extraction, hydro-treatment) ( CONCAWE, 
1997 ). Production processes of mineral oils have 
changed substantially over time ( IARC, 1987 ; 
Tolbert, 1997 ). In the past, many mineral oils 
were only mildly refined and contained signifi -
cant levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocar -
bons (PAHs). Acid treatment was initially used 
to remove PAHs and other impurities and to 
improve the technical properties of the finished oils. In recent decades, acid treatment has largely 
been replaced by extensive refining with solvent 
extraction and/or hydro-treatment, which has further reduced the level of PAHs and other 
contaminants. Mineral oils have been produced 
by means of the severe hydro-treatment proce -
dure since the 1960s ( Kane et al. , 1984 ; Mackerer 
et al. , 2003 ). Regulatory pressures in the USA 
further encouraged the move to highly refined mineral oils in the mid-1980s ( Woskie et al ., 
2003 ).
There are several assays that can be used to 
determine if a mineral oil is highly or severely 
refined ( Mackerer et al ., 2003 ). Two useful MINERAL OILS, UNTREATED OR MILDLY 
TREATED
Mineral oils were considered by previous IARC Working Groups in 1983 and 1987 ( IARC, 
1984 , 1987 ). Since that time new data have become available, which have been incorpo -
rated in this Monograph , and taken into consideration in the present evaluation.IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
short-term assays that are widely used by mineral-
oil manufacturers are the modified Ames test 
(ASTM, 1996 ) and the IP346 assay ( Institute for 
Petroleum, 1985 , 1993 ; CONCAW E , 1994 ). The 
modified Ames test measures the amount of extractable mutagenic activity in a mineral-oil 
sample; mineral oils with a mutagenicity index ≤  1.0 in this assay are considered highly or severely 
refined. The IP346 assay measures the amount 
of material extractable in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO): mineral oils with a DMSO-extractable 
content < 3% in the IP346 assay are considered 
highly or severely refined. Naphthenic mineral oils tend to have higher non-mutagenic DMSO 
extractables and some naphthenic oils can give 
a false-positive result in the IP346 assay. The modified Ames test can give conclusive results if 
the outcome of the IP346 assay is high.
1.2 Uses
A wide variety of mineral oil-containing 
products including lubricants as well as products intended for non-lubricant purposes are manu -
factured for different applications. Lubricant 
products include engine oils, transmission 
fluids, gear oils, hydraulic fluids, as well as metal -
working fluids (also known as metal-removal 
fluids). Metalworking fluids may be different 
from other mineral oil-containing products due 
to the types of additives used, the additive treat -
ment rates, and contaminants – including those 
of microbial origin – that are associated with use. 
“Non-lubricant” products include agricultural spray oils, printing inks, tyre oils, etc. Oil mists 
or aerosols can arise from the use of mineral oil 
both as lubricant and as non-lubricant. In prac -
tice, oil aerosols may be generated by several 
mechanisms such as aeration, contact with a 
fast-moving surface, or by heating. Important applications associated with potential genera -
tion of oil aerosols are metal-working, textile machinery, rock drills, aerosol lubrication, agri -
culture sprays, concrete mould release agents, corrosion preventatives, printing inks, rubber extenders, lubricant-blending in open processes, 
and applications in food and pharmaceutical 
preparations ( CONCAWE, 1986 ; Urbanus et al ., 
2003 ; ACGIH, 2007 ). The particle size of the 
mists, aerosols or fogs is likely to differ for each of these processes ( IARC, 1984 ).
1.3 Human exposure
1.3.1  Occupational exposure
There are several occupational environments 
in which an oil mist can be generated. In these 
situations the opportunities for dermal expo -
sure or inhalation exposure, with concomitant 
ingestion, are substantial. Such occupations 
include metalworking, printing-press operating, 
and cotton- and jute-spinning ( Tolbert, 1997 ). 
According to the US National Occupational 
Exposure Survey (1981–83), approximately 
1 million workers (including approximately 390,000 women) in the USA were potentially 
exposed to mineral oil ( NIOSH, 1990 ).
A small number of studies have evalu -
ated respiratory morbidity from exposure to mineral-oil mist among newspaper pressmen, 
marine engineers, cable oilers, and tunnel blasters. Mineral-oil aerosol concentrations 
in these studies ranged from approximately 
0.3 mg/m
3 (Bakke et al ., 2001 ) to about 3 mg/m3 
(Skyberg et al., 1992 ; Svendsen & Hilt, 1997 , 1999 ; 
Bukowski, 2003 ). Values of up to >20 mg/m3 were 
recorded in earlier studies ( Goldstein et al., 1970 ).
Ambient mineral-oil mist concentrations 
were measured in the engine rooms of ships: the typical lubricating oil (b.p. 300–700°C) is 
a solvent-refined mineral oil containing paraf -
fins, cycloparaffins, aromatic hydrocarbons, and 
additives. The air concentrations of oil mist in 
the engine rooms of different ships varied from 
not detectable to 0.53 mg/m
3 (mean 0.24 mg/m3). 
The levels of hydrocarbons varied from 0.2 to 
180Mineral oils, untreated or mildly treated
14.5 mg/m3 (Svendsen & Børresen, 1999 ). [The 
level of refinement of these oils was not reported.]
1.3.2  Non-occupational exposure
The non-occupationally involved general 
population may be exposed to mineral oils 
through ingestion of contaminated foodstuffs. 
In a study conducted in Switzerland, Grob et 
al. (2001)  analysed mineral oil in the fat or in a 
raw extract from animal feed or foodstuffs. The average concentration in the feed was 100 mg/kg, with a maximum of 1000 mg/kg, 25 mg/kg in 
animal body fat (maximum, 150 mg/kg) and 
30 mg/kg in the fat phase of eggs (maximum, 80 mg/kg). Paraffin oil is used for feed production, 
which may account for part of the contamination 
problem (e.g. in eggs). [The level of refinement of these mineral oils was not reported.]
2. Cancer in Humans
2.1 Introduction
Mineral oils comprise a diverse set of agents 
used for a wide range of industrial operations. 
There is evidence that mineral oils vary in their 
potential to cause cancer with the degree of treat -
ment or processing. Hydro-treatment and solvent 
extraction reduce the PAH content, and thus the 
carcinogenicity of the oils. Untreated and mildly treated oils have been classified as Group-1 
carcinogens, with sufficient evidence  from studies 
in humans that mineral oils (containing various 
additives and impurities) that have been used 
in occupations such as mule-spinning, metal 
machining and jute-processing are carcinogenic to humans.
A major challenge in making an overall 
assessment of the carcinogenicity of mineral oils is this diversity in processing, with incom -
plete information on the extent of processing in specific industrial applications. Mineral oils are typically used as part of a complex mixture for such applications as metalworking, lubrica -
tion, and cooling. The additional processing and combining with other agents makes attribu -
tion of risk specifically to mineral oils difficult 
(Woskie et al., 2003 ).
2.2 Cancer of the skin/scrotum
The evidence from a series of case reports 
and case series for skin cancer, particularly of the scrotum, over the period from the early 
1900s through the 1960s, was reviewed in IARC Monograph  Volume 34 ( IARC, 1984 ). Five large 
case series of mule-spinners had been reported, each with over 100 scrotal cancers ( Green, 1910 ; 
Southam & Wilson, 1922 ; Henry & Irvine, 1936 ; 
Henry, 1947 ), with sizable numbers of cases in 
other exposed populations. Despite the inherent limitations in case series as a source of informa -
tion, the numbers of cases observed, the rarity of scrotal cancer, and the intensity of the direct exposure of the skin in these jobs during that time 
period render these case series highly informa -
tive. Scrotal cancer is virtually pathognomonic 
for occupational exposure, in part as a result of 
these historical case series.
Over the intervening period since the 1960s 
nothing has challenged the assessment of suffi -
cient evidence  of human carcinogenicity based on 
the historical evidence pertaining to skin cancer. 
In a cohort of 792 Swedish metalworkers exposed 
to oil mist there were four cases of scrotal cancer, 
all among 242 men employed as turners, versus 0 expected overall ( Järvholm et al ., 1981 ). The 
same group ( Järvholm et al., 1985)  reported on a 
cohort of 682 bearing-ring industry workers and found working as a lathe operator to be asso -
ciated with scrotal cancer (four observed, 0.3 expected, P < 0.001). Zhao et al.  (2005)  studied 
a cohort of 5049 male aerospace workers in the 
USA and found a significantly increased risk 
for skin melanoma (see Table  2.1 available at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/
181IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
vol100F/100F-14-Table2.1.pdf ). Case series 
indicative of an increased risk for scrotal cancer 
continue to be published based on historical 
exposures. Pressmen working in a wax-manufac -
turing department in an oil refinery in the USA 
had a marked excess of scrotal cancer based on 11 
cases in men working >10 years during the period 1937–56, which corresponds to a crude rate of 
806 per 100,000 relative to a general population 
rate estimated at 0.15 per 100,000 ( Hendricks 
et al ., 1959 ). Tool setters and tool fitters in the 
West Midlands area of England showed notably elevated risk for scrotal cancer over the period 1936–1976 ( Waldron et al., 1984 ). 
Several epidemiological studies were able to 
detect the expected increased risk for skin cancer in general, or scrotal cancer in particular, but 
since these cancers are rarely fatal, studies based 
on cancer mortality were of limited use to address the question. Roush et al . (1982)  studied squa -
mous-cell carcinoma of the scrotum in a case–control study in Connecticut, USA, among men diagnosed between 1935 and 1973 (see Table 2.2 
available at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/
Monographs/vol100F/100F-14-Table2.2.pdf ). 
Occupations associated with exposure to cutting 
oils, including tool or machine setters, screw-
machine operators, machinists, and machine operators, were examined and showed an odds 
ratio of 10.5 (95%CI: 4.0–36.9). 
2.3 Other cancers
The more rigorous epidemiological studies 
pertain to the occupations in which mineral oils are used in various formulations and in different 
degrees, including metal workers, machinists, jute workers, and others. Given the time period 
and setting, the mineral oils studied were likely 
to be highly treated. At the time of the previous IARC Monograph  there were several studies of 
workers in these industries, mostly based solely on job title and industry of employment and limited in detail regarding exposure ( IARC, 1984 ). Exposure to mineral oil was inferred 
based solely on job title or self-reported exposure. 
Whereas dermal exposure is the primary route of 
exposure for skin/scrotal cancer, for other sites and under improved hygienic conditions, aero -
sols are of equal or greater concern.
Focusing on studies that made attempts to 
address exposure to mineral oil directly, there 
has been sporadic and inconsistent support 
for an association with bladder cancer ( Ugnat 
et al ., 2004 ; Friesen et al ., 2009 ; see Table  2.3 
available at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100F/100F-14-Table2.3.pdf  and 
Table 2.4 at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/
Monographs/vol100F/100F-14-Table2.4.pdf ), 
stomach cancer ( Zhao et al ., 2005 ; see Table 2.5 
at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/
vol100F/100F-14-Table2.5.pdf  and Table 2.6 at 
http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/
vol100F/100F-14-Table2.6.pdf ), rectal cancer 
(Gerhardsson de V erdier et al ., 1992 ; Eisen 
et al ., 2001 ; see Table 2.7 at http://monographs.
iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100F/100F-14-
Table2.7.pdf  and Table 2.8 at http://monographs.
iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100F/100F-14-
Table2.8.pdf ), pancreatic cancer ( Yassi et al ., 
2003 ), sinonasal cancers ( Roush et al ., 1980 ), 
laryngeal cancer ( Ahrens et al., 1991 ; Eisen et al., 
1992 ), and lung cancer ( Rønneberg et al ., 1988 ; 
Acquavella et al ., 1993 ; see Table  2.9, available 
at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/
vol100F/100F-14-Table2.9.pdf  and Table 2.10 at 
http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100F/100F-14-Table2.10.pdf ). Individual 
studies have suggested that mineral oil may be 
related to a range of other cancers, including 
those of the larynx and pancreas, based on studies of metal-workers and related manufac -
turing occupations. For each of these, however, there are studies of equal or higher quality that do not show associations, and in many cases 
there are inconsistent results within the same 
study across exposure indices. There have been varyious interpretations of the strength of the 
182Mineral oils, untreated or mildly treated
evidence linking exposure to metalworking 
fluids to a range of cancer sites ( Tolbert, 1997 ; 
Calvert et al., 1998 ; Mirer, 2003 ; Savitz, 2003 ). The 
diversity in exposures to other agents, including synthetic oils and contaminants, and the pres -
ence of accompanying unrelated occupational exposures make the relevance of many studies tenuous in the assessment of the carcinogenic 
hazards of exposures to mineral oils.
Lung cancer is the most extensively investi -
gated cancer in these occupations. While there are several studies supporting an association with 
exposed workers in certain occupations ( Coggon 
et al ., 1984 ; Rønneberg et al ., 1988 ; Acquavella 
et al., 1993 ; Droste et al., 1999 ; Zhao et al., 2005 ), 
the exposures are not generally to mineral oils alone, given the use of other compounds in the 
metal-working trade (see Table 2.9, online), the 
most detailed study did not show an association (Schroeder et al ., 1997 ; Eisen et al ., 2001 ), and 
smoking was not controlled for in some of the studies that did show an association ( Coggon 
et al ., 1984 ; Zhao et al ., 2005 ; see Table  2.10 
online).
The case–control studies have typically been 
better able to address confounding, whereas the 
cohort studies have tended to examine expo -
sure in more detail. However, even in the most 
sophisticated studies, it was not possible to isolate 
highly-treated from untreated or mildly-treated 
oils, nor are mineral oils used in isolation from other agents. As noted in several reviews ( Tolbert, 
1997 ; Woskie et al., 2003 ), in metal-working there 
is concomitant exposure to a range of chemicals including biocides, metal dusts, and by-products 
of oil heating. Even in the study of the Michigan 
automobile-manufacturing workers – the most detailed study of metal-workers – the authors 
identified categories of exposure to straight-
chain and soluble lubricating fluids, but were not able to separate or characterize mineral-oil 
exposures in particular ( Eisen et al., 1992 ).2.4 Synthesis
There is consistent evidence that untreated or 
mildly-treated mineral oils cause cancer of the skin, specifically of the scrotum, in humans. The 
association is highly unlikely to be due to chance, bias, or confounding, given the large case series, 
supportive epidemiological studies, the rarity 
of scrotal cancer, and the intensity of exposure during the period of interest.
There were insufficient data regarding cancer 
at other sites to draw conclusions on the carcino -
genicity in humans for untreated, mildly-treated, 
or highly-treated mineral oils. Recent studies 
did address highly-treated mineral oils, but were limited in their assessment of this agent, instead 
addressing all aspects of the work environment. 
Exposure to mineral oils in metal-working and other industries has not been easy to assess, and 
other agents of concern are known to be present 
in such work environments. Given these limi -
tations in assessing exposure to mineral oils, 
and the lack of consistency in study findings by 
cancer site, the evidence for carcinogenicity of highly-treated mineral oils remains insufficient 
to draw conclusions.
3. Cancer in Experimental Animals
Petroleum-derived base oils and formulated 
products have been tested for their potential carcinogenicity in mice and other experimental 
animals, by skin application, in feeding studies, by inhalation exposure, and by subcutaneous and 
intra-peritoneal injection. In IARC Monograph  
Volume 33 ( IARC, 1984 ), the Working Group 
divided petroleum materials into eight classes plus two subclasses (6.2, 7.2) based on the extent 
of refinement. Class 8 covers petroleum-derived materials not otherwise classified, and this cate -
gory is not considered in this Monograph . This 
categorization scheme is still useful and applied here despite the fact that the terminology used 
183IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
to describe the material tested in recent studies 
may not be easily conducive to allocate it to a 
given class. Table 3.1  presents the most repre -
sentative animal cancer bioassays with mineral 
oils evaluated in IARC Monograph  Volume 33 
(IARC, 1984 ), as well as studies published since 
that time.
3.1 Earlier studies
Vacuum-distillate fractions [class 1], either 
naphthenic or paraffinic in nature, produced a 
significant skin-tumour response. De-waxing of 
these distillates did not appreciably alter their activity ( Halder et al ., 1984 ; IARC, 1984 ; Kane 
et al ., 1984 ). Early studies demonstrated that 
both light and heavy fractions of paraffinic oils induced benign and malignant skin tumours 
(Twort & Ing, 1928 ). De-waxed paraffinic distil -
lates induced both benign and malignant skin 
tumours in mouse skin ( Gradiski et al ., 1983 ). 
Jute-batching oil induced benign and malignant skin tumours and promoted tumours in mice pre-treated with 7,12-dimethylbenz[ a]anthacene 
(Roe et al. , 1967) . 
Acid-treated oils [class 2] of either naphthenic 
or paraffinic origin, induced benign and malig -
nant skin-tumour responses ( Twort & Lyth, 1939 ; 
Bingham et al., 1965 ; Bingham & Horton, 1966 ), 
unless severe acid treatment had been applied 
(Twort & Lyth, 1939 ).
Solvent-refined oils (raffinates) [class 3], either 
naphthenic or paraffinic in nature, generally did not produce skin tumours ( Gradiski et al ., 
1983 ). However, in one study skin application 
of solvent-extracted paraffinic oil induced one malignant tumour, which suggests possible skin 
tumour-inducing activity ( Doak et al., 1983 ).
Hydro-treated oils [class 4], principally 
paraffinic in nature, induced a moderate inci -
dence of skin tumours when treatment of the distillates was mild ( Halder et al., 1984 ; Kane et al., 
1984 ), while no tumour was induced by severely 
hydro-treated oils. The combination of mild hydro-treatment and solvent extraction appears to reduce or eliminate skin tumorigenicity.
White oils and petrolatums [class 5], which 
are produced from oils that have undergone the most severe acid and/or hydro-treatment, 
showed no activity in the skin-tumour bioassay 
(Doak et al ., 1983 ). Single subcutaneous injec -
tion of three different grades of medicinal petro -
latum into mice induced no treatment-related tumours during the following 18 months ( Oser 
et al ., 1965 ). Similarly, a lifetime study in rats 
involving subcutaneous injection of liquid paraffin and yellow petrolatum did not show local tumours, except a single osteosarcoma 
near the site of yellow petrolatum injection 
(Schmähl & Reiter, 1953 ). Intra-peritoneal injec -
tion of two highly refined food-grade mineral 
oils into certain strains of mice induced plasma-
cell neoplasms and reticulum-cell sarcomas (Potter & Boyce, 1962 ; Bober et al ., 1976 ). Mice 
receiving repeated intra-peritoneal injections of liquid paraffin developed peritoneal reticulum-cell sarcomas, plasma-cell leukaemia, myeloid 
leukaemia and lymphocytic leukaemia ( Rask-
Nielsen & Ebbesen, 1965 ). In two feeding studies 
in which three different samples of medicinal-grade petrolatum and liquid paraffin were fed to 
rats for two years at either 2% or 5% of the diet, no significant increase in tumour incidence was 
observed ( Schmähl & Reiter, 1953 ; Oser et al ., 
1965 ). Although the experimental design was 
considered inadequate and the exposure period was short, inhalation of light white naphthenic 
aerosol (100 mg/m
3) by mice, rats, hamsters, 
and rabbits from 6–13 months did not produce 
a significant increase in tumours in any of the 
species tested ( Wagner et al., 1964 ).
Solvent extracts [class 6.1], which are by-prod -
ucts of solvent refining and sometimes called aromatic oils, induced a significant increase in incidence of skin tumours ( Gradiski et al., 1983 ). 
The same response was produced with highly concentrated aromatic extracts of medicinal-grade petrolatums ( Kane et al., 1984 ).

High-boiling fractions from catalyti -
cally cracked oils [class 6.2] – also classified as 
aromatic oils – induced increasing numbers of 
skin tumours in mice with increasing boiling-ranges above 370°C. Further fractionation 
established that the activity is maximal for oils 
boiling at 500–520°C and is concentrated in the aromatic fraction of the oils. High-boiling, cata -
lytically cracked oils also produced skin tumours in rabbits and monkeys ( Smith et al ., 1951 ). 
Additional studies confirmed the increased 
tumorigenic activity of oils with boiling ranges 
370–500°C. Promoting activity was also detected for some oil fractions in mice and rabbits ( Shubik 
& Saffiotti, 1955 ; Saffiotti & Shubik, 1963 ).
Unused gasoline-engine oil [class 7.1] applied 
in several studies to mouse skin did not give a 
tumorigenic response with the exception of one 
single tumour ( Saffiotti & Shubik, 1963 ; Kane 
et al ., 1984 ). Mice exposed via inhalation to 
unused diesel-engine oil for 11 months exhib -
ited no increase in tumour incidence ( Lushbaugh 
et al., 1950 ). In contrast, unused cutting oils (also 
class 7.1), which are often formulated products consisting of blends of base oils and chemical additives, produced skin tumours ( Gilman & 
Vesselinovitch, 1955 ; Jepsen et al., 1977 ).
Used gasoline-engine oil [class 7.2] had 
stronger tumorigenic activity than unused 
oil; solvent extraction of polyaromatic hydro -
carbons almost eliminated the tumorigenic 
activity ( Grimmer et al ., 1982a ). Similarly, used 
cutting oil [also class 7.2] tended to be more active than a comparable, unused oil ( Gilman & 
Vesselinovitch, 1955 ; Jepsen et al., 1977 ).
3.2 Studies published since the 
previous evaluation
Studies conducted since IARC Monograph  
Volume 33 ( IARC, 1984 ) show a marked improve -
ment in experimental design and reporting, 
and confirmed previous findings. Exposure to batching oil [class 1] induced benign and malignant skin tumours and promoted tumour 
formation in mice pre-treated with urethane 
(Mehrotra et al., 1987 ; 1988 ). Subsequent studies 
with the same oil reported only benign tumours 
in mice treated with jute-batching oil, which 
occurred with and without pre-treatment with 7,12-dimethylbenz[ a]anthacene ( Agarwal et al ., 
1985 ). Additionally, in mice treated dermally 
with fractions of the same jute-batching oil for 40 weeks, the PAH-containing fractions induced 
tumours only when treatment was followed 
by 12- O-tretradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate 
(Agarwal et al ., 1988 ). Unrefined naphthenic 
crude oil applied to the skin of mice induced papillomas and carcinomas ( McKee et al., 1989 ). 
Dietary exposure to liquid paraffin did not 
induce an increased tumour incidence ( Shoda 
et al., 1997 ).
Both mild and severe hydro-treatments of 
naphthenic oils [class 4] eliminate the tumori -
genicity, which is associated with a decrease in 
PAH content ( McKee et al ., 1989 ). Despite the 
association, PAH content alone was not consid -
ered predictive of carcinogenicity.
Most tumours observed after exposure to 
white oils and petrolatums [class 5] produced from oils that have undergone the most severe acid and/or hydrogen treatment, were papillomas 
and to a lesser extent squamous cell carcinomas 
(Nessel et al., 1998 , 1999 ).
4. Other relevant data
4.1 Humans
A group of 31 male glassmakers (smokers and 
non-smokers) and a group of suitably matched 
controls exposed to aerosols of mineral oils were 
examined for chromosomal abnormalities in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Chromosomal 
damage, including chromatid breaks, chro -
mosome breaks, and chromosome exchanges 
191IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
(di-centrics and reciprocal translocations) were 
increased in the exposed workers compared with 
controls ( Srám et al., 1985 ).
Workers from a cold-rolling steel plant 
(smokers and non-smokers) exposed to mineral oils were examined for mutagenic activity in the 
urine by means of Salmonella typhimurium  strain 
TA98 in the presence of an exogenous source 
of metabolic activation. There was a significant 
difference in urinary mutagenicity between the exposed workers and the controls. While among 
non-smokers the mutagenic activity was not 
increased in exposed compared with unexposed workers, the overall results suggested a syner -
gistic effect of smoking and exposure to mineral oils ( Pasquini et al., 1985 ).
Overall, there is weak evidence on the mech -
anism underlying the effects of exposures to mineral oils in humans. This evidence is based on genotoxic (mutagenic) activity of mineral 
oils in bacteria and a single cytogenetic study of 
glassworkers exposed to aerosols of mineral oils.
4.2 Experimental systems
Samples of vacuum distillates (class 1), 
solvent-refined oils (class 3), hydro-treated oils 
(class 4), used hardening oil (class 7.2) and used 
crankcase oils (class 7.2) were mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium  in the presence and 
absence (class 7.2 only) of an exogenous source of metabolic activation. Samples of a white oil (class 5), a refined steel-hardening oil (class 7.1) 
and of unused crankcase oils (class 7.1) were not 
mutagenic in S. typhimurium  strain TA98 in the 
presence or absence of exogenous metabolic acti -
vation ( IARC, 1984 , 1987 ).
Naphthenic distillates (raw or acid-treated) 
were tested for mutagenicity in the S. typhimu -
rium  assay in the presence and absence of an 
exogenous source of metabolic activation. With metabolic activation, both untreated and acid-
treated naphthenic distillates were mutagenic. The 
naphthenic distillates contained approximately 12% (w/w) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Granella & Clonfero, 1991 ). A series of 15 high-
viscosity mineral oils obtained from naphthenic distillates, including used, recycled and pooled oils, were examined for mutagenic activity in 
the S. typhimurium  assay with strains TA98 and 
TA100 in the presence and absence of an exog -
enous source of metabolic activation. Four of the samples (three acid-treated naphthenic oils 
and one recycled fraction of a used oil) showed significant mutagenic activity in the presence 
metabolic activation ( Granella et al., 1995 ).
An extensive evaluation of the mutagenic 
activities of 13 mineral oils obtained from various processes was conducted with a modi -
fied S. typhimurium  assay. The modification 
consisted of extracting the mineral-oil samples with dimethyl sulfoxide and increasing the 
concentrations of both NADP
+ and the liver 
post-mitochondrial fraction (S9). The mutagenic 
activities of the mineral-oil samples were signifi -
cantly correlated with the amount of 3–7-ring 
polycyclic aromatic compounds for a subgroup 
of oil samples ( Blackburn et al ., 1984 ; Roy et al ., 
1988 ).
Six mineral-oil samples were evaluated in 
a S. typhimurium  assay activated with washed 
liver microsomes from Aroclor-1254-induced 
rats. Five of the six samples were mutagenic. The 
results showed an empirical correlation between 
increasing mutagenicity index, carcinogenicity and the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon content 
of the oils ( Brooks et al., 1995 ).
Three mineral-oil samples (N11, N1, and R1) 
and several fractions of the N1 oil – obtained from silica-gel column chromatography and 
high-performance liquid chromatography – were evaluated by means of 
32P-postlabelling for 
their ability to form DNA adducts after a single 
dermal application on the skin of TO mice. Both 
the R1 and N1 oils had formed unidentified DNA adducts at 24 hours. The 2–3-ring frac -
tion produced more adducts than the 4–6-ring fraction of N1. The adduct levels first increased 
192Mineral oils, untreated or mildly treated
and then decreased with time after treatment 
(Ingram et al., 2000 ).
5. Evaluation
There is sufficient evidence  in humans for the 
carcinogenicity of untreated or mildly treated 
mineral oils. Untreated or mildly treated mineral 
oils cause cancer of the skin (observed in the scrotum).
There is sufficient evidence  in experimental 
animals for the carcinogenicity of untreated vacuum distillates, acid-treated oils, and aromatic 
oils, including extracts from solvent treatment of 
distillates and the high-boiling fraction of cata -
lytically cracked oils [classes 1, 2 and 6].
There is sufficient evidence  in experimental 
animals for the carcinogenicity of mildly hydro-treated oils [class 4].
There is sufficient evidence  in experimental 
animals for the carcinogenicity of used gasoline-engine oil [class 7.2].
There is weak evidence on the mechanism 
underlying the effects in humans of exposures to mineral oils. This evidence is based on genotoxic 
(mutagenic) activity of mineral oils in bacteria 
and a single cytogenetic study of glassworkers exposed to aerosols of mineral oils.
Untreated and mildly treated mineral oils are 
carcinogenic to humans (Group 1).

1961971. Exposure Data
1.1 Identification of the agent
Chem. Abstr. Serv. Reg. No. : 68308-34-9
Chem. Abstr. Serv. Name : Shale oils
Crude shale oil is the product of thermal 
processing of raw oil shale. Oil shale is sedimen -
tary rock containing mainly mineral compo -
nents and organic matter called kerogen, which 
has a low solubility in organic solvents. Oil shale 
has a low boiling-point and it produces liquid organic products (oils) on thermal decomposi -
tion. Crude shale oils differ principally from crude petroleum in that they contain higher 
concentrations of organic nitrogen compounds 
and arsenic. Materials encountered in oil-shale processing include raw oil shale, crude shale oil, 
spent shale, oil-shale ash, synthetic crude oil (or 
‘syncrude’) and refined products. Operations include retorting, upgrading and refining ( IARC, 
1985 ).
Crude shale oils are viscous, waxy liquids 
made up of hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes 
and aromatic compounds) and polar compo -
nents (organic nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur 
compounds). Crude shale oils are very complex mixtures, and only few of the compounds have been identified.
To recover the oil from the shale, its organic 
portion (kerogen) must be decomposed ther -
mally. This thermal decomposition, known as 
retorting, converts the solid organic material of 
the shale into liquid and gaseous fractions and a solid carbonaceous residue. The liquid frac -
tion, the so-called shale oil, consists of conden -
sable hydrocarbons (C
5+) and small quantities of 
decomposition water. The gaseous product is a 
mixture of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, 
hydrogen, nitrogen, hydrogen sulfide, methane, and other hydrocarbons (C
4−). The carbona -
ceous residue, a coke-like material, is obtained 
in a mixture with the inorganic minerals of the 
original oil shale ( Weiss, 2005 ).
1.2 Uses
Oil shales occur in many parts of the world. 
The areas where they are found range in size 
from small occurrences of little or no economic 
value to thousands of square miles. Oil shales also differ in geologic age, from Cambrian (570–
500 million years ago) to Tertiary (65–2 million 
years ago). Total world resources of extractable oil shale are conservatively estimated at 2.6 tril -
lion barrels ( AAPG, 2009 ).SHALE OILS
Shale oils were considered by previous IARC Working Groups in 1984 and 1987 ( IARC, 1985 , 
1987 ). Since that time, new data have become available, which have been incorporated into 
this Monograph , and taken into consideration in the present evaluation.IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
Early applications of shale oils included use 
as a source of paraffin waxes and burning oils for 
lamps, as well as for medicinal purposes. Later 
on, shale oils were used to prepare gasoline, diesel oils and lubricants from its light, intermediate 
and heavy distillates, respectively. The fuel oils, 
representing the major part of liquid products from the internal combustion (gas-generator 
type) retorts, have been used in the manufacture 
of gas-turbine fuel oil, automobile gasoline, and additives for high-sulfur petroleum fuel oils. 
(Aarna, 1978 ; Öpik & Kaganovich, 1981 ). In the 
People’s Republic of China, shale oil has been 
used to generate electric power and as a refinery 
feedstock ( Dickson, 1981 ). Products included 
gasoline, kerosene, diesel fuel and coke ( Qian, 
1982 ; IARC, 1985 ).
Oil-shale industries are operating in Europe 
(Estonia), South America (Brazil) and Asia 
(China). The largest operations are in Estonia, 
where approximately 12 million tonnes of oil 
shale is mined annually (underground and open-pit mining). About 85% of this material is burned 
as fuel in electric power-plants in north-eastern 
Estonia; the remainder is retorted for shale oil and used to manufacture fuels and petrochemi -
cals. In Brazil, oil shale is mined in open pits and is retorted for shale oil, liquefied petroleum gas, sulfur and fuel gas ( AAPG, 2006 ).
1.3 Human exposure
According to the US National Occupational 
Exposure Survey (1981–83), approximately 350 
workers (including approximately 150 women) 
were potentially exposed to shale oil ( NIOSH, 
1990 ).
Very few studies were identified that assessed 
occupational exposures to shale oil. Most studies of this industry assessed exposures to other 
contaminants: free crystalline silica in the form 
of quartz; asbestos ( Kangur, 2007 ), diesel exhaust 
(Scheepers et al., 2002 ; Muzyka et al., 2003, 2004 ; 
Knudsen et al ., 2005 ), trace elements (arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury, nickel), hydrogen sulphide, uranium and radon, carbon monoxide, 
phenol, polynuclear aromatic compounds, such 
as benzo( a)pyrene and 1-nitropyrene ( Kuljukka 
et al ., 1996 , 1998 ; Anderson et al ., 1997 ; Boffetta 
et al ., 1997 ; Kivistö et al ., 1997 ; Scheepers 
et al ., 2002 , 2003 ), aromatic compounds, such 
as benzene and toluene ( Anderson et al ., 1997 ; 
Kivistö et al., 1997 ; Marcon et al., 1999 ; Scheepers 
et al., 2002 ; Sørensen et al., 2004 ), sulfur dioxide, 
and dust in shale mines, retorts, tips and brick -
works (Louw et al., 1986 ).
2. Cancer in Humans
Most of the literature addressing the carcino -
genicity of shale oils dates back to the early part 
of the 20th century, with compelling evidence 
from case series of skin cancer, particularly of the scrotum, in the United Kingdom. These case 
series are substantial in scale, including 65 cases of scrotal cancer that occurred in the period 
1900–21 in the Scottish shale-oil industry ( Scott, 
1922a , b). Exposure of cotton-textile workers 
(mule spinners) exposed under non-hygienic conditions to lubricating oil that included shale 
oil during varying time periods, was strongly associated with cancer of the scrotum ( Southam, 
1928 ; Brockbank, 1941 ). Even in the absence 
of methodologically rigorous epidemiologic studies, this association has become accepted as 
causal.
As the oil-shale industry has risen and fallen 
over time in various parts of the world, a modest epidemiological literature has been developed. 
The size and prospects for the industry have fluc -
tuated dramatically over time in relation to the 
price of oil, resulting in a haphazard approach 
to epidemiology that addresses the health of workers in the industry. Furthermore, varying 
technologies for releasing the oil from the shale 
have different implications for exposures of 
198Shale oils
the workforce. A morbidity survey of several 
hundred workers in the USA employed at an 
oil-shale demonstration facility suggested an 
increased risk for abnormal sputum cytology and no excess of skin cancer ( Rom et al., 1985 ).
The most extensive epidemiological study 
of cancer among oil-shale workers addressed causes of death among 6359 Scottish workers 
employed in the period 1950–62 and followed 
for vital status through 1982 ( Miller et al., 1986 ). 
The focus was on the subset of 3161 men who 
worked in mining, retorting, or refining, with 
maximum potential exposure to shale oil. A total of 1868 of these men died, 802 before the start of 
mortality follow-up and 1066 during the follow-
up, i.e. between January 1968 to December 1982. Mortality of the workers from lung, stomach, 
colon, rectum, bladder, and kidney cancers 
was similar to or lower than that of an external population. Only skin cancer, with six observed 
deaths, was in excess, with an estimated rela -
tive risk of 4.9 (95%CI: 2.2–10.9). This elevation 
in skin-cancer mortality is consistent with the 
case series noted previously. A more detailed 
evaluation of the exposure conditions for 212 lung-cancer cases compared with 221 men with 
other diseases, mostly cardiovascular problems, 
revealed no associations with occupational expo -
sures. In contrast to the skin-cancer mortality 
excess, a survey of 1664 living workers from 
the same cohort revealed no increase in self-reported skin tumours ( Seaton et al ., 1986 ). No 
lung-cancer excess was reported among workers in the shale-oil industry employed at a facility in central Sweden between 1942 and 1966. 
Comparison of 51 lung-cancer deaths with 206 
referent deaths did not indicate any association of shale-oil exposure with lung cancer ( Seldén, 
1987 ).
Overall, based on the case series, with some 
corroborating epidemiological studies, there is evidence that exposure to shale oil is causally 
associated with skin cancer, particularly of the scrotum. Data pertaining to other cancer sites, 
including lung, remain inadequate to draw a 
conclusion on any association due to the limited 
research done thus far, the limited quality of the exposure data, and the poor precision of the esti -
mates in the completed studies.
3. Cancer in Experimental Animals
A large number and a wide variety of animal 
studies have been conducted to analyse shale-
derived oil and its precursors, or the by-products 
of shale-oil processing. The resulting picture is quite complex, as experimental results are 
affected by several factors, including: (1) the 
nature of the material under study (raw shale, spent shale, crude, hydro-treated or refined shale 
oil, retort process-water, or oil-shale ash); (2) the 
mineral composition of the original shale and the type of retort process; and (3) the fractionation 
procedure used to separate and/or characterize 
the active constituents of the complex mixture.
Table 3.1  includes some of the studies consid -
ered as the most representative of the carcino -
genicity of shale oils as well as studies published since the previous evaluation ( IARC, 1985 ).

dose-dependent increase in lung cancer (epider -
moid carcinomas) ( Dagle et al., 1990 ).
3.1.3  Inhalation
An aerosol generated from a Write Dust 
Feed packed with a raw-shale sample from 
Anvil Points, Colorado, and one spent-shale 
sample from a direct-heated retort induced lung adenomas and carcinomas in rats during 24 
months of exposure, but not in hamsters during 
16 months of exposure ( Holland et al., 1983 ).
3.2 Crude shale oils from low-
temperature retorting
3.2.1  Skin application
Crude shale oils from a variety of loca -
tions around the world and processed by heat 
transfer or retort combustion at temperatures 
below 1000 °C consistently induced squamous cell papillomas and carcinomas when repeatedly 
applied to the skin of mice ( Hueper, 1953 ; IARC, 
1985 ). Shale-derived crude oils and a hydro-
treated product induced papillomas and carci -
nomas in mouse skin during nearly two years of 
treatment ( Wilson & Holland, 1988 ).
The inner surface of rabbit ears painted with 
the heavy fraction of the generator (semi-coking) oil obtained from the Estonian oil-shale in gas generators at Kohtla-Järve induced squamous cell 
carcinomas in 8% of the rabbits. In one surviving 
rabbit, metastases of the carcinomas were found in the regional lymph nodes, the liver, and the 
lungs ( Vahter, 1959 ; IARC, 1985 )
3.2.2  Intratracheal administration
Intratracheal administration of a crude shale 
oil at three dose levels significantly increased the incidence of lung tumours in mice across all dose 
groups ( Smith & Witschi, 1983 ; IARC, 1985 ).3.3 Crude shale oils from high-
temperature retorting
3.3.1  Skin application
Crude shale oils processed in chamber ovens 
above 900 °C induced squamous cell papillomas 
and carcinomas when applied to the skin of mice 
(Larionov, 1947 ; Bogovski, 1958 , 1961 ; Tur u, 
1961 ; Bogovski & Vinkmann, 1979 ; IARC, 1985 ). 
Chamber-oven oil applied to the inner surface of rabbit ears resulted in multiple squamous-cell papillomas and keratoacanthomas and 
cornifying and non-cornifying squamous-cell 
carcinomas in 22% of the rabbits. In one rabbit, metastases in the lung and liver were found 
(Vahter, 1959 ; IARC, 1985 ).
3.4 Shale-oil fractions
Assessment of fractionations of shale oil 
were undertaken to determine the extent to which exposure to fractions containing known 
carcinogens such as benzo[ a]pyrene correlates 
with carcinogenic activity.
3.4.1  Skin application
Chromatographic fractions of shale oil 
prepared by adsorption on aluminium oxide and 
elution with various solvents induced benign and 
malignant skin tumours in mice ( Berenblum & 
Schoental, 1943 ; IARC, 1985 ). Chromatographic 
fractions of high-temperature (800–1000 °C, chamber-oven) shale oil were collected on silica-gel column and further fractionated into five 
fractions on aluminium oxide eluted with various 
solvents. Some of the fractions induced carci -
nomas and sarcomas with metastases in mice, 
and papillomas but not carcinomas in rabbits 
(Bogovski, 1961 , 1962 ; IARC, 1985 ).
202Shale oils
3.4.2  Subcutaneous and/or intramuscular 
administration
Intramuscular injection of various thermo-
distillation products and multiple chromato-
graphy fractions of crude shale oil into the thigh 
of mice induced sarcomas at the site of injec -
tion ( Hueper & Cahnmann, 1958 ; IARC, 1985 ). 
Chromatographic fractions of chamber-oven tar injected intramuscularly into the thigh of mice induced sarcomas at the injection site and lung 
tumours in some of the mice, which were also 
reported in historical controls ( Bogovski, 1961 , 
1962 ; IARC, 1985 ).
3.5 Shale-oil distillates, blends and 
other commercial products
3.5.1  Skin application
Application to the skin of mice of individual 
distillates and blends of distillates from shale oil 
– including products such as ‘green’ oil, ‘blue’ oil, 
unfinished gas oil, machine lubricating oil, fuel oil, wood-impregnating oil, tar, bitumen, coke, 
and lacquer – induced papillomas, spindle-cell 
sarcoma, and squamous-cell carcinomas ( Twort 
& Ing, 1928 ; Hueper, 1953 ; IARC, 1985 ). Heavy 
fractions of shale oils appeared to be more carci -
nogenic than light fractions. The latter induced only benign tumours while heavy fractions 
induced benign and malignant tumours with a 
shorter latency period ( IARC, 1985 ).
Crude oil, naptha, and jet fuels derived form 
shale induced squamous-cell carcinomas and fibrosarcomas when applied to the skin of mice, whereas hydro-treated and diesel-distilled shale 
oil did not produce tumours ( Clark et al ., 1988 ). 
Crude shale oil and industrial residue derived 
from a blend of shale oils induced two and three 
skin carcinomas (in 60 and 56 animals), respec -
tively. No tumours were observed in controls 
(Bogovski et al., 1990 ).Tolichthtol, a product obtained from the 
acid residue of rectification of shale-oil aromatic 
fractions – containing up to 22% (w/w) sulfur 
compounds – did not induce tumours during 24 months after application to the skin ( Vinkmann 
& Mirme, 1975 )
3.5.2  Intratracheal administration
Shale-oil coke (a raw-shale distillation 
residue) did not produce tumours in Syrian 
golden hamsters after intra-tracheal instillation 
(Rowland et al., 1980 ).
3.6 Synthesis
Inhalation of either raw oil shale or spent oil 
shale produced lung tumours in rats. Application 
of an extract of spent oil shale produced skin 
tumours in mice. Skin application of crude oils from both low- and high-temperature retorting 
induced skin tumours in mice and rabbits; the 
oils obtained from high-temperature retorting had higher carcinogenic activity. A low-tempera-
ture crude oil produced lung tumours in mice 
after intra-tracheal instillation. Various fractions of shale oils were carcinogenic when applied to 
the skin of mice and rabbits. Shale-oil distil -
lates, residues, blends and commercial products 
of the oil-shale industry were tested in mice by 
dermal application, and produced skin tumours. 
Distillation fractions from less highly refined shale oils were more carcinogenic than the more 
highly refined products.
4. Other Relevant Data
4.1 Humans
Shale oil-plant workers in Estonia were exam -
ined for chromosomal damage and aneuploidy in peripheral blood cells by means of tandem-
labelling fluorescence in situ hybridization. One 
203IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
group of 12 workers was engaged in benzene 
production from shale oils and another group, 
of five workers, engaged in coke operations. The 
control group of eight was from a nearby village. No significant difference in the extent of DNA 
breakage was detected in nucleated cells in blood 
smears of exposed vs control subjects. In contrast, 
modest but significantly increased frequencies 
of breakage affecting both chromosomes 1 and 
9 were observed in the cultured lymphocytes of the benzene-exposed workers compared with the 
unexposed controls ( Marcon et al ., 1999 ). [The 
Working Group noted that workers were likely 
to be also exposed to other carcinogens such as 
benzene and coke-oven emissions.]
Peripheral blood lymphocytes from 49 
smoking and non-smoking coke-oven workers from a shale-oil plant in Estonia and 10 controls 
from a nearby village were examined for the presence of aromatic DNA adducts by use 
of the [
32P]-postlabelling techniques. Mean 
DNA-adduct levels in the exposed group did not differ from those in the controls; however, 
smokers had significantly higher levels of DNA adducts compared with non-smokers ( Kuljukka 
et al., 1998 ).
4.2 Experimental systems
Low-temperature shale-derived crude oils 
and oil-shale retort waters showed mutagenic 
activity in bacteria, fungi, and mammalian cells 
in culture. These two agents also induced chro -
mosomal effects in mammalian cells in vitro  and 
in vivo  (IARC, 1985 , 1987 ). Data on the genotoxic 
activities of raw and spent shale and oil-shale ash, and oil-shale retort-process waters were incon -
clusive at the time.
Dichloromethane extracts of oil-shale ash 
were evaluated in a matagenicity assay with an 
arabinose-resistant Salmonella typhimurium  
strain. These extracts were highly mutagenic in 
the absence of an exogenous metabolic activa -
tion system. Similar results were obtained with oil-shale ash extracts prepared with ethyl acetate/methanol as the extraction solvent ( Whong et al., 
1983 ).
Shale oil and acid-base-neutral solvent frac -
tions were evaluated with the morphological cell-
transformation assay in Syrian hamster embryo 
cells in the presence of an exogenous source of metabolic activation. The unfractionated crude 
oil, the basic fraction, and the PAH fraction 
produced a positive response in the assay ( Frazier 
& Andrews, 1983 ).
Genotoxicity assays were conducted on 
industrial Kitiver shale oil and its two fractions, the low-temperature fraction (230–350 °C) and 
the rectification residue obtained in the labora -
tory, as well as the industrial rectification residue. 
Human lymphocytes exposed to the shale oil 
and each of the rectification samples had signifi -
cantly increased frequencies of sister chromatid 
exchange compared with the controls, irrespec -
tive of the presence or absence of exogenous metabolic activation. Shale oil and the industrial rectification samples also significantly increased 
the frequency of chromosomal abnormalities 
compared with the controls, with and without metabolic activation ( Bogovski et al., 1990 ).
4.3 Synthesis
Shale oils are genotoxic in experimental 
systems. There are only few data to determine an 
underlying mechanism for the carcinogenicity of 
shale oils.
5. Evaluation
There is sufficient evidence  in humans for 
the carcinogenicity of shale oils. Shale oils cause 
cancer of the skin (observed in the scrotum).
There is sufficient evidence  in experimental 
animals for the carcinogenicity of shale oils. 
204Shale oils
Shale oils are genotoxic in experimental 
systems. There is weak evidence to determine 
a mechanism of action underlying the carcino -
genic effects of shale oils, based on two studies 
with lymphocytes in exposed workers.
Shale oils are carcinogenic to humans 
(Group 1) .

2072091. Exposure Data
For hundreds of years, chimneys have been 
swept with long steel brushes inserted manu -
ally into the chimney from the top and from the 
bottom. Chimney sweeps are exposed to soot, with concurrent exposure to sulfur dioxide and 
arsenic ( Bagchi & Zimmerman, 1980 ).
Soot is black particulate matter that is formed 
as a by-product of combustion or pyrolysis of organic (carbon-containing) materials, such as 
coal, wood, fuel oil, waste oil, paper, plastics and household refuse. The chemical composition 
and properties of soots are highly variable and 
depend on the type of starting material and the conditions of combustion. Soots vary consid -
erably with respect to their relative content of carbon, their particle type, size and shape, and the types of organic and inorganic compounds 
adsorbed onto the particles. In general, soots 
have a total carbon content of up to 60%, a high content of inorganic material, and a soluble 
organic fraction. The latter is extractable with 
organic solvents and consists largely of PAHs and their derivatives. Inorganic constituents may 
include oxides, salts, metals, sulfur and nitrogen compounds, water, and other adsorbed liquids 
and gases ( IARC, 1985 ; Watson & Valberg, 2001 ).
Table 1.1  summarizes several recent studies 
that investigated exposure of chimney sweeps to PAHs. Knecht et al. (1989)  assessed exposures in 
the breathing zone of chimney sweeps during so-called ‘dirty’ or ‘black work’ on 11 working days. Samples were taken per ‘job category’, 
based on the type of fuel fired: oil fuel, oil/solid 
or solid fuels. Twenty PAHs were quantified in a total of 115 samples. Higher concentrations were 
seen in soots that originated from burning of 
solid fuels. A bio-monitoring study carried out in Germany ( n = 93) and Poland ( n = 7) in 1995 
reported 1-hydroxypyrene concentrations in the urine ranging from below the detection limit (0.1 μg/L) up to 12.8 μg/L ( Letzel et al ., 1999 ). 
Urinary concentrations in the samples from Poland were on average five times higher, most probably due to the fact that coal and wood are 
used more often as fuels in Poland. The concentra -
tions in urine samples from workers in Germany 
were relatively low. The use of personal protective 
devices among this group of 100 chimney sweeps 
was not mentioned. In an Italian study, Pavanello et al . (2000)  analysed the urine of 27 chimney SOOT, AS f OUND IN OCCUPATIONAL

Soot was considered by previous IARC Working Groups in 1972, 1984, and 1987 ( IARC, 1973 , 
1985 , 1987 ). Chimney sweeping and other exposures to soot were evaluated in 2005 ( IARC,

2. Cancer in Humans
In IARC Monograph  Volume 92 ( IARC, 2010 ), 
epidemiological studies of cancer in humans 
were considered to provide sufficient evidence  for 
the carcinogenicity of occupational exposure as a 
chimney sweep. The evidence partly came from 
a large series of reports on cases of scrotal skin 
cancer in this occupational group. Soot was first noted as a cause of scrotal cancer in humans by 
Pott (1775) . Many case reports of scrotal and other 
skin cancers among chimney sweeps appeared 
subsequently in several different countries (e.g. 
Earle, 1808 ; Butlin, 1892; Henry & Irvine, 1936 ; 
Henry, 1937 , 1946 , 1947 ). A total of 1487 cases 
of scrotal cancer were reported to the Registrar General for England and Wales from 1911–1935 
(Henry, 1937 ). Of these, 6.9% had occurred in 
chimney sweeps; the estimated proportion of 
chimney sweeps in England and Wales in 1921 
and 1931 was about 0.06% of all adult males, indicating a large excess of scrotal cancer among 
workers in this profession.
Evanoff et al . (1993)  conducted large cohort 
study of Swedish chimney sweeps and found an excess of cancer of the lung, bladder, oesophagus 
and haematolymphatic organs; a study from Finland corroborated these findings ( Pukkala, 
1995 ). These studies did not include individual 
adjustments for tobacco smoking, but in the Swedish study an adjustment was made for smoking at the group level, whereas in the Finnish 
study adjustment was for social class. Both analyses indicated that confounding from tobacco 
smoking did not explain the findings regarding 
lung cancer. In two Danish cohort studies an 
excess of total cancer was found, but the studies were too small to evaluate individual cancer sites 
(Hansen et al., 1982 ; Hansen, 1983 ; see Table 2.1, 
available at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/
Monographs/vol100F/100F-16-Table2.1.pdf ).
Pukkala et al . (2009)  reported on a record-
linkage study from the Nordic countries encom -
passing 15 million people aged 30–64 identified 
from the censuses in 1960, 1970, 1980/81, and 
1990, and followed for cancer in the national cancer registries until 2005. A total of 5498 
male chimney sweeps from Denmark, Finland, 
Norway and Sweden were identified in the cohort. Statistically significant excesses of cancers of 
the lung, oesophagus, pharynx, bladder, and 
colon were found. There was no excess of non-melanoma skin cancer. There was not a large 
heterogeneity in risk between countries, and no 
adjustment for smoking was made.
The above-mentioned study by Pukkala et 
al. (2009)  – which included information from 
the earlier study ( Pukkala, 1995 ) – adds to the 
previous evidence of an excess of cancer of the 
lung, bladder and oesophagus among chimney 
sweeps. Despite the classical risk for scrotal cancer in chimney sweeps, studies of this occu -
pational group under modern working condi -
tions show no such excesses.
Overall, considering a consistently observed 
increased lung-cancer risk in several studies, and on the basis of a large cohort study that demonstrated an internal dose–response after 
group-level adjustment for smoking, there is 
evidence from human epidemiological studies that lung cancer is causally associated with occu -
pational exposure during work as a chimney 
sweep. No internal dose–response was observed 
for bladder cancer in the large Swedish study, and the evidence for an excess bladder cancer 
among chimney sweeps must be considered as 
211IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
limited. The incidence of oesophageal cancer 
is highly correlated with smoking and alcohol 
consumption, and in the absence of control for 
these two factors, the evidence of an association with occupational exposure as a chimney sweep 
is inadequate. From historical case reports there 
is sufficient evidence of an increased risk for (scrotal) skin cancer among chimney sweeps.
3. Cancer in Experimental Animals
Coal soot was tested in two experiments in 
mice by whole-body exposure, but these studies 
were inadequate for evaluation. Coal-soot 
extracts applied to the skin of mice produced skin tumours in two studies ( IARC, 1985 ).
In limited studies, subcutaneous implants of 
wood soot in female rats produced a few local sarcomas. Similar implants in the scrotal sac 
of rats did not produce tumours. One study of 
wood-soot extract applied to the skin of mice was uninformative ( IARC, 1985 ).
One study of an extract of fuel-oil soot applied 
to the skin of mice was uninformative. Extracts of soot from the combustion of oil shale produced 
skin tumours in mice after dermal application 
and lung tumours in rats after intratracheal instillation ( IARC, 1985 ).
Extracts of soot from the combustion of 
heating oil produced from shale oil produced skin tumours in mice in two skin-application 
experiments ( IARC, 1985 ).4. Other Relevant Data
4.1 Mechanistic evidence relevant 
to the carcinogenic hazards from occupational exposure as a 
chimney sweep
4.1.1  Experimental systems
Experimental studies on soots have been 
evaluated in IARC Monograph  Volume 35 and 
in Supplement 7 ( IARC, 1985 , 1987 ). In one 
study, extracts of soot samples from domestic 
sources were mutagenic in Salmonella typhi-
murium , both in the presence and absence of 
an exogenous metabolic system. Extracts of an 
experimentally-derived soot were mutagenic in 
forward-mutation assays in S. typhimurium  and 
in cultured human lymphoblasts in the presence of metabolic activation ( IARC, 1985 ). Extracts 
of particulate emissions from wood-combustion 
induced sister chromatid exchange in Chinese 
hamster ovary cells, transformation of Syrian 
hamster embryo cells, and mutation in S. typhi-
murium.  An experimentally prepared, intact 
particulate soot and an extract of this material were both mutagenic in a human lymphoblastoid cell line ( IARC, 1987 ).
Chemical analyses of chimney-soot extracts 
have identified several polycyclic aromatic hydro -
carbons that are genotoxic and carcinogenic 
in experimental studies. These include benz[ a]
anthracene, benzo[ c]phenanthrene, benzo[ a]
pyrene, dibenz[ a,h]anthracene, chrysene, and 
indeno[1,2,3- cd]pyrene ( IARC, 1983 , 1985 , 
2010 ). These polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 
may contribute to the genotoxic and tumorigenic 
activities of soots.
4.1.2  Humans
The frequency of micronuclei in peripheral 
B- or T-lymphocytes was studied in 71 Swedish 
chimney sweeps. Genetic polymorphisms in 
enzymes involved in metabolic activation were 
212Chimney soot
investigated to explain some of the variation 
in micronucleus formation. The sweeps did not 
have higher frequencies of micronuclei in either 
cell type when the results were adjusted for age and smoking, and there was no association 
between years of work and micronucleus forma -
tion ( Carstensen et al., 1993 ).
The same group of workers was studied for 
the presence of aromatic DNA adducts and 
micronuclei, and also genotyped for CYP1A1  and 
GST1 . While no specific DNA adducts were iden -
tified, the sweeps had higher total DNA-adduct levels in white blood cells, but the increase was not statistically significant. There were no 
systematic differences in DNA-adduct patterns 
between the sweeps and the controls. DNA adducts in sweeps were moderately but statisti -
cally significantly correlated with micronuclei in both T- and B-lymphocytes. The correlation between adduct-levels and micronuclei was most 
marked in T-lymphocytes of individuals lacking 
the GST1  gene (Ichiba et al., 1994 ).
Groups of 45 Swedish chimney sweeps and 
49 controls were investigated for micronucleus formation in blood lymphocytes stimulated by phytohaemagglutinin or pokeweed mitogen, 
and by analysis of lymphocyte subgroups and 
neutrophilic leukocytes. There were higher frequencies of micronuclei among sweeps than 
in controls, with both methods of stimula -
tion. The effect on micronucleus formation in 
lymphocytes was more significant in cells stimu -
lated with pokeweed mitogen, suggesting that the T4 lymphocytes were preferentially damaged by the occupational exposure ( Holmén et al., 1994 ).
Analysis of anti-benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-diol-
9,10-oxide-DNA adducts in a group of 19 chimney sweeps showed that four of them (21%) 
had adduct levels exceeding the 95 percentile 
control-subject value ( Pavanello et al ., 1999a ). 
These higher levels were associated with the lack 
of GSTM1 activity: three of the chimney sweeps 
had the GSTM1  *0/*0 genotype ( Pavanello et al., 
1999b ).4.2 Synthesis
Extracts of soots contain carcinogenic poly -
cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and are genotoxic. 
Based on a small number of genotoxicity studies 
in exposed humans, there is moderate evidence of a genotoxic mode of action for the carcino -
genic hazards associated with occupational exposures as a chimney sweep. The detection of anti-benzo[ a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide-
DNA adducts in the peripheral blood lympho -
cytes of chimney sweeps suggests involvement of benzo[ a]pyrene in the genotoxic effect of this 
exposure in humans.
5. Evaluation
There is sufficient evidence  in humans for the 
carcinogenicity of soot as found in occupational 
exposure of chimney sweeps. Soot, as found in 
occupational exposure of chimney sweeps, causes 
cancer of the skin (observed in the scrotum), and 
of the lung.
Also, a positive association has been observed 
between exposure to soot as found in occupa -
tional exposure of chimney sweeps and cancer of the bladder.
There is inadequate  evidence in experimental 
animals for the carcinogenicity of soot.
There is sufficient  evidence  in experimental 
animals for the carcinogenicity of soot extracts.
Extracts of soots contain carcinogenic poly -
cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and are genotoxic. 
Based on a small number of genotoxicity studies 
in humans there is moderate evidence for a geno -
toxic mechanism for occupational exposures as a 
chimney sweep.
Soot as found in occupational exposure 
of chimney sweeps is carcinogenic to humans 
(Group 1) .

2142151. Exposure Data
The aluminium-production industry as 
referred to in this Monograph  involves processes 
such as the electrolytic reduction of alumina to 
aluminium, and the casting of aluminium into ingots. The mining of bauxite, production of 
alumina from bauxite, alloying and fabrication 
of sheet metal, wire, foil and other such products are not considered.
1.1 Natural occurrence
Aluminium, the third most abundant element 
in the earth’s crust, occurs in nature in combina -
tion with silicon and oxygen (i.e. as aluminium silicate). When subject to tropical weathering, aluminium silicate may react to form aluminium 
hydroxide. Rock containing high concentra -
tions of aluminium hydroxide is called bauxite. 
This rock is the usual starting material for the 
production of aluminium. Metallurgical-grade 
alumina (Al
2O3) extracted from bauxite by the 
Bayer process is generally referred to as the ore 
(Sanders, 2002 ).1.2 Manufacturing processes
The electrolytic process by which aluminium 
is produced was described in IARC Monograph  
Volume 34 ( IARC, 1984 ). The process is 
briefly summarized here. Since 1886, nearly 
all aluminium has been produced by electro-
lysis of alumina dissolved in a molten cryolite 
(Na3AlF6)-based bath (also known as the Hall–
Héroult process). Molten aluminium is deposited 
on the carbon cathode, which also serves as the 
melt container, and oxygen is simultaneously deposited on and consumes the carbon–carbon 
anode(s) of the electrolytic cell ( Sanders, 2002 ).
A modern alumina-smelting cell consists 
of a rectangular steel shell lined with refrac -
tory insulation surrounding an inner lining of 
baked carbon. Electric current enters the cell through the anode (either pre-baked or continu -
ously self-baking Søderberg anode) and leaves through steel (collector) bars connected to the carbon cathode at the bottom. Pre-baked anodes 
are produced by moulding petroleum coke and 
coal-tar pitch binder into blocks which are baked at 1000–1200 °C. Søderberg anodes are formed 
continuously from a paste of petroleum coke 
and coal-tar pitch. The paste is typically added OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURES DURING 
ALUMINIUM PRODUCTION
Aluminium production was considered by previous IARC Working Groups in 1983, 1987 , and 
2005 (IARC, 1984 , 1987 , 2010 ). Since 2005 new data have become available, which have been 
incorporated in this Monograph , and taken into consideration in the present evaluation.IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F

1.3 Human exposure
Workers in aluminium production are 
primarily exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydro -
carbons (PAHs). Occupational exposures in this industry and the related carbon electrode-manu -
facturing industry have been monitored most 
intensively with respect to PAHs. Biomonitoring 
studies have focused primarily on exposures in the aluminium industry itself ( IARC, 1984 , 
2010 ; Table 1.1 ) and in anode-manufacturing 
for the aluminium industry ( IARC, 1984 , 2010 ; 
Table  1.2 ). Other potential exposures in these 
occupational settings include: sulfur dioxide and fluorides; aluminium fluoride; fibrous sodium aluminium tetrafluoride particles; fluorspar; 
alumina; carbon monoxide; carbon dioxide; 
various trace metals, such as vanadium, chro -
mium and nickel; asbestos; extreme heat; and 
high static magnetic fields ( Benke et al ., 1998 ; 
Dufresne et al., 1996 ).
Exposures to PAHs, sulfur dioxide and fluo -
rides have decreased over time ( Benke et al ., 
1998 ). At two plants that operated the vertical 
stud Søderberg pot-rooms in Norway, exposures have decreased fourfold on average between the 
late 1950s and the late 1980s ( Romundstad et al., 
1999 ). The decrease in exposure can be attrib -
uted to the implementation of improved control technology, increased use of effective devices for personal protection, and the increasing 
predominance of pre-bake pot-rooms ( Benke 
et al ., 1998 ), although this may only apply to 
the anode pre-baking plants. Concentrations of 1-hydroxypyrene in urine of workers in anode-
manufacturing for the aluminium industry did not decrease considerably between the mid-1980s and mid-1990s ( Table  1.2 ). In a review of 15 
studies, it was concluded that the use of biological 
monitoring has not led to a reduction in expo -
sure ( Hopf et al., 2009) . The exposure models by 
Friesen et al . (2006)  cover 25 years of extensive 
monitoring in a Canadian Söderborg smelter, 
and show a rapid decline in inhalation exposures before the early/mid-1980s, but a considerable 
levelling off more recently.
Dermal exposure to PAHs and the ensuing 
uptake through the skin may contribute to the internal exposure of workers to PAHs. Vanrooij 
et al . (1992)  showed that dermal exposure does 
not necessarily correlate with exposure by inha -
lation of workers in the pot-rooms and the anode pre-bake plants. Levels of benzo[ a]pyrene on the 
wrists of workers in the bake-oven area were twice 
as high as those of workers from the paste plant. 
The exposure of bake-oven workers to benzo[ a]
pyrene by inhalation, however, appeared to be 
four times lower than that of workers in the paste 
plant. Exposure to pyrene by both inhalation and dermal contact was higher in the paste plant. No 
information was available for temporal trends in 
dermal exposure in these workplaces.
2. Cancer in Humans
The cancer hazards associated with expo -
sures in aluminium production were evaluated 
in IARC Monograph  Volume 92 ( IARC, 2010 ). 
There was sufficient evidence  from epidemio -
logical studies of a carcinogenic effect of occu -
pational exposure in aluminium production, 
based on a relatively large number of studies that showed a consistent excess of cancer of the 
bladder and a somewhat less consistent excess 
of lung cancer. The following review is based on studies of aluminium-smelter workers included 
in IARC Monograph  Volume 92 ( IARC, 2010 ) 
and those published later.

2.1 Cancer of the urinary bladder
A large cohort study from Québec, Canada 
(Gibbs et al., 2007 ) showed an excess of bladder-
cancer mortality with a statistically signifi -
cant linear trend with cumulative exposure to 
benzo[ a]pyrene B[ a]P (see Table 2.1, available at 
http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100F/100F-17-Table2.1.pdf ). The excess risk 
was evident only in workers who had been first 
employed before 1950, and smaller risks were 
noted in those first employed later ( Gibbs & 
Sevigny, 2007a , b). An increased risk for bladder 
cancer and a significant exposure-response trend was found in a cohort study from British Columbia, Canada ( Spinelli et al ., 2006 ; Friesen 
et al ., 2007 ). Both Canadian studies derived 
smoking-adjusted risk estimates. A significant excess for bladder cancer with a positive expo -
sure-response trend was also found in a study of a Norwegian aluminium smelter ( Romundstad 
et al ., 2000 ). Supporting evidence of a bladder-
cancer excess comes from cohort studies from France ( Mur et al., 1987 ; Moulin et al., 2000 ) and 
the United States of America (USA) ( Rockette & 
Arena, 1983 ). A recently reported cohort study 
from Australia showed no excess of bladder cancer, although the follow-up was relatively 
short ( Friesen et al ., 2009 ; Sim et al ., 2009 ). No 
bladder-cancer excess was found in a Swedish 
study ( Björ et al., 2008 ). 
2.2 Cancer of the lung
An excess of lung cancer in aluminium-
production workers has been reported although 
the data were less consistent than for bladder 
cancer. The large Quebec cohort showed a smoking-adjusted excess of lung cancer with 
an exposure-response trend ( Gibbs et al ., 2007 ; 
Gibbs & Sevigny, 2007b ; Armstrong & Gibbs, 
2009 ). An excess of lung cancer, but no clear 
trend, was noted in the Swedish cohort ( Björ 
et al ., 2008 ). The cohort from British Columbia Canada showed no overall excess of lung cancer, 
but a trend with increasing cumulative exposure 
to B[ a]P (Spinelli et al., 2006 ; Friesen et al., 2007 ). 
The Australian cohort showed no excess but a 
positive trend with exposure to dust, but not to 
B[a]P (Friesen et al ., 2009 ; Sim et al ., 2009 ). No 
excess of lung cancer was evident in the studies 
from France ( Mur et al ., 1987 ; Moulin et al ., 
2000 ), Norway ( Romundstad et al ., 2000 ) or the 
USA ( Rockette & Arena, 1983 ). 
2.3 Synthesis
Overall, the cohort studies strongly support an 
association between work in aluminium smelters 
and bladder-cancer risk. Confounding or chance 
is not likely to explain the findings. There is an increased risk for cancer of the bladder from 
occupational exposure in aluminium smelters.
An increased risk for lung cancer has been 
found in several but not all epidemiological studies in the aluminium-production industry. 
Some studies also show a dose–response trend in terms of B[ a]P–years. Confounding from 
smoking or chance is not likely to explain the findings. Based on these observations, there is evidence that risk for cancer of the lung is caus -
ally associated with work in aluminium smelters.
The exposure circumstances, especially levels 
of PAH in aluminium smelters, vary between 
industrial departments and also depend on the 
process used. However, data are not sufficient to disentangle the cancer risks associated with 
these different exposure situations.
3. Cancer in Experimental Animals
Two samples of airborne particulate poly -
nuclear organic matter were collected from two sites in an aluminium-production plant. 
Each sample was tested by topical application of 50 mg in toluene (1:1) twice weekly to the skin of 
twenty C3H mice. Samples containing 0.11% and 
219IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
0.62% B[ a]P induced 15/18 and 15/17 malignant 
skin tumours, respectively. The average time of 
appearance of the first tumours was 24 and 18 
weeks, respectively. No tumours were observed in 37 toluene-treated controls ( Bingham et al ., 
1979 ; IARC, 1984 ) [Duration of the study and sex 
of the animals unspecified; the control animals were from a different study of the same labora -
tory, with the same protocol.]
In addition, several individual polynuclear 
aromatic compounds for which there is sufficient 
evidence  of carcinogenicity in experimental 
animals have been measured at high levels in air samples taken from certain areas in aluminium-
production plants ( IARC, 1984 , 2010 ).
4. Other Relevant Data
4.1 Mechanistic evidence relevant 
to the carcinogenic hazard from 
occupational exposures during 
aluminium production
4.1.1   Experimental systems
Air-emission samples from an aluminium-
smelting facility were mutagenic in Salmonella 
typhimurium  strains TA98 and TA100. All 
samples were mutagenic in both strains in the 
presence of an exogenous metabolic activation 
system and some samples were mutagenic in 
strain TA98 in the absence of metabolic activa -
tion ( Alfheim & Wikstrom, 1984 ). Air-particle 
samples collected on filters in the anode-paste plant and pot-room in a Søderberg aluminium-production facility were also mutagenic in strains 
TA100 and TA98, mainly after metabolic activa -
tion; some positive results were also obtained in 
TA98 without S9-mix ( Krøkje et al., 1985 ).
PAHs have been detected and their concen -
trations measured in the atmosphere of different locations in an aluminium-production plant 
(IARC, 1984 ). These PAHs may contribute, in part, to the genotoxic and tumorigenic activities 
of particulates collected from such plants.
Naphthalene, which is genotoxic and carci -
nogenic in experimental studies, has also been detected in the indoor atmosphere of an 
aluminium-production plant ( IARC, 2002 ; 
Brusick et al., 2008 ).
4.1.2  Humans
No increase in the frequency of sister chro -
matid exchange or chromosomal aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes was observed in 
workers in the aluminium industry. No effects on sperm morphology, sperm counts, or double 
Y-bodies were noted in aluminium-production 
workers compared with matched controls. There were mixed reports on the mutagenic activity in 
the urine of workers in the aluminium industry 
(IARC, 1987 ).
Human studies on the genotoxic effects of 
exposures during aluminium production have been reviewed in IARC Monograph  Volume 
92 ( IARC, 2010 ). In several studies, aromatic 
DNA adducts were analysed in peripheral blood lymphocytes of aluminium-production workers, with mixed results. In 172 Hungarian aluminium-
plant workers, higher aromatic DNA-adduct 
levels were measured compared with those in controls ( Schoket et al ., 1999 ). Earlier studies 
from Hungary had observed aromatic DNA adducts in the lymphocytes of aluminium-plant workers at different locations, at different 
times of the year, and in different job categories 
(Schoket et al ., 1993a , b, 1995 ). A significant 
linear correlation was observed between the total 
amount of aromatic DNA adducts in lympho -
cytes and the concentration of 1-hydroxypyrene 
in urine of Hungarian pot-room workers with 
the GSTM1 -null genotype ( Schoket et al ., 2001 ). 
Other populations of aluminium-plant workers 
have also been studied, with generally positive 
results with respect to detection of aromatic 
DNA adducts ( Kriek et al ., 1993 ; Ovrebø et al ., 
220Aluminium production
1995 ; van S chooten et al ., 1995 ). Ninety-eight 
Swedish pot-room workers were examined for 
the presence of aromatic DNA adducts and gene 
polymorphisms. No significant differences were observed in the levels of total or individual DNA 
adducts between pot-room workers and controls 
(Tuominen et al ., 2002 ). Only one sample from 
the lymphocytes of 30 aluminium-plant workers 
was found to contain B[ a]P-7,8-diol-9,10-
oxide-DNA adducts ( Vahakangas et al., 1985 ). In 
a group of 36 aluminium anode-plant workers, the percentage of subjects with DNA-adduct 
levels exceeding the 95 percentile control-subject value was small and not significant ( Pavanello 
et al ., 1999 ). Antibodies against B[ a]P-7,8-diol-
9,10-oxide-DNA were detected in the serum of 13.3% of 105 aluminium-plant workers ( Galati 
et al., 2001 ).
The lymphocytes of 42 Italian aluminium-
plant workers were examined for micronucleus 
formation and DNA-damage induction (single-
cell gel electrophoresis assay). While none of the workers showed significant changes in the 
frequency of micronuclei, significant increases 
in DNA damage were noted, but only when the lymphocytes were cultured in the presence of 
cytosine arabinoside, a nucleoside analogue that 
blocks DNA synthesis ( Crebelli et al., 2002 ).
Ninety-eight Swedish pot-room workers and 
55 controls were examined for the presence of polymorphisms in genes encoding biotrans -
formation enzymes, of gene mutations, DNA 
strand-breaks, and micronuclei in mononuclear 
blood cells, and of 8-oxodeoxyguanosine in urine. No correlations were found between any 
of the genotoxicity biomarkers and any of the 
exposure measures, e.g. length of employment in the pot-room, 1-hydroxypyrene in urine, or 
PAH-DNA adducts in peripheral lymphocytes, 
even when different genotypes for biotransfor -
mation enzymes were considered ( Carstensen 
et al., 1999b ).4.2 Synthesis
Air-emission samples from aluminium 
smelters were mutagenic in bacteria. There were 
mixed reports on the mutagenicity of urine from 
exposed workers. DNA-adduct studies of blood samples from aluminium-smelter workers also 
gave mixed results.
Based on both experimental and human 
studies, there is weak-to-moderate evidence for a genotoxic mechanism underlying the effects 
of occupational exposures during aluminium production.
5. Evaluation
There is sufficient evidence  in humans for 
the carcinogenicity of occupational exposures 
during aluminium production. Occupational 
exposures during aluminium production cause cancer of bladder, and of the lung.
There is sufficient evidence  in experimental 
animals for the carcinogenicity of airborne particulate polynuclear organic matter from 
aluminium-production plants.
Air-emission samples from aluminium 
smelters were mutagenic in bacteria. There were mixed reports on the mutagenicity of urine from 
exposed workers. DNA-adduct studies of blood samples from aluminium-smelter workers also 
gave mixed results.
Based on both experimental and human 
studies, there is weak-to-moderate evidence for a genotoxic mechanism underlying the effects 
of occupational exposures during aluminium production.
Occupational exposures during aluminium 
production are carcinogenic to humans (Group 1) .

Description : Aflatoxins form colourless to 
pale-yellow crystals. Intensely fluorescent in 
ultraviolet light, emitting blue (aflatoxins B1 and B2) or green (aflatoxin G1) and green-blue (afla -
toxin G2) fluorescence, from which the desig -
nations B and G were derived, or blue-violet fluorescence (aflatoxin M1).
Solubility : Very slightly soluble in water 
(10–30 μg/mL); insoluble in non-polar solvents; freely soluble in moderately polar organic solvents 
(e.g. chloroform and methanol) and especially in 
dimethyl sulfoxide ( IARC, 2002 ).
1.2 Sources and uses
Aflatoxins are produced primarily by the 
common fungus Aspergillus flavus  and the 
closely related species A. parasiticus . These are 
well defined species: A. flavus  produces only B 
aflatoxins and sometimes the mycotoxin cyclopi -
azonic acid (CPA), while A. parasiticus  produces 
both B and G aflatoxins, but not CPA. Aflatoxin M1 is a metabolite of aflatoxin B1 that can occur in milk and milk products from animals 
226Aflatoxins
consuming feed contaminated with B aflatoxins 
(IARC, 2002 ).
Aspergillus  species capable of producing afla -
toxins include A. flavus , A. parasiticus , A. nomius , 
A. pseudotamarii , A. bombycis , A. ochraceoroseus , 
and A. australis ( IARC, 2002 ). A. flavus  and A. 
parasiticus  are responsible for the largest propor -
tion of aflatoxins found in foodstuffs throughout 
the world. Of the other species, only A. australis , 
which appears to be widespread in the southern 
hemisphere and is common in Australian peanut 
soils, may also be an important source of afla -
toxins in some countries ( IARC, 2002 ).
Because of the importance of aflatoxins, A. 
flavus  has become the most widely reported 
foodborne fungus – even with the proviso that A. 
parasiticus  is sometimes not differentiated from 
A. flavus  in general mycological studies. A. flavus  
is especially abundant in the tropics. Levels of A. flavus  in warm temperate climates such as in the 
USA and Australia are generally much lower, while the occurrence of A. flavus  is uncommon 
in cool temperate climates, except in foods and 
feeds imported from tropical countries ( IARC, 
2002 ).
The major hosts of A. flavus  among food 
and feed commodities are maize, peanuts, and 
cottonseed [Note: the terms maize and peanuts will be used throughout this Volume for corn and 
groundnuts, respectively]. In addition, various 
spices sometimes contain aflatoxins, while tree nuts are contaminated less frequently. Small 
amounts of aflatoxins may be found in a wide 
range of other foods ( IARC, 2002 ).
It seems probable that although A. parasiti-
cus occurs in the same geographical range as A. 
flavus , it is less widely distributed. In particular, 
it has been found only rarely in south-eastern 
Asia. The food-related hosts of A. parasiticus  are 
similar to those of A. flavus , except that A. para -
siticus  is very uncommon in maize ( IARC, 2002 ).
With maize, peanuts, and cottonseed, inva -
sion of plants and developing seed or nut by 
Aspergillus spp.  may occur before harvest, resulting in potentially high levels of aflatoxins in these commodities and the continuing diffi -
culty to eliminate aflatoxins from these products. With other crops, prevention of the formation of aflatoxins relies mainly on avoidance of contam -
ination after harvest by use of rapid drying and good storage practice ( IARC, 2002 ).
Apart from natural formation, aflatoxins are 
produced only in small quantities for research purposes, by fermentation of A. flavus  or A. 
parasiticus  on solid substrates or media in the 
laboratory. Aflatoxins are extracted by solvents and purified by chromatography ( IARC, 1993 ).
1.3 Human exposure
1.3.1  Exposure of the general population
Dietary intake is the primary non-occupa -
tional source of human exposure to aflatoxins. 
Intakes in the range of nanograms to micrograms 
per day occur mainly through consumption of maize and peanuts, which are dietary staples in 
some tropical countries ( IARC, 2002 ).
Aflatoxins have been found in a variety of agri -
cultural commodities, but the most pronounced contamination has been encountered in maize, 
peanuts, cottonseed, and tree nuts. An extensive review of the amounts of aflatoxins in commodi -
ties in North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Africa was included in IARC Monograph  
Volume 56 ( IARC, 1993 ). More recent data were 
compiled in IARC Monograph  Volume 82 ( IARC, 
2002 ).
Surveys of selected foods for the presence of 
aflatoxins in many countries have continued to detect some level of contamination; the amounts are highly variable, ranging from < 0.1 µg/kg to 
hundreds of µg/kg depending on source, food 
type, climate, storage conditions, and other factors ( IARC, 2002 ). The fraction of samples 
with detectable levels of aflatoxin B1 or total aflatoxins (B1, B2, G1 and G2) can range from a few percent (e.g. 6.9% of imported peanuts 
227IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
in Japan, 1999–2000; Okano et al ., 2003 ) to as 
much as 30% or more (e.g. maize in some parts 
of Latin America and Asia ( IARC, 2002 ). Data 
on the occurrence of aflatoxin M1 in milk were 
summarized in the previous IARC Monograph  
(IARC, 1993 ).
From the point of view of dietary intake, afla -
toxins in staple foods such as maize are almost all 
pervading. This contamination poses a far greater 
problem in the tropics than in temperate zones of the world. However, because of the movement of 
agricultural commodities around the globe, no 
region of the world is free from aflatoxins ( IARC, 
2002 ).
International exposure estimates on the 
intake of aflatoxins were summarized in IARC Monograph  Volume 82 ( IARC, 2002 ). These esti -
mates include data from the 1995 compendium, Worldwide Regulations for Mycotoxins and the 1998 and 2001 reports of the Joint FAO/WHO 
Expert Committee on Food Additives ( JECFA, 
1998 , 2001 ). The occurrence and assessment 
of aflatoxins in human biological fluids and tissues (e.g. cord blood, cord serum, and breast 
milk) were summarized in the previous IARC 
Monograph  (IARC, 2002 ).
Several recent studies have addressed the 
early detection, prevention and control of afla -
toxins in the food and feed chain around the 
world ( Williams et al ., 2004 ; Kabak et al ., 2006 ; 
Magan, 2006 ; Strosnider et al ., 2006 ; Bryden, 
2007 ; Kendra & Dyer, 2007 ; Magan & Aldred, 2007 ; Wagacha & Muthomi, 2008 ). These publi -
cations described pre- and post- harvest strate -
gies (such as field management, use of biological and chemical agents, improved drying and storage conditions, irradiation, moisture control, 
biocompetitiveness and biotechnology (e.g. 
transgenic expression of maize-specific genes)) and early detection methods (such as molecular 
imprinted polymers, lateral-flow devices, and 
molecular-based technology).
1.3.2  Occupational exposure
Occupational exposure to aflatoxins can 
occur during processing and handling of contam -
inated grains, particularly animal feed. Airborne concentrations at the workplace are typically in the ng/m
3-range, but higher concentrations (up 
to µg/m3) have been reported.
Estimates of the number of workers poten -
tially exposed to aflatoxins in Europe have been developed by CAREX, an international informa -
tion system on occupational exposures to known 
and suspected carcinogens collected in the 
period 1990–1993. This CAREX (CARcinogen 
EXposure) database provides selected exposure 
data and documented estimates of the number of exposed workers by country, carcinogen, 
and industry ( Kauppinen et al ., 2000 ). Table  1.1  
presents the results for aflatoxins in the European 
Union ( CAREX, 1999 ).
Few studies have evaluated occupational 
exposures to aflatoxins ( IARC, 2002 ).

Selim et al . (1998)  collected dust samples 
from 28 farms in the United States during 
harvest and unloading, animal feeding, and bin 
cleaning. Aflatoxin concentrations ranged from 0.00004 to 4.8 μg/m
3. The lowest concentrations 
were detected during harvest and unloading, the 
highest during bin cleaning.
Brera et al . (2002)  collected and analysed 
a total of 44 full-shift samples (26 personal samples, 18 ambient-air samples) to determine 
airborne concentrations of aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, and G2 in dust collected at three food-processing 
plants (cocoa, coffee, and spices) in Tuscany, Italy. 
Concentrations ranged from below the detection limit (< 0.002 ng/m
3), to 0.130 ng/m3.
2. Cancer in Humans
2.1 Hepatocellular carcinoma
2.1.1  Previous evaluation
Aflatoxins were last evaluated in IARC 
Monograph  Volume 82 (2002) and confirmed as 
a Group-1 agent. The weight of evidence for the classification of the aflatoxins as Group-1 carcin -
ogens was driven by statistically significantly 
increased risks for hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC) in individuals exposed to aflatoxins, as measured by aflatoxin-specific biomarkers in 
cohort studies in Shanghai and Taiwan, China 
(Ross et al ., 1992 ; Qian et al ., 1994 ; Wang et al ., 
1996 ). This effect was independent of exposure 
to hepatitis B virus (HBV); however, when HBV status was included in the analysis, a greater than multiplicative interaction between aflatoxin 
exposure and HBV infection was found.
2.1.2  Cohort studies
See Table  2.1 available at http://
monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100F/100F-18-Table2.1.pdfThere has been no recent update of the 
cohort studied by Ross et al . (1992)  and Qian 
et al . (1994) . However, the cohort of Wang et 
al. (1996)  has been extensively updated in three 
subsequent reports ( Wu et al. 2007a , b, 2009 ). In 
these studies, the risk for HCC was significantly 
elevated for subjects with high concentrations of aflatoxin metabolites in the urine. Subjects 
who were seropositive for the hepatitis-B surface 
antigen (HBsAg) and had high aflatoxin expo -
sure were at higher risk than those with high 
aflatoxin exposure only, or HBsAg-seropositivity 
only. There seemed to be no correlation with poly -
cyclic aromatic hydrocarbon(PAH)-albumin-
adduct formation ( Wu et al. 2007a ). The risk was 
elevated in those with urinary concentrations of 
the biomarker 8-oxodeoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) 
above the median, who were also HBsAg-positive 
(Wu et al., 2007b ). In one small cohort the risk for 
HCC from aflatoxin exposure was also elevated 
(Ming et al. 2002 ).
2.1.3  Case-series and case–control studies
(a) Aflatoxin-specific TP53 mutations
In recent years, epidemiological and experi -
mental studies have linked exposures to afla -
toxin with the formation of a specific mutation in codon 249 in the TP53  tumour-suppressor 
gene, which has provided an important biolog -
ical target for risk assessment. The identification of a strong mechanistic link between exposure 
to aflatoxin and mutation in TP53  has triggered 
analyses of this codon-249 mutation in tumour 
tissues and blood samples in populations at high 
risk for HCC. In case-series of HCC patients in China, the prevalence of this mutation ranged 
from 36–54% ( Jackson et al ., 2001 , 2003 ; Stern 
et al ., 2001 ; Ming et al ., 2002 ). In the one case–
control study in China, Huang et al. (2003)  found 
an adjusted odds ratio of 22.1 (95%CI: 3.2–91.7) 
for the presence of a codon-249 TP53  mutation 
among HCC cases compared with controls. In 
contrast, case-series in Africa found a much 
229IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
lower prevalence of this type of mutation in some 
populations, ranging from 1% in one study in 
Egypt to 35% in The Gambia, West Africa.
(b) Metabolic polymorphisms and HCC risk from 
aflatoxin
See Table  2.2 available at http://
monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100F/100F-18-Table2.2.pdf .
The availability of aflatoxin-specific biomar -
kers has enhanced the possibility to monitor individual exposure to this agent. In three case–
control studies (two nested within cohorts) an 
analysis of a variety of genetic polymorphisms as probable modifiers of risk from aflatoxin, has 
been undertaken in regions of high HCC inci -
dence ( Sun et al., 2001 ; McGlynn et al., 2003 ; Kirk 
et al ., 2005 ). These polymorphisms are predi -
cated on the hypothesis that enhanced detoxica -
tion or activation pathways of aflatoxin exposure 
will be a surrogate biomarker of exposure. All 
studies were limited because of small numbers of 
subjects in high-risk strata, but two studies were consistent in finding an increased risk for HCC 
among those with the GSTM1 -null genotype, 
and in one of these studies the risk was elevated 
among those with the highest consumption of 
peanuts (an index of consumption of aflatoxin-
contaminated food).
(c) Aflatoxin biomarkers of exposure
See Table  2.3 available at http://
monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/
vol100F/100F-18-Table2.3.pdf .
Biomarkers of exposure to aflatoxin have 
been evaluated for association with risk for HCC in two case–control studies. The risk was 
significantly higher in those who were HBAsG-
positive ( Omer et al., 2001 , 2004 ; Liu et al., 2008 ), 
in those who carried the GSTM1 -null genotype 
(Omer et al ., 2001 ), and in those with oxidative 
stress ( Liu et al., 2008 ). In one study, it was deter -
mined that the attributable risk for the effects of exposure to aflatoxin and HBsAg-positivity was of the order of 80% ( Omer et al., 2004 ).
2.2 Synthesis
Geographically distinct cohort studies in 
Shanghai and Taiwan, China have independ -
ently found statistically significant effects of exposure to aflatoxin on the development of HCC. These results, buttressed by the informa -
tion from several case-series and case–control studies also confirm that in the presence of HBV exposure, as judged by HBsAg status, there is a 
greater than multiplicative interaction between 
aflatoxin and HBV, increasing the risk for HCC. Further evidence of the role of aflatoxins in the 
development of HCC was gained from studies 
that demonstrated the ability of aflatoxins to induce a specific mutation in codon 249 of the 
TP53  tumour-suppressor gene.
3. Cancer in Experimental Animals
3.1 Previous evaluations
Carcinogenicity studies in experimental 
animals, with administration of aflatoxin mixtures and aflatoxin B1, B2, M1, G1, or G2 to 
rats, mice, hamsters, salmon, trout, ducks, tree shrews, woodchucks and monkeys by several 
routes of exposure have been previously reviewed 
(IARC, 1993 , 2002 ).
See Table 3.1 .
The two previous IARC evaluations 
concluded that there was sufficient evidence  for 
the carcinogenicity in experimental animals 
of naturally occurring mixtures of aflatoxins 
and of the individual aflatoxins B1, G1, and M1; there was limited evidence  for aflatoxin B2, 
and inadequate  evidence for aflatoxin G2. This 
Monograph  reviews relevant carcinogenicity 
studies published since 2002.

3.2 Aflatoxin B1
3.2.1  Transgenic mouse
An 11-month study was conducted with 
transgenic mice deficient in the XPA ( Xeroderma 
pigmentosum  A) protein. This protein recognizes 
various types of DNA damage, binds to the 
damaged DNA region and functions in the first 
step of the nucleotide excision-repair process. 
Treatment of these XPA–/– mice with a single 
dose of aflatoxin B1 given by intraperitoneal 
injection resulted in an increased incidence of 
liver carcinomas compared with the incidence in wild-type mice ( Takahashi et al ., 2002 ). An 
18-month study in Hupki (human TP53  knock-
in) transgenic mice that received a single dose of aflatoxin B1 by intraperitoneal injection, showed 
increased incidences of hepatocellular adenomas 
(P  =  0.041) and carcinomas ( P  =  0.057) ( Tong 
et al., 2006 ). A 12–13 month study in FVB/N and 
p53
+/– mice (with or without transgenic hepatitis-
B virus expression) exposed to a single dose of 
aflatoxin B1 by intraperitoneal injection, showed 
liver tumours (hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas combined) in p53
+/– HBV-transgenic 
male mice ( Cullen et al., 2009 ).
These three studies in mice confirm earlier 
findings of Schnur et al . (1999)  of an increased 
incidence of liver tumours (mainly adenomas) in 
TGF-β1-transgenic mice given aflatoxin B1.
3.2.2  Rat
An intraperitoneal study in Wistar rats 
confirmed that aflatoxin B1 is a liver carcinogen in this species ( Hao et al., 2009 ).
3.2.3  Tree shrew
A carcinogenicity study to detect alterations 
in the p53  and p21  genes in hepatocellular carci -
nomas in tree shrews infected with HBV showed 
an increased incidence of hepatocellular carci -
nomas in animals that had received aflatoxin by the oral route ( Su et al ., 2004 ). This finding 
was confirmed by Duan et al. (2005)  and Li et al. 
(2008)  in similar studies.
3.2.4  Trout
A study by Tilton et al . (2005)  confirmed 
that aflatoxin B1 is a liver carcinogen in trout. 
In this study, trout embryos were exposed for 30 
minutes to water containing 50 ppb aflatoxin F1, and kept for a further 13 months.
3.3 Aflatoxin G1
3.3.1  Mouse
A 58–74-week study in NIH mice given afla -
toxin G1 by gavage resulted in an increased inci -
dence in lung adenocarcinomas ( Huang et al ., 
2004 ).
3.4 Synthesis
Table 3.1  lists the more recent studies 
described above and also summarizes several of 
the previously evaluated studies.
Results of additional carcinogenicity studies 
in animals reported since the previous IARC evaluations are consistent with the conclusions 
of previous Working Groups. Studies performed with trouts (whole-body exposure), in transgenic 
mouse models (by intraperitoneal injection), in 
mice (by gavage), and in tree shrews (via the diet) strengthen the original conclusions of sufficient 
evidence  for carcinogenicity in experimental 
animals of aflatoxin B1 and G1. Aflatoxin B1 
increases the incidence of liver cancer in rats, tree 
shrews, trouts, and transgenic mice. Aflatoxin 
G1 increases the incidence of liver cancer in rats.
235IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
4. Other Relevant Data
Experimental studies on aflatoxins have been 
reviewed in previous IARC Monographs  (IARC, 
1993 , 2002 ). There is an extensive body of infor -
mation related to the mechanism of aflatoxin-
induced carcinogenicity, encompassing data 
on toxicokinetics, metabolism, genotoxicity, 
molecular biology, interactive effects with HBV, and human susceptibility factors. Aflatoxins 
are naturally occurring mycotoxins that are 
well documented hepatocarcinogens in humans (IARC, 1993 , 2002 ; Gomaa et al ., 2008 ). At least 
13 different types of aflatoxin are found natu -
rally. Aflatoxin B1 is considered the most potent of the aflatoxins and is produced by Aspergillus 
flavus  and Aspergillus parasiticus . Aflatoxin B1 is 
genotoxic in prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems 
in vitro , including cultured human cells, and in 
vivo in humans and in a variety of animal species. 
Exposure to aflatoxin B1 induces adducts to DNA and albumin, gene mutations and chromosomal 
alterations including micronuclei and sister 
chromatid exchange, and mitotic recombina -
tion. Exposure to aflatoxin B1 is mechanistically 
associated with a specific AGG→AGT transver -
sion mutation in codon 249 of the TP53  gene 
in human hepatocellular carcinoma, providing mechanistic support for a causal link between 
exposure and disease ( Gomaa et al., 2008 ).
The key steps in the mechanism of carcino -
genicity of aflatoxins involve metabolism to the reactive exo-epoxide, binding of the exo-epoxide 
to DNA resulting in formation of DNA adducts, 
and miscoding in replicating DNA, which leads 
to development of mutations with eventual progression to tumours. Biological interactions 
with HBV also play a role in the hepatic carcino -
genicity of aflatoxins in humans ( IARC, 2002 ).4.1 Toxicokinetics
Rigorous quantitative comparisons of dietary 
intakes and the amount of aflatoxin metabolites in body fluids following absorption and distribu -
tion are lacking. As noted in previous Monographs  
(IARC, 1993 , 2002 ), aflatoxin M1 concentrations 
in human urine and human breast milk have 
been correlated with dietary aflatoxin intake (Gan et al ., 1988 ; JECFA, 2001 ). Using aflatoxin-
specific monoclonal antibody-based immu -
noaffinity chromatography, Wild et al . (1992)  
measured aflatoxin concentrations in cooked 
foods in a village in The Gambia. Estimated 
intakes of aflatoxins were less than those derived from the levels of aflatoxin–serum adducts and 
the concentrations in urine of the same individ -
uals ( Wild et al ., 1992 ). In humans, as in other 
species, the DNA binding and carcinogenicity of aflatoxin B1 result from its conversion to the 
8,9-epoxide by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (Essigmann et al., 1982 ; Guengerich, et al., 1998 ). 
There is interindividual variation in the rate of activation of aflatoxins, including differences between children and adults. These differences 
may be relevant to the pharmacokinetics of afla -
toxins, which in humans have still not been fully 
elucidated ( Ramsdell & Eaton, 1990 ; Wild et al ., 
1990 ).
Factors that explain differences in the 
response to aflatoxin between human indi -
viduals and animal species and strains include the proportion of aflatoxin metabolized to the 8,9-exo-epoxide (mainly by CYP enzymes) 
relative to other, much less toxic metabolites, and the prevalence of pathways that lead to the formation of non-toxic conjugates with reduced 
mutagenicity and cytotoxicity ( Guengerich et al., 
1998 ).
After dermal application, aflatoxin B1 is 
absorbed via the skin in rats ( Wei et al ., 1970 ). 
Aflatoxins are absorbed from the gut of sheep 
(Wilson et al., 1985 ) and rats ( Kumagai, 1989 ) and 
distributed via the blood, not by the lymphatic 
236Aflatoxins
system. In rats, absorption after intratracheal 
instillation is more rapid than after an oral dose, 
but the body distribution and excretion patterns 
are not different for these two routes of admin -
istration ( Coulombe & Sharma, 1985 ). When a 
tracheally administered dose was first adsorbed onto dust, the binding of aflatoxin B1 to lung and tracheal DNA was increased and retention in the 
trachea was prolonged, compared with admin -
istration of microcrystalline aflatoxin B1 alone 
(Coulombe et al ., 1991 ). Aflatoxin is also rapidly 
absorbed after inhalation by the rat, resulting in the formation of hepatic DNA adducts ( Zarba 
et al ., 1992 ). Aflatoxin B1 as weIl as aflatoxin M
1 
are concentrated in the liver of rats 30 minutes 
after an intraperitoneal or oral dose of 7 mg/kg 
bw 14C-aflatoxin B1; at 24 hours, both aflatoxins 
were detected only as traces ( Wogan, 1969 ). 
In-vitro studies with bovine melanin have shown that unmetabolized aflatoxin B1 binds reversibly to this pigment ( Larsson et al., 1988 ).
More aflatoxin-B1 metabolites are usually 
excreted in rat faeces than in urine after intra -
peritoneal injection of [
14C]-ring-labelled 
aflatoxin B1 ( Wogan, 1969 ). Intraperitoneal 
co-injection of [3H]-glutathione and aflatoxin B1 
(AFB1) in rats showed that the excretion of [3H]-
GSH–AFB1conjugates proceeds almost exclu -
sively through the bile: 14% of the radioactivity was excreted as the conjugate by this route, and only traces were found in urine ( Emerole, 1981 ). 
Degradation of aflatoxin B1–glutathione conju -
gate by enzymes of the mercapturic-acid pathway has been described in rat-kidney preparations in 
vitro  (Moss et al ., 1985 ). The extent of urinary 
excretion of aflatoxin B1–mercapturate, together with the sulfate and glucuronide conjugates, 
correlates with species-sensitivity to aflatoxin B1 
(Raj & Lotlikar, 1984 ).
In a more recent study, aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) 
was administered to rats by gavage for nine consecutive days at eight dose levels ranging from 50 pg/kg bw to 55 μg/kg bw ( Scholl 
et al., 2006 ). The dose–response relationship was linear-quadratic, with an upward curvature at higher doses. The adduct yield [(pg Lys-AFB1/
mg albumin)/(μg AFB1/kg body wt)] increased 
sixfold, nonlinearly with the dose between the 0.05- and 55-μg AFB
1/kg bw groups, and showed 
the onset of saturation in the highest dose group, 
where the adduct yield was approximately 2%.
A recent study by Jubert et al. (2009)  investi-
gated aflatoxin-B1 pharmacokinetics in human volunteers by use of microdosing techniques 
and Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS). The kinetics of low-dose aflatoxin B1 were investi -
gated in three volunteers who received an oral dose of 30 ng [
14C]-labelled aflatoxin. AMS was 
used to measure the levels of aflatoxin equiva -
lents in plasma and urine. Pharmacokinetic modelling of absorption and disposition showed that excretion was rapid, with 95% of the total 
urinary aflatoxin-B1 equivalents produced 
within the first 24 hours. Absorption of aflatoxin-B1 equivalents into the systemic circulation 
was also rapid, with peak concentrations being 
reached within approximately 1 hour. Changes in plasma concentrations of aflatoxin-B1 equiv -
alents following intervention in each subject mirrored those seen in urine. The authors did not discriminate between free aflatoxin B1 and 
its various metabolites or conjugates. Based on 
total [
14C] equivalents, aflatoxin B1 was rapidly 
absorbed into plasma in all volunteers, with first-
order kinetics.
4.2 Metabolism
The metabolism of aflatoxin B1 in humans 
and laboratory animals has been well character -
ized ( Essigmann et al., 1982 ; Eaton & Gallagher, 
1994 ; McLean & Dutton, 1995 ; Gallagher et al ., 
1996 ; Code et al ., 1997 ; Guengerich et al ., 1998 ; 
Ueng et al ., 1998 ; IARC, 2002 ). CYP1A2, 2B6, 
3A4, 3A5, 3A7 and GSTM1 are enzymes that 
mediate aflatoxin metabolism in humans. The 
overall contribution of these enzymes to afla -
toxin-B1 metabolism in vivo  will depend not 
237IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
only on their affinity but also on their expression 
level in human liver, where CYP3A4 is predomi -
nant. This enzyme mediates the formation of the exo-epoxide and aflatoxin Q
1, while CYP1A2 
can generate some exo -epoxide but also a high 
proportion of endo -epoxide and aflatoxin M1. 
In vitro  evidence that both these enzymes are 
responsible for aflatoxin metabolism in humans has been substantiated by biomarker studies. Aflatoxins M
1 and Q1, produced by CYP1A2 
and 3A4, respectively, are present in the urine 
of individuals exposed to aflatoxin ( Ross et al ., 
1992 ; Qian et al ., 1994 ). In humans, as in other 
species, the DNA-binding and carcinogenicity of aflatoxin B1 result from its conversion to the afla -
toxin B1 8,9- exo-epoxide by CYP3A4 ( Essigmann 
et al., 1982 ). This epoxide is highly reactive and is 
the main mediator of cellular injury ( McLean & 
Dutton, 1995 ).
CYP3A5, in contrast to CYP3A4, metabo -
lizes aflatoxin B1 mainly to the exo -8,9-epoxide 
but is about 100-fold less efficient in catalysing 
3-hydroxylation of aflatoxin B1 to yield the afla -
toxin Q
1 metabolite ( Wang et al ., 1998 ). Hepatic 
CYP3A5 expression differs markedly between 
individuals. Factors that explain the variation in 
response to aflatoxin among human individuals, animal species and strains include the proportion 
of aflatoxin metabolized to the 8,9- exo and endo -
epoxide relative to other, much less toxic meta-
bolites and the prevalence of pathways forming 
non-toxic conjugates with reduced mutagen -
icity and cytotoxicity ( Eaton & Gallagher, 1994; 
McLean & Dutton, 1995 ; Guengerich et al., 1998 ).
The expression of enzymes involved in 
aflatoxin metabolism can be modulated with 
chemopreventive agents, resulting in inhibi -
tion of DNA-adduct formation and hepato -
carcinogenesis, as has been demonstrated in rats. Oltipraz is a chemopreventive agent that 
increases glutathione conjugation and inhibits 
the activity of some cytochrome P450 enzymes (e.g. CYP1A2). Results from clinical trials with 
oltipraz in the People’s Republic of China are consistent with experimental data in showing 
that, following dietary exposure to aflatoxins, 
modulation of the metabolism of aflatoxins can 
lead to reduced levels of DNA adducts ( IARC, 
2002 ; Kensler et al., 2005 ).
There are marked interspecies differences in 
sensitivity to aflatoxin-induced carcinogenesis (Gorelick, 1990 ; Eaton & Gallagher, 1994; Eaton 
& Groopman, 1994 ). For example, the adult 
mouse is almost completely refractory to tumour formation except under conditions of partial 
hepatectomy, or as a result of liver injury through 
expression of transgenically induced hepatitis-B virus antigens. In contrast, the rat is extremely 
sensitive. A considerable part of this interspe -
cies variation is understood in terms of differ -
ences in activation and detoxification activities of aflatoxin-metabolizing enzymes in the path -
ways described above ( IARC, 2002 ). Microsomal 
preparations from mice show a higher specific activity for aflatoxin-B1 8,9-epoxide production 
than those from the rat ( Ramsdell & Eaton, 1990 ). 
However, in the mouse, the resistance to afla -
toxin carcinogenesis is largely, if not exclusively, explained by the constitutive hepatic expression of an α-class GST, mGSTA3–3, a detoxifying 
enzyme with a high affinity for aflatoxin B1 
8,9-epoxide ( Buetler & Eaton, 1992 ; Hayes et al., 
1992 ). In contrast, rats do not constitutively 
express a GST isoform with high epoxide-conju -
gating activity, but they do express an inducible α-class GST (rGSTA5–5) with high activity. The 
induction of this enzyme plays a major role in 
the resistance of rats to aflatoxin-B
1-induced 
hepatocarcinogenicity following treatment with 
enzyme inducers including oltipraz, ethoxyquin 
and butylated hydroxyanisole ( Kensler et al ., 
1986 , 1987 ; Hayes et al ., 1991 , 1994 ; Pulford & 
Hayes, 1996 ).
Current knowledge of the molecular mechan-
isms of aflatoxin-induced carcinogenesis 
contributes to the understanding of the nature 
of the biological interaction between hepatitis B virus (HBV) and aflatoxins in determining the 
238Aflatoxins
risk for hepatocellular carcinoma ( IARC, 2002 ). 
In Asia and Africa, where the majority of cases 
are found, aflatoxins and hepatitis viruses (HBV 
and HCV) are important factors giving rise to extraordinarily high incidence rates (24.2–
35.5/100000) of hepatocellular carcinoma. In 
these areas, HBV-induced chronic active hepa -
titis and cirrhosis constitute major risk factors 
for liver cancer.
Infection with HBV may increase aflatoxin 
metabolism. In HBV-infected children in The Gambia there was a higher level of aflatoxin–
albumin adducts than in non-infected children, an observation consistent with altered aflatoxin 
metabolism ( Allen et al., 1992 ; Turner et al., 2000 ). 
However, similar studies in adults did not show 
such differences ( Groopman et al ., 1992 ; Wild 
et al., 2000 ). Glutathione S-transferase activity is 
reduced in human liver in the presence of HBV infection ( Zhou et al ., 1997 ). In HBV-transgenic 
mice, liver injury is associated with increased expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes ( Kirby 
et al., 1994 ).
4.3 Aflatoxin –albumin adducts
4.3.1  Aflatoxin –albumin adducts as 
biomarkers of exposure in children
Gong et al. (2003)  conducted a cross-sectional 
study in Benin and Togo to investigate aflatoxin 
exposure in children around the time of weaning 
and correlated these data with food consumption, socioeconomic status, agro-ecological zone of 
residence, and anthropometric measures. Blood 
samples from 479 children (age, 9  months to 5 years) from 16 villages in four agro-ecological 
zones were assayed for aflatoxin–albumin adducts 
as a measure of recent (2–3 months) past expo -
sure. Aflatoxin–albumin adducts were detected 
in 475/479 (99%) children (geometric mean 
32.8 pg/mg, 95%CI: 25.3–42.5). Adduct levels varied markedly across agro-ecological zones, 
with mean values being approximately four times higher in the central than in the northern region. 
The aflatoxin–albumin adduct level increased 
with age up to three years, and was significantly 
(P  =  0.0001) related to weaning status of the 
1–3-year age group: weaned children had approx -
imately twofold higher mean aflatoxin–albumin adduct levels (38 pg aflatoxin–lysine equivalents per mg of albumin [pg/mg]) than those receiving 
a mixture of breast milk and solid foods, after 
adjustment for age, sex, agro-ecological zone, and socioeconomic status. A higher intake of 
maize, but not peanuts, in the preceding week 
was correlated with higher aflatoxin–albumin adduct levels in the children. The prevalence of 
stunted growth (height for age Z-score, HAZ) 
and being underweight (weight for age Z-score, WAZ) were 33% and 29%, respectively, by World 
Health Organization criteria. Children in these 
two categories had 30–40% higher mean afla -
toxin–albumin levels than the remainder of the 
children, and strong dose–response relationships 
were observed between aflatoxin–albumin levels and the extent of stunting and being under -
weight. Polychronaki et al . (2008)  investigated 
aflatoxin exposure in Egyptian children ( n = 50; 
age, 1–2.5 years) by assessing urinary aflatoxin 
metabolites (AFM1, AFB1, AFB2, AFG1, AFG2). 
Samples from Guinean children ( n  =  50; age, 
2–4 years) were analysed in parallel, providing a 
comparison with a region of established, frequent 
exposure to aflatoxin. Overall, aflatoxins were less frequently present in Egyptian (38%) than 
in Guinean urine samples (86%) ( P <  0 . 0 0 1 ) .  
For AFM1, the geometric mean level in Guinea 
(16.3 pg/ml; 95%CI: 10.1–26.6 pg/ml) was six 
times higher ( P < 0.001) than in Egypt (2.7 pg/ml; 
95%CI: 2.5–2.8 pg/ml).

4.3.2  Aflatoxin –albumin adducts as 
biomarkers of exposure in intervention 
trials
The aflatoxin-biomarker studies in popula -
tions at high risk for HCC have stimulated the 
development of interventions to reduce exposure 
to aflatoxins. In the study by Turner et al. (2005) , 
aflatoxin biomarkers were used to assess whether 
post-harvest measures to restrict aflatoxin 
contamination of peanut crops could reduce exposure in the lower Kindia region of Guinea. 
Farms from 20 villages were included, ten of 
which implemented a package of post-harvest measures to restrict aflatoxin contamination of 
the peanut crops; ten controls followed usual 
post-harvest practices. The concentrations of aflatoxin–albumin adducts from 600 people were 
measured immediately after harvest, and three 
and five months later, to monitor the effectiveness of the intervention. In control villages the mean 
aflatoxin–albumin concentration increased from 
5.5 pg/mg (95%CI: 4.7–6.1) immediately after harvest to 18.7 pg/mg (17.0–20.6) five months 
later. By contrast, the mean aflatoxin–albumin 
concentration in intervention villages after five months of peanuts storage was similar to that 
immediately post-harvest (7.2 pg/mg [6.2–8.4] vs  
8.0 pg/mg [7.0–9.2]). At five months, the mean 
adduct concentration in intervention villages was 
less than 50% of the values in control villages (8.0 
vs 18.7 pg/mg; P  < 0.0001). About a third of the 
people had non-detectable aflatoxin–albumin 
concentrations at harvest. At five months, five 
persons (2%) in the control villages had non-detectable adduct concentrations, compared 
with 47 (20%) of the subjects in the intervention 
group ( P < 0.0001).
4.4 Aflatoxin –DNA adducts
Formation of DNA adducts through reac -
tion with metabolically activated aflatoxin is 
well characterized. The primary site of adduct formation in DNA is the N7 position of the 
guanine base ( Guengerich et al., 1998 ). Aflatoxin 
B1 is activated to its 8,9- exo-epoxide, which 
reacts with DNA to form the 8,9-dihydro-8-
(N7-guanosinyl)-9-hydroxy aflatoxin B1 (AFB1–
N7-Guo) adduct. This adduct represents more 
than 98% of the total adducts formed by the 8,9-exo-epoxide ( Guengerich et al., 1998 ).
The positively charged imidazole ring of 
the guanosine adduct promotes depurination and consequently, apurinic site formation. As a 
result, the purine-adduct aflatoxin- N7-guanine 
can be measured in the urine (see below). Under 
slightly alkaline conditions, the imidazole ring 
of AFB1– N7-Guo is opened and forms the more 
stable – not depurinating – ring-open aflatoxin 
B1–formamidopyrimidine adduct ( Groopman 
et al., 1981 ).
DNA and protein adducts of aflatoxin have 
been detected in many studies in human liver 
and in body fluids. Some studies related the level 
of adducts to polymorphisms in metabolizing enzymes, to investigate interindividual suscepti -
bility to aflatoxin ( IARC, 1993 , 2002 ).
4.4.1  Aflatoxin –DNA adducts as biomarkers 
in intervention trials
Egner et al. (2001)  reported on a clinical trial 
with chlorophyllin in Qidong County, People’s 
Republic China. Chlorophyllin is a mixture of 
semisynthetic, water-soluble derivatives of chlo -
rophyll that has been shown in animal models 
to be an effective inhibitor of aflatoxin-induced 
hepatocarcinogenesis by blocking the bioavail -
ability of the carcinogen. A total of 180 adults 
from Qidong were randomly assigned to ingest 
100 mg of chlorophyllin or a placebo three times a day for four months. The primary endpoint was 
modulation of levels of aflatoxin-N 7-guanine 
adducts in urine samples collected three months 
into the intervention. Chlorophyllin consump -
tion at each meal led to an overall 55% reduc -
tion ( P = 0.036) in median urinary levels of this 
240Aflatoxins
aflatoxin biomarker compared with concentra -
tions in the urine of those taking the placebo.
Kensler et al. (2005)  described a randomized, 
placebo-controlled chemoprevention trial aimed 
at testing whether drinking hot-water infusions 
of three-day-old broccoli sprouts, containing 
defined concentrations of glucosinolates, could alter the disposition of aflatoxin. Two hundred 
healthy adults drank infusions containing either 
400 μmol or <  3 μmol glucoraphanin (control value) nightly for two weeks. An inverse asso -
ciation was observed for excretion of dithiocar -
bamates and aflatoxin-DNA adducts ( P = 0.002; 
R = 0.31) in individuals who consumed broccoli-
sprout glucosinolates.
4.5 Mutagenicity
Aflatoxin B1 induces mutations in Salmonella 
typhimurium  strains TA98 and TA100, and 
causes unscheduled DNA synthesis, chromo -
somal aberrations, sister chromatid exchange, 
micronucleus formation and cell transforma -
tion in various in vivo  and in vitro  mamma -
lian systems. For its mutagenicity, aflatoxin B1 is strongly dependent on metabolic activation 
with a rat-liver S9 fraction: the mutagenicity 
in Salmonella  tester strains TA98 and TA100 
without S9 was approximately 1000 times lower 
than in the presence of S9 ( IARC, 1993 , 2002 ).
Aflatoxin B1 can induce mitotic recombina -
tion in addition to point mutations ( IARC, 2002 ). 
This has been demonstrated in both yeast and 
mammalian cells. In human lymphoblastoid cells, aflatoxin B1 treatment resulted in mitotic 
recombination and loss of heterozygosity. A rever -
sion assay demonstrated aflatoxin B1-induced 
intrachromosomal recombination in a mutant 
cell-line derived from V79 cells that harbour 
an inactivating tandem-duplication in the Hprt  
gene. Aflatoxin B1 also induced recombination 
in minisatellite sequences in yeast expressing 
recombinant human CYP1A2. Liver tumours in HBV-transgenic mice – accumulating hepatitis-B surface antigen in the endoplasmic reticulum of the hepatocytes – treated with aflatoxin B1 trans -
placentally contained rearrangements in mini-satellite sequences after transplacental exposure to aflatoxin B1; no such alterations were seen 
in non-treated animals ( Kaplanski et al ., 1997 ). 
These findings suggest that aflatoxin can induce 
genetic instability in addition to point mutations. 
Mitotic recombination and genetic instability 
may therefore be two mechanisms by which aflatoxin may contribute to genetic alterations, 
such as loss of heterozygosity, in hepatocollular 
carcinoma.
Efforts to correlate biomarkers of aflatoxin 
exposure (i.e. adduct levels) with mutation indiction have given mixed results. In human subjects from Qidong County, People’s Republic 
of China, aflatoxin exposure was determined as 
high or low by measuring aflatoxin–albumin adduct levels in serum in comparison with the 
HPRT  mutant frequency in lymphocytes. A 
higher HPRT  mutant frequency was observed in 
subjects with high compared with low aflatoxin exposure ( Wang et al ., 1999 ). In a study in The 
Gambia, chromosomal aberrations, micronuclei 
and sister chromatid exchange were studied in 35 
adults, 32 of whom had measurable concentra -
tions of aflatoxin–albumin adducts. There was no 
correlation within this group between the cytoge -
netic alterations and aflatoxin–albumin adducts in peripheral blood at the individual level. In a further study, blood samples of 29 individuals of 
the same group were tested for DNA damage in 
the single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay, but no correlation was observed with aflatoxin–
albumin adducts or GSTM1  genotype ( Anderson 
et al., 1999 ).
4.6 Molecular lesions
It has been suggested that exposure to afla -
toxin B1 can lead to hepatocellular carcinoma through induction of a specific mutation in codon 
249 of the TP53  tumour-suppressor gene ( Gomaa 
241IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
et al ., 2008 ). Indeed, molecular analyses of 
human hepatocellular carcinomas have revealed 
a high prevalence of an AGG→AGT (Arg → Ser) 
transversion at codon 249 of the TP53  tumour-
suppressor gene (249ser mutation) in tumours 
from areas of the world where aflatoxin exposure 
was reported to be high ( Montesano et al., 1997 ). 
A large number of studies have been published 
on aflatoxin exposure and TP53  mutations; 
two meta-analyses examined the relationship 
between aflatoxin exposure, HBV infection and 
TP53  mutations in 20 ( Lasky & Magder, 1997 ) 
and in 48 published studies ( Stern et al., 2001 ).
In geographical correlation studies, expo -
sure to aflatoxin was associated with a specific 
G→T transversion in codon 249 of the TP53  
gene in human hepatocellular carcinoma. This 
alteration is consistent with the formation of the 
major aflatoxin B1– N7-guanine adduct and the 
observation that G→T mutations are predomi -
nant in cell culture and animal model systems. The high prevalence of the codon-249 mutation in human hepatocellular carcinoma, however, is 
only partly explained in experimental studies by 
sequence-specific binding and mutation induced by aflatoxin B1, or by an altered function of the 
p53 protein in studies of hepatocyte growth and 
transformation.
Preneoplastic lesions have been examined 
to define the time point in the natural history of hepatocellular carcinoma when the TP53  
mutation occurs. Hulla et al . (1993)  examined 
six hyperplastic nodules from rat liver that had developed three weeks after intraperitoneal injection with aflatoxin B1 followed by partial 
hepatectomy. No mutations at the codon-249 
equivalent were found. In other studies mice received intraperitoneal injections of aflatoxin 
B1 and were examined for tumours six to 14 
months later ( Tam et al ., 1999 ). Of the 71 lung 
tumours examined, 79% showed positive nuclear 
p53-staining. Analysis of microdissected tumour 
samples revealed mutations in different codons in exons 5, 6 and 7. Direct sequencing showed 26 mutations, which included nine G:C to A:T tran -
sitions, 11 A:T to G:C transitions and five trans -
versions (two G:C to T:A, two T:A to A:T and one A:T to C:G). The high mutation frequency and heterogeneous staining pattern suggested that 
TP53  mutations occur relatively late in aflatoxin-
B1-induced mouse lung tumorigenesis.
Investigations have been conducted to 
establish which DNA adduct is the most likely 
precursor of the mutations induced by aflatoxin B1. In several experimental systems these muta -
tions are certainly consistent with the main carcinogen-binding occurring at guanine in DNA, leading to G→T transversions ( IARC, 
1993 , 2002 ). When a pS189 shuttle vector was 
modified by aflatoxin B1 and then replicated in human Ad293 cells, predominantly G→T trans -
versions were detected ( Trottier et al ., 1992 ). 
However, other types of mutation have also been observed with aflatoxin B1. For example, Levy et 
al. (1992)  transfected an aflatoxin-B
1-modified 
shuttle vector into DNA repair-deficient (XP) 
or -proficient human (GM0637) fibroblasts, and 
examined mutations in the SUP-F  marker gene. 
Higher mutation frequencies were observed in 
the DNA repair-deficient cells and the location 
of mutations was significantly affected by repair proficiency. The majority of mutations were at 
GC base pairs: 50–70% were G →T transversions, 
but G→C transversions and G→A transitions were also frequent. A polymerase stop-assay 
was used to examine the of aflatoxin-B
1-binding 
site within the shuttle vector: no strong correla -
tion was found between initial binding sites and 
subsequent hotspots for mutation. This suggests that processing of adducts, e.g. during DNA 
replication and repair, can influence not only the 
overall mutation frequency but also the distribu -
tion of mutations within a gene.
A host-mediated assay was used to determine 
the pattern of mutagenesis induced by aflatoxin B1 in the lacI gene of E. coli  bacteria recovered 
from rat liver. Most of the 281 forward muta -
tions analysed were base substitutions at GC base 
242Aflatoxins
pairs; over half were GC→TA transversions, with 
other mutations evenly divided between GC→AT 
transitions and GC→CG transversions ( Prieto-
Alamo et al., 1996 ).
In a human lymphoblastoid cell line (h1A2v2) 
expressing the human recombinant CYP1A1 
enzyme, aflatoxin B1 (4 ng/mL; 25 hours) produced a hotspot GC→TA transversion muta -
tion at base pair 209 in exon 3 of the HPRT  gene 
in 10–17% of all mutants. This hotspot occurred at a GG GGGG sequence (target base underlined) 
(Cariello et al., 1994 ).
Bailey et al . (1996)  studied the induction of 
mutations resulting from two of the principal 
forms of DNA damage induced by aflatoxin 
B1, namely the AFB1– N7-Guo adduct and the 
ensuing apurinic sites, by site-directed mutagen -
esis. Single-stranded M13 bacteriophage DNA containing a unique AFB1– N7-Guo adduct or 
an apurinic site was used to transform E. coli . 
The predominant mutations with AFB1– N7-Guo 
were G→T transversions targeted to the site of the original adduct (approximately 74%), with lower 
frequencies of G→A transitions (13–18%) and 
G→C transversions (1–3%). Using E. coli  strains 
differing in biochemical activity of the UmuDC- 
and MucAB proteins – involved in processing of 
apurinic sites by insertion of dAMP – the authors showed that the mutations observed with AFB1–
N7-Guo were not predominantly a simple result 
of depurination of the initial adduct. A signifi -
cant number of base substitutions were located at the base 5 ′ to the site of the original adduct, 
representing around 13% of the total mutations. 
This induction of mutation at the base adjacent 
to the original site of damage was not observed 
with apurinic sites as the mutagenic lesion. It was suggested that this reflects interference with 
DNA replication following the intercalation 
of aflatoxin-B1–8,9-epoxide ( Gopalakrishnan 
et al., 1990 ).4.7 Synthesis
Several key steps in the development of hepa -
tocellular carcinoma induced by exposure to 
aflatoxin are well accepted ( Wild & Montesano, 
2009 ), and provide strong evidence that the mech -
anism of action of this agent involves metabolic activation to a genotoxic metabolite, formation 
of DNA adducts, and modification of the TP53  
gene. The concurrent presence of hepatitis B 
virus increases the incidence of hepatic tumours 
in humans. Aflatoxin B1 is the most common and potent of the aflatoxins. It is metabolized 
predominantly in the liver to an AFB1–8,9- exo-
epoxide, which forms a promutagenic AFB1-
N7-guanine DNA adduct that results in G→T 
transversion mutations. In human hepatocel -
lular cancers in areas where aflatoxin exposure is high, up to 50% of tumours have been shown to 
harbour a specific AGG→AGT point mutation in 
codon 249 of the TP53  tumour-suppressor gene 
(codon 249Ser mutation) ( Hussain et al ., 2007 ; 
Wild & Montesano, 2009 ).
5. Evaluation
There is sufficient evidence  in humans for the 
carcinogenicity of aflatoxins. Aflatoxins cause 
cancer of the liver (hepatocellular carcinoma).
There is sufficient evidence  in experimental 
animals for the carcinogenicity of naturally occurring mixtures of aflatoxins, and of afla -
toxin B1, G1 and M1.
There is limited evidence  in experimental 
animals for the carcinogenicity of aflatoxin B2.
There is inadequate evidence  in experimental 
animals for the carcinogenicity of aflatoxin G2.
There is strong evidence that the carcino -
genicity of aflatoxins operates by a genotoxic 
mechanism of action that involves metabolic 
activation to a genotoxic epoxide metabolite, 
formation of DNA adducts, and modification of the TP53 gene. In human hepatocellular 
243IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
carcinoma from areas where exposure to afla -
toxins is high, up to 50% of tumours have been 
shown to harbour a specific point mutation in 
the TP53  tumour-suppressor gene.
Aflatoxins are carcinogenic to humans

Conversion factor : ppm = 0.313 × mg/m31.2 Uses
Historically, benzene has been used as a 
component of inks in the printing industry, as a solvent for organic materials, as starting material 
and intermediate in the chemical and drug indus -
tries (e.g. to manufacture rubbers, lubricants, 
dyes, detergents, pesticides), and as an additive 
to unleaded gasoline ( NTP, 20 05 ; ATSDR, 2007 ; 
Williams et al. , 2008 ).
The primary use of benzene today is in the 
manufacture of organic chemicals. In Europe, benzene is mainly used to make styrene, phenol, 
cyclohexane, aniline, maleic anhydride, alkyl-
benzenes and chlorobenzenes. It is an inter -
mediate in the production of anthraquinone, 
hydroquinone, benzene hexachloride, benzene 
sulfonic acid and other products used in drugs, dyes, insecticides and plastics ( Burridge, 2007 ). 
In the United States of America, the primary use of benzene is in the production of ethylbenzene, accounting for 52% of the total benzene demand 
in 2008. Most ethylbenzene is consumed in the 
manufacture of styrene, which is used in turn in polystyrene and various styrene copoly -
mers, latexes and resins. The second-largest use of benzene in the United States of America (accounting for 22% of demand) is in the manu -
facture of cumene (isopropylbenzene), nearly BENZENE
Benzene was considered by previous IARC Working Groups in 1981 and 1987 ( IARC, 1982 , 
1987 ). Since that time new data have become available, which have been incorporated in 
this Monograph,  and taken into consideration in the present evaluation.IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
all of which is consumed in phenol production. 
Benzene is also used to make chemical intermedi -
ates: cyclohexane, used in making certain nylon monomers (15%); nitrobenzene, an intermediate for aniline and other products (7%); alkylben -
zene, used in detergents (2%); chlorobenzenes, used in engineering polymers (1%); and miscel -
laneous other uses (1%) ( Kirschner, 2009 ). 
Benzene occurs naturally in petroleum products (e.g. crude oil and gasoline) and is also added to unleaded gasoline for its octane-enhancing and 
anti-knock properties. Typically, the concentra -
tion of benzene in these fuels is 1–2% by volume 
(ATSDR, 2007 ).
1.3 Human exposure
1.3.1  Occupational exposure
Occupational exposure to benzene occurs via 
inhalation or dermal absorption of solvents in 
the rubber, paint (including paint applications) 
and parts-manufacturing industries. It also occurs during crude-oil refining and chemical 
manufacturing, a large component of which 
entails exposure to gasoline. Workers involved in the transport of crude oil and gasoline and 
in the dispensing of gasoline at service stations, as well as street workers, taxi drivers and others 
employed at workplaces with exposure to exhaust 
gases from motor vehicles also experience expo -
sure to benzene ( Nordlinder & Ramnäs, 1987 ).
CAREX (CARcinogen EXposure) is an inter -
national information system on occupational 
exposure to known and suspected carcinogens, based on data collected in the European Union 
(EU) from 1990 to 1993. The CAREX database 
provides selected exposure data and documented estimates of the number of exposed workers by 
country, carcinogen, and industry ( Kauppinen 
et al. , 2000 ). Table  1.1  presents the results for 
benzene in the EU by industry for the top-10 industries ( CAREX, 1999 ). Exposure to benzene 
is defined as inhalation or dermal exposure at 
work to benzene likely to exceed significantly 
non-occupational exposure due to inhaling 
urban air or filling in gasoline stations (long-term exposure usually below 0.01 ppm)].
From the US National Occupational Exposure 
Survey (1981–1983), it was estimated that approx -
imately 272300 workers (including 143000 
women) were potentially exposed to benzene in 
the United States of America. Industries where potential exposure occurred included agricul -
tural services, oil and gas extraction, construc -
tion (includes general building and special trades

van W ijngaarden & Stewart (2003) conducted 
a critical review of the literature on occupational exposures to benzene in the 1980s in the USA and 
Canada. The data indicated that workers in most industries experienced exposure levels below the 
regulatory limit (1 ppm) of the US Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), with a weighted arithmetic mean of 0.33 ppm across 
all industries. It was noted that little informa -
tion was available on exposure levels and their 
determinants for many industries with potential 
exposure.
Williams et al.  (2008)  summarized the values 
of the benzene content of selected petroleum-derived products based on published literature 
between 1956 and 2003. A total of 22 studies were identified, which contained 46 individual data 
sets and evaluated potential occupational expo -
sure to benzene in the USA during the handling 
or use of these petroleum-derived products. 
All mean (or median) airborne concentrations 
were less than 1 ppm, and most were <  0.1 ppm. Table 1.2 (available at http://monographs.
iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100F/100F-19-
Table1.2.pdf ) summarizes airborne benzene 
concentrations from studies and governmental 
reports published between 1981 and 2006.
Capleton & Levy (2005) tabulated typical 
benzene-exposure levels in different occupa -
tional groups in various areas in Europe and 
North America ( Table 1.3 ). The values are similar 
to those reported by van W ijngaarden & Stewart 
(2003)  and Williams et al.  (2008)  for exposures 
of 1 hour or more.
Williams et al.  (2005)  reviewed available indus -
trial-hygiene data describing exposure during the marine transport of benzene-containing products. Although there were differences in sampling strategies and in benzene content of the liquids being transported, typical benzene 
concentrations in air (personal time-weighted 
average) were in the range of 0.2–2.0 ppm during closed loading and 2–10 ppm during open 
loading-operations.
Liang et al.  (2005)  reviewed and tabulated 
benzene exposures by industry in the People’s Republic of China, using data published between 
1960 and 2003. The five industries with the highest reported exposures were those producing 
leather products, electronic devices, machinery, 
shoes, and office supplies and sports equipment. Median ambient concentrations in these indus -
tries were, respectively: 124.8 mg/m
3, 98.7 mg/m3, 
75.4 mg/m3, 50.4 mg/m3, and 50.3 mg/m3. [The 
Working Group noted that all data were 
collected with sampling methods of very short 
duration (1–20-minute time-weighted averages). In addition, a considerable part of the surveys 
were follow-up studies of benzene poisonings. 
Therefore, these data cannot be considered as representative and cannot be compared with the 
information reported from the USA.] Levels of 
short-term exposure to benzene varied consider -
ably between industries ( Table  1.4 ) and showed 
generally a downward trend over time (Fig. 1.1).
Urinary trans,trans -muconic acid ( t,t-MA) 
and S-phenylmercapturic acid ( S-PMA) are 
sensitive markers for recent exposure to benzene at low levels ( Qu et al. , 2005 ).
1.3.2  Non-occupational exposure
The major sources of benzene in the atmos -
phere are anthropogenic and include fixed indus -
trial sources, fuel evaporation from gasoline filling-stations and automobile exhaust. Benzene has been measured in outdoor air at various loca -
tions in the USA at concentrations ranging from 0.02 ppb (0.06 μg/m
3) in a rural area, to 112 ppb 
(356 μg/m3) in an urban area. Exposure to benzene 
is highest in areas of heavy motor-vehicle traffic 
and around gasoline filling-stations. Based on

an average benzene concentration of 12.5 ppb 
(40 μg/m3) in the air and an exposure of 1 hour 
per day, the daily intake of benzene from driving 
or riding in a motor vehicle is estimated to be 
40 μg. Exposure is higher for people who spend significant time in motor vehicles in areas of 
congested traffic ( NTP, 20 05 ; ATSDR, 2007 ).
The primary sources of exposure to benzene 
for the general population are ambient air containing tobacco smoke, air contaminated 
with benzene (for example, in areas with heavy traffic, around gasoline filling-stations), drinking 
contaminated water, or eating contaminated food. The median level of benzene was 2.2 ppb 
(7 μg/m3) in 185 homes without smokers and 
3.3 ppb (10.5 μg/m3) in 343 homes with one or 
more smokers. Amounts of benzene measured 
per cigarette ranged from 5.9 to 75 μg in main -
stream smoke and from 345 to 653 μg in side -
stream smoke. Benzene intake from ingestion of water and foods is very low, compared with 
intake from ambient air ( ATSDR, 1997 ; NTP, 
2005 ). Residential exposure to benzene can 
also occur from leaking underground gasoline-storage tanks. Benzene concentrations in homes from such exposures have been estimated to

Duarte-Davidson et al.  (2001)  assessed 
human exposure to benzene in the general popu -
lation of the United Kingdom. It was estimated 
that infants (< 1 year old), the average child (11 
years old), and non-occupationally exposed adults receive average daily doses of benzene 
in the range of 15–26 μg, 29–50 μg, and 75–522 
μg, respectively. These values correspond to average airborne benzene concentrations in the 
range of 3.40–5.76 μg/m
3, 3.37–5.67 μg/m3, and 
3.7–41 μg/m3 for these three groups, respectively.
Benzene concentrations in breath, blood and 
urine samples collected among the general popu -
lations (without occupational or known exposure 
to benzene) in Asia, Europe and North America are presented in Table 1.5 ( Johnson et al. , 2007 ).2. Cancer in Humans
In IARC Monographs  Volume 29 ( IARC, 
1982 ) the Working Group concluded there was 
sufficient evidence  in humans for the carcino -
genicity of benzene, noting that a series of cohort and case–control studies showed statistically 
significant associations between occupational 
exposure to benzene and benzene-containing solvents and leukaemia (predominantly 
myelogenous leukaemia). In IARC Monographs  
Supplement 7 ( IARC, 1987 ) benzene was classi -
fied as a Group-1 carcinogen, citing additional evidence of an increased incidence of acute 
nonlymphocytic leukaemia (ANLL) in workers exposed to benzene in three cohort studies, including an update of a cohort cited in Volume 
29 (IARC, 1982 ). Since 1987, there have been 
numerous reports from cohort studies in popu -
lations exposed to benzene, including updates of earlier reports, and new case–control studies 
of leukaemia or its subtypes, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), multiple myeloma, and to a

lesser extent other tumours in adults. There have 
also been several case–control studies of child -
hood leukaemia with data on benzene, solvents, gasoline, and other related exposures. In addi -
tion, several meta-analyses have been published 
of one or more tumour sites.
[The Working Group decided to restrict its 
review to those case–control studies of paedi -
atric cancers that included estimates of environ -
mental benzene exposure, rather than surrogate 
exposures such as proximity to petrol stations or 
traffic. Also, the Working Group weighed more 
heavily the findings from studies with estimates of occupational exposure to benzene rather 
than broader measures (e.g. to solvents) in case–
control studies. It was also decided not to rely in general on case–control studies where exposure 
assessment was limited to asking study subjects 
directly if they had been exposed to particular chemicals. Furthermore, the Working Group 
did not consider cohort studies of workers in 
synthetic rubber-manufacturing due to the diffi -
culty of separating out effects from benzene vs  
those of other chemicals that may cause haema -
tological malignancies. The Working Group decided not to take into consideration a series of 
meta-analyses of studies of petroleum workers 
(Wong & Raabe, 1995 , 1997 , 2000a , b). There 
were methodological concerns about the expan -
sion from paper to paper of additional studies, cohorts, and countries, and the overall approach may dilute out the risks associated with relatively 
highly exposed subgroups of these populations 
that in general were not identified. In addition, an increased risk of ANLL – or the alternative 
classification, Acute Myelogenous Leukaemia 
(AML), which is more restrictive but still consti -
tutes most of ANLL – was not detected in the 
initial meta-analysis by Wong & Raabe (1995) , 
this body of work was not considered relevant for 
assessing what additional cancers may be asso -
ciated with exposure to benzene beyond ANLL/AML. Abd finally, the Working Group noted that some meta-analyses of the same tumour came to opposite conclusions, which could be due to different inclusion/exclusion criteria, focusing on 
different subgroups of the study populations, or 
to different approaches to selecting risk estimates for inclusion (e.g. Lamm et al. , 2005 ; Steinmaus 
et al. , 2008 ), thus complicating the overall assess -
ment of the literature. The Working Group there -
fore decided not to rely in general on results of 
meta-analyses in its evaluations.]
2.1 Leukemias and lymphomas
2.1.1  Acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia/
acute myelogenous leukaemia
Since 1987, additional analyses of previ -
ously published cohort studies (e.g. results in 
Crump (1994)  and Wong (1995) , based on the 
cohort study described in Infante et al.  (1977)  
and Rinsky et al.  (1981 , 1987 ), which reported 
an excess risk for combined (mostly acute) 
myelogenous and monocytic leukaemia) and new cohort studies with quantitative data on 
benzene exposure have shown evidence of a 
dose–response relationship between exposure to benzene and risk for ANLL/AML in various 
industries and in several countries ( Hayes et al. , 
1997 ; Rushton & Romaniuk, 1997 ; Divine et al. , 
1999b ; Guénel et al. , 2002 ; Collins et al. , 2003 ; 
Glass et al. , 2003 ; Bloemen et al. , 2004 ; Gun et al. , 
2006 ; Kirkeleit et al. , 2008 ; see Table 2.1 available 
at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/
vol100F/100F-19-Table2.1.pdf ). It was also noted 
that the NCI-CAPM cohort study found evidence 
of an increased risk for the combined category of 
ANLL and myelodysplastic syndromes ( Hayes 
et al. , 1997 ). Case–control studies do not add 
substantively to these conclusions (see Table 2.2 available at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/
Monographs/vol100F/100F-19-Table2.2.pdf ). 
In one case–control study an increased risk for 
childhood ANLL was found for maternal self-
reported occupational exposure to benzene ( Shu 
et al. , 1988 ; see Table  2.1 online). One case–control 
258Benzene
study of childhood cancer in Denmark did not 
find an association of estimates of environmental 
benzene exposure from air pollution with an 
increased risk for ANLL ( Raaschou-Nielsen 
et al. , 2001 ).
2.1.2  Acute lymphocytic leukaemia
Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia (ALL) is 
now considered one subtype of NHL in the 
WHO-classification of lymphomas. In multiple 
cohorts there was a non-significantly increased risk for ALL, but the numbers of cases were small 
(Rushton, 1993 ; Wong et al. , 1993 ; Satin et al. , 
1996 ; Divine et al. , 1999b ; Lewis et al. , 2003 ; 
Kirkeleit et al. , 2008 ; Yin et al. , 1996 ; Guénel et al. , 
2002 ; Gun et al. , 2006 ; see Table 2.3 available at 
http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/
vol100F/100F-19-Table2.3.pdf ). [The Working 
Group noted that the magnitude of the risk-estimate in the NCI-CAPM cohort ( Yin et al. , 
1996 ) was similar to the risk observed for ANLL 
in the same study, which was statistically signifi -
cant. This approach has been suggested when attempting to interpret the association between 
occupational exposure to benzene and hemato -
logical subtypes that are less common than AML 
(Savitz & Andrews, 1997 ).]
In one case–control study in adults in 
Shanghai, a significant increased risk for ALL was found for the group with 15 or more years 
of self-reported occupational exposure to 
benzene ( Adegoke et al. , 2003 ); another study 
in the USA had only three exposed cases ( Blair 
et al. , 2001 ; Table  2.4 available at http://mono -
graphs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100F/100F-19-Table2.4.pdf ). In a case–control study of 
childhood ALL no association was found with maternal self-reported occupational exposure to benzene, but a borderline significant association 
was noted with exposure to gasoline ( Shu et al. , 
1988 ; see Table 2.4 online). No association with 
self-reported maternal exposure to benzene was found in a large study of childhood ALL in the USA ( Shu et al. , 1999 ; see Table 2.4 online). A case-
control study of childhood cancer in Denmark did not find an association of estimated environ -
mental exposure to benzene from air pollution 
with ALL ( Raaschou-Nielsen et al. , 2001 ).
2.1.3  Chronic myelogenous leukaemia
Several studies in the petroleum industry and 
in other settings show non-significantly increased 
risks for CML, whereas other studies show no 
evidence of an association, including two that had quantitative estimates of exposure to benzene 
but no dose–response relationship ( Rushton & 
Romaniuk, 1997 ; Guénel et al. , 2002 ; see Table 2.5 
available at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100F/100F-19-Table2.5.pdf ). 
Case–control studies have shown inconsistent 
results, with both increased risks (exposure for 
>  15 years was associated with an OR of 5.0 
(1.8–13.9; Adegoke et al. , 2003 ) and no increase 
in risk ( Björk et al. , 2001 ) reported (see Table 2.6 
available at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100F/100F-19-Table2.6.pdf ).
2.1.4  Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL) – 
also referred to as small lymphocytic lymphoma 
(SLL) – is now considered as a subtype of NHL in 
the WHO-classification of lymphomas. CLL can be an indolent disease of the elderly, which raises 
questions about cohorts that are not followed up 
until the study population is relatively old and about studies that use mortality instead of inci -
dent data. In addition, the diagnosis of CLL was less frequently made in the past, until complete blood counts were routinely obtained in recent 
decades.
Several cohort studies in the petroleum 
industry showed mixed results, with some non-significantly increased risks reported and other 
studies showing no association (see Table  2.7 available at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/
259IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
Monographs/vol100F/100F-19-Table2.7.pdf ). In 
a nested case–control study in the Australian 
petroleum industry an increasing risk for 
CLL was detected with increasing exposure to benzene over a relatively small range of ppm–
years, but the increase was not significant ( Glass 
et al. , 2003 ). Similarly, in a nested case–control 
study within a cohort of French gas and electrical utility workers, a non-significant increase in risk 
with increasing years of benzene exposure was detected ( Guénel et al. , 2002 ). Some evidence 
of risk with increasing benzene exposure was also found in a cohort study among petroleum workers in the United Kingdom, but the trends 
were not clear and interpretation is difficult as 
white- and blue-collar workers were mixed in the analysis and interactions may have been 
present ( Rushton & Romaniuk, 1997 ). Updates 
of two cohort studies in the Southern US found 
an increased risk for CLL, which was significant 
in one cohort for workers hired before 1950, but 
not in the other ( Huebner et al. , 2004 ).
A case–control study in Italy showed evidence 
of a dose–response relationship between the extent of benzene exposure with the number of years worked with benzene ( Costantini et al. , 
2008 ) and in a large multicentre international 
study in Europe a significant excess in risk for CLL was found with increasing exposure to 
benzene, but the dose–response was not signifi -
cant ( Cocco et al. , 2010 ; see Table 2.8 available 
at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/
vol100F/100F-19-Table2.8.pdf ). Blair et al.  (2001)  
conducted a study in the Midwestern USA and 
found no association with benzene exposure 
although there were only three cases in the 
high-exposure category. In a study of women in Connecticut, a non-significantly increased risk 
for CLL was found with increasing exposure to 
benzene ( Wang et al. , 2009 ; see Table 2.8 online).2.1.5  Non-Hodgkin lymphoma
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a hetero -
geneous group of histological subtypes, and 
the definition of both NHL and its subtypes 
has evolved over the last several decades with the application and discontinuation of several 
classification schemes, which complicates the 
assessment of exposure to benzene and risk for NHL. For example, CLL – now classified by 
the WHO as a subtype of NHL – has generally 
not been combined with other types of NHL in reports from cohort studies of benzene-exposed 
workers or in earlier case–control studies of 
NHL. Further, given the indolent nature of some NHL subtypes, cohorts with only mortality data 
may underestimate associations with NHL. In 
most cohort studies an increased risk for NHL was not detected, one particular exception being 
the NCI-CAPM cohort study in China ( Hayes 
et al. , 1997 ; Table  2.9 available at http://mono -
graphs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100F/100F-19-Table2.9.pdf ). An excess of NHL was not 
detected in the Pilofilm cohort ( Rinsky et al. , 
2002 ) or in the Australian Health Watch study 
in an analysis of NHL combined with multiple 
myeloma (two-thirds of which were NHL cases) (Glass et al. , 2003 ).
Of 14 independent case–control studies 
that were considered informative, five showed evidence of increased risk with benzene expo -
sure, two ( Fabbro-Peray et al. , 2001 ; Dryver et al. , 
2004 ) for NHL as a whole (Table 2.10 available 
at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/
vol100F/100F-19-Table2.10.pdf ). Data on histo -
logical subtypes of NHL have generally not been reported in publications of occupational 
cohort studies of benzene-exposed workers, but 
they have been mentioned in some case–control studies. For various benzene-exposure metrics, 
slightly increased, but non-significant risks for 
NHL were found in a case–control study among women in Connecticut, as well as higher risks 
– also non-significant – for follicular lymphoma 
260Benzene
and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 
two common NHL subtypes ( Wang et al. , 2009 ). 
Cocco et al.  (2010)  conducted an analysis of a 
large multicentre case–control study of NHL in Europe and found no significant increase in risk 
for B-cell NHL or DLBCL, but an elevated risk, 
albeit not statistically significant, for follicular lymphoma associated with exposure to benzene 
(see Table  2.10 online), and a significant asso -
ciation between combined exposure to benzene/
toluene/xylene and follicular lymphoma. Other 
case–control studies showed increased, non-
significant risks for one or both of these histo -
logical subtypes, and in one study in Italy a 
significant association was found between 
medium/high exposure to benzene and the risk for diffuse lymphoma ( Miligi et al. , 2006 ; 
OR = 2.4, 95%CI: 1.3–1.5).
2.1.6  Multiple myeloma
Most cohort studies showed no associa -
tion with multiple myeloma (MM) (Table  2.11 
available at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/
Monographs/vol100F/100F-19-Table2.11.pdf ). 
However, there was a statistically significant 
excess of MM reported for the Pliofilm cohort 
(SMR 4.1; 95%CI: 1.1–10.5, based upon four deaths) ( Rinsky et al. , 1987 ), which did not 
persist in the most recent update ( Rinsky et al. , 
2002 ; see Table  2.11 online). In a cohort study 
among chemical workers at the Monsanto chem -
ical company suggestive evidence was found of a dose–response relationship ( Collins et al. , 2003 ), 
while in a cohort study of Norwegian workers in 
the upstream petroleum industry (i.e. the phases 
of oil extraction and initial transportion, which entail extensive exposure to crude oil) a signifi -
cant increased risk for MM was found ( Kirkeleit 
et al. , 2008 ).
Case–control studies of MM with estimates of 
exposure to benzene largely show no association (Table 2.12 available at http://monographs.iarc.fr/
ENG/Monographs/vol100F/100F-19-Table2.12.pdf). An exception was an early study in which 
a significant association was found between risk 
for MM and the proportion of cases and controls 
with “solvent/benzene” exposure ( La Vecchia 
et al. , 1989 ). In another study, borderline signifi -
cant effects were detected ( Costantini et al. , 
2008 ). In a large multicentre case–control study 
of NHL in Europe there was no association of 
benzene exposure with MM ( Cocco et al. , 2010 ).
A meta-analysis by Infante (2006)  analysed 
data from seven well defined “benzene cohorts” outside of petroleum refining and found a statis -
tically significant increase in risk for MM (RR 
2.1; 95%CI: 1.3–3.5).
2.1.7  Hodgkin disease
There are sparse data on Hodgkin disease in 
studies of benzene-exposed cohorts, with most 
studies having very small numbers of cases and 
showing no association (see Table 2.13 available at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/
vol100F/100F-19-Table2.13.pdf ). Overall, there 
is no evidence of an increased risk. The rela -
tively few case–control studies in adults also 
show no association (see Table 2.14 available at 
http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100F/100F-19-Table2.14.pdf ). In a case–
control study of childhood cancer in Denmark, an increased risk for Hodgkin disease was detected in association with estimated environ -
mental exposures to benzene ( Raaschou-Nielsen 
et al.  (2001)  (see Table 2.14 online).
2.2 Cancer of the lung
Cohort studies with information on potential 
or estimated benzene exposure and lung cancer 
are shown in Table 2.15 (available at http://mono -
graphs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100F/100F-
19-Table2.15.pdf ). Although most studies show 
no association, in two cohorts with quantitative exposure-assessment evidence of a dose–response relationship was found ( Hayes et al. , 1996 ; Collins 
261IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
et al. , 2003 ) and in two others statistically signifi -
cant increases in risk were observed ( Lynge et al. , 
1997 ; Sorahan et al. , 2005 ). A case–control study 
from Canada showed no association of exposure 
to benzene with lung cancer overall or with the 
major histological subtypes ( Gérin et al. , 1998 ; 
see Table  2.16 available at http://monographs.
iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100F/100F-19-
Table2.16.pdf ).
2.3 Cancer of the kidney
Cohort studies with results on kidney cancer 
are shown in Table 2.17 (available at http://mono -
graphs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100F/100F-
19-Table2.17.pdf ). Results generally do not show 
any association. In a case–control study among 
males in Germany an association was found 
between exposure to benzene and an increased risk for kidney cancer ( Pesch et al. , 2000 ), but 
in a study in Montreal, Canada, there was little evidence of an association ( Gérin et al. , 1998 ) (see 
Table 2.18 available at http://monographs.iarc.fr/
ENG/Monographs/vol100F/100F-19-Table2.18.
pdf).
2.4 Other cancers
In the evaluation of the cohort studies that 
provided data on the cancer sites considered 
above, it was apparent that associations have 
occasionally been found with other cancer sites including malignant melanoma ( Schnatter 
et al. , 1996 ; Consonni et al. , 1999 ; Lewis et al. , 
2003 ), nose and stomach cancer ( Fu et al. , 1996 ) 
and prostate cancer ( Collingwood et al. , 1996 ), 
but overall there was no consistency across the cohorts.3. Cancer in Experimental Animals
Studies on the carcinogenesis of benzene in 
rats and mice after exposure by inhalation, intra -
gastric gavage, skin application, and by intra -
peritoneal or subcutaneous injection have been reviewed in IARC Monographs  Volume 29 and in 
Supplement 7 ( IARC, 1982 , 1987 ). In Supplement 
7 it was concluded that there is sufficient evidence  
in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity 
of benzene. Results of adequately conducted 
carcinogenicity studies reported before and after 1987 are summarized in Tables 3.1 , 3.2, 3.3, 3.4.
Exposure to benzene by inhalation increased 
the incidence of Zymbal gland carcinomas, liver adenomas, and forestomach and oral cavity 
carcinomas in female rats ( Maltoni et al. , 1982a , 
c, 1983 , 1985 , 1989 ). It also increased the inci -
dence of lymphohaematopoietic (lymphoma, myelogenous) neoplasms in male and female 
mice ( Snyder et al. , 1980 ; Cronkite et al. , 1984 , 
1989 ; Farris et al. , 1993 ), and Zymbal gland carci -
nomas, squamous cell carcinomas of the prepu -
tial gland, and lung adenomas in male mice (Snyder et al. , 1988 ; Farris et al. , 1993 ).
Oral administration of benzene increased 
the incidence of Zymbal gland carcinomas and oral-cavity papillomas and carcinomas in rats of 
both sexes, of carcinomas of the tongue, papil -
lomas and carcinomas of the skin and of the 
lip and papillomas of the palate in male rats, of 
forestomach acanthomas in both sexes of the rat, 
and of forestomach carcinomas in female rats (Maltoni & Scarnato, 1979 ; Maltoni et al. ,1982b , 
1983 , 1988 , 1989 ; NTP, 1986 ; Maronpot, 1987 ; 
Huff et al. , 1989 ; Mehlman, 2002 ). Given by 
the oral route, benzene also increased the inci -
dence of Zymbal gland carcinomas, forestomach papillomas, lymphomas, and lung adenomas and carcinomas in mice of both sexes, of liver 
carcinomas, adrenal gland pheochromocy -
tomas, harderian gland adenomas and preputial 
gland squamous cell carcinomas in male mice,

tion, skin application, or inhalation resulted in 
increased incidences of skin tumours ( Blanchard

(French & Saulnier, 2000 ; NTP, 20 07 ; Kawasaki

4. Other Relevant Data
4.1 Genetic and related effects
Benzene induced chromosomal aberrations, 
micronuclei and sister chromatid exchange in 
bone-marrow cells of mice, chromosomal aber -
rations in bone-marrow cells of rats and Chinese 
hamsters and sperm-head anomalies in mice 
treated in vivo . It induced chromosomal aber -
rations and mutation in human cells in vitro  
but did not induce sister chromatid exchange in cultured human lymphocytes, except in one 
study in which high concentrations of an exog -
enous metabolic system were used. In some test 
systems, benzene induced cell transformation. 
It did not induce sister chromatid exchange in rodent cells in vitro , but it did induce aneuploidy 
and, in some studies, chromosomal aberrations in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells. Benzene induced mutation and DNA damage in some 
studies in rodent cells in vitro . In Drosophila , 
benzene was reported to be weakly positive in 
assays for somatic mutation and for crossing-
over in spermatogonia; in single studies, it did not induce sex-linked recessive lethal mutations 
or translocations. It induced aneuploidy, muta -
tion and gene conversion in fungi. Benzene was not mutagenic to bacteria ( IARC, 1982 , 1987 ). 
Chromosomal aberrations in human peripheral 
lymphocytes have been associated with occupa -
tional exposure to benzene for decades ( Forni, 
1979 ; IARC, 1982 ; Eastmond, 1993 ; Zhang et al ., 
2002 ; Holecková et al., 2004 ).
4.2 Leukaemogenic potential of 
benzene
Benzene is carcinogenic to the bone 
marrow causing leukaemia and myelodys -
plastic syndromes (MDS) and probably also to 
the lymphatic system causing non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Its carcinogenic mechanism of 
action is likely to be different for these two 
target tissues and probably multifactorial in nature. The metabolism of benzene will be 
summarized below and a review is presented of 
the current state of knowledge on the mecha -
nisms of leukaemia and lymphoma induction 
by benzene. With regard to leukaemia, prob -
able mechanisms of leukaemogenesis in the 
myeloid series, mainly acute myeloid leukaemia 
(AML) and MDS are discussed. Then, potential 
mechanisms by which benzene could cause acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) in both adults 
and children are reviewed. Finally, mechanisms 
for the benzene-induced development of non-Hodgkin lymphoma are summarized, including 
that of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), as 
it is now classified as a form of lymphoma.
4.2.1 Metabolism of benzene and its 
relevance to carcinogenicity
Benzene must be metabolized to become 
carcinogenic ( Ross, 2000 ; Snyder, 2004 ). Its 
metabolism is summarized in Fig.  4.1. The 
initial metabolic step involves cytochrome P450 (CYP)-dependent oxidation to benzene oxide, 
276Benzene
which exists in equilibrium with its tautomer 
oxepin. Most benzene oxide spontaneously 
rearranges to phenol, which is either excreted 
or further metabolized to hydroquinone and 1,4-benzoquinone. The remaining benzene 
oxide is either hydrolysed to produce benzene 
1,2-dihydrodiol (catechol), which is further oxidized to 1,2-benzoquinone, or it reacts with 
glutathione to produce S -phenylmercapturic 
acid. Metabolism of oxepin is thought to open 
the aromatic ring, to yield the reactive muconal -
dehydes and E,E -muconic acid. Human exposure 
to benzene at concentrations in air between 0.1 and 10 ppm, results in urinary metabolite profiles 
with 70–85% phenol, 5–10% each of hydroqui -
none, E,E-muconic acid and catechol, and less 
than 1% of S -phenylmercapturic acid ( Kim 
et al. , 2006b ). Benzene oxide, the benzoquinones, 
muconaldehydes, and benzene dihydrodiol 
epoxides (formed from CYP-mediated oxidation 
of benzene dihydrodiol) are electrophiles that 
readily react with peptides, proteins and DNA (Bechtold et al. , 1992 ; McDonald et al. , 1993 ; 
Bodell et al. , 1996 ; Gaskell et al. , 2005 ; Henderson 
et al. , 2005 ; Waidyanatha & Rappaport, 2005 ) 
and can thereby interfere with cellular function 
(Smith, 1996 ). It remains unclear what role these 
different metabolites play in the carcinogenicity 
of benzene, but benzoquinone formation from 
hydroquinone via myeloperoxidase in the bone 
marrow has been suggested as being a key step (Smith, 1996 ). There is considerable evidence 
for an important role of this metabolic pathway that leads to benzoquinone formation, as the benzoquinone-detoxifying enzyme NAD(P)
H:quinone oxidoreductase1 (NQO1) protects 
mice against benzene-induced myelodysplasia (Long et al. , 2002 ; Iskander & Jaiswal, 2005 ) and 
humans against the hematotoxicity of benzene (Rothman et al. , 1997 ). However, this does not 
rule out adverse effects from other metabolites.
Increased susceptibility to the toxic effects 
of benzene has been linked to genetic polymor -
phisms that increase the rate of metabolism of benzene to active intermediates, or decrease the rate of detoxification of these active intermedi -
ates ( Rothman et al. , 1997 ; Xu et al. , 1998 ; Kim 
et al. , 2004 ).
Recently it has been shown that benzene 
is most likely metabolized initially to phenol and E,E-muconic acid via two enzymes rather 
than just one CYP enzyme, and that the puta -
tive, high-affinity enzyme is active primarily at benzene concentrations below 1 ppm ( Rappaport 
et al. , 2009 ). CYP2E1 is the primary enzyme 
responsible for mammalian metabolism of benzene at higher levels of exposure ( Valentine 
et al. , 1996 ; Nedelcheva et al. , 1999 ). CYP2F1 and 
CYP2A13 are reasonable candidate enzymes that are active at environmental levels of exposure below 1 ppm ( Powley & Carlson, 2000 ; Sheets 
et al. , 2004 ; Rappaport et al. , 2009 ). These CYPs 
are highly expressed in the human lung. Despite much research, more work is needed to elucidate 
the different roles of multiple metabolites in the 
toxicity of benzene and the pathways that lead to their formation.
A role for the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor 
(AhR) is also emerging in the haematotox -
icity of benzene. AhR is known mainly as the 
mediator for the toxicity of certain xenobiotics 
(Hirabayashi & Inoue, 2009 ). However, this tran -
scription factor has many important biological 
functions and evidence is emerging that it has a 
significant role in the regulation of haematopoi -
etic stem cells ( Hirabayashi & Inoue, 2009 ; Singh 
et al. , 2009 ). It has been hypothesized that AhR 
expression is necessary for the proper mainte -
nance of quiescence in these cells, and that AhR 
downregulation is essential for their “escape” 
from quiescence and subsequent proliferation (Singh et al. , 2009 ). It has been demonstrated that 
AhR-knockout (KO) ( AhR
−/−) mice do not show 
any haematotoxicity after exposure to benzene 
(Yoon et al. , 2002 ). Follow-up studies have shown 
that mice that had been lethally irradiated and 
repopulated with marrow cells from AhR-KO 
mice did not display any sign of benzene-induced 
277IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
haematotoxicity ( Hirabayashi et al. , 2008 ). The 
most likely explanation for these findings is that 
the absence of AhR removes haematopoietic stem 
cells from their quiescent state and makes them susceptible to DNA damage from benzene expo -
sure and subsequent cell death through apop -
tosis. Further research is needed to examine the effects of benzene and its metabolites on cycling and quiescent haematopoietic stem cells.4.2.2  Mechanisms of myeloid leukaemia 
development
(a) General
AML and MDS are closely-related diseases 
of the bone marrow that arise de novo (without 
an obvious cause) in the general population or following therapy with alkylating agents, topo-
isomerase II inhibitors, or ionizing radiation 
(therapy-related AML and MDS, i.e. t-AML and t-MDS) ( Pedersen-Bjergaard et al. , 2006 , 2008 ). 
Occupational exposure to benzene is widely thought to cause leukaemias that are similar to various forms of t-AML and t-MDS ( Irons 
278Fig. 4.1 Simplified metabolic scheme for benzene showing major pathways and metabolizing  
enzymes leading to toxicity. CYP2E1, cytochrome P450 2E1; GST, glutathione- S-transferase; 
NQO1, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1; MPO, myeloperoxidase; UDPGT, Uridine diphosphate 
glucoronosyl transferase; PST, phenol sulphotransferase; mEH, microsomal epoxide hydrolaseBenzene
& Stillman, 1996 ; Larson & Le Beau, 2005 ; 
Zhang et al. , 2007 ). AML and MDS both arise 
from genetically altered CD34+ stem cells or 
progenitor cells in the bone marrow ( Morgan 
& Alvares, 2005 ; Passegué & Weisman, 2005 ) 
and are characterized by many different types of recurrent chromosome aberrations ( Pedersen-
Bjergaard et al. , 2006 ; Mrózek & Bloomfield, 
2008 ). These aberrations have been shown to 
often develop into the genetic mutations that produce leukaemia. Cytogenetic analysis of 
chromosome number and structure has therefore 
become important in diagnosis and treatment of MDS and AML ( Pedersen-Bjergaard et al. , 2006 ; 
Mrózek & Bloomfield, 2008 ). Recent research 
has shown that the chromosome aberrations and gene mutations detected in therapy-related and 
de novo MDS and AML are identical, although 
the frequencies with which they are observed in different subtypes may differ ( Pedersen-Bjergaard 
et al. , 2008 ). Hence, therapy-related and de novo 
MDS and AML are considered identical diseases (Pedersen-Bjergaard et al. , 2008 ).
At least three cytogenetic categories of AML 
and MDS are commonly observed: those with unbalanced aberrations, with balanced rear -
rangements, and with normal karyotype:
Unbalanced chromosome aberrations 
comprise primarily the loss of various parts of 
the long arm or loss of the whole chromosome 5 
or 7 (5q–/–5 or 7q–/–7) and gain of a whole chro -
mosome 8 (+8) ( Pedersen-Bjergaard et al. , 2006 , 
2007 , 2008 ). These cases often have a complex 
karyotype and carry point mutations of TP53  or 
AML1 . Unbalanced chromosome aberrations are 
common after therapy with alkylating agents.
Balanced rearrangements are recurrent 
balanced translocations [e.g. t(11q23), t(8;21) and 
t(15;17)] or inversions [e.g. inv(16)], which arise, 
at least in the therapy-related subset of cases, as illegitimate gene recombinations related to func -
tional inhibition of topoisomerase II ( Pedersen-
Bjergaard et al. , 2006 , 2008 ). Among the most 
important rearranged transcription-factor genes are the mixed-lineage leukaemia ( MLL ) at 11q23, 
the AML1  at 21q22, the retinoic-acid receptor-α 
RARA  at 17q21 and the core-binding factor 
subunit-β ( CBFB ) at 16q22 ( Pedersen-Bjergaard 
et al. , 2007 ).
Cases with a normal karyotype often harbour 
mutations of the NPM1  gene (which encodes 
nucleophosmin), internal tandem duplications of 
the FLT3  gene (which encodes fms-related tyro -
sine kinase), and/or point mutations or an altered 
methylation status of the C/EBPα  gene (which 
encodes CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α) (Cuneo et al. , 2002 ; Pedersen-Bjergaard et al. , 
2006 , 2007 , 2008 ; Hackanson et al. , 2008 ).
Within these three cytogenetic categories 
there are at least eight different genetic path -
ways that lead to MDS and AML, as defined by 
the specific chromosome aberrations present 
in each (Pathways I –VIII in Fig. 4.2). As more becomes clear about the molecular cytogenetics 
of leukaemia, it seems likely that many other 
pathways to AML and MDS will be discovered. For example, recent unbiased high-resolution 
genomic screens have identified many genes not 
previously implicated in AML that may be rele -
vant for pathogenesis, along with many known 
oncogenes and tumour-suppressor genes ( Ley 
et al. , 2008 ; Mardis et al. , 2009 ; Walter et al. , 
2009 ).
Another classical pathway to AML is 
through the transformation of a myeloprolifera -
tive disorder (MPD) ( Abdulkarim et al. , 2009 ), 
although there is less evidence for this pathway 
as a relevant mechanism to benzene-induced AML. MPDs include Philadelphia chromosome 
(Ph)-positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia 
(CML) and the Ph-negative conditions poly -
cythemia vera , essential trombocythemia and 
idiopathic myelofibrosis. It is well established that AML may occur as a late complication in all these disorders. Over the first ten years after 
diagnosis, the incidence of leukaemic transfor -
mation is reported to be higher in patients with 
idiopathic myelofibrosis (8–23%) compared with 
279IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
280Fig. 4.2 Genetic Pathways to Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) and Acute Myeloid Leukaemia
From Pedersen-Bjergaard et al . (2006)Benzene
patients with essential trombocythemia (0.5–1%) 
and polycythemia vera (1–4%) ( Abdulkarim et al. , 
2009 ). Thus, benzene may first produce an MPD, 
which later transforms into AML.
An important role for epigenetic changes 
is also emerging in association with the devel -
opment of leukaemia. Functional loss of the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α ( C/EBPα ) 
(also known as CEBPA), a central regulatory transcription factor in the haematopoietic system, can result in a differentiation block in 
granulopoiesis and thus contribute to leukaemic 
transformation ( Fröhling & Döhner, 2004 ). 
Recent work has shown that epigenetic altera -
tions of C/EBPα  occur frequently in AML and 
that C/EBPα  mRNA is a target for miRNA-
124a ( Hackanson et al. , 2008 ). This miRNA is 
frequently silenced by epigenetic mechanisms in leukaemia cell lines. C/EBPα  is also capable of 
controlling miRNA-223  expression, which is vital 
in granulocytic differentiation ( Fazi et al. , 2005 ). 
Altered expression of several miRNAs is also observed in some forms of AML ( Dixon-McIver 
et al. , 2008 ; Marcucci et al. , 2008 ).
(b) Mechanisms of benzene-induced myeloid leukaemia development
There is strong evidence that benzene can 
induce AML via pathways I, II and IV, consid -
erable supporting evidence for pathway V, some 
evidence for pathway III, but little informa -
tion regarding pathways VI–VIII (see Fig.  4.2). 
Exposure to benzene has been associated with 
higher levels of the chromosomal changes 
commonly observed in AML, including 5q–/–5 or 7q–/–7, +8, and t(8;21) in the blood cells of highly 
exposed workers ( Smith et al. , 1998 ; Zhang et al. , 
1999 , 2002 ). The benzene metabolite hydroqui -
none produces these same changes in cultured human cells, including cultures of CD34+ 
progenitor cells ( Smith et al. , 2000 ; Stillman 
et al. , 2000 ). This provides strong evidence for 
the induction by benzene of AML via pathways I, II and IV (see Fig. 4.2).Pathways III, IV and V are related to the 
inhibition of the DNA-related enzyme topo-
isomerase II, which is essential for the main -
tenance of proper chromosome structure and 
segregation; it removes knots and tangles from 
the genetic material by passing an intact double 
helix through a transient double-stranded break that it creates in a separate segment of 
DNA ( McClendon & Osheroff, 2007 ; Bandele 
& Osheroff, 2009 ). To maintain genomic integ -
rity during its catalytic cycle, topoisomerase II forms covalent bonds between active-site 
tyrosyl residues and the 5 ′-DNA termini created 
by cleavage of the double helix ( Bandele & 
Osheroff, 2009 ). Normally, these covalent topoi -
somerase II-cleaved DNA complexes (known as cleavable complexes) are fleeting interme -
diates and are tolerated by the cell. However, when the concentration or longevity of cleavage complexes increases significantly, DNA double-
strand breaks occur ( Lindsey et al. , 2004 ). If 
topoisomerase II–induced double-strand breaks 
are incorrectly repaired, two unrelated (nonho -
mologous) chromosomes are fused together to produce translocations or inversions ( Deweese 
& Osheroff, 2009 ).
There are different types of topoisomerase-II 
inhibitors. Epidophyllotoxins, such as etoposide, cause chromosome damage and kill cells by 
increasing physiological levels of topoisomerase 
II-DNA cleavage complexes ( Baker et al. , 2001 ; 
Felix, 2001 ; Deweese & Osheroff, 2009 ). These 
drugs are referred to as topoisomerase-II poisons to distinguish them from catalytic inhibitors of the enzyme because they convert this essential 
enzyme to a potent cellular toxin. Other drugs, 
such as merbarone, act as inhibitors of topo-II activity but, in contrast to etoposide they do 
not stabilize topoisomerase II-DNA cleavable 
complexes. Nevertheless, they are potent clas -
togens both in vitro and in vivo ( Wang et al. , 
2007 ).
Several studies have shown that benzene in 
vivo, and its reactive metabolites hydroquinone 
281IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
and 1,4-benzoquinone in vitro, inhibit the func -
tionality of topoisomerase II and enhance DNA 
cleavage ( Chen & Eastmond, 1995 ; Frantz et al. , 
1996 ; Hutt & Kalf, 1996 ; Eastmond et al. , 2001 ; 
Fung et al. , 2004 ; Lindsey et al. , 2004 , 2005 ; 
Whysner et al. , 2004 ). Bioactivation of hydro -
quinone by myeloperoxydase to 1,4-benzoqui -
none enhances topoisomerase-II inhibition (Eastmond et al. , 2005 ). Indeed, 1,4-benzo -
quinone was shown to be a more potent topo-
isomerase-II inhibitor than hydroquinone in a 
cell-free assay system ( Hutt & Kalf, 1996 ; Baker 
et al. , 2001 ). These findings demonstrate that 
benzene through its reactive quinone metabo -
lites can inhibit topoisomerase II and probably 
cause leukaemias with chromosome transloca -
tions and inversions known to be generated by 
topoisomerase-II inhibitors, including AMLs 
harbouring t(21q22), t(15;17) and inv(16) in a manner consistent with pathways IV and V 
(Andersen et al. , 2002 ; Voltz et al.  2004 ; Mistry 
et al. , 2005 ; Pedersen-Bjergaard et al. , 2007 , 2008 ). 
The evidence for rearrangements of the mixed lineage leukaemia ( MLL ) gene through t(11q23) 
via pathway III in benzene-induced leukaemia is 
less convincing but may occur through an apop -
totic pathway ( Vaughan et al. , 2005 ).
AML can arise de novo via pathways VII and 
VIII without apparent chromosome abnormali -
ties, but molecular analysis has revealed many genetic changes in these apparently normal leukemias, including mutations of NPM1, AML1, 
FLT3, RAS  and C/EBPα . (Fig. 4.2; Cuneo et al. , 
2002 ; Falini et al. , 2007 ; Mardis et al. , 2009 ). More 
work is needed to clarify the ability of benzene and its metabolites to produce mutations of the 
type found in these leukaemias, along with those found in Ph-negative MPDs such as Janus kinase 
2 (JAK2 ), and somatic mutations in the ten-
eleven translocation 2 ( TET2 ) oncogene, which 
are found in about 15% of patients with various myeloid cancers ( Delhommeau et al. , 2009 ). One 
potential mechanism for the induction of such mutations is through the generation of reactive 
oxygen species.
The ability of benzene and/or its metabolites 
to induce epigenetic changes related to the devel -
opment of leukaemia, such as altered methylation 
status of C/EBPα,  is unclear at this time. Bollati et 
al. (2007)  reported that hypermethylation in p15  
(+0.35%; P = 0.018) and hypomethylation in the 
MAGE-1  gene (encoding the human melanoma 
antigen) (−0.49%; P   =  0.049) were associated 
with very low exposures to benzene (~22 ppb) in healthy subjects including gas-station attend -
ants and traffic-police officers, although the 
corresponding effects on methylation were very 
low. Further study of the role epigenetics in the 
haematotoxicity and carcinogenicity of benzene is warranted, including studies of aberrant DNA 
methylation and altered microRNA expression.
While benzene and its metabolites are clearly 
capable of producing multiple forms of chro -
mosomal mutation, including various translo -
cations, deletions and aneuploidies, these are 
usually insufficient as a single event to explain 
the induction of leukaemia ( Guo et al. , 2008 ; 
Lobato et al. , 2008 ). Other secondary events, 
such as specific gene mutations and/or other chromosome changes, are usually required ( Guo 
et al. , 2008 ; Lobato et al. , 2008 ). Thus, benzene-
induced leukaemia probably begins as a muta -
genic event in the stem cell or progenitor cell 
and subsequent genomic instability allows for sufficient mutations to be acquired in a relatively 
short time. Studies have shown that the benzene 
metabolite hydroquinone is similar to ionizing radiation in that it induces genomic instability 
in the bone marrow of susceptible mice ( Gowans 
et al. , 2005 ). Recent findings showing the impor -
tance of genes involved in DNA repair and maintenance – such as the WRN  gene encoding 
the Werner syndrome protein – in determining 
genetic susceptibility to the toxicity of benzene 
also support this mechanism ( Shen et al. , 2006 ; 
Lan et al. , 2009 ; Ren et al. , 2009 ).
282Benzene
Haematotoxic effects may also contribute to 
leukaemogenesis from benzene. Haematopoietic 
stem cells occupy an ordered environment in the 
bone marrow and interact with supportive stromal cells and mature lymphocytes. Haematotoxic 
damage to this ordered stem-cell microenviron -
ment most likely allows for the clonal expansion 
of the leukaemic stem cells. This dual mode of 
action for benzene fits with the known ability 
of benzene metabolites to induce chromosomal mutations and genomic instability in blood stem 
cells and progenitor cells, and with the fact that 
haematotoxicity is associated with an increased risk for benzene-induced haematopoietic malig -
nancies (Rothman et al. , 1997 ).
Thus, exposure to benzene can lead to multiple 
alterations that contribute to the leukaemogenic 
process. Benzene may act by causing chromo -
somal damage (aneuploidy, deletions and trans -
locations) through inhibition of topoisomerase II, disruption of microtubules and other mecha -
nisms; by generating oxygen radicals that lead 
to point mutations, strand breaks and oxidative 
stress; by causing immune system dysfunction 
that leads to decreased immunosurveillance (Cho, 2008 ; Li et al. , 2009 ); by altering stem-cell 
pool sizes through haematotoxic effects ( Irons 
et al. , 1992 ); by inhibiting gap-junction intercel -
lular communication ( Rivedal & Witz, 2005 ); 
and by altering DNA methylation and perhaps specific microRNAs. This multimodal mecha -
nism of action for benzene suggests that the 
effects of benzene on the leukaemogenic process 
are not singular and can occur throughout the process.
4.2.3  Potential mechanisms of benzene-
induced acute lymphocytic leukaemia 
(ALL) development
Evidence of an association between exposure 
to benzene from air pollution and childhood 
leukaemia is growing. The most common form 
of childhood leukaemia is ALL, with AML being less common at around 15% of the incidence of ALL. The opposite is true for adults where the 
ratio is reversed, with AML being predominant. 
Reasons for this difference were suggested to be age-related defects in lymphopoiesis ( Signer 
et al. , 2007 ). Studies with a murine model of 
chronic myeloid leukaemia – an adult-onset malignancy that arises from transformation 
of haematopoietic stem cells by the breakpoint 
cluster region-Ableson ( BCR-ABL
P210) onco -
gene – demonstrated that young bone-marrow 
cells transformed with BCR-ABLP210 initiated 
both MPD and B-lymphoid leukaemia, whereas BCR-ABL
P210-transformed old bone-marrow cells 
recapitulated the human disease by inducing MPD with rare lymphoid involvement ( Signer 
et al. , 2007 ). Thus, if benzene were to induce a 
leukaemia-related oncogenic mutation in young bone-marrow cells, it could produce either an 
MPD that transformed to AML, or a B-cell ALL, whereas exposure in an adult would have only a 
very limited chance of producing ALL.
The long-standing distinction between AML 
and ALL also has become somewhat blurred in recent years. Both forms of leukaemia arise 
in pluripotential stem cells or early progenitor cells in the bone marrow. Either disease can 
occur under conditions that formerly seemed 
restricted to AML. These include ALL occurring in the acute leukaemia seen in Down Syndrome 
(Kearney et al. , 2009 ); in secondary leukaemias 
related to chemotherapy ( Lee et al. , 2009 ); and in 
the blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (Calabretta & Perrotti, 2004 ). Similarly, the 
Philadelphia chromosome, long considered to 
be specific to chronic myelogenous leukaemia, is 
also the most common chromosome rearrange -
ment in adult ALL ( Ravandi & Kebriaei, 2009 ).
Since the genotoxic action of benzene metab -
olites on pluripotent precursor cells in the bone 
marrow appears promiscuous, producing multiple genetic abnormalities, it seems probable that 
exposure to benzene can initiate both AML and 
ALL by causing the chromosomal rearrangements 
283IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
and mutations that are on the causal pathway 
to these malignancies. For childhood ALL and 
AML it has been shown that the disease is usually 
initiated in utero , since leukaemic translocations 
and other genetic changes have been detected 
in blood spots collected at birth ( Wiemels et al. , 
1999 ; Wiemels et al. , 2002 ; Greaves & Wiemels, 
2003 ; McHale et al. , 2003 ). Thus, exposure of the 
mother, and perhaps even the father, to benzene 
could be just as important as exposure of the child in producing childhood AML and ALL, 
as has been suggested in several epidemiological 
studies ( van S teensel-Moll et al. , 1985 ; McKinney 
et al. , 1991 ; Shu et al. , 1999 ; Scélo et al. , 2009 ). 
Supporting this hypothesis is an animal study demonstrating that in utero  exposure to benzene 
increases the frequency of micronuclei and DNA 
recombination events in haematopoietic tissue 
of fetal and post-natal mice ( Lau et al. , 2009 ). 
Another study showed that oxygen radicals play 
a key role in the development of in utero -initiated 
benzene toxicity through disruption of haema -
topoietic cell-signalling pathways ( Badham & 
Winn, 2010 ). These studies support the idea that 
genotoxic and non-genotoxic events following 
exposure to benzene may be initiators of child -
hood leukaemia in utero .
4.2.4  Mechanisms of lymphoma 
development
(a) General
Lymphoma is a cancer of the immune system 
that includes over 40 malignant diseases origi -
nating from B- and T-lymphocytes and natural 
killer (NK) cells ( Swerdlow et al. , 2008 ). It is 
therefore not surprising that functional disorders 
of immune-system cells are associated with a risk 
for malignant transformation. Immune defi -
ciency is one of the strongest known risk factors 
for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) ( Hartge & 
Smith, 2007 ). The risk for NHL increases with 
the degree of immune deficiency, and there is no evidence of a threshold ( Grulich et al. , 2007 ). Thus, even modest immunosuppression, espe -
cially at the local level, may increase the risk for 
lymphoma.
It is well recognized that lymphomas, like 
other tumours, develop according to a multistep pathogenic process ( Smith et al. , 2004 ). Clonal 
progression of an initiated cell to a clone of highly 
malignant cells is well documented. Natural 
selection of clones already present within oligo -
clonal expansions gives rise to true monoclonal 
lymphomas. Thus, it is possible to make genera-
lizations about the type of molecular mecha -
nism responsible for each of the stages involved 
in lymphomagenesis. For example, a cell may 
become initiated and genetically unstable 
through errors in recombination and DNA repair, which could be spontaneous or induced by an 
exogenous chemical agent. Other early molecu-
lar events often inhibit apoptosis and lead to the expansion of an intrinsically genetically unstable 
population of cells, which is at risk for additional 
genetic events and tumour progression. An example is the t(14;18) chromosome transloca -
tion associated with B-cell lymphoma 2 gene BCL2  dysregulation, which inhibits apoptosis 
(Cimmino et al. , 2005 ; Thomadaki & Scorilas, 
2006 ). Normally, one of the key protectors against 
the selection and progression of malignant clones of cells into full-blown lymphoma is local 
immunosurveillance in which activated T-cells 
kill the mutated clones. It is generally accepted that if this immunosurveillance is no longer 
intact, e.g. in immuno-suppressed individuals, 
then the malignant cells divide and grow rapidly, collecting more mutations to become aggressive, 
rapidly growing tumours.
(b) Mechanisms of benzene-induced lymphoma 
development
From the discussion above, there are at least 
two probable mechanisms by which exposure to benzene could enhance the incidence of 
lymphoma, i.e. by inducing chromosome rear -
rangements associated with NHL, and through 
284Benzene
immunosuppression leading to decreased 
immunosurveillance.
Benzene is well known to produce multiple 
cytogenetic abnormalities in lymphocytes ( Tough 
& Brown, 1965 ; Forni, 1971 , 1979 ; Picciano, 1979 ; 
Smith & Zhang, 1998 ; Zhang et al. , 2002 ). Further, 
benzene induces specific chromosomal changes associated with NHL in human lymphocytes 
(Zhang et al. , 2007 ). Fluorescence in situ hybridi -
zation (FISH) analysis showed increased levels of 
t(14;18) and del(6q) in benzene-exposed workers, 
but the higher levels of t(14;18) could not be 
confirmed in a follow-up study by use of real time-PCR (polymerase chain reaction) ( McHale et al. , 
2008 ). This may be because the PCR method only 
detected 50% of t(14;18) translocations or that the FISH method detects non-functional as well as 
functional translocations. Reduced immuno -
surveillance is another potential mechanism of 
NHL induction by benzene. The importance of 
T-cell immunosurveillance in preventing B-cell 
neoplasia is well established and is carried out by activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The toxic 
effects of benzene on T-cells is well documented 
and there appears to be a selective effect on CD4
+ 
T-lymphocytes resulting in a lowering of the 
CD4+/CD8+ ratio ( Lan et al. , 2004 ). This immu -
nosuppressive pattern is similar to the early onset of acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome 
(AIDS), and although it is not as severe it may be associated with an increased risk for NHL 
(Grulich et al. , 2007 ). Thus, benzene, like other 
leukaemogens including alkylating agents, 
topoisomerase inhibitors, and ionizing radia -
tion, may cause NHL through a combination of immunosuppression and DNA double-strand break induction that leads to illegitimate recom -
bination and chromosome rearrangements in lymphoid cells.
Thus, the biological plausibility of benzene 
as a cause of lymphoproliferative disorders has been strengthened in recent years. There are additional studies demonstrating that benzene 
produces lymphomas in laboratory animals, and a recent study showing that it does so simul -
taneously with AML in Tp53 -deficient mice 
(Kawasaki et al. , 2009 ). Multiple studies show 
that it produces genotoxicity in the lymphocytes 
of exposed humans. Accordingly, there is consid -
erable support for the notion that it is biologically plausible for benzene to cause human lymphatic tumours.
5. Evaluation
There is sufficient evidence  in humans for 
the carcinogenicity of benzene. Benzene causes 
acute myeloid leukaemia/acute non-lymphocytic 
leukaemia.
Also, a positive association has been observed 
between exposure to benzene and acute lympho -
cytic leukaemia, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, multiple myeloma, and  non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
There is sufficient evidence  for the carcino -
genicity of benzene in experimental animals.
There is strong evidence that benzene 
metabolites, acting alone or in concert, produce multiple genotoxic effects at the level of the pluripotent haematopoietic stem cell resulting 
in chromosomal changes in humans consistent 
with those seen in haematopoietic cancer. In multiple studies in different occupational popu -
lations in many countries over more than three decades a variety of genotoxic changes, including chromosomal abnormalities, have been found in 
the lymphocytes of workers exposed to benzene.
Benzene is carcinogenic to humans (Group 1) .

1.2 Uses
BCME and CMME are used primarily as 
chemical intermediates and alkylating agents. BCME is used as a laboratory reagent in the 
manufacture of plastics, ion-exchange resins, and polymers ( HSDB, 2003 ). Historical uses of BIS(CHLOROMETHYL) ETHER AND 
CHLOROMETHYL METHYL ETHER
Bis(chloromethyl) ether (BCME) and chloromethyl methyl ether (CMME) were considered 
by previous IARC Working Groups in 1973 and 1987 ( IARC, 1974 , 1987a ). Since that time new 
data have become available, which have been incorporated in this Monograph , and taken 
into consideration in the present evaluation.IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
BCME include crosslinking of cellulose, prepa -
ration of styrene and other polymers, surface 
treatment of vulcanized rubber to increase adhe -
sion, and manufacture of flame-retardant fabrics 
(ATSDR, 1989 ). CMME is used as an alkylating 
agent and industrial solvent to manufacture dodecylbenzyl chloride, water repellants, ion-exchange resins, and polymers, and as a chloro -
methylating reagent ( HSDB, 2003 ).
Exposure to these chemicals is strictly regu -
lated in the United States of America (USA) 
and worldwide. Small quantities of BCME and 
CMME are currently produced, to be used only in enclosed systems for the synthesis of other 
chemicals ( Brüske-Hohlfeld, 2009 ).
1.3 Human exposure
1.3.1  Occupational exposure
The primary route of occupational expo -
sure to BCME or CMME is through inhalation of vapours; however, the potential for exposure 
nowadays is low because these chemicals are no longer produced or sold in large quantities and 
most industrial operations with these chemicals 
are conducted in closed containers. The most likely source of exposure to BCME is during the 
production or use of chemicals in which it may 
be present as a contaminant or be formed inad -
vertently ( ATSDR, 1989 ).
CAREX (CARcinogen EXposure) is an inter -
national information system on occupational exposure to known and suspected carcinogens, based on data collected in the European Union (EU) from 1990 to 1993. The CAREX database 
provides selected exposure data and documented 
estimates of the number of exposed workers by country, carcinogen, and industry ( Kauppinen 
et al ., 2000 ). Table  1.1  presents the numbers of 
workers exposed to BCME and CMME in the EU by industry ( CAREX, 1999 )
From the US National Occupational 
Exposure Survey (1981–83) it was estimated that 14 workers (all laboratory personnel, including 
five women) were potentially exposed to BCME. 
No estimate of potential CMME exposure was reported ( NIOSH, 1984 ).
1.3.2  Non-occupational exposure
The primary routes of potential human expo -
sure to BCME and technical-grade CMME are 
inhalation and dermal contact. BCME is rapidly 
degraded in the environment and has not been detected in ambient air or water ( ATSDR, 1989 ). 
According to the US Environmental Protection Agency’s Toxics Release Inventory, almost all environmental releases of BCME and CMME

BCME and CMME were evaluated previously 
in IARC Monograph  Volume 4 and in Supplement 
7 (IARC, 1974 , 1987a ).

From CAREX (1999)BCME and CMME
In a retrospective study of a small group of 
men exposed to BCME during the period 1956–
1962, six cases of lung cancer were found among 
18 workers in a testing laboratory. Five of these six men were moderate smokers, one was a non-
smoker. Two further cases of lung cancer were 
seen in a group of 50 production workers. Five of these eight cases were oat-cell carcinomas. 
Duration of exposure had been six to nine years, 
while the period from first exposure to diagnosis was 8–16 years (Thiess et al., 1973 ; IARC, 1974 ).
In a five-year observational study of 125 
workers exposed to CMME, four cases of lung cancer were diagnosed, representing an eight -
fold higher incidence than that in a control group ( n = 2804) with similar smoking history. 
In a retrospective follow-up, a total of 14 cases 
were identified, all of whom had been working 
in the production of CMME. In the latter group, three men were non-smokers. Duration of expo -
sure had been 3–14 years. Histological analysis revealed that 12 of the 14 cases were oat-cell carci -
nomas ( Figueroa et al ., 1973 ; IARC, 1974 ). This 
cohort was further reported on ( Weiss & Boucot, 
1975 ; Weiss et al ., 1979 ; Weiss, 1982 , Weiss & 
Nash, 1997 ) with confirmatory results (Table 2.1, 
available at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100F/100F-20-Table2.1.pdf ).
Several additional case-reports ( Bettendorf, 
1977 ; Reznik et al ., 1978 ; Roe, 1985 ; Nishimura 
et al ., 1990 ) and epidemiological studies from 
the USA ( Collingwood et al ., 1987 ), the United 
Kingdom ( McCallum et al ., 1983 ) and France 
(Gowers et al ., 1993 ) demonstrated that workers 
exposed to CMME and/or BCME have an 
increased risk for lung cancer. Among heavily 
exposed workers, the relative risks were ten-fold or more. An increase in risk was observed 
with duration of exposure and with cumulative 
exposure. Histological evaluation indicated that exposure resulted primarily in small-cell type 
lung cancer ( Weiss & Boucot, 1975 ). The highest 
relative risks appeared to occur 15–19 years after 
first exposure ( Weiss, 1982 ), and latency was shortened among workers with heavier exposure (Weiss & Figueroa, 1976 ; Pasternack & Shore, 
1981 ).
3. Cancer in Experimental Animals
3.1 BCME
Studies on the carcinogenesis of BCME in 
rats, mice and hamsters after inhalation, skin 
application, and subcutaneous or intra-perito -
neal injection have been reviewed in previous 
IARC Monographs ( IARC, 1974 , 1987b ). The 
results of adequately conducted carcinogenicity studies are summarized in Tables 3.1 , 3.2, 3.3, 3.4. 
There were no additional studies reported in the 
literature since IARC Monographs  Supplement 7 
(IARC, 1987b ).
BCME was tested for carcinogenicity by 
inhalation exposure in five studies with rats, one 
study with mice and two studies with hamsters; by skin application in two studies with mice; by 
subcutaneous injection in one study with rats 
and three with mice; and by intra-peritoneal injection in one study with mice.
Exposure to BCME by inhalation caused an 
increased incidence of rare malignant tumours of the nose (esthesioneuroepitheliomas and 
squamous-cell carcinomas of the nasal mucosa) 
and squamous-cell carcinomas of the lung in male rats ( Kuschner et al ., 1975 ; Leong et al ., 
1981 ; Albert et al ., 1982 ; Sellakumar et al ., 1985 ) 
and of lung adenomas in male mice ( Leong 
et al ., 1981 ). Skin application of BCME resulted 
in an increased incidence of skin papillomas in male and female mice ( Van Duuren et al ., 1969 ; 
Zajdela et al ., 1980 ) and of squamous-cell carci -
nomas of the skin in female mice ( Van Duuren 
et al ., 1969 ). Intra-peritoneal injection caused 
increased incidences of sarcomas at the site of 
injection in female mice ( Van Duuren et al ., 
1975 ). Subcutaneous injection of BCME caused 
strongly increased incidences of lung adenomas

amount of BCME in the exposure chamber of the premixed HCl-HCHO was less than 1 ppb, BCME may not have 
been the only agent responsible for the

3.2 CMME
Studies on the carcinogenesis of CMME 
administered to mice, rats and hamsters by 
inhalation, skin application and subcutaneous 
injection have been reviewed in previous IARC Monographs  (IARC, 1974 , 1987b ). The results of 
adequately conducted carcinogenicity studies are summarized in Tables 3.5 , 3.6. There were no 
additional studies reported in the literature since 
the previous IARC Monograph  (IARC, 1987b ).
CMME was tested for carcinogenicity by 
inhalation exposure in one study in rats, one in mice and one in hamsters; by skin application in 
one study in mice; and by subcutaneous injection in one study in rats and two in mice.
Technical grade CMME induced skin 
sarcomas in female mice following subcutaneous injection ( Van Duuren et al ., 1972 ). In a skin-
painting study in female mice, CMME was found to be a probable initiator of skin papillomas and carcinomas combined ( Van Duuren et al ., 1969 ).
4. Other Relevant Data
4.1 Toxicokinetics and toxicity
BCME and CMME belong to the group of 
chloroalkyl ethers. In water and aqueous biolo-
gical fluids these substances are rapidly hydro -
lysed to form hydrochloric acid, methanol and 
formaldehyde (Nichols & Merritt, 1973 ; NTP, 
2005 ).
The toxic effects of BCME are restricted to 
the epithelial tissue where exposure occurs, and this is consistent with the short half-life of BCME in aqueous media ( ATSDR, 1989 ).
4.2 Genetic and related effects
Studies on the genotoxicity and cytotoxicity 
of BCME and CMME are limited and yielded 
mixed results ( IARC, 1987b ). [These studies are 
generally poorly documented.]
Both BCME and CMME are powerful 
alkylating agents ( Van Duuren et al ., 1968 ; Van 
Duuren & Van Duuren, 1988 ; Van Duuren, 
1989 ) that are mutagenic in bacteria ( Mukai & 
Hawryluk, 1973 ; Anderson & Styles, 1978 ; IARC, 
1987b ). [The Working Group noted that the test 
systems used may not be optimal for investi -
gating effects of rapidly hydrolysing material. 
Specifically, since BCME and CMME are short-lived alkylating agents, tests that favour hydro-
lysis of the compound before it enters the cell 
may yield misleading results.]
In one study, reaction of BCME with DNA 
in vitro  did not affect the melting temperature or 
the buoyant density of the DNA, nor did it yield isolatable products upon reaction with purines 
or DNA, as did other alkylating agents ( Van 
Duuren et al., 1972 ). In another study, BCME was 
shown to bind to calf-thymus DNA at guanine and adenine residues ( Goldschmidt et al., 1975 ).
In vitro , CMME enhanced virus-induced 
transformation of Syrian hamster embryo cells ( Casto, 1983 ; IARC, 1987b ) and elicited 
unscheduled DNA synthesis, reflecting its 
activity as a DNA-damaging agent, in cultured 
human lymphocytes ( Perocco et al., 1983 ).
BCME did not cause chromosomal aberra -
tions in bone-marrow cells of rats exposed to vapours for six months ( Leong et al., 1981 ; IARC, 
1987b ) but it did induce unscheduled DNA 
synthesis ( Agrelo & Severn, 1981 ; IARC, 1987b ) 
and cell transformation ( Kurian et al ., 1990 ) in 
cultured human fibroblasts.
A slight increase in the incidence of chro -
mosomal aberrations was observed in blood 
305IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
lymphocytes of workers exposed to BCME or 
CMME during the preparation of ion-exchange 
resins ( Srám et al., 1983 ; IARC, 1987b ).
4.3 Mechanistic considerations
The limited experimental studies on BCME 
and CMME preclude a detailed understanding of a mechanism of action, but sufficient infor -
mation is available to support a genotoxic mode 
of action. Bernucci et al . (1997)  outlined some 
possible steps in the process by which BCME and CMME may contribute to carcinogenesis. Similar to other alkylating agents, the observed 
formation of DNA adducts and resultant muta -
tions are likely key steps in their mechanism of 
carcinogenicity. However, very little is known 
regarding their covalent interaction with DNA.
The hydrolysis products of BCME are formal -
dehyde and hydrochloric acid (HCl). Since formaldehyde is carcinogenic in animals and 
humans (see the Monograph  on Formaldehyde 
in this volume), at least some of the carcinogenic 
potential of BCME may be due to this degrada -
tion product. However, the difference in carci -
nogenic potency between the two compounds (BCME being much more potent than formalde -
hyde) would indicate that this cannot be the sole 
mechanism of carcinogenicity.
BCME, formaldehyde and HCl could interact 
synergistically within the cell. Exposure of rats to mixtures of formaldehyde and HCl by inhalation 
resulted in little change in the frequency of nasal 
tumours compared with exposure to formalde -
hyde alone. However, one animal developed an 
esthesioneuroepithelioma, a very rare tumour 
that is characteristic of BCME exposure ( Albert 
et al., 1982 ; Sellakumar et al., 1985 ).4.4 Synthesis
BCME is among the most potent animal and 
human carcinogens known. The fact that BCME 
and CMME are powerful alkylating agents 
provides moderate to strong evidence that they operate by a genotoxic mechanism of action. This 
mechanism is likely to be similar to that of other 
strong alkylating agents, involving modification of DNA and resultant mutations.
5. Evaluation
There is sufficient evidence  in humans for the 
carcinogenicity of bis(chloromethyl)ether and 
chloromethyl methyl ether (technical grade). 
Bis(chloromethyl)ether and chloromethyl methyl ether (technical grade) cause cancer of the lung.
There is sufficient evidence  in experi -
mental animals for the carcinogenicity of bis(chloromethyl)ether.
There is limited evidence  in experimental 
animals for the carcinogenicity of chloromethyl methyl ether.
There is moderate to strong evidence that 
bis(chloromethyl)ether and chloromethyl methyl ether, powerful alkylating agents, operate by a 
genotoxic mechanism. This mechanism is likely 
to be similar to that of other strong alkylating agents, involving modification of DNA and 
resultant mutations.
Bis(chloromethyl)ether and chloromethyl 
methyl ether (technical grade) are carcinogenic to humans (Group 1) .

1.2 Use
Butadiene is used primarily in the produc -
tion of synthetic rubbers and polymers, which 
are used in a wide variety of industrial and 
consumer products (e.g. automobiles, construc -
tion materials, appliance parts, computers 
and telecommunication equipment, protective 
clothing, packaging and household articles). The advantages of butadiene-based polymers include improved functionality, performance and safety, 
and lower costs. Synthetic rubbers that are 
produced from butadiene include styrene-buta -
diene rubber, poly-butadiene rubber, styrene-
butadiene latex, chloroprene rubber and nitrile 
rubber. Important plastics that contain butadiene as a monomeric component are shock-resistant 
polystyrene, a two-phase system that consists of 
polystyrene and poly-butadiene; polymers that consist of acrylonitrile, butadiene and styrene; 
and a co-polymer of methyl methacrylate, buta -
diene and styrene, which is used as a modifier for 
polyvinyl chloride. Butadiene is also used as an 
intermediate in the production of chloroprene, 
adiponitrile and other basic petrochemicals (White, 2007 ).
1.3 Human exposure
1.3.1  Occupational exposure
The highest exposures to butadiene occur in 
occupational settings. The potential for expo -
sure exists in several industrial activities, such as petroleum refining and related operations (production of C4 fractions containing buta -
diene, and production and distribution of gaso -
line), production of purified butadiene monomer, 1,3-BUTADIENE
1,3-Butadiene was considered by previous IARC Working Groups in 1991, 1998, and 2007 
(IARC, 1992 , 1999 , 2008 ). Since that time new data have become available, which have been 
incorporated in this Monograph , and taken into consideration in the present evaluation.IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
production of various butadiene-based rubber 
and plastic polymers and other derivatives, and 
manufacture of rubber and plastic products, such 
as tyres, hoses and a variety of moulded objects (IARC, 1999 ).
Estimates of the number of workers poten -
tially exposed to 1,3-butadiene have been devel -
oped by CAREX (CARcinogen EXposure) in 
Europe. CAREX is an international information 
system that provides selected exposure data and documented estimates of the number of exposed 
workers by country, carcinogen, and industry 
(Kauppinen et al ., 2000 ). Based on occupational 
exposure to known and suspected carcinogens 
collected from 1990 to 1993, the CAREX data -
base estimates that 31 600 workers were exposed 
to 1,3-butadiene in the European Union (EU). 
Table 1.1  presents the number of exposed workers 
for 1,3-butadiene (top 10 industries) in the EU by 
industry ( CAREX, 1999 ).
From the US National Occupational 
Exposure Survey (1981–1983) it was estimated that approximately 52  000 workers (including 
approximately 1400 women) were potentially 
exposed to 1,3-butadiene ( NIOSH, 1990 ).
No measurements of exposure in butadiene-
monomer production before the 1970s are avail -
able, but exposure levels have decreased from up to 20 mg/m3 to less than 2 mg/m3 between the 
late 1970s and the early 2000s ( IARC, 2008 ). In 
styrene-butadiene polymer production, the esti -
mated median levels of exposure to butadiene in earlier decades varied in the range 8–20 mg/m
3, 
while current exposure measurements in modern 
facilities in North America and western 
Europe generally show values below 2 mg/m3. 
Concentrations of butadiene-in-air reported 
from the People’s Republic of China are some -
what higher (~4 mg/m3) (IARC, 2008 ). Butadiene 
is not usually found in detectable concentra -
tions in workplace air during the manufacture 
of finished rubber and plastic products ( IARC, 
1999 ). Regardless of the type of factory, produc -
tion process, or country, some tasks are still char -
acterized by very high exposures (~200 mg/m3), 
which are typically short in duration ( IARC, 
2008 ). For a detailed description of studies on 
occupational exposure to butadiene and Tables with data summarizing the results, the reader is 
referred to IARC Monographs  Volumes 71 and 97 
(IARC, 1999 , 2008 ).
The utility of haemoglobin adducts as 
biomarkers of human exposure to butadiene has 
been investigated in several molecular epidemio -
logical studies that often included the measure -
ment of urinary metabolites and personal-air

1.3.2  Non-occupational exposure
Butadiene has been widely detected in 
ambient air but at much lower levels (µg/m3) 
than reported in some occupational settings 
(mg/m3). Elevated concentrations may occur in 
the vicinity of point sources, such as municipal structural fires, wood and brush fires; cigarette 
smoking; vehicle emissions and gasoline vola -
tilization ( IARC, 2008 ). Studies on non-occu -
pational exposures to 1,3-butadiene have been reviewed in previous IARC Monographs  (IARC, 
1999 , 2008 ).
In a study conducted between 1990 and 1994, 
concentrations of butadiene were determined in 1611 samples of outdoor air from 25 sites within 
14 cities, towns or rural locations in Ontario, 
Canada. The mean concentration in all samples was 0.1 μg/m
3 (maximum, 1.7 μg/m3) (Health 
Canada, 2000 ).
Dollard et al . (2007)  measured butadiene 
concentrations at rural, urban background (UB), urban industry-influenced (UI) and ‘busy-road-
traffic’ (BR) locations in the United Kingdom 
from 1993 to 2004. Mean rural levels dropped from 0.39 to 0.02 µg/m
3 between 1995 and 2004; 
mean UB levels decreased from 0.64 to 0.15 µg/m3 
in 1993–2004; mean UI levels came down from 
0.85 to 0.35 µg/m3 in 1995–2000; and mean BR 
levels went from 3.3 to 0.57 µg/m3 in the period 
1997–2004.
2. Cancer in Humans
In IARC Monograph  Volume 97 ( IARC, 
2008 ) three cohort studies of workers in the 
butadiene-monomer industry were reviewed 
(Ward et al ., 1995 ; Divine & Hartman, 2001 ; 
Tsai et al ., 2001 ), along with two cohort studies of workers in the styrene–butadiene rubber (SBR) industry ( McMichael et al ., 1974 , 1976 ; 
Meinhardt et al ., 1982 ; Matanoski & Schwartz, 
1987 ; Matanoski et al ., 1990 , 1993 ; see Table 2.1, 
available at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/
Monographs/vol100F/100F-21-Table2.1.pdf ). The 
excess of mortality from leukaemia in one of the 
butadiene-monomer industry cohorts, which did 
not increase with duration of exposure or with 
cumulative exposure, was more pronounced among workers who had been exposed during the 
Second World War, when exposures to butadiene 
had probably been higher ( Divine & Hartman, 
2001 ). These cohorts were subsequently combined, 
although data from one styrene-butadiene plant were excluded because the information was incomplete ( Delzell et al ., 1996 ; Macaluso et al ., 
2004 ; Graff et al., 2005 ; Sathiakumar et al., 2005 ; 
Delzell et al ., 2006 ; Cheng et al ., 2007 ). A series 
of overlapping analyses examined the mortality 
of approximately 17  000 male workers from 
eight SBR-manufacturing facilities in the USA and Canada (see Table  2.1 online). A limiting 
factor was that diagnosis and classification of 
lymphatic and haematopoietic malignancies are extremely complex, and that these underwent 
several changes over the course of time. Although 
mortality from leukaemia was only slightly elevated in the most recent updates ( Sathiakumar 
et al., 2005 ; Delzell et al., 2006 ; Cheng et al., 2007 ), 
large excesses of mortality from leukaemia were seen in workers in the most highly exposed areas 
of the plants and among hourly-paid workers, 
especially those who had been hired in the early years and had been employed for more than ten 
years. These excesses were attributable to both 
chronic lymphocytic and chronic myelogenous leukaemia, with significant exposure–response 
relationships between cumulative exposure to 
butadiene and mortality from both leukaemia types. The most recent analyses showed that the 
exposure–response for butadiene and leukaemia 
was independent of exposures to benzene, 
311IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
styrene and dimethyl-dithiocarbamate ( Delzell 
et al., 2006 ; Cheng et al., 2007 ).
The strongest evidence of an associa -
tion between exposure to butadiene and non-
Hodgkin lymphoma comes from studies in 
the butadiene-monomer industry ( Ward et al ., 
1995 , 1996 ; Divine & Hartman, 2001 ). Although 
this association did not become stronger with duration of exposure, it was more pronounced 
among workers who had been exposed during the Second World War, when exposures had 
presumably been higher.
Whitworth et al. (2008)  conducted an ecolo-
gical study in South-eastern Texas that assessed whether census tracts with the highest ambient-
air concentrations of benzene or 1,3-butadiene have a higher incidence of lymphohaemato-
poietic cancer in children. The analysis included 
977 cases of childhood lymphohaematopoietic cancer diagnosed from 1995–2004. Estimates 
of airborne concentrations of benzene and 
1,3-butadiene were obtained for 886 census tracts by use of the models proposed in 1999 by the 
US Environmental Protection Agency. Poisson-
regression models were used to explore the asso -
ciations between pollutant levels and census-tract 
cancer rates. Adjustments were made for age, sex, 
race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status at the community level. Census tracts with the highest 
1,3-butadiene concentrations had rate ratios of 
1.4 (95%CI: 1.1–1.8), 1.7 (95%CI: 0.8–3.4), and 1.3 (95%CI: 1.0–1.8) for all leukaemia, acute myeloid 
leukaemia and acute lymphocytic leukaemia, 
respectively. A statistically significant dose–response trend was noted for all leukaemia. No 
association was found between 1,3-butadiene 
concentrations and lymphoma incidence. An excess of leukaemia was also found in associa -
tion with environmental exposure to benzene, but analyses that examined both exposures simultaneously indicated that the effects were 
independent. [The Working Group noted that 
environmental levels of butadiene are consider -
ably lower than in industrial settings but children may be a more sensitive group. However, poten -
tial confounding factors have not been fully 
addressed and the findings need to be confirmed 
in future studies.]
The mortality of women in the styrene-
butadiene cohort has also been evaluated (Sathiakumar & Delzell, 2007 , 2009 ; see Table 2.1 
online). No increased risks were found for 
leukaemia or lymphoma. Statistically signifi -
cant positive SMRs were seen for cancers of the 
lung and bladder. [Unlike in the male cohorts, 
the female cases were not confirmed pathologi -
cally, the exposure level was low, most women 
were short-term workers (median duration of 
employment was approximately 1.7  years; 70% 
had worked during less than four years), and only 30% of women were exposed to butadiene 
and styrene.]
In a further analysis of this SBR cohort, the 
lung-cancer risk among men and women was evaluated. Among men there was no indica -
tion of an increased risk for lung cancer and no 
evidence for an internal dose–response. Among 
women there was evidence of an increased risk 
for lung cancer, although there was no evidence for an internal dose–response in the exposed 
group ( Sathiakumar & Delzell, 2009 ).
Overall, the epidemiological evidence 
from the styrene-butadiene and the butadiene-monomer industries clearly indicates an increased 
risk for haematolymphatic malignancies. Studies from the styrene-butadiene industry show an 
excess of leukaemia, and a dose–response rela -
tionship with cumulative exposure to butadiene, 
while studies from the monomer industry show 
an excess of haematolymphatic malignan -
cies in general, attributable both to leukaemia 
and malignant lymphoma. The evidence for an 
association between exposure to butadiene and 
cancer of the haematolymphatic organs has gained some support by findings of an associa -
tion between environmental levels of butadiene and risk for leukaemia in children.
3121,3-Butadiene
The epidemiological evidence for an associa -
tion with specific subtypes of haematolymphatic 
malignancies is weaker, mainly since numbers are 
lower, giving imprecise risk estimates. However, when malignant lymphomas and leukaemias 
are distinguished, the evidence is strongest for 
leukaemia.
3. Cancer in Experimental Animals
3.1 1,3-Butadiene
Studies on the carcinogenesis of 1,3-butadiene 
in rats and mice have been reviewed in previous 
IARC Monographs  (IARC, 1999 , 2008 ) and by 
Grosse et al . (2007) . The results of adequately 
conducted carcinogenicity studies are summa -
rized in Table  3.1 . There were no additional 
studies reported in the published literature since 
IARC Monograph  Volume 97 ( IARC, 2008 ).
1,3-Butadiene was tested for carcinogenicity 
by inhalation exposure in one study in rats and four studies in mice.
Inhalation of 1,3-butadiene induced tumours 
in rats at exposure concentrations ranging from 1000 to 8000 ppm [2200–17650 mg/m
3], 
and in multiple organs in mice at exposure 
concentrations ranging from 6.25 to 1250 ppm 
[13.8–2760 mg/m3]. In rats, 1,3-butadiene caused 
a significantly increased incidence of carcinomas 
of the Zymbal gland, sarcomas of the uterus, 
adenomas and carcinomas (combined) of the mammary gland, and follicular cell adenomas of 
the thyroid gland in females. In males, it caused 
malignant gliomas and adenomas of the pancreas and testes in males ( Owen et al ., 1987 ; Owen 
& Glaister, 1990 ; Melnick et al ., 1993 ; Melnick 
& Huff, 1993 ). In mice of both sexes, 1,3-buta -
diene caused a significantly increased incidence 
of Harderian gland adenomas and carcinomas, 
heart haemangiosarcomas, lymphoid tissue neoplasms (lymphoma, histiocytic sarcoma), 
lung adenomas and carcinomas, hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas, and fore-stomach 
papillomas and carcinomas. It caused mammary 
gland cancers, benign tumours and carcinomas 
of the ovary, and skin sarcomas in females. It also caused preputial gland carcinomas and kidney 
tubule adenomas in males ( NTP, 1984 , 1993 ; 
Huff et al ., 1985 ; Miller et al ., 1989 ; Melnick 
et al ., 1990a , b, 1993 ; Melnick & Huff, 1993 ; 
Hong et al ., 2000 ; Melnick & Sills, 2001 ; Kim 
et al ., 2005 ). No increased incidence of tumours 
was observed in one study in mice exposed once to 1,3-butadiene at concentrations up to 10 000 
ppm [22000 mg/m
3] (Bucher et al., 1993 ).
3.2 Diepoxybutane
Diepoxybutane, a metabolite of 1,3-buta -
diene, was tested for carcinogenicity by inhala -
tion in one study in rats and one study in mice, by four skin-application studies in mice, by one subcutaneous injection study in rats and two such 
studies in mice, and by one gavage and one intra-
peritoneal injection study in mice ( Tables 3.1 , 3.2, 
3.3, 3.4).
Diepoxybutane increased the incidence of 
adenomas of the Harderian gland in female mice, and of squamous cell carcinoma of the nose in 
female rats after inhalation exposure ( Henderson 
et al ., 1999 , 2000 ). Subcutaneous injection 
resulted in an increased incidence of fibrosar -
comas in female rats and female mice. The gavage 
study in mice did not produce any tumours ( Van 
Duuren et al ., 1966 ). Intra-peritoneal injection 
led to an increased incidence of lung tumours in strain A/J mice ( Shimkin et al ., 1966 ). Two 
skin-application studies in mice resulted in an 
increased incidence of dermoid carcinomas ( Van 
Duuren et al., 1963 , 1965 ).

4. Other Relevant Data
Experimental studies on butadiene have 
been evaluated in previous IARC Monographs  
(IARC, 1999 , 2008 ). There is an extensive body 
of data on the mechanism of butadiene-induced 
carcinogenicity, encompassing toxicokinetics, 
metabolism, biomarkers, genotoxicity, and 
molecular biology. The carcinogenicity of buta -
diene is mediated by its metabolites. This view 
is based largely on the observations that buta -
diene-induced mutagenicity requires metabolic 
activation ( Jackson et al ., 2000 ) and that the 
DNA-reactive epoxides formed during butadiene bio-transformation are direct-acting mutagens (IARC, 1999 , 2008 ). Thus, butadiene metabo -
lism, formation of reactive epoxides, interaction of these epoxides with DNA, and resultant muta -
genicity are likely key steps in the mechanism of 
carcinogenicity for this agent.
4.1 Metabolism of butadiene
The detailed pathways in the metabolism 
of butadiene have been described previously (Himmelstein et al ., 1997 ; IARC 1999 , 2008 ) 
and are outlined in Fig.  4.1. Briefly, the first 
step in butadiene metabolism involves cyto -
chrome P450 (CYP)-mediated oxidation to epoxybutene ( Himmelstein et al ., 1997 ). At 
low concentrations of butadiene, metabolism 
via CYP2E1 predominates ( IARC, 1999 , 2008 ). 
Epoxybutene may be metabolized by conjugation 
with glutathione (GSH) mediated by glutathione 
S-transferase (GST), or by hydrolysis catalysed 
by epoxide hydrolase (EH) ( Csanády et al., 1992 ; 
Himmelstein et al ., 1997 ). Epoxybutene may 
also be oxidized to multiple diastereomers of 
diepoxybutane ( Seaton et al ., 1995 ; Krause & 
Elfarra, 1997 ), while dihydroxybutene formed 
by hydrolysis of epoxybutene may be oxidized to epoxybutanediol. The latter epoxides are also detoxified by GST or EH ( Boogaard et al., 1996a , b). Partial hydrolysis of diepoxybutane also 
produces epoxybutanediol.
Each of the epoxide intermediates may 
contribute to the mutagenicity and carcino -
genicity of butadiene. Factors that impact their 
relative contributions include concentration in 
tissues, reactivity with DNA, and repair of the ensuing DNA adducts. Variability in the expres -
sion of key enzymes involved in the biotrans -
formation of butadiene may have an effect on metabolite concentrations in tissues, and on the 
subsequent mutagenic response ( IARC, 2008 ). 
For example, genetically modified mice that 
are deficient in microsomal epoxide hydrolase 
(mEH) activity are more susceptible than wild-
type mice to the mutagenic effects of butadiene and diepoxybutane, presumably because tissue 
concentrations of the epoxides are higher in the 
mEH-deficient mice ( Wickliffe et al ., 2003 ). The 
detection of metabolites derived from hydroxym -
ethylvinylketone and crotonaldehyde in the urine of rats or mice treated with butenediol suggests that these compounds may also be formed during 
the metabolism of butadiene ( Sprague & Elfarra, 
2003, 2004 ). The potential contribution of these 
DNA-alkylating agents (hydroxymethylvinylk -
etone and crotonaldehyde) to the mutagenicity 
and carcinogenicity of butadiene is not known.
The enzymes that catalyse epoxide forma -
tion and elimination are polymorphic in human populations and some may be induced by a variety of environmental and pharmaceutical agents. 
While some reports indicate that genetic poly -
morphisms in GST and mEH affect the in-vitro 
mutagenicity of butadiene-derived epoxides or 
the in-vivo mutagenicity of butadiene in occupa -
tionally exposed workers ( Wiencke et al ., 1995 ; 
Abdel-Rahman et al ., 2003 ), the extent to which 
these enzyme polymorphisms influence the 
carcinogenicity of butadiene is not known. Rates of butadiene metabolism have been reported for 
human tissues cultured in vitro . However, the 
range of observed rates is limited by the extent 
of the inter-individual variability in CYP, EH

From IARC (2008)1,3-Butadiene
and GST activities of the tissues sampled, and by 
the fact that only small numbers of human liver 
and lung samples were analysed ( Csanády, et al., 
1992 ; Seaton, et al ., 1995 ; Boogaard, et al.  1996 
a, b; Bolt et al ., 2003 ; Thier et al ., 2003 ; Norppa, 
2004 ; Schlade-Bartusiak et al ., 2004 ). Thus, the 
actual kinetic range of the metabolism of buta -
diene in the human population is unknown.
The metabolism of butadiene in mice and rats 
shows linear elimination kinetics at exposures 
of up to about 1000 ppm [2210 mg/m3] (Kreiling 
et al ., 1986b ). Responses that increase propor -
tionally above the levels of metabolic satura -
tion probably represent effects of the parent compound. In the range of linear kinetics, mice 
metabolize butadiene about twice as rapidly as 
do rats. Although epoxybutene is formed prima -
rily through CYP-mediated oxidation of buta -
diene, the formation of this alkylating agent by a myeloperoxidase-catalysed reaction in bone-marrow cells ( Maniglier-Poulet et al., 1995 ) may 
be relevant to the induction of haematopoietic cancers in mice and humans.
Data on urinary metabolites indicate that 
the elimination of epoxybutene in mice occurs to a greater extent by conjugation with GSH than by hydrolysis ( IARC, 1999 , 2008 ). Although no 
studies have been reported that characterize the full profile of urinary metabolites of butadiene in humans, the high ratio of 1,2-dihydroxybutyl-
mercapturic acid (DHBMA) vs  monohydroxy-3-
butenyl-mercapturic acid (MHBMA) in exposed 
workers indicates that epoxybutene is prefer -
entially metabolized by hydrolysis in humans (IARC, 2008 ). In rats, metabolic elimination of 
epoxybutene formed from butadiene occurs to 
a similar extent by hydrolysis or GSH conjuga -
tion. In molecular epidemiological studies of 
occupational exposure to butadiene, the ratio of 
MHBMA to MHBMA + DHBMA was lower in 
workers who were homozygous for GSTM1 -null 
and GSTT1 -null ( Albertini et al., 2001 , 2003 ).
The formation of epoxybutanediol or 
diepoxybutane requires a second oxidation of either butenediol or epoxybutene, respectively. At increasing exposure concentrations of butadiene, 
competition between butadiene and butenediol 
or epoxybutene for CYP may limit the extent to which the second oxidation reaction may occur. 
Consequently, concentration of epoxybutanediol 
in blood is greater in rats exposed to 200 ppm [442 mg/m3] butadiene than in those exposed to 
1000 ppm [2210 mg/m
3] or higher ( Filser et al ., 
2007 ). Competitive inhibition by butadiene of 
the second oxidation ( Filser et al ., 2001 ) may 
account for the greater Hprt  mutation efficiency 
in rats exposed to 62.5 ppm [138 mg/m3] or mice 
exposed to 3 ppm [6.63 mg/m3] compared with 
exposure of either species to 625 or 1250 ppm [1381 or 2762.5 mg/m
3] (Meng et al., 2007 ). Thus, 
high-dose studies of butadiene (>  625 ppm) in animals may not adequately reveal the full muta -
genic or carcinogenic potential of this substance 
at lower levels of exposure.
4.2 Haemoglobin adducts
While haemoglobin adducts are not causally 
related to mutagenic events, they offer an effective 
measure of exposure to reactive intermediates 
of chemicals. Haemoglobin adducts accumu -
late over the life-span of the erythrocyte, which 
is approximately 120 days in humans. Three 
adducts have been identified following reaction of butadiene epoxides with haemoglobin: N -(2-
hydroxy-3-butenyl)valine (MHbVal), N ,N-(2,3-
dihydroxy-1,4-butadiyl) valine (PyrVal) and N-(2,3,4-trihydroxybutyl)valine (THbVal). 
These adducts are considered to reflect blood concentrations of epoxybutene, diepoxybutane and epoxybutanediol, respectively. Each of these 
adducts has been measured in rats and mice 
exposed to butadiene at concentrations as low as 3 ppm [6.63 mg/m3]. At equivalent exposures 
to butadiene, the levels of MHbVal and PyrVal 
were higher in mice than in rats, while levels of the major adduct, THbVal, were similar in these 
species ( Boysen et al., 2004 , 2007 ). The formation 
329IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
of each of these adducts in mice and rats was 
more efficient at 3 ppm than at higher exposure 
concentrations of butadiene.
MHbVal and THbVal have also been meas -
ured in workers exposed to butadiene (mean 8-hour TWA exposures, 0.3–0.8 ppm [0.66–
1.76 mg/m
3]), while PyrVal could not be detected 
in workers exposed to mean concentrations 
of 0.37 ppm [0.82 mg/m3]. In all samples, the 
amount of the PyrVal adduct was below the limit of quantification for the assay ( Albertini et al ., 
2003, 2007 ).
Species-specific differences in the amount of 
these haemoglobin adducts reflect differences 
in exposure to butadiene, blood concentrations of the epoxide intermediates, reactivity of the 
epoxide with the N-terminal valine and other 
reactive sites in haemoglobin, and the half-life of 
the red blood cell. When the amounts of adducts 
are normalized per gram of haemoglobin per 
ppm of butadiene, the levels of MHbVal adducts in workers are slightly lower than those in rats 
exposed to 3 ppm [6.63 mg/m
3] butadiene, 
while the levels of THbVal adducts are higher in workers than in rats or mice exposed to 3 ppm 
butadiene. These data demonstrate the systemic availability of epoxybutene and epoxybutane -
diol in workers exposed to occupational levels of butadiene. In these workers, the THbVal-adduct levels are influenced by the combined polymor -
phisms for CYP2E1 , GSTM1  and GSTT1  genes 
(Fustinoni et al., 2002 ).
4.3 DNA adducts
The major DNA adducts formed in the liver, 
lung and kidney of rats and mice exposed to 
butadiene are at the N7 position of guanine. 
These adducts are: N7-(2-hydroxy-3-butenyl)guanine (G1); N7-(1-(hydroxymethyl)-2-pro-
penyl)guanine (G2); N7-(1-(hydroxymethyl)-
2,3-dihydroxypropyl)guanine (G3); N7-(2,3,4-trihydroxybut-1-yl)guanine (G4). The 
G4 adducts are much more abundant than the G1 and G2 adducts, which are derived from epoxy -
butene (Koc et al ., 1999 ). The G4 adducts reach 
a plateau in rats after exposure to about 62 ppm 
[137 mg /m3] butadiene, while G1 and G2 adducts 
increase nearly linearly with exposures to buta -
diene of up to 625 ppm [1381 mg/m3]. Powley et 
al. (2005)  have proposed that the similarity in the 
shape of the dose–response curves for THbVal-adduct formation in haemoglobin, G4-adduct formation in DNA, and Hprt  mutation induction 
in splenic T-cells from mice and rats exposed to butenediol, suggests that epoxybutanediol may play a role in the mutagenicity and carcino -
genicity of butadiene. 
N7-Guanine adducts can undergo sponta -
neous depurination, which leaves an apurinic 
site in the DNA. Epoxide metabolites of buta -
diene can also react at sites involved in base-
pairing and form adducts at N3 of cytosine, N1 
of adenine, N
6 of adenine, N1 of guanine and 
N2 of guanine ( Selzer & Elfarra, 1996a , b, 1997 ; 
Zhao et al ., 1998 ; Zhang & Elfarra, 2004 ). An 
increase in N1-trihydroxybutyladenine adducts 
was detected in lymphocytes of workers exposed to butadiene ( Zhao et al ., 2000 ). Alkylation of 
N1-adenine by epoxybutene followed by hydro -
lytic deamination under formation of deoxy-inosine is a highly mutagenic event ( Rodriguez 
et al ., 2001 ): deoxy-inosine forms a base-pair 
with cytosine during DNA replication, which leads to the generation of A→G mutations.
Diepoxybutane is a bi-functional alkylating 
agent that can form DNA–DNA crosslinks. Diepoxybutane first alkylates the N7 position 
of guanine in DNA and forms N7-(2 ′-hydroxy-
3′,4′-epoxybut-1 ′-yl)-guanine mono-adducts 
(Tretyakova et al ., 1997 ). The epoxide group 
of this adduct can then undergo hydrolysis to 
yield N7-(2 ′,3′,4′-trihydroxybut-1 ′-yl)-guanine, 
or, less frequently, react with another site in 
DNA, such as the N7 of another guanine or the 
N1 of an adenine. The latter reactions result in formation of 1,4-bis-(guan-7-yl)-2,3-butanediol 
and 1-(guan-7-yl)-4-(aden-1-yl)-2,3-butanediol 
3301,3-Butadiene
crosslinks ( Goggin et al ., 2009 ). These two 
diepoxybutane-specific DNA–DNA crosslinks 
have been identified in mice and rats exposed to 
625 ppm butadiene, with much higher amounts of both crosslinks occurring in mice compared 
with rats ( Goggin et al ., 2009 ). Depurination of 
these inter-strand or intra-strand lesions can 
induce point mutations and large deletion muta -
tions. When diepoxybutane alkylates DNA at the N
6-position of adenine, an exocyclic adenine 
adduct is formed preferentially to DNA–DNA 
crosslinked products ( Antsypovich et al ., 2007 ). 
Diepoxybutane is considered to be the most 
potent genotoxic metabolite of butadiene due to 
its strong genotoxicity and mutagenicity attrib -
uted to its ability to form DNA–DNA crosslinks.
4.4 Mutagenicity of butadiene and 
butadiene metabolites
Butadiene and its epoxide metabolites are 
genotoxic at multiple tissue sites in mice and rats, 
and in a variety of other test systems. In-vitro 
studies demonstrate that diepoxybutane is more potent than epoxybutene or epoxybutanediol 
in inducing micronuclei and gene mutations in 
mammalian cells. To investigate the role of two 1,3-butadiene (BD) metabolites, viz. 1,2-epoxy -
butene (EB) and 1,2,3,4-diepoxybutane (DEB) in the mutagenicity of the parent compound, in-vivo and in-vitro mutational spectra of BD, 
EB and DEB were analysed in lac-i -transgenic 
mice and in cultured human and rodent cells. 
A mutation that was consistently found across 
all biological systems examined was the AT→TA 
transversion, which was increased in the spleen and bone marrow of BD-exposed B6C3F1 lac-i -
transgenic mice, in Rat2 lac-i  cells exposed to EB, 
in the lungs of EB-exposed B6C3F1 lac-i -trans -
genic mice and at the HPRT  locus in human TK6 
lymphoblasts exposed to either EB or DEB ( Recio 
et al., 2001) .The mutation frequencies and mutation 
spectra induced by 3,4-epoxy-1,2-butanediol 
(EBD) and 1,2,3,4-diepoxybutane (DEB) were 
investigated at the Hprt  locus in Chinese hamster 
ovary-K1 cells (CHO-K1). EBD was mutagenic 
at levels that were approximately 100 times 
higher than mutagenic concentrations of DEB. Among 41 EBD-induced mutants, there were 16 
exon deletions, 11 GC→AT transitions, and five 
AT→GC transitions. Among 39 DEB-induced mutants, 15 exon deletions, 11 GC→AT transi -
tions and five AT→TA transversions were found. In this study, the most common base substitu -
tion induced by both substances was the GC→AT 
transition. The sites of the single base substitu -
tions that were induced by EBD and DEB were 
guanine and adenine, which is consistent with 
the DNA-adduct profiles ( Lee et al., 2002 ).
Fernandes & Lloyd (2007) have shown 
that replication of DNAs containing specific butadiene-derived 2 ′-deoxyuridine adducts in 
mammalian COS-7 cells resulted in predomi -
nantly C→T transitions. They also showed that replicative DNA polymerases were blocked by 
these lesions in vitro .
The genotoxic effects of butadiene can be 
modulated by alterations in key determinants of its metabolism, which suggests that markers of individual susceptibility can be identified. For 
example, mice that lack a functional mEH  gene 
were more susceptible than wild-type mice to the 
mutagenic effects of butadiene or diepoxybutane 
(Wickliffe et al ., 2003 ). Epoxide hydrolase (EH) 
activity varies considerably among humans. 
Butadiene-exposed workers with the genotype 
for low-activity EH were reported to be more 
susceptible to butadiene-induced genotoxicity (assessed by HPRT  mutant-variant frequency in 
lymphocytes) than individuals with the more common EH genotype ( Abdel-Rahman et al ., 
2001 , 2003 ). No significant effects were observed 
for induction of HPRT  mutations or sister chro -
matid exchange (SCE) in individuals with GSTM1  
or GSTT1  polymorphisms ( Abdel-Rahman et al., 
331IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
2001 ). These differences in response are consistent 
with the known important role of EH in the 
detoxification of butadiene epoxides in tissues in 
which these intermediates are produced.
In contrast, several other molecular epidemi -
ological studies report no effect of butadiene – at occupational exposure levels – on HPRT  muta -
tion frequency or chromosomal changes, and no 
significant associations with genotype ( Zhang 
et al., 2004 ; Albertini et al., 2001 , 2007 ; Lovreglio 
et al., 2006 ; Wickliffe et al., 2009 ). Discrepancies 
among these studies may be related to differences 
in levels of exposure to butadiene at the work -
place, the influence of exposures to butadiene or 
other genotoxic agents from other sources (e.g. 
cigarette smoke, automobile exhaust), the group size and the level of enzyme activity associated 
with a particular genotype.
The induction of SCE in human lymphocytes 
exposed in vitro  to diepoxybutane was signifi -
cantly higher in cells from GSTT1 -null indi -
viduals than from GSTT1 -positive individuals 
(Wiencke et al ., 1995 ), which indicates that the 
GST pathway may be important in the detoxifi -
cation of diepoxybutane released into the blood. 
Epoxybutene can induce SCE and chromosomal 
aberrations in human peripheral lymphocytes 
treated in vitro ; the lack of induction of these 
effects in G0 lymphocytes appears to be due 
to effective excision repair of DNA lesions 
(Kligerman et al ., 1999 ). Other studies also 
demonstrate the importance of DNA repair in 
the genotoxicity of butadiene-derived epoxides. 
For example, mice deficient in nucleotide exci -
sion-repair are more susceptible than wild-type 
mice to the mutagenic effects of butadiene and 
diepoxybutane ( Wickliffe et al., 2007 ).
The mechanistic link between animal and 
human neoplasia induced by butadiene is supported by the identification in mice of genetic alterations in butadiene-induced tumours that 
are frequently involved in the development of 
a variety of human cancers as well. The K- Ras, 
H-Ras, p53, p16/p15 and β-catenin  mutations detected in tumours in mice probably occurred as a result of the DNA-reactive properties and 
the genotoxic effects of butadiene-derived epox -
ides. A consistent pattern of K- Ras mutations 
(G→C transversion at codon 13) was observed in butadiene-induced cardiac haemangiosarcomas, 
neoplasms of the lung and fore-stomach, and lymphomas ( Hong et al ., 2000 ; Sills et al ., 2001 ; 
Ton et al ., 2007 ). Alterations in the p53  gene in 
mouse-brain tumours were mostly G→A transi -
tion mutations ( Kim et al., 2005 ). Inactivation of 
the tumour-suppressor genes p16  and p15  may 
also be important in the development of buta -
diene-induced lymphomas ( Zhuang et al., 2000 ). 
Mammary gland adenocarcinomas induced by butadiene in mice frequently had mutations in the p53, H- Ras and β-catenin  genes ( Zhuang 
et al ., 2002 ). These observations point to a geno -
toxic mechanism that underlies the develop -
ment of butadiene-induced cancers. Although 
genotoxicity data indicate that diepoxybutane is 
the most genotoxic of the butadiene epoxides, the relative contribution of these metabolic interme -
diates to the mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of butadiene is not known. A comparison of the weight of evidence on metabolism, haemoglobin-
adduct formation and genetic changes in rodents 
and humans exposed to butadiene is summa -
rized in Table 4.1 .
4.5 Synthesis
The numerous studies that have been 
conducted on butadiene toxicokinetics, metabo -
lism, and genotoxicity provide strong evidence that the carcinogenicity of butadiene involves a genotoxic mechanism of action mediated by reac -
tive epoxide metabolites. The metabolic pathways for butadiene in experimental animals have also been demonstrated in humans. This mechanism 
of action is based on the observations that buta -
diene-induced mutagenicity requires metabolic 
activation, and that the DNA-reactive epoxides 
formed during butadiene biotransformation 
3321,3-Butadiene
are direct-acting mutagens ( IARC, 1999 , 2008 ). 
Thus, butadiene metabolism, formation of reac -
tive epoxides, interaction of these epoxides with 
DNA, and resultant mutagenicity are key steps in the mechanism that underlies the carcino -
genicity of this agent.
5. Evaluation
There is sufficient evidence  in humans for the 
carcinogenicity of 1,3-butadiene. 1,3-Butadiene 
causes cancer of the haematolymphatic organs.
There is sufficient evidence  for the carci -
nogenicity of 1,3-butadiene in experimental animals.
There is sufficient evidence  for the carci -
nogenicity of diepoxybutane in experimental animals.
There is strong evidence that the carcino -
genicity of 1,3-butadiene in humans operates by a genotoxic mechanism that involves formation 
of reactive epoxides, interaction of these direct-acting mutagenic epoxides with DNA, and resultant mutagenicity. The metabolic pathways for 1,3-butadiene in experimental animals have also been demonstrated in humans.
1,3-Butadiene is carcinogenic to humans

2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo- para -dioxin 
(TCDD) has no known commercial applications. It occurred as a contaminant in chlorophenoxy 
herbicides, including 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy -
acetic acid (2,4,5-T), which were widely used 
in the 1960s and 1970s to control weeds (e.g. 
on pastureland and food crops) and as a defo -
liant during the Viet Nam war. It is used as a 
research chemical and was tested, but never used 
commercially, as a flame-proofing agent and as a pesticide against insects and wood-destroying 
fungi ( NTP, 20 04 ). TCDD may also be produced 
in thermal processes such as incineration, in 
metal-processing, and in the bleaching of paper 
pulp with free chlorine. The relative amounts of 
the TCDD congeners produced depend on the production or incineration process and vary 
widely ( IARC, 1997 ).
Polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) are 
not manufactured commercially other than for scientific research purposes. Release of PCDF 
into the environment is mainly from combus -
tion and incineration. Based on congener-
specific profiles, combustion sources all produce 
2,3,7,8-substituted polychlorinated dibenzo-para -dioxins (PCDDs) and PCDFs, including 
2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran (PeCDF). The latter substance is the major congener emitted from cement kilns burning hazardous waste 
(approximately 20% of the total congener emis -
sion). Other major sources of PeCDF are metal 
smelting, refining, and processing; chemical 
manufacturing/processing (production of chlo -
rophenols, PCBs, vinyl chloride); pulp bleaching; 
and existing reservoirs that reflect past releases 
(IARC, 1997 ; USEPA, 2000a ).
Mixtures of polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), 
including 3,3
′,4,4′,5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 
126), were produced for commercial purposes during the period 1929–1977 for the electrical 
industry, to be used as dielectric insulating fluids for transformers and capacitors. PCBs 
3402,3,7,8-TCDD, 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF, PCB 126
were also used in hydraulic fluids, plastics, and 
paints. The manufacture and use of PCBs in 
the United States was stopped in 1977 in view 
of increasing amounts of PCB residues in the environment that had accumulated during the 
previous decades. However, PCBs continue to be 
released into the environment through the use and disposal of products containing PCBs, as 
by-products during the manufacture of certain 
organic chemicals, and during combustion of some waste materials ( USEPA, 2000a ). Due to 
their lipophilic nature (log K
ow, 6.5–7.7) and 
resistance to biodegradation, specific PCBs bio-
concentrate and bio-accumulate in the environ -
ment. PCBs are widespread in their distribution 
and are found in virtually all environmental 
compartments including air, soil, water, sedi -
ment, and biota ( USEPA, 2000b ).
1.3 Human exposure
PCDDs are ubiquitous in soil, sediments and 
air. Excluding occupational or accidental expo -
sures, most human exposure to TCDD occurs 
as a result of eating meat, milk, eggs, fish and related products, as TCDD is persistent in the 
environment and accumulates in animal fat. 
Occupational exposures to TCDD at higher levels have occurred since the 1940s as a result of 
production and use of chlorophenols and chloro -
phenoxy herbicides. Even higher exposures have 
occurred sporadically in relation to accidents in 
these industries ( IARC, 1997 ).
Mean background levels of TCDD in human 
tissues are in the range of 2–3 ng/kg (parts per trillion; ppt) fat [because PCDDs are stored in 
fat tissue, body burdens of PCDDs are often expressed as concentration in lipid, e.g. 100 ppt 
lipid]. Available data suggest that these levels have 
decreased three- to fivefold since the late 1970s, when the development of gas chromatography/
mass spectrometry methodology permitted 
these extremely low concentrations of TCDD in tissues and in the environment to be measured accurately for the first time. Similarly, since the mid-1980s, mean tissue concentrations of total 
TCDD in the general population have decreased 
by two- to threefold. Human exposures related to occupation or accidents have led to tissue 
concentrations of TCDD up to several orders 
of magnitude higher than background levels (IARC, 1997 ).
1.3.1 Occupational exposure to dioxins
Because TCDD has never been intentionally 
manufactured for large-scale commercial use, 
estimates of the numbers of workers exposed in 
the past are not available. From the US National Occupational Exposure Survey (1981–1983), it 
was estimated that approximately 14 workers 
were potentially exposed to TCDD in the USA (NIOSH, 1990 ). Historical occupational expo -
sures to TCDD have been reviewed ( IARC, 1997 ).
In a series of studies, Collins et al . (2006 , 
2007 , 2008 ) examined concentrations of TCDD 
in serum from 375 workers in Michigan who had been exposed in the past (26–62 years before) to trichlorophenol and/or pentachlorophenol. 
Workers exposed only to trichlorophenol had 
mean lipid-adjusted TCDD levels of 15.9 ppt, compared with 6.5 ppt in unexposed workers and 
3.3 ppt in community controls. Those exposed 
to pentachlorophenol only had mean TCDD concentrations of 8.0 ppt; workers exposed to 
both chemicals had mean TCDD levels of 13.9 
ppt; and tradesmen with plant-wide responsibili -
ties had mean levels of 20.7 ppt. A follow-up study 
to evaluate the influence of various factors on 
TCDD concentrations in serum of 412 workers exposed to penta- and trichlorophenol, showed 
that age and body fat were important determi -
nants, whereas diet and jobs-outside-the-plant 
had little impact ( Burns et al., 2008 ).
To estimate job-specific exposures over time 
at a facility in New Zealand that manufactured 2,4,5-T along with other products between 
1962 and 1988, Aylward et al . (2010)  integrated 
341IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
available work records, TCDD pharmacoki -
netic data, and serum-sampling data from 346 
workers. Estimated TCDD concentrations in 
serum were below 300 ppt lipid for all individ -
uals in the cohort over the entire study period, 
i.e. lower than estimates for other 2,4,5-T worker 
populations.
McLean et al. (2009)  measured dioxin concen -
trations in serum of 94 randomly selected former sawmill workers (71 exposed to pentachloroph -
enol, 23 non-exposed) in New Zealand, twenty 
years after the use of pentachlorophenol (PCP) 
had ceased. The authors compared age-adjusted dioxin levels in the exposed and non-exposed 
groups, examined the effect of duration and 
intensity of the exposure to PCP, and compared congener profiles with those found in the commer -
cial-grade PCP used at the time. Mean levels in exposed and unexposed workers were 1.88 pg/g (range, 0.51–4.13) and 1.48 pg/g, respectively. 
The congener profiles in serum were consistent 
with those in PCP solutions, and dioxin levels increased with both employment duration and 
estimated exposure intensity.
In a study of Russian workers who manu -
factured phenoxy herbicides and related compounds in the 1960s, workers who handled 
2,4,5-T ( n = 34) had median blood-lipid TCDD 
concentrations of 165.7 ng/kg (parts per trillion), 
with a range from 35 to 1680 ng/kg. Workers who 
manufactured 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D; n = 6) had median levels of 68.9 ng/kg. 
Children of workers who handled 2,4,5,-T ( n = 8) 
and administrative workers ( n  =  5) had higher 
median levels than two control groups drawn 
from the general population ( n = 60): the median 
blood-lipid TCDD concentrations in the chil -
dren and administrative staff were 39.5 and 31.0 ng/kg, respectively, compared with 12 and 
62.4 ng/kg for the two control groups ( Ryan & 
Schecter, 2000 ).
Several exposure-response analyses have been 
performed in the industrial cohorts that served as a basis for the previous IARC Monographs  evaluation ( Becher et al., 1998 ; Flesch-Janys et al., 
1998 ; Hooiveld et al., 1998 ; Steenland et al., 1999 , 
2004 ; Crump et al., 2003 ).
1.3.2 Non-occupational exposure to dioxins
PCDDs, including TCDD, have been measured 
in all environmental compartments including 
ambient air, surface water, groundwater, soil, 
and sediment. While the manufacture and use of chlorinated compounds – chlorophenols, chlo -
rinated phenoxy herbicides – were important sources of PCDD-release into the environment in the past, the restricted manufacture of many 
of these compounds has substantially reduced 
their contribution to environmental pollution. It is now recognized that incineration/combus -
tion processes are the most important sources of PCDDs to the environment ( Zook & Rappe, 
1994 ; ATSDR, 1998).
The identified sources of environmental 
release of TCDDs have been grouped into four major categories: incineration sources (munic -
ipal waste, hospital waste, hazardous waste, sewage sludge), combustion sources (cement kilns, wood-burning, diesel vehicles, coal-fired 
utilities, crematoria), industrial sources (pulp 
and paper mills, chemical manufacturing, metal industry), and reservoir sources (biochemical 
processes, photolytic processes, forest fires, acci -
dental releases) ( Kulkarni et al., 2008 ).
Human exposure to all dioxin-like 
compounds is usually calculated in terms of 
toxic equivalence quotients (TEQs).
Because the various polychlorinated dibenzo-
p-dioxins, polychlorinated dibenzofurans, and polychlorinated biphenyls have different activity levels, a toxic equivalence quotient (TEQ) is calculated by standardizing the indi -
vidual congener levels detected in each sample, multiplying them with the appropriate toxic equivalency factor (TEF), and summing these normalized values. TEFs have been established by the World Health Organization and are calculated relative to 2,3,7,8-TCDD ( Van den 
3422,3,7,8-TCDD, 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF, PCB 126
Berg et al., 2006 ; Charnley & Kimbrough, 2006 ; 
see also Section 4).
The US Environmental Protection Agency 
(USEPA) reported that emissions from quan -
tified sources – waste incineration, pesticide 
manufacture, chlorine bleaching of pulp and paper – in the USA decreased from about 14 000 
g TEQ/year in 1987 to approximately 1500 g 
TEQ/year in 2000 (a 90% reduction). This decline is expected to continue ( Charnley & Kimbrough, 
2006 ; USEPA, 2006 ).
People are exposed to PCDDs primarily 
through foods that are contaminated as a result of 
the accumulation of these substances in the food-
chain and in high-fat foods, such as dairy prod -
ucts, eggs, animal fats, and some fish. Additional 
exposure sources include industrial accidents 
(Baccarelli et al., 2002 ) and several miscellaneous 
exposures ( Yoshimura, 2003 ; Kulkarni et al ., 
2008 ). Because dioxins are fat-soluble, lowering 
the fat content in food can reduce the intake of dioxin. The average adult in the USA has a daily 
TEQ intake of approximately 1 pg/kg, lower 
than a decade ago, whereas a nursing infant has an average TEQ intake of 35–53 pg/kg bw/day 
(Schecter et al ., 1994 ; USEPA, 2004; Schecter 
et al., 2006 ).
Data on TCDD concentrations in lipids have 
been collected over a 30-year period (1970–2000) 
among the general population in the USA, Canada, Germany, and France. Mean lipid-
levels of TCDD steadily decreased nearly 10-fold 
over this time period, with lipid-adjusted TCDD concentratrions of about 2 ppt in the year 2000. 
On the basis of pharmacokinetic modelling, 
mean concentrations of TCDD in the general population are likely to decrease further to 0.5–1 
ppt by 2015, even if intake levels do not decrease 
further ( Aylward & Hays, 2002 ; Hays & Aylward, 
2003 ).
There is evidence from the NHANES serum 
PCDD/F data (including TCDD) that concentra -
tions of these compounds in the US population are 
declining. Median serum-lipid concentrations (population-weighted) of PCDDs/Fs were 13.46, 
13.98 and 11.39 TEQ/g lipid for 1999–2000 
(n = 1271), 2001–2002 ( n = 1244), and 2003–2004 
(n  =  1290), respectively. When the temporal 
trends are examined by age, median levels appear to have declined in the younger part of the popu -
lation and remained essentially constant (or have 
slightly increased) in the older part ( LaKind 
et al., 2009 ).
Several exposure studies have shown that 
some US Viet Nam veterans who were exposed to 
Agent Orange had serum TCDD levels up to 600 
ppt in lipid many years after they had left Viet Nam, compared with values of approximately 1–2 
ppt of TCDD for the general population ( Kahn 
et al ., 1988 ; Schecter et al ., 1990 , 1992 ; Michalek 
et al ., 1995 ). In Viet Nam, TCDD levels up to 
1 000 000 ppt have been found in soil or sedi -
ment from Agent Orange-contaminated areas 
3–4 decades after spraying. In addition, elevated 
concentrations have been measured in food and 
wildlife in Viet Nam ( Olie et al ., 1989 ) as well as 
in Vietnamese people from contaminated areas 
(Schecter et al ., 2001 , 2002 , 2003 ; Dwernychuk 
et al., 2002 ; Schecter et al., 2006 ).
Bates et al. (2004)  determined persistent orga -
nochlorines, including TCDD, in serum of the 
non-occupationally exposed New Zealand popu -
lation in 1996–1997. The weighted mean concen -
tration of TCDD in adult New Zealanders was 2.3 ng/kg lipid weight basis (range, < 1–7.0 ng/kg). The age group-specific data showed a trend 
towards higher concentrations in the older age 
groups.
Several recent studies have assessed and 
reviewed the exposure to and intake of dioxins, including TCDD, from dietary sources ( Liem 
et al ., 2000 ; Tsutsumi et al ., 2001 ; Huwe, 2002 ; 
Parzefall, 2002 ; Baars et al ., 2004 ; Charnley & 
Doull, 2005 ; Nakatani et al., 2005 ; Larsen, 2006 ; 
Sasamoto et al ., 2006 ; Gies et al ., 2007 ; Toda ka 
et al., 2008 ).
343IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
1.3.3 Human exposure to polychlorinated 
dibenzofurans, polychlorinated 
biphenyls and dioxin-like compounds
Due to high lipophilicity and low solubility in 
aqueous media, polychlorinated dibenzofurans 
(PCDFs) accumulate in the fat tissue of animals. 
The highest concentrations of PCDFs are found in fish, meat, eggs, and dairy products ( Schecter 
et al ., 1994 ; USEPA, 2000b ). This results in 
widespread exposure of the general population to PCDFs and related dioxin-like compounds, 
with an estimated 90% of human exposure due 
to ingestion of contaminated food, and a small fraction via inhalation and dermal absorption.
Human exposure to all dioxin-like 
compounds is usually calculated in terms of TEQs (see definition above). Adult daily intake 
of dioxin-like compounds including PCDDs, 
PCDFs and dioxin-like PCBs from all sources is estimated to be approximately 70pg TEQ/day, 
where TEQ reflects the potency-adjusted amount 
of all dioxin-like compounds. The intake from all sources of PCDDs and PCDFs is estimated to be 
45pg TEQ/day and intake from dioxin-like PCBs 
is 25pg TEQ/day. Approximately 90% of the daily intake is from food sources (40pg TEQ/day 
for PCDDs and PCDFs and 22pg TEQ/day for 
dioxin-like PCBs). Intake of PeCDF from food is approximately 6.6 pg per day and represents 
16% of the total intake of PCDDs and PCDFs 
on a TEQ basis. This level of exposure together with the long half-life of dioxin-like compounds 
in humans leads to persistent body burdens in 
humans in the range of 25 pg TEQ/g lipid ( USEPA, 
2000b ). Depending upon dietary practice and 
proximity to specific sources of exposure, some populations may have higher exposure or body burdens. In contrast to the general population, 
several specific groups may have been exposed to 
much higher levels of PeCDF as a result of occu -
pational exposure. In European tissue samples, 
PeCDF levels are on average 13 ppt TEQ (lipid-
adjusted) and represent approximately 36% of the TEQ contributed by PCDDs and PCDFs. PeCDF is the highest contributor of the PCDF 
class of DLCs to the total TEQ, based on both 
intake levels and tissue concentrations.
The majority (90%) of ambient human expo -
sure to dioxin-like compounds occurs through the ingestion of food containing PCB residues. Levels of PCB 126 in food range from 0.05 to 
0.83 pg/g. Human exposure to all dioxin-like 
compounds is usually calculated in terms of toxic equivalents (TEQs). On a TEQ basis, it is esti -
mated that humans are exposed via food to 22 pg TEQ/day (for a 70-kg person) from dioxin-like PCBs of which PCB 126 (13 pg/day) accounts for 
60% of the TEQ intake. Bioaccumulation of PCBs 
results in persistent levels of these substances in human tissues. With an average concentration of 
12 pg TEQ/g lipid, PCB 126 accounts for approxi -
mately half of the PCB TEQ in human tissues 
(USEPA, 2000b ).
2. Cancer in Humans
Human exposures related to occupation or 
accidents have led to tissue concentrations of 
2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo- para -dioxin (TCDD) 
that are 10–100-fold higher than average back -
ground levels in the 1980s. The highest expo -
sures occurred in industrial cohorts of workers 
producing phenoxy herbicides and chlorophe -
nols, while exposure to professional sprayers of 
these compounds was considerably lower. It has 
been shown that TCDD levels in professional applicators increase considerably above back -
ground only after several years of spraying of TCDD-contaminated chemicals. For example, in the most heavily exposed applicators of 2,4,5-T 
in New Zealand, who applied this chemical 
for at least 180 months, the estimated mean serum concentration of TCDD at the time of 
blood drawing was 53 ng/kg ( Smith et al., 1992 ). 
3442,3,7,8-TCDD, 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF, PCB 126
Occasional spraying is unlikely to lead to any 
measurable increase in TCDD level.
The evaluation of the evidence of carcino -
genicity of TCDD was based on studies with direct measurements of TCDD and studies 
involving heavy exposure to herbicides likely 
to be contaminated with TCDD. There are numerous studies that assessed dioxins, furans 
and polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) in workers, but 
these are not systematically reviewed here. These studies indicate that the highest exposure occurs 
in industrial settings producing 2,4,5-T. There 
are also numerous studies in workers evaluating a wide range of health effects. Table 2.1 (available 
at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/
vol100F/100F-22-Table2.1.pdf ) shows estimated 
exposures to TCDD in industrial workers, in workers handling and spraying 2,4,5-T and in the 
population in Seveso, Italy. Average exposures in industrial workers are the highest. The effects of 
TCDD and those of the products in which it was 
found cannot be separated in most of the epide -
miological studies; however, the focus here is on 
the contaminant. The most important studies for 
the evaluation of the carcinogenicity of TCDD are cohort studies of herbicide producers, one 
each in the United States ( Fingerhut et al ., 1991 ; 
Steenland et al ., 1999 , 2001 ), the Netherlands 
(Bueno de M esquita et al ., 1993 ; Hooiveld et al ., 
1998 ; Boers et al . 2010 ), two in Germany ( Manz 
et al., 1991 ; Ott et al., 1993 ; Flesch-Janys et al., 1995 , 
1998 ; Becher et al., 1996 ), and one cohort of resi -
dents in a contaminated area from Seveso, Italy 
(Bertazzi et al., 2001 ; Pesatori et al., 2009 ). These 
studies involve the highest exposures to TCDD 
among all epidemiological studies, although the 
exposures at Seveso were lower and the follow-up was shorter than those in the industrial settings. 
In addition, the multicountry cohort study from 
IARC ( Saracci et al., 1991 ; Kogevinas et al., 1995 , 
1997 ) is of special interest because it includes 
three of four high-exposure cohorts and other industrial cohorts, many of them not reported in separate publications, as well as information on professional applicators. Most of the industrial cohort studies include analyses of subcohorts 
considered to have the highest exposure and/or 
longest latency. These cohorts and their respec -
tive high-exposure subcohorts are the focus 
of this evaluation. In reporting the findings, 
preference has been given to the most updated follow-up, unless earlier publications presented 
evidence not included in a later publication, e.g. 
results by exposure classifications of interest. Results are presented in Table  2.2 (available at 
http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/
vol100F/100F-22-Table2.2.pdf ), Table  2.3 
(available at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/

Table  2.4 (available at http://monographs.

http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/
vol100F/100F-22-Table2.5.pdf ). Additional 
studies of herbicide applicators, both cohort and case–control studies, which have considerably lower exposures to TCDD, are not considered 
critical for the evaluation and are not reported in 
the tables. Among the studies not included, there are several that have been widely quoted and that 
have been important in responding to concerns 
in the community and in raising public aware -
ness regarding potential effects of dioxin expo -
sure, such as Ketchum & Aktar (1996) , Ketchum 
et al. (1999) , and Hardell & Sandström (1979) .
2.1 Description of the most

2.1.1 US NIOSH cohort
The largest study of production workers in 
the US exposed to PCDDs was conducted by the 
National Institute for Occupational Safety and 
Health (NIOSH) and published by Fingerhut et 
al. (1991)  and Steenland et al . (1999 , 2001 ). This 
12-plant cohort study included most workers in the USA likely to have been exposed to TCDD 
345IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
in chemical manufacturing, comprising 5000 
men with work records showing assignment to 
a production or maintenance job in a process 
involving TCDD contamination. Serum levels of TCDD in 253 cohort members at two plants 
measured in 1987 averaged 233 ng/g lipid, 
compared with 7 ng/g lipid in a group of 79 unex -
posed workers. Levels increased to 418 ng/kg for 
119 workers exposed for more than one year. 
Estimates of TCDD exposure were based on occupational records, on an exposure matrix 
based on industrial hygiene measurements, 
and on modelling based on measured TCDD in serum samples. A series of publications on two 
separate plants were available ( Zack & Suskind, 
1980 ; Zack & Gaffey, 1983 ; Cook et al., 1986 ; Ott 
et al., 1987 ; Bond et al., 1989 ; Collins et al., 1993 ).
2.1.2  German accident cohort
In the 1953 accident at the 2,4,5-trichlo -
rophenol (TCP) production unit of BASF at Ludwigshafen, Germany, the total number of 
employees identified as being involved directly or in the subsequent clean-up, repair or main -
tenance activities was 247 (243 men, 4 women). Analyses of adipose tissue and blood from groups of these workers were conducted. Part of 
the cohort was first studied by Thiess et al. (1982)  
and was completed by Ott & Zober (1996) .
2.1.3  IARC multicountry study
An international cohort of workers exposed 
to phenoxy herbicides and chlorophenols was set up by the International Agency for Research on 
Cancer, France ( Saracci et al ., 1991 ). The cohort 
included 16 863 men and 1527 women employed 
in production or spraying, distributed among 20 
cohorts from ten countries. Exposure assessment was based on plant-production records collected 
in each factory through questionnaires and on 
detailed individual job histories. Two nested case–control studies of soft-tissue sarcoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma were conducted by Kogevinas et al. (1995) . The international cohort 
studied by Saracci et al . (1991)  was updated 
and expanded with the data of Fingerhut et al . 
(1991) , Becher et al . (1996) , and Kogevinas et al . 
(1997) . TCDD was measured in serum samples 
for workers in Germany, the Netherlands and the USA. Results from cohorts in specific countries 
have been published separately ( Coggon et al ., 
1991 ; Lynge, 1993 ).
2.1.4  German cohorts
Several reports have considered workers 
from a chemical plant operated by Boehringer-Ingelheim, Hamburg, Germany. This plant 
produced herbicides heavily contaminated with TCDD and other PCDDs/PCDFs ( Manz et al ., 
1991 ; Flesch-Janys et al., 1995 , 1998 ; Becher et al., 
1996 ). In the latter study, workers from three 
other German plants were also considered. 
TCDD analyses were done on serum samples 
from the workers in the Boehringer-Ingelheim cohort.
2.1.5 Dutch cohorts
The mortality of two cohorts of workers 
employed between 1955 and 1986 in the synthesis 
and formulation of phenoxy herbicides and chlo -
rophenols in the Netherlands has been studied 
(Bueno de M esquita et al ., 1993 ). In one of the 
plants (A), where the production was focused on 2,4,5-T and derivatives, an accident in 1963 caused a release of PCDDs, including TCDD. 
Serum samples have been analysed for the pres -
ence of TCDD. The study has been updated 
(Hooiveld et al., 1998 ; Boers et al., 2010 )
2.1.6 Seveso population exposed during an 
industrial accident
On 10 July 1976, a runaway reaction led to 
a blow-out of a TCP-production reactor at the 
ICMESA plant at Seveso, ltaly. The chemical cloud 
3462,3,7,8-TCDD, 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF, PCB 126
that was released from the reactor contained a 
substantial amount of TCDD. The contaminated 
area was subdivided into Zones A and B, and 
Zone R in descending order of TCDD contami -
nation in the soil. The mortality and cancer inci -
dence in the population of Seveso exposed during this industrial accident were investigated. The exposed and referent populations were followed-
up as if they belonged to a unique cohort, blind 
to the exposure status of the subjects. The follow-up after 20 years was > 99% successful ( Bertazzi 
et al., 2001 ; Pesatori et al., 2009 )
2.2 All cancers combined
An increased risk for all cancers combined 
was found in the industrial cohort studies cited 
above in the USA, Germany, and the Netherlands 
and to a lesser extent in the international cohort (see Table  2.2, online). The magnitude of the 
increase is generally small. It is higher in subco -
horts considered to have the heaviest TCDD 
exposure, e.g. the chloracne subcohort in the 
NIOSH study. Furthermore, statistically signifi -
cant positive dose–response trends for all cancers 
combined were present in the NIOSH cohort and 
in the largest and most heavily exposed German 
cohort. A positive trend ( P = 0.05) was also seen 
in the smaller German cohort where an accident 
occurred with release of large amounts of TCDD. 
However, the positive trend in this cohort was limited to smokers. Cumulative dose in these trend 
analyses was estimated by combining data from 
TCDD concentrations in blood and information on job categories, work processes and calendar 
time of exposure. A metanalysis of data from 
three cohorts occupationally exposed to TCDD and related compounds (NIOSH, Boehringer-
Ingelheim, Germany, and BASF, Germany) 
found a statistically significant ( P = 0.02) trend in 
total cancer mortality with increasing exposure 
to dioxin ( Crump et al ., 2003 ). The trend tests 
show an increase in total cancers at cumulative 
TEQ – a metric TCDD-like compounds that is defined here as the amount of TCDD that would produce the same toxicity as a mixture of TCDD-like compounds – serum levels that would result 
from lifetime intake of 7 pg TEQ/kg body weight/
day. A linear dose–response provided a good fit to the combined data. There was no overall 
increase of cancer in the population in Seveso, 
with only minor increases observed for all-cancer mortality and incidence at 15 or more years since 
the accident in the most heavily exposed zones. 
[The overall increase identified in all industrial cohorts, and the positive trends with increased 
exposure that are based on internal compari -
sons, reinforce an overall positive association 
between all cancers combined and exposure to 
TCDD, making it less likely that the increase is 
explained by confounding, either by smoking or by other exposures to carcinogens in the indus -
trial setting.]
2.3 Cancer of the lung
An increased risk for lung cancer was observed 
in the industrial cohort studies, especially in the 
more highly exposed subcohorts (see Table 2.3, 
online). The relative risk for lung cancer in the highly exposed subcohorts was around 1.5 in 
several studies. [It is possible that relative risks 
of this order for lung cancer could result from confounding by smoking, but this would only 
be the case if there were a pronounced differ -
ence in smoking habits between the exposed and 
the referent populations, a difference that seems 
unlikely. Therefore, confounding by smoking 
can probably not explain all the excess risk for lung cancer, although it could explain part 
of it. It is also possible that other occupational 
carcinogens, many of which would affect the lung, are causing some confounding.] In Seveso, 
increased mortality and cancer incidence for 
lung cancer was observed at more than 15 years since the accident.

2.4 Soft-tissue sarcoma
An association between soft-tissue sarcoma 
and spraying of phenoxy herbicides was first 
suggested by results from case–control studies 
in Umea, Sweden ( Hardell & Sandström, 1979 ). 
Exposure to TCDD in these and other commu -
nity-based case–control studies is, however, not accurately estimated. An excess risk for soft-tissue sarcoma, based on a small number of 
deaths, has been reported in the largest industrial 
cohorts, specifically those of NIOSH and IARC (see Table  2.4, online). In both, the mortality 
ratios (SMRs) tended to be higher among the 
most exposed subcohorts. Incidence data for soft-tissue sarcoma were generally not available. 
A dose–response relationship, with estimated 
exposure to TCDD, was found in a case–control study nested in the IARC cohort; however, strong 
positive trends were also found with exposure 
estimates for 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid 
(2,4,5-T). In Seveso, there were no cases of soft-
tissue sarcoma in the most heavily contaminated Zones A and B. [Soft-tissue sarcomas are subject 
to serious misclassification on death certificates. 
Although it is unlikely that this occurs differ -
entially in the exposed and the referent popula -
tions, re-classification of a few cases would have important consequences on results based on small numbers.]
2.5 Non-Hodgkin lymphoma
An increased risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma 
was found in most of the populations studied 
in the four industrial cohort studies and in the 
Seveso population, although the relative risks were mostly non-significant and below 2 (see 
Table  2.5, online). A case–control study nested 
in the IARC cohort provided weak evidence of a dose–response relationship with estimated 
exposure to TCDD. [Although it is plausible that 
other chemicals cause non-Hodgkin lymphoma, strong potential confounding factors are not known. The lack of complete consistency among the cohorts and the weak effect detected in most 
of the positive studies, however, caution against 
a causal interpretation of the findings.]
2.6 Other cancers
Increased risks for several other malignant 
neoplasms have been sporadically reported 
among workers exposed to TCDD, and at 
Seveso. Most notable are risks for breast and rectal cancers and myeloid leukaemia in Seveso, 
bladder cancer in the NIOSH and Dutch cohorts, 
multiple myeloma in the NIOSH cohort, cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx in the German 
cohorts, genital cancers in the Dutch cohort, and 
kidney cancer in the IARC cohort. [The avail -
able results are not fully consistent, and several 
studies have not reported the results for each 
individual cancer site.]
2.7 Synthesis
Overall, the strongest evidence for the carci -
nogenicity of TCDD is for all cancers combined, 
rather than for any specific site. The relative risk for 
all cancers combined in the most highly exposed and longer-latency subcohorts is around 1.4. In 
dose–response analyses, higher relative risks are 
observed for the groups with the highest meas -
ured and modelled exposure to TCDD. This rela -
tive risk for all neoplasms does not appear likely to be explained by confounding, particularly since dose–response was typically based on internal 
comparisons among workers of the same cohort. 
The evidence for specific cancers is strongest for lung cancer, soft-tissue sarcoma and non-
Hodgkin lymphoma, but confounding cannot be 
ruled out for lung cancer, while the findings on soft-tissue sarcoma are based on small numbers. 
Several studies identified statistically significant 
increases in many cancers, but findings for other 
3482,3,7,8-TCDD, 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF, PCB 126
cancers including major cancers are, overall, 
inconsistent between studies. It should be borne 
in mind that the general population is exposed 
to levels that are much lower than those experi -
enced by the industrial populations.
The Working Group did not review the epide -
miological evidence of other PCDDs, PCDFs or PCBs with a dioxin-like activity.
3. Cancer in Experimental Animals
3.1 2,3,7 ,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo- para -
dioxin
Carcinogenicity studies with several strains 
of rats, mice and Syrian hamsters treated with 
2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo- para -dioxin (TCDD) 
via the oral route (gavage or diet), by intra-peri -
toneal injection, or by skin application have been reviewed in IARC Monograph  Volume 69 ( IARC, 
1997 ). At the time, the review of the available 
data led to the conclusion that there is sufficient evidence  in experimental animals for the carci -
nogenicity of TCDD. The present Monograph  
also evaluates relevant carcinogenicity studies in TCDD-treated experimental animals that were 
published since 1997. The results of adequately conducted carcinogenicity studies are summa -
rized below and in Table 3.1 and Table 3.2 .
TCDD was tested for carcinogenicity by oral 
administration (gavage or dose feed) in four 
studies in mice and six studies in rats, by skin 
(topical) application in two studies in mice, by intraperitoneal injection in one study in mice, one 
study in rats and one study in hamsters and by 
subcutaneous injection in one study in hamsters. TCDD produced tumours in both sexes of mice 
and rats, and in multiple organs and tissues.
Oral administration of TCDD caused 
increased incidences of thyroid follicular adenomas and hepatocellular adenomas and 
carcinomas in male and female mice, of alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas and carcinomas in male mice, and of histiocytic lymphomas and subcu -
taneous fibrosarcomas in female mice. In rats, it caused increased incidences of hepatocellular adenomas in males and females, cholangiocarci -
nomas and hepatocellular carcinomas in females, lung cystic keratinizing epitheliomas and squamous-cell carcinomas in females, adrenal 
gland (cortex) adenomas and squamous-cell 
carcinomas of the hard palate/nasal turbinates in males and females, tongue squamous-cell 
carcinomas and thyroid follicular adenomas and 
carcinomas combined in males, subcutaneous fibromas in males and subcutaneous fibrosa -
rcomas in females, and pituitary adenomas, uterine and oral mucosa (gingival) squamous-cell carcinomas and pancreatic adenomas and carci -
nomas combined in females ( Van Miller et al ., 
1977 ; Kociba et al ., 1978 ; Tóth et al ., 1979 , NTP, 
1982a , 2006a ; Della Porta et al ., 1987 ; Goodman 
& Sauer, 1992 ; Hays et al., 1997 , Yoshizawa et al., 
2005 ). Skin application or gavage caused benign 
and malignant tumours of the skin in female mice 
including transgenic mice ( NTP, 1982b ; Wyde 
et al ., 2004 ). Hamsters that received TCDD by 
intraperitoneal or subcutaneous injection devel -
oped squamous-cell carcinomas of the facial 
skin ( Rao et al ., 1988 ). Intraperitoneal injection 
caused increased incidence of hepatocellular 
adenomas and carcinomas in female mice and 
of lymphomas in male and female mice ( Della 
Porta et al., 1987 ).
Several studies in mice showed that admin -
istration of TCDD with known carcinogens enhanced the incidence of skin papillomas, lung 
adenomas, liver adenomas and hepatoblastomas. 
In female rats, TCDD co-administered with various nitrosamines enhanced the incidence 
of focal hepatic lesions. In one study, TCDD 
enhanced the incidence of lung carcinomas in ovariectomized female rats following administra -
tion of N -nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) ( IARC, 
1997 ). In two more recent studies in female rats, 
TCDD given orally or subcutaneously enhanced

NDEA ( Davis et al., 2000 ; Viluksela et al., 2000 ). In

anthracene-induced mammary-gland tumours 
in offspring ( Brown et al., 1998 ; see Table 3.3 ).
3.2 Dioxin-like compounds
3.2.1  2,3,4,7 ,8-Pentachlorodibenzofuran
Oral administration of 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlo -
rodibenzofuran (PeCDF) resulted in significant dose-dependent trends for increased incidence 
of cholangiocarcinomas and hepatocellular adenomas ( Walker et al., 2005 ; NTP, 20 06b ). (see 
Table 3.4 )
Skin application of PeCDF after a single 
dose of N -methyl -N
′-nitro- N-nitrosoguanidine 
resulted in an increased incidence of skin papil -
lomas in mice ( Hébert et al., 1990 ). Subcutaneous 
injections of PeCDF after oral treatment with NDEA resulted in an increased multiplicity of 
hepatocellular carcinomas and liver hyperplastic 
nodules in male rats ( Nishizumi & Masuda, 1986 ). 
Subcutaneous injections of PeCDF after a single 
intraperitoneal injection of NDEA increased the 
number of focal hepatic lesions in female rats (Waern et al., 1991 ).
3.2.2  3,3′,4,4′,5-Pentachlorobiphenyl
Oral administration of 3,3 ′,4,4′,5-pentachlo -

cholangiocarcinomas, lung cystic keratinizing epitheliomas, and oral mucosa (gingiva) squa -
mous-cell carcinomas in female rats ( Walker 
et al., 2005 ; NTP, 2006c ).4. Other Relevant Data
4.1 AhR activation
Most, if not all of the effects of TCDD are 
related to its binding to and activation of the 
aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a member of 
the basic helix–loop–helix/Per-Arnt-Sim family of transcription factors. This receptor was first 
identified in mouse liver ( Poland et al ., 1976 ) 
where it showed high affinity towards TCDD. 
Further studies found that AhR is expressed in 
most mammalian tissues and that many other 
halogenated aromatic compounds can bind this receptor, including the coplanar polychlorinated 
biphenyls and the polychlorinated dibenzodi -
oxins and dibenzofurans. It is generally proposed 
that the toxic and carcinogenic effects of dioxin 
and other halogenated compounds are due to their 
high affinity to AhR, and to the sustained pleio -
tropic response from a battery of genes – many 
of which encode drug-metabolizing enzymes – 
that follows the receptor-ligand complex forma -
tion (Mandal, 2005; Walker, 2007 ). Much of the 
research in the three decades since the discovery of the AhR has focused on dissecting this pleio -
tropic response to fully understand the mecha -
nisms involved in dioxin-mediated toxicity.
The free AhR resides in the cytoplasm as an 
inactive complex containing a heat-shock protein 
dimer, Hsp90, XAP2 and p23 ( Meyer et al ., 
1998 ). When the AhR binds to a ligand, XAP2 is 
released and, through a conformational change, the complex is moved to the nucleus where the 
Hsp90 dimer dissociates and the AhR-nuclear-translocator (ARNT) binds to the PAS domains 
of the receptor. The activated AhR/ARNT 
complex forms a heterodimer that is then capable 
of binding to the 5
′-regulatory region of dioxin-
responsive genes ( Mimura & Fujii-Kuriyama, 
2003 ). The primary targets following activation 
of AhR include genes encoding many phase-I 
and phase-II metabolic enzymes (e.g. CYP1A1 , 
365IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
CYP1A2 , CYP1B1 , NQO1 , UGT1A2 , GSTA1  
and ALDH3A1 ) (Nebert et al ., 2000 ; Schwarz & 
Appel, 2005 ). However, through direct and indi -
rect pathways, TCDD is able to alter the expres -
sions of a much larger number of genes ( Martinez 
et al., 2002 ; Dere et al., 2006 ; Pastorelli et al., 2006 ; 
Schwanekamp et al ., 2006 ). In addition, there is 
cross-talk with several other receptor-mediated 
systems including the estrogen receptor ( Safe & 
Wormke, 2003 ) and the retinoic-acid receptor β 
(Lu et al ., 1994 ; Berkers et al ., 1995 ; Toyoshiba 
et al., 2004 ).
Despite the strong conservation of the AhR 
across species, gene polymorphisms, differences in co-activators and differences in downstream 
signalling following activation are all likely to modulate TCDD carcinogenicity ( Ema et al ., 
1994 ; Tuomisto et al ., 1999 ). These factors could 
explain the interindividual differences observed in the magnitude of the carcinogenic response 
after exposure to TCDD. For example, different 
AhR polymorphisms triggered a threefold differ -
ence in EROD activity in human lymphocytes 
(Smart & Daly, 2000 ).
4.2 Mechanisms of carcinogenicity
TCDD is not directly genotoxic and the 
tumorigenic activity is likely to be due to a fairly long half-life, especially in humans, resulting in 
a sustained activation of the AhR. TCDD half-life in the human body is estimated at 7.2 years 
(Milbrath et al ., 2009 ); long half-life in the envi -
ronment and the ability to bio-accumulate in the 
food-chain are also reported ( IARC, 1997 ). The 
sustained downstream signalling may trigger an adaptive biochemical and physiological response in the cell that can promote carcinogenesis 
(Biegel & Safe, 1990 ; Lu et al., 1994 ; Berkers et al., 
1995 ; Schwarz & Appel, 2005 ), also by inducing 
mutations ( Stohs et al ., 1990 ; Tritscher et al ., 
1996 ; Shertzer et al ., 1998 ; Yoshida & Ogawa, 
2000 ; Thornton et al ., 2001 ; Nebert et al ., 2004 ; 
Knerr et al ., 2006 ; Schlezinger et al ., 2006 ; Lin et al ., 2007 ; Green et al ., 2008 ). TCDD may also 
enhance – although it sometimes inhibits – the progression and invasiveness of initiated tumours 
(Marlowe & Puga, 2005 ; Peng et al ., 2009 ), but 
this topic will not be discussed in detail here.
The primary mechanism by which TCDD is 
thought to cause cancer is by altering the cellular ability to proliferate, migrate, apoptose, senesce 
and terminally differentiate ( Safe, 2001 ; Marlowe 
& Puga, 2005 ; Ray & Swanson, 2009 ) in a multi -
step process focused on the accumulation of mutations and/or heritable epigenetic changes. 
Chemicals that inhibit apoptosis and increase proliferation usually increase cancer risk as 
well. TCDD has been shown to increase cellular 
proliferation both in vivo  and in vitro  in several 
tissues ( Maronpot et al., 1993 ; Barrett, 1995 ; Dere 
et al ., 2006 ) possibly through interactions with 
protein-kinase C signalling ( Barrett, 1995 ), inhi -
bition of senescence ( Ray & Swanson, 2009 ) or 
activation of growth-signalling factors ( Kohn, 
1995 ). In initiation-promotion models, TCDD 
expanded the populations of preneoplastic 
foci in rat liver ( Dragan et al ., 1992 ; Maronpot 
et al ., 1993 ; Tritscher et al ., 1995 ) and promoted 
carcinogenesis in liver, skin and lung in rodents (DiGiovanni et al ., 1977 ; Hébert et al ., 1990 ; 
Lucier et al ., 1991 ; Dragan et al ., 1992 ; Beebe 
et al., 1995 ; Tritscher et al., 1995 ; Tritscher et al., 
2000 ).
Finally, TCDD may upregulate drug-metabo-
lizing enzymes, thus increasing the presence of highly reactive intermediates that form during 
metabolic activation and/or transformation of several key hormones. For example, CYP1A1, 
CYP1A2 and CYP1B1 induction is a major 
source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) forma -
tion in hepatocytes and this has been linked to 
the decoupling of the P450 catalytic cycle ( Nebert 
et al ., 2004 ; Knerr et al ., 2006 ; Schlezinger et al ., 
2006 ; Green et al ., 2008 ). A hormonal linkage 
with estrogen has been demonstrated through 
the increase in 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine (a marker of oxidative stress) in the liver of intact female 
3662,3,7,8-TCDD, 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF, PCB 126
rats compared with rats that are ovariectomized 
before exposure to TCDD ( Tritscher et al., 1996 ). 
TCDD may induce prolonged oxidative stress, and consequent DNA damage and mutations, also in several other strains of rats and mice, 
and in cell lines ( Stohs et al ., 1990 ; Shertzer 
et al ., 1998 ; Yoshida & Ogawa, 2000 ; Thornton 
et al ., 2001 ; Wyde et al ., 2001 ; Lin et al ., 2007 ). 
TCDD is a complete carcinogen in mice and rats 
in multiple strains ( IARC, 1997 ; NTP, 20 06a ); see 
Section 3).
TCDD thus may both promote and initiate 
carcinogenesis through indirect oxidative stress, leading some to refer to dioxin as an activator of 
carcinogenesis and to adopt initiation-promotion 
models to better explain the toxicity of TCDD and better fit pre-neoplastic and neoplastic 
data ( Portier & Kohn, 1996 ; Portier et al ., 1996 ; 
Luebeck et al., 2000 ).
4.3 Dioxin-like compounds
As noted above, the carcinogenicity of 
TCDD is tied to a sustained, pleiotropic response following exposure to dioxin. The 17 
laterally-substituted (2,3,7,8-substituted) poly -
chlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDD-Ls), the 
coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls (CP-PCBs) 
and the 17 laterally-substituted polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDF-Ls) are all structurally 
and toxicologically inter-related halogenated 
aromatic hydrocarbons referred to as dioxin-like compounds (DLCs). They potentially induce 
pleiotropic responses in cells very similar to 
those induced by TCDD ( IARC, 1978 , 1987 , 1997 ; 
Vezina et al ., 2004 ) as they are all able to bind 
to the AhR. Binding affinity is different among DLCs, with some of them having so little binding affinity that there is almost no information on 
their biological impact. We focus here on the 28 
DLCs (DLC-28) listed in Table  4.1  that produce 
a TCDD-like response in human cell lines ( Endo 
et al., 2003 ), in animal and primary human cells, 
and in animal and human tissue ( Vezina et al ., 2004 ; Silkworth et al ., 2005 ; Kopec et al ., 2008 ; 
N’Jai et al., 2008 ).
DLCs co-occur in virtually every environ -
mental compartment where they are found, and assessment of their potential effect on human risk 
can be complicated. Public health authorities (in 
particular WHO expert panels) have developed the toxicity equivalence factor (TEF) method -
ology for measuring the potency of DLCs, with TCDD as the index chemical. Exposures are calculated as a simple weighted sum of the indi -
vidual amounts multiplied by their individual TEFs to yield the equivalent dose in units of TCDD exposure. Only the compounds of the 
DLC-28 series have TEF values > 0 ( Table  4.1 ), 
all of the remaining congeners have TEF = 0.
WHO recently evaluated TEFs ( Van den 
Berg et al ., 2006 ) thus reviewing much of the 
literature on DLCs ( Haws et al ., 2006 ), namely 
189 studies with over 1000 targets used for anal -
ysis. For every compound, there is at least one 
in vitro  study showing AhR binding and one 
showing 7-ethoxyresorufin- O-dethylase activity, 
which is associated with an increase in CYP1A1 activity. Congeners 1,2,3,7,8-PeCDD, 2,3,7,8-TCDF, 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF, and PCB-77, -126, and 
-169 have a very broad spectrum of information 
both in animal and in human cells, demon -
strating activity consistent with the mechanisms 
described earlier. In addition, for PCB-81 there 
are nine studies in human cell lines showing the same alterations in gene expression and enzyme 
activity as reported for TCDD.
Congeners 1,2,3,7,8-pentaCDD, 
1,2,3,4,6,7,8-heptaCDD, a mixture of 1,2,3,6,7,8- 
and 1,2,3,7,8,9-hexaCDD, and a mixture of 
PCDDs have been studied in two-stage experi -
mental models ( IARC, 1978 ) and shown to 
enhance the carcinogenic potential of known carcinogens just like TCDD. There are some 
human studies on the compounds in the DLC-28 series, but they have either poor exposure char -
acterization or also contain TCDD, making 
367IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
it difficult to interpret their individual effects 
(IARC, 1978 ).
While the carcinogenicity of TCDD has been 
clearly established in rodents, for the remaining compounds in the DLC-28 series bioassays on 
two-year chronic exposure are lacking. A two-
year chronic study on 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF in rodents 
(NTP, 20 06b ) demonstrated tumour effects 
consistent with those seen for TCDD (hepatocel -
lular adenomas, cholangiocarcinomas, gingival squamous cell carcinomas, and an equivocal 
finding of lung cystic keratonizing epitheliomas). When compared for potency, the result from this study agreed with the TEF concept ( Walker et al., 
2005 ). 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF and 1,2,3,4,7,8-HxCDF 
were also enhanced tumorigenesis in two-stage studies of cancer ( IARC, 1997 ). Follow-up of 
populations in Taiwan, China ( Tsai et al ., 2007 ) 
and Japan ( Onozuka et al ., 2009 ) accidentally 
exposed to rice-oil containing PCDFs and PCBs, 
shows a significantly increased risk of mortality 
from chronic liver disease in men and a non-significant increase from liver cancer in men 
and women in Taiwan, China while in Japan 
all cancer mortality, and liver and lung cancer-mortalities were increased in men.

The carcinogenicity of mixtures of PCBs in 
rodents has also been clearly established through 
studies of various Aroclors ( IARC, 1978 ; Mayes 
et al., 1998 ; NTP, 2006c ) yielding predominantly 
liver cancers ( Cogliano, 1998 ). Two-year chronic 
exposure studies done by the US National 
Toxicology Program (NTP) on PCB 126 ( NTP, 
2006d ) and PCB 118 ( NTP, 2009 ), demonstrated 
tumour effects consistent with those seen for TCDD (hepatocellular adenomas, cholangiocar -
cinomas, gingival squamous cell carcinomas, 
and lung cystic keratonizing epitheliomas). 
Moreover, when equivalent TCDD doses where applied with the current TEF, a carcinogenic 
response equivalent to that predicted for TCDD 
from the NTP study ( Walker et al ., 2005 ) was 
observed.
The set of DLC-28 ( IARC, 1978 , 1997 ; 
Milbrath et al., 2009 ) have a long half-life similar 
to that of TCDD (estimated at 7.2  years in the 
human body) ( Table  4.1 ). Many congeners have 
similar or longer half-lives (1,2,3,7,8-PeCDD, 
1,2,3,4,7,8- and 1,2,3,6,7,8-HxCDD, 1,2,3,6,7,8- 
and 1.2.3.7.8.9-HxCDF, and PCBs 169, 114, 123, 
156, 167 and 189) while most of the remaining half-lives are in excess of 1.4  years. Several 
authors report the presence of these compounds 
in human blood in the general population (Costopoulou et al ., 2006 ; Scott et al ., 2008 ; 
Zubero et al., 2009 ) indicating a sustained, long-
term exposure that, when coupled with the anal -
yses for common pleiotropic response, argues in 
favour of the notion that all of the DLC-28s have 
the same carcinogenic potential in humans.
Experimental data on mechanism of carcino -
genesis induced by DLC-28 are available for 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF and PCB 126, in particular (Table  4.2 ), Both have been shown to bind to 
the AhR in humans and animals ( IARC, 1978 ; 
Safe, 2001 ), to translocate into the nucleus and 
activate numerous metabolic enzymes in vitro  
(human and non-human cell lines) and in vivo  
in experimental animals ( IARC, 1997 ; Safe, 
2001 ; Vezina et al ., 2004 ; Haws et al ., 2006 ), to trigger changes in growth factors and signal -
ling pathways related to cellular replication in 
rodents ( Hemming et al., 1995 ; Vondrácek et al., 
2005 ; N’Jai et al ., 2008 ). 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF poten -
tial effect on cell replication is suggested in the NTP study ( Walker et al ., 2007 ), and promo -
tion in skin, liver and lung tissues is reported in 
initiation-promotion studies ( Hébert et al., 1990 ; 
Anderson et al ., 1991 ; Waern et al ., 1991 ). PCB 
126 acts as a promoter of liver cancer in initia -
tion-promotion studies ( Hemming et al ., 1995 ; 
Haag-Grönlund et al ., 1998 ) with measured 
increases in cell-replication rate in the popula -
tions of initiated cells ( Vondrácek et al ., 2005 ). 
PCB 126 and 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF induce oxidative stress, the latter in a dose-dependent manner in brain and liver of rats ( Hassoun et al ., 2002 ; 
Hennig et al ., 2002 ). These two compounds are 
carcinogenic in mixtures with TCDD ( IARC, 
1978 ; Hassoun et al ., 2001 ; NTP, 2006d ) and by 
themselves in the NTP chronic bioassays in rats, where they increase hepatocellular adenomas, cholangiocarcinomas, gingival squamous-cell 
carcinomas, and, possibly, lung cystic kera -
tonizing epitheliomas ( NTP, 20 06b , c, d).
4.4 Synthesis
There is strong evidence to support a receptor-
mediated mechanism of action for TCDD-associated carcinogenesis in humans where the 
primary mechanism is the promotion of tumour development through the activation of cellular 
replication and the alteration in cellular senes -
cence and apoptosis. Dioxin, through activation 
of an array of metabolic enzymes also increases 
the risk for oxidative stress, which serves as an 
indirect initiator of carcinogenesis. These events make dioxin a complete carcinogen. The conser -
vation of the AhR and the related signalling pathways across species strongly support this mechanism in humans.
The receptor-mediated mechanism of action 
for TCDD-associated carcinogenesis in humans 
369IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
is strongly suggested as the mechanism of action 
that would result in 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF and PCB 
126 causing cancer in humans. The primary mechanism is the promotion of carcinogenesis 
through the activation of cellular replication and 
the alteration in cellular senescence and apop -
tosis through the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor 
(AhR). These congeners, through activation 
of an array of metabolic enzymes, increase the risk for oxidative stress as an indirect initiator 
of carcinogenesis, which makes these congeners 
complete carcinogens. The conservation of the AhR and the related signalling pathways across 
species strongly support this mechanism of 
action in humans.
There is compelling evidence that the mech -
anism of action for TCDD-associated carcino -
genesis in humans operates as the mechanism of action for carcinogenesis in humans for 1,2,3,7,8-PeCDD, 1,2,3,4,7,8-HxCDD, 1,2,3,6,7,8-

to the AhR in human cells and demonstrate 
changes in gene expression consistent with those seen for TCDD, 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF and PCB 126. 
Where examined, data have been collected for 
these compounds supporting some, but not all, aspects of the mechanisms outlined for TCDD, 
2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF and PCB 126 that relate to acti -
vation of cell replication, alterations in cellular 
senescence and apoptosis, and increases in 
oxidative stress.

mental animals for the carcinogenicity of 
2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo- para -dioxin.
There is sufficient evidence  in experi -
mental animals for the carcinogenicity of 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran.
There is sufficient evidence  in experi -
mental animals for the carcinogenicity of 
3,3
′,4,4′,5-pentachlorobiphenyl.
There is strong evidence to support a receptor-
mediated mechanism that operates in humans 
for carcinogenesis associated with 2,3,7,8-tetra -
chlorodibenzo- para -dioxin, where the primary 
mechanism is the promotion of tumour devel -
opment through modification of cell replication and apoptosis, with a secondary mechanism 
related to increases of oxidative stress causing 
DNA damage. The conservation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and the related signalling 
pathways and responses across species, including 
humans, add additional strength to the notion that this mechanism is active in humans.
2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo- para -dioxin is 
carcinogenic to humans (Group 1) .
2,3,4,7,8-Pentachlorodibenzofuran is carci -
nogenic to humans (Group 1) .
3,3
′,4,4′,5-Pentachlorobiphenyl is carcino -
genic to humans (Group 1) .
In making the second and third overall 
evaluations, the Working Group considered the following mechanistic arguments:
There is strong evidence to support 
a receptor-mediated mechanism for 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran- and 
3,3
′,4,4′,5-pentachlorobiphenyl-associated 
carcinogenesis in humans based upon evidence 
of carcinogenicity in experimental animals and upon extensive evidence showing activity 
identical to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo- para -
dioxin (TCDD) for every step of the mechanism 
described for TCDD-associated carcinogenesis 
in humans including receptor binding, gene expression, protein-activity changes, cellular 
replication, oxidative stress, promotion in initi -
ation-promotion studies and complete carcino -
genesis in laboratory animals.

Ethylene oxide is an important raw material 
used in the manufacture of chemical derivatives 
that are the basis for major consumer goods in 
virtually all industrialized countries. More than half of the ethylene oxide produced worldwide 
is used in the manufacture of mono-ethylene 
glycol. Conversion of ethylene oxide to ethylene glycols represents a major use for ethylene oxide 
in most regions: North America (65%), western 
Europe (44%), Japan (63%), China (68%), Other Asia (94%), and the Middle East (99%). Important 
derivatives of ethylene oxide include di-ethylene 
glycol, tri-ethylene glycol, poly(ethylene) glycols, ethylene glycol ethers, ethanol-amines, 
and ethoxylation products of fatty alcohols, 
fatty amines, alkyl phenols, cellulose and poly(propylene) glycol ( Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration, 2005 ; Devanney, 2010 ).
A very small proportion (0.05%) of the annual 
production of ethylene oxide is used directly in 
the gaseous form as a sterilizing agent, fumigant 
and insecticide, either alone or in non-explo -
sive mixtures with nitrogen, carbon dioxide or 
dichlorofluoromethane ( Dever et al ., 2004 ). It 
is used to sterilize drugs, hospital equipment, 
disposable and reusable medical items, packaging ETHYLENE OXIDE
Ethylene oxide was considered by previous IARC Working Groups in 1976, 1984, 1987 , 1994, 
and 2007 ( IARC, 1976 , 1985 , 1987 , 1994 , 2008 ). Since that time new data have become avail -
able, which have been incorporated in this Monograph , and taken into consideration in the 
present evaluation.IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
materials, foods, books, museum artefacts, scien -
tific equipment, clothing, furs, railcars, aircraft, 
beehives and other items ( Lacson, 2003 ).
1.3 Human exposure
1.3.1  Occupational exposure
Most of the data on occupational exposure 
are related to the production of ethylene oxide and its use in industrial and hospital steriliza -
tion. Data were not available on exposures that 
are incurred outside North America and Europe, 
where almost half of the global amount of 
ethylene oxide is produced ( IARC, 2008 ).
CAREX (CARcinogen EXposure) is an inter -
national information system on occupational exposure to known and suspected carcinogens, with data collected from 1990 to 1993 in the 
European Union (EU). The CAREX database 
provides selected exposure data and documented estimates of the number of exposed workers by 
country, carcinogen, and industry ( Kauppinen 
et al ., 2000 ). Table 1.1  presents the results for 
ethylene oxide for the top-10 industries in the EU ( CAREX, 1999 ). From the US National 
Occupational Exposure Survey (1981–1983), it 
was estimated that approximately 270 000 workers 
(including approximately 120 000 women) in the 
USA were potentially exposed to ethylene oxide (NIOSH, 1990 ).
More recent data on employment in the 
industrial sectors that use ethylene oxide have been published by the US Occupational Safety 
and Health Administration (2005) . Estimated 
employment figures were: 1100 ethylene oxide-
production workers, 4000 ethoxylators, who use 
ethylene oxide to make chemical derivatives, and 
40 000 workers using ethylene oxide as a sterilant or fumigant in hospitals. In addition, approxi -
mately 2700 workers were employed in commer -
cial sterilization by manufacturers of medical and pharmaceutical products and producers of 
food spices, as contract sterilizers, and in other sterilization and fumigation facilities ( IARC, 
2008 ).
(a) Production of ethylene oxide and its derivatives 
The IARC Monographs  Volumes 60 and 
97 provide detailed descriptions of studies on 
historical occupational exposures to ethylene oxide ( IARC, 1994 , 2008 ).
Table 1.2 (available at http://monographs.
iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100F/100F-23-Table1.2.pdf ) summarizes reported exposure 
levels in industries where ethylene oxide and its derivatives are manufactured. Exposures vary with job category: workers involved in loading 
and distribution of ethylene oxide have the 
highest exposure. Where comparisons over time are possible, exposures appear to have decreased, 
presumably as control measures have been 
improved, with the most recent time-weighted average (TWA) values in the range of 1 ppm or 
less. Exposure to a large variety of chemicals 
other than ethylene oxide may occur, depending on the types of industrial process and job. These 
other chemicals include unsaturated aliphatic

hydrocarbons (e.g. ethylene, propylene), other 
epoxides (e.g. propylene oxide), chlorohydrins 
(e.g. epichlorohydrin and ethylene chlorohydrin), 
chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (e.g. dichlo -
romethane, dichloroethane), glycols and ethers 
(e.g. ethylene glycol, glycol ethers, bis(2-chlo -
roethyl)ether), aldehydes (e.g. formaldehyde), 
amines (e.g. aniline), aromatic hydrocarbons 
(e.g. benzene, styrene), alkyl sulfates and other 
compounds ( Shore et al., 1993 ).
(b) Use of ethylene oxide for industrial sterilization
Industrial workers may be exposed to 
ethylene oxide during sterilization of a variety of 
items such as medical equipment and products 
(e.g. surgical instruments, single-use medical devices), disposable health-care products, 
pharmaceutical and veterinary products, food 
spices and animal feed (see Table 1.3, available at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/
vol100F/100F-23-Table1.3.pdf ). Short-term 
exposures may be high for some workers. Despite recent reductions in exposure, in some countries 
and for some job categories high exposures to 
ethylene oxide may still occur.
Workers involved in the sterilization of 
medical products may also be exposed to gases that are present with ethylene oxide in the steri -
lizing mixture, such as chlorofluorocarbons and 
carbon dioxide ( Heiden Associates, 1988 ), and – 
in the past – to methyl formate, as reported in a 
study from Sweden ( Hagmar et al., 1991 ).
(c) Use of ethylene oxide in hospitals
Ethylene oxide is widely used in hospitals 
as a gaseous sterilant for heat-sensitive medical 
items, surgical instruments and other objects 
and fluids that come in contact with biological tissues. Large sterilizers are found in central 
supply areas of most hospitals, and smaller 
sterilizers are found in clinics, operating rooms, tissue banks and research facilities ( Glaser, 1979 ).The IARC Monograph  Volume 97 ( IARC, 
2008 ) summarized levels of exposure to ethylene 
oxide in hospitals. The more recent studies from Japan and France suggest that the 8-hour TWA concentrations are often below 1 mg/m
3 in 
hospitals.
Exposure to ethylene oxide appears to result 
mainly from peak emissions during operations such as opening the door of the sterilizer and 
unloading and transferring sterilized material. 
Proper engineering controls and work practices result in full-shift exposure levels of less than 
0.1 ppm [0.18 mg/m
3] and short-term exposure 
concentration of less than 2 ppm [3.6 mg/m3] 
(Mortimer & Kercher, 1989 ). In a survey of 125 
hospitals in the USA, however, use of personal 
protective equipment was found to be limited to wearing gloves while transferring sterilized 
items, but respirators were not used ( Elliott et al., 
1988 ).
As in industrial sterilization facilities, steri -
lizer operators in hospitals may also be exposed 
to other gases present in the sterilizing mixture, e.g. chlorofluorocarbons – banned by the 
Montreal Protocol in 1989 – and carbon dioxide 
(Wolfs et al., 1983 ; Deschamps et al., 1989 ). Some 
operating-room personnel handling ethylene 
oxide may also be exposed to anaesthetic gases 
and X-rays ( Sarto et al ., 1984a ; Chessor et al ., 
2005 ), and some may have occasional exposure 
to low concentrations of formaldehyde ( Gardner 
et al., 1989 ).
1.3.2  Non-occupational exposure
Most ethylene oxide is released into the atmos -
phere ( WHO, 2003 ). Ethylene oxide degrades in 
the atmosphere by reaction with photochemi -
cally produced hydroxyl radicals. The half-life of ethylene oxide in the atmosphere, assuming 
ambient concentrations of 5 × 10
5 hydroxyl radi -
cals/cm3, was reported to be 211 days. Neither rain 
nor absorption into aqueous aerosols is capable 
381IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
of removing ethylene oxide from the atmosphere 
(National Library of Medicine, 2005 ).
Mainstream tobacco smoke contains 
7 mg/cigarette ethylene oxide ( IARC, 2004 ). 
With the possible exception of cigarette smoke, 
other non-occupational sources of exposure to 
ethylene oxide (e.g. residues in spices and other food products ( Jensen, 1988 ; Fowles et al ., 2001 ) 
and in skin-care products ( Kreuzer, 1992 ) are 
expected to be minor. Ethylene oxide is formed during the combustion of fossil fuel, but the 
amount is expected to be negligible ( WHO, 
2003 ). Hospital patients may be exposed during 
dialysis when the equipment has been sterilized with ethylene oxide ( IPCS-CEC, 2001 ).
2. Cancer in Humans
Epidemiological evidence of the risk for 
human cancer from ethylene oxide derives principally from the follow-up of 14 cohorts of 
exposed workers, either in chemical plants where ethylene oxide was produced or converted into 
derivatives, or in facilities where it was used as 
a sterilant. Many of the workers employed at chemical factories were also exposed to other 
chemicals. The IARC Monograph  Volume 97 
(IARC, 2008 ) concluded that there is limited 
evidence  in humans for the carcinogenicity of 
ethylene oxide.
The most informative epidemiological inves -
tigation of ethylene oxide and cancer risk was a study by NIOSH of more than 18 000 employees 
at 14 industrial facilities where ethylene oxide was used to sterilize medical supplies or food spices, 
or to test the sterilizing equipment (Steenland 
et al. , 1991; Stayner et al. , 1993). This investiga -
tion benefited from greater statistical power than 
did other studies, as a consequence of its large 
sample size. In addition, there was a lower poten -
tial for confounding by concomitant exposure 
to other chemicals, while detailed quantitative assessments were made of individual exposures 
to ethylene oxide. For these reasons, the Working 
Group gave greatest weight to the findings of 
this study when assessing the balance of epide -
miological evidence on ethylene oxide, although 
findings from other studies were also taken into 
account.
2.1 Lympho-haematopoietic 
malignancies
Steenland et al. (1991)  reported on the initial 
mortality results for the NIOSH ethylene-oxide 
cohort. There were 343 deaths from cancer (380.3 
expected; SMR, 0.90; 95%CI: 0.81–1.00). SMRs were not statistically significantly increased for 
lymphatic and haematopoietic cancers combined 
(SMR, 1.06; 95%CI: 0.75–1.47), for lymphosar -
coma-reticulosarcoma [ICD-9 200] (SMR, 1.52; 
95%CI: 0.65–3.00), Hodgkin lymphoma (SMR, 
1.14; 95%CI: 0.31–2.92), leukaemia (SMR, 0.97; 95%CI: 0.52–1.67), non-Hodgkin lymphoma 
[ICD-9 202] (SMR, 1.20; 95%CI: 0.57–2.37) or 
myeloma (SMR, 0.59; 95%CI: 0.12–1.73). No significant trend in mortality was observed 
in relation to duration of exposure, but the 
SMR for leukaemia (1.79, based on five deaths) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (1.92, based on 
five deaths) were higher after allowance for a 
latency of more than 20 years. Among the steri -
lizer operators, mortality ratios were 2.78 (two 
deaths observed) for leukaemia and 6.68 (two 
deaths) for lymphosarcoma/reticulosarcoma. In a further analysis of the same study ( Stayner 
et al ., 1993 ), an exposure–response analysis was 
conducted with the use of previously derived quantitative estimates of individual exposure to 
ethylene oxide ( Greife et al ., 1988 ). Analysis was 
limited to 13 of the facilities studied, since expo -
sure information at one facility was inadequate. Mortality from lymphatic and haematopoietic 
cancer was greatest in the group with the highest category of cumulative exposure to ethylene 
382Ethylene oxide
oxide (> 8500 ppm–days) (13 deaths; SMR, 1.24; 
95%CI: 0.66–2.13), but the trend across three 
categories of cumulative exposure was weak ( χ2, 
0.97; P = 0.32). A similar pattern was observed for 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but not for leukaemia. 
In addition, a Cox proportional-hazard model was used to examine risk in relation to cumu -
lative exposure (ppm–days), average exposure (ppm), maximal exposure (ppm) and duration of exposure (days) to ethylene oxide. A significant 
positive trend in risk with increasing cumula -
tive exposure to ethylene oxide was observed 
for all neoplasms of the lymphatic and haemat -
opoietic tissues [ P < 0.05, two-tailed]. Moreover, 
this trend was strengthened [ P < 0.01] when the 
analysis was restricted to neoplasms of lymphoid-
cell origin (lymphocytic leukaemia, ICD-9 204; 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma, ICD-9 200, 202). The exposure–response relationship between cumu -
lative exposure to ethylene oxide and leukaemia was positive but non-significant [ P = 0.23]. The 
regression coefficients for neoplasms of the 
lymphatic and haematopoietic tissues for dura -
tion of exposure, average exposure, and maximal 
exposure were either weakly positive or negative.
Extending the mortality assessments 
through 1998, an updated life-table analysis of cancer mortality in the cohort was carried out 
(Steenland et al ., 2004 ) (see Table 2.1, available 
at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/
vol100F/100F-23-Table2.1.pdf ). There were 860 
deaths from cancer overall (SMR, 0.98; 95%CI: 
0.92–1.03), and a statistically significant excess was found only for cancer of the bone (SMR, 
2.82; 95%CI: 1.23–5.56, based on six observed 
deaths). In an internal analysis (excluding one small plant for which exposure data were 
not available), mortality from lymphatic and 
haematopoietic cancer was associated with log-cumulative exposures to ethylene oxide lagged 
by 15 years in men ( p for trend = 0.02), but not 
in women. However, duration of exposure, peak 
exposure, and average or cumulative exposure 
did not predict mortality from lymphatic and haematopoietic cancer. A similar pattern was 
observed for lymphoid-cell tumours specifically 
(including non-Hodgkin lymphoma, myeloma 
and lymphocytic leukaemia), with risks of 3.76 (95%CI: 1.03–13.64; p  for trend  =  0.13). [The 
Working Group noted that the exposure assess -
ment in the Steenland et al . (2004)  update was 
limited by the assumption that exposure levels 
did not change during extended follow-up for 
about 25% of workers who were exposed at the time of the last actual exposure-data collection. 
Follow-up taking place long after the period of 
highest exposure may have attenuated results in the most recent publication.]
A cohort of ethylene oxide-production 
workers in the Kanawha Valley Union Carbide facility (UC) in West Virginia (USA) was studied 
by Greenberg et al. (1990) , Teta et al. (1993) , and 
most recently by Swaen et al . (2009) . The latter 
report updated the cohort to include 2063 men employed between 1940 and 1988, and updated 
mortality information through 2003. No indica -
tions were found for excess cancer risks from 
exposure to ethylene oxide, including risks for 
lympho-haematopoietic malignancies, by SMR analysis. Combining primary data from the 
NIOSH and UC cohorts Valdez-Flores et al . 
(2010)  also reported no excess cancer risks by 
SMR-based analysis for these cohorts followed respectively to 1998 ( Steenland et al ., 2004 ) and 
2003 ( Swaen et al ., 2009 ). Other cohort studies 
did not consistently point at an increased risk for specific haematolymphoproliferative malignan -
cies, although moderate elevations of risk were 
reported in some investigations (see Table  2.1 
online).
A meta-analysis on the data available on 
nearly 33  000 workers from Germany, Italy, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the USA was 
performed by Teta et al. (1999) . The meta-SMR for 
all leukaemia was 1.08 (95%CI: 0.61–1.93, based 
on 35 deaths); for non-Hodgkin lymphoma it was 
1.34 (95%CI: 0.96–1.89, based on 33 deaths).
383IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
[The Working Group noted that evaluation of 
the possible risks for lymphatic and haematopoi -
etic cancer was hampered by inconsistencies in 
the histopathological classification of diagnoses over time. The interpretation of results for these 
malignancies was constrained by the diagnostic 
groupings that had been used by researchers when the studies were conducted.]
2.2 Cancer of the breast
Studies from four cohorts of workers exposed 
to ethylene oxide provided useful information on 
the association between this exposure and breast 
cancer ( Gardner et al., 1989 ; Hagmar et al., 1991 , 
1995 ; Norman et al., 1995 ; Steenland et al., 2003, 
2004 ; Coggon et al., 2004 ; see Table 2.2, available 
at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/
vol100F/100F-23-Table2.2.pdf ). The NIOSH 
study ( Steenland et al., 2004 ) and a cohort study 
of hospital-based sterilization workers in the United Kingdom ( Gardner et al ., 1989 ; Coggon 
et al ., 2004 ) examined mortality from breast 
cancer and found no overall excess risk. Three studies examined the incidence of breast cancer: 
the NIOSH study ( Steenland et al ., 2003 ) and a 
cohort study from Sweden ( Hagmar et al ., 1991 , 
1995 ) found no overall excess risk, while another 
cohort study from New York State, USA, found 
an excess risk of about 60%, which was border -
line significant ( Norman et al ., 1995 ). Internal 
analyses with inclusion of questionnaire data were carried out in the NIOSH study ( Steenland 
et al ., 2003 ) showing increased relative risks for 
breast cancer at the highest level of cumulative exposure to ethylene oxide (> 11620 ppm–days, 15-year lag, OR = 1.87, 95%CI: 1.12–3.10), with a 
significant exposure–response relationship [ P for 
trend  =  0.002), after controlling for parity and 
history of breast cancer in a first-degree relative.2.3 Other cancers
Several cohort studies provided data on 
 exposure to ethylene oxide and mortality 
from other cancers (stomach, brain, pancreas; 
see Table  2.2, available at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100F/100F-23-
Table2.2.pdf ). There was no consistent evidence 
of an association of these cancers with exposure 
to ethylene oxide.
2.4 Synthesis
The Working Group found some 
 epidemiological evidence for associations 
between exposure to ethylene oxide and 
lymphatic and haematopoietic cancers, and specifically lymphoid tumours (i.e. non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma, multiple myeloma and chronic 
lymphocytic leukaemia).
3. Cancer in Experimental Animals
Carcinogenicity studies with mice and rats 
exposed to ethylene oxide by inhalation, oral 
gavage, and subcutaneous injection were previ -
ously reviewed ( IARC, 1994 , 2008 ). Results of 
adequately conducted carcinogenicity studies are summarized in Table  3.1 . There have been 
no additional carcinogenicity studies in animals 
reported since the previous evaluation in IARC 
Monograph  Volume 97 ( IARC, 2008 ).
3.1 Inhalation exposure
In two inhalation studies in mice, there was 
an increased incidence of alveolar bronchiolar carcinomas and combined adenomas and carci -
nomas in male and female B6C3F
1 mice ( NTP, 
1987 ) and of lung adenomas in strain A/J female 
mice ( Adkins et al ., 1986 ). Treatment-related

cystadenoma, mammary gland carcinomas 
and uterine adenocarcinomas were also seen in 
B6C3F1 mice ( NTP, 1987 ; Picut et al., 2003 ).
In two inhalation studies in F344 rats ( Lynch 
et al., 1984 ; Snellings et al., 1984 ; Garman, et al., 
1985 , 1986 ), there was an increased incidence 
in gliomas [not further specified], mononuclear cell leukaemia and peritoneal mesotheliomas. 
A treatment-related increase in subcutaneous fibromas also occurred in male rats ( Snellings 
et al., 1984 ).
3.2 Other routes of exposure
In one study, subcutaneous injection of 
ethylene oxide in female NMRI mice resulted 
in a dose-related increase in the incidence of 
sarcomas at the injection site ( Dunkelberg, 1981 ).
In one study with female Sprague-Dawley 
rats that received ethylene oxide by gavage, there was a treatment-related increase in fore-stomach squamous-cell carcinomas ( Dunkelberg, 1982 ).
4. Other Relevant Data
Experimental studies on ethylene oxide have 
been evaluated previously in IARC Monograph  
Volumes 60 and 97 ( IARC, 1994 , 2008 ). There is 
an extensive body of data on the mechanism of ethylene oxide-induced carcinogenicity encom -
passing toxicokinetics, DNA-adduct forma -
tion, biomarkers, genotoxicity, and molecular biology. Ethylene oxide is a direct alkylating 
agent that reacts with nucleophiles without 
the need for metabolic transformation. It has been shown to have genotoxic and mutagenic 
activity in numerous assays in both somatic 
and germ cells, and prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms ( IARC, 1994 , 2008 ). Ethylene oxide 
is active in a wide range of in vitro  and in vivo  
systems. Increases in both gene mutations and chromosomal alterations, two general classes of cancer-related genetic changes, have been observed. The direct reaction of ethylene oxide 
with DNA is thought to initiate the cascade of 
genetic and related events that lead to cancer (Swenberg et al ., 1990 ). Thus, formation of DNA 
adducts and resultant mutations are key steps in the mechanism of carcinogenicity for this agent.
4.1 Absorption, distribution, 
metabolism, and excretion
Ethylene oxide is readily taken up by the 
lungs and is absorbed relatively efficiently 
into the blood. A study of workers exposed to 
ethylene oxide revealed an alveolar retention of 75–80%, calculated from hourly measurements 
of ethylene oxide in ambient air, which ranged 
from 0.2 to 24.1 mg/m
3 [0.11–13.2 ppm], and in 
alveolar air, which ranged from 0.05 to 6 mg/m3 
[0.03–3.3 ppm] ( Brugnone et al ., 1985 , 1986 ). 
At steady-state, therefore, 20–25% of inhaled ethylene oxide that reached the alveolar space was exhaled as the unchanged compound and 
75–80% was taken up by the body and metabo -
lized. Blood samples taken from workers at four 
hours after the work-shift gave venous blood/
alveolar air coefficients of 12–17 and venous 
blood/environmental air coefficients of 2.5–3.3.
The mammalian metabolic pathways of 
ethylene oxide are shown in Fig.  4.1 and can be summarized as follows: Ethylene oxide is converted ( a) by enzymatic and non-enzymatic 
hydrolysis to ethylene glycol, which is partly excreted as such and partly metabolized further via glycolaldehyde, glycolic acid and glyoxalic 
acid to oxalic acid, formic acid and carbon 
dioxide; and ( b) by conjugation with glutathione 
(GSH) followed by further metabolism to S-(2-
hydroxyethyl)cysteine, S-(2-carboxymethyl)
cysteine and N -acetylated derivatives ( N-acetyl-
S-(2-hydroxyethyl)cysteine (also known as S -(2-
hydroxyethyl)mercapturic acid or HEMA) and N-acetyl- S-(2-carboxymethyl)cysteine) ( Wolfs 
388Ethylene oxide
et al ., 1983 ; Popp et al ., 1994 ), which are partly 
converted to thio-diacetic acid ( Scheick et al ., 
1997 ).
Concentrations of ethylene glycol were deter -
mined at the end of day 3 of a normal working week 
in blood samples from sterilization personnel 
exposed to ethylene oxide. TWA concentrations of ethylene oxide determined over eight hours 
ranged from 0.3 to 52 ppm [0.55–95.2 mg/m
3] 
(overall mean, 4.2 ppm [7.7 mg/m3]). The mean 
concentrations of ethylene glycol in the blood of exposed subjects were twice as high (90 mg/L) as 
those in controls (45 mg/L) ( Wolfs et al., 1983 ).
The concentration of thioethers excreted in 
urine collected at the end of sterilization proc -
esses was found to be twice as high in non-smoking personnel (10.2 mmol/mol creatinine) 
exposed to peak concentrations of 1–200 ppm 
[1.83–366 mg/m
3] ethylene oxide as the thioether 
concentration in unexposed workers (5.46 mmol/
mol creatinine). The concentration of ethylene 
oxide in air was not monitored routinely ( Burgaz 
et al., 1992 ).
The glutathione- S-transferase (GST) activity 
towards ethylene oxide in cytosolic fractions from human livers was low (too low to determine 
the Michaelis-Menten constant [Km] value). The 
maximum velocity (V
max) varied from 7.6 to 10.6 
nmol/min/mg protein. Epoxide-hydrolase (EH) 
activity in the microsomal fraction of human liver 
averaged 1.8 nmol/min/mg protein. The Km for hydrolysis was estimated to be approximately 0.2 
mM, but non-enzymatic hydrolysis was consid -
erable and precluded accurate  measurement 
(Fennell & Brown, 2001 ).
Metabolism of ethylene oxide to the GSH 
conjugate and ethylene glycol is generally consid -
ered to be the major pathway for the elimination of DNA-reactive ethylene oxide. However, strongly 
suggestive evidence in vitro  was presented by 
Hengstler et al . (1994)  that glycolaldehyde is 
formed by further metabolism of ethylene glycol and that this derivative leads to DNA–protein crosslinks and DNA strand-breaks (as measured with the alkaline elution assay) after in-vitro incubation with human mononuclear peripheral 
blood cells.
4.2 Genetic and related effects
4.2.1  GST polymorphisms
Ethylene oxide is a substrate of the GST 
iso-enzyme T1 ( Hayes et al ., 2005 ). This detoxi -
fying enzyme is polymorphic and a relatively 
large proportion of the population (about 20% of Caucasians, almost 50% of Asians) has a 
homozygous deletion ( GSTT1 -null genotype) 
(Bolt & Thier, 2006 ). As expected, these indi -
viduals show a significantly higher amount of hydroxyethyl valine in their haemoglobin due 
to the presence of endogenous ethylene oxide (Thier et al., 2001 ). Nevertheless, the influence of 
this genetic trait on the formation of this type of adduct as a result of exposure to exogenous ethylene oxide at the workplace is much less 
clear, as discussed below.
In the cytoplasm of erythrocytes obtained 
from 36 individuals, ethylene oxide was elimi -
nated three to six times faster in samples from 
so-called conjugators (defined by a standardized conjugation reaction of methyl bromide and 
GSH; 75% of the population) than in those from 
the remaining 25% (who lack this GST-specific activity). In the latter samples, the rate of disap -
pearance did not differ from that of controls. In this experiment, the disappearance of ethylene oxide was investigated in the gas phase, in closed 
vials that contained GSH and cytoplasm of 
erythrocytes ( Hallier et al., 1993 ).
Studies on the genotoxicity of ethylene oxide 
were reviewed in detail in IARC Monograph  
Volume 97 ( IARC, 2008 ). Studies with periph -
eral blood of exposed workers have shown that 
exposure to ethylene oxide is associated with an 
elevated number of chromosomal aberrations including breaks, gaps, exchanges, and supernu -
merary chromosomes. An increased frequency

oxide was also reported.
4.2.2  DNA-adduct formation
In-vitro and in-vivo studies have shown 
that ethylene oxide can bind to cellular macro -
molecules, which results in a variety of DNA, 
RNA and protein adducts. The major DNA adduct recovered in vivo  is N 7-(2-hydroxyethyl)
guanine (7-HEG), while some minor adducts such as N 3-(2-hydroxyethyl)adenine (3-HEA) 
and O
6-(2-hydroxyethyl)guanine ( O6-HEG), 
are detected at much lower levels ( Walker et al ., 
1992 ). In-vitro studies indicate that other minor 
adducts can also be formed from the reaction of ethylene oxide with the N 1 and N
6 positions of 
adenine and the N 3 position of cytosine, uracil 
and thymine ( IARC, 1994 ; Tates et al ., 1999 ; 
Kolman et al., 2002 ).
Tompkins et al . (2009)  suggested that the 
mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of ethylene oxide could be attributed to formation of multiple 2-hydroxyethyl (HE) DNA adducts such as 
3-HEA and O
6-HEG. Boysen et al. (2009)  argued 
that there is little evidence that 7-HEG adducts cause mutations since – unlike the N 1, N
2, or O6 
positions of guanine – they do not participate in hydrogen bonding in the DNA double-helix and 
easily de-purinate. These authors conclude that the formation of N7-guanine adducts cannot 
be used in isolation as a quantitative biomarker for pro-mutagenic DNA lesions or mutagenic response. Marsden et al . (2009)  used a dual-
isotope approach to distinguish between endog -
enously formed background levels of 7-HEG and exogenously formed 7-HEG adducts in rats 
following exposure to [
14C]-labelled ethylene 
oxide. By combining liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and high-perfor -
mance liquid chromatography/accelerator mass 
spectrometry analysis, both the endogenous and 
exogenous N7-HEG adducts were quantified in tissues of [14C]ethylene oxide-treated rats. Levels 
of [14C]-7-HEG induced in spleen, liver, and 
stomach DNA were insignificant compared with the measured background levels of N7-HEG 
naturally present.
The exact mechanism by which the other 
ethylene oxide-induced DNA adducts such 
as 3-HEA and O
6-HEG may lead to mutation 
is unknown. Several mechanisms could be 
involved, including the mispairing of altered 
bases or the formation of apurinic/apyrimidinic sites via DNA repair or chemical depurination/ 
depyrimidination combined with the insertion 
of another base, which would typically be an adenine opposite an apurinic site ( Tates et al ., 
1999 ; Houle et al ., 2006 ). These lesions can also 
lead to the formation of DNA single-strand breaks and, subsequently, to chromosomal breakage. In 
addition, the putative ethylene oxide metabolite, 
glycolaldehyde, has been shown to form DNA–protein crosslinks and DNA single-strand breaks 
(Hengstler et al., 1994 ).
4.2.3  Cytogenetic alterations and mutations
Studies of human exposure to ethylene oxide 
have focused on individuals employed in the operation of hospital- or factory-based steriliza -
tion units, and on workers who were involved in 
manufacturing or processing of ethylene oxide. 
The studies show that exposure to ethylene oxide 
results in chromosomal alterations that are related to both the level and duration of expo -
sure, while a single study suggested that expo -
sure to ethylene oxide causes gene mutations.
(a) Sister chromatid exchange
The induction of increased frequencies of 
sister chromatid exchange (SCE) has been found 
to be a sensitive indicator of genotoxic exposure 
to ethylene oxide in humans ( Tates et al ., 1991 ). 
In several studies, significant differences were 
found in SCE frequencies in individuals and/or 
groups exposed to levels of ethylene oxide higher 
391IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
than the designated low-exposure group from 
the same or a similar environments ( Yager et al., 
1983 ; Sarto et al., 1984a ; Stolley et al., 1984 ; Tates 
et al ., 1991 ; Schulte et al ., 1992 ). These findings 
support the observation that SCE frequencies 
varied with level and frequency of exposure to 
ethylene oxide. In two studies SCE frequen -
cies were investigated over time: they remained 
elevated for at least six months even when expo -
sures diminished or ceased after the first assess -
ment ( Sarto et al., 1984b ; Stolley et al., 1984 ).
(b) Chromosomal aberrations
Chromosomal aberration frequencies corre -
late with exposure concentrations of ethylene oxide and/or duration of the exposure ( Clare et al., 
1985 ; Galloway et al., 1986 ; Tates et al., 1991 ; Lerda 
& Rizzi, 1992 ). As reported for SCE, the validity 
of these comparisons is supported by the obser -
vation that some investigators found significant 
increases in chromosomal aberrations in high-
dose groups but not in low-dose groups exposed 
in the same or similar environments ( Sarto et al., 
1984b ; Galloway et al., 1986 ). In workers exposed 
to a range of concentrations of ethylene oxide [0.01–200 ppm; 0.02–366 mg/m
3] the presence of 
chromosomal aberrations was evaluated; in most 
of the workers significant increases in chromo -
somal aberrations were found ( Pero et al ., 1981 ; 
Högstedt et al ., 1983 , 1990 ; Sarto et al ., 1984b ; 
Richmond et al ., 1985 ; Galloway et al ., 1986 ; 
Karelová et al ., 1987 ; Tates et al ., 1991 ; Lerda 
& Rizzi, 1992 ; Ribeiro et al ., 1994 ; Major et al ., 
1996 ). In one study, such increases were found in 
individuals exposed to concentrations of ethylene 
oxide of approximately 1 ppm [1.83 mg/m3] and 
even lower ( Högstedt et al ., 1983 ). However, in 
other studies of workers exposed to these low concentrations of ethylene oxide, evidence of increased chromosomal aberrations was not 
found ( Van Sittert et al ., 1985 ; Mayer et al., 1991 ).(c) Micronuclei
Few investigators have evaluated the impact 
of exposure to ethylene oxide on the frequency 
of micronucleated cells, and the available studies 
reported positive or no effects. Högstedt et al . 
(1990)  and Ribeiro et al. (1994)  found an increased 
frequency of micronucleated lymphocytes in workers, while Tates et al . (1991)  found signifi -
cant increases in micronucleus frequency in 
workers exposed to high, but not to low doses. 
Exposure concentrations in all these studies 
varied widely, ranging from < 1 ppm to 400 ppm [1.83–732 mg/m
3] ethylene oxide. Studies that 
evaluated micronucleus formation in individuals 
exposed to ethylene oxide at concentrations ≤ 1 
ppm were negative ( Högstedt et al ., 1983 ; Sarto 
et al., 1990 , 1991 ; Tates et al., 1995 ).
In two studies micronucleus formation was 
determined in cells other than lymphocytes. Ribeiro et al . (1994)  evaluated both periph -
eral blood lymphocytes and exfoliated buccal cells in individuals exposed to 2–5 ppm [3.66–9.15 mg/m
3] ethylene oxide (TWA); micronucleus 
frequencies in buccal cells were not associated 
with the exposure, while those in lymphocytes 
showed a significant positive association. Sarto et 
al. (1990)  found a significant increase in micro -
nucleus frequency in nasal mucosal cells, but not in exfoliated buccal cells of workers exposed to ethylene oxide at concentrations below 0.38 ppm 
[0.7 mg/m
3] (T WA).
(d) Gene mutations
The question whether occupational exposure 
to ethylene oxide is associated with the induction 
of gene mutations has been addressed in three 
reports. In the first study, the T-cell cloning assay 
was used to measure HPRT  mutant frequencies in 
peripheral blood lymphocytes from nine ethylene 
oxide-exposed hospital workers and 15 ethylene 
oxide-exposed factory workers ( Tates et al., 1991 ). 
Hospital workers included nurses and techni -
cians involved in the sterilization of medical 
392Ethylene oxide
equipment and exposed to ethylene oxide once or 
twice a week for about 10 minutes. The concen -
trations of ethylene oxide ranged from 20 to 25 ppm [36.6–45.8 mg/m
3] in the sterilization room 
and from 22 to 72 ppm [40.3–131.8 mg/m3] in 
front of the sterilizer immediately after opening. 
The hospital workers were matched for age, sex 
and smoking habits with a control group of eight unexposed administrative workers. The 
factory workers were employed at a plant that 
was involved in the production of ethylene oxide-sterilized disposable medical equipment, 
and were similarly matched with a group of 15 
unexposed controls in the same factory. During a four-month monitoring period (equivalent to the 
lifespan of erythrocytes in humans), five workers 
were engaged in ‘daily’ sterilization activities, two workers were involved in ‘daily’ steriliza -
tion except for leave periods of 7 or 11 days, and the eight remaining workers were ‘occasion -
ally’ exposed to ethylene oxide during exposure 
control, packing and quality control of sterilized 
products. Before the collection of samples in early 1990, the mean duration of exposure of 
factory workers to ethylene oxide had been 12 
years (range, 3–27 years), with average ambient exposure levels from 1989 onwards that were 
estimated at about 17 ppm [~31 mg/m
3]. Based 
on measurements of N-(2-hydroxyethy)valine–
haemoglobin adducts, which integrate expo -
sure over time, average exposures to ethylene 
oxide in the four months before blood sampling 
were estimated at a 40-hour TWA of 0.025 ppm 
[0.046 mg/m3] for hospital workers and 5 ppm 
[9.15 mg/m3] for factory workers ( Tates et al ., 
1991 ). The average HPRT  mutant frequencies in 
hospital workers (12.4 ± 9.9 × 10−6) and factory 
workers (13.8  ±  4.4  ×  10−6) were remarkably 
similar and showed increases of 55% and 60%, 
respectively, above the background frequency in 
their respective control groups (8.0 ± 3.6 × 10−6 
and 8.6  ±  4.4  ×  10−6); however, the mutagenic 
response was significantly elevated only in the 
factory workers, which was probably due to the higher exposure concentrations and tissue doses 
of ethylene oxide in these workers.
In a follow-up study of workers in an ethylene 
oxide-production plant, Tates et al . (1995)  used 
the T-cell cloning assay to measure HPRT  mutant 
frequencies in three exposed groups and one unexposed group (seven subjects per group). Group-I workers were incidentally exposed to 
acute high concentrations of ethylene oxide, while 
workers in Groups II and III had been chroni -
cally exposed to low concentrations of ethylene 
oxide for < 5 years and > 15 years, respectively. 
No significant differences in mutant frequen -
cies were observed between any combination 
of worker or control groups, which implies that 
incidental exposure to high levels of ethylene oxide (28−429 ppm; 52–785 mg/m
3) or chronic 
exposure to low concentrations of ethylene oxide 
(< 0.005−0.02 ppm; < 0.01–0.04 mg/m3) did not 
cause any measurable permanent gene mutation in lymphocytes at this locus.
In-vivo mutation-induction studies with 
reporter genes such as Hprt  or the LacI -transgene 
have shown that ethylene oxide can significantly 
increase the frequency of mutations in both mice and rats ( Walker & Skopek, 1993 ; Sisk 
et al ., 1997 ; Walker et al ., 1997a , b; Tates et al ., 
1999 ; Recio et al ., 2004 ). The type of mutation 
that is recovered appears to be influenced by 
the assay system used. In mouse splenic and/or 
thymic T lymphocytes, mutations in Hprt  could 
be detected after shorter exposures (a 4-week 
inhalation exposure or multiple intra-peritoneal 
injections over the course of one week) and appeared to consist of larger deletion mutations 
as well as base-pair substitutions and frame-shift 
mutations ( Walker & Skopek, 1993 ; Walker et al., 
1997a , b). The latter point mutations appeared 
to originate primarily from either altered G or A nucleobases ( Walker & Skopek, 1993 ; IARC, 
1994 ). In the inhalation study, no significant 
increases in LacI  mutations were seen in the 
spleen, bone marrow or germ cells of mice after four weeks of exposure to ethylene oxide ( Sisk 
393IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
et al ., 1997 ). A modest but significant increase 
in LacI  mutants was seen in the lungs of mice 
exposed to 200 ppm [366 mg/m3] ethylene oxide. 
In a follow-up study with prolonged exposure (up 
to 48 weeks), significant increases in LacI  mutants 
were seen in the bone marrow and testes of the 
ethylene oxide-exposed transgenic mice ( Recio 
et al ., 2004 ). DNA-sequence analysis of mutants 
obtained from the bone marrow showed that only AT→TA transversions were recovered at a 
significantly increased frequency in the exposed 
mice. A unique mutational spectrum was not seen in the testes.
An elevated frequency of mutations or a 
change in mutational spectra has been seen in the tumours of ethylene oxide-treated mice 
(Houle et al ., 2006 ; Hong et al ., 2007 ). In the 
study by Hong et al . (2007) , K-Ras mutations 
were detected in 100% (23/23) of ethylene oxide-induced lung tumours compared with 25% 
(27/108) of spontaneous tumours. Codon-12 G→T transversions occurred frequently in the 
ethylene oxide-induced lung neoplasms (21/23) 
but infrequently in spontaneous lung neoplasms (1/108). Similarly, K- Ras mutations were found 
in 86% (18/21) of Harderian gland tumours from ethylene oxide-treated animals, but were seen in only 7% (2/27) of the spontaneous tumours in this 
organ. Codon-13 G→C and codon-12 G→T trans -
versions were common in the ethylene oxide-
induced Harderian gland tumours, but they were 
absent in the spontaneous tumours in this organ 
(0/27). K- Ras mutations were also seen in 83% 
(5/6) of ethylene oxide-induced uterine tumours, 
all of which showed a G→C transition in codon 13. 
The incidence in spontaneous uterine tumours was not reported. A similar study by Houle et 
al. (2006)  provided evidence of the involvement 
of H- Ras and p53  mutations in mammary gland 
tumours induced by ethylene oxide in mice. The 
mutation frequency was only slightly elevated for 
H-Ras (33% in treated vs  26% in controls) or p53  
(67% in the ethylene oxide-treated versus 58% in 
the control animals), but the mutational spectra in tumours obtained from control and treated 
animals differed significantly. The mutational 
spectra were generally consistent with a targeting 
of G and A bases by ethylene oxide ( Houle et al., 
2006 ; Hong et al ., 2007 ). The high frequency of 
mutation in these genes, particularly mutations in the critical codons of K- Ras and inactivation 
of p53, indicate that mutations are induced in the 
tumours of ethylene oxide-treated mice and that the changes probably play an important role in ethylene oxide-induced tumour development in 
these tissues.
Acute myelogenous leukaemia in patients 
previously treated with alkylating agents frequently shows specific characteristics that 
allow it to be distinguished from acute myelog -
enous leukaemia induced by other agents (such 
as topoisomerase II-inhibitors) or occurring 
spontaneously ( Pedersen-Bjergaard & Rowley, 
1994 ; Pedersen-Bjergaard et al., 2006 ). One of the 
hallmarks of leukaemias induced by alkylating agents is that they frequently show loss of chro -
mosomes 5 or 7 (−5, −7) or loss of part of the 
long arms of these chromosomes (5q-, 7q-). In 
addition, mutations in p53  are frequently seen in 
leukaemias with the −5/5q- karyotype, and muta -
tions in p53  and Ras  are seen in a subset of those 
that exhibit the −7/7q- karyotype ( Christiansen 
et al ., 2001 ; Pedersen-Bjergaard et al ., 2006 ). 
Although ethylene oxide has not been investi -
gated specifically for its ability to induce losses of chromosomes 5 or 7, or deletions of the long 
arms of these chromosomes (5q- or 7q-), it has 
been reported to induce similar types of chro -
mosomal alteration and deletions in a variety of 
experimental models and/or in the lymphocytes 
of exposed workers ( IARC, 1994 ; Major et al ., 
1996 , 1999 ). The detection of elevated levels of 
chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of ethylene oxide-exposed workers is of particular interest, 
as individuals with increased levels of chromo -
somal aberrations or micronuclei in these cells 
are at an increased risk for cancer ( Hagmar et al., 
394Ethylene oxide
1998 ; Liou et al ., 1999 ; Smerhovsky et al ., 2001 ; 
Hagmar et al., 2004 ; Boffetta et al., 2007 ; Bonassi 
et al., 2007 ).
A comparison of the evidence for ethylene 
oxide-induced genetic and related changes in 
experimental animals and humans is summa -
rized in Table 4.1 .
In conclusion, the numerous studies on 
ethylene oxide that focused on toxicokinetics, 
DNA-adduct formation, biomarkers, genotox -
icity, and molecular biology provide strong 
evidence that the carcinogenicity of ethylene 
oxide, a direct-acting alkylating agent, involves a genotoxic mechanism of action. The direct reac -
tion of ethylene oxide with DNA is thought to initiate the cascade of genetic and related events that lead to cancer. Ethylene oxide induces 
a dose-related increase in the frequency of 
ethylene oxide-derived haemoglobin adducts in exposed humans and rodents, induces a dose-
related increase in the frequency of ethylene 
oxide-derived DNA adducts in exposed rodents, consistently acts as a mutagen and clastogen at all 
phylogenetic levels, induces heritable transloca -
tions in the germ cells of exposed rodents, and 
induces a dose-related increase in the frequency of sister chromatid exchange, chromosomal aberrations and micronucleus formation in the 
lymphocytes of exposed workers.
5. Evaluation
There is limited evidence  in humans for a causal 
association of ethylene oxide with lymphatic and haematopoietic cancers (specifically lymphoid 
tumours, i.e. non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia), 
and breast cancer.
There is sufficient evidence  in experimental 
animals for the carcinogenicity of ethylene oxide.
There is strong evidence that the carci -
nogenicity of ethylene oxide, a direct-acting 
alkylating agent, operates by a genotoxic mecha -
nism. A dose-related increase in the frequency of ethylene oxide-derived haemoglobin adducts has been observed in exposed humans and rodents, 
and a dose-related increase in the frequency of 
ethylene oxide-derived DNA adducts has been demonstrated in exposed rodents. Ethylene oxide 
consistently acts as a mutagen and clastogen 
at all phylogenetic levels, it induces heritable

in the lymphocytes of exposed workers.
Ethylene oxide is carcinogenic to humans 
(Group 1) .
In making the overall evaluation, the 
Working Group considered that there is sufficient evidence  for the carcinogenicity of ethylene oxide 
in experimental animals, and relied heavily on 
the compelling data in support of the genotoxic 
mechanism described above.

Formaldehyde is produced worldwide on a 
large scale by catalytic, vapour-phase oxidation 
of methanol. Formaldehyde is used mainly in the 
production of various types of resin. Phenolic, urea, and melamine resins have wide uses as 
adhesives and binders in the wood-production, 
pulp-and-paper, and the synthetic vitreous-fibre industries, in the production of plastics 
and coatings, and in textile finishing. Polyacetal 
resins are widely used in the production of plas -
tics. Formaldehyde is also used extensively as an 
intermediate in the manufacture of industrial 
chemicals, such as 1,4-butanediol, 4,4 ′-methyl -
enediphenyl diisocyanate, penta-erythritol, and 
hexamethylenetetramine. Formaldehyde is used 
directly in aqueous solution (known as formalin) as a disinfectant and preservative in many appli -
cations ( IARC, 2006 ).fORMALDEHYDE
Formaldehyde was considered by previous IARC Working Groups in 1981, 1987 , 1994, and 
2004 (IARC, 1982 , 1987 , 1995 , 2006 ). Since that time new data have become available, which 
have been incorporated in this Monograph , and taken into consideration in the present 
evaluation.IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
1.3 Occurrence and exposure
1.3.1  Environmental occurrence and 
exposure
Formaldehyde is found as a natural product 
in most living systems and in the environment. 
It occurs naturally in fruits and some foods, 
and it is formed endogenously in mammals, including humans, as a consequence of oxida -
tive metabolism. In addition to these natural sources, common non-occupational sources of exposure to formaldehyde include combus -
tion processes, e.g. through emissions from motor vehicles, power plants, incinerators, refineries, wood stoves, and kerosene heaters. 
Formaldehyde may be released from particle 
boards and similar building materials, carpets, paints and varnishes, during cooking of some 
foods, and during its use as a disinfectant. It is 
also present in tobacco smoke. An indirect source of exposure to formaldehyde is its formation via 
photochemical oxidation of hydrocarbons, such 
as methane, and other precursors emitted from combustion processes ( NTP, 20 05 ; IARC, 2006 ). 
Formaldehyde has a short half-life in the envi -
ronment, because it is removed from the air by photochemical  processes and by precipitation 
and biodegradation ( NTP, 20 05 ).
Concentrations of formaldehyde in outdoor 
air are generally below 0.001 mg/m
3 in remote 
areas and below 0.02 mg/m3 in urban settings. 
The levels of formaldehyde in indoor air of 
houses are typically 0.02–0.06 mg/m3; indoor 
combustion sources can significantly increase these levels. Cigarettes may contribute as much 
as 10–25% of the indoor exposure. Average concentrations of 0.5 mg/m
3 or more have been 
measured in ‘mobile homes’, but these have 
declined since the late 1980s as a result of stand -
ards that require that building materials – e.g. 
particle boards – emit lower concentrations of 
formaldehyde. A recent study of emissions from 
mosquito coils found the average concentration of formaldehyde exceeded 100 μg/m3 (IARC, 2006 , 
2010 ; Lee & Wang, 2006 ). Data on formaldehyde 
concentrations in outdoor air in residential and public settings, and information on exposure to formaldehyde associated with household use of 
solid fuels and high-temperature frying, have 
been reviewed in IARC Monograph  Volumes 88 
and 95 ( IARC, 2006 , 2010 ).
Automobile exhaust is a major source of 
formaldehyde in ambient air. Recent reports suggest that formaldehyde emissions may be 
higher from vehicles powered by compressed 
natural gas compared with those running on ethanol or gasohol ( Corrêa & Arbilla, 2005 ), and 
that these emissions may be decreased by substi -
tution of an ethanol-biodiesel-diesel blend for diesel fuel ( Shi et al ., 2006 ). In addition, formal -
dehyde can be absorbed through the skin from cosmetics or via contact with other consumer products containing formaldehyde, such as 
unwashed permanent-press fabrics treated with 
formaldehyde-releasing resins ( NTP, 20 05 ).
1.3.2  Occupational exposure
Occupational exposure to formaldehyde 
occurs in a wide variety of occupations and 
industries. CAREX (CARcinogen EXposure) 
is an international information system on  occupational exposure to known and suspected 
 carcinogens based on data collected in the 
European Union (EU) from 1990 to 1993. The CAREX database provides selected exposure 
data and documented estimates of the number 
of exposed workers by country, carcinogen, and industry ( Kauppinen et al ., 2000 ). Table  1.1  
presents the results for formaldehyde in the EU by industry ( CAREX, 1999 ).
In IARC Monograph  Volume 88 ( IARC, 2006 ) 
data were reviewed on occupational exposure to formaldehyde by type of industry. The highest continuous exposures (2–5 ppm; 2.5–6.1 mg/m
3) 
were measured in the past during varnishing of 
furniture and wooden floors, in the finishing of

textiles, in the garment industry, in the treatment 
of fur, and in certain jobs within manufactured 
board mills and foundries. Short-term exposures 
to high levels (3 ppm and higher; ≥ 3.7 mg/m3) 
have been reported for embalmers, pathologists, 
and paper workers. Lower concentrations have 
usually been encountered during the manufac -
ture of man-made vitreous fibres, abrasives and 
rubber, and in formaldehyde-production indus -
tries. A very wide range of exposure levels has 
been observed in the production of resins and 
plastic products. The development of resins that 
release less formaldehyde, and improved venti -
lation have resulted in lower exposure levels 
in many industrial settings in recent decades 
(IARC, 2006 ).
2. Cancer in Humans
2.1 Cancer of the nasopharynx
In IARC Monograph  Volume 88 ( IARC, 2006 ) 
it was concluded that there was sufficient evidence  
for the carcinogenicity of formaldehyde, based primarily on its association with nasopharyn -
geal cancer. There have been relatively few new 
studies published on this association since that 
time, although there have been several re-evalu -
ations and meta-analyses.
2.1.1  Cohort studies
In the most recent follow-up of the largest 
cohort study from the USA of industrial workers 
exposed to formaldehyde, a statistically signifi -
cant excess of deaths from nasopharyngeal 
cancer was observed in comparison with the US 
national population, with statistically significant 
exposure–response relationships for peak expo -
sure and cumulative exposure ( Hauptmann et al., 
2004 ; see Table  2.1 available at http://monographs.
iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100F/100F-24-Table2.1.pdf ). Based on eight cases, a significant excess mortality from nasopharyngeal cancer was observed among formaldehyde-exposed 
workers (SMR, 2.10; 95%CI: 1.05–4.21). A highly 
statistically significant ( P
trend < 0.001) exposure–
response relationship was observed between 
peak-exposure to formaldehyde and risk for 
nasopharyngeal cancer in a Poisson regression-analysis. All exposed cases were in the highest 
category of peak-exposure, and the relative risk 
was 1.83. This analysis excluded one case which, according to cancer registry data, had been 
misclassified as nasopharyngeal cancer. Weaker 
exposure–response relationships were observed between nasopharyngeal cancer and average or 
cumulative exposure, and duration of exposure 
(P
trend = 0.07, 0.03 and 0.15, respectively).
In the two other large cohort studies of indus -
trial workers, cases of nasopharyngeal cancer were fewer than expected, but the power of these studies to detect an effect on nasopharyngeal 
cancer was low and the deficits were small. In the 
first study, of British chemical workers, one death was observed when 2.0 were expected ( Coggon 
et al ., 2003 ); in the second study, no deaths were 
observed among US garment-manufacturers, where 0.96 were expected ( Pinkerton et al., 2004 ).
An excess of deaths from nasopharyngeal 
cancer was observed in a proportionate mortality analysis of the largest US cohort of embalmers 
(Hayes et al ., 1990 ) and in a Danish study of 
proportionate cancer incidence among workers 
at companies that used or manufactured formal -
dehyde ( Hansen & Olsen, 1995 ; see Table  2.2 
available at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100F/100F-24-Table2.2.pdf ).
Marsh et al. (1996)  conducted a cohort study 
in one of the plants considered in the NCI study (where five of the nine cases of nasopharyngeal 
cancer occurred). The cohort included earlier 
year of entry and was enumerated independently. Significantly increased mortality due to naso -
pharyngeal cancer was observed among formal -
dehyde-exposed workers compared with US and regional populations (Connecticut State and 
404Formaldehyde
local county). In a recent follow-up through 2003, 
Marsh et al. (2007a)  showed elevated SMRs when 
both national and local county rates were used. In addition, when conducting a case–control study nested within the cohort and including seven 
deaths from nasopharyngeal cancer, the authors 
obtained information on employment outside the formaldehyde industry and showed that five 
of these workers had been employed as a silver -
smith. However, while there was some evidence 
of effect modification by  activities as a silver -
smith (based on small numbers), confounding 
alone did not explain the relatively high number of deaths from nasopharyngeal cancer in this 
plant ( Marsh et al., 2007a ).
Two analyses have been conducted to 
re-analyse the data from the most recent update of the NCI cohort, with a focus on solid tumours 
(Hauptmann et al ., 2004 ). The first included 
an analysis of exposure category and SMR, as 
well as an analysis of Plant 1, where five of nine 
deaths from nasopharyngeal cancer occurred, compared with all other plants in the cohort 
(Marsh & Youk, 2005 ). Using their own cut-
points of exposure, the authors concluded that 
their analysis lent uncertainty to the findings 
from the NCI cohort. In another re-analysis, the 
authors further controlled for the effect of plant for the peak-exposure metric and performed 
sensitivity analyses by imputing additional cases, 
which showed instability in the risk estimates (Marsh et al., 2007b ). The authors concluded that 
an interaction between plant group and exposure makes generalization beyond Plant 1 difficult.
2.1.2  Case–control studies
The relationship between nasopharyngeal 
cancer and exposure to formaldehyde has also 
been investigated in seven case–control studies, 
five of which found elevated risks for overall exposure to formaldehyde or in higher expo -
sure categories, although not all were statis -
tically significant (see Table  2.3 available at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100F/100F-24-Table2.3.pdf ; Vaughan 
et al., 1986b ; Roush et al., 1987 ; West et al., 1993 ; 
Vaughan et al ., 2000 ; Hildesheim et al ., 2001 ). 
One study found an elevation among women, 
but not men ( Olsen et al ., 1984 ) and one found 
no evidence of an association ( Armstrong et al ., 
2000 ). Two case–control studies were consid -
ered as the most informative because of their 
size, their exposure assessment, and the evalua -
tion of potential confounders. The first, a popu -
lation-based case–control study in the USA, showed a significant association for the workers whose exposure duration had been the longest 
(OR = 2.1; 95%CI: 1.0–4.5, P
trend = 0.07), but not 
for maximum exposure ( Ptrend = 0.57) ( Vaughan 
et al ., 2000 ). When the analysis was limited to 
differentiated squamous-cell and epithelial NOS, 
there was a significant association in the highest exposure category for both duration and cumula -
tive exposure with significant exposure-response trends ( P
trend = 0.014 and 0.033, respectively). In 
the other study, conducted in Taiwan, China, 
an OR of 1.6 (95%CI: 0.91–2.9, Ptrend = 0.08) was 
found in the category with the longest dura -
tion of exposure ( Hildesheim et al ., 2001 ). For 
cumulative exposure, there was a non-significant 
elevation in the highest exposure category and 
the trend test was not significant ( P  =  0.10). In 
sub analyses that were restricted to cases and 
controls who were seropositive for antibodies 
against Epstein-Barr virus, the association 
between exposure to formaldehyde and naso -
pharyngeal cancer appeared to be stronger, with 
an OR for ever exposure of 2.7 (95%CI: 1.2–6.2). 
However, no clear dose–response pattern was observed with increasing duration of exposure, 
or with estimated cumulative exposure.
2.1.3  Meta-analyses
A meta-analysis published in 1997 included 
some but not all of the above studies, and found an overall meta-relative risk for nasopharyngeal 
405IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
cancer of 1.3 (95%CI: 1.2–1.5) ( Collins et al ., 
1997 ). From a pooled analysis including the three 
recently updated industrial cohorts ( Coggon 
et al ., 2003 ; Hauptmann et al ., 2004 ; Pinkerton 
et al ., 2004 ), Bosetti et al . (2008)  reported an 
overall SMR of 1.33 (95%CI: 0.61–2.53). A 
recently published meta-analysis included both case–control studies ( n = 6) and cohort studies 
(n = 7) ( Bachand et al., 2010 ). For the case–control 
studies, the overall OR was 1.22 (95%CI: 1.00–1.50), with the meta-regression OR no longer 
significant when limited to studies that included 
adjustment for socioeconomic status, smoking or location. The risk estimate for cohort studies was 
0.72 (95%CI: 0.40–1.29), including seven studies 
(Bachand et al ., 2010 ). For the cohort studies, 
the authors used a re-analysis of the NCI cohort 
study from which Plant 1 was left out ( Marsh & 
Youk, 2005 ).
2.2 Leukaemia
In IARC Monograph  Volume 88 ( IARC, 
2006 ) it was concluded that there was strong, 
but not sufficient evidence for the leukaemo -
genic effects of formaldehyde. Since that time, 
an update to the NCI cohort and a nested 
case–control study of workers in the funeral 
industry have been published ( Beane Freeman 
et al ., 2009 ; Hauptmann et al ., 2009 ), as well 
as three meta-analyses ( Bosetti et al ., 2008 ; 
Zhang et al ., 2009 ; Bachand et al ., 2010 ; see 
Table  2.1 online, and Table  2.5 available at 
http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/
vol100F/100F-24-Table2.5.pdf ).
2.2.1  Cohort studies
Excess mortality from leukaemia has been 
observed relatively consistently in studies of 
professional workers (i.e. embalmers, funeral 
parlour workers, pathologists and anatomists), with six mortality studies showing positive asso -
ciations ( Walrath & Fraumeni, 1983 , 1984 ; Levine et al., 1984 ; Stroup et al., 1986 ; Hayes et al., 1990 ; 
Hall et al., 1991 ) and one not ( Logue et al., 1986 ; 
see Table 2.2 online).
A weakness of the proportionate mortality 
studies among professionals has been the lack 
of exposure assessment. A recently published 
nested case–control study conducted among professionals in the funeral industry examined 
lifetime work practices and exposure in the 
funeral industry to develop metrics of expo -
sure among this group, which included dura -
tion of jobs held while embalming, number of  embalmings, average intensity of embalming and 
peak exposure ( Hauptmann et al., 2009 ). Details 
of work practices were obtained by interviews with next of kin and co-workers. Positive associ -
ations were seen – at many levels of exposure and 
for multiple exposure metrics – for deaths from 
lymphohaematopoietic malignancies of non-lymphoid origin ( n = 48). For myeloid leukaemia 
(n  =  34) the OR was 13.6 (95%CI: 1.6–119.7; 
P
trend = 0.020) for the longest duration of work in 
jobs with embalming. Because only one case was 
reported to have never embalmed, additional 
analyses were conducted in which those who reported to have embalmed ≤  500 times were 
taken as the referent group, to provide a more 
stable estimate. Results were attenuated, but still significant (OR  =  3.9; 95%CI: 1.2–12.5). [There 
was a considerable amount of missing data that 
required imputation for analyses.]
The findings for leukaemia in studies of profes -
sional workers appeared to be contradicted by the lack of such findings among industrial workers. However, some evidence for an excess of deaths 
from leukaemia has been reported in the recent 
updates of two of the three major cohort studies of industrial workers. Since the previous evalua -
tion ( IARC, 2006 ), the NCI cohort of industrial 
workers in the USA has been updated with an additional ten years of mortality data resulting 
in 123 deaths from leukaemia, including 48 from 
myeloid leukaemia ( Beane Freeman et al ., 2009 ). 
This update extended the mortality follow-up 
406Formaldehyde
through 2004 and included additional deaths 
before 1994 that had not been previously consid -
ered. Risk estimates from follow-up through 2004 were diminished for leukaemia and myeloid leukaemia compared with the follow-up 
through 1994 ( Hauptmann et al ., 2003 ), when 
both conditions had been significantly associ -
ated with increasing peak-exposure and average intensity of exposure to formaldehyde. As in 
the previous analysis of leukaemia, the associa -
tion in the most recent update was stronger for 
myeloid leukaemia and peak exposure than for 
lymphatic leukaemia and for other metrics of exposure ( Beane Freeman et al ., 2009 ). However, 
because the last known exposure occurred in 1980 and median follow-up was over 40 years, the authors not only examined risks at the end 
of follow-up in 2004, but also assessed associa -
tions over time by extending follow-up in yearly 
increments. Risks appeared to be highest before 
1980, but only achieved statistical significance 
in the mid-1990s, when a sufficient number of deaths had accrued. Additional analyses with 
time since first exposure and time since first high 
peak-exposure indicated that risks were highest during the first twenty-five years. Patterns were 
similar, but attenuated, for average intensity of 
exposure; no association was observed with cumulative exposure.
Mortality from leukaemia was also found 
to be in excess in an update of the study of US garment workers exposed to formaldehyde 
(Pinkerton et al ., 2004 ). A small and statisti -
cally non-significant excess was observed for the 
entire cohort in comparison with rates among 
the general population (SMR  =  1.09; 95%CI: 
0.7–1.63). This excess was somewhat stronger for myeloid leukaemia (SMR  =  1.44; 95%CI: 0.80–
2.37), which is consistent with the findings from 
the study of industrial workers in the USA and several of the studies of medical professionals 
and embalmers. The excess was also stronger 
among workers with a longer duration of expo -
sure and longer follow-up, and among those who had been employed early in the study period when exposures to formaldehyde were believed 
to be highest. The positive associations observed 
in the subgroup analyses presented in the study of US garment workers were based on a relatively 
small number of deaths, and were thus not statis -
tically stable.
The updated study of British industrial 
workers found no excess mortality for leukaemia 
among all workers exposed to formaldehyde (SMR = 0.91; 95%CI: 0.62–1.29) or among those 
with the highest exposure (SMR = 0.71; 95%CI: 
0.31–1.39) ( Coggon et al., 2003 ). The lack of posi -
tive findings in this study is difficult to reconcile 
with the findings from the studies of garment 
workers and industrial workers in the USA, and with the results of studies on professionals 
exposed to formaldehyde. This British study is 
a relatively large, high-quality study with suffi -
ciently long follow-up to have had a reason -
able chance to detect an excess of deaths from leukaemia. It did not examine specifically the risk for myeloid leukaemia, which represented 
the strongest finding in the studies of garment 
workers and industrial workers in the USA and in several of the studies of medical professionals 
and funeral workers.
2.2.2  Case–control studies
Three case–control studies evaluated expo -
sure to formaldehyde and risk for leukaemia (Linos et al., 1990 ; Partanen et al., 1993 ; Blair et al., 
2001 ; Table 2.5 online). However, the numbers of 
exposed cases were few, and no significant eleva -
tions of risk were found.
2.2.3  Meta-analyses
A meta-analysis published in 2004 for ‘ever 
exposure’ to formaldehyde and leukaemia included eighteen studies and presented sepa -
rate analyses by type of job: for industrial 
workers, the mRR was 0.9 (95%CI: 0.8–1.0); for 
407IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
embalmers 1.6 (95%CI: 1.2–2.0); and for patholo -
gists and anatomists 1.4 (95%CI: 1.0–1.9), with an 
overall mRR of 1.1 (95%CI: 1.0–1.2) ( Collins & 
Lineker, 2004 ). In another meta-analysis, anal -
ysis was restricted to 13 cohort or proportionate mortality studies and similar results were found, 
with a pooled RR based on the weighted average of the SMRs for leukaemia among industrial 
workers of 0.9 (95%CI: 0.75–1.07), based on 122 
deaths, and of 1.39 (95%CI: 1.15–1.68) among professionals, based on 106 deaths ( Bosetti et al., 
2008 ). A further meta-analysis differed from 
these two previous ones by excluding all propor -
tionate mortality studies and including the most 
recent update of the NCI cohort ( Bachand et al ., 
2010 ). For leukaemia overall, a risk estimate of 
1.05 (95%CI: 0.93–1.20) was calculated for ‘ever exposure’, based on 15 studies with the use of 
a fixed-effects model. For myeloid leukaemia, the calculated mRR was  1.09 (95%CI: 0.84–
1.40, based on three studies) and for lymphatic 
leukaemia the mRR was 1.11 (95%CI: 0.81–1.52, based on two studies).
Zhang et al . (2009)  published a meta-anal -
ysis that included 15 cohort or case–control studies. The authors selected only studies where 
it was clear that the workers had been exposed 
to formaldehyde. In contrast to the other meta-analyses, this one used one exposure metric from 
each study and considered the highest exposure 
category for calculating the mRR. For leukaemia, the mRR was 1.54 (95%CI: 1.18–2.00). In addi -
tion, a separate analysis of myeloid leukaemia – for the six studies that reported it – found an mRR of 1.90 (95%CI: 1.31–2.76).
2.3 Cancer of the nasal sinuses
2.3.1  Cohort studies
An analysis of proportionate cancer inci -
dence among industrial workers in Denmark 
showed an increased risk for squamous-cell 
carcinomas ( Hansen & Olsen, 1995 , 1996 ). No excess of mortality from sinonasal cancer was observed in the three recently updated studies of 
industrial and garment workers in the USA, and 
of chemical workers in the United Kingdom (see Table 2.1 online; Coggon et al., 2003 ; Hauptmann 
et al., 2004 ; Pinkerton et al., 2004 ).
2.3.2  Case–control studies
The association between exposure to formal -
dehyde and the risk for sinonasal cancer has been 
evaluated in six case–control studies that prima -
rily focused on formaldehyde (see Table  2.4 
available at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/
Monographs/vol100F/100F-24-Table2.4.pdf ; 
Olsen et al ., 1984 ; Hayes et al ., 1986 ; Olsen & 
Asnaes, 1986 ; Vaughan et al., 1986a ; Roush et al., 
1987 ; Luce et al ., 1993 ; Pesch et al ., 2008 ). Four 
of these six studies reported an increased risk 
(Olsen et al ., 1984 ; Hayes et al ., 1986 ; Vaughan 
et al., 1986a ; Luce et al., 1993 ).
2.3.3  Pooled analysis
Four of the cohort studies contributed to a 
pooled analysis that collated occupational data 
from 12 case–control investigations ( Luce et al ., 
2002 ). After adjustment for known occupational 
confounders, this analysis showed an increased risk for adenocarcinoma associated with high 
exposure (> 1 ppm) to formaldehyde in both men (OR, 3.0; 95%CI: 1.5–5.7) and women (OR, 6.3; 
95%CI: 2.0–19.7). An exposure–response trend 
was observed in relation to an index of cumu -
lative exposure. There was some evidence of an 
association with squamous-cell carcinoma.
[Most epidemiological studies of sinonasal 
cancer have not distinguished between tumours that arise in the nose and those that develop in 
the nasal sinuses. Thus, any effect on the risk for nasal cancer specifically would tend to be 
diluted if there were no corresponding effect on 
the risk for cancer in the sinuses and could mask its detection, particularly in cohort studies that 
408Formaldehyde
have relatively low statistical power. However, 
the apparent discrepancy between the results of 
the case–control as compared with the cohort 
studies might also reflect residual confounding by wood dust in the former. Almost all of the 
formaldehyde-exposed cases in the case–control 
studies were also exposed to wood dust, which resulted in a high relative risk, particularly for 
adenocarcinomas.]
2.4 Other cancers
Several studies have identified statisti -
cally significant positive associations between exposure to formaldehyde and cancer at other 
sites, including the oral cavity, oro-and hypo-pharynx, larynx, lung, brain, pancreas, Hodgkin 
lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. However, the 
results are inconsistent (see Tables  2.4 and  2.5 online; Table  2.6 available at http://mono -
graphs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100F/100F-24-Table2.6.pdf , and Table  2.7 available at 
http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/
vol100F/100F-24-Table2.7.pdf ).
2.5 Synthesis
The Working Group noted one industrial 
cohort study with both a strong overall asso -
ciation between exposure to formaldehyde and 
nasopharyngeal cancer, and the most elevated risks in the highest exposure category. Positive 
associations were also observed in many of the 
case–control studies, in particular those of larger size and higher-quality exposure assessment. 
While there was no association observed in the 
two other large industrial cohort studies, the expected number of cases in those studies was 
quite small. It is concluded that occupational 
exposure to formaldehyde causes nasopharyn -
geal cancer in humans. The Working Group 
noted that it was unlikely that confounding or 
bias could explain the observed association.Elevated risks of leukaemia have been 
consistently observed in proportionate mortality studies of professionals exposed to formalde -
hyde (i.e. embalmers, workers in the funeral 
industry, pathologists and anatomists). Results 
from a nested case–control study of workers in the funeral industry show elevated risks for 
many measures of exposure, which are strongest 
for myeloid leukaemia. In two of the three large industrial cohort studies positive associations 
were observed for leukaemia, which were some -
what stronger for myeloid leukaemia. It is diffi -
cult to reconcile the lack of association observed in the third industrial cohort study with the 
overall positive associations in the others. However, there seems to be no strong evidence 
that confounding or bias explains the posi -
tive associations seen in multiple settings. On 
balance, the Working Group concluded that the 
epidemiologic evidence shows that occupational 
exposure to formaldehyde causes leukaemia.
Many case–control studies show positive 
associations for exposure to formaldehyde and sinonasal cancer, some with evidence of an exposure–response pattern. However, many 
of these cases were also exposed to wood dust, 
which was strongly associated with sinonasal cancer in these studies. The industrial cohort 
studies show no such association, which may be 
due to lack of statistical power, or could indicate that uncontrolled confounding to wood dust 
partially explains the observed associations in 
the case–control studies. The Working Group could not rule out the possibility of residual 
confounding in the case–control studies and 
noted the discordant results between the cohort and case–control studies.
409IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
3. Cancer in Experimental Animals
Carcinogenicity studies with mice, rats and 
hamsters exposed to formaldehyde by inhalation, 
via the drinking-water, or through the skin were 
reviewed in IARC Monograph  Volume 88 ( IARC, 
2006 ). Results of adequately conducted carcino -
genicity studies are summarized in Table  3.1 . 
There have been no additional carcinogenicity studies in experimental animals reported since 
the previous review.
3.1 Inhalation
In one inhalation study in B6C3F1 mice, 
formaldehyde marginally increased the inci -
dence of squamous cell carcinomas of the nasal 
cavity in males. The incidence of lymphoma in females exposed to 14.3 ppm (27/121) was also 
marginally increased ( P = 0.06) when compared 
(pair-wise) with controls (19/121) ( CIIT, 1981 ; 
Kerns et al., 1983a , b; Gibson, 1984 ).
In six studies ( Swenberg et al ., 1980 ; CIIT, 
1981 ; Albert et al ., 1982 ; Kerns et al ., 1983a , b; 
Gibson, 1984 ; Sellakumar et al ., 1985 ; Feron, 
et al ., 1988 ; Woutersen et al ., 1989 ; Monticello 
et al ., 1996 ; Kamata et al ., 1997 ) in different 
strains of rats (F344, Wistar, and Sprague-Dawley), there were treatment-related increases 
in tumours of the nasal cavity (primarily squa -
mous-cell carcinomas but also squamous-cell 
papillomas, polypoid adenomas, carcinomas, 
rhabdomyo sarcomas, adenocarcinomas, and 
mixed/combined tumours). In one study 
(CIIT, 1981 ), the incidences of undifferentiated 
leukaemia [Fischer rat leukaemia, as indicated 
in the report] were 12/120 (control), 17/120 (2 
ppm), 16/120 (5.6 ppm) and 7/120 (14.3 ppm) in 
females; there was a marked decrease in survival in the animals exposed to the high dose. Based 
on a survival-adjusted analysis, the incidence of 
leukaemia in females exposed to 14.3 ppm was increased compared with controls ( P =  0 . 00 5 6 ;  Tarone-extension of the Cox test; level of signifi -
cance, P < 0.0167). [The Working Group noted 
that this type of leukaemia is a very common, spontaneously occurring neoplasm in the F344 rat strain].
3.2 Oral administration (drinking-
water)
In one drinking-water study in male Wistar 
rats, there was a treatment-related increase 
in fore-stomach squamous-cell papillomas 
(Takahashi et al ., 1986 ). Another study in male 
and female Wistar rats did not report any increase 
in tumours ( Til et al., 1989 ).
In a study with life-long exposure to formalde -
hyde, beginning in utero  (transplacentally), there 
was an increased incidence of smooth-muscle 
tumours of the small intestine  (leiomyosarcoma) 
in female offspring ( Soffritti et al ., 1989 ). In 
another study in male and female rats, increased 
incidences of total malignant tumours, haemat -
opoietic tumours, and interstitial-cell adenomas 
were observed in males ( Soffritti et al., 1989 , 2002 ). 
[The Working Group reaffirmed the concerns of the previous Working Group ( IARC, 2006 ) 
regarding the pooling of all ‘leukaemias’ diag -
nosed as lymphoblastic leukaemias and lympho -
sarcomas, immunoblastic lymphosarcomas, and “other types” of leukaemia and haemolympho -
reticular sarcomas. Also noted were the lack of reporting of non-neoplastic lesions and historical control data, and the numerous discrepancies 
in tumour incidence between the first ( Soffritti 
et al ., 1989 ) and second report ( Soffritti et al ., 
2002 ) of the results of this study].
3.3 Skin application
In one study in male and female hairless Oslo 
mice, topical application of 10% formaldehyde in water reduced the latency of 7,12-dimethylbenz[ a]
anthracene-induced skin tumours ( Iversen, 
1986 ).

design, significance of tumour findings and laboratory-control incidences. 
The Working Group also noted that 
leukaemias included three types, diagnosed as lymphoblastic leukaemias 
and lymphosarcomas, immunoblastic 
lymphosarcomas, and other types of leukaemias and haemolymphoreticular 
sarcomas.  
Increased incidence of a variety of benign

tumours was also reported. The stomach 
tumours in treated groups represented single occurrences of neoplasm of different

4. Other Relevant Data
In IARC Monograph  Volume 88 ( IARC, 
2006 ) mechanistic considerations supported a 
role for cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in formal -
dehyde-induced nasal tissue carcinogenesis. 
With regards to leukaemia, it was unclear to the 
Working Group at the time how this reactive 
compound could penetrate to the bone marrow, and no animal model of formaldehyde-induced 
leukaemia was available.
The discussion below focuses on mechanistic 
issues related to the potential causal association between formaldehyde inhalation and hema -
tological cancers, and includes considerations 
on the mechanism underlying nasal carcino -
genesis in laboratory animals and humans. A more detailed review can be found in Volume 88 (IARC, 2006 ).
4.1 Absorption, distribution, 
metabolism, and excretion
One-carbon metabolism is central to many 
biological processes, including the biosynthesis 
of purines and thymidine – essential compo -
nents of nucleic acids –, the biosynthesis of 
certain amino acids, and the demethylation of 
a variety of important biological compounds 
that are central to cell function and survival. Formaldehyde is an intermediate in the one-
carbon pool and is present in measurable 
concentrations in all metabolically active cells and tissues ( Heck et al ., 1982 , 1985 ; Casanova 
et al ., 1988 ). In aqueous solution, formaldehyde 
is rapidly converted to its diol form, methanediol (formaldehyde hydrate, CH
2(OH)2, methylene 
glycol), which enters in a dynamic equilibrium 
with formaldehyde. The concentration of the diol 
and that of formaldehyde depend on the precise conditions (temperature, pH, formaldehyde 
concentration) under which the reaction occurs 
(Walker, 1964 ). Importantly, methanediol, with a molecular weight of only 48, can readily pene -
trate into tissue ( Fox et al ., 1985 ). Thus, formal -
dehyde may reach the bone-marrow through the blood as methanediol, where it equilibrates again to reactive formaldehyde. Further investigation 
of this equilibrium in living biological systems 
is warranted.
The absorption of formaldehyde occurs 
readily in the upper respiratory tract ( Casanova 
et al ., 1991 ; Kimbell et al ., 2001a , b). Once 
inhaled, formaldehyde can react directly with 
mucus or with macromolecular cellular compo -
nents including proteins and nucleic acids; it 
can be incorporated into biological molecules 
through folate-dependent enzymatic processes; 
it can be oxidized to formic acid or to carbon dioxide through enzymatic processes dependent 
on formaldehyde dehydrogenase, aldehyde dehy -
drogenase and, in limited situations, catalase 
(Hedberg et al ., 2002 ), or itcan be exhaled. It 
has been estimated that as much as 22–42% of inhaled formaldehyde may be removed by mucus flow ( Schlosser, 1999 ).
Formaldehyde reacts readily and reversibly 
with amino groups to form Schiff bases, and with sulfhydryl groups resulting in the forma -
tion of S -hydroxymethylglutathione, which is 
oxidized by alcohol dehydrogenase-3 (ADH3) to S-formylgluthahione. The latter is further 
metabolized by S -formylgluthione hydrolase to 
generate formate and gluthione. The formate can also be formed non-enzymatically ( Hedberg 
et al ., 2002 ). Incubation of 0.1–5.0 mM formal -
dehyde with reduced glutathione in solution followed by addition to deoxyguanosine or to calf-
thymus DNA leads to the formation of the rela -
tively stable adduct S- [1-(N
2-deoxyguanosinyl)
methyl]glutathione ( Lu et al ., 2009 ). This adduct 
may form endogenously, as both formaldehyde 
and reduced glutathione are present in reason -
ably high concentrations within cells. It may 
also serve as a biomarker to study the penetra -
tion of inhaled radio-labelled formaldehyde, 
to distinguish endogenous from exogenous 
417IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
formaldehyde-derived adducts. Whether this 
could also be a mechanism by which inhaled 
formaldehyde could lead to bone-marrow toxicity 
has not been studied.
Red blood cells have relatively high levels of 
enzymes that rapidly metabolize formaldehyde. The concentration of formaldehyde in the blood of six human volunteers did not change imme -
diately after exposure to 1.9 ppm [2.34 mg/m
3] 
formaldehyde for 40 minute ( Heck et al ., 1985 ), 
and no change in formic acid concentration was observed in the urine of medical students over a three-week period during which they 
were exposed to air concentrations <  0.5 ppm 
[0.62 mg/m
3] (Gottschling et al., 1984 ). No statis -
tically significant change in the concentration of 
formaldehyde in blood was found after inhala -
tion of this substance at 1.9 ppm [2.34 mg/m3] for 
40 minute by six human volunteers; at 14.4 ppm [17.8 mg /m
3] for two hours in rats ( Heck et al ., 
1985 ); and at 6 ppm [7.4 mg/m3] for six hours/
day, five days per week, for four weeks in Rhesus monkeys ( Casanova et al ., 1988 ). Blood was 
drawn approximately 7 min and 45 hours after 
the end of the exposure period, from monkeys 
whose blood levels were 1.84  ±  0.15 µg/g and 
2.04 ± 0.40 µg/g, respectively. However, there are methodological concerns with these studies. In 
the monkey study three animals were used to 
determine control levels and three others were exposed to formaldehyde. The mean levels were 
then compared. It would have been better if the 
monkeys had served as their own control. A similar lack of change in formaldehyde levels was 
reported in rats (2.25 ± 0.07 vs  2.24 ± 0.07 µg/g 
blood) and humans (2.77 ± 0.28 vs  2.61 ± 0.14 µg/g 
blood; approximately 0.1 mM) exposed for short periods to 14.4 and 1.9 ppm, respectively ( Heck 
et al ., 1985 ; Casanova et al ., 1988 ; IARC, 2006 ). 
[The Working Group noted that, given the short half-life for formaldehyde observed in rodents, 
the time from end-of-exposure to sampling in monkeys and in humans was likely too long; this 
could not be evaluated for rats].Studies of the uptake of radio-labelled formal -
dehyde by inhalation, ingestion and through the skin do not provide information that would help 
to determine whether unreacted formaldehyde reaches the bone marrow, because it is rapidly 
taken up in the one-carbon pool and incorpo -
rated in macromolecules. There was no evidence 
of the formation of formaldehyde-specific DNA–
protein crosslinks in the bone marrow of Rhesus 
monkeys exposed for six hours to 0.7, 2.0 and 6.0 ppm formaldehyde ( Heck & Casanova, 2004 ), or 
in rats, including glutathione (GSH)-depleted rats, exposed to concentrations of formalde -
hyde up to 10 ppm ( Casanova-Schmitz et al ., 
1984 ; Casanova & Heck, 1987 ). The formation of 
formaldehyde-DNA adducts was demonstrated in lymphocytes of smokers ( Wang et al ., 2009 ). 
In this study, liquid chromatography-electro -
spray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry was used to quantify the adduct N
6-hydroxymethyl-
deoxyadenosine ( N6-HOMe-dAdo) in leukocyte-
DNA samples from 32 smokers (≥ 10 cigarettes 
per day) and 30 non-smokers. This adduct would 
be expected to be formed upon exposure to formaldehyde. N
6-HOMe-dAdo was detected 
in 29 of the 32 samples from smokers, but in 
only 7 of the 30 samples from non-smokers 
(P < 0.001). These findings would support a role 
for inhaled formaldehyde in causing the DNA 
adducts that may ultimately lead to smoking-
associated leukaemia. The authors caution that the observed adducts may result from cigarette-
smoke components other than formaldehyde 
– such as 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) or nicotine, which may be 
metabolized to formaldehyde within the cell – 
or from other sources, rather than reflecting the actual penetration of inhaled formaldehyde to 
lymphocytes.
Rietbrock (1965) reported that the half-life in 
plasma of formaldehyde injected intravenously in the rat was about one minute. [Assuming a 
similar half-life of formaldehyde in humans, this would be sufficient time for inhaled formaldehyde 
418Formaldehyde
to reach the blood and circulate to the bone 
marrow in humans].
4.2 Toxic effects
Formaldehyde produces irritation of the 
nose and pharynx in humans and laboratory 
animals under a variety of circumstances. There 
appears to be a large inter-individual variation in the human response to the irritating effects 
of formaldehyde. Under controlled exposure 
conditions, symptoms of irritation were noted by healthy individuals exposed to formaldehyde 
concentrations of 2–3 ppm during periods that 
varied between 40 minute and three hours (for details, see Table 30 in IARC Monograph  Volume 
88 (IARC, 2006 )).
Formaldehyde is a known cause of allergic 
contact dermatitis and, somewhat more contro -
versial, of occupational asthma. Nasal biopsies of workers chronically exposed to formaldehyde showed chronic inflammation, loss of cilia, mild 
dysplasia, hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia, 
although the latter finding has been inconsistent and may have been confounded by other expo -
sures, such as to wood dust ( IARC, 2006 ).
The cytotoxicity of formaldehyde has been 
confirmed in numerous in-vitro systems. 
Irritation of the nasal and upper respiratory tract 
is also noted in animal studies. Dose-dependent pathological findings include inflammation, 
hyperplasia, degenerative changes, necrosis and 
squamous metaplasia.
Recently, a finding relevant to the possible 
involvement of formaldehyde in leukaemo -
genesis was reported by Zhang et al . (2010) . 
Their study showed that colony formation by 
colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage 
(CFU-GM) progenitor cells is inhibited in cell cultures exposed to formaldehyde at toxico -
logically relevant concentrations. Furthermore, colony formation by the more primitive CFU-granulocyte- erythrocyte-monocyte-
megakaryocyte (CFU-GEMM) progenitors, which give rise to formation of all myeloid cells, 
showed a linear negative dose–response when 
treated with formaldehyde. These effects were 
observed at formaldehyde concentrations of 100–200 μM [3–6 μg/mL], which are toxicologi -
cally relevant since background levels of formal -
dehyde in human blood have been reported to be 50–100 μM [1.5–3 μg/mL] ( Heck et al ., 1985 ; 
Casanova et al., 1988 ). Because the CFU-GEMM 
multipotent myeloid progenitor cells and the pluripotent stem cells are the target cells for 
leukaemogenesis and are converted to leukaemic 
stem cells in acute myeloid leukaemia, the finding that formaldehyde damages these cells in vitro  
adds some weight to the notion that it may be associated with myeloid leukaemia.
4.3 Genetic and related effects
The genotoxicity of formaldehyde was thor -
oughly reviewed in IARC Monograph  Volume 88 
(IARC, 2006 ). Genotoxicity has been observed in 
vitro  in many systems with multiple endpoints.
4.3.1  Humans
Micronucleus formation has been repeat -
edly reported to occur in cells of the nasal and 
oral mucosa of formaldehyde-exposed humans. 
The outcome of studies on induction of micro -
nuclei, sister chromatid exchange and chromo -
somal aberrations in the lymphocytes of exposed humans – which is pertinent to the question concerning the potential of formaldehyde to 
cause lympho-haematopoietic cancer – has been 
less consistent (see Table 4.1 ).
DNA–protein crosslinks in circulating 
white blood cells were found to be higher in 12 workers exposed to formaldehyde in an anatomy department and a pathology institute than in 
eight controls ( P  =  0.03) ( Shaham et al ., 1996 ). 
The number of crosslinks tended to be higher in 
workers who had been exposed longer (exposure 
duration, 2–31 years). Smoking had no effect. In a

subsequent study, Shaham et al . (2003)  reported 
an increase in the number of DNA–protein 
crosslinks in lymphocytes and in serum concen -
trations of the p53 protein in hospital pathology-
department workers. The exposed subjects were 
assigned to a high-exposure subgroup (mean 
formaldehyde concentration in air, 2.24 ppm) and a low-exposure subgroup (mean, 0.4 ppm), 
based on personal sampling and field sampling 
for 15-minute periods on typical working days. The control group consisted of personnel of 
the administrative sections in the hospital. The 
amount of protein–cross-linked DNA was statis -
tically significantly higher in the exposed group 
than in the controls (0.20 vs  0.14; these values 
are the ratios between protein-bound DNA – 
precipitable with sodium dodecyl sulfate – and 
total DNA) after controlling for age, smoking 
and other factors. Very little difference in DNA–protein crosslink levels was observed between 
the high- and low-exposure groups (0.20 vs  
0.19); or between workers with > 16 years or < 16 
years of exposure (0.20 vs  0.19). The percentage 
of formaldehyde-exposed male workers who had pantropic p53-protein (wild-type plus mutant p53) concentrations in serum higher than 
150 pg/ml was statistically significantly greater 
than in the control group (54.8% vs  36.5%, 
P < 0.05; this difference was not seen in female 
workers). Formaldehyde-exposed workers with DNA–protein crosslink levels above the median had a significantly greater likelihood of having 
p53 concentrations in serum above 150 pg/ml. 
[The Working Group noted that the rationale for using a p53-protein level of 150 pg/ml as a 
cut-point was based upon previous experience 
with this assay; no reason is given for using 16 years as the cut-point between longer/shorter 
exposure. Questions have also been raised about 
the persistence of DNA–protein crosslinks, which are thought to be rapidly repaired within 
the cell ( Schmid & Speit, 2007 )]. In an earlier 
study, Casanova-Schmitz et al . (1984)  failed 
to observe DNA–protein crosslinks in bone marrow of Fischer-344 rats exposed to [14C]- and 
[3H]-formaldehyde.
Compared with matched controls, pathology/
anatomy workers from five hospitals, who 
were exposed to mean formaldehyde concen -
trations of 2.0 ppm (range, <  0.1 to 20.4 ppm) 
during 15 minute, or to 0.1 ppm (range < 0.1 to 
0.7 ppm) during 8 hours, showed a statistically significant increase in bi-nucleated cells and 
in mono-centromeric micronucleus formation 
in a cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus assay combined with fluorescence in situ hybridization 
(FISH) ( Orsière et al., 2006 ).
A higher frequency of micronuclei was found 
in exfoliated nasal and oral cells of students with short-term exposure (3  hours per day; 
3  days per week, for 8 weeks) to an average of 0.508  ±  0.299 mg/m
3 formaldehyde, compared 
with controls ( Ying et al., 1997 , 1999 ). No increase 
in micronucleus formation or in the level of sister chromatid exchange (SCE) was observed in lymphocytes. Ye et al . (2005)  reported a 
comparative analysis of 18 workers involved for various periods (mean, 8.5  years; range, 1–15 years) in a formaldehyde-manufacturing 
process, 16 waiters exposed for 12 weeks to an 
indoor source of formaldehyde during interior renovations, and a control group of 23 students; 
all were non-smokers. Average formaldehyde 
exposure-concentrations were 0.011 mg/m
3 for 
the student controls; 0.107 mg/m3 for the waiters; 
and 0.99 mg/m3 for the formaldehyde-plant 
workers. There was a statistically significantly 
higher frequency of micronuclei in nasal mucosal 
cells and of SCE in peripheral lymphocytes in the workers at the formaldehyde-manufacturing 
plant, but not in the waiters, although both groups 
were exposed to formaldehyde at comparable concentrations ( Table  4.1 ). The result is in line 
with the much longer exposure duration for the plant workers. The same authors ( Ye et al., 2005 ) 
reported an increase in B-cells and changes in 
the ratios between lymphocyte subsets, similar 
to those reported by Madison et al . (1991)  in an 
424Formaldehyde
Alaskan community subject to acute formal -
dehyde exposure (estimated at 2–5 ppm) for a 
few days. Blood analyses were done three years 
after the accident. Total white blood cell counts and total lymphocyte counts did not differ from 
those in the control community in Alaska, also 
measured three years later ( Madison et al., 1991 ).
An increase in SCE and other genotoxic 
effects were observed in the lymphocytes of workers with long-term exposure to formalde -
hyde ( Costa et al ., 2008 ). Thirty workers from 
four pathology/anatomy hospital units and 30 matched controls were included in the study. Compared with the control group, statistically 
significant effects were seen in SCE (6.13 ± 0.29 
vs 4.49 ± 0.16 SCE/cell, P  < 0.05), micronucleus 
frequency (in 1000 bi-nucleated cells: 5.47 ± 0.76 
‰ vs 3.27 ± 0.69 ‰, P = 0.003) and tail length in 
the comet assay (60.0 ± 2.31 μm vs  41.85 ± 1.97 
μm, P < 0.05). A statistically significant positive 
correlation was found between formaldehyde 
exposure levels and micronucleus frequency and tail length. The mean formaldehyde exposure 
was 0.44 ppm (range, 0.04–1.58 ppm). None of 
the observed effects were related to the duration of exposure.
No genotoxic effects were observed in a study 
of 36 laboratory workers at a cancer-research institute who were exposed to 4.9–268.7 μg/m
3 
formaldehyde. There was a direct relationship 
between formaldehyde exposure levels and 
the presence of a formaldehyde human serum-albumin (FA-HSA) conjugate. The genotoxic 
endpoints measured were SCE, micronuclei and 
chromosome aberrations, but these did not show significantly elevated levels ( Pala et al ., 2008 ). 
Although a small study, its strength is its linkage to a biological marker of formaldehyde exposure.
Hayes et al . (1997)  evaluated O
6-Alkyl-
guanine-DNA–alkyltransferase (AGT) activity 
as a measure of DNA-repair capacity in 
blood lymphocytes of 23 science students in a mortuary, before and after a nine-week period 
of classroom exposure to approximately 1.5 ppm formaldehyde. A statistically significant finding 
was that more students had a reduction in AGT 
activity than an increase. There was no clear link 
between the extent of exposure to formaldehyde and AGT activity.
Zhang et al. (2010)  cultured myeloid progen -
itor cells from the peripheral blood of formalde -
hyde-exposed workers and controls and measured 
leukaemia-specific chromosomal changes. In a 
subset of ten of the most highly exposed subjects in their study, monosomy (loss) of chromosome 7 
and trisomy (gain) of chromosome 8 were signif -
icantly elevated in the myeloid progenitor cells of 
formaldehyde-exposed workers compared with 
the same phenomena in 12 unexposed controls. 
The loss of chromosome 7 and gain of chromo -
some 8 were examined because they are among 
the most frequent cytogenetic changes observed 
in myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes; these events have been shown to be 
affected by exposure to the established human 
leukemogen, benzene. [The Working Group noted that the study is small and needs to be 
replicated].
4.3.2  Experimental systems
(a) In-vivo studies (laboratory animals)
Studies on a variety of genotoxic endpoints 
in laboratory animals inhaling formaldehyde 
have generally shown effects in the nasal tissues 
of these animals ( IARC, 2006 ). Much less 
consistent have been the findings of genotoxic 
effects in the blood lymphocytes from exposed 
animals. Among the recent studies, Im et al . 
(2006)  reported genotoxicity based on a positive 
result in the comet assay in the lymphocytes of rats inhaling 5 or 10 ppm formaldehyde for two 
weeks, six hours/day, five days/week. In contrast, in a review of their own work and of the litera -
ture, Speit et al . (2009)  concluded that there was 
no evidence of systemic genotoxic effects in labo -
ratory animals inhaling formaldehyde. Their 
own negative studies in this review focused on 
425IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
lymphocyte genotoxicity, measured as micronu -
clei, SCE, and DNA-breakage – the latter deter -
mined with a sensitive form of the comet assay 
– in rats exposed for four weeks (six hours/day, five days/week) to formaldehyde concentrations 
of 0.5, 1, 2, 6, 10 and 15 ppm.
More recently, DNA strand-breaks were 
induced by formaldehyde in vivo , in mouse liver 
(maternal and fetal), and in lung cells in the rat 
(Wang & Liu, 2006 ; Sul et al., 2007 ).
(b) In-vitro studies
The spectrum of mutations related to exposure 
to formaldehyde in vitro  and in vivo  was presented 
and discussed in IARC Monograph  Volume 88 
(IARC, 2006 ). In-vitro studies since then have 
expanded the wide range of potential mutagenic mechanisms, to include the hydroxymethyla -
tion of DNA and DNA-microsatellite instability (Zhong & Que Hee, 2004; Wang et al., 2007 ).
The evidence of formaldehyde-induced 
mutations in various experimental systems is consistent, encompassing both clastogenic effects and direct DNA mutation. Formaldehyde 
showed mutagenic potential in several bacterial 
systems, both with and without S9 activation. Formaldehyde induced deletions, point muta -
tions, insertions, and cell transformation in in-vitro assays with mammalian cells ( IARC, 
2006 ).
Formaldehyde-induced DNA strand-breaks 
(SSB) have been demonstrated in several mammalian cell systems, including hepato -
cytes, lymphosarcoma cells, and epithelial cells from the rat, leukaemia L1210 cells from the mouse, and lung/bronchial epithelial cells, skin 
fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and peripheral blood 
lymphocytes from humans ( IARC, 2006 ).
Chromosomal aberrations, micronuclei and 
SCE were all increased in vitro  in numerous 
rodent and human primary cells and cell lines treated with formaldehyde ( IARC, 2006 ). 
Consistent with these findings, more recent data show increased numbers of chromosomal aberrations in Syrian hamster embryo cells, and chromosomal aberrations and SCE in Chinese 
hamster ovary and embryo cells ( Hikiba et al ., 
2005 , Hagiwara et al., 2006 ; Lorenti Garcia et al., 
2009 ).
Further evidence of formaldehyde-induced 
micronucleus formation was obtained in studies 
with human lymphocytes isolated from whole-
blood cultures exposed in vitro  to formaldehyde, 
44 hours after the start of the culture ( Schmid 
& Speit, 2007 ). Both micronuclei and SCE were 
induced upon in-vitro treatment of Chinese 
hamster V79 lung epithelial cells with formal -
dehyde ( Speit et al ., 2007 ). In a recent study, 
SCE was induced in A549 human lung cells and V79 Chinese hamster cells following incubation with 0.1 mM [3 μg/mL] or higher concentra -
tions of formaldehyde. One hour after the addi -
tion of the agent to the A549 cells, the culture medium still retained the capacity to produce 
SCE in non-exposed V79 cells, suggesting that 
genotoxicity persists despite the high reactivity of formaldehyde with macromolecules in the 
culture medium ( Neuss & Speit, 2008 ). When the 
formaldehyde-exposed A549 cells were washed 
and then suspended in fresh culture medium 
containing the V79 cells, SCE formation was 
not observed in the latter. [The authors present no evidence that it is formaldehyde itself that 
persists, rather than a formaldehyde product 
that is responsible for genotoxicity. The Working Group noted that there is no reason to preclude 
the transfer of formaldehyde from cell to cell].
Formaldehyde has also been reported to 
interfere with DNA repair. A recent finding that chicken DT40 cells deficient in the FANC/BRCA 
(Fanconi’s anaemia complementation groups/breast cancer A) pathway are hypersensitive to 
formaldehyde in plasma, is consistent with a 
role for this pathway in repairing DNA–protein cross-links caused by formaldehyde. The DT40 
mutants were also more sensitive to acetaldehyde, 
but not to acrolein and other aldehydes ( Ridpath 
et al ., 2007 ). Endogenous formaldehyde may be 
426Formaldehyde
important in producing leukaemia in patients 
with Fanconi’s anaemia, a genetic disorder that 
is characterized by progressive pancytopenia. 
DT40 cells with deficient repair mechanisms have also been shown to be more sensitive to 
other cross-linking agents such as cisplatin, a 
myelotoxic chemotherapeutic agent that leads to pancytopenia and acute myelogenous leukaemia 
(AML) ( Nojima et al., 2005 ).
4.4 Mechanistic considerations
4.4.1  Cancer of the nasopharynx and nasal 
sinuses
Mechanistic evidence supporting a causal 
relation between inhalation of formaldehyde and 
induction of cancer of the nasopharynx and nasal 
sinuses is based on the chemical reactivity of formaldehyde in producing DNA–protein cross-
links, and its genotoxicity in vitro  and in vivo , 
including in the nasal cells of exposed humans. 
Computational fluid-dynamic models of formal -
dehyde in the nasal passages of rats, monkeys and humans have generally been accurate in predicting the area in the nose with the highest 
number of DNA–protein crosslinks ( Georgieva 
et al ., 2003 ). Local effects in the nasal passages, 
genotoxicity, and cell-proliferation rate appear to be the major determinants of nasal carcino -
genicity after exposure to formaldehyde.
4.4.2  Leukaemia
The findings reviewed in IARC Monograph  
Volume 88 ( IARC, 2006 ) pertaining to a poten -
tial mechanism for formaldehyde-induced 
leukaemogenesis were summarized as follows: “Based on the data available at this time, it was 
not possible to identify a mechanism for the 
induction of myeloid leukaemia in humans.” The Working Group further stated that “It is 
possible that formaldehyde itself can reach the 
bone marrow following inhalation, although the evidence is inconsistent.” Since that time, Zhang et al . (2009) , reviewed potential pathways by 
which formaldehyde could act as a leukaemogen. Three mechanisms were suggested:
•	by damaging stem cells in the bone mar -
row directly, as most other leukaemogens do;
•	by damaging haematopoietic stem/pro -
genitor cells circulating in the peripheral blood and
•	by damaging the primitive pluri-potent 
stem cells present within the nasal tur -
binates and/or olfactory mucosa.
This subject was reviewed by Heck & Casanova 
(2004) , Pyatt et al. (2008) , and Goldstein (2011) .
(a) Studies in animals
Studies of bone marrow cells in formalde -
hyde-exposed animals have been inconsistent. Kitaeva et al . (1990)  described clastogenic and 
cytogenetic effects in the bone marrow of rats 
inhaling 0.5 mg/m
3 or 1.5 mg/m3 of formalde -
hyde during four hours/day for four months. In contrast, Dallas et al . (1992)  found no evidence 
of cytogenetic abnormalities in the bone marrow 
of rats exposed to 0.5, 3 or 15 ppm [0.62, 3.7 
or 18.45 mg/m
3] formaldehyde for six hours/
day, five days per week, for one or eight weeks. Mice that received up to 25 mg/kg bw formal -
dehyde in two intra-peritoneal injections within 
24 hours showed no increase in chromosomal 
aberrations or micronuclei in the femoral bone 
marrow ( Natarajan et al ., 1983 ). As described in 
section 4.1 above, no increase in formaldehyde-
specific DNA–protein cross-links was observed 
in the bone marrow of Rhesus monkeys or rats under various experimental conditions ( Heck & 
Casanova, 2004 ).
427IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
(b) Considerations of formaldehyde as a 
leukaemogen in relation to other known 
myeloleukaemogens
Known myeloid leukaemogens in humans 
include benzene, ionizing radiation and a variety 
of chemotherapeutic anti-neoplastic agents, all of which give rise to pancytopenia. There is evidence 
that for each of these myeloleukaemogens, pancy -
topenia is caused by genotoxic damage leading to 
destruction of primitive progenitor cells in the 
bone marrow. These cells are responsible for the 
formation of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets, and they are the same progenitor 
cells in which mutations and clonal expansion 
leads to myeloid leukaemia.
In view of the wide variety of genotoxic 
mechanisms shown by the diverse agents that have pancytopenia and myeloleukaemogenesis in common, it could be anticipated that genotoxic 
effects of formaldehyde on myeloid progenitor 
cells would also result in pancytopenia.
Pancytopenia has not been among the haema -
tological findings in experiments with labora -
tory animals exposed to relatively high doses of formaldehyde, including classic long-term safety 
assessment studies. An increase in haemoglobin 
and monocytes and a decrease in lymphocytes were observed in rats receiving 0, 20, 40, or 
80 mg/kg bw formaldehyde by gastric intubation 
on five days/week for four weeks. Lymph-node weights were increased but no change in lymph-
node cellularity was observed ( Vargová et al ., 
1993 ). In one long-term study there was actually a 
statistically significant increase in bone-marrow hyperplasia in rats exposed to formaldehyde at 15 
ppm ( Batelle, 1981 ), the opposite of what would 
be expected for an agent that has effects similar 
to those of other known myeloleukaemogens.
In contrast to the findings in laboratory 
animals, there has been some evidence suggesting a mild pancytopenic effect in humans. A study 
of 50 haemodialysis nurses exposed to formalde -
hyde compared with 71 non-exposed ward nurses from five different hospitals comprised measure -
ments of formaldehyde and two different blood 
counts recorded one a year apart. Both personal 
and ambient measurements of formaldehyde varied widely, from non-detectable up to 2.8 
ppm. Average duration of employment was three 
years for both groups. Symptoms attributable to formaldehyde were reported in the exposed 
group. For the second blood count, but not the 
first, there was a statistically significant inverse correlation ( P < 0.05) between white blood-cell 
count and formaldehyde concentration, as well as between white blood-cell count and symptom score. No statistically significant correlation was 
observed between formaldehyde concentrations 
or symptoms and platelet or red blood-cell counts. The exposed group had a lower white blood-cell 
count than the control group ( Kuo et al ., 1997 ). 
[The Working Group noted that absolute data for 
blood counts were not given, nor was the statis -
tical methodology described]
An increase in B-lymphocytes and changes 
in ratios of lymphocyte subsets were noted in 
formaldehyde-plant workers exposed to an 
average of 0.99 mg/m
3 formaldehyde for a mean 
duration of 8.5 years ( Ye et al., 2005 ). Differences 
in the ratios of lymphocyte subsets were also observed in an Alaskan community with an acute formaldehyde exposure (2–5 ppm for a 
few days), but no differences with the control 
community were seen in total white blood-cell counts or lymphocyte counts ( Madison et al ., 
1991 ). Likewise, no significant differences in 
blood counts were found in a comparative study of students of two schools, in one of which there 
were elevated concentrations of formaldehyde 
and toluene ( Vozenílková et al., 1991 ).
In a review of formaldehyde exposure in the 
People’s Republic of China, Tang et al . (2009)  
mentioned eight studies on formaldehyde-exposed individuals. Lower white blood-cell 
counts were observed in the six studies that 
provided information on this point, four of which were statistically significant; platelet 
428Formaldehyde
counts were decreased in all three studies where 
this was measured, two of which were statisti -
cally significant; and haemoglobin was lower in one of the three studies for which data were reported. The one study that found lower than 
normal values for each blood count – consistent 
with a pancytopenic effect – was specifically the study with the lowest exposure to formalde -
hyde (0.022–0.044 mg/m
3), although the largest 
cohort. [From the Table in the Tang et al. (2009)  
paper, it is not clear whether these are the same individuals or separate individuals who have each of the lower counts, i.e. how many were pancy -
topenic. There also is no information about the usual confounders, including gender and age].
The finding of statistically significant, 
moderately lower blood counts in formalde -
hyde-exposed Chinese workers as compared to a matched control group would be consistent with 
formaldehyde-induced damage to either circu -
lating haematopoietic precursor cells, or with a 
direct effect on such cells within the bone marrow 
(Zhang et al., 2010 ). In this study the 43 exposed 
workers at a formaldehyde-melamine producing 
factory or a factory in which formaldehyde-mela -
mine resins were used to produce utensils, were exposed to a median of 1.28 ppm formaldehyde (10–90%, range 0.63–2.51 ppm; 8-hour time-
weighted average), compared with a median level, 
in a matched control group of 51 individuals, of 0.026 ppm (10–90%, range 0.0085–0.026 ppm). 
Absolute blood counts were only given for total 
white blood-cell counts: in controls, mean (SD) 6269 (1452) cells per µl blood; and in exposed: 
mean 5422 (1529) cells per µl blood, P  = 0.0016. 
Data for the other blood counts are presented 
in a bar chart, and for red blood cells, platelets, 
granulocytes and lymphocytes there are small 
but statistically significant decreases that appear to fall within the clinical range of normal. Also 
of note is a statistically significant increase in 
the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of red blood cells. The MCV tends to be increased in 
myelodysplastic conditions. The study appeared to have adequately taken into account possible 
confounders such as alcoholism and nutritional 
issues that might cause pancytopenia and an 
increased MCV.
(c) Leukaemogenesis on the basis of reactions 
with myeloid stem cells within the nose
As indicated above, Zhang et al . (2009)  have 
suggested that one mechanism of formaldehyde-
induced leukaemogenesis might involve reac -
tion of formaldehyde or a reactive formaldehyde 
derivative with myeloid precursors present 
within the nose. This has been questioned on 
two indirect grounds ( Goldstein, 2011 ). Nasal 
tissue does not seem to have been reported as 
a location for chloromas, which are isolated 
collections of myeloid leukaemia cells, despite the presence of chloromas in virtually all other 
tissues. Second, known nasal carcinogens, 
including cross-linking agents such as nickel and chromium, are not reported to cause an 
increase in acute myelogenous leukaemia. The 
one possible exception is sulfur mustard, a nasal carcinogen for which an increase in leukaemia 
(13 deaths observed; 8.51 expected; not statisti -
cally significant) was reported by Easton et al . 
(1988)  in workers producing sulfur mustard gas 
during World War II. However, this agent also 
produces pancytopenia, an outcome that led to the development of nitrogen mustard as a chemo -
therapeutic compound. None of the other known human nasal carcinogens has been reported to cause pancytopenia.
(d) Formaldehyde and lymphoid cancers
Genotoxicity studies on blood lymphocytes 
from laboratory animals that inhaled formal -
dehyde have tended to be negative, although 
not consistently so. In comparison, somewhat more studies with the lymphocytes of humans 
exposed to formaldehyde have reported geno -
toxicity, although the findings are also incon -
sistent. Genotoxicity in circulating lymphocytes would be consistent with the possibility that 
429IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
formaldehyde is a cause of lymphatic tumours. 
Particularly at risk would be mucosa-associated 
lymphatic tissue in the nasal area.
The evolution of our understanding of 
lymphohaematopoitetic cancers has led to ongoing reclassification of these tumours. There 
is also recognition of their inter-relatedness through a common stem cell, and the fact that 
there is a risk for malignant transformation 
during various stages of the differentiation and maturation process of the precursor cells. Recent 
evidence suggests that an underlying cytoge -
netic abnormality in an early precursor cell 
predisposes to subsequent mutations leading to 
a specific haematological cancer. The possibility 
of a mutagenic effect of formaldehyde on circu -
lating lymphocytes or local lymphatic tissue 
cannot be excluded.
4.5 Synthesis
The current data strongly indicate that geno -
toxicity plays an important role in the carci -
nogenicity of formaldehyde in nasal tissues in 
humans, and that cellular replication in response to formaldehyde-induced cytotoxicity promotes 
the carcinogenic response. Three possible mech -
anisms, all focused around genotoxicity, are 
moderately supported as the underlying mecha -
nism for induction of haematological malig -
nancies in humans. Further research is needed to decide which of the mechanisms is the most 
important.
5. Evaluation
There is sufficient evidence  in humans for the 
carcinogenicity of formaldehyde. Formaldehyde causes cancer of the nasopharynx and leukaemia.
Also, a positive association has been observed 
between exposure to formaldehyde and sinonasal cancer.There is sufficient evidence  in experimental 
animals for the carcinogenicity of formaldehyde.
The Working Group was not in full agree -
ment on the evaluation of formaldehyde causing leukaemias in humans, with a small majority 
viewing the evidence as sufficient of carcino -
genicity and the minority viewing the evidence 
as limited. Particularly relevant to the discus -
sions regarding sufficient evidence was a recent 
study accepted for publication which, for the first 
time, reported aneuploidy in blood of exposed 
workers characteristic of myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes, with supporting 
information suggesting a decrease in the major 
circulating blood-cell types and in circulating haematological precursor cells. The authors and 
Working Group felt that this study needed to be 
replicated.

Vesicants or blistering agents were among the 
first chemicals that were applied as lethal/tactical 
weapons during World War I. Mustard agents, 
also known as sulfur mustard or mustard gas, were the most widely used ( WHO, 1970 ).
Mustard gas was first used during World 
War I during the battle of Flanders, near Ypres, Belgium, in July 1917 (the French name for 
mustard gas is Ypérite). It was then used in 1918 
and again in Ethiopia in 1936. During World War II, mustard gas was the major chemical 
warfare agent; it was produced and stockpiled 
by many countries and is probably still the most distributed chemical warfare agent in the world 
(Szinicz, 2005 ). Mustard gas has more recently 
been used in the Egypt-Yemen conflict (1963–67) 
and in the war between Iraq and the Islamic 
Republic of Iran in 1984 ( ATSDR, 2003 ; WHO, 
2004 ).
On April 29, 1997, the Chemical Weapons 
Convention took effect. This Convention banned 
the development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, and transfer (direct or indirect), of 
chemical weapons. It prohibits the use of chem -
ical weapons, the engagement in any military 
preparations aimed at using chemical weapons SULf UR MUSTARD
Sulfur mustard, also known as mustard gas, was considered by previous IARC Working 
Groups in 1975 and 1987 ( IARC, 1975 , 1987a ). Since that time new data have become avail -
able, which have been incorporated in this Monograph,  and taken into consideration in the 
present evaluation.IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
and the encouragement, induction, or assistance 
with such activities. Each participating/signing 
state is commited to take measures to destroy 
their own chemical weapons and production facilities and to not use riot-control agents 
as a method of warfare. To oversee compli -
ance with the Chemical Weapons Convention, 
the Organization for Prohibition of Chemical 
Weapons was created. It is based in The Hague, 
the Netherlands ( Szinicz, 2005 ).
Sulfur mustard has been used as an antineo -
plastic agent without success, because of its high toxicity. A similar product, nitrogen mustard, has been successfully employed as an anticancer 
agent ( IARC, 1975 ; Saladi et al ., 2005 ). Mustard 
gas/sulfur mustard has provided a useful model 
in biological studies on the mode of action of 
alkylating agents ( IARC, 1975 ). It has also been 
used medicinally to control hyper-proliferation 
of psoriatic keratinocytes ( ATSDR, 2003 ).
1.3 Human exposure
1.3.1  Occupational exposure
Occupational exposure to mustard gas may 
occur in the following activities or industrial 
sectors: storage and destruction of mustard 
gas; construction work on military bases where mustard gas was previously released and remained 
as a contaminant in the soil or in excavated muni -
tions dumps; activities in research laboratories 
where workers do not take the necessary precau -
tions to prevent exposure; during fishing, when lumps of mustard gas are inadvertently caught in areas where it was historically dumped in the sea; 
and during armed conflicts, when it is used as a 
chemical warfare agent ( ATSDR, 2003 ).
Methods currently available for detection 
of exposure to several chemical warfare agents, including mustard gas, have been reviewed (Noort et al ., 2002 ; Riches et al ., 2007 ; Black, 
2008 ). These include analyses of metabolites 
in urine and blood, DNA adducts, and protein adducts.1.3.2  Non-occupational exposure
Non-occupational exposure to mustard gas 
may occur around sites where the agent was 
released during warfare (e.g. Belgium, Morocco, 
Ethiopia, China, Iraq, and the Islamic Republic of Iran), where munitions are buried or where 
contaminated soils containing mustard gas are 
disturbed during excavation activities ( ATSDR, 
2003 ). The average and maximum atmospheric 
concentrations that are likely to have occurred under war conditions in areas where mustard gas-containing grenades or artillery shells were 
dropped, have been estimated at 3 and 5 ppm, 
respectively ( Thorpe, 1974 ).
Environmental exposure may result from 
mustard gas/sulfur mustard vapour being carried over long distances by the wind and from local contamination of water ( WHO, 2004 ). Although 
mustard gas/sulfur mustard is a reactive substance that hydrolyses rapidly upon contact with water, the oily liquid may persist in the environment for 
many years, or even decades. For example, there 
are sites where mustard gas originating from the First and Second World Wars still poses a threat 
to human health and the environment. The envi -
ronmental fate of mustard gas/sulfur mustard 
has been discussed ( Munro et al., 1999 ; Ashmore 
& Nathanail, 2008 ).
In this Monograph  the term mustard gas 
will be used in connection with its military use. 
In other cases, the agent will be termed sulfur 
mustard.
2. Cancer in Humans
The carcinogenic hazards of mustard gas 
were previously evaluated in IARC Monograph  
Volume 9 and in Supplement 7 ( IARC, 1975 , 
1987a ). Mustard gas causes respiratory cancers. 
Human data on the health effects of mustard 
gas are from battlefield exposures and accidents 
(single exposures), and from long-term exposures 
438Sulfur mustard
in chemical factories. Epidemiological studies in 
humans point at a causal association between 
exposure to mustard gas and an excess risk for 
respiratory cancers.
In an early study, the 1930–52 mortality 
records of 1267 war pensioners who had suffered from mustard gas-poisoning during World War I in the years 1917–18 were analysed and compared 
with records of 1421 pensioners who had chronic 
bronchitis but were never exposed to mustard gas, and with those of 1114 pensioners who were 
wounded in the war but not exposed to mustard 
gas (see Table 2.1 available at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100F/100F-25-
Table2.1.pdf ). Mortality from cancer of the lung 
and pleura was increased in the first two groups 
(in both, 29 observed deaths, 14 expected), 
but not in the third (13 deaths observed, 16 
expected). There were no significant differences with respect to cancers at other sites. Almost all 
mustard gas-exposed subjects also had chronic 
bronchitis ( Case & Lea, 1955 ).
In a similar study, mortality records (1919–
55) were examined of 2718 American soldiers exposed to mustard gas during 1917–18, of 1855 soldiers who had pneumonia but were not 
exposed to mustard gas, and of 2578 wounded 
soldiers without mustard gas-poisoning or pneu -
monia. Differences in mortality were seen only 
in the second decade (1930–39) of the follow-up. 
Deaths from all respiratory cancers (observed/expected), calculated from US mortality rates, 
showed a ratio of 39/26 (1.47) for the mustard gas-
exposed soldiers ( Beebe, 1960 ). A further study 
added another ten years of follow-up, but did not 
alter the initial conclusion: the relative risk of 
death from lung cancer among the exposed was 1.3 compared with the controls (95%CI: 0.9–1.9) 
(Norman, 1975 ).
In a Japanese factory producing mustard 
gas in the period 1929–45 – with large-scale production of 450 tonnes/month during 
1937–44 – concentrations at the workplace were 50–70 mg/m
3. The first report of a cancer case in this plant appeared in 1952: a death from bron -
chial cancer of a 30-year old man who had been 
occupationally exposed to mustard gas for 16 
months from 1941 ( Yamada et al., 1953 ). Further 
expansion and follow-up of the plant cohort were 
reported during the following decade ( Yamada 
et al., 1957 ; Yamada, 1963 ). In an extended study 
over the period 1952–67, observed numbers of deaths were compared with those expected on 
the basis of mortality rates in the Japanese popu -
lation ( Wada et al ., 1968 ). Of 495 workers who 
had manufactured mustard gas, 33 had died from cancers of the respiratory tract, compared with 0.9 expected. Of 960 male employees not engaged 
in the production, only three were known to have 
died since 1952 from respiratory tract cancers, compared with 1.8 expected. Although there 
was evidence of preferential reporting of deaths 
in the mustard gas-exposed group, the excess of respiratory tract cancers was substantial. There 
was evidence of a dose–response relationship 
between exposure to mustard gas and subsequent development of respiratory cancer ( Nishimoto 
et al., 1983 , 1988 ; Yamakido et al., 1996 ).
Another study considered workers in 
Germany engaged in production, testing and 
destruction of mustard gas and nitrogen mustard, 
mainly during the period 1935–45. The factory employed 878 workers, of whom 402 had worked 
in close contact with mustard gas, nitrogen 
mustard or with a mixture of the two. In addition, there had been limited exposure in the factory 
to bromoacetone, phosgene, chloropicrine and 
organic arsenicals. Among 271 workers exposed to mustard gas or nitrogen mustard and followed-
up for compensation of occupational disease and 
mortality during 1951–74 there were 85 deaths, 32 of which were due to cancer. Twenty-six were 
lost to follow-up. Compared with Lower-Saxony 
mortality rates, a significant excess was found for bronchial carcinomas (11 deaths observed, five 
expected) ( Weiss & Weiss, 1975 ).
In a follow-up of British workers involved in 
mustard gas-production during World War II, a 
439IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
statistically significant increase in risk for cancer 
of the lung and pleura (RR 1.6, 0.05 <  P < 0.10) 
and of the larynx and trachea (three deaths, RR 7.5, P  <  0.02) were identified among 502 indi -
viduals ( Manning et al., 1981 ).
From a cohort of 2498 men and 1032 women 
who had been involved in the manufacture of mustard gas in Cheshire, United Kingdom, 
during World War II, 3354 workers (95%) were 
traced for mortality until the end of 1984. Between April 1938 and November 1944 the 
factory had produced 24000 tonnes of mustard 
gas (none of this material was in fact used). Gas escaped on several occasions and several 
hundred individuals, mainly in the processing 
plants, had suffered blistering on the arms and acute effects on the eyes and respiratory 
tract caused by small amounts of mustard gas. 
Compared with national death rates for lung cancer, a highly significant excess was observed 
(200 obs., 138.4 exp. P  < 0.001). In addition, large 
and highly significant excesses were reported for 
deaths from cancers of the larynx (11 observed, 
four expected, P  = 0.003), pharynx (15 obs., 2.73 
exp, P < 0.001), and all other buccal cavity and 
upper respiratory sites combined (lip, tongue, salivary gland, mouth, nose) (12 obs., 4.29 exp., 
P = 0.002). The risks for cancers of the lung and 
pharynx were significantly related to duration 
of employment. Significant excess mortality was 
also observed for cancers of the oesophagus (20 obs., 10.72 exp.) and stomach (70 obs., 49.6 exp.), 
but these excesses showed no consistent relation 
with time since first exposure, or with duration of exposure ( Easton et al., 1988 ).
A retrospective mortality follow-up study was 
conducted among 1545 Navy recruits who were stationed in Bainbridge, Maryland, USA. During 
1944–45 they had voluntarily participated in 
mustard gas-chamber tests, to assess the quality of protective clothing and masks. Controls were 
2663 Navy recruits who were stationed at the 
same location at the same time as the exposed, but had not participated in the tests. These groups were followed-up until 31 December 1995. Cause-specific mortality risks associated with mustard 
gas-exposure and the extent or duration of the 
exposure were examined by use of adjusted and unadjusted relative risk estimates. There was no 
excess of any cause-specific mortality associated 
with different levels of mustard gas-exposure among the veterans, although the concentrations 
had been sufficient to cause skin reactions, such 
as erythema and ulceration ( Bullman & Kang, 
2000 ). [The Working Group noted that levels 
of exposure were probably substantially lower than those in studies of production workers and World War I veterans.]
Several studies have consistently shown 
an increased risk for lung cancer among workers in mustard gas-production and among 
World War I veterans who had been exposed 
to mustard gas. Two studies among workers in mustard gas-production showed evidence of an 
exposure–response relationship with duration of 
employment. Two studies, both based on small numbers, reported an excess risk for laryngeal 
cancer. However, neither of these studies adjusted 
for potential confounders, such as tobacco smoking and alcoholic beverage consumption.
3. Cancer in Experimental Animals
Studies with experimental animals exposed 
to sulfur mustard were reviewed in IARC 
Monograph  Volume 9 and in Supplement 7 
(IARC, 1975 , 1987a ). It was concluded that there 
was limited evidence  in experimental animals 
for the carcinogenicity of mustard gas (sulfur mustard). Furthermore, it was noted that some routes of administration, e.g. subcutaneous or 
intravascular injection, may have little relevance 
to common human exposures.
In an inhalation study with male and female 
strain-A mice, an increased incidence in lung tumours [not further specified] was observed in

49% of the animals exposed to sulfur mustard, 
compared with 27% in controls ( Heston, 1953a ). 
Intravenous injection of sulfur mustard also increased the incidence in lung tumours [not further specified] in male and female strain A 
mice ( Heston, 1950 ). When administered by 
subcutaneous injection to mice, sulfur mustard 
induced a few fibrosarcomas and one rhabdomy -
sarcoma at the injection site in males and females, and mammary tumours in females ( Heston, 
1953b ). Oral administration of sulfur mustard 
induced fore-stomach papillomas in male and female rats ( Sasser et al., 1996 ; Table 3.1 ).
4. Other Relevant Data
Since its first use in 1917, there have been 
nearly 400 000 casualties among the victims of 
mustard gas-poisoning ( Rall & Pechura, 1993 ). 
After a lethal dose, death usually occurs within 
2–3 days of exposure and is related to respiratory 
tract injuries, in particular secondary broncho-
pneumonia ( Papirmeister et al., 1991 ).
4.1 Absorption, distribution, 
metabolism, and excretion
4.1.1  Humans
Sulfur mustard can be absorbed after inhala -
tion or through dermal exposure from air and 
soil. It is a lipophilic substance that easily pene -
trates into the skin and mucosal surfaces ( Drasch 
et al., 1987 ; Somani & Babu, 1989 ), resulting in a 
high degree of bio-availability.
About 80% of non-occluded, topically applied 
sulfur mustard evaporates from human skin, while 20% penetrates the skin within ten min 
(Renshaw, 1946 ; Kehe et al., 2000 ). A comparable 
result was found in studies of human foreskin 
grafted onto a-thymic mice ( Papirmeister et al ., 
1984a , b). Of the dose that penetrates the skin, 
60% is bound in the epidermal and dermal tissue, mostly in the cornified layer, while 40% – i.e. 8% 
of the initially applied amount – passes rapidly 
into the blood stream ( Cullumbine, 1946 , 1947 ; 
Nagy et al ., 1946 ; Renshaw, 1946 ). The penetra -
tion rate of sulfur mustard into human skin was estimated to be 1–4 mg/cm
2/min (i.e. 6–25 μmol/
cm2/min), dependent on the temperature ( Nagy 
et al., 1946 ; Renshaw, 1946 ).
Elevated concentrations of thio-diglycol, 
the major hydrolysis product of mustard gas, 
were detected in human urine after exposure 
to mustard gas vapour and aerosol ( Jakubowski 
et al ., 2000 ). Thio-diglycol was also found in the 
urine of people exposed to airborne mustard gas during the war between Iraq and the Islamic 
Republic of Iran ( Wils et al ., 1985 , 1988 ). A 
mustard gas-specific DNA adduct, viz. N 7-(2-
hydroxyethylthioethyl)-2 ′-deoxyguanosine, as 
well as adducts to albumin and haemoglobin have been detected in the blood of two victims of 
mustard gas-poisoning during the war between 
Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran ( Benschop 
et al ., 1997 ; Noort et al ., 1999 ). Autopsy samples 
from an Iranian soldier who died seven days after inhalation and/or dermal exposure to mustard gas indicated the following organ-distribution 
pattern: brain > kidney > liver > spleen > lung 
(Drasch et al., 1987 ).
4.1.2  Experimental animals
Analysis of blood samples from hairless 
guinea-pigs exposed nose-only to 300 mg/m3 (46 
ppm) sulfur mustard during eight min, showed 
that a peak concentration was reached within 
five min after exposure ( Langenberg et al., 1998 ). 
In rabbits and monkeys that had undergone 
tracheal cannulation and were then exposed 
to nominal chamber concentrations of 40, 100, and 500 mg/m
3 sulfur mustard, only 15% of the 
dose was recovered, indicating that 85% was 
absorbed through the nasal mucous membrane 
(Cameron et al ., 1946 ). The absorption of sulfur 
mustard through the cornea was demonstrated 
442Sulfur mustard
in guinea-pigs ( Klain et al ., 1991 ). Thirty min 
after a 5-μL single topical application of radio-
labelled sulfur mustard to the cornea of guinea-
pigs, radioactivity was detected in kidney, liver, lung, adipose tissue, adrenals, blood plasma, and 
muscle.
After six hours of cutaneous exposure with 
occlusion, >  90% of a topically applied dose of sulfur mustard was absorbed into rat skin 
(Hambrook et al ., 1993 ). Within 60 minutes of 
the application, the initial rate of uptake had 
increased linearly with the applied dose in the 
range of 3–605 μg/cm
2 (0.02–3.6 μmol/cm2) 
and reached a maximum of approximately 
7 μg/cm2/min (0.042 μmol/cm2/min) at a dosage 
of 955 μg/cm2 (6 μmol/cm2). The fraction of 
sulfur mustard retained in the skin ranged from 10–50% in different studies ( Renshaw, 1946 ; 
Cullumbine, 1947 ; Hambrook et al., 1992 ), while 
the remainder is absorbed systemically.
Exposure of experimental animals to sulfur 
mustard by intravenous or intra-peritoneal injec -
tion has been reviewed ( ATSDR, 2003 ). These 
studies provide evidence about routes of expo -
sure other than those involving he skin, the lung 
or the eyes. The concentration of radio-labelled 
sulfur mustard in rats four days after intravenous 
injection indicated the following distribution-pattern: kidney > lung > liver > spleen > brain 
(Maisonneuve et al ., 1994 ). The difference with 
the distribution in humans (see above) may be 
due to different measurement methods, inter-
species differences, or variations in post-expo -
sure time, but the route of exposure appears to 
be an important toxicokinetic factor as well.
The reactivity of sulfur mustard with a wide 
variety of cellular macromolecules is well docu -
mented ( IARC, 1975 , 1987b ; ATSDR, 2003 ). The 
presence of two chlorine atoms makes it a strong bi-functional alkylating agent with a high chem -
ical reactivity ( Dacre & Goldman, 1996 ). The 
chlorine atom is typically released under forma -
tion of a carbonium ion, which then undergoes intra-molecular cyclization to create a highly reactive compound. Formation of the carbonium ion is facilitated in aqueous solution ( Somani 
& Babu, 1989 ), which explains the sensitivity 
of mucosal tissues, such as the eye, to its effect (Solberg et al., 1997 ).
The cyclic intermediate mentioned above 
reacts with and alkylates a variety of electron-rich structures in the cell, such as the guanine 
moieties in DNA ( Dacre & Goldman, 1996 ) and 
the sulfhydryl (-SH) and amino (-NH2) groups of 
proteins and nucleic acids ( Solberg et al ., 1997 ). 
Evidence of covalent binding to cellular DNA, RNA and proteins in vivo  was obtained in mice 
injected intra-peritoneally with [
35S]-labelled 
sulfur mustard ( IARC, 1987b ). DNA is the most 
functionally sensitive cellular target of sulfur mustard ( Crathorn & Roberts, 1966 ).
Sulfur mustard-specific DNA adducts have 
been found in the nasal epithelium, naso -
pharynx, larynx, carina, lung, spleen, and bone marrow of guinea-pigs after nose-only expo -
sure ( Langenberg et al ., 1998 ). The evidence of 
sulfur mustard-induced DNA adducts in tissues (Somani & Babu, 1989 ; Fidder et al., 1994 , 1996a ;  
van der Schans et al ., 1994 ; Niu et al ., 1996 ) and 
of sulfur mustard-derived metabolites in urine (Wils et al ., 1985 , 1988 ; Jakubowski et al ., 2000 ) 
suggests the existence of other metabolic path -
ways, which may include direct alkylation reac -
tions, reaction with glutathione, hydrolysis and 
oxidation.
4.2 Genetic and related effects
Exposure to sulfur mustard has long been 
known to produce DNA interstrand cross-links (Roberts et al., 1971a , b; Shahin et al., 2001 ), which 
were first noted in E. coli  (Lawley & Brookes, 1965 ). 
When sulfur mustard reacts with DNA, one of the products comprises two guanines linked by 
a mustard molecule ( Walker, 1971 ). This cross-
link can arise from a pair of guanines in opposite 
strands of the DNA molecule: this interstrand 
cross-link inhibits cell division ( Papirmeister, 
443IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
1993 ). However, the cross-link can also arise in 
significant amounts between two neighbouring 
guanines in the same strand ( Walker, 1971 ). 
Transcription, translation, enzyme catalysis and 
other cellular activities that are dependent on 
biological entities of much lower molecular size 
than chromosomal DNA are much less sensitive to sulfur mustard.
Sulfur mustard induced dose-related inter -
strand cross-links in the DNA of rat epidermal keratinocytes in primary mono-layer culture 
(Lin et al ., 1996a ), affecting cell cycle and DNA 
synthesis ( Lin et al ., 1996b ). Similar results were 
seen in HeLa cells ( Ball & Roberts, 1972 ) and in 
rat cutaneous keratinocytes ( Ribeiro et al., 1991 ). 
Sulfur mustard has also been shown to affect 
DNA mismatch-repair in African green monkey 
kidney cells ( Fan & Bernstein, 1991 ).
Sulfur mustard has been shown to form 
DNA adducts in vitro  (van der Schans et al ., 
1994 ; Niu et al ., 1996 ; ATSDR, 2003 ). Upon 
incubation of double-stranded calf-thymus 
DNA or human blood with [
35S]-labelled sulfur 
mustard, the following adducts were identified: 
N7-[2-[(2-hydroxyethyl)thio]ethyl]-guanine, 
bis[2-(guanin-7-yl)ethyl]sulfide, N3-[2-[(2-
hydroxyethyl)thio]ethyl]-adenine, and O6-[2-
[(2-hydroxyethyl)thio]ethyl]-guanine and its 2′-deoxyguanosine derivative ( Fidder et al ., 
1994 ). The primary site of DNA-alkylation by 
sulfur mustard is the N 7 position of deoxy -
guanosine ( Balali-Mood & Hefazi, 2005 ). 
Upon depurination of the resulting N 7-(2-
hydroxyethyl)-2 ′-deoxyguanosine, the base 
adduct N7-(2-hydroxyethylthioethyl)-guanine 
(N7-HETE-Gua) is released. The toxic effects 
of sulfur mustard have been attributed to DNA adducts such as N 7-hydroxyethylthioethyl-
guanine, 3-hydroxyethylthioethyl adenine, and 
the cross-link, di-(2-guanin-7-yl-ethyl) sulphide 
(Saladi et al., 2006 ). DNA extracted from human 
leukocytes and exposed to [
14C]-labelled sulfur 
mustard in vitro  was shown to contain the 
adduct N7-(2-hydroxyethylthioethyl)guanine (Ludlum et al ., 1994 ). It has been demonstrated 
that alkyltransferase is inefficient in repairing O
6-ethylthioethylguanine, and the persistence 
of this adduct could have serious consequences (Ludlum et al ., 1986 ). Alkylation by sulfur 
mustard also affects transcriptional processes and 
may lead to truncated transcripts by impairing 
RNA polymerase via an alkylated promoter 
(Masta et al ., 1996 ). Analysis of truncated tran -
scripts revealed that sulfur mustard preferentially 
alkylates the DNA-template strand at 5 ′-AA and 
5′-GG sequences. Low doses of sulfur mustard 
can also inhibit cell division by cross-linking of complementary DNA strands, or cause mutagen -
esis by inducing errors in replication or repair 
(Papirmeister, 1993 ; ATSDR, 2003 ). It has been 
noted that cells in late G1-phase (post-mitotic) or early S-phase (DNA synthesis) are particularly sensitive to the effects of alkylation ( Somani & 
Babu, 1989 ).
The ability of sulfur mustard to induce 
mutations has been demonstrated in numerous 
experimental systems ( Fox & Scott, 1980 ). TP53  
mutations – predominantly G→A transitions – 
were detected in tumours of individuals exposed 
to mustard gas ( Hosseini-Khalili et al ., 2009 ). 
Sulfur mustard has been shown to induce muta -
tions in specific DNA regions (r-RNA-coding locus) ( Fahmy & Fahmy, 1971 ; IARC, 1975 ).
Fishermen who were exposed to mustard 
gas from leaking shells picked up during fishing showed an increased incidence of sister chro -
matid exchange in the lymphocytes ( Wulf et al ., 
1985 ). Sulfur mustard induces chromosomal 
aberrations and DNA damage in rodent cells in 
vitro  and mutations in mouse-lymphoma cells in 
vitro  and in vivo  (IARC, 1987b ). In vivo,  sulfur 
mustard has been shown to induce micronuclei in mouse bone-marrow ( Ashby et al., 1991 ). It also 
induced chromosome aberrations in cultured 
rat lymphosarcoma cell lines ( Scott et al ., 1974 ). 
In a host-mediated assay in male BDF1 mice, 
with a murine leukaemia cell line (L
5178Y/Asn) 
as an indicator, sulfur mustard induced both 
444Sulfur mustard
chromosome aberrations and reversed mutations 
to asparagine-186 independence, after single 
subcutaneous doses of 100 mg/kg bw. Similar 
results were obtained with the same cell line tested in vitro  (Capizzi et al ., 1973 ). Dominant 
lethal mutations in adult male rats were induced after exposure to sulfur mustard at 0.1 mg/m
3 for 
52 weeks ( Rozmiarek et al ., 1973 ). Aneuploidy, 
heritable translocations, dominant lethal muta -
tions and sex-linked recessive lethal mutations have been observed in Drosophila  exposed to 
sulfur mustard. The substance is mutagenic to fungi and induces DNA damage in bacteria and yeast ( Kircher & Brendel, 1983 ).
Sulfur mustard appears to preferentially 
damage the cells that are the most actively regen -
erating after injury, such as basal cells located 
above the dermal papillae in the skin ( Papirmeister 
et al ., 1991 ), and epithelial secretory cells in the 
trachea ( Calvet et al., 1996 ). In the cell, DNA and 
proteins are the main targets of alkylation by 
sulfur mustard; it is not unexpected, therefore, that the most severe lesions affect cells with the 
strongest proliferative and metabolic capacity. 
Impairment of the DNA-polymerase function has also been proposed. In particular, impair -
ment of the replicative fidelity of DNA during the S-phase could contribute to mitotic and chro -
mosomal effects ( Bignold, 2006 ). Recently, both 
base-excision repair and nucleotide-excision repair were identified as repair pathways that are activated after exposure of human lymphoblas -
toid cell lines to the sulfur-mustard surrogate 2-chloroethyl-ethylsulphide ( Jowsey et al., 2009 )
Several studies have shown that sulfur 
mustard applied topically on the skin can diffuse and produce biochemical alterations consistent with free-radical-mediated oxidative 
stress, including increased lipid peroxidation 
and antioxidant enzyme activities, depletion of glutathione content in the eye, kidney, brain, 
lungs, and liver of rats and mice ( Arroyo et al ., 
2000 ). Sulfur mustard undergoes nucleophilic 
substitution reactions to form a sulfonium ring (Yang et al., 1992 ) that, in the presence of oxygen, 
first generates a non-toxic, reactive sulfoxide intermediate. Extensive oxidation leads to toxic 
sulfone species ( Arroyo et al., 2000 ).
Besides genotoxic mechanisms respon -
sible for the acute and delayed effects of sulfur mustard, other mechanisms may be responsible for sulfur mustard-induced vesication, since 
acute skin injury develops much earlier than 
would be expected from genotoxic effects alone. Also, tissue injury does not develop when low, 
therapeutically effective doses of sulfur mustard 
are used to control the hyper-proliferation of psoriatic keratinocytes. While the mechanisms 
underlying the toxicity of sulfur mustard are 
currently not fully understood, one hypothesis to explain its cytotoxicity involves poly(ADP-
ribose) polymerase (PARP). It has been proposed 
that sulfur mustard alkylates DNA, which causes DNA strandbreaks whose accumulation can cause 
activation of the nuclear repair-enzyme PARP. 
This causes cellular depletion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, which decreases glycolysis 
and leads to protease release and cellular injury. 
Dermal-epidermal separation and blister forma -
tion may involve the fragmentation of anchoring 
filaments by protease released from moribund 
or dead cells ( Papirmeister, 1993 ). Treatment 
of HeLa cells with sulfur mustard produces a 
rapid stimulation of PARP activity, followed by 
a decline in nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide levels two hours later ( Clark & Smith, 1993 ). The 
hypothesis is almost fully confirmed in a study in which PARP inhibitors prevent the sulfur mustard-induced losses of adenosine triphos -
phate, nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide and viability in human peripheral blood cells ( Meier 
& Kelly, 1993 ). Several other studies provide 
partial support for this hypothesis and suggest that additional pathways may be involved.
Sulfur mustard was found to inhibit anti -
oxidant enzyme activities in blood cells and other tissues of rats, after topical application; the treatment could impair cyto-protective 
445IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
defence mechanisms ( Husain et al ., 1996 ). 
Enzyme activities were measured 24 hours after 
dermal treatment with 98 mg/mg (0.5 LD50) of 
sulfur mustard. Superoxide dismutase activity decreased significantly in white blood cells (70%), 
in platelets (65%), in spleen (72%) and in brain 
(29%) while it was not significantly altered in red blood cells, liver, and kidney. Catalase activity 
decreased significantly in white (54%) and red 
blood (23%) cells and in spleen (51%), while the activity in platelets, liver, kidney, and brain was 
not significantly altered. Glutathione peroxidase 
activity, as a consequence of glutathione and nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide-phosphate 
depletion, decreased significantly in white 
blood cells (42%), spleen (43%), and liver (22%). Glutathione levels in red blood cells, platelets, 
kidney, and brain were within 10% of control 
values.
4.3 Synthesis
Data from a variety of sources all strongly 
support a genotoxic mechanism underlying 
the carcinogenic action of mustard gas/sulfur 
mustard, mainly based on the observation that this chemical is a bi-functional alkylating agent 
(IARC, 1987b ). It was the first chemical reported 
to induce mutations and chromosome rearrange -
ments in Drosophila melanogaster  (Auerbach & 
Robson, 1947 ; ATSDR, 2003 ). The direct reac -
tion of this substance with DNA likely initiates 
a cascade of genetic events that lead to cancer. 
There is evidence to support DNA-alkylation 
leading to cross-link formation, inhibition of DNA synthesis and repair, point mutation, and 
induction of chromosome-type and chromatid-
type aberrations ( ATSDR, 2003 ). Some of these 
changes are observed in nasal tissue, which is 
consistent with the nasal tissue being a target 
organ for this chemical. In addition, produc -
tion of reactive oxygen species and cytotoxicity, 
other reported contributors to the mechanism of action, could act complementary to DNA alkylation.
5. Evaluation
There is sufficient evidence  in humans for 
the carcinogenicity of mustard gas. Mustard gas causes cancer of the lung.
Also, a positive association has been observed 
between mustard gas and cancer of the larynx,
There is limited evidence  in experimental 
animals for the carcinogenicity of sulfur mustard.
There is strong evidence  that the carcino -
genicity of sulfur mustard operates by a geno -
toxic mechanism of action that involves DNA 
alkylation leading to cross-link formation, inhi -
bition of DNA synthesis and repair, point muta -
tions, and induction of chromosome-type and chromatid-type aberrations.
Sulfur mustard is carcinogenic to humans 
(Group 1) .

1.2 Uses
Vinyl chloride is used primarily (> 95%) in the 
manufacture of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which 
comprises about 12% of the total use of plastic 
worldwide ( WHO, 1999 ). The largest use of PVC is in the production of plastic piping. Other important uses are in floor coverings, consumer 
goods, electrical applications and in the trans -
port sector. About 1% of PVC is used to produce 
vinyl chloride/vinyl acetate copolymer. Minor 
uses of vinyl chloride (monomer) include the 
manufacture of chlorinated solvents (primarily 10000 tonnes per year of 1,1,1-trichloroethane) 
and the production of ethylene diamine for the 
manufacture of resins ( WHO, 1999 ; European 
Commission, 2003 ).
Vinyl chloride has been used in the past as 
a refrigerant, as an extraction solvent for heat-sensitive materials, in the production of chlo -
roacetaldehyde, as an aerosol propellant and in drugs and cosmetic products; these uses were banned in the United States of America (USA) 
by the Environmental Protection Agency in 1974 
(IARC, 2008 ).
1.3 Human exposure
1.3.1  Occupational exposure
The main route of occupational exposure 
to vinyl chloride is by inhalation, which occurs 
primarily in vinyl chloride/PVC plants and 
in PVC-processing plants. Only few exposure VINYL CHLORIDE
Vinyl chloride was considered by previous IARC Working Groups in 1974, 1978, 1987 , and 
2007 ( IARC, 1974 , 1979 , 1987 , 2008 ). Since that time new data have become available, which 
have been incorporated in this Monograph,  and taken into consideration in the present 
evaluation.IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
measurements have been reported, but esti -
mates from the chemical industry indicate that 
exposure to vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) 
amounted to several thousands of milligrams per cubic metre in the 1940s and 1950s, and were 
several hundreds of milligrams per cubic metre 
in the 1960s and early 1970s. After its recog -
nition as a human carcinogen ( IARC, 1974 ), 
occupational exposure standards were set at approximately 13–26 mg/m
3 [5–10 ppm] in most 
countries in the 1970s ( Fleig & Thiess, 1974; NTP, 
2005 ; IARC, 2008 ).
CAREX (CARcinogen EXposure) is an inter -
national information system on occupational 
exposure to known and suspected carcinogens 
based on data collected in the European Union (EU) from 1990 to 1993. The CAREX database 
provides selected exposure data and documented 
estimates of the number of exposed workers by country, carcinogen, and industry ( Kauppinen 
et al ., 2000 ). Table  1.1  presents the estimated 
numbers of workers exposed to vinyl chloride in the EU for the top-10 industries ( CAREX, 1999 ).
From the US National Occupational Exposure 
Survey (1981–83) it was estimated that approxi -
mately 81 300 workers (including approximately 
28 400 women) were potentially exposed to vinyl 
chloride ( NIOSH, 1990 ).
A report from the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC) in the USA concluded that the development and acceptance by the PVC-manufacturing industry of a closed-loop 
polymerization process in the late 1970s “almost 
completely eliminated worker exposures” ( CDC, 
1997 ). Even after the late 1970s, however, high 
concentrations may still be encountered and were in fact reported in some countries ( IARC, 
2008 ).
(a) Production of vinyl chloride and its 
derivatives
In vinyl-chloride production, workers may be 
exposed to ethylene dichloride and to catalysts 
such as iron(III)chloride. In PVC production, concurrent exposure to PVC-dust may occur (Casula et al., 1977 ).
Measurements of VCM concentrations 
in indoor air of vinyl chloride/PVC produc -
tion plants have been summarized in IARC 
Monograph  Volume 97 ( IARC, 2008 ). In a study 
on occupational exposure to vinyl chloride that 
was not included in the previous Monograph , 
Zhu et al . (2005)  reported the exposure to VCM 
of workers in a plant in the People’s Republic of China. Concentrations in air of VCM at different 
worksites in the plant ranged from 0.3 to 17.8 
ppm [0.8–48.4 mg/m
3]; the geometric mean 
concentration was 2.6 ppm [7.1 mg/m3].
(b) PVC processing
Measured concentrations of VCM in 
PVC-processing plants were considerably lower than those in plants where vinyl chloride and PVC 
were produced ( IARC, 2008 ). Improvements in 
PVC production in the 1970s resulted in a much 
lower content of residual VCM in PVC resin. 
The lower monomer content led automatically 
to reduced concentrations of vinyl chloride in the workplace air of PVC-processing factories, 
reaching values of < 0.1 ppm [0.26 mg/m
3] (Holm 
et al., 1982 ).
In PVC processing, the polymer may be 
mixed with antioxidants (such as p -nonylphenol), 
stabilizers (such as organic tin compounds), plasticizers (phthalates) and colouring agents 
(pigments) ( Summers, 2006 ) and occupational 
exposure to these compounds, as well as to 
PVC-dust, may occur ( Boraiko & Batt, 2005 ).
(c) Hairdressers and barbers
Infante et al . (2009)  presented two case 
reports of hairdressers and barbers who used 
hairsprays containing vinyl chloride over a period of 4–5 years between 1966 and 1973, and 
developed angiosarcoma of the liver (ASL). The 
ranges of exposure were estimated at 129–1234 ppm (peak concentration), and as 70–1037 ppm 
(average concentration).
452Vinyl chloride
1.3.2  Non-occupational exposure
The general population is potentially 
exposed to vinyl chloride through inhalation 
of contaminated air, ingestion of contaminated 
drinking-water and foods, or dermal contact with consumer products. However, the exposure 
levels for the majority of the population are very 
low ( NTP, 20 05 ).
(a) Ambient air
Vinyl chloride is released into the environ -
ment in emissions and effluents from the plastics industry. Atmospheric concentrations of VCM 
in ambient air are low (usually < 3 μg/m
3) and 
ambient air samples in rural and urban areas of the USA typically do not contain detectable levels 
of vinyl chloride ( NTP, 20 05 ). Vinyl chloride has 
been reported in landfill gas and groundwater, 
as a degradation product of chlorinated solvents 
that were deposited in landfills ( WHO, 1999 ).
Populations living near emission sources (e.g. 
emissions and effluents from the plastics industry) may be exposed to relatively high concentrations of airborne vinyl chloride. Measured concentra -
tions ranged from trace levels to over 2600 μg/m
3, 
and the average daily intake of vinyl chloride 
by residents living near such emission sources ranged from trace amounts up to 2100 μg ( NTP, 
2005 ). A monitoring programme in the 1970s 
around VCM- and PVC-production plants found 
some relatively high concentrations of vinyl chloride in the ambient air. Maximum 24-hour 
average concentrations ranged from 0.32 to 10.6 
ppm [0.8–28 mg/m
3]. Levels of VCM were much 
lower in the vicinity of plants where PVC prod -
ucts were manufactured than near VCM- and PVC-production plants ( Dimmick, 1981 ).
(b) Accidental releases
In June 1996, ten of 18 tank wagons filled 
with vinyl chloride derailed on the Magdeburg-Halle railway line just outside the Schönebeck 
train station in Germany. Vinyl chloride concen -
trations of 0.06–8 ppm [0.16–20.8 mg/m
3] were 
measured in surrounding residential areas. Nearly 300 urine samples were taken from 
rescue workers, residents and a control group, and analysed for the presence of the vinyl-chlo -
ride metabolite thiodiacetic acid. The measured values appeared to be in the range of those of non-exposed people (Thriene et al., 2000 ).

(c) Residues in PVC resin and products
PVC products may contain VCM as a residue 
from production and release it in the air. In a 
German survey (1976–77), the following articles 
released VCM at levels > 0.05 ppm [0.13 mg/m3] 
by off-gassing in the air: bathroom tiles, piping, plastic bottles for table oil, and kitchen wrapping-
film. The highest concentrations were observed to come from vinyl music records, with values 
of 20–50 ppm measured for nine of 14 records 
sampled, but even higher in some of the others. The VCM concentrations released by toys, 
kitchen utensils, food wrappings, wall-paper, 
and car interiors were <  0.05 ppm ( German 
Environmental Office, 1978 ). The introduction of 
improved manufacturing practices has consider -
ably reduced the residual content of VCM in PVC products ( WHO, 1999 ).
(d) Other sources of exposure
VCM is present in mainstream smoke 
of cigarettes (1.3–16 ng/cigarette) and cigars 
(14–27 ng/cigar). The measured concentrations 
correlated with the inorganic chloride content of the tobacco ( Hoffmann et al., 1976 ; IARC, 2004 ).
Exposure to vinyl chloride in drinking-water 
is unlikely for the majority of the general popula -
tion. In a US survey of 945 ground-water supplies 
and 11202 public water supplies that used surface 
waters as their primary source, less than 1% of the samples contained detectable levels of vinyl 
chloride (detection limit, 1 ppb [1 μg/L]). The 
US Environmental Protection Agency estimated that approximately 0.9% of the US population is 
exposed to vinyl chloride in drinking-water at 
concentrations of 1.0 μg/L or higher, and that 0.3% is exposed to concentrations higher than 
5 μg/L ( NTP, 20 05 ).2. Cancer in Humans
Vinyl chloride was evaluated in previous 
IARC Monographs  (IARC, 1979 , 1987 , 2008 ) and 
was classified in Group 1 based on increased risks 
for ASL and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
A report of three cases of ASL in men who 
had been employed in the manufacture of PVC resins provided the first evidence of an associa -
tion between vinyl chloride and cancer in humans 
(Creech & Johnson, 1974 ). The case report was 
particularly informative because of the extreme 
rarity of this tumour in the general population. 
The Working Group in 1974 already considered 
this observation to provide evidence of a causal relationship.
Epidemiological evidence for the carcino -
genicity of vinyl chloride in humans derives principally from two large, multicentre cohort 
studies, one of which was carried out in the 
USA and the other in Europe. These investiga -
tions focused on plants that manufactured vinyl 
chloride monomer, polyvinyl chloride or poly -
vinyl chloride products. In addition to reports 
that pertained to these cohorts in their entirety, 
several studies reported findings from individual 
subcohorts. Results for subcohorts are given in the Tables, but only when they provide impor -
tant information that is not available in analyses of the full cohorts. Results on six cohort studies have also been reported, in addition to and sepa -
rate from the two multicentre investigations.
The first published report of the North-
American multicentre cohort study ( Cooper, 
1981 ) included 10173 workers from 37 plants. 
Among the 37 plants included in the study, 11 plants with 1214 workers produced only VCM, 
18 plants with 6848 workers produced only 
PVC, three plants with 935 workers produced both VCM and PVC and five plants with 1176 
workers produced homopolymers and copoly -
mers. To be eligible for inclusion into the cohort, 
male employees at the 37 participating plants 
454Vinyl chloride
were required to have been exposed to VCM for 
at least one year before 31 December 1972 and to 
have been employed in or after 1942. A second 
major update of this cohort was published by Wong et al . (1991) . A third major follow-up 
included 10 109 subjects and provided an update of the vital status through to 31 December 1995 (Mundt et al., 2000 ).
The European cohort study was conducted 
in four countries (Italy, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom). It included workers from 19 
factories: 11 of these produced VCM/PVC, two 
produced VCM only, five produced PVC only and one was a PVC-processing plant. Male workers 
who had been employed for at least one year in 
1942–1972 in jobs that entailed exposure to VCM were included ( Simonato et al., 1991 ). An update 
of the study ( Ward et al ., 2001 ) analysed inci -
dence and mortality through to the latest year for which data were available in each country, which 
ranged between 1993 and 1997.
2.1 Angiosarcoma of the liver
In both multicentre cohort studies ( Mundt 
et al ., 2000 ; Ward et al ., 2001 ) a substantial 
excess of ASL in exposed workers was found 
(see Table  2.1 available at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100F/100F-26-
Table2.1.pdf ). This tumour is extremely rare 
in the general population and it is not possible 
to calculate an SMR or SIR, because age- and 
calendar time-specific reference rates are not 
available. In the study from the US, 33 of the 80 deaths from cancer of the liver and biliary 
tract were identified from the death certificate 
as due to ASL. A total of 48 deaths due to ASL were identified by combining information from 
death certificates with that from a registry of 
ASL-cases that were related to exposure to VCM. This registry is maintained and updated by the 
Association of Plastics Manufacturers of Europe.
In the European study there were 53 deaths 
from primary liver cancer and 18 incident cases of liver cancer. This total of 71 cases comprised 37 
ASL, 10 HCC, 7 cases of other known histology, 
and 17 cases of an unspecified type of liver cancer. 
[The Working Group noted that the authors searched for the best evidence for diagnosis of 
liver cancers by reviewing all available docu -
mentation, including death certificates, cancer-
registry records, medical records, and listings of 
ASL from two registries.]
In both studies, the risk for ASL increased 
strongly with duration of exposure to vinyl chlo -
ride. In the European study, there was also a 
clear trend of higher risk with increasing cumu -
lative exposure. Multiple cases of ASL were also 
reported in one smaller cohort study (Thériault 
& Allard, 1981 ). Two cases of ASL were reported 
among hairdressers and barbers who had been 
exposed to vinyl chloride for 4–5-year periods in 
the late 1960s and early 1970s, when it was used as a propellant in hairspray ( Infante et al., 2009 ).
2.2 Hepatocellular carcinoma
The assessment of vinyl chloride as a cause 
of HCC is complicated because many studies 
do not have histological or other definitive 
clinical information to discriminate HCC from ASL and/or secondary neoplasms (see Table 2.1 
online). In the US multicentre study, mortality 
from cancers of the liver and biliary tract (ICD9-code, 155–156) was increased (SMR 3.6, 95%CI: 
2.8–4.5; 80 deaths). Of the 80 deaths, 48 were 
identified as ASL. The diagnosis of HCC among the remaining deaths was not verified.
In an internal analysis of the European 
multicentre cohort ( Ward et al ., 2001 ) based 
on 10 verified cases of HCC, the risk increased 
significantly and substantially with duration of 
employment and with cumulative exposure to vinyl chloride. The relative risk for workers with 
the longest duration of employment (> 26 years) 
was 35 (95%CI: 3.3–377) compared with workers with < 10 years of employment. An analysis of a 
single Italian plant with extended follow-up – that 
455IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
was included in the European study – indicated 
12 confirmed cases of HCC ( Pirastu et al., 2003 ). 
The maximal overlap between these two analyses was four cases, since only four HCC from Italy were included in the multicentre cohort. In this 
subcohort, the incidence of HCC again increased 
significantly with cumulative exposure to vinyl chloride. There was suggestive evidence that the 
risk for HCC from vinyl chloride is substantially 
higher among workers who are infected with hepatitis B virus ( Wong et al ., 2003 ), or who 
report high levels of alcoholic beverage consump -
tion ( Mastrangelo et al., 2004 ).
A meta-analysis of cohort studies of vinyl 
choride-exposed workers published up to 2002 (Boffetta et al ., 2003 ) was based on eight inde -
pendent studies, i.e. two multicentric investi -
gations ( Mundt et al ., 2000 ; Ward et al ., 2001 ) 
and six additional, smaller studies (Thériault & Allard, 1981 ; Weber et al., 1981 ; Smulevich et al., 
1988 ; Laplanche et al., 1992 ; Huang, 1996 ; Wong 
et al., 2002 ) (P-value for the test for heterogeneity 
was ≥  0.01). Six of these eight studies reported 
results for liver cancer, but these were  considered 
to be too heterogeneous to be included in a meta-
analysis because for ‘liver cancer overall’ and 
for ‘liver cancer other than ASL’, the P-value for 
heterogeneity was <  0.001. For the two multi -
centre studies ( Mundt et al ., 2000 ; Ward et al ., 
2001 ), the lack of heterogeneity allowed calcula -
tion of summary estimates for liver cancer overall 
(meta-SMR, 2.96; 95%CI: 2.00–4.39; random 
effects model; P-value for heterogeneity = 0.03) 
and for liver cancer other than ASL (meta-SMR, 
1.35; 95%CI: 1.04–4.39; random effects model; 
P-value for heterogeneity = 0.7).
[The Working Group noted that the meta-
analysis did not evaluate the quality of the studies 
and that some heterogeneity between studies 
may have resulted from variable quality of the data. Excluding one study from the People’s 
Republic of China, other studies reported SMRs 
that ranged from 1.78 (95%CI: 1.15–2.62) to 57.1 (95%CI: 24.6–113) for liver cancer overall and from 1.27 (95%CI: 0.84–1.83) to 10.1 (95%CI: 4.37–20.0) for liver cancer other than ASL.]
2.3 Cancer of the lung
Among workers exposed to vinyl chloride, 
there was no overall evidence of an increased 
risk for lung cancer (see Table  2.2 available at 
http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100F/100F-26-Table2.2.pdf ). However, in 
PVC-packers and -baggers, the risk for lung cancer increased significantly with cumulative exposure to vinyl chloride ( Ward et al ., 2001 ). 
[These workers are known to have had concomi -
tant exposure to PVC-dust; the study did not allow attribution of the association to a specific 
agent or combination of agents.]
2.4 Malignant neoplasms of 
connective and soft tissue
Suggestive evidence was found for malignant 
neoplasms of connective and soft tissue (ICD9-
code, 171). This derived from the multicentre 
study in the USA ( Mundt et al ., 2000 ), in which 
a nearly threefold statistically significant overall 
increase in mortality from these neoplasms was 
observed (SMR 2.7, 95%CI: 1.4–4.7; 12 observed, 4.4 expected). The risk was higher for workers with 
longer duration of employment (i.e. 10–19 vs  > 20 
years) and for those first employed before 1960. 
Four of the 12 observed deaths were from angi -
osarcomas for which the site was unknown. The increased mortality from neoplasms of connec -
tive and soft tissue persisted even after exclusion 
of these four angiosarcomas. [This presumes that 
the malignant neoplasms of connective and soft  tissue were mis-classified deaths from angiosar -
coma of the liver.]
The findings mentioned above were not 
supported by results from the European multi -
centre study, in which the number of deaths from connective-tissue neoplasms was too small 
456Vinyl chloride
for an evaluation of exposure–response ( Ward 
et al ., 2001 ): there were six observed deaths 
from neoplasms of connective and soft tissue 
(SMR = 1.9, 95%CI: 0.7–4.1), but in a re-evaluation of the diagnoses three of the six deaths coded as 
tumours of the connective tissue were found to be 
ASL. [The Working Group noted that, although a statistically significant increase in mortality 
from neoplasms of connective and soft tissue 
was found in the US study, the discrepant results with the European study and the difficulties in 
arriving at a correct diagnosis and coding of the 
tumour site for this type of neoplasm, complicate an evaluation of these findings.]
2.5 Other cancers
The Working Group did not find strong 
evidence for associations of exposure to vinyl 
chloride with cancers of the brain or the 
lymphatic and haematopoeitic tissues, with melanoma of the skin (see Table 2.3 available at 
http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/
vol100F/100F-26-Table2.3.pdf , Table 2.4 available 
at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/
vol100F/100F-26-Table2.4.pdf , and Table  2.5 
available at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100F/100F-26-Table2.5.pdf ). 
Although the associations found for these cancers in specific studies may reflect true increases in risk, the findings were inconsistent between 
studies, no clear exposure–response relation -
ships were found in the European multicentre 
study ( Ward et al ., 2001 ), and, for several of the 
sites, the numbers of observed/expected cases were small.
No conclusion could be reached for breast 
cancer since the available studies included too few women.2.6 Synthesis
There is compelling evidence that exposure 
to vinyl chloride is associated with angiosar -
coma of the liver, and strong evidence that it is associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. Together with the observation that vinyl chloride 
increases the risk for liver cirrhosis, which is a 
known risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma, the findings from two large multicentre cohort 
studies provide convincing evidence that vinyl 
chloride causes hepatocellular carcinoma as well as angiosarcoma of the liver. There is contradic -
tory evidence that exposure to vinyl chloride is associated with malignant neoplasms of connec -
tive and soft tissue, and inconsistent or scanty 
evidence that it is associated with cancers of the 
lung, brain, lymphohaematopoietic system, and breast, or with melanoma of the skin.
3. Cancer in Experimental Animals
The carcinogenicity of vinyl chloride has 
been studied intensively and repeatedly in exper -
imental animals, with a wide range of concentra -
tions, spanning orders of magnitude. The many studies consistently showed hepatic and extra -
hepatic angiosarcomas in mice and rats. Various other malignant neoplasms also occurred at several anatomical sites. However, the reporting 
of the results has often been incomplete, and 
the outcomes of many studies are available only from summary tables in the published literature, 
in which technical details are given in footnotes.
Studies of the carcinogenicity of vinyl 
chloride in experimental animals after oral  administration, inhalation, subcutaneous injec -
tion, intraperitoneal injection, and transplacental 
and perinatal exposure have been reviewed in 
previous IARC Monographs  (IARC, 1974 , 1979 , 
1987 , 2008 ). No studies have been published since 
the most recent evaluation ( IARC, 2008 ). The 
457IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
following is a summary of the available data (see 
also Table 3.1 ).
3.1 Inhalation exposure
Vinyl chloride was tested by inhalation expo -
sure in several studies in mice ( Holmberg et al ., 
1976 ; Lee et al ., 1978 ; Hong et al ., 1981 ; Maltoni 
et al ., 1981 ; Drew et al ., 1983 ; Suzuki, 1983 ), in 
several studies in rats ( Lee et al ., 1978 ; Feron 
et al ., 1979 ; Feron & Kroes, 1979 ; Groth et al ., 
1981 ; Kurliandskiĭ et al ., 1981 ; Maltoni et al ., 
1981 ; Drew et al ., 1983 ), and in two studies in 
hamsters ( Maltoni et al., 1981 ; Drew et al., 1983 ). 
Male and female animals of all three species were included, although some experiments 
were carried out only in one sex. Vinyl chloride 
induced hepatic angiosarcomas in three experi -
ments in mice and in eight experiments in rats; 
a dose–response was observed for hepatic angi -
osarcomas in both species over a wide range of 
exposures. Extrahepatic angiosarcomas related 
to treatment with vinyl chloride were observed 
in three studies in mice and one study in rats. Vinyl chloride increased the incidence of malig -
nant mammary tumours in seven experiments in mice, in two experiments in one study in rats, and in one study in hamsters. Exposure to 
vinyl chloride increased the incidence of skin 
epitheliomas in one study in rats and one study in hamsters, and of skin carcinomas in another 
study in hamsters. It increased the incidence of 
Zymbal gland carcinomas in three experiments in rats, with a dose–response pattern in one 
experiment. In mice, vinyl chloride increased the 
incidence of benign lung tumours in six experi -
ments, and of lung carcinomas in two experi -
ments. It also increased the incidence of nasal cavity carcinomas in one study in rats, of hepa -
tocellular carcinomas in two experiments in rats, 
of glandular adenomas in one study in hamsters, 
and of benign fore-stomach tumours in another study in hamsters.In one study in rats, combined oral admin -
istration of ethanol and inhalation exposure to 
vinyl chloride increased the incidence of hepatic 
angiosarcomas compared with exposure to vinyl chloride alone ( Radike et al., 1981 ).
3.2 Oral administration
Vinyl chloride was tested by oral administra -
tion in four experiments in male and female rats 
(Feron et al ., 1981 ; Maltoni et al ., 1981 ; Til et al ., 
1991 ). It induced hepatic angiosarcomas in two 
experiments, lung angiosarcomas in one experi -
ment and hepatocellular adenomas and hepato -
cellular carcinomas in two experiments.
3.3 Subcutaneous and intraperitoneal 
injection
When vinyl chloride was tested in rats by 
subcutaneous injection and by intraperitoneal 
injection in single studies, no increase in tumour 
incidence was observed ( Maltoni et al., 1981 ).
3.4 Transplacental administration and 
perinatal exposure
The transplacental carcinogenicity of vinyl 
chloride was evaluated in one study in the 
offspring of rats exposed by inhalation on 
days 12–18 of pregnancy. A low incidence of tumours was observed in prenatally exposed 
offspring at several sites including the kidney 
 (nephroblastomas) and the Zymbal gland 
(carcinomas). However, no angiosarcomas or 
hepatomas developed in the offspring ( Maltoni 
et al., 1981 ).
Vinyl chloride was tested by perinatal inhala -
tion exposure in two studies in rats. In one study, 
rats were exposed transplacentally, as neonates, and during adulthood. Treatment with vinyl 
chloride induced hepatic angiosarcomas and 
hepatocellular carcinomas. The rats also showed

a high incidence of tumours that were probably 
of olfactory neuroepithelial origin, but were 
formerly reported as cerebral neuroblastomas in 
some studies. Similar results were observed in co-exposed dams ( Maltoni & Cotti, 1988 ). In a 
second study, rats were exposed to vinyl chloride for five weeks, beginning at birth. Angiosarcomas of the liver and hepatomas occurred at a high 
incidence in the offspring, but not in the dams 
that were co-exposed with the offspring ( Maltoni 
et al., 1981 ).
3.5 Carcinogenicity of metabolites
Chloroethylene oxide, a chemically reactive 
metabolite of vinyl chloride, was tested for carci -
nogenicity in a single study in mice by subcuta -
neous injection and in an initiation–promotion protocol by skin application. It caused a massive 
increase of fibrosarcomas at the site of injection 
and increased the incidence of squamous-cell papillomas and carcinomas of the skin at the site 
of application ( Zajdela et al., 1980 ).
4. Other Relevant Data
4.1 Kinetics and metabolism – studies 
in humans
Pulmonary absorption of vinyl chloride in 
humans appears to be rapid and the percentage 
absorbed is independent of the concentra -
tion inhaled. Adult male volunteers exposed 
for six hours to air containing 2.9–23.1 ppm 
[7.5– 60 mg/m3] vinyl chloride, retained on 
average approximately 42% of the inhaled amount ( Krajewski et al ., 1980 ; cited in ATSDR, 
2006 ). Pulmonary uptake is determined in part 
by the blood–air partition constant, which is 1.16 for vinyl chloride ( Gargas et al ., 1989 ). Even if 
no data in humans were available, by assuming 
an identical solubility of vinyl chloride in rodent and human tissues, the tissue–blood partition constants would be twofold greater in humans 
(Clewell et al ., 2001 ), as a consequence of the 
twofold lower blood–air partition coefficient of 
vinyl chloride in humans compared with rats 
and mice.
In the postmitochondrial fractions of liver 
homogenates of humans and rats, large interin -
dividual variations were noted in the metabolism 
of vinyl chloride, while the average activity was comparable between rat and human samples 
(Sabadie et al., 1980 ). Vinyl chloride is primarily 
and rapidly metabolized in the liver (see Fig. 4.1), 
with a saturable mechanism ( Reynolds et al ., 
1975 ; Ivanetich et al ., 1977 ; Barbin & Bartsch, 
1989 ; Lilly et al ., 1998 ; Bolt, 2005 ). The first step 
is oxidation in the liver, predominantly medi -
ated by the human cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme 2E1 ( WHO, 1999 ). Since CYP2E1 is 
present in several tissues at low levels – compared 
with concentrations in the liver – extrahepatic 
metabolism of systemically available vinyl chloride does occur. Inhibitors of CYP, such 
as 3-bromophenyl-4(5)-imidazole or 6-nitro-
1,2,3-benzothiadiazole, reduce the metabolism of vinyl chloride in vivo  (Bolt et al ., 1976 ). The 
primary metabolites of vinyl chloride are the highly reactive chloroethylene oxide, which is formed in a dose-dependent process and has 
a half-life of 1.6  minutes in aqueous solution 
at neutral pH ( Barbin et al ., 1975 ; Dogliotti, 
2006 ), and its  rearrangement product chloro -
acetaldehyde ( Bonse et al ., 1975 ). Both can bind 
to proteins, DNA and RNA and form etheno-adducts; chloroethylene oxide is the most reac -
tive with nucleotides ( Guengerich et al., 1979 ).
Conjugation of chloroethylene oxide and 
chloroacetaldehyde with glutathione (GSH) 
eventually leads to the major urinary metabo -
lites N-acetyl- S-(2-hydroxyethyl)cysteine and 
thiodiglycolic acid ( Plugge & Safe, 1977 ). The 
latter compound has been reported to be the 
major metabolite in the urine of exposed workers (Cheng et al ., 2001 ) with concentrations in

CYP, cytochrome P450; (u), excreted in urineVinyl chloride
urine that correlated with environmental vinyl 
chloride concentrations of >  5 ppm ( ATSDR, 
2006 ). Chloroethylene oxide can also be detoxi -
fied to glycolaldehyde by microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH), while chloroacetaldehyde 
can be converted to chloroacetic acid by alde -
hyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) in the urine 
(Guengerich & Watanabe, 1979 ; ATSDR, 2006 ; 
IARC, 2008 ). Another route of elimination of 
vinyl chloride is exhalation of the unmetabolized compound, which occurs at low levels in humans 
(Müller et al ., 1978 ; Krajewski et al ., 1980 ; Pleil 
& Lindstrom, 1997 ). When volunteers were 
exposed for six hours to air containing 6.8–23.1 ppm [15–60 mg/m
3] vinyl chloride, the mean 
concentration in exhaled air ranged from 0.21 to 1.11 ppm [0.54–2.84 mg/m
3], representing 3.6 
and 4.7%, respectively, of the inhaled amount of vinyl chloride ( Krajewski et al., 1980 ).
4.2 Kinetics and metabolism – studies 
in animals
Experimental studies on vinyl chloride have 
been evaluated in previous IARC Monographs  
(IARC, 1979 , 1987 , 2008 ). Comprehensive data 
on the mechanism of vinyl chloride-induced 
carcinogenicity are available, encompassing 
toxicokinetics, metabolism, biomarkers, and 
genotoxicity. Many key events in the pathway of vinyl chloride-induced hepatocarcinogenesis 
have been established ( Bolt, 2005 ; Dogliotti, 
2006 ; IARC, 2008 ).
The absorption, distribution, metabolism 
and elimination of vinyl chloride in rats and 
mice have been reviewed in IARC Monograph  
Volumes 19 and 97 ( IARC, 1979 , 2008 ) and else -
where ( WHO, 1999 ; ATSDR, 2006 ); the most 
relevant data are summarized below.
In animals, pulmonary and gastrointestinal 
absorption of vinyl chloride occurs readily and rapidly, while dermal absorption is probably not significant. In monkeys exposed (whole body, except the head) to atmospheres containing 7000 and 800 ppm vinyl chloride for, respec -
tively, 2.0 and 2.5  hours, only 0.023–0.031% of the total available amount of vinyl chloride was absorbed via the dermal route ( Hefner et al ., 
1975a ), whereas intestinal absorption and uptake 
in blood was virtually complete in 10 minutes in rats after single oral doses (44–92 mg/kg bw) 
in aqueous solution ( Withey, 1976 ). Pulmonary 
absorption in rats amounted to about 40% of 
inhaled [
14C]-labelled vinyl chloride for initial 
exposure concentrations below 260 mg/m3 [10 0 
ppm] ( Bolt et al., 1976 ).
The tissue–blood partition constants deter -
mine the distribution volume of vinyl chloride, and range from 0.4 (muscle) to 10 (fat) in male 
rats ( Barton et al ., 1995 ). The fat–air partition 
constant for vinyl chloride, reported by several 
authors, tends to be higher in females than in 
males ( WHO, 1999 ). Following inhalation, vinyl 
chloride is distributed in several tissues such as 
brain, liver, spleen, kidney, adipose tissue and 
muscle, with the highest levels found in liver 
and kidney ( Bolt et al ., 1976 ). It has also been 
detected in fetal blood and amniotic fluid of rats 
after a 2.5-hour exposure to ~2000–13000 ppm 
[5200–33800 mg/m
3]), which indicates its capa -
bility to cross the placental barrier ( Ungváry 
et al., 1978 ).
CYP2E1 appears to account for all metabolic 
activity in rat liver microsomes, with a maximum 
velocity (Vmax) of 4674 pmol/mg protein/min 
and a Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) of 7.42 μmol/L ( El Ghissassi et al ., 1998 ). Chloroacetic 
acid was metabolized in rats to two major 
urinary metabolites, viz. S -(carboxymethyl)
cysteine and thiodiacetic acid ( Yllner, 1971 ). 
S-(carboxymethyl)cysteine, S-(2-chloroethyl)
cysteine and N-acetyl- S-vinylcysteine are 
metabolites of vinyl chloride in rats after oral administration ( Watanabe et al ., 1976a ; Green 
& Hathway, 1975 and 1977 ) and N -acetyl- S-(2-
hydroxyethyl)cysteine is a metabolite after inha -
lation ( Watanabe et al ., 1976b ). Thiodiglycolic 
469IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
acid was obtained as a common metabolite in 
rats dosed separately with either chloroacetal -
dehyde, chloroacetic acid or S -(carboxymethyl) 
cysteine. Therefore, the identification of the same S-containing metabolite from vinyl chloride-
treated animals lends support to the hypothesis that chloroethylene oxide or chloroacetalde -
hyde are formed and react with GSH ( Green & 
Hathway, 1977 ). Following oral administration of 
[
14C]-labelled vinyl chloride to rats, [14C]-carbon 
dioxide ( Green & Hathway, 1975 ; Watanabe 
et al ., 1976a ), [14C]-labelled urea and glutamic 
acid were identified as minor metabolites ( Green 
& Hathway, 1975 ).
Saturation of the metabolism of vinyl chloride 
(Gehring et al., 1978 ; Filser & Bolt, 1979 ) appears 
to occur at inhalation concentrations above 200 ppm [520 mg/m
3] in rhesus monkeys ( Buchter 
et al ., 1980 ) and above 250 ppm [650 mg/m3] in 
rats ( Bolt et al ., 1977 ; Filser & Bolt, 1979 ). The 
plateau of incidence of ASL in carcinogenicity bioassays is also observed in rats at exposures above 250 ppm (reviewed in Bolt, 2005 ).
ATSDR (2006)  summarized the kinetic 
constants obtained in vivo  in male Sprague-
Dawley rats (V
max, 58 μmol/h/kg; Km, 1 μM) and 
rhesus monkeys (Vmax, 50 μmol/h/kg) (based on 
Buchter et al., 1980 ; Barton et al., 1995 ). The latter 
value (50 μmol/h/kg) was suggested to be a closer approximation to human metabolism than the value of 110 μmol/h/kg estimated for rats by 
Filser & Bolt (1979) ( ATSDR, 2006 ).
Watanabe et al . (1978a)  reported that the 
elimination rate of vinyl chloride was not altered during repeated exposures via inhalation (five 
days per week during seven weeks) compared with a single inhalation exposure (~13 000 mg/m
3 
[5000 ppm]).
Urinary excretion of polar metabolites of 
vinyl chloride is the predominant route of elimi -
nation at low concentrations, and only very 
small amounts are expired in the air unchanged 
(Hefner et al., 1975b ). Once metabolic saturation 
is attained, vinyl chloride is eliminated via other routes, mainly exhalation of the parent chemical. Following exposure of male rats to 26 mg/m
3 [10 
ppm] [14C]-labelled vinyl chloride by inhalation 
during six hours, urinary [14C] radioactivity and 
expired vinyl chloride (measured as [14C]-labelled 
carbon dioxide) were recovered in amounts of 
68% and 2%, respectively; after exposure to a 
100-fold higher concentration, the proportion of radioactivity in the urine decreased to 56% and 
the amount expired increased to 12% ( Watanabe 
et al., 1976b ). Moreover, the same authors showed 
that after single oral doses of 0.05, 1 or 100 mg/kg bw [
14C]-labelled vinyl chloride, urinary excre -
tion of radioactivity was 68, 59 and 11%, respec -
tively; expired [14C]-labelled carbon dioxide 
accounted for 9, 13 and 3%, respectively; pulmo -
nary elimination of [14C]-labelled vinyl chloride 
represented only 1–3% of the lower dose and 67% of the higher dose ( Watanabe et al ., 1976a ). 
The route of elimination may depend upon the 
route of administration, since urinary excretion 
is favoured after oral or intra-peritoneal admin -
istration, which indicates a first-pass effect due 
to metabolism in the liver ( Clewell et al., 2001 ).
4.3 Reaction with cellular 
macromolecules
Vinyl chloride is a genotoxic carcinogen in 
animals and humans ( Block, 1974; Creech & 
Johnson, 1974 ; Lee & Harry, 1974; Maltoni et al., 
1974 , 1981 ). It is mutagenic, usually in the pres -
ence of metabolic activation, in various assays 
with bacteria, yeast or mammalian cells; it is also 
clastogenic in vivo  and in vitro . Vinyl chloride 
induces unscheduled DNA synthesis, increases 
the frequency of sister chromatid exchange in 
rat and human cells, and increases the frequency of chromosomal aberrations and micronucleus 
formation in mice, rats, and hamsters in vivo  
(IARC, 2008 ).
Osterman-Golkar et al . (1976)  reported the 
alkylation of haemoglobin – at cysteine and 
470Vinyl chloride
histidine – and small amounts of alkylated histi -
dine in proteins from the testis of mice exposed 
to [14C]-labelled vinyl chloride. Binding of non-
volatile metabolites of [14C]-labelled vinyl chlo -
ride to liver macromolecules has been observed, both in vitro  and in rats exposed by inhalation 
(Kappus et al ., 1976 ; Watanabe et al ., 1978a , b; 
Guengerich & Watanabe, 1979 ; Guengerich et al., 
1979 ; Bolt et al ., 1980 ; Guengerich et al ., 1981 ; 
Barton et al ., 1995 ). A decrease in non-protein 
sulfhydryl concentration was seen in rats after exposure to high concentrations of vinyl chlo -
ride ( Jedrychowski et al . (1984) . Kappus et al . 
(1975)  and Laib & Bolt (1977) reported binding 
of vinyl chloride to RNA in an in-vitro incuba -
tion with rat-liver microsomes, and to liver RNA 
of rats exposed in vivo . Watanabe et al . (1978b)  
reported macromolecular binding proportional to the amount of vinyl chloride metabolized, but not proportional to the exposure concentration.
Chloroethylene oxide and chloroacet -
aldehyde can form etheno adducts with nucleic acid bases in vitro  (Guengerich, 
1992 ). Chloroethylene oxide yields the N 7-(2-
oxoethyl)guanine adduct (7-OEG), four etheno adducts – 1, N
6-ethenoadenine (εA), 
3,N4-ethenocytosine (εC), N2,3-ethenoguanine 
(N2,3-εG) and 1, N2-ethenoguanine (1, N2-εG) 
(Ciroussel et al ., 1990 ; Guengerich, 1992 ), and 
5,6,7,9-tetrahydro-7-hydroxy-9-oxoimidazo[1,2-a]purine (HO-ethanoG) ( Müller et al ., 1996 ). 
In rats, the DNA adducts εA and εC have been 
found in various organs after exposure to vinyl 
chloride by inhalation. 7-OEG was the major DNA adduct formed in vivo  and was found in 
greater amounts in young animals ( Swenberg 
et al ., 2000 ). However, 7-OEG has a short half-
life of about 62 hours, while the etheno adducts 
are more persistent. For example, N
2,3-εG (which 
is 10–100-fold more abundant than other etheno adducts in exposed animals) has a half-life of 
about 30 days ( Fedtke et al ., 1990 ). After expo -
sure of rats to 500 ppm [1300 mg/m
3] vinyl chlo -
ride for eight weeks, the εA level was significantly increased above background in liver, lung, lymphocytes and testis, while the amount of εC 
was increased in liver, kidney, lymphocytes and 
spleen, but not in brain ( Guichard et al ., 1996 ; 
Barbin, 1999 ). When adult rats were exposed to 
1100 ppm [2860 mg/m
3] vinyl chloride for one 
or four weeks, there was a significant increase 
in the level of N2,3-εG in hepatocytes and non-
parenchymal cells, but not in the brain, with a linear increase at exposure concentrations 
from 0 to 100 ppm [260 mg/m
3] and a plateau at 
100–1100 ppm [260–2860 mg/m3]. In weanling 
animals there was a small, statistically significant 
increase in N2,3-εG in the brain after five days of 
exposure and the amount of N2,3-εG in hepato -
cytes was significantly greater than that meas -
ured in non-parenchymal cells after exposures 
to 10 and 100 ppm [26 and 260 mg/m3] vinyl 
chloride ( Morinello et al ., 2002a ). These differ -
ential responses between weanlings and adults may contribute to the particular susceptibility of young rats to vinyl chloride-induced neuroblas -
tomas and HCC ( Maltoni & Cotti, 1988 ). There 
was no significant difference in N
2,3-εG-adduct 
levels, nor in the rate of repair between hepato -
cytes and non-parenchymal cells ( Morinello 
et al., 2002b ), which confirms the earlier observa -
tion of Yang et al. (2000) . Data on the occurrence 
and persistence of vinyl chloride-DNA adducts in humans are still lacking. Nair et al . (1995)  
used immunoaffinity purification of the etheno 
adducts and subsequent [
32P]-postlabelling, and 
reported values of 14.1 εA and 8.1 εC per 109 
parent bases in non-neoplastic liver tissue of a vinyl chloride-exposed patient with HCC. These 
adducts may also result from lipid peroxidation (El Ghissassi et al ., 1995 ) and their level can be 
quite high in patients with unknown exposure (up to 0.5–40 εA and εC per 10
9 parent bases in 
liver-DNA samples) ( Bartsch & Nair, 2000a , b).
Barbin et al. (1985)  reported that the 7-OEG–
DNA adduct lacks miscoding or promutagenic properties. In contrast, etheno adducts and 
related exocyclic DNA adducts (e.g. εΑ, εC, 
471IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
N2,3−εG, and HO-ethanoG) may be involved in 
base-pair substitution and other specific muta -
tions in cancer-related genes (i.e. RAS  onco -
genes, TP53  tumour-suppressor gene) ( WHO, 
1999 ). The DNA lesions εA, εC and N 2,3-εG 
have demonstrated miscoding potential in vitro  
and in vivo  (Singer et al., 1987 ; Cheng et al., 1991 ; 
Mroczkowska & Kuśmierek, 1991 ; Singer et al ., 
1991 ; Basu et al ., 1993 ). The adduct εA causes 
A→G transitions and A→T transversions, εC 
causes C→A transversions and C→T transitions 
and εG causes G→A transitions ( Bolt, 2005 ). The 
same mutation types are observed in TP53  and 
RAS  genes in vinyl chloride-induced tumours. 
Mutations in Ki-RAS  are associated with vinyl 
chloride-induced angiosarcomas in humans but not in rats, and to a lesser extent with vinyl 
chloride-induced HCC (CAA61CTA Ha- Ras 
mutation) in rats ( IARC, 2008 ). In half of the 
cases, these mutations led to the incorporation of aspartate instead of glycine. TP53  muta -
tions associated with exposure to vinyl chloride 
(frequently A→T transversions) are found in 
approximately half of the angiosarcomas in both humans and rats. The presence of mutated p21ras 
and p53 proteins in the blood of a high propor -
tion of workers exposed to vinyl chloride and 
the positive correlation between the occurrence 
of the mutated proteins and cumulative exposure 
to vinyl chloride, suggest that the mutation is an early event ( IARC, 2008 ).
Various assays have been designed to explore 
the mutagenic properties of DNA adducts intro -
duced into oligonucleotides or into site-specific 
vectors. Vector plasmids have also been treated 
with 2-chloroethyleneoxide or 2-chloroacetal -
dehyde and propagated in E. coli  or mammalian 
cells. The mechanism by which adducts cause mutations still remains unclear, as misincorpo -
ration events depend on the individual mecha -
nisms of DNA polymerases ( Choi et al ., 2006 ). 
HO-ethanoG and 1, N
2-εG block the replication 
process with many different polymerases, thereby causing base misincorporation ( Langouët et al ., 
1997 , 1998 ; Guengerich et al., 1999 ).
The induction of extrahepatic tumours (e.g. 
in the brain or lung) by vinyl chloride has been established experimentally, but the mechanism 
is not well elucidated ( Bolt, 2005 ). Overall, data 
suggest that etheno adducts are probably involved 
in the initiation of hepatocarcinogenesis, but the 
effects of the observed tissue- and cell-specificity 
and the variability in various biomarkers such as mutant p53 and anti-p53 antibodies are not 
completely clear ( Trivers et al., 1995 ; Brandt-Rauf 
et al ., 1996 ). One source for this variability may 
be explained by differences in polymorphisms in genes (i.e. CYP2E1 , GSTT1 , GSTM1 , ALDH2 ) that 
encode metabolising enzymes or DNA-repair 
proteins (i.e. the XRCC1  gene) ( Li et al., 2003a ).
4.4 Synthesis
Numerous studies on the toxicokinetics, 
metabolism, genotoxicity, and molecular biology 
of vinyl chloride provide strong evidence that the 
carcinogenicity of this chamical involves a geno -
toxic mechanism of action, mediated by reactive 
metabolites. The extensive information on the 
mechanism underlying vinyl chloride-induced carcinogenicity has established many key events 
in the pathway of vinyl chloride-induced liver 
carcinogenesis. These key events include meta -
bolic activation to reactive metabolites, binding 
of the metabolites to DNA, promutagenic action 
of these adducts leading to G→A and A→T transi -
tions, and the effects of such mutations on the 
functioning of proto-oncogenes and tumour-
suppressor genes at the gene and protein levels, with tumourigenesis as the final outcome. Many 
of these key events identified in experimental 
animals have also been demonstrated in humans.

5. Evaluation
There is sufficient evidence  in humans for the 
carcinogenicity of vinyl chloride. Vinyl chloride 
causes angiosarcoma of the liver, and hepatocel -
lular carcinoma.
There is sufficient evidence  in experimental 
animals for the carcinogenicity of vinyl chloride.
There is sufficient evidence  in experimental 
animals for the carcinogenicity of chloroeth -

There is strong evidence that the carcino -
genicity of vinyl chloride operates by a genotoxic mechanism that involves metabolic activation to 
reactive metabolites, binding of the metabolites to DNA, promutagenic action of these adducts 
leading to mutations in proto-oncogenes and 
tumour-suppressor genes. Many of these key events identified in experimental animals have 
also been demonstrated in humans.

4784791. Exposure Data
1.1 Manufacturing processes
Isopropyl alcohol has been called the first 
petrochemical ( IARC, 1992 ). It can be prepared 
via three different methods: indirect hydration 
of propylene, direct hydration of propylene, and catalytic hydrogenation of acetone. Indirect 
hydration, also called the sulfuric-acid process, 
was the only method used to produce isopro -
panol worldwide until the first commercial 
direct-hydration process was introduced in 1951. 
Each method has its advantages and disadvan -
tages. For example, direct hydration is less corro -
sive than indirect hydration mediated by sulfuric acid. However, the direct method requires a pure propylene feed, in contrast to the indirect 
process, which can use a dilute, refinery stream 
(Lee et al., 2003 ).
In the indirect-hydration process, propylene 
is reacted with sulfuric acid to produce mono- and diisopropyl sulfates, which are then hydro -
lysed to isopropanol. In the two-step strong-acid process, separate reactors are used for the propylene-absorption phase and the hydrolysis 
of the sulfate esters. The reaction occurs at high 
sulfuric acid concentration (> 80% wt) and low temperature (e.g. 20–30 °C). The weak-acid 
process is conducted in a single step at lower acid 
concentration (60–80% wt) and higher tempera -
ture (60–65 °C) ( Logsdon & Loke, 2001 ).
1.2 Human exposure
1.2.1  Occupational exposure
CAREX (CARcinogen EXposure) is an inter -
national information system on occupational 
exposure to known and suspected carcinogens, 
based on data collected in the European Union (EU) from 1990 to 1993. The CAREX database 
provides selected exposure data and documented 
estimates of the number of exposed workers by country, carcinogen, and industry ( Kauppinen 
et al ., 2000 ). No results for isopropanol were 
reported. For data on EU workers exposed to strong inorganic acid mists containing sulfuric 
acid, see the Monograph  on Mists from Strong 
Inorganic Acids in this volume.ISOPROPYL ALCOHOL MANU fACTURE BY 
THE STRONG-ACID PROCESS
Isopropyl alcohol and isopropyl alcohol manufacture (strong-acid process) were consid -
ered by previous IARC Working Groups in 1977 and 1987 ( IARC, 1977 , 1987 ). Since that time, 
new data have become available, which have been incorporated in this Monograph,  and 
taken into consideration in the present evaluation. A separate Monograph  on ‘Mists from 
Strong Inorganic Acids’ – updating earlier evaluations on this agent ( IARC, 1992 ) – appears 
elsewhere in this volume. IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
From the National Occupational Exposure 
Survey (1981–83) it was estimated that approxi -
mately 4.7 million workers (including approxi -
mately 2.1 million women) in the United States 
of America (USA) were potentially exposed to 
isopropanol ( NIOSH, 1990 ). No specific informa -
tion on the numbers of workers exposed during 
isopropanol production was provided.
Although no data were available on exposure 
measurements at the workplace during isopro -
panol production, potential exposures from the 
indirect-hydration process include propylene, 
sulfuric acid, isopropanol, diisopropyl and isopropyl hydrogen sulfates, diisopropyl ether, 
propanal, acetone, sulfur oxides, polymeric oils 
and residues. In the past, benzene was used as an azeotroping agent to remove water from ‘wet 
isopropanol’, but nowadays diisopropyl ether 
or cyclohexane are preferentially used for this purpose ( IARC, 1992 ; Papa, 2000 ; Logsdon & 
Loke, 2001 ).
2. Cancer in Humans
In IARC Monographs  Supplement 7 it was 
concluded that there was sufficient evidence  in 
humans for the carcinogenicity of work in the manufacture of isopropyl alcohol by the strong-acid process and inadequate evidence  for the 
carcinogenicity of exposure to isopropyl alcohol and isopropyl oils ( IARC, 1987 ). The carcinogenic 
hazards to humans of work in the manufacture 
of isopropyl alcohol by other methods, and of 
exposure to diisopropyl sulfate were not evalu -
ated. The evaluation was based on an increased 
incidence of cancer of the paranasal sinuses 
observed in workers at factories where isopropyl alcohol was manufactured by the strong-acid 
process. The risk for laryngeal cancer may also 
have been elevated in these workers.
In IARC Monograph  Volume 54 ( IARC, 1992 ) 
an evaluation was made of exposure to mists from strong inorganic acids. The epidemio -
logical data on isopropanol production in that 
Monograph  are updated and reviewed elsewhere 
in the present volume, and partly overlap with 
the information given below.
2.1 Cohort studies 
See also Section 2.1.3 in the Monograph  
on Mists from Strong Inorganic Acids in this 
volume.
Two cases of nasal sinus cancer and two cases 
of laryngeal cancer had occurred among an unspecified number of workers at a Baton Rouge, 
Louisiana, USA, isopropyl alcohol-production plant by about 1950 ( Eckardt, 1974 ; Hueper, 
1966 ). Subsequent analyses considered isopropyl 
alcohol workers in combination with employees in ethanol production and other production units 
(Lynch et al., 1979 ; Hanis et al., 1982 ; see Table 2.1, 
available at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/
Monographs/vol100F/100F-27-Table2.1.pdf ). At 
this plant, a nested case–control study of workers in isopropyl alcohol manufacturing and others ascertained 50 cases of upper respiratory tract 
cancer among employees and former employees 
who had worked during at least 10–15 years. The study made use of an unidentified non-company 
tumour registry (see Table 2.1, on-line). Cases and 
controls were assessed for exposure to sulfuric acid and other agents; those with high exposure 
to sulfuric acid had a significantly elevated odds 
ratio (OR) of 5.2 (95%CI: 1.2–22.1) for pharyn -
geal, nasal sinus, or laryngeal cancer ( Soskolne 
et al., 1984 ).
Six cases of cancer occurred in the 1970s at 
an isopropyl alcohol-production unit in the USA, 
which began operation in 1943 and had employed 
600 workers through 1976 ( Fishbein, 1976 ). 
Mortality through 1978 was studied among 433 
isopropyl alcohol-manufacturing workers in 
this facility (see Table  2.1, on-line): two buccal cavity/pharyngeal cancer deaths were reported 
(Enterline, 1982 ). Subsequent studies of workers 
480Isopropyl alcohol manufacture
at this plant did not include data on the mortality 
experience of isopropyl alcohol-manufacturing 
workers ( Enterline et al., 1990 ; Marsh et al., 1991 ).
Among 182 workers employed 1928–50 in 
another isopropyl alcohol-production unit in the USA, a statistically significant excess of sinus 
cancer occurred (four cases) ( Hueper, 1966 ; Weil 
et al ., 1952 ). Subsequently, a case–control study 
that used reported lymphohaematopoetic cancer deaths as the cases was conducted. Workers ever having had exposure to alkyl sulfates, 
including diisopropyl sulfate, were at elevated 
risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (8 deaths; OR, 5.1; P < 0.05) ( Ott et al ., 1989 ). A later mortality 
study analysed isopropyl alcohol-manufacturing workers together with ethyl alcohol-manufac -
turing workers at the same and another facility 
(n = 1031) ( Teta et al ., 1992 ). Excesses of cancers 
of the larynx, buccal cavity and pharynx were 
observed, but based on very small numbers. 
There was one death due to sinus cancer (see 
Table 2.1, on-line).
Among 262 men employed in an isopropyl 
alcohol-manufacturing unit in the United Kingdom, nine cancer deaths had occurred by 1980, including one from nasal sinus cancer, 
corresponding to a 50-fold increased risk (see 
Table 2.1, on-line; Alderson & Rattan, 1980 )
No further cancer mortality or incidence 
studies specifically updating any of these cohorts in isopropyl alcohol manufacture have been conducted, and no studies of other isopropyl 
alcohol-manufacturing plants have appeared in 
the scientific literature.
2.2 Case–Control Studies
Hu et al . (2002)  conducted a study of 
carcinoma of the kidney (renal cell) in eight 
Canadian provinces. From cases and popu -
lation-based cancer-free controls, data were 
collected on exposures during one year or more 
to 17 substances, including isopropyl oil. The 
OR – adjusted for age, province of residence, education, body-mass index, pack-years of ciga -
rettes smoked, alcohol, and meat consumption 
– was 1.6 for men (95%CI: 1.0–2.6) and 1.2 for 
women (95%CI: 0.4–3.5) (see Table 2.2, available at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/
vol100F/100F-27-Table2.2.pdf ).
Pan et al . (2005)  conducted a similar study 
of cancer of the brain in eight Canadian prov -
inces. Likewise, from cases and population-based cancer-free controls, data were collected on occupational exposures during one year or 
more to 18 substances, including isopropyl oil. 
Exposure to this type of oil was associated with an elevated but not significantly increased risk 
for brain cancer (see Table 2.2, on-line).
Overall, there is evidence from epidemiolog -
ical studies that exposure of humans during the manufacture of isopropyl alcohol by the strong-
acid process causes cancer of the nasal sinuses, based on three cohort studies. The evidence is 
inadequate to draw conclusions on other cancer 
sites. 
3. Cancer in Experimental Animals
No data were available to the Working Group.
4. Other Relevant Data
4.1 Absorption, distribution, 
metabolism, and excretion
4.1.1  Humans
The kinetics of the toxic effects of inhaled acid 
mists on the respiratory tract depend on several 
interrelated factors, which include whether expo -
sure occurs to a gas or an aerosol; the particle 
size, with small particles being more able to 
penetrate deeply into the lung ( Martonen et al ., 
1985 ; Jarabek et al., 1989 ; US EPA, 1989 ); the solu -
bility in water, with agents of higher solubility 
481IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
being more likely to be deposited in the nose and 
mouth; the free hydrogen ion concentration; the 
breathing rate and pattern; the buffering capacity 
of the mucosal layer of the airways and the local deposition site ( Utell et al ., 1989 ); and the pres -
ence of other chemicals carried along with the aerosol particle.
Acid mists that contain particles with a 
 diameter of up to a few micrometers will be 
deposited in both the upper and lower airways. It is difficult to identify the principal site of depo -
sition within the respiratory tract. For example, 90% of an aerosol of sulfuric acid (mass median aerodynamic diameter of particles, 5 μm) to 
which lead-acid battery workers are exposed, 
would be deposited in the extra-thoracic region of the respiratory tract, whereas only 50% of an 
aerosol with 2-μm particle size would be depos -
ited in that same portion of the respiratory tract. 
This relationship between size and deposition 
renders estimation of the changes in pH of the 
mucus problematic, as diffuse deposition chal -
lenges the buffering capacity much less than does 
deposition of large particles at local sites ( Gamble 
et al., 1984 ; Jarabek et al., 1989 ).
Assuming an average particle size of 1 μm and 
exposure concentrations of 0.4–1 mg/m
3, Amdur 
et al . (1952)  showed that on average 77% of an 
inhaled aerosol of sulfuric acid was retained in the 
airways of exposed human subjects. Martonen et al . (1985)  demonstrated that the hygroscopic 
growth of particles (≤ 1 μm) of several inorganic acids within the respiratory tract depended on temperature, humidity, particle size, respiratory 
characteristics and the hygroscopic nature of the 
acid.
The breathing pattern (i.e. mouth vs  nose 
breathing, with normal augmentation through the mouth) also influences deposition. For all particle sizes, the dose deposited regionally 
below the nasopharynx is higher for mouth 
breathers. The effect of mouth breathing is most evident from the increasing deposition in the oropharynx, larynx and upper trachea ( Jarabek 
et al., 1989 ).
In the moist environment of the respiratory 
tract, sulfur trioxide – the anhydride of sulfuric acid – reacts instantaneously with water to form 
sulfuric acid ( IARC, 1992 ); therefore, the toxi -
cology of sulfur trioxide would be expected to be 
the same as that of sulfuric acid.
The medical condition called Barrett’s 
oesophagus provides supporting evidence for an association between exposure to an acidic envi -
ronment and cancer. Barrett’s oesophagus refers to a metaplastic change of the lining of the lower end of the oesophagus, which is thought to be 
caused by chronic exposure to acid from gastric 
reflux. Genetic polymorphisms associated with an inflammatory response, DNA repair and 
chemical detoxication are all associated with 
the presence or progression of the condition. Changes in gene expression have been seen in 
metaplastic cells as a result of chronic inflam -
mation, which could be due to genetic changes, 
epigenetic changes or modifications to signalling 
pathways ( Shaheen & Richter, 2009 ).
4.1.2  Experimental systems
Generally, with respect to acid aerosol depo -
sition similar effects were observed in animals. Regional deposition of sulfuric acid aerosols 
in experimental animals is also dependent on particle size (e.g. Dahl et al ., 1983 ). However, 
animal species differ from humans with regard to the dimensions and architecture of the respi -
ratory tract, and deposition patterns of aerosols 
may vary accordingly ( Jarabek et al ., 1989 ). A 
study in anaesthetized dogs showed that produc -
tion of ammonia by the respiratory tract partially neutralizes acid aerosols, but larger-size aerosols 
are neutralized less efficiently than smaller-size aerosols ( Larson et al., 1982 ).
482Isopropyl alcohol manufacture
4.2 Genetic and related effects
4.2.1  Humans
Significant increases in the incidence of 
sister chromatid exchange (SCE), micronucleus 
formation and chromosomal aberrations in 
peripheral lymphocytes were detected in a study of 40 workers at a sulfuric acid plant in China, 
compared with 42 controls working and studying 
at a university in the same city as the factory. The controls were matched according to sex, age and 
smoking habits. The mean number of SCE/cell 
was 6.72 ± 0.22 for workers and 2.71 ± 0.31 for unexposed controls ( P  <  0.01); the mean frequency 
of micronuclei in cultivated lymphocytes was 0.168% in those from the workers and 0.071% from the control group ( P  <  0.001); and the 
mean frequency of several types of chromosomal aberration (including rings, translocations and di-centrics) per 100 metaphases was 0.963 for 
the workers and 0.227 for controls ( P < 0.01). No 
positive correlation was observed between the 
frequency of sister chromatid exchange, micro -
nuclei or chromosomal aberrations and length of employment of the workers. While there was no significant difference between smokers and non-
smokers with regard to the frequencies of sister 
chromatid exchange and chromosomal aberra -
tions, smokers among both the workers and the 
controls had significantly more micronuclei than 
non-smokers ( P < 0.001) ( Meng & Zhang 1990a , 
b).
4.2.2  Experimental systems
No data were available on genetic and related 
effects of exposures to acid mists in experimental 
systems; however, studies on genotoxic effects 
under extreme culture conditions with respect to pH have been reviewed ( Scott et al ., 1991 ; 
Swenberg & Beauchamp, 1997 ).
The carcinogenic activity of sulfuric acid 
may be related to the genotoxicity of low pH 
conditions. Reduced pH environments enhance the depurination rate of DNA and the deami -
nation rate of cytidine ( Singer & Grunberger, 
1983 ; IARC, 1992 ); it has been suggested that the 
fidelity of enzymes involved in DNA replication 
and repair may be reduced by low pH ( Brusick, 
1986 ). Also, low pH (5.4–6.5) is associated with 
induction of clastogenicity, sister chromatid exchange and chromosomal aberrations ( Morita 
et al., 1991 , 1992 ; Morita, 1995 ).
Deamination of cytidine at CpG sites appears 
to be one of the mechanisms of mutation induc -
tion in the p53  tumour-suppressor gene (Harris, 
1993 ).
4.3 Toxicity relevant to 
carcinogenicity
Acid mists are irritating to mucous epithelia; 
they cause dental erosion and produce acute 
effects in the lungs (symptoms and changes in 
pulmonary function) ( IARC, 1992 ).
Workers exposed to sulfuric acid mists had 
an increased incidence of symptoms and macro -
scopic and microscopic changes of the nasal mucosa, including squamous metaplasia and 
atypia, with an exposure-response relationship 
(Grasel et al., 2003 ).
4.4 Synthesis
Little information on possible mechanisms 
of carcinogenicity of inorganic acid mists is 
available. The increased incidence of cancer of 
the paranasal sinuses in workers involved in the strong-acid process of isopropyl alcohol manu -
facture may be due to exposure to the strong acid mists and/or the presence of diisopropyl sulfate, an intermediate that shows sufficient evidence of 
carcinogenicity in experimental animals.
Available data suggest that localized low pH 
from inhalation of inorganic acid mists could damage DNA and lead to neoplasia. There is 
no evidence that would support the occurrence of DNA damage by any other mechanism of 
carcinogenesis.
483IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
5. Evaluation
There is sufficient evidence  in humans for the 
carcinogenicity of isopropyl alcohol manufac -
ture by the strong-acid process. Isopropyl alcohol 
manufacture by the strong-acid process causes cancer of the nasal cavity. 
No data on carcinogenicity of strong acid 
mists in experimental animals were available to the Working Group.
It is plausible that areas of localized low pH 
from inhalation of inorganic acid mists could damage DNA and increase cancer risks. There 
is no evidence to support DNA-damage induc -
tion by any other mechanism as the cause of the 
observed cancers due to exposure to inorganic 
acid mists.
Isopropyl alcohol manufacture by the strong-
acid process is carcinogenic to humans (Group 1).

4854871. Exposure Data
1.1 Manufacturing processes
Major industries with exposure to strong 
inorganic acid mists include those that manufac -
ture phosphate fertilizer, isopropanol (isopropyl 
alcohol), synthetic ethanol (ethyl alcohol), sulfuric acid, nitric acid, and lead batteries. 
Exposure also occurs during copper smelting, 
and pickling and other acid treatment of metals (Suresh, 2009 ).
Minor uses of sulfuric acid include applica -
tions in petroleum refining, mining, metallurgy, and ore processing, in the synthesis of inorganic 
and organic chemicals, synthetic rubber and 
plastics, in the processing of pulp and paper, the manufacture of soap and detergents, cellulose 
fibres and films, inorganic pigments and paints, 
and in water treatment. The use of sulfuric acid is declining in some industries. For example, there 
is a trend in the steel industry to use hydrochloric 
acid instead of sulfuric acid in the metallurgic process of pickling, and hydrofluoric acid has 
replaced sulfuric acid for some applications in 
the petroleum industry ( IARC, 1992 ; ATSDR, 
1998 ; NTP, 20 05 ).1.2 Human exposure
1.2.1  Occupational exposure
Strong inorganic acid mists may be produced 
as a result of the use of inorganic acids, including 
sulfuric acid, in various industrial processes, as 
indicated in the previous section ( IARC, 1992 ). 
The amount of vapour or mist that is produced 
varies with the process and the method. In pick -
ling, for instance, mist may escape from tanks 
filled with acid, when hydrogen gas and steam 
rise from the surface of the solution ( NTP, 20 05 ).
CAREX (CARcinogen EXposure) is an inter -
national information system on occupational exposure to known and suspected carcino -
gens, based on data collected in the European 
Union from 1990 to 1993. The CAREX database 
provides selected exposure data and documented 
estimates of the number of exposed workers by country, carcinogen, and industry ( Kauppinen 
et al., 2000 ). Table 1.1  shows the results for strong 
inorganic acid mists containing sulfuric acid in the European Union by industry ( CAREX, 1999 ).
From the National Occupational Exposure 
Survey (1981–83) it was estimated that MISTS f ROM STRONG INORGANIC ACIDS
Occupational exposures to mists and vapours from sulfuric acid and other strong inorganic 
acids were considered by an IARC Working Group in 1991 ( IARC, 1992 ). Since that time new 
data have become available, which have been incorporated in this Monograph , and taken 
into consideration in the present evaluation. A separate Monograph  on ‘Isopropyl Alcohol 
Manufacture by the Strong-acid Process’ – updating earlier evaluations on this agent ( IARC, 
1977 , 1987 ) – appears elsewhere in this volume.IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
approximately 776000 workers (including 
approximately 174000 women) in the United 
States of America (USA) were potentially exposed 
to sulfuric acid ( NIOSH, 1990 ). [The Working 
Group noted that these numbers do not specifi -
cally reflect exposures to strong inorganic acid mists.]
Exposure to strong inorganic acid mists 
containing sulfuric acid may occur by inhala -
tion, ingestion, and dermal contact. Exposure depends on many factors including particle 
size, proximity to the source, and control meas -
ures such as ventilation and containment. Data 
on particle-size distribution of acid mists are 
limited, and sampling methods have generally 
not differentiated between liquid and gaseous forms of the acids ( IARC, 1992 ; NTP, 20 05 ).
Sulfuric acid is used with other strong inor -
ganic acids in many manufacturing processes, during which strong inorganic acid mists may 
be generated. Data from studies on exposure to 
inorganic acid mists published since the previous IARC Monograph  (IARC, 1992 ) are briefly 
summarized below.
Sathiakumar et al. (1997)  reviewed and cate -
gorized 25 epidemiological studies on the basis of 
high (> 1 mg/m
3; 8-hour time-weighted average ), 
moderate (0.1–1 mg/m3) and low (< 0.1 mg/m3) exposure to sulfuric acid mists. Workers in the 
production of sulfuric acid and isopropanol, 
and in metal pickling were considered to have 
potentially high exposure, while workers in the production of soap and detergent, nitric acid, 
and ethanol were assumed to have moderate 
exposure. The lowest estimated exposures were for workers in copper and zinc refining and in 
the production of phosphate fertilizers and lead 
batteries. This grouping generally applies to exposures that occurred before 1970. In the early 
1970s, the exposure started to decline due to 
the use of lower concentrations of the acids and improved industrial control measures.
Aerosol sampling was conducted at 24 loca -
tions in eight plants that manufactured phos -
phoric acid and concentrated fertilizer in Florida 
(USA) and in two locations as control sites else -
where in Florida. In general, sulfate, fluoride, 
ammonium, and phosphate were the major 
chemical species found in the fertilizer plants. 
At the sulfuric acid tank, sulfate was the domi -
nant substance, with a maximum PM
10 sulfate 
concentration of 181 μg/m3. The concentrations 
of sulfate-containing PM10, including ammo -
nium sulfate, calcium sulfate, and sulfuric acid 
were lower than 200 μg/m3 at all locations ( Hsu 
et al., 2007a , b, 2008 ).

From CAREX (1999) , see also Kauppinen et al . (2000)Strong inorganic acid mists
In a multidisciplinary cross-sectional study of 
22 galvanic plants in Sao Paulo, Brazil from 1993 
to 1996, ambient air was collected and personal 
exposure measurements were conducted on five consecutive working days. The geometric 
means for the concentration of sulphuric acid in 
ambient-air samples from five anodising plants varied from 34.7 to 2133.6 μg/m3 (total range, 
7.2–2780.0 μg/m3); for personal samples, the 
geometric means ranged from 12.7 to 396.5 μg/m3 (total range, 5.3–865.6 μg/m3) ( Grasel et al ., 
2003 ).
Steenland (1997)  described a follow-up study 
of a cohort of 1156 acid-exposed steelworkers 
employed in the USA between 1940 and 1965. The 
workers were followed until the end of October 1994. Historically, sulfuric acid was the most 
common acid used for pickling, but in the mid-
1960s it was gradually replaced by hydrochloric, nitric, hydrofluoric, and hydrocyanic acid, with 
hydrochloric acid being the most common. For 
two of the three plants, personal exposure levels for sulfuric acid in air averaged 0.19 mg/m
3 in the 
period 1975–79 (time-weighted average, based on 
15 samples) and the average concentration in the 
work area was 0.29 mg/m3 (based on 34 samples). 
Exposures in the third plant were estimated to 
have been similar.
Exposure to mineral acid mists was assessed 
at two battery manufacturers (factories A and B, established in 1914 and 1929, respectively) and 
two steel works (factories C and D, established in 1948 and 1945, respectively) in the United 
Kingdom. In both factories exposure to sulfuric 
acid occurred principally during the forma -
tion and charging processes. Other exposures 
included those to asbestos – crocidolite and 
chrysotile –, lead, stibine, and pitch. Fixed-site monitoring of sulfuric acid was conducted from 
1970 onwards and showed concentrations in air 
of 0.1–0.7 mg/m
3 in factory A, and 0.4–2.0 mg/m3 
in factory B. In the steel works C and D, sulfuric 
acid was used to clean steel before plating and 
galvanizing. Although its use was phased out in favour of hydrochloric acid in both factories, sulphuric acid continued to be used in the hot 
sheet finishing and plating areas in factory C, and 
in galvanizing processes in factory D. No occu -
pational hygiene measurements of acid mists 
were available for either steel factory ( Coggon 
et al., 1996 ).
2. Cancer in Humans
Occupational exposures to mists from strong 
inorganic acids (e.g. sulfuric, hydrochloric, nitric and phosphoric acids) were last evaluated by a 
previous IARC Monograph  (IARC, 1992 ), which 
concluded that there is sufficient evidence  for the 
carcinogenicity to humans of occupational expo -
sure to strong-inorganic-acid mists containing sulfuric acid.
2.1 Cohort studies
Industries with exposure to strong inorganic 
acids have been categorized with respect to 
potential average exposure levels to sulfuric acid 
mists: highest — metal pickling, sulfuric acid production, isopropanol production; moderate 
— soap and detergent production, nitric acid, 
and ethanol production; and low — copper and zinc refining, phosphate fertilizer production, 
and lead battery production ( Sathiakumar et al., 
1997 ).
2.1.1  Metal pickling
Sulfuric acid and other inorganic acids have 
been used to pickle steel (i.e. remove scale and oxides from the metal surface) as part of the 
finishing process in the steel industry. Cohorts in Sweden, the USA and France have been studied 
(Mazumdar et al ., 1975 ; Ahlborg et al ., 1981 ; 
Beaumont et al ., 1987 ; Steenland et al ., 1988 ; 
Steenland & Beaumont, 1989 ; Steenland, 1997 ; 
Moulin et al ., 2000 ; see Table  2.1, available at 
http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/
vol100F/100F-28-Table2.1.pdf ). Studies on cancer 
of the larynx showed statistically significant 
489IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
excess risks in Sweden ( Ahlborg et al ., 1981 ) 
and the USA ( Steenland, 1997 ), while in a study 
from France non-significant excesses were found 
(Moulin et al., 2000 ). In the US cohort, Steenland 
& Beaumont (1989) found a significant excess 
risk for cancer of the lung, considering a latency 
period of 20 years.
2.1.2  Sulfuric and nitric acid manufacture
Englander et al . (1988)  reported a non-
significant twofold excess of respiratory cancers 
and increases in bladder-cancer mortality in a 
Swedish sulfuric acid factory. Excesses of myeloid leukaemia were noted in an Italian sulfuric acid 
factory ( Pesatori et al ., 2006 ), and increased 
risks for lung and pleural cancer were found in 
a Norwegian nitric acid plant (SIR = 4.5; 95%CI: 
2.6–7.2) ( Hilt et al., 1985 ). An elevated lung-cancer 
mortality was observed among men working 
with acid mixtures in an Italian factory, but the 
increase was not statistically significant ( Rapiti 
et al., 1997 ). Likewise, at two US tanneries where 
sulfuric acid was used in the de-liming, bating and pickling subdepartments of the beamhouse, 
an elevated lung-cancer mortality was found, but the increase was not significant ( Stern, 2003 ; see 
Table 2.1, on-line).
2.1.3  Manufacture of isopropanol and 
ethanol
See also the Monograph  on Isopropyl Alcohol 
Manufacture by the Strong-acid Process in this 
volume.
In addition to acid mists, workers in isopro -
panol and ethanol production may be exposed to alloy/sulfates and isopropanol oils. Cohort 
studies in one factory in the United Kingdom 
and four in the USA where isopropyl alcohol and 
ethyl alcohol were manufactured by the strong-acid process showed a significant excess of cancers 
in the upper respiratory tract – nasal sinus, 
pharynx, larynx – and buccal cavity. Hueper (1966)  found significant excesses of nasal sinus and larynx cancers combined (SIR 21.9, 95%CI: 7.9–56.1) based on two cases each. In the same 
facility, Lynch et al . (1979)  reported significant 
excesses for cancer of the larynx. Subsequently, a 
nested case–control study among workers in the 
same plant assessed 50 upper respiratory tract 
cancer cases and controls with regards to expo -
sure to sulfuric acid and other agents. Those with 
“high” sulfuric acid exposure had an increased 
risk (OR, 5.2; 95%CI: 1.2–22.1) for pharyngeal, sinus, or laryngeal cancer ( Soskolne et al ., 1984 ; 
see Table 2.1, on-line).
Excess risks for buccal cavity and pharynx 
cancer were identified in an isopropyl alcohol 
production unit in the USA, which began opera -
tion in 1941 and had employed 433 workers 
through 1965 ( Enterline, 1982 ).
Weil et al. (1952)  reported a highly significant 
risk for nasal sinus cancer, based on four cases, in an isopropyl alcohol production facility in the 
USA. A case–control study of lympho-haemato -
poietic malignancies at the same plant showed 
an elevated risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma 
among workers ever exposed to alkyl sulfates, 
including those in the isopropyl and ethyl alcohol production units, where sulfuric acid was used 
(Ott et al., 1989 ). In a subsequent mortality study 
conducted in this facility, workers in isopropanol 
and ethanol production had a statistically signifi -
cantly increased mortality risk for lympho- and reticulosarcoma ( Teta et al ., 1992 ; see Table 2.1, 
on-line). Mortality from upper respiratory and 
lympho-haematopoietic cancers was also inves -
tigated in another isopropanol- and ethanol-
manufacturing facility in the USA, but significant 
cancer excesses were not observed in this case 
(Teta et al., 1992 ). In an isopropyl alcohol-manu -
facturing unit in the United Kingdom, nine 
cancer deaths had occurred by 1980, including 
one from nasal sinus cancer; this was statistically significant ( Alderson & Rattan, 1980 ).
490Strong inorganic acid mists
2.1.4  Soap manufacture
The only study of soap-manufacturing 
workers exposed to sulfuric acid vapours in 
the hydrolysis and saponification areas, found 
increased risks – not statistically significant – for laryngeal cancer incidence and mortality 
through 1983 ( Forastiere et al., 1987 ).
2.1.5 Manufacture of phosphate and nitrate 
fertilizer
Sulfuric acid is used to convert phosphate 
rock to phosphoric acid and superphosphate; 
nitric acid is the precursor of nitrate fertilizers. 
Many fertilizer plants manufacture these two acids on site ( Al-Dabbagh et al ., 1986 ; Rafnsson 
& Gunnarsdóttir, 1990 ; Hagmar et al ., 1991 ; 
Fandrem et al ., 1993 ; Checkoway et al ., 1996 ). 
Several research groups studied phosphate-ferti -
lizer manufacturing in the USA ( Stayner et al ., 
1985 ; Block et al., 1988 ; Checkoway et al., 1996 ). All 
found elevated lung cancer mortality, with higher 
rates for those who had been employed longer. 
Nitrate-fertilizer manufacture has been studied in Iceland, Norway, the Russian Federation, 
Sweden, and the United Kingdom ( Al-Dabbagh 
et al ., 1986 ; Rafnsson & Gunnarsdóttir, 1990 ; 
Hagmar et al ., 1991 ; Fandrem et al ., 1993 ; 
Zandjani et al ., 1994 ; Bulbulyan et al ., 1996 ). 
None of these studies found statistically signifi -
cantly elevated risks among workers potentially exposed to nitric acid mists except the study from 
Sweden ( Zandjani et al ., 1994 ), which showed a 
standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for stomach 
cancer of 1.50 ( P < 0.05) for 27 men hired before 
1960, and an SIR for testicular cancer of 3.33 
(P < 0.05) for 5 men hired during or after 1960. 
In a factory complex where both phosphate and nitrate fertilizers were manufactured, Bulbulyan et al . (1996)  reported a statistically significant 
increase in stomach-cancer mortality for men in the sulfuric acid tower department (11 deaths, SMR 2.04, 95%CI: 1.02–3.66) (see Table  2.1, 
on-line). 2.1.6  Battery manufacture
Mortality for all cancers combined and for 
various separate respiratory cancers has been reported from four cohort studies of battery-
manufacturing workers (one including cohorts from steel works as well) in the United Kingdom 
and the USA ( Malcolm & Barnett, 1982 ; Cooper 
et. al., 1985 ; Coggon et al., 1996 ; Sorahan & Esmen, 
2004 ; see Table  2.1, on-line). In two studies, 
excesses of laryngeal cancer were found ( Cooper 
et al., 1985 ; Sorahan & Esmen, 2004 ). Within the 
United Kingdom cohort, a nested case–control analysis was carried out in two battery-manufac -
turing plants and two steel works, with respect 
to exposure to acid mists. The study included 15 
cases with upper aerodigestive cancers (ICD-9 
140–141, 143–149, 160–161) and 75 controls. The odds of cancer among those with high exposure 
to acids, or among those with five or more years 
of high exposure were increased compared with those with no exposure to acids, but this was not 
statistically significant ( Coggon et al., 1996 ).
2.1.7  Other industries
Two nested case–control studies, one in the 
Norwegian nickel-refining industry ( Grimsrud 
et al ., 2005 ) and one in the chemical industry in 
the USA ( Bond et al., 1986 ; 1991 ) were reviewed. In 
the first study, a job-exposure matrix for sulfuric acid mist was developed, the second study devel -
oped a job-exposure matrix for hydrochloric 
acid; neither found an association between acid 
mist exposure and lung cancer.
2.2 Case–control studies
Case–control studies of cancer of the upper 
respiratory tract, larynx, lung, stomach, and other sites have evaluated whether exposure to 
acid mists affected the cancer risk (see Table 2.2, available at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/
Monographs/vol100F/100F-28-Table2.2.pdf ).
491IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
2.2.1 Cancer of the nasal cavity and sinuses
Incident cases of sinonasal (ICD-9 160) cancer 
in Piedmont, Italy, were matched with hospital 
controls from the ear/nose/throat and ortho -
paedics departments over a four-year period. 
For those whose histology was basocellular, 
mucoepidermoid, neuroendocrine, undifferenti -
ated, or unspecified, ever having been exposed to 
acid mists at work was associated with a higher 
risk for these cancers (OR, 7.5; 95%CI: 2.0–28) 
(d’Errico et al., 2009 ).
2.2.2  Cancer of the larynx
In Uruguay, 112 men diagnosed with 
laryngeal cancer between 1993 and 1995 were 
compared with 509 controls with cancer at other 
sites: there was an OR of 1.2 (95%CI: 0.6–2.5) for those who had been occupationally exposed to 
acid mists for up to 20 years, while the OR for 21 
or more years of exposure was 1.8 (95%CI: 1.1–3.1) (De Stefani et al ., 1998 ). Soskolne et al . (1992)  
assessed the duration and intensity of exposure to sulfuric acid among laryngeal cancer cases in a case–control study in Canada and found a dose–
response progression from ≤  10 years of prob -
able exposure (OR, 1.97; 95%CI: 0.6–6.1) to > 10 
years of substantial exposure (OR, 5.6; 95%CI: 
2.0–15.5). Zemła et al. (1987)  asked 328 men with 
laryngeal cancer and 656 controls without cancer 
about “constant exposure to vapours of sulfuric, 
hydrochloric, or nitric acid” and reported a rela -
tive risk of 4.27 ( P < 0.001). In five other studies 
(Olsen & Sabroe, 1984; Cookfair et al ., 1985 ; 
Brown et al ., 1988 ; Eisen et al ., 1994 ; Shangina 
et al., 2006 ) no increased risks, or elevations that 
were not statistically significant, were found (see 
Table 2.2, on-line).
2.2.3  Cancer of the lung
Risks for cancer of the lung in association 
with exposure to acid mists, sulfuric or hydro -
chloric acid, or “any inorganic acid or base” have been reported from six case–control studies (see Table 2.2, on-line). No increased risks were found in three nested case–control studies ( Bond 
et al., 1986 ; Bond et al., 1991 ; Moulin et al., 2000 ; 
Grimsrud et al ., 2005 ) in the USA, France and 
Norway, or in an ecological study in Lithuania 
(Petrauskaite et al., 2002 ). 
2.2.4  Cancer at other sites
Three studies compared information on 
death certificates. The limitations of this type of study include possible misclassification, e.g. 
when the death certificate lists occupation and industry only for the most recent job rather than for the longest employment. Data on possible 
confounders are often lacking as well.
In two studies from the USA an increased 
risk for cancer of the stomach was found associ -
ated with exposure to sulfuric acid, which was 
derived from a job-exposure matrix applied to the occupation and industry indicated on the 
death certificates ( Cocco et al ., 1998 , 1999 ; see 
Table 2.2, on-line). Nearly 42000 certificates for 
deaths from stomach cancer were compared with 
certificates for decedents from non-malignant 
diseases. White men with low, medium, or high exposures to sulfuric acid, showed increasing ORs 
(p for trend < 0.01) for stomach cancer, compared 
with those not exposed to sulfuric acid. For black men the increase was more moderate, and for 
women – among whom only 17 of 16864 were 
rated as having high exposure to sulfuric acid – the ORs were lowest for the high-intensity group 
(Cocco et al ., 1999 ). A smaller study of cancer 
of the gastric cardia (ICD-9 151.0) compared 
1056 men who died of this cancer with 5280 
men who died of non-malignant disease. Men 
ever-exposed to sulfuric acid showed an OR of 1.2 (95%CI: 1.0–1.4), and increasing probability and increasing intensity of exposure were both 
associated with a significant P  for trend (< 0.05 
for probability, < 0.01 for intensity) ( Cocco et al., 
1998 ).
Another US study based on death certificates 
evaluated breast-cancer risk and exposure to 
492Strong inorganic acid mists
acid mists, comparing 33509 cases and 117 794 
controls. Homemakers had been excluded, as 
well as controls who had died of other cancers. 
Thus excluding women with a low probability of exposure, those with the highest level of expo -
sure to acid mists had statistically significantly elevated ORs for breast cancer, i.e. 1.16 (for whites) and 1.44 (for blacks), after adjustment for 
age and imputed socioeconomic status ( Cantor 
et al., 1995 ).
3. Cancer in Experimental Animals
No data were available to the Working Group.
4. Other Relevant Data
See the Monograph  on ‘Isopropyl Alcohol 
Manufacture by the Strong-acid Process’ in this volume.
5. Evaluation
There is sufficient evidence  in humans for the 
carcinogenicity of mists from strong inorganic acids. Mists from strong inorganic acids cause 
cancer of the larynx.
Also, a positive association has been observed 
between exposure to mists from strong inorganic acids and cancer of the lung.
No data on the carcinogenicity of mists from 
strong inorganic acids in experimental animals were available to the Working Group.
While it is plausible that areas of localized 
low pH from inhalation of inorganic acid mists could damage DNA and increase cancer risks, the evidence supporting DNA-damage induc -
tion or any other mechanism as the cause of the observed cancers due to the inorganic acid mists is weak.
Mists from strong inorganic acids are carci -
nogenic to humans (Group 1) .References

4954971. Exposure Data
1.1 Manufacturing process
Foundries produce shaped castings from 
re-melted metal ingots and scrap. Although 
foundry work is assumed to start with re-melting 
of ingots and scrap and to end with the fettling of castings, the industry is often so integrated that 
the distinction is not obvious. Machine shops 
are not normally part of the work environment where castings are produced; however, simple 
and accessory machining may be carried out, 
and these activities may be part of small foundry operations. The processes in iron and steel 
founding generally comprise pattern-making, 
moulding and core-making, melting, pouring and shake-out, and fettling. A detailed descrip -
tion of these production steps can be found in IARC (1984) .
1.2 Human exposures
The iron and steel industry is very diverse 
in materials and processes, resulting in occupa -
tional exposures to a wide variety of substances. Substantial exposures to silica and carbon monoxide continue to occur in many foundries. Occupational exposures to airborne polycyclic 
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are also present, 
resulting mainly from the thermal decomposi -
tion of carbonaceous ingredients commonly 
added to foundry sand. In addition, some steel-
foundry workers (e.g. fettlers) are exposed to airborne chromium and nickel compounds. The 
introduction of organic binder materials in the 
late 1950s has resulted in exposures of foundry workers to other chemicals, including phenol, 
formaldehyde, isocyanates and various amines.
Earlier exposure studies have been reviewed 
previously ( IARC, 1984 ). More recent studies are 
presented here and summarized in Table 1.1 .
1.2.1  Respirable dust and respirable quartz
Nearly all production workers in iron and 
steel foundries are exposed to silica dust and other mineral constituents of foundry sand 
(IARC, 1984 ). In a study from Sweden, the 
‘furnace and ladle repair workers’ and fettlers 
were the highest exposed individuals. For the 
furnace workers ( n = 33), geometric mean levels 
of respirable dust and respirable quartz were 
1.2 mg/m
3 (range, 0.25–9.3) and 0.052 mg/m3 OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURES DURING IRON 
AND STEEL f OUNDING
Iron and steel founding was considered by previous IARC Working Groups in 1983 and 
1987 ( IARC, 1984,  1987 ). Since that time, new data have become available, which have been 
incorporated in this Monograph , and taken into consideration in the present evaluation.IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F

(range, 0.0098–0.83), respectively. For the fettlers 
(n = 115), geometric mean levels of respirable dust 
and respirable quartz were 0.69 mg/m3 (range, 
0.076–31) and 0.041 mg/m3 (range, 0.004–2.1), 
respectively. Major improvements with respect 
to occupational hygiene in the foundries showed 
maximum average concentrations of respirable dust being almost equal to the minimum average 
concentrations for various jobs in the past 
(Andersson et al ., 2009 ). A study from Taiwan, 
China in a continuous steel-casting plant showed 
similar respirable dust levels ( Chen et al., 2006 ).
1.2.2  Carbon monoxide
Carbon monoxide (CO) is formed whenever 
there is incomplete combustion of carbonaceous material. In the foundry environment, CO is 
mainly produced by cupola melting and casting operations. Other sources of CO exposure are 
oil burners used for charge and ladle preheating, 
furnaces for annealing and carburizing, trans -
port equipment powered by internal combustion 
engines and fettling operations such as welding 
and flame cutting. Workers in the furnace area may be exposed to gases leaking from the 
charging and bottom levels of the cupolas ( IARC, 
1984 ).
Results of recent measurements of exposure 
levels to CO in iron and steel foundries were not 
available to the Working Group.
1.2.3  Binder compounds
Organic binder materials for cores and 
moulds include furan, phenol-formaldehyde, 
urea-formaldehyde and urethane resins as well 
as oleo-resinous oils. These ingredients may volatilize into the workplace air during mixing, 
blowing, ramming, drying or baking operations. 
Curing reactions and thermal decomposition give rise to formation of additional compounds, 
which are released during pouring and shake-
out. When organic binders are subjected to high temperatures, pyrolysis may produce gases and smoke aerosols. Only a few components of 
these emissions have been identified: aliphatic 
components include methane, ethane, ethylene, acetylene, and smaller amounts of high molec -
ular-weight compounds; aromatic substances include benzene, toluene, xylenes, naphtha -
lenes and a variety of PAHs in lower concentra -
tions. Nitrogen compounds such as ammonia, cyanides and amines may be formed from the nitrogen-containing urea, ammonium salts 
and hexamethylenetetramine that are used as 
binder chemicals. Urethane resins may emit free isocyanates under moulding and pouring condi -
tions. No-bake catalysts, based on arylsulphonic acids, may produce sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulphide by thermal processes. If phosphoric acid 
is used as a catalyst, phosphine can be formed 
in the strongly reducing atmosphere of the hot emissions. In air, phosphine rapidly oxidizes to 
phosphorus oxide. Furan binders contain free 
furfuryl alcohol, which can volatilize during mixing, moulding or core-making. Similarly, 
furan and phenolic resins may emit formalde -
hyde, phenol and other derivatives by volatili -
zation or thermal decomposition. Core oils and alkyd-isocyanate resins are partly composed of 
natural drying oils, and heating of these materials gives rise to acrolein, various aldehydes, ketones, 
acids and esters as well as aliphatic hydrocarbons. 
When organic solvents are used in sand binders, the vapours may add to the exposure of workers 
(Toeniskoetter & Schafer, 1977 ; IARC, 1984 ).
A study from Sweden by Westberg et al. (2005)  
showed that core-makers had higher average exposure to formaldehyde that casters who were 
more exposed to methyl-isocyanate and isocy -
anic acid. All four Swedish foundries using the 
Hot Box core-binder system were included in 
this study.
502Iron and steel founding
1.2.4  Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
PAHs result from thermal decomposition 
of carbonaceous ingredients in foundry sand. 
During casting, PAHs are formed and partly 
vapourised under the extremely hot and reducing conditions at the mould-metal interface. They 
are then adsorbed onto soot, fume or sand parti -
cles and spread throughout the workplace during 
shake-out and other dusty operations. Although 
the mechanism of PAH formation is complex 
and variable, the reactions proceed via pathways that involve free radicals. Various radical species 
containing carbon atoms combine in rapid 
fashion at the temperature range of 500–800 °C. This pyro-synthesis is influenced by many vari -
ables, such as the composition of the gaseous atmosphere and the chemical structure of the carbonaceous material. Organic binders, coal 
powder and other carbonaceous additives are the 
predominant sources of PAHs in iron and steel foundries. In some cases, exhaust gases from 
engines, furnaces and ovens may increase the 
exposure of workers to these compounds ( IARC, 
1984 ).
Studies from the late 1980s in Denmark 
showed low levels of exposure to PAHs in the foundry workplace atmosphere ( Hansen et al ., 
1994 ; Table 1.1 ).
1.2.5  Metals
Metal fumes are formed by evaporation, 
condensation and oxidation of metals in air. 
Furnace tenders, melters, casters, ladle-men, 
pourers and crane drivers are exposed to fumes from molten metal; fettlers are exposed to metal 
fumes and dusts from grinding, welding and 
flame-cutting operations ( IARC, 1984 ).
Apostoli et al. (1988)  measured concentrations 
of thallium in urine of workers in two cast-iron foundries (with 9 and 12 subjects, respectively) employed in cupola furnace operating and iron 
casting. These workers were potentially exposed to coke dust. The mean urinary thallium concen -
trations were higher for the cast-iron foundry workers ( n  =  21; mean, 0.33 μg/l; range, 0.06–
1.04) than for non-exposed individuals ( n = 72; 
mean, 0.22 μg/l; range, 0.06–0.61), but lower than those of cement workers ( n = 30; mean, 0.38 μg/l; 
range, 0.08–1.22).
In a study from the United Kingdom, concen -
trations of 14 elements in the blood of workers with 
low-alloy steel and stainless steel, and of workers exposed to lead- and cadmium-containing dusts 
were measured and compared with values of 
similar measurements in an unexposed control group. Concentrations of 20 elements in dust 
samples were also measured. The only elements 
that showed significantly elevated levels in whole blood were cadmium in workers with non-ferrous 
metals and lead in all workers. The values for lead 
were 97.2 ± 39.9 ppb in 19 workers with low-alloy steel, 74.9 ± 25.1 ppb in 20 workers with stainless 
steel, and 54.0 ± 18.2 ppb in 42 controls. The high 
concentrations cadmium and lead in the dusts confirmed the exposure of the workers ( Triger 
et al., 1989 ).
In a Danish study conducted over a 16-month 
period in 1996–1997, manganese concentra -
tions were measured in air, and in blood from 24 furnace-men employed in three small-size foundries and from 21 scrap-recycling workers 
at another plant. Furnace-men who work in 
poorly ventilated smelting departments were found to have higher levels of manganese in 
their blood (approx. 2.5 ± 5 μg/L above reference 
values) despite low concentrations of manganese in fumes (0.002 ± 0.064 mg/m
3) (Lander et al ., 
1999 ).
In a Taiwan, China study among 63 steel-
production workers, Horng et al . (2003)  meas -
ured urinary concentrations of cadmium, cobalt, 
nickel and lead by use of differential-pulse strip -
ping voltammetry. Mean concentrations of the 
metals were elevated: cadmium: 9.52 μg/L, range, 
3.19–22.07; cobalt: 8.18 μg/L, range, 3.06–23.30; 
nickel: 33.10 μg/L, range, 13.90–78.90; lead: 
503IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
53.50 μg/L, range, 28.90–85.60. Age and duration 
of employment were correlated with the urinary 
concentrations of these metals. [The limited 
information provided on the actual job content of the workers did not give insight whether these 
workers were employed in primary steel produc -
tion or in the steel foundry.]
1.2.6  Refractory ceramic fibres
In a study on refractory ceramic fibres (RCF) 
from Belgium, ferruginous bodies mimicking asbestos were detected in nine of 1800 bron -
choalveolar lavage samples collected during 
1992–1997 ( Dumortier et al ., 2001 ). The nine 
individuals from whom these samples originated had been employed either as foundry worker, steel worker, or welder and the majority had 
worked on furnace insulation. Mean airborne 
fibre concentrations measured during installa -
tion or removal of RCF furnace insulation are 
close to 1 fibre/mL air ( Maxim et al ., 1997 ), but 
concentrations as high as 23 fibres/mL have been 
detected ( Strübel & Faul, 1994 ).
Two Finnish steel plants, three foundries and 
a repair shop were studied for the presence of airborne ceramic fibres under normal produc -
tion and maintenance conditions (i.e. during the replacement of oven insulation). While ceramic fibres were found in most production 
phases (range < 0.01–0.29 fibres/cm
3), consider -
ably higher fibre counts were obtained during maintenance work (range <  0.01–14.2 fibres/
cm
3). Results from nasal sampling were found to 
correlate with the airborne fibre concentrations 
at the group level. The mean fibre concentrations 
varied from 34 to 930 fibres/cm3 of lavage fluid 
(Linnainmaa et al., 2007 ).2. Cancer in Humans
2.1 Cohort studies
There are 13 cohort studies available on iron 
and steel founding workers in various parts of 
the world. Nearly all of these show a signifi -
cantly increased risk for lung cancer, either in 
the entire cohort or in high-exposed subgroups 
(Koskela et al ., 1976 ; Gibson et al ., 1977 ; Tola 
et al ., 1979 ; Sitas et al ., 1989 ; Andjelkovich 
et al ., 1990 , 1992 , 1995 ; Moulin et al ., 1993 ; 
Sorahan et al ., 1994 ; Adzersen et al ., 2003 ; 
Hoshuyama et al ., 2006 ; see Table 2.1, available 
at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/
vol100F/100F-29-Table2.1.pdf ). There was a non-
significantly increased lung-cancer risk in one 
study ( Decoufle & Wood, 1979 ). In the cohort 
study from the United Kingdom ( Sorahan et al ., 
1994 ) an internal dose–response in terms of years 
of employment was found. A study from the USA 
showed a significantly increased lung-cancer 
risk after adjustment for smoking ( Andjelkovich 
et al ., 1994 ). There are two additional cohorts, 
based on proportional mortality, that provide supporting evidence for an excess of lung cancer in foundry workers ( Egan-Baum et al ., 1981 ; 
Silverstein et al., 1986 ).
2.2 Case–control studies
Two population-based case–control studies, 
one from the USA ( Blot et al ., 1983 ) and one 
from Poland ( Becher et al ., 1989 ), showed a 
statistically significant excess of lung cancer in association with foundry work, with adjust -
ment for smoking (see Table  2.2, available at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100F/100F-29-Table2.2.pdf ).
504Iron and steel founding
2.3 Synthesis
Considering the consistent findings in the 
available cohort studies and the positive evidence 
from two case–control studies, the epidemio -
logical data clearly support the notion that work 
in iron and steel foundries is associated with an 
increased risk for lung cancer. Chance, bias and 
confounding are not likely to explain the excess risk.
3. Cancer in Experimental Animals
No data were available to the Working Group.
4. Other Relevant Data
4.1 Mechanistic evidence relevant to 
the carcinogenic hazards from 
occupational exposures during 
iron and steel founding
4.1.1  Experimental systems
In several studies extracts of particulates 
from samples collected at a steel foundry were 
mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium  strain 
TA98 in the presence or absence of an exogenous 
metabolic activation system. In another study 
filter extracts were mutagenic in Salmonella 
typhimurium  strains TA98 and TA100 in the 
presence or absence of an exogenous metabolic 
activation system ( IARC, 1984 ).
Exposures in the iron and steel founding 
industry are complex and include a wide variety of known genotoxic and carcinogenic substances 
including PAHs, metals (e.g. nickel, chromium) and formaldehyde. These agents have been previ -
ously reviewed by IARC (1983 , 1990 , 1995 , 2010) .
4.1.2  Humans
Workers in a Finnish iron foundry with 
occupational exposure to PAHs and control 
subjects without occupational exposure were examined for the presence in peripheral white 
blood cells of aromatic DNA adducts by use of 
32P-postlabelling. There was a significant corre -
lation between the estimated exposures and 
DNA-adduct levels ( Phillips et al ., 1988 ; Reddy 
et al ., 1991 ). The competitive ELISA assay was 
used to study another population of foundry workers with respect to the presence of aromatic 
DNA-adducts, which showed a positive trend with exposure ( Santella et al., 1993 ). Foundry workers 
studied over a period of five years were evaluated for aromatic DNA adducts in their leukocytes. During this time exposure to PAHs decreased 
and the level of DNA adducts decreased also. In 
the total group exposure was related to the level of DNA adducts ( Perera et al ., 1994 ; Hemminki 
et al., 1997 ; Perera et al., 2000 ).
4.2 Synthesis
There is moderate evidence that extracts of 
particles collected from a steel foundry act via a 
genotoxic mechanism, based on bacterial muta -
tion studies. There is weak evidence for a geno -
toxic mechanism of action for exposures during iron and steel founding, based on DNA-adduct 
studies.
5. Evaluation
There is sufficient evidence  in humans for 
the carcinogenicity of occupational exposures 
during iron and steel founding. Occupational 
exposures during iron and steel founding cause cancer of the lung.
No data on the carcinogenicity to experi -
mental animals of mixtures present in iron and steel founding were available to the Working 
Group.
Occupational exposures during iron and steel 
founding are  carcinogenic to humans (Group 1) .

1.1 Description of paint products
Paint is a suspension of finely divided 
pigment particles in a liquid composed of a 
binder (resin), a volatile solvent or water, and 
additives that impart special characteristics. The volatile components evaporate from the drying 
film after application, while the binder holds 
the pigment in the dry film, causing it to adhere to the substrate. Some high quality, hard gloss 
paints are referred to as enamels.
The basic components of paints vary widely 
in terms of chemical composition, depending on the colour, the durability, and other required 
properties of the paint. Table  1.1  lists the main 
substances and classes of chemicals present in 
paints, to which workers may be exposed in the 
painting trades.
Thousands of chemical compounds are 
used in paint products as pigments, extenders, binders, solvents, and additives. Azo pigments that contain 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine are common, 
although free aromatic amines are not present in significant quantities. Asbestos was used as a filler until the early 1990s. The main organic solvents 
used in paints are toluene, xylene, aliphatic 
compounds, ketones, alcohols, esters, and glycol ethers. Nowadays, solvent-based paints contain much less solvent – and less hazardous solvents – than a decade ago. In some cases the solvent 
content is reduced to such an extent that the 
amounts of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released from the paint are similar to those from 
water-based paints.
Several hazardous chemicals (including 
benzene, phthalates (plasticizers), chromium, and lead oxides) have been reduced or replaced 
in paint in some countries, although they are still used elsewhere. The increasing use of water-based 
paints and powder coatings has promoted this 
trend. New formulations contain lower-toxicity solvents, biocides, and neutralizing agents, such 
as amines.
1.1.1  Pigments and fillers
Paints may contain pigments, dyes and fillers. 
Hazardous pigments and fillers, especially chro -
mate- or lead-based substances, are increasingly 
replaced by other compounds, even though many of the new products have a lower performance in 
corrosion protection or mechanical properties 
of the paint layers. Many paints for industrial or individual use are lead- and chromate-free, 
especially in western Europe, but the situation is 
extremely diverse and complex across countries worldwide.OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE AS A PAINTER
Occupational exposure as a painter was considered by previous Working Groups in 1988 and 
2007 ( IARC, 1989 , 2010a ). Since that time new data have become available, which have been 
incorporated in this Monograph,  and taken into consideration in the present evaluation.IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F

(a) Pigments
Pigments can be classified as inorganic and 
organic ( Bentley & Turner, 1998 ; Stoye & Freitag, 
1998 ; Brock et al ., 2000 ; Smith, 2002 ) and they 
are generally added in considerable propor -
tion (3–60% by weight) to paint formulations to 
provide colour, opacity, and sheen. Pigments also 
affect the viscosity, flow, toughness, durability, 
and other physical or chemical characteristics of the coating (e.g. corrosion-protective properties). 
The diameter of pigment particles is generally 
less than 3 μm, but for special performance the particle size can be up to 15 or 20 μm ( Oyarzún, 
2000 ).
Today the most common pigment employed 
in paint is the white pigment titanium dioxide, 
TiO
2 (IARC, 2010b ). It occurs in two different 
crystal forms – rutile and anatase – with distinct colour properties. The rutile crystal structure has 
an almost 25% greater opacity than the anatase form. Because of its chemical inertness, extreme 
whiteness, excellent covering power and lack 
of toxicity compared with white lead, titanium dioxide is the predominant component in the 
manufacture of white paint, representing 90% of 
all pigments on the market worldwide. The most important black pigment in paints is carbon 
black (micro-crystalline carbon, 10–40 nm, 
graphite-similar), which belongs to the inorganic pigments ( Buxbaum & Pfaff, 2005 ; IARC, 2010b ).
In the 1960s, there were probably more than 
200 different organic pigments used in paints. At the time, azo pigments such as Benzidine Yellow 
were considered to have relatively low toxicity, 
and were widely used. These pigments have relatively low solubility, and although they are 
based on the aromatic amine 3,3 ′-dichloroben -
zidine, the free amine is not readily bioavail -
able. Three 3,3 ′-dichlorobenzidine-based paint 
pigments were commonly used in architectural 
finishes in the mid-to-late 1960s. Benzidine was used as the basis for the paint-pigment pyra -
zolone maroon ( IARC, 2010c ). The free aromatic amines used in the synthesis of azo pigments can be found in trace amounts as impurities. The 
aromatic amines 4-aminobiphenyl, benzidine, 
2-naphthylamine and 2-methyl-4-chloroaniline [4-chloro- ortho -toluidine] have been found in 
azo pigments ( IARC, 2010c ).
(b) Dyes
Dyes, unlike pigments, are soluble in paint 
medium. Dyes are used only in a few instances or products, because they provide much less long-term stability against light and other influ -
ences. Examples of use of dyes are in transparent wood stains ( Zollinger & Iqbal, 2003 ), and as 
transparent colourants in automobile coatings 
(Streitberger & Dössel, 2008 ).
1.1.2  Binders (resins)
The ‘vehicle’ part of paints contains compo -
nents collectively termed ‘binders’ or film formers. Almost all binders in modern paint 
films are composed of polymer materials such as resins and drying oils, whose main functions 
are to provide film hardness, gloss, and surface 
adhesion, as well as resistance of the film to weather influences, air pollutants that stimulate 
corrosion through the atmosphere, acids, alkalis, 
and other agents ( Stoye & Freitag, 1998 ; Brock 
et al., 2000 ; Müller & Poth, 2006 ). A large variety 
of natural and synthetic binders or resins, mostly synthetic, have been used in paints.
(a) Natural resins and oils
Shellac and insect exudations are natural 
oleoresins that have been used in paints for 
centuries. Another useful natural resin is rosin 
(colophony), which is obtained as a residue after 
distilling pine oleoresin for the production of turpentine. Vegetable and fish oils have long 
been used as binders in traditional paints and 
varnishes. White linseed oil has been the most important oil in standard exterior paints, despite 
its relatively slow drying rate. Other important 
515IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
oils include castor oil, tall oil, soya-bean oil, 
coconut oil, cottonseed oil, tung oil and various 
fish oils ( Brock et al., 2000 ).
(b) Synthetic resins
A wide variety of synthetic resins have been 
commercially available since the early 1900s. 
Those that have been most frequently used in paints, varnishes and lacquers include cellulose-
based resins, phenolic, alkyd, vinyl, acrylic and 
methacrylic resins, polyester and polyurethane resins, chlorinated rubber derivatives, styrene-
butadiene, and silicone oils. Mixtures of synthetic 
resins provide characteristic properties that cannot be obtained from a single resin. While 
the amount of resin in paint varies, concentra -
tions of 20–60% by weight are not uncommon.
1.1.3  Solvents
Since the early 1900s, the number of solvents in 
paints has increased considerably to encompass a broad range of petroleum and coal-tar distillates, 
alcohols, esters, ketones, glycols, synthetic glycol ethers and esters (mainly ethylene-derived), and 
propylene glycol derivatives, as well as a large 
variety of mixtures of these chemical classes. The choice of solvent depends on properties such 
as adequate polarity, possibility of hydrogen-
bonding, volatility and vapour pressure, cooling effects during atomization, surface tension, 
viscosity, flash point, flammability and – more 
and more importantly – lack of adverse physi -
ological effects. In western Europe, derivatives 
of ethylene-glycol  monoethyl-ether (ethyl glycol) 
have been removed from many formulations 
since the 1980s. Since 1990, the use of styrene 
has been restricted by legislation in the European 
Union. Water-based coatings generally require water-soluble solvents such as glycol ethers 
(butyl glycol), n -butanol or, less commonly, 
N-methyl-pyrrolidone.1.1.4  Additives
Additives are defined as chemicals that have 
a specific function or impart a special property to paints or coatings. They are present at low 
concentrations (generally 0.1–5% by weight) and include surfactants and dispersing agents, driers, 
rheological agents, plasticizers, biocides, anti-
skinning agents, antifoam agents (de-foamers), corrosion inhibitors, light (UV) stabilizers and 
catalysts ( Stoye & Freitag, 1998 ; Brock et al ., 
2000 ). Many additives are adapted to the new 
paint systems by modification of existing prod -
ucts rather than by the development of new ones.
(a) Surfactants and dispersing additives
Anionic, cationic, amphoteric or non-ionic 
surfactants are used in paints as pigment disper -
sants (in both non-aqueous and aqueous systems), 
emulsifying agents, protective colloids, wetting 
agents and antifoaming agents. Dispersants 
employed in non-aqueous paints include leci -
thin, zinc or calcium naphthenate or octoate, 
oleates, oleic acid, polyurethanes, polyamides 
and other chemicals. Dispersants in aqueous paints include polyphosphates, pyrophosphates, 
salts of arylalkyl-sulfonic acids and salts of poly -
carboxylic acids, e.g. polyacrylic acid ( Oyarzún, 
2000 ; Müller & Poth, 2006 ). Surfactants used in 
water-based paints include aluminium stearate, 
cellulose ethers, polydimethyl siloxanes, poly -
ethylene, alkali metal phosphates and sodium 
dioctyl sulfosuccinate.
A variety of other surface-active agents 
are added to paints to control flow, levelling, sagging, settling and viscosity. These include 
hydrogenated castor oils, lecithin, metallic soaps (e.g. linoleates, palmitates and stearates), treated 
montmorillonite clays, peptized oil gels, polyol 
esters, siloxan-polyester resins, silicas, and soap solutions ( Brock et al., 2000 ; Müller & Poth, 2006 ). 
Mineral oils and specially modified siloxanes are used as antifoaming agents.
516Occupational exposure as a painter
(b) Driers
Driers (siccatives) used in solvent-based 
and water-based paints containing unsaturated 
polymers are principally metal salts – lead, 
calcium, cobalt, manganese, zirconium, vana -
dium, barium, zinc, cerium and lanthanum 
– of naphthenic acid, tall-oil acid, 2-ethylhex -
anolic acid and neodecanoic acid, generally at concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 0.8% ( Brock 
et al ., 2000 ). Cobalt-based driers are the most 
commonly used commercially as active catalysts in both air-drying and heat-cure systems. Other metal-containing siccatives serve as auxiliary 
driers and are generally used in combination 
with cobalt- and manganese-based driers. Lead-containing products were at one time the major 
auxiliary driers, but legislation that limits the 
amount of lead used in coatings has practically eliminated its use during the period 1990–2000 
(IARC, 2006 ). The most suitable replacements for 
lead are reported to be zirconium, calcium and 
cobalt-zirconium compounds ( Müller & Poth, 
2006 ).
(c) Rheological additives
The rheological properties of a coating mate -
rial influence its optimal performance during application (‘good flow without dripping’) as well as its storage life. Water-soluble hydrophilic 
colloids that are used as rheological additives 
include agents such as gum arabic, gum traga -
canth, starch, sodium alginate, methyl cellu -
lose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, ammonium caseinate, polyurethane derivates, and polyacrylates. Acrylate salts, casein and 
cellulose-derived compounds are widely used 
in acrylic paints, while the major thickeners for styrene–butadiene paints are alkali-soluble 
proteins (e.g. soy-bean proteins). Methyl cellu -
lose and hydroxyethyl cellulose are common 
thickeners for polyvinyl acetate paints ( Brock 
et al., 2000 ).Agents used in water-based and solvent-
based paints as rheological additives not derived 
from cellulose include maleic anhydride copoly -
mers, mineral fillers such as colloidal attapulgite 
(IARC, 1997 ), treated magnesium montmorillo -
nite clays, pyrogenic silicic acid (SiO2), natural 
products (e.g. alginic acid, casein and soya-bean 
protein), polyacrylamides, polyacrylic acid salts 
and acid-containing cross-linked acrylic emul -
sion copolymers ( Brock et al., 2000 ).
(d) Plasticizers
Plasticizers are generally added in quantities 
of up to about 2% by weight and include dibutyl-, 
diethyl-, diethylhexyl- and dioctylphthalates. To 
a lesser extent, plasticizers also contain the low molecular-weight esters of adipic and sebacic 
acid, tributyl phosphate, and castor oil. Polyester 
resins, including maleic residues, sulfonamides, tri-ortho -cresyl phosphate and chlorinated 
diphenyls, are used occasionally ( Stoye & Freitag, 
1998 ).
(e) Biocides (fungicides, preservatives, and mildew killers)
Water-based paints contain organic substances 
and represent an ideal growth medium for fungi, 
algae and bacteria. With the reduced content of 
residual monomers and organic solvents (which often have anti-microbial action), there is a greater 
risk for microbial contamination in the new 
formulations. The growth of  microorganisms in 
the coating or subsequently in the film can be 
reduced or even prevented by adding chemical 
biocides to the paint in concentrations below 1% by weight ( Brock et al ., 2000 ; Schwartz & 
Baumstark, 2001 ).
In-can preservatives  protect the paint against 
microbial growth during production, transporta -
tion and storage. Substances commonly used for this purpose are formaldehyde – now less and less common – and its reaction products with alcohols, 
amines and amides, as well as N ,S-heterocyclic 
compounds such as isothiazolinones and 
517IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
chloroacetamide ( Brock et al ., 2000 ). In-film 
preservatives , also encompassing antifouling 
additives  in marine paints, protect the applied 
paint against attack by bacteria, moulds, algae 
or mosses. Substances currently in use for this 
purpose include several S- and N-containing 
chemicals, cyclic compounds such as dithiocar -
bamates, thiophthalimide derivates, benzimida -
zole derivates and trialkyl compounds, as well as 
ecologically harmful substances such as organic mercury compounds ( Brock et al., 2000 ).
(f) Anti-skinning agents
Anti-skinning agents are added to paints to 
retard the formation of skin on the surface of 
the liquid coating, in either closed or open cans, 
without delaying the drying of the product. The principal anti-skinning agents are oximes 
(e.g. methyl ethyl ketoxime, butyraldoxime, 
cyclohexanone oxime) and phenol deriva -
tives (methoxyphenol, ortho -aminophenol, 
poly-hydroxyphenol). Small quantities of cresols, guaiacol, hydroquinone ( IARC, 1999 ), 
 isobutoxysafrol and lignocol have also been used 
as anti-skinning agents.
(g) Corrosion inhibitors
Corrosion inhibitors can be divided into inor -
ganic pigments and organic inhibitors ( Brock 
et al ., 2000 ). Red lead and chromate-containing 
pigments are both chemically and electrochemi -
cally active. Pigments containing red lead are 
still used in heavy-duty anti- corrosion systems, because they possess excellent protection prop -
erties. Some zinc chromates are still essential for the protection of aluminium on aircraft. Lead- and chromate-containing anti-corrosion 
pigments are increasingly being substituted by 
phosphates (zinc, chromium(III), aluminium, calcium and magnesium phosphates). Zinc-dust 
primers are widely used in the protection of steel 
structures. The synthetic micaceous iron-oxide pigment haematite (Fe
2O3) acts via a physical 
mechanism, mainly by the barrier effect of its crystal-lattice structure (platelets). The most important compound in the group of organic 
inhibitors is the zinc salt of 5-nitrophthalic acid.
(h) Asbestos
In the early twentieth century, asbestos was 
used as a filler to improve the technical properties 
of paints, particularly those used in shipyards and on bridges. The paints may have contained up to 
about 20% asbestos by weight. Usage decreased 
after about 1950, although special textured paints or coatings continued to be widely used in home 
decoration until the early 1990s. These paints 
contained approximately 5% chrysotile asbestos by weight ( Williams et al., 2007 ).
(i) Nanoparticles
The use of 0.5–5% (w/w) nanoparticles 
(10–100 nm) remarkably improves the proper -
ties of paint layers in terms of scratch resistance, hardness, gloss, weather stability, and cross-linking and hardening properties. Nanoparticles 
are present as single particles only at the time of 
manufacturing. They increase in effective size by agglomeration and by absorption of polymers 
and surface-active agents onto their surface. 
During drying of the paint, the particles continue to agglomerate and are incorporated irreversibly 
into the polymer matrix.
1.2 Human exposure
Workers in the painting industry are poten -
tially exposed to the chemicals found in paint products during their application and removal. 
Exposure to dichloromethane occurs during paint stripping from wood and metal surfaces. 
Diisocyanate is present in some binders and 
is released during painting. Silica is used in the preparation of surfaces before painting. 
As bystanders during construction or demoli -
tion activities, painters may also be exposed 
to asbestos or crystalline silica. During the 
518Occupational exposure as a painter
application of paint, workers are exposed prima -
rily to solvents, whereas the mechanical removal 
of paint mainly leads to exposure to pigments 
and fillers. In the past, exposure to hazardous substances frequently exceeded current occupa -
tional exposure limits, but exposure levels have generally decreased over time.
Exposure, both by inhalation and via skin 
contact, occurs specifically in operations that involve manual handling during prepara -
tion of the paint, such as weighing ingredients 
(pigments, extenders, resins, additives), loading 
them into mixing equipment, adding solvents to mills, and cleaning equipment (mixers, mills, 
reactors, kettles, tanks, filters). Additional expo -
sure to solvents occurs during thinning, tinting 
and shading, during filling operations, and 
during the filtering of varnishes. The cooking 
of varnishes may produce emissions of various aldehydes such as acrolein, of phenol, ketones, 
glycerine and fatty acids as well as dusts or 
vapours of maleic, phthalic and fumaric anhy -
drides during the loading of kettles. The produc -
tion of powder coatings can be associated with significant exposure to dust from resin powders, pigments, curing agents and other additives. In 
the manufacture of radiation-curable coatings, 
exposures may occur to monomers such as ethyl acrylate, other acrylates, and photo-initiators. 
While inhalation and cutaneous contact are the 
major routes of exposure, ingestion related to personal work habits constitutes another poten -
tial route of entry.
Bio-monitoring of workers exposed to paints 
has shown elevated levels of paint compounds or 
their metabolites in blood and urine. Appropriate 
selection and use of personal protective equip -
ment can substantially reduce uptake, although 
painters do not generally wear respirators or 
gloves.
The main substances to which workers may 
be exposed are listed in Table  1.1 . Quantitative 
studies of occupational exposure in the major painting trades are summarized in IARC (2010a) .As indicated above, the use of 0.5–5% (w/w) 
nanoparticles (10–100 nm) remarkably improves 
several properties of paint. Because these parti -
cles agglomerate and become incorporated irre -
versibly into the polymer matrix, painters are not exposed to single nanoparticles as such. Since 
nanoparticles are made by special manufacturers and sold as aqueous or solvent-based slurry 
because of their strong potential for agglomera -
tion, workers in paint manufacture do not come 
into contact with nanoparticles ( Aitken et al ., 
2006 ).
2. Cancer in Humans
Occupational exposure as a painter was 
classified as a Group-1 carcinogen in IARC 
Monograph  Volume 47 ( IARC, 1989 ), based on 
an increased risk for lung cancer, and reaffirmed in Monograph  Volume 98 ( IARC, 2010a ), based 
also on increased risks for mesothelioma and bladder cancer. The recent Working Group noted that there was limited evidence , based primarily 
on studies of maternal exposure, that painting is associated with childhood leukaemia. The epide -
miological evidence on occupational exposure 
as a painter did not allow identification of the 
specific carcinogenic agent in paint.
2.1 Cancer of the lung
2.1.1  Cohort studies
Eighteen independent cohort studies of 
painters – excluding reports with substantial 
population overlap – have investigated the asso -
ciation between occupation as a painter and 
lung cancer ( OPCS, 1958 , 1972 , 1979 , 1986 , 1996 ; 
Guralnick, 1963 ; Dunn & Weir, 1965 ; Menck & 
Henderson, 1976 ; Whorton et al ., 1983 ; Dubrow 
& Wegman, 1984; Gubéran et al ., 1989 ; Hrubec 
et al ., 1995 ; Alexander et al ., 1996 ; van L oon 
et al ., 1997 ; Boice et al ., 1999 ; Steenland & Palu, 
519IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
1999 ; Pronk et al ., 2009 ; Pukkala et al ., 2009 ; 
see Table  2.1, available at http://monographs.
iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100F/100F-30-
Table2.1.pdf ). Overall, these studies have shown 
a significantly increased incidence or mortality 
from lung cancer, with a magnitude of effect 
that was relatively consistent between studies. Several of these studies were adjusted for tobacco 
smoking ( Dunn & Weir, 1965 ; Hrubec et al ., 
1995 ; van L oon et al., 1997 ; Pronk et al., 2009 ).
2.1.2  Case–control studies
Thirty independent case–control studies of 
lung cancer that reported on the association with occupation as a painter demonstrated relatively 
consistent increased risks for lung cancer (gener -
ally ranging between 1.10 and 2.70) ( Wynder 
& Graham, 1951 ; Breslow et al ., 1954 ; Viadana 
et al ., 1976 ; Williams et al ., 1977 ; Milne et al ., 
1983 ; Kjuus et al., 1986 ; Lerchen et al., 1987 ; Levin 
et al., 1988 ; Ronco et al., 1988 ; Vineis et al., 1988 ; 
Zahm et al ., 1989 ; Bethwaite et al ., 1990 ; Burns 
& Swanson, 1991b ; Siemiatycki, 1991 ; Morabia 
et al ., 1992 ; Notani et al ., 1993 ; Wu-Williams 
et al ., 1993 ; Finkelstein, 1995; De Stefani et al ., 
1996 , 2005 ; Muscat et al ., 1998 ; Wünsch-Filho 
et al., 1998 ; Jahn et al., 1999 ; Pezzotto & Poletto, 
1999 ; Brüske-Hohlfeld et al ., 2000 ; Matos et al ., 
2000 ; Pohlabeln et al ., 2000 ; Bouchardy et al ., 
2002 ; Richiardi et al ., 2004 ; Baccarelli et al ., 
2005 ; Zeka et al ., 2006; see Table  2.2, available 
at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/
vol100F/100F-30-Table2.2.pdf ). Twenty-seven of 
these studies showed positive associations (with statistically significant or borderline signifi -
cant results in 15 studies) and three studies had odds ratios below 1, but not statistically significant ( Morabia et al ., 1992 ; Wünsch-Filho 
et al., 1998 ; Baccarelli et al., 2005 ). All except six 
studies adjusted for tobacco smoking ( Wynder & 
Graham, 1951 ; Breslow et al ., 1954 ; Milne et al ., 
1983 ; Bethwaite et al ., 1990 ; Finkelstein, 1995; 
Bouchardy et al., 2002 ).2.1.3  Meta-analyses
Two comprehensive meta-analyses of the 
epidemiological literature on painters and lung 
cancer have been published since the previous 
Monograph  (IARC, 2010a ).
One meta-analysis included 39 studies (23 
case–control and 16 cohort studies) ( Bachand 
et al., 2010 ). Summary risk estimates were derived 
and sensitivity analysis performed to evaluate 
smoking, socioeconomic status and exposure 
variables. Overall summary risk estimates for lung cancer were 1.29 (95%CI: 1.10–1.51) for 
case–control studies, and 1.22 (95%CI: 1.16–1.29) 
and 1.36 (95%CI: 1.34–1.41) for cohort studies, respectively. The 20 case–control studies that 
adjusted for smoking gave a summary relative 
risk (RR) of 1.32 (95%CI: 1.10–1.59). Only one of the cohort studies included in the meta-analysis 
adjusted for smoking and an external adjust -
ment for smoking demonstrated an increased 
mortality from lung cancer in painters. [The 
Working Group noted that the methods for 
external adjustment for smoking were not clearly described.]
Guha et al . (2010a)  performed a meta-anal -
ysis to assess the association between occupa -
tion as a painter and lung cancer. Forty-seven 
independent studies (18 cohort and 29 case–
control studies) were included. Overall, a statis -
tically significant increased risk for lung cancer 
was observed (meta-relative risk, 1.35; 95%CI: 
1.29–1.41). When the analysis was restricted to smoking-adjusted estimates, the summary rela -
tive risk was 1.35 (95%CI: 1.21–1.51). On the basis of data from three studies that investigated risk in never smokers, the meta-relative risk was 2.00 
(95%CI: 1.09–3.67). The increased risk persisted 
when the analysis was restricted to studies that adjusted for other occupational exposures (RR 
1.57; 95%CI: 1.21–2.04). A duration–response 
relationship was also identified: the meta-relative risk for < 10 years of exposure was 1.13 (95%CI: 
0.77–1.65) and 1.95 (95%CI: 1.26–3.02) for > 10 
520Occupational exposure as a painter
years of exposure; similarly, the meta-RR was 
1.37 (95%CI: 0.89–2.13) for < 20 years of expo -
sure and 2.00 (95%CI: 1.01–3.92) for > 20 years (the reference category was no exposure).
2.2 Mesothelioma
The association between occupation as a 
painter and mesothelioma was investigated in 
four cohort studies ( Malker et al ., 1990 ; Peto 
et al ., 1995 ; Brown et al ., 2002 ; Pukkala et al ., 
2009 ) and two case–control studies ( Teschke 
et al ., 1997a ; Pan et al ., 2005 ). An increase in 
mortality from mesothelioma was observed in 
each of the four cohort studies, with borderline 
significant relative risks ranging from 1.31 to 
1.70. The two case–control studies on mesothe -
lioma also showed an increased risk (OR, 4.5; 
95%CI: 1.0–23.7; 6 exposed cases; and OR, 2.6; 
95%CI: 1.3–5.3; 31 exposed cases, respectively) for persons ever employed as painters.
[The Working Group noted that it is 
improbable that the presence of asbestos would completely explain the excess of lung cancer; if 
this had been the case, a more pronounced excess 
of mesothelioma would have been observed.]
2.3 Cancer of the urinary bladder
2.3.1  Cohort studies
The association between occupational expo -
sure as a painter and urinary bladder cancer 
was investigated in 11 cohort studies, excluding 
reports with substantial population overlap (OPCS, 1958 , 1972 , 1979 , 1986 ; Guralnick, 1963 ; 
Whorton et al., 1983 ; Gubéran et al., 1989 ; Hrubec 
et al ., 1995 ; Steenland & Palu, 1999 ; Zeegers 
et al ., 2001 ; Pukkala et al ., 2009)  see Table 2.3, 
available at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100F/100F-30-Table2.3.pdf ). 
Two of the cohort and record-linkage studies 
controlled for tobacco smoking ( Hrubec et al ., 
1995 ; Zeegers et al ., 2001 ). Overall these studies showed consistent increases in incidence of or 
mortality from urinary bladder cancer.
2.3.2  Case–control studies 
Several case–control studies have investi -
gated the association between urinary bladder 
cancer and occupation as a painter. Thirty-one 
independent case–control studies were identified (Wynder et al ., 1963 ; Cole et al ., 1972 ; Decouflé 
et al., 1977 ; Williams et al., 1977 ; Howe et al., 1980 ; 
Schoenberg et al ., 1984 ; Morrison et al ., 1985 ; 
Coggon et al ., 1986 ; Iscovich et al ., 1987 ; Risch 
et al ., 1988 ; Silverman et al ., 1989a , b; Bethwaite 
et al ., 1990 ; La Vecchia et al ., 1990 ; Burns & 
Swanson, 1991a ; Barbone et al ., 1994 ; Teschke 
et al., 1997b ; Golka et al., 1999 , 2008 ; Bouchardy 
et al., 2002 ; Pelucchi et al., 2002 ; Zheng et al., 2002 ; 
Kogevinas et al., 2003 ; Colt et al., 2004 ; Gaertner 
et al., 2004 ; Band et al., 2005 ; Reulen et al., 2007 ; 
Dryson et al ., 2008 ; Ramanakumar et al ., 2008 ; 
Kobrosly et al ., 2009 ; see Table 2.4, available at 
http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100F/100F-30-Table2.4.pdf ). Three studies 
showed no association ( Howe et al ., 1980 ; Colt 
et al ., 2004 ; Ramanakurmar et al ., 2007 ) and 
six reported odds ratios less than 1.0, although none were statistically significant ( Morrison 
et al ., 1985  – the United Kingdom and Japanese 
populations; Williams et al., 1977 ; Coggon et al., 
1986 ; Iscovich et al., 1987 ; Gaertner et al., 2004 ). 
Twenty-two case–control studies demonstrated an increased risk for bladder cancer associ -
ated with occupation as a painter. Although the 
results of three studies were statistically signifi -
cant ( Silverman et al., 1989a , b; Golka et al., 1999 ; 
Band et al ., 2005 ) and those of six studies were 
of borderline statistical significance ( Wynder 
et al ., 1963 ; Decouflé et al ., 1977 ; Risch et al ., 
1988 ; Bethwaite et al ., 1990 ; Zheng et al ., 2002 ; 
Kogevinas et al., 2003 ), all studies that showed an 
increased risk for bladder cancer among painters 
were relatively consistent in the magnitude of the 
effect reported.
521IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
2.3.3  Meta-analyses
Five meta-analyses have also demonstrated 
a significant or borderline significant increased 
incidence of or mortality from bladder cancer 
among persons occupationally exposed as a painter ( Yamaguchi et al ., 1991 ; Chen & Seaton, 
1998 ; Bosetti et al ., 2005 ; Bachand et al ., 2010 ; 
Guha et al ., 2010b ). The two most recent meta-
analyses are highlighted below. 
The meta-analysis by Bachand et al.  (2010)  
included 40 case–control and 11 cohort studies. Overall bladder-cancer summary risk estimates 
were 1.28 (95%CI: 1.17–1.41) for case–control 
and 1.14 (95%CI: 1.06–1.22) and 1.27 (95%CI: 1.16–1.38) for cohort morbidity and mortality 
studies, respectively. The 33 case–control studies 
that adjusted for smoking gave a summary RR of 1.30 (95%CI: 1.17–1.44). None of the cohort 
studies adjusted for smoking. When an external 
adjustment for smoking was applied to the meta-analysis of the cohort studies, an increased 
incidence of and mortality from bladder cancer 
persisted. [The Working Group noted that the methods for the external adjustment for smoking 
were not clearly described.]
A separate meta-analysis of 41 independent 
studies (11 cohort and record-linkage studies and 30 case–control studies) conducted by 
Guha et al.  (2010b)  showed a meta-relative risk 
of 1.25 (95%CI: 1.16–1.34). This association 
did not change significantly when the analysis 
was restricted to population-based studies or studies that adjusted for smoking and other 
potentially confounding occupational expo -
sures. Furthermore, exposure-response analyses 
suggested that the risk increased with duration 
of employment: those exposed < 10 years had a 
lower risk (meta-RR, 1.41; 95%CI: 1.00–2.01) than those exposed > 10 years (meta-RR, 1.81; 95%CI: 
1.20–2.75) (reference category was no exposure).2.4 Childhood leukaemia
2.4.1  Maternal exposure 
The association between maternal expo -
sure during painting and childhood leukaemia was evaluated in nine population-based case–
control studies ( van S teensel-Moll et al ., 1985 ; 
Lowengart et al ., 1987 ; Buckley et al ., 1989 ; Shu 
et al ., 1999 , 2004 ; Schuz et al ., 2000 ; Freedman 
et al ., 2001 ; Alderton et al ., 2006 ; Scélo et al ., 
2009;  see Table  2.5, available at http://mono -
graphs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100F/100F-30-Table2.5.pdf ). Most of the studies presented 
results for the combined exposure to paints, 
stains, and lacquers. Shu et al . (2004)  presented 
a case-only analysis that examined whether 
maternal exposure to paint was associated 
with development of mutation in the RAS  gene 
in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) cases 
compared with ALL cases without RAS  muta -
tion and, therefore, is not directly relevant to the discussion of whether maternal exposure during painting increases the risk for childhood 
leukaemia compared with healthy controls.
In five studies significant positive associa -
tions were found between maternal exposure during painting, either before or during preg -
nancy, and acute leukaemia ( van S teensel-Moll 
et al ., 1985 ; Lowengart et al ., 1987 ), acute non-
lymphoblastic leukaemia (ANLL) ( Buckley et al., 
1989 ); and ALL ( Shu et al ., 1999 ; Schuz et al ., 
2000 ). All these studies controlled for age and/or 
sex, race, social class (measured through income, 
socioeconomic status, or degree of urbaniza -
tion) or other variables. Additionally, borderline 
significant positive associations were found with 
ALL ( Freedman et al ., 2001 ; Scélo et al ., 2009 ) 
and non-significantly elevated ORs for ALL 
and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) ( Alderton 
et al ., 2006 ). Furthermore, significant exposure-
response relationships, according to duration of maternal exposure to paint, were observed in 
two studies ( Buckley et al., 1989 ; Shu et al., 1999 ).
522Occupational exposure as a painter
2.4.2  Paternal exposure
The association between paternal exposure 
during painting and childhood leukaemia was 
considered in 12 population-based case–control 
studies ( Fabia & Thuy, 1974 ; Hakulinen et al ., 
1976 ; Kwa & Fine, 1980 ; Hemminki et al ., 1981 ; 
Sanders et al., 1981 ; Gold et al., 1982 ; van S teensel-
Moll et al ., 1985 ; Lowengart et al ., 1987 ; Buckley 
et al ., 1989 ; Shu et al ., 1999 ; Schuz et al ., 2000 ; 
McKinney et al ., 2003;  (see Table  2.6, available 
at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/
vol100F/100F-30-Table2.6.pdf ). In three of the 
four case–control studies on ALL, non-significant positive associations were found ( van S teensel-
Moll et al ., 1985 ; Schuz et al ., 2000 ; McKinney 
et al., 2003 ) and in the only case–control study of 
ANLL ( Buckley et al.,1989 ) a significant, positive 
association was observed. Of the eight studies 
that considered combined leukaemia subtypes, 
positive associations were found in five (either significant or borderline significant) ( Fabia & 
Thuy, 1974 ; Hemminki et al ., 1981 ; Gold et al ., 
1982 ; Lowengart et al ., 1987 ; McKinney et al ., 
2003 ), while there was no association in two 
studies ( Kwa & Fine, 1980 ; Sanders et al., 1981 ).
2.5 Lympho-haematopoietic cancers
The risk for lymphatic and haematopoietic 
cancers among painters was evaluated in 21 
case–control studies ( Persson et al ., 1989 , 1993 ; 
Lindquist et al ., 1987 ; La Vecchia et al ., 1989 ; 
Bethwaite et al ., 1990 ; Heineman et al ., 1992 ; 
Scherr et al ., 1992 ; Blair et al ., 1993 ; Demers 
et al ., 1993 ; Mele et al ., 1994 ; Nordström et al ., 
1997 ; Clavel et al ., 1998 ; Persson & Fredrikson, 
1999 ; Blair et al ., 2001 ; Costantini et al ., 2001 ; 
Adegoke et al ., 2003 ; Dryver et al ., 2004 ; Kato 
et al., 2005 ; Colt et al., 2007 ; Ramanakumar et al., 
2008 ; Purdue et al ., 2009 ). Although increased 
risks were observed, the results were inconsistent 
and the data are inadequate to draw a conclusion 
about the association between occupation as a painter and the risk for lymphatic and haemat -
opoietic cancers.
2.6 Other cancers
A few case–control studies of cancers of 
the upper aerodigestive tract (oral cavity, nose, pharynx, nasopharynx, larynx, and oesophagus), 
stomach, pancreas, liver, colon, rectum, kidney, brain, prostate, testis, ovary and breast, and of 
melanoma and soft–tissue sarcoma have been 
conducted among painters ( Tarvainen et al. , 
2008 ; IARC, 2010a ). Results were inconclusive 
for all sites.
2.7 Synthesis
The Working Group reviewed a large body of 
epidemiological evidence evaluating the associa -
tion between occupational exposure as a painter and the risk for lung cancer (30 case–control studies, 18 cohort studies), urinary bladder 
cancer (30 case–control studies, 11 cohort 
studies) and mesothelioma (2 case–control studies, 4 cohort studies). This evidence demon -
strates that occupational exposure as a painter is causally associated with the risk for cancer of the lung and urinary bladder, and for mesothelioma. 
The Working Group noted that the magnitude 
of the effect was consistent across studies and the elevated risks persisted after controlling for 
other occupational exposures and for tobacco 
smoking. Increased risks for these cancers were also observed in never smokers and current 
non-smokers. Several studies that demonstrated 
significant positive duration-response relation -
ships support this evaluation.
The Working Group noted that no particular 
agent could be identified from epidemiological studies as the specific cause of the excess of lung 
and urinary bladder cancers. It is improbable 
that the presence of asbestos in paint would completely explain the excess of lung cancer; if 
523IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
this had been the case, a more pronounced excess 
of mesothelioma would have been observed. 
There is little information from epidemiological 
studies on the risk associated with the use of paint pigments that are known lung carcinogens, 
such as chromium or cadmium.
There is evidence suggesting a causal associa -
tion between maternal exposure during painting and childhood leukaemia in the offspring. 
Although there were few studies and expo -
sure assessments were relatively poor, all of the 
studies showed significant positive associations 
after adjusting for potential confounders such as age and/or sex, race and social class, although 
confounding or recall bias could not be ruled out.
The evidence is inconclusive for cancer at 
other sites.
3. Cancer in Experimental Animals
No data were available to the Working Group.
4. Other Relevant Data
The chemicals discussed below are common 
components of paints: benzene, toluene, chlorinated solvents (dichloromethane, 
 trichloroethylene), xylenes, metals (cadmium, 
chromium, inorganic lead), styrene, PAHs, and 
aromatic azo dyes.
4.1 Toxicokinetics and metabolism
4.1.1  Solvents
(a) Aromatic hydrocarbons
The aromatic hydrocarbons present in paints 
(benzene, toluene, xylenes and styrene) are 
absorbed mainly through inhalation, although 
oral or dermal exposure could be important as 
well. They are metabolized primarily in the liver by oxidation, in a process catalysed mainly by the 
CYP2E1 enzyme:(i) Benzene
The toxicokinetics of benzene is reviewed in 
the Monograph  on Benzene in this volume.
(ii) Toluene
Toluene is metabolised to benzyl alcohol 
followed by oxidation to benzoic acids, which 
are excreted as conjugates with glycine or with UDP-glucuronate ( ATSDR, 2000a ).
(iii) Xylene
All three isomers of xylene are metabolised 
to methylbenzyl alcohol and conjugated with 
glycine to form methylhippuric acid. Aromatic 
hydroxylation of xylene to xylenol occurs to only a limited extent in humans. About 90% of 
the absorbed xylene is excreted in the urine as 
methylhippuric acid, and less than 2% as xylenol. Approximately 5% is eliminated unchanged in 
exhaled air ( ATSDR, 2007b ).
(b) Chlorinated solvents
(i) Dichloromethane
Dichloromethane (DCM) is absorbed mainly 
into the bloodstream after inhalation and is found 
in highest concentration in adipose tissue and 
liver. DCM can be metabolised by the cytochrome 
P450(CYP)-associated enzyme CYP2E1 to form formyl chloride, CO and CO
2, and by GSTT1-1 
to carbon dioxide via a postulated glutathione-
conjugate ( S-chloromethyl  glutathione), and to 
formaldehyde. Both pathways can give rise to 
toxic metabolites. After inhalation exposure, 
humans eliminate dichloromethane mainly in 
expired air, but also in the urine ( ATSDR, 2000b ).
(ii) Trichloroethylene
Trichloroethylene (TCE) is also absorbed 
mainly into the bloodstream after inhalation and is widely distributed in the liver, kidneys, and the 
cardiovascular and nervous systems.
Trichloroethylene is mainly metabolized 
in the liver through an oxidative pathway by CYP isoenzymes and through conjugation with 
524Occupational exposure as a painter
glutathione ( Davidson & Beliles, 1991 ; Lash et al., 
2000a ), leading to the formation of major metab -
olites such as chloral hydrate, trichloroethanol 
and trichloroacetic acid. Four CYP isoforms play a role in TCE metabolism: CYP2A1/2, 
CYP2B1/2, CYP2C11/6 and CYP2E1 ( Koop 
et al ., 1985 ; Nakajima et al ., 1988 ; Guengerich & 
Shimada, 1991 ; Lash et al ., 2000a ). The resulting 
metabolites are thought to be associated with 
liver toxicity and liver carcinogenesis in animals. The glutathione conjugation pathway leads to 
the formation of dichlorovinyl glutathione and 
dichlorovinyl cysteine. The latter can be further metabolized by β-lyase to reactive chemical 
species that are thought to play a role in the 
toxicity of TCE in the proximal renal tubules and in the renal carcinogenicity of TCE in animals. 
The CYP pathway is thought to predominate and 
formation of reactive species via the glutathione S-transferase (GST) pathway is less important 
(Lash et al., 2000b ).
4.1.2  Metals
Metal compounds used as paint pigments 
such as cadmium, chromium, and inorganic 
lead, are predominantly absorbed in the lung. 
Dermal absorption is generally low and depends on the chemical properties of the compound, the 
vehicle, and the integrity of the skin. Absorbed 
metals are distributed to the organs and, in the case of lead, are concentrated in the bone. 
Elimination of metals varies from several days 
to several years.
(a) Cadmium
Cadmium (Cd) enters the body mainly by 
inhalation in the working environment, whereas 
the general population is exposed via food and 
drinking-water. Fractional intestinal absorption 
is influenced by dietary factors and increases with dietary Cd concentration, while pulmo -
nary fractional absorption depends partly on the solubility of cadmium. Cd and other agents induce synthesis of metallothionein, a protein that binds to cadmium and transfers it via the 
blood, primarily to the liver and the kidney. In 
the kidney, the complex is filtered through the renal glomeruli and then reabsorbed from the 
filtrate in the proximal tubules where the protein 
portion is rapidly degraded to release Cd. As a result, most of the body burden of Cd is retained 
in the liver and kidneys (where the half-life is esti -
mated to be 7–16 years ( IARC, 2012 ). Excretion 
occurs mainly via the urine and, in individuals without renal dysfunction, primarily reflects 
the amount of cadmium retained in the kidneys (IARC, 1993 ).
(b) Chromium
The toxicokinetics of chromium compounds 
depend on the solubility and particle size, on 
the valence state of the chromium atom and the 
nature of its ligands. Absorption of chromium(VI) compounds is higher than that of chromium(III) 
compounds, the latter occurring via passive diffu -
sion and phagocytosis. Absorption of inhaled 
chromium compounds takes place in the lung 
via transfer across cell membranes and in the 
gastrointestinal tract from particles cleared from the lungs. Absorption after dermal exposure 
depends on the physical and chemical properties 
of the compound, the vehicle, and the integrity of the skin. Once taken up in the blood, chromium 
compounds are distributed to all organs, with 
highest concentrations in kidney, liver and bone (NTP, 2010 ).
Particles containing chromium can be 
retained in the lung for years after occupational exposure ( ATSDR, 2000c ). After exposure by 
inhalation, excretion occurs predominantly via the urine, and after oral exposure via the faeces, due to low absorption of chromium compounds 
from the gastrointestinal tract ( ATSDR, 2008).
525IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
(c) Lead compounds, inorganic lead
Lead compounds have been used in paints 
as primers, pigments and driers. Lead can be 
absorbed after inhalation, oral or dermal expo -
sure. Patterns and rates of particle deposition are highly dependent on size and ventilation rate. However, all lead settled deep in the lung is even -
tually absorbed. Dermal absorption of inorganic lead is negligible, although slightly increased by high perspiration in humans. Absorption from 
the gastrointestinal tract in both humans and 
experimental animals is strongly influenced by age, fasting/fed status, nutrition, solubility, 
and particles size. Absorbed lead is rapidly 
 distributed from plasma into erythrocytes, soft  
tissues and – mainly – bone. Bone can be a 
 significant source of endogenous lead, in partic -
ular when the resorption rate is increased, such 
as during pregnancy, lactation, and just after the 
menopause. After oral ingestion, absorbed lead is 
primarily excreted in the urine and, via the bile, in the faeces. Inorganic lead that has not been 
absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract is excreted 
in the faeces ( IARC, 2006 ).
4.1.3  Other compounds
(a) Styrene
Styrene is used as polyester resin in paints. 
After inhalation, oral intake, or dermal absorp -
tion, styrene is rapidly distributed throughout 
the body, with the highest concentrations found 
in adipose tissue ( IARC, 1994 , 2002 ). In humans, 
styrene is metabolised to the predominant first 
metabolite, styrene-7,8-oxide, principally by 
CYP2E1, CYP2F, but also by CYP2B6. Isolated erythrocytes are also capable of non-enzymatic 
conversion of styrene totyrene-7,8-oxide. After 
its oxidation, a large percentage of styrene is excreted as urinary mandelic and phenylgly -
oxylic acids; glutathione conjugates represent a minor fraction of the metabolites of styrene-7,8-oxide ( IARC, 1994 , 2002 ).(b) PAHs
PAH exposure during painting occurs 
through the use of special waterproof coatings or by pyrolysis of paint residues during removal. 
There are more than 100 different PAHs, which 
generally occur as complex mixtures rather than single compounds, but their identity is 
unknown in paints. Therefore, the toxicokinetics 
is discussed in broad general terms. Little is known about the toxicokinetics of PAH mixtures 
or individual PAHs in humans and most of the 
available data come from benzo[ a]pyrene in 
experimental studies (described in IARC, 2010d;  
see also the Monograph  on Benzene elsewhere in 
this volume).
(c) Aromatic amines and azo dyes
The toxicokinetics of aromatic amines and 
azo dyes, such as 4-aminobiphenyl, benzidine, 
benzidine-based dyes and 2-naphthylamine, 
are described in IARC Monograph  Volume 99 
(IARC, 2010c ) and in the Monographs  on these 
agents elsewhere in this volume.
4.2 Genetics and related effects
4.2.1  Genotoxicity
(a) Chromosomal aberrations, micronuclei, and 
sister chromatid exchange
Six of eight studies on chromosomal aber -
rations among painters reviewed in IARC 
Monograph  Volume 98 ( IARC, 2010a ) showed 
consistent and significant elevated frequencies, 
and three of these studies reported an associa -
tion with years of employment ( Silva & Santos-
Mello, 1996 ; Pinto et al., 2000 ; Gajalakshmi et al., 
2002 ) while the others did not report analyses on 
duration of employment ( Capomazza & Botta, 
1990 ; Piña-Calva et al., 1991 ; Testa et al., 2005 ).
Several chromosomal abnormalities could 
be detected in the bone marrow of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). In a study by 
526Occupational exposure as a painter
Crane et al. (1996) , routine cytogenetic data from 
213 patients (129 enrolled in the period 1976–
1983 and 84 enrolled in the period 1986–1990) 
with AML were correlated with environmental exposures to organic chemicals (e.g. benzene), 
paints, pesticides, and other substances such as 
dyes, glues, or varnishes. A suggestive associa -
tion was found between exposure to paints and 
the −7/7q chromosomal abnormality but this was 
non-significant and only observed in the set of patients enrolled between 1986 and 1990.
In a study in Columbia, chromosomal aber -
rations were evaluated in 200 unexposed control subjects and in 200 car-painters recruited from 
several workshops. Painters were exposed for at 
least five years to the same commercial thinners, a complex mixture which contains toluene, isobu -
tane, xylene, hexane, ethyl-benzene, and octane. After exclusion of current smokers, ex-smokers and those under medical treatment, the chro -
mosomal aberration frequency was signifi -
cantly higher in exposed workers compared with controls. The chromatid-type aberration 
was the most common aberration found in both 
groups, and was significantly higher in painters compared with controls, whereas no statistical 
difference was detected between frequencies of 
chromosome-type aberration in exposed workers and controls ( Hoyos-Giraldo et al., 2009 ).
Five of six studies reported significant 
increases in the frequency of micronuclei among painters ( Diaz et al., 1990 ; Di Giorgio et al ., 1994 ; 
Lemasters et al ., 1997 , 1999 ; Pinto et al ., 2000 ; 
Martino-Roth et al ., 2003 ; Testa et al ., 2005 ). 
Chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei 
were found both in cultured lymphocytes and 
in buccal cells. Significantly increased frequen -
cies of sister chromatid exchange were found in 
four of seven studies among painters ( Haglund 
et al ., 1980 ; Kelsey et al ., 1988 , 1989 ; Cullen 
et al ., 1992 ; Sardas et al ., 1994 ; Lemasters et al ., 
1997 , 1999 ; Pinto et al ., 2000 ; Testa et al ., 2005 ). 
Exposure–response relationships with duration 
of employment were reported in three of these studies ( Sardas et al., 1994 ; Lemasters et al., 1997 , 
1999 ; Pinto et al., 2000 ).
(b) DNA strand-breaks
Increased levels of DNA single-strand breaks 
among painters were reported in three of four 
studies ( Oesch et al ., 1994 ; Fuchs et al ., 1996a , 
b; Zhu et al ., 2001 ; Martino-Roth et al ., 2003 ); a 
dose-gradient with years or weeks worked and the cytogenetic end-point which remained after 
adjusting for smoking was found in two ( Oesch 
et al., 1994 ; Zhu et al., 2001 ). These data strongly 
suggest that occupational exposures in painting lead to increased levels of DNA damage.
(c) Aromatic DNA adducts
In a study among 208 Korean workers, aromatic 
DNA adducts assessed by 
32P-postlabelling tended 
to be higher in paint users (particularly coal-tar 
paint users) compared with on-site controls. 
When the data from general painters and coal-tar painters were combined, they showed higher 
adduct levels than on-site controls ( Lee et al ., 
2003 ).
4.2.2 Genetic effects for some individual 
constituents of paints
(a) Benzene
See Section 4 of the Monograph  on Benzene 
in this volume.
(b) Toluene
Toluene is mainly converted to benzyl alcohol 
and excreted as hippurate. Human data are 
inconclusive with regards to the genotoxicity of 
toluene. Studies in exposed workers are limited 
by concurrent exposure to other chemicals, small cohort size, and a lack of historical expo -
sure monitoring, and it is likely that the methods are not sufficiently sensitive to detect small, but significant, manifestations of genetic toxicity 
(ATSDR, 2000a ). In some cytogenetic studies in 
527IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
occupationally exposed populations, increases 
in chromosomal aberrations (two studies), 
micronuclei (one study) and DNA strand-breaks 
(one study) have been reported. Genotoxicity testing in experimental systems (rats, mice and 
cultured mammalian cells including studies 
on DNA strand-breaks) has been limited and has produced mostly negative results ( Chen 
et al., 2008 ). DNA-adduct formation has not been 
detected ( IARC, 1999 ).
Higher frequencies of micronucleated 
polychromatic erythrocytes (PCE) have been observed in mice following co-exposure to benzene and toluene via inhalation at lower and 
intermittent co-exposures, compared with mice 
exposed to benzene or toluene alone ( Wetmore 
et al ., 2008 ). The authors suggested that, at the 
doses used in this study (50 ppm for benzene and 100 ppm for toluene), toluene could enhance benzene-induced clastogenic or aneugenic bone-
marrow injury.
(c) Xylene
Genotoxicity studies on mixtures of xylenes 
and on the individual isomers of xylene have 
provided consistently negative results in a variety of in vitro  and in vivo  assays and test systems 
(bacteria, yeast, cultured mammalian cells, mice, rats, and humans). Xylenes may cause DNA fragmentation indirectly, i.e. at cytotoxic 
concentrations because of nucleases released 
from lysosomes in dying cells. There is some evidence from bacterial test systems suggesting 
that xylene metabolites, specifically meta-
xylenol, para- xylenol, 2,4-dimethylphenol, and 
ortho- methylbenzyl alcohol, are non-mutagenic 
(ATSDR, 2007b ).
(d) Dichloromethane
Dichloromethane is consistently mutagenic 
in microorganisms. Weaker and less consistent responses are seen in mammalian systems, predominantly in mice, both in vitro  and in 
vivo. The compound induced SCE, chromosome breakage, chromosome loss and DNA single-strand breaks in human cells, while results in 
rodent cells were inconclusive or negative ( IARC, 
1999 ). Mechanistic studies have established a link 
between GST-mediated metabolism of dichlo -
romethane and its genotoxicity and carcino -
genicity in mice. The GST enzyme responsible for 
the metabolism of dichloromethane is expressed 
to a significantly greater extent in mouse tissues 
than in rat, hamster or human tissues. The avail -
able data suggest a plausible mechanism for the 
development of liver and lung tumours in mice, 
but not in rats exposed to dichloromethane (IARC, 1999 ).
(e) Trichloroethylene
Studies of structural chromosomal aberra -
tions, aneuploidy and SCE in peripheral lympho -
cytes of workers exposed to TCE were inconclusive but suggested clastogenic effects ( IARC, 1995 ; 
ATSDR, 1997 ). TCE did not induce chromo -
somal aberrations, dominant lethal mutations, SCE or unscheduled DNA synthesis in rodents, whereas an increased induction of micronuclei 
and DNA single-strand breaks or alkali-labile 
sites was observed. Although TCE may not be genotoxic, several of its metabolites are reactive 
and potentially genotoxic substances, suggesting 
that genotoxic effects may be a concern for workers exposed to  trichloroethylene ( ATSDR, 
1997 ; Lash et al., 2000b ; Tabrez & Ahmad, 2009 ). 
Several isomers of 1,2-dichlorovinyl-cysteine, a product of TCE metabolism in the kidney, are 
mutagenic in the in vitro  Ames assay. These prod -
ucts have been identified in the urine of workers 
exposed to TCE.
(f) Cadmium and chromium
The genotoxic effects of cadmium and chro -
mium are described in Section 4 of the Monograph  
on these two metals in IARC Monograph  Volume 
100C ( IARC, 2012 ).
528Occupational exposure as a painter
(g) Inorganic lead
Equivocal results have been published with 
respect to the mutagenicity of water-soluble lead 
compounds in mammalian cells in culture; in 
most classical test systems, effects were weak or 
restricted to toxic doses. In cultures of various mammalian cells and in lead-exposed animals, 
lead acetate, lead chromate and lead nitrate 
induced DNA strand-breaks. Chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei have been shown 
consistently in mammalian cells in culture, in 
experimental animals (in bone-marrow cells of lead-exposed animals) and in several cases 
also in humans occupationally exposed to lead. 
In some studies, these effects were correlated with blood-lead concentrations. However, with 
respect to epidemiological studies, confounding 
exposures cannot be ruled out ( IARC, 2006 ).
Two mechanisms may underlie lead-induced 
genotoxicity, namely a disruption of pro-oxidant/antioxidant balance, at least in part through interaction with the sulfhydryl groups 
of key enzymes, and as a result of interference 
with DNA-repair systems. There is little evidence that lead interacts directly with DNA at blood-
lead concentrations normally encountered. The 
involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in lead-induced genotoxicity has been shown at 
different experimental levels. Molecular mecha -
nisms may be enhanced lipid peroxidation, inhi -
bition of antioxidant defence systems, catalysis of Fenton-type reactions and the inhibition 
of aminolevulinic acid dehydratase. The latter reaction leads to the accumulation of the haeme 
precursor aminolevulinic acid, with the subse -
quent generation of ROS and induction of oxida -
tive DNA damage ( IARC, 2006 ).
Lead interacts with proteins, including those 
involved in DNA repair. Lead has been shown to 
inhibit the apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 
(APE1) at low concentrations (in the micromolar 
range) in cultured AA8 cells, leading to accu -
mulation of a-purinic sites and to an increase in methylmethane sulfonate-induced mutagenicity (McNeill et al., 2007 ). This latter mechanism may 
be responsible for enhancing the genotoxicity of other agents. Furthermore, lead interferes with the repair of DNA double-strand breaks via inter -
action with the stress-response pathway induced by the ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) protein ( Gastaldo et al ., 2007 ). Low concentra -
tions of lead stimulate cell growth via mobiliza -
tion of free intracellular Ca
2+ and activation of 
protein kinase C (PKC), which triggers a signal-
transduction cascade leading to stimulation of 
DNA synthesis ( IARC, 2006 ).
(h) Styrene
Data from studies in experimental systems 
(in vitro  and in vivo ) and from studies in humans 
indicate that exposure to styrene can result in 
the formation of DNA adducts. However, mice, 
but not rats, develop lung tumours after expo -
sure to styrene, even though both species form 
DNA adducts, also in organs other than the 
lung. Circulating styrene 7,8-oxide – the active metabolite of styrene – may also play a role. 
Since the concentration of styrene in blood is 
two orders of magnitude higher in the rat than in the mouse, the lung tumours in mice prob -
ably develop as a result of in situ formation of styrene 7,8-oxide, which causes cytotoxicity, or increased cell proliferation, or DNA-adduct 
formation. It is likely that the proposed mecha -
nism involving conversion of styrene to styrene 
7,8-oxide in mouse Clara cells is not operative in 
human lungs to a biologically significant extent. 
However, based on the observations in human workers regarding styrene 7,8-oxide in blood, 
and DNA adducts and chromosomal damage 
in lymphocytes, it cannot be excluded that this and other mechanisms are important for organs 
other than the lung ( IARC, 2002 ).
529IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
(i) PAHs
Genotoxic effects of PAHs are described in 
IARC Monograph  Volume 92 ( IARC, 2010d ) and 
the Monograph  on benzene in this volume.
After metabolic activation, PAH mixtures 
are genotoxic in humans and individual PAHs 
are genotoxic in experimental systems. In the 
complex mixtures to which humans are exposed, 
some of the genotoxic effects of PAHs can be ascribed to benzo[ a]pyrene and are described in 
Volume 96 ( IARC, 2010d ) and in the Monograph  
on Benzene in this volume.
(j) Aromatic amines and azo dyes
The genotoxic effects of aromatic amines and 
azo dyes such as 4-aminobiphenyl, benzidine, 
benzidine-based dyes and 2-naphthylamine, 
are described in IARC Monograph  Volume 99 
(IARC, 2010c ), and in the Monographs  on these 
specific substances elsewhere in this Volume.
4.2.3  Indirect effects potentially related to 
genotoxicity
(a) Haematological and immunological effects
Haematological changes were observed in 
several studies of painters. These included reduced 
levels of total white blood cells, T-cells and natural 
killer cells ( Moszczyński et al ., 1996 ; Rothman 
et al ., 1997 ; Kim et al ., 1999 ). Furthermore, an 
increased prevalence of leukopenia, anaemia and granulocytopenia was observed among 
painters. Immunological changes were also reported in several studies. These effects included 
specific immunoglobulin (G and E) responses 
to  hexamethylene diisocyanate – an aliphatic 
diisocyanate used in the manufacture of paints 
and surface coating, which can induce asthma 
(Grammer et al ., 1988 ; Cartier et al ., 1989 ; Baur 
et al ., 1996 ; Tee et al ., 1998 ; Redlich et al ., 2001 ; 
Pronk et al., 2007 ) and increased proliferation of 
lymphocytes after in vitro  stimulation with this 
substance (Redlich et al., 2001 ; IARC, 2010a ).4.3 Susceptible populations
Several studies have addressed the interplay 
between genetic factors, biological and clinical 
endpoints and were reviewed in IARC Monograph  
Volume 98 ( IARC, 2010a ). In one study consid -
ering bladder cancer as an endpoint, the slow acetylation status ( N-acetyltransferase 2 pheno -
type) was over-represented in painters ( n = 1 6 ) 
with bladder cancer (88%) compared with their healthy colleagues (65%) ( n = 26) ( Golka et al ., 
2001 ). The effects of the NAT2  polymorphism 
are also described for arylamines in Volume 99 (IARC, 2010c ).
Few studies have addressed the effect of genetic 
polymorphism on biological endpoints. In one study no significant associations were detected 
between any of the biomarker responses (chro -
mosomal aberrations, SCE, micronuclei) and 
either the GSTM1  or GSTT1  genotype. However, 
the small size of the study (25 car painters and 
37 unexposed controls) does not allow definite 
conclusions to be made on the relationship 
between genetic polymorphisms and biomarkers (Testa et al., 2005 ).
In another study, among 181 painters using 
coal-tar paints ( n = 111) or general paints ( n = 70) 
and 27 on-site controls, no gene–environment 
interactions between GSTM1  (all workers, 51% 
GSTM1- null) or GSTT1  (all workers, 54% GSTT1-
null) and aromatic DNA-adduct formation was found among any of the groups exposed ( Lee 
et al., 2003 ).
Only one recent study has addressed the 
interplay between genetic polymorphisms and 
biological endpoints. In this study the effect of polymorphisms in genes involved in metabolism 
of xenobiotics ( CYP2E1 , GSTM1 ) and in DNA 
repair ( XRCC1
194 Arg/Trp , Trp/Trp , XRCC1 280 
Arg/His , XRCC3241 Thr/Met) on chromosomal 
aberration (CA) frequency was investigated (Hoyos-Giraldo et al ., 2009 ). A significant effect 
was observed of the CYP2E1 C1/C1  genotype, 
which increased the CA frequency in exposed 
530Occupational exposure as a painter
workers. Exposed workers with the GSTM1-null  
genotype had a statistically significantly elevated 
CA frequency compared with controls and 
exposed workers with a GSTM1 -positive geno -
type. Exposed workers with XRCC1194Arg/Trp  
and Trp/Trp  genotypes had statistically higher 
CA frequencies compared with those with the XRCC1
194Arg/Arg  genotype. Also, there was an 
association between the XRCC1280Arg/Arg  and 
XRCC3241Thr/Thr  genotypes and a significant 
increase of CA frequency in exposed workers. 
The authors suggested that these wild-type geno -
types may decrease the capacity to repair DNA 
single- and double-strand breaks and influence 
the formation of chromosomal aberrations 
(Hoyos-Giraldo et al., 2009 ).
In most studies that measured a variety of 
cytogenetic end-points and markers of geno -
toxicity, elevated levels of genetic damage were reported in painters. Mechanistic data 
reviewed by ATSDR (1997 , 2000a , b, 2007a , b) 
and by previous IARC Monograph  evaluations 
on selected specific chemicals that had been or still are prevalent in exposures during painting, 
strongly support a role of these substances in the induction of haematopoietic malignan -
cies (benzene, trichloroethylene), liver cancer (trichloroethylene), lung cancer (cadmium, chro -
mium, PAHs) and bladder cancer (aromatic azo 
dyes).
4.4 Synthesis
The multiple genetic and cytogenetic effects 
observed among workers employed as painters or in the paint industry provide strong evidence 
in support of genotoxicity as one mechanism underlying the observed increase in cancer risk. 
However, due to the complexity and changing 
nature of the exposure mixtures and the poten -
tial interactions between exposures as a painter, 
other mechanisms are also likely. While it 
is clear that exposures to some agents in the paint industry have decreased over time, recent cytotoxicity studies and the ongoing exposures to multiple mutagens and carcinogens continue to raise concerns about cancer risks.
5. Evaluation
There is sufficient evidence  in humans for 
the carcinogenicity of occupational exposure as 
a painter. Occupational exposure as a painter 
causes mesothelioma, and cancers of the urinary bladder and lung.
Also, a positive association has been observed 
between maternal exposure to painting (including pre-conception and during pregnancy) and 
childhood leukaemia in the offspring.
No data in experimental animals relevant 
to exposure as a painter were available to the Working Group.
The multiple genetic and cytogenetic effects 
observed among workers employed as painters and the information on individual chemicals 
to which painters are exposed provide strong evidence to support genotoxicity as a mechanism 
underlying the observed increase in cancer risk. 
However, due to the complexity and changing nature of the exposure mixtures and the poten -
tial interactions between exposures as painters, other mechanisms are also likely. While it is clear that exposures as a painter to some agents 
have been reduced over time, recent genotoxicity 
studies and the exposure to multiple mutagens and carcinogens continue to raise concerns about 
cancer risks.
Occupational exposure as a painter is carci -
nogenic to humans (Group 1) .

5395411. Exposure Data
In the context of this Monograph , the rubber 
industry is restricted to the rubber-manufac -
turing industry, including the production of 
tyres and general rubber goods and the process of re-treading. The production of synthetic poly -
mers in chemical plants is not discussed.
1.1 Manufacturing process
Rubber manufacturing generally comprises 
the following operations: raw materials handling, 
weighing and mixing; milling; extruding and 
calendering; component assembly and building; ‘curing’ or vulcanizing; inspection and finishing; 
storage and dispatch. A detailed description of 
these steps in the production process can be found in IARC (1982) .
Although the stages described below are 
applicable to the majority of rubber goods manufactured from solid polymer, a substantial proportion of rubber production involves the use 
of liquid latex. This applies to the manufacture of 
dipped rubber goods (such as rubber gloves and some footwear), foam-latex products (such as 
mattresses, cushions, etc.), and extruded thread products (such as elasticated fabrics and surgical 
hose).
1.1.1  Raw materials handling, weighing and 
mixing
All the materials required for the manu -
facture of the finished product are assembled. 
The raw polymer, either natural or synthetic is 
brought together at this stage with a variety of compounding chemical additives before being 
introduced into a mixer. The extensive range of 
chemicals required and the volume of raw mate -
rial handled can give rise to substantial quanti -
ties of airborne dust.
1.1.2  Milling
From the mixer, the uncured rubber 
compound usually passes to one or more milling 
machines, where it is thoroughly blended to ensure 
an even dispersion of its chemical constituents. At this stage, considerable heat is generated, and, 
although many technical improvements have 
been introduced in recent years, the job of mill operator still involves a considerable degree of 
physical exertion and exposure to fumes arising 
from the heated compound.OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURES IN THE 
RUBBER-MANU fACTURING INDUSTRY
Occupational exposures in the rubber-manufacturing industry were considered by previous 
IARC Working Groups in 1981 and 1987 ( IARC, 1982 , 1987 ). Since that time new data have 
become available, which have been incorporated in this Monograph,  and taken into consid -
eration in the present evaluation.IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
1.1.3  Extruding and calendering
The extruders force the rubber compound 
through a die into various forms, which are then 
cut to appropriate lengths. Strips of softened 
rubber compound are fed into multiple-roll milling machines (calenders) to form rubber 
sheeting, or to apply the rubber directly onto 
woven textile fabric, which can then be wound off onto a roll. During such manufacturing oper -
ations, fumes are often generated.
1.1.4  Component assembly and building
At this stage, solvents are frequently used, 
with the possibility of inhalation of solvent 
vapours or of direct effects of the solvent on the 
skin of the operator.
1.1.5  Curing or vulcanizing
Heat is applied to the product, usually by use 
of steam, in a curing mould, press, or autoclave. 
Operators working in the area are exposed both 
to heat from the presses and to fumes from the heated rubber products. Chemical reactions take 
place throughout the manufacturing process, 
and may give rise to new, more volatile chemicals.
1.1.6  Inspection and finishing
This involves the handling of cured rubber 
products, often while still hot. It usually involves 
direct and extensive skin-contact with the 
surface of the finished article (during inspection) and may also involve exposure to vulcanizing 
fumes. Grinding, trimming, repair, painting and 
cleaning may also entail exposure to rubber dust, fumes and solvents.
1.1.7  Storage and dispatch
Large quantities of stored rubber goods may 
release considerable amounts of toxic substances, 
either as vapours or as constituents of the ‘bloom’ 
on the surface of finished goods.1.2 Chemicals used in the rubber-
production process
A wide variety of natural or synthetic elas -
tomers, fillers (e.g. carbon black, precipitated 
silica or silicates) and additives are used in 
compounding to create the necessary properties of the final rubber product. The actual chemi -
cals used in this process have changed over time and vary extensively depending on the manufac -
turing sector (e.g. tyres, general rubber goods, 
re-treading), and on the specific plant.
Compounding ingredients are classified 
as vulcanising agents (e.g. elemental sulfur, 
sulfur donors such as organic disulphides and higher sulphides, peroxides, urethane cross-linking agents); vulcanization accelerators (e.g. 
sulphenamides, thiazoles, guanidines, thiurams, 
dithiocarbamates, dithiophosphates, and 
miscellaneous accelerators such as zinc isopropyl 
xanthate and ethylene thiourea); vulcanization activators (e.g. zinc oxide, magnesium oxide, lead oxide); retarders and inhibitors of vulcani -
zation (e.g. benzoic acid, salicylic acid, phthalic anhydride, N-nitrosodiphenylamine (NDPA), 
N-(cyclohexylthio)phthalimide); antidegradants; 
antioxidants (e.g. phenolics, phosphites, thioesters, amines, bound antioxidants such as quinone-diimines, miscellaneous antioxidants 
such as zinc and nickel salts of dithiocarbamates); 
antiozonants (e.g. para -phenylenediamines, tria -
zine derivatives, waxes); anti-reversion agents (e.g. zinc carboxylates, thiophosphoryl derivatives, silane coupling agents, sulphenimide acceler -
ator,  hexamethylene-1,6-bis thiosulphate diso -
dium dehydrate, and 1,3-bis(citranimidomethyl)benzene); plasticisers and softeners (e.g. petro -
leum products such as petroleum waxes and mineral oils, coal-tar products such as coumarone resin, pine products, synthetic softeners, and other products such as vegetable oils and fats); 
and miscellaneous ingredients (such as peptising 
agents, blowing agents, bonding agents, and 
pigments) ( Datta & Ingham, 2001 ).
542Rubber-manufacturing industry
1.3 Human exposure
Workers in the rubber-manufacturing 
industry are exposed to dusts and fumes from 
the rubber-making and vulcanization processes. Potential exposures include N -nitrosamines, 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, solvents, and phthalates. Inhalation is the main route of exposure, although workers may have dermal exposure as well (e.g. to cyclohexane-soluble compounds). Details on historical occupational exposures in the rubber-manufacturing industry can be found in the previous IARC Monograph  
(IARC, 1982 ).
Data from studies published since the 
previous evaluation ( IARC, 1982 ) are summa -
rized below. These are mainly from Europe and North America. Hardly any current exposure data from Asia, where production of rubber goods has increased considerably during the last two decades, was available to the Working Group.
Several industry-wide surveys have been 
carried out in the United Kingdom ( Dost et al ., 
2000 ) and in the Netherlands ( Kromhout et al ., 
1994 ; Vermeulen et al ., 2000 ). In these studies, 
inhalable dust concentrations, curing-fume concentrations and solvents were measured. A recent European Concerted Action created a large exposure database for the rubber-manufacturing industry in five countries (the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, and Sweden). The Improved Exposure Assessment for Prospective Cohort Studies and Exposure Control in the Rubber-Manufacturing Industry (EXASRUB) database contains results of 59609 measurements collected from 523 surveys in 333 factories between 1956 and 2003. The database consists primarily of measure -
ments of N -nitrosamines ( n = 21202), rubber dust 
(n = 13655), solvents ( n = 8615) and rubber fumes 
(n = 5932) ( de V ocht et al., 2005 ). The long time-
span and the presence of longitudinal data from several countries provide insight into long-term temporal trends in exposure concentrations in the rubber-manufacturing industry.1.3.1 Dust from rubber processing
An industry-wide survey in the Netherlands 
in 1998 showed geometric mean concentrations 
of inhalable dust that varied from 0.8 to 1.9 mg/m3 
and from 0.2 to 2.0 mg/m3 when analysed by plant 
and by department, respectively. Actual inhalable dust concentrations depended to a large extent 
on specific conditions within the departments of the 10 plants involved in the study ( Kromhout 
et al ., 1994 ). Comparison of the exposure levels 
nine years later revealed a reduction rate of 5.7% per annum for exposure to inhalable particu -
late matter. On average, median inhalable dust concentrations went down from 1.00 mg/m
3 to 
0.59 mg/m3 between 1988 and 1997. The steepest 
decline was observed in companies and depart -
ments with the highest exposure levels in 1988 and in workers with long employment. However, the highest concentrations were still seen in 
the compounding and mixing departments 
(Vermeulen et al., 2000 ).
Dost et al.  (2000)  reported on exposure 
data collected in an industry-wide inventory in the United Kingdom during 1995–97 from 29 re-treading plants, 52 producers of general 
rubber goods, and seven producers of new tyres. 
The results show similar patterns at somewhat elevated levels.
These findings were confirmed in an analysis 
of dust-exposure data (13380 inhalable and 816 respirable dust measurements collected between 
1969 and 2003) in the EXASRUB database. 
Geometric mean inhalable dust concentrations changed by −4% (range −5.8 to +2.9%) per year. 
Significant reductions were found in all five 
participating countries for ‘handling of crude materials and mixing and milling’ (−7% to −4% 
per year) and for ‘miscellaneous workers’ (−11% to 
−5% per year). Average geometric mean personal exposure levels ranged from 0.72 mg/m
3 in the 
Netherlands to 1.97 mg/m3 in Germany. Up to 
4–5-fold differences were observed between 
the countries in the early eighties, but these 
543IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
differences diminished considerably in the two 
decades afterwards. In most countries, personal 
measurements appeared to be on average 2–4 
times higher than stationary measurements (de V ocht et al., 2008 ).
1.3.2  Fumes from rubber curing
Heating and curing of rubber compounds 
generates a visible fume. This fume has a complex 
chemical composition, which makes detailed 
analysis rather difficult. The cyclohexane-soluble fraction (CSF) of total particulate matter has been 
used as an indicator of fume contamination in 
the areas in which the samples were taken. Such monitoring studies are reviewed below.
In the 1988 Dutch industry-wide survey, 
Kromhout et al. (1994)  reported a geometric mean 
CSF concentration of 0.39 mg/m
3 (n = 163) in the 
curing departments of 10 factories. Considerable 
variation was seen between the companies, with 
a range of geometric mean concentrations of 0.21–1.16 mg/m
3.
Median exposures reported for the United 
Kingdom industry-wide study were highest in the general rubber goods companies at 0.40 mg/m
3, 
intermediate for re-treading plants at 0.32 mg/m3 
and lowest for manufacturers of new tyres at 
0.22 mg/m3. Process-specific CSF concentrations 
in rubber goods production were as follows: 0.40 mg/m
3 in moulding, 0.33 mg/m3 in extru -
sion, 0.18 mg/m3 in milling. For re-treading, 
levels were 0.32 mg/m3 for pressing, 0.19 mg/m3 
for extruding and 0.10 mg/m3 for autoclaving 
(Dost et al., 2000 ).
Analysis of 5657 CSF measurements in the 
EXASRUB database collected between 1977 and 
2003 showed an annual decrease in concentra -
tion of 3% (range −8.6% to 0%). Steepest declines were seen in curing (−8.6% per year) and mainte -
nance and engineering departments (−5.4% per 
year) ( de V ocht et al., 2008 ).1.3.3  N-nitrosamines
Nitrosamines in the rubber-manufacturing 
industry are formed in the vulcanising process, with its extensive use of chemicals such as tetram -
ethyl thiuram disulfide, zinc-diethyldithiocar -
bamate and morpholinomercaptobenzothiazole.
Exposures to volatile nitrosamines were 
measured at 24 French rubber-manufacturing 
plants from 1992 to 1995. A total of 709 exposure 
measurements (109 in the personal breathing 
zone, and 600 area samples) were collected. The following five different nitrosamines 
were identified: N -nitrosodimethylamine 
(NDMA), N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA), 
N-nitrosodibutylamine, N-nitrosopiperidine, 
and N-nitrosomorpholine (NMor). Eighty 
samples, in which the concentrations were either 
zero or not quantifiable were excluded. NDMA 
was the most frequently encountered nitro -
samine (detected in 98% of the remaining 629 
samples) and represented the most important 
fraction of the total nitrosamine concentration. 
For all nitrosamines present, 141 of the concen -
trations measured exceeded 2.5 μg/m
3. The salt-
bath curing process generated particularly high 
nitrosamine levels, with 90% of the 96 meas -
urements showing concentrations higher than 
2.5 μg/m3, many values even exceeding 20 μg/m3 
(Oury et al., 1997 ).
Time trends of personal exposure to NDMA 
and to NMor over two decades (1980–2000) in the German rubber-manufacturing industry 
were analysed and compared with exposures 
observed in the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom over the same time 
period. A total of 2319 NDMA and 2316 NMor 
measurements contained in the EXASRUB database were analysed. Results from Germany 
accounted for 88% and 85% of the data for these 
two amines, respectively. For both NDMA and NMor, the average geometric mean concentra -
tion in Germany was 0.13 μg/m
3. Geometric 
mean concentrations of NDMA ranged from 
544Rubber-manufacturing industry
0.05 μg/m3 in the Netherlands to 0.34 μg/m3 
in Sweden, while those of NMor ranged from 
0.03 μg/m3 in the United Kingdom to 0.17 μg/m3 
in Poland and Sweden. Exposure to NDMA and NMor decreased on average 2–5-fold in the 
German rubber-manufacturing industry over this time period, mainly due to the introduction 
of modern curing systems. Comparable levels 
were observed in the other European countries (de V ocht et al., 2007 ).
In a study from Italy, personal expo -
sures to nine airborne N-nitrosamines 
(NDMA, NDEA, N -nitrosodi- n-propylamine, 
N-nitrosodiisopropylamine, N-nitrosodi-n-
butylamine, N-nitrosopiperidine, N-nitroso -
pyrrolidine, and NMor) were measured in 34 
workers from four Italian factories that manufac -
tured rubber drive belts for automobile engines. 
Airborne levels were very low and, in most 
cases, below the limit of detection of 0.06 μg/m3 
(Iavicoli & Carelli, 2006 )
Personal exposures to six nitrosamines 
(NDMA, NDEA, N -nitrosodi- n-butylamine, 
N-nitrosomorpholine, N-nitrosopiperidine, 
and N-nitrosopyrrolidine) were measured in 
the rubber-manufacturing industry in Sweden (Jönsson et al ., 2009 ). The exposures ranged 
from less than the limit of detection to 36 μg/m
3, 
and differed with the vulcanization method 
used. Workers involved in salt-bath vulcanizina -
tion had the highest level of exposure (median, 
4.2 μg/m3).
Although average levels of N -nitrosamines 
are nowadays well below the current exposure limits, exposure to these chemicals has not been eliminated and incidental high exposures do still 
occur.
1.3.4  PAHs
In a 1997 cross-sectional study of 116 Dutch 
male workers in the rubber-manufacturing industry, Peters et al . (2008)  collected urine 
samples on weekdays and on Sundays, and deter -
mined the concentration of 1-hydroxypyrene. The concentrations were significantly higher 
in workweek samples compared with those 
collected on Sunday. However, this increase 
was not uniform across tasks and only reached statistical significance for the curing department 
(P = 0.003).
1.3.5  Solvents
Kromhout et al . (1994)  measured exposures 
to solvents in 10 rubber-manufacturing plants in the Netherlands in the late 1980s. The extent 
of use of individual solvents varied widely and total solvent concentrations were reported. The 
quantitative assessment of exposure to solvents 
was restricted to paraffins (hexane, heptane and octane); aromatic compounds (toluene, 
xylene, trimethylbenzene, naphthalene and 
 isopropylbenzene); chlorinated hydrocarbons 
(trichloroethylene and 1,1,1-trichloroethane); 
ketones, alcohols and esters (methylisobutyl -
ketone, 2-ethoxyethanol and isobutylacetate). 
These were chosen on the basis of information on 
solvents, cements, and release and bonding agents 
used in the 10 plants. The geometric mean concen -
tration by plant varied from 0.5–46.9 mg/m
3 and 
ranged from 0.4–34.6 mg/m3 by department, 
with the highest exposures reported in the pre-
treating departments.
1.3.6  Phthalates
Two studies reported on exposure to phtha -
lates, which are used as plasticizers in the rubber-manufacturing industry. A total of 386 
spot-urine samples were collected from 101 Dutch workers employed in nine different factories, and 
analysed for the presence of phthalic acid and 
2-thiothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid. Samples were collected on Sunday and during the work -
week on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. Geometric mean concentrations of phthalic acid showed a significant 2-fold increase (paired 
t-test; P < 0.05) during the workweek compared 
with the concentrations measured on Sunday 
545IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
(GM, 83 μg/l), with absolute increases of approx -
imately 70 μg/l. The concentrations did not differ 
markedly between Tuesday, Wednesday and 
Thursday (GM, 148 μg/l, 152 μg/l and 164 μg/l, respectively). Increases seemed to be restricted 
to specific factories and/or departments (e.g. 
moulding and curing) ( Vermeulen et al., 2005 ).
In a pilot biomonitoring study in several 
industries, Hines et al . (2009)  reported that 
workers from a rubber boot manufacturing plant had 3-fold higher geometric mean concentra -
tions of diethylhexyl-phthalate metabolites in post-shift urine than the concentrations meas -
ured in the general population.
1.3.7  Dermal exposure
Kromhout et al . (1994)  and Vermeulen et 
al. (2000)  reported on dermal exposures to 
cyclohexane soluble compounds in the rubber-manufacturing industry in the Netherlands. Dermal CSF levels decreased in a similar pattern 
as inhalation exposures over a 9-year period 
(1988–1997).
2. Cancer in Humans
The literature reviewed in previous IARC 
Monographs  (IARC, 1982 , 1987 ) provided suffi-
cient evidence  of a causal association between 
exposures in the rubber-manufacturing industry and cancer. The recent Working Group decided 
to review evidence from individual studies that 
appeared after the earlier evaluation ( IARC, 1982 ) 
making use of a systematic review by Kogevinas 
et al . (1998) . Evidence from meta-analyses 
published by Stewart et al . (1999) , Borak et al . 
(2005)  and Alder et al . (2006)  was not consid -
ered since these studies combined a variety 
of exposure circumstances that would tend to dilute any observed effect. The Working Group 
realized that the complexity of occupational 
exposure in the rubber-manufacturing industry had so far precluded a clear conclusion about an association between increased cancer mortality and incidence and exposure to particular chemi -
cals (except historically well known associations between 2-naphthylamine and bladder cancer, and benzene and leukaemia). Future studies in the 
rubber-manufacturing industry may overcome 
this problem by making use more  systematically 
of the wealth of exposure data available in the 
industry ( de V ocht et al., 2005 , 2009 ).
2.1 Cancer of the bladder
In the previous IARC Monograph  (IARC, 
1982 ) it was concluded that there was sufficient 
evidence  of an excess occurrence of urinary 
bladder cancer in workers in the rubber-manu -
facturing industry. The first evidence appeared when a substantial excess of bladder cancer was 
noted among workers in this industry in the United Kingdom ( Case et al., 1954 ).
2.1.1  Cohort studies 
Among workers in the British rubber-manu -
facturing industry, the death rate from bladder 
cancer during 1936–1951 was almost twice that 
of the general population ( Case & Hosker, 1954 ). 
Studies in other countries also showed an excess 
of bladder cancer in workers in this industry, but 
these studies were based on small numbers.
Kogevinas et al . (1998)  conducted a 
 systematic review of epidemiological studies on 
cancer in the rubber-manufacturing industry. This review included cohort and case–control 
studies published after the previous evaluation 
(IARC, 1982 ), which were conducted in facilities 
that manufactured and repaired tyres, manufac -
tured cables and other rubber goods. The authors found that moderately increased risks for bladder cancer were reported in 6 of 8 cohort studies of 
workers employed in the rubber-manufacturing 
industry in different regions of the world. In four studies that reported results by calendar 
period, the risk was highest among workers 
employed before 1950 ( Delzell & Monson, 1984a , 
546Rubber-manufacturing industry
b, 1985a , b; Gustavsson et al. , 1986 ; Negri et al. , 
1989 ; Szeszenia-Dabrowska et al. , 1991 ). One of 
these studies reported potential co-exposure to 
2-naphthylamine ( Szeszenia-Dabrowska et al. , 
1991 ).
Two cohort studies of Polish workers published 
before 1998 were updated and an excess mortality risk for bladder cancer was reported (see Table 2.1, 
available at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/
Monographs/vol100F/100F-31-Table2.1.pdf ). In 
the most recent follow-up of a cohort of Polish 
workers involved in the manufacture of rubber 
footwear, non-statistically significant increased risks for bladder cancer were found among men 
and women ( Szymczak et al ., 2003 ). In a cohort 
study among workers in rubber-tyre manu -
facture in Poland ( Wilczyńska et al ., 2001 ), no 
increased risk for bladder cancer was observed 
among all workers, but analysis of a subcohort of men involved in mixing and weighing of raw 
materials, milling, extruding and calendaring, 
showed a non-significantly increased risk. A job-exposure matrix (JEM) for occupational expo -
sure to aromatic amines was used in the analysis of this cohort ( de V ocht et al ., 2009 ). This JEM 
was set-up with data from EXASRUB, which 
provided estimates of geometric mean concentra -
tions for airborne chemicals in each department 
in the factory during the study period. Internal 
analyses showed an increased risk in the highest 
two quartiles of exposure to aromatic amines.
2.1.2  Synthesis
Studies in the rubber-manufacturing industry 
with documented exposure to 2-naphthyl -
amine clearly show an increased risk of cancer of the urinary bladder. More recent studies that included workers with no recorded expo -
sure to 2-naphthylamine identified moderately increased risks for bladder cancer. [The Working Group could not rule out that the increased risks 
in recent studies were attributable to exposure to 2-naphthylamine, or whether other exposures in 
this industry contributed to this risk.]
2.2 Leukaemia
It was concluded in the previous IARC 
Monograph  (IARC, 1982 ) that there was sufficient 
evidence  of an excess occurrence of leukaemia in 
workers in the rubber-manufacturing industry.
2.2.1  Cohort studies
Kogevinas et al . (1998)  noted four cohort 
studies that found moderately increased risks 
for leukaemia among workers in the rubber-
manufacturing industry in the USA ( Norseth 
et al ., 1983 ; Delzell & Monson, 1984a , b, in two 
departments of a rubber plant in Akron, Ohio), in Italy ( Bernardinelli et al., 1987 ), and in Germany 
(Weiland et al., 1996 ), while four studies did not 
report an excess risk ( Gustavsson et al ., 1986 ; 
Negri et al ., 1989 ; Sorahan et al ., 1989 ; Carlo 
et al ., 1993 ). The magnitude of the risk varied 
between studies, with the highest risks found in studies conducted in North America. The results supported the conclusion that the excess 
risk for leukaemia was attributable to exposure 
to solvents, particularly benzene. The authors indicated that a variety of solvent mixtures, with 
or without benzene, had been used in rubber 
cements, glues, binding agents, and release agents.
Cohort studies on leukaemia that were 
published since the review paper mentioned above ( Kogevinas et al . (1998)  are summarized 
in Table  2.2 (available at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100F/100F-31-Table2.2.pdf ). Straif et al . (1998)  reported an 
excess risk for leukaemia in a cohort of male 
workers employed in one of five large plants in 
Germany that produced tyres or general rubber goods (SMR, 1.5; 95%CI: 1.0–2.1). An increased 
risk was observed in work area I (Preparation 
of Materials) where solutions were made up, 
547IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
and in work area II (Technical Rubber Goods). 
Non-significant excesses were also seen in other 
areas. Longer duration of employment was asso -
ciated with increased incidence of leukaemia in 
work area I, particularly among those workers 
with 10 or more years of employment (SMR, 3.0; 
95%CI: 1.5–5.6).
Li & Yu (2002a) conducted a nested case–
control study (7 cases of leukaemia, 28 controls) in a rubber-manufacturing facility, and reported an excess risk for leukaemia in workers of the 
inner-tube department, but not in other depart -
ments of the plant. The odds ratio for leukaemia 
was 7.81 (95%CI: 0.8–78.8) for one or more years 
of work in the inner-tube department.
2.2.2  Case–control study
McLean et al. (2009)  conducted a population-
based case–control study in New Zealand, with 225 cases of leukaemia and 471 controls. Full 
occupational histories were obtained by inter -
view. Among those reporting working as rubber/
plastics machine-operators (9 cases, 4 controls), 
the age-, sex- and smoking-adjusted risk estimate was 3.8 (95%CI: 1.1–13.1). The strongest findings, 
nonetheless, were for plastics rather than for the 
rubber-manufacturing industry.
2.2.3  Synthesis
The Working Group concluded that there 
was an increased risk for leukaemia among 
workers in the rubber-manufacturing industry. 
The excess risks may be associated with exposure to solvents, in particular benzene.
2.3 Malignant lymphoma including 
multiple myeloma and other 
lymphopoietic cancers
It was concluded in the previous review 
(IARC, 1982 ) that there was limited evidence  
of an excess occurrence of lymphoma among rubber-manufacturing workers. Excess occur -
rence of lymphoma had been noted in workers 
exposed to solvents in departments like footwear 
production and tyre manufacture ( Veys, 1982 ).
2.3.1  Cohort studies
Kogevinas et al . (1998)  reported excess risks 
for malignant lymphoma, including multiple 
myeloma, ranging from 1.7 to 3.6 in three 
cohort studies in the USA ( Norseth et al ., 1983 ; 
Delzell & Monson, 1984a , b, in a rubber plant 
in Akron, Ohio) and Italy ( Bernardinelli et al ., 
1987 ), while there was no excess risk in two other 
cohort studies, in Italy and the United Kingdom 
(Negri et al ., 1989 ; Sorahan et al ., 1989 ). Delzell 
& Monson (1984b, 1985b)  reported excess risks 
for multiple myeloma in certain departments of a rubber plant in Akron, Ohio, as did Gustavsson 
et al. (1986)  in Sweden.
Cohort studies published since 1998 are 
included in Table  2.2, on-line. In Germany, Mundt et al . (1999)  observed an increased risk 
for lymphatic system cancers among women 
employed in one of five large plants that produced 
tyres or general rubber goods. All cases were seen among women hired after 1950. In the 
United Kingdom, an increased mortality risk for 
multiple myeloma was found among men and women in 41 British rubber factories that manu -
factured tyres and general rubber goods ( Dost 
et al., 2007 ). Women also had increased multiple-
myeloma incidence (SRR, 8.1; 95%CI: 1.7–23.7). 
Excess mortality was observed among workers in 
the general rubber sector (seven deaths observed, one expected).
Wilczyńska et al . (2001) . did not find an 
overall increase in mortality risk for cancers of lymphatic and haematopoietic tissues in a 
rubber-tyre plant in Poland.
548Rubber-manufacturing industry
2.3.2  Synthesis
The Working Group concluded that there is 
sufficient evidence  of excess malignant lymphoma 
among workers in the rubber-manufacturing 
industry.
2.4 Cancer of the lung
In the previous IARC Monograph  (IARC, 
1982 ) it was concluded that there was suggestive 
evidence of an excess incidence of lung cancer among rubber-manufacturing workers, but that the evidence for a causal association with occu -
pational exposures was limited .
2.4.1  Cohort studies
Kogevinas et al . (1998)  noted that the more 
recently reviewed studies tended to confirm a 
moderate excess risk for lung cancer. Positive 
findings were reported in five cohort studies (Delzell & Monson, 1985a , in the curing depart -
ment; Gustavsson et al., 1986 ; Zhang et al., 1989 ; 
Szeszenia-Dabrowska et al ., 1991 ; Solionova & 
Smulevich, 1993 ). These risks were found among 
workers in tyre-curing departments, mixing and milling, in vulcanization workers, and in a study on jobs with high exposure to fumes or 
solvents. In three studies excess risks up to 1.5 
were reported ( Delzell & Monson, 1984b , in the 
aerospace-product department; Sorahan et al ., 
1989 ; Weiland et al ., 1996 ), while in five cohort 
studies excess risks were not found ( Norseth 
et al ., 1983 ; Delzell & Monson, 1984a , 1985b , in 
industrial-products and reclaim departments; Bernardinelli et al., 1987 ; Negri et al., 1989 ; Carlo 
et al., 1993 ).
Cohort studies on lung cancer published 
after the above-mentioned review ( Kogevinas 
et al ., 1998 ) are listed in Table  2.3 (available at 
http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100F/100F-31-Table2.3.pdf ). In most studies 
moderate but consistent increases in risk for lung cancer were found; two studies reported no increase in risk ( Dost et al ., 2007 ; deVocht et al. , 
2009).
From a study of a cohort of German women 
employed in rubber-manufacturing plants, 
Mundt et al . (1999)  reported an increased risk 
for lung cancer mortality. Stronger associations 
were observed for certain periods of employ -
ment. Among a cohort of German men, a signifi -
cantly increased risk for lung cancer mortality was observed ( Straif et al., 2000a ). Using internal 
comparisons, the authors showed increased risks among those employed during one year or more in work areas that involved preparation of mate -
rials, technical rubber goods and tyre produc -
tion ( Straif et al ., 1999 ). Through retrospective, 
semiquantitative estimates of exposures to 
 nitrosamines, asbestos and talc, an increased 
risk for lung cancer in association with high exposure levels for asbestos was observed. An 
exposure characterization in which categories 
of medium and high exposure levels of talc were combined with medium exposure to asbestos 
revealed an exposure-response relationship with 
lung-cancer incidence ( Straif et al., 2000a ).
Szymczak et al . (2003)  reported excess 
lung-cancer mortality among men and women employed in a rubber-footwear plant in Poland. There were increased risks by duration of employ -
ment, but no trend was observed. A population-based cohort study of non-smoking women in China also showed an increased risk for lung 
cancer, after controlling for exposure to second -
hand smoke, education level and family history 
of lung cancer ( Pronk et al., 2009 ). 
2.4.2  Case–control studies
The findings of population-based case–
control studies are listed in Table 2.4 (available 
at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/
vol100F/100F-31-Table2.4.pdf ). Most notably, in 
two large multicentre studies of non-smokers, increased risks for lung cancer were found among 
549IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
women who reported having been employed in 
the rubber-manufacturing industry ( Pohlabeln 
et al., 2000 ; Zeka et al., 2006 ).
2.4.3  Synthesis
Overall, the cohort studies suggest an 
increased lung-cancer risk among workers in 
the rubber-maufacturing industry. This conclu -
sion is supported by the findings of population-
based case–control studies. The Working Group 
concluded that there is evidence of excess lung 
cancer among workers in the rubber-manufac -
turing industry.
2.5 Cancer of the larynx
In a previous IARC Monograph  (IARC, 1987 ) 
it was indicated that cancer of the larynx had 
been reported as occurring in excess in workers 
in the rubber-manufacturing industry, but this excess was not consistent.
2.5.1  Cohort studies
In his review, Kogevinas et al. (1998)  reported 
a small but consistent excess risk for laryngeal 
cancer in seven cohorts, but indicated that the 
available evidence did not permit an evaluation to be made of the specific agents that may be 
associated with the increased risk for this cancer.
Straif et al. (2000a)  found increased mortality 
from laryngeal cancer among workers in the German rubber-manufacturing industry (see 
Table 2.3, on-line). The authors indicated that the excess risk may be associated with employment 
in weighing and mixing and with exposure to 
asbestos, talc or carbon black. Dost et al.  (2007) 
did not find an increased risk for laryngeal 
cancer mortality and incidence among workers 
in the British rubber-manufacturing industry. De Vocht et al . (2009)  did not find increased 
mortality from laryngeal cancer in a plant that manufactured rubber tyres. They also did not find an association with exposure to aromatic amines or inhalable aerosol.
2.5.2  Synthesis
The Working Group concluded that there was 
inconsistent evidence of excess laryngeal cancer 
among workers in the rubber-manufacturing 
industry. [Tobacco smoking is a risk factor for laryngeal cancer, yet in many studies no adjust -
ment for smoking status was made.]
2.6 Cancer of the stomach
In the previous IARC Monograph  (IARC, 
1982 ) it was concluded that there was sufficient 
evidence  of an excess of stomach cancer among 
workers in the rubber-manufacturing industry, and limited evidence of a causal association with 
occupational exposures. 
2.6.1  Cohort studies
The conclusions of the previous Working 
Group ( IARC, 1982 ) were supported by cohort 
studies of male workers in specific rubber facto -
ries. A study in a rubber plant in Akron, Ohio 
(USA) showed an excess of stomach cancer 
primarily among workers involved in jobs early 
in the production line, where exposures are mainly to particulate matter, but also to some 
fume from uncured rubber ( Delzell & Monson, 
1982 ). A case–control analysis of stomach cancer 
among male workers in the same plant showed a positive association with work early in the 
production line and with jobs in curing and maintenance ( McMichael et al ., 1976 ). Further 
analysis, according to estimated exposure to 
specific agents, showed a positive association 
with exposure to talc ( Blum et al ., 1979 ). In 
one study in the United Kingdom, mortality 
from stomach cancer was increased among all 
workers, but particularly among men in jobs early in the production process ( Parkes et al ., 
1982 ). In a second study in the United Kingdom, 
550Rubber-manufacturing industry
excess mortality from stomach cancer was also 
observed among all workers, but not among 
particular occupations ( Baxter & Werner, 1980 ).
Kogevinas et al . (1998)  reported low excess 
risks for stomach cancer in seven cohort studies. The risk was elevated mainly in mixing and 
milling departments in two studies ( Wang et al., 
1984 ; Gustavsson et al ., 1986 ) and in jobs with 
high exposure to dust in a third study ( Sorahan 
et al ., 1989 ). Kogevinas et al . (1998)  indicated 
that cohort studies published after 1982 either 
did not confirm the presence of an excess risk or 
suggested the presence of only a slightly elevated risk.
Cohort studies on stomach cancer published 
since the above-mentioned review are listed in Table  2.5 (available at http://monographs.
iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100F/100F-31-
Table2.5.pdf ). In case–cohort study in China 
of workers in a rubber-manufacturing plant, 
Li & Yu (2002b) reported an increased risk 
for stomach cancer. Increased risks were also reported by duration of work in inner tyre-tube 
manufacturing and milling departments. Mundt 
et al. (1999)  found excess risks for stomach cancer 
among German women employed in the rubber-
manufacturing industry, which was stronger 
among workers hired after 1960.
Straif et al . (2000a)  reported a moderately 
increased risk for stomach cancer among male workers in the German rubber-manufacturing industry. An exposure-effect association with 
talc was observed, but no association with nitros -
amines. Data appeared to indicate an association 
with carbon black, but after adjustment for talc- 
and asbestos-containing dusts, the risk estimate 
was lower and no longer significant.
On the basis of internal comparisons, Neves 
et al. (2006)  found an increasing risk for stomach 
cancer among workers in the rubber-manufac -
turing industry employed in small companies 
in comparison with workers at large companies, 
with 10-year lagging and control for confounding (RR, 3.47; 95%CI: 2.57–4.67). Company size was used as a surrogate of probability of exposure to carcinogenic substances. De Vocht et al . (2009)  
found a moderate excess risk for stomach cancer, particularly among workers in the maintenance department of a tyre-manufacturing plant, while 
Dost et al . (2007)  showed a modest excess of 
stomach-cancer incidence among male workers 
in a study of British rubber plants.
2.6.2  Synthesis
The Working Group concluded that there was 
evidence of an excess of stomach cancer among 
rubber-manufacturing workers.
2.7 Cancer of the oesophagus
The previous IARC Monograph  (IARC, 1982 ) 
determined that there was inadequate evidence  
for excess occurrence of cancer of the oesophagus 
among workers in the rubber-manufacturing industry.
2.7.1  Cohort studies
Kogevinas et al. (1998)  reported an increased 
risk for oesophageal cancer in four cohorts 
(Delzell & Monson, 1985b , in reclaim-depart -
ment workers; Sorahan et al ., 1989 ; Szeszenia-
Dabrowska et al ., 1991 , Weiland et al ., 1996 ). 
Other cohorts studies showed no effect.
Straif et al . (2000b)  reported a signifi -
cantly increasing trend for oesophageal cancer with increasing exposure to nitrosamines (see 
Table 2.5, on-line). Tests for trend and associa -
tions were also significant for cancers of the lip 
and oral cavity. In Poland, Szymczak et al. (2003)  
reported a significant excess risk among rubber-
footwear workers.
2.7.2  Synthesis
The Working Group concluded that there 
was some evidence for an excess risk for cancer 
of the oesophagus among workers in the 
551IARC MONOGRAPHS – 100F
rubber-manufacturing industry. [The Working 
Group noted that in none of the studies adjust -
ments were made for tobacco or alcohol use.]
2.8 Cancer of the prostate
The previous IARC Monograph  (IARC, 1982 ) 
concluded that the evidence of excess risk for 
prostate cancer was limited  and that the evidence 
for a causal association with occupational expo -
sures was inadequate.
2.8.1  Cohort studies
Kogevinas et al . (1998)  reported excess risks 
for prostate cancer in five studies ( Norseth et al., 
1983 ; Delzell & Monson 1984a , in the indus -
trial-products department; Bernardinelli et al ., 
1987 ; Solionova & Smulevich, 1993 ; Weiland 
et al ., 1996 ). Other studies did not report any 
excess ( Delzell & Monson, 1984b , 1985b ; in the 
aerospace-products and re-claim departments; Gustavsson et al ., 1986 ; Sorahan et al ., 1989 ; 
Szeszenia-Dabrowska et al., 1991 ).
Since then, only one case–cohort study that 
investigated the association between prostate 
cancer and work in the rubber-manufacturing industry has been published ( Zeegers et al ., 
2004 ). In this study a non-statistically significant 
increased risk for prostate cancer was found.
2.8.2  Synthesis
The Working Group concluded that there is 
weak evidence of excess risk for prostate cancer 
among workers in the rubber-manufacturing 
industry.
2.9 Other cancers
The previous IARC Monograph  (IARC, 1982 ) 
determined that for cancers of the brain, thyroid 
and pancreas, the evidence was inadequate  for an 
excess in occurrence of these cancers and for a 
causal association with occupational exposures.2.9.1  Cohort studies
Kogevinas et al . (1998)  reported that find -
ings for other cancer sites were not consistent 
between studies, or were derived from too few 
studies. Since this review, studies on workers in the rubber-manufacturing industry with excess 
cancers of the brain, pancreas, gallbladder, 
cervix and liver have been reported (see Table 2.6 available at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/
Monographs/vol100F/100F-31-Table2.6.pdf ). 
2.9.2  Synthesis
The Working Group concluded that there is 
little evidence of excess risks for cancers at sites other than those mentioned above, being asso -
ciated with work in the rubber-manufacturing 
industry. [Excess risks found in single studies 
may be related to specific exposure circumstances 
occurring in particular rubber-manufacturing 
plants. One problem in evaluating findings for 
other cancer sites is that reporting may have been incomplete in cohort and case–control studies, 
with possibly preferential reporting of positive 
findings.]
3. Cancer in Experimental Animals
No data were available to the Working Group.
4. Other Relevant Data
The rubber-manufacturing industry has 
used and still uses a wide variety of substances 
that belong to many different chemical catego -
ries, e.g. carbon black, aromatic amines, PAH, N-nitrosamines, mineral oils, other volatile 
organic compounds from curing fumes, trace 
amounts of monomers from synthetic rubber like 
1,3-butadiene, acetonitrile, styrene, vinyl chlo -
ride, ethylene oxide, etc. (See Section 1). For this 
reason, it has been difficult to relate the observed

cancer hazards in the rubber-manufacturing 
industry to exposure to specific chemicals.
Table 4.1  presents a list of bio-monitoring 
studies and cytogenetic assays among workers in the rubber-manufacturing industry in various 
countries and at different times. These studies 
have focused on analysis of chromosomal aberra -
tions, sister-chromatid exchange, micronucleus 
formation, premature chromosome condensa -
tion, DNA breakage, DNA-adduct formation, 
mutagenicity in urine, and mutation in the HPRT  
gene. For each of these endpoints, in most studies a positive response has been observed in exposed workers compared with non-exposed controls. It 
is noted that the studies listed in Table 4.1  span a 
period of approximately 25 years.
The multiple genetic and cytogenetic effects 
observed among workers employed in the rubber-
manufacturing industry provide strong evidence to support genotoxicity as one mechanism for 
the observed increase in cancer risk. However, 
due to the complexity and changing nature of the exposure mixture and the potential interac -
tions between exposures in this industry, other mechanisms are also likely to play a role.
While it is clear that exposures to some agents 
in the rubber-manufacturing industry have been reduced over time, the outcome of recent cytoge -
netic studies continues to raise concerns about 
cancer risks.
5. Evaluation
There is sufficient evidence  in humans for the 
carcinogenicity of occupational exposures in the rubber-manufacturing industry. Occupational 
exposures in the rubber-manufacturing industry 
cause leukaemia, lymphoma, and cancers of the 
urinary bladder, lung, and stomach.
lso, a positive association has been observed 
between occupational exposures in the rubber-manufacturing industry and cancers of the pros -
tate, oesophagus, and larynx.No data in experimental animals with rele -
vance to the rubber-manufacturing industry were available to the Working Group.
The multiple genetic and cytogenetic effects 
observed among workers employed in the rubber-manufacturing industry provide strong evidence to support genotoxicity as one mechanism for 
the observed increase in cancer risks. However, 
due to the complexity and changing nature of the exposure mixture and the potential interactions 
between exposures in the rubber-manufacturing 
industry, other mechanisms are also likely to play a role. While it is clear that exposure to some 
agents in the rubber-manufacturing industry 
has been reduced over time, the results of recent cytogenetic studies continue to raise concerns 
about cancer risks.
Occupational exposures in the rubber-manu -
facturing industry are carcinogenic to humans 
(Group 1) .
