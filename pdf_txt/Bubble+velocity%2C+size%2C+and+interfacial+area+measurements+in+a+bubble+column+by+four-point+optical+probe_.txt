The four-point optical probe is applied in a bubble column with an air–water system
to investigate the bubble properties (local gas holdup, velocity, chord length, speciﬁcinterfacial area, and frequency) over a range of gas superﬁcial velocities. Both bubblesmoving upward and downward are recorded and measured as opposed to only upwardbubbles measured and reported in other studies involving probes. The probe workedefﬁciently in both bubbly ﬂow and highly churn-turbulent ﬂow at very high superﬁcialgas velocities. Bubble properties at the conditions of churn-turbulent ﬂow are obtainedand investigated for the ﬁrst time. The changes in the bubble velocity distribution, bub-
ble chord length distribution, and speciﬁc interfacial area with superﬁcial gas velocity,
sparger design, and with axial and radial positions in the column are discussed.

Introduction
The knowledge of bubble properties, including bubble ve-
locity, bubble size, gas holdup, and speciﬁc interfacial area,is of considerable importance for the proper design and oper-
ation of bubble columns. For example, bubble properties
play key roles in determining the heat and mass transfer ratein bubble columns. Furthermore, bubble size distribution and
bubble velocity distribution are key parameters in evaluating
the drag forces on bubbles and in using the bubble popula-tion balance in computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD). How-
ever, because of the limitations of the commonly available
measurement technique, important bubble properties in 3Dbubble columns are scarce in the literature, especially in
churn-turbulent ﬂow, and the available data are often notreliable.
1After validation of the measurements obtained by
the four-point optical probe with digital camera in 2D cali-bration systems,
2the probe was utilized over a range of oper-
ating conditions in a cylindrical bubble column, 6.4 in. (16.2
cm) in diameter, to determine the bubble velocity distribu-tion, bubble chord length (the length of the chord that the
probe tip passed by in the bubble) distribution, local gas
holdup, and speciﬁc interfacial area. The operating conditionswere the same as those used for the cray computed tomogra-
phy (CT) and computer automated radioactive particle track-
ing (CARPT) experiments conducted by Ong.
3At the operat-
ing conditions used (superﬁcial gas velocity from 2 to
60 cm/s, pressure from 0.1 to 1.0 MPa), the two-phase ﬂow
in the bubble column changes from bubbly ﬂow to highlychurn-turbulent ﬂow. Bubble properties, such as chord lengthdistribution and velocity distribution locally at various posi-
tions in the column, at the conditions of higher gas superﬁ-
cial velocities were measured for the ﬁrst time, and presentnew data needed for CFD validation and engineering modelCorrespondence concerning this article should be addressed to M. P. Dudukovic

bles have been measured for the ﬁrst time instead of onlymeasuring upward bubbles as reported in previous studies
using probes. Furthermore, the proﬁle of the speciﬁc interfa-
cial area as a function of column radial position at differentaxial elevations has been measured by the four-point opticalprobe readily and reliably.
Experimental Setup
The conﬁguration of the four-point optical probe, which
was made in-house, was shown in Figure 1. Three of the
four tips of the probe are of the same length and form an
equilateral triangle. The fourth, central tip is positionedthrough the inertial center of this triangle, and is about
2.0 mm longer than the others. The radial distance from the
central ﬁber to each of the others that surround it is about0.6 mm. Hence, the diameter of the four-point probe is about1.2 mm. The tip of the glass ﬁbers is shaped into a cone or
semisphere. This shape assures that most light is reﬂected at
the ﬁber tip when the probe is in gas phase and is scatteredat the probe tip when it is in the liquid phase, due to the dif-
ference in the refractive index between the glass, the liquid
phase, and the gas phase. By transferring the reﬂected lightinto voltage, the probe can generate a response (as shown in
Figure 2) to each bubble that hits the probe tip. Then the
bubble properties (local gas holdup, velocity, chord length,speciﬁc interfacial area, and frequency) can be derived byprocessing the response with an appropriate algorithm. The
bubble properties by the four-point probe have been validated
against imaging method in a 2D transparent bubble column.More details about the probe can be found in the preceding
paper
1and in the thesis of Xue.2
The conﬁguration of the 16.2-cm (6.4 in.) diameter stain-
less steel bubble column is shown in Figure 3. In this ﬁgure
also the four-point probe locations at which measurements
were made are schematically presented. The setup was oper-ated in the batch mode regarding the liquid, with tap water
as the liquid phase. For the gas phase, ﬁltered, dry com-
pressed air was used.
The four-point probe measurements were conducted at dif-
ferent gas velocities and pressures. The operating conditions
employed are listed in Table 1. Three axial measuring posi-
tions, that is, z/D51.7, 5.1, and 8.5, and seven radial posi-
tions, that is, r/R56 0.9,r/R56 0.6,r/R56 0.3, and r/R
50 were used, where positive and negative values of r/Rrepresent different locations along the diameter of the col-
umn (Figure 3). The optical probe must employ the ﬁxedports available on the column wall. Because of this physical
limitation of the column, that is, the ports are all located on
the same vertical plane (Figure 3), the radial measuring posi-tions at each axial position are along one column diameter
and all the measuring positions were in one single vertical
plane in the column (i.e., the full azimuthal dependence wasnot investigated). The conﬁguration of the spargers used isshown in Figure 4 and Table 2.
The operating principle of the four-point probe
1,2ensures
that it accurately measures bubbles moving upward when itis positioned with tube tips facing downward. To capture
downward moving bubbles, the probe is positioned with the
tips facing upward. Visual observations indicate that, at highgas superﬁcial velocity, many bubbles move downward in
bubble columns in transition ﬂow and churn-turbulent ﬂow,
especially in the wall zone. Hence, the four-point probe waspositioned in two directions at each measuring site, that is,
upward and downward, and in both cases the probe tip was
positioned at the same point (Figure 3). In this way, bothbubbles moving upward and those moving downward can bemeasured, instead of only bubbles moving upward as usually
done in other reported studies involving probes.
Results and Discussion
The effect of superﬁcial gas velocity on
bubble properties
The superﬁcial gas velocity, Ug, is one of the key operat-
ing variables that affect the hydrodynamics in bubble col-umns, including bubble properties. Figure 5a shows, for
Sparger 2, the radial proﬁles of the local gas holdup, e
g,l,a t
different Ugand the changes of eg,lwith Ugat different radial
positions. The error bars, which come from the standard
deviation of replicated measurements, are also displayed. It
is clear from Figure 5a that at Ug52 cm/s, which is bubbly
ﬂow, the radial proﬁle of the local gas holdup is ﬂat (only in
the core ﬂow, that is, r/Rfrom20.9 to 0.9, not include the
very near wall zone, this also applies to the following discus-sion). The local gas holdup proﬁle is parabolic in shapewhen U
gis larger than 8 cm/s, when the ﬂow changes from
transition ﬂow to churn-turbulent ﬂow. Furthermore, the

higher the gas velocity, the steeper the parabolic-like gas
holdup radial proﬁle. These observations are corroborated
with the CT experimental results.3,4It is also noted that the
measured bubble properties are not strictly symmetric in the
horizontal direction in the plane of measurement. Visual ob-
servation through the windows on the column wall is also in-dicative of the asymmetry of the ﬂow in the column. Possible
causes for this asymmetry include the possibility that the
bubble column is not vertical (which is not true in this studybecause the column was adjusted to be vertical by hanginghammer), that the sparger used is not axially symmetric, and
that the coherent structure in the ﬂow is nonsymmetric.
5One
should note that while we talk about radial proﬁles in thismanuscript, these are not azimuthally averaged values as we
normally report from our tomography measurements, but val-
ues obtained in a single vertical plane that passes through thecentral axis of the column. Whether azimuthal averaging
would make these proﬁles seem more symmetric is not
known since such measurements, due to the previouslyexplained limitations of the column, were not made in this
study.
It is found that the radial proﬁles of both speciﬁc interfa-
cial area (Figure 5b) and bubble frequency (the number of
bubbles that hit the central tip of the probe per second) and
their changes with U
gare similar to the radial proﬁle of the
local gas holdup. The similarity between these proﬁles is theresult of the fact that local gas holdup, speciﬁc interfacial
area, and bubble frequency are strongly correlated. Speaking
generally, an increase in bubble frequency leads to anincrease in gas holdup and speciﬁc interfacial area.

increased with Ugin the core of the column, and the rate of
increase in vbwith Ugin the bubbly ﬂow regime was faster
than in the churn-turbulent ﬂow regime. In the wall zone ( r/
R56 0.9), vbwas positive in bubbly ﬂow ( Ug52c m / s )
and was small or even negative at Ug[8 cm/s. Above Ug
of 14 cm/s, the magnitude of vbincreased slowly with Ug.
In the range of Uginvestigated ( Ug52–60 cm/s), the mini-
mum vbwas detected in the wall zone at Ug58c m / s ,i n
the transition regime from bubbly ﬂow to churn-turbulentﬂow.The bubble velocity distribution in the wall zone (Figure
7,r/R56 0.9,z/D55.1) obtained by the four-point optical
probe clariﬁes the observed behavior of the mean bubble ve-
locity,
vb. It should be noted that a large portion of bubbles
of very low velocity can not be measured by the probe.This is because it takes a relatively long time for very slow
bubbles to pass through the four tips of the probe. During
this time interval, if the ﬂow ﬁeld around the bubblechanges, the bubble velocity also changes during its passageby the probe since bubbles move with the liquid ﬂow. In
this case, the velocity of the bubble determined by the four-
point probe is the mean of the early slow velocity and thelater high velocity. Hence, the four-point probe tends to
underestimate the probability of bubbles of very low veloc-
ity. However, it should be noted that this bias is usually notsigniﬁcant because the vertical distance between the central
tip and the other tips of the probe is about 2 mm. Hence,
for assumption, if the time scale of the ﬂow ﬁeld change is0.1 s, then only bubbles with velocity lower than about 2
cm/s will be affected. It should be noted that any measure-
ment technique that uses ‘‘time of ﬂight’’ has a bias formeasuring velocities close to zero in a ﬂuctuating ﬂow.Usually the percentage of bubbles with such low velocity
for which the bias affects the results is small but not
always. The bias happens both for bubbles moving upwardand downward, and hence, the mean bubble velocity is not
affected much by this bias.
AtU
g52 cm/s, all bubbles move upward (Figure 7a),
and the peak in the bubble velocity distribution is thin and
sharp. At Ug[8 cm/s, the bubble velocity distributions at r/
R52 0.9 and r/R50.9 are different. At r/R52 0.9, more
bubbles move downward than upward while at r/R50.9,
almost as many bubbles move upward as downward. As a
result, the radial proﬁle of vbis not symmetric at z/D55.1
and vbatr/R52 0.9 is smaller than that at r/R50.9
(Figure 6a). When Ugincreased from 8 to 14 cm/s (i.e., in
the transition ﬂow regime), the mean velocity of bubbles
moving upward increases greatly (from 9.45 to 20.9 cm/s atr/R52 0.9 and 12.4 to 28.3 cm/s at r/R50.9) whereas that
of bubbles moving downward increases mildly in magnitude
(from233.8 to 239.1 cm/s at r/R52 0.9 and 228.2 to
234.6 cm/s at r/R50.9). This is because large bubbles,Table 1. Column Dimensions and Selected

which have high velocity, arose in the transition ﬂow regime
and assembled in the central stream of the column (this is
evident from an increase in the number of bubbles of high
velocity in the bubble velocity distributions at Ug58 and
14 cm/s, Figures 8b, c). The velocity of bubbles moving
downward in the wall zone increased mainly due to the
enhancement of the liquid recirculation. Hence, the velocityof bubbles moving upward jumped and of bubbles movingdownward increases only mildly in the transition ﬂow re-
gime. In churn-turbulent ﬂow, at U
g[14 cm/s, the percent-
age of bubbles moving downward in the wall zone increasedslowly with U
g.
The bubble velocity distributions in the center of the bub-
ble column ( r/R50,z/D55.1) at different Ugare shown
in Figure 8. In contrast to the bubble velocity distribution in
the wall zone, most bubbles move upward in the column cen-
ter. The percentage of bubbles moving downward increasedwith U
g, but even at very high gas velocity, for example, Ug
560 cm/s, only a small percentage of bubbles moved down-
ward in the column center. Bubbles moving downward in thecolumn center include small bubbles that exist in the wakesof large bubbles. This may be due to the chaotic nature of
the ﬂow in bubble column where the ﬂow reversal occurs
even in churn-turbulent ﬂow, dragging bubbles downward. Inchurn-turbulent ﬂow, the number of large bubbles increases
with U
gand liquid recirculation is enhanced.3Hence, there
are more bubbles moving downward being detected by thefour-point probe. The bubble velocity distribution in the col-umn center spreads more widely with increased U
g, and the
magnitude of the mean velocity of bubbles moving upwardis much larger than that of bubbles moving downward.
The bubble chord length distributions obtained by the
four-point optical probe at different gas velocities in thewall zone at r/R52 0.9 (the shape of bubble chord length
distributions at r/R50.9 are similar to that at r/R52 0.9)
and in the center of the column ( r/R50) are displayed in
Figure 9. At the column center ( r/R50), the number of
bubbles used for the calculation of the bubble chord length
distribution is over 10,000 at U
g/C218 cm/s and about 4000
atUg52 cm/s. In the wall region ( r/R52 0.9), the num-
ber is over 5000 and about 4000 at the above two gas su-
perﬁcial velocities, respectively. The large number of bub-
bles for the derivation of the bubble chord length distribu-tion and mean bubble chord length ensures statistically
representative results. It can be seen that in the column cen-
ter the probability of both small and large chord lengthsincreases with increased U
g, and the spread of the bubble
chord length distribution is wide r (Figure 9a). Note that at
Ug58 cm/s the median of the pdf seems to be located at
the highest chord length. In the wall zone (Figure 9b), theshape of the bubble chord length distribution does not
change much with U
gwhen Ug/C218 cm/s. The probability
of small bubble chord length increases with Ug,w h i l et h a t
of large bubble chord length does not change much with
Ug. This may be because large bubbles pass through the
bubble column in the central bubble stream, as described byChen et al.,
7and seldom move into the wall zone, while
small bubbles tend to enter the wall zone and move with
the downward liquid ﬂow.
The mean bubble chord length and the standard deviation
of the bubble chord length distributions are plotted in Fig-
ure 10. The error bar for the mean bubble chord length is
also shown. It can be seen that the mean and standard devia-tion of the bubble chord length distribution in the column
center are almost identical to those in the wall zone at U

exist, and at Ug58 cm/s, where the liquid recirculation is
present, however, the number of large bubbles in the centralstream is still small. This is in agreement with the ﬁndings
of Mudde et al.
8and of Mudde and Saito9who reported sig-
niﬁcant liquid circulation for the range of Ug;2 to 6 cm/s.
When Ug/C2114 cm/s, the mean and standard deviation of the
bubble chord length distribution in the column center are
much larger than those in the wall zone due to the assemblyof large bubbles in the central bubble stream. In the column
center, the mean bubble chord length increases with U
gwhen Ug
/C2030 cm/s and decreases slightly with Ugwhen Ug/C2130 cm/s(Figure 10a); the standard deviation increases quickly
between Ug58 cm/s and Ug530 cm/s and decreases
slightly with Ugwhen Ug/C2130 cm/s. This is because in the
transition ﬂow regime and churn-turbulent ﬂow regime, bub-
bles break and coalesce, and the number of both large andsmall bubbles increases and the bubble size distribution
spreads wider than the relatively uniform bubble size distri-
bution in bubbly ﬂow. In the churn-turbulent ﬂow regime,the increase in the number of small bubbles is faster than
that of large bubbles, and hence, the mean bubble chord
length decreases slightly with U
g. In the wall zone, the mean

bubble chord length increases with Ugwhen Ug/C208 cm/s
and decreases somewhat with Ugwhen Ug/C218 cm/s. The
standard deviation keeps increasing with Ugin the range Ug
52–60 cm/s, but the rate of increase is much slower than
that in the column center. This is also the consequence of
the fact that the large bubbles gather in the column center,and mainly small bubbles exist in the wall zone of thecolumn.
Figure 11 shows the bubble velocity distribution and bub-
ble chord length distribution at radial position r/R50,
20.3,20.6, and 20.9. Because of the observation that the
shape of the distributions at symmetric radial positions, for
example, r/R50.3 and r/R52 0.3, are approximate toeach other, the following discussions are valid for both sides
in the column. It can be seen from Figure 11a that the per-centage of bubbles moving downward increases from the col-
umn center to the wall zone; in the core of the column the
change is slow, and bubbles moving upward are in the ma-jority, whereas in the wall zone bubbles moving downward
predominate. Since bubbles move with the liquid ﬂow, this
phenomenon is corroborated by research ﬁndings on liquidrecirculation in bubble columns, which shows that the transi-tion from upﬂow to downﬂow for the liquid recirculation
happens at r/R50.6–0.7.
3As shown in Figure 11b, the bub-
ble chord length distributions in the core of the column arealike in shape. A sudden change happens within the wall
zone where the percentage of small bubble chord lengths

increases greatly because mainly small bubbles exist in the
wall zone of the column. Hence, it can be concluded that in
churn-turbulent ﬂow in the core of the column ( r/R\0.6 in
this study) the shape of the bubble velocity and bubble chordlength distributions are alike, while in the wall zone they are
very different from those in the core of the column.
Figure 12 shows the relationship between the bubble ve-
locity and the bubble chord length in the center of the col-
umn at different U
g. It should be noted that the bubble veloc-
ity is the sum of the liquid velocity and the bubble’s slip ve-locity since bubbles move with the liquid ﬂow in bubblecolumns. In other words, bubble size is not the only factor
that affects the bubble velocity. In churn-turbulent ﬂow, it is
not even the decisive factor. Therefore, the bubble velocityincreases with bubble size and it is much higher in churn-tur-
bulent ﬂow than in bubbly ﬂow. It is noteworthy that we
measured chord length, not bubble size, and the relationshipbetween bubble velocity and chord length could be more
complex than that between bubble velocity and size. It is evi-
dent that in churn-turbulent ﬂow, the velocity of a portion of
small chord length bubbles is as high as that for large bub-bles (Figure 12d). This implies that the high velocity at small
chord lengths is not necessarily due to small bubbles, but
may be caused by large bubbles pierced at the side. In addi-tion, many small bubbles exist in the wake of large bubbles
and they move with the large bubbles. In a few cases, large
bubbles have relatively low velocity. One possible reason isthat large bubbles tend to vibrate seriously during movement,and if the probe hits the part of a large bubble that is vibrat-
ing in the opposite direction to the bubble velocity vector,
then the velocity detected by the probe will be much lowerthan the real velocity of the bubble. Besides, the ﬂow ﬁeld in
bubble columns is very complicated and it can affect the
bubble velocity signiﬁcantly. For example, a down ﬂow liq-

uid stream can temporarily decrease the velocity of some
large bubbles. If such liquid down draft occurs locally at thetime of large bubble arrival at the probe top, the bubble ve-
locity lower than expected based on its chord length will be
detected.The effect of spargers
It has been reported that the conﬁguration of the sparger,
for example, the number and size of the oriﬁces, affects the
generation of bubbles and subsequently may affect the hydro-dynamics in bubble columns.
10–12As shown in Figure 4 and
detailed in Table 2, three spargers were used in this study: a
cross sparger (Sparger No. 1), a perforated plate with 0.15%open area (Sparger No. 2), and a perforated plate with 1.0%open area (Sparger No. 3).
It was found that, in the sparger zone ( z/D51.7), at ﬁxed
superﬁcial gas velocity the bubble frequency increased in theorder of Sparger No. 1, Sparger No. 3, and Sparger No. 2, as
shown in Figure 13. Sparger No. 1 and No. 3, which are
totally different in their hole numbers, hole sizes, and holedistributions, generate bubbles of relatively similar proper-
ties, for example, bubble frequency.
Figure 14 shows the bubble chord length distributions in the
column center in the sparger zone ( z/D51.7) for the three
spargers. The distributions for Sparger No. 1 and No. 3 are
again alike except for the fact that Sparger No. 3 produced an
additional peak at small values of bubble chord length. Thebubble chord length distribution for Sparger No. 2 has a higher
probability density at small values of chord length. The mean
bubble chord length and standard deviation of the bubble

chord length distributions decreases in the order of Sparger
No. 1, Sparger No. 3, and Sparger No. 2 (Figure 14b). Conse-
quently, the local gas holdup at z/D51.7 increases in the
same order, that is, Sparger No. 2 produced the highest local
gas holdup and Sparger No. 1 and No. 3 gave almost the same
gas holdup, as shown in Figure 14c.
Some correlations have been developed for the estimation
of the initial bubble size at the sparger.13–15The estimated
initial bubble sizes based on these predictions are listed inTable 3.3Obviously, the initial bubble size by the prediction
of Ellenberger and Krishna13is too large. The initial bubble
sizes predicted by Leibson et al.14and Wallis15are of the
same order of magnitude as the mean bubble chord length
obtained by the four-point probe. Although the bubble size
increases with axial position in the sparger zone due to bub-ble coalescence so that the bubble size at the measuring posi-tion of the probe ( z/D51.7) is larger than at the sparger,

Sparger No. 2 and No. 3 still seems to be too small. Further-
more, the initial bubble size increases in the order of SpargerNo. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 according to the prediction of Leib-
son et al.,
14whereas the mean bubble chord length obtained
by the probe ( r/R50) increases in the order of Sparger No.
2, No. 3, and No. 1. Hence, the initial bubble size estimated
by these predictions does not ﬁt the experimental results in
this study very well.
The bubble velocity distributions in the sparger zone for
different spargers are shown in Figure 15. It was found that
Sparger No. 1 and No. 3 generated approximately the same
bubble velocity distribution at different radial positions in thesparger zone (Figures 15a–c). Sparger No. 2 generated more
bubbles moving downward in the wall zone, especially at r/R
52 0.9 (Figure 15b). This is also clear from the radial pro-
ﬁles of the mean bubble velocity for different spargers
(Figure 15d), where it can be seen that, for the three spargers
used, the mean bubble velocity for sparger No. 2 is thesmallest in the wall zone.

Sparger No. 2 also produced a higher speciﬁc interfacial
area in the sparger zone than the other two spargers, asshown in Figure 16. This is in agreement with the radial pro-
ﬁles of the local gas holdup (Figure 14c) and bubble
frequency (Figure 13), due to the correlation of these threevariables.
Earlier by cray CT and CARPT experiments, Ong
3found
that deep in the churn-turbulent ﬂow regime ( Ug/C2130 cm/s)
at atmospheric pressure the effect of the sparger on the radialgas holdup proﬁle and liquid recirculation in the fully devel-
oped region ( z/D/C215.5) is minor. The sparger effect on bub-
ble properties in the fully developed region obtained by thefour-point probe is shown in Figure 17. It can be seen that at
atmospheric pressure, the sparger effect on the radial proﬁle
of gas holdup, bubble frequency, mean bubble velocity, andspeciﬁc interfacial area is small at z/D55.1. The exception
is noted in the wall zone for mean bubble velocity and may
be caused by the existence of coherent structures,
5which
makes the ﬂow ﬁeld in the wall zone asymmetric and causes
frequent changes in the ﬂow direction. In other words, the ra-
dial proﬁles of the bubble frequency, the mean bubble veloc-ity, and the speciﬁc interfacial area for the three spargers fol-low the same trend as the gas holdup proﬁles. Hence, the
sparger effect disappeared with an increase in the axial posi-
tion in the bubble column, and it was not signiﬁcant at z/D
[5.1 in this study.
The effect of axial position on bubble properties
For the operating conditions employed in this study, the
mean bubble velocity proﬁle did not change much with axialposition, except at low gas velocity ( U
g52 cm/s, shown in
Figure 18). At Ug52 cm/s, the mean bubble velocity in the
lower zone of the bubble column ( z/D51.7) was higher
than that in the upper zone. This is possibly due to the largeinitial momentum of the bubbles jetting from the sparger and
the lack of liquid recirculation at low gas velocity. This was
not true when U
g/C218 cm/s, that is, in the transition and
churn-turbulent region, where the mean bubble velocity in
the core of the column did not change much with axial posi-
tion. This means that in the transition and churn-turbulent re-gime the mean bubble velocity proﬁle developed very fast in
the axial direction; in other words, the sparger zone for the
mean bubble velocity proﬁle is small. In the wall zone, themean bubble velocity was different at different axial posi-
tions in both bubbly ﬂow and churn-turbulent ﬂow. This was
due to the complexity of the ﬂow ﬁeld (i.e., the ﬂow direc-tion changed with time) and due to the existence of ﬂowcells.

Conclusions
The four-point optical probe performed efﬁciently both in
bubbly ﬂow and in highly churn-turbulent ﬂow. Bubble prop-
erties (local gas holdup, chord length, velocity, speciﬁc inter-facial area, and frequency) at these conditions in a 6.4-in. di-ameter bubble column were measured for the ﬁrst time.
In bubbly ﬂow, the radial proﬁles of speciﬁc interfacial
area, bubble frequency, and mean bubble velocity are all ﬂat.With an increase in superﬁcial gas velocity, U
g, these proﬁlesbecame more parabolic in shape. In the column center, the
bubble chord length distribution spreads wider with an
increase in Ug. The mean bubble chord length increases with
Uguntil it is in deep churn-turbulent ﬂow and then remains
almost identical with Ug. In the wall region, the bubble chord
length distribution does not change much with Ug. The mean
bubble chord length in the wall region is much smaller than
that in the column center, and it increases mildly with Ug
between the bubbly ﬂow and the transition ﬂow regime, then
decrease slightly with Ug.
At very low gas velocity, for example, 2 cm/s, all bubbles
move upward in bubble column. In churn-turbulent ﬂow ( Ug
[8 cm/s), some bubbles move downward even in the col-
umn center. In the wall region, the number of bubbles mov-ing downward is equal to or even larger than that of bubblesmoving upward. The percentage of bubbles moving down-
ward increases slowly with U
gin both the wall region and in
the core of the column.

In bubbly ﬂow, the bubble velocity distribution and bubble
chord length distribution are alike at different radial positions,including in the wall region. In churn-turbulent ﬂow, in the
core of the column the bubble velocity and chord length distri-
butions are alike at different radial position, but in the wallregion they are very different from the core of the column.
Two of the three spargers used in this study, that is, Sparger
No. 1 and No. 3, generated similar bubble properties at theoperating conditions employed, although their conﬁgurationsare totally different. Sparger No. 2 generates somewhat differ-
ent bubble properties than the other two spargers, though not
to a signiﬁcant extent. The sparger effect disappears with anincrease in the axial position in bubble column at z/D[5.1.
