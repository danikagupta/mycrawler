Indicator speciesABSTRACT
We investigated seabird plastic ingestion in the western Indian Ocean by analyzing the stomach contents of 222
individuals belonging to nine seabird species (including two endangered species endemics to Reunion Island).The most a ﬀected species were tropical shearwaters (79%) and Barau's petrels (59%). The average number of
plastic particles per contaminated bird was higher in Barau's petrels (6.10 ± 1.29) than in tropical shearwaters(3.84 ± 0.59). All other studied species also showed plastic presence in their stomach contents. The mass ofplastic particles was signi ﬁcantly higher both in juvenile's Barau's petrels and tropical shearwaters than in adults.
These results demonstrate the foraging areas of seabirds of the western Indian Ocean have a high level of plastic
pollution. In Reunion Island, hundreds of tropical shearwaters and Barau's petrels are attracted by urban lights
and die each year. We suggest taking advantage of this situation by using these species as long-term indicators ofplastic marine pollution in the region.
1. Introduction
The increasing rate of plastic pollution in the oceans worldwide is
well documented ( Derraik, 2002 ;Plastics Europe, 2013 ;Wilcox et al.,
2015 ) with concentrations of plastic fragments up to 580,000 pieces per
square kilometre ( Barnes et al., 2009 ). This emerging pollution is now a
major threat to marine wildlife, and this includes entanglement, in-
gestion and chemical contamination. Ingestion of plastic by marine
fauna has been reported all around the world ( Derraik, 2002; Talsness
et al., 2009; Verlis et al., 2014) and a ﬀects a large number of seabirds
including albatrosses, petrels, shearwaters, seagulls and boobies
(Azzarello and Van Vleet, 1987 ;Van Franeker and Law, 2015 ). The
consequences of plastic ingestion by seabirds include stomach ob-struction and internal wounds resulting in low body conditions and
death ( Ryan, 1988 ). Plastic ingestion can also impact the physical
condition of the bird, reduce their reproduction potential and causemortality due to toxins transfer ( Teuten et al., 2009; Lavers et al.,
2014 ). However the e ﬀects of plastic can vary among species, as some
species have the ability to regurgitate (e.g., skuas, albatross) thus lim-
iting undesired e ﬀects ( Azzarello and Van Vleet, 1987 ). The species
with a low capacity of regurgitation, except when feeding youngs (e.g.,petrels), are particularly susceptible to plastic accumulation ( Fumess,
1985 ). The e ﬀects of plastic ingestion can also vary in terms of re-
sidence time in seabirds' gastro-intestinal tracks depending on the sizeof the ingested items, the type of plastic and also the quantity andcomposition of other elements in birds stomachs ( Ryan, 2015 ). Most of
the studies on plastic ingestion realized so far have been focusing on thenorthern hemisphere ( Yamashita et al., 2011 ;Avery-Gomm et al., 2012;
Van Franeker and Law, 2015 ), but also in South Africa ( Ryan, 1987;
Ryan et al., 2016), South America ( Copello and Quintana, 2003) and
around eastern Australia ( Lavers et al., 2014 ;Gilbert et al., 2016). Only
few studies have been focusing on the tropical areas and all of them
were realized in the Paci ﬁc Ocean ( Spear et al., 1995 ;Verlis et al.,
2014 ;Verlis et al., 2018 ).
So far no information has been published on plastic ingestion rates
by seabirds in the western Indian Ocean. A few studies have shownplastic concentration in the water column ( Barnes, 2004 ), on the bea-
ches ( Duhec et al., 2015; Bouwman et al., 2016)
 and on marine turtles
(Hoarau et al., 2014). In this study we analyzed plastic ingestion in nine
seabird species breeding or foraging at Reunion Island and at Juan deNova (Mozambique Channel), among which two species are endemic
and endangered (the Barau's petrel, Pterodroma baraui ) or critically
endangered (the Mascarene petrel, Pseudobulweria aterrima ). The four
other breeding species of Reunion were included in the study: the tro-
pical shearwater ( Puﬃnus bailloni ), the wedge-tailed shearwater ( Ar-
denna paci ﬁca), the white-tailed tropicbird ( Phaethon lepturus ) and the
brown noddy ( Anous stolidus ). We also included the lesser noddy ( Anous
tenuirostris ), which does not breed in Reunion but which use the island

Tas a roosting place during its post-breeding migration, probably origi-
nating from nearby Mauritius or Seychelles populations. Finally we also
included the sooty tern ( Ornithoprion fuscatus ) from Juan de Nova as it
is one of the most abundant and widespread species of the region and ofthe tropical oceans as a whole ( Feare et al., 2007) as well as two Cape
Gannets ( Morus capensis ) found in Reunion Island and probably origi-
nating from South Africa.
2. Methods
All samples used for this study were found dead in Reunion Island or
Juan de Nova. Petrels and shearwaters from Reunion Island are at-
tracted by urban lights and a large scale rescue program has been
conducted since 1996 by the Société d'Etudes Ornithologique de La
Réunion (SEOR) to monitor the number of birds a ﬀected and ﬁnd so-
lutions to reduce the impact ( Le Corre et al., 2002 ;Salamolard et al.,
2007 ;Gineste et al., 2017; Rodriguez et al., 2017). The vast majority of
the birds found are rescued and released safely but 10% die as a con-sequence of fatal injuries. We used these dead birds for plastic ingestion
analysis. Similarly, seabirds a ﬀected by light pollution have previously
been used to perform plastic ingestion studies in the Canary Islands(Rodriguez et al., 2012 ) and a recent study has demonstrated the in-
terest of using birds disoriented by light for such a monitoring(Rodriguez et al., 2017). Other seabird species are regularly found by
people and brought to the wildlife rescue center of the SEOR. Thesebirds are generally injured or weakened by bad weather or marine
conditions. Some birds are rehabilitated and released while others die
and are kept frozen for later analysis. Sooty terns collected in Juan de
Nova all died from cat predation.
We decided to cover a wide range of species in order to capture the
variability of the vulnerability to plastic pollution in relation to trophic
ecology, foraging behavior, foraging ranges and migration strategies ofeach species. Samples from Reunion Island were obtained over a period
of 14 years (2002 –2016) and samples from Juan de Nova over a period
of four years (2004 –2008). Samples were kept frozen until necropsies
were performed in 2016. Before necropsy, birds were defrosted at room
temperature. Necropsies were performed by removing the rib cage and
pectoral muscles, exposing the abdominal viscera. Body condition of
the birds was analyzed by recording the state of the pectoral muscles
categorized as “good ”(muscles appear convex), “medium ”(muscle
appear ﬂat) or “poor ”(muscles appear concave). The content of the
gizzard and proventriculus were then examined for the presence of
plastic using a dissecting microscope. Plastics were counted and clas-
siﬁed by type: hard plastics, ﬁlms and ﬁbers ( Fig. 1). Items were placed
in Eppendorf tubes and dried in an oven at 50 °C for 48 h and thenweighed on a digital balance ( ± 0.00001 g). The color of plastic par-
ticles was not recorded.2.1. Statistical analyses
Data were analyzed using RStudio version 0.99.446 with univariate
tests to analyze di ﬀerences of plastic ingestion rates between species
and age classes. Data were analyzed to check for Normality with a
Shapiro test. When data were normal we used t-tests,
ANOVAs and
Tukey HSD tests. When data were not normal we used Kruskal Wallisand Pairwise Wilcox tests.
3. Results
Considering all species together, 50% of the birds analyzed had
plastic in their gizzard or proventriculus, but there was strong variation
in relation to species and age ( Figs. 2 and 3). The two most con-
taminated species were the tropical shearwater (79% of the birds hadplastic in their gut, n= 56) and the Barau's petrel (63%, n= 62), fol-
lowed by the lesser noddy (43%, n= 21), the brown noddy (33%
n= 9), the wedge-tailed shearwater (33%, n= 9), the white-tailed
tropicbird (29% n= 35) and the sooty tern (15%, n= 27). We analyzed
only one critically endangered Mascarene petrel and we found plastic in
its gut (100%, n= 1). Finally, we found one piece of ﬁber in one of the
Cape Gannet analyzed (50%, n=2 , Table 1). There was no relation
between plastic ingestion and muscular condition.
The average number of plastic particles per contaminated bird was
higher in Barau's petrel (6.10 ± 1.29) and tropical shearwaters
(3.84 ± 0.59) and lower in other species ( Fig. 2). We investigated the
eﬀect of age on plastic ingestion of tropical shearwaters, Barau's petrels
and white-tailed tropicbirds ( Fig. 3). There were no signi ﬁcant di ﬀer-
ences in the proportion of juveniles and adults having ingested plasticin the three studied species (Barau's petrels: Chi-square = 1.22,
p= 0.269; tropical shearwaters: Chi-square = 1.59, p= 0.208; white-
tailed tropicbird: Chi-square = 1.03, p= 0.310). The number of parti-
cles per contaminated bird was higher in juveniles than in adult Barau's
petrels (7.06 ± 1.57 and 2.38 ± 0.8 particles, respectively,
p< 0.001), tropical shearwaters (4.09 ± 0.62 and 3.33 ± 1.15 re-
spectively, p= 0.20), and white-tailed tropicbird (2.67 ± 1.20 and
1.71 ± 0.29 respectively, p= 0.06) but the di ﬀerence was signi ﬁcant
for Barau's petrels only.
We also tested di ﬀerences in the mass of the plastic particles in-
gested by Barau's petrels, tropical shearwaters and white-tailed tro-picbirds. There were no signi ﬁcant di ﬀerences between species
(p= 0.2735) but the mass of plastic particles was higher in juveniles
than in adults in both tropical shearwaters ( t= 2.1539, p= 0.0405)
and Barau's petrels ( t= 2.1109, p= 0.0429, Fig. 4).
The number of
juveniles and adults having ingested plastic was too low in white-tailedtropicbirds to investigate the e ﬀect of age. Regarding the amount and
the mass of plastic ingested over time, no signi ﬁcant di ﬀerences could
be observed. This study has only been performed on tropical

lyzed over time.
Hard plastic fragments, ﬁbers and ﬁlms were the main debris re-
corded in this study ( Fig. 1). Plastics found were mainly ﬁbers, reaching
a total of 100% for sooty terns and brown noddies ( Fig. 5 ). Hardfragments and ﬁlms also represented an important part of plastics in
Barau's petrels with on average 1.56 ± 1.15 and 1.51 ± 1.5 particles
per contaminated bird respectively. Hard fragments and ﬁlms were also
present in tropical shearwaters, tropicbirds and the wedge-tailedshearwaters' stomach contents ( Fig. 5). There were no signi ﬁcanta, ba

4. Discussion
4.1. Species-speci ﬁcd iﬀerences in plastic ingestion
Our study shows that the nine seabird species included in this study
ingest plastic accidentally or opportunistically when foraging or when
fed by their parents, but there were signi ﬁcant di ﬀerences between
species. Tropical shearwater and Barau's petrel were the two most im-pacted species, both in terms of ingestion occurrence and in terms of
number and mass of ingested plastic particles per bird. Petrels and
shearwaters are known to ingest plastic frequently in various parts of
the world ( Azzarello and Van Vleet, 1987; Moser and Lee, 1992;
Robards et al., 1995). In the northern Paci ﬁc Ocean, 88.5% of sooty
shearwater ( Puﬃnus griseus ) and 81.1% of short-tailed shearwater
(Puﬃnus tenuirostris ) had ingested plastic particles ( Ogi, 1990 ). Ogi's
study also revealed a signi ﬁcant increase in plastic ingestion from 1975
to 1987. More recently, short-tailed shearwaters have been studied onStradbroke Island in Australia between 2010 and 2012, showing aplastic ingestion rate of 67% (Acampora et al., 2014). Our study showsthat it is also the case in the western Indian Ocean. No previous study
has been done on plastic ingestion by tropical shearwaters or Barau's
petrel, although Danckwerts et al. (2016) noted opportunistically in a
study on foraging ecology and diet that 16.7% of the ﬂedglings Barau's
petrels had plastic particles in their gut ( n= 36 birds analyzed). The
level of plastic ingestion was lower in the wedge-tailed shearwater,which may be explained by the fact that we sampled mostly adults (7
out of 9) and adults are known to accumulate less plastic than ﬂedglings
(Acampora et al., 2014; Van Franeker and Law, 2015 and this study,
Table 2). No conclusions could be drawn regarding muscular condition
of the individuals compared to mean number or weight of particles. A
recent study recorded similar results on wedge-tailed shearwaters on
Lord Howe Island in Australia where there was no obvious inﬂ uence of
ingested plastic on the body condition of the individuals ( Lavers et al.,
2018 ).
The fact that petrels and shearwaters have more plastic in their gut
may be explained by the presence of a gizzard in the Procellariidae
which can accumulate non-digested food items such as squid beaks or
plastic particles. The foraging ecology of Procellariidae could also00.0050.010.0150.02

311explain this high ingestion rate. Petrels and shearwaters are often sca-
vengers and are susceptible to feed at the surface of the water on dead
preys or ﬂoating organic fragments and can therefore mistake plastic
for preys. Besides, Savoca et al., 2016 suggested that plastic debris emit
the scent of marine infochemicals (dimethyl sul ﬁde) creating an ol-
factory trap for olfactory foraging seabirds such as petrels and shear-waters. The rate of plastic ingestion was less important in the three
species of terns studied and on the white-tailed tropicbird, as found in
other studies ( Hyrenbach et al., 2013 ;Roman et al., 2016 ,Table 2 ).
Terns and tropicbirds perform plunge diving to catch their prey andthey do not scavenge. This probably reduces the risk of confusion with
plastic items ( Harrison, 1990 ).
Furthermore, the di ﬀerent species studied do not forage in the same
areas, which may result in di ﬀerent plastic ingestion rates due to dif-
ferent level of plastic pollution in these areas. Tracking studies havebeen realized in the western Indian Ocean ( Pinet et al., 2011 ;Le Corre
et al., 2012 ;Jaeger et al., 2017; unpublished data) and show di ﬀerent
feeding areas and migration patterns for most of the species studied
here. Similarly, previous studies have revealed an important plastic
diﬀerence found in stomach contents of a Fulmar species, Fulmarus
glacialis , between individuals from Alaska (average of 2.8 particles per
stomach) and individuals from California (average of 11.3 particles per
stomach). These di ﬀerences were attributed to di ﬀerent feeding areas,
coastal areas in California being more polluted due to high population(Van Franeker and Law, 2015).
4.2. Di ﬀerences of plastic ingestion in relation to age
Our results show a higher number and a higher mass of plastic
particles in juvenile Barau's petrels, compared to adults and a highermass of plastic particles in juvenile tropical shearwaters compared to
adults. These di ﬀerences are most probably due to food regurgitation
from the adults to feed the chicks. Indeed, juveniles do not regurgitate
and thus accumulate a large proportion of the plastic particles ingested
by adults. Several other studies have shown similar patterns, especially
among petrels and shearwaters ( Rodriguez et al., 2012; Verlis et al.,
2013 ;Acampora et al., 2013 ), but also on albatrosses ( Rapp et al.,
2017 ).
4.3. Types of ingested particles
In this paper we also brie ﬂy analyzed the types of plastic ingested.
Seabirds tend to select distinct shapes and colored plastic, confusing itfor potential preys ( Shaw and Day, 1994 ). More recent studies showed
the type of plastic ingested by seabirds was dependent on the plasticfragment characteristic ( UNEP, 2016 ). In this paper, some species such
asO. fuscatus orA. stolidus showed a distinct attraction for plastic ﬁberswith
an ingestion rate reaching 100% compared to other plastic ma-
terials. Fibers are also frequently found in every other species and comefrom the ﬁshing industry ( ﬁshing lines and ropes).
4.4. Implications for conservation
Our study shows that the level of plastic ingestion and accumulation
is particularly high in the endangered Barau's petrel (and possibly the
Critically endangered Mascarene petrel), compared to the other species
studied. The impacts of plastic debris on both individual survival and
population dynamics are di ﬃcult to measure, however other studies
have suggested that plastic ingestion may lead to gastrointestinalblockage, reduced storage volume of the stomach or uptake of ha-
zardous chemicals, impacting their reproduction potential and causing
mortality ( Azzarello and Van Vleet, 1987; Ryan, 1988 ;Teuten et al.,
2009 ). This is particularly worrying for the endemic petrels of Reunion
Island which dynamics is already weakened by invasive predators
(Faulquier et al., 2009), light-induced mortality ( Le Corre et al., 2002 )
and possibly global warming ( Legrand et al., 2016 ).
4.5. A call for a long term monitoring of plastic ingestion in the western
Indian Ocean
Our study is the ﬁrst to quantify plastic ingestion in a range of
tropical seabird species of the western Indian Ocean. We have shown
that in this part of the world the oceanic food webs are polluted by
plastic debris and this is very worrying as it may impact a wide range of
marine animals. We have also shown that ﬂedgling tropical shearwaters
and Barau's petrels are highly impacted. We suggest to use these twospecies as bioindicator species to monitor plastic pollution in this re-
gion. These two species are attracted by arti ﬁcial light and hundreds of
birds are found stranded annually and rescued ( Le Corre et al., 2002 ;
Gineste et al., 2017 ). Although on average 90% of the rescued birds are
released successfully, 10% are found dead or die as a consequence ofinjuries. This represent a regular and predictable number of dead birds,
estimated between 50 and 80 ﬂedglings Barau's petrels and 50 to 100
ﬂedgling tropical shearwaters which can be used for necropsies and
plastic ingestion monitoring as we did in this study (see also Rodriguez
et al., 2017 ). In the northern hemisphere, the level of plastic ingestion
in Northern Fulmars is routinely used by European policies as a long-
term indicator of environment quality and plastic pollution ( Van
Franeker and Law, 2015 ). The same monitoring should be implemented
in the western Indian Ocean and tropical shearwaters and Barau's pet-
rels are very appropriate for such a monitoring (see also Ryan et al.,
2009 ;Rodriguez et al., 2017 ).Table 2
