INTRODUCTION
Microphytobenthos contributes significantly to the
total system primary production in tidal flat estuariesand other shallow coastal systems (Colijn & de Jonge1984, de Jonge 1995a, MacIntyre et al. 1996, Cahoon1999, 2006, Underwood & Kromkamp 1999, Baird etal. 2004). These microalgae, mainly pennate diatoms,live at or near the sediment surface, where they pro-duce organic material predominantly during low tidewhen they are exposed. During high tide, a varyingpart of the microphytobenthos can become resus-
pended in the water column by the scouring effect ofwind-induced waves (de Jonge 1985, de Jonge & vanBeusekom 1995, Koh et al. 2006). The importance ofthis phenomenon depends on the elevation of theintertidal flats in relation to the local tidal charac -
teristics. Once resuspended, the tidal currents trans-port the diatoms between the submersed intertidalflats and the channels, during which they are mixedwith other water masses and redistributed (de Jonge& van Beusekom 1995). When resuspended, these

ABSTRACT: Long-term interannual variations in the mean microphytobenthos chlorophyll a
(chl a)of the Ems estuary were investigated. Concentrations in the 1990s were on average 1.5
times higher than during the period from 1976 to 1978, but a trend in chl aover the entire period
(1976 to 1999) was not found. In agreement with findings from the late 1970s, the mean chl a
 concentrations over the post 1990 period correlated significantly with the station elevation related
exposure time. Over the entire 1976 to 1999 study period, the estuary mean annual chl aconcen-
trations correlated strongly and significantly with the mean annual air temperature. Although therange of the variation in the mean annual air temperature of the studied years was only 7.5 to10.2°C, it surprisingly corresponded with a ca. 2.5-fold variation in the mean annual microphyto-benthos chl a. In addition to chl a, mean monthly C:chl aratios from 1976 to 1977 also correlated
positively with changes in temperature. Microphytobenthos carbon biomass [chl a× (C:chl a)]
may, therefore, respond even stronger to air temperature than chl adoes. The correlations are
most likely a combination of direct temperature effects on microphytobenthos and stronger, prob-ably complex, indirect temperature effects on the seasonal development and standing stock ofyoung and adult grazers (bivalves) and their carnivores like the brown shrimp Crangon crangon .

microalgae, interestingly, continue to contribute to
the primary production in the water column (V. N. deJonge and H. Peletier unpubl. experimental results).
The system-wide contribution of the microphyto-
benthos (benthic plus resuspended) to the total pri-mary production is variable, but can, as establishedfor the Ems estuary with ~50% intertidal flats, be ashigh as that of the ‘real’ phytoplankton (de Jonge1995a). The estuary-wide microphytobenthos chloro-phyll a(chl a)mass in the top 2 cm of the sediment
can easily exceed the chl amass in the water (de
Jonge 1995a). There is clear evidence that microphy-tobenthos supports the benthic food web (Decho &Fleeger 1988, Hecky & Hesslein 1995, Herman et al.2000, Middelburg et al. 2000,  Moncreiff & Sullivan
2001) and that it is an important food source for cer-tain benthic fauna species (e.g. Hummel 1985,Kamermans 1994) as well as pelagic copepods (deJonge & van Beusekom 1992). This all indicates thatthese benthic microalgae play a  pivotal role for the
functioning of estuarine systems in  general.
The primary factors that regulate microphytoben-
thos production and biomass are typically light andnutrients. Yet, during the investigation period, the nu-trient concentrations in most of the water column andin the sediments of the Ems estuary were most likelynot growth-limiting (de Jonge 1995b, 2000), a phe-nomenon that has been observed in many of the west-ern European systems (de Jong et al. 1994,  Brotas et
al. 1995, Barranguet et al. 1998). In contrast, the un-derwater light conditions were and still are stronglygrowth-limiting for phytoplankton in most of the Emsestuary (Colijn 1982, 1983, de Jonge 1983, 2000, vanBeusekom & de Jonge 1998), which in creases the im-
portance of microphytobenthos for the primary pro-duction of the entire ecosystem. For the intertidalflats, the light climate during submersion is deter-mined by the ambient irradiance in combination withwater turbidity, which is partly controlled by windand wave action (de Jonge 1995a, de Jonge & vanBeusekom 1995), and water depth. During low tide,the light climate of the intertidal flats is determined byweather and season in combination with the elevationof the intertidal flat and the tidal phase, which to-gether determine the exposure time of the sedimentsurface (see also Colijn & de Jonge 1984). Apart fromenvironmental factors, the microphytobenthos pri-mary production is also determined by its packingdensity. Blanchard et al. (2001, 2002, 2006, Herlory etal. 2004) found that a net primary production only oc-curred when the chl aconcentrations in the top 1 cm
sediment layer were lower than ~160 to 170 mg m
−2.
Higher chl adensities mostly resulted in net algal res-piration, which was ascribed to a limitation of inor-
ganic carbon or nutrients (Admiraal et al. 1982, Cooket al. 2010) or severe light limitation. Also, biotic fac-tors, like grazing, influence standing stock and pri-mary production of the microphytobenthos. Since theinteractions between all the above mentionedphysico-chemical, physical and biological factors leadto complicated and interwoven ‘bottom-up’ and ‘top-down’ controls, it is not a straightforward process todetermine the causes of measured variations in chl a
in coastal systems (see de Jonge & Essink 1991).
Despite these problems and shortcomings, much is
known and there is data available to qualitativelyasses within year dynamics of microphytobenthoschla. This is, however, not so for longer term (inter-
annual) variations. Given the ongoing debate on thepossible impact of climate change at all ecosystemlevels, an interesting question is to what extent temperature may determine interannual chl aand
related organic carbon biomass variations of themicrophytobenthos and how this in turn affects thetotal food web.
The role of many factors involved in the seasonal
regulation of the microphytobenthos growth andstanding stock in the field has been clarified in somedetail in the past, except for the effect of tempera-ture. Therefore, in the present paper, we focus onpossible temperature effects in relation to chl amass
variations, using data from the Ems estuary.
The role of nutrients (Admiraal 1977a, Colijn 1983,
Helder 1983), light (Colijn & van Buurt 1975, Admi-raal & Peletier 1980, Colijn 1982), system residencetime (Helder & Ruardij 1982), interaction betweentidal flats and water (de Jonge 1995a, de Jonge & vanBeusekom 1995) and estuarine transport and ex -
change processes (Baretta & Ruardij 1988) have allbeen investigated and discussed at a system-widescale for the Ems estuary. The overall conclusion wasthat light (and consequently elevation; see Colijn &de Jonge 1984, de Jonge & Colijn 1994) was the mostimportant determinant for the available chl aand pri-
mary production of microphytobenthos and phyto-plankton.
In short-term experimental investigations, Blan-
chard et al. (1997, 2001), Colijn & van Buurt (1975)and Admiraal (1977b) studied algal growth in rela-tion to temperature. The latter 2 teams experimen-tally demonstrated a clear temperature effect on thegrowth of benthic diatoms, while Admiraal & Peletier(1980) found the same for developing natural benthicdiatom films in microcosms under field conditions.Despite this research, up to now no clear effect oftemperature on the chl a(or carbon biomass) of the44de Jonge et al.: Microphytobenthos and air temperature
microphytobenthos was detected when considering
field data.
The main focus of the present paper is to test
whether there is a relationship between temperatureand long-term variation in the mean microphytoben-thos chl acontent of the sediment in the Ems estuary
and to discuss the possible implications of such arelationship. This is especially interesting as the tem-peratures in western Europe are rising faster thanelsewhere on earth (van Oldenborgh et al. 2008).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study area
The Ems estuary (Fig. 1) is a coastal plain estuary,
which crosses the Wadden Sea at the border betweenthe Netherlands and Germany. Excluding the outerdelta and including the freshwater tidal river, the sur-face area covers ~475 km
2. The length of the estuary
is ~70 km and, including the freshwater tidal river,the total length is ~100 km. Approximately 40% ofthe lower reaches (the area seaward of Stn 2 in Fig. 1)and as much as 80% of the Dollard (Fig. 1) compriseintertidal flats. The tidal prism of the estuary at theinlet is ~10
9m3(de Jonge 1992a). The tidal range
varies from ~2.3 m in the tidal inlet to over 3.0 m nearDelfzijl and Emden.
Sampling stations
Microphytobenthos in the Ems estuary has been
studied for many years with the aim of modelling theecosystem functioning dynamics (Baretta & Ruardij
1988). Within this context, a sampling scheme wasdeveloped based on the system’s bathymetry andphysical features. In 1992, Rijkswaterstaat startedmicrophytobenthos monitoring at the 6 locations inthe Ems estuary (Fig. 1) which had been previouslysampled (de Jonge & Colijn 1994).
Sampling
The corer based sampling procedure used from
1976 to 1978 has been described by de Jonge &  Colijn
(1994). Sampling was always done with a perspexcore of 2.4 cm inner diameter. During 1992 and 1994to 1999, the monthly samples were taken with a com-parable corer. Three substations per sampling station(consisting of a 500 × 500 m quadrat) were selected forsampling the elevation gradient. Based on the de tai -
led study results from 1972 to 1986 (e.g. van Es 1982,Colijn 1983, de Jonge 1992b), 5 cores were taken atevery substation in a circle to arrive at a representativepigment value per station. The cores were sliced andthe upper 0.5 cm of the 5 cores pooled by substationfor chl aanalysis. Samples were stored at −30°C and
lyophilized before extraction in 90% acetone.
Chl aanalysis and conversions
From 1976 to 1978 (the ‘pre-1990 period’), chl awas
determined spectrophotometrically. Concentrationswere expressed in weight per unit surface area(mg m
−2) for the top 0.5 cm sediment layer. Pigment
concentrations were measured using a modification45

(addition of 60 µl of 10% HCl; Moed & Hallegraeff
1978) of Lorenzen’s method (1967) and an overnightextraction time at 4°C. During 1992 and 1994 to 1999(‘post-1990 period’), the sediment was sampled bycomparable corers as above and again using anovernight period to extract the chl a, after which
measurements were carried out by HPLC as de -
scribed by Daemen (1986). The chl avalues were
expressed as a content on a weight per dry weightbasis (µg g
−1) for the top 0.5 cm sediment layer. The
HPLC derived values are on average ~70% the val-ues derived with the spectrophotometrical method ofLorenzen (Daemen 1986). To make the data of theentire 1976 to 1999 set mutually comparable and con-sistent with most of the literature, all data were con-verted to concentrations as measured by Lorenzen’smethod. Conversion was done by multiplying theHPLC values with a factor 1.43 (based on Daemen1986). The conversion from weight per weight (of thepost-1990 data) to weight per m
2was based on the
specific density of the sediment at the 6 stations.These values were obtained during a full sedimento-logical analysis by D. J. de Jong (unpubl.) and carriedout in 1992 and 1994. The effect of increasing mudcontent on the specific density of the sediment isillustrated in Fig. 2. The total range covers 0.63 to1.69 g cm
−3and shows that the muddier the sediment
is, the lower its specific density will be. The sedi-ments with the lowest mud content (Stns 1 and 5)usually do not reach the mud content of the moremuddy stations (Stns 4, 2 and 6). This means that,despite the variation in values, the gradient in Fig. 2is a persistent one. There was unfortunately no datato illustrate any available seasonal effect.
Environmental factors
Seasonal effects of environmental conditions and
biotic interactions have been investigated before ona seasonal basis and were also incorporated in theecosystem model of the Ems estuary (Baretta &Ruardij, 1988). This, however, does not hold forlonger term interannual variations. To find an expla-nation for long temporal scale related variations inchl aconcentrations among stations and years, the
effect of station elevation, irradiance, turbidity (Sus-pended Matter concentration = SPM), wind speedand air temperature were investigated for the post-1990 period. The quality of the data on water temper-ature was too low to be used. This was due to the factthat water temperatures were only measured duringwater sampling. The elevations of the different sta-tions and substations were derived from soundings
carried out in the 1990s by Rijks waterstaat. SPM data
was obtained from the Rijks waterstaat DONAR mon-
itoring database. Data on air temperature, irradianceand wind speed were obtained from the KNMI (RoyalNetherlands Meteorological Institute). Mean mete -
oro logical conditions were calculated based on 3
meteorological stations close to the coast in the studyarea (Lauwersoog, Eelde and Nieuw Beerta).
For the pre-1990 period environmental data were
not available in the required detail for the abovementioned meteorological stations, so only meanannual air temperatures and mean annual chl aval-
ues were used. The post-1990 data on mean annualair temperature and mean annual chl aand the same
data from the pre-1990 period (the years 1976 to 1978from de Jonge & Colijn 1994) were combined toinvestigate the relationship between air temperatureand chl a.
C:chl aratios
In addition to chl a, an existing data set on C:chl a
ratios from 1976 to 1978 (de Jonge 1980) was re-analysed to investigate the possible effect of air tem-perature (Table 1). In de Jonge 1980, temperaturewas not considered as a possible relevant factorexplaining the observed seasonal fluctuations in C:chl aratios. De Jonge (1980) concluded that C:chl a
varied seasonally per sampling period and that therewere no spatial, i.e. no among-stations differences inC:chl a. Therefore, for the present paper, data from
all 6 stations were pooled and the monthly meanC:chl aratios calculated. The aim was to investigate
whether the variation in the monthly mean C:chl a
ratios correlated with air temperature. If so, then thatresult could be used to indicate to what extent any46

Data sets
The data sets in this paper were derived from dif-
ferent sources, yielding different data sub-sets,except for mean annual chl aand mean annual air
temperature. Table 1 provides an overview of thestructure of the data sets used.
Statistical analyses
The chl adata for the top 0.5 cm sediment layer did
not follow a normal distribution. To satisfy the re -
quirements for the application of parametric tests(Zar 1984), the data were log-transformed. To testwhether data from substations could be used as inde-pendent data in the analysis, the spatial autocorrela-tion was calculated, using Moran’s Itest (R Develop-
ment Core Team 2007). A General Linear Model(GLM) was applied to test for differences betweenthe means among Station (Stn), Year (Yr) and Month(Mo), followed by the Tukey multiple comparison testto determine the differences be tween the classes.
The η
2statistic was used to describe the proportion of
the total variation that is attributable to a specificpredictor variable. The possible relationships be -
tween chl aconcentrations and independent vari-
ables, such as air temperature, were tested usingSpearman correlation tests and a multiple backwardregression. The calculation of the independent con-tribution of each variable to the total explained vari-ance of the regression model was carried out usinghierarchical partitioning (Chevan & Sutherland1991).The chl adata series in the post-
1990 period (1992, 1994 to 1999)were often incomplete. If this hap-pened, the data were case wisedeleted. All statistical analyseswere carried out in SPSS 15.0,except for the calculations of thespatial autocorrelation and thehierarchical partitioning, whichwere carried out in R (R Develop-ment Core Team 2007).
RESULTS
Factors explaining spatial and temporal changes
in chl a
Spatial autocorrelation of substations
As a first step, we determined whether the data col-
lected at the 3 substations within each station wereindependent, by calculating the spatial autocorrela-tion. The chl aconcentrations of the 3 substations
were spatially autocorrelated in all cases (Moran’s I=
0.088, p < 0.001). The data from substations were,therefore, pooled, using the mean chl aconcentra-
tions per station for further analysis.
Trends
The mean monthly chl aconcentrations for the
6 stations in 1992, and 1994 to 1999 (Fig. 3) showstrong variation among Stns, mo and yr, without avisually clear seasonal pattern. A 3-way ANOVA(data set 1c in Table 1) with Stn, Yr and Mo as inde-pendent factors revealed significant effects of all 3factors and their 2-way interaction terms, and ex -
plained 75% of the observed variation (Table 2). Thefactor yr had a significant effect on the mean chl a
concentration with the highest η
2of the 3 main fac-
tors (Table 2), with significantly higher values in 1992and 1999 and lower values in 1996 (Tukey test, p <0.05). Stn and mo were also significant, with lowerchl aconcentrations measured at Stn 3 and 4, and
between December and March, and higher valuesreported at Stn 6, and between May and October (seealso Fig. 3). Interannual and seasonal effects wereapparent with a high η
2(0.601) for the Yr × Mo inter-
action term (Table 2).

tion were plotted as a time series (Fig. 4). The values
of all Stns decreased from 1992 to 1996, after whichthey increased again. Fig. 4 (see also the estuary-wide annual means in Fig. 6) illustrates that therewas no overall increasing or decreasing temporaltrend in chl aduring 1992, and 1994 to 1999. Given
the fact that the individual sampling stations arelocated in the ~50 km long main part of the estuary(Fig. 1) and are situated far from each other (max.distance ca. 40 km), it is clear that estuary-wide oper-ating factors or processes must have been responsi-ble for the observed interannual variations.
Station exposure time
The highest elevated station was Stn 6, and the
lowest were Stns 2, 3 and 4. The maximal differ-ence in elevation was 2.3 m which, compared tothe local tidal range of ~3 m, results in a large dif-ference in exposure times among stations. Withinsome stations (thus among substations), the differ-ence in elevation was also relatively large, e.g. atStn 2 the difference between highest and lowestelevated substation was 1.0 m. When averaged
over all years, the log-transformed chl aconcentra-
tions of all 18 substations were significantly andpositively correlated with the average exposuretime (Fig. 5; GLM: F
1,17= 33.774, p < 0.001),
explaining 68% of the total variation. This suggeststhat exposure time related factors like irradiance,wind speed and air temperature might also be can-didate factors, explaining a part of the differencesin chl aconcentrations among stations.49

Effect of physical factors
Using the monthly mean chl avalues, we tested for
the influence of air temperature (T), irradiance, sus-
pended matter and wind speed, using the non-para-metric Spearman rank correlation test (Table 3). Allthe presented correlations were highly significant.As expected, chl avalues were positively related to T
and irradiance and negatively to wind speed andsuspended matter, with the highest rank correlationcoefficient for T(r
S= 0.55). These independent fac-
tors strongly co-vary, and a backward multiple re -
gression only maintained Tas the single significant
factor in the model (t= 3.189, n = 73, p <0.01). A hier-
archical partitioning confirmed this pattern, as theindependent contribution of Tto the total explainedvariance was larger than that of the other 4 variables
combined (respectively 0.074 and 0.064%).
Supported by the above analyses, a plot represent-
ing the time series of the mean annual Tand the
mean log-transformed annual chl avalues for 1992,

a good correlation between chl aand T. This resulted
in the decision to extend the 1992, 1994 to 1999 datasets with older data for a more thorough analysis ofthe correlation between mean Tand estuary-wide

annual T(Fig. 7; GLM: F1,10= 14.157; p = 0.004; based
on data set 2 in Table 1, see also Table 4). Despite therelatively small range in the annual mean values (7.5to 10.2°C), the explained variance is relatively high,amounting to nearly 60%. The lowest mean chl a
value in the temperature range is 56.2 (1978) and thehighest 137.8 (1992) mg chl am
−2, a difference of a
factor of ~2.5. To demonstrate that this picture is notbiased by extending the original 1992, 1994 to 1999data set with the older data, a separate regression for1992, 1994 to 1999 was carried out as well. This latteranalysis resulted in a similar fit (y= 23.14 x− 123.51
and R
2= 0.53).
Important to note is that there was no consistent
difference between the 2 chl ameasurements meth-

C:chl aratios for 1976 and 1977 follow the temporal
variation of the mean monthly T(Fig. 8a). Data from
1978 was not incorporated in this analysis because itwas too fragmented to represent either a reliabletemporal variation or an appropriate annual averagevalue (see de Jonge 1980 for further details).
Fig. 8b shows a linear regression of the mean
monthly C:chl aratios to the mean monthly Tover the
same 2 yr (y= 1.28 x− 29.94; GLM, F
1,21= 12.568; p =
0.0019; 95% CI for the re gression coefficient: 0.53−
2.03; based on data set 3 in Table 1). Although the re-gression is significant, the relatively low explainedvariance of 37% indicates that  factors other thantemp erature are also responsible for explaining the
observed variation in C:chl aratios.
DISCUSSION
Annual variations in benthic chl a
Causes for the large observed variation in the
mean annual benthic chl aconcentrations are typi-
cally grazing, resources and other environmental fac-tors, as investigated here. The observed temperaturerelated interannual variations are so strong (ca. 2.5-fold) that a combination of >1 temperature relatedeffect is likely and, thus, should to be considered.
It is not likely that nutrients played a major role, or
that the water residence time in the system hadchanged. Thus, in case of the Ems estuary, other fac-tors must be used to explain the major variations.These are temperature (Martens 2001, van Beuse -
kom et al. 2009, present study), and light climaterelated factors caused by wind related turbidity
changes (de Jonge 1995a), dredgingactivities (de Jonge 1983, 2000) andharbour spoil disposal (de Jonge & deJong 2002).
Despite the fact that we have not
been able to investigate the role ofgrazers due to lack of data, it is likelythat grazers controlled the inter -
annual chl avariations as well (e.g.
Alpine & Cloern 1992, Hansen et al.1993, Keller et al. 1999, Herman et al.2000, Middelburg et al. 2000, Loebl &van Beusekom 2008). These factorswill be discussed in some detail belowin the section ‘Temperature, macro-zooobenthos and carnivores’.51

air temperatures (T)from KNMI for the period 1976−1999. TE: total estuaryMar Ecol Prog Ser 468: 43–56, 2012
Temperature and microphytobenthos
In relatively turbid systems like the Ems Estuary,
intertidal microphytobenthos is mainly photosynthet-ically active when low tides coincide with the dailyphotoperiod. This implies that the physiological func-tioning of these microalgae may indeed be moredetermined by the strongly fluctuating air tempera-tures and related water temperatures in the diatomfilms during exposure than the more stable watertemperature, as measured in the main channels.
The periodic exposure which microphytobenthos
experiences also implies that these microalgae needto be very well adapted to highly dynamic environ-ments, where sometimes the sediment temperaturein summer may increase by 4°C h
−1(Harrison 1985).
Blanchard et al. (1997, 2006) performed field experi-ments on the photosynthetic capacity (P) of micro-phytobenthos during different seasons and differenttemperature increase rates (T) and observed invari-able P – T curves over the year. The optimum temper-ature for photosynthesis was found at 25°C, while acomplete stop was measured at 38°C.
These results may be used as an indi-cation of the short-term chl aresponse
of the microphytobenthos to tempera-ture. Despite the very high local chl a
values at times (Fig. 3), this may implythat there is the possibility for somefurther increase in chl alevels. How-
ever, loss terms such as respiration,grazing and resuspension (de Jonge1995a, Guarini et al. 2006) and gainterms such as (strong local) sedimen-tation of wind-wave induced resus-pended microphytobenthos (de Jonge1995a) also determine if and when anin crease in primary production is re -
flected in an increase in biomass.Thus, there is most likely a limit to the(future) development of the benthicchl aconcentration which is caused by
algal density related growth limitation(Blanchard et al. 2001, 2002, 2006,Herlory et al. 2004).
The above-mentioned maximum
amount of chl aof ~160 to 170 mg m

workers for their sampled 1 cm sedi-ment layer, which corresponds to ~120to 200 mg m

sediment layer as sampled by deJonge & Colijn 1994) may be ex ceeded
considerably and reach values as high as 500 mg m
−2
chl a(Colijn & de Jonge 1984, Cahoon 1999), while
peak values can even reach 1000 mg m−2(present
study). These higher levels are not necessarily theresult of higher production, but might be the result ofthe above mentioned accumulation due to sedimen-tation of microalgae since resuspended material isnot deposited in a uniform fashion over the intertidalflats. Therefore, despite the linear regression pre-sented in Fig. 7, we expect that the presented curvemay bend to an upper saturation level, which maycorrespond with data as referred to above.
Temperature, macrozooobenthos and carnivores
Apart from influencing the microphytobenthos
directly, the existing seasonal variations, interannualtemperature variations and cold winters may alsoindirectly affect the chl amass via influencing the
behaviour, growth and reproduction of macrozoo -

(Beukema 1985, Beukema et al. 2001, Strasser et al.2001, Beukema & Dekker 2005) and epifauna like thebrown shrimp Crangon crangon (Beukema 1992,
Jönsson et al. 1993, Strasser, 2002). Moreover, it ispossible that what has been found here for the abovespecies also holds for other benthic species like themud shrimp Corophium volutator , the mud snail
Hydrobia ulvae and the lug worm Arenicola marina .
This point is very relevant as the above mentionedmacrozoobenthos species are not evenly distributedover the Ems estuary. If the varying chl amasses of
the microphytobenthos could be clearly related tovariations in grazing pressure and related resuspen-sion stimulating activity of epifauna (e.g. Crangon
crangon, Corophium volutator) or macrozoobenthos,
then we should have an important explanation forboth the short-term and the long-term variations inthe benthic and resuspended chl amass.
Turbidity and light
Based on in situ measurements in the lower
reaches of the Ems estuary, Colijn (1983) showed thatduring high tide the microphytobenthos productioncan benefit from clear water. He determined that thiseffect could increase the annual microphytobenthosproduction (and consequently the chl aconcentra-
tions) by ~35%, compared to a situation where theprimary production only occurred during exposure ofthe same area. Despite this finding, the averagewater turbidity in our analysis was only a weak pre-dictor for explaining the monthly variation in chl a
concentrations. This is remarkable because apartfrom the reported wind driven natural variation inSPM concentrations (de Jonge 1995a, 2000, de Jonge& van Beusekom 1995), there is also a major (since1970s) anthropogenic component in this estuarycaused by channel maintenance dredging, the dis-posal of harbour sludge (de Jonge 1983) and majorengineering works in the freshwater tidal river Emsitself since the mid 1980s with significant implica-tions for the entire system (Schuttelaars et al. 2012).The result of the dredging activities was a ~2- to 3-fold SPM increase in the main channels of the mainestuary during the early 1990s compared to 1954,and of which the effects are also measurable duringhigh water above the submerged intertidal flats (deJonge 1995a, de Jonge & van Beusekom 1995). Ifincreased SPM affected microphytobenthos chl a,
then one would have expected 2 independentregression lines in Fig. 7, one for the 1970s to 1980s
and one for the 1990s. This is clearly not the case andeffects of increased SPM on microphytobenthos chl a
concentrations, even in the lower reaches of theintertidal flats (Stn 1), can most likely be excluded.
Wind-induced resuspension
The resuspension of microphytobenthos into the
water column is an important process determining themicrophytobenthos chl adistribution between the in-
tertidal flats and the water column (de Jonge & vanBeusekom 1995, Koh et al. 2006). Due to windy, butnot necessarily stormy, conditions a significant part ofthe microphytobenthos is resuspended into the watercolumn where it continues to grow like phytoplankton(V. N. de Jonge & H. Peletier unpubl. experimental re-sults). Under normal wea ther conditions, only ~25%
of the total microphytobenthos chl ais present in the
water column in this estuary (de Jonge 1995a). Understrong winds conditions (e.g. 12 m s
−1wind speed),
this value only doubles (de Jonge & van Beusekom1995). Within the context of this paper, the effect ofwind on resuspension is not strong enough to accountfor the 2.5-fold variation observed in the benthic chl a.
C:chl a ratios
In the literature, chl ais often considered a suitable
proxy for algal biomass, but this assumption is not cor-rect. In the late 1970s (de Jonge 1980), a significant(up to an order of magnitude) temporal variation inC:chl aratios was measured. Consequently, algal bio-
mass cannot simply be calculated from chl avalues
through linear transformation, nor can chl avalues be
directly converted into carbon biomass by using aconstant (mean annual) C:chl aratio. Thus, it is of im-
portance to verify whether there is a possible amplifi-cation of the temperature effect on chl aby an addi-
tional effect via the C:chl aratio. When using seasonal
data, this is indeed the case, but the seasonal temper-ature effect on the C:chl aratio is so modest (only 3%
increase per 1°C air temperature; Fig. 8b) that the ulti-mate effect on the carbon biomass is considered to bemarginal compared to the direct effect on chl a.
Future estuarine functioning
When the findings and suggestions by Martens
(2001) and van Beusekom et al. (2009) for the List53Mar Ecol Prog Ser 468: 43–56, 2012
tidal basin (German Wadden Sea) are combined
with a part of our results for the Ems estuary, it maybe that an overall increase in temperature may leadto a decrease in the spring bloom of the phytoplank-ton and to an increase in the benthic microphyto-benthos biomass. Due to wind-induced resuspensionof the microphytobenthos (de Jonge 1995a, deJonge & van Beusekom 1995), an increase in thebenthic biomass will consequently lead to anincrease of microphytobenthos in the water column,therefore, the proportion between resuspendedmicrophytobenthos chl aand that of phytoplankton
will increase. This suggests that if the average tem-peratures or the water turbidity further increase, agradual shift may occur in the relative importanceof primary produc tion from phytoplankton to micro-
phytobenthos. However, based on the observationsand calculations by Blanchard et al. (2001, 2002,2006, Herlory et al. 2004), there is most likely a limitto this development by algal density related growthlimitation.
The functioning of the phytoplankton is further
dependent on water temperature and favourable tur-bidity and light conditions, while the microphytoben-thos is more dependent on suitable growth condi-tions governed by favourable weather conditions.How this under the current human pressures (e.g.dredging and engineering works) and climatechange related developments may work out in thefuture and also in systems with a lower turbidity thanthe Ems estuary is not clear and needs furtherresearch.
Additionally, the reproduction of autochthonous
grazers and their carnivores, and also invaders likethe rapidly developing bivalve Crassostrea gigas
(Buschbaum et al. 2011), may be affected by chang-ing temperatures. How this potential effect modifiesthe food web and, thus, the functioning of both thepelagic as well as the benthic system in the WaddenSea needs further attention.
Despite the integrative modelling exercise carried
out for this estuary in the past (Baretta & Ruardij1988), it is still unclear how the above mentioned fac-tors (temperature, light conditions, respiration, graz-ing and resuspension) interact on a more detailedlevel. Thus, there is an urgent need for an integratedapproach to these issues in future studies. 
In addition, we also need to give high priority to a
clear coupling of strongly improved monitoring pro-grams and further development of ecosystem models(de Jonge et al. 2006), because microphytobenthos ismuch more important for coastal areas than gener-ally recognized.CONCLUSIONS
This long-term study produced two major conclu-
sions: (1) The microphytobenthos in the Ems estuaryshows a strong positive response to temperature, a~2.5-fold variation in the mean annual chl aconcen-
trations within a mean annual range in air tempera-ture of 7.5 to 10.2°C and (2) the remarkably stronginterannual response of microphytobenthos chl ato
temperature seems only explainable from a combina-tion of factors that, apart from direct ‘bottom-up’ tem-perature effects to the algae (e.g. C:chl aand unmea-
sured algal activity) also comprise temperaturerelated variations in ‘top-down’ control via grazersand even their carnivores.
