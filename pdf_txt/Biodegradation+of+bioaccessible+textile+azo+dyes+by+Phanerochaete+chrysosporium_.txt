Abstract
Azo dyes are important chemical pollutants of industrial origin. Textile azo dyes with bioaccessible groups for
lignin degrading fungi, such as 2-methoxyphenol (guaiacol) and 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (syringol), were synthesisedusing different aminobenzoic and aminosulphonic acids as diazo components. The inocula of the best biodegradationassays were obtained from a pre-growth medium (PAM), containing one of the synthesised dyes. The results of thedye biodegradation assays were evaluated every 7 days, by the decrease of the absorbance at the maximumwavelength of the dye, by the decrease of the sucrose concentration in the culture medium and by the increase of thebiomass during the 28 days of assay. It was observed that the extent of dye biodegradation depended on the sucroseconcentration, on the degraded dye structure and, on the dye present in the PAM medium. © 2001 Elsevier ScienceB.V.

1. Introduction
Synthetic azo dyes are extensively used in the
textile and dyestuff industries. Efﬂuents fromthese industrial processes are usually resistant tobiological treatment and the azo dyes are consid-ered recalcitrant xenobiotic compounds due to thepresence of a N /p4N bond and other possible
groups that are not easily biodegraded, as forinstance the sulphonic group (SO
3H). The azo
dyes are toxic, and also become harmful to theenvironment by the formation of aromatic amines
(anilines), which are carcinogenic and /or muta-
genic. The anilines are formed by the reductivecleavage of the azo bond that, usually, occurs inanaerobiose conditions by many strains of bacte-ria (Chung and Stevens, 1993; Gottschalk andKnackmuss, 1993). In addition, under aerobic oranaerobic–aerobic conditions using a bacterialconsortium, mineralisation of dyes can occur(Haug et al., 1991; Dubrow et al., 1996; Malpei,1996). More recently, dye biodegradation byyeasts (Luo and Liu, 1996) in particular biodegra-dation of textile azo dyes in batch-aerated cultures(Martins et al., 1999) have been investigated.

Spadaro et al., 1992). The biodegradation of theeight synthesised azo dyes by P.chrysosporium
was studied in order to establish the relationshipbetween the chemical structure of the dye andthe extent of biodegradation, after de ﬁning the
optimal conditions for the assays. The biodegra-dation assays were performed in liquid medium,under nitrogen-limiting conditions, since ligni-nolytic activity of P.chrysosporium is induced in
these conditions (Keyser et al., 1978; Kirk et al.,1978; Jeffries et al., 1981; Glenn and Gold,1983; Spadaro et al., 1992; Ollikka et al., 1993).
2. Material and methods
2.1.Azo dyes synthesis
Eight azo dyes were synthesised (Fig. 1) by
diazotation of meta orpara aminobenzoic or
aminosulphonic acids (diazo components) andcoupling with guaiacol or syringol (couplingcomponents).
To a solution of the diazo component (25
mmol) in NaOH 5% (16 ml) and water (46 ml),a solution of NaNO
2(20 mmol) in water (4 ml)
was added and stirred. The resulting solutionwas added slowly with continuous stirring to amixture of HCl
conc (4 ml) and ice (50 g) main-
taining the temperature between 0 and 5 °C. A
precipitate was formed. Then the diazotised acidwas added portionwise to the cooled couplingcomponent solution (20 mmol) in NaOH 5% (40ml) with stirring. Finally, NaCl (40 g) wasadded and the mixture was stirred continuouslyduring 30 min at room temperature. The precipi-tated azo dye was ﬁltered and washed with etha-
nol and ether.
The synthesised dyes (Table 1) were character-
ised using UV-visible, IR and
1H-NMR spec-
troscopy and mass spectrometry.
The nomenclature presented in this paper, ex-
pressing the diazo component /p147coupling compo-
nent, is used in textile chemistry to suggest thesynthetic process. The siglas used refer the kind ofLigninolytic fungi have shown the ability to
degrade numerous aromatic organopollutants in-cluding polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons viaoxidative mechanisms (Bogan and Lamar, 1995;Hammel, 1995). Some of these ﬁlamentous
fungi, that are able to degrade cellulose, hemi-cellulose and lignin, as the white rot fungusPhanerochaete chrysosporium , have also shown
the capacity of biodegrading azo dyes till theircomplete mineralisation by oxidative mecha-nisms, avoiding the formation of anilines as in-termediates (Paszczynski et al., 1991; Spadaro etal., 1992; Zhou and Zimmermann, 1993). Theazo dyes biodegradation is enhanced under spe-ciﬁc conditions of the culture medium, particu-
larly under nitrogen-limiting conditions (Spadaroet al., 1992) and it was shown that the biodegra-dation also depends on the chemical structure ofthe azo dye, nature of the substituents and theirrelative position (Pasti-Grigsby et al., 1992;Paszczynski et al., 1992).
In this work, eight textile azo dyes were syn-
thesised using aminobenzoic and aminosulphonicacids as diazo components and bioaccessiblegroups such as 2-methoxyphenol (guaiacol) and2,6-dimethoxyphenol (syringol) as coupling com-ponents. The bioaccessible groups are present inthe lignin structure and seem to be access pointsto the fungus ligninolytic enzymes produced byM.A.M.Martins et al ./Journal of Biotechnology 89 (2001) 91 –98 93

(=ATCC 24725), used in this study was ob-
tained from the culture collection of Micotecada Universidade do Minho (MUM). Stock cul-tures were maintained on TWAcellulose mediumat 4 °C, with periodic transfer.
3. Media
The liquid culture medium, LCM (sucrose 5 g
l
−1, ammonium sulphate 0.5 g l−1, yeast nitro-
gen base, YNB without amino acids and ammo-nium sulphate 1.7 g l
−1,L-asparagine 1 g l−1
and one of the synthesised azo dyes 50 mg l−1)
was used in all biodegradation assays. The ﬁnal
pH was 4.5. The stock solutions of the dyes(100×), YNB (10 ×)a n d
L-asparagine (10 ×)
were ﬁlter sterilised using 0.45 /p109m membranes.
The solid culture media tested to grow the inoc-ula for the experiments, the pre-growth media,were: tap water agar, TWA (agar 15 g l
−1in
tap water); malt extract agar, MEA (malt ex-tract 30 g l
−1, mycological peptone 5 g l−1and
agar 15 g l−1); and pre adaptation medium,
PAM (LCM with S m-g 50 mg l−1and solidi ﬁed
with agar 15 g l−1). TWAcellulose (TWA with a
strip of cellulose paper) was used as an inducermedium of the enzymatic system of the fungus.
3.1.Culture conditions
An 8 mm diameter plug, cut with a sterile
cork borer, from the periphery of a 7-day-oldcolony grown on a TWAcellulose culture plate,was inoculated at the centre of a pre-growthculture plate: TWA, MEA or PAM. Incubationwas carried out for 7 days at 30 °C. For the
biodegradation assays, 100 ml of LCM mediumin 250 ml ﬂasks were inoculated with ﬁve plugs
of 8 mm from the periphery of a pre-growthculture plate. The liquid cultures were incubatedat 30 °C in a Certomat rotary shaker at 150
rpm. Samples were collected every 7 days for atotal of 28 days. Controls were carried out inthe same conditions but without dyes or inocu-lum. Results presented are the mean of at leasttwo independent assays and in all situations,standard deviations were less than 5%.3.2.Biomass concentration
Biomass concentration was determined by dry
weight measurement after drying fungal cells at105°C for 24 h on a 0.45 /p109m pre-weighted
membrane.
3.3.Sucrose concentration
The sucrose concentration was determined by
a colorimetric method, using the Sucrose /D-glu-
cose kit /test from Boehringer Mannheim
(cat.No.139041), reading the absorbance valuesat 340 nm. This kit was used as recommendedby the manufacturer with the following modi ﬁ-
cations —(1) the blank sucrose sample was done
with the sample solution but without the kit en-zyme suspension; (2) a miniaturised procedurewas set up using a 300 /p109l microwell plate in an
ELISA spectrophotometer SLT Spectra; (3) toobtain sucrose concentration, a standard curvewas earlier constructed using the same sugar asstandard. It was established that the initial su-crose concentration present in LCM mediumcorresponded to 100%.
3.4.Dye concentration
The concentration of the dye in the samples
was determined in a spectrophotometer UV /VIS
Jasco 7850 ranging from 250 to 500 nm, by thedecrease of the intensity of the absorption at themaximum wavelength ( /p117
max) of the dye. It was
established that the absorbance value of theLCM medium containing the initial concentra-tion of the dye corresponded to 100% of dye.For these dyes, the absorption spectra are pHvalue dependent. Therefore, buffer solutions ofcitric acid /sodium hydrogenphosphate (Dawson
et al., 1986) of different pH values (3.0 –6.4)
were prepared to select the optimum pH valuein which the intensity of absorbance at /p117
maxwas
higher (pH 4.4). The spectra of the biodegrada-tion assays were obtained from 1 ml of samplesdiluted with 2.5 ml of the appropriate buffersolution.M.A.M.Martins et al ./Journal of Biotechnology 89 (2001) 91 –98 95
4. Results and discussion
In order to select the dye to be used in the
pre-growth medium, PAM, the eight synthesiseddyes were screened using a concentration of 50 mgl
−1.Sm-g was chosen to be one of the dyes where
a clearly fungal decolourisation of the mediumwas observed.
To investigate the optimal conditions for the
biodegradation assays in LCM medium, pre-growth media were tested as source of inoculum:MEA, TWA and PAM. The results (Fig. 2) showthat little biodegradation of S m-g occurred in the
ﬂasks inoculated using MEA (20% at day 14)
whereas in the ﬂasks inoculated using TWA a
signi ﬁcant biodegradation was observed (64% at
day 14). In contrast, the ﬂasks inoculated using
PAM exhibited a strong biodegradation of 75% atday 7, which at day 14 had increased up to 83%.Since the best result, in the biodegradation assayusing LCM with S m-g dye, was obtained with the
fungus pre adapted to PAM, this medium wasused as pre-growth medium in further biodegra-dation assays. From these results, it can be con-cluded that a nutrient rich medium, like MEA, isnot a suitable medium to obtain the inoculum ofthe fungus to biodegrade the azo dyes, even whenit has been earlier maintained and grown in anenzymatic inducer and nutrient poor mediumsuch as TWAcellulose. It is very well establishedthat the fungus P.chrysosporium has the best
enzymatic activity performance under nutrient-limiting conditions, which were the cases of TWAand PAM pre-growth media, as well as LCM usedFig. 3. Effect of different sucrose concentrations on S m-g

in biodegradation assays. We presume that the P.
chrysosporium ligninolytic system is involved in
azo dye biodegradation, and that the S m-g dye
present in PAM would constitute a good adapta-tion medium for the biodegradation of the otherseven dyes.
In preliminary studies, it was observed that for
the initial biodegradation of the synthesised azodyes, an additional carbon source, in our casesucrose, must be present in the culture mediumconﬁrming the results obtained by other authors
(Blondeau, 1989; Morgan et al., 1993). Therefore,three sucrose concentrations (1, 5 and 10 g l
−1)i n
LCM were tested to ﬁnd out the best dye
biodegradation. The results presented in Fig. 3clearly show that 5 g l
−1of sucrose yielded the
highest S m-g biodegradation. Consequently, this
sucrose concentration in the LCM medium wasused in all further experiments.
In the biodegradation assays, a rapid consump-
tion of sucrose with a concomitant increase ofbiomass and decolourisation of the LCM mediumwas generally observed after 7 days of incubation.It was also observed in all experiments that nosigni ﬁcant variation of dye concentration was
caused either by photo-degradation or by dyeadsorption to the biomass since it remainedcolourless during the time of assay. Fig. 4 showsan example of the evolution of the three parame-ters in study during the time course of the C m-s
dye biodegradation assay. During the ﬁrst 7 days
of incubation, an increase of biomass was ob-served, sucrose was totally consumed and theconcentration of the dye decreased to 20%. These

PAM with S m-g dye. C m-s percentage ( /p14), sucrose percent-
age (/p13) and biomass concentration ( /p15).complete sequence obtained from Fig. 5 is: S p-
g/p92Cm-s and C m-g/p92Sm-s/p92Sm-g/p92Cp-s/p92Cp-
g/p92Sp-s. Considering the relationship between
the dye chemical structure and its biodegradabil-ity we suggest these assumptions —(1) compar-
ing C m-s versus C m-g, C p-s versus C p-g and,
Sm-s versus S m-g, syringol is a better coupling
component than guaiacol; (2) comparing C m-s
versus S m-s, C p-s versus S p-s and, C m-g versus
Sm-g the carboxylic group is more adequate
than the sulphonic acid group; (3) comparingCm-s versus C p-s, C m-g versus C p-g and, S m-s
versus S p-smeta -position is better than para -po-
sition. Taking these assumptions into consider-ation, the model chemical structure for an azodye to be easily degraded will be C m-s and, on
the other hand, the chemical structure not rec-ommended will be S p-g. Surprisingly, the latter
was the dye that showed better biodegradationperformance in our assays, followed by the for-mer one.
Since S p-g showed the best biodegradation
performance it was decided to study the possibleinﬂuence of the dye present in the pre-growth
medium PAM on the biodegradation results,comparing the initially selected S m-g dye with a
dye differing in the coupling component, S m-s,
and a dye differing in the acid position, S p-g.
The results presented on Fig. 6 clearly show
that the best S p-g biodegradation was achieved
when P.chrysosporium was pre adapted to a dye
having a sulphonic group in meta -position (S m-
go rS m-s) independently of the coupling com-
ponent nature. Comparing these two dyes it isobserved that, at day 7, the best results for thedata indicate a cometabolic situation followed
by a slight fungal growth at the expense of thedye only. Other authors also found cometabolicpathways in the biodegradation of aromaticcompounds by fungi isolated from contaminatedsoils (Bollag, 1972; Hofrichter et al., 1993), ob-serving also the decrease of these compoundsafter the exhaustion of the cosubstrate used inthe culture medium.
The extent of biodegradation of the eight syn-
thesised dyes using PAM as pre-growth mediumis presented in Fig. 5. High percentages of dyebiodegradation were obtained (80% on average)using dyes either with guaiacol or syringol ascoupling components (Fig. 5). This means thatthe improvement of the bioaccessibility of thedyes, through the design of their chemical struc-tures to incorporate groups present in lignin,was achieved.
The best results of dye biodegradation were
obtained using S p-g (89%), C m-s and C m-g
(88%), S m-s (85%) and, ﬁnally, S m-g (83%). The

is used in PAM medium. This is exclusively dueto the fact that both S m-g in the PAM, and
Sp-g in the LCM, have the same guaiacol cou-
pling component. Finally, when the fungus waspre adapted to S p-g itself, little biodegradation
(30% at day 28 only) was observed (Fig. 6). Thismeans that it is not strictly necessary that thedye present in the PAM should be the same fora successful biodegradation, con ﬁrming that S m-
g is an appropriate dye to be used in the preadaptation of the fungus, even for dyes havingthe sulphonic acid group in para -position. From
these results, we can conclude that biodegrada-tion of these dyes is also dependent on the dyestructure present in the pre-growth medium.
As a ﬁnal conclusion, the results show a rela-
tionship between the extent of biodegradationand the chemical structure of the dyes either tobe degraded or to be used in the pre-growthmedium. To improve the knowledge about thisrelationship, additional work has been done inour laboratory (data to be published).
