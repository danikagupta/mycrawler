Water use in textile industry  
•The textile industry is estimated to consume 79 billion cubic metres fresh 
water along the whole value chain (House of Commons UK 2019, p. 29)
•It is said that the production of a cotton t -shirt consumes 2700 litres 
of water (The Conscious Challenge 2019)
•The production of a pair of jeans consumes on average 10 000 litres of 
water (BBC 2023)
•The production of clothing, footwear and household textiles that a European 
citizen (EU -27) buys annually requires 9 cubic metres of blue water
•Additionally , cotton production for the EU -27 market requires 20 
billion cubic metres of green water annually (European 
Environmental Agency 2023)

data from  different  yearsFig. 1: Blue , green  and grey  water  definitions.•In general, most water is used in the textile dyeing and finishing in the textile industry 
(Körlü 2019) but there are differences between the different fibres. It is also estimated 
that fibre production, followed by dyeing & finishing and yarn preparation withdraw 
the most freshwater in the apparel industry ( Quantis 2018).
•Water is used as a medium in e.g., dyeing and finishing, as a washing -off agent, and as 
generation of heat and steam for the process baths in the textile industry (Saxena et 
al. 2017)
•Fashion industry produces 20 % of the global wastewater (UN News 2019), and the 
annual clothing production is estimated to increase from 109 million tons (2020) to 145 
millions in 2030 (European Parliament 2023).

Average water consumption of a European citizen (L/day)•For mechanical recycling; the water consumption during the recycling processes is low , although it is expected that the waste textiles coming to the recycling 
factory so that the recycling process can run smoothly.
•Water may be used for lubrication, anti -static treatment etc.
•The greatest freshwater use and wastewater issues are identified for chemical recycling
•For cellulosic materials: for a successful chemical recycling, water is necessary in multiple steps. Pre -treatments, baths and w ashing between stages are the 
most water consuming stages of chemical recycling
•For synthetics: synthetics are made of petrochemicals, and they produce microfibres. The most water is used in washing of the recycled PET.
•It has been reported cellulose carbamate (CCA) production using discarded textiles consumes only 2 % of the water needed for cotton production, or 25% of 
the water needed for viscose production . The same mills may be used for CCA processing as for viscose processes (Paunonen et al. 2019)
•The CCA regeneration can use up to 86 litres of water per produced kg of fibre. If the CCA spinning mill is integrated into the pulp mill, water use may be 
decreased to 31 litres (Paunonen et al. 2019)Fresh water use and wastewater concerns in 
recycling processesChemical concerns of textile industry
•While it takes 2700L of water to produce one cotton t -shirt, it takes approximately 3 kg of 
chemicals to produce 1 kg of cotton shirts (Swedish Chemicals Agency 2014)
•The footwear and apparel industry is estimated to use 8000 different chemicals and 10 000 
different dyes (Chequer et al. 2013, van Dulmen et al. 2023)
•There are at least 281 hazardous agents and chemicals used in the textile fibre and 
fabric manufacturing (Haz -Map 2023a) and 562 in wet processes (Haz -Map 2023b).
•The chemicals used in textiles can be divided into three main groups; the functional chemical 
substances, the auxiliary chemical substances and the unintended chemical substances 
(Swedish Chemicals Agency 2014).
•The textile industry uses detergents, sizing agents, oils, latex, glues, dyes, fixing agents, and 
other special chemicals used as softeners, wetting agents, etc. ( Zaharia & Suteu 2012)

Fig. 4: The most  important  wastewater  purity  
parameters  in textile  industry  (Hessel  et al. 2007)Fibre production in general
•Onaverage, a produced kilogram of cotton fabric requires 5961.7 kg water, with the range of 0 kg to 29 
tonnes. 73% of global cotton fields are irrigated. ( Picoli et al. 2023). Water consumption in cotton cultivation 
and in the cultivation of any natural fibres is greatly impacted by the geographic area and its rainfall, and the 
desired fibre ( Chapagain et al. 2006).
•Cotton has a greater water footprint than many of the other natural fibre crops. For example, the 
hemp crop water footprint is estimated to be at 2002 litres of water per produced kilogram (Wise et 
al. 2023) and no irrigation is necessary if rainfall is adequate ( Rissanen et al. 2022)
•Synthetics are produced by three main methods: melt spinning, dry spinning and wet spinning
•A wastewater contaminant directly related to synthetic textiles are microplastics (ECHA 2023)
•Wet spinning is used for the fibres/polymers that cannot be melted or which are not soluble in 
solvents that can be evaporated (dry spinning). Wet spinning involves a coagulation bath in which 
the polymer solution comes out as a gel -like filaments. (Mather & Wardman 2015)
•The viscose process is a chemically loaded process with the greatest ecotoxicity impact coming from the 
sulfuric acid and zinc sulfate used in the coagulation bath (Guo et al. 2021) The main water consumption of 
MMCF derives from the cooling water (90 -95%). The process water only accounts for 5 -10%.
•In lyocell process, the dissolvent (NMMO) can be recycled within the process up to 99.5 % (Mather 
and Wardman 2015). Guo et al. (2021) found that the process of producing 1 ton of viscose results 
in 61 tons of wastewater, while lyocell process leaves 20 tons of wastewater . 
•The exhaust gases of viscose processes include steam, carbon disulfide and hydrogen sulfide . For 
lyocell process, the exhaust gases comprise mostly of water steam (Guo et al. 2021)

•Textile wet processes consume approximately 60 to 90 % of the total water used in 
textile processes . This is due to the effective rinsing of chemical agents between the 
different stages ( Jovančić & Radetić 2008 )
•De-sizing and scouring are estimated to be the most chemical polluting wastewater 
stages of textile wet processes ( Jovančić & Radetić 2008 )
•Different surfactants are used in wet processes to make the production and 
manufacturing of textiles more efficient. Alkylphenol ethoxylates (APEO’s) are a 
common type of surfactants , that can be used in many pre -treatments, e.g. scouring, in 
lubrication, dyeing and printing, and finishing treatments (PCC Group 2023, Khan et al. 
2023)
•APEO’s pose potential health risks and environmental risks. Nonylphenol 
ethoxylates (NPEs/NPEOs) are one of the most widely used APEOs. The use of 
NPE’s has been restricted in EU since 2006 by REACH. (Chem -MAP 2019). NPE’s 
degrade into nonylphenols, that are toxic, bio -accumulative and persistent

Zaharia  & Suteu  2012). Dyeing
•First synthetic dye was discovered in 1856. From then, most dyes used in the industry are synthetic. The dyes are 
often also toxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic, and the discoloured effluent causes problems in blocking the sunlight 
from reaching the aquatic life (Zaharia & Suteu 2012, Zaharia et al. 2009, Hessel et al. 2007).
•Textile dyeing involves many chemicals ; the dyes and pigments and added organic and inorganic substances to 
facilitate the easier colouring . Moreover, the wastewater of dyeing effluent must be controlled in terms of e.g., pH 
due to difficulties in conventional wastewater treatment processes. ( Zaharia et al. 2009)
•The dye effluents contain heavy metals , such as cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), cadmium (Cd), iron (Fe), 
lead (Pb), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni) and zinc (Zn) that facilitate the dying but pose risks to human and the 
environment (Khan et al. 2023, Uddin 2021).

Jovančić & Radetić 2008 ). •Water is used in pre -treatments, pre -washing, dissolution, depolymerisation, separation of catalysts, 
spinning and post -washing of chemically recycled fibres
•Cellulose recycling
•Pre-treatment: Manipulation of DP , viscosity and metal and impurities removal. Haslinger et al . 
(2019) describe a pre -treatment process consisting of alkali washing state, ozone and hydrogen 
peroxide baths, acid washing and disk refining . Often used pre -treatment is an aqueous NaOH 
solution, washed off with distilled water (Ma et al. 2019)
•Dissolution of cellulose can be done with NaOH, NaOH with CS2 , N2O4 with DMF, PF with DMSO, 
Cu with amine, LiCl with DMAc, NMMO, ionic liquid (IL), IL with DMSO, or alkali with urea (Li et al. 
2021, Ma et al. 2019)
•The cotton regeneration is most often done with wet spinning and dry -wet jet spinning ( Asaadi et al. 
2016). Coagulation baths can contain only water (Sun et al. 2021, Haslinger et al. 2019), or water 
with different concentrations of H2SO4 and Na2 SO4 (Li et al. 2021), 
•Polyester recycling
•The chemical recycling of polyester (polyethylene terephthalate, PET) is carried through 
depolymerisation. It can be done with alcoholysis , acid hydrolysis, alkaline hydrolysis 
(saponification, acidification), neutral hydrolysis (esterification), aminolysis , ammonolysis and 
glycolysis 
Chemical recycling in general

•The textile wastewater treatments consist of primary, secondary and tertiary treatments. The primary treatment removes the solids, the secondary treatment 
decomposes the bacteria, and the tertiary treatment serves as an extra filtration (LibreTexts 2023). Depending on the effluent, different treatments are used.
• The different technologies can be divided into 4 categories; biological, physical, advanced chemical technologies, and their combinations.Biological  treatments•Aerobic biological

Fig. 10: The textile  wastewater  treatment  processes  can be divided  into four  categories , with  respective  examples  (Ahsan  et al. 2023, Kumari  et al. 2023).•The textile industry uses majority of its water in processing (90 -96 %), and the rest (6 -10 %) in cooling . The amount of water used in processing is great 
compared to chemical industry, where approximately 20 % of the water is used in processing and the rest (80%) in cooling ( Zaharia & Suteu 2012)
•The textile wastewater is characterised by the presence of inorganic persistent pollutants (European Environment Agency 2018), high COD, BOD, and 
presence of matter, oil and grease (Pensupa et al. 2017). To be removed from/treated in textile wastewater include (Zaharia & Suteu 2012):
•Colour ; this is done by de -colourization using biological and advanced non -biological methods. There is scarcity of data in how succes sful it is, and for 
example bright water -soluble reactive dyes are difficult to remove. Tertiary treatment is often necessary with organic dyes 
•Differentiating pH values, salts, oxidants ; inorganic pollutants that are relatively easy to remove
•Starches, natural oils and waxes, biodegradable surfactants ; easily biodegradable
•Colourants, whitening agents ; difficult to biodegrade
•Polyvinyl alcohols, mineral oils ; difficult to biodegrade
•Retarders, heavy metals, formaldehyde, etc. ; cannot be removed by biological treatmentWastewater treatments in textile industryEU Regulation
•Drinking water directive , Directive (EU) 2020/2184 of the European 
Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2020 on the quality of water 
intended for human consumption
•The main goals of the directive are to improve or maintain the 
quality of water, conclude a risk assessment/management and 
improve access to clean drinking water (European Commission 
2024).
•Article 25 states that from 12thJanuary 2026, the Member states 
must ensure the following substances do not exceed the limits in 
drinking water meant for human consumption: Bisphenol  A (2.5 
μg/l), Chlorate  (0.25 mg/l), Chlorite  (0,25 mg/l), Haloacetic  Acids  (60 
μg/l), Microcystin -LR (1.0 μg/l), PFAS Total (0.5 μg/l), Sum  of PFAS 
(0.1 μg/) and Uranium  (30 μg/l).
•Beta -estradiol  and nonylphenol  added  to the first watch  list in 
January  2022 due to their  endoctrine  disruptance  and the risk they  
pose  to human  health , as described  in article  13 of Directive (EU) 
2020/2184 and later  in Decision  (EU) 2022/679
•The directive  will also follow  up on the microplastics  by ”adopting a 
methodology to measure microplastics with a view to including them 
on the watch list” and follow the risks microplastics pose to human 
health through drinking water
•Water Framework Directive (WFD) , Directive 2000/60/EC of the European 
Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2000 establishing a framework 
for Community action in the field of water policy
•In force since 2000, the main law for water protection. In 2022, it 
was proposed to revise the list of pollutants
•Supported by two daughter directives; one for the quality and 
quantity of groundwater and another one for the quality of surface 
water.
•River basin management plans are mandatory for the Member states 
as described in Article 4, this means protection and restoring of the 
water bodies, maintaining a good ecological and chemical status
•POPs Regulation , Regulation (EU) 2019/1021 of the European Parliament 
and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on persistent organic pollutants
•Amendment of Annex IV: care must be taken in disposal and 
management of waste containing or contaminated by added 
substances
•For textiles, the greatest concerns are with perfluorooctanoic acid 
(PFOA) and its salts and related compounds, polybrominated 
diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD) and 
perfluorohexanesulfonic acid ( PFHxS ) and its salts and related 
compounds .•United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6 aims to ensure clean drinking water and 
sanitation for all by 2030.
•2 billion people lack safe drinking water . While 44% of household wastewater is not safely 
treated, there is insufficient data regarding the safety of industrial wastewater treatment 
(United Nations 2021)
•Global access to safe drinking water has been increasing from 2015 to 2021, but the pace 
needs to be accelerated to reach the goal of safe drinking water by 2030 (WHO 2021)
UN Drinking water goal

•Most water in textile production is used in processing, 90 -96 %, and approximately 65 % of that is used in textile dyeing, print ing and finishing
•Textile effluent is described by high alkali or acidic pH, vibrant colour, high COD, high BOD and presence of metals and othe r impurities
•Wastewater treatments include physical, chemical and biological methods, as well as their combinations
•Primary, secondary, and tertiary treatments are used when necessary
•Legislation and restricted substance lists aim at eliminating or limiting certain chemicals from ending up in drinking water or in groundwater
