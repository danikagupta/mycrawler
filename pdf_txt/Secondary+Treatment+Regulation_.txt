   (1) For a given pollutant parameter, the 95th percentile value for the 30 -day average effluent quality 
achieved by a treatment works in a period of at least two  years, excluding values attributable to upsets, 
bypasses, operational errors, or other unusual conditions, and  
 
   (2) A 7 -day average value equal to 1.5 times the value derived under paragraph (f)(1) of this section.  
 
  (f) “Facilities eligible for treat ment equivalent to secondary treatment.” Treatment works shall be 
eligible for consideration for effluent limitations described for treatment equivalent to secondary treatment 
(section 133.105), if:  
 
   (1) The BOD 5 and TSS effluent concentrations consiste ntly achievable through proper operation 
and maintenance (section 133.101(f) of the treatment works exceed the minimum level of the effluent 
quality set forth in section 133.102(a) and section 133.102(b).

percent removal requirements of at least 5 mg/l more stringent than the otherwise applicable concentration -
based limitations (e.g., less than 25 mg/l in the case  of the secondary treatment limits for BOD 5 and TSS), 
or the percent removal limitations in section 133.102 and section 133.105, if such limits would, by 
themselves, force significant construction or other significant capital expenditure.  
 
  (k) “TSS.” The  pollutant parameter total suspended solids.  
 
133.102 . Secondary treatment.  
 
 The following paragraphs describe the minimum level of effluent quality (in NPDES permits) attainable 
by secondary treatment in terms of the parameters - BOD 5, TSS and pH. All re quirements for each 
parameter shall be achieved except as provided for in section 133.103 and section 133.105.  
 
  (a) BOD 5. 
 
   (1) The 30 -day average shall not exceed 30 mg/l.  
 
   (2) The 7 -day average shall not exceed 45 mg/l.  
 
   (3) The 30 -day average percent removal shall not be less than 85 percent.  
 
   (4) At the option of the NPDES permitting authority, in lieu of the parameter BOD 5 and the levels 
of the effluent quality specified in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2) and (a)(3), the parameter CBOD 5 may be 
substituted with the following levels of the CBOD 5 effluent quality provided:  
 
    (i) The 30 -day average shall not exceed 25 mg/l.  
 
    (ii) The 7 -day average shall not exceed 40 mg/l.  
 
    (iii) The 30 -day average percent removal shall not be less than 85 percent.  
 
  (b) TSS.  
 
   (1) The 30 -day average shall not exceed 30 mg/l.  
 
   (2) The 7 -day average shall not exceed 45 mg/l.  
 
   (3) The 30 -day average percent removal shall not be less than 85 percent.  
 
  (c) pH. The effluent values for pH shall be maintained within the limits of 6.0 to 9.0 unless the publicly 
owned treatment works demonstrates that:  
 
   (1) Inorganic chemicals are not added to the waste stream as part of the treatment process; and  
 
   (2) Contributions from industrial sources do not cause the pH of the effluent to be less than 6.0 or 
greater than 9.0.  
 196 | Regulation 61 -9.133 
 133.103 . Special considerations.  
 
 (a) Combined sewers. Treatment works subject to this part may not be capable of meeting the percentage 
removal requirements established under sect ion 133.102(a)(3) and section 133.102(b)(3), or section 
133.105(a)(3) and section 133.105(b)(3) during wet weather where the treatment works receive flows from 
combined sewers (i.e., sewers which are designed to transport both storm water and sanitary sewa ge). For 
such treatment works, the decisions must be made on a case -by-case basis as to whether any attainable 
percentage removal level can be defined, and if so, what the level should be.  
 
 (b) Industrial wastes. For certain industrial categories, the dis charge to waters of the State of BOD 5 and 
TSS permitted under sections 301(b)(1)(A)(i), (b)(2)(E) or 306 of the CWA may be less stringent than the 
values given in section 133.102(a)(1), section 133.102(a)(4)(i), section 133.102(b)(1), section 
133.105(a)(1) , section 133.105(b)(1) and section 133.105(e)(1)(i). In cases when wastes would be 
introduced from such an industrial category into a publicly owned treatment works, the values for BOD 5 
and TSS in section 133.102(a)(1), section 133.102(a)(4)(i), section 1 33.102(b)(1), section 133.105(a)(1), 
section 133.105(b)(1), and section 133.105(e)(1)(i) may be adjusted upwards provided that:  
 
  (1) The permitted discharge of such pollutants, attributable to the industrial category, would not be 
greater than that which  would be permitted under sections 301(b)(1)(A)(i), 301(b)(2)(E) or 306 of the CWA 
if such industrial category were to discharge directly into the waters of the State, and  
 
  (2) The flow or loading of such pollutants introduced by the industrial category exceeds 10 percent of 
the design flow or loading of the publicly owned treatment works. When such an adjustment is made, the 
values for BOD 5 or TSS in section 133.102(a)(2), section 133.102(a)(4)(ii), section 133.102(b)(2), section 
133.105(a)(2), section 133.105(b)(2), and section 133.105(e)(1)(ii) shall be adjusted proportionately.  
 
 (c) Waste stabilization ponds.  
 
  (1) The Department, is authorized to adjust the minimum level of effluent quality set forth in section 
133.105(b)(1), (b)(2), and (b )(3) for treatment works subject to this part, to conform to the suspended solids 
concentrations achievable with waste stabilization ponds, provided that:  
 
   (A) Waste stabilization ponds including aerated lagoon systems are the principal process used for  
secondary treatment; and  
 
   (B) Operation and maintenance data indicate that the TSS values specified in section 133.105(b)(1), 
(b)(2), and (b)(3) cannot be achieved.  
 
  (2)(A) The term “TSS concentrations achievable with waste stabilization ponds” means  a TSS value, 
determined by the Regional Administrator or the Department, subject to EPA approval, which is equal to 
the effluent concentration achieved 90 percent of the time within a State or appropriate contiguous 
geographical area by waste stabilizatio n ponds that are achieving the levels of effluent quality for BOD 5 
specified in section 133.105(a)(1).  
 
   (B) Allowable limits:  
 
    (i) The 30 -day average shall not exceed 90 mg/l.  
 
    (ii) The 7 -day average shall not exceed 135 mg/l.  
 197 | Regulation 61 -9.133 
  (d) Less concentrated influent wastewater for separate sewers. The Department may substitute either a 
lower percent removal requirement or a mass loading limit for the percent removal requirements set forth 
in section 133.102(a)(3), section 133.102(a)(4)(iii), sect ion 133.102(b)(3), section 133.105(a)(3), section 
133.105(b)(3) and section 133.105(e)(1)(iii) provided that the permittee satisfactorily demonstrates that:  
 
  (1) The treatment works is consistently meeting, or will consistently meet, its permit effluent 
concentration limits but its percent removal requirements cannot be met due to less concentrated influent 
wastewater,  
 
  (2) To meet the percent removal requirements, the treatment works would have to achieve significantly 
more stringent limitations than w ould otherwise be required by the concentration -based standard, and  
 
  (3) The less concentrated influent wastewater is not the result of excessive I/I. The determination of 
whether the less concentrated wastewater is the result of excessive I/I will use the definition of excessive 
I/I in 40 CFR 35.2005(b)(16) plus the additi onal criterion that inflow is non -excessive if the total flow to 
the POTW (i.e., wastewater plus inflow plus infiltration) is less than 275 gallons per capita per day.  
 
 (e) Less concentrated influent wastewater for combined sewers during dry weather. The Department, 
subject to EPA approval, is authorized to substitute either a lower percent removal requirement or a mass 
loading limit for the percent removal requirements set forth in section 133.102(a)(3), section 
133.102(a)(4(iii), section 133.102(b)(3), s ection 133.105(a)(3), section 133.105(b)(3) and section 
133.105(e)(1)(iii) provided that the permittee satisfactorily demonstrates that:  
 
  (1) The treatment works is consistently meeting, or will consistently meet, its permit effluent 
concentration limits , but the percent removal requirements cannot be met due to less concentrated influent 
wastewater;  
 
  (2) To meet the percent removal requirements, the treatment works would have to achieve significantly 
more stringent effluent concentrations than would ot herwise be required by the concentration -based 
standards; and  
 
  (3) The less concentrated influent wastewater does not result from either excessive infiltration or clear 
water industrial discharges during dry weather periods. If the less concentrated infl uent wastewater is the 
result of clear water industrial discharges, then the treatment works must control such discharges pursuant 
to R.61 -9.403.  
 
133.104 . Sampling and test procedures.  
 
 (a) Sampling and test procedures for pollutants listed in this part shall be in accordance with test methods 
set forth in 40 CFR Part 136.  
 
 (b) Chemical oxygen demand (COD) or total organic carbon (TOC) may be substituted for BOD 5 when 
a long -term BOD:COD or BOD:TOC correlation has been demonstrated.  
 
133.105 . Treatment e quivalent to secondary treatment.  
 
 This section describes the minimum level of effluent quality (in NPDES permits) attainable by facilities 
eligible for treatment equivalent to secondary treatment (section 133.101(g)) in terms of the parameters - 
BOD 5, TSS and pH. All requirements for the specified parameters in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this 
section shall be achieved except as provided for in section 133.103, or paragraphs (d), (e) or (f) of this 
section.  198 | Regulation 61 -9.133 
  
  (a) BOD 5. 
 
   (1) The 30 -day average shall not exceed 45 mg/l.  
 
   (2) The 7 -day average shall not exceed 65 mg/l.  
 
   (3) The 30 -day average percent removal shall not be less than 65 percent.  
 
  (b) TSS. Except where TSS values have been adjusted in accordance with section 133.103(c) . 
 
   (1) The 30 -day average shall not exceed 45 mg/l.  
 
   (2) The 7 -day average shall not exceed 65 mg/l.  
 
   (3) The 30 -day average percent removal shall not be less than 65 percent.  
 
  (c) pH. The requirements of section 133.102(c) shall be met.  
 
  (d) Alternative State requirements. Except as limited by paragraph (f) of this section, the Department 
may adjust the minimum levels of effluent quality set forth in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), (b)(1) and (b)(2) of 
this section for trickling filter facilities a nd in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section for waste 
stabilization pond facilities, to conform to the BOD 5 and TSS effluent concentrations consistently 
achievable through proper operation and maintenance (section 133.101(f)) by the median (50th per centile) 
facility in a representative sample of facilities within the State or appropriate contiguous geographical area 
that meet the definition of facilities eligible for treatment equivalent to secondary treatment (section 
133.101(g)).  
 
  (e) CBOD 5 limit ations:  
 
   (1) Where data are available to establish CBOD 5 limitations for a treatment works subject to this 
section, the Department may substitute the parameter CBOD 5 for the parameter BOD 5 in section 
133.105(a)(1), section 133.105(a)(2) and section 133.105(a)(3), on a case -by-case basis provided that the 
levels  of CBOD 5 effluent quality are not less stringent than the following:  
 
    (i) The 30 -day average shall not exceed 40 mg/l.  
 
    (ii) The 7 -day average shall not exceed 60 mg/l.  
 
    (iii) The 30 -day average percent removal shall not be less than 65 percent.  
 
   (2) Where data are available, the parameter CBOD 5 may be used for effluent quality limitations 
established under paragraph (d) of this section. Where concurrent BOD effluent data are available, they 
must be submitted with the CBOD data as a pa rt of the approval process outlined in paragraph (d) of this 
section.  
  (f) Permit adjustments. Any NPDES permit adjustment made pursuant to this part may not be any less 
stringent than the limitations required pursuant to section 133.105(a) -(e). Furthermo re, the Department shall 
require more stringent limitations when adjusting permits if:  
 
   (1) For existing facilities the Department determines that the 30 -day average and 7 -day average 
BOD 5 and TSS effluent values that could be achievable through proper operation and maintenance of the 199 | Regulation 61 -9.133 
 treatment works, based on an analysis of the past performance of the treatment works, would enable the 
treatment works to achieve more stringent limitations, or  
 
   (2) For new facilities, the Department determines that the  30-day average and 7 -day average BOD 5 
and TSS effluent values that could be achievable through proper operation and maintenance of the treatment 
works, considering the design capability of the treatment process and geographical and climatic conditions, 
would enable the treatment works to achieve more stringent limitations.
