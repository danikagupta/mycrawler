INTRODUCTION
Benthic microalgae, also termed microphytobenthos,
are ubiquitous in subtidal and intertidal estuarinesediments. They live in the upper few millimeters ofthe sediment in shallow ecosystems and exhibit dielvertical migration within this layer. Benthic microalgaeplay a number of important roles in estuarine ecosys-tems. They produce extracellular polymeric substancesthat are an important carbon source for bacteria andgrazers, and aid in the stabilization of sediments (Wolf-stein & Stal 2002). This sediment stabilization helps to
reduce resuspension and thus the erosion of estuarinebottoms (Miller et al. 1996). Benthic microalgae arealso intermediaries in many biogeochemical processesin estuaries, and thus important components of sedi-ment carbon and nutrient cycling and exchange withthe water column (Baillie 1986, Rizzo et al. 1992). Fur-ther, benthic microalgae have been shown to con-tribute significantly to the total primary production ofestuaries (de Jonge 1992, MacIntyre & Cullen 1995) inview of the large area they normally cover (i.e. sedi-

ABSTRACT: The impact of anthropogenic eutrophication on the productivity and metabolism ofestuarine sediments has received relatively little attention. In this study, we investigated the separateand combined effects of decreased light availability and sediment nutrient enrichment, 2 of the mostimportant impacts of anthropogenic eutrophication, on sediment primary production and metabolismin 2 eutrophic subestuaries of Weeks Bay (Alabama, USA), seasonally, over a year. We found a signif-icant effect of shading on both sediment primary production and metabolism, mostly due to decreasedphotosynthetic rates of benthic microalgae coupled with simultaneous increases in sediment respira-tion rates. The ratio of mean production in non-shaded plots to that in shaded plots was close to 1 andtended to occur at natural bottom light intensities <100 µmol m
–2s–1during the summer experiments,
whereas higher light intensities tended to increase the ratio (i.e. higher values under non-shaded con-ditions). The ratio tended to decrease and become closer to 1 at the highest values of light intensityrecorded (>600 µmol photons m
–2s–1). Nutrient enrichment had little effect on sediment primary pro-
duction and metabolism in the estuarine sites studied; however, in some instances nutrient enrichmentinfluenced the negative effects of reduced light on sediment net production. The results demonstratethat the impact of light reduction on sediment primary production and metabolism in a turbid,nutrient-rich estuary is greater than that of additional sediment nutrient enrichment.

ment flats) and their significant areal productivity rates
(in g C m–2h–1). Indeed, several studies have docu-
mented that in shallow estuarine environments ben-thic microalgae can achieve areal productivity ratesthat are at least 20% that of phytoplankton (Daehnicket al. 1992, Moncreiff et al. 1992, Schreiber & Pennock1995) and at least 25% that of macrophytes andepiphytes (Moncreiff et al. 1992). Because of their highcontribution to total estuarine primary production,benthic microalgae are also important trophic resour-ces for many local and external consumers (Middel-burg et al. 2000, Carman & Fry 2002).
As a result of the increasing occupation of coastal
watersheds by humans, the discharge of nutrients intocoastal waters is also increasing (Nixon 1995, Howarthet al. 2002). This process, known as anthropogeniceutrophication of coastal ecosystems, is one of the mostpervasive worldwide environmental impacts imposedby humans (NRC 1994, Jackson et al. 2000, Tilman etal. 2001), and its effects on the biota of coastal eco-systems have received considerable attention. Forinstance, it is well known that increased nutrient load-ing often leads to blooms of phytoplankton and/or fila-mentous benthic macroalgae (e.g. reviews by Duarte1995, Borum & Sand-Jensen 1996, Cloern 2001) which,in turn, may exert a series of positive (e.g. enhancedrefuge, food and recruitment) and negative (e.g.anoxia, predator attraction, high sulfide concentra-tions) impacts on benthic infauna (e.g. Rafaelli et al.1998, Norkko et al. 2000, Franz & Friedman 2002). Theeffects on other benthic macrophytes, such as sea-grasses and large bulky macroalgae, are often nega-tive and include anoxia (Sfriso et al. 1992, Krause-Jensen et al. 1999), adverse biogeochemical conditions(Van Katwijk et al. 1997) and light limitation (Short etal. 1995, Hauxwell et al. 2001), which may involve sub-stantial loss of these macrophytes (Silberstein et al.1986, Short & Wyllie-Echeverria 1996, Hauxwell et al.2003). Nevertheless, relatively little research has beendone on the effects of eutrophication on the primaryproduction and metabolism of sediments inhabited bymicroalgae (Barranguet et al. 1998, Hillebrand & Som-mer 2000a,b, Hillebrand et al. 2002). This is an impor-tant aspect in view of the worldwide occurrence andpersistence of eutrophication and of the numerousimportant ecological roles of benthic microalgae.
Anthropogenic eutrophication may involve positive
and/or negative effects on benthic microalgal com-munities depending on (inter alia), the interactionbetween nutrients and light availability during andfollowing increased nutrient loads. For instance, inshallow, well-illuminated sediments, where nutrientlimitation of microalgal growth occurs, higher anthro-pogenically induced nutrient loads could stimulatebenthic primary production if light availability at thesediment surface remains high. Research in the Baltic
Sea has shown that microphytobenthic biomassincreases after nutrient enrichment under conditions ofhigh irradiance (Hillebrand et al. 2000). Dizon & Yap(1999) found that the biomass and photosynthetic yieldof coral reef microphytobenthic communities also in-creased with elevated levels of nitrogen and phos-phorus input. Conversely, in nutrient-rich, turbidestuaries where light limitation of microphytobenthicgrowth frequently occurs, higher water-column atten-uation and decreased light availability at the bottomresulting from eutrophication should have a greatereffect on benthic primary production than increasednutrient availability. Meyercordt & Meyer-Reil (1999)compared microphytobenthic primary production in ahighly eutrophied and turbid coastal lagoon with thatin a moderately eutrophied coastal lagoon, andshowed that light limitation in the highly eutrophiedlagoon was detrimental to microphytobenthic primaryproduction.
The objective of the present research was to deter-
mine the separate and combined effects of sedimentnutrient enrichment and decreased light availability(2 of the most important processes that often accom-pany anthropogenic eutrophication) on sediment pri-mary production and metabolism at 2 nutrient-rich,turbid estuarine sites within Weeks Bay (Alabama,USA). We hypothesized that further enrichment of thealready nutrient-rich sediment would have little effecton primary production and metabolism, whereas de-creased light availability would have a considerablynegative impact. This research contributes to ourunderstanding of how further increases in nutrientavailability and reductions in light availability wouldaffect eutrophic estuarine benthic systems, and pro-vides information useful for environmental manage-ment of these systems.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study sites. Weeks Bay is a small estuarine embay-
ment on the eastern shore of Mobile Bay, Alabama(Fig. 1). The embayment is shallow (mean water depth= 1.4 m) and has a small tidal range of 0.3 to 0.5 m.Weeks Bay is fed primarily by the Fish River from thenorth and the Magnolia River from the east, althoughthere are several smaller tidal streams that drain intothe bay. Following intense rainfall, freshets canreplace the water within the bay within 2 to 3 d,although the water is normally renewed every 3 dthrough tidal forcing (Schroeder et al. 1990, 1992).Thus, the salinity of Weeks Bay is strongly controlledby the Mobile River system, and to a lesser extent bythe Weeks Bay watershed. The sediments are a mix-

ture of clay and silt, with a surface layer mainly com-
prised of sandy clay loam and organic soil (Haywick etal. unpubl. data).
Studies were conducted at 2 sites within the bay
between October 2002 and July 2003. The first site(Magnolia) was on the SE shoreline near the mouth ofthe Magnolia River, and the second (Reserve) was onthe NW shoreline within a smaller embayment of theestuary (Fig. 1). Both intertidal regions were domi-nated by the cordgrass Spartina alterniflora Loisel and
S. cynosuroides (L.) Roth, and the black needlerush
Juncus roemerianus Scheele. The sediments at Mag-
nolia were mainly composed of sand, while those atReserve were dominated by organic unconsolidatedmud, despite some seasonal variability in sedimentcomposition in both sites.
Weeks Bay is characterized by a turbid water column
arising from high concentrations of suspended sedi-ments resulting from resuspension during wind events,discharge from the Fish and Magnolia Rivers, as wellas tidal inputs from Mobile Bay (Miller-Way et al.1996). Schreiber & Pennock (1995) reported high levelsof light extinction in the water column of Weeks Bay,with attenuation coefficients ranging between 1 and7.5 m
–1. In addition, a 4 yr series of surveys by Pennock
et al. (2001) showed that nutrient concentrations in thewater column of Weeks Bay are generally higher thanin many other estuarine systems (Cebrian & Valiela1999). Furthermore, preliminary measurements indi-cated that sediment porewater nutrient concentrationsare higher than in other systems (Worm et al. 2000).
At both sites, all experiments were conducted on
bare subtidal sediments. Water depth varied withseason and site, from 0.1 m in winter to 1.2 m inspring/summer at Magnolia and from 0.2 m in fall/winter to 0.8 m in spring/summer at Reserve. Themicrophytobenthic community of the sites is domina-ted by several diatom genera: Achnanthes, Amphora,
Navicula, Nitzschia and Pleurosira (S. Phipps pers.
comm.). Polychaetes, such as Hobsonia florida ,
Laeonereris culveri and Eteone , comprise the most
abundant group of macrofauna in the sediment(Miller-Way et al. 1996). Due to considerable andfrequent resuspension, benthic diatoms are also oftenpresent in the water-column (S. Phipps pers. comm.),along with pelagic diatoms, several species of rotifersand copepods, numerous commercially importantfishes, and invertebrates such as blue crabs andpenaeid shrimps (Miller-Way et al. 1996).
Experimental design. The effects of sediment light-
availability (i.e. shading) and nutrient enrichment onsediment primary production and metabolism weretested seasonally (in October 2002, February 2003,May 2003 and July 2003) at the 2 study sites. Experi-mental plots were 1 m
2PVC frames placed 30 ± 2 cmabove the sediment surface; 10 of these frames were
covered with a black shade cloth (Aquacenter), while10 remained uncovered. The shade cloth reduced lightintensity at the sediment surface by about 50% com-pared to unshaded conditions. The cloths were cleanedcarefully by hand throughout each experiment to min-imize any increase in shading from build-up of mudand detritus on the cloth. Furthermore, the sedimentunder 10 of the frames (5 shaded and 5 unshaded) wasenriched several times throughout the experiment (seenext subsection). Therefore, each experiment involveda 2-factorial manipulation with 4 treatments: (1) nat-ural light and nutrient availability, (2) reduced lightand natural nutrient availability, (3) natural light andenhanced nutrient availability and (4) reduced lightand enhanced nutrient availability. Each treatmenthad 5 replicates (i.e. five 1 m
2frames). Replicates of the
4 treatments were grouped into 5 rows, with each rowcontaining 1 replicate of each treatment randomlylocated within the row. Adjacent plots (both within andacross rows) were 1.5 m apart. This design minimizedthe impact of unknown environmental heterogeneityon our results (Sokal & Rohlf 1995, Quinn & Keough2002). Each experiment was run for 6 d.
Sediment nutrient enrichment. Prior to starting our
experiments in fall 2002, we measured ambient nitro-gen and phosphorus concentrations in the sedimentporewater of the 2 study sites (see next subsection). Foreach site, and based on the ambient porewater concen-trations and information on sediment density and pore-water content, we calculated a nitrogen addition perplot that represented a 70 ×increase relative to the
average ambient concentration. Then, using the esti-31

mated porewater nitrogen concentration in the fertil-
ized plots and the average ambient phosphorus con-centration in the porewater, we calculated the quantityof phosphorus required to be added to each plot ateach site such that the final concentrations in the sedi-ment porewater immediately after fertilization wouldapproximate the 17:1 nitrogen:phosphorus molar ratiocorresponding to the internal ratio of microphytoben-thos (Hillebrand & Sommer 1999). Because ambientnitrogen:phosphorus molar ratios in the sedimentporewater were much greater than 17:1, phosphorusaddition represented a more than 70 ×increase relative
to ambient concentrations (i.e. 150 ×at Magnolia and
400 ×at Reserve). Final values were 3.15 g N and
0.445 g P per plot at Magnolia and 4.47 g N and 0.66 gP per plot at Reserve each time nutrients were added inthe fall experiments. Nutrient additions were made onDays 0 and 2 during these experiments. This fertiliza-tion procedure was intended to maintain elevated, sto-ichiometrically-balanced nutrient availability through-out the experiments, and was based on levels ofenrichment reported in previous papers (Worm et al.2000), knowledge of sediment resuspension rates inour study area (S. Phipps pers. comm.), and the stoi-chiometric ratio of microphytobenthos (Hillebrand &Sommer 1999).Nitrogen and phosphorus were added in a quick-
release form of solid commercial-grade ammonium-nitrate (17% ammoniacal nitrogen, 17% nitrate nitro-gen, Royster-Clark) and super phosphate (46% P
2O5,
Agribusiness), respectively. Each set of nutrients wassubdivided into 5 equal amounts and packaged into2.5 cm diameter packets made of nylon stocking.These were then carefully buried to a depth of approx-imately 10 cm at the 4 corners and center of each fertil-ized plot; 1 measurement of nutrient porewater con-centrations was taken per plot on Days 0, 2, 4 and 6 ofthe fall experiment at each site. Samples on Days 0 and2 were taken before burying the nutrient packets. Thesamples were taken and processed as detailed in nextsubsection.
Examination of the porewater nutrient concentra-
tions for the fall experiments revealed that, in general,concentrations remained higher in the fertilized plotsat the 2 sites through Day 4, but that differencestended to fade on Day 6 (Fig. 2, Table 1). Therefore, inorder to ensure increased, stoichiometrically-balancednutrient availability in the fertilized plots throughoutthe experiments, we fertilized again on Day 4 in allexperiments performed during the other seasons, butwith only half the amount of nutrients added on Days 0and 2. Thus, the final quantities added per plot in Feb-
ruary 2003, May 2003 and July 2003 were3.15 g N and 0.445 g P per plot at Magnolia,and 4.47 g N and 0.66 g P per plot atReserve, on Days 0 and 2, and 1.58 g N and0.223 g P per plot at Magnolia, and 2.24 g Nand 0.33 g P per plot at Reserve, on Day 4.We also measured porewater nutrient con-centrations on Days 0 (before burying thepackets) and 6 in each of these 3 seasons.One measurement was taken per plot ineach site as described below. While nutri-ent concentrations remained similarbetween fertilized and non-fertilized plotson Day 0, fertilized plots tended to showhigher values on Day 6 (Table 1), indicatingthat our enrichment procedure generallyprovided increased, stoichiometrically bal-anced nutrient availability in the treatmentplots throughout the experimental period.
Porewater nutrients. Porewater nutrient
samples were collected using a porewatersampler consisting of an 8 cm long piece ofrigid aquarium tubing with holes drilled atregular intervals and attached to a 60 mlsyringe. The tubing was inserted into thesediment and the porewater drawn up intothe syringe and taken back to the labora-tory for processing. All samples were fil-tered through 0.45 µm glass-fiber filters32

sured on Days 0 and 3 of the experiment.
Sediment primary production. Sediment primary
production was measured using the 14C uptake me-
thod of Van Raalte et al. (1974) for sediment-associatedalgae, with some modifications (Moncreiff et al. 1992).Incubations were performed in situ . Sediment cores
were taken with a 2.5 cm diameter corer. For eachcore, the top 1 cm of sediment was sliced onto a sili-cone stopper and stopper and sediment were pluggedinto an incubation quartz tube of the same diameter:the sediment was gently pushed 1 cm above the top ofthe collection core, the bottom of the quartz core waspressed firmly over the top rim of the collection core,and the top cm of sediment was transferred onto thesilicone stopper by sliding the quartz tube onto thestopper. This procedure minimized the possible distur-bance associated with slicing and transferring of thetop 1 cm of sediment to the incubation tube. We added3 µCi of NaH
14CO 3to 10 ml of filtered site seawater,
and gently spiked the solution into the tube by trick-ling along the tube wall. We took 3 cores from eachexperimental treatment, each of the 3 cores beingtaken from a different plot (i.e. 3 complete rows of the5 were sampled). In addition, in all of the plots of one ofthe rows selected, a second tube containing the isotopeand dichlorophenyl dimethyl urea (DCMU) at a con-centration of 10
–5M was incubated along with the iso-
tope-only tube. DCMU is a natural herbicide whichinhibits the operation of Photosystem II and active car-bon uptake (Legendre et al. 1983). Thus, the tubes that
received DCMU acted as ‘blanks’ for the determina-tion of photosynthetic uptake of 
14C (i.e. uptake in the
isotope-only tubes minus uptake in the DCMU tubes).The tubes were then sealed with top silicone stoppersand cable ties, stabilized with wire frames to ensureadequate anchorage to the bottom, returned to thesame plots from which they were originally taken, andincubated for 4 to 5 h. When anchoring the tubes, carewas taken to level off the incubated sediment with thesurrounding sediment. At the end of the incubationperiod, 
14C uptake was stopped by the addition of
buffered 4% formalin, and the samples transported tothe laboratory for further processing. The incubationsall occured around solar noon and under sunny condi-tions. When weather permitted, they were carried outon Days 2, 4 and 6.
In the laboratory, the samples were washed from
the incubation tubes with 50 ml of 2% HCl onto0.45 µm cellulose nitrate filters (Whatman); this pro-cess also removed all unincorporated and sediment-bound 
14C. The filter and sediment were placed in
50 ml polypropylene centrifuge tubes for digestion(accomplished with the addition of 10 ml of concen-trated HNO
3 [reagent grade] per tube) and incubated
in a fume hood for 12 h. The digested samples werecentrifuged for 10 min at 1000 rpm, and 1 ml of thesupernatant of each sample was added to 9 ml of0.75 M tris buffer (ICN Biomedicals). Finally, 0.5 ml ofthis combination was added to 4.5 ml of scintillationcocktail (EcoLume) and the number of scintillationscounted over 5 min using a Packard Tri-Carb 2500-TRscintillation counter. Count rates were given in disin-tegrations per minute (dpm), which were then con-verted to values of primary production (PP, in mg Cm

on ice, and returned to the laboratory for processing.Concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon weredetermined using a Shimadzu TOC-5000 fitted with anon-dispersive infrared detector. On each experimen-tal day at each site, duplicate samples were run andthe mean value was used in the above equation. Sincedpm in the DCMU incubations were generally low andsimilar, the 4 DCMU samples measured on each daywere averaged as a single value.
Sediment metabolism. To measure how nutrient
enrichment and decreased light availability affectedsediment metabolism, we recorded changes in dis-solved oxygen concentration inside transparent andopaque chambers placed over the sediment surface.The chambers were made of clear plastic and werecylindrical, measuring 18.4 cm in diameter and 21.6 cmin height. Some of the transparent chambers werepainted with several coats of flat black paint to makethem completely opaque. On each sampling day,1 transparent and 1 opaque chamber were placedwithin each plot and anchored onto the bottom suchthat only the top 15 cm of the chamber was above thesediment surface. Thus, these metabolism measure-ments integrated the sediment and the overlying 15 cm(i.e. height of incubation chamber) of water column,which often contains much resuspended sediment(Shaffer & Sullivan 1988, de Jonge & van Beusekom1992, S. Phipps & M. Sullivan pers. comm.).
Before deploying the chambers, the sediment sur-
face was checked for large animals (i.e. crabs, hermitcrabs, oysters) and pieces of debris, which wereremoved when present. Incubation time was between3 and 5 h. All incubations were around solar noon andalways in sunny conditions. When weather permitted,incubations were carried out on Days 2, 4 and 6. At theend of each incubation period, water samples wereremoved from the chambers with a 60 ml syringe andattached tubing by inserting the tubing through a1.0 cm diameter hole at the top of the chamber (thishad remained capped throughout the incubationperiod). Care was taken to draw water from approxi-mately the middle of the chamber. After collection, thewater was gently transferred to a 50 ml BOD bottle andthe oxygen concentration read with a field oxygenprobe (WTW Oxi 197i/StirrOx G, WTW MeasurementSystems). Prior to beginning the incubations, at least 3measurements of the initial oxygen concentration inthe water column were taken near the incubation area.Sediment net production (NP, in mg C m
–2sediment
h–1) corresponds to the difference between final and
initial oxygen concentrations in the transparent cham-bers, sediment respiration ( R, in mg C m
–2sediment
h–1) to the difference in the dark chambers. They were
calculated by following:NP = [( F– I)/t] ×C ×H ×Pcon
R= [(F– I)/t] ×C ×H ×R
where Fand Iare the dissolved oxygen concentrations
(mg l–1) at the end and start of the incubation, tis the
incubation time (h), Cis the conversion factor of liters
to m3, His the height of the water column in the cham-
ber (0.15 m), Pconis the oxygen/carbon conversion fac-
tor for sediment net production (0.344 mg C mg–1oxy-
gen based on a photosynthetic quotient of 1.2 and arespiratory quotient of 1: Strickland & Parsons 1972),and Ris the oxygen/carbon conversion factor for sedi-
ment respiration (0.375 mg C mg
–1oxygen based on a
respiratory quotient of 1: Strickland & Parsons 1972).Finally, sediment gross primary production was calcu-lated as the difference between net production andrespiration (mg C m
–2sediment h–1).
Hydrographic conditions. On each sampling date,
we also measured photosynthetically active radiation(PAR) at the sediment surface (both as absoluteamount and as percentage of incident light at theair–water interface), water-column temperature, salin-ity and dissolved oxygen concentration. Measure-ments were taken adjacent to the experimental plots(<5 m) around midday. On some days, a second PARreading was made at the end of the benthic chamberincubation period. PAR was measured using a LICORquantum irradiance meter equipped with air andunderwater sensors fitted to 4 πcells (LICOR). Temper-
ature, salinity and dissolved oxygen were measured atthe water surface and right above the sediment using aYSI Model 85 meter (Yellow Springs Instrument). On afew days, we also took PAR measurements beneath anumber of shaded frames.
Water-column nutrient (nitrate, nitrite, ammonium
and orthophosphate) concentrations and phytoplank-ton biomass were also measured on Days 0 and 6 adja-cent to the experimental plots. We took 6 replicatewater samples from approximately mid-depth, andstored them on ice for transport to the laboratory foranalysis. Samples were filtered through a 0.45 µmglass-fiber filter (Pall Life Sciences), the filtrate wascollected in duplicate nalgene bottles, and both filterand filtrate were stored at –80°C until processing.Phytoplankton biomass was measured as chlorophyll a
according to the fluorometric technique of Parsons etal. (1984). Water-column nutrient concentrations weredetermined using a Skalar SAN
+autoanalyzer.
Statistical analyses. We used a 3-way fixed-factor
ANOVA (Sigmastat, Version 2.03, SPSS) to investi-gate the effects of light reduction and nutrient enrich-ment on sediment primary production and metabo-lism. Day (2, 4 or 6) is considered as the third fixedfactor. The reasons are 2-fold. First, even though werepeatedly sampled the same plots, we targeted a dif-34Stutes et al.: Enrichment/shading effects on estuarine sediments
ferent sediment location each time we took a new
sample from a given plot. As a result, most probablycompletely new organisms entered the incubationquartz tubes or benthic chambers each time the plotwas sampled. Therefore, successive samples withinthe same plot were not co-depended due to repeatedinclusion of the same organisms, thus rendering arepeated-measures design with time as the repeated-measure factor, inappropriate (Mead 1992, Quinn &Keough 2002). Second, our intent was to examine theeffects of the 6 d manipulation at 3 times intervalsthat approximately corresponded to 3 successive gen-erations of the benthic microalgae in the sedimentcommunity studied. Thus, measurements were madeevery 2 d after initiation of the experiments, since 2 droughly correspond to the turnover time of benthicmicroalgal populations (Cebrian 1999). Thus, timecan be interpreted as a fixed factor, with the 2 d mea-surement intervals serving as a proxy for successivepopulations (Sokal & Rohlf 1995, Zar 1998). All datawere tested for normality and homogeneity of vari-ance and, where necessary, transformed to meetthese requirements.RESULTS
Hydrographic conditions
Water-column depth was higher in spring and sum-

Our depth measurements var-ied from 0.4 to 1.2 m at Magnolia and from 0.2 to 1.2 mat Reserve. Water temperature and salinity alsoshowed clear seasonal oscillations. At Magnolia, tem-perature ranged from 14.8 in the winter to 31.3°C inlate summer–early fall, and from 10.3 to 30.9°C for thesame seasons at Reserve. Salinity was lower in thespring and summer, coinciding with the rainy season,ranging from ca. 0 to 14.3 at Magnolia, and from 0.1 to11.9 at Reserve.

bottom, both as absolute amount and as percentage ofincident light at the water surface, was higher in falland winter and lower in spring and summer, consistentwith the seasonality observed in water-column depth.In particular, summer PAR values were extremely low,averaging 86 (4% of surface light) and 28 (1% of sur-face light) µmol photons m

Reserve, respectively (Table 2).
Sediment primary production
Sediment primary production varied among sam-
pling days in all the experiments at Magnolia, butonly in the summer experiment at Reserve (Table 3,
Fig. 3). At Magnolia, reduced light availabilitydecreased primary production on all sampling days inthe winter and spring experiments, but only on Day 6in the summer experiment. At Reserve, reduced lightdepressed primary production on all sampling days inthe winter and spring experiment, although the effectwas marginal in the latter. Nutrient enrichment didnot affect primary production, regardless of site andseason, except for a minor increase in the differencesamong sampling days in the summer experiment atMagnolia.
Sediment metabolism
Gross primary production of the sedi-
ment varied among sampling days in thespring and summer experiments at Mag-nolia and in the fall and spring experi-ments at Reserve (Table 4, Fig. 4). At Mag-nolia, decreased light availability reducedgross production on all sampling days inthe fall experiment and on Days 2 and 6 inthe spring experiment. At Reserve, de-creased light depressed gross productionon Day 6 in the fall experiment and on allsampling days in the winter and spring ex-periments, although the effect was notstrong. Nutrient enrichment had no effectin any season or site.
Sediment respiration generally varied
substantially among sampling days, withlarge differences at the 2 sites for all exper-iments, except for the spring experiment atMagnolia (Table 5, Fig. 5). Reduced lightavailability increased respiration on allsampling days in the fall experiments atMagnolia and Reserve, and only margin-ally in the spring experiment at Reserve.Nutrient enrichment had no effect on res-piration regardless of site or season.36

Sediment net production also generally
varied among sampling days, particularlyat Reserve, and fluctuated between posi-tive and negative values, depending onthe interplay between gross primary pro-duction and respiration (Table 6, Fig. 6). AtMagnolia, net production decreased withdecreasing light availability on all sam-pling days in the fall experiment, and onDays 2 and 6 in the spring experiment. AtReserve, reduced light decreased net pro-duction on Day 6 in the fall experimentand on all sampling days in the springexperiment. In addition, as found for grossproduction and respiration, nutrient en-richment had no effect on net productionin any site or season, except for a tendencyfor greater reduction in net production inthe non-fertilized than in the fertilizedshaded plots on Day 6 of the fall experi-ment at Reserve.
DISCUSSION
This study has shown a significant nega-
tive effect of shading on sediment primaryproduction in the 2 estuarine sites exam-ined. Measured as oxygen production,reduced light availability decreased pri-mary production at the 2 sites in the fall,winter and spring experiments, although in2 of the experiments the decrease onlyoccurred on 1 or 2 sampling days (i.e. significant inter-action between day and light treatments). Measured as
14C uptake, reduced light availability decreased pri-
mary production on Day 6 of the summer experimentat Magnolia and on all sampling days in the winter andspring experiments at the 2 sites, although thedecrease tended to be less important at Reserve (i.e.0.01 ≤p ≤0.10).Reduced light availability also affected sediment me-
tabolism. Shading increased sediment respiration on alldays in the 2 fall experiments and in the spring experi-ment at Reserve, albeit only marginally in spring. Theincrease in sediment respiration with shading could bepartially due to higher mortality of and/or exudation bybenthic microalgae under conditions of low light avail-ability and subsequent use of microalgal particulate37

and dissolved detritus by decomposers (De Jonge &
Colijn 1994, Barranguet et al. 1997). In addition, withthe exception of the experiment in winter at Reserve,sediment net production decreased with decreasinglight availability, at least on 1 of the sampling days, inall the fall and spring experiments. All the decreasesobserved in net production with decreased light avail-ability coincided with concomitant decreases in grossprimary production and, for the fall experiment at Mag-nolia and the fall and spring experiments at Reserve,also with concomitant increases in respiration, althoughthose increases were sometimes only marginal (0.05 < p≤ 0.1). Thus, the decreases in sediment net production
observed with reduced light availability in our studyappear to be a consequence of depressed photosyn-thetic rates of benthic microalgae (i.e. lower rates ofsediment gross primary production) and, generally,simultaneous increases in sediment respiration rates.
The apparent light-limitation of sediment primary
production caused by our shading treatment duringthe experiments in the fall, winter and spring is furthersupported by a comparison of our measurements ofnatural light intensity at the sediment surface withpublished photosynthesis–irradiance curves for ben-
thic (microalgal) communities. The meanvalues of natural light intensity recorded atthe sediment surface during the fall, winterand spring experiments ranged from 208 to538 µmol photons m
–2s–1at Magnolia and
from 127 to 590 µmol photons m–2s–1at
Reserve. Thus, since the shading treatmentreduced light availability by 50%, the meanvalues of light intensity at the sediment sur-face under the shaded frames should haveranged from approximately 104 to 269 µmolphotons m
–2s–1at Magnolia and from 63 to
295 µmol photons m–2s–1at Reserve during
the experiments in the fall, winter andspring, which is consistent with the numberof direct light measurements we took at thesediment surface under the shaded frames.Published values of the minimum lightintensity at which microphytobenthic pho-tosynthesis saturates usually range from300 to 500 µmol photons m
–2s–1(Pinckney &
Zingmark 1991, 1993, Blanchard & Mon-tana 1992, Blanchard & Gall 1994, Wolfstein& Hartig 1998). This suggests that, duringthe fall, winter and spring experiments, ourshading treatment frequently reduced lightavailability below saturating levels formicrophytobenthic photosynthesis and thussignificantly depressed sediment primaryproduction.38

In contrast, shading did not have an important effect
on sediment primary production in the summer experi-ments. (We did not find any effects of shading on pri-mary production when measured as oxygen productionin either of the 2 summer experiments and, when mea-sured as 
14C uptake, we only found a negative effect on
Day 6 at Magnolia). The low natural levels of lightintensity measured at the sediment surface during thesummer experiments may help explain why we foundalmost no negative effect of shading inthat season. During the summer experi-ments, natural light intensity at thesediment surface ranged from 28 to158 µmol photons m
–2s–1(average
86 µmol) at Magnolia and from 6 to59 µmol photons m
–2s–1(average 28) at
Reserve. These low light levels wouldallow little microphytobenthic produc-tion even without experimental shadingduring the summer compared with theexperiments in the other seasons(as supported by our measurements).More importantly, and based on photo-synthesis–irradiance curves publishedfor other microphytobenthic communi-ties (Hargrave et al. 1983, Pinckney &Zingmark 1991, 1993, Blanchard & Mon-tagna 1992, Blanchard & Gall 1994,Wolfstein & Hartig 1998, Dodds et al.1999, Blackford 2002), the additional50% reduction in light availabilityimposed by our shading treatment (onaverage from 86 to 43 µmol photons m
–2
s–1at Magnolia and from 28 to 14 µmol
photons m–2s–1at Reserve) would only
cause a small additional reduction in therate of absolute microphytobenthic pho-tosynthesis relative to the reduction ob-served for the experiments in the otherseasons. Such a small decrease in ab-solute microphytobenthic productioncould have easily remained undetectedin our experiment, since it would probably have been
overridden by physical and biological differencesamong the experimental plots such as sediment and or-ganism patchiness, benthic microalgal species compo-sition, detrital input from the adjacent marsh and sedi-ment resuspension.
Thus, the response of sediment primary production to
shading at our study sites is dependent on the naturallevels of light intensity at the sediment surface. When39

natural light availability for microphytobenthos re-
mained >100 µmol photons m–2s–1(normally the case
during the fall, winter and spring experiments), a 50%decrease in light availability generally caused a signifi-cant reduction in sediment primary production. In con-trast, when natural availability remained <100 µmolphotons m
–2s–1(the normal situation during the sum-
mer experiments), a further 50% reduction in lightavailability did not normally lead to a significant de-crease in primary production. To further demonstratethis trend, we calculated the ratio of mean productionin non-shaded plots to that in shaded plots for each dayon which the incubations were done, and plotted theratios versus the natural light intensity measured at thesediment surface on that day (Fig. 7). Fig. 7 shows thatratios relatively close to 1 (i.e. similar production undernon-shaded and shaded conditions) generally occurredat intensities <100 µmol m
–2s–1, and accordingly mostly
during the summer experiments, whereas the ratiotended to increase (i.e. higher values under non-shaded conditions) with higher intensities. It is inter-
esting that the ratios seemed to decrease and becomecloser to 1 at the highest values of light intensityrecorded (>600 µmol photons m
–2s–1), especially when
primary production was measured as oxygen pro-duction, suggesting some photoinhibition of micro-phytobenthic photosynthesis and/or little effect ofshading, since the sediment under the shaded frameswould still receive near-saturating intensities. The re-sponse of sediment primary production to natural lightavailability is shown by the shading experiments inFig. 7B; this could, if other important factors such asnutrients and temperature do not limit productionseverely, be a general feature of estuarine systems sub-ject to ample fluctuations in bottom light availability.
In sharp contrast with the important impact of shad-
ing, nutrient enrichment had little effect on sedimentprimary production and metabolism at the estuarinesites studied. We found that nutrient enrichment onlyslightly increased the negative effects of reduced lighton sediment net production on Day 6 of the fall exper-iment at Reserve (i.e. greater reduction in net produc-tion in the non-fertilized than in the fertilized shadedplots), and  sediment primary production measured as
14C uptake among sampling days in the summer
experiment at Magnolia. It is interesting that, despitethe fact that we applied nutrients in a stoichio-metrically balanced ratio and compensated somewhatfor the apparent natural phosphorus imbalance formicrophytobenthic growth, we observed little impactof our nutrient addition on sediment primary produc-tion and metabolism. The minor role of sediment nutri-ent enrichment in our experiments probably stems, atleast in part, from 2 characteristics of the study sites.First, natural light availability at the sediment surface,even in the fall and winter, often appears to be limitingfor microphytobenthic photosynthesis, and this couldmask any positive impact of nutrient addition (Bar-ranguet et al. 1998, Meyercordt & Meyer-Reil 1999).Second, the sites feature high ambient nutrient con-centrations in the sediment porewater, which wouldmean that addition of supplementary nutrients wouldhave little impact. At Magnolia, nitrogen (NH
4 + NO 3 +
NO 2) ranged from 2.4 to 125.1 µmol l–1(median =
42.1 µmol l–1) and phosphorus from 0.1 to 18.6 µmol l–1
(median = 0.8 µmol l–1) in the sediment porewater of
the non-fertilized plots in our experiments (valuesobtained by pooling together measurements on Day 0,see ‘Materials and methods’). At Reserve, nitrogenranged from 6.8 to 842.4 µmol l
–1(median = 111 µmol
l–1) and phosphorus from 0.11 to 120.1 µmol l–1(median
= 4.7 µmol l–1). Indeed, perhaps with the exception of
phosphorus concentrations at Magnolia, these valuesappear to be saturating for microphytobenthic growthunder adequate light and temperature, based on40

The quantities of nitrogen and phosphorus applied
per fertilized plot in all experiments were calculatedfrom the mean ambient concentrations measured priorto starting the fall experiment. This, however, does notaffect the conclusion that nutrient addition is of littleconsequence for sediment primary production andmetabolism at our study sites. First, our enrichmentalways represented a substantial increase relative toambient concentrations (i.e. measurements on Day 0prior to adding nutrients at the specific site and sea-son). Second, we generally found an ambient relativedeficiency in phosphorus in the sediment porewater(i.e. mean nitrogen:phosphorus molar ratio con-siderably higher than 17 for concentrations mea-sured on Day 0), but nutrients were always added tothe fertilized plots at an approximately 15 to 16 nitro-gen:phosphorus molar ratio. Therefore, had relativephosphorus availability been limiting for microphyto-benthic production, we should have found a significantimpact on sediment primary production and meta-bolism in the fertilized plots at least under adequatelight and temperature levels.
The methods used to measure sediment primary pro-
duction and metabolism have inherent limitations, butthese limitations should not affect our conclusions sig-nificantly. Specifically, the water enclosed in the ben-thic chambers was not stirred during the incubations.This could have led to reduced oxygen exchangebetween the sediment and the overlying 15 cm watercolumn in the chamber and, thus, to underestimates ofsediment primary production and respiration. In addi-tion, we did not spike 
14C directly into the pore spaces
of the top 1 cm of sediment incubated in the quartztubes, which could also have resulted in underesti-mates of sediment primary production. However, theselimitations were common to all our experimental treat-ments, and thus the differences observed between ourexperimental treatments should be indicative of thetrue impact of light reduction and nutrient addition onthe variables measured. Thus, in the experimentswhere both types of measurements were made, theresults obtained with primary production measured asoxygen production matched closely those obtained as
14C uptake.
The results of this study have important implications
for the management of Weeks Bay and other eutrophic,turbid estuaries: We have shown that a short-term(<1 wk), small-scale (1 m
2bottom area) 50% reduction
in incident light generally depresses sediment primaryproduction at the 2 study locations examined, exceptduring the summer experiments. The 2 locations exam-ined are at opposite ends of Weeks Bay and differ insediment type (sand at Magnolia, unconsolidated mud
at Reserve) and ambient sediment primary production(usually higher at Magnolia), but a substantial depres-sion of production due to a 50% reduction in light avail-ability was a consistent feature of both sites. Therefore,because water-column characteristics (i.e. high nutrientand chlorophyll aconcentrations, substantial turbidity
and light extinction, and seasonal salinity, temperatureand oxygen concentrations) at our 2 sites are similar tothose at many other locations in Weeks Bay (Pennock etal. 2001), the negative effect of short-term, small-scaleshading on sediment primary production could be ageneral feature of this system. This suggests that thedeployment of permanent or temporary man-madestructures in Weeks Bay, such as docks, fishing piers ormooring platforms, would adversely affect sedimentprimary production in the bay. Other anthropogeni-cally-induced activities that can significantly reducethe amount of light reaching the sediment, such asdredging (e.g. de Jonge 1983, de Jonge & de Jonge2002) and the promotion of phytoplankton bloomsthrough increased nutrient loading, could also have adetrimental effect on sediment primary productionthrough light limitation of microphytobenthic photo-synthesis. In turn, depressed microphytobenthic pro-ductivity could have a negative impact on the many im-portant functions of these communities in estuarinesystems, such as sediment stabilization, chemical re-cycling and food provision (e.g. de Jonge & vanBeusekom 1992, 1995). In contrast, sediment nutrientenrichment does not seem to have any major conse-quences for sediment primary production in this al-ready eutrophic estuarine system. These results and thesuggested consequences for management could also beapplicable to other eutrophic, turbid estuaries.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that, in
accordance with our initial hypothesis, the impact oflight reduction on sediment primary production in aturbid, nutrient-rich estuary is more important than theimpact of additional nutrient enrichment. In view of theimportance of microphytobenthic communities forcoastal systems and the pervasive, worldwide eutro-phication of these systems, similar experiments in oligo-trophic, high-light locations are required. The results ofsuch experiments would probably differ from ours, sincea greater role of nutrient enrichment would be expectedfor pristine locations. Elucidating how communities ofbenthic microalgae respond to increased eutrophicationacross a gradient of initial trophic conditions is importantfor environmental management of this problem.
