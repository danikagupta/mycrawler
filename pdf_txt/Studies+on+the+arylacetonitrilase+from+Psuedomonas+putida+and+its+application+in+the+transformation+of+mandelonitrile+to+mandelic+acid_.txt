TECHNOLOGIES DEVELOPED  
I was heading the National Facility of Biochemical Engineering Research and ProcessDevelopment 
Centre at Institute of Microbial Technology, Chandigarh . Four technologies were developed and transferred 
to the industries,  
1. Development of an innovative environment friendly process technology for production of natural 
streptokinase, a life -saving thrombolytic drug, and its successful commercialization . This process was 
given to M/S Cadila Healthcare, Ahemdabad.  
2. Developing a high osmotolerant, e thanol tolerant and genetically modified strain of Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae for the production of alcohol from molasses.  This process was licensed to various distilleries 
in India through VittalMalya Research foundation, Bangalore.  
3. Development of a Biotran sformation process for conversion of rifamycin B to rifamycin S.  This 
process of enzymatic transformation of rifamycin B to rifamycin S was demonstrated and subsequently 
transferred to M/S Indian Drugs and Pharmaceutical Limited, Rishikesh and to M/S Lupin  chemical Ltd. on 
non-exclusive basis.  U. C. Banerjee, Ph.D.  
 28 In the National Facility of Biochemical Engineering Research and ProcessDevelopment Center,  the 
following services were given to the different parties on payment basis.  
1. A process was optimized for the concentration of  6-APA from its other liquor in a RO (reverse osmosis) 
system.  The 6 -APA concentration (4000 ppm) recovered from the mother liquor was about 90% 
employing RO system.  This work was carried out for Fermenta Pharma, Kulu.  
2. A filtration process was optimized in a pilot scale filter press (Plate and Frame Filter Press and Horizontal 
Filter Press) for the filtration of an inorganic catalyst developed by Thapar Corporate Research and 
Development Center (Patiala ).  Different process parameters such as filter quali ty (pore size), pressure 
drop, flow rate etc. were optimized with respect to quantity of material obtained.  
3. A process was scaled up in 150 L fermenter for the production of an industrial enzyme.  Different 
parameters were optimized during the growth and pr oduction of extracellular enzyme.  This work was 
carried out for the  SPIC Science Foundation, Madras . 
4. A process was scaled up for the production of Hepatitis B -surface antigen (HBsAg) in 150 L fermenter.  
This work was carried out for the International Cen ter for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, 
New Delhi . 
5. Laboratory scale fermenter was used for the optimization of process parameters for the production of 
Butanediol using Enterobactoer cloacae .  This work carried out for the Microbiology Department, 
Panjab University, Chandigarh . 
6. A complete process was optimized for the production of Hepatitis -B surface antigen (HBsAg) in laboratory 
fermenters.  This work was carried for Transgene Vaccines Ltd., Hyderabad in collaboration with 
Rhein Biotech, Germany.  
7. A process was optimized for the production of xylanase  using Termitomycesclypeatus in a 20 liter 
laboratory fermenter.  Different fermenter runs were taken with varied agitation and aeration rates and 55 -
56 IU/mL xylanase activity was obtained in 60 -72 h fe rmentation. This work was done for Indian Institute 
of Chemical Biology,  Calcutta.  
8. A bio -process was optimized for the production of ethanol using agro -residues as carbon source.  
Delignified agro -residues were saccharified using cellulase from T. reesei  and then fermented to alcohol 
using S. cerevesiae .  This work was done for the Biochemistry Department  of Punjab Agriculture 
University, Ludhiana . 
9. Demonstrations were given to Gujarat Themis Biosyn Ltd.  (GTBL) for the biotransformation of 
rifamycin B to rif amycin S in aerobic reactor with rifamycin B fermentation broth.  
10. A downstream process was optimized in Rotary Vacuum Filter  (RVF) using cephalosporin fermentation
