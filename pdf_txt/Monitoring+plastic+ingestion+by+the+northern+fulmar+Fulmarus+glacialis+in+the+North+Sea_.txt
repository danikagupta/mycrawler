OSPAR EcoQOMSFD-GESabstract
The abundance of plastics in stomachs of northern fulmars from the North Sea is used in the OSPAR
Ecological Quality Objective (EcoQO) for marine litter. The preliminary EcoQO de ﬁnes acceptable
ecological quality as the situation where no more than 10% of fulmars exceed a critical level of 0.1 g of
plastic in the stomach. During 2003 e2007, 95% of 1295 fulmars sampled in the North Sea had plastic in
the stomach (on average 35 pieces weighing 0.31 g) and the critical level of 0.1 g of plastic was exceeded
by 58% of birds, with regional variations ranging from 48 to 78%. Long term data for the Netherlandssince the 1980s show a decrease of industrial, but an increase of user plastics, with shipping and ﬁsheries
as the main sources. The EcoQO is now also used as an indicator for Good Environmental Status in theEuropean Marine Strategy Framework Directive.

1. Introduction
Marine debris can have serious economic and ecological
consequences. Even on a local scale, such as the Shetland Islands in
Scotland, the economic damage can exceed a million Euro ’s annu-
ally ( Hall, 2000; Lozano and Mouat, 2009; Mouat et al., 2010 ). The
ecological damage from marine litter is sometimes dramatically
illustrated by entangled wildlife. Less apparent are the conse-
quences of the ingestion of plastics and other types of litter,common among a wide range of marine organisms ( Laist, 1987,
1997; Derraik, 2002). Plastics gradually break down to micro-scopic sizes and there is a growing concern that ‘micro-plastics ’
may enter the base of marine food webs via sediment- or ﬁlter-
feeding organisms ( Thompson et al., 2004, 2009; Browne et al.,
2008; Graham and Thompson, 2009 ). These concerns are exacer-
bated by evidence that plastics, in addition to having many
embedded chemicals, also adsorb toxic pollutants from the
surrounding water, thus potentially boosting bioaccumulation of
dangerous contaminants in the food web by ingestion (Endo et al.,
2005; Hale et al., 2010; Teuten et al., 2007; Moore, 2008; Arthur
et al., 2009; Teuten et al., 2009 ). The potential toxic danger of
plastic ingestion thus affects the higher food web levels not only *Corresponding author.

nated prey.
Several early international policy measures attempted to reduce
input of litter into the marine environment, such as the 1972 Lon-
don Dumping Convention, the MARPOL Convention 73/78, and the
1992 Oslo and Paris Conventions for the protection of the marine
environment of the northeast Atlantic (OSPAR). In the absence of
signiﬁcant improvement, new policy initiatives were developed by,
for example, the EC Directive 2000/59/EC on Port Reception Facil-ities ( EC, 2000 ), the Bergen Declaration of the North Sea Ministerial
Conference (2002) and most recently by the inclusion of litter in the
European Marine Strategy Framework Directive ( EC, 2008, 2010 ).
Emphasizing the need for policy aims to be quanti ﬁable, the North
Sea Ministers decided to establish a system of Ecological Quality
Objectives for the North Sea (EcoQO’ s) to be implemented by
OSPAR and ICES (International Council for the Exploration of theSea). For marine litter, ICES had proposed an EcoQO based on the
abundance of plastics in stomachs of seabirds (e.g., ICES-WGSE,
2001 ). Studies from the North Atlantic and North Paci ﬁc had
shown that the northern fulmar ( Fulmarus glacialis ) commonly
ingests litter and accumulates plastic in the stomach (Bourne, 1976;
Baltz and Morejohn, 1976; Day et al., 1985; Furness, 1985; van
Franeker, 1985; Moser and Lee, 1992; Robards et al., 1995; Blight
and Burger, 1997 ). Synthetic debris may sometimes be ingested
because it somehow resembles prey ( Derraik, 2002 ), but in many
instances it is unclear what triggers the ingestion of plastic objects.
Unlike many other seabird species, for example gulls, fulmars feed
only at sea, never on land and normally do not regurgitate hard
prey remains. Indigestible food parts accumulate in the muscular
part of the stomach to be slowly ground down to a size that may
pass into the gut. Consequently, the abundance of hard prey
remains in the stomach, including plastics, provides an integrated
picture of ingestion over a period of time before death. Different
quantities of plastic in stomachs of fulmars from the North Sea and
from the Arctic ( van Franeker, 1985), and differences among related
species in the Antarctic ( van Franeker and Bell, 1988; Ainley et al.,
1990 ) provided early evidence for this basic assumption. In
combination with the fulmar ’s high abundance and wide distri-
bution ( Del Hoyo et al., 1992; Hatch and Nettleship, 1998 ) these
features make the species an optimal candidate for the ecologicalmonitoring of litter in the marine environment.
Since the initial identi ﬁcation of the ‘Seabird-Plastic-EcoQO ’by
ICES and the North Sea Ministers, close co-operation has grown
between researchers around the North Sea. The work started with
a pilot study in the Netherlands, investigating the usage of beached
fulmars as an indicator of the effectiveness of Dutch shipping and
harbor policies to minimize waste disposal at sea ( van Franeker and
Meijboom, 2002 ). The pilot project assessed potential sources of
bias in ﬂuencing stomach contents, adequate sample size and the
most appropriate metric to use. Internationally, monitoring ofplastics in fulmars started as a part of the ‘Save the North Sea ’
campaign ( Save the North Sea, 2004; van Franeker et al., 2005 ). In
a number of research reports (most recent: van Franeker and the
SNS Fulmar Study Group, 2008) and policy documents (most
recent: OSPAR,
 2008 ) the metrics, data presentation and target
deﬁnition of the Fulmar-Plastic-EcoQO have gradually been evalu-
ated and matured to a level ready for formal implementation.
Although formally still a ‘proposed ’EcoQO, OSPAR (2010a,b) pres-
ents it as being implemented. The EcoQO is based on the mass ofplastics in fulmar stomachs, with the preliminary target for
acceptable ecological conditions de ﬁned as:
“There should be less than 10% of northern fulmars having 0.1 g or
more plastic in the stomach in samples of 50 e100 beached fulmars
from each of 5 different regions of the North Sea over a period of atleast 5 years ”.The OSPAR target level is an arbitrary political choice, matching
pollution levels in environments where anthropogenic in ﬂuence is
expected to be low. Data are lacking to identify a target that
represents a no-effect level for fulmars or any other ecosystem
component.
The purpose of this article is to disseminate the concept of the
Fulmar-Plastic-EcoQO as a tool to quantify trends and geographic
patterns in marine litter, which will provide a sound basis for policy
decisions in combination with increased public awareness. Similar
tools are required for implementation of the ‘Good Environmental
Status (GES) ’requirement in the Marine Strategy Framework
Directive (MSFD) ( EC, 2008 ).
2. Materials and methods
In the Netherlands, volunteers of the Dutch Seabird Group (Nederlandse Zee-
vogelgroep NZG) involved in Beached Bird Surveys have collected dead fulmars for
this study since the early 1980s. Other organizations such as coastal bird rehabili-tation centers also assist in collecting. Similar sampling began in all countriesbordering the North Sea following the start of the Save the North Sea project in 2002,with participating groups in Shetland, Orkney, eastern England, the French Channel,Belgium, Germany, Denmark, Norway and Sweden. These groups ranged fromvolunteer birders to governmental research institutes and municipal beach cleaning
projects. The Faroe Islands have participated in the project as a reference area
outside the North Sea. Sampling locations were grouped into the following NorthSea regions: Scottish Islands, eastern England, Channel area, southeast North Sea(Belgium, Netherlands, Germany) and Skagerrak area (Denmark, Sweden, Norway).
Fulmar corpses were stored frozen until processed in batches in the laboratory.
Standard dissection methods structured the recording of a broad range of data neededto assess sex, age, breeding status, body condition, probable cause of death, origin, andother potentially relevant issues. Thorough attention was given to age-related char-
acters because age was the only variable previously found to in ﬂuence the quantity of
litter in stomachs ( van Franeker and Meijboom, 2002 ). Assessments used develop-
mental stages of sexual organs (size, shape, color) and the presence and size of the
Bursa of Fabricius (a gland-like organ near the end of the gut involved in immunitysystems of young birds, but disappearing within the ﬁrst year of life or shortly after).
Supporting information on age was derived from plumage details and timing of moult.Complete information on dissection methods and forms used is provided in theproject dissection manual ( van Franeker, 2004 ; plus addenda in Online supplement ).
After removal of the stomach, contents were carefully rinsed in a sieve with
a 1 mm mesh and then transferred to a petri dish for sorting under a binocularmicroscope. The 1 mm mesh was used because smaller meshes become cloggedwith mucus from the stomach wall and with food-remains. Analyses using smallermeshes were found to be extremely time consuming and particles smaller than1 mm seemed rare in the stomachs, contributing little to plastic mass. Plastic itemswere categorized into industrial- or user plastics. Industrial plastics are the rawgranular stock from which all sorts of user objects can be made by melting the
granules and adding different substances to give the plastic its desired character-
istics. User plastics are the debris of all sorts of consumer products. User plastics andnon-plastic rubbish are described in further subcategories (see Online supplement )
that are not a part of the formal EcoQO but do play a role in assessments of sources oflitter. After sorting, the plastic and rubbish were left to become completely air-dry inopen petri-dishes for a number of days. Then, for each individual stomach, theprecise number of items and their combined mass was recorded for each subcate-
gory of plastic and litter. Weights were recorded using electronic Sartorius weighing
scales to an accuracy of 0.0001 g. Further details of procedures are provided in theOnline supplement . Data from dissections and stomach content analysis were
initially recorded in Excel spreadsheets and then stored in Oracle relational data-base. The stomach data allow analyses for subcategories of litter or higher groupingsby i) the percentage of birds having the litter in the stomach (incidence or frequencyof occurrence) or ii) number of items or iii) mass. As proposed in the Dutch pilotstudy ( van Franeker and Meijboom, 2002 ) and the international EcoQO ( OSPAR,
2008 ), the main interpretation of data and statistical analyses were based on mass
of plastic. The following conventions and deﬁ nitions apply:
The ’current situation ’is de ﬁned as the most recent 5-year period,
2003e2007 for the purposes of this article, in which data are calculated from
all individuals within that period (i.e., not from annual averages)
EcoQO compliance or performance is de ﬁned as the percentage of birds in
a sample that had 0.1 g or more plastic mass in the stomach
Statistical tests for signi ﬁcance of temporal trends are conducted by linear
regressions ﬁtting ln-transformed plastic mass values for individual birds on
the year of collection
’Recent trend’ is deﬁned as the trend over the past 10 years
’Long term trend ’refers to the full dataset (for the Netherlands from the ﬁrst
individual in 1979)J.A. van Franeker et al. / Environmental Pollution 159 (2011) 2609 e2615 2610For evaluation of regional differences, data from individual birds over the most
recent 5- year period were ﬁtted in a negative binomial generalized linear model
and tested by likelihood ratio test ( Venables and Ripley, 2002 ).
Annual averages are of limited use because small sample sizes, short-term
variations and individual outliers can have a strong effect on results. Thus, as in
the EcoQO target de ﬁnition, 5-year periods are used as the basic unit for data
presentation in tables and ﬁgures. Time related changes are illustrated by running
5-year averages, each time shifting one year and thus overlapping for four years.Where needed, short-term inter-annual comparisons are based on geometricmeans, derived from logarithmically transformed data. See the Online supplement
for details illustrating the skewed distribution of mass data and the relation toarithmetic averages, geometric means and the critical level of 0.1 g used in the
EcoQO.
3. Results
3.1. Long term litter trends based on Dutch data
The incidence of plastic in stomachs of fulmars from the
Netherlands averaged 91% in the 1980s, increased to about 98%
around the year 2000 and has since stabilized at a level slightly
below 95% ( Table 1 ). The average number of plastic particles per
bird was c. 15 in the 1980s, increased to over 30 around the turn ofthe century and currently averages 26. Greater differences exist in
average mass of plastic: initially, as with the number of items, mass
of plastic doubled from 0.34 g in the 1980s to 0.64 g in the late
1990s. However, whereas the number of particles decreased only
slightly in subsequent years, the mass of plastic in the stomachs
halved to a now fairly stable level of 0.28 g of plastic per beached
fulmar, slightly below the 1980s level. A similar but more damp-
ened time trend may be seen in geometric mean masses for 5-year
periods, and in gradual changes in the EcoQO percentage of birds
exceeding the critical limit of 0.1 g of plastic in the stomach.
Remarkably, the EcoQO percentage did not reveal an obvious
change from the 1980s to the late 1990s despite the marked
changes in numbers of particles and mass. This is probably related
to the size and mass differences between industrial and user
plastics and their changing proportions (see below). However, after
the mid-1990s the percentage of birds exceeding the critical level of
0.1 g did show a 10% decrease although this has not continued in
the most recent periods. (Table 1 ,Fig. 1 and Online supplement
Table 2 for statistical details).
For the overall mass of plastics (industrial plus user) in the
stomachs of Dutch fulmars, the regressions for long term trendsshow no signi ﬁcant change as linear tests do not take the initial
increase and subsequent decrease into account. Restricted to theperiod after the mid-1990s, the short-term (10-year) trends for
mass of plastic were initially signi ﬁcantly downwards (e.g.,
p<0.001 for 1996 e2005), but have stabilized and are no longer
signiﬁcant in the most recent test for 1998 e2007. Trends in
abundance for the two major types of plastic were very different(Fig. 2 ). Measured over the full time frame of 1979 e2007, industrial
plastic has decreased signi ﬁcantly. User plastics have increased but
not with consistent signi ﬁcance in all age groups of birds ( Online
supplement Table 2 ). The main change occurred from the 1980s
to 1990s: when industrial plastic mass in stomachs decreased byhalf (decrease1979 e2000 p<0.001) but user plastics tripled
(increase 1979 e2000 p<0.001). Both categories showed decreases
after the mid-1990s that were signi ﬁcant initially (1996 e2005
decreases p¼0.007 for industrial and p<0.001 for user plastic) but
currently show no further change (both not signi ﬁcant for
1998e2007).
3.2. Current litter levels in the wider North Sea
Analyses of time related trends for North Sea areas other than
theNet
herlands are not yet available as data collection in most of
those areas began in 2002 and 2003 and the minimum period fortrend analysis is taken as 10 years. Data presented here are for the
‘current ’5-year period in our analysis, i.e., 2003 e2007. The fulmar
stomachs reveal clear spatial patterns of litter pollution in theNorth Sea ( Table 2 and Fig. 3 and Online supplement). The Likeli-
hood ratio test of the negative binomial model for the ﬁve regions
indicated signi ﬁcant differences (LR stat 11.1832; df ¼4;p¼0.025).
The abundance of plastics was highest in fulmars from the Channelarea, and gradually decreased northwards along both the eastern
and western coasts of the North Sea. The Channel area differed
signiﬁcantly from the neighboring regions of East England (LR Stat
4.7074; df ¼1;p¼0.030) and the SE North Sea (LR Stat 5.0886;
df¼1;p¼0.024). The decreases from East England to the Scottish
Islands and from the SE North Sea to the Skagerrak were notsigniﬁcant.
4. Discussion
Initial evaluation of the time series of Dutch fulmars
(van Franeker and Meijboom, 2002 ) found that only the age
composition of samples of beached birds might cause bias in
analyses for trends over time, with younger birds having more
plastic in the stomach than older birds. Data added after the pilot
study showed that the age difference is consistent to a level that all
different age groups can be combined into a single monitoring unit.
The annual geometric mean mass of plastics shows the same long-
term pattern, and the same short-term annual ﬂuctuations for
adults and non-adults, in spite of the substantial differencebetween these groups ( Fig. 4 ). Thus, as long as age composition of
samples is considered, any risks of age-related bias can becontrolled for and policy reports may use simple “all age ”derived
graphs such as in Fig. 1 . The details of, and reasons for the higher
loads of plastics in younger birds are unclear. Preliminary data from

that breeding adults may lose part of their plastics burden by
feeding it to chicks, but the effects are short-term and insuf ﬁcient
to fully explain the differences between age groups.
Insights into the temporal aspects of fulmar monitoring data can
be derived from Fig. 4 . An aberrant peak in plastic abundance
occurred in 2002 but the consistency of the pattern between age
groups indicates a real event rather than an accidental outlier. Such
consistency often persists even for smaller sample sizes, which
might suggest that the power analyses in van Franeker and
Meijboom (2002) and the OSPAR (2008) recommendations for an
annual sample size of c. 40 birds per location, the use of 5-year
averages and a minimum of 10 years for statistical tests for trends
over time may be overly cautious. However, we emphasize thatcaution must be maintained in information that is used for long-
term policy decisions, especially when short-term events such as
that in 2002 are not properly explained: possibly ﬂooding in central
Europe caused increased riverine input of litter into the North Seain 2002, but we found no way to substantiate this quantitatively.
Thus, although we believe that annual geometric means will
generally re ﬂect true developments, management decisions should
only rely on longer-term data evaluations. For the long term, thereare no comparative datasets in the North Sea area. However, for the
period after 2002, results from beach surveys around the North Sea
conﬁrm the ﬁnding from the Fulmar monitoring in showing that
there is no change in the amount of beached debris ( OSPAR, 2010a ).
Questions concerning the spatial resolution of fulmar plastic
monitoring are gradually being clari ﬁed. Starting with the Save the
North Sea project in 2002, monitoring was expanded to a wide
range of locations around the North Sea. In theory, the ﬂying abil-
ities of fulmars allow them to travel over much or all of the NorthSea in a single or in a very few days. This led to the expectation that
local differences of pollution within the North Sea area were
unlikely to be clearly re ﬂected in fulmar stomach contents.
However, even though we only have 5 e6 years of data, and less for
some locations, data combined into regions reveal a clear pattern inmass of plastics in the fulmar stomachs in the North Sea. Highest
levels occur in the English eFrench Channel area, and these
decrease northwards, reaching a minimum for the North Seaaround the Scottish Islands ( Fig. 3 and Table 2 ). Such a pattern
shows that the bulk of debris in the North Sea must be of relativelylocal origin, and cannot be attributed to a ‘background noise ’of
litter drifting in from distant sources such as the western Atlantic.Warm Gulf Stream water ﬂows into the North Sea around both the
north and south of the UK, and elevated levels of litter in theChannel and southern North Sea compared to the Scottish Islands
provide evidence for litter sources that are predominantly local.
The geographic pattern and variations in subcategories of litter
indicated that shipping and ﬁsheries play a major role in the
pollution of the North Sea with plastic ( van Franeker et al., 2005 ),
a conclusion con ﬁrmed by a large inventory of litter on the beaches

of beached fulmars having more than 0.1 g of plastic in the stomach (running average
over 5-year periods, each bar shifting one year; number of birds in brackets below eachbar). Note that the Y-axis only shows the 50 e70% range whereas the OSPAR target for
the EcoQO is that less than 10% of birds should have more than 0.1 g of plastic in thestomach.J.A. van Franeker et al. / Environmental Pollution 159 (2011) 2609 e2615 2612of Texel in the Netherlands in 2005 (van Franeker, 2005 ). These
ﬁndings for the North Sea con ﬂict with an opinion that globally
most marine debris has a land-based origin ( MEPC, 2009 ).
The spatial differentiation of stomach contents over relatively
small scales implies that, despite potentially high mobility, the
average fulmar in the average situation spends ‘prolonged ’periods
of time within a restricted sea area, enough time to accumulatea (on average) characteristic level of litter in the stomach. Of course
if storm-driven winter movements or synchronous returns to
colonies are followed by sudden mortality, stomach contents may
incidentally not reﬂ ect local conditions. Such incidents may distort
the occasional annual value, but not the average multi-year picture.
Concerning the aspect of stomach contents not always re ﬂecting
the ‘local ’situation, it is relevant to know how long it takes a fulmar
to accumulate an amount of plastic characteristic for the foraging
area. We have no way to determine this directly, but can make
a rough assessment of time scales from the rate of disappearance of
plastics from stomachs. Early publications indicated long residence
times for plastics in seabird stomachs, Day et al. (1985) suggesting
an average of 6 months or more for plastic particles to disappearthrough wear in the gizzard and subsequent passage through the
gut, while Ryan and Jackson (1987) estimated a half-life of at least
one year for plastic granules in the stomachs of White-chinned
Petrels Procellaria aequinoctialis . However, these are probably
serious overestimates. van Franeker and Bell (1988) observed that
Cape Petrels Daption capense returning to clean Antarctic waters
after wintering in northern, more polluted environments lost80e90% of plastics from their stomachs in just over a month. As
described in the Online supplement, disappearance rates for squid
beaks in several species of Antarctic fulmarine petrels ( van
Franeker et al., 2001 ) and datasets on plastics in high Arctic Cana-
dian fulmars ( Mallory, 2008 ) and thick-billed murres Uria lomvia(Provencher et al., 2010 ) accord with such rapid rates of disap-
pearance. From these data, disappearance rates of plastics fromstomachs can be conservatively estimated at over 75% per month.
In the North Sea, where soft foamed and sheet-like plastics are
commonly ingested, disappearance may be considerably faster, and
it is reasonable to assume that fulmars lose or accumulate char-
acteristic local pollution levels within time frames of at most a very
few weeks or even a number of days.
The main purpose of this paper was to provide insight into the
reliability of the Fulmar EcoQO approach as a scientiﬁ c instrument
for policy decisions concerning marine litter. Nevertheless, majorconclusions on trends, regional patterns, sources of litter and
potential meaning for policy decisions should be discussed here
too.
Within the Dutch time series, the pattern of plastic litter,
peaking in the 1990s followed by a sharp downward trend back to
earlier levels, appears dominated by a high ﬁgure for 1997 ( Fig. 4 ).
Nevertheless if in the standard 10-year analysis (1997 e2006
decrease p<0.001) all 1997 data are left out, the trend remains
signiﬁcant (1
998e2006 decrease p¼0.003). In arithmetic annual
averages for mass of plastics ( Supplement Table 1 ) the value for the
large 1998 sample exceeds that for 1997, indicating that the pattern
is not caused by a single odd year.
The most remarkable change in the long term dataset concerns
the reduced pollution by industrial plastic, unfortunately
compensated for by an increase in user plastic debris (Fig. 2 .). This
phenomenon was previously documented by van Franeker and
Meijboom (2002) and has also been observed in the north Paci ﬁc
(Vlietstra and Parga, 2002 ), and in the south Atlantic and southwest

Fig. 3. EcoQO performance in North Sea regions 2003 e2007ePercentages of beached
fulmars having more than 0.1 g of plastic in the stomach over the 2003 e2007 5-year
period in different regions around the North Sea.J.A. van Franeker et al. / Environmental Pollution 159 (2011) 2609 e2615 2613Indian Ocean ( Ryan, 2008 ). The economic value of raw industrial
plastic may have been an incentive to reduce losses from industrial
processing plants and during transport. Increased container
transport as well as improved waste water treatment will have
reduced loss of granules to the environment. Unfortunately,
economic incentives are largely lacking as a stimulus to reduce the
discarding of consumer plastics. Consequently, the current overall
plastic pollution level may be similar to that in the 1980s, but its
composition and origin have changed markedly. Such ﬁndings
stress the importance of recording subcategories of plastics, even ifthe EcoQO considers all plastics together.
Being aware of the role of shipping, the European Commission
decided that global rules for ships in MARPOL Annex V were
insufﬁciently effective, and introduced a Directive to enhance
proper waste disposal at harbors ( EC, 2000 ). In the Netherlands, the
fulmar monitoring has been ﬁnanced as a tool to evaluate the
effectiveness of this Directive after its implementation in 2004. Asyet, fulmar data from the Netherlands show no signi ﬁcant
improvements in the marine litter situation in the North Sea sinceimplementation of the Directive, a ﬁnding corroborated by the
OSPAR Beach Litter Surveys (OSPAR, 2010a ). An evaluation of the
effectiveness of the Directive should, however, take into accountincreases in shipping traf ﬁc and in the proportion of plastics in
wastes.
The EcoQO target for ‘acceptable ecological quality ’has been
deﬁned by OSPAR as the situation where less than 10% of fulmars
carry more than 0.1 g of plastic ( OSPAR, 2008 ). In the North Sea,
currently 58% (48 e78% depending on area) of fulmars exceed this
level ( Table 2 ). The considerable gap between the current situation
and the target is of concern and raises the question of whether theEcoQO target is realistic, even in the long term (no target date was
set by OSPAR). The Save the North Sea study has used stomachs of
fulmars from the Faroe Islands as an outside reference; currently
44% of Faroe birds exceed the critical level of 0.1 g of plastic ( Fig. 5
and details in Online supplement). At present, the EcoQO target is
only approached by fulmars in the eastern Canadian Arctic, where
data suggest regional averages of 40% incidence, 2.5 particles and
0.03 g per bird, and 14% of birds exceeding 0.1 g of plastic in the
stomach (Mallory et al., 2006; Mallory, 2008; Provencher et al.,
2009 ). The true local pollution level is probably lower, because
some birds were sampled early in the breeding season and prob-ably contained plastics from wintering areas further south (see
Discussion on disappearance rates in Online supplement).Increased pollutant loads have been observed in soils below higharctic breeding colonies of fulmars ( Choy et al., 2010 ), in which
a contribution from excrement containing digested plastics seemsa reasonable assumption. The long term OSPAR EcoQO target for
the North Sea can be seen as realistic, because the target level
already exists in relatively clean areas of the North Atlantic.
The EcoQO approach for the North Sea has also been adopted as
an indicator for Good Environmental Status (GES) in the European
Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) ( EC, 2008; Galgani
et al., 2010; EC, 2010 ). In some European marine areas the Fulmar
EcoQO is directly applicable, although copying the undated OSPAR
target to the MSFD date of 2020 could be considered too ambitious.
If so, an alternative target such as a ‘signiﬁcant ’or‘ﬁxed percentage’
decre
ase could be formulated for the short-term. Fulmars do not
inhabit all the regions covered by the MSFD and feasibility studies
of plastic ingestion by other seabird species, marine mammals, sea-
turtles, ﬁsh or invertebrates will be needed to establish a Europe-
wide monitoring system for the impacts of marine litter.
Marine organisms like the fulmar continuously integrate litter
levels in their environment in a way that is virtually impossible toreplicate by direct physical measurements ( Ryan et al., 2009 ).
EcoQO trends ( Fig. 1 ) and patterns ( Fig. 3 ) provide policy makers
with a statistically robust basis for urgently needed managementdecisions aiming at improving the quality of European marine
environments.
Acknowledgements
Fulmar monitoring in the Netherlands is supported ﬁnancially
by the Netherlands Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment.
The international part of the study developed during the Save the
North Sea campaign 2002e 2004, which was co-funded by the EU
Interreg IIIB program for the North Sea. The idea of an EcoQO basedon the abundance of plastics in seabird stomachs was initiated by
the ICES Working Group on Seabird Ecology and guided in several
workgroups within ICES and OSPAR. Continuation of the interna-
tional fulmar work up to the analyses of data from 2007 was sup-
ported by the NYK Group Europe Ltd. Preliminary data from the
Faroe Islands in this report were derived from an ongoing diet and
litter study funded by Chevron Upstream Europe, supported in the
ﬁeld by Poul-Johannes Simonsen. Mark Mallory and Jennifer Pro-
vencher provided unpublished details of their Canadian data. GeertAarts advised on statistics for regional differences.
Beached fulmars are mainly collected by volunteers, too many to
be named individually, but without whom a project such as this
would have been impossible. This publication is therefore dedi-
cated to all our helpers around the North Sea.
