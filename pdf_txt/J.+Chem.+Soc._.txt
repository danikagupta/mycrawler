Abstract
A deceptively simple mixture, ferrous sulfate (FeSO 4), hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2),
tartaric acid (C 4H6O6), and water (H 2O), initiated a century-long argument and a
convoluted hunt to understand the oxidation mechanism(s) initiated by the combi-nation of these components. Fenton ’s discovery rallied a legion of scientists, including
two Nobel Winners, to find an explanation for the chemistry discovered when a
graduate student mixed a couple of random chemicals, producing a molecule that
became purple in strong base. Those investigation uncovered three separate branchesof iron/oxygen chemistry, the Hydroxyl Radical [HO ], the Ferryl-Oxo Ion [Fe = O]
+2,
and the Perferryl-Oxo Ion [Fe = O]+3. Today their uses include chemical modifications
[either untargeted and random [HO ] or targeted and selective [Fe = O]+2, [Fe = O]+3
dehydrogenations and/or oxygen additions] to effective and green oxidation and
mineralization of persistent organic wastes.

1. Introduction
The Initial Experiments. In 1876, Henry John Horstman Fenton first discovered the
enhanced oxidizing power of ferrous ions (Fe+2), hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2)o n
tartaric acid (C 4H6O6). When Fenton added sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to the mix-
ture, the solution became bright purple [1]. Fenton made a decision to find out what
that purple molecule was. That goal became his career and immortalized his name in
the annals of chemistry [2].
Eighteen years later, Fenton repeated the experiment, again adding to a tartaric
acid solution, a catalytic amount of FeSO 4, followed by H 2O2with the molar ratio of
each factor: C 4H6O6/H2O2/F e+2= 1.0: 1.0: ‘catalytic ’. Fenton then isolated the
reaction product by sequentially precipitating the acid with heavy metal ions,weighing the salt to calculate the molar formula, re-purifying the acid, then repeatingthe process with a different cation, thus calculating the empirical formula of the new
acid. The new acid bound one divalent cation ion or two monovalent cations ions per
molecule, and thus was a di-acid. Fenton determined: 1) the molecule had the empir-ical formula C
4H4O6; 2) was a 4-carbon di-acid; 3) produced by abstraction of two
hydrogen atoms from tartaric acid [3].
1Fenton (1896) assumed that the 4-chain backbone was not severed, limiting his
options to three possible structures: 1) loss of two hydrogen from a single middle carbon,
forming a hydroxy-, keto-, di- carboxylic acid: (2-hydroxy-3-oxosuccinic acid); or 2) lossof two hydrogen from the internal adjacent carbon atoms forming a double bond withthe HO- groups either in: 2a) trans- conformation: 2-, 3-, di-hydroxyfumaric acid, or 2b)
cis-conformation: 2-, 3-, di-hydroxymaleic acid (Eq. (1)).
Fenton0sInitial  Guess  forC 6H4O6: (1)
The first structure was eliminated when the di-acid failed to form a hydrazone
with phenylhydrazine (an aldehyde/ketone reactive agent). The assumption that themolecule had two internal hydroxyl groups was verified when the molecule formed a4-carbon di-ester, di-anhydride with either acetyl chloride or acetic anhydride.
The structure of the molecule was finalized by reaction with aniline. Fenton knew
(from literature) that the 1:1 product of aniline and fumaric acid (C
4H2O4:
-C2H=H C 3-i ntrans- ) was soluble in water, whereas the 1:1 product of aniline and
maleic acid (C 4H2O4,- C 2H=HC 3-i ncis) was insoluble in water. The aniline derivative
of the unknown acid was also insoluble in water. Fenton concluded that Fe+2/H2O2
oxidized tartaric acid to 2-, 3-, di-hydroxy-maleic acid: a loss of two H atoms in cis-
orientation, forming a double bond and creating a previously unknown molecule [4].
2. Early Fe+2/H2O2investigations
Following the initial discovery, Fenton tested the range of his new reagent. Fenton
& Jackson (1899) oxidized aliphatic alcohols, polyalcohols, and benzoic, then FeSO 4
followed by H 2O2, added stepwise, in molar ratios of (1: 0.1 –0.25: 1), adding the
peroxide gradually in small amounts.
The aliphatic alcohols: (CH 3OH, CH 2CH 5OH, n-C3H7OH, i-C3H7OH, and
n-C 5H11OH), did not produce any visible changes in temperature or precipitates with
phenylhydrazine, therefore Fenton assumed that these molecules were non-reactive[5]. Merz & Waters (1947) commented that the 1:1 alcohol: H
2O2ratio used in the
experiments by Fenton & coworkers was so high that the alcohols were oxidizeddirectly to organic acids. Fenton & coworkers would have discovered this result if: a)
they had assayed their samples for acids, and/or b) assayed the alcohols with different
concentrations of H
2O2] [6].
On the other hand, the polyalcohols (C 2H6O2,C3H8O3,C4H10O4,C5H12O5, and
C6H14O6) showed temperature increases and release of gases, whereas the H 2O2only
controls showed no reaction for either group. When the oxidized polyalcohols were
2Reactive Oxygen Speciesreacted with phenylhydrazine forming osazones, indicating that hydroxyl groups of
the polyols were oxidized to carbonyls, forming aldoses and/or ketoses. The oxidation
of hydroxyl groups in the polyalcohols to aldehydes or ketones required a loss of twohydrogen atoms (H ) from the molecular formula.
Benzoic acid (C
7H6O2) was oxidized to salicylic acid ( o-C7H6O3) as determined by a
robust violet color when ferric ion was added to the solution indicating that an exchange ofa -H atom with an -OH group adjacent to the -COOH on the benzene ring [5].
Fenton & Jones (1900) repeated testing the oxidizing abilities of Fe
+2/H2O2on a
larger set of aliphatic and polyhydroxy acids. Their method was to prepare a 1 M
solution of reagent in H 2O at 0°C, add FeSO 4to 0.125 M, then add H 2O2to 0.25 M
(-FeSO 4was the control). The authors again reported that aliphatic acids appeared
non-reactive while polyhydroxy acids showed vigorous and energetic reactions. Theoxidized acids reacted with phenylhydrazine, and the precipitates were purified bycrystallization, confirming that hydroxyl groups were oxidized to ketones or alde-hydes and the molecules identified by melting point determinations. The oxidation ofbenzoic acid to salicylic acid was also confirmed [7].
Collectively, Fenton (1896) and Fenton et al. (1899, 1900) presented evidence for
three different reactions: 1) carbon –carbon double bond formation with loss of 2 H-;
2) carbon –oxygen double bond formation with loss of 2 H- (both aldehydes and
ketones; and 3) oxygen addition to phenol.
2.1 Isolation of glucosones
Following Fenton ’s lead, Cross, Bevan, & Smith (1898) oxidized glucose with FeSO
4
/H2O2and isolated “glucosone ”(2-keto-, glucose). The experiment consisted of: 1) in
100 mL H 2O, 4% or 10% glucose; 2) FeSO 4added to a concentration of 1/104ratio with
glucose, and 3) H 2O2was gradually added to a final 1:1 molar glucose/ H 2O2with
stirring on ice [8]. Theorizing that 2-keto-, glucose would be indigestible, the authorsused yeast to scavenge unoxidized glucose. After filtering out the yeast, the authors
found that the solution still contained carbonyl molecules, as indicated by reduction of
CuO. The solution retained 20% of the reducing power of the original glucose solution.The oxidized glucose solution also increased in acidity. After drying (105°F / 40.6°C),the dried residue comprised 88% of the weight of glucose including 3.8% furfural.
The solids were resuspended in chilled water and reacted with phenylhydrazine
(PHZ), a reversible carbonyl-reactive label). The rationale was that while glucosoneand glucose are likely to be equally soluble in most solvents, the double substitutedglucosazone was expected to have a different solubility profile from the gluco-
hydrazone. The glucosone reacted with 2 moles of PHZ, whereas glucose reacts with
only one mole of PHZ, therefore their solubility in differences in organic solventswould be greater than the unlabeled molecules. After purification, PHZ-labeling wasreversed with H
2SO4, allowing analysis of purified glucosone. The authors repeated
their method with fructose and sucrose recovering only glucosone from all threesugars implying: 1) fructose oxidized to glucosone; and 2) sucrose hydrolyzed toglucose and fructose.
Morell et al. (1899 –1905) conducted a larger and more detailed survey of the
oxidation of monosaccharides to corresponding -osones with Fenton ’s reagent. Fol-
lowing Cross & Bevan ’s method [9 –14]. Morrell et al. (1899a) expanded the study of
the osones to include galactose, rhamnose, arabinose, and mannose [9].
Morrell et al. (1899b) increased glucose to glucosone yields by: 1) slow addition of
H
2O2, 2) controlling temperature with refrigeration, 3) controlling pH and precipitating

DOI: http:/ /dx.doi.org/10. 5772/intechopen.9 9846o r g a n i ca c i dw i t h( P b ( O A c ) 2). This method increased glucosone yield to 10%. Morell
et al. purified PHZ-glucosazone and PHZ-mannosazone from their corresponding PHZ-
hydrazones, but were not able to purify PHZ-arabinosazone, PHZ-rhamnosazone, andPHZ-galactosazone from their PHZ-hydrazone contaminants [10].
Morrell et al. (1900) oxidized glucose, fructose, arabinose, rhamnose, galactose,
maltose, lactose and sucrose, then labeled both aldoses and osones with PHZ. Theauthors increased purity by precipitating the saccharic acids with Pb(OAc)
2, while
controlling pH with Ba(OH) 2. PHZ-rhamnosazone was also separated from its
PHZ-hydrazone, but not galactose or arabinose [11].
Morrell et al. (1902) found that reacting a glucosone with bromine severed the C2-
C3 bond and oxidized C3 to a carboxylic acid, the final product being erythronic acid(trihydroxy-butyric acid), which was then dehydrated to butyric acid with nitric acid.The identity of erythronic acid was confirmed by calculating formula weights of thelead and barium salts [12].
Morell et al. (1903) oxidized aldoses with Fenton ’s reagent, precipitate organic
acids with Pb(OAc)
2and Ba(OH) 2, then label the oxidation mixture for carbonyl
groups with methyl-, phenyl-hydrazine (MPHZ). However, galactose and arabinose
MPHZ-osazones were not separable from their MPHZ-hydrazones. The authors tested
bromo-, phenylhydrazine (BPHZ) and found that BPHZ-arabinosazone was easilyseparable from BPHZ-arabinose hydrazone using benzene as the solvent [13].
Morrell & Bellars (1905) retested purification of all the aldose osazones with BPHZ.
BPHZ-labeling after Fenton oxidation allowed sharp separations of BPHZ -osazonesfrom the corresponding hydrazones in benzene, thus achieving the goal of acquiringpure osazones after Fe
+2/H2O2oxidation [14]. [Considering that both Cross & Bevan
(1898) and Morell et al. (1899) stated that the purified osones were tasted, the implica-
tion is that both groups were investigating the osones as non-caloric sweeteners].
2.2 Isolation of aldonic acids and other byproducts
Cross & Bevan (1898) surveyed the by-products yielded by Fenton oxidation of
aldoses to glucosones. The secondary products included: tartronic acid, ( /C248%), acetic
acid ( /C245%), formic acid ( /C2415%), and furfural(s) ( /C244%). Missing carbohydrate mass
was assumed to be lost as carbon dioxide (CO 2). The authors noted that Fenton
oxidation of glucose produced furfural, but fructose did not; on the other hand,glucose produced lower amounts of dicarboxylic acids and pentoses [8]. Cross &Bevan (1899) oxidized a 2% solution of furfural with H
2O2and a catalytic amount of
FeSO 4. Formic, acetic acid, and a red precipitate identified as pyromucic acid were
isolated. The authors also reported that Fe+2/H2O2oxidized benzene to phenol,
followed by additional hydroxylations [15].
Morrell et al. (1903) used Pb(OAc) 2and Ba(OH) 2to precipitate the sugar acid
impurities in the quest to purify the osones. From the oxidation of glucose andfructose, the experimenters recovered the several polyhydroxy acids after precipita-tion with Pb
+2or Ba+2ions. After removal of Pb+2and Ba+2ions with H 2SO4, the
solubilized acids were identified as glycolic and oxalic. The Pb+2/B a+2soluble acids
were separately precipitated as calcium salts and identified as glyoxylic and
trihydroxy-butyric acids [13].
In sum, Cross & Bevan (1898, 1899) and Morrell et al. (1899 –1903) confirmed that
Fenton ’s reagent was responsible for the following reactions: dehydrations producing
C=C bonds, C-C bond cleavages, and oxygen atom additions forming hydroxyl, alde-hyde, ketone, and carboxylic acid groups, creating new classes of organic molecules.
4Reactive Oxygen Species3. Joint history of the hydroxyl radical and ferryl-oxo ion
Prof. Henry J. H. Fenton died in 1929 without knowing the mechanism of the
reagent that he discovered. Within three years of his death, two competingmechanisms naming two different intermediate molecules were published.
3.1 Hydroxyl radical
In 1932, Fritz Haber & Joseph Weiss (1932) published in Naturwissenschaften
(Science of Nature), and again in Proceedings of the Royal Society of London: A
(1934), that the hydroxyl radical (HO ) is the oxidative intermediate responsible for
Fenton ’s observation.
The authors proposed that the Fe
+2ion donates an electron to the peroxide mole-
cule, cleaving the O-O bridge producing a hydroxyl radical (HO ) and a hydroxide ion
(HO/C0). The hydroxyl radical then attacks another peroxide molecule, forming super-
oxide, eventually generating oxygen [16, 17].
3.2 Ferryl-oxo ion
On the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, William Bray & H. M. Gorin published in
Journal of the American Chemical Society (1932) that oxygen production after additionof Fe
+2ions to H 2O2in H 2O is due to creation of the ferryl-oxo ion (Fe = O)+2
(Figure 2 ). After creation, the ferryl-oxo ion then reacts with another ferryl-oxo mole-
cule to produce oxygen gas, recycling the ferrous ion. The authors proposed that anoxygen atom ( O) is abstracted by a Fe
+2ion from the peroxide molecule, forming the
ferryl-oxo ion (Fe = O+2) (no net change in charge) and H 2O [18].
[Bray & Gorin named the molecule ‘ferryl ion ’, but the term is currently used for
the Fe+4ion (without oxygen) [19]. To avoid confusion, the Bray & Gorin molecule is
named here ‘ferryl-oxo ’ion. For similar reason, Barton ’s‘perferryl ion ’will be named
‘perferryl-oxo ion ’].
These two papers divided the scientific community into partisan camps with
sports-like fanaticism that continues today. Champions of the hydroxyl radical theoryinclude: JD Rush, WH Koppenol [20 –23], C. Walling [24 –26], M. Kremer [27 –29], JH
Merz, WA Waters, [6, 30, 31], as well as many others. The scientists who argued for
the existence of the ferryl-oxo ion included JT Groves [32 –35], DA Wink [36 –38], and
DT Sawyer [39], among many others.
3.3 Oxidative behavior of the hydroxyl radical
Only exceeded by a fluorine (F
0) atom, the powerful hydroxyl (HO ) radical is the
second strongest electrophile, and will even oxidize chlorine ion(s) (Cl/C0) to elemental
chlorine (Cl0) or gas (Cl 2) [40]. A hydroxyl radical will strip an electron from an
element (except F/C0)o rH from a hydrocarbon ( Figure 1 ).
Hydroxyl radicals (HO :Figure 1 ) are created by:
1.Donation of an electron to H 2O2from a transition metal ion ( Figure 1a ) (with
exception of iron and copper ions [41]) produces HO radicals via secondary
electron transfer from the ion to peroxide. The O-O bond of peroxide scissions,producing a hydroxyl ion (HO
—) and hydroxyl radical (HO );

(See (Eq. (2)) ( Figure 1d ) [42];

atoms ( O) that react with water molecules:

(Eq. (4)) [42];
(Hradicals likely combine with each other, as also H/C0&H+ions; thus escaping as
H2gas) [42, 45].
Once created, hydroxyl radicals (HO ) will oxidize an element, ion, or compound,
by extracting an electron to form HO/C0and a cation, increase the valence of another
ion by +1, or abstract H- from an X-H bond of organic molecule, forming H 2O and an
organic radical ( Figure 1e ).
Figure 1.
Hydroxyl radical reactions.
6Reactive Oxygen Species3.3.1 Oxidation of hydrocarbons (alkanes) by hydroxyl radicals
A hydroxyl radical abstracts H from an alkane to create a C radical and water
(Figure 1e ) [46, 47]. A second HO is required to collide with C to form an alcohol
(Figure 1f ), thus a high HO / substrate ratio is required to produce alcohols. Subse-
quent HO hydroxyl attacks to the same carbon atom progressively oxidizes and adds
oxygen atoms, producing aldehydes/ketones, then organic acids, and finally, carbondioxide [31, 42, 48]. An example of a hydroxyl radical reaction sequence for oxidation
of methane:
1ðÞHOþCH
4!CH 3þH2O;
2ðÞHOþCH 3!CH 3OH
3ðÞCH 3OHþHO!CH 2O
4ðÞCH 2OþHO!HCO 2
5ðÞHCO 2þHO!CO 2þH2O(5)
Sequential Oxidation of Methane to Carbon Dioxide by Hydroxyl Radicals
(Eq. (5)) ( Figure 1f ) [25].
There is no guarantee that a second HO will collide with a carbon radical to make
an alcohol.
Under low HO concentrations, long-lived hydrocarbon radicals fuse to each other
to make large complex hydrocarbons via R 1CCR2fusions ( Figure 1g ). The hydroxyl
radical oxidation of methane can also follow:
1ðÞHOþCH 4!CH 3þH2O;
2ðÞCH 3þCH 3!CH 3/C0CH 3(6)
Partial Oxidation of Methane by Hydroxyl Radicals Allow C ‐C Fusions
(Eq. (6)) ( Figure 1g ) [25].
Thus carbon –carbon fusions are a hallmark of hydroxyl radical reactions [42, 49].
The HO radical is: 1) uncharged, and 2) will abstract an electron any atom (except
F/C0)o rH from a molecule it collides with, thus the (HO ) radical is an indiscriminant
oxidant. Its oxidation profile determined by accessibility and rate of diffusion. In the
oxidation of simple alkanes, the oxidation preference is: 1° H >2° H>3 H°.
Hydroxyl radicals (HO ) [17] can be created by H 2O2receiving an electron from a
transition metal ion [41], or by splitting an oxygen donating molecule, either H 2O2,
with UV light or radiation [42, 50] or N 2O (aq.) with UV light [43, 44]. Hydroxyl
radicals can be quenched/scavenged by reducing agents [51] including aliphatic alco-hols [50], DMSO [52], acetate ions [22], polyols [53], H
2S [54], and NO [55]. These
reagents are included as radical traps where HO radical oxidations are undesirable.
3.3.2 Hydroxyl radical oxidation of alcohols
Waters (1946) reported that HO radical oxidation of ethylene glycol (CH 2(OH)-
CH 2(OH)) produced both glycoaldehyde (CH(O)-CH 2(OH)) and formaldehyde (2x:
CH 2O). To determine which H abstraction caused C-C bond cleavage, Waters
7A History of the Fenton Reactions (Fenton Chemistry for Beginners)
DOI: http:/ /dx.doi.org/10. 5772/intechopen.9 9846oxidized pinacol, which has no available O- C-H bonds, to acetone ((CH 3)2C=O) as the
only product. Thus, Waters (1946) proved that H abstraction from the hydroxyl
oxygen (H-C- O-H) bond of a 1-, 2-, diol causes C-C bond cleavage, and H abstraction
from an H-C-O-H bond of a 1-, 2-, diol causes localized C=O bond formation [56] (see
ferryl-oxo ion: Figure 2c andd).
Droege & Tully (1986a,b) oxidized gaseous ethane (1H,2H, and mixed) (46)] and
propane (1H,2H, and mixed) [47] with UV-activated N 2O&H 2O to compare oxida-
tion rates of the terminal vs. center carbons, and test the isotope effect on HO 
oxidation for different positions of the ethane and propane molecules. The authorsfound that there was no difference in positional abstraction for hydrogen vs. deute-
rium at 1° (ethane & propane) or 2° positions (propane only); however C-C chain
fusions increased with temperature.
Baxley & Wells (1998) oxidizing tertiary alcohols with HO radicals in air. HO 
radicals were generated by UV activation of CH
3ONO, NO, and O 2gases. H-abstraction
from the sole -OH group caused C-C cleavage producing a ketone, a hydrocarbon andwater. Abstractions from C-H bonds produced either addition of a second hydroxylgroup or fusions producing long chain diols, however the authors noted that thehydroxyl group of 2-butanol was targeted more frequently than of 2-pentanone [48].
3.3.3 Hydroxyl radical oxidation of diols, polyols, and carbohydrates
Gilbert and King (1981, 1984) oxidized glucose with HO generated by Ti
+3/H2O2.
Using electron spin resonance (ESR) the authors concluded that HO radical produced
Figure 2.
Ferryl-Oxo ion reactions.
8Reactive Oxygen Speciescarbon (C ) radicals at all positions in equal ratios, indicating distributed attack by
HOtoward all carbon positions in glucose, the established signature of HO oxida-
tions [57, 58].
Dizdaroglu & Von Sonntag reacted glucose [43] and cellobiose (44) with HO 
generated from UV irradiation of N 2O saturated H 2O. By mass spectroscopy, the
authors identified several 6-carbon derivatives of glucose including gluconic andglucuronic acids, several hexosuloses, hexodialdose, and. Several dehydro-hexoaldoses, proposing that addition of H or HO radicals occurred after abstraction
of–Ho r –OH groups from glucose. The authors determined for both carbohydrates,
all carbons were oxidized equally.
In addition to 6-carbon molecules, Von Sonntag and coworkers reported fragmen-
tation of glucose into various aldoses, formaldehyde, formic acid, carbon dioxide, andcarbon monoxide, representing different C-C bond cleavages. The authors did notexplain the origins of the C-C bond cleavage products.
In summary, the hydroxyl radical (HO ) is a powerful but non-selective oxidant. It
can abstract electrons from any molecule or element with exception of fluorine.Hydroxyl radicals will abstract hydrogen atoms (H ) from organic molecules from any
accessible C-H, O-H, or N-H (59) bond at rates proportional to accessibility by simple
diffusion [43, 46, 57].
3.4 Oxidative behavior of the ferryl-oxo ion
The ferryl-oxo [(Fe = O)
+2] ion, a less powerful oxidant than the HO radical, is
created by oxygen abstraction from H 2O2(Figure 2a ). The oxidizing power of the
(Fe = O)+2ion is moderately stronger than the strength of C-H bond of an alkane and
roughly equivalent to the C-H bond strength of benzene; the (Fe = O)+2ion is reported
not to abstract H from anhydrous acetonitrile (CH 3-C/C17N) [59]. Though weaker than
the HO radical, the (Fe = O)+2ion is a discriminatory oxidant, abstracting H from the
weakest X-H bond in a molecule and oxidizing molecules with the weakest X-H bondsin a mix of molecules ( Figure 2b )[ 3 2 –35]. In the oxidation of simple alkanes, the
oxidation preference is: 3° H >2° H>1° H ( Figure 2 ).
3.4.1 Ferryl-oxo ion oxidation of hydrocarbons (alkanes)
Groves & coworkers demonstrated that oxidation of alkanes by (Fe = O)
+2in non-
aqueous environments produced alcohols without carbon –carbon fusions. Addition of
-OH groups to alkanes was both regio- andstereo- selective. Using isotopic H 218O2/
H216O, Groves and coworkers found that the peroxyl oxygen was incorporated as the
hydroxyl oxygen 90% of the time. Groves et al. termed the effect ‘oxygen rebound ’
[32–35].
Groves et al. proposed a two-step mechanism to explain their results ( Figure 2b ):
1.The ferrous ion abstracts oxygen from peroxide forming the ferryl-oxo ion with a
coordinate double bond;
2.The ferryl-oxo ion [(Fe = O)+2] abstracts H from a C-H bond creating a C 
radical and ferric hydroxide [(Fe+3OH) or (Fe-OH)+3](Figure 2b );
3.The oxygen of ferric hydroxide (Fe+3OH) reacts with the C radical, producing
an alcohol (RC-OH), and regenerating the Fe+2ion.
9A History of the Fenton Reactions (Fenton Chemistry for Beginners)
DOI: http:/ /dx.doi.org/10. 5772/intechopen.9 9846Unlike HO , the [Fe = O]+2is both stereo- and regio- selective. For hydrocarbons,
the H-C oxidation preference order is: 3° C-H >2° C-H >1° C-H. The basis of the
rebound effect is likely due to attraction of the electrophile C radical and the nucle-
ophile oxygen ( O) of the (Fe-OH)+3ion. The oxygen is added to the same bond
position on the oxidized carbon.
[Fenton ’s original reaction: (Eq. (7)) violates Groves ’model because tartaric acid
oxidation follows a different pathway:
C4H6O4þFeSO 4þH2O2þH2O!C4H4O4þ2H2O
Fenton ’s First Reaction :Oxidation of Tartaric Acid by FeSO 4=H2O2 (7)
Erik Hückel ’s double bond resonance theory states that molecules with 4N + 2
unpaired electrons in conjugated (staggered) double bonds are extraordinarily
stable. In the oxidation of tartaric acid, the abstraction of the first H from C2 is
followed by ejection of the second H from C3 to form a C=C bond, because the
central C=C bond is conjugated to the flanking C=O bonds of the terminal carboxylicacids. Thus, Fenton ’s molecule was resistant to further oxidations, allowing him to
discover it].
3.4.2 Ferryl-oxo ion oxidization of alcohols
Ferryl-oxo ion [(Fe = O)
+2] oxidation of oxygen-containing organic molecules
behaves differently from hydrocarbon oxidations ( Figure 2c andd). Carbon and
hydrogen have similar affinity for electrons, therefore the electron pair is sharedequally and in a hydrocarbon, hydrogen-carbon all bonds are about equal strengths.Oxygen (O) heteroatoms have a higher affinity for electrons than carbon or hydrogenatoms, making the C-O bond stronger than a C-C bond, while weakening other bondsextending from the hydroxyl carbon significantly [19, 60 –62].
As an example, when (HO ) oxidizes ethanol, H abstraction occurs indifferently
from any of the six C-H positions, producing roughly 50% ethylene glycol and 50%
acetaldehyde yield. On the other hand, when ethanol is oxidized by (Fe = O)
+2ion, the
bond strengths of the methyl C-H bonds are /C2496 kCal/mole, whereas the hydroxyl C-
H bond strengths are /C2481.6 kCal/mol and the O-H bond strength is /C24104 kCal/mole
(60). Because the (Fe = O)+2ion has the higher probability of abstracting H from a
hydroxyl carbon (due to bond strength) or hydroxyl oxygen (due to charge attrac-tion) rather methyl carbons, acetaldehyde will be formed in preference to ethyleneglycol [60, 63 –66].
3.4.3 Ferryl-oxo ion oxidation of diols, polyols, and carbohydrates
Following the Coon & White (1977) discovery of the Fe
+3-heme core in cyto-
chrome P450 and its ability to sever the O-O bond, and oxidize NADPH 2[67, 68],
Okamoto et al. (1985) mimicked the ability of enzyme P450 sccto split a C-C bond of a
diol in 1-, 2-, bis-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethane-l,2-diol using Fe+3ion, O 2, and a
reductant (N-benzyl-3-carbamoyl-1,4-dihydropyridine) [69].
Okamoto et al. (1988) found that Fe+2+H 2O2could substitute for Fe+3and O 2to
cleave diols to paired aldehydes. Using various inhibitors and/or substituting ferric forferrous ion, the authors concluded that (Fe = O)
+2was created and was the oxidant
that cleaved the 1-, 2-, diols ( Figure 2c ). The authors also discovered that when one
10Reactive Oxygen Specieshydroxyl group was substituted, paired aldehydes formed, but when both hydroxyl
groups were blocked, no aldehydes were produced ( Figure 2d ) [70].
Sugimoto and Sawyer (1985a) reported that Fe+2and two moles of H 2O2oxidized
alkenes (hydrocarbons with double bonds) to paired aldehydes formed by (Fe = O)+2.
The authors proposed that Fe+2ion and H 2O2caused dioxygen addition to a double
bond, forming a dioxetane, that then scissioned to a diol; a second oxidation (Fe = O)+2
scissioned the diol to paired aldehydes. The authors saw similar oxidative behaviorwhen CH3-O-O-H and p-Cl-Ph-O-O-H were substituted for H
2O2[71].
Thus 1-, 2-, diols produce the same products when oxidized by either HO (56) or
(Fe = O)+2[68] oxidants indicating that the formation of paired aldehydes is faster
than oxygen addition reactions of alkanes. [Though contemporary, the Sawyer ’s and
Oka ’s research teams did not appear to be aware of each other, or of Waters (1946)].
The rationale for asymmetric cleavage of diols ( Figure 2c andd) is due to the
additive weakening of the C-C bond between the two hydroxyl groups [19, 60,61, 65]. When H is abstracted from a hydroxy oxygen of a diol pair, the weakest bond
of the oxygen-centered (H-C-O ) carbonyl radical is the C-C bond between the diol
pair ( O-R
1CH/C24R2CH-OH); electron abstraction from the C /C24C bond produces
paired aldehydes ( Figure 2c ). However, when H is abstracted from a C-H bond of a
hydroxyl carbon, the weakest bond of the diol group is the O-H bond opposite the C 
radical (H /C24O-R 1C); the hydrogen atom is ejected from carbon-centered (H /C24O-C )
carbonyl radical to form the carbonyl bond. Abstraction of H from a tertiary -OH
group can cause ejection of a C radical to form the C=O bond ( Figure 2d ) [60 –66].
[Fenton ’s oxidation of tartaric acid should have produced two products: 2-, 3-,
dihydroxy-, maleic acid [HOOC-C(OH) = C(OH)-COOH] andglyoxalic acid [HO-
C(O)-C(O)H. Waters (1946), Okamoto et al. (1988), and Sugimoto et al. (1984,
1985a) indicates that Fenton could have discovered both oxidation products].
3.5 Comparison of ferryl-oxo ion and hydroxyl radical oxidizations
Though HO radical and (Fe = O)+2ion both create a C radical, the differences
between the two oxidants is: 1) HO is a 1 e/C0oxidant, whereas (Fe = O)+2ion is a 2 e/C0
oxidant, thus two independent HO oxidations are required to make a hydroxyl group;
a n d2 )r e d u c i n ga g e n t st h a tt r a pH O radicals and thus halt HO -based oxidations, do not
disrupt ferryl-oxo ion oxidations. The most likely explanation radical quenching by theferryl-oxo ion is the proximate distance of Fe
+3-O-H and C radical is coupled with likely
nucleophile / electrophile attraction, allowing rapid re-reaction to occur [36 –38].
The noted crypto-HO positional effect seen in Fe+2/H2O2catalyzed oxidations is
likely due to localized binding of Fe+2ions to a substrate that has O heteroatoms when
it added to the substrate prior to H 2O2[22, 23, 72] addition.
4. Perferryl-oxo ion
4.1 Early history of the perferryl-oxo ion
Fenton conducted Fe+3/H2O2experiments but did not note any reactions and
assumed that no reaction(s) had occurred [5, 7]. However, on the other side of the
English Channel, Fenton ’s contemporaries found contrary evidence.
Spring (1895) mixed H 2O2solutions with different pure chemical substances not-
ing which substances caused oxygen gas release. Spring noted that both ferrous andferric chlorides decomposed H
2O2and released oxygen gas [40].
11A History of the Fenton Reactions (Fenton Chemistry for Beginners)
DOI: http:/ /dx.doi.org/10. 5772/intechopen.9 9846Ruff (1898) used basic ferric acetate and H 2O2to oxidize gluconic acid to arabinose
and carbon dioxide, a C 1-C2bond cleavage with oxidations of both C 1and C 2, the
reaction now known as ‘Ruff ’s degradation ’[73].
Bohnson (1921) noted that a solution of a ferric salt in water, dilute enough to show
only very slight color, turns brightly lavender with ‘1 or 2 drops ’of 30% H 2O2followed
by O 2gas release from the solution. After bubbling ends, no residual H 2O2remained in
the solution, indicating complete decomposition. The author observed that when H 2O2
is added to Fe+3salts, a lavender color appears briefly. Bohnson speculated that the color
represented a transient higher Fe oxidation state. Bohnson trapped the lavender pig-
ment with cold KOH coloring the solution red, then Ba(OH) 2, forming a red gelatinous
precipitate. Washing the precipitate with HCl released chlorine gas. Bohnson deter-mined the empirical formula of the precipitate: barium ferrate (BaFeO
4), thus isolating
the Fe+6oxidation state as FeO 4/C02(ferrate) ion. Bohnson also prepared potassium
ferrate (K 2FeO 4) by bubbling chlorine gas through a solution of Fe(OH) 3/KOH solution,
producing a deep lavender color; addition of Ba(Cl) 2to the lavender solution again
formed the red precipitate: BaFeO 4[74].
Bohnson (1921) also demonstrated direct conversion of ethanol to acetic acid.
Bohnson noted that addition of Fe+3ions to an H 2O2solution produced oxygen gas,
but addition of ethanol to the H 2O2solution prior addition of Fe+3ions disrupted
oxygen evolution, leading the author speculated that ethyl alcohol was oxidized toacetaldehyde or acetic acid. Bohnson also compared of oxidation by ethanol by Fe
+2/
H2O2vs. Fe+3/H2O2and found that Fe+2/H2O2produces acetaldehyde, then acetic acid,
whereas Fe+3/H2O2oxidized ethanol to acetic acid primarily, with only trace amounts
of acetaldehyde detected. Bohnson proposed that Fe+3/H2O2oxidized ethanol directly
to acetic acid, bypassing acetaldehyde formation [74].
Walton & Christensen (1926) compared the oxidation of ethanol with FeSO 4/H2O2
or Fe 2(SO 4)3/H2O2under anhydrous conditions. Separately assaying for acetaldehyde
and acetic acid, the authors noted that when ethanol is oxidized with FeSO 4/H2O2
acetaldehyde appeared before acetic acid, whereas when ethanol is oxidized byFe
2(SO 4)3/H2O2acetic acid appears long before acetaldehyde, proving that Fe+3/H2O2
oxidation exhibits non-Fenton-like behavior, thus confirming Bohnson (1921) [75].
Wieland & Franke (1928) reported that under strong acidic conditions Fe+3/H2O2
oxidized formic acid (HCOOH) to CO 2and H 2O, and dihydroxymaleic acid (HOOC-
(OH)C=C(OH)-COOH) to 2,3 dioxo-propanoic acid (HOOC-C(O)-C(O)-COOH) and
CO 2[76].
Goldschmidt & Pauncz (1933) investigated the Fe 2(SO 4)3/H2O2/ethanol reaction
and confirmed that ethanol was oxidized directly to acetic acid. The authors alsoexplained that Fenton & Jackson (1899) and Fenton & Jones (1900) did not detectaldehydes from aliphatic alcohols because the 1:1 molar ratio of H
2O2and alcohol was
sufficient to oxidize all the alcohol to organic acids [77].
Even as late as 1989, Fe+3/H2O2oxidation articles appeared noting unusual oxidations.
Sanderson et al. (1989) submitted a patent for co-synthesis of t-butanol and t-butyl
peroxide from t-butane by Fe+3/H2O2, showing addition of either a hydroxyl or a peroxyl
group to the 3° carbon without explanation of mechanism [78].
4.2 Oxidative behavior of the perferryl-oxo ion
White & Coon (1977) summarized the discovery of the mechanism of respiration by
mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome P450. Cytochrome P450 uses a Fe+3ion chelated in a
heme ring to conduct the reduction: (Eq. (8)) [67, 68].

Cytochrome P450Reduction  of NADPH 2with  Oxygen (8)
Responding to the discovery that the critical enzyme of respiration forms a
Fe+3= O intermediate to split the dioxygen molecule, Barton et al. (1983) sought to
mimic the biological reaction using chelated Fe+3ions and peroxide ion (O 2/C02)
instead of oxygen as a new process to oxidize hydrocarbons to alcohols. Working withalkanes (R1-CH
2-R2), Barton expected that pyridine-chelated Fe+3ions and potassium
peroxide (K 2O2) would produce alcohols ( Figure 3 ) [54].
What Barton did not expect was that the reaction produced a mix of alcohols
[R1-HC(OH)-R2] and ketones (R1-(C=O)-R2). Direct oxidation of hydrocarbons to
ketones, a single step 4e/C0oxidation and oxygen addition, was new to organic chemis-
try. For the oxidation of simple alkanes, the oxidation preference of the Fe+3/H2O2
oxidant is: 3° H >2° H>1 H°. Barton et al. (1983) also found that they could
manipulate the alcohol/ketone ratio by choosing iron chelators with different N/Oratios.
To understand the reaction mechanism, Barton and co-workers studied the oxida-
tion of adamantine (C
10H16, 4 tertiary, 6 secondary, 0 primary C-H groups). Despite
the preponderance of secondary carbons, Barton ’s reactant favored oxidation of ter-
tiary vs. secondary carbons by a 5:1 margin indicating that the oxidant behaved similar
to the ferryl-oxo ion, but single step ketone addition was never reported for (Fe = O)+2
oxidations [54].
Sugimoto & Sawyer (1985b) confirmed and extended Barton ’s findings by using
Fe+3and H 2O2to oxidize hydrocarbons molecules with double and triple bonds,
isolating epoxides (R1-C-O-C-R2) and oxetanes (R1-C-O/C0O-C-R2) [79].
Seven years elapsed until Barton and coworkers resolved the perferryl-oxo
structure and oxidation mechanism ( Figure 3 ).
Figure 3.
Perferryl-Oxo ion reactions.
13A History of the Fenton Reactions (Fenton Chemistry for Beginners)
DOI: http:/ /dx.doi.org/10. 5772/intechopen.9 9846Couching their model on the accepted behavior of Fe+3nucleus of cytochrome P450
[80–82], Barton et al. (1990) proposed (Fe = O)+3as the reaction product of Fe+3and
H2O2or Fe+2and O 2/C0(superoxide anion) ( Figure 3a ). [Barton et al. (1990 –8) wrote
the structure of the perferryl-oxo ion as [FeV=O]. The (FeV=O(/C02)) and (Fe = O)+3
formulas are equivalent for atoms, bonds, and net charge].
Barton et al. (1990): 1) proposed a bifurcated pathway leading either to alcohol or
ketone formation, showing that the alcohol/ketone ratio could be varied with additionof dianisyl telluride, and 2) determined that both alcohol and ketone formationoccurred in two steps, choosing different non-reversible paths at the second reaction
[83, 84].
Barton and Doller (1992) mapped out steps of the pathway of perferryl-oxo ion
oxidation of hydrocarbons ( Figure 3b –d):
Step 1 ( Figure 3b ): Formation of Fe
+4-C-R intermediate. Using diphenyl-
diselenide (Ph-Se-Se-Ph), or phenyl selenol (Ph-Se-H), Barton trapped the Fe+4-C-R
intermediate as a stable (Fe+3-Ph-Se-C-R) intermediate as detected by mass
spectroscopy (structure not specified).
Step 2 ( Figure 3c ): Oxygen Insertion to form Fe+3-O-O-C-R intermediate.
Comparing16O2and18H2O2,the authors detected primarily16O-labeled alcohols and
ketones indicating that O 2(not O 2/C02) formed the dioxygen bridge. The authors pro-
posed that in an anoxic environment, peroxide is oxidized to dioxygen by ferric ionsin sufficient quantities to complete the reaction as follows: [Eq. (9)]
2Fe
þ3þO2/C02!2Feþ2þO2
Reduction  of H 2O2toO 2byFerric  Ions (9)
Step 3 ( Figure 3d (1 & 2)): Bifurcated Pathways Arise from Differential Cleavage
of the O-O Bridge. The Fe+3-O-O-C-R intermediate is the branch point between the
2e- and 4e- oxidative pathways: a) scission of the Fe+3-O-|-O-R bond produces an
alkoxide (R-O―) and the (Fe = O)+3ion (Figure 3d .1); b) scission of the Fe+3-|-O-O-R
bond produces Fe+3ion and a peroxyl (―O-O-R) ion which then degrades to a ketone
(R = O), and an oxide ion (O/C02)(Figure 3d .2).
Barton and Doller (1992) trapped the ferric-peroxy-carbon (Fe+3-O-O-C-R) cleav-
age intermediates with tri-methoxy phosphine (P(OMe) 3). P(OMe) 3reacted with
either oxygen (R-C-O*-O-Fe+3or R-C-O-O*-Fe+3) trapping potential oxygen bridge
cleavage products as R-C-O-P(OMe) 3and R-C-O-O-P(OMe) 3respectively. Thus Bar-
ton and Doller (1992) explained the mechanism of bifurcated production of alcoholsor ketones from alkanes by perferryl-oxo (Fe = O)
+3ion (85). Barton ’s oxidation
scheme was confirmed by Schuchardt et al. (2001) [55].
Barton ’s perferryl-oxo ion oxidation theory explains Ruff ’s oxidation gluconic acid
to arabinose (1898) [71] the one-step conversion of ethanol to acetic acid observed byBohnson (1921) [72], Walton & Christensen (1926) [75], Goldschmidt & Pauncz
(1933) [75], and the co-synthesis of t-butanol and t-butyl peroxide from t-butane by
Sanderson (1989) [76].
4.3 Comparison of (Fe = O)
+2and (Fe = O)+3ion chemistry
Both (Fe = O)+2(Figure 2 ) and (Fe = O)+3ions ( Figure 3 ) abstract H from the
weakest C-H bond present in a molecule to form ferric (Fe+3OH) or ferryl hydroxide
(Fe+4OH) and a C radical respectively [85].
14Reactive Oxygen SpeciesThe electrophilic ferric and ferryl hydroxides react ‘instantaneously ’with the
nucleophilic C radical, but the resulting intermediates are different. Ferric hydroxide
donates HO to the C radical, regenerating the ferrous ion, ending the cycle [33],
however the ferryl atom attacks the C radical (ejecting the hydroxyl group) to form
the ferryl-carbon (Fe+4-C) intermediate [83]. Oxygen (O 2) insertion into the (Fe+4-C)
bond creates the bifurcated oxidative pathways not available to either ferryl-oxo ionor hydroxyl radical [86].
Sugimoto et al. (1987), using
2H and18O labeled ethanediols, determined that H 
abstraction by (Fe = O)+3from the hydroxyl oxygen of a diol group [R 1-HC(O H)-HC
(OH)-R 2] causes C-C bond cleavage, producing paired aldehydes [R 1-HC=O + R 2-
HC=O], whereas H abstraction from the carbon backbone produces hydroxy-ketones
[R1-C(O)-HC(OH)-R 2] [87].
5. Mixed Fenton oxidation systems
5.1 Untangling oxidation behaviors arising when Fe+2ions, H 2O2, and H 2O are
present
The Fenton reaction (Fe+2+H 2O2+H 2O) has been shown to generate three
powerful oxidants: 1) (HO ) radical [16, 17]; 2) (Fe = O)+2ion [18]; and 3) [Fe = O]+3
ion [86, 88].
Sugimoto & Sawyer (1985a & 1985b) proposed that both ferrous and ferric ions
can abstract an Oatom from H 2O2, thus explaining how ferrous and ferric sponta-
neously reorganize to form the secondary oxidants ferryl (Fe = O)+2and perferryl
(Fe = O)+3ions, respectively.
Sugimoto and Sawyer (1984) and (1985b) compared (Fe = O)+2and (Fe = O)+3
oxidations, respectively, in anhydrous CH 3CN or 90% CH 3CN/10% H 2O with several
organic and inorganic molecules. In anhydrous CH 3CN, ferryl-oxo ions oxidation
produced only 2-electron oxidations, primarily dehydrations or hydroxyl additions,while perferryl-oxo ions produced both 2-, and 4- electron oxidations. Neither oxidantproduced 1- electron oxidations.
In aqueous acetonitrile (CH
3CN/H 2O), single electron oxidations, characteristic of
HOwere observed including: 1) carbon –carbon fusions; 2) oxidation of Fe+2ions; and
3) reduction of Fe+3ions to Fe+2ions. The authors proposed that HO radicals are
created by ferryl-oxo and perferryl-oxo ions only when water is present, implying thatHabstraction from water produces HO radicals via the formula: (Fe = O)
+2,+3+H 2O
HO+F e(+3,+4)OH [59, 61].
Sawyer et al. (1993) tested the oxidizing capability of Fe+2ions and organic perox-
ides (R-O-O-H) 1) under anhydrous conditions in the presence vs. absence of O 2, and
2) under anoxic conditions with anhydrous (Fe+2) or partially hydrated (Fe+2(H2O)2)
conditions. The authors found evidence of 1e―oxidations either when O 2or H 2O2
were present, indicating 1) that (Fe = O)+2reacted with H 2O to form HO radicals, or
2) with O 2, creating O 2[16], which then reacted with (R-O-O-H) to generate HO 
radicals [39]. On the other hand, Hage et al. (1995) found that in the conversion ofbenzene to phenol, if a small amount of H
2O was added, the efficiency of conversion
was increased, but other 1e―signature products were not detected [89].
Sawyer et al. (1996) surveyed the oxidizing abilities of Fe+2,+3,C u+2,C o+2, and
Mn+2ions in anhydrous solvents with ROOH, with/out O 2. Under an argon atmo-
sphere, only the hydroxyl radical sources produced chain fusion events, none of the
15A History of the Fenton Reactions (Fenton Chemistry for Beginners)
DOI: http:/ /dx.doi.org/10. 5772/intechopen.9 9846ions did. When air (20% O 2) was substituted, all of the ions showed oxidation patterns
consistent with HO radicals. The authors concluded that the metal ions, activated by
peroxide, reacted with solubilized O 2, producing superoxide (O 2/C0or HO 2), which in
turn reacted with H 2O2to generate reactive singlet oxygen ( O) which then reacts
with R-C-H to produce HO radicals [41].
Barton et al. (1995, 1996) seconded the research of Sawyer ’s group, confirming that
absent H 2O, ferryl-oxo and perferryl-oxo ions perform distinct and distinctive 2- (and
4-) electron oxidations without mixing the unique chemistries of either ion [86, 90].
Mwebi (2005) also confirmed that when Fe+2ions, H 2O2, and H 2O are reacted in
aqueous conditions, all three secondary oxidants [(Fe = O)+2, (Fe = O)+3, and HO ]
arise in that either (Fe = O)+2and (Fe = O)+3ions can abstract H from H 2O to create
the HO radical, the HO radical can oxidize Fe+2ions to Fe+3ions, and H 2O2can
reduce Fe+3ions to Fe+2ions [51].
5.2 Biological occurrence and utilization of the Fenton reagent
Oceans covered Earth 4.4 billion years ago [91], evidence of bacteria dates back 3.5
billion years ago (92), and evidence of oxygenic photosynthesis 2.3 billion years ago[91, 92]. From at least that time living organisms have evolved to defend against, and/or, utilize Fenton chemistry.
The use of the Fenton reagents to kill organisms or degrade biopolymers is widely
distributed in the biosphere. Saprophytic fungi use Fenton reagents to degrade poly-
saccharides of woody plant tissues [93], including cellulose [93 –96], callose [97], and
hemicelluloses [98].
On the other side of the eukaryote kingdom, mammalian leukocytes and neutrophils
pump Fe
+2ions [99, 100] and H 2O2into phagosomes to produce oxygen radicals [101] to
effect pathogen killing [102 –107]. For both nutrient mobilization and pathogen killing,
these oxidants target external glycan including cell walls to cause cell lysis and/or internalglycans such DNA and RNA to facilitate death of bacteria and eukaryote parasites.
Moore and coworkers incubated Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells with an Fe
+2-chelat-
ing anti-cancer medication. Treated and control cells were stained, fixed, and thin-sectioned for electron microscopy. While studying chromosome damage the authorsobserved damage to the yeast cell walls by the anti-cancer drug [108 –110].
Following Moore ’s lead, Lipke and coworkers treated
35S- l a b e l e d S. cerevisiae cells
with the an Fe+2-binding anti-cancer medication, then compared protein levels release
into growth media from treated and control cells [111], and cell lysis rates of treated andcontrol cells after adding Arthrobacter luteus (Zymolyase) protease [112].
In Lim et al. (1995), the authors noted that pretreatment with yeast cells with an
Fe
+2-binding anti-cancer agent increased cell lysis rates by Zymolyase protease with: 1)
Fe+2+O 2or Fe+3+O 2, but not Ca+2,C o+2,C u+2,M n+2,M g+2,a n dZ n+2ions; 2) H 2O2
could substitute for O 2; and 3) Fe+2/H2O2and Fe+3/H2O2alone also accelerated yeast cell
lysis; 4) H 2O2only controls did not accelerate Zymolyase lysis rates [112].
To understand the basis of cell wall weakening by Fe+2/H2O2,Ovalle et al. (2001)
elected to separately test pure analogs of carbohydrates and proteins found in yeastwall [113]. Ovalle et al. (2001) assumed that partial oxidation of fungal wall mono-
saccharides would oxidize hydroxyl groups to aldehydes and/or carboxylic acids and
developed a method for separating carbohydrates from 0 to 20 glucan units on poly-acrylamide gels. Surveying the available literature of the time, the authors followedthe method of Ahrgren et al. (1975) where dextran was preincubated with FeSO
4prior
to addition of H 2O2[114].
16Reactive Oxygen SpeciesOvalle et al. (2001) [113] labeled the aldehyde groups of glucose, maltose,
maltotriose and enzymatically digested laminaran with 8- amino, 1-, 3-, 6-, naphtha-
lene trisulfonate (ANTS) and NaCNBH3, by the method of Klock & Starr (1998)[115], to have glucan ladders to estimate degree of polymerization of carbohydratechains separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Ovalle et al. (2001) modifiedthe method Klock & Starr (1998) to visualize carboxylic acids and by quenchingaldehydes with NaBH4, then crosslinking ANTS to carboxylic acids with N-hydroxysuccinamide (NHS) and N-ethyl-N-(3-aminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC)[116]. Ovalle et al. (2001) separately visualized de novo aldehydes and de novo
carboxylic acids (after quenching aldehydes with NaBH
4) on 10% stacking/ 20%
running acrylamide gels.
Ovalle et al. (2020) [117] used the method of Ovalle et al. (2001) to determine
if Fe+2/H2O2would oxidize algal laminaran (d.p. ≈50–60 glucose units; 97 –99% β1–3
glu / 1 –3%β1–6 glu). To optimize metal ion-carbohydrate interactions, FeSO 4was
incubated with carbohydrate for 1 min prior to addition of H 2O2. The final ratio
(glucose monomer: Fe+2:H2O2= 10:1:1) was chosen to oxidize 10% of glucose mono-
mers and reduce the likelihood of a secondary oxidation of glucose fragments to 1%
maximum. Unoxidized laminaran did not enter that stacking gel. NaIO4/C0oxidized
laminaran entered the stacking gel but stopped at the stacking gel/running gel inter-face. Fenton-oxidized laminaran produced smears, when labeled for either aldehydeor carboxylate groups. Enzyme- (Zymolyase) digested laminaran were used as glucanladders when labeled for aldehydes or organic acids.
To label glucan fragments so as to be suitable for positive ion mass spectroscopy
[118, 119], Ovalle et al. (2020) substituted tert-butyl ester of tyrosine (TBT) for ANTSwith no other changes required. Ovalle et al. (2020) observed the elution of TBT-
labeled glucan fragments with masses consistent with six classes of TBT-labeled mol-
ecules: aldoses, dialdoses, uronic acids, hexosuloses, aldonic acids (unlabeled), andhexulosonic acids (unlabeled) ( Figure 4 ).
Figure 4.

17A History of the Fenton Reactions (Fenton Chemistry for Beginners)
DOI: http:/ /dx.doi.org/10. 5772/intechopen.9 98466. The authors concluded
1.Aldose / dialdose pairs arose from glucose by H abstraction from an
unsubstituted hydroxyl groups at O2, O4, or O6, and were mediated by[Fe = O]
+2ion after Fe+2ion was bound to a site where it was activated by H 2O2.
Diol-splitting reactions are consistent with oxidation by both HO and (Fe = O)+2
oxidants, however the ratios of the aldose / dialdose pairs were uneven, implying
bias oxidations, hallmark of the (Fe = O)+2ion.
2.Uronic and aldonic acids were produced by ketone addition to a hydroxyl carbon
(except at C1). The reaction is consistent with oxidation by Barton ’s perferryl-
oxo ion.
3.As ferric ions were not added to the assay, Fe+2ions must have been oxidized by
HOradicals.
4.Though present, the biased distribution of fragments excludes HO radicals as
the primary oxidant, HO radicals are partially credited for non-zero values of
infrequent carbohydrate fragments. Thus, Ovalle et al. (2020) observed all threeFenton oxidants directly or indirectly in the aqueous Fe
+2/H2O2oxidation of
laminaran.
6.1 Current applications of the Fenton oxidants
The Fenton Oxidants (HO ,F e=O+2, and Fe = O+3) are being investigated as
molecular scissors for insertion of reactive functional groups into otherwise inertsubstrates, such as carbohydrates. Oxidation of hydroxyl groups to carbonyl orcarboxylic acid groups will allow them to act as carriers for various molecules with
ramification in many sectors.
6.1.1 Hydroxyl radical oxidation of carbohydrates
Neyra et al. (2014, 2015) used a catalytic amount Fe
+2ions to produce HO radicals
from H 2O2to oxidize hydroxyl groups of acetylneuraminic acid monomers (2014) and
tetramers (2015) to carbonyl and/or carboxylic groups. The goal of the experimentwas to modify the sugars to create anchors for proteins so as to create vaccine adjuvantplatforms [120, 121].
6.1.2 Perferryl-oxo oxidations of carbohydrates
Sorokin et al. (2004), using ‘heme ’-chelated Fe
+3ions, oxidized glucose monomers
in starch fibers at C2 and C3 to produce acid / aldehyde pairs without hydrolyzing theflanking glycosidic bridges. The dual oxidations allow for two independent modifica-tions of the glucose monomers in the starch chain [122 –124].
6.1.3 Ozone-Fenton systems
Ozone (O
3) is being considered as an alternative to H 2O2. Ozone gas can be
activated by UV (O 3!O2+O) to produce oxygen radicals, or by reaction with iron
18Reactive Oxygen Speciesions (Fe+2,F e+3+O3!Fe = O+2,F e=O3++O 2, thus producing each Fenton oxidant
without water as a byproduct.
Pestovsky (2004, 2005, 2006) reacted Fe+2ion with O 3in aqueous buffer as an
alternative method of creating (Fe = O)+2ion. The signature of HO radicals: 1 e/C0
oxidations, were not detected for the oxidation of several classes of organic molecules
[125 –127].
Bataineh (2015a), and Bataineh et al. (2012, 2015b) compared the oxidation of
DMSO with Fe+2and O 3in aqueous phosphate vs. acetonitrile solvents. In acetonitrile
the primary product was DMSO 2, an oxygen addition reaction. In buffered H 2O,
ethane and methylsulfinate were the primary products, indicating fragmentation of
DMSO occurred by HO oxidation [128 –130].
Enami et al. (2014) fired microjets of aqueous FeCl 2into sprays of either O 2or O 3/
O2mixed gases. Particles detected by negative ion MS proved that Fe+2and O 3pro-
duces new particles not seen in FeCl 2or FeCl 2/O2sprays [131].
6.1.4 Fenton systems for bioremediation
Fenton oxidants are gaining popularity as agents of bioremediation because of
their ability to mineralize toxic organic molecules without contamination byecologically damaging elements (halogens, heavy metal ions, etc.).
6.1.4.1 Ozone (O
3) for bioremediation with (HO ) radical or (Fe = O)+3ion
Turan-Ertas & Gurol (2002) compared ozone (O 3) against Fe+3/H2O2in the degra-
dation of diethylene glycol [(HO-CH 2-CH 2)O], a toxic byproduct of the synthesis of
ethylene glycol. The authors compared the diethylene glycol oxidation profile by O 3and
Fe+3/H2O2. Both procedures were effective in degrading diethylene glycol, however the
Fe+3/H2O2oxidation produced fewer and simpler products [132].
7. Fenton chemistry for beginners
1.In 1894, John HJH Fenton published his discovery that FeSO 4and H 2O2
produced oxidations not mimicked by other methods known at the time.
2.In 1932 & 1934, Fritz Haber & Joseph Weiss proposed the existence of HO 
(hydroxyl radical) and HO 2―(superoxide anion) as the principal oxidants of
Fenton ’s reaction. Merz and Waters (1947) were among the first to propose that
HOradical oxidizes organic molecules by H abstraction.
3.In 1932, William Bray & H. M. Gorin proposed (Fe = O)+2(ferryl-oxo ion) as the
principal oxidant of the Fenton ’s reaction. Groves and coworkers proposed (in
anhydrous solvents) oxygen rebound phenomena, to explain abstraction of H-,followed by addition of HO- to the same carbon to create of alcohols fromalkanes in a single step. The debate raged for decades until umpired by D. T.Sawyer and coworkers.
4.Though 4e
/C0oxidations by Fe+3/H2O2were observed by Ruff in 1898, and
thereafter for nearly 100 years, Derek H. R. Barton & coworkers proposed the
19A History of the Fenton Reactions (Fenton Chemistry for Beginners)
DOI: http:/ /dx.doi.org/10. 5772/intechopen.9 9846structure of the oxidant as (Fe = O)+3(perferryl-oxo ion) in 1990, and the
bifurcated oxygen addition mechanism in 1992.
5.Donald T. Sawyer & coworkers investigated the behaviors of several transition
metal ions in aqueous and anhydrous systems. Sawyer and coworkers proved: 1)
H2O is not a spectator molecule; in the absence of water, Fe+2and Fe+3ions do
not produce HO radicals, thus explaining why Groves saw only 2e―oxidations
in anhydrous media, while Rush and others observed 1e―oxidations in aqueous
systems; 2) in aqueous system HO radicals can oxidize ferrous ions to ferric
ions; and 3) HO 2―radicals can reduce ferric ions to ferrous ions, thus in water
all three oxidants are present.
6.Though each oxidant has a singular profile seen in the oxidation of hydrocarbons,
different oxidative behaviors are seen with organic molecules containing oxygen.
Oxygen causes (Fe = O)+2and (Fe = O)+3ions to target hydrogens that are
bonded to hydroxyl carbons and hydroxyl oxygens. Abstraction of H from an
O-H bond in molecules with adjacent hydroxyl groups causes C-C cleavage ofdiols for all three oxidants.
7.Because of competition between the oxidants for targets, the order of addition of
reagents alters the outcome of the assay. Fenton ’s method was to begin with
substrate, add H
2O2, and then FeSO 4. In this sequence, when Fe+2(or Fe+3) ions
are activated by peroxide, ferryl-oxo (or perferryl-oxo) ions will react withadjacent H
2O molecules, producing HO radicals, that then diffuse to the
substrate, oxidizing H-X bonds by accessibility.
Addition of Fe+2(or Fe+3) ions first allows the metal ions to associate with
and/or chelate onto the substrate. Addition of H 2O2now creates the ferryl-oxo
(or perferryl-oxo) ions adjacent to the s ubstrate, increasing the likelihood
of in situ oxidation at the ion ’s binding site, creating uneven product profiles,
as observed in Ovalle et al. (2020). Allowing binding of metal ions tosubstrates before addition of H
2O2can explain observations of non-
canonical “crypto-hydroxyl- ”substrate oxidations previously observed by
many authors.
8.This summary is not an exhaustive history, nor is it the full collection of all the
articles I read. However, it took me many years to both acquire and understandthe chemistry of each oxidant. I did not address other metal/peroxide systems(such as copper-Fenton chemistry) here as it was not relevant to either Ovalleet al. (2001) nor (2020).
This article is written as a guide for newcomers so that they have a head start in
finding the papers they need for their research. Welcome to the club!
8. Conclusions
John H. J. H. Fenton did not know that his discovery would enthrall a legion of
researchers, be championed by two Noble laureates, and create three separate fields ofperoxide oxidation chemistry: hydroxyl radicals (HO ), ferryl-oxo ions (Fe = O)
+2and
perferryl-oxo ions (Fe = O)+3.
20Reactive Oxygen SpeciesFenton ’s successors required a full century to explain the ramification of these reac-
tants. These three simple molecules continue to generate novel research investigations in
chemistry, physics, and biology. I am proud to be among Fenton ’s successors.
