Abstract
We present a novel analysis of compositional order (CO) based on the occurrence of Frequent amino-acid Triplets (FTs) that
appear much more than random in protein sequences. The method captures all types of proteomic compositional orderincluding single amino-acid runs, tandem repeats, periodic structure of motifs and otherwise low complexity amino-acid
regions. We introduce new order measures, distinguishing between ‘regularity’, ‘periodicity’ and ‘vocabulary’, to quantify
these phenomena and to facilitate the identification of evolutionary effects. Detailed analysis of representative speciesacross the tree-of-life demonstrates that CO proteins exhibit numerous functional enrichments, including a wide repertoireof particular patterns of dependencies on regularity and periodicity. Comparison between human and mouse proteomes
further reveals the interplay of CO with evolutionary trends, such as faster substitution rate in mouse leading to decrease of
periodicity, while innovation along the human lineage leads to larger regularity. Large-scale analysis of 94 proteomes leadsto systematic ordering of all major taxonomic groups according to FT-vocabulary size. This is measured by the count ofDifferent Frequent Triplets (DFT) in proteomes. The latter provides a clear hierarchical delineation of vertebrates,
invertebrates, plants, fungi and prokaryotes, with thermophiles showing the lowest level of FT-vocabulary. Among
eukaryotes, this ordering correlates with phylogenetic proximity. Interestingly, in all kingdoms CO accumulation in theproteome has universal characteristics. We suggest that CO is a genomic-information correlate of both macroevolution andvarious protein functions. The results indicate a mechanism of genomic ‘innovation’ at the peptide level, involved in protein
elongation, shaped in a universal manner by mutational and selective forces.

Introduction
Most protein sequences appear to be quite random. Nonethe-
less, many sequences display various types of ordered patterns,observed in all kingdoms of life [1,2]. These include successive
expansion of a single amino-acid (known as ‘run’ or homo-
peptide), repetitive sections with various lengths and degree ofpurity, and more generally, low-complexity amino-acid regions,
i.e., sections of high compositional bias manifested by low single
amino-acid Shannon entropy [3]. We refer hereafter to thephenomena of ordered patterns in protein sequences as compo-sitional order (CO).
In the DNA, ordered patterns appear in both non-coding and
coding regions, including minisatellites and microsatellites, orgenerally tandem repeats of chains of few nucleotides. Their
generating mechanisms involve replication slippage and recombi-
nation effects [4]. These mechanisms, and others such assegmental duplications, may serve as the origin of the COstructures observed in proteins. Proteins containing CO exhibit a
wide variety of functions associated with disordered, as well as
ordered, 3D structures including extended coiled, helical domains,molten globules, collagen, keratin and zinc-fingers [5–8]. They areinvolved in DNA binding, alternative splicing, transcription,regulation, protein-protein interaction, tumor
genesis [5,8,9], and formation of novel functions, such as cell
envelopes of keratinocytes [10].
Tandem repeats are thought to represent a third type of
genomic variation along with single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) and copy number variation (CNV) [11]. This is becausethey are important not only for protein function but also for the
fast evolution of complex traits, including various phenotypic and
morphological changes as well as adaptive and social behaviors[12–14]. Variations of repeats in coding DNA sequences were
found particularly important in some rapid evolutionary processes,
such as changes in size and shape of limbs and craniums of dog
[15], and fast adaptation to changing environment of cell wall
proteins in yeast, which allows for avoiding capture by the hostimmune system [16]. In contrast, in human, variations in amino-
acid runs have been associated with disease, in particular various
cancers [17] and neurodegenerative diseases [18], where related
proteins are rich with poly-
Qrepeats [19], poly- Arepeats [20], or
multiple runs of various amino-acids as in the case of theHuntingtin protein.
The dual association of repeats with both essential functions and
disease promoted the view that repetitive sections are subjected to
rapid evolution by fast mutational drive, which facilitates the
PLOS Computational Biology | www.ploscompbiol.org 1 November 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 11 | e1003346acquisition of a function soon after a repetitive section came into
being [5,9]. The latter presumably did not fit any initial
functionality and may have even contained a risk of leading todeleterious effects. This raised the question of which evolutionaryforces act on repetitive sequences. Early studies [5,9,21] pointedout that interruptions of amino-acid runs are evidence of
mutational forces, and that mutations at the third DNA
synonymous site are indicative of selectivity of function. However,the role of selection remained elusive as other studies have shownthat repeats are only weakly conserved across species, indicating
weak selective pressure, except for some specific genes of the
xylanase family, the heat response protein Dnaj, and the ribosomal
L10,12proteins, which were identified as the origins of amino-
acid runs in prokaryotes [22]. Recently it was shown that
alternatively spliced exons are enriched in repeats with low
codon-diversity [23], and that repeat conservation in vertebrates isthree times higher in coding than in non-coding regions, but less inprimates [24]. Both observations constitute strong evidence for
selection. Evidently three fundamental evolutionary forces: muta-
tion, selection and ‘innovation’, i.e. generation of new rawrepetitive sequences exist; however, the balance between theseforces is hard to measure and may vary considerably among
species and conditions.
The interrelation between CO and evolution has been stressed
by Alba ` et al. [25], who have suggested that repeats may have an
important role in organism diversity and macroevolution, i.e., the
generation of higher taxa. This is because some developmental
genes, like Ubx in insects and HOX in human, are responsible formajor organism-specific characteristics and are rich in homo-peptides. Indeed, previous analyses of a large ensemble of species
revealed that the number of CO proteins is three times larger in
eukaryotes than in prokaryotes, independently of protein length[26]. Furthermore, some CO proteins were associated withspecific eukaryotic functions such as collagen, calcium binding
and keratin. Thus it was suggested that eukaryotes favor thegeneration of repeats as a source of variability to compensate for
their relatively slow evolutionary rate [26,27], indicating that themechanisms shaping CO are not universal in the super-kingdoms.
In the general framework of evolution, with particular emphasis
on eukaryotes, it should be noted that species development is often
described in terms of increasing organism complexity [28], which
is thought to be reflected by several factors such as the numbers ofdifferent tissues, cell types, proteins and their interactions [29].
Attempts to quantify this complexity from genomic sequence
suggest that natural selection is a necessary mechanism to explainthe seemingly increase in biological complexity [30]. Nevertheless,
the questions of which evolutionary forces participate in the
development of complex traits, what is the balance between them,how it depends on environmental and ecological factors, and
whether all this leaves any measurable genomic-information stamp
that correlates with the evolutionary path of species complexity,remained unresolved [31,32].
In this study we introduce the concept of Compositional Order
(CO), accounting for all types of repetitive and low complexityregions. The novel framework is based on the identification and
quantification of Frequent amino acid Triplets (FTs). The
biological importance of both amino acid and DNA triplets hasbeen pointed out in various studies, emphasizing their role in the
characterization of major bacterial phyla and super-kingdoms
[33,34], and the evolutionary importance of their spontaneousexpansions in higher taxa [35]. We show that triplets of amino
acids are adequate and even optimal building blocks for a
systematic characterization of CO. We define and exhibit threemeasures of CO in proteins: ‘regularity’, ‘periodicity’ and
‘vocabulary’. Regularity refers to the high multiplicity of amino-
acid triplets, and is defined by the relative coverage of a protein’ssequence by FTs. This measure is highly correlated with
Shannon’s entropy hence it recapitulates the conventional
establishment of low sequence-complexity regions. Periodicity
reflects the relative amount of FT occurrences within a periodic
structure observed on the protein sequence. In the case of tandemrepeats it may account for basic motif characterization. FT-
vocabulary is defined as the number of observed Different
Frequent Triplets (DFT) in either a single protein or in a fullproteome.
We demonstrate and evaluate the phenomenology of CO in
human proteins, quantifying them in detail using the newmeasures. We explore the functional enrichment of proteins
containing CO in several representative species, emphasizing their
dependencies on these new measures. We discuss the evolutionaryinterpretation of these dependencies. A comparative study of
human vsmouse proteomes provides new insights on the interplay
of CO with evolutionary forces. Last, we concentrate on a large-scale proteomic study, comparing 94 species from all kingdoms of
life. This leads to the observation that FT-vocabulary is an
important measure. At the proteome level DFT counts provideclear delineation of vertebrates, invertebrates, plants and fungi
from each other, with bacteria and archaea closing the list,
concluding that DFT is a universal proteomic marker ofmacroevolution. This throws new light on fundamental questions
in the evolution of species and on the nature of the genomic
mechanisms involved.
Results
We define Frequent Triplets (FT) to be those amino-acid triplets
that are observed in protein sequences far beyond random (see
Methods). Specifically, we search for triplets that occur at least 5times in a protein. Their statistical significance is discussed in TextAuthor Summary
Variations in compositionally ordered (CO) sections of
proteins, such as amino acid runs, tandem repeats and low
complexity regions, are often considered as a third type of
genomic variation along with SNP and CNV. At themicroevolutionary scale, they are involved in the rapidevolution of numerous biological functions and the
development of novel phenotypic complex traits, includ-
ing disease in human, in particular neurodegeneration andcancer. At the macroevolutionary scale, the best discrim-inating proteomic factor between super-kingdoms is the
prevalence of CO proteins in eukaryotes. The analysis of
CO structures has so far been quite eclectic. Here weintroduce a novel unifying methodology, accounting for all
types of low-complexity regions and repetitive phenom-
ena, including the existence of large periodic structures inprotein sequences. We define new CO measures providinginsights into the correlation of CO with protein function
and with evolution. In particular, a large-scale analysis of
94 proteomes shows that the CO vocabulary of frequentlyappearing amino acid triplets serves as a measure oftaxonomic ordering separating major clades from each
other. It unravels a missing genomic correlate of macro-
evolution and serves as a novel phylogenetic tool. Thissuggests that major CO generation occurs during thecreation of a completely new species, i.e. during macro-
evolutionary events.Proteomic Universal Correlate of Macroevolution
PLOS Computational Biology | www.ploscompbiol.org 2 November 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 11 | e1003346S1 (section 1–2, figures S1, S2, S3, S4, S5). In Methods, we
establish that the relative coverage (RC) of FTs in a protein
sequence highly correlates with sequence entropy, providing agood tool for estimating ‘regularity’ (Text S1 - section 4, figure S7).Additionally, the intervals between the consecutive occurrences ofan FT provide information about the existence of periodicstructures on the protein’s sequence. These are identified by themost frequent interval (MFI) encountered in a protein,
chosen out of all intervals displayed by FT recurrences on thesequence. The level of ‘periodicity’ in a protein is then estimatedby the relative periodicity (RP) : the sum of all FT recurrences
at MFI divided by the sum of all FTs occurrences. Thus we obtainthrough FTs independent information about both prevalentcomposition and prevalent periodicities. Few representativeexamples are shown in Table 1. Complete detailed informationis provided in Methods.
Compositional order (CO) of human proteins
We analyze the Swiss-Prot human proteome (N = 20248) in
detail, employing our new measures. The human proteome iscomposed of CO proteins (N
CO= 5511, 27.2%) and NO proteins
(NNO= 14747); the latter do not contain any FT. Identifying FT
occurrences on proteins allows for capturing a large repertoire oforder patterns of peptide repeats of different levels of purity. Twooutstanding examples of human proteins in Swiss-Prot records are:1) the pure glutamine run in ATX8, a protein which consists ofone
Mfollowed by 79 Q. Notably its DNA consists of an
uncorrupted chain of 79 CAG repeats [36]. 2) 40 exact repeats of
a peptide of length 20, VTSVPVTRPALGSTTPPAHD , on the protein
MUC1. The variability in the number and purity of these repeatsmay differ among individuals [37], and plays an important role incancer [38]. In Table 1 we present other types of order patterns
caught by the FT analysis. One finds single amino-acid short runs
of several amino-acid types, which may be distributed on variouslocations in a protein (Table 1 examples A–B), as well as repetitivemotifs of various length and purity (Table 1, examples C–F), asfound in many zinc-fingers (ZF), collagens and keratins. For highRP the repetitive motif is quite obvious (Table 1, examples C andF), while for moderate RP the underlying motif may be lessobvious and the MFI may indicate its origin (Table 1, D and E areexamples of motifs that seem to have undergone mutations). A fulllist of human CO proteins and their relevant CO measures, as wellas other sequence information, is provided in Table S1.
The distribution of MFIs (figure 1a) as well the distribution of all
intervals in the entire CO set (figure 1b), exhibit two leadingperiodic features in the proteome. One is that of MFI = 1 denotingprevalence of amino-acid runs, and the other is MFI = 28 which ischaracteristic of many ZF proteins. The interval distribution
further displays higher harmonics of 56 and 84 on ZF proteins,
which can be accounted for by mutation effects on amino acidsections with periodicity 28. Interestingly, the ranked-orderedinterval distribution (figure 1b) displays behavior close to that ofthe well-known Zipf Law, a hallmark of linguistic elements (seeDiscussion). A periodic structure can be defined by requiring aminimal number of interval recurrences at MFI (figure 1c). Inhuman, about 50% of CO proteins can be characterized asperiodic with at least 4 interval repetitions, on which we find onaverage 6 DFTs and 30 recurrences at MFI.
The number of ZF proteins is quite prominent in the CO set
(Table 2). It is of the order of 18%, doubling its relative weightcompared to the total human proteome. Similar doubling isobserved for collagen and keratin. The latter have substantialaverage values of RC, pointing to high relative coverage of FTs ontheir sequences, while ZF have high relative periodicity, RP. Incontrast to all these examples, proteins annotated as disease-
correlated, are not significantly enriched within the CO set. This
would seem to run against the common understanding that disease
related proteins have high compositional bias. The resolution is
explained in the next section.
Functional enrichment and annotation dependencies on
measures of compositional order on species chosen from
different kingdoms throughout the tree of life
Our principal measures of CO regularity, RC, and periodicity,
RP, can be used to sort out functions, cell-localizations and other
annotations that are enriched with CO (see Methods). We carry
out such analysis on three species: Human, A. Thaliana , and S.
Cerevisiae , which may be viewed as representatives of three major
taxonomic groups of eukaryotes: Animalia, Plantae and Fungi.
Their proteomes in the Swiss-Prot data-base contain 20248,
11304, and 5875 proteins respectively. In addition, we have
analyzed all the 187740 bacterial enzymes in Swiss-Prot.
Human. Analysis of human CO proteins using the GOrilla
GO (gene ontology) tool [39,40] shows, consistently with previous
studies, that human CO proteins exhibit numerous and highly
significant functional enrichments (Text S2). Notably, these
include regulation, transcription, binding, and various develop-
mental and metabolic biosynthetic processes (Hypergeometric P-
values,1028, FDR corrected). In figure 2, we further demon-
strate, using text search in GO annotations (see Methods), that COhuman proteins exhibit a repertoire of enrichment dependencies
on CO measures. Some functions depend on RC (figure 2A):
keratin ( P-value,10
212) and collagen ( P-value,10212). In this
category one finds also filament and cell adhesion related proteins.
Other functions depend on the RP (figure 2B), such as neuronal
(P-value,1026) and immune system related proteins ( P-val-
ue,1025) and other response proteins. Some depend on both
RC and RP (figure 2C), e.g., extracellular proteins ( P-val-
ue,10210for RC, and ,1026for RP). There also exist proteins
that have a non-monotonic behavior (figure 2D). In this last
category we note some outstanding terms that have been
previously discussed in the literature in the context of composi-
tional bias: DNA-binding, regulation and transcription. To better
understand the association of these annotations with CO measures
we further explore how they depend on MFI. We analyzed
separately two sub-groups of these proteins (figure 2D), those with
significant amino-acid runs (MFI = 1) and its complement
(MFI.1). The subgroup MFI .1 shows the highest enrichment
with RP, indicating that, repetitive sections other than runs play
important roles in the evolution of these functions. The subgroup
MFI = 1 further displays a clear monotonic behavior with respect
to the length of runs (figure 2E). The larger the coverage of amino-
acid runs, the larger is the portion of proteins associated with these
three annotations ( P-values,10212,1 027,1 0212for DNA
binding, regulation and transcription, respectively). Disease
proteins do not show any clear behavior with respect to RC or
RP, however, a monotonic enrichment was found with respect to
an increase in length of runs (figure 2F) with moderate P-
value,1024. Last, we note that there are several GO terms for
which one finds monotonic decrease of the portion of related
proteins for elevated thresholds of both RP and RC. These include
ATP, cell-cycle, signal transduction, proliferation and growth. All
these basic functions of living systems presumably evolve withoutrelying on CO-structures, implying strong accumulation of
mutations or purifying selection. We will point out below that
increasing CO is correlated with organism complexity; hence, the
fact that the most basic mechanisms do not require an increased
CO is consistent with our analysis.Proteomic Universal Correlate of Macroevolution

Typical examples of order patterns, as obtained by FT search in the human proteome. For each protein, Swiss-Prot entry name and main function is given i n the first
column, and then follow the protein length, the number of different frequent-triplets (DFT), the leading FTs, defined by the maximal number of occurr ences of a FT, and
the CO measures MFI, RC, RP. The leading FTs are highlighted within the protein sequence, displayed in the last column; in some cases they form runs of am ino-acids
(A–B), while in other cases they form large repetitive motifs of various purities (C–F). See Methods for more details.

of repetitions at MFI above the value indicated by the x-axis. Thus, for a minimum of 4 repeats at MFI (i.e., x=3 ), there are above 50% CO proteins

is with respect to RC (figure 3E). This looks similar to thedisappearance of RP-enrichment of extracellular proteins in A.
thaliana vs human. We will argue below that it is consistent to
assume that major CO generation occurs at macroevolutionarysteps. Since the macroevolutionary birth of the S. cerevisiae lineage
predates that of A. thaliana which clearly predates the several
macroevolutionary steps in the human lineage, it is consistent toassume that RP dependencies of the former species have washedout during the long periods of microevolution, due to accumulat-ing mutations.
Bacterial enzymes. Since the number of CO proteins in a
bacterial proteome is quite small, of the order of few tens,functional enrichment in a single bacterial species is usually notconclusive. Therefore, we analyzed the ensemble of all thereviewed bacterial enzymes in Swiss-Prot (n = 187740), whichcontains 6240 CO enzymes (3.3%). Enrichment levels displaydominance of cell wall and response proteins (figure S10 C),consistently with previous observations [43,44].
Furthermore, our methodology allows us to pick up extreme
examples of CO in bacterial enzymes, namely sections of proteinsequences having high RC, which further elucidate how COsections may accumulate throughout evolution. Two outstandingexamples are Lysostaphin enzymes in two different species thatbelong to the same genus, Staphylococcus simulans and S. staphyloly-
ticus. In both cases these enzymes contain a long repetitive section
of 15 x13 amino acid approximate tandem repeats of

uniquely associated with these two enzymes. Another example is
XYNA_RUMFL, belonging to Ruminococcus flavefacien . This
enzyme has a long midsection which is highly enriched withAsparagine (
N) and Glutamine ( Q), captured by the FT QNN, and
has no homolog elsewhere. As a last example we point to
SYE_TRIEI which has a standard Glutamyl-tRNA synthetasedomain on its first 480 amino-acids, followed by a highly repetitive
domain for the next 400 amino-acids (containing the FTs
ATD,
ATT, PVA, TAT, TPV, VAT ). This long chain has no homolog
anywhere in the known protein world. All these examples serve as
a show-case for CO sections of proteins that did not spread toother organisms; however they survived within these organisms,
presumably because they don’t have deleterious effects. As such
they allow us a glimpse into how very rich CO can emerge. Inanalogy with paleontological evidence, we may assume that manyother CO variations have been tried by nature, and have been
either discarded or reshaped into useful novel genes.
Comparative proteomic analysis of compositionally
ordered sets of Human and Mouse
In this section we perform comparative proteomic analysis of
human and mouse, based on Swiss-Prot data. The relationship
between the proteins of these two species is summarized in Table 3.The 20248 human proteins and the 16513 mouse proteins aresorted out according to whether they are CO or not (NO) and,
according to whether they are orthologs (V) of each other or not
(X) as indicated by Swiss-Prot annotations. Some of the 8 subsetshave interesting features that we describe below.
Analysis of the CO orthologous sets. Comparison of RC
values in mouse and human for the 3312 orthologous CO proteinsis shown in figure 4. Along the diagonal of figure 4 we find highsimilarity of sequences, FTs and their periodic properties. High
RC values are associated with some well-known protein families,
Zinc fingers (MFI = 28, 56), Collagen (MFI = 3, 6), Keratin(MFI = 5, 10). Because the lower harmonics are more prevalent,
the existence of the higher harmonics suggests the effect ofmutations, while the simultaneous conservation of function and
high CO in both species suggests that selection played a role in
maintaining them.
Pairs that deviate from the diagonal, and have high RC in one
species but relatively low RC in the other, have also low sequence
identity ( ,70%), as measured by Needleman–Wunsch (NW)
global alignment. These low sequence similarity proteins comprise11.5% (380/3312) of the studied set. Interestingly, we find thatprotein pairs in the upper off-diagonal (i.e., low RC in human and
high RC in mouse, including SPR1B, MUC4, ZN239, K1C9,
F186A, RPNT, SBSN, ZAN) display similarity between their FTsand MFIs in both species. For example, the protein K1C9 hasMFI = 8 in both species and similar prevalent FTs (
SGGandGSG).
In contrast, the lower off-diagonal pairs (high RC in human and
low RC in mouse, including CQ097, FILA, MUC2, MUC20,PGCA, PHGR1, SPRR3, INVO) have low similarity of the COsections , i.e. usually their FTs and MFIs are different. Two
exceptions are PRG4, with MFI = 8 in both species (FT =
PTT),
and TXND2 with MFI = 15 (FT = PKS).
Both types of observation are consistent with the fact that the
mouse lineage exhibits higher substitution rates [45,46]; hence
some CO structures that existed on the common ancestor maymore readily wash out in the mouse lineage if they are not neededfor functional purposes. Few examples provided in Text S1(section 7, figure S11) present evidence that the repetitive sections
are subjected to mutational forces that lead to an increase in the
intervals in mouse and to the creation of harmonics. In Text S1(section 7, figure S12) we have further quantified the discrepancyin mouse intervals distribution compared to their human orthologs
in all proteins that contain periodic structures (MFI .1), showing
that high harmonics are more prevalent in mouse by a factorlarger than 2.
Because orthologous proteins in human and mouse originate
from a common ancestor, it is of particular interest to study thesets in which the CO property has been lost or gained in one of thespecies (Table 4, sets H2 and M2). Their average RC is at bare
minimum, whereas their average RP is high, compared to the
Figure 3. Functional enrichment in A. Thaliana and S. cerevisiae .Similarly to figure 2, functional enrichment in A. Thaliana (A–C) and S.
cerevisiae (D–F) are shown with respect to RC (black) or RP (red). Portions of cell wall genes (A, D) and extracellular related genes (C, F) are enriched
with increasing the threshold of RC, while portions of response related genes (B, E) are enriched with RP in A. thaliana but RC in yeast.

PLOS Computational Biology | www.ploscompbiol.org 7 November 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 11 | e1003346orthologous CO sets. This may indicate that in these cases while
RC decreases (low FT coverage) functional evolutionaryconstraints retain periodicity which leads to the high RP.However, we did not find any significant functional enrichmentis these subgroups. Therefore, it is possible that high RP basedon only few FTs, reflecting low RC, may simply indicate thedegeneration of CO, a phenomenon that we have encounteredin the off-diagonal proteins in figure 4. Alternatively, the highRP and low RC in these sets may reflect the generation of newCO sections in the respective species with no evident functionalpurpose.Analysis of CO non-orthologous novel protein
sets. Another interesting case is that of CO sets which are
novel (Table 4, sets H3 and M3), i.e. have been created after thetwo lineages have separated from each other. The latter areparticularly abundant in human: whereas human has 1368 non-orthologous CO proteins (set H3), mouse has only 125 suchproteins (set M3). This discrepancy by an order of magnitude is
quite astounding, indicating that novel CO proteins have
accumulated to a larger extent on the human lineage since itsdeparture from the mouse lineage. Comparable novelty isobserved also for all non-orthologous proteins (both CO andTable 3. Human and Mouse proteomes analysis.

Figure 4. Comparison of CO orthologs in human and mouse. Comparison of CO orthologs in human and mouse according to their RC values.
Each point corresponds to a pair of such proteins (n = 3312). Low homologies are marked by circles. Usually, their CO sections are comparable,however revealing higher harmonics in the mouse (Text S1 - section 7, figure S11). Off-diagonal pairs always display low homologies. In the upper-lef t
diagonal CO sections of human and mouse resemble each other, having high similarity of FTs and MFI, despite the low RC in human. In the lower-right diagonal mouse CO sections do not resemble human CO sections, except for few exceptions (see text). High homology is obtained for protein
pairs with similar MFIs, such as zinc finger (MFI = 28), collagen (MFI = 3) and keratin (MFI = 5) proteins, and lie along the diagonal.

PLOS Computational Biology | www.ploscompbiol.org 8 November 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 11 | e1003346NO sets): 4992 in human vs 1187 in mouse. Sets H3 and M3 are
highly enriched in RP and RC values in comparison to the COorthologous sets (Table 4, sets H1, M1, respectively). Thus, CO ofthe novel proteins is higher than that of the older ones. A largefraction of the 1368 novel CO proteins in human are ZF,containing 433 out of a total of 977 ZF in the overall CO set ofhuman (n = 5511). When ranking the proteins by their RC values,a GOrilla analysis (Text S3) provides P-values,10
242for
functions carried by ZF proteins, and when ranked by RP theanalogous P-value reduces to 10
280. Other outstanding protein
families are keratin-associated proteins (61 novel, out of 94 in the
CO set) and protocadherins (44 novel, out of 55 in the CO set).
In view of the large disparity between the numbers in H3 and
M3 we have also extracted the number of non-orthologousproteins in human and mouse using various other databases andmethods, and re-assessed the ratio between human and mousenovel CO proteins (Text S1 – section 13 and Table S5). The ratioswe obtain are in the range of 2 to 5. Thus, although the
discrepancy is less pronounced than in the Swiss-Prot set, it is still
large and significant. Consistently, all sets show that significantlymany of the human novel CO proteins are Zinc Fingers.
Compositional Order vocabulary serves as a signature of
macroevolution
In order to study effects of CO for a wide range of species, we
have extracted from the NCBI-RefSeq data-base well annotated
proteomes, listed in Table 5, of 39 eukaryotes (including 7protista), 36 bacteria and 19 archaea, distributed across the tree-of-life [47]. In this table, we ordered the species according to thekingdoms Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Bacteria and Archaea. Theordering of the eukaryotes follows the tree-of-life, which is also areasonable ordering of organism complexity. We explore the FT-vocabulary, a measure of proteomic CO richness, which is definedby the total number of Different Frequent Triplets (DFT). This isthe count of FT types rather than the number of FT occurrenceson the proteome. Proteomic DFT counts displayed in Table 5 areinsensitive to redundancy, because two identical proteins in a
proteome contribute the same FTs.
One may discern in Table 5 a general trend of decrease in DFT
counts among eukaryotes with increasing evolutionary distancefrom human, excluding the 7 protista which are added at the end ofthe list of eukaryotes in arbitrary order because of uncertainties intheir phylogenies. Bacteria are ordered by the phylogenetic distancebetween phyla from firmicutes to protobacteria, with decreasingDFT counts within each phylum. Archaea are ordered by DFT
counts. DFT counts of prokaryotes are mostly in the hundreds, withfew exceptions in the thousands; the latter usually occur because of
few highly ordered long genes, unlike in eukaryotes (see Methods
sensitivity analysis, and Text S1 - section 2).
The data of Table 5 are grouped together into major taxonomic
divisions in figure 5. The latter exhibit characteristic ranges ofDFT counts that distinguish these divisions from one another,
allowing for a meaningful and significant hierarchical order
differentiating the successive kingdoms (Kolmogorov-Smirnov P-
values#10
22). The decrease of DFT may be also correlated with a
decrease in the complexity of the organism. This correlation is not
exact; however the trend is clear, yielding a decrease by factor of 5
from human to yeast. Protista are exceptional, with DFT counts
overlapping with those of plants and fungi. This is consistent withthe conventional view of protista as being a diverse grouping of
organisms that may not be closely related via evolution. Among
prokaryotes, we find an interesting systematic functional trend ofDFT counts: thermophiles exhibit much lower numbers (few tens)
than mesophiles, with differentiating P-value of 1.4 610
24. This is
in agreement with the analysis of Pe’er et al. [33] which found
bacterial thermophiles to be more closely related to archaea. It
seems quite natural to expect that the low DFT counts ofthermophiles are due to evolutionary pressure, since highly
repetitive amino-acid sequences may be less stable under extreme
temperatures. The few observed FTs may be important to inducefavorable structural changes [48].
No hierarchical order of the kind displayed here can be
achieved by measures such as the number of proteins, fraction of
CO proteins, average protein lengths (Text S1 - section 3, figure
S6) or other genomic characteristics [49]. It is interesting to notethe species that seem to possess extreme DFT counts within their
particular kingdoms. Fungi with the largest number of DFTs are
plant pathogens ( Nectria haematococca ,Botryotinia fuckeliana ). Bacteria
and archaea with very large DFT counts live in aquatic or cold
environments ( Chlorobium chlorochromatii ,Cenarchaeum symbiosum )o r
possess very complex functionalities ( Nostoc punctiforme ). This may
support the view that ecological and environmental conditions,
such as decrease in temperature, or inter-species hybridizations asin the case of amphidiploids in plants [50], had shaped DFT
distributions in these species. In Text S1 (section 6) we present a
reanalysis of the same data using a modified restrictive definition
of FTs which further abolishes any length-dependent contribution
(see Methods), resulting in figure S9. The same characteristics areobtained with slightly different P-values. We conclude that the
proteomic DFT counts lead to a unique correlate of evolution,
which is insensitive to the exact FT definition, providing adistinguishing hierarchical order-parameter.Table 4. Human and Mouse CO set – Enrichment by RC and RP.

PLOS Computational Biology | www.ploscompbiol.org 11 November 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 11 | e1003346This observation motivated us to analyze the identities of the
DFT contents of different proteomes. Defining DFT Ito be the set
of DFTs in proteome I, we look for the DFT-correlation between
different proteomes Iand J, defined by the Jaccard index:
CIJ= (DFT I>DFT J)/(DFT I<DFT J). The results are displayed in
figure 6, containing all eukaryotes, and figure 7, containing all
prokaryotes. In eukaryotes, the divisions between the sets displayed
in figure 5 are delineated also through the CIJ. Moreover,
mammals (id 1–5) stick out among the vertebrates (id 1–10),
having distinct DFT sets of their own. Invertebrates (id 11–16)
have the largest correlation to vertebrates; and plants (id 17–24)
show some correlation with animals, and less with fungi (id 25–32).
In contrast, some protista species (id 33–39) show an unexpected
correlation which gradually decreases from Animalia to Plantae toFungi. We note the particular case of Zebra-Fish (id 10), whose
DFT count supersedes that of human yet its correlation with
mammals is not too high. Hierarchical clustering, using Euclidian
average distance of C
IJ, shows that the hierarchical tree largely
overlaps the phylogentic tree. Animals, Plants and Fungi form
separated clusters with only little misplacement (figure 6, bottom).
Three Fungi that are plant pathogens, Nectria haematococca ,
Botryotinia and Aspergillus niger are grouped with Plants. Protista
species are distributed across the tree.
In prokaryotes, bacteria (id 1–36) are ordered in phyla, with
decreasing DFT counts within each phylum. Archaea (id 37–55)
are ordered by DFT counts. The correlation among different
bacterial phyla is relatively strong, except for bacterioidetes (id 15–
17) and chlamydiae (id 18–19), which have weak similarity toother species. The thermophiles Thermotogae (id 21–22) and
Aquificae (id 23) also have weak similarity to other species, butthey have strong similarity to the last 3 archaea which are
themophilic as well. The bacterium with outstanding DFT is
Chlorobium due to a particularly long protein, the parallel beta-helix
protein composed of 36800 amino acids. It has high correlationwith some cyano- and proto- bacteria. Archaea mesophiles show
significant correlation to other bacterial species. In contrast, some
Archaea thermophiles have either distinct DFTs of their own, orthey possess significant correlation with other thermophiles (eitherarchaea or bacteria).
Another evident difference between the kingdoms is the identity
of the most abundant FTs in the proteomes. They are presented inTable 6 for several selected species, highlighting those resulting inamino-acid runs. The latter are significantly more abundant in
eukaryotes than in prokaryotes (figure S13).
Last, we applied the same technique of DFT correlations
(defined at protein levels) to human proteins. The analysis shows
that it leads to classification of principal functional groups, notably
various metabolic processes of macromolecule biosynthesis,response to unfolded proteins and numerous developmental,morphological and anatomical structure proteins (Text S1 -section 8, figure S14). A compendium of human protein
information is presented in figure S15. There we sort all CO
proteins according to the clustergram (figure S14) and present thedistributions of DFT numbers in proteins, and protein numbers inwhich each FT occurs. We also zoom-in onto the 50 leading FTsexhibiting characteristics of co-occurrences.

DFT distribution functions in proteomes. The probability
distributions of DFT abundance in the proteome are shown in
figure 8 across 32 eukaryotes. They resemble power-laws for all
individual eukaryotes (Text S1 - section 9, figure S16). Few DFTshow up quite often on the proteome (examples are given inTable 6) and many DFT are quite rare, i.e. found on few proteins.Similarly, few proteins carry many DFT and many proteins carry
much smaller numbers of DFT. Many of the prokaryotes seem to
have similar DFT distribution behavior as well, but their varianceis much larger. The specific example of E. coli added onto figure 8
serves to demonstrate the large variance observed for a singlebacterium. Nevertheless, when individual distributions of manyprokaryotes are superimposed, they reveal a power-law behavioras well (Text S1 - section 9, figure S17), suggesting universal
characteristics. The general character of power-law distribution issimilar to evolutionary genome universals such as the membershipin paralogous gene families [1] and node-degree relations inbiological networks [51]. Figure 8 may therefore add a new law tothe ‘laws of genome evolution’ [52], this time at the peptide level.Further support for this view comes from observations ofspontaneous expansions of triplets in higher taxa [35].
Universality of CO measure characteristics. Studying the
behavior of CO measures we find that in single proteins RP andDFT show universal dependence on protein length L(figure 9). As
an example, we show in figure 9A that RP for human is negativelycorrelated with L, while figure 9C shows that DFT for human is
positively correlated with L. RC has no significant correlation with

L. The distributions (over L) peak around the centers of their
respective domains, and their averages may be well described bylinear regressions. Figure 9D displays the behavior of RP for allspecies, while figure 9G is its analog for DFT. The universalbehavior of these trends is quite obvious, as shown by the linearregression slopes for the average of these measures over allkingdoms in figures 9E and 9H, respectively.
Because FTs are not expected at random (see Methods), the
behavior displayed in figures 9C and G implies that growth ofprotein length and CO are linked. This suggests the possibility thatincorporation of CO may be an element of the mechanism ofprotein elongation. The decrease of RP, which is defined as the
fraction of all FTs that participate in the MFI, may occur in one of
two ways: either by increasing FT occurrences, as hinted by theincrease in DFT, or by a decrease in the number of FTsparticipating in the most prominent periodic structure. Assumingthat many of the longer proteins may be considered to be of older
evolutionary origin [53], the decrease in RP could be blamed onmutations that were accumulated during evolutionary history. Adirect analysis of the relationship between RP and protein ageshows that high RP is associated with relatively young protein age(Text S1 - section 12, figure S20).
Another feature of universality is provided by the rank-ordered
interval distribution functions. The latter is reminiscent of theZipf-law (Text S1 - section 9, figures S18, S19), a hallmark ofmany dynamic evolving systems [54], as well as languages whereword frequencies follow this law [55].
Discussion
Many efforts to order major taxa according to known genomic
measures are inconclusive [49; figure S6]. Aside from cleardifferences in the karyotypes, the best genomic discriminating

PLOS Computational Biology | www.ploscompbiol.org 14 November 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 11 | e1003346factor between eukaryotes and prokaryotes is the prevalence of
amino acid repeats in the former [26]. Their role in evolutionaryprocesses, in particular fast evolution of protein function anddevelopment of phenotypic complex traits is well accepted [11–16]. However, because of the large diversity of repetitive sections,it is difficult to find genomic variants and determinants that mayfurther elucidate their importance. Existing methods are usually
tuned to capture a few aspects of the nature of compositional
order, but a unifying framework has been missing [56].
Here, we presented such a unifying framework, by generalizing
the concept of compositional bias to that of compositional order(CO), which captures all scales of repetitive peptides, from runs to
repetitive domains. This is achieved by identifying multiple
occurrences of frequent triplets that are not expected at random.As such, their existence on protein sequences allows for detectingvarious patterns, and provides novel measures of order. We focusedin this study on three CO measures: ‘regularity’, the relativecoverage of FTs in proteins (RC), which correlates well withsequence entropy; ‘periodicity’ of FT recurrences (RP); and FT-vocabulary, the number of different FTs (DFT), representing therichness in the vocabulary of CO on a protein or within a proteome.
RC, RP and evolution
RC and RP provide novel perspectives on the evolution of
proteins and proteomes by putting various observations into acommon framework and applying comparative analyses. One of
the astounding facts is the CO enrichment of novel proteins in
human compared to mouse, leading to an increase in RC and RP.To a large extent, the latter is due to the large increase of ZFproteins in the human lineage.
Whereas an increase in RP is correlated with a general increase
of the CO component of the proteome, we observe that a decreaseof RP reflects the effect of mutations along the microevolution of a
lineage. Rapid evolution by high mutation rate will tend to erasethe periodic nature of repetitive sections in protein sequences.
Thus, when comparing CO orthologous proteins in human and
mouse, we find that some of the latter exhibit a clear decrease in
RP, which may be blamed on the higher substitution rate along
the mouse lineage. Our analysis of interval distributions is
consistent with faster evolutionary substitution rate on the mouse
lineage [45,46]. A similar conclusion that RP functional enrich-
ment of proteins deteriorates with evolutionary age of the
organism follows from the study of response and extracellular
proteins, for which RP-enrichment was seen to decrease from
human through A. thaliana toS. cerevisiae .
When a protein’s RP decreases along evolution this is evidence
that the particular period, rather than its harmonics, may be less
important to its function. Interesting cases are collagen and keratin
proteins in human and cell wall proteins in plants, fungi and
bacteria. In these cases prevalent intervals reflect the existence of
underlying repetitive motifs, but protein enrichment with respect
to RC and not RP indicates the tendency of these sections to
rapidly accumulate mutations for functional purposes. Thus RC,
rather than RP, correlates with these functions.
Universality of the CO measures
We note that the balance between the three forces of evolution,
mutation selection and innovation, acting on CO sections in
proteins is universal. This we conclude from three observations:
1) the power-law distribution of DFTs in proteomes (figure 8).
Interestingly, the accumulation of FTs in the proteome is
similar to evolutionary genome universals such as
the membership in paralogous gene families [1]. SuchTable 6. Predominant FTs in selected species.

PLOS Computational Biology | www.ploscompbiol.org 15 November 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 11 | e1003346power-law behavior is observed in node-degree relations in
biological networks [51], suggesting a particular role inprotein-protein interaction (PPI) and metabolism, networks
of similar functional node-degree architecture. Indeed, various
metabolic processes, notably of macromolecule synthesis, arefound in our human CO set. Other evidences for the role inPPI comes from the observation of CO enrichment in PPIhubs proteins [57], and the association of variations inrepetitive sections with the evolution of PPI network topology
[58].
2) the distribution of intervals resembling in character to Zipf’s
law (figure 1B). Zipf’s law, the rule of word frequency in text,is a hallmark of linguistic structure [55]. The intervalsbetween FT recurrences correlate with the lengths of larger
motifs (see, e.g. the ZF protein PRDM9 in table 1), thus their
frequency represents motifs frequency to a large extent. Theappearance of Zipf’s law also suggests fast evolution of motifs,such that there is no characteristic length scale of motifs, i.e.the distribution of FT intervals is scale free. In analogy ofconventional interpretation of Zipf’s law [59], our analysis
suggests fast evolution of immune system and response related
proteins in human, as well as cell-wall and response proteinsin plants, fungi and bacteria. This strengthens the view thatCO vocabulary is a hallmark of evolving diverse functional-ities, a consequence of the necessity of some proteins tointeract and adapt to fluctuating environmental conditions.
3) the relationships of RP and DFT with protein length (figure 9).
RP decreases while DFT increases with protein length, in allspecies. The ratio of the power-law exponents of RP and DFTis approximately constant, indicating a balance betweenrepetitive structure degeneration and CO vocabularyescalation. The positive correlation between RP and protein
age (figure S20) implies that insertion of raw repetitivematerial is a possible mechanism responsible to proteingrowth. This also further associates RP with relatively newfunctions.
DFT and macroevolution
The observation that DFT counts increase from archaea to
vertebrates, providing a clear delineating hierarchy of major cladesof organisms, is a unique case of correlating proteomic informationwith evolution. Since it relates to major taxonomic groupings, theevolutionary context to which it belongs is macroevolution [60].Macroevolutionary changes are invariably connected to majorgenomic changes. Novel taxa and novel functions are marked bygene and chromosome rearrangement [61], and gene duplications[62] which may occur even after speciation [63]. This is also whenmajor effects may occur in CO properties, as reflected by DFTcounts. Thus we posit that changes in DFT reflect macroevolu-tionary events. In other words, we envisage major CO accumu-lation to occur mostly during macroevolutionary events. Thefollowing microevolutionary forces of mutation and selection candiminish or modify the CO, leading to the presently observedstructures.
Eldredge & Gould [64] emphasized that long periods of small
evolutionary changes are intertwined by relatively short periods ofmajor changes, a phenomenon they called punctuated equilibri-um. The Cambrian explosion period is a striking example, wherechanges from unicellular to multicellular species occurred withinfew 10 MY after billions of years dominated by microevolution.More recently, large-scale analysis of various measurements

S1 - section 9). E. coli serves as an example of a typical prokaryote.

PLOS Computational Biology | www.ploscompbiol.org 16 November 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 11 | e1003346combining data from fossil records [65] showed that macroevo-
lutionary steps indeed occur in rare bursts at time scales .1MY,
presumably as a consequence of permanent changes in ecologicaland environmental properties [66]. Thus we should expect thatmajor changes of DFT counts have occurred at relatively shortperiods of time, while most of evolutionary history accounted forsmaller changes that accumulate during microevolution.
Gould [67] pointed out that one should not be influenced by
our parochial focus on human, believing that evolution proceedsin the direction of complexification, since speciation may just aswell take a turn toward simplification. Nevertheless, even ifmacroevolution can go both ways, it must still be true that highcomplexity of an extant organism, as well as a high DFT count, isa good indicator that its lineage has gone through many steps ofmacroevolution. CO structures that we observe on proteomes hadsurvived while being modified by mutation under selectionconstraints. This suggests that analogously to birth-death-innova-tion models of protein domains evolution [68], similar forces shapethe evolution of repeats at the peptide level.
In prokaryotes we find that DFT counts do not discriminate
between major phyla. We observe, however, a clear distinctionbetween mesophiles and thermophiles, suggesting that CO
generation and conservation is also condition dependent. Ther-mophiles have characteristically lower DFT counts. The ones thatwe observe presumably have been selected for functional purposes.Evidence for this is the crucial role of CO in the induction ofnecessary structural changes under extreme conditions [48], andthe prevalence of functional peptide motifs in extremophiles [69].
DFT content, rather than DFT counts, serves as another handle
on proteomic relationships. Boundaries of prokaryote phyla maybe discerned by their DFT content dissimilarity. This result is ofparticular interest when compared to previous attempts to findamino-acid sequence correlates of kingdom and super-kingdomdivisions. Using information about single, double and tripleamino-acid distributions, Pe’er et al. [33] observed some separa-
tions in a principal component analysis. Triplets turned out to bethe best distinguishing elements. In our analysis, also based ontriplets, but constraining them further to fit into FTs, we find thatDFT correlations are highly significant, exposing DFT contents tobe an important sequence correlate of kingdom identity.
Macroevolution is also affected by the landscape of inter-species
interaction as in the case of plants and insects [70]. Here, the role

PLOS Computational Biology | www.ploscompbiol.org 17 November 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 11 | e1003346of inter-species interaction is insinuated by DFT proximity of
species in one kingdom to species in a neighbor kingdom, asexhibited by the similarity of fungal plant-pathogens to plants.Such interaction was previously suggested based on analysis ofsimple sequence repeats contents [34]. Interestingly, many of the
CO proteins are response and immune related. Therefore, it is
possible that these proteins coevolved as part of the interactionbetween the species defense systems. Thus, the fundamentalfactors that shape evolution of different lineages, i.e. unequaldistribution of changes over time and correlation with ecological
and environmental properties, also seem to shape CO composition
at the kingdom level.
Lynch & Conery [71] studied the ordering of species based on
the effective population size xmutation rate, N
eu. While this
measure is based on comparisons within species, i.e. it is ofmicroevolutionary nature, their results suggest that increasinggenomic complexity, associated with transitions from prokaryotesto eukaryotes, is a consequence of magnified random genetic drift.Comparing N
eu with DFT counts over eukaryotes we find that
they anti-correlate (Pearson correlation = 20.6, P-value<1022,
Text S1 - section 11, table S4). This suggests that drift plays acentral role in shaping FT evolution. Furthermore, we have seenthat some CO in bacterial enzymes exhibit de novo creation whichhas presumably reached fixation through drift, without having any
clear functional advantage, although we cannot exclude the
possibility that these sections have emerged recently. However,there are various cases that are indicative of the effect of purifyingand positive selection. Purifying selection is indicated by the verysmall numbers of DFT in thermophiles, while evidence for positive
selection is provided by functional enrichment of various protein
families with respect to increased CO (i.e., RC or RP), and by themutations in synonymous and non-synonymous sites (Text S1 -section 10, table S3). To better quantify the relative contribution ofpositive and negative selection in specific protein families, one
should resort to studying the traditional dN/dS ratio.
In summary we claim therefore that the FT tools that we have
introduced and studied have proved themselves as meaningfulmeasures of biological investigation. Moreover, they turn out to be
very useful in providing the means for specifying which features
are correlated with different protein annotations, and how thelatter can be studied in a comparative genomics perspective. Webelieve that the highlight of this formalism is the fact thatproteomic DFT counts turn out to delineate correctly major
biological kingdoms, thus leading us to posit that CO vocabulary is
intimately linked with major evolutionary forces.
Methods
There exist known mathematical tools that come to mind for
studying compositional order. One is the Shannon entropy [3,5],
and the other is the Fourier transform. The first is low when aclear imbalance in multiplicity of different amino-acids occurs, andthe second should provide peaks for dominant periodicities. Butthe question remains what should be the basic variables. Entropy
misses out on the co-occurrence of amino-acids in repetitive k-
mers, while Fourier decomposition is much too noisy to allow foruseful analysis. The difficulty and the need in constructing newand more general characterization of repeat patterns have beenrecently emphasized in a survey of existing methods [56]. Here, we
establish a unifying framework for studying all types of
compositional order (CO) within protein sequences. The
basis for our systematic study is the identification of multipleoccurrences of amino-acid triplets that appear far beyond random,which we define as Frequent Triplets (FTs). FTs allow for definingCO observables that facilitate the quantification and identification
of structural elements of CO.
Definition and analysis of frequent triplets (FTs)
Triplets of amino-acids represent a set of 8000 elements. The
multiple appearance of a single triplet on a protein should havebeen a rare event had the sequence consisted of an independent
arrangement of amino-acids. The probability to observe any triplet
exactly ntime in a sequence of length L, is given by the Bernoulli
distribution: Pr(L,p;i~n)~
L
i/C0/C1
pi(1{p)L{i, where p= 1/8000 in
a uniform random model. The expected value, E, of the number of
different triplets that appear at least ntimes in a protein is
therefore:
E~8000 Pr( L,p;i§n) ð1Þ
thus, E/8000 is the P-value for FT misidentification. Numerical
search for the occurrences of every one of the possible 8000 triplets
on purely random protein sequences perfectly matches thistheoretical estimate (figure 10). For the vast majority of proteins
n=5 is sufficiently restrictive for eliminating any random
occurrences while maximizing the signal, the number of identifiedFTs. However, for very large proteins ( L.8000 )Ebecomes quite
large. Although the number of such long proteins is very small (3
in human, TITIN, MUC16 and SYNE1), a more restrictivedefinition that reduces E, can be formulated by requiring that
repetitions ( $n) of a triplet should occur within a section of
length Mon the protein’s sequence. The latter may become
useful for the analysis of long proteins.
In Text S1, we present both the uniform random model of
Eq. 1 and a unigram random model based on first order
statistics of all human proteins (section 1), and provide detailed
analysis of the human proteome comparing it to the two randommodels for various values of M(section 2). The analysis of
random models suggests that a regular assignment of a triplet as
FT, using n=5 yields P-values,10
23for proteins with L,8000
and is sufficient for any practical use. The fact that the regular
definition captures high-order structures in long proteins that are
otherwise missed by restrictive definitions provides furtherjustification for the use of regular FTs (Text S1 - section 2,
figure S5). Thus, we define Frequent Triplets (FT) of a protein
to be those amino-acid triplets that are observed to occur fivetimes or more, not necessarily as tandem repeats, on its
sequence. FT of a species proteome will be any FT that appears
in at least one protein of this species.
Setting a threshold nfor FT definition allows comparing CO
between different species. With n=5 a reasonable description of
CO can be obtained for all eukaryotes and prokaryotes.
Lowering the threshold one runs into the problem of random
effects, while raising the threshold is too restrictive (figure 10,inset) ending up with almost no FT assignments for some
prokaryotes. We find that 27% of the human proteins are CO,
i.e. contain FTs, while this fraction reduces to 17% in yeast andto 3% in E-coli . The fraction of CO proteins in the proteome is
shown in Text S1 (section 3, figure S6b) for the main taxonomic
groups we study. Similar orders of magnitude of orderedsequences are obtained by other methods [26]. Our methodol-
ogy has another important outcome for comparative analysis: it
tends to unify the mean compositionally ordered protein length
across the tree-of-life (Text S1 - section 3, figure S6 c,d). In
other words, CO proteins display higher length similaritybetween eukaryotes and prokaryotes than average lengths
defined over their complete proteomes.Proteomic Universal Correlate of Macroevolution
PLOS Computational Biology | www.ploscompbiol.org 18 November 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 11 | e1003346Measures of compositional order (CO)
Many protein sequences show significant periods or quasi-
periodic repeats. We wish to distinguish between the two aspects of
regularity andperiodicity . This is because both can be viewed
as orderly elements of a protein sequence, as in many tandem
repeats of any k-mer, but they are not necessarily correlated.
Regularity. Sequence regularity is traditionally estimated by
the single amino-acids entropy [3,5]. The Shannon entropy can be
generalized, using as its basis any k-mer of amino-acids, as follows
Sk~{XNk
i~1ni
Llog2(ni
L) ð2Þ
Where Nkis the number of possible k-mers in a sequence, Nk=2 0k;
Lis the length of the sequence and niis the number of occurrences
of the ithk-mer in the sequence. Skmeasures sequence regularity,
and is low when a clear imbalance in k-mer multiplicity occurs.
For comparative analysis, it is useful to normalize the entropy by it
maximal value, defining the normalized entropy, nSk. This
describes by how much a given sequence differs from a random
sequence of maximum entropy. For k=1,L&N1, the maximum of
S1islog2(20), and the normalized entropy is given by nS1=S 1/
log2(20). For k.2, usually Nk&Lthus the normalized entropy is
given by nSk=S k/log 2(L).
Considering all FTs that appear on a given protein sequence,
we define their ‘relative coverage’ RC of this particular protein
as the number of distinct amino-acid loci covered by FTs divided
by the protein length. This parameter correlates significantly withthe normalized entropy nS3(Text S1 - section 4): high RC implies
very distinctive CO, hence also very low nS3entropy. Thus, RC is
a good tool for estimating compositional bias. Note that the
dynamic range of RC is considerably larger than that of nS3(figure
S7 C), thus making RC an easier tool to use.
Periodicity. Many CO sequences show significant periodic
or quasi-periodic repeats (table 1). Entropy does not provideinformation about the periodicity of a sequence, neither does RC.
We introduce measures based on the intervals between all
consecutive occurrences of the same FT, I
FTi. Considering all
consecutive intervals of each FT, I={ I FTi}, one obtains the
discrete empirical probability distribution function of all consec-
utive intervals, P(I). We define the Most Frequent Interval
(MFI) of a CO protein as:
MFI~Imax ð3Þ
where Imaxis the interval at which P(I)is maximal. Because MFI is
based on the intervals of all FTs, and not on the intervals of the
most repetitive single FT, it is a robust estimator. Rarely, there are
two or more intervals with equal maximal probability, in whichcases MFI is taken as the lowest interval, because it is often also the
lower harmonic of the higher MFI. The significance of MFI may
be further evaluated by considering the number of intervaloccurrences at MFI (see figure 1c).
Based on the MFI we define the ‘relative periodicity’ RP as
the number of FT occurrences within the MFI divided by totalnumber of FT occurrences:

RP measures the relative richness of CO observed within the
periodic structure, compared to the overall CO observed in thesequence, and approaches zero as MFI becomes less significant.RP has no significant correlation with neither RC nor nS
k, and
therefore contains independent information (Text S1 - section 4and figure S7).
Vocabulary. We define a measure of FT-vocabulary as the
total number of Different Frequent Triplets ( DFT) . This is the
count of FT types rather than the number of FT occurrences, andcan be applied either to single proteins or to a full proteome. Thecorrelation between two DFT sets I,Jrepresenting either two
proteomes or two proteins is estimated by the Jaccard scoreC
IJ= (DFT I>DFT J)/(DFT I<DFT J), the size of the intersection
divided by the size of the union of the sample sets.
The case of overlapping triplets
Triplets may overlap. For example, in a protein containing the
sequence AAAAAAA there are 5 occurrences of the single FT AAA,
lagged by interval 1 and of total coverage of 7 amino-acids. Thisdefines an MFI = 1 case, here a run of
A. Similarly, MFI = 2 is a
property of tandem repeats such as AQAQAQAQAQAQ , composed of
two FTs ( AQA and QAQ) that occur 5 times each, separated by
interval 2 and with total coverage of 12. The occurrence ofoverlapping triplets is highly reduced in random models. Hence,one could have submitted runs to a constraint weaker than n=5 .
This has little effect on global analysis, hence we stick to a singledefinition using always n=5 as the minimal number of occurrence
of an FT. As a result proteins which have only short runs ( ,7) are
excluded from our set of CO proteins.
Relation to other repetitive phenomena and motifs
characterization
Several tools have been developed for analyzing tandem
repeats; both at the DNA level [72] and at the protein level[2,73]. While such methods may provide detailed local informa-tion on repeat properties, such as unit length, purity, andalignment-based repeat-variations, they are applicable to asubgroup of CO proteins with particular periodic structures.Moreover, such methods usually involve more than one stage offiltering and therefore require further choices of internal param-
eters to be able to account for each repetitive phenomenon such as
tandem repeats or cryptically simple repeats. Our CO measuresprovide global information and are not restricted to a specific typeof periodic structure. They span the spectrum of possible high-order structures, and therefore are not always directly comparableto other existing motif characterizations.
Nevertheless, within high RP proteins one finds cases of tandem
repeats, for which the CO measures can account for some basicmotif properties, such as unit length and purity. In a highly puremotif repeat pattern, for example PRDM9 (Table 1), the identifiedDFTs compose the motif of unit length 28. Thus, DFT = MFIindicates a highly pure motif. Even if part of the motif is variable,the identified FTs can appear in equally distant intervals leading tohigh RP, and MFI still indicates the unit length. Thus, RP isindependent of motif purity, which may be accounted for by thedifference between DFT and MFI. DFT ,MFI indicates a
decrease in purity. Note that DFT .MFI corresponds to larger
regularity than periodicity, as in some low-complexity regions, andwill usually indicate low RP but moderate or high RC.Functional enrichment
For large groups of proteins we employ the bioinformatics tool
provided by GOrilla [39,40]. In addition, to explore possible
dependencies on CO measures, enrichment levels were estimated
by text search of key-terms in GO annotations. Specifically, we
estimate Ntot, the total number of proteins with order measure
value.some threshold. For a given threshold, we obtain the
number of proteins that are associated with a certain GO term,
Nfun. The dependence of the ratio Nfun/Ntoton the threshold
provides an enrichment pattern which allows for quantifying
dependencies on CO measures also for small functional groups.
Enrichment P-values are estimated by the Hypergeometric test,
comparing the values of Nfunand Ntotobtained at the maximum of
the ratio Nfun/Ntotwith their values at the minimal threshold. To
avoid small number effects, Nfunis limited to 10% of the maximal
Nfun(i.e. at the minimal threshold), and in any case Nfun.15, such
that there exists sufficient data for statistical inference of
enrichment levels.
Data bases
Full proteomes of 94 species distributed across the tree-of-life
were downloaded from NCBI Ref-Seq, and served as the basis of
the large-scale analysis of compositional order enrichment. Swiss-
Prot reviewed proteomes of several representative species from
animalia (human, mouse), plantae (A. thaliana), fungi ( S. cerevisiae )
and bacteria (E. coli) were downloaded and analyzed as well. For
S. cerevisiae we compared in addition the Swiss-Prot proteome to
SGD data-base for validation of proteins annotation. Generally,
Swiss-Prot contains fewer proteins than NCBI. It provides
however high quality information about proteins’ biological
functions, and contains non-redundant sets. Therefore, we used
Swiss-Prot for detailed protein functional analysis, and also to test
the sensitivity of CO measures to the choice of data base (see the
following sensitivity analysis).
Sensitivity analysis
Interval distributions and the parameters specifying an
FT. We have opted for the use of amino-acid triplets, i.e. k-mers
with k=3. Moreover, we have defined an FT using a constant
threshold for its number of occurrences, n=5 . In Text S1 (section
5) we have tested other alternatives, i.e. different values of kand
different thresholds that depend on protein length. The results,
presented as rank-ordered interval distributions in figure S8, show
that the regular FT-definition is optimal for capturing large
repetitive motifs that are missed by alternative definitions of a
frequent k-mer.
Proteomic DFT enrichment in different
databases. Comparison of the Swiss-Prot human proteome
(20,248 proteins) with ref-seq data (34,084 proteins) by recon-
structing the list of Different Frequent Triplets (DFT), showed less
than 0.1% reduction in the number of DFTs in spite of the large
difference in numbers of listed proteins. This exemplifies the
redundancy of proteins in ref-seq data, and proves that the DFT
count is a stable measure. In mouse, where Swiss-Prot lists only
16,513 proteins, compared to 28,868 proteins in ref-seq, we found
a reduction of 10% in Swiss-Prot DFT counts. This seems to
indicate that the Swiss-Prot mouse proteome is incomplete.
Ref-Seq DFT counts of different species are provided in Table 5,
grouped into kingdoms. There exist outstanding DFT counts in
prokaryotes, such as for C. chlorochromatii , where few extremely long
genes are responsible for the FT assignment of more than half theDFT. Such exceptions occur in prokaryotes and account for the
outliers in figure 5. However, no such case exists in eukaryotes.
Even TITIN, which carries many FTs, is responsible for the FTProteomic Universal Correlate of Macroevolution
