Abstract  
In this research, decolorization of Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR) was investigated using a new isolated white rot fungus, 
strain KRUS -G, collected from Mulwarman University  Botanical Garden,  Samarinda,  East Kalimantan, Indonesia . The result s 
showed that strain KRUS -G decolorized RBBR efectively compared to P hanerochaete  crysosporium  and Ceriporiopsis  
subvermispora . T he highest decolorization was obtained at pH 4 with 89% loss of RBBR used. The effective decolorization was 
also observed in the high concentration of RBBR (1500 ppm).Concentration of RBBR at 500, 1000, and 1500 ppm caused 
slightly  decreasing  pattern on mycelia growth. Rapid decolorization was occurred within 4 days of incubation.  We suggest  that 
lac
case played an important role on the decolorization even  high activity of  MnP  was also detected .

1. Introduction  
A lot of synthetic dyes are used for many purpose s such as textile, pul p and pap er, food , and pharmacy. There are 
m
ore than 100.000 dyes produced in  the world. Approximately, 10 -15 % of synthetic dyes are directly release d to 
e
nvironment as effluent of industries , and 50 % are not confirmed exactly. Colo r removal of these dyes by chemical, 
phy
sical, and electrochemical method  demonstrate d some good results, but these  methods require high cost. 
Recent
ly, many researchers  utilize  microorganism s like fungi which have ability to decolor ize and degrade dyes1. 
White rot fungi are well known for their ability  to degrade lignin of wood.  This competence relates to their 
extracellular oxidative enzymes consisting of Manganese Peroxidase (MnP), Laccase , and Lignin Peroxidase (LiP). 
On
 the other hand, these enzymes are  also involved in colour removal of synthetic dyes2,3. 
Utilizing some species of white rot fungi such as Tr ametes sp, Pleu rotus  ostrearus , C oriolus  versicolor , 
Funaliatr ogii, Dico mitus  squalens , Is chnoderma  resinosum , Pleu rotus calyptratus, Bje rkandera  adusta , and also  
Phanerochaete  crysosporium  to degrade some synthetic dyes and textile -industries effluents have  been reported2,4, 9. 
However, only a few reports  have  discussed utilization of white rot fungi which grow in tropical rain forest of East 
Kali
mantan , Indonesia, related to their ability to decolorize synthetic dyes10. In this study, we investigate d the  
capability of  our new  isolated white rot fungus namely KRUS -G from our tropical rain forest  to decolorize 
R
emazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR) which  is one of the most important dye used in textile industries and also toxic 
and recalcitrant 5.Ligninolytic  enzymes and toxic effect of RBBR for mycelia growth were  also discussed.  
2. Materials and methods  
2.1.   Organism s 
Phanerochaete  chrysosporium  ATCC 34541 and Cerip oriopsis subvermispora  ATCC 90467 were obtained from 
B
iomass Conversion Laboratory of Research Institute fo r Sustainable Humanosphere, Kyoto University, Japan. New 
isolated white rot fungus (KRUS -G) was selected among screened fungi growing on  decayed woods in Mulawarman 
Uni
versity Botanical Garden, Samarinda, East Kalimantan, Indonesia. All of the fungi were maintained  on agar slant 
an
d petry dish containing potato dextrose agar (PDA)  and refreshed periodically.  
2.2. Reagent  
Remazol  Brillian Blue R (RBBR), Guaiacol, Potato Dextrose Ag ar (P DA), Polypepton, Glucose, Malt Extract, 
and Yeast  werepurchased from Wako Chemical Co. L td, Japan. All of chemical s used in this research were of 
anal
ytical grade.  
2.3. Screening of new isolated white rot fungus  
All of 24 fungi were inoculated into  petry dishes containing 20 mL PDA and 500 ppm guaiacol each petry dish. 
T
his method was modified from Afrida  et al (2 009)11.  Visual measurement was carried out to color change on PDA. 
The most effective fungus caused the highest color chan ge from white to brown PDA. All of 24 fungi were also 
inoculated into petry dishes containing 20 mL PDA and 500 ppm RBBR each petry dish. Visual measurement of 
RBBR decolorization has been done to determine selected fungus.  
2.4. Culture Media  
Fungi effect on decoloration . T hree mycelia plugs of KRUS -G were inoculated into 100 mL autoclaved 
erlen
meyer flask containing 20 mL liquid nutrient medium with  the following compositions: 20 mg/L malt extract, 
20 m
g/L glucose, 1 mg/L polypeptone, 100 ppm RBBR , and distilled water10. Both  P. Crysosporium  and C.  
Subvermispora  were also studied  in the samewayof  KRUS-G to evaluate their capability on decoloration of RBBR. 
In
 addition, erlenmeyer flasks containing nutrient , RBBR  but no  fungi werealso prepared  as a control. Then, the 
f
lasks were incubated in shaking incubator for 6 days at 28oC, 120 rpm. All of the treatment s were carried out in 
triplicate at  pH 4, 5 and 6.  
RBBR concentration effect on decolorization . Three mycelia plugs of KRUS -G  were inoculated into 100 mL 
autoclaved
 flask containing 20 mL GYP medium with comprised of  20 mg/L glucose, 5 g/L yeast extract, 5 g/L 
peptone, 1 g/L MgSO 4.7H 2O, distilled water2, and RBBR. Sodium tartarate was used to ad just the medium at pH 4. 
The flasks were incubated  in static incubator for 6 days and shaken periodically. All of  the treatment s were carried 47  Tito Sumandono et al.  /  Procedia Environmental Sciences   28  ( 2015 )  45 – 51 
out in triplicate  at temperature  of 28oC. Different concentration s of RBBR were 100, 500, 1000, 1500 ppm.  
2.5.  Toxic effect of RBBR on  fungal mycelia growth  
Toxic effect of RBBR was determined by the weighing of  dry mycelia of the new isolate d fungus. Dry mycelia 
we
ight (DMW) was  obtained by filtering the contents of flask. Then  a series of sample was also prepared in the 
absence of RBBR and used as the co ntrol. DMW from both conditions werecompared to evaluate the effect of 
RBBR on the growth of fungus.  
2.6. Decolorization Measurement  
All of free -mycelia liquid -media  were centrifuged at 2000 g  for 10 minutes (Hitachi CF15 RX II) to get 
s
upernatant. Decolorization was determined by measuring absorbance at 595 nm wavelength using UV -microplate 
reader spectro
photometer (T ecan Infinite M200, Wako).  
2.7. Lininolytic enzymes assay  
MnP  activity was assayed using  a reaction mixture containing 0.05 mL culture supernatant, 0.2 mM di -metoxy 
ph
enol (DMP), 25 mM Na -tartarate buffer (pH 4), 0.5 mM MnSO4, 0.1 H2O2 , and  0. 45 mL distilled water in total 
volume of  1 mL.  Laccase activity  was measured using a reaction mixture containing  0.05 mL culture supernatant, 
0.2 m
M DMP, 25 mM Na -tartarate buffer (pH 4), and 0.65 mL dis tilled  water in total volume of 1 mL.  
The reaction was monitored at 495 nm wavelength. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as amount of 
en
zyme that increased the absorbance at 495 nm by 1.0 pe r minute. The methods were modified from Kamitsuji  et 
al.12 
3. Results and discussion  
3.1. Screening of new white rot fungus  for  decolorization of RBBR  
We observed activities of 24 fungi spesies collected from Mulawarman University Botanical Garden on agar -
plate containing guaiacol. Fifteen species did  not give brown color agar -plate but nine  species showed positive effect 
(T
able 1). This fact indicates that the nine  ones have capability to oxidize guaiacol reflecting laccase  activity11. It 
also means that the fungi are  laccase positive strain.  
Furthermore, among 9  fungi oxidizing guaiacol, none of them  are able to decolorize RBBR but KRUS -G. This 
f
ungus was the only one fungus decolorizing PDA  consisting of RBBR (Table 1). Decolo rization has been observed  
since day 1 of inoculation till day 5 and  whole RBBR on agar -plate was decolorized to dark -brown color by the 
f
ungus at day 5 (Fig  1). This result showed that KRUS -G was the most  effective  fungus among  all collected  fungi.

3.2. Effective decolorization of RB BR by strain KRUS  G 
The experiment was carried out in liquid media  containing 100  ppm RBBR.  All of liquid media were  incubated 
in
 shaking incubator for 6 days.  Strain KRUS -G was compared to P. cr ysosporium  and C . subvermispora.  All of the 
f
ungi were cultured in liquid media  consisting of RBBR at pH 4,5 and 6 . 
The decolorization pattern of KRUS -G was similar to both C . subvermispora , and P.crysosporium. A ll of three 
fungi increased decolorization of RBBR for 6 days at different pH (Fig 2).  However, at the end of 6 days incubation 
period, K
RUS -G showed better activity than C . subvermispora  and P.crysosporium . Mo re than 79  percent of RBBR 
w
as decolorized by KRUS -G while C . subvermispora  and P. crysosporium  decolorized 63 -68 and 21 -23 percent, 
res
pectively. Furthermore, this fungus gave the best performance at pH 4  among all of tested pH  (Fig 2).    
On the other hand, it was  surprising that  decolorization of RBBR by P. cr ysosporium  was very low  and limited  
although  high decolorization capability of RBBR by P. Cryso sporium was reported  previously . Eiclerov á et al. 
reported  that whole of RBBR of 0.2 g L-1 on solid medium was decolorized by P. crys osporium8.The fungus also 
redu
ced more than 90 % of azo dyes of 0.15 g L-1 in liquid medium13. However, our finding was not in  agreement 
w
ith these results. We obtained that decolorization rate  of RBBR by P. cryso sporium  was very low  even lower than 
both KRUS -G and C .subvermispora. Furthermore, related to dye decolorization by C. subvermispora , we found no 
paper dis
cussing about it but one14. Accordingly, based on our knowledge, this is the second that reported dye -
decolorization ability of C . subvermispora.

Effective decolorization of high concentration  of RBBR by KRUS G  was showed in Fig  3. KRUS -G successfully 
decolorized
 RBBR at various concentration in liquid media. After 6 day s, 84% and 93.32%, of 100 and 500 ppm of  Strain KRUS G   Day 1   Day 2   Day 4   Day 5  a

initial RBBR  concentration were decolorized  respectively. Decolorization was also occ urred even at 1000 and 1500 
ppm
 of initial RBBR (Fig 3). It was surprising  that strain KRUS G could decolorize RBBR at high concentration 
w
hile other fungi only at low concentratio n4,5,7.  As shown at Fig 3, trends of decolorization at various concentration 
w
ere similar. Rapid decolorization s occurred from day 1 until day 4, but decolorization rate became slow after day 4.  
Laccase and MnP were produced by strain KRUS -G. Although MnP was detected in this experiment, we 
sug
gested that laccase played an important role on decolo rization of RBBR by KRUS G. First, as evidence, we 
found at from Bavendamm test that this fungus positively  produced laccase indicated by oxidation of guaiacol to 
brown -color appearing  on solid media (Fig 1a).  Second, in this  research, decolorization of RBBR occurred in liquid 
me
dia with the absence of Mn2+ whereas theoretically15 the ion is essential for MnP cycle. Thus, it indicated that 
M
nP was not involve d in the decolorization mechanism.

3.3. Fungal mycelia growth  
Toxic effect of RBBR was determined by comparing DMW of liquid media  containing RBBR to DMW of liquid 
m
edia containing no RBBR (blank). As shown on Fig 5, DMW of blank  or control sample  achieved 0.267 g/20 mL 
w
hile DMW of liquid  media was  not less than 220 g /20 mL . We found that the fungus could grow in liquid media  
containing 100 ppm RBBR as well as in liquid media  containing no RBBR (control). The slight decreasing  pattern of 
DMW
 onliquid  media  was appeared  ranging from 500 to 1500 ppm. It means that concentration of RBBR at 500 
ppm
 or more caused toxic effect to mycelia growth. This result is in line with Eiclerová  etal8who explained that 
in
creasing concentration of dyes caused slight decreasing Bjerkandera  adusta  growth.  
Related to dye toxicity to fungal growth, many au th ors have reported in several literatures. Erkurt  et al4 reported control  Day 1  Day 3  Day 4  Day 5  Day 6  Day 2  
50   Tito Sumandono et al.  /  Procedia Environmental Sciences   28  ( 2015 )  45 – 51 
that concentration of RBBR up to 100 ppm was not toxic to both Coriolusversi color and Funaliatrogii . However, at 
the same literature, unsimilar result occurred in Pleurotus ostreatus . Enhancement of RBBR caused reduction of 
DMW4. Associated with P. ostreatus, the fungus could only grow well in low concentration of RBBR5.

4. Conclusion 
Finally, we found that the new isolated white rot fungus  strain KRUS G could effectively decolorize RBBR 
compared to C. Subvermispora ATCC 90467 and P. Crysosporium ATCC 34541 even at the high concentration of 
RBBR. Concentration of RBBR at 500, 1000, and 1500 ppm caused slight decreasing pattern on mycelia growth. We 
suggest that laccase played an important role on the decolo rization even high activity of MnP was also detected.
