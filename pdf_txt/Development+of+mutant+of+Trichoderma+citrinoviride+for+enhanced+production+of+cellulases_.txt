Abstract Genome shuffling is an efficient approach for the
rapid engineering of microbial strains with desirable
industrial phenotypes. In this study, we used genome
shuffling in an attempt to improve the cellulase production
of the wild-type strain Trichoderma viride TL-124. The
initial mutant populations were generated by ultraviolet
(UV) irradiation, low-energy ion beam implantation and
atmospheric pressure non-equilibrium discharge plasma(APNEDP). The mutants were subjected to recursive
protoplast fusion. The cellulase activities of shuffled strains
were assayed after solid-state fermentation using wheatstraw, an economical raw material, as substrate. The
shuffled strain T. viride F161, which was selected from
among about 2,000 shuffled strains after two rounds of
genome shuffling, exhibited a total cellulase activity of
4.17 U g
-1dry weight, which was 1.97-fold higher that of
wild-type strain T. viride TL-124 (2.12 U g-1dry weight).
Analysis by random amplification of polymorphic DNArevealed genetic differences between the shuffled strains
and the wild-type strain.

Genome shuffling is an efficient approach for the rapid
improvement of microbial phenotypes (Zhang et al. 2002 ). It
involves multiple rounds of protoplast fusion to allow for
recombination of the geno mes of the starting mutant
populations (Zhang et al. 2010 ). However, the ability to
manipulate microbial strains is limited by a lack ofknowledge of their genomic sequence; thus, genome
shuffling offers a distinct advantage over recombinant
DNA techniques in that it allows recombination betweenuncharacterized organisms (Yu et al. 2008 ). In addition,
strains obtained by genome shuffling can be used in the foodindustry because they are not considered to be geneticallymodified organisms (Ahmed 2003). To date, genome
shuffling has been successfully used in a wide variety ofapplications: rapid enhancement of tylosin production inStreptomyces fradiae (Zhang et al. 2002 ); efficient degrada-
tion of pentachlorophenol (Patnaik et al. 2002 ); hydroxycitric
acid production in Streptomyces sp. (Hida et al. 2007 ); acid
tolerance in Lactobacillus (Wang et al. 2007 );
L-lactic acid
production and glucose tolerance in Lactobacillus rhamnosus
(Yu et al. 2008 ); thermo-tolerance and ethanol-tolerance;
ethanol productivity in industrial yeast (Shi et al. 2009 );
cellulase production in Penicillium decumbens JU-A10
(Cheng et al. 2009 ); vitamin B12 production by Propioni-
bacterium shermanii (Zhang et al. 2010 ); improved tolerance
ofPichia stipitis towards hardwood spent sulfite liquor
(Bajwa et al. 2010 ); production of pullulan in Aureobasidium
pullulans (Kang et al. 2011).
Cellulose, a β-1,4-linked glucose polymer, is considered
to be the primary product of photosynthesis and the most
abundant renewable carbon source in nature (Jarvis 2003 ).

DOI 10.1007/s13213-011-0284-8sugars or fuel ethanol by fungal enzyme systems has
attracted serious attention from researchers in response to
the oil crisis (Szengyel et al. 2000 ). However, the high cost
of cellulase is still the major limiting factor in the
hydrolysis of cellulosic materials to fermentable sugars. It
is therefore imperative to improve cellulase production tomake the process more economically viable (Adsul et al.
2007 ). To date, many traditional mutagenic strategies have
been applied to improve cellulase production (Cherry and
Fidantsef 2003 ; Adsul et al. 2007 ; Ahamed and Vermette
2008 ; Chandra et al. 2009 ; Li et al. 2010 ), but despite
significant efforts, few co mmercially efficient enzyme
complexes have been produced to date. Consequently, the
high cost of the enzyme is still the bottleneck in the
production of fermentable sugars from cellulosic materials(Adsul et al. 2007 ).
Novel strains capable of improved cellulase production
therefore need to be developed. The aim of the study reportedhere was to produce a mutant strain of Trichoderma viride
with enhanced cellulase production by using genomeshuffling. We also analyzed the genomes of the shuffledstrains by random amplification of polymorphic DNA
(RAPD).
Materials and methods
Microorganisms and culture material
The wild-type strain T. viride TL-124 was isolated from
stacks of wheat straw and maintained on potato dextrose agar
(PDA) (Adsul et al. 2007 ) in test tubes at 28°C. Minimal
medium (Tao et al. 2008 ) was used to cultivate T. viride .
Cellulose –Congo red medium was used [(in g l
-1)K H 2PO4,
0.5; MgSO 4·7H 2O, 0.25; Congo red, 0.2; cellulose, 1.88
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO); agar, 20; pH 7.0] for the preliminary
selection of mutants.
The wheat straw used to prepare the medium for
solid-state fermentation was treated according to themethod of Gao et al. ( 2008 ). Solid-state fermentation
medium was prepared in a 250-ml Erlenmeyer flask
containing 10 g of wheat straw, 0.25 g of (NH
4)2SO4
and 25 ml of distilled water. The medium was autoclavedfor 30 min at 121°C.
Mutagenesis
The mutant populations used as the starting strains for
genome shuffling were obtained through subtle improve-
ments of the wild-type T. viride strain TL-124 by ultraviolet
(UV) irradiation, low-energy ion beam implantation and
atmospheric pressure non-equilibrium discharge plasma
(APNEDP) as described below.For UV irradiation, protoplasts of T. viride TL-124 were
prepared as described by Penttila et al. ( 1987 ). The protoplast
suspension (2 ml of a 10
6protoplast ml-1suspension) was
exposed to UV irradiation according to the method of
Rubinder et al. ( 2002 ).D-Sorbitol (1 mol l-1) was used as
the osmotic stabilizer. Before sporulation, the growing
colonies were transferred to PDA slants for further study.
Low-energy ion implantation was performed on UV-
mutated T. viride according to the method of Su et al.
(2006 ) on the heavy ion implantation facility (patent no.
ZL93103361.6, People’ s Republic of China) of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences, Institute of Plasma Physics (ASIPP).Nitrogen ions with an energy of 15 keV were used with an
implantation dose of 90×2.6×10
4icons s-1cm-2.
For APNEDP mutagenesis, the spores of T. viride mutated
by low-energy ion implantation were placed 2.0 mmdownstream of a plasma torch nozzle exit and treated with
pure helium plasma at Pin=180 W and Q
He=15.0 slpm. The
corresponding gas temperature of the plasma jet was <40°C
(Wang et al. 2010 ).
Genome shuffling
A conidial suspension of T. viride TL-124 was prepared by
the addition of 5 ml of a 9 g l-1sterile NaCl solution to 7-
day-old PDA slant cultures. About 100 μl of the suspension
was spread onto a PDA plate and incubated at 28°C. After
an incubation of about 18 h, mycelia of the mutated strain
were harvested and washed with 0.1 mol l-1phosphate
buffer (pH 5.6). Protoplasts were prepared according to the
method of Penttila et al. ( 1987 ).
Equal numbers of protoplasts from different populations
were first mixed and the mixture then divided equally intotwo parts. One part was inactivated under UV light for
10 min, and the other was heat-treated at 60°C for 5 min(Hopwood and Wright 1979 ). The two inactivated proto-
plast samples were mixed at a ratio of 1:1, collected bycentrifugation and resuspended in 50 μl of STC buffer
(1 mol l
-1D-sorbitol, 10 mmol l-1Tris-HCl, 10 mmol l-1
CaCl 2, pH 7.5). Nine volumes of 60% PEG 6000 in STC
buffer were added to the resuspended protoplast mixture,which was then incubated for 6 min at room temperature.
STC buffer was added to produce a final total volume of 5 ml,
and the fused protoplasts were collected by centrifugation,washed with STC buffer and resuspended in 100 μlo fS T C
buffer. Serial dilutions were regenerated on HMM plates(MM medium with 1 mol l
-1D-sorbitol as an osmotic
stabilizer) and incubated for 5 –8 days at 28°C. The colonies
growing on HMM medium were subcultured on PDA toproduce a shuffled pool.
Promising shuffled strains identified after one round of
genome shuffling served as the starting strains for the nextround of genome shuffling.510 Ann Microbiol (2012) 62:509 –515Fermentation
For the first round of selection, all shuffled strains were
screened on cellulose –Congo red screening medium. The
most promising strains were selected based on the diameterof the clear zone surrounding each colony. For the secondround of selection, the strains selected during the first round
were subjected to solid-state fermentation using the
economical raw material wheat straw as a carbon sourceand 0.5% (NH
4)2SO4as a nitrogen source. In this medium,
wheat straw was used as the inducer for cellulase.
Enzyme assay
The crude enzyme preparation was prepared according to the
method of Latifian et al. ( 2007 ) and the protein concentration
determined by the Bradford method (Bradford 1976 )u s i n g
bovine serum albumin fraction V (Sigma) as the standard.Filter paper activity (FPA, representing total cellulase),
CMCase (endoglucanase), β-glucosidase and cellobiohydro-
lase (exoglucanase) activities were determined according to
the methods of Ghose ( 1987 ) with modifications. The
released sugar was measured by the dinitrosalicylic acidmethod (Miller 1959 ).
Random amplification polymorphic DNA analysis
DNA was extracted from mycelia of T. viride cultured for 2
days in liquid medium. The mycelia were filtered through
Whatman no. 1 filter paper (Whatman, New York, NY) and
washed three times with distilled water. Genomic DNA
extraction and random amplified polymorphic DNA(RAPD) analysis were performed as described by Wang
et al. ( 2011 ) and Chandra et al. ( 2009 ), respectively. For the
RAPD analysis, the primers shown in Table 1were used.
Amplification was achieved using a thermal cycler(PTC200; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) set at the following
program: 95°C for 5 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95°Cfor 30 s, 36°C for 1 min and 72°C for 2 min. The products
were separated by electrophoresis in 2.0% agarose gels.
Results
Selection of the starting strains for genome shuffling
In this study, wild-type T. viride TL-124 was mutated
successively by UV irradiation, low-energy ion beam
implantation and APNEDP as described in the Materials
and Methods . Mutant selection was based initially on the
diameter of the clear zones surrounding the colonies grownon cellulose –Congo red medium (Zaldivar et al. 2001 ).
After each mutagenic treatment, the cellulase activities of a
mass of clones that displayed promising relatively larger
clear zones were assessed by solid-state fermentation using
wheat straw as the inducer. The most promising strainsbased on the results of the cellulase activity assay were
subjected to a subsequent mutagenic treatment. After three
mutagenic steps, more than 1,000 mutant colonies wereproduced, four of which (C4, C10, C31, and C36) were
selected as the starting strains for genome shuffling.
Enhancement of cellulase productions by genome shuffling
Genome shuffling was applied to improve cellulase
production by the T. viride mutants C4, C10, C21, and
C36 produced by APNED. After one round of genome
shuffling, four shuffled strains (E5, E16, E35, and E68)
were selected based on their total cellulase activity (3.23,
3.01, 2.87, 3.14 U g
-1dry weight, respectively; Fig. 1a).
These strains were then used as the starting strains for a
second round of genome shuffling, which resulted in two
shuffled strains (F62 and F161), with a total cellulaseactivity of 4.05 and 4.17 U g
-1dry weight, respectively
(Fig. 1a). Shuffled strain T. viride F161 exhibited the
highest total cellulase activity among the shuffled strains

activity that was 1.46-fold that in the starting strain T. viride
C21 (2.85 U g-1dry weight), which in turn had the highest
activity among the strains obtained after mutagenesis, and1.97-fold that in the wild-type strain T. viride TL-124
(2.12 U g
-1dry weight). There was no obvious difference in
the protein concentration between the shuffled strains andthe wild-type strain (Fig. 1b), indicating that the enhanced
cellulase production was not caused by increased extracel-
lular protein secretion.
Cellulase production profiles of the shuffled strains
The time course of cellulase production of the shuffled
strains was analyzed using T. viride TL-124 as control.
The results showed that the wild-type strain and theshuffled strains showed the same trend in the 7-day solid-
state fermentation period, except for the level of cellulase
production (Fig. 2a) and protein concentration (Fig. 2b).
Total cellulase activity and pro tein concentration in both
strains increased continuously during fermentation, reach-ing a maximum at 4 days and then decreasing withincreasing fermentation tim e. This decrease may have
been caused by the autolysis of the mycelia (Fang et al.2009 ).CMCase, cellobiohydrolase and β-glucosidase of the
shuffled strains T. viride F62 and F161 were assayed
together with the wild-type strain after 4 days of solid-statefermentation using wheat straw as substrate. The resultsshowed that F62 and F161 also exhibited higher CMCase
(1.70-, 1.68-fold), cellobiohydrolase (2.17-, 2.43-fold) and
β-glucosidase (1.35-, 1.53-fold) levels than the wild-type
strain T. viride TL-124 (Table 2). In a previous assay
carried out in our laboratory on the cellulase activity ofT. viride TL-124 and Trichoderma reesei QM9414, which
is currently the most commonly used cellulase-producing
strain in industrial processess, under solid-state fermenta-
tion conditions (Xu et al. 2011 ), the total cellulase activity
of the wild-type strain T. viride TL-124 was about 1.24-fold
higher than that of T. reesei QM9414. These results

To confirm genome shuffling, an RAPD polymorphism
analysis was carried out using the wild-type T. viride TL-124
and the shuffled strains T. viride F62 and F161. The DNA
banding patterns were similar between the parent and mutantstrains except with primer P01 (sequence GTCCTACTCG).Based on the RAPD profiles, shuffled strains T. viride F62
and F161 were closer to the parental strain T. viride TL-124
(Fig. 3). The results also revealed the presence of two unique
bands in shuffled strain T. viride F161 that were not present
in wild-type T. viride TL-124 (Fig. 3). Similarly, one unique
band was observed in wild-type T. viride TL-124 that was
not present in T. viride F62. Moreover, shuffled strains T.
viride F161 and F62 showed different polymorphic bands, as
the mechanism of mutation differed between them. Usingprimer PO1, Chandra et al. ( 2009 ) also reported unique DNA
banding patterns in parent and mutant strains T. citrinoviride
EB-104, T. citrinoviride EM-563 and T. citrinoviride EB-
782, possibly indicating that this primer might be adaptive
for the differentiation from the mutant cellulase-producing
strain. The specific bands obtained in our study show thatgenetic information was transferred from the parental strains
to the shuffled strains by genome shuffling and that the
genetic information of the shuffled strains had been changed.
Discussion
The bioconversion of cellulosic materials to fermentable
sugars or fuel ethanol by fungal enzyme systems hasattracted serious attention from researchers in response to
the oil crisis (Szengyel et al. 2000 ). This has led to
cellulolytic fungi, especially T. reesei and T. viride , being
extensively studied for their abilities to produce extracellu-
lar cellulases (Zhang et al. 2006 ). However, the existing
Trichoderma cellulase systems have several disadvantages,
including low enzymatic yields, low specific activities, end-product inhibition and deficient β-glucosidase production
(Adsul et al. 2007 ). Thus, attempts to use these cellulase
systems for the degradation of cellulosic materials have notbeen successful (Zaldivar et al. 2001 ).To date, many traditional mutagenesis strategies, such as
nitrosoguanidine mutagenesis and UV-irradiation, have
been applied to improve the production of cellulase (Cherry
and Fidantsef 2003 ; Ahamed and Vermette 2008 ). Despite
these concerted efforts, however, the high cost of the
enzyme is still the bottleneck in the utilization of the raw
cellulosic materials (Adsul et al. 2007 ). It has therefore
became imperative to attempt to develop some novel strain
with improved cellulase production.
Zhang et al. ( 2002 ) reported that genome shuffling was
an approach that could be used to enhance the metaboliteyield and improve the phenotype of the target strain within

successfully applied to improve the cellulase-producing
strain T. viride TL-124. Total cellulase activity of T. viride
F161, which showed the highest total cellulase activity of
all shuffled strains, was about twofold higher than that of
the wild-type strain T. viride TL-124. This could be further
improved by optimization of the cultural conditions or by
genetic engineering approaches. Moreover, our comparison
of RAPD polymorphism between the parents and shuffledstrains revealed that the genotype of the parents and
shuffled strains was different, indicating that the genetic
information had been transferred from the parental strainsto shuffled strains by genome shuffling and that the genetic
information of the shuffled strains had been changed. All of
the results obtained in our this study clearly demonstratethat the whole genome can be efficiently improved by
genome shuffling for the enhancement of the cellulase
activities in T. viride .
To facilitate the screening and identification of shuffled
strains during genome shuffling procedures, the parentstrains usually have selective markers. However, anygenetic marker that could serve as a powerful selective
marker, such as auxotroph protoplasts, would affect the
physiology and metabolism of the strains and decrease the
cellulase activities of the shuffled strains. Protoplast
inactivation is one method that may not affect the activitiesof cellulase in the offspring. Therefore, we used protoplast
inactivation as the selective marker in our study.
Cellulase is a complex enzyme comprised of three
components, namely, endo-1, 4- β-glucanase, 1, 4- β-
D-
cellobiohydrolase and 1, 4- β-glucosidase. The degrading
of cellulose to glucose is the synergistically action of these
three components. Total cellulase activity, also called filter
paper activity, represents the interaction between these three
enzymes with the cellulose. Therefore, in this study, totalcellulase activity was assayed to determine the ability of the
shuffled stains ’cellulose to degrade glucose. Martins et al.
(2008 ) revealed that differences in the protein concentration
do not allow a direct comparison of the volumetricactivities, and that there was a better correspondence when
activity values were compared on the basis of proteinconcentration. Thus, the estimation of protein concentration
is vital to the cellulase activity assay. In our study, the
Bradford method (Bradford 1976 ) was adopted.
Solid-state fermentation is an attractive process for
economically producing cellulase because of is associatedwith low capital costs in terms of equipment and lowoperational costs (Xia and Cen 1999 ). Nevertheless, the
selection of an inexpensive and readily available substrateis essential to lower the cost and optimize the yield ofcellulase production (Beg et al. 2000 ). We therefore
investigated the cellulase activities of the shuffled strain T.
viride F161using solid-state fermentation. Compared withthe wild-type strain T. viride TL-124, the shuffled strain T.
viride L161 produced a higher level of cellulase under
solid-state fermentation conditions using the economicalraw material wheat straw as substrate.
