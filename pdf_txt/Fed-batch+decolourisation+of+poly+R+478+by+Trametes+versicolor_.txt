In order to identify white rot fungi with high pote ntial in biological pretreatment of lignocellulosic  biomass, 18 
preliminary screening was carried out on plates by testing strains’ abilities to oxidize guaiacol and decolorize the 19 
dyes, azure B and Poly R4478. Of the eighty six str ains screened, sixteen were further used for second ary screening 20 
based on their ligninolytic ability. However, low m anganese peroxidase activity and no lignin peroxida se activity 21 
were detected. Strain BBEL0970 was proved to be the  most efficient in laccase production, which was fi nally 22 
identified as T. versicolor  by the analysis of ribosomal DNA internal transcri bed spacer gene sequence. Combining 23 
laccase production with biological pretreatment, th e replacement of glucose with barley straw signific antly improved 24 
the laccase activity up to 10.3 U/ml, which provide d evidence toward potential utilization of barley s traw in laccase 25 
production by BBEL0970. Simultaneously, comparison in thermogravimetry analysis of the untreated and p retreated 26 
barley straw in liquid fermentation of laccase also  demonstrated the high potential of BBEL0970 in bio logical 27 
pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass. This work sheds light on further exploration on integrated pr ocess of low4 28 
cost laccase production and efficient biological pr etreatment of barley straw by T. versicolor  BBEL0970. 29

Introduction 32 
Concerns over fossil fuel supply and environmental issues have resulted in a large interest in researc hes relevant to 33 
renewable biofuel production from different lignoce llulosic biomass, such as agricultural residues, fo rest products, 34 
and dedicated crops. Cellulose, hemicellulose and l ignin are the main components present in the cell w all of 35 
lignocellulosic materials and the conversion of cel lulose and hemicellulose to monomers is blocked by many 36 
physicochemical, compositional and structural facto rs. Various pretreatments, including chemical, biol ogical, 37 
physical, and combinations thereof, are employed to  deconstruct the plant cell wall and increase the a ccessibility of 38 
enzymes to cellulose. Biological pretreatment is co nsidered as promising desirable pretreatment techno logies owing 39 
to its environmental friendliness and lower energy consumption (Ruqayyah et al. 2013; Song et al. 2013 ; Wang et al. 40 
2013).  41 
White rot fungi, well4known lignocellulosic decompo sers in ecological processes, play a key role in th e 42 
decomposition of woody debris and have attracted pa rticular attention due to their great capability fo r delignification. 43 
The principal mechanisms responsible for lignin deg radation by white rot fungi involve ligninolytic en zymes, mainly 44 Page 2 of 23
https://mc06.manuscriptcentral.com/cjm-pubsCanadian Journal of MicrobiologyDraftincluding laccase, manganese peroxidase (MnP), and lignin peroxidase (LiP) (Ferhan et al. 2013). Ligni nolytic 45 
enzymes are produced during secondary metabolism. F requently, more than one isoform of ligninolytic en zymes is 46 
expressed under different culture conditions (Dhoui b et al. 2005). A variety of research indicates tha t the production 47 
of ligninolytic enzymes is species4 and strain4depe ndent (Elisashvili and Kachlishvilia 2009), therefo re the discovery 48 
and selection of new organisms with higher delignif ication efficiency are both possible and necessary.  During recent 49 
years, several studies have focused on exploring ne w or potentially powerful white rot fungi from vari ous natural 50 
habitats (Dhouib et al. 2005). We selected the Olym pic National Park in Washington State as the sampli ng site for 51 
the collection of ligninolytic fungi, which might b e of high potential in biological pretreatment of l ignocellulosic 52 
materials. Studies on fungal diversity in Washingto n State are attracting more and more interest (Edmo nds and Lebo 53 
1998; Hoff et al. 2004), and basidiomycetes diversi ty has also been reported in the Olympic National P ark (Edmonds 54 
and Lebo 1998), which boasts mild temperatures, hig h amounts of precipitation, and outstanding biodive rsity (Van 55 
Pelt et al. 2006). However, there is no report on t he isolation and screening of white rot fungi from this particular 56 
habitat for biological pretreatment of lignocellulo sic biomass.  57 
In this study, we more specifically aimed: 1) to sc reen ligninolytic white rot fungi with high enzyme activities and to 58 
enhance the enzyme production by the replacement of  glucose with barley straw, and 2) to illustrate th e effect of 59 
biological pretreatment via TG/DTG analysis of the untreated and pretreated barley straw by the object ive fungal 60 
strain. The process we used is summarized in the ex perimental flowchart Fig. 1. 61 
Materials and methods 62 
Organisms 63 
Fungal fruiting bodies and decayed wood were collec ted from the Olympic National Park on the peninsula  of 64 
Washington State. Eighty six fungal strains with di fferent morphotypes were isolated and purified by p lacing pieces 65 
of each specimen on PDA (potato dextrose agar) medi um. The pure cultures were preserved on PDA slants at 4 °C 66 
and activated at 28 °C on PDA plates for one week b efore use. 67 
Primary screening on solid media 68 
To evaluate the ability of the 86 fungal strains (n amed BBEL0901 to BBEL0986) to produce lignin4degrad ing 69 
enzymes, guaiacol oxidation and dye decolorization were employed as initial screening methods. Screeni ng was 70 
carried out in Petri dishes (90 mm diameter) with a pproximately 14 ml of BSM (basal solid medium) cont aining 71 
indicators. The BSM medium composition was as follo ws: 10.0 g/l glucose, 0.2 g/l KH 2PO 4, 0.05 g/l MgSO 4·7H 2O, 72 Page 3 of 23
https://mc06.manuscriptcentral.com/cjm-pubsCanadian Journal of MicrobiologyDraft0.01 g/l CaCl 2·2H 2O, 0.22 g/l ammonium tartrate, 2.9 g/l 2, 24dimethy lsuccinic acid, 0.1 g/l thiamine, 0.1% (v/v) 73 
Tween 80, 1.5 mmol/l veratryl alcohol, 20 g/l agar and 10 ml/l trace elements. The trace elements cont ained 80 mg/l 74 
CuSO 4·5H 2O, 50 mg/l Na 2MoO 4·2H 2O, 33 mg/l MnSO 4·H 2O, 43 mg/l ZnSO 4·7H 2O, 50 mg/l FeSO 4·7H 2O. Glucose, 75 
thiamine, Tween 80, veratryl alcohol and trace elem ents were filter sterilized and added after autocla ving, as was the 76 
indicator compound guaiacol (0.1 g/l). Two dye indi cators, azure B (0.1 g/l) and Poly R4478 (0.1 g/l),  were added to 77 
the media before autoclaving. 78 
Three 54mm diameter agar plugs of active mycelia pr e4cultured on PDA plates were inoculated onto BSM p lates 79 
containing the indicators. All plates were incubate d at 28 °C for 2 weeks. In presence of guaiacol the  ligninolytic 80 
enzyme positive strains can be detected by the form ation of a reddish4brown halo. The ligninolytic enz ymes can also 81 
be observed as a colorless zone around the fungal c olonies on the BSM plates with dyes.  82 
Secondary screening by liquid culture 83 
Sixteen ligninolytic enzyme positive strains select ed during primary screening were further screened i n liquid 84 
medium for laccase, LiP, and MnP activity. Ten agar  plugs (3 mm in diameter) of the selected strains w ere 85 
inoculated into 5004ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing  100 ml of the BLM (basal liquid medium). BLM is BS M 86 
without agar. All strains were grown in triplicate at 28 °C and 150 rpm for 2 weeks. Ligninolytic enzy mes (laccase, 87 
MnP, and LiP) were determined every two days in tri plicate. 88 
Biological pretreatment of barley straw and improve ment of laccase activity 89 
Barley straw powder (particles between 0.425 mm and  0.850 mm) from Washington State was used for biolo gical 90 
pretreatment by Trametes versicolor  BBEL0970. The pre4grown fungal mycelia in Potato D extrose Broth (PDB) 91 
were collected and washed via centrifugation. The w ashed mycelia were then inoculated into sterile bar ley straw 92 
medium, the composition of which was the same with BLM except that glucose was replaced with barley st raw. The 93 
fungus was cultured in 5004ml Erlenmeyer flasks at 28 °C and 150 rpm for 24 days and all the experimen ts were 94 
performed in triplicate. The pretreated barley stra w was collected and oven4dried at 65 °C for thermogravimetric (TG) 95 
analysis. Simultaneously, the fermentation broth wa s collected every two days by filtration and centri fugation for 96 
determination of laccase activity. 97 
Enzyme assays 98 
For laccase activity, 2, 2’4azino4bis4(34ethylbenzo thiazoline464sulphonic acid) (ABTS, Sigma) was used  as the 99 
substrate (More et al. 2011). The assay mixture (1 ml) contained 100 mM buffer, 1 mM ABTS (final conce ntration), 100 Page 4 of 23
https://mc06.manuscriptcentral.com/cjm-pubsCanadian Journal of MicrobiologyDraftand 20 µl appropriately diluted crude enzyme. For s creening, laccase was assayed in acetic acid4sodium  acetate 101 
buffer at pH 4.5. For optimal pH assay of different  laccases, enzyme activity was assayed in different  buffers as 102 
described below. The absorbance increase of assay m ixture was monitored at 420 nm (ε 420  = 36.0 /mM/cm) in a UV4 103 
visible spectrophotometer.  104 
MnP activity was assayed by the oxidation of 1mM Mn SO 4 in 50 mM sodium malonate (pH 4.5), in the presence  of 105 
0.1 mM H 2O2. Manganic ions (Mn 3+ ), form a complex with malonate, which absorbs at 2 70 nm (ε 270  = 11.59 106 
/mM/cm) (Murugesan et al. 2007).  107 
Determination of LiP was performed by monitoring th e decolorization of azure B according to Archibald (Archibald 108 
1992). The assay mixture (1 ml) contained 32 µM azu re B (final concentration) and 100 µM H 2O2 in 50 mM sodium 109 
tartrate buffer (pH 4.5). The reaction was initiate d by adding hydrogen peroxide and the optical densi ty decrease was 110 
monitored at 651 nm (ε 651  = 48.8 /mM/cm). Enzyme reactions were performed in  triplicate and controls were carried 111 
out without the addition of enzyme or H 2O2. The enzyme activities were expressed as internati onal units (U), defined 112 
as the amount of enzyme needed to produce 1 µmol of  products per minute at 30 °C and presented as U/ml . 113 
TG analysis 114 
TG analysis was conducted in a Mettler4Toledo TG an alyzer (TGA/SDTA851 e, Mettler4Toledo, Inc., Columbus, 115 
OH). Approximately 6 mg of each sample was loaded i nto an open alumina pan and TG analysis was carried  out at 116 
the heating rate of 10 °C/min, with the decompositi on range being from 25 °C to 600 °C. The inert gas for 117 
thermogravimetric experiments was nitrogen with a f low rate of 20 ml/min. In order to avoid unexpected  oxidative 118 
decomposition, nitrogen was used to purge the furna ce for 2 h to establish an inert environment before  starting each 119 
run. To verify the reproducibility of weight loss c urves, duplicate runs of each sample were performed  under the 120 
same experimental conditions. The approximate overl apping of two weight loss curves from two separate test runs 121 
was considered as reasonable agreement. Otherwise, another two runs were performed then to determine w hich one 122 
should be chosen. Differential thermogravimetry (DT G) curves were calculated on basis of the TG data o f each 123 
sample. The untreated material was used as the cont rol sample. 124 
Molecular identification 125 
Fungal DNA was isolated from liquid nitrogen frozen  mycelia with CTAB (cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide ) in 126 
the presence of β4mercaptoethanol and polyvinylpyrr olidone, followed by organic extractions and isopro panol 127 
precipitation (Jasalavich et al. 2000). The ITS (in ternal transcription spacers) region of the ribosom al DNA was 128 Page 5 of 23
https://mc06.manuscriptcentral.com/cjm-pubsCanadian Journal of MicrobiologyDraftamplified by PCR from extracted DNA using the prime r pair of ITS1 (TCC GTA GGT GAA CCT GCG G) and 129 
ITS4 (TCC TCC GCT TAT TGA TAT GC). The fragments ob tained were approximately 700 bp based on agarose 130 
gel electrophoresis. Prior to sequencing, the PCR p roducts were cleaned using a QIAquick PCR purificat ion column 131 
(Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) according to the man ufacturer’s recommendations. The purified fragments  were 132 
then cloned using the pGEM ® 4T Easy Vector Systems (Promega) and sequenced usi ng primers T7 and SP6. The 133 
consensus sequences obtained were corrected manuall y for errors and the most homologous sequences were  134 
compared with those in the National Center for Biot echnology Information Nucleotide Sequence Database by using 135 
the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) algor ithm (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast). 136 
Results 137 
Primary screening on BSM plates 138 
Fig. 2 shows guaiacol oxidation and dye decolorizat ion on plates with the characteristic halo zones di splayed by 139 
strains BBEL0901, BBEL0902, BBEL0922, BBEL0958, BBE L0968, BBEL0970, and BBEL0973. Of the 86 strains 140 
tested on BSM plates, 16 (18.6%) and 73 (84.9%) str ains showed Poly R4478 and azure B decolorization, 141 
respectively. 21 (24.4%) of the 86 strains exhibite d the ability to oxidate guaiacol, and most reddish 4brown halos 142 
appeared earlier (about 143 days) than dyes decolor ization. Four strains (BBEL0901, BBEL0902, BBEL0958 , and 143 
BBEL0973) showed considerably higher abilities to c ompletely decolorize Poly R4478 within 2 weeks with  144 
homogeneous decolorization pattern (Fig. 2e through  2h). Azure B was more easily degraded than Poly R4 478 145 
because all strains able to decolorize Poly R4478 c ould also degrade azure B, while all strains able t o degrade azure 146 
B were not able to decolorize Poly R4478. According  to the results on primary screening plates, sixtee n strains that 147 
showed deep decolorization of the dyes or a dark co lor reaction with guaiacol were selected for second ary evaluation 148 
in liquid culture (Table 1). 149 
Ligninolytic characterization of the sixteen strain s 150 
Upon fermentation, no LiP activity was detected in any of the strains. MnP activity was detected in 12  strains of the 151 
16 strains tested; however, the activities were ver y low (Data not shown). For laccase, five of the si xteen strains 152 
(BBEL0901, BBEL0902, BBEL0970, BBEL0972 and BBEL097 3) were able to produce detectable extracellular 153 
laccase and the level of laccase activities varied significantly among the fungi tested (Fig. 3), whic h might be due to 154 
the difference of strain taxa and characteristics. The laccase activity of BBEL0970 was notably higher  than the other 155 
four laccase producers, and the highest level of ac tivity reached 3.14 U/ml after 8 days of fermentati on. The result of 156 Page 6 of 23
https://mc06.manuscriptcentral.com/cjm-pubsCanadian Journal of MicrobiologyDraftligninolytic enzyme activities in liquid culture in dicated that strain BBEL0970 was a potential strain  with higher 157 
laccase activity and was therefore chosen for the f ollowing biological pretreatment. The effect of pH value on the 158 
laccase actvity showed that the laccase preferred a cidic conditions for substrate (ABTS) transformatio n, with the 159 
optimum pH of 2.5 and higher relative activities ov er a broad pH range from 1.8 to 4.0, which is undou btedly 160 
favorable for biotechnological application.  161 
Based on the performance on plates and enzyme produ ction in liquid culture, an attempt was made to cor relate 162 
decolorization or color reaction with the activity of ligninolytic enzymes. Combined Table 1 and Fig. 3, it is obvious 163 
that the ability to oxidize guaiacol and laccase ac tivity appeared to be directly correlated. The five  strains which 164 
generated dark reddish4brown halos on the guaiacol plates demonstrated higher laccase activities. Ther efore, 165 
guaiacol oxidation on plates can be used as a simpl e and inexpensive method for screening for laccase producing 166 
fungal strains. However, there is no correlation be tween the special substrate and the special strain that can produce 167 
MnP and LiP. Improper culture condition might be th e main reason of low or no MnP and LiP activities. It was 168 
reported that shaken condition is more suitable tha n stationary condition for laccase production, howe ver, MnP and 169 
LiP production was higher under stationary culture than agitation condition (Dhouib et al. 2005). 170 
Enhanced laccase production under ligninolytic cond ition 171 
Comparison of laccase production under different co nditions with barley straw and glucose, respectivel y, as the sole 172 
carbon source was conducted in this part. Results d isplayed in Fig. 4 showed laccase production with p rolonged 173 
incubation times were rather different between the two conditions. Based on the mycelium growth, strai n  BBEL0970 174 
accumulated principally biomass during the initial 12 days in glucose medium. The laccase activity inc reased sharply 175 
when glucose was exhausted, reached the highest lev el (6.5 U/ml) on the 20 th  day, and decreased quickly afterwards, 176 
with an activity of 2.4 U/ml on the 24 th  day. While in barley straw medium, the laccase act ivity was noticeably 177 
enhanced starting on the 6th  day and remained at high level throughout fermenta tion, with a maximum of 10.3 U/ml 178 
on the 20 th  day, which was 58.5% higher than that of glucose. The fluctuation of the laccase activity between 5.2  179 
U/ml and 10.3 U/ml provides a hint of relationship between biodegradation of barley straw and laccase production 180 
by BBEL0970. The high laccase activity in barley st raw medium also alludes to biodelignification of li gnocellulosic 181 
biomass and biodegradation of xenobiotics. 182 
Thermogravimetry (TG) analysis of barley straw samp les 183 Page 7 of 23
https://mc06.manuscriptcentral.com/cjm-pubsCanadian Journal of MicrobiologyDraftTG analysis is a commonly used technique to study t hermal events during pyrolysis of biomass and it ca n be used 184 
primarily to determine the composition of materials  (Aboulkas and El Harfi 2009). Therefore, the TG An alysis was 185 
designed for verifying the efficiency of the strain  BBEL0970 in biological pretreatment of biomass. Th e TG 186 
thermograms and derivative thermogravimetry (DTG) c urves of the control and pretreated samples by the strain 187 
BBEL0970 are shown in Fig. 5A and 5B, respectively.  It can be observed that both of the samples showed  the typical 188 
decomposition behavior of lignocellulosic biomass w ith three stages of weight loss during the overall process, with 189 
the moisture loss occurred up to approximately 150 °C followed by active pyrolysis and passive pyrolys is. It’s 190 
reported that hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin are decomposed at 1504300, 2754300, and 2504500 °C,  respectively. 191 
Therefore, the shoulder peak of the DTG curve at lo w temperature around 250 °C is generally considered  as the 192 
result of thermal degradation of hemicellulose, the  main successive weight loss around 330 °C by cellu lose, and the 193 
long tail at high temperature corresponds to lignin  volatilization. Difference between the control and  pretreated 194 
samples arose distinctly at the active pyrolysis st age (Fig. 5B), resulting mainly from the thermal de composition of 195 
cellulose and hemicellulose. The hemicellulose shou lder peak of the control sample was overlapped in t he cellulose 196 
main peak (peak b) and it’s hard to be observed.  A fter biological pretreatment, the overlapping betwe en 197 
devolatilization peaks of cellulose and hemicellulo se was reduced and the main decomposition peak (pea k a) shifted 198 
evidently to higher temperature, resulting in an ob vious shoulder peak (peak c) at low temperature. Th is difference 199 
indicates the obvious changes on thermal behaviors of cellulose and hemicellulose after biological pre treatment with 200 
BBEL0970. 201 
Based on the data from TG and DTG curves, the integ ral method of Coats and Redfern (1964), which has b een 202 
successfully used for research on the decomposition  kinetics of solid substrate, was used to determine  the apparent 203 
activation energy of decomposition at different tem peratures. The results on kinetics parameters of th ermal 204 
decomposition of the control and pretreated samples  are shown in Table 2. As shown in Table 2, the pyr olytic 205 
characteristics of both barley straw samples could fit the kinetics model well, with all R 2 values being above 0.9. The 206 
start devolatilization temperature shifted obviousl y to higher temperature after biological pretreatme nt which might 207 
be due to the consumption of simple nutrition in ba rley straw by BBEL0970. The activation energy at lo w 208 
temperatures decreased from 15.18 kJ/mol to 13.44 k J/mol after biological pretreatment, which might be  caused by 209 
biological degradation of hemicellulose after pretr eatment with the fungus. The conversion ratios duri ng this period 210 
were also decreased obviously from 13.39% to 5.16%,  which strongly suggested the degradation and decon struction 211 Page 8 of 23
https://mc06.manuscriptcentral.com/cjm-pubsCanadian Journal of MicrobiologyDraftof hemicellulose. At the stage for decomposition of  main components (2504350 °C for the control sample  and 2504 212 
400 °C for the pretreated sample), more than 80% of  the devolatilization part for both samples was dev olatilized and 213 
the activation energy was slightly increased from 6 5.56 kJ/mol to 71.81 kJ/mol which might be caused b y 214 
biodegradation of armphous cellulose by the white r ot fungus. Notable decreases on the activation ener gy and pre4 215 
exponential factor at high temperatures (3504550 °C  for the control sample and 4004550 °C for the pret reated sample) 216 
were observed between the pretreated and control sa mples, indicating easier devolatilization of lignin  after biological 217 
pretreatment.  218 
Strain identification of strain BBEL0970 219 
The morphological characters of the fruit body of t he srtain BBEL0970 (leathery texture, cap with rust 4brown zones) 220 
resembled that of common wood4decaying fungi, Trametes versicolor . The molecular identification of the srtain 221 
BBEL0970 was performed by internal transcribed spac er (ITS) sequencing. The apparent size of PCR ampli cation 222 
products was about 700 bp. A comparative analysis o f the ITS sequence by BLASTn, Clustalx and Mega2 so ftware 223 
with the neighbor4joining method revealed that the strain BBEL0970 was enrolled into a cluster contain ing and was 224 
found to be nearly identical to T. versicolor  UBCF20357 (Fig. 6) with more than 99% sequenece si milarity. It was 225 
therefore identified as T. versicolor  BBEL0970. The submitted nucleotide sequence was pr ovided a GenBank 226 
accession number KM819087. 227 
Discussion 228 
Ligninolytic fungi, which have the ability of degra de lignin, are of particular interest during the pa st several decades. 229 
Tremendous attention has been paid to screening of ligninolytic fungi due to the important application  of ligninolytic 230 
enzymes in biotechnological and environmental proce sses (Chander et al. 2014; Manavalan et al. 2015). Many 231 
compounds have been employed in strain screening of  ligninolytic fungi and guaiacol is one of the indi cators 232 
commonly used. Ligninolytic enzymes produced by fun gi can turn guaiacol reddish4brown, showing a non4 233 
homogeneous oxidation pattern. Similarly, azure B ( an azo dye) is adopted in LiP enzyme activity deter mination on 234 
the basis of its decolorization. (1992). Another po lymeric dye, Poly R4478 (polyanthraquinone, which i s a 235 
polyvinylamine sulfonated backbone with an anthrapy ridone chromophore), bears some structural similari ty to lignin 236 
and changes color when transformed via biological o xidation (Moreira et al. 2004). Thus, azure B and P oly R4478 237 
can also act as indicators identifying microbial cu ltures capable of degrading colored organics and re lated molecules 238 
with aromatic structures. Results of our research s uggested that guaiacol was oxidized by white rot fu ngi much 239 Page 9 of 23
https://mc06.manuscriptcentral.com/cjm-pubsCanadian Journal of MicrobiologyDraftearlier than the dyes were decolorized, which demon strated that it was more efficient to use guaiacol as the indicator 240 
for screening of ligninolytic white rot fungi. The screened T. versicolor  is one of the most common white rot fungi in 241 
North America and has the high potential in lignin biodegradation. As a typical basidiomycete that can  produce three 242 
ligninolytic enzymes, T. versicolor  BBEL0970 produces laccase as the predominant ligni nolytic enzyme. 243 
Increase of laccase production will contribute to h igh amounts of laccase needed for industrial applic ations as well as 244 
lignin degradation. As a secondary metabolite, lacc ase production is highly dependent on the culture c onditions of 245 
the fungus. Laccase activity can be influenced by m any factors, such as inducers, pH, aeration and var ious nutritional 246 
effects (Dhouib et al. 2005). The growing demand of  laccase application in biotechnology has brought a bout more 247 
studies on its production at commercially viable pr ices. Utilization of lignocellulosic wastes in lacc ase production 248 
reduces the production cost and simultaneously prov ides a promising way of converting agricultural res idues into 249 
high4value products (Risna and Suhirman 2002). In r ecent years, various lignocellulosic agricultural r esidues, such as 250 
rice bran, wheat bran, and barley bran have been su ggested as substitute carbon sources or inducers fo r ligninolytic 251 
enzyme production by white rot fungi (Tišma et al. 2012; Cambria et al. 2011; Aydinoğlu and Sargin 201 3). 252 
Although laccase activity in T. versicolor  could be enhanced considerably by taking rice bran  as carbon source, the 253 
activity was only 22 U/g of bran (Chawachart et al.  2004). The combined effect of xylidine addition an d glucose 254 
suppression with solid lignin induction enhanced la ccase activity of T. versicolor  to 1.58 U/ml (Xavier et al. 2007). 255 
This work explores the combination of laccase produ ction utilizing barley straw as the sole carbon res ource and 256 
biological pretreatment of barley straw by BBEL0970  in liquid fermentation. The changes in composition  of the 257 
pretreated barley straw via TG analysis implied the  modification of lignocellulose as well as the indu ction of barley 258 
straw to laccase. Laccase production with barley st raw rather than glucose as the sole carbon source i s of great 259 
significance for its commercial utilization. Compar ed with reported effects from other biomass, our re sult gave the 260 
most predominant increase in laccase activity, whic h reached 1030 U/g of barley straw, suggesting high  potential for 261 
laccase production from barley straw. In addition t o acting as the carbon source for fungal growth, li gnocellulose 262 
might also play the role of an inducer in laccase p roduction and stabilizer in laccase activity (Tišma  et al. 2012). The 263 
concentration of inducers present in the barley str aw medium is rather low, so there is the possibilit y of improving 264 
laccase production by increasing the inducer concen tration or adding other inducers. Moreover, it was reported that a 265 
higher yield of laccase could be achieved by T. versicolor  in nitrogen rich media rather than nitrogen limite d media 266 
(Heinzkill et al. 1998). Therefore, intensive studi es on adjusting the inducers and carbon to nitrogen  ratio will be 267 Page 10 of 23
https://mc06.manuscriptcentral.com/cjm-pubsCanadian Journal of MicrobiologyDraftfavorable for enhancing and inducing laccase produc tion by BBEL0970 using barley straw. Moreover, the present 268 
work is bringing out further exploration on integra ted process of low4cost laccase production and effi cient 269 
pretreatment of barley straw in solid4state ferment ation. 270
