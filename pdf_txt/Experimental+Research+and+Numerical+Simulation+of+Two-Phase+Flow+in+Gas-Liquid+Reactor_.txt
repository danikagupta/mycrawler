Introduction
This chapter provides an introduction to the physical problem addressed in this
thesis and the associated issues.
The ﬁrst section focuses on the general industrial issue that led to the thesis’s open
questions. It includes a description of a steam generator and the vibrational risks
encountered, as well as the industrial tools used to apprehend and predict these
phenomena.
The second section deals with the experimental study of ﬂows similar to those in
steam generators. The ﬁrst part presents the current understanding of ﬂow regimes
and their interaction with a cylinder in academic cases. The second part explores
the understanding of ﬂows in industrial conﬁgurations.
The third section addresses numerical physical modeling for the description of ﬂows
in steam generators. The ﬁrst part provides a brief overview of models one can
found in the literature and their limitations regarding our study, while the second
part presents the model developed at CEA and its limitations.
The ﬁnal section outlines the challenges in reproducing multiphase ﬂows for ﬂuid-
structure interaction. It raises questions about modeling and introduces essential
modeling components for accurately replicating these ﬂows.Summary
16Chapter 1 – Introduction
General introduction
The ﬂows studied in this thesis lie at the intersection of two major ﬁelds within ﬂuid mechanics:
multiphase and turbulence. Multiphase focuses on the interaction between two phases, often a
liquid and a gas or a gas and solid particles, while turbulence aims to study the dynamics of a
ﬂuid when its velocity is high enough to exhibit a wide range of ﬂuid scales. When considered
separately, both of these areas present numerous open questions and are characterized by high
complexity.
The interaction between multiphase ﬂows and turbulence, especially in the presence of walls,
remains far from being a fully understood domain. Indeed, there exists a wide collection of
complex dynamic and thermodynamic phenomena that can lead to the development or disap-
pearance and movement of drops, bubbles, or spray. These ﬂows are encountered both in nature,
through phenomena like particle dispersion in the atmosphere or bubbles in ocean currents, and
inindustrialapplicationssuchassteamproductionforenergygenerationorcombustioninrocket
engines.
Thus, understanding and modeling turbulent multiphase ﬂows present a signiﬁcant challenge
due to the variability and complexity of the encountered structures. It becomes necessary to
take into account property discontinuities between the ﬂuids, interactions between the phases,
the forces acting between these phases and their topology, among other factors. This complexity
then translates into the systems of equations to be solved, which are often non-linear and involve
numerous equations in order to predict their behavior accurately.
The wonder of ﬂuid mechanics lies precisely in these recurring phenomena in nature and
industry, which seem so simple to us because they are easily observable but are incredibly chal-
lenging to describe using our mathematical tools. An essential part of understanding ﬂows thus
involves ﬁnding similarities between phenomena that may be closely related, but on a slightly
diﬀerent system or on a reduced scale. In this chapter, we will attempt to present an easily
observable phenomenon that we try to replicate using similarities or reduced scales in an eﬀort
to better understand it. Ultimately, this will help us understand the challenges associated with
its modeling.
1.1 The primary circuit failure accident in steam generators
1.1.1 Flow induced vibrations in steam generators
Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs) are a type of nuclear power plant that uses water as coolant
and neutron moderator. They are composed of a primary circuit, a secondary circuit, and a
cooling circuit as presented in Figure 1.1.
The primary circuit is a closed system that operates water under high pressure (about 155
bar) to transfer heat generated by the nuclear reaction in the reactor to the secondary circuit.
The water in the primary circuit is heated to a temperature of around 300°C and high pressure
to keep it in a liquid state. This closed circuit also acts as a barrier to prevent the spread of
radioactive materials. The secondary circuit uses a Steam Generator (SG) to recover heat from
the primary circuit and turn it into steam, which is then used to drive a turbine to generate
electricity. The steam is produced at a pressure of 50-80bar. After passing through the turbine,
the steam is condensed in the cooling circuit using water from a cold source, such as a river or
the ocean. This water is either returned to the source at a slightly higher temperature or cooled
in an air cooler and re-injected into the cooling circuit. PWRs typically have two to four SGs

(GV in Figure 1.1), which are large, circular chambers containing thousands of tubes (inverted
U-shaped tubes called tubular beams) that carry water from the primary circuit. These tubes
are about 20mm in diameter and 10m high, and are held in place by spacer plates and anti-
vibration bars , as presented in Figure 1.2. The curved portion of the tubes, located at the top
of the SG, has a maximum radius of curvature of 1.5m. As the water passes through the tubes
and spacer plates, it gradually turns into steam as presented in Figure 1.2.
A monitoring system is in place to detect any leaks between the primary and secondary cir-
cuits through the tubes. This helps prevent contamination of the secondary circuit and prevents
SG tube rupture accidents. In the event of an accident, the diﬀerence in pressure between the
primary and secondary circuits can cause a spill of contaminated water and steam, which can
escape as steam. To prevent further damage, it is important to isolate the SG from the rest of
the system.
The phenomenon of rupture is caused by the repeated vibrations and stresses on the struc-
tures over large cycles due to the two-phase ﬂow. These types of accidents are rare, can have
various causes, and are generally not dangerous. They tend to occur in the top cross-ﬂow part
of the SG, where the tubes are horizontal and the void fraction (the proportion of the volume
occupied by the vapor) is high. However, they can still require an extended shutdown of the
SG to repair it. For example, in 1991, a leakage accident at the Mihama Power Plant in Japan
led to a shutdown of the SG for two years. The accident was caused by misaligned vibration
bars. To prevent such accidents, SG tubes are regularly inspected during scheduled shutdowns
to check for wear and damage. If the condition of the materials is not suﬃcient, the SG may
need to be replaced through a series of heavy operations. According to the French Institute

of Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN), 18 replacements were carried out between
1990 and 2010, or about one per year. In 2008, the Fessenheim Reactor No. 2 in Alsace, France
experienced a leak from the primary circuit to the secondary circuit. This led to a shutdown
of the reactor. The leak was caused by a crack at the beginning of the SG U-tube curvature,
which was determined to be the result of fatigue due to excessive vibration. This vibration was
traced back to the non-uniform installation of the anti-vibration bars during the construction of
the Fessenheim reactor in 1978. It is then critical to understand what kind of phenomenon can
lead to such excessive vibrations leading to the rupture of the tubes. Some clues can be found
studying single phase ﬂows.
Another conﬁguration where this phenomenon could occur is the design of new modular
architectures. These more compact designs have the potential to lead to the exploration of
novel conﬁgurations, such as IRIS (International Reactor Innovative and Secure)[7] presented
in Figure 1.3 or the one proposed in Korea presented in Figure 1.4, which feature a helical
arrangement of tubes of the primary circuit in the SG. Tubes can be installed in triangular
and square conﬁgurations or any combination of the previous conﬁguration. This design are
intended to enhance heat transfer between the primary and secondary circuits. Six to eight of
these SGs can be installed between the core support body and the reactor pressure vessel.
1.1.2 Modeling the vibrations of tubes in steam generators
The U-bend tubes at the top of the SG are subjected to an upward ﬂow of steam and water
with a high void fraction. These tubes are exposed to random forces caused by turbulence
and intermittent impacts from bubbles or gas pockets. There are two types of ﬂuid-structure
interactions that can occur in this situation:
mWhen the forces acting on the tubes are not coupled to the motion of the tube. The
problem can be separated into a ﬂuid mechanical problem and a structural problem. In

two-phase ﬂow, this interaction can be caused by turbulence and the intermittent presence
of bubbles or gas pockets. Random excitations due to turbulence are called Turbulence
Induced Vibrations.
mWhen the forces acting on the tubes are coupled to the tube motion. This can be seen
as the ﬂuid adapting its motion to the motion of the tubes. This phenomenon can lead
to instabilities. Because of the strong amplitudes at stack, the coupling between the ﬂuid
and the structure can be dangerous as presented in Figure 1.5.

[93].
The modeling of the mechanical loading exerted by the ﬂow on a ﬂexible tube is predicated
on the hypothesis that the ﬂuid force can be separated into two distinct phenomena : a random
excitation and a coupling phenomenon. The random excitation is modeled as a ﬂuid force
FRandomindependent of the tube motion. It is related to the turbulent ﬂuctuations generated

vibratory amplitude of the structure. The coupling phenomenon is modeled as a ﬂuid force

As depicted in Figure 1.6, for a critical ﬂow velocity Vc, the total damping Cf+Csof the sys-
tem becomes zero, resulting in a ﬂuid-elastic instability that manifests as an exponential growth
of the vibration amplitude. This velocity can be studied through the reduced velocity Vr, a
dimensionless number that represents the ratio between the ﬂow velocity and a characteristic
vibration velocity of the tube. It is deﬁned as Vr=U
f0D, whereUis the ﬂow velocity, Dis the
diameter of the tube, and f0is a characteristic vibration frequency. It can also be seen as the
ratio between the inertia associated with the ﬂow and the ﬂexibility of the tube.
Fluid-elastic instability can lead to wear and even rapid rupture of SG tubes. However, this
instability does not allow us to predict the phenomenon of tube fatigue that emerges over much

longer periods of time. To do this, the computation of the general system response with all
the terms by time integration is necessary. The complexity arises from the random nature of
the excitation caused by ﬂow ﬂuctuations, which makes it challenging to analyze the system’s
temporal behavior directly.
A deterministic signal is characterized by its amplitude and frequency, following a known math-
ematical law with respect to time. The knowledge of this law enables a deﬁnite and unique
determination of the signal at any given time. In contrast, a random signal can result in various
outcomes within a given time interval, and it can only be described using mean values derived
from probability density functions. Since these functions are often unknown in practice, statis-
tical analyses rely on sets of means. However, for a stationary random signal, a powerful tool
known as spectral analysis can be applied. Spectral analysis allows the identiﬁcation of the
frequency content existing in the signal. It involves a study into Fourier’s space. This allows
the signal to be analyzed in terms of energy distribution across diﬀerent frequency bands. This
analysis of a signal’s frequency content is referred to as its spectrum. In the context of studying
forces, we focus on the Power Spectral Density (PSD, see section 2.4.1), which quantiﬁes the
variance of power within the examined physical process and is expressed in units of N2/Hz.
Figure 1.7 is an example of a force spectrum applied to a cylinder in a tubular beam.

Two-phase ﬂows are notably diﬀerent from single-phase ﬂows due to the diverse hydrody-
namic regimes they create. The combination of physical properties from the diﬀerent ﬂuids
and ﬂow characteristics within the two-phase ﬂuid can result in various spatial distributions
between phases, corresponding to diﬀerent ﬂow regimes. To conduct a precise analysis of FSI
in two-phase ﬂow, it becomes crucial to take into account these distinct ﬂow regimes.
1.2 Understanding phenomena in steam generators through ex-
periments
1.2.1 Topology of two-phase ﬂows in experiments
In order to understand the physical processes that can happen in a SG, it is important to identify
the topology of the ﬂow, called ﬂow regime. A ﬂow regime is a speciﬁc pattern of ﬂuid behavior
within a two-phase ﬂow system, characterized by the distribution and properties of the phases.
These regimes can be classiﬁed into three main categories:
mSeparated ﬂows are characterized by isolated phases, such as ﬁlm ﬂow on a plate, annular
ﬂow in a pipe, jet ﬂow, or stratiﬁed ﬂow.
mDispersed ﬂows operate with numerous individual bubbles of various types, such as bubbly
ﬂow with small, spherical or distorted bubbles.
mTransitional(orintermittent)ﬂowscanbedepictedasthetransitionbetweenseparatedand
dispersed ﬂows, and can include slug ﬂow with merging bubbles to form large cylindrical
gas regions, cap-bubbly ﬂow with cap-shaped bubbles, or churn-bubbly ﬂow with erratic
shape bubbles.
It is important to note that two-phase ﬂow behavior is highly dependent on system geometry,
bubble topology, bubble distribution, and ﬂow conditions, making it diﬃcult to create a univer-
sal map of ﬂow regimes. However, this classiﬁcation system provides a general understanding of
the diﬀerent types of ﬂow patterns that can occur in two-phase systems.
23Chapter 1 – Introduction
Figure 1.8: Images observed in a vertical 25.4 mm diameter pipe for diﬀerent regimes. From
left to right bubbly (dispersed), cap-bubbly (transitional), slug (transitional), churn-turbulent
(transitional) and annular ﬂows (separated). From [85].
In a SG various ﬂow regimes occur, ranging from bubbly ﬂow (dispersed) in the lower por-
tion to separated ﬂow in the upper portion, with intermittent regimes (such as cap and slug
ﬂow) in the middle. To study those regimes crossing the tubular beam of the SG, experimental
platforms of tube bundles were developed. K.Mao and T.Hibiki [79] proposed a ﬂow regime map
for cross-ﬂow tube bundles based on 8 experimental studies found in the literature, gathering
parallel triangular, normal square and normal triangular conﬁgurations with various gaps and
tube diameters. Figure 1.9 presents [79]’s map. The classiﬁcation is based on the 5 following
categories, as presented in Figure 1.8: bubbly ﬂow, cap bubbly ﬂow, churn ﬂow and annular ﬂow.
The bubbly ﬂow is characterized by a continuous liquid phase with dispersed small gas bub-
bles (smaller than the tube spacing). It is observed for low superﬁcial gas velocities (ﬂow rate of
gas over cross-sectional area, often denoted as jg) but a wide range of superﬁcial liquid velocities
(ﬂow rate of liquid over cross-sectional area, often denoted as jl). The ﬁnely dispersed bubbly
ﬂow is characterized by a highly turbulent ﬂow with small bubbles prevented from coalescing
and large ones breaking-up. It is observed for high superﬁcial liquid velocities and intermediate
superﬁcial gas velocities.
The cap bubbly ﬂow is a bubbly ﬂow with cap bubbles that can be larger than the tube
spacing. It is observed for intermediate superﬁcial gas velocities and low/intermediate super-
ﬁcial liquid velocities. Actually, the rise of gas ﬂow rate impulses the coalescence of smaller
bubbles whereas moderate liquid ﬂow rate doesn’t induce high intensity turbulence that could
break large bubbles.
The churn ﬂow is characterized by a chaotic mixture of liquid and gas driven by gravitational
eﬀects. It is observed for intermediate superﬁcial velocities of both gas and liquid. It can be
noticed that downward movements can happen for short periods.
24Chapter 1 – Introduction
The annular ﬂow is characterized by continuous gas with liquid droplets in the core of the
tube bundle and continuous liquid ﬁlms over walls and tubes. It is observed for reduced liquid
superﬁcial velocities and high gas superﬁcial velocities.

Figure 1.10: Regime ﬂow map of DIVA experiment (left), described in the following section.
The superfacial velocities are based on the gap between the tubes as for [79]. The categories are
based on void fraction αPDF observations, as presented next to the map (right).
The DIVA experiment, carried out at CEA, involves a tube bundle conﬁguration similar
to those found in steam generators. Its primary purpose is to investigate vibrations occurring
in square-pitch bundles. The experimental setup is composed of an upward channel with a
25Chapter 1 – Introduction
rectangular cross-section measuring 0.18m×0.3m, hosting a square tube bundle of 5×3
rigid tubes, with a pitch ratio of 1.5. This setup allows for experimentation with various ﬂow
scenarios,includingwaterﬂow,airﬂow,orair-waterﬂow. Thefollowingsectionwillprovideafull

generators. Figure 1.10 is the ﬂow regime map of DIVA experiment. The void fraction PDF of
each ﬂow operating conditions allowed to distinguish the experimental tests into 4 categories :
bubbly (dispersed), slug (transitional), churn (transitional) and annular (separated).
Figure 1.9 shows the map proposed by [79] by comparison with the experiment made by [136],
with 5×10normal square conﬁguration with a tube diameter of D= 2cm and a gap of 1.5D. It
highlights the good agreement between the DIVA, [136] and [79] conﬁgurations. The comparison
between the map and experimental data reveals a good agreement between the two and DIVA,
indicating the reliability of the proposed maps. Although, the ﬂow regimes are similar, [79]
gives a more detailed map and identiﬁes the so-called slug category from DIVA as a cap-bubbly
regime. The DIVA experiment lacks visual data for the diﬀerent ﬂow regimes. To address
this limitation, [136] provides visualizations of some regimes, as shown in Figure 1.11. These
visualizations oﬀer valuable insights into the characteristics of diﬀerent ﬂow regimes within the
tube bundle conﬁguration. At the left a bubbly ﬂow around the tubes is presented. It highlights
the presence of some bubble clusters and few 3Deﬀects (along the tube). At the center a churn
ﬂow is presented. It highlights the heterogeneity of the ﬂow, 3Deﬀects and the presence of
gas pockets. At the right an annular ﬂow is presented. It highlights liquid ligaments, some 3D
eﬀects and mostly separated phases interactions.

Such maps are useful to understand the diﬀerent topologies but give no information on local
phenomena arising from those regimes. Then experimental studies of the interaction between
cylinders and the diﬀerent regimes are important. The study of single-phase ﬂow around a cylin-
der is a well-established area of research. For example, in single-phase ﬂow, diﬀerent patterns
was observed according to the Reynolds number Re=ρUD
µ, withρthe density, Uthe velocity,
D the diameter of the tube and µthe dynamic viscosity :
mWhenRe < 5, viscosity is dominant so that the ﬂow is laminar. Trajectories follow the
curvature of the cylinder.
26Chapter 1 – Introduction
mWhen 5<Re< 49, viscosity is less dominant but the ﬂow is still laminar. A detachment
point can be observed but the vorticies behind the cylinder are stable.
mWhen 49< Re < 300, the so-called Von Karman vortex appears. It creates alternate
vorticies behind the cylinder with the characteristic frequency of the conﬁguration.
mWhen 300< Re < 105, the ﬂow transitions to turbulence in the wake but the boundary
layer is still laminar.
mWhen 105<Re< 4.106, the boundary layer over the cylinder transitions to turbulence.
mWhenRe> 4×106, the ﬂow is completely turbulent.
The instability of Von Karman (VK) is manifested by an alternating swirling detachment
that induces ﬂuctuating stress. The vortex is a phenomenon where the speed of the ﬂuid is
higher and the pressure lower than in the main ﬂow. Thus, at the back of a cylinder this area
is characterized by the presence of a depression area. In order to understand this phenomenon,
we can deﬁne the number of Strouhal Stwhich links the upstream speed U, the diameter of the
cylinderDand the ﬂow frequency ffof the instability, by:
St=ffD
U. (1.3)
In single phase, for Rebetween 102and106we can observe a characteristic StVKof the
order of 0.2 with a quasi-random distribution of standard deviation of the order of 10%.
Regarding two-phase ﬂow around a single cylinder, Inoue and al.[44] described the behavior of
an upward uniform bubbly air-water ﬂow around a cylinder for void fractions between 0 and
0.24andRebetween 104and105. He listed some important observations. The area near the
separation point produces high local void fraction 3 to 4 times the homogeneous volume fraction.
A high void fraction area is situated behind the cylinder. As the liquid velocity increases, its
void fraction peak increases and its position come closer to the cylinder. A liquid layer where
bubbles can hardly penetrate can be produced in the front and in the rear of the cylinder due to
the static pressure gradient. Its thickness respectively increases and decreases in the front and
in the rear with increasing ﬂow velocity. This phenomenon is visible on Figure 1.12. Compared
to single phase ﬂow, the width and the length of the wake are smaller due to the buoyancy force
on bubbles and higher turbulent intensity.
1.2.2 Two-phase ﬂows in industrial conﬁgurations
Most of the literature dealing with upward two-phase ﬂows giving interesting local data involve
ﬂows going through tube bundles or spacer grid [146, 147, 31, 137, 70]. Regarding two-phase
ﬂow across horizontal in-line tube bundles, the local data available is still limited [144]. Iwaki
[46] performed bubbly ﬂows around an upward tube bundle at low void fraction. He observed
that for liquid superﬁcial velocities under 0.1m/s bubbles stay between the tubes whereas when
the liquid superﬁcial velocities is over 0.1m/s, bubbles are driven into the wake behind the
tubes.
Murakawa [89] experimental setup operated with the bubbly, transitional (called transition)
and separated (called intermittent) ﬂow regimes for square (called in-line) and triangular (called
staggered) conﬁgurations as presented in Figures 1.13 and 1.14. In this study, we focus on
27Chapter 1 – Introduction

only triangular conﬁguration observations of bubbly, intermittent, and separated ﬂows. For
bubbly ﬂow, numerous bubbles were observed passing between the tubes, with some bubbles
also observed behind the tubes, as noted by Iwaki [46]. This resulted in a higher void fraction
in the upstream region compared to behind the tubes. In the case of intermittent ﬂow, the
void fraction was found to be almost uniformly distributed throughout the tube bundle. For
separatedﬂow, largegasstructureswereobservedpassingintermittently, accompaniedbyreverse
ﬂow in the near-wall region. Large bubbles were observed to occupy the horizontal maximum
and vertical minimum gaps, leading to a lower void fraction in the horizontal minimum gap.
However, experimental data for all the regimes is still lacking. Indeed, to fully understand
these mechanisms under the other regimes, experimental studies using specialized instrumenta-
tion for water-steam ﬂow are necessary. Moreover, this instrumentation is not yet fully oper-
ational, and constructing a water-steam experimental facility is cost-prohibitive. As a result,
research and development eﬀorts in this area currently rely on tests using simulating ﬂuids (such
as water-freon and water-air) or analytical experiments.
In order to better understand and quantify the vibratory phenomena of SG tubes, experi-
mental work has been carried out for about forty years at CEA, on a reduced scale. In order to
limit the cost of installations and for safety reasons, these studies are carried out with simulating
ﬂuids, in this case water and air instead of water and steam. The DIVA experimental setup
hosted at CEA, presented in Figure 1.15, is dedicated to the study of vibrations in square-pitch
bundle. It thus reproduces on a reduced scale the FSI in the SG which currently equip the 32
nuclear reactors of 900 MWe and the 20 reactors of 1300MWeof France. The loop is equipped
with a pump able to deliver 5 to 300 L/sof water and an air compressor able to deliver up to
3000m3/hat an absolute pressure of 8 bar. The loop can thus operate in water ﬂow, air ﬂow

or air-water ﬂow. It allows reproducing regimes similar to the ones encountered in the SG. The
experimental setup is composed of an upward channel of 0.18m×0.3m rectangular section
in which can be set a square tube bundle made of 5×3rigid tubes, with a pitch ratio 1.5, as
presented in [95] and in Figure 1.15. A central ﬂexible tube can be set but will not be discussed
in this manuscript.
29Chapter 1 – Introduction
Figure 1.15: Photos of the DIVA experiment.
The Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the ﬂuid force (drag and lift directions) acting on the
central tube is calculated by measuring the random excitation for various volume ﬂow rates of
air and water. Speciﬁcations and veriﬁcations for single phase ﬂows were performed in Piteau
and al. [95]. It aims to understand and take into account the ﬂuctuations of the two-phase ﬂow
for the ﬂuid-elastic interaction. However, due to the complexity of the phenomenon (such as
bubble swarms, the emergence and the transition of several bubbly turbulent regimes, etc.), it
is not always possible experimentally to access to all ﬂow conditions and information because of
limited instrumentation. Then in order to get additional local information, the idea is to get a
numerical twin. Indeed, numerical simulation can play a fundamental role, as it allows access to
all quantities of interest and information that are not accessible or observable experimentally.
In order to simulate any conﬁguration similar to a SG, a quasi-steady general numerical
model must be built. Such a model is said "All-regimes". It describes ﬂow conﬁgurations where
multiple dispersed and continuous regions can be met. It can be seen as a smooth transitional
ﬂow between the diﬀerent ﬂow topologies previously introduced.
1.3 Advanced numerical models for two-phase ﬂows
1.3.1 Literature overview
In order to reproduce two-phase ﬂows it exists several methods that are suitable for speciﬁc ap-
plications [148, 32, 150, 85]. Then a compromise between precision and prediction must be done.
A more precise description is given in the appendix. To summarize, direct approaches like DNS
and LBM can only be used for precise small portion of industrial conﬁgurations because of their
computational cost and the need of further development. Statistical approaches are accessible
in industrial codes and their computational cost is relevant for our applications. Statistical ap-
proaches to ﬂuid ﬂow can be divided into two aspects: the statistical behavior within each phase,
known as Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS), and the statistical presence of interfaces.
The ﬁrst aspect involves decomposing any quantity into a mean ﬁeld and a ﬂuctuating ﬁeld. The
mean ﬁeld is calculated, while the ﬂuctuations are modeled. Unsteady methods called URANS
30Chapter 1 – Introduction
were developed to capture timescales separated from turbulence, but they violate the principle
of ergodicity, which states that ensemble averages and time averages are the same. From a
mathematical perspective, the ﬁltered equations of Large Eddy Simulations (LES) and URANS
equations are identical, with the only diﬀerence being the closure models. The second aspect
arises from the averaged equations, as the mean quantities eliminate the interfaces. Additional
equations are needed to account for the presence of interfaces. The popular approach is called
Euler-Euler because it treats both phases as coexisting ﬂuids, both as the "stage" ﬂuid, and
their mixture is characterized by a void fraction. This approach is much less computationally
demanding and allows for the simulation of real industrial geometries.
Figure 1.16: Comparison between Front-Tracking, Euler-Lagrange and Euler-Euler methods
from [63].
Numerical models that can simulate the complexity of two-phase ﬂows in a SG are called "all
regimes" and only few approaches have been proposed in the literature (see [102] and section
2.2.2). The Eulerian-Eulerian approach suggests solving both phases, with mass, momentum
and energy equations. These equations are coupled by the volume fraction of the phase and
the interfacial exchange terms for all three equations. The fundamental concept behind all-
regimes models is to deﬁne appropriate interfacial exchange terms for each regime topology.
These models combine a formulation able to deﬁne interfacial terms for dispersed bubbly regime
with another formulation that deﬁnes them for continuous ﬂows. Consequently, these methods
do not explicitly track or reconstruct the geometry of the liquid/gas interfaces, as Level-Set,
Phase Fields, or Volume Of Fluid method would typically do [135]. All-regimes models primar-
ily focus on solving the dynamics for average quantities across the phases. As a result, they are
particularly well-suited for scenarios involving multiple and complex bubble/droplet topologies.
The changes among diﬀerent "all-regimes" models primarily lie in how the intermediate regimes
between the two extremes (bubbly and continuous) are solved.
The initial approach taken to address this challenge involved ﬂow regime-dependent correla-
tions and regime transition criteria based on experimental data [54], as demonstrated in [113].
31Chapter 1 – Introduction
However, as highlighted in [57], this approach fails at reproducing the dynamics of developing
ﬂows, transition regimes, and inlet eﬀects. Moreover, correlations based on experimental data
inherently suﬀer from a considerable margin of errors, limitations in operational conditions and
geometries, and can introduce artiﬁcial discontinuities and numerical instability. To overcome
these limitations, the ﬁrst family of models introduced algebraic blending techniques for inter-
mediate regimes. One inherent weakness of the blending approach is its inability to accurately
deﬁne the gradual transitions between diﬀerent two-phase regimes.[102, 29, 142]. According to
Frederix et al. [27], the success of the transitions in GEMMA approach [102] is dependent on
capturing the dynamics on the computational grid. Indeed, most algebraic models suﬀer from
implicit transitions that only take into account the void fraction dependency, disregarding other
important factors.
The second family, known as the "multi-ﬁeld" method, divides the gas ﬁeld into N subﬁelds
based on the size distribution of the gas bubbles being computed [60, 43, 80]. For each gas ﬁeld,
an additional set of conservative equations needs to be solved. While this leads to a signiﬁcant
increase in the number of interfacial terms that need to be modeled, it allows for a more accurate
treatment of diﬀerent ﬂow regimes. The "multi-ﬁeld" family of models has gained popularity
due to its ability to handle dynamics associated with bubbles of diﬀerent shapes and bubble
interactions. Many models in the literature, such as GENTOP [43] or HD-LIS [82], are based
on combinations of the inhomogeneous MUlti-SIze Group (I-MUSIG) method [58] and a contin-
uous gas ﬁeld with an interface segregation method. One notable weakness of these models is
their high dependence on the computational grid, primarily caused by the transition condition
between the dispersed and continuous gas ﬁelds. The accuracy and performance of these models
are signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the way the transition is handled on the grid. It prevents to have
a convincing grid convergence for mesh sensitivity study, as illustrated in 1.17. Furthermore, it
prevents correct validation of some mesh progression strategies like in boundary layers or around
complex geometries. It makes the models not suitable for speciﬁc turbulent models.
The model handled in this thesis belongs to the same family of models lastly discussed but
introduces a diﬀerent approach. It relies on diﬀerential equations for the interfacial area con-
centration (IATE) [55] for two groups of bubbles, along with an interface detection method. A
detailed description of this model is presented in the following section.
1.3.2 The Two-phase RegIme Transition model
The TRITON (Two-phase RegIme TransitiON) model , developed by Kuidjo [60], combines a
two-group IATE with an interface detection method developed by Coste [16]. In this approach,
each of the two gas groups has separate momentum equations, and only the mean level of
each group is computed. The transition between the dispersed and continuous gas ﬁelds is
then determined based on the prediction of local void fraction and its gradient, enabling the
identiﬁcationofgaspockets. Onenotableadvantageofthismodelisthatitisnotgrid-dependent
in its formulation, making it well-suited for mesh progression strategies such as those used in
boundary layers. By dividing the gas into two distinct ﬁelds, we are able to eﬀectively model
separately and take into account with their unique characteristics and behavior the following
regimes topologies :
mDispersed bubbly ﬂows with one distribution of small bubbles.
mTransitional ﬂows such as cap and churn ﬂows, thanks to a hybrid large bubble dispersed-
continuous ﬁeld.

By solving the IATE, there is no need for an algebraic blending function to deﬁne the
interfacial transfer terms for the intermittent regimes, as the IATE 2-Groups model [121] already

whereσis the surface tension, gis the gravitational acceleration and ∆ρis the diﬀerence be-
tween the liquid and gas densities.
Wang and Sun tested a two-group IATE model in 3D conﬁgurations on a wide range of con-
ditions for bubbly ﬂows, in [140], and for cap-bubbly ﬂows, in [141], in channel geometry and
obtained good results.
From intermittent to separated: the LIM is an interface-holding method that identiﬁes re-
gions where the gas must be computed as a continuous phase based on a criterion deﬁned by the
volume fraction gradient[16, 17, 18]. Unlike interface tracking methods [8] (VOF [39] etc.), the
LIM does not reproduce the interface but only identiﬁes cells where interfacial forces (speciﬁc to
this regime) are applied. It is based on a three cells recognition, activated with criteria based on
the void fraction gradient that clearly identiﬁes the liquid continuous side, the gas continuous
side and an intermediate interface cell as presented in Figure 1.19.
Figure 1.19: Graphical concept of the LIM method from [16].
However, the model was designed mathematically for channel ﬂows and was validated on
few test cases. In order to reproduce the FSI problem, these types of models must undergo a
double validation necessary on the one hand to estimate the ability of the model to reproduce
the hydrodynamics of the ﬂow and the interactions between bubbles and on the other hand
to estimate the ability of the model to reproduce the good ﬂuctuations on tubes. Indeed, to
reproduce the ﬂows occurring in DIVA it is necessary to understand and validate the diﬀerent
modeling bricks but also for the interaction aspect with the structure and the turbulence. In
particular, it is necessary to further investigate in order to correctly couple the TRITON model
with the modeling of the ﬂuctuations.

1.4 The challenge of two-phase ﬂuid-stucture interaction simu-
lations
TheexperimentalsetupknownasDIVA,hostedatCEA,isdedicatedtoreplicatingandstudying
the ﬂuctuations experienced by tubes in steam generators. Its primary objective is to develop
models that can eﬀectively prevent tube ruptures. However, due to the intricate nature of
two-phase ﬂow and the limited availability of instrumentation, it is necessary to incorporate
additional local information through numerical simulations. Although several numerical ap-
proaches have been proposed in the literature, their validation, particularly under conditions
of high void fraction, is not yet convincing. One promising model, called TRITON, is based
on experimental observations and aims to simulate various ﬂow regimes encountered in a steam
generator. However, further validation and modeling are essential to accurately reproduce the
ﬂuctuations observed in two-phase ﬂow.
Theprimaryobjectivesofthisstudyaretoaddressthefollowingquestions: Howcanwereplicate
DIVA, and to what extent? What insights can we gain from simulations to enhance our under-
standing of DIVA? What kind of modeling is necessary to reproduce two-phase ﬂuid-structure
interaction? How can we eﬀectively manage areas with a high void fraction?
By answering these questions, this work aims to contribute to the advancement of understanding
and modeling of FSI in the context of two-phase ﬂow, particularly in scenarios similar to the
DIVA experimental setup.
Figure 1.20 provides an overview of the key decomposition of the DIVA experiment. In
this thesis, we investigate a ﬂuid-structure interaction problem, which involves the interaction
between a two-phase ﬂuid and a structure. However, for the purpose of this research, our focus
will be only on the ﬂuid aspect with ﬁxed tubes. Prior to simulating the movements of the
structure, it is crucial to validate the behavior of the ﬂuid and the forces exerted on the tube.
This will be achieved by reproducing the force spectra, ensuring accurate representation and
understanding of the ﬂuid dynamics. We simulate, via the NEPTUNE_CFD code, the diﬀerent
ﬂow regimes that can be observed in the DIVA analytical setup. In particular, we want to
reproduce the mechanical loading on the tubes in order to analyse and understand the observed
vibratory phenomena.
Bestion demonstrates in [3] that developing an "all-regimes" ﬂuid model for DIVA confronts
several challenges, even from a theoretical perspective. These challenges arise from the need
for accurate modeling of various physical processes within the averaged equations of the two-
phase ﬂow, as depicted in Figure 1.20. The behavior of bubbles dispersion, large interfaces,
and turbulence play crucial roles in the model. To address these processes, the TRITON model
incorporates coupling forces and IATE for the dispersed aspect, a turbulence model, and the
LIM transition for the large interfaces. Extensive work has been carried out to select and adapt
the diﬀerent components of the model. Initially developed for channel ﬂow, only a limited
literature addresses the particular challenges and modiﬁcations required to accurately replicate
the dynamic behavior of a two-phase averaged ﬂow around tubes.
The interdependencies among the various building blocks of the model is one key problem.
The accuracy of each fundamental aspect’s prediction is essential because the computations of
these aspects rely on the predictions of each other, as depicted on Figure 1.21. Therefore, any
shortcomings in predicting one fundamental aspect can have a prejudicial eﬀect on the overall
predictive capability of the model.
Best practices for two-phase ﬂow modeling in nuclear reactor thermal hydraulics are out-
lined in [2]. These practices involve identifying important ﬂow processes, such as regime type,

eling choices should be made and justiﬁed especially for the interface treatment. Closure laws
should be selected, justifying the modeling of interfacial transfers, turbulence. Coherence and
consistency of choices should be veriﬁed and compared with literature and experimental data for
simple cases. The model should be validated using more complex experimental data or down-
scaling comparisons. Finally, uncertainties in predictions should be evaluated, but will not be

2.1 The two-phase averaged Navier-Stokes equations
2.1.1 Averaging the Navier-Stokes equations
The simulation of an adiabatic system of incompressible water-air requires the computation of
the instantaneous local Navier-Stokes equations in each phase k. The conservation equations
for mass in each phase is given by :

Equations 2.1 and 2.2 are deﬁned within each phase, but it is necessary to introduce jump
conditions on either side of the interface, which is the boundary between the two phases (see [85]
for more details). From the balance equations, boundary and jump conditions, and constitutive
laws, emerge dimensionless numbers that are crucial scaling parameters. These dimensionless
numbers play a signiﬁcant role in establishing the similarity between simulations and exper-
iments. However, ﬁxing these scaling parameters in two-phase ﬂow rises a challenge due to
the inherent complexity of the system. Nonetheless, they are still used to account for speciﬁc
eﬀects within the equations. In fact, in certain conﬁgurations, scaling eﬀects can be notably
signiﬁcant, emphasizing the need to extrapolate using physical similarities. Furthermore, the
use of dimensionless parameters enables a deeper understanding of ﬂow regimes, structures,
and mechanisms. Considering an isothermal incompressible gas-liquid channel ﬂow allows us to
deﬁne several essential dimensionless numbers, presented in Table 2.1, based on the following
independent physical quantities :
mThe velocities of the liquid Uland gas phases Ug.
mThe dynamic viscosities of the liquid µland gas phases µg.
mThe densities of the liquid ρland gas phases ρg.
mThe characteristic lengths for the liquid Dland gas phases Dg. They are commonly chosen
as the hydraulic diameter for the liquid phase and the bubble diameter for bubbly ﬂow.
mThe surface tension σ.
mThe gravitational acceleration g.
The similarity between simulations also relies on operating conditions known as inlet condi-
tions for the simulation. It leans on key dimensional and non dimensional parameters that are
in Table 2.2. They are characterized by the mass ﬂow rates ˙mof the liquid ˙mland the gas ˙mg,
volumetric ﬂow rates ˙Qof the liquid ˙Qland the gas ˙Qg, the cross-sectional area Asoccupied by
the liquid and the gas and the velocities of the liquid vland the gas vg.

In the case of a system like DIVA, simulating thousands of deformable bubbles of diﬀerent
sizes and shapes while tracking their interface through the bundle of tubes with very ﬁne mesh to
capture the ﬂuctuations would be necessary. However, due to the computational power required,
it is unrealistic to be able to compute the spectra of forces exerted on tubes with our current
means. Then, it becomes necessary to consider a statistical ﬂow to reproduce the water-air ﬂow
at a low cost. To ease the understanding of the averaging principles, the formalism of Ishii and
Hibiki [85] is adopted. The general form of the Navier-Stokes equations can then be written, as
follows, to describe how a speciﬁc quantity, denoted as φkchanges:

Table 2.3 provides the corresponding quantities for the mass (equation 2.1) and momentum
conservation (equation 2.2).
The averaged Navier-Stokes equations predict the average behavior of ﬂuid motion and prop-
erties by ﬁltering out local instant ﬂuctuations. However, precise modeling of all microscopic
scales is still necessary for an accurate reproduction of the averaged ﬂow. To handle multiple
phases within the averaged framework, it becomes essential to introduce a variable that deﬁnes
the phase mixture. Let χphase
kbe a tracer of phase k, which deﬁnes whether or not we are in
this phase. It takes the value 1 if we are in the phase, 0 otherwise. The void fraction of phase

As depicted in Figure 2.1, the void fraction primarily captures smooth periodic macroscopic
phenomena. However, it can also account for interacting phenomena and disequilibrium. For
instance, to accurately depict the overall spreading phenomenon resulting from dynamic be-
havior, it becomes essential to consider the wake’s disequilibrium behind the tube, depicted in
red. Similarly, we can draw parallels to Monet’s painting approach. By observing and gathering
information daily, he performs an ensemble average to convey the comprehensive impression of
the phenomenon he wishes to represent. Given his continuous observations, he captures the
ﬂuctuating behavior and its macroscopic consequences, such as the breaking waves inﬂuenced
by their interactions with the sand.

The volume averaged method introduces two diﬀerent mean quantities for a property φ: the
mean of a ﬁeld kin the volume ¯φkand the mean of a ﬁeld in its proper volume φk. With the
42Chapter 2 – Two-phase averaged modeling for ﬂows in tubular geometries

To ensure accuracy, the mean values must satisfy a fundamental assumption of regularity, which
ensures that the average of a mean value remains consistent with the mean value itself. In order
to account for the zero mean value of the ﬂuctuation φ/prime, another commonly used approach is
the Favre averaging. The Favre average of the quantity φfor the ﬁeld kis deﬁned as ˜φk=ρφk
¯ρ,
where the overline represents the averaging operation.
A new fundamental relation arises by summing the diﬀerential equations of each phase to
get the diﬀerential equations for the mixture. Assuming that the subscript " m" denotes the
quantity for the mixture, the relation can be expressed as follows:

Turbulent and interfacial transport.(2.7)
This relation provides the basis for separating the mixture and individual phases into distinct
sets of equations. Two approaches stem from this separation: simulating only the mixture while
modeling phase phenomena, known as the drift-ﬂux model, or simulating the behavior of each
phase while incorporating turbulent and interfacial phenomena, known as the two-ﬂuid model.
According to Ishii et al. [85], the last approach oﬀers several advantages, including the ability
to simulate segregated dynamics and non-equilibrium interactions between phases.
The diﬃculties in the averaged modeling are mainly found in the momentum conservation
equation since the mass conservation equation is almost unchanged. The momentum balance
equation of the two-ﬂuid model can be expressed as follows:

In order to accurately determine the mean values of the variables of interest, a common and
simple assumption is to consider that all interfacial quantities are equal to the corresponding
average quantities. However, this approach overlooks signiﬁcant factors such as the interfacial
pressure imbalance that contributes to drag and lift caused by the presence of bubbles, as well
as the interfacial shear stress that inﬂuences skin drag.
In order to obtain the mean values of variables of interest, we have the classical ﬁeld equa-
tions of mass and momentum for each ﬁeld. The system must be closed by adding models for:
mTurbulent stress TT
k, described in section 2.3,
mInterfacial transfers of mass Γk, described in section 2.2,
mInterfacial transfers of momentum Ik, described in section 2.2.
Before modeling exchanges between phases, it is necessary to ﬁx the number of phases to
be modeled, which then imposes the number of equations. Modeling the dynamics of two-phase
ﬂows presents signiﬁcant challenges due to the diverse range of scenarios encountered, including
steady and transient behaviors, as well as losses in homogeneity and thermal eﬀects. To ad-
dress these complexities, researchers have proposed various modeling approaches. One notable
approach is the four-ﬁelds model, initially introduced by Lahey and Drew [61]. The four-ﬁelds
model partitions the ﬂow into distinct regions, each associated with speciﬁc characteristics.
These regions include the liquid phase, bubbly phase, droplet phase, and gas phase. Within this
model, a continuous liquid ﬁeld ( lc) is managed to represent the presence of liquid, a continuous
gas ﬁeld (gc) captures the behavior of large gas pockets, a dispersed gas ﬁeld ( gd) models the
dispersed bubbles, and a dispersed liquid ﬁeld ( ld) represents the behavior of liquid droplets (as
illustrated in Figure 2.2).
While the four-ﬁelds model oﬀers a comprehensive approach to capture the complex dynamics
of two-phase ﬂows, it can be computationally intensive. This model requires the solution of
twelve balance equations, accounting for mass, momentum, and energy conservation. Addition-
ally, closure models are needed to describe the interfacial transfers and interactions between the
diﬀerent ﬁelds. Implementing the four-ﬁelds model accurately demands careful consideration
of the closure models and numerical techniques to ensure reliable predictions of the system be-
havior. To reduce the number of equations, Morel [86] proposed two degenerate four-ﬁelds to
two-ﬁelds models that combines the Two-ﬂuid and Drift-ﬂux approaches. The ﬁrst proposition
involves using two dispersed ﬁelds of bubbles carried by liquid ( bm) and droplets carried by gas
(dm), and then drifting the mixture made by the dispersed ﬁeld.
Another proposition is to use two separated ﬁelds for gas ( g) and liquid ( l), with each ﬁeld being
a hybrid of dispersed and continuous phases.

Figure 2.2: Principle of a four-ﬁeld model handling any kind of topology of interest. From [61].
The subscripts v and l refer respectivly to vapor and liquid whereas d and c denote respectivly
the dispersed and the continuous phases.
The beneﬁt is the reduction of the number of closure models to 6 balance equations. However,
these approaches have limitations, such as the inability to handle non-equilibrium physical phe-
nomena.
The most preferred approach at present is to use a Two-ﬂuid model and to neglect the droplets.
This approach uses a continuous liquid ﬁeld ( l) and a hybrid continuous-dispersed gas ﬁeld ( g),
which eliminates the need for a dispersed liquid model and reduces the number of closure models
and balance equations. However, the challenge is to ﬁnd a way to transition between dispersed
and continuous phases in any topology. To address this challenge, some models deviate from
the two-ﬁeld model and use a three-ﬁeld model with a continuous liquid ﬁeld ( lc), a dispersed
gas ﬁeld (gd), and a continuous gas ﬁeld ( gc). This approach can handle gas in any topology
but still requires some model to transition between dispersed and continuous phases.
The model used in this work is based on the last approach, where continuous gas regions arise
from large bubbles. The model uses a three-ﬁeld model with a dispersed gas ﬁeld for small bub-
bles (g1), a hybrid dispersed-continuous gas ﬁeld ( g2) to handle large bubbles and gas pockets,
and a liquid continuous ﬁeld ( l). A summary of the various approaches is presented in Table 2.4
This model aims to capture the fundamental topological interfaces observed in experimental
studies. Therefore, it is imperative to precisely model diﬀerent aspects of the system, such as
interfacial stress and turbulent stress. The upcoming section focuses on experimental obser-

vations to fully comprehend their complexity. By studying experimental data, we can better
understand and account for the dynamics associated with those terms and justify the number
of phases computed in this work.
2.1.2 A bridge between experiments and equations
In the context of a liquid-gas system, such as in a gas-liquid ﬂow, the interface behavior can be
considered dispersed due to the presence of numerous relatively small bubbles. However, the
local distribution of these bubbles can exhibit variations in shape and size. While providing a
precise classiﬁcation of interface characteristics can be challenging, it is possible to categorize
them into ﬁve general categories, oﬀering a broad understanding of their properties and behavior
:
mThe spherical bubbles that stands for small spherical bubbles.
mThe distorted bubbles that stands for almost spherical bubbles (ellipsoidal). They source
from little distortion of spherical bubbles.
mThe cap bubbles that stands for cap shaped bubbles. They source from very distorted
bubbles.
mThe Taylor bubbles are bullet shaped large bubbles. Their development is conditional on
the presence of walls.
mThe churn-turbulent bubbles are very deformed bubbles because of high intensity turbu-
lence. They can not be characterized by a speciﬁc shape because of their erratic interfacial
topology.
By increasing their inner volume, bubbles modify their interface and allow local deformations,
crossing the diﬀerent types of bubbles. This deformability can be characterized by the Eötvös
number Eo. The larger Eo is, the more the bubble is deformed. Furthermore, two bubbles can
merge or one can be divided into 2, it is the coalescence/break-up mechanism. This mechanism
is sourced by random collision, wake entrainment or turbulent impact. Then, it becomes more
diﬃcult to link their diameter with their interfacial surface with a simple expression. However,
thanks to their topology, it is possible to characterised them by equivalent spherical bubble
46Chapter 2 – Two-phase averaged modeling for ﬂows in tubular geometries
diameter that represents a spherical bubble of equivalent volume. As for the volume, an equiva-
lent surface can be deﬁned to represent the surface of the interface. While the minimum bubble
diameter depends on injection conditions and turbulent intensity, the diﬀerent categories can be
segregated by maximum size/shape. To this end, Ishii and Zuber [84] proposed some bubbles
size limit:
mFor the distorted bubbles, the upper diameter limit Dldbefore becoming cap-shaped:
Dld= 4/radicalBigσ
g∆ρ, with ∆ρ=ρl−ρg. In normal conditions, Dld= 11mm. It corresponds to
Eo= 15.77.

Dlc= 11cm. It corresponds to Eo= 1.57×103.

[155].
The maximum stable Taylor bubble diameter imposes an upper limit on the bubble sizes. Con-
ﬁgurations that have a diameter D∗
H=DH/radicalbigσ
g∆ρ>40are considered "large" because no Taylor
bubble can exist. This limit segregates "small" conﬁgurations" from "large" one. In large diam-
eter conﬁgurations, small and large bubbles can coexist easily and create stronger turbulence.
This turbulence enhances the mixture diﬀusion [122], can reduce the wall-peak [152], increase
the bubble breakup. Furthermore, according to Smith and al. [121] the injection conditions can
have strong eﬀects on the ﬂow pattern by creating already deformed bubbles at the inlet.
According to Shen and al.[115], in "large" diameter pipes a core-peak phase distribution pattern
exits in most ﬂow regimes and can be linked to the presence of large and deformed bubbles. On
another hand, wall-peak distribution is met only for undisturbed bubbly ﬂow or mostly one-
dimensional ﬂows. Indeed, the lift force acts on bubbles that moves in a shear ﬂow with radial
velocity gradient at low gas superﬁcial velocity, creating a wall-peak. Furthermore, in upward
ﬂows, the average bubble size along the vertical axe increases due to the change of regime. Ac-
cording to Shawkat and al.[110], in large diameter pipes, the average liquid velocity proﬁle is
47Chapter 2 – Two-phase averaged modeling for ﬂows in tubular geometries
more uniform than in single phase ﬂow for wall-peak void fraction conﬁgurations whereas higher
average velocities can be met in core-peak void fraction conﬁguration. Furthermore, in [111],
Shawkat and al. stand that the distribution of turbulence in bubbly ﬂows is similar to that in
single-phase ﬂow but with a more uniform distribution in the core region, clue of a decrease
of the turbulent diﬀusion in this region. However, in the near wall region, the intensity was
found to be much higher than in single-phase. It is also essential to notice that a turbulence
suppression process was observed for void fraction less than 5%and for liquid velocities above
1m/s in the core.
In experimental studies the access to local information is limited. With the development of
special probes conﬁgurations local ﬂow characterization is increasingly accessible and compar-
isons with numerical simulation are becoming possible. Indeed for example with the four-sensor
optical probe, that consists of one front optical sensor and three rear optical sensors allows
getting good local information of the interfacial concentration. However, data is still very local.
The probes can give the information of the presence of the bubbles, their time residence, their
chord or their velocity.
The ﬁgures 2.4 and 2.5 are probe visualizations for diﬀerent ﬂow regimes in downward ﬂow.

It highlights noticeable diﬀerences between bubbles according to their shape or even for gas
pockets. Those diﬀerences must be included in the model in order to capture "all-regimes" ﬂow.
Indeed, depending on the topology of the ﬂow it can be homogeneous, heterogeneous, intermit-
tent, quasi-static. However, the statistical approach erases the interfacial information so that
the model by itself needs to include sources able to reproduce those very diﬀerent conﬁgurations.
The ﬁgure 2.6 shows the diﬀerent time signals of the void fraction for diﬀerent regimes. It

al. [105].
highlights that in order to get a complete description of cap-bubbly and churn turbulent ﬂows,
intermittencymustbereproducedbythemodel. Thenunsteadinessfromquasi-periodicphenom-
ena must be taken into account. In particular, Churn-turbulent ﬂows depends on unsteadiness
and turbulence. Then unsteady average equations are necessary to capture this regime.

The ﬁrst subﬁgure illustrates the distribution of the diﬀerent ﬂow conditions with a 2mm bin
for the bubbly and cap-bubbly regimes. The two other subﬁgures illustrate a zoom of the ﬁrst
subﬁgure respectively for the cap-bubbly and bubbly regimes. The bottom subﬁgure shows that
in bubbly ﬂows, any bubble is smaller than 10mm, agreeing with the bubble limit of distorted
bubbles and displays only one peak. In the top subﬁgure showing the cap-bubbly ﬂows, the
distribution displays two peaks, one around 3mm and another one around 4−8cmwhereas in
between few bubbles are detected. It highlights a transition region between two distinct "groups"
of bubbles. The small bubbles group and the large bubbles group. Furthermore, for this regime
the small bubbles’ distribution is wider than for the bubbly regime. It is due to the interactions
between the two groups of bubbles. Then the model needs to capture the behavior of the two
"groups" of bubbles and their interactions.
We have just presented the general averaged two-phase modeling for steam generator-type
ﬂows, highlighting the presence of two groups of bubbles and a ﬁeld designed to replicate erratic,
unsteady structures. However, the method of averages needs the inclusion of closure models to
faithfully reproduce the encountered structures. To achieve this, two major families of closures
must be studied: turbulent stresses ( TT
k) and interfacial models ( ΓkandIk). The following two
sections deals with these two aspects.
2.2 Modeling of the interfacial transfers
2.2.1 Interfacial momentum transfers
As a reminder, the TRITON (Two-phase RegIme TransitiON) model handles two gas groups
with separate momentum equations, and only the mean level of each group is computed. The
transition between the dispersed and continuous gas ﬁelds is then determined based on the pre-
diction of local void fraction and its gradient, enabling the identiﬁcation of gas pockets thanks
to the LIM. We ﬁnally get three ﬁelds as presented in Figure 1.18 :
mOne dispersed ﬁeld of small bubbles - less than 10.8mm.
mOne hybrid ﬁeld of bigger dispersed bubble - more than 10.8mm - and continuous ﬁeld.
mOne continuous liquid ﬁeld.
Indeed, the dispersed approach proved to be inadequate when dealing with irregular interfaces.
Interfaces that are signiﬁcantly large and cannot be considered similar to a bubble present
challenges for dispersed methods, and relying on averaging alone is insuﬃcient to address them.
To accurately capture the behavior of these interfaces and accurately simulate their interactions
with the liquid ﬁeld, a new method that incorporates an additional skin drag force is necessary.
Various methods are based on a shared principle: initially, an interface detection method is
managed to identify the location of the interface. This can be achieved through techniques such
as Volume of Fluid (VoF [39]) methods, the use of blending functions, or other deﬁned criteria.
The LIM (Large Interface Model) method [16, 17, 18], for example, is based on detecting volume
fraction gradients. In some cases, the interface detection method is coupled with an interface
sharpening technique involving interface compression or blending functions. Subsequently, a
speciﬁc drag model is handled, and some methods even incorporate surface tension eﬀects.
These approaches aim to enhance the accuracy of simulations by considering the characteristics
50Chapter 2 – Two-phase averaged modeling for ﬂows in tubular geometries
of the interface and its dynamic behavior. Regarding the LIM method, the idea is to model the
skin drag ILIMin the normal direction nto the large interface using the classical drag force FD
and in the tangential direction tusing a friction model Ffthat is speciﬁc to large interfaces.
The underlying hypothesis is that the interface behaves like a moving wall.

Interfacial dispersion force. (2.15)
Two types of hydrodynamical forces Fare classically used : the steady forces like the Drag and
the Lift and the transient forces like the Added mass forces. The interfacial dispersion forces
can be seen as transient forces because it tries to reproduce the spread by ﬂuctuations of the
steady forces. As suggested in [85], the simplest way to model the momentum transfer between
the gas and the liquid Il→gis to express them as a linear combination of several forces Fk
l→g.
The momentum transfers are then proportional to the void fraction αgand the representative

Drag force
The standard drag force FD
l→gaccounts for the form drag and the viscous friction. The model
developed by Ishii and Zuber [84] was determined with single bubble ﬂow of diﬀerent shapes and
has a strong eﬀect on terminal velocities. However, the model doesn’t seem to capture transient
bubble deformation, contamination or swarm eﬀect. This term stands for the force that goes
51Chapter 2 – Two-phase averaged modeling for ﬂows in tubular geometries
against the movement of bubbles in the ﬂow direction. It is expressed as :
FD

withai=6αg
Dsmthe interfacial area concentration of the gas, Dsmthe Sauter mean diameter and
CDthe drag coeﬃcient. This drag coeﬃcient depends on the type of bubble. For ellipsoidal
bubbles the coeﬃcient is CD=min(CDellipse,CDcap)with :

For cap and churn bubbles, the drag coeﬃcient is calculated as follows:
CDcap =8

Figure 2.8 illustrates the behavior of the two previous drag coeﬃcients, for an ellipsoidal bubble
of4mm and a cap bubble.
The previous correlations are correct in turbulent regions where Reb>1000, then in viscous
regions another correlation must be used. For low velocity area like behind cylinders and in the
near-wall region, another drag coeﬃcient can be used:

Other models were proposed to take into account the shear induced[68], the bubble defor-
mation [99] or even swarm eﬀects [76]. However, those models still need validation over a wide
variety of conﬁgurations and the contribution of these complex models compared to simpler ones
is necessary to demonstrate their usefulness.
52Chapter 2 – Two-phase averaged modeling for ﬂows in tubular geometries
Added mass force
The added mass force FAM
l→gaccounts for the apparent mass from relative acceleration. This
transient force is often used to stabilize the simulation but is based on a real physical process.
The model used was developed by Zuber [90]. However, it doesn’t take into account eﬀect of
the bubble size. This term stands for the inertia of the liquid due to the bubble acceleration. It
is expressed as:
FAM
l−>g=−CAMαg1 + 2αg
1−αgρl/parenleftBigg
DUg
Dt−DUl
Dt/parenrightBigg
, (2.21)
withCAMthe added mass coeﬃcient often taken as equal to 0.5.
Lift force
The lift force FL
l→gaccounts for the relative velocity in the normal direction, developed by Au-
ton [134] with the correlation of Tomiyama [133]. Actually, the lift force is very sensitive about
bubble size and can even change of sign. The Tomiyama correlation well capture the sign change
for air-water ﬂows at ambient conditions (around 5.8mm) and so seems to be the best to use.
However, the model doesn’t seem to capture turbulence interaction, swarm eﬀect or near-wall
interaction. This term stands for the force that goes against the movement of bubble normal to
the ﬂow direction. An overview of diﬀerent models for the lift coeﬃcient is proposed in [36]. It
is expressed as :
FL
l−>g=−CLαgρl(Ug−Ul)×(∇×Ul), (2.22)
withCLthe lift coeﬃcient. In case of potential ﬂow, this coeﬃcient is equal to 1/2 (Auton,
1987). It has been empirically modeled by Tomiyama et al. (2002) as follow :

The strength of this model is that it distinguishes the transversal behavior of small and large
bubbles. It is then adapted for the all-regimes used for the two groups. Other models were
proposed to take into account the low velocities [67, 36] and wall eﬀects [68]. However, as for
the Drag force their usefulness need to be demonstrated in a wide variety of conﬁgurations.
Hayashi and al. [33] proposed an interesting new correlation for the lift coeﬃcient, gathering
several previous works and that can reproduce the negative lift. The ﬁrst assumption is based
on the calculation of Legendre standing that the lift depends on a pure lift contribution and a
drag contribution that allows the total lift to be negative :

Turbulent dispersion force
The turbulent dispersion force FT
l→gtries to model the transport of the dispersed phase by
large ﬂuid turbulent eddies. Several original models were proposed. For example, on one hand,
the complex model proposed by Simonin et al. [118] is based on Tchen‘s theory of two-phase
dispersed turbulence. On the other hand, Lopez [73] proposed a diﬀusive model with a simple
diﬀusive constant. Another interesting model was proposed by Burns[5] is based on the Favre
average of the drag force. The Generalized Turbulent Dispersion developed by J.Laviéville and
al. [64] is used because it gathers multiple already working dispersion models and so seems to
be more general. It depends on local variables that reduces the diﬀusion in the near wall-region.
However, this model is not widespread so that it still lacks of diversity in validation. It is
expressed as :

Wall lubrication force
The wall lubrication force FWL
l→gaccounts for the redistribution of the velocity in the near-wall
regions that the lift force can not take into account. Most of the models are based on the
lubrication theory. The model developed by Tomiyama [131] is used because it is the most used
and validated one. However, this model needs the information of the hydraulic diameter. To
avoid this problem a new formulation was proposed to make it cancel at a distance Dband
inspired by the wall lubrication of Lubchenko and al. This term stands for the force that repel
bubble from the wall. It is expressed as follows :

The problem with this force is that it depends on the hydraulic diameter. In case of inﬁnite
hydraulic diameter compared to the bubble size, this force still has eﬀect on long range. Simula-
tions showed that it is necessary to have a repelling force near the stagnation point of a cylinder
to prevent gas stagnation and numerical problem. Then the aim of this force is just to prevent
this phenomenon. It is then modiﬁed as follows by replacing the hydraulic diameter by twice
the mean Sauter diameter and to calibrate the force to match the inﬁnite hydraulic diameter
strength at a radius of the wall :

56Chapter 2 – Two-phase averaged modeling for ﬂows in tubular geometries
The strength of this formulation is that it allows getting a liquid lubrication on few cells in
the near wall region and doesn’t always induce a wall peak. A force that try to reproduce the
bouncing due to the presence of the wall, called Bubble-Wall Collision Force, was proposed by
Chuang and Hibiki [11]. However, it depends on a pre-factor that still needs validation over a
wide range of conﬁgurations.
Another wall lubrication force popular FR
paccounts for the bubble void fraction gradient within
a bubble. It was proposed by Lubchenko and al. [71]. It was derived for the regularization of
the turbulent dispersion force in the near-wall region. The result was compared against Liu and
Bankoﬀ database. It allows imposing a parabolic void fraction proﬁle in the near wall region. It
is expressed as follows with the use of the generalized turbulent dispersion :

The main problem with this force is that it is a static force that is not really suitable for ﬂows
around cylinder. Indeed, this force is not able to repulse the dispersion toward the stagnation
point. In case of low ﬂow rate, the pressure do not repulse the bubbles, this force neither and
so allow non-physical local stagnant high void fraction in few cells around the stagnation point.
An essential aspect of modeling the coupling forces between the liquid and gas phases is ac-
curately predicting the interfacial area concentration. Indeed some forces are proportional to the
interfacial area concentration ai(Fk
l→g∝ai) or to an equivalent diameter Dsm(Fk
l→g∝Dsm).
To tackle this challenge, it is beneﬁcial to introduce a new equation that governs the transport
of the interfacial area concentration. With this additional equation, it becomes possible to ex-
plicitly account for the transport of interfacial area concentration to get Ikand the mechanisms
of bubbles coalescence and break-up to get Γk.
2.2.2 Obtaining the Interfacial Area Transport Equation
The two-ﬂuid model, due to averaging, can’t accurately represent the volume and presence of
interfaces. To address this limitation, an alternative approach is adopted, assuming that the
two ﬂuids can be segregated into distinct roles: a continuous stage ﬂuid and a dispersed local
actor ﬂuid that can dynamically inﬂuence the stage ﬂuid. In this context, the dispersed ﬂuid
is represented as a population of bubbles with varying diameters, which serves as a topological
characteristic for the stage ﬂuid. The dispersed ﬂuid is characterized by two interconnected
attributes: a distribution of bubble diameters and the concentration of interfaces.
We can deﬁne the Sauter-Mean Diameter of the distribution fdof sizesDas :
Dsm=/integraltextfdD3dD/integraltextfdD2dD, (2.42)
the area concentration per unit of volume Aiso that in dispersed bubbly hypothesis Ai=πD2,
the interfacial area concentration ai=/integraltextfdAidVand the void fraction α. The relation between
those variables is :
Dsm=/integraltextfdD3dD/integraltextfdD2dD= 6/integraltextfdVdV/integraltextfdAidV=6α
ai. (2.43)
Then two approaches are commonly used to compute the interfacial area concentration. The
ﬁrst naive method, often called monodispersed, is to use ﬂow regime dependent correlations and
regime transition criteria based on experimental data[113]. However, this approach can not re-
produce the dynamics of developing ﬂows [57], transition regimes and inlet eﬀects. Furthermore,
57Chapter 2 – Two-phase averaged modeling for ﬂows in tubular geometries
by nature, experimental data correlations can suﬀer of high percentage of errors, are limited in
operational conditions and geometries and cause artiﬁcial discontinuities and numerical insta-
bility [35].
The second approach, often called polydispersed, is based on a diﬀerential equation for the in-
terfacial area concentration that can reproduce dynamic phenomena, eliminate discontinuities
and allow modeling of bubble mechanism. The distribution of diameters and of interfacial pres-
ence can be modelled by a Boltzmann transport equation of the distribution called population
balance equation.
Then, two approaches can be used to solve the problem of linked diameter/interfacial concen-
tration : the Method of Momentums (MoM) [150] or size-group methods [58] .
The MoM is the most mathematically elegant method. With this method the distribution fd
is discretized into classes. We can then solve the Boltzmann equation for each class and then
compute the moment associated (surface, diameter) for the equations. However, the diﬀerent
moments are convected by the same velocity whereas it has no physical meaning.
While the idea of the MoM is to transport a discrete distribution of pics, the idea behind the
size-group methods is to ﬁx the groups so that the distribution stays continuous but to transport
only the mean level. Then the distribution is discretised into ﬁxed classes so that we can deﬁne
the fraction αiand its corresponding level of each class. The diﬀerence with the MoM is that
each class has its proper velocity. Because experimental data shows diﬀerences in velocity for
speciﬁc bubbles classes, the size-group method is used. Two separated size-group methods was
proposed. One based on having an arbitrary number of groups to reproduce a distribution, re-
ferred as MUSIG of i-MUSIG [139, 20, 69] and the other reproducing the distribution thanks to
the Mean Sauter diameter referred as IATE. The generalized Interfacial Area Transport Equa-
tion (IATE) developed by Kocamustafaogullari and Ishii [55, 56] is obtained by multiplying the
number density transport equation by the particle surface area Ai, integrating over the range of
possible volumes and simplifying the terms to get a simple diﬀerential equation for the IAC (cf.
[85]). The general expression for adiabatic ﬂows with ψinternal
ja source term and ψintergroup

A particular case of the solution can be obtained if we consider two groups of bubbles. For
example, experimentally a limit can be observed between quasi-spherical and distorted bubbles.
Then we can separate the distribution of those groups into 2 distinct distributions.
From the Boltzman transport equation of the distribution function fd(Xd,ξd,t), with external
parameters Xd, internal variables χdandSdsource term:
∂fd
∂t+∇(fddXd

Then we multiply the surface area of the particle Ai, intergrate over the volume of all particles
betweenVminandVmax. Then by switching integrals and derivative in the left hand of the
equation we get for the group kof velocityU:

(2.46)

By assuming the distribution large enough we can neglect the min contribution for the ﬁrst

χdis equal to 1for a uniform distribution proﬁle. Indeed, because there is no prior determi-
nation of the form of the solution of the distribution, the easiest from to consider is a uniform
distribution. However, the intermediate sliding between the distribution is not the dominant
term. Then the complexity is assumed to arise from source terms. Although a modiﬁed form
of this term was proposed in [11], it is not suitable for implementation in our model due to the
constraint 1−χd(Dsmc
Dsm1)3>0incompatible with χd= 1.
An accurate state of the art of the progress of the IATE model for one-group [143, 34, 52, 103,
59Chapter 2 – Two-phase averaged modeling for ﬂows in tubular geometries
92, 112] and for the two-group model [35, 28, 123, 125, 48, 37] among the last decades was
proposed by Kim et al.[53]. We notice that formulations based on the Drift-ﬂux approach was
proposed for the one-group[129] and the two-groups [4] models.
During the averaging process proposed in [51] , two new terms emerged from the instantaneous
equation: a diﬀusion term and a lift term. For example, the diﬀusion term can be implemented
as :
K√
u/prime2Dsm∇ai=K/radicalBigg
2k
3Dsm∇ai, (2.54)
withKa constant equal to 1/3.
However, it is essential to note that these terms have not yet been fully validated in various
conﬁgurations [97], leading to the decision not to include them initially in the analysis.
An signiﬁcant part of those models is the sources terms. The principle to get them is to
ﬁrst model the interactions based on simple assumptions and mechanistic phenomena [124, 42,
120, 88, 107, 114, 138]. Then the model constants are calibrated and tested on a large variety
of experiments [45, 91, 23, 21]. The following section is dedicated to those source terms.

Source terms are essential to reproduce bubble mechanism. All source term models are based
on ﬁve categories of mechanism: the Random Collisions (RC), the Wake Entrainment (WE),
the Turbulent Impacts (TI), the Shearing-oﬀ (SO) and the Surface Instability (SI). The RC is a
bubble coalescence phenomenon where 2bubbles collide and merge because of a turbulent eddy
of comparable size. The WE happens when one smaller bubble is in the wake of a bigger one,
accelerates and collides it. The TI is due to turbulent eddies that break-up bubbles. The SO is
a break-up phenomenon that source from the shearing-oﬀ of cap bubbles. The SI is due to the
break-up of large bubbles due to their surface instability.
The number of processes and the dimensionless coeﬃcient can strongly diﬀer from one model to
another. This work focuses on 5models that are commonly used or available in CFD codes:
mThe Sun and al. model [124] was developed for a 2group conﬁguration with a 200×10
mm2conﬁned rectangular channel data [126]. The eﬀect of the wall is then very signiﬁ-
cant. It was performed for liquid superﬁcial velocity between 0,32and2,84m/s and gas
velocity between 0,39and2,01m/s. It deals with cap-bubbly and churn-turbulent ﬂows.
mThe Smith and al. [120] model was developed for a 2group conﬁguration with 0.102
mm and 0,152mm diameter pipes. It deals with bubbly, cap-bubbly and churn-turbulent
ﬂows[121] (see also [28, 22]).
mThe Schlegel and al. model [107] was developed for a 2group conﬁguration with large
diameter channels [106]. It deals with bubbly and cap-bubbly ﬂows. Several constitutive
relations and correlations were used to tune this model.
mThe Kuidjo model [83] was developed for a 2group conﬁguration to compute real ﬂuid dy-
namics in channel ﬂows. It uses Smith model with Sun model’s dimensionless coeﬃcients
(see appendices A.2).
60Chapter 2 – Two-phase averaged modeling for ﬂows in tubular geometries
mThe Ruyer-Seiler model [100] is a MoM model for 1 group conﬁgurations. It uses a
quadratic law for the distribution, inspired by experimental data.
The source terms used in this thesis are Kuidjo’s terms. An example of dynamics is presented
in the following ﬁgure 2.11.
Figure 2.11: Representation of 2 group bubble mechanism.
The primary mechanism for coalescence is random collisions between bubbles caused by tur-
bulent eddies. Binary collisions are modeled to simplify the expression for the source terms.
The model is based on turbulent variables and activation-like models.
The second major mechanism is the entrainment of bubbles in the wake of preceding bubbles.
The acceleration due to the wake may lead to collisions. The model is based on relative velocities
and probability of meeting.
As a mirror mechanism to random collision coalescence, the primary mechanism for break-up is
turbulent impacts due to turbulent eddies. The eddies that can lead to break-up are assumed to
have a comparable size to the bubble. Larger eddies can carry smaller bubbles without causing
break-up, and smaller eddies do not carry enough energy to induce break-up. The models are
based on turbulent variables and eﬃciency models that depend on the critical Weber number
to determine their stability with respect to break-up.
Another break-up mechanism is the shearing-oﬀ of Group 1 bubbles at the base of large cap
bubbles. In highly viscous ﬂows, cap bubbles can get thinner around their base, giving birth
to small bubbles being sheared oﬀ. The model is based on the balance between surface tension
and interfacial shear force. It includes surface tension variables and eﬃciency based on Weber
numbers.
The last break-up mechanism modeled is surface instability. When coalescence leads to a bubble
larger than the maximum stable bubble limit, the induced bubble is unstable and disintegrates.

approach for the turbulent stresses. This modeling is discussed in detail in the following section.
2.3 Modeling of the turbulent stress
2.3.1 Fundamentals of single-phase turbulence models
The turbulent stress term is derived from the process of averaging the momentum equation of
the Navier-Stokes equations. While the turbulence tends to expand the range of length scale,
the averaged approach tends to erase the smallest scales. The Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes
(RANS) simulates only the macroscopic scale and models the other scales. It is the cheapest
approach in terms of computational power, but it needs a high proportion of model to get com-
plex behaviors.
For simplicity, we will focus on a single-phase, incompressible problem without any external
sources. The momentum equation for this example can be expressed as follows:

In order to apprehend the averaging, we stand that the quantities viandPcan be decomposed
into a mean value Ui,¯Pand a ﬂuctuation ui,pvalue so that vi=Ui+ui.
By applying the mean to the previous equation we get :

The operating average ﬁlter preserves the fundamental structure of the instantaneous equation,
with one notable exception: the emergence of the turbulent stress term, also called Reynolds
stress, represented as uiuj. This term captures the eﬀects of turbulent ﬂuctuations that occur
within the ﬂow. Thus, it becomes crucial to compute this term to properly account for these
ﬂuctuations.
If we subtract the previous equation to the ﬁrst one, we can get the equation Eqiof the ﬂuc-
tuating velocity ui. The Reynolds stress equation can be obtained by performing the operation

This expression is an analytical equation for the Reynolds stress. However, 4non-linear terms
need models because they cannot be computed because they are not directly depending on the
Reynolds stress or the mean ﬂow. We then have 6 equations with 34 new unknowns. In order
to get rid of some terms, one idea is to consider the turbulent kinetic energy k=1

The equation reveals a fundamental propriety: both the mean and ﬂuctuating pressures depend
on the velocity ﬁeld’s values at any given point and time. It emphasizes the relevance of inves-
tigating pressure eﬀects to fully capture the proprieties of turbulence.
For industrial purposes 2 type of models are commonly used based on the previous equations.
The ﬁrst type is the ﬁrst-order models, which aim to estimate turbulence by computing the
equations for the scalars kandε. They are often referred as the k−εmodels and follow a
classical formulation, with Na model :
∂k
∂t+Ui∂k
∂xi=NDiffusion+NProduction−NDissipation+ν∂2k
∂xk∂xk. (2.62)
To close the problem the idea is to use a propriety of turbulence : creating strong inertial
ﬂows. From this observation, an isotropic homogeneous turbulence could be seen as a strong
diﬀusive phenomenon with a viscosity νt. The so-called Boussinesq relation that rely on this
hypothesis gives then :

The turbulent viscosity is then evaluated by :
νt=Cµk2
ε, (2.64)
withCµa constant often taken as equal to 0.09.
The classical formulation of the k−εmodel available in industrial codes is given in the appen-
dices A.1.
The advantage of this model is its reduced reliance on diﬀerential equations compared to
second-order models, resulting in lower CPU costs. It oﬀers ease of computation and excellent
stability. It accurately predicts shear stress in free sheared ﬂows and free ﬂows with strong
turbulence, addressing well-documented errors. However, due to its linear behavior, this model
cannoteﬀectivelycapturetheinteractionbetweenawakeandamixlayer, ﬂowswithpronounced
curvature, and boundary layers. Additionally, a signiﬁcant drawback of this model is the inher-
entpositivityoftheproductionterm, leadingtothewell-knownissueofoverestimatingturbulent
kinetic energy in boundary layers prior to a stagnation point.
The second type of model is known as the second-order model or Reynolds Stress Model
(RSM). These models directly incorporate equations for the Reynolds tensor and the dissipation
rate. One key advantage of the RSM is its ability to accurately capture nonlinear phenomena
and avoid stagnation point anomalies, thanks to an analytical production term. This term plays
acrucialroleinvariousturbulentphenomena. Forinstance, inturbulentﬂowsaroundacylinder,
it induces the redistribution of velocities from turbulence to the mean ﬂow. However, the RSM
has some limitations compared to the linear model. It is numerically less robust, meaning it may
encounter stability issues during computations. Calibration of the RSM is also more challenging
due to its nonlinear behavior, requiring more intricate adjustments and ﬁne-tuning. The general

64Chapter 2 – Two-phase averaged modeling for ﬂows in tubular geometries
In the simulation of turbulent ﬂows, the near-wall region is a crucial area that raises chal-
lenges for modeling. In this region, turbulence is weaker compared to viscosity, involving stan-
dard turbulent models failure. To address this issue, two approaches are commonly used: near-
wall laws and near-wall damping eﬀects.
The ﬁrst approach involves implementing a law that describes the behavior of velocity in the
near-wall region. It assumes the presence of a viscous boundary layer with a thickness denoted
asδfor the dimensionless distance to the wall, y+=y
δ. Typically, it is recommended to ensure
that the ﬁrst cell size in the near-wall region satisﬁes the condition of 30< y+<100, as the
model cannot be directly integrated all the way to the wall. These models are typically referred
to as High-Reynolds models. However, a signiﬁcant challenge associated with this approach is
the constraint it imposes on the ﬂuid’s behavior near the wall, and the question of its universality
for all ﬂow conﬁgurations is still a topic of debate.
The second solution involves introducing a damping function or a new term that becomes active
near the wall to dampen the turbulence in that region. This approach allows achieving y+≈1,
enabling the models to be integrated closer to the wall. Models that can be integrated all the
way to the wall are typically referred to as Low-Reynolds models.

When considering the equations of turbulence, a crucial aspect to address is the treatment
of temporal changes. The operation of averaging raises a question about the interpretation
of temporal changes when the ﬂuctuations are subjected to averaging. This particular aspect
of turbulence modeling is commonly referred to as Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes
(URANS) models, and it remains a subject of ongoing debate and discussion within the scientiﬁc
community. This approach tries to solve the instantaneous averaged Navier-Stokes equations.
Theideaisthatthestatisticaltreatmentcouldseparatescalesoflowfrequenciesandmacroscopic
eﬀects from real turbulence. In turbulent ﬂows, it is essential to acknowledge the possibility of
disequilibrium and interactions with other phases that exist outside the traditional range of fre-
quencies associated with real turbulence. This consideration becomes relevant when attempting
to reproduce low-frequency phenomena, as depicted in Figure 2.12. Consequently, the ergodic-
ity hypothesis, which states that ensemble average and temporal average are equal, is no longer
65Chapter 2 – Two-phase averaged modeling for ﬂows in tubular geometries
valid when computing URANS models at any given time. To address this issue, averaging over
time is required to restore the validity of the ergodicity hypothesis. By averaging the results
obtained from URANS simulations over a longer time period, a more representative and consis-
tent estimation of the ﬂow behavior can be achieved.
URANS can be interpreted as the application of an implicit ﬁlter, able to separate real ran-
dom ﬂuctuations from coherent structures. The main problem comes with the use of ﬁrst order
models. Indeed, they are based on equilibrium hypothesis and calibrated for stationary ﬂows.
Coherent structures can be broken by the ﬁxed equilibrium. Furthermore, those models tend to
overestimate the turbulent viscosity, blurring unsteadiness. Several solutions are possible: try-
ing to artiﬁcially reduce the turbulent viscosity (OES, that takes Cµ= 0.02), to use non-linear
models that can take into account non-equilibrium (thanks to the production term) or even to
use hybrid RANS/LES approaches.
Based on those general concepts of turbulence, we can describe the model chosen for this
work : the EBRSM [77]. A description of this model proposed on the following section.
2.3.2 The Elliptic Blending - Reynolds Stress Model
One fundamental phenomena that must be modeled is the dissipation ε. However, the equation
ofεthat can be derived from its analytical formula is way too complex and the physical inter-
pretation of all the terms is diﬃcult. Furthermore, no term is experimentally accessible only
numerical simulation can access it. For example, in the k−εmodel [47] the dissipation equation
is a standard equation with source, sink terms and a diﬀusion term. The other noticeable ex-
ample is the SSG [9] that try to model the inﬂuence of the anisotropy. Indeed, their work try to
use a linear algebraic equation from the degeneration of the transport of the pseudo-dissipation
in case of energetic equilibrium and 2Dhomogeneous velocity gradient. This way they get a
non-linear relation with the mean velocity gradient. So that it can reproduce global shear phe-
nomenon but not real anisotropy.

Unlike dissipation, the triple correlation is experimentally accessible by measuring the ﬂuc-

reason why gradient models are likely to use to capture the phenomenon. The main diﬃculty
is to preserve the tensor’s symmetry. Few errors come from the model of this term, but few

The SSG model is widely used to address ﬂuctuating pressure redistribution in turbulence.
It originated from theoretical research on the pressure-strain correlation term φij, accounting for
turbulence redistribution due to pressure ﬂuctuations. This term incorporates crucial directional
information for the Reynolds stress tensor’s oﬀ-diagonal components. The model’s development
involved invariant theory, asymptotic analysis, and calibration to establish desirable behavior
based on the anisotropy tensor. By introducing additional macroscopic variables, it enables sim-
ulation of anisotropy and ensures realistic Reynolds stress tensor predictions. The SSG model
eﬀectively predicts various phenomena like secondary ﬂows and blockage eﬀects. However, it
exhibits discrepancies in certain cases, such as non-physical phenomena near walls, leading to
its denoted term φh
ij.
Durbin [25] identiﬁed that the near-wall issues associated with second-order turbulence models
are due to the assumptions of locality and quasi-homogeneity. Near the wall, non-viscous and
non-local phenomena, such as the "wall echo" eﬀect and the blocking eﬀect, signiﬁcantly aﬀect
the ﬂow. To address this, Durbin proposed introducing non-locality artiﬁcially by assuming an
exponential decrease in correlations between points. This modiﬁcation aims to capture the inﬂu-
ence of signiﬁcant small-scale ﬂuctuations on the ﬂow. By incorporating this non-local behavior,
Durbin aims to improve the accuracy of turbulence models near the wall and better account for
the complexities of near-wall ﬂows. This hypothesis then leads to the elliptic relaxation equation

withφha quasi-homogeneous valid model and L representing a correlation length.
In the near-wall region, certain terms such as viscous diﬀusion, dissipation ε, and velocity-
pressure gradient correlation φplay dominant roles. However, these terms require further mod-
eling for accurate representation. Regarding the velocity-pressure gradient correlation, Manceau
[78] proposed to establish a transition between an asymptotically valid model, denoted as φw,
based on invariant theory, and a quasi-homogeneous valid model, denoted as φh, which incorpo-
rates an algebraic expression and a one-component diﬀerential equation inspired by the elliptic
relaxation from R. Manceau’s thesis. This transition is designed to ensure the appropriate be-
havior of the velocity-pressure gradient correlation. To address the issue of singularity at the
wall and improve the behavior of dissipation ε, a new equation was proposed. The objective
was to signiﬁcantly reduce the number of additional equations, enhance numerical stability, and
maintain the desirable properties of the elliptic relaxation approach. Subsequently, the EBRSM
(Elliptic Blending Reynolds Stress Model) [77] was further developed based on theoretical argu-
ments from invariant theory and extensive comparison with DNS data. The near-wall behavior
is then computed as:

The wall boundary conditions are then : Ui= 0,Rij= 0andβ = 0. One of the strength of this
model is also to constrain the behavior of the dissipation to the wall to get the right behavior :
ε= 2νlim
y→0k
y2.
The choice of EBRSM is motivated by its demonstrated performance in handling complex
ﬂow conﬁgurations and accurately predicting near-wall phenomena. Indeed, traditional models
like the SSG model are insuﬃcient in reproducing the dynamics near the wall, often resulting
in non-physical velocities in that region [30]. This limitation is commonly observed in High-
Reynolds models.
In single-phase ﬂows, the EBRSM model has been demonstrated to perform well for bundle ge-
ometries, as shown by Benhamadouche et al. [1]. This model eﬀectively captures the near-wall
behavior, pressure losses, mean velocity, and velocity ﬂuctuations (r.m.s. levels). The study
also highlighted the limitations of other Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models in
developing unsteadiness, which was attributed to an overestimation of diﬀusion in the wake
region. In comparison, the EBRSM model exhibited promising results, with some conﬁgura-
tions showing comparable performance to Large Eddy Simulation (LES). This suggests that
the EBRSM has potential for studying ﬂuid-structure interaction, making it a valuable tool in
such analyses. The validation of the EBRSM in two-phase ﬂows was carried out by Colombo
et al. [15] against various air-water ﬂows using both a monodispersed model and a pseudo-
turbulence model. The validation database included upward and downward pipe ﬂows, large
diameter pipes, and square duct ﬂows with void fractions up to 0.15%. The results demon-
strated a good agreement between the EBRSM predictions and experimental data. Notably,
the accuracy of near-wall pressure gradients obtained using elliptic blending eliminated the need
for wall-lubrication techniques. However, the observations regarding wall-lubrication should be
further examined in the context of polydispersion and tubes to conﬁrm their applicability in a
broader range of conﬁgurations.
The EBRSM is a single phase turbulent model. However, in a two-phase ﬂow, the inter-
mittence of bubbles in the liquid phase induces ﬂuctuations that are not reproduced in the
single-phase turbulent model. The next section is then about the model of two-phase turbulence
induced by bubbles.
2.3.3 Two-phase pseudo-turbulence
Although there is no universally optimal approach for every single-phase conﬁguration, extensive
research conducted over the years has yielded well-known models that are recognized for their
strengths and weaknesses, along with established best practices for their application. However,
when it comes to two-phase ﬂows, the situation is more complex. Purely two-phase turbulence
models have been found to perform poorly in terms of validation and have even generated sig-
niﬁcant controversy. In reality, due to the diﬀerence in density between gas and water, the
turbulence induced by the presence of gas is typically insigniﬁcant in the majority of industrial
68Chapter 2 – Two-phase averaged modeling for ﬂows in tubular geometries
test cases. Consequently, it is often disregarded. However, the ﬂuctuations caused by the bub-
bles in the liquid phase cannot be overlooked or neglected. These ﬂuctuations play a crucial role
in the behavior of two-phase ﬂows and require careful consideration in modeling and analysis.
For example, in a single phase channel ﬂow the intensity is often between 5%and8%. However,
in two-phase ﬂows the intensity can be much higher [154, 116]. Indeed for void fraction between
0and0.2(i.e. bubbly ﬂows), the intensity can go from 5%to around 10%. For transitional ﬂows
of void fraction between 0.2and0.3, the intensity can go from 10%to17%. For intermittent
ﬂows of void fraction between 0.3and0.6, the intensity at the center is around 17%and near
the wall can go from 20%to more than 60%du to the high intermittency of churn bubbles. An
interesting experimental description of what are the agitation, mixing, and transfers induced by
bubbles was proposed by Risso [98] and is suggested for deeper understanding of the phenomena.
According to Lucas and al. [72], the eﬀects of bubble induced turbulence has nothing to do with
real turbulence. The ﬂuctuations induced by bubble wakes and relative velocity can not be
related to turbulence. It is why it is often called pseudo-turbulence. Actually, the "additional"
level of energy due to these phenomena is supposed to be taken into account by the hydrody-
namic forces previously introduced. However, it is interesting to mention that it exists some
work about models for Bubble Induced Turbulence (BIT) combined with Shear Induced Tur-
bulence (SIT). It supposes that the total turbulent shear stress is the superposition of classical
turbulent shear-stress and bubble induced turbulence. The phenomena that are supposed to be
simulated had been identiﬁed by Lance and al [62]:
mThe turbulent kinetic energy increase due to the relative motion of liquid and gas
mThe shear induced turbulence due to the wake of the bubbles
mThe turbulence damping due to the deformation of bubbles

about BIT. A scale up attempt from DNS results had also been done by Du Cluzeau [12] for
a decomposition of BIT into Wake Induced Fluctuations (WIF) and Wake Induced Turbulence
(WIT) in order to justify the use of this approach. While the WIF takes into account "laminar"
ﬂuctuating eﬀects due to a relative velocity change around a bubble, the WIT try to take into
account the ﬂuctuating eﬀects due to the wake of bubbles. However, those approaches still lack
of diverse cases of validation and adapted/established near-wall methods for two-phase near-wall
regions. Furthermore, a criticism can be made about the "laminar" part that is diagonal, only
adding energy in the ﬂow but introducing no redistribution by the ﬂuctuation. Then the frontier
between this part and the drag force seems to blur. Nonetheless, several attempts of combining
turbulenceandpseudo-turbulencewereproposedformultipletestcases[15,13,14,74,75]among
the last years. However, the pure contribution of pseudo-turbulence is not clearly demonstrated.
The model used in this work was developed by [81] and is called the Large Inclusions model
(LI). It adds a production term linked to the bubble drag in the Reynolds tensor equation and
a source term in the dissipation’s equation as given hereafter :

The main advantage of this model is that it follows the streamwise direction and so needs no

2.4 Simulations before modiﬁcations
In the literature, various conﬁgurations of channel ﬂows have been investigated using the models
previously introduced [24, 26, 59, 145, 140, 87, 41, 96, 149, 141, 40, 10, 11, 38]. Notably,
in the context of vertical upward two-phase ﬂows, an insightful review of CFD models and
corresponding experiments was conducted in [10]. In order to apprehend brieﬂy the singular
eﬀect of the interfacial transport, the BIT, the turbulence and the presence of an obstacle, we
propose in Table 2.6 some of the most recent signiﬁcant CFD studies conducted for bubbly ﬂows.

Despite the extensive research in the ﬁeld of upward two-phase ﬂow, the literature reveals a
notable absence of signiﬁcant CFD studies using an ’all regimes’ model or even models handling
IATE or MUSIG for ﬂows around a cylinder. Some applications of two-phase models around
obstacles are available in [142] but lacks of experimental confrontation. This lack of relevant
investigations highlights a crucial research gap, indicating the need for further exploration and
application of such advanced CFD approaches in the context of two-phase ﬂow phenomena
around cylinders.
2.4.1 Description of the experiment and numerical model
A platform hosted at CEA is dedicated to the study of two-phase ﬂows around a unique cylinder.
The loop pump is able to deliver 5to300L/sof water and an air compressor able to deliver up
to3000m3/hat an absolute pressure of 8bar. The loop can thus function in water ﬂow, air ﬂow
or water-to-air ﬂow. It allows reproducing regimes similar to the ones encountered in the SG
70Chapter 2 – Two-phase averaged modeling for ﬂows in tubular geometries
and DIVA. The experimental setup is composed of an upward channel of 0.18×0.3m2rectangu-
lar section in which can be set an horizontal tube of diameter 0.03mas presented in Figure 2.13.
The Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the ﬂuid force (drag and lift directions) acting on the
tube is measured for various volume ﬂow rates of air and water. The nature of the forces exerted
on the tube can be identiﬁed by the balance equations and summing for any phase and over
the cylinder surface. Then, according to the equations, the force Fis due to the distribution of
pressureParound the tube of oriented surface ds, to the distribution of the viscous stress τ, as
follows:
F=−/contintegraldisplay

Regarding the spectral analysis, because the simulation and the experiment signals are tem-
porally discrete a special treatment must be used. A random signal can yield diﬀerent results
depending on the analysis intervals. In order to characterize the random force signal, it is es-
sential to get the frequency range occupied by the signal. To understand the force spectra, we
need to remind the deﬁnition of the cross-correlation s2s2between two signals, denoted as s1
ands2, of delayτ, over time T:
s2s2(τ) = lim
T→+∞1
T/integraldisplayτ

:
<s1,s2>(f) =/integraldisplay∞
−∞s1s2(τ)e−i2πfτdτ (2.75)
The auto-spectrum <s,s> is also known as the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the signal s.
It allows us to measure the distribution of power along the frequency axis.
To ensure meaningful data comparison, it is essential that the simulated signal and the ex-
perimental signal share identical temporal discretization, along with consistent post-processing
methods. This is crucial because spectral analysis is highly sensitive to both the temporal time
step and signal post-processing techniques.
One crucial aspect of the simulation involves creating a mesh that is speciﬁcally designed to
address the problem. This is particularly crucial in the case of Neptune_CFD, which speciﬁcally
uses hexahedral meshes for stability reasons and to accurately model systems that are sensitive
to volume distortion. SALOME [128], an open-source software that provides a generic pre- and
post-processing platform for numerical simulation, was used to generate the diﬀerent meshes.
To achieve this, it is recommended to handle a mesh strategy that incorporates the following
features presented in Figure 2.13. The mesh should incorporate a boundary layer that expands
rapidly. This expansion is limited in space to ensure accurate representation of the boundary
layer phenomenon. The boundary layer region of the cylinder needs to be reﬁned extensively.
This is because the boundary layer plays a signiﬁcant role in generating the mixing layer and Von
Karman instabilities, which are important phenomena to capture accurately in the simulation.

In this section, we aim to highlight the challenges encountered in modeling a case involving
a single cylinder, which is representative of the diﬃculties associated with the presence of an
obstacle. Our goal is to demonstrate the results of a two-phase model without modiﬁcations,
as it existed prior to the start of this thesis. Despite the model’s validation in various channel
conﬁgurations, we wish to emphasize that the presence of the obstacle introduces a unique ﬂow
topology, thus questioning the accuracy of its reproduction in this context compared to the
validation in a channel. We also aim to demonstrate that the need to use slightly diﬀerent
models helps to identify problems within the models more easily, particularly within TRITON.
2.4.2 Results and analysis
In order to apprehend and understand the TRITON model, we chose to study a bubbly ﬂow
test case. The operating conditions are deﬁned by a liquid superﬁcial velocity jl= 0,25m/s
and a gas superﬁcial velocity jg= 0.082m/s. The ﬂow is then characterized by a void fraction
αg= 0.247and a liquid Reynolds Rel= 7500. A mesh convergence study was performed on
several meshes and a satisfying convergence was obtained with a general mesh size of 0.066
mm and a ﬁrst wall cell satisfying y+≈0,8. The forces selected for this study are unchanged
Ishii’s Drag, Tomiyama’s lift, Zuber’s added mass, Lavieville’s dispersion and Tomiyama’s wall
lubrication. The EBRSM is used without adding bubbles induced turbulence.
By computing the previous system of equations with TRITON model, some quantities ex-
hibited divergence, while others displayed non-physical behavior, such as an excessive increase
in velocity near the cylinder. Upon analyzing the calculations, the source of the problem seemed
not to lie in numerical aspects but rather in the modeling itself.
Close to the cylinder, numerous areas exhibit a void fraction that is on average 2to4times
higher than in the upstream region. This phenomenon is a direct result of the interaction and
modeling between the ﬂuid and the structure. These speciﬁc regions can be characterized as
dynamic, primarily because the behavior of the bubbles in those areas is spatially uncorrelated
from the bubbles present in the main ﬂow, as depicted in Figure 2.14.
73Chapter 2 – Two-phase averaged modeling for ﬂows in tubular geometries
Figure 2.14: Extract of a video of bubble trapping in a cylinder wake from the
Heat Transfer and Multiphase Flow Lab of Penn State University. Accesible at
https://www.raulab.psu.edu/cylinder-wake-modiﬁcation-in-bubbly-ﬂow/.
Indeed comparing with Figure 2.14, it becomes obvious that the presence of the cylinder in
the ﬂow induces a slowdown of the bubbles upstream, as compared to the bubbles within the
main ﬂow. This behavior subsequently leads to an increase in the averaged local void fraction
as modeled in the simulation. Additionally, the wake region created by the cylinder induces a
bubble trapping region, causing them to remain in that area for an extended period, resulting
in a signiﬁcantly higher void fraction. These areas of high void fraction, as observed in the sim-
ulation, have a physical basis directly attributed to the presence of the cylinder. Importantly,
such areas do not occur in channel ﬂows, highlighting the incompatibility of the basic model
developed for channels in capturing this phenomenon. Therefore, modiﬁcations of the model are
necessary, particularly to account for these high void fraction regions.
In order to gain a partial understanding of the root causes of these issues, another model
already available in NEPTUNE_CFD was examined. In this case, the forces and turbulence
model were retained, but the transitional aspect was removed, and the IATE equation was
replaced. Consequently, only one group remained, connected to a transport equation developed
by Ruyer-Seiler. Multiple simulations were conducted by varying injection diameters to further
explore this case.
74Chapter 2 – Two-phase averaged modeling for ﬂows in tubular geometries
Figure2.15: Time-averagedvoidfractioncolormapfromthesimulationoftwo-phaseﬂowaround
a cylinder with Ruyer-Seiler for Dsm1= 6mm.
Figure 2.15 illustrates the color map of the time-averaged void fraction of group 1obtained
from the numerical simulation, with an injected diameter of 6mm. Notably, a homogeneous
region can be observed in the upstream region, away from the cylinder, with a void fraction
approximately around 0.12. Close to the cylinder, several areas exhibit an averaged void frac-
tion that is 4times higher than the upstream void fraction, as observed in [44] and previously
illustrated.
It should be noted that qualitative information alone is insuﬃcient to accurately determine the
ﬁdelity of the model and comprehend its successes or limitations. Therefore, it becomes impera-
tive to investigate the spectrum of forces exerted on the cylinder to gain a deeper understanding
of the phenomena and assess the model’s performance at a more detailed level.
Figure2.16depictsthepowerspectraldensities(PSD)ofdragandliftexertedonthecylinder
for various injection diameters ( 1mm, 4.5mm, and 6mm), which are compared with experi-
mental data. Both 1mm and 4.5mm depict almost no noticeable ﬂuctuation for the drag and
the lift until 2Hz, then some harmonics seem to be captured with a negative slop lower than in
the experimental graphs. For the 6mm case, the lift and the drag depict an almost ﬂat curve
with one ﬂuctuation around 3.4Hz for the lift and some ﬂuctuations close to the experimental
ones for the drag. The results show signiﬁcant disparities in the drag and lift behaviors as a
function of the injection diameter. The drag spectra obtained for injection diameters of 1mm
and4.5mm exhibit more signiﬁcant deviations from the experimental results, displaying only
a characteristic frequency at St= 0.18and its corresponding echoes. In contrast, the drag
spectrum for the 6mm diameter closely resembles the experimental graph. This discrepancy
can be attributed to the excessive coalescence observed in the ﬁrst two cases compared to the 6
mm case. For instance, in the 4.5mm case, the predicted average diameter at the rear reaches
approximately 6.5mm, representing an increase of over 40%, while for the 6mm case, it is only
11%. This overestimated coalescence leads to pronounced variations in the drag model for the
bubbles, which subsequently ampliﬁes a speciﬁc frequency observed in the lift graph. While
there is optimism regarding the model’s ability to reproduce the ﬂuctuations for the drag, none
of the considered injection diameters successfully capture the experimental ﬂuctuations observed
for the lift. Only the ﬂuctuation of the wake can be observed. In one case, the bubbles belonging
to the ﬁrst group experience shearing forces from the liquid close to the wall. In the other case,
75Chapter 2 – Two-phase averaged modeling for ﬂows in tubular geometries
the bubbles cluster slightly further away from the cylinder before being sheared. This diﬀerence
in behavior arises from the interplay between the low pressure caused by bubble clustering and
the low pressure resulting from the Von Kármán alley. When the pressure behind the cylinder
exceeds the pressure resulting from bubble clustering, the clusters of bubbles move away from
the cylinder wall.

Due to the poor performance of the Ruyer-Seiler model in reproducing the observed ﬂuctu-
ations and TRITON to reproduce a ﬂow with an obstacle, it becomes necessary to introduce
modiﬁcations in order to improve the spectrum and the simulations. Modiﬁcations are neces-
sary to achieve a more precise representation of the force spectrum and of the ﬂow. To pursue
further improvements, the next section of the study focuses on investigating enhancements in
a less complex conﬁguration: channel ﬂows. As key parts of the model, the IATE, the turbu-
lence coupling, the dispersion and the transition must be studied to prevent the emergence of
problems and quantify the performances of the model.

New modeling and modiﬁcations based on
channel ﬂow investigations
This chapter aims to address the modeling challenges proposed in this thesis as-
sociated with the presence of the cylinder and the uncertainties related to turbulence.
The ﬁrst part discusses the use of turbulence models in channels by comparing
two-phase turbulent simulations with experimental data. The initial section focuses
on turbulence in a narrow rectangular channel, while the second part examines
turbulence in a large square channel.
The second part deals with the modiﬁcations introduced in the model to correct
problems related to high void fraction due to the presence of the cylinder or due to
the regime (high proportion of group 2). This part is divided into four sections. The
ﬁrst one suggests modiﬁcations to the modeling of the forces, particularly regarding
turbulent dispersion forces. The second part proposes adjustments to some source
terms to mitigate local issues in predicting interfacial area. The third part proposes
modiﬁcations to the pseudo-turbulence model to align it with existing literature.
The ﬁnal part deals with modeling the dynamics of large bubble group 2and gas
pockets. It presents various approaches used to address the simulation challenges
associated with this group.Summary
77Chapter 3 – New modeling and modiﬁcations based on channel ﬂow investigations
3.1 On the coupling with a turbulence model
3.1.1 A paradigm shift
The original concept of the model proposed in [60] is to provide a criterion for the maximum
void fraction αgmax, a maximum diameter 10Dsmcand another one based on the mesh size ∆x
for transitioning from the dispersed to the continuous model. The last criterion is widely used in
literature, although its sophistication may vary. Figure 3.1 illustrates the diﬀerence in paradigm
between all-regimes models from the literature and our model. Indeed, in models found in the
literature, the confusion between dispersed modeling (the area concentration per unit of volume
Ai=πD2, see equation 2.43) and dispersed vision regarding a mesh of sensors introduces the
reconstruction of interfaces when they are larger than the numerical grid size [102]. The use
of smoothing techniques between models becomes necessary when transitioning from dispersed
modeling to continuous interface reconstruction. In our approach, modeling is grounded in
physical considerations. Initially, we assume that the coalescence of small bubbles from Group
1 gives rise to bubbles in Group 2. Subsequently, deformed bubbles from Group 2 can emerge
as large gas pockets and extensive interfaces. This perspective arises from the natural growth
of interfaces, shifting from one category and thus, one modeling approach (Group 1 to Group
2) and ﬁnally to a continuous ﬁeld. This transition occurs when the equivalent diameter be-
comes too large, creating a large interface, or when the void fraction becomes too high, as large
bubbles have a shape that limits their arrangement, leading to the presence of an annular regime.

Furthermore, this latter criterion should be avoided, especially when investigating complex
ﬂow phenomena around a cylinder.
First, if we were able to create a homogeneous mesh, this criterion imposes limitations on pos-
sible injection velocities. For instance, in the case of a roughly converged mesh in RANS, the
78Chapter 3 – New modeling and modiﬁcations based on channel ﬂow investigations
near-wall ﬁrst cell size ∆x0should be such that ∆x0≈60νl
0.05Ulfor High-Re turbulence models,
withUlthe mean liquid velocity and νlthe liquid kinematic viscosity. Kuidjo’s criterion states
that the mesh step ∆xis so that 4∆x≥Dsm, which implies that for bubbles of the order of
a millimeter, we have Ul<800νl
0.05Dsm≈1.2m/s. For a Low-Re mesh conﬁguration like that
of EBRSM, this translates to Ul<8νl
0.05Dsm≈0.16m/s. However, in the case of the DIVA
conﬁguration (tube bundle), the presence of tubes increases the ﬂow gap velocity by a factor of
three, due to the pitch ratio, resulting in allowable injection velocities of 0.4m/s and 0.053m/s,
respectively. It would mean that the LIM is activated everywhere. This makes the EBRSM
incompatible with this criterion for a homogeneous mesh if we want to test the IATE even for
low void fractions.
Secondly, the presence of the bundle makes it nearly impossible to use a perfectly homoge-
neous mesh, as the curvature of the tubes demands cells of varying sizes. This is particularly
obvious given that NEPTUNE _CFD uses hexahedral meshes. Consequently, the dispersed-to-
continuous transitions could potentially become non-physical due to mesh-induced eﬀects. This
make the physical interpretation of the model diﬃcult.
Thirdly, the ﬁrst criterion based on a maximum void fraction relies on predicting the void
fraction, which depends on mesh accuracy. Hence, there is a risk of missing out on physical
phenomena if the mesh is too coarse.
Lastly, this criterion makes the interpretation of simulations, particularly in terms of simulation
error - a critical factor in the nuclear ﬁeld - almost impossible. Actually, the physical inter-
pretation of a simulation relies on distinguishing between discretization error from the mesh
and the intrinsic error of the model itself. However, if the criterion depends on the mesh, then
the intrinsic error of the model also becomes mesh-dependent. As a reminder, the mesh is a
spatial discretization that aims to approximate our continuous diﬀerential equations; it is tied
to mathematical concepts, it is not a grid of sensors. Consequently, without a tool to estimate
cross-correlated error, we are unable to conclude whether the error arises from the approxima-
tion of our balance equations or from the balance equations themselves, thus, implicating an
error in the modeling. Similarly, even after optimizing parameters and mesh based on numerous
experimental comparisons, if the model is used in a scenario lacking experimental comparison,
the results remain subject to no physical interpretation. This makes the model non-predictive.
To conclude, the TRITON model no longer handle the criterion based on mesh size but
focuses only on the void fraction criterion. Section 3.2.4of this chapter is actually dedicated
to understanding the origin of this criterion and attributing it a physically interpretable value.
This chapter is dedicated to understanding, adapting, and validating the modeling by focusing
on addressing potential challenges arising from turbulence and the modeling of both gas groups.
An area of potential concern lies in the interaction between the two-phase model and single-
phase turbulence. Consequently, our initial focus is directed towards investigating and under-
standing this coupling phenomenon, speciﬁcally for two distinct conﬁgurations. We aim to assess
the sensitivity of the two-phase modeling approach through the use of three distinct turbulence
models:k−ε,SSG, andEBRSM . Additionally, we seek to evaluate the contribution of the
bubble induced turbulence model (denoted as LI) in enhancing predictive accuracy. Our focus is
centered on air-water ﬂows in vertical channels. Rather than primarily focusing on ﬁne-tuning
model parameters to achieve optimal predictions, our study lies in investigating the development
of a well-established quasi-steady solution within an elongated channel. To ease this analysis,
we undertake numerical simulations and compare their outcomes with experimental data from
two sources: [126], which is a rectangular section channel (see Figure 3.2), and [122], which
deals with a square section channel (see to Figure 3.5). The simulations are performed in three
79Chapter 3 – New modeling and modiﬁcations based on channel ﬂow investigations
dimensions using the NEPTUNE_CFD software, including gravity.
3.1.2 Air-water ﬂow in a rectangular section channel
The experimental setup, detailed in [126], encompasses a vertical channel with a height of 2.95
m and a rectangular cross-section measuring 200×10mm2, as visually represented in Figure
3.2. In this setup, the test case is characterized by superﬁcial velocities of jl= 0.63m/s for
the liquid phase and jg= 0.42m/s for the gas phase. Various local parameters, including the
void fraction ( αg1), gas velocity (magnitude of Ug1), interfacial area concentration ( aig1), and
Sauter mean diameter ( Dsm1), are measured. These measurements are conducted using probes
positioned on a quarter cross-section. For clarity, Figure 3.2 provides insight into the speciﬁc
(x,y)coordinates of the probes. The y-averaged values are subsequently calculated through
summations across the data collected from these probes.
For numerical simulations, speciﬁc boundary conditions are applied at the inlet. Notably, the
void fractions are set to αg1= 0.344andαg2= 0.077. Additionally, axial velocities are speciﬁed
asUl= 1.25m/s for the liquid phase, and Ug1=Ug2= 1.389m/s for both gas phases. Further-
more, Sauter mean diameters are initialized at Dsm1= 3mm for the ﬁrst group and Dsm2= 17
mm for the second group.
To perform these simulations, a mesh comprising 440,000 individual elements is used. This
mesh was determined through a comprehensive mesh sensitivity analysis that encompassed dif-
ferent meshes, including 80,000, 440,000, and 1,170,000 cells. The results of this analysis conclu-
sively indicated that numerical predictions of αg1converged eﬀectively with the mesh containing
440,000 cells.
Figure 3.3a illustrates the evolution of/angbracketleftbigaig1/angbracketrightbig, which represents the time-averaged and y-
averaged interfacial area concentration of the ﬁrst gas group, at a speciﬁc height of z= 2.7
m. The plot is presented in terms of the dimensionless distance x/w. Notably, all turbulence
models successfully capture the experimentally observed variations in/angbracketleftbigaig1/angbracketrightbig. The behavior of/angbracketleftbigaig1/angbracketrightbigdemonstrates a distinct pattern: it initially rises in the near-wall region ( x/w→0),
reaches a peak close to x/w≈Dsm1/w, and subsequently decreases to nearly constant values
asx/w→0.5(which corresponds to the center of the channel). Comparing the numerical
predictions with experimental data, the k−εturbulence model exhibits the least deviation, with
discrepancies amounting to a maximum of approximately 13%. On the other hand, the EBRSM
turbulence model shows the highest level of deviation. This can be attributed to the gradual
dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy in the EBRSM model, leading to the breakup of bubbles
and subsequent reduction in their diameters. This phenomenon is addressed more eﬀectively
by the SSG and k−εturbulence models, which maintain higher turbulence intensity along the
channel and consequently experience minimal bubble breakup. Particularly noteworthy is the
performance of the EBRSM+LI turbulence model, which successfully mitigates this challenge
by preserving elevated turbulence intensity throughout the channel.
Figure 3.3b presents the evolution of /angbracketleftαg1/angbracketright, which represents the time-averaged and y-
averaged void fraction of the ﬁrst gas group, as a function of the dimensionless distance x/wat a
speciﬁc height z= 2.7m. All turbulence models correctly replicate the experimentally observed
variations in/angbracketleftαg1/angbracketright. The behavior of /angbracketleftαg1/angbracketrightfollows a distinct pattern: it initially increases in the
near-wall region ( x/w→Dsm1/w), attains a peak in proximity to x/w≈0, and subsequently
stabilizes at nearly constant values as x/w→0.5(which corresponds to the center of the chan-
nel). Comparing the numerical predictions with experimental data, the k−εturbulence model
demonstrates the least deviation, with discrepancies reaching a maximum of approximately 6%.
In contrast, the EBRSM+LI turbulence model exhibits the highest deviation. This can be at-

notable liquid velocities and restricted void fraction drift. However, the void fraction prediction
is inﬂuenced by the drag model, which does not encompass turbulence eﬀects. To mitigate
this limitation, potential corrections based on factors like turbulent intensity or adjusted inlet
velocities could be implemented. It is notable that the current shortage of experimental data in
the near-wall region limits precise determination of the maximum value and location of /angbracketleftαg1/angbracketrightin

within the near-wall region ( x/w→Dsm1/w) and subsequently saturates as it approaches the
central region ( x/w→0.5). Despite the qualitative agreement for the variations, notable de-
viations arise between numerical predictions and experimental measurements, particularly in
the near-wall region. The EBRSM+LI model demonstrates a deviation of approximately 14%,
while the EBRSM model exhibits a larger deviation of around 25%. It is notable that both the
EBRSM+LI and EBRSM models are the only ones capable of predicting low values of /angbracketleft|vg1|/angbracketrightas
x/w→0due to the absence of wall laws in their formulation.

section, our assessment extends to the evaluation of turbulence models within the context of a

3.1.3 Air-water ﬂow in a square section channel
The experimental conﬁguration detailed in [122] involves a vertical channel with a height of
2.95m and a square cross-section measuring 136×136mm2, as depicted in Figure 3.5. In this
setup, the test case is characterized by superﬁcial velocities of jl= 0.50m/s for the liquid phase
andjg= 0.09m/s for the gas phase. Various local parameters, including the void fraction
(αg1), gas velocity (magnitude of Ug1), interfacial area concentration ( aig1), and Sauter mean
diameter (Dsm1), are measured. Probes are positioned along three lines within a quarter cross-
section, as illustrated in Figure 3.5. It is crucial to note that the experimental study does not
provide a localized estimation of experimental error. Consequently, global errors are utilized in
the subsequent presentation of results to approximate the experimental error. Furthermore, the
experiment conducted by [122] provides a mean to evaluate the turbulent kinetic energy ( k),
enabling the validation of the turbulence modelling.
Regrading the numerical simulations, speciﬁc boundary conditions are imposed at the inlet. For
void fractions, these conditions are set as αg1= 0.152andαg2= 0.00. Axial velocities are
prescribed as vl= 0.59m/s for the liquid phase, and vg1=vg2= 0.59m/s for both gas phases.
Additionally, Sauter mean diameters are initialized at Dsm1= 4mm for the ﬁrst group and
Dsm2= 11mm for the second group.
To perform these simulations, a mesh comprising 676,000 individual elements is used. This
mesh was determined through a comprehensive mesh sensitivity analysis that encompassed dif-
ferent meshes, including 130,000, 676,000, and 3,256,000 cells. The results of this analysis
conclusively indicated that numerical predictions of αg1converged eﬀectively with the mesh
containing 676,000 cells.

duce the observed variations. Speciﬁcally, /angbracketleftαg1/angbracketrightincreases within the near-wall region ( x/c→1),

reaches a peak close to x/c≈1−Dsm1/c, and subsequently stabilizes as x/c→0(center of the
channel). The oscillatory behavior observed in most models, excluding EBRSM+LI, arises from
weak turbulent dispersion and pronounced deviating phenomena near the wall region. Where
the models diﬀer signiﬁcantly is in the prediction of the void fraction peak within the near-wall
region. The SSG model exhibits the largest disparity, with the peak positioned approximately
60%further from the wall. Consequently, the void fraction prediction for the probe closest to
the wall is over 10 times smaller than the experimental data. This discrepancy can be attributed
to the SSG model’s tendency to predict increased turbulent energy in the near-wall region (as
observed in Figure 3.9), leading to greater bubble growth and an additional peak closer to the
wall. On the contrary, the EBRSM+LI model displays the smallest overall deviation, with a
maximum local error of 16%. This model’s performance is notable for its improved prediction
accuracy in capturing the void fraction peak, further enhancing its reliability in this context.

quently decreases as x/c→0toward the center of the channel. In contrast, among the other
models, the k−εmodel predicts an increment of /angbracketleftvl/angbracketrightasx/c→1, followed by a tendency toward
a near-constant value as x/c→0exhibiting a non-physical wall acceleration. The EBRSM
model displays an opposite trend in the center of the channel ( x/c→0), while correctly pre-
dicting the behavior in the near-wall region ( x/c→1). The SSG model, due to the position of
the void fraction peak, depicts a notable decrease in axial velocity within the near-wall region
(x/c→1), leveling oﬀ to an almost constant value as x/c→0. In terms of overall performance,
the EBRSM+LI model emerges as the most accurate and consistent, boasting the smallest over-
all discrepancy in comparison to the experimental data.
Figure 3.7 illustrates the evolution along the bisector line of /angbracketleftαg1/angbracketright(time-averaged void frac-
tion of the ﬁrst gas group) and /angbracketleftvl/angbracketright(time-averaged axial liquid velocity) as functions of the
dimensionless distance x/wat a speciﬁc height of z= 2.2m. Focusing on/angbracketleftαg1/angbracketright, all turbulence
models, excluding the k−εmodel, faithfully reproduce the observed variations. This includes
the behavior where /angbracketleftαg1/angbracketrightincreases within the near-wall region ( x/c→1), reaches a peak near
x/c≈1−Dsm1/c, and subsequently stabilizes toward an almost constant value as x/c→0
(center of the channel). Among the models, the EBRSM turbulence model exhibits the largest
deviation, reaching approximately 23%. This discrepancy is most prominent in the misplaced
void fraction wall peak, as observed in the diagonal line assessment. It is notable that the SSG
model also displays a similar issue of a misplaced void fraction wall peak in the bisector line
assessment.
Regarding/angbracketleftvl/angbracketright, all models consistently fall within the range of error bars. However, only the
SSG and EBRSM models accurately reproduce the observed variations of the experimental data.
This variation displays an increase in /angbracketleftvl/angbracketrightwithin the near-wall region ( x/c→1), followed by an
almost constant value as x/c→0, corresponding to the center of the channel. In contrast, the
k−εmodel predicts an increase in /angbracketleftvl/angbracketrightasx/c→1, and approaches an almost constant value as
x/c→0, a behavior that seems to hide the speciﬁc wall law used. This discrepancy stems from
the non-physical wall acceleration attributed to the intricate interplay between gas forces and
wall laws, which strongly interact with the liquid ﬁeld within the initial cells. The EBRSM+LI
model accurately reproduces the behavior observed for /angbracketleftvl/angbracketright: an increase within the near-wall
region (x/c→1) followed by a decrease as x/c→0toward the center of the channel. This
robust consistency further underscores the reliability of the EBRSM+LI model in capturing the
ﬂow dynamics.
Figure 3.8 shows the near-wall line evolution of /angbracketleftαg1/angbracketright(time-averaged void fraction of the
ﬁrst gas group) and /angbracketleftvl/angbracketright(time-averaged axial liquid velocity) as functions of the dimensionless
distancex/wat a speciﬁc height of z= 2.2m. For/angbracketleftαg1/angbracketright, all turbulence models accurately
reproduce the observed variations. As previously discussed, /angbracketleftαg1/angbracketrightexhibits an increase within
the near-wall region ( x/c→1), peaks near x/c≈1−Dsm1/c, and subsequently stabilizes
toward an almost constant value as x/c→0(center of the channel). However, a constant
discrepancy emerges for all models around the center of the channel ( x/c→0), with the SSG
modeldemonstratingthehighestdeviationofapproximately 30%. Thisemphasizesthepotential
for enhancement and modelling in accurately capturing near-wall behaviors. The conclusions
drawn from the diagonal and bisector line analyses hold parallels within this near-wall line

the dimensionless distance x/wat a speciﬁc height of z= 2.2m. This selection of the bisec-
tor line is deliberate, as the isotropic assumption used to derive these experimental values is

models, which amounts to approximately 60%,70%, and 70%, respectively, at the center of the
channel. The disparities among the latter three models are primarily localized in the near-wall
region, where a signiﬁcant increase coincides with the position of the void fraction wall peak.
The capability of the EBRSM+LI model to reproduce both the turbulence trend and intensity
is attributed to the use of BIT. Unlike the other models, which only account for single-phase
turbulent kinetic energy, the EBRSM+LI model introduces ﬂuctuations owing to drag forces.
It is crucial to highlight that the pure turbulent intensity remains relatively low, indicative of a
process of turbulence reduction due to the localized reduction in the volumetric presence of the

energy intensity exists between the experimental data and the EBRSM+LI model’s prediction,
it still leads to a favorable prediction and trend for the liquid velocity, further underlining the
model’s competence in capturing the complex ﬂow dynamics.
Consequently, the comprehensive prediction of the EBRSM+LI model emerges as notably
interesting. This model demonstrates a reduced level of deviation and successfully captures the
correct trends for variables such as void fraction, liquid velocity, and turbulent kinetic energy.

Despite these strengths, it is crucial to note that when compared to the experimental data, both
the void fraction and liquid velocity exhibit a trend to be under-predicted by the EBRSM+LI
model.
The combination of TRITON modeling and turbulence appears to yield proﬁles with similar
trends to the experimental data for the EBRSM and EBRSM+LI models in terms of velocity
and near-wall void fraction, although the void fraction is generally underestimated compared
to the experimental results. This observation may be attributed to a potential problem with
the drag force in the simulation. Another explanation could also stem from the experimen-
tal measurements. In fact, it appears that the experimenter measured a local void fraction of
< αg>= 0.139at the center and considered this value as a measurement for the entire cross-
section. If we use the calculation from the next section, < Ur>=< Ub > (1−< αg>)1/2, we
obtain< Ur>≈0.213m/s, which corresponds to a gas velocity of Ug≈0.803m/s, and thus,
a local void fraction of αg≈0.11. This result aligns with the simulation by measuring at the
center of the channel. Now, if we perform a reverse calculation to obtain the experimental values
measured at the center, we can use the following equations:
<Ug>≈<Ul>+<Ub>(1−<αg>)1/2, (3.1)
<αg>=jg
<Ug>. (3.2)
Then, we get :
jg≈<αg>(<Ul>+<Ub>(1−<αg>)1/2). (3.3)
The experimental measurements yield < Ul>≈0.68m/s and< αg>= 0.139. The exper-
imentalist then calculated jg=< αg>< Ul>≈0.09m/s using local measurements. However,
according to the calculation, we obtain jg= 0.124m/s, which is greater than 0.09m/s, resulting
in a cross-sectionnal void fraction of <αg>= 0.182. This value is more consistent with a central
void fraction of 0.139and a wall void fraction of 0.2. To accurately compute this case, the fol-
lowinginjectionparametersshouldbeused: jg= 0.124m/s,jl= 0.556m/s, and<αg>= 0.182.
89Chapter 3 – New modeling and modiﬁcations based on channel ﬂow investigations
Beyond conﬁrming the coupling between turbulence and TRITON, it appears that a diﬀerent
modeling approach is still required to account for eﬀects speciﬁc to the presence of the obstacle.
Particularly, there are issues related to modeling small bubbles, including concerns about forces,
source terms, and turbulence. The next section, therefore, addresses the challenges encountered
in TRITON modeling from the perspective of the dispersed bubbles groups.
3.2 On the modeling of the two groups of bubbles
An aspect that need careful consideration is the modeling of the bubbles under conditions of
high void fraction. As illustrated in the previous section, there exists a possibility that the issue
might be attributed to the models of hydrodynamical forces, of the source terms within the
IATE, or of the bubble induced turbulence. As a mean to address this potential concern, we
suggest conducting an investigation into all these aforementioned models. Indeed, most models
have been developed and validated for moderate void fractions. Thus, non-physical divergence
issues due to high void fractions have not been addressed in the literature.
3.2.1 Modifying and adapting forces
The hydrodynamical closure models are fundamental components of the momentum equation,
crucial for accurately predicting the velocities of both gas and liquid phases and their respective
void fractions. Despite numerous studies available in the literature, most of these models have
been validated primarily for scenarios involving low to moderate void fractions and are not al-
ways coupled with turbulence. When attempting to apply these closure models to more complex
conﬁgurations, their performance becomes uncertain. The lack of a widely accepted universal
combination of forces adds diﬃculties. Incorporating additional complexity into a speciﬁc model
can introduce numerical issues when combined with other models. Thus, the issue of divergence
and poor performance can partially be attributed to the dispersed forces. Notably, these hy-
drodynamical closure models have not been adequately validated for ﬂows around a cylinder,
indicating a signiﬁcant gap in their applicability when dealing with such geometries.
As a reminder, the interfacial momentum exchange term is modeled by hydrodynamical forces

Turbulent dispersion.(3.4)
The primary challenge in simulating ﬂow around a cylinder lies in accurately predicting a
high void fraction near the cylinder. To address this issue, it becomes crucial to investigate
forces that non-linearly depend on the void fraction. Such forces include the drag force FD
l−>g,
added mass force FAM
l−>g, and turbulent dispersion FT
l−>g.
Drag force
The ﬁrst force to investigate is the drag force FD
l−>g. Consider an upward adiabatic free bubbly
ﬂow - only 1st group bubbles - in a rectangular channel, without wall, we neglect the turbulence,
the bubbles interactions and the viscous shear. In this scenario, we can assume a homogeneous
dispersed ﬂow with bubbles. Assuming that the ﬂow is statistically steady, it becomes obvious
that only the drag force signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the ﬂow dynamics. Other forces can be disre-
garded due to the idealized conditions. From equation 2.79, we derive the following 1Dbalance
equation in the direction of the relative velocity, denoted as Ur, with respect to the gas phase,

withPthe pressure ﬁeld :
αg∇P=FD
l−>g−αgρgg. (3.5)
Similarly, we also derive from equation 2.81 the following 1Dbalance equation for the relative
velocity, with respect to the liquid phase, by neglecting liquid velocity changes :
(1−αg)∇P=−FD
l−>g−(1−αg)ρlg. (3.6)
By considering the equations for the relative velocity in both the gas and liquid phases, and
taking into account that the pressure is uniform and equal for both ﬁelds, we deduce from
equations 3.5 and 3.6 the following:
∇P=−((1−αg)ρl+αgρg)g. (3.7)
By considering the classical drag force, equation 3.5 can be rewritten as :

locity approaches inﬁnity. To maintain model accuracy, physical consistency, and continuity for
the ﬁrst group of bubbles, the most elegant approach is to introduce a new drag coeﬃcient. This
new coeﬃcient will appropriately modify the drag force model, allowing for better predictions
of the behavior of the gas phase without sacriﬁcing the model’s overall performance :
CDg1= max(CDlow,min(CDellipse,max(CDcap,CDellipse (αg= 0)))). (3.11)
Added mass force
The next force to be explored is the added mass force FAM
l−>g. This force comes into play in
accelerating bubbly ﬂows as a result of the surrounding ﬂuid’s inﬂuence on the acceleration of
bubbles within the ﬂow. The added mass force becomes especially signiﬁcant in ﬂows around a
cylinder due to the deviation induced around the cylinder. As a reminder, the Zuber’s added
mass coeﬃcient[90] is proportional to1+2αg
1−αg. It becomes obvious that when αg→1this ex-
pression tends toward inﬁnity, which is not physical. To overcome this issue and ensure a valid
model even at high void fractions, a modiﬁed version is required. The expression proposed by
Cai and Wallis [6] presents an interesting approach as it provides an averaged model that yields
a ﬁnite value when the void fraction approaches 1. Moreover, the model used can be viewed as
a special case of the model used, when the density ratio between the liquid and gas is inﬁnite,
91Chapter 3 – New modeling and modiﬁcations based on channel ﬂow investigations
and the void fraction remains at moderate levels. The expression of the force is then as follows :

For air-water, it highlights the very small diﬀerence between the models until αg≈0.8. Then,
while Zuber coeﬃcient tends to inﬁnity, Cai and Wallis’ tends toward γfor any case.
Turbulent dispersion force
The last force to investigate is the turbulent dispersion force FT
l−>g. This force allows redistri-
bution of the void fraction by the ﬂow ﬂuctuations. The original expression of the force suﬀers
from being overly isotropic, leading to excessive dispersion behind cylinders. This dispersion has
a detrimental eﬀect on dynamical structures, particularly on bubble clusters, which are crucial
for accurately representing real physical processes. By substituting the turbulent kinetic energy
with the Reynolds stress in the force expression, the model promotes non-isotropic dispersion.
To extend this force, we can refer to the work presented in [64]. The expression proposed in [64]
is primarily focused on the drag and added mass forces, with the possibility of easily incorpo-
rating additional terms from their ﬁnal equation. By disregarding the lift force, if we examine
92Chapter 3 – New modeling and modiﬁcations based on channel ﬂow investigations
the ﬁnal balance equation as presented in [64], we can express it as follows:

To account for this phenomenon, we can observe that the termb+ηr
1+ηr+αg
1−αgplays a signiﬁcant
role in predicting GTD behavior. This term in the model reﬂects the variance of liquid ﬂuctua-
tions encountered along the trajectory of a bubble. It is broken down into two components. The
94Chapter 3 – New modeling and modiﬁcations based on channel ﬂow investigations
ﬁrst component represents the correlation of liquid ﬂuctuations associated with gas ﬂuctuations,
while the second component represents the correlation arising from the spatial distribution of
gas. To account for areas with high void fractions caused by the spatial decorrelation of the gas
distribution, like around cylinders, there needs to be a limitation on the void fraction related
to this decorrelation. To better grasp this phenomenon, we consider a simpliﬁed scenario where
the density ratio is assumed to be inﬁnite, allowing us to use the Zuber model and neglect the
density ratio in b=1+CAM

Figure 3.12 illustrates the behavior of the two components of the term with respect to the
voidfraction. Theﬁrstcomponentb+ηr
1+ηrexhibitsadecreasingtrendasthevoidfractionincreases.
This is because at low void fractions, there is a strong correlation between gas and liquid
ﬂuctuations, primarily inﬂuenced by the bubble whose trajectory we are following. However,
as the void fraction rises and more bubbles appear, the correlation between gas and liquid
ﬂuctuations weakens, as the inﬂuence of the leading bubble weakens. This behavior is logically
consistent with the physical understanding of the system. Conversely, the second component
αg
1−αgshows an increasing trend with increasing void fraction. When the void fraction is low,
there is limited correlation between ﬂuctuations along the bubble trajectory and the bubbles
away from the trajectory. However, as the void fraction increases, the coherence between these
ﬂuctuations grows rapidly due to the ﬂow’s inherent symmetry. This behavior is also in line
with our understanding. It is crucial to note that this component diverges as the void fraction
approaches 1. This divergenceindicates that the modelor approach used in the analysisbecomes
inadequate near complete gas phase, and additional considerations or modiﬁcations may be
necessary to account for such conditions.
Figure 3.13 represents the evolution of the full term as a function of αgfor diﬀerent ηr.
Notably, regardless of the value of ηr, the term tends toward inﬁnity when αgtends toward 1.
This behavior is primarily due to the ratio of the gas fraction to that of the liquid. To better
understand how to address this issue, we can consider two ideal cases.
As a reminder, ηrrepresents the ratio between the characteristic time of turbulence along the
trajectory of the bubble and the characteristic time of the bubble. The ﬁrst case is when ηr= 0,
as depicted in Figure 3.13. It means that the turbulence is instantaneous with respect to the
bubble trajectory. In this situation, the bubbles move in a turbulent ﬁeld that remains undis-
turbed. Consequently, the maximum variance of ﬂuctuations experienced by the distribution of
bubbles is when there is no bubble in the turbulent ﬁeld, which occurs when αg= 0.
The second case, represented in Figure 3.13, is when ηr→∞. It means that the bubble path
is instantaneous with respect to the time of turbulent structures. In this scenario, turbulence
completely disperses the bubbles, and the liquid ﬂuctuations encountered along their trajectory
are only due to the ﬂuctuations of the liquid ﬂow. As a result, the correlation tends toward 1,
which again corresponds to the case when αg= 0, i.e., when bubbles are absent. Therefore, in
the general case, the maximum deviation of liquid ﬂuctuations encountered on a bubble trajec-
tory occurs when there is no bubble. In other words, the presence of bubbles does not lead to
an increase in the deviation of liquid ﬂuctuations along their path compared to the ﬂuctuations
generated in the liquid itself (this eﬀect is taken into account in the turbulent time in ηr). The
wake of the bubbles remains a source of ﬂuctuations, but it cannot introduce wider liquid ﬂuc-
tuations than what is already present in the liquid turbulence. This observation gives rise to

depends on ηr:
αgmax =5−ηr

Notably, when ηr= 0,αgmaxreaches5
8= 0.625. This value is similar to the commonly used
value for a random stack of solid spheres 0.62and is also consistent with the limits of compact-
ness observed in the bubbly regime. Indeed, the origin of this value is somewhat underdiscussed
from a theoretical point of view in the literature, as it stems from experimental data. [85] oﬀers
an explanation based on the diﬀerence between the added mass of a bubble distribution (Zuber
model) and the one derived from a potential calculation ( CAM= 5×2
3). However, contrary
to what is indicated, the calculation actually yields αg=17
26≈0.654. However, this idea has
forged the basis for most of the considerations presented in this thesis regarding the added mass.

For air-water ﬂow, αgmax≈0.623andαgmin≈0.3250. It appears that Zuber model [90] is
satisfying for the modeling of dispersion in the current system.
The dispersion coeﬃcient is ultimately constrained by αgmaxfrom equation 3.22. Figure

The prediction of forces depends not only on the void fraction but also on the mean Sauter
diameter. Predicting this diameter relies signiﬁcantly on the prediction of the interfacial area
and, consequently, the IATE. The source terms in the IATE equations are crucial for replicating
bubble mechanisms. However, they are based on considerations regarding forces and the values
of predicted ﬁelds, which are then adjusted to experimental values through their evolution in
cross-sections. To use them accurately, particularly for high void fractions, it is necessary to
study them locally. This is the focus of the next section.
3.2.2 Modifying and adapting the source terms
The challenges in TRITON’s interfacial area modeling arise from the need to accurately repre-
sent the complex interactions of coalescence and break-up between bubbles (see section 2.2.3).
Source terms are introduced in the equations that describe these interactions between bubbles.
These source terms are essentially simpliﬁed mathematical representations of the underlying
physical mechanisms governing coalescence and break-up. To validate and optimize these mod-
els, researchers typically compute a 1Dversion of the equations (in the cross-section), which
allows for easier analysis and comparison with experimental data. While the equations them-
selves have been successfully computed in 3DCFD simulations, the models have mostly been
confronted to bubbly ﬂows without obstacle. As a result, there are concerns about the suitabil-
ity and accuracy of some of these models due to their reliance on simplistic assumptions and
99Chapter 3 – New modeling and modiﬁcations based on channel ﬂow investigations
theoretical considerations. The main issue lies in the emergence of regions with a high void
fraction. Those areas are manifesting when obstacles, such as cylinders, are present within the
ﬂuid domain. As a reminder, the source terms are based on the ﬁve following categories : RC,
WE, TI, SO and SI (see section 2.2.3).
The ﬁrst source terms that may cause issues are RC terms. Indeed, almost all models are
proportional to the following three functions h1, h2, h3(see appendices A.2), with CRC1= 3.0:

Figure 3.17 depicts the evolution of the functions h1,h2, andh3derived from the IATE
source terms with respect to the void fraction of group 1. Notably, all three functions exhibit
a pronounced discontinuity at αg1max= 0.62and take large positive values for h1and large
negative values for h2andh3whenαg1>0.62. This discontinuity is particularly concerning
as it leads to a divergence in coalescence around this void fraction value. Moreover, the plot
reveals that the issue arises at an earlier stage for the function h1compared to h2andh3.

tion made from the graph is that as the void fraction approaches αgmax, there is a divergence of
the source term, leading to an inﬁnite coalescence. The modiﬁcation is based on two key prin-
ciples: continuity of the source term and independence of random collisions from the presence
of an individual bubble once it becomes uncorrelated from the mean ﬂow. The selected solution
involves saturating the source term, constraining its value to be constant when αg>0.509. This
means that when the void fraction equals or surpasses 0.509, the source term will be capped at
this threshold, thereby preventing its divergence toward inﬁnity. Notably, the function value of
h1is ten times higher than the previously established value of 0.325, which was identiﬁed as a
cross-sectional limit for bubbly ﬂow. Moreover, both 0.509and0.325are close to the values in
[104], used for predictions in TRACE (Transient Reactor Analysis Code), the american coun-
terpart of the french CATHARE (Code for Analysis of THermalhydraulics during Accident of
101Chapter 3 – New modeling and modiﬁcations based on channel ﬂow investigations
Reactor and safety Evaluation) developed at CEA. Speciﬁcally, 0.602gives a function value of
h1ten times the one of 0.509. However, upon examining these cases, it becomes obvious that a
void fraction of 0.509yields the most appropriate coalescence behavior, given that the original
value of 0.602still induces excessive coalescence phenomena.

to have a good modeling of this term for large void fractions. Figure 3.19 shows the evolution
ofCD1bubbly for diﬀerent bubble diameters in the order of a millimeter. In particular, when
the void fraction approaches 1, CD1tends towards inﬁnity. It can therefore no longer be used
in modelling. One way to solve this problem, proposed by Tomiyama [132] is to consider for the
high void fraction CD2=8
3(1−αg)2. We then take CD=min(CD1,CD2).
Figure 3.19 also shows the behavior of CD2cap-bubbly according to the void fraction. Note this
time thatCD2tends to 0whenαgtends to 1. However, Uris inversely proportional to CD, so if
CD2tends to 0 then Urtends to inﬁnity, which is not physically acceptable. To solve this, the
idea is to remember that there is a quasi-static limit for void fraction. There is therefore a limit
for the average bubble drag coeﬃcients compared to that of a single bubble. We therefore choose
for high void fraction, corresponding to a "single" bubble dynamic, to use the drag coeﬃcient of
a single bubble. We thus obtain CD=min(CD1,max (CD2,CD1(αg= 0))). Depending on the
chosen diameter we thus obtain 2cases :
102Chapter 3 – New modeling and modiﬁcations based on channel ﬂow investigations
mEither the diameter is too large (around 4mm) and no swarm eﬀect is considered and the
drag coeﬃcient of a single bubble is used.

for a bubble of 3mm.
Figure 3.20 shows the evolution of the new drag coeﬃcient as a function of void fraction for a
bubble of 3mm, corresponding to the 2nd case previously mentioned.
Additionally, within the source terms, there is a modeling that corresponds to the relative
velocity of the bubbles from group 1 within the wake of the bubbles from the second group.
This velocity, denoted as Uw12, depends on the relative velocities of the two groups of bubbles
and the modeling of a wake velocity, denoted as Urw2= 0.94Ur2C1/3
Dcap:
Uw12=Urw2+Ur1−Ur2. (3.32)
Three source terms are then directly proportional to this velocity. However, it is highly sensitive
to the prediction of the diﬀerent ﬁelds and can lead to a signiﬁcant mass transfer between gas
ﬁelds, resulting in acceleration and possibly even changing the sign of the source term. To
better apprehend the issue, we can use the solution derived in the section (3.2.1)to obtain

Dsm2

g∆ρandαgtot=αg1+αg2.
The problem occurs in the near-wall region causing Ur1to become very small compared to Ur2.
In this situation, Uw12∝0.94(8
3(1−αg2)2)1/3−1, which becomes negative when αg2≈0.328
for any value of the mean Sauter diameter. Consequently, the term is null whereas there is no
physical explanation of it.
As previously discussed, using the Ishii drag coeﬃcient [84] leads to its divergence when αg1
103Chapter 3 – New modeling and modiﬁcations based on channel ﬂow investigations
tends toward 1. Therefore, we neglect the eﬀects of void fraction on the calculation of the drag
coeﬃcient for group 1. In the general case with the aforementioned expressions, we obtain the
followingh4function so that Uw12=Ur1h4:

and so is damped to 0. For instance, considering the critical diameter value yields a maximum
void fraction of approximately 0.65, near the close packing limit of the ﬁrst group. Indeed, for
Dsm2=Dcritthe bubbles behavior must be similar to the one of the ﬁrst group. However, for
Dsm2= 10Dcritits value is approximately 0.485, it could correspond to too short wakes from
group 2, compared to group 1path, that can not entrain the bubbles of the ﬁrst group until
meeting. Notably, a point of intersection appears for αg2≈0.328regardless of the diameter of
group 2. Although, group 2and group 1void fraction phenomena are diﬀerent, those values
appearing in this model seem to be close to group 1void fraction phenomena. This expression
allows keeping the physics on which this expression is based while avoiding issues of divergence
and rapid changes near the wall. Indeed, the model does not take into account near-wall eﬀects.
Another issue with the source terms of the RC and TI model is related to the use of the
turbulent dissipation ε(see appendices A.2). Even in single-phase ﬂows, this variable is known
for its diﬃculty in quantiﬁcation and its varying orders of magnitude, making it less reliable in
source terms. Furthermore, in the EBRSM model, εcan take very large values, especially near
walls. However, in the RC and TI models, εis used to quantify the turbulent eddies. Moreover,
the dissipation near the wall is not only related to local eddies. Indeed, the EBRSM model tries

withkis the turbulent kinetic energy and νis the kinematic viscosity. By limiting εin this way,
the model accounts for the isotropic behavior and aligns better with the assumptions made in
the RC modeling approach. This modiﬁcation helps to improve the accuracy and reliability of
the RC model, especially in regions near walls where non-local eﬀects can signiﬁcantly impact
the turbulence characteristics.
As previously discussed, it is crucial to accurately predict turbulent quantities such as dissi-
pation and turbulent kinetic energy to compute the source terms, the coupling forces, and even
the mean liquid velocity ﬁeld. Pseudo-turbulence remains an area with more open questions
than answers, and in the following section, we modestly propose to address some discrepancies
between models for our speciﬁc application.
3.2.3 Modifying and adapting two-phase turbulence
While bubble-induced turbulence appears eﬀective in a channel, its application around a cylin-
der gives rise to certain issues. The only available experiment in the literature that investigates
two-phase ﬂow around a cylinder, speciﬁcally addressing the ﬂuctuations induced by bubbles,
is [65]. Although this study handle a cylinder diameter of 30mm, bubble velocities on the
order of 0.3m/s, and bubble diameters ranging from 3.4mm to 4mm – which are compa-
rable to the experiment conducted at CEA – the experiment only covers void fractions below
2%. Consequently, direct comparison is available only with CFD studies in order to account for
bubble-induced ﬂuctuations and its interaction with a cylinder.
The primary problem is an overestimation of dissipation, which leads to the almost complete
dissipation of turbulence. This issue arises from the challenge of selecting an appropriate relax-
ation time for the bubbles. In the basic model, the scale chosen is denoted as τb= (D2
sm
ε)1/3.
However, in the EBRSM model, as the ﬂow approaches the cylinder, dissipation shows a signif-
icant increase. Consequently, this mechanism causes a sharp reduction in the τbscale. As the
dissipation linked to bubbles is inversely proportional to this characteristic time, it results in a
substantial dissipation source. The dissipation becomes so intense that it eﬀectively eliminates
all turbulent structures. To address this challenge, two solutions can be considered: to reduce
the inﬂuence of bubbles near the wall, or/and, to modify the scale of this relaxation process.
Due to the asymptotic behavior of the EBRSM, a solution arises. The EBRSM relies on a re-
laxation equation between two pressure redistribution models: a local and a non-local one. The
transition between these models is identiﬁed by the variable β. Bubble ﬂuctuations occur due
to local pressure changes as bubbles pass through. Therefore, the solution involves modulating
the BIT using the same scale β. To switch from the local model to the non-local model, all BIT-
related sources should be multiplied by β3. The second solution involves a simple adjustment
of the timescale τb. In recent literature, two other scales are preferred:Db
UrandDb√
k. The ﬁrst
scale yields slightly better results in the center of the channels, while the second provides better
105Chapter 3 – New modeling and modiﬁcations based on channel ﬂow investigations
results close to the walls - see [75]. To avoid the characteristic time becoming almost zero, one
can consider the following expression :
τb=max/parenleftBigg
Db
Ur,Db√
k/parenrightBigg
. (3.35)
Another aspect of this modeling, which has not been adequately addressed in the literature,
regard the derivation of the coeﬃcients used in the model. Currently, there is no justiﬁcation
provided for these coeﬃcients. Therefore, it becomes crucial to compare this model, which
depends on the direction of Ur, with existing literature. One straightforward approach is to
compare it with the Colombo model. To derive the Colombo solution, one needs to reorganize
the terms considering a single direction of bubble movement. Upon performing the calculations
in our case, we obtain coeﬃcients of 10/9in the direction of ﬂow and 4/9in the transverse
directions. On the other hand, Colombo’s model yields coeﬃcients of 1in the direction of ﬂow
and0.5in the transverse directions. While the values are close, they are diﬀerent. However,
no justiﬁcation has been provided for this discrepancy. The proposed idea is to reevaluate the
model using the Colombo coeﬃcients. The recalculated model yields the following results:

It is then interesting to investigate the behavior of the model in three idealized scenarios:

case. The outcomes of this analysis are summarized in Table 3.1. The study reveals that the
energy level of the two models is identical, but there are slight diﬀerences in the redistribution
process. Notably, the modiﬁed version aligns more closely with the ﬁndings reported in the
existing literature.
In this section, we focused on modeling bubbles from Group 1. Despite a fairly extensive
literature on modeling quasi-spherical bubbles, modiﬁcations were needed concerning the forces,
IATE source terms, and pseudo-turbulence to properly account for the unique topology of a ﬂow
with obstacles. The other group also exhibited modeling challenges but had relatively limited
literature available. Consequently, we had to take a new perspective and develop a diﬀerent
model to ease the calculations. The following section speciﬁcally deals with the modeling of the
deformed bubble group and provides a comparison with an experimental case.
3.2.4 On the impact of the added mass of the second group
During the case study involving a majority of bubbles from the second group and high void frac-
tions, several signiﬁcant issues arose. The activation zones of the LIM (interface reconstruction
method) were very wide due to strong void fraction gradients, particularly near the walls and
upstream of the cylinder. Several causes have been identiﬁed:
mFrom group 2diameter ﬁeld: unexpected jumps appeared in the ﬁeld representing the
diameter of the second group of bubbles, leading to signiﬁcant variations in forces and
resulting in void fraction gradients. This could be indicative of improper formulation or
numerical implementation of equations, or it might be related to an incompatibility with
other ﬁelds sharing information.
mFrom the turbulent dispersion force: the turbulent dispersion force could also play a role
in this problem, especially if the coeﬃcient associated turned out to be negative, which
would be unsuitable in this context.
mFrom the LIM (interface reconstruction method) activation criterion: another possible
factor is an issue related to the activation criterion of the LIM. This criterion determines
when large interfaces are present and choosing an inappropriate criterion could lead to
excessive activation in inappropriate zones.
The most obvious issue is the presence of a negative dispersion zones. There are two forces that
can be looked at in an attempt to modify the dispersion coeﬃcient: the drag force and the added
mass force. The drag force directly inﬂuences the characteristic time of the bubbles, while the
added mass force inﬂuences the weight of diﬀerent mechanisms. The drag force already provides
consistent results in other conﬁgurations in the literature and in various simulations carried out.
Therefore, the idea is to focus on the added mass force.
The coeﬃcient CAM=1
2is suitable for spherical or almost spherical bubbles. However, the
2nd group of bubbles is made of deformed bubbles that have way more resistance to its motion.
The added mass coeﬃcient is then underestimated and must be computed. However, no general
computation is available for any type of bubble of the second group. Then, we choose the model
used by Shen and Hibiki [113] for the second group. As depicted in Figure 3.22 We consider
a cap bubble, of small axis hwand half of the longer axis aw, with a wake angle θwof50◦-
typically the angle found in experiments. Then, its aspect ratio :
µw=hw
2aw=hw
2aw=1
21−cos(θw)
sinθw≈0.233. (3.38)
107Chapter 3 – New modeling and modiﬁcations based on channel ﬂow investigations

We then have the volume of the cap VΩcap=πa3

We have then :

Then according to the value found by Simcik an al. [117], we have :
CAM= 1.01f−0.416
shape≈2.83, (3.41)
for rigid cap bubbles and :
CAM= 1.13×10−5(180◦−θw)3−3.4×10−3(180◦−θw)2+0.356(180◦−θw)−11.9≈1.75,(3.42)
for deformable cap bubbles. We chose to use the last one because the ﬁrst result is too high.

The ﬁgure B.10 shows the evolution of GTD according αgandηrwith its new expression
for a cap bubble, with CAM= 1.75. It can be noticed the area of negative GTD is way smaller
and that in general the GTD for the cap bubble is close to the one for the spherical bubbles.
ForCAM= 1.75andηr= 0,αgmax≈0.192close to the maximum packing limit of αgmax≈0.2
used in [49] for squeezed cap bubbles in order to deduce a ﬂow regime transition criteria for
two-phase ﬂow in vertical annulus. In the case one would like to use 0.2exactly as cap-bubble
packing limit, the added mass coeﬃcient should be12
7≈1.71and soθw≈50.82◦.
To repair the appearance of diameter jumps due to strong dynamics, it is crucial to have a
repair and smoothing method. Indeed, we strongly constrain the diameter of group 2to prevent
its ﬁeld from reaching values outside the permissible range i.e. the range of group 1. The idea
to avoid excessive constraints is to introduce diﬀusion in the diameter ﬁelds. The original idea
from [51] is to add diﬀusion terms related to the average of the near-interface transport term in
the equation for ai.
In NEPTUNE _CFD, it is not aithat is solved, but rather Xg=ai
ρgαg. Therefore, we need to
modify this term to adapt to our resolution:
Dai
αg∇ai=ρgDai
αg(Xg∇αg+αg∇Xg) =ρgDai(Xg∇ln(αg) +∇Xg). (3.43)
We obtain two terms, one dependent on αgand the other on Xg. The ﬁrst term presents a
divergence issue when αg= 0and becomes dependent on the logarithm of the void fraction for
other cases. To address this, we choose to set its diﬀusion coeﬃcient to 0and neglect this term
in our equation. Consequently, we obtain a term identical to the one proposed by [51]. However,
this gives rise to the issue of modeling the diﬀusion term. It is suggested that Dai=KDsm|v/prime
l|,
withK=1
3. While this coeﬃcient Kis known to match experimental observations for bubbly
cases, it lacks suﬃcient justiﬁcation for straightforward application to group 2.
109Chapter 3 – New modeling and modiﬁcations based on channel ﬂow investigations
Therefore, ourobjectiveistounderstanditslikelyorigin. Thediﬀusioncoeﬃcientintheequation
should quantify the bubble’s ability to transfer its energy to ﬂuctuating structures. Thus, a
commonly used scale arises naturally, inspired by [24] for the turbulent diﬀusion, the time scale

We now have a velocity scale for energy transfers, CDUr, and a spatial scale of2

revisit the deﬁnition of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient, it can be expressed as the velocity ﬂuctuations
multiplied by the characteristic scale of energy transfers, which yields:
Dai=2

We haveK=2

spherical bubbles. For bubbles in group 2, we haveK=2
3×1.75≈1.167.
The ﬁnal issue concerns the criterion of the maximum allowable void fraction to transition
from dispersed to continuous modeling. This criterion is not yet based on any physical phe-
nomenon. Additionally, [60] demonstrated that the results did not provide insight into the true
inﬂuence of this parameter, and thus, no criterion exists to optimize it. Therefore, it is necessary
to identify the origin of this limit in order to assign a coherent value to it in the modeling pro-
cess. An aspect that appears to be gaining importance in the case of group 2is the added mass
eﬀect. To be more precise, the additional mass resulting from the presence of group 2bubbles
seems to exert signiﬁcant inﬂuence. In fact, [85] suggested an added mass eﬀect in the transition
from dispersed bubbles to slugs and their stability due to strong added mass force. Therefore,
investigating this eﬀect is pertinent since gas pockets are similar to slugs. For this purpose, we
can study an ideal scenario using the LIM perspective (interface reconstruction method). We
suppose a vertical one-dimensional dynamic channel to focus only on these 3cells, neglecting
wall eﬀects, turbulence and density ratio. We therefore want the transition from LIM in the
interface from a maximum value αgcdto retain the ﬂuid impulse of an idealized gas pocket,
taken from [85]. In other words, we want point out when the dispersed point of view is equal
to a mean cross-sectionnal point of view. This value should depend on the presence of gas both
groups.αgcdwill then be the void fraction before the LIM activation. α/prime
g2gives the void fraction
of the second group in the central cell. αgtotgives the total void fraction of gas in the central
cell. By continuity with the LIM we want continuity of the impulse in the cross-area :

Figure 3.24: Scheme of the diﬀerent activation of the continuous phases from the LIM point of
view.
Figure 3.24 illustrates the two principles of continuous model activation from the perspective
of the LIM. The conventional activation occurs through the void fraction gradient of Group 2.
However, this criterion alone is insuﬃcient to localize the activation zones of the continuous ﬁeld.
In fact, a maximum void fraction limit is also necessary. We can distinguish between two cases.
The ﬁrst case involves the emergence of large interfaces due to the average void fraction within
the section. This can be linked to the appearance of annular ﬂow within the section. The second
case involves the appearance of signiﬁcant interfaces concealed by the presence of Group 1. The
ﬁrst case is easily interpretable but more challenging to study since it is not directly linked to
any particular phenomenon that could be used to compute the limit. In contrary, the second
case may be associated with dynamics related to added mass. Therefore, this phenomenon
must manifest when the LIM fails to detect the gradient due to it being hidden within the void
fractions. Thus, we must consider that α/prime
g2=αg2cd. We then have :
αg1=1−αg2cd
1 +αg2cd. (3.49)
This limit will be strongly aﬀected by the value of CAM0. However, it can vary from 0 to 3
depending on the shape of the churn bubble according to the dispersion force. We choose to use
the maximum limit of 3. The equation is then :
31 + 2αg2cd
1−αg2cd(1−αgtot) =1
31−αg1
1−αgtot. (3.50)
Then by considering α/prime

This equation has 2 interesting solutions, a maximum αg2cdmaxand a minimum αg2cdmin. The
solutions are way too complex to be implemented in a code because it supposes the simpliﬁcation

This behavior is intriguing because according to Ishii and Hibiki [85] slug bubbles appear with
a void fraction around 0.8. It means that the model can handle the dynamical behavior of a
slug with the LIM model. The second value seems to be diﬃcult to interpret because it can not
be found in the literature. However, an explanation of its origins is given in the chapter on the
DIVA experiment and simulations by looking at data.
The same computation can be done by taking into account the density ratio within the added
mass coeﬃcient (from equation 3.12) and balance equation, so that equation 3.46 becomes :

There is no simple general form for the solution. For water-air, we get for the upper limit
αg2cdmax≈0.806and for the lower limit αg2cdmin≈0.247. It is then a good approximation
to use the previous correlation as it is the result of a simpler equation. However, for a SG
mixγ≈10, the upper limit is αg2cdmax≈0.668and for the lower limit αg2cdmin≈0.290. It
means that in this case, the upper limit should be modiﬁed to take into account the density ratio.

In this chapter, we focused on the foundational modeling used to replicate two-phase ﬂows in the
presence of an obstacle. In the initial part, we highlighted the contribution and signiﬁcance of
turbulence models in relation to TRITON modeling. Notably, we emphasized their good perfor-
mance in reproducing observed trends in void fraction and averaged liquid velocity, particularly
with the EBRSM and EBRSM+LI models.
The next part dealt with the modiﬁcation necessary for the modeling. We identiﬁed issues aris-
ing from the presence of the obstacle, such as increased void fraction, aﬀecting various aspects
of the modeling. Proposed modiﬁcations included adjustments to the drag and added mass
coeﬃcients, the turbulent dispersion force, some source terms in the transport of interfacial
113Chapter 3 – New modeling and modiﬁcations based on channel ﬂow investigations
area concentration, and the modeling of pseudo-turbulence. The last part focused on a distinct
modeling approach for the deformed bubbles in group 2, motivated by poor numerical results.
We presented considerations regarding the added mass coeﬃcient, introducing a signiﬁcant dif-
ference in dynamics for added mass and turbulent dispersion forces, for the source terms of
interfacial area concentration, and the transition criterion to shift to annular or churn regimes,
where statistical dispersed modeling is no longer able to represent more chaotic interfaces eﬀec-
tively.
Now that modiﬁcations have been introduced to address the primary modeling challenges, it is
necessary to return to a conﬁguration with an obstacle to check if the model is able to reproduce
two-phase ﬂows around a cylinder before moving on to the DIVA conﬁguration. This is the
focus of the next chapter.

4.1 Sensitivity of the TRITON model
4.1.1 Numerical tools
NEPTUNE_CFD is a software platform for advanced two-phase ﬂows simulation involving the
CEA, EDF, IRSN and Framatome. The extension used is the two-ﬂuid model [85] with one
unique pressure ﬁeld for the two-phases. Among else, it can deal with unsteady turbulent bub-
bly ﬂows[119].
The numerical approach is based on a ﬁnite-volume co-located cell-centered approach and a
"alpha-pressure-energy cycle" solver at ﬁrst order in time based on a pressure correction frac-
tional step method with an iterative coupling between energy and mass balance equations that
ensures the conservation of mass and energy. A complete description of NEPTUNE_CFD’s
numerical methods is proposed by E.Kuidjo Kuidjo in [60]. A short version of the algorithm is
proposed after from a step n to the step n+1 with a criterion on the convergence jmax:

mEnd of cycle if jmaxreached or axiom of continuity get minor value otherwise j=j+ 1.
An upwind second-order scheme is used for the convective schemes of every variable, except
when the LIM is activated we must use a ﬁrst order because the higher order can damage the
prediction of the interface.
Inlets are computed with ﬂat proﬁles of constant speed, volume fraction, turbulent intensity and
Sauter Mean Diameter( Dsm). Outlets are computed with no back-ﬂow conditions and imposed
pressure condition. For 2D calculation, symmetric conditions can be imposed on some bound-
aries. For walls, a weak no-slip condition is imposed to allow the determination of the velocity
gradient with the turbulent variables. The Van Driest analysis is used to obtain the velocity
gradient for the high Reynolds turbulence models :

general.

Post-processing for the spectra requires retrieving pressure and viscous shear information
at each of the calculated time steps. The calculations are performed using an unsteady solver
with adaptive time stepping. However, for the purpose of measuring forces, the experiment is
conducted at a ﬁxed time step of 0.0019531 seconds. The method for obtaining force spectra
requires a constant time step and is sensitive to it. As a result, each of the simulated signals,
which has a time step always smaller than that of the experiment, is re-sampled at the ex-
perimental time step using quadratic interpolation. Additionally, force spectra are sensitive to
the simulation duration and the options used. To address the ﬁrst issue, the analysis can be
performed over diﬀerent durations to ensure statistical convergence. Empirically, it is necessary
to have at least 10,000experimental time steps and 100time steps characteristic of the stud-
ied dynamics, excluding the "transient" period. To overcome post-processing issues, the raw
experimental signal undergoes the same post-processing as the simulated signal.
4.1.2 On the mesh sensitivity in single phase ﬂow
The prospects of obtaining meaningful quantitative results regarding the force spectra repro-
duction on the central cylinder of the tube bundle rely on the outcomes presented in [130].
Indeed, simulations employing various URANS approaches and hybrid URANS-LES approaches
were conducted in a single-phase scenario on the DIVA conﬁguration. The results reveal that
the shapes of the power spectral densities from the numerical simulation and the experiment
are quite similar. Although energy levels are occasionally slightly over or underestimated, the
rates of energy decay are of the same order of magnitude. It has also been highlighted that
the predictions from two-dimensional simulations are relatively accurate. However, an essential
aspect we aim to verify in this section is if the meshing strategy is suitable for the numerical
model and to justify the interpretability of graphs concerning 2Dmesh convergence, as well as
the contribution of 3Din a single-phase scenario.
This thesis exclusively focuses on pseudo 2Dcases (a single cell in the tube direction) with
tubes, rather than encompassing scenarios that take into account 3Deﬀects. First, there exists
no means to ensure the accuracy of the physics in this direction, as there is a lack of experimental
investigation on this aspect for two-phase ﬂows. Secondly, DIVA supposes using wall boundary
conditions on each side of the tube, making it challenging to quantify the actual inﬂuence of
these boundaries. Additionally, even when considering a segment of the experiment and im-
posing symmetry conditions, it remains diﬃcult to conclude on the true symmetries of the ﬂow
and assess the impact of symmetry on the 3Dstructures. Furthermore, the continuous inter-
face reconstruction method (LIM) has undergone limited testing in complex 3Dcases involving
tubes, raising doubts about its eﬃciency in replicating 3Dstructures along the tube’s direction.
In addition, an assessment of the mesh count necessary for a coarse 3Dcalculation, conducted
through tests on one-third of the geometry (approximately 3 tube diameters), has underscored
the requirement for a mesh containing at least three billion elements. Consequently, the beneﬁts
of performing 3Dsimulations in terms of computational time and energy consumption for the
intended application is limited.
We now focus on a channel geometry with a single tube with diameter Dof0.03m, of depth
10D, length 6D, and height 16Denclosed by walls. In the 2Dconﬁguration, there is only one
mesh layer in the depth because NEPTUNE_CFD is a 3D code, whereas the 3Dconﬁguration
117Chapter 4 – Simulations of two-phase ﬂows around a cylinder
covers 7Din the depth. We set a boundary condition at the inlet with a velocity plateau of
Ul= 0.74m/s, corresponding to a Reynolds number of 22200. We tested six diﬀerent meshes,
three for the 2Dcase ( 20,000,70,000and150,000cells), and three for the 3D(under-resolved)
case( 350,000,700,000and1,400,000cells),categorizedasCoarse,Medium,andFine. Thecom-
plete TRITON model is used with αg1= 0,αg2= 0,Dsm1= 10−6m, andDsm2= 10.8×10−3m.

Lforces exerted on the tube. Regarding the Strouhal number, all cases
have an error above 9%. None of the simulations yield an exact result, but they provide a good
estimation. This is because the conﬁnement eﬀects can be signiﬁcant in numerical simulations
compared to experiments, inducing an overestimation of the increase of velocity and so shifting
the frequency. However the error in the frequency is acceptable for all cases. Regarding the
standard deviations of drag C/prime
D, all cases have an error above 20%, with a minimum for the 2D
ﬁne case. Regarding the standard deviations of lift C/prime
L, the error is minimum ( 6%) for the 3D
ﬁne case and maximum ( 420%) for the 2Dﬁne case. As for the standard deviations, the 2D
simulations seem to perform better for drag, while the 3Dsimulations tend to underestimate it.
Conversely, the error in the standard deviation of lift C/prime
Lis much better for the 3Dcase. This
is because obtaining an accurate lift standard deviation is challenging due to the conﬁnement
eﬀect, which is mitigated in 3D. However, obtaining a good standard deviation value for drag

(left) and 3D(right) compared to experimental data (red) according to the frequency. Simulated
with TRITON model.
Figures 4.1 depicts the lift (top) and drag (bottom) force spectra exerted on the cylinder
for both 2D(left) and 3D(right) meshes compared to experimental data (red) according to
the frequency. According to the graphs, the experimental lift spectrum (top) exhibits a sharp
increase between 2.5Hz and 5.4Hz, featuring a characteristic peak indicative of Von Karman
alleys (Strouhal number of St=fD
Ul= 0.22). It then decreases signiﬁcantly until around 7.4Hz,
with a slight peak at 16.3Hz (Strouhal number of 0.66 = 3∗0.22), followed by a steady decline
up to 40Hz. Getting St= 0.22and the third harmonic is a charateristic of the lift spectrum
with Von Karman alleys for single cylinder conﬁguration. On the other hand, the experimental
drag spectrum (bottom), initially remains relatively constant between 2.5Hz and 10Hz, with
a peak at 5.2Hz (St= 0.21). It then maintains near-constant behavior until around 10.9Hz
(St= 0.44), after it decreases up to 45Hz. Getting St= 0.22and the second harmonic is a
carateristic of the drag spectrum with Von Karman alleys for single cylinder conﬁguration.
In the 2Dlift graph (top-left), we observe a convergence of spectra with ﬁner mesh resolution.
There is also a frequency shift, as previously noted in the table 4.1. Focusing on the ﬁne mesh,
we notice substantial growth between 2.7Hz and 6.9Hz (St= 0.28), followed by a steep decline
until around 200Hz, after which it decreases with two peaks at 11Hz (St= 0.44) and 20.9Hz
119Chapter 4 – Simulations of two-phase ﬂows around a cylinder
(St= 0.85≈0.28∗3). Even though noticeable diﬀerences exist compared to the experimental
data, it is interesting to note that we achieve a behavior similar to the experimental results.
Regarding the 3Dlift graph (top-right), we can observe a more diﬃcult convergence of spectra
with the mesh resolution. However, there is a less signiﬁcant frequency shift compared to the
2D case. This phenomenon is likely due to the 3Deﬀects that mitigate accelerations. Focusing
on the ﬁne mesh spectrum, we notice a very strong peak spanning three orders of magnitude,
extending from 2.5Hz to 14Hz, with a maximum around 5.9Hz (St= 0.24). A second peak is
observed around 17Hz (St= 0.69≈0.24∗3), with a very steep decline. It becomes obvious that
the 3D behavior is quite diﬀerent from the experimental behavior. Indeed, turbulence models
like EBRSM are not able to adequately accounting for 3Deﬀects, which is obvious from this
graph. The 2D calculation, despite its sensitivity to conﬁnement accelerations, is more interest-
ing from a physics point of view than the 3D calculation.
In the 2Ddrag graph (bottom-left), we observe a convergence of spectra with ﬁner mesh reso-
lution. There is also a frequency shift, as previously noted in the table. Focusing on the ﬁne
mesh spectrum, we notice substantial growth between 3.8Hz and 5.4Hz, with a maximum at
4.7Hz (St= 0.19), followed by a steep decline until around 10Hz, after which it decreases
gradually with a peak at 14Hz (St= 0.56). Even though noticeable diﬀerences exist compared
to the experimental data, it is interesting to note that we achieve a behavior similar to the
experimental results.
Looking at the 3Ddrag graph, we can also observe a convergence of spectra with the mesh
resolution. However, there is a less signiﬁcant frequency shift compared to the 2D case. This
phenomenon is likely due to the 3Deﬀects that mitigate accelerations. Focusing on the ﬁne
mesh spectrum, we notice a sharp decline between 2Hz and 7Hz, followed by a very strong
peak spanning two orders of magnitude, extending from 8Hz to 14Hz, with a maximum around
11.5Hz (St= 0.47). Afterward, there is a very steep decline. As with lift, it becomes evident
that the 3D behavior of drag is quite diﬀerent from the experimental behavior.
Although the spectra do not completely overlap, a similar frequency distribution is clearly
discernible. Additionally, despite diﬀerent standard deviations, the distributions of frequency in
2Dand experiments are quite similar. Therefore, the contribution of the 3Dsimulations appears
to be somewhat redundant. Indeed, reproducing 3Deﬀects like separation is challenging, and
despite an overestimation in the lift standard deviation, the 2Dsimulations yield interesting
results.
To summarize, TRITON model may not be the best URANS model, however, it still gives
appealing results concerning the force spectra, without adjustable parameters. The next step is
to understand the sensitivity of the spectra to the injection conditions. These conditions tend
to lead to a speciﬁc ﬂow topology that subsequently inﬂuences the graphs. This is the focus of
the following section.
4.1.3 On the eﬀect of injection conditions on the force spectra
In order to analyze and understand the predictive capabilities of the model, the diﬃculty of ob-
taining good results and to be able to draw clear conclusions, we are interested in the sensitivity
of the model response to the conditions of operating injection. We are interested in a classic
bubbly test case in single tube conﬁguration. As a reminder, the experimental setup is com-
posed of an upward channel of 0.18×0.3m2rectangular section in which can be set a horizontal
tube of diameter 0.03m. The operating conditions are deﬁned by a liquid superﬁcial velocity
jl= 0.25m/s and a gas superﬁcial velocity jg= 0.082m/s. The ﬂow is then characterized by
a void fraction αg= 0.247and a liquid Reynolds Rel= 7500. A mesh convergence study was
performed on several meshes and a satisfying convergence was obtained with a general mesh size
120Chapter 4 – Simulations of two-phase ﬂows around a cylinder
of0.066mm and a ﬁrst wall cell satisfying y+≈0.8.
The investigation focuses on the sensitivity of the injected void fraction for group 1 and mean
Sauter diameter. The sensitivity analysis was performed with injected diameters, but because
it draws the same conclusions we focus only on 2diﬀerent ones. Here, we decide to choose
5cases representative of the sensitivity of the spectra. Consequently, we look at simulations
withαg1∈{0.247,0.183,0.072}and ﬁrst group diameter Dsm1∈{2,4}mm. The operating
conditions of this study are summarized in Table 4.2.

Figures 4.2 shows the lift (top) and drag (bottom) spectra, respectively, from the sensitiv-
ity study of the distribution of the void fraction between the two groups for a liquid Reynolds
number of 7500and a homogeneous void fraction of 0.247.
According to Figure 4.2, the experimental lift spectrum exhibits a nearly plateau-like behavior
between 1Hz and 6Hz, followed by a decrease towards the cutoﬀ frequency. The two spectra
with group 1void fractions of 0.247and0.072and a ﬁrst group diameter of 4mm also exhibit
a plateau-like trend between 1Hz and 30Hz, with then a slight decline until the cutoﬀ fre-
quency. However, the spectra corresponding to αg1= 0.183sharply increase between 1Hz and
2.6Hz before steeply decreasing to 6Hz, indicating shear close to the cylinder. They continue
to decrease until the cutoﬀ frequency. The case with αg1= 0.072andDsm1= 2mm, exhibits
a nearly plateau-like behavior between 1Hz and 5Hz with two peaks around 1Hz and 4.1Hz,
122Chapter 4 – Simulations of two-phase ﬂows around a cylinder
it slightly decreases until 6Hz and is then almost constant until the cutoﬀ frequency. None of
these simulations appear to accurately replicate the experimental lift.
According to Figure 4.2, the experimental drag spectrum exhibits a sharp decrease between 1
Hz and 5Hz, followed by a slight upward trend just after 10Hz, before ultimately declining
until the cutoﬀ frequency. The two spectra with Group 1void fractions of 0.247and0.072and
Dsm1= 4mm both display a plateau-like trend between 1Hz, with a slight decline starting
around 30Hz until the cutoﬀ frequency. The spectra corresponding to αg1= 0.183show a sim-
ilar trend, except for a slight bump around 5Hz, while the trend of the case with αg1= 0.072
andDsm1= 2mm has the same trend. None of these simulations appear to accurately replicate
the experimental drag.
Indeed, among all the simulations conducted, none have accurately reproduced the force
spectra, even when modifying furthermore various parts of the all-regime model. From the sim-
ulations presented in the introduction, it becomes obvious that the spectra are highly sensitive
to the ﬂow topology around the cylinder, particularly the shear that aﬀects the position and
shape of the cluster at the rear of the cylinder. Consequently, single-phase turbulence plays a
crucial role in replicating the spectra. However, it is important to note that the proposed model
is far less sensitive to injection conditions than the basic model. Notably, we obtain reasonable
orders of magnitude for the ﬂuctuations. To assess the inﬂuence of turbulence, it is possible to
activate pseudo-turbulence (LI) in the case with only one group i.e. αg1= 0.247. The results of
the ﬂuctuations are summarized in the following table.

Table 4.3 gives the standard deviations of the lift and drag forces for the experiment, for the
simulations with and without pseudo-turbulence (LI). The use of pseudo-turbulence (LI) has
signiﬁcantly altered the magnitude of ﬂuctuations. It completely changes the ﬂow topology by
introducing turbulent intensity, particularly around the stagnation point. This eﬀect tends to
create very strong turbulence and unsteady void fraction gradients. Therefore, it is advisable
not to use this option, as it appears to be incompatible with the presence of an obstacle. Further
investigations are necessary to account for those eﬀects. Hence, it becomes crucial to understand
what truly inﬂuences the experimental and numerical force spectra. To achieve this, the next
section focuses on experimental spectra to identify the inﬂuencing parameters of the spectra.
Subsequent studies will examine cases with diﬀerent ﬂow topologies based on Reynolds number
and ﬂow regime to understand what inﬂuences the numerical spectra.

to identify the primary factors inﬂuencing these force spectra. Initially, we analyze experimental
123Chapter 4 – Simulations of two-phase ﬂows around a cylinder
results to draw initial conclusions, followed by simulations using the model to verify if similar
observations can be obtained.
4.2.1 In experiments
A study of a single-cylinder cross two-phase ﬂow case can be found in [94]. The study was con-
ducted on the lift force with a diameter of 0.01215m - as opposed to 0.03m in this study - and
for homogeneous void fractions ranging from 30%to95%and liquid Reynolds numbers ranging
from 3.5×104to2.8×106. Their study notably showed that the low-frequency components
increase with void fraction, while the decay slopes decrease more rapidly. It demonstrates that
for local void fractions between 11%and20%, the spectra increases with void fraction, and
the graphs appear to collapse for local void fractions above 40%- no measurements were taken
between 20%and40%.
Since the single-tube experiment was conducted before DIVA, we don’t have access to the
method - described in section 5.1.1- for identifying the ﬂow regime. However, since the single-
tube experiment and DIVA share identical characteristics, comparing the injection maps allows
us to predict a map of regimes for classifying the spectra. The greatest uncertainty arises in the
identiﬁcation of cap-bubbly regimes compared to churn because they exhibit similar spectra.
However, as annular and bubbly regimes are easily identiﬁable, we can have greater conﬁdence
in their identiﬁcation.
Figures 4.3 and 4.4 depict force spectra – drag (bottom) and lift (top) - for liquid Reynolds
numbers of 7500and15000respectively with regime identiﬁcation from section 5.1.1. Regarding
the lift spectra (top), it is obvious that all the graphs exhibit a decreasing trend between 10
Hz and 200Hz, which becomes more pronounced after 20Hz forRel= 7500. Notably, there
is a clear collapse of curves for cap-bubbly and churn regimes, while bubbly regimes appear to
be more spread out. It is noticeable that the curves mainly align with increasing void fraction,
except for the annular case. This trend can be explained by the quasi-absence of liquid. In this
scenario, predominantly gas-phase behavior is likely observed. Therefore, it appears that the
lift spectra depend on the Reynolds number as well as the ﬂow regime, whether it is bubbly,
cap-bubbly/churn, or annular. The increase in ﬂuctuations with void fraction in the bubbly
regime, followed by its stagnation in the cap-bubbly/churn regime, suggests that the overall
level of ﬂuctuations likely depends primarily on the small bubble dynamics and by changing of
regime on the presence of larger structures. The balance introduced by the presence of larger
structures such as cap bubbles or gas pockets tends to dampen ﬂuctuations until the system
becomes predominantly gaseous. Consequently, achieving accurate results in the bubbly regime
is challenging, as it relies on bubble ﬂuctuation phenomena that are not modeled, unlike in the
cap-bubbly/churn regime where the presence of large structures stabilizes the ﬂow, making it
less sensitive to small bubble ﬂuctuations.
Regarding the drag spectra, there is a consistent decreasing trend starting at around 20Hz,
with a change in slope occurring around 70Hz. In contrast to the lift, there is no observable
spectrum collapse at a speciﬁc void fraction, but rather an increase in amplitude with increasing
void fraction. Additionally, it appears that the decay slopes also increase with void fraction.
Although the curves between Reynolds numbers are quite similar, it seems that drag is less
sensitive to liquid Reynolds number variations than lift. However, the limited dataset does not
allow for broader conclusions across all Reynolds numbers. Nevertheless, there is a signiﬁcant
variability in spectrum with respect to void fraction. It will likely be more challenging to
obtain accurate results for drag force spectra as void fraction appears to be the most inﬂuential
parameter. However, it is noticeable that the Reynolds number has a more signiﬁcant impact

on the bubbly regime than on other regimes. Achieving this variability in our simulations seems
more complex. Therefore, obtaining good results in the cap-bubbly/churn regime might be
easier than in the bubbly regime.
It appears, therefore, that the variability of the graphs depends on the liquid Reynolds number
and the void fraction, particularly in relation to the ﬂow regimes. It appears that the bubbly
regime is more sensitive to the liquid Reynolds number and void fraction than other regimes.
Obtaining accurate results in the bubbly regime might be more challenging. This could be
explained by a greater inﬂuence of bubble-related ﬂuctuations in the bubbly case, which are
then mitigated by the presence of large structures within the ﬂow and the lower proportion
of water. To test this hypothesis numerically, the next sections will focus on the bubbly and
cap-bubbly/churn cases.

4.2.2 Bubbly ﬂows simulations
Comparative data involving a single cylinder is relatively rare. Moreover, merely aligning with
a speciﬁc experiment is not suﬃcient to establish that the model, even if it accurately predicts
all conﬁgurations, is able to capture the underlying physics. Particularly, our focus lies in
the qualitative observations given by Inoue et al.[44]. Indeed, a problem arose regarding the
reproduction of single-cylinder bubbly ﬂows. The CEA experiment allows comparison of the
forces spectra experienced by the cylinder, but no local data within the ﬂow is available. In
contrast, [44] provides qualitative and quantitative data on the ﬂow without having the spectra.
However, the experiments conducted at CEA are limited. We have data from experiments
conducted with comparable liquid Reynolds numbers but often very diﬀerent void fractions.
However, it has been observed that force spectra are primarily sensitive to the liquid Reynolds
126Chapter 4 – Simulations of two-phase ﬂows around a cylinder
number and less to the void fraction (the overall spectrum shifts slightly upwards with the void
fraction). Therefore, we can still use experimental data on the spectra as a reference to compare,
at a lower cost, the experiments conducted at CEA and those of [44] with our simulations. An
essential aspect of validation is the model’s response to the liquid Reynolds number, aiming
to replicate the various structures observed in the experimental setup. Thus, we intend to
undertake a qualitative comparison between the experimental setup and the simulation results,
subsequently extracting more quantitative insights. The operational conditions for this study
are summarized in the Table 4.4.

Table 4.4: Table of the conditions of the study of single cylinder conﬁguration in bubbly regime.
As a reminder, Inoue et al.[44] observed that the area near the separation point produces
high local void fraction 3 to 4 times the homogeneous volume fraction. A high void fraction area
is located behind the cylinder. As the liquid velocity increases, its void fraction peak increases
and its position comes closer to the cylinder. A liquid layer where bubbles can hardly penetrate
can be produced in the front and in the rear of the cylinder due to the static pressure gradient.
Its thickness respectively increases and decreases in the front and in the rear with increasing
ﬂow velocity.
127Chapter 4 – Simulations of two-phase ﬂows around a cylinder
Figure 4.5: Qualitative comparison between simulations (top, instantaneous void fraction), with
D= 30mm and [44] (bottom), with D= 20mm, with increasing Reynolds number from left to

Figure 4.5 displays images of the ﬂow from Inoue et al.[44] (bottom) and simulation results
of the experiment (top, instantaneous void fraction) with increasing Reynolds number from left
to right. The conditions are summarized in the Table 4.4. Clear observations can be made
from Inoue et al.’s photos. There is a region close to the cylinder where bubbles concentrate,
causing an increase in void fraction. For the lowest Reynolds number (bottom-left), a cluster of
bubbles can be seen at the rear, which is later sheared, and an area where bubbles cannot pass
through. As the liquid velocity increases (bottom-middle), the cluster spreads out, the shearing
occurs farther from the cylinder, and the upstream region near the stagnation point appears to
start pushing the bubbles back. With further increases in velocity (bottom-right), the cluster
continues to spread and is sheared even farther away. The upstream region pushing the bubbles
becomes more evident, while the cluster moves closer to the cylinder.
Now, looking at the simulations, for the lowest Reynolds number (top-left), we see the presence
of a clustered zone being sheared close to the cylinder. A high void fraction zone can also be
observed around the cylinder, associated with lubrication forces and pressure that is not strong
enough to repel the gas phase. As we increase the liquid velocity, we obtain a larger clustered
zone that is sheared farther away from the cylinder. We also notice the disappearance of the high
128Chapter 4 – Simulations of two-phase ﬂows around a cylinder
void fraction zone close to the wall in favor of the pressure, which begins to dominate and push
the gas phase away. Subsequently, with a further increase in liquid Reynolds number, we ob-
serve the presence of a region where there is no gas upstream of the cylinder due to the pressure
around the stagnation point. There is also the presence of an elongated tail of the cluster, which
is sheared farther away. Thus, we qualitatively obtain zones where the void fraction increases
signiﬁcantly around the cylinder, clusters whose positions change with velocity upstream and
downstream in a manner consistent with the experiment.
It appears that the liquid Reynolds number is a key parameter inﬂuencing the ﬂow topology
around the cylinder in simulations with TRITON. Therefore, one can expect that the position
of the cluster and the distribution of void fraction around the cylinder will have a signiﬁcant
impact on the prediction of drag and lift forces.

Figure 4.6 shows the spectra of drag forces (left) and lift forces (right) for simulations with
Reynolds numbers of 9940(top), 19880(middle), and 39760(bottom), compared to our experi-
mental data with the same Reynolds numbers, but with diﬀerent injected void fractions.
Looking at the lift graph for the Reynolds number of 9940(top-left), the experimental spectrum
exhibits a low-amplitude bump between 1Hz and 3Hz, followed by a second bump between 3
129Chapter 4 – Simulations of two-phase ﬂows around a cylinder
Hz and 10Hz, and then a decrease towards the cutoﬀ frequency. In contrast, the simulation
shows a slight increase between 3Hz and 5Hz, followed by a mainly ﬂat response up to the
cutoﬀ frequency, with a small bump between 1.3Hz and 3.1Hz. This frequency appears to be
related to the inability of the lubrication force to push back the gas phase due to insuﬃcient
pressure. Examining the corresponding drag spectrum (top-right), the experimental data reveal
a decrease up to 5Hz, then a relatively constant behavior, with two bumps at 7.6Hz and 11
Hz, before decreasing again towards 20Hz. The frequency of 11 Hz could stem from the natural
frequency of the ﬂow (jl+jg
D= 0.332/0.03≈11Hz). In contrast, the simulated graph remains
mainly constant up to the cutoﬀ frequency. Consequently, this simulation has not accurately
reproduced the random force spectra. Notably, the presence of this plateau and the absence
of high-frequency decrease seem to originate from the artiﬁcially created region near the wall
due to the lubrication force. The modeling of lubrication for a single cylinder appears to be
potentially detrimental, as it can induce a particular ﬂow topology around the cylinder. Thus,
the ﬂow topology near the wall seems to have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the prediction of the
spectrum. To get deeper understanding, we can explore spectra at higher Reynolds numbers,
which exhibit very diﬀerent ﬂow topologies.
Looking at the lift graph for the Reynolds number of 19880(middle-left), the experimental
spectrum shows a sharp increase between 1Hz and 2Hz, followed by a decrease to 7Hz, and
then a change in slope before gradually decreasing with a constant slope up to the cutoﬀ fre-
quency. Considering the natural frequency of the ﬂow ( fflow=jg+jl
D= 22Hz), it appears that
2Hz is related to the formation of structures around the cylinder. In contrast, the simulation
exhibits a slight increase between 1Hz and 2Hz, followed by a decrease to 7Hz, and then a
decrease with a signiﬁcant change in slope. This demonstrates a qualitatively similar behavior
to the experimental data. However, the standard deviation of the lift (area under the curve)
is lower than in the experimental results. Indeed, it was observed experimentally that an in-
crease in void fraction leads to an elevation of the spectra. Thus, its low position indicates an
underestimated value. Turning to the experimental drag spectrum (middle-right), we observe
growth between 1Hz and 3Hz, followed by a decrease to 5.2Hz. Subsequently, it increases
with the presence of two peaks at 8Hz and 11Hz before decreasing again towards the cutoﬀ
frequency. Those frequencies are comparable to bubble frequencies, but not to the frequency of
the mean ﬂow itself ( fflow). The simulated spectrum exhibits two broad peaks in the range of
1Hz to 5Hz, with one peak at 2.1Hz, due to the structures behind the tube. It then presents
two peaks of comparable amplitudes at 6Hz and 10Hz before decreasing towards the cutoﬀ
frequency. Similar to the lift, we qualitatively obtain a similar frequency distribution, but at a
much lower level. This behavior can be attributed to the pressure zone pushing back the gas
phase and the cluster at the rear of the cylinder being too distant. In this case, we would obtain
lower standard deviations that aﬀect the overall spectrum level without signiﬁcantly altering the
frequency distribution of random forces. To conﬁrm this, we can study the highest Reynolds
number.
If we look at the experimental lift spectrum for the Reynolds number of 30000(bottom-left),
we observe a plateau until 4Hz and a peak at 6Hz (maybe linked to structures behind the
tube), ranging from 3Hz to 11Hz, before gradually decreasing with a constant slope up to the
cutoﬀ frequency. In contrast, the simulated spectrum increases between 1Hz and 2.4Hz, then
decreases to 10Hz with a peak at 6Hz, due to the structures behind the tube, before gradually
decreasing with a constant slope. We can clearly see a similar behavior, but with a spectrum
level that is too low. Similarly, if we look at the experimental drag spectrum (bottom-right),
we observe a mainly ﬂat level between 2Hz and 20Hz, with three peaks at 3Hz,9Hz, and 11
130Chapter 4 – Simulations of two-phase ﬂows around a cylinder
Hz. These last two frequencies are related to bubble frequencies, not to the mean ﬂow (with a
natural frequency of 44Hz). The simulated graph shows a decreasing trend between 1Hz and
10Hz, with peaks at 1.9Hz and 6Hz, before gradually decreasing with a constant slope. We
ﬁnd drag spectra with similarities, but at a much lower level.
As a reminder, increasing the void fraction only raises the overall force spectra. The diﬀer-
enceinvoidfractionbetweentheexperimentandthesimulationdoesnotexplainthediscrepancy
in the spectra or could solve the problem. Therefore, we can conclude that the upstream area
near the cylinder, potentially having a single-phase region, as well as the distance of the clus-
ter from the cylinder, are topological factors of signiﬁcance in accurately reproducing the force
spectra. It also appears that the frequencies related to bubble passage are not captured. This
is not surprising since their presence is given as an average, and the ﬂuctuations due to their
intermittency are not reproduced in the model. However, these areas are sensitive to:
1. The injection diameter, which identiﬁes if repulsion occurs via lubrication and also con-
strains the velocity ﬁeld through near-wall drag.
2. The velocity proﬁle, which establishes the balance between the phases and the shearing at
the rear of the cylinder. This velocity is also inﬂuenced by the walls that conﬁne the ﬂow.
3. Turbulence, which aﬀects the ﬂow topology around the cylinder as well as ﬂuctuations and
did not yield perfect results in single-phase simulations.
These factors collectively contribute to the complexity of the problem and the challenges in-
volved in accurately simulating the force spectra.
The basic model from NEPTUNE_CFD yielded results that were highly sensitive to inlet condi-
tions, often diverging signiﬁcantly from experimental data, making it unreliable for predictions.
While our model does not provide perfect results, it is less sensitive to input conditions and
more reliable in reproducing the trends observed in force spectra. However, these spectra tend
tounderestimatetheoverallmagnitudecomparedtoexperimentaldata. Thisaspectisintriguing
considering the various assumptions and models that are not perfect even in academic cases. We
also notice variability in standard deviations and results, which appears to stem from deﬁciencies
in modeling and/or balancing the regions near the stagnation point and shear. Nevertheless,
the conﬁned nature of the experiment does not make it easy to perfectly replicate experimental
topologies. However, these results oﬀer hope for improving models. Additionally, these criti-
cal areas will be locally constrained by the cylinders in DIVA. This will enable us to identify
whether the issues primarily stem from modeling, as the clusters and upstream and downstream
recirculation lengths will be constrained by the upstream and downstream cylinders, or if they
mainly result from the diﬃculty in obtaining the correct topologies and distances upstream and
downstream of the cylinder. Another aspect to verify is the improvement of the spectra with
more group 2bubbles because the experimental spectra seem to show less sensitivity to the
liquid Reynolds number in the cap-bubbly/churn regimes. Therefore, in the next section, we
focus on cap-bubbly/churn simulations.
4.2.3 Cap-bubbly and churn ﬂows simulations
In this section, we focus on examining the inﬂuence of the Reynolds number for cap-bubbly and
churn regimes. Indeed, experimental comparisons can be conducted using the gathered data.
We want to verify the experimental observations. We investigate three liquid Reynolds number
cases: 7500,15000, and 30000for approximately homogeneous void fractions of about 0.64.

establish accurate inlet conditions. Furthermore, DIVA’s experimental setup is identical to the
single tube conﬁguration, providing additional justiﬁcation for its relevance in determining inlet
conditions. The methodology used to derive these inlet conditions for DIVA is accessible in the
subsequent chapter 5. Analyzing experimental data for conditions similar to the proposed ones
has given data for the inlet conditions. Assuming this similarity, speciﬁc inlet conditions were

Figure 4.7 shows the spectra of drag forces (right) and lift forces (left) for simulations with
liquid Reynolds numbers of 7500(top), 15000(middle), and 30000(bottom), compared to ex-
perimental data.
Looking at the Lift graph for the Reynolds number of 7500(top-left), the experimental spectrum
exhibits a plateau like behavior between 0.2Hz and 10Hz with two low-amplitude bumps at 1
Hz and 6Hz, followed by a decrease towards the cutoﬀ frequency. In contrast, the simulation
shows a slight increase between 1Hz and 5.1Hz (due to the injection of group 2bubbles),
followed by a decrease up to the cutoﬀ frequency, with a small bump at 20Hz. Examining the
corresponding drag spectrum (top-right), the experimental data reveal an increase between 1
Hz and 4Hz, followed by a decrease up to the cutoﬀ frequency. This frequency around 4Hz,
visible for all Reynolds numbers in both simulations and experiments, appears to be character-
istic of this regime and thus indicative of the presence of large gas structures. In contrast, the
133Chapter 4 – Simulations of two-phase ﬂows around a cylinder
simulated graph increases between 1Hz and 4Hz, then decreases to 11Hz, with a bump at 10
Hz before remaining mainly constant up to the cutoﬀ frequency. Consequently, this simulation
has better reproduced the random force spectra than in bubbly ﬂow. However, the lift standard
deviation seems to be over-predicted. This behavior can be caused by the acceleration due to
the conﬁnement and by the velocity ﬁeld of group 2impacting the cylinder. It seems that the
second group has a beneﬁcial eﬀect on the prediction of the force spectra.
Looking at the lift graph for the Reynolds number of 15000(middle-left), the experimental
spectrum shows a plateau-like behavior between 1Hz and 4Hz, followed by a bump at 7Hz
and then decreases with a constant slope up to the cutoﬀ frequency, with a bump at 18Hz. In
contrast, the simulation exhibits an increase between 1Hz and 4Hz, followed by a decrease to 7
Hz, then has a plateau-like behavior until 11Hz followed by a decrease at 18Hz before decreas-
ing with a signiﬁcant change in slope. This demonstrates a qualitatively similar behavior to the
experimental data. However, the standard deviation of the lift (area under the curve) is higher
than in the experimental results. Regarding the experimental drag spectrum (middle-right), we
observe growth between 1Hz and 4Hz, followed by a decrease towards the cutoﬀ frequency. The
simulated spectrum exhibits an increase between 1Hzand2Hz, followed by a ﬁrst decrease
until 13Hz before changing of slope with a bump at 19Hz. Similar to the lift, we do not obtain
a perfect simulated graph, but we qualitatively obtain a similar frequency distribution, but at
a much lower level. This behavior could be attributed to a better reproduction of the topology
around the cylinder. This case has the highest void fraction for group 2and appears to have
the best results regarding the force spectra, aligning with experimental observations.
If we look at the experimental lift spectrum for the Reynolds number of 30000(bottom-
left), we observe an increase between 1Hz and 10Hz, with a bump at 5Hz, followed by a
decrease with a constant slope up to the cutoﬀ frequency. In contrast, the simulated spectrum
increases between 1Hz and 10Hz, with a bump at 2Hz, then exhibits a bump at 18Hz then
has a decreasing trend up to 27Hz before gradually decreasing with a constant slope. We can
clearly have a diﬀerent behavior, but not any behavior. It seems that we can get parts of the
distribution. Similarly, if we look at the experimental drag spectrum (bottom-right), we observe
growth between 1Hz and 5Hz, followed by a decreasing trend up to the cutoﬀ frequency. The
simulated graph shows a slightly increasing trend between 1Hz and 10Hz, with a bump at 2Hz
before gradually decreasing up to the cutoﬀ frequency. We ﬁnd drag spectra is far away from
the experimental one. An intriguing observation is that the simulation with a higher proportion
of group 1bubbles exhibits the most divergent behavior compared to the experimental results.
This suggests that the presence of the second group of bubbles has a signiﬁcant positive impact
on the accuracy of the simulation and that there is room for improvement for the ﬁrst group of
bubbles. Since the inlet conditions were extrapolated from the DIVA conﬁguration, it is likely
that they do not correspond accurately to the reality of the single-cylinder setup. Examining
the injection conditions reveals a very low void fraction for group 2. This case is close to a bub-
bly regime, which could explain the simulated drag spectrum. However, we can note that the
simulations yield promising results and are not entirely diﬀerent from the experimental spectra,
which was not initially expected considering the modeling and the principles of URANS. We also
conﬁrm that this regime yields better results as it is less sensitive to the liquid Reynolds number,
mainly due to the presence of large structures. To attempt to understand the changes in the
topology that lead to better results, we can look at the void fraction distribution within the ﬂow.

for three diﬀerent Reynolds numbers: Rel= 7500(left),Rel= 15000 (middle), and Rel= 30000
(right). In the case of the lowest Reynolds number (left), we observe detachment at the channel
inlet due to the presence of group 2bubbles. Additionally, the simulation exhibits a lack of sym-
metry. This asymmetry is partly due to the averaging process, which is conducted over a short
time interval of a few seconds, with a time step of 0.1seconds. However, this phenomenon is also
indicative of the challenges in the modeling process. Ultimately, the prediction of both groups
of bubbles has limited interaction because it occurs through the liquid phase. Consequently, the
balance between the gas phases can be fragile. This can lead to wall detachments that result in
signiﬁcant ﬂow asymmetry, destabilizing the ﬂow and causing a deviation in the jet, ultimately
leading to a stable state without intermittency around the cylinder. This issue is particularly
pronounced at low superﬁcial velocities. Therefore, there may be a need for improved modeling
of momentum exchange between the bubbles, especially in cases with low Reynolds numbers, to
further stabilize the jets. This deviation of the jet is a key factor contributing to the increase in
the lift standard deviation.
In the case of the intermediate Reynolds number (middle), we also notice a slight devia-
tion in the jet behind the cylinder. In this scenario, this eﬀect is primarily attributed to the
averaging time step (which diﬀers from the measurement time step around the cylinder) being
somewhat large and the total averaging time (which is not the same as the total simulation
time) possibly being a bit short. However, it is worth noting that the simulation is symmetric
and appears well-balanced. We observe a larger wall gradient compared to the bubbly ﬂow due
to the presence of group 2 bubbles.
135Chapter 4 – Simulations of two-phase ﬂows around a cylinder
In the case of the highest Reynolds number (right), we also observe a slight asymmetry at the
rear of the cylinder for the same reasons mentioned earlier. However, this time, we see weaker
near-wall gradients because group 2 is signiﬁcantly less dominant. Consequently, we encounter
a topology closer to that of a purely bubbly ﬂow scenario.
We observe a signiﬁcant characteristic of this regime: the void fraction is distributed more
isotropic on average than in the bubbly regime. To better understand the mean changes, it is es-
sential to investigate the unsteady ﬁelds, which are, however, more challenging to interpret since
one needs to capture the meaning behind this unsteadiness. To help to understand, the void
fraction can be interpreted as the probability of ﬁnding gas at a speciﬁc point at a given moment.

Figure 4.8 illustrates the instantaneous void fraction of group 1(top) and group 2(bottom)
in simulated cap-bubbly/churn single-tube experiment for Rel= 7500(left),Rel= 15000 (mid-
dle) andRel= 30000 (right). In the case of the lowest Reynolds number (left), we can visually
observe the jet deviation to the left. For group 1(top-left), we see many dynamic structures
near the wall, primarily due to the presence of group 2bubbles and the low injection velocity.
This could be attributed to a lack of communication between the two gas ﬁelds and/or an over-
prediction on the lift force in the motion equations. Notably, there is no direct inﬂuence of the
void fraction on the lift force, and no experiments exist to verify its signiﬁcance at very high
void fractions. Additionally, we observe the absence of clusters behind the cylinder, but the
presence of a highly sheared dynamic zone, likely responsible for the peak in the lift spectrum.
As for the gas ﬁeld 2of bigger bubbles (bottom-left), we notice a narrowing of the jet from
the channel inlet. We also partially observe the activation of the LIM during the jet shearing
after the cylinder, followed by partial dispersion. This indicates a transition from dispersed to
LIM and from LIM to dispersed, which appears to be functioning correctly. There is no cluster
zone observed behind the cylinder because the ’larger bubbles’ are too inert and are sheared
further away than the smaller bubbles. This behavior seems qualitatively reasonable. We also
observe near-wall zones where the LIM is activated, but it doesn’t necessarily yield qualitatively
meaningful results. Indeed, the LIM lacks modeling and validation regarding its interaction
with the wall and some problems of back ﬂow from LIM-outlet interaction can arise. One of the
challenges encountered is that if the LIM is not adequately pushed away from the wall, it can
stagnate in very near-wall cells, hindering proper convergence of the calculations. Therefore, a
more detailed examination of the interaction between the large interface and the wall with the
LIM would be necessary.
When considering the intermediate Reynolds number and the void fraction ﬁeld of group 1
(middle-top), we observe a topology that is somewhat similar to what is seen in bubbly ﬂow,
with a slight cluster behind the cylinder and a thin single-phase zone upstream of the cylinder.
However, we do notice dynamic zones along the vertical walls, primarily due to the presence
of the group 2ﬁeld. If we look at the group 2ﬁeld of bigger bubbles (middle-bottom), we see
a region behind the cylinder where there are no bubbles, owing to the high presence of small
bubbles. Nevertheless, there is signiﬁcant shear around the ﬁeld of group 1bubbles. We also
observe that the LIM does not activate around the cylinder, but rather near the vertical walls,
adopting an annular ﬁeld behavior in this region. This behavior is qualitatively consistent, but
underscores the need for further validation of the LIM when it interacts with the wall. This
topology, with fewer bubbles from the ﬁrst group, seems to promote a more balanced behavior,
which could explain the better results in the force spectra. It is possible that the drag force
needs improvement to account for more slip, achieving a less precarious balance between the
phases. To explore this, we can examine the test case with a majority of group 1bubbles and a
higher Reynolds number.
In the case of the higher Reynolds test case, particularly in the group 1ﬁeld (top-right), we
observe dynamic zones near the vertical walls due to the presence of group 2bubbles. Interest-
ingly, there is neither a purely single-phase zone nor a clustering around the cylinder. However,
a single-phase zone is observed at the center of the bubble shear, which appears surprising. This
phenomenon is a result of the narrowing of the sheared zone due to the presence of group 2
bubbles and likely an imbalance between the two phases. Examining the gas ﬁeld of group 2
bubbles, we notice that these bubbles are not entrained in the wake of the cylinder, creating a
wake constraint that inﬂuences the shape of the group 1ﬁeld. Activation of the LIM is almost
non-existent because the presence of group 2is signiﬁcantly less dominant. Near the wall, we
137Chapter 4 – Simulations of two-phase ﬂows around a cylinder
observe strong vortices due to lift forces. This raises questions about whether the lift force is
correctly modeled for group 2bubbles. The distinct topology observed behind the cylinder,
diﬀerent from other cases, is likely the cause of the poor drag force results. As for lift, the nar-
rowing of the zone due to the presence of group 2causes acceleration and thus a slightly diﬀerent
standard deviation compared to the experimental data, which may explain the deviation from
the experimental results.
In summary, the force spectra obtained are consistent with the simulated topology, and we
observe some favorable trends compared to the experimental data. It is worth recalling that
even in bubbly ﬂow, achieving spectra close to experimental results was challenging. However,
it is noteworthy that the presence of group 2bubbles did not signiﬁcantly degrade the predictive
capability of the model. It appears that group 2imposes a favorable topology similar to that
observed in experiments. It seems that it is likely easier to obtain good spectra compared to
experimental data for these regimes. While improvements are required, the results obtained are
not arbitrary; they are rather encouraging. Through this study, we have identiﬁed areas for
improvement:
mThe lift force appears to have too signiﬁcant an inﬂuence compared to the drag force in the
modeling. It is particularly important to thoroughly investigate the eﬀect of void fraction
on lift. Additionally, it seems that improvements are needed for modeling lift forces for
group 2bubbles.
mA force or a new drag coeﬃcient that could promote a better balance between the two
groups of bubbles seems necessary when dealing with dynamic zones, especially when the
injection velocity is low or when the presence of group 2is signiﬁcantly less dominant.
Indeed, these less responsive bubbles tend to disrupt the dynamics when they are in the
minority or when the ﬂow rate is low.
mAn improvement of the lubrication force to better account for near-wall eﬀects, particu-
larly addressing issues related to the stagnation point in dispersed phases.
We have seen that liquid Reynolds number and homogeneous void fraction were the most
inﬂuential parameters, giving rise to diﬀerent ﬂow regimes. It was observed that obtaining force
spectra corresponding to the bubbly regime was the most challenging due to its sensitivity to
liquid ﬂuctuations, the topology around the cylinder, and the acceleration caused by conﬁne-
ment. This was conﬁrmed by comparing experimental and numerical observations. However,
for the DIVA conﬁguration, the cylinders upstream and downstream of the central cylinder are
expected to constrain the ﬂow topology around it, bringing it closer to the experimental setup.
Additionally, velocities at the rear and front of the central cylinder should be more moderate,
reducing the inﬂuence of liquid ﬂuctuations and potentially leading to a better reproduction of
the experimental ﬂow. Hence, we are hopeful of achieving relatively good results. Moreover, we
have demonstrated that cap-bubbly/churn regimes are more resilient to liquid ﬂuctuations and
void fraction variations. We aim to obtain qualitatively good results, showcasing the potential
of our modeling approach.

Simulations of two-phase ﬂows in a square
tube bundle conﬁguration
This chapter presents the two-phase simulations of a square tube bundle (DIVA)
conﬁguration.
The ﬁrst part studies the experimental results and analyze them before conducting
several simulations. The initial section focuses on how to estimate the operational
conditions of the experimental loop to correctly simulate with our model. In
particular, a method is discussed for estimating the injection conditions between
the two groups and justifying the model’s relevance concerning the experiment.
The following part deals with the experimental spectra of drag and lift forces for
some experimental tests, aiming to highlight the key parameters for selecting and
justifying the simulations performed.
The second part addresses the DIVA test cases in this thesis. The ﬁrst section
investigates the eﬀect of the liquid Reynolds number in the bubbly case, while the
second section explores the eﬀect of the Reynolds number in cap-bubbly and churn
cases.Summary
139Chapter 5 – Simulations of two-phase ﬂows in a square tube bundle conﬁguration
5.1 On studying experimental results for simulations
5.1.1 Estimation of the operational conditions for the simulations
As a reminder, the experimental DIVA setup hosted at CEA, as depicted in Figure 1.15, is
dedicated to the study of square-pitch bundle vibrations. The loop is set with a pump able to
deliver water at a ﬂow rate ranging from 5to300L/s and an air compressor able to supply up
to3000m3/h at an absolute pressure of 8bar. This loop can operate with a water ﬂow, an
air ﬂow, or an air-water ﬂow. The experimental conﬁguration is an ascending channel with a
rectangular cross-section measuring 0.18m×0.3m, within which a square tube bundle, made
of rigid tubes with dimensions of 5×3, and a pitch ratio of 1.5, can be placed, as presented in
[95] and in Figure 1.15.
Flow measurements at the inlet and outlet of the channel allow for the precise measurement of
the operational air and water ﬂow rates for each of the tests, and consequently, the superﬁcial
velocities of the liquid jland the gas jg. Measurements of interfacial velocities have also been
conducted to obtain a measurement of the mean Sauter diameter Dsm. Two optical probes
positioned midway between the central tube and the downstream tube, on either side of the
centerline, enable the measurement of the local void fraction αgwithin the setup. Therefore, for
each of the tests, we have the following information: αg,Dsm,jl, andjg. However, to faithfully
reproduce the operating conditions of DIVA with TRITON, it is necessary to prescribe the fol-
lowing information at the inlet: αg1,αg2,Dsm1,Dsm2,jl, andjg. Hence, we need to ﬁnd a way
to estimate these quantities in order to initialize simulations.

Figure 5.1 illustrates the methods used to identify ﬂow regimes and void fraction distribution
between the two groups of bubbles. The left graph, titled "Regime Identiﬁcation," shows how
diﬀerent experimental ﬂow regimes are identiﬁed using the Probability Density Function (PDF)
of the local void fraction. The bubbly regime is characterized by a single peak between 0and
140Chapter 5 – Simulations of two-phase ﬂows in a square tube bundle conﬁguration
0.2, while the annular regime is characterized by a single peak between 0.9and1. The cap-
bubbly regime is characterized by a peak between 0and0.2extending into higher void fractions,
while the churn regime is characterized by a peak between 0.9and1extending into lower void
fractions. Since regime transitions are not entirely abrupt, some judgment must be exercised in
some cases. However, the regime identiﬁcation and the next calculation were performed inde-
pendently.
The central graph illustrates the method for assessing the distribution of void fraction between
the two groups of bubbles. The void fraction PDF graphs from all experimental trials exhibit a
dip around αg≈0.6, which consistently falls within a region of decreasing probability density
function for both bubbly and annular regimes. This phenomenon is similar to the distribution
of mean Sauter diameters between the two groups. This observation led to the diﬀerentia-
tion of events between the two groups around the calculated value of chapter 3 for water-air,
αg1max≈0.623. Consequently, this method enables the discrimination of two event areas cor-
responding to the two groups of bubbles. We thus estimate the mean local void fractions of
the two bubble groups by measuring the respective area under the curve ffrom both sides of
αg1max, so that:

Figure 5.2 displays the distribution of the local void fraction between the two gas groups
using the previous method. It can be observed that the points corresponding to the bubbly
regime are spread in the region primarily occupied by group 1, and this distribution subse-
quently converges towards the distribution of the cap-bubbly regime. This observation aligns
141Chapter 5 – Simulations of two-phase ﬂows in a square tube bundle conﬁguration
with our expectations. The points corresponding to the cap-bubbly regime initially cluster in
an area around αg1= 0.35andαg2= 0.07, then appear to follow a line with a slope of 1.47,
common to the churn regime. The line ends at the annular regime, where only group 2is present.
This local measurement does not allow for the direct estimation of the void fraction distri-
bution to be injected due to the slip between phases. To achieve this, it is necessary to estimate
the void fraction in the section and then obtain the void fraction to be injected. We can rely on
the characteristics of the two groups. The proportion of the void fraction in group 1is mainly
due to phase slip, as it composed of many bubbles. To do this, we can ﬁrst estimate the void
fraction in the section as <αg1>Sby:

For group 2, since the bubbles are very large and rather ’lonely,’ they completely pass in front
of the probe. Therefore, the locally measured path time is indeed representative in the section,
and thus:

Figure 5.3 illustrates the distribution of the void fraction within the section between the two
groups of bubbles. As expected, we observe that the bubbly regime is primarily characterized
142Chapter 5 – Simulations of two-phase ﬂows in a square tube bundle conﬁguration
by a high proportion of group 1bubbles in the section. We can observe a cap-churn point
in the middle of bubbly ﬂow regime points, it means that this one may not be well identiﬁed
and belongs to bubbly regime or that the computation was not accurate. The cap-bubbly and
churn regimes, on the other hand, are characterized by an increase in the proportion of group
2compared to group 1, as anticipated. Ultimately, the increase in group 2tends to reduce
the presence of group 1, leading to an annular regime where only group 2is represented. This
estimation of the gas distribution within the section naturally includes a signiﬁcant uncertainty
due to the assumptions made to obtain these results. However, it is also important to note the
presence of computed limitations related to the void fraction, introduced in chapter 3.
The ﬁrst one is the packing limit for group 1,αg1max= 0.623, used in the estimation. It is
obvious that the bubbles of group 1do not exceed this limit. However, it may be necessary to
conduct more experiments with higher superﬁcial velocities to approach this limit. We also get
that in the cross-section, the void fraction is rarely above 0.51, value already discussed in chapter
3 and often observed experimentally. The second limit, associated with group 1,αg1min= 0.325,
which corresponds to the minimum of liquid ﬂuctuations observed by the bubbles, aligns well
with the experimental limit for the bubbly regime of group 1, as seen in the literature. The third
limit, related to the second group of bubbles, αg2max= 0.806, corresponding to the limit for the
presence of large structures computed in chapter 3 and supported by the literature, is indeed
respected. More surprisingly, the limit αg2min= 0.247, derived from the same calculation as
αg2max, is diﬃcult to interpret since it does not correspond to anything in the literature, but
seems to be a good estimate of the limit for the churn regime. These observations support the
idea that this estimation in our case is fairly accurate.
However, since we do not know the velocity proﬁle, we are required to inject uniformly with
ﬂat velocity and void fraction proﬁles at the inlet of the domain of computations. Therefore, it
is necessary to estimate the homogeneous void fraction to be injected into the section. To do
this, we assume that the distribution in the section is identical to what needs to be injected.
Indeed, the average gas velocities of the two groups are often very close, so we can assume that
distribution of the void fractions of the two groups in the section is the one injected due to the
conservation of the ﬂow rates of the two groups. We then have that the void fractions to be
injected,<αinj

Figure 5.4 illustrates the distribution of the void fraction to be injected into the simulations
for the two groups of bubbles. We can clearly see clusters of simulations with homogeneous void
fractions for the bubbly cases, which is consistent with the experimental tests. The distribution
remains identical to the one described earlier, with values shifted due to the slip of gas relative
to the liquid. These values are then used for simulating the ﬂows in DIVA.
However, there is a missing estimation of the diameters of the two groups to inject properly
into the simulations. Measuring Sauter diameters without a distribution is very challenging. By

However, we do not have the information of Dsm1. Nevertheless, we can attempt a rough
estimation by assuming that the probe primarily measures the interfacial area of group 1since
it is an order of magnitude larger in most cases. Since the calculation is based on interfacial
velocities, a ﬁrst approximation is to assume that the measured diameter is simply the diameter
of the ﬁrst group Dsm1visually enlarged by the presence of bubbles from the second group. The
enlargement is due to the time of presence of group 2tg2compared to the total gas time tg, as

Figure 5.5 illustrates the estimation of the mean Sauter diameter for the two groups of
bubbles. This method appears to provide consistent values for group 1and values for the second
group in a limited number of cases. However, it is important to note that this method relies on
highly simpliﬁed and debatable assumptions. Fortunately, the prediction of spectra should not
be very sensitive to the value of the diameter if it correctly handles the dynamics, as long as
it remains reasonably physical. Additionally, the interfacial area of group 2is often too small
to be measured by a single probe, and measuring and characterizing the large interfaces can be
complex. Therefore, we will use these measurements for the cases to be simulated only when it
gives coherent values.
5.1.2 Identiﬁcation of key parameters for forces spectra
It is essential to identify the key parameters that inﬂuence the changes in experimental force
spectra in order to wisely choose some test cases. Figures 5.6 and 5.7 depict the drag and lift
force spectra acting on the central tube of DIVA as a function of the liquid reduced frequency

injected void fractions.

Figure 5.6 encompasses all four identiﬁed regimes. The drag spectrum (bottom) consistently
exhibits an increasing trend between fr= 0.1andfr= 0.5, followed by a decreasing trend
starting at fr= 2. The behavior between fr= 0.5andfr= 2depends on the injected void
fraction. The lift spectrum (top) displays a similar behavior. A similar but shifted behavior
in terms of fris obvious in Figure 5.7. There is a general uplift in the spectra with respect to
the void fraction, with no signiﬁcant eﬀect from the regimes, except for the annular case in the
lift spectrum. While the drag spectrum appears to be well bounded between purely liquid and
purely gas cases, the lift spectrum seems to be bounded between the purely liquid and churn
regimes. Indeed, the annular regime appears to exhibit a distinct behavior, likely due to the
extremely low presence of liquid. This behavior is also observable in Figure 5.7.

Diﬀerent behaviors are noticeable among the various Reynolds numbers, but an increase in
the void fraction tends to rise the graphs, enhance the slopes of the decay, and broaden the
frequency peaks. Based on these observations, it appears that the force spectra primarily de-
pend on the liquid Reynolds number and the injection void fraction, and thus, on the parameter
pair (jl,jg)at ﬁrst order in our simulations. No eﬀect of injected diameter is visible on those
spectra. Unlike the case with a single cylinder, there is no cluster between the spectra of the
cap-bubbly and churn regimes. The « linearity » in the evolution of spectra with void fraction
indicates that the spectra are not very sensitive to bubble diameters within the ﬂow. Based
on observations made in a single cylinder, it can be inferred that this phenomenon arises from
the speciﬁc bundle conﬁguration that forces the ﬂow to have a certain topology. The distinctive
behavior of lift spectra in the annular regime suggests that the liquid almost no longer inﬂuences
the spectra, but the large structures present in the annular ﬂow are of paramount importance,
especially concerning passages between the cylinders, which impose a certain topology. It ap-
pears, therefore, that it is necessary for the modeling of the continuous gas phase to carefully
consider the interaction with the cylinders to obtain accurate results.

with a slope increase between 0.7and1up to approximately fr≈0.2, followed by a slope de-
crease of 1.95for the churn regime and from fr= 0.6for the cap-bubbly regime. This behavior
can be explained by the diﬀerence in Reynolds number, indeed all cap-bubbly ﬂow regimes are
those with higher Reynolds number. The lift spectra (top) also exhibit a similar pattern with an
increase around fr≈0.5, followed by a slope decrease of 1.2up tofr≈1.7, and then a change
in slope for the churn regime and a jump followed by a slope change for the cap-bubbly regime,
both with a slope of 1.95. The slightly diﬀerent behavior of the cap-bubbly regime may also be
explained by diﬀerence of the Reynolds numbers. Indeed, according to Figures 5.6 and 5.7 this
eﬀect depends on the Reynolds number. Thus, it appears that Relandαgare the parameters
of paramount inﬂuence for the behavior of the spectra at the ﬁrst order in this case.

are noticeable. In the bubbly regime, the lift spectrum exhibits a similar appearance, whereas
the drag spectrum is rather ﬂat or even decreasing. This behavior appears to be characteristic
of high Reynolds number bubbly ﬂows with void fractions below 0.5−0.6.
As a reminder, we ﬁrst concluded on the eﬀect of (jl,jg)at ﬁrst order. However, we did not know
if it was the eﬀect of liquid Reynolds (with jl) and void fraction (withjg
jl+jg) or if it was due
to the liquid mean cross-sectionnal velocity (with jg+jl) at ﬁrst order and regime dependency
at second order. Hence, with the previous observations it becomes obvious that jg+jland the
ﬂow regime have the most signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the force spectra.
The spectra are sensitive to jg+jland the ﬂow regime with little inﬂuence from the diameter
at the ﬁrst order. It can be noted that the bubbly and annular regimes exhibit distinct behaviors
concerning drag and lift spectra, respectively. Obtaining accurate drag spectra for bubbly
regimes and high Reynolds numbers seems somewhat more complicated. This can be explained
by the strong depression at the back of the cylinder and lower velocities in these areas compared
to the spaces between the cylinders. Conversely, lift spectra in the annular regime have a unique
behavior, possibly due to the presence of large gas structures between the tubes, where there is
little liquid, and horizontal movements between the cylinders. To verify these hypotheses based
on experimental data and the methods used to calculate inlet conditions, it is necessary to study
numerical simulations.

5.2 Simulations of the DIVA experiment
5.2.1 Meshing strategy
A particular work had to be carried out on the meshing of the DIVA conﬁguration. Indeed, it is
necessary to mesh the entire conﬁguration with hexahedral elements that are not too deformed.
Furthermore, the boundary layer zone around the cylinders already has particularly compressed
elements, so it is preferable to avoid a non-uniform grid in the tangential direction to the cylin-
der. To achieve this, the strategy is ﬁrst to constrain the grid to cover 10%of the cylinder’s size,
making it as homogeneous as possible. Then, the idea is to avoid stretching the elements too
much in all directions and too abruptly. The meshing challenge then lay in correctly accounting
for the boundary layer on the ﬂat wall and the one around the cylinder. The goal is to have a
mesh that does not cause abrupt changes due to strong variations in mesh volume, especially
near the wall. Finally, after studying several conﬁgurations with bubbly test cases, a meshing
strategy was developed and is presented in Figure 5.10.

simulations.
Figure 5.10 shows an example of a coarse mesh for the DIVA conﬁguration. The strength
of these meshes is that they exhibit few severe distortions near the walls, mesh convergence is
straightforward to interpret because the elements maintain their aspect ratio, and as the mesh
becomes ﬁner, the distortions become less signiﬁcant for the ﬂow. Regarding mesh convergence,
the model is sensitive to the mesh and typically converges less easily than a mesh for a purely
single-phase ﬂow. For the studied velocities, the maximum boundary layer thicknesses δmaxare
compiled in the following table 5.1.

To ease the study of mesh convergence and the design of diﬀerent meshes, we used the mesh
convergence of the highest Reynolds number from the bubbly case as our reference. Therefore,
we have the Coarse, Medium, and Fine meshes, corresponding to general mesh sizes of 1mm,
0.6mm, and 0.1mm. For the ﬁne mesh of the bubbly case, the near-wall mesh had to be divided
by 2. Convergence is veriﬁed for all meshes in comparison to the time-averaged void fraction
proﬁle in the middle between the inlet and the ﬁrst cylinders. All simulations presented here are
done using the Medium meshes. Thus, the mesh for the bubbly case with the lowest Reynolds
number is ﬁner than necessary, but that of the churn cases is guaranteed to converge for the
large interfaces.
We have veriﬁed that the solution was suﬃciently converged to obtain interpretable results.

5.2.2 Bubbly ﬂow simulations
The previous section helped identify the liquid Reynolds number and the void fraction as im-
portant parameters inﬂuencing force spectra. Therefore, in this section, we aim to replicate the
Reynolds number eﬀect in bubbly test cases. Indeed, experimental comparisons can be con-
ducted using the collected data and the estimated inlet conditions presented in the previous
section. We investigate three liquid Reynolds number cases: 5516,8275, and 15171, for approx-
imately homogeneous void fractions of about 0.2. Table 5.2 summarizes the conditions of the
test cases studied.

To understand the challenge of obtaining accurate force spectra and to demonstrate the con-
tribution of our modeling, we ﬁrst analyze the same model as in the last part of the introduction
: the native NEPTUNE_CFD model with Ruyer-Seiler polydispersion. For this purpose, we
focus on the ﬁrst case with Rel= 5516.

and time-averaged liquid velocity (left) for Rel= 5516by computing with the model before
modiﬁcations and Ruyer-Seiler model.
Figure 5.11 illustrates the temporal averages of liquid velocity (left), turbulent intensity
(middle), and void fraction (right). It quickly becomes visible that the colormap representa-
tions are symmetric, indicating a correct resolution. In the velocity graph (left), there is an
acceleration between the cylinders and the forks at the end of the bundle, which results from
turbulence. This appears consistent with a single-phase perspective. The graph of turbulent
intensity (middle) shows that it increases around the cylinders, with a turbulence intensity of
40%, which is a reasonable order of magnitude compared to single-phase ﬂows in the literature,
although there is no direct comparison available for this two-phase case. Regarding the void
fraction graph (right), there is an increase in void fraction upstream of the cylinders, similar to
the case with a single cylinder. It is also visible that the region corresponding to the cluster
observed in the single-cylinder case is constrained by the downstream cylinder. At the outlet
of the bundle, the void fraction spreads out, with a preferred zone toward the center of the
channel. These observations align with the expected ﬂow topology. However, this is not enough;
it is now essential to analyze the force spectra, which serve as our indicators of ﬂuctuating forces.

Figure 5.12 shows the lift and drag force spectra from DIVA experiment and simulations for a
liquid Reynolds number of 5516, using the native NEPTUNE_CFD model with injected diame-
ters of 6mm and 4mm, in comparison with the experimental data. Looking at the experimental
lift spectrum (top), there is a relatively ﬂat distribution between 3Hz and 10Hz with two peaks
at1Hz and 6Hz, followed by a decrease with a constant slope up to the cutoﬀ frequency. The
153Chapter 5 – Simulations of two-phase ﬂows in a square tube bundle conﬁguration
two simulated lift spectra have a similar trend with a sharp increase with a bump between 1Hz
and6Hz, followed by a decrease up to 20Hz and a change in slope, continuing to decrease at a
constant rate. Thus, they deviate signiﬁcantly from the experimental lift behavior. Regarding
the drag spectrum, the experimental data shows a decrease between 1Hz and 6Hz, followed
by an increase up to 16Hz with two peaks at 8Hz and 16Hz, then gradually decreasing to 40
Hz before reaching the cutoﬀ frequency. The two simulated drag spectra also exhibit a similar
trend with an increase between 1Hz and 3Hz, followed by a plateau up to 7Hz forDsm= 6
mm and 9Hz forDsm= 4mm, before rapidly decreasing to the cutoﬀ frequency. Therefore,
these spectra also diﬀer substantially from the experimental ones.
The basic modeling approach does not appear to capture the correct trends of the experimental
force spectra. This is one of the reasons that motivated the use and development of a new model.
Now that we have seen that we can qualitatively obtain good results regarding averaged
quantities, but that the spectra can be quite diﬀerent from the experimental spectra, we can
return to the study presented in the beginning of the section. This will allow us to quantify the
contribution of our modeling compared to what can be obtained by default. To compare with
the native model, we ﬁrst analyze the time-averaged void fraction and liquid velocity ﬁelds and
see the changes.

of liquid velocity ﬁeld (right) for Rel= 5516. Simulation with new TRITON model.
Figure 5.13 shows the colormaps of the time-averaged void fraction (left) and time-averaged
magnitude of liquid velocity ﬁeld (right) for Rel= 5516. It is immediately noticeable that
both ﬁelds are mostly symmetrical. Looking at the time-averaged void fraction ﬁeld (left), we
can observe nearly the same aspect compared to Figure 5.11 and an increase in void fraction
near the walls. However, we can see that the regions behind the cylinders are more spread out
and less conforming to the cylinder’s shape. There are also remnants of ﬂuctuations related
to turbulence. This eﬀect is mainly due to the anisotropy of the turbulent dispersion force,
resulting in more ﬂuctuations and a diﬀerent topology. Now, if we look at the liquid velocity
154Chapter 5 – Simulations of two-phase ﬂows in a square tube bundle conﬁguration
ﬁeld (right), we can qualitatively see few diﬀerences in velocities compared to the basic model,
except for wider velocity dispersion between the tubes in our model. So, we have qualitatively
similar results, but it appears to take into account more ﬂuctuations. To understand the ef-
fect of these ﬂuctuations, we can analyze the force spectra for diﬀerent liquid Reynolds numbers.

As a reminder, we concluded in section 5.1.2 that the forces spectra depend on the average
liquid velocity in the section at ﬁrst order. Therefore, it is maybe possible to connect the two-
155Chapter 5 – Simulations of two-phase ﬂows in a square tube bundle conﬁguration
phase simulations with frequencies already observed in the single-phase DIVA cases. To recall,
single-phase DIVA simulations were presented in [130]. The author demonstrates the presence

Figure 5.14 displays the lift (top) and drag (bottom) spectra of the forces exerted on the
central cylinder by the ﬂuid for Reynolds numbers of 5516(left), 8275(middle), and 15171
(right), compared to experimental spectra.
Focusing on the lift spectrum for the Rel= 5516case (top-left), the experimental data de-
creases between 1Hzand10Hzwith three bumps at 1Hz,3.1Hz, and 8Hz. Since the natural
inter-tube frequency is 23.5Hz, it appears that these two frequencies ( 3.1Hz and 8Hz) could
correspond to Von Karman and conﬁnement phenomena. It then shows a new bump between 10
Hz and 20Hz before gradually decreasing towards the cutoﬀ frequency. The frequency around
10Hz could correspond to ﬂuctuations related to bubbles since it is not visible in the simulated
spectrum. The simulated spectrum exhibits a rather decreasing trend between 1Hz and 20Hz
with three bumps at 1Hz,3.2Hz, and 8Hz. This reinforces the hypothesis of Von Karman and
conﬁnement, as observed in the simulation. It is mainly ﬂat between 10Hz and 20Hz before
decreasing towards the cutoﬀ frequency. Therefore, the simulated spectrum closely matches the
experimental one, unlike the results obtained with the native model. We had anticipated this
behavior by observing the experimental results from DIVA and the simulations with a single
cylinder.
To further conﬁrm the validity of the results, it is also important to look at the drag spectrum
(top-right). The experimental spectrum is mainly ﬂat between 1Hz and 10Hz, with a bumps
at6Hz, followed by a consistent slope before the cutoﬀ frequency. The simulated spectrum also
exhibits a similar ﬂat behavior between 1Hz and 10Hz, with two bumps at 6Hz and 8Hz.
It then decreases with a constant slope before the cutoﬀ frequency. Thus, there is an overall
similarity between the simulated behavior and the experimental observations. It appears that,
in this case, the modeling has signiﬁcantly improved the force spectrum acting on the central
cylinder.
If we look at the lift spectrum for the Rel= 8275case (middle-left), the experimental data
initially decreases between 1Hz and 8Hz. It then increases up to 12Hz before decreasing
towards the cutoﬀ frequency. The simulated spectrum exhibits a decrease between 1Hz and 8
Hz. Then, two additional bumps can be seen at 10Hz and 12Hz before declining towards 20
Hz and decreasing to the cutoﬀ frequency. These frequencies are related to the conﬁnement.
Therefore, the simulated spectrum is similar to the experimental one up to 11Hz. The lack of
power in these frequencies likely stems from the turbulence model, which may not account for
these scales, or from the URANS aspect, which could admits cutoﬀs.
To check whether it is indeed a scale cutoﬀ phenomenon and not a modeling deﬁciency, we can
look at the drag spectrum (middle-right). The experimental spectrum is mainly ﬂat between 1
156Chapter 5 – Simulations of two-phase ﬂows in a square tube bundle conﬁguration
Hz and 10Hz, with a bump between 7Hz and 8Hz. It then decreases with a typically constant
slope before the cutoﬀ frequency. The simulated spectrum also displays a relatively ﬂat behavior
between 1Hz and 10Hz. It then has a peak at 11Hz (conﬁnement) before rapidly declining
to17Hz and then decreasing to the cutoﬀ frequency. Again, we observe a behavior similar to
the experimental. It seems that, in this case, the modeling is not suﬃcient to account for ﬂuc-
tuations above 11Hz to accurately reproduce the lift spectrum or that certain frequencies are
favored over others. To conclude on some issues, we can study the higher Reynolds number case.
If we look at the lift spectrum for the Rel= 15171 case (bottom-left), the experimental data
mainly decreases towards the cutoﬀ frequency. The simulated spectrum shows an overall ﬂat
behavior between 1Hz and 20Hz, with two bumps at 4.9Hz and 14Hz. It then rapidly declines
to40Hzbeforedecreasingtothecutoﬀfrequency. Thus, thesimulatedspectrumcloselymatches
the experimental one up to 20Hz. While the simulated spectrum is qualitatively comparable to
the experimental one, there is a decrease in amplitude towards higher frequencies. This result
suggests that lower frequencies are favored by the modeling. Moreover, in this simulation, the
eﬀects of conﬁnement, horizontal movements, and Von Karman are ampliﬁed, tending to reduce
the contribution of smaller scales.
To gain a better understanding of this phenomenon, we can look at the drag spectra (bottom-
right). The experimental spectrum is almost ﬂat between 1Hz and 10Hz, with a bump at 4
Hz, then decreases with a typically constant slope up to 40Hz, followed by a peak at 50Hz
before the cutoﬀ frequency. The simulated spectrum increases between 1Hz and 11Hz and
then decreases up to the cutoﬀ frequency. Except for the peak at 50Hz, it appears that the
simulated spectrum is fairly accurate. It seems reasonable if it is indeed a mixing phenomenon
related to bubbles. Therefore, we are missing high-frequency phenomena that likely arise from
the modeling, particularly turbulence for the drag.
We observed that in the bubbly regime, similar frequencies to the single-phase case were
found, including conﬁnement and Von Karman eﬀects, but we missed phenomena related to
ﬂuctuations generated by the bubbles. It would be interesting to model them correctly to verify
this. However, we can obtain spectra closer to the experimental one than those in a single
cylinder, as anticipated in Chapter 4. To understand where the attenuation of high frequencies
in lift and drag comes from, we can study the instantaneous void fraction proﬁles to understand
the diﬀerences between Reynolds numbers and the variations in ﬂuctuations.

Rel= 5516(left),Rel= 8275(middle) and Rel= 15171 (right). Simulations with new TRITON
model.
Figure 5.15 shows color maps of the instantaneous void fraction for DIVA bubbly simulations
at Reynolds numbers of 5516(left), 8275(middle), and 15171(right). Looking at the overall ap-
pearance of the simulations, we can observe regions with high void fraction, single-phase regions
where gas has diﬃculty penetrating, and ﬂuctuations. Focusing on the lowest Reynolds number
(left), we notice areas of high void fraction at the rear of the cylinders, which can be interpreted
as regions where bubbles reside for a longer duration. In this case, the local void fraction is
relatively low, around 11%, which tends to emphasize the void fraction ﬂuctuations, potentially
resulting in less smoothed ﬂuctuations. There are also phenomena of bubbles passing between
rows of tubes and from the rear of one cylinder to another. The ﬂuctuations at the exit of the
bundle are relatively dispersed compared to the regions around the cylinders.
If we look at the intermediate Reynolds number (middle), we notice a less pronounced slip
between phases because the local void fraction is higher due to the higher velocity. This results
in ﬂuctuations that have less impact, especially during the transitions between the cylinders.
We also observe less void fraction at the rear of the cylinders compared to the other Reynolds
number, which can explain the lower high-frequency components in the drag, as they are weaker,
and the lift is smoothed by the smaller void fraction variation. At the exit of the bundle, we
can see more concentrated regions at the rear, indicating turbulent shear and less slip.
If we look at the case of the highest Reynolds number (right), we observe even less slip
between the phases, resulting in a local void fraction close to 20%. This leads to even more
concentrated areas. There is a protective zone around the cylinder due to wall lubrication force
but not causing damage to forces spectra. Additionally, there is a highly spread high void frac-
158Chapter 5 – Simulations of two-phase ﬂows in a square tube bundle conﬁguration
tion zone at the rear of the cylinders, which induces strong lift ﬂuctuations during horizontal
void fraction variations, leading to more intense lift peaks. Furthermore, the high void fraction
zones, which do not have ﬂuctuations associated with the gas phase, may explain the lack of
high frequencies, as the ﬂuctuations are smoothed out by the strong presence of gas. At the exit
of the bundle, there is a very strong presence of gas, including a deviation of the jet due to the
horizontal movement of bubbles, causing instability in random directions.
We can conclude that the modeling is relatively accurate in partially reproducing the force
spectra acting on the central tube. Especially compared to the model before modiﬁcations, and
with Ruyer-Seiler model, we have signiﬁcantly improved the simulated spectra. However, there
is room for improvement to better account for certain eﬀects that are either too smoothed out or
overly emphasized in our case. One area for improvement could involve better management of
slip eﬀects, especially when slip is relatively low at high velocities. With more slip, there would
be a greater inﬂuence of void fraction ﬂuctuations relative to the local mean ﬁeld. Furthermore,
a more accurate modeling of bubble-induced turbulence, especially around the cylinders, could
help capture ﬂuctuations related to the gas phase more eﬀectively, like mixing phenomena. As
shown in the previous chapter, the current modeling of bubble-induced turbulence is too in-
tense, creating areas of high ﬂuctuations around the stagnation point and excessive smoothing
in regions where turbulence should be present due to its overly high level.
Since regions with high void fractions tend to smooth out ﬂuctuations, we are interested in
test cases where large bubbles and gas pockets are present. Additionally, due to our limited
estimates of bubble diameters, we can only focus on a limited number of test cases. Therefore,
in the following section, we aim to study the topology created by our second gas ﬁeld and the
spectra it induces in cap-bubbly and churn ﬂow cases.
5.2.3 Cap-bubbly and churn ﬂow simulations
The previous section helped identify the liquid Reynolds number and the void fraction as im-
portant parameters inﬂuencing force spectra. Therefore, in this section, we aim to replicate the
Reynolds number eﬀect in bubbly cases. Indeed, experimental comparisons can be conducted
using the collected data and the estimated inlet conditions presented in the previous section. We
investigate three Reynolds number cases: 2758,5516, and 8275, for approximately homogeneous
voidfractionsofaround 0.65−0.68. Table5.3summarizestheconditionsofthetestcasesstudied.

Figure 5.16 shows the spectra of drag forces (bottom) and lift forces (top) for simulations
with Reynolds numbers of 2758(left), 5516(middle), and 8275(right), compared to experimen-
tal data.
Looking at the lift graph for the Reynolds number of 2758(top-left), the experimental spec-
trum exhibits an almost constant trend between 1Hz and 8Hz, followed by a decrease up to
the cutoﬀ frequency. The simulation exhibits a slight increase between 1Hz and 6Hz, followed
by a decrease until the cutoﬀ frequency. This demonstrates a qualitatively similar behavior to
the experimental data. Even the standard deviation of the lift (area under the curve) seems well
reproduced.
Regarding the experimental drag spectrum (top-right), we observe an increase between 1Hz
161Chapter 5 – Simulations of two-phase ﬂows in a square tube bundle conﬁguration
and7Hz and then a decrease towards the cutoﬀ frequency. The simulated spectrum exhibits
an increase between 1Hz and 6Hz, followed by a decrease until the cutoﬀ frequency. Similar to
the lift, we obtain a good simulated graph compared to experimental data. This behavior could
be attributed to a better reproduction of the topology around the cylinder and the presence of
the second group of bubbles.
Looking at the lift graph for the Reynolds number of 5516(middle-left), the experimental
spectrum shows an increase between 1Hz and 4Hz followed by a decreasing trend with a con-
stant slope up to the cutoﬀ frequency. In contrast, the simulated spectrum increases between
1Hz and 4Hz, then has a ﬂat trend up to 11Hz before decreasing. It seems that we can get
parts of the distribution. This is due to too short simulation due to numerical problems.
Similarly, if we look at the experimental drag spectrum (bottom-right), we observe an increase
between 1Hz and 10Hz, followed by a decreasing trend up to the cutoﬀ frequency. The sim-
ulated graph shows a slightly increasing trend between 1Hz and 6Hz, then decreases up to
the cutoﬀ frequency. This shows that even though we do not have enough simulated time, we
still ﬁnd a good agreement between the simulation and the experimental behavior, and that our
model works quite well.
If we look at the experimental lift spectrum for the Reynolds number of 8275(bottom-left),
we observe an increase between 1Hz and 4Hz, followed by a decrease towards the cutoﬀ fre-
quency. The simulation shows a slight increase between 1Hz and 6Hz, followed by a decrease
up to the cutoﬀ frequency, with a small bump at 20Hz.
Examining the corresponding drag spectrum (bottom-right), the experimental data reveal an
increase between 1Hz and 10Hz, followed by a decrease up to the cutoﬀ frequency. In contrast,
the simulated graph increases between 1Hz and 8Hz, then decreases up to the cutoﬀ frequency.
Consequently, this simulation has better reproduced the random force spectra than in the cor-
responding Relin bubbly ﬂow.
An intriguing observation is that the simulations gave good results with a very rough ap-
proximation of the group 2diameter and a lot of approximations for the distribution of void
fraction. This suggests that the presence of the second group of bubbles has a signiﬁcant positive
impact on the accuracy of the simulation. It seems that the simulation is not that sensitive to
the value of Dsm2, a phenomenon suggested on the experimental graphs. It surprisingly appears
that spectra from bundle geometries are easier to get that the one from single tube. Indeed, the
bundle mix well the simulations, the velocities before and behind the tubes are smaller, without
stagnation point, and it seems that it also depends less on the prediction of the turbulent quan-
tities. However, there is room for improvement. To identify the changes that may be necessary
we can look at void fraction predictions.

Figure 5.17 depicts the averaged void fraction in a simulated cap/churn single-tube exper-
iment for three diﬀerent Reynolds numbers: Rel= 2758 (left),Rel= 5516 (middle), and
Rel= 8275(right). In the case of the lowest Reynolds number (left), we observe detachment
at the channel inlet due to the presence of group 2bubbles. We observe a good symmetry of
the computation. The asymmetries are primarily attributed to the averaging time step and the
overall averaging time used to generate this ﬁgure. Qualitatively, we observe experimental char-
acteristics of intermittent regimes: the void fraction is distributed very uniformly throughout
the bundle. A detailed analysis of the distribution between the two gas ﬁelds will shed light on
this phenomenon. We encounter nearly monophasic regions, largely due to lubrication forces.
However, in this case, it does not seem to degrade the results for the force spectra. Additionally,
unlike in bubbly ﬂow, at the exit of the bundle, there is no longer evidence of intermittent alleys
in the prediction of the averaged void fraction. Turning our attention to the other two cases with
higher liquid Reynolds numbers, but equivalent void fractions, we observe the same phenomena:
a homogeneous distribution of void fraction, detachment at the inlet, and the disappearance of
balanced jet eﬀects at the bundle exit. It seems that the distribution is then not sensitive to the
injected diameter of group 2and the distribution between the two groups.

Figure 5.18 illustrates the instantaneous void fraction of group 1(top) and group 2(bot-
tom) in simulated cap/churn tube bundle experiment DIVA for Rel= 2758(left),Rel= 5516
(middle) and Rel= 8275(right). In the case of the lowest liquid Reynolds number (left), when
we look at the group 1ﬁeld (top-left), we observe a much larger number of dynamic zones
compared to bubbly ﬂow, primarily due to the presence of group 2 bubbles. We also notice the
absence of alleys at the bundle exit, similar to the average void fraction distribution. In the
group 2 ﬁeld, we observe that the LIM is rarely activated in the calculation, except at the bundle
exit. We observe a narrowing of the jet at the entrance, similar to bubbly ﬂow, followed by a
concentration of the ﬁeld towards the center between the cylinders, with a deviation to a hor-
164Chapter 5 – Simulations of two-phase ﬂows in a square tube bundle conﬁguration
izontal ﬂow. However, it is challenging to provide qualitative validation for this ﬁeld in this case.
In the case of intermediate Reynolds numbers (middle) and the group 1ﬁeld (top-middle),
we can qualitatively observe behavior similar to that of bubbly regimes. We see zones of strong
presence behind the cylinders, but the exit jets appear to be less prominent. This is likely why
the average void fraction does not capture this eﬀect. Turning to the group 2bubble ﬁeld,
we observe a more moderate narrowing of the jet at the entrance and fewer horizontal devia-
tions between the cylinders, likely due to the strong presence of group 1 bubbles in these areas.
Here, we notice the LIM activating between the cylinders, creating jets that are subsequently
dispersed at the bundle exit. It appears that improvements are needed to better account for
interactions between the LIM and the walls in order to accurately represent the jet width. How-
ever, despite vastly diﬀerent topologies compared to the lowest Reynolds case, we obtain, on
average, the same result for the void fraction, but achieve better results for the force spectra. To
conﬁrm the model’s behavior when there are many group 2 bubbles, we can look at the last case.
Now, turning our attention to the case with the highest Reynolds number (right), especially
in the context of the group 1ﬁeld (top-right), we still observe behavior similar to that of bubbly
ﬂow, but with conﬁned jets at the bundle exit. In contrast, when we look at the group 2bubble
ﬁeld (bottom-right), we see that the ﬁeld is well-balanced, primarily because it is the dominant
group. It is worth noting that the LIM predominantly activates between the cylinders and is
subsequently dispersed at the bundle exit. This behavior is qualitatively interesting because it
suggests that outside the bundle, we switch to a less dynamic regime with an average void frac-
tion that does not lead to an annular ﬂow pattern. Thus, it appears that the model is behaving
correctly.
In summary, the force spectra in the lift and drag directions are reasonably well reproduced
compared to experiments, for bubbly and cap/churn ﬂows. Indeed, despite the complexity of
the modeling, the URANS aspect, and the poor results obtained with a single cylinder we
have a model able to reproduce the global trends of forces spectra. Additionally, the averaged
distribution of void fraction aligns with experimental observations. It is obvious that for this
regime, we can achieve very similar averages, but encounter rather diﬀerent dynamic behaviors
depending on the liquid Reynolds number. Interestingly, the diameter of the group 2bubbles
appears to have little inﬂuence on the response of random forces. It is worth noting that the
presence of the second group of bubbles has improved the force spectra, likely due to a more
even distribution of void fraction in group 1, which is inﬂuenced by the presence of group 2.
This underscores the value of our modeling approach in replicating force spectra in two-phase
water-air ﬂows. Nevertheless, there are still areas where improvements are possible:
mImproving validation of the interaction between the LIM and the walls appears necessary
to better account for annular regions between the cylinders.
mFurther work is required to identify the appropriate injection parameters for achieving an
annular ﬂow regime, as the experimental data do not provide a clear deﬁnition for the
required input conditions.

166Conclusion and perspectives
In this thesis, our focus has been on developing a modeling approach that aligns with exper-
imental data to replicate drag and lift force spectra on the central cylinder of a tube bundle.
Our research encompassed the consistency of turbulence modeling and involved comparisons of
diﬀerent models in vertical channel conﬁgurations. Notably, we highlighted the successful repro-
duction of void fraction and liquid velocity trends, especially near the walls, using the EBRSM
[77] and turbulence induced by bubbles. After observing modeling challenges, particularly for
high void fractions, we tried to modify and adapt source terms in the IATE 2groups [121] to
enhance simulation stability and coherence while preserving physical consistency. This allowed
for a better consideration of both bubble groups and regions with high void fractions. We also
investigated the coupling forces between gas and liquid ﬁelds to address modeling issues associ-
ated with high void fractions. Changes in the drag coeﬃcient and the transition from the Zuber
[90] added mass model to the Cai and Wallis model [6] proved necessary. We proposed a new
coeﬃcient for turbulent dispersion force [64], along with its anisotropy adjustment, to accurately
account for regions with high void fractions. Due to numerical challenges in simulating scenar-
ios with high void fractions and a signiﬁcant proportion of group 2bubbles, we introduced an
original modeling approach for group 2bubbles to address these issues. Speciﬁcally, increasing
the added-mass coeﬃcient better accounted for the inertia of deformed bubbles, leading to re-
duced activation of the LIM [16] and enhanced diﬀusion in the second-group bubble diameter
equation. We also attempted to justify the use of some experimental limits for ﬂow regimes
and bubble group distributions through simple calculations and the consideration of turbulent
dispersion, aiming to support our modeling approach. Theoretical justiﬁcations were provided
for limiting void fractions of 0.62,0.33, and 0.8, commonly found in models based on corre-
lations. Additionally, we initiated changes in the modeling approach to replicate experiments
involving water-steam mixtures, aiming for a better understanding of the diﬀerences compared
to the water-air cases.
We subsequently studied a single-tube conﬁguration to assess the relevance of experimen-
tal results and identify key parameters. This investigation revealed that the liquid Reynolds
number and void fraction were the most inﬂuential parameters. We then simulated experi-
mental cases using the new model, encompassing bubbly and churn/cap-bubbly regimes, with
liquid Reynolds numbers ranging from 7500to30,000and void fractions around 0.2and0.65.
We encountered challenges with this conﬁguration due to containment eﬀects and the model’s
sensitivity to equilibrium conditions around the cylinder. Nonetheless, our simulations demon-
strated that the model could replicate experimental topologies, though it appeared to lack in
modeling for induced turbulence by group 1bubbles and exhibited near-wall problems, partic-
ularly around the stagnation point. However, we achieved a more robust modeling approach
for obtaining force spectra, and it was possible to qualitatively obtain good power distributions.
167Chapter 5 – Simulations of two-phase ﬂows in a square tube bundle conﬁguration
Nevertheless, obtaining the standard deviation of these forces proved to be more challenging.
Furthermore, our investigations highlighted that churn/cap-bubbly ﬂow cases could yield quan-
titatively better results because group 1was constrained by group 2. This phenomenon was
particularly pronounced with the signiﬁcant presence of group 2and liquid injection velocities
high enough to balance the dynamics between the two groups. In conclusion, we identiﬁed po-
tential improvements related to a better consideration of void fraction eﬀects on drag and lift
coupling forces, as well as the embodiment of a new force or coeﬃcient modiﬁcation to enhance
the dynamic balance between the two gas ﬁelds in the model.
Finally, we turned our attention to the simulation of DIVA. We proposed a simplistic method
for identifying ﬂow regimes and void fraction distributions between the two bubble groups to
obtain the distribution of void fractions between the two groups to be injected and, in some
cases, bubble diameters for both groups. Using this method, we successfully replicated the char-
acteristic void fractions associated with diﬀerent ﬂow regimes. These results were compared to
those calculated in Chapter 3to validate our approach. Furthermore, our investigation high-
lighted key parameters, particularly the liquid Reynolds number and void fraction, as signiﬁcant
factors, as discerned from the study of force spectra. It is noteworthy that, in the case of DIVA,
void fraction behavior appears more ’linear’ in spectra compared to the single-cylinder conﬁgu-
ration. Additionally, a distinct behavior in the lift spectrum was identiﬁed for the annular and
bubbly ﬂow regimes. Subsequently, we conducted simulations in bubbly and churn/cap-bubbly
regimes for injection liquid Reynolds numbers ranging from 2700to8200, with void fractions
around 0.2and0.66. These simulations demonstrated that achieving quantitatively accurate
spectra is easier with a bundle of tubes than with a single cylinder. This can be attributed to
the containment eﬀects imposed by the cylinders, which result in a more complex topology. The
lower impact of turbulence eﬀects in regions with relatively low velocities, such as the front and
rear of the cylinders, contributes to this improvement. Thus, our modeling approach proved to
be interesting, yielding promising qualitative and quantitative results for force spectra and void
fraction distributions. However, areas for improvement were also identiﬁed, particularly con-
cerning the LIM. It is imperative to conduct a more detailed investigation into the interaction
between LIM and the walls to validate its relevance. The model appears to encounter diﬃculties
in accurately representing the size of the annular regions between the cylinders. This is one of
the reasons why we did not present calculations for purely annular ﬂow. The other reason lies
in the uncertainty surrounding how to inject the bubble ﬁeld to faithfully reproduce this regime
and the large interfaces it entails. Ultimately, despite the extensive modeling, the URANS as-
pect of the model, we have achieved encouraging and promising results. Nevertheless, there is
a continued need for improvement, particularly in accounting for the interactions between the
liquid and gas phases, with the aim of developing a model able to simulate two-phase ﬂows
involving water and steam.
This thesis has also brought to light suspended issues related to two-phase modeling, as well
as potential challenges in forthcoming comparisons.
First, one could consider the broader development of a lubrication force applicable across all void
fractions and ﬂow topologies. In a general sense, it would be insightful to compare and validate
force modeling for extremely high void fractions, particularly drag and lift forces. Connected
to this issue, a more precise study and comparison involving model bubbles, such as the Taylor
bubble, for interfacial force modeling, would hold signiﬁcant interest for the overall modeling,
especially the LIM interacting with walls.
In terms of additional modeling, it is of paramount importance to conduct a comprehensive
investigation into the averaged two-phase turbulence, in order to accurately capture the under-
168Chapter 5 – Simulations of two-phase ﬂows in a square tube bundle conﬁguration
lying mechanisms. Furthermore, a more in-depth study than the one proposed in this thesis
would be valuable in enhancing our understanding and inclusion of the complete theoretical
mechanisms leading to the transition into a continuous modeling framework.
From the perspective of experimental validation, it remains imperative to both verify and better
modeling at extremely high void fractions, applicable to both channels and bundles. Indeed, the
scarcity of literature on these void fraction levels can be attributed to challenges in instrumen-
tation and the determination of parameters required for accurate simulation of such regimes.
Following an investigation into the square pitch bundle conﬁguration, like DIVA experiment,
there arises an opportunity to study a triangular pitch conﬁguration, which could lead to simi-
lar issues as in the single-cylinder case (especially with the stagnation points). This exploration
holds promise for a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying phenomena. Moreover,
triangular pitch conﬁgurations should replace square pitch bundles in future steam generators
(EPR).
Ultimately, it becomes imperative to couple the two-phase model with a method that takes into
account the solid movement, in order to validate the physics in the context of a vibrating tube.
We attempted to numerically compute the mechanical loading exerted by a two-phase ﬂow on a
rigid tube in a square pitch bundle. To compute DIVA, simulations will need to consider tube
vibrations, thus implementing a coupling model between the structure and the ﬂuid, as a com-
plete ﬂuid-structure problem. This expanded approach holds the potential better understand
and model the vibrations of U tubes in steam generators.

Modélisation moyennée diphasique
La modélisation employée dans cette thèse repose sur un modèle à deux-ﬂuides – trois-champs
(section 2.1), comprenant un champ liquide continu, un champ de gaz dispersé, composé de
bulles peu déformées (plus petites que 10.8mm), et un champ hybride dispersé-continu pour
tenir compte des bulles très déformées (entre 10.8mm et 108mm) et des poches de gaz (section
2.2), comme illustré sur la Figure B.5.

La simulation repose également sur la modélisation de la turbulence liquide pour correcte-
mentreproduireleseﬀortsauniveaudestubes(section2.3). Cependant, lesmodèlesdiphasiques
de la littérature sont validés sur des conﬁgurations sans obstacle. La présence des tubes engendre
une topologie particulière de l’écoulement qui empêche l’utilisation directe du modèle de base
(section 2.4).
Validation et changements dans la modélisation
Une étape d’adaptation et de validation du modèle a donc été nécessaire avant de réaliser les
simulations. En premier lieu, un changement de paradigme a été necessaire. Un critère basé sur
la taille du maillage pour passer du modèle dispersé au modèle continu est couramment utilisé
dansla littérature, bien quesasophistication puissevarier. Contrairementauxmodèlesexistants
qui introduisent la confusion entre la modélisation dispersée et la vision dispersée à travers un
maillage de capteurs, notre méthode repose sur des considérations physiques, illustrées sur la
Figure B.8. Nous supposons d’abord que la coalescence des petites bulles du Groupe 1 engendre
les bulles du Groupe 2. Ensuite, les bulles déformées du Groupe 2 peuvent se transformer en
grandes poches de gaz et en interfaces étendues. Cette perspective découle de la croissance
naturelle des interfaces, passant d’une catégorie à une autre et ﬁnalement à un champ continu.
Cette transition se produit lorsque le diamètre équivalent devient trop grand, créant une grande
interface, ou lorsque la fraction de vide devient trop élevée, limitant l’arrangement des grosses
bulles et conduisant ainsi à la présence d’un régime annulaire.

la littérature et notre modélisation
Ensuite, une étape de validation et d’étude du couplage diphasique-turbulence liquide sur des
expériences en canaux (étroit et large) a été conduite (section 3.1). Préalablement, nous avons
sélectionné quatre modèles de turbulence fréquemment cités dans la littérature liée à notre sujet
: le modèle k−ε[47], le modèle SSG [9], l’EBRSM [77] et l’EBRSM avec turbulence diphasique
[81]. Cette comparaison avec des données expérimentales nous a permis d’acquérir une meilleure
compréhension de l’interaction entre les modèles de turbulence et le modèle diphasique. L’étude
a révélé le potentiel du modèle EBRSM, que ce soit avec ou sans turbulence diphasique, dans la
reproduction des tendances des proﬁls de taux de vide et de vitesse. Ces résultats ont conduit
à la décision de poursuivre notre travail en se concentrant sur le modèle EBRSM.
Par la suite, un travail de recherche et d’ajustement a été entrepris pour adapter la modélisa-
tion diphasique en tenant compte des taux de vide élevés (section 3.2. Nous avons initialement
étudié les forces d’interaction liquide-gaz, qui présentent des dépendances non linéaires par rap-
port au taux de vide. Le coeﬃcient adimensionnel de traînée diverge avec le taux de vide,
nécessitant ainsi une correction. La force classique de masse ajoutée de [90] montre également
une divergence avec le taux de vide. Nous avons donc opté pour une formulation plus générale,
celle de [6], qui ne diverge pas et dépend du rapport de masse volumique. De plus, nous avons
proposé une nouvelle expression corrigée du coeﬃcient de dispersion turbulente de [64] pour
éviter ces divergences, comme illustré dans la Figure B.9.
Dans le même souci d’amélioration, des corrections ont été apportées aux termes sources de
coalescence et de fragmentation des bulles pour résoudre les problèmes près de la paroi et dans
les zones à fort taux de vide. Parallèlement, des déﬁs ont émergé concernant la dynamique du
Groupe 2. Les simulations ont révélé des problèmes liés à des accélérations élevées, des sauts
dans la prédiction du diamètre et une reproduction inhabituelle des interfaces dans le champ

De plus, l’augmentation du coeﬃcient de masse ajoutée a permis d’augmenter la diﬀusion
dans l’équation du diamètre pour atténuer les problèmes de sauts. Enﬁn, nous avons établi
un critère de taux de vide pour activer le champ continu en nous appuyant sur des calculs
analytiques simples basés sur les équations moyennées, assurant ainsi une transition ﬂuide de la
vision dispersée à la vision continue.
Simulations moyennées diphasiques avec un cylindre unique
L’étape suivante a eu pour but de simuler des écoulements diphasiques eau-air autour tube
unique aﬁn de comprendre la réponse du modèle proposé dans cette thèse. En premier lieu, une
étude de sensibilité du modèle diphasique en régime bubbly est proposée aﬁn de comprendre
la physique reproduite dans les simulations à travers les spectres de forces exercées sur le tube
(section 4.1). Cette étape permet notamment d’axer la réﬂexion sur les aspects numériques de
la modélisation physique. La partie suivante s’intéresse à la comparaison et à la compréhension
des résultats numériques et expérimentaux (section 4.2).
Nous avons constaté que le nombre de Reynolds liquide et le taux de vide homogène étaient
les paramètres les plus inﬂuents pour la reproduction des spectres de force numériques. Il a
été observé que l’obtention de spectres de force correspondant au régime à bulles était la plus
diﬃcile en raison de sa sensibilité aux ﬂuctuations du liquide, de la topologie autour du cylindre
et de l’accélération causée par le conﬁnement. Cependant, pour la conﬁguration en faisceau de
183Chapter B – Appendice: Résumé substantiel en français

l’avant du cylindre central devraient être plus modérées, réduisant l’inﬂuence des ﬂuctuations du
liquideetpotentiellementconduisantàunemeilleurereproductiondel’écoulementexpérimental.
Par conséquent, nous avons été optimiste quant à l’obtention de résultats relativement bons
en faisceau de tubes. De plus, nous avons pu montrer que les régimes cap-bulles/churn sont
plus résilients aux ﬂuctuations du liquide et aux variations du taux de vide. Finalement, les
spectres de force obtenus sont cohérents avec la topologie simulée, et nous observons certaines
tendances favorables par rapport aux données expérimentales. Bien que des améliorations soient
nécessaires, les résultats obtenus sont plutôt encourageants.
Au cours de cette étude, nous avons identiﬁé des pistes d’améliorations :
mLa force de portance semble avoir une inﬂuence trop importante par rapport à la force de
traînée dans la modélisation. Il est particulièrement important d’étudier de manière ap-
profondie l’eﬀet du taux de vide sur la portance. De plus, il semble que des améliorations
soient nécessaires pour modéliser les forces de portance pour les bulles du groupe 2.

lorsque la vitesse d’injection est faible ou lorsque la présence du groupe 2est nettement

globale lorsqu’elles sont en minorité ou lorsque le débit est faible.
mUne amélioration de la force de lubriﬁcation pour mieux prendre en compte les eﬀets
proche parois, notamment les problèmes de point d’arrêt en dispersé, est nécessaire.
Simulations moyennées diphasiques en faisceau de tubes à pas
carré
Enﬁn, la dernière partie s’intéresse à la comparaison des résultats expérimentaux et numériques
dans le cas d’un écoulement diphasique eau-air dans un faisceau de tubes à pas carré (DIVA). En
premier lieu, une analyse des résultats expérimentaux a pour but de renseigner nos simulations
sur les conditions opératoires et sur les paramètres clés pour la simulation des spectres de force
et justiﬁer les cas tests dans la suite (section 5.1). Cela a permis de comprendre que les spectres
de forces numériques devraient être sensibles à la vitesse moyenne liquide au premier ordre et
au régime d’écoulement au second ordre, avec peu d’inﬂuence des diamètres. Il est à noter que
les régimes bubbly et annulaire présentent des comportements distincts par rapport aux autres
régimes concernant les spectres de traînée et de portance, respectivement, les rendant sûrement
plus diﬃcile à obtenir numériquement.
La dernière partie permet de comparer les résultats expérimentaux aux simulations pour 3 in-
jections liquides diﬀérentes, pour les régimes bubbly et cap/churn (section 5.2). Les spectres
de force dans les directions de portance et de traînée sont raisonnablement bien reproduits par
rapport aux expériences, pour les écoulements à bulles, illustrés dans la Figure B.11 et les écoule-
ments cap/churn, illustrés dans la Figure B.12.
En eﬀet, malgré la complexité de la modélisation, l’aspect URANS et les résultats mitigés
obtenus avec un seul cylindre, nous disposons d’un modèle capable de reproduire les tendances

2semble avoir peu d’inﬂuence sur la réponse des forces aléatoires. Il est à noter que la présence
du second groupe de bulles a amélioré les spectres de force, probablement en raison d’une distri-
bution plus uniforme du taux de vide global, qui est inﬂuencé par la présence du groupe 2. Cela
souligne la valeur de notre approche de modélisation dans la reproduction des spectres de force
dans les écoulements diphasiques eau-air. Néanmoins, il existe encore des pistes d’améliorations
possibles :

199Titre : Etudes numériques et expérimentales des écoulements diphasiques en intéraction avec un faisceau
de tubes
Mots clés : écoulement diphasique, approche multi-champ, faisceau de tubes, simulation numérique, cou-
plage de modèles, interaction ﬂuide-structure.
Résumé : Les générateurs de vapeur (GV) des cen-
trales nucléaires sont composés de faisceaux de
tubes soumis à des écoulements diphasiques eau-
vapeur. Les vibrations liées à cette interaction peuvent
induire des dommages (fatigue et usure par frotte-
ment et chocs) pouvant entraîner de graves consé-
quences pour la sûreté nucléaire. Dans le cadre de
la prévention des risques vibratoires des tubes de
GV des études expérimentales sont réalisées à l’aide
de faisceaux analytiques de tubes droits soumis à
un écoulement transverse diphasique. En parallèle,
il est également important de développer un outil
de simulation numérique permettant d’accéder à des
données et des informations difﬁcilement mesurables.
L ’objectif de cette thèse est donc de simuler l’inter-
action entre un ﬂuide diphasique et une structure
rigide (tube unique ou faisceau de tubes), à l’aide
du code NEPTUNE_CFD. Ces simulations doivent
permettre de reproduire le chargement mécanique
exercé par le ﬂuide sur les tubes. La modélisation em-
ployée dans cette thèse repose sur un modèle à deux-
ﬂuides - trois-champs, comprenant un champ liquide
continu, un champ de gaz dispersé, composé debulles peu déformées, et un champ hybride dispersé-
continu pour tenir compte des bulles très déformées
et des poches de gaz. La première partie de ce tra-
vail s’est concentrée sur la validation du couplage
diphasique-turbulence liquide ainsi que sur la modi-
ﬁcation et l’adaptation de la modélisation pour mieux
prendre en compte la présence d’une structure im-
mergée. De nouvelles modélisations pour la force de
dispersion turbulente, les termes sources de coales-
cence et fragmentation, la masse ajoutée et le cri-
tère d’activation du champ continu ont été proposées.
Dans la deuxième partie de ce travail, nous avons si-
mulé l’écoulement diphasique autour d’un tube unique
ﬁxe, aﬁn d’en extraire une physique sous-jacente et
d’identiﬁer ses limites et lacunes. Enﬁn, dans la der-
nière partie de ce travail, nous avons simulé l’interac-
tion d’un écoulement diphasique avec un faisceau de
tubes rigides. Les résultats numériques ont été com-
parés aux mesures expérimentales. Cette approche
nous a permis de justiﬁer l’intérêt de notre modéli-
sation, de trouver des similitudes entre les résultats
numériques et expérimentaux, tout en proposant des
pistes d’amélioration.
Title : Numerical and experimental studies of two-phase ﬂows interacting with a bundle of tubes
Keywords : Two-phase ﬂow, multi-ﬁeld approach, bundle of tubes, numerical simulation, model coupling,
ﬂuid-structure interaction.
Abstract : The steam generators (SG) in nuclear po-
wer plants are made up of bundles of tubes subjec-
ted to two-phase water-steam ﬂows. Vibrations re-
lated to this interaction can cause damage (fatigue,
wear due to friction and shocks) that can lead to se-
rious consequences for nuclear safety. In the context
of preventing vibrational risks in SG tubes, experimen-
tal studies are conducted using analytical bundles of
straight tubes subjected to transverse two-phase ﬂow.
In parallel, it is also important to develop a nume-
rical simulation tool to access data and information
that are difﬁcult to measure. The goal of this work
is to simulate the interaction between a two-phase
ﬂuid and a rigid structure (single tube or bundle of
tubes) using the NEPTUNE_CFD code. These simu-
lations aim to reproduce the mechanical loading exer-
ted by the ﬂuid on the tubes. The modeling used in
this work is based on a two-ﬂuid - three-ﬁeld mo-
del, including a continuous liquid ﬁeld, a dispersed
gas ﬁeld made up of slightly deformed bubbles, and adispersed-continuous hybrid ﬁeld to account for highly
deformed bubbles and gas pockets. The ﬁrst part of
this work focused on the validation of the two-phase
liquid-turbulence coupling as well as the modiﬁcation
and adaptation of the modeling to better account for
the presence of an immersed structure. New models
for turbulent dispersion force, source terms of coales-
cence and break-up, added mass, and the activation
criterion of the continuous ﬁeld were proposed. In the
second part of this work, we simulated the two-phase
ﬂow around a ﬁxed single tube to extract underlying
physics, and identify its limitations and shortcomings.
Finally, in the last part of this work, we simulated the
interaction of a two-phase ﬂow with a bundle of ri-
gid tubes. The numerical results were compared to
experimental measurements. This approach allowed
us to justify the relevance of our modeling, ﬁnd simi-
larities between numerical and experimental results,
while also suggesting areas for improvement.
