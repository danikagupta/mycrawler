Pollutants Nowadays the treatment of environmental pollutants such as synthetic dyes 
(used in multiple industries such as paper, textile, food, plastic and 
pharmaceutical) has received much attention, especially for biotechnological 
treatments using both native and artificial enzymes. In this context, many 
enzymes have been reported to efficiently perform dye degradation. 
Peroxidase is one such enzyme, which causes dye degradation either by 
precipitation of chemical structure of aromatic dyes or by opening up their 
aromatic ring structure. In the present study an extra-cellular peroxidase 
extracted from a bacterial strain Bacillus sp. F31 JX984444.1  was tested for its 
capability to decolorize 16 different dyes used in various industries. Out of 16 
different textile dyes the Bacillus sp. peroxidase efficiently decolorized 5 dyes 
out of which 4 triphenyl methane dyes (Basic Fuchsin (BF), Rhodamine B 
(RB), Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBBG) and Malachite Green (MG) showed 
decolorization up to 95.5%, 70.8%, 70% and 40%, respectively, while a 
polymeric heterocyclic dye Methylene Blue (MB) showed 66.2% 
decolorization. These 5 dyes were studied to further enhance their 
decolorization by peroxidase after purification by optimizing different 
reaction conditions (temperature, time, enzyme concentration, buffer pH, dye 
concentration and effect of various salt ions, H 2O2 concentration). This study 
indicates that the extracellular peroxidase  (purified) from  Bacillus sp. can be 
used as a useful tool for the treatment (degradation/decolorization) of 
industrial effluents contaminated with harmful industrial dyes.  
 
Introduction  
Industrial pollution refers especially to any 
contamination caused by industrial activities or 
industrial waste. Different industrial activities, 
whether it is the extraction of raw material, 
processing, manufacturing, or waste disposal, leads 
to environmental degradation. Industrial pollution 
is a big issue because, most harmful types of 
pollutants are produced by industries, making it a 
significant form of pollution on the planet. The 
effects of industrial pollution are vast, causing 
contamination, by release of toxic wastes into 
water, soil, air, and it is the cause of some of the 
most significant environmental disasters of all time. 
Water constitutes more than half of our planet, and 
it is getting polluted day by day due to different causes including human activities, one of the most 
limelight is industrial chemicals and wastes. The 
colored wastewater from various industries is the 
main cause of water pollution. Effects of industrial 
water pollution are very harmful to animals, plants, 
human beings as well as entire environment (Ong et 
al., 2011; Hynes  et al., 2020; Arif, et. al., 2020). 
The ecological balance is continuously disturbing 
in whole world every year because, the production 
of industrial effluents is more than the production 
of industrial products. The food web/ food chain of 
organism also severely affected with the toxic 
pollutants released from industrial effluents in the 
environment (Sugano et al., 2009; Pal and Vimala, 
2012; Ramachandran et al., 2013; Telke et al., Journal homepage : https://www.environcj.in/

 2182015; Pandey et al., 2016; Lellis et al., 2019; 
Verma et al., 2021). Therefore, their proper 
discharge and economical treatment of industrial 
waste is a matter of great concern. 
The various dyes used by several industries are the 
main cause of colored wastewater and the most 
problematic groups of pollutants. Harmful synthetic 
dyes are mostly used in textile, refining, oil, plastic, 
tannery, paper/pulp, electroplating and cosmetics 
production units, in the food and pharmaceutical 
industries (Huber, P., & Carré, 2012; Chanwun et 
al., 2013; Guerra et al., 2018; Dhankhar et al., 
2020). Synthetic dyes used in the textile industry 
represent a class of highly durable environmental 
pollutants and non-biodegradable, that are released 
in large amounts in the rivers and other nearby 
water reservoirs. These dyes are highly resistant to 
chemical and physical decomposition methods 
because colour durability is the most important goal 
of dying process (Zucca et al., 2012; Celebi et al., 
2013; Blánquez et al., 2019).  Industrial dyes or 
their degraded products drown in various sources of 
water cause many human health disorders such as 
skin diseases, ulcer, kidney damage, reproductive 
system diseases, disorders of liver, brain and 
nervous system (Husain, 2010). Dyes are 
characterized in specific groups on the basis of 
chemical structure of the chromophoric groups 
(Mathur and Kumar et al., 2013; Tian et al., 2016). 
Wastewater from various industries is estimated to 
contain approximately 15-25% of dyestuff that is 
used in the dyeing process, many of these dyes are 
recalcitrant compounds that is highly stable to heat 
cold, light and microbial attack, making them 
serious pollutants to damage environment (Singh et 
al., 2010). Most experiments on degradation of 
dyestuffs by microbial peroxidase have been 
carried out using either whole culture, crude or 
purified preparations of the peroxidase. Many kids 
of peroxidases decolorize or degrade the dyes by 
asymmetric cleavage of bonds present in 
chromatophoric groups in the dyes (Dawkar et al., 
2009; Fujihara et al., 2010; Du et al., 2011; 
Renugadevi et al., 2011; Saladino et al., 2013; 
Chen & Li, 2016; Ledakowicz & Paździor, 2021).  
All the currently available techniques for dye 
removal, such as chemical oxidation, incineration, 
photo-catalysis or ozonation, reverse osmosis,  
 adsorption are highly efficient but with some 
disadvantages or limitations (Telke et al. 2010).  
All these treatments may result in the production of 
toxic by-products, these are highly costly, limited 
applicability, high energy input etc. Due to the 
inherent drawbacks of physical, chemical and 
photo-chemical approaches (Singh et al., 2010) the 
use of biocatalytic or biological methods for the 
degradation/ decolorization and detoxification of 
wastewaters dyes has proved as a low cast 
alternative, nature friendly as well as the property 
of producing a less quantity of by-products 
(Franciscon et al., 2012; Qin et al., 2018). 
A number of extracellular oxidative enzymes 
extracted from different sources such as bacteria, 
fungi, yeast as well as plants like laccase, lignin 
peroxidase (LiP), manganese peroxidase (MnP), 
versatile peroxidase, cellobiose dehydrogenase and 
other oxidoreductases enzymes have been reported 
on the degradation of industrial dyes (Alam et al, 
2010; Joshi et al., 2010; Kurade et al., 2011; 
Marco-Urrea and Reddy, 2012; Qin et al., 2018; 
Chang et al., 2021). The oxidoreductase enzymes 
like peroxidase and laccase have an advantage over 
other enzymes or chemical processes because of 
their ability to completely mineralize various dyes 
to carbon-dioxide and water during 
degradation/decolorization process (Faraco et al., 
2007; Krishnaveni et al., 2011, Ilić Đurđić  et al., 
2021).  
Peroxidase is an oxidoreductase enzyme, the bound 
cofactor essential for its activity is haem. 
Peroxidase catalyzes the transfer of oxygen from 
the H2O2 to an appropriate substrate (like dyes) and 
consequently brings about oxidation of the 
substrate. Peroxidases can degrade/decolorize a 
wide range of industrial dyes because of their less-
specific nature, as well as are able to transform or 
mineralize many other organo-pollutants (Lauber et 
al., 2017; Morsy et al., 2020). Hence, the aim of the 
present research work was to study the 
biodegradation/bio-decolorization of various 
industrial dyes using an extra-cellular peroxidase 
purified from a bacterial isolate  Bacillus sp. F31 
JX984444.1  which was isolated from onion waste 
and crude oil-polluted soil samples. Further, the 
purified bacterial peroxidase showed different 
specificities and efficiencies toward different 
industrial dyes.

 Material and Methods 
Organism 
The bacterial isolate Bacillus sp. F31 JX984444.1  
was originally isolated by serial dilution plate 
technique (Dhingra and Sinclair, 1993) using agar 
medium, from onion waste soil samples from 
District Mandi (Himachal Pradesh, India). 
Preparation of crude enzyme 
The seed culture of Bacillus sp. F31 JX984444.1 
was raised at 37°C (120 rpm) for 24 h. The 50 ml 
of production broth [containing beef extract (0.1%), 
glucose (1.4 %), yeast extract (0.2%), peptone 
(0.5%), NaCl (0.5), H 2O2 (0.06%; v/v) with final 
pH of 7.5] was used to culture seed (10%, v/v). 
Then the culture seed was incubated for 2 days (48 
h) under shaking conditions at 120 rpm at 37°C. 
Then the cell-free broth termed as crude peroxidase 
was extracted from harvesting incubated broth by 
centrifugation (10,000 X g for 20 min at 4°C; 
SIGMA 3K30, Germany).  
Protein and peroxidase assay 
Protein concentration was measured by a standard 
protein estimation method (Bradford, 1976) using 
Bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. The 
assay of peroxidase in the broth or purified enzyme 
fraction was done by a colorimetric method using 
o-phenylenediamine (OPD) as a chromogen and 
H2O2 as a substrate (Bao et. al., 2020). The A 492 
values were recorded and activity of the peroxidase 
was determined.  
Enzyme unit of peroxidase  
The amount of enzyme needed to convert 1.0 µM 
of chromogenic substrate (OPD) to its product (2, 3 
diamino-phenazine) per min at pH 5.2 and 
temperature 37ºC is known as one unit (U) of 
peroxidase enzyme. 
Purification  
The crude bacterial peroxidase (extracellular) 
produced from bacterial strain Bacillus sp. F31 
JX984444.1  was purified by ammonium sulphate 
precipitation, dialysis and DEAE-cellulose column 
chromatography (anion-exchange chromatography). 
SDS-PAGE was used to determine molecular mass 
of purified peroxidase.

decolorization assay mixture containing 50 µl of 
different dyes (20 µM), 700 µl (0.1 M) phosphate 
citrate buffer (pH 5.2), 15 µl H 2O2 and 0.75 U 
purified peroxidase to make the final volume 1 ml 
in different cuvettes. Decolorization of the test dye 
was assayed after incubation at 37ºC for 30 min, by 
observing the absorbance (A) at the respective 
wavelength (λmax) of the dye and decolorization 
(%) was determined as follows:

degradation by purified peroxidase  from 
Bacillus sp. F31 JX984444.1  
Out of 16 dyes tested for decolorization, only 5 
dyes (BF, RB, MB, CBBG and MG) that were 
efficiently decolorized by bacterial peroxidase were 
selected for further studies. The purified peroxidase 
was used to evaluate the effect of various reaction 
conditions (or reaction parameters) such as 
temperature, reaction time, enzyme quantity, buffer 
system pH, effect of concertation of dye, effect of 
salt-ions on degradation of selected dyes and 
optimized conditions for dye degradation were 
ascertained. 
Optimization of temperature (°C) for 
degradation of dye with purified peroxidase 
To determine optimum temperature for degradation 
or decolorization of selected dyes (BF, RB, MB, 
CBBG and MG), the degradation reaction [1 ml 
reaction mixture containing 15 µl H 2O2, 0.75 U 
purified peroxidase, 50 µl (20 µM) of different dyes 
and 700 µl (0.1 M) phosphate citrate buffer (pH 
5.2)] was carried out at selected temperatures (25, 
30, 35, 37, 40 and 45°C) in Eppendorf tubes in a Chaudhary  et al.

 Application of an extracellular peroxidase 
(purified) from Bacillus sp. F31 JX984444.1  in 
degradation of industrial dyes 
Screening of industrial dyes for decolorization 
by purified peroxidase  
To test the ability of bacterial peroxidase to 
decolorize a few selected industrial dyes namely 
BPB, RY, CR, XY, MO, RB, EB, BBR, BF, BBY, 
DV, DB, MB, BRL, CBBG and MG, each of these 
dyes was subjected to treatment with purified 
peroxidase (0.75 U) at 37ºC for 30 min in 
phosphate citrate buffer (pH 5.2). Out of these 16 
textile dyes, the purified peroxidase efficiently 
decolorized 5 dyes, out of which 4 belonging to 
triphenyl methane group (BF, RB, CBBG and MG) 
showed decolorization up to (95.5, 70.8, 70.0 and 
40.0%, respectively) while a polymeric heterocyclic 
dye (MB) showed 66.2% decolorization (Table 1 
and Table 2). These 5 dyes were selected to further 
enhance their decolorization by purified peroxidase 
by optimizing reaction conditions (temperature, 
time, enzyme concentration, buffer pH, dye 
concentration and effect of various salt ions). 
Therefore, it could be stated that the peroxidase of 
Bacillus sp. F31 JX984444.1 has higher affinity for 
triphenyl methane dyes as substrates. It has been 
reported by the present studies that different types 
of peroxidase(s) decolorize specific type of dyes 
more efficiently as compared to others. The 
Triphenyl methane dyes were efficiently 
decolorized as compared to other groups of 
synthetic dyes by peroxidase from Hevea 
brasiliensis  in a previous study (Chanwun et al., 
2013; Blánquez et al., 2019). Many factors 
influence the decolourization of dyes by an enzyme 
such as their chemical structure, molecular weight 
(Mr), redox potential, molecular weight, complexity 
of side chains and most importantly the binding site 
of enzyme (Pereira et al., 2018; Ardila-leal et al., 
2021). The dye BF having a simple structure with 
small functional groups (NH 2; side chains) and a 
relatively lower Mr (337.8 g/mol) was efficiently 
decolourized as compare to other dyes bearing 
more complex side chains. The side chains often 
account for stearic hindrance in binding to the 
enzyme. This can be possibly the reason for greater 
decolourization of the BF dye by purified 
peroxidase of Bacillus sp. F31.Many types of 
peroxidases purified from various microbial sources such as bacterial, fungi, yeast and plants etc. were 
found efficient to decolorize different industrial 
dyes (Fetyan et al., 2013; Telke et al., 2015, 
Pandey et al., 2016; Ilić Đurđić et al., 2021; Guo et 
al., 2021). The MnP (manganese-independent 
peroxidase) purified from Dichomitus squalens was 
also able to degrade selected azo dyes and 
anthraquinone dyes (Šušla  et al., 2008). The MnP 
sourced from Auricularia uricular-judae was found 
to be highly stable and effective in degradation of 
very complex dyes (Liers et al., 2010). Peroxidase 
isolated from Ganoderma cupreum AG-1 (grown 
on decaying wood) was evaluated for its strong 
ability to degrade many azo dyes (Gahlout et al., 
2013). A newly isolated and purified peroxidase 
from Sterigmatomyces halophilus  (yeast strain), 
under the optimized conditions, showed a complete 
degradation efficiency on many azo dyes within 2 
days (Al-Tohamy et al., 2021). 
Reaction conditions optimization for dye 
degradation by purified peroxidase  from 
Bacillus sp. F31 JX984444.1  
Optimization of temperature (°C) for 
degradation of dye with purified peroxidase 
 Temperature of decolorization reaction system was 
varied from 30 to 45°C for decolorization of BF, 
RB, MB, CBBG and MG separately in the reaction 
mixture (1 ml) containing 0.75 U of purified 
peroxidase. The optimum temperature for each of 
these dye with purified peroxidase was 30°C for 
RB (72.1%), 35°C for MB (82.0%), 40°C for BF 
(92.1%), CBBG (90.2%) and MG (65.2%), 
respectively (Fig. 1).  The recorded data showed that 
purified peroxidase performed efficient 
decolourization of chosen common textile dyes at 
30-40°C. The previous studies for dye degradation 
have proved that peroxidase works efficiently at a 
range of 25-45ºC for different dyes, though in some 
cases free peroxidase retained its activity at a 
temperature as low as 5°C (Carmen et al., 2012). 
The decolourization of MG, a constant temperature 
of 25± 0.5°C (Satapathy et al., 2011) and 30°C for 
the peroxidase of a fungal strain Cunninghamella 
elegans was reported (Roushdy et al., 2011). The 
decolorization of different dyes by peroxidase from 
Trametes versicolor was found to be effective at 
30°C (Celebi et al., 2013). The peroxidase from 
Pleurotus ostreatus  (Shin et al., 1998) efficiently 
decolorized triphenyl methane dyes as BB and MB  Chaudhary  et al.

Indanthrene Blue-RS and other industrial dyes, then 
the optimized temperature for decolorization 
reaction was found 37°C (Mohanty and Kumar, 
2021). In general, peroxidase enzyme tends to lose 
its dye degradation capability beyond 45ºC and 
retained only about half of its activity at 65ºC (Yao 
et. al., 2013). This is possibly due to the reason that 
the higher temperature results in thermal 
inactivation of proteins (enzymes), which also 
affects cell structures and activity of enzymes (Shah 
et al., 2013). 
Optimization of decolorization reaction time for 
degradation of dye with purified peroxidase  
Reaction time of decolorization for each of the 
selected dyes (BF, RB, MB, CBBG and MG) was 
varied from 0 to 45 min. The maximum 
decolorization by purified peroxidase was observed between 30-45 min for MB (82.1%, 30 min) at 
35°C, BF (96.1%, 35 min) at 40°C, RB (76.2%, 40 
min) at 30°C, CBBG (90.0%, 40 min) and MG 
(78.3%, 40 min) at 40°C (Fig. 2). The purified 
biocatalyst efficiently performed decolourization of 
selected dyes between 35-45 min at the chosen 
optimized temperature. The decolourization of the 
dye enhanced with the increase of reaction time but 
little increase in decolourization was noticed after 
40 min for each dye. In another study, the optimum 
time for MB decolourization was also found 40 min 
(Satapathy et al., 2011). The effective and eco-
friendly biodegradation of Reactive Black dye by 
peroxidase from Sterigmatomyces halophilus  
within effective rection time of 1-2 hours has been 
reported recently. It was also proved effective for 
textile azo dye wastewater processing and 
detoxifcation (Al-Tohamy et al., 2020). The 
chemical structure of dye was reported to have a 
relation with degradation time. Generally, dyes 
with low molecular weights and simple structures 
exhibited higher rates of dye removal than high 
molecular weight dyes (Chen et al., 2003). 
Optimization of enzyme (biocatalyst) 
concentration for degradation of dye with 
purified peroxidase 
The concentration of enzyme (purified peroxidase) 
used in dye decolorization assay of 5 selected dyes 
(BF, RB, MB, CBBG and MG) was varied from 0.77 
to 1.05 U for purified peroxidase in the 1 ml final 
volume of reaction mixture. The maximum 
decolorization was observed with 0.94 U of purified 
peroxidase for BF (95.1%) at 40°C in 35 min; 1.05 U 
for RB (82.2%) at 35°C in 40 min, MB (85.1%) at 
35°C in 30 min and MG (78.2%) at 35°C in 40 min, 
and 1.01 U for CBBG (92.1%) at 40°C in 40 min (Fig. 
3).  The removal of an organic pollutant (that act as a 
substrate for enzyme catalysis) is dependent on the 
amount of biocatalyst added and the contact time 
between enzyme and substrate. Increasing enzyme 
concentration will speed up the enzymatic reaction, as 
long as there is substrate available to bind. When all 
the substrate is bound, there will be no increase in the 
speed of reaction, since there will be nothing for 
additional  enzymes to bind to. In a previous study, an 
increase in concentration of the Soyabean peroxidase 
in reaction mixture from 15 U/ml to 85 U/ml resulted 
in slow increase in the dye degradation (16-64%) that 
appeared to be constant at optimized dye 
concentration 80 U/ml (Kalsoom et al., 2013). 
Published studies showed that degradation of an   
                                                                                                                             Evaluating anti-microbial and anti-oxidative potential

azo dye required a much higher amount (15-times 
higher concentration) of enzyme than in the case of 
the anthraquinonic dyes (Mohan et al., 2005). 
Researchers found out that 3.3 μg/ml of peroxidase 
enzyme helped in the efficient removal of an 
anthraquinonic dye, the Reactive Blue 19 (Celebi et 
al., 2013). 
Optimization of reaction buffer (phosphate 
citrate buffer)  pH for degradation of dye with 
purified peroxiadse 
The optimum pH of the assay buffer system for 
efficient decolorization of each selected dye (BF, 
RB, MB, CBBG and MG) with purified peroxidase 
was determined by varying buffer pH (phosphate 
citrate buffer) from 3-7. The optimum pH of 
reaction buffer for each of the selected dyes was 5.0 
for RB (81.2% at 35°C for 40 min with 1.05 U of 
purified peroxidase); pH 5.5 for BF (96.1% at 40°C 
for 35 min with 0.94 U peroxidase) and also for 
MB (83.5% at 35°C for 30 min with 1.05 U of 
peroxidase) and MG (78.3% at 40°C for 40 min 
with 1.05 U of peroxidase); pH 6.0 for CBBG 
(92.2% at 40°C for 40 min with 1.01 U of 
peroxidase) (Fig. 4). All the selected dyes were 
effectively decolorized in pH range 5.0-6.0 and at 
the higher values, the dyes showed less 
degradation. These results seem similar to what 
other researchers have reported (Marchis et al., 
2011; Zhang et al., 2012; Tian et al., 2016) and 
suggested the usefulness of this enzyme to degrade 
industrial effluents or decolorize various industrial   
dyes which might be very acidic in nature. In 
another study, it was observed that strong to 
moderate acidic pH (pH 2-6) of buffer system is 
suitable for decolorization of most of the dyes 
including MG (Zucca et al., 2012). In the catalytic 
cycle of peroxidase all the reactions steps are pH 
dependent so enzyme was appeared to do 
decolorization best under acidic pH range 
(Kalsoom et al., 2013; Blánquez et al., 2019). In 
addition, HRP was reported to catalyze degradation 
of Remazol Blue at a pH of 2.5 (Šekuljica  et al., 
2020). The reaction steps of the catalytic cycle of 
peroxidase were pH-dependent and appeared to 
work best at an acidic pH. On checking pH, 
optimum researchers have obtained a bell-i shaped 
curve with an optimum at pH 5-5.5 (Kinnunen et 
al., 2017). Another study showed the lignin- 
peroxidase to work at an optimum pH of 3, where it 
was used to degrade azure B dye (Silva et al., 
2013). 
Each enzyme has an optimum pH range. Changing 
the pH beyond of this range will slow enzyme 
activity. Extreme pH values can cause denaturation 
of enzymes. At native state an enzyme is a 
combination of both cationic and anionic groups at 
any given pH. These groups are part of the active 
site of an enzyme (Gomare et al. 2008). The rate of 
enzymatic reaction varies with the changes in the 
pH of the reaction medium because the ionic state 
of active site in enzyme changes hence, activity of 
enzyme is also changed (Hossain and  
                                                                                                                             Evaluating anti-microbial and anti-oxidative potential

 Anantharaman. 2006). Moreover, these organic 
dyes have different redox potentials, which may 
also affect the decolorization activity of the 
designed heme enzyme (Jenkins et al., 2021).  
Optimization of selected dye concentration 
(mg/ml) for degradation of dye with purified 
peroxidase 
In the present work, the maximum decolorization 
was found in case of BF (97.1%) at concentration 
800 mg/l at 40°C in 35 min at pH 5.5, for RB 
(86.2%) at 600 mg/l at 30°C in 40 min at pH 5.0, 
MB (84.2%) at 35°C in 30 min at pH 5.5 and MG 
(78.1%) at 400 mg/l at 40°C in 40 min at pH 5.5 
and CBBG (92.1%) at 40°C in 40 min with 200 
mg/l at pH 6.0 (Fig. 5). In the present work, the 
maximum decolorization was found in case of dye 
BF (97.1%) The results were in accordance with a 
previous study, which showed that dye-degradation 
efficiency of enzyme peroxidase decreased with 
increasing concentration of dye, then eventually 
resulted in an inhibition effect, thus presenting less 
degradation (Boucherit et al., 2013). Other 
microbial peroxidase showed similar results where 
the degradation rate decreased with an increase in 
dye concentration (Silva et al., 2012). Enzyme-
catalysed reactions were affected by the 
concentration of the substrate present in the 
aqueous phase (Robinson et al., 2015). It is 
appeared quite possible due to the reason that if the 
substrate concentration is slowly increased and the 
concentration of enzyme is kept constant the 
reaction rate would continue to increase until it 
reaches equilibrium state. At equilibrium, there will 
be maximum rate of reaction after that any further 
addition of the substrate would not increase the rate 
of reaction. The effect of dye concentration in 
reaction mixture is an important consideration for 
its application in industrial dye removal or 
decolorization. In effluent from textile printing 
house, the dye concentration is approximately 100-
800 mg/l (Zhao and Hardin, 2007). According to a 
study, with increase in dye concentration, the 
decolourization efficiency of dye decreased and a 
marked inhibition was exhibited when the dye 
(Remazol Brilliant Blue R) concentrations were 
above 100 mg/l (Silva et al., 2013). The FTIR 
spectroscopy, NMR and GC-MS of several dye 
degradation products using purified peroxidase by 
Bacillus cereus , the results confirmed that decolorization of various industrial dyes was due to 
breakdown of dyes into unknown colourless 
products (Fetyan et al., 2013). 
Optimization of hydrogen peroxide 
concentration (mM) for degradation of dye with 
purified peroxidase 
H2O2 reacts with the native enzyme (purified 
peroxidase from Bacillus sp. F31 JX984444.1)  to 
form an enzyme intermediate, which easily 
combine with an aromatic compound such as dyes 
to carry out its oxidation and produce a free radical 
form. To figure out an appropriate concentration of 
H2O2 is definitely a key factor in obtaining a higher 
rate of dye degradation (Yao et al., 2013). In this 
regard, in present study experiments were done to 
decolouration/ degradation of the selected textile 
dyes (BF, RB, MB, CBBG and MG) the H 2O2 
concentration varied while keeping the other 
reaction conditions of degradation reaction 
constant. The concentration of H 2O2 was varied 
from 0.25 mM to 3.5 mM in dye decolorization 
assay, the optimized concentration of H 2O2 for 
decolorization of all selected dyes (BF, RB, MB, 
CBBG and MG) using purified peroxidase was 
found between 1 to 1.5 mM with a decolorization 
of 97.1% for BF at 40°C in 35 min, 86.2% for RB 
at 30°C in 40 min, 84.1% for MB at 35°C in 30 
min, 92.3% for CBBG at 40°C in 40 min and 
78.1% for MG at 40°C in 40 min (Fig. 6). Activity 
of Peroxidase is known to change considerably with 
change in the concentration of the presence of H 2O2 
(Gholami-Borujeni et al., 2011). Many harmful 
organic compounds including industrial dyes can be 
oxidised and degrade / decolourize by using H 2O2 
alone or in conjunction with other materials. The 
addition of a small amount H 2O2 in the reaction 
mixture may lead to the generation of free radicals 
like •OH that facilitates faster degradation of many 
organic compounds. On the other hand, higher 
concentration of H 2O2 was detrimental to the 
reaction process, most likely due to the damage to 
the enzyme being a protein itself. So, it becomes 
necessary to optimize the H 2O2 concentrations in 
the enzyme-based dye degradation approaches 
(Zhang et al., 2012). For the decolourization of MB 
by HRP, 0.15 mM H 2O2 concentration in the 
reaction mixture was found to be the optimum 
(Satapathy et al., 2012). In case of Soya bean 
peroxidase, increase in H 2O2 concentration in Chaudhary  et al.

reaction mixture led to an increased dye 
decolourization. At 64μM concentration of H 2O2 
maximum dye decolourization was observed, any 
further increase in H 2O2 concentration did not cause 
any additional effect (increase /decrease) on dye 
decolorization (Kalsoom et al., 2012). 
Effect of salt-ions and inhibitors on dye 
decolorization by purified peroxidase  
The decolorization (%) of BF, RB, MB, CBBG and 
MG with purified peroxidase was also determined 
in the presence of selected salt ions and inhibitors 
under optimized conditions. The decolorization of 
all the five dyes with purified peroxidase was 
inhibited by the presence of Hg+2, EDTA, sodiun 
azide, DTT and SDS. However, the decolorization 
was found to be slightly stimulated by purified 
peroxidase in the presence of Zn+2 (BF 100.5%, RB 
101.2%, MB 101.1%, CBBG 101.1% and MG 
101.2%), Mg+2 (BF 101.6%, RB 101.2%, MB 
100.5%, CBBG 101.6% and MG 102.5%) and 
Mn+2 (RB 100.6% and MG 100.2%), (Table 3). As 
in previous study, the decolourization was slightly 
stimulated for extracellular purified peroxidase in

 Mg+2, Zn+2 and Co+2, so the use of such ions could 
be considered in dye decolourization experiments 
as additives for efficient dye decolourization 
(Dawkar et al., 2009; Irshad and Asgher, 2011; Si 
and Cui, 2013). In another study, decolorization of 
MG by peroxidase from Pseudomonas  sp. was 
observed to significantly enhanced in the presence 
of Mg+2 and Mn+2 (1-2 mM) ions (Du et al., 2011). 
Different industries like textile, food, 
pharmaceuticals, cosmetics etc., release a huge 
amount of the effluents daily in the form of 
wastewater into rivers and other water reservoirs 
causing serious health issues. That leads to 
enhanced biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and 
chemical oxygen demand (COD) of water and 
affect the ecosystem drastically. Therefore, it is 
very difficult to treat textile industry effluents 
because of their high BOD, COD, heat, color, pH 
and the presence of metal ions (Anjali et al., 2007). 
Treatment of various industrial effluents discharged 
with harmful compounds like synthetic dyes 
becomes necessary before their final discharge into 
the environment and different water sources. There 
are many conventional methods for the effective 
removal of dyes such as degradation of dye by 
anaerobic reaction, adsorption of dye by activated 
carbon, silica, functional polymer granules, 
biomaterials, nanofiltration, oxidation and 
precipitation by Fenton’s reagent, bleaching with 
chloride, ozone photo degradation and membrane 
filtration (Robinson et al., 2001). These methods 
have been outdated because of many drawbacks 
such as low efficiency, high cost and in-
applicability to a wide variety of complex 
hazardous dyes. In recent years a number of studies 
have focused on some microorganisms capable of 
degrading and absorbing dyes from wastewater. A 
wide variety of microorganisms are reported to be 
capable of decolonization of dyes (Shah et al., 
2013; Šekuljica et al., 2020: Chauhan & Kanwar 
2020; Barathi et al., 2020). Many types of 
peroxidases purified from various sources were 
reported to decolorize different industrial dyes 
(Shin et al., 1998; Hong et al., 2012; Celebi et al., 
2013, Salvachúa et al., 2013; Chen & Li, 2016). 
The MnP purified from Dichomitus squalens was 
also able to degrade selected azo and anthraquinone 
dyes (Šušla  et al., 2008). A thermostable 
peroxidase from Bacillus stearothermophilus and peroxidase sourced from Auricularia auricula-
judae has been found to be stable in decolourization 
of the many complex structured industrial dyes 
such as Reactive Black-5 and Reactive Blue-5 
(Loprasert et al., 1988; Liers et al., 2010). 
Peroxidase isolated from Ganoderma cupreum AG-
1 was evaluated for its ability to decolorize many 
industrial azo dyes Gahlout et al., (2013). In some 
another previous studies, bacterial and fungal 
peroxidase(s) have been found to be very efficient 
biological decolourization tools (Zucca et al., 2012; 
Saladino et al., 2013, Lauber et al., 2017, Morsy et 
al., 2020). The decolorization or degradation of 
industrial dyes by using biocatalysts or enzymes 
from various sources like bacteria, fungi, yeast and 
even plants is an eco-friendly and low-cost process. 
Biocatalytic methods of decolorization also produce 
a low quantity of by-products as compare to 
physical, chemical and photochemical approaches. 
Present results suggested that the extracellular 
peroxidase (purified) from Bacillus sp. F31 
JX984444.1  was effective in discolouration of 
many common textile dyes. The purified bacterial 
peroxidase assisted dye-degradation parameter(s) 
optimization resulted in increased dye degradation. 
The optimized dye-degradation process was most 
successful for BF, where 97.1% of dye 
decolorization was achieved and minimum 
decolorization 78.1% was found in case of MG. 
The selected dyes for decolorization experiments 
i.e., BF, RB and MG are basic triphenyl methane 
dyes mostly used in textile, pharmaceutical and 
chemical industries; while RB is a cationic 
triphenylmethane dye used in textile industries for 
dying, wool, silk, nylon and cotton. Sometimes it is 
also used in medicine, paper, leather, food, 
cosmetics industries. On other hand, MB is a 
polymeric/ heterocyclic dye used in textile dyeing, 
pharmaceuticals, paper industry and also as a 
biological strain. The great potential of peroxidase 
produced by Bacillus sp. F31 could offer a cheaper 
and efficient alternative treatment of wastewaters 
contaminated heavily with industrial dyes. Further 
extension of work shall comprise the study of the 
combination of the extracted enzyme(s) with other 
established methods for wastewater management to 
see if enzyme alone or in combination with other 
methods m ay be helpful as an industrially efficient 
treatment procedure for efficient dye-degradation. Chaudhary  et al.

 228Conclusion   
In present study the purified peroxidase from 
Bacillus sp. F31 was found to be highly effective in 
decolourisation/degradation of 5 different industrial 
dyes (BF, RB, CBBG, MG and MB). This approach 
will provide an effective application of peroxidase 
in managing industrial effluents containing dyes. 
Proper management of industrial effluents by using 
peroxidase can give environmental and economic 
benefits.
