Viral-prokaryote dynamics greatly influence microbial ecology and the earth’s
biogeochemical cycles. Thus, identifying the key environmental controls on phagepredationis
critical for predictive microbial ecology. Here we conduct laboratory experiments that implicate
ionic strength and carbon composition as major controls on phage interactions with bacterial
hosts in terrestrial microbiomes. We propose a model in which terrestrial phage predation is
most favored in drought impacted soils and in higher ionic strength environments such as
metazoangutsorbetweenadjacentcellsinbiofilms.

Lytic phages can be potent and selective inhibitors of microbial growth and can have
profound impacts on microbiome composition and function. However,thereisuncertaintyabout
the biogeochemical conditions under which phage predation can proceed and modulate
microbial ecosystem function, particularly in terrestrial systems. Ionic strength is known to be
critical for infection of bacteria by many phages, but there is limited quantitative data on ion
thresholds for phage infection that can be compared with environmental ion concentrations.
Similarly, while carbon composition varies in terrestrial environments, we know little of which
carbon sources favorordisfavorphageinfectionandhowthesehigherorderinteractionsimpact
microbiome function. Here, we measured the half-maximaleffectiveconcentrations(EC 50)of80
different inorganic ions for theinfectionof E . c o l iwithtwocanonicaldsDNAandssRNAphages,
T4 and MS2, respectively. We found that many alkaline earth metals and alkalimetalsenabled
successful lytic infection but that the ionic strength thresholds varied for different ions between
phages. Additionally, using a freshwater nitrate reducing microbiome, we found that the ability
of lytic phage to influence nitrate reduction end-products was dependent on the carbon source
as well as the ion concentration. For all phage:host pairs we tested, the ion EC 50s for phage
infection we measured exceed the ion concentrations found in many terrestrial freshwater
systems. Thus, our findings support a model where the influence of phages on terrestrial
microbial functional ecology is greatest in hot spots and hot moments such as metazoan guts,
drought influenced soils, or biofilms where ion concentration is locally or transiently elevated

Bacteriophages are ubiquitous in natural microbial communities and can play important
roles in modulating microbial element cycling [1–7]. However, we lack robust mechanistic
models to enable predictions of phage-host dynamicsandecologicalinteractions,particularlyin
complex environments such as soils and sediments. While some studies have attempted to
demonstrate an impact of phages on soil element cycling, results are variable and apparently
context-dependent [1–5]. As such, the magnitude of the impactofphagepredationonelement
cycling across terrestrial ecosystems and the mechanistic biogeochemistry of this process
remainelusive.
In marine environments, phage lysis is responsiblefor~40-50%ofallbacterialmortality,
approximately equivalent to the contribution of protozoal predation [6]. Carbon released from
dead bacterial cells following phage predation drives a “viral shunt” in the marine carbon cyclewas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

In terrestrial systems, however, the contribution of phage to element cycling dynamics is
much less well characterized and appears to be more variable, particularly in extremely
heterogeneousenvironmentssuchassoils[1–5].
In the absence of a mechanistic model of phage dynamics interrestrialecosystemsitis
difficult to interpret correlations between bacterial:viral ratios and environmental parameters to
identify causal relationships [8]. Several studies have identified strong relationships between
host bacterial blooms and predatory phage in natural systems [9, 10]. It thus follows that
environmental parameters which influence host abundance are important for predatory phage
success. For example, phage abundance can be influenced by the presence of essential
microbial nutrients and energy sources required for host growth [11, 12] with the virus to
microbial ratio increasing with microbial cell density [12]. Thus, in soils, because particles of
detrital carbon or root exudates have higher microbial densities these should be hotspots of
phage predation. Furthermore, the quality of carbon will determine the composition of the
heterotrophic microbial population [13, 14]. It follows that as carbon composition shifts, the
abundance of phage susceptible microbial populations willalsoshifttoalterthepossibleimpact
ofphagesonmicrobialelementcyclingprocesses.
Inorganic ion gradients are also likely to play a major role in phage:host interactions in
terrestrial ecosystems. It has been known for nearly a century that certain alkali metals and
alkaline earth metals including calcium, sodium and magnesium are important for phage
infectivity [15, 16]. This is in part because these cations interact with phage tail fibers to
disaggregate them and enable phage binding to host cell surface receptors [17, 18]. Cations
are also essential to neutralize negatively charged membranes and phage to enable phage
binding [19, 20]. Most phages and bacteria are negatively charged under circumneutral
environmental conditions [21]. For model phage:host pairs, greater than 1 mM Ca2+or Mg2+or
greater than 10-40 mM Na+was required for efficient phage binding [19]. Cations are also
important for phage retention on soil and sediment particles via similar charge neutralization
mechanisms [20, 22, 23]. Membrane fluidity is also influenced by ionic strength [24] and this
may alter phage receptor binding, particularly for phages that bind to outer membrane lipids.
Also, the persistence length of DNA packaged in phages is very sensitive to changes in ionic
strength with more disordered DNA at lower ionic strength likely hampering infectivity [25–27].
Finally, the expression of some phage receptors are induced at higher ionic strength. The T4
phage receptor, OmpC is upregulated at ionic strengths between 10-500 mM [28]andtheMS2
receptor, the type 1 conjugativepilus,issimilarlyupregulatedwithincreasingionicstrength[29].
Thus, there are many indications that there are environmentally relevant ion thresholds below
which phage predation will have a decreased impact on microbiomes. We anticipated that
identifying these thresholds in well controlled laboratory systems would provide valuable
constraintsformodelsofenvironmentalmicrobialecology.
Measuring higher order interactions between geochemical parameters and microbial
ecology requires high-throughput approaches to simulate and recapitulate environmental
conditions under controlled laboratory settings [14, 30, 31]. Bacteria and phages can persist
across broad ranges of ion and carbon complexity and concentration, and some studies have
observed correlations betweenviral:hostdynamicsandenvironmentalparameters[8]. However
we lack detailed mechanistic understanding of how complex natural environmentalgradientsof
carbon and inorganic ions influence phage predation. Furthermore, the use of non-standardwas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

In this study, we hypothesized that the nature and concentration of ions and carbon
sources in a microbial ecosystem are major controls on phage-host dynamics and designed
laboratory experiments to measure these influences on model phage:host interactions. We
used the model interaction between T4 and MS2 phages and E . c o l ihoststoquantifyinorganic
ion thresholds on phage infectivity. We also used a cultured nitrate reducing microbiome from
freshwater aquatic sediment to studythehigherorderinteractionsbetweencarboncomposition,
inorganic ion concentration and lytic phage in controlling microbial element cycling. We found
that microbial community composition and respiratory activity is sensitive to changes in the
composition and concentration of both carbon sources and inorganic ions. Specifically, we
observed that phages can limit the growth and metabolic activity of populations carrying out a
dominantelementcyclingfunction(dissimilatorynitratereductiontoammonium,DNRA),butthat
phage predation is dependent upon both having a carbon source that can be utilized by the
DNRA population and inorganic ion concentrations above that observed in most terrestrial
freshwater environments. Therefore, we propose a mechanistic model in which phage
predation in terrestrial systems occurs predominantly in hotspots where there is sufficientlylow

To quantify the influence of inorganic ions onphage:hostinteractions,wefirstmeasured
the growthoftwomodel E . c o l istrains,BW25113(thehostforthedsDNAphageT4)andC3000
(the host for the ssRNA phage MS2) in the presence of an array of 80 different serially-diluted
inorganic ions using a high-throughput assay platform [30, 31]. We then measured the growth
of these host strains across the inorganic ion array in the presence of their corresponding lytic
phages at a multiplicity of infection (MOI)of1phageperbacterialcell ( F i g u r e 1 A ) . Importantly,
we used an ion-depleted chemically definedmediumforourcontrolculturescontaining~30mM
Na+and sub-millimolar concentrations of other trace minerals and ions. In this ion-depleted
media, E . c o l igrowth was not inhibited by the addition of lytic phage. Thus, we were able to
observe that many inorganic ions displayed similar inhibitory potencies (IC 50) in the presence
and absence of phages ( T a b l e S 1 ). However, several alkali earth metals and alkali metals
displayed a lower half-maximal inhibitory concentration in the presence of phage ( F i g u r e
1 B , 1 C ). These lower inhibitory potencies measured in the presence of phage represent the
effective concentration required for phage infection (EC 50). We also noticed a subtle, but
reproducible increase in the IC 50of Al3+in the presence of T4 phage ( F i g u r e 1 B , 1 C ) . These
results may suggest that phages can protect bacteria from metal toxicity in environments with
highconcentrationsoftransitionmetals.

In general, MS2 phage required a lower ionic
strength than was required for T4 infection ( F i g u r e 1 C , 1 D ) . Of theionsthatenablelyticphage
infection, the monovalent ions required higher concentrations even when correcting for the
difference in ionic strength conferred from the divalent ions ( F i g u r e 1 D ) . For example, Ca2+
EC50were significantly lower than Na+EC50for both MS2 and T4. Others have reported both
specific ion requirements and non-specific ion requirements for phages [35–41]. Compared to
these previous studies, however, our results and methods show clear ion specificity across a
wider range of inorganic species and concentration ranges. As such, our results demonstrate
that phages differ in their ionic strength requirements and that forbothMS2andT4phagesthe
nature of the inorganic ion contributing to ionic strength influences the concentration of ion
necessary for lytic infection. Only a small subset of ions (Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+, Sr2+, Li+) enable

We hypothesized that ionic strength also controls phage:host interactions and microbial
element cycling in more complex microbiomes. To testthishypothesisweusedamodelnitrate
reducing microbial enrichment culture from aquatic freshwater sediment (FN enrichment
culture). This cultured microbiome has diverse heterotrophic bacteria with distinct and varying
respiratory capabilities including both denitrifiers and bacteria capable of dissimilatory nitrate
reduction to ammonium (DNRA). Previously, wehaveusedthismicrobiometodemonstratethat
specific carbon sources can influence the end-products of microbial nitrate reduction by
selectively enriching for microbial strains with particular respiratory enzymatic capabilities [14].
From our previous work [14], we have pure culture isolates from this enrichment including an

Next, we formulated a cocktail of three phage isolates each capable of lytic infection of
one of the dominant DNRA organisms in the enrichment, two C i t r o b a c t e r and one E s c h e r i c h i a ,
and measured the impact of this phage cocktail on ammonium production and strain
composition of the enrichment culture ( F i g u r e 2 , F i g u r e S 2 ). We tested the addition of the
phage cocktail on the enrichment culturerecoveredondifferentcarbonsources/electrondonors
( F i g u r e 2 A ) and found that the impact of phage was greater for some carbon sources than
others ( F i g u r e 2 B , 2 C ). For carbon sources in which the E s c h e r i c h i a or C i t r o b a c t e r strains
dominate, such as D-trehalose, D-glucose or D,L-lactate, the ammonium production was
significantly decreased in the presence ofthelyticphagecocktail(ANOVA,p<0.05) ( F i g u r e 2 B ,

responsive to addition of the lytic phage cocktail. We measured both growth and ammonium
accumulation by these cultures as a function of Na+or Ca2+concentration. Wefoundthatboth

Having measured ion EC 50thresholds for lytic phage infection of bacterial hosts, we
wondered if these concentrations are attained in terrestrial freshwaters. Na+, Ca2+and Mg2+
concentrations in freshwaters vary by over three orders of magnitude from low ionic strength
spring waters [43] to high ionic strength agricultural drainage waters [44] ( F i g u r e 3 ), but ion
concentrations are much higher in bacterial cytoplasm [45], the human gut or seawater [46].
For Na+, none of the freshwaters reached the necessary ion concentrations required for lytic
phage infection we measured ( F i g u r e 3 A ), but Na+concentrations in the bacterial cytoplasm,
human gut or seawater exceed the thresholds for phage infection that we measured. Forboth
Ca2+and Mg2+, a few of the extremely high ionic strength agricultural waters from tile drained
soils reached the ion concentrations required for MS2 infection, but not the concentrations
required for T4 or the freshwaternitratereducingenrichmentculturephagecocktail ( F i g u r e 3 B ,
3 C ). In seawater, Ca2+and Mg2+concentrations exceeded the MS2 phage EC 50and in the
bacterialcytoplasmMg2+concentrationsexceededtheMS2phageEC 50.

Overall, our results along withthoseintheliteratureleadustoproposethatthelowionic
strength in many freshwater environments may limit successful lytic phage infection for the
Enterobacterial phage host:pairs we studied. Incontrast,inmetazoanguts,inbiofilmsadjacent
to recently lysed cells or in estuarine/marine environments, ionic strength is not a limitation on
these phage:host interactions. Our proposal is supported by ion EC 50measured for other soil
and freshwater environmental phagesof B a c i l l u sand R h o d o p s e u d o m o n a s genera[39–41]. For
example, B a c i l l u sphage were shown to require cations above that found in many water

A recent review of diverse phage studies concluded that on average 2.38 mM Ca2+,
5.08 mM Mg2+or ~100 mM Na+were required for efficient infection [32]. All of these
measurements are consistent with the classical theoretical model that neutralization of
membrane charge is required for phage binding and that this takes place >1mM for divalent
cations (e.g. Ca2+or Mg2+) and >10mM for monovalent cations (e.g. Na+) [19, 20]. Importantly,
these concentrations are higher than are found in many freshwaters ( F i g u r e 3 ) . In fact the
global meanCa2+concentrationinfreshwatersis~0.1mManddecreasingduetoanthropogenic
acidification [50]. Notably,whilemostphagelysismediarelyonhighconcentrationsofthelikely
non-physiological ions Ca2+or Mg2+, our data suggests that Na+may actually be a more
important ion for enabling phage infection in many freshwaters because Ca2+or Mg2+
concentrations are often too low to support lytic phage infection. Future work should focus on
measuring ion thresholds for more phage using more standardized techniques as we have
presented in this study to determine the extent to which ions are a controlling factor on their
ecological range. Additionally, assessing the influence of more complex mixtures of inorganic
ions and pH gradients on phage infection using high-throughput approaches as we have
developed in this study will help characterize the complex higher-order interactions between
geochemicalcontextandphage:hostdynamics.

Our suggestion that most freshwaterenvironmentsaresub-optimalforsuccessfulphage
infection ( F i g u r e 3 ) is ostensibly at odds with the prevalence of phage in some terrestrial soils
[51] and lakes [8,52]. However,intheseenvironments,therearelocationsandtimeswhereion
concentrations locally or transiently will exceed the thresholds required for successful
phage:host interactions. We propose that these “hotspots”and“hotmoments”arecriticalsites
of phage infection and should be considered in our conceptual models of phage ecology
( F i g u r e 4 , F i g u r e S 3 ).
In bacterialbiofilms,diffusionofionsfromthecytoplasmofbacterialcellslysedbyphage
will locally maintain sufficient ionic strength for infection of new hosts. We can model the
diffusion of these ions from cells ( F i g u r e 4 A ) . We know the ion concentrations in bacterial
cytoplasms are ~212 mM Na+, 38 mM K+, 0.5 mM Ca2+, 1 mM Mg2+and a cell can be
approximated as a sphere with a radius of one micron. Thus, we can calculate how these
concentrations will decrease if they diffuse evenly intolargervolumes. Ouranalysisshowsthat
beyond ~1 micron distance from lysed cells, the concentration of Na+will drop below the EC 50
for successful lytic infection by T4 phage ( F i g u r e 4 A ) . This suggests that phage blooms in
biofilms are propagated by very local diffusion dynamics between adjacent cells. Interestingly,
T4 phage begins to aggregate at concentrations near the lytic infection EC 50for Na+[17]. As
phage aggregates are more stable to environmental stressors, this may suggest a mechanism
phage have evolved to survive outside of bacterial hosts at low ionic strength wheninfectionis
disfavored.

Na+and K+salts are much more soluble and as such, the concentration of
these ions will increase linearly with theconcentrationfactor(Concentrationfactoristheratioof

means that ⅓ of the original water remains). Ion concentrations in the evaporation of atypical
spring water (Sierra Nevada mountain springwater, CA) have been modeled [53] and whenwe
overlay T4 phage EC 50ontheionconcentrationprofilesweobservethatbetween100-1000fold
concentrationofthiswaterisnecessaryforphagetoinfect.
Thus, from our results and literature precedent, we propose a model in which phage
infection proceeds when ionic strength is locally or transiently elevated ( F i g u r e 4 C ) . Some
recent field observationsareconsistentwithourmodel.Metagenomicsurveysofsoilssuggesta
strong influence of soil moisture on viral ecological dynamics [54–56]. For example, a strong
distance-decay relationship was observed in similarity between viral populations across a
grassland field site [54]. This could be explained by the strong limitations onviraldispersalwe
anticipate when freshwater ion concentrations are too low to enable infection. Other studies
have observed a strong influence of soil moisture content on the viral community content [55],
but this may reflect the well established influence of drought on microbial community
composition [57, 58]. Other field data support our model implicating a direct role of drought in
controlling phage infection. Recently, in a timecourse from a soil undergoing rewetting after a
period of drought, phage DNA was observed in the firsthoursafterarainevent[59]. Basedon
our observations, this rapid phage bloom can best be explained by phage infection occurring
during the early phases of the drought when host metabolismisslowing,withphagereplication
happening upon rewetting facilitated by the revival of host bacterial metabolism. Careful
fieldwork to measure soil porewater ion concentrations and phage:host dynamics over a
completewet-dry-wetcyclewouldbehelpfultofurthersupportthishypothesis.
Another feature of our conceptual model of phage predation is that the enrichment of
non-host bacteria will decrease the probability of productive phage:host interactions. Our
experiments with varying carbon sources provide support for this model. We observed that
when S u l f u r o s p i r i l l u m or K l e b s i e l l a were enriched in our cultures the predatory efficiency ofthe
E s c h e r i c h i a and C i t r o b a c t e r phage was decreased as well as the phage impact on DNRA
activity. It follows that prebiotic nutrient amendments are potentially important to enhance the
efficacy of phage cocktails, and that as carbon complexity increases (e.g. in soils) phage
predation is likely to be less important in mediating microbiome composition and function. We
anticipate that furtherworktoassesshownutrientcomplexityinfluencesphage:hostinteractions

Understanding the environmental controls on phage ecology is essential for a predictive
understanding of the impact of the viral fraction on biogeochemical cycling in terrestrial
ecosystems. Furthermore, as there is optimism about the use of phage and other genetic
editing technologies to control and manipulate microbial ecosystems, it is importanttoconsider
the conditions under which phage-based microbiome engineering will be successful. With
improvements in our ability to simulate the higher order interactions between environmental

isolation protocol [61]. Phage titer was estimated by spotting 10-fold serial dilution of each
phage in SM buffer (Teknova) on alawnoftargethostusingtopagaroverlaymethodwith0.7%

To measure the influence of carbon sources on the end-products of the archivednitrate
reducing microbial communities,cellsfromrecoveredenrichmentcultureswerepelletedat4000
RCF and washed three times with 2x concentrated basal medium lacking a carbon source.
Washed cells were resuspended in 2x concentrated basal medium lacking a carbon source to
an optical density (OD 600) of 0.04 and thecellsuspensionwastransferredintoeither384well
microplates (Costar) or 96 deep-well blocks (Costar) in which 94 carbon sources and water
controls were arrayed (Table S1). Carbon source stock solutions were added to microplates
using a Biomek FxP liquid handling robot (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis,IN,USA)andkeptin
an anaerobic chamber (Coy, Coy Lab Products, Grass Lake, MI, USA) for 48 hours tobecome
anoxic prior to inoculation using an Avidien Micropro 200 pipettor (Mettler-Toledo, Columbus,
OH USA). Inoculated microplates were sealedwithsiliconmicroplateseals(VWR,Radnor,PA)
and incubated at 30 ºC in an incubator in ananaerobicchamber(COY).Growthwasmonitored
by optical density (OD 600) using a Tecan M1000 Pro microplate reader (Tecan Group Ltd.,
Männendorf, Switzerland) and cultures were harvested at 48 hours for DNA sequencing and

To measure the influence of inorganic ions on the efficacy of the phage cocktail, phage
were dialyzed into low ionic strength buffer as described above and mixed with the washed
enrichment culture and cultures containing 20 mMD-trehaloseand20mMsodiumnitrateinthe

Ammonium production was measured as previously described [14]. Microplate seals
were removed from 384-well microplates containing enrichment cultures and a Biomek FxP
(Beckman Coulter) was used to transfer 4 µLofculturetoassaymicroplatesprefilledwith20 µL
of distilled deionized. Insequentialorder,4 µLofcitratereagent,8 µLofsalicylate/nitroprusside
reagent, and 4 µL bleach reagent were added toassayplateswhichwerethenkeptat30 °Cfor
30 min. Citrate reagent contains 10 g trisodium citrate and 4 g sodium hydroxide in 200 mL
water. Salicylate/nitroprusside reagent contains 15.626 g sodium salicylate and 0.250 g sodium
nitroprusside in 200 mL water at pH 6–7. Bleach reagent contains 1 g sodium phosphate
monobasic, 2 mL 2 M sodium hydroxide, 10 mL bleach (0.7 M NaOCl, Chlorox Company,
Pleasanton, CA, USA) in 100 mL water at pH 12–13. For all colorimetric assays, we confirmed
that interference of media additives (carbon sources and inorganic ions) was negligible. Using
constants obtained from the BioNumbers database [62], we estimated the quantity of nitrogen
assimilated into biomass by assuming 0.3 g/L of dry weight of bacterial culture at OD 600 = 1
[63, 64], and by assuming 12% nitrogen by weight in microbial biomass based on measured
C:N:Pratios[65,66].

For DNA extraction microbial cells from 500 µL cultures were pelleted by centrifugation
at 4000 RCF after 48 hours of growth at 30°C. DNA (gDNA) extractions were performed as
follows. Cell pellets were resuspended in 180 µL enzymatic lysis buffer (ELB) which contains
20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM sodium EDTA (TE) with 1.2% Triton X-100. 20 𝜇Llyzosyme(25
mg/mL) was added andthesamplesincubatedovernightat37°C. Thefollowingmorning20 𝜇L
of proteinase K (20 mg/mL) and 200 µL 4M guanidinium HCL were added and the samples
incubated overnight at 55 °C. The following morning 4 µL RNAse A (100 mg/mL) was added
and samples incubated for 2 hrs at room temperature. 200 µL of ethanol was added to
precipitate DNA and samples were then applied to 96 well silica membrane plates (BPI-Tech,
San Diego, CA, USA). DNA bound to membranes was washed twice with 400 µL 70%
ethanol:TE and eluted in 100 µL TE. An Avidien Micropro 200 (Avidien) was used to transfer
large volumes of buffers and multichannel pipettes (Rainin) used to apply samples to 96 well
columns and add low volume reagents. A vacuum manifold (Qiagen,RedwoodCity,CA,USA)
was used to perform column purification steps. Extractionsusingthismethodwerefoundtobe
similar in terms of DNA yield and recovery to using the Gene QIAamp96DNAQIAcubeHTKit
(Qiagen).
gDNA template was added to a PCR reaction to amplify the V4/V5 16S gene region
using the 515F/ 926R primers based on the Earth Microbiome Project primers [67, 68]butwith
in-line dual Illumina indexes [69, 70]. The amplicons were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq
(Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) at the QB3 Genomics facility (QB3 Genomics, UC Berkeley,
Berkeley, CA, RRID:SCR_022170) with 2x300 bp Ilumina v3 reagents. Reads were processed
with custom Perl scripts implementing Pear for read merging [71], USearch [72] for filtering
reads with more than one expected error, demultiplexing using inline indexes and Unoise [73]
for filtering rare reads and chimeras. 16S sequences in the relative abundance table were
searched against theRDPdatabase[74]toassigntaxonomy. Thefunctionalcapacityfornitratewas not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

phage predation bacterial hosts are grown in an ion-depletedchemicallydefinedmediuminthe
presence and absence of phage and in the presenceandabsenceofanarrayofinorganicions
serially diluted in microplates. Half maximal inhibitory concentrations are quantified in the
presence and absence of phage to identify ion toxicity thresholds (IC 50) and ion thresholds
required for phage infection (EC 50). B .Growth of E . c o l iBW25113 cultures at 12 hours as
measured by optical density (OD 600) in the presence (closed symbols) or absence (open

lacking phage or additional ions. C .Comparison of selected ion IC 50or phage-ion EC 50for E .

Conceptual model for phage infection. Ionic strength in freshwater environments is too low to
promote phage infection. Higher ionic strength is found in metazoan guts or brackish/marine
waters and transiently observed in drought influenced soils or in a biofilm adjacent to a lysed
cell. When other strains (blue) are present, such as when the dominant electrondonor/carbon
sourceorothernichedimensionsshift,fewerproductivephage:hostinteractionswillproceed.
