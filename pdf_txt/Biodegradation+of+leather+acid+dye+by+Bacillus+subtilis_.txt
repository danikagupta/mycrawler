Abstract: Azo dyes are widely used in textile industries. Removal of the col or from textile waste water is a
striking issue. To curb this issue, biological treatment can be employed rather than physico - chemical processes.
In this work, Bacillus subtilis  is used to degrade the reactive dye – RED M5B. It is found that decolorizatio n
was due the action of enzyme peroxidase produced by the organisms during its growth. Optimum conditions for
the dye degradation were indentified using response surface methodology. Under optimal conditions, 95%
degradation was observed within 40 h of ino culation.
Keywords: Azo dyes, biodegradation, reactive dyes, Bacillus subtilis, RSM.
Introduction
Textile effluent treatment is of due significance
owing to their polluting effects on water bodies1.
Human health and ecological effects have made this
a burning issue. Dye removal from wastewater is a
difficult task and expensive2. Complete degradation
of dye into non -harmful state or form is essential3.
Different methods employed in dye removal include
membrane filtration, coagulation, flocculation,
precipitation, floatation, adsorption, ion -exchange,
ion-pair extraction, ultrasonic mineralization,
electrolysis etc. These operations prove to be
expensive, time consuming and not effective to a
complete degree4.To resolve these limitations
biological treatmen ts are employed. These methods
use bacteria5, fungi6, algae7, actinomycetes8 and
other aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms.
Biological degradation of azo dyes contains two
major steps9. Firstly, oxidation -reduction reactions
cause cleavage of azo bond. Th e second stepinvolves oxidation of intermediate. The product
from this step is less toxic, colorless and in
acceptable form in comparison to the initial state.
This was found out to be due to the presence of non -
specific extracellular enzymes formed durin g the
growth of microorganism10. Between aerobic and
anaerobic degradation, aerobic degradation is very
effective since it oxidizes the reduced components to
further lesser toxic state. Hence, aerobic degradation
is the safe method over anaerobic degradati on.
Response surface methodology was used to optimize
bacterial decolorization process.
Materials and methods:
Microorganisms and media employed :Bacillus
subtiliswas purchased from MTCC, Chandighar,
and was grown on Nutrient agar plates. The mother
culture was then stored at 4 °C. The media used for
sub-culturing and decolorization contained: 0.5 %V. Ponnusami  et al /Int.J.ChemTech Res.201 3,5(1) 132
Peptone, 0.1 % beef extract, 0.2% yeast extract,
0.5% NaCl in 1 L of distilled water.
Reactive dye employed : The reactive dye employed
was RED M5B. It is a  commercial dye widely used
by textiles industries near Tirupur, India. It was used
in this study without further purification. 100 ml of
dye solutions of concentrations 100 ppm, 200 ppm
and 300 ppm were prepared to which nutrient media
components (as ment ion above) were added. The
flasks were sterilized and were inoculated with the
organism under aseptic conditions. Samples were
taken at regular time intervals and centrifuged at
6000 rpm for 10 min to separate the cells.
Supernatant was taken and analyzed for residual red
M5B using Uv -vis spectrophotometer at its λmax(540
nm).When the absorbance exceeded 1.2 the samples
were suitably diluted. Decolourization was studied
and percent decolourization was found using the
formula2:

Peroxidase Assay11: 1 mL of crude enzyme is
extracted from the sample and centrifuged at 6000
rpm for 10 min followed by addition of 1 ml of
methylene blue dye solution of 20 ppm and
incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. The change in color
to green shows the pr esence of peroxidase enzyme
and it is quantitatively measured at 662 nm using
UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The amount of enzyme

Results a nd discussion
Figure 1 shows the degradation effect of Bacillus
subtilis on red M5B dye of three different
concentrations at pH 7 and 30 ºC. Percentage
decolorization is in the range of 90 -95%.
Response Surface Methodology:
Optimization of process vari ables was carried out by
employing response surface methodology (RSM).
The RSM procedure comprised of variation of
parameters such as salt concentration, pH and dye
concentration. Several researchers had shown thatinitial dye concentration and pH influenc e the
biodegradation efficiency. Most of the research
reports on biodegradation of textile dyes use
synthetic dye solution. However, industrial effluents
contains considerable amount of salts like sodium
chloride. Thus, this work investigates the
biodegrad ation efficiency in the presence of
common salt. Experimental conditions along with
the results are shown in table 2. The results were
analyzed using Minitab 15. A quadratic model was
employed to explain the variation in the response
variable percentage co lor removal with the
independent variables namely, pH, initial dye
concentration and salt concentration12-15. Estimated
regression coefficients along with their t - and p-
values are given in table 2. From the p -values it was
found that the factors ‘pH2’, ‘pH×salt’ and
‘dye×salt’ were not statistically significant (p -value
> 0.05 at 95% confidence level) and hence they were
eliminated from the quadratic model and regression
was repeated. The model could explain 87.78% (R2
= 0.8778) variations in the response  variable. All the
regression coefficients included in the reduced
model were found to be statistically significant with
p-values less than 0.05. In order to confirm the
validity of the model ANOVA was performed and
the results are listed in table 3. p -value of lack of fit
for the reduced model was found to be 0.036 ( p <
0.05). Therefore, presence of outliers was tested
using residual graphs (graphs not shown here) and it
was found that experimental points 34 and 36 could
be possible outliers. These two ex perimental results
were removed and regression and ANOVA were
performed again. Results are shown in table 2 and
table 3 respectively. Both lack -of-fit and R2 values
had increased confirming that the points 34 and 36
were real outliers. R2 for the reduced m odel without
outlier was 0.9164 indicating that the model could
explain 91.64% of variations in the response
variable. By substituting the coefficient in the
regression model following equation is obtained.

Conclusion
A commercial dye Red M5B was degraded using
strainBacillus subtilis  in submerged fermentation.
The results indicated that the strain used was
efficient in degrading the dye and upto 95% color
could be removed. Effect of process variables
namely initial solution pH, dye concentration andV. Ponnusami  et al /Int.J.ChemTech Res.201 3,5(1) 133
salt concentration were studied by response surface
methodology and it was found that all these
variables had influenced percentage color removal.
A quadratic m odel was proposed to explain the
variation in the response variable with respect to
these process variables and the model was found to
be satisfactory with high R2 value (0.9164). RSM
also revealed the interaction between the variables.
