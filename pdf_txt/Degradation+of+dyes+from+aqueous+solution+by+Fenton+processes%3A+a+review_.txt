Abstract – As environmental preservation becomes a 
significant so cietal issue and more stringent laws on 
effluent discharge are enacted, more effective 
techniques to deal with non -biodegradable and 
harmful contaminants are necessary. Synthetic organic 
dyes in industrial effluents cannot be eliminated by 
standard wastewa ter treatment, making the 
development of new environmentally friendly methods 
capable of entirely mineralizing these non -
biodegradable chemicals an essential task. In 
comparison to traditional wastewater treatment 
technologies, advanced oxidation processes  (AOPs) 
have developed as effective, promising, and 
environmentally acceptable approaches for the 
treatment of wastewater with high levels of pollutants 
in recent years. AOPs have turned into a significant 
avenue of technology for treating resistant pollut ants 
via several paths such as "Enhanced Electrolysis," 
"Ultraviolet radiation," and "Ozonation.",  "Sonolysis," 
etc. Many AOPs  rely on the production of powerful 
oxidants in situ, such as hydroxyl radicals, which  can 
totally mineralize or destroy organic c ontaminants. 
This review study focuses on numerous research on 
the Electro -Fenton technique for treating industrial 
wastewater. The investigation of several parameters 
that influence the Electro -Fenton process, such as pH, 
current density, applied voltage,  hydrogen peroxide 
concentration, and interfacial tension , The distance between the electrodes, the rate of oxygen sparging, 
and the temperature have all been investigated. This 
paper examines the Electro -Fenton process in depth, 
including its basic concep t, mechanism, benefits, and 
drawbacks, in order to get a better scientific knowledge 
of how to treat industrial wastewater.   
Key Words :  Advanced oxidation processes , Electro -
Fenton process , Wastewater treatment , Hydroxyl 
radicals.  
 
1. INTRODUCTION   
Indust rial wastewater treatment is a popular issue 
among scientists around the world, as it poses a 
significant threat to air, soil, and aquatic life, as well as 
human and animal health (Boczkaj et al. 2017). 
Industrial wastewater with high BOD, COD, color, 
reca lcitrant/toxic compounds, heavy metals, and other 
pollutants is discharged from a variety of industries, 
including dyes, textiles, distilleries, paper and pulp, 
tanning, leather manufacturing, and breweries 
(Chandra and Kumar, 2015, 2018), where convention al 
treatment fails to remove all pollutants from the 
effluent due to inefficiency, high operation costs, and 
feasibility of treatment (Chandra and Kumar, 2015, 
2018). (Scott and Ollis, 1995). The properties and 
content of industrial effluent differ dependi ng on the 
industry, and no uniform method/technology exists.  
Because it is mostly dependent on the concentration 
and kind of contaminants present in the effluent, it is www.ijcspub.org                                    © 2022 IJCSPUB | Volume 12, Issue 3 September  2022 | ISSN: 2250 -1770

 viable to treat. Since the previous decade, the 
government has enacted legislation that  restricts and 
regulates pollutant emissions, resulting in a significant 
growth in the number of research and businesses 
dealing with industrial wastewater treatment.  
Furthermore, because the effluent comes from a 
variety of sectors such as textiles, pharm aceuticals, and 
chemicals, the quality and amount of the effluent is 
always changing, and the inflow properties of the 
wastewater vary according  to the company and its 
procedures. As a result, the treatment of mixed 
wastewater has gotten a lot of attention . Furthermore, 
because the effluent contains some non -biodegradable 
recalcitrant chemicals, further treatment is not an 
option (Roshini et al., 2017) . As a result, Advanced 
Oxidation Processes (AOPs) are gaining traction as a 
cost -effective way to remove h azardous, recalcitrant, 
and non -biodegradable substances from wastewater 
(Gogate and Pandit, 2004; Bagal and Gogate, 2014; 
Oturan and Aaron, 2014; Nidheesh, 2015, 2017). 
EAOPs have played an important role in wastewater 
treatment during the last decade sin ce they have a 
tendency to remove a variety of organic contaminants 
from wastewater (Rodrigo et al., 2014; Vasudevan and 
Oturan, 2014; Nidheesh et al., 2018).  
There are different EAOPs like anodic oxidation 
(Ammar et al., 2012; Murati et al., 2012; Trellu et al., 
2017), electro -Fenton process ( Özcan et al., 2009; 
Oturan et al., 2015), peroxi -coagulation process 
(Nidheesh and Gandhimathi, 2014; Nidheesh, 2018), 
bioelectro -Fenton (Olvera -Vargas et al., 2016b, 2016a), 
electroperoxone (Wang, 2017; Yang et al.,  2018) etc. 
The main benefit of EAOPs is its affinity towards the 
environment which is due to the electron as the main 
reagent (Peralta -Hernández et al., 2009).  
 Brillas et al., 2009; Zcan et al., 2009; Nidheesh and 
Gandhimathi, 2012) regard the electro -Fenton (EF) 
process to be one of the most significant EAOPs. The EF 
method was chosen for this investigation because of its 
quick reaction time, the creation of hydroxyl radicals by in -situ electro regeneration of H2O2 and Fe2+, the 
absence of H2O2 transit c osts, the low cost of Fenton's 
reagent, and other factors (Nidheesh and Gandhimathi, 
2012). When used to decompose organic contaminants 
from mixed industrial effluent, the EF process has 
proven to be an effective method.  
The EF method is a new innovation i n the realm of 
industrial wastewater treatment since it allows for full 
mineralization of pollutants without creating harmful 
byproducts in the system. In that respect, the current 
study focuses on the basic mechanics of the EF process 
as well as the param eters impacting the treated 
effluent produced by the EF process in order to tackle 
the refractory contaminants found in industrial 
wastewater.  
2. Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs)  
 
Initially, AOPs were proposed to deal with potable 
water treatment, but t hey have since evolved into 
effective treatment methods for eliminating refractory, 
low biodegradable, highly chemical stable, and 
inhibiting contaminants from wastewater (Kumar et at 
2021). The AOPs study the process of in situ formation 
of oxidant specie s such as hydroxyl radicals (OH. ), 
which are extremely reactive in the reaction. The OH. 
radical is a non -selective radical , ubiquitous in nature , 
powerful and has an oxidation potential of 2.8  V. The 
The presence of radicals in the system degrades 
organi c contaminants in four ways: abstraction of 
hydrogen, electron transfer, radical addition, and 
radical combination. The produced OH. radical aids in 
the mineralization and degradation of organic 
contaminants, as well as their transformation into CO2, 
H2O, and a small quantity of inorganic ions (Eq.1) 
(Kumar et al 2021).

                        (1) 
The reactive agents can be produced with the help of 
different processes like Fenton based oxi dation, 
photocatalysis, sonolysis, ozone -based oxidation and www.ijcspub.org                                    © 2022 IJCSPUB | Volume 12, Issue 3 September  2022 | ISSN: 2250 -1770

 also by combining various processes like peroxone 
(O3/H 2O2), peroxone coupled with ultraviolet light (O 3/ 
H2O2/UV), Fenton ( H2O2/Fe2+), O3/TiO 2/ H2O2, etc. 
(Fig.1).

3. Principle of  Electro -Fenton Process  
 
 
Apart from many other methods, the EF technique has 
been widely employed to reduce persistent organic 
compounds throughout the previous decade. EF is a 
popular  treatment method due to its quick pollutant 
removal rate, greater degradation rate for persistent 
organic pollutant elimination, and environmental 
compatibility (Oturan et al., 2000; Brillas et al., 2009). 
The electro -generation of Fenton's reagent in the  
electrochemical cell produces hydroxyl radical in this 
procedure.  
As shown in Figure 2, when reduction of O 2 electron 
occurs in the acidic medium, on the surface of cathode 
there is generation of hydrogen peroxide (Oturan et al., 
2008a; Nidheesh and Gandh imathi, 2012). A continuous 
oxygen source is required nearby cathode to generate 
hydrogen peroxide in the electrochemical cel l (Eq. 2 ). 
When ferrous ions in the form of catalyst is added in the 
solution it leads to the forma tion of OH. according to 
(Eq. 3 ). 
 O2 + 2H+ + 2e-  H2O2

Fe2+ + H 2O2  Fe3+ + OH- + OH. 
 (3)          
Main Pros of the EF process are as follows 
(GemaPliegoa  et al., 2015):  
 Complete minera lization and degradation of 
pollutants can be achieved.  
 No transportation cost for H2O2OH. is 
produced in the electrochemical cell by in -situ 
electro regeneration of H2O2 and Fe2+ 
 
The Cons of the EF process are as follows ( GemaPliegoa  
et al., 2015):  
 The p rocess is operated in acidic conditions 
(pH-2 to 3)  
 Higher operational and maintenance cost is 
required  
 The EF process is linked with the concentration 
polarization in the electrodes

IJCSP22C1210  International Journal of Current Science (IJCSPUB) www.ijcspub.org  760 
 4.1 Effect of  pH 
 
One of the most essential elements in the E -Fenton 
process is the pH. In general, the Fenton reaction was 
carried out in an acidic environment. The ideal pH of 
the Fenton reaction, according to most research, is 
about 3. (Ghonei m et al. 2011; Zhou et al 2007; Wang et 
al. 2008; Mei et al. 2007). In the traditional Fenton  
process, iron species begin to precipitate as ferric 
hydroxides at higher pH values. On the other hand, iron 
species form stable complexes with H2O2 at lower pH 
values, leading to deactivation of catalysts. 
Consequently, the oxidation effici ency dramatically 
decreases ( Wang et al. 2010 ). At higher pH, the 
efficiency of E -Fenton process decreases  rapidly, 
especially pH> 5. This is due to the fact that H2O2 is 
unstab le in basic solution. H2O2 rapidly decomposes to 
oxygen and water at neutral to high pH with rate 
constant of 2.3 × 10−2 and 7.4× 10−2 min−1 at pH 7. 0 
and 10.5, respectively ( Shemer et al. 2006; Wang et al. 
2001 ).  
 
4.2 Effect of Oxygen sparging rate  
 
Because raising the oxygen sparging rate can raise the 
dissolved  oxygen concentration and mass transfer rate 
of dissolved oxygen, and therefore increase the 
formation of hydrogen peroxide, oxygen is one of the 
primary parameters that limits the performance of the 
Electro -Fenton system (Wang et al. 2010). Chen and Lin 
(2009) found that the electrochemical oxidation of TOC 
corresponds well with the hydrogen peroxide produced 
at the cathode, and that at a flow rate of 100 mL/min, 
the saturation solubility of oxygen in wastewater is 
almost obtained.  However, even when the o xygen 
sparging rate was raised from 0.3 to 0.4 L/min, the 
colour removal efficiency remained nearly constant at a 
current density of 68 A/m2. 2008, Wang et al. The 
results show that when the oxygen sparging rate 
exceeded 0.3 L/min, color  removal became gov erned by 
the kinetics of hydrogen peroxide formation (Wang et al. 2008). Wang et al. (2010) observed similar findings 
following the same procedure.  The oxygen sparging 
rate was over 150 L/min for COD removal.  
 
4.3 Effect of Temperature  
Although temperature  has a beneficial influence on 
Fenton and related processes, the increase in organic 
compound elimination owing to temperature is minimal 
in comparison to the other parameters. Temperatures 
that are either low or too high have a detrimental 
influence on th e efficiency of the operation. Guedes et 
al. (2003) found that a temperature of 30 °C is best for 
the breakdown of cork cooking wastewater. Because of 
the considerably better treatment efficacy in this 
temperature range, temperatures between 20 and 30 °C 
can be regarded as an ideal range (Umar et al. 2010). 
The COD removal effectiveness of the Fenton process 
rose marginally as the temperature climbed from 15 to 
36 °C, according to Zhang et al. 2005 . According to 
Wang (2008), the rate of dye degradation was slower at 
low temperatures and the level of deterioration was 
greater before 100 minutes at 20 –30 °C.  
 
4.4 Effect of Applied current density  
 
At the cathode, the supplied current drives the 
reduction of oxygen, resulting in the production of 
hydrogen perox ide. Higher applied current produces 
more hydrogen peroxide, which leads to a rise in the 
amount of hydroxyl radicals in the electrolyte medium, 
which are extremely reactive and responsible for 
deterioration (Sankara et al. 2003). An electrochemical 
system  with a greater applied current density will have 
a higher applied voltage (Wang et al. 2010). At 
increasing current density efficiencies, E -efficiency 
Fenton's will be reduced. Because of this,  the 
electrolytic cell's competitive electrode reactions 
Accor ding to some research, the current density in the 
E-Fenton process should not exceed 10 A/m2, while 
others say the top limit should be 6.4 A/m2 (Zhang et al. 
2004).  www.ijcspub.org                                    © 2022 IJCSPUB | Volume 12, Issue 3 September  2022 | ISSN: 2250 -1770  
IJCSP22C1210  International Journal of Current Science (IJCSPUB) www.ijcspub.org  761 
 4.5 Fe2+ Concentration  
 
The quantity of Fenton reagent is a key factor in 
determining how many hydroxyl radicals are produced 
and how efficient Fenton processes are. The ratio of 
hydrogen peroxide to iron species concentration is a 
crucial parameter in every Fenton process, and there is 
an ideal ratio between these Fenton's reagents for 
maximal  hydroxyl radical generation (Brillaset al. 2009; 
Nidheesh and Gandhimathi 2014b). The rate of 
hydrogen peroxide produced in the EF process is 
constant and is dependent on voltage, cathode material, 
and other parameters.  ozcan and colleagues . the early 
phases of electrolysis, 2008a noticed a rapid 
electroproduction  of H2O2, but after that, the H2O2 
accumulation rate reduced and reached a steady -state 
value when the generation rate at the cathode and the 
decomposition rate at the anode were equal. In an 
elec trolytic system, this phenomenon  is extremely 
difficult to manage. As a result, the generation of 
hydroxyl radicals in the EF process is more dependent 
on the quantity of iron species.  
 
4.6 Distance between the electrodes  
 
Another key aspect that impacts t he removal of 
pollutants in the E -Fenton process is the distance 
between electrodes. The ohmic drop process is reduced 
when the distance between the electrodes is reduced. 
through the electrolyte, resulting in a reduction in cell 
voltage and energy usage ( Fockedey et al. 2002). 
According to Zhang et al. (2006), the COD removal 
efficiency from landfill leachate remained constant at 
electrode distances of 1.3 to 2.1 cm. For shorter or 
longer distances, the E -Fenton system's removal 
efficiency was lower. When the electrodes were put too 
close together, electro -regenerated Fe2+ might easily 
oxidize  to ferric ion at the anode (Zhang et al. 2006). 
The limiting mass transfer of ferric ions  to the cathode 
surface, which limits ferrous ion regeneration, is caused 
by a longer distance (Zhang et al. 2006). According to Atmaca (2009), alterations in the spacing between the 
electrodes have a negligible impact on treatment 
effectiveness.  
 
5. CONCLUSION AND WAY FORWARD  
 
Although extensive study has been done to protect the 
entire ecosystem from being harmed, one of the issues 
that today's world faces is the correct disposal and 
effective treatment of industrial wastewater. AOPs and 
their various combinations, on the other hand, have 
shown to be an effective treatment method for dealing 
with the resistant qualities of wastewater generated by 
diverse industries. They've been used in pilot and 
bench scale studies. However, commercial and long -
term application is problematic since these 
technologies consume a lot of energy and ar e expensive 
to maintain and operate . As a result, attempts are being 
made to assess the benefits and drawbacks of 
implementing it on a large scale in various businesses. 
In the recent decade, the use of E -Fenton to remove 
organic pollutants from wastewater  has gotten a lot of 
attention. Various types of electrolytic reactors were 
investigated.  employed in the E -Fenton research The 
future scope of the EF process will be determined by 
the collaboration of engineers, electrochemists, and 
chemists in order to e nsure that these technologies can 
be applied and used at a field size.
