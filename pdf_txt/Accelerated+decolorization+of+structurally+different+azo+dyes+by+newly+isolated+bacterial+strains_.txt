 Abstract.-  The present study is aimed at assessing the ability of Corynebacterium  sp. to decolorize and degrade 
dyes into non-toxic form. Corynebacterium  sp. could tolerate Reactive Blac k5 and Yellow15 up to 10 mg/ml. The 
maximum growth of ba cterium was observed at 37ºC and at pH 7.  Corynebacterium  sp. showed high azoreductase 
activity against Reactive Black5 (68%) and Reactive Yellow15 (80%). Corynebacterium  sp. could decolourize 60% 
(Reactive Black5) and 76% (Reactive Yellow15) from the medium containing 100 µg/ml after 2 and 4 days, 
respectively. The additional bands in TLC chromatograms after decolourization of the dyes showed that the dyes were 
degraded by the bacterium when compared with the undeco lourized dyes. The presence of extra bands in TLC in 
decolourized samples indicates the ability of the bacteriu m to degrade dyes enzymatically and can be exploited for 
bioremediation of azo dyes and their deri vates containing wastes, sin ce it seem to have the potential to degrade the 
toxic azo dyes into non-toxic product form. 
 
Keywords:  Azo dyes, decolourization, Corynebacterium  sp., bioremediation. 
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
 Textile dyes are chemicals with complex 
aromatic structures designed to resist the effects of 
laundering and sunshine, for example (Nigam et al.,  
2000). A great number of dyes and other chemicals are used in textile wet processing. There are more than 105 commercially available dyes with over 
1×10
6 ton of dyestuff produced annually world-wide 
(Pandey et al.,  2007). Among these available dyes, 
azo dyes constitute about 70% of all known 
dyestuffs in the world an d represent 70% of total 
dyes produced per year, thus making them the largest and the most important group of synthetic 
colorants released into the environment (Carliell et 
al., 1998; Robinson et al.,  2001; Selvam et al.,  
2003; Ambrosio and Campos-Takaki, 2004). 
 Dyes-particularly reactive dyes-usually have 
a synthetic origin and complex aromatic molecular 
structures, which make them stable and difficult to 
biodegrade. Reactive dyes differ from all other dye classes in that they bind to  textile fibers, such as 
cellulose and cotton, through covalent bonds (O’Mahony et al., 2002). Reactive dyes are typically

reactivity. The recalcitrance of azo dyes has been 
attributed to the presence of sulfonate groups and azo bonds, two features generally considered as xenobiotic (Rieger et al.,  2002; Lee and 
Pavlostathis, 2004). 
 The industrial manufacturing of azo dyes and textile finishing processes generate wastewater streams contaminated with azo dyes. Some of the azo dyes are difficult to treat by conventional wastewater treatment methods. Compared with physical and chemical methods, biological 
techniques are preferable because of economical 
advantages and low possibility of by products production. Screening potential microorganisms is a critical step in the construction of an effective remediation system. 
 At present, a number of studies have focused on microorganisms, which are able to decolourize and biodegrade these dyes. Several combined anaerobic and aerobic microbial treatments have been suggested to enhance the degradation of azo dyes (O’Neill et al ., 2000). Alternatively, dye 
decolorization using microbial enzymes has received great attention in recent years due to its efficient application (Abadulla et al., 2000; Claus et 
al., 2002; Zille et al ., 2003; Couto et al ., 2005). U. AFTAB ET AL. 2

microorganisms have two different sim ultaneous

2001;  Ozer et al.,  2005; Khalaf, 2008). I
 The present study  deals with the isolation of 
azo dy es degrading bacteriu m fr om a dy es

reactive dy es into non-toxic pr oduct and  
optim ization of tem peratu re and pH for maximum

water. The pH of the medium was adjusted to 7. Medium (5 ml) was dispensed in each test tube and was autoclaved. Inoculation was done by adding 
200 µl of log phase of actively growing bacterial 
isolates in the test tubes. After 24 hours of 
incubation, 2-3 drops of reagent 1 (0.8 % sulfanilic acid prepared in 5N acetic acid) was added. Then 2-3 drops of reagent 2 (0.6 % Dimethyl-alpha-naphthylamine prepared in 5N acetic acid) were 
added to the test tubes. Red colour indicates the 
positive reaction while the colourless reaction is considered as negative.

for 24 hours at 37ºC and finally examined for 
evidence of casein hydrolysis.

 For optimum growth of the bacterial i
two parameters i.e., temperature and pH were 
considered. For determination of optimum 
temperature, 5 ml LB broth was added in 4 sets, 
each of three test tubes, autoclaved and inoculated with 50 µl of freshly prepared culture of each bacterial isolate by overnight growth at 37ºC in LB broth. The four sets of tubes were incubated at 20ºC, 
30ºC, 37ºC and 45ºC. After an incubation period of 
12 h, their absorbance was measured at 600 nm 
using a λ  650 UV/Vis Spectrophotometer 
(PerkinElmer, USA). For determination of optimum 
pH, test tubes having 5 ml LB broth were prepared 
in 9 sets, each containing 3 test tubes and their pH was adjusted at 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0 and 10 then autoclaved. These tubes were inoculated with 50 µl freshly prepared culture of bacterial isolate. After an incubation period of 12 h, their absorbance was 
measured at 600 nm.

determined in minimal salt medium with (100 µg/ml 
of Reactive Black5 and Yellow15) and without dyes 
(control). For bacterial isolate 50 ml medium was taken in one set consisting of 3 flasks, autoclaved and then inoculated with 50 µl of the freshly prepared inoculum. The cultures were incubated at 37ºC in a shaker at 100 rpm. An aliquot of culture 
was taken out in an oven sterilized tube, at regular 
intervals of 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 21 and 24 h. Absorbance was measured at 600 nm. Growth was plotted graphically.

 Decolourizati on of azo dy es by  
strains has been reported by  many rese archer s 
(Khalid et al ., 2008; Hon g et al ., 200 7; Xu et al ., 
2007). Bacterial degradation of azo d yes is generally 
considered a specific react ion by azoreductase under aerobic conditions or a nonspecific reduction 
process under anaerobic conditions. Maier et al.  
(2004)  report ed that a the rmoalkalophilic Bacillus 
sp. was able to reduce a large structural variety  of 
azo d yes. David and  Steven (1994) reported that 
azo-dy es are also degraded efficiently  under aerobic 
conditions by wood rotti ng fungi which are in nature 
responsible for the degradation of lig nin. In the  
present study cell free extract of Corynebacterium  
sp. illustrated degradation of Reactive Black5 and 
Reactive Yellow15 68% and 80%, respectively .

and Dave (2009) also confirmed the degradation of Reactive Red BS on TLC and no spot was observed 
in visible light whereas spots with different R

activity against Reactive Black5 (68%) and Reactive 
Yellow15 (80%).  Corynebacterium  sp. also showed 
excellent ability to decolourize azo dyes i.e., 60% 
(Reactive Black5) and 76% (Reactive Yellow) in 
the presence of 100 µg dyes/ml. The bacterial 
isolate can be exploited for bioremediation of azo 
dyes containing wastes, since it seems to have the potential to degrade the toxic reactive dyes into non-toxic product form. Knowledge of biodegradation is important for the evaluati on of the persistence of 
organic pollutants and the design of biodegradation facilities. Therefore, further detailed research is needed to quantify these substrates interactions in the degradation of dyes and its derivatives.
