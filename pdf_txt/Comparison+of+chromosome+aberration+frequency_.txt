§799.9538 TSCA mammalian bone mar-
row chromosomal aberration test.
(a) Scope. This section is intended to
meet the testing requirements under
section 4 of TSCA. The mammalian
bone marrow chromosomal aberration
test is used for the detection of struc-
tural chromosome aberrations induced
by test compounds in bone marrow
VerDate 25<JUN>98 09:27 Jul 24, 1998 Jkt 179163 PO 00000 Frm 00314 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\SGML\179163T.XXX pfrm07 PsN: 179163T319Environmental Protection Agency §799.9538
cells of animals, usually rodents.
Structural chromosome aberrations
may be of two types, chromosome or
chromatid. An increase in polyploidy
may indicate that a chemical has the
potential to induce numerical aberra-
tions. With the majority of chemical
mutagens, induced aberrations are of
the chromatid-type, but chromosome-
type aberrations also occur. Chro-
mosome mutations and related events
are the cause of many human genetic
diseases and there is substantial evi-
dence that chromosome mutations and
related events causing alterations in
oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes
are involved in cancer in humans and
experimental systems.
(b) Source. The source material used
in developing this TSCA test guideline
is the OECD guideline 475 (February
1997). This source is available at the ad-
dress in paragraph (g) of this section.
(c) Definitions. The following defini-
tions apply to this section:
Chromatid-type aberration is struc-
tural chromosome damage expressed as
breakage of single chromatids or
breakage and reunion between
chromatids.
Chromosome-type aberration is struc-
tural chromosome damage expressed as
breakage, or breakage and reunion, of
both chromatids at an identical site.
Endoreduplication is a process in
which after an S period of DNA replica-
tion, the nucleus does not go into mito-
sis but starts another S period. The re-
sult is chromosomes with
2,4,8,...chromatids.
Gap is an achromatic lesion smaller
than the width of one chromatid, and
with minimum misalignment of the
chromatids.
Numerical aberration is a change in
the number of chromosomes from the
normal number characteristic of the
animals utilized.
Polyploidy is a multiple of the
haploid chromosome number (n) other
than the diploid number (i.e., 3n, 4n
and so on).
Structural aberration is a change in
chromosome structure detectable by
microscopic examination of the meta-
phase stage of cell division, observed as
deletions and fragments, intrachanges
or interchanges.(d) Initial considerations. (1) Rodents
are routinely used in this test. Bone
marrow is the target tissue in this test,
since it is a highly vascularised tissue,
and it contains a population of rapidly
cycling cells that can be readily iso-
lated and processed. Other species and
target tissues are not the subject of
this section.
(2) This chromosome aberration test
is especially relevant to assessing mu-
tagenic hazard in that it allows consid-
eration of factors of in vivo metabo-
lism, pharmacokinetics and DNA-re-
pair processes although these may vary
among species and among tissues. An
in vivo test is also useful for further in-
vestigation of a mutagenic effect de-
tected by an in vitro test.
(3) If there is evidence that the test
substance, or a reactive metabolite,
will not reach the target tissue, it is
not appropriate to use this test.
(e) Test method Ð(1) Principle. Animals
are exposed to the test substance by an
appropriate route of exposure and are
sacrificed at appropriate times after
treatment. Prior to sacrifice, animals
are treated with a metaphase-arresting
agent (e.g., colchicine or Colcemid).
Chromosome preparations are then
made from the bone marrow cells and
stained, and metaphase cells are ana-
lyzed for chromosome aberrations.
(2) Description Ð(i) Preparations Ð(A)
Selection of animal species. Rats, mice
and Chinese hamsters are commonly
used, although any appropriate mam-
malian species may be used. Commonly
used laboratory strains of young
healthy adult animals should be em-
ployed. At the commencement of the
study, the weight variation of animals
should be minimal and not exceed ±
20% of the mean weight of each sex.
(B) Housing and feeding conditions.
The temperature in the experimental
animal room should be 22 °C ± 3 °C). Al-
though the relative humidity should be
at least 30% and preferably not exceed
70% other than during room cleaning,
the aim should be 50±60%. Lighting
should be artificial, the sequence being
12 hrs light, 12 hrs dark. For feeding,
conventional laboratory diets may be
used with an unlimited supply of drink-
ing water. The choice of diet may be
influenced by the need to ensure a suit-
able admixture of a test substance
VerDate 25<JUN>98 09:27 Jul 24, 1998 Jkt 179163 PO 00000 Frm 00315 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\SGML\179163T.XXX pfrm07 PsN: 179163T32040 CFR Ch. I (7±1±98 Edition) §799.9538
when administered by this method.
Animals may be housed individually,
or be caged in small groups of the same
sex.
(C) Preparation of the animals.
Healthy young adult animals shall be
randomly assigned to the control and
treatment groups. Cages should be ar-
ranged in such a way that possible ef-
fects due to cage placement are mini-
mized. The animals are identified
uniquely. The animals are acclimated
to the laboratory conditions for at
least 5 days.
(D) Preparation of doses. Solid test
substances shall be dissolved or sus-
pended in appropriate solvents or vehi-
cles and diluted, as appropriate, prior
to dosing of the animals. Liquid test
substances may be dosed directly or di-
luted prior to dosing. Fresh prepara-
tions of the test substance should be
employed unless stability data dem-
onstrate the acceptability of storage.
(ii) Test conditions Ð(A) Solvent/vehicle.
The solvent/vehicle shall not produce
toxic effects at the dose levels used,
and shall not be suspected of chemical
reaction with the test substance. If
other than well-known solvents/vehi-
cles are used, their inclusion should be
supported with data indicating their
compatibility. It is recommended that
wherever possible, the use of an aque-
ous solvent/vehicle should be consid-
ered first.
(B) Controls. (1) Concurrent positive
and negative (solvent/vehicle) controls
shall be included for each sex in each
test. Except for treatment with the
test substance, animals in the control
groups should be handled in an iden-
tical manner to the animals in the
treated groups.
(2) Positive controls shall produce
structural chromosome aberrations in
vivo at exposure levels expected to give
a detectable increase over background.
Positive control doses should be chosen
so that the effects are clear but do not
immediately reveal the identity of the
coded slides to the reader. It is accept-
able that the positive control be ad-
ministered by a route different from
the test substance and sampled at only
a single time. The use of chemical class
related positive control chemicals may
be considered, when available. Exam-ples of positive control substances in-
clude:
Chemical CAS No.
Triethylenemelamine .......................... [CAS no. 51±18±3]
Ethyl methanesulphonate .................. [CAS no. 62±50±0]
Ethyl nitrosourea ................................ [CAS no. 759±73±9]
Mitomycin C ....................................... [CAS no. 50±07±7]
Cyclophosphamide (monohydrate) ....[CAS no. 50±18±0]
[CAS no. 6055±19±2]
(3) Negative controls, treated with
solvent or vehicle alone, and otherwise
treated in the same way as the treat-
ment groups, shall be included for
every sampling time, unless acceptable
inter-animal variability and fre-
quencies of cells with chromosome ab-
errations are available from historical
control data. If single sampling is ap-
plied for negative controls, the most
appropriate time is the first sampling
time. In the absence of historical or
published control data demonstrating
that no deleterious or mutagenic ef-
fects are induced by the chosen solvent/
vehicle, untreated controls shall be
used .
(3) Procedure Ð(i) Number and sex of
animals. Each treated and control
group shall include at least 5 analyz-
able animals per sex. If at the time of
the study there are data available from
studies in the same species and using
the same route of exposure that dem-
onstrate that there are no substantial
differences in toxicity between sexes,
then testing in a single sex will be suf-
ficient. Where human exposure to
chemicals may be sex-specific, as for
example with some pharmaceutical
agents, the test should be performed
with animals of the appropriate sex.
(ii) Treatment schedule. (A) Test sub-
stances are preferably administered as
a single treatment. Test substances
may also be administered as a split
dose, i.e. two treatments on the same
day separated by no more than a few
hrs, to facilitate administering a large
volume of material. Other dose regi-
mens should be scientifically justified.
(B) Samples shall be taken at two
separate times following treatment on
one day. For rodents, the first sam-
pling interval is 1.5 normal cell cycle
length (the latter being normally 12±18
hr) following treatment. Since the
time required for uptake and metabo-
lism of the test substance as well as its
VerDate 25<JUN>98 09:27 Jul 24, 1998 Jkt 179163 PO 00000 Frm 00316 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\SGML\179163T.XXX pfrm07 PsN: 179163T321Environmental Protection Agency §799.9538
effect on cell cycle kinetics can affect
the optimum time for chromosome ab-
erration detection, a later sample col-
lection 24 hr after the first sample time
is recommended. If dose regimens of
more than one day are used, one sam-
pling time at 1.5 normal cell cycle
lengths after the final treatment
should be used.
(C) Prior to sacrifice, animals shall
be injected intraperitoneally with an
appropriate dose of a metaphase arrest-
ing agent (e.g. Colcemidor col-
chicine). Animals are sampled at an ap-
propriate interval thereafter. For mice
this interval is approximately 3±5 hrs;
for Chinese hamsters this interval is
approximately 4±5 hrs. Cells shall be
harvested from the bone marrow and
analyzed from chromosome aberra-
tions.
(iii) Dose levels. If a range finding
study is performed because there are
no suitable data available, it shall be
performed in the same laboratory,
using the same species, strain, sex, and
treatment regimen to be used in the
main study (an approach to dose selec-
tion is presented in the reference under
paragraph (g)(5) of this section). If
there is toxicity, three dose levels shall
be used for the first sampling time.
These dose levels shall cover a range
from the maximum to little or no tox-
icity. At the later sampling time only
the highest dose needs to be used. The
highest dose is defined as the dose pro-
ducing signs of toxicity such that high-
er dose levels, based on the same dos-
ing regimen, would be expected to
produce lethality. Substances with spe-
cific biological activities at low non-
toxic doses (such as hormones and
mitogens) may be exceptions to the
dose-setting criteria and should be
evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The
highest dose may also be defined as a
dose that produces some indication of
toxicity in the bone marrow (e.g. great-
er than 50% reduction in mitotic
index).
(iv) Limit test. If a test at one dose
level of at least 2,000 mg/kg body
weight using a single treatment, or as
two treatments on the same day, pro-
duces no observable toxic effects, and if
genotoxicity would not be expected
based on data from structurally related
compounds, then a full study usingthree dose levels may not be considered
necessary. For studies of a longer dura-
tion, the limit dose is 2,000 mg/kg/body
weight/day for treatment up to 14 days,
and 1,000 mg/kg/body weight/day for
treatment longer than 14 days. Ex-
pected human exposure may indicate
the need for a higher dose level to be
used in the limit test.
(v) Administration of doses. The test
substance is usually administered by
gavage using a stomach tube or a suit-
able intubation cannula, or by
intraperitoneal injection. Other routes
of exposure may be acceptable where
they can be justified. The maximum
volume of liquid that can be adminis-
tered by gavage or injection at one
time depends on the size of the test
animal. The volume should not exceed
2 ml/100g body weight. The use of vol-
umes higher than these must be justi-
fied. Except for irritating or corrosive
substances which will normally reveal
exacerbated effects with higher con-
centrations, variability in test volume
should be minimized by adjusting the
concentration to ensure a constant vol-
ume at all dose levels.
(vi) Chromosome preparation. Imme-
diately after sacrifice, bone marrow
shall be obtained, exposed to hypotonic
solution and fixed. The cells shall be
then spread on slides and stained.
(vii) Analysis. (A) The mitotic index
should be determined as a measure of
cytotoxicity in at least 1,000 cells per
animal for all treated animals (includ-
ing positive controls) and untreated
negative control animals.
(B) At least 100 cells should be ana-
lyzed for each animal. This number
could be reduced when high numbers of
aberrations are observed. All slides, in-
cluding those of positive and negative
controls, shall be independently coded
before microscopic analysis. Since slide
preparation procedures often result in
the breakage of a proportion of meta-
phases with loss of chromosomes, the
cells scored should therefore contain a
number of centromeres equal to the
number 2n ± 2.
(f) Data and reporting Ð(1) Treatment
of results. Individual animal data shall
be presented in tabular form. The ex-
perimental unit is the animal. For each
animal the number of cells scored, the
number of aberrations per cell and the
VerDate 25<JUN>98 09:27 Jul 24, 1998 Jkt 179163 PO 00000 Frm 00317 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\SGML\179163T.XXX pfrm07 PsN: 179163T32240 CFR Ch. I (7±1±98 Edition) §799.9538
percentage of cells with structural
chromosome aberration(s) shall be
evaluated. Different types of structural
chromosome aberrations shall be listed
with their numbers and frequencies for
treated and control groups. Gaps shall
be recorded separately and reported
but generally not included in the total
aberration frequency. If there is no evi-
dence for a difference in response be-
tween the sexes, the data may be com-
bined for statistical analysis.
(2) Evaluation and interpretation of re-
sults. (i) There are several criteria for
determining a positive result, such as a
dose-related increase in the relative
number of cells with chromosome aber-
rations or a clear increase in the num-
ber of cells with aberrations in a single
dose group at a single sampling time.
Biological relevance of the results
should be considered first. Statistical
methods may be used as an aid in eval-
uating the test results (some statis-
tical methods are described in the ref-
erence under paragraph (g)(6) of this
section). Statistical significance
should not be the only determining fac-
tor for a positive response. Equivocal
results should be clarified by further
testing preferably using a modification
of experimental conditions.
(ii) An increase in polyploidy may in-
dicate that the test substance has the
potential to induce numerical chro-
mosome aberrations. An increase in
endoreduplication may indicate that
the test substance has the potential to
inhibit cell cycle progression. This phe-
nomenon is described in the references
under paragraphs (g)(7) and (g)(8) of
this section.
(iii) A test substance for which the
results do not meet the criteria de-
scribed in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this sec-
tion is considered non-mutagenic in
this test.
(iv) Although most experiments will
give clearly positive or negative re-
sults, in rare cases the data set will
preclude making a definite judgment
about the activity of the test sub-
stance. Results may remain equivocal
or questionable regardless of the num-
ber of experiments performed.
(v) Positive results from the in vivo
chromosome aberration test indicate
that a substance induces chromosome
aberrations in the bone marrow of thespecies tested. Negative results indi-
cate that, under the test conditions,
the test substance does not induce
chromosome aberrations in the bone
marrow of the species tested.
(vi) The likelihood that the test sub-
stance or its metabolites reach the
general circulation or specifically the
target tissue (e.g., systemic toxicity)
should be discussed.
(3) Test report. The test report shall
include the following information:
(i) Test substance:

(1) The mammalian erythrocyte
micronucleus test is used for the detec-
