1. Introduction
Environmental, long-term economic and national
security concerns have motivated research over the last
25 years into renewable, domestic sources of fuels and
chemicals now mostly derived from petroleum. Cur-rently practiced technologies in US industry are basedonthefermentationofglucosederivedfromcornstarch.The US fuel ethanol industry represents an on-goingsuccess story for the production of renewable fuels.According to the Renewable Fuels Association (2003),
the US annual fuel ethanol capacity was 2.9 ·10
9US
gallons in 2002, an increase of 109US gallons over the
production level in 2000. This industry forms an infra-
structure from which future growth in cellulosic sub-
strates utilization may occur. Demand for fuel ethanolis expected to increase. In addition to ethanol, fortychemicals and chemical feedstocks have been identiﬁedas potential products from renewable plant biomass(Ladisch et al., 1979 ;Voloch et al., 1985 ;Landucci
et al., 1996;Ladisch, 2002 ).

cellulosic biomass to make cellulose more accessible to
the enzymes that convert the carbohydrate polymersinto fermentable sugars as represented in the schematicdiagram of Fig. 1. The goal is to break the lignin seal
and disrupt the crystalline structure of cellulose. Pre-

1994;Kohlmanet al., 1995 ;Mosier et al., 2003a,b ).
2. Ethanol processoverview
Processing of lignocellulosics to ethanol consists of
four major unit operations: pretreatment, hydrolysis,fermentation, and product separation/puriﬁcation. Pre-treatment is required to alter the biomass macroscopic
and microscopic size and structure as well as its sub-
microscopicchemicalcompositionandstructuresothathydrolysis of the carbohydrate fraction to monomericsugars can be achieved more rapidly and with greateryields.Hydrolysisincludestheprocessingstepsthatcon-vertthecarbohydratepolymersintomonomericsugars.Although avariety of process conﬁgurationshavebeenstudied for conversion of cellulosic biomass into etha-

Cellulosecanbehydrolyticallybrokendownintoglu-
cose either enzymatically by cellulases or chemically bysulfuric or other acids. Hemicellulases or acids hydro-lyzethehemicellulosepolymertoreleaseitscomponent
sugars. Glucose, galactose, and mannose, six carbon
sugars (hexoses), are readily fermented to ethanol bymany naturally occurring organisms, but the pentosesxylose and arabinose (containing only ﬁve carbonatoms) are fermented to ethanol by few native strains,and usually at relatively low yields. While pentoses are
not readily fermented, the ketose of xylose, xylulose, isconvertedtoethanolby S. pombe,S. cerevisiae ,S. amu-
cae,andKluveromyces lactis (Gong, 1983 ). Xylose and
arabinose generally comprise a signiﬁcant fraction ofhardwoods, agricultural residues, and grasses ( Table 1)
andmustbeutilizedtomaketheeconomicsofbiomassprocessingfeasible( Lyndetal.,1999 ).Geneticmodiﬁca-
tion of bacteria ( Ingram et al., 1998, 1999 ) and yeast
(Ho et al., 1998, 1999 ) has produced strains capable of
co-fermenting both pentoses and hexoses to ethanolandother value-added products at high yields.
Enzymatic hydrolysis performed separately from the
fermentation step is known as separate hydrolysis andfermentation (SHF). Cellulose hydrolysis carried outinthepresenceofthefermentativemicroorganismisre-
ferredtoassimultaneoussacchariﬁcationandfermenta-
tion (SSF). Simultaneous sacchariﬁcation of bothcellulose (to glucose) and hemicellulose (to xylose andarabinose)andco-fermentationofbothglucoseandxy-lose (SSCF) would be carried out by genetically engi-neered microbes that ferment xylose and glucose in thesame broth as the enzymatic hydrolysis of celluloseand hemicellulose. SSF and SSCF are preferred since
both unit operations can be done in the same tank,
resulting in lower costs ( Wright et al., 1988 ).

processing step, pretreatment, and how this processingstep aﬀects downstream processing performance.

corn stover, wood chips, and ‘‘energy crops’’ currently
underdevelopment( Lynd et al., 1999 ).
3. Inﬂuenceof biomass composition andstructure
on cellulose hydrolysis
Unlessaverylargeexcessofenzymeisused,theenzy-
matic digestibility of the cellulose in native biomass is
low (<20% yield) because of its structural characteris-tics.Cellulosicbiomass,sometimescalledlignocellulosicbiomass, is a heterogeneous complex of carbohydratepolymers and lignin, a complex polymer of phenylpro-panoid units ( Wright et al., 1988 ). Lignocellulosic bio-
mass typically contains 55–75% carbohydrates by dryweight (Table 1). Cellulose, like starch, is a polymer of
glucose. However, unlike starch, the speciﬁc structure
of cellulose favors the ordering of the polymer chainsinto tightly packed, highly crystalline structures thatare water insoluble and resistant to depolymerization.The other carbohydrate component in lignocellulosicsis hemicellulose, which, dependent on the species, is abranchedpolymerofglucoseorxylose,substitutedwitharabinose, xylose, galactose, fucose, mannose, glucose,
orglucuronicacid.Someofthesidechainsmayalsocon-
tain acetyl groups of ferulate ( Carpita and Gibeaut,
1993). Hemicellulose hydrogen-bonds to cellulose
microﬁbrils, thus forming a network that provides thestructural backbone to plant cell wall. The presence oflignin in some cell walls imparts further strength, andprovides resistance againstpestsanddiseases. Celluloseand hemicellulose are potential sources of fermentable
sugars(Hinmanetal.,1989 ;Hoetal.,1998 ;Taherzadeh
etal.,1999;SreenathandJeﬀries,2000 ).Thepresenceof
lignin in the cell wall, however, impedes enzymatichydrolysis of the carbohydrates.
The crystallinity of cellulose, accessible surface area,
protectionofcellulosebylignin,theheterogeneouschar-acter of biomass particles, and cellulose sheathing byhemicellulose all contribute to the recalcitrance of lign-
ocellulosicbiomasstohydrolysis( Rydholm,1965 ;Wen-
zel, 1970;Hsu et al., 1980 ;Hsu, 1996;Chang and
Holtzapple,2000 ).However,crystallinityaloneisinsuf-
ﬁcient to prevent signiﬁcant hydrolysis if suﬃcient en-zyme is used. For example, hydrolysis of Avicel, amicrocrystalline cellulose, proceeded to 80% hydrolysisin 6 days when incubated with 72 units of GenencorCytolase (CL) cellulase per gram ( Ladisch et al., 1992 ).
Therelationshipsbetweenstructuralandcompositional
factors reﬂect the complexity of lignocellulosic materi-als. The variability in these characteristics accounts for
the varying digestibility between diﬀerent sources oflignocellulosic biomass. In principle, an eﬀective pre-
treatment causes disruption of these barriers so that
hydrolytic enzymes can penetrate and cause hydrolysisasillustratedschematicallyin Fig.1andalsominimizes
degradationbyavoidingsugardegradationasillustratedin the sequence of Fig. 2(Ladisch et al., 1983 ;Lynd
et al., 1991;Holtzapple, 1993 ;Mosier et al., 1999 ).
4. Goals of pretreatment
An eﬀective pretreatment is characterized by several
criteria. It avoids the need for reducing the size of bio-mass particles, preserves the pentose (hemicellulose)fractions,limitsformationofdegradationproductsthatinhibit growth of fermentative microorganism, mini-mizes energy demands and limits cost ( National Re-
search Council, 1999 ). These properties, along with
others includinglowpretreatment catalyst costorinex-pensive catalyst recycle, and generation of higher-valuelignin co-product form a basis of comparison for vari-ous pretreatment options. Pretreatment results must bebalanced against their impact on the cost of the down-streamprocessingstepsandthetrade-oﬀbetweenoper-atingcosts,capitalcosts,andbiomasscosts( Lyndetal.,
1996;Wyman,1995b,1996,1999 ;Delgenesetal.,1996 ;
Palmqvist and Hahn-Hagerdal, 2000 ;Ladisch et al.,
1983). The process itself utilizes pretreatment additives

nologies that have promise for cost eﬀective pretreat-ment of cellulosic biomass for biological conversion to
fuels andchemicals.
5. Pretreatment processeconomic analysis
Rigorous process economic analysis is necessary to
determine the best pretreatment process options for a
Fig. 2. Schematic representation of pretreatment steps. Transforma-
tion between crystalline (C) amorphous cellulose (C*) is reversible.
Both forms may yield oligosaccharides, which in turn form glucose.
Glucose degradation can then occur to form fermentation inhibitors(fromWeil,1992).N. Mosier et al. / Bioresource Technology 96 (2005) 673–686 675particular feedstock and product opportunity, once the

treated solids or the relative toxicity to fermentative
microorganisms represent important metrics. Processeconomicanalysisalsoenableestimationofanabsoluteproductioncost forethanolorother potential productsnecessaryforcomparingbioreﬁnery-basedcoststoexist-ing processes. The combination of experimental dataand economic modeling also results in a matrix thatmatches feedstocks with conversion options, as well as

6. Pretreatment categories
Pretreatmentmethodsareeitherphysicalorchemical.
Some methods incorporate both eﬀects ( McMillan,1994;Hsu, 1996). For the purposes of classiﬁcation,
steam and water are excluded from being considered
chemicalagentsforpretreatmentsinceextraneouschem-
icals are not added to the biomass. Physical pretreat-ment methods include comminution (mechanicalreduction in biomass particulate size), steam explosion,and hydrothermolysis. Comminution, including dry,wet,andvibratoryballmilling( Millettetal.,1979 ;Riv-
ers and Emert, 1987 ;Sidiras and Koukios, 1989 ), and
compression milling ( Tassinari et al., 1980, 1982 )i s
sometimes needed to make material handling easier
through subsequent processing steps. Acids or basesthat promote hydrolysis and improve the yield of glu-cose recovery from cellulose by removing hemicelluloseorligninduringpretreatment.Themostcommonlyusedacid and base are H
2SO4and NaOH, respectively.
Cellulosesolventsareanothertypeofchemicaladdi-
tive. Solvents that dissolve cellulose in bagasse, corn-
stalks, tall fescue, and orchard grass resulted in 90%
conversion of cellulose to glucose ( Ladisch et al., 1978 ;
Hamilton et al., 1984 ) and showed enzyme hydrolysis
could be greatly enhanced when the biomass structureis disrupted before hydrolysis. Alkaline H
2O2, ozone,
organosolv (uses Lewis acids, FeCl 3, (Al)2SO4in aque-
ousalcohols),glycerol,dioxane,phenol,orethylenegly-col are among solvents known to disrupt cellulose
structure and promote hydrolysis ( Wood and Saddler,
1988). Concentrated mineral acids (H
2SO4, HCl),
ammonia-based solvents (NH 3, hydrazine), aprotic sol-
vents(DMSO),metalcomplexes(ferricsodiumtartrate,cadoxen, and cuoxan), and wet oxidation also reducescellulose crystallinity and disrupt the association of lig-nin with cellulose, as well as dissolve hemicellulose.These methods, while eﬀective, are too expensive to be
practicalwhenmeasuredagainstthevalueoftheglucose
(approximately5¢/lb).
Thepretreatmentmethodsoutlinedin Table1:steam
explosion,liquidhotwater,diluteacid,lime,andammo-nia pretreatments, have potential as cost-eﬀective pre-treatments and are discussed in this review. Keyfeatures that diﬀerentiate approaches are outlined withthe discussion following the summary in Table 2.

Uncatalyzedsteamexplosionisappliedcommercially
to hydrolyze hemicellulose for manufacture of ﬁber-board and other products by the Masonite process(Mason, 1926 ;DeLong, 1981 ). Wood chips are con-
veyed into large vessels, and high-pressure steam is ap-plied for a few minutes without addition of chemicals.
At a set time, some steam is rapidly vented from the
reactortoreducethepressure,andthecontentsaredis-charged into a large vessel to ﬂash cool the biomass.
7.1. Process description
Extensive research has been conducted on steam
explosion, (see reviews of Saddler et al., 1993 ;Hsu,
1996;McMillan,1994 ).Uncatalyzedsteamexplosionre-
ferstoapretreatmenttechniqueinwhichlignocellulosicbiomass is rapidly heated by high-pressure steam with-outadditionofanychemicals. The biomass/steam mix-ture is held for a period of time to promotehemicellulose hydrolysis, and terminated by an explo-sive decompression ( Brownell and Saddler, 1984 ;Avel-
lar and Glasser, 1998 ;Glasser and Wright, 1998 ;Heitz
et al., 1991 ;Abatzoglou et al., 1992 ;Ramos et al.,
1992). Hemicellulose is thought to be hydrolyzed by
the acetic and other acids released during steam explo-sion pretreatment. Steam explosion involves chemicaleﬀects and a reaction sequence of the type shown inFig. 2since acetic acid is generated from hydrolysis of
acetylgroupsassociatedwiththehemicellulosemayfur-ther catalyze hydrolysis and glucose or xylose degrada-
tion. Water, itself, also acts as an acid at high
temperatures( Weil et al., 1997 ;Baugh et al., 1988a,b ).
Steamprovidesaneﬀectivevehicletorapidlyheatcel-
lulosicstothetargettemperaturewithoutexcessivedilu-tion of the resulting sugars. Rapid pressure releaserapidlyreduces the temperatureandquenches the reac-tion at the end of the pretreatment. The rapid thermalexpansion used to terminate the reaction opens up theparticulate structure of the biomass but enhancement
of digestibility of the cellulose in the pretreated solid isonlyweaklycorrelatedwiththisphysicaleﬀect( Brown-
ell et al., 1986 ;Biermannet al., 1984 ).

ocellulosicbiomassbysteamexplosionareoftenattrib-
utedtotheremovalofhemicellulose.Thisimprovestheaccessibility of the enzymes to the cellulose ﬁbrils.Reduction in biomass particle size and increased porevolume after explosive decompression is less importantin improving the digestibility of steam exploded ligno-cellulosic biomass.
8. Liquid hot water pretreatments
Water pretreatments use pressure to maintain the
waterintheliquidstateatelevatedtemperatures( Bobl-
eter,1994;Bobleteretal.,1976,1981 ;BobleterandCon-
cin, 1979;Hormeyer et al., 1988a,b ;Walch et al., 1992 ;
Mok and Antal, 1992 ;Kohlman et al., 1995 ;Allen
et al., 1996 ;van Walsum et al., 1996 ). Flow-through
processes pass water maintained in the liquid state atelevated temperatures through cellulosics. This type ofpretreatment has been termed hydrothermolysis ( Bobl-
eter et al., 1981 ;Bobleter and Concin, 1979 ), aqueous
or steam/aqueous fractionation ( Bouchard et al.,
1991), uncatalyzed solvolysis ( Mok and Antal, 1992,
1994), andaquasolv ( Allen et al., 1996 ).
Solvolysis by hot compressed liquid water contacts
water with biomass for up to 15 min at temperaturesof 200–230 /C176C. Between 40% and 60% of the total
biomass is dissolved in the process, with 4–22% of thecellulose,35–60%oftheligninandallofthehemicellu-lose being removed. Over 90% of the hemicellulose isrecovered as monomeric sugars when acid was used tohydrolyze the resulting liquid. The pretreatment resultsTable2

1992, 1994).

Co-current liquid hot water pretreatment is being

et al., 1998b ,Beery et al., 2000 ;Mosier et al.,
2003a,b). Biomass liquid slurry of approximately 16%
undissolved solids passes through heat exchangers, isheated to the desired temperature (140–180 /C176C), (heat

In countercurrent pretreatment the biomassslurry is passed in one direction while water is passed

Size reduction of the incoming biomass is not needed
since the lignocellulose particles break apart whencooked in water ( Kohlman et al., 1995 ;Weil et al.,
1997).Ahighlydigestiblecelluloseresultswhenenzyme

1996;van Walsum et al., 1996 ;Mosier et al., 2003a,b ).
8.2. Mode of action
Itislikelythatstructuralandchemicalchangesoccur
tothelignininthenonﬂow-throughmethods.However,the lack of eﬀective analytical methods for evaluatinglignin structureandchemicalcompositionhashindereddeveloping an understanding this phenomenon.
Liquid hot water pretreatments are both helped and
hindered by the cleavage of O-acetyl and uronic acid
substitutions from hemicellulose to generate acetic and
other organic acids. The release of these acids helps to
catalyze formation and removal of oligosaccharides.However, the polysaccharides and especially hemicellu-lose, may be further hydrolyzed to monomeric sugarswhich are subsequently partially degraded to aldehydesif acid is used. These aldehydes, principally furfuralfrom pentoses and 5-hydroxymethyl furfural from hex-ose,areinhibitorytomicrobialfermentation( Palmqvist
and Hahn-Hagerdal, 2000 ).

(1994),Hsu (1996),Jacobsen and Wyman (1999) , and
Lee et al. (1999) . Dilute sulfuric acid has been added
to cellulosic materials for some years to commercially
manufacture furfural ( Root et al., 1959 ;Zeitsch, 2000 ).Dilute sulfuric acid is mixed with biomass tohydrolyze
hemicellulose to xylose and other sugars and then con-tinuetobreakxylosedowntoformfurfural.Thefurfu-ral is recovered by distillation. The volatile fractioncontainsthefurfuralwhichispuriﬁedandsold.Theacidismixedorcontactedwiththebiomass,andthemixture

ity of cellulose in the residual solids ( Knappert et al.,
1981;BrownellandSaddler,1984 ;ConverseandGreth-
lein,1985;Grousetal.,1985 ).Themostwidelyusedand
tested approaches are based on dilute sulfuric acid(Grohmann et al., 1985 ;Torget et al., 1992 ;Nguyen
et al., 2000 ;Kim et al., 2000 ). However, nitric acid
(Brink, 1993, 1994 ), hydrochloric acid ( Israilides et al.,
1978;Goldstein et al., 1983 ;Goldstein and Easter,
1992),andphosphoricacid ( Israilides etal.,1978 )have
also been tested.

Dilute sulfuric acid has some important limitations
including corrosion that mandates expensive materials
of construction. The acid must be neutralized before
the sugars proceed to fermentation. Gypsum has prob-lematic reverse solubility characteristics when neutral-ized with inexpensive calcium hydroxide. Formation ofdegradationproductsandreleaseofnaturalbiomassfer-mentation inhibitors are other characteristics of acidpretreatment. Disposal of neutralization salts ( Hinman
etal.,1992;Wooleyetal.,1999 ;USDepartmentofEn-
ergy, 1993;Hsu, 1996;McMillan, 1994 ;Grohmann
et al., 1985, 1986 ;Torget et al., 1991 ;Forsberg et al.,
1986;Mes-Hartree and Saddler, 1983 ), as well as a 7-
day reaction time with cellulase loadings of up to 20IFPU/gram cellulose translate into added cost ( Wright
et al., 1987 ;Hinman et al., 1992 ;US Department of
Energy,1993 ;Wooleyetal.,1999 ).Grindingofthecel-
lulose to 1 mm accounts for 33% of the power require-
ments of the entire process ( Hinman et al., 1992 ;
US Department of Energy, 1993 ;Wooley et al., 1999 ).N. Mosier et al. / Bioresource Technology 96 (2005) 673–686 679Nitricacidreducescontainmentcostsrelativetosulfuric

ancesthis beneﬁt.
Useofacidtoremovehemicellulosehasbeentriedon
a wide range of feedstocks ranging from hardwoods tograsses and agricultural residues ( Knappert et al.,
1981;Converse and Grethlein, 1985 ;Grous et al.,
1985;Lee et al., 1978 ;Grohmann et al., 1985 ;Torget
et al., 1990, 1991, 1992 ). Most species performed well,
andcorn cobsandstoverwerefoundtobeparticularlywell suited to pretreatment by hemicellulose hydrolysis(Torget et al., 1991 ). Pretreatment of aspen wood and
wheatstrawwerestudiedathighersolidsconcentrationsof20–40%intesttubesheatedinanaluminumblockfor
temperatures of 140 and 160 /C176C(Grohmann et al.,
1986). Sulfuric acid levels of 0.45–0.85% were used for
aspen to reduce the pH to about 1.1–1.5, but up to2.0%acidwasneededtocompensatefortheneutralizingabilityofwheatstraw.Theuseofacidtohydrolyzeolig-omers released during uncatalyzed hydrolysis results inclose to complete hydrolysis to monosaccharides butalso the formation of aldehydes ( Garrote et al., 2001 ;
Shevchenko et al., 2000 ).
9.2. Mode of action
Acid hydrolysis releases oligomers and monosaccha-
ridesandhashistoricallybeenmodeledasahomogene-ous reaction in which acid catalyzes breakdown ofcellulose to glucose followed by breakdown of the glu-
cose released to form HMF and other degradation
products (Saeman, 1945 ). This reﬂects the approxi-
matelyequalreactivityofglycosidicbondsinthesepol-ymers with respect to hydrolysis. Various researchersadapted Saeman /C213s kinetics to describe the hydrolysis
of hemicellulose and formation of furfural and otherdecomposition products ( Kwarteng, 1983 ;Kim and
Lee, 1987;Ladisch, 1989 ;Converse et al., 1989 ;Est-
eghlalian et al., 1997 ;Lee et al., 1999 ;Mosier et al.,
2002).
Oligomersaregenerallyignoredinmanymodelssince
theyareviewedasbeingtooshort-livedtobeimportant(Ranganathanetal.,1985 ;Bhandarietal.,1984 ;Malo-
neyetal.,1985 ).Othershaveshownoligomerstobepre-
sent in batch hydrolysis systems ( Kim and Lee, 1987 )
and to be a signiﬁcant fraction of the product for very
dilute acid and water only ﬂow-through systems ( Bobl-
eter et al., 1981 ;Mok and Antal, 1992 ;Bobleter, 1994 ;
Allen et al., 1996 ;Torget et al., 1996 ). Kinetic models
have been modiﬁed to include hemicellulose hydrolysisto oligomers followed by their breakdown to sugarswhere the sugars degrade to furfural and other com-pounds for batch, percolation, and ﬂow-through diluteacid-catalyzed systems ( Chen et al., 1996 ). Modeling of
hemicellulosehydrolysisasabiphasicreactionincorpo-
ratesfastandslowhydrolyzingsolidhemicellulosefrac-tions (Kobayashi and Sakai, 1956 ;Grohmann et al.,
1985;Maloney et al., 1985 ;Chen et al., 1996 ).
Improvementshavealsobeenrealizedbyaddingaddi-
tionalacidtocompensateforthecapacityofmineralsinthe substrate to neutralize some of the acid ( Kwarteng,
1983;Esteghlalianetal.,1997 ;Cahelaetal.,1983 ;Con-
neretal.,1986 )andbycalculatingthehydrogenioncon-
centration from the pH ( Malester et al., 1992 ). The
inﬂuence of pH on rate has been factored into kineticmodels to predict that the sugar yields will be highestinapHrangeof2.0–2.5( Baughetal.,1988a,b ).

Despiteachievingexcellenthemicellulosesugaryields
and highly digestible cellulose with low acid loadings,equipment conﬁgurations and the high ratio of waterto solids employed in ﬂow-through systems require sig-niﬁcant energy for pretreatment and product recovery.
Practical systems that lend themselves to commercial
applications havenot been demonstrated.
11. Lime pretreatment
Alkali pretreatment processes utilize lower tempera-
tures and pressures compared to other pretreatment
technologies. Alkali pretreatment may be carried out
at ambient conditions, but pretreatment time is meas-680 N. Mosier et al. / Bioresource Technology 96 (2005) 673–686ured in terms of hours or days rather than minutes or
seconds. Unlike acid-catalyzed pretreatments, a limita-tion occurs because some of the alkali is converted toirrecoverablesaltsorincorporatedassaltsintothebio-massbythepretreatmentreactions.Limehasbeenusedto pretreat wheat straw (85 /C176C for 3 h, Chang et al.,
1998),poplarwood(150 /C176Cfor6hwith14-atmoxygen,
Changetal.,2001 ),switchgrass(100 /C176Cfor2h,Chang
etal.,1997),andcornstover(100 /C176Cfor13h,Karrand
Holtzapple, 1998, 2000 ).
Playne(1984) treatedsugarcanebagassewithlimeat
ambient conditions for up to 192 h to improve theenzyme digestibility of the cellulose from 20% beforepretreatmentto72%afterpretreatment.Highertemper-
atures and shorter reactions times were also shown
to eﬀectively pretreat lignocellulose with lime. Chang
etal.(1998) ,obtainedsimilardigestibilityresultsbypre-
treatingbagassewithlimeat120 /C176Cfor1h.Otheralkali
pretreatments use sodium, potassium, calcium, andammonium hydroxide as reactants. Sodium hydroxidehas received the most attention ( Sharmas et al., 2002 ;
Soto et al., 1994 ;Fox et al., 1989 ;MacDonald et al.,
1983).Lime(calciumhydroxide)hastheadditionalben-
eﬁts of low reagent cost and safety ( Chang et al., 1997 ;
Playne,1984 )andbeingrecoverablefromwaterasinsol-
ublecalciumcarbonatebyreactionwithcarbondioxide.The carbonate can then be converted to lime usingestablished lime kiln technology ( Chang et al., 1998 ).
The addition of air/oxygen to the reaction mixture
greatlyimprovesthedeligniﬁcationofthebiomass,espe-
cially highly ligniﬁed materials such as poplar ( Chang
and Holtzapple, 2000 ). Oxidative lime pretreatment of
poplar (Chang et al., 2001 ) at 150 /C176C for 6 h removed
77.5% of the lignin from the wood chips and improvedthe yield of glucose from enzymatic hydrolysis from7% (untreated) to 77% (treated) compared to the un-treated and pretreated poplarwood.
11.1. Process description
The process of lime pretreatment involves slurrying
thelimewithwater,sprayingitontothebiomassmate-rial, and storing the material in a pile for a period ofhourstoweeks.Theparticlesizeofthebiomassistypi-cally 10 mm or less. Elevated temperatures reduce con-tact time (i.e., 3 h at 85 /C176C for wheat straw and 13 h
at 100 /C176C for corn stover).

accessibilityoftheenzymetothehemicelluloseandcellu-losesurface( ChangandHoltzapple,2000 ).
For lesser ligniniﬁed materials such as corn stover,
the addition of oxygen appears to only marginally im-prove the digestibility of pretreated corn stover with
lime at a 1:0.075 ratio (stover:lime) at 120 /C176C for times
upto6h,(KarrandHoltzapple,1998 ).Cornstoverpre-
treatedfortheoptimaltime(4h)at120 /C176Closes32%of
thelignin.Hydrolysisyielded88%ofthecelluloseasglu-cose after 7 days at an enzyme loading of 25 FPU pergram ofbiomass.
12. Ammonia pretreatment
Ammonia ﬁber/freeze explosion (AFEX) pretreat-
mentyieldsoptimalhydrolysisratesforpretreatedlign-ocellulosics with close to theoretical yields at lowenzyme loadings (<5 FPU per gram of biomass or 20FPU/g cellulose) ( Dale, 1986;Dale and Moreira, 1982 ;
Holtzappleetal.,1991 ;Daleetal.,1996 ;Moniruzzaman
etal.,1997;Fosteretal.,2001 ).Herbaceousandagricul-
tural residues are well suited for AFEX. However, thismethod works only moderately well on hardwoods,andis not attractivefor softwoods ( McMillan, 1994 ).
12.1. Process description
Pretreatment with aqueous ammonia in a ﬂow-
through mode involves putting ammonia solution (5–
15%) through a column reactor packed with biomassatelevatedtemperatures(160–180 /C176C)andaﬂuidveloc-
ityof1mL/cm

methodisalsoknownasammoniarecycledpercolation(ARP)processsinceammoniaisseparatedandrecycled.Undertheseconditions,aqueousammoniareactsprima-rilywithlignin(butnotcellulose)andcausesdepolymer-
ization of lignin and cleavage of lignin-carbohydrate
linkages.Alargeandadjustabledegreeofdeligniﬁcationhas been reported in tests with hardwood ( Yoon et al.,
1995) and agricultural residues ( Iyer et al., 1996 )a t
160–180 /C176Cwithresidencetimesat14min.Itwassome-
what less eﬃcient in pretreatment of softwood-basedpulp mill sludge ( Kim et al., 2000 ).

fractionation of biomass ( Kim and Lee, 1996 ;Kim et
al.,2002).Sinceligninisoneofthekeyfactorsaﬀecting

Theammoniafreezeexplosionpretreatmentsimulta-
neouslyreduceslignincontentandremovessomehemi-cellulose while decrystallizing cellulose. Thus it aﬀectsboth micro-and macro-accessibility of the cellulases to
the cellulose. Liquid ammonia causes cellulose swelling
and a phase change in the crystal structure from cellu-lose I to cellulose III. It is believed that ammonlolysisof glucuronic cross-links make the carbohydrate moreaccessible (Lin et al., 1981 ).
The cost of ammonia and especially of ammonia
recoverydrivesthecostofthispretreatment( Holtzapple
etal.,1992).However,biomasspretreatmenteconomics
are also strongly inﬂuenced by total sugar yields
achieved, and by the loss in yield and inhibition ofdownstream processes caused by sugar degradationproducts. The moderate temperatures (<90 /C176C) and
pHvalues(<12.0)oftheAFEXtreatmentminimizefor-mationofsugardegradationproductswhilegivinghighyields.
13. Conclusions
Cellulosecrystallinity,accessiblesurfacearea,protec-
tion by lignin, and cellulose sheathing by hemicelluloseall contribute to its resistance of biomass to enzymatichydrolysis. The various pretreatment technologies re-viewedaboveaﬀectatleasttwoofthesechemical/phys-
ical factors ( Table 1). The development of advanced
pretreatment technologies that control mechanisms,are tuned to unique characteristics of diﬀerent types ofbiomassandminimizecostarestillneeded.Theultimategoal is the eﬃcient fractionation of lignocellulose intomultiple streams that contain value-added compoundsin concentrations that make puriﬁcation, utilization,and/or recovery economically feasible.
