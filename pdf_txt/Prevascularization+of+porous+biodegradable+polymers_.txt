Abstract Tissue engineering seeks strategies to design
polymeric scaffolds that allow high-cell-density cultures
with signaling molecules and suitable vascular supply. Onemajor obstacle in tissue engineering is the inability to
create thick engineered-tissue constructs. A pre-vascular-
ized tissue scaffold appears to be the most favorableapproach to avoid nutrient and oxygen supply limitations
as well as to allow waste removal, factors that are often
hurdles in developing thick engineered tissues. Vasculari-zation can be achieved using strategies in which cells are
cultured in bioactive polymer scaffolds that can mimic
extracellular matrix environments. This review addressesrecent advances and future challenges in developing and
using bioactive polymer scaffolds to promote tissue con-
struct vascularization.

Introduction
The development of a functional vascular network within an
engineered human tissue construct constitutes a promisinghope in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine [ 1].
Although there have been some successes in tissue-engi-
neering approaches, these have been limited to thin andavascular tissues (e.g., cartilage, skin and bladder) [ 2].
However, the development of thick tissues (i.e., pancreas,
liver, heart, and kidneys) is problematic because of the lackof construct vascularization, resulting in cell and tissue death
[1,3]. The focus of current research efforts in tissue engi-
neering has mainly been on developing strategies to promotemicrovascularization within tissue constructs [ 3,4].
One possible strategy for creating thick engineered-tis-
sue substitutes in vitro is to use a bioactive polymer scaf-fold that allows the development of microvessel formation
in order to provide a vascularized tissue construct [ 5]. The
idea of pre-vascularizing engineering tissue substitutes wasinitiated by Mikos [ 6] when comparing the performance of
pre-vascularized tissues to non-vascularized ones in vitro.
The pre-vascularization strategy was also developed toimprove the performance of skeletal muscle tissue con-
structs in vivo [ 7].
Further advances in tissue engineering have also brought
signiﬁcant knowledge about the mechanisms and parame-
ters related to the development of vascularization andangiogenesis [ 7,8]. The tissue engineering scientiﬁc soci-
ety relies on the increasing knowledge about vasculo- and
angiogenesis within the polymer scaffolds. This reviewwill report the current status and developments related to
bioactive polymer scaffolds and strategies to promote
vascular networks inside engineered thick tissue constructs.

on the transplantation waiting list in 2002, and only 24,422
received organs; 6,297 died while waiting [ 8]. In addition,
although organ transplantation is one of the less expensivetherapies in regenerative medicine, tissue engineering
offers hope for more consistent and rapid treatment of
those in need [ 1,8,9].
As an interdisciplinary approach between engineering
and life science, tissue engineering seeks the opportunity to
develop suitable biomaterial-cell hybrid constructs to sup-
port the regeneration and restoration of tissue structure and
function. Facing the critical challenges in tissue engineer-ing today relies on our knowledge and ability to fabricate
tissue and organ replacements that can carry out physio-
logical functions [ 10]. Also, the success of tissue-engi-
neering methods relies on the ability of the construct to
integrate with the native tissue at the implantation site.
Tissue engineering is facing important clinical and prac-tical problems, such as cell sourcing, rejection, healing, and
cell/tissue death [ 11,12].
Various key concepts in tissue engineering and regen-
erative medicine have been pursued to overcome those
problems; these concepts include injection of tissue-spe-
ciﬁc viable cells directly into damaged tissue (for example,brain cells in the case of Parkinson’s or Alzheimer’s dis-
ease), encapsulation of speciﬁc cell types within synthetic
permeable matrices that allow release of therapeutics (e.g.,the release of insulin or dopamine from pancreatic islets in
the treatment of diabetes), and seeding scaffolds with living
cells in vitro, allowing their maturation before beingimplanted [ 9,13]. This article is mainly interested in the
last concept.
If an isolated cell population can be expanded in vitro
using cell culture and bioreactor techniques, in theory, only
a very small number of cells from donors would be nec-
essary to prepare such biological implants. Since the iso-lated cells cannot form new tissue by themselves, a
(temporary) template is needed, which we refer to here as a
scaffold. Scaffolds are expected to provide control overtissue architecture and mechanical properties. They can
allow cells to adhere, proliferate, and migrate [ 14,15]i n
order to form a required structure and to synthesize theirown extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules [ 15,16], thus
hopefully allowing tissue regeneration or repair.
It is believed that successfully developing tissue con-
structs depends on many factors, such as cell sourcing, the
type of biomaterials used to make scaffolds, and tissue
culture methods, to name only a few. For example, the useof cells from other species, such as pigs, remains in debate
because of the risk of transferring diseases from animals to
humans [ 17]. Using cells from the same genotype or close
relatives of a patient could avoid problems associated with
immune rejection, which can result in tissue death [ 18].The behavior of individual cells and the dynamic state
of multicellular tissues are regulated by the interaction
between cells and their surrounding matrix. Therefore, the
design of scaffolds from the macroscopic scale (e.g., porestructure) to the nanoscopic level (e.g., surface properties)
is very important. Firstly, the decision to use either natural
or synthetic scaffolds should be based on their ability toprovide a speciﬁc microenvironment that mimics the nat-
ural environment of the targeted anatomical site [ 19].
Secondly, the three-dimensional scaffold should fulﬁll
some requirements with respect to: biocompatibility, deg-
radation rate, porosity, mechanical properties (e.g., stiff-ness), and chemistry (e.g., surface chemical/protein
composition) [ 20].
In the in vivo environment, cells interact with their ECM
in a dynamic manner. The concept of dynamic ‘‘commu-
nication’’ between cells and their matrix has opened wide
exploration of the ECM molecules and scaffold materialsthat can be used in tissue engineering. Scaffolds can be
made from synthetic polymers, naturally occurring mate-
rials, or a combination of both.
Synthetic polymers
Synthetic polymers have been investigated and used to make
scaffolds in tissue engineering for a variety of possible
applications. The principal advantage of using syntheticpolymers is that their properties (e.g., biodegradation,
physicochemistry, and mechanical stiffness) can be con-
trolled by manipulating their molecular weight and compo-sitions, for example [ 20
]. Among them, synthetic degradable
polymers from the poly( a-esters) family, such as poly(lactic
acid) (PLA), poly(glycolic acid) (PGA), and their co-poly-mers, have been extensively investigated in biomaterials and
tissue engineering [ 20,21].
Synthetic polymers from the poly( a-esters) group are
degraded mainly through chemical hydrolysis and are
mostly insensitive to enzymatic attack [ 21]; often, the
degradation proﬁle does not vary between patients [ 22].
For example, it was recognized that the constituting
monomers of PLA and PGA are nontoxic and metabolized
in the body [ 23]. Therefore, PLA, PGA, and their
copolymers [e.g., poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)]
are FDA-approved, and they can be produced to form a
variety of implants ranging from screws, meshes, andsutures to porous scaffolds [ 23,24].
PGA is an inelastic polyester with a high crystallinity
(46–50 %) and is degraded by water (through hydrolysis)to form glycolic acid [ 25]. PLA is less crystalline, more
hydrophobic, and less susceptible to hydrolysis than PGA
[24]. For tissue-engineering applications, the copolymers,
such as PLLA [poly(
L-lactic acid)], PLGA [poly(lactic-co-
glycolic acid)], and PDLLA [poly( D,L-lactic acid)] are216 J Artif Organs (2012) 15:215–224
123more popular, since their properties can be tailored [ 26].
For example, the degradation time of PLLA has been
reported to be very slow, while PDLLA hydrolyzed in a
matter of weeks [ 24,26]. Even a small amount of D,L-LA in
the polymer chain of PLA can accelerate the degradation
time dramatically [ 26,27].
Several investigators have explored the potential use of
polymers from the PLA and PGA family to fabricate
scaffolds for the promotion of microvascularization and
angiogenesis. For example, Grizzi et al. [ 28] have produced
poly( D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) scaffolds to engineer
tubular tissues. Furthermore, when endothelial cells wereseeded in these constructs, they were able to generate a
capillary network inside the scaffold. Also, in a more
recent study, Levenberg et al. [ 29] successfully pre-vas-
cularized PLLA/PLGA sponges with pore size ranging
from 225 to 500 lm. Then, when they implanted the pre-
vascularized scaffold in skeletal muscles of mice, theyfound that the method could promote angiogenesis in the
implant.
In another application,
D,L-lactic acid (DLLA) was
combined with 1,3-trimethylene carbonate (TMC) at a
speciﬁc molecular weight ratio of 81:19 (DLLA:TMC) in
order to produce a TMC-DLLA copolymer [ 30]. This
copolymer was processed to make a scaffold with 100- lm
average pore size having high interconnectivity. This
scaffold was tested in vitro to support cardiomyocytes.Further subcutaneously implanted study in rats showed it
elicited an acute inﬂammatory reaction [ 31].
Natural polymers
Compared to synthetic polymers, natural polymers have
longer histories and have been broadly used in many
applications in the biomedical, pharmaceutical, and tis-
sue-engineering ﬁelds. While synthetic scaffolds offergood mechanical properties and less product variability
with a high level of control, natural scaffolds provide a
better environment for cell attachment and signalling,resulting in more efﬁcient regulation of cell structures
and functions [ 32]. Natural polymers can be made from
proteins (e.g., collagens, gelatin, albumin, and ﬁbrino-gen), polysaccharides (e.g., chitosan, hyaluronic acid,
alginate, cellulose and dextran), and their chemical
derivatives.
Extracellular matrix-derived polymers are attractive
materials for making bioactive scaffolds, since they can
provide cells with an environment more similar to the cellnative ECM [ 18,21]. The ECM can be deﬁned as a com-
plex protein structure outside the cells, which mainly
consists of collagens and proteoglycans. The primaryfunction of the ECM is to support the cellular structure.
Some ECM components regulate cellular processes, suchas cell proliferation, motility, differentiation, migration,
and adhesion [ 32].
Each tissue has a unique ECM composition and envi-
ronment. Therefore, the design of the ECM-derived scaf-fold should mimic certain features and functions of the
ECM for the targeted end use. For example, in the case of
scaffold vascularization, the matrix should provide anenvironment such as in the connective tissue for the
endothelial cells to adhere and proliferate as well as to
form and remodel vascular structures [ 32,33]. Further-
more, as endothelial cells line the innermost layer of blood
vessels and capillary microvessels, their interaction withthe underlying ECM is essential to maintain cellular
integrity and functional activity for the development of
functional and mature blood vessels [ 33]. To date, natural
polymers such as hyaluronic acid, chitosan, alginate, col-
lagens, and ﬁbrin are the most important biodegradable
materials for fabricating scaffolds.
Hyaluronic acid (HA), also known as hyaluronan, is a
glycosaminoglycan (GAG) that has a linear polysaccharide
branch (glucuronic acid N-acetyl
D-glucosamine). Hyalu-
ronic acid is the embryo’s ﬁrst ECM material and is present
in nearly all adult mammalian tissues [ 34]. Hyaluronic
acid, with high molecular mass (ranging between 10 to1,000 kDa), has unique characteristics [ 35]. Indeed, HA
shows poor cell adherence and inhibits endothelial cell
proliferation, while its degradation products (e.g., oligo-saccharides of HA, o-HA) are pro-angiogenic and, through
chemotaxis, can stimulate cell migration, differentiation,
and the overall angiogenesis process [ 35,36]. For example,
Toole [ 35] demonstrated that o-HA (molecular mass
\10 kDa) induced angiogenesis with human umbilical
endothelial cells (HUVEC) in the chorioallantoic mem-brane (CAM) assay. Furthermore, the CD44 receptors in
endothelial cells were found to bind o-HA and to initiate
the expression of early response genes (ERG), resulting incell proliferation and migration [ 37]. More recently, o-HA
was reported to stimulate angiogenesis, either in vitro or in
vivo, with vascular endothelial cells through both CD44and RHAMM (receptors for HA-mediated motility) [ 38,
39]. In addition, added ﬁbroblast growth factor (FGF) in
the HA matrix improved the neovascularization of theconstruct [ 40].
Other polysaccharides, such as chitosan and alginate,
have also been investigated for various tissue engineeringand biomedical applications. Chitosan is a linear polysac-
charide, composed of N-acetyl and
D-glucosamine, and has
been investigated for some applications, such as makingcontact lenses [ 41], matrices for encapsulate cells [ 42],
drug-release devices, and engineering cartilage and bone
substitutes [ 40]. Chitosan is now an attractive biomaterial
for fabricating scaffolds [ 41,42]. For example, some
research groups have produced a scaffold made of chitosanJ Artif Organs (2012) 15:215–224 217
123cross-linked with HA [ 39,41–43]. This scaffold improved
endothelial cell proliferation, and induced capillary net-
work and angiogenesis development inside the construct
[39,43].
Alginate gel is a hydrogel that is not affected by tem-
perature changes [ 44]. It has been tested for drug delivery
and cell transplantation [ 45]. Furthermore, incorporating
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in alginate gels
promoted neovascularization in the matrix [ 45,46]. This
system has been suggested as a promising approach for
clinical applications [ 46].
Collagens are the most abundant proteins, being found
in nearly all tissues in mammals [ 47]. Type I, II, III, and IV
are the most abundant forms and make up approximately
90 % of the collagens in the human body [ 47,48]. To date,
over 25 types of collagens have been identiﬁed and have
been processed into various forms, including ﬁlms, spon-
ges, ﬁbers, and gels [ 48]. Collagen type I, II, III, V and XI
can self-assemble into ﬁbrils. Other collagens (e.g., type
IV, VIII, and X) form networks and are found in the
basement membrane.
In tissue engineering, to increase the mechanical
strength and to avoid rapid degradation of collagens, often
physical or chemical cross-linking is used [ 49]. Photo-
oxidation, de-hydrothermal treatment, and ultraviolet irra-
diation are examples of physical cross-linking methods,
while chemical methods include treatment with carbodii-mides, glutaraldehydes, and poly(glycidyl ether) [ 50].
Often, chemical methods result in a higher degree of cross-
linking; they are therefore more common than physicalmethods. Also, chemical treatment parameters (e.g., time
and temperature) as well as catalyst concentration can be
adapted to vary mechanical and degradation properties ofcollagen scaffolds [ 51]. On the other hand, chemical
methods could leave some potentially toxic chemical res-
idues [ 50].
Collagens can be puriﬁed from animal and human
sources, but concern about immunological and disease
transmissions, especially for animal collagens, stillremains. To avoid these risks, Toman et al. [ 51] have
suggested a method to produce recombinant collagens.
Recombinant human collagen types I and II are commer-cially available now (e.g., FibroGen Inc., San Francisco,
CA, USA). An engineered tissue substitute for skin
replacement called Apligraft
TM(Organogenesis Inc., Can-
ton, MA, USA) is made from collagen type I and was the
ﬁrst commercialized man-made tissue substitute. Collagen
can also be extracted from tilapia ( Oreochromis niloticus ).
Indeed, Sugiura et al. [ 52] have produced collagen sponge
from tilapia. In vivo implantation of the scaffold into rabbit
muscle revealed that tilapia collagen caused fewerinﬂammatory responses when compared to porcine colla-
gen [ 52].Other studies have reported the use of type I and IV
collagens to carry out angiogenesis and vasculogenesis
assays [ 53]. In vitro culture of endothelial cells in a 3D
matrix made of type I collagen resulted in an increasednumber of tube-like structures and supported angiogenesis
development [ 54]. Also, with FGF, a collagen type IV
scaffold supported endothelial cell growth and differenti-ation, thus regulating capillary development [ 54,55]. Xu
et al. [ 56] concluded that denaturation of collagen type IV
can promote a speciﬁc angiogenic cryptic epitope (i.e.,
HUIV26), which can bind to the cellular integrin avb3. To
date, at least four different collagen-binding integrins onendothelial cells are known, including a1b1,a2b1,a10b1,
anda11b1[56,57].
Human ﬁbrinogen is a large, complex, and ﬁbrous gly-
coprotein with a molecular weight of 340 kDa. It is 45 nm
long and composed of two symmetric ‘‘D’’ domain mole-
cules and a central ‘‘E’’ domain. Each domain consists ofone set of three different polypeptide chains termed the A a,
Bb, andcchain [ 58]. In the body, ﬁbrinogen is present in
human blood plasma at a concentration of approximately2.5 g/l. The protein is essential for hemostasis, wound
healing, inﬂammation, angiogenesis, and other biological
events. Fibrinogen is a soluble macromolecule that can beconverted to an insoluble gel (i.e., ﬁbrin) to stabilize the
hemostatic plug and to provide a temporary matrix for
subsequent cellular responses involved in wound healing[58,59]. The role of ﬁbrin in this process is not passive, but
the protein rather actively directs cellular responses
through speciﬁc receptor-mediated interactions with bloodcells (e.g., leucocytes) as well as endothelial cells of the
vessel wall [ 60]. Therefore, the use of ﬁbrin as a bioactive
scaffold to support tissue vascularization is of interest.
The formation of ﬁbrin clots during wound healing is
initiated by the release of thrombin, a serine protease
enzyme, which subsequently activates the coagulation cas-cade [ 58,60]. After the release, thrombin cleaves peptide
fragments from ﬁbrinogen to generate the ﬁbrin monomer by
the clotting cascade into protoﬁbrils. Afterward, in thepresence of the chloride ion and transglutaminase factor XIII
or factor XIIIa, protoﬁbrils undergo intermolecular cross-
linking to form a stable ﬁbrin gel [ 60,61
].
Changing the ﬁbrinogen or thrombin concentration can
change the resulting ﬁbrin material, affecting both bio-
chemical and mechanical properties [ 62]. For example,
Vailhe ´et al. [ 63] have shown that capillary-like structures
made from HUVEC seeded on ﬁbrin depended on the
mechanical factor of the gel. Harder gel, made using ahigher concentration of ﬁbrinogen, led to a decreased
number of capillary-like structures. No capillary-like
structures were found in a softer matrix ( \0.5 mg/ml of
ﬁbrinogen) or in a too rigid one ( [4 mg/ml of ﬁbrinogen)
[63].218 J Artif Organs (2012) 15:215–224
123Increasing ﬁbrinogen concentration can also reduce the
matrix pore size, thus hindering endothelial cell migration
and capillary formation [ 64]. In addition, Rowe et al. [ 61]
found that decreasing thrombin concentration resulted inboth an increased gel compaction and micro-ﬁber size, thus
causing a different cellular morphology and alignment of
vascular smooth muscle cells. These examples illustratethat ﬁbrin gel properties and subsequent cell responses can
be modulated to some extent, opening the door to more
applications [ 64,65].
To date, ﬁbrin is commercially available as ﬁbrin sealant
or ﬁbrin glue (e.g., Tisseel
TM, Baxter AG, Vienna, Austria)
for surgical applications [ 65]. Also, ﬁbrin scaffolds have
been used in many tissue-engineering applications,
including as a matrix to treat bone and skin defects [ 66], for
drug delivery in neurological and cardiovascular disorders
[66,67], and for three-dimensional angiogenesis assays
[63,68,69]. Fibrinogen has induced adhesion, spreading,
and microﬁlament organization of human endothelial cells
in 2D and 3D in vitro culture systems [ 68,69].
Also, culturing endothelial cells on microcarrier beads
and then embedding these beads in ﬁbrin have been
proposed by Nehls and Drenckhahn [ 70]. This system
resulted in the formation of capillary structures andsprouting [ 70]. However, the system failed to model
sprouting angiogenesis containing a multi-cellular lumen
surrounded by polarized endothelial cells, which isimportant during blood microvessel development [ 71–73].
More recent vascularization studies using ﬁbrin gels have
been presented by [ 74] and [ 75]. In another study [ 76],
endothelial cells proliferated and migrated along pat-
terned polymer ﬁbers. In longer culture time, ﬁbrin was
degraded along with the formation of cell-cell interac-tions, leading to the formation of tube-like structures, and
eventually to sprouting and lumen formation with adja-
cent vessels [ 77].
Unlike synthetic hydrogels, ﬁbrin is an active matrix for
cells. It can bind many growth factors and bioactive clothcomponents including ﬁbronectin, hyaluronic acid, and von
Willebrand factor [ 60]. Human ﬁbrinogen can bind to
endothelial cells through either integrin or non-integrin
binding sites (Table 1). For example, ﬁbrin has two pairs of
RGD binding sites and a non-RGD site at the cchain,
which can interact with endothelial cell integrins (i.e.,
a5b1,avb3, and a
IIbb3) as well as with leucocyte integrins
(i.e.,aMb3 and aXb2) [65,77,78]. Other non-integrin
receptors that can bind to endothelial cells include ICAM-
1, CD-44 surface receptor, and platelet endothelial cell
adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1, also known as CD-31)
[60,79–81].
In other tissue-engineering applications, ﬁbrin was
combined with collagen for the development of blood
vessel substitutes [ 82,83]. Collagen type I is the predom-
inant structural component of the media as well as the
adventia layers of blood vessels, while the inner layer of
natural blood vessels, called the intimal layer, is lined with
endothelial cells [ 27,81]. Therefore, the combination of
collagen and ﬁbrin can be used to make scaffolds with
good mechanical and biochemical properties [ 82]. For
example, Isenberg et al. [ 83] have investigated a tubular
scaffold made of type I collagen and ﬁbrinogen to engineer
small-diameter artiﬁcial arteries.
A summary of the uses of synthetic and natural poly-
mers that have been applied to support tissue vasculariza-
tion is presented in Table 2.
Material properties
Scaffold and ECM materials are selected based on bulk and
surface properties, which can be tuned with the aim tomodulate cell adhesion and proliferation as well as phe-
notypic cell expression [ 54,84]. Among the properties of
importance, scaffold porosity and matrix stiffness playsigniﬁcant roles in cell and tissue responses [ 85,86], and
these will be brieﬂy discussed below.

123Scaffold porosity
Porosity is deﬁned as the fraction of the void space over the
total volume of a scaffold. Pore size corresponds to the
distance between two solid sections of the porous matrix[87,88]. In tissue engineering, a highly porous scaffold
(about 90 % porosity) is more desirable, since it should
increase mass and nutrient transport [ 88]. Higher porosity
can increase cell adhesion and provide a sufﬁcient area for
cell-matrix interactions and new ECM production by cells
[89]. However, bulk and mechanical properties should also
be considered. At higher porosity, the total solid volume of
the solid part of the scaffold is lower when compared to
scaffolds with lower porosity, thus resulting in weakermechanical support [ 88,89].
The effect of pore size on cell behavior has been
investigated in culturing bone tissue substitutes. Pores inthe range of 300–400 lm have been found to be optimal
for osteoblast attachment, growth, and proliferation [ 90].
The important role of such porous structures in endothelialcell organization and angiogenesis development was pio-
neered by Clowes et al. [ 91] more than 20 years ago. In a
more recent study, pore size was found to have a signiﬁcanteffect on cell binding, morphology, and phenotype, thus
inducing endothelial cell migration and capillary formation
inside the scaffold [ 92,93].
In the scientiﬁc literature, there are some suggestions
concerning the optimum pore size to support vasculariza-
tion. For example, many mature cell types, includingﬁbroblasts and endothelial cells, have been found to be
unable to spread and completely colonize the bulk of
scaffolds with pore sizes higher than 300 lm because of
the difﬁculty in bridging the distance [ 93]. In an in vitro
angiogenesis study, it was shown that cell’s ability to
bridge the distance in 3D scaffolds is important for sup-porting the vascularization process [ 76]. Using HUVEC-
covered poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) monoﬁlaments
as contact guidance in HUVEC-seeded ﬁbrin, it was sug-gested that the optimum ﬁber-ﬁber distance to support
microvessel development was 100 lm[76,77].
Furthermore, hepatocytes were also reported to spread
well on a gelatin-chitosan scaffold (3:1) with a pore size of
20lm, while ﬁbroblasts and endothelial cells spread better
on the same matrix but with pores ranging between100–150 lm compared to pores from 20–80 lm[93,94].
The role of pore size to promote the endothelial cell lining
has been investigated in vascular grafts. For example, Zhanget al. [ 95] found that an external pore size of 30 lm was
preferable compared to 20 lm or smaller pores in terms of
promoting rapid tissue ingrowth and endothelial cell growth
in the expanded poly(tetraﬂuoroethylene) (ePTFE) graft.
In addition, Marshall et al. [ 96] found that ﬁbrin
with 35 lm pores signiﬁcantly supported angiogenesisdevelopment when compared to ﬁbrin with either 20 or
70lm pores. Fibrin with pore sizes of approximately
30
lm promotes the ingrowth of vascularized ﬁbrous tissue
in engineered blood vessels [ 97]. However, the optimum
porosity and pore size of the scaffold are still open to
question and are based on the application as well as the cell
type [ 88,93,95].
Matrix stiffnessSubstrate mechanical properties, such as stiffness, are
known to be important parameters affecting cell responses.In cell biology, matrix stiffness is sensed by cell receptors,
and integrins transmit mechanical stress across the cell
surface to the cell cytoskeleton, converting mechanicalsignals into biochemical ones [ 47,55,98].
Therefore, the ECM stiffness will inﬂuence cellular
functions, including cell adhesion, proliferation, migration,and phenotype differentiation [ 99]. For example, Pelham
and Wang [ 100] examined the effect of a collagen-coated
poly(acrylamide) scaffold on the behavior of rat epithelialand ﬁbroblast cells. They found that on more rigid (higher
stiffness) surfaces, cells were more spread, and showed
increased motility and focal adhesion contacts [ 99,100].
Furthermore, increasing surface stiffness was found to
result in increased cell contractility [ 101], more organized
cells cytoskeleton and actin stress ﬁbers, and higheradhesion strength [ 102]. The phenomenon related to the
effect of environmental stiffness on cell behavior is known
to as durotaxis [ 103].
Substrate stiffness and cell contractility also play sig-
niﬁcant roles in microvascular development. For example,
while endothelial cells proliferate more on rigid surfaces,they form tube-like structures on softer substrates [ 102,
104]. Vasculogenesis decreased with an increase in matrix
stiffness, which was a result of an increase in collagen [ 48,
51,105] or ﬁbrinogen [ 63,65,106,107] concentrations.
Concluding remarks
Signiﬁcant advances in tissue-engineering research have
provided the possibility for the commercial availability of
simple engineered tissue substitutes such as skin, bone, and
cartilage. However, for more complex and thicker tissueconstructs, many problems still remain. Consequently, the
development of bioactive polymer scaffolds for engineer-
ing tissues as well as strategies to enhance vascularizationinside the constructs has become important. Scaffold vas-
cularisation improves the oxygen and nutrient transfer as
well as waste removal. This strategy is necessary to allowthe production of thicker tissue substitutes as well as arti-
ﬁcial organs.J Artif Organs (2012) 15:215–224 221
