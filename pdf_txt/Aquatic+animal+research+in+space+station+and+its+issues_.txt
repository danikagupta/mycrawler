Freshwater nitrate contamination is a growing
international concern. Although the drinkingwater standard is 10 mg/L nitrate–nitrogen(NO
3–N) in the United States and 11.3 mg/L
NO 3–N in Europe (European Council 1998;
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 1996),natural water bodies can exceed 100 mg/Lnitrate [reviewed by Rouse et al. (1999)]. InIowa a statewide well-water survey reportedthat 18% of rural drinking water wells werecontaminated with nitrate concentrations thatexceeded 10 mg/L NO
3–N (Kross et al. 1993).
Nitrate usually enters surface and ground
water in runoff from point and nonpointsources, including ﬁelds, golf courses, privategardens, livestock feedlots, and sewage treat-ment facilities (Berndt et al. 1998; Katz et al.1999). Under normal circumstances, aquaticnitrogen is naturally cycled by bacterial andplant communities. However, if these organ-isms are limited (e.g., low light, low phospho-rus) and unable to remediate excess nitrateconcentrations, nitrate can accumulate.Elevated aquatic nitrate potentially affectsreproduction and survival of exposed animalsby directly influencing their physiology[reviewed by Guillette and Edwards (2005)].
Aquatic animals are exposed to nitrate pri-
marily through ingestion or epithelial absorp-tion across gills or skin (Onken et al. 2003). Incrabs, nitrate can cross the gills, sometimesagainst a concentration gradient, by substitut-ing for chloride (Cl) in the chloride-bicarbon-ate exchange mechanism that normallyregulates the osmotic and respiratory functionsof the gill (Lee and Pritchard 1985; Onkenet al. 2003). The ability of the gill epithelium
of freshwater ﬁsh to accumulate Cl
–suggests
that nitrate can also accumulate, as shown intiger prawns (Cheng and Chen 2002). Thus,as is the case with chloride, the circulatingnitrate concentration can exceed that of thesurrounding water.
Evidence suggests that sensitivity to nitrate
is species-specific. Kincheloe et al. (1979)reported larval mortality of Chinook salmon,rainbow trout, and cutthroat trout at concen-trations as low as 2.3–7.6 mg/L NO
3–N. The
96-hr LC 50(median lethal concentration) for
fathead minnow larvae is 1,341 mg/LNO
3–N (Scott and Crunkilton 2000), and
the lethal dose for adult and juvenile medakais 100 mg/L NO
3–N (Shimura et al. 2002).
A range of sublethal effects of nitrate has
also been reported. For example, Greenleeet al. (2004) observed increased apoptosis andreduced cell number in cultured preimplanta-tion mouse embryos exposed to 1 mg/Lammonium nitrate. In an accumulated nitratetest, in which nitrate built up over the coursethe experiment, Shimura et al. (2002) observeddelayed hatching time and reduced fertilizationand hatching rates of eggs produced by adultmedaka exposed for 2 months to a maximumof 75 mg/L NO
3–N. In that test, the offspring
also exhibited reduced juvenile growth rates.At 50 mg/L NO
3–N, Shimura et al. (2002)
observed reduced spawning and fecundity(measured as egg number) among adultmedaka exposed to nitrate as juveniles.
In mammals, nitrate can be converted by
reversible reactions in vivo to nitrite and thennitric oxide (NO) (Kozlov et al. 1999; Lepore
2000; Panesar and Chan 2000; Samouilovet al. 1998; Weitzberg and Lundberg 1998).Several authors have suggested that nitrateinﬂuences vertebrate reproduction by affectingsteroid hormone balance or NO regulation(DelPunta 1996; Panesar and Chan 2000;Vanvoorhis et al. 1994). For example, themammalian ovarian cycle and ovulation areregulated, in part, by interactions amonggonadotropins, progesterone, estradiol, andNO (Al-Hijji et al. 2001; Rupnow et al. 2001;Vanvoorhis et al. 1994; Yamagata et al. 2002).Essentially, NO appears to reduce steroid hor-mone synthesis by inhibiting several steroido-genic enzymes or other major factors in thesteroidogenic pathway. These include steroido-genic acute regulatory protein (StAR), and theenzymes P450-sidechain cleavage (P450
SCC),
3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 βHSD),
and aromatase (DelPunta et al. 1996; Panesarand Chan 2000; Stocco DM and Guillette LJ,unpublished data; Vanvoorhis et al. 1994;Weitzberg and Lundberg 1998; Yamagataet al. 2002).
Given the observed and hypothesized
effects of nitrate on vertebrate reproduction andgrowth, we investigated the relationshipsbetween low concentrations of nitrate and sev-eral reproductive variables in wild female mos-quitoﬁsh captured from eight Florida springs.The range of nitrate concentrations in the sam-pled springs (0.2–5.1 mg/L NO
3–N) is repre-
sentative of most Florida springs (Katz et al.1999). We also considered the potential inﬂu-ence of four other environmental parameters:temperature, pH, conductivity, and dissolvedoxygen. In addition to this primary objective,

Contamination of freshwater ecosystems with nitrate is a growing global concern. Although
nitrate pollution is recognized as a cause of aquatic eutrophication, few studies have examined thepossible physiological impacts of nitrate exposure. In this study, we surveyed several reproductivevariables of viviparous female Gambusia holbrooki (Poeciliidae) captured from eight springs in
Florida. The eight springs represent a gradient of nitrate contamination (1–5 mg/L nitrate–nitro-gen). We had two objectives in this study: to describe reproductive biology of female mosquitoﬁshin the springs and to understand reproductive variation in the context of water quality, particu-larly the nitrate concentration. Our data show a signiﬁcant negative association between nitrateand both dry weight of developing embryos and rate of reproductive activity among maturefemales. In addition, variation in Gambusia condition index and embryo number and dry weight
was related to temperature variation, and hepatic weight was negatively related to dissolved oxy-gen concentration. Finally, we observed that many of the measured reproductive variables wereinterrelated and changeable, depending on gestational stage. Speciﬁcally, we provide evidence thatmaternal support of the embryo occurs at least during the first two thirds of gestation and thatfemale fecundity is affected by an apparent tradeoff between embryo size and embryo number.Key words: endocrine disruption, fish, Gambusia , growth, larvae, matrotrophy, mosquitofish,

(2006). doi:10.1289/ehp.8056 available via http://dx.doi.org/ [Online 21 October 2005]the second purpose of this study was to describe
the reproductive biology of female Gambusia
holbrooki from the sampled populations.
Methods
Field collections and water quality. Between
21 May and 7 June 2003, adult femaleG. holbrooki (eastern mosquitoﬁsh) were col-
lected using 3-mm mesh dip nets or seinesfrom eight Florida springs with varyingdegrees of nitrate contamination. The sampledsprings are located along the Santa Fe andSuwannee Rivers in northcentral Florida. Fishwere selected if they were mature. This wasjudged by size in the ﬁeld and conﬁrmed dur-ing necropsy based on presence of differenti-ated follicles. Mature fish from the sampledsprings exhibited a standard length ≥2 cm.
As ﬁsh were captured, they were randomly
parsed into one of two groups. Fish placed inthe group for estradiol analysis ( n= 13–17 per
spring) were immediately chilled on ice. Fishused for necropsy ( n= 30 per spring) were
taken live to the laboratory, using aeratedcoolers ﬁlled with water taken from the cap-ture site. Fish in the necropsy group were dis-sected within 1 day of capture to examineovarian and hepatic weight, embryo number,and embryo dry and wet weight.
On the day of the collection, between 1200
and 1500 hr, water quality data were obtainedat the location where ﬁsh were captured. Watertemperature, pH, and conductivity were meas-ured using a handheld Ultrameter (Model 6P;Myron L Company, Carlsbad, CA). Dissolvedoxygen was measured using a YSI oxygen probe(Model 550A; YSI Life Sciences, YellowSprings, OH). In addition, water samples werefiltered through a 1-µm glass fiber filter(Millipore Cat. No. AP4004700), chilled onice, and stored at –20°C until they were ana-lyzed for nitrate using an auto-analyzer(Bran+Luebbe Technicon II with colorimeter;Bran+Luebbe, Buffalo Grove, IL). This methoduses a copper–cadmium column to reducenitrate to nitrite, which then reacts to form acolored solution that can be assayed colorimet-rically. Therefore, nitrate concentrations arereported as parts per million (milligrams perliter) nitrogen in the form of nitrate and nitritecombined (NO
3–N).
Unlike most surface water sites, spring
water arises from ground water sources. Waterquality and chemistry of spring water primar-ily reﬂect the composition of the undergroundaquifer rock with which it comes in contactduring its time underground (residence time)(Scott et al. 2004). This fact suggests thatwater quality of spring water is more stableover time compared with that of other surfacewaters. Residence times range from severaldays to thousands of years, depending on thegeology and ﬂow rate of the spring [reviewedin Scott et al. (2004)]. Our study depends onwater data taken only at the time of our ﬁsh
collections; therefore, we cannot describe tem-poral variation in water quality. However,given the underground source of spring water,it is likely that our measured values are repre-sentative of spring conditions over the shortterm (weeks to months and possibly years)preceding our study. This statement is sup-ported by other water data we collected during2003 (unpublished data) and the emergingdatabase on spring water quality initiated byFlorida’s Suwannee River Water ManagementDistrict (available online at http://www.srwmd.state.fl.us/water+data/surfacewater+quality/search+surfacewater+quality+data.asp?county_code=F001&Submit=GO).
Body size and dissections. Adult standard
length (SL) was measured to the nearest0.01 cm from the snout tip to the caudalpeduncle using calipers. Fish were blotted dryand weighed with an electronic balance to thenearest milligram. Ovaries and livers wereremoved and weighed to the nearest 0.1 mg.Ovarian wet weight ranged from 1.6 to874.2 mg, ovarian dry weight ranged from 0.3to 200.3 mg, and hepatic weight ranged from1.6 to 94.8 mg. Mature females were consid-ered reproductive if their ovaries contained atleast one vitellogenic (yellow rather than white)oocyte. To assess fecundity, we determined thedevelopmental stage of the oocytes/embryos[based on Haynes (1995)], and countedembryos that were stage 3 or older (postfertil-ization). Counted embryos were dried in anoven for 24 hr at 40°C. In Gambusia , embryos
develop within the ovary in synchronized wavesand account for most of the ovarian weight.Therefore, mean embryo weight, both wet anddry, for each female was calculated by dividingthe total wet and dry weight of a brood by theembryo number (Meffe and Snelson 1993).For stage 11 embryos (just before birth), wetweights are slightly exaggerated by the pres-ence of yolked ovarian follicles under develop-ment as part of the subsequent brood. 
Estradiol concentration. 17β-Estradiol
concentrations were measured on extracts ofmosquitoﬁsh tissue using enzyme immunoas-say (EIA) kits (Cat No. 582251) purchasedfrom Cayman Chemical Company (AnnArbor, MI) and validated in our lab for thispurpose. All body tissue posterior to the gonadand anal ﬁn was collected from each ﬁsh, andthe fresh wet weight obtained after the caudalﬁn was removed. This tissue is primarily mus-cle and will be referred to as muscle for theremainder of the article. Tissue was stored at–80°C until it was thawed on ice, homoge-nized in 1 mL 65 mM borate buffer (pH 8.0),and extracted twice with 5 mL diethyl ether.For each extraction, the ether and homogenatewere mixed for 2 min using a multitube vortexmixer. For the first extraction, tubes wereallowed to settle for three minutes to separatephases. For the second extraction, phases were
separated by centrifugation for 2 min. Afterphase separation, the aqueous portion wasfrozen in a methanol bath chilled to –25°Cwith dry ice. The lipophilic layers from bothextractions were combined in a new tube, andthe ether was evaporated under dry forced air.Dry extract was reconstituted in up to 4 mLEIA buffer and diluted as necessary (up to1:100) so that samples would fall within therange of the standard curve. EIAs were run asrecommended by Cayman with an 18-hrrefrigerated incubation to increase sensitivity.Data were quantiﬁed against a standard curvethat was linearized using a logit transformationof B/Bo (bound sample/maximum bound). 
Statistics. At the beginning of our analysis,
we intended to evaluate relationships betweenwater quality factors, such as nitrate, and vari-ous measured reproductive variables. However,as we progressed through the analysis, it becameclear that several response variables were inter-related and that these relationships needed tobe described before we could examine theinﬂuence of water quality on reproduction. 
Relationships among reproductive vari-
ables. To examine how different reproductive
variables related to each other, we combinedthe study populations and constructed a corre-lation matrix based on data from individualfish. Estradiol concentrations were notincluded in the matrix because they were mea-sured on a separate subset of ﬁsh (separate sub-sets were used to avoid altered sex steroidconcentrations due to capture stress). Toimprove linearity, all data (except embryostage) were log
10transformed. After the corre-
lation analysis, co-linear pairwise combinationsof reproductive variables were visualized usingsimple regression. Ovarian weight, embryonumber, and embryo wet weight were stronglyrelated to more than one other response vari-able. Therefore, for these variables, we usedforward stepwise regression to rank the relativeimportance of each regressor. 
Relationships among water quality
parameters and reproductive variables. To
determine which environmental parameterswere important predictors of the measuredreproductive variables, we used forward step-wise regression. Sampling order (expressed asdays since ﬁrst day of sampling) and the ﬁvewater parameters (NO
3–N, temperature, con-
ductivity, dissolved oxygen, pH), expressed asa mean for each spring, were entered as inde-pendent variables. Their collective statisticalinfluence was evaluated for each dependentvariable, also expressed as a mean or adjustedmean. Adjusted means, based on a commonregression slope, were calculated usingANCOVA following log-log transformation.Dependent variables included body size (SL,weight) and condition [expressed as mean(log
10 weight) adjusted for (log 10 SL)], estradiolEdwards et al.

(wet and dry), number of nonreproductive,mature females captured (of 30 total fromeach spring), hepatic weight adjusted for bodyweight, and embryo number adjusted for stan-dard length. Results from the correlation/sim-ple regression analyses indicated that embryonumber correlated positively with both stan-dard length ( r
2= 0.64, p< 0.0001) and mater-
nal body weight ( r2= 0.74, p< 0.0001).
However, compared with body weight, SL is amore appropriate covariate because it is inde-pendent of the response variable (embryonumber). 
When more than one independent vari-
able entered into the stepwise model, we cal-culated partial correlation coefﬁcients using apartial correlation matrix of the dependentand relevant independent variables.
Possible colinearities between pairs of
independent variables were assessed using acorrelation matrix. No signiﬁcant co-linearitieswere detected among water quality parameters(r
2< 0.41, p> 0.09 for all pairwise correla-
tions). However, nitrate concentration andsampling date were (unintentionally) corre-lated ( r
2= 0.5, p= 0.05); that is, the two high
nitrate springs were sampled ﬁrst.
At the conclusion of the stepwise analysis,
we visualized the effects of single independentvariables (water parameters) on individualresponse variables (averaged for each spring)using simple linear regression. We observedthat temperature was an important predictorfor several reproductive variables. However,for all these variables, particularly condition, thesigniﬁcant inﬂuence of temperature was drivenby a lower temperature at Ruth Spring. Thetemperature of Ruth Spring was 0.9–1.8°C lessthan that of the other seven sites. Given thatthis difference is apparently small, we repeatedthe stepwise analysis after excluding tempera-ture as an independent variable.
In addition to the above stepwise analysis,
log
10 (E2+ 1)-transformed estradiol concen-
trations were also compared among ﬁsh fromthe different springs using analysis of variance(ANOVA). Adjusted means were calculated(using a common regression slope for all sites)and compared using an analysis of covariance(ANCOVA) model in SPSS, version 12.0(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Homogeneity ofslopes was confirmed for all tests. All otheranalyses were performed using Statview 5.0(SAS Institute, Cary, NC), and results wereconsidered signiﬁcant at α= 0.05.
Outliers. During the analysis, we omitted
three measured estradiol values (2.5%) thatwere more than three SD values from themean for all fish in the study. One femalefrom Ruth Spring was omitted because sheexhibited unusually high fecundity comparedwith the mean for all females in the study(245 vs. an average of 27 embryos in ovario ).Results
Relationships among reproductive variables.
Standard length and female body mass (log 10-
log10 transformed) were highly correlated ( r2=
0.95) (Table 1). In addition, hepatic weightcorrelated positively with maternal body weight(r
2= 0.62) and embryo number correlated pos-
itively with SL ( r2= 0.64) (Tables 1 and 2).
Adjusted hepatic weight was influenced bystage of embryonic development, being highestduring the period of yolk deposition to theembryos (stages 0.5–2.5) and then dropping forthe remainder of gestation (Figure 1A). 
Ovarian weight and embryo number were
also inﬂuenced by other life history variables(Table 2). Gambusia embryos develop inside
the maternal ovary and, according to our data,consistently gain wet weight during the courseof gestation (as stage increases) (Figure 1B).Embryo dry weight also increases at the begin-ning of gestation but stabilizes betweenstages 4.5 and 8, then decreases as offspringapproach parturition (Figure 1C). Thereappears to be a tradeoff between embryo num-ber and embryo dry weight (but not wetweight), such that a female may have manysmaller embryos or fewer large ones (Tables 1and 2).The outcome of this tradeoff is inﬂu-enced by maternal body weight because largerfemales generally produce more offspring, andthose offspring exhibit increased wet weightsin a manner that may be stage-dependent(Table 2).
Water quality. Table 3 shows the collection
sites and provides abiotic water data. Rangesacross the eight springs for each water parame-ter were as follows: temperature: 21.4–23.2 °C;pH: 7.02–7.35; conductivity: 347–479 µS; dis-solved oxygen: 0.39–5.22 mg/L; and NO
3–N:
0.22–5.06 mg/L.Relationships between water quality and
reproduction. Detailed results of the stepwise
regression analyses are shown in Table 4. Thedirection of individual interactions is indicatedby the partial correlation coefficients. Withthe five water parameters included, nitratesignificantly predicted the number of non-reproductive females sampled from the springs(Figure 2). This correlation is confoundedby sampling date as we inadvertently sampledthe two high nitrate springs (Fanning andRuth) ﬁrst.
Temperature exhibited a negative relation-
ship with condition and adjusted embryonumber (Figure 3), and a positive relationshipwith embryo dry weight. Embryo dry weightwas also related negatively to nitrate (Table 4).However, for these three variables, the inﬂu-ence of temperature appears to be driven bythe Ruth Spring data point, which is coolerthan the other sites by < 2°C. If Ruth Spring isexcluded from the model, the negative rela-tionship between temperature and adjustedembryo number becomes marginal ( r
2= 0.53,
p=0.06), and the relationships between tem-
perature and condition or embryo dry weightare lost ( p> 0.3).
With temperature excluded from the list
of potential independent variables in the step-wise model, we found that nitrate still playeda significant role in predicting embryo dryweight (negative relationship, Figure 4). Wechecked our data to be sure that this negativeassociation between nitrate and embryo dryweight could not be explained by differencesin stage among embryos from differentsprings (Figure 1C). However, this relation-ship is again driven by data from RuthSpring. If Ruth Spring is removed from theanalysis, the relationship between embryo dryWater quality affects female Gambusia

bEmbryo wet weight was positively correlated with both stage (shown) and maternal body weight ( r2= 0.21, p< 0.0001).
However, when both are included in a stepwise regression model for embryo wet weight, only stage enters the model.weight and nitrate concentration becomes
nonsigniﬁcant ( p= 0.4).
Dissolved oxygen was the only variable to
enter into the stepwise model for predictingadjusted hepatic weight (Figure 5). Again, thisassociation between oxygen concentration andhepatic weight could not be explained by dif-ferences in developmental stage of the embryos(Figure 1A). Based on our data, embryo wetweight and maternal estradiol concentrationswere not inﬂuenced by the water quality para-meters we measured (Table 4, Figure 6).In addition, we did not observe signiﬁcant dif-ferences in muscle estradiol concentrationsamong springs ( p=0.15).
Discussion
At the outset of our study, we hypothesized
that low concentrations of environmentalnitrate would be related to changes in repro-duction and growth of mosquitoﬁsh capturedfrom Florida springs based on a hypotheseswe had developed previously (Guillette andEdwards 2005). With all springs included,our data indicate a significant associationbetween increasing nitrate and reducedembryo dry weight. We also observed a strongrelationship between increased nitrate andreduced reproductive activity among maturefemales. In addition to these ﬁndings regard-ing nitrate, we observed that many of themeasured reproductive variables were inter-related, as expected from previous studies ofthe reproductive biology of vertebrates.Finally, variation in Gambusia body size and
embryo number and dry weight were relatedto temperature, and hepatic weight wasrelated to dissolved oxygen concentration.
Relationship between nitrate and reduced
embryo dry weight. We hypothesize that the
observed negative relationship between nitrateand embryo dry weight is due to nitrate-induced alterations in endocrine function. Ithas been shown that nitrate can influencenitric oxide synthesis as well as cellular ionconcentrations and enzyme actions. Our datadid not pinpoint a mechanism of action forthe observed change in embryo dry weight.One plausible mechanism could involve alter-ations in thyroid function. Although the rela-tionship between nitrate and embryo dryweight was primarily driven by data obtainedfrom Ruth Spring (which had the highestnitrate concentration of the springs tested),the observation is worthy of further consider-ation. Environmentally relevant concentra-tions of nitrate have been shown to reducethyroid function, feeding behavior, andgrowth rate in a variety of vertebrates such assharks, amphibians, and mammals (Allenet al. 1996; Crow et al. 1998; Jahreis et al.1991; Schuytema and Nebeker 1999; Zakiet al. 2004; Zraly et al. 1997). Nitrate expo-sure has been associated with goiter andEdwards et al.

reproductive activity. In addition to the
observed relationship between low embryonicgrowth and nitrate, we noted that the numberof reproductive females captured during sam-pling was negatively related to nitrate concen-tration. That is, as nitrate levels went up, fewerreproductive females (less than 54% inFanning Spring) were captured relative to thetotal number of sexually mature femalescaught. This correlation is confounded by sam-pling date as we inadvertently sampled the twohigh nitrate springs (Fanning and Ruth) ﬁrst.However, on the basis of other Gambusia life
history studies, we reason that it is unlikelythat differences in sampling date fully explainthe observed variation in number of reproduc-tively active females. First, Koya and Kamiya(2000) reported that vitellogenesis and preg-nancy in Gambusia affinis require threshold
temperatures of 14°C and 18°C, respectively,regardless of daylength. Data taken in February2003 and again during collections in May2003 indicate that water temperature in bothsprings exceeded 21°C in both February andMay (Edwards TM, unpublished data;Suwannee River Water Management Districtonline searchable database (http://www.
srwmd.state.fl.us/water+data/surfacewater+quality/search+surfacewater+quality+data.asp?county_code=F001&Submit=GO). Second,data collected in 2001 and 2002 from G. hol-
brooki populations in lakes in central Florida
predict that pregnancy rates in May should be≥90% (Edwards 2005).
Because Gambusia incorporate yolk into
oocytes before fertilization (Koya et al. 2000),our observation of reduced reproductive activ-ity in association with increased nitrate expo-sure does not imply disrupted fertilization.Rather, it suggests that nitrate, or its metabo-lites (nitrite, nitric oxide) can inﬂuence someaspect of vitellogenesis or vitellogenin seques-tering during oogenesis. Vitellogenesis occursin the liver and is stimulated by estrogens(Tolar et al. 2001). If estrogens are decreasedby nitrate or by its metabolites (as hypothe-sized in our introduction), then vitellogenesiscould be similarly decreased. Yamagata et al.(2002) demonstrated that in vitro steroido-
genesis by rat granulosa cells could bedecreased by exposure to a nitric oxide donor.We did not ﬁnd a relationship between estra-diol concentration in the body tissue andnitrate concentrations in the springs. Nor didwe observe a relationship between estradiol andfrequency of reproductive females. However, itis possible that nitrate may alter the action ofestradiol in the liver. Alternatively, the reducedfrequency of reproductively active femalescould be due to a delayed onset of seasonalreproductive activity among some femalesin the population. Both hypotheses requirefurther testing.
Interrelated reproductive variables—
implications for the gonadosomatic index. Our
data show that the relationship between ovar-ian weight and body mass, traditionallyexpressed as the gonadosomatic index (GSI), is
complicated by gestational wet weight gain andalso embryo number, which in turn is influ-enced by maternal body mass and embryo dryweight (Table 2). Since females in any givenpopulation are not synchronized with regard togestational stage, it could be misleading tocompare populations using GSI as a singularmeasure of reproductive health or fecundity (asis a common practice in the piscine literature)without knowing the gestational stage ordegree of tradeoff between embryo size andnumber. We discourage the use of GSI for thispurpose in future mosquitoﬁsh studies.

aNumber of nonreproductive females was also explained by sampling date, which correlated with nitrate concentration
(see Table 3 for sampling dates). bWith the exception of the robust relationship between temperature and embryo num-
ber, the signiﬁcant inﬂuence of temperature is largely driven by a lower temperature at Ruth Spring, which is 0.9 to –1.8°Cless than that at the other seven sites. Given that this is a seemingly small difference, we repeated the stepwise analysisafter excluding temperature as an independent variable.50

r2= 0.56, p= 0.003.Relationship between hepatic weight and
dissolved oxygen. Hypoxia in the springs was
related to increased adjusted hepatic weightand explained 84% of the variance in thisvariable. In cultured mammalian hepatocytesand whole animals ,hypoxia and related aci-
dosis stimulate sodium accumulation in livercells, which causes cell swelling. If thisswelling is not excessive, the cell membranewill remain intact and the cell will avoidnecrosis (Carini et al. 1999). In addition,necrosis is also avoided if hepatocytes are pre-conditioned by early but intermittent expo-sure to hypoxia (Carini et al. 2001), as maybe the case for wild Gambusia . We informally
screened hepatic histology for several malefish captured with the females in our studyand did not observe necrotic cells in ﬁsh fromlow or high oxygen sites.
Matrotrophy. We have noted in the litera-
ture that Gambusia are classified as lecitho-
trophs (Constantz 1989). However, our datasuggest that Gambusia are matrotrophic, at
least during the first two thirds of develop-ment (through stage 8), when both embryodry weight and wet weight are stable or rising(Figures 1B, C). Meffe and Snelson (1993)observed a similar increase in Gambusia
embryo dry weight during gestation. In ourstudy, hepatic weight (adjusted for bodyweight) was highest during the period of yolkdeposition to the embryos (stages 0.5–2.5)
(Figure 1A) and then dropped for the remain-der of gestation. This suggests that vitellogene-sis is greatest at the beginning of gestation(Koya et al. 2000). Although vitellogenesisapparently drops by stage 3, embryos gain ormaintain dry weight through to stage 8.Between stages 8 and 11, the yolk sac dimin-ishes rapidly and some dry weight is lost(Figure 1C). On the basis of these observa-tions, we suggest that Gambusia exhibit some
direct, matrotrophic support of embryogrowth during the ﬁrst two thirds of develop-ment and rely on egg yolk reserves for thecompletion of gestation. This observation ofmatrotrophy in Gambusia is supported by
other recent evidence of maternal nutrienttransfer (Marsh-Matthews et al. 2001). Thegain in wet weight before birth (a 4-foldincrease on average) could be adaptive in thatlarger larvae often exhibit better survivorship(Hare and Cowen 1997).
Conclusion
Our data suggest that growth and reproductiveparameters in Gambusia are highly interrelated
and subject to inﬂuence from a variety of envi-ronmental factors, including nitrate, tempera-ture, and dissolved oxygen. In particular,nitrate exposure is related to reduced dryweight of developing Gambusia embryos dur-
ing gestation and reduced rate of reproductiveactivity among mature females. These ﬁndings,along with those of other studies cited here,suggest that nitrate could act as an endocrinedisruptor as previously suggested (Guillette andEdwards 2005), thereby affecting signaling pat-terns associated with the thyroid, liver, andgonad. The mechanisms associated with thesealterations require extensive study becausenitrate contamination of aquatic ecosystems isa major global concern.
