Reuse for agricultural purposes of aquaculture wastewater containing high levels of nutrients can be
integrated into a water management strategy, in order to conserve water and alleviate water pollution
problems. However, rather than nutrients, some contaminants in aquaculture wastewater may pose
detrimental effects on plants being nourished. This study assessed the growth and accumulation of toxic
substances of Brassica chinensis in response to Malachite Green (MG)-contaminated water. Plant seed-
lings were hydroponically grown with MG at 1 mg/L, 2 mg/L or 4 mg/L under ambient air conditions in
the laboratory for 4 wk. Growth parameters dthe number of leaves, plant height, leaf length and width,
root length and dry mass of the plants dwere compared with plants grown without MG (control). The
concentrations at 2 mg/L and 4 mg/L affected the growth of the plants as measured by leaf length, plant
height and leaf width generally to a lesser degree than the control plants and those grown at 1 mg/L MG
(p<0.05). The roots of plants were clearly affected by MG (average root length ¼14.00 ±1.17 cm,
14.50 ±3.91 cm, 7.17 ±1.52 cm and 6.58 ±0.94 cm for plants from the control and treatments with MG at
1 mg/L, 2 mg/L and 4 mg/L, respectively, p<0.001). The dry mass of treated plants (average dry
mass ¼1.22±0.48 g/plant, 1.17 ±0.27 g/plant and 0.86 ±0.17 g/plant for treatments of MG at 1 mg/L,
2 mg/L and 4 mg/L, respectively) were lower than that of control plants (1.80 ±0.73 g/plant) ( p<0.001).
The increase in the oxalate content in the plant shoots suggested that the plants may accumulate sub-
stances that could be harmful to human health. Based on these results, it is proposed that the integration
of hydroponic plant production with MG-contaminated water at a concentration not exceeding 1 mg/L
can be applied without any reduction in the productivity of B. chinensis ; however, the accumulation of
toxic substances in plant tissues still needs to be identi ﬁed.

Introduction
Malachite Green (MG), a triphenylmethane dye, is a multiple-
use compound that is mainly used in textile industries and partly
used in aquaculture in fungicides and ectoparasiticides (Srivastava
et al., 2004; Fu et al., 2013). While the effects of MG on aquatic
invertebrates and algae have been scarcely elucidated (Sudova
et al., 2007), Hidayah et al. (2013) reported that MG in waste-
water from either industry or aquaculture has been widely reported
to be toxic to many kinds of ﬁsh with lethal effects at a concen-
tration of less than 1 mg/L, with the dye and its derivatives being
accumulated in aquaculture products such as ﬁsh, prawn and crab.
It also possesses carcinogenic and genotoxic properties which posea potential risk to humans and therefore, this dye has been banned
in Europe, the USA and several countries (Srivastava et al., 2004).
However, MG is still being used in some parts of the world because
it is highly effective and easily available at low cost (Srivastava et al.,
2004). It is also used domestically as a treatment for diseases of
tropical ﬁsh and can be readily obtained by the public (Culp and
Beland, 1996); hence, concern about its illegal use exists
(Mitrowska et al., 2005). In Asian countries such as Bangladesh, MG
has been reported to be used for the eradication of external para-
sites and fungal diseases in ﬁsh farming (Shamsuzzaman and
Biswas, 2012). However, removal of MG from aquaculture waste-
water has received little or no attention compared to other pol-
lutants. Consequently, contamination of MG in aquaculture waste
could be expected with harmful consequences to the surrounding
environment.
Efﬂuents from aquaculture usually contain high amounts of
nutrients such as nitrogen (ammonia, nitrite and nitrate),*Corresponding author.

algal bloom in receiving water (Miller and Semmens, 2002 )o r ,i f
high enough, can support vegetable production (Yeo et al., 2004).
To reduce water pollution problems, ﬁshery industries in many
countries including Thailand have been forced to treat their ef ﬂuent
in proper ways such as by the rational use of water and by the re-
covery of substances from wastewater (Gonz /C19alez, 1995 ). Hence,
efﬂuents from aquaculture have been used for garden applications
or the production of hydroponic plants as a secondary treatment in
the waste management procedure (Miller and Semmens, 2002). In
some management practices, such as the study by Somboonchai
and Chaibu (2013), four vegetables were grown in a hydroponic
system integrated with cat ﬁsh culture. However, the ef ﬂuents from
aquaculture such as shrimp farming contain not only nutrients but
also other chemical substances such as antibiotics, herbicides and
fungicides that potentially impact on the environment
(Anantanasuwong, 2001). A review by Carvalho et al. (2014) indi-
cated that pharmaceutical products, including antibiotics, hor-
mones, analgesics and anti-in ﬂammatory drugs, chemical
compounds used for disinfection and cleaning, and endocrine-
disrupting compounds can be assimilated by the plants. There-
fore, while the potential for biomass production and nutrients re-
covery from wastewater are primary concerns in wastewater
management systems (Turcios and Papenbrock, 2014), bio-
accumulation of toxic substances is another aspect of concern.
Additionally, increasing water scarcity in either dry regions of the
world or in developing countries makes the reuse of wastewater in
agriculture more important (Blumenthal et al., 2000). Nevertheless,
it is of interest to identify whether or not a practice is productive
and safe for both the environment and human health.
Several plant species can tolerate toxic substances by accumu-
lating them in non-toxic forms or transforming them to either non-
toxic or less toxic products. Most studies showed that textile dyes
can be either adsorbed and accumulated or transformed to less or
non-toxic substances by detoxifying enzymes, predominantly
peroxidase, in plant cells (Govindwar and Kagalkar, 2010). The dye
MG was found to be transformed to 4-dimethylamino-cyclohexa-
2,4 dienone in Blumea malcolmii Hook. using enzyme laccase and
the products had less toxicity toward Phaseolous mungo and Triti-
cum aestivum when tested (Kagalkar et al., 2011). Rai et al. (2014)
found that biodegradation of MG by Aloe barbadensis resulted in
nontoxic metabolites, suggesting the possibility of using treated,
dye wastewater for irrigation. Torbati (2016) reported that activity
of antioxidative enzymes, namely SOD, POD and CAT, in Spirodela
polyrhiza L. was increased with increased MG in the bathing me-
dium. The activity of these enzymes allowed the species to tolerate
MG at concentrations of 10 mg/L and 20 mg/L. However, knowledge
on the degradation of synthetic dyes by vegetable plants is scarce
since phytotransformation has been studied mainly in non-edible
plants. Nowadays, the trend toward eco-friendly and sustainable
production of any kind of product strongly in ﬂuences consumers.
The current study investigated the application of wastewater
containing MG from aquaculture for the production of pak choy
(Brassica chinensis Tsen &Lee), a vegetable that is produced
commercially in many Asian countries. It was hypothesized that
being a member of the genus Brassica whose species usually have
high antioxidant enzyme activity upon exposure to toxic sub-
stances (for example, Felicite et al., 2007; Song et al., 2009; Ma
et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2014), B. chinensis may have ability to
degrade MG dye and, hence, tolerate the dye at the low concen-
tration used in aquaculture. If so, the reuse of water contaminated
with MG could be applied. However, some Brassica species such as
cabbage ( Brassica rapa var. pekinensis ) and Wisconsin fast plants
(Brassica rapa ) could take up and accumulate some toxic substances
in their tissue, especially in the roots (Herklotz et al., 2010;Szczyg łowska et al., 2011). Therefore, on the other hand, the MG
dye in water may be accumulated in plant tissue and inhibit growth
of the plant. Thus, the aims of this study were: 1) to study the ef-
fects of MG on the growth of B. chinensis and 2) to evaluate the
accumulation of toxic substances in the edible parts of B. chinensis .
Theﬁndings from this study will be useful for consideration in a
wastewater management strategy, particularly for the reuse of
aquaculture wastewater in crop irrigation.
Materials and methods
Plant materials
Seeds of pak choy ( Brassica chinensis Tsen &Lee) were
commercially obtained (Jet Plane Brand; Chia Tai Group Limited
Company; Bangkok, Thailand) and germinated on a moistened
sponge in the dark. When the seedlings were age 7 d, the nutrient
mixed solution was applied replacing water, and the seedlings were
allowed to grow under ambient conditions to age 14 d before being
transferred to the growth medium used in the growth experiment.
Fourteen-day-old seedlings with 3 e5 leaves and an average
height of 8 cm were selected for the growth experiment. The
seedlings were grown in nutrient mixed solution for 1 wk to allow
for acclimation to the hydroponic growth conditions. The nutrient
mixed solution was prepared from tap water and 1 ml/L of com-
mercial A and B nutrient solution for hydroponic planting (Zen
Hydroponics; Chiang Mai, Thailand). The pH and electrical con-
ductivity (EC) of the nutrient mixed solution were monitored and
maintained at 6.0 e6.5 and 1.5 e2.5 ms/cm, respectively.
Growth experiment
After 1 wk acclimation, 48 seedlings were distributed to four
levels of MG concentration treatments: 0 mg/L (control), 1 mg/L,
2 mg/L and 4 mg/L ( n¼12). The basal part of each seedling was
ﬁtted in a small plastic basket to hold the plant in an upright po-
sition and the baskets were ﬁxed on the lids of 5 L plastic tub
containers. One container with 12 seedlings was used for each
treatment. The chemical formula of the MG used was C 23H25N2Cl
(analytical grade; Sigma-Aldrich; St Louis, MO, USA). The concen-
tration of each treatment was obtained by adding the appropriate
volume to make up 500 mg/L of MG stock solution to the nutrient
mixed solution which hereafter is called the growth solution. The
pH and EC of the growth solution were monitored and maintained
as mentioned above and the growth solutions were renewed
weekly. The experiment was maintained under ambient conditions
with the air temperature 24 e29/C14C, relative humidity 41 e60% and
natural sunlight. Decolorization of MG in the growth solution at day
7 was detected spectrophotometrically using an ultraviolet evisible
spectrophotometer (UV-1800; Shimadzu, Japan). The solution from
each treatment (10 mL) was sampled and measured for absorbance
at 400e800 nm compared with the absorbance of freshly prepared
solution at the same concentration.
After 4 wk of growing, growth parameters (number of leaves,
leaf length and width, shoot height and root length) were
measured. Then, all plants were harvested and each plant was
separated into root and shoot (leaves þstem) parts, and the shoots
were stored at /C070/C14C in a freezer for further tissue analysis. The
roots were abandoned since it is normally a non-used part of this
vegetable and it was impossible to separate the plant roots from the
supporting sponge. The weight of the shoot was measured after
drying in a hot-air oven at 60/C14C for 48 h and the ﬁnal dry mass
(DM) was determined. The experiment was conducted between
February and March.P. Matpang et al. / Agriculture and Natural Resources 51 (2017) 96 e102 97Tissue analysis
As the dry biomass of each individual plant sample (range
0.8e1.8 g) was not suf ﬁcient for measurement of all tissue content
parameters, oven-dried plant materials from each treatment
(n¼12) were pooled together and then cut into small pieces and
mixed homogeneously before using in tissue analyses. The analyses
of total N and oxalate were done in three replicates and since there
were no differences among the groups of each treatment, the
average of the three replicates was used for further analysis.
Total N and total oxalate contents
A plant sample (0.5 g) was used for analysis of the nitrogen
content using the Kjeldahl method (Tennyson and Winlers, 2000)
with slight modi ﬁcation. Each sample was digested with concen-
trated HCl prior to distillation. The NH 3(g) was trapped by boric
acid during distillation. Finally, the amount of borate was quanti ﬁed
by titration with HCL. Then, the amount of HCL at the end point was
used to calculate the nitrogen content. The total oxalate concen-
tration was analyzed based on the method modi ﬁed from Munro
and Bassir (1969) using 1.0 g of dry plant material. Brie ﬂy, plant
sample powder was extracted thrice by warming with 0.3N HCl
(40e50/C14C). Then the extract was precipitated with 5% CaCl 2in
acidic conditions. The precipitate was later re-dissolved in warmed
3N H 2SO4(70e80/C14C). The solution obtained was further titrated
with 0.01N KMnO 4to determine the oxalate content. The analysis
of plant tissue from each treatment was done in three replicates.
Attenuated total re ﬂectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
analysis
The functional groups present in the MG dye structure and the
functional groups potentially obtained from MG degradation in
plant tissue were analyzed using attenuated total re ﬂectance
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) (Spectrum One
model; Perkin-Elmer; Beacons ﬁeld, UK). For the ATR-FTIR analysis,
the samples were directly placed into the sample cell and the ATR-
FTIR spectra of samples were scanned in the range 4000 e650/cm.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS version 22.0
software package (SPSS Inc.; Chicago, IL, USA). All data were tested
for homogeneity of variance using Levene's test. Differences within
groups were tested. Treatments effects on plant growth were
determined by analysis of variance using type III sums of squares.
Multiple comparisons of means at the 95% con ﬁdent level were
performed using Duncan's procedure.
Results
After 4 wk, plants grown in the solution with MG at a concen-
tration of 2 mg/L or 4 mg/L had prominently stunted roots with
blue-staining on the root surfaces. The depletion of the blue
coloration in the solution was also observed and ultraviolet evisible
spectrophotometric analysis (400 e800 nm) of the growth solutions
showed decreasing absorbance at 618 nm, which is the absorption
maxima of MG, in all growth solutions after 1 wk of growth
compared to freshly prepared solution (data not shown).
Effects of MG on plant growth
After 4 wk of growth, the size of the control plants and those
grown at 1 mg/L MG were generally similar and signi ﬁcantly largerthan the plants grown at 2 mg/L or 4 mg/L MG. Leaves of plants
grown on solution without MG or with 1 mg/L MG were signi ﬁ-
cantly longer and wider than those of the plants grown on solution
added with MG at a concentration of 2 mg/L or 4 mg/L ( p<0.001).
The roots of the plants grown at 2 mg/L or 4 mg/L MG were
signiﬁcantly shorter than those of the plants grown on solution
without MG or with 1 mg/L MG ( p<0.001). The effects of MG on
plant growth were also evident in the plant dry mass which was
signiﬁcantly reduced with increased MG concentrations in the
growth solutions ( p<0.001) as shown in Table 1.
Tissue contents
The total N and oxalate contents in the plant shoots are pre-
sented in Table 2. Plants exposed to MG at all concentrations had a
signiﬁcantly higher total nitrogen content than plants in the control
group ( p<0.001). However, the nitrogen contents were not
different among the treatments with MG of 1 mg/L, 2 mg/L or 4 mg/
L. The total oxalate content in the shoots of plants grown in nutrient
solution with MG were signi ﬁcantly higher than that of plants
grown without MG ( p<0.001).
Attenuated total re ﬂectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
analysis
To compare functional groups present in MG and in plant tis-
sues, ATR-FTIR analysis was performed in MG, in the plants grown
without MG serving as a control and in the plants grown in MG-
contaminated water at a concentration of 1 mg/L or 2 mg/L. The
plants from the treatment with 1 mg/L were subjected to this
analysis as their growth was nearly unaffected by the dye and the
plants from treatment of 2 mg/L were selected as representative of
the affected plants. The results are presented in Fig. 1 and Table 3.
The ATR-FTIR analysis of MG (Fig. 1A) resulted in peaks at 690/
cm for the CH 2stretch, a peak at 1445/cm for the C eH stretch, a
peak at 1579/cm for the C ]C stretch, a peak at 2810 e2860/cm for
the CeH stretch and a peak at 3403/cm for the O eH stretch; these
results show the typical peaks of the MG used in this study. The
ATR-FTIR spectra of the plants grown in solution with or without
MG (Fig. 1B eD) showed the typical spectra of the plants which
peaks at 1010 e1097/cm for the C eOH bending, peaks at
1603e1618/cm for the C ]C stretch, has a peak at 2916/cm for the
CeH stretch and peaks at 3276 e3283/cm for the O eH stretch. A
prominent difference in the ATR-FTIR spectra between plant
treatments was found in plants grown on 2 mg/L MG (Fig. 1D),
where the peak at 670 e690/cm occurred.
Discussion
The effects of MG on plant species have been mostly tested using
seed germination and the plant seedling stage, with germination
and seedling development being generally inhibited (for example,
Kagalkar et al., 2011; Gopinathan et al., 2015). The current study
found that MG contamination in water also caused negative effects
toB. chinensis , particularly at concentrations greater than 1 mg/L.
From the results, the negative effects of MG were strongly evi-
denced on root growth which was reduced by 50% upon exposure
to MG of 2 mg/L and 4 mg/L compared to the control or 1 mg/L MG
treatments. Similar effects on root growth were found in Arabi-
dopsis thaliana grown on medium supplied with 4 mg/L of Crystal
Violet and MG (Fu et al., 2013). The stunted roots may contribute to
the overall reduction in plant growth since the uptake of water and
nutrients could occur only via root transport under the hydroponic
growth conditions used in this study. Nevertheless, the overallP. Matpang et al. / Agriculture and Natural Resources 51 (2017) 96 e102 98growth of B. chinensis in the current study indicated that the plant
tolerates MG at a concentration of 1 mg/L.
MG has been suggested to be toxic to plants as it could be
strongly absorbed on the surface of cellulose (Buvaneswari and
Kannan, 2011) and taken up through the roots and accumulated
in plant tissues (Fu et al., 2013). Saranya et al. (2011) found that the
chlorophyll contents in Hydrilla verticillata decreased with
increasing Basic Violet 14 dye concentrations from 5 mg/L to 25 mg/
L, although the difference was not signi ﬁcant at 5 mg/L and 10 mg/L,
and this result supported the inhibition of the dye on chlorophyll
biosynthesis. In the current study, there was no evidence of chlo-
rosis in the B. chinensis leaves at the concentrations applied
(1e4 mg/L). However, the effect of MG on chlorophyll biosynthesis
in this plant species should be better explained by pigment
analysis.
Dye contamination in either the water or soil usually causes a
reduction in the total content of macromolecules such as proteins
and carbohydrates whilst it usually induces the activity of several
enzymes used for dye degradation in exposed organisms. Triphe-
nylmethane dyes such as Crystal Violet and Methyl Violet could
cause lower protein synthesis which consequently inhibited cell
growth in Bacillus subtilis (Ogawa et al., 1988). Jayanthy et al. (2014)
found that soil contaminated with dyes from dyeing industries
caused decreasing protein, total free amino acid and carbohydrate
contents in Vigna radiata , whilst in the same plant, there were in-
creases in the proline, glutathione and methyl glyoxal contents in
either leaf or root tissue which indicated a response to abiotic
stress. Moreover, the activities of lignin peroxidase, veratryl alcohol
oxidase, laccase, tyrosinase and DCIP reductase were induced in
Aster amellus Linn. and Glandularia pulchella (Sweet) Tronc. upon
exposure to the dye Remazol Orange 3R (Kabra et al., 2011). Ac-
cording to those ﬁndings, there was an elevated nitrogen content in
the shoot tissue of the plants, while plant growth was inhibited; in
the current study the elevated level likely re ﬂected an increase in
stress responses upon exposure to MG.
Several plants species have potential for dye decolorization
(Aubert and Schwitzgu /C19ebel, 2004; Ghodake et al., 2009; Khandare
et al., 2011; Rai et al., 2014). The decolorization of either the textile
efﬂuents or dye mixtures used can be achieved by adsorption and
accumulation on plant surfaces, and mostly by phyto-
transformation or phytodegradation dthe mechanism that de-
grades or transforms the dye into non-toxic products (Govindwarand Kagalkar, 2010). The degradation could be enhanced by
rhizosphere-associated microorganisms, by enzymes excreted from
or within roots (De Araujo et al., 2002: Davies et al., 2005) or even
by enzyme extracted from leaves (for example, Carias et al., 2007)
and cell cultures (for example, Kagalkar et al., 2011). In the current
study, the adsorption of the MG dye to root surfaces, as could be
seen by the blue staining, particularly in the treatments with MG of
2 mg/L or 4 mg/L, could be one mechanism that accounts for the
depletion of MG dye in the growth solution that occurred in this
study. According to Davies et al. (2005), adsorption of xenobiotics
followed by its absorption, allows the binding of xenobiotics to
plant roots. Retarded roots of B. chinensis growing with MG at 2 mg/
L or 4 mg/L suggests toxicity of MG to plant roots. It has been re-
ported that B. juncea has great potential for Reactive Red 2 degra-
dation which is supported by the activities of the enzyme laccase
and NADH-DCIP reductase predominantly present in roots
(Ghodake et al., 2009). Nevertheless, Mukherjee and Das (2014)
reported that the decolorized level of MG by Enterobacter asbur-
iaeStrain XJUHX-4TM decreased as the exposure time and con-
centration of the dye increased due to the toxicity of the dye to
bacterial cells. Detoxi ﬁcation of MG may be achieved through some
metabolic activities present in the roots. However, the 28 d of
exposure used in the current study and at higher concentrations
(2 mg/L or 4 mg/L) may have caused a reduction in the detoxi ﬁ-
cation ability of the plant and resulted in plant toxicity.
The results obtained from the FTIR analysis can be used as a tool
to predict the changes in the functional groups of the original dye
molecules (Govindwar and Kagalkar, 2010). The ATR-FTIR analysis
was performed in the study to detect whether or not there were
functional groups possibly obtained from MG that had accumulated
in the edible plant part. The ATR-FTIR spectra comparison between
plant samples from the control and treatment groups suggested
that at the concentration of 1 mg/L, MG may be transformed before
either being taken up by the plants or translocated into the shoot
tissue. Kagalkar et al. (2011) showed that Blumea malcolmii Hook.
could degrade MG dye and the degradation gave 4-dimethylamino-
cyclo-hexa-2,4 dienone as the transformed product. Fu et al. (2013)
found that transgenic Arabidopsis converted Crystal Violet to Lleu-
cocrystal Violet (LCV), which is non-toxic to the plant, and LCV was
then gradually degraded by other endogenous enzyme activities.
The products obtained from the phytotransformation of MG were
usually non-toxic to tested plant species in all phytotoxicity reportsTable 1

might explain the unaffected growth of B. chinensis in the growth
medium with a concentration of 1 mg/L MG, whilst the ATR-FTIR
spectra (with the peak at 670 e690/cm) suggest that there was a
similar functional group in MG and in the shoot of plants grown at
2 mg/L MG. Although it might be possible that the functional grouporiginated from MG or could have been obtained from MG degra-
dation, it could also be the substance synthesized by the plant in
response to MG. Hence, identi ﬁcation is still needed of the sub-
stances, using techniques such as high performance liquid chro-
matography mass spectrometry (Fu et al., 2013). Together with this
result, the effects on root growth at MG concentrations of 2 mg/L

cells and may result in the accumulation of toxic substances in the
shoot tissue of B. chinensis . The increased oxalate content in the
shoot tissues of plants exposed to MG in the current study might be
accounted for by an enhanced tolerance mechanism in the plant, as
Nilratnisakorn et al. (2008) suggested that the precipitation of
metal-dye complexes in leaves and roots as calcium oxalate, cal-
cium silicate and silica in Typha angustifolia Linn. (Narrow-leaved
Cattail) is the mechanism that avoids damage to plant cells.
With regard to the potential health risk of some bio-
accumulated substances in food products, the accumulation of
possibly toxic derivatives obtained from MG transformation such as
Leucomalachite Green (Srivastava et al., 2004) in plant tissues still
needs to be identi ﬁed. In addition, as oxalate comprises 75% of
kidney stones (Hesse and Siener, 1997) and consumption of high
oxalate foods can promote the risk of kidney stone formation
(Holmes and Assimos, 2004) in the human urinary tract, B. chinensis
grown with MG contaminated water in this study, having increased
the oxalate content, may pose a risk of kidney stone formation as
well.
The results of plant growth revealed that B. chinensis was able to
grow in water contaminated with MG at a concentration of 1 mg/L
and had the ability to remove the dye from contaminated water
through adsorption via its root surface. The tissue contents, total N
and total oxalate concentrations, and the ATR-FTIR spectra
analyzed in the current study indicated that the tolerance of the
plant to low levels of MG could be achieved by increasing stress
responses and the accumulation of toxic substances in oxalate
form, which hamper toxicity to plant cells. However, the plant
could not tolerate high concentrations (2 mg/L or 4 mg/L in this
study) of MG resulting in the increased accumulation of toxic
substances in plant tissue and the reduction of overall growth as a
consequence. A conclusion from the current study is that although
the integration of hydroponic plant production for wastewater
management in aquaculture that is still using the dye at a low
concentration can be applied without noticeable phytotoxicity
symptoms, this might pose a potential health risk for humans.
Hence, the detection and identi ﬁcation of substances accumulated
in plant tissue is still needed.
