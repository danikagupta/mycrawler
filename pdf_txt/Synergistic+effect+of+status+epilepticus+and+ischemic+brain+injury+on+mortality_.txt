Epileptologie 2017; 34 The Mortality of Status Epilepticus | A. NeliganSummary
Generalised Convulsive Status Epilepticus (SE), tra-
ditionally defined as a persistent generalised seizure 
lasting longer or intermittent generalised seizures with 
incomplete recovery of consciousness in between sei-
zures of duration longer than 30 minutes, is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In this review 
we examine the factors associated with high mortal-
ity and poor prognosis, in particular discuss prognosis associated with the major aetiologies of SE as well as the relative impact of other prognostic factors such as age and duration of SE. We also discuss whether the 
prognosis and associated mortality of SE has changed 
over time, particularly in the last 20 years in light of im -
proved treatment options and the increasing advocacy of earlier and more aggressive treatment in the context of prolonged seizures.

Introduction 
Generalised Convulsive Status Epilepticus (SE), tra-
ditionally defined as a persistent generalised seizure 
lasting longer or intermittent generalised seizures with 
incomplete recovery of consciousness in between sei-
zures of duration longer than 30 minutes, is associated with significant morbidity and mortality [1, 2]. 
Despite the fact that SE has been recognised at least 
since 700-600CE [1], it took until the early 1990s before 
the first staged treatment protocol for the manage-
ment of SE appeared [3]. This is perhaps for a long time, whilst the high associated mortality of SE was well known, that SE was a rare event, typically only seen in people with chronic epilepsy in long-term institutions The Mortality of Status Epilepticus154
Epileptologie 2017; 34 The Mortality of Status Epilepticus | A. Neliganor asylums and often in the context of anti-epileptic 
drug (AED) withdrawal [1, 2]. Moreover, it was only in the mid- to late 1990s that the first population cross-
sectional studies were published, permitting an accu-
rate estimation for the incidence rate of SE for the first time (Table 1). In addition, such studies provided a more accurate estimation of the associated mortality of SE as given the prospective nature of the studies, they were 
less prone to selection bias.
Any discussion on SE needs to be centred on three 
fundamental questions which will form the basis of the 
reminder of this review: 1) What is the overall mortal-
ity rate associated with SE? This is typically defined in 
terms of the 30-day case fatality rate or the propor -
tional mortality rate. 2) What factors determine the prognosis of SE and by extension the mortality rate? 3) Has the mortality rate associated with SE changed over 
time and if so why?Mortality rates in status epilepticus
In discussing the mortality of SE we will primarily 
focus on the results of seven cross-sectional studies [4 
- 10] published from Richmond, Virginia [4], Rochester, 
Minnesota [5], French-speaking Switzerland [6], Ger -
many [7], Bologna, Italy [8], California [9], and North 
London [10]. The first of the population-based studies was from Richmond, Virginia in 1995, with the second highest reported mortality rate of 22% [4]. This high 
mortality may in part be explainable by the high pro-
portion of African-Americans (20%) in this study, in whom the incidence of SE was three-fold that of white Americans [4]. This may have been in part due to socio-
economic factors and unequal access and quality of 
medical care for the different populations in this study. This finding of a higher incidence and higher associated mortality in African-Americans was replicated in the Californian study [9]. Of these studies, all but one was 
prospective in nature.  
Overall the incidence of SE typically ranged from 
10 - 20 cases per 100,000 person years although the re-

Epileptologie 2017; 34 The Mortality of Status Epilepticus | A. Neliganported incidence was significantly higher (41 - 61 per 
100,000 person years) in the Richmond study [4]. The overall mortality rate (30-day case fatalities) ranged 
from 3% in the paediatric study from North London [10] 
to 39% in the small study from Bologna, Italy [8] which seems to represent a significant outlier. The earlier American studies reported higher mortality rates (22% [4] and 19% [5]) compared to the later Swiss (7.6%) [6] 
and German (9.3%) [7] studies, which probably provide 
a more accurate and representative estimate of the mortality of SE. Of note the EPISTAR study excluded people with SE and post-anoxic encephalopathy which 
has the highest associated mortality, thereby explain -
ing the slightly lower mortality rate (7.6%) in this study 
[7]. Mortality in SE demonstrates a J-shape relation -
ship with age, with very low mortality rates in children, with increasing mortality rates with increasing age, 
particularly after the age of 60. In the Richmond study, 
the mortality rate was only 3% in children, comparable to that seen in the North London SE in Childhood Sur -
veillance Study (NLSTEPSS) [10], yet the mortality rate was 41% in those aged > 60 years [4]. This is in part mitigated by the fact that the aetiology of SE varies with age, with febrile SE (prolonged form of a febrile 
convulsion) making up about a third of cases of SE in 
children, which is associated with a very low mortality rate. In contrast post-anoxic SE, which is almost invari-ably fatal, is a significant cause of SE in the elderly [11]. 
 
 
The impact of aetiology on the prognosis
The number of causes that predominate in epide-
miological studies of SE is surprisingly small, with 7 - 8 major aetiologies typically identified [11]. In contrast, 
in a recent review of uncommon cause of SE, which 
were pragmatically defined as a single cause account -
ing for < 1% of all cases documented in the major pop -

Epileptologie 2017; 34 The Mortality of Status Epilepticus | A. Neliganulation studies (Table 1), identified 181 different un -
common causes of SE [12]. Inevitably rare causes, once 
identified will become increasingly recognised. This is 
particularly true of the autoimmune encephalopathies 
such as anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, which never -
theless overall remain a rare cause of SE, although is a more prevalent cause of refractory and supra-refractory SE. The major aetiologies and their relative frequency in 
the population studies are shown in Table 2. 
Specific Aetiologies of Status Epilepticus and 
Mortality
Stroke and status epilepticus
Stroke is a significant cause of SE in people aged > 
60 years particularily in those with no prior history of 
seizures (Table 2).In a comprehensive study of the frequency of SE 
post-stroke, 3,205 people with a first time stroke(s) were identifed over an 8 year period. Of these, 159 had first time post-stroke seizures and SE was recognised in 31 cases, and was the first presentation of epilepsy in 17, occurring within 14 days of the stroke. In four cases 
the stroke occurred simultaneously with SE, and in the 
remaining 10 cases, SE developed after one or more seizures. After follow-up of 47 months, 48.3% (15) had died, of which five deaths were directly attributable to 
SE. Additional seizures occurred in over half (8) of the 
initial SE cases and all 14 patients with SE occurring af -
ter one or more seizures. The study concluded that SE in stroke has a poor prognosis but that inital SE as a first epileptic symptom was not predictive of developing 
subsequent seizures [13].
In the US Nationwide Inpatient Sample study cov -
ering an eight year period, 718,531 hospitalisations 
with acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) were identified of whom generalised convulsive SE (GCSE) developed in  Table 3: Approximate frequency and mortality of SE in different aetiologies

Epileptologie 2017; 34 The Mortality of Status Epilepticus | A. Neligan1,415 (0.2%). 102,763 were admitted with intra-cranial 
haemorrhage (ICH) of whom GCSE developed in 266 (0.3%). In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in 
those with GCSE and AIS or ICH, particularily if analysis 
was restricted to patients with length of stay greater then one day (AIS: 28.4% vs 9.2%, p<.01; ICH: 30.1% vs 24.3%, p=0.03). Other markers of morbidity like pneu-monia, need for mechanical ventilation, tracheotomy 
and length of stay > seven days were all statistically as-
sociated with concomittant SE [14]. 
In the Hessen study [7], long-term mortality rate in 
patients with a first episode of cerebrovascular-related 
SE was 57% compared to 48% in people with acute 
stroke without SE, suggesting a synergistic effect be-tween SE and stroke resulting in greater morbidity and mortality. Multivariate analysis indicated that patients with status epilepticus had, after 6 months, twice the 
risk of death compared with patients with stroke with -
out SE (hazard ratio of 2.12, CI 1.04-4.32, p=0.0392) [7]. 
This potential synergistic effect between cerbrovas-
cular disease and SE was investigated in a prospective 
cohort study of 83 patients with SE and stroke (44 with 
acute and 39 with remote stroke) and compared them 
to 159 controls (acute stroke only). Acute stroke and SE had a mortality of 39%, representing an almost three-fold increase compared to those with acute stroke only (14%) or those with SE and remote stroke (5%), (p < 
0.001). In addition there was almost an eight-fold dif -
ference in mortality between the acute stroke and SE 
group and the remote stroke and SE group. This differ -
ence was not accounted for by age, sex or radiographic 
lesion size. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated a 
statistically significant synergistic effect of combined injuries of cerebral vascular ischaemia and SE [15].  
In a large US study on mortality rates in SE using 
hospital admission and discharge coding data, cerebro-
vascular disease was a predictor of in-hospital mortal-
ity with an odds ratio of 2.08 (CI 1.13-3.82) and a mor -
tality rate of 22% (p < 0.0001) and also for the need for mechanical ventilation (p < 0.0001) [16]. 
The relative frequencies of the major aetiologies and 
their associated mortality rates are shown in Table 3. 
SE and antiepileptic drug reduction or withdrawal 
or low antiepileptic drug levels 
In patients with a prior diagnosis of epilepsy, non-
compliance with anti-epileptic medication (AEDs) is of -
ten postulated as being the most common cause of SE. 
Whilst this may be true in adults, it is not the case in 
children. In the NLSTEPSS [10], only one case of SE was attributable to low antiepileptic drug concentrations, although low serum levels of AEDs were the cause in 21% of cases in children in the Richmond study [4]. 
In a retrospective review of all admissions with sta-
tus epilepticus to a single institution in San Franscico in the 1980s, 25% of cases of status epileptius identi-fied were related to withdrawal of AEDs, with 90% of patients having a good outcome (defined as unchanged from baseline, or mild neurologic deficits that allowed 
independent living) such that the authors conclude  
“ ... that patients with a history of epilepsy who de-
velop SE because of anti-convulsant drug withdrawal or break-through seizures can be expected to respond well to acute anticonvulsants.” [17].
In a study of 83 episodes of SE from Berlin, low lev -
els of AEDs were the primary cause of the SE in 27.7% of the non-refractory cases but no refractory cases (p < 0.001) allowing the authors to conclude that “SE caused by insufficient levels of AEDs is usually not re-
fractory” [18]. 
Alcohol, substance abuse and drug-induced SE
 Alcohol abuse (intoxication or withdrawal) has 
been found to be a common cause of SE in many popu-
lation-based and hospital-based studies,with a report -
ed range of 8.1-25%, although alcohol was not reported to be a major cause in some studies such as the Min -
nesota [5] and EPISTAR [6] studies. Cases of alcohol-re-lated SE are generally associated with a favorable out -
come with most studies reporting a mortality rate of 0 
- 10% (9.6% in the California study) [9].
In a study of all 249 cases of GCSE in adults admit -
ted to a single centre over a 12 year period, 27 cases 
(10.8%) were identified in whom alcohol abuse was 
the only identifiable precipitating cause. In 12 (44%), 
SE was the initial presentation of alcohol-related sei-zures. 22 (81.5%) had returned to baseline at the time of discharge although time to gross recovery of men -
tal status was ≥ 12 hours in 24 of the 27 patients. Four 
(14.8%) had new neurological deficits at the time of 
discharge. The only death (3.7%) occurred in a 60 year old in whom status epilepticus continued despite four hours of treatment [19].
 Drug toxicity or abuse is generally a more com -
mon cause of SE in hospital-based studies compared to population-based studies, and the relative frequency and mortality rate varies markedly between different studies, with reported rates of 2 - 14% of cases. Cocaine (43%) and theophylline (21%) were the most commonly 
implicated drugs in the San Francisco study [17]. 
 
Severe acute cerebral anoxia/hypoxia and SE
 Anoxia, usually after cardiac arrest in adults, can 
result in deep coma with myoclonic jerking, and this is 
assumed by some authorities, but not all, to be a form 
of “SE” [1]. This dichothomy of opinion is evident by 
the fact that post-anoxic SE cases were excluded from the EPISTAR study [6]. In the population based studies, 158
Epileptologie 2017; 34 The Mortality of Status Epilepticus | A. Neliganhypoxia is the cause of SE in 8 - 13% of cases with an 
associated mortality typically in the range of 60 - 80% but others have reported mortality rates of up to 100% 
albeit in small sample studies.
In a study of 166 postanoxic survivors of cardiac ar -
rest treated with hypothermia, postanoxic SE was pre-
sent in 24% with a mortality rate of 80% compared to the overall mortality rate of 71% (p < 0.001). Post-an -
oxic SE was associated with a higher mortality regard-less of the type of acute cardiac rhythm or hypothermia treatment [20].
In the large US study of mortality in convulsive SE 
hypoxia-ischaemic brain injury-associated SE was the strongest predictor of mortality with an odds ratio of 9.85 (CI 6.63-14.6) and a mortality rate of 69% and was a significant risk factor for the need for mechanical ven -
tilation (p < 0.0001) [16]. 
CNS infections, encephalitis and status epilepti-
cus
Acute CNS infections and encephalitis are an impor -
tant cause of SE particularly in chidren, typically account -
ing for about 1 - 12% of all cases in various series from 
the developed world. In the California study, acute CNS infection was the cause of SE in 0.6% of cases with a me
-
dian age of 42 years and a mortality rate of 32.6% [9]. In the NLSTEPSS [10] 6% (11) of children had acute bacterial meningitis and 4% (7) a viral CNS infection. Moreover 3 of 
the 7 children who died had acute bacte
rial meningitis. 
In a retrospective study of all admissions to a paedi-
atric ICU in Montréal over a 10-year period, there were 147 admissions with SE of which 20 (13.6%) were due 
to bacterial meningitis and 20 (13.6%) due to encepha-litis, both of which were associated with high morbidity and mortality [16]. 
Population-based studies tend to show a rather 
more favorable outcome, with a lower frequency of refractory cases. In the California Encephalitis Project (CEP), a project aimed at determining the cause of en -
cephalitis, all patients identified with encephalitis were 
subdivided into 3 categories: refractory SE (defined as 
SE requiring anesthetic coma for management (Group I); Non-refractory SE (Group II);  and patients without seizures (Group III). 4% had refractory SE, 40% non-refractory SE and 56% no seizures. Cases of refractory 
SE associated with encephalitis tended to be younger 
(median age = 10) and had a poor outcome with 28% dying within 2 years and 56% neurologically impaired or undergoing rehabilitation [22].Other causes of status epilepticus 
Brain tumours are an uncommon cause of SE, repre-
senting 2 - 5% of cases in most studies although 12% of cases of SE in the Hessen study. The associated mortal-
ity rates are 0 - 36%. 
Trauma is also an uncommon cause of SE, typically 
accounting for between 0 - 10% of cases in the ma-
jor studies with an associated mortality of up to 20%  
(Table 3). 
Metabolic disorders are the cause of status epilep -
ticus in 2  -15% of cases in reported series with an as-soci
ated mortality rate of up to 31%. In the San Fransisco 
Study [17], 4% of cases were due to metabolic causes, 50% of whom failed to respond to 1st-line treatments 
and were associated with poor outcome (severe neuro
-
logic deficit requiring full supportive care or death) in 
65%. Acute metabolic disturbance (electrolyteimbal -
ance, hypoglycaemia, hypocalcaemia) was the aetiology of SE in approximately 3% of children in NLSTEPSS [10]. 
Moreover patients with metabolic disorders in the 
US hospital mortality study, presenting with GCSE were significantly more likely to require mechanical venti-
lation (p < 0.0001) with a 3-fold increase in mortality 
for those requiring mechanical ventilation compared to those who did not (7.43% vs 2.22%, odds ratio 2.79) [16]. 
Cryptogenic SE/Non-onset refractory SE
Despite investigations, the aetiology of SE remains 
undetermined in many cases. In the Richmond study [4], approximately 5% of cases were classified as idi-
opathic with a mortality rate of 22%. In the Minne-
sota study [5] 17.5% of cases of SE were classified as idiopathic/cryptogenic while the aetiology of SE was unknown in 13 (8.7%), one (7.7%) of whom died in the Hessen study [7]. 
In a retrospective review of all cases of unprovoked 
seizure and status epilepticus in Richmond over a 30 year period, 291 people with a first brief unprovoked seizure and 16 with SE, there were 5 deaths (all aged 
> 65) in those with SE. Compared with people with sei-
zure, the adjusted relative risk for death in those with SE was 2.4 over 10 years. This risk was more marked among those aged > 65 years (RR=5.1, CI 1.6-15.7) and for those with SE who later developed epilepsy (5/16, 
31.3%) (RR=6.3, CI 1.5-26.0). The standardised mortality 
ratio (SMR) for SE was 2.6 (CI 0.8-5.3) [23]. 
There has been an attempt in recent years to define 
a new syndrome, NORSE (new-onset refractor which is nevertheless of questionable clinical utility. All cases 
described occured in young adults in previous good 
health with an antecedent febrile illness. In a recent retrospective review of 130 cases of new onset refrac-tory status epilepticus from 13 academic US centres, 52% (67) remained cryptogenic with the common iden -159
Epileptologie 2017; 34 The Mortality of Status Epilepticus | A. Neligantified aetiologies being  autoimmune (19%) and para-
neoplastic (18%) encephalitis. Overall 77 (62% of 125) had a poor outcome of whom 28 (22%) died [24]. 
Other prognostic factors
 In addition to aetiology, other prognostic factors 
include age, duration of SE at presentation, level of 
consciousness, EEG findings, type of SE, prior history of 
epilepsy and comorbidities. Apart from aetiology, in -
creasing age and longer duration of SE are associated with a higher mortality rate [25] although the negative predictive effect of the duration of SE appears to lessen 
the longer it persists (> 10 hours) [26]. This in turn re-
flects the poorer prognosis with the later stages of SE, in particular refractory status epilepticus (requiring an -
aesthetic intervention) and super refractory status epi-
lepticus (SE of > 24 hours duration despite anaesthetic 
drugs). A combination of the above factors is used in the two most widely utilised SE prognostic scales: the SE severity score (STESS) (level of consciousness, type of SE, age and past history of epilepsy) [27] and the Epide-
miology-Based Mortality Score in SE (EMSE) (aetiology, 
age, comorbidities and EEG findings) [28]. 
Has status epilepticus mortality changed over 
time?
With the advent of increasing treatment options, 
establishment of treatment protocols for the acute 
management of SE and the advocacy of earlier and 
more aggressive intervention in the management of 
prolonged seizures (which is the rationale for the re-cently proposed definition of SE [29], raises the im -
portant question whether the mortality rate of SE has changed over time. There are however a very limited 
number of studies that allow for such an analysis.  
In the Californian study [9] the incidence and mor -
tality of SE was examined from 1991 through to 1998 
using a state-wide database of all people with a hos-
pital diagnosis of SE [7]. The overall case fatality was 
10.7%, but with a much lower rate of 3.5% for those admitted with a primary diagnosis of generalised con -
vulsive SE. Whilst the overall mortality for SE remained stable over the period of observation, the mortality 
of those admitted with a primary diagnosis of SE de-
creased from 4.7 to 3,2%. At the same time the annual incidence of SE decreased by 42% between 1991 and 1998 from 8.5 to 4.9/100,000 (p < 0.001) possibly sug-gesting more efficient and aggressive treatment of out 
of hospital prolonged seizures and SE [9].
Two more recent studies have looked at trends in 
SE-related hospital admissions and mortality in the 
United States, using representative samples of hospi-tals from national databases [30, 31]. In one study data 
from the US National Hospital Discharge Survey was used to identify hospital discharges with SE between 1979 and 2010 [30]. In total 760,117 discharges with SE 
were identified over the 32 years. In that time the in -
cidence of SE increased from 3.5/100,000/year in 1979 to 12.5/100,000/year in 2010, representing an overall increase of 12.5% per year, with the most significant 
increase occurring between 1979 and 1991 (17.7% an -
nual increase). There was a subsequent decrease in the 
incidence of SE in the 1990s before a further increase in the 2000s. The corresponding cumulative in-hospital mortality was 9.2% (95% CI 9.1,9.2) with no significant 
observed variation over the 32 years.
The second study utilised the Healthcare Cost and 
Utilisation Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample data to 
identify SE hospital admissions and SE associated mor -
tality between 1999 and 2010 [31]. When considered as 
the primary cause of death, the age-adjusted mortality 
rate for SE increased by 5.6% between 1999 and 2010 from 0.179 per 100,000 to 0.189 per 100,000, with a corresponding increase of 56.4% in age-standardised 
SE hospital admissions from 8.86 per 100000 in 1999 to 
13.86 per 100,000 in 2010 [31].
A more recent study looked at SE (and epilepsy) 
mortality rates in England and Wales between 2001 and 2013, which suggested a fall in SE mortality rates 
by 44% over the period of observation although such a 
finding needs to be cautiously interpreted as the mor -
tality rates were presented without the corresponding SE incidence rates [32].   
Conclusions
 Whilst SE accounts for only about 10% of epilepsy 
rated deaths, it is nevertheless associated with signifi-
cant morbidity and mortality. The overall mortality rate 
is about 10% with the SE aetiology being the primary prognostic factor, whilst age, SE duration, SE type and EEG findings are also of importance. There is conflict -
ing evidence as to whether SE mortality rates have 
changed over time and this merits further study.
