Abstract:  The effectiveness of five plant oils (cottons eed, olive, canola sunflower and used cooking 
oil) for the removal of dye from textile wastewater was evaluated. The study revealed that the dye 
removal efficiency increased as the temperature was increased. Under low pH, both the oil and dye 
split into two components each. Neith er one of the oil components join ed with either one of the dye 
components. However, the observed reduction in  the absorbance under aci dic conditions can be 
attributed to the dye components losing some of thei r original color or producing different colors that 
were not effectively measured at 475 nm. When the dye solution was shaken with the oil under alkaline conditions, it formed a colloidal solution containing the oil plus the dye, resulting in a significant dye removal from solution. The results also showed that the optimum conditions for the dye 
removal for various oils were at a pH of 13 and a temperature of 55 °C, except for canola oil that 
produced the highest dye removal efficiency at pH of 7. The used cooking oil achieved the highest dye removal efficiency (95.45%) followed by olive oil (87.00%). The other oils (cottonseed, canola and 
sunflower achieved dye removal effi ciencies below 58% and are, th erefore, not recommended for dye 
removal.

INTRODUCTION 
 
 Reactive dyes are the principal dyes used in the 
cotton industry which makes up 50% of the world’s fiber consumption
[1]. They  are commonly used in the 
textile industry because of their bright colours, excellent colourfastness and ease of application
[2,3]. A 
large number of reactive dyes are azo compounds that 
are linked by an azo group[4]. Many reactive dyes are 
toxic to some organisms and may cause direct 
destruction of aquatic life due to the presence of 
aromatic and metal chlorides[5]. It has been reported that 
some azo dyes are able to produce carcinogenic 
aromatic amines in the process of reductive 
degradation[6,7]. Their high solubility, synthetic origin 
and complex aromatic molecular structure make their 
removal a very difficult task[8,9]. 
 Methods for treating textile dye wastewaters consist of various chemical, physical and biological processes. These include: adsorption
[10], 
nanofiltration[11,12], colloidal gas aphrons[13], ultrasonic 
decomposition[14], electro coagulation[15], coagulation 
and precipitation[16], advanced chemical oxidation[17], electrochemical oxidation[18-19], photooxidation[18], pre-
dispersed solvent extraction[20], ozonation[21-24], 
supported liquid membrane[2, 25, 26], liquid- liquid 
extraction[25,27] and aerobic and anaerobic biological 
processes[28,29]. The advantages and disadvantages of 
some methods of dye removal from wastewater are given in Table 1.  The liquid membrane technique known as 
‘‘Supported Liquid Membrane’’ (SLM) has the 
advantage of achieving selective removal and concentration in single stage, thus having great 
potential for reducing cost significantly
[2]. SLM system 
has several advantages including: (a) low capital 
investment and operating cost, (b) low energy 
consumption, (c) minimal loss of extractant, (d) low 
liquid membrane requirement and thus less amount of expensive extractants which offer good selectivity and 
(e) simple to operate and easy to scale up. There have 
been a number of studies dealing with organic compound transport through SLM in synthetic 
solutions
[27]. However, no work has been carried out on 
the use of liquid membrane technology to recover 
textile dyes.

 The aim of this study was to investigate the 
potential of using renewal, non-toxic, natural plant oils 
as a liquid membrane for the removal of the dye remazal brilliant blue from the textile wastewater. The 
specific objectives were: (a) to evaluate the 
effectiveness of five oils (cottonseed oil, olive oil, canola oil, sunflower oil and used cooking oil) for 
removal of the textile dye remazol brilliant blue and (b) 
to investigate the effects of  pH and temperature on the 
dye removal efficiency.  
  
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
Oils:  Four types of commercia lly available plant oils 
(cottonseed oil, olive oil, canola oil and sunflower oil) 
were purchased from a local supermarket in Halifax. 
Used cooking oil was obtained from a local restaurant in Halifax. Some properties of these oils are shown in 
Table 2. The viscosity of the fresh oil was given by the 
manufactories, while the viscosity of cooked oil was measured using Bohlin VOR Rheometer (Bohlin 
Instroments, Cranbooy N.J., USA).

Reagents:  The chemicals used in  this study included 
sodium hydroxide (NaOH), sulphuric acid (H 2SO 4) and 
remazol Brilliant blue dye (1-amino-4-[4-(1-sulfonyl-
ethyl-2- sulfoxy)]-2-(9, 10-anthraquinone)-sulfonic 
acid; disodium salt,). The 98.6% NaOH and 98% H
2SO 4 were obtained from Fisher Scientific (Ca # S 
318-3 and Ca #A 300 212, Fisher Scientific, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). The remazol brilliant blue ,dye content ~ 50% was obtained from Sigma (R8001, Ca # 
22-324-7, Sigma, Oakville, Ontario, Canada).  
 
Standard curve: To determine the concentration of the 
remazol brilliant blue dye using colorimetric 
techniques, a standard curve was developed from the standard solution of remazol brilliant blue dye according to the procedur e described by Mahmoud et 
al.
[36]. The standard solution wa s prepared by dissolving 
0.1 g of the dye in 1000 mL of distilled deionized water at ambient conditions (pH of 7 and a temperature of 25 
˚C). Then, a set of 9 solutions with remazol blue dye 
concentrations of 10, 20, 30, 40 , 50, 60, 70, 80 and 100 mg/L was prepared. Finally , the absorbance of the 
prepared solutions was measured (in triplicate) using a spectrophotometer (Spectronic 601, Fisher scientific, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). The absorbance was then plotted against the known remazol blue dye concentrations (mg/L) as shown in Fig. 1. A blank sample was used to zero the spectrophotometer.  Experimental design:  The effects of oil type, pH and 
temperature on the removal of remazol brilliant blue from textile wastewater were investigated. Five types of 
plant oil (cottonseed oil, olive oil, canola oil, sunflower oil and used cooking oil), five levels of pH (1, 4,7,10 and 13) and five temperatures (15, 25, 35, 45 and 55 °C) were investigated. The experiments were designed as 5
3 factorials with 3 replicates. This resulted 
in 375 treatments. 
 Experimental procedure:  A volume of 500 mL of 
each of the five solutions (pH = 1,4,7,10 or 13) was 
prepared according to the procedure described by 
Mahmoud et al .[36]. A water bath (280, Precision 
Scientific, Winchester, VA, USA) was used to maintain a constant temperature of these solutions. Three replicates were prepared for each pH solution by 
placing 100 mL of the solution in a 200 mL Erlenmeyer 
flask. The water bath temperature was maintained at 
15°C. When the temperature reached a constant value, 
the flasks were placed in the water bath until the 
temperature of the solutions reached the desired 
temperature (one hour was needed). An amount of 0.03 
g of the dye was added to each flask. The flasks were kept in the water bath for additional 15 minutes. The 
absorbance of the dye solu tion was measured using a 
spectrophotometer (Spectronic 601, Fisher scientific, 
Montreal, Quebec, Canada) at 475 nm. Then, 6 mL of 
the dye solution was taken from each flask and placed 
into fiften 20 mL test tubes (3 replicates for each pH). Then, 6 mL of the oil was added to each test tube and 
mixed well with the dye solution for 2 minutes using a 
vortexer (Model number: M16715, Barnstead, Dubuque, Iowa 52001 USA). The test tubes were then 
placed in the water bath un til the temperature of the 
solution reached the desired temperature and complete 
separation between the oil and the solution occurred. 
The absorbance of the dye solution in bottom layer of 
each test tube was measured using the 
spectrophotometer at 475 nm . The same procedure was 
used for all the oil types studied and the entire process 
was repeated with the other temperatures investigated 
(25,35,45 and 55°C).  
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
  The effects of temperature and pH on the dye removal efficiency of different oils are shown in Table 
3 and presented in Fig. 2-6. Analysis of variance was 
performed on the dye removal efficiency data using the SAS system (5 
th ed, SAS, lastitrote inc, cery, North 
Carolina) as shown in Table 4. Duncan’s multiple range test was also performed on the data in order to test the differences among the levels of each factor as shown in 
Table 5. The results showed that the type of oil, pH and temperature had significant effects on removal efficiency of the dye (P=0 .0001). There were also 
significant interactions between the parameters (P=0.0001). The effect of pH was more pronounced than the type of oil and temperature and the five levels 
of pH were significantly different from one another at 
the 95% confidence level.

Effect of oil type on dye removal efficiency:  Removal 
of hazardous dyes from tex tile effluent is one of the 
important factors affecting the economic and 
environmental sustainability of the industry[37]. 
 Vegetable oils are non-hazardous, cheap chemicals 
that could be used a novel and environmentally-friendly 
liquid medium (LM) in a supported liquid membrane 
(SLM) dye removal system. These vegetable oils are naturally-occurring, easily-available and renewable 
sources
[26]. The results shown in Table 3 indicated that 
the used oil was the best suitable liquid membrane for 
removal of dye (95.45%) followed by the olive oil 
(87.00%). The other oils achieved little over 50% 
removal efficiency (58.08, 58.06 and 53.06% for cottonseed oil, sunflower oil and canola oil 
respectively). This higher removal efficiency of the 
used oil and olive oil may be due to their high viscosity (46.1 and 41.0 mPas for used and olive oils, 
respectively) as shown in Table 2. The other oils had a 
viscosity in the range of 30.3 – 33.5 mPas.  
 Muthuraman and Palanivelu
[38] reported that palm 
oil, sunflower and coconut oils are very suitable liquid 
membranes for transport of dye from aqueous feed 
solution (wastewater) to strip solution (H 2SO 4). The 
authors found no transport of dye when using castor oil 
as liquid medium due to its high viscosity which 
prevented the mass transfer. Using olive, gingerly, 
groundnut and mustard oils as a liquid membrane, there  0102030405060708090100

was a dye accumulation on the surface of the membrane 
during the transportation, so these LMs are skipped out 
for further studies. There was also no transport of dye without oil impregnation of the membrane suggesting 
the need for the hydrophobic oil for the transport of 
dye.  
 Venkateswaran and Palanivelu
[26] suggested that 
vegetable oils have the ability to dissolve phenolic 
substances because of thei r hydrophobic characters. 
The authors tested nine types of vegetable oils (castor, refined coconut, unrefined coconut, gingerly, 
groundnut, mustard, olive, palm and sunflower) for 
their efficiency in transporting phenol through supported liquid membranes (SLM). Among the tested 
oils, palm oil had the highest permeability 
(8.5 × 10
−6 m/s) whereas the castor oil had the lowest 
permeability (2.4 × 10−6 m/s). They concluded that 
palm oil had higher distribution coefficient than other oils used in the study.

that the dye removal efficiency increased as the 
temperature increased for all oils and at all pH levels. Generally, the effect of temperature on rates of chemical reaction is importa nt. Ordinarily, raising the 
temperature by 10 °C approxim ately doubles the rate of 
most but not all reactions. This is because the molecules are more likely to become sufficiently energy-rich to reach the required activation levels needed to undergo 
reactions by the increase in temperature
[25]. 
 The temperature of the medium has been shown to affect the dye removal process. Mittal et al.
[37] used de-
oiled soya as a waste for removal and recovery of malachite green from wastew ater and found increases 
in the removal efficiency wi th increases in temperature 
(from 30 to 50°C).  
 Al-Qodah et al .
[39] reported on the effect of 
temperature on the adsorptio n process. Increasing the 
temperature is known to increase the rate of diffusion of 
the adsorbate molecules acr oss the external boundary 
layer and in the internal pores of the adsorbent particle, 
owing   to   the    decrease   in   the  v iscosity of the dye

equilibrium capacity of the adsorbent for a particular 
adsorbate. The authors report ed an increase in the mass 
transfer coefficient (from 2×10−6 to 4.2×10−6 m/s) and 
in the diffusion coefficient (from 0.9×10−10 to 1.2×10−10 
cm2/s) as the temperature increased from 20 to 45°C.  
 Tsatsaroni[40] studied the degradation of azo 
disperse dye at high temperature 125°C using dye dispersions of 0.004, 0.02 and 0.1% dye concentration in buffer solutions of pH 4, 7 and 9. The result showed 
that the color change from yellow in nonpolar solvents 
(toluene, chlorobenzene) to greenish blue in polar 
solvents (acetone, ethanol), due to dealkylation of the 
amino group of the coupler, followed by oxidation of 
the amino group and nucleophilic substitution of the 
resultant moiety by a hydroxy group in the strongly 
alkaline medium due to the high temperature.

22H16N2Na2O11S3. Remazol brilliant blue R is an 
aromatic compound containing anthraquinone and 
amino, sulfonyl, ethyl, sulfoxy groups and sulfonic acid 
disodium salt[41]. The plant oil is a complex mixture of 
chemically distinct components, with triglycerides 
consisting of various fatty acids (palmitic acid, lauric, 
caprylic, capric, eruic acids) as major constituents[42]. 
 
Acidic condition:  Under acidic conditions (low pH), 
the hydrogen ion (H+) in the medium is attracted to the 
polar end of the triglycerides in plant oil structure making the outer part of each micelle positively 
charged. Then, this ioni c compound reacts with H
2O to 
produce a carbonium ion co mpound which then splits 
into a diglyceride plus on e free fatty acid releasing a 
hydrogen ion (H+) back to the medium as shown in Fig. 
8[43].  
 The hydrogen ion (H+) in the medium can then 
react with the amino group (NH 2) at carbon # 1 in the 
anthraquinone third ring of the remazol brilliant blue dye structure to from NH
3. This results in the formation 
of   the   ionic   form  of  the  dye  [C 22H17N2Na2O11S3] +

from NH 3+ in remazol brillent blue dye are released in 
the form of hydrogen gas (H 2), resulting in the transfer 
of the positive charge to NH  in carbon # 4[19]. This new 
ionic compound is also unstable so after and in 
presence of H 2O it splits into two components: one 
neutral compound containing the anthraquinone rings 
which is considered to be the chromophore (a part or 
moiety of a molecule responsible for its color) in the 
dye structure and the other compound carrying a positive charge at NH
3 which is located at carbon # 1’ 
in benzyl ring. This compound is an anilinium derivative [anilinium 3- (sulfonyl-ethyl-sulfoxy–sodium salt)] as shown in Fig. 9. Benelield et al .
[44] reported 
that the chromophore type in Remazol brilliant blue R is anthraquinone.  Dye molecules are used to impart color to materials 
and by doing so, become an integral part of the fabric. 
An aromatic ring structure coupled with a side chain is usually required for resonance and thus to impart color. 
Resonance structures are responsible for color as they 
can cause displacement or appearance of absorption 
bands in the visible spectrum of light. Correlation of a 
chemical structure with color has been accomplished in

by the following radicals, which form a basis for the 
chemical classification of dy es when coupled with the 
chromogen: azo (-N=N-); carbonyl (=C=0); carbon (=C=C=); carbon-nitrogen (>C=NH or -CH=N-): 
nitroso (-NO or N-OH): nitro (-NO
2 or =NO-OH): and 
sulfur (>C=S and other carbon-sulfur groups). The 
chromogen-chromophore structure is often not 
sufficient to impart   solubility and cause adherence of 
the dye to fiber. The auxoch rome or bonding affinity 
groups are amine, hydroxyl, carboxyl and sulfonic 
radicals, or their derivativ es. These auxochromes are 
important in the use classification of dyes[45]. 
 Under the low pH conditions used in our study, neither one of the oil components joined with the dye 
components. However, the observed reduction in the absorbance can be explained as a result of the splitting of the dye into two components that may have either 
lost some of their original color or had different colors 
that could not be effectivel y measured at the 475 nm 
wave length. 
 
Alkaline condition:  Under alkaline condition (high 
pH), the dye loses one hydrogen ion (H
+) from carbon # 
7′ which reacts with a hydroxyl group (OH-) from the 
alkaline media to form water (H 2O). This results in the 
transformation of the neutral compound to an ionic 
form having a negative charge at carbon # 7 ′ 
[C22H15N2Na2O11S3] -. Electrons are then transferred 
from the adjacent sulfonyl  group to carbon # 7 ′ 
resulting in a structure that has a sulfur carbon double

 Although plant oils may hydrolyze slowly in alkali 
media[43], this reaction does not  take place within the 
time frame of these experiments. The molecules of the oil (which remained neutral) were attached to the ionic 
form of the dye in the pres ence of water. When the dye 
solution was shaken with oil, it formed a colloidal solution containing the oil plus all the dye structure as shown in Fig. 11.   
Optimum removal conditions:  The optimum 
conditions for the removal of dye for various oils are shown in Table 6. Most oils produced the highest 
removal efficiency at a pH of 13 and a temperature of 55 °C except canola oil which produced the highest dye

removal efficiency at a pH of 7. The results also 
showed that the used cooking oil achieved the highest dye removal efficiency (95.45%) followed by olive oil 
(87.00%). The other oils (cottonseed, canola and 
sunflower achieved dye rem oval efficiencies below 
58% and are, therefore, not recommended for dye 
removal. The removal efficien cy was correlated to the 
viscosity of the oil (Table 2) as shown in Fig. 12. Viscosity has been used to assess chemical charges and 
characterize fluid textures.
 In vegetable oils[47], 
viscosity increases with the chain length of triglyceride 
fatty acids and decreases with the unstauration. It is a function of molecules’ dimension and orientation
[48] . 
Santose et al .[35] reported that after exposing oil to 
temperature typically used in frying, the viscosity of the oil increases with frying time. This has been attributed to oxidation and polymerization reactions and the 
thermal degradation of the oil   
 
CONCLUSION 
  Dye removal from textile wastewater was achieved using plant oils (cottonseed, olive, canola sunflower 
and used cokking oil). The study revealed that the dye 
removal efficiency increased as the temperature of the 
medium increased. Under low pH, both the oil and dye 
split into two components ea ch. The dye split into: one 
compound carrying a positive charge at NH
3 which is 
located at carbon # 1’ on the benzyl ring as chromogen and the other compound containing the anthraquinone 
rings which is considered to be the chromophore in the dye structure. The oil split into: diglyceride , free fatty 
acid and hydrogen ion. Neither one of the oil 
components joined with either one of the dye components. The observed reduction in the absorbance 
under acidic conditions can be explained as a result of 
the dye components either losing some of their original 
color or producing different colors that could not be 
effectively measured at the 475 nm wave length. When the dye solution was shaken with the oil under alkaline 
conditions, it formed a colloidal solution containing the 
oil plus the dye, thereby resulting in a significant dye removal from the solution. The results also showed that 
the optimum conditions for the dye removal for various 
oils were a pH of 13 and a temperature of 55 °C, except for canola oil that produced the highest dye removal 
efficiency at pH of 7. The used cooking oil achieved the 
highest dye removal efficiency (95.45%) followed by olive oil (87.00%). The other oils (cottonseed, canola 
and sunflower achieved dye removal efficiencies below 
58% and are, therefore, not recommended for dye removal.
