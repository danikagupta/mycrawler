ABSTRACT  
Wastewater contains elements toxic to humans and the ecosystem discharge of domestic and industrial 
wastewater of surface or groundwater very dangerous to the environment. Therefore, treatment of any kind of 
wastewater to produce discharge of good quality is necessary. As such, choosing an effective treatment process is 
very important. Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) is modification of activated sludge process, which has been 
successfully used to treat municipal and industrial wastewater. SBR process due to its operational flexibility and 
excellent process control possibilities is being extensively used for treatment of wastewater. The process is applied 
to remove nutrients high biochemical oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demands, toxic material such as cyanid e, 
copper, chromium, lead, nickel, total dissolved solids etc. As the SBR process can be effectively automated, it is 
known to save  significant operating expenses and is able to achieve high effluent quality in a very short aeration 
time. The process advantages are single tank configuration, small foot print, easily expandable, simple operation 
and low capital costs. SBR process is ga ining immense popularity in the recent years and many researches and 
investigations have been conducted on this treatment technology.

INTRODUCTION   
A supply of clean water is an essential requirement for the establishment and maintenance of diverse human 
activities. Water resources provide valuable food through aquatic life and irrigation for agriculture production. However, 
liquid and solid wastes produced by human settlements and industrial activities pollute most of the water sources throughout 
the world. As the en vironmental discharge standards are getting more and more stringent, the traditional continuous flow -
based biological wastewater treatment process faces severe challenges. The sequencing batch reactor (SBR) technology is a 
modification of the much popular activated sludge process (ASP). Such a conversion of the continuous nature of the ASP -
based treatment process to a batch process as in SBR helps introduce various process flexibilities and alternatives in proces s 
controls and design so as to better achieve  the latest effluent discharge standards. The term SBR was orig inally coined by R.L. 
Irvine . Opposed to the common belief of SBR being a new technology, the SBR -like fill and draw processes were popular 
during 1914 –1920. The revival of interest in SBR tech nology in its present form occurred during the late 1950s and early 
1960s due to the improvement in technology related with aeration and process control. In its initial years, SBR technology 
was mainly used by small communities for sewage treatment and for  the treatment of high strength industrial wastes. Due to 
the design flexibility and better process control that can be achieved by the modern technology, the use of the SBR process 
has not been limited to the field of sewage treatment only; it has also fo und wide acceptance in biological treatment of 
industrial wastewater containing difficult -to-treat organic chemicals. As the SBR process can be effectively automated, it is 
known to save more than 60% of the operating expenses required for a conventional A SP and is able to achieve high effluent

 749 quality in a very short aeration time. In densely populated countries such as India and regions such as Europe, SBR is being 
considered as a preferable technology due to its low requirement of area as well as manpowe r for operation. The SBR process 
is often preferred over Continuous Flow Process (CFP) due to reduction in  energy  consumption  and  enhancement  in  the  
selective  pressures  for  BOD, nutrient removal, and control of filamentous bacteria. Due to these reasons, SBR process is 
gaining immense popularity in the recent years.  The  SBR  technology  has  been  undergoing several minor and  major 
modifications  over the  past  few  years  to  be  able  to effectively  treat the exponentially increasing number  of new pollutants 
in wastewater. This article provides an insight into the technology  as  well  as  reviews  the  recent  advances  in  the  d esign  
and application of SBR technology.  
 
The Process  
In an SBR process, all these unit processes take place within a single tank for their specific duration and 
intervals, sequentially spaced over a span of time. Thus, SBR provides in time the same treatment what the CFP 
provides in space. The SBR technology basically incorporates a fil l-and-draw type biological wastewater treatment 
process, functionally resembling to an activated sludge process. Depending on the scale of operation , the  SBR 
system, along with its variants and hybrids, may involve single  or multiple  tanks, each  of whi ch features five basic 
operating modes, namely, Fill, React, Settle, Draw, and Idle. Being a batch process, the time duration of each mode 
within a tank can be adjusted to meet the different treatment needs, such as low COD in the effluent, biological 
nutrient removal, etc.  
 
SBR  Operating Principles   
In its most basic form, the SBR system is a set of tanks that operate on a fill -and draw basis. Each tank in 
the SBR system is filled during a discrete period of time and then operated as a batch reactor. After desired treatment, 
the mixed liquor is allowed to settle and the clarified supernatant is then drawn from the tank. The cycle for each 
tank in a typical SBR is divided into five discrete periods: Fill, React, Settle, Draw and Idle . There are several types 
of Fill and React periods, which vary according to aeration and mixing procedures. Sludge wasting may take place 
near the end of React, or during Settle, Draw or Idle. Central to SBR design is the use of a single tank for multiple  
aspects of wastewater treatment. SBR operation for each tank for one cycle for the five discrete time periods of Fill, 
React, Settle, Draw, and Idle (Irvine and Ketchum, 2004).

 750 Fill
The influent to the tank may be either raw wastewater (screened and degritted) or primary effluent. It may 
be either pumped in or allowed to flow in by gravity. The feed volume is determined based on a number of factors 
including desired loading and detention time and expected settling characteristics of the organisms. The time of Fill 
depends upon the volume of each tank, the number of parallel tanks in operation, and the extent of  
diurnal variations in the wastewater flow rate. Virtually any aeration system ( e.g., diffused, floating 
mechanical, or jet) can be used. The ideal aeration system, however, must be able to provide both a range of mixing 
intensities, from zero to complete agitation, and the flexibility of mixing without aeration. Level sensing devices , or 
timers, or in -tank probes (e.g., for the measurement of either dissolved oxygen or ammonia nitrogen) can be used to 
switch the aerators and/or mixers on and off as desired.  
 
React  
Biological reactions, which were initiated during Fill, are completed during React. As in Fill, alternating 
conditions of low dissolved oxygen concentrations (e.g., Mixed React) and high dissolved oxygen concentrations 
(e.g. Aerated React) may be required. The liquid level remains at the maximum th roughout react, sludge wasting can 
take place during this period as a simple means for controlling the sludge age. By wasting during React, sludge is 
removed from the reactor as a means of maintaining or decreasing the volume of sludge in the reactor and d ecreases 
the solids volume. Time dedicated to react can be as high as 50% or more of total cycle time. The end of React may 
be dictated by a time specification (e.g. the time in React shall always be 1.5 h) or a level controller in an adjacent 
tank.  
 
Settle  
In the SBR, solids separation takes place under quiescent conditions  (i.e.,  without inflow or outflow) in a 
tank, which may have a volume more than ten times that of the secondary clarifier used for conventional conti nuous -
flow activated sludge plant. This major advantage in the clarification process results from the fact that the entire 
aeration tank serves as the clarifier during the period when no flow enters the tank. Because all of the biomass remains 
in the tank until some fraction must be wasted, there is no need for underflow hardware normally found in 
conventional clarifiers. By way of contrast, mixed liquor is continuously removed from continuous -flow activated -
sludge aeration tank and passed through the clari fiers only to have major portion of the sludge returned to the aeration 
tank.  
 
Draw  (Decant)  
The withdrawal mechanism may  take  one  of  several  forms,  including  a  pipe fixed at some 
predetermined level with the flow  regulated  by  an  automatic valve or  a  pump, or an adjustable or floating weir 
at or just beneath the liquid surface. In an y case, the withdrawal mechanism should be designed and operated in a 
manner the prevents floating matter from being discharged. The time dedicated to draw  can range from 5 to more 
than 30 % of the total cycle time. The time in Draw, however, should not be overly extended because of possible 
problems with rising sludge.  
 
Idle
The period between Draw and Fill is termed Idle. Despite  its name, this “idle” time can be used effectively 
to waste settled sludge.  While sludge wasting can be as infrequent as once every 2 to 3 months, more frequent sludge 
wasting programs are recommended to maintain process efficiency and sludge settling SB R technology has the 
advantage of being much more flexible than Conventional Activated Sludge Processes (CASP) in terms of matching 
reaction times to the concentration and degree of treatment required for a particular wastewater. For example, the 
SBR proce ss allows for the following adjustments to be made in addition to those (such as sludge age and operating 
mixed liquor solids concentration) that can be made in an equivalent conventional process: total cycle duration of 
each phase within the process cycle  pattern of inflow dissolved oxygen profile during aeration operating top water 
level operating bottom water level.

Advantages  
The primary advantages of the SBR process are:  
- Equalization, primary clarification (in most cases), biological treatment, and  secondary clarification  can 
be achieved in a single reactor vessel.  
- Small space requirements.  
- Common wall construction for rectangular tanks.  
- Easy expansion into modules.  
- Operating flexibility and control.  
- Controllable react time and perfect quiescent settling.  
- Elimination of return sludge pumping.  
- Potential capital cost savings  by eliminating clarifiers and other equipment.  
 
Disadvantages  
The primary disadvantages of the SBR process are:  
- A higher level of sophistication is required (compared to conventional systems), especially for larger 
systems, of timing units and controls.  
- Higher level of maintenance (compared to conventional systems) associated with more sophisticated 
controls, automated switches, and automated valves.  
- Potential of discharging floating or settled sludge during the D raw or Decant phase with som e SBR 
configurations.  
- Potential plugging of aeration devices during selected operating cycles, depending on the aeration system 
used by the manufacturer.  
- Potential requirement for equalization after the SBR, depending on the downstream processes.  
- Installed  aeration power based on percent toxic of the treatment time.  
- Batch feeding from storage or bios electors required to control bulking.

To accommodate continuous inflow of wastewater, the SBR system generally comprises either a 
storage/equalization tank and a single SBR tank or a minimum of two tanks. As with conventional activated sludge 
treatment systems, conventional screening and grit removal are usually provided as preliminary treatment. A 
primary sedimentation stage is not usually required with SBR processes unless the influent suspended solids are 
excessive. Settled sewage may also be treated if the SBR is installed downstream of exi sting primary settlement 
tanks. Reactors are usually simple circular, square or rectangular tanks and may be constructed from concrete or 
steel. Lagoon structures can also be used and existing tanks, for example, primary sedimentation tanks, can be 
retrofi tted.  Since the tank serves as an aeration tank and a final clarifier, fewer structures are used for the treatment 
plant as a whole and a more compact layout for the site can be  obtained. Extensions to the plant by the addition of 
modular basins using com mon wall construction can easily be designed for future loading conditions.  
The wasting of microorganisms is done once per cycle during the react phase in high yielding multiple 
tank system while the frequency of wasting may be as low as once every 2 weeks  for low yielding single tank 
operation. The simultaneous aeration, mixing, reaction, and settling occurring within the SBR tank obviate the 
requirement of a separate clarifier unit. The duration of Fill and React phases can be adjusted to impart the SBR 
system.  The SBR system provides major operational flexibilities like internal equalization and control of biological 
reactions through regulation of aeration. The presence of microorganisms in high concentrations right from the Fill 
phase reduces the treat ment duration significantly. The ability to control the substrate availability by varying the 
aeration duration during Fill provides a high degree of flexibility in controlling the filamentous organism population 
and concentration of nitrogen. Anoxic perio d during the React phase is useful in nitrogen removal from the system.  
 
Review of Related Literature  
The SBR technology is being applied in a large number of treatment processes owing to the operational 
flexibility it offers. The ability of  SBR to perform flow equalization, biological treatment, and secondary 
clarification within a single tank by varying the duration of each phase and aeration period makes it a versatile 
treatment technology. In the recent years, the combination of different  treatment technologies has been tested at lab 
scale to extend the application of SBR technology further. A variation of SBR is a sequencing batch bio film reactor 
(SBBR), which is a Combination of Suspended and Attached Growth (CSAG) system. Bio film grow s at a solid –
fluid interface by attachment to a support material. It provides a chance to slow growing microorganisms to 
proliferate, irrespective of the HRT, and sedimentation characteristics of the bio -aggregates. The selection of 
support material and it s size depend s on the characteristics of the wastewater and the treatment objectives. The

 753 reactor may be packed with the support material or it may be suspended in the reactor fluid. A typical SBBR cycle 
has Fill, React, and Draw phases only. Plug flow con ditions exist within an SBBR. The time required for washing 
of the support media may be considered analogous to the settling time in an SBR. Due to the excessive head loss 
and sloughing off risk, the SBBR systems are unsuitable for influent with high TSS a nd when excessive microbial 
growth is expected. There have been numbers of installations after the first pilot scale SBBR was used to treat leach 
ate from the Georgswerder landfill, Germany. The immobilization of microorganisms on a carrier media reduces 
the microbial washout, protects them from toxic constituents, pH, and temperature extremes. As the media is 
retained, a shorter HRT is possible that results in smaller reactor size or higher treatment capacity with the same 
size reactor compared to conventi onal SBR. Bio film configured systems are more resilient and are well suited for 
treating wastewater with highly variable quality with low sludge production. When chosen judiciously, the media 
may help absorb shock loads, for example, activated carbon for high organic load or zeolite for high ammonia in 
influent. These buffers temporarily absorb the shock load -causing constituent and later gradually desorb the 
pollutants along with their simultaneous or subsequent biodegradation. The powdered activated carb on (PAC) for 
treatment of raw landfill leach ate demonstrated better NH3 -N, color, and COD removal than conventional SBR. 
The use of intelligent dynamic control systems over the conventional time control system has shown to improve 
the COD, TP, and TN remo val efficiencies with considerable energy savings. A modified SBR system with bio -
floc technology (BFT) has found interesting application in aquaculture where protein feed for fish as well as 
treatment of wastewater are considered to be cost -inhibiting. Bi o-floc refers to a special kind of macro aggregate 
of microorganisms which are able to take up nitrogenous compounds present in wastewater and to conver t it to 
microbial protein. Bio -floc organisms can be used as food to the fishes. It has been shown at th e lab -scale that SBR 
envisaged as e xternal growth reactor for bio -floc was able to attain nitrogen removal efficiency of up to 98 % when 
an optimal C/N ratio between 10 and 15 was maintained. It has also been demonstrated that the BFT in SBR reactor 
also e nabled conversion of nitrogen in aquaculture suspended solids into bacterial biomass, which could potentially 
be used to feed fish, thereby increasing the efficiency of nitrogen —nearly reaching 100 % nitrate removal within 6 
h. SBR and SBBR were used to tr eat industrial wastewater containing phenolic compounds, such as p -nitrophenol 
(PNP) which is a hazardous chemical widely used in agricultural, pharmaceutical, and dye industries as a synthetic 
intermediate in the manufacturing process. Complete removal wa s demonstrated for PNP removal up to 350 mg/L 
influent concentration (loading rate of 0.368 kg/m3day−1) by SBR and SBBR (with polyethylene rings). However, 
the average NH3 -N removal efficiency for the SBR and SBBR was only slightly compromised; it reduced to 86 
and 96 %, respectively. SBR has been successfully applied for wastewater with high nitrogen content and low COD 
such as anaerobic SBR (ASBR) -based simultaneous partial nitrification, anaerobic ammonium oxidation, and 
denitrification (SNAD) system tha t was applied to treat the opto -electronic industrial wastewater with C/N ratio of 
nearly 0.2. A similar study was performed by for the treatment of wastewater from production of thin -film transistor 
liquid crystal display (TFT -LCD) which contained chemica ls like dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), monoethanolamine 
(MEA), and tetra -methyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH). Two different SBR systems, aerobic and anoxic/oxic 
(A/O), were used. Effective MEA degradation could be easily achieved under all three conditions examin ed, while 
efficient DMSO and TMAH degradation could be attained only under anaerobic and aerobic conditions, 
respectively. These days, hybrid systems like the Porous biomass carrier SBR (PBCSBR) are being investigated to 
achieve improved nutrient removal e fficiency using time -sequenced anoxic/oxic phases and high biomass [18]. In 
another study, a new biomass retention strategy using natural fibers as biofilm carriers was utilized to treat dairy 
manure. The concept, evaluated for treating flushed dairy manur e in a psychrophilic ASBR, showed higher methane 
yield despite short HRT (6 days) and low temperature. ASBRs are known to be capable of uncoupling HRT with 
SRT for biomass retention. Additionally, a particular sequence of operation of ASBR was used to exer t selection 
pressures on microbes for immobilization. Aerobic SBR process, coupled the photo -fenton process and reverse 
osmosis (RO), was used to reclaim wastewater from textile industry enabling complete internal reuse of water. SBR 
operating conditions s uch as cyclic feast and famine regimes, high shear stress, and short sett ling time promote 
formation of floc granules which are nothing but dense microbial consortia consisting of different bacterial species 
that perform different roles in degrading the co mplex wastes. Alternating anoxic/oxic condition combined with 
step-feeding mode (AASF) was proved to be an efficient method for nitrogen removal in Granular SBR (GSBR). 
Aerobic granular sludge presents several advantages over activated sludge, such as excellent settling properties, 
high biomass retention and biosorption, and ability to deal with high organic loading rates and to perform diverse 
biological proc esses simultaneously, such as COD, N, and P removal. The utility of aerobic granular sludge in SBR 
for degradation of toxic organ fluorine compounds such as 2 -fluorophenol (2 -FP) has been demonstrated. The 
fluoroaromatic compounds are usually biodegraded v ia halo -catechols. The maintenance of a good population of 
halo-aromatics degraders in bioreactors is highly desirable due to the low concentration discontinuous nature of © 2022 IJNRD | Volume 7, Issue 8  August 2022 | ISSN: 2456 -4184 | IJNRD.ORG

 754 these compounds. The GSBR provides high biomass retention and thus is extremely prom ising for the treatment of 
effluents containing toxic compounds. Conventional SBRs treating wastewaters with flocculating sludge can be 
converted to granular SBRs by reducing the settle time. A study with wastewater containing azo dyes attempting 
for simul taneous bio -decolorization and COD removal in SBR having a combination of anoxic -aerobic React phase 
revealed the following: (a) longer anoxic React phase promotes decolorization, while (b) COD removal was better 
with shorter anoxic phase. The granular -activated carbon -SBR (GAC -SBR) has shown promising results for the 
treatment of textile wastewater containing dyes where the dye was removed by GAC via physical adsorption 
mechanism. Addition of extraneous organic carbon increased the removal efficiency of di rect dye. In recent years, 
the presence of endocrine disruptor compounds (EDCs) in surface water, public water supplies as well as in 
wastewater has generated much public concern. EDCs are a group of different chemical substances that even in low 
concentra tions such as sub -μg/L level in water may interfere with the normal functioning of human endocrine 
system and animals. SBR process presents an attractive avenue for the removal of EDCs from wastewater due to 
its ability to provide anoxic/anaerobic/aerobic conditions within the same basin. Maintenance of such dynamic 
environmental conditions inside the SBR process tank provides ample scope for the microorganisms capable of 
degrading EDCs to utilize them. Longer SRT and HRT have been observed to cause greater  degree of removal of 
EDCs primarily because such conditions allow for the proper growth of the slow growing microorganisms capable 
of utilizing the EDCs. Table 2 summarizes brief details of some of the recent studies performed on the efficiencies 
of diffe rent SBR configurations for the removal of EDCs commonly occurring in wastewater. Ozonation and other 
polishing steps are suggested after proper study of final products in critical cases where significant dilution of STP 
effluent does not occur.

 756 EXPECTED OUTCOMES OF STUDY  
Wastewater treatment involves breakdown of complex organic compounds in the wastewater into simpler 
compounds that are stable and nuisance -free, either physico -chemically and/or by using micro -organisms 
(biological treatment). The adverse environmental imp act of allowing untreated wastewater to be discharged in 
groundwater or surface water bodies and or lands are as follows:  
 
1. The decomposition of the organic materials contained in wastewater can lead to the production of large 
quantities of m alodorous gases.  
2. Untreated wastewater (sewage) containing a large amount of organic matter, if discharged into a river/stream, 
will consume the dissolved oxygen for satisfying the Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) of wastewater and 
thus deplete the dissolved  oxygen of the stream, thereby causing aquatic species kills and other undesirable 
effects.  
3. Wastewater may also contain nutrients, which can stimulate the growth of aquatic plants and algal blooms, 
thus leading to eutrophication of the lakes and streams.  
4. Untreated wastewater usually contains numerous pathogenic, or disease causing microorganisms and toxic 
compounds, that dwell in the human intestinal tract or may be present in certain industrial waste. These may 
contaminate the land or the water body, wher e such sewage is disposed.  
 
CONCLUSION  
For the above -mentioned reasons the treatment and disposal of wastewater, is not only desirable but also 
necessary. Need for recycling of treated wastewater in many parts of the world has  necessitated the introduction of 
newer stringent standards for treated wastewater. Unlike the conventional wastewater treatment plants, SBR -based 
wastewater treatment plants can achieve better treated water quality with no or minor modification in the ins talled 
infrastructure, only by simple alteration of the process control parameters in one or more of the phases of the 
treatment cycle. The SBR process offers smaller foot -print area, lower investment cost, lower operation complexity, 
and significant contr ol performance as compared to conventional treatment process. If properly designed, the 
process may achieve significant degree of biological nutrient removal too. Although the SBR process is well 
developed, and different variants are continuously evolving,  there are issues that need to be addressed further.  
Ensuring process reliability for simultaneous N and P removal in SBR requires further work towards clear 
understanding of the microbial diversity of the system with an emphasis on its dynamics under diff erent changing 
process situations. The study and improved design may follow the principles of ecologically engineered processes 
that derive stability from the presence of multiple species that accumulate phosphorus (functional richness). This 
may make the system more resilient with each species showing differential sensitivity to variations in the 
environmental conditions such as temperature and pH swings, toxic pollutants, presence of nitrite and nitrate, 
prevalence of VFAs, etc.  
Appropriate process contro l is the heart of the SBR process as it important in ensuring removal of the 
target contaminants from the wastewater. PLC -based pre -programmed  control strategies are popular. Introduction 
of real -time control strategies can enable SBR process to achieve be tter robustness, reliability, and optimized 
operation. This will enhance energy efficiency and also shall help widen the areas of application of the SBR process. 
Future studies on SBR control strategies would include the development of intelligent control system, which is a 
real-time control strategy working on feedback -based control. This shall make the SBR process adaptive to 
changing environmental conditions and to varying wastewater quality so that optimum effluent quality is 
maintained with high degree  of reliability.
