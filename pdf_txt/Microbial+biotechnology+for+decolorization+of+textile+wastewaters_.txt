Abstract  
During textile processing, different waste materials are produced at different stages including dyes 
and wastewater. These chemicals and wa stewater are ultimately released into environment that 
negatively affects its biota because of detrimental changes brought into the surrounding by these 
unused and untreated materials. The major problems being imposed by textile industry include: 
excessive  usage of water, control of its frequent discharge into environment and treatment of this 
effluent loaded waste water. Industries are struggling to find out some novel solutions for treatment 
of these wastes to diminish the environmental damage being cause d by effluent discharge. In recent 
years, there is an increasing trend of using different kinds of microorgan isms for degradation 
purpose of  textile industries  effluents . Because of low cost and long lasting effect of biological 
remediation of industrial wastes, there has been an increasing demand for new and novel biological 
solutions for industrial effluent management.  In this context, this review summarize major textile 
dyes, different bioremediation ways by which textile dye effluents can be treated  and microbes 
capable of degradation and decolorization that can be applied in order to develop cost effective 
methods for textile effluents treatment . 
Keywords: Azo dyes; Decolorization; Microbial degradation; Textile effluents
Introduction  
Textile industry  is considered one of the 
largest industry when it comes to amount of 
chemicals being used and thus it is the major 
contributor of chemical pollution in our 
environment. Complex chemicals and water 
is extensively used in textile in dustry during 
textile pro cessing and untreat ed and unused 
leftover substances  are released as waste 
water. This wastewater is heavily loaded with 
complex chemical compounds thus making 
this wastewater high in pH , color and lethal  
compounds . The mixing of this untreated 
wastewater into fresh water resources  like 
ponds,  rivers, streams, canals  etc. is increasing water pollution  ultimately  
affecting the aquatic biota [1, 2]. Textile 
industry effl uents  are a  mixture of many 
polluting substances of complex chemical 
nature including  organ ochlorine -based 
pesticides  to heavy metals and these are 
mostly important parts of different types of 
dyes being used in  the dyeing process of 
fabrics [3]. 
Effective treatment of fabric industry 
discharge  has thus become  a major ecological 
problem . Becaus e it is very difficult to 
eradicate  dyes from textile waste discharge , 
there must be some proper treatment 
processes  for effluents to be released into the Sharif et al.  
2362  environment without affecting 
environmental health [4, 5]. In a broader 
sense, frequent  encounter with textile dye  
effluents is a potential health threat  and this 
has been reported to be direct or in direct 
cause of various health problems which 
include suppres sion of immunity system , 
autoimmune diseases, various complications 
of respiration, blood circula tion, damage to 
central nervous system and neur obehavioral 
disorders,  allergic reactions, different type of 
cancerous diseases, vomiting , copious  
diarrhea, tissue damage , eye skin disorders, 
eye infections,  lung related problems  are 
names to few [6]. 
 Now -a-days, growing trend toward the 
practice of using  microorganisms for 
environmentally  friendly treatment of textile 
effluents  has gain importance . Some 
microbes  are reported to have potential to 
break down  or absorb a large number of 
textile dyes effluent s [7, 8]. 
 In fact, some microorganisms which belong 
to different taxonomic groups such as 
different strains of bacteria, whit e rot fungi 
and algae also have  ability to break down  and 
decolorize various complex colored 
compounds that  otherwise are difficult  to 
remove from environment  [9]. 
It is well recognized fact  that under certain 
conditions, different bacterial strains have 
high capability to mineralize, decolorize and 
degrade different dyes  [10, 11].  Different 
bacteria l strains with  potentiality to 
disintegrate textile dyes have drawn the 
attention of scientific community and there 
has been a growing interest towar d this  [12]. 
Bacterial o xidoreduct ive enzymes which 
include laccas e, azoreductases etc. actively 
participate in dye decolorization  activity of  
bacteria  especially in  azo dye  color removal 
[13, 14]. Bacterial azo dye degradation  
involve s an electron donor and  sequence of 
enzymatic steps aided by azoreductase that 
catalyze the cleavage of azo linkages [15, 
16]. Therefore, it is possible to exploit the ability 
of bacterial azoreductase enz ymes to catalyze 
the azo bond c leavage in azo dye compounds  
for deve lopment of effective,  biodegradable  
methods for textile  effluent s management  
[17]. 
Different algal sp . (Chlorella sp . Oscillatoria 
sp.  etc) have  also been investigated  to check 
the efficiency of their azoreductase enzyme s 
for disintegration of textile based azo dyes . 
According to some studies, the algal azo 
reductases have been shown to produce 
aromatic amines by breaking down azo bond 
of azo dye co mpounds. In relation to this,  
there are some algae that can carry out the 
direct  degradation of azo dyes instead of 
converting them into aromatic compounds 
first [18]. 
Another eco -friendly approach to ward  bio-
degradation of  textile dyes is the application  
of lignin degrading  fungi and their enzym e 
complexes . Ligninolytic fungi contain  an 
enzymatic system composed  of three 
principal fungal enzymes: laccase, lignin 
peroxidase (LiP) and manganese p eroxidase 
(MnP) and this system of three enzymes  have 
been fou nd to impart degrad ative ability to 
ligninolytic fungi  [19, 20]. Textile industry 
waste water containing different types of 
dyes can  be treated efficiently before  its 
discharge  by white -rot fungi that can  
decolorize azo dyes  [21]. 
Lignin -degrading system ( LDS) of fungi has 
been reported f or effective degradation of 
variety  of industrial pollutants . The 
effectiveness of pollutant degradation 
depends upon two factors:   
1) Nature  of contaminant   
2) And the fungal sp.  carrying out  
degradation process es [22, 23]. 
The different microbial  enzyme systems like 
lignin degradation system of white rot fungi 
are being  explored extensively to study the 
characteristics of these enzymes and to check 
their suitability for the decomposition  of 
colored compounds  [24].  Pure Appl. Biol., 9( 4): 2361-2382 , December , 2020  
http://dx.d oi.org/10.19045/bspab.2020.90251  
2363  Enzyme s can be considered as biochemical 
mean for effective wastewater treatment. 
Both intracellular and ex tracellular  microbial 
enzymes can be utilized for treatment 
purposes.  
Enzymes are very efficient biological 
catalysts. These have the ability to  target a 
specific pollutant without any effect  on other 
components present in the effluent . Nor like 
fungi, the yeast can decolorize  the dyes and 
can survive even in hostile conditions  [25, 
26]. 
The biosorption or uptake of chemicals by 
microbial mass is also usefu l. Biomass from 
different microbes such as algae, yeast, 
filamentous fungi and bacteria are  reported  to 
eliminate d yes through  biosorption process  
[27].  
Textile industry effluents  
Dyes, pigments and aromatic  compounds are  
among some of most commonly used 
chemicals which have  numerous  textile  
industry  applications such as in dying, 
tanning of  leather and also for coloring  of 
different stuff being used in textile industries 
[27]. Different  chemical substances 
discharged  from the  textile  industries become 
a constant  environmental pollutant . Serious 
environmental problems arise due to 
untreated effluents being released from 
textile industry sometimes to such levels that 
can seriously threaten human health, aquatic 
biota, domesticated animals and livestock 
and l eave negative impacts on entire 
surroundings [28]. Out of 0.7 million tons 
dyes being produced in textile indust ry 
around the globe annually , it is assessed  that 
about 200,000 tons of these resistant 
compounds  are lost every year as effluent 
because of fau lty dying processes  [29, 30]. 
Unluckily  most of these  remain  in the 
environment because  of their high 
consistency against physical, chemical  and 
microbial degradation  and thus are continues 
threat  to environment or to flo ra and fauna 
[31]. Textile industry  dyes  
Due to coloring properties, different type of 
dyes and pigme nts are widely  used in textile  
industry as well as in other industries such as  
paper, plastics, leathers, and cosmetics 
industry . Large amount of water is used in 
textile processing that is  being released 
untreated into the environment [32]. Dye 
effluents are one of the main  pollutants 
carried  to the environment, mainly by textiles  
industries.  Classification of dyes depends 
upon their application s and chemical nature . 
There are two main comp onents of a dye, first 
a group of atoms that causes  dye color is 
known as  chromophores and second are  
elect ron withdrawing or donating 
constituents of chromophores, called 
auxochromes [33]. The most predominant  
examples of chromophores are azo ( –N=N –), 
carbonyl ( –C=O), methine ( –CH=), nitro ( –
NO2) and quinoid groups. The  examples of 
main  auxochromes are amine ( –NH3), 
carboxyl ( –COOH), sulfonate ( –SO3H) and 
hydroxyl ( –OH) groups . One the basis of 
their chemical properties, auxochromes can 
fit into the  follow ing dye classes ; reactive, 
direct, acid, basic, disperse, pigment, vat, 
anionic, Sulphur , solvent and disperse dye s 
[34]. Azo dyes dominate  with the maximum  
diversity  of colors and are usually considered 
as largest class of dyes owing to their 
coloring pr operties [35]. Azo, anthraquinone 
and phthalocyanine are three most commonly 
used dyes that have high toxicity and also 
carcinogenic properties  [11]. Because these 
are easy to manufacture, azo dye occupy 
approximately 80% of yearly  making of 
commercial dye s throughout the world.  Azo 
dyes (Table 1), as named on the basis of  one 
or more azo bond ( R1-N=N -R2) present in 
them , account for approximately 60-70% of 
all textile d yestuffs used in current era [36]. 
Beca use of their p oor absorbability to the 
fibers  and because of their constant  chemical 
nature, th eir removal is very difficult from  
waste water by the usual  treatments  [37]. Sharif et al.  
2364  Different types of dyes are  being  used in 
industries  these days . Fabrics having nitrogen 
such as  wool, polyamine and silk  are dyed b y 
acidic dyes which are cons idered as largest 
class of dyes [38]. Basically, there are three 
types of textile dyes (Table 2 ) that are  cationic, anionic and nonionic types. Anionic 
dyes commonly include acid, reactive and 
direct dy es.  Only one type of cationic dye 
being utilized  in textile industry  is basic dyes . 
Nonionic d yes which  do no t undergo 
ionization in solution  are disperse dyes [39].

One of the most extensively applied  dyes 
colorants  in fabric  industry are a zo dyes 
making up to  60±70% of all dyestuff , 
anthraquinone  group being on second in this 
list. Biological management  of azo dyes from 
effluents is highly effective and these dyes 
are soluble in solution . Highly degradation 
resistant dyes are the type of dy es known as 
reactive dyes that are present in effluents 
released from textile industry  [7]. Now -a-
days,  practice  of using green technologies 
mainly for the pur pose of protecting 
environment and for reducing environmental 
pollution  is gaining wide attentio n. Microbes  
are widely being used for treatment of 
industrial effluents  which have certain 
advantages. Some microbes being used for 
degradation are described below : 
Role of Bacteria in biodegradation  
Several  researchers  have studied  different 
bacterial spe cies for bioremediation  of dyes, 
metals, soils and waters  that are contaminated 
by textile effluents . Dyes that contain carcinogenic compounds , heavy metals,  
halogen containing compounds , bleaching  
agents containing  chlorine , formaldehyde  
etc. are some of the main pollutants of textile 
wastewater  [43, 44]  . Bacteria able to 
decolo rize dye  (Table 3 ) in pure cultures  have 
already been described  [45]. The m ixed 
microbial culture bears  more  benefits then 
the application of  pure cultures in the 
disintegration of  colorants being utilized  in 
textile industry . Dyes molecules may be 
directly attacked by d ifferent bacterial 
species  or some strains are even able to 
further degrade the  break down products that 
are formed  by another strain  [46]. 
The aerobic degradation of azo dye by 
bacteria  is not effective ; however, a group  of 
aerobic and anaerobi c bacteria has been 
shown  to degrade some  azo dyes  (Table 4 ). 
Pseudomonas leuteola  and Bacillus  subtilis 
are some of the bacteria being used  for 
anaerobic degradation  [51].

Microbial mechanism to degrade and decolorize 
azo dye  
Biological management  of textile industry dyes is 
an efficient and environmentally friendly process . 
The Microbial mechanism for  degradation and 
decolorization of most problematic textile dyes that 
are azo dyes involves  cleavage of azo bonds  in azo 
compounds, thus causing color  removal of azo 
compounds . Azo dyes  first undergo  reductive 
cleavage and then  resulti ng breakdown products 
which are  aromatic amines mainly are metabolized 
in the presence of oxygen.  Mostly, dyes are 
mineralized into simple inorganic compounds that 
are harmless for living organism and do not threat 
their life  [61].  
Microbial electron  transport  chain contains 
reduced flavin nucleotides for which azo dye 
in an oxidizing agent and is itself reduced 
during oxidation of flavin nucleotides and this 
process is followed by  the reduced fl avin 
nucleotides  undergoing reoxidation. This 
process usually  requires an  additional carbon 
source  for decolorization  and degradation to proceed at a feasible  speed  [62]. Some aerobic 
microbes utilize azo dyes as their only source 
of carbon and nitrogen, in others strains 
reduction of azo group can only be catalyzed  
by oxygen -tolerant azo reductases. This 
carbon is changed  to methane and carbon 
dioxide,  causing release of  electrons. These 
electrons then move down  electron transport 
chain to azo  dye, which is acting as electron 
acceptor . Then t here is reaction between  
electrons and azo  dye, leading to reduction of 
azo bonds, and thus  decolorization  occurs 
[63]. Several  other microbes  such as bacteria l 
strains , fungi , actinomycete s and algae are  
extensively been investigated  for their azo dye 
decolorization  capability  [63, 64]. 
Algal degradation and decolorization of 
textile dyes (Phycoremediation)  
Phycoremediation  may be defined  as the use 
of macro algae  or microalgae for the 
elimination  or biodegradation  of pollutants, 
including textile dyes  and xenobiotics from 
wastew ater with simultaneous  biomass Pure Appl. Biol., 9( 4): 2361-2382 , December , 2020  
http://dx.d oi.org/10.19045/bspab.2020.90251  
2367  propagation. There are  large number of  
processes for treating polluted water, 
industrial effluents, dyes, different colorants, 
bleaching and tanning  agents using 
microalgae aerobically as well as an 
anaerobically  [65]. Althou gh bacteria have  
pivotal importance in  degradation of 
environmental  pollutant s, microalgae have  
been shown to have organic pollutants 
degradation ability  (Table 5 ) besides 
providing oxygen for aerobic bacteria that 
can only degrade pollutants in the presen ce of 
oxygen . Indeed, there have been lots of 
studies proving that current environmental 
proble ms such as  textile industry effluents 
treatments issues can be resolved by using 
microalgae for degradation of pollutants into 
eco-friendly compounds [66]. Mutag enic and 
carcinogenic azo dyes and their intermediates  
compounds  are causing many health related 
issues  and are responsible for mutagenic 
activities in surface water  that are polluted  
largely  by textile waste water . Their release  
into surface water also le ads to  major  issues , causing obstruction of  light being unable to 
penetrate and also hinders oxygen access  into 
water bodies  [67, 68].  The algae are 
photoautotrophs and they require no carbon 
source. The utilization of algae for waste 
water treatment is a n efficient and cheap cost 
process .  The growth of photosynthetic algae 
is visible  even in the textile industry  effluents 
and therefore they are the possible  candidate 
for waste water treatment  [69]. 
Good color removal can be achieved by algal  
azo reductase enzyme s that is cap able of 
breaking down azo dyes. Chlorella  and 
Oscillatoria  species  have been shown to 
produce  aromatic  amines through 
degradation of azo dy es ultimately leading to 
formation of  simple organic compounds  
through further break down of these aromatic 
amines. Few other algal species  were even 
able to utilize  azo compounds (Table 6 ) as 
only carbon and nitrogen  source . Chlorella 
sp.  and Oscillatori a sp.  have been shown to 
degrade and decolorize more than 30  azo 
dyes into less complex  aromatic amines  [80].

Role of fungi in degradation and 
decolorization of textile dyes  
(Mycoremediation)  
The practical of  usage of  fungi for achieving 
bioremediation of polluted  soils and textile 
effluents  is termed as mycoremediation. 
Different problematic substances such as 
petroleum hydrocarbon compounds , 
polychlorinated biphenyls, heavy metals (by 
biosorption), phenolic derived compounds, 
degradation resistant  pesticides etc. have 
been reported to be degraded through 
mycoremediation. These h azard ous compounds are used by fungi as the nutrient 
source in this process of mycoremediation 
and changed them into simpler forms  also 
causing their decolorization ( Table 7 ). Fungi 
can be classified on the bases o f its 
degradation efficacy under following terms:  
• Ligninolytic fungal degradation  
• Fungal biosorption  
• Mycorrhizal fungal degradation [84]. 
Bjerkandera adusta, Trametes ve rsicolor, 
Phanerochaete chrysosporium have been 
approved for  textile  dyes treatment through 
their ligninolytic activities [85].

WRF have been shown to possess  
extraordinary dye decolorizing ability  (Table 8). These  are proficient  in mineralizing  a 
wide -rangin g pollutants, while bacteria are 
substrate specific . The main reason behind 
this degradative efficiency of white rot fungi Pure Appl. Biol., 9( 4): 2361-2382 , December , 2020

2369  to break down substances  such pollutant s and 
aromatic compounds is their lignin degrading  
enzymes, such as lignin  peroxidase (LiP) , 
manganese peroxidase (MnP)  and laccase  
that are not substrate -specific [88, 89] . Lignin 
peroxidase released  by Phanerochaete 
Chrysosporium has been reported to 
efficiently break down azo dye into simpler 
compounds  [90]. 
Lignin, a polymer pre sent in woody plants is 
broken down  by WRF . The wood -rotting 
Phanerochaete chrysosporium  is a white -rot 
fungus  that is capable to degrade  variety of 
xenobiotic pollutants such as dioxins, 
polychlorinated biphenyls (P CBs) and o ther chloro -organics. Coriolus  versicolo , 
Trametes versicolor , Pleurotus ostreatus  and 
Coriolopsis polysona  are som e other reported 
WRF  that show ability to remove color from 
dyes [101] . LiP and Mn -dependen t 
peroxidase (MnP) or laccase enzymes ar e 
main agents of  color removal by WRF  [102, 
103]. 
Different fungal species are also capable of 
reducing heavy metals from waste laden 
water some of which are listed in (Table 9) . 
Trametes versicolor  is an specie of interest 
because of its ability to decolorize different 
colored compounds re leased from textile and 
other industries  [109, 110] .

2370  Fungal enzymes and biodegradation  
Fungi are t he good producer when it comes 
to enzyme production. Surface cu lture 
method is used to produce  commer cial fungal 
enzymes [111] . White rot fungi are  very 
successful  entities with extraordinary lignin 
degradation ability. E xtracellular 
oxidoreductases  enzymes such as  laccases , 
peroxidases and oxidases  are produced by 
WRF that perform biodegradation [112] . The 
main role of these  enzymes is to degrade lignin  but because these enzymes are not 
substrate -specific these are also capable to 
break different aromatic persistent  
compounds  (Table 10)  involved in causing 
environment related issues  [113] . WRF are 
better dye -decolorizers as compared to 
prokaryotes.  P. chryso sporium  is a principle  
decolorizer compared to other microbes , 
whose decolorizing capability  is due to lignin 
peroxidase (LiP) and manganese peroxidases 
(MnP) [114] .

The survival of fungi depends upon their 
ability to adjust their metabolism according 
to changing level of  carbon a nd nitrogen . 
Intracellular and  extracellular enzymes are 
produced by fungi to achieve this metabolic 
activity and these further carry out  non-
specific degradation of different resistant 
effluents such as aromatic hydrocarbo ns, 
organic waste, dye compounds  etc. Non-
substrate specific nature of fungal enzyme  
syste ms is the main reason behind their 
ability t o disintegrate  colored and metallic 
effluents  [121] . Similar enzym es because of  
their low  specificity for  substrate  (lignin) 
have also been employed  successfully in the 
degradation  of dyes . Only a few reports have 
shown the capability  of Brown -rot fungi to  
remove various  dyes [80]. 
 
 Enzymatic degradation of textile effluents  
Enzymes have several beneficial 
characteristics  related to degradation . When 
it comes to the amount  and composition of 
effluent s, the most polluting  effluent released 
from industrial sec tor is textile wastewater  
[122, 123] . The disadvantages that we face 
while using microorganisms  for degradation 
activities can be overcome easily by using 
enzymes as an alternate  [124] . Enzymes have 
the capability to  efficiently  break down  a 
target polluta nt (Table 11)  with no effect on  
the other constituents  in the wastewater . 
Therefore, pollutant s that are quite resistant 
toward disintegration can easily be degraded 
by enzymes. H ydrolases,  dehalogenases, 
transferases and oxidoreductase s are some of 
the mo st important enzyme classes actively 
involved in bioremediation processes. An 
example of enzyme  active in removal of Pure Appl. Biol., 9( 4): 2361-2382 , December , 2020  
http://dx.d oi.org/10.19045/bspab.2020.90251  
2371  pollutants is Laccase [125]  . Extracellular 
enzymes of ligninolytic fungi, white rot fungi  
are important for disintegration of dyestuff 
and also lignin [126] . It is adv antageous to 
use WRF for degradative purposes  then 
bacteria. The non -substrate specific nature of 
extrac ellular enzymes such as  LiP, MnP , 
laccase and Mn -independent versatile 
peroxidases (VP) give white rot fungi this 
extraordi nary efficiency to break down 
resistant aromati c color compounds  [127] . 
Microbial enzymes have many desirable 
properties such as they give maximum possible yields , their  genetic make up can 
easily be manipulated, easy availability due 
to absence of  seasonal  fluctuations and high 
growth of microbes than enzymes produced 
by plants and animals . Microbial enzymes  are 
also important in that  they have high stability 
and are easy to produce . Several dyes have 
been reported to be de colorize by white rot 
fungi which  shows  that these entities are an 
important alternative for management  of 
indus trial dye containing effluents  [128] .

It was reported in another study  that WRF  
breaks down  Crystal Violet dye via N-
demethylation The main reaction of azo dyes 
disintegration by bacteria includes  breakage  
of azo bonds  by an azoreductase enzyme and 
an electron donor. Azo dyes containing 
textile waste water can be bio -treated 
effectively by developing treatment 
processes t hat uses azoreductase producing  
microbes. These azoreduc tase enzymes can catalyze the cleavage of azo compounds by 
reduction [136] . 
The most important bacteria l enzymes 
involved in degradation activities are 
azoreductases  (Table 12) . Azoreductases  
cause breakage of azo bonds ( –N = N –), 
producing  aromatic amines which are further 
converted  into CO2 and H2O under aerobic 
environments  [137] . 
 Sharif et al.  
2372  Yeast degradation ability  
The large absorption of dyes,  heavy metals , 
colorants  makes the yeast a good microbe  for 
bioremediation of azo dyes  (Table 13) . The 
enzymatic degradation and adsorption o r the 
combination of both are the main practices  by 
which yeast  degrades azo dyes . The  Remazol 
Blue and Reactive Red dyes can be 
efficiently  removed up to 94 % and 44 % 
respectively by using Candida  tropicalis 
[144] . There are only quite few studies about 
yeast decolorization ability . Pseudozyma  
rugulosa  and Candida krusei  are the yeast 
strains that exhibited excellent color removal of reactive azo dyes. Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae effectively decolorize methyl red 
at different pH with involvement of  
azoreduct ase [145] . 
There is growing interest for biological 
treatment of waste water compounds  such as  
textile effluents mainly dyes,  metals, 
inorganic nutrient, and organic compounds 
through biosorption, biodegradation , 
bioaccumulation, and enzymatic 
mineralization [151] . The fungi reduce azo 
dyes by producing extracellular enzymes 
such as peroxidases and phenol oxidases  
[152] .

Degradation of textile effluent through 
biosorption  
The absorption or uptake  of chemicals by 
microbial mass  is known  as biosorption  or 
more precisely it can also be described  as “ the 
capability of microbes  to amass  heavy metals 
from wastewater through metabolic  or physio -
chemical paths of absorption ” [153] . It mainly 
occurs through  cell wall, whe reas adsorption and absorpt ion depending upon  biomass type 
[154] . 
Algae, yeast, filamentous fungi and bacteria  
can be used to  eliminate  dyes from wastewater 
by biosorption by using their biomass.  
Heteropolysaccharide and lipid are integral part 
of the cell  wall and have different funct ional 
groups such as amino, carboxyl , hydroxyl 
group and other charged components and have Pure Appl. Biol., 9( 4): 2361-2382 , December , 2020  
http://dx.d oi.org/10.19045/bspab.2020.90251  
2373  biosorption properties. Strong attractive forces 
develop between the azo dye and these 
functional groups of cell wall of different 
microbes such as yeast, algae bacteria and 
filamentous fun gi. Thus these components of 
cell wall are responsible for biosorption 
capacity of microbes [155] .  
Biosorption is attribute  of specific type of 
microbial biomass to make bond with  and to 
accumulate wastes and heavy metals present in 
effluents . Biomass has ability to act just like a  
chemical element or  ion exchanger that is 
originated from biological  source . The main 
component of fungi, bacteria and algae 
responsible for biosorption is cell wall . Until 
now, it has been widely reported that 
biosorption is a perfect  substitute  for cleansing  
of metal holding  effluents [156] .  
Biosorption with microorganism s, especially 
fungus (Table 9 ) for elimination  of colorants  
from  textile  waste water  has gained signific ant 
attention. Decoloring of synthetic dyes and dye 
effluents have been studied by using different  
fungi.  With re spect to bacterial bioso rption 
capacity, Aeromonas s p., Pseudomonas 
luteola, E. coli , Bacillus subtilis and 
Staphylococcus aureus are some of b acterial 
strains being used  for their bio sorbent  
properties for decontamination of  class of dyes 
known as reactive dyes . The chief  advantage s 
offered by  biosorption over old treatment 
processes  include  high effectiveness, low cost, 
minimization of sludge,  recovery of metals, 
bio-sorbent regeneration, easiness to recover 
metals etc . [157] .  
Mechanisms of biosorption   
There are many ways by which microbes can 
take up metals and this is due to their complex 
structure. There are many  criteria to classify 
bioso rption processes. Biosorption processe s based on cellular metabolism can be classified 
as follow : 
1. Metabolism  dependent biosorption  
2. Non -metabolism dependent biosorption  
Biosorption can also be classified as 
intracellular/extracell ular biosorption and  cell 
surface sorption depending upon the location 
where metal biosorbed from  effluents is found  
[158] .  
A typical biosorption route has two phases;   
1. A  solid phase (sorbent or biosorbent; 
commonly  a living  material)  
2. And a liquid phase (solvent, usually H2O ) 
comprising a dissolved substance  to be sorbed 
(sorbate, a metal ion)  [153] . 
Biosorption and heavy metal removal  
Biosorption refer s to the elimination  of heavy 
metals and other harmful substances from a 
liquid solution by  passively binding to non -
living biomass. From this, it can be concluded 
that process is not metabolism dependent. 
Bioaccumulation , in contrast  refer to an active 
removal of various metals by living organisms 
and this process is controlled metabolically. 
Different bio -sorbents organ isms include  algae, 
bacteria l strains , different yeasts  strains , fungi 
(Table 14)  can be used to treat heavy metal 
effluents [159, 160] . 
There are two chief mechanisms  by which 
metals are biosorbed [161, 162] .  
1. Active biosorption ( metabolism -dependent)  
2. And passive ( metabolism - independent ).  
Active process of biosorption  requires specific 
kind of conditions such as pH, temperature, 
nutrients that are necessary for maintain 
cellular functions. Passive biosorption 
processes, in contrast, occurs in livi ng as well 
as in  dead  cells and take place under wide -
ranging environmental conditions. The  passive 
process es are more efficient as compared to 
active biosorption [162, 163] .

Conclusion  
Microorganisms  are organism s of interest 
because of their eff iciency for degradation. 
These include bacteria that are  useful especially 
for degradation of resistant azo dyes which  are 
being used extensively in textile industry. 
Algae are also being used widely for 
degradation and decolorization  of textile 
effluents.  Several algal species have capability 
of degrading different dyes, colorants and also 
organic pollutants. Similarly , fungi also have 
huge importance in bioremediation process. 
Different fungal enzymes have potential to 
breakdown different dyes with greate r 
efficiency. Most important fungal specie s in 
context of degradation is wh ite rot fungi which 
can degrade complex effluents by using 
different enzymes. Enzymes can provide an 
alternate for effluent treatment because of their 
absorption and degradation pro perties. 
Enzymes, the biological catalysts can take up 
different dyes including most resistant azo 
dyes. The enormous absorption of dyes and 
heavy metals makes the yeast a good candidate 
for bio degradation of azo dyes.  Thus it can be 
concluded that microor ganisms have huge 
potential for remediation of effluents and can 
successfully be employed for making our 
environment clean and healthy. So, there is a 
need for further exploration of degradation 
capabilities of different microbes.
