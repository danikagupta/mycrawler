ABSTRACT
Environmental concern over the discharge of improperly treated textile wastewater has been on the rise. The present 
study explored the use of the limitedly studied, tropical Rhodococcus  pyridinivorans  for the decolorization of crystal 
violet, a typically encountered dye in the textile industry. The effect of agitation speed, temperature, pH, nutritional 
source, initial dye concentration, and size of inoculum on crystal violet removal were evaluated using one-factor-
at-a-time method. Decolorization of 0.6 mM crystal violet carried out at agitated mode showed 73 ± 3% crystal 
violet removal efficiency in comparison to static mode (43 ± 2%) after 24 h. This crystal violet removal efficiency 
escalated to 91 ± 2% after optimizing the culture conditions at 45°C and pH 7 using maltose as carbon source 
and 12% (v/v) size of inoculum. Furthermore, the optimization process reduced the incubation time to achieve 
almost complete decolorization by 67%. Ultraviolet–visible analysis revealed that the decolorization of crystal violet 
primarily occurred through biodegradation. The findings from this study validated the potential of  R. pyridinivorans  
as an effective biocatalyst to remediate crystal violet. R. pyridinivorans  will be attempted to decolorize different 
triphenylmethane dyes, namely, malachite green in future studies.
1. INTRODUCTION
Triphenylmethane dyes are multipurpose and serve a major role in 
numerous industrial applications [1]. As one of the triphenylmethane 
dyes, crystal violet has been expansively used as a biological stain and 
textile dye [2]. The aromatic structure of crystal violet is s table  and thus, 
it endures environmental degradation and is able to persist in wastewater 
and soil for an extended period of time [3]. Crystal violet was reported 
to be recalcitrant, exhibiting the potential to cause cancer and lead to 
gene mutation [2]. Exposure to crystal violet can cause humans severe 
damages to the eyes, difficulties in inhalation, vomiting, diarrhea, and 
skin irritation due to its corrosive and toxic nature [4]. Improperly treated 
crystal violet-containing wastewater, on the other hand, remains toxic 
and when discharged, it can be detrimental to agricultural productivity 
due to death of soil microorganisms as a result from crystal violet 
toxicity [5]. Therefore, textile wastewater containing crystal violet needs 
to be competently treated to ensure safe disposal into the environment.
There are a few physical and chemical methods popularly used 
to treat colored wastewater, namely, adsorption and ozonation. 
However, their applications are restricted due to the showcase of many 
weaknesses such as high cost, generation of secondary pollutants, and incomplete removal of the toxic colorants [6]. On the contrary, the 
use of microorganisms, particularly bacteria to remediate textile dyes, 
has been on the rise. This is attribu table  to the metabolic activities 
of bacteria which can be exploited to transform dyes to by-products 
exhibiting reduced toxicity at an enhanced rate of decolorization [7,8].
Rhodococcus,  in particular, plays a key role in environmental 
biotechnology and industrial biotechnology, demonstrating promising 
potential in the bioremediation of toxic pollutants and biotransformation 
to generate commercially beneficial compounds [9-11]. Rhodococcus  
acquires the characteristics which allow this genus to survive in severe 
and extreme conditions and they possess a diverse array of anabolic 
genes, catabolic genes, and unique cell wall structure along with 
numerous enzymatic capabilities [12]. In view of this, Rhodococcus  
has been attempted in the present study to bioremediate crystal violet.
Although the use of biological method is advantageous and the 
employment of Rhodococcus  as the biocatalyst provides added values 
to the method, the application to solve real-time problems is still 
challenging due to fluctuating conditions such as pH values which 
can hamper cell growth and metabolic activities [13]. Therefore, 
optimization using one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) approach (monothetic 
analysis) was prioritized in the present study to obtain accelerated rate 
of crystal violet removal. This method of optimization is still relevant 
due to its straightforward approach and simplicity in analyzing data 
to obtain the most favorable medium and physical parameters such 
as pH, temperature, and agitation formulation for crystal violet 
removal in this case [14]. In addition, although a previous study by

Li et al. [6] demonstrated the use of Rhodococcus qingshengii  JB301 
in decolorizing crystal violet, the application of Rhodococcus isolated 
from a tropical environment for crystal violet removal is scarcely 
reported in the literature. Thus, the present study concentrated on 
discovering the optimum conditions required for enhanced removal of 
crystal violet by a Malaysian Rhodococcus pyridinivorans .
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1. Chemicals and Media Composition
The preparation of standard stock solution was carried out using crystal 
violet purchased from Merck (Germany). Repu table  suppliers such as 
Merck (Germany), R&M Chemicals (UK), or Bendosen (Malaysia) 
were engaged to purchase analytical grade media ingredients, namely, 
yeast extract, KH2PO4, K2HPO4, MgSO4, and CaCl2. These chemicals 
required no further treatment or purification and can be directly used 
for experimentation. Minimal salt medium (MSM) consisting of 
100 mL modified 10X M9 salts (50 g/L KH2PO4, 50 g/L K2HPO4, 
and 5 g/L NaCl), 2 mL 1 M MgSO4, 0.2 mL 0.5 M CaCl2, and 2 mL 
100 g/L yeast extract in 900 mL deionized water was used throughout 
this study as the standard medium. The pH of the medium was adjusted 
using stock solutions of 2 M HCl and 2 M NaOH as needed.
2.2. Isolation of R. pyridinivorans
Sludge sample located at Kuala Lukut, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia, 
was used as the sampling area to isolate R. pyridinivorans . This 
strain was routinely conserved and stored at the Culture Collection 
Unit of Institute of Bio-IT Selangor, Universiti Selangor. This strain 
was placed at the GenBank® (NCBI) and identified with an accession 
number MN56069 [15].
2.3. Decolorization Study
The decolorization medium was composed of  sterilized MSM medium 
amended with 0.6 mM crystal violet and supplemented with 10% (v/v) 
inoculum (optical density kept in the range of 1.0–1.1 at 600 nm) grown 
in the same medium (without 0.6 mM crystal violet) to exponential 
phase (36–48 h) at 30°C and 160 rpm (SI-600R, Lab Companion). 
The decolorization study used 0.6 mM crystal violet since this was 
the minimum concentration in which  R. pyridinivorans  could grow 
during the initial screening stage on solid agar medium (effect of 
higher concentrations of crystal violet on the decolorization will be 
tested during the optimization study). The decolorization study was 
carried out in triplicate at 30°C for 24 h under agitated mode (160 rpm) 
and static mode (0 rpm), respectively. A  control experiment was set-up 
without the addition of inoculum.
The initial reading of the sample absorbance was taken at 0 h and the 
second reading was taken after 24 h. An amount of 1.5 mL samples was 
removed from the decolorization medium into the Eppendorf tubes and 
centrifuged at 4°C and 14 000 × g for 15 min (Tomy MX-305 High-
Speed Refrigerated Microcentrifuge, Japan). The absorbance was taken 
at multiple wavelengths ranging from 200 to 700 nm using ultraviolet–
visible (UV–Vis) spectrophotometer (Biospectrophotometer BioMate 
3, Thermo Scientific, USA). The maximum absorbance wavelength 
(λmax) of 590 nm found in this protocol was used for subsequent 
studies. The percentage of decolorization was determined following 
the formula below:

2.4. Optimization Study
Optimization studies were carried out using the MSM medium added with 0.6 
mM crystal violet (concentrations were varied for initial dye concentration 
study) and inoculated with 10% (v/v) inoculum (concentrations were 
varied for size of inoculum study) using OFAT approach (one factor was 
varied whereas the others were kept constant). When the effect of carbon 
source on crystal violet removal was studied, yeast extract was replaced 
accordingly. The optimization study was carried out for 24 h when the 
effect of different initial pH (4–10) and temperature (25–45°C) was 
tested. The incubation period was reduced to 12 h when varying 0.5 g/L 
carbon source (glucose, sucrose, maltose, orange peel, shredded coconut 
shells, sugarcane bagasse, and banana peel), size of inoculum (4% [v/v]–
20% [v/v]), and initial dye concentration (0.1–2.4 mM). The incubation 
period was reduced to determine the optimum condition for crystal violet 
removal using these factors since 24 h incubation period yielded almost 
similar results among all tested parameters. The control experiment was 
established in the absence of inoculum.
When 0.6 mM initial dye concentration was evaluated, repeated 
addition of 0.6 mM dye was carried out for 4 cycles. Once complete 
decolorization occurred, crystal violet stock solutions were pipetted 
into the decolorized dye solution to give a final concentration of 
0.6 mM. The flasks were incubated and hourly absorbance reading 
was taken until decolorization was completed or when maximum 
decolorization had occurred.
2.5. Statistical Analysis
The comparisons between groups were determined using one-way 
analysis of variance (ANOV A) IBM SPSS version 23. Duncan test 
(represented by different letters) was selected for post hoc  analysis. 
P < 0.05 was labeled as statistically significant.
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Decolorization of Crystal Violet under Shaking and Static 
Condition
The control system exhibited negligible abiotic loss of crystal violet. 
When compared with the control system, decolorization carried out 
at static condition did not yield significant color changes. On the 
other hand, when the decolorization was established under shaking 
condition, substantial changes in the color were observed. The initial 
violet color changed to colorless (after centrifugation to remove the 
cell pellet) possibly indicating the conversion of crystal violet to 
other metabolites by R. pyridinivorans . The static condition showed 
43 ± 2% decolorization while the shaking condition recorded 
73 ± 3% decolorization after 24 h incubation at 30°C. Therefore, 
the employment of shaking condition was favorable for crystal 
violet decolorization, resulting in 70% enhanced decolorization ( P 
˂ 0.05) compared to that of static condition. In addition, shaking 
condition promoted cell growth after 24 h (optical density at 
600 nm is 0.983 ± 0.078) which possibly assisted the decolorization 
in comparison to static condition (optical density at 600 nm is 
0.1923 ± 0.037).
Similar results were observed by Bharagava et al. [16], reporting 95% 
crystal violet removal at agitated mode (110 rpm) in comparison to 45% 
crystal violet removal at static condition by Aeromonas hydrophila . 
Another study by Gao et al. [17] reported identical findings when an Maniyam, et al. : Biodecolourization of crystal violet by malaysian Rhodococcus pyridinivorans  2022;10(Suppl 2):107-113 109
endophytic fungus, Bjerkandera adusta  SWUSI4 was found to be 
more effective in the decolorization of crystal violet under shaking 
condition (72%) than static condition (27%). Shaking condition 
allowed seamless transfer of oxygen between the cells and medium, 
leading to increased cell concentration [16] which suited the function 
of R. pyridinivorans  as an aerobic bacterium. Under agitated mode, 
primary enzymes such as lignin peroxidase and manganese through 
oxidative reactions may largely contribute to higher decolorization 
of crystal violet [16] as Rhodococcus strains were known to possess 
these enzymes [18-20]. On the contrary, the decolorization of crystal 
violet by Aspergillus niger  was established at static condition which 
may be caused by the presence of azoreductase [2]. Therefore, it can 
be assumed that the discrepancy of decolorization between static and 
agitated modes is microorganism dependent and related to the types of 
enzymes generated by these microorganisms.
3.2. UV–Vis Analysis
The UV–Vis spectrophotometric scanning between 200 nm and 
700 nm yielded the formation of three major peaks in the visible 
region of the spectrum, namely, at 260 nm, 330 nm, and 590 nm at 
0 h of incubation period [ Figure 1 ] corresponding to aromatic rings 
and the -C=C- bond. It was particularly interesting to observe the 
disappearance of one of the major peaks at 590 nm after 24 h of 
incubation period under shaking condition, suggesting the disrupt 
of conjugated structure and removal of electron-donating group. 
This peak decreased without any further changes or shifts in the 
maximum wavelength ( λmax) to complete the decolorization after 
24 h at 160 rpm. In contrast, Chen et al. [21] observed that with the 
increase of biodegradation time for the removal of crystal violet by 
Pseudomonas putida , there was a slight shift in the characteristic 
wavelength from 588 nm to 580 nm suggesting that a series of 
N-demethylated intermediates may be generated. Static cultures of 
R. pyridinivorans  did not facilitate rapid removal of crystal violet and 
marginal reduction in the intensity of the peak at 590 nm was detected 
after 24 h of incubation period.
In addition, the intensity of the peak at 330 nm reduced substantially 
after aerobic treatment due to decolorization which was not achieved 
in the static cultures, demonstrating only a slight decrease in the peak intensity. Similar finding was reported by Ayed et al . [22] which 
observed the diminishing intensity of the peaks at 592 nm and 330 nm, 
respectively, when the decolorization of crystal violet by Bacillus  sp. was 
carried out at agitated mode (150 rpm). Interestingly, the characteristic 
wavelength at 260 nm at 0 h decreased and shifted to 265 nm after 
24 h of incubation period under agitated mode which suggested the 
potential formation of intermediates during aerobic decolorization 
of crystal violet. This peak at 260 nm only reduced to a small extent 
in terms of peak strength under static condition. These alterations 
implied the formation of series of N-demethylated intermediates and 
cleavages of the whole conjugated chromophore structure. These 
findings, therefore, supported the role of biodegradation in addition 
to decolorization for crystal violet removal by R. pyridinivorans . 
Analysis of metabolites and the parent dye of crystal violet using 
Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and mass spectroscopy will 
be carried out as future study to identify the decolorization products 
and predict the biodegradation pathways.
3.3. Optimization of Study Using OFAT Approach
3.3.1. Effect of initial pH
The initial pH value of the culture medium was adjusted within a 
range of 4–10 to examine the effect of pH on the decolorization of 
crystal violet by R. pyridinivorans . It was fascinating to observe that 
the locally isolated actinomycete was able to decolorize the colorant 
at all tested pH values as tabulated in Table  1 although the growth 
was more favorable at alkaline conditions. This is due to the fact that 
Rhodococcus  is an actinomycete and actinomycetes preferentially 
thrive under alkaline condition [23].
Near neutral and alkaline condition seemed to be favorable for crystal 
violet decolorizing activity. Optimum removal of crystal violet was 
observed at pH 7 yielding 71a ± 1% whereas an average of 62% 
crystal violet decolorizing activity was recorded at pH values of 8 to 
10. Bharagava et al. [16] also reported pH 7 as the optimum culture 
condition for the removal of crystal violet by A. hydrophila . Optimum 
pH value of 7, furthermore, was observed for the removal of crystal 
violet by Nocardiopsis alba  which achieved 49% decolorization of 
100 mg/L of the colorant [24]. In addition, R. qingshengii  JB301 isolated 
Figure 1: Ultraviolet–visible spectra of crystal red subjected to decolorization by Rhodococcus  sp. at static and shaking conditions, respectively. Incubation was 
carried out 30°C and the pH was left unadjusted for 24 h with 0.6 mM crystal violet. Error bars represent standard error between three replicates.Maniyam, et al. : Journal of Applied Biology & Biotechnology  2022;10(Suppl 2):107-113

from saw dust was able to optimally decolorize and degrade crystal 
violet at broader pH values of 6–9, supporting the findings obtained 
in the present study [6]. However, the crystal violet decolorization 
was inhibited at pH 4 and 10 as reported by Li et al. [6], unlike the 
ability of R. pyridinivorans  in this study, which could decolorize 
crystal violet at an even broader pH range between 4 and 10, making 
the local isolate as an ideal biocatalyst for the decolorization of actual 
wastewater containing crystal violet from textile finishing plants and 
useful for other industrial applications [6]. The control system for each 
pH did not show any changes in their respective values, indicating 
that the occurrence of decolorization was indeed mediated by R. 
pyridinivorans  and was not due to shift in the pH values. In addition, 
no loss of crystal violet was detected in the control systems.3.3.2. Effect of temperature
After 24 h incubation at 45°C, 99a ± 1% decolorization was observed, 
as shown in Table  1, recording the highest removal of the colorant 
(P ˂ 0.05). Interestingly, there was no significant difference ( P ˃ 0.05) 
in terms of growth at the temperature range between 30°C and 45°C 
implying that the activity of enzymes for crystal violet decolorization 
was temperature specific. The removal of crystal violet was much 
slower at 25°C and 30°C documenting 65d ± 1% and 68d ± 3% 
decolorization, respectively. Based on the results from Table  1, we 
could conclude that the removal of crystal violet increased with 
increasing temperature. However, the capability of the local isolate to 
decolorize crystal violet at 50°C was hampered which may be due to 
inactivation of enzyme at higher temperatures.
R. pyridinivorans  is a thermophile, and therefore, the growth of the 
local isolate was still active at 45°C which led to optimum crystal 
violet decolorization. This finding is well supported by Bharagava 
et al. [16] which reported a temperature range between 30°C and 
45°C for optimum removal of crystal violet in the range of 80% and 
97% with temperature 45°C documenting substantial crystal violet 
decolorizing activity of 83%. In contrast, Cao et al. [25] reported a 
strain of Cedecea davisae  which was able to perform optimum crystal 
violet removal at 25–35°C. Similarly, laccase from Kabatiella bupleuri  
G3 was able to carry out 40% decolorization of 250 mg/L crystal violet 
at an optimum temperature of 30°C [26].
R. pyridinivorans  demonstrated appreciable crystal violet 
decolorization at a broad temperature range of 25–45°C with more 
than 50% decolorization of 0.6 mM crystal violet. This finding 
reinforced the use of the local isolate as biocatalyst for actual textile 
wastewater bioremediation since the strain was able to tolerate wide 
range of temperatures.
3.3.3. Effect of carbon source
An attempt to increase the ability of R. pyridinivorans  to decolorize 
crystal violet was carried out by supplementing auxiliary carbon 
sources to the culture medium. Different carbon sources, namely, 
maltose, sucrose, and glucose along with fruit wastes such as banana 
peel, shredded coconut shells, sugarcane bagasse, and orange peel 
were added separately into the medium containing the inoculated 
bacteria. Crystal violet removal was also measured in the control 
systems devoid of carbon sources and crystal violet, respectively, to 
evaluate the effect of carbon sources on the decolorization of crystal 
violet and to monitor the abiotic loss of crystal violet, respectively.
Almost complete decolorization of crystal violet was observed after 
24 h of incubation period when all tested carbon sources were used 
(P ˃ 0.05). Therefore, to determine the best carbon source for the 
decolorization of crystal violet by R. pyridinivorans , the incubation 
period was reduced to 12 h and the results are shown in Table  1. 
Crystal violet decolorization was the highest in the presence of maltose 
and sucrose (75a ± 1% and 74a ± 1%), respectively, followed by fruits 
wastes with an average crystal violet removal of 51% and glucose 
(29c ± 1%) while the control system without the addition of carbon 
source exhibited only 21 ± 1% crystal violet decolorization. This 
finding suggested that the presence of auxiliary carbon sources indeed 
assisted the growth of the isolate which simultaneously supported 
enhanced crystal violet decolorization. However, the strain was also 
able to use the dye as nutritional source for growth as evidenced by the 
removal of crystal violet in the control system. These results correlated 
with observation made by Gan et al. [27] indicating the presence of 
additional carbon source facilitated the decolorization of crystal violet 
by Burkholderia vietnamiensis  C09V .Table  1: Optimization of different culture conditions for the decolorization of

The control system without the addition of Rhodococcus  sp. recorded insignificant loss 
of crystal violet (<1 removal). The removal of crystal violet (%) was averaged between 
three readings and reported with ±standard errors. Different letters show significant 
differences among the evaluated factors ( P<0.05). aReports the highest value and freports 
the lowest value when comparison was made between the parameters in each factor. Maniyam, et al. : Biodecolourization of crystal violet by malaysian Rhodococcus pyridinivorans  2022;10(Suppl 2):107-113 111
A few reports found the presence of glucose as the most favorable 
external carbon source for the decolorization of crystal violet [16,27]. 
Glucose can be directly oxidized as an electron donor which can 
then be used as energy material by bacteria. However, in the present 
study, glucose seemed to be ineffective to promote decolorization 
of crystal violet even though good growth of R. pyridinivorans  was 
observed which may probably due to the cells assimilating the added 
glucose over the dye compound as the carbon source. Interestingly, the 
utilization of fruit wastes such as banana peel, shredded coconut shells, 
sugarcane bagasse, and orange peel supported the growth and crystal 
violet decolorization by R. pyridinivorans  even though the extent of 
decolorization did not vary significantly between these wastes ( P ˃ 
0.05). Therefore, easily available and inexpensive nutrient sources 
can be employed to grow the local isolate capable to perform removal 
of crystal violet quite substantially. This research could pave way on 
exploiting fruit wastes which are found in abundance in Malaysia as 
external carbon source for growth of microorganisms as biocatalyst for 
various industrial applications. This could provide an alternative for 
the disposal issues of agricultural residues promoting environmentally 
friendly wastewater treatment process [28].
3.3.4. Effect of initial concentration
The textile industry wastewater typically carries dye concentrations 
in the range of 60 mg/L–250 mg/L [16]. Therefore, the concentrations 
of crystal violet were varied in the present study from 0.3 mM to 2.4 
mM whereby the concentration of 0.6 mM corresponded to 245 mg/L 
crystal violet. The decolorization experiment was performed with 
increasing concentrations of crystal violet from 0.3 mM to 2.4 mM 
and R. pyridinivorans  was able to decolorize the colorant at all tested 
concentrations. When the concentrations of crystal violet were lower 
at 0.3 mM and 0.6 mM, higher crystal violet removal was observed 
resulting in 94 a ± 1% and 95 a ± 1% decolorization, respectively. 
This finding is interesting since the highest concentration of dye in 
the textile wastewater falls at 250 mg/L and R. pyridinivorans  could 
almost decolorize 245 mg/L crystal violet (0.6 mM) completely. 
Therefore, this local isolate has a huge potential to be applied as the 
biocatalyst for bioremediation of actual textile wastewater containing 
crystal violet.
As the initial concentration of crystal violet increased from 0.9 mM 
to 2.4 mM, the decolorization of crystal violet decreased from to 59 b ± 1% to 8 f ± 1% after 12 h of incubation period. The steady 
decreasing trend of crystal violet removal and increasing incubation 
period at higher concentrations of the colorant were observed in 
many previous reports [6,16,27,29]. The toxic effect of crystal violet 
at higher concentrations hampered the growth of R. pyridinivorans  
which simultaneously decreased the crystal removal efficiency, as 
shown in Table  1. In addition, metabolites from the decolorization 
process could saturate the bacterial cells and the active sites of the 
crystal violet decolorizing enzymes could be blocked by the presence 
of higher quantities of dye molecules, leading to decreased crystal 
violet removal efficiency at higher concentrations of the colorant [16].
Although the decolorization of crystal violet was inhibited at higher dye 
concentrations, the findings from this study exhibited more promising 
outcomes than reported previously. For instance, Gao et al . [17] 
reported a strain of B. adusta  SWUSI4 which could only decolorize 
34% of 250 mg/L crystal violet after an incubation period of 14 days. 
In addition, the incubation period taken to remove 47% of 150 mg/L 
crystal violet was 60 h when B. vietnamiensis  C09V was used [27] 
which required 400% longer time than reported in the present study. 
Furthermore, all isolates obtained in the study by Jakhrani et al.  [30] 
were unable to decolorize crystal violet at concentrations above 0.01 
mM during the screening assay further confirming the superior ability 
of our local strain for crystal violet removal.
3.3.5. Repeated dye addition
Consecutive crystal violet decolorization cycles were evaluated by 
repeatedly adding 0.6 mM of the colorant to the optimized culture medium 
containing R. pyridinivorans . Results indicated that the local isolate was 
capable to decolorize crystal violet almost completely up to 4 cycles and 
the crystal violet removal efficiency reduced to 39 ± 1% after 10 cycles 
[Figure 2 ]. The almost complete decolorization of 0.6 mM crystal violet 
was observed in the first cycle after 12 h of incubation period. The 
successive addition of the colorant (0.6 mM) resulted in an increased rate 
of crystal violet removal which was achieved within 2 h of incubation 
period up to cycle 4. The crystal violet removal efficiency, however, 
declined after the 4th cycle and required extended period of incubation 
to achieve higher crystal violet decolorization. For example, the addition 
of 0.6 mM crystal violet at the 7th cycle resulted in 44 ± 1% crystal violet 
removal after 24 h of incubation period. The availability of nutrients to 
support the growth of R. pyridinivorans  may be reduced over time which

 112
may lead to poorer secretion of crystal violet decolorizing enzymes [31] 
such as lignin peroxidase and manganese. Several studies have 
reported the importance of repeated use of microorganism as biological 
tool for dye decolorization for economic purposes and commercial 
applications [6,16]. In the present case, R. pyridinivorans  demonstrated 
excellent ability to remove 0.6 mM crystal violet for ten successive cycles 
although prolonged incubation period of 24 h was needed. These findings 
emphasized the advantages of using the local biocatalyst in terms of cost 
saving due to repeated use and environmentally friendly approach using 
biological method for bioremediation.
3.3.5. Effect of inoculum concentration
Crystal violet decolorization increased with an increase in the 
inoculum concentration of R. pyridinivorans  from 4% (v/v) to 12% 
(v/v). It was also interesting to observe that the period of incubation 
for efficient crystal violet removal reduced by 33% (from 12 h to 8 h; 
readings were taken every 4 h for 12 h) when the concentration of 
inoculum was varied from 4% (v/v) to 12% (v/v). The utilization of 
12% (v/v) inoculum concentration resulted in the highest crystal violet 
removal of 91a ± 2% ( P ˂ 0.05) within a short incubation period of 8 h. 
However, increasing the concentration of inoculum beyond 12% (v/v) 
did not support enhanced decolorization of crystal violet, yielding 
decreased crystal violet removal of 67b ± 2% and 49c ± 1% using 16% 
(v/v) and 20% (v/v) inoculum concentrations, respectively, after 12 h 
of incubation period. This may be due to the fact that the presence of 
higher bacteria populations limits the resources such as nutrients and 
oxygen for growth and crystal violet decolorization [6] as supported 
by the decrease in the cell growth at these inoculum concentrations 
[Table  1]. Similar observations were noticed when 97% decolorization 
of 30 mg/l crystal violet was achieved within 42 h at 30°C and pH 5 
under aerobic shaking condition by 5% (v/v) B. vietnamiensis  C09V . 
Increasing the concentration of inoculum to 6% (v/v) and 7% (v/v), 
respectively, inhibited the decolorization of crystal violet [6].
4. CONCLUSION
The present study reports effective removal of crystal violet by a novel 
tropical R. pyridinivorans . Almost complete decolorization of 0.6 mM 
crystal violet (95%) was achieved after 8 h when the experiment was 
carried out at pH 7 and 45°C using 12% (v/v) inoculum concentration 
and maltose as the carbon source. This finding is interesting because 
the biocatalyst could efficiently decolorize crystal violet within the 
common dye concentration range in the textile wastewater. In addition, 
the performance of this strain was quite consistent over a broad scale 
of pH (4–10) and temperature (25–45°C), which would be favorable 
in treating textile wastewater (mostly alkaline) and reduce the costs 
for heating since efficient decolorization could be achieved at normal 
temperatures. The decolorization of crystal violet by R. pyridinivorans  
was mostly accomplished through biodegradation as evidenced by 
the vanishing of major peaks and the shifting to new peaks from the 
UV–Vis analysis. Hence, this local strain which picturizes the richness 
of Malaysia’s biodiversity can be considered as a capable biocatalyst 
for textile wastewater treatment since it can be reused for 5 cycles at 
reduced incubation period without significant loss in the decolorization 
ability. Further study to explore the ability of R. pyridinivorans  to 
decolorize different triphenylmethane dyes, namely, malachite green 
will be endeavored to elucidate the versatility of the biocatalyst.
