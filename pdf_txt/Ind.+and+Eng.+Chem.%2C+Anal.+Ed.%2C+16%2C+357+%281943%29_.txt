SPECTROGRAPHIC EQUIPMENT
The ARL-DIETERT Spectrograph employs a _  large 
original permanent concave grating of the highest 
precision. The use of a grating with 24,400 lines per 
linear inch produces a very powerful Spectrograph 
which results in photographed spectrograms of out­
standing qualities.
ADVANTAGES
The ARL-DIETERT Grating spectrograph spaces 
the spectral lines in a linear order resulting in 
easy identification of spectral lines. Linear disper­
sion also means that the whole spectrum is ade­
quately dispersed in all wavelength regions.
The large number of ruled lines on the grating 
gives the instrument exceedingly fine resolv­
ing power. Like dispersion, the resolving power 
is maintained in all regions of the spectrum. 
Because of the adequate linear dispersion and fine 
resolution the ARL-DIETERT spectrograph is 
not restricted to a limited spectral range, but in­
stead, may be used in all regions.
Since the camera is normal to the grating, the film is 
held in exact focus along its entire length so that 
spectral lines in all regions of the spectrum are 
clearly and sharply defined. This arrangement of 
the camera insures that no false magnification of the 
spectral line occurs to reduce resolving power.
The spectrograph uses 35 mm. film for this type has 
the most uniform emulsion that can be obtained. 
Long spectrograms of \ ‘ l lU inches allows one ex­
posure to embrace the spectral lines of 72 elements 
which is sufficient for a complete analysis. Instru­ments giving shorter spectrograms require extra 
exposures with extra resetting adjustments which 
invite errors. The camera holds a 100 foot roll of 
film_ so that constant reloading of the camera is 
obviated.
Through the use of a concave grating, no lenses are 
required within the spectrograph. This is advan­
tageous for lenses increase film fog due to scattered 
lignt and also absorb light thus retarding speed. 
Extra lenses require additional care in maintenance 
and adjustment.
The spectrograph covers a 6620 A range in three 
exposures. To make it easy to photograph any of 
the three ranges each setting may be equipped with 
an individual optical bench and slit assembly which 
is rigidly bolted to the spectrograph frame. With 
this design all of the components remain in per­
manent adjustment for no setting need be disturbed 
to photograph any selected range.

NEW G-E MODEL CA-6 BERYLLIUM WINDOW 
X-RAY TUBE SPEEDS UP DIFFRACTION STUDIES
LINDEMANN GLASS WINDOW X-RAY DIFFRACTION TUBE 
G-E MODEL CA-6 BERYLLIUM WINDOW DIFFRACTION TUBE
THOROUGHLY TESTED -G-E perfected the Model 
CA-6 beryllium window x-ray diffraction tube 
early in 1941, and the first commercially avail­
able model was installed in the laboratory of a 
leading automotive manufacturer in August, 1941. 
The performance records of this and other CA -6 
tubes back up these facts:
SPEEDS UP STUDIES— The Model CA -6 has a trans­
mission factor, in the range of wavelengths for 
which these tubes are generally used, which is from 
six to ten times that of Lindemann glass window 
tubes. Typical normal exposures can be made with 
the CA -6 beryllium window tube in approximately 
one-seventh to one-tenth the time required by 
Lindemann window tubes.
INCREASED TUBE LIFE— The increased radiation out­
put of the CA -6 tube in itself effectively serves to 
lengthen tube life since it permits a greater number 
of exposures within a given time. In addition, its 
beryllium window is not susceptible to corrosion 
and x-ray deterioration.FACTS ABOUT THE CA-6 TUBE-The G-E M odel CA-6
tube is constructed with two beryllium windows in 
line with the long axis of the focal spot. The win­
dows are protected by a bakelite shield having high 
conductivity so that the shield may be operated at 
ground potential. The overall length of the tube is 
approximately 28 inches, and the diameter of the 
x-ray shield, the thickest portion of the tube, is 3K 
inches. Target materials immediately available for 
war production use include copper, cobalt, iron, and 
chromium. Molybdenum, nickel, tungsten and other 
materials are available on special order.

CA-6 tube, write or wire, today, to Dept. NN45.

MICRO COMBUSTION FURNACE
ELECTRIC HEATING, FOR TEMPERATURES UP TO 750°C
MICRO COMBUSTION FURNACE, Electric, von Czoernig-Alber, A.H.T. Co. Specification. For 
elementary quantitative organic microanalysis, including determinations for carbon and hydrogen, nitro­
gen by the Dumas method, halogens and sulfur by the catalytic procedure.
Provides uniform and constant températures within the ranges required for many types of micro tests simply by changing the  
position of the tube in  the furnace^  but the use of transformer or rheostat is suggested for critical work or when the tempera­
ture must be changed gradually without disturbing the tube.
The outside dimensions of the furnace body are 8 inches long X 21 /* inches deep X 2l/< inches high, with chamber 
8 inches long X l l/ie inches deep X l/i inch high. The hinged front is of transite and can be raised with unprotected 
fingers by wire handle. Mounted on an adjustable stand with leveling screws and adjustment for centering and clamping 
combustion tubes. Furnace body can be moved laterally, either to right or left, on tracks 15l/î inches long; also moved 
forward or backward for approximately 2 inches.
When operated without a resistance and with tube placed against the rear wall of chamber, temperature remains con­
stant at 700°C to 730°C under normal voltage conditions. By moving the furnace so that tube is midway between the 
front and rear of the chamber, temperatures between 670° and 700°C are obtainable. The lowest uniform temperatures are 
directly back of the hinged front where they are constant from 580° to 600°C. Constant temperatures can be attained in 
approximately 30 minutes without the use of a resistance. Average life of the heating element, when used without resis­
tance, is approximately 2000 hours. Maximum power consumption 3 amperes.
o The Electric Sample Heater "A ” is mounted on a carriage with rollers which fit the tracks of the furnace support on either
left or right end and replaces the Bunsen type gas burner generally used to heat the sample in the combustion tube before it reaches 
the furnace. Cylindrical chamber is 75 mm long X 13 mm inside diameter, with heating unit made of carefully tested iron-free
nichrome wire wound on a refractory core. Reproducible heating conditions are possible as the maximum temperature of 750 to
S00°C is uniform for a central zone of 45 mm without the use of transformer or rheostat. Will reach 650°C in ten minutes and 
cools off to 200°C in approx. twenty minutes. Three set screws provide centering adjustments and an insulated knob in front 
permits lateral movement at desired speed.

Physical-Chemical Method for Determination  
o f Vitamins D in Fish Liver Oils
D. T. EW ING a n d  G. V. KINGSLEY 
Michigan State College, East Lansing, Mich.
R. A. BROWN a n d  A. D. EMMETT 
I’arke, Davis and Company, Detroit, Mich.
SEVERAL methods for the physical-chem ical determina­
tion of vitamins D have been studied and reported on in 
recent years. Some of these have given good results on nearly 
pure samples of vitamins D2  and D3 . In the case of fish liver 
oils (D 3), agreement with the bioassay values has been ob­
tained only over limited concentration ranges for a small num­
ber of oils. Further study therefore seem ed warranted.
Reerink and van Wijk (16) and later Topelmann and Schuh- 
knecht (22) were successful in determining the concentration of 
vitamin D2  (irradiated ergosterol) by measuring the height of the 
ultraviolet absorption maximum at 265 mu. 01 Khin (14) al.so 
used this method in determining vitamin D2  in irradiation prod­
ucts. On the basis of the work of Brockmann (1, 2) that the 
molecular extinctions of the two vitamin forms were the same, 
Marcussen (11) applied the measurement at this maximum to the 
determination of both vitamins D2  and D3 . In the case of fish 
liver oil D3 , Marcussen first saponified the oil, then removed 
vitamin A, carotenoids, inactivated sterols, and other substances 
showing absorption in the region of 265 m/n by passing a heptane 
solution of the nonsaponifiable fraction through a Tswett column 
filled with Hydraffin K* as adsorbent. Thereby, he separated the 
vitamin D s  in the percolate. The concentration of vitamins D 
in this solution was then obtained spectrographically. Calciferol 
(British Drug House) was used as the standard for converting 
the E (1 per cent, 1  cm.) (the extinction, logio h / I, for a 1  per cent 
solution in a cell of 1-cm. thickness) of the fish liver oil to units 
per gram of oil. Marcussen gave values for two tuna liver oils, 
one halibut liver oil, and one oil solution of an irradiated product.
Halden and Tzoni (8, 9, 24)  obtained quantitative results with 
pure calciferol (D2 ) based on a color reaction formed by heating a 
solution of the vitamin and pyrogallol in benzene, petroleum 
ether, or chloroform with a fresh solution of anhydrous aluminum 
chloride in absolute alcohol. The deep violet color formed was 
dissolved in absolute alcohol, giving a lilac-red solution suitable 
for colorimetric measurements. In the determinations of fish 
liver oils, it was found necessary to remove vitamin A. Choles­
terol, ergosterol, and lumisterol did not interfere, but some of the 
irradiation products of ergosterol did give this color reaction.
Shear (20) suggested a colorimetric method based on the red 
color given by vitamins D in liver oils with a mixture of aniline 
and hydrochloric acid. Levine (10) reported that this color reac­
tion was not specific for vitamins D.
Stoeltzner (21) proposed a colorimetric method based on the 
formation of color when phosphorus pentachloride was added to 
an oil solution of vitamins D. However, this reaction was found 
by Christensen (4) to be typical of other compounds present in 
natural oils.
Rutkovskil (19) showed that the green color of the Tortelli- 
Jaffee reaction (28), formed when an acetic acid solution of vita­
mins D was mixed with a 2 per cent solution of bromine in chloro­
form, was also characteristic of the provitamins.Robinson (IS) reported a colorimetric method based on the 
yellow color formed when an alcohol solution of the vitamins D 
was boiled with sodium nitrite and acetic acid, then made slightly 
alkaline. This reaction was not given by cholesterol, ergosterol, 
dehydroergosterol, or lumisterol, but vitamin A gave a strong 
orange color and the nonsaponifiable fractions of olive oil and 
arachis oil also gave some color.
The antimony trichloride color reaction employed by Brock- 
mann and Chen (3) has been studied by a number of investigators 
as the basis for a quantitative method for vitamins D. They used 
a cold saturated solution of antimony trichloride in dry, alcohol- 
free chloroform. Both vitamins D. and D* gave an orange-yellow 
colored solution with an absorption maximum at 500 mju. 
Taehysterol gave a similar reaction, as did cholesterol, sitosterol, 
ergosterol, 7-dehydrocholesterol, lumisterol, suprasterol I, and 
suprasterol II. These all gave much weaker color, however, and 
did not interfere unless present in concentrations over thirty 
times that of the vitamins D. Vitamin A, with an absorption 
maximum at 620 m,u, interfered only when present up to six times 
the concentration of the vitamins D. This reagent thus seemed 
to serve as a dependable means for the colorimetric determination 
of vitamins D in the pure state, even when vitamin A and sterols 
were present in low concentrations.
On the other hand, Emmerie and van Eekelen (0) found that 
all vitamin A must be removed from fish liver oils before the anti­
mony trichloride color reaction is used.
Wolff (25) used the Brockmann and Chen color reaction for 
the determination of vitamin D- in nine samples of irradiated 
ergosterol, taking pure calciferol as the reference standard. His 
results showed deviations of from S to 40 per cent from the bio­
assay values. He also investigated the determination of vitamins 
D in fish liver oils, removing the vitamin A and carotenoids by 
chromatographic adsorption on Montana earth from benzene 
solution. He found it necessary to remove most of the sterols by 
the use of digitonin, when the potency of the oil was low.
Ritsert (17) removed vitamin A by chromatographic adsorp­
tion on aluminum oxide, but reported that this colorimetric 
method was not applicable to fish liver oils nor to the mixed prod­
ucts obtained by irradiation of the provitamins.
Raoul and Meunier (15) modified the reagent of Brockmann 
and Chen by adding a small amount of acetic anhydride and sul­
furic acid to the chloroform solution of antimony trichloride. 
They attempted to make use of the fading of the vitamin A color 
and of the concurrent slow formation of a cholesterol color to 
compute the vitamins D concentration by the rate of change in 
the absorption maxima. They suggested the use of digitonin to 
remove most of the sterols.
Nield, Russell, and Zimmerli (13) also modified the reagent of 
Brockmann and Chen by adding acetyl chloride and changing the 
concentration of the antimony trichloride. Thereby, they in­
creased the sensitivity and permanency of the color.
Milas, Heggie, and Raynolds (12) determined the vitamin A 
potency of fish liver oils by measuring the 620 m/i maximum.

Cholesterol, with an absorption maximum increasing slowly with 
time, was estimated by measuring the 480 m n maximum exactly 
30 minutes after adding the antimony trichloride reagent to the 
fish oil sample. Corrections for vitamin A and cholesterol, based 
on the above measurements, were then applied. Milas et cd. 
found better agreement, however, between the calculated poten­
cies and bioassay values when the vitamin A, carotenoids, and 
possibly 7-dehydrocholesterol were first removed by treatment 
with maleic anhydride. The vitamins D concentration was then 
obtained by measurement of the 500 rnp. maximum. Gudlet (7) 
also tried the use of maleic anhydride for removing vitamin A and 
freezing for the removal of sterols.
Ewing and Tomkins ( 6) separated vitamin A from the non- 
saponifiable fraction of 16 fish liver oils by chromatographic ad­
sorption on Superfiltrol from hexane-ether-alcohol solution. 
After removal of sterols with digitonin, the modified reagent of 
Nield, Russell, and Zimmerli (13) was used for the color reaction 
for vitamins D. Special attention was found necessary in the 
purification of the chloroform, including a final treatment with 
activated carbon.This review indicates that certain interfering substances 
must be removed from the nonsaponifiable fraction before a 
quantitative determination of the vitamins D can be made. 
Then it seem s possible to use som e modification of the anti­
mony trichloride color method after removal of the vitamin A. 
The authors chose for removal of the carotenoids, vitamin A, 
and pigments a modification of the chromatographic ad­
sorption procedure used by Ewing and Tomkins (6). Fur­
ther, while they depended upon freezing and treatment with 
digitonin for the removal of the sterols, the present authors 
base their procedure upon a tw o-step chromatographic treat­
ment w here the E(1 per cent, 1  cm.) is determined first for 
the combined vitamins D and sterols and second for the 
separated sterols. Then, by difference, the value for the vita­
mins D is obtained.
The schematic outline of the proposed method is given in 
stages I to V. The procedure is somewhat complicated; in 
fact, the minutest details should be followed exactly. To 
this end, definite instructions are given.
Equipment and Reagents
1. The adsorption columns must be carefully and uniformly 
prepared to obtain reproducible results. The tubes for the chro­
matographic determinations are made by sealing a 6-cm. length 
of 7-mm. Pyrex tubing to the bottom of a 1.6 X 15 cm. (0.625 
by 6-inch) Pyrex test tube. These tubes are cleaned before filling 
by soaking in sulfuric acid-dichromic acid solution, rinsing with 
distilled water and with alcohol, and finally drying in the flame 
of a Meker burner. The suction apparatus is designed so that a 
bank of 8 columns can be developed simultaneously, controlling 
the pressure with the aid of an open-tube mercury manometer 
attached to the suction flask. The adsorbent used is a finely 
divided grade of activated bentonite clay (Superfiltrol, ob­
tained from The Filtrol Corp., 315 West 5th St., Los Angeles, 
Calif.).
The adsorption columns for the first chromatographic separa­
tion are prepared by placing a small wad of cotton in the bottom 
of one of the adsorption tubes, pressing this down firmly, and add­
ing enough of the clay, so that when very firmly pressed down with 
a piston, using a cork on the end of a glass rod, under 6 cm. of 
suction, the height of the packed column will be 3 cm. A second 
and equal portion of the adsorbent is then added, and pressed 
do™ as before to give a hard, level surface. It is important that 
there should be no air pockets, as they cause irregularly shaped 
adsorption bands. To aid in overcoming this the piston-head 
cork used in packing the columns is but slightly smaller than the 
inside diameter of the Pyrex tube. This also helps avoid loosen­
ing of the adsorbent by suction when this cork piston is raised. 
Other columns for the chromatographic separation of vitamins D 
and sterols are prepared in the same manner, except that the 
height is only 1.5 cm. and the filling is done under a suction of 4 
cm.
2. Alcoholic potassium hydroxide is prepared by dissolving
14 grams of c. p. potassium hydroxide pellets in 95 per cent ethyl 
alcohol to give 500 ml. This stock solution is protected from car­
bon dioxide and filtered through hardened filter paper as needed.
3. c. p. ethyl ether is used without further purification for ex­
tracting the saponified oils and for elution of adsorption columns.
4. The anhydrous ethyl ether for the chromatograph is puri­
fied by washing c. p. ether with 1 per cent ferrous sulfate solution 
to remove peroxides, then 10 times with distilled water to remove 
alcohol, drying with phosphorus pentoxide, filtering, and storing 
over sodium. This ether is distilled from metallic sodium as 
needed.
5. The Skellysolve is purified by shaking with concentrated 
sulfuric acid, washing twice with 10 per cent sodium carbonate 
solution, then with a mixture of 10 per cent sodium carbonate 
and 5 per cent potassium permanganate solution. It is w r ashed 15 
times with distilled water, the reagent being decanted into a dry 
flask and dried over sodium. The dried solvent is then distilled 
(68° to 70° C.) from sodium, the first 5 per cent and the last 10 
per cent of the distillate being discarded.
6. The absolute ethyl alcohol is a high-grade commercial 
product.
7. c. p. chloroform is washed thoroughly with 7 approxi­
mately equal portions of water, dried over anhydrous potassium 
carbonate, decanted, and fractionated, discarding the first and
May 15, 1943 ANALYTICAL EDITION 3 0 3
last 10 per cent of the distillate. This purified chloroform is rela­
tively unstable and hence is prepared in small quantities, and 
protected from light. Before use, it is tested with silver nitrate 
solution for chlorides and with potassium iodide and starch solu­
tion for oxidizing agents. If these are absent, the chloroform is 
shaken with activated carbon and filtered just before using.
8. The antimony trichloride reagent is prepared by dissolving 
18 grams of c. p. antimony trichloride in the purified chloroform, 
diluting to 100 ml., filtering, and then adding 2 ml. of redistilled 
acetyl chloride (18). The best results are obtained when not 
more than one week’s supply of the purified chloroform and anti­
mony trichloride reagent is prepared at one time.
9. c. p. thiophene-free benzene is dried over sodium, distilled, 
and shaken with Superfiltrol before use.
10. Measurements of the absorption maxima at 500 m^ are 
made on a Bausch & Lomb visual spectrophotometer equipped 
with a Martins polarizing unit and cells 1  or 2 cm. thick.

biological assay value of 15,000 units per gram.
Application of Method
Fish oil samples are weighed in duplicate into 125-ml. Erlen- 
meyer flasks. Samples containing 4000 to 100,000 U. S..P. units 
of vitamins D are most convenient. Usually, 0.5 to 2 grams are 
weighed for natural oils and 0.1 gram for concentrates. If the 
samples weigh 1  gram or less, 10 ml. of alcoholic potassium hy­
droxide are-  added, but for samples weighing more than 1  gram, 
10 ml. of alcoholic potassium hydroxide per gram of sample are 
used. A short-stemmed funnel is then placed in the neck of the 
flask, to serve as a condenser. The sample is placed in a water 
bath and kept at 70° to 75° C. for 1  hour, or longer if saponifica­
tion is not complete. Agitation of the flask at frequent intervals 
aids this reaction. (At this point the sample may be allowed to 
stand overnight.)
The sample is cooled to room temperature, 20 ml. of water per
10 ml. of alcoholic potassium hydroxide are added, and it is then 
extracted in a separatory funnel with four 25-ml. portions of 
ethyl ether. Gentle shaking in the separatory funnel can be used 
without danger of emulsification, provided more than the indi­
cated quantity of water lias not been added. If an emulsion does 
form, it can be readily broken by the addition of a few drops of 
alcohol. The ether layer must always be clear before separation 
of the two layers.
Finally, all the ether extracts are combined in the separatory 
funnel and 50 ml. of water are added. When both ether and water 
layers are clear, the water layer is withdrawn and discarded, 
leaving the ether layer in the funnel. This preliminary washing, 
which removes most of the soaps, is repeated twice with fresh 50- 
ml. portions of water. Agitation during these preliminary wash­
ings may result in the formation of a stable emulsion. If this 
occurs 2 ml. of alcohol are added to break the emulsion. Twenty- 
five milliliters of water are now added to the ether extract in a 
separatory funnel and shaken vigorously, after which 25 ml. of 
water are added and the water and ether layers are allowed to 
separate. The water layer must be clear before it is withdrawn. 
This is again repeated twice; at the end of the third washing the 
ether and the water layers should separate quickly to a sharp in­
terface and appear very clear. The water layer at this point 
should be colorless and not alkaline to phenolphthalein. If not,the washing must be continued until these conditions are satis­
fied.
The washed ether extract is now withdrawn into a 125-ml. 
Erlenmeyer flask, passing through a filter paper containing an­
hydrous sodium sulfate. The separatory funnel is rinsed with 25 
ml. of ether and the rinsings are poured on the filter to remove 
vitamins D from the sodium sulfate and filter paper. These 
should be colorless. The ether solution is then evaporated to 
dryness under reduced pressure, using a water bath at 50 ° C.
The dry residue from this evaporation is taken up in 5 ml. of a 
special mixture of solvents prepared from the above purified ma­
terials—50 parts of Skellysolve, 10 parts of anhydrous ether, and 
1  part of absolute alcohol by volume. One drop of Sudan III 
solution (25 mg. per liter in the above mixed solvents) is added 
as a color marker, in the separation of vitamin A and pigments 
from vitamins D, following the suggestion of Brockmann (1) in 
his isolation of pure vitamin Ds , when he used Sudan III in a 1  
to 4 benzene-petroleum ether mixture.
The 6-cm. adsorption column (prepared as previously de­
scribed) is wetted with 10 ml. of the mixed solvent, and the sam­
ple is added, followed by 5 ml. of the solvent for rinsing the flask 
and 35 ml. of the same mixture for developing the adsorption 
bands. Each addition of solvent is made just before the top of the 
adsorption column becomes dry, otherwise it shrinks away from 
the glass walls and development of the column is not regular. A 
pressure differential of 6 cm. of mercury is maintained until 35 
ml. of the developing solution have been added, when the suc­
tion is increased to 10 cm. Further increase of the suction results 
in crevices in the adsorption column and packing of the adsorbent 
to such a degree that the flow of the developing solution is nearly 
stopped.
When the last of the 35 ml. of solution has passed through the 
column, the adsorbent is dried by drawing air through the 
column for 5 to 10 minutes. The Pyrex tube is then taken from 
its suction flask and the top layer of the column is removed to a 
point 2 mm. below the red Sudan III band, using an L-bent spat­
ula. This removes the vitamin A and pigments. The tube with 
the remainder of the column (carrying vitamins D and sterols) 
is replaced in its suction flask and eluted with 25 ml. of ether.
The combined filtrate and eluate are evaporated to dryness 
under reduced pressure and taken up in 10 ml. of purified chloro­
form. To 1  ml. of this solution are added 10 ml. of the antimony 
trichloride reagent. The flask is swirled for 30 seconds, the ab­
sorption cell filled, and the extinction determined on the Bausch 
& Lomb visual spectrophotometer exactly 3 minutes after start­
ing to add the reagent to the vitamin sample. The sample at this 
point contains vitamins D and sterols. ]

residue taken up in 1  ml. of chloroform. To this are added 10 
ml. of the antimony trichloride reagent, using a 2-cm. absorption 
cell. The extinction is determined at 500 mji exactly 3 minutes 
after mixing.
From these two extinction values, the E (l per cent, 1  
cm.) is calculated for vitamins D and sterols combined and 
for sterols alone. The difference between these two values 
gives the E (1 per cent, 1  cm.) for the vitamins D in  the origi­
nal sample. This value, multiplied by the factor 19,300 re­
ferred to below, gives the potency in U. S. P. units per gram of 
oil.
R e fe r e n c e  O il. A typical vitamins D mixed fish liver oil, 
No. 47,761, was selected as the reference oil and was bioassayed 
several times by the official U. S. P. method, giving an average 
potency of 15,000 U. S. P. units per gram. This oil was also care­
fully assayed 26 times by the proposed chemical method over a 
period of 2 months. The extinctions are given in Table I.
During this period several new lots of adsorbent, solvents, 
and antimony trichloride were used. The average E(1 per 
cent, 1 cm.) value is 0.778 with a maximum deviation of only 
±5 per cent. W ith this figure and the biological potency 
value of 15,000 units per gram, the standard conversion factor 
is calculated as 19,300 and is used throughout this report.
As a further check on the method, it was decided to deter­
mine whether cholesterol and ergosterol would interfere with 
the actual analysis of a fish liver oil. Accordingly, varying 
amounts of these substances were added to 1-gram samples of 
the reference oil (No. 47,761) and analyzed for vitamins D 
(Table II). These data show that adding even 0.5 gram of 
cholesterol above that already present in the natural fish liver 
oil caused an error of less than 7.3 per cent in the analysis. 
This amount of cholesterol is far higher than would be found 
in a fish liver oil. For 0.050 gram of added cholesterol the 
error due to the added cholesterol is only 2 per cent and this is 
well within the limit of reproducibility of the method as shown 
by Table I.
Further, the presence of the provitamin ergosterol (Table
II, 7, 8), in concentrations of slightly higher order than the 
vitamin itself, caused only an insignificant increase in the 
calculated potency, indicating that no measurable amount of 
the vitamins D  was formed during the analytical procedure.
Experimental Results
The application of the method was carried out on the fol­
lowing types of fish liver oil (Table I I I ) :
Units -per gram
3,000 to 7,000
12.000 to 35,000
12.000 to 28,000
65.000 to 325,000
15.000 to 31,000
250 to 1,200,000
The results in Table I I I  are self-explanatory, and show 
that the method is capable of reproducibility if the details of 
the procedure are followed exactly. The chemical determina­
tions were made in duplicate or triplicate— that is, two or 
more samples were weighed out and carried through the en­
tire procedure.
The over-all inspection of the results indicates a fairly close 
agreement between the physical-chemical method and the 
official U. S. P. procedure. The most outstanding variancelies in miscellaneous vitamins D fish liver oils, where it seems 
that with oils of a potency of 1200 or less U. S. P. units per 
gram, the errors are large. This may perhaps be attributed 
chiefly to taking large samples for test. This point is brought 
out clearly in the case of halibut oils 52,051 and 62,171. The 
outstanding differences may be due in part to a combination 
of errors, including those in the bioassay values which in them­
selves have a range of at least = ± =  10 per cent. The average per­
centage difference for all 51 oils is 9.7, and if we cxclude the 7 
oils which show a range of 20 per cent or more, the average for 
the remaining 44 samples is 5.8 per cent.
The last four oils listed in Table II I  were submitted as un­
knowns, for a further check on the efficiency of the chemical 
method. The biological assays were reported as having been 
carried out by the official U. S. P. method. The results agree 
satisfactorily.
Sum m ary and Conclusions
A physical-chemical method for determining vitamins D in 
fish liver oils is based upon the separation of the vitamins D 
from vitamin A and other interfering substances by chromato­
graph adsorption, and then measurement of the extinction 
coefficient at 500 m n of the reaction product in antimony tri­
chloride.
Data are presented'for the vitamins D potency of 51 liver 
oils from various types of salt-water fish. The values indicate 
that the proposed physical-chemical method, as outlined, 
gives results which are in fairly close agreement with those by 
the U. S. P. procedure for oils ranging from 5000 units per gram 
and up in potency. For weaker oils, the method is not so sat­
isfactory. Both possible simplification and its application to 
irradiated products are being studied.

Pantothenic Acid
Optical Rotation As a Measure of Stability
DOUGLAS V. FROST, Abbott Laboratories, N orth Chicago, III.
STABILITY studies in this laboratory on synthetic and 
naturally occurring pantothenic acid have indicated a 
high degree of lability for the compound in presence of acid 
or alkali. The rate of destruction in preliminary studies ap­
peared as a direct function of pH and of temperature. Fur­
thermore, the presence of certain compounds in solution cata­
lyzed the destruction of pantothenic acid even in the pH range 
of optimum stability.
A rapid chemical or physical method of analysis was de­
sired to follow the rate of destruction of pantothenic acid and 
its salts under various controlled conditions. Since the 
nature of the pantothenate molecule made it unlikely that 
chemical derivatives of specific analytical value could be 
found, the author turned to physical methods of analysis. 
The optical rotatory power of the compound appeared as one 
possibility, but presented some difficulties, since the nature 
of the destruction was not entirely known and at least one of 
the known hydrolysis products was also optically active. 
Only the dextrorotatory form of pantothenic acid is biologi­
cally active and the study was limited to this form.
Evidence of the structure of pantothenic acid first arose 
from a knowledge of its normal degradation products, and 
this in turn provided clues to the various methods of syn­
thesis.
Williams, Weinstock, Rohrmann, Trucsdail, Mitchell, and 
Meyer (6) in 1939 indicated that pantothenic acid undergoes 
cleavage in acid or alkaline media to form /3-alanine and an ali­
phatic dihydroxy acid. Woolley, Waisman, and Elvehjem
(7) confirmed this finding by condensing the acid halide of the 
dihydroxy acid fragment of pantothenic acid with /3-alanine to 
regenerate a compound having the full biological action of the 
original compound. Weinstock, Mitchell, Pratt, and Williams (4) 
isolated 0-alanine as one of the cleavage products shortly there­
after, and Woolley, Waisman, and Elvehjem (8) made the further 
observation that the dihydroxy acid portion of the molecule read­
ily forms a lactone. The dihydroxy acid portion of the mole­
cule was later determined as «, 7-dihydroxy-/5,/3-dimethyl butyric 
acid by Williams and Major (5). Various synthetic methods 
have since appeared from many laboratories which depend on the 
condensation of the dihydroxy acid, or its lactone or salt, with 
/3-alanine to form pantothenic acid.
Theory
Simple hydrolytic cleavage (I) of the pantothenate ion to 
yield /3-alanine and d(+)-a,y-dihydroxy-/3,/3-dimethylbutyric 
acid [hereinafter designated 
as d(+)-dihydroxy acid] 
and lactonization (II) of 
the d(+)-dihydroxy acid to 
form d (—)-«-hydroxy-/? ,(3 -  
d im ethy lbuty rolactone 
[hereinafter designated as 
d (—)-lactone] are pictured 
as in the formula to the 
right.
A 1 per cent solution of 
calcium d (+)-pantothenate 
theoretically gives rise to a 
0.545 per cent solution of the 
d (—)-lactone, assum ing
complete hydrolysis of 
pantothenate and complete 
lactonization of the d(+)-dihydroxy acid. The rate and completeness of lactoniza­
tion were not known; however, it appeared likely that 
rotation values could be established for known systems of 
the d (—)-lactone-d(+)-dihydroxy acid equilibrium which 
would be of value in predicting the nature of unknown sys­
tems which also contained unchanged pantothenate.
Experiments were qarried out to determine whether or not 
the above reactions could be reduced to a mathematical basis 
in which the measured rotation would serve as an index to the 
amount of unchanged pantothenate ion in solution at any 
time.
Experimental
The specific rotation of several samples of synthetic calcium 
d(+)-pantothenate in 1  per cent aqueous solution ranged from 
+25.5° to +27°. The values for highly purified d{ — )-a-hy- 
droxy-/3,/3-dimethylbutyrolactone ranged from —50° to —51.5°. 
[Grussner, Gatzi-Fichter, and Reichstein (i) reported the [a]'D T - s  
of the d( —)-lactone to be —49° (C = 4.012 in water) and the
[a] of the barium salt of the corresponding acid to be +5.5° 
{C = 2.8 in water).] All readings were taken at 25° to 26° C., 
using a sodium arc lamp, a 1 -decimeter tube, and a rotary polari- 
scope with Lippich polarimeter. 1
From the above-determined values a freshly made solution 
containing 2 parts of calcium d(-)-)-pantothenate to 1  part of 
d (—)-lactone would be expected to display zero rotation, since 
in these proportions the opposite rotatory powers of the two 
compounds almost exactly cancel out. This point was proved 
by experiment. A 0.545 per cent solution of the d(—)-lactone 
was found to have the calculated rotation, —27.5°. In 0.1 N 
sodium hydroxide the rotation shifted to +7 as the lactone ring 
opened to give the d(+)-dihydroxy acid. This change was 
quantitatively reversed by making the solution strongly acid. 
The reaction rate in either direction was greatly accelerated by 
heat.
The changes in optical rotation of a 1  per cent solution of 
calcium d(+)-pantothenate as it undergoes hydrolysis and 
lactonization of the d(+)-dihydroxy acid are pictured in two 
steps as follows:

Representing zero to complete hydrolysis at different pH levels
and complete (curve II) lactonization of the d(+)-dihydroxy 
acid, are shown in Figure 1.
The validity of curve I was tested by subjecting 1 per cent 
solutions of calcium pantothenate to treatment with 0.01 N 
sodium hydroxide at various temperatures and taking the 
rotation at intervals. In  all instances the specific rotation 
finally shifted from +27° to +7°. The reaction required 
several weeks at room temperature, but only about 24 hours at 
100° C.
In order to test the validity of curve II, the following ex­
periment was conducted, in which unbuffered solutions of 
calcium d(+)-pantothenate were made to acid pH to favor 
lactonization of the < 2(+)-dihydroxy acid.
C a lc iu m  P a n to th e n a te  U n b u ffe r e d . One per cent solu­
tions of calcium d(+)-pantothenate were made to pH 4.0, 4.6, 
and 5.2 with hydrochloric acid and placed in wcll-capped bottles 
in a 60° oven. The rate of destruction was followed at 5-day 
intervals by measurement of the rotation and by microbiological 
assay by the method of Strong, Feeney, and Earle ( 2). The gen­
eral good agreement between the values estimated from curve I 
and the microbiological assay values is shown in Table I.The gradual rise in the pH of all solutions 
can be ascribed to the liberation of /3-alanine, 
which has an isoelectric point close to pH 6, 
and to the gradual lactonization of the 
d(+)-dihydroxy acid, which exerts a pH 
effect about 3.5 as the free acid. The rate 
of pH change decreased as the more stable 
range was approached. This paralleled the 
lessened rate of destruction.
E f f e c t  o f  pH o n  d ( — )-a-HYDROXY-| 8,/S -  
d im e t h y lb t jty r o la c to n e . The above ex­
periment indicated that lactone formation 
was complete below pH 5.0, as might be 
expected. In order to determine the effect 
of pH on the extent of lactonization, the 
following experiments were conducted:
A 1  per cent solution of the d (— )-lactone 
was subjected to 60° for 1 0 days. The original 
pIT was 4.6 and had changed to_ 3.6 at the 
end of the period; however, the original specific 
rotation of —51° did not change significantly 
throughout the period.
The necessity of buffering solutions for 
further study was indicated, and equal aliquots 
of a 1 per ccnt solution of the d( — )-lactone 
were made to pH 7.4, 6.6, 6.0, and 4.8 with 
mixtures of 3 per cent solutions of monosodium 
and disodium phosphate. Original rotations 
were taken immediately. The solutions were 
placed at 60° and samples were removed for rotation measure­
ments in 2, 5, and 7 days (Table II). Equilibrium between the 
lactone and acid forms was apparently reached in about 2 days 
and was not changed significantly thereafter.

In view of the above finding, it appeared possible to cal­
culate corrections from the standard decomposition curve of 
pantothenic acid to account for incomplete lactone formation 
at any constant pH. The following experiment was run to 
test this possibility:

d(+)-pantothenate and a 0.545 per ccnt solution of the d (—)~  
lactone were made up and each solution was divided into four 
equal parts. The equal parts of the two solutions were then 
paired off and the members of each pair were made to compar­
able pH, using small amounts of monosodium and disodium 
phosphate, sodium hydroxide, and concentrated phosphoric acid 
as required. Calcium phosphate precipitated in the calcium 
pantothenate solutions, but did not interfere with the collec­
tion of data. All solutions were kept at 60° and aliquots were 
taken for rotation and assay at 5-day intervals. Small pH 
changes occurred throughout the experiment, but the pH in each 
case was maintained in a narrow range. The pH ranges for the 
paired solutions are shown in Table III.
The d( —)-lactone was stable at pH 3.9 to 4.7. In the range 
pH 4.9 to 5.2, the hydrolysis of the lactone occurred very 
slowly and to only a slight extent. At pH 5.6 to 5.9 the

hydrolysis of the lactone was more rapid in the initial stages 
but continued throughout the entire period. No correction 
appeared to be necessary in the calcium pantothenate esti­
mations in groups 1 and 2, and curve I (Figure 1) was applied 
with fair success, as seen in Table III. Corrections for in­
complete lactone formation were made, as indicated, for 
groups 3 and 4. The corrections were made by varying the 
standard curve (Figure 1) to correspond with the specific 
rotation value obtained for the d(—)-lactone at the particu­
lar pH and time in question. These corrections are rapidly 
■obtained for paired solutions by extending a line on the stand­
ard curve from the +27° point for 1 per cent calcium panto­
thenate to the a(—)-lactone value in question and reading the 
residual calcium pantothenate of the paired pantothenate 
solution directly from its rotation value. All the correction 
curves fall naturally between curves I and I I  (Figure 1). 
As seen in Table III, the corrected estimates are in somewhat 
better agreement with the microbiological assay values than 
the uncorrected estimates.

ments the equilibria values obtained at various pH values 
starting from the d(-)-lactone were thought to be equivalent 
to those which would be obtained starting from the corre­
sponding d(+ ) -dihydroxy acid. That this assumption is 
essentially correct appears to be borne out by the results of 
the experiments; however, a large difference may exist in the 
rate of closing and opening of the lactone ring, and the effect 
of temperature on the equilibrium between the two forms ob­
tained at any constant pH was not known. The following 
experiments were run to study the effect of pH and tempera­
ture on the rate and completeness of lactonization of the 
<i(+)-dihydroxv acid.
A 0.545 per cent solution of the d(—)-lactone in 0.01 N sodium 
hydroxide was converted quantitatively to the d(+)-dihydroxy 
acid by mild heating. The solution was divided into 5 equal 
parts which were made to varying pH values by adding appro­
priate mixtures of dry phosphate buffer plus hydrochloric acid 
as needed (Table IV). Half of each buffered solution was placed 
at 60° and the other half maintained at room temperature. 
Optical rotation measurements were made at intervals, as shown 
in Table IV.Lactonization proceeded much 
more rapidly at 60° than at room 
temperature. Equilibrium was at­
tained between the acid and lactone 
forms at each pH level in a period 
of less than 20 days. This was 
true also in the preceding experi­
ments (Tables I I  and III) when 
starting from the d (—)-lactone.
Room-temperature studies with the 
d(+)-dihydroxy acid (Table IV) in­
dicated that equilibria values, par­
ticularly at the higher pH levels, 
may be different from those obtained 
at 60°. Equilibrium was not reached 
in 55 days in the samples at lower 
pH levels.
The rate of lactonization of d(+)- 
dihydroxy acid both at 60° and at 
room temperature appears to be 
greater than the rate of hydrolysis 
of pantothenate at all pH levels 
where the pH favors lactonization. 
Thus there should be no large excess 
of d(+)-dihydroxy acid arising from 
hydrolysis of pantothenate in solu­
tion at any time at pH levels which 
favor complete lactonization. At pH levels where lactoni­
zation is partial—i. e., pH 4.7 to 6— correction has been 
made most satisfactorily by use of paired solutions of the 
d (—)-lactone, as previously described. Use of the d(+)~  
dihydroxy acid has not proved so satisfactory for paired 
solutions at 60°.
As can be seen by comparing Tables I I I  and IV, equilibria 
values at equal pH levels àt 60° are about the same whether 
starting from the d( —)-lactone or the d(-f-)-dihydroxy acid. 
Thus, when equilibrium is reached, the correction will be 
about equal starting from either compound. Further study 
is needed to establish the validity of the method of correc­
tion as herein applied, particularly in regard to the beginning 
stages of pantothenate destruction.

solutions of calcium d(+)-pantothenate, containing 0.5 per 
cent of chlorobutanol as a preservative, were made to pH
2.2 and 1.3 with concentrated hydrochloric acid. Twice as 
much was used to acidify to pH 1.3 as was used to acidify to 
pH 2.2. The initial specific rotation of these solutions was 
+22° in each case. Further experiments indicated that the 
specific rotation of pantothenate is decreased progressively 
at pH more acid than 4. Stability studies were conducted 
on the above solutions with a control solution at pH 6.3, as 
shown in Table V.
In the case of solutions more acid than pH 4, estimations 
for residual pantothenate made from curve I I  (Figure 1) 
fell considerably below the values found by microbiological 
assay. This followed naturally from the fact that the specific 
rotation of calcium pantothenate was depressed from +27° 
to +22° at this pH. Experiments showed that the rotation 
of d(—)-lactone was not changed at pH more acid than 4. 
A curve then drawn from +22° to —27.5° gave values in good 
agreement with those found by microbiological assay (Table

Application of Method
Under optimum conditions the presence of thiamine, ribo­
flavin, nicotinamide, pyridoxine, or various combinations did 
not obviate application of the method for rapid study of 
stability of pantothenate. In the pH range in which it is most 
stable— i. e., more acid than 6.6— riboflavin has no appreci­
able optical rotatory power. None of the other compounds 
mentioned is optically active.
These studies clearly demonstrate the incompatibility of 
thiamine and pantothenate in aqueous mixtures. Panto­
thenate is most stable in a pH range of about 5.5 to 7. Hy­
drolysis of the molecule occurs at an increasing rate as the pH 
moves away from this range on either the acid or alkaline side. 
Thiamine becomes increasingly less stable at pH more alka­
line than 4, as shown by a large number of independent ex­
periments conducted in this laboratory during the last four 
years.
In presence of air, pyridoxine is oxidized to a colored com­
pound of sufficient intensity to obviate rotation measure­
ments. When oxygen was excluded pyridoxine was found 
to be compatible with pantothenate at neutral pH.
Nicotinamide in concentrations from 2 to 15 per cent had a 
stabilizing effect for pantothenate at pH 7 to 9, but not at 
pH 4 to 5 where it appeared to have a small labilizing effect. 
The effect of thiamine and riboflavin on pantothenate was 
negligible.
Since hydrolysis appeared as the main mechanism of de­
struction of pantothenate, it seemed likely that the molecule 
would resist dry heating up to the point of decomposition.To tost this hypothesis, dry calcium pantothenate was heated 
at 120° for 40 hours. Rotation measurements on the heat- 
treated pantothenate indicated about 12 per cent destruction. 
Since the presence of traces of moisture might account for con­
siderable destruction of pantothenate, a similar experiment was 
run in which the calcium pantothenate was mixed with an equal 
weight of a dehydrating agent—i. e., silica gel or calcium sulfate— 
preliminary to heating. In this experiment no destruction of 
pantothenate occurred, as measured by both the rotation method 
and the microbiological assay method. Further evidence that 
traces of water may react to destroy pantothenate at high tem­
peratures was obtained by mixing calcium pantothenate with an 
equal weight of disodium hydrogen phosphate dodecahydrate 
and heat-treating the mixture as above. About one third of the 
pantothenate was destroyed by this treatment. In presence of 
anhydrous disodium phosphate only 2 to 4 per cent of the original 
pantothenate was lost.
Acidic substances appeared to exert a catalytic destructive 
effect toward pantothenate even when only traces of moisture 
were present. Thus, addition of small amounts of benzoic acid, 
succinic acid, or nicotinamide hydrochloride caused rapid destruc­
tion of admixed calcium pantothenate at 120°.
Calcium pantothenate is moderately hygroscopic and might 
be expected to be somewhat less stable in a humid than in a dry 
atmosphere. Calcium pantothenate samples alone and admixed 
with equal weights of silica gel and calcium sulfate were placed 
in a container together with a vessel from which water could 
evaporate freely and the whole was subjected to 60° for 2 weeks. 
No destruction of pantothenate in presence of either desiccant 
took place as shown by rotation measurement. Destruction of 
pantothenate in absence of a desiccant was slight but detect­
able and was estimated at about 5 per cent of the original.
Discussion
The suggested method for estimation of pantothenate in 
solutions of known chemical content deserves further study 
both to establish the validity of the method and to increase 
its precision. The microbiological assay method of Strong, 
Feeney, and Earle (2) is thought to be accurate to within ±5 
per cent when no interfering substances are present. In most 
instances in this study, values for pantothenate estimated by 
rotation were within ± 5 per cent of those found by the micro­
biological method. The rotation method is thought to be 
precise for simple mixtures at acid pH where lactone forma­
tion parallels the rate of destruction, and is applicable, 
though inherently less accurate, at neutral or alkaline pH 
where no lactone formation occurs. At intermediate pH 
values where correction for incomplete lactone formation is 
needed— i. e., pH 4.5 to 6— the accuracy of the method is 
largely dependent on the accuracy of the correction.
The pH of optimal stability of pantothenate is in the range 
of pH 5.5 to 7, but may vary somewhat, depending on the 
presence of materials which may catalyze hydrolysis. The 
presence of phosphate buffer appeared to catalyze hydrolysis 
of pantothenate (compare Tables I and III). This observa­
tion was confirmed by further studies in which the micro­
biological assay was used exclusively. The presence of elec­
trolytes in general appeared to have slight catalytic effect to­
ward destruction of pantothenate. Stability was not so 
satisfactory in presence of other /3-complex vitamins at neu­
tral or acid pH as in their absence at similar pH. Panto­
thenate in water alone appeared to be stable for 20 days at 
60° at pH 5.5 to 7.
Susceptibility of pantothenate to hydrolytic cleavage in 
the semidry form where only small amounts of moisture are 
concerned was demonstrated in various ways. The rate of 
destruction, just as in solution, was dependent upon effective 
pH. Methods of food drying and processing can be expected 
to have a large effect on the amount of pantothenate de­
stroyed. Rapid and complete drying and storage in the cold 
should yield by far the best results. Destruction of panto­
thenate in natural grain rations for the chick has been re­
ported (S) to occur in 100 hours at 100° or more completely 
in 30 hours at 120°. The amount of water derived from the309 ANALYTICAL EDITION
3 1 0 INDUSTRIAL AND ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY Vol. 15, No. 5
feed mixture is apparently sufficient under these conditions to 
allow cleavage of the pantothenate contained therein. This 
appears as the most likely explanation, since pantothenate 
was found completely stable under even more drastic condi­
tions when kept entirely free from moisture.
Unfortunately, the natural stability of many of the vita­
mins— i. e., thiamine, pyridoxine, and ascorbic acid— is poor 
at the pH of optimal stability of pantothenate. This fact 
deserves careful consideration in the case of pharmaceutical 
preparations and foods where loss of pantothenate is to be 
avoided.
Sum m ary
Pantothenate destruction under ordinary conditions can be 
traced to hydrolysis of the molecule. A method is described 
for following the destruction of calcium d(+)-pantothenate 
by rapid polarimetric analysis.
The rate of pantothenate destruction is a function of pH 
and temperature and is affected also by presence of other 
substances both in aqueous solution and in dry mixtures. 
Optimum stability of pantothenate lies in the approximate 
range, pH 5.5 to 7. The rate of destruction increases as the 
pH moves away from this range. Only traces of water are 
needed to cause significant destruction of pantothenate when 
other conditions favor hydrolysis.
Special significance is attached to the apparent incom­patibility of pantothenate with certain other vitamins, no­
tably thiamine.

Colorimetric Determination of Cobalt  
with o-Nitrosoresorcinol
L Y LE  G. O V E R IIO L S E R  AND JO H N  IT. YOE,
YOE and Barton (0) reported a study of the reaction of /3 -  
nitroso-a-naphthol with'cobalt, including spectrophoto- 
metric data, and found the reaction applicable to the colori­
metric determination of small amounts of cobalt. The main 
disadvantage in using this reagent is due to the insolubility of 
the cobalt complex. The colored suspension tends to precipi­
tate on standing, resulting in a limited stability.
The authors observed that a similar organic compound, o-  
nitrosoresorcinol, also reacts with cobalt and may be advan­
tageously employed as a colorimetric reagent for this element. 
o-Nitrosoresorcinol is slightly less sensitive for cobalt than is 
(S-nitroso-a-naphthol, but solutions of the cobalt complex of o-  
nitrosoresorcinol are stable for several weeks.
Cronheim ( 1) used o-nitrosophenol for the colorimetric 
determination of cobalt, extracting the cobalt complex with 
petroleum ether and measuring the intensity of the colored 
ether fraction. The authors were unable to extract the cobalt 
complex of o-nitrosoresorcinol with any immiscible solvent.
Spectrophotometric data for solutions of o-nitrosoresorcinol, 
the cobalt complex, and the complexes of other metals are 
presented in this paper. A colorimetric method for the deter­
mination of cobalt in the presence of nickel is given.
Apparatus and Materials
Transmittaney measurements wore made with a Beckman 
spectrophotometer, Model D, using a solution thickness of 1  cm. 
and distilled water as a standard.
The visual observations were performed with 50-ml. (220-mm.) 
Nessler tubes.
pH measurements were made with the glass electrode.

C o b a lt. A stock solution containing 1  mg. of cobalt per ml. 
was prepared from c. p. cobalt nitrate hexahydrate. Solutions 
containing 20 or 100 p. p. m. of cobalt, prepared by dilution of the 
stock solution, were used in the experiments.
N ic k e l, c. p. nickel nitrate hexahydrate was purified by 
precipitating, as potassium cobaltinitrite, any cobalt present 
and filtering. The nickel was precipitated as the hydroxide, 
filtered, washed thoroughly, and dissolved in hydrochloric acid. 
The nickel content was determined gravimetrically with di- 
methylglyoxime.
B u ff e r . A buffer solution having a pH of 6.0 was prepared 
by adding 363 ml. of 0.5 M sodium hydroxide to 500 ml. of 0.4 M 
potassium biphthalate and diluting to 1  liter with water. The 
pH of the buffer is practically unchanged when diluted from 25 to 
100 ml.
All other reagents used were of the highest purity obtainable.
Experimental
The usual procedure followed in this work was to transfer the 
desired quantity of cobalt to a 100-ml. volumetric flask, add 25 
ml. of buffer and 5 ml. of the reagent, and dilute to the mark with 
water. After thorough mixing, color comparisons were made in 
Nessler tubes and transmittaney measurements made on another 
portion of the solution.
Using Nessler tubes, 1 part of cobalt in 20,000,000 parts of 
solution may be determined at cobalt concentrations of 0 to 
0.08 mg. per 100 ml.; 1  in 10,000,000 at 0.08 to 0.2 mg.; 1  in
5,000,000 at 0.2 to 0.25 mg. These are also the approximate 
increments to be employed in making up a standard series. 
The spectrophotometer is slightly more sensitive; 1 part of 
cobalt in 50,000,000 of solution may be detected.
Transmittaney curves for solutions of the reagent and of the 
cobalt complex are given in Figure 1. The concentration of 
the reagent must be kept relatively low to prevent a decrease

in the sensitivity for cobalt, because the reagent is highly 
colored and absorbs strongly in the same spectral region as the 
cobalt complex. The reaction rate, however, is prohibitively 
slow at very low reagent concentrations. The concentration 
of reagent recommended, 2.5 mg. per 100 ml., results in im­
mediate color formation and also permits the determination of 
small amounts of cobalt.
The maximum amount of cobalt determinable is limited by 
the relatively small amount of reagent employed. No increase 
in intensity occurs if the quantity of cobalt present exceeds 
0.26 mg. with 2.5 mg. of reagent. These quantities corre­
spond to a molar ratio of reagent to cobalt of slightly greater 
than 3 to 1. This indicates that the compound formed is an 
inner complex of nitrosoresorcinol and the cobaltic ion, similar 
to that obtained with /3-nitroso-a-naphthol.
The maximum difference between the transmittancy of 
solutions of the reagent and of the cobalt complex occurs at a 
wave band of 420 to 430 m/i at low cobalt concentrations. 
Most of the measurements were made in this region. A wave 
length of 450 m/x may be advantageously used for cobalt con­
centrations above 0.15 mg. per 100 ml. The validity of Beer’s 
law at 430 and 450 m/j. is shown in Figure 2.
E f f e c t  o f  pH. The color of the reagent varies markedly 
with the pH of the solution. Below pH 2.5 it has a pale green­
ish-yellow color which increases in intensity and becomes 
orange as the pH increases from 2.5 to 5.6. From 5.6 to 6.5 
little change in the intensity occurs, but it increases slightly 
at 7.0. A further increase in pH results in a slight decrease in 
intensity. The transmittancy curves of solutions of the 
reagent at various pH ’s are given in Figure 3. No break in 
the curve at a wave length of 440 mju is observable at a pH of
4.0.
The pH also influences the intensity of the red color of the 
cobalt complex. No visible reaction occurs below a pH of 2.0. 
The intensity of the color increases from 2.0 to 5.6, is practi­cally constant from 5.6 to 6.3, and decreases slightly with in­
creasing pH above 6.5. A pH of 6.0 was employed in all 
experiments, although the method is applicable at a pH 
range of 5.6 to 6.5. Figure 4 shows the transmittancy curves 
of solutions of the cobalt complex at various pH ’s.
To afford increased buffer capacity, the concentration of 
the buffer may be increased without any effect on the intensity 
of the color. A biphthalate-sodium hydroxide buffer was 
employed in preference to a phosphate or citrate buffer be­
cause the presence of phosphate or citrate causes a decrease 
in the intensity of the color of the cobalt complex.
The rate of reaction is dependent on the pH of the solution, 
being slower at a pH of less than 5.6 than above this value. 
The reaction occurs practically instantaneously at a pH of
6.0 and above.
S t a b ilit y . Solutions of the cobalt complex are stable for 
at least a month. The transmittancy, at 450 m/i, of a solu­
tion containing 0.15 mg. of cobalt was 0.128 when prepared 
and remained unchanged for a month. The transmittancy of 
solutions of the reagent changes slightly on long aging—  
for example, the transmittancy at 450 m/j. increased from 0.488 
to 0.510 after a month. The transmittancy increases slightly 
at wave lengths less than 500 m/x but decreases at longer wave 
lengths on aging. Visually, solutions of the reagent fade 
slightly on long aging in the buffer or aqueous medium.
In t e r f e r e n c e . In these studies the usual procedure was 
followed but the ion in question was added prior to the addi­
tion of the reagent. Observations were made in the absence 
of cobalt and at a cobalt concentration of 1  p. p. m.

cliloride had no effect on the transmittancy of the solutions 
at 430 raju. Visually, the presence of more than 1 gram of 
ammonium chloride produced a green tint. All the other 
salts cause a similar off shade of color on standing. However, 
if the color comparisons are made within an hour the salts 
cause no interference. The concentration of various ions 
that may be present without interference is given in Table I.Cadmium.  A solution of the cadmium complex gives a trans­
mittancy curve similar to that for zinc, as seen in Figure 5. 
Visually, a cadmium concentration of 100 p. p. m. causes no inter­
ference; 1000 p. p. m. of cadmium cause no interference if the 
transmittancy measurements are made at a wave band of 425 m^. 
The measurements may be made immediately, since this high 
cadmium concentration does not decrease the reaction rate of 
cobalt with the reagent. The cadmium concentration must be 
limited to approximately 1000 p. p. m. to avoid possible precipita­
tion of the hydroxide.
Palladium.  The transmittancy curve for a solution of the 
palladous complex given in Figure 5 is similar to that for the co­
balt complex. The intensity of the colored palladous complex at 
low concentrations is almost as great as that of the cobalt com­
pound. The reagent is not recommended for palladium, how­
ever, because the complex is slow in forming and the colored solu­
tions are not stable after the complex has formed. Palladium 
must be absent to avoid interference.
Iron. The reagent reacts with ferric ions, giving a green solu­
tion at a concentration as low as 0.1 p. p. m. The use of citrate or 
tartrate does not completely eliminate this interference. The in­
tensity of the colored solution increases and the transmittancy 
decreases slowly on aging. The interference due to iron can be 
eliminated by precipitating the ferric iron with potassium fluoride 
and filtering. Unfortunately, some of the ferric salts, from differ­
ent sources, contained an unidentified interfering substance. 
Solutions prepared from ferric nitrate nonahydrate or ferric 
ammonium sulfate dodecahydrate caused no interference, visually 
or spectrophotometrically. Those prepared from ferric chloride 
hexahydrate or iron wire did interfere, producing slightly darker 
colored solutions than obtained in the absence of iron. This 
interference could be eliminated by purifying the iron salts before 
use.
The reagent is not recommended for cobalt if iron is present, 
because it is impossible to know whether or not the interfering 
substance accompanies the iron. The results obtained, however, 
do show that a clean-cut separation of cobalt from iron is possible 
by precipitating the iron as the complex fluoride—for example, 
no cobalt is lost when the iron is precipitated from a solution con­
taining 500 mg. of iron and 0.05 mg. of cobalt, a ratio of 10,000 to 1.

The interference of the other common metals is considered 
in more detail in the following sections.
Copper.  The cupric ion reacts with o-nitrosoresorcinol, giving 
a complex that is nearly as intense in color as that with cobalt. 
From the transmittancy curve for a solution of the copper com­
plex (Figure 5) it is evident that no wave band may be employed 
that will eliminate the interference of the cupric ion. The 
technique used for determining cobalt in the presence of nickel, 
described below, is not applicable for copper. Apparently, the 
complex formed with the cupric ion is more stable than that with 
nickel. The quantity of copper present must not exceed 0.01 to 
0.02 mg. in either the visual or spectrophotometric methods.
Zinc. The transmittancy curve for the zinc complex is given 
in Figure 5. The reagent is not sensitive for zinc, a concentration 
of 20 p. p. m. not interfering in the yisual method. A zinc 
concentration of 1000 p. p. m. causes no interference, if the 
transmittancy measurements are made at a wave band of 420 nifi. 
The high zinc concentration does cause a decrease in the rate of 
formation of the cobalt complex. Thus, at a zinc concentration 
of 1000 p. p. m. it is necessary to allow the solutions to stand 3 to 4 
hours before making the measurements if the cobalt concentration 
is 1  p. p. m. At lower cobalt or zinc concentrations a shorter 
period of time is required. No evidence of the precipitation of 
zinc hydroxide was observed, even at a zinc concentration of 5000

shows that at no wave band may the interference of nickel be 
effectively eliminated. The nickel concentration would have 
to be limited to 0.5 p. p. m., if this interference could not be 
eliminated by some method.
Using a constant cobalt concentration, the intensity of the 
color increases with increasing nickel concentration up to 
approximately 10 p. p. m. The intensity is less immediately 
after adding the reagent at higher nickel concentrations but 
increases on standing until the intensity is the same as at 10 
p. p. m. This is understandable, if it is remembered that the 
total intensity of the color is the sum of that of the cobalt and 
nickel complexes and that the intensity of the cobalt complex 
is greater than that of the nickel at the same concentration. 
At the lower nickel concentrations, the cobalt complex forms 
immediately and any reagent in excess of that required for 
the cobalt forms the nickel complex simultaneously. At the 
higher nickel concentrations, however, the formation of the 
nickel complex is favored, but since the cobalt complex is more 
stable than the nickel complex a slow shift from the nickel to 
the cobalt complex occurs, resulting in the increase in the color 
intensity on standing.
The transmittancy of solutions of the nickel complex is 
practically independent of the nickel concentration, if the 
latter is above 10 p. p. m. This indicates that the concentra­
tion of nickel does not have to be controlled carefully, pro­
viding the concentration is above 10 p. p. m. The reaction 
rate, between the cobalt and reagent, however, decreases with 
increasing nickel concentration, thereby setting a practical 
limit to the amount of nickel that may be present.
An increase in the concentration of the reagent increases 
the reaction rate but results in a decrease in the sensitivity. 
This difficulty is avoided if the volume of the solution is kept 
below 50 ml. during the aging period and diluted to 100 ml. 
before making the measurements. The aging is carried out at 
approximately 100° C., because the reaction rate also increaseswith increasing temperature. Results of experimentation are 
given in the following procedure:

N icke l. Transfer the test solution to a 100-ml. Erlcnmeyer 
flask, and add 25 ml. of buffer and,5 ml. of reagent. Heat on a 
steam or water bath for a period of time depending upon the 
cobalt and nickel concentration present. Cool, transfer quantita­
tively to a 100-ml. volumetric flask, and dilute to the mark with 
water.
Using 5 mg. of nickel 2 hours of heating are required for a final 
cobalt concentration of 1  p. p. m.; 3 hours for 1.5 p. p. m. With
10 mg. of nickel 4 hours are required for 1  p. p. m. of cobalt; 6 
hours for 1.5 p. p. m. For 15 mg. of rjickel 6 hours arc required 
for 1  p. p. m.; 10 hours for 1.5 p. p. m! of cobalt. A longer time 
is required if the volume of the solution is greater than 40 ml. 
during the heating period. It is impractical for the nickel con­
centration to cxcced 150 p. p. m. and the cobalt concentration
1.5 p. p. m.
The use of a spectrophotometer is recommended. With this 
instrument it is possible to detect 0.002 mg. of cobalt in the pres­
ence of 10 mg. of nickel—i. e., 0.02 per cent of cobalt.
Some transmittancy values for mixtures of cobalt and nickel 
are given in Table II.
Additional results are shown in Figure 2 for various cobalt 
concentrations in the presence of 5 mg. of nickel. Beer’s 
law is valid, although the lines have origins different from 
those obtained in the absence of nickel.
The visual method is applicable if appropriate amounts of 
nickel are present in the standards and the standards are 
heated for the proper periods of time. Visually, the method 
is slightly less sensitive for cobalt in the presence of nickel, 
owing to the increased intensity of the colored solutions.
The effect of potassium fluoride on the method was studied 
briefly in connection with the possible determination of cobalt 
in solutions also containing nickel and iron. The presence of 
potassium fluoride decreases the color intensity of the nickel 
complex, especially on heating. The aging can be carried out 
at room temperature, however, since the presence of potassium 
fluoride increases the reaction rate of the cobalt and reagent. 
The visual method is not applicable to mixtures of cobalt,and 
nickel if potassium fluoride is present, but spectrophotometric 
measurements made at 450 m^u are satisfactory.

Sum m ary
A study of the reaction between cobalt and o-nitrosore- 
sorcinol has shown that the reagent may be used for the colori­
metric determination of cobalt. Spectrophotometric data for 
solutions of the reagent, for the cobalt complex, and for other 
metal complexes are presented. Procedures are given for 
the determination of cobalt alone and for cobalt in mixtures 
of nickel and cobalt.

Polarographic Determination o f Formaldehyde  
in Biological Material
Application to the Determination of Serine
M . JO H N  BO YD AND K A R L  BAM BACII, College of M edicine, University of C incinnati, C incinnati, Ohio
FO RM A LD EH YD E has been determined quantitatively 
by the polarograph according to Jahoda (3), Winkel and 
Proske ( 5), and Barnes and Speicher (i). Recently Boyd 
and Logan (2) have developed a colorimetric method for the 
determination of formaldehyde as a step in the procedure for 
estimating serine. Their method consists essentially of 
quantitatively separating by distillation the formaldehyde 
resulting from the action of periodate on protein hydrolyzates 
containing serine, and condensing this formaldehyde with 
chromotropic acid (Eegrewe’s reagent) to form a colored 
compound.

In order to ascertain whether the polarograph can be used 
to determine the formaldehyde found in the distillate in the 
above procedure, the authors compared polarographic 
analyses against those run colorimetri- 
cally. The polarographic procedure proved 
suitable for this type of determination, 
since no substances which interfered with 
the production of smooth current-voltage 
curves came over in the distillation.
Procedure
The formaldehyde is separated from the 
protein hydrolyzate and the periodate re­
action mixture by distillation, as described 
by Boyd and Logan (2). Three milliliters 
of the distillate are mixed with 1  ml. of a 
solution of electrolytes (0.4 N potassium 
chloride, 0.2 N potassium hydroxide), and 
nitrogen is bubbled through the mixture for 
3 minutes. This does not result in loss of 
formaldehyde, since repeated runs on the same 
solution showed that gassing for as long as 
15 minutes did not change the height of the 
step. The polarogram of the solution is 
then taken from —1.4 to —1.8 volts with 
the Leeds & Northrup Electro-chemograph;the half-wave of the formaldehyde step occurs at about 
—  1.63 volts (normal calomel electrode). Accurate temperature 
control is important; a constant-temperature water bath thermo­
statically controlled to 0.1° C. was used.
The authors’ results confirm Barnes and Speicher’s findings {1) 
that the wave height changes about 6.5 per cent for each 1° C. 
change in the temperature of the solution. The height of the 
step is measured in the usual way and compared with a calibration 
curve made with known quantities of formaldehyde at the same 
temperature and drop rate, and with the same capillary.
Discussion
The results obtained by the polarographic method agree 
with those obtained by the colorimetric method of Boyd and 
Logan (2) as shown in Table I. Quantities of formaldehyde 
as low as 3 micrograms per ml. of distillate can be determine^ 
by the polarographic procedure.
According to Barnes and Speicher, when potassium hy­
droxide is the only supporting electrolyte, the full height of the 
formaldehyde step is not given in concentrations of potassium 
hydroxide below 0.5 per cent, and so those workers used 1.25 
per cent solutions in their determinations. In the authors’ 
experience, satisfactory curves with the full height of the 
formaldehyde wave are obtained with 0.05 N potassium 
hydroxide in 0.1 N potassium chloride, so that it is not neces­
sary to employ stronger alkali, thereby decreasing the possi­
bility of condensation of the formaldehyde.
Acetaldehyde (which arises from the action of periodate on 
threonine, 4) does not interfere in the analysis unless it is 
present in extremely large amounts, since it is not reduced 
until a potential of —1.8 volts is reached (Figure 1). This 
method cannot be used for the determination of small amounts 
of acetaldehyde unless the potassium ion in the supporting 
electrolyte is replaced by lithium, because the potassium wave 
interferes with that of acetaldehyde. However, good results 
can be obtained with acetaldehyde in lithium hydroxide. 
Other aldehydes, higher in the aliphatic series, are reduced at 
still higher voltages.

This method need not be limited to the determination of 
formaldehyde liberated by the action of periodate on serine. 
It can probably be applied to the determination of formalde­
hyde in other types of samples; as long as the compound can 
be isolated by distillation, reasonably free from interfering 
substances, it can be estimated polarographically.Literature Cited

Determination o f Small Amounts of Molybdenum  
in Tungsten and Molybdenum Ores
F. S. G R IM A L D I AND R . C. W E LL S, Geological Survey, U. S. Departm ent of the Interior, W ashington, D. C.
A rapid m ethod has been developed for 
the determ ination of small am ounts of 
m olybdenum  in  tungsten and m olybdenum  
ores. After removing iron and other m ajor 
constituents the m olybdenum  tliiocyanate 
color is developed in watcr-acetone solu­
tions, using am m o nium  citrate to elim i­
nate the in  terferen ce of tungs ten. Compari­
son is made by titrating a blank w ith a 
standard m olybdenum  solution. Aliquots 
are adjusted to deal w ith am ounts of 
m olybdenum  ranging from 0.01 to 1.30 mg.
MOST of the calcium tungstate ores from contact-meta- 
morphic deposits in the western states contain at 
least a trace of molybdenum, and in many such ores as much 
as 0.5 per cent of molybdenum may be present. As concen­
trates from such ores are subject to a penalty, the determina­
tion of molybdenum is important.
In its search for new supplies of the different strategic 
metals the U. S. Geological Survey has examined various 
samples of possible molybdenum content that were on the 
border line between a little and no molybdenum. For such 
work a quick but accurate method was needed. One method 
developed for this purpose is based on fluorescence ( 1); the 
other depends on chemical analysis and colorimetric estima­
tion of the molybdenum.
The amber color developed by molybdenum, thiocyanate, 
and a reducing agent has long been used as a sensitive test 
for molybdenum, the colored complex usually being concen­
trated by extraction with organic solvents such as ether, 
butyl acetate, or cyclohexanol, before colorimetric estima­
tion. Ether, the most common solvent employed, has several 
objections, as noted by Sandell (5). The authors have found 
that even a few milligrams of tungsten or vanadium cause 
high results with the ether extraction alone, unless tartrate 
or citrate is present. Hurd and Allen (S) studied the condi­
tions for maximum stability of color, using various solvents, 
and stated that “butyl acetate, although an excellent solvent 
for the thiocyanate, should be used with care. The color 
produced by a given concentration of molybdenum appears 
to depend to no slight extent upon the manner in which the 
solvent has been saturated w r ith the reagents.” They re­
ported that cyclohexanol is difficult to handle, separates 
slowly from aqueous solution, and may develop a turbidity.The writers dispense with extractions altogether, but em­
ploy an acetone-water solution, as acetone appears to have a 
stabilizing action and prevents fluctuations of the color with 
time. The interference of tungsten is eliminated by the use of 
ammonium citrate.
The essential features of the procedure are that the molyb­
denum thiocyanate color is developed in a water-acetone 
solution and the comparison is made by titrating a blank 
containing the necessary reagents with a standard molyb­
denum solution.
Reagents
S ta n n o u s  C h lo r id e  (10 P e r  C e n t). Dissolve 20 grams of 
stannous chloride dihydrate in 100 ml. of concentrated hydro­
chloric acid and 100 ml. of water.
A m m onium  T h io c y a n a te  (10 P e r  C e n t). Dissolve 20 grams 
in 200 ml. of water.
A m m onium  C itr a t e , reagent grade.
A c e to n e , reagent grade.
S ta n d a r d  M o ly b d e n u m  S o lu tio n . 1  ml. = 0.1 mg. of 
molybdenum trioxide. Dissolve 0.1 gram of pure molybdenum 
trioxide in a little sodium hydroxide, neutralize to litmus with 
hydrochloric acid, and make up to 1  liter in a volumetric flask. 
As the standard degenerates with time, it is necessary to make up 
a fresh solution every month.
Solution of Sample
With substances like scheelite that contain up to 40 per cent 
of tungstic oxide and possibly as much as 1  per cent of molyb­
denum oxide, fuse in platinum 0.5 gram of the sample with
2.5 grams of sodium carbonate and about 0.05 gram of sodium 
nitrate {2). Begin the heating at a low temperature and gradu­
ally increase the heat until a homogeneous melt is obtained. 
Extract the cooled melt with water containing a drop of alcohol 
to reduce manganate, add a little paper pulp, filter, and wash 
with warm 1  per cent sodium carbonate solution. Make just 
acid with hydrochloric acid. If any chromate is present, reduce 
it with a little sulfurous acid. Evaporate to about 23 ml. on the 
steam bath to remove carbon dioxide. At this point silica may 
separate out. Without removing silica neutralize with 10 per 
cent sodium hydroxide and add 10 ml. in excess, add a little paper 
pulp, and digest on the bath about 10 minutes. Filter hot and 
wash with dilute sodium hydroxide. Add phcnolphthalein to the 
filtrate, make it barely acid with hydrochloric acid, and transfer 
it to a 100-ml. volumetric flask. The solution is now ready for the 
estimation of molybdenum.
With molybdenite ores, wulfenite ores, and ores high in silica, 
in which tungsten is low, an acid attack of the sample is prefer­
able. The usual practice ( 6) involves treatment with nitric 
and sulfuric acids and eventual extraction of the molybdenum in 
a sulfuric acid solution. On a 0.5-gram sample, 2 ml. of sulfuric 
acid are sufficient.
Colorimetric Estim ation of M olybdenum
Take a 15-ml. aliquot of the neutral molybdenum solution in a 
100-ml. beaker; if a larger or smaller aliquot is taken, adjust 
volume to 15 ml. Add to the solution at room temperature 1.5
grams of ammonium citrate and stir until it is dissolved. Now 
add 5 ml. of 10 per cent ammonium thiocyanate and 25 ml. of 
acetone, cool, add dropwise by pipet exactly 7 ml. of stannous 
chloride solution, and stir. Accurate measurement is impor­
tant, as the acidity of the solution is controlled by the quantity of 
stannous chloride added. This develops the amber color of the 
molybdenum thiocyanate. To a blank in another 100-ml. 
beaker add 15 ml. of water, 1.5 grams of ammonium citrate, 5 ml. 
of ammonium thiocyanate, and 25 ml. of acetone. Add by pipet 
exactly 7 ml. of stannous chloride solution. Titrate this blank to 
a color match by adding standard molybdenum solution from a 
buret.
Occasionally the unknown will precipitate silica on the addi­
tion of stannous chloride, especially if the addition is too rapid. 
If this occurs, filter off the silica at this point before matching the 
color.
Results w ith Known Mixtures
In the experimental work accurately measured quantities of 
solutions of known titer, containing the sodium salts of the ele­
ments in question, were transferred to 100-ml. beakers. The solu­
tions were adjusted to 15 ml. and made just acid before the addi­
tion of the reagents used for the development of the color. Esti­
mations were made by titrating blanks with standard molyb­
denum solution.
Table I lists the results obtained in the presence of tung­
sten. The color is stable in the presence of tungsten for at 
least 3 hours.3 1 6  INDUSTRIAL AND E N

Interference
Iron causes a serious positive error and must be removed 
completely. The error is not so much a function of the 
quantity of iron present as of the time elapsed before the 
sample is matched. Table II illustrates this interference of 
iron when the solution is matched immediately. Table II I  
shows the interference as a function of time.
Iron as well as many other interfering bases is, however, 
removed at the start by the carbonate fusion. Small or mod­
erate amounts of iron are further removed with sodium hy­
droxide as described in the procedure. Excess ammonium 
hydroxide may be substituted for sodium hydroxide but the 
digestion is best conducted in a stoppered Erlenmeyer flask. 
In four experiments, 0.05,0.30,1.00, and 50.0 mg. of iron in the 
presence of 0.3 gram of tungstic oxide were completely re­
moved by this method. Phosphate causes no interference 
when tungsten is absent. W ith tungsten present the color 
fades and turns blue-green with time. If matched within
10 minutes, 20 mg. of phosphorus pentoxide in the final ali­
quot with 0.3 gram of tungstic oxide show negligible inter­
ference. With 0.1 gram of tungstic oxide, 80 mg. of phos­
phorus pentoxide cause little trouble during this 10-minute 
interval. The interference of phosphate may be minimized 
by using more ammonium citrate.
Large amounts of vanadium interfere because of the blue- 
green color of vanadium in reduced solutions. Amounts of 
vanadium up to 2 mg. of vanadium trioxide in the final ali­
quot, however, do not appreciably affect the molybdenumINEERING CHEMISTRY Vol. 15, No. 5

K. J. Murata of this laboratory prepared pure synthetic mem­
bers of the scheelite-powellite mineral series by the method of 
Michel (.4), and these were analyzed for molybdenum. The 
ground samples were attacked by 10 ml. of hydrochloric acid and
2 drops of nitric acid, evaporated to dryness, and taken up with
1.5 grams of ammonium citrate and 4 drops of ammonium hy­
droxide. The color was then developed and compared.
The results, as indicated in Table IV, showed good agree­
ment with the synthetics.

Quantitative Estimation of Acetyl in  
Carbohydrate Acetates
R O Y  L. W H IST L E R  AND A LLEN E JEA N ES, Starch and Dextrose Division, Northern Regional Research Laboratory,
Peoria.
METHODS for the quantitative determination of carbo­
hydrate acetyl have been developed principally along 
two separate lines: (1) for the simple sugar acetates which 
require the use of mild conditions to prevent errors which 
might arise from the destruction of the labile carbohydrate 
molecules; (2) for cellulose acetates which, because of the 
heterogeneous reaction involved, require somewhat more 
drastic conditions or considerably extended reaction time. 
Separate, essentially noninterchangeable methods were, 
therefore, evolved for the two classes of carbohydrate deriva­
tives. Adaptations of the aforementioned methods have been 
applied to starch acetates, but none appears to have received 
general acceptance.
This paper describes a quantitative method of acetyl analysis 
which is applicable not only to the polysaccharide acetates of 
starch and cellulose but, on slight modification, to the simple 
sugar acetates as well. The method employs the sodium 
methoxide catalyst of Zemplén (7) to transesterify carbohy­
drate acetyl in methanol with the production of methyl acetate 
which is then quantitatively removed and determined by a 
modification of the well-known Freudenberg (2) procedure. 
Starch and cellulose do not yield volatile acidic decomposi­
tion products on contact with alkaline catalyst during the

separation of the methyl acetate by distillation. The lower 
sugars, being labile, are decomposed on boiling in the presence 
of the catalyst. Therefore, in these cases, the transestéri­
fication is accomplished at room temperature, and the catalyst 
is neutralized by the addition of a methanol solution of sul­
furic acid before proceeding with the distillation.
The transestérification is rapid, requiring only 15 minutes 
at room temperature, for acetates of the simple carbohydrates. 
Even in the case of polysaccharide acetates, which remain 
insoluble, the reaction is completed in about 25 minutes. 
In certain instances with dense or somewhat horny acetates 
the reaction proceeds slowly. In these cases it is expedient 
first to swell the acetate by heating in methanol for 0.5 to 1  
hour before proceeding with the analysis.
The apparatus employed for the analysis is a modification 
of the Freudenberg {2) apparatus as shown in Figure 1.
Analytical Procedure
R e a g e n ts . Anhydrous methanol was prepared by drying 
methanol with magnesium methoxide (4) and distilling through a 
fractionating column.
Sodium methoxide was prepared by dissolving clean sodium in 
anhydrous methanol. The sodium was cut under xylene to ex­
pose fresh surfaces and weighed. It was then rapidly passed 
through three separate portions of anhydrous methanol contained 
in beakers and finally dissolved in anhydrous methanol in a 
volumetric flask and made up to volume. Approximately 0.2 N 
solutions were employed.
An approximately 0.2 N solution of sulfuric acid in methanol 
was prepared by adding a calculated amount of concentrated 
sulfuric acid to anhydrous methanol and allowing the mixture to 
stand several days to permit formation of monomethyl sulfate. 
The solution was then standardized and was found to maintain 
its normality for a considerable time.
P ro c e d u re  f o r  P o ly s a c c h a rid e  A ce ta te s. A 0 2- to 0.3- 
gram sample of finely divided polysaccharide acetate; previously 
dried in vacuo over phosphorus pentoxide, is placed in 20 ml. of 
anhydrous methanol in the reaction flask (C, Figure 1), containing 
a boiling tube to prevent bumping. Approximately 5 to 10 ml. 
of 0.2 N sodium methoxide (3 to 8 milliequivalents per gram of 
sample) in anhydrous methanol are added through the dropping 
funnel, B, which is protected by a small drying tube, A. The 
temperature of the water bath, G, is raised until slow distillation 
into the receiving flask, E, occurs, the rate of distillation being 
approximately 35 drops per minute. During the distillation, the 
receiving flask is cooled by immersion in crushed ice. The re­
ceiving flask may be protected by a small tube, F, filled with soda 
lime. When the liquid in the distillation flask has been concen­
trated to a small volume (approximately 5 ml.) a fresh 20-ml. 
portion of anhydrous methanol is admitted through the dropping 
funnel and the solution is again distilled to a small volume. Two 
10-ml. portions of anhydrous methanol are then added succes­
sively and the solution is concentrated to a small volume after 
the addition of each portion. During the concentration the 
water level in the water bath is maintained just below the level 
of liquid in the distillation flask in order to prevent baking of 
material on the flask walls.
After the final concentration, the distillation flask is removed or 
the stopcock on dropping tube B is opened, and 25 ml. of 0.2 N 
sodium hydroxide are pipetted into the receiving flask by way of 
the side neck and the neck closed by a glass stopper. The bath,
H, of crushed ice is removed and a hot water bath substituted. 
The contents of the receiving flask are refluxed 15 minutes, the 
flask is cooled, 75 ml. of boiled distilled water are added, and the 
excess sodium hydroxide is titrated with 0.1 N hydrochloric acid 
to a phenolphthalein end point. The base consumed in the 
saponification, minus that consumed in a separate blank deter­
mination, is equivalent to the acetyl content of the carbohydrate 
acetate. Blank determinations are made by refluxing 50 ml. of
318 INDUSTRIAL AND ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY Vol. 15. No. 5
methanol 15 minutes with 25 ml. of 0.2 N sodium hydroxide and 
titrating as described above.
It is not necessary that the catalyst remain in the reaction mix­
ture throughout the distillation. After the first concentration of 
the liquid in the distillation flask the catalyst may be neutralized 
or the solution slightly acidified by addition of sulfuric acid dis­
solved in methanol, and the remainder of the distillation carried 
out as described. This procedure causes no change in the ob­
served acetyl value. Samples not in a state of fine subdivision are 
refluxed with methanol for 0.5 to 1  hour before introducing the 
catalyst and proceeding with the analysis. For the reflux, water 
is circulated through condenser D but at all other times this 
condenser remains empty.
P ro c e d u re  f o r  S im ple S u g a r A c e ta te s . A  0.20- to 0.25-
§ram sample of sugar acetate is added to the reaction flask and 
issolved in 20 ml. of anhydrous methanol by gentle heating. 
When complete solution has occurred the mixture is cooled to 
room temperature, and 5 to 10 ml. of 0.2 N sodium methoxide in 
anhydrous methanol are added and well mixed with the solution. 
After 15 minutes, slightly more of a solution of sulfuric acid in 
methanol is added than is needed to neutralize the catalyst. The 
methyl acetate is then quantitatively distilled and determined as 
described in the procedure for polysaccharide acetates. The 
sample may be left in contact with the catalyst for periods longer 
than 15 minutes without affecting the results. The equilibrium 
effected by the catalyst apparently produces methyl acetate to 
the almost complete exclusion of carbohydrate acetate.
Discussion
Since the presence of sodium hydroxide in the solution 
would tend to prevent quantitative transestérification and 
distillation of the methyl acetate, it is important that water 
be carefully excluded from the reaction flask and that dry 
samples and anhydrous reagents be employed.
The amount of catalyst employed need not be precisely 
controlled. A several-fold variation in the ratio of catalyst to 
sample may be used without detriment to the analytical re­
sults. In general, 3 to 8 milliequivalents of catalyst per gram 
of sample were employed. Barium methoxide gives good 
results with the simple sugar acetates, but is not so effective 
with the polysaccharide acetates as is sodium methoxide.
Methanol is used in preference to ethanol because of the 
more favorable distillation of methyl acetate from a solution 
in methanol as compared to ethyl acetate from ethanol.
Results are reproducible to about ±0.1 per cent acetyl—  
for example, the value reported in Table I for cornstarch 
acetate I  represents the mean value of 18 determinations all 
values of which were within ±0.2 per cent of the mean value 
and 15 results were within ±0.1 per cent. The accuracy of the 
results is good in the case of the lower sugar acetates. Since 
no method exists for definitely establishing the acetyl content 
of starch and cellulose acetates, the accuracy of the results 
in the case of these polysaccharides cannot be precisely deter­
mined. For this reason it was of interest to compare the 
values obtained for the polysaccharide acetates with values 
obtained by the use of a previously widely used procedure. 
The methods in the literature, applying principally to the 
determination of acetyl or combined acetic acid in cellulose 
acetates, have been comprehensively reviewed and criticized 
by several workers (S, 6, 6).  The method recommended 
(3, 6) as giving the most reliable results is a modification of 
the method of Eberstadt ( 1), which consists in saponification 
of the acetate in standard alkali and subsequent titration of 
the excess alkali with acid.
Values obtained from quadruplicate determinations by 
this method were compared with values resulting from the 
sodium methoxide procedure. In general, the results ob­
tained by the two methods were in good agreement (Table I). 
In  several cases, however, the modified Eberstadt method 
gave acetyl percentages 0.2 to 0.4 higher than the values 
obtained by the sodium methoxide procedure. In these in­
stances, a blank run on the unacetylated starches showed that 
the samples possessed an acidity equivalent to 0.2 to 0.4 
per cent acetyl. Acidic groups may result from the presenceof fats, phosphoric acid residues, or carboxyl groups produced 
by partial oxidation of the carbohydrate. Correction for 
these acidities brought the results into agreement with those 
of the sodium methoxide procedure. Acetyl values which 
were thus corrected are indicated in Table I. Since cornstarch 
acetate I I I  was a commercial product and none of the un­
acetylated starch was available, correction of the acetyl value 
for acidic contaminants could not readily be made. This 
acetate was impure, as indicated by its brown color. In 
contrast to the Eberstadt method, the sodium methoxide 
procedure is not affected by the presence of nonvolatile acidic 
contaminants such as fats and phosphoric acid residues or by 
the existence of free carboxyl groups resulting from oxidation 
of the polysaccharide.

Attempts to adapt the Freudenberg procedure (2) to poly­
saccharide acetates were not entirely successful. The slow­
ness of the p-toluenesulfonic acid to cause transestérification 
required long reflux periods which resulted in abnormally 
large blank values. However, when the proper blanks were 
subtracted the acetyl values were in rough agreement with 
those indicated in Table I.
Sum m ary
A method is reported for the quantitative estimation of 
acetyl in either polysaccharide acetates or simple sugar ace­
tates. The acetates are transesterified by sodium methoxide 
catalyst in anhydrous methanol to yield methyl acetate, 
which is quantitatively distilled, and saponified in standard 
alkali. The method is rapid, gives reproducible results, and 
possesses the advantage of yielding acetyl values which are not 
affected by the presence of nonvolatile acidic groups in the 
sample.

Estimation of Volatile Acyl Groups in  
Cellulose Esters

Massachusetts Institu te of Technology, Cambridge, Mass.
GENUNG and Mallatt (4) not only reviewed the literature 
of this important estimation but also submitted the 
principal method, that of Ost, to a critical experimental study. 
In this method, the cellulose ester is completely dissolved in 
cold, aqueous sulfuric acid (1 to 1), the solution containing 
the liberated organic acid, or acids, is distilled with steam, and 
the acidity of the distillate is found by titration.
During the past five years (i), several operators in this 
laboratory have obtained reliable and concordant analyses for 
the volatile acyl content of various cellulose esters by the 
following procedure, which is based on the work of Zemplén 
(£?), Perkin (7), Freudenberg and Harder (2), and particularly 
Phillips (5). The acyl groups are recovered as methyl esters 
by a transestérification in methanol, with sodium methylate 
followed by excess p-toluenesulfonic acid as catalysts. 
Since the lower methyl esters are more volatile in methanol 
than the free acids are in steam, a short distillation, instead 
of the rather tedious one characteristic of the Ost process, 
transfers the esters to the distillate. This distillate is 
trapped in an excess of standard aqueous alkali. Saponi­
fication, removal of excess methanol by distillation, and 
titration of the residual aqueous solution complete the esti­
mation.
Experimental
M a te ria ls . Pure, dry methanol, free from aldehydes and 
acids, was prepared by heating the commercial c. p. grade under 
reflux for 6 hours with a few grams per liter of clean magnesium 
ribbon. Pellets of sodium hydroxide, mixed with clean aluminum 
turnings, could also be used. The methanol recovered by distilla­
tion in all-glass equipment was stored in glass-stoppered bottles.
If the purity of the commercial p-toluenesulfonic acid hy­
drate was doubted, the aqueous solution was filtered through 
absorbent charcoal and steam-distilled until the distillate was 
no longer acid (8). When crystallization from the highly con­
centrated still residue was complete, the crystals were recovered 
and were dried in vacuo over concentrated sulfuric acid. The 
stock solution contained equal weights of water and of the sul­
fonic acid hydrate.
Aqueous caustic soda, 0.2 2 V , and sulfuric acid, 0.1 N, were 
standardized against a National Bureau of Standards sample of 
acid potassium phthalate. The sodium methylate solution was 
prepared by dissolving the clean metal in the purified methanol 
ana the normality was adjusted to 0.1 N after titrating an ali­
quot with standard acid.
A pparatus. The apparatus was a modification of that used by 
Phillips ( 8) and was constructed entirely of Pyrex. Soft glass 
and rubber were avoided lest alkali from the former, or traces of 
hydrogen sulfide from the latter, reduce the accuracy of the 
estimation.
The 250-cc. round-bottomed flask, A, was sealed, as shown 
in Figure 1, to a 35-cc. dropping funnel and a No. 11 ground-glass 
joint. The joint fitted the similar one on the bottom of the 40- 
cm. (16-inch), vertical Liebig condenser, B, the top of which was 
sealed to the top of the similar condenser, E, through a horizontal 
tube about 20 cm. in length. An inverted 25-cc. Erlenmeyer 
flask at the bottom of E acted as a trap in case of a suck-back 
during distillation, and the exit, D, was sealed through a No. 20 
ground joint. This joint fitted the one on the neck of the 
ellipsoidal receiver, C, which was blown from a 500-cc. round- 
bottomed flask. Powdered glass was fused inside the lower

tillations. When the receiver was attached to the exit tube, D, 
in the position shown, the end of the tube remained above the 
level or the liquid in C. Rotation of the latter through 180° 
about the glass joint caused the end of the exit tube to become 
immersed.
The equipment was not particularly fragile when kept clamped 
to its vertical iron stand and accidental breakages were very few.

Analysis. After the cellulose ester, which had to be finely 
divided, had been thoroughly dried at 60° C. over phosphorus 
pentoxide in vacuo, a weighed sample, 0.3 to 0.4 gram, was put 
into flask A, together with 50 cc. of methanol, 10 cc. of the sodium 
methylate solution, and two or three glass beads. The flask was 
held in position on condenser B by means of rubber bands and 
the contents were kept in gentle ebullition for 3 hours by heat 
from a small flame. Cooling water was meanwhile circulated 
in condenser B. A cellulose acetate with which this preliminary 
transestérification was omitted analyzed 24.6 instead of 39.2 
per cent acetyl.
After 3 hours, flask C, containing an accurately measured 
volume, 25 cc., of the caustic soda solution, was very loosely at­
tached to D, so that the exit tube dipped below the surface of the 
liquid. The lower part of the flask was immersed in an ice bath 
and cold water was circulated in condenser E. Condenser B
320 INDUSTRIAL AND ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY Vol. 15, No. 5
was emptied. A large excess, 3 cc., of the p-toluenesulfonic 
acid solution was added through the dropping funnel attached 
to A and the mixture of methanol and methyl ester was slowly 
distilled into C. When the still residue had been reduced to about
15 cc., an additional SO  cc. of methanol was added dropwise from 
the funnel at such a rate that the volume in the still remained at 
20 to 25 cc. The stopcock on the dropping funnel was then 
left open and receiver C was firmly attached by rubber bands to
D, so that the exit tube remained above the surface of the liquid. 
After the ice bath was. replaced by a small flame under an as­
bestos sheet, the methyl esters in C were saponified by 1  hour of 
gentle ebullition. A low result was obtained with ethyl acetate 
when this time was reduced by one half.
Condenser E was then allowed to empty, cooling water was 
circulated in B, and the asbestos sheet over the flame was re­
moved. These changes caused the excess methanol to distill 
from C and thereby made it possible to obtain a sharp end 
point, instead of a difficult one, when the residual aqueous liquor 
was titrated with the standard acid in presence of phenolphtha- 
lein. The sulfuric acid and the caustic soda were frequently 
standardized against each other and not more than 0.2 cc. of the 
alkali was utilized in blank experiments with the reagents. 
The difference between these blanks and the milliequivalents of 
alkali remaining in an actual experiment was accepted as equiva­
lent to the amount of volatile acyl contained in the cellulose 
ester sample.

Results and Discussion
The determination in the form described above has been 
carried out more than 60 times with various cellulose esters. 
Very few of the duplicate estimations differed from the 
average acyl content by more than =¡=0.15 per cent; the 
great majority agreed to within 0.1 per cent and a consider­
able number to within 0.05 per cent. The dominant cause of 
deviation between duplicates was probably connected with 
the final titration, in which a buret reading to 0.1 cc. was 
used.
Pure ethyl acetate and pure, recrystallized sorbitol hexa- 
acetate gave data within 0.1 per cent of the calculated acetyl 
values, but doubt about the purity of cellulose ester samples 
made it more difficult to assess the accuracy of the method 
in these cases. The article by Gardner and Purves (3), 
however, contains examples in which the acetyl substitutions 
of a series of esters containing increasing amounts of the 
p-toluenesulfonyl radical were calculated from simultaneous 
equations involving both the acetyl and sulfur analyses. 
The acetyl substitutions found did not differ from their 
average value of 2.44 by more than =*=0.03 in 21 out of 22 
cases, and this error included those inherent in both the 
sulfur and the acetyl estimations.
Table I  summarizes the results obtained with a series of 
cellulose acetate-propionates and acetate-butyrates kindly 
supplied, together with their analyses, by C. R. Fordyce, of 
the Eastman Kodak Company. Only three of the twelve 
independent estimations of “apparent acetyl” differed from 
the Eastman figures by more than 0.2 per cent and this diver­MeanApparent

Company sample numbers were from 102,429 to 102,434 ingence corresponded to a titration difference of about ± 0.1 cc. 
in the experiments. The average values were about 0.1 per 
cent higher than the Eastman data, for reasons that are still 
obscure. These observations suggest that the present esti­
mation is at least as accurate as the Ost technique, for which 
a precision of ± 0.2 per cent is quoted (4), and may be appli­
cable to cellulose butyrates, with which the Ost method often 
gives low results (4). The latter method also requires at 
least 7 hours of intermittent attention instead of the 5 or 6 
hours demanded by the present one.
Although the procedure analyzed sorbitol hexa-acetate per­
fectly, it was not applicable to the acetates of reducing sugars 
because pure /3-glucose penta-acetate analyzed 56.2, 59.4, 
58.6, and 58.5 instead of the proper value of 55.2 per cent 
acetyl. The 6-chloro- or 6-iodo-6-desoxy-cellulose acetates 
also gave high acetyl, data because traces of halogen-contain- 
ing substances passed into the standard caustic soda solution. 
Corrections for this effect by estimating halogen in the 
titrated solution were not very successful, although proper 
allowance could be made in this way for samples containing 
5 per cent of chlorine added as sodium chloride. A few 
analyses of cellulose acetate-nitrates also gave high results.
When both the “apparent acetyl” and the actual per­
centage of acyl groups in a mixed ester are known, an easy 
simultaneous equation makes it possible to calculate the 
individual amounts of the acyl substituents, provided only 
two are present. All the mixed esters in Table I  except the 
first were accordingly deacylated by a modification of Zem- 
plen’s procedure (fl) and the loss in weight of each sample was 
taken as equivalent to its original acyl content. Although 
the final data for acetyl, propionyl, and butyryl were always 
within 1  per cent of those in Table I, the calculation ignored 
the fact that the percentage of acyl found in this way differs 
from other acyl values in being based upon the equivalent 
weight of the radical minus unity.  The agreement there­
fore owed much to the cancellation of errors and the method 
in its present state, although fairly rapid, is probably inferior 
in accuracy to those described by Malm and his collaborators 
(5 ,6 ).

CE RT A IN  difficulties are encountered in the determina­
tion of bromide in salt brines containing much calcium 
and magnesium by the method of van der Meulen (3).
This involves the oxidation of bromide to bromate by means 
of hypochlorite at 80° to 90° C. in a solution buffered with boric 
acid and borate. The excess of hypochlorite is destroyed by 
adding an excess of hydrogen peroxide and the hydrogen peroxide 
is removed by boiling in the presence of osmium tetroxide as 
catalyst. The bromate is then determined iodometrically. The 
use of formate for the removal of the excess hypochlorite is also 
suggested (4).
D ’Ans and Hofer (/) pointed out that the reaction is quanti­
tative only within a definite pH range, but gave no numerical 
values. They suggested the use" of so'dium dihydrogen phos­
phate as a buffer, but this precipitates calcium and therefore 
cannot be used.
Kolthoff and Yutzy (2) used essentially the same procedure, 
but unfortunately gave no data on the limits for the pH. They 
used an ammonium molybdate solution as catalyst to hasten the 
reaction between potassium iodide and bromate, a suggestion 
already made by van der Meulen (4).
The difficulty with all the methods lies in the uncertainty 
in maintaining the solution at the correct pH when the bro­
mide is oxidized to bromate. Since a solution containing no 
precipitate is preferable, phosphate buffers were not used in 
this work. The solutions were adjusted to the correct pH, 
using acetic acid-sodium acetate buffers. Experiments 
showed that the presence of acetate does not interfere. To 
find the limits of pH for the quantitative oxidation of bro­
mide to bromate, samples containing a known amount of bro­
mide and 5 grams of reagent sodium chloride were subjected 
to the procedure of Kolthoff and Yutzy except that an acetic 
acid-sodium acetate buffer w r as used. The results are shown 
in Table I. The pH was measured with a Beckman pH meter.
It is evident that the oxidation of bromide to bromate with 
hypochlorite is quantitative between pH 5.5 and 7.0.
The procedure was tested by analyzing synthetic brines, which 
were prepared as follows: 2.5 grams of anhydrous calcium chlo­
ride, purified by recrystallization from methanol and subsequent 
drying at 130° C., were dissolved in 25 ml. of water and 5 grams ofreagent grade sodium chloride were added, followed by a known 
amount of potassium bromide solution. After 10 ml. of the hypo­
chlorite solution were added, the pH was adjusted to between
6.0 and 6.5. Since the presence of hypochlorite interferes with 
the use of common acidimetric indicators, a small amount of 
zinc acetate was added to the solution. After some zinc hy­
droxide was precipitated glacial acetic acid was added dropwise 
until all zinc hydroxide was just dissolved. At this point the pH 
was between 6.3 and 6.8.
The solution was acidified with hydrochloric instead of sul­
furic acid because of the presence of calcium. The results ob­
tained are shown in Table II.

Dilute or concentrate a sample containing no more than 13 ing. 
of bromide to 25 to 50 ml. in a 400-ml. beaker. If the solution is 
distinctly acid or alkaline, neutralize with acetic acid or sodium 
hydroxide solution. If there is not an excess of chloride in the 
sample, add 5 grams of reagent, grade sodium chloride. After 
all solids have dissolved add 5 to 10 ml. of the sodium hypochlo­
rite solution, depending on the amount of bromide present. Ad­
just the pH to between G.O and 6.5, using a glass electrode, by 
adding glacial acetic acid and, if necessary, sodium hydroxide 
solution. As alternative add a solution of 0.1 gram of zinc ace­
tate in 5 ml. of water containing a few drops of acetic acid, and 
after obtaining a precipitate of zinc hydroxide add just enough 
glacial acetic acid dropwise to dissolve all zinc hydroxide. On 
swirling no zinc hydroxide should remain on the sides of the 
beaker.
Rinse down the sides of the beaker with water, heat over a 
small flame, and bring the solution to boiling in 5 to 10 minutes, 
then add 5 ml. of the sodium formate solution or 2.5 grams of 
solid c. p. sodium formate. This should cause an effervescence 
of carbon dioxide, indicating that a sufficient excess of the so­
dium hypochlorite was used. Rinse down the sides of the beaker 
and boil for a few seconds. Cool to room temperature, dilute to 
150 to 200 ml., and add 5 ml. of a 20 per cent potassium iodide 
solution or 1  gram of solid potassium iodide. If free iodine is 
liberated at this point the sample must be discarded. Add 8 ml. 
of concentrated hydrochloric acid diluted to 30 ml. and 1  or 2 
drops of 0.25 M ammonium molybdate solution. Titrate irnme-

of the blue color.
Run a blank in the same manner, using the same amounts of 
reagents. The blank usually requires between 0.2 and 0.8 ml. of 
0.01 N sodium thiosulfate solution.
One milliliter of 0.01 N thiosulfate solution corresponds to 
0.00013319 gram of bromide.
The thiosulfate is conveniently standardized against analytical 
reagent potassium iodate.
Sum m ary
An improved method of determining bromide in brines is 
described. The bromide is oxidized to bromate with hypo­
chlorite at a pH of 5.5 to 7.0 which is adjusted by using zinchydroxide as indicator or by using a glass electrode. After 
the removal of excess hypochlorite by formate the bromate is 
determined iodometrically. This method is rapid and is suit­
able for amounts of bromide up to about 13 mg. with an ac­
curacy of about 2.5 parts in 1000. 
Iodide and all oxidizing reagents that will liberate iodine 
from iodide in an aqueous solution interfere.

Determination o f Water in Aniline by a Cloud  
Point Method
W ILLIAM  SEAMAN, A. R. NORTON, a n d J. J. HUGONET 
Calco Chemical Division, American Cyanamid Company, Bound Brook, N. J.
A M ETHOD has been reported for determining water in 
aniline by means of the cloud point of a mixture 
of the aniline with rapeseed oil (2, 8). Because rapeseed oil 
is imported and its sale is subject to governmental priorities, 
it seemed desirable to attempt to substitute an oil more 
easily available to American chemists, so that the use of the 
method (which is a good one) in the wartime production of 
aniline would not be hindered. It was found that a mixture 
of cottonseed oil and heavy mineral oil could be used satis­
factorily instead of rapeseed oil, with some points of ad­
vantage for the mixed oil over the rapeseed oil. The method 
using mixed oil has a standard deviation from the true value 
for a single determination of ±0.006 per cent of water up to 
about 1.5 per cent of w ’ater, and ±0.009 per cent from 1.5 
to 4.2 per cent of water. The standard deviation using 
rapeseed oil was found to be ±0.015 per cent of water up 
to a water content of 2 per cent.
Reagents
C o tto n s e e d  O il. The commercial “cooking oil” first used 
had a specific gravity (25° C./25° C.) of 0.9172 and a refractive 
index (nJ D ° ° C.) of 1.47324, and the insoluble fatty acids obtained 
upon saponification had a freezing point of 31.9° C. The oil 
gave a positive response to the Ilalphen test for cottonseed oil 
(red coloration upon heating in carbon disulfide with amylalcohol 
and sulfur). Wesson oil, a brand of cottonseed oil, which was 
also used, had a specific gravity (25° C./250  C.) of 0.9171.
M in e r a l O il. The mineral oil first used was a heavy white
oil that had a specific gravity (25° C./25° C.) of 0.8756 and a 
refractive index (n?g ° C.) of 1.47916. Nujol, a brand of medicinal 
mineral oil, which was also used, had a specific gravity (25° C./ 
25° C.) of 0.8757.
M ix e d  O il. Five parts by volume of cottonseed oil and 
one part of mineral oil were used with the slight adjustment 
described below.
Apparatus and Procedure
All apparatus must be dried by heating and cooling in a desicca­
tor, by a stream of dried air, or, for the aniline pipet, by washing 
several times with the aniline sample to be analyzed.
With a 5-ml. Mohr pipet, transfer 3.5 ml. of the mixed oil to a 
test tube (2.5 X 15 cm., 1  by 6 inches) and then add (25-ml.Mohr pipet) 20 ml. of the aniline. Insert into the test tube a 
two-hole cork stopper containing in one hole a thermometer and 
in the other a stirrer w r ith a loop to encircle the thermometer. 
(Any efficient stirrer can be used.) The thermometer may be 
of any type, but it should be calibrated in tenths of a degree 
centigrade and the temperature should be capable of being 
estimated to at least 0.05° C. There should be about 5-mm. 
clearance between the bottom of the test tube and the bottom of 
the thermometer bulb. When 20° range thermometers are used, 
two are necessary, one covering the range 30 ° to 50 0  C. for water 
up to about 2.5 per cent, and the other 40° to 60° C. for water 
from 2.5 to about 4.5 per cent.
With constant stirring of its contents, the tube is dipped into 
a warm water bath until the opaque emulsion just changes to a 
slightly turbid liquid. It is immediately removed from the bath 
in order to avoid too high a rise in temperature, and its contents, 
which are now clear, are stirred with long even strokes (about 
50 to 80 per minute) until the cloud point is reached. This is 
recorded to the nearest 0.05° C. About 0.3° to 0.4° C. above 
the cloud point, a slight turbidity develops, which increases 
gradually upon cooling, giving an indication of the approach of 
the cloud point. Then suddenly, within a temperature drop of 
less than 0.05° C., the mixture becomes milky and practically 
opaque. This constitutes the cloud point.
The percentage of water may be calculated from the linear 
equation:
Per ccnt water by weight =
cloud point found (° C. corr.) —  cloud point of dry aniline
_________________________________________________ (°C. corr.)
mean variation of cloud point for 1  per cent variation in
water content
Substituting the proper constants, for cloud point values 
up to about 42.60° C. (1.15 per cent water) the formula 
becomes:
Per cent water by weight =
cloud point found (° C. corr.) —  36.80 
5.043
For values of the cloud point from 42.60° to 58.75° C. 
(4.2 per cent w'ater) the value of the denominator changes 
and the equation becomes:

Duplication of Mixed Oils
When a fresh batch of mixed oil is made up, it can be 
adjusted by adding cottonseed or mineral oil, so that dry 
aniline will have a cloud point of 36.80° C. within the normal 
variation. The formulas could then be used without change, 
but it is advisable to check them with a few samples of 
aniline of known water content. About 7 or 8 ml. of mineral 
oil added to 1 liter of 5 to 1  mixed oil raise the cloud point by 
about 1°, whereas about 40 ml. of cottonseed oil lower the 
point by the same amount. It is thus easier to adjust 
finally by adding cottonseed oil rather than mineral oil.

In this way it is possible to adjust the proportions of 
cottonseed and mineral oils of different origin so that the 
given formulas may be used, but this adjustment must be 
made by trial and error. Merely to mix cottonseed and min­
eral oils in the same proportions will not necessarily give an 
oil which will fit the formulas. For instance, before any 
adjustment, two samples of mixed oil (made from cotton­
seed and mineral oils from different sources, but mixed in 
the same proportions as exactly as possible) gave, with the 
same sample of aniline, cloud points of 39.70° and 36.90° C., 
respectively.
Fairly dry oils should be used, but small variations in 
their water content are of slight influence. If water is 
present, it will effect the initial cloud point of the mixed 
oil, but since the latter is finally adjusted to a definite value, 
the adjustment automatically corrects for the water present, 
This would obviously not be possible with a single oil such 
as rapeseed oil.
A mixed oil was prepared from Wesson oil and Nujol, in 
order to determine whether adjustments of a fresh batch 
of oil, made with different samples of cottonseed oil and 
mineral oil, to a 36.80° C. cloud point for dry aniline would 
maintain the correctness of the formulas. Ten known aniline 
solutions containing from 0.00 to 1.18 per cent by weight 
of water were examined. The values found by using the 
formulas agreed with the known values as closely as the 
known accuracy of the method would lead one to expect.Precision and Accuracy
The formulas given above are based upon a plot of a total 
of 51 values for cloud points obtained with aniline samples 
of known water content.
The precision of the values obtained is less for samples 
with more than 1.15 per cent of water than for those with 
less water. Using solutions of water in aniline ranging 
from 0.000 to 1.199 per cent of water, the cloud points 
deviated from those calculated from the formula by from 
+0.07° to —0.05° C. for 34 values. The standard deviation 
of a single value from the arithmetic mean was ±0.03° C. 
(equivalent to ±0.006 per cent of water). (The standard 
deviation is the square root of the arithmetic mean of the 
squares of the deviations of the individual values from their 
arithmetic mean. It represents the range above and below 
the arithmetic mean within which about 68 per cent of the 
determined single values will lie. By determining more than 
one value, the standard deviation of the mean will be that 
of a single value divided by the square root of the number 
of values used in obtaining the mean value.)
In the range 1.514 to 4.230 per cent of water, the cloud 
points deviated from those calculated from the formula 
by from +0.08° to —0.07° C. for 17 values. The standard 
deviation was ±0.046° C. (equivalent to ±0.009 per cent 
of water). It is obvious that the precision of the values 
should decrease with an increase in the difference between 
the cloud point and room temperature, as occurs with the 
higher values, because of more rapid cooling.
If the aniline used for determining the constants of the 
equations can be shown to be free of water in so far as this 
can be proved, considering the precision of the method, the 
precision will then be synonymous with the accuracy. Mere 
distillation in a well-dried system and collection of a middle 
cut of constant boiling point was unsatisfactory, yielding 
aniline which had 0.02 per cent of water. The aniline which was 
finally used was obtained by distilling 2.5 liters of aniline, col­
lecting 21 cuts, and determining cloud points on alternate cuts. 
It was assumed that constancy of the cloud point would indi­
cate a dry aniline. This assumption was based on the high 
sensitivity of the method to the presence of small amounts 
of water. (It might, of course, be sufficient to dry the 
aniline merely by an efficient desiccant.) After the first- 
cut of 350 ml. (cloud point 37.30° C.) the cloud points of all 
the other cuts (1965 ml.) varied between36.77° and 36.87° C. 
for ten values, with no trend toward lower cloud points in 
the later cuts. The mean value was 36.80° C. with a standard 
deviation of a single value from the mean of ±0.048° C. 
Since 36.80° C. is a mean of ten values, its standard deviation 
= * = 0  048° Cwould be —  , - — o r  ±0.015° C., which is less than the 
V 10
limit of reading the thermometer. Consequently, the value 
taken for dry aniline is of sufficient precision to indicate 
that the method is as accurate as it is precise.
Search for Most Suitable Oil
Before deciding upon a mixed cottonseed-mineral oil to 
replace rapeseed oil, other possibilities were considered. 
Mineral oil alone was not satisfactory. When as little as 
1  ml. was used with 25 ml. of stock aniline containing no 
added water, the mixture remained cloudy even in a boiling 
water bath. Castor oil alone was too viscous for satisfactory 
use; besides, mixtures with the stock aniline containing 
1 ml. of the oil to 25 ml. of aniline or equal proportions of 
oil and aniline did not become turbid even in an ice bath. 
A mixture of 5 ml. of castor oil and 1  ml. of mineral oil with 
25 ml. of aniline gave a fairly reproducible cloud point at
3 2 4 INDUSTRIAL AND ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY Vol. 15, No. 5
about 53.5° C., but the point was not so sharp as with rape- 
seed oil and, in addition, oily droplets persisted even above 
the temperature at which the main turbidity had vanished. 
Additions of 1  and 2 per cent of water caused increases of 
about 4.5° and 7.5°, respectively, in the cloud point, but 
the oily droplets still persisted.

Jansen and Schut (S) studied the cloud points of aniline 
containing water in solution, by means of rapeseed, soy, 
arachis, and maize oils added in the proportion of 1  part of 
oil to 4 parts of aniline (by weight). They reported cloud 
points for dry aniline with these oils as 37.6°, 8.7°, 26.2°, 
and 11° C., respectively.
Before fixing the proportions of mixed oil as 5 parts by 
volume of cottonseed oil to 1 part of mineral oil, the cloud 
points were determined with cottonseed oil alone added to 
aniline in various proportions. The oil was unsuitable 
in any proportion which was tried, because the cloud points 
obtained with it were not only too low for manipulative 
convenience, but could not be obtained with sufficient 
precision. Figure 1  illustrates the variations in cloud points 
of a stock sample of aniline with changes in the proportion 
of cottonseed’ oil used. Even the highest cloud point ob­
tained is below the usual room temperature. The use of this 
oil would, therefore, necessitate a cooling bath that would 
have to be regulated to within a few degrees of the expected 
cloud point. Even then the precision was actually con­
siderably poorer than with the mixed oil.
On the basis of the behavior of the aforementioned oils 
and with a consideration of their availability, mixtures of 
mineral oil and cottonseed oil were tried.
Figure 2 gives the variation in the cloud point with a changing 
ratio of mixed oil to aniline for a mixture of 5 parts (by volume) 
of cottonseed oil to 1.2 parts of mineral oil (curves A and B) 
and for another mixture of 5 parts of cottonseed oil to 1.0 part 
of mineral oil (curves C and D). . A and C are for stock aniline, 
and B and D are for stock aniline with 0.2 per cent of added 
water. With both oil mixtures the cloud point reaches a maxi­
mum with 3.5 ml. of oil for 20 ml. of aniline, but with the 5 to
1.0 mixture the slope of the curve changes more slowly near the43 VARIATION OF CLOUD POINT WITH

5 to 1  mixture,-when used in the ratio of 3.5 ml. of the mixture 
to 20 ml. of aniline, would suffer less change in cloud point 
because of small variations in the ratio of mixed oil to aniline, 
and so would be preferable to the 5 to 1.2 mixture.
Comparison of Rapeseed Oil and Mixed Oil 
Procedures
The use of the mixed oil instead of rapeseed oil has several 
advantages.
With rapeseed oil the transition from a clear to a cloudy 
solution is abrupt, so that the analyst has no warning of 
the approach of the cloud point. W ith the mixed oil a 
region of about 0.3° to 0.5° C. occurs upon cooling, in which 
the mixture gradually assumes a turbid appearance, which 
is followed by the abrupt formation of a distinct opacity. 
The latter is taken as the cloud point and is reproducible. 
Dolique ( 1) has reported that a similar phenomenon takes 
place upon adding various substances to the phenol-water 
system when the added substances contain impurities. He 
considers this behavior to be characteristic of quaternary 
systems for low concentrations of the fourth component. 
In the analysis for water in aniline the water would serve as 
the fourth component present in low concentration.
Another advantage lies in the fact that with the mixed
oil there seems to be less tendency toward a loss of moisture 
during the heating preliminary to determining the cloud 
point. The loss of water with both oils is, of course, greater 
for high than for low concentrations of water. For water 
concentrations from 0 to about 1  per cent, reheating the 
aniline-oil mixture in the manner described for the test 
caused the cloud point to drop about 0.05° C. with rapeseed 
oil, and from 0° to 0.05° C. with the mixed oil. For aniline 
containing from 1  to about 3 per cent of water, with the use 
of rapeseed oil the cloud point suffered a change of 0.2° to
0.4°, whereas with the mixed oil it changed by from 0° to
0.15°. For a sample of aniline containing 4.2 per cent of 
water, with rapeseed oil the change was 0.8° to 1.0°, whereas 
with the mixed oil the change was only 0.20° to 0.25°. This 
would indicate that the use of the mixed oil might offer less 
liability of error because of change in composition during 
the preparation of the mixture for the test.
Still another advantage of the mixed oil over the rapeseed
oil is the possibility of adjusting any batch of oil to the 
value obtained with the previous batch, regardless of the 
differences in moisture content of the oil. With rapeseed 
oil, an entire new calibration might have to be made with 
every new batch of oil. For instance, the authors found 
when using a commercial rapeseed oil that the cloud points 
from 0 to 2 per cent of water were 35.90° to 47.75° C. cor­
rected, respectively, about 1.4° C. lower than the correspond­
ing values reported by Griswold (2). The slopes of the lines 
representing the two sets of data were, however, identical.
The mixed oil also appeared to have some advantage in 
precision. Nineteen cloud point values were obtained w T ith 
rapeseed oil on solutions of water in aniline ranging from 0 
to 2.2 per cent by weight. The values deviated from the 
best possible mean straight line by from +0.15° to —0.15° C. 
The standard deviation was =*=0.087° C., equivalent to =*=0.015 
per cent of water. The standard deviation calculated from 
Griswold’s data is =*=0.027 per cent by weight of water for 
values up to about 2 per cent of water.

Determination o f the Saponification Number  
o f Fats and Oils
Elimination of the Blank
W ILLIAM  RIEMAN III 
School of Chemistry, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, N. J.
A“DOUBLE-indicator method” has been developed for 
determining the saponification number of fats and oils. 
For almost all oils this method gives excellent checks with 
the standard method and requires less time, reagents, and 
apparatus.
Figure 1 represents the potentiometric titration of the 
solution obtained by saponifying 5 grams of oil or fat with 
50 ml. of alcoholic potassium hydroxide according to the 
standard procedure ( 1). The acid added up to the first 
point of inflection is used to neutralize the excess potassium 
hydroxide. The acid added between the two points of in­
flection is used for the reaction
RCOO- + K+ + I I +  + Cl" — > -  RCOOH + IC+ + Cl~
Some of the fatty acids formed in this part of the titration 
separate as a solid or liquid phase. The acid added between 
the two jumps is equivalent to the soap formed or to the 
potassium hydroxide that reacted with the oil during the 
saponification. Therefore, the saponification number of 
the oil can be calculated from the weight of oil taken, the 
volume of acid used between the two jumps, and the con­
centration of this acid. The volume of alcoholic potassium 
hydroxide and its concentration are not required for the 
calculation, and the blank titration is eliminated.

However, the slope of the graph at the second equivalence 
point is ordinarily not great enough to permit an accurate 
determination of this point either with the potentiometer 
or with a suitable indicator. This slope is given by- the 
equation (2, S)
rfpH
dv V:KLV
where v is the buret reading, N the normality of the hydro­
chloric acid, K the ionization constant of the fatty acid, Vthe total volume of the solution, and L the number of mil­
limoles of fatty acid in solution at the equivalence point. 
An accurate solution of this equation is not practical because 
the titration deals with a mixture of fatty acids rather than 
with a single acid and because the ionization constants of the 
acids in the mixture of alcohol and water are not known.
Nevertheless, the equation indicates that the slope can 
be increased (arithmetically) by decreasing the quantity of 
fatty acid dissolved in the alcohol-water mixture. This is 
readily accomplished by the addition of 10 ml. of benzene, 
which extracts most of the fatty acids from the aqueous 
layer. This removal of the fatty acid also raises the pH of 
the equivalence point. For example, in the titration of 
saponified corn oil without the addition of benzene, the 
second point of inflection occurred at a pH of 3.76 and had 
a slope of —2.1 pH units per ml.; in another titration per­
formed by the same procedure except for the addition of 10 
ml. of benzene, the pH at the second point of inflection was 
4.31 and the slope was —6.9.
Reagents
Alcoholic potassium hydroxide is prepared according to the 
standard procedure, the alcohol being previously distilled from 
a mixture of potassium hydroxide and aluminum (1). The 
solution is filtered to remove potassium carbonate. The storage 
bottle is fitted with a two-hole rubber stopper which carries an 
Ascarite tube and a siphon. Thus the solution is effectively 
protected against the absorption of carbon dioxide.
Bromophenol blue (0.010 M ) is prepared by mixing 1.3 grams 
of the indicator with 2.0 millimoles of sodium hydroxide and 
diluting with water to 200 ml.
Procedures
P o te n tio m e tr ic  M e th o d . Five grams of oil are saponified 
according to the standard method (/), except that the volume of 
alcoholic potassium hydroxide is measured only roughly and a 
U-shaped Ascarite tube is attached to the upper end of the reflux 
condenser. This tube contains Ascarite in only one side, and the 
other side (inverted) is attached to the reflux condenser. Thus 
there is no possibility that any Ascarite will contaminate the 
solution.
After saponification, the solution is cooled to room tempera­
ture, or slightly above room temperature if necessary to prevent 
the crystallization of the soap. A cork stopper fitted with glass 
and calomel electrodes is placed in the neck of the flask. The 
solution is titrated with standard 0.5 N hydrochloric acid, the 
pH readings being taken on a Beckman pH meter, laboratory 
model. In the vicinity of the first equivalence point, the acid 
is added in increments of 0.10 ml. After the first equivalence 
point, 10 ml. of benzene are added, and the titration is continued. 
Near the second equivalence point, increments of 0.10 ml. are 
again added, and the flask is swirled vigorously after each addition 
to hasten the extraction of the liberated fatty acids by the 
benzene.
The inflection points are located by calculating the second 
differentials of the pH with respect to the buret reading, A2 pH/ 
Av2, and interpolating to find the buret reading at which this 
differential is zero. The slopes are considered to be ten times 
the maximum increment in pH.
D o u b le - In d ic a to r  M e th o d . The oil is saponified as in the 
potentiometric method. After cooling, 17 drops (0.3 ml.) of 
1  per cent alcoholic phenolphthalein are added. Then 0.5 N 
hydrochloric acid is added until the color of the indicator dis­
32S
appears. The volume of acid used to reach this end point need 
not be measured. Then 3 drops (0.2 ml.) of 0.010 M bromo- 
phenol blue, and 10 ml. of benzene are added, the buret is refilled 
to the zero mark with standard 0.5 N hydrochloric acid, and the 
solution is titrated to a green color.
This end point is sharp. The solution is distinctly blue a 
drop or two before the end point, and distinctly yellow a drop or 
two beyond. Nevertheless a few cautions may be helpful. The 
solution ordinarily turns yellow several drops before the end point 
is reached. Then on agitation, the color changes to blue again 
as the fatty acids are extracted by the benzene. The end point 
is a green color that is not changed to blue by further swirling of 
the flask. The benzene also extracts the coloring matter (usually 
yellow) of the oils. Upon agitation of the flask before the end 
point is reached, the emulsion of the yellow benzene in the blue 
aqueous phase sometimes gives the appearance of the green end 
point. Fortunately, the two phases separate quickly when the 
agitation is stopped, and the color of the aqueous phase can be 
observed.326 INDUSTRIAL ÄND ENG

Results
The pH values and the slopes at the two equivalence 
points for the titrations of various oils are recorded in Table
I. Ten milliliters of benzene were added after the first 
equivalence point in all these titrations.
A comparison of the results obtained by the recommended 
methods with those of the standard method (1) is given in 
Table II.
Discussion
It is well known that the glass electrode fails to check the 
hydrogen electrode in solutions of high pH and also in solu­
tions containing a large concentration of alcohol. Therefore 
the values read on the scale of the Beckman pH meter in 
this work should not be interpreted as exponents of hydrogen- 
ion activity or concentration. The uncertainty of the 
liquid-j unction potential between the aqueous solution in 
the calomel electrode and the mixed solvent adds further 
doubt to the meaning of the pH values. Nevertheless, 
these values were perfectly reproducible and changed on 
addition of acid or base in the expected direction. They may 
be used to compare the acidity of two solutions that have 
approximately the same ratios of alcohol to water.
Varying quantities of phenolphthalein were added to some 
of the solutions that were titrated potentiometrically. It 
was found that the disappearance of the indicator color 
coincided best with the inflection point when 17 drops of
1 per cent phenolphthalein were added. Therefore this 
quantity was used in the double-indicator method.
Table I reveals that for all the oils studied, except acety- 
lated castor oil and palm oil, the second inflection point occurs 
near a pH of 4.3. Bromophenol blue was chosen as the 
indicator for this end point because it shows a sharp color 
change at a pH of 4.3 in the mixed solvent.Table II reveals that the recommended methods give 
excellent checks with the standard method for all the oils 
studied except acetylated castor oil and palm oil. The 
failure of the recommended methods with acetylated oils 
is to be expected because the benzene fails to extract acetic 
acid from the aqueous phase. This results in a low pH 
at the second equivalence point, a small slope of the graph 
at this point, and hence an unsatisfactory end point with 
the indicator.
The behavior of the sample of palm oil is more puzzling. 
The high saponification number obtained by the standard 
method indicates that the oil was not pure and that palm 
nut oil was a likely adulterant. The low pH and small 
slope at the second equivalence point indicate the presence 
of fatty acids of very low molecular weight.
The potentiometric method is time-consuming and is 
recommended only for highly colored oils. The double­
indicator method, however, gives accurate results and 
requires less time, reagents, and apparatus than the standard 
method.
The double-indicator should be more easily adaptable 
to microprocedures than the standard method. In any 
micromodification of the standard procedure, it would be 
necessary either to measure accurately a very small volume 
of alcoholic potassium hydroxide or to use a very dilute 
solution of this reagent. In the first alternative, difficulty 
would be encountered because of the volatility and large 
expansion coefficient of the alcohol. In the second alter­
native, the time of saponification would be prolonged. In 
the case of the double-indicator method, a small volume of 
fairly concentrated alcoholic potassium hydroxide could be 
used without the necessity for accurate measurement or 
control of this volume.NEERING CHEMISTRY Vol. 15, No. 5

When several saponification numbers are to be run, the 
following modification of the double-indicator method may 
be advantageous:
Pipet 50.00 ml. of alcoholic potassium hydroxide into each of 
the flasks containing the weighed samples of oils. After saponi­
fication, titrate two or three samples by the double-indicator 
method, but measure the volume of standard hydrochloric acid 
used to reach both the first and the second end points. The 
total volume of acid is the same as the blank titration of the 
standard method. Then the remaining samples need to be 
titrated only to the phenolphthalein end point.

son with other methods based on the same chemical reac­
tion, has the advantage of yielding a straight-line calibra­
tion curve over the concentration range specified.
Principle of M ethod
The method is based on photoelectric measurement of the 
color intensities of hydrogen peroxide solutions treated with 
titanium sulfate reagent. The yellow color produced in the 
reaction was first observed by Schonn ( 5) and according to 
Treadwell and Hall ( 6) is due to the forma­
tion of pertitanic acid. The reaction equa­
tion is usually written
Ti+ + + +  + HjO, + 2H2 0 = IIjTiO, + 4H+
although some chemists prefer to write the 
formula of pertitanic acid as Ti02.H2 0 2 , 
showing a true peroxide structure. It was 
Jackson ( 2) who pointed out the quantitative 
possibilities. Richardson (4) and Knecht (S) 
developed methods in which colors were com­
pared visually. More recently Allsop (1) 
reported on a photoelectric method which is 
discussed in greater detail below.
Reagents and Solutions
All reagents were of the purest grade obtain­
able.
The titanium sulfate test reagent was pre­
pared by digesting 1  gram of anhydrous titanium 
dioxide (Schering-Kahlbaum) with 100 ml. of 
sulfuric acid (specific gravity 1.84) for 15 to 16 
hours on a sand bath at a temperature of 150° C.The solution was cooled, diluted with 4 parts (by volume) of dis­
tilled water, and filtered through an asbestos mat prior to use. 
Preliminary experiments in which varying quantities of reagent, 
ranging from 2 to 50 ml., were diluted to 100 ml. with distilled 
water indicated no color or turbidity to be present.
A standard hydrogen peroxide solution was made by diluting 
20 ml. of 30 per cent hydrogen peroxide solution to 1  liter with 
distilled water and standardized by titration with permanganate.
Apparatus
The photoelectric colorimeter was a Klctt-Summer- 
son Model 900-3 in which was used a KS-40 filter 
(transmission limits 380 to 430 millimicrons). An 
unusual feature of this instrument is the scale on 
which readings are made. This scale is logarithmic 
and has been designed so that under certain specified 
conditions the scale readings are a measure of and 
are proportional to the optical density of the colored 
solution as determined by the photoelectric cell. 
Since the optical density is theoretically proportional 
to the concentration of the colored substance, the 
scale readings are likewise proportional to the con­
centration under the specified conditions.
O ptim u m  Q uantity of Test Reagent for 
M axim um  Color Development
To ascertain whether the intensity of color is a 
function of the quantity of titanium sulfate used, 
varying quantities of the test reagent were added to 
known quantities of hydrogen peroxide solution con­
tained in a series of 100-ml. Nessler tubes. All solu­
tions were then diluted to 100-ml. volume with distilled 
water and the intensity of color was measured by 
transferring to the solution cell of the colorimeter. 
In all, three such experiments were made in which concentrations 
of 18, 9, and 1.8 mg. of hydrogen peroxide per liter were used. 
Cell depth was 40 mm. Results are shown graphically in Figure 1.
It is evident that 1  volume of titanium sulfate reagent per 
10 volumes of peroxide solution is required for maximum color 
development. As far as could be ascertained, the color is 
developed instantly and remains stable for at least 6 hours. 
In view' of this finding, 10 ml. of reagent were used in all subse­
quent experiments.

Conformity to Beer’s Law
A  series of solutions, containing from 1.8 to 27 mg. of hydrogen 
peroxide per liter, was prepared by placing the appropriate quan­
tity of peroxide in 100-ml. Nessler tubes, adding 10 ml. of titanium 
sulfate reagent to each tube, and diluting to the mark with dis­
tilled water. After thorough mixing the solutions were trans­
ferred to the colorimeter cell. Color intensity was measured 
using three different cell depths: 40, 20, and 12.5 mm.
That Beer’s law is followed by the color system is evident 
from the fact that a straight line is obtained when the scale 
readings are plotted against the hydrogen peroxide concen­
tration (Figure 2). The deviation from the straight-line re­
lationship for the higher color intensities (scale readings 
above 300) observed in the cases of the 20- and 40-mm. cell 
depths is probably due to the fact that a relatively wide 
band-pass filter was used. The use of a smaller cell, 12.5 
mm., eliminates this deviation and increases the effective 
range of the method. In view of this, in order to obtain 
conformity to Beer’s law throughout any given range of con­
centrations, it is necessary that the cell depth be adjusted 
to the colorimetric system.

obvious that this can be done.

though similar in some respects to the one described herein, 
does not give a linear calibration curve over the entire concen­
tration range nor does it cover the same range of concentra-SCALE READING

cell and a blue filter giving maximum transmission at 470 
millimicrons, he measured the optical densities of solutions 
containing varying amounts of hydrogen peroxide treated with 
titanium sulfate. For purposes of comparison, his data 
are shown graphically in Figure 4, together with the results ob­
tained by,the author. The difference in the linear character 
of the two curves is obvious.
The accuracy with which hydrogen peroxide can be deter­
mined with this method is shown in Table I. W ith the 12.5- 
mm. cell it is possible to determine hydrogen peroxide in 
concentrations ranging from approximately 0.2 to 3.0 mg. 
per 100 ml. with an average deviation of ±0.03 mg. per 100 
ml.
Sum m ary and Conclusions
A rapid and accurate colorimetric method for the deter­
mination of hydrogen peroxide is described. Beer’s law is 
valid for measurements at 380 to 430 millimicrons. How­
ever, in order to obtain conformity to Beer’s law throughout 
any given range of concentration, it is necessary that the 
cell depth be adjusted to the colorimetric system. A 12.5- 
mm. cell increases the effective range of the method, permit­
ting determination of hydrogen peroxide concentrations 
ranging from approximately 0.2 to 3.0 mg. per 100 ml. of 
solution with an average deviation of 0.03. Relatively dark 
solutions can be diluted without invalidating Beer’s law. 
For maximum color development 1 volume of test reagent 
per 10 of solution is required.

Current Methods of Measuring Foam
SYDNEY RO SS, Departm ent of Chemistry, Stanford University, Calif.
WH EN  methods of foam measurement were previously 
considered, an initial classification was based on 
the obvious differences between “static” and “dynamic” 
methods. Static methods are those in which measurements 
are made after the foam has been produced, with no reference 
to the manner of its production. In dynamic methods 
measurements are made while the foam is being formed, 
usually by a current of gas passing through the liquid.

F ig u re  1. Ross and C la r k  S ta tic  
Foam A pparatus
Method A, applicable to carbonated liquids 
Method B, applicable to uncarbonated liquids
It has already been shown that results obtained by the 
various methods do not necessarily agree (6). It is not 
generally possible, when dealing with a property of matter 
so complex as the foaminess of a liquid, to make classifications 
that can be universally applied. In  the present case it is 
recognized that static and dynamic methods represent only 
an empirical distinction and that there exist more funda­
mental theoretical considerations upon which a final classi­
fication of methods must be based. Meanwhile the two terms 
are of value in providing a method of approach to the prob­
lem of foam measurement, especially with a view to unraveling 
the complex mass of results and conclusions contained in the 
literature on the subject.
It is proposed in the present paper to examine some of the 
recently published methods of both types, to obtain evidence 
of whatever correlations may exist, and to establish if possible 
a better understanding of the factors involved.
Static Methods Involving Drainage
Static methods usually consist of forming a foam, in any 
one of a number of possible ways, and observing the rate 
at which liquid drains or collects from it, beginning the 
observations some time after cessation of foam formation.It has been discovered experimentally that for many foams 
the rate of drainage of liquid obeys the equation
V = 7oe-*‘ 
or In V JV  =  kt
where V = volume of liquid in the foam after time t, Vo = 
volume of liquid in the foam when t =  0, t = time, and k is a 
constant characteristic of each liquid from which the foam 
is formed. This logarithmic equation has been found to hold 
for such diverse substances as beer (4), wine (1), saponin (2), 
Aerosol OT (15), and lauryl sulfonic acid (15). It would 
therefore appear to be a general law for the behavior of foams. 
Deviations are known to exist—e. g., foams of egg albumin 
(5)—but they can be explained on the basis of specific con­
siderations for the case in point.
Using this mathematical relation, it was possible to establish 
a unit of foaminess for all static foams (5, 16),  which can be 
applied regardless of the way in which the foam is produced 
and independently of many empirical restrictions of former 
methods.
Figure 1  illustrates the Ross and Clark static method for 
both carbonated (method A)_and uncarbonated liquids (method 
B). The foam is produced in the former case by pouring the 
liquid from a height and in the latter case by bubbling a gas 
through it. In both cases the same value for the foaminess was 
obtained, using the reciprocal of the constant of the exponential 
equation as a unit of foaminess. A modification of method B, 
capable of greater accuracy, is illustrated by Figure 2, This is 
the Stiepel foam meter and can be used to measure not only the 
rate of drainage of the liquid but also the volume of foam pro­
duced. In this way it can be applied as a dynamic method (with 
certain limitations because of the narrowness of the tube) as 
well as a static method.
Figure 3 represents the apparatus used by 
Arbuzov and Grebenshchikov (2) to measure 
the foam stability of saponin solutions. Ten 
cubic centimeters of the liquid are put in the 
buret, D, and go out at an even rate, one drop 
at a time, onto the porous filter. The con­
tainer, A, is connected to a water pump, a 
mercury manometer, and an outlet valve, 1C . 
When the solution passes through the filtering 
medium it takes up air from the pores and a 
foam is produced in the cylinder. As soon 
its all the solution has thus been converted 
into foam, valve E is opened and the drainage 
of the foam is allowed to proceed under 
atmospheric pressure. The rate at which 
the liquid drains from the foam is measured, 
using the narrow graduated tube at the 
bottom of the cylinder. The apparatus is 
kept in a thermostat during the whole 
process.
It is considered undesirable by these 
authors to observe the breakdown of a 
foam while the foam remains under the 
influence of the conditions which caused 
its formation. This is really an expression 
of preference for a static rather than 
for a dynamic method. More significant 
is the attention that they draw to the 
fact that, by their method, the sur­
face-active substance is equally distributed 
through the whole mass of foam, because 
liquid is turned into foam one drop at a 
time until no more liquid remains. In 
other methods, where the entire remain­
ing body of the liquid is present whileF ig u re  2.

Foam M e­
te r

the foam is being formed, the liquid is continually depleted 
of surface-active agent, so that succeeding portions of the 
foam are progressively different, yielding a nonuniform foam. 
Hence, the method of foam formation may influence the 
experimental value of foam stability. However, it would 
seem that this is important chiefly in very dilute solutions of 
surface-active agents.3 3 0  INDUSTRIAL AND ENG
Figu r e  3. Static  Foam Met er  Used 
by Arbuzov  and G reben sh ch ikov  
(2, Page 33)
Arbuzov and Grebenshchikov (2) found that the ex­
ponential relation holds for the later half of the drainage of 
the foam, and they considered the reciprocal of the ex­
ponential constant to be a satisfactory unit of foam stability.
It would therefore appear that, with or without the con­
ditions mentioned by Arbuzov and Grebenshchikov (£), 
the exponential relation is commonly obtained for drainage 
of a foam; moreover, results are reproducible within very 
wide experimental limits. There is little difficulty in cor­
relating the results because of the same underlying relation 
for the drainage. In each case the total liquid collected is 
actually measured, and although collapse of the films takes 
place simultaneously, it is not measured as such but finds 
its place in the effect that a smaller volume of foam must 
exercise on the rate of drainage.
It is immediately recognized that where the foam possesses 
absolute stability, drainage of liquid is a purely hydrodynamic 
matter and has no relation at all to the foam stability. This 
has been pointed out by Ross and Miles (14), who suggest 
measuring the effect of an arbitrary standardized destructive 
mechanism acting upon a volume of foam during production 
under standard conditions and protected from adventitious 
destructive forces. This procedure is necessary only for 
foams of such stability that the films will drain without 
simultaneous or immediately subsequent collapse.
Dynam ic Foam  Methods
The lack of mathematical relations to express the opposing 
rates of growth and decay of a dynamic foam makes the 
task of correlating these methods considerably more complex 
than for static foam methods. In dynamic methods theemphasis is taken off the question of drainage from the foam 
and focused only upon the position of the topmost films. 
The effects that are actually measured are either the rate of 
rise of the foam in the measuring cylinder or the maximum 
constant volume of foam obtained, in both cases when a gas 
is passed continuously through a foam-producing liquid. 
It is, of course, impossible to prevent draining of the liquid 
from the foam and the consequent thinning and ultimate 
collapse of the liquid films, but only the rate of collapse is 
actually measured in dynamic methods. The rate of drain­
age, although it is not measured directly, nevertheless 
operates in the effect that a more rapid rate of drainage has 
in altering the rate of collapse of films.
This is in direct contrast to the static methods and the 
two together lead to the conclusion that the foaminess of a 
liquid, as it  is usually measured, is a derived or subsidiary 
property, compounded of at least two quantities, drainage 
of films and collapse of films, themselves dependent on more 
fundamental properties such as viscosity, density, surface 
tension, vapor pressure, cohesion, and charge.
In most foams, whether measured by static or dynamic 
methods, it is difficult completely to segregate the drainage 
from the collapse of the films. Methods should be char­
acterized by the relative emphasis given to these two quan­
tities— that is, by the specific property measured rather than 
by the manner of measurement. This is more satisfactory 
than merely designating them as static or dynamic.
Bikerm an Method
Bikerman (S) “aims at establishing foaminess as a definite 
physical property of a liquid, which must therefore be in­
dependent of the apparatus used and of the amount of ma­
terial employed in measuring it” . The apparatus he employed 
is a dynamic foam meter, of the kind recommended by Foulk 
and Miller ( 6) and by Lederer ( 9), as shown in Figure 4. 
Gas is forced at a measured rate through a porous membrane 
and an overlying layer of solution, as in most dynamic 
methods. The foam builds up until a constant maximum 
volume is reached.
The unit by which the foaminess is measured is designated 
as 2 and described as “the average lifetime of a bubble in 
the foam”. The derivation of 2 throws some light on its 
character.
When dynamic equilibrium has been reached, the amount of 
foam maintains its constant maximum volume. At any time 
during this equilibrium the mass rate at which gas is being 
passed into the liquid is equal to the mass rate at which it is 
rising in the foam, and also to the mass rate at which it is es­
caping therefrom. In a tube of constant cross section linear 
rates can be used instead of mass rates. If the linear velocity 
of the gas in the foam is u when a volume of gas, V, is forced 
through the membrane in t seconds, then
u = V/lQ
where Q is the cross section of the measuring tube. If now, at 
equilibrium, the average maximum height of the foam layer is
h, the expression h/u represents the time during which any 
arbitrary volume of gas is present in the foam. (The average 
maximum foam height is defined as the difference between the 
average maximum height attained by the liquid plus foam and 
the height of the liquid at rest.) It is this period of time that 
is 2 and the equation 2 = h/u gives a precise definition—namely, 
the average lifetime of the gas in the foam. This might better 
be designated as Le, because it is only in the rare case where there 
is no coalescence of bubbles within the foam that L , becomes 
equal to the average lifetime of a bubble in the foam. It involves 
assumption and interpretation to take the next step, which is 
to call L , the average lifetime of a bubble in the foam.
L , is easily found experimentally. The quantities measured 
are the average maximum foam volume, v, and the volume of gas,
V, passed through the membrane in time i. Then L„ = h/u, 
where h —  v/Q  and u = V/LQ.  Substitution leads to the ex­
pression L„ = vt/V.INEERING CHEMISTRY Vol. 15, No. 5
ANALYTICAL EDITION 3 3 1
The attainment of a con­
stant volume of foam indi­
cates equilibrium between 
building up of the foam by 
the in-going gas and the de­
struction of the top of the 
foam by the collapse of the 
topmost film or films. This 
is partly or often largely a 
matter of evaporation or con­
tamination. With liquids of 
great foam-forming capacity 
the former process so far out­
weighs the latter that equilib­
rium, denoted by a constant 
maximum foam volume, is 
not practicable.
It can readily be seen that 
the actual average life of a 
bubble even in the foam can­
not be defined by L0 unless 
there is no coalescence of 
bubbles before they disappear 
at the top of the foam. In 
actual practice, however, in 
many cases a single bubble 
present at the top of the foam 
may have started out as a 
large number of individual 
bubbles that have united 
somewhere on their upward 
journey to the top. Here 
L , would not represent a true 
average lifetime of a bubble 
in the foam.
Smaller bubbles are more 
stable than larger bubbles.
Hence 2 has a definite value for a given liquid only for a definite 
average size of bubble and a definite average amount of 
coalescence.
Another limitation on the meaning of S  is introduced by its 
method of measurement. If, for illustration, a pure nonfoaming 
liquid is considered and air is passed through at a measured 
rate, there will be an increase in the volume of the sample due 
to the added volume of air present in it at any given time. This 
leads to a positive value of h and u and so provides a numerical 
value for the foaminess of a nonfoaming liquid. The error thus 
introduced is significant for poorly foaming or viscous liquids.
A paper by Hoffmann and Peter (7A ) was not available until 
recently. Hoffmann and Peter used exactly the same unit 
as that originally proposed by Bikerman (8), though without 
any reference to his previous work. They used a capillary 
to produce a homogeneous foam of known bubble size. With 
hydrocarbon oils they observed only slight coalescence of 
bubbles in the body of the foam. For such foams it is per­
missible to interpret L„ as the average lifetime of a bubble, 
although the same reservations must be placed on that inter­
pretation in the general case as have already been mentioned 
for the Bikerman unit. The linear rate of increase of the 
foam volume observed at th£ beginning of the foam produc­
tion, although used by Mischke (10) and by Ostwald and 
Mischke (11) as a measurement of foaminess, is here more 
properly as a measurement of the rate of air input.
Effect of Size of Bubble
For a uniform film the chance of breaking is proportional 
to the exposed area, since breakage at one point causes collapse 
of the whole film; hence, the breakage of a bubble would 
depend upon the area exposed to the atmosphere or to other 
bubbles. Likewise, small bubbles are partly surrounded and 
protected by the mass of liquid in the Gibbs angle between 
them.
In general, therefore, the smaller a bubble the longer its 
life, which may be expected to be at least in inverse pro­
portion to the square of the diameter of the bubble.M a y  1 5 ,  1943

Conditions for Defining Rate of Collapse of Film s
If the rate of collapse of film, or the foam stability, for 
one and the same liquid is to have a definite and significant 
numerical value, the following factors must be taken into 
account:
1. The size of the bubble, which should be stated.
2. The age of the solution.
3. The rate at which bubbles are formed.
4. The time taken for the determination, because if the
time is protracted the rate of film collapse becomes abnormally 
slowed on account of the accumulation of stabilizing material 
on the remaining films.
5. In some cases carbon dioxide or reactive gases should be 
excluded from the atmosphere which is in contact with the 
foam. Carbon dioxide has a pronounced effect on stability 
of foam prepared from soap solutions and this perhaps may be 
true of some other surface-active agents.
It has been previously shown (17) that in addition to Nos.
2 and 3 there are two further factors which in practice can 
be important in affecting the stability of exposed film in an 
insufficiently enclosed apparatus. These are:
6. Temperature of the gas above the foam.
7. Partial vapor pressure above the foam for appreciably 
volatile solvents or solutes, often determined by the distance 
from the top of the foam to the top of the containing vessel.
Ostwald and Mischke M ethod
Ostwald, ¡Siehr, and Mischke (10-12)  have developed a 
dynamic foam meter in which gas bubbles of known size 
are passed into the liquid. For a constant flow of gas: the 
initial rate of rise of the foam in the measuring cylinder is 
taken as a measure of the foaming capacity of the liquid. 
In experiments with gelatin solutions between 10 and 0.1 
per cent concentration Mischke found that the initial rate 
of rise is the same for all the samples and is constant for the 
first 3 minutes of foaming. This strongly suggests the 
possibility that it was characteristic of nothing more than 
the rate at which air was being passed into the liquid, in
332 INDUSTRIAL AND ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY Vol. 15, No. 5
F ig u re  5. Dynam ic Foam M e te r  Used b t  P a n k h u rs t (13, Page 497)
accordance with the idea of Lederer (8, 9)  that the volume 
of foam produced from a strongly foaming solution is at 
first equal to the volume of air passed in. Experiments in 
this laboratory with dilute solutions of Aerosols have also 
proved the validity of this suggestion. It presents a formid­
able objection to their method, which is seen to be inap­
plicable to strongly foaming solutions.
The rate of formation of bubbles depends solely on the 
rate at which gas is bubbled through the liquid, itself deter­
mined by the difference in pressure, diameter of inlet tubes 
or pore diameters, viscosity of the gas and liquid, etc. Sub­
tracted from this arbitrarily determined rate is the rate of 
collapse of films, the resulting rate being the experimentally 
determined quantity. The rate of film collapse cannot be 
a constant quantity, as not only must it depend on the 
amount of foam present, which is increasing steadily with 
the time, but also on propinquity (an isolated submerged 
bubble cannot break, even if infinitely unstable), and drain­
age, which is a nonlinear function of time (15). (Film col­
lapse may indeed appear to be a linear function of time at 
the outset. Many complex functions can be approximated 
by a straight line when near the 
origin.) C o n se q u e n tly , if both 
kinetic factors are in simultaneous 
operation the experimentally deter­
mined rate of foam rise would not be 
constant, except possibly for a short 
time near the origin. It could be 
constant for a longer range only 
when film collapse is so delayed 
that it does not take place to any 
appreciable extent while the foam is 
being formed.then closcd and the pressure inside A is re­
duced to 10 cm. of mercury below that of the 
atmosphere and maintained by a constant- 
pressure device, D. When a steady pres­
sure difference is obtained, air is admitted to 
the liquid in A through the porous septum, 
F, by opening T3 . The rate of intake of air 
is 1200 cc. per minute (±15 cc.). The time 
required for the advancing foam front to rise 
to a height of 50 cm. is measured with a stop 
watch. This value, 0m seconds, is taken as an 
inverse measure of the foaming power of the 
liquid.
This method is similar in principle to that 
of Ostwald and Mischke and the objections 
to that method are also applicable to this 
one. It can be calculated from the informa­
tion given about the apparatus that the air 
itself passing into tube A would require 99 
seconds to rise 50 cm. in the tube. (Because 
of this fact one would not expect to find any 
values of less than 99 seconds, as it is 
hard to image any mechanism whereby the 
foam can rise at a faster rate than the rate at 
which the air is being passed into the liquid. 
Nevertheless, out of the 37 reported meas­
urements of 0 5 0  21 have values less than 99 seconds.) Con­
sequently, values of 0» in the neighborhood of 99 seconds 
could not be taken as characteristic of the foaminess of the 
liquid under test.
Schiitz M ethod
The gas is introduced by means of a single capillary, ending 
underneath the surface of the liquid (17). The amount of 
gas bubbled through the liquid is the same in every case, 
and corresponds to a reduction of pressure of the gas from 
18.80 to 15.40 cm. of mercury. The apparatus is shown 
schematically in Figure 6.
E is a device for obtaining the same initial pressure of the 
gas and J is a sintered-glass filter to retain fine dust particles. 
The tube, G, has at its end a “thermometer capillary ground 
to the shape shown in the inset of Figure 6. The period between 
the stoppage of the gas entry and the time when half the foam- 
covered surface of vessel F is free from bubbles, was called the 
“foam time”, T/, and used as a measure of foaminess. It is 
perhaps an unfortunate choice to use dissimilar quantities to 
define the extremities of the time period. To determine when 
exactly half the foam surface is gone, a wire circle of calculated
Pankhurst Method
Pankhurst (13) adopted a dynamic 
foam meter, a modification of that 
made by Foulk and Miller (< ?). A 
diagrammatic scheme of the apparatus 
is given in Figure 5.
The liquid under test is admitted to 
the large Pyrex tube, A, through the 
side tube, B. Tap Ti is then closed 
and the level of the liquid in A is ad­
justed to an arbitrarily chosen zero

means of tap Tt. Taps T, and Tt are

diameter is placed on the edge of the vessel, at a fixed distance 
from the eye of the observer (Figure 7). In most cases the 
bubbles break first in the center, leaving the remainder grouped 
around the wall, so that observation of the half area, as shown in 
Figure 7, offers no difficulty.
Although the measurement is made after the foam has 
formed, yet it is the time taken for collapse of films that is 
actually measured, and hence this method must be grouped 
along with those that emphasize a function of collapse rate, 
as do most methods that employ a dynamic foam meter.
In this method unusual care is taken to make allowance 
for the influence of the variables that have previously been 
noted to affect the stability of films. The solutions were 
always of equal age, the temperature was maintained con­
stant by a water bath at 21.4° C. (=¡=0.2°), and the distance 
from the surface of the liquid to the upper edge of the vessel 
(a in Figure 7) was kept at a low value (2.5 cm.), it having 
been shown that with higher values of a the results were not 
reproducible.

As with many of the methods previously discussed, this 
one too was inapplicable to strongly foaming solutions. For 
solutions of saponin greater than 0.001 per cent the values of 
Tj exceeded 50 minutes and, because of the difficulties of 
keeping conditions constant for so long a period of time, 
reproducible results could not be obtained. This particular 
method, however, would appear to be abnormal in this 
respect, as very much higher concentrations of saponin have 
previously been measured by other methods without undue 
difficulty (£, IS ).
Two improvements on the Schütz method are suggested. 
One of them is to restrict the amount of foam to a single 
ayer of bubbles on the surface, in order to dispose of the 
effect of drainage as much as possible; and to take this aszero time. The second improvement is the result of the 
observation that bubbles break first in the center of the 
liquid surface only when there is a wall around the periphery. 
This variable, due to a wall effect, can be eliminated by 
having the liquid surface flush with the top of the container, 
when it is observed that the bubbles will break first at the 
edges and cluster around the center. The author has found 
this to be a general phenomenon, true for both aqueous 
and nonaqueous systems.
Results obtained by the Schütz method confirm the results 
of Arbuzov and Grebenshchikov (2) for the foaminess of 
saponin solutions as a function of concentration. The 
Russian investigators, using a concentration range of 0.2 to
2.0 per cent, found that the foaminess, measured by a drainage 
method, could be related to the concentration up to 1 per cent 
by an expression similar to the classical adsorption isotherm,
F = aCh
where F is the foaminess, C is the concentration, and a and b 
are constants. At concentrations greater than 1  per cent the 
foaminess becomes practically constant. Schütz established 
the same mathematical relation for saponin solutions in the 
concentration range 10-3 to 10_6 per cent.
Single Bubble Methods
The relative simplicity of technique required for the pro­
duction and observation of single isolated bubbles floating 
on a liquid surface, as well as the fact that a single bubble 
is more amenable to a theoretical mathematical treatment 
than is a bulk foam, makes it likely that single bubble methods 
are due to receive a greater prominence than heretofore. 
Such a method has already been put to good use, as, for 
instance, by Hardy (7) and by Talmud and Suchowolskaja 
(18), to gain information about the nature of interfaces. 
There is no doubt that reproducible results can be obtained, 
which have been of value in research.
It is known, and can readily be demonstrated, that several 
bubbles together are more stable than each separately, 
possibly on account of the entrained liquid in the rounded 
corners and edges between them, discussed by Gibbs. Never­
theless, experimental results obtained by G. G. Lindquist 
and the author in this laboratory indicate a correlation be­
tween the results of single bubble observations and some 
foam-measuring methods for certain nonaqueous systems. 
A difference in the order of magnitude of the numerical 
result is to be expected but the same sequence of stabilities 
for a series of different samples can be obtained. A more 
extensive report of those experiments cannot be given at 
the present time.

Sum m ary
1. The chief methods, static and dynamic, currently 
employed to measure foaminess of liquids have been examined 
to ascertain the factors involved, since each measures a 
somewhat different complex of properties, such as drainage, 
apart from mere collapse or coalescence of bubbles.
2. For a film of a given stability the average life of a 
bubble is greater the smaller the bubble, increasing at least 
in inverse proportion to the square of the diameter of the 
bubble.
3. Methods have been suggested for examining the 
stability of foams with a minimum of complications through 
other factors.

Baume— Dry Substance Tables for  
Starch Suspensions
J. E. CLELAND, E. E. FA U SER1 , AND W . R. FET ZER, Union Starch and Refining Com pany, G ranite City, III.
No tables for Baume-dry substance starch 
have been published in this counlry, al­
though it is a large producer of starch. 
Such tables are presented for cornstarch, 
together w ith a new m ethod for moisture 
on starch suspensions. The experimental 
evidence indicates that such tables can be 
constructed m athem atically if the absolute 
density of the specific starch is known.
FOR many years the wet-milling industry in this country 
has employed the hydrometer for measuring the density 
of starch suspensions or slurries in their manufacturing opera­
tions. Various companies have adopted dry substance tables 
for these Baumd values, but no common table exists for use 
within or without the industry where starch is employed.
The use of a hydrometer for the measurement of solids in a 
suspension or slurry may seem strange to chemists who regard 
it solely from the standpoint of determination of density in 
true solutions. Its success in starch suspensions is based on 
the relatively slow settling of the starch and on the fact that 
the concentration of the starch suspensions at the hydrometer 
bulb is substantially constant. An analyst familiar with 
these properties acquires the technique readily and results on 
a common sample agree within 0.1 136. or 0.2 per cent dry 
substance.
Tables have been published for the Baum6-dry substance 
relationship for potato starch suspensions (4, 5, 6).  Other 
papers have been published on the densities of the various 
starches (S).
The purpose of this paper is to present such tables for corn­
starch, known in the trade as pearl starch, for the hydrometer 
in use in this country— 145 Modulus, standardized at 60° F.
Experimental
This work is based on methods previously published on the 
determination of the Baum6-dextrose equivalent-dry sub­
stance for corn sirup and corn sugar ( 1, 2) which should be

C o r n s ta r c h . The starch used for these tables was taken from 
the final washing filter in the factory. The cake from this filter 
is either dried to form the pearl starch of commerce or suspended 
in softened water for subsequent hydrolysis to corn sirup or corn 
sugar. A quantity of this suspension was washed by decantation 
or dewatered on a Büchner funnel, washed, and finally suspended 
in distilled water to approximate the various densities required. 
The starch had a crude protein content of 0.3 per cent on a dry 
basis.

eter cylinders and five 4-ounce (0.12-liter) screw-top bottles. 
The former were used for the determination of Baum6 by hy­
drometer and the latter for determination of density by pycnom- 
eter.
The starch in the cylinders was kept in suspension by means of 
a long rod which had a perforated disk at one end, and by care­
fully introducing and manipulating this agitator, no air was 
carried into the suspension. The hydrometer to be used was 
kept in a cylinder of distilled water adjacent to the cylinders 
containing the starch suspension, and when the temperature of 
the starch suspension was the same as that of the bath, the hy­
drometer was removed, quickly wiped free from the film of water, 
and placed in the starch suspension. When the spindle was at 
rest a small drop of methylene blue solution (in water) was added 
at the stem to accentuate the meniscus and the reading made at 
the upper edge of the blue line around the stem. Previous work 
had indicated that the differences between the reading of this 
point and the plane surface of the liquid (correct reading) was
0.08° Bd. Thus 0.08° Be. was added to the observed reading 
and this value appears in all tabulated data for Baumd
D e n s it y  b y  P y c n o m e te r . Settling difficulties presented a 
problem in the determinations of density by pycnometer and 
as a result three methods were used to overcome this trouble. 
None is completely free from criticism, although the latter two 
are regarded as more desirable. The pycnometers used have 
been described previously ( 2).
a. The 4-ounce samples mentioned above were kept in the 
bath while the Baum6 was determined by hydrometer. Then the 
temperature was raised or lowered a few degrees, depending on 
relationship of bath to room temperature, to compensate for heat 
changes during the transfer of the sample to the pycnometer. 
The bottle was agitated every 5 minutes, then returned to the 
bath, reagitated, etc. After five such agitations, the sample was 
transferred rapidly to the pycnometer, stoppered, and placed in 
the bath which was now set at the desired temperature. The 
pycnometers were kept in the bath for 30 minutes, then removed 
and weighed.
Using this method, difficulty was encountered at the higher 
concentrations in that starch collected at the ground surfaces. 
The precision was about 0.05° B6. and as a result this method was 
discarded for the heavier Baum6s and method b used instead.
The moisture on the starch was determined on one of the re­
maining 4-ounce samples, as described below.
b. The pycnometers were filled about three-fourths full at 
room temperature, heated to about 130° F., and boiled very 
gently under high vacuum to remove occluded gas. The starch 
was then allowed to settle and the remaining space was filled with 
cool, recently boiled distilled water. The pycnometer was 
placed in the water bath and weighed at the end of an hour. 
From this weight it was possible to calculate the specific gravity 
on the basis of complete suspension.
This method eliminated the difficulty of the collection of starch 
between seals and also enabled any loss through the capillary ofthe stoppers to be taken as pure water—i. e., no solids. The 
moisture test was made on a separate bottle as before.
c. The pycnometer was used with an added feature consisting 
of a test tuoe with standard-taper joint as shown in Figure 1. 
The starch suspension was run into the pycnometer until it was 
nearly full and then allowed to settle. When the top part of the 
liquid was essentially clear, the stopper was inserted ana the appa­
ratus placed in the bath. After an hour the pycnometer was re­
moved from the bath and weighed. Then the stopper and outer 
cap were removed and the test tube was applied. The suspension 
was shaken until uniform and a moisture determination made on 
this material.
This method eliminated the difficulties of starch at the seals; 
the liquid that was lost through the capillary was essentially pure 
water; and settling was not a dominant factor, since the moisture 
determination was made on the suspension actually present in the 
pycnometer. Tests were made to estimate the error introduced 
by loss of the film of water left on the stopper and cap which were 
removed when the test tube was attached for resuspending the 
starch. This was found to be 20 to 30 mg. on a 95- to 100-gram 
sample weight. This involves an error of 0.02 to 0.03 per cent 
and can be neglected for all ordinary purposes or be compensated 
for in work of highest precision.
D e t e r m in a t io n  o f  M o is t u r e . The method used is 
basically the same as that employed for the determination of 
moisture in corn sirup and corn sugar (./) which should be 
consulted for details.

Procedure.  Twenty-five to 35 grams of diatomaceous silica 
were run into duplicate flasks, the test tube was introduced, and 
weight constancy was obtained under oven conditions identical 
with those of the test. Weighings were made with an empty 
flask as a tare. The starch samples, either in the 4-ounce bottles 
or the pycnometer equipped with test tube, were shaken until 
homogeneous suspensions were obtained. Sample portions, 
sufficiently large to yield 5 to 8 grams of dry substance, were 
transferred quickly to the flasks by means of a pipet from which 
the tip had been cut. The sample was then worked into the 
diatomaceous silica by means of the test tube, which yielded a 
damp powdery mass.
The flasks were placed in a vacuum oven at 100° C., and thé 
pressure was reduced first by an efficient water pump until most 
of the water was removed and then by means of a Megavae pump. 
After approximately 4 hours of drying the flasks were removed

from the oven and cooled and the mass in the flasks was reworked 
into a fine powder. The flasks were returned to the oven, and a 
pressure of less than 1  mm. maintained until weight constancy 
was obtained. An overnight period has been found adequate. 
Because of the very hygroscopic property of dry starch, an 
efficient train ( 1) must be used to introduce air into the oven and 
the flask stoppers must be inserted immediately upon opening the 
oven.
This method gave reproducible results within very narrow 
tolerance. Microscopic examination of the dried starch 
revealed no visible change in the granules through rupture or 
gelatinization. Tests indicated that oven temperatures could 
be carried as high as 110° C. with no appreciable effect on the 
results.
The method of reporting data was the same as that previ­
ously used (2). The net pycnometer weight was corrected 
first to vacuum. In the case of the 60°/60° F. data, the 
density (vacuum) was obtained and the corresponding Baumé 
value assigned. This procedure was changed for 140°/60° F. 
and 100°/60° F. data. After the net pycnometer weights 
had been corrected to vacuum, an additional weight correction 
(glass expansion and hydrometer) was added before calculat­
ing the density in order to make these values agree with the 
corresponding hydrometer readings. The reason for this has 
been previously discussed (2). By this correction observed 
Baumé readings and Baumé values obtained by pycnometer 
always agreed within 0.05° Bé. and with an average deviation 
of 0.03° Bé.
The Baumé-dry substance data were plotted in two ways: 
Baumé vs. dry substance and Baumé vs. factors. In both 
cases the best curve was a straight line, as it should be if the 
slurry were a true suspension. The previously used method of 
factors was employed for purposes of tabulation.
The factors were:
Factor for 60760°F.(F60760°F.) = 1.7770JL Jé .
Factorfor 100760°F. (n00°/60°F.) = — M i—  = 1.7700
Factor for 140760° F. (FI40°/G0° F.) = + f 'Q1° = L753In Table I, the Baum6s in all cases are the observed values 
and the specific gravities (air) are those corresponding to the 
Baum6s.
In the above data the specific gravities at 60760° F. in air 
can be converted to vacuum by the usual calculations. The 
I00°/G0° F. and the 140760° F. data require not only the 
calculation for air to vacuum but also those for glass expansion 
and for hydrometer. This has been discussed previously (2) 
and an abridged table (Table II) is given here for those who 
may desire to express the data on some other basis.
Since most Baum6 tests in factory processes are not made 
at a fixed temperature, a table of temperature corrections is 
necessary (Table III).
The determination of each point in the table furnished 
enough data for calculation of the density of the actual starch 
solids. lienee a series of independent starch density values 
were obtained over the range of suspension gravities. These 
were observed to check very closely in the 60°/60° F. series 
and to average 1.636. Employing this value for the Baum6- 
dry substance relationship, a calculated table was found to 
check the experimental table within the limits of the experi­
mental methods used. It would appear, therefore, that tables 
for water suspensions of the whole gravity range could be pre­
pared for any starch from an accurate density value of starch 
solids determined at a single point. Each temperature, of 
course, would require a separate determination.
A table has been prepared for general factory use based on 
100 ° F (Table IV ). In  this table the Baumds are the observed 
readings, the specific gravities are those in air assigned to the 
Baumd values and the weights per gallon are based on these 
specific gravities.
Briefly, the corrections (Table V) mean that when the 
100°/60° F. table is used: for each 5° F. below 100° F., 
subtract 0.1° B < 5. from the reading; for each 4° F. above 
100° F., add 0.1° Bd. to the reading.

Dual Alternating Current Titrometer
C. J. PENT H ER AND F. B. ItO LFSO N  
Shell Development Com pany, Emeryville, Calif.
An instrum ent is described which com­
prises two complete titration stands and an 
alternating current-operated electrometer 
which allows the use of any electrode sys­
tem in  aqueous or nonaqueous solutions. 
Meter scales and potentiometer circuits are 
provided which give the instrum ent a range 
of —1.65 to +1.65 volts, readable to 0.5 
m illivolt, and w ith a calomel-glass elec­
trode system, a full pH  range readable to
0.02 pH  u n it. The stability is excellent and 
the grid current of the order of 10~1 2  am ­
pere.The calibration of the linear scale is within the 2 per cent error 
of the meter used. Individual calibration of the scale would 
materially increase the accuracy of the instrument.
Two Type 38 tubes are used, as the electrometer tubes. The 
rectifier is a type 6ZY5G, and a VR105 serves as a voltage regu­
lator. Total power consumption is approximately 10 watts. 
The vacuum tubes may be expected to have long life with this 
instrument because they are all operated well below their normal 
ratings. The replacement of the rectifier tube (6ZY5G) should 
require no circuit adjustments. Replacement of the voltage 
regulator (VR105) may require an adjustment of the potentiom­
eter circuit.
Controls
There are six panel controls: three switches and three variable 
resistors. The switches, requiring more frequent manipulation 
than the resistors, are placed at the bottom of the sloping front 
panel where they are convenient to reach. The 12-point switch,
THE increased use of sturdy glass electrodes and nonaquc- 
ous, high-resistance titration media in potentiometric 
titrations has emphasized the need for a versatile potentiom­
eter, or millivoltmeter (5), that will satisfactorily measure 
the potential between electrode terminals of a cell having a 
resistance up to 5000 megohms. The final step in the de­
velopment of an ideal laboratory titrometer—namely, the 
elimination of batteries with their attendant replacement 
problem and constant drift—is the subject of the present 
paper.
The dual alternating current titrometer, like the battery- 
operated instrument previously described, is continuously 
indicating and employs a step potentiometer in combination 
with the vacuum tube electrometer. The use of a continuous 
indicating meter not only requires less manipulation by the 
operator, but also enables him easily and definitely to ascer­
tain when the potential reaches equilibrium. The step 
potentiometer makes it possible to meet the requirement of 
wide range along with high sensitivity in a single indicating 
meter.
Figure 1 is a photograph of the instrument showing the 
housing which contains the electrometer circuit and supports 
the titration stands.
Accessory Equipm ent
The convenient titration stand previously described (3) has 
been incorporated to provide a complete titration unit which 
can be used for routine as well as special determinations.
Electrical Circuit
The electrometer circuit, shown in Figure 2, is of the single- 
stage, balanced-input type (2, 7). Careful circuit balance and 
large values of negative feedback have resulted in a highly stable 
circuit which has negligible zero-drift when operated under 
moderate conditions of line voltage variation.
The input grid current is of the order of 10~1 2  ampere. A 
minimum value of grid current is obtained by varying the plate 
voltage of the electrometer tubes so that the grid voltage-grid 
current curve is shifted along the voltage axis until zero grid 
current is obtained for an input voltage of plus 100 to 150 milli­
volts. When this condition is fulfilled the maximum grid current 
for both positive and negative input voltages is approximately 
equal ana occurs at full-scale deflection. A typical E0 -I„  curve 
for an average tube is shown in Figure 3; the grid current does 
not exceed 3.7 X 10" 1 8  ampere in any part of the range from 
—250 to +250 millivolts. Fig u r e  1. Du a l Alt e r n a t in g  Cu r r e n t  Tit r o m e t e r
S.i, controls the potentiometer circuits for both the millivolt and 
pH ranges. Switch < S 2  reverses the meter and also sets up the 
circuit for the pH calibration. Switch < S i shorts the electrode 
leads for zero adjustment, and connects them to a source of 250 
millivolts for full-scale adjustment, and to either the right- or 
left-side electrodes for potential or pH measurements. The 
variable resistor controls are for zero and full-scale adjustment 
and for compensation of variations in asymmetry potential of 
individual glass electrodes.
In addition to the three panel controls, there arc three controls 
mounted on the chassis inside the cabinet. One of these is a 
filament series resistor, F IL ., for tube balance, another aids in 
obtaining minimum grid current by adjusting the plate voltage,338
P.V., and a third, STD,  adjusts the main voltage divider to 
standard voltage.
Power Supply
All the direct current voltages are obtained from a voltage 
divider which is maintained at constant potential by the regulator 
tube. Plus or minus 10 volts’ change in line voltage (115 volts) 
results in a change in direct current voltage of = * = 0.1 per cent.
No power switches are provided; the rheostats on the motors 
have “off” positions against the counterclockwise stop, and it is 
intended that the electrometer circuit be operating continuously 
where it is in steady or intermittent use. The permanent tem-Vol. 15, No. 5 INDUSTRIAL AND ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY

perature equilibrium tlius established results in more stable 
operation, and the very low power consumption makes continuous 
operation entirely practical.
Constructional Details
In order that the instrument may function on a high input 
resistance, all connections to the “high” tube must be exceedingly 
well insulated. Switch Si should be Isolantite-insulated, the 
spring contact for the glass electrode connection should be sup­
ported on Isolantite or polystyrene, and the interconnecting leads 
should be of rigid bus-bar suspended in air between end terminals.
The envelope of the 38 electrometer tube is coated w'ith ceresin 
wax to prevent surface leakage. The envelopes are first carefully 
cleaned and then immersed in the molten wax (approximately 
140° C.) until all bubbling stops; the grid cap must be freed of 
wax before the tube is placed in service.
The instrument must be completely enclosed in a metal box, 
with the high input terminal located well w-ithin the box. A 
shielded-leacl type of glass electrode is necessary (/). Sheet iron 
can be used for all the box except the meter panel, which must be 
of nonmagnetic material because of the shunting effect of steel on 
the meter.
Lubricating the wires and sliding contacts of all the variable 
controls with a good grease is necessary to prevent fluctuations 
caused by poor contact.
Circuit Adjustm ents
After the tubes are installed the instrument is plugged into 
the power outlet and allowed to reach temperature equi­
librium. As the tubes warm up, the meter needle will swing 
across the dial once or twice and then approach a zero reading.
Ze r o Ad ju s t m e n t . Switch Si is placed on ZERO,  the panel 
knob, ZERO A D J.,  is set in the center of its travel, and the 
chassis-mounted filament rheostat, F IL ., is adjusted until the 
meter reads zero deflection. It may be neccssary to interchange 
the tubes (Type 38) to complete this adjustment. The needle 
may be adjusted to an exact zero reading by means of the ZERO  
A D J.  knob. Further zero adjustments will be required at 
longer intervals until the instrument has reached a temperature 
equilibrium.
St a n d a r d  Ad ju s t m e n t . One thousand millivolts from an 
accurate external potentiometer are applied to the input leads 
and switch S3 is set at 1.0 volt. The meter should indicate zero 
deflection and may be adjusted to that value by means of the 
chassis-mounted control, STD.
Fu l i-Sc a l e  Ad ju s t m e n t . Switch S i is placed on F.S. and the 
F.S. A D J.  rheostat varied until the meter indicates full scale.
Min im u m  Gr id Cu r r e n t  Ad ju s t m e n t . (1) The glass elec­
trode terminals are removed from their sockets.
2. Switch Si is placed on R or L, and switch St on REV.,  and 
the elect rometer circuit is then completely shielded.
3. Potentiometer P.V. is adjusted so that the meter needle 
floats near mid-scale (100 to 150 mv.). This is done by means of 
a screw driver inserted through holes provided in the bottom 
plate of the cabinet. Since there is a slight interlocking of con­
trols, it is advisable to check the full-scale adjustment. F.S., after 
setting P.V.If e. m. f. is to be measured, no other adjustments are required, 
but if a glass electrode system is to be used for pH readings, it will 
be necessary to make an adjustment for the asymmetry potential 
of the particular glass electrode used. To make this adjustment, 
switch Si is placed in the pH position, and if the usual pH 7 
buffer is used, sw'itch S3 in placed on 4 pH. Switch Si is next 
placed on L if the left-side electrodes are used, or on R if the right- 
side electrodes are used, and the A .P. A D J.  knob is varied until 
the meter indicates 3 pH (a total reading of 7 pH—i. e., 4 pH on 
the potentiometer switch and 3 pH on the meter). Only one 
asymmetry potential adjustment is provided, since potential 
equilibrium is ordinarily reached so rapidly in aqueous solutions 
that there is no advantage in making pH determination alter­
nately in two separate systems.
When potential measurements are made, the potentiometer 
switch is advanced from the zero position until the meter needle 
deflects on scale. The measured potential is then the sum of the 
potentiometer setting plus the meter reading.
If the meter indication is below zero when the potentiometer is 
on zero, the reversing switch, Sj, must be placed in its alternative 
position. When this switch is in the D (direct) position, the glass 
electrode is negative—that is, negative in the usual sense as 
applied to batteries and indicating electrical meters.
Operating Characteristics
Because of the electrical characteristics of the circuit, the 
meter may safely be used to measure any potential without 
previous knowledge of the magnitude or sign of the potential 
being measured, and without danger of polarization of the 
electrode system.L  E  D  IT  I  O N  3 3 9

Figu re  4. Z ero Stability  Run
Figure 4 is a record of a 2-hour stability run made without 
line voltage regulation. The maximum deviation over this 
period is less than =*=1.5 millivolts and the momentary devia­
tions are about ±0.5 millivolt. In locations having severe 
voltage fluctuations a transformer-type regulator will provide 
a perfectly stable zero.
Uses
In addition to all the usual applications involving electro- 
metric titrations using high-resistance glass, silver, platinum, 
antimony, and tungsten electrodes with their corresponding 
reference electrodes, and for spot determinations of pH, the 
instrument has been particularly useful in mercaptan deter­
minations (4, S, 9).
The dual feature permits two titrations to progress simul­
taneously, which approximately doubles the work capacity 
for lengthy titrations in nonaqueous media, such as deter­
mination of neutralization number of lubricating oils (1). 
Alternatively two diverse electrode systems may be left 
permanently set up, so that, for example, both acidity and 
sulfur titrations may be made without delay on the single unit.

Colored Chromatograms with Higher Fatty Acids

TH E  higher fatty acids, being colorless compounds of 
similar chemical and physical properties, present diffi­
culties in their chromatographic separation, and such separa­
tion by several workers ( 5, 6, 7)  has been successful only to a 
limited degree.
Cassidy (1, 2, 3 ) has made a careful study of the adsorption 
isotherms for various fatty acids in relation to their resolvability 
upon columns of various adsorbents. Among the obstacles en­
countered in using chromatographic columns has been inability to 
establish the location of the zones which define the separation of 
the various fatty acids in the mixture. This difficulty has been 
overcome in some colorless compounds {10,11,18),  but none of these 
methods has been shown to be applicable in the case of fatty 
acids. Martin and Synge (8) applied the principle of producing a 
color change on an adsorbent to the chromatographic separation 
of the acetyl derivatives of the higher monoamino acids but they 
employed two liquid phases. Trappe {12) observed that silica- 
gel columns became transparent or translucent when wetted by 
certain solvents, and under these conditions it was possible to 
observe zones formed in the study of lipid mixtures.this procedure, in that it is readily soluble in the acidified 
water.

Preparation of Im pregnated M agnesium  Oxide
About 0.5 gram of phenol red was dissolved in 10 to 15 ml. of 
95 per cent alcohol. A few grams of magnesium oxide were 
added and stirred into a paste, which was mixed thoroughly
This paper describes a method for separating mixtures of 
certain higher fatty acids into their components with the aid 
of adsorption columns, using an adsorbent impregnated with 
a dye to serve as an indicator. To be suitable for following 
the adsorption of fatty acids on an adsorbent, an indicator 
must change color on the column when in contact with the 
fatty acid, it must be insoluble in both the solvent for the 
fatty acid and the eluting agent and, in addition, it must re­
vert to its original color after elution of the fatty acid. Pre­
liminary experiments showed that phenolsulfonphthalein 
(phenol red) as manufactured by the Eastman Kodak Com­
pany satisfies the above conditions. Columns prepared with 
heavy magnesium oxide impregnated with this indicator 
proved satisfactory in bringing about and observing a separa­
tion. (Good results were obtained only when the heavy 
magnesium oxide manufactured by the J. T. Baker Chemical 
Company and the phenol red manufactured by the Eastman 
Kodak Company were used.)
The fatty acids were recovered from the adsorbent by dis­
solving the magnesium oxide in particular sections of the 
column {4) in concentrated hydrochloric acid and water, and 
subsequently extracting the fatty acid with diethyl ether. 
Magnesium oxide was found to be particularly adaptable toi t

while the alcohol was being evaporated on an electric hot plate. 
The resulting pink powder was dried in an oven at 100° C. The 
dried powder was mixed with 100 grams of magnesium oxide and 
the mixture was screened through a 200-mesh sieve. The ad­
sorbent was then ready for use.
Procedure
The adsorption column was retained in a vertical cylindrical 
glass tube 11 to 12 mm. in diameter and 60 to 70 cm. in length, 
constricted at the lower end. A plug of absorbent cotton held in 
position by a perforated porcelain disk was tamped over the con­
striction in the glass tube.
A mixture of dye-impregnated magnesium oxide and petroleum 
ether in the form of a slurry was poured rapidly into the tube and 
the adsorbent was allowed to settle as the solvent percolated out 
of the tube, forming a column 20 to 22 cm. in length, but the liquid 
was never allowed to fall below the surface of the adsorbent. 
The best columns were obtained when the adsorbent was allowed 
to settle under a layer of solvent for several hours.
The fatty-acid mixtures were dissolved in about 50 ml. of 
petroleum ether and added to the column. The column was then 
cautiously filled with petroleum ether and connected by means of 
a siphon to a reservoir-flask of petroleum ether at a higher level. 
When the fatty-acid mixture came in contact with the adsorbent, 
a bright yellow band was formed which separated into zones upon 
development. The chromatogram was developed by allowing 
petroleum ether to percolate through the adsorbent continuously 
until clearly defined zones were obtained. The volume of 
petroleum ether used and the rate of flow varied, depending on 
the packing of the column.
After formation of clearly defined zones, the column was per­
mitted to run dry, forced from the tube, and then cut into sections 
as defined by the change in the color of the adsorbent. The cuts 
were made in order best to demonstrate the separation of the con­
stituents of the mixture. The fatty acids were recovered from 
the adsorbent by dissolving the latter in hydrochloric acid and 
then extracting with diethyl ether. The ethereal extracts were 
washed free of indicator and acid by water in a separatory funnel 
and subsequently dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and 
evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen. The residues 
were dried in a vacuum over phosphorus pentoxide to constant 
weight. Samples were removed for iodine number (5) and 
melting point determinations.

By means of the above procedure it was possible to demon­
strate a separation of (I) an unsaturated fatty acid from a 
saturated fatty acid of the same number of carbon atoms and 
(II) two saturated fatty acids differing in length of chain by 4 
carbon atoms.
In (I) a mixture of 100 mg. of stearic acid (CisH3 602 ), 
melting point 69.8° C., and 100 mg. of oleic acid (CisHmOj), 
iodine number 86.4, was used. The development of the 
chromatogram required 17 days. The appearance of the 
column and the definition of the zones are sketched in Figure 
1. The analytical data shown in Table I indicate an almost 
complete separation of the fatty acids in the mixture. Prac­
tically all of the stearic acid was retained in section 1  and the 
oleic acid had moved down the column.
The fractions recovered from sections 2 and 3 were pale 
yellow oils.
In (II) a mixture of 50 mg. of stearic acid (CisH3 6 0 2 ), m. p. 
69.8° C., and 50 mg. of myristic acid (ChBW^), m. p. 
54.6° C., was used. The development of the chromatogramrequired 14 days. The appearance of the column and the 
definition of the zones are sketched in Figure 1  and the 
analytical data are tabulated in Table II.
The fractions recovered on evaporation of the ether solu­
tions from the different sections to dryness, without recrystal­
lization, gave successively lower melting points from the top 
to the bottom of the column, indicating that a separation had 
been accomplished. These fractions probably contained 
traces of solvent or other accumulated impurities. By re­
crystallization from acetone it was possible to show that the 
acids recovered from section 1 and section 2 consisted mainly 
of stearic acid and myristic acid, respectively.
The generality of the application of this method to chro­
matographic separation of a mixture of fatty acids is indicated 
by the fact that definite zones have been obtained with other 
mixtures of fatty acids. In the case of palmitic and stearic 
acids, where the length of chain differs by only two carbon 
atoms, zones were developed, but it was difficult to establish 
definite proof of a separation using melting points as criteria 
because of the proximity of their melting points.

Sum m ary
A method has been described for separating mixtures of 
higher fatty acids by Tswett adsorption analysis, whereby 
separation into zones was observed on a column of heavy 
magnesium oxide impregnated with a suitable indicator. 
The fatty acids were recovered by dissolving the magnesium 
oxide in particular sections of the column in acid and extract­
ing with ether. By this procedure it was possible to demon­
strate a separation of an unsaturated fatty acid from a satu­
rated fatty acid of the same number of carbon atoms and of 
two saturated fatty acids differing in chain length by four 
carbon atoms.

Determination o f Fluorine in Organic  
Compounds with Cerous Nitrate
M . L. N IC H O LS ANI) J. S. OLSEN , D epartm ent of Chem istry, Cornell University, Ithaca, N. Y .
THE increasing importance of organic fluorine com­
pounds makes a simple, reliable method for the deter­
mination of fluorine in such compounds extremely desirable. 
Reliable methods for the determination of chlorine, bromine, 
and iodine in organic compounds have been available for 
many years. However, fluorine differs considerably in its 
chemical behavior and the usual halogen methods cannot 
be applied for its determination.
Halogens are generally determined in organic compounds 
by decomposition of the compound and then determination 
of the halide ion. The fluorine-to-carbon bond is much more 
stable than the other halogen-to-carbon bonds and this 
makes the problem of decomposing organic fluorine com­
pounds, to transform the fluorine to the fluoride ion, some­
what more difficult than in the case of the other halogen 
compounds.
In the case of compounds of the less stable type, where the 
fluorine is on a side chain or in certain aliphatic compounds, 
the decomposition rnay be accomplished by refluxing with 
metallic sodium or potassium in absolute alcohol or any other 
suitable inert solvent. Drogin and Rosanoff (Iff) applied this 
method for chlorine, bromine, and iodine, but Whearty (59) 
was not very successful in applying it to the analysis of several 
fluorine compounds. Vaughn and Nieuwland (57) used sodium 
in liquid ammonia or if the compound was insoluble in liquid 
ammonia, added ether. In a few cases where the carbon bonded 
to the fluorine is also bonded to oxygen, as with carbonyl fluo­
rides, fluorinated alcohols, or sulfonyl fluorides, decomposition 
may be accomplished by refluxing with aqueous or alcoholic 
potassium hydroxide. This was used by Morgan and Tunstall 
(42) with boron beta-diketone fluorides.
Piccard and Buffat (46) heated fluorcbenzene in a glass tube 
with potassium at 400° C. and obtained a rapid removal of the 
fluorine. Similarly Simons and Block (58) and Elving and 
Ligett (17) decomposed fluorocarbons and other fluorine com­
pounds by heating with sodium or potassium in an evacuated 
tube.
Kimball and Tufts (8-2) recommended thermal decomposition. 
Although chlorine, bromine, and iodine can be transformed to 
free ions by this method at moderately high temperatures, Meyer 
and Hnb (40) found that fluorine bonded to aromatic rings 
required 2 hours’ heating at 1000° C. in a nickel or platinum bomb 
tube for complete transformation into the fluoride ion.
Bockemuller (9) considered the general methods of decom­
position and used a combustion method. The fluorine com­
pound was burned in an atmosphere of oxygen at 900° C. in a 
platinum tube with the exit end of the tube packed with granular 
calcium oxide. Hubbard and Henne (30) used a similar method 
in a silica tube packed with granular quartz. Bigelow (5) 
modified the method slightly. The method appears to be very 
useful for gaseous compounds and very volatile liquids, but has 
not been used for stable solid substances.
Another method which appears to have general application 
is sodium peroxide fusion using a Parr bomb (86, 45).  Hahn 
and Reid (24), Bigelow (8), and Locke, Brode, and Henne (37) 
have reported analyses of fluorine by this method.
After the fluorine is in the ionic state, it may be determined 
either gravimetrically or volumetrically. The gravimetric 
methods most generally used are those of Berzelius (7, 9),  
Starck (55) and Hawley (25), Pisani (47), and Allen and Furman 
(2). Adolph (1) obtained reliable results with both the calcium 
fluoride method and lead chlorofluoride method, which was also 
used by Elving and Ligett (17), but the thorium fluoride method 
of Pisani gave low results. The triphenyl tin fluoride method 
of Allen and Furman is somewhat inconvenient, since the precipi­
tation is made in boiling 70 to 80 per cent alcohol.
The most important volumetric methods are those of Willard 
and Winter (60), Kurtenacker and Jurenka (34), Batchelder and 
Meloche (5), Gyot (23), Greef (22), Offerman (44), Hempel and 
Scheffler (26), Wagner and Ross (58), and Hoffman and Lundell
m -Willard and Winter titrated with thorium nitrate using a 
zirconium-alizarin mixture as indicator, and Longer (35) made 
this titration polarographically. Gyot and Greef titrated 
the fluorine with ferric chloride, using thiocyanate as indicator, 
and Treadwell and Kohl (56) determined this equivalence point 
potentiomctrically. Hoffman and Lundell precipitated the 
fluorine as lead chlorofluoride, filtered, dissolved in nitric acid, 
and determined the chloride by the Volhard method.
Kurtenacker and Jurenka and Batchelder and Meloche 
proposed the titration of the fluoride with cerous nitrate. The 
titration must be started with the solution about neutral and 
at the equivalence point there is a rapid change in the pH which 
can be determined by using methyl red as indicator or potentio- 
metrically (8). The titration has also been made with yttrium 
nitrate (20).
The remaining methods depend upon the evolution of fluorine 
as silicon tetrafluoride, absorbing it in water or alkali, and 
titrating. Comprehensive surveys of the methods of determining 
fluorine are given by Meyer (89) and Hemler and Pfening- 
berger (27).
Experimental
The titration of fluorine with cerous nitrate after the 
decomposition of the organic compound with sodium peroxide 
has the possibility of an accurate, rapid, and convenient 
method for the determination of fluorine but has been found 
to give erratic results. Therefore, this work was undertaken 
to make a systematic study of the effect of the initial pH, 
initial volume, concentration of fluorine, temperature, 
presence of neutral salts, and use of alcohol as solvent to 
determine the optimum conditions and limitations of this 
method.
Pure sodium fluoride was prepared by evaporating reagent 
hydrofluoric acid in a platinum dish to about three-fourths its 
volume, neutralizing with sodium carbonate solution, making 
just acid with hydrofluoric acid, and cooling. The sodium fluo­
ride was filtered off on a sintered-glass funnel, washed with 50 
per cent alcohol, dried at 110° C., and ignited to a dull red. 
This pure sodium fluoride was analyzed for fluorine by the lead 
chlorofluoride method (25) and three analyses gave results of 
45.26 = * =  0.24 per cent fluorine. A spectroscopic examination 
showed only a trace of silicon and less than 0.01 per cent of 
potassium.
Pure cerous nitrate was prepared by the method of Smith, 
Sullivan, and Frank (54). One thousand grams of 40 per cent 
crude eerie oxide were added slowly to 2 liters of hot concentrated 
nitric acid in a large evaporating dish 0 1 1  a steam bath. After 
all the oxide was added the gelatinous residue was filtered off, 
400 granis of ammonium nitrate were added to the clear, deep 
red filtrate, and the solution was evaporated slowly. When the 
supernatant liquid became light yellow, the crystals of eerie 
ammonium nitrate were filtered off on a sintered-glass funnel. 
This salt was about 95 per cent pure and when ignited to the 
oxide was dark brown, which is characteristic of eerie oxide 
contaminated with other rare earth oxides (18). Five recrystal­
lizations from hot concentrated nitric acid gave pure eerie am­
monium nitrate. The absorption spectrum of a 0.3 M solution 
of this salt with a glass-prism Hilger spectrograph showed 
that praseodymium and neodymium were present in less than 
2 parts per thousand (4,10, 49, 50).
The purified eerie ammonium nitrate was dissolved in water, 
reduced with perhydrol, and precipitated with oxalic acid. The 
cerous oxalate was washed several times by decantation with a 
hot, saturated ammonium oxalate solution, filtered, washed free 
from ammonium oxalate, and dissolved in nitric acid. It was 
necessary to digest the solution on a steam bath for some time 
to destroy the oxalate completely. The cerium was again 
precipitated with sodium carbonate and the cerous carbonate 
filtered and washed thoroughly with hot water. The cerous 
carbonate was added to enough water to form a slurry and 
nitric acid added in an amount not quite sufficient to dissolve
M a y  1 5 ,  1943 ANALYTICAL EDITION 343
it. This is essential, as it is impossible to 
remove the nitric acid if an excess is added.
The excess cerous carbonate was filtered off 
and the solution evaporated until it became 
sirupy. After crystallization, the cerous nitrate 
was removed by heating the dish for a few 
minutes, pulverized, and stored in glass-stoppered 
bottles.
The potassium dichromate was prepared 
according to Kolthoff and Sandell (33) and all 
other reagents were of reagent grade and used 
without further purification.
Approximately 0.01 N solutions of sodium 
fluoride, cerous nitrate, ferrous ammonium sul­
fate, and potassium dichromate were prepared.
The sodium fluoride and potassium dichromate 
solutions were standardized by direct weighing, 
the ferrous ammonium sulfate by titration 
against dichromate using diphenylamine sulfonic 
acid, and the cerous nitrate by titration (61) 
against the ferrous ammonium sulfate, using 
o-phenanthrolineferrous ion.
Batchelder and Meloche (5) tried to carry 
out' the titration of sodium fluoride with 
cerous nitrate potentiometrically but obtained 
unsatisfactory results due to adsorption by 
the hydrous cerous fluoride. However, a few 
preliminary experiments with the glass elec­
trode showed that it gave reproducible results, and that 
a definite change in pH occurred at the equivalence point.
The glass electrode was of the bulb type, constructed from 
Corning 015 glass tubing, containing an internal silver-silver 
chloride electrode (11, 13, 38)  immersed in 0.1 N hydrochloric 
acid. The calomel cell (11) was made from 12-mm. Pyrex 
tubing with a fine Pyrex sintered-glass plate sealed into the 
lower end. Over this was placed a 4-cm. layer of agar to reduce 
diffusion. The cell proper was made of 5-mm. soft-glass tubing 
containing a small hole for contact with the outer potassium 
chloride solution. The assembled electrode is shown in Figure
1. The electrometer used was a Leeds & Northrup, Model 
7660, single vacuum tube instrument.
Since the glass electrode is subject to sodium-ion errors, 
some means of estimating or compensating for them was 
necessary. The original data of Dole (11, 12)  and Jordan 
(31) on these errors were examined and by changing the 
constants in Jordan’s equation to fit the data of Dole and 
Weiner (14) an empirical equation was found from which 
these errors could be calculated at sodium-ion concentrations 
of 0.1, 1.0, and 3.5 M . Using this equation, log A E  — 0.54 
pH' + 0.60 (log concentration N a+ ) — 4.35, the agreement 
between calculated and experimental data was good and 
showed that this error did not exceed 3 millivolts up to a pH of
9.0 and a sodium-ion concentration of 1.0 M at 25° C. The 
sodium-ion errors are greatly affected by change in temperature 
(21, 48).  The glass electrode was also calibrated and checked 
daily against buffer solutions at 25° C. to correct for asym­
metry potential.
A study of the effect of the initial pH upon this titration 
showed that consistent results were obtained only when the 
initial pH was between 7.0 and 9.0. Under these conditions 
the calculated and theoretical volumes of cerous nitrate 
agreed within 4 parts per thousand.
A determination of the effect of the initial volume and the 
amounts of fluorine that can be determined was made by 
titrating solutions containing 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 30 mg. of 
fluorine with 0.01 M cerous nitrate at various dilutions. 
The solutions were always adjusted to a pH of 8 and dilutions 
giving a change of less than 7 millivolts at the equivalence 
point were not considered. The results for the titration 
of 2, 4, and 8 mg. of fluorine in 10 ml. are given in Table I 
and Figure 2. These data are the average of three titrations.~L
©
Fig u r e  1The results indicated that the amount of fluorine is best 
kept between 1  and 10 mg. and that the initial volume should 
be 10 to 20 ml. The theoretical volumes are based on in­
dependent standardization and the assumption that CeF3  
is formed.
Since the organic compounds are to be decomposed with 
sodium peroxide and then neutralized with nitric acid, the 
most important salt to be considered for the effect of neutral 
salts is sodium nitrate. This was determined by titrating 
2 mg. of fluorine in 10 ml. of water at 25° C. in the presence 
of varying amounts of sodium nitrate. The sodium nitrate 
effectively reduced the magnitude of the change in potential 
at the equivalence point. A satisfactory change in potential 
at the equivalence point and stoichiometric results were 
obtained up to a concentration of 1.0 M in sodium nitrate, 
but at higher concentrations the volume of cerous nitrate 
used was about 1  per cent too small.

Sodium chloride, bromide, and iodide showed the same 
effect but, in general, the amount of these salts introduced 
from the organic compounds will be small and their con­
tribution to the total salt concentration can be neglected. 
Sulfates interfered badly and must be absent. The presence 
of 2 mg. of sodium sulfate in 10 ml. made it impossible to 
detect the equivalence point. Perchlorates interfered seri­
ously when there was more than 0.04 gram of sodium per­
chlorate in 10 ml. The presence of perchlorates did not elimi-
Fic u k e  2
nate the potential change at the equivalence point but 
displaced it so as to give high results. Carbonates inter­
fered, giving high results due to the precipitation of the 
cerous ion, but can be removed by careful neutralization and 
boiling. Any other ion which acts as a buffer or precipitates 
either fluoride or cerous ion will also cause trouble, but the 
above ions are the only ones which will ordinarily be 
encountered.
Kurtenacker and Jurenka (34) recommended that the 
titration be made at 80° C. The effect of temperature was 
examined by comparing the titration of like amounts of 
fluorine at 25° and 90° C. The change in e. m. f. at the 
equivalence point at the higher temperature was about 
twice that at 25° C. and the equilibrium was established 
much more rapidly, but the volume of cerous nitrate used 
was about 1 per cent too large. While the titration gave 
good results with pure solutions, the presence of neutral salts 
presented a serious interference, especially with visual 
titrations. However, this effect was lessened by titration 
in hot solution.
If 50 per cent ethyl alcohol was used as the solvent and 
the titration made at 90° C. the change in pH at the equiva­
lence point was increased again to a surprising degree and 
equilibrium was quickly established. This was shown by 
two titrations of 1.5 mg. of fluorine in the presence of 1.7 
grams of sodium nitrate at 90° C. in 20 ml. of water and in 
20 ml. of 50 per cent alcohol. Both solutions were adjusted 
initially to a faint pink color with phenolphthalein. The 
change in e. m. f. at the equivalence point with alcohol was 
twice that with water, but the volume of cerous nitrate 
used was 5 per cent higher than the theoretical volume with 
water. No satisfactory means exists of correlating the 
e. m. f. of the glass electrode with the absolute pH in non- 
aqueous solvents but it can be used to follow changes in 
pH, as has been shown by Schicktanz and Etienne (51) and 
Evans and Davenport (19). These titrations indicated that, 
if a compensation is made for the nontheoretical relationship 
by standardizing the cerous nitrate solution under the 
same conditions, the addition of ethyl alcohol is desirable 
whenever appreciable amounts of sodium nitrate are present.
Decomposition of Com pound
An attempt to devise a general method for the decom­
position of stable, solid, organic fluorine compounds on the 
combustion method of Hubbard and Henne (SO) was un­
successful. The results obtained were invariably low.
Although no single comprehensive investigation has been 
made to test the general applicability of the Parr bomb 
fusion for the decomposition of organic fluorine compounds, 
the work of Hahn and Reid (24) , Bigelow (8), Locke, Brode, 
and Henne (37), and Miller (41) on individual compounds 
indicated that it might be suitable. Elek and Hill (16) 
and Beamish (6) used this method for the other halogens, 
but their procedure failed to give complete combustion of 
25 to 50 mg. of fluorine compounds. The following procedure, 
however, was found to give satisfactory results.
About 20 to 50 mg. of the compound, representing at least
5 mg. of fluorine, were taken. Solid compounds must be finely 
ground and can be weighed in small weighing tubes (48). Liquids 
or low-melting solids can be handled most conveniently in the 
small, No. 1, gelatin capsules of Parke, Davis and Co. The 
charge was made up of 3 grams of sodium peroxide, 100 mg. 
of sugar, and 300 mg. of potassium nitrate, finely ground, thor­
oughly mixed, and stored in a glass-stoppered vial. When 
solids were analyzed the weighed, finely ground sample was 
placed in the nickel microbomb cup, one-half the charge added, 
thoroughly mixed, and the rest of the charge added. With 
liquids, a small amount of the charge was placed in the bomb, 
and the closed capsule containing the liquid was seated in the3 4 4
center of the charge, pressed to the bottom of the cup, and 
then covered completely with the peroxide charge. Normally 
the complete charge was not used, but the cup should be filled 
to within about 0.3 cm. (0.125 inch) of the top. The lid was 
clamped firmly in position, the bottom of the bomb was held 
in a strong Bunsen flame, and after a disturbance was felt the 
bomb was cooled with tap water. If no disturbance was felt 
the bomb was heated about 20 to 30 seconds before cooling. 
With the semimicrobomb a sample of 100 to 150 mg. was used 
with a charge of 8 to 9 grams of sodium peroxide and 300 mg. 
of sugar. The bomb was heated over a strong Bunsen flame 
or Fisher burner until the water in the cooling ring evaporated.
After the bomb was cooled and rinsed, the contents were 
dissolved in a small amount of water in a 125-ml. Erlenmeyer 
flask and the solution was boiled to destroy the peroxide. A 
slight residue of carbon apparently does not affect the accuracy 
of the determination. The solution was adjusted to the pale 
pink color of cresol red with strong nitric acid and sodium 
hydroxide and heated, until the color no longer changed on 
boiling, to remove the carbon dioxide.Vol. 15, No. 5
Fig u r e  3
Practically all the nickel precipitated during this process. 
The nickel precipitate was filtered off and washed thoroughly, the 
filtrate was adjusted to a volume of 20 to 30 ml., and the neutral­
ization was completed with 0.1 N nitric acid. During this 
neutralization the solution should be alternately adjusted to a 
faint pink color and boiled until 3 to 4 drops of the nitric acid 
change the color to a clear yellow and the color remains unchanged 
after 2 minutes’ gentle boiling. The solution was cooled and 
transferred directly to a 50-ml. measuring flask, if no more 
nickel had precipitated; otherwise it was filtered again, as 
the titration fails in the presence of any nickel precipitate. The 
solution was diluted to 50-ml. and 10-ml. aliquot portions were 
taken for the titration.
Attempts to carry out the decomposition by the above 
procedure in a steel semimicrobomb were unsuccessful, as 
the iron was not removed completely. Some further modi­
fication, which will completely remove the iron, is necessary 
before this procedure can be used with a steel bomb.
The fluoride ion may now be titrated either electrometri- 
cally or visually.
Electrometric T itration
The 10-ml. portion of the neutralized solution of fluoride, 
containing between 1  and 6 mg. of fluorine so as to be able 
to titrate with a 10-ml. buret, was placed in a 50-ml. beaker. 
The concentration of sodium nitrate should not exceed 2 M . 
Ten milliliters of alcohol were added and the beaker was placed 
on a small electric hot plate clamped to a ring stand. A small 
electric glass stirrer and the electrodes were introduced into the 
solution. While the solution was heating, one drop of phenol­
phthalein was added and the solution was adjusted with 0.001 N 
sodium hydroxide and nitric acid to a faint pink color. After 
the solution began to boil, the hot plate was adjusted to low 
heat and the pH of the solution readjusted if necessary. When 
the initial e. m. f. had become steady the fluorine was titrated 
with 0.01 N cerous nitrate until the maximum change in e. m. f. 
per unit volume of cerous nitrate was obtained.INDUSTRIAL AND ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY

Visual T itration
The titration of pure sodium fluoride with cerous nitrate 
using methyl red gives little trouble when the solution is 
kept near the boiling point. However, the presence of neutral 
salts such as sodium nitrate in 1  molar concentration in aqueous 
solution makes the equivalence point very difficult to detect 
and renders the titration practically useless. Under the 
same conditions as used for the electrometric titration the 
visual titration with methyl red gave satisfactory results.
For this titration, 0.1 N and 0.001 N solutions of both nitric 
acid and carbonate-free sodium hydroxide, a special titration 
flask, a flashed opal screen with a daylight light bulb, a saturated 
solution of methyl red in ethyl alcohol, a 0.02 per cent solution 
of cresol red, and a 0.04 per cent solution of bromocresol green 
are required.
The titration flask (Figure 3), suggested and designed by 
W. T. Miller, is made of two 200-ml. round-bottomed Pyrex 
flasks, connected with a short curved tube which allows the 
solution to be poured back and forth between the two flasks. 
The complete titration must be carried out in front of the flashed 
opal screen, as the color changes of the indicators are too delicate 
to be observed clearly in ordinary light.
A 10-ml. aliquot portion of the neutral fluoride solution was 
placed in one side of the double flask and 10 ml. of 95 per cent 
alcohol were added. Three drops of cresol red were added, and 
the solution was adjusted to a definite pink color, and then 
brought to a gentle boil. The solution was then made acid 
with 1  or 2 drops of 0.1 N nitric acid in excess and the solution 
was boiled gently for 2 minutes, to remove all carbon dioxide. 
If the solution remains clear yellow during this period, the 
carbonate has been removed. The solution was then adjusted 
to a very faint pink color with the 0.001 N solutions of acid and 
base. The solution should be poured freely from one side of 
the double flask to the other, so that it remains constant in 
composition.
Two drops of the saturated methyl red and one drop of bromo­
cresol green were added. This mixed indicator was recom­
mended by Hubbard and Henne (SO). The initial color of the 
solution should be a clear green. The solution was now titrated 
drop by drop, being boiled and agitated at frequent intervals. 
When the color became a light orange, the solution was divided 
evenly between the two flasks and one more drop of cerous 
nitrate added to one portion of the solution. The color difference 
between the two halves was noted. The two portions were 
reunited, poured back and forth several times, Drought to a 
boil, and divided equally again. Another drop of cerous nitrate 
was added and the difference in color again noted. This pro­
cedure was repeated until a maximum color difference was 
observed.
The results in the previous sections confirm those of 
Kurtenacker and Jurenka that when fluoride, in hot 50 per 
cent alcohol and in the presence of sodium nitrate, is titrated 
with cerous nitrate either with a glass electrode or with an 
indicator, the result is not the stoichiometric relationship 
found in pure aqueous solution. Therefore, the cerous 
nitrate solution must be standardized against a known 
amount of sodium fluoride under the same conditions of 
concentration of sodium nitrate, temperature, and solvent.The potassium nitrate in the fusion mixture and any halogen 
contained in the organic compound may be neglected with 
regard to their contribution to the total salt concentration.
Using the above outlined procedure nine organic fluorine 
compounds were analyzed. The results obtained are given 
in Table I I  and in many cases are the average of several 
analyses on varying weights of samples.
Since the fluoride ion cannot be titrated with cerous 
nitrate in the presence of the sulfate ion, attempts were 
made to modify the proposed procedure to secure a separation. 
The distillation from perchloric acid, as advocated by Willard 
and Winter (60), was tried with p-methylbenzenesulfonyl- 
fluoride after decomposition in a microbomb, but low results 
were always obtained. Evidently the presence of a large 
amount of sodium perchlorate makes the quantitative re­
covery of fluorine impossible. Others have reported this 
same difficulty with natural waters when the salt concentra­
tion was appreciable. However, Scott and Henne (52) 
claimed a successful distillation from biological material 
ashed with calcium oxide.
Attempts to separate the sulfate ion by precipitation as 
barium sulfate always gave low results, probably because of 
the precipitation of barium fluoride in the 50 per cent alcohol 
solutions. Hoskins and Ferris (29) reported the same diffi­
culty in the titration of fluorine with thorium nitrate in the 
presence of the barium ion.
The best method, at present, for determining fluorine in 
the presence of sulfate appears to be that of Starck (55) 
and Hawley (25) with the titration by the Volhard method 
(28). An analysis of p-inethylbenzenesulfonylfluoride by 
this method gave 11.2 ± 0.1 per cent fluorine.
Two different explanations have been offered for the 
observed color change of methyl red in this titration. Kur­
tenacker and Jurenka (34) stated that this is due to a change 
in pH at the equivalence point caused by the hydrolysis of 
the excess cerous nitrate. Batchelder and Meloche (5) 
think that the methyl red behaves as an adsorption indicator. 
During the titration there is a definite flocculation of the 
gelatinous cerous fluoride precipitate and these experiments 
have shown that a clearly defined change in pH occurs at 
the equivalence point. However, the pH change obtained 
is somewhat greater than can be accounted for on the basis 
of hydrolysis, even assuming that the cerous ion undoubtedly 
exists as a coordination complex. Moreover, considering 
the effects of alcohol and temperature, it is evident that a 
rather complex condition exists and neither of the above 
explanations is entirely adequate.
Sum m ary
The effects of the initial pH, initial volume, temperature, 
and the presence of alcohol and several neutral salts, es­
pecially sodium nitrate, on the titration of fluoride ion with 
cerous nitrate have been studied.
The equivalence point of the titration can be determined 
either electrometricaliy with a glass electrode or visually 
with methyl red as indicator. This titration in general is 
capable of yielding results with an accuracy of ± 1 per cent. 
The electrometric determination is superior and should be 
employed where the highest possible accuracy is desired. 
However, when little or no neutral sodium salts are present, 
the visual titration is satisfactory and yields results which 
compare favorably with the electrometric determination.
The determination of fluorine, in both aliphatic and 
aromatic compounds, based on the decomposition of the 
compound by the sodium peroxide fusion in a nickel Parr 
microbomb and titration with 0.01 N cerous nitrate has been 
outlined. The accuracy of the determination is ±1 per 
cent.L  E  D  I  T  I  O  N  3 4 5

Sulfate and perchlorate ions interfere. The titration of 
fluorine with cerous nitrate cannot be carried out in the 
presence, of the sulfate ion. An alternate method for this 
type of compound has been suggested. The presence of 
perchlorate is neither desirable nor necessary.

Extraction and Colorimetric Estimation o f  
Certain Metals as Derivatives o f  
8-Hydroxy quinoline
THERALD M O E L L E R , Noyes Chem ical Laboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana, III.
ALTHOUGH methods involving the use of 8-hydroxy- 
l_  quinoline as a quantitative precipitant have been 
extensively investigated and widely used ( 5), but little 
attention has been devoted to colorimetric estimations 
based upon this reagent. The lack of general applicability 
of colorimetric procedures is probably traceable to the 
complexity or indirectness of those methods which have been 
suggested.
Among the colorimetric methods proposed are the following:
Aluminum arid magnesium through coupling of the S-hydroxy- 
quinoline derivatives with sulfanilic acid, followed by colori­
metric estimations in terms of the dyes so produced (2, 3);  
bismuth through extraction of the 8-hydroxyquinoline complex 
with a 3 to 1  acetone-amyl acetate mixture and color com­
parison of the extract (19); iron through solution of the pre­
cipitated ferric complex in ethanol followed by colorimetric 
observation of the resulting solution (IS); magnesium (6, 22),  
calcium (6, 22),  and bismuth, aluminum, and zinc (21) through 
the colors produced by reactions of the 8-hydroxyquinoline de­
rivatives with Folin’s reagent (10); magnesium by addition of 
excess 8-hydroxyquinoline and colorimetric estimation of the 
excess after removal of the precipitated magnesium complex
(14); magnesum by development of color through reaction of theprecipitated derivative with ferric chloride in acetic acid (12); 
and iron ( 1), aluminum (/), and indium. (16) through extraction 
of the colored complexes with chloroform and direct colorimetric 
observation of the diluted extracts.
For simplicity of operation, the last of these methods would 
appear particularly advantageous, consisting as it does in a 
mere extraction of an aqueous solution, adjusted to an ap­
propriate pH value, with a solution of 8-hydroxyquinoline 
in chloroform, layer separation, and observation of the 
spectral transmittancy of the extract at a predetermined 
wave length. The sensitivity of the method for the accurate 
estimation of small quantities of iron, aluminum, and indium 
(1, 16)  has been demonstrated.
It is the purpose of this paper to present data relative to 
the necessary conditions for the extraction of the complexes 
of cobalt, nickel, bismuth, and cupric copper, spectrophoto- 
metric data for solutions of these complexes in chloroform 
and data relative to the possible estimation of small amounts 
of these elements by this procedure. Inasmuch as a re­
investigation of the method as applied to iron and aluminum 
has yielded results significantly different from those reported
May 15, 1943 ANALYTICAL EDITION
by Alexander (1), it has been deemed advisable to include 
these elements as well.
Apparatus and Materials
All colorimetric measurements were made with the Cenco- 
Sheard spectrophotelometer (SO) previously employed (16), 
using cells of 1-em. (±0.5 per cent) thickness with a slit width 
of 5 mu. Measurements of pH were made with a Beckman 
Laboratory Model G pH meter (16).
Chloroform and 8-hydroxyquinoline were of the same purities 
as previously reported (16), and chloroform was recovered by 
the same procedure (16), except that 12 N hydrochloric acid 
proved to be a better extracting agent. All other chemicals 
were of analytical reagent quality and were used without further 
purification.
Spectrophotometric Exam ination of Chloroform 
Solutions of 8-Hydroxy quinoline Derivatives
Since in a preliminary investigation it was found that of the 
8-hydroxyquinoline derivatives of aluminum, ferric iron, 
cuprie copper, bismuth, cobalt, and nickel prepared and 
dried by the recommended methods (5) only the first three 
dissolved at all readily in chloroform, spectrophotometric 
studies were made upon solutions of these materials as 
extracted from aqueous salt solutions at appropriate pH 
values.80o

been pointed out (1, 16),  the use of constant and controlled 
conditions of extraction obviates this difficulty.
Extraction and Colorimetric Estim ation
Extraction of metallic ions from aqueous solutions as 
derivatives of 8-hydroxyquinoline is as closely dependent 
upon pH (1, 16)  as is their precipitation by that reagent 
(8, 9, 18).  Optimum pH ranges for extraction were deter­
mined as previously reported (16), using nitrate, sulfate, or 
chloride solutions containing in 25 ml. the equivalent of 
20 mg. (10 mg. for iron) of the metal per liter of chloroform 
and adjusted to appropriate pH values with 0.1 N sulfuric 
acid or sodium acetate, extracting four times with 5-ml. 
portions of 0.01 M 8-hydroxyquinoline, and examining the 
extracts at appropriate wave lengths after dilution to 50 ml., 
the per cent extraction then resulting from application of 
calibration curves (Figure 3). Data so obtained are plotted 
in Figure 2.
Transmittancy data obtained at the wave lengths pre­
viously given for extracts made within the optimum pH 
ranges indicated in Figure 2 and containing the equivalent 
of 5, 10, 15, and 20 mg. of metal per liter of chloroform are 
plotted in Figure 3. Lack of intersection with the logarithm 
of 100 per cent transmittancy at zero concentration is due to 
the measurable transmittancy of the reagent in chloroform.
Ir o n. Data in Figure 2 confirm the observation of Alexander
(1) that ferric iron is completely extracted at pH 2.0, although 
complete extraction was obtained here at pH 1.9. Inasmuch as 
completeness of extraction falls off above pH 3.0, owing to 
hydrous oxide formation (16), optimum conditions for the re­
moval of iron are in the pH range 1.9 to 3.0.
Although Alexander (1) reported the colorimetric estimation 
of iron at 540 mp, data in Figure 1  indicate the greater desir­
ability of using the 470 and 570 mm bands. At either of these 
wave lengths, the color system obeys Beer’s law rigidly in a 
concentration range at least up to 20 mg. of the metal per liter 
of chloroform (or up to 1  mg. of iron in 25 ml. of aqueous solu­
tion), although absorption at the lower wave length is so strong 
as to make reading difficult at higher concentrations (Figure 3).

visible spectrum (Figure 1) coupled with the low extraction pH2

In Figure 1  are given curves showing the spectral trans- 
mittancies of these complexes over the wave length range 
350 to 700 m/x. In all cases except ferric iron, solutions con­
tained the equivalents of 20 mg. of the metals per liter of 
chloroform; for ferric iron it was 10 mg. Included for pur­
poses of comparison is a curve obtained for a solution pre­
pared by dilution of 20 ml. of 0.01 M 8-hydroxyquinoline 
(“oxine”) in chloroform to 50 ml.
Although the absorption bands for the metallic derivatives 
are all broad, maximum absorption is noted definitely at the 
following wave lengths: iron, 470 and 570 m/x; aluminum, 
bismuth, and nickel, 395 m/i; cobalt, 420 m/n; and copper, 
410 m /Li. Furthermore, in the region around 400 m/i, chloro­
form solutions of 8-hydroxyquinoline, although apparently

would cause ferric iron to interfere with the determination of 
certain other metąls—e. g., copper, bismuth, and indium (16).
A lum in u m . Although Alexander (1) reported complete 
extraction of aluminum at pH 3.5, data in Figure 2 indicate 
complete removal only in the pH interval 4.3 to 4.6, extraction 
again falling off at higher pH values. Partial extraction was 
noted in the pH interval 2.6 to 4.3, and within the optimum 
range complete extraction was attained only with difficulty. 
The use of higher reagent concentrations might improve the 
results.
Strict conformity to Beer’s law at 395 m.u is not shown by 
chloroform solutions of the aluminum complex, although devia­
tion in the range up to 20 mg. is insufficient to interfere with the 
method. Estimation of iron and aluminum in the same sample 
as reported by Alexander (1) appears to offer no difficulty, since 
iron extracts completely at pH values below those for aluminum 
extraction.
B ism u th . Extraction of the yellow bismuth complex is 
complete in the pH range 4.0 to 5.2 and proceeds readily. At 
higher pH values, incomplete extraction is again noted. Refer­
ence to Figure 3 indicates but little deviation (at 395 m^i) from 
Beer’s law up to 10 mg. of the metal per liter of chloroform, 
although differences become more marked at higher concentra­
tions. Use of this method for the estimation of bismuth should 
present no difficulties.
C o b a lt. Although extraction of the cobalt complex begins 
around pH 3.5, complete removal occurs only at pH 6.8 or above. 
At appropriate pH values, extraction offers no difficulties, and 
complete removal of cobalt from the aqueous layer can usually 
be effected by two extractions. At 420 mu, the slightly orangish 
chloroform solutions of the complex conform exactly to Beer’s 
law up to 10 mg. of the metal per liter, but deviations at higher 
concentrations are marked.
N ic k e l. Extraction of the nickel derivative begins just 
above pH 2.5 but is complete only at pH 6.7 or above. Deviations 
of the yellow chloroform solutions of the complex from Beer’s 
law at 395 m^ are minor up to 10 mg. of the metal per liter but 
become more pronounced at higher concentrations. Quanti­
tative estimation of nickel by this method should offer few 
difficulties.
C opper. As is shown in Figure 2, extraction of the copper 
complex was complete at all investigated pH values in the 
range 2.7 to 7.0. Qualitative observations have indicated the 
complete removal of copper from ammoniacal solutions as well, 
an indication of the stability of the resulting compound.
At 410 mju, the yellow chloroform solutions of the copper 
derivative approach" Beer’s law closely up to concentrations of 
10 mg. of the metal per liter, with deviations becoming some­
what greater at higher concentrations.
Estimation of copper by this method is readily and accurately 
effected in the absence of other extractable cations, and the 
wide pH range of copper extraction permits a considerable 
choice of suitable pH values. Inasmuch as the estimation of 
copper in the presence of cadmium and zinc is often necessary 
and the cadmium and zinc derivatives of 8-hydroxyquinolinehave been found not to extract at least below;  
pH 5.5 (IS), it was of interest to apply the above, 
procedure to copper-cadmium and copper-zinc solu­
tions. The accuracy and feasibility of the estima­
tion of small amounts of copper in the presence of 
at least forty times as much of these elements are 
in dicated by data obtained by the extraction, of 
25-ml. aqueous sulfate solutions adjusted to pH 
4.0 and containing in all cases the equivalent 
of 10.0 mg. of copper per liter of chloroform 
plus a varying quantity of the other metal. The 
transmittancy of the solution containing copper 
(at 410 m/i) was unaffected by as much as 400 mg. 
of cadmium or zinc. It appears not unlikely that 
the method would be applicable in the •  presence 
of even larger amounts of cadmium or zinc.
Although all the elements except iron here 
investigated give 8-hydroxyquinoline derivatives 
the chloroform solutions of which show maximum 
absorption in the region around 400 mu, thereby 
imparting to the method a lack of specificity, it is 
apparent that through proper pH control and in 
the absence of interfering cations a method is 
available for the accurate determination of iron, 
aluminum, bismuth, cobalt, nickel, and copper in 
amounts up to at least 1  mg. in 25 ml. of aqueous 
solution. In those instances where one metal 
can be completely extracted at a pH below that at which a 
second metal extracts, separate determinations of the two 
are possible. This has already been reported for iron and 
aluminum ( 1) and the data here presented indicate that it 
should be possible to estimate iron in the presence of bismuth, 
cobalt, or nickel; copper in the presence of cobalt and possibly 
in the presence of nickel or aluminum; and copper in the 
presence of cadmium or zinc.
Extraction of metallic derivatives of 8-hydroxyquinoline 
and their precipitation from aqueous solution appear, in 
several instances, to be closely related to hydrous oxide or 
hydroxide precipitation. This is brought out by the pH 
data summarized in Table I, from which it is apparent that 
pH values for these three phenomena are most closely re­
lated with ferric iron, indium, aluminum, and bismuth. 
W ith copper, quinolate precipitation and extraction occur 
at a lower pH than hydrous hydroxide formation, while 
with cobalt and nickel, quinolate extraction and hydrous 
oxide formation agree but are at higher pH values than 
quinolate precipitation. Further investigations along these 
lines should be profitable.

Spectrophotometric examinations of chloroform solutions 
of certain metal derivatives of 8-hydroxyquinoline indicate 
the following absorption maxima: ferric iron, 470 and 570 m/x; 
aluminum, bismuth, and nickel, 395 m/i; cobalt, 420 m/t; 
and copper, 410 mju.
Agitation of aqueous solutions containing these metallic 
ions with a chloroform solution of 8-hydroxyquinoline leads

to complete extraction of the metallic complexes in the fol­
lowing optimum pH ranges: iron, 1.9 to 3.0; aluminum,
4.3 to 4.6; bismuth, 4.0 to 5.2; cobalt, 6.8 or above; nickel, 
6.7 or above; and copper, 2.7 to at least 7.0. At pH values 
below the lower limits, partial extraction to no extraction 
will occur.
Chloroform solutions containing the equivalents of up 
to 20 mg. of these metals per liter (or 1  mg. of the metal in the 
aqueous solution extracted) show little or no deviation from 
Beer’s law at the wave lengths given and thus lend them­
selves to use in accurate colorimetric determinations.
Copper can be determined in the presence of at least forty 
times as much cadmium or zinc by extraction at pH 4.0 
and transmittancy measurement at 410 mju.
An interesting correlation between pH values for hydrous 
oxide or hydroxide formation, quinolate precipitation, and 
quinolate extraction is given.

An Improved Meter for the Measurement of  
Gas Flow Rates
W . G . A P P L E B Y  AND W . H . A V E R Y  
H o usto n Refinery Research Laboratory, SheU O il C o m p any , Incorporated, H o usto n, Texas
IN THE study of reaction kinetics in flow systems, accurate 
measurement of the rate of flow of the intake and exit 
gases is essential. Flow-measuring instruments in common 
use are of two types: (A) meters that measure some function 
of the gas velocity— for example, the pressure drop across an 
orifice or the rate at which heat is conducted away from a 
heated wire— and (B) instruments that involve displacement 
of a liquid by the gas and continuous or discontinuous meas­
urement of the volume displaced in unit time. The familiar 
wet-test meter is an example of this type. ' Both types of in­
struments, as commercially available, have disadvantages, 
particularly if flow rates of the order of 25 cc. per minute or 
smaller are to be measured. Type A requires a separate cali­
bration curve for each kind of gas, hence is not suited for use 
with mixtures of unknown composition, such as the gaseous 
product of a thermal reaction. Type B requires estimation of 
and correction for the effect of the vapor pressure of the dis­
placed liquid and for the solubility of some components of the 
mixture in the liquid. Meters of this type are therefore un­
suitable for the measurement of intake rates.
The flowmeter shown diagTammatically in Figure 1  is an im­
proved form of a meter described by Marsh (?) for measurement 
of very slow flow rates. The new type of meter is free from the 
disadvantages of the usual instruments in common use. The 
operation is clearly shown by the diagram.
Referring to the side view, gas enters at A, passes down the 
vertical tube, and forces a drop of mercury, D, to the right in the 
horizontal tube. Stopcocks < S 'i and S2 are open; Ss is closed. 
When the drop reaches the end of the tube at E, the gas trapped 
behind the drop is discharged. However, as soon as the dropSIDE VIEW

3 5 0 INDUSTRIAL AND ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY Vol. 15, No. 5
begins to flow into the 13-mm. bulb at E, the mercury level is 
pushed up at C, so that a new drop is forced into the horizontal 
tube, trapping a new segment of the gas stream. This drop then 
moves to the right and the cycle is repeated.
Thus, each cycle represents the flow of a definite volume of 
gas and the time between cycles is a measure of the flow rate. 
For low flow rates the time required for movement of the 
drop between two fixed points may be a more convenient 
measure of the rate.
Fig u r e  2
Figure 2 shows a calibration curve obtained with hydrogen 
and with nitrogen, when gas volumes were measured by col­
lection over water in suitable burets. The points for the gases 
are seen to fall accurately on the same line. The use of mer­
cury as a displacement fluid eliminates the difficulties caused 
by use of water or organic liquids in the usual wet-test meters.
Some details of the construction and operation of the flowmeter 
need further discussion. The glass spirals permit small adjust­
ments in the tilt of the tube, which controls the size of the drop. 
Since there is a lag between the time at which the drop begins to 
flow into the bulb at E and the time at which the mercury rises 
at C, the drop must be of sufficient length to ensure that mercury 
will enter the horizontal tube at C before the drop at the right is 
entirely discharged from the tube. If this condition is not met, 
a jet of gas will flow through the tube during a part of each cycle. 
The amount of gas will be a function of the gas viscosity and the 
calibration curve will then be found to depend on the kind of gas.
The requirement that there must be a drop of mercury in the 
horizontal tube at every part of the cycle suggests the use of a 
tube of relatively large diameter and as short as possible for the 
mercury piston, in order to reduce the time lag. However, in 
such a tube the mercury level tends to oscillate for some time after 
a drop is discharged at E, thereby producing a series of drops at 
the left instead of one. The constriction in the vertical tube at 
F reduces these oscillations; the long zigzag horizontal tube, 
shown in the top view, ensures complete damping of the oscilla­
tions of one cycle before the second begins and minimizes pos­
sible errors from fluctuations in the size of the mercury drops. 
In the authors’ instrument 2 drops are formed at the beginning 
of every cycle when the flow rate becomes greater than 15 ce. per 
minute and as this rate is approached there will be 1  drop one 
cycle and 2 the next. However, the total volume of mercury re­
mains very nearly constant, as the calibration curve proves. 
Above 35 cc. per minute 3 drops are formed. The tungsten con­
tacts shown in the top view actuate a counter through a relay, so 
that the instrument may be used to record total flow as well as to 
measure the rate.The surface of the tubing through which the gas and mercury 
droplets flow should be free of any oil or water film or dust par­
ticles, and the mercury should be pure; otherwise there will be 
small fluctuations in the rate of gas flow which may give pressure 
variations as high as 1  or 2 mm. of mercury. This effect can be 
eliminated in any case, however, by having a surge chamber in 
the line following the meter.
Since the volume displacement per cycle does not depend on 
the pressure or temperature of the gas, the instrument may be 
used at subatmospheric pressures. During any particular 
run, however, the temperature and pressure should have con­
stant values; otherwise it would be difficult to convert the 
gas volumes to standard conditions. The meter could also 
be adapted for use at superatmospheric pressures by using 
metal parts or suitable plastic tubing and connections.

Forceps with Platinum-Covered Tips
EA RL W . BA LIS AND H ERM A N  A. LIE B H A FSK Y  
Research Laboratory, General Electric Co., 
Schenectady, N. Y.
THE usual platinum-tipped forceps commercially avail­
able have each platinum tip fastened to nickel-plated 
steel by means of two rivets in a simple scarf joint. During 
the past five years, three or four of these expensive tools 
have failed here, ahvays owing to corrosion or oxidation 
where the two metals join. Even moderate attack of the 
steel soon renders the forceps unfit for use because the 
platinum alone is too weak to withstand the flexing that occurs 
at the rivet holes.
Forceps that are stronger, cheaper, and more durable 
than those just described have been made in this laboratory 
by covering the tips of ordinary steel forceps with 5-mil 
platinum foil. The tips of the steel forceps were filed to the 
shape desired and a piece of foil (0.8 X  2.5 cm.) was fitted 
to each, so that the seam would fall outside. A close fit 
was obtained by slitting the lower edge of the foil so that 
it could be folded around the end of the tip; excess foil was 
then carefully trimmed away. Spot-welding to form a 
practically continuous seam completed the assembly. The 
welding operation is simple with the proper equipment. In 
this case, a low inertia bench welder with synchronous 
thyratron control was used under the following conditions: 
350 amperes for 6 cycles, or 0.1 second; electrode pressure, 
20 pounds; flat copper electrodes of diameters V1 6  inch 
(lower) and V3 2  inch (upper).
The forceps thus constructed have been used constantly 
during the last six months and have given satisfactory service 
without deteriorating noticeably. There is no reason why 
the tips of a wide variety of tongs and forceps could not be 
covered with platinum foil to great advantage. The im­
plements to be covered should preferably be made of stainless 
alloys.
A Large-Scale Laboratory Extractor  
of the Soxhlet Type
KARL E. RAPP, C. W. WOODMANSEE, a n d  J. S. McHARGUE 
Kentucky Agricultural Experiment Station, Lexington, Ky.
IN CH EM ICAL investigations of agricultural products it is 
frequently necessary to extract large quantities of material. 
This problem was encountered by the authors in an investi­
gation on tobacco and its solution may be of use in other labo­
ratories.
The extractor was designed and constructed from two alcohol 
drums and other materials obtained from a plumbing shop.
In Figure 1  the distilling pot, 1, is made from a 55-gallon 
drum. Heat is supplied by a steam coil entering at valve 2. The 
solvent vapor tube, 3, made of 2-inch iron pipe and fittings, is 
welded to the drums. A 30-gallon drum comprises the extraction 
chamber, 4, with 0.5-inch pipe and fittings for the siphon tube 
return, 5. Coupling joints are provided for both vapor tube and 
siphon tube for ease in handling. Condensation is maintained 
by a spiral cone condenser head, 6, with auxiliary straight tube 
condenser, 7, connected in series to the water line. A steam- 
radiator safety valve, 8, is attached to 7 when the air has been 
forced from the system. This prevents air from being drawn in 
by the partial vacuum created each time the extract siphons over, 
resulting in the loss of solvent.
A detailed diagram of the condenser-head assembly is shown 
in Figure 2. The drumheads are cut out and flanges welded to 
the sides. The extractor heads are bolted to these flanges, being 
sealed with braided graphite-impregnated packing. Thus they
are removable for charging and cleaning. An ordinary 18-inch 
boiler gage, 9, provides a means for following the solvent level 
in the pot. The pot steam coil is so placed that the solvent level 
never falls below about 5 gallons, automatically preventing the 
extract from becoming overheated.
The ground material to be extracted is held in a heavy cotton 
bag double-sewn at the seams, which is supported on a small 
rack, 10, made of iron piping welded at the joints.
When extraction is complete the distilled solvent and concen­
trated extract solution are drawn off at taps 11 and 12, respec­
tively. Following this operation the straight tube condenser, 7, 
is connected for distillation by means of adapter 13, the spiral 
cone condenser being disconnected from the water line. Steam 
through valve 14 is then used to distill the solvent from the ex­
tracted residue in the bag. Solvent vapor passes to the condenser 
and also in reverse direction through the vapor tube, 3, and is 
condensed. That returning to the distilling pot serves to rinse 
down the sides of the drum. It is drawn off and added to the con­
centrated extract for final solvent recovery.
The capacity of this apparatus is approximately 50 pounds of 
dried plant material. With this charge the solvent requirements 
are 25 to 35 gallons, most of which is recovered after extraction.
Experiments in the last year have proved the efficiency of 
the extractor.
The investigation reported in this paper is in connection with a project of 
the Kentucky Agricultural Experiment Station and is published by per­

Direct Quantitative Determination of  
Nicotinamide in Vitamin Mixtures
FRANCES W . LAM B 
G elatin Products Com pany, Detroit, M ich.
THE method for the quanti­
tative determination of 
nicotinic acid and nicotinamide 
based on the color reaction of 
König (S) has been employed 
successfully by a number of 
workers (4-7) in the analysis 
of both biological and vitamin 
concentrate materials. A dis­
cussion of the chemistry in­
volved in this determination as 
well as references to numerous 
modifications and variations 
of the method is given in a 
review by W aism an  and 
Elvehjem (9).
However, as with other 
physicochemical methods for 
the determination of nicotinic 
acid, the method is not specific, 
since other pyridine compounds 
also produce the same color 
upon treatment with cyano­
gen bromide and an aromatic
amine. For this reason the usual practice is to hydrolyze the 
sample with either strong acid or alkali to convert other nico­
tinic acid derivatives to the free nicotinic acid. In this con­
nection Melnick, Robinson, and Field (6) have reported that 
in the analysis of urine it is possible to obtain a semiquantita- 
tive analysis of the amounts of nicotinic acid, nicotinamide, 
nicotinuric acid, and trigonelline present by determining the 
apparent “nicotinic acid” values after various hydrolysis 
treatments.
Since today approximately 90 per cent of the compounded 
synthetic vitamin mixtures contain nicotinamide rather than 
nicotinic acid, it is highly desirable to have a direct quantita­
tive method for the analysis of vitamin mixtures for nicotin­
amide. The microbiological method is not satisfactory for 
this purpose, since equimolecular weights of nicotinic acid, 
nicotinamide, and nicotinuric acid have equal activities for 
the organism used (8). In the case of the colorimetric 
method Melnick and Field (6) stated that the amide 
reacted with cyanogen bromide and aniline to give the 
same yellow color but the intensity of the color producedW ith the approval and cooperation of the 
authors concerncd, the ANALYTICAL 
EDITION presents here the results of re­
search conducted independently in  two 
laboratories on the same problem (see page 
355). Using the same fundam ental proce­
dure w ith m inor m odifications in analyti­
cal technique, the investigators acquired 
data which oiTer confirmatory evidence on 
the value of their m ethod.
T hat credit for priority in  this work m ay 
be established, it should be noted th at Dr. 
Lam b’s m ethod was w ritten up in  pre­
lim inary form  last November and sub­
m itted to this journal on M arch 2. The 
m ethod by Drs. M elnick and Oser was 
w ritten u p in February this year, and a 
m anuscript subm itted for publication on 
M arch 11.was about half that produced 
by an equal amount of nico- 
tinic acid. Shaw  and 
Macdonald (7) reported that 
when using nicotinamide the 
results were neither constant 
nor reproducible, and were 
generally lower than those ob­
tained with the acid, while 
Bandier and Hald (1), using 
Metol as the aromatic amine, 
stated that the yellow color 
produced with the amide was 
usually considerably stronger 
than that obtained with the 
acid, and that the results were 
not reproducible.
Time-reaction studies have 
been made of the intensity of 
the color produced by treating 
both nicotinic acid and nico­
tinamide with aniline and 
cyanogen bromide.
For these studies equal quantities of acid and amide were used. 
Briefly, to 50 micrograms of the acid or amide in 12 ml. of dis­
tilled water, 1  ml. of 4 per cent aniline in 95 per cent ethanol was 
added, followed by 6 ml. of cyanogen bromide reagent (approxi­
mately 4 per cent). The solutions were quickly mixed, stirred to 
free them from air bubbles, and placed in specially matched tubes. 
Using the Evelyn photoelectric colorimeter with a 420 mu filter, 
the intensity of the color produced was measured every 15 
seconds.
The results of a typical set of these measurements are 
shown graphically in Figure 1, in which corrected extinction 
(log Io /I) values are plotted against time elapsed after addi­
tion of the cyanogen bromide reagent. A number of similar 
series of measurements have established that the time-reaction 
curves for nicotinic acid and nicotinamide are equally char­
acteristic and reproducible. However, it is evident that the 
maximum intensity is reached in less time and decreases much 
faster for the amide than for the acid form. These curves also 
show that determinations based upon maximum readings are 
more reliable than determinations based upon readings taken 
at an arbitrary elapsed time of 5 minutes, since the readings

50 micrograms of nicotinic acid (1), nicotinamide (2), pyridine (3), and (3-picoline (4)
might vary considerably for a small difference in timing, par­
ticularly in the case of the amide.
The length of time for the maximum depth of color to de­
velop varies somewhat with different cyanogen bromide prep­
arations, and the rate of reaction increases with temperature. 
Various solvents have been found to change the rate of reac­
tion—methyl alcohol, for example, retards the reaction con­
siderably, the maximum color intensity for the amide being 
reached at the end of 6 to 7 minutes instead of 3 to 3.5 minutes. 
However, for normal laboratory conditions, maximum read­
ings obtained in the analysis of standard nicotinic acid and 
nicotinamide solutions repeated from time to time during an 
8-hour period were found to be reproducible to within ±2 
per cent. In Figure 2 the maximum extinction coefficients for 
both nicotinic acid and nicotinamide as obtained by the above- 
described procedure are plotted against concentrations of 
these compounds in micrograms. This relationship was 
found to be linear for 0 to 75 micrograms of nicotinamide and 
for 0 to 100 micrograms of nicotinic acid. Since Beer’s law 
fails to hold above these amounts, it is necessary to select 
sample aliquots so that the quantities of nicotinic acid and 
nicotinamide will fall within these ranges of concentration.
,  These observations form the basis of a method for the direct 
quantitative determination of nicotinamide which has been 
used successfully in the analysis of several hundred samples 
of synthetic vitamin mixtures. As with other chemical 
methods, this method is also open to criticism in that it is not 
entirely specific for either form. However, by making time- 
reaction studies it is possible to detect very quickly whether a 
material contains nicotinic acid, nicotinamide, or a mixture 
of the two, since the relationship of the extinctions of the 
resulting colors to time of their development is distinctly 
different for the acid and amide. Having determined the 
qualitative composition of the sample in respect to these sub­
stances, the material may then be analyzed for either nico­
tinic acid, its amide, or both, as described under procedure for 
analysis. If the time-reaction curve indicates that the sample 
contains a mixture of the amide and acid, it is necessary to 
make a time-reaction curve both before and after hydrolysisof the sample. Using Equation I, it 
is then' possible to calculate the 
amounts of amide and acid present. 
While the preparation of reagents, 
general procedure for analysis, and 
treatment of results are given in the 
literature, it is thought worth while 
to repeat these briefly with the inclu­
sion of a few helpful details gained 
from experience in using this method 
during the past year.
Experimental Procedure
Preparation  of R eagents . The 
cyanogen bromide reagent prepared in 
4-liter quantities as described below has 
been found to be stable when stored at 
room temperatures for 2 months or more. 
A saturated bromine solution is prepared 
by dissolving 57 ml. of bromine in 4 
liters of distilled water at 5° to 10° C. 
This solution is stirred continually while 
a 10 per cent sodium cyanide or potas­
sium cyanide solution is carefully added 
until completely decolorized. An excess 
of cyanide is to be avoided. As soon as 
the solution becomes a pale green-yellow 
its per cent transmission is measured 
after each small addition of the cyanide 
solution. When the per cent transmis­
sion of the cyanogen bromide solution 
reaches a maximum, sufficient cyanide 
solution has been added. The amount 
of 10 per cent potassium cyanide required 
to decolorize 4 liters of the saturated bromine water is roughly
725 ml. The resulting^ to 5 per cent cyanogen bromide solution
is conveniently stored in a 2-liter automatic buret, from which it 
may be easily and safely dispensed.
A 4 per cent aniline solution is prepared from c. p. aniline in 95 
per cent ethanol and stored in an amber bottle.
Standard solutions of nicotinic acid and nicotinamide are pre­
pared containing 25 micrograms per ml. in distilled water.

These standard solutions have been found to be stable as long as 2 
weeks; however, it is advisable to prepare fresh.solutions each 
week.
P r e p a r a tio n  o f  Sam ple. Aqueous solutions of samples are 
prepared to contain 1  to 30 micrograms of nicotinic acid or amide 
per ml. In the case of synthetic vitamin mixtures, tablets, and 
capsules it is convenient to place the required number in a volu­
metric flask, heat on a steam bath, and swirl until the material is 
either completely in solution or uniformly dispersed. The 
addition of 1  ml. of ethylene dichloride aids by quickly dispersing 
vitamin mixtures containing waxes, fats, oils, liver concentrates, 
etc. The solutions are then made to volume and filtered to re­
move oils, fats, waxes, and other insoluble material. The first 50 
to 100 ml. of filtrate are discarded to avoid loss of nicotinic acid 
and amide by adsorption on the filter paper. While it may not 
be accepted quantitative procedure, it has been found helpful to 
add a drop or two of a 2 per cent aerosol solution to the filtrate to 
aid in more accurate pipetting of the sample aliquots. Iron pres­
ent in appreciable amounts forms a troublesome greenish-blue 
complex with cyanide. This may be avoided by treating the 
warm solutions with potassium hydrogen phosphate, the pre­
cipitated iron phosphate being removed in the subsequent filtra­
tion.
T r e a tm e n t w ith  C y a n o g e n  B ro m id e  a n d  A n ilin e . Six 25- 
ml. glass-stoppered graduates are labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. 
Graduates 1  and 2 are reagent blanks and need to be repeated only 
once or twice daily, 3 is a solution blank, 4 is the sample, and 5 
and 6 are the sample to which known amounts of nicotinic acid or 
amide are added. If the sample contains nicotinic acid, known 
amounts of nicotinic acid are added; if the sample contains the 
amide, known amounts of nicotinamide are added. To graduates
1  and 2 are added 12 ml. of distilled water. Into 3, 4, 5, and 6 is 
pipetted 1  ml. of the sample solution containing 10 to 30 micro­
grams of acid or amide per ml. If the sample solution contains 1  
to 5 micrograms per ml., 10 ml. of the sample solution are used; 
if 5 to 10 micrograms, 5 ml. are used. Eighteen milliliters of dis­
tilled water are added to 3, and distilled water is added to 4, 5, 
and 6 to make a total volume of 12, 11.5, and 11 ml., respectively. 
One-half milliliter of the standard solution (acid or amide) is 
added to 5, and 1.0 ml. of the respective standard solution to 6. 
Next, 1  ml. of 4 per cent aniline solution is added to each of the 
six graduates, followed by 6 ml. of the cyanogen bromide reagent.
It is important to add the aniline first, since, when cyanogen 
bromide is added first, the longer the delay before adding the 
aniline the more intense is the maximum color developed. Add­
ing the aniline first, the elapsed time before adding the cyanogen 
bromide is not critical, as is shown in Table I, where the per cent 
differences for individual determinations are within the limits of 
error of the method—namely, ±2 per cent. Table II indicates 
that in the case of the amide as great as a 50 per cent increase in 
log /„// may be introduced by adding the cyanogen bromide first 
and the aniline 10 minutes later, while a delay of 8 minutes intro­
duces an increase of 12 per cent in the case of nicotinic acid. 
Advantage has been taken of this increase in photometric density 
in the collaborative method described by Melnick (4) for the 
determination of nicotinic acid in cereal products. In this 
method the cyanogen bromide is added first, followed in exactly 
10 minutes by the addition of the aniline reagent. The data in 
Table II, column 5, show the importance of exact timing when 
this procedure is followed.
As soon as cyanogen bromide reagent is added, the time is 
noted and the solutions are well mixed and immediately placed in 
specially matched test tubes. The change in per cent transmis­
sion with time is measured on an Evelyn photoelectric colorimeter 
with a 420 mju filter. Solutions 1  and 2 are read against water as a 
blank—i. e., the galvanometer is adjusted to 100 per cent trans­
mission with distilled water. Solution 3 is used to adjust the 
galvanometer to 100 per cent transmission before measuring solu­
tions 4, 5, and 6 in order to compensate for the color of the original 
sample solution. In the case of an unknown sample, it is neces­
sary to make a complete series of transmission measurements from15 seconds to 8 minutes in order to ascertain the nature of the 
sample. However, in the case of samples with known history it 
is only necessary to have each solution in the instrument in time 
to take readings before the maximum is reached, in order to be 
certain that a measurement is made at the maximum intensity. 
This is particularly important in the case of the amide, as is seen 
in Figure 1 .
T r e a t m e n t  o f  R e s u lt s . In  using an instrument such as 
the Evelyn photoelectric colorimeter, the measurements are 
made as per cent transmission which are converted to extinc­
tion coefficients (log j ) . The average value of the extinction
coefficients of the reagent blanks (solutions 1  and 2) is then 
subtracted from the extinction coefficients of sample solutions
4, 5, and 6. These corrected extinction coefficients are plotted 
as ordinates against the added amounts of nicotinic acid or 
amide as abscissas. Since it has been found that Beer’s law 
holds for these concentrations, the three points at 0, 12.5, 
and 25 micrograms of added nicotinamide or acid will deter­
mine a straight line. Extrapolation of this straight line 
through the abscissa gives the amount of nicotinic acid or nico­
tinamide, as the case may be, originally present in the sample 
aliquot. By careful technique results may be checked to 
within ±2 per cent. As stated by Harris and Raymond (2), 
the advantage of treating results in this manner lies in the 
fact that while the slope of the line may vary somewhat with 
different samples because of variations in pH, salt concentra­
tion, etc., yet the three points will still determine a straight 
line from which an accurate determination may be made.

In the analysis of samples containing both nicotinamide and 
nicotinic acid, the samples are first run directly as the amide 
and then following hydrolysis determined as total nicotinic 
acid. By use of Equation 1  the amounts of nicotinic acid and 
nicotinamide may be determined.
Let T = total micrograms of nicotinic acid plus nicotinamide

sis are equal to the actual micrograms of nicotinamide plus 
the micrograms of nicotinic acid times the factor K , the 
following equation may be written:

Discussion
In Figure 1  time-reaction curves are given for /3-picoline 
and pyridine as well as for nicotinic acid and nicotinamide. 
A comparison of these curves shows that the more polar the 
group on the beta-carbon atom of the pyridine nucleus the 
longer the time required for maximum development of color 
and the more stable the color produced. These results indi­
cate that the nature of the group on the beta-carbon atom of 
the pyridine nucleus exerts a decided influence on the mecha­
nism of the dianil reaction and on the intensity of the color of 
the resulting compound. In Figure 1  maximum extinction 
coefficients are plotted for equal quantities of compounds—  
namely, 50 micrograms. Maximum extinction coefficients 
for equimolecular quantities of the four compounds have 
been calculated from Figure 1 and tabulated in Table III. 
On an equimolecular basis the intensity of the color produced 
by these four compounds decreases in the following order:nicotinic acid, nicotinamide, pyridine, and /3-picoline. This 
is the same order as reported by Melnick, Robinson, and 
Field (6).
Sum m ary
A method for the direct quantitative analysis of com­
pounded vitamin mixtures for nicotinamide has been de­
scribed, which has been used successfully in the analysis of 
several hundred samples during the past year. Time-reaction 
measurements of the color produced by the König reaction, 
using the reagents cyanogen bromide and aniline, form the 
basis of the method. The relationship between maximum 
extinction coefficients and time for their development has 
been found to be distinctly characteristic for nicotinic acid 
and nicotinamide as well as for pyridine and /3-picoline.
A delay of a few minutes in the addition of aniline following 
the addition of cyanogen bromide introduces considerable 
error, while as much as a 15-minute delay in adding cyanogen 
bromide after first adding the aniline does not introduce an 
appreciable error.
Results obtained by this method have been found to be re­
producible to within = * = 2  per cent for the direct quantitative 
determination of either nicotinic acid or nicotinamide in vita­
min mixtures.

Chemical Differentiation between Niacinamide  
and Niacin in Pharmaceutical Products1
D A N IEL M E L N IC K  a n d  BERNARD L. OSER 
Food Research Laboratories, Inc., Long Island City, N. \  .
TTIHE microbiological method of Snell and Wright in its
JL existing forms (/, 2, 5) does not distinguish between nia­
cin and niacinamide, since both compounds exert the same 
microbiological stimulatory effects (5). By taking advantage 
of the relative reaction rates, the chemical method offers a 
means of differentiating between the free acid and the amide. 
This distinction is of no little importance, since niacin pro­
duces in many individuals an uncomfortable sensation of 
flushing and erythema of the skin; moreover, the amide is 
more expensive. In the chemical method [2, 3)  the samples 
are first subjected to acid hydrolysis to convert biologically 
active niacin derivatives to free niacin. Niacinamide, how­
ever, reacts with the reagents prior to hydrolysis to yield the 
same color as niacin but of lesser intensity ( 3). Niacinamide, 
like niacin, is quantitatively adsorbed on and eluted from 
Lloyd’s reagent and neither is lost during the lead hydroxide

two compounds in one solution are additive.
When the color reaction is carried out according to the 
collaborative chemical procedure (2), the maximal color de­
veloped (the photometric density 3 to 8 minutes after the 
addition of the aniline reagent) is 35 to 40 per cent greater 
with niacin than with an equivalent amount of niacinamide. 
With the latter, the maximal photometric density develops 
in approximately 2.5 minutes but is stable for only 30 seconds. 
If the cyanogen bromide and aniline reagents are added in 
rapid sequence as in the method of Melnick and Field (S)—
i. e., omitting the 10-minute period during which the cyano­
gen bromide alone is allowed to react— the sensitivity of the 
method for niacin is reduced by 30 to 35 per cent, but the 
maximal color due to reacted niacin is now practically twice 
that of reacted niacinamide. Figure 1  shows these differences 
in reaction rates. Readings were taken at 15-second intervals

preparation of the reagents, the hydrolysis, subsequent clari­
fication, and the setting up of the solutions for the color 
development have been described in detail elsewhere (2). 
The final color development, however, follows the earlier 
method of Melnick and Field ( 8). [For the first test of total 
niacin content the collaborative chemical procedure (2) may 
be used. However, for testing the unhydrolyzed sample the 
addition of the reagents in rapid sequence (3) is preferred, in 
order that the photometric densities of reacted niacin and 
niacinamide may show a bigger difference. The readings 
should be taken periodically during the color development, 
since maximal constant values are required for the calculation 
and the reaction, particularly with niacinamide, fades rapidly 
once the maximum is attained.]
Typical Calculation
Test substance: vitamin capsule subjected to acid hydrolysis.
Preparation of test solution: 20 capsules dissolved in 200 ml. 
of water; 1-ml. aliquot carried through the collaborative chemical 
method (2) but the maximal yellow color due to reacted niacin 
measured after the cyanogen bromide and aniline reagents were 
added in rapid sequence ( 3).
Eight milliliters of the final neutralized supernatant solution 
are diluted to 10 ml. and 3-ml. aliquots taken for testing.
0.016 = photometric density of the blank
0.438 = photometric density of the test solution
0.699 = photometric density of the test solution containing 
10 M g. of added niacinThen
0.438 —  0.016 = 0.422 photometric density due to reacted 
niacin
0.699 —  0.438 = 0.261 photometric density due to 10 M g. of

solution
16.2 X 10/3 X 15/8 X 1000/1 X 1/10 X 1/1000 = 10.1 mg. 
of total niacin per capsule
Test for niacinamide: repeat above, omitting acid hydrolysis
0.000 = photometric density of the blank
0.216 = photometric density of test solution
0.475 = photometric density of test solution containing 10 M g. 
of added niacin
0.216 —  0.000 = 0.216 photometric density due to reacted 
niacin compounds
0.475 —  0.216 = 0.259 photometric density due to 10 M g. of 
added niacin
0.216/0.259 X 10 = 8.3 M g. of apparent niacin in sample
8.3 X 10/3 X 15/8 X 1000/1 X 1/10 X 1/1000 = 5.2 mg. of 
apparent niacin per capsule
Since this is one half of the total niacin, found after hydrolysis, 
the material is present in the capsule entirely as niacinamide.
Had the above value for apparent niacin been 7.0 mg. per cap­
sule, then
10.1 -7.0  = 3.1
2
6.2 mg. of niacinamide per capsule 
and 10.1 —  6.2 = 3.9 mg. of niacin per capsule
Some latitude (=*=15 per cent) should be allowed in inter­
preting the results, since the accuracy of the partition of the 
niacin ingredient is dependent upon the precision of two assays 
and errors may be additive.
In testing samples such as pure niacin, niacinamide, or 
mixtures of the two, clear colorless solutions are obtained; 
the adsorption-elution and decolorization procedures are then 
omitted. Greater precision is also obtained. For determina­
tions conducted on pure niacin or niacinamide preparations, 
direct reference to the reaction curves in Figure 1  may suffice 
to identify and allow rapid quantitative estimation of the 
compound with a good degree of precision (±2 per cent).
The nicotinamide-containing coenzymes fail to yield a 
yellow reaction product with the reagents unless first hydro­
lyzed. Nicotinuric acid reacts with the reagents to yield some 
color prior to hydrolysis. Strong acid hydrolysis is required 
to convert it quantitatively to free niacin (4). However, 
these compounds are not readily available. The test pro­
cedure described is intended for use only in assaying the 
niacin ingredient in vitamin capsules and tablets containing 
the synthetic vitamin.

Determination of Microquantities  
of Certain Proteins
A Colorimetic Method
DAVID PRESSM AN, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, Calif.
IN CONNECTION with studies of serological reactions 
(5) it was necessary to have a simple and rapid method for 
determining quantitatively small amounts (from 10 to 1000 
micrograms) of specifically precipitated antibody globulin 
which would permit a large number of determinations in a 
short time. A colorimetric method using the Folin-Ciocalteu 
phenol reagent (S) was finally chosen. The modification of 
heating the protein in alkaline solution before the addition 
of the phenol reagent to increase the intensity of the color 
(1, 4) was also adopted.
The phenol reagent reacts with the chromogenic reducing 
groups of proteins in basic solution to give a blue color. How­
ever, the phenol reagent is decomposed rapidly by alkali, and 
thus the color developed depends on the relative rates of 
reaction of the phenol reagent with protein and with alkali. 
In most cases the protein does not react completely, and this 
cannot be remedied by use of larger amounts of the reagents, 
since then white precipitates form rapidly. Therefore, an 
empirical procedure which would give reproducible results 
was developed, and the effect of pertinent variations was 
studied.
Procedure
Add from a buret 2.5 ml. of 1.00 N sodium hydroxide solution 
to 10 to 1000 /ig. of the protein sample in a calibrated 15-ml. 
centrifuge tube and bring to a volume of 7.5 ml. with distilled 
water. Specific precipitates dissolve readily in this solution. 
Heat in a boiling water bath from 5 to 10 minutes and cool to 
about 25° C. in running tap water. Add rapidly 2.5 ml. of the 
phenol reagent (prepared as described by Polin and Ciocalt6u, 8, 
and diluted with two volumes of water) and shake well immedi­
ately. A clean rubber stopper may be used during the shaking 
without affecting the color. Let stand 10 minutes for color de­
velopment and read the color intensity with a Klett-Summerson 
photoelectric colorimeter, using a red filter transmitting 640 to 
700 mfi. If the reading is abore 450 units, dilute the solution 
two- or fourfold and multiply the observed reading by the dilution 
factor. Make a blank run at the same time, omitting the pro­
tein, and subtract the blank reading (10 to 15 units) from the pro­
tein color reading. Read the amount of protein present from a 
plot, such as that in Figure 1, of the corrected color reading against 
the weight of protein.
The author has found it convenient to run the determina­
tions in sets of twelve. By staggering the sets, one man can 
average 40 analyses per hour or two men can average 100 
analyses per hour with a single instrument.
Using simple substances as antigens (5), the author found 
that the antigen usually has a negligible chromogenic value. 
When colored proteins are used as antigens, the amount of 
antigen in the precipitate can be determined colorimetrically 
before the addition of the phenol reagent and a correction 
can be made for the chromogenic value of the antigen.
Although the same amounts of different proteins have dif­
ferent chromogenic values, the plots are similar. By changing 
the protein scale (abscissa), the plots can be made the same 
for rabbit globulin, bovine globulin, crystalline ovalbumin, 
and whole rabbit serum.
The plot of Figure 1  was made for rabbit serum globulin 
(rabbit anticrystalline ovalbumin) by the following pro­
cedure:
A solution of ovalbumin of known concentration as determined 
by Kjeldahl analysis (< ?) was added to an excess of rabbit anti­ovalbumin serum and the mixture was permitted to stand over­
night in the refrigerator. The precipitate ( ca. 12 mg.) was washed 
Uiree times with 20-ml. portions of 0.9 per cent saline, dissolved 
in 1.00 N sodium hydroxide solution, and made up to a definite 
volume as a stock solution. Aliquots of this solution were 
analyzed by the Kjeldahl method for nitrogen and the amount of 
protein was calculated by multiplying the weight of nitrogen by 
the factor 6.25. Dilutions of the stock protein solution were 
made and analyzed colorimetrically by the method outlined 
above. The amounts of protein and the color readings were 
corrected for the small amount of ovalbumin present. All the 
ovalbumin added was assumed to be in the precipitate, since the 
precipitate was obtained in the region of antibody excess. The 
experimental points used in Figure 1  were run in duplicate with 
average deviation of ~ 1.5 per cent.
The phenol reagent was checked from time to time against a 
standard solution of tyrosine in hydrochloric acid stabilized with 
formalin, as described by Anson (2), and was found to give the 
same color intensity over a period of 4 months and for three 
different preparations of the reagent. This indicates the sta­
bility and the reproducibility of the reagent.
In order to check the effect of variations from the chosen 
procedure, experiments were carried out to study the effect of 
varying the amount of sodium hydroxide used; the amount 
of phenol reagent used; the length of time of exposure to 
sodium hydroxide before, during, and after heating; the

length of time of reaction with the phenol reagent; the tem­
perature of the reactants; and the mode of addition of the 
phenol reagent. The effect of omitting the heating step was 
also studied. The experiments were carried out with a stock 
solution of bovine globulin and the volumes and time inter­
vals used were the same as those in the chosen procedure ex­
cept for the specific variation studied.
Effect of Variations
The effect of the concentration of the reagents was deter­
mined by varying each while the other was kept constant 
(Table I). It is evident that the maximum color develops 
with equal volumes of the phenol reagent and sodium hy­
droxide, and that a slight error (less than 0.05 ml.) in the 
amount of either of the reagents added would have very little 
effect on the reading. The last four determinations in Table I 
indicate that the depth of color increases with increasing 
amounts of both reagents but that at high concentrations a 
white precipitate forms too rapidly. This does not take place 
nearly so rapidly with lower concentrations. That increased 
amounts of reagents give increased readings shows that the 
protein has not reacted as completely as is possible.
The effect of time of exposure to sodium hydroxide before, 
during, and after heating is shown in Table II. The protein 
solution can stand with the sodium hydroxide at least 4 hours 
before heating or 5 hours after heating without changing the 
final color value. The heating may continue from 3 to 14 
minutes.
The concentration of sodium hydroxide during the 10- 
minute heating period is unimportant, since heating 5 ml. of 
protein solution with 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, or 2.5 ml. of sodium 
hydroxide solution, followed by the subsequent addition of 
the remainder of the sodium hydroxide solution after cooling, 
gives identical final color readings.
The color value should not be read for at least 10 minutes 
after the addition of the phenol reagent, as is shown in Table 
III. The reading is then constant until a white precipitatebegins to form. The time of formation of this precipitate is 
variable. It probably is a supersaturation phenomenon, 
since traces of the precipitate greatly increase the rate of 
precipitate formation.
The temperature at which the mixing takes place was varied 
(Table IV). Apparently the optimum temperature is room 
temperature, 20° to 25° C. The rate of addition of the 
phenol reagent is important, since adding the reagent with 
stirring in small portions over a period of 1  minute increased 
the color intensity by over 10 per cent. However, adding the 
reagent rapidly, all in one portion, followed by shaking im­
mediately or even 1  minute later gave constant results.
If the heating step is omitted, the optimum volume ratio 
of phenol reagent to sodium hydroxide solution remains the 
same and the rate of color formation is similar to that when the 
solution is heated, but the maximum color is 20 per cent less. 
The main difficulty incurred when the heating is omitted is

that the color reading depends on the time of exposure to 
sodium hydroxide for any relatively short time, as shown in 
Table V. This would require that subsequent steps in the 
analyses be delayed inconveniently for at least 2 hours, since 
in the author’s work the protein samples are precipitates 
which are often slowly soluble in alkali, and thus no standard 
short time could be chosen. Heating with alkali presumablydenatures the protein, so that all chromogenic groups are ex­
posed, and thus any slight dénaturation in the handling or 
aging of the protein (4) can be neglected.

Microdetermination of Volatile Matter  
in Coal and Coal Products
M A RT IN  N EU W O RT II AND W . R . K IR N E R  
Coal Research Laboratory, Carnegie Institute of Technology, Pittsburgh, Penna.
TH E need for microdetermination of volatile matter arose 
in this laboratory in connection with a study of the com­
bustion of pulverized coal (6). Volatile matter had to be de­
termined on small amounts of physically similar particles 
which had been separated by microscopic examination. 
Since only small amounts of products were available from the 
combustion studies, the standard A. S. T. M. (1) procedure 
for determining volatile matter was impractical.
The method decided upon consists, essentially, of carboni­
zation of a 3-mg. sample in a stream of dry, oxygen-free nitro­
gen. The sample is contained in a platinum microboat placed 
in a quartz combustion tube. Similar tube methods for 
macrodetermination of volatile matter have been described 
in the literature (2, 3, 4)-  This micromethod offers the ad­
vantages of introduction of the boat into a cold part of the 
tube, carbonization at a high heating rate, and cooling in an 
oxygen-free atmosphere. Oxidation of the sample is thereby 
minimized. No attempt has been made to obtain agreement 
with the standard A. S. T. M . method. Statistical analysis 
of the results obtained by the micromethod on 43 samples 
showed that this procedure gives results as reproducible as 
those obtained by the A. S. T. M . method. The statistical 
analysis was similar to one made on macro results for volatile 
matter (5). The limited data available indicate that there is a 
linear correlation between the standard differences of duplicate 
analyses and the absolute level of volatile matter. The re­
sults obtained by the micromethod are somewhat higher, 
owing to a higher rate of heating. Similar results have been 
observed previously (7).
Apparatus
The apparatus consisted of a quartz combustion microtube 
with a side arm. Nitrogen was freed of oxygen by passage 
through an electrically heated tube containing metallic copperand then passed in turn through a concentrated sulfuric acid 
wash bottle and a large U-tube filled with Anhydrone, which was 
connected to the side arm of the combustion tube. The sulfuric 
acid wash bottle served as a bubble counter. The combustion 
tube was heated electrically by a cylindrical furnace 22.5 cm. 
long and 11.5 cm. in diameter. The temperature gradient along 
the furnace was determined by means of a Chromel-Alumel ther­
mocouple. Readings were taken at 1.5-cm. intervals on both 
sides of the center of the furnace with the thermocouple inserted 
in the combustion tube, nitrogen flowing at 10 cc. per minute. 
The maximum temperature difference for a length of 6 cm. was 
5° C.
To permit introduction of the boat in a cold part of the tube, 
the furnace was mounted on a steel track. This permitted it to 
slide laterally along the length of the combustion tube and be re­
placed accurately at a given place around the tube.
The boat was placed in the tube and pushed to a fixed spot by 
means of a marked glass rod. This position was at the center of 
the furnace when the furnace was moved into position. To de­
termine the rate of heating of the sample as it was being carbon­
ized, “blank” runs were made with the thermocouple junction 
placed in the same position occupied by the boat in a determina­
tion with nitrogen flowing at the standard rate. The tempera­
ture reached 865 = * =  5° C. in one minute and 950 ± 5 0  C. between 
the sixth and the tenth minute. Temperature constancy was 
maintained by manual control using a Varitran voltage regulator.
M ethod
Three milligrams of finely ground sample were spread uni­
formly along the bottom of a platinum microboat, dried in a 
Pregl block at 115° C. for 15 minutes, and weighed on a micro­
balance. The boat was introduced into the combustion tube 
and pushed into position with a glass rod. Dry nitrogen was 
passed through the combustion tube for 15 minutes at 10 cc. per 
minute to displace the air. The furnace was then moved along 
the track to a fixed position so that the boat was now at. the cen­
ter position. At the end of 10 minutes, measured with a stop 
watch, the furnace was moved away from the boat. The boat 
was permitted to cool for 7 minutes, preliminary tests with a 
thermocouple having shown that the temperature dropped to

placed on a cooling block for 5 minutes and weighed. In cases 
of low volatile samples more accurate results were obtained by 
weighing the boat and residue in a glass-stoppered pig. The 
results on various samples are indicated in Table I.
Sum m ary
A micromethod has been described which has the same re­
producibility as the A. S. T. M . macroprocedure, but gives 
somewhat higher results. Carbonization, sample introduc­
tion, and sample removal occur under conditions which mini­
mize air oxidation. The method can be applied to samplesvarying over a wide range of volatile matter without modify­
ing the technique.

New Reactions of 2,2 -Diclilorodiethyl Sulfide
J. II. POLYA, O. A. M endelsohn & Co., M elbourne, Australia
TH E reaction of 2,2'-dichlorodiethyl sulfide with the 
chlorides of palladium, gold, and other heavy metals—es­
pecially with palladium chloride— has been used for the 
identification of this compound. Reactions with salts of 
copper are not very characteristic under ordinary circum­
stances, but they can be modified to yield sensitive, rapid, 
and simple methods for the identification of 2,2'-dichlorodi- 
ethyl sulfide.
A sheet of filter paper saturated with a 2 per cent solution of 
copper sulfate in water, or a saturated alcoholic solution of copper 
nitrate, containing 1  to 2 per cent of glycol or glycerol, is laid 
horizontally on a few layers of clean filter paper, and dried at 
room temperature. The reactions are more distinct if the 
copper nitrate solution is used. Finally, the test paper is cut to 
size and stored in an airtight container.
The test paper is not affected by pure glycol. Commercial 
glycol containing triethanolamine phosphate slowly produces 
a blue ring. Thiodiglycol, the parent compound of 2,2'- 
dichlorodiethyl sulfide, produces almost immediately a bright 
green spot with a very marked green border; 0.1 to 0.4 mg. 
of thiodiglycol can easily be detected in this way. The 
sensitivity of the reaction is greater if the thiodiglycol is 
applied free of solvent.
Hydrochloric acid produces a very pale yellow spot, easily 
distinguished from the dark brown spot caused by a mixture 
of hydrochloric acid and 2,2'-dichlorodiethyl sulfide; thecenter of the brown spot gradually changes to violet. Less 
than 0.2 mg. of 2,2'-dichlorodiethyl sulfide can be recognized 
by this reaction.
The direct reaction of 2,2'-dichlorodiethyl sulfide is not 
entirely satisfactory at lower concentrations, but the following 
indirect reaction is satisfactory in every respect.
The sample suspected of containing 2,2'-dichlorodiethyl sulfide 
is extracted with ether, and the ether solution is refluxed with 
normal alkali on a water bath kept at about 60° C. for 30 minutes. 
If the amount of 2,2'-dichlorodiethyl sulfide is known to be 
very small, a few minutes’ refluxing will suffice. A green color 
will appear on the test paper if more than 1  to 2 mg. of 2,2'-  
dichlorodiethyl sulfide is present.
To detect smaller quantities, the alkaline solution is acidified 
with dilute sulfuric acid in the presence of phenolphthalein, 
and the slightly acid solution is diluted with 5 volumes of alcohol. 
The precipitated sulfate is filtered and washed with absolute alco­
hol, and a few corns of anhydrous sodium carbonate are added to 
the filtrate to remove traces of acid. The test is positive if 
more than 0.1 to 0.2 mg. of 2,2'-dichlorodiethyl sulfide was 
originally present.
The test can be made still more sensitive by removing 
some or all of the solvent, but it is less sensitive than the 
sodium iodoplatinate test. Its practical advantage lies in 
the fact that the necessary reagents are easily procured and 
the test can be carried out in poorly equipped or emergency 
laboratories, or by A. R. P. workers who are not professional 
chemists.
The lamp can be attached to all makes and styles of bal­

entire working area of a balance to uniformly illuminate 
beam, chain scale, pointer index and pans. Objectionable 
shadows and poorly lighted areas are entirely eliminated.
The lamp is supported by a simple clamp and permits 
free movement of the sliding balance door. Bulk and 
weight of the reflector are greatly reduced by making a

ture your finished solution—furnish it ready-to-  
use?”  “Fine’’ said the customer, and that day a 
new product was added to the Baker &  Adamson 
line. It was Lead Fluoborate ... a concentrated, 
ready-to-use, sediment-free lead plating solution 
superior to any material that could possibly be 
made by ordinary “shop” methods!
This material is now available to all platers and 
interested users. It is successfully replacing Cad­
mium and Zinc in many applications. Further, due 
to the ease of plating with Lead Fluoborate, leadplating is finding a growing list of applications for 
which it is particularly suited ... such as airplane 
motor bearings, storage battery parts, etc.
THE POINT:  This is only one example of bow Baker
& Adamson is furnishing “special” chemicals to 
industry in finished, ready-to-use  form. If your 
industrial processes require such chemicals in 
commercial quantities, call a conference, and let 
us discuss your problem in terms of the end 
chemical required.
The Baker &  Adamson organization is regularly 
helping manufacturers with such problems and 
relieving them of unnecessary chemical manu­
facturing responsibility.  Our C O  years of experi­
ence in producing Reagent, U.S.P. and N.F. chemi­
cals is at your disposal! Write or phone us today 
for a conference. We will work with you directly 
throughout —and confidential  problems will be 
handled in the strictest confidence.

EXPLOSION PROOF MOTOR  
FOR HAZARDOUS LOCATIONS
To meet the demand of the O il Industry for a large centrifuge with an ex- 
losion proof motor, the International M odel A E  Centrifuge was developed. 
' e M odel A E , equal in size and capacity to the Size 2 Centrifuge, has aSill* . IT  iw u v i » » u . «.V|uai III Jii.». a iiw  v.u(jav.iijr iw » 1 1«  t- K . a.  lia s «
maximum speed of 1,700 r.p.m. which is sufficient for the testing of oils, 
However, the Chemical and Paint Industries require the higher speeds of th« 
new explosion proof motor which is now available.
In t e r n a t io n a l  Mo d el  be Centrifuge
with explosion proof motor of 3,450 r.p.m.
accommodates the regular centrifuge equipment and has the safety features 
of the M odel A E  with the added advantage of higher speed for more gen­
eral industrial uses. The special adjustable high speed motor is approved for 
Class 1— Group D locations.
A  speed regulator and disconnect switch are mounted permanently in a 
vaporproof box on the side of the centrifuge and connected through con­
duit and explosion proof fittings to the motor. The sealed ball bearings 
of the motor require no attention. A  conveniently located hand brake 
permits rapid stopping.

MANOSTAT,
CARTESIAN
We recommend this device as a most con­
venient, effective means for obtaining reduced 
pressure control in vacuum distillations, etc. 
This device presents a simple, positive means for 
setting and maintaining any desired vacuum in 
a system. It eliminates all electrical appliances 
and no additional accessories are required 
other than shown in illustration.
The functioning is explained by the fact 
that when the pressure is reduced to the de­
sired point in the manostat and system, equal 
pressure exists within the mercury-sealed bell 
chamber of the float and outside of it. The 
mercury therefore is at the same level.
As soon as stopcocks "A" and "B" are closed, 
it is obvious that any evacuation of the system 
can only be accomplished through the orifice 
"O" which is now just exactly in contact with 
the disc.
A leak (not exceeding the capacity of the 
pump) now causes increased pressure in the 
system and consequent mercury displacement 
downward outside the float and upward inside 
the float. The float then sinks, opening up the 
orifice and permits unrestricted exhaust which 
then restores equilibrium as the float rises and 
pushes the disc in contact with the orifice and 
throttles the effect of the pump as required.
With a properly assembled system, smooth 
accurate control is obtained with no visible 
fluctuations.

Second and Revised Edition

A. C. S. Monograph No. 35
The new revised edition of this outstandingly suc­
cessful monograph has been eagerly awaited by in­
dustry for many months. In general the basic 
outline of the first edition has been adhered to, but 
the latest and most authoritative developments 
have been included and are described in detail. As 
in the previous book the gases discussed are those 
which occur predominantly in industrial processes;  
and one of the most useful features of this volume 
is the extensive and accurate classification of these 
gases according to their actions; for example, irri­
tants, asphyxiants, volatile drugs, inorganic and 
organo-metallic gases.
As in the first edition there are several chapters 
dealing with the physiological mechanisms of 
respiration, which are fundamental to an under­
standing of the action of toxic gases. An entire 
new chapter on the construction and use of breath­
ing machines has been added, and the chapters on 
artificial respiration have been extensively revised.
