Some 80 percent of the hazardous waste sites in the United States have contaminated ground water.
Conventionally, the treatment of contaminated ground water has been done by extracting thecontaminated water, treating it above ground, and reinjecting or discharging the clean water (“pump-and-treat”). The extracted contaminants must be disposed of separately. It is becoming increasinglyapparent that pump-and-treat technologies require considerable investment (between $14-17 million)over a long time (30 years or longer), and may not actually clean up the source of the contamination.Current policies and law stress “permanent” remedies over containment. Consequently, there isconsiderable interest and effort being expended on alternative, innovative treatment technologies forcontaminated ground water. 
This report is one in a series that document recent pilot demonstrations and full-scale applications that
either treat soil and ground water in place or increase the solubility and mobility of contaminants toimprove their removal by other remediation technologies. It is hoped that this information will allowmore regular consideration of new, less costly, and more effective technologies to address theproblems associated with hazardous waste sites and petroleum contamination.

Purpose and Process
The purpose of this document is to describe completed and ongoing pilot demonstrations and full-scale
applications of in situ  chemical oxidation technologies for the remediation of soil and ground w ater at
waste disposal and spill sites.
Information for this report came from commercial and government databases, such as the Dialog
Information S ervices and the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Vendor Information S ystem forInnovative Treatment Technologies (V IS ITT). Additional materials w ere obtained from EPA RegionalOffices, Department of Energy staff at  the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Westinghouse S avannahRiver, Department of Defense site staff, and Battelle Laboratories. Personal interviews and discussions
with representatives of EPA and other federal agencies, state environmental quality offices, academic
research centers, hazardous waste remediation consulting firms, and tec hnology vendors provided
supplementary information.
Technology Needs
In situ  chemical oxidation is one of several innovative technologies that show  promise in destroying or
degrading an extensive variety of hazardous wastes in ground water, sediment, and soil. The oxidantsused are readily available, and treatment time is usually measured in months rather than years, making
the process economically feasible.
Enrichment w ith dissolved oxygen has been show n to stimulate in situ  biological processes, but also is
used at at least one site to oxidize arsenic. Potassium permanganate is a stable and easily handledoxidant in both solid and solution form. Hydrogen peroxide can be costly, and because of its volat ility
requires protective measures. Nevertheless, the shorter process may save on labor and operating costs.
In situ  chemical oxidation can be applied in conjunction w ith other treatments such as pump-and-treat
and soil vapor extraction to break dow n remaining compounds. It is less costly and disruptive then othertraditional soil treatments such as excavation and incineration. In situ  chemical oxidation may be used in
applications where the effectiveness of bioremediation is limited by the range of contaminants and/orclimate conditions.
Technology Description
In situ  chemical oxidation is based on the delivery of chemical oxidants to contaminated media in order
to either destroy the contaminants by converting them to innocuous compounds commonly found innature. The oxidants applied in this process are typically hydrogen peroxide (H O ), potassium
22
permanganate (KMnO ), ozone, or, to a lesser extent, dissolved oxygen (DO).4
The most common field applications thus far have been based on Fenton’s Reagent w hereby hydrogenperoxide is applied w ith an iron catalyst creating a hydroxyl free radical. This hydroxyl free radical is
capable of oxidizing complex organic compounds. Residual hydrogen peroxide decomposes into w ater
and oxygen in the subsurf ace and any remaining iron precipitates out. This process has a history of
application in waste treatment fields./G32The volume and chemical composition of individual treatments are based on the contaminant levels and
volume, subsurface characteristics, and pre-application laboratory test results. The methods for delivery
of the chemical may vary. The oxidant can be injected through a well or injector head directly into the
subsurface, mixed with a catalyst and injected, or combined with an extract from the site and theninjected and recirculated. In the case of hydrogen peroxide, stabilizers may be needed because of thecompound’s volatility.
In situ  chemical oxidat ion is being used for ground wat er, sediment , and soil remediat ion. It  can be
applied to a variety of soil types and sizes (silt and clay). It is used to treat volatile organic chemicals(VOCs) including dichloroethene (DCE), trichloroethene (TCE), tetrachloroethene (PCE), and benzene,toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) as well as semi-volatile organic chemicals (SVOCs)including pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).Hydrogen Peroxide (H O )22

E-mail: rslevin@qstmail.comFull-scale soil remediation using in situ  chemical oxidation for
the removal of dense non-aqueous phase liquids ( DNAPLs)
such as chlorinated solvents, and hydrocarbons, was begun in
1997 at Anniston Army Depot, Anniston, Alabama.
Site Background
The site consists of three industrial waste lagoons backf illed
with clay in 1978. It is approximately 2 acres with over 43,125yd  of contaminated soil containing up to 31% trichloroethene
3
(TCE), dichloroethene (DCE), methylene chloride, andbenzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX). TCEaccounts for approximately 85% of the 72,000 lbs of volatileorganic chemicals. The majority of contaminants were found atdepths of 8 ft and greater. The highest concentrations of TCEoccur at depths between 8 and 10 ft (maximum 20,100 mg/kg).
The water table fluctuates from 25-30 ft below the surf ace.
Technology Application
Three differently sized injector wells were installed to targetthree distinct depth intervals. Single shallow injectors screenedfrom 8-14 ft were installed in areas where contamination isshallower than 15 ft, single intermediate injectors were
installed where contamination was found from 15-20 ft, and
paired shallow and deep injectors screened from 20-26 ft wereinstalled in areas where contamination was found at both deepand shallow depths. In addition, 25 deep ground-water injectorwells were used for monitoring, and a vent flow balance systemwas installed to aid in maintaining an effective radial
dispersion of catalyst and H O . The Geo-Cleanse  patented
22®
injection process was employed to deliver H O  and trace22
quantities of ferrous sulfate and acid (to control pH) into the
contaminated soil. Chemical oxidation of the soil took placeover a 120-day period during which 109,000 gallons of 50%H O  were injected through a total of 255 injectors. Post-
22
treatment sampling began while the full-scale treatment wasstill in progress. In cases where contaminant concentrationsremained above Soil Screening Levels (SSLs), the location wasre-treated for polishing treatment.
The total cost to complete this project is estimated to be $5.7M.
Project completion originally anticipated for the end of fiscal
year 1998 is now contingent upon funding a final $500K and4final sampling. Funding for this project was made available in
increments. Therefore, the actual expenditures breakdown by
cost categories are not  available. Project managers estimate
that approximately two-thirds of the funds have been allocatedfor capital costs including chemicals and the injection processand one-third for monitoring and support. Oversight by theArmy Corps of Engineers is not included in this funding.
Results
This full-scale treatment was initiated in July 1997. For thoseareas where sampling and polishing has been completed,results indicate that this process was effective in reducingcontaminant concentrations in clays to below SSLs. Soilconcentrations of up to 1,760 mg/kg of TCE have been reduced
to below detection. Additional polishing treatment may st ill be
warranted depending upon the results of final sampling in theremaining blocks. As noted above, additional funding has beenrequested to complete this process. Operating data indicate noadverse migration of organics to surrounding soils or groundwater.

Technology Application
The pilot program involved three treatment cycles, with 4 daysper cycle. Each cycle involved injection of hydrogen peroxideand chelated iron through each of eight injection points. Full-
scale remediation was ordered based on the results of this pilotapplication. The final application involved one six-day cycle
using 14 injection points and 7 injection trenches.
The total cost of this demonstration, including pilot and full-
scale programs, was approximately $200K. This included thecost of materials, injections, and sampling. The monitoringwells were pre-existing.
Results
The pilot program began in August 1996, and analyses of post-treatment samples from the full-scale operation were completedin March 1997. BTEX was not detected in the post-treatmentsamples from nine of the monitoring wells. The total BTEXconcentration in the remaining four wells was 89 μg/L. As a
result, the state issued an unrestricted “no further action letter”
for the site. Based on this action, the property was sold.

A pilot application was performed using one injection point in
the area of highest contamination and one injection point 18 ft
away. A single treatment of reagent was completed over a 3-day period. Injections were performed in cycles with catalystsfollowed by the oxidizer. A site engineered injection apparatuswas used to control the flow of hydrogen peroxide (H O ) and
22
the proprietary ISOTEC /G4B catalyst (iron complex) into the
capillary fringe of the vadose zone. Based on the results of this
pilot, full-scale remediation was ordered. Six injection pointswere installed and three treatment cycles were performed overseveral days within a 3-month period.
The total cost of this demonstration, including pilot and full-
scale programs, was approximately $220K. This included
chemicals, injections, and sampling. Pre-existing monitoringwells were used for sampling, so installation costs are notincluded.
Results
The field pilot program began in December 1995, and analyses
of post-treatment samples from the full-scale operation were
completed in October 1996. Post-treatment samples taken  4months after the final treatment application indicated that mostof the contaminants, including MTBE,  were below detectionlimits. Total BTEX concentrations were less than 25 μg/L in
the same well that had registered in excess of 25,000 μg/L in
pre-test samples. As a result, the case was closed in November
1996.

(CleanOX  for the remediation of 1,1-dichloroethene (DCE),®)
1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCA), and vinyl chloride (VC) in groundwater was performed at a former news publisher fac ility in
Framingham, Massachusetts, in 1996.
Site Background
A dry well discovered during a site assessment containedchlorinated solvents and petroleum hydrocarbons from disposalof ink and degreaser wastes. The site includes a plant, which isapproximately 100 x 100 ft, and adj acent land of approximately
the same dimensions. The area of cleanup consisted of crushed
stone and soil surrounding the former dry well. Soil
surrounding the dry well was a fine-grained silty sand. Depth toground water averages approximately 2½ ft below groundsurface. The contaminant plume is approximately 80 x 80 ft.Prior to CleanOX  treatment, remedial actions at the site
®
included disposal of over 6,000 gallons of hazardous liquids
and fifteen 55-gallon drums of hazardous sludge. Pre-treatment
concentrations of TCA in the two monitoring wells weremeasured at 40,600 and 4,800 μg/L, and VC concentrations
were 440 and 110 μg/L.
Technology Application
The pilot-scale application was conducted to evaluate site-specific geochemistry. Two CleanOX  application points were
®
used over a 3-day period for treatment within the 30 ft diameterdry well area. The application involved a solution of H O , an
22
iron catalyst, and an acid to control pH. Two 4-in diameterPVC wells and five surrounding monitoring wells weresampled prior to application and resampled 3 weeks after
treatment.
The total cost of this application was $45K. This included the
chemicals, the application, and the expertise required to applyand report on the treatment. It did not include the cost ofmonitoring wells.
Results
Samples collected 3 weeks after the treatment indicated thatTCA at the two contaminated wells dropped from 40,600 to440 μg/L and from 4,800 to 2,300 μg/L. Concentrations of VC
dropped to levels ranging from below detection to 85 μg/L in
nearby wells.8The reduction of chlorinated hydrocarbon contaminants
achieved with the CleanOX application, coupled with the®
quantity of source contaminants removed during the originalremediation tasks, allowed the site owner to successfully closethe site with state approval without additional treatment. Nospecific restrictions on the use of the site were necessary, andthe site remains closed.

chemical oxidation (CleanOX ) for the remediation of®
trichloroethane (TCA) and other volatile organic compounds
(VOCs) in ground water were performed at an active industrialfacility in Clift on, New Jersey, from 1995-1996.
Site Background
Releases from an underground storage tank resulted in aground-water plume. An existing ground-water pump-and-treatsystem was located outside the building and had operated forfive years prior to this application with moderate reduction incontaminant concentrations. The high level of iron-metaboli-zing bacteria at the site caused frequent operations and main-
tenance problems for the pump-and-treat system. The aquifer is
heterogeneous and highly stratified. Site soils are low inpermeability (a bout 1 millidarcy) and c onductivity (about 10
-5
cm/sec), and the ground water has high organic carbon concen-
trations. Depth to ground water is approximately 16 ft. Pre-treatment sampling indicated average total VOC concentrationsat 44 mg/L. Maximum TCA concentration was  measured at
101 mg/L in one monitoring well.
Technology Application
The pilot-scale application, using 
HO, an iron catalyst, and an22
acid for pH balance, was performed at an existing well. Thechemicals were applied over a 3-week period. The full-scale
application involved the installation of an additional eleven 4-
in diameter PVC wells into the fractured bedrock underneaththe facility building. The application wells were screened 10 -30 ft below ground surf ace. Samples were taken following this
application and repeated a couple of months later.
The cost of the pilot and full-scale applications was approxi-9mately $235K. This included dr illing the wells, applying
chemicals, sampling, testing, and engineering oversight.
Results
Average total VOC concentrations dropped from the original44 mg/L to 15 mg/L. The post-treatment average level isassumed to be skewed since the project uncovered the fracturesystem containing most of the contaminant.  Results of this
application indicated a 98% reduction in TCA concentrations
in the most contaminated well, from 101 mg/L to 2 mg/L.Another full-scale application probably would be required toachieve MCLs for drinking water. The water standard requiredfor industrial application is 1 mg/L.

dense non-aqueous phase liquids ( DNAPLs)—primarily
tetrachloroethylene (PCE) and trichloroethene (TCE)—wasconducted in 1997 at the Savannah River Site in Aiken, SouthCarolina.
Site Background
The site selected for this demonstration was a 50 x 50 ft areaadjacent to a seepage basin. The treatment zone consisted of 64,000 ft  of soil containing approximately 600 lbs of DNAPL.
3
The soils consist of sand and clayey sands. DNAPL is present
at approximately 140 ft below ground surf ace and a bout 20 ft
below the top of the water table. The average ground-watercontaminant concentrations in the treatment area were
approximately 119 mg/L PCE and 21 mg/L TCE. The soil
contained PCE concentrations of 10-150 μg/kg. The highest
concentrations were found at approximately 140 ft belowground surf ace. This area of the Savannah River site was once
a fuel and target fabrication facility where uranium, lithium,aluminum, and other materials were processed into fuel
elements and targets for use in the nuclear production r eactors.
Technology Application
Four injector wells, three monitoring wells, and three vadosezone lysimeters were installed. Holes were drilled to depths ofapproximately 155 ft, and samples were collected at various
levels to determine the soil concentration of TCE and PCE in10soil. The treatment zone was approximately 30 ft deep. The
Geo-Cleanse  patented injection process was then employed to®
inject H O  and a catalyst (ferrous sulfate) over a 6-day period22
in a circular area with a radius of 27 ft. Injection was conductedin batch mode with one batch injected per day. The volume ofthe injection varied from 500-1000 gallons per batch. Threedays after the last injection, post-test dr illing was initiated to
verify destruction of DNAPL. In additi on, post-test sampling of
monitoring wells was conducted weekly for a 3-month period.
The total cost of the demonstration was approximately $511K.
This included approximately $60K for site preparation, $151Kfor pre-test dr illing and characterizati on, $184K for a tech-
nology test, $49K for post-test dr illing and characterization,
$7K for demob ilizati on, and $60K for documentation and 
project management.
Results
The demonstration, from pre-test characterization of the sitethrough post-test activities, took pl ace between January and
July 1997. A comparison of pre- and post-test soil borings
indicated a 94% destruction of DNAPL in the treatment zone.
The estimated pre-test DNAPL mass was 593 lbs, and the
estimated post-test mass was 36 lbs. Total destruction was notachieved and can be attributed to the process not contacting allDNAPL gl obules in the fine-grained sediments. Average
contaminant concentrations in the ground water were reduced
to 0.65 mg/L PCE and 0.07 mg/L TCE at the completion of
treatment.
Follow-up work was conducted in the summer of 1998 to
determine the effects of the chemical reactions on thegeochemistry and microbiology of the test zone and
surrounding areas.

1.5% concentrated solution of potassium permanganate
(KMnO ) to promote in situ  chemical oxidation of
4
trichloroethene (TCE) in low-permeab ility lenses of silt with
clay in the vadose zone. Testing was done at two sites.
Site Background
The presence of TCE is assumed to have resulted from either aleak or an explosion at the facility, which had been usedextensively for refrigeration and ice coring. Residual TCEcontamination has been identified in unsaturated soils 15-35 ftbelow the surface. Site soil consists largely of fine sands withsome silts, interbedded with veneer-thin stringers of sand and
thicker layers of nearly saturated silts and clays. The depth to
ground water is approximately 130 ft. Two locations at the sitewere selected for the pilot tests, representing moderate(approximately 170 mg/kg) and high (maximum 60,000 mg/kg) levels of TCE contamination.
Technology Application
Following pre-test sampling and analysis, a 1.5% KMnO
4
solution (15 g/L) was injected to the subsurf ace via two direct-
push wells, one a ¾-in diameter piezometer and the other a 2-instainless steel screened well, to enable injection at discretedepths from 19.7 to 21 ft. Three samplers were pl aced near the
injection well to collect pore water samples during the
treatment process. Approximately 200 gallons of KMnO
4
solution was injected in several batches at Site 1 over a 53-day
period, while 358 gallons were delivered to Site 2 over a 21-day period.
The cost of this particular pilot has not been itemized. It is part
of an overall remediation demonstration program at the site,
which is budgeted at $790K for fiscal year 1998.
Results
Pre-treatment sampling began in November 1997, with actualoxidant injection beginning in early 1998. Pre and post-
injection monitoring of pore water showed increases of
chloride concentrations from 20 to 6,420 mg/L, indicating that13TCE was being oxidized. Analyses of post-injection soil
samples also indicated cleanup may have been occurring, but
confirmation required additional treatment and sample
collection since the samples collected were too small to havebeen statistically significant. It was determined thatsignificantly larger volumes of KMnO  solution or higher
4
concentrations of the oxidant would be required to achievecomplete cleanup. A second pilot took pl ace in the spring 1998
with a larger volume of the oxidant (1,200 gal/week), and post-
treatment samples were collected in June. Preliminary resultsof these samples indicate the need to inject the oxidant underpressure using smaller boreholes to better contain the oxidant.Actual data are not yet available. CRREL anticipates havingtwo additional larger-scale demonstrations up and running in
the fall of 1998. These sites w ill involve the use of boreholes
with packers to inject the KMnO  under pressure.

KMnO4A field demonstration of in situ  chemical oxidation using
potassium permanganate (KMnO ) to treat dense non-aqueous4

tetrachloroethene (PCE)—was conducted at the CanadianForces Base Borden in Ontario, Canada, from 1996-1997. Itfollows two similar but smaller field demonstrations on thebase in the early 1990s.
Site Background
The approximately 50 x 50 meter (164 x 164 ft) site is in a 4-meter (13-ft) thick sand aquifer. The sand is highlyhomogeneous and has hydraulic conductivity of approximately86 cm/day. The s ource zone is located 1 m (3.3 ft) below the
water table. Typical ground-water velocities at the site are on14Soil Type:

1996, it was estimated that the source zone contained an
average of 1,200 mg/kg TCE and 6,700 mg/kg PCE.
Technology Application
This demonstration used a series of six injection and fiveoxidant recovery wells. While previous experiments wereconducted in sheetpile containment wells, the only form of
hydraulic control on the injected oxidant in this demonstration
were the wells. The reaction was monitored using a fence ofseven bundled mini-piezometers (98 sample points total)perpendicular to ground-water flow and 1 m (3.3 ft) downgrad-ient of the source zone. The DNAPL s ource zone was flushed
with a solution of approximately 8 g/L KMnO  for almost 500
4
days.
The total cost of the demonstration is approximately $45K. Results
The  oxidant flush was conducted between May 1996 andSeptember 1997. Pre liminary analyses indicate a 99%
reduction in peak concentrations for both PCE and TCE; final
sampling results are expected in late 1998. The mass flux(mg/day) dissolved contaminants seems to have reduced byfour or five orders of magnitude. Further work to confirm thesepreliminary results, including an estimate of solvent masscurrently in the source zone, is continuing.

E-mail: jbaker@kcp.comAn in situ  chemical oxidation field demonstration using
potassium permanganate (KMnO ) for the remediation of4
chlorinated solvents was conducted in 1996 at the U.S.Department of Energy (DOE) Kansas City Plant in KansasCity, Missouri. It was part of a larger study in which threetechnologies—bioaugmentation, chemical oxidation, and
mixed-region vapor stripping with calcium oxide—were
combined with deep soil mixing.
Site Background
The test site occupied approximately 60 x 140 ft in stiff claysoils just north of a former lagoon. Depth to ground water is
approximately 8-10 ft below ground surf ace. G round-water
samples indicated high concentrations of trichloroethene(TCE), 1,2-dichloroethene (DCE) (over 15,000 μg/L) and
chloroethene (over 1,500 μg/L). Previous soil investigations
indicated elevated levels of total petroleum hydrocarbons(TPH) ranging up to 6,961 mg/kg, polychlorinated biphenyls
(PCBs) as high as 9.8 mg/kg, and concentrations of TCE and
1,2-DCE in soil below the water table as high as 81 mg/kg and15 mg/kg, respectively. 
Technology Application
The field demonstration, testing, and evaluation activities
involved a crane-mounted vertical rotating blade system
designed to mix the soil using 8-10 ft diameter blades. Duringthe in situ  mixing process, treatment agents were injected
through a vertical, hollow shaft into the soil. Fifteen soilcolumns, 8 ft in diameter, grouped three to a treatment cell,were treated to depths of approximately 25 to 47 ft. A shallow(25 ft) and a deep (47 ft) cell were used for in situ  mixing with
a 4-5% KmnO  solution. The cells were treated separately over
4
two 2-day periods in three overlapping test columns. Although
soil mixing redistributed the media making it impossible forpost-treatment sampling to replicate pre-treatment sampling,post-treatment samples were collected in similar fashions andlocations as pre-treatment samples.
The total cost of the demonstration was approximately $1M.
This included all pre- and post-testing, permitting, equipment,and labor. Actual cost breakdowns are not available. On a pro-rated basis, the costs by technology are estimated to be $128/yd  for KMnO  compared to $77/yd  for bio-augmentation and
3     3
4
$62/yd  for vapor stripping.316Results
This demonstration was conducted in July 1996. The goal of
the project was to achieve a 70% removal rate of contaminants.
Comparing pre- and post-treatment TCE mass values at the twocells treated with KMnO , one cell indicated an overall removal
4
of 83% of TCE from the unsaturated soil and the other areduction of 69% from the saturated soil. This compares to a65% reduction in the unsaturated soil treated by vapor
stripping, and a 38% reduction for that treated with bioaugmen-
tation. The results also show that the physical and biologicalproperties of the soil treated with KMnO  remain essentially
4
intact. Additional sampling was performed in Spring 1998 andanalysis is underway.

through recirculation (ISCOR) to remediate soil and groundwater for chlorinated solvents, primarily trichloroethene (TCE),was conducted at the X-701B site of the Portsmouth GaseousDiffusion Plant in Piketon, Ohio, in 1997.
Site Background
The site was 200 x 90 ft, with four distinct underlying strata:silt and clay (25-30 ft thick), a sand and gravel (2-10 ft thick),shale (10-15 ft thick), and sandstone (47 ft deep). The field testwas targeted at treating contamination in the relativelypermeable sand and gravel layer, since it has the highest risk
for off-site migration. This layer is 5-6 ft thick and
approximately 30 ft below ground surf ace. The layer is
contaminated primarily with TCE. Ground water is 12-14 ftbelow the surface. Pre-treatment testing of soil samplesdetected an average TCE concentration of 54 mg/kg with amaximum concentration of 302 mg/kg. Ground-water samples
revealed concentrations up to 800 mg/L.17Points of Contact:

This demonstration used a pair of previously installed parallel
horizontal wells, 90 ft apart with 200-ft screened sections
consisting of 5-inch diameter, high-density polyethylene porousfilters. Water for the oxidant injection solution was extractedfrom the upgradient horizontal well, mixed with crysta lline
potassium permanganate (KMnO ) in concentrations of 1.5-
4
2.5%, and re-injected into the downgradient horizontal well.
Twenty-two boreholes were dr illed between the wells and
samples were taken at 1-ft intervals from 20-30 ft belowground surf ace. Three -quarter-inch-diameter PVC wells with 5-
ft screens were installed in 14 of the boreholes. 
The total cost of the demonstration was $562K. Approximately
$56K was allocated for project planning and management,
$163K for pre-treatment sampling and mob ilizati on, $163K for
operations and maintenance, $101K for post-treatmentsampling, $68K for resistivity monitoring, and $11K forsupport. 
Results
This field test was conducted from July-August 1997, and post-treatment characterization was completed in August 1997.Post-treatment characterization showed that ISCOR waseffective at reducing TCE in both soil and ground water to non-detectable levels in those areas where the oxidant was able tomigrate. Lateral and vertical heterogeneities within the
treatment zone impacted the uniform delivery of the oxidant.
Monitoring of the ground water in the area was conducted
between October 1997 and June 1998 and analysis continues todate. New field testing at a different location on this facilityusing sodium permanganate and vertical injection and
extraction wells is expected to begin in the summer of 1998.
Sodium permanganate was selected because of its considerablyhigher solubility in aqueous solutions than KM nO . Its higher
4
solubility allows for the use of alternate modes of delivery such
as liquid chemical feed.

(C-Sparge™) system and a vacuum extraction system toremediate soil and ground water contaminated with petroleum
hydrocarbons and benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene
(BTEX) was administered at a former service station site inCommerce City, Colorado, in 1997.
Site Background
The site, which once served as a bulk storage and service
station facility, is part of a metal recycling facility. Subs urface
material consists of sand and gravel mixtures to approximately43 ft below ground surf ace, grading to a blue clay. G round
water is approximately 28 ft below ground surf ace. A soil and
ground-water investigation indicated that total petroleumhydrocarbons (TPH) in the soil ranged from 90-2,380 mg/kg.
Total BTEX in soil ranged from 7,800-36,550 μg/kg. TPH in
the ground water ranged from free product to 490 mg/L andBTEX ranged from 22-2,260 μg/L. Concentrations of benzene,
the contaminant by which the cleanup standard was measured,ranged from below detection limits to 16 μg/L.
Technology Application
The C-Sparge™ process consists of a combination of in situ  air
stripping with encapsulated ozone to oxidize contaminants.Two master panels, each controlling three wells, were installed.Each well consists of an in-ground sparge point that injectspulsating ozone and air into the ground water, an in-well spargepoint that injects pulsating water in the well casing under
pressure, a water-circulation pump, and a packer. The
pressurized system allows the fine bubbles that transport theencapsulated ozone to infuse the formation without fracturingit. Each well was drilled 50 ft deep, and sealed from 10 ft
below grade to the ground surf ace. Sparge-point pressures
ranged from 14-20 psi, depending on the distance from the well
to the surface equipment. The system was augmented with a
large blower pulling 160 ft³ /min at 48-inch-vacuum water
column. The entire system ran through 12 complete cycles perday. Each cycle involved all six wells going through theapproximately 25 minute/well process of blowing ozone and airinto the ground water, blowing water into the casing, and
pumping. The blower operated continuously.20The anticipated cost of the demonstration from site investiga-
tion through final monitoring is approximately $160K. Of this,
$20K was allocated for site investigation, $55K for equipment,
$35K for installation, and $15K for sparge wells.  
Results
The system started in August 1997. The ground-water wells atthe site are monitored quarterly. The March 1998 results
showed dissolved TPH at 37 mg/L in the well that contained
free product during previous monitoring. No TPH or BTEXwas detected in any other monitoring wells, so the remediationsystem was turned off. Monitoring results in June 1998indicated levels remaining below the state maximumcontaminant levels for drinking water. The state did not require
confirmatory soil sampling. Samples w ill need to be taken for
four consecutive quarters following the shutdown of the systemin March 1998.

designed to compare and evaluate the cost-effectiveness of
three remediation technologies. It involved three s imilar

All three test sites were located near former and existing dry-cleaning facilities within the city limits. Sediments underlying
the sites consist of unconsolidated stream and terrace deposits(sand, silt, and clay). The water table is from 14 to 16 ft below
ground. Dissolved-phase PCE appeared limited to the top 15 ft

and below-grade piping, and ground-water monitoring wells.
The placement of monitoring wells varied for each site to
accommodate the tec hnology-specific data collection
requirements.
The ozone injection test involved a C-Sparge™ process which
combines air stripping with oxidation. The system included a
4-in diameter PVC remediation well installed to 35 ft below
grade with a micro-porous sparge point pl aced 33-35 ft below
grade. The wells were screened in the vadose and saturatedzones. A self-contained down-hole unit, containing a secondsparge point and fluid pump, was then installed in the well.Ground-water information was collected from a cluster of five
monitoring wells. The average rate of injection was 3 standard
cubic ft per minute. To better understand the effects of ozone, asecond identical configuration was installed to inject air onlythrough the sparge points. A cluster of three monitoring wellswas used to collect information from this test. 
The cost of this field demonstration for all three sites was
approximately $195K, of which $52K was for the C-Sparge™
test, $95K was for the NoVOCs™ test, and about $48K for theAAS/SVE test. A cost comparison indicated that the AAS/SVEsystem was the least expensive to install and the C-Sparge™the most economical to operate.
Results
Pilot test activities for all sites were conducted over a 5-monthperiod and included monitoring well and system installation,pre-test ground-water sampling, a 6-day system start-up period,on-going data collection and operation and maintenance, andpost-test ground-water sampling.
Monitoring wells 10 ft from the remediation well using ozone
indicate a 91% reduction in concentration of PCE, from 34 to 3μg/L. Air-only injections resulted in a 71% reduction, in-well
stripping an 87% reduction, and AAS/SVE a 66% reduction.

ozone is underway at a former industrial site in Sonoma,California to remediate the vadose zone and ground water forpentachlorophenol (PCP) and polycyclic aromatichydrocarbons (PAHs).
Site Background
This site (approximately 300 x 300 ft) was once the location fora wood treating fac ility, a cooling tower, and a water tank
manufacturer. These operations involved the use of PCP andcreosote. Contamination extends from shallow soils down tothe water table. The geology consists of semi-continuous layers
ranging from fine sands to clays, resulting in highly stratified
contamination. The application was designed to addresscontamination in all layers. Initial sampling of 10 locations onthe site indicated an average concentration of 1,800 mg/kg oftotal PAHs and 3,300 mg/kg of PCP.
Technology Application
This demonstration involves at least four multi-level ozoneinjections (for all the stratigraphic layers) ut ilizing a variety of
instrumentation including soil gas probes, piezometers,lysimeters, monitoring wells, thermocouples, and reflectometryinstruments to measure soil moisture content. Soil vapor
extraction wells were placed outside the treatment areas to
ensure that fugitive ozone emissions were minimized. Ozonewas injected through wells in the vadose zone at varying ratesup to 10 ft /min.
3
The inclusive cost of this field demonstration, once completed,is anticipated to be approximately $300K (half the cost was for
capital equipment and half for operations and maintenance).
Results
This field study was begun in the spring of 1998 and isanticipated to continue for an additional six months. After onemonth of continuous ozone injection, sampling from the 10
locations averaged 530 mg/kg PAHs and 570 mg/kg PCP.
Concentrations of PAHs were reduced 67 - 99.5% andconcentrations of  PCP were reduced 39 - 98%. Subsurfacegaseous ozone concentrations appear to be relatively uniform,decreasing with increasing distance from injection points. Soilgas data suggests that ozone utilization of greater than 90% is
achieved. The study calls for additional data to be acquired, soil23borings to be advanced after three and six months of treatment,
respirometry to be performed to determine the effects of
ozonation on microbial activity, and various engineering issues
to be investigated.

mateboer.kampen@wxs.nlA pilot test of micro-encapsulated ozone oxidation for
remediation of a deep plume of dissolved chlorinated solventsin ground water was conducted in Utrecht, The Netherlands, in1997. Micro-encapsulated ozone is empl aced in fine bubbles to
allow it to penetrate the subsurface.
Site Background
The field test took pl ace in a small park midway on a long
plume of chlorinated solvents, primarily trichloroethene (TCE),originating from a commercial building and extending over 800ft across a predominantly commercial and residential area. The
plume lies in a thick fine-sand deposit containing gravel lenses.
About one-half of the area of ground water overlying the TCEplume was contaminated with benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene,and xylene (BTEX) from a nearby fuel sp ill. Borings showed a
surface loam to 6 ft deep, g round water at 9 ft deep, fine sand
beginning at 19 ft deep, and clay from 124-130 ft deep. Initialsampling at four wells indicated concentrations of halogenated
volatile organic compounds (HVOCs) from 1,450-14,500 μg/L
and BTEX from 62-95 μg/L. The mean concentrations were
3,000 μg/L HVOCs and 60 μg/L BTEX.
Technology Application
The test involved a C-Sparge™ well consisting of an in-ground
sparge point, an in-well sparge point, a packer and a fluid
pump, four monitoring wells, of previously installed mini-wells, and a fire well. Mini-wells, commonly used in Europe, are small points installed using cone penetrometer rigs to helpdetermine the position of the plume and function as part of themonitoring system. The C-Sparge™ system consists of a

small bubbles, and the introduction of encapsulated ozone to
oxidize the contaminants. Water and fine bubbles were injected
from the lowest screen in the system (75 ft below grade), andreturn water entered the middle screen (42 ft below grade). Theuppermost screen (8 ft below grade) collected the gases fromjust above the water table to assure vapor control.
The cost of this field demonstration was approximately $35K.
This included placing the C-Sparge unit on site, a trailer tohouse the work area and monitoring equipment, a generatorsystem for the blower unit, dr illing, enclosing part of the site,
laboratory sampling, and report preparation. It did not includethe cost of installing the pre-existing wells.
Results
This field test ran for a 10-day period in April 1997. Its purposewas to determine the rates of contaminant removal. A kineticanalysis of the reaction rates was pe rformed. HVOC
concentration for the well with 14,500 μg/L fell to below 1,000
μg/L during the test period. Mean BTEX levels were reduced
from 54 to 17 μg/L in the central monitoring wells. Full-scale
treatment is expected to bring these concentrations to a levelbetween acceptable commercial and drinking water levels.Negotiations are currently underway to treat the entire plume.

Peterson/Puritan, Inc. Superfund Site in Cumberland, Rhode
Island, to reduce arsenic concentrations in ground water to less
than 50 μg/L.
Site Background
The site continues to support general and specialty chemicalmanufacturing industries. Historically, high organic-content
wastewater at the source area were disposed through subsurface
leachfields. The 1993 Record of Decision (ROD) specified thatpart of the remediation include the construction and installationof an in situ  chemical oxidation system comprised of an
infiltration gallery for delivering oxygenated water to theformer l eachfield locations and an above-ground oxidant
delivery system. Some wells in the remediation area indicated
concentrations of arsenic on the order of 1,000 μg/L. These
elevated levels of arsenic are, to a degree, the result ofreductive dissolution of the metal from native soil. The historyof the site indicates that arsenic has also been reported in thewastewater stream going to the leachfield. This oxidantdelivery system was constructed and became operational
following excavation and removal of leachfield soils from the
site.

A 35 x 65 ft infiltration gallery, a membrane-lined excavation,which holds the oxygenated water allowing it to percolate into
the subsurface, was installed within the former l eachfield at a
depth of 14 ft. Monitoring wells were installed within thegallery, and the leachfield excavation was backfilled. Elevenadditional micro-wells were installed around the site. Aprefabricated treatment building was constructed on site, andthe Oxidant Delivery System, composed of a degassing skid, an
oxygen dissolution skid, a degassing tank, and an oxygen
dissolution tank was assembled in the building. The systemwas designed to degas, superoxygenate, and inject municipalwater (at 8-9 gpm) into the aquifer. The goal of this applicationis to increase ground-water dissolved oxygen (DO) concentra-tions to a level greater than 0.5 mg/L causing the arsenic to
precipitate and rendering it immobile. It  is intended to reduce
the concentrations of dissolved arsenic and prevent its26Michael Resch or

return the geochemical balance of the site to its pre-l eachfield
state, which includes some level of arsenic because it occurs
naturally in the native soil.
The total capital cost of the remediation is estimated at $1.4M.
This includes $620K for design, $460K for gallery installationand system construction, and $320K for pilot startup. Annual
operations and maintenance costs, including sampling, utilities
and reporting are estimated to be $175K. Indirect costs, such asproject management and oversight, are included in thesefigures.
Results
The system was installed in 1996, a pilot test was performed inearly 1997, and full-scale operations began in April 1997. EPAis assessing the success of this technology on an ongoing basis.Data are being compiled for submission as part of the five-yearreview, which is due in the 4th quarter of the Year 2000. Nodata are currently available.
