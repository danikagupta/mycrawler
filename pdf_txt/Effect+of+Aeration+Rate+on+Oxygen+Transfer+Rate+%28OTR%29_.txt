Oxygen transfer rate
Bioreactors scale-upMicrobial processesGas–liquid interfaceIn aerobic bioprocesses, oxygen is a key substrate; due to its low solubility in broths (aqueous solutions), a
continuous supply is needed. The oxygen transfer rate (OTR) must be known, and if possible predicted toachieve an optimum design operation and scale-up of bioreactors. Many studies have been conducted to
enhance the ef ﬁciency of oxygen transfer. The dissolved oxygen concentration in a suspension of aerobic
microorganisms depends on the rate of oxygen transfer from the gas phase to the liquid, on the rate at which
oxygen is transported into the cells (where it is consumed), and on the oxygen uptake rate (OUR) by the
microorganism for growth, maintenance and production.
The gas –liquid mass transfer in a bioprocess is strongly in ﬂuenced by the hydrodynamic conditions in the
bioreactors. These conditions are known to be a function of energy dissipation that depends on the
operational conditions, the physicochemical properties of the culture, the geometrical parameters of the
bioreactor and also on the presence of oxygen consuming cells.Stirred tank and bubble column (of various types) bioreactors are widely used in a large variety ofbioprocesses (such as aerobic fermentation and biological wastewater treatments, among others). Stirred
tanks bioreactors provide high values of mass and heat transfer rates and excellent mixing. In these systems,
a high number of variables affect the mass transfer and mixing, but the most important among them arestirrer speed, type and number of stirrers and gas ﬂow rate used. In bubble columns and airlifts, the low-
shear environment compared to the stirred tanks has enabled successful cultivation of shear sensitive andﬁlamentous cells. Oxygen transfer is often the rate-limiting step in the aerobic bioprocess due to the low
solubility of oxygen in the medium. The correct measurement and/or prediction of the volumetric mass
transfer coef ﬁcient, (k
La), is a crucial step in the design, operation and scale-up of bioreactors.
The present work is aimed at the reviewing of the oxygen transfer rate (OTR) in bioprocesses to provide a
better knowledge about the selection, design, scale-up and development of bioreactors. First, the most usedmeasuring methods are revised; then the main empirical equations, including those using dimensionless
numbers, are considered. The possible increasing on OTR due to the oxygen consumption by the cells is taken
into account through the use of the biological enhancement factor. Theoretical predictions of both thevolumetric mass transfer coef ﬁcient and the enhancement factor that have been recently proposed are
described; ﬁnally, different criteria for bioreactor scale-up are considered in the light of the in ﬂuence of OTR
and OUR affecting the dissolved oxygen concentration in real bioprocess.

1. Introduction
Most industrial microbial processes are aerobic, and are mostly
carried out in aqueous medium containing salts and organic sub-
tances; usually these broths are viscous, showing a non-Newtonian
behavior. In these processes, oxygen is an important nutrient that
is used by microorganisms for growth, maintenance and metabo-
lite production, and scarcity of oxygen affects the process
performance ( Garcia-Ochoa et al., 2000a; Calik et al., 2004; Liu
et al., 2006a). Therefore, it is important to ensure an adequatedelivery of oxygen from a gas stream to the culture broth.
Consequently, accurate estimtion of the oxygen transfer rate
(OTR) at different scales and under different operational conditions
has a relevant role for the prediction of the metabolic pathway for
both growth and production of any wished metabolite in the
aerobic cultus it is of critical importance for the selection, design
and scale-up of bioreactors.
Extensive literature on the oxygen transfer rate in bioreactors is
nowadays available and a considerable part of it has been published in
the last years ( Arrua et al., 1990; Badino et al., 2001; Galaction et al.,
2004; Puthli et al., 2005; Clarke et al., 2006 ). Substantial results on
different aspects of oxygen transport have been reviewed in different
works ( Margaritis and Zajic, 1978; Kawase and Moo-Young, 1990;
Arjunwadkar et al., 1998; Gogate et al., 2000; Kilonzo and Margaritis,2004; Clarke and Correia, 2008 ).
The oxygen mass transfer rate can be described as proportional
to the concentration gradient, being the volumetric mass transfercoefﬁcient, k
La(Eq. (4)) the proportionality constant. The max-
imum value of the concentration gradient is limited due to the lowsolubility of most gases associated to aerobic fermentation, notably
oxygen. Therefore, the maximum mass transfer rate from the gas
to the liquid in the bioreactor can be estimated by the product
k
La·C⁎,b e i n g C⁎the saturation concentration in the liquid phase.
There are a great number of empirical equations to determine
kLa, and efforts have recently been made for theoretical prediction
ofkLavalues; most of these works having been developed for
bubble columns and airlifts ( Kawase et al., 1987; Garcia-Calvo,
1989; Kawase et al., 1992a,b; Garcia-Ca lvo, 1992; Tobajas et al.,
1999; Sanchez et al., 2000), and a lesser number dealing with thetransport in stirred tanks bioreactors ( Kawase and Moo-Young,
1988; Kawase et al.,1992a; Garcia-Ochoa and Gomez, 2004, 2005). Theseprediction methods successfully predict the transport coef ﬁcient
for bioreactors of different sizes and under different operationalconditions.
The bioprocesses are usually conducted under previously optimized
conditions (temperature, pH, pressure, mixing, concentrations of
biomass and nutrients), with an operational mode previously chosen
(batch, fed-batch, resting cell, continuous). The overall mass
transfer rate is not easy to measure, because different pheno-mena are simultaneously taking place; also the relative importance
of these phenomena changes with the scale, the type of bioreactor,
etc. Therefore, the OTR is in ﬂuenced by a high number of para-
meters (physical properties of gas and liquid, operational condi-tions, geometrical parameters of the bioreactor) and also by the
presence of biomass, that is, the consumption of oxygen by the
cells. Fig. 1 is a schematic view of the different factors affecting OTR
at different levels in a bioprocess; these factors will be discussed inthis review.
Bioprocesses involve simultaneous transport and biochemical
reactions of several chemical species. Sometimes, the transport ofsubstrates to cells occurs at a rate considerably higher than the rate of
the metabolic biochemical reactions; in this case, the overall rate of
substrate conversion is governed only by the kinetics of the
biochemical reactions. However, if mass transfer rate is lower than
reaction rate, transport rate can be the step controlling the overall
process rate and, moreover, the mass transfer rate may be in ﬂuenced by
the chemical rate of the bioprocess. When a species in gas phase isabsorbed into a liquid and reacts there, the concentration pro ﬁles of the
absorbed species change due to the chemical reaction and theabsorption rate may be enhanced ( Van Swaaij and Versteeg, 1992;
Benbelkacem and Debellefontaine, 2003 ). Oxygen absorption into
a fermentation broth can be considered as the absorption of a gas into a
liquid where it reacts, oxygen is consumed by the suspended micro-
organism, and therefore an enhancement of oxygen mass transfer
rate can take place ( Tsao, 1969; Merchuk, 1977; Ju and Sundararajan,
1992; Garcia-Ochoa and Gomez, 2005 ). The increase of the speci ﬁc
gas absorption rate per driving force unit and per interfacial area
unit, due to the presence of the dispersed phase (in this case the
microorganism), can be characterized by an enhancement factor, E.
The aim of this work is to examine the oxygen transfer in microbial
processes in different bioreactors (stirred tanks and bubble columns),taking into account the effects of changes in viscosity, addition of173154 F. Garcia-Ochoa, E. Gomez / Biotechnology Advances 27 (2009) 153 –176substances able to change the hydrodynamics (salts, sugars, surfac-
tants, anti-foam, etc.), together with other special aspects of bioreactors
such as oxygen consumption by the microorganism.
1.1. Oxygen transfer rate (OTR) description
During aerobic bioprocess, the oxygen is transferred from a rising
gas bubble into a liquid phase and ultimately to the site of oxidative
phosphorylation inside the cell, which can be considered as a solid
particle. The transport of oxygen from air bubbles to the cells can be
represented by a number of steps and resistances, as schematized in
Fig. 2 ; the liquid ﬁlm resistances around bubbles usually control the
overall transfer rate.
The simplest theory on gas –liquid mass transfer is the two ﬁlm
model ( Whitman,1923 ) and usually the gas –liquid mass transfer rate is
modeled according to this theory (see Fig. 3 ), describing the ﬂuxthrough each ﬁlm as the product of the driving force by the mass
transfer coef ﬁcient, according to:
J0=kG/C1pG−pi ðÞ =kL/C1Ci−CL ðÞ ð1Þ
being J0the molar ﬂux of oxygen (mol·m−2s−1) through the gas –liquid
interface; kGand kL, are the local mass transfer coef ﬁcients; pGis the
oxygen partial pressure in the gas bubble; and CL, the dissolved
oxygen concentration in the bulk liquid; index irefers to values at the
gas–liquid interface.
Since the interfacial concentrations are not directly measurable and
considering the overall mass transfer coef ﬁcient, it can be rewritten:
J0=KGpG−p⁎/C16/C17
=KLC⁎−CL/C16/C17
ð2Þ
where p⁎is the oxygen pressure in equilibrium with liquid phase;
C⁎is the oxygen saturation concentration in the bulk liquid in
Fig. 1. Relationship between OTR, volumetric mass transfer coef ﬁcient and hydrodynamic parameters in bioreactors at several levels.155 F. Garcia-Ochoa, E. Gomez / Biotechnology Advances 27 (2009) 153 –176equilibrium to the bulk gas phase, according to Henry's law (p ⁎=HC⁎);
KGand KLare the overall mass transfer coef ﬁcients.
Combining Eqs. (1) and (2), the following relationship is obtained:
1
KL=1
HkG+1
kLð3Þ
Taking into account that oxygen is only slightly soluble in water (H
is very large), it is commonly accepted that the greatest resistance for
mass transfer is on the liquid side of the interface and the gas phase
resistance can usually be neglected and thus the overall mass
transport coef ﬁcient is equal to the local coef ﬁcient: KL=kL.
The oxygen mass transfer rate per unit of reactor volume, NO2,i s
obtained multiplying the overall ﬂux by the gas –liquid interfacial area
per unit of liquid volume, a:
NO2=adJ0=kLa/C1C⁎−CL/C16/C17
ð4Þ
Due to the dif ﬁculty of measuring kLand aseparately, usually the
product kLais measured and this parameter –called volumetric mass
transfer coef ﬁcient –characterizes the transport from gas to liquid .The driving force is the gradient between the concentration of the
oxygen at the interface and that in the bulk liquid (averageconcentration). Factors affecting this gradient include the solubility
and metabolic activity. The gas solubility, C⁎, in electrolyte solutions is
usually smaller than the gas solubility in pure water ( “salting-out
effect ”). Gas solubility is mainly dependent on the temperature, the
pressure, concentration and type of salts present and the chemicalreactions ( Linek and Vacek, 1981a; Hermann et al., 1995; Weissenborn
and Pugh, 1996 ).
2. Experimental determination of the volumetric mass transfercoefﬁcient ( k
La)
The determination of kLain bioreactors is essential in order to
establish aeration ef ﬁciency and to quantify the effects of the
operating variables on the provision of dissolved oxygen. A numberof methods have been developed to determine the oxygen transfer
rate in bioreactors ( Van't Riet, 1979 ). Some of these methods are
applied to others compounds as well, but others are speci ﬁc for
oxygen transfer measurement. When selecting a method, several
factors must be taken into account ( Novak and Klekner, 1988 ):
i. the aeration and homogenization systems used,
ii. the bioreactor type and its mechanical design,
iii. the composition of the fermentation medium and
iv. the possible effect of the presence of microorganism.
The mass balance for the dissolved oxygen in the well-mixed liquid
phase can be established as:
dC
dt= OTR −OUR ð5Þ
where d C/dtis the accumulation oxygen rate in the liquid phase, OTR
represents the oxygen transfer rate from the gas to the liquid,
described according to Eq. (4), and OUR is the oxygen uptake rate by
the microorganisms; this last term can be expresed by the product
qO2·CX,being qO2the speci ﬁc oxygen uptake rate of the microorganism
employed and CXthe biomass concentration.
The most common methods applied to measuring the oxygen
transfer rate in a microbial bioprocess can be classi ﬁed depending on
Fig. 3. Schematic representation of the gas –liquid interface, concentrations and mass
transfer coef ﬁcients KL,kLand kGaccording to ﬁlm theory.
Fig. 2. Steps and resistances for oxygen transfer from gas bubble to cell. (i) transfer from the interior of the bubble and gas ﬁlm; (ii) movement across the gas –liquid interface;
(iii) diffusion through the relatively stagnant liquid ﬁlm surrounding the bubble; (iv) transport through the bulk liquid; (v) diffusion through the relatively stagnant liquid ﬁlm
surrounding the cells; (vi) movement across the liquid-cell interface; and (vii) transport through the cytoplasm to the site of biochemical reaction.156 F. Garcia-Ochoa, E. Gomez / Biotechnology Advances 27 (2009) 153 –176whether the measurement is realized in the absence of microorgan-
isms or with dead cells or in the presence of biomass that consumes
oxygen at the time of measurement.
2.1. Measuring methods of k La without biological consumption of oxygen
In the absence of biomass or with non-respiring cells, when
biochemical reactions do not take place, OUR=0. In this case, Eq. (5)
can be simpli ﬁed to:
dC
dt=kLa/C1C⁎−C/C16/C17
ð6Þ
Some measuring methods are based on Eq. (6) and different
techniques from measuring the dissolved oxygen concentration canbe used, herein divided into chemical and physical methods.
2.2. Chemical methods
Chemical methods were the ﬁrst to become widely accepted. In
general, however, these methods are not recommended for volu-
metric mass transfer coef ﬁcient determination in the case of sparged
bioreactors, due to the changes of physicochemical properties ofliquids, especially coalescence, produced by the addition of chemicals.
This method can give values higher than the real ones, because the
absorption rate may be enhanced by fast chemical reactions in the
liquid phase, if the experimental conditions are not kept within
certain limits.
2.3. Sodium sul ﬁte oxidation method
This method is based on the reaction of sodium sul ﬁte, a reducing
agent, with the dissolved oxygen to produce sulfate, in the presence of
a catalyst (usually a divalent cation of Cu
++or Co++)(Cooper et al.,
1944 ); the reaction can be expressed as:
2S O−2
4/C0O2/C02S O−2
3=0 ð7Þ
There is a concentration range of sodium sul ﬁte (from 0.04 to 1 N)
for which the reaction is so fast that oxygen concentration can be
assumed to be zero. The reaction rate is much faster than the oxygen
transfer rate; therefore, the rate of oxidation is controlled by the rate
of mass transfer, and measuring the overall rate, the mass transport
rate can be determined. The reaction rate is a complex function of the
catalyst concentration and the operational conditions that must be
controlled in order to obtain reproducible measurements (Linek and
Vacek, 1981b ).
The experimental procedure consists in ﬁrstﬁlling the bioreactor
with a 1 N sodium sul ﬁte solution containing at least 10−3Mo fC u2+
ion, turning on the air and starting the time when the air emergesfrom the sparger; allowing the oxidation reaction to continue for some
minutes; after that, stopping the air ﬂow, agitating, and taking
samples of known volumes at regular time intervals. Mixing eachsample with an excess of standard iodine reagent and ﬁnally titrating
with standard sodium tiosulfate solution (Na
2S2O3) to a starch
indicator end point. The reactions are:
SO−2
4þ2Hþþ2I−−SO−2
3−I2−H2O¼0 ð8Þ
S4O2−
6+2 I−−2S 2O2−
3−I2=0 ð9Þ
The amount of residual sul ﬁte can be also estimated indirectly by the
stoichiometry of the reaction (8) on basis of colorimetric determination
of the iodine concentration ( Yang and Wang, 1992 ).Once the sul ﬁte concentration is measured versus time, the rate of
sulﬁte consumption is determined and kLamay be calculated from:
−dCNa2SO3
dt=2kLaC⁎ð10Þ
As quoted above, this reaction is catalyzed by heavy metal ions,
usually Co++; the concentration of these ions must be kept carefully
within narrow boundaries (5·10−6M) in order to obtain an adequate
reaction rate, avoiding acceleration of oxygen uptake due to the
chemical reaction. Linek and Vacek (1981b) have reviewed the use of
the sul ﬁte oxidation method, as a model reaction of known kinetics,
and its capacity for accurately determining mass transfer character-
istics. The sodium sul ﬁte oxidation method is relatively easy to carry
out. This technique has been used in a large number of works (Dussap
et al., 1985; Ogut and Hatch, 1988; Thibault et al., 1990; Yasukawa
et al., 1991; Yang and Wang, 1992; Benadda et al., 1997; Garcia-Ochoa
and Gomez, 1998; Liu et al., 2006a ). However, this method has the
limitation that, because some of its physicochemical properties arevery different from those of fermentation broths, the hydrodynamics
of the solution is changed, mainly due to the in ﬂuence of those
properties on bubble size. These changes cause the k
Lavalues obtained
to be bigger than those obtained by other techniques, and non realistic
(Van't Riet, 1979; Garcia-Ochoa and Gomez, 1998 ).
2.4. Absorption of CO 2
This method was proposed by Danckwerts and Gillham (1966) . The
method consists in the absorption of carbon dioxide in an alkalinesolution. The reactions taking place are:
HCO
−
3−CO2−OH−=0 ð11Þ
HCO−
3+H+−CO2−H2O=0 ð12Þ
According to Danckwerts (1970) , the reaction expressed by Eq. (11)
is of second order kinetics:
r=k/C1CO2½/C138 /C1 OH−½/C138 ð13Þ
the constant rate (20 °C) takes a value of 5·103L·mol−1·s−1:
On the other hand, reaction (12) has a ﬁrst order kinetic equation:
rV=kV/C1CO2½/C138 ð14Þ
the constant rate (20 °C) takes a value of de 2·10−2s−1.
Therefore, in any solution in which the concentration of OH−is
higher than 10−4mol·L−1(pH N10), the rate of reaction (11) will have a
constant rate of pseudo- ﬁrst order of, at least, 0.5 s−1, twenty- ﬁve times
higher than the rate constant of Eq. (12). Therefore, it is possible to
assume that the reaction (12) is the controlling step determining the
absorption rate of carbon dioxide in basic solutions with pH N10.
In order to be able to apply this method it is necessary to work with
a reaction of ﬁrst order, whereas the reaction (12) is of second order.
However, for gases in which the partial pressure of CO 2is not high, the
reaction behaves like one of pseudo- ﬁrst order ( Sharma and
Danckwerts, 1970 ) and the mass transfer coef ﬁcient can be obtained
from:
−1
2dCCO2
dt=kLa/C1C⁎ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
k/C1CCO2q
ð15Þ
In principle, this method uses a reaction more easily controllable
than the previous method, the oxidation of sul ﬁte. Nevertheless, it has
disadvantages similar to the previous one, due to the need of using
high concentrations of the ion OH-that inhibits the coalescence of the
bubbles.157 F. Garcia-Ochoa, E. Gomez / Biotechnology Advances 27 (2009) 153 –176To quantify the gas liquid mass transfer of other compounds, such
as oxygen, the relationship between the volumetric mass transfer
coefﬁcients for two different compounds, according to ﬁlm theory, can
be employed:
kLajO2
kLajCO2=DO2
DCO2ð16Þ
2.5. Physical methods
The physical methods employ the response of oxygen probe to
concentration changes in the dispersed gas in the medium, undernon-stationary conditions. These methods are nowadays the most
commonly used for oxygen transfer estimation, as they are based on
the measurement of dissolved oxygen concentration in the liquid
during the absorption or desorption of oxygen in the solution (Dussap
et al., 1985; Baird et al., 1993; Nocentini et al., 1993; Merchuk et al.,
1994; Garcia-Ochoa and Gomez, 1998; Sanchez et al., 2000; Puthli
et al., 2005; Clarke et al., 2006; Zhan et al., 2006 ).
2.6. Dynamic method
The dynamic method is one of those based on the measurement of
dissolved oxygen concentration in the medium by absorption o
desorption of oxygen. After a step change in the concentration in the
inlet gas, the dynamic change in the dissolved oxygen concentration is
analyzed. In this method, Eq. (5) can again be used, being now OUR=0,
which integration results (between two different times):
lnC⁎−C2
C⁎−C1=−kLa/C1t2−t1 ðÞ ð17Þ
The dynamic technique of absorption consists of producing the
elimination of oxygen in the liquid phase, for example by means of
bubbling nitrogen or by the addition of sodium sul ﬁte, until the
oxygen concentration is equal to zero. Later, the liquid is put in contactagain with air, measuring the variation (increase) of the oxygenconcentration with time.
The dynamic technique desorption consists in supplying air until
the oxygen saturation concentration in the liquid is reached. Then,
nitrogen is introduced downwards into the vessel and the dissolved
oxygen concentration decrease is recorded as a function of time.
Under these conditions: t
1=0,C1=CLo, Eq. (17) can be expressed as:
lnCLo
CL/C18/C19
=kLa/C1t ð18Þ
On the other hand, when the oxygen has been desorbed of culture
(by supply of nitrogen, e.g.) and oxygen is again supplied, now C1=0at
t1=0, Eq. (17) can be expressed as:
ln1−CL
C⁎/C18/C19
=−kLa/C1t ð19Þ
Eqs. (18) and (19) describe the time course of dissolved oxygen
from the restart of aeration or when it is eliminated from the culture;in both cases, k
Lacan be determined from the slope of the ln f(CL)v s.
time graph (see Fig. 4 as an example).
This technique is interesting for studying the inﬂ uence of
operational conditions on the volumetric mass transfer coef ﬁcient,
and is widely employed in the literature ( Garcia-Ochoa and Gomez,
1998; Sanchez et al., 2000; Puthli et al., 2005; Djelal et al., 2006 ).
Nevertheless, it is necessary to take into account that the response
time of the electrode, τr, is a critical parameter for the determination
of accuracy values of oxygen concentration. This response can affectthe correct determination of the mass transfer coef ﬁcient if the timecharacteristic for the oxygen transport, 1/ k
La, is of the same order than
the response time of the electrode, de ﬁned as the time necessary to
reach 63% of the ﬁnal value measured when exposed to a step change
of concentration ( Van't Riet, 1979 ). The response time of the electrode
can be determined by transferring the oxygen electrode from a
solution with sodium sul ﬁte (whose oxygen concentration is zero) to
another dissolution saturated with air (100% of saturation). In the casewhen the electrode of oxygen has a high value of τ
rit would be
necessary to introduce a correction in the response model (Eq. (6)); agood approach is a ﬁrst order dynamic ( Weiland and Onken, 1981;
Godbole et al., 1984 ), according to:
dCme
dt=CL−Cme ðÞ
τrð20Þ
The combination of Eqs. (6) and (20) permits to obtain the value of
kLafrom the dissolved oxygen concentration measurements in case of
saturation, according to the following equation:
Cme=C⁎+C⁎−C0
1−τrkLa/C1τrkLaexp−t
τr/C18/C19
−exp−kLa/C1t ðÞ/C20/C21
ð21Þ
where Cmeis the oxygen concentration measured by the electrode and
C0is the oxygen concentration at the initial time of the aeration.
Assuming that the dynamic response of the electrode is of ﬁrst
order, characterized by a constant time, a simple criterion for the
suitable selection of the electrode, and despite this effect, would be:
τrb1/kLa(Van't Riet,1979; Johnson et al., 1990 ). These limitations have
been widely described in the literature ( Akita and Yoshida, 1973;
Popovic and Robinson, 1989; Merchuk et al., 1990 ). When only one
probe is used this method is dif ﬁcult, because it strongly depends on
the modelling of probe dynamics, on the position of the probe in the
reactor, and on the assumption over hydrodynamic conditions. These
effects can be more important in bubble columns (Gourich et al., 2008 ).
The characteristic time of commercial fast oxygen electrochemicalsensors, τ
r, ranges generally around 5 s. The dynamic of the elec-
trode can be neglected only if the time for the oxygen transfer process(1/k
La) is higher than 10 τr(≈50 s). When the probe response is not
fast enough, which is currently the case in bubble columns (where10 s b1/k
Lab100 s), oxygen concentration measurements correspond
to a second-order process due to the probe in ﬂuence. According to the
work of Merchuk et al. (1990) mass transfer data analysis for dynamic
kLadetermination can be simpli ﬁed by truncation of the ﬁrst part of the
electrode response curve and applying the ﬁrst-order approximation;
nevertheless, truncating more than 30% of the lower end data is notrecommended. These results are consistent with those obtained by
Gourich et al. (2008) for a modelling of mass transfer assuming a
perfectly mixed ﬂow with transient hydrodynamic effects.

where OUR is the oxygen uptake rate, Finand Foutthe molar ﬂow rates
measured at bioreactor inlet and outlet, and V the bioreactor volume.
At steady-state, the rate of oxygen transfer from the bubbles is
equal to the rate of oxygen consumption by the cells:
kLa/C1C⁎−CL/C16/C17
= OUR ð23Þ
Once the oxygen uptake rate is determined from the measurement
of oxygen in the exhaust gas and, at the same time, the dissolved
oxygen concentration is measured in the medium, kLacan be calcu-
lated according to:
kLa=Fin
O2−Fout
O2
V/C1C⁎−CL/C0/C1 ð24Þ
where CLis the oxygen concentration in the liquid phase and C⁎
is the equilibrium or saturation concentration of the oxygen in
the liquid under the temperature and pressure conditions in the
bioreactor.
This technique is based on measuring the oxygen concentration of
the air in ﬂow and air out ﬂow, accurate modelling of gas phase mixing
being required for the correct interpretation of the measurement ofthe oxygen transfer rate ( Van't Riet, 1979 ). Also, it is important to take
into account the fraction of the oxygen consumed because, if oxygenuptake rate is low, the variation of the oxygen concentration between
the inlet and the outlet of the gas stream is very small, and it becomes
necessary to use very sensitive measuring equipment. On the other
hand, if the size of the bioreactor is large, the variation in driving force
(C⁎−C
L) in the bioreactor can be signi ﬁcant. In this case, the loga-
rithmic average value between the inlet and outlet of the gas streamcan be a good approximation for the driving force.
3.2. Dynamic methods
The dynamic methods are based on the technique proposed by
Taguchi and Humphrey (1966) , measuring the respiratory activity
of microorganisms which are actively growing in the bioreactor. If
the gas supply to the bioreactor is turned off, the dissolved oxygen
concentration will decrease at a rate equal to oxygen consumption by
the respiration of microorganism ( Fig. 5 ). Under these conditions
Eq. (5) can be simpli ﬁed to:
dCL
dt=−qO2/C1CX ð25Þ
obtaining OUR from the slope of the plot of dissolved oxygen con-
centration (after stopping air ﬂow) vstime; biomass concentration
must be known (or measured) at this time.
When the aeration is turned on again, the dissolved oxygen
concentration increases until it reaches the steady oxygen concen-tration, and by using the estimated OUR value, k
Lacan be
determined from the measured pro ﬁle of dissolved oxygen concen-
tration, using Eq. (5) again. Under these conditions, for a given
biomass concentration, CX, and once qO2value is known, Eq. (5) can
be integrated, taking into account the time at which the aerationof the culture is restored ( t=t1∴C=CL, known), and the following
equation can be applied:
qO2/C1Cx/C1Δt+ΔCL=kLa/C1∫t2
t1C⁎−CL/C16/C17
/C1dt ð26Þ
Eq. (26) can be used to determine the volumetric oxygen mass
transfer several times during the production process, solving this
equation for each data set of experimental values of CLvs.time.This
method is simple, and can be applied during an actual fermentation,when the response time of the oxygen electrode is lower than the
characteristic time for the mass transfer processes, as commented
above ( Garcia-Ochoa et al., 2000a; Bandaiphet and Prasertsan, 2006;
Djelal et al., 2006 ). However, this method is not applicable to situations
in which OUR can not be determined correctly when the gas supply is
turned off, e.g., when the dissolved oxygen concentration is very low. In
this case a modi ﬁed dynamic method can be used ( Gomez et al., 2006 ).
The modi ﬁcation consists in using a step change of air to pure oxygen in
the inlet gas stream or vice versa . The evolution of dissolved oxygen
concentration in the transition between two pseudo-steady statesallows the OUR and k
Lacalculations. Oxygen concentration changes as
the result of both physical oxygen absorption (or desorption) andoxygen consumption by microbial culture.
Assuming that q
O2,CX,C⁎and kLaare constant during the mea-
surement time, Eq. (5) can be now expressed as:
dC
dt=c−kLa/C1C ð27Þ
where cis a constant given by:
c=kLa/C1C⁎−qO2/C1CX ð28Þ
The integration of Eq. (27) when oxygen is absorbed with the
boundary conditions:
t=0∴C⁎=C⁎0∴C=CLoand t=t1∴C=CL,yields the following
equation:

3.3. Other methods
Other techniques have been proposed for measuring the volu-
metric mass transfer coef ﬁcient, which improve some aspects of the
classical methods. Some of them are based on a chemical reaction, likehydrazine oxidation ( Onken et al., 1985 ), bio-oxidation of catechol
forming 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde catalyzed by the enzymecatechol-2,3-dioxygenase ( Ortiz-Ochoa et al., 2005 ), another uses the
change of pH by constant bubbling of carbon dioxide into a well-mixed reactor ( Hill, 2006 ). Other methods consist in the measurement
of the oxygen limited growth rate of a strictly aerobic microorganism(Duetz et al., 2000 ).
There are also techniques for mass transfer coef ﬁcient determina-
tion based on physical methods ( Mignone, 1990; Gauthier et al., 1991;
Linek et al., 1994; Carbajal and Tecante, 2004 ), or by absorption of
some compound such as the krypton method ( Pedersen et al., 1994 ),
which is based in the injection of Kr-85 (volatile radio-isotope thatemits beta and gamma radiation) into the medium and the mea-
surement of the radioactivity in the outlet gas stream.
3.4. Comparison of the k
La values obtained by different methods
As pointed out above, chemical methods have the limitation of the
changes in ﬂuid dynamics caused by the addition of chemicals. Among
physical methods, the dynamic method is by far the most commonly
used in the last decades to evaluate kLa, due to its simplicity and
relative accuracy. Both the absorption and desorption measurementsgive equal values of k
Launder identical hydrodynamics conditions
(Gomez, 1995; Sanchez et al., 2000 ) although, if the characteristic time
for oxygen electrode is of the same magnitude as the characteristic
time for the oxygen transfer process (1/ kLa), the dynamic response of
the electrode must be taken into account for determining correctvalues of k
La.
InFig. 7 , as an example, kLavalues obtained by different methods
as a function of stirrer speed in non-Newtonian solutions and 20 L
vessel are compared (V S=2·1 0−3m·s−1and µ a=8·1 0−3to 30·10−3Pa·s).
The kLavalues obtained by Ogut and Hatch (1988) , using the sul ﬁte
measurement method, are much higher than those usually obtained
for an electrolyte solution. The difference is greater for lower values ofstirrer speed. This is due in part to the strong ionic state of the sul ﬁte
solution and in part to the chemical reaction enhancement of transfer
rate ( Thibault et al.,1990 ). The difference between the results obtained
by other authors can be explained by the effect of certain distinctivefeatures in the reactor used (like D/T ratio, stirrer and sparger type, etc.)
on the k
Lavalues. In Table 1 a comparison of different methods for
volumetric mass transfer coef ﬁcient determination in bioprocesses is
shown.
4. Empirical correlation of kLavalues
In the literature, both dimensional and dimensionless equations for
the volumetric mass transfer coef ﬁcient as a function of different
variables have been proposed. However, there are considerable
problems concerning the accuracy of kLaestimation, and frequent
discrepancies between experimental data and those estimated from
these equations are found, mainly when kLafor real broths are
estimated from equations proposed for aqueous solutions. This can bedue to the strong in ﬂuence of the type and size of the bioreactor, the
different range of operational conditions, the system considered —
solutions or real broths, the in ﬂuence of physicochemical properties on
hydrodynamics due to high viscosity of the liquid, its rheologicalbehavior or even the measuring method used ( Gogate et al., 2000;
Garcia-Ochoa and Gomez, 1998 ).
The volumetric mass transfer coef ﬁcient increases signi ﬁcantly
when ion concentration in the solution is raised. The addition ofelectrolyte increases gas hold-up, due to its in ﬂuence on decreasing
bubble size and the non-coalescence effect at both low and highpressures ( Wilkinson et al., 1994; Gogate et al., 2000; Puthli et al.,
2005 ). According to Van't Riet (1979), k
Lafor ionic solutions are more
depending on P/V than those for pure water. The kLavalues decrease
with increasing liquid viscosity ( Garcia-Ochoa and Gomez, 1998;
Garcia-Ochoa et al., 2000a; Kilonzo and Margaritis, 2004 ) and increase
with temperature ( Hiraoka et al., 2001 ). The addition of surfactants or
antifoams, substances commonly added to culture medium, provokes a
high decrease of kLavalues, compared to those of pure water ( Kawase
et al., 1992a, Garcia-Ochoa and Gomez, 2005 ). This can be due to the
effect of surfactant molecules affecting the hydrodynamic parameters:
the average bubble size may increase due to induced bubble
coalescence which, in turn, will affect the gas hold-up, hence, the
mass transfer area ( Arjunwadkar et al., 1998 ). Other authors have
pointed out the barrier effect of these substances, due to a mono-layerof the surfactants formed at the interface, which can offer resistance to
crossing by the gas molecules ( Yagi and Yoshida, 1974; Van der Meer
et al.,1992; Vasconcelos et al., 2003; Dai et al., 2004; Linek et al., 2005 ).
Some of these works showed that the addition of active-surface
compounds induced a signi ﬁcant reduction on the mass transfer

Fig. 6. Evolution of oxygen concentration in the liquid-phase when the composition of
the gas stream is modi ﬁed changing from air to pure oxygen (absorption) or from pure
oxygen to air (desorption).160 F. Garcia-Ochoa, E. Gomez / Biotechnology Advances 27 (2009) 153 –176coefﬁcient, between 80 and 40% depending on the surface tension
value.
On the other hand, improvement of OTR by addition of hydro-
carbons has been reported by Dumon and Delmas (2003) andClarke
et al. (2006) ; these latter authors found that kLais enhanced with
increasing alkane concentration between 0 and 10%. For this variation
several possible causes have been suggested: the alkane spreads as a
thinﬁlm on the bubble and acts by decreasing the surface tension and
increasing the interfacial area; the drops act as rigid spheres therebyincreasing turbulence; the drops modify the medium so that it can
carry more oxygen; or maybe a reduction in gas bubble diameter is the
effect provoked.
Thus, in hydrocarbon-aqueous dispersions, the hydrocarbon
impacts markedly on k
La, but in widely differing manners depending
on the hydrocarbon type and concentration, the process conditionsand the geometric constraints under consideration. This gives rise to
three distinct k
Labehavioural trends with an increase in hydrocarbonconcentration: kLaincrease to a maximum, with subsequent decease;
kLaincrease to a maximum with no decrease and no increase in kLaor
kLadecrease ( Clarke and Correia, 2008 ).
4.1. Stirred tank bioreactors
In mechanical agitated bioreactors, the stirrer is the main gas-
dispersing tool and stirrer speed and design have both a pronounced
effect on mass transfer. Empirical correlations for the volumetric mass
transfer coefﬁ cient depend on several geometrical parameters,
although there is no agreement in the literature about how to takeinto account this in ﬂuence. Van't Riet (1979) proposed a correlation of
k
Lawith P/V, stating that there is no in ﬂuence of stirrer geometry and
the number of stirrers on mass transfer in non-viscous systems.
However, Zhu et al. (2001) were able to increase the mass-transfer rate
by 17% by changing the impeller, and Puthli et al. (2005) found that kLa
values are affected by the stirrer con ﬁguration.Table 1

stirrer speed, N, super ﬁcial gas velocity, VS, and liquid effective
viscosity, µa, obtaining equations such as the following:
kLa=C/C1Va
s/C1P=VðÞb/C1μc
a ð31Þ
where the constant C depends on the geometrical parameters of the
vessel and the stirrer employed. Other equations proposed substitute
the average power input per volume, P/V, by the effect of stirrer speed,
N.Table 2 gives the values of the exponents of different correlations
available in the literature. It can be seen that the exponent values
(a, b and c) show a wide variation range in the different correlations
proposed by different authors: 0.3 ≤a≤0.7; 0.4 ≤b≤1;−0.4≤c≤−0.7.
For non-viscous systems the most frequently used correlation is thatfrom Van't Riet (1979).
Another approach is to use equations with dimensionless groups.
k
Lais included in Sherwood ( kLaT2/DL) o Stanton ( kLaV/Q) numbers,
expressed as a function of different dimensionless numbers suchas Reynolds ( ρNT
2/μa), Schmidt ( μa/ρDL), Weber ( ρN2T3/σ), Aeration
(NT/VS), Froude ( N2T/g), geometrical parameters of the bioreactor and
rheological properties of the ﬂuid. Table 3 and 4 show some of the
dimensionless correlations available in the literature for Newtonianand non-Newtonian ﬂuids. These can be divided into those which
reﬂect the effect of the stirrer speed directly ( N) and those which take
into account the power input ( P). The correlation of Nishikawa et al.
(1981) is the only one to include both variables. Yagi and Yoshida
(1975) used various liquids and gases to deduce the equations pro-
posed, although no effect of gas viscosity, as implied in the equation of
Perez and Sandall (1974) , could be observed. In addition, these authors
take into account the effect of viscoelasticity in the form of the Deborahnumber ( λN), but the method for evaluation of characteristic material
time ( λ) from the shear rate depending on the apparent viscosity can
be applied only to liquids approaching Newtonian ﬂow behavior
(Herbst et al., 1992 ).Nishikawa et al. (1981) differentiated between
mass transfer resulting from stirred and from bubbling systems,
although the latter contribution is usually negligible. The relationships
proposed by Höcker et al. (1981) andSchlüter and Deckwer (1992) are
the only approach considering the gas ﬂow rate rather than super ﬁcial
gas velocity; and that proposed by Albal et al. (1983) is unrealistic
because the in ﬂuence of gas ﬂow is not considered. In the presence of
biotransformation similar equations have been proposed and values
for these exponents have been reported ( Pedersen et al., 1994; Garcia-
Ochoa et al., 2000a ).
4.2. Bubble columns and airlift bioreactors
Bubble columns and airlift bioreactors are the two main types of
pneumatically agitated reactors. However, much more information
exists on gas –liquid mass transfer in conventional bubble columnsthan in airlift bioreactors. Encyclopedias, books or chapter of books(Merchuk, 1986; Chisti, 1989; Schügerl and Lübbert, 1995; Merchuk
and Gluz, 1999 ), several reviews ( Chisti, 1998; Kilonzo and Margaritis,
2004; Kantarci et al., 2005 ) and many papers ( Suh et al., 1991;
Wilkinson et al., 1994; Li et al., 1995; Eickenbusch et al., 1995; Al-Masry and Abasaeed, 1998; Sanchez et al., 2000; Vasconcelos et al.,
2003 ) deal with these reactor types.
Kilonzo and Margaritis (2004) have reviewed the effects of non-
Newtonian fermentation broth viscosities on gas –liquid mixing and
oxygen mass transfer characteristics in airlift bioreactors. Also, Letzel
et al. (1999) reported an increase of k
Lawith increasing pressure
caused by the increase in total gas hold-up; although, once a limit fornon-coalescence concentration has been reached, the increase is
much smaller. Moreover, with large reactors, the hydrostatic pressure
can be assumed to have an effect on k
La(Znad et al., 2004 ).
As in stirred tanks bioreactors, many empirical equations have been
proposed to estimate kLavalues in bubble columns and airlift reactors.
Dimensional equations establish relationships between kLaand
super ﬁcial gas velocity, the properties of the ﬂuid and the geometric
factors of bioreactor (height of the column, diameter of the column andsparger characteristics, mainly), although these last ones have re-
latively little in ﬂuence. Thus, the volumetric mass transfer coef ﬁcient
is expressed by dimensional equations generally in the form:
k
La=C/C1Va
s/C1μb
a ð32Þ
For classical bubble columns and using pure water, Deckwer et al.
(1974, 1983) determined values of the constant, C, and of the expo-
nent, a, of 0.47 and 0.82, respectively. In saline solutions they propose
for the constant Cvalues between 0.12 and 9.5 and for the exponent,
a, between 0.72 and 1.28. For non-Newtonian ﬂuids the apparent
viscosity is introduced in the equations and the exponent b takes a
value between −0.8 and −1(Godbole et al., 1984 ).
For internal loop airlift reactor, ascending ﬂow by the circular and
descendent crown by the central zone, Halard et al. (1989) have
veriﬁed that the equation proposed by Godbole et al. (1984) , for classic
bubble columns, can be used for non-Newtonian ﬂuids.
In the case of external loop airlift reactor, expressions based on the
ratio of down-comer to riser cross sectional area ( AD/AR), the effective
viscosity of the dissolution and other ﬂuid-dynamic parameters have
been proposed ( Bello et al., 1984; Popovic and Robinson, 1989 ):

negative and therefore a decrease in kLais predicted with increasing
down-comer to riser cross sectional area ratio ( AD/AR). The ( AD/AR)
ratio is a key design parameter, which controls the hydrodynamics of
the system, and thus also the oxygen transfer rate in airlift reactors.
Furthermore, the correlations of Popovic and Robinson (1989) andLi
et al. (1995) include a problematic de ﬁnition of the apparent viscosity,
deﬁning shear rate as a linear function of the gas velocity. This
approach can be questionable from a rheological point of viewbecause it will predict the same shear rate for a certain super ﬁcial gas
velocity, no matter which liquid is used ( Kawase and Hashiguchi,
1996; Chisti, 1998 ).
In the same way as in stirred tanks, the equations based on
dimensionless numbers predict the k
Lacoefﬁcient, included on
number of Sherwood ( kLaD2/DL), as a function of other dimensionless
numbers: Schmidt ( μ/DLρ), Bondenstein ( gD2ρ/σ), Galileo ( gD3ρ2/μ2),
Froude ( VS/gD), Deborah ( λVS(1+ɛ)/ɛdb) and Weissenberg ( Nc/τ).
Different equations proposed are given in Table 6 ; among these
equations, that from Akita and Yoshida (1973) is the most amply
used, although it is limited to bubble columns with diameter less to
0.6 m and a simple gas sparger. The equation proposed by Suh et al.
(1991) has been employed successfully by these authors to correlate
kLavalues in the production of the extracellular polysaccharide
xanthan by Xanthomonas campestris in bubble columns and air-
lifts ( Suh et al., 1992 ); however the apparent viscosity was calcu-
lated assuming the shear rate to be equal to 2800· VS. It should be
emphasized that the validity and application of these correlations
depend very much on the measurements of the ﬂow behavior of theliquid and also on the assumption regarding the estimation of arepresentative shear rate for predicting the apparent viscosity.
The value of k
Ladetermined for a microbial system can differ
substantially from those obtained for oxygen absorption in water orin simple aqueous solutions, i.e., in static systems with an invariable
composition of the liquid media along the time. Hence k
Lavalues
should be determined in the biosuspension, which involve the actual
media and microbial population.
5. Prediction of oxygen transfer rate
Although a large amount of experimental data and a number of
equations to predict oxygen mass transfer rate are available, it should
also be stressed that none of the overall correlations for kLahave
universal applicability. Therefore, to further explain the gas– liquid
mass transfer phenomena, it is important to know the in ﬂuence of
hydrodynamic factors on kLand a,independently.
5.1. Mass transfer coef ﬁcient prediction
The mass transfer coef ﬁcient kLin bioreactors can be estimated by a
large number of equations ( Table 7 ). Most of them are empirical
(Johnson and Huang, 1956; Calderbank and Moo-Young, 1961; Perez
and Sandall, 1974 ) and others have a theoretical base ( Prasher and
Wills, 1973; Kawase et al., 1987; Kawase et al., 1992a; Zhang and
Thomas, 1996 ). The theoretical models to predict the mass transfer
coefﬁcient are divided according to different approaches. Some of
them are based on the concept of a rigid interface ( Whitman, 1923 ),
others in an interface where surface renewal occurs through thedisplacement of liquid at the interface ( Higbie, 1935; Danckwerts,
1951; Lamont and Scott,1970 ) or a combination of those concepts ( Toor
and Marchelo, 1958 ). These models are summarized in Table 8 .
Higbie's penetration theory is widely accepted for gas– liquid
transfer description ( Kawase et al., 1987; Tobajas et al., 1999; Garcia-
Ochoa and Gomez, 2005; Billet and Schultes, 1993; Kawase andHashiguchi, 1996; Shimizu et al., 2000, 2001 ). The physical concept
behind the penetration theory is that there is a continual attachmentand detachment of small liquid eddies at the gas –liquid interface; in
the interval of attachment, there is an interchange of solute bymolecular diffusion. When a gas bubble moves through a liquid it
continually creates new interfacial area at its advancing tip and,
assuming a non-stationary diffusion of the liquid elements in the gas–Table 5

It has been determined that kLdepends on the turbulence intensity,
expressed as a function of the dissipated energy ( Lamont and Scott,1970;
Prasher and Wills, 1973 ), while the surface renewal rate is considerably
higher than that found for bubbles in free rise under potential ﬂow
(Figueiredo and Calderbank, 1979 ). Consequently, the experimental
results would show that the exposure time is necessarily affected by
eddies or turbulence at a microscopic scale. Therefore, the rate of
dissipation of energy in the liquid per mass unit, ɛ,i st h em o s ta d e q u a t e
magnitude to characterize the time scale. The exposure time, te, that
characterizes the residence time of micro-eddies at the interface, isgenerally unknown, but can be estimated by an adequate model. The
evaluation of that time can be realized according to the Kolmogoroff's
theory of isotropic turbulence, as the ratio of two characteristic
parameters of eddies, namely, the eddy length, η, and the ﬂuctuation
velocity, u. Both parameters depend on the rate of dissipation of energy
per mass unit, ɛ, and the cinematic viscosity, ν, according to:
η=m3

The exposure time is usually taken as the time that the bubbles
take to travel a length equal to its diameter, and it is estimated using
the ratio between eddy length and the ﬂuctuation velocity of
Kolgomoroff. This ratio for calculation of the exposure time valuehas been previously used in some works for the prediction of the
volumetric mass transfer coef ﬁcient in bubble columns and external
loop airlifts ( Kawase et al., 1987; Kawase and Hashiguchi, 1996 ).
If the rheological model of Ostwald-de Waele is considered for
description of non-Newtonian ﬂow behaviour of ﬂuids, the following
equation is obtained ( Kawase et al., 1987; Garcia-Ochoa and Gomez,

When the theoretical prediction of mass transfer coefﬁ cient is
performed in bubble columns and airlift reactors with non-Newtonian
ﬂuids, the approach of the Ostwald-de Waele model is usually adopted
(Kawase et al., 1987; Kawase and Hashiguchi, 1996; Tobajas et al.,
1999 ). For Newtonian media ( n=1; k=μ;μc=μand αr=0), both

Garcia-Ochoa and Gomez (2005) have made the sensitivity

concluding that a good agreement is reached in general.
Kawase et al. (1992a) have applied Higbie's model, considering that
the exposure time at a free surface of a ﬂuid element in turbulent
ﬂows can be replaced for the sub-layer development time. They obtain
the following equation for estimation of mass transfer coef ﬁcient:

5.2. Prediction of speci ﬁc interfacial area
The interfacial area can be calculated from the values of the
average bubble size, db, and the gas hold-up, ϕ, assuming spherical
bubbles, by the following equation ( Fukuma et al., 1987; Kawase et al.,
1987; Wilkinson et al., 1994; Tobajas et al., 1999 ):
a=6/
dbð41Þ
The interfacial area can be increased by creating smaller bubbles or
increasing the number of bubbles. For a given volume of gas, a greater
interfacial area, a, is provided if the gas is dispersed into many small
bubbles rather than a few large ones.
The speci ﬁc interfacial area, a, is a strong function of the
geometrical design and of the hydrodynamics into the bioreactor.Bioreactor design affects gas dispersion, hold up and the residence
time of the bubbles. The properties of the medium also signi ﬁcantly
affect the bubble sizes and coalescence and therefore the interfacialarea.
The presence of solutes in the liquid phase, as is well known, can
affect the mass transfer by changing the liquid phase physicochemical
properties, disturbing the bubble coalescing behavior and the bubble
size. In coalescent ﬂuids (water or viscous liquids) the collisions
among the bubbles lead to the formation of large bubbles whichreduce the speci ﬁc interfacial area. With an increase of viscosity, only
the turbulent eddies with sufﬁ ciently high energy can penetrate
through the boundary layer and the resistance to the mass transfer
increases.
5.3. Speci ﬁc interfacial area in stirred tank bioreactors
The stirrer speed and the mixing intensity play a major role in the
breaking up of bubbles. As indicated before, the mechanical design of
the bioreactor affects the gas dispersion, the hold-up and the
residence time of the bubbles. Baf ﬂes are used to create turbulence
and shear, which break up the bubbles. Although speci ﬁc interfacial
area values have been obtained by both physical and chemical
methods, the accuracy of the measurement is generally very poorTable 8

the determination of the speci ﬁc interfacial area in stirred tank
reactors can be found ( Joshi et al., 1982; Barigou and Greaves, 1996 ),
although their application is very limited.
Gas hold-up, ϕ, can be estimated by the equation derived by
Kudrewizki (1982) using the isotropic turbulence theory, as follows:

In this equation, lis the Kolmogoroff length scale and, assuming
that the size of the bubbles formed in the turbulent regime is affected
by the stirrer speed, the following equation for lhas been proposed
(Kudrewizki and Rabe, 1986 ):

When the liquid phase is viscous, the above equation needs to be

In isotropic turbulent ﬂow, the ﬂuctuating velocity, u, is dependent
on the length scale of the turbulent eddy at equilibrium, l, and on
the rate of dissipation of energy per mass unit, ɛ, according to the
following equation:
u=e/C1lðÞ1=3ð46Þ
The dynamic pressure force can be expressed in terms of the ﬂuc-
tuating velocity, u, and assuming lto be of the same order of magni-
tude as the bubble diameter, db, and the following equation is obtained:

ð47Þ
On the other hand, the equilibrium bubble diameter can be ob-
tained by balance between the dynamic pressure force exerted on the
bubble by the turbulent liquid ﬂow, producing the bubble break-up,
and the resistance forces (surface tension force and the resistance ofthe liquid phase to deformation, although the latter is usually small).
The ratio between surface tension and turbulent ﬂuctuation forces is
theWeber dimensionless number, We, which can be assumed to have
a constant value, according to:
We=τ/C1d

Combining Eqs. (47) and (48), the following equation is derived:

In the literature many equations have been proposed for different
systems using this relationship ( Calderbank,1958; Parthasarathy et al.,
1991 ). Also, Bhavaraju et al. (1978) have found that bubble break-updepends on viscosity and liquid phase turbulence and have proposed
the following equation for average bubble size:
db=0 :7/C1σ0:6

L/C1μL
μG/C18/C190:1

where µGis the gas viscosity and µLrepresents the viscosity for pure
Newtonian ﬂuids.
5.4. Speci ﬁc interfacial area in bubble columns and airlift bioreactors
The average bubble size in a bubble column has also been found to
be affected by gas velocity, liquid properties, gas distribution,
operating pressure and column diameter. Many literature correlations
have been proposed to predict the hold-up ( Hughmark, 1967; Kawase
et al.,1992a) and size of bubbles ( Calderbank,1958; Calderbank,1959 ).
Kawase and Moo-Young (1990) and Kantarci et al. (2005) have
reviewed these ﬂuid-dynamic parameters of bubbles columns used
for bioprocesses. Recently, Nedeltchev et al. (2007) have developed an
empirical equation for estimation of abased on the geometrical
characteristics (bubble length and height) of oblate ellipsoidal bubbleformed in bubble columns with homogeneous regime under high
pressure.
The gas hold-up is necessarily related to the super ﬁcial gas velocity
and the mean bubble rise velocity, according to:
/=Vs
USð51Þ
In airlift contactors the expression relating the gas hold-up in the
riser to the liquid velocities and gas slip velocity can be written as
(Garcia-Calvo and Leton, 1991 ):
/=Vs
Us+1 =2VLC+¯VLRð52Þ
where VSis the super ﬁcial gas velocity, Usis the terminal rise velocity
of the bubble, VLCis the average velocity in the core region and VLRis
the average linear velocity.
On the above equation, VLCis calculated taking into account several
assumptions, such as a parabolic pro ﬁle for liquid velocity, the
complete gas disengagement in the down-comer and hence, gas is
not present in that reactor section ( Garcia-Calvo and Leton, 1991 ).
The equilibrium bubble size under turbulence conditions can be
calculated by Eq. (50) or be estimated from empirical equations. The
most frequently used is that proposed by Calderbank (1958, 1959) for
coalescent systems:
db=4 :15/C1σ0:6
P
V/C0/C10:4/C1ρ0:2
L/C1/0:5+9/C110−4ð53Þ
and for non-coalescent ﬂuids:
db=1 :93/C1σ0:6
P
V/C0/C10:4/C1ρ0:2
Lð54Þ
For air water systems, the equilibrium bubble diameter, db,i s
usually assumed to be equal to 6 mm, and the gas the terminal rise
velocity of bubble, Us, to be equal to 0.25 m·s−1; both values are widely
accepted in the literature ( Tobajas et al., 1999 ).
5.5. Power input requirements
Power consumption is a signi ﬁcant part of the operating cost for
large-scale systems. On the other hand, in order to determine kLby
Eqs. (37) –(39), the local energy dissipation rate, ɛ, near the interface
needs to be estimated. It is assumed that energy at the gas– liquid165 F. Garcia-Ochoa, E. Gomez / Biotechnology Advances 27 (2009) 153 –176interface is consumed in the contact between liquid elements and gas
bubbles. The power requirement for non-gassed Newtonian ﬂuids is
characterized by a dimensionless power number, Np, which is the
ratio of the external force to the inertial force exerted by the ﬂuid. It
has been shown by dimensional analysis that the power delivered toan incompressible ﬂuid by a rotating impeller in stirred tanks is
proportional to the agitation rate raised to the third power and the
impeller diameter raised to the ﬁfth power ( Rushton et al., 1950 ).
Therefore, the average energy dissipation rate per mass unit in stirredtanks can be calculated as:
e≈e
ave=P0
ρπ=4T2H=NPN3T5
Vð55Þ
There are many nonlinear correlations of NPas function of
Reynolds number and other dimensionless groups for different
geometries of unaerated vessels ( Masiuk et al., 1992; Netusil and
Rieger, 1993 ). In laminar ﬂow regime, the value of P0, is inversely
proportional to the Reynolds number value. In the turbulent regime
(ReN104),P0can be evaluated easily from experimental power curves,
taking into account that the power number, NP, can be considered
constant, although its value depends on the stirrer type and geometry.
In gassed (aerated) systems, the presence of gas has an effect on
power consumption. The sparged gas bubbles reduce density and
therefore decrease power consumption. Thus, the power consumption
in the case of aerated systems, P, is always lower than that consumed
in an un-aerated system, Po.Michel and Miller (1962) showed that for
Newtonian ﬂuids a good estimate of Pcan be obtained using the
following relationship:
P=α/C1P2
0/C1N/C1T3
Q0;56/C18/C19 β
ð56Þ
where the constants αandβdepend on the stirrer type and on the
conﬁguration of the system agitation. Abrardi et al. (1988) have used
this equation to describe experimental data in a wide range of
operational conditions, obtaining values for αandβof 0.783 and
0.459 respectively, for a simple impeller Rushton turbine; while fordual impeller system the values are 1.224 and 0.432, respectively.
In order to use Eqs. (37) –(39) for estimation of k
Lin bubble
columns and airlifts, the power input from sparging air through a
bioreactor must be obtained. In these systems, gas sparging must
supply all the energy for the required bulk mixing and mass transfer.
From the macroscopic energy balance on the gas phase at steady-
state, the power consumption per liquid volume can be evaluated
from:
Δ1
2/C1U2/C18/C19
+ΔEp+∫p2
p1dpρ
G+¯W+¯Ev=0 ð57Þ
where Urepresents the gas velocity; ΔEPis the change of potential
energy per mass unit; Evmeans the frictional losses of energy per
mass unit; and Wis the work produced by the gas ﬂow.
In the case of bubble column bioreactors, if the kinetic energy of
the gas leaving the column and the frictional losses are assumed to be
negligible, the following equation for pneumatic power input (Blanch
and Clark, 1996; Sanchez et al., 2000 ) is obtained:
P

Garcia-Calvo (1989, 1992) has proposed a ﬂuid-dynamic model for
two-phase systems that predicts the energy dissipation at the gas–
liquid interface, S, by using the following expression:
S=//C1Vs/C1ρ/C1g/C1H ð60Þ
It is assumed that the energy dissipated at the gas –liquid interface
is consumed in the contact between eddies and the gas bubble:
e=S
ρ/C1H=//C1Vs/C1g ð61Þ
Thus, the volumetric mass transfer coef ﬁcient in bioreactors can
be correlated and predicted taking into account the above equations
for energy dissipated (Eqs. (55) to (61) and equations for mass
transfer coef ﬁcient, kL, (Eqs. (37) –(39)) and speci ﬁc interfacial area, a
(Eq. (41)).
5.6. Comrison between experimental and predicted k La values
Frequently, broths are simulated with solutions of different sub-
stances with similar rheological properties using identical operational
conditions and vessel geometrical parameters. Many fermentation
media containing polymeric substances (such as polysaccharides)
show non-Newtonian ﬂow behavior. Most works on the subject have
studied the effect of pseudo-plasticity on volumetric mass transfercoefﬁcient in simulated culture broths ( Perez and Sandall, 1974; Yagi
and Yoshida, 1975; Nishikawa et al., 1981; Garcia-Ochoa and Gomez,1998, 2001 ).
By combination of the equations for mass transfer coef ﬁcient, k
L,
(Eqs. (37) –(39)) and speci ﬁc interfacial area, a, (Eq. (41)) from gas
hold-up, ϕ, (Eq. (45)) and average bubble size, db, (Eq. (50)) it is
possible to predict the in ﬂuence of operational conditions, properties
of liquid and geometrical parameters of the vessels on the volumetric
mass transfer coef ﬁcient, kLa. The capability of prediction of those
equations has been checked making a comparison of kLaexperimental
values and some data obtained from correlations published for stirred
tank reactors of different geometries, for Newtonian and non-
Newtonian ﬂuids ( Yagi and Yoshida, 1975; Van't Riet, 1979; Chan-
drasekharan and Calderbank, 1981; Linek et al., 1991; Pedersen et al.,1994; Vasconcelos et al., 2000; Garcia-Ochoa and Gomez, 2001 ). As an
example, in Fig. 8 ,k
Lavalues predicted for Newtonian ﬂuids for
sparged stirred tank reactors for 50 L of volume are shown as a
function of the power input per volume unit. In Fig. 9 , the model
predictions of kLavalues for non-Newtonian systems are shown as a

obtained by different authors for water and viscous liquids (xanthan
gum solutions and sodium poly-acrylate). As can be observed, the kLa
experimental values are in good agreement with those obtained usingthe proposed model.
Fig. 10 shows a comparison between some available data of k
Lain
stirred tank reactors and the values calculated by the proposed modelover a wide range of vessel diameters (from 1.2·10
−2to 1.5 m), for
different stirrer types, for both Newtonian and non-Newtonian liquids(Van't Riet, 1979; Chandrasekharan and Calderbank, 1981; Nishikawa
et al., 1981; Linek et al., 1991; Pedersen et al., 1994; Vasconcelos et al.,2000; Garcia-Ochoa and Gomez, 2001 ). As can be seen the differences
between experimental and predicted values are lower than 15% inmost cases.
On the other hand, Garcia-Calvo et al. (1999) have used a simple
model to simulate the ﬂuid-dynamic and mass transfer in a three-
phase airlift reactor. The ﬂuid-dynamic model is based on an energy
balance which takes into account the energy dissipated at the
interfaces. The mass transfer model is based on a previous two-
phase ﬂuid-dynamic model ( Garcia-Calvo, 1992 ), the Higbie's penetra-
tion theory and the Kolmogorof's theory of isotropic turbulence.
Shimizu et al. (2000, 2001 ) have developed a phenomenological
model for bubble break-up and coalescence in bubble column andairlift reactors. In order to describe bubble movements in a bubble
column, a compartment concept is combined with the population
balance model for bubble break-up and coalescence. The bubble
column is assumed to consist on a series of discrete compartments in
which bubble break-up and coalescence occur and bubbles move from
compartment to compartment with different velocities. The volu-
metric mass transfer coef ﬁcient, k
La, was evaluated using the relation-
ship for the speci ﬁc surface area, a, related to gas hold-up and Higbie's
penetration theory for kL. The values given by the proposed model
were in good agreement with the experimental data given in the paperand also with some available data in the literature. According to these
authors, for the general applicability of this model in airlift bioreactors,
data on gas hold-ups and volumetric mass transfer coefﬁ cients in
larger external-loop reactors, including commercial-scale reactors, arehighly desirable. Tobajas et al. (1999) have used a simple model to
simulate the ﬂuid-dynamic and mass transfer in a three-phase airlift
reactor. The mass transfer model is based on a ﬂuid-dynamic model
which takes into account the energy dissipated at the phase interfaces
(Garcia-Calvo, 1989, 1992; Garcia-Calvo and Leton, 1991; Garcia-Calvo
et al., 1999 ), the Higbie's penetration theory and Kolmogoroff's theory
of isotropic turbulence. Experimental data of gas hold-up, liquidvelocity and volumetric mass transfer coef ﬁcient were simulated with
satisfactory accuracy.
6. Inﬂuence of oxygen consumption on k
Lavalues
The study of oxygen transfer characteristic in fermentation broths
has usually been separated into the parameters related to transport
(studying the volumetric mass transfer coef ﬁcient, kLa, mainly) and
the oxygen consumption by microorganism (determining OUR). How-ever, correct prediction of OTR in a bioprocess must be made taking
into account the relationship between both of them.
Vashitz et al. (1989) have reported that the oxygen transfer coef ﬁ-
cient increases with the oxygen uptake rate of the microorganism in
X. campestris cultures; Calik et al. (1997) have described the oxygen
transfer effects on growth of Pseudomonas dacunhae for
L-alanine
production; and Calik et al. (2004, 2006) describes the oxygen transfer
effects on benzaldehyde lyase production by Escherichia coli; all of
them have found an enhancement on oxygen transfer rate due to the
oxygen consumed by the microorganism. Djelal et al. (2006) have
found that kLavalues determined by the classical dynamic methods in
sterile culture medium and after inoculation of culture, were of thesame order of magnitude; however, the values were higher in presence
of biomass (0.0026 s
−1) compared to sterile medium (0.0018 s−1), since
oxygen transfer was improved by its consumption by cells.
The variation of the speci ﬁc gas absorption rate, per driving force
and interfacial area units, due to the presence of the dispersed phase,in this case the microorganism, has been characterized by a biological
enhancement factor, E. The following section is devoted to this factor.
7. Biological enhancement factor estimation
Taking into account the possible mass transfer enhancement over
physical absorption in a biological system (due to the oxygen con-sumption by the microorganism), a biological enhancement factor, E,
is deﬁned as the ratio of the absorption ﬂux of oxygen in the presence
of a third dispersed phase (in this case the microorganism) to the
absorption ﬂux without it under the same hydrodynamic conditions
and driving force for mass transfer, according to:
E=
J
J0=KLa
kLað62Þ
The extent of this enhancement can be derived for different theories
for mass transfer; a simple model is the one corresponding to the ﬁlm
model. Some works in the literature have discussed the biological
enhancement factor for oxygen absorption into fermentation broth, and

values as a function of super ﬁcial gas velocity for different non-Newtonian systems.

used ( Tsao, 1969; Merchuk, 1977; Ju and Sundararajan, 1992 ). Recently,
Garcia-Ochoa and Gomez (2005) have proposed a model for the
estimation of the biological enhancement factor in bioreactors. This
model considers three layers in series; therefore, to describe the oxygen
mass transport three mass transfer resistances are considered for the
biological system (see Fig. 11 ): (i) the interfacial surfactant ﬁlm
resistance, (ii) the mono-layers of adsorbed microorganisms resistance,and (iii) the liquid ﬁlm resistance. The different layer resistances are
taken into account by the diffusion coef ﬁcient ( D
i) by the inside of thelayer and by layer thickness ( zi). According to this model, the biological

concentration in the liquid and in equilibrium with the air stream,
respectively.
Theﬁrst bracket in Eq. (63) is always ≥1 and is a function of the
Hatta number, taking into account the transport enhancement due
to the oxygen uptake by the microorganisms. The Hatta dimensionless

The second bracket of Eq. (63) is ≤1, representing the physical
blocking effect due to the absorbed surfactant ﬁlm, the cell adsorption
to the bubbles surface, considering those as semi-permeable solid par-
ticles hindering the movement of diffusing oxygen molecules, and the
liquid ﬁlm. Depending on the relative values of both terms, the enhance-
ment factor, E, can take values smaller than, equal to or bigger than 1.

the ratio of the experimental oxygen mass transfer coef ﬁcient in the
presence of microorganism, KLa, and that measured into the same
medium in the absence of biomass at different conditions of oxygen
transfer, kLa). As can be observed, the Evalues obtained in the presence
of biomass can be higher than 1. The values Eb1 indicate that mass
transfer is accompanied by a slow uptake rate and a greatest resistanceto transport by the serial resistances above commented. Also, bio-
logical enhancement factor values have been estimated from Eq. (63)
and represented in the same Figs. 12 and 13 as lines; as can be seen the
agreement between experimental and predicted values is good.
8. Scale-up and oxygen transfer rate in aerobic bioprocesses
As already indicated, the oxygen transfer rate can control the
overall rate of the bioprocess, and as a consequence, it can determine
the capacity of a bioreactor. For this reason the oxygen transfer rate
condition has been often chosen as the main criterion for scaling-up.
The prediction of the results to be obtained in an industrial scale, from
the data collected in laboratory or pilot plant scales, requires a careful
analysis of the in ﬂuence of the operational conditions on the
biological behavior of the system.
Key to scale-up using constant oxygen transfer rate (OTR) is the
ability to measure or estimate the volumetric mass transfer coefﬁ -
cient, k
La. A high number of correlations are available for the
volumetric mass transfer coef ﬁcient, but often the results from
different equations are not in agreement with others ( Garcia-Ochoa
and Gomez, 1998; Gogate et al., 2000; Sanchez et al., 2000 ). Therefore
they are being displaced by theoretical or predictive models, based on
more fundamental principles.
In a bioprocess, according Eqs. (1) and (62), the oxygen mass
transfer rate, NO2, can be rewritten as:
NO2=a/C1J=a/C1E/C1J0=kGa/C1pG−pi ðÞ =E/C1kLaC i−CL ðÞ ð65Þ
where Jis the absorption ﬂux of oxygen in presence of microorganism,
ais the interfacial area, kGand kLare mass transfer coef ﬁcient and Eis
the biological enhancement factor.
Considering the overall volumetric mass transfer coefﬁ cients, it can
be written:
NO2=KGa/C1pG−p⁎/C16/C17
=KLa/C1C⁎−CL/C16/C17
ð66Þ
being:
1
KLa=1
H/C1kGa+1
E/C1kLað67Þ
It can be observed that the overall volumetric mass transfer
coefﬁcient in the presence of a biochemical reaction, KLa, is a lumped
parameter comprising the resistance to mass transport of oxygen due
to gas and liquid phase resistances, and also due to the oxygen
consumption, which can be taken into account by a biological
enhancement factor, E. Assuming that the gas phase resistance can
usually be neglected, the overall resistance to transport can be writtenas:
K
La=E/C1kLa ð68Þ
When biochemical reaction does not take place or when its rate is
not much greater than the mass transfer rate, E=1 and the overall
mass transfer coef ﬁcient will be denoted by kLaand the ﬂux by Jo.
Thus, volumetric mass transfer coef ﬁcient in bioreactors can be
predicted considering theoretical equations for kL(Eqs. (37) –(39)) and
a(Eq. (41)) coupled to the equation for the estimation of the biological
enhancement factor, E(Eq. (63)). The input parameters necessary can
be categorized into four groups:i. the system physical properties ( μL,σ,ρL,DL,C⁎);
ii. the biochemical properties (Cx m,zm,qo2);
iii. the operational conditions (V S, N, P/V),
iv. and the geometrical parameters of bioreactor (kind and size of
bioreactor, design and number of stirrers, etc.).
The parameters in the ﬁrst two groups are determined by the
nature of the system and can not be altered freely; the last two groups
depend on the process parameters and on the device used.
There are ﬁve different items needed for the design of bioreactors
(Kawase and Moo-Young, 1990): Stoichiometry, thermodynamics,
microbial kinetics, transport phenomena (heat and mass transfer)
and economics. Stoichiometry, thermodynamics and kinetics are
scale-independent phenomena. Transport phenomena and economics
are highly dependent on scale. Moreover, usually mass transport rates
govern the aerobic bioprocess overall rate.
Scale-up is a procedure for the design and construction of a large
scale system (where the scale is typically from 30 to1000 m3) on the
basis of the results of experiments with small-scale equipment (wherethe scale is typically from 1 to 25 L). The scale-up of a bioprocess can
be classi ﬁed into three main scales ( Ju and Chase, 1992, Junker, 2004 ):
i)laboratory , where elementary studies are carried out; ii) pilot plant ,
where the bioprocess optimizations are determined; and iii) produc-
tion scale , where the bioprocess is brought to economic realization.
Recently, the shake- ﬂask and micro scales can be added to the list
(Micheletti et al., 2006 ), some characteristics of mass transfer in
miniature bioreactors are commented in the following sub-section.
8.1. OTR in miniature bioreactors. Scale-up and scale-down
Bioprocess development (strain selection, strain enhancement,
process optimisation) has traditionally required the screening of large
numbers of cell lines in shake ﬂask cultures. Afterwards, further
testing of successful candidates in laboratory scale bioreactors prior to
pilot plant studies is usually performed. The need for carrying out a
vast number of cultures has resulted in the increasingly widespread
development of shake- ﬂask and micro scale bioreactor systems. These
systems offer a miniaturised, high-throughput solution to bioprocessdevelopment.
Miniature bioreactors (MBRs) can reduce the labour intensity and
material costs of the vast number of fermentative experiments
necessary in bioprocess development, increasing the level of paralle-
lism and throughput achievement, both highly interesting areas
(Lamping et al., 2003; Doig et al., 2005; Betts and Baganz, 2006; Zhang
et al., 2007; Gill et al., 2008; Li et al., 2008 ). It is important that such
devices be very reliable to accurately mimic laboratory and pilot scale
bioreactors when used for bioprocess development. Therefore, growthkinetics and product formation –optimised at micro scale –can be
expected to be scaled-up quantitatively. Work by Micheletti et al.
(2006) shows that scale translation from shaken to stirred systems is
feasible if scale-up criteria are carefully chosen. These results provideinitial data on satisfactory scale up of a mammalian cell culture pro-
cess, using a constant mean energy dissipation rate. Moreover, the
micro scale device reported by Lamping et al. (2003) was a scaled-
down version of conventional stirred tank bioreactors machined fromPlexiglas and equipped with four baf ﬂes, stirrer and sparger.
Betts and Baganz (2006) have compared different reported MBRs
illustrating performance speci ﬁcations and its description based on
their agitation system, considering the type of conventional bioreac-tors either imitated or derived from. According to these authors, MBRs
can be classi ﬁed in shaken ( ﬂask, microtiter and spin tubes), stirred,
bubble column miniature bioreactors and other miniature devices.
Many techniques have been applied for determination of k
Lain
MBRs. In fact, the dynamic method of gassing-out is the most usualmethod. The values reported (up to 0.4 s
−1) depend on the miniature
bioreactors used, and the ef ﬁciency of agitation and aeration systems.169 F. Garcia-Ochoa, E. Gomez / Biotechnology Advances 27 (2009) 153 –176Doig et al. (2005) estimated kLaby three methods (the dynamic
gassing out method, by mass balance of the inlet and exit gasses, and
by mass balance from the growth rate under oxygen limitation in Ba-
cillus subtilis cultures) in a prototype miniature bubble column bio-
reactor. There are also speci ﬁc methods available for determining kLa
atmicro scale devices which provide data that are directly comparable
with values obtained under actual process conditions. Thus, Duetz
et al. (2000) and Duetz and Witholt (2004) estimated OTR by mass
balance under conditions of oxygen limitation from the linear growthofPseudomonas putida and by enzymatic oxidation of glucose coupled
to a secondary reaction in microtiter plates. Recently a novel methodbased on the bio-oxidation of catechol by the enzyme catechol-2,3-
dioxygenase has been reported ( Ortiz-Ochoa et al., 2005 ).
The most commonly used culture vessel in bioprocess develop-
ment is the shaken ﬂask: Erlenmeyer ﬂasks (100 –2000 ml) ﬁlled with
low volumes of media (10 –25%) are shaken to promote ﬂuid mixing
and gas –liquid mass transfer via surface aeration. Therefore, the major
limitation of shake ﬂasks is their dependence on surface aeration,
leading to reduced oxygen transfer compared to that achieved in
stirred tank bioreactors. Liu et al. (2006) have measured k
Lavalues in
the shake- ﬂasks (using the sulphite method). They found that kLa
decreases with the liquid volume in ﬂask and increases with the
shaker speed. In this study kLawas correlated to shaker speed and
liquid volume by the following equation:
kLa=0 :141 N0:88VL
Vo/C18/C19−0:80
ð69Þ
The small difference in absolute values of the indices on Nand VL
implies that the two variables have a similar impact on the oxygen
transfer rate.
Several changes to the conventional Erlenmeyer ﬂask have been
proposed in order to increase oxygen mass transfer. Kato and Tanaka
(1998) incorporated gas-permeable membranes in the upper corners
of their prototype ﬂasks, which allowed a more effective gas ﬂow into
the vessel during shaking. This modi ﬁcation overcame the problem
found in conventional shake ﬂasks when the addition of more sterile
air into the system is needed to avoid inhibition of microbial growth
due to oxygen depletion. kLavalues of 0.042 s−1(600 mL, 200 rpm) to
0.077 s−1(100 mL, 200 rpm) were recorded in a novel, box-shaped,
shake ﬂask system.
In bioprocesses carried out in stirred tank bioreactors when the
oxygen uptake rate is high, the introduction of baf ﬂes can increase
OTR due to increasing power input ( Peter et al., 2006 ). However,
hydrodynamic stress produced in both baf ﬂed and unbaf ﬂed shake
ﬂasks could slow down the growth rate ( Garcia Camacho et al., 2007 )
or alter production rates, e.g. production of 6-pentyl- α-pyrone by
Trichoderma harzianum (Galindo et al., 2004 ).
The use of shaken microtiter plates (microplates) is becoming a
good alternative to the shaken ﬂask. Limits to these new systems are
the relatively low rates of oxygen transfer, complexities with instru-
mentation and scaling-up dif ﬁculties. Microtiter plates can either be
rectangular or cylindrical, with square geometries improving mixingand oxygen transfer by mimicking the action of baf ﬂes. A major
determinant of good oxygen transfer is the shaking amplitude andfrequency, as well as the shape and size of the wells. The square shape
in the horizontal plane results in a turbulent shaking pattern and,
therefore, better mimics the situation in stirred tank bioreactors
than round well microtiter plates do. Maximum OTR of about
16.4 mmol L
−1h−1in round wells and 38 mmol L−1h−1in square
deep-well microtiter plates ( kLabetween 0.028 and 0.052 s−1)h a v e
been reported ( Duetz et al., 2000; Duetz and Witholt, 2004 ).
Recently spin tubes have been developed and used as a small scale
process development tool for cultivation of mammalian cells. The
relatively large volume and low evaporation rate found in this device
are adequate for dealing with slow-growing mammalian cells, wherecultures can be many days in duration. The most critical parameters in
these cultures are pH and dissolved oxygen concentration. Never-
theless, De Jesus et al. (2004) have found that the interval of change
of oxygen concentration and pH during cultures in spin tubesare comparable to those observed in more sophisticated and bigger
bioreactors.
Miniature stirred bioreactors (MSBRs) based on conventional
stirrer tank reactors have been developed as an alternative to shakenMBR systems for early-stage process development and cell character-
isation. By providing agitation and aeration of the vessel, mass transfer
rates close to a conventional laboratory scale .Lamping et al. (2003)
have predicted (modelling oxygen transfer from Higbie's model withthe contact time obtained from the computational ﬂuid dynamics) and
they have measured (using the dynamic method) k
Lain a prototype
MSBR, obtaining values in the range 0.028 to 0.11 s−1.Gill et al. (2008)
have studied oxygen mass transfer characteristics as a function ofstirrer speed and aeration rates in a miniature bioreactor geometrically
similar to conventional laboratory scale stirred bioreactors, with k
La
values up to 0.11 s−1. Results achieved could be comparable to those
found in typical laboratory scale bioreactors.
As a novel alternative to shaken vessels at small scale and high
throughput cell culture, a miniaturized bubble column reactor (MBCR)
has been developed. This reactor is based on an MTP with porous
membranes acting as the entire base to each individual well. The
mechanical simplicity coupled with potentially high oxygen transfer
rate and ease of sampling makes MBCRs suitable for parallel cell
cultivation. Doig et al. (2005) have used a microplate bubble column
bioreactor that is capable of supporting the aerobic growing of Bacillus
subtilis in a working volume of 2 mL. kLavalues were reported up to
0.061 s−1using the dynamic gassing-out method at a super ﬁcial gas
velocity of 0.02 m s−1. Experimental data of kLaﬁtted to Eq. (32) found:
kLa=0 :65/C1V0:6
S ð70Þ
As indicated above, it can observed ( Table 5 ) that the effect of the
super ﬁcial gas velocity on kLais similar to that in bubble column
bioreactors.
Thus, MBR technology promises to enable faster, less labour in-
tensive bioprocess development, with a huge reduction in reactive
amount needed and, thus, waste generation. However, there is no
single MBR that satis ﬁes all requirements equally, for OTR mainly. In
fact, there is a need to differentiate micro scale systems and the
advantages that each one confers depending on the application.
Therefore, different systems for different stages of the development of
a bioprocess can be used, taking into account its complexity and the
nature of the cells, especially the requirements of dissolved oxygen for
growing, monitoring, control, and sampling.
8.2. Bioreactor scale-up
Once a particular bioprocess is accomplished successfully in la-
boratory scale experiments, the values of the operating variables and
the physical properties are known or can be measured. The bioprocess
is then usually carried out in a number of bioreactors of increasing
scale, the ﬁnal process optimization being performed at pilot plant
scale (50 to 300 L of volume) where the operational conditions and thehydrodynamic and mixing are very similar to those used in the
production scale. The scale-up ratio is typically about 1:10 for bio-
processes, but lower ratios decrease the risk of unexpected perfor-
mance on scale-up. It can be done according to four different
approaches, as widely recognized: fundamental methods; semi-
fundamental methods; dimensional analysis; and rules of thumb.
Fundamental methods are those based on the application of
mathematical models for description of the in ﬂuence of operational
conditions and geometrical design of the bioreactor on the ﬂow
pattern in the bioreactor. Solution of the microscopic balances of170 F. Garcia-Ochoa, E. Gomez / Biotechnology Advances 27 (2009) 153 –176momentum and mass transfer is required. In recent years, computa-
tional ﬂuid dynamics has shown to be an effective tool to study the
hydrodynamics of reactors and scale-up of bioprocesses (Dhanase-kharan et al., 2005 ). These methods are very complicated, and
frequently, many simpli ﬁcations are required ( Vasconcelos et al.,
1998; Nedeltchev et al., 1999 ). Nevertheless, the development of
fundamental models able to describe the key characteristics of thesystem is perhaps the most helpful tool for successful scale-up and for
the determination of the optimal conditions at the production scale.
Semi-fundamental methods are those where simpli ﬁed equations
are applied to obtain a practical approximation to the bioprocess
operation. The parameters obtained will be scale dependent, and
thereby the in ﬂuence of scale on the process can be examined by
model simulations. However, despite the extensive simpli ﬁcation of
the problem when moving from the fundamental to semi-funda-
mental models, the complexity of the method is still substantial.
Dimensional analysis is based on keeping the values of dimension-
less groups of parameters constant during the scale-up. Thedimensionless groups used are ratios of rates or time constants for
the different mechanisms involved in bioprocess. Then, if all the
dimensionless groups are kept constant, the relative importance of the
mechanisms or phenomena involved in the process will not change
during scale-up. It is often impossible to keep all the dimensionless
groups constant during scale-up, hence one has to determine the most
important groups and deemphasize the rest.
The rule of thumb method is the most common method. The scale-
up criterion most used and percentage of each criteria used in the
fermentation industry are: constant speci ﬁc power input, P/V, (30% of
use); constant volumetric mass transfer coef ﬁcient, K
La(30%); con-
stant impeller tip speed of the agitator or shear (20%); and constant
dissolved oxygen concentration, CO2, (20%) ( Margaritis and Zajic,
1978 ). The different scale-up criteria normally result in entirely dif-
ferent process conditions on a production scale. Usually, it is im-
possible to maintain all the parameters in the same ratio to one
another. The consequences of such calculations, for two geometrically
similar stirred tank reactors with the model system volume (V =2 L)
and the production system volume, ( V=20 L) with linear scale-up
factor of 10 are shown in Table 9 . Analysis of the obtained results
shows that, for instance, scale-up based on constant P/V will increasethe maximum shear rate by 28% ( ND=1.28) and using a constant Re
number value is not a good scale-up criterion, because a very low P/V
value results ( P/V=0.05), which can provoke a de ﬁcient mixing.
Agitator tip speed like criteria has some advantages in the case ofbioprocesses with sensible micro-organisms over shear stress pro-
duced by stirrer, because it determines the maximum shear stress in
the tank, determining the possible cell damage, and also in ﬂuences the
stable size of ﬂocks and gas bubbles. However, its use entails a
reduction in the power input per unit volume and in the stirrer speed,
which causes a remarkable reduction of the rate of oxygen transport.
Therefore, it seems that the best criteria for scale up is to maintain thepower input per unit volume or the volumetric mass transfer
coefﬁcient constant ( Figueiredo and Calderbank, 1979; Shukla et al.,
2001 ). Thus, application of the rule of thumb method is very simple,but it is also a very fragile method, because a complete change in thelimiting regime can happen above a certain scale.
In practice, all four methods are used in combination with each
other and sometimes the trial and error method must also be
included. In general, it is impossible to scale up a bioprocess keeping
all conditions in the optimal values and it is necessary to choose which
variable is considered as the most important. Junker (2004) has
evaluated the different scale-up methods and approaches that have
been applied to Escherichia coli and yeast processes, ﬁnding that scale-
up from the 30 L laboratory scale typically under-predicted para-meters of industrial production and 280 L scale up parameters were
most similar to the production scale .
For the scale-up of aerobic fermentation, the effect of gas liquid
mass transport is the most signi ﬁcant factor. Therefore, scale-up in
aerobic fermentation is often performed on the basis of keeping thevolumetric mass transfer coef ﬁcient ( k
Laconstant) or, if CLis negligible
compared with C⁎in the culture broth, keeping OTR constant ( Herbst
et al., 1992; Garcia-Ochoa et al., 2000a; Shukla et al., 2001; Bandaiphet
and Prasertsan, 2006; Liu et al., 2006b ). The success of the scale-up
processes are usually con ﬁrmed by experimental results which show
that there is no difference between small and large scale fermentation
carried out under the same oxygen transfer rate.
On the other hand, although the kinetic parameters of growth and
oxygen consumption of microorganism must be scale independent,
the growth rate in a bioreactor is scale dependent because of the scale
dependency of oxygen transport rate. Another aspect making the
situation more complex is that some operational conditions necessary
for adequate mass transfer can produce negatives effects. The local
environment of the cells in large industrial bioreactors varies over a
higher range than in small laboratory bioreactors, because of the
higher heterogeneity of the cultivation medium caused by the longer
global mixing time, the turbulence intensity, and thus local shearTable 9

Fig. 14. Evolution of apparent viscosity and volumetric mass transfer coef ﬁcient on the
course of fermentation of Xanthomonas campestris during xanthan gum production
(using an increasing of stirrer speed) (adapted from Garcia-Ochoa and Gomez, 2005 ).171 F. Garcia-Ochoa, E. Gomez / Biotechnology Advances 27 (2009) 153 –176forces are exacerbated with the increasing scale of bioreactors; under
these conditions, cellular stress can affect growth ( Kieran et al., 2000 ).
For the scale-up of toyocamycin production by a shear-sensitivemutant of Streptomyces chrestomyceticus the OTR constant method
could be not used and thus scale-up was done at the lowest possibletip speed for the geometrically similar larger vessel (Flickinger et al.,1990 ).
The oxygen transfer rate into the microbial cell in aerobic bio-
processes strongly affects growth and product formation by in ﬂuen-
cing metabolic pathways and changing metabolic ﬂuxes ( Calik et al.,
2004; Martin et al., 2005; Gomez et al., 2006 ); therefore, to ﬁne-tune
bioreactor performance in relation with the physiology of the micro-organism and operational conditions for the extent of oxygen transfer,
the requirement must be clari ﬁed.
When the mass transfer coef ﬁcient, k
La, is relatively high, no
inﬂuence of the oxygen uptake by the microorganism can be detected
because the enhancement is very small. However, the situation maychange in the case of cultures with high oxygen uptake rate or with
high viscous broth, where the decrease of k
Ltogether with the activity
of the microorganism enhances oxygen mass transfer, and kLa
observed is increased signi ﬁcantly compared to physical absorption
(inert conditions).
Xanthan production by X. campestris cultivation is an example
of this kind of systems. Xanthan gum fermentation includes animportant in ﬂuence of viscosity broth on mass transfer rate during the
production process ( Garcia-Ochoa et al., 2000b ). As an example, Fig.14
shows a comparison between experimental and predicted K
Lavalues,
taking into account changes on operational conditions in time courseof batch fermentation. Fig. 14 a shows the dramatic increase of
viscosity of the broth, which enlarges ﬁlm resistance to transport,
and produces the decreasing of oxygen mass transfer coef ﬁcient, k
L;i n
consequence, an increasing of stirrer speed is necessary to maintain-ing an adequate dissolved oxygen concentration. Fig. 14 b shows a
comparison between experimental and predicted values of KLa, taking
into account all the effects above commented: change in viscosity
broth (for xanthan production) and change in the stirrer speed,
together with the evolution of other magnitudes (biomass concentra-
tion and OUR).
Using another example, in sophorolipids synthesis by yeast Can-
dida bombicola (a biosurfactant, product non-associated to growth)
the oxygen concentrations also have an important role. Fig. 15 a
shows the moderate variation of viscosity of the broth, caused by theincreasing of biomass concentration, for a constant stirrer speed of
10 s
−1. InFig. 15 b the evolution of the volumetric oxygen mass transfer,
KLa, with the biomass concentration during time course fermentation
of yeast growth and the values predicted by the model are presented.
When sophorolipids are produced and segregated into the medium ,
the surface tension decreases until the micelle critical concentration isreached. Under those conditions K
Laalso decreases reaching a value of
9.4·10−3s−1. Then, for large cell concentrations, which mean that OUR
increases, the volumetric mass transfer coef ﬁcient value also increases
because the enhancement factor increases, assuming values higherthan 1. Fig. 16 is an example of the evolution of different mass
transport parameters during the production of sophorolipids by C.
bombicola .Fig. 16 a shows the variation of the sophorolipid concentra-
tion and the surface tension in time course of fermentation and inFig. 16 b the experimental and predicted K
Lavalues are shown during
the biosurfactant production.
InRhodococcus erythropolis cultures, the growth of the bacteria is
also strongly dependent on the availability of oxygen. The dissolvedoxygen concentration is dependent on the oxygen transfer rate from
the air bubbles to the liquid and on the oxygen uptake rate for growth,
Fig. 15. Evolution of apparent viscosity and volumetric mass transfer coef ﬁcient on the
course of fermentation in growth medium of Candida bombicola (using a constant
stirrer speed of 10 s−1) (adapted from Garcia-Ochoa and Gomez, 2005 ).

cells ( Olmo et al., 2005; Gomez et al., 2006 ). In Fig. 17 a experimental
values of biodesulphurization capability of the cells under differentmass transfer conditions (due to the change in stirrer speed) versus
biomass concentration are represented; it can be seen that themaximum percentage of desulphurising capability is similar for stirrer
speeds between 250 to 400 rpm (approximately of 80% for cells grownduring 30 h). In the case of working at 150 rpm, this decrease is faster,
surely as a consequence of the oxygen transport limitation during
growth. Finally, experimental and predicted K
Lavalues, under
different operational conditions, are shown in Fig. 17 b. Again,
theoretical predicted model values for kLaand Eyield satisfactory
results when experimental and predicted values are compared.
A reasonable agreement is found between the experimental data
and the values predicted by the theoretical model described, forsparged and stirred tank bioreactors, under a wide range of operational
conditions, for different cultures of X. campestris (producing xanthan,
a polysaccharide), C. bombicola (a yeast producing a sophorolipid or
bio-surfactant) and R. erythropolis (bacteria with biodesulphurization
capability).
OTR is the most important parameter implied on the design,
operation and scale up of bioreactors. Aerobic bioprocesses involvetransport and biochemical reactions of one or more species simulta-
neously. A proper mechanical design of the bioreactor is very im-
portant to provide a controlled system where a homogeneous oxygen
concentration in the medium lets us achieve an optimal growth and/or
a product formation. In this way, aeration and agitation are important
variables in order to produce an effective oxygen transfer rate into the
medium and oxygen uptake rate must be known in order to control the
dissolved oxygen concentration. Thus, in order to have an adequate
description of bioprocesses, the knowledge of the volumetric mass
transfer coef ﬁcient value, as characteristic parameter of the OTR, is
required, taking into account the different aspects considered in thepresent review.Nomenclature
