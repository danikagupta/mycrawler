DyP-type peroxidasesIntroduction
Peroxidases (EC 1.11.1.x) represent a large family of oxidoreductases that 
typically use hydrogen peroxide as an electron acceptor to catalyze the oxidation 
of substrate molecules. The vast majority of these enzymes contain heme as 
a cofactor1 and are ubiquitously present in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. 
Peroxidases take center stage in a variety of biochemical processes, ranging 
from the biosynthesis of cell wall material to immunological host-defense 
responses.2,3 Heme-containing peroxidases were originally classified into two 
superfamilies: the plant peroxidases and the animal peroxidases.4,a Remarkably, 
some members of the peroxidase superfamily have been studied for more than 
a century like horseradish peroxidase (HRP), a prototype plant peroxidase.5 
In this respect, it was fascinating that the first member of a newly discovered 
peroxidase superfamily, the group of DyP-type peroxidases, was described in 
1999.6 In this chapter, we discuss the biochemical and structural features of DyP-
type peroxidases as well as their promising biotechnological potential.
Phylogenetic and structural comparison
Dye-decolorizing (DyP-type) peroxidases were first discovered in fungi and 
named after their ability to degrade a wide range of dyes.6 Subsequently, 
additional members were found in the proteomes of other fungi as well as 
in several bacteria.7 This indicates that these enzymes are widespread like 
other peroxidases. Interestingly, recent genome sequence analysis revealed 
that these enzymes are prominent in bacteria, whereas only a small number 
is found in fungi and higher eukaryotes. Their occurrence in archaea is even 
more limited. The most comprehensive overview of the DyP-type peroxidase 
superfamily is offered by the InterPro database.8 According to this database, the 
DyP superfamily currently (February 2018) comprises 12,670 enzymes of which 
11,877 are found in bacteria, 741 in eukaryotes, and 52 in archaea. Additionally, 
DyP-type peroxidases are, according to PeroxiBase, further sub-classified into 
the phylogenetically distinct classes A, B, C, and D.9 Alternative classifications 
a More recently heme-containing peroxidases were reclassified in four independently evolved 
superfamilies: the peroxidase-catalase superfamily, the peroxidase-cyclooxygenase superfamily, 
the peroxidase-chlorite dismutase superfamily and the peroxidase-peroxygenase superfamily.78 
The peroxidase-catalase superfamily is formed by members of the previously called ‘superfamily 
of bacterial, fungal and plant heme peroxidases’. The ‘superfamily of the animal heme-dependent 
peroxidases’ contains enzymes from all kingdoms of life and was renamed to the peroxidase-
cyclooxygenase superfamily. The peroxidase-chlorite dismutase superfamily consists of three 
protein families that share a common fold: DyP-type peroxidases, chlorite dismutases and EfeB, 
previously called the CDE-superfamily79. In this chapter the original classification will be used.10
Chapter 1with three and five classes have also been proposed.10,11 Subfamilies C and D are 
grouped together in the classification with three classes. An overview of the DyP-
type peroxidases characterized thus far is shown in Table 1 and a phylogenetic 
tree is shown in Figure 1. Many of the potential bacterial enzymes are putative 
cytoplasmic enzymes (class B and C), indicating that they are involved in 
intracellular metabolism. In contrast, enzymes belonging to class A contain a 
Tat-dependent signal sequence, which suggests that they function outside of 
the cytoplasm or extracellularly as previously confirmed by us and others.12–14 
Class D contains primarily fungal variants. For some of these peroxidases, it 
has been shown that they are involved in dye decolorization.7 Nevertheless, 
the physiological function of the majority of DyP-type peroxidases is at present 
unclear, although evidence is accumulating that some bacterial variants are 
involved in the degradation of lignin.15–19 This suggests that these enzymes can be 
regarded as the bacterial equivalents of the fungal lignin degrading peroxidases.

Chapter 1 DyP-type peroxidases are unrelated at the primary sequence level to 
peroxidases of the plant and animal superfamilies. They also lack the typical 
heme-binding motif of plant peroxidases, comprising one proximal histidine, 
one distal histidine, and one crucial arginine (Fig. 2).3,5,7 Moreover, DyP-type 
peroxidases and plant peroxidases both bind the heme cofactor non-covalently, 
unlike animal peroxidases, which bind the heme cofactor covalently (Fig. 2).52 
All DyP-type peroxidases contain the so-called GXXDG-motif in their primary 
sequence, which is part of the heme-binding region. This motif is important for 
peroxidase activity because replacement of the conserved aspartate by an alanine 
or asparagine inactivates the enzyme, while heme-binding is not affected.14,43 
Based on these results, it was proposed that the conserved aspartate of the 
GXXDG-motif is functionally similar to the distal histidine of plant peroxidases.1,3 
However, the catalytic role of this conserved aspartate was put into question by 
a recent study. It was shown that substitution of the aspartate of the GXXDG-
motif of Escherichia coli  EfeB/YcdB by an asparagine only marginally affected the 
peroxidase activity of this enzyme.23  
A limited number of fungal and bacterial DyP-type peroxidases have been 
characterized in some detail, including elucidation of their crystal structures, 
see Table 1. While DyP-type peroxidases from the different subclasses often 
exhibit a remarkable low sequence similarity, their overall structural topology 
is highly conserved. Structurally, DyP-type peroxidases comprise two domains 
that contain α-helices and anti-parallel β-sheets, unlike plant and mammalian 
peroxidases that are primarily α-helical proteins (Fig. 2).5,52 Both domains in 
DyP-type peroxidases adopt a unique ferredoxin-like fold and form an active 
site crevice with the heme cofactor sandwiched in between. The heme-binding 
motif contains a highly conserved histidine in the C-terminal domain of the 
enzyme (Fig. 2), which seems to be an important heme ligand and is therefore 
functionally similar to the proximal histidine of plant peroxidases.23,28,35,43 To test 
the role of the proximal histidine of DyP-type peroxidases as a heme ligand, we 
replaced this residue by an alanine in TfuDyP from Thermobifida fusca. This 
resulted in a loss of heme, which demonstrates that this residue is indeed an 
important heme ligand of DyP-type peroxidases.14 In addition, fungal DyP-type 
peroxidases also contain a conserved histidine in the N-terminal domain of the 
enzyme, which was previously assigned as heme ligand.53 However, this residue 
does not contribute to heme binding according to the available structures.43 
Clearly, more structural studies are required to unveil the molecular details by 
which DyP-type peroxidases catalyze oxidations.13
DyP-type peroxidasesBiochemical properties 
The biochemical properties of about forty DyP-type peroxidases of fungal and 
bacterial origin have been analyzed thus far. These enzymes are typically 50-
60 kDa, while several bacterial variants are somewhat smaller (about 40 kDa). 
All characterized DyP-type peroxidases contain non-covalently bound heme 
(protoheme IX) as cofactor.13,14,28,31,35,43 In addition, several oligomeric states have 
been reported, ranging from monomers to hexamers.6,13,14,23,28,35,38 It has been 
well established that the catalytic mechanism of plant and animal peroxidases 
proceeds via formation of compound I. This is the first (high-oxidation) 
intermediate in the reaction cycle of peroxidases and is formed by a reaction 
between H2O2 and the Fe(III) resting state of the enzyme. It is therefore generally

and human myeloperoxidase (His95 and His336) are indicated, as well as catalytically important 
residues of DyP (e.g., Asp171 and Arg329) and HRP (e.g., Arg38 and Phe41). Heme is covalently 
bound by Asp94, Glu242, and Met243 in human myeloperoxidase. PDB files used: DyP , 2D3Q; HRP , 
1ATJ; hMPO, 1CXP .14
Chapter 1assumed that this is also the case for DyP-type peroxidases. Although the 
exact details about their catalytic cycle are still unclear, several recent studies 
point towards major differences between the catalytic mechanism of DyP-type 
peroxidases and other peroxidases. Based on four novel structures of a fungal 
DyP , it was proposed that the aspartate of the GXXDG-motif functions as acid-
base catalyst and swings into a proper position that is optimal for interaction 
with H2O2.54 The aspartate catalyzes compound I formation through the 
transfer of a proton from the proximal to the distal oxygen atom of H2O2, hence 
facilitating heterolytic cleavage of the O-O bond of H2O2 (Fig. 3). Compound I, 
an oxoferryl iron with a porphyrin-based cation radical, reacts consecutively 
with two equivalents of substrate to return via compound II (Fe(IV)) back to the 
resting state of the heme (compound 0, Fe(III)). This crucial role of the conserved 
aspartate as a catalytic residue agrees well with the results of the mutagenesis 
studies on a fungal and a bacterial DyP as discussed above. However, it is in 
contrast to, for example, plant peroxidases where the distal histidine functions 
as an acid-base catalyst and compound I formation is assisted by an essential 
arginine (Fig. 2).5 Furthermore, analysis of the peroxidative cycle of DypB from 
Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 established that its conserved aspartate is not required 
for peroxidase activity because replacement of this residue by alanine had a 
marginal effect on the reactivity towards H2O2 and the formation of compound 
I. Rather, a conserved arginine of DypB was found to be essential for peroxidase 
activity.55 It therefore appears that DyP-type peroxidases employ different 
residues as acid-base catalyst(s) during their catalytic cycle.
Remarkably, DyP-type peroxidases are able to oxidize substrates that are 
too large to fit in the active site. DypB, for instance, shows saturation kinetics 
towards the large molecules of Kraft lignin.30 Long-range electron transfer 
(LRET) between the heme cofactor and the surface of DypB was suggested as a 
potential mechanism. More recently, an LRET pathway to the surface of AauDyPI 
of Auricularia auricula-judae  was identified.42,56 Residues Tyr337 and Leu357 
facilitate electron transfer from the heme cofactor of AauDyPI to the surface of 
this fungal DyP , forming a surface-exposed oxidation site that might react with 
bulky substrates. Tyr337 is conserved in fungal DyPs. A comparable, but not 
identical, long-range electron transfer pathway is present in lignin peroxidases 
(LiP) from the plant superfamily of peroxidases (Fig. 4).42,57 For instance, in LiP 
from Phanerochaete chrysosporium,  a surface-exposed tryptophan was shown 
to be the interaction site of veratryl alcohol.58
The most distinguishing feature of DyP-type peroxidases is their 
unparalleled catalytic properties. Firstly, these enzymes are active at low 
pH, which is most likely dictated by the aspartate of the GXXDG-motif that 15

reduced in two one-electron reductions back to the resting state, thereby forming two substrate 
radicals.

Chapter 1functions as an acid-base catalyst at low pH for at least a subset of DyP-type 
peroxidases.14,43 Secondly, DyP-type peroxidases exhibit a unique substrate 
acceptance profile. These enzymes are able to degrade various dyes efficiently 
and in particular anthraquinone dyes, which are poorly accepted by plant and 
animal peroxidases. Furthermore, DyP-type peroxidases display poor activity 
towards azo dyes and small non-phenolic compounds unlike plant and animal 
peroxidases.6,13,61–63,14,16,23,28,35,38,59,60 Moreover, we have relatively recently 
established that Tfu DyP is able to oxidize aromatic sulfides enantioselectively, 
similar to plant peroxidases, thereby expanding their biocatalytic scope.5,14,64,65 
Intriguingly, DyP-type peroxidases appear to be multifunctional enzymes 
displaying not only oxidative activity but also hydrolytic activity.7,48 
Biotechnological potential 
Plant peroxidases are attractive biocatalysts because of their broad substrate 
range, neutral pH optimum, and ability to catalyze reactions such as 
halogenations, epoxidations, hydroxylations, and enantioselective oxidations, 
often accompanied with good yields.66 However, the exploitation of these 
enzymes is hampered by their notoriously difficult heterologous expression and 
limited stability. With regards to the latter, it is interesting to note that DyP-
type peroxidases appear remarkable robust, as shown by us and others.14,67,68 
Furthermore, our characterization of TfuDyP showed that this enzyme is expressed 
well heterologously in E. coli.14 Combined, this shows that the bacterial enzymes 
are a promising alternative for known peroxidases of fungal origin because of 
the difficulties in fungal genetics and protein expression. The potential of DyP-
type peroxidases as useful biocatalysts for industrial applications is further 
emphasized by their ability to degrade a variety of synthetic dyes, indicating that 
these enzymes can be used for the bioremediation of dye-contaminated waste 
water. Moreover, several recent studies showed that DyP-type peroxidases 
are involved in the biodegradation of lignocellulosic material, which is highly 
resistant to (bio)chemical degradation. For example, DypB from Rhodococcus 
jostii  RHA 1 showed activity towards polymeric lignin as well as lignin model 
compounds.16 Additionally, the hydrolytic degradation of wheat straw was 
increased by external addition of DyP from Irpex lacteus.47 Together, these 
studies show that DyP-type peroxidases act as ligninolytic enzymes, thereby 
pointing towards a major role of these enzymes in the microbial degradation of 
lignin.19,69 Moreover, it was reported that two fungal DyP-type peroxidases are 
able to degrade β-carotene.48 The degradation of β-carotene is of interest for the 
food industry, enabling the enzymatic whitening of whey-containing foods and 
beverages. This specific application was patented and the respective fungal DyP-17
DyP-type peroxidasestype peroxidase is marketed under the name MaxiBright by DSM. The discovery 
of novel antimicrobial targets has become a pressing matter due to the vast 
increase of antibiotic-resistant, pathogenic bacteria.70 With regards to this issue, 
it is important to emphasize that, as noted earlier, DyP-type peroxidases are 
remarkably abundant in the proteomes of bacteria, including many pathogenic 
bacteria, while these enzymes are absent in mammals. This indicates that DyP-
type peroxidases could be promising, novel anti-microbial (pro)drug targets. This 
notion is supported by a recent study that showed that a DyP-type peroxidase 
from Pseudomonas fluorescens GcM5-1A is toxic to cells of the Japanese black 
pine.71
Conclusions  
The group of DyP-type peroxidases comprises a newly identified superfamily 
of peroxidases, which are unrelated in sequence and structure to well-known 
peroxidases belonging to the plant or animal superfamilies. DyP-type peroxidases 
exhibit unique reaction features by displaying novel substrate specificities 
and reactivities. Additionally, DyP-type peroxidases can be remarkably robust 
and combined this unveils their potential use as biocatalysts in a variety of 
biotechnological applications. However, these enzymes are only active under 
acidic conditions, which severely restrict their number of applications. It is 
therefore desirable to alter their pH optimum by enzyme redesign to broaden 
their applicability. Despite the promising biocatalytic potential of DyP-type 
peroxidases, much more work is needed to fully characterize the catalytic 
mechanism of DyP-type peroxidases, their heme biochemistry, as well as the 
exact role of the catalytic residues and in particular the function of the conserved 
aspartate. Additional high-resolution structures of DyP-type peroxidases from all 
the various subclasses are therefore required, preferably in combination with 
different ligands. The limited number of DyP-type peroxidases characterized so 
far has established that these enzymes exhibit a vastly different substrate scope 
than plant and animal peroxidases, using, however, a restricted set of diagnostic 
substrates. It is therefore desirable that more and diverse substrates should be 
tested in order to fully understand their biocatalytic scope. Lastly, future studies 
should be aimed at investigating the potential of DyP-type peroxidases in the 
biodegradation of lignocellulosic material and as novel microbial (pro)drug 
targets. In conclusion, it can be expected that the growing number of DyP-type 
peroxidases biochemically and structurally characterized will fully delineate their 
biotechnological potential. This will also provide new leads for the construction 
of improved variants suitable for biotechnological applications.18
Chapter 1Aim and outline of the thesis
The research in this thesis was financed by the Netherlands Organization for 
Scientific Research (NWO) under the graduate program: synthetic biology for 
advanced metabolic engineering, project number 022.004.006.
The aim of the research presented in this thesis was to broaden the 
knowledge on class A DyP-type peroxidases. Two DyPs were selected and 
used as model enzymes: TfuDyP from Thermobifida fusca YX and SviDyP 
from Saccharomonospora viridis  DSM 43017.14,24 TfuDyP was isolated and 
characterized by van Bloois et al as a thermostable, Tat-dependently secreted 
peroxidase which was easily overexpressed in Escherichia coli . The substrate 
scope of this enzyme covers dyes and monophenolic compounds while it also 
shows peroxygenase activity in the enantioselective sulfoxidation of aromatic 
sulfides. SviDyP is homologous to TfuDyP (42% sequence identity) and has the 
advantage over TfuDyP that it is active at a slightly higher pH range. 
DyP-type peroxidases are named after their ability to degraded recalcitrant 
dyes.6 Previous studies focused predominantly on anthraquinone and azo 
dyes.6,20,38 To study the biotechnological potential of DyP-type peroxidases 
further, an extensive substrate profiling study was performed with TfuDyP as 
model enzyme. Chapter 2 presents the activity of TfuDyP on thirty dyes from 
seven distinct classes, three natural carotenoids and various lignin model 
compounds. 
For their activity DyP-type peroxidases rely on a tightly bound heme 
cofactor. On the proximal side of the heme a histidine functions as the fifth 
ligand of the heme iron, while on the distal side two catalytically important 
residues are found: an aspartate and an arginine. The oxidation site(s) of small 
and large substrates are presumably different and not fully understood. Some 
small compounds are known to enter the heme pocket and react with the heme 
cofactor directly. Large compounds, e.g. bulky dyes and lignin model compounds, 
are however too large to enter the active site. Chapter 3 describes a mutagenesis 
study on TfuDyP with the aim to identify more catalytically important residues 
or residues that determine the pH optimum of the enzyme. This chapter 
presents the effect of mutations in the heme pocket, in the predicted hydrogen 
peroxide tunnel and close to the surface exposed heme propionate. Some (DyP-
type) peroxidases depend on long-range electron transfer for the activity of 
substrates that are too large to enter the active site. To explore whether TfuDyP 
is dependent on such a mechanism, mutagenesis was performed on the surface 
exposed tyrosines and tryptophans. For the biotechnological applicability of 
DyP-type peroxidases, it would be beneficial to shift the pH optimum for activity 19
DyP-type peroxidasesto a more neutral pH range. Mutations that were proven beneficial in shifting the 
pH optimum of PpDyP and BsDyP were studied in TfuDyP .72,73
For the industrial applicability of DyP-type peroxidases a high protein 
overexpression level is desired. Many DyP-type peroxidases are from bacterial 
origin and are therefore relatively easily heterologously overexpressed in a 
bacterial host. This is in stark contrast to peroxidases from eukaryotes. Even 
though TfuDyP originates from T. fusca and is easily overexpressed in E. coli,  
increasing the overexpression level to 200 mg per liter culture broth led to 
an almost inactive enzyme. Chapter 4 discusses the correlation between the 
activity of TfuDyP and the expression level in E. coli . Analysis of the protein by 
UV-vis absorbance spectroscopy and high-resolution mass spectroscopy on the 
extracted heme cofactor revealed the reason for the inactivity of the enzyme.
Most enzymes in nature are involved in metabolic pathways in which 
the product of one enzyme is the substrate of another enzyme. In some cases 
this even led to the fusion of enzymes to bi/multifunctional protein complexes. 
Peroxidases and oxidases form catalytically logical combinations and are often 
coexpressed in nature: peroxidases require hydrogen peroxide for their activity, a 
by-product of the oxidases. Chapter 5 describes the first successful recombinant 
expression of artificial oxidase-peroxidase fusion enzymes. We fused SviDyP 
to four distinct oxidases: alditol oxidase (HotAldO), chitooligosaccharide 
oxidase (ChitO), eugenol oxidase (EugO) and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural oxidase 
(HMFO).74–77 Special attention was paid to exploring the potential applicability 
of the designed oxidase-peroxidase fusions. Two fusion enzymes were used in 
one-pot two-step cascade reactions while the other two fusion enzymes could 
be applied as biosensor for the detection of various sugars. 20
