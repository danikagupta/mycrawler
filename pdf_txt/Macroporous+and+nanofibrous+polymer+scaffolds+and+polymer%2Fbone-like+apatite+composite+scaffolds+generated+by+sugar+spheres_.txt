Abstract: Scaffolds are crucial to tissue engineering/re-
generation. In this work, a technique combining a unique
phase-separation process with a novel sugar sphere tem-plate leaching process has been developed to produce three-dimensional scaffolds. The resulting scaffolds possess highporosities, well connected macropores, and nanoﬁbrouspore walls. The technique advantageously controls macro-pore shape and size by sugar spheres, interpore opening sizeby assembly conditions (time and temperature of heat treat-
ment), and pore wall morphology by phase-separation pa-
rameters. The bioactivity of a macroporous and nanoﬁbrouspoly( l-lactic acid) (PLLA) scaffold was demonstrated by the
bone-like apatite deposition throughout the scaffold in asimulated body ﬂuid (SBF). Preincorporation of nanosizedhydroxyapatite eliminated the induction period and facili-tated the apatite growth in the SBF. Interestingly, the apatitegrowth primarily occurred on the surface of the pores (in-ternal and external) but not the interior of the nanoﬁbrous
network away from the pore surface. It was also noticed thatthe macropore size did not affect the apatite growth rate,while the interpore opening size did. The compressive mod-ulus also increased substantially when a continuous apatitelayer was formed on the pore walls of the scaffold. Theresulting composite scaffold mimics natural bone matrixwith the combination of an organic phase (a polymer such as
PLLA) and an inorganic apatite phase. The demonstrated
bioactivity of apatite layer, together with well-controlledmacroporous and nanoﬁbrous structures, makes the novelnanocomposite scaffolds desirable for bone tissue engineer-ing. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res 78A:306 –315, 2006

INTRODUCTION
Strategies for bone tissue engineering are generally
based on either the implantation of a porous scaffoldto harness the natural progression of osseous growthor the seeding of osteogenic cells onto a three-dimen-sional (3D) scaffold followed by in vivo implantation to
repair bone defects. In both cases, the scaffold servesas a temporary physical support and template forinitial cell attachment, and it provides a microenviron-ment appropriate for further osteogenesis.
1,2The de-
velopment of appropriate 3D scaffolds for the main-tenance of cellular viability and phenotype is criticaland has been a challenge in the ﬁeld of tissue engi-neering.
3– 6Scaffold materials must meet certain phys-
ical and biological criteria for tissue engineering ap-plications. In terms of physical properties, an idealscaffold should have three-dimensionally well-con-
nected macropore structure to accommodate cells andto facilitate cell migration, proliferation, and differen-tiation, thereby ensuring functional neotissue forma-tion. Consequently, scaffolds with high porosity andinterconnected pore structures generally favor tissueregeneration.
7,8
The surface morphology has been demonstrated to
play a signiﬁcant role in regulating cell activities suchas attachment, proliferation, and/or differentiation.
9,10
Polymeric scaffolds with a nanoﬁbrous pore wall ar-chitecture improved initial osteoblastic cell attach-ment (24 h) as compared to those with relativelysmooth pore walls, possibly due to the selective ad-sorption of ﬁbronectin and vitronectin on a nanoﬁ-brous scaffold.

In previous studies, we used parafﬁn spheres to
fabricate porous scaffolds. The main advantage of us-ing parafﬁn spheres as a porogen (pore-generatingmaterial) is that, unlike other porogens (such as so-Correspondence to: P. X. Ma; e-mail: mapx@umich.edu

dium chloride crystals), they can be heat treated to
form a bound template, thus creating interconnectedpore openings in the ﬁnal scaffolds. However, thereare also some disadvantages of using parafﬁn spheres
because many organic solvents such as tetrahydrofu-ran (THF), dioxane, dichloromethane, and pyridine

grees of solubility to parafﬁn. Therefore, parafﬁnspheres are not an ideal porogen for these systems. Inaddition, trace amount of parafﬁn could be left in thescaffolds, which could be unfavorable for the subse-quent cell activity due to its hydrophobicity. In thiswork, we developed alternative sugar spheres to pre-pare 3D macroporous and nanoﬁbrous scaffolds. Suchscaffolds retained the advantages of interconnectedspherical pores while avoiding the use of parafﬁn.Sugar is water soluble, allows removal without usingorganic solvents, and is suitable for the fabrication ofscaffolds from any water insoluble polymers.
Because hydroxyapatite (HAP) is the major mineral
phase in natural bone, coating a thin layer of HAPonto a metallic or polymeric material surface has beenutilized to induce faster biological ﬁxation of implantsto host bone tissue.
11,12For bone tissue engineering,
the scaffold should also provide desired osteoconduc-
tivity13,14and mechanical properties.15–17The bioac -
tivity of the new scaffold was demonstrated using in
vitro bone-like apatite particle growth in a simulated
body ﬂuid (SBF). The apatite growth on the nanoﬁ-brous scaffolds also improved the mechanical proper-ties. Therefore, the resulting novel polymer/apatitecomposite scaffolds should be advantageous for bonetissue engineering.

were from Fisher Scientiﬁc (Pittsburgh, PA). THF and allother chemicals were from Aldrich Chemical Company(Milwaukee, WI).
Preparation of sugar spheres
Sugar spheres with different sizes were prepared by an
emulsion technique. Typically, 50 g of d-fructose were
melted at 120°C for 90 min until clear yellowish liquid wasobtained. The liqueﬁed sugar was emulsiﬁed into 50 mLmineral oil with 1.3 mL Span 80 at 120°C under stirring. The
resulting mixture was cooled down using an ice-bath to
solidify sugar spheres. After discarding the mineral oil, thesugar spheres were washed with hexane three times andsieved to select desired sizes (180 –250, 250 – 425, and 425–600/H9262m size ranges). The sieved sugar spheres were packed
in a Teﬂon vial with hexane and heat treated for a certaintime period to form a sugar sphere template. After bondingthe sugar spheres, hexane was removed, and the sugartemplate was dried under vacuum.Polymer casting and phase separation
The phase separation procedure for fabrication of porous
scaffold was modiﬁed from Ma and Zhang.4,18Brieﬂy, about
0.6 – 0.8 mL 10% PLLA/THF solution or PLLA/nHAP/THF
suspension was cast into the assembled sugar template.Mild vacuum was applied during casting in order to fully ﬁllthe interspaces of the bonded sugar template with polymer
solution. The polymer solution/sugar template was phase
separated at /H1100220°C overnight and then immersed into cy-
clohexane to extract solvent (THF) for 2 days. The resultingcomposites were freeze-dried. The sugar template was thenleached away in distilled water, and the highly porous nano-
ﬁbrous scaffold was freeze-dried.
Bone-like apatite deposition
Prefabricated nanoﬁbrous scaffolds were incubated in a
1.5/H11003SBF with a modiﬁed formulation that was prepared by
dissolving NaCl, NaHCO3, KCl, K2HPO4/H185283H2O, MgCl2/H185286H2O,

were 1.5 times those of human blood plasma. The SBF
solution was changed every other day. After incubation at37°C for a designated time period, scaffolds were removed
from SBF, rinsed with distilled water twice overnight, and
vacuum dried.
Morphological characterization
The porous morphologies of the scaffolds were examined
with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Hitachi S-3200Nand Philips XL30 FEG) at 15–20 kV. The samples were cut by
a razor blade or fractured after liquid nitrogen treatment
and coated with gold for 150 s using a sputter coater (Desk-II, Denton Vacuum). Overall porosity was calculated usingthe method described by Wei and Ma.
15Interpore opening
size and interpore opening ratio (IOR) were determined
from SEM images according to Chen and Ma.19IOR is
deﬁned as the ratio of interpore opening area to macropore
surface area in a scaffold. At least 30 pores in a few repre-sentative SEM images were analyzed. For energy-dispersivespectroscopy (EDS), scaffold samples without gold coating
were used to characterize the composition of apatite parti-cles under an environmental mode.
Surface area measurement
The speciﬁc surface area ( ABET) measurement was per -
formed on nanoﬁbrous PLLA scaffolds using a BELSORP-mini apparatus (BEL Japan). Adsorption/desorption iso-
therms of samples were obtained using nitrogen as the
adsorbate and liquid nitrogen as cooling medium. Surfacearea of nanoﬁbrous scaffolds was calculated from Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) plot of adsorption/desorption iso-therm using adsorption points in the P/P
0range of 0.1– 0.3
(BELSORP-mini analysis software).
Mechanical test
The compressive mechanical properties of the scaffolds
were measured using a MTS Synergie 200 mechanical tester(MTS systems, Eden Prairie, Minnesota). Scaffolds with di-
mensions of 17.5 /H110060.5 mm in diameter and 3 mm in thick-
ness were used. Five specimens were tested for each sample.The compressive modulus was deﬁned as the initial linearmodulus on the stress–strain curves. A two-tail Student’st-test (unequal variances) was performed to determine the
statistical signiﬁcance ( p/H110210.05) of the differences in me-
chanical properties.
RESULTS
Morphological properties
Macroporous and nanoﬁbrous scaffolds have been
prepared using sugar template leaching and phase-separation techniques following the steps depicted inFigure 1(a– d). Figure 1(e,f) show the typical morphol-ogy of scaffolds prepared using sugar spheres with adiameter of 250 – 425 /H9262m (PLLA250) and heat treated
at 37°C for 15 min. The scaffold has macropores 250 –425/H9262m in diameter, an average interpore opening size
of 116/H9262m, and nanoﬁbers with an average diameter in
the order of 100 nm. By varying sugar sphere size andassembly conditions (heat treatment temperature andtime), one can easily control the macropore size, theinterpore opening size, and interpore opening arearatio (Table 1). Figure 2 shows the morphology ofscaffolds with different macropore sizes. Under thesame assembly conditions (37°C for 15 min), the re-sulting scaffolds have the same high porosity of 98%despite the differences in macropore size. With thesame IOR of about 20%, the average interpore openingsizes are substantially different, varying from 71 /H9262m

to 158 /H9262m for scaffolds prepared with 425– 600 /H9262m
sugar spheres. The IOR is controlled by the sugarsphere assembling conditions, mainly the heat treat-ment temperature and time (Fig. 3). The IORs of 4.8%and 29.1% are achieved for PLLA scaffolds without
heat treatment and with heat treatment at 57°C for 15min, respectively (Table 1).
Macroporous and nanoﬁbrous PLLA scaffold has a
very high surface area of 90 –110 m
2/g, regardless of
the macropore sizes and IORs. The nanoﬁbrous struc-
ture contributes substantially to the large surface areaof the scaffold because the nonnano-ﬁbrous equivalent(scaffold with similar macroporous structure but with-out nanoﬁbrous networks) has a surface area lowerthan 0.1 m
2/g (data not shown).Mechanical properties
For the measurement of mechanical properties, all
nanoﬁbrous PLLA scaffolds have a similar porosity ofabout 98%. The mechanical properties are examinedagainst macropore size [Fig. 4(a)] and IOR of the scaf-folds [Fig. 4(b)]. The difference in compressive mod-ulus between scaffolds with different macropore sizesis not statistically signiﬁcant ( p/H110220.05), although scaf-
folds with smaller macropore size (180 –250 /H9262m) show
a slightly higher compressive modulus than scaffoldswith larger macropore sizes (250 – 425 /H9262m or 425– 600
/H9262m) [Fig. 4(a)]. A larger IOR results in a lower com-
pressive modulus [Fig. 4(b)].

folds is evaluated using SEM, EDS, mechanical prop-

time. Figure 5 shows SEM micrographs of apatitegrowth on PLLA nanoﬁbrous scaffolds after varyingtimes of incubation in SBF. Substantial amounts ofbone-like apatite crystals are formed on nanoﬁbrousPLLA scaffolds after 6 days of incubation in SBF [Fig.5(c)]. The deposited apatite particles grow into a fewhundred nanometers in size and have nanostructuredsurface features. The underlying nanoﬁbers becomehardly observable after 15 days of incubation. Furtherincubation in the SBF leads to a continuous apatitelayer formation, covering all inner pore wall surfaces[Fig. 5(e– h)]. The interconnected macroporous struc-ture of the scaffolds is maintained, which is importantfor cell migration and mass transport when used fortissue regeneration. There is not appreciable apatiteformation in the bulk of nanoﬁber network away frommacropore wall surfaces [Fig. 5(g)]. The macroporesize (from 180 –250 /H9262m, 250 – 425 /H9262m to 425– 600 /H9262m)
of the scaffold does not have signiﬁcant effect on therate and amount of apatite deposition (data notshown). However, the interpore opening size and IOR
affect the apatite growth on scaffolds at long incuba-tion times. Scaffolds with larger interpore openings(158/H9262m) and higher IOR (24%) allow signiﬁcantly
more apatite deposition than those with smaller inter-pore openings (58 /H9262m) and lower IOR (4%) (Fig. 6).
Signiﬁcantly higher compressive modulus is observedfor composite scaffold when apatite particles become acontinuous layer covering the entire pore wall sur-faces after 15 days or longer incubation times in SBF(Fig. 7).
Preincorporation of nHAP particles in polymer scaf-
folds (even at a low content of 10 w/w%) inducesgreater amounts of apatite formation in SBF as com-pared to pure polymer scaffolds (Fig. 8). Substantialamounts of apatite crystals are grown on PLLA/nHAP composite scaffolds after 4 days of incubationin SBF [Fig. 9(a,b)]. At this time, there is a negligibleamount of apatite formation on pure polymer scaf-folds [Fig. 5(a,b)]. This is also conﬁrmed by EDS spec-tra (Fig. 10). There are signiﬁcant increases of Ca and

How-ever, the Ca and P elements are not detectable for purePLLA scaffolds after 4 days of incubation in the SBF.The size and morphology of apatite particles onPLLA/nHAP nanocomposite scaffolds (Fig. 9) are dif-ferent from those on pure PLLA scaffolds (Fig. 5). Theapatite particle size increases from 0.8 –1 /H9262m at day 4
to 2–2.5 /H9262m at day 30 for PLLA/nHAP scaffolds while
the apatite particles on PLLA scaffolds are less than 1/H9262m in diameter after 30 days of incubation.
DISCUSSION
To achieve the ultimate goal of tissue engineering,
generating clinically useful tissue and organ replace-ment, great efforts have been made in scaffold designsto regulate cell behavior including attachment, migra-
tion, proliferation, and differentiation on a scaffold.
9,13
A tissue engineering scaffold should have high poros-ity, suitable macropore size, well-controlled interporeopenings, appropriate surface morphologies, and suit-able mechanical properties as well as bioactivity. Sev-eral techniques have been developed to fabricate 3Dporous scaffolds.
3,5,20However, there is still a limited
capacity of controlling scaffold structural features and
functions. We have presented in this work, a phaseseparation and sugar sphere leaching technique toprepare highly porous 3D scaffold with good mechan-ical properties, controlled pore geometries, and ananoﬁbrous pore wall surface morphology. In thisscaffold system, macropores and interpore openingsare designed to facilitate initial cell seeding and masstransfer during in vitro cell culture, and nanoﬁbrous
pore wall structures for better cell attachment, prolif-eration, and differentiation functions. The insufﬁcientinterconnected macroporosity of certain scaffolds hasbeen shown to limit cell colonization to the very su-perﬁcial layer ( /H11011240/H9262m from surface of a 1.9 mm-
thick scaffold).
6The presence of interpore openings,
therefore, is considered to be essential for cellular
activities,2including uniform cell seeding throughout
the scaffold in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo . The
newly developed technique can be employed to fab-ricate a variety of polymers into 3D scaffolds with ahigh porosity and well-controlled macropores and in-terpore openings.
An attractive feature of the technique is that nano-
ﬁbrous structure has been incorporated into macro-pore walls of the 3D PLLA scaffolds [Fig. 1(f)]. Thedensity of the nanoﬁbers can be modulated by phase-separation parameters such as polymer solution con-centration and phase-separation temperature. Thenanoﬁbrous structure, which mimics the main naturalbone extracellular matrix (ECM) component (collagen)in size, has been demonstrated to improve cell attach-ment
9and proliferation.21The combination of inter -
connected macroporous and nanoﬁbrous features in a3D scaffold would provide a better environment forcell growth and differentiation.
To be effectively used for bone tissue regeneration,
it is beneﬁcial that a scaffold promotes bone-like apa-tite formation when in contact with physiologicalﬂuid. To evaluate the bioactivity of the novel macro-porous and nanoﬁbrous PLLA scaffolds developed inthis study, we have investigated their ability to formbone-like apatite in a SBF. Apatite particles were de-posited uniformly throughout the macroporous andnanoﬁbrous PLLA scaffolds. With increasing incuba-tion time, the density of the apatite layer increased.Noting very uniform growth of apatite layers through-out the macroporous and nanoﬁbrous PLLA scaffoldsbut not on the scaffolds without the nanofeatures,
16,22
it is likely that the physical and surface characteristics

Journal of Biomedical Materials Research Part A DOI 10.1002/jbm.aof the scaffold (macropores, interpore openings, and
nanotopography) affect the formation kinetics andmorphology of apatite layers.
22The preincorporation
of nHAP greatly altered the apatite growth proﬁle; it
eliminated an induction time for stable nuclei forma-tion and accelerated apatite growth. It also led togreater mass increase and larger apatite particle size,which may be attributed to the increased ionic avail-ability, possibly due to the lower number of nuclei(preincorporated nHAP) in PLLA/nHAP scaffolds.
Plasma spraying process, a most commonly used
conventional HAP-coating technique,
23is not appro -
priate for biodegradable 3D scaffold because of heatgeneration during the process and its inability to coverthe entire surfaces of the deep internal pores becauseof the nature of the process. Furthermore, possibleovercoating on the surface of the porous structurewith HAP generally alters the morphology of thepores by blocking the macropores and interpore open-ings. In this study, we have developed two differentmethods to fabricate nanoﬁbrous PLLA/nHAP (directmixing) or PLLA/apatite (biomimetic coating fromSBF) nanocomposite scaffolds. The biomimeticmethod created a macroporous PLLA/apatite nano-composite scaffold with preserved open macroporousstructure and improved mechanical properties. In ad-dition, the biomimetic PLLA/apatite nanocompositescaffold provides an environment that mimics the nat-ural bone matrix more closely (with polymer nanoﬁ-bers and apatite nanocrystals) and may enhance bonetissue regeneration.
CONCLUSIONS
Macroporous and nanoﬁbrous PLLA scaffolds are
prepared by a novel phase separation and sugar
sphere template leaching technique. The combined
technique has shown great control over macroporesize, interpore opening size, as well as pore wall mor-phologies of 3D scaffolds. Bone-like apatite layer hasgrown uniformly throughout 3D nanoﬁbrous scaffoldafter SBF incubation, which has not only demon-strated the bioactivity of the macroporous and nano-ﬁbrous scaffold but has also provided a method togenerate biomimetic surfaces. The resulting scaffoldsshould have better osteoconductivity and improvedmechanical properties for bone tissue engineering ap-plications.
