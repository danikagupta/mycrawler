Abstract
Agrobacterium radiobacter MTCC 8161 completely decolorized the Crystal Violet with 8 hr (10 mg /L) at static anoxic conditions.
The decreased decolorization capability by A. radiobacter was observed, when the Crystal Violet concentration was increased
from 10 to 100 mg /L. Semi-synthetic medium containing 1% yeast extract and 0.1% NH 4Cl has shown 100% decolorization of
Crystal Violet within 5 hr. A complete degradation of Crystal Violet by A. radiobacter was observed up to 7 cycles of repeated
addition (10 mg/L). When the eﬀect of increasing inoculum concentration on decolorization of Crystal Violet (100 mg /L) was
studied, maximum decolorization was observed with 15% inoculum concentration. A signiﬁcant increase in the activities of laccase
(184%) and aminopyrine N-demethylase (300%) in cells obtained after decolorization indicated the involvement of these enzymes
in decolorization process. The intermediates formed during the degradation of Crystal Violet were analyzed by gas chromatographyand mass spectroscopy (GC/MS). It was detected the presence of N,N,N
/prime,N/prime/prime-tetramethylpararosaniline, [ N,N-dimethylaminophenyl]
[N-methylaminophenyl] benzophenone, N,N-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde, 4-methyl amino phenol and phenol. We proposed the
hypothetical metabolic pathway of Crystal Violet biodegradation by A. radiobacter. Phytotoxicity and microbial toxicity study showed
that Crystal Violet biodegradation metabolites were less toxic to bacteria ( A. radiobacter, P . aurugenosa andA. vinelandii) contributing
to soil fertility and for four kinds of plants ( Sorghum bicolor, Vigna radiata, Lens culinaris and Triticum aestivum) which are most
sensitive, fast growing and commonly used in Indian agriculture.

Introduction
Large amounts of chemically diﬀerent group of dyes
such as azo, disperse, acidic, basic, triphenylmethane were
used for textile dyeing. Signiﬁcant proportions of these
dyes enter in the environment as wastewater. Discharge
of colored textile eﬄuents into rivers and lakes results in
reduced dissolved oxygen concentration and creates toxic
conditions to aquatic ﬂora and fauna (Gill et al., 2002;
Liu et al., 2004). Among many classes of synthetic dyes
used in the textile and dyeing industries, triphenylmethane
dyes are the largest and most versatile, and play a predom-
inant role in various industrial applications (Azmi et al.,
1998). The triphenyl methane dye, Crystal Violet has been
extensively used in human and veterinary medicine as a
biological stain and as a textile dye in textile processing
industry (Au et al., 1978; Azmi et al., 1998). Crystal

in the environment for longer period. It is toxic to aquatic
and terrestrial life (Au et al., 1978; Azmi et al., 1998).
Investigations on Crystal Violet in vitro concluded that
this dye was a mitotic poisoning agent. In addition in vivo
studies proved that, Crystal Violet should be regarded as a
biohazard substance. Crystal Violet is a potent clastogenes,
which is responsible for promoting tumor growth in some
species of ﬁsh and also known as potent carcinogenic (Au
et al., 1978; Fan et al., 2009).
Currently, various chemical and physical treatment
methods including adsorption, chemical precipitation and
ﬂocculation, oxidation by chlorine, hydrogen peroxide and
ozone, electrolysis, reduction, electrochemical treatment,
and ion-pair extraction were used to remove the dye (Azmi
et al., 1998; Cheng et al., 2008; Minero et al., 2008; Fan
et al., 2009). Because of the high cost, disposal problems
and generation of toxic products most of the chemical andphysical methods for treating dye waste are not widelyNo. 8 Biodegradation of Crystal Violet by Agrobacterium radiobacter 1385
applied in the textile industries. Physio-chemical methods
of dye removal are eﬀective only if the e ﬄuent volume
is small and sometimes the degradation products are toxic(Robinson et al., 2001).
Bacterial decolorization is associated with involvement
of various enzymes such as lignin peroxidase, laccase,
azoreductase and biotransformation enzymes (Telke et al.,
2008; Parshetti et al., 2010). Decolorization of Crystal
Violet by water borne pathogenic mycobacteria is mainly
due to membrane bound fraction (Jones and Falkinham,
2003). El-Naggar et al. (2004) reported the biodegradation
of Crystal Violet using air bubble bioreactor packed with
Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, most of the studies
were carried out with Crystal Violet and a few researches
have reported the degradation mechanisms or pathways
underlying the decolorization of this triphenylmethane
dye, with fewer reporting on enzyme actions (McDonald
and Cerniglia, 1984; Bumpus and Brock, 1988; Sani and
Banerjee, 1999; Hayase et al., 2000; Chen et al., 2008;
Moturi and Singaracharya, 2009).
Genus Agrobacterium is a recognized group of phy-
topathogenic bacteria, particularly with A. radiobacter and
A. tumefaciens. A. radiobacter lacks the tumorigenic Ti
plasmid that is present in A. tumefaciens and is thus non-
phytopathogenic. It has been reported that some bacteriain genus Agrobacterium could degrade xenobiotics such
as atrazine (Struthers et al., 1998), quinoline-4-carboxylicacid (Schmidt et al., 1991), 4-aminobenzenesulfonate(Singh et al., 2006), phenanthrene (Aitken et al., 1998)
and phenol (Baek et al., 2003). There have been reports on
the isolation of Agrobacterium sp. from activated sludge
treating domestic and industrial wastewaters (Lauﬀ et al.,
1993; Dangmann et al., 1996; White et al., 1996), and
strains of A. radiobacter appear to be the most frequently
reported ones (Drysdale et al., 1999; Singh et al., 2004).
V arious organic and inorganic compounds enhanced the
decolorization rate of bacteria by acting as electron donoror stabilizing the enzymes involved in decolorization of
textile dyes (Telke et al., 2009). Therefore, it would be a
meaningful and helpful work to study the decolorization
of triphenyl methane dyes in the presence of various
organic and inorganic compounds. Thus, the objectives
of the present study were to investigate the ability of A.
radiobacter to degrade Crystal Violet and to elucidate the
possible degradation mechanism of Crystal Violet with
enzyme system involved. V arious operational parameters
were optimized for maximal decolorization of Crystal
Violet. The intermediates formed during the degradation of
Crystal Violet were analyzed by gas chromatography and
mass spectroscopy (GC /MS).
1 Experimental
1.1 Microorganisms and culture conditions
The pure culture of bacterium Agrobacterium radiobac-
ter MTCC 8161 was obtained from Microbial Type
Culture Collection (MTCC), Institute of Microbial Tech-
nology, Chandigarh, India. Pure culture was maintained
on nutrient agar and stored at 4°C. The nutrient brothcontaining (g/L) beef extract, 1; yeast extract, 2; peptone,
5; NaCl, 5; was used for decolorization experiment.
1.2 Dyes, chemicals and microbiological media
ABTS (2,2-Azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazolin-6-sulfonic
acid) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Mumbai, India).
Yeast extract and glucose were obtained from Hi Media
Laboratory (Mumbai, India). Catechol, n-propanol, and
other ﬁne chemicals were purchased from Sisco ResearchLaboratories (India). Crystal Violet was obtained from
S.D. Fine Chemicals Limited (Biosar, India). All chemi-
cals were of the highest purity and of an analytical grade.
1.3 Decolorization experiments
A loopful of microbial culture (105 CFU/mL, deter-
mined from Direct Microscopic Counts) was inoculated
in 250 mL Erlenmeyer ﬂask containing 100 mL nutrient
broth and incubated at 30°C for 24 hr. Crystal Violet was
added at a concentration of 10 mg/L after 24 hr, and 3
mL of the culture media was withdrawn at diﬀerent time
intervals. The aliquot was centrifuged at 5000 r/min for 20
min to separate the bacterial cell mass. The clear super-
natant was used to determine decolorization by measuring
the change in absorbance of culture supernatants at the
maximum absorption wavelength ( λ
max) of Crystal Violet
(580 nm). Decolorization performance of Crystal Violetwas measured under static conditions. Decolorization at
diﬀerent initial concentrations of Crystal Violet (10–100mg/L) and eﬀ ect of increasing inoculums percentage on
decolorization of Crystal Violet were tested at 30°C in thenutrient broth. Studies on the eﬀect of diﬀerent culture
conditions were carried out in synthetic medium (dye
concentration 10 mg/L) at 30°C using 10% inoculum of
optical density 1.0 (620 nm). To study the eﬀect of carbon
and nitrogen sources on degradation of Crystal Violet,
semi-synthetic medium having following composition was
used (g/L): Crystal Violet 0.010; (NH
4)2SO 40.28; NH 4Cl
0.23; KH 2PO 40.067; MgSO 4·7H 2O 0.04; CaCl 2·2H 2O
0.022; FeCl 3·6H 2O 0.005; yeast extract 0.2; NaCl 0.15;
NaHCO 31.0; and 1 mL/L of a trace element solution
containing (g/L) ZnSO 4·7H 2O 0.01; MnCl 2·4H 2O 0.1;
CuSO 4·5H 2O 0.392; CoCl 2·6H 2O 0.248; NaB 4O7·10H 2O
0.177; NiCl 2·6H 2O 0.02 with diﬀerent carbon (glucose,
lactose, molasses, sucrose) and nitrogen (peptone, yeastextract, malt extract, urea, NH
4Cl) sources. Further decol-
orization of repeated addition of dye (10 mg/L) aliquots toculture media was also studied in nutrient broth at static
conditions.
The percentage of decolorization was measured at
diﬀerent time intervals. All decolorization experiments
were performed in triplicates. Abiotic controls (without
microorganisms) were always included. Percentage of
decolorization ( D, %) was calculated by using a procedure
reported earlier (Parshetti et al., 2010).
