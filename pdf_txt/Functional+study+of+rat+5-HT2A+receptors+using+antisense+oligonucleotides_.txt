  Abstract  
Objective  
Evaluate whether postictal generalized EEG suppression (PGES) duration correlates to  5HT1A and 5HT2A 
receptor  protein  expression and RNAseq data from resected hippocampus and temporal cortex of temporal 
lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients  who had seizures recorded as part of their preoperative evaluation.  
Methods  
5HT1A and 5HT2A receptor protein w as evaluated in whole brain homogenate by western blot and 
histologically  in the hippocampus (n=16) and temporal cortex (n=9) of TLE patients with PGES (range 0 to 93 
seconds) . We correlated our  previous RNAseq  dataset  for serotonin receptors and signaling p athways by  
weighted  gene correlation network analysis  (WGCNA)  in these patients by PGES duration . 
Results  
In hippocampus , 5HT2A protein expression positive ly correlated  with PGES duration (p=0.0024, R2=0.52)  but 
5HT1A did not (p=0.87, R2=0.0020)  by western blot . In temporal cortex, 5HT1A and 5HT2A w ere expressed  at 
lower level s than in hippocampus , and they did not correlat e with PGES  duration . Histologically , PGES 
duration did not correlate with  5HT1A or 5HT2A  in hippocampal CA4, dentate gyrus, and temporal cortex.  
RNAseq identified two serotonin receptors with expression that correlated to PGES  duration  in an exploratory 
analysis : HTR3B  negative ly correlat ed (p=0.043, R2=0.26) and HTR4  positive ly correlat ed (p=0.049, R2=0.25 ). 
WGCNA  identified  4 modules correlated to PGES  duration , including  positive correlation  (p=0.040 , corr.=0.5 2) 
to synaptic transcripts, particularly  potassium channel s (KCNA4 , KCNC4 , KCNH1 , KCNIP4 , KCNJ3 , KCNJ6 , 
KCNK1 ). No modules were associated with serotonin  receptor  signaling.  
Significance  
Increased h ippocampal 5HT2A receptor protein  and potassium channel  transcripts  may reflect underlying 
mechanisms contributing to or resulting from  prolonged PGES . Future studies with larger cohorts should  
assess  functional analyses  and additional brain regions  to help elucidate mechanisms  underlying PGES  and 
sudden unexpected death in epilepsy ( SUDEP ) risk .  
Keywords:  serotonin, PGES, SUDEP , hippocampus  Key Points:  
- The 5HT2A receptor protein positively correlated with PGES duration  in the hippocampus of  TLE 
patients . 
 
- The transcripts HTR3B  negatively correlated and HTR4  positively correlated with PGES duration  in 
hippocampus.  
 
- Potassium channel transcripts po sitively correlated with PGES duration  in hippocampus.   Introduction  
Postictal generalized EEG suppression (PGES) may occur after a generalized tonic -clonic seizure (GTCS) and 
increase risk of sudden unexp ected death in epilepsy (SUDEP).1-3  Prolonged PGES is associated with  
impai red arousal, res piration, and other autonomic functions .1 PGES has been suggested as a potential 
SUDEP biomarker ,1-5 and occurs with autonomic  dysfunction  and respiratory arrest in SUDEP animal 
models.6,7 
Potential mechanisms underlying  PGES and  SUDEP include dysfunctional serotonin signaling,8 as serotonin 
modulates respiration, arousal, and s eizures .9 In temporal lobe  epilepsy  (TLE)  patients, MRI and PET imaging  
reveal ed decreased 5HT1A  receptor  binding .10,11 In animal models, elevated serotonin reduce d seizures , 
seizures reduced serotonergic firing,  low serotonin or  serotonin receptor deletion  (5HT1A , 5HT2C , 5HT4, 
5HT7 ) promote d seizures , and 5HT1A overexpression result ed in sporadic autonomic dysfunction and death .12-
19 The 5HT2 receptor family generally facilitates excitatory effects ,15 thus 5HT2A antagonists may provide 
improvement of epilepsy.20,21 The midbrain periaqueductal  gray area undergoes atrophy in SUDEP cases ,23 
and we recently identified altered signaling pathways in the dorsal raphe  of SUDEP compared to controls .24 In 
high-risk SUDEP patients, hippocampal SERT protein expression was increased.19 In the brainstem, an a nimal 
model  linked PGES to dysfunctional serotonin signaling and dorsal raphe stimulation reduced PGES 
duration.22 With increasing PGES duration , interictal serum serotonin is decreased in epilepsy patients ,26 
although serotonin levels have not been studied in brain tissue .  
We evaluated whether PGES duration  recorded during presurgical evaluation correlated to serotonin receptor 
expression  and RNAseq data  in resected hippocampus  and temporal cortex of TLE patients . 
 
Methods  
Human Brain Tissue . Surgical brain tissue was obtained with approval by the New York University School of 
Medicine Institutional Review Board (IRB , #17 -00398 ). Frozen  brain tissue and formalin fixed paraffin 
embedded (FFPE) tissue for protein analyses were available from  TLE patients undergoing surgical resection 
at the NYU  Epilepsy Brain Bank , Amsterdam Medical Center,  University College of London,  and Thomas 
Jefferson University.  Informed consent was provided by each patient, and patients were enrolled in the brain tissue repositories from 2003 to 2019.  Patients were considered for analyses who had a GTCS recorded by 
EEG prior to surgical resection. PGES  occurrence and duration  was determined  by epileptologists (CS, RT, 
DF) from one video -EEG for each patient  based on criteria previously described .27 Patients were selected to 
provide coverage of the PGES spectrum, including no PGES  (0 seconds) , PGES <  50 sec onds  associated with 
low-risk SUDEP, and PGES ≥  50 sec onds  associated with high -risk SUDEP.3 Case history is summarized in 
Table 1  and detailed in Supplemental Table 1 , with 13 cases overlap ping in hippocampus for protein , histology , 
and RNAseq analyses . 
Western blot . Protein was isolated from frozen brain tissue  (40 mg/sample)  at 20% weight/volume  in Tris -NaCl 
buffer (20 mM Tris base, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton -X 100, protease an d phosphatase inhibitors  at pH 7.5)  
using a hand held homogenizer equipped with a pestle  on ice. Samples were incubated on ice for 15 minutes , 
centrifuged for 15 minutes at 14,000 g, 4°C, and supernatant was isolated. Protein concentration was 
determined by BCA assay  according to the manufacturer’s protocol  (Pierce). Hippocampal ( 30 µg/lane) and 
temporal cortex (40 µ g/lane) lysates were boiled in Bolt LDS Sample Buffer and DTT.  For the hippocampus, 
one sample was included on both gels to allow f or normalization across blots for all samples.  Proteins were 
resolved  on a 4-12% Bis-Tris gel  (Invitrogen ) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes . After blocking in 
5% milk TBST,  blots were probed for 5HT1A (1:500, Abcam ab227165 ), 5HT2A (1:500, San ta Cruz sc-
166775 ), or actin (1:3000, Sigma A5441)  in 5% milk TBST  overnight at 4°C . Blots were incubated with 
corresponding HRP -conjugated secondary antibodies (1:3000, GE Healthcare) for 1 hour at room temperature. 
Bands were visualized after ECL (Pierce ) on a BioRad ChemiDoc  with the NYU Small Instrument Fleet . Blot 
images were analyzed in Fiji ImageJ for quantification with intensity normalized to actin.  
Immunohistochemistry.  Subregional protein expression  was assessed by immunohistochemistry as 
described.28 FFPE blocks were sectioned ( 8 µm) by the NYU Center for Biospecimen Research and 
Development (CBRD). Sections  were deparaffinized and rehydrated through a series of xylenes and ethanol 
dilutions, followed by heat -induced antigen retrieval with 10 mM s odium citrate and 0.05% Triton-x 100 at pH 6. 
Sections were blocked with 10% normal donkey serum and incubated with 5HT1A (1:100, Abcam ab227165 ) 
or 5HT2A (1:100, Santa Cruz sc-166775 ) primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. Corresponding secondary 
antibodies  were used (donkey anti -rabbit Alexa -Fluor 568, donkey anti -mouse Alexa -Fluor 488 ; Thermofisher)  
with DAPI counterstain  and slides were coverslipped.  Whole slide scanning was performed on each section at 20X magnification on a NanoZoomer HT2 (Hamamatsu) mi croscope  with the NYU Experimental Pathology 
Research Laboratory  (hippocampus)  or the Leica Aperio Versa 8 microscope  (temporal cortex) . We analyzed 
one image in each  hippocampal  subregion  and three images in the temporal cortex  at 5X magnification in Fiji 
ImageJ by the same binary threshold for all images to determine the number of positive pixels in each image, 
reported as percentage of total image area.  
RNAseq . We also analy zed our RNAse q dataset28,29 in the European Genome -phenome Archive 
(EGAS00001003922) in hippocampus of  TLE patients for whom we could obtain an evaluation of PGES 
duration . Case histor ies were previously  detailed28,29 and are summarized in Table 1.  
Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) . WGCNA was performed on our RNAseq dataset28,29 
to determine whether PGES duration  correlated to  RNAseq  in the R environment with the WGCNA  package 
with defaults as described ,30 except as stated. Soft threshold power beta was determined at R2 = 0.8 (power = 
8), minModuleSize = 150 , and deepSplit = 4 . Gene ontology  (GO)  annotations for mo dules w ere determined 
following WGCNA with the anRichment  package in the R environment with Entrez IDs against the human 
GOcollection  (Supplemental Table 2). GO annotations were considered with a  false discovery rate  (FDR) < 
5%. 
Statistical analyses.  Statistical analyses used  GraphPad Prism (version 9) and the R environment ( http://www.r -
project.org/ ). Western blot and histology c orrelation analyses were calculated by a Pearson correlation. A p value 
< 0.05 was considered significant.  
 
Results  
Case History  
Clinical history is summarized in Table 1  and detailed in Supplemental Table 1  for each analysis , including 
cases with coverage of the PGES  duration  spectrum  (range PGES 0 – 93 seconds) : no PGES  (0 seconds) , 
PGES <  50 sec onds  associated with low -risk SUDEP, and PGES ≥  50 seconds associated with high -risk 
SUDEP . There were a total of 36 cases  (range: age at surgery 14 – 64, epilepsy onset 0 – 51, epilepsy durat ion 2 – 53 years of age)  evaluated across all analyses , and  13 of the same cases with hippocampal tissue 
were evaluated  in protein, histology, and RNAseq analyses.   
 
5HT1A and 5HT2A  Protein Expression in Whole Brain Homogenate  
Western blot of whole brain homogenate from resected hippocampus ( n = 16, Figure 1A) and temporal cortex 
(n = 9, Figure 1B) revealed variable 5HT1A (55 kDa)  expression  among TLE  patients.  In the hippocampus, 
5HT1A did not correlat e with PGES duration (p = 0.87, R2 = 0.0020; Figure 1C). In temporal cortex, 5HT1A 
was expressed  at a lower level than in hippocampus and did not correlat e with  PGES duration (p = 0. 45, R2 = 
0.085; Figure 1D). Hippocamp al 5HT2A (55 kDa) positive ly correlat ed with PGES duration (p = 0.0024, R2 = 
0.52; Figure 1E).  Temporal cortex 5HT2A was expressed  at lower level s than in hippocampus and there was 
no correlation  with PGES duration (p = 0.20, R2 = 0.22; Figure 1F).  
 
5HT1A and 5HT2A  Protein Expression Histologically  
5HT1A and 5HT2A expression was evaluated  histologically in hippocampus  (n = 16, dentate gyrus and CA4 
subsector) and temporal cortex  (n = 9)  by PGES duration . In dentate gyrus , CA4, and temporal cortex  (Figure 
2A-F), 5HT1A expression was not correlated with  PGES duration  (Figure 2G-I). In dentate gyrus , CA4, and 
temporal cortex  (Figure 3A -F), there was no correlation of 5HT2A expression and PGES duration  (Figure 3 G-
I). 
 
RNAseq  in Hippocampus  
To determine whether  5HT1A and 5HT2A (encoded by  HTR1A  and HTR2A ) as well as other  serotonin 
receptor s correlated to PGES duration , we analyzed  our previous RNAseq dataset28,29 (n = 16 ), overlapping 
with 13 patients  with hippocampal  protein data (Table 1, Supplemental Figure 1A ). There were 14 serotonin  
receptor s detected  in the hippocampus (Figure 4A) , with two receptors significantly correl ated to PGES 
duration : HTR3B  with a negative correlation (p = 0.043, R2 = 0.26)  and HTR4  with a positive correlation (p = 
0.049, R2 = 0.25; Figure 4B -C).  To assess  enrich ed serotonin signaling pathway  transcripts  associated with PGES  duration , WGCNA was 
performed on our hippocampal dataset28,29 and revealed no enrichment in this brain region (Supplemental 
Table s 2-3). 
WGCNA identified additional transcripts  that correlated with PGES duration  (Supplemental Figure 1) . There 
were 2,597 of 42,753 transcripts that correlated with PGES (p  < 0.05) , distributed among  all 27 modules  
(Supplemental Table 2) . The top two  transcripts  negatively  correlated : PPP1R17  (protein primarily  expressed 
in cerebellum , p = 1.16 x 10-5, R2 = 0.76; M-white module; Supplemental Figure 1B ) and DHRS7  (p = 1.48 x 10-
5, R2 = 0.75;  M-ivory module;  Supplemental Figure 1C ). Among all 27 modules, 4 significantly correlated to 
PGES  (Supplemental Figure 1D) . PGES duration positively correlated with synapse transcripts ( p = 0.040, 
corr. = 0.52 ; included 7 potassium channels: KCNA4 , KCNC4 , KCNH1 , KCNIP4 , KCNJ3 , KCNJ6 , KCNK1 ; 
Supplemental Figure 2 ; Supplemental Table 3 ) and stimulus detection (taste receptors , p = 0.044, corr. = 
0.51). PGES negatively correlated with cellular localization (p = 0.008 4, corr. = -0.63) and developmental 
process transcripts  (p = 0.020, corr. = -0.57). 
Five modules  significantly  correlated to  epilepsy onset , duration , age , and sex , regardless of PGES duration , 
and with no overlap of PGES correlated modules . Epilepsy onset positive ly correlat ed with metabolic 
processes related to ribosomal transcripts (p = 0.007 5, corr . = 0.64 ), mitochondrial transcripts (p = 0.0016, 
corr. = 0. 72), and localization related to neuronal projection (p = 0.022, corr. = 0. 57). Epilepsy duration 
positive ly correlat ed with stimulus detection related to  olfactory receptor s (p = 0.010, corr. = 0.6 2). Age 
positively correlated with metabolic processes related to mitochondrial transcripts (p = 0.00 26, corr. = 0. 55). 
Sex (male gender) positively correlated to a module (p = 1.09 x 10-7, corr. = 0. 94) that did not have a significant 
GO annotation.  There were insufficient  cases with temporal cortex samples to perform WGCNA.  
 
Discussion  
PGES duration  positively correlated  with 5HT2A receptor protein  expression  in hippocampal homogenate from  
TLE patients . 5HT1A receptor protein expression did not correlate to PGES duration in hippocampus or 
temporal lobe.  On h ippocampal RNAseq , PGES  duration  negativ ely correlat ed with HTR3B  (also known as 
5HT3B) and positive ly correlat ed with HTR4  (also known as 5HT4) , but was not correlated with  the serotonin signaling pathway. By WGCNA , PGES duration  positive ly correlat ed with synaptic transcripts (including 
potassium channel s) and stimulus detection,  and negative ly correlat ed with cellular  localization  and 
developmental process transcripts . 
Serotonin and serotonin receptors  are relevant to SUDEP because they modulate seizure  activity , arousal and 
respiration,9,12,20 and preclinical models link PGES to serotonergic signaling .22 In animal models, serotonin 
receptors have o pposing effects on seizure threshold, partly reflecting  ligand  specificity and dose, downstream 
pathways ( e.g., 5HT2A couples with G -proteins and GPC Rs), seizure etiology, and in cell type specific 
expression by brain region ; e.g., excitatory/inhibitory neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes.20,31 The 5HT2 
receptor s facilitate excitation ,15 and 5HT2A antagonists reduce seizures in animal models.20,21 When activated, 
5HT2A  can inhibit  calcium and sodium conductance, release hippocampal arachidonic acid, and influence  
neuronal morphology and plasticity.32 Activation of presynaptic autoreceptor and postsynaptic 5HT1A receptors 
can increase potassium and decrease  calcium conductance, decreas ing neurotransmitter release.32 Imaging 
studies identified decreased 5HT1A  binding in TLE compared to controls .11,33 Among TLE patients, we did not 
observe  5HT1A  changes in this bra in region by PGES  duration . Our prior proteomics stud ies comparing  
SUDEP to non -SUDEP epilepsy did not detect serotonin receptors in the frontal cortex , hippocampus , or 
brainstem nuclei .24,28 Future studies should explore  mechanistic implications of the association between 
increased hippocampal 5HT2A and PGES duration . Does  5HT2A antagonism reduce PGES duration or does 
seizure burden or prolonged PGES upregulate 5HT2A receptor protein expression as a compensatory 
mechanism or epiphenomenon?  
At the RNA level , several transcripts  were associated with PGES duration . HTR3B  (5HT3B) decreased with 
PGES  duration . The 5HT3 receptor is a ligand -gated heteromeric ion channel, and activation results in fast 
depolarization.34 5HT3 receptor agonism increases seizure duration and antagonism decreases severity of 
convulsions and afterdischarge duration.12 HTR4  (5HT4 ) increased with PGES duration . When activated, 5HT4 
inhibits potassium channel conductance  that results in longer hyperexcitability , and is implicated in cell survival 
and spine growth.32 In epilepsy animal models , 5HT4 brainstem protein expression was decreased,35 5HT4 
deletion promote d seizures and increased mortality ,16 and 5HT4 agonism decreased seizure -induced 
respiratory arrest and tonic seizures.36 DHRS7  (dehydrogenase/reductase 7) was a lead  transcript correlating 
with PGES duration . Related  protein s metabolize prostaglandins, lipids, and steroids37,38 and interact with cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2).39 It is unclear the effect that these transcript expression levels may have on 
PGES and SUDEP risk, whether they are altered a s a result of prolonged PGES or contribute to PGES 
duration , and thus should be investigated further . 
Synaptic transcripts, including p otassium channel s, were positive ly correlat ed with PGES duration  (4 voltage -
gated , 2 inw ard rectifiers , 1 two pore domain ). Voltage -gated channels facilitate  repolarization and modify  
duration and delay of action potentials, inward rectifiers maintain resting membrane potential, and two pore 
domain  channels contribute to leak current important for resting membrane pote ntial.40,41 Potassium channels 
are not implicated in PGES, but  potassium conductance , expression,  and gain and loss -of-function mutations  
can cause  epilepsy and may increase SUDEP risk.40,42,43 A compa rison of the same TLE cases in this study to 
controls in another of our studies  did not identify an alteration to these 7 potassium channels in hippocampus 
by RNAseq.29 Our SUDEP proteomics stud ies24,28 did not detect the same  potassium channels  in the current 
study . Five different  potassium channels  were detected but were similar  in frontal cortex and hippocampus ,28 
and three potassium channels in brainstem nuclei were detected and not altered  between SUDEP and non -
SUDEP epilepsy .24 Follow up studies should investigate whether the  altered potassium channel RNA  
correspond s to functional changes , whether excitatory or inhibitory neurons are imp acted differently, and 
evaluate additional brain regions like the brainstem. Increas ed voltage -gated potassium channels may be a  
compensatory response  to hyperexcitability  or shift voltage activation to more negative potential s contributing 
to hyperexcitability , similar to  gain-of-function KCNH143 mutations . Alternatively, they may reflect an  
overcompensation  coupled with dysregulation  that suppress es brain activity  in PGES.  
There were several other correlations to clinical history. PGES duration  also negative ly correlat ed with cellular 
localization  and developmental process transcripts, and positively correlated with stimulus detection  related to 
taste receptors . Neuronal m igration defects occur  in epilepsy44 and taste receptors45 are expressed in extra -
oral regions and altered in some disease states . Four other modules with GO annotations were associated with 
clinical history . Localization related to neuronal projection  and metabolic processes positive ly correlat ed with 
epilepsy onset , indicating these transcripts were more  elevated at a later age of epilepsy onset  than in patients 
with an earlier onset . Epilepsy o nset age is positively  related to age at surgery, in which a positive correlation 
was similarly  seen for mitochondrial transcripts.  Further, e pilepsy duration positive ly correlat ed with  stimulus 
detection  related to  olfactory receptors , indicating these transcripts were more el evated in patients with prolonged epilepsy duration  than those with a shorter duration . Hippocampal o lfactory receptors have non -
sensory functions , ligands include endogenous molecules, and expression is abnormally regulated in 
neurodegeneration .46 The meaning of these clinical history associations requires further investig ation at the 
protein and functional levels.  
Our study had  several  limitations. PGES duration  can vary in the same patient during different seizure s and the 
number of convulsive seizures captured on video -EEGs was limited .1,5,49 5HT2A and 5HT1A  protein levels may 
vary between western blot and histology detection techniques due to subregional differences and differences in 
detection method based on  solubility  and other factors  as we and others have reported  (time to tissue 
processing/freezing) .50 RNAseq did not correlat e HTR1A  or HTR2A  (5HT1A or 5HT2A) to PGES. Protein 
changes may not correspond to transcript changes,30 although overall pathway analysis may be more 
comparable. Hippocampal sclerosis was present in most cases for protein analyses (n=13/16, predominantly 
ILAE type 1), however neuronal loss was not  associated with decrease d serotonin receptors. Patients were not 
evaluated for pathogenic gene variants.  
In summary , increased 5HT2A  protein and potassium channel  signaling transcripts  in TLE patients  were 
associated with prolonged PGES.  Future studies should  investigate  serotonin receptor protein expression 
(5HT1A, 5HT2A, 5HT3B, 5HT4)  and potassium channels in patients with PGES and in  SUDEP cases , 
particularly in  hippocampal subregions  and the brainst em.
