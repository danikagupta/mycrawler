14 Immobilization as a powerful Bioremediation tool for abatement 
15 of dye pollution: A review
16 Abstract: Dyes are xenobiotic compounds widely used by textile, leather, paper, printing, food, 
17 pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries. Decolorization and dye degradation in the effluents is a 
18 prime hurdle in its treatment, and there is still a shortage of economically attractive and easy-to-
19 operate treatments that can eliminate dye pollution. In recent years, chemical-based treatments 
20 are being replaced by greener technologies at the lab and industrial scale to combat dye 
21 pollution. It is noteworthy that immobilization is a biotechnological tool that greatly enhances 
22 bioremediation's potential. The present review has covered the basic concepts of 
23 immobilization, including the different immobilization techniques and the various carriers used 
24 for immobilization. The efficient immobilization of a biocatalyst depends on the proper choice 
25 of a carrier combined with a suitable immobilization technique. Hence, this review provides a 
26 comparative analysis of the different immobilization techniques and carriers used. Further, there 
27 is an in-depth discussion on the potential of immobilized enzymes and cells as bioremediation 
28 agents for dye degradation. Nearly all the studies indicated that immobilization enhanced the 
29 biodecolorization of colored wastewater compared to free systems. Further, the potential of 
30 immobilized systems for large scale industrial implementation was also examined. The article 
31 ends with a note on the loopholes of research on immobilization and future scopes of this 
32 technique.

35 Introduction
36 Industrialization is an essential pillar of socioeconomic growth. However, it has consequences in disrupting 
37 environmental health (Bilal and Asgher 2015a; Lade et al. 2015). Considerable amounts of wastewater are 
38 generated year-round through different industrial processes. It was estimated that more than 80% of industrial 
39 effluent is released globally without proper treatment (Connor et al. 2017). The dyeing industry is a crucial 
40 generator of environmental pollution in terms of the large volume of water usage and the chemical composition 
41 of the wastewater. A significant concern is the release of industrial dyes or dye-containing toxic industrial 
42 effluent without or with ineffective treatment (Verlicchi et al. 2012; Ba et al. 2014; Hayat et al. 2015; Zucca et 
43 al. 2016). Synthetic dyes have a broad application in diverse industries viz., textile, leather, printing ink, paper, 
44 pulp, plastic, photographic, cosmetics, food, and medicine (Benkhaya et al. 2020). Generally, color indexing Page 2 of 74

345 enlists about 8000 chemically differing synthetic dyes registered with 40,000 different trade names (Yuan et al. 
46 2020). Among these synthetic dyes, azo dyes are the commercially dominant class of dyestuffs. Chrysoidine is 
47 among the earliest commercial azo dyes and is used for dyeing cotton. Mordant Black 17 is widely used by the 
48 textile and dyeing industry. Direct Red dye is used for dyeing leather. Reactive Blue 171 is used for dyeing 
49 cellulosic fibers. Azo dyes as Tartrazine, Yellow 2G, Sunset Yellow, Ponceau 4R are frequently applied in the 
50 food industry (Benkhaya et al. 2020). Anthraquinones, phthalocyanines, aryl-carboniums, and polymethines are 
51 the other dye classes (Gordon and Gregory 1987). The textile industry alone utilizes more than 3600 different 
52 types of chemical dyes (Kant 2012). During the dyeing process, not all of the dyes are fixed and what remains is 
53 discharged along with wastewater. The amount of dye lost varies among the different dye classes. The amount 
54 of unfixed dye ranges from 20-50% for reactive dyes, 30-40% for sulfur dyes, 5-10% for azoic dyes,  5-20% for 
55 vat and direct dyes, 7-20% for acid and disperse dyes, 2-3% for basic dyes, and  1-2% for pigment dyes (Ghaly 
56 et al. 2014). Azo dyes, in particular, are associated with several hazardous environmental impacts. For example, 
57 untreated wastewater from the industries pollute water bodies by rendering them unsuitable for other purposes, 
58 reducing sunlight penetration thereby affecting photosynthesis, and it severely impacts the equilibrium of 
59 aquatic ecosystems as a result of their carcinogenic, genotoxic, and mutagenic nature (Vandevivere et al. 1998; 
60 Suteu et al. 2009; Hassan and El Nemr 2017). For a long time, scientists have made rigorous attempts to devise 
61 efficient, cost-effective techniques to remediate dye-containing wastewater. An array of treatment techniques 
62 has been developed, which include physicochemical, biological, and combined treatment processes. Few 
63 treatment methods currently being used for dye removal includes flocculation, sedimentation, dissolved air 
64 floatation, clarification, neutralization, precipitation, activated sludge process, biological filters, anaerobic 
65 treatment systems, granular media filtration, membrane filtration, reverse osmosis systems, ultrafiltration, 
66 nanofiltration, ion exchange, activated carbon, and ultraviolet disinfection (Robinson et al. 2001; Wang et al. 
67 2011). These methods can be used as preliminary, primary, secondary, tertiary, or advanced treatments. 
68 However, these processes suffer significant drawbacks in terms of their high energy requirement, impractical 
69 reaction conditions, high sludge formation, secondary pollution problem, complex procedures, high cost, and 
70 low efficiency (Shaw et al. 2002; Zhang et al. 2004; Aravindhan et al. 2007; Sarioglu et al. 2007; Wang et al. 
71 2009). Hence, there remains an urgency for a highly efficient and economical treatment method for dye 
72 removal. Environmental engineers put considerable effort into developing new methods or improving the 
73 existing technologies (dos Santos et al. 2007; Kabra et al. 2013; Sathishkumar et al. 2014). However, newly 
74 developed technologies are not employed at a large scale because they are expensive, labor-intensive, require Page 3 of 74

475 extreme operational conditions, secondary pollution, and have a low spectrum of activity for decolorizing dyes 
76 with different chemical structures (Fongsatitkul et al. 2004; Fersi and Dhahbi 2008; Hayat et al. 2015). 
77 Although bioremediation is a relatively modern tool, the concept has existed for quite a while.  This 
78 strategy initially received a lot of enthusiasm but suffered through failures. The accompanying failures in turn 
79 helped develop a more practical approach to bioremediation. Continuing research has highlighted some of the 
80 limitations of bioremediation, and there remains room for improvement. Biological removal of dyestuff follows 
81 three underlying mechanisms: (1) biosorption on biomass, (2) biodegradation by cells, and (3) biodegradation 
82 by enzymes (Khan et al. 2013). The large-scale application of bioremediation techniques by industries is 
83 hindered by two major drawbacks: stability for long-term operation, and the issue of recovery and reuse.  
84 Immobilization of the bioremediation agent improves its survival, stability, and retention. Immobilization is 
85 slowly gaining importance in wastewater treatment as it delivers better results when compared to the activity of 
86 free cells or enzymes (Bilal and Asgher 2015a; Talha et al. 2017; Bayramoglu and Yilmaz 2018). The efficient 
87 use of bioremediation requires patience and, when used appropriately, might deliver substantial long-term 
88 benefits.  
89 A considerable amount of research data is available on immobilization and its potential application in the 
90 field of environmental remediation. This article intends to provide researchers with a comprehensive review of 
91 all aspects of immobilization. This article discusses the types of immobilization and carrier selections for 
92 immobilization. Further, the application of this technique for immobilizing cells and enzymes for dye removal 
93 will be elaborated. . In contrast to review papers that focus on dye removal of either immobilized enzymes or 
94 cells, this article will provide important insights into the potential of immobilization for dye removal by both 
95 enzymes and cells. It also attempts to pinpoint the loopholes of this technique and provide a direction for future 
96 development.
97 1. Immobilization
98 Immobilization refers to the technique of entrapping or anchoring biocatalysts in or on an inert carrier or 
99 support, rendering them more stable and functionally reusable. The carrier involved in immobilization allows 
100 for the interchange of media, which contain the substrate or effector or inhibitor molecules (Zhu 2007). There is 
101 a broad spectrum of immobilization and it has been used with various biocatalysts including enzymes, cellular 
102 organelles, microbial, animal, and plant cells. Immobilization is a natural phenomenon, as pointed out by 
103 Radwan et al. (2002). In their study, samples of microalgae along the Arabian Gulf coast were examined and Page 4 of 74

5104 covered by a biofilm of oil-degrading bacteria found in seawater and that are capable of hydrocarbon 
105 degradation. In 1969, Japan applied enzyme immobilization for the first time to continuously produce L-amino 
106 acids from acyl DL-amino acids. Immobilization methods have been used extensively ever since, in many 
107 laboratories (Chibata 1996).  Immobilization provides several advantages when applied in the arena of 
108 environmental biotechnology including: 1) improvement of biodegradation efficiency, 2) cost reduction as 
109 multiple usages of remediation agents is possible, 3) elimination of filtration of the remediation agents, 4) 
110 reduction in the risk of undergoing genetic mutations, 5) a stable microenvironment for the remediation agents, 
111 6) resistance to shear forces when operated in a bioreactor, 7) improvement of resistance of the agents towards 
112 harsh environmental conditions, 8) extension of storage period for the biocatalysts, and 9)  enhancement of the 
113 tolerance of remediation agents towards high pollutant concentrations (Kourkoutas et al. 2004; Wojcieszyńska 
114 et al. 2012; Rivelli et al. 2013; Bayat et al. 2015).
115 a. Immobilization Techniques
116 There are five main immobilization techniques currently in practice: (a) adsorption, (b) binding on a surface 
117 (electrostatic or covalent), (c) copolymerization or crosslinking, (d) entrapment, and (e) encapsulation 
118 (Kourkoutas et al. 2004; Sun et al. 2011; Bayat et al. 2015) (Fig. 1). The following subsections are a brief 
119 account of each of these techniques. Table 1. illustrates a comparative analysis of the advantages and 
120 disadvantages of the five types of immobilization techniques (Dubey 2010; Elnashar 2011; Bayat et al. 2015).
121 Adsorption
122 Adsorption immobilization is the binding of biocatalysts to the outer or inner surface of a carrier by forming low 
123 energy bonds such as ionic bonding, hydrogen bonding, and van der Waals forces (Cristóvão et al. 2011; Hou et 
124 al. 2014; Jesionowski et al. 2014). This process is reversible. The main reason for successful adsorption is the 
125 presence of an enzyme/ cell- carrier affinity. Affinity is the consequence of certain functional groups present on 
126 the carrier. However, in the absence of such groups, interactions can be generated by the addition of an 
127 intermediate agent (carrier modifiers). There are four main techniques to achieve immobilization by adsorption: 
128 the static process, the dynamic batch process, the reactor loading process, and the electrodeposition process 
129 (Bilal et al. 2017b). Enzymes of the class oxidoreductase such as tyrosinase, laccase, peroxidase established as 
130 potential green catalysts have been successfully immobilized onto carriers via adsorption for dye removal (Valli 
131 et al. 1990; Ihekata and Nicell, 2000; Qiu et al. 2009; Faccio et al. 2012; Šekuljica et al. 2016a; Senthivelan et Page 5 of 74

6132 al. 2016; Tonin et al. 2016; Shaheen et al. 2017; Yehia and Rodriguez-Couto 2017). However, most research has 
133 been conducted with laccases (Cristóvão et al. 2011; Bayramoglu et al. 2012b; Zhang et al. 2014). Peralta-
134 Zamora et al. (2003) investigated the dye degradation potential of immobilized fungal laccases by adsorption on 
135 different supports. Silica modified with imidazole groups supported an enzyme activity of 12 U g-1. In a 
136 continuous study, immobilized laccase was able to decolorize 90% of Reactive Orange 122 in the presence of 
137 mediator 1-hydroxy benzotriazole in the eighth cycle. In a recent study, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was 
138 immobilized through adsorption and covalent bonding methods on a novel carrier Purolite® A109 (Šekuljica et 
139 al. 2020). Adsorption immobilization yielded comparatively higher enzyme activity (156.21 ± 1.41 U g-1) but 
140 lower operational stability (~60% activity after 10 cycles) and lower shelf life (~60% activity after 4weeks of 
141 storage). Adsorption immobilized HRP (IM-HRP) showed a slight increase in dye removal (~75%) of Acid 
142 Violet 109 compared to covalent IM-HRP (~70%) within 30 min. Relatively few research articles are available 
143 on cell immobilization via adsorption. Fungi such as Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Trametes hirsute have been 
144 most commonly examined for their capability to degrade dye (Guimarães et al. 2002; Couto et al. 2004; 
145 Pazarlioglu et al. 2005). Lade et al. (2015) immobilized a microbial consortium on polyurethane foam by 
146 adsorption. The immobilized consortium was capable of completely removing 100 mg L-1 of Congo Red within 
147 12 h, and 92% of real textile effluent from the American Dye Manufacturing Institute within 20 h. In another 
148 study, Brevibacillus parabrevis was immobilized by adsorption on coconut shell biochar (Abu Talha et al. 
149 2018). Immobilized bacterium operated efficiently in a continuous bioreactor and was capable of 88.92% of dye 
150 removal at a concentration of up to 500 ppm.
151 Covalent Binding
152 Immobilization through covalent binding occurs by the formation of a covalent bond between chemical groups 
153 on enzymes or cells, and chemical groups on the carrier surface. The immobilization procedure follows the 
154 binding of a coupling agent followed by activation, or attachment of a chemical group, and finally binding to the 
155 enzyme or cell (Martins et al. 2013). This technique is the most irreversible and stable. The different covalent 
156 binding methods are diazotization, peptide bond formation, group activation, and polyfunctional reagents (Bilal 
157 et al. 2017b). In comparison to enzymes, covalent binding is not commonly used for cell immobilization. 
158 Binding or cross-linking involves cytotoxicity and results in cellular death. It is difficult to prevent cellular 
159 damage during this process, and hence it is applied mainly for enzyme immobilization (Bayat et al. 2015). Some 
160 of the enzymes covalently immobilized for dye degradation include laccase, azoreductase, and HRP (Šekuljica Page 6 of 74
© The Author(s) or their Institution(s)Environmental ReviewsDraft
7161 et al. 2016b; Qi et al. 2017; Zhu et al. 2020). Arica et al. (2009) utilized a spacer arm (1,6-diaminihexane) 
162 attached poly (glycidyl methacrylate/ethylene glycol dimetacrylate) beads support to covalently immobilize 
163 laccase and experimented with its potential for the degradation of Reactive Red 120 (RR 120). An amount of 4.6 
164 mg g-1 of laccase was immobilized on the carrier which yielded an enzyme activity of 88%. In batch mode, 91% 
165 of RR 120 was degraded within 10 h. The enzyme activity was over 50% even after six cycles of repeated dye 
166 addition. Another study also covalently immobilized laccase on magnetized (Fe 3O4 nanoparticles) chitosan 
167 beads (Nadaroglu et al. 2019). The relative activity of immobilized laccase was increased 2-folds in contrast to 
168 free laccase under optimum conditions. Immobilized laccase was capable of degrading several synthetic dyes as 
169 Reactive Black 5 (73%), Direct Blue 15 (95%), Evans Blue (96%), and Acid Red 37 (97%) at a contact time of 
170 60 min. HRP covalently immobilized on amine-functionalized glycidyl methacrylate-g-poly (ethylene 
171 terephthalate) fibers, removed 98% of Methyl Orange dye, while free enzymes removed only 79% of dyes 
172 within a contact time of 45 min. Immobilized HRP retained 69.9% of its relative activity, even after 10 cycles of 
173 repeated usage (Arslan 2011). In a similar report, HRP was immobilized covalently on various polysulfone 
174 supports (Hydroxyl-terminated bisphenol A- and bisphenol AF-based polysulfones) (Celebi et al. 2013). 
175 Immobilized HRP was capable of decolorizing >85% of Reactive Blue 19 and Acid Black 1 within 1 h. The 
176 immobilized enzyme retained 70% of its activity even after three reuses and gradually decreased thereafter.
177 Cross-Linking or Copolymerisation
178 Cross-linking is described as covalent bond formation between a variety of molecules of an enzyme or cell with 
179 the help of polyfunctional reagents such as glutaraldehyde, diazonium salt, hexamethylene diisocyanate, and N-
180 N′ ethylene bismaleimide. The primary methods of immobilization by crosslinking are insoluble aggregate 
181 formation by crosslinking of cells or enzymes with glutaraldehyde, enzyme adsorption followed by cross-
182 linking, and enzyme or cell impregnation of a porous carrier followed by enzyme or cellular cross-linking in 
183 pores (Dubey 2010; Bilal et al. 2017b). Cross-linking generates high molecular weight insoluble aggregates, and 
184 since covalent bond formation is involved, they lead to a conformational change of the biocatalysts, resulting in 
185 loss of activity. Another disadvantage that limits the application of cross-linking, is the gelatinous physical 
186 appearance of the biocatalyst aggregates.  It is often used in combination with other immobilization techniques 
187 to prevent biocatalyst leakage. Several enzymes such as laccase, tyrosinase, and peroxidases have been 
188 immobilized via crosslinking and used for dye degradation (Wu et al. 2001; Kumar et al. 2014b; Nguyen et al. 
189 2016; Bilal et al. 2017c; Ma et al. 2018; Veismoradi et al. 2019). In a study performed by Bayramoglu et al. Page 7 of 74
© The Author(s) or their Institution(s)Environmental ReviewsDraft
8190 (2012a), HRP was initially adsorbed on polyaniline grafted polyacrylonitrile film and then cross-linked using 
191 glutaraldehyde. Immobilized HRP degraded 79% of Direct Black-38 and 53% of Direct Blue 53, whereas the 
192 free enzyme could degrade only 48% Direct Black 38 and 39% Direct Blue 53 within 6 h of interaction period. 
193 The immobilized enzyme also showed excellent reusability for up to 30 assays. Another interesting study co-
194 immobilized Phanerochaete chrysosporium cells with cross-linked fungal enzyme aggregates (lignin peroxidase 
195 (LiP), manganese peroxidase (MnP), and laccase) in calcium-alginate beads (Li et al. 2015). The co-
196 immobilized gel beads worked as an efficient biodegradation system and showed enhanced degradation of dyes 
197 Acid Violet 7 (93.4%) and Basic Fuchsin (67.9%). However, the reusability of the beads was reduced to ~45% 
198 after 4 cycles due to leakage of the cross-linked enzyme aggregates. MnP was crosslinked and immobilized in 
199 chitosan beads for the degradation of textile effluent (Bilal et al. 2016b). The immobilized enzyme decolorized 
200 diluted and undiluted textile wastewater in the range of ~97% to ~67%, which was much higher compared to 
201 free enzyme. The immobilized enzyme was also capable of retaining 60% of its activity even after 10 batches of 
202 effluent decolorization. Similarly, laccase was also cross-linked and immobilized in chitosan microspheres 
203 (Asgher et al. 2017). Immobilized laccase showed decolorization of five different textile dyes Sandal-fix Red 
204 C4BL, Sandal-fix violet P4RN, Sandal-fix Golden yellow CRL, Sandal-fix Black BR, and Sandal-fix Turq. Blue 
205 GWF in the range of 98.7% - 89.36% after 4 h of interaction period. The immobilized enzyme was also capable 
206 of retaining more than 60% of its activity after nine cycles of Sandal-fix Red C 4BL decolorization. Research 
207 remains sparse on the applicability of cells immobilized by cross-linking in dye degradation. 
208 Entrapment
209 Enzymes or cells can be physically entrapped inside synthetic or natural polymeric networks. A permeable 
210 membrane allows substrate and product molecules to pass through but preserves the biocatalyst. The methods 
211 for entrapment immobilization include gel inclusion, fiber inclusion, and microcapsule inclusion (Bernfeld and 
212 Wan 1963). The critical point in the entrapment of microorganisms is the ratio of the pore size of the carrier to 
213 that of the cell diameter. If the pore size is bigger than the immobilized cells, then it will cause leakage. It is an 
214 irreversible technique (Kourkotas et al. 2004; Bayat et al. 2015). The entrapment of microorganisms has been 
215 widely used in the field of bioremediation. Organisms like Pseudomonas luteola, T. hirsute , microbial 
216 consortium (containing organisms as Aeromonas hydrophila, Comamonas testosterone, and Acinetobacter 
217 baumannii ), Bacillus firmus, Enterobacter agglomerans, Bacillus sp., Lysinibacillus sp., Proteus vulgaris 
218 NCIM-2027 were immobilized by entrapment techniques and were capable of successful dye decolorization Page 8 of 74

9219 (Chen et al. 2003b; Moutaouakkil et al. 2004; Domínguez et al. 2005; Chen and Lin 2007; Saratale et al. 2011; 
220 Ogugbue et al. 2012; Pandey et al. 2019). In a recent study, El-Sheekh (2020) used cell immobilization 
221 techniques to remediate various types of industrial wastewaters. A bacterial mixture was immobilized in alginate 
222 beads to treat the effluent of a textile and dyeing industry. A decolorization of 98% was obtained followed by 
223 significant reductions in phosphate content, chemical oxygen demand, biological oxygen demand, total 
224 suspended solids, ammonia, oil and grease content, total nitrogen content, total solids, electrical conductivity, 
225 and total dissolved solids. Several peroxidases (HRP, bitter gourd peroxidase, soybean peroxidase) and fungal 
226 laccases were also immobilized by entrapment and used for dye removal (Mohan et al. 2005; Satar and Hussain 
227 2011; Kalsoom et al. 2013; Zheng et al. 2016; Teerapatsakul et al. 2017). Asgher et al. (2012) immobilized 
228 fungal laccase by entrapment in a sol-gel matrix of trimethoxysilane and propyltetramethoxysilane. Immobilized 
229 laccase showed complete decolorization of Drimarine blue K2RL dye within 5 h reaction time. It also showed 
230 high decolorization rates (97%-100%) for different textile effluents within the same period.  In another study, 
231 MnP was entrapped in an agarose gel matrix for effluent decolorization (Bilal et al. 2017a). Immobilized 
232 enzyme was applied in a packed bed reactor for the decolorization of five different textile effluents. Maximum 
233 decolorization for all the effluents was obtained in the range of 78.9% to 98.4% after six consecutive cycles. 
234 Entrapped MnP also maintained more than 50% of its activity even after the fifth reaction cycle. 
235 Encapsulation
236 Encapsulation is comparable to the entrapment technique. This process is also irreversible. In this case, cells or 
237 enzymes are trapped within a semipermeable membrane. The immobilized biocatalyst has mobility inside the 
238 core space. It is a physicochemical or mechanical process in which the entrapped encapsulated particles (called 
239 the core material) lie within a shell or coating, resembling a capsule with few millimeters in thickness 
240 (Krishnamoorthi et al. 2015). Similar to the entrapment technique, the semi-permeability of the membrane in 
241 encapsulation allows the free flow of substrate and nutrient molecules while retaining the biocatalyst within the 
242 membrane. Encapsulation also relies on the ratio of the pore size of the membrane to that of the core material. 
243 Enzymes like HRP and laccases have been extensively studied for their ability to degrade dyes after 
244 encapsulation (Dai et al. 2010; Jiang et al. 2014; Koyani and Vazquez-Duhalt 2016). Le et al. (2016) constructed 
245 a core-shell system of copper alginate incorporated with Fe 2O3 for encapsulating laccase. Laccase beads 
246 decolorized Remazole Brilliant Blue R in the range of 54.2% to 75.8% after an interaction period of 4 h. 
247 Additionally, immobilized laccase showed dye decolorization property (37.6% and 54.8%) even in real Page 9 of 74

10248 wastewater, whereas free laccase activity was inhibited. Salgaonkar et al. (2019) immobilized peroxidase within 
249 a metal-organic framework and applied it for the decolorization of Methylene Blue (85.6%) and Congo Red 
250 (89.9%). A reusability assay revealed that the immobilized peroxidase retained 48% residual activity after six 
251 cycles. In a similar study, Li et al. (2020) encapsulated HRP macro-micropore zeolitic imidazole framework-8. 
252 The encapsulated enzyme was able to decolorize Methyl Orange, Congo Red, Rhodamine B, and Rhodamine 
253 6G. Further immobilized enzymes retained more than 90% of its catalytic activity for Cong Red removal after 
254 five reuses and more than 50% activity for Methyl Orange and Rhodamine B removal after 4 reuses. Cell 
255 immobilization via encapsulation is less researched than enzymes. However, few recent studies have 
256 experimented with the potential of cell encapsulation for dye degradation. Sarioglu et al. (2017) encapsulated 
257 bacterial cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 47085 within nanofibrous webs of polyvinyl alcohol and 
258 polyethylene oxide for Methylene Blue removal. Bacterial polyethylene web showed maximal dye removal of 
259 76% at a concentration of 15 mg L-1. In another study cells of Lysinibacillus sp. encapsulated in cyclodextrin 
260 fibers were able to decolorize 82±0.8% of Reactive Black 5 at a concentration of 30 mg L-1 (Keskin et al. 2018). 
261 Maniyam et al. (2018) encapsulated Rhodococcus cells in gellan gum beads. Encapsulated cells showed 
262 complete removal of Methyl Red at a high concentration of 2 g L-1 after 7 h of interaction and were able to retain 
263 its decolorization property even at a concentration of 5 g L-1 after 10 h of interaction. Further, the immobilized 
264 cells showed complete dye removal after nine batch studies, indicating its efficient reusability. In another recent 
265 study, cells of Shewanella xiamenesis were immobilized inside a reduced graphene oxide network (Shen et al. 
266 2019). Encapsulated bacteria decolorized Congo Red (50-400 mg L-1) in the range of 53.6% to 99.9% and 
267 Methylene Blue (10-200 mg L-1) in the range of 75.6% to 99.6%.
268 b. Carriers for immobilization
269 The materials used for cell or enzyme immobilization is called a carrier or support matrix. The selection of 
270 carriers is the most crucial step in the process of immobilization. Not all carrier materials are suitable for 
271 immobilization. The characteristics of the chosen carrier determine the success and result of immobilization.  
272 The nature of the application it is being used for is also an important aspect to be considered when choosing a 
273 carrier. Carriers chosen for wastewater application should possess characteristics such as: 1) insolubility, 2) 
274 absence of toxicity to the immobilized biocatalyst and the environment, 3) environmental safety, 4) non-
275 biodegradability, 5) easy accessibility, 6) ability for easy regeneration, 7) cost-effectiveness, 8) being light-
276 weighted, 9) simplicity of the procedure, 10) high loading capacity of biocatalyst, 11) being capable of an Page 10 of 74

11277 optimal diffusion rate that would favor the flow of media to the carrier core, 12) ability for a long shelf life, 13) 
278 mechanical, biological and chemical stability, and 14) biocompatibility so as not to hamper biocatalyst activity 
279 (Leenen et al. 1996; Zacheus et al. 2000; Zhang et al. 2015; Bayat et al. 2015; Weiser et al. 2016). Most of the 
280 carriers possess few of these mentioned attributes, and therefore, the pros and cons of a carrier should be 
281 considered keeping the particular application in question. 
282 Carriers can be divided into organic, inorganic, and composite carriers based on their chemical 
283 constitution. Organic and inorganic carriers can be additionally subdivided into natural or synthetic. Table 2 
284 depicts several examples of carriers used in immobilization for dye decolorization studies.
285 Inorganic carriers
286 Inorganic carriers are widely used for both enzyme and cellular immobilization (Verma et al. 2006; Shirisha et 
287 al. 2016). They are suitable for immobilization as they: 1) provide extreme stability both mechanically and 
288 thermally, 2) have a large surface area, 3) have a porous structure, and 4) have invariant pore diameter to pore 
289 volume ratio providing a definitive volume and structure to the support (Thielemann et al. 2011; Carlsson et al. 
290 2014; Bapat et al. 2016). The most significant benefit of using inorganic carriers over others is that they are 
291 cost-effective and are naturally abundant. Moreover, biocatalysts are easily attached to inorganic carriers 
292 because of the numerous functional groups. The functionalization of the carriers is also possible with surface 
293 modifying agents. Some of the inorganic carriers commonly used in the field of bioremediation are activated 
294 charcoal, porous glass, silica gel and other silica-based materials, inorganic oxides (titania, zinc oxides, 
295 alumina), minerals (bentonite, kaolin, halloysite) (Shirisha et al. 2016; Bouabidi et al. 2019).
296 Organic carriers
297 A large number of natural organic polymers are water-insoluble polysaccharides such as chitosan, alginates, 
298 cellulose, agarose, k-carrageenan, and gum Arabic (Chang and Juang 2007; Jegannathan et al. 2010; Flores-
299 Maltos et al. 2011; Huang et al. 2011; Shen et al. 2011). Other natural carriers include plant fiber, wood 
300 sawdust, sugarcane bagasse, corncob, and tenzotle (Dzionek et al. 2016). The beneficial features of applying 
301 natural organic polymers are numerous including they are: 1) hydrophilic, 2) biodegradable, 3) biocompatible, 
302 4) largely derived from food industry wastes, and so are cost-effective, 5) able to stabilize their interaction with 
303 the biocatalysts as they have numerous functional groups, 6) able to provide better diffusion rates, and 7) 
304 environment friendly. However, their application in bioremediation is limited by their poor mechanical stability, Page 11 of 74
© The Author(s) or their Institution(s)Environmental ReviewsDraft
12305 their predisposition to biodegradation, their sensitivity towards organic solvents, and their restricted function 
306 within a narrow pH range (Rivelli et al. 2013; Bayat et al. 2015; Cubitto and Gentili 2015; Paliwal et al. 2015).
307 Organic synthetic carriers such as polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene glycol 
308 (PEG), polypropylene ammonium, polyurethane, and polyacrylamide (PAM) are often used in bioremediation 
309 (Stolarzewicz et al. 2011). The advantages that they offer include: 1) structural modification at the 
310 macromolecular level, 2) greater stability than natural organic polymers when applied to wastewater, 3) the 
311 presence of a variety of functional moieties which form strong interactions with the biocatalyst, 4) durability, 
312 and 5) mechanical stability. However, they have low diffusion rates and are often toxic to the biocatalyst (Zhang 
313 et al. 2007; de-Bashan and Bashan 2010).
314 Composite carriers
315 Composite carriers are a combination of both inorganic and organic carriers, hence providing an amalgamation 
316 of characteristic features from each carrier. Composite carriers are functionally superior when compared to 
317 organic and inorganic carriers (Zhang et al. 2016). These types of carriers can be a combination of organic-
318 inorganic, organic-organic, or inorganic-inorganic carriers. They provide advantages including: 1) reusability of 
319 the matrix, 2) strong binding interaction with the biocatalyst, 3) high stability, 4) the ability to be tailor-made for 
320 a selected biocatalyst, and 5) their consequent catalytic process. Some of the examples of composite carriers 
321 include PVA-sodium alginate, PVA-guar gum, chitosan-clay, silica-zinc oxide, silica-magnetite, and chitosan-
322 silica (Ismail and Khudhair 2015; Zdarta et al. 2018). 
323 2. Immobilization of enzymes for dye remediation
324 For years enzymes have been established as efficient biocatalysts characterized by efficient chemo-, regio-, and 
325 stereoselectivity. Enzymes also eliminate the requirement for toxic solvents, lengthy synthesis steps, and 
326 activation energy. These attributes make the biocatalytic process inexpensive and environmentally friendly 
327 (Cowan and Fernandez-Lafuente 2011). Two enzyme families viz. Azoreductases and Laccases have been 
328 proven to be the most efficient for azo dye degradation. Other promising enzymes that have been most 
329 frequently applied for dye degradation belong to the class of oxidoreductases including tyrosinase, manganese, 
330 lignin, and HRP (Bilal et al. 2017b). Though these biocatalysts are efficient, sustainable, and vigorous, they are 
331 often not suitable for industrial exploitation. In this context, enzyme immobilization offers such advantages that Page 12 of 74
© The Author(s) or their Institution(s)Environmental ReviewsDraft
13332 make these biocatalysts industrially desirable. For example, immobilization eliminates instability issues and 
333 provides thermostability (Dubey et al. 2010). It allows enzymes to function in the presence of heavy metals, 
334 high salt concentration, organic solvents, denaturants, and helps overcome autolysis (Gardossi et al. 2010). It 
335 also provides a high enzyme-substrate ratio, reduces contamination risk, allows reusability of enzymes, 
336 enhances process control, and reduces reaction time (Dubey et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2012).
337 Azo reductases are reductive enzymes that reduce azo dyes by cleaving the azo bond, thereby forming 
338 colorless amines. This redox reaction requires mediators like NADH or FADH as electron donors. However, 
339 specific oxygen insensitive or aerobic azo reductases have also been documented (Solis et al. 2012; Sarkar et al. 
340 2017). Although several researchers have established the potential of azoreductases in dye degradation, its 
341 efficiency upon immobilization has been decidedly less researched. Qi et al. (2017) covalently immobilized 
342 aerobic oxidoreductase isolated from strain Rhodococcus opacus 1CP in meso cellular foams. Enzyme stability 
343 increased upon immobilization, and activity was also increased when compared to free enzymes. Lang et al. 
344 (2013) immobilized aerobic azoreductase from strain Brevibacillus laterosporus TISTR1911 onto a nickel 
345 chelating column that was operated in a packed bed reactor. The immobilized enzyme showed efficient 
346 degradation of Methyl Orange within 3 h and could be reused over nine cycles. Using a redox mediator resulted 
347 in speeding up the catalytic process to 1.5 h and could be reused for over 16 cycles.
348 Laccases are copper-containing enzymes belonging to the oxidase family and have less substrate 
349 specificity. Laccases are widely known for their role in xenobiotic compound degradation (Kalyani et al. 2012). 
350 It utilizes a non-specific free radical-mediated process to degrade azo dyes and forms phenolic compounds 
351 (Sudha et al. 2014; Singh et al. 2015). The majority of these enzymes have been isolated from fungi, plants, and 
352 a few from bacteria (Arregui et al. 2019). Extensive research has been performed to investigate the potential of 
353 immobilized laccase to treat dyestuffs. Peralta-Zamora et al. (2003) investigated various carriers for the 
354 immobilization of fungal laccase isolated from T. versicolor. Silica modified by imidazole SiIm was found to be 
355 best suited for immobilization. During the initial stages, dye decolorization was a result of adsorption onto the 
356 carrier, but with subsequent dye addition, adsorption decreased, and enzymatic decolorization was observed. A 
357 study by Zheng et al. (2016) aimed to enhance the stability and reusability of laccase. Fungal laccase from T. 
358 pubescens was cross-linked by glutaraldehyde and then entrapped in chitosan beads. The immobilized enzyme 
359 showed increased degradation of several synthetic dyes in comparison to free enzymes. Immobilization also 
360 considerably enhanced the pH adaptability and thermostability when compared to free enzymes. Even after six 
361 cycles of batch decolorization studies, the immobilized enzyme had an activity above 60%. In a similar study by Page 13 of 74
© The Author(s) or their Institution(s)Environmental ReviewsDraft
14362 Sun et al. (2015), laccase from T. versicolor was encapsulated within chitosan grafted polyacrylamide hydrogel. 
363 The carrier provided efficient diffusion of target substrates due to its uniformly distributed channels, mesopores, 
364 and macropores. Immobilized laccase showed increased chemical and thermal stability. In batch decolorization 
365 studies, immobilized laccase showed better durability than free laccase even after six cycles. Diverse carriers 
366 have been examined by researchers to amplify the efficiency of laccase in dye degradation. Laccases were 
367 immobilized onto fibrous polymer-grafted polypropylene chloride film, alginate-chitosan microcapsules, 
368 Poly(2-chloroethyl acrylate) grafted zeolite particles, cross-linked magnetic chitosan beads, alumina, silica 
369 beads, green coconut fiber, amino-functionalized poly(vinylamine) microbeads, porous glass beads, 
370 glutaraldehyde-crosslinked chitosan beads, sol-gel matrix based on methyltrimethoxysilane, and 
371 tetramethoxysilane (Zille et al. 2003; Lu et al. 2007; Champagne and Ramsay 2007; Bayramoglu et al. 2010; 
372 Champagne and Ramsay 2010; Cristóvão et al. 2011; Karagoz et al. 2011; Lloret et al. 2011; Celikbicak et al. 
373 2014; Nguyen et al. 2016; Arica et al. 2017). 
374 Tyrosinases are also copper-containing enzymes. They are ubiquitous and can be found in plants, fungi, 
375 bacteria, insects, and mammalian tissues. Their catalytic activity requires O 2 and follows a two-step reaction. In 
376 the first step, monophenol substrates are hydroxylated to ortho-diphenols. In the next step, ortho-diphenols are 
377 oxidized to orthoquinone (Ba and Kumar 2017). The application of immobilized tyrosinases for synthetic dye 
378 removal has been decidedly less studied. Veismoradi et al. (2019) analyzed the dye (Acid Blue 113 and Direct 
379 Black 22) degradation performance of direct contact membrane reactor (DCMR) and immobilized enzyme 
380 membrane reactor (IEMR). Tyrosinase was immobilized onto cross-linked polyacrylonitrile (PAN)/chitosan 
381 composite membrane. Initially, both the reactors accounted for ~95% dye removal. However, upon repeated dye 
382 degradation, IEMR showed remarkable efficiency. After ten cycles of dye decolorization, IEMR maintained its 
383 dye degradation at ~80%, while DCMR catalytic activity dropped to ~60%. Another study conducted by Wu et 
384 al (2001) immobilized tyrosinase in swollen chitosan beads. Chitosan beads exhibited a much faster dye 
385 adsorption capacity when compared to chitosan flakes. Also, tyrosine immobilization was 14 times greater than 
386 chitosan flakes. 
387 Peroxidases are heme-containing enzymes. They are widely found among plants, animals, and 
388 microorganisms (Duarte-Vazquez et al. 2003). Secretory plant and fungal peroxidases belonging to the plant 
389 peroxidase superfamily have been widely used for the treatment of wastewater containing colored dyestuffs. The 
390 common fungal peroxidases immobilized for dye degradation include LiP and MnP. LiP was the first lignin-
391 degrading peroxidase to be discovered. The first step in their catalytic process involves reducing H 2O2, which Page 14 of 74
© The Author(s) or their Institution(s)Environmental ReviewsDraft
15392 leads to the production of an intermediate compound I and an oxoferryl iron porphyrin radical cation. Ferric 
393 (Fe3+) is also oxidized during this step. In the next step, compound I is reduced to compound II and LiP is 
394 returned to the ferric oxidation state (Pollegioni et al. 2015). LiP immobilized in chitosan beads showed efficient 
395 decolorization (~70- 95%) of six reactive dyes. The immobilized LiP exhibited thermostability, reusability, low 
396 Km, and high V max values (Sofia et al. 2016). Similarly, the immobilization of LiP in Ca-alginate beads enhanced 
397 its catalytic activity, thermal stability, and reusability. Further, it efficiently reduced BOD, COD, and TOC 
398 levels in wastewater (Shaheen et al. 2017). LiP, when immobilized on carbon nanotubes, exhibited a remarkable 
399 increase of 18 to 27- fold specific activity when compared to free enzymes. However, only the immobilized 
400 enzyme extracts could be reused; the carbon nanotubes became saturated and had to be discarded over time 
401 (Oliviera et al. 2018). The catalytic reaction of MnP shows many similarities to LiP. It involves preliminary 
402 oxidation of H 2O2 to an intermediary compound, which in turn oxidizes Mn2+ to Mn3+. Mn3+ is stabilized by 
403 organic acids and forms an Mn3+ organic acid complex that acts as the active oxidant for dyes (Hussain 2010). 
404 Several studies have been reported by Bilal et al. (2016a, 2016b, 2016c, 2016d, 2017a) as well as Bilal and 
405 Asgher (2015a, 2015b, 2016) on immobilization of MnP. These studies immobilized MnP using different 
406 carriers as a sol-gel matrix of tetramethoxysilane and propyltrimethoxysilane, polyvinyl alcohol-alginate beads, 
407 Ca-alginate beads, glutaraldehyde activated gelatin matrix, glutaraldehyde activated chitosan beads, and agar-
408 agar. Immobilization using these carriers resulted in enzymes with pH stability, thermal stability, storage 
409 stability, and high catalytic activity. Reusability varied among the different carriers; however, chitosan beads 
410 exhibited the best result. MnP immobilized in chitosan beads retained more than 60% of its catalytic activity 
411 even after ten cycles of batch decolorization studies. Additionally, immobilized MnP reduced BOD, COD, and 
412 TOC of the textile wastewaters. Among the plant peroxidases, HRP has been extensively studied for 
413 immobilization and its possible application in dye degradation. HRP enzymes obtained from horseradish is a 
414 glycoprotein and contains six lysine residues. It is of special interest in biotechnological applications because of 
415 its small molecular weight, stability, and cost-effectiveness (Veitch 2004). HRP can cleave azo dyes in the 
416 presence of H 2O2 as well as degrade and precipitate industrial synthetic dyes (Onder et al. 2011; Çelebi et al. 
417 2013). Zamora et al. (1998) immobilized HRP on Amberlite IRA-400 for remediation of effluent from a paper 
418 and pulp industry. Immobilized HRP decolorized over 50% of the affluent only within 4 h without significant 
419 dye adsorption by the carrier. It was also found that immobilized HRP functioned more efficiently when 
420 combined with a pre-treatment of the effluent's photoirradiation. In another study, the HRP enzyme was 
421 covalently immobilized onto various carriers as Hydroxyl-terminated bisphenol A- and bisphenol AF-based Page 15 of 74
© The Author(s) or their Institution(s)Environmental ReviewsDraft
16422 polysulfones (Celebi et al. 2013). Immobilized HRP presented good decolorization of dyes Acid Black 1 
423 Reactive Blue 19, thermal and storage- stability was also observed. However, immobilization could not impart 
424 the enzyme's pH stability. Kumar et al. (2016) used epoxy functionalized polypropylene (PP) films to 
425 immobilize the HRP enzyme for the degradation of Basic Red 29. Immobilized HRP showed increased storage 
426 capacity, pH stability, and thermostability. It was capable of ~90% dye degradation and could be reused for five 
427 consecutive cycles without any significant loss of activity. Bilal et al. (2018) used a packed bed reactor with 
428 immobilized HRP in polyacrylamide gel to study the degradation of Methyl Orange. Immobilized HRP was able 
429 to achieve >90% dye degradation. It also reduced the toxicity of the parent dye as established from phytotoxicity 
430 assays. Other noteworthy immobilized plant peroxidases applied for dye degradation include bitter gourd 
431 peroxidase immobilized onto Con A-Sephadex and concanavalin A layered calcium alginate–starch beads 
432 (Akhtar et al. 2005; Matto and Hussain 2009a), soybean peroxidase immobilized on silica monolith (Calza et al. 
433 2016), turnip peroxidase on Concanavalin A-wood shaving, and calcium alginate (Matto and Hussain 2009b; 
434 Ahmedi et al. 2015).
435 3. Immobilization of whole cells for dye remediation
436 Whole-cell immobilization evolved as an alternative to enzyme immobilization. Cell immobilization can be 
437 precisely defined as localization or confinement of viable microbial cells within a particular region to restrict 
438 their mobility and carry out catalytic reactions in repeated or continuous mode. The immobilization matrix is 
439 characterized by hydrodynamic features differing from that of the surrounding environment (Dervakos and 
440 Webb 1991; Amim et al. 2010; Gotovtsev et al. 2015). Cell immobilization drew researchers' attention as an 
441 alternative to certain immobilized enzymes since cell immobilization eliminates the laborious and expensive 
442 process of enzyme isolation and purification. Initially, immobilized bacterial cells found application in many 
443 fields. Eventually, filamentous fungi, algae, and yeasts were also immobilized (Anderson 1975; Šíma et al. 
444 2017; Basak et al. 2019; Abou-El-Souod et al. 2020). Cell immobilization has certain advantages over enzyme 
445 immobilization: elimination of the long and expensive procedures of enzyme isolation and purification, 
446 elimination of biocatalyst refill since immobilized microbial cells can be operated in the continuous or semi-
447 continuous production process, efficient recovery of the biocatalyst, provides a more extended period of enzyme 
448 activity and storage since they remain in their natural cellular environment, and eliminates strain genetic 
449 instability problems associated with recombinant strains (Dincbas et al. 1993; Junter and Jouene 2004; Page 16 of 74
© The Author(s) or their Institution(s)Environmental ReviewsDraft
17450 Stolarzewicz et al. 2011; Bouabidi et al. 2019). The numerous advantages of immobilized cell systems have led 
451 to their increasing application in wastewater treatment.  
452 Biodegradation of dyes has been studied extensively by scientists over the years. Many 
453 microorganisms including bacteria (Anjaneya et al. 2011; Jadhav et al. 2011), fungi (Tapia-Tussell et al. 2011; 
454 Cano et al. 2012; Sen et al. 2012), algae (Omar et al. 2008; El-Sheekh et al. 2009), yeasts (Charumathi and Das 
455 2010; Waghmode et al. 2011), actinomycetes (Mane et al., 2008), and microbial consortia (Ndasi et al. 2011; 
456 Waghmode et al. 2011) have been applied for this purpose. Although extensive studies on dye biodegradation 
457 have been performed with suspended free cells, the scope of immobilized cells in dye degradation has been less 
458 explored. The application of immobilized cells for dye biodegradation studies began in the late 1980s with 
459 bacteria (Wagner and Hempel 1988). Since then, immobilization studies have been performed using bacteria, 
460 fungi, and algae (Das and Adholeya 2015). Comparatively fewer studies are reported on yeast (Mitter and Corso 
461 2013; Dastagir and Padma 2014; Tan et al. 2014a, 2014b). 
462 The application of immobilized bacteria is an essential aspect in the field of azo dye biodegradation. 
463 Several reports suggest that immobilized bacteria are more beneficial and efficient compared to free suspended 
464 cells. Tuttolomondo et al. (2014) reported that sol-gel immobilized Pseudomonas sp. was able to produce seven 
465 times more extracellular dye degrading enzymes while protecting bacteria from the aggressive external 
466 surroundings, and maintained a high dye decolorization percentage (nearly 80%), even after four cycles of 
467 reuse. Immobilized cells of Enterobacter agglomerans in a calcium alginate matrix maintained its dye 
468 decolorization rate over 95% even after seven cycles of repeated batch decolorization (Moutaouakkil et al. 
469 2004). Chang et al. (2001) examined three different immobilization matrices (calcium alginate, carrageenan, and 
470 polyacrylamide) for immobilizing P. luteola. When compared to free cells, immobilized P. luteola showed 
471 stability under various levels of pH, and dissolved oxygen, and maintained its activity after repeated usage for 
472 up to four cycles. Free cells showed a higher specific decolorization rate, but immobilization would achieve a 
473 higher total decolorization rate since it increased the biomass concentration. It has been reported earlier that 
474 bacterial dye degradation is more likely to occur under anaerobic conditions but leads to the production of 
475 aromatic amines. Anaerobic degradation is often followed by aerobic degradation to mineralize these amines 
476 (Shah et al. 2013). Reports using this strategy in immobilization are scarce. (Kudlich et al. 1996) entrapped 
477 Sphingomonas sp. BN6 in alginate beads to biodegrade the azo dye Mordant Yellow 3 (MY3). Under aerobic 
478 conditions, immobilized cells formed more than equimolar amounts of a 5-aminosalicylate and almost 
479 negligible amount of 6-aminonaphthalene-2-sulfonate (6A2NS). Bacterial cells in the anaerobic center of the Page 17 of 74
© The Author(s) or their Institution(s)Environmental ReviewsDraft
18480 alginate beads reduced MY3 to 6A2NS and 5-aminosalicylate. Further, 6A2NS was oxidized to 5-
481 aminosalicylate in the outer aerobic zones of the beads, which were then released in the medium. Also, 
482 Sphingomonas sp. BN6 was co-immobilized with an aerobic 5-aminosalicylate degrading strain led to the 
483 complete mineralization of MY3. Another study was conducted by Hameed and Ismail (2020) for investigating 
484 the biodegradation potential of immobilized mixed cells against Reactive Yellow 15 (RY 15) using a sequential 
485 anaerobic-aerobic process in bench-scale as well as lab-scale bioreactors. Mixed cells were obtained from 
486 activated sludge and were immobilized using three types of carriers (alginate, gelatin, and starch) and cross-
487 linked using polyvinyl alcohol. Immobilized cells showed a better biodegradation potential in both the aerobic 
488 and anaerobic phases at increased dye concentrations and showed excellent reusability with the same dye 
489 removal potential in the two cycles of reuse.  
490 Fungi are highly effective in breaking down synthetic dyes (Cuoto 2009). They yield an assortment of 
491 extracellular proteins, organic acids, and other metabolites, which helps them adapt to adverse environmental 
492 conditions (Das and Adholeya 2015). Much consideration has been given to the potential of fungal systems in 
493 dye decolorization. Fungi can be used for bioremediation by either utilizing the biomass as a sorbent or by 
494 utilizing the biodegradation/ biotransformation enzymes produced by fungi. Biosorption has been mostly 
495 practiced with non-ligninolytic fungi. White rot fungi have been extensively studied for dye degradation. 
496 Pazarlioglu et al. (2005) immobilized white-rot fungi P. chrysosporium on ZrOCl 2 activated pumice for direct 
497 azo dye degradation. The decolorization ratio for the dyes decreased with the use of immobilized fungi but 
498 maintained a high degradation efficiency (100- 95%) even after four cycles of repeated batch decolorization 
499 studies. Another white-rot fungus T. hirsuta was immobilized on calcium alginate and operated in an airlift 
500 bioreactor (Domı´nguez et al. 2005). Dye decolorization was performed in batch mode in the bioreactor and 
501 continued for 40 days without any disruption of the bioparticles. High dye decolorization was attained at short 
502 duration, indicating the stability of this process. Dichotomous squalene, when immobilized on pinewood, 
503 resulted in increased laccase production, thereby leading to decolorization of anthraquinone dye Remazol 
504 Brilliant Blue R and an azo dye Reactive Orange 16 (Šušla et al. 2007). Other fungi immobilized for dye 
505 degradation include T. pubescens and Pleurotus ostreatus on polyurethane foam (Casieri et al. 2008), 
506 Aspergillus flavus SA2 on sand particles (Andleeb et al. 2012), T. versicolor  ATCC 20869 on various natural 
507 and synthetic carriers as wheat straw, jute, hemp, maple woodchips, and nylon and polyethylene terephthalate 
508 fibers, alginate beads (Shin et al. 2002; Pazarlioglu et al. 2010), Irpex lacteus on polyurethane foam (Tavčar et 
509 al. 2006), and Funalia trogii on calcium alginate (Park et al. 2006).Page 18 of 74

19510 Algae/ microalgae have been immobilized and used for various biotechnological applications for over 
511 40 years. The extremely high accumulation ability of certain algal species for hazardous pollutants have led to 
512 their application in the field of bioremediation. In the majority of cases, algae have benefited from 
513 immobilization. Immobilization prevented grazing by aggressive zooplankton; the competition for nutrition with 
514 other microbial species is reduced; improved metabolism and function have been observed (de-Bashan et al. 
515 2010). In most studies of algal immobilization for dye degradation, the biomass was entrapped in alginate beads. 
516 Chlorella pyrenoidosa was immobilized in alginate beads. Immobilization increased algal growth and 
517 physiological activity. For example, it was found that there was greater dye decolorization compared to free 
518 algae and decolorization was increased further when supplied with bubbling air containing 2% CO 2 (Guolan et 
519 al. 2000). Mona et al. (2011) immobilized the spent biomass of Nostoc linckia in calcium alginate for the 
520 biosorption of Reactive Red 198. Immobilized biomass showed a good absorption of dye concentrations 100-
521 500 mg L-1. Microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii immobilized on polysulfone nanofibrous web decolorized 
522 Reactive Black 5 and Reactive Blue 221 (Keskin et al. 2015). Immobilized microalgae maintained its 
523 decolorization at approximately 51% after the third cycle of batch decolorization. Green algae Desmodesmus sp. 
524 immobilized in alginate beads showed maximum decolorization of Methylene Blue and Malachite Green 
525 compared to free cells (Al-Fawwaz and Abdullah 2016). Few researchers reported comparative studies with 
526 different carriers of algal immobilization for dye degradation. For example, Chu et al. (2009) used κ-
527 carrageenan and sodium alginate for immobilization. Alginate immobilized algal cells achieved maximum dye 
528 decolorization of textile wastewater. Similar results were obtained by Kassim et al. (2018) where Chlorella sp. 
529 was immobilized in three different carriers (starch, carboxymethyl cellulose, and alginate). The highest 
530 decolorization of effluent was achieved with alginate. Other immobilized algae entrapped in sodium alginate 
531 and used for dye degradation include Scenedesmus quadricauda, S. obliquus , Chlorella sp., C. vulgaris 
532 UMACC 001, Phormidium sp. (Ertuğrul et al. 2008; Chia et al. 2014; Kumar et al. 2014a; Revathi et al. 2017; 
533 Abou-El-Souod et al. 2020; Wu et al. 2020).
534 Many researchers have pointed out that the use of pure microbial culture for industrial dye degradation 
535 would be ineffective. Pure cultures often degrade dye, which leads to the production of aromatic amines and 
536 other toxic products. Also, individual strains are only effective against a particular type of dye. Industrial 
537 wastewaters have a complex chemical composition which necessitates the use of several enzymatic reactions 
538 (Solís et al. 2012). This led to a culmination of researchers utilizing microbial consortia to search for more 
539 practical approaches in dye degradation. Chen et al. (2003a) immobilized a microbial consortium obtained from Page 19 of 74

20540 the sludge sample of a wastewater treatment plant in PVA gel beads. The immobilized consortium showed 
541 efficient decolorization of azo dye Red RBN and maintained decolorization ability even at high dye 
542 concentrations. Further, the beads exhibited sufficient stability and were capable of application for six months. 
543 The immobilized consortium had a remarkable ability to decolorize various other azo dyes as well as dye 
544 mixtures. In another study, a microbial consortium consisting of a fungus and a bacterium was immobilized in 
545 PVA for degradation of Direct Fast Scarlet 4BS (Fang et al. 2004). The immobilized consortium showed 
546 optimum activity at a broad temperature and pH range and showed efficient decolorization of the dye at a high 
547 concentration of 1000 mg L-1. Further, it had an excellent reusability property. The immobilized consortium 
548 sustained 30 cycles of batch decolorization without losing its efficiency. Lade et al. (2015) constituted a 
549 microbial consortium from the wastewater disposal site of textile effluent and immobilized it in polyurethane 
550 foam. The immobilized consortium not only showed complete degradation of Congo Red but also degraded 
551 92% of real textile wastewater. Similarly, Kurade et al. (2019) immobilized a microbial consortium on stainless 
552 steel sponge. The immobilized consortium was capable of approximately 90% decolorization of the textile 
553 effluent. The decolorization efficiency was maintained above 90% even after three cycles of decolorization. 
554 Many recent research strategies have focused on the use of microbial consortium over individual cultures (Patel 
555 and Gupte 2015; Yin et al. 2017; Hameed and Ismail 2018; Hameed and Ismail 2020).
556
557 Comparative Assessment of Immobilized Biocatalysts for Industrial Applications
558 Real industrial dye-laden wastewater contains a myriad of chemicals and dye mixtures. They are characterized 
559 as being hazardous due to their intense color, high COD contributed by the dyes (20%) and auxiliary dyeing 
560 agents (80%), and their complex chemical constitution. Hence it is important to examine the degradation 
561 potential of real wastewater to determine the applicability of immobilized systems. Another critical parameter 
562 for industrial application is the ability to treat large volumes of wastewater. Table 3 presents a brief overview of 
563 the potential industrial applications of different immobilized systems. Studies that tested the potential of 
564 biocatalysts for effluent removal or utilized bioreactors for color removal were considered. Only a few studies 
565 have tested the potential of immobilized biocatalysts for effluent color removal in bioreactors. Immobilized 
566 microbial consortia showed more potential for industrial applications (Lade et al. 2015; Kurade et al. 2019; 
567 Hameed and Ismail 2020). The concoction of microorganisms in a consortium probably provides a combination 
568 of enzymes that is suitable for treating the dye mixtures in an effluent. However, the presence of different 
569 microorganisms makes the process unreliable and difficult to control. Several studies were undertaken on the Page 20 of 74

21570 development of novel carriers for enzyme immobilization but its potential for industrial application has been 
571 less explored. The high specificity of an enzymatic process makes these biocatalysts relatively unlikely for 
572 effluent treatment. Studies performed with enzymes like laccase in bioreactors for effluent treatment resulted in 
573 lower dye decolorization properties when compared to results using single dyes (Sondhi et al. 2018; Katuri et al. 
574 2009). This hurdle can be overcome by using the co-immobilization of enzymes for effluent treatment. Selecting 
575 a reactor for immobilized systems is essential in making effluent treatment cost-effective and efficient. An 
576 efficient bioreactor should possess optimum fluid dynamic conditions, effective mass, and heat transfer to and 
577 from the bioreactor surface. Other factors such as the intensity of shear stress, flow, and mixing outlines are also 
578 crucial, especially for immobilized cells. The majority of the studies performed by researchers have utilized 
579 anaerobic/microaerophilic reactors. A few studies utilized aerobic reactors such as rotating biological 
580 contractors and airlift reactors. In most cases, aerobic reactors suffer from auto-oxidation and reaction with 
581 compounds of sludge matrix which hinders the dye degradation process. Researchers mostly reported the use of 
582 packed bed reactors for effluent treatment with immobilized systems (Senan et al. 2003; Manikandan et al. 
583 2009; Lang et al. 2013; Torres-Farradá et al. 2018). 
584
585 Conclusions
586 Environmental deterioration poses significant challenges for researchers to find effective treatment technology 
587 to combat pollution from various dye utilizing industries. The generation of colored effluents from various 
588 industries is a significant contributor to the growing worldwide water crisis. Preliminary studies have already 
589 revealed the potential of various bioremediating agents to control dye pollution. Immobilization is an efficient 
590 way to enhance the potential of these agents for treating large-scale dyestuff containing wastewater. A crucial 
591 step in successful immobilization is the choice of carriers for a particular biocatalyst. The application for 
592 wastewater treatment necessitates the development of carriers that have characteristics such as: 1) 
593 inexpensiveness, 2) biocompatibility, 3) mechanical and chemical stability, 4) porosity with optimum diffusion 
594 rate, and 5) high surface area. Hence, researchers should focus on carrier development extensively. Another 
595 difficulty in choosing a carrier is the generation of varied results among researchers using the same carrier. 
596 Thus, it is necessary to standardize the use of carriers in terms of their physical and chemical properties, purity, 
597 composition, and source reproducibility. Another key point to successful immobilization is the method of 
598 immobilization. Current studies are based on developing a particular method of immobilization by screening the 
599 biocatalysts; hence, most biocatalysts function below optimum operating conditions. It is necessary to design the Page 21 of 74

22600 immobilization method with consideration given to the biocatalyst, the carrier, and the application. 
601 Immobilization was initially performed with enzymes, and ever since, many studies have been conducted to 
602 examine its potential for dye degradation. Cellular immobilization is a relatively new technology and has been 
603 less researched in comparison to enzymes. Immobilized enzymes are often preferred over intact cells owing to 
604 their high specificity, ease in activity optimization, effortless handling, and ease of storage. The majority of 
605 research articles have studied laccase immobilization, followed by fungal and plant peroxidases for dye 
606 degradation. The main reason for their widespread application is their low specificity making them adept at 
607 degrading a wide range of dyestuffs such as azo, heterocyclic, and polymeric dyes. The significant advantages 
608 of applying cellular immobilization over enzymes are the lower bioprocessing cost, The broader spectrum of 
609 activity of these multi-enzyme systems, and their comparatively extended duration of function and storage. 
610 Lignin degrading white-rot fungi were extensively studied for immobilization and their broad spectrum of 
611 activity holds much potential in dye degradation. The vast and interesting research on the immobilization of 
612 cells and enzymes has helped establish the efficiency of immobilization systems over free biocatalysts due to 
613 increasing their physical, chemical, storage-stability, reusability, and enhanced catalytic activity. However, the 
614 application of large-scale wastewater treatment technology is still in its infancy. Only a few research articles 
615 have explored the potential of immobilized systems for real industrial effluent. Experimental biotreatment 
616 research must focus on the capacity and function of these systems to handle the massive volume of industrial 
617 effluents over longer periods so that these methods may be commercially feasible.

© The Author(s) or their Institution(s)Environmental ReviewsDraftTable 1. Comparative analysis of the different immobilization techniques
Technique Advantages Disadvantages
1. Adsorption Mild technique
Eliminates the use of chemical additives
Simplicity in operation
Less time consuming
Reversibility which allows for purification 
of the biocatalyst and reloading of the 
support
The active site of the enzyme is unaltered
Cost-effective
Eco-friendlyHeavy leakage of enzyme or cells 
from the carrier due to weak 
binding forces
Interactions involved between the 
biocatalyst and the carrier are 
unstable
Loading cannot be controlled
Steric hindrance by the carrier
Low reproducibility
2. Covalent Binding Improves catalytic activity
Strong bond formation between biocatalyst 
and the carrier.
Elimination of desorption or leakage 
problems.
Improved thermal stability
Ease in substrate contact
Comparatively simpler in operation
Cost-effectiveThe usage of toxic coupling 
agents leads to loss of cell 
viability or enzyme activity.
Biocatalyst loading occurs only in 
small amounts (0.02 g per g of 
carrier)
Can be costly as some of the good 
supports are expensive (eg. 
Eupergit  C  and  Agaroses)
3. Cross-linking or 
CopolymerisationCarrier free immobilization
Better application when used in 
conjunction with other methods
Stability increases as enzyme molecules or 
cells are cross-linked resulting in a rigid 
structure
Simpler operationUsage of polyfunctional agents 
can denature biocatalyst thereby 
resulting in loss of enzyme 
activity.Page 53 of 74
© The Author(s) or their Institution(s)Environmental ReviewsDraftCost-effective
4. Entrapment Rapid and a versatile method
Protection from external harsh conditions
Enzyme loading can be very high
Mild conditions required during the 
reaction process
InexpensivePossibility of cellular and enzyme 
leakage from the matrix
Deactivation during 
immobilization
Limited substrate accessibility 
and reduced electron transport
Injury of the carrier during usage
5. Encapsulation Protection of biocatalyst from external 
harsh conditions
No leakage issues
An inexpensive and simple method
Core material does not require any 
chemical modification hence the activity 
of biocatalyst is unharmed
Co-immobilization is possible. Biocatalyst 
can be immobilized in any desired 
combinationDamage to the capsule by 
growing cells
Damage to capsule due to product 
build-up from enzyme reactions
Hardly used for ex-situ 
bioremediationPage 54 of 74
