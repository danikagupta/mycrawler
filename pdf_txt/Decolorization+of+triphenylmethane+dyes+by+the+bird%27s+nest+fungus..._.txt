ABSTRACT  
Six triphenylmethane dyes viz., bromophenol blue, 
basic fuchsin, methyl violet, methyl green, ethyl violet and malachite green were studied for their decolorization by Fomitopsis feei. Among, basic 
fuchsin (98%) was maximum decolorized follow- ed by bromophenol blue (96.8%). However, the rate of bromophenol blue decolorization was very fast. There was no correlation between the lig- nolytic activity and dye decolurization of the dyes. The highest laccase and lignin peroxidase ac- tivities were observed in basic fuchsin (46 U/mL) and methyl green (44 U/mL) respectively after 21 days of incubation, which were poor dye degrad- ers. The triphenylmethane reductase enzyme was the responsible enzyme for the decolorization of these triphenyl methane dyes. The treatment by using fungal organisms was considered to be the cost-effective and ecofriendly method of de- colourization of effluents discharged from the dye industries.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Synthetic dyes are extensively used in the textile in- 
dustries and significant proportion appears in the form of wastewater and is spilled into the environment. More than 10,000 synthetic dyes include the azo, anthroquino- ne and triphenylmethane dyes, all of which are generally considered as the xenobiotic compounds, which are very 
recalcitrant to biodegradation [1]. Triphenylmethane dyes 
are aromatic xenobiotic compounds that are used exten- sively in many industrial processes, such as textile dye- 
ing, paper printing, and food and cosmetic manufacture 
[2]. They are known to be highly toxic to mammalian 
cells and mutagenic and carcinogenic to humans [3-6]. Based on their potential for adverse human health effects, 
most countries have nominated triphenylmethane dyes as 
hazardous material and proh ibited the use of them in 
aquaculture and food industry. However, they are still 
used in some areas due to their relatively low cost, ready 
availability and efficacy [7 ]. Since triphenylmethane dyes 
occur as contaminants and potential human health haz- 
ards, there is concern about th e fate of them in aquatic 
and terrestrial ecosystems [8,9]. Considerable amounts of 
these toxic and mutagenic dyes are discharged into waste- 
water treatment facilities and thus impose a selective 
pressure on the microbial fl ora residing in wastewater 
habitats. Several physicochemical methods include ad-
sorption, chemical precipitation and flocculation, photo- 
lysis, chemical oxidation an d reduction, electrochemical 
treatment and ion pair extraction have been used to eli- 
minate the colored effluents from wastewater [10] but 
these methods are expensive, of limited applicability and 
produce large amounts of sludge. As a better alternative, 
therefore, the development of  biological processes using 
microorganisms for the treatment of dye-containing waste- 
water has become increasingly important.  
Several triphenylmethane dye-decolorizing microor- 
ganisms have been reported and their characteristics were reviewed [11]. Only a few studies have reported the 
bioremoval potentials of brown rot fungi for different 
dyes [12-17]. Further research work on such fungal strains is much needed in bioremediation perspective. Fomitop- 
sis feei  is a basidiomyceteous fungi belongs to the family 
Fomitopsidaeceae. Brown rot fungus F . feei  has been 
found to have decolorization capacity but only limited 
literature is available [18]. The present work was aimed 
at evaluating basidiomycetous fungi for its ability to de-

colorize several synthetic dyes in shake condition. An 
attempt has also been made to analyze the concomitant association of ligninolytic enzymes (lignin peroxidase and laccase) production during the decolorization by this 
fungus. 
2. MATERIAL AND METHODS 
2.1. Chemicals  
Triphenyl methane dyes i.e. Basic fuchsin (BF), Me- 
thyl green (MetG), Ethyl violet (EV), Methyl violet (MV) 
were procured from Hi Media Laboratories Pvt. Ltd. 
(Mumbai, India) and Malachite green (MG) and Bromo- phenol blue (BB) were purchased from Merck Speciali- 
ties Private Limited (Mumbai, India) and Qualigens Fine 
Chemicals Ltd. (Mumbai, India) respectively. All media components and chemicals used were of highest purity 
grade.  
2.2. Isolation of Microorganism and Culture 
Conditions  
The wood decaying fungus F . feei  was collected  
from the infected wood logs at Pakhal forest (latitude 18˚1
'18.82 ''N and longitude 80 ˚9'22.16 ''E) Warangal dis- 
trict, Andhra Pradesh, Indi a. The tentatively identified 
fungus was phylogenetically confirmed by molecular analysis of D2 region of 28S rDNA as Fomitopsis feei  
(AY 515327.1). All along the duration of the experiment, 
fungus was maintained on Malt extract agar medium 
(MEA (g/L): Malt extract 15, Dipotassium hydrogen 
phosphate 1, Ammonium chloride 1, 1 N Citric acid 15 mL; Agar 20) and stored at 4 ˚C and sub cultured every 
fortnight. 
2.3. Decolorization in Liquid Media 
For this basidiomycetous fungus, decolorization was 
tested in a 100-mL Erlenmeyer  flask with 25 mL  sterile 
production broth (g/L): Peptone—1, Yeast extract—2, 
Dipotassium hydrogen phosphate—1, Magnesium sul-phate hepta hydrate—0.2, Ammonium sulphate—5, Glu- cose—20 and pH—6.0, contai ning 0.001% each triphe- 
nyl methane dye. Flasks were inoculated with single 10 mm diameter fungal disk taken from the periphery of the 7-day-old fungal culture in MEA plate and incubated at 28˚C in shaking incubator at 150 rpm speed. After regu- 
lar intervals include 7, 14 and 21 days of incubation, the fungal culture was harvested by filtering through What- man No.1 filter paper and the culture filtrate was centri- fuged (12,000 × g; 20 min) at 4 ˚C. Decolorization and 
ligninolytic enzymes activity was determined from the cell-free supernatant. pH of the supernatant was meas- ured every time using Elico pH meter. The uninoculated dye-containing medium was used as control. The decol- orization efficiency was determined using the following equation [19]:

iniA Initial absorbance =  
finA Final absorbance of dye after incubation time. =  
2.4. Dry Mycelium Weight  
Dry mycelium weight (DMW) of the fungal mass was 
obtained by filtering the contents of each flask through pre-weighed Whatmann No.1 filter paper and then it was left to dry to a constant weight at 70 ˚C. DMW was ex- 
pressed in terms of grams of biomass per liter of culture. 
2.5. Lignolytic Enzyme Assays  
Laccase activity was measured [20] by taking the 
optical density of reaction mixture, prepared by mixing 0.5 mL of distilled water, 1 mL of sodium acetate buffer 
(pH 4.5), 0.5 mL of substrate solution (46 mM guaiacol) to 0.5 mL of crude enzyme (cell free supernatant) at 440 nm up to 90 sec with 30 sec of time interval. Lignin per-oxidase
 activity was evaluated [21] by following the 
same procedure of laccase but 0.5 mL of hydrogen per-oxide was added in addition to that mixture. For these two enzymes, one activity unit was defined as the amount of enzyme necessary to oxidize one μmol of sub- 
strate per minute. 
2.6. Triphenylmethane Reductase (TMR) 
Assay 
The standard assay [22] system for TMR comprised 
250 μL of 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 250 
μL of 20 μ M basic fuchsin, 250 μL of 0.1 mM NADH, 
and 250 μL of the enzyme in a total volume of 1 mL. 
Each reaction was initiated by the addition of the enzyme, and the initial reaction rate wa s determined by monitor- 
ing the decrease in absorbance at 544 nm in the first 2 min in a temperature-controlled cuvette in a 1.0-cm light path at 40 ˚C. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as 
the amount that cataly zed the reduction of 1 μmol of ba- 
sic fuchsin per min per mL. The corresponding wave- lengths were used when other triphenylmethane dyes were tested in place of basic fuchsin.

 M
aximum decolorization with F . feei  was observed in 
basic fuchsin after 21 days of incubation (98%) followed 
by bromophenol blue (96.8%). The rate of bromophenol 
blue decolorization was very fast ( Figure 1 ) may be due 
to the less complex structure of bromophenol blue com- 
pared to the other two dyes tested. The rate of decolori- 
zation in basic fuchsin (Figure  2) was increased from 
73.8% (7 days) to 98% (21 days). 85.3% of decoloriza- 
tion was observed in methyl violet ( Figure  3) after 7 
days of incubation, which was then increased to 91.5% 
after 21 days of incubation. Although the initial decol- 
orization of methyl green ( Figure  4) was less in 7 days 
(34.2%), it could reach upto 88.3% after 21 days of in- 
cubation but there was no laccase activitiy. However, it is 
strange that the decolorization of ethyl violet ( Figure  5) 
was increased from 63% to 83% from 7 to 21 days with- 
out showing laccase activity. There was no much differ- 
ence in the rate of decolo rization of malachite green 
(Figure  6) viz. 81.8%, 85.1% and 89.6% in 7, 14 and 21 
days respectively. From these results, it is revealed that the percentage of decolorization was increased with in- 
cubation time ( Figure  7). Figure 1. Decolorization of bromophenol blue by Fomitopsis

4. DISCUSSION  
There are very few reports on the biological decolori- zation and degradation of textile and dye-stuff industrial wastes containing triphenylmethane dyes. All the reports so far available are on a sm all scale. Triphenylmethane 
dyes have been reported to undergo extensive biodegra- dation by ligninolytic cultures of P . chrysosporium [23, 
24]. The structural genes encoding lignin peroxidase and laccase have been cloned and characterized [25,26]. The biochemical mechanism underlying the decolorization of triphenylmethane dyes has been elucidated in fungi [11]. Several species of fungi ar e known to decolorize tri- 
phenylmethane dyes by a variety of enzymes as laccase [27] lignin peroxidase [24,28]. After 18 days Lentinula 
(Lentinus ) edodes  completely decolo rized methyl green, 
methyl violet, ethyl violet [29]. 
Ollika et al. [30] purified iso-enzymes of lignin per- 
oxidases from P . chrysosporium and studied the decol- 
orization efficiencies for se veral dyes including azo and 
triphenylmethane dyes. Synthetic dyes crystal violet and

malachite green s howed 100% and 90% of decoloriza- 
tion on the PDA media [31]. In liquid culture, P. calyp- 
tratus  was able to decolorize crystal violet and malachite 
green during 14 days of cultivation in Kirk medium after 
14 days the extents of decolorization were only 5 and 
27% of the dye, respectively [32]. Decolorization of tri- phenylmethane dyes (crystal violet, bromophenol blue 
and malachite green) by three birds nest fungi— Cyathus 
bulleri , C. stercoreus , C. striatus was reported [27]. Among 
the three organisms, C. buleri was found to be the most 
efficient in decolorization.  
Particularly, the usefulness of the brown rot fungi for 
decolorization of wastewater ha s not been probed at all. 
Polyporus ostreiformis  produced lignin peroxidase along 
with manganese peroxidase, acid protease, a-amylase in 
nitrogen-limited liquid media for decolorization [33]. 
Studies with the brown-rot fungi Gloeophyllum trabeum  
and Fomitopsis pinicola  on liquid media revealed no 
lignin peroxidase or manganese-dependent peroxidase activity, although nonspecific peroxidase activity was de- 
tected [34]. No induction in  laccase, lignin peroxidase 
and tyrosinase activity was observed during decoloriza- 
tion process and significant induction in malachite green 
reductase (73%) activities were observed during decol- orization of malachite green by K. rosea  [35]. An enzyme 
that decolorizes triphenylmet hane dyes is designated 
triphenylmethane reductase (TMR) purified from Citro- 
bacter sp. strain KCTC 18061P and characterized, cloned 
of the gene encoding this enzyme and its heterologous expression in Escherichia coli  was reported by [22]. 
From our results also it is confirmed that triphenyl 
methane reductase enzyme play s specific role in the de- 
colorization process compared to lignolytic enzymes. But 
lignolytic enzyme production was also supported that 
they might be definitely useful in the degradation process. In contrast to the previous research [18] in which methyl green was not decolorized by F . feei , our result showed 
the decolorization of methyl green upto 88.3%. In their 
research they reported that bromophenol blue was decol- orized upto 64.8% but in our present research it was de- colorized upto 96.8% after 21 days of incubation period. This difference might be in days of incubation and the concentration of dye used. Our findings could contribute to a better knowledge of the properties of F . feei , which 
has as yet not been studied in detail and its decoloriza- tion abilities could be promising for further biotechno- logical applications. 
5. CONCLUSION 
It may be concluded from the result that it is possible 
to decolorize or degrade triphenylmethane dyes by biolo- gical means. Biological treatment is the only way for ultimate controlling of pollution generated by textile and dye-stuff industries. Fungal decolorization is a promising alternative to replace or supplement present treatment processes. In conclusion, our results showed that F . feei  
is able to decolorize efficiently several synthetic dyes belonging to triphenylmethane group.
