Introduction  
 
The environmental problems created by the 
textile  industry have received increased 
attention for several decades; the textile 
industry is one of the largest generations of 
contaminated effluents (Solis et al.,  2012). 
The discharge of dyes containing effluents 
in to the environment is of great concerned 
due to colour, toxicity, mutagenicity and 
carcinogenicity of dyes. Textile dyes have 
always been considered in the context of   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recalcitrant xenobiotic compounds in water 
and soil ecology (Daneshwar et al.,  2007; 
Dafale et al.,  2010)  
 
Reactive dyes  consist of a chromophoric 
system (e.g azo, anthraquinone, 
phthalocyanine), the anchor groups and the 
group which increases the water solubility 
(mostly –SO 3-). The decolorization of International Journal of Current Microbiology and Applied Sciences

A bacterial strain, B12, proficient in decolourizing commercial dye - Reactive Blue 
160 (RB160) was isolated from the soil sample collected from a textile industry. 
Phenotypic characterization and phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rDNA sequen ce 
indicated that the bacterial strain belonged to the genus Microbacterium . Bacterial 
isolate B12 showed 96% decolourization of RB160 at the concentration of 250 
mg/l under   microaerobic conditions with temperature 35 ± 2°C  and pH 5.0 in 24 
h.  The decol ourization efficiency of isolate B12 was improved by using physical 
and chemical mutagens, the mutant strain offered 12 h reduction in time required 
for the complete decolourization by wild strain when exposed to 30 sec of UV 
radiation and 0.5µg/ml of acri dine orange. The laccase and reductase enzymes 
cleaved RB160 and metabolised the degraded product, the different intermediates 
were identified using HPLC and LC -MS.  The phytotoxicity studies confirmed that 
intact RB160 was more toxic than dye degraded int ermediates. Microbacterium sp . 
B12 was found competent to degrade RB160 containing textile industry effluents 
showing the usefulness of the organism for possible commercial application.  K ey w o rd s

 reactive dyes results in destroying the 
chromophoric system, and formatio n of 
toxic/nontoxic byproduct (Bansal et al.,  
2012). The toxic byproduct must be properly 
treated before disposing into the 
environment. Advanced oxidation methods 
such as sonolysis, fenton oxidation, 
ozonation, photochemical oxidation and 
electrochemical destruction are available for 
the treatment of dye containing effluents but 
biodegradation is considered as an economic 
one compared to the above mentioned 
processes (Dos Sontos et al.,  2007).  The use 
of microbes that possess the ability to 
decolourize syn thetic dyes including 
bacterial strains and fungi (Liu et al.,  2004; 
Hadibarata et al.,  2011a; Hadibarata et al.,  
2012b).  
 
For decolourization and degradation many 
techniques are practiced that includes bio -
engineering of organisms. The technique, 
like, ra ndom mutagenesis, is used to induce 
mutation in organisms for better 
distinctiveness (Sandesh et al.,  2008). 
Mutagens such as UV irradation, Acridine 
orange are employed for inducing mutation 
(Chandra et al.,  2008 and Chen et al.,  2001). 
Improvement of the  microbial strain by 
subjecting the genetic material to physical 
and chemical mutagenic agents offers 
furthermost opportunity for cost reduction 
without significant capital outlay (Stanbury 
et al.,  1995; Lofty et al., ; 2007).  
 
The genus Microbacterium  was described 
by Orla -Jensen (1919) and comprises a 
diverse collection of yellow pigmented gram 
positive, nonspore forming rods that were 
isolated from various environmental habitats 
like soil, water and steep liquor (Young et 
al., 2010).  Microbacterium amylol yticum  sp. 
nov., isolated from soil from an industrial 
waste (Anand et al.,  2012).   At present, the 
genus Microbacterium  comprises 83 species 
(www.bacterio.cict.fr/m/microbacterium.ht
ml). Reac tive dye Blue 160 is a diazo 
commercial dye, commonly used for dyeing 
cotton, viscose, flex and jute but not suitable 
for silk, polyesters and wool. Very few 
studies on the decolourization and 
degradation of B160 have been reported.  
 
In the present study, we first time report the 
use of Microbacterium  sp. B12 for the 
decolourization and degradation of a 
Reactive Blue 160 . Effect of physico -
chemical  parameters such as temperature, 
pH and agitation has been investigated to 
optimize the dye decolourization.  T he 
mutagenesis approach has been made to 
improve the efficiency of the 
decolourization by using UV irradiation and 
acridine orange mutagenes.  Used LC -MS 
techniques to identify various intermediates.  
Furthermore the toxicity of the dyes both 
before and afte r the treatment with 
Microbacterium sp. B12 was evaluated by 
utilizing Phaseolus aureus  seeds as a 
bioindicator.  
 
Materials and Method s 
 
Dyes, chemical and media     
 
Diazo dye Reactive Blue 160 (RB160) (C.I. 
No. 137160) was procured from the 
Ahmadabad dy eing and printing industry, 
Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India. NADH was 
purchased from Sigma Chemical Company 
(USA). Nutrient broth was obtained from 
HiMedia Laboratory, India. All the 
chemicals used in the study were of 
analytical grade.  
 
Strain Isolation and Cul ture Condition     
 
Microorganisms used in this study were 
isolated from the soil samples of textile 
industry in Ahmadabad, Gujarat. The soil 
sample was added 1% w/v in nutrient broth 
containing RB160 250 mg/l and incubated at Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2016) 5(3): 534-547 
536 
 32±2°C temperature under micr oaerobic as 
well as aerobic conditions at 150 rpm 
conditions. After 24 h of incubation, 1.0ml 
of the culture was serially diluted and 0.1ml 
was withdrawn from 10-5 dilutions  and 
inoculated by spread plate method on the 
nutrient agar plates containing 250 m g/l 
RB160. After 24 h of incubation at optimum 
temperature, the colonies were screened for 
their ability to form a clear zone around 
them. The selected colony with highest zone 
size was selected, isolated and subculture in 
nutrient broth containing 250mg/l  RB160. 
Morphological and biochemical test were 
carried out to identify the selected organism.  
 
Identification of Bacterial Isolate     
 
Bacterial cells of strain B12 were collected 
by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 10 min and 
subjected to sequential dige stion by 
lysozyme of 2.5 mg/l, 37 °C for 1 h and 
proteinase K was 20 mg/l in 1% SDS, 55 °C 
for 1 h, followed by incubation in 1% CTAB 
and 0.7 M NaCl at 65 °C for 15 min. After 
extraction with phenol/chloroform, the 
recovered DNA was precipitated with 
ethan ol and then dissolved in ddH2O.   The 
obtained product   was amplified using 
forward primer 27f  5’ -
AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG -3’ and 
reverse primer 1492r   
5’CGGYTACCTTGTTACGACTT -
3’.Sequence data analysis was done using 
Chromas  Pro and Sequencing Analysis 
softwa re.The sequence was input to NCBI to 
identify it by BLAST search.  
 
Phylogenetic Tree Construction     
 
All the sequences were compared with 16S 
rRNA gene sequences available in the 
GenBank databases by BLASTn search and  
the multiple sequence alignments of  partial 
16S rRNA gene sequences from 1 to 712 bp 
were aligned using CLUSTALW, version 
1.8  (Tompson et al., 1994). Phylogenetic trees were constructed from evolutionary 
distances using.  The Neighbor -Joining 
method implemented through NEIGHBOR 
(DNADIST) from  the PHYLIP version 
3.61packages (Felsenstein JP 1993). The 
robustness of the phylogeny  was tested by 
bootstrap analysis using 100 iterations. 
Trees generated were analysed with the 
TREEVIEW program (Page RDM 1996). 
Accession numbers of all isolate can be 
viewed in a respective phylogenetic tree.  
 
Inoculum Preparation    
 
A loop full cell growth from the preserved 
slant was inoculated in 100 ml nutrient broth 
and incubated on an orbital shaker agitating 
at 150 rpm and 32 ± 2 °C temperature for 24 
h. For RB 160 dye decolourization study, 
10% (v/v) of the actively growing culture 
having 3×108 cells/ml was used as inoculum 
in all the further experiments.  
 
Optimization of Physico -Chemical 
Parameters      
 
Temperature, pH and agitation were 
optimized during the experimentation for 
maximizing decolorizing efficiency of the 
isolate. Effect of different incubation 
temperature and pH for dye RB160, were 
carried out in 250ml Erlenmeyer flasks, 
containing 80 ml nutrient broth, 10ml dye 
2.5mg RB160 and the bacterial cul ture 10ml 
having 3 ×108cells/ml contained Optical 
Density 1 at 604 nm .Flasks were incubated 
at 25, 35 and 45 °C temperature.  Effect of 
pH was studied at 3, 5, 7 and 9 and the 
influence of the initial decolourization 
experiment was also carried out under 
aerobic and microaerobic conditions.  Each 
experiment was carried out in triplicate.  
 
Mutagenesis Induction    
 
The cells were harvested from the culture 
medium by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 10 Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2016) 5(3): 534-547 
537 
 min. The cell pellet was washed with 
distilled water and r esuspended in sterile 
deionised water. The colony counting 
method was used for bacterial count and the 
count was adjusted to 2.34× 107 CFU/ml. 
For UV mutagenesis, 15 ml of cell 
suspension was taken and placed under a 
germicidal lamp in a sterile petri –plate, 
distance of 30 cm and exposed to UV light 
upto a 5µ Joule-mm2 dose (260 nm) for the 
induction of a mutant. The time of exposure 
was varied from 30 sec. to 120 sec. For 
chemical mutation, the distilled water 
washed cell pellet was redissolved in 20 ml 
of 0.5, 10, 30 μg/ml concentration of 
acridine orange and were shaken well for 30 
min in an orbital shaker. Samples were taken 
at every 300 sec. and studied. The viability 
of cell count was carried out by the spread 
plate technique and % survival was 
calcul ated using Equation:  
 
S= (N i-Nd/ N i) × 100  
 
Where S is the % survival, N i is the initial 
viable cell count and N d is the viable cell 
count after mutation.  
 
Preparation of Cell Free Extract     
 
The cells of Microbacterium sp. B12 were 
grown for 24 h under microaerobic 
condition at 32 ± 2 °C in 100 ml sterile 
nutrient broth, centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 
min. The culture supernatant was used as an 
extracellular enzymes. Potassium phosphate 
buffer 50 mM, pH 7.4 was used to 
suspended the cells and sonicated 
(Labsonic®M, Sartrious, Germany) at an 
output of 60 A with seven strokes each of 30 
sec. with a 120 sec. interval at 4 °C. The 
obtained extracts were used as a source of 
the intracellular enzyme after centrifugation 
at 10,000 g for 10 min at 4 °C. All the 
enzyme assays were run in triplicates and 
average rates were calculated.  Enzyme Activity  
 
Azo reductase assay and NADH -DCIP (2, 6 
dichloro -phenol indophenol) reductase 
activity were determined using the 
procedure reported earlier by Lade et al.,  
(2012).On e unit of enzyme activity was 
defined as change in absorbance unit per ml 
of enzyme (Mate at al. 2012). Laccase assay 
was carried out by modified procedure of 
Senan and Abraham, (2004). All enzyme 
activities were assayed under ambient 
conditions and perfor med in triplicates.  
 
Biodegradation Analysis  
 
The decolourization assayed was monitored 
by measuring the change in absorbance 
maxima of the dye at λ max 604 nm using the 
UV-vis spectrophotometer.  The colour 
removal was calculated as percent 
decolourizatio n and was expressed as:  
 
Decolourization (%) = [(Initial Absorbance 
– Final Absorbance)/Initial Absorbance] X 
100  
 
The decolourized culture medium was 
centrifuged at 10000 g for 10 min and 
supernatant was collected and extracted with 
ethyl acetate evapora te it and re -dissolved in 
HPLC grade methanol. The mobile phase 
consisted of water: methanol (60:40) with 
flow rate 1 ml/min. The purity was checked 
by UV detector at 254 nm, isocratic system 
and 10 min run time. LC -MS was carried 
out by LCMS -2010SA, Shima dzu, Japan. 
Mass spectra was obtained using an ion – 
trap mass spectrometer fitted with an 
electronic spray (ESI, a Thermo Finnigan 
LCQ -DUO, USA) interface operated in a 
negative ionization mode with a spray 
voltage of 4.5 KV, at a capillary temperature 
of 275⁰C, sheath gas at 40 AU (arbitrary 
unit) and auxiliary gas at 26 AU.

 Phytotoxicity Studies     
 
To assess the toxicity of dye RB160 and its 
metabolite produced after decolourization by 
Microbacterium sp.  phytotoxicity tests were 
carried out on Phaseolus  aureus . The ethyl 
acetate extracted products of dye 250mg/l 
RB160 was dried and dissolved in sterile 
distilled water for phytotoxicity studies. 
Toxicity effect was measured in terms of 
percent inhibition in germination, lengths of 
the plumule and radical of the Phaseolus 
aureus .

 Data were analysed by one way analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) with the tukey -Kramer 
multiple comparisons test.  
 
Results and Discussion  
 
Screening, Isolation and Identification of 
decolourizing bacteria  
 
Soil and wastewater samples contaminated 
with dye RB160 from dye manufacturing 
industry facilitated isolation of twelve 
morphologically distinct isolates showing 
decolourization zone of 2 –10 mm on 
nutrient agar plates containing 250 ppm 
RB160. The isolate 1, which gave the largest 
ratio of decolourisation zone: colony 
diameter of 1.82 for a colony size of 3 –4 
mm was selected for further study. The 
colony of isolated bacteria was yellow -
pigmented, opaque with moist consistency 
and smooth texture. The isolate was gram -
positive, showed positive test for 
carbohydrate fermentation, lead acetate, H 2S 
production, casein and lipid hydrolysis, 
citrate utilization and triple su gar iron and 
negative test for nitrate reduction, indole 
production, gelatin/hydrolysis, starch hydrolysis, decorboxylation, deamination, 
urea hydrolysis and ammonia production  
Based on these results the isolate was 
tentatively identified as Microbacteriu m sp. 
Sequence analysis of 16S rRNA gene 
showed that isolated strain had highest 
similarity of only 97% with the species 
Microbacterium paraoxydans  , which has 
not been reported for decolorizing ability for 
any dyes. Moreover the species is  reported 
in  the blood of leukemia patient (Laffineur 
et al.,  2003). Thus the isolate could be other 
species of Microbacterium. Some species of 
Microbacterium  are also isolated from oil 
polluted soil (Sheng et al.,  2009). Levels of 
less than 97% similarity were found in  the 
type strains of all other recognized 
Microbacterium  species. Based on the 
phenotypic characteristics and phylogenetic 
analysis, strain B12 was designated as a 
species of Microbacterium  ( Figure 1). 
The16S rRNA sequence of Microbacterium  
sp.B12 has bee n deposited in GeneBank 
with the accession number JX984606.  
 
Optimization of Physico -Chemical 
Factors    
 
It is evident from Figure 2a that when 
temperature raised from 25 to 35°C there 
was an inconsistent trend in the 
decolourization by isolate, but when the 
temperature was raised to 45, it was 
observed that the decolourization was 
suddenly declined this might be due to the 
loss of cell viability or deactivation of the 
enzymes responsible for decolourization at 
higher temperature (Ponraj et al.,  2011). 
Maximum decolourization for the dyes 
RB160 was observed at 35°C ± 2°C. Least 
decolourization was observed at 45°C was 
24% after 96 h of incubation. Temperature is 
very important parameter for wastewater 
treatment. Selected isolate was mesophilic 
bacteria beca use it showed best 
decolourization at the temperature 35°C ± Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2016) 5(3): 534-547 
539 
 2°C. The mesophilic range is traditionally 
used (Varel et al.,  1980) since it is generally 
thought that maintaining high temperature 
would be uneconomical, while degradation 
within the psychrophi lic range is too slow 
(Mahmood et al.,  2011).  
 
The best decolourization for dye RB160 was 
at pH 5 with 94% in 96 h. Moreover, from  
the obtained data it can be inferred that 
Microbacterium. sp. exhibited more than 
90% decolourization for dye RB160 over a 
broad range of pH 3 to 9. Decrease in the 
decolourization for dye RB160 was more 
towards alkaline  pH compare to acidic pH 
under study. So the study indicates that the 
acidic pH is less detrimental compare to 
alkaline pH. Figure 2 b. The microaerobic 
conditio n as compared to aerobic conditions, 
which is an oxygen limiting condition, was 
found to better for decolourization of RB160 
Figure 2 c.  
 
Mutagenesis     
 
The dose –response analysis for the UV 
mutagenesis and acridine orange of 
Microbacterium  sp. was done and the % 
survival values are shown in Table 1. The 
dose of UV was assessed by time, 30 sec of 
UV radiation treated strain decolourized 
95% of RB160 in 72 h  and 0.5µg/ml of 
acridine orange showed 94% 
decolourization in 72 h indicated that the 
enhancement in decolorization of RB160 
was due to the bacteria strain after mutated .  
The physical mutagens are time dependent 
and chemical mutagens dose dependent 
(Mouurti et al.,  2010). Hence, here, the UV 
radiation and acridine orange reduced the 
time for dye decol ourization by 24 h the 
survival capacity of the organism was 
decreased drastically with an increase in 
dosage and this is due to lethal DNA 
damage by UV irradiation. The frame shift 
mutation in DNA, due to acridine orange was responsible for the DNA damage . Since 
the self DNA repair mechanism fails in 
certain cases, the mutation caused by the 
acridine orange was permanent. (Gopinath et 
al., 2009).  
 
Enzyme Analysis    
 
In the present study, significant induction of 
laccase, azoreductase and NADH -DCIP 
reductas e activities suggested their 
involvement in the dye degradation shown 
in Table 2 . In the same contest, the inductive 
pattern of reductase was reported during the 
degradation of triazo acid black 210 by 
Providencia sp. SRS82. (Agrawal et al.,  
2014).  
 
Biodeg radation Analysis   
 
Conformation of biodegraded product of RB 
160 by LC -MS. During the degradation 
there was asymmetric cleavage of azo bond 
in RB160 resulting in the formation of  six 
known metabolites 2 -[(4-chloro -1,3,5 -

find different intermediates produced in 
diazo dye degradation by Soybean

 Phytotoxicity Studies     
 
Use of bioassays such as phytotoxicity for 
monitoring the toxic effect of dyes as well as 
its metabolites in plants was suggested by 
many researchers (Lade et al.,  2012). Seed 
germination and plant growth bioassays are 
the most comm on techniques used to 
evaluate the phytotoxicity. In this case, the 
phtotoxicity study revealed that there was an 
inhibition of 25% germination in a solution 
containing 1000 mg/l of RB160 shown in 
Table 3. This study suggests that the dye 
RB160 was toxic t o plants, while the 
metabolites formed after degradation were 
less toxic, which signifies the detoxification 
of dyes by Microbacterium. sp . B12, these 
results underlines the importance of 
Microbacterium  for bioremediation of diazo 
dyes RB160 in terms of bo th decolourization 
and detoxification.  
 
The ability of  Microbacterium sp. B12 to 
decolourize the diazo reactive dye RB160 
under a broad range of temperature, pH, 
agitation, suggested that the isolated strain 
could be useful in biological treatment of 
industrial wastewater. UV -visible 
spectroscopy analysis confirmed 
decolourization, HPLC and LC -MS analysis 
confirmed degradation of RB160.  
 
In conclusion, we found that the 
decolourization and degradation of RB160 
have not been reported by single microbial 
isolate. The present work showed 
decolourization and degradation of RB160 
by Microbacterium sp. B12 within 96 h, at 
pH 5.0 and 35 °C under microaerobic 
conditions. The process could be further 
effectively  developed by using physical and 
chemical mutagens  for improved 
decolourization in less time 72h.  HPLC and 
LC-MS analysis showed formation of new 
metabolites. Phytotoxicity study proves that, 
strains have potential to degrade dye  in to non- toxic compounds. To our knowledge, 
this is first time reported the dec olourization 
and degradation of reactive dye RB160 by 
Microbacterium sp. B12 .
