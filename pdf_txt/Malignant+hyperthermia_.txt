Review Article
Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is an uncommon, life ­threatening pharmacogenetic disorder of the skeletal muscle. 
It presents as a hypermetabolic response in susceptible individuals to potent volatile anesthetics with/without 
depolarizing muscle relaxants; in rare cases, to stress from exertion or heat stress. Susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia (MHS) is inherited as an autosomally dominant trait with variable expression and incomplete penetrance. It is known that the pathophysiology of MH is related to an uncontrolled rise of myoplasmic calcium, which activates biochemical processes resulting in hypermetabolism of the skeletal muscle. In most cases, defects in the ryanodine receptor are responsible for the functional changes of calcium regulation in MH, and more than 300 mutations have been identified in the RYR1 gene, located on chromosome 19q13.1. The classic signs of MH include 
increase of end ­tidal carbon dioxide, tachycardia, skeletal muscle rigidity, tachycardia, hyperthermia and acidosis. 
Up to now, muscle contracture test is regarded as the gold standard for the diagnosis of MHS though molecular genetic test is used, on a limited basis so far to diagnose MHS. The mortality of MH is dramatically decreased from 70-80% to less than 5%, due to an introduction of dantrolene sodium for treatment of MH, early detection of MH 
episode using capnography, and the introduction of diagnostic testing for MHS. This review summarizes the clinically essential and important knowledge of MH, and presents new developments in the field. (Korean J Anesthesiol 2012; 63: 391­401)

Introduction
Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is an inherited, pharmaco­
genetic skeletal muscle disorder involving the dysregulated 
myoplasmic Ca2+, hypercontracture, and hypermetabolism in 
response to an exposure to potent volatile anesthetics with/without depolarizing muscle relaxants, and can be triggered by exertional or heat stress without pharmacologic triggering agents in rare cases [1,2]. Susceptibility to malignant hyper­
thermia (MHS) is inherited as an autosomally dominant trait 
with variable expression and incomplete penetrance [1]. As 
almost all individuals with MHS appear normal without any 
pathologic signs, it is impossible to diagnose susceptibility 
without either the exposure to triggering agents or by specific 392 www.ekja.org
Vol. 63, No. 5, November 2012 Malignant hyperthermia
diagnostic testing. 
Although the estimated genetic prevalence of MHS is 
reported as up to 1 : 2,000 -3,000 in individuals [3 ­5], MH 
episodes are very rare and modern anesthetic techniques, such 
as increasing use of non ­triggering intravenous anesthetics 
and avoidance of succinylcholine are more likely to make it even rarer, leading to the potential risk of reduced awareness of 
anesthesiologists for MH. 
When MH was first recognized as a complication of anesthesia, 
the mortality rate was 70 -80% [6]. Nowadays, the mortality 
rate is estimated to be less than 5%, with early detection of MH episode, using capnography, prompt use of the drug dantrolene, and the introduction of diagnostic testing [7]. Even though the 
mortality rates of MH are low, according to a recent study by 
Larach et al. [8], the morbidity rate of MH is 34.8%. This high 
morbidity rate emphasizes the need for continuing education 
of anesthesiologists on the most effective way to diagnose and 
treat MH. 
The purpose of this review is to summarize the clinically 
essential and important knowledge of MH and presents new 
developments in the field. 
Epidemiology
Although the exact incidence of malignant hyperthermia is 
unknown, the incidence during general anesthesia is estimated 
to range from 1 : 5,000 to 1 : 50,000 -100,000 in individuals [7,9]. 
However, the true number of individuals with MHS is likely to be much greater, as individuals with MHS may undergo 
anesthesia uneventfully several times before a clinical episode 
occurs and many cases of MH may go undetected because 
many individuals with MHS are never anesthetized, have short 
durations of exposure, or have mild, uncomplicated presen­
tations that are never diagnosed. Generally, the estimated prevalence of MHS is thought to be approximately 1 in 50,000 
or less. However, according to the results of recent molecular 
genetic studies, the estimated genetic prevalence may be up to 
1 : 2,000 -3,000 because MHS is inherited as an autosomally 
dominant trait [3 ­5]. 
MH has been reported in every country, and all races are 
susceptible [7]. MH occurs more frequently in males than 
females [7,8], and more commonly in children and young adults 
with the mean age of 18.3 years [10]. Although reported in the 
newborn, the earliest reaction confirmed by testing is six months 
of age [10]. Although the exact cause for male predominance 
of MH is unclear, suggested hypothesis includes differences 
in ionic channels for muscle contraction influenced by either 
sex hormones or native differences among genders, higher incidences false ­positive diagnosis among males, as well as a 
difference in genetic inheritance [11 ­13]. In a prevalence and clinical outcome study from New York State from 2001 to 2005, the estimated prevalence of MH for males was 2.5 -4.5 times 
the rate for females, and the median age at presentation was 22 years with 45% of MH cases occurring in those who were 19 
years or younger [14]. 
The mortality rates of MH dramatically decreased from 70 -
80% to 10% after an introduction of dantrolene sodium for the 
treatment of MH, and recent mortality is estimated to be less 
than 5% with early detection of MH episode using capnography, 
prompt use of the drug dantrolene, and the introduction of diagnostic testing [6,7]. Although the mortality rates of MH are 
low, the morbidity rate of MH is much higher. According to 
the recent study of Larach et al.[8], the morbidity rate of MH 
is 34.8% and frequently reported complications are changes 
in the consciousness level/coma (9.8%), cardiac dysfunction 
(9.4%), pulmonary edema (8.4%), renal dysfunction (97.3%), 
disseminated intravascular coagulation (7.2%), and hepatic 
dysfunction (5.6%). This high morbidity rate emphasizes the 
need for continuing education of anesthesiologists on the most effective way to diagnose and treat MH. 
Pathophysiology
Malignant hyperthermia, a dominantly inherited pharmaco­
genetic skeletal muscle disorder characterized by skeletal 
muscle hypermetabolism, occurs in susceptible individuals 
following exposure to potent halogenated anesthetics or 
depolarizing muscle relaxants during anesthesia [7]. Although 
the exact mechanism by which triggering agents initiate MH 
has not been fully elucidated yet, numerous experimental 
evidences from various sources clearly indicate that underlying 
causes of this hypermetabolism are related to an uncontrolled 
release of calcium from skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) [1,2,15 ­18].
During excitation ­contraction coupling, muscle membrane 
depolarization induces a conformational change in the 
dihydropyridine ­sensitive L ­type voltage ­dependent calcium 
channel (DHPR). This conformational change leads to activa­
tion of the ryanodine receptor type 1 (RYR1) and the rapid 
release of Ca
2+ from its stores in the SR. Released Ca2+ binds 
to troponin C, causing movement of tropomyosin away from the myosin ­binding sites on the thin filament and triggering 
muscle contraction. Muscle contraction is terminated when Ca
2+ is actively pumped back into the SR by the ATP ­dependent 
calcium pump. This process is the fundamental excitation ­
contraction coupling (ECC) needed for normal skeletal muscle 
function [19,20]. 
In the early phase of MH, the muscle cells attempt to restore 
homeostasis by sequestering calcium through increasing in 
aerobic and anaerobic metabolism [7]. However, in malignant 393 www.ekja.org
Korean J Anesthesiol Dong-Chan Kim
hyperthermia susceptible muscle, the uncontrolled release 
of calcium and the rise in myoplasmic calcium caused by the 
triggering agents overpowers the cellular capacity to reestablish homeostasis. This pathologically enhanced myoplasmic calcium 
rise eventually reaches the threshold levels for myofibrillar 
contraction, and results in sustained muscle contraction. The 
sustained muscle contraction produces a rapid depletion of 
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) with a concomitant increase 
in glucose metabolism, oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide 
production, and heat production. ATP stores become depleted, 
which progressively lead to the failure of membrane integrity 
with leakage of muscle cell contents (including electrolytes, myoglobin and various other sarcoplasmic proteins, like CK 
into the circulation [7]. 
The cause of dysfunctional calcium regulation in skeletal 
muscle with MHS lies, in most cases, in a defective RYR1 in SR, 
which is the footplate protein seated between the DHPR and SR 
[21­23]. Major defects in these two receptors (RYR1 and DHPR), 
as well as in other proteins, such as, triadin and FK 506 binding protein involved in the myoplasmic calcium regulation, are 
responsible for the functional changes of calcium regulation in MH. It is widely accepted that the gene of RYR1 (RYR1) is the 
major, though not exclusive, site for mutations associated with 
MHS [24,25]. Approximately 70% of families with MHS carry 
mutations in RYR1  [26­28].
Although mutations in RYR1  gene are undoubtedly impor­
tant in the pathophysiology of MH, it is clear that not all families 
exhibit linkage to this gene. Other potential genetic loci have 
been identified, such as mutations in CACNA1S  encodes the α1­
subunit of DHPR [29,30].
Clinical Presentation and Diagnosis 
The diagnosis of MH is based on clinical presentations or 
laboratory testing. However, the clinical presentations and first signs of MH episode are highly variable, especially when 
some individuals exhibit only one or a few symptoms of 
varying intensity; it is not easy to diagnose MH with confidence 
[31,32]. Although the underlying causes for the variability of the clinical presentation are poorly understood, different potency, 
concentration and duration of exposure to the triggering 
inhalation anesthetics, as well as additional factors, such as 
temperature, age and genetic variability, may be related with the 
heterogeneous clinical presentations [31,33,34]. The variability 
in the order and time of onset of signs often makes the clinical 
diagnosis rather difficult [7,35,36]. 
The characteristic clinical signs of MH, during general 
anesthesia, are tachycardia, unexplained elevation of end ­tidal 
carbon dioxide (ET
CO2) concentration, muscle rigidity, acidosis, 
hyperthermia, and evidence of rhabdomyolysis. The most frequent and the earliest sign of MH is unexplained sinus tachy­cardia, together with unexplained elevation of end ­tidal carbon 
dioxide. In a clinical analysis study of MH cases reported to the 
North American Malignant Hyperthermia Registry from 1987 to 
2006 [8], frequent first signs of MH include hypercapnia (92%), 
sinus tachycardia (73%), and masseter muscle rigidity (27%). In 
63.5% of cases, temperature abnormality (median maximum, 
39.1
oC) was the first to third sign. Whereas 78.6% presented 
both muscular abnormalities and respiratory acidosis, only 26.0% had metabolic acidosis.
The unexplained elevation of end ­tidal carbon dioxide may 
be the earliest and the most common sign of MH episode in the 
intubated and mechanically ventilated patient [37]. Especially, 
when succinylcholine is used as the relaxing agent, abrupt rise 
of end ­tidal carbon dioxide can be observed [38]. However, with 
a decline in the use of succinylcholine, a more gradual rise in CO
2, rather than an abrupt rise are often noted, and it is possible 
to mask this rise by increasing the minute ventilation [39]. 
Sinus tachycardia is observed in almost all patients as one of 
the early signs of MH episode, and may be misinterpreted as an 
inadequate anesthetic depth. 
Although the severe, rapidly developing hyperthermia is 
considered as a hallmark of MH from when malignant hyper­
thermia is described firstly in 1960 to nowadays, increasing 
body temperature is a relatively late sign of MH and is even 
absent sometimes [40,41]. Therefore, one should not wait for this sign to appear before making the diagnosis. When 
hyperthermia occurs, the rate of temperature increase may be 
as rapid as 1 -2
oC every five minutes, up to greater than 44oC, 
and leads to a marked increase in oxygen consumption, carbon 
dioxide production, widespread vital organ dysfunction, and 
disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)[42]. The rate of 
temperature elevation is much more of a differential diagnostic 
and prognostic value than peak temperature, though higher 
maximum temperatures significantly increase the likelihood 
of MH complications [2,8]. For patient safety, a monitoring of core temperature is essentially recommended in all anesthetics 
expected to last ≥ 30 minutes [8,43].
Generalized muscular rigidity is a definitive sign of MH and 
reflects the Ca
2+­dependent activation of muscle contraction 
accompanying activation of both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism. About 50 -80% of the patients present generalized 
muscular rigidity [2]. If MH is suspected, peripheral muscular rigidity should be checked [41]. 
The change in arterial pressure is not usually marked in 
the early phase of MH. As MH episode progresses, late clinical 
signs, such as cyanosis, cardiac arrhythmias, mixed respiratory 
and metabolic acidosis, and various electrolyte imbalances 
arise. 
Rhabdomyolysis is another clinical sign related to the dest­394 www.ekja.org
Vol. 63, No. 5, November 2012 Malignant hyperthermia
ruction of skeletal muscle and is manifested by brown or cola ­
colored urine. Acute renal failure may occur due to myoglobin 
precipitation in the renal tubules and close observation and 
laboratory monitoring for myoglobin should be instituted [44].
Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a poor pro­
gnostic sign in MH. Larach et al. [45] found that DIC was associated with a 50 ­fold increased likelihood of cardiac arrest and an 89 ­fold 
likelihood of death.
Numerous conditions may resemble MH during anesthesia 
that present unspecific signs, such as tachycardia, hypercapnia, and hyperthermia, which may be confused with MH. These 
include surgical stress, inadequate anesthetic depth, sepsis, 
thyroid storm, pheochromocytoma, iatrogenic overheating, 
malfunction of anesthetic equipment, and etc. [7,41]. 
Larach et al. [46] had developed a clinical grading scale in 
order to assist in a clinical diagnosis of MH in 1994. The clinical 
grading scale is a scoring system that gives differential score to the various clinical manifestations of MH episode, such 
as muscle rigidity, muscle breakdown, respiratory acidosis, 
metabolic acidosis, temperature increase, cardiac involvement 
and family history. The scores are summed and categorized into 
six different groups to assess the likelihood of an intraoperative event representing an MH episode. The elements of the scoring 
system and interpretation are given in Table 1 and 2. This 
scoring system allows us some guidance in deciding whether 
a patient may be suffering from MH or not, without the use of 
specialized diagnostic testing. However, if data are partly or totally unavailable, which is common, the clinical grading scale lacks sensitivity to diagnose MH since evaluation using this 
scale depends on the availability of data [47,48].
Laboratory Diagnostic Tests for MHS
As almost all individuals with MHS are asymptomatic during 
daily life, specific testing is needed to confirm or exclude MHS. In probands who have survived from a suspected MH episode, 
the confirmation of MHS diagnosis is very important because 
other family members may be affected by this dominantly 
inherited disorder. Also, the exclusion of MHS diagnosis 
in relatives of proband is equally important because MH is 
almost fatal if not rapidly diagnosed and treated. It would be a 
significant improvement for anesthesia risk management if we 
could reliably predict or confirm MHS [31,49].
The standard test for MHS diagnosis is the muscle con­
tracture test, and recently, molecular genetic test is introduced.
The muscle contracture test
The most widely used and the most sensitive method for 
determining whether an individual is susceptible to MH is the 
muscle contracture test [32]. The muscle contracture test for 
diagnosis of MHS that involves exposing living muscle fiber 
bundles to halothane, and separately to caffeine according to 
a strict protocol, was developed based on the observations of Kalow et al. [50] and Ellis et al. [51] in 1970s.
After the processes of standardization (e.g., which muscle 
to biopsy, exposure regimens and diagnostic thresholds) to 
develop an accurate diagnostic test for MHS, this has been 
the "gold standard" for diagnosis of MHS. These processes of 
standardization led to the formation of two slightly different 
protocols, a European version (IVCT; the in vitro contracture 
test) by the European Malignant Hyperthermia Group 
(EMHG) and a North American version (CHCT; the caffeine ­
halothane contracture test) by the North American Malignant Table 1. Criteria Used in the Clinical Grading Scale for Malignant Hyperthermia (Adapted from Larach et al. [46] and Rosenberg et al. [7])

Hyperthermia Group (NAMHG) [52,53].
While similarities exist in performing and interpreting the 
results of tests, such as the criteria for muscle sampling, muscle 
biopsy extraction to testing time, and muscle viability assess­
ments, there are significant differences between the two protocols 
[52,53]. When muscle is acquired anatomically, the NAMHG 
protocol may use any muscle site; whereas, the EMHG protocol 
limits muscle specimens from the vastus lateralis. The NAMHG 
protocol uses exposure to a single concentration of halothane (3%) with a range of diagnostic thresholds (0.2 -0.7 g), while the 
EMHG protocol uses incremental exposure to halothane (0.5, 1, 2%) with a uniform diagnostic threshold (≥ 0.2 g). The NAMHG 
protocol considers a positive CHCT result if any one of the three 
bundles exposed to halothane or the three bundles exposed 
to caffeine exhibit a positive response (contracture of ≥ 0.7 g to 
3% halothane or contracture of ≥ 0.3 g to 2.0 mMl/L caffeine), 
then the individual tested is judged to be MH susceptible 
(MHS); otherwise, he or she is considered normal (MHN) [54,55]. In contrast, the EMHG protocol requires a positive 
response (contracture of ≥ 0.2 g to ≤ 2% halothane) in one of 
the two bundles tested with halothane and a positive response 
(contracture of ≥ 0.2 g to ≤ 2.0 mmol/L caffeine) in one of the 
two bundles with caffeine to be diagnosed as MH susceptible 
(MHS) [56]. If the results of the halothane and caffeine tests are 
negative, then the individual is diagnosed as normal (MHN). 
If a positive response occurs only to halothane or to caffeine, 
the test result is labeled as MH equivocal (MHE), although the individual is regarded clinically as MHS. This individual is 
further subdivided into MHE (h) and MHE (c), depending on 
whether the positive response was to halothane or to caffeine, 
respectively [52]. Currently, North American testing centers use 
a lower threshold for MHS, referred to as a clinical diagnosis 
(contracture ≥ 0.5 g to 3% halothane, and a contracture ≥ 0.3 
g to 2 mM caffeine), to include as many susceptible patients 
as possible with the possibility of misdiagnosing a patient as 
MHS when they might be MHN. When individuals are going to be used in genetic studies, a higher threshold (halothane 
contracture ≥ 0.7 g) for diagnosis of MHS is used. As such, only 
patients truly susceptible will be included in research [57].
Like any tests used in clinical medicine, muscle contracture 
testing has limits on its sensitivity and specificity. Because MH episode is potentially fatal, the thresholds for diagnostic testing 
require a high degree of sensitivity and an acceptable degree 
of specificity. This means that anesthesiologists are willing to 
accept false ­positive responses to avoid false ­negative ones 
because the consequences of a false ­negative diagnosis might 
be disastrous. Consequently, the diagnostic thresholds were 
established to minimize the possibility of false ­negative results. 
The EMHG protocol may reduce the possibility of false 
positive and negative results, when compared to that of the NAMHG protocol; however, obtained results were similar, 
overall [58]. Despite the use of low cutoff for interpreting and 
risking higher false positive in the EMHG protocol, the IVCT has a 99% of sensitivity and a 93.6% of specificity, while the NAMHG 
protocol has a sensitivity and a specificity of 97 -98% and 
78-80%, respectively [55,56]. Thus, there are a 1% chance of 
misdiagnosing a MH ­susceptible individual as MHN, and a 6% 
chance of misdiagnosing a individual without susceptibility as MHS in the EMHG protocol; whereas there are a 2 -3% chance 
that test will incorrectly mislabel a MH ­susceptible individual as 
MHN, and a 20% chance that a individual without susceptibility 
will be labeled as MHS in the NAMHG protocol.
Although the decision to proceed with muscle contracture 
test depends on numerous factors, including the features of the suspected MH event, family history, patients’ willingness, 
etc, in general, muscle contracture test should be performed 
on individuals with a clinical history of MH or close relatives of 
known MH susceptible individuals to exclude MHS [32].
Even though muscle contracture test still regarded as the 
gold standard for the diagnosis of MHS, this test is invasive, 
expensive, and can be performed only at specialized centers. Therefore, the search for a less invasive method than IVCT/
CHCT to diagnose MHS has been ongoing for many years, and 
molecular genetic testing based on advances in molecular 
genetics and cellular physiology has been introduced as an 
attractive alternative [32,59]. 
The molecular genetic testing
Although molecular genetic testing for MHS has been 
introduced relatively recently, it is used as a diagnostic test for 
MHS, in limited capacity, in Europe and North America [60 ­62]. 
Molecular genetic testing was first suggested as a method of 
MHS diagnosis in 1990, when a mutation within RYR1  encoding 
the skeletal muscle calcium release channel was identified [63]. Since then, it was identified that about 70% of MHS have been 
linked to RYR1  with over 300 mutations associated with MHS 
[28,61,64]. With the identification of causative mutations in RYR1 , 
and the rapid developments in molecular genetics technology, molecular genetic testing is expected to be a screening test for 
MHS diagnosis. However, it is not realized at this time because of 
the metabolic complexity, discordance between phenotype and 
genotype, and genetic heterogeneity of MHS [65 ­68].
At present, despite more than 300 MHS associated mutations 
in RYR1  have been identified, only 30 functionally confirmed 
causative point mutations have been approved as diagnostic 
mutations for MHS by EMHG, and 29 have been formally 
accepted as causative mutations by the MAMHG [61]. This 
means that these only 30 causative mutations can be used for 
screening of MHS diagnosis. The most important limitation of 396 www.ekja.org
Vol. 63, No. 5, November 2012 Malignant hyperthermia
screening of MHS, using molecular genetic test at this time, is 
that the absence of causative RYR1  mutations itself cannot rule 
out MHS without muscle contracture test. Therefore, molecular genetic test for MHS diagnosis should always be used in 
selected and genetically characterized families, as well as under 
the guidelines for molecular genetic test recommended by the 
EMHG [60,62].
When MHS is confirmed in a proband or appropriate family 
member by muscle contracture test and a causative mutation is identified, then molecular genetic test becomes valuable 
for other members of the family, as other members of the 
family can be diagnosed as MHS by relatively a simple test for 
the presence of the same familial mutation, without muscle 
contracture test. Mutation ­positive members would be regarded 
as MHS without muscle contracture test. However, individuals in whom the familial mutation was not identified must undergo 
muscle contracture test, in order to confirm or exclude MHS [60,62]. 
Molecular genetic test for MHS diagnosis has some limita­
tions, including the relatively low sensitivity (25%) and the considerable amount of interindividual and intraindividual 
variability in phenotypic expression in individuals with MHS 
[32,69]. Ongoing investigations will unveil further causative 
mutations, and thereby improve the usefulness and efficacy of 
molecular genetic testing in the future. 
Management of MH Episode
Early recognition of the early signs of MH episode and imme­
diate starting of appropriate treatment is essential for successful treatment of MH as the prognosis is poorer if late signs appear. 
Although the early signs of MH episode are nonspecific, 
anesthesiologists should be familiar with the nature of the 
condition and clinical signs of MH episode, and maintain awa­reness during general anesthesia in order to diagnose rapidly. 
Table 3 lists the clinical signs associated with MH. Because the 
clinical presentation of MH episode highly varies, treatment 
should be modified accordingly [70].
Once MH episode is suspected, all triggering agents should 
be discontinued immediately and the vaporizer for the volatile 
anesthetic should be removed from the anesthesia machine. 
If the surgical procedure must continue after discontinuation 
of triggering agents, anesthesia should be maintained using non­triggering agents, including opioids, sedatives, and non ­
depolarizing muscle relaxants.
It is imperative to call additional experienced help imme­
dia tely because the coordinated team approach will lead to 
the most efficient implementation of the recommended inter­
ventions. 
The patient should be hyperventilated with 100% oxygen 
(>10 L/min) through a non ­rebreathing circuit at 2 -3 times the 
normal minute ventilation to correct hypoxemia and respiratory 
acidosis.
The only specific drug to manage MH is dantrolene sodium, 
a specific ryanodine receptor antagonist that inhibits the 
pathologically increased calcium release from the sarcoplasmic 
reticulum in the affected individuals [71,72]. The recommended 
initial dosage is 2.5 mg/kg administered intravenously every 5 
minutes, up to the total of 10 mg/kg until the hypermetabolism is 
Table 3. Clinical Signs Associated with MH (Adapted from Glagn et al. [70])

overcome and clinical signs subside. In some cases, the dose may 
be as much as 20 mg/kg. If more than 20 mg/kg of dantrolene is 
not successful, the diagnosis of MH should be recon  sidered. After 
the acute crisis has been controlled, dantrolene 1 mg/kg every 4 
to 6 hours or alternatively 0.25 mg/kg/hr continuous infusion 
for 24 hours is recommended. The prognosis is markedly influ  ­
enced by the time between the onset of symptoms and the 
administration of dantrolene at a starting dose of 2.5 mg/kg [2,70]. 
Although dantrolene sodium has no direct effect on actin/myosin binding, and no effect on the neuromuscular junction [73], 
dantrolene sodium may cause significant muscle weakness in 
patients with pre ­existing neuromuscular disease [7]. Therefore, 
it should be used with extreme caution in those patients. Adverse effects, associated with dantrolene sodium, include muscle 
weakness, a sense of respiratory inadequacy, fatigue, dizziness, 
blurred vision, nausea, and thrombophlebitis [71]. 
Hyperthermia, a late clinical sign, should be treated with a 
variety of cooling techniques, including the use of cold 0.9% sodium chloride intravenous fluids, lavage of the stomach, 
bladder, rectal, or open cavity, and placement of ice packs on 
the neck, axilla, and groin. During the application of the cooling 
maneuver, core temperature should be monitored at the appro­
priate monitoring sites, including distal esophagus, naso  pharynx, 
tympanic membrane, rectum, bladder, or axilla, as the patient 
should be cooled to no less than 38
oC to avoid any additional 
problems. 
Hyperkalemia may be life ­threatening and precipitate 
cardiac arrhythmias; therefore, hyperkalemia should be agg­
ressi  vely treated with insulin, dextrose, sodium bicarbonate, 
and calcium.
The mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis should be 
treated with hyperventilation at 2 to 3 times the predicted 
minute ventilation with 100% oxygen, and intravenous admini­
stration of 1 -4 mEq/kg sodium bicarbonate. Repeated admini­
stration of sodium bicarbonate might be necessary because of 
a continuous efflux of lactate from cells as lactate only crosses 
through cell membranes slowly.
Initial management of cardiac arrhythmias includes treat­
ment of the underlying acidosis and hyperkalemia as most arrhythmias during MH episode usually occur due to hyper­
kalemia and acidosis. If arrhythmias do not respond to the 
initial management, antiarrhythmic therapy using lidocaine, 
amiodarone and β­adrenoceptor blocking agents should 
be initiated. For the control of cardiac arrhythmias, calcium channel blocker (e.g., verapamil, diltiazem) should not be used 
as these drugs interact with dantrolene, and can lead to life ­
threatening hyperkalemia, myocardial depression and ulti  ma tely 
cardiac arrest [7,72].
As myoglobinemia and myoglobinuria, due to acute rhabdo­
myolysis, increase the risk of kidney damage, urine output should be maintained at greater than 2 ml/kg/hr with more 
aggressive hydration, urine alkalinization, and diuretics [74]. 
In addition to the monitoring devices already in place (tem­
perature probe, electrocardiogram, and arterial oxygen satu­
ration), additional monitoring devices, such as an arterial can­
nula, a central venous catheter, as well as a urinary catheter in 
order to monitor renal function, should be used. 
Laboratory testing should be performed immediately at 
the onset of an episode and periodically thereafter. Laboratory 
monitoring parameters include arterial and venous blood gases, electrolytes, coagulation profile, myoglobin and creatine kinase 
(CK). Arterial blood gases, serum electrolytes, and blood sugar 
should be checked every 15 minutes until the clinical signs 
of MH subside. The concentration of CK should be measured 
every 6 ­8 hours, until the value is normalized as CK is a guide to 
the status of muscle destruction, and will peak at 14 -20 hours 
after muscle damage occurs [41]. 
After stabilization, the patient should be closely observed in 
ICU for at least 36 -48 hours because MH recurs in about 25% of 
patients within 48 hours of a treated episode [7,75]. Dantrolene 
sodium at a dose of 1 mg/kg should be continued every 4 to 
6 hours intravenously during this period, depending on the 
clinical and laboratory parameters.
MHS and Association with Idiopathic 
HyperCKemia and Other Neuromuscular 
Disorders 
Idiopathic hyperCKemia
Idiopathic hyperCKemia (IH) is a persistently elevated serum 
concentration of creatine kinase (CK) i.e., at least 3 serum CK 
levels more than twice normal over at least 3 months, without 
weakness or other significant neuromuscular symptoms [76,77]. 
Persistently elevated serum concentration of creatine kinase 
(CK) usually accompanies muscle weakness in patients with myopathies. However, it may also be found in individuals with a 
normal neurological examination, possibly due to subclinical or 
preclinical neuromuscular disorders, dystrophinopathy carrier 
state, hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, alcoholism, or 
intake of statins and other drugs, and this condition is labeled 
asymptomatic hyperCKemia [78 ­80]. When the cause is not 
found, even after extensive investigations, the condition is defined as IH. Capasso et al. [80] studied a series of individuals 
with IH and found IH is familial in 46% of cases and familial IH is a benign genetically heterogeneous condition that is 
autosomal ­dominant in at least 60% of cases, with higher pen­
etrance in men.
Individuals with IH have long been suspected to have MHS 
and various studies have concluded IH to be a weak predictor 398 www.ekja.org
Vol. 63, No. 5, November 2012 Malignant hyperthermia
of MHS [81 ­83]. Weglinski et al. [84] studied 49 asymptomatic 
individuals with IH and reported 24/40 (49%), while in a more 
recent investigation of 37 Italian subjects with IH, muscle 
contracture test detected one out of 37 individuals to be 
MHS (2.7%) [85]. This discrepancy, between the results of the 
investigation, may be caused by different inclusion criteria of 
the investigation [35].
Although increased serum levels of CK are a valid reason to 
screen for underlying neuromuscular disorders, and to suspect MHS [86], no certain correlation has been reported between 
serum levels of CK and MHS [79,85,86]. Meanwhile, if serum 
level of CK is increased in an individual who has a first ­degree 
relative proven MHS, then the individual can be considered to be susceptible [87]. Therefore, individuals with IH, who 
belonged to a family with a history of MH, could be susceptible 
to MH but IH itself can be used as a predictor for MHS.
Neuromuscular disorders associated with MHS
Although individuals with certain neuromuscular disorders 
have long been suspected to have MHS, the risk of MH or MH ­
like reactions in patients with known neuromuscular dis  orders 
is not easy to determine. Because a number of case reports and 
small series have discussed patients with these dis  orders, who 
developed one or more of the following clinical symptoms: 
rigidity, increased temperature, arrhythmia, rhabdo    my olysis, 
and hyperkalemia, during or after anesthesia, the anesthe­
siologist is confronted with the question of whether there is a 
true association between these disorders and MHS. However, it is important to recognize an association between these 
disorders and MHS, as the different underlying pathophy  sio­
logical mechanism is to require different treatment and have 
different implications for future anesthetic management of the 
patient and their family. 
The neuromuscular disorders that have a strong evidence for 
close association with MHS include central core disease (CCD), multi ­minicore disease (MmCD) with RYR1  mutation and King 
Denborough syndrome [88 ­90]. 
Central Core Disease (CCD) is a rare hereditary myopathy 
with autosomal dominant inheritance, which is characterized clinically by muscle weakness of variable degree and histo­
logical by a predominance of type I fibers, containing clearly 
defined areas (central cores) lacking oxidative enzyme activity [91]. Individuals with CCD have been suspected to have MHS 
early, because individuals with MHS may have central cores on 
muscle biopsy [89], and individuals with CCD may be prone 
to MH episodes [92,93]. In the majority of cases, mutations 
associated with CCD are found mainly in RYR1  gene [26,94]. 
Among the reported mutations in RYR1  associated with MHS 
or CCD, more than 150 mutations are associated with MHS, approximately 100 mutations predispose to CCD, and more than 20 mutations appear to be associated with both MHS 
and CCD[1,64]. Therefore, Individuals with CCD should be 
considered as MHS and should be avoided triggering agents. 
Multi ­minicore disease (MmCD) is a recessively inherited 
congenital myopathy, characterized clinically by neonatal hypo­tonia, delayed motor development, and axial muscle weakness, 
which leads to the development of scoliosis and significant 
respiratory involvement, and histological by multifocal, well ­
circumscribed areas (multi cores) with reduction of oxidative staining and low myofibrillar ATPase [95]. It is generally 
accepted that MmCD is associated with mutations in two genes, 
SEPN1  and RYR1  [96,97]. Even though the association with 
MHS is not well documented, clinical MH episodes have been 
recognized in few cases with MmCD [98,99]. 
King Denborough syndrome is a rare congenital myopathy 
associated with MHS, characterized by skeletal abnormalities, 
such as palmar simian line, pectus excavatum, winging of the 
scapulae, lumbar lordosis and mild thoracic scoliosis and 
dysmorphic features with characteristic facial appearance, such 
as dysmorphic facies, ptosis, down ­slanting palpebral fissures, 
hypertelorism, epicanthic folds, low ­set ears, malar hypoplasia, 
and micrognathia [7,100]. Inheritance of King ­Denborough 
syndrome is unclear. Approximately one half of individuals with 
King­Denborough syndrome demonstrate the baseline elevated 
serum CK levels [101]. Recently, RYR1  mutation associated with 
King ­Denborough syndrome are identified and reported [102]. 
Individuals with King ­Denborough syndrome also should be 
considered as MHS and should not receive triggering agents. 
Current Status of Malignant Hyperthermia 
in Korea 
In recent years, RYR1  mutations related MHS have been 
iden  tified and reported in Korea [99,103,104]. However, the 
current state of MH in Korea is far from optimistic, in terms of 
underestimation of the incidence, poor diagnostic tests for MHS 
and limited availability of dantrolene sodium.
Because there is no national based MH database and case 
reports published on journals have been the exclusive resource for estimating the incidence of MH, the incidence of MH has 
long been underestimated in Korea. Only 27 cases have been 
reported during the year 1971 -2007 [105]. The estimation of 
incidence based on the reported cases is underestimated, since the case reports published on journals only represent a part 
of the real number of MH cases. To estimate incidence with 
confidence, we should try to establish a national based MH 
database.
Although RYR1  mutations related MHS are discovered and 
reported in Korea, patients with MHS are mainly diagnosed on 399 www.ekja.org
Korean J Anesthesiol Dong-Chan Kim
the basis of clinical manifestations without specific laboratory 
tests to confirm MHS; since there is no laboratory facility to 
confirm MHS who experienced MH episode during anesthesia. 
Lastly, dantrolene sodium, the only specific drug for MH 
episode, can be available in Korea since several years ago. 
However, dantrolene sodium is still limitedly available, because 
dantrolene sodium is only supplied by KODC (Korean Orphan 
Drug Center). 
The systemic efforts to improve the situations described 
above are required for the patients’ safety in Korea.
