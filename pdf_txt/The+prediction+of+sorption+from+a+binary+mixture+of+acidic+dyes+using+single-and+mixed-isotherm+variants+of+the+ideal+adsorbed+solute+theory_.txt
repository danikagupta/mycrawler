Abstract. The sorption of Acid Blue 9 onto the mixture of activated clay and activated carbon has been studied
in terms of pseudo-ﬁrst order and pseudo-second order chemical sorption processes. The batch sorption model,based on the assumption of a pseudo-second order mechanism, has been developed to predict the rate constant ofsorption and the equilibrium capacity with the effect of initial dye concentration, mass of mixed sorbent, temperatureand initial solution pH. The rates of sorption were found to conform to pseudo-second order kinetics with goodcorrelation. Batch isotherm studies showed that the sorption of Acid Blue 9 by the mixed sorbent from aqueoussolution was described by the Langmuir isotherm equation. A comparison of the evaluated equilibrium capacity ofsorption has been made by the pseudo-second order rate equation as well as by the Langmuir isotherm and operatingline method. In addition, an activation energy of sorption has also been determined based on the pseudo-secondorder rate constants.

Introduction
In modern industrial society, dyes are used everywhere.
Because they are inert and nontoxic when dischargedinto waste streams, people always overlook their un-desirable nature. Some are harmful to aquatic life inrivers where they are discharged. Decolourizing of tex-tile and dye-manufacturing wastewater is currently amajor problem for environmental managers. Colouredefﬂuent treatment has not received much attention as itwas thought to be of only aesthetic concern. Sorptiontechniques produce high quality treated efﬂuents andsorption processes have been investigated as a methodto remove dyes from wastewater. The most widely usedsorbent for industrial applications is activated carbon(Walker and Weatherley, 1997; Khalil and Girgis, 1998;
∗To whom correspondence should to addressed.Porter et al., 1999). There are still problems associatedwith its use; namely, activated carbon is expensive andthe higher the quality the greater the cost. Extensiveinvestigations are being carried out to identify suitablerelatively cheap sorbents capable of removing signiﬁ-cant quantities of acid dyes. Table 1 shows a numberof cheap sorbents available for acid dye sorption.
In recent years, clay has been accepted as one of the
most appropriate low cost sorbents. For the treatmentof colours, such as carpet efﬂuents containing mainlyMetomega Chrome Orange GL (Gupta and Shukla,1996), the popular chrome dye, Omega Chrome RedME (Gupta et al., 1992) and the acid dye (Khattri andSingh, 1998) as well as the treatment of heavy met-als, such as lead(II) (Yadava et al., 1991) and cesium(Sawhney, 1966), the application of sorption tech-niques using clay has been tested. In addition, the mixedsorbent systems, such as the sorption of lead(II) by140 Ho and Chiang

In this paper, experiments have been carried out
to expect the sorption capacity and kinetics of AcidBlue 9 from aqueous solution using the mixture of ac-tivated clay and activated carbon. The factors studiedinclude the in ﬂuence of initial dye concentration, mass
of mixed sorbent, temperature and initial solution pHon the sorption kinetics of the system. A rate parameter,k, has been de ﬁned and used to describe the sorption
of acid dye onto mixed sorbent. In addition, a com-parison of a pseudo- ﬁrst order rate parameter, k
1, and
a pseudo-second order sorption parameter, k, has also
been discussed.
Materials and Methods
Acid Blue 9, AB9, (was provided by Taiwan I-Hwa
Co. and Bayer Chemical Co.), solutions were preparedwith reverse osmosis treated water to make 500 ml ofsolutions at pH 3.0, which were maintained at a de-sired temperature prior to the experiment (Solution A).Activated carbon and activated clay (was purchasedfrom Laporte Industries Singapore Pte., Ltd.) had beenplaced in an oven for more than 24 hours, that wereaccurately weighed for a required amount and wereplaced in the stirring chamber containing 400 ml of re-verse osmosis treated water with pH adjusted to 3.0,and temperature was preset to a desired value. Theionic strength of the dye solution at pH 3.0 was ad-
justed to 0.02 M with sodium sulfate (Solution B). Be-fore mixing, 100 ml of Solution A was drawn for themeasurement of the initial dye concentration, C
0, while
the remaining 400 ml was immediately decanted intoSolution B for the sorption experiment. At intervals of0.5, 1, 2, 5, 30, 60 and 120 minutes, about 2 ml of thesample was drawn using a 20 ml syringe. It was thenﬁltered through a membrane ﬁlter (it was place in a ﬁl-
ter with a diameter of 25 mm, provide by Gelman Co.).The ﬁltrate was diluted with reverse osmosis treated
water for optical measurement. To study the effects ofexperimental parameters such as the initial dye concen-tration, the ratio of activated carbon to activated clay,pH, and temperature on AB9 sorption, we proceededby changing one parameter at a time while holding theothers constant.
Results and Discussion
Sorption IsothermThe equilibrium isotherm for the sorption of AB9 on
mixed sorbent was determined with 6.5 g mixed sor-bent, activated clay 6 g and carbon 0.5 g, with 0.8 dm

of dye solutions of various concentrations. The systemswere agitated for 2.5 hours in a constant temperatureusing water bath. The sorption process was con ﬁrmed
toﬁt with the following Langmuir isotherm:

The experimental points are shown in Fig. 1 and com-
pared with a solid Langmuir isotherm line, having acorrelation coef ﬁcient of 0.996 and equation:

Figure 1 also shows the operating line which is gen-
erated with a slope of solution volume/mass of mixedsorbent. The ﬁnal equilibrium solution concentration is
predicted from the point of intersection of the operat-ing line on the Langmuir isotherm, for the sorption ofAB9. The operation line is the line which predicts thetime dependence of a sorption process and integratesthis dependence into the equilibrium isotherm. The dyematerial balance equation for batch dynamic studies is:

for sorber design, with sorbate residence time and the
reactor dimensions controlled by the system ’s kinet-
ics. However, sorption kinetics show a large depen-dence on the physical and/or chemical characteristicsof the sorbent material which also in ﬂuences the sorp-
tion mechanism. In order to investigate the mechanismof sorption, the constants of sorption of dye were deter-mined to use equations of Lagergren (1898), a pseudo-ﬁrst order mechanism and equations of Ho (1995), a
pseudo-second order mechanism, respectively whichare as follows:
Pseudo-First Order Model. The sorption kinetics
may be described by a pseudo- ﬁrst order (Lagergren,
1898). The differential equation is the following:
dq
t
dt=k1(q1−qt) (6)
Integrating Eq. (6) for the boundary conditions t=0t o
t=tandqt=0t oqt=qt, gives:
log/parenleftbiggq1
q1−qt/parenrightbigg
=k1
2.303t (7)
which is the integrated rate law for a pseudo- ﬁrst or-
der reaction. Where q1is the amount of dye sorbed at
equilibrium, (mg g−1);qtis amount of dye sorbed at
time t, (mg g−1) and k1is the equilibrium rate constant
of pseudo- ﬁrst sorption, (min−1). Equation (7) can be
rearranged to obtain a linear form:
log(q1−qt)=log(q1)−k1
2.303t (8)
In order to obtain the rate constants, the straight line
plots of log (q1−qt)against tfor different experimental
conditions have been analysed. The rate constant, k1
and correlation coef ﬁcients, r2
1, values of the dye under
different conditions were calculated from these plots.Pseudo-Second Order Model. The sorption kinetics
may be described by a pseudo-second order (Ho, 1995).The differential equation is the following:
dq
t
dt=k(qe−qt)2(9)
Integrating Eq. (9) for the boundary condition t=0t o
t=tandqt=0t oqt=qt, gives:
1
(qe−qt)=1
qe+kt (10)
which is the integrated rate law for a pseudo-second
reaction. Where qeis amount of dye sorbed at equi-
librium (mg g−1) and kis the equilibrium rate constant
of pseudo-second order (g mg−1min−1). Equation (10)
can be rearranged to obtain a liner form:
t
qt=1
kq2e+1
qet (11)
The straight line plots of t/qtagainst thave been tested
to obtain rate parameters. The values of k,qeand corre-
lation coef ﬁcients, r2, of dye under different conditions
were calculated from these plots.
Effect of Initial Dye Concentration. A series of sorp-
tion using mixed sorbent, activated clay 6 g and carbon0.5 g, were carried out to study the in ﬂuence of initial
dye concentration. Figure 2 shows the removal of dyeincreased rapidly in the beginning and then more slowlyuntil the equilibrium. This was caused by strong attrac-tive forces between the dye molecules and the mixedsorbent, fast diffusion onto the external surface was fol-lowed by fast pore diffusion into the intraparticle matrixto attain rapid equilibrium (Asfour et al., 1985). Simi-lar results were reported in the removal of chrome dyeby mixed ﬂy ash and coal (Gupta et al., 1990). Linear

AB9 with the mixed sorbent for initial concentrations
ranging from 59.7 to 475 mg dm−3. Figure 4 shows
plots of qtagainst tfor the pseudo- ﬁrst order equation
for the sorption of AB9. The correlation coef ﬁcients,
r2, and the pseudo-second order rate parameters, k,
are shown and compared with r2
1andk1values for
the pseudo- ﬁrst order reaction mechanism (Table 2).
The data show a good compliance with the pseudo-second order equation and the regression coef ﬁcients
for the linear plots were higher than 0.999 for all thesystems.
The kinetics of AB9 sorption on the mixed sor-
bent follows the pseudo-second order rate expression.However, the mechanism of dye sorption has usuallybeen described by the pseudo- ﬁrst order Lagergren
equation (Low et al., 1995; Mittal and Gupta, 1996;Walker and Weatherley, 1999). The equilibrium sorp-tion capacity increased from 7.28 to 52.9 mg g
−1when
the initial concentration of AB9 increased from 59.7to 475 mg dm
−3, indicating that the dye removal is
dependent on initial concentration. However, the val-ues of the rate constant were found to decrease from1.34 to 2 .79×10
−2gm g−1min−1for an increase in the
initial concentration from 59.7 to 475 mg dm−3.Effect of Mass of Mixed Sorbent. The kinetic data
obtained from batch studies have been analysed usingpseudo- ﬁrst order model proposed by Lagergren (1898)
and the results shown in Table 3. The correlation co-efﬁcients, r
2, the pseudo-second order rate constant,
k, and equilibrium sorption capacity, qe, were calcu-
lated and presented in Table 3. It is evident that thekinetic of AB9 sorption on the mixed sorbent follows apseudo-second order rate expression. The results showthat the sorption capacity for AB9 increases from 39.9to 64.7 mg g
−1with the decrease in mass of the mixed
sorbent from 6.5 g to 2.5 g. It can be seen that removalincreases from 58.4% to 93.6% with the increase ofthe mixed sorbent doses from 2.5 g to 6.5 g for a giveninitial dye concentration (Table 3). This leads to theconclusion that, in order to obtain the optimum sor-bent dose, higher dye concentrations should be testedin conjunction with high doses. This indicates that withan increased mass of mixed sorbent, more surface areais made available and therefore the total number of sitesincreases.
Effect of Temperature. The sorption experiments
were repeated at various temperatures in the range ofSorption Studies of Acid Dye 145

activated clay/carbon system.

293 to 313 K with the mixed sorbent, activated clay
6 g and carbon 0.5 g. Table 4 shows that the equilib-rium sorption capacity of AB9 slightly decreases withincreasing temperature that indicates a low tempera-ture favors AB9 removal by sorption onto the mixedsorbent. This may be due to a tendency for the dyemolecules to escape from the solid phase to the bulkphase with an increase in temperature of the solution(Panday et al., 1984; Gupta et al., 1998). A similarobservation was also reported in the study on the sorp-tion of Basic Blue 3 on silica (Ahmed and Ram, 1992)and the sorption of lead onto china clay and wollas-tonite (Yadava et al., 1991). The results in Table 4show the correlation coef ﬁcients for the linear plots
Figure 5 . Plot of ln (k)against reciprocal temperature for AB9 sorption onto a mixed sorbent. Conditions: C0=300 mg dm−3, pH 3.0,
S=500 rpm and ms=6.5m gd m−3.from the pseudo-second order equation are extremely
high.
The values of rate constant, k, were found to slightly
decrease from 6 .68×10−2to 4.91×10−2gm g−1min−1
for an increase in solution temperature from 293 to
313 K for the sorption of AB9. A linear relation-ship between the pseudo rate constant and temper-ature was observed with a correlation coef ﬁcient of
0.992. The kvalues were plotted as a function of
the reciprocal of the Kelvin temperature. Linear vari-ations were observed as shown in Fig. 5. There-fore, the sorption rate constant may be expressed asa solution function of temperature by the followingrelationship:
k=k
0exp/parenleftbigg−E
RT/parenrightbigg
(12)
where kis the rate constant of sorption (g mg−1
min−1);k0is the temperature independent factor
(g mg−1min−1);Eis activation energy of sorption
(kJ mol−1);Ris the gas constant (8.314 J mol−1K−1);
Tis solution temperature (K).146 Ho and Chiang
Thus, the relationship between kandTcan be repre-
sented in an Arrhenius form as:
k=5.50×10−4exp/parenleftbigg11.7
8.314T/parenrightbigg
(13)
From this equation, the rate constants of sorption, k0,
is 5.50×10−4gm g−1min−1and the activation energy
of sorption, E,i s−11.7 kJ mol−1. Since sorption is
an exothermic process, it would be expected that anincrease in solution temperature would result in a de-crease in sorption capacity.
Effect of Initial pH. It is expected that the rate of
AB9 sorption onto the mixed sorbent will be varied withthe available pH values of solution when ion exchangedevelopment and applications is one of the sorptionprocesses. The pH values used in these studies are 2.0,3.0, 5.0, 7.0 and 9.0 for the sorption of AB9 with themixed sorbent, activated cla y 6 g and carbon 0.5 g.
The rate constant, k, and the equilibrium capacity, q
e,
of sorption at various pH values have been determinedand are listed in Table 5.
The removal of AB9 from aqueous solution by sorp-
tion is highly dependent on pH of the solution whichaffects the surface properties of the sorbent and dyestructure. The sorption capacity for AB9 of the mixedsorbent decreased from 41.1 to 29.7 mg g
−1when the
pH of the initial dye solution was increased from 2.0to 9.0 (Table 5). The extent of dye removal decreasedrapidly as pH was increased from pH 3.0 to 7.0. How-ever, the dye removal remained essentially constantwithin the pH range of 2.0 to 3.0 and 7.0 to 9.0. Thetrend was similar to the sorption of chrome dye onchina clay (Gupta et al., 1992) and the sorption of leadon kaolinitic clay (Orumwense, 1996). In addition, thesorption capacity of As(III) on china clay increaseswith an increase in pH within the range of 4.0 to 8.0(Yadava et al., 1988).

The kinetics of sorption of AB9 onto mixed sorbent,
activated clay and carbon (12:1) is studied on the basisof the pseudo- ﬁrst and pseudo-second order rate mech-
anism. The kinetics of AB9 sorption on the mixed sor-bent follows the pseudo-second order rate expression.A pseudo-second order model has been developed topredict the rate constant of sorption and the equilib-rium capacity. The activation energy of sorption can beevaluated using the pseudo-second order rate constants.The sorption of AB9 onto the mixed sorbent is favouredat higher concentrations of dye solution, low temper-atures and solution pH. The equilibrium data ﬁt well
in the Langmuir model of sorption, showing the for-mation of monolayer coverage of dye molecules at theouter surface of the sorbent. An equilibrium capacityof sorption has also been evaluated with the pseudo-second order rate equation as well as the Langmuirisotherm and operating line.
