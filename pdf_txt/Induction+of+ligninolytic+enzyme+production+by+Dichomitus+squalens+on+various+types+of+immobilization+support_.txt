Abstract:  Response surface methodology (central composite design of experiments) was 
employed to simultaneously optimize enzy me production and pr oductivities of two 
ligninolytic enzymes produced by Ceriporiopsis subvermispora . Concentrations of 
glucose, ammonium tartrate and Polysorbat e 80 were varied to establish the optimal 
composition of liquid media (OLM), where the hi ghest experimentally obtained activities 
and productivities were 41 U L−1 and 16 U L−1 day−1 for laccase (Lac), and 193 U L−1 and 
80 U L−1 day−1 for manganese peroxidase (MnP). C onsidering culture growth in OLM on 
various types of immobilization support, the best results were obtained with 1 cm beech 
wood cubes (BWCM). Enzyme activities in culture filtrate were 152 U L−1 for Lac and  
58 U L−1 for MnP, since the chemical composition of this immobilization material induced 
higher Lac activity. Lower enzyme activities  were obtained with polyurethane foam. 
Culture filtrates of OLM and BWCM were  applied for dye decolorization. Remazol 
Brilliant Blue R (RBBR) was decolorize d faster and more efficiently than 
Copper(II)phthalocyanine (CuP) with BWCM ( 80% and 60%), since Lac played a crucial 
role. Decolorization of CuP was initially fast er than that of RBBR, due to higher MnP 
activities in OLM. The extent of decolo rization after 14 h was 60% for both dyes. OPEN ACCESSInt. J. Mol. Sci.  2012 , 13 11366

1. Introduction 
Fungi are the main organisms responsible for wood biodegradation. Some species of 
basidiomycetes, the white-rot fungi, are able to effici ently degrade lignin [1]. In order to do that, they 
produce extracellular oxidative enzymes such as lac case (Lac), lignin peroxidi se (LiP) and manganese 
peroxidise (MnP) [2,3]. Their non-specific oxidative mechanism makes them us eful for a wide range 
of biotechnological applications in the pulp and paper industry and in bioremediation technologies for 
degradation of recalcitrant com pounds [4]. The basidiomycete C. subvermispora  is a well-known 
fungus in the bio-pulping and paper industry because  it is a selective ligni n degrader [5,6]. It is 
involved in the rare process of selective lignin degradation, wher e fungal enzymes remove lignin and 
non-cellulosic polysaccharides without extensive degradation of cellulo se itself [6,7]. The 
decomposition of lignin from various resources may consequently be achieved in an optimal manner 
and the resulting medium can effectiv ely be utilized as a substrate in  bioethanol or biogas producing 
fermentations following less demanding upstream processing. 
Optimization of the culture medium for ligni nolytic enzyme produc tion and synthetic dye 
decolourization using response surface methodology in terms of Lac and MnP activity was first studied 
by Trupkin et al.  with the wood-decay fungus Trametes trogii  [8]. The Plackett–Burman experimental 
design was utilized to evaluate nut ritional requirements [9]. In recen t years, the pertinent Lac and MnP 
activities were subseque ntly optimized using response surf ace methodology for white-rot wood-decay 
and other fungi as well, such as Pleurotus ostreatus  [10,11], Trametes versicolor  [12],  
Panus tigrinus  [13], Bjerkandera adusta  [14]. Lac and MnP were predominantly produced using 
submerged liquid fermentation [8–14] 
Filamentous fungi have a natural in clination to adhere to  surfaces. This can be successfully utilised 
in various types of bioreactors with immobilized biomass, for example in packed bed bioreactors, 
rotating disc bioreactors and biofilm reactor s [15–17]. For enzyme production, the chemical 
composition of the supporting material offering a su rface for growth is especi ally important because  
it affects fungal activities. It  was found that various type s of wood with different  
physicochemical composition have diverse effect s on enzyme production during cultivation of  
Ganoderma Lucidum [18,19]. It was indicated that beech wood as an immobilization support induced 
Lac production with Dichomitus squalens  better than polyurethane foam since natural lignin acts as an 
inducer [20]. In our previous study with C. subvermispora  it was shown that various ratios of Lac and 
MnP activities can be induced by varying the me dia composition during cult ivation on beech wood, 
which was the best wood support compared to pine and oak [21]. 
The aim of this study was to optimize the lignino lytic enzyme activity and production rate and to 
test the ability of the enzymes obtained to decolouri ze various synthetic dyes. The first part of the work 
was dedicated to the study of the optimization of  the liquid media. Response surface methodology was Int. J. Mol. Sci.  2012 , 13 11367  
 
 applied to simultaneously optimize the activit y of two lignin-modifying enzymes produced by 
Ceriporiopsis subvermispora , namely Lac and MnP. This may a llow for the optimization of a batch 
growth medium to tailor the activities of bot h enzymes simultaneously. Consequently, for each 
enzyme, optimization was performed using the same  methodology, for both the enzyme activity and its 
corresponding production rate (productivity), defined as the increase in enzyme  activity with process 
time. In the second part of the study, natural funga l characteristics were used to enhance enzyme 
production by growing it on an immob ilization support. According to the literature data [20,21],  
beech-wood was used here as a promising induci ng material. After maximizing the production rate 
alone, the best combination of optimized grow th medium composition a nd immobilization support 
should be chosen in the case of either continuous or chemostat-mode process operation. This process 
could be applied in order to pot entially facilitate th e scaling-up of Lac and MnP production to the 
continuous level on the one hand, while, on the othe r hand, to keep the growth medium composition 
relatively simple and well-defined. Therefore, vari ous enzyme inducers and mediators were used as 
components of the immobilization suppor t to obtain the optimal enzyme effi ciency rather than as a part 
of the growth medium. The enzymes produced were used in a decolorization study of two different 
synthetic dyes to test the suitability  of the proposed tw o step strategy. 
2. Results and Discussion 
In this study the response surface methodology was used to simultaneously optimize the production 
of two lignin-modifying enzymes (Lac and MnP) produced by C. subvermispora . For each enzyme, the 
optimization was performed using the same me thodology for both the enzyme activity and its 
corresponding production rate. In order to optimize the model consis ting of two factors that needed to 
be improved simultaneously (the maximal enzyme ac tivity and its maximal production rate) as a single 
system response, the Objective Functions ( OF Lac and OF MnP) for batch experiments were expressed by:

where ([ ELac])max and ([ EMnP])max are the highest values of the experimentally obtained maximal Lac

OF MnP could not be optimized due to the absence of local maxima within reasonable substrate 
concentration values (the combined measurement a nd estimation error was too large). Nonetheless, a 
new Objective Function ( OF Lac/MnP ) for batch experiments was defined as:

In order not to introduce too many variables to th e design of experiments, as the three crucial 
independent variables, pertinent to enzyme pro duction, two principal nutrients (carbon and nitrogen 
source —glucose (1) and ammonium tartra te (2), respectively) and Polysorbate 80 (3), a non-ionic 
surfactant and emulsifier, were chosen. In Figure 1, the influence of medium components specifically; 
glucose ( x1), ammonium tartrate ( x2) and Polysorbate 80 ( x3), on the combined activity and 
productivity of Lac ( OF Lac) is presented. In Figure 1a–c the Lac activity has a lower contribution 
(0.25) to the overall objective f unction (Equation 1) than the Lac productivity (0. 75), whereas its 
impact gradually increases through Figure 1d–f ( w = 0.50) and 1g–i ( w = 0.75). Int. J. Mol. Sci.  2012 , 13 11369  
 
 Figure 1.  Estimated response surface for OF Lac (the contribution of relative laccase (Lac) 
activity to OF Lac (w) was set at ( a–c) 0.25, ( d–f) 0.50 and ( g–i) 0.75), on varying the initial 
glucose ( x1), ammonium tartrate ( x2) and Polysorbate 80 ( x3) concentrations for batch 
experiments at a temperature of 30 °C. 
 
The first observation which can be drawn is that the general shape of the response surfaces remains 
approximately the same, regardless of  the fraction of the Lac activity ( w) and productivity (1 − w) in 
the overall response ( OF Lac), the latter of course being dependent on w. Correspondingly, there is an 
optimum in Lac activity ([ ELac])/productivity (d[ ELac]/dt) at the specific glucose ( x1) and ammonium 
tartrate ( x2) concentrations at the fixed Polysorbate 80 level ( x3 = 0.5, CP = 0.55 g L−1), meaning that at 
lower concentrations both medium components pr omote enzyme production, whereas an additional 
increase in concentrations results in an inhibitory effect. The research of C. subvermispora  in 
biotechnological applicati ons revealed the obtained Lac activities around 75 U L−1 and MnP activities 
around 40 U L−1 after 5 and 14 days of inc ubation, respectively, in a MPG (malt extract, peptone, and 
glucose) medium at 25 °C [22]. Enzyme production by C. subvermispora  is regulated by nitrogen and 
Int. J. Mol. Sci.  2012 , 13 11370  
 
 glucose concentrations in the me dium [23–25]. With a gr owth limiting amount of nitrogen source  
(0.2 g L−1), the fungus C. subvermispora  produces low levels of both enzymes compared to a medium 
with a sufficient nitrogen s ource concentration (2.0 g L−1). The same pattern was found with a carbon 
source. The fungus produced high leve ls of both enzymes (about 500 U L−1 of MnP and 400 U L−1 of 
Lac, respectively, between two and three weeks of cultivation at 30 °C) at high carbon concentrations 
(10 g L−1 glucose) and low levels at 1.0 g L−1 of glucose in a medium with sufficient nitrogen 
concentration (2.0 g L−1) [23]. The enzyme activities obtained by Ruttimann-Johnson et al.  were 
higher in comparison to the ones, presented in th is study, nonetheless; the enzyme production rates in 
this study are comparable if not even higher [23] . For a technological enzyme  production process the 
productivity is of a primordial interest, most freque ntly it is at least comparably important to the 
enzyme activity itself. This observation is somewhat  different from the one indicated in Figure 1. An 
explanation might be that the above mentioned au thors did not examine th e effect of carbon source 
(glucose) concentration over the entire range, but we re limited to either its low or high values. 
Considering Figure 1a,d,g, one could reach the same  conclusion, if only two points were compared on 
the response surface at a fixed nitrogen source concentratio n (ammonium tartrate) level ( x2). On the 
other hand, the experimental  conditions were not exactly the same in the present study as in the work 
reported by Ruttimann-Johnson et al.  [23], as the latter omitted a su rfactant in the growth medium. 
Thus, the concentration of glucose which would suppress enzyme producti on was not established; 
nonetheless, it might well exist within their studied range of  concentrations of 1–10 g L−1 [23] or be 
even higher. Considering our results, the locus of optimal Lac activity/productivity ( OF Lac) in terms of 
glucose and ammonium tartrate co ncentration varies with the contribution of Lac activity to the 
response, but not significantly (Figure 1a,d,g) , implying that medium levels of glucose  
(2–6 g L−1) and tartrate (0.8–1.2 g L−1) are favourable for both the ac tivity and productivity of Lac. 
The latter is pertinent to  industrial processes where relatively hi gh yield and rate need to be obtained 
concurrently. However, extremely high yield an d rate cannot be achieved simultaneously, as OF Lac in 
Figure 1a,d,g does not exceed unity, meaning that th ere is a certain reduction in Lac productivity on 
account of its higher activity, and vice versa. 
In the production of enzymes, especially in large-scale processing, antifoaming agents and 
surfactants are normally used. Poly sorbate 80 (Tween 80) is a non-ioni c surfactant that is helpful in 
releasing fungal enzymes to the ex ternal environment. Although Polyso rbate 80 is of low toxicity to 
the cellular membrane, it can alter the structure and morphology of f ungi and the bacterial cell wall, 
leading to an increase of protein secretion [26]. Figure 2 shows the in fluence of Polysorbate 80 on the 
activity of Lac and MnP for the fungus C. subvermispora  in a shaken flask experiment. The initial 
concentrations of nitrogen a nd carbon sources were 5.50 g L−1 for glucose and 1.05 g L−1 for 
ammonium tartrate. Lac and MnP activities in the f iltrate are 10 times higher in the presence of a low 
concentration of Polysorbate 80 (0.1 g L−1). The results thus showed that  Polysorbate 80 could be used 
as a stimulatory agent in submerged fungal cultiv ation, but in low concentr ations. Figure 1b,c,e,f,h,i 
(model predictions) also show that either at fixed glucose ( x1 = 0.5, CG = 5.50 g L−1) or ammonium 
tartrate concentrations ( x2 = 0.5, CDT = 1.05 g L−1), the concentration of Polysorbate 80 ( x3) should be 
as low as possible. The dependence on nitrogen or carbon source exhibits a maximum. The latter is 
again within medium leve ls of glucose (2–6 g L−1) and ammonium tartrate (0.8–1.2 g L−1). Int. J. Mol. Sci.  2012 , 13 11371

tartrate concentration of 1.05 g L−1, and an initial Polysorbate 80 concentration ( CP) of  
1.00 g L−1 (lower curves) and 0.10 g L−1 (upper curves).  
 
The response surface methodology wa s less successful in describi ng the activity/productivity of 
MnP, e.g., the results implied that  the optimal MnP activity/productiv ity would be obtained in the 
absence of a nitrogen source. Error analysis sugges ted that this was not a re sult of the modelling step 
of the RSM procedure (configure Experimental  Section), but of the experimental phase —the 
production of MnP by C. subvermispora  was poorly repeatable. However, there was a certain 
correlation with Lac produc tion, and hence the corrected objective function ( OF Lac/MnP ) was defined 
through Equation 3 for simultaneous optimization of both Lac and MnP activity. In addition to this, 
even though a poorer predictability  of the model for MnP activity and productivity may be observed 
through lower values of R2 (the latter indicates explained variability) and Q2 (the latter indicates 
predicted variability) coefficients (presented in the continuation), the latter may be considered 
acceptable. Moreover, the predictability of th e new (corrected) Objective Function for the 
simultaneous optimization of both Lac and MnP activity is more than acceptable on account of 
excellent predictability for Lac and an average one for MnP.  
Subsequently, sensitivity anal ysis was performed on the quadr atic model utilized and its 
corresponding parameters (the parameters in Equa tion 2 and Table 2), estimated by linear regression. 
Cohen’s f2 was used to measure the effect size of  individual contributio ns in the model ( x1, the initial 
glucose, x2, ammonium tartrate, and x3, Polysorbate 80 concentration, y1, y2, y3, and y3 dependent 
variables), while the F-test was used as a statistical test to determine which effects were within the 
95% confidence interval margin  (dotted line in Figure 3). 
Figure 3a reveals that gluc ose as a carbon source ( x1) and ammonium tartrate  as a nitrogen source 
(x2) both exhibit a positive effect on Lac activity ( y1, [ELac]), the latter larger. The effect of the 
Polysorbate 80 quadratic term ( x3 x3) on Lac activity, on the other hand, is negative and predominant. 
The quadratic term would imply a sta tionary point in the dependence of [ ELac] on x3, but  
Figure 1b,c,e,f, 1h, and 1i show no su ch occurrences. The stationary po int thus probably lies outside 
the presented range, and therefore the joint e ffect of the linear and quadratic term of x3 could have 
Int. J. Mol. Sci.  2012 , 13 11372  
 
 been approximated by linearization. A nother feature of interest lies in the fact that the influences of 
carbon source, nitrogen source, and surfactant seem to  be independent, as the interdependence terms 
(x1 x2, x1 x3, and x2 x3) in Figure 3a are negligible, the synerg istic effect of gl ucose and ammonium 
tartrate ( x1 x2 (+)) being the largest of them . The dependences on glucose ( x1) and ammonium tartrate 
(x2) in Figure 1 nevertheless reveal local maxima.

 The maxima in Lac activity/productivity ( OF Lac) as a function of glucose ( x1) and ammonium 
tartrate ( x2) concentrations in Figure 1 may therefore be predominantly ascribed to the contribution of 
Lac productivity ( y2, d[ELac]/dt). Lac productivity is thus noticeably affected by the inhibitory effect of 
glucose ( x1 x1 (−)) and the positive combined gluc ose/ammonium tartrate effect ( x1 x2 (+)) (Figure 3b). 
The latter two, along w ith the linear terms, are responsib le for the maxima in the Lac 
activity/productivity. The effect of ammonium tartrate on Lac productivity  is analogous to that which it 
has on its activity; specifically, it is positive and notable in its influence. Lastly, Polysorbate 80 ( x3) 
principally affects productivity, as well as ac tivity; the productivity  both in the linear ( −) and quadratic 
(+) terms. The overall effect of the surfactant on productivit y is the same as that which it asserts on 
activity, namely negative. Other e ffects had negligible influence. 
The optimization of the quadratic model utilized ensued , where the model parameters were 
estimated by linear regression. The objective function, constituted from enzyme (Lac and MnP) 
activity and production rate, was maximized  for variable port ions of either, w. Parameters (the optimal 
initial medium concentrations x1, x2, and x3) were estimated by nonlin ear regression, namely the 
Levenberg −Marquardt algorithm (10−5 tolerance). 
Figure 4 shows the optimal values of two objective functions, ( OF Lac) Lac activity and productivity, 
and ( OF Lac/MnP ) Lac and MnP activities, which were maximized simultaneously, with variable 
contributions of Lac activity ( w) to the objective func tion. In the first case one may observe that 
although the overall objective function OF Lac assumes its greatest value (1.17) at w = 0 due to high Lac 
productivity, Lac activity is  greatly decreased (only 40% of the highest experi mental value). As the 
contribution to Lac activity in OF Lac, w, increases, Lac activity ( y1,Lac) first abruptly and then gradually 
increases towards 1.14, while c oncurrently Lac productivity ( y2,Lac) exhibits a rather  small decrease,  
from 1.17 to 1.00. This would imply that, with th e exception of very rare cases when the maximal 
productivity would be attained regard less of the relatively low activity ( w = 0, OF Lac = 1.17), continuous 
systems should preferably be operated in conditions of the highest activity and only slightly decreased 
productivity ( w = 1, OF Lac = 1.14), or at least in this vicinity. Of course, another aspect to consider is the 
concentration of medium compone nts at which distinct levels of activity or productivity may  
be achieved. 
Simultaneously optimizing Lac and MnP activities ( OF Lac/MnP ) reveals that it is difficult to obtain 
high levels of both Lac and MnP, respectively, since for high MnP concentrations ( w→0), Lac activity 
decreases basically to zero. On th e other hand, upon obtaining high La c concentrations (114% of the 
highest experimental value), MnP activity may be ma intained at an intermediate level (63% of the 
highest experimental value). 
Examples of initial glucose, ammonium tartrate, and Polysorbate 80 concentrations for the optimal 
Lac activity and productivity ( OF Lac) and Lac and MnP activities ( OF Lac/MnP ) are presented in  
Tables 3–5 and Figures 5 and 6. In all cases the ab sence of the surfactant s hould increase both enzyme 
activity and productivity. The in termediate concentrations of  carbon and nitrogen sources 
corresponded to the maxima exhibited by the respons e surfaces in Figure 1. The optimization results 
had to be verified (Experimental Section) to validate if omitting the surfactant in the medium 
formulation was indeed favourable fo r enzyme activity and productivity.

According to the model there should preferab ly not be any surfactant in the medium. The 
implication of the fact that the hi ghest Lac activity and productivity are predicted by the model in the 
absence of Polysorbate 80 is on the one hand favour able, thus avoiding an a dditional component in the 
medium and directly decreases cost; furthermore,  this could decrease downstream processing and 
potential contamination of crude filtrates as well.  Nonetheless, verificatio n experiments showed a 
discrepancy between model and e xperimental data, implying that the range of Polysorbate 80 
concentrations examined may have been too br oad. Consequently, a series of experiments was 
undertaken varying only the surfactan t concentration in th e region below the lowest concentration of 
0.3 g L−1. The results, which were obtaine d with optimum settings for OF Lac/MnP  at w = 0.5 (Table 6), 
clearly indicate an extremely low optimal surfact ant concentration, which was determined as  
Int. J. Mol. Sci.  2012 , 13 11376  
 
 0.05 g L−1. Accordingly, the following conclusion may be drawn. The model describes well the 
dependence of Lac activity and productivity within  the examined broad range of concentrations 
examined; nonetheless it would be prudent to repeat  the procedure, illustrat ed in the Experimental 
Section, for a narrow window of Polysorbate 80 concen trations in order to achieve better accuracy, 
especially as far as the decisive  surfactant concentration is concer ned. Thus, the differences between 
the measured and the predicted values in Table 6 save for ([ EMnP])max at CP = 0 g L−1 arise because of 
the broadly examined range of factors (glucose, a mmonium tartrate, and Polysorbate 80 in Table 1) —If 
parameters were estimated in a narrower range, the optimization would be more  accurate; nonetheless, 
the overall accuracy in the broader range of concen trations would be poorer. Even so, the discrepancy 
between predicted and experimental  laccase production does not confirm the low reliability for this 
enzyme production, even more the reliability of the predicted laccase production is very high for the 
studied broad range of nutrient concentrations; on ly for a more accurate optimization were the 
additional measurements conducted. In general, the good predictability of th e model for Lac activity 
and productivity may be observed through relatively high values of R2 (the latter indicates explained 
variability) and Q2 (the latter indicates pr edicted variability) coeffici ents, which were 0.875 and 0.872 
(R2), and 0.608 and 0.623 ( Q2) for Lac activity and produc tivity, correspondingly. A poorer 
predictability of the model for MnP activity and pr oductivity may be observed through lower values of 
R2 and Q2 parameters, which were 0.686 and 0.795 ( R2), and 0.339 and 0.468 ( Q2) for MnP activity 
and productivity, correspondingly. Th e objective function (use d in the model), using which we aimed 
to optimize the production, is indeed extremely useful , but in point of fact implies good predictability 
of the model (e.g.,  high Q2). The reported coefficients dem onstrate this for Lac activity and 
productivity, but not for the case of MnP.

The second phase of the study continued with C. subvermispora cultivation experiments on various 
immobilization supports using the optimized liqui d medium (OLM). Beech wood cubes (BWCM) and 
pine wood cubes (PWCM) containi ng natural lignin as inducer and inert polyurethane foam cubes 
(PUFCM) were used to immobilize the culture grow th and to control the immobilization effect in 
comparison to the combined effect of the other s upports that act as carriers as well as inducers.  
The composition of the liquid media was prep ared according to the optimum settings for OF Lac/MnP  at 
w = 0.5 obtained from the response surface methodol ogy experiment. In addition, the OLM was used Int. J. Mol. Sci.  2012 , 13 11377  
 
 as a reference medium with free mycelium. Th e results are presented in Figure 7. The maximal 
enzyme activities with free mycelium in the OLM without immobilization support were achieved after 
eight days, namely 108 U L−1 for MnP and 19 U L−1 for Lac. It is evident that the use of wood supports 
affected the enzyme activities. Beech wood and pine wood induced higher Lac activities. Maximal 
values using BWCM and PWCM, achieved afte r eight days of cultivation, were 150 U L−1 and  
135 U L−1, respectively. In contrast, MnP activities us ing wood supports were lower than the results 
with only liquid medium OLM, namely 60 U L−1 for BWCM and 20 U L−1 for PWCM. Production of 
enzymes was the lowest under PUFCM cultivation conditions: MnP activity was only 40 U L−1, while 
Lac activity was close to zero (2 U L−1). In the literature it was report ed that inert materials such as 
PUF affect fungal growth as an immobilizati on surface, but alone cannot increase enzyme  
synthesis [16,20]. In contrast, natural materials su ch as straw or wood with structural cell-wall 
components like cellulose, hemicellu loses and lignin form carbon sources  available for fungal growth. 
In addition, wood contains small amounts of soluble sugars, lipids, peptides and starch as well as 
minerals and a wide range of extrac tives and volatiles. All these com pounds vary with tree species like 
pine, beech or oak and therefore affect fungal grow th and enzyme production in different ways [27]. 
Hence, they can be utilized bot h as an immobilization surface a nd a natural inducer [20,21]. Present 
results are also in agreement with our previous investigation, where the s ynthesis of ´tailor made` 
enzyme composition, that is excess Lac or excess MnP, was proposed by variation of the carbon and 
nitrogen source in the medium and the use of imm obilization supports of diffe rent types of wood [21].

with beech wood cubes (BWCM), pine wood cubes (PWCM) and inert polyurethane  
cubes (PUFCM) as immobilization support; the maximal enzyme activities were obtained 
after eight days. 
 
Further, the mixture of ligninolytic enzymes produced by the white rot fungus C. subvermispora  
could be used in environmental ap plications, in the pape r industry and also for the decolourization of 
synthetic dyes [1,4,15,17]. In our inves tigation, we tested the possible applicability of the ligninolytic 
enzyme mixture produced in BWCM and OLM for deco lourization of the two structurally different 
Int. J. Mol. Sci.  2012 , 13 11378  
 
 dyes Remazol Brilliant Blue (RBBR)  and Copper (II) phthalocyanin e (CuP). The decolorization of 
RBBR was faster and more efficient than that of CuP with the enzyme mixtu re from BWCM (80% and 
60% decolorization in  approximately 8 and 12 h, respectively). We assumed that Lac played a crucial 
role in the decolorization of this dye (Figure 8). Ou r results show that CuP is more difficult to degrade 
with Lac than RBBR. This effect was alrea dy documented during a study of the fungus  
Dichomitus squalens  [20]. A similar result, that decoloriza tion of anthraquinonic dy es is easier with 
laccases produced by white rot fungi, wa s also reported in the work by Liu et al . [28]. The 
decolorization of CuP was initially faster than that  of RBBR, probably due to  higher MnP activities in 
the OLM. When filtrates with lower Lac activiti es and higher MnP were used for decolorization 
studies, such as the filtrate fr om OLM in this study, the compensa tion and cooperation of these two 
enzymes in the decolorization process could be implied. These findings were suggested during dye 
degradation studies with Lac and MnP from D. squalens  [29]. The extent of decolorization after  
14 h was 60% for both enzyme mixtures in BW CM and OLM (Figure 9). The results of our 
decolorization study with the C. subvermispora  ligninolytic enzyme system show the potential use of 
this fungus for environmental protection and biorem ediation of pollutants. However, in the future 
during the enzymatic degradation studies, more attenti on should be paid to the analysis of the products 
appearing during enzyme degradation.

3. Experimental Section 
3.1. Microorganism 
The fungus strain Ceriporiopsis subvermispora CBS 347.63 was obtained from the CBS culture 
collection (Centraalbureau voor Sc himmelcultures, Utrecht, The Netherlands). The strain was 
maintained on 5% malt extract agar (MEA) at 4 °C as described previously [20]. 
3.2. Batch Experiments 
The mycelial suspension was prepared as previously described by Babi č and Pavko [21]. The 
shaken cultures were prepared by inoculating 100 mL of the basal culture medium [30] with 5% ( v/v) 
of the mycelial suspension. Glucose, ammonium tartrate and Polyso rbate 80 concentrations in the basal 
culture medium were varied as shown in Tabl e 1. The fungus was incubated on a RVI-403 rotary 
shaker (Tehtnica, Železniki, Slovenia) at 30 °C at  a constant agitation of  150 rpm. Aliquots of the 
liquid culture were collected for de termination of extracellular Lac a nd MnP activities. As well as in 
the design of experiments in which the central point is repeated, the other experiments were performed 
in triplicate and consequen tly with high reliability. 
3.3. Enzyme Activity 
Laccase (Lac) activity was measured by monitori ng the oxidation of a 5 mM solution of  
2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothi ozoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) as the increase in absorbance at  
420 nm [31], and manganese peroxidase (MnP) activity by monitoring th e oxidation of 20 mM 
solution of 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (DMP) as the increase  in absorbance at 469 nm [32]. One unit of 
enzyme activity was defined as the amount of the enzyme oxidizing 1 μmol of the corresponding 
Int. J. Mol. Sci.  2012 , 13 11380  
 
 substrate per minute. All spectrophotometric measur ements were carried out using a Perkin Elmer 
spectrophotometer, type Lambda 25 (USA). The subs trates for the Lac and MnP activity assays were 
both purchased from Sigma (USA). 
3.4. Response Surface Methodology  
To optimize the medium composition with regard to Lac and MnP activity and their productivity, 
surface response methodology for enzyme activity and productivity was utilized. Central composite 
design (CCD) (orthogonal) was used applying full factorial, the in scribed type of design, and no 
limitations of the maximal block size. Although CCD is  a really useful appro ach for the optimization 
of enzyme production processes it cannot always be successfully appl ied using fungi; to overcome this 
possible problem we repeated in triplicate the expe riment of the CCD. Modelling, sensitivity analysis 
and optimization was performed with Matlab R2011a  software. The coded values in the central 
composite design matrix were transformed into real  values using minimal and maximal concentration 
values of 1.0 g L−1 and 10.0 g L−1 for glucose, 0.1 g L−1 and 2.0 g L−1 for ammonium tartrate, and  
0.1 g L−1 and 1.0 g L−1 for Polysorbate 80, the real values be ing presented in Table 1. A schematic 
diagram of the RSM procedure is la id out in Figure 10, its main st eps being response surface design, 
experiment, modelling, sensitivity analys is, optimization and verification [8–14].

 where yi is either the maximal Lac activity ( i = 1) or its maximal production rate ( i = 2) and either the 
maximal MnP activity ( i = 3) or its maximal production rate ( i = 4), ai0, aij, ai12, ai13, ai23 and aijj are

coefficients for a complete description of the behavior of either the maximal Lac activity ( i = 1) or its 
maximal production rate ( i = 2) and either the maximal MnP activity ( i = 3) or its maximal production 
rate ( i = 4). The coefficients  aij, ai12, ai13, ai23 and aijj correspond to independent variables; specifically, 
the initial glucose ( j = 1, x1), ammonium tartrate ( j = 2, x2) and Polysorbate 80 ( j = 3, x3) 
concentrations. Both  the independent ( yi) and dependent ( xj) variables were norma lized, that is divided 
by their maximal values, so that they  would be within  the range of 0–1. 
3.5. Experiments on Immobilization Supports 
Immobilized cultures were grown in optimized liquid medium (OLM) on 1 cm3 pine (PWCM), 
beech (BWCM) and polyurethane (PUFCM) cu bes for 14 days. The OLM contained 10 g L−1 glucose, 
1 g L−1 ammonium tartrate and 0.05 g L−1 Polysorbate 80 in the basal culture medium. In order to 
prepare the solid support for fungal colonization, PUF cubes were washed  three times with hot distilled 
water to remove all foreign matter and air dried. Th e cubes were autoclaved in 150 mL of OLM in  
250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks. After autoclaving, 50 mL of the medium was remove d and the rest of it 
was inoculated with 5% ( v/v) of the mycelium suspension. Aliquots of  the culture liquid were collected 
for determination of extracel lular Lac and MnP activities. 
3.6. Dyes and Dye Decolourization 
Dye decolourization was calculated by compari ng the absorbance, measured at the maximum 
absorbance wavelength for each compound, during the de colorization treatment. The dyes used in this 
study were Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR, an anthraquinone dye), λmax = 592 nm, and 
Copper(II)phthalo-cyanine (CuP; a phthalo-cyanine dye), λmax = 694 nm. Both dyes were purchased 
from Sigma (USA). 
For in vitro dye decolorization by the crude culture liquid, culture filtrates obtained from cultivation 
cultures of C. subvermispora  in OLM and in BWCM were used. The reaction mixtures consisted of 
100 mM Na-tartrate buffer, pH 4.5, 50 mg L−1 dye and 100 μL of crude culture liquid in a final volume 
of 1 mL. Dye decolorization was m easured continuously using a Perk in Elmer spectrophotometer, type 
Lambda 25 (USA) [21].  
4. Conclusions 
In fungal cultures medium optimization should play an important role in the upstream process due 
to the consequent lowering of process costs. The activity and productivity of  ligninolytic enzymes 
from C. subvermispora  in submerged cultures and their dependence on medium composition can be 
well described by response surface methodology (RSM ) over a broad range of concentrations. For 
better accuracy, some repetition of the RSM procedure should be performed. 
A two-step strategy, that is, liqui d media optimization first and then  selection of an appropriate 
immobilization support to induce the enzyme activities,  was successful in increasing Lac activities. It Int. J. Mol. Sci.  2012 , 13 11382  
 
 was shown that the methodology of liquid medium op timization can be readily utilized for a wide 
range of compositions for pred icting both ligninolytic enzyme  activity and production rate 
simultaneously and relatively accurately. Therefore, a major advantage of the proposed approach is 
that it may be usefully applied for systems in whic h as high activity as possi ble is desired to avoid 
downstream separation and purification costs, or fo r those processes in which maximizing the enzyme 
production rate is imperative, namely in continuous  processes. Balancing these two contributions 
allows for intermediate regimes in which both the activity and production rate play an important role. 
Despite the fact that the methodology was applied fo r a specific medium (gluco se, ammonium tartrate, 
and Polysorbate 80) its app licability may be ex tended to other components as well. 
The natural tendency of filamentous fungi to adhere to surfaces was successfu lly applied to increase 
Lac activity in the second step of the study. Natura lly an immobilization mate rial with appropriate 
chemical composition which affects fungal activities and induces enzyme  activities should be used for 
this purpose. This principle, which was used here fo r enzyme production in batch stationary cultures, is 
already well recognized for enzyme synthesis in  various types of biorea ctors with immobilized 
biomass, for example in packed bed bioreactors, rotating disc bioreactors and biofilm reactors.  
It was shown that ligninolytic enzymes, namely  manganese peroxidase (MnP) and laccase (Lac), 
produced by the white rot fungus C. subvermispora  can be successfully used  for decolorization of 
synthetic dyes. In addition, th ey also have good potential for use in other bioremediation and 
environmental protection applicatio ns, as well as in lignin breakdown.
