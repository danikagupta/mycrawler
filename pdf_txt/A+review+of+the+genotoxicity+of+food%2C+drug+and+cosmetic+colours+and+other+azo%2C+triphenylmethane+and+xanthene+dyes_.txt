SCCNFP/0495/01, final
OPINION OF THE SCIENTIFIC COMMITTEE ON COSMETIC PRODUCTS AND NON-FOOD
PRODUCTS INTENDED FOR CONSUMERS
CONCERNING
THE SAFETY REVIEW OF THE USE OF CERTAIN AZO-DYES
IN COSMETIC PRODUCTS
adopted by the SCCNFP during the 19th plenary meeting
of 27 February 2002SCCNFP/0495/01, final
Safety review of the use of certain azo-dyes in cosmetic products
 _____________________________________________________________________________________________
21. Background
The input of the SCCNFP was requested concerning the review of the safety profile of four azo
dyes (CI 12150, CI 20170, CI 26100 and CI 27290) that are currently approved for use incosmetic products marketed in the EU.
The use of colorants in cosmetic products market ed in the EU is regulated through the provisions
of Annex IV of Directive 76/768/EEC, ‘List of colouring agents allowed for use in cosmetic
products’. Only those materials which are listed in  this Annex can be used in cosmetic products
marketed in the EU, subject to the restrictions given in the listings.
The safety of these four azo-dyes has been qu estioned. The rationale for this review is on the
basis that these colorants form carcinogenic amines during metabolism. The EuropeanCommission has been asked to revoke th e positive listing of these colorants.
2. Mandate
It was requested that the SCCNFP reviewed the safety of the following azo dyes :
CI 12150, CI 20170, CI 26100 and CI 27290.
The SCCNFP was requested to give an opinion on the following questions :
* Does the safety profile of these four ma terials support their current positive listing under 
Annex IV of the cosmetics Directive 76/768/ EEC and the subsequent utilisation of the 
colorants in cosmetic products under current uses and practices?
* Does the SCCNFP recommend a dditional restrictions on the use of these colorants in 
cosmetic products?
3. Opinion on the SCCNFP
This paper will focus only on mutagenicity a nd carcinogenicity (SCCN FP/0474/01) of the azo-
dyes. Furthermore, this report is based on published literature. 
3.1. Azo dyes
Azo compounds are by far the most widely used synthetic organic colorants. The Colour Index
lists more than 2000 azo compounds. Azo dyes ar e generally synthesised starting from primary
aromatic amines by diazotisati on and coupling with e.g. phenols or secondary aromatic amines.
The commercial products often contai n high levels of other compone nts, especially relevant from
a toxicological point of view are aromatic amines as contaminants.SCCNFP/0495/01, final

33.2. Mutagenicity of azo dyes
The genetic toxicology of some azo dyes ha s been reviewed (Combes, Haveland-Smith 1982).
Structure-activity relationships were assessed (Chung, Cerniglia  1992, Chung et al. 2000). It has
been demonstrated that sulphonated derivatives  (aromatic aminosulphonic acids) generally have
no or very low genotoxic potential (Jung et al . 1992). A protocol for testing azo dyes for
mutagenic activity in Salmonella typhimurium was developed including the use of flavine
mononucleotide rather than ribofla vine and hamster liver S9 fo r metabolic activ ation (Prival,
Mitchell 1982).
3.2 Carcinogenicity of azo dyes
Table 1 is a compilation of organic colorants whic h are recognised to be carcinogens. With the
exception of 2 compounds all these colorants ar e azo dyes. Furthermore, in many European
countries, e.g. in Germany, it is generally acc epted that all azo dyes which may be split into
carcinogenic aromatic amines are possible ca rcinogens and may not be used any more in
consumer products (Technische Regeln für Gefahrstoffe, TRGS 614, Technical rules for
hazardous substances). In its opinion on the risk  of cancer caused by textiles and leather goods
coloured with azo-dyes the CSTEE came to th e conclusion that the concern from the point of
view of carcinogenic risk should apply to a ll azo dyes which have the potential to undergo in
vivo reduction to carcinogenic ar omatic amines (CSTEE 1999).
3.3. Metabolism of azo dyes
The significance of azo-reduction in the mutage nesis and carcinogenesis of azo dyes is well
established. In mammals, they  are metabolised to the corresponding amines following
incorporation. In the mammalian liver azo co mpounds are metabolised by cytosolic and
microsomal enzymes, e.g. by reductive cleavage to the amines. The intestinal microflora plays aneven more important role (e.g. Bartsc h 1981, Chung 1983, Chung and Cerniglia 1992, Chung et
al. 1992, Chung et al. 2000, Levine 1991). 
The reductive cleavage of azo dyes during percutanous absorption was investigated in vitro using
skin from mice, guinea pigs, and humans. All spec ies tested were capable of reductive cleavage
of the dyes (Collier et al. 1993). Follo wing epicutaneous treatment of rats in vivo with a 14C-
labelled azo dye, a significant amount of radi oactivity was found in urine and faeces. It was
speculated that azo cleavage resulting in the formation of aromatic amines is mediated via themicroflora of the rat skin (Aldrich 1986).  La ter on, it was demonstrated experimentally that
various strains of human skin bacteria split a water soluble azo dye (direct blue 14) to thecorresponding amine (o-tolidine) in vitro (Platzek et al. 1999).SCCNFP/0495/01, final

53.4. Metabolism, mutagenicity and carcinogeni city of aromatic amines (arylamines)
The metabolism of arylamines has been studied intensively. Ring oxidation, N-glucuronidation,
N-acetylation, and N-oxidation are the major meta bolic pathways of aryl amines in mammals, the
latter being the crucial step of biotoxification. The enzyme s involved are cytochrom P450
(CYP1A2 and CYP3A4, respectively), yielding  N-hydroxylarylamines which are further
glucuronidated in the liver or acetylated in the bl adder. From these precursors in the acidic pH of
the bladder, nitrenium ions are formed which have been demonstrated to react with the DNAbase guanine. In humans there are toxicologi cally important individual polymorphisms of the
slow N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) and of  the CYP leading to differing individual
susceptibilities with regard to human bladde r carcinogenesis (M arquardt et al. 1999).
The majority of the arylamines is mutagenic, especially in the Salmonella tester strains TA98
and TA100, but metabolic activation with the S9 microsomal preparation mix is required for
activity for most of the compounds. 
Epidemiological studies have provided evidence fo r at least some aromatic amines as being
human carcinogens: benzidine and 2-naphthylamin e were shown to induce urinary bladder
cancers in workers in the azo-dye industry (IARC 1975, 1982).  4-Aminobiphenyl (CAS 92-67-1), benzidine (CAS 92-87-5) a nd 2-naphthylamine (91-59-8) are classified as carcinogens of
category 1 in the EU while 4-chloro-o-toluidine (CAS 95-69-2) is classi fied only in Germany as
category 1 carcinogen (see Table 2).
In the EU, the following amines are cl assified as carcinogens of category 2:
o-Aminoazotoluene (CAS 97-56-3),  4-chloroan iline (CAS 106-47-8),  4,4'-methylenedianiline
(4,4´-diamino-diphenylmethane,  CAS 101-77-9),  3,3´-dichlorobe nzidine (CAS 91-94-1),  3,3´-
dimethoxybenzidine (CAS 119-90-4), 3,3 ´-dimethylbenzidine (CAS 119-93-7), 4,4'-
methylenedi-o-toluidine (3´-dimethyl-4,4 ´-diaminodiphenylmethane,  CAS 838-88-0), 4,4´-
methylene-bis-(2-chloroaniline) (CAS 101-14-4) , o-toluidine (CAS 95-53-4), 4-methyl-m-
phenylenediamine (2,4´-toluylenediamine, CAS 95-80-7), o-anisidine (2-methoxyaniline, CAS90-04-0), 4-aminoazobenzene (CAS 60-09-3) , 4-amino-3-fluorophenol (CAS 399-95-1).
In Germany in addition the following amines are classified as carcinogens of category 2: 
5-nitro-o-toluidine (2-amino- 4-nitrotoluene, CAS 99-55-8), 4-methoxy- m-phenylenediamine
(2,4-diaminoanisole, CA S 615-05-4), 6-methoxy-m-toluidine (p-cresidine, CAS 120-71-8), 4,4´-
oxydianiline (CAS 101-80-4), 4,4´-thiodianilin e (CAS 139-65-1), 2,4,5-trimethylaniline, (CAS
137-17-7), 6-amino-2-ethoxynaphthaline (CAS 293733-21-8). 2,4-xylidine (CAS 95-68-1) and
2,6-xylidine (2,6-dimethylaniline, CAS 87-62-7) are classified as carcinogens of category 3
corresponding to chemical law whereas in the Ge rman List of MAK and BAT Values they are
classified as carcinogens of category 2.
Recently, a draft for the risk assessment repor t of o-anisidine was prepared (CSTEE 2000). With
regard to carcinogenicity the authors concluded that o-anisidine was carcinogenic in rats and
mice. In both species, the main target organ is the urinary bladder. The Scientific Committee onToxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment (CSTEE)  has evaluated the report. In its opinion the
committee agreed with the overall conclusi on of the risk assessment (CSTEE 2001).SCCNFP/0495/01, final

63.5. European regulations
According to the directive 1999/43/EC (17th amendment of directive 76/769/EEC) all benzidine
based azo dyes as well as the azo dyes Dir ect Red 28 (CI 22120, CAS 573-58-0), Direct Blue 6
(CI 22610, CAS 2602-46-2) and Direct Black 38 (CI 30235, CAS 1937-37-7) are classified as
carcinogens of category 2 (EEC 1999). Ac cording to the directive 97/56/EC (16th amendment of
directive 76/769/EEC) Solvent Yellow 1 (CI 11000, 4-aminoazobenzene, CAS 60-09-3) and
Solvent Yellow 3 (CI 11160, CAS 97-56-3) are classi fied as carcinogenic of category 2 (EEC
1997). Direct Brown 95 (CI 30145, CAS 16071-86-6) was classified carcinogenic of category 2
by the directive 94/60/EC (14th amendment of direc tive 76/769/EEC (EEC 1994)).
It was proposed to amend the directive 76/769/EEC with restrictions on certain azo-colorants :
Azo-dyes that may release, by reductive cleavage of one or more azo groups, one or more of the
aromatic amines listed in Appendix, in conc entrations above 30 ppm in the finished articles,
according to the testing method specified in Appe ndix, may not be used in textile and leather
articles which have the potential of coming into  direct and prolonged contact with the human
skin or oral cavity. (EEC 2000). The respective amines are listed in Table 2, Nos 1-21.SCCNFP/0495/01, final

%, 1-[2-(phenylazo) phe nylazo]-2-naphthalenol /g163 2 %.
Evaluation
CI 26100 was tested for mutagenicity in the Am es test. 3 out of 5 commercial samples were
mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 in the presence of S9 mix, the
purified dye, however, was not mutagenic. The mu tagenic activity was assigned by the authors to
the contamination with 4-aminoaz obenzene (starting material of th e synthesis) (Miyagoshi et al.
1985). But no conclusion should be drawn from the negative test result since the metabolic
activation conditions are not ad equate (no Prival protocol).
The clastogenic potential of CI 26100 was investigated in vitro using CHO cells without
metabolic activation. A lthough no metabolic activation system  was added to the culture the
number of breaks per metaphase was increased  following addition of CI 26100 (Au and Hsu
1979).
The carcinogenic potential of CI 26100 was inves tigated following oral administration via food
as a 1 % oil solution at the rate of 2 mg/animal/day to 83 male and 54 female mice. The authorsdid not consider the number of lung tumours to be  significantly greater than in controls, due to
the heterogeneous background of the mice. Groups of  each 5 male and fema le Wistar rats were
fed a diet containig 40,000 mg Sudan III per kg  of diet for 18 months. No tumours were
observed but no individual data on survival were  given. No tumours were observed in 2 groups
of 10 female mice given repeated s.c. injecti ons of 0.25 ml of a saturated solution of CI 26100 in
lard or about 5 mg of crystals injected s ubcutaneously. The working group of IARC considered
these experiments as inadequate (IARC 1975). In  2 experiments using y oung adult female Long-
Evans rats, CI 26100 was tested for possible carci nogenicity. In the first experimental set 0.5 ml
of a 0.5 % (wt/vol) solution in sesame oil was inject ed in thigh muscle of both legs of 8 rats, age
27 days. At necropsy on day 276 no tumours were present. In the second experiment a group of16 female rats was fed by ga stric instillation 1 ml of a 0.1 % (wt/vol) 5 times a week for 25
weeks. At necropsy there were no tumours found (Huggins et al. 1978). Skin painting studies in
100 (50 male/50 female) Swiss We bster mice were carried out by administering 0.1 ml of a 1 %
suspension of CI 26100 in an 1 % aqueous solution of sodium lauryl sulfate to the depilated skin(area 6 cm
2) once weekly for 18 months. No significan t differences in body weight changes and
survival as well as tumour incidences compar ed to the control group were found (Carson 1984).
 
It is worth mentioning that CI 26100 is a stro ng inducer of phase I and II drug metabolizing
enzymes (mainly CYP1A and GST) which was show n to underly the protective effect against
genotoxicity of 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene (Ito  et al. 1982, Ito et al. 1984, Hatakeyama et al.

Purity, composition and substance codes
There is no data available. Generally, azo dyes are known to be contaminated with the
corresponding starting materials of their synthe sis, in this case 4-aminoazobenzene and 7-
hydroxy-1,3-naphthalinesulfonic acid may be present.
Function and uses
CI 27290 is used in hair dyes (Blue List 2000).  CI 27290 is listed in Annex IV Part 1 of the
cosmetics directive 76/768/EEC, with the following field of application: Column 4: Colouring
agents allowed exclusively in cosmetic products intended to come into contact only briefly with
the skin. In a footnote it is mentioned that the insoluble barium, stron tium and zirconium lakes,
salts and pigments of this colouring agent shall also be permitted. They must pass the test forinsolubility which will be determined by the procedure laid down in Article 8. No otherlimitations and requirements are indicated.
Evaluation
CI 27290 may release, by reductive cleavage of  one or more azo groups, 4-aminoazobenzene
which is classified as carcinogen of category 2 in the EU.SCCNFP/0495/01, final

173.7. Conclusion
The azo dyes CI 12150, CI 20170, CI 26100, and CI 27290 are expected to be cleaved into the
carcinogenic amines o-anisidine (CI 1 2150), 2,4- and 2,6-xylidine (CI 20170), and 4-
aminoazobenzene (CI 26100 and CI 27290). Following application onto the skin this might take
place on the surface of the skin mediated by skin bacteria, during percutaneous absorption withinthe skin, and systemically in the liver but there is  no data available. Furthermore, there is no data
available on the amount of percutaneous absorp tion of the mentioned dyes. The published data
on genotoxicity is incomplete and does not rule out a genotoxic potential of the dyes.
Carcinogenicity was investigated only with CI  26100 but the studies were inadequate. Purity
criteria exist only for CI 26100 (Annex IV of the co smetics directive). Generally, azo dyes are
known to be contaminated with the respective starting materials, in the case of CI 1250, CI
20170 and CI 27290 o-anisidine, 2,4- and 2,6-xylidin e, and 4-aminoazobenzene may be present,
respectively, which are known carcinogens (see Ta ble 2). Considering the scarce data on purity,
toxicology and exposure no risk assessment can be  performed for the mentioned dyes. But, from
the available literature on the chemical class of azo dyes it can be deduced that all azo dyeswhich are split into carcinogenic arylamines are possible carcinogens.
3.8. Opinion
The SCCNFP is of the opinion that based on the av ailable information the use of the colorants CI
12150, CI 20170, CI 27290, CI 26100 and of other azo dyes which may release one or morecarcinogenic aromatic amines, poses a ri sk to the health of the consumer.
