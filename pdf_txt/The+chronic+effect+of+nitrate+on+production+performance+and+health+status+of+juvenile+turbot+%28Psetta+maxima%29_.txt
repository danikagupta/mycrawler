 General introduction  
 
The need for aquaculture to supply t he still growing global demand for fish is undisputed . Aquaculture 
takes place in several production systems, including net/pen systems, pond aquaculture, raceway 
systems and recirculat ing aquacultu re systems (RAS). The major difference between  RAS and other 
production systems  is the isolation of the culture water from the surface water.  By recirculating and 
treating the culture water, water can be re -used several times, depending on the quality and  intensity of 
water purification. Due to this isolation of the culture water from the surface water , RAS offer several 
important benefits  such as: better control over a -biotic parameters , reduced water consumption, 
concentration and separation of waste str eams and  better disease control (Martins et al., 2010) . As a 
result of costs for the treatment of incoming water, such as temperature control , disinfection  and costs 
for waste water discharge there is a trend to reduce water consumption (Blancheton et al.,  2007). A 
reduced water consumption by an equal feed load leads to an in tensification of water utilization.  
Consequently  several substances, originating (in) -directly from the  feed, accumulate  in the culture 
water.  Several studies for both marine and fresh  water fish species have shown that intensification of 
water use,  could negatively affect  fish performance (Davidson et al., 2009, 2011, Deviller et al., 2005, 
Matins et al., 2009, 2011).  Due to the experimental design used in these studies, different wate r 
exchange  rates by equal feed loads , observed  effects are multi -causative.  It is s uggest ed that these 
effects are caused by accumulating substances, e.g.  nitrate (Davidson et al., 2011, Martins et al., 
2009), ortho -phosphate (Martins et al., 2009) or meta ls (Davidson et al., 2009,  Deviller et al., 2005, 
Martins et al., 2011) . Monofactorial studies on the effects of accumulating substances, especially for 
marine fish species are lacking.  Consequently such substances are not treated  by specific technologies  
in RAS. Standard water treatment in marine RAS consist s of mechanical filtration (e.g. drum -filtration 
and foam fractionating) and nitrification process (e.g. biological nitrification and ozonation). However 
by increased intensification of marine RAS other  water treatment processes,  accumulation of 
additional  substances might become relevant. Thus b y knowing the fish tolerant  limits  for nitrate, 
phosphate and metals new water treatment techniques should be focused . 
Electrochemical water treatment using grap hite and metal el ectrodes to remove accumulating 
substances and to disinfect aquaculture water has been studied in the past (Jorquera et al., 2002, Lin 
and Wu, 1996).  Recent developments in waste and ballast water treatment have made electrochemical 
water treatment with artificial diamond electrodes commercial ly available.  Artificial diamonds can be 
produced with a technique called chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Using this technique diamond can 
be deposited on non -diamond surfaces , but moreover impurities  such as Boron can be controlled 
incorporated in the crystalline diamond structure. Boron Doped Diamond (BDD) electrodes are 
conductive carrier materials whereon a thin film of carbon and boron, in 100:1 ratio, is deposited. As a 
result of the boron incorp oration this new material is semi -conductive but still has the unique 
properties of diamond, such as hardness, thermal conductivity and chemical inertness (Tribidasari et 2 
 al. 2005). Furthermore the surface of a BDD electrode is hydrophobic, and therefore w hen water is 
electrolyzed with BDD electrodes, the rate of water electrolysis is negligible  and the rate of oxidant 
production is maximal . Thus instead of the evolution of H 2 and O 2 as in normal electrolysis,  hydroxyl 
radicals (HO●) and hydrogen (H+) are formed according to the formula:  
 
H2O  OH● + H+ + e- 
  
Due to the high oxidation potential of hydroxyl radicals, waste water treatment with BDD electrodes is 
studied intensively. Since early 1990 the use of BDD -electrodes for waste water treatme nt was stud ied 
and first results showed potential for electrochemical cathodic nitrate reduction (Tenne et al., 1993) 
anodic organic pollutant oxidation (Carey, 1995) , phosphorus removal (Feng et al., 2003)  and trace 
metal removal (Comnellis et al., 2005) . However BDD electrodes nowadays are mostly applied  to 
degrade non -biodegradable substances such as aromatic compounds, dyes, pharmaceutical 
compounds, and pesticides  into biodegradable fractions, which can then be treated using common 
biological methods ( Wang & Xu, 2012) . Another field of application of  BDD electrodes is the 
treatment of  ballast water  in order to produce disinfectants in the water itself without the need for 
external chemicals or processes (Echardt & Kornmueller, 2009) . Due to these both applications  in 
other fields, (in) -organic removal and disinfection BDD -electrolysis might be a suitable water 
treatment technique for RAS aquaculture but u ntil now, a pplication of BDD electrodes for aquaculture 
purposes is limited to only one laboratory study (Diaz e t al., 2012).  In this study BDD electrodes were 
tested as alternative to biofiltration, in order to reduce total ammonia nitrogen, nitrite and chemical 
oxygen demand  in marine aquaculture water. However results were obtained in a lab oratory 
environment wit h a volume of ca. 1 liter, clean electrodes and without fish  stocks . But more important 
effects on other accumulating substances, long term effects, interaction with fish and the biofiltration 
process and practical  handling  couldn’t be assessed.    
 
Theref ore in this thesis two main research topics were targeted. First the effect of the accumulation of 
in-organics on health and production performance of fish was studied. Therefore i n the  first part of the  
present thesis the maximal allowable water quality c oncentrations for the major pollutants nitrate  
(chapter 1) , ortho phosphate  (chapter 2)  and the trace mineral s iron ( Fe), zinc (Zn), copper ( Cu), cobalt  
(Co) and manganese  (Mn) (chapter 3) for the culture of marine fish  were determined.  In these three 
chapt ers the turbot ( Psetta maxima ) was used as model species.  By knowing these limits minimal 
water exchange rates can be calculated and bottlenecks in water treatment can be found .  
Secondly the use BDD -electrodes to impr ove water quality in RAS was  explored , by the use of 
replicated small scaled RAS . In chapte r 4, commercial  farming in marine RAS was simulated, using 
white leg shrimp ( Litopenaeus vannamei ) as model species  because susceptibility  of turbot and shrimp 
to disinfection by -products is comparable ( Reiser et al., 2010, Schroeder et al., 2010). Effects  of 3 
 additional water treatment with ozonation or BDD electrolysation on water quality, disinfection and 
shrimp performance were  studied . In chapter 5  the previous experiment was scaled up to a commercial  
scaled RAS  size culturing turbot ( Psetta maxima ) and  effects of  additional ozonation or additional 
BDD electrolysation  on water quality , disinfection and practical handling of  the electrocell  was 
studied. Finally in chapter 6 the possibilities for the use  of BDD electrodes in fresh water RAS w as 
evaluated . Fresh water has a different ionic water matrix and therefore other effects of BDD treatment 
on water quality can be expected. Here the European eel ( Anguilla anguilla ) was used as model 
species and again  effects on water quality, dis infection, fish health and practical handling were 
evaluated.  
Thus by knowing the tolerable water quality limits for marine fish and opportunities for BDD 
electrolysation in RAS new water treatment strategies can be determine d.

 Abstract  
 
The chronic effect of nitrate on the production performance and health of marine cultured fish species 
is still unknown. Thus, the aim of the present research was to evaluate the chronic effect of nitrate on 
production parameters and health status of turbot ( Psetta maxima ). Juvenile turbot were exposed to 0 
mg/l NO 3-N (control C), 125 mg/l NO 3-N (low nitrate LN), 250 mg/l NO 3-N (medium nitrate MN) and 
500 mg/l NO 3-N (high nitrate HN) for 6 weeks in small -scaled recirculating aquaculture systems 
(RAS). After 42 d, biomass yiel d, length, weight and specific growth rate (SGR) were significantly 
(p<0.05) lower for LN, MN and HN compared to C. Mortality, food conversion ratio (FCR), condition 
factor (CF) and splenic index (SI) did not differ significantly (p>0.05) between C and LN but were 
significantly (p<0.05) higher in the MN and HN groups. Hepatosomatic index (HSI), total hemoglobin 
(Hb) and methemoglobin (MetHb) did not show significant differences (p>0.05) between treatments. 
Thus, nitrate negatively influences the p roduction performance of turbot  even at low concentrations , 
and nitrate management is therefore a key -factor in turbot RAS production.

 1. Introduction  
 
Over the last decades, fish production in land based recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) has 
become increas ingly important in the aquaculture industry. Due to high levels of water re -use, water 
renewal is less than 5 % per day in modern RAS. As a result, waste is accumulating in these systems 
making water treatment and waste management key factors in RAS techno logy. The principle 
excretory metabolite of fish is ammonia, which is highly toxic and, therefore, needs to be eliminated 
from the water. Biological nitrification has been established in RAS as the most common method for 
the removal of ammonia, involving a  two-step oxidation of ammonia to nitrite and finally to nitrate by 
aerobic chemoautotrophic bacteria (Eding et al., 2006). As a consequence, nitrate accumulates to high 
levels in modern RAS with low water exchange and high hydraulic retention  times. Conce ntrations of 
100-1000 mg/l NO 3-N are not uncommon and nitrate management becomes increasingly important 
(van Rijn, 2010). Nitrate can be removed from the rearing water by denitrification or, less desirable in 
terms of sustainable production, by water excha nge. To manage and optimize these processes, 
maximal allowable concentrations of nitrate in RAS have to be determined.  
Acute and chronic effects of nitrate have been reported in several fresh water fish species (Camargo et 
al., 2005; Kamstra and van der He ul, 1998; Hamlin, 2006) and marine invertebrates (Hirayama, 1974; 
Camargo et al., 2005; Romano and Zeng 2007; Kuhn et al. 2010). In contrast, data on nitrate toxicity 
in marine fish are limited. Acute nitrate toxicity has only been studied in 8 marine spec ies (Brownell, 
1980; Pierce et al., 1993) and 2 anadromous species reared in saline water (Westin, 1974) revealing 
LC-50 concentrations between 573 and 5050 mg/l NO 3-N. Although these values are in fact very high, 
one has to consider that nitrate is usuall y added as sodium nitrate (NaNO 3) in these experiments. 
Hence, addition of sodium -nitrate in high quantities results in extreme salinities, which are more likely 
to cause mortality than the nitrate itself (Brownell, 1980). Furthermore, addition of sodium n itrate 
causes a Na+/K+ imbalance in water, which contributes to adverse effects and thereby underestimates 
the nitrate tolerance of marine animals (Romano and Zeng 2007; 2009). Chronic toxicity has only 
been studied in one juvenile tropical marine species.  In this study 100 mg/l NO 3-N affected color and 
growth of Amphiprion occelaris  compared to a control group reared at 16 mg/l NO 3-N (Frankes and 
Hoff, 198 2).  
The mechanisms of nitrate toxicity to aquatic animals are due mainly to methemoglobinemia, caused  
by the oxidation of hemoglobin (Hb) to methemoglobin (MetHb) in blood (Camargo et al., 2005). In 
fish the pathways of nitrate uptake are not clear. Nitrate is taken up via the branchial system, but due 
to the low permeability of the gills to nitrate, upta ke is limited and other mechanisms are suggested 
(Stormer et al., 1996).  Another possible pathway might be trans -dermal uptake of nitrate in the gastro 
intestinal tract, as was reported for nitrite in European flounder ( Platichthys flesus ) (Grosell and 
Jensen, 2000). Nevertheless, so far this has not been examined for nitrate uptake in fish . Because the 
exact pathways of nitrate uptake are not known, the relation between salinity of the water and nitrate 8 
 uptake is unclear. Although several studies showed t hat nitrate toxicity decreases with increasing salt 
concentrations, no causal explanation has been found yet (Tsai and Cheng, 2002; Romano and Zeng, 
2007; 2009; Kuhn et al., 2010).  
Due to the lack of experimental studies on chronic effects of nitrate on ma rine fish species, literature 
safety levels are theoretical values calculated from acute toxicity data (LC -50 values) or based on 
experience in routine aquaculture. As a consequence, safety levels in the literature vary between 20 
mg/l NO 3-N (Spotte, 1970)  and 500 mg/l NO 3-N (Pierce et al., 1993; Timmons and Ebeling, 2010), or 
nitrate is considered to be not significantly toxic (Russo and Thurston, 1991). Data on the chronic 
impact of realistic nitrate levels, which are actually met in RAS, on production pe rformance and health 
of marine cultured fish species are lacking. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the 
impact of nitrate concentrations commonly observed in RAS on mortality, growth performance, feed 
utilization and health status of juven ile turbot ( Psetta maxima ). 
 
2. Material & Methods  
 
2.1 Experimental setup  
 
Juvenile turbot were obtained from Maximus A/S (Bedsted Thy, Denmark) and acclimatized to 
culturing systems at the facilities of the GMA (Büsum, Germany) for one week prior to the six week 
experimental exposure. A total of 168 turbot with a mean average weight (±SD) of 18.6 ±1.1g  (range: 
17.0-21.0 g) were randomly distributed to twelve separate RAS, which provided a control at 0 mg/l 
NO 3-N (control C) and three treatments at  125 mg/l NO 3-N (low nitrate LN), 250 mg/l NO 3-N 
(medium nitrate MN) and 500 mg/l NO 3-N (high nitrate HN) , with three replicates each .  Average 
weight per system was 261.0 ± 0.4 g resulting in an initial density of 373 g/m². Each RAS (total 
volume of 300 l) consist ed of a rectangular rearing tank (275 l, 0.7 m² footprint), a moving bed 
biofilter (Kunstoff -Spranger, Plauen, Germany) and a protein skimmer (Model 1 AH 1100, Erwin 
Sander, Uetze -Eltze, Germany) using compressed air. Flow rate through the moving bed biofi lter was 
700 l/h, flow rate through the protein -skimmer was 800 l/h, making a total flow rate of 1 500 l/h, equal 
to 5 tank volumes per hour. Temperature was automatically adjusted to 19°C with a temperature -
controlled 500 W heater (Aqua Medic, Bissendorf, Germany). A photoperiod of 14 hours light (06:00 -
20:00), 10 hours dark was provided.  Fish were fed ad libitum  twice a day, 6 days per week with a 
commercial turbot feed (Aller 488 BM, Aller Aqua, Christiansfeld, Denmark). Uneaten pellets were 
netted out an d counted one hour after feeding .  
Prior to the exposure, RAS were filled with UV disinfected seawater (22 ppt salinity) and nominal 
concentrations of 125, 250 and 500 mg/l NO 3-N were obtained by the addition of NaNO 3 and KCl  
solution, providing a Na+/K+ weight -ratio of 1:46 to avoid imbalances of the cellular homeostasis. 
Weekly, fresh water was added in equal amounts to all RAS to compensate evaporation losses. Every 9 
 second week, 200 l water per RAS were exchanged to minimize accumulation of metabolic NO 3-N. 
During exposure, water parameters were kept in the optimum range for turbot, summarized in table 1.

2.2 Water quality analysis  
 
Temperature, total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), NO 2-N, NO 3-N, pH, salinity, flow rate and dissolved 
oxygen (DO) wer e measured twice a week. TAN, NO 2-N and NO 3-N were determined 
spectrophotometrically using a HACH -DR 2800 spectrophotometer (Hach -Lange GmbH, Berlin, 
Germany) and powder pillow detection kits based on the ammonia salicylate method, diazotization 
method and  the cadmium reduction method, respectively (Hach -Lange GmbH, Berlin, Germany). 
Temperature and pH were measured with a WTW 340i portable multiparameter instrument (WTW 
GmbH, Weilheim, Germany). Salinity was determined with a digital refractometer  HI 96822  
(HANNA Instruments, Woonsocket, USA) , dissolved oxygen with a Handy Polaris oxygen probe 
(Oxygard International A/S, Birkenrød, Denmark).  
 
2.3 Sampling  
 
During the experimental period feed intake and mortality were recorded daily, group weight weekly. 
After six weeks of exposure group weight as well as individual length and wet weight of fish were 
determined. Weight was recorded to the nearest 0.1 g, length was recorded to the nearest mm. Upon 
sampling three fish per tank were killed, liver and spleen we re removed and weighed to the nearest 
0.001 g. Blood samples were drawn from the caudal vein. For methemoglobin (MetHb) analysis a 
subsample was immediately frozen on dry -ice and stored at -80° C. For total hemoglobin  (total -Hb) a 
subsample was cooled on c rushed ice and analyzed within 3 hours after sampling.  
 
 
 10 
 2.4 Analysis of blood parameters (total Hb, MetHb)  
 
Total -Hb was determined by the cyanmethemoglobin method using a Hemoglobin FS reagent kit 
(DiaSys, International, Holzheim, Germany) in the whole blood within 3 h after sampling. All samples 
were measured in duplicates with a microplate reader Infinite 200 (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland) at 
540 nm and calculated from a standard hemoglobin dilution series (HEM QS, Diaglobal GmbH, 
Germany)  using 5µl b lood and 1 ml reagent.  
Methemoglobin was determined as the ratio of MetHb to total -Hb using the cyan ferrocyancomplex 
method (Hegesh et al., 1970). In brief, h emolysis of 20 µl sample was carried out in 1 ml MilliQ 
(hypotonic media) for 15 min at room tem perature, followed by the addition of 600 µl saponin 
solution (1% in phosphate buffer [9 g Na 2HPO 4 * 12 H 2O, 5.7 g KH 2PO 4, pH 6.6 to 1 L MilliQ]), 
vortexing and centrifugation (10 min, 3000 g) to separate cell debris. From the supernatant, the ratio of 
MetHb to total Hb was determined in duplicates at 633 nm, measuring the absorption in: 250 µl 
supernatant (A1), followed by the addition of 5 µl 1% KCN and incubation for 10 min (A2) and in 250 
µl supernatant after addition of 5 µl K 4[Fe(CN) 6] (A3), followed by an addition of  5 µl 1% KCN and 
incubation for 10 min (A4). Total Hb:MetHb was calculated  as (A1 -A2)/(A3 -A4). 
 
2.5 Data analysis  
 
Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) of n samples. Statistical analysis was performed 
using SPSS 17.0 (IBM inc, Armonk, USA). Data were tested for normality and for equal variances 
(p<0.05) using Levene’s test and the Kolgomorov -Smirnov test, respectively. Multiple comparisons 
were carried out by the parametric Tukey’s HSD or the non -parametric Dunnet’s T3 test .  Differences 
were considered significant at p<0.05.  
 
3. Results  
 
All water quality parameters measured (table 2) (with the exception of nitrate) were in the optimum 
range for turbot (table 1) at all sampling times. Average nitrate levels for LN, MN and HN were 
comparable to the nominal concentrations, deviating within 2 % of the nominal value (tab. 2). Average 
pH and nitrite nitrogen levels differed significantly between treatments, ranging from 7.82 to 7.97 and 
0.07 to 0.27 mg/l, respectively (table 2).  Temperature, dissolved oxygen, salinity and total ammonia 
nitrogen did not significantly differ between treatments.

(ANOVA with Tukey HSD or Dunnet ’s T3 post hoc test, p<0.05, n= 36).  
 
 
Mortality in the control group was zero, but increased with increasing nitrate concentration to 9.5 % in 
MN and HN, both revealed significantly (n=3, Tukey, p<0.05) higher values. At the end of the 
exposure, mortality rates we re 0, 2.4 ± 4.1, 9.5 ± 4.1 and 9.5 ± 10.9% in the C, LN, MN and HN 
treatments, respectively.  
After 42 d, final length and weight decreased with increasing nitrate concentration and were 
significantly different (C: n=42; LN: n=41; MN: n=38; HN: n=38, Tukey , p<0.05) between all groups 
(table 3). Condition factor (CF) decreased with increasing nitrate concentration. Mean CF of C, LN, 
MN and HN was 1.85 ± 0.11, 1.83 ± 0.11, 1.77 ± 0.12 and 1.62 ± 0.22, respectively, revealing 
significant differences (C: n=42; LN: n=41; MN: n=38; HN: n=38, Dunett T3, p<0.05) in MN and HN 
compared to C. Biomass yield as a result of increased mortality and decreased growth, was 
significantly different between all groups (n=3, Tukey, p<0.05) and decreased with increasing nitrate 
concentration. Mean biomass yield was 512.9 ± 16.8, 450.5 ± 2.9, 363.0 ± 10.3 and 286.0 ± 20.9 g in 
C, LN, MN and HN, respectively.  
Over the 42 day experimental period, specific growth rates (SGR) were significantly different (n=3, 
Tukey, p<0.05) between all  treatments and negatively correlated with nitrate concentrations. 
Individual growth rates were linear related with nitrate concentration according to the formula:  
  
SGR = SGR control - 0.0025(NO 3-N)     (figure 1).

Total feed intake (TFI) was negatively correlated with nitrate concentrations. Significant differences 
(p<0.05) in feed intake were notated in all t reatment groups (LN: 219.9 ± 5.3 g, MN: 185.5 ± 29.6 g,  
and HN: 164.2 ± 25.4 g) compared to C at 267.8 ± 21.3 g. Daily feed intake (DFI) based on the actual 
number of feeding days was significantly lower in  LN, MN and HN compared to control.  
FCR increase d with nitrate concentration, revealing 1.07 ± 0.11, 1.11 ± 0.04, 1.43 ± 0.16, 3.8 ± 0.94 in 
the C, LN, MN and HN groups, respectively.  
HSI did not differ significantly (n=9, Tukey, p>0.05) between treatments. In contrast SI increased with 
increasing nitra te concentration. SI of the control was significantly lower (n=9, Dunett T3, p<0.05) 
compared to the SI of MN and HN groups. SI values ranged from 0.053 ± 0.013 (C), 0.059 ± 0.019

Total -Hb was comparable betw een treatments, ranging from 3.9 ± 0.5 (HN) to 4.6 ± 0.6 (LN). Equally, 
the percentage of Met -Hb did not vary significantly between treatments.  Both, total -Hb as well as 
MetHb revealed high individual variability as indicated by a high standard deviation.

 4. Discussion  
  
Throughout the experiment all relevant water quality parameters, with the exception of nitrate, were in 
the optimum range for maximal growth performance, including temperature, oxygen, total ammonia 
nitrogen and salinity. Nitrite and pH were correlated to the nitrate concentrations and were 
significantly different between treatments. Still, both parameters were within the optimum range for 
maximum growth performance of turbot. In particular nitrite was <  0.3 mg/l NO 2-N in average and 
maximum nitrite concentration over the entire experimental period was 0.56 mg/l NO 2-N. Since lowest 
observed effect concentration (LOEC) of nitrite in Brazilian flounder ( Paralichthys orbignyanus) has 
been reported 3 mg/l (Bianchini et al., 1996) and acute toxic levels in turbot are 67 mg/l NO 2-N 
(Boeuf et al., 1999), nitrite is considered well below concentrations accounting for effects as the ones 
reported here. Differences in growth performance and production as well as hea lth parameters between 
treatments are, therefore, thought to be monofactorial, resulting from nitrate concentrations during 
exposure. The nitrate concentrations were achieved by addition of NaNO 3, meeting nominal 
concentrations of 125, 250 and 500 mg/l with deviations < 2%.  In RAS, nitrate concentrations 
accumulate as a consequence of the nitrification process and concentrations of  100-1,000 mg/l NO 3-N 
have frequently been reported (van Rijn, 2010).  Romano and Zeng (2007; 2009) reported higher 
susceptibili ty to nitrate in shrimp when nitrate was purely added as NaNO 3, probably due to ionic 
imbalances if Na+ increased substantially compared to K+. As a consequence KCl was added to assure 
a Na:K mole ratio of 46:1, modified to the protocol of Romano and Zeng (2009).  
Overall growth performance of the control groups during the experimental period was low with a SGR 
ranging between 1.54 and 1.69 for the replicates. In previous studies SGR reported in turbot of 
comparable size was generally between 2.0 and 3.5 (Ar nason et al., 2009; Imsland et al., 2002; Irwin 
et al., 1999). During the study presented here, fish were fed twice a day for 6 days and group weighing 
was carried out at day 7. The 6 days feeding regime and the handling -related stress might thus explain 
lower SGR values. Still, here, FCR of the control group varied between 0.99 and 1.19 and is 
comparable with previously reported values in turbot (Arnason et al., 2009; Foss et al., 2009; Imsland 
et al., 2002). Thus, acceptable growth rate of the control wit h regard to the feeding regime,  a normal 
FCR and the fact that fish biomass almost doubled during the experimental period of 42 days reveals 
good rearing conditions, representative for turbot production and, therefore, allows evaluation of 
nitrate exposur e on growth performance and health.  
In the present study, health status of turbot was roughly assessed as mortality, HSI, SI, total -Hb and 
Met-Hb. Mortality was positively correlated with nitrate concentrations, with zero mortality in the 
control group, i ncreasing to 9.5% in MN and HN and is the most crucial indicator of nitrate impact on 
the health of turbot. In Pacific white shrimp ( Litopenaeus vannamei ), nitrate concentrations of > 220 
mg/l NO 3-N resulted in increased mortality (Kuhn et al., 2010). In c ontrast, Kamstra et al. (1998) 
reported a decrease in mortality of eel ( Anguilla anguilla ) at high nitrate levels  and suggested that fish 15 
 are inactive and therefore less aggressive at high nitrate levels. In anemone fish (Amphiprion 
occelaris ) Frankes and  Hoff (1982) reported zero mortality in both control and 100 mg/l NO 3-N 
treatment. The hepatosomatic index (HSI) indicates the nutritional state, commonly increasing with 
improving nutritional state (Arfsten et al., 2010). Still, increased HSI may also be observed if 
inadequate feeding results in fat accumulation in the liver (Tusche et al., 2011) and has to be evaluated 
carefully. Here, HSI fluctuated between 1.4 and 1.7, which is comparable to HSI frequently reported 
in healthy, well -nourished turbot (Fou rnier et al., 2002; Abele et al., 2007; Peres and Oliva -Teles, 
2008). Splenic index (SI) showed a positive correlation with nitrate concentration, increasing from 
0.053 in the control to 0.059, 0.094 and 0.101 in the LN, MN and HN group, respectively. Sinc e 0.05 
is considered a normal SI for farmed turbot (Quentel and Obach, 1992) a twofold increase might be 
considered pathological. Furthermore, as the spleen is the principal organ of blood cell storage and 
production in fish, increased SI is indicative of respiro -circulatory impact such as 
methemoglobinemia. Here, MetHb was comparable between treatments and thus did not indicate 
impeded respiro -circulatory function. Nevertheless, increased SI can be an indication of diseases or 
immunological problems (Goede  and Barton, 1990) or the impact of toxicants (Hutchinson and 
Manning, 1996). Although mortalities and SI suggest a severe health impact during nitrate exposure, 
total-Hb does not confirm a respiro -circulatory dysfunction as values are within a comparable range as 
previously reported by Person le Ruyet et al. (2002), Pichavant et al. (2003) and Waring et al. (1996) . 
Nitrate is known to transform Hb into MetHb in aquatic animals (Camargo et al., 2005), consequently 
reducing oxygen binding capacity and ultima tely resulting in respiro -circulatory constrains . In fish a 
MetHb reductase system compensates for MetHb formation by conversion of MetHb to Hb (Freeman 
et al., 1983). This acclimatization is an energy consuming activity (Urrutia and Tomasso, 1987). 
Conseq uently, conversion of MetHb into Hb may not just explain constant MetHb values observed 
here but also provide an explanation for reduced growth observed here, as already suggested by Colt 
and Armstrong (1981).  Values for metHb formation in marine fish are  scarce and highly species -
specific. In Chinook salmon  (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha ) and sea bass ( Dicentrarchus labrax  ) 
MetHb was not detectable below a species -specific nitrite threshold  (Crawford and Allen, 1977; 
Scarano et al., 1984). Still, European fl ounder ( Platichthys flesus ) exhibited 4 -6% (Grosell and Jensen, 
2000) and Atlantic cod ( Gadus morhua ) 27% MetHb (Graham and Fletcher, 1986) in unexposed fish.   
Here, MetHb was between 17.6 and 19.6 %, which is considered basal value in turbot with regard t o 
the control fish assessed.  
All growth parameters (SGR, final weight, final length, biomass yield) are negatively linearly 
correlated with nitrate concentration and all these parameters showed significant differences between 
control and nitrate treatment s. These results are in line with results from Frankes and Hoff (1982) who 
reported reduced growth and color in anemone fish at 100 mg/l NO 3-N compared to a control group 
raised at 16 mg/l NO 3-N, and Kamstra et al. (1998) who observed growth depression in eel at 250 mg/l 
NO 3-N compared to control group at 50 mg/l NO 3-N. Here, reduced growth performance can be 16 
 explained by energetic costs to maintain homeostasis, in particular with regard to the potential 
conversion of MetHb by the nitrite reductase as discu ssed above. The increased energy demand is 
thereby not compensated by increased food intake. This resulted in a reduced CF in the nitrate exposed 
groups, which is another indicator for the increased energy demand due to nitrate exposure.  
Furthermore, feed  utilization was less efficient in terms of feed conversion ratio (FCR) at increasing 
nitrate concentrations. Again, this suggests an energy mobilization for detoxification, which is 
consequently not available for body growth. Reduced growth performance du e to nitrate exposition is 
therefore a factor that impairs production in RAS -based turbot aquaculture.   
 
5. Conclusions  
 
Nitrate negatively influences growth and health status of turbot, even at concentrations far below most 
safety levels suggested in lit erature. In the present experiment significant negative impact of nitrate on 
growth performance were observed at ≥125 mg/l NO 3-N, and on health and feed efficiency at ≥ 250 
mg/l NO 3-N. Thus, in view of an economic turbot production nitrate management in RA S-based 
aquaculture needs to be optimized between taking into account increased production costs as a 
consequence of lower growth, less efficient feed utilization and higher mortality, and the actual costs 
for nitrate removal or water exchange.

 Abstract  
 
In intensive recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) ortho -phosphat e (ortho -P) is one of the main 
accumulating substances, but effects of chronically elevated concentrations on fish health and 
production performance are still unknown. Therefore 120 juvenile turbot ( Psetta maxima ) were 
exposed to ortho -P concentrations of 3 mg/L (control - C), 26 mg/L (low - LP), 52 mg/L (medium - 
MP) and 82 mg/L (high - HP) for 56 days and fed until satiation with a commercial diet. Health status 
and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were not significantly affected by treatment (p>0.05).  Specif ic 
growth rates (SGR) and daily feed intake (DFI) of C were not considered significantly different from 
LP, MP and HP treatments, however LP showed significant higher DFI and SGR than HP (p<0.05). 
Using non -linear regression between SGR and ortho -P concent rations, 27 mg/L ortho -P was found as 
the optimum for turbot growth. Although not reflected in blood plasma P levels (p>0.05) a potential 
aqueous P uptake might result in metabolic benefits leading to the observed growth enhancement in 
the LP treatment.  
In a second experiment 114 juvenile turbot were exposed to ortho -P concentrations of 2 mg/L (C2) 
and 25 mg/L (LP2) for 63 days and fed until satiation with a low P diet (4.6 g digestible -P / kg diet). 
Overall production performance was low due to low volunta ry feed intake. Whereas the FCR was 
unaffected by treatment (p>0.05), significantly higher feed intake and biomass gain were observed for 
LP2 compared to C2 (p<0.05). LP2 treatment showed a trend for higher protein retention efficiency 
and lower whole body  lipid content (p<0.1). The dry matter, ash, Phosphorus, Calcium and protein 
content in whole body did not significantly vary between treatments (p>0.05).   
In conclusion the accumulation of ortho -P in RAS does not negatively affect health of turbot. Elevat ed 
ortho -P seems to have slight positive effects on production performance of juvenile turbot. Further 
research to quantify dietary P requirements for turbot in general, as well as for turbot raised under 
elevated ortho -P conditions in RAS is strongly requ ired.

 1. Introduction  
 
In intensive recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) the use of make -up water is tried to minimize in 
order to reduce water consumption and costs for energy due to heating or cooling. As a result ‘inert’ 
substances such as nitrate,  ortho -phosphate and metals originating from make -up water and feed 
accumulate in the culture water (Davidson et al. 2009). Applied feed is the main source of ortho -
phosphate phosphorus (ortho -P) and the fraction of dietary phosphorus (P) that can accumula te is 
dependent on the amount of dietary -P, the retention efficiency of P and leaching of particulate -P from 
faeces.  
In fish the fraction of digested P excreted as ortho -P is dependent on the excess amount of available P 
(Sarker et al., 2009, Coloso et al ., 2003 ) and the fraction of total -P as available -P is mostly 
depending on the amount and source of P (Hua & Bureau 2006 , Pimentel -Rodrigues & Oliva -Teles, 
2006) . The amount of ortho -P that leaches from faeces is dependent on the retention time in the wate r 
and stability of the faeces (Brinker et al., 2005). Therefore accumulation of ortho -P is strongly 
dependent on formulation and physical properties of formulated diets. In commercial aquaculture 
turbot are fed with diets high in total P content, e.g. 14 -16 g total -P/kg diet (Efico sigma 570 Biomar, 
Aller 505 ex Aller aqua) and a high available P content (table 2). Furthermore turbot are mostly 
cultured in shallow tanks causing a relative high stocking density per water volume, resulting in a high 
potential  for ortho -P accumulation when cultured in RAS.  
In intensive RAS  ortho -P concentrations of 25 -45 mg / l are not uncommon (Rishel & Ebeling, 2006, 
Schneider et al., 2006, Tal et al., 2009, Martins et al., 2009a,). In RAS Ortho -P can be reduced by 
water exch ange but this is undesired in terms of water consumption and nutrient discharge. Methods 
that are developed and used in experimental RAS are biological removal, chemical flocculation or 
integrated multitrophic aquaculture (IMTA) (Barak et al, 2003, Rishel & Ebeling, 2006,Metaxa et al., 
2006). However this is not common praxis as limitations in removal efficiency and cost effectiveness 
restrict a commercial application until now (Martins et al., 2010). The use of hydroxyl radicals to 
reduce ortho -P in pond e ffluent water (Feng et al, 2003) or in marine RAS (van Bussel et al., 2012a) 
might be a promising future technique. To determine if in -system treatment is necessary and to 
optimize efficiency of either in -system or end -of-the-pipe treatment maximal allowab le concentrations 
of ortho -P for fish production have to be determined.  
Several authors have reported negative effects of increased water re -use on growth and health of both 
fresh water and marine fish species (Davidson et al 2011, Deviller et al., 2005, G ood et al. 2009, 
Martins et al. 2009b). Ortho -P is suggested as a possible cause, but due to multiple variables in these 
studies there is no causal conclusion possible. Acute toxicity of ortho -P has only been studied for two 
fresh water fish species reveal ing LC -50 values between 28 and 186 mg/l ortho -P (Ufodike & 
Onusiriuka, 1990, Wallen et al., 1957) but chronic toxicity to carp ( Cyprinus carpio ) larvae is much 
higher revealing toxicity effects at concentrations as low as 0.14 mg/l ortho -P (Toor et al., 1 983). For 24 
 marine fish species data are lacking completely, however some data for marine bivalves exist. At 
levels as low as 0.04 mg/l ortho -P affects shell formation (Bernhardt et al., 1985), increased mortality 
in oyster larvae ( Crassostrea gigas ) is obse rved at 0.27 mg/l ortho -P (Kunigelisa & Wilbura, 1987). 
However 5 month exposure of abalone  (Haliotis iris ) to ortho -P concentrations of 0.3 -2 mg/l ortho -P 
resulted in significant lower growth (James & Barr, 2012)  in contrast juvenile oyster ( C. gigas ) 
exposed to levels up to 19 mg/l ortho -P for 96 hours did not show any effect on mortality or feed 
intake ( Epifanio &Srna, 1975).  
In fish ortho -phosphate can be uptake from the water by the gastro -intestinal tract, and the  nephron has 
the capacity for both ne t renal P secretion and net P reabsorption in both marine and fresh water 
species (Hickman and Trump 1969). Although fish are thus able to excrete P, increased water ortho -
phosphate levels leads to hyperphosphatemia (Urasa and Wendelaar Bonga, 1987) that g enerally 
causes hypocalcemia in mammals due to excessive precipitation of calcium phosphate in soft tissues 
which result in organ dysfunction  and eventually in death (Suki et al. 1973).  
Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the chronic effect of ortho -P concentrations, 
common in commercial RAS or possible in future low -discharge RAS, on health and production 
performance of juvenile turbot ( P. maxima ). Results obtained from the toxicity study indicated an 
optimum for feed intake and growth at ar ound 25 mg/l. To reveal these differences turbot were raised 
under control and optimum ortho -P concentration and fed a low -P diet. In addition to health and 
production performance, proximate body composition and nutrient retention was evaluated.  
 
2. Materi al & Methods  
 
2.1 System set up  
 
Each of the 12 experimental RAS (total volume of 300 l) consisted of a rectangular rearing tank (275 l, 
0.7 m² footprint), a moving bed biofilter (30 l, Kunstoff -Spranger, Plauen, Germany) and a protein 
skimmer (Model 1 AH 1100, Erwin Sander, Uetze -Eltze, Germany) using compressed air. Flow rate 
through the moving bed biofilter and protein skimmer was 700 l/h and 800 l/h respectively, resulting 
in a total flow rate of 1500 l/h, equal to 5 tank volumes per hour. Water tempera ture was not adjusted 
and thus dependent on room temperature which was kept constant at 18 ºC. A photoperiod of 14 hours 
light (06:00 -20:00), 10 hours dark was provided . Prior to the exposure, RAS were filled with UV 
disinfected seawater (24 ppt salinity) and nominal concentrations of ortho -P were obtained by the 
addition of Na 2HPO 4 * 2 H 2O and KCl  solution, providing a Na+/K+ weight -ratio of 46:1 to avoid 
imbalances of the cellular homeostasis. Weekly, fresh water was added in equal amounts to all RAS to 
compensate evaporation losses. Every second week, 200 l water per RAS were exchanged to minimize 
accumulation of metabolic NO 3-N and  PO 4-P. During exposure, salinity, pH, temperature, dissolved 25 
 oxygen, total ammonia nitrogen, nitrite and nitrate were kept in the optimum range for turbot, for 
details see van Bussel et al. (2012b).  
 
2.2 Experimental set -up 
 
a) toxicity study  
 
Juvenile turbot were obtained from Maximus A/S (Bedsted Thy, Denmark) and acclimatized to 
culturing systems at the facilities of the G MA (Büsum, Germany) for one week. A total of 120 turbot 
with an average wet weight (±SD) of 32 ± 3 g (range: 30 -40 g) were randomly distributed to twelve 
separate RAS, providing a control at 0 mg/l ortho -P (control C) and three treatments at  25 mg/l ortho -
P (low ortho -phosphate LP), 50 mg/l ortho -P (medium  ortho -phosphate MP) and 75 mg/l ortho -P 
(high ortho -phosphate HP)  with three replicates each . Average total fish weight per system (±SD) was 
344 ± 7 g resulting in an initial density of 492 g/m².  Fish we re cultured for 56 days and fed ad libitum  
twice a day, 7 days per week with a commercial turbot feed (Aller 505 ex, Aller Aqua, Christiansfeld, 
Denmark). Uneaten pellets were netted out, counted and replaced half an hour after feeding in order to 
determin e daily feed intake. During the experimental period groups were changed randomly between 
experimental units every second week to minimize tank effects.  
 
b) growth study  
 
A total of 120 turbot with an average wet weight (±SD) of 17 ± 0 g (range 16.5 -17.5 g ) were randomly 
distributed to six separate experimental RAS, providing a control at 0 mg/l ortho -P (control C2) and 
treatment at  25 mg/l ortho -P (low ortho -phosphate LP2) with three replicates each .  Fish were cultured 
for 63 days and fed twice a day unti l apparent satiation. The diet was formulated to be low in total -P 
content and not limiting in essential amino acids (table 1) and  was manufactured using a pellet press at 
a temperature of 60 °C to 4 mm pellets (L 14 –175, AMANDUS KAHL, Reinbeck, Germany). 
Uneaten pellets were netted out, counted and replaced half an hour after feeding in order to determine 
daily feed intake. During the experimental period groups were changed every third week between 
tanks to minimize tank effects.

2.3 Water quality analysis  
 
Ortho -P was measured spectrophotometrically using a microplate reader Infinite 200 (Tecan, 
Männedorf, Switzerland) according to the protocols of Grasshof f et al (1983) and adapted to 
microplate format using the ascorbic acid method. Temperature, total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), NO 2-
N, NO 3-N, pH, salinity, flow rate and dissolved oxygen (DO) were measured weekly. TAN, NO 2-N 
and NO 3-N were determined spectropho tometrically using a HACH -DR 2800 spectrophotometer and 
powder pillow detection kits (Hach -Lange GmbH, Berlin, Germany)  based on the ammonia salicylate 
method, diazotization method and the cadmium reduction method, respectively. Temperature and pH 
were me asured with a WTW 340i portable multiparameter instrument (WTW GmbH, Weilheim, 
Germany). Salinity was determined with a digital refractometer  HI 96822 (HANNA Instruments, 
Woonsocket, USA) and  dissolved oxygen with a Handy Polaris oxygen probe (Oxygard Inte rnational 
A/S, Birkenrød, Denmark).  
 
2.4 Sampling  
 
During the toxicity experiment feed intake and mortality were recorded daily and group weight of fish 
was recorded every second week. Before final sampling fish were starved for 48 hours, at sampling 27 
 group weight as well as individual length and wet weight of fish were determined. Weight was 
recorded to the nearest 0.1 g, length was recorded to the nearest mm. Upon sampling three fish per 
tank were killed, liver and spleen were removed and weighed to the n earest 0.001 g. From three other 
fish blood samples were drawn from the caudal vein. For blood plasma -P analysis a subsample was 
immediately frozen on dry -ice and stored at -80° C. For total hemoglobin (total -Hb) a subsample was 
cooled on crushed ice and a nalyzed within 3 hours after sampling.   
For the growth experiment the sampling protocol was equal, except that 5 fish were sampled for 
intestinal analysis and five fish for blood analysis.  
 
2.5 Blood, fish and feed nutrient analysis  
 
Total -Hb was determine d by the cyanmethemoglobin method using a Hemoglobin FS reagent kit 
(DiaSys, International, Holzheim, Germany). Blood plasma -P was determined according to the 
protocol of Fiske and Subbarow (1925) and adapted to microplate format. All samples were measured  
in triplicates with a microplate reader Infinite 200 (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland). Diets and 
homogenized fish body samples were analyzed for dry matter (DM), ash, crude protein, crude fat and 
energy ash, calcium, total phosphorus and phytic acid (diets  only) according to EU guideline 
(EC/152/2009) (European Union, 2009). DM was determined after drying at 105 °C until weight 
remained stable and ash content after 4 h incineration at 550 °C with a combustion oven (P300; 
Nabertherm, Lilienthal, Germany). Cr ude protein content (N×6.25) was detected by the Kjeldahl 
method (InKjel 1225 M, WD 30; Behr, Düsseldorf, Germany), crude fat content after hydrolysis with 
hydrochloric acid followed by a petroleum ether extraction with a Soxleth extraction system (R 106 S ; 
Behr). Gross energy was measured in a bomb calorimeter (C 200; IKA, Staufen, Germany).  Nitrogen 
free extracts (NfE) were calculated by 100−(% crude protein+ % crude fat+ % ash).Total phosphorus , 
calcium was and phytic acid phosphorus was analyzed by ÖHMI Analytik GmbH (Magdeburg, 
Germany)  according to guidelines of ISO 11885 .

2.6 Data analysis  
 
Data are presented as mean ± s tandard deviation (SD) of n samples. Statistical analysis was performed 
using SPSS 17.0 (IBM inc, Armonk, USA). Data were tested for equal variances and for normality 
(p<0.05) using Levene’s test and the Shapiro -Wilk test, respectively. Multiple comparison s, for the 
toxicity experiment, were carried out by the parametric Tukey’s HSD, non -normality was only 
observed for splenic index (SI) so here or the non -parametric Dunnet’s T3 test was used. Single 
comparisons, for the growth experiment, were carried usin g the students T -test, in case of non -normal 
distribution, which was observed for SI, GPRE and PRE, the Mann -Whitney test was used. 
Differences were considered significant at p<0.05.  
 
3. Results  
 
3.1 Toxicity experiment  
 
All water quality parameters measu red were in the range that we evaluated as optimum range for 
turbot, at all sampling times and did not vary between treatments (table 3).  Average ortho -P level in C 
was 3.0±0.2 mg/l, for LP, MP and HP measured ortho -P concentrations (26.2±4.3, 51.8±2.1 and  
81.8±6.2 mg/l) were slightly higher than the nominal concentrations (25, 50 and 75 mg /l) (table 3).  29

No significant effect of any of the ortho -P levels tested on health parameters w as observed.  Mortality 
was low with 1 dead fish per treatment in C, MP and HP and no mortality in LP treatment (p>0.05). 
Average relative spleen size (SI) varied between 0.09 and 0.11 and did not show significant 
differences between treatments (p>0.05) neithe r did average heptosomatic index (HSI) which varied 
between 1.3 and 1.4 (p>0.05). Average condition factor (CF) varied between 2.1 and 2.2 (p>0.05) and 
did not show significant differences. Average total hemoglobin levels in blood ranged between 3.2 and 
3.5 g/dl were lowest for HP and highest for LP and showed significant differences between treatments 
(p>0.05). Blood plasma phosphorus levels varied between 6.7 mg/dl for MP treatment and 7.6 mg/dl 
for HP treatment but did not significantly vary (>0.05) (tab le 5).  
Significant effects of ortho -phosphate on production performance were found. Ortho -phosphate 
significantly affected daily feed intake (DFI) (p<0.01). DFI was lowest for the HP treatment 
(1.15±0.02) and highest for the LP treatment (1.42±0.03), diff erences were found significant (p<0.05) 
between C (1.35± 0.02) and HP and between LP and HP.  Ortho -P did not show an overall effect on 
feed conversion ratio (FCR) (p>0.05). Specific growth rate (SGR) showed an overall trend to 
dependent on ortho -P (p=0.05 8). SGR for the HP treatment (1.35±0.09) was lowest and SGR of the LP Treatment  Ortho -P

3.2 Growth experiment using low -P diets  
 
All water quality p arameters measured were in the optimum range for turbot at all sampling times and 
did not vary between treatments (table 3). Ortho -P concentration in control was 1.6±0.6 mg/l and in 
the LP2 treatment 24.7±4.0 mg/l. 
During the 63 days experimental period no  mortalities occurred. HSI and SI of control groups were 
lower compared to LP2 treatments and did significantly vary (HSI: C2=1.41±0.31 LP=1.83±0.34, 
p=0.002 and SI: C2=0.08± 0.03, LP2=0.13 ± 0.06, p= 0.044).  No significant effect of ortho -P was 
observed on condition factor (p=0.922), total -HB ( p=0.781) or blood plasma P levels (p=0.205). DFI 
was higher for LP2 treatment compared to C2 but differences were not significant (LP2=0.95 ± 0.04, 
C2=1.02±0.05, p=0.100), however total feed intake was significantl y higher for LP2 (p=0.047). FCR 
was comparable between treatments (C2=1.17±0.08, LP2=1.15±0.03, p=0.671). As a result of equal 
FCR and higher feed intake biomass gain was also significantly higher in the LP2 treatment (p=0.022). 
Ortho -P increased therefore  the SGR with approximately 10%, resulting in significant higher growth 
rates (LP2= 0.92 ± 0.03, C2=0.83 ± 0.03, p=0.014).

 4. Discussion  
  
During both experimental periods all measured water quality parameters were in the optimal range as 
described in table 3. No significant differences within expe rimental treatments, with the exception of 
ortho -P, were observed for both experiments. Therefore effects observed are thought to be 
monofactorial, resulting from inorganic phosphorus treatments. Average ortho -P levels for control 
treatments C was 3.0 mg/l C and for C2 1.6 mg/l, these levels are comparable to average ortho -
phosphate concentrations in commercial partial RAS systems with daily exchange rates of 50% (≈ 
4000 l/kg feed) (Aubin et al., 2006). Ortho -P concentrations for LP1 and LP2 treatments were  25 
respectively 26 mg/l and are comparable to ortho -P levels reached in experimental RAS with water 
exchange rates of 30 -120 l/kg feed (Martins et al. 2009a, Schneider et al. 2006). Concentrations of 
ortho -P obtained in MP and HP treatments (52 mg/l respe ctively 82 mg/l) are not likely to occur in 
commercial turbot RAS yet, but concentrations above 40 mg/l are observed in fresh water RAS 
(Schneider et al. 2006), and can become realistic in turbot RAS when water exchange rates are further 
minimized.     
 
4.1 Toxicity of ortho -phoshate  
 
To our knowledge this is the first research studying the chronic effect of elevated ortho -phosphate 
concentrations on health and or production performance of marine fish species, therefore literature that 
is directly comparab le is lacking. Epifanio and Srna (1975) determined LC -50 for two oyster species 
(Mercenaria mercenaria and Crassostrea virginica ), however exposure to 3 -19 mg/l ortho -P, added as 
sodium -phosphate, did not result in any mortality and concentrations of 3 -25 mg/l ortho -P did not 
show any effect on feed intake A 5 month exposure of abalone  (Haliotis iris )  to 0.3 -3.5 mg/l ortho -P 
did not results in higher mortalities compared to a control, but concentrations above 0.3 mg/l 
significantly affected shell growth an d weight gain (James and Barr, 2012). For fresh water fish 
species LC -50 values for sodium phosphate and tri -sodium phosphate exists. Reported 96 h LC -50 
values of tri -sodium phosphate for African catfish ( Clarias garipinus ) is 61 mg/l ortho -P (Ufodike & 
Onusiriuka, 1990), 96 h LC -50 values for the western mosquito fish ( Gambusia affinis ) is 186 mg P/l 
added as sodium phosphate and 28.5 mg P/l as tri -sodium phosphate (Wallen et al., 1957). The higher 
toxicity of tri -sodium phosphate compared to sodium phosp hate is probably the result of sodium 
presence and not of phosphate toxicity. In contrast to marine species, which are hypotonic compared 
to their environment and therefore constantly drinking water and enriching itself with ions, fresh water 
species drink  occasionally and have to absorb the majority of ions through the skin or the gills 
(Kaushik, 2001) . Comparison between marine and fresh water species might therefore be 
inappropriate and reported LC -50 values are underestimated due to sodium toxicity .  35 
 After mortality being the most severe toxicity indicator, physiological changes might be an indicator 
for sub -lethal exposure of fish to toxins. Changes in the  HSI of flatfish are an indicator of chronic 
exposure to water borne toxins (Lye et al., 1997,  Pereira et al., 1993 ). During the present toxicity study 
the average HSI varied between 1.3 and 1.4 but no significant differences between treatments were 
found. An increased SI in flatfish is another indicator of exposure to toxins (Hutchinson and Manning, 
1996, van Bussel et al., 2012b) but during the present toxicity study no significant increase in SI was 
observed. In addition average plasma -P levels ranged between 6.7 and 7.6 mg P/dl and did not vary 
between treatments. Values are comparable to plasma P va lues of 8.1 mg P/ dl observed for turbot 
(Payan et al. 1997) and 6.4-8.2 mg P/dl  observed for Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus ) 
(Kikuchi, 1999) suggesting that values measured during our study are within the normal range . Urasa 
and Wendelaar Bonga (1987) measured blood plasma phosphate values of tilapia ( Oreochromis 
mossambicus)  by elevated orthophosphate concentrations and found only significant elevations of P in 
blood when water P concentrations exceeded plasma P concentrations. During the presen t toxicity 
study average water ortho -phosphate levels for C, LP and MP treatments were below average blood 
plasma phosphate concentrations, plasma -P was thus hypertonic compared to the environment. In the 
HP treatment average water ortho -P concentration wa s 81.8 ± 6.2 mg/l, thus slightly exceeding blood 
plasma ortho -P concentrations, but this was not reflected in blood -P levels.  
In the present toxicity study the daily feed intake of the HP treatment was significantly lower 
compared to the daily feed intake of C but feed conversion ratio was not significantly affected by 
ortho -P concentrations. This is in line with studies for chronic effects of ammonia and nitrate to turbot 
were feed intake was the most sensitive parameter leading to reduced growth, whereas feed conversion 
ratio was unchanged at the same concentrations (Person -Le Ruyet et al., 1997, van Bussel et al., 
2012b). The reduced feed intake might be a result of osmotic stress (Boeuf & Payan 2001) caused by 
hypertonic ortho -P concentrations in the wat er. Specific growth rates of C1 did not significantly vary 
compared to other treatments, however SGR of LP was found significantly higher compared to HP.  
We conclude that ortho -P does not affect health of turbot, even at concentrations as high as 82 mg/l, 
normal growth and feed intake was observed between 3 and 52 mg/l and concentrations should not 
exceed this range. To obtain maximal feed intake phosphate concentrations managed at concentrations 
of ± 25 mg/l.   
 
4.2 Effect of ortho -phosphate at optimum co ncentrations  
 
Using non -linear regression the ortho -P concentration for highest feed intake and growth during the 
toxicity experiment was found at around 27 mg/l (figure 1). The higher feed intake, by equal feed 
efficiency resulting thus in higher growth w as also observed during the second experiments were 
turbot were fed the low -P diets, and results of both experiments were thus in line. However in the 
growth experiment differences were found in liver and spleen size. As discussed before an increased 36 
 HSI a nd SI might be indications of water borne toxicity but these effects were not observed during the 
toxicity study with much higher concentrations. The HSI can also indicate the nutritional state of 
turbot, commonly increasing with improving nutritional stat e (Arfsten et al., 2010). Thus the increased 
HSI and SI are thus rather  an indirect effect of higher feed intake, than a direct effect of ortho -P.  
Improved water quality can lead to increased feed intake and might be a possible explanation for the 
increas ed feed intake and higher growth performance. Addition of ortho -phosphate is increases pH and 
total alkalinity but during the present study no significant differences in pH were observed. Ortho -
phosphate is also known to reduce nitrite toxicity in fresh wa ter (Russo et al, 1981), however 
considering the high salinity and low nitrite concentrations this is not likely to explain differences in 
feed intake. Earl & Whiteman (2010) reported that frog tadpoles raised for 15 days in control 
treatment (0 mg/l ortho -P) and a high phosphate treatment (200 mg/l ortho -P) had significant lower 
condition factor and bodymass compared to a treatment of 100 mg/l ortho -P. Furthermore, the 
presence of fungus  (Saprolegnia sp .) was also lower in the 10 -200 mg/l ortho -P treatment s compared 
to the control but in contrast  the high salinity and the absence of any external health differences in 
feed intake during the present study cannot be explained with the previous study. Schram et al. (2009) 
reported a significant higher motivati on to eat in medium sized turbot (500 -700 g) raised in RAS (1.4 
and 5.0 m³/kg feed) compared to flow through systems (70 m³/kg feed), but no significant effect on 
growth was found. Martins et al. (2010) reported that small tilapia were significantly more m otivated 
to eat and grew significantly faster in  RAS with water renewal rates of 70 l/kg feed, compared to RAS 
with water exchange rates of 1500 l/kg feed. Increased water re -use, and thus a higher accumulation of 
in-organics including ortho -P, is thus kn own to positively affect the feeding motivation of fish. This 
enhanced motivation to eat might be an explanation for the higher feed intake observed in the present 
study.      
Another mechanism that might affect feed intake and growth of turbot is the upta ke and utilization of 
ortho -P from water. Uptake of the minerals Ca+, Mg+, Na+ and Cl- by rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus 
mykiss ) from saline water, and its contribution to nutrition is reported by several authors and is 
reviewed by Timmons and Ebeling (2010).  In fresh water tilapia species ( Oreochromis. sp .) can 
uptake of ortho -phosphate from the water through the gills and the gastro intestinal tract (Al -Kholy et 
al., 1970, Urasa and Wendelaar Bonga 1987) and can utilize this for growth when fed high -P and lo w-
P diets in restricted amounts, leading to higher feed utilization efficiencies (Eding et al., 2012). Uptake 
and utilization of ortho -phosphate seems to be less in marine species compared to fresh water species. 
For example Lall & Bishop (1979) cultured r ainbow trout ( O. mykiss ) in both freshwater and seawater 
for 12 weeks fed with the same diet. Fish raised in freshwater had higher Ca and P content in the body 
than those reared in seawater. Similar observations have been made for Atlantic salmon ( Salmo sa lar) 
fed with same diets but raised in fresh or seawater  (Shearer, 1993). Indirect evidence of ortho -P uptake 
by marine fish using retentions experiments fed deficient P diets is reported by several authors and 
some fish react by increasing their feed inta ke, however this seem to be species dependent (Cowey, 37 
 1995, Dias, 2005,  Pimentel -Rodr igues & Oliva -Teles, 2001 , Laining, et al. 2012, Oliva -Teles & 
Pimentel -Rodrigues, 2004, Roy & Lall, 2003, Uyan et al., 2007). In all studies an increased FCR by 
phosphoru s deficient diets was observed.  During the growth study the FCR for both treatments was 
around 1.16 and is comparable to FCR of  1.0-1.2 reported in studies using low fishmeal (80 -150 g / kg 
feed) with a phosphorus content of 7.0 - 18.8 g P /kg diet (Kroecke l et al., 2012, Nagel et al, 2012, 
Slawski et al., 2011). During the toxicity study available phosphorus content of the diet was 14.5 g/kg, 
during the growth trial using low -P diets available phosphorus content was 5.5 g/kg diet and estimated 
digestible P was 4.6 g/kg diet. Dietary requirements for turbot ( P. maxima ) are unknown, but dietary 
requirement for juvenile Japanese flounder ( P. olivaceus ) range between 4.5 and 5.1 g TP / kg diet 
(Wang et al., 2005, Choi et al., 2005). During the present study avai lable phosphorus retention was 
above 80% in the C2 treatment and almost reached 100% in the LP2 treatment. Typical phosphorus 
deficiency symptoms such as deformities of vertebrae and skull and decrease of ash content were not 
observed, but turbot raised in  the control group showed a trend to have a higher whole body crude 
lipid content which is also considered to be a typical phosphorus deficiency symptom (Kaushik, 2001). 
This might be an indication that turbot can prevail dietary phosphorus deficiency effe cts by uptake and 
utilization of water borne P, and regulate feed intake accordingly. Although ortho -P did not improve 
FCR, crude protein retention showed a trend to increase with increased ortho -P, an effect which was 
also observed for tilapia (Eding et a l., 2012), which can be another indication that turbot are able to 
use ortho -P for metabolism and regulate feed intake accordingly.  
Considering the absence of negative effects of ortho -P on the health of turbot, the accumulation of 
ortho -P is not a risk fo r optimal production in intensive turbot RAS. The positive effects of ortho -P 
levels at around 25 mg/l on feed intake, protein utilization and growth of turbot during the present 
study, make the accumulation in RAS even desirable. Therefore, if denitrifica tion is used, water 
exchange should be managed at rates that maintain ortho -P levels constant at 25 mg/l in order to 
improve production performance of turbot. Studies on phosphorus requirements of turbot in flow 
through systems and intensive RAS are recomm ended to determine phosphorus requirements of turbot 
in order to reduce eutrophication effects caused by turbot RAS production.    
 
5. Conclusions  
Based on the given results we can conclude that ortho -P does not negatively affect health of turbot in 
the te sted range of 3 -82 mg/l and concentrations between 3 and 52 mg/l do not negatively affect 
production performance. The accumulation of ortho -phosphate is thus not likely to affect health of 
turbot in RAS. Concentrations of around 25 mg/l do increase feed in take and growth of turbot and 
water exchange rates or phosphate removal should be managed to keep ortho -P levels around 25 mg/l.

 Abstract  
 
Developments in RAS production are characterized by intensific ation of production, resulting in 
decreased water use per volume of fish produced. As a result metabolites, including the main dietary 
metals Fe, Zn, Cu, Co and Mn, accumulate in the culture water. Effect of such sub -lethal  
concentrations of these metals o n growth and health of marine fish species is still unknown  
Therefore lab scale RAS were filled with seawater and a mixture of Fe, Zn, Cu, Co and Mn, 
representing different culture intensities. The amounts added simulated water exchange rates of 1000, 
330, 100, 33 and 10 l/kg feed applied. Metal concentrations in water were monitored over time. 
During exposure 90 juvenile turbot ( Psetta maxima ) (16.8±0.1 g) were randomly divided over the 5 
RAS, fed ad libitum  with a commercial diet and exposed for 63 days.   
Water concentrations of Zn, Cu and Co were stable over time. Fe showed a quick precipitation in RAS 
water, t 1/2 was 1.4±0.7 d. Mn showed a slower breakdown in RAS, t 1/2 was 6.3±0.4 d.  
Production performance, assed as growth, feed intake and feed conversio n was not significantly 
affected by treatment (p>0.05). Health status assessed as mortality, relative liver size, relative spleen 
size and total hemoglobin content was neither significant affected by treatment (p>0.05).  
Amounts of metals in RAS water were  reflected in turbot body composition. Correlations between 
exposure and body composition were found significant (p<0.05) for Zn, Mn and Co but not for Fe and 
Cu. Dry matter content significantly decreased with increased metal content (p<0.05), in contrast  
crude ash content not.  
Although body composition is slightly changed by metal exposure, the absence of effects on health 
and production performance suggests that metal accumulation is not a limiting factor for turbot grow -
out in RAS yet. However by inten sification of marine RAS production zinc accumulation can become 
potentially toxic and should be monitored carefully.

 1. Introduction  
 
Fish production in land based recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) is steadily growing since 
decades. Due to incre ased costs for make -up water and waste -water discharge and separation of waste 
streams there is a trend in RAS towards intensification of water re -use by technical improvements of 
water treatment (Blancheton et al., 2007). Especially in culture systems usi ng high density of fish per 
water volume, such as race -way systems for shrimp or flatfish culture, feed originating substances do 
accumulate to high levels.  
In the nutrition of turbot ( Psetta maxima ) much effort was given over the last years to reduce the  
inclusion of fishmeal protein by alternative animal or plant based proteins (Burel et al., 2000, Nagel et 
al., 2012, Kroeckel et al., 2012). The ash fraction of these alternative protein sources is considerably 
lower in available trace -minerals like iron,  zinc, copper, cobalt, manganese, nickel, chromium, 
selenium (Hertrampf and Piedad -Pascual, 2000). All these trace minerals are essential chemical 
elements, involved in the normal metabolism of fish (Wanatabe et al., 1997). Thus by replacing fish 
proteins sources by plant based protein sources, mineral deficiencies might occur resulting in 
decreased growth and poorer health status (Kaushik, 1999). To overcome these deficiencies, trace -
elements are added to commercial diets in the form of pre -mixes. Premixes  for marine fish species 
included zinc sulfate, copper sulfate, cobalt sulfate and manganese sulfate (Kaushik, 1999). 
Furthermore contamination of raw materials or make up water can be a source of minerals. Therefore 
increasing re -use of water leads to inc reased accumulation of like Arsenic, Barium, Boron, Copper, 
Iron, Lithium, Manganese, Nickel, Strontium and Zinc in fresh water RAS (Martins et al., 2009, 
Martins et al., 2011, Davidson et al., 2009, Davidson et al. 2011).  
Several studies have shown that increased re -use of water in RAS leads to elevated concentrations of 
metals in liver or muscle tissue of fish. Increased levels of Arsenic, Lead, Chromium and Manganese 
were found in muscle or liver of Nile tilapia ( Oreochromis niloticus ) raised in fresh w ater (Martins et 
al. 2011) and increased levels of chromium, manganese, cobalt, nickel, copper, arsenic, thallium,  
cadmium were observed in European seabass ( Dicentrarchus labrax ) raised marine water (Deviller et 
al., 2005). It was suggested that the accu mulation of metals was a likely cause of higher mortality, 
deformation and lower hatching success for carp ( Cyprinus carpio ) larvae (Martins et al., 2009), 
increased mortality and higher occurrence of deformities in rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ) 
(Dav idson et al., 2009) and 15 % growth reduction of European seabass ( D. labrax ) (Deviller et al., 
2005).  
Although all these authors suggest a linkage between metal concentrations and fish health or growth 
no causal conclusion can be drawn from these studies because intensification of water re -use changes 
multiple parameters, but sub -lethal effects of these metals, relevant for concentrations observed in 
RAS, are unknown. Therefore maximal allowable concentrations of metals in the culture water have to 
be dete rmined to manage water renewal rates and to optimize treatment techniques.   46 
 Thus in the present study, metal concentrations were artificially increased by adding the above 
mentioned metals in the sulphate form, to obtain a mono -variate study. This study w as limited to the 5 
main essential dietary metals; iron, zinc, copper, cobalt and manganese. Furthermore metal 
concentrations in a 45 m³ turbot RAS and in a commercial turbot diet were measured to link 
experimental concentrations with praxis data.

2. Material & Me thods  
 
2.1 Experimental setup  
 
The experimental set -up and data analysis were carried out in accordance to OECD TG215; Fish, 
Juvenile growth test  (OECD/OCDE, 2000). 5 different metal concentrations, in a log -linear design 
were randomly divided over the 5 R AS. Because fish size was very homogeneous ( 16.8 ± 0.1 gram)  
pseudo -specific growth rates could be calculated, additionally data were analyzed by regression 
(concentration -response modeling) (OECD/OCDE, 2000). Juvenile turbot were obtained from 
Maximus A/S  (Bedsted Thy, Denmark) and acclimatized to culturing systems at the facilities of the 
GMA (Büsum, Germany) for one week prior to the nine week experimental exposure. For a detailed 
system and management description see van Bussel et al. (2012). Briefly 5 RAS, consisting of a 
mechanical particle filter, moving bed biofilm reactor and a protein skimmer using compressed air, 
were stocked with 18 juvenile turbot each. At the start and after every three weeks, RAS were filled 
with 300 l disinfected sea water (2 6 ppt) and a mixture of ZnSO 4*7 H 2O, MnSO 4* H 2O, CoSO 4*7 
H2O, CuSO 4* 5 H 2O and FeSO 4* 7 H 2O was added to obtain desired metal concentrations. Sodium 47 
 sulfate was added to all tanks to obtain equal amounts of sulfate in all tanks. Test solution was 
exchanged  every three weeks to minimize accumulation of metabolics. Amounts of metals added were 
based on assumptions of commercial production system:  
 amount of minerals in a standard marine diet (table 1),  
 a stocking density of 50 kg /m3 
 an average feed intake (ov er the whole production cycle) of 1% bdw per day,  
 cumulative feed burden (CFB) by water exchange rates of 1000, 330, 100, 33 and 10 l/kg feed.   
 
CFB = Feed added (g) / V total (l) ^ ( -V/V total)        (1) 
 
where “feed added” is the simulated amount of fee d added per tank in g, “V total“ is the total culture 
volume and “ –V” is the amount of water replaced.  
 
With the standard mineral content (table 1) and the calculated CFB the potential amount of metals that 
accumulate can be calculated and is given in tabl e 2. Treatments were named after exchange rates; 
1000 liters per kg feed applied (ER -1000), 330 liters per kg feed applied (ER -330), 100 liters per kg 
feed applied (ER-100), 33 liters per kg feed applied (ER -33) and 10 liter per kg feed applied (ER -10). 
Temperature was not controlled internally and thus controlled by room temperature. Fish were fed ad 
libitum  twice a day, 7 days per week with a commercial turbot feed (56% CP, 18% CL, 1.6% TP, on 
dry weight basis) . Uneaten pellets were netted out and counted  within one hour after feeding .  
To study the risk of accumulation concentrations were added in a log -linear design and metal 
concentrations in the water were measured regularly to estimate half -life times, and thus asses the risk 
of accumulation.  Growth,  health parameters and body composition were evaluated after 9 weeks of 
exposure.

2.2 Water quality, fish and feed nutrient content analysis  
 
Temperature, total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), NO 2-N, NO 3-N, pH, salinity, flow rate and dissolved 
oxygen (DO) were measure d twice a week. TAN, NO 2-N and NO 3-N were determined 
spectrophotometrically using a HACH -DR 2800 spectrophotometer (Hach -Lange GmbH, Berlin, 
Germany) and powder pillow detection kits based on the ammonia salicylate method, diazotization 
method and the cadm ium reduction method, respectively (Hach -Lange GmbH, Berlin, Germany). 
Temperature and pH were measured with a WTW 340i portable multiparameter instrument (WTW 
GmbH, Weilheim, Germany). Salinity was determined with a digital refractometer  HI 96822 
(HANNA I nstruments, Woonsocket, USA) , dissolved oxygen with a Handy Polaris oxygen probe 
(Oxygard International A/S, Birkenrød, Denmark). Dissolved metals were analyzed at nine sampling 
dates in duplicate using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry  (ICP-MS) method (TeLa, 
Technische Lebensmittel - und Umweltanalytik GmbH, Bremerhafen, Germany) in 100 ml samples. 
Detection limits were <0.01 mg/l for Fe, <0.01 mg/l for Zn, <0.01 mg/l for Cu, < 0 .002 mg/l for Co 
and <0,004  mg/l for Mn. Alkalinity was determined a ccording to Grashoff et al. (1999).  
From each tank 9 fish were freeze dri ed and grinded. Diets and homogenized fish body samples were 
analyzed for dry matter (DM), ash and metals. DM was determined after drying at 105 °C until weight 
remained stable and a sh content after 4 h incineration at 550 °C with a combustion oven (P300; 
Nabertherm, Lilienthal, Germany). For metal analysis 50 gram of homogenized freeze dried sample 
were digested using hydrofluoric acid, nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by microwave 
heating. Digested samples were than analyzed using ICP -MSmethod (TeLa, Technische Lebensmittel - 
und Umweltanalytik GmbH, Bremerhafen, Germany).  Metal content was expressed as mg metal per 
kg dry matter.   
 
2.3 Sampling  
 
During the experimental p eriod feed intake and mortality were recorded daily, group weight weekly. 
After 63 days of exposure group weight as well as individual length and wet weight of fish were 
determined. Weight was recorded to the nearest 0.1 g, length was recorded to the neare st mm. Upon 
sampling nine fish per tank were killed, liver and spleen were removed and weighed to the nearest 
0.001 g. The other nine fish were killed and used for proximate body composition analysis.  
 
 
2.5 Data analysis  
 49 
 Toxicity experiments and data anal ysis were carried out in accordance to OECD TG215; Fish, 
Juvenile growth test  (OECD/OCDE, 2000) with the exception that turbot ( P. maxima ) was used 
instead of one of the recommended fresh water species and that the experiment lasted 63 days instead 
of 28 d ays. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) of n samples. Half life time of metal 
in water was calculated as:  
 
T1/2 = (t*log(2)) / log(C t / C t+x)         (2) 
 
Were C t is initial concentration, C t+x is concentration at time=x and t is time be tween t and tx (d). 
Exposure was calculated as the sum of the daily average concentrations of metals. Fish date were 
analyzed in accordance to ‘OECD TG215; Fish, Juvenile growth test’ (OECD/OCDE, 2000) using an 
ANOVA and ordinary linear regression. Statist ical analysis was performed using SPSS 17.0 (IBM inc, 
Armonk, USA). Data were tested for normality and for equal variances (p<0.05) using Levene’s test 
and the Kolgomorov -Smirnov test, respectively. Multiple comparisons were carried out by the 
parametric T ukey’s HSD or the non -parametric Dunnet’s T3 test.  Differences were considered 
significant at p<0.05.  For growth parameters, feed utilization and body metals concentration data was 
analyzed using or Grahpad Prism 5.00 ( GraphPad Software, San Diego, USA ). Data were analyzed 
using ordinary linear regression and slopes were compared using an F -test. Differences were 
considered significant at p<0.05.  
 
3. Results  
 
3.1 Water quality parameters  
 
Water temperature, salinity, oxygen, pH, dissolved nitrogen (TAN, NO 2, NO 3) and ortho -phosphate 
did not show significant differences between treatments (table 3). For metals significant differences 
between treatments were only observed for Zn, Cu and Co (table 3). Due to high Zn and Co levels in 
the initial seawater, Zn and Co concentrations in ER -1000, ER -333 and ER -100 treatments were 
higher than nominal values, however increase of Zn and Co were comparable to nominal added 
amounts. Cu levels in the ER -1000 and ER -330 were higher as nominal values due to the initial  
seawater matrix, whereas ER -33 and ER -10 levels were less than 10 % of the nominal concentration.  
For Fe and Mn no significant differences between averages were observed because the breakdown 
over time resulted in high standard deviation of the average conce ntration (table 3 and figure 1).Fe 
could only be detected in the first two days after addition for the two highest treatments (ER10 and ER 
33) thereafter values were at or below detection limit (0.01 mg/l). Observed half -life time of Fe for 
measured concen tration in ER10 was 1.4 ± 0.7 days. Mn was above detection limits at all sampling 50 
 events for ER10 but not for other treatments. Observed half -life time for Mn in ER10 treatment was 
6.3±0.4 days.

 3.2 Fish performance and health status  
 
Fish performance and health status were compared using an ANOVA in the case of multiple 
observations per treatment. No significant differences (p>0.05) in an y of the measured parameters 
were observed. All health and production performance parameters were linear regressed with the CFB. 
The low observed correlation (R²=0.00 -0.38) suggested that there was no correlation at al between 
metal concentration and healt h or production performance and therefore no significant effect (p>0.05) 
of CFB on health or production performance was observed (table 4).

3.3 Fish body composition  
 
There was no relation between ash content in whole body and simulated CFB (R²=0.03) and therefore 
no effect of metal accumulation on crude ash content. In contrast dry matter conte nt in fish whole 
body showed a negative relation with simulated CFB, this relation fitted well (R²=0.83) and was found 
significant (p<0.05) different from 0. Metal content in whole body dry matter showed a positive 
relation with metal exposure for all meta ls. A good correlation (R²>0.8) was only found for Zn, Co 
and Mn, and these correlations were also considered significant (p<0.05) (figure 2).

4. Discussion  
  
4.1 General water quality parameters  
 
During the 63 day exposure time all measured water quality parameters,  with the exception of metals, 
were all in the optimum range for turbot (Person -Le Ruyet et al., 1997, Bianchini et al., 1996, Boeuf et 
al., 1999, van Bussel et al. 2012, Pichevant et al. 2000, Person -Le Ruyet et al., 2002, Imsland et al., 
53 
 1996, Schram et al., 2009, Imsland et al. 2001, Imsland et al., 2002). Differences observed between 
treatments are, therefore, thought to be monofactorial, resulting from differences in metal 
concentrations during exposure.  
 
4.2 Metal behavior  in marine RAS water  
 
Mn conc entrations during the first sampling event after mineral mixture addition were comparable to 
added nominal concentrations, but showed a clear breakdown over time with an estimated half -life 
time of ca. 6 days. Fe showed also a clear breakdown however conce ntrations during the first sampling 
event, were less than 2 % of the nominal values. Estimated half life time of the residual Fe was ca. 1.5 
days.  
The behavior of these metals in marine RAS environment can be explained by their chemical 
characteristics. Zi nc and Cobalt are highly soluble in seawater and for both Zn2+ and Co2+ are the main 
and stable forms present in natural seawater (Long and Angino, 1977, Ellwood and van den Berg, 
2001) and formation of complexes with humic acids are low in seawater (Manto ura et al., 1978). 
Copper is also highly soluble in (saline) water and Cu2+ is the main form (Long and Angino, 1977) but 
in natural marine water, which contains Ca and organics, Cu2+ is known to form complexes with 
humic acids or other ligands (Herring and  Morel, 1988). In intensive RAS, humic -acid bound copper 
is thus the main form present but when humic acid is oxidized copper will bind to other organics. In 
marine environment Iron exists in the Fe2+ form, which is highly soluble in water, and Fe3+ form, with 
an extreme low solubility of 0.2 -0.6 nM (Millero, 1998). Oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ in marine water is 
fast, the half -life time is <3 hours (Roekens and van Grieken 1983). As a result Iron will quickly 
precipitate in marine RAS. During the present stud y decrease in dissolved manganese levels was 
observed in the two lowest exchange rates. Manganese is highly soluble in seawater, however 
precipitation, absorption on detritus and interactions with iron, the formation of ferromanganese 
nodules, will reduce free Mn in RAS water (Bender et al., 1977).  
Concentrations of metals during the present experiment for the ER -1000 and ER -330 treatment do 
reflect praxis concentrations for a typical turbot RAS with exchange rates of 455 l/kg feed, with the 
exception that  Cu concentrations were below 10 µg /l in the 45 m³ RAS. In freshwater RAS (table 6) 
concentrations of Fe and Cu are generally higher in fresh water, were as Zn concentrations are lower, 
due to different behavior of metals in marine waters.  
 
4.4 Metal upt ake, bioaccumulation and effects on marine fish.  
 
Effects of metals on fresh water fish are well studied, and toxicity models are formulated all based on 
the hardness of the water (and on other metals do compete for binding at the gill membrane, affecting 
the toxicity of a specific metal due to competition (Diamond et al., 1992, Marr et al., 1998, McGeer 54 
 2000, Pagenkopf,  1983, Playle, 1998, Stubblefield et al., 1997). In marine water this is not so clear 
and toxicity is more dependent on salinity and thus o smoregulation, e.g. by drinking water (Grosell et 
al., 2004, Grosell et al., 2007,  Partridge and Lymbery, 2009). During the present study no significant 
differences in growth performance or health parameters were observed. More distinct, correlation 
coeffi cients between simulated water exchange and growth or health parameters were extremely low, 
indicating very clear that in the tested range there was no effect of metals on production performance 
or health (table 4). Although production performance and heal th parameters were not affected, an 
effect on dry weight content of the body and metal bioaccumulation were observed. Differences in 
metal content in the flesh of farmed turbot compared to caught turbot are observed for Cobalt, Copper, 
Iron, Manganese and Zinc (Martinez et al., 2010), but this can be a (combined) effect of diet or 
environment. For seabass ( D. labrax ) it was observed that at least differences in bioaccumulation of 
Mn, Co and Cu are caused by water exchange rates, e.g. matrix (Deviller et al. , 2005). Therefore 
uptake and bioaccumulation of individual metals by marine fish is discussed.  
Iron uptake. Marine fish species take up ions mainly through the intestine, but in seawater Fe 
(III) is the main form present, and has a low bio -availability to  fish (Bury and Grosel, 2003). Despite 
the lower bioavailability some uptake of Fe3+ in the posterior part of the intestine of European flounder 
does takes place (Bury et al., 2001). However considering the low solubility of Fe in marine water and 
the low drinking rate of 1 ml/kg/h for turbot (Caroll et al., 1994) it can be estimated aquous uptake is 
only a fraction of the daily dietary Fe intake. This is in line with the low correlation between Fe 
exposure and Fe body content observed during the present st udy. Therefore we consider aqueous Fe 
accumulation in marine RAS not a relevant health or growth affecting issue.  
Zinc uptake.  In marine fish uptake of zinc takes place in the anterior region of the digestive 
tract as it was demonstrated for winter flound er (Shears and Fletcher, 1983) and aqueous Zn can 
contributes for 20 -40 % of the total zinc uptake (Hoss, 1964, Renfro et al.,  1975, Willis and Sunda, 
1984). Zinc homeostasis is maintained in fish by regulating the excretory mechanisms and controlling 
the gastrointestinal uptake (Wannatabe et al., 1997), preventing dietary toxicity as is reported for 
turbot exposed to high (1100 mg Zn/kg) dietary zinc (Overnell et al, 1988). Aqueous zinc seems much 
more toxic with reported 96h LC -50 values for marine fish s pecies range between 8 and 21.5 mg/l 
(Taylor et al., 1985, Mohapatra and Rengarajan 1997, Rajkumar et al., 2011). However it can be 
questioned if LC -50 values are a relevant value for safe culture of fish in RAS. Reported 96 h LC -50 
values for red sea brea m (Pagrus major ) larvae are as high as 10.1 mg/l, but increased deformities and 
increased mortality of larvae are already observed at 0.3 mg/l after 10 days of exposure (Huang et al., 
2010).  During the present experiment exposure to sublethal concentratio ns of aqueous zinc did not 
influence health or production performance of turbot, but led to bioaccumulation of zinc. This is in 
line with observation of McGeer et al. (2000) who exposed rainbow trout to sub -lethal zinc 
concentrations and did not find diffe rences in feed intake, growth or FCR, although significant ionic 
imbalances in the blood as well as Zn accumulation in the gills were observed. The absence of 55 
 negative effects of sublethal aquous zinc on growth, feed intake or feed utilization is also repo rted for 
parr ( Salmo salar ) (Farmer and Ashfield, 1970). Furthermore these authors reported bioaccumulation 
of zinc combined with a decreased caloric content of the whole body. Although a proximate body 
analysis was not done, it is very likely that the red uced caloric content was caused by an increased 
incorporation of water in the tissue, as is also reported for clam exposed to aqueous zinc (Belanger et 
al., 1986). These observations might explain the significant negative relation between dry matter 
conten t of the turbot and water exchange rates observed during the present study.  
Copper uptake. Fish appear to be more tolerant of copper in the diet than of dissolved copper 
in the water. Acute  lethal concentrations (LC -50) of copper sulfate vary between >0.1  to 1.5 mg /l 
copper, for  both marine and fresh water fish species (Friedman and Shibko, 1972, Taylor et al, 1985, 
Grosell et al., 2007)  although mainly osmolality physiology can reduce LC -50 values for Cu a 50 -fold 
(Grosell et al., 2007). Due to complex formation of Cu in seawater, the bio -availability of Cu is low. 
Furthermore it is known that dissolved organic carbon reduces Cu toxicity even more. For the 
sensitive mussel embryos ( Mytilus trossolus ) LC -50 values were increased a 4 fold (Nadella et al., 
2009). In marine fish it is observed that sub -lethal exposure to copper leads to an initial 
bioaccumulation of Cu in gills and intestine, however after an 8 day period stable levels of Cu were 
maintained suggesting excretion or impairment of Cu (Grosell et  al., 2004). Although this effect is not 
studied for turbot it might be an explanation for the low correlation between Cu bioaccumulation and 
exposure in the present study.  
Manganese uptake . The uptake of manganese by fish from water has been demonstrated  
(Miller et al., 1980; Srivastava and Agarwal,1983) but the mechanism s of manganese uptake are not 
clear and is low, dietary uptake is the main source of Mn. For marine fish, data available are limited to 
a study comparing effects on juvenile mulloway ( Argyrosomus japonicus ) exposed to 0 or 5 mg/l Mn 
at 3 different salinities for two weeks. At all 3 different salinities mullets showed decreased feed 
intake, lower feed efficiency and as a result lower or even negative growth, as well as Mn 
bioaccumulation in  all tissues sampled (Partridge and Lymbery, 2009). Deviller et al. (2005) found 
that bioaccumulation of Mn in seabass ( D. labrax ) was dependent on water exchange rates.  Results of 
these studies are thus in line with present findings, were bioaccumulation  of Mn was found significant.    
 Cobalt uptake . Both dietary and aqueous cobalt can function as cobalt source, aqueous uptake 
is dependent on water temperature and alkalinity (Phillips et al., 1957). For fresh water fishes toxicity 
of cobalt increases wit h decreased water hardness and is species dependent, no observed 
concentrations vary between 0.3 and 4 mg/l although inhibition of feeding is reported at 
concentrations of 4.8 mg/l (Diamond et al., 1992, Hassan et al., 1992 Marr et al., 1998). For marine 
water no data exist but the accumulation of Co in tissue of seabass ( D. labrax ) is reported (Deviller et 
al., 2005). Present findings also show that bioaccumulation of Co trough water takes place.  
 
  56 
 4.5 Potential risks of metal accumulation in marine RAS o n fish production  
 
Both feed and make up -water are potential sources of metal accumulation in RAS (Davidson et al., 
2009). Based on dietary requirements of metals by marine fish (table 1) and the metal composition in 
the commercial diet used (table 5) it c an be concluded differences between requirements and dietary 
content of zinc shows a large discrepancy. Based on the seawater analysis (table 3), seawater is a 
potential source for both Zinc and Co.  
Metal behavior and concentrations during the present exp eriment and observed in the 45 m3 RAS 
indicate that accumulation of Fe and Cu is neglectable, however for Zn, Co and Mn accumulation in 
marine RAS can be expected. This is also reflected in the bioaccumulation of metals during the 
present study. Based on l iterature data, differences between lowest observed LC -50 values for zinc and 
concentrations observed in RAS only vary a factor 40, whereas differences in LOEC and in the RAS 
for both Mn and Co vary a factor 1000. Concentrations in the feed are a factor 10 0 higher for Mn 
compared to Co. Therefore we estimate the potential risk for negative effects on fish production in 
marine RAS, and is ranked as Zn>Mn>Co>Cu>Fe.

5. Conclusion  
 
Although the present experiment lasted only nine weeks, and the full grow out period for turbot is 2 
years we did not see any negative eff ects on growth performance or health. Significant 
bioaccumulation of Zn, Mn and Co and significantly decreasing dry matter content of whole fish took 
place during these 9 weeks of exposure. Concentrations of Zinc in the culture water may become 
problematic  as a result of excess levels of zinc in the diet and zinc concentrations in makeup water. 
However based on the absence of growth and health effects under extreme low water exchange rates, 
we don’t consider metal accumulation as a factor limiting intensifi cation of RAS turbot production.

 Abstract  
  
Hydroxyl radical production with Boron doped diamond (BDD) electrodes might be a promising 
alternative to ozonation of the culture water in marine recirculating aquacultur e systems (RAS) but the 
formation of toxic total residual oxidants (TRO) might limit applications and doses. Data available for 
marine (aquaculture) water are scarce and are limited to laboratory studies, exceeding TRO safety 
levels for fish and shrimp in magnitudes.  
To evaluate the effect of BDD electrodes on water quality and bacterial load, a BDD electrolyzation 
treatment, an ozone treatment (injection of air/ozone mixture) and a control treatment were performed 
in 12 identical 300l marine RAS, arranged  in triplicate experimental design. These RAS were stocked 
with juvenile white leg shrimp ( Litopenaeus vannamei ) and cultured for 30 days fed restricted 
amounts of feed. Dosage of tested oxidation processes were standardized at a TRO safety level of ≤ 
0.06 mg/l Cl2. 
After 30 days no significant differences in mortality, growth and feed efficiencies between treatments 
were found. Accumulation of total organic carbon (TOC), ortho -P and colored dissolved organic 
matter (CDOM) were significantly lower in the BD D-treated RAS compared to control RAS, but no 
significant effects on ammonia or nitrate levels were observed. Nitrite oxidation followed a first -order 
kinetic but overall effect was neglectable compared to biofiltration. Bacterial disinfection was low and 
no changes in bacterial density in the culture tanks were observed. Rapid build -up of lime -stone was 
observed at the cathodic side of the electrodes, changing the actual current density of the electrodes. 
Ozone oxidized significantly more TOC compared to B DD treatment, but did significantly increase 
ortho -P levels but decreased bacterial counts in the culture tank.  
We conclude that safe removal of TOC, CDOM and ortho -P in marine RAS using BDD -electrodes is 
possible to maintain system water quality and to de crease nutrient emissions. The formation of 
limestone has to be avoided to maintain current densities. For disinfection purposes the present BDD -
treatment is less effective than ozone, probably caused by the low contact area between water and 
oxidant due t o short half -life time of hydroxyl radicals.

 1. Introduction  
 
Over the last decades, fish and shrimp production in land based recirculating aquaculture systems 
(RAS) has become increasingly important in the aquaculture industry. To reduce water consumpti on in 
RAS, water re -use and stocking density are intensified (Martins et al. 2010). This leads to an increase 
in the applied feed load per water volume. Consequently waste products originated from feed 
accumulate in the recirculating water requiring techni cal improvements of water treatment 
(Blancheton et al, 2007). Water treatment in RAS consists in general of mechanical (e.g. filtration, 
sedimentation, foam fractionation) and biological (e.g. nitrification, denitrification) treatment 
processes. Because bi ological denitrification and phosphate removal are not common praxis in 
commercial RAS and several dissolved organics are non -biodegradable, nitrate, phosphate and total 
organic carbon accumulate in RAS with high levels of water re -use (Barak and van Rijn,  2000, 
Martins et al, 2010). Furthermore  particles , originating from feed or faeces, are broken down in size 
due to pump sharing making effective mechanical removal using sedimentation or filtration difficult. 
Therefore, physic -chemical treatment processes  such as a combination of UV -light and ozonation are 
widely used not only for disinfection purposes but also to improve water quality by removing feed 
originated accumulating substances from the culture water (Summerfelt and Hochheimer, 1997) . In 
marine R AS ozonation is widely used and has been proven effective in removal of small particles, 
yellow substances, and nitrite  as well as in reducing bacterial numbers (Schroeder et al., 2011). 
Oxidation of ammonia in seawater by ozone via breakpoint bromination is also possible. However this 
process requires the previous formation of toxic brominated ozone -produced oxidants (OPO) as 
intermediates and is thus considered as unsafe and not practical for aquaculture purposes (Schroeder et 
al., 2011). Elevated OPO lev els in the culture water cause stress, diseases and increased mortality to 
shrimp ( Litopenaeus vannamei ), and first signs of histological alterations could have been already 
observed at levels as low as > 0.06 mg/l chlorine (Cl 2) equivalent (Schroeder et a l., 2010). Therefore, 
dosage of ozone is limited to formation and degradation of these OPO. Applied doses in aquaculture 
praxis are commonly between 13 -25 g O 3 per kg feed applied (Summerfelt and Hochheimer, 1997, 
Timmons and Ebeling, 2010).    
Due to econo mic constraints and the risk of forming toxic residual oxidants, alternatives for ozonation 
are searched, and electrolysis of seawater with electrodes producing hydroxyl radicals is recently 
getting more attention. The use of hydroxyl radicals might have e conomic benefits over ozone, 
because no additional oxygen is needed to produce hydroxyl radicals, while water is still enriched with 
oxygen (Mook et al., 2010). Secondly hydroxyl radicals are produced in situ  while ozone is produced 
outside the system wate r and has to be dissolved, resulting in losses (Timmons and Ebeling, 2010). 
Another benefit of hydroxyl radicals is their higher ability to oxidize persistent organic pollutants 
(Mehmet and Brillas, 2007) which might be a way to reduce off -flavour problems  in RAS. A new 
method to produce hydroxyl radicals is electrolysation of water with BDD -electrodes (Marselli et al., 65 
 2003). Boron Doped Diamond (BDD) -electrodes are metallic carriers whereon a thin polycrystalline 
layer of diamonds is deposited by using a technique called chemical vapor deposition. A controlled 
incorporation of impurities, in this case Boron, leads to a highly conductive Boron doped diamond 
(BDD) -electrode with the unique properties of diamond, such as hardness, thermal conductivity and 
chemical inertness (Ivandini et al, 2005). The surface of the electrodes is hydrophobic and not 
attractive for absorption. Due to these characteristics, over a very wide potential range little 
electrochemical activity is observed at the diamond electrode sur face. One result is that, when a 
current is applied on a BDD -electrode in an aqueous medium, the rate of water electrolysis generating 
O2 is negligible and a very high overvoltage can be applied. Due to this high overvoltage, hydroxyl 
radicals can be elect ro-generated (Martin et al., 2005). The formation of hydroxyl radicals can be 
described according to the equation:  
H2O  HO● + H+ + e- 
With an oxidation potential of 2.8 V, the produced hydroxyl radicals have the highest oxidation 
potential compared to other known oxidants used for aquaculture purposes.  In laboratory scale BDD -
electrodes have been used to remove total ammonia  nitrogen, nitrite and chemical oxygen demand 
from saline aquaculture water, and BDD -electrodes have been proposed as alternative to biofiltration 
(Diaz et al., 2010). However flow rates used by Diaz et al. (2010) were 100 -200 times higher than 
optimal flo w rates suggested for RAS (Timmons and Ebeling, 2010) and concentration of toxic free 
chlorine exceeded safety levels for fish and shrimp health over 100 times (Schroeder et al, 2010, 
Reiser et al., 2010) making this system design practically impossible as  alternative to biofiltration.  
The formation of toxic TRO is the main problem when oxidation processes are used in aquaculture 
system water. Due to the high reactivity of hydroxyl radicals different secondary oxidants might be 
formed, depending on the char acteristics and composition of the treated water. In pure water, only 
reactive oxygen species consisting of hydrogen or oxygen atoms are formed such as O●, O 3 and H 2O2. 
These secondary oxidants are also highly reactive and therefore contribute effectively to the water 
treatment. In water containing other ions different intermediates and by -products are formed. 
Especially in saltwater, halogen -ions are oxid ized to secondary oxidants. Some examples of BDD -
produced oxidants in marine and brackish waters are hypohalides (e.g. hypobromite and hypochlorite), 
haloamines (e.g. bromamines and chloramines), trihalomethanes such as chloroform and bromoform, 
halo-aceti c acids and oxoanions such as bromate, chlorate and perchlorate (Eckhardt et al. 2010, Diaz 
et al. 2011). Due to their stability some of these oxidants might accumulate in the culture water to high 
concentrations and represent a high risk for health and we lfare of cultivated species.  
Until now all previous studies conducted with BDD -electrodes are short -term laboratory studies, with 
only very small water volumes mostly around one liter, optimal treatment conditions such as new and 
perfectly clean electrode s, and most important, not biological dynamic systems, including fish, 
bacteria and daily feed inputs, but static chemical test solutions. Furthermore, in previous studies the 
effectivity of BDD -electrodes for water treatment has been rarely set into relat ion to the formation of 66 
 toxic total residual oxidants (TRO). But particularly with regard to aquaculture production TRO 
formation is highly relevant and has to be minimized to avoid deleterious impacts on animal health.  
The aim of the present study was to  evaluate electrochemical water treatment with hydroxyl -radicals 
based on BDD -electrodes for its suitability in marine recirculation aquaculture in comparison with the 
conventional ozonation. Therefore, potential for minimization of TRO was investigated in  preliminary 
experiments and the effect of BDD -produced hydroxyl -radicals on feed originated accumulating 
substances as well as on bacterial load was studied in a long -term experiment, culturing Pacific white 
shrimp ( L. vannamei ) over a period of 30 days. Performance of BDD -electrodes were directly 
compar ed with conventional ozonation, based on a set safety level of TRO ≤ 0.06 mg/l Cl2  equivalent, 
considering water treatment efficiency, shrimp performance and economical aspects.        
 
2. Material & Methods  
 
The whole experiment consisted of three experi ments. The first series of experiments (flow through 
experiments) were carried out to find relations between charge input and the formation of residual 
oxidants and conversion of nitrogen species. The second series of experiments (accumulation 
experiments)  were carried out to see accumulation characteristics of residual oxidants. With 
knowledge obtained from the first two series of experiments a long term study (shrimp culture 
experiment) was carried out to safely culture shrimp for 30 days and treat the wa ter using BDD -
electrodes or conventional ozone.  
 
2.1 System setup  
 
2.1.1 Electrodes and electro cell set up  
 
The electro cell used in this experiment was type CONDIACELL® CP450 salt water  (CONDIAS 
GmbH, Itzehoe, Germany) equipped with 4 pair of electrodes consisting of a Niobium carrier material 
and a 20 µm thick Boron doped diamond layer, type DIACHEM® 24*50 mm (CONDIAS GmbH, 
Itzehoe, Germany). E lectrodes were once weekly cleaned with water and acid (1 molar HCL).  
 
     
2.1.2 RAS set up  
 
The experiments we re conducted in 12 small scaled experimental RAS, each with a system set -up as 
shown in figure 1: With a total water volume of 300 l, RAS consisted of a 275 l rectangular rearing 
tank (1) with a footprint of 0.7 m² (Spranger Kunststoff, Plauen, Germany). W ater from the tank was 
mechanically filtered by filter mats (2). After mechanical filtration water went through the pump (3) 67 
 and the water flow of 1500 l /h was then divided into three flows, with a flow rate of 500 l /h each. The 
first flow went into a prot ein skimmer (4) (Model 1 AH 1100, Erwin Sander, Uetze -Eltze, Germany) 
using compressed air. Water level in the protein skimmer was lowered to avoid foam removal. 
Therefore, the protein skimmer functioned only as degassing and aeration tower. The second flo w 
went into a moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) (5) with a total volume of 30 l, filled with 5 l of 15 
months old biocarriers originating from a MBBR of a pilot RAS (water exchange rate 800 l/kg feed) 
culturing European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax ). The third flow went through the electro cell (6) 
and directly back into the culture tank.  All flow rates were set equal in all RAS. T hese flow rates were 
chosen because 500 l/h was the minimum flow rate for the BDD electro -cell used, suggested by the 
producer (Condias instruction manual). The flow rate of 500 l/h provided exactly a hydraulic retention 
time (HRT) of 1 min in the aeration tower which is an adequate contact time for disinfection 
(Timmons and Ebeling, 2010) and a HRT of 3.6 min in the MBBR.  
Option ally ozone was produced in an ozone -generator (Aquamedic 200 mg/h, Germany) using 
compressed air and was injected at the bottom of the aeration tower (fig. 1.4) by a wooden air -stone 
diffuser in counter current.  
Optional addition of hydroxyl radicals took  place in the reaction chamber (fig.1.6) by electrolyzing the 
passing water with BDD -electrodes as described in 2.1.1 . The electric current required for 
electrolyzation was generated by a laboratory power supply (model EA -PS 3032 -05 B, HEIDE power 
GmbH, Pü rgen, Germany). In order to measure and compare the energy consumption (kWh) of 
electrochemical treatment and ozonation, an electricity meter was mounted prior to the laboratory 
power supply and the ozone generator, respectively. The applied potential (V) and current (A) on the 
BDD -electrodes were recorded by hand.  
 
 
2.2 Experimental set up and procedure  
 
2.2.1 Flow through experiment  
 
During the flow through experiments only one of the 12 experimental RAS was used. RAS was filled 
with bulk water (table 1 ). RAS was operated as described above except that the flow through the 
electro -cell (6) was not send back into the rearing tank but was discarded. TAN, NO 2-N, TRO and 
oxidation reduction potential (ORP) were sampled in the discarded water.  Applied potent ial and 
current were measured by the laboratory power supply and recorded by hand.  All measurements were 
done in triplicate with replicates in time.  
 
2.2.2 TRO accumulation experiments  
 68 
 For TRO accumulation experiments 3 RAS were filled with bulk water (table 1) and stocked with 
hybrid tilapia ( O. nilotus  x O. mozambicus ), no feed was supplied.  All flow rates were set to 500 l/h 
as described above (system set up 2.1). Applied current on the BDD -electrodes were 0.02, 0.05, 0.10 
and 0.20 A (4.7, 11.6, 23. 3 and 46.5 A/m²). Accumulation of TRO was measured over a period of 24 -
30 hours. After each run, water was renewed with bulk water.

2.2.3 Shrimp culture experiment  
 
The 12 small -scaled RAS (figure 1) were divided in 4 system desi gns with 3 replicates each, providing 
3 different treatments by chemical oxidation and a control without oxidation process:  
 Control (I):  filter mats, MBBR, aeration tower.  
 OH (II):  equal to control + continuously  applied current on BDD -electrodes.  
 O3 (III):  equal to control + continues ozone addition  
 OH batch (IV): equal to control+ intermittently applied current on BDD -electrodes  
 
In order to ensure comparability of treatment (II) and (III), dosages of hydroxyl radicals and ozone 
were standardized with r egard to residual oxidant concentration in the tanks. Therefore, the TRO 
concentration was measured at the tank inflow (fig 1., (7)), in regular time intervals and adjusted to a 69 
 value of ≤ 0.06 mg Cl 2 l-1 by regulating the current applied for the generatio n of OH -radicals and 
ozone, respectively. To enable comparison of treatment (II) and (IV) continuous and intermitted 
electrolysation were standardized on the same amount of charge (Ah) used. Therefore, in treatment 
(IV) BDD -electrodes were switched on only  twice a day for a period of 1 HRT each. The experimental 
period consisted of 30 days. Treatment IV was terminated after 14 days because shrimp reacted stress -
full on movement and stopped feeding.  
The performance of BDD -electrodes applied in two different  treatments as well as ozonation were 
evaluated by determining the accumulation of inorganic (TAN, NO 2-N, NO 3-N, ortho -P) and organic 
(TOC and CDOM) substances, the disinfection potential as well as energy consumption. Furthermore, 
bacterial pressure of Vibrio sp.  and total bacteria was estimated in the culture tanks and shrimp 
performance was assessed based on growth rate, feed utilization and mortality.  
RAS were filled with a mixture of water from the seabass pilot -RAS and tab water (detailed 
description of the water matrix is given in table 4). A total of 1200 juvenile Pacific white shrimp 
(Litopenaeus vannamei ) with a mean average weight (±SD) of 2.5  ± 1.3g (range: 1.0 -5.0 g) were 
randomly divided in groups of 100 individuals and distributed to the 12 RA S. Average total wet 
weight per system was 253.3  ± 22. 2 g resulting in an initial density of 362 g/m². Temperature was 
automatically adjusted to 28°C with a temperature -controlled 500 W heater (Aqua Medic, Bissendorf, 
Germany). A photoperiod of 14 h light (06:00 -20:00) - 10 h dark was provided.  Shrimp were fed by 
hand with a commercial shrimp feed (Penaeus grower 3 mm, Le gouessant, France).  Feed load was 
restricted, resulting in equal amounts of feed for every tank. Feeding regime was 3 times a day, 7 days 
per week . Feed load within day 1 -14 was 15 g per day, within day 15 -28 25 g per day. No feed was 
fed at day 0 and 29. T ab water was added to compensate for evaporation losses and sand -filtered, 
ozonized and UV -treated seawater was used to compensate for cl eaning losses.

 2.3 Water quality analysis  
 
TP and O -P were measured spectrophotometrically with the ascorbic acid method using a microplate 
reader Infinite 200 (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland) according to the protocols of Grasshoff et al. 
(1999 ) and adapted to microplate format. TAN, NO 2-N, NO 3-N, Fe and TRO were determined 
spectrophotometrically using a HACH -DR 2800 spectrophotometer (Hach -Lange GmbH, Berlin, 
Germany) and powder pillow detection kits (Hach -Lange GmbH, Berlin, Germany) based on the 
ammonia salicylate method, diazotization method,  the cadmium reduction method, 1,10 Phenantrolin 
method  and the N,N-diethyl -p-phenylenediamine (DPD) method,  respectively. TRO is measured in 
mmol/l but notated during the present study as chlorine  (Cl 2) equivalents in mg/l. TOC was analyzed 
as non purgable organic carbon using a total organic carbon analyzer TOC -V CPH/CPN (Shimadzu 
corp., Kyoto, Japan). Total alkalinity was calculated by pH change using titration method with 
hypochloric acid adapted from Grasshoff et al. (1983). Temperature and pH were measured with a 
WTW 340i portable multiparameter instrument (WTW GmbH, Weilheim, Germany), salinity with a 
digital refractometer  HI 96822 (HANNA Instruments, Woonsocket, USA)  and dissolved oxygen with 
a Hand y Polaris oxygen probe (Oxygard International A/S, Birkenrød, Denmark). Dissolved colored 
organic matter (CDOM) was determined by direct absorption at 436 nm of pre -filtered (0,22 µm) 
culture water and compared against a blank of artificial sea water (ASW)  at 20 g /l Cl-. Absorption was 
measured with a microplate reader Infinite 200 (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland). A BMT ozone 
analyser 963 (BMT Messtechnik GmbH, Berlin, Germany) was used to determine ozone addition by 
measuring flow rate and ozone concentrat ion in the gas stream.  
 
2.4 Microbial analysis  
 
Within the shrimp culture experiment water samples were taken from the tanks (fig.1, (1)) of all 
treatments and the control for the estimation of bacterial density. Furthermore, water samples at the 
inflow and the outflow of both tested chemical water treatment processes, ozonation (treatment 2) (fig. 
1 (4)) and BDD electrolysation (treatment 3 and 4) (fig. (6)) were taken to assess bactericidal 
efficiencies. Samples were taken one by one. Directly after eac h sample was taken, the respective 
sample was diluted and analyzed  by the spread plate method using an unspecific marine agar (Difco 
Marine Agar, BD, Sparks, USA) for the detection of total viable cell counts, as well as a Vibrio sp.  
specific agar (Difco T CBS Agar, BD, Sparks, USA) for the detection of Vibrios. Colony forming units 
per plate were recorded after 24 and 96 h of incubation at 28° C on marine agar (T -CFU /ml) and on 
Vibrio sp . specific agar (V -CFU /ml).   
 
2.5 Assumptions and formulas  
 71 
  
Current density (CD) was calculated as follows:  
 
CD = Applied current (A) / working surface electrode      (1) 
 
Working surface electrode (WSE) was calculated as follows  
 
WSE = (length (m) * width electrode (m)) * active area electrode * surface factor  (2) 
 
where the perpendicular cross section of 1 electrode is 75*32 mm. Active area is the fraction of the 
electrodes functioning as cathode (or anode), depending on the three dimensional arrangement of the 
electrodes pair which determines if an electrode is active on  one or both sides. Number of active area 
in our case was 7. The surface factor is a correction for the roughness of the diamond surface and a 
correction for the fact that a mesh is used, not a plate. The surface factor used here is 1.2. Thus value 
used fo r WSE is 75*32*7*1.2= 20160 mm² or 0.020160 m².  
For the ease of understanding and calculations we assume that only hydroxyl radicals are generated at 
the electrodes as primary product according to equation (3), resulting in equation (4).  
 
H2O  HO● + H+ + e-         (3)  
 
1 mole e- = 1 mole OH●         (4) 
1 Faraday = charge of one mole e-       (5) 
1 Faraday = 96485.3399 C         (6) 
1 C = 1 A*s           (7) 
 
When oxidized or produced substances are plotted against Faraday, the mole OH● equivalent , the 
current efficiency can be estimated.  
 
Current efficiency = substance X (mole) / OH● (mole) or Faraday                                     (8)  
 
For ozone, molar  efficiencies can be calculated in the same way                      
 
Molar  efficiency  = substance X (mole) / O 3 (mole)                                                            (9) 
  
To compare the accumulation of substances in the culture water the function cumulative feed burden 
(CFB) is used. This function is combining the amount of feed ad ded per volume of water, corrected 
for water exchange and is calculated as follow:  72 
  
CFB = Feed added (g) / V total (l) ^ ( -V/V total)       (10) 
 
where “feed added” is the amount of feed added per tank in g, “V total“ is the total culture volume and 
“–V” is the amount of water replaced.  
 
As CFB was set to 0 at the start of the experiment although the initial process water matrix was not 
free of accumulating substances, accumulating water parameters (NO 3-N, OP, TP, TOC and dissolved 
matter)  are both presente d as absolute value and as increase of the parameter:  
 
F(x) = mx + b           (11) 
 
where x is the cumulative feed burden, F(x) is the accumulation of the water parameter and b is the 
consumption or production of the parameter at a CFB = 0.  
 
Reduction ef ficiency for disinfection was calculated as the difference in CFU between inflow and 
outflow  
 
RE = (CFU inflow – CFU outflow  / CFU inflow)*100       (12) 
 
Reduction factor was calculated as the logarithmic difference between CFU in inflow and outflow  
 
RF = log (CFU inflow) – log(CFU outflow )       (13) 
 
2.6 Data analysis  
 
Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) of n samples. Statistical analysis of variances 
was performed using SPSS 17.0 (IBM inc, Armonk, USA). Linear regression was conducted using 
Graphpad (Graphpad software inc., La Jolla, USA ). Data were tested for normality and for equal 
variances (p<0.05) using Levene’s test and the Kolgomorov -Smirnov test, respectively. Multiple 
comparisons were carried out by the parametric Tukey’s HSD or the no n-parametric Dunnet’s T3 test. 
Single comparisons were carried out by paired or unpaired t -tests. Differences were considered as 
significant at p<0.05.

 3. Results  
 
3.1 Flow through experiments  
 
The minimum potential needed to produce hydroxyl radicals was 2.4 V. The applied current density 
(A/m²) showed a positive logarithmic relation with potential needed (V) according to the formula:  
 
Potential needed (V) = 0.399 ln (CD) + 2.1906 (r² = 0.972)     (14) 
 
where CD is current density in A/m² and minimum po tential needed is 2.4 V.  
 
ORP decreased with increasing current density (figure 2b), an increased change of ORP was observed 
between 12 and 32 A/m2 with a maximum change at 22 A/m² when the first derivate of ORP was 
plotted (figure 2d).  
 
TRO production sh owed a positive relation with the applied current density (figure 2), and thus with 
the amount of hydroxyl radicals produced, if linear regressed according to the formula:  
 
TRO (mg Cl 2/l) = 5.46 *10-3 * CD (r² = 0.970)       (15) 
TRO (mole) = 0.044 * OH● (mole) (r² = 0.970)       (16) 
 
The residual plot showed a non -normal distribution, where negative values (residuals) were found at a 
current density of <27 A/m² with lowest residuals for TRO production at 17 A/m² (figure 2 c).  
 
Maximum current efficiency fo r TRO production was 0.05 observed at a current density of 42 A/m² 
(figure 3).

Total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) was not affected by current density in the tested range. Nitrite 
reduction showed a positive linear r elation with current density. Nitrite concentration, respectively 
nitrite oxidation could be described according to the formulas:  
 
NO 2-N (mg/l) = -9.53 10-4 * CD + 0.65  (r²=0.987)      (17) 
NO 2-N oxidized (mole) = 0.0639 * OH (mole)  (r²=0.987)     (18) 
 
Where CD is current density in A/m² and initial NO 2-N concentration was 0.65 mg/l. 
   
 
3.2 TRO accumulation experiments  
 
Results of the flow through experiments showed that a current density of 10.0 A/m² yielded a TRO 
concentration of 0.06 mg/l Cl2 (figure 2 ). Therefore different current densities (1.8, 2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 
A/m² ) were applied and TRO ± SE was measured over a time period of 24 -30 hand reached a plateau 
at 0.42 ± 0.02 (n = 15, r² = 0.96), 0.20 ± 0.02 (n = 21, r² = 0.94), 0.12 ± 0.00 (n = 42, r² = 0.98) and 
0.06 ± 0.00 (n = 18, r² = 0.94) respectively (figure 4).

 3.3 Shrimp culture experiment  
 
3.3.1 Shrimp performance  
 
Shrimp feeding behavior was affected in treatment  IV (intermittent BDD treatment) and thus was 
terminated after two weeks because shrimp were stresse d and stopped feeding and thus biased water 
quality parameters. Therefore data are included for disinfection performance, but not for other 
parameters. For other treatments s hrimp performance in terms of mortality, growth and feed utilization 
did not signi ficantly vary between treatments (table 2).

3.3.2 Addition of oxidants and total residual oxidants in the water  
 
Average TRO values in all tanks were managed to keep at ≤ 0.06 mg/l Cl2, no significant differences 
between tanks or treatments (ta ble 3) were observed. To maintain desired TRO values in the BDD 
treatment applied current on the electrodes varied between 0.01 and 0.04 (A) (0.5 – 2.0 A/m²).  
Although TRO values were measured and regulated intensively, high variation within days and 
betwe en days was observed in both ozone and BDD treatment. Peak values did regularly exceed the 
maximum of 0.06 mg/l Cl2 and varied between 0.00 -0.16 mg/l Cl2 for treatment II (OH●) and between 
0.00-0.11 mg/l Cl2 for treatment III (O 3). The occurrence of TRO values above the safety level of 0.06 
mg/l Cl2 was significantly higher for treatment (II) OH● compared with treatment (III) O 3. Although 
not significant, the trend in all tank s was that oxidant addition per day with respect to TRO safety 
levels, increased with feed load per day, suggesting that TRO breakdown in the tank is dependent on 
feed gift. Ozone addition was measured but due to analytical limitations values are given as maximum 
values to assure that no overestimations are made. Total energy consumption was significantly higher 
for treatment (II) compared to treatment (III).

3.3.3 Water quality parameters  
 
Temperature and salinity were regulated and thus did not vary between treatments. pH and total 
alkalinity decrea sed over the experimental period as a result of the nitrification process but did not 
vary between treatments. Total amm onia nitrogen (TAN) and nitrite fluctuate d within and between 
days, no accumulation took place and thus average concentrations over the experimental period were 
compared. No significant differences between treatments were observed (table 4).

3.3.4 Effect of treatment on  accumulating substances  
  
NO 3-N, ortho -P, TOC and absorbance (436 nm) did significantly (p>0.000) accumulate in the control 
groups and showed high correlation with the CFB (figure 5) and therefore they were considered inert 
and thus effect of treatments c ould be found comparing slopes using ordinary least squares (OLS).  
Nitrate showed significant accumulation in all treatments and showed high correlation with CFB but 
no significant effect of treatment on nitrate accumulation was found (table 5).  
Ortho -P showed significant accumulation in all treatments, and significant differences between 
treatments were observed (figure 5). Accumulation in the hydroxyl radicals treatment (II) was 
significantly lower  (p = 0.038)  than control, accumulation of ortho -P in oz one treatment was 
significantly higher than in control (p = 0.000).  TOC showed significant accumulation in all 79 
 treatments, and significant differences between treatments were observed (figure 5). Accumulation in 
the hydroxyl radicals (II) and ozone (III) treatments were significantly lower (p = 0.038 and p = 0.000) 
than control, and accumulation in ozone treatments was significantly lower than in hydroxyl treatment 
(p = 0.037).  
CDOM did accumulate in the control groups, but not in both treatments. Therefo re accumulation was 
significantly higher in control compared to hydroxyl radicals and ozone treatments (p = 0.000 and p = 
0.000) but did not significantly vary between treatments (p = 0.097).

3.3.5 Disinfection performance  
 
All disinfection treatments, (II) (III) and (IV) showed signific ant lower vibrio  counts at the outflow of 
the respective disinfection unit compared to the inflow, no significant differences between treatments 
were observed. For total bacteria counts no significant disinfection was found for continuous hydroxyl 
(II) tre atment, whereas ozone and intermittent treatment showed significant lower bacterial counts at 
the outflow (table 5).

3.3 Effect of treatment on bacterial pressure  
 
Although very high deviations within treatments were observed for control and BDD treatment figure 
3 shows clearly that total bact erial pressure in the culture tank was lower for the ozone treatments 
compared to control and hydroxyl treatment. Although significant reduction for Vibrio  sp. was 
observed after addition of oxidants (table 5), no effect of treatment on Vibrio  sp. pressure  in the 
culture tanks was observed (figure 6).

 3.7 Electrodes perform ance, maintenance and status  
 
The relation between current (A) and potential (V) did not change during the 30 days of the 
experiment. This indicates that performance of the BDD -electrodes did not decrease during the 
experiment. Although the performance di d not measurable decrease, electrodes built up a film of 
limestone between electrode -pairs.  
 
4. Discussion  
 
4.1 Total residual oxidant formation on BDD -electrodes and implications for RAS  
 
Oxidation of saline water, containing halogen ions like Cl- and Br-, with hydroxyl radicals leads to 
formation of mono - di and tri - forms of chlorine and bromine species (Bergmann and Rollin 2007, 
Echardt and Kornmueller 2009).  The reactive forms can be measured with the DPD method and the 
sum of the reactive oxidants is  called total residual oxidants (TRO). TRO are known to be very toxic 
to shrimp and fish. Concentrations as low as 0.1 mg/l Cl2 significantly decrease survival of shrimp ( L. 
vannamei ) at chronic exposure and 0.06 mg/l Cl2 was given as safety value (Schroed er et al. 2010) 
although more sensitive parameters such as feed intake and growth performance were not considered. 
When saline water also contains ammonia and organics, such as RAS system water, chlor - and brom -
amines, chlor - and bromo -acetic acids, bromat e, chlorate, perchlorate and chloroform and bromoform 
are other main formation products (Echardt and Kornmueller 2009, Diaz et al 2011). Due to their 
lower reactivity bromate, chlorate and bromoform accumulate at much higher levels than other species 
(Echa rdt and Kornmueller 2009) but these oxidants are not detected and measured by the DPD -method 
used in this study. LC -50 values of bromoform to marine fish ( Brevoortia tyrannus) and shrimp  
(Penaeus aztecus) were found at 10 mg/l and 26 mg/l respectively. How ever sublethal effect revealing 
stress, such as unselective rapid swimming and hitting the walls, were already observed for 
concentration of 0.4 mg/l bromoform, indicating that stress already occurs at low concentrations 
(Gibson et al. 1979).  
Considering the extreme toxicity of reactive oxidants and the stress reaction of shrimp to stable 
accumulating oxidants the prevention or minimization of TRO formation should be the key point in 
BDD -treatment of aquaculture water. In the present research formation of TRO was dependent on 
current density with lower TRO values than one can expect when linearity is assumed, at current 
densities below 27 A/m² (figure 1). Minimum TRO formation was found at 17 A/m² whereas 
maximum change in ORP was found at 22 A/m². These bo th indicates that at a current density of 17 -
22 A/m² larger molecules or particles are oxidized to smaller fractions, reducing TRO formation and 
lowering ORP. Lowest current efficiencies for TRO formation, which are desired due to toxicity of 
TRO, were obs erved at lowest current densities applied with current efficiencies close to 0 (figure 2). 82 
 Even using such low current densities, TRO did accumulate (figure 3) limiting the applied doses. 
During the present research TRO levels for ozone treatments were 0.0 4 ± 0.02 mg/l Cl2 and 0.06 ± 
0.02 mg/l Cl2 for BDD -treatment. No significant differences in growth or feed efficiency were 
observed, however one has to consider that the present experimental design is not optimal for testing 
growth and production performan ce. Trends in growth and feed efficiency showed lower values for 
BDD -treatments compared to control and ozone treatments, although not significant. However one can 
assume that, when experimental period would be longer effects would be more pronounced and a n 
average TRO value of 0.06 might be too high for an optimal shrimp culture performance. Further 
research is needed to quantify safe TRO concentrations for commercial aquaculture with respect to 
feed intake and feed utilization efficiency. When BDD -electro cell treatment is up -scaled to 
commercial size marine RAS, current densities should be kept as low as possible to minimize TRO 
formation. Furthermore optimization of hydrodynamics in the electrocell, a turbulent flow instead of a 
laminar flow, might optimi ze performance of the electrocell.  
 
4.2 Inorganic nitrogen accumulation and conversion on BDD -electrodes in RAS  
 
Continues increased levels of TAN, NO 2-N or NO 3-N all decrease fish and shrimp production 
performance (Colt, 1996). The conversion of TAN to N 2 and NO 3 to N 2 are processes that remove 
nitrogen from the culture water, and therefore might improve production in RAS. Several authors have 
studied the behavior of inorganic forms of nitrogen in waste water after elect rolysation with BDD -
electrodes (Kraf t 2003 , Georgaud et al. 2011, Levy -Clement 2005,  Bergmann and Rollin 2007, 
Michels et al. 2010). A simplified summary of processes observed by these authors is:    
 
N2← TAN↔NO 2 ↔NO 3 →N 2 
 
Both oxidation of TAN and reduction of NO 3 have the advantage that N 2 is formed and nitrogen is 
removed from the culture water. Disadvantages of the oxidation of TAN to N 2 is the requirement of 
high, fish and shrimp toxic levels of TRO, formation of several chlorine, bromine and THM species 
(Diaz et al. 2010), the formation  of chloramines (Bergmann and Rollin 2007) and formation of the 
byproducts NO 2 and NO 3 (Kraft, 2003). Furthermore TAN oxidation is inhibited by nitrite and yellow 
substances, decreasing its efficiency and suitability for aquaculture waste water (Diaz et al ., 2010, 
Schroeder et al. 2011) and thus is considered risky and economic unviable for marine RAS purposes 
(Schroeder et al., 2011).  Disadvantages of the cathodic reduction of NO 3 to N 2 is the formation of 
byproducts TAN and NO 2 and chloramines and that t he reduction process is slow (Levy -Clement 
2005). Due to this slow cathodic reduction process, at the anodic side TRO are formed, facing the 
same disadvantages as by TAN oxidation. Therefore authors suggest cathodic reduction of nitrate only 
an option by h ighly concentrated or toxic waste waters until biological treatment is possible (Levy -83 
 clement 2005, Georgaud et al. 2011). In the present study no effect on nitrogen accumulation was 
found, only oxidation of nitrite -N was found but the effect was low compa red to biofiltration. 
Opportunities for anodic conversion of nitrate to nitrogen gas in marine RAS water needs further 
research.  
 
4.3 Organic carbon accumulation and conversion on BDD electrodes in RAS  
 
Total organic carbon in RAS originates from feed but  carbon species present in the water are diverse. 
Generally TOC is divided in a particulate and a dissolved organic fraction. The particulate fraction can 
be removed by mechanical filtration but removal efficiency is dependent on densities and size. Due to  
pump sharing solids are decreased in size and fine solids accumulate in RAS and the accumulation of 
fine solids can affects health of cultured animals. Furthermore TOC is the limiting nutrient for the 
growth of heterotrophic bacteria in RAS, and thus by r educing TOC the total amount of heterotrophic 
bacteria can be reduced. If chemical removal of TOC leads to a reduced pathogenic bacterial load is 
questionable, because a reduced system HRT or increased disinfection performance leads to less stable 
and more  pathogenic bacterial communities (Schneider et al., 2007, Attramadal et al., 2012). The 
dissolved carbon fraction consists of humic acids which accumulate in RAS. Effects of humic acids on 
fish growth are not known, however humic acids might promote healt h and reduce stress in fish raised 
in RAS (Meinelt et al. 2008). The chemical removal of TOC in RAS is thus still questionable. D uring 
the present research significant removal of TOC and CDOM by hydroxyl radicals was observed. 
Current efficiency for TOC re moval was estimated to be 0.11 (table 6). Other data on removal of TOC 
in aquaculture waste water are not available, however reduction of chemical oxygen demand (COD) in 
aquaculture waste water as a measurement of organic load, was also observed by Diaz et  al. (2010) 
using BDD -electrodes at current densities between 5 and 50 A/m², and by Feng et al (2003) using 
Ti/RuO2 electrodes in pond water. During the present research ozone removed significantly more 
TOC compared to hydroxyl radicals. Molar conversion e fficiency was estimated to be 0.19 and this 
was solely due to chemical oxidization of TOC. Ozone is known for its ability to improve flocculation 
of organic matter and thereby improving mechanical removal in RAS (Summerfelt and Hochheimer, 
1997). Removal e fficiencies of ozone in combination with foam fractionating would likely be higher 
than values obtained  during the present study. Further research is needed to see if BDD -treatment also 
can improve mechanical removal due to flocculation of organic matter a nd if a combination of BDD -
treatment and foam fractionating would be useful.  
 
4.4 Ortho -P accumulation and conversion on BDD -electrodes in RAS  
 
The effect of accumulated ortho -phosphate levels on fish or shrimp performance and health are 
unknown. However,  phosphate is the main factor in eutrophication of coastal areas and thus phosphate 84 
 removal from RAS water, in system or at the end -of-the-pipe, is relevant. Anodic removal of total 
phosphorus with hydroxyl radicals, produced with Ti/RuO2 anodes, is report ed, but reaction 
mechanisms are not described (Feng et al., 2003).  In the present study significant removal of 
orthophosphate was observed in the BDD treatment, although current efficiencies for ortho -phosphate 
removal were very low (table 6). Hydroxyl ra dicals are known to carry out electron transfer with 
HPO 4- and PO 4- to form hydroxide ions and a phosphoric acid ion with a changed valence state 
(Thomas, 1965). A possible pathway of phosphate removal during our study is precipitation of the 
orthophosphat e anion with a cation. Several authors reported the formation of limestone on BDD -
electrodes ( Diamadopoulos et al., 2009). In our study growth of biofilm and limestone (CaCO 3) at the 
BDD -electrodes was observed, and limestone was mechanically or chemically  removed by cleaning of 
electrodes, or removed by re -polarization  of the electrodes and then filtered out of the water by the 
filter mats. Because orthophosphates are absorbed by CaCO 3 in seawater (Millero et al., 2001) it might 
be that the removal of orth ophosphates is due to absorption of orthophosphates on calcium carbonate, 
and then removed by mechanical filtration. Further research is needed to find out reaction mechanisms 
and to optimize phosphate removal by BDD -electrolysation.

4.5 BDD -treatment disinfection in RAS  
 
During the present research a disinfection efficiency of roughly 80% was achieved for total bacteria 
and 90% for Vibrio  sp., during int ermittent disinfection with current densities of 14.8 ± 3.0 A/m² at the 
BDD -electrodes. When hydroxyl radicals were applied at continues safe concentrations at a current 
density of 1.2 ± 0.3 A/m² disinfection efficiency decreased to 0% for total bacteria c ount and 60 % for 85 
 Vibrio  sp. counts. Continues applied ozone resulted in higher disinfection efficiencies, 40% for total 
bacteria counts and 80 % for Vibrio sp.  counts (table 7). Differences between disinfection efficiencies 
between total bacteria and Vibrio species might be explained by the fact that total bacteria are mostly 
particle -aggregated which protects them against oxidants, and Vibrio are free living and thus more 
susceptible (Hess -Erga et al., 2008). Literature values for BDD -disinfection in sali ne water are limited 
to the data set of Echardt and Kornmueller (2009) who achieved a disinfection rate of >97 % for E. 
coli bacteria, unfortunately current densities are not given but TRO levels of 1.4 mg/l Cl2 were 
observed. Therefore achieving significa nt disinfection in RAS culture water using BDD -electrodes 
seems impossible  due to TRO formation. Differences between disinfection efficiency of hydroxyl 
radicals and ozone might be shorter half -life time of hydroxyl radicals in water (Westerhoff et al., 
1999). In RAS water disinfection efficiency is expressed by the factor C*T were C is the concentration 
of oxidants in mg/l and T is the exposure time in minutes. For ozone, applied to ozone demand free 
water, C*T values of 0.01 obtain a 99.9 % disinfection, and in aquaculture effluent or system water 
C*T values of 0.2 – 0.5 are mostly sufficient for a 99.9 % disinfection with exposure time around 1 
minute (Timmons and Ebeling, 2010).  
The bacterial pressure in the culture tanks was not affected by continues tr eatment with hydroxyl 
radical. In both control and hydroxyl radicals total bacterial counts increased with increasing CFB. 
Treatment with ozone resulted in significant lower total bacteria counts in the culture tanks, but not in 
lower Vibrio sp. counts.  H ydroxyl radicals are active disinfectants itself, additionally in marine water 
the secondary formed bromine and chlorine compounds are also active disinfectants (Echardt and 
Kornmueller, 2009). Increased concentrations of residual oxidants do increase disi nfection 
performance by equal current densities suggesting that secondary formed oxidants are more effective 
than hydroxyl radicals itself (Furuta et al. 2005). However during the present research TRO levels 
were on average 50 % higher in the hydroxyl treatments  (0.06±0.02) than in the ozone treatments 
(0.04±0.02). If equal forms of TRO are produced by ozone and hydroxyl radicals, the differences in 
disinfection efficiency can be explained by the difference in half -life time between ozone and 
hydroxyl radic als making ozone a more favorable disinfectant.  
 
5. Conclusions  
 
Electrolyzation of marine RAS water with BDD -electrodes leads to formation of TRO which can 
accumulate in RAS to shrimp toxic levels, limiting the applied doses of hydroxyl radicals. By appl ying 
low current densities (1.2 ± 0.3 A/m²)  significant removal of TOC, CDOM and ortho -P was achieved 
without significantly affecting shrimp growth, feed efficiency and survival. No significant removal of 
nitrate was observed. Disinfection performance at t hese low current densities is very low, therefore no 
effects on bacterial pressure in culture tanks could be observed. Although current was re -poled twice a 
day rapid formation of limestone on BDD -electrodes was observed changing the actual applied current  86 
 density. When formation of limestone can be prevented, BDD -treatment can become a safe way of 
water treatment in marine RAS systems to decrease accumulation of TOC and CDOM, but especially 
to decrease ortho -P accumulation which is not possible using conve ntional ozonation. Further research 
on BDD -electrochemical denitrification in marine RAS is suggested.

 Abstract  
 
The use of Boron Doped Diamond  (BDD) electrodes is a relative new water treatment technique, but 
until now application in  RAS is limited to laboratory or aquarium scaled research.  Therefore, we 
studied the effects of a BDD electro cell, the EctoSys operated at 10 m³/h, in a 45 m³ cold water 
marine RAS on disinfection and water quality. RAS water was treated for 10 days usin g only 
mechanical and biological treatment as control, 10 days with additional ozonation at 5.2 g/ m³/d 
without foam fractionating, and 10 days with additional BDD produced hydroxyl radicals at current 
densities of 14 A/m2 instead of ozonation.  
The accumula tion of nitrates and total phosphorus was not influenced by treatment. The accumulation 
of ortho -phosphate and total organic carbon was significantly reduced by BDD treatment, but not by 
ozonation. The accumulation of colored dissolved organic matter was s ignificantly reduced by BDD 
treatment but even more by ozonation. Metal concentrations did not significantly vary between 
treatments. TRO production by BDD electrodes was lower compared to ozone, but formed oxidants 
were more persistent  resulting in higher  TRO concentrations in the culture tanks. Although in both 
treatments some disinfection was observed no effects of treatment on bacterial densities in the culture 
tanks were observed.  
Results, with respect to organic carbon and orthophosphate removal, are  promising to improve culture 
conditions in RAS system water and to reduce nutrient emissions. Further research on cathodic nitrate 
removal and coupling BDD treatment to mechanical removal methods such as flocculation or foam 
fractionating, to increase rem oval efficiencies of particulate matter, is advised.

 1. Introduction  
 
Aquaculture production in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) offers several benefits over against 
common production systems as pond or cage culture. Benefits include improved cont rol of water 
quality, improved disease management, no risk of escapees, less dependence on surface waters, better 
waste stream management and reduced water consumption (Martins et al. 2010). By recirculating and 
re-use of water, substances originating from  feed or make up water do accumulate in such systems 
which can negatively affect survival, production or fish quality (Davidson et al., 2009, Martins et al. 
2009, Martins et al. 2011, Schrader et al. 2010, van Bussel et al, 2012). These substances include 
ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, phosphate, metals and dissolved and particulate organic matter. Although 
waste streams are treated separately inside the RAS, water exchange is still inevitable. Therefore the 
re-use of water is limited by the system’s ability to  maintain water quality at acceptable levels. Thus 
by improving water treatment in RAS, water consumption per amount of feed applied, or fish 
produced, can be reduced. Consequently energy requirements for water treatment do increase, making 
RAS production,  less favorable compared to common production systems in terms of global warming, 
acidification and land competition (Fitwi et al., 2013). Therefore reducing energy consumption, next 
to water consumption, is a future challenge for RAS development.  
Advanced  oxidation process using Boron Doped Diamond (BDD) electrodes has proven its ability for 
removing ammonia, nitrite, nitrate and COD in saline waste water (Kraft et al., 2003). Furthermore 
treatment with BDD electrodes can be an effective way of disinfectio n in saline water ( Echardt and 
Kornmueller, 2009). Energy consumption of electrolysis is lower compared to ozonation due to low 
energy use by electrodes and no need for additional use of chemicals such as oxygen (Oturan and 
Brillas, 2007). Both disinfectio n and nutrient oxidation are an effect of the direct oxidation by 
hydroxyl radicals or oxidation by formed by -products such as free bromine and chlorine species. In 
fresh water hydroxyl radicals are produced at the anodic side of BDD electrodes according t o 
 
H2O → OH● + H+ + e- 
 
Hydroxyl radicals react very fast, are unselective and extremely short -living. However when marine 
water is electrolyzed with BDD -electrodes simultaneously to hydroxyl radicals, free chlorine is 
formed according to:  
 
2 Cl- → Cl 2 + e- 
 
In marine water chlorine gas is immediately converted into hypochloric acid which further dissociates 
depending on the pH:  
 92 
 Cl2 + H 2O → HCl + HOCl  
HOCl + H 2O ↔ OCl- + H 3O+ 
 
In marine water not only chloride but also bromide is present. The chloride ion in hypochloric acid 
will be substituted with a bromide ion forming the stable hypobromous acid  
 
HOCl + Br- → HOBr + Cl-  
 
(Echardt and Kornmueller, 2009). Next to the simultaneous formation of free chlorine small amounts 
of free bromine are produced:  
  
2 Br- → Br 2 + e- 
 
Like chlorine gas, bromine gas is immediately converted into hypobromous acid which further 
dissociates depending on the pH:  
 
Br2 + H 2O → HBr + HOBr  
HOBr + H 2O ↔ OBr- + H 3O+ 
 
Thus in marine water with pH around 8, hypobromous acid is the do minant residual oxidant formed 
(Kornmueller 2007). Furthermore chlorate, perchlorate and bromate are formed (Bergmann and Rollin 
2007, this thesis chapter 6). When saline water additionally contains organics and ammonia, which is 
inevitable in RAS, organic  chloramines, organic bromamines, chloracetic acid, bromoacetic acids, 
chloroform and bromoform are other main formation products (Bergmann and Rollin 2007, Echardt 
and Kornmueller 2009, Diaz et al 2011).  
With the exception of perchlorate, bromate and chl orate which are relatively non -toxic, all other by -
products are harmful to fish and shrimp causing stress, morphological changes and mortality at 
concentrations less than 0.5 ppm  (Gibson et al., 1979, Hutchinson et al., 1997 Reiser et al. 2010, 
Schroeder e t al. 2010, van Wijk and Hutchinson, 1995). Thus formation of by -products should be 
minimized and accumulation in system water must be avoided.  
Data on the use of BDD electrodes in marine aquaculture water are limited to only two studies. Diaz et 
al. (2010 ) treated marine aquaculture water with BDD electrodes in lab scaled systems and promoted 
BDD -treatment as alternative to biological filtration for the removal of ammonia, nitrite and COD. 
However experiments were carried out in a statical optimal lab envi ronment, not in a dynamic 
biological environment, and flow rates used were 100 -200 times higher than optimal flow rates 
suggested for RAS (Timmons and Ebeling, 2010). Furthermore concentrations of toxic TRO exceeded 
safety levels for fish and shrimp cultur e 100 times, thus even the suggested removal of TRO with 93 
 active carbon is risky, because by possible failure the complete stock will die within minutes. Data 
obtained by Diaz et al. (2010) are therefore useful to obtain basic knowledge about the processes 
taking place in marine RAS water, but are hard to implement in commercial scaled systems.  
A recent study of van Bussel et al. (2013a) showed that water treatment with BDD electrodes in small 
scaled RAS, is possible using low current densities and optimal f low rates, without exceeding TRO 
safety levels and without significant negative effects on shrimp ( Litopeneaus vannamei ) health. In 
addition significant reduced accumulation of TOC, CDOM and ortho -phosphate (ortho -P) could be 
observed.  
Goal of the present study was to see if results obtained in the small scaled RAS (300 l, van Bussel et 
al., 2013a), could also be obtained in a commercial scale RAS. Therefore, in several short term 
experiments the formation of TRO using BDD electrodes and the behavior of the  oxidation reduction 
potential (ORP) in marine RAS culture water was studied. Thus the intensity of water re -use was 
artificially increased over a period of 10 days while water treatment consisted of mechanical and 
biological filtration only, and the accum ulation of substances was monitored. Afterwards this 
procedure was repeated but additionally ozone was added to the culture water, then this procedure was 
repeated a third time but instead of ozone addition water was treated with BDD -electrodes. Next to th e 
accumulation of substances in the culture water, bacterial pressure and disinfection performance was 
monitored. To guarantee fish welfare BDD and ozone treatment intensity were kept below 0.06 mg/l 
Cl2 TRO levels in accordance to  Schroeder et al., 2010)    
 
2. Material & Methods  
 
2.1 System setup  
 
2.1.1 Electrodes and electro cell set up  
 
The electro cell used in this experiment was a prototype ECTOSYS® (RWO GmbH, Bremen, 
Germany) equipped with 3 pair of electrodes consisting of a Niobium carrier material  and a 20 µm 
thick Boron doped diamond layer, type DIACHEM® 100 mm diameter (CONDIAS GmbH, Itzehoe, 
Germany). Flow rate through the electrocell was kept constant at 10 m³/h using an ultrasonic clamp -on 
flow meter (Optisonic 6400, KROHNE Messtechnik GmbH,  Duisburg, Germany).  
   94

2.1.2 RAS  
 
Experiments were conducted in a commercial scale RAS which consisted of 10 cylindrical tanks 
(radius of 1.8 m, 2.3 m³ each) constituting a total volum e of 41 m³. RAS were stocked with 630 adult 
turbot ( Psetta maxima ) in the range of 550 -1800 gram with an initial total biomass of 619 kg. The 
effluent water of the fish tanks is drained via central bottom effluent and a second effluent -close to the 
surface  (Dual -Drain -Design). The bottom effluent is regulated by stand pipes. The effluent water can 
be split into the brush sedimenter (Prototype, Spranger Kunststoff, Germany) with flow rates of 10 
m³/h and the drum filter, with flow rates of 80 m³/h and 60µm p ore size (type KTS8/12, Dryden aqua, 
Scotland).The flow through  the drum filter was led directly into the pump sump, the flow through the 
brush sedimenter was pumped through the ECTOSYS electrocell into the pump sump. Water from the 
pump sump is directed b y three pumps (max. 50 m³/h each) into one of the following circuits: 
fluidized bed filter and back into the pump sump; protein skimmers (10 m³/h, type Helgoland 500, 
Sander skimmers, Germany) or a plate heat exchanger and back into the pump sump or via an  oxygen 
saturator cone back into the fish tanks. Temperature and oxygen were measured and regulated 
automatically. pH, conductivity and water exchange were measured and recorded automatically. 
Optionally ozone was produced by an ozone -generator (Ozone Gene rator C -Lasky, AirTree Ozone 
Technology Co., Taiwan) using liquid oxygen. Foam produced in the protein skimmer was not 
discarded but led back into the pump sump to compare solely the chemical effect of ozone, and not 
95 
 additional the mechanical removal throu gh foam fractionating. Optional addition of hydroxyl radicals 
was realized with the ECTOSYS system. The electric current required for electrolyzation was 
generated by a laboratory power supply (model EA -PS 3032 -05 B, HEIDE power GmbH, Pürgen, 
Germany). The  applied potential (V) and current (A) on the BDD -electrodes were recorded by hand.  
 
2.2 Experimental set up and procedure  
 
2.2.1 Pre - experiments  
 
Pre-experiments were carried out to determine TRO formation and ORP behavior, energy 
consumption and nitrit e and ammonia removal by different current densities and different water 
matrices. Differences in water matrices were obtained by changing the applied feed load and make -up 
water flow.  
 
2.2.3 Longterm experiment  
 
The long term experiment consisted of thre e experimental periods of 14 days each, 4 adaptation days 
and 10 experimental days. The first 4 days, the adaptation period, fish were fed 1 kg feed per day and 
water exchange rates were set at 10% total volume per day (4.1m3/kg feed applied /d). Additional ly 
foam fractionating was enhanced by ozone injection and in contrast to experimental periods foam was 
discarded to maximize nutrient removal from the system water (see table 1).  
During the next 10 day experimental period fish were fed until apparent sati ation twice a day. After 5 
days (120 hours) experimental period the makeup water flow was closed to artificially increase CFB. 
Because water was discarded through the backwashing of the drum filter, water level in the tanks was 
lowered to maintain constant  water levels in the pump -sump. Lowering of water in tanks was equal for 
all 3 experimental periods. Water treatment during the 3 experimental periods of 10 days consisted of:  
 
 Control (I):  Drum filter, moving bed biological nitrification, sedimentation  
 BDD (II):  equal to control + continues applied current on BDD -electrodes.  
 Ozone (III):  equal to control + continues ozone addition  
 
In order to ensure comparability of treatment (II) and (III), dosages of hydroxyl radicals and ozone 
were standardized at TR O concentration ≤ 0.06 mg/l in the culture tanks. Therefore, the TRO 
concentration was measured at the inflow and outflow of the disinfection unit (electrocell or 
ozonation) and in the culture tanks, once a day in the control treatment and 5 to 6 times a d ay during 
ozone or BDD treatment.  96

2.3 Water quality analysis  
 
Water sa mples for the pre -experiments were taken at the inflow and outflow of the electrocell or 
ozonation, respectively. During the long -term experiment water quality samples were taken at the 
inflow, however for TRO samples were directly measured at the in - and out-flow of the protein 
skimmer, respectively electrocell. TP and O -P were measured spectrophotometrically with the 
ascorbic acid method using a microplate reader Infinite 200 (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland) 
according to the protocols of Grasshoff et al. ( 1999) and adapted to microplate format. TAN, NO 2-N, 
NO 3-N and TRO were determined spectrophotometrically using a HACH -DR 2800 spectrophotometer 97 
 (Hach -Lange GmbH, Berlin, Germany) and powder pillow detection kits (Hach -Lange GmbH, Berlin, 
Germany) based on the ammonia salicylate method, diazotization method,  the cadmium reduction 
method, 1,10 Phenantrolin method  and the N,N-diethyl -p-phenylenediamine (DPD) method,  
respectively. Total residual oxidants (TRO) is the name used for all substances that oxidize N, N-
diethyl -p-phenylenediamine (DPD). Oxidants known to measure with the Hach -Lange DPD method 
include all free and total chlorine and bromine. Interference with trihalomethanes (THM) chloramines, 
bromamines or organic chloramines is minimal due to quick rea ction of free chlorine and colormetric  
determination within seconds after measurement (Harp 2002) . TRO is measured in mmol/l but 
notated during the present study as clorine (Cl 2) equivalents in mg/l. TOC was analyzed as non 
purgable organic carbon using a total organic carbon analyzer TOC -V CPH/CPN (Shimadzu corp., 
Kyoto, Japan). Dissolved metals were analyzed in duplicate using Inductively coupled plasma mass 
spectrometry (ICP -MS) method (TeLa, Technische Lebensmittel - und Umweltanalytik GmbH, 
Bremerhafe n, Germany) in 100 ml samples. Temperature and pH were measured with a WTW 340i 
portable multiparameter instrument (WTW GmbH, Weilheim, Germany), salinity with a digital 
refractometer  HI 96822 (HANNA Instruments, Woonsocket, USA)  and dissolved oxygen with a 
Handy Polaris oxygen probe (Oxygard International A/S, Birkenrød, Denmark) ORP with a redox 
probe (Hach Lange GmbH, 1200 -S sc). Dissolved colored organic matter (CDOM) was determined by 
direct absorption at 436 nm of pre -filtered (0.22 µm) culture water and compared against a blank of 
artificial seawater (ASW) at 20 g l-1 Cl-. Absorption was measured with a microplate reader Infinite 
200 (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland). A BMT ozone analyser 963 (BMT Messtechnik GmbH, Berlin, 
Germany) was used to determine  ozone addition by measuring flow rate and ozone concentration in 
the gas stream.  
 
2.4 Microbial analysis  
 
Water samples for the pre -experiments were taken at the inflow and outflow of the electrocell or 
ozonation, respectively. Samples were taken one by  one. Directly after each sample was taken, the 
respective sample was diluted and analyzed by the spread plate method using an unspecific marine 
agar (Difco Marine Agar, BD, Sparks, USA) for the detection of total viable cell counts, as well as a 
Vibrio sp . specific agar (Difco TCBS Agar, BD, Sparks, USA) for the detection of Vibrios. Colony 
forming units per plate were recorded after 24 h and 96 h of incubation at 28 °C.  
 
2.5 Assumptions and formulas  
 
 
Current density (CD) was calculated as follows:  
 98 
 CD =  Applied current (A) / working surface electrode      (1) 
 
Working surface electrode (WSE) was calculated as follows  
 
WSE = surface electrode * active area electrode * surface factor     (2) 
 
In this case the surface of an electrode = radius² * П, the radius was 50 mm. The active area of an 
electrode is the area functioning actively as anode, which is dependent on the three dimensional 
arrangement of the electrodes pair which depends if an elec trode is active on one or both sides. 
Because we used 3 pairs, 2 anodes were active at both sides and 1 electrode was active at only 1 site. 
Thus the total active area in our case was 5. The surface factor is a correction for the roughness of the 
diamond s urface and a correction for the fact that a mesh is used, not a plate, the surface factor used 
here is 1.8.   
Thus value used for WSE is (0.05*0.05*П)*5*1.8= 0.0707 m².  
 
To compare ozonation and BDD treatment the amount of charge applied was converted into mole 
according to:  
 
1 Faraday = charge of one mole e-       (3) 
1 Faraday = 96485.3399 C         (4) 
1 C = 1 A *s          (5) 
 
When oxidized or produced substances are plotted against Faraday, the oxidant equivalent of 1 mole, 
the current efficiency can be estimated.  
 
Current efficiency = substance X (mole) / Faraday                                       (6) 
 
For ozone, molar  efficiencies can be calculated in the same way                      
 
Molar  efficiency  = substance X (mole) / O 3 (mole)                                                         (7) 
  
To compare the accumulation of substances in the culture water  the function cumulative feed burden 
(CFB) is used. This function is describes the amount of feed added per volume of water, corrected for 
water exchange and is calculated as follow:  
 
CFB x+1 = (CFB x + Feed added (g) / V total (l)) ^ ( -V/V total)     (8) 
 99 
 where “feed added” is the amount of feed added per tank in g, “V total“ is the total culture volume and 
“–V” is the amount of water replaced.  
 
As CFB was set to 0 at the start of the experiment although the initial process water matrix was not 
free of accumu lating substances, accumulating water parameters (NO3 -N, OP, TP, TOC, metals and 
dissolved matter) are presented as increase of the parameter:  
 
F(x) = mx + b           (9) 
 
where x is the cumulative feed burden, F(x) is the accumulation of the water param eter and b is the 
consumption or production of the parameter at a CFB = 0.  
 
Reduction efficiency for disinfection was calculated as the difference in CFU between inflow and 
outflow  
 
RE (%)  = (CFU inflow – CFU outflow  / CFU inflow)*100      (10) 
 
Reduction of CFU was calculated for Vibrio sp  (Vibrio %), total bacterial counts after 24 hours (24 h 
%) and for total bacteria after 96 hours (96 h %).  
 
2.6 Data analysis  
 
Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) of n samples. Statistical analysis of varia nces 
was performed using SPSS 20.0 (IBM inc, Armonk, USA). Data were tested for normality and for 
equal variances using Levene’s test and the Shapiro -Wilk test, respectively. Consequently the Tukeys -
HSD post -hoc test, Dunett -T3 test or the Kruskal -Wallis t est followed by  the Mann -Whitney U test 
for pairwise comparisons was used. For the comparison of two means with a normal distribution 
Students T -test was used. For comparison of two means with a non -normal distribution the Mann -
Withney U test was used. Si ngle comparisons were carried out by paired or unpaired t -tests. Linear 
regression was conducted using Graphpad (Graphpad software inc., La Jolla, USA ). Differences were 
considered as significant at p<0.05.  
 
3. Results  
 
3.1 Short term experiments  
 100 
 The rel ation between the applied current and the potential needed to apply a charge on the electrocell 
could be described with a 2nd order polynomial regression (figure 1). The minimum potential needed to 
apply a charge was 2.7 V. From 2 A onwards, the relation b etween applied current and the potential 
needed could be described by a linear function, meaning that direct energy costs (V*A) to apply a 
charge (C), is favorable below 2 A (28 A/m²).  
 
Figure 2. Relation between applied current on the electrocell and pot ential needed to apply charge.  
 
Although different water exchange rates were applied, differences in water quality were only 
distinctive in color  absorption and pH, but not in other water quality parameters measured (figure 2). 
The relations between TRO fo rmation and applied current density at different water exchange rates 
could be accurately (r² = 0.986 -0.997) described by a 2nd order polynomials. Accordingly current 
densities followed an almost linear relation with current efficiency for the high and sta ndard water 
exchange rates, for the low water exchange rates current efficiency was constant between 7 and 28 
A/m² also followed by a linear increase (figure 2). The slope of the increase in current efficiency was 
significantly lower for low or standard wa ter exchange rates compared to high exchange rates (F -test, 
n=7,  p<0.001) but not between low and standard exchange rates.  
Oxidation reduction potential showed similar behavior for all three water exchange rates tested. A 
clear decrease in ORP between 0 a nd 28 A/m² followed by an increase in ORP.

densities (n=3) and calculated current efficiencies in different water matrices. Main water quality 
parameters of the different matrices are described in the table.  
 
Concentrations of TAN, and TOC were compared between inflow and outflow at a current densities 
between 0 and 71 A/m², however no significant differences were observed (paired t -test, n=6, p>0.0 5), 
for nitrite and yellow substances significant differences for the highest 2 current densities, 57 A/m² 
and 71 A/m² were observed (paired t -test, n=6, p<0.05), data are not shown.  
 
3.2 Long term experiment  
 
No significant differences in daily feed intak e between treatments were observed (Tukey -HSD, n=10, 
p<0.05) however total feed intake for control group (36.6 kg) was much lower compared to feed intake 
during BDD and ozone treatments, 45.4 and 45.5 kg respectively (table 1). Consequently the 
maximum CFB  achieved was 0.82 kg/m³ for the control group and 0.97 kg/m³ and 0.98 kg/m³ for the 
BDD and ozone treatments.  
No significant differences in temperature, pH and nitrite -N concentrations between treatments were 
observed (Tukey -HSD, n=10, p>0.05). Salinity w as significantly higher for BDD treatment compared 
to control (Tukey -HSD, n=10, p<0.05) but not between ozone and control or BDD treatment (Tukey -
HSD, n=10, p>0.05). Conductivity was found significant between all treatments (Tukey -HSD, n=10, 
102 
 p<0.05). Total  ammonia nitrogen was significantly higher for ozone treatment compared to the other 
two treatments (Tukey -HSD, n=10, p<0.05) (table 1).

The amount of oxidants added was diffe rent between BDD and control treatment (table 2). From day 4 
on, applied doses of ozone was limited by the maximum output of the ozone generator at 240 g/d. 
Consequently average TRO concentrations in the culture tanks were found significantly different 
between treatments (Kruskall -Wallis, n=10, 64, 55, p<0.001) and differences were considered 
significantly different between all treatments (Mann -Whitney, p<0.01). The amount of TRO produced, 
calculated as the difference between out -flow and in -flow of the ele ctrocell or protein skimmer 
combined with ozonation, was significantly higher for the protein skimmer (Mann -Whitney, n=64, 55, 
p<0.01) (table 2).  
For both treatments significant reduction of Vibrio  counts were observed (One -sample T test, n=6, 
p<0.05). For  total bacteria counts after 24 hours significant lower counts were observed for the BDD 
treatment (One -sample T test, n=6, p<0.05) but not for ozone. For bacterial counts after 96 hours no 
significant effect for both treatments was observed. However no si gnificant differences between 
treatments, for any of the bacterial counts, were found (independent T test, n=6, p>0.05).  
Although some disinfection effects were found, no significant differences in bacterial load in the 
culture tank between different treat ments were found (Tukey -HSD, n=6, p>0.05) (table 2).

A significant accumulation of CDOM was found in the control treatment and the correlation 
coeffici ent was high. Accumulation of CDOM in the BDD treatment was significantly lower 
compared to control, but significantly higher compared to ozone treatment (Tukey -HSD, n=10, 
p<0.01).   
In the control group the accumulation of TOC was also found significant a nd highly dependent on the 
CFB. In contrast to CDOM, the accumulation of TOC in the ozone treatment was not significantly 
different compared to control (Tukey HSD, n=10, p>0.05). In the BDD treatment no significant 
accumulation of TOC took place, and was t herefore significantly lower compared to control or ozone 
treatment (Tukey HSD, n=10, p<0.001).  
Nitrate showed significant accumulation in all groups and no significant differences between 
treatments were observed (Tukey HSD, n=10, p>0.05).  
Total phosphor us showed significant accumulation in all groups and no significant differences 
between treatments were observed (Tukey HSD, n=10, p>0.05). Ortho -P showed significant 
accumulation in the control and ozone group and no significant differences were observed,  in the BDD 
treatment however no significant ortho -P accumulation was observed, and the accumulation was 104 
 therefore significantly lower compared to control or ozone treatment (Tukey HSD, n=10, p<0.05) 
(figure 3).

Although increase in Iron and Zinc was observed with increasing CFB, accumulation was not found 
significant (one sampled t -test, n=3, p>0.05 ) and no significant differences in average concentrations 
between treatments were found (Tukey HSD, n=3, p>0.05). Arsenic concentrations were comparable 
between treatment and no differences were observed. For Cobalt and Manganese higher, values were 
obser ved in the control group compared to BDD or ozone groups, but because some data were below 
detection limits no statistics was done. For Cadmium and Copper no concentrations above the 
detection limits were found (table 3).

4. Discussion  
In general in RAS ozonation is combined with foam fractionating or flocculation which improves the 
removal efficiency of both particulate and dissolved metabolites. Such a system is not yet developed 
for BDD t reatment in RAS. Therefore during the present study only the chemical oxidation capacity of 
both ozone and BDD treatment were compared, to exclude biased effects on mechanical removal 
efficiency. Both methods were standardized on a TRO safety level of 0.06  mg/l in the culture tanks 
(Reiser et al., 2010). Irrespective of ozone doses applied, average TRO maxima in the culture tanks 
were not reached. As a result ozone doses was limited by maximal ozone generator output at 240 g/d, 
providing an ozone doses of 5 3 g/kg feed which is roughly double of the maximum doses advised 
under normal usage (Timmons and Ebeling, 2010). Therefore by combining oxidation with 
mechanical removal, the removal efficiency of nutrients is likely to increase, likewise an increased 
form ation of disinfection by -products can then be expected.  
 
4.1 TRO formation and ORP behavior  
 
Treatment of natural waters containing bromide and chloride with BDD electrodes results in the 
formation of disinfection by -products. Observed by products are free  bromine and chlorine species, 
bromamines and chloramines which are called total residual oxidants (TRO), trihalomethanes (THMs) 
with bromoform being the major THM species, and bromate, chlorate and perchlorate (Bergmann and 
Rollin, 2007, Diaz et al., 2011 , Echardt and Kornmueller, 2009, van Bussel 2013b).  
TROs are extremely toxic to marine fish and shrimp species, adverse effects on morphology and 
survival already observed at concentrations of 0.06 respectively 0.10 mg/l Cl2 (Reiser et al., 2010, 
Schroede r et al., 2010) although more sensitive parameters such as feed intake or feed conversion were 106 
 not assessed. Bromoform is less toxic to marine fish and shrimp but abnormal behavior such as r apid 
swimming in random directions thereby hitting the tank walls,  are observed at concentrations as low as 
0.4 mg/l (Gibson et al., 1979) but again feed intake or feed conversion were not assessed. Bromate and 
chlorate are least toxic to marine fish with reported long term LC -50 values for bromate in the range of 
200-500 mg/l (Hutchinson et al., 1997).  For chlorate no toxicity data on marine fish are available but 
fresh water fish species 96h LC -50 vary between 800 and 10,000 mg/l (van Wijk and Hutchinson 
1995).   
Observed TRO concentrations in marine waters after BDD tr eatment can exceed safety levels for 
aquaculture in magnitudes. Echardt and Kornmueller (2009) reported TRO concentrations of 1.4 mg/l 
in BDD treated marine ballast water, and Diaz et al. (2011) reported concentrations up to 8 mg/l in 
BDD treated marine aq uacul ture water. However the present study and other recent studies (van 
Bussel 2013a, van Bussel 2013b) showed that in both fresh and marine aquaculture water effective 
water treatment by TRO concentration ≤ 0.06 mg/l is possible.  
The present short term exper iments showed that the TRO formation increased with the applied current. 
This is a logical consequence of an increased amount of charge, and thus mole electrons available to 
oxidize ions such as bromine and chlorine. This increased TRO formation at increas ed applied current 
on DBB electrodes is also observed in other studies (Bergmann and Rollin, 2007, Diaz et al., 2010, 
van Bussel 2013a). During the present study the formation of TRO was depending on water quality, 
whereas TRO formation in `dirty` water, w ith low exchange rate, was significantly lower as in 
standard or `cleaner` water. As a result of TRO formation the amount of charge needed to form a 
defined amount of residual oxidants, expressed as the current efficiency, was also dependent on water 
matri x. An increase in current efficiency with increased current densities was observed for all 
treatments, except for the low water exchange treatment where constant current efficiency was 
observed between 7 and 28 A/m². The ORP behavior was similar in all thr ee water matrixes, where a 
decrease in ORP was observed below 28 A/m², followed by a linear increase. Simultaneously to TRO 
formation, oxidation of yellow substances and nitrite was observed during the pre -experiments as it 
could be observed in small -scale d systems in a previous study (van Bussel 2013a). The presence of 
both nitrite and yellow substances is known to scavenge oxidants, and therefore reduce the formation 
of TRO during ozonation (Schroeder et al., 2011). Because nitrite concentration was compa rable 
between water matrices in the present pre -experiments, the difference in TRO formation is likely a 
result of different concentrations CDOM, which was a factor 5 -9 lower in the high and standard water 
exchange compared to low exchange rates. Other dif ferences in the water matrix, such as in salinity, 
pH and temperature were minimal and are therefore not likely to explain differences in TRO formation 
(Hsu, 2005).  
Next to the scavenging of ozone or hydroxyl radicals by humic acids, breaking the large mo lecules 
into smaller bio -available fractions, bromoform is formed (Cooper et al.  1985). During the present 
study THMs were not measured. Reported THM concentrations after BDD treatment do also exceed 107 
 safety values. Reported concentrations of THMs ranged b etween 0.3 – 1.6 mg/l, with bromoform 
being the major THM accounting for 85 -96% on weight basis (Echardt and Kornmueller, 2009, Diaz 
et al., 2010). Diaz et al. (2010) observed that the amount of total THM formed by equal applied 
charges (Ah) was much highe r at lower current densities (10 -30 A/m²) than at 50 A/m². Because THM 
are not detected by the DPD method, oxidant scavenging by humic acids and successively THM 
formation can be an explanation for the relative low current efficiencies of TRO formation obs erved 
below 28 A/m². The decrease in redox potential below 28 A/m², is a second indication for oxidant 
scavenging by humic acids and/or formation of persistent residual oxidants such as THMs, instead of 
the formation of reactive chlorine/bromine species.  
During all three periods of the long -term experiment average TRO concentrations were within 
acceptable levels for turbot culture (Reiser et al., 2010). The amount of TRO produced by ozonation 
was higher than amounts of TRO produced by BDD treatment. The TRO  degradation in the system 
was higher during the ozonation treatment than for BDD -treatment, resulting in higher TRO levels in 
the culture tank during BDD treatment. This indicates that the TROs produced with the BDD 
treatment were more persistent than ozo ne produced oxidants.  
Thus TRO and THM formation and accumulation is limiting the application of BDD electrodes in 
RAS. Minimizing of residual oxidant formation is therefore a key -point in RAS water treatment with 
BDD electrodes.   
 
4.2 Disinfection perfo rmance and bacterial pressure  
 
Disinfection performance of both ozone and BDD treatment were low for Vibrio  sp. and low or absent 
for total bacteria counts after 24 and 96 hours of incubation. Upon ozonation, particles present in the 
water protected bacter ia, increasing the c*t values needed to achieve 90% reduction roughly a 3 -fold 
up to 0.19 mg/l minute (Hess -Erega et al., 2008). The c*t values during the present study in the protein 
skimmer, 1.5 minutes HRT * TRO 0.13 mg/l = 0.195, were in the same range . However the produced 
TRO in the protein skimmer, thus the effective c*t values, were only 0.135 mg/l minute resulting in 
average reduction rates of 30 -62 %, similar disinfection efficiencies as observed by Hess -Erega et al. 
(2008).  
For BDD treatments dat a on disinfection efficiency in saline water are limited to two studies. Echhardt 
and Kormueller (2009) observed disinfection efficiencies of >95 % for saline water (15 ppt) with high 
organic loads during ballast water treatment. However in this study wate r was treated twice with 
BDD -electrodes producing TRO values up to 1.4 mg/l and time between treatments was 5 days, 
resulting in extremely high c*t values which are not applicable for RAS.. In the other study (van 
Bussel et al. 2013a) disinfection efficien cies of 5 -60 % were observed and applied doses of charge was 
limited by TRO formation and accumulation, similar to the present study.         108 
 No differences in bacterial counts between different treatments were observed. The number of 
bacterial counts in R AS water is dependent on the CFB, e.g. the water exchange rates per amount of 
feed given can also affected by disinfection (Leonard et al. 2000, van Bussel et al., 2013). The absence 
of effects on bacterial counts during the present study is the result of bacterial doubling time and time 
between water passes the disinfection unit. Leonard et al. (2000) estimated the doubling time of 
bacteria which were not bound to a biofilm in marine RAS by 25 °C at 2 h 50 minutes. In studies with 
significant reduction of bacterial numbers due to disinfection, the time between water passing the 
disinfection unit twice was ≤1 hour and thus less than the bacteria doubling time resulting in an 
effective reduction potential (Park et al., 2013, Leonard et al. 2000,  Schroeder et al., 2010, 2011, van 
Bussel et al. 2013a).  
Thus to achieve effective reduction of bacterial counts in marine RAS, reduction efficiency and thus 
disinfectant exposure must be relatively high due to particle protection. Furthermore the HRT of the 
system befo re water enters the disinfection unit again must be short enough to encounter re -growth. 
Therefore this can only be obtained by treatment of large parts of the water flow, not in by -passes such 
as in regular protein skimmers. Beside the limitations of TRO formation and disinfection of large 
water flows, it can be questioned if in -system disinfection is desirable. After strong disinfection there 
is a destabilization of the microbial community in RAS (Attramadal 2012) and due to high availability 
of nutrients  and a lack of competition the growth of opportunistic bacteria could be supported (Hess -
Erega et al., 2010). Opportunistic bacteria in RAS are mainly species which are potentially pathogenic 
and favor a short HRT (Schneider et al ., 2007 ). Therefore managi ng constant water exchange rates to 
maintain stable bacterial populations (Leonard et al. , 2000) and reducing organic load to decreased 
overall bacterial growth (Maeda et al. , 1997) can be a better strategy to control healthy microbial 
populations. The use  of oxidation processes must therefore be optimized for nutrient removal, in order 
to maintain low bacterial pressure, and not for direct disinfection.   
 
4.3 Accumulation of (in) -organics and treatment effects  
 
During the present study nitrate was not inf luenced by treatment with ozone or BDD electrodes. 
Ozone is known to affect nitrate concentrations during ozonation (Tanga and Gagnon 2000) however 
this is due to better organic removal and therefore less protein being degraded to nitrate in the 
biofiltrat ion unit. BDD treatment is known to prevent nitrate formation by an anodic process known as 
breakpoint bromination or by nitrate removal via cathodic processes (Kraft, 2003,  Georgaud et al., 
2011, Levy -Clement 2005,  Bergmann and Rollin 2007, Michels et al.  2010, Cabeza et al., 2007). 
However both methods have serious disadvantages when applied in RAS water. Breakpoint 
bromination, in marine water often falsely described  as breakpoint chlorination, is a bromine ion 
catalyzed oxidation of ammonia to N 2 via th e intermediated dibromamine (NHBr 2), and tribromamine 
(NBr 3). But TRO concentrations of <0.6 mg/l are needed before this reaction takes place (Schroeder et 109 
 al., 2011). Furthermore the presence of nitrite and yellow substances is preventing the accumulation  of 
free bromine and thus prevent ing breakpoint bromination (Diaz et al. 2011, Schroeder et al., 2011). 
Beside the highly toxic TRO concentrations needed before breakpoint bromination is realized 
unwanted by -products such as THMs, chloramines, NO 2 and NO 3 are formed  (Diaz et al. 2010, 
Bergmann and Rollin 2007, Kraft 2003). The cathodic reaction mechanism of nitrate to N2 on DBB 
electrodes is not fully understood, but reaction mechanisms are slow and by -products such as TAN, 
NO 2, TRO and chloramines are for med (Kraft 2003, Levy -clement 2005, Georgaud 2011). Therefore 
anodic breakpoint bromination is considered risky and unpractical for RAS purposes. Cathodic nitrate 
removal on electrodes combined with anodic oxidation on BDD electrodes at low current densiti es to 
prevent high TRO formation is a future technique that requires further research.  
 
During the present study the accumulation of DCOM was reduced by both ozone and BDD treatment 
but could not be prevented. The removal of DCOM is not a complete oxidati on of organic carbon to 
CO 2 but a breakdown of double bindings in long non -biodegradable molecules into smaller 
biodegradable molecules (Tanga and Gagnon, 200). Accumulation of DCOM was lowest in the ozone 
treatment, similar observations have been made in small -scaled experiments (van Bussel et al., 2013) 
and can be explained by a preferred reaction of ozone with humic acids over other accumulating 
metabolites (Schroeder et al., 2011). Next to a lower addition of oxidant compared to ozone, BDD 
produced hydr oxyl radicals are more unspecific in their reaction partners resulting in a lower removal 
of DCOM. The overall accumulation of TOC was lower in the BDD treatment compared to ozonation 
and control treatment. Both ozone and BDD treatment are known to reduce the accumulation of TOC 
in RAS (van Bussel et al., 2013). Other data on TOC removal by BDD electrodes in marine water are 
lacking but the formation of THMs, as discussed above, is an indication for the oxidation of organics 
by both free bromines and free c hlorines (Diaz et al., 2010, Echardt and Kornmueller, 2009). The 
absence of effects on TOC during ozonation might be the preferred reaction with humic acids over 
other metabolites (Schroeder et al., 2011). In contrast to CDOM removal, TOC must be fully oxi dized 
to CO 2 by oxidation or by heterotrophic bacteria conversion before it is removed from the system. 
Furthermore due to a lack of particle removal by protein skimming or improved flocculation, the rate 
of chemical oxidation of TOC to CO 2 is expected to be low (Tagno and Gagnon, 2003). Further 
research is needed to see if BDD -treatment also can improve mechanical removal due to flocculation 
of suspended particles and if a combination of BDD -treatment and foam fractionating would be useful 
to improve TOC r emoval by BDD treatment even more.  
 
The accumulation of total phosphorus was equal in treatments suggesting that no phosphorus was 
removed from the water due to treatment. Ortho -P accumulation was not influenced by ozone 
treatment. Ozone does improve parti cle removal due to flocculation or improved protein skimming, 
reducing the leaching effect of particulate phosphorus to ortho -P. Due to the absence of protein 110 
 skimming no reduced leaching can be expected. In the present study ortho -P accumulation during th e 
BDD treatment was significantly reduced. Because total phosphorus accumulation was not effected by 
treatment, ortho -P must be converted to another chemical form. Hydroxyl radicals are known to carry 
out electron transfer with HPO 4- and PO 4- to form hydro xide ions and a phosphoric acid ion with a 
changed valence state (Black and Hayon, 1970, Thomas 1965). Because ortho -P could be absorbed by 
CaCO 3 in seawater (Millero et al., 2001), it might be that ortho -phosphate was converted to calcium 
phosphate. Other  studies in aquaculture water and agricultural waste water have also reported ortho -P 
or total phosphorus removal after hydroxyl radical addition by electrolysation methods (Feng et al., 
2003, van Bussel et al., 2013a, van Bussel et al., 2013b). The lack o f total phosphorus removal but 
significant ortho -phosphate removal during the present study is probably a result of the conversion of 
ortho -P to particulate phosphorus, but a lack of suspend solids removal. Combining electrochemical 
treatment of aquacultur e water, combined with particle removal by flocculation, protein skimming or 
sedimentation might therefore be a promising technique to reduce phosphate emissions of fish 
production in RAS.      
 
 
4.4 Energy consumption and maintenance  
 
The relation between  applied current and potential needed showed a logarithmic function up to 28 
A/m² followed by a linear increase. Consequently the energy consumption is more efficient at current 
densities below 28 A/m² compared with higher current densities. Similar result s were observed by 
Diaz et al. (2011) who observed lowest energy consumption to completely oxidize ammonia in marine 
RAS water at a current density of 10 A/m², higher energy consumption at a current density of 20 A/m² 
and equal but higher energy consumptio n at 30 and 50 A/m².  
During the 10 days experiment no differences in potential needed to apply the same current were 
observed, meaning that the electrical resistance of the electrodes did not change during the experiment. 
Energy consumption was therefore constant over the 10 days and energy consumption, without 
considering the energy costs of the electric power converter, was as low as 96 Wh or 2.3 Wh m-³.  
Although no increase in electrical resistance was observed, build -up of limestone on the electrodes 
was observed at the end of the 10 day period although current was changed twice daily (figure 4). The 
buildup of limestone is a phenomenon often observed when calcium rich water is treated (Fryda et al., 
2003, Diamadopoulos et al., 2009, van Bussel et al.,  2013a, 2013b) and is considered problematic 
because it change the surface available for hydroxyl radical production and thus changing the applied 
current density. For future application in RAS the formation of limestone has to be prevented in order 
to mai ntain optimal current densities and prevent increased TRO formation due to a reduction in 
available electrode surface and thus higher current densities.

5. Conclusions  
Results from the present study confirm findings of previous experiments in small -scaled RAS that safe 
and effective water treatment with BDD electrodes directly in the culture water of a marine RAS is 
possible. By applied current densities of 14 A/m² and 0.02 Ah m-3 d-1 the concentrations of TRO in the 
culture tanks could be kept at ≤ 0.06 mg/l which are considered safe for marine fish and shrimp 
culture. As a result of oxidant addition by BDD electrodes significant lower accumulations of DCOM, 
TOC and ortho -P were observed, although TP levels were not changed. The formation and 
accumulation of TRO in the culture water is a serious limitation for the applied doses of oxidant 
addition. Furthermore the forma tion of a limestone/biofilm, which changes the actual current density 
should be prevented for optimal application. Additional filtration such as flocculation or protein 
skimming is advised to reduce TOC levels further and to effectively remove TP from the culture 
water.

 Abstract  
 
Hydroxyl radicals, which can be produced on Boron Doped Diamonds (BDD) electrodes c ould be an 
alternative water treatment in fresh water recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) due to their high 
oxidation potential. Therefore small scale RAS were equipped in triplicate with biological and 
mechanical filtration (control), with additional ozonation (ozone) or additional BDD electrodes with 
an electrolyte -membrane between electrodes (OS) or without (SS). Tanks were stocked with 40 
European eels ( Anguilla Anguilla ) (250 ± 37 g) each and cultured for 30 days. Applied doses of 
oxidants were lim ited by a residual oxidant concentration of 0.06 mg/l Cl2 in the culture tanks.  
In control and ozone treatments chloride and bromide accumulated, in OS and SS treatments 
practically all chloride and bromide were converted into chlorate, bromate and other r esidual oxidants. 
Average concentrations of nitrite were significantly elevated in both BDD treatments, average 
concentrations of total ammonia, Na, Ca, Mg, Fl did not significantly vary between treatments.  
All oxidation processes significantly reduced the  accumulation of TOC, but no significant differences 
between the different processes were observed. Nitrate and ortho -phosphate accumulation were lower 
in both BDD treatments, although differences were only considered significant between ozone and OS 
or SS  respectively between control or ozone and SS. Significant disinfection was only found for 
ozone, however bacterial densities in culture tanks were not affected by any treatment and no clear 
effects on prevalence of bacterial infections was observed. Infec tion with gill parasites ( Dactylogyrus  
sp.) was significantly increased in BDD treatments. Like in marine water, limestone formation was 
observed on the electrodes requiring intensive maintenance and affecting applied current densities.  
We conclude that t he accumulation of toxic residual oxidant does limit application in RAS, even in 
fresh water. Compared to ozonation the formation and accumulation of stabile residual oxidant is a 
clear disadvantage. Therefore minimization of residual oxidant formation is needed. Further research 
on end -of-the-pipe treatment instead of in system treatment of aquaculture waste water with BDD 
electrodes is advised.

 1. Introduction  
 
Clean fresh water is scarce on global scale, and aquaculture production is one source of eutr ophication. 
Water consumption per amount fish produced is dependent on the production system used. Extensive 
systems, most widely used worldwide, consume roughly 500 m³ per kg fish produced, intensive 
raceway systems 50 -5 m³ whereas recirculating aquacultu re systems (RAS) consume only 0.1 m³ per 
kg fish produced making RAS production favorable with respect to nutrient release (Fitwi et al., 2012, 
Martins et al., 2010). However due to this low water consumption and thus intensive production waste 
products du e accumulate in the culture water, potentially affecting health or growth performance 
(Martins et al., 2009, Davidson et al., 2009). Technical improvements in water treatment loops of RAS 
are therefore needed to optimize production, however increased opera ting costs can negatively affect 
profitability of such systems (Blancheton et al., 2007, Martins et al. 2010).  Therefore there is a need 
for low cost water treatment units in fresh water RAS.  
Electrolyzation is price effective way of (drink/industry) wat er treatment and boron doped diamond 
(BDD) electrodes are the most suitable and economical electrode type of electrode to remove organic 
pollutants from waste water, due to low electrochemical formation of oxygen and high oxidant 
formation, and thus effect ive pollutant oxidation (Kapalka et a. 2008). In marine RAS BDD electrodes 
have successfully been used to continuously treat water resulting in lower accumulation of organic 
matter and ortho -phosphate however the formation of fish toxic total residual oxid ants (TRO) limits 
the applied doses of oxidants by BDD electrodes (van Bussel 2013a, 2013b) which are mainly free 
bromine and free chlorine species (Echardt and Kornmueller 2009). However the accumulation of 
more stable residual oxidant such as bromate, ch lorate and chlorinated or brominated organics were 
not assessed and might also accumulate and limit application in RAS. Data available on the use of 
BDD electrodes are limited to marine RAS (Diaz et al., 2010, van Bussel et al. 2013a, 2013b). All 
these stu dies indicate that effective oxidation/conversion of organics, phosphates and nitrogen species 
are possible, but also indicate that application is limited by residual oxidant formation.   
In fresh water RAS concentrations of chloride and bromide ions are r oughly a factor 500 -1000 lower 
than in marine RAS. Due to this difference in chloride/bromide concentration the formation of free 
chlorines and bromines (TRO) on BDD electrodes might be a less limiting factor in fresh water RAS.  
Thus the aim of the present  study was to test suitability of BDD electrodes for water treatment in fresh 
water RAS.  Effects of waste product accumulation, bacterial counts, disinfection performance and 
infection of eel ( Anguilla anguilla ) with bacteria ( Aeromonas  sp.) and parasites  (Dactylogyrus sp) 
were assessed.   
 
2. Material & Methods  
 
2.1 System setup  120 
  
2.1.1 Electrodes and electro cell set up  
 
The electro cell used in this experiment was the CONDIACELL® CP450 (CONDIAS GmbH, Itzehoe, 
Germany) equipped with 4 pair of electrodes c onsisting of a Niobium carrier material and a 20 µm 
thick Boron doped diamond layer, type DIACHEM® 24*50 mm (CONDIAS GmbH, Itzehoe, 
Germany), called salt water stacks (SS). Three other electrocells were equipped with a solid polymer  
electrolyte  membrane to  increase ozone production (Kraft 2007) so called ozone stacks (OS). 
Electrodes were once weekly cleaned with water and acid (1 molar HCL) to remove the formed 
limestone and biofilm.  
     
2.1.2 RAS set up  
 
The experiments were conducted in 12 small scaled experimental RAS, each with a system set -up as 
exactly as described in van Bussel et al. (2013a).  
Optionally ozone was produced in an ozone -generator (Aquamedic 200 mg/h, Germany) using 
compressed air and was injected at the bottom of the aeration tower b y a wooden air -stone diffuser in 
counter current. Optional addition of hydroxyl radicals took place in the reaction chamber by 
electrolyzing the passing water with BDD -electrodes. The electric current required for electrolyzation 
was generated by a laborat ory power supply (model EA -PS 3032 -05 B, HEIDE power GmbH, Pürgen, 
Germany). In order to measure and compare the energy consumption (kWh) of electrochemical 
treatment and ozonation, an electricity meter was mounted prior to the laboratory power supply and 
the ozone generator, respectively. The applied potential (V) and current (A) on the BDD -electrodes 
were recorded manually.  
 
2.2 Experimental set up and procedure  
 
The 12 small -scaled RAS (figure 1) were divided in 4 system designs with 3 replicates each, providing 
3 different treatments by chemical oxidation and a control without oxidation process:  
 Control:   filter mats, MBBR, aeration tower.  
 Ozone:    equal to control + continuous applied ozone addition.  
 Ozone stack (OS):  equal to control + continuous ap plied current on ozone stacks  
 Saltwater stack (SS):  equal to control+ continuous applied current on saltwater stacks  
 
In order to ensure comparability of treatment Ozone, OS and SS the dosages of hydroxyl radicals and 
ozone were standardized with regard to  residual oxidant concentration in the tanks. Therefore, the 
TRO concentration was measured at the tank inflow in regular time intervals and adjusted to a value of 121 
 ≤ 0.06 mg Cl 2 l-1 by regulating the current applied for the generation of OH -radicals and oz one, 
respectively.  
RAS were filled with a tap water and eel were acclimatized in systems for 7 days. Then a total of 480 
eels with a mean average weight (250 ± 37 g) were randomly divided in groups of 40 individuals and 
distributed to the 12 RAS. Average total wet weight per system was 10,002 ± 45 g resulting in an 
initial density of 33,339 ± 140 g/m3. Temperature was automatically adjusted to 25°C with a 
temperature -controlled 500 W heater (Aqua Medic, Bissendorf, Germany). A photoperiod of 14 h light 
(06:00-20:00) 10 h dark was provided.  Eel were fed by hand with a commercial eel diet (Aller Ivory 
ex 54/20 3 mm., Aller Aqua, Christianfeld, Denmark).  Feed load was restricted, resulting in equal 
amounts of feed, and thus nutrient input, for every tank. Feed ing regime once a day, 7 days per week . 
Feed load was 15 g per day. T ab water was added to maintain total water volume and thus compensate 
for evaporation and cleaning losses.  
The experimental period lasted 30 days. The performance of ozonation as well as  the two different 
BDD electrode stacks were evaluated by determining the accumulation of inorganic (TAN, NO 2-N, 
NO 3-N, ortho -P) and organic (TOC) substance, disinfection performance and the bacterial pressure in 
the culture tanks. Eel health was assessed as mortality, clinical infection with bacterial diseases and 
infection by the parasites Ichthyophthirius multifiliis and Dactylogyrus spp.  
 
2.3 Water quality analysis  
 
Nitrate, sulfate, chlorate, bromate, chloride, bromide, sodium , calcium, magnesium and f luoride were 
analyzed  using high pressure liquid chromatography (LC2010 -HT, Shimadzu corp., Kyoto, Japan) .  
TP and O -P were measured spectrophotometrically with the ascorbic acid method using a microplate 
reader Infinite 200 (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland)  according to the protocols of Grasshoff et al. 
(1999) and adapted to microplate format. TAN, NO 2-N and TRO were determined 
spectrophotometrically using a HACH -DR 2800 spectrophotometer (Hach -Lange GmbH, Berlin, 
Germany) and powder pillow detection kits (H ach-Lange GmbH, Berlin, Germany) based on the 
ammonia salicylate method, diazotization method and the N,N-diethyl -p-phenylenediamine (DPD) 
method,  respectively. TRO is measured in mmol/l but notated during the present study as clorine (Cl 2) 
equivalents in mg/l. TOC was analyzed as non purgable organic carbon using a total organic carbon 
analyzer (TOC -V CPH/CPN, Shimadzu corp., Kyoto, Japan).  
Temperature and pH were measured with a WTW 340i portable multiparameter instrument (WTW 
GmbH, Weilheim, Germany), s alinity with a digital refractometer  HI 96822 (HANNA Instruments, 
Woonsocket, USA)  and dissolved oxygen with a Handy Polaris oxygen probe (Oxygard International 
A/S, Birkenrød, Denmark). A BMT ozone analyser 963 (BMT Messtechnik GmbH, Berlin, Germany) 
was used to determine ozone addition by measuring flow rate and ozone concentration in the gas 
stream.  122 
  
2.4 Microbial analysis  
 
Water samples were taken from the tanks of all treatments for the estimation of bacterial density. 
Furthermore, water samples at t he inflow and the outflow of both tested chemical water treatment 
processes, ozonation and BDD electrolysation, were taken to assess bactericidal efficiencies. Samples 
were taken one by one. Directly after each sample was taken, the respective sample was d iluted and 
analyzed by the spread plate method using an unspecific agar (TSB Agar, BD, Sparks, USA) for the 
detection of total viable cell counts. Colony forming units per plate were recorded after 24 and 96 h of 
incubation at 28° C on.  
 
2.5 Fish health an alysis   
 
Fish were daily inspected for mortality. At the start and end of the experiment all eels were clinically 
assessed for health appearance. Bacterial infection with e.g.  Aeromonas sp.  was assessed according to 
typical clinical signs of infection acc ording to Schaeperclaus, 1979. Eels were scored as positive when 
stripes and bands on side as well as and red spots on belly were visible. Infection was scored as severe 
when the mucus was damaged mucus and white/blue circles were visible, open wounds main ly at the 
tail were visible or when fish were lying at the surface with bent body shape. At the end of the 
experiment three eels were killed and gills and swimbladder were dissected. Gills were sampled using 
a binocular and number of Dactylogyrus spp,  were  counted.  
 
2.5 Assumptions and formulas  
 
Current density (CD) was calculated as follows:  
 
CD = Applied current (A) / working surface electrode      (1) 
 
Working surface electrode (WSE) was calculated as follows  
 
WSE = (length (m) * width electrode (m)) *  active area electrode * surface factor  (2) 
 
Length of an electrode was 75 mm, width was 32 mm. Active areas during the present study using 4 
electrode pairs was 7. The surface factor used here is 1.2. Thus total active area is 20160 mm² or 
0.020160 m².   123 
 To compare the accumulation of substances in the culture water the function cumulative feed burden 
(CFB) is used. This function is combining the amount of feed added per volume of water, corrected 
for water exchange and is calculated as follow:  
 
1 mole e- = 1 mole oxidant         (3) 
1 Faraday = charge of one mole e-       (4) 
1 Faraday = 96485.3399 C         (5) 
1 C = 1 A*s           (6) 
 
When oxidized or produced substances are plotted against Faraday, the mole OH● equivalent, the 
current efficiency can be estimated.  
 
Current efficiency = substance X (mole) / OH● (mole) or Faraday                                     (7)  
 
For ozone, molar  efficiencies can be calculated in the same way                      
 
Molar  efficiency  = substance X (mole) / O 3 (mole)                                                             (8) 
  
To compare the accumulation of substances in the culture water the function cumulative feed burden 
(CFB) is used. This function is combining the amount of feed added per volume of water, correc ted 
for water exchange and is calculated as follow:  
 
CFB = Feed added (g) / V total (l) ^ ( -V/V total)       (9) 
 
where “feed added” is the amount of feed added per tank in g, “V total“ is the total culture volume and 
“–V” is the amount of water replaced.  
 
As CFB was set to 0 at the start of the experiment although the initial process water matrix was not 
free of accumulating substances, accumulating water parameters (NO3 -N, OP, TP, TOC and dissolved 
matter)  are both presented as absolute value and as incre ase of the parameter:  
 
F(x) = mx + b           (10) 
 
where x is the cumulative feed burden, F(x) is the accumulation of the water parameter and b is the 
consumption or production of the parameter at a CFB = 0.  
 124 
 Reduction efficiency for disinfection was ca lculated as the difference in CFU between inflow and 
outflow  
 
RE = (CFU inflow – CFU outflow  / CFU inflow)*100       (11) 
 
 
2.6 Data analysis  
 
Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) of n samples. Statistical analysis of variances 
was performed us ing SPSS 17.0 (IBM inc, Armonk, USA). Linear regression was conducted using 
Graphpad (Graphpad software inc., La Jolla, USA ). Data were tested for normality and for equal 
variances (p<0.05) using Levene’s test and the Kolgomorov -Smirnov test, respectively.  Multiple 
comparisons were carried out by the parametric Tukey’s HSD or the non -parametric Dunnet’s T3 test. 
Single comparisons were carried out by paired or unpaired t -tests. Differences were considered as 
significant at p<0.05.  
 
3. Results  
 
Do to the lo w feed load no significant changes in eel biomass were observed (data not shown).Water 
temperature, oxygen concentrations did not significantly vary between treatments (n=27, Tukey, 
p>0.05). Total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) levels did not accumulate and no sig nificant differences 
between treatments were observed (n=15, Tukey, p>0.05). Nitrite -nitrogen concentrations did not 
accumulate and average concentrations were comparable between control and ozone but were 
significantly higher (n=15, Tukey, p<0.05) for bot h OS and SS treatments. The microelements Na, K, 
Mg, Ca and Fl did not accumulate and did not significantly vary between treatments (n=9, Tukey, 
p>0.05) (table 1). Although not significant there was a trend that average Ca concentrations were 
lower in SS t reatment compared to control or ozone (n=9, Tukey, p<0.1).

Nitrate, total organic carbon (TOC), ortho -phosphate and sulfate did accumulate in all treatments 
(figure 1).  
Nitrate accumulation was sig nificant in all treatments but no significant effect of treatment compared 
to control was found, however accumulation of nitrate in the ozone treatment was significantly higher 
compared to OS and SS treatments (n=3, Tukey, p<0.05).  
TOC accumulation was sig nificant in all treatments and significant lower accumulation (n=3, Tukey, 
p<0.05) was found for all three treatments compared to control, but no significant differences between 
different oxidation processes were found.  
Accumulation of orthophosphate was c omparable between control and ozone, and was lower for both 
BDD treatments (OS and SS), although differences were only found significant between SS and 
control or ozone (n=3, Tukey, p<0.05).  
Sulfate accumulated in all treatments but no significant differen ces between treatments were observed 
(n=3, Tukey, p>0.05).

Average concentrations of TRO in the culture tank were within the safety level of ≥ 0.06 mg/l in all 
tanks. In control groups no TRO was measured, in all other groups significant amoun ts of TRO were 
measured and concentrations in the ozone groups were significantly lower compared to both BDD 
treatments (table 1).  In ozone treatments TRO formation was not limited by applied doses, therefore 
we assume that maximal ozone saturation of the  water was reached. After initial regulation on day 1 -3 
of applied current on BDD electrodes, a constant applied doses of 2.00 A on the OS and a constant 
applied current of 0.75 A on the SS electrodes resulted in relative constant TRO values. TRO levels at  
the outflow of the ozonation or BDD electro cells was equal or higher compared to tank levels, but no 
significant differences between tank and outflow within treatments (n=30, paired t -test, p<0.05) or 
between treatments (n=90, Tukey, p<0.05) were observe d. Although average TRO concentrations 
were lower in the ozone groups, a significant disinfection effect was only found in the ozone 
treatments not in OS or SS treatments, both for opportunistic and total bacterial counts. As a result 
average bacterial cou nts for both types were also lower in ozone treatments compared to all other 
treatments although differences were not found significant (n=6, Tukey, p>0.05).

Chloride and bromide did significantly accumulate with increasing CFB in both the control and ozone 
treatments, in contrast no significant effect (n=3, OLS, p>0.05) on chloride was f ound for both OS and

No significant accumulation of chlorate was observed in both control and ozone tre atments (n=3, OLS,

accumulation was therefore found significantly higher (n=3, Tukey, p<0.05) in both BDD treated 
groups (OS and SS) compared to control or ozone. F inal concentration of chlorate were 1.1 ± 1.0 mg/l

No bromate was observed in any of the sampled tanks at any time point in both control and o zone 
treatments, in contrast bromate was observed in measurements in OS and SS tanks, except for initial

p<0.05) and accumulation rate did not vary between OS and SS  but was significantly higher compared 
to control or ozone (n=3, Tukey, p<0.05) (figure 3). Final concentrations of bromate were 0.04 ± 0.03

4. Discussion  
 
4.1 Oxidants and by -product formation on BDD electrodes in fresh water RAS.  
 
When fresh water is treated with BDD electrodes primarily hydroxyl radicals (OH●) are formed. 
Secondary formation products are hydrogenperoxide (H 2O2), ozone (O 3) and peroxidisulphate (S 2O82-) 
(Bergmann and Rollin, 2007). When fresh water which contains small amounts of Br- and Cl- is 
treated with BDD electrodes, hydroxyl radicals (O H●), chlorine (Cl 2) and bromine (Br 2) are 
simultaneously formed. Hydroxyl radicals have a very short half -life time in the range of milliseconds, 
and both chlorine and bromine are transferred to hypochlorous acid (HOBr) and hypobromous acid 
(HOCl). When su fficient bromine is present hypochlorous acid is substituted by bromine making 
hypobromous acid the main disinfection by -product formed (Echardt and Kornmueller 2009).  
During the present study in both BDD treatments (OS and SS) concentrations of TRO were observed 
at the outflow of the elctrocells and equal or lower concentrations in the tank. Applied currents were 
2.00 respectively 0.75 A on the OS and SS stacks, resulting in current densities of 37 A/m² 
respectively 99 A/m².  Observed TRO values in the BD D treatments reached values as high as 0.20 mg 
l-1 and free bromide available to be oxidized varied between 0.02 and 0.09 mg l-1. Consequently the 
measured TRO values in the BDD treatments must be a combination of at least oxidized bromide and 
one or more other by -products.  
Next to these active by -products, measured as TRO, chlorate and bromate were formed (figure 2) 
which is a second indication that the measured TRO consisted both of free chlorine and bromine 
species. Furthermore, next the formation of TR O, chlorate and bromate it is likely that other 
disinfection by -products were formed during the present study in the BDD treated groups. In the OS 
and SS treatment roughly 12 mg l-1 Cl and 0.06 mg l-1 Br respectively 9 mg l-1 Cl and 0.03 mg l-1 Br 
were not  recovered. Most likely these are chlorinated and brominated organics called trihalomethanes 
(THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs) as were also found after BDD treatment of fresh water by other 
authors (Echardt and Kornmueller 2009).   
 
4.2 Conversion of wast e products by BDD electrodes  
 
The accumulation of nitrate was lower in both BDD treatments compared to ozone but not to control. 
Both oxidation processes, ozone and BDD, do oxidate protein bound nitrogen to nitrate, and 
differences between treatments are therefore not expected. However next to anodic oxidation, some 
electrodes including BDD electrodes can reduce nitrate to nitrogen gas at the cathodic site. However 
conversion efficiencies are mostly low and the by -products ammonia and nitrite might occur ( Kraft 130 
 2003, Georgaud 2011, Bergmann and Rollin 2007). Because significant differences between BDD 
treatment and control were not observed, cathodic nitrate reduction was low or ineffective.  
Next to lower nitrate concentration, nitrite concentrations were significantly elevated compared to 
control groups. This is unexpected because oxidation processes, including BDD treatment, oxidize 
nitrite to nitrate (Kraft 2003, van Bussel et al., 2013a, 2013b). However the nitrite can also be a by -
product of cathodic n itrate reduction as described above. A second explanation can also be an effect of 
negative effect of BDD treatment on biofilter performance. Although TRO levels in the range of 0.05 -
0.15 mg l-1 can improve nitrification rates under circumstances (Klatt, 2 012), it might well be that 
elevated levels of chlorate, bromate and possible THMs and HAAs negatively influence nitrification 
rates of the biofilter.  
Ortho -phosphate accumulation in the BDD treatments was lower as in ozone and control treatments. 
The red uction of orthophosphate during BDD treatment is observed in several studies, both in marine 
and fresh water levels (Feng et al., 2003, van Bussel et al., 2013a, 2013b). Reaction mechanisms are 
unclear however binding of phosphate to calcium complexes foll owed by precipitation is suggested 
(van Bussel et al., 2013a). Although not considered significant, there was a trend that average 
concentrations of calcium were lower due to BDD treatment. Although recently it was found that 
elevated levels of orthophosph ate in RAS might improve fish growth in RAS (Eding et al., 2012, van 
Bussel et al., 2013c) and is thus not beneficial to remove from the culture water, ortho -phosphate is a 
pollutant in RAS effluent water. Therefore further research to describe and optimiz e phosphate 
removal is needed.  
The accumulation of TOC was significantly lower by all three oxidation processes applied. This is due 
to a processes that breakdowns larger organic molecules into smaller fractions and eventually into 
carbon dioxide (Martíne z-Huitle & Ferro 2006). However in RAS it is still unknown to which extend 
TOC reduction by ozone is due to improved particle removal part and thus reduced leaching, or by 
conversion to carbon dioxide. Further research is needed both for BDD and ozone trea tment to 
quantify effects of chemical oxidation and improved particle removal to optimize treatment of 
dissolved and particulate organic carbon in RAS.  
 
4.3 Disinfection and effects on fish health.  
 
Although significant amounts of TRO were produced within the electro -cells no significant bacterial 
reduction or effect on bacterial counts in the culture tanks were observed in the BDD treatments. In 
contrast disinfection with ozone was observed  with lower TRO concentrations, however no effects on 
bacteria den sities in the culture water were found. Clinical infections with bacteria, most probably of 
the Aeromonas  sp. (Schaeperclaus, 1979) were neither affected by treatment. Although the general 
consensus is that reducing bacterial loads decrease bacterial disea ses and therefore disinfection in RAS 
is useful . However it is known that by reducing hydraulic retention time, which can be obtained by 131 
 effective disinfection, fast growing pathogenic bacteria can outcompete other bacteria (Schneider et 
al., 2007). Theref ore relating (the lack of) disinfecting performance and fish health should be done 
with care. Reducing substrate and nutrient availability in RAS in the form of TOC might therefore be a 
better future strategy to control bacterial diseases.  
The infection r ate of eel with  Dactylogyrus  sp. parasites and the number of parasites found per eel 
were higher in both BDD treatments. Concentrations of TRO as low as 0.06 mg/l Cl2 are known to 
negatively affect gill morphology (Reiser et al., 2010). Although interactio ns between parasites and 
residual oxidants are unknown, it might be that gills damaged by TRO are more susceptible to 
parasites.  
 
5. Conclusion  
 
Based on the present study effects on TOC removal are comparable between ozonation and BDD 
treatment. In contr ast to ozonation BDD treatment reduces ortho -phosphate accumulation, however 
this is of minor importance to fish health or growth. The formation of chlorate, bromate and other 
residual oxidants is a serious risk for both biofilter and fish performance, and  is limiting the 
application of BDD electrodes in fresh water RAS. Furthermore the formation of limestone on 
electrodes, thereby changing current densities and effectiveness of BDD treatment is a serious problem 
limiting the practicality of BDD treatment i n RAS. With respect to systems tested during the present 
study ozonation has clearly benefits over BDD treatment. However end -of-the-pipe treatment, where 
residual oxidant formation is not a limiting factor, might be an cheap and effective way to reduce 
nutrient emissions from fresh water RAS.

 General discussion  
 
Effects of inorganic waste accumulation in RAS on fish health and performance.  
 
The a ccumulation of metabolites in RAS  
Fish production in land based recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) is characterised by a trend 
towards intensification of water re -use (Blancheton et al., 2007).  Due to excretion of metabolics by 
fish and leachning of n utrients from spilled feed and faeces ‘inert’ substances such as nitrate, ortho -
phosphate and metals originating from make -up water and feed accumulate in the culture water. These 
substances are suggested as possible cause for negative effects on fish prod uction performance  
(Davidson et al., 2009, Davidson et al., 2011,  Deviller et al., 2005,  Martins et al., 2009, Martins et al 
2011) . However the the causal  effects of many of these substances are still unknown.  
 
Nitrate  toxicity  is generally considered as l ow to fresh water fish (Camargo et al., 2005),  and 
especially to marine fish (Brownell, 1980) h owever  findings in  chapter 1 suggest the opposite.  
The effect of elevated nitrate levels in the culture water on the performance and health of a marine 
fish, the  turbot ( Psetta maxima ) was studied. A negative linear relation between any concentration of 
nitrate applied (125, 250 or 500 mg / l NO 3-N) and growth was observed. Although effects on health 
were only considered significant for the two highest treatments (250 and 500 mg/l), the most sensitive 
parameters such as the relative spleen size and survival were also slightly affected at the 125 mg/l 
NO 3-N treatment. These effects on growth and health indicate that there is not a safety limit or 
threshold, the opti mum for fish culture is 0 mg/l NO 3-N. The same e ffects can also be observed by  two 
other studies done on marine cultured species that focused on growth ( Frankes and Hoff, 198 2, Kuhn 
et al., 2010). Nitrate does convert hemoglobin into methemoglobin, and sim iltanously the reductase 
systems converts methemoglobin back to hemoglobin. No differences in methemoglobin levels were 
observed suggesting that turbot are capable of maintaining hoemostasis. The reduced growth 
performance and negative effects on health at  any nitrate concentration can  thus be explained by 
energetic costs to maintain homeostasis  by converting and excreting the up -taken nitrate.  This 
increased energy costs are not co mpensated by extra feed intake as voluntary feed intake declined. 
Furthermor e the decreased feed conversion efficiency and reduced health are other indicators for an 
increased energy demand for detoxification to maintain homeostasis.  
 
Ortho -phosph ate is not considered toxic to fish, however in natural water concentrations found i n 
natural waters are a fraction of concentrations found in intensive RAS. Thus in chapter 2 the effect of 
elevated phosphate levels (25, 50 and 75 mg/l OP 4-P) in the culture water on performance a nd health 
of turbot was studied. No indications of ortho -phosphate toxicity on the health status of turbot were  
observed. Production performance was neither negatively affected by ortho -phosphate, however a 135 
 slightly improved growth was observed at moderate elevated ortho -phosphate levels. When turbot 
were fed a low  phosphorus diet , growth rates were significantly improved by the elevated water ortho -
phosphate concentrations. The improved growth was a result of increased feed intake, but not of 
increased feed conversion efficiency. However a trend was found for incre ased fat content in the 
control group and increased protein retention efficiency in the elevated ortho -phosphate  treatments. 
Other studies on effects of phosphate on fish performance in marine water are lacking. A recent study 
with a fresh water fish speci es showed that elevated phosphate levels do not increase voluntary feed 
intake but do reduce metabolic costs resulting in higher feed efficiencies (Eding et al., 2012). This 
suggests that turbot can uptake and utilize ortho -phosphate from the culture water  and thereby 
increases voluntary feed intake.  
 
Like nitrate  and phosphate,  trace metals are considered as relatively low toxic  in existing 
concentrations but effects on fish are only studied in fresh water species. Thus in chapter 3 the effect 
of the eleva ted concentrations of the five main dietary trace metals (Fe, Zn, Cu, Co and Mn) on the 
performance and health of turbot was studied. Fe levels showed a quick decrease in the culture water, 
due to oxidation and successive precipitation. Manganese showed a slower breakdown and 
precipitation. Other trace metals were relatively stable over time, although observed copper 
concentrations were much lower as nominal concentrations; the remaining trace  metals concentrations 
were comparable with nominal concentration s. Fish growth or feed efficiency was not affected by any 
elevated level of metals, neither was health  affected . However significant relations between exposure 
and body concentrations of Zn, Mn and Co were observed. Furthermore it was observed that with 
increased metal accumulation  the dry matter content of the body decreased. This suggest that turbot do 
uptake and incorporate these trace metals from water into their body, and consequently compensate by 
incorporating extra water in the muscle tissue. The re lation between water exchange rates and heavy 
metal concentrations in the body is also observed by other authors in both fresh and marine species 
(Deviller et al., 2005, Martins et al., 2011) but proximate body composition was not determined. 
However the i ncreased incorporation of water, resulting in a decreased dry matter and caloric content, 
is also a known effect of exposure of fish to aquatic metals ( Belanger et al., 1986 ). Toxic 
concentrations of Zn, Mn and Co to fish are relatively equal  (Taylor et al ., 1985 , Partridge and 
Lymbery, 2009 , Diamond et al., 1992). However requirements of fish for Zinc are a factor 5 -50 higher 
compared to manganese respectively cobalt  requirments , and observed concentrations in the diets was 
even a factor 30 -500 higher. Con sequently Zinc is potentially the metal that can become first toxic in 
marine RAS and should  be monitored carefully when marine RAS production is very intensive.  
 
  136 
 Limitations on the  intensification of RAS  
 
To reduce the potential for the accumulation of  nitrate, phosphate and trace minerals feed formulation 
should be optimized for RAS. A high digestability of the feed combined with a high retention 
efficiency  of nutrients  reduces the potential  or waste production. This is desirable for any aquaeed, but 
is of specific interest in RAS production . Nitrogen, phosphorus and the trace metals are the main 
inorganics that are suspected to affect fish performance.   
For turbot RAS operating at water exchange rates at around 4 00 liter make up water per kg feed  
appli ed, theoretical  nitrate -nitrogen levels will be around 125 mg/l. At this level negative effects on 
turbot growth were observed. With respect to ortho -phosphate, turbot RAS operating at water 
exchange levels as low as 50 liter make up water per kg feed appl ied, theoretical ortho -phosphate 
levels will be around 75 mg/l. This was the highest level tested and no negative effects on growth were 
observed. With respect to trace minerals, at water exchange levels as low as 10 liter make up water per 
kg feed applied  no negative effects on growth were observed. Thus f rom these inorganics , nitrate is 
most liming fish performance in RAS production .  
Nitrate removal is thus, after the nitrification process and solids removal, first priority in intensive 
marine RAS produc tion. However the linear relationship between nitrate and growth suggest that 
nitrate concentration and should be kept as low as possible. Costs for deni trification and  costs for 
water exchange should be balanced for optimal RAS management. Feed formulatio n should also be 
balanced between extra costs for optimal protein retention and less costs due to nitrate removal/water 
consumption decrease. In contrast o rtho-phosphate is not limiting growth at any levels which would be 
relevant in RAS. Ortho -P does have  positive effects  on fish performance  and should therefore 
preferably not be removed in the system water , but in the discharge water so called end-of-the-pipe 
treatment . Trace minerals do not effect growth or health and are therefore less relevant. However  the 
reduced dry matter content in the fish and the high potential for zinc to reach toxic levels are reasons 
to optimize retention of metals in fish, to minimize accumulation and to monitor metal concentrations 
in very intensive marine RAS.  
 
  137 
 The effect  of BDD electrodes on water quality in RAS  
 
In chapters 4, 5 and 6 the effects of BDD electrodes on organic accumulation, in -organic accumulation 
and disinfection were studied. Several forms of oxidized forms of chloride  and bromide were 
determined, common ly called disinfection by -products. This disinfection by products form serious 
limitations on the use of BDD electrodes, and are a serious disadvantage compared to ozone.  
 
 
The formation of disinfection by -products  on BDD electrodes  
In the present studies in both in fresh and marine water significant amounts of TRO were produced on 
the BDD electrodes. These TRO are formed simultaneously with hydroxyl radicals, because chloride 
in the water is oxidized to chlorine gas and bromide to bromine gas. Due to diffe rent equilibriums and 
follow up reaction, as discussed in chapter 6, hypobromous acid is the main form in seawater and 
hypo chlorous  acid in fresh waters (Echardt and Kornmueller, 2009). The formation of TRO after BDD 
electrolysation is inevitable and is de pendent on current density and salinity (Diaz et al., 2011, Echardt 
and Kornmueller 2009, Bergmann and Rollin, 2007). Such TRO are very harmful to fish and shrimp 
(Reiser et al., 2010, Schroeder et al., 2010). Furthermore it was observed that these TRO are  relatively 
stable and do accumulate.  In contrast ozone  produced TRO have  a tendenc y for a quicker breakdown , 
and thus the rate of TRO accumulation is less. Differences in TRO stability are caused by the fact that 
BDD electrodes are less selective and can oxidize any ion present (e.g. bromide, chloride, ammonia), 
while ozone prefers the oxidation of bromide (Schroeder et al., 2011).  The accumulation of these 
TRO produced by BDD electrodes was observed in small scaled RAS in both fresh water (chapter 6) 
and marine water (chapter 4) but also by other authors (Diaz et al., 2011). Even in a commercial scaled 
RAS with a hydraulic retention time of 4.5 hours (chapter 5) TRO accumulated. This means that, in 
contrast to drink ing water  or ballastwater treatment, app lied doses is limited by the amount of TRO 
directly  produced and the amount of remaining  TRO in the culture water. Minimation of TRO 
formation is thus the keypoint for safe and effective use of BDD electrodes. Low current efficiencies 
for TRO formation wer e found in the range between 0 and 30 A/m². Further research should focus on 
such low current densities to oxidize waste products in RAS without the accumulation of  TRO and 
other  disinfection by -products.  138 
 Besides  the formation of hypobromous and hypochlor ous acid ( measured as TRO) , production of  the 
persistant by -products  bromate and chlorate was observed in the fresh water experiment (chapter 6). In 
contrast ozonation did not result in any bromate or chlorate formation. In marine water (chapter 4 and 
5) bromate and chlorate were not measured due to analytical limitations; however other studies 
suggest that formation of perch lorate, chlorate and bromate increase with salinity (Echardt and 
Kornmueller, 2009) Although chlorate and bromate are not acute  toxic to fish, they have been proven 
to be toxic to algae and bacteria ( van Wijk  and Hutchinson, 1995 ) which cause adverse effects on 
biofiltration as was observed in chapter 6. However minimizing TRO formation by only applying low 
current densities might also b e a strategy to reduce the accumulation of perchlorate, chlorate and 
bromate.  
Although not directly measured during the present studies, ion balances (chapter 6) suggest the 
production of significant amounts of chlorinated and brominated or ganics, when aq uaculture water is  
treated with BDD electrodes. These products are formed when organics are present, and bromoform is 
the major form present  (Echardt and Kornmueller, 2009, Diaz et al., 201 1). In contrast ozonation did 
not suggest any formation of bromofor m or chloroform. Although not as acute toxic as hypobromous 
or hypochlorous acid, b romoform and chloroform affect fish and bacteria  at relevant low 
concentrations  (Gibson et al., 1979 ). Therefore negative interactions on fish and biofilter performance 
can be expected. Further research is needed to investigate if bromoform formation can also be 
minimized by applying only low current densities  
 
Waste conversion by BDD electrodes  
Although the dose of oxidants was limited by TRO formation, BDD treatment did als o decrease the 
accumulation of some waste products in RAS. Organics, in the present study measured as dissolved 
colored organic matter (DCOM) and total organic carbon  (TOC) , was significantly reduced by BDD 
treatment. Similar findings, COD reduction, both in fresh and marine aquaculture water have been 
reported in literature (Feng et al., 2003, Diaz et al., 2011). For RAS production this means that based 
on organics, water quality can be improved and water consumption can be reduced. However it might 
be tha t BDD treatment, like ozonation improves the removal of small particulate matter due to 
improve coagulation. To reveal the full potential for BDD electrodes in RAS, the combination of BDD 
treatment and mechanical treatment of the water needs further invest igations . 
Besided the removal of organics , BDD treatment reduced concentrations of ortho -phosphate  in the 
culture water . This process is also observed in another study (Feng et al., 2003) but mechanism of 
removal remain s unclear. Binding/coagulation with o ther molecules, followed by precipitation or 
mechanical filtration might be a possible pathway. However , based on finding in chapter 2, 
orthophosphate accumulation is not a factor limiting water exchange  rates  in RAS systems.  
Effects of BDD treatment on ni trogen compounds  were observed in the several pre -studies. BDD 
treatment oxides nitrite to nitrate, but both ammonia and nitrate levels are unaffected. This is in 139 
 contrast to other studies w hich described  nitrogen removal due to nitrogen gas formation (Kra ft et al., 
2003, Georgeaud et al., 2011, Diaz et al., 2011). However in these studies applied currents  were not 
limited by TRO formation and thus processes such as breakpoint chlorination and anodic nitrate 
reduction can effectively take place. As was seen revealed  during the present long term experiments 
these processes could not be observed  during the safe application in RAS . Further stud ies are needed  
to see if electrochemical nitrogen removal is a safe and cost effective alternative to biological 
denitri fication is needed.      
 
Disinfection  with BDD electrodes  
In our pre-experiments as well as in previous studies (Echardt and Kornmueller, 2009) significant 
disinfection effects were found using BDD electrodes . Due to their high reactivity , hydroxyl radica ls 
react very fast with any substance present in the water, resulting in a low, contact time between 
pathogen and hydroxyl radicals. Therefore it is  rateher the more persistant secondary oxidants than the   
hydroxyl radical s that enable  effective disinfecti on (Furuta et al. 2005 ). As discussed above these by -
products are the main drawback of BDD electrodes in RAS and should be minimized. Consequently in 
both fresh and marine water, no effective disinfection performance was observed for bacterial counts 
under  practical RAS circumstances. Furthermore in all three studies disinfection took place in a by -
pass, therefore not the whole water flow was disinfected. For effective disinfection the whole water 
flow should be treated to avoid mixing of disinfected and no n-treated water. Furthermore biofilm 
formation on the electrodes was observed, and the formed biofilm served as  substrate for bacterial 
growth and  bacterial densities of 4.4*107 CFU / cm² were observed, making the BDD electrodes a 
source of bacteria. This might also partly explain the high standard deviations observed in bacterial 
disinfection  experiments . 
 
Usability and energ y costs  of BDD electrodes  
The energetic costs to treat water with BDD electrodes is low, and is mainly dependent on the energy 
use by  the transformer. The electrical power consumed  by the Ectosys system to treat a 45 m³ RAS 
was only 8 Watt (1 A * 8 V)  but was limited by TRO formation . Electrochemical treatment of RAS 
water is therefore considered to be  very low in energy consumption. Ho wever in all three studies, both 
in fresh and marine water, formation of limestone was observed within hours. Because limestone 
formation changes the actual electrode surface it will change applied current densities and thus TRO 
formation. As a result elec trodes should be cleaned intensively to maintain optimal current densities. 
When done manual this is labour intensive. Furthermore after continues use, in all types of electrodes 
used and in both fresh and marine water damage of the diamond layer on the el ectrodes could be 
observed. Like limestone formation, a reduction of the diamond surface will change the actual current 
density applied, and will quickly decrease the maximal doses of oxidants applied to keep TRO levels 140 
 within limits set. For continues eff ective working diamonds, a constant renewal of the diamond layer 
is needed.  
 
Is BDD treatment an alternative for ozonation in RAS?  
BDD treatment in RAS can be a way to decrease organic load and ortho -phosphate concentrations in 
RAS. However the formation of stabile TRO, perchlorate, chlorate, bromate and chlorinated and 
brominated organics is a major drawback compared to much lower formation of such byproducts 
during ozonation. Keeping applied current densities low might be a way to minimize the formation of 
these unwanted by -products. Consequently this means that a large area of diamond is needed which 
increase investment costs. The formation of limestone, requiring constant maintenance is a second 
drawback compared to ozonation. The low power consumption is a benefit compared to ozonation, 
however the deterioration of the diamond layer means a constant additional operating costs.

 Summary  
 
To reduce water and energy consumption in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) there is a trend 
over the last years to reduce water exchange levels. Due to this reduction in water exchange several 
substances accumulate in the system water . The most important inorganic  water compounds originally  
are applied by the feed and are nitrate, orthophosphate and the trace elements iron (Fe), zi nc (Zn), 
copper (Cu), manganese (Mn) and cobalt (Co). The effects of these inorganics in the culture water on 
marine fish species are unknown. Therefore, in the first part of this thesis, the effects of these 
inorganics on growth, feed utilization and seve ral health parameters of a marine fish species, the turbot 
(Psetta maxima ) were studied.  
  
In 12 independent  RAS nitrate levels were artificially  increased. In a dose -response study the effects 
of four different nitrate levels on the performance of juvenil e turbot were evaluated . It was observed 
that the v oluntary feed intake  was negative ly affect ed by elevated nitrate -nitrogen concentrations in 
the range of 125-500 mg/l NO 3-N compared to a control treatment at 4 mg/l NO 3-N. Effects on fish 
health were only  observed above 125 mg/l NO 3-N and included increased mortality and increased 
spleen size.  Blood parameters were not affected , suggesting that turbot are capable of keeping 
homeostasis up to 500 mg/l NO 3-N, although this increased  energetic demands .  
Next to nitrogen compounds  other accumulating substances possibly  affect the growth  performance  of 
turbot. In a second dose -response study the effect of ortho -phosphate on production performance  
parameter  and health  parameter  of juvenile turbot was studied. It was found that e levated ortho -
phosphate concentrations d id not negatively affect health and growth of turbot in RAS. Neither 
voluntary feed intake nor health is negative ly affect ed by elevated ortho -phosphate concentrations in 
the range of 3 -75 mg/l PO 4-P. However fish cultured under ortho -p concentrations of 25 mg/l showed 
a tendency for higher feed intake and growth compared to the control groups. When fed a low -P diet 
growth at elevated ortho -p concentrations (25 mg/l), growth  was significantly higher co mpare to a 
control, suggesting that turbot are capable of taking up and utilize waterborne phosphorus.  
This resulted in the hypothesis that turbot are capable to absorb  trace elements from the culture water, 
which was tested in another study.  In detail  the effects of the accumulation of the elements  Fe, Zn, Cu, 
Co, Mn and Co in the culture water on turbot were evaluated. In 5 individual RAS the accumulation of 
these metals at 5 different water exchange rates (between 1000 and 10 l/kg feed) were simulated, a nd 
effects on turbot performance and health were studied. It was observed that t he accumulation of metals 
(Fe, Zn, Cu, Co, Mn) did  not negatively affect turbot growth up to water exchange rates as low as 10 
l/kg feed applied. However Zn, Co and Mn bioaccum ulate in turbot resulting in decreased dry matter 
content. Based on the concentration observed in a commercial  RAS and in commercial turbot diets , Zn 
is the most important parameter which should be monitored when turbot is raised  in intensive RAS . 
 144 
 In the second part of this thesis water treatment to reduce accumulating substances and disinfection at 
low water exchange rates was investigated. S o called Boron Doped Diamonds (BDD) electrodes are 
artificial diamond electrodes that are applied in wastewater -, drinking water - and ballast water -
treatment. These BDD electrodes are used to remove organic and inorganics, such as nitrates, 
phosphates and trace metals. Furthermore BDD electrodes are used to disinfect drinking water  and 
wastewater. Until  now it was unknown if BDD electrodes also could be applied in RAS.    
In a fourth experiment  it was observed that  in small scaled RAS,  concentrations of total organic 
carbon (TOC), colored dissolved organic matter (DCOM) and orthophosphate could be reduced  by 
BDD treatment . The concentration of total residual oxidants (TRO) could be kept below critical 
concentrations for turbot. However due to the production and accumulation of these TRO the applied 
current on the electrodes was limited, reducing the disinf ection  potential. An effective disinfection was 
possible but will directly lead to fish critical TRO concentrations. In comparison  to BDD treatment, 
conventional ozonation resulted in a higher reduction of TOC and CDOM, but not to orthophosphate 
removal. Additionally  an effective disinfection  was not rea lized by ozonation , due to TRO formation .   
In a fifth experiment BDD electrodes were tested in a commercial scaled RAS. Also here a  reduction 
of TOC and orthophosphate could be  observed , compared to a contr ol treatment. However , 
accordingly to the small scaled RAS, TRO formation was limiting the applied current and 
consequently an effective disinfection.  
The last experiment in fresh water small -scaled RAS showed that, also in fresh water, BDD treatment 
led to a reduced accumulation of TOC and ortho -phosphate compared to a control treatment. In 
accordance to  marine water , also in fresh water the formation of TRO was limiting the applied dose 
and thus the disinfection  performance. The removal of TOC was on a comparable  level  between 
ozonation and BDD treatment, but no orthophosphate removal during ozonation was observed.  
In all three experiments it was observed that the accumulation of organics and inorganics can be 
reduced by BDD treatment without exceeding fi sh critical TRO concentrations. However the 
formation of these TRO, which are stable and accumulate in the culture water,  is limiting the 
application of BDD electrodes in RAS. Furthermore the accumulation of perchlorate, chlorate, 
bromate, and chlorinated and brominated organics is a serious drawback for the use of BDD electrodes 
in RAS. By applying low current densities formation of these by -products can be minimized. Due to 
the formation of stabile TRO , low current densities  must be applied. Consequently effective 
disinfection  is not possible by safe application. Effective disinfection is possible, however this will 
result immediately in fish toxic  TRO concentrations.  
Electrical energy consumption for the oxidation of waste products on BDD electrodes is ve ry low and 
most energy is consumed by the transformer. In this way BDD treatment can be a cheap and efficient 
way of removing waste products from RAS. However because current densities must be kept low, 
large diamond surfaces are needed resulting in high i nvestment costs. By applying continues current 
on the BDD electrodes a rapid buildup (within hours) of limestone and biofilm was observed. This 145 
 biofilm was found to be a substrate for bacterial growth, but more important the limestone reduced the 
available  surface for oxidation of waste products. As a result current density will increase leading to 
increased formation of TRO. Furthermore after continuous use for two to four weeks clear 
deterioration of the diamond surface was observed.  Besides optimization of BDD electrocell 
adjustment  further studies should focus on reduction  of TRO formation  to obtain effective removal 
without exceeding fish toxic  TRO concentrations. Furthermore possibilities for the electrochemical 
reduction of nitrate with BDD electrodes  could be a cost effective way to enhance RAS productivity.

 Zusammenfassung  
 
Um den Einsatz von Energie und Wasser in Kreislaufanlagen (KLA) in der kommerziellen Fischzucht 
zu optimieren, gibt es den Trend die Wasseraustauschraten in KLA weiter zu minim ieren. Durch diese 
Reduktion akkumulieren verschiedene Substanzen im Produktionswasser. Die wichtigsten 
anorganischen Substanzen, die sich in KLA akkumulieren, werden über das Futter eingetragen und 
sind Nitrat, Orthophosphat und die Spurelemente Eisen (Fe ), Zink (Zn), Kupfer (Cu), Mangan (Mn) 
und Cobalt (Co). Wie sich diese Substanzen auf marine Fischarten auswirken ist weitestgehend 
unbekannt. Die Erfassung und Beurteilung dieser Substanzen im Systemwasser stellen den 
Ausgangspunkt der Untersuchungen dar.  In dem ersten Teil der vorliegenden Arbeit wurden die 
Effekte dieser anorganischen Substanzen auf Wachstum, Futterverwertung und verschiedene 
gesundheitsrelevante Parameter einer marinen Fischart, demSteinbutt ( Psetta maxima ) untersucht.    
 
So wurde in e iner ersten Dosis -Wirkungsstudie der Einfluss der Nitratkonzentration auf das Wachstum 
juveniler Steinbutt in 12 separaten KLA untersucht. Es konnte festgestellt werden, dass die freiwillige 
Futteraufnahme durch erhöhte Nitrat -Konzentrationen bereits ab ei ner Konzentration von 125 mg/l 
NO 3-N im Vergleich zu einer Kontrollbehandlung mit nur 4 mg/l NO 3-N negativ beeinflusst wird. Der 
Gesundheitsstatus der Fische, gemessen an den Parametern Sterblichkeit sowie relative Größe der 
Milz, war bereits bei einer Kon zentration von 125 mg/l NO 3-N negativ beeinflusst. Da gemessene 
Blutparameter bis zu einer Konzentration von 500 mg/l NO 3-N unbeeinflusst waren, ist davon 
auszugehen, dass der Steinbutt in der Lage ist, die Homöostase trotz hoher energetischer Kosten  
aufre cht zu erhalten.  
Neben Abbauprodukten des Stickstoffs, haben noch weitere Nährstoffe und chemische Elemente 
Einfluss auf das Wachstum und die Gesundheit von insbesondere in Kreislaufanlagen kultivierten 
Fischen. In einer weiteren Dosis -Wirkungsstudie wurd e der Einfluss des  Abbauprodukts 
Orthophosphat in 4 Stufen mit jeweils 3 Replikaten auf Leistungs - und Gesundheitsparameter am 
Steinbutt untersucht. Bei einer Erhöhung der Orthophosphat -Konzentrationen von 3 auf 75 mg/l PO 4-P  
wurden keine negativen Auswir kungen auf gemessene Gesundheitsparameter festgestellt. Allerdings 
zeigten Fische, die bei einer Konzentrationen von 25 mg/l PO 4-P kultiviert wurden, eine Tendenz zur 
gesteigerten Futteraufnahme einhergehend mit höherem Wachstum im Vergleich zu den 
Kontrol lgruppen. Bei der Verabreichung einer Phosphor -limitierten Diät, in Kombination mit einer 
erhöhten Orthophosphat -Konzentration (25 mg/ l), war das Wachstum signifikant höher als in der 
Kontrollgruppe. Diese Ergebnisse belegen, dass der Steinbutt Orthophosp hat aus dem Wasser 
absorbieren und metabolisieren kann.  
Die daraus resultierenden Hypothesen zur Absorption von anorganischen Mikronährstoffen aus dem 
Systemwasser wurden in einer weiteren Studie überprüft. Hierbei wurde der Einfluss von 
akkumulierenden Me tallen (Fe, Zn, Cu, Co, Mn) auf Produktionsparameter beim Steinbutt untersucht. 147 
 In fünf KLA wurde die Akkumulation dieser Metalle für fünf verschiedenen Wasseraustauschraten 
(zwischen 1000 und 10 l/kg Futter) simuliert, und der Effekt auf Leistungs - und Ge sundheitsparameter 
am Steinbutt untersucht. Es konnte festgestellt werden, dass keine Bioakkumulation von Cu und Fe im 
Steinbutt erfolgt. Allerdings wurden Zn, Co und Mn aus dem Wasser aufgenommen und im Körper 
akkumuliert, und führten außerdem zu einer ge ringeren Trockenmasse des Steinbutts.  Basierend auf 
der Konzentration dieser Spurenelemente im Wasser und in kommerziellen Futtermitteln, sowie der 
Funktionalität dieser Elemente in biochemischen Prozessen im Metabolismus des Fisches, kann Zink 
die größte  Bedeutung zugesprochen werden und sollte in intensiv geführten marinen KLA überwacht 
werden.  
 
Die sogenannte Bor -dotierte Diamant (BDD) Elektrode ist eine künstlich produzierte Elektrode, die in 
Abwasser -, Ballastwasser - und Trinkwasserbehandlung eingese tzt wird. Sie dient der Entfernung 
verschiedener organischer Substanzen, sowie der Entfernung unterschiedlicher anorganischer 
Substanzen, wie u.a. Nitrat, Phosphat und Metallen. Außerdem werden BDD Elektroden zur  
Desinfektion von  Trinkwasser und Ballastw asser angewendet. Potential und Grenzen dieser BDD 
Elektroden für den Einsatz in der kreislaufgeführten Aquakultur sind bislang nahezu unerforscht und 
stellen den Fokus des zweiten Teils dieser Arbeit dar.  
In einem vierten Versuch in marinen  kleinskalige n KLA konnte gezeigt werden, dass die 
Konzentration von Gesamt - organischem  Kohlenstoff (TOC) und gelösten organischen Substanzen 
(CDOM) sowie Orthophosphat durch den Einsatz der BDD -Elektroden im Vergleich zu einer 
unbehandelten Kontrolle deutlich verrin gert werden kann.. Die Bildung von Restoxidantien (Total 
residual oxidants - TRO) konnte hierbei unterhalb der für Steinbutt kritischen Höhe gehalten werden.  
Das Desinfektionspotential der BDD -Elektroden scheint jedoch durch die Dosis -limitierende Bildung 
toxischer Restoxidantien stark begrenzt zu sein. Eine effektivere Desinfektion ist möglich, diese führt 
jedoch direkt zu einer für Fische kritischen TRO Konzentration. Im Vergleich zur BDD -Behandlung 
resultierte die konventionelle Ozonisierung zu einem erh öhten Abbau von TOC und CDOM, nicht 
aber von Orthophosphat. Eine effektive Desinfektion war auch hier limitiert durch TRO -
Akkumulation im Prozesswasser.  
 Unter Verwendung einer marinen KLA im Technikumsmaßstab konnten in einem fünften Versuch 
die bereits a ufgezeigten Effekte auch für den kommerziellen Maßstab verifiziert werden. Die BDD -
bedingte Reduktion von TOC und Orthophosphat fiel sogar höher als bei konventioneller 
Ozonisierung aus. Zudem bestätigte sich die stetige Anreicherung von TRO, welche wieder um die 
Effizienz der Desinfektion einschränkte.  
Ein sechster Versuch in kleinskaligen Süßwasser -KLA zeigte, dass die Konzentrationen von TOC und 
Orthophosphat auch in Süßwasser deutlich verringert werden konnten, wenn das Systemwasser mit 
der BDD -Elektrod e behandelt wurde. Aber auch im Süßwasser limitierte die Bildung von TRO den 
Einsatz der Elektrode und die Desinfektionsleistung. Der Abbau von TOC mittels Ozonisierung war 148 
 gleichwertig zur BDD -Behandlung, obwohl der Abbau von Orthophsophat mittels BDD eff ektiver 
war.    
In allen 3 Versuchen wurde gezeigt, dass sowohl organische als auch anorganische Substanzen 
deutlich reduziert werden können, ohne kritische TRO -Werte zu überschreiten. Da die Bildung dieser 
TRO kontinuierlich verläuft und stets neue TRO ge bildet werden, limitiert dies die Anwendung der 
BDD -Elektroden in KLA. Zudem ist die Entstehung von Perchlorat, Chlorat, Bromat, sowie chlorierte 
und bromierte organische Verbindungen ein stark limitierender Faktor für die Verwendung von BDD -
Elektroden in KLA. Nur der Einsatz geringer Stromdichten kann die Bildung dieser Nebenprodukte 
begrenzen. Der sichere Einsatz bei ausreichender Desinfektion ist somit nur begrenzt möglich. Eine 
weitere Erhöhung der Desinfektionsleistung führt umgehend zu einem Anstieg d er TRO -Werte und 
damit zu Fisch -kritischen Konzentration. Die elektrische Energie, die für die Oxidation der 
Abfallprodukte in der BDD Elektrode benötigt wird, ist sehr gering, und wird überwiegend vom 
Transformator verbraucht. Somit stellt die Desinfektio n von Systemwasser mit der BDD Elektrode 
eine Betriebskosten -günstige Methode dar. Dementgegen stehen hohe Investitionskosten einer 
Diamantbeschichtung großer Elektrodenflächen, um auch bei geringen Stromdichten effektive 
Leistungen erreichen zu können. Be im Stromfluss durch die BDD Elektrode kommt es binnen weniger 
Stunden zur Bildung eines Biofilms und Kalksteins auf dem Diamantträger. Die Bildung des 
Kalksteins verringert die für die Oxidation von Abfallprodukten nötige Oberfläche entscheidend. 
Diese ger ingere Diamantfläche führt zu einer Erhöhung der Stromdichte, welche wiederum die 
Bildung der TRO steigert. Die Diamantfläche in der BDD Elektrode war nach einem Einsatz von 2 bis 
4 Wochen deutlich abgenutzt.  
Der Einsatz von BDD Elektroden sollte dennoch weiterhin mit dem Ziel der Verringerung der sich 
bildenden TRO Werte untersucht werden. Außerdem wird empfohlen die elektrochemische Reduktion 
von Nitrat mittels BDD Elektroden weiter zu optimieren, da die Akkumulation des Nitrats größte 
Auswirkungen auf d ie Produktivität mariner KLA besitzt.  149

Gerard and Anny , my parents,  thanks for your support  over all the years. Gerard , I still remember the 
Friday afternoons at Stanislas w here we had to come togheter and discuss my future! Anny , I also still 
remember very well the  moment  when you advised me, friendly but urgent, to visit Wageningen  and 
inform mysel f about ‘the study with fish’ . Luckily in the end everthing turned out well and with your 
support I fishished my high school,  masters  and PhD.  
  
Saskia, my schatje , thank you for taking me to Germany. Without your support I would have never 
managed t o write this thesis  and how to survive all the other Germans .
