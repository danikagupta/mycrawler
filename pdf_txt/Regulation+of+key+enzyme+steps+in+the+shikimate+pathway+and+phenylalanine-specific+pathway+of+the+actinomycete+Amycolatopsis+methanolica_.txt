99Prephenate dehydratase (PDT), chorismate mutase (CM) and 3-deoxy-D- arabino -7-
heptulosonate 7-phosphate (DAHP) synthase are key regulatory enzymes in aromatic 
amino acid biosynthesis in the actinomycete Amycolatopsis methanolica . Deregulated, 
feedback control resista nt mutants were isolated by incubation of A. methanolica  on 
glucose mineral agar containing the toxic analogue para -fluoro-DL-phenylalanine 
(pFPhe). Several of these mutants had complete ly lost PDT sensitivity to Phe inhibition 
and Tyr activation. Mutant characterization yielded new information about PDT amino 
acid residues involved in Phe and Tyr effector binding sites.   
A. methanolica wild type cells grown on glucose mineral medium normally possess 
a bi-functional CM/DAHP-synthase protein complex (with DS1, a plant type DAHP-
synthase). The CM activity of this protein co mplex is feedback inhibited by Tyr and Phe, 
while DS1 activity is mainly inhibited by Trp.  Isolation of pFPhe res istant mutants yielded 
two feedback inhibition resi stant CM mutants. These were characterized as regulatory 
mutants, de-repressed in (a) synthesis of CM , now occurring as an abundant, feedback 
inhibition resistant, separate protein, and (b) synthesis of an alternative DAHP-synthase 
(DS2, an E. coli  type DAHP-synthase), only inhibite d by Tyr and Trp. DS1 and DS2 thus 
are well integrated in A. methanolica  primary metabolism: DS1 and CM form a protein 
complex, which stimulates CM activity and rend ers it sensitive to feedback inhibition by 
Phe and Tyr. Synthesis of CM and DS2 protei ns appears to be controlled co-ordinately, 
sensitive to Phe mediated feedback repression.  
Introduction 
In microorganisms and plants the biosynthes is of aromatic com pounds proceeds via the 
common seven-step aromatic or shikimate pathway to the branch point intermediate chorismate. 
This intermediate is subsequently converted to the three aromatic amino acids via specific 
terminal pathways (Fig. 1). Many other (aromatic) compounds are derived either partially or entirely from chorismate or from other pathway intermediates or end products, e.g. 
pyrroloquinoline quinone, lignin, ubiquinone, plastiquinone, enterochelin, vitamin K and 3-
amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid, the precursor of the mC
7N units found in mitomycin and 
ansamycin antibiotics (Bentley, 1990;Knaggs, 1999;Arakawa et al. , 2002). Aromatic amino acid 
biosynthesis in bacteria is strictly regulated via feedback control mechanisms. Limited information is available abou t these enzymes or their regulation in actinomycetes, Gram-
positive bacteria that are well-known producers of  numerous antibiotics derived from aromatic 
amino acids or their pathway intermediates (Hodgson, 2000). Antibiotic biosynthesis may require specific metabolic adaptations, e.g. ex pression of isoenzymes that serve to avoid 
feedback regulation by aromatic amino acids. 
We are interested in the enzymology and regulation of aromatic amino acid 
biosynthesis in the no cardioform actinomycete Amycolatopsis methanolica.  This bacterium is 
closely related to Amycolatopsis mediterranei , producing the antibiotic rifamycin via 3-amino-
5-hydroxybenzoic acid (Kim et al. , 1996a;Kim et al. , 1996b), and to Amycolatopsis orientalis , 
producing the glycopeptide antibiotics chloroeremomycin and vancomycin, containing for 
instance Tyr (van Wageningen AM et al. , 1998). Previous studies of aromatic amino acid 
biosynthesis in A. methanolica  have resulted in the isolation of a large number of auxotrophic 
mutants and the biochemical and molecular charact erization of several key regulatory enzymes 
(Euverink et al. , 1995a;Euverink et al. , 1995b;Vrijbloed et al. , 1995d;Euverink et al. , 1996). Chapter 7

The shikimate pathway and the Phe specific pa thway are controlled by three regulatory 
enzymes: 3-Deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate (DAHP)-synthase, chorismate mutase 
(CM) and prephenate dehydratase (PDT). DAHP-s ynthase, the first enzyme of the shikimate 
pathway, is responsible for the condensation of the pentose phosphate pathway intermediate D-erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P) and the glycolytic pathway intermediate phospho enolpyruvate 
(PEP) to DAHP. Carbon flow through the shikimate pathway, where tested in other microbes, is 
generally controlled by feedback inhibition of  DAHP-synthase activity and/or repression of 
DAHP-synthase synthesis. DAHP-synthase enzymes are present either as a monofunctional di- 
or tetrameric protein, e.g. in E. coli  (Ray and Bauerle, 1991;McCandliss et al. , 1978;Schoner 
and Herrmann, 1976), or as a bifunctional protein exhibiting both DAHP-synthase and CM activities, e.g. in Brevibacterium flavum  (Sugimoto and Shiio, 1980) and in A. methanolica  
(Euverink et al. , 1995a). Several organisms contain 2 or 3 isoenzymes  of DAHP-synthase, each 
displaying a specific feedback inhibition pattern.  
Based on their highly divergent primary st ructures, two DAHP-synthase families are 
distinguished. E. coli  type DAHP-synthase enzymes have only been found in microorganisms. 
Plant type DAHP-synthase proteins are mainly found in plants, but an increasing number of Figure 1.  Biosynthesis of

101these enzymes are found in bact eria, e.g. in the aurachin pr oducing Gram-neg ative bacterium 
Stigmatella aurantiaca  (Silakowski et al. , 2000), and in the phenazine biosynthetic gene cluster 
of Pseudomonas aureofaciens  (phzF ). It has been speculated that the phzF  gene product serves 
to bypass feedback inhibited DAHP-synthase protein(s) in Ps. aureofaciens  to ensure sufficient 
intracellular levels of chorismate for phenazine production (Pierson et al. , 1995). Plant type 
DAHP-synthase enzymes are also f ound in actinomycetes, e.g. the Streptomyces avermitilis  
(BAC73797) (Ikeda et al. , 2003)  and Streptomyces coelicolor  (P80574, CAB38581) (Bentley et 
al., 2002) genomes encode one and two (putative) plant type DAHP-synthase proteins, 
respectively. The Corynebacterium glutamicum  genome encodes single copies of both DAHP-
synthase protein families (BAB99571, BAB98383), similar to the rifamycin producer A. 
mediterranei  (AAK28148, AAC01718). The plant type DAHP-synthase encodi ng ORF, located 
in the rifamycin biosynthetic gene cluster, is involved in aminoDAHP synthesis (August et al. , 
1998). 
Biochemical studies already have shown that two DAHP-synthase isoenzymes and 
single CM and PDT enzymes are present in A. methanolica . DAHP-synthase 1 (DS1) is a 160 
kDa enzyme associated non-covalently with a dimeric CM protein, thus forming a heteromeric two-enzyme complex. Both enzyme activities can be separated with Q-sepharose anion-
exchange chromatography, yielding a dimeric CM protein with a 5-fold reduced activity that no 
longer is feedback inhibited by Phe and Ty r, and a 160 kDa DAHP-synthase, that is still 
feedback inhibition sensitive to its effectors Phe, Tyr and (most st rongly) Trp (Euverink et al. , 
1995a). 
 Characterization of a leaky Phe auxotrophic mutant (GH141) of A. methanolica 
revealed that it had lost 90% of the Phe aminotransferase activity, resulting in Phe-limited 
growth in mineral medium. Mutant GH141 expressed an additional Tyr-sensitive DAHP-
synthase activity (DS2), accompanied by a stro ngly elevated CM activity . In mutant GH141 the 
CM protein was not associated with DS1 activity, but occurred as a separate dimeric protein 
(Euverink et al. , 1995a). Supplementing Phe to the growth medium of GH141, restored wild 
type activity levels of both CM and DAHP-synthase. An ortho -fluoro-DL-phenylalanine 
resistant mutant (oFPhe83) subsequently was characterized that showed high levels of DS2 and 
dimeric CM activity, both in the presence and abse nce of Phe, suggesting a regulatory mutation 
that de-repressed the synthesis of both proteins (Euverink et al. , 1995a). Thus, whereas DS1 
activity is sensitive to Phe, Tyr and (most stro ngly) Trp feedback inhibition, DS2 activity is 
sensitive to Tyr feedback inhibition (but not Phe)  whereas its synthesis is sensitive to feedback 
repression mediated by Phe.  
Prephenate dehydratase (PDT) enzymes occur as monofunctional proteins in Gram-
positive bacteria or as bifunctional proteins (P-p roteins) in Gram-negative bacteria (Bentley, 
1990). PDT enzymes are generally sensitive to f eedback regulation by Phe and/or Tyr (Bentley, 
1990).  PDT of A. methanolica  is allosterically inhibited by Phe and activated by Tyr (De Boer et 
al., 1989;Euverink et al. , 1995b). Previously, we reported characterization of the A. methanolica  
pdt gene (Vrijbloed et al. , 1995d). 
Here we report the isolation and characterization of a number of spontaneous A. 
methanolica  PDT mutants insensitive to Phe feedback inhibition and Tyr feedback activation, 
providing new information about amino acid residues involved in PDT allosteric control. 
Furthermore, we report the molecular and bi ochemical characterization of a second DAHP-
synthase in A. methanolica and molecular characterization of both DAHP-synthases of  A. 
methanolica , revealing that this organism  contains a single representative of both currently 
recognized families of DAHP-synthase enzymes. We believe this to be the first report of a plant 
type DAHP-synthase that forms a protein complex with a CM, thereby stimulating CM activity and making it sensitive to feedback inhibition. Chapter 7 
 
  
102 Materials and methods 
Microorganisms, cultivation and DNA manipulations 
Amycolatopsis methanolica  wild-type (NCIB 11946) and derived phenylalanine analogue 
resistant mutants (this study) were cultivated as described (De Boer et al. , 1988). E. coli  strains 
DH5 α and BL21(DE3) were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (Ampicillin and 
Chloramphenicol, 100 µg/ml; IPTG, 0.5 mM) at 37oC and 30oC, respectively. Methods for 
DNA handling, modification and cloning were performed as in (Sambrook et al. , 1989).

Isolation of phenylalanine-analogue-resistant mutants  
A. methanolica  mutants resistant to toxic pFPhe (5 mg/ml, 32.8 mM) were isolated on 10 mM 
glucose mineral agar plates with filter-sterili zed analogue. Plates were inoculated with 
approximately 5 x 107 cells. After 5-7 days the spontaneously resistant colonies that had 
appeared were transferred to fresh agar plates with the same composition. 
 
Preparation of extracts and enzyme assays 
Cells were washed in buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5) and disrupted by three passages through 
a French Pressure cell at 140 MPa. Unbroken cells and debris were removed by centrifugation of the lysate at 40,000 g for 30 min at 4
oC and the supernatant was used for enzyme assays. 
Unless otherwise stated enzyme assays were performed at 37oC. 
PDT (EC 4.2.1.51) activity was assayed by measuring phenylpyruvate formation. The 
reaction mixture (0.5 ml) contained 1 mM potassium prephenate, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 and 
protein. At appropriate time intervals 0.5 ml of 2.0 M NaOH was added and the absorbance of 
phenylpyruvate was measured at 320 nm ( ε320[phenylpyruvate]= 17.5 *103 M-1.cm-1) (Patel et 
al., 1977). CM (EC 5.4.99.5) activity was assayed by measuring the amount of prephenate 
formed after its conversion to phenylpyruvate (Dopheide et al. , 1972). The reac tion mixture (0.1 
ml) contained 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.0 mM chorismate and protein. After 10 min, 10 µl 4.5 
M HCl was added and the reaction mixture was incubated for 15 min at 37oC. After addition of Regulation of the Phenyl alanine specific pathway 
 
 
103NaOH (890 µl of an1.58 M solution) the phenylpyruvate formed was determined at A 320. DAHP 
synthase (EC 2.5.1.54) activity was assayed as described (De Boer et al. , 1989). Phe, Tyr and 
Trp inhibition/activation of PDT, CM and DAHP synthase activity was determined in the presence of 1 mM of each amino acid (Euverink et al. , 1995a;Euverink et al. , 1995b).   
 
DNA sequence analysis 
Nucleotide sequencing was done using dye-primers in the cycle sequencing method (Murray, 
1989) with the thermosequenase kit RPN 2538  from Amersham Phar macia Biotech AB. The 
samples were run on the A.L.F-Express sequencing robot. Analysis of nucleotide sequence was done using CloneManager version 4.01. Protei n sequence comparisons were performed using 
the facilities of the BL AST server (Altschul et al. , 1990) at NCBI (Natl. Library of Medicine, 
Washington, D.C.).  
PCR primers used to clone aroG  
Using alignments of plant-type (putative) DAHP-synthase proteins (Fig. 4), degenerate primers 
were designed on the basis of two conserved motifs. PLDS1: 5'-GG(G/C)(A/C)G(G/C)ATCGC 
(G/C)GG(G/C)CA(G/A)-3' and PLDS2: 5'-( G/C)GTGTT(G/C)CCGTGCAT(G/C)GG-3'. PCR 
experiments with these primers, using A. methanolica  DNA as template, yielded a single DNA-
fragment of approx. 730 bp with strong sequence similarity to plant type DAHP-synthase genes. 
Specific primers PLDS3 and PL DS4 were designed (Fig. 4) , and used to screen an 
A.methanolica  genomic library. 
 
Construction and PCR screening of genomic DNA library 
An A. methanolica  genomic DNA library was constructed using partially Sau3A digested 
chromosomal DNA, sized by sucrose gradient centrifugation. Fragments of 8-12 kb were cloned 
in the BamHI site of pZErO-2.0, allowing positive se lection of recombinants. Transformation of 
E. coli  DH5 α with ligation mixture generated a DNA library of ~5000 independent 
transformants (average insert size 7.8 kb; insert frequency 92%). 
Gene library screening for the aroG  gene was performed by PCR, using primers 
PLDS3 (5'-TCGCACTTCCTGTGGAT-3') and PLDS4 (5'-TGCCAGATGACCTTGTG-3'). 
Plates with ~100 gene library transformants were  replica plated. Subsequently, all cell material 
from the original plate was resuspended in  1 ml LB medium from which plasmid DNA was 
isolated and subjected to PCR analysis. Colonies originating from plates with a positive outcome were subjected to individual PCR analysis. This resulted in identification of a positive 
clone containing an insert of approx. 8 kb. 
 
Southern hybridization of aroF  
Digested chromosomal DNA from A. methanolica  was separated on a 0.8 % (w/v) agarose gel 
and blotted onto a high-bond nylon membrane supplied by Qiagen (Basel, Switzerland), via an alkaline transfer method (Sambrook et al. , 1989). Southern hybridization was performed at 
65
0C, using the entire aroF  gene (for DS2) of  A. methanolica  as a probe. Radioactive probe 
labeling was performed with the high prime DNA labeling kit from Boehringer Mannheim.  
Following hybridization the membrane was washed at 650C with 2xSSC (1xSSC is 0.15M NaCl 
and 0.015M sodium citrate) containing 0.5% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) for 10 min, 
twice with 1xSSC containing 0.5% (w/v) SDS at room temperature and three times with 
0.3xSSC containing 0.5% (w/v) SDS at room temperature.  Chapter 7 
 
  
104 Estimation of molecular we ight of native proteins 
The molecular weights of AroF and AroG were estimated by loading E. coli cell free extracts on 
a Superdex-200 column (XK 16/60) equilibrated with Tris HCl-buffer (pH 7.5). Bio-Rad gel 
filtration standard proteins (670, 158, 44 and 17 kDa proteins) (Bio-Rad, Richmond, Calif. 
USA) were used as standards.  
Analytical methods 
Protein concentrations were determined with the protein determination kit from Bio-Rad, using 
bovine serum albumin as standard (Richmond, CA, USA) (Bradford, 1976). 
 
Accession numbers  
The DAHP-synthase encoding nucleotide sequences of A. methanolica  presented in this paper 
were entered into Genbank u nder accession numbers AY382157 ( aroF ) and AY382158 ( aroG ). 
The accession number of the A. methanolica PDT amino acid sequence is Q44104. 
 
 
Results 
Isolation of A. methanolica  pFPhe resistant mutants 
The PDT and CM enzymes of A. methanolica  are sensitive to inhibition by (pF)Phe. Growth of 
A. methanolica  wild type on glucose mineral agar with pFPhe at 32.5 mM is completely 
inhibited. Previously we have shown that this is due to inhibition of Phe synthesis and can be 
overcome by adding Phe to the growth medium (De Boer L. et al. , 1990b). This allowed 
straightforward selection of A. methanolica  mutants with deregulated PDT/CM enzymes. 
Colonies of A. methanolica  started to appear after 4 days of incubation on glucose mineral 
medium agar plates with pFPh e. The maximum number of pFPhe resistant mutants was reached 
after seven days (mutant frequency ~10
-5). Transfer to fresh agar plates with the same pFPhe-
containing medium, resulted in growth of almost 80% of the pFPhe resistant colonies. Cell 
extracts of mutant strains harvested from gluc ose mineral medium cultures were assayed for 
PDT and CM activities and analyzed for Phe and Tyr feedback inhibition. 
A. methanolica  wild type PDT activity is inhibited up to 70% by 1 mM Phe, and 
stimulated by a factor two by a similar amount of Tyr (Table 2) (Euverink et al. , 1995b). Of 76 
colonies tested, 7 had (completely) lost Phe f eedback inhibition sensitivity, while 5 of those 7 
mutants also had completely lost the stimulatory effect of Tyr. Similar results were obtained for PDT enzymes in 2 previously (Euverink et al. , 1995b) isolated FPhe resistant A. methanolica  
mutants, strains pFPhe32 and oFPhe84. None of these 9 strains carrying PDT mutants were 
affected in CM sensitivity to Phe inhibition. No PDT mutants were detected that had lost the stimulatory effect  of Tyr only. 
 A further two of the 76 mutants tested were affected in CM feedback inhibition 
activity. Both mutants (strains pFPhe4 and pF Phe25) were completely insensitive to the 
inhibitory effect of Phe (50% in wild type s ituation), while Tyr (1 mM) inhibition was reduced 
to 25 % (50 % in wild type situation). The presence of both Phe and Tyr (1 mM each) in the 
reaction mix yielded 35 % relative inhibition (85 % in wild type situation).  
CM only displays its feedback inhibition sensitivity when bound within the CM-
DAHP-synthase enzyme complex (w ith DS1; see below) (Euverink et al. , 1995a). The inhibitor 
binding domain involved in this phenomenon thus may be located on the DAHP-synthase moiety. In this situation, two types of CM and DAHP-synthase feedback inhibition resistant 
mutants may occur: (I) a DS1 mutation resulting in loss of feedback inhibition sensitivity of 
both CM activity and DS1 activity, and (II) a regulatory mutation leading to de-repression of (Phe feedback inhibition insensitive) DS2 and CM synthesis, similar to mutant oFPhe83 Regulation of the Phenyl alanine specific pathway 
 
 
105(Euverink et al. , 1995a). The two isolated mutant st rains with deregulated CM enzymes 
therefore were tested for th eir DAHP-synthase activities and feedback inhibition patterns. 
Mutants pFPhe4 and pFPhe25 both possessed 9-10 fold higher DAHP-synthase activity levels. 
Similar to mutant oFPhe83, this DAHP-synthase activity was most strongly feedback inhibited 
by Tyr, indicating the presence of (de-represse d) DS2 activity (Table 3). Screening of the 
remaining 74 pFPhe resistant mutant strains did not yield a single mutant with deregulated DS1 
activity.

Sequence analysis and heterologous ex pression of deregulated PDT mutants 
Cloning and nucleotide sequencing of the 9 mutant pdt genes revealed point mutations in 6 
different nucleotides (mutants A125G, A198P, A198V, N200K, L209F and H227R (Table 2). 
Mutants N200K and L209F were still activated by Tyr (Table 2). The A. methanolica  wild type 
and mutant pdt genes were cloned into pET3b, resulting in plasmids pHK255(1-10). PDT 
activity in E. coli  strain BL21(DE3)-pHK255 expressing the A. methanolica  wild type pdt gene 
reached levels of 19 U.mg-1, while PDT activity in the E. coli  BL21(DE3)-pET3b control strain 
was 0.009 U.mg-1. Effects of Phe and Tyr on mutant PDT proteins were similar in E. coli  
BL21(DE3)-pHK255(1-10) extracts and in A. methanolica  mutant strains.  
 
PDT sequence alignments  
Sequence alignments revealed that  A. methanolica  PDT shares considerab le similarity with 
other (monofunctional) actinomycete PDT sequences (Fig. 2). Also the PDT encoding domains 
of P-proteins aligned well with A. methanolica  PDT, albeit with lower relative sequence 
similarity.

108 Analysis, expression and characterization of A. methanolica  AroF  
Previously (Alves et al. , 1996), we reported the fortuitous cloning of an E. coli -type DAHP-
synthase gene from A. methanolica . Completion of the nucleotide sequence of this DAHP-
synthase gene revealed that it potentially encodes a protein with a subunit Mr of 37.8 kDa 
(Table 4). Alignments of this A. methanolica  DAHP-synthase with other E. coli  type DAHP-
synthase proteins revealed significant simila rities. However, some residues within the 
AIGARTTESQ-motif, highly conserved in E. coli  type proteins, are different in the A. 
methanolica  and A. mediterranei  DAHP-synthase proteins (Table 4; URL: 
http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam). 
Cloning of the A. methanolica  DAHP-synthase gene in the expression vector pET3b 
(pHK276) resulted in its successful expression in E. coli  strain BL21(DE3). The DAHP-
synthase activity expressed was strongly feedback inhibited by Tyr (similar to E. coli  AroF, 
(Shultz et al. , 1984)) and the protein was therefore referred to as AroF. It also displayed 
intermediate sensitivity toward Trp but was unaff ected by the addition of Phe (Table 3). These 
characteristics resemble the feedback inhibition pattern of A. methanolica  DS2 activity, as 
observed in mutant strain oFPhe 83  (Table 3). 
Expression  of aroF  was stimulated one order of magnitude when 0.5 M sorbitol was 
added to the LB growth medium as a compatible solute (Table 3). The amount of AroF present 
in extracts of cells grown on LB with 0.5 M sorbitol was estimated to be about 20% of total protein as observed on SDS-PAGE gels (data not shown).  
During PCR amplification of the aroF  gene, a PCR fragment was isolated with an opal 
stop codon mutation at nucleotide position 907 of the ORF. Expression of this mutated aroF  
(pHK276-0) encoding a protein with a subunit molecular mass of 31.5 kDa instead of 37.8 kDa, 
yielded a protein insensitive to feedback inhibition. Rather, Phe and Trp now had a stimulatory 
effect on the activity of the truncated protein (Table 3). 
 
Table 4 . Partial alignment of amino acid sequences of ( E. coli -type DAHP-synthase) AroF of A. methanolica , 
DAHP-synthase proteins closely related to AroF and the three E. coli  DAHP-synthase isozymes. The 
percentage identity and similarity between A. methanolica  AroF and each of the other DAHP-synthase 
proteins is shown. Aberrant residues with in the AIGARTTESQ-motif are shown in bold .

Cloning and characterization of a second DAHP-synthase gene  
Attempts to clone the DS1 gene from chromosomal DNA of A. methanolica  in Southern 
hybridization experiments using aroF  as a probe failed (data not shown). Using PCR screening, 
we therefore searched for a plan t type DAHP-synthase gene in A. methanolica.   
DNA sequence determination of 4.5 kb of th e insert of the positive clone selected (see 
Methods), revealed an ORF of 1391 bp potentially encoding a 50,687 kDa protein, showing a 
high degree of sequence similarity toward other plant type DAHP-synthase proteins (Fig. 3).  Regulation of the Phenyl alanine specific pathway

Figure 3 . Amino acid sequence alignment of plant-type DAHP-synthase proteins. For the meaning of 
alignment indicators, see legend Fi g. 2. The percentage similarity between AroG and each of the other 
DAHP-synthase proteins is shown underneath. Bold characters refer to  conserved motifs used to design 
PCR primers PLDS1 and PLDS2. The positions of pr imers PLDS3 and PLDS4 are indicated by arrows. 
 
 
Heterologous expression of this ORF, designated aroG , was achieved in E. coli  by cloning the 
gene into the expression vector pET3b (pHK287 ). DAHP-synthase activity in cell extracts of E. 
coli strain BL21(DE3)/pHK287 was very sensitive to Trp feedback inhibition, as observed for 
DS1 of A. methanolica  (Table 3, wild type situation). The amount of AroG present in extracts of 
cells of the heterologous host was estimated to be approx. 15 %, as observed on SDS-PAGE 
gels (data not shown).  
 
Gel filtration analysis of A. methanolica  AroF and AroG 
Extracts of mutant oFPhe83 expressed DS2 DA HP-synthase protein in a monomeric form 
(Euverink et al. , 1995a). The native molecular weights of both A. methanolica  DAHP-synthase 
proteins expressed in E. coli  were determined by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex-
200 column. Elution times of the AroF and AroG activity peaks corresponded to Mr’s of 160 
and 200 kDa, respectively (data not shown). In view of their subunit Mr (37.8 and 50.7 kDa, respectively), these results indicate that bot h proteins are expressed as tetramers in E. coli . No 
(significant) monomeric DAHP-synthase activity coul d be determined in either of the extracts, 
corresponding to the DS2 activity found earlier in A. methanolica  mutants GH141 and oFPhe83 
(Euverink et al. , 1995a). 
  
Effects of AroG on CM activity and feedback inhibition sensitivity  
Mutant strain GH141 displayed a strongly increased level of deregulated CM activity, not 
associated with a DAHP-synthase enzyme. The di meric CM activity of this mutant could be 
activated and its feedback control restored by addition of gel filtration fractions containing 
DAHP-synthase activity (Euverink et al. , 1995a).  
Titration of Superdex-200 ge l filtration fractions containi ng DS1 AroG (purity approx. 
60%) to cell extracts of mutant GH141 stimulated CM activity by a factor 5, also restoring its 
feedback inhibition sensitivity (Fig. 4). These eff ects were not observed in titration experiments 
with DS2 AroF to cell extracts of GH141.

AroF proteins to cell extracts (67 µg protein) of mutant GH141. CM activities were determined with AroG in 
the presence (open squares) or abs ence (open circles) of 1 mM Phe and Tyr, and with AroF in the presence 
(closed triangles) or absence (closed circles) of 1 mM Phe and Tyr. 
 
 
Discussion 
This study shows that the phenylalanine analogue  pFPhe can be used efficiently to screen for 
spontaneous A. methanolica  mutants carrying mutant forms of PDT that have retained full 
activity but are devoid of Phe feedback control. Similar approaches have been applied to create 
Amycolatopsis  strains overproducing primary and secondary metabolites originating from 
(precursors of) Phe (data not shown). Furthermore,  the data presented provides new information 
about amino acid residues directly or indirectly involved in Phe and Tyr binding by PDT. Four of the six mutations were found to affect both the stimulatory effects of Tyr and inhibitory 
effects of Phe, indicating that both effector mol ecules bind at the same effector binding site of 
PDT. In the E. coli P-protein Phe binding was shown to occur in the C-terminal domain (Zhang 
et al. , 1998) and, using isothermal titration calorimetry, interactions between Phe and a 12 kDa 
C-terminal P-protein fragment (residues 286 to 386) were established (Pohnert et al. , 1999). 
Alignments of A. methanolica  PDT and the E. coli  P-protein indicate that all PDT feedback 
inhibition resistant mutants, except for the o FPhe84 PDT mutation A125G, are located within 
this (regulatory) domain (Fig. 2). The overall primary structures of A. methanolica  PDT and the 
E. coli  P-protein are similar, which may suggest a similar 3D structure of both proteins. Effector 
binding sites may thus be well conserved. 
All other mutations found to affect A. methanolica  PDT feedback inhibition control are 
located in the vicinity -but not within- the highly conserved GALV and ESRP regions ( E. coli  
P-protein residues 309-312 and 329-332, respectively) (Fig. 2). Mutations in the hydrophobic 
GALV region, decreasing its hydrophobic nature or introducing large side chains, impaired Phe-Chapter 7 
 
  
112 binding in the E. coli  P-protein (Pohnert et al. , 1999). Conserved residues within the GALV and 
ESRP regions may also be important in Phe and Tyr binding in A. methanolica  PDT, but 
mutations in these residues may well be detrim ental for PDT activity due to incorrect protein 
folding. Obviously, such mutations will not be found, when screening for fully active, 
deregulated PDT mutants. 
The A. methanolica  PDT mutant H227R is located near the ESRP region, mutants 
A198P, A198V, N200K and L209F are all located near the GALV region. A198, which is not a 
conserved residue, may be part of the hydrophobic binding pocket and the introduction of the more bulky Pro and Val side chains may prevent Phe and Tyr binding. The Lactococcus lactis  
and Aquifex aeolicus  putative PDT proteins, however, do contain a Pro and a Val residue at their 
equivalent A198 positions, respectively. These proteins have not been characterized yet, 
however, and their sensitivity to feedback inhibiti on by Phe remains to be studied. It is unlikely 
that the charged N200, which is conserved in various PDT proteins, is (directly) involved in Phe (or Tyr) side chain binding. Also binding of the carboxyl group of the effector molecule is 
unlikely, since it is still activat ed by Tyr. The P-protein of E. coli  contains a Gln at this position, 
which was shown to be essential for feedback regulation (Nelms et al. , 1992). The well-
conserved L209 may be part of  a hydrophobic pocket, involved in binding of the Phe (and Tyr) 
side chain. Why Phe feedback inhibition resistant mutant L209F is still capable of Tyr binding, 
remains unclear.  
 Only two CM and DAHP-synthase mutants were identified among the pFPhe resistant 
strains, both with de-repressed CM and DS 2 activity levels. We failed to clone the A. 
methanolica  gene encoding CM. Sequence analys is of the surrounding regions of the aroF  and 
aroG  genes revealed that the CM gene is not organized in an operon with one of these DAHP-
synthase genes. The de-repression of both ac tivities suggests that a common (unidentified) 
transcriptional regulator of both genes has been mutated. No AroG feedback inhibition resistant 
mutants were isolated, which also would have resulted in a deregulated CM activity. Mutant 
selection was directed toward active proteins, and deregulated AroG mutants may possess no or 
only low activities. Such mutants therefore may have escaped detection in the selection procedure used. 
 Several plant type DAHP-synthases have been identified in actinomycetes, e.g. in 
Streptomyces  species (Walker et al. , 1996). This type of DAHP-synthase is often involved in the 
biosynthesis of secondary me tabolites, such as the ansamycin antibiotic rifamycin in A. 
mediterranei  (Yu et al. , 2001), phenazine in Ps. aureofaciens  (Pierson et al. , 1995), aurachin in 
S. aurantiaca  (Silakowski et al. , 2000), chloramphenicol in Streptomyces venezuelae  (He et al. , 
2001) and ansatrienin and naphthomycin in Streptomyces collinus  (Chen et al. , 1999). In 
contrast, in Xanthomonas campestris  a plant type enzyme functions  as the sole DAHP-synthase 
supporting aromatic amino acid biosynthesis (Gosset et al. , 2001).  
Expression of both A. methanolica  DAHP-synthase proteins in E. coli was successful. 
Addition of 0.5 M sorbitol even further increased DAHP-synthase activity by a factor of 8. The 
inhibition pattern of AroG was similar to that of  DS1 activity, with Trp as its main effector, and 
that of AroF was similar to DS2 activity, with Tyr showing the strongest inhibition.  
Gel filtration experiments show that AroF is expressed in E. coli  as a tetramer. The 
protein responsible for DS2 activity found in mutant A. methanolica  strain oFPhe83, however, 
was monomeric with a Mr of approx. 42 kDa. Possibly, AroF expressed in E. coli  is assembled 
as a tetramer, while it remains a monomer in its original host. PCR fragment analysis did not indicate the presence of a seco nd plant type DAHP-synthase gene, since several cloned PCR 
fragments were identical in DNA sequence. Fu rthermore, feedback inhibition patterns of 
DAHP-synthase activities in wild type and E. coli /pHK276 were similar (Table 3). Regulation of the Phenyl alanine specific pathway 
 
 
113From the CM-DAHP-synthase titration experiments we conclude that AroG is 
associated with CM to form a hetero hexameri c enzyme complex. AroG  clearly activates CM 
activity up to a factor 5 and restores its feedback  sensitivity to Phe and Tyr, as observed in the 
A. methanolica  wild type strain. The close associatio n of the AroG and CM proteins, and the 
feedback inhibition pattern of AroG, show that  AroG activity supports aromatic amino acid 
biosynthesis in A. methanolica . Also AroF activity, however, potentially makes an important 
contribution, becoming de-repressed under Phe limiting conditions (this study) (Euverink et al. , 
1995a).
