111 Abstract 
Water pollution control is presently one of the major areas of scientific activity. 
While coloured organic compounds generally impart only a minor fraction of the 
organic load to wastewater, their colour renders them aesthetically unacceptable. 
Effluent discharges from the textile industries to neighbouring water bodies and 
wastewater treatment systems have been given of much concern especially in recent 
years. Colour removal, in particular, has recently become of major scientific interest, 
as indicated by the large number of related research reports. 
The bacterium, Shewanella strain J 18 143, has been reported to be capable of directly 
inducing the reduction of azo bonds in reactive azo dyes and, indirectly being 
involved in the reduction of azo/ketohydrazone chromophores in pigment molecules. 
Two approaches have been used to extend the applications of Shewanella strain J 18 
143 in the treatment of textile wastewaters. The first approach concerned the use of 
this bacterium, in an immobilised form, in removing the colour from reactive azo dye 
solutions. The second approach was the use of this bacterium, in a free form, in 
reducing colour from selected metal-complex azo dye solutions. 
A grafted cellulose copolymer was chosen as the immobilisation substrate. The 
cotton fabric was firstly pre-treated and then underwent copolymerisation with the 
use of acrylic acid as the monomer and potassium persulphate as an initiator. Soxhlet 
extraction as used for after-treatment of the modified cellulose. The grafting yield of 
the graft copolymer was controlled at 5.5%. 
The bacterial cells were immobilised by three methods. The first method, 
"growing-in", was carried out by growing the bacterial starter culture with the 
presence of graft cellulosic copolymer. The cells were therefore bound to the 
substrate. The immobilisation method of adsorption was carried out by allowing the 
pre-grown, resting cells to physically adsorb onto the copolymeric substrate. The 
third method, chemical coupling, was carried out by coupling the bacterial cells onto 
IN, the substrate using a coupling agent, carbodi-imide (CMC). Protein assay of 
immobilised cells was studied. The method derived from the use of the BCA kit «was 
applied for a qualitative confidence of the presence of the immobilised cells. 
Decoloration of Remazol Black B solution was carried out using the immobilised 
cells. In all of the three methods the immobilised cells were able to decolorise the 
dye. The immobilisation methods of "growing-in" and chemical coupling were found 
more effective in decoloration. Complete decoloration of the dye solutions was 
observed. The potential use of the graft copolymer substrate was confirmed. 
Four Irgalan series metal-complex azo dyes, Irgalan Grey GLN, Irgalan Black RBLN, 
Irgalan Blue 3GL and Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWL, were decolorised using planktonic 
cells of Shewanella strain J 18 143. 
The bacterial cells completely decolorised the solution of Irgalan Grey GLN, apart 
from that some coloured by-products were observed in the system. Irgalan Grey 
GLN is a mixture of Irgalan Black RBLN and Irgalan Blue 3GL. Colour reductions 
of these two metal-complex azo dyes were achieved using planktonic bacterial cells. 
The results obtained were similar to that of the Irgalan Grey GLN. The colour of the 
solutions was reduced. Some coloured materials were produced at the bottom and at 
the top of the aqueous treating system. 
Colour reduction of Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWL was carried out using the planktonic 
biological cells Shewanella strain J18 143. Not too much colour reduction can be 
found from the visual results and from the UV-visible spectra. However, some 
changes were made by the biological cells. Some precipitation was observed at the 
bottom the evaluating system which contained Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWL and the 
cells. This observation was further proved by the particle sizing analysis. The particle 
cells analysis has shown the standard dye solution has 35% of particles with a size no 
more than 1.1 nm. The biological treated the aqueous system contained particles, up 
to 20%, with a size range of 500 nm to 7000nm. 
`I The effect of the dye concentration, the incubation temperature and the pH on the 
colour reduction of the selected metal-complex azo dyes was studied. The 
evaluations were carried out by evaluating the colour reduction rate against the 
varied factors. 
For the colour reduction of Irgalan Grey GLN. the colour reduction rate was 
increased as the dye concentration increased, the optimum temperature of for the 
colour reduction was around 50°C, and the reduction rate has shown to be higher at 
pH range 6 to 9. Same results have shown to the colour reduction of the Irgalan 
Black RBLN and Irgalan Blue 3GL, except that the optimum operating temperature 
for the Irgalan Blue 3GL was at 40°C. Although the colour reduction of the Irgalan 
Yellow 3RL KWL was not significant, the effects of these factors were investigated. 
The maximum colour reduction was achieved at a dye concentration of 0.11 g dm"3, 
at a temperature of 40°C and pH range from 6 to 8.

\\1v 1 Introduction 
In Section 1.1, the introductory material and literature reviews are focused on the 
occurrence and treatment of coloured textile wastewaters including the source of 
textile wastewaters, the environmental impact of textile wastewaters and the problem 
of colour in textile wastewaters. 
In Section 1.2, matters relating to the issues of reactive dye effluents are considered. 
This section begins with an introduction to basic aspects, including the development 
and the chemistry of reactive dyes. The problems that have been brought by the 
reactive dyes in textile wastewaters, especially those related to reactive azo dyes are 
addressed in this section. 
Matters relating to the use of metal-complex azo dyes in the textile wastewaters are 
included in Section 1.3. These include general information of the development of 
metal-complex dyes, aspects of the chemistry of metal-complex azo dyes and the 
environmental impact of metal-complex azo dyes in textile wastewaters. 
The colour removal techniques, in the treatment of textile wastewaters are introduced 
in Section 1.4. These techniques are considered in three categories, the physical 
methods, the chemical methods and the biological methods. These three categories 
are treated in two sub-sections in Section 1.4. These two sub-sections are 
physio-chemical methods and biological methods. The applications of Shewanella 
strains are introduced at the end of the section. 
Matters relating to the use of immobilised biological cells in colour removal are 
given in Section 1.5. The immobilisation methods and aspects of the immobilisation 
substrates are considered in this section. The use of cellulose and of modified 
celluloses as immobilisation substrates are introduced at the end of this section. 1.1 Textile coloured wastewater 
Textile industry is very energy-, water-, and chemical- use intensive. Worldwide, the 
industry is one of the major water consumers. In localised situations, textile 
coloration can be considered to be a major source of waterborne pollutions. 
1.1.1 Source of textile wastewater 
Within the textile industry, approximately 60 percent of the total energy that is 
consumed is within the wet-processing stages. In wet processing. almost all of the 
chemicals, dyes etc., are discharged into effluents. It is not surprising that wet 
processing operations in the textile industry are among the major causes for 
waterborne pollution (Mishra and Tripathy, 1993). The chemical treatments that are 
used during the wet processing of textiles include desizing, scouring, bleaching, 
dyeing, printing and finishing. Table 1.1.1 gives the various stages involved and also 
the inputs and outputs from these stages (Source: Integrated Pollution Prevention and 
Control, Sector guidance note 6.05). Water is mainly used as a solvent for the 
processing of chemicals and as a washing and rinsing medium. Most wet processing 
involves treatments with chemicals-containing baths, which often require washing, 
rinsing, and drying stages between key treatment steps. Consequently, large volumes 
of wastewater are generated, with a very diverse range of contaminants that must be 
treated prior to disposal. Much energy is consumed in heating and cooling 
chemical-treatment baths, to heat the wash waters and to dry the fabrics or yarns 
(Snowden-Swan, 1995). Wet processing is associated with dyeing and finishing that 
takes place in the dyehouse or finishing mill. Finishing is a final stage in the 
manufacture of a textile. The textile finishing industry has a high specific \\ ater 
demand that may be as much as 500 dm3 k`"' in a process as shown in Table 1.1. "1 
(Karcher et al., 2002: Menezes, 2003). It has been established that the UK textile 
dyeing and finishing industry uses over 60,000 million litres of water every year 
1) (Source: Environmental Agency, 2006). A large amount of wastewater is generated 
from the dyeing processes and subsequent rinsing steps. forming one of the larger 
contributions to wastewater generation in the textile industry. Some of the common 
pollutants that exist in textile finishing effluents are shown in Table 1.1.3 (Broadbent, 
2001). No doubt, the industry faces increasing pressure regarding environmental and 
waste-related concerns as a result of the quantity and toxicity of generated 
wastewaters.

1.1.2 Environmental concerns regarding textile wastewaters 
Textile wastewaters cause serious problems to the environment. Such problems are 
of both national and international concern. The effluent from textile processing is 
often either discharged into a municipal sewage treatment plant or directly into 
4 waterways. Textile wastewaters may include many types of dyes. detergents. 
insecticides, pesticides. greases and oils, sulphide compounds. solvents. heavy metal 
salts, inorganic salts and fibres (Sostar-Turk et al., 2005), as listed in Table 1.1.3. It 
is not surprising that the wastewater discharged from the textile industries is 
characterised by strong colour, a high organic load (COD/BOD, COD refers to the 
chemical oxygen demand and BOD is the biochemical oxygen demand). a large 
amount of suspended solids, a highly fluctuating pH, high temperatures and low 
biodegradability (Joo et al., 2007; Karim et al., 2006; $ayan, 2006). Table 1.1.4 
shows the effluent characteristics from different operations in textile processes.

1 The biological oxygen demand (BOD) is an important measure of the impact of 
industrial wastewaters on the environment. It is the amount of oxygen consumed in 
the biological processes that break down organic matter in water, often during a 
five-day test. It is expressed in milligrams of oxygen per litre of wastewater. 
Although the BOD is not a specific parameter, it is used as an indirect measure of the 
concentration of biologically degradable materials that are present in the wastes. 
BOD can be used as an indicator of pollutant level where the greater the BOD, the 
more pronounced is the degree of pollution (Willmott, 1997). 
Table 1.1.5 summarises the expected or most probable pollution loads of BOD, along 
with pH, total solids (TS) and water consumption, resulting from each processing 
operation of the various raw materials. 
The chemical oxygen demand (COD) is also a very important factor concerning the 
impact of industrial wastewaters on the environment. It is amount of the oxygen 
consumed in the complete chemical oxidation of soluble organic compounds to 
produce CO2 and H2O. It is also expressed in mg dm"3, indicating the mass of oxygen 
that is consumed per litre of wastewater. The COD is commonly monitored by 
quantifying the amount of the oxygen that is used when the contaminants are 
oxidised in a boiling aqueous acidic dichromate ion solution (Willmott, 1997). 
The COD level can be determined more readily than the BOD. However, this 
measurement does not indicate how much of the waste can be decomposed by 
biological oxidation. The COD is often used as a measure of the organic matter that 
is in industrial and municipal wastes that contain compounds that are toxic to 
bacteria. The COD represents the level of pollution of water caused by the 
compounds. Organic matter is the most common source of reducible compounds that 
are found in the water. Therefore. the COD can be used to indicate the level of the 
organic pollution in the wastewater; the greater the COD, the greater the degree and 
impact of the pollution.

As mentioned above, a larger value of COD indicates that the content of the 
reducible compounds (organic matter) is greater. The reducible compounds can 
lower the amount of dissolved oxygen in water. As a result, the position of fish and 
7 aquatic life can become untenable. In addition, theses species can become sensitised 
to other toxic chemicals, noxious odours and toxic organics that may be produced 
subsequently. 
Dyeing auxiliaries or organic substances that are non-recyclable are more likely to be 
responsible for the high COD/BOD of the effluents (Allegre et al.. 2006). The 
maximum acceptable concentrations for effluent discharge into the public sewer are 
1200-2500 mg of COD dm-3 of wastewater and 600 mg of BOD dm-3 of wastewater 
(Skelly, 2003). The discharges to surface water in the UK are limited to 50 mg of 
COD dm-3 of wastewater and 30 mg of BOD dm-3 of wastewater, as listed in Table 
1.1.6 (Kamilaki, 2000).

1 he pH of textile wastewater may vary. This is because acids and alkalis are used in 
the dyeing process, depending on the type of the dye involved. Also, large quantities 
of alkali are used in bleaching, desizing, scouring and mercerising (Delee et al.. 
1998). According to Fox and Pickle (1996). the pH of textile effluents ranges from I 
8 to 13 in standard pH units, as shown in Table 1.1.5. The temperature of the textile 
effluent also varies, depending on the type of the dye and on the dyeing process. In 
the UK, the pH of the discharged wastewater is limited between 6 and 9. The 
temperature is limited to below 42°C at the point of discharge, as shown in Table 
1.1.6. 
The Total Suspended Solids, generally referred to as TSS, is a measure of the 
settleable solids and the non-settleable solids in the wastewater. Suspended solids in 
water reduce light penetration in the water and are often associated with toxic 
contaminants because organics and metal ions tend to bind to particles. TSS, like 
BOD, is an indicator of the relative strength of the liquid. Accordingly, the higher the 
TSS concentration, the greater is the pollution caused by the wastewater. The 
maximum acceptable concentrations of TSS and settleable SS (Suspended Solids) for 
effluent discharge into the public sewer are respectively 650-1200 mg dm-3 and 
15-40 mg dm-3 (Skelly, 2003). The amount of all of the solids in the water, including 
dissolved, suspended, and settleable components is defined as Total Solids (TS). 
Details of the TS in each textile wet operation are listed in Table 1.1.5. 
Textile industries generate large volumes of wastewaters that are polluted with dyes. 
Due to their high molecular weights, their complex structures and especially their 
high solubilities in water, they persist once discharged into a natural environment 
(Canizares et al., 2006). The dyes are difficult to biodegrade and some, particularly 
hydrolysed reactive dyes and certain acid dyes, are not readily absorbed by active 
sludge and, therefore pass through the treatment works into rivers and streams. Some 
dyes and auxiliaries contain heavy metal ions such as copper ions, zinc ions, and 
chromium ions that are not totally exhausted onto the fibre. These can be discharged 
and, clearly, have an environmental impact (Cooper, 1989). More information 
regarding the impact of coloured wastewater is given in Section 1.1.3. 
The consents and standards of the wastewater discharging limits vary across the 
different countries or the different regions. He«son (1999) presents numerical 
9 consents and standards of the major parameters for the discharge of aqueous 
discharges in the UK (Kamilaki, 2000). These are listed in Table 1.1.6. 
Concentrations of dye as low as 1 mg dm-3 can give rise to public complaint (Easton, 
1995). Textile processing wastewaters, typically with a dye content in the range 
10-200 mg dm-3, are therefore highly coloured and not acceptable (van der Zee. 
2002). There is increasing public pressure for improvements in river water quality 
and regulations governing contaminant release in water streams from industry are 
becoming increasingly stringent. ETAD (Ecological and Toxicological Association 
of Dyes and Organic Pigments Manufacturers) was set up in 1974, as an international 
association, to minimise any possible negative impacts of colorants on human health 
and on the environment. ETAD involves currently 41 member companies, based in 
15 countries worldwide, including China, Japan and some European countries. 
A UK government agency was launched in 1989 as the National Rivers Authority 
(NRA). It had responsibility for managing water resources, investigating and 
regulating pollution and taking over flood controls and land drainage from the former 
ten regional water authorities of England and Wales. In 1990, the National Rivers 
Authority (now the Environment Agency) set colour standards for discharges from 
sewage treatment works. These are covered under the Water Resources Act of 1991, 
as amended by the Environment Act 1995, Protection of water environment. In April 
1996, the NRA was replaced by the Environment Agency, having begun to establish 
a reputation for being supportive to wildlife projects and being tough on polluters. 
Following a judicial review of the authority in 1991, for allegedly failing to carry out 
its statutory duty to protect rivers and seas from pollution, river quality improved by 
26% in the period 1993-1996 (www. environmentagency. com). 
In 1999, legislation was introduced in the form of an Integrated Pollution Prevention 
and Control (IPPC) order for the UK and Europe. IPPC is a regulatory system that 
employs an integrated approach to control the environmental impact of certain 
industrial activities under the Pollution Prevention and Control (PPC) Act of 1999. 
Textile sector guidance. IPPC S6.0-5, has been produced by the Environment Agency 
10 for England and Wales in collaboration with the Scottish Environment Protection 
Agency (SEPA) and the Northern Ireland Environment and Heritage Service (EHS). 
It covers the textile treatment processes based on the IPPC Reference Document on 
Best Available Techniques in the European textile commission. 
1.1.3 Colour in textile effluent 
Colour is the most problematic feature of the textile wastewaters. Colour has to be 
removed from the waterborne effluent before such water can be discharged into 
water bodies or on land. The primary concern of effluent, colour is not only 
important because of the toxicity aspects but also because of the undesirable 
aesthetic impact it has on receiving waters. Historically, the discharge of coloured 
waste waters from textile dyehouses has prompted more complaints to the water 
companies than any other form of pollution (Willmott et al., 1998). Coloured 
wastewater is highly visible in very small concentrations, Pierce (1994) has pointed 
out that the human eye can detect concentrations of 0.005 mg dm-3 of reactive dye in 
water. Therefore, the presence of dye exceeding this limit would not be permitted on 
aesthetic grounds. The coloured compounds are not only aesthetically displeasing, 
also inhibit sunlight from penetrating into the stream and reduce photosynthetic 
reactions, representing serious problems to the environment. In some cases, dyes in 
low concentration are harmful to aquatic life (Eren and Acar, 2006; Karim et al., 
2006; Kwok et al., 2003). The absorbance values of an average textile discharging 
effluent and river quality objectives (RQO) colour consent limits have been 
summarised, according to different wavelengths, as shown in Table 1.1.7. 
The problem of coloured wastewaters comes from the release of the dyes to the 
environment. Dyes are discharged into environment via wastewaters from batch 
processes in both the dye-manufacturing and the dye-consuming industries. It has 
been stated that, from over 700.000 tons of dye produced annually worldwide, about 
10 ý were discharged in aqueous effluents from manufacturing operations and 9% from the coloration sector (Al-Ghouti et al.. 2003; Easton. 1995- Khehra et al.. 2006; 
Robinson et al., 2001). That is, about 10-15% of the used dyes are discharged as 
wastewater (Tsui et al., 2003). The U. S. Department of Commerce predicted a 3.5 
fold increase in textile manufacturing between 1975 and 2020 (Wallace. 2001). This 
implies that the consumption of the dyes and the development of the ne« dyes would 
increase correspondingly.

The vast variety of dyes brings up complicated problems that have their origin in the 
coloured wastewaters. The Society of Dyers and Colourists and the American 
Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists published the Colour Index, 3 `d 
Edition, in 1971 and the Colour Index International (Electronic resource), 4th Edition, 
in 2002. The Colour Index lists about 28,000 commercial dye names, representing 
-10,500 different dyes (van der Zee, 2002). Based on the application characteristics. 
the dyes used in the textile industries has been assigned as acid dyes, basic dves. 
direct dyes. disperse dyes. mordant dyes and reactive dyes. The degree of the dye 
fixation on the substrate is one of the major factors in determining the discharge of a 
dye to the receiving waters. Although the dye manufacturers have made considerable 
1? attempts at improving the levels of fixation, significant amounts of dyes are being 
released in the effluent, as shown in Table 1.1.8. It can be seen from Table 1.1.8. that 
up to 50% of reactive dye applied may be lost to the wastewaters. 
Table 1.1.8 Estimated Degree of Fixation for Different Dye/Fibre Combinations (Source: Easton, 
1995)

The problems brought about by the degradation of the dyes in solution are significant. 
Dyes are very difficult to treat due to their synthetic origin and their complex 
aromatic molecular structures. The structures are often constructed to resist fading on 
exposure to sweat, soap, water, light or oxidizing agents. These render the dyes 
towards being more resistant to the colour removal treatments (Banat et al., 1996). 
Brightly coloured, water-soluble reactive dyes and acid dyes are particularly 
problematic, passing unaffected through conventional treatment systems at the 
sewage works and entering watercourses (Willmott et al., 1998). 
1.2 Reactive dye effluents 
According to Colour Terms and Definitions (1988), a reactive dye is "a d, e that, 
under suitable conditions, is capable of reacting chemically with a substrate to form a 
13 covalent dye-substrate linkage". This unique characteristic of this dye class causes 
reactive dyes to have good properties in their wide range of brilliant shades. There is 
great versatility in the methods of their application and in their high wet fastness. 
There is also the increasing problem of "colour" in the textile discharging 
wastewaters. 
1.2.1 The development and use of reactive dyes 
It seems that all reviews on dyes begin with mention of mauveine, the first synthetic 
dye that was discovered in 1856 by William Henry Perkin (Venkataraman, 1952). 
This discovery stimulated chemists towards much more interest in synthetic dyes. 
Since then, over 100,000 synthetic dyes have been developed (Meyer, 1981; 
Willmott, 1997). The first reactive dyes for cellulosic fibres appeared on the market 
in 1956, introduced by ICI under the trade name Procion (Siegel, 1972), although 
many attempts had been made previously. Cross and Bevan (in 1895) recognised the 
fixation of a dye to a textile substrate via a covalent bond (Rys and Zollinger, 1989). 
In 1929, German workers introduced chloroacylamino groups into wool dyes. This 
work was developed by ICI. This led to the production of the first commercially 
available reactive dye, Supramine Orange R, brought out by I. G. Farben in the 
1930s for the dyeing of wool (Bahrini, 1996; Shore, 2002). In 1953, Stephen and 
Rattee worked on sulphonated monoazo compounds containing dichlorotriazinyl- 
amino groups, for wool dyeing, leading to the possibility of applying these dyes to 
cellulosic fibres, in the presence of alkali. This led to the marketing of Procion 
reactive dyestuffs in 1956 (Bahrini, 1996; Holme, 2006). In 1957, the Cibacron 
monochlorotriazinyl (Ciba) and Remazol vinyl sulphonyl (Hoechst) ranges were 
introduced. Since that time, many important reactive-dye ranges have been 
developed for cellulosic fibres (Holme, 2006). Nowadays, reactive dyes form the 
second largest dye class in the Colour Index with respect to the amount of active 
14 entries. About 600 of the -1050 different reactive dyes listed are in current 
production (van der Zee, 2002). 
Reactive dyes have a big market share and their use is still expanding due to their 
many advantages, such as availability in bright colours covering the complete colour 
gamut, good fastness properties, especially washfastness - due to the ease of 
covalent bonding, there being a reasonably wide range of application methods and 
the ease of dyeing by selection of suitable ranges (Tapley, 2002). It has been 
established that 33% of the worldwide production of colorants for cellulosic fibres by 
weight are reactive dyes. This figure rises to 43% if the reactive dyes are considered 
in terms of the cost of consumption (Yang and Yang, 2001). Reactive dyes have 
some disadvantages. These include incomplete fixation, the need for salt during 
application to promote dye uptake and extended washing-off times at the end of dye 
application to remove unfixed dye from the fabric. There is also a need to ensure that 
high wash fastness properties are actually achieved and that colour pollution in the 
discharging water is as low as possible. 
1.2.2 The structure and chemistry of reactive dyes 
Reactive dyes are a unique class of dyes in that they covalently react with the 
substrate. Other dyes are retained through physical forces of attraction or 
containment. Dye molecules often contain specific functional groups that can 
undergo addition or substitution reactions with the -OH, -SH and -NH2 groups that 
are present in textile fibres. 
The characteristic structure of a reactive dye generally consists of water solubilising 
group(s), the actual chromogen, the bridging linker, electrophilic reactive group(s) 
and a nucleofugic leaving group (Zollinger, 2003). 
The solubilising groups within reactive dyes are usually sulphonic acid groups, 
ranging in number between one and four. Generally, the substantivity of the dye 
decreases as a result of the increasing number of solubilising groups (Clark, 2002). 
Iý The chromogen in reactive dyes contributes to the colour and to much of the 
substantivity for the fibre. The major chromogens are azo. anthraquinone, 
phthalocyanine, formazan, oxazine, xanthene. and aminoketone (Shore, 2002: Colour 
Index, 3rd Ed. ). About 81% of reactive dyes are azo chromogens, which include 15% 
of the metallised azo species (Shore, 2002). Generally, reactive yellows, reactive 
oranges and reactive reds are unmetallised azo dyes. Anthraquinones and 
phthalocyanines and their derivatives are particularly important for the greens and 
blues. Most of violet, dark blue, brown and greyish black shades are metal-complex 
monoazo dyes. Reactive dyes with a chromogen of formazan are mainly blue and 
green metal complexes (Wang, 1987). Reactive dyes can be classified according to 
the chromophore or to the reactive system. Table 1.2.1 lists the chromogens of 
reactive dyes, the percentage of reactive dyes in each chemical class and the 
chemical structure of each chromogen.

The chromogen and reactive systems of the reactive dye are joined together through 
a bridging group, which is usually an amide (-NH-) group, although -NHCO- and 
-NH-SO2- groups are also used (Willmott, 1997). Bridging groups can influence the 
reactivity of the reactive system, the consistency of the reactive dyeing process and 
the degree of fixation of the dye (Bahrini, 1996, Res and Zollinger, 1989). 
17 The reactive system contains a reactive group and a leaving group, which enables the 
dye to form a covalent bond with the fibre and often also contributes some 
substantivity. There are several reactive groups in commercial reactive dyes: 
di chlorotriazinyl, monochlorotriazinyl, monofluorotriazinyl, trichloropyrimidvl. 
di fluorochloropyrimidyl, dichloroquinoxalinyl, nicotinyltriaziny1. and vinyl- 
sulphonyl, as shown in Table 1.2.2 (Broadbent, 2001). According to the reaction 
mechanisms, the reactive groups can be classified as halogenoheterocyclic reactive 
dyes (nucleophilic substitution), vinyl sulphone reactive dyes (nucleophilic addition) 
and other types of reactive dyes, depending on the type of reaction undergone, such 
as multiple addition/elimination reactions and single addition/elimination processes 
(Wang, 1987; Zollinger, 2003). Vinylsulphonyl dyes offer intermediate reactivity, 
lower substantivity but higher stability under acidic conditions than are possessed by 
other reactive dyes (Karnilaki, 2000).

Many of the early reactive dyes had only one reactive group in the dyestuff molecule. 
To enhance the possibilities of reaction between the dyes and the fibres, many of the 
newer reactive dyes are bifunctional, containing two or more identical 
(homobifunctional) or different (heterobifunctional) reactive groups. Those two 
reactive groups can be linked to a same chromogen or to different chromogens. The 
first bifunctional reactive dye, Remazol Black B (C. I. Reactive Black 5), was 
commercially produced by Hoechst in 1957 (Kamilaki, 2000). This dye contains two 
sulphatoethylsulphone groups and is almost symmetrical in structure. A detailed list 
of reactive groups in reactive dyes of the major dye manufacturers was presented by 
Rvs and Zollinger in The Theory of Coloration of Textiles" in 1989. Aspects of 
19 reactive groups of reactive dyes have been well featured in several revieý, wws 
(Venkataraman, 1972; Wang, 1987: Rys and Zollinger. 1989: Aspland, 1997: Shore. 
2002; Hunger, 2003 and Zollinger. 2003). 
1.2.3 Reactive dyes in textile effluents 
Reactive dyes have been and are considered to be the most environmental 
problematic compounds in textile dye effluents (Garcia-Montano et al., 2006). 
Reactive dyes are relatively poorly substantive to fibres. Thus, a substantial amount 
of electrolytes such as NaCl, Na2SO4 and NaOH must be added in the dyeing process. 
These electrolytes are additionally polluting to the wastewater. The dyeing of cotton 
fibres with reactive vinylsulphone dyes is carried out using NaCl, NaOH and urea, 
added to the dye-bath (Kurbus et al., 2003). Therefore, reactive dyes in dyeing 
wastewater have been identified as recalcitrant compounds since they provide high 
alkalinity in their use, contain a high concentration of organic materials and give 
strong colours in comparison with other dyes (Joo et al., 2007). 
In the dyeing of cellulosic fibres with reactive dyes, the addition of alkali to the 
dyebath not only promotes the formation of a covalent bond between the dye and the 
cellulosic substitute, it also causes the hydrolysis of the reactive groups in the dye. 
The reaction of the electrophilic group of the reactive dye with water (hydrolysis) 
competes with the fixation reaction (formation of a covalent bond between the dye 
and textile substrate). A large fraction, typically around 30%, of the applied reactive 
dye is wasted because of dye hydrolysis in the alkaline dyebath (Papis et al., 2004). 
In the case of cellulose-based substrates, both bond formation reactions 
(heteroaroniatic nucleophilic substitution and addition to an active alkene function) 
rely largely on the ionisation of the substrate with aqueous alkaline solution that, in 
turn, leads to competitive hydroxyl group attack and the destruction of the reactive 
moiety (Rentrew and Taylor. 1989). This process can be summarised as: 
?0 Dye +Cellulose +Water alkali Fixed Dye on Cellulose + 
Hydrolysed Dye in Solution 
After the reactive dyeing process is complete, 5 to 1500 mg of hydrolysed dye dm-' 
effluent remains in the bath (Gottlieb et al.. 2003. Santhy and Selvapathy. 2006). 
Hydrolysed reactive dyes do not react with the substrate, though they may be 
temporarily adsorbed, only to be washed off in later stages. This residual amount is 
responsible for the coloration of the effluents and cannot be recycled. Dyeing 
auxiliaries or organic substances are non-recyclable and are also partly responsible 
for the high BOD/COD of the effluents, as discussed in Section 1.1.2. In the textile 
industry, in order to accelerate or to increase the fixation of reactive dyes onto the 
fibres, it is necessary to use high electrolyte concentrations in the dyebath to decrease 
the negatively charged barrier between the substrate and anionic dyes (Carneiro et al., 
2004). About 60 to 100 g of electrolytes, especially sodium chloride and sodium 
carbonate, per litre of effluent, are responsible for the very high saline content of the 
wastewater (Allegre et al., 2006). All of the above factors are the basis of the 
fundamental problems that are associated with reactive dye effluents. 
Conventional processes such as coagulation, flocculation and biological methods that 
have been adopted for decolorising effluents that contain dissolved reactive dyes are 
no longer able to achieve adequate colour removal. The mechanism for the removal 
of soluble dyes by an aerobic biological treatment may be straightforward 
biodegradation, but it operates mainly by adsorption of the dye on to the biomass and 
destruction of the dye in subsequent sludge processing. Most classes of water-soluble 
dyes are removed from effluent streams by bioelimination (Easton, 1995). Reactive 
dyes form a notable exception. Unlike other water soluble dyestuff classes, reactive 
dves, in both their ordinary forms and in their hydrolysed forms are not easily 
biodegradable, with a maximum of 30% of breakdown being achieved, and only 10% 
being achieved on average. As a result, -90% of the reactive dye that enters an 
21 activated sludge sewage treatment works (STWI') will pass through unchanged and be 
discharged to river (Pierce, 1994). 
1.2.4 Reactive azo dyes 
Azo dyes are characterised by the presence of one or more azo groups (-N=N-) 
having aromatic rings that are mostly substituted by sulphonate groups. These dyes 
form the largest chemical class of dyes that are used regularly for textile dyeing and 
for paper printing (Chen, 2002). As previously mentioned, there about 65% of 
reactive dyes are unmetallised azo dyes and 15% are metallised azo dyes. 
Approaches that involve physical and/or chemical processes to remove the azo dyes. 
and therefore the colour, from the aqueous wastewater are often costly (Pearce et al., 
2006). However, the anaerobic reduction of azo dyes using microbial sludges can be 
an effective and economic treatment process for removing colour from reactive dye 
wastewaters (Wallace, 2001; Pearce et al., 2003). Most azo dyes are non-toxic. 
I lowever, the anaerobic degradation of reactive azo dyes involves not only a 
reduction of the azo bond but also the production of aromatic amines. The resultant 
aromatic amines resist further degradation and can be even more toxic than the dyes 
themselves (Brown and DeVito, 1993; Frijters et al., 2006). Because of the toxic 
potential of the aromatic amines, further degradation of the dye compound is 
necessary if toxicity is to be eliminated or reduced (Gottlieb et al., 2003). A high 
percentage of the intermediates of the azo dyes have been identified as carcinogens 
(Brown and DeVito, 1993). A proportion of these aromatic amines can be aerobically 
degraded (Razo-Flores et al., 1997). The remaining proportion of the aromatic 
amines will autoxidise to products that are expected to be easily removed. e. g. by 
attachment to flocculants that can then be easily separated (Frijters et al., 2006). A 
two stage mechanism for azo-reduction has been proposed, as shown below (Sponza 
and Iýik, 2002): 
27 2e- +2H' +(R-N=N-R')--*(R-AVH-. VH-R') (1) 
2e - +2H+ +(R-NH-NH-R')-->(R-NH, )+(R'-, V'H, ) (2) 
Here, it is speculated that the intermediate product of reaction (1) is an unstable 
colourless compound and the azo bond can become reformed upon oxidation, 
regaining some of the colour. 
1.3 Metal-complex azo dye effluents 
Two practical methods are used for the classification of the dyes on an international 
basis. One is based on the application characteristics. Dyes can be assigned as vat 
dyes, sulphur dyes, reactive dyes, direct dyes, disperse dyes, basic dyes, acid dyes 
and mordant dyes in the application ranges of textile colorants. Another classification 
route is according to the chemical structure of the dyes. The dyes then can be 
classified as azo dyes, anthraquinone dyes, phthalocyanine dyes, etc. Reactive dyes, 
as one of the textile application ranges were discussed in Section 1.2, with respect to 
their impact on textile wastewaters. A literature research of metal-complex azo dyes 
and their presence in textile effluents was undertaken with respect to their chemical 
classification as textile dyes. 
1.3.1 General information concerning metal-complex azo dyes 
Metal complexes have figured prominently in dyestuff chemistry developments. 
Metal-complex dyes are coordination compounds in which a metal ion is linked with 
one or more electron-donating (ion or molecule) ligands. Hunger (2003) has 
summarised some important events in the development of metal-complex dyes, as 
shown in Table 1.3.1. 
23 Table 1.3.1 Summary of Major Events in the Development of Metal-complex Dý es (Source: 
Hunger, 2003)

(G. Schetty, Geigy) 
1962 Unsymmetrical 2: 1 complex dyes containing only one sulpho group 
1970 2: 1 chromium complexes with two sulpho groups 
The preparation of water-soluble, 1: 1 chromium complexes of sulphonated 
dihyroxyanthraquinone dyes was achieved by Bohn in 1912. Similar complexes of 
azo mordant dyes in the same year, led to the introduction of the Palatin Fast (BASF) 
and Neolan (Geigy) ranges of 1: 1 premetallised dyes for wool (Burkinshaw, 1990). 
In 1949, Geigy introduced the first example of a 2: 1 chromium complex dyestuff 
having enhanced solubility, derived from a non-ionic solubilising group. This was 
the first member of their Irgalan range of dyestuffs. These are chromium complex 
14 and cobalt complex dyestuffs containing methy lsulphonyl groups. recommended for 
the fast dyeing of wool from neutral baths or from weakly acidic baths (Price, 1970). 
Metal complexes comprise an important class of chromophores. Metal-complex azo 
dyes are covered in applications of acid dyes, solvent dyes, reactive dyes and direct 
dyes. Table 1.3.2 summarises the distribution percentage of metal-complex azo dyes 
in each application range, the percentage of metal-complex azo dyes in each 
application and the distribution in the hue sector of metal-complex azo dyes, in each 
application (Shore, 2002; Colour Index, 3rd Ed. ).

1.3.2 Aspects of the chemistry of metal-complex azo dyes 
Metal-complex dyes are strong complexes of one metal atom (usually chromium, 
cobalt, copper or nickel) and one or two dye molecules, respectively 1: 1 and 1: 2 
metal complex dyes (van de Zee, 2002). Metal-complex-forming dyes need to have 
two or more electron-donating ligands, e. g., -OH, -COON. -NH,, or =N- (azo dyes). 
1ý The class may be divided conventionally into metal-complex azo dyes and 
metal-complex non-azo dyes, the former being the more important group (Price, 
1970). The metal-complex azo dyes contain azo group(s) to form a part of the 
metallisable system, which is most commonly derived from azo dyestuffs having 
metalllisable substituents in at least one ortho position relative to the azo group 
(Price, 1970). 
The most important metal-complex dyes are synthesised from 22-dihydroxy- (a), 
2-carboxy-2'-hydroxy- (b), 2-amino-2'-hydroxy-substituted azo dyes (c) and 
2,2'-dihydroxy- or 2-carboxy-2'-hydroxy- azomethine (d) dyes, (Zollinger, 2003), as 
shown in Figure 1.3.1. The aromatic nuclei are, in most cases, benzyl, naphthyl, or 
pyrazolonyl derivatives, as well as open-chain keto/enol systems.

Coordination of these trifunctional ligands (Figure 1.3.1) with a metal ion, involves 
the loss of a proton from each of the two substituted hydroxyl, amino or carboxylic 
groups of the azo or azomethine dye. This results in a structure comprising one five 
and one six-membered ring in the derived dye structure. The fundamental structure 
-6 of 1: 2 metal-complex azo dyes are shown as (a) and (b) in Figure 1.3.2 (Burkinshawv. 
1992).

Figure 1.3.2 Molecular Structure of the More Common 1: 2 Metal-Complex Azo Dyes 
The metal ion used is most commonly trivalent and hexa-coordinate. There are three 
metal ions that are of importance in metal-complex azo dyes, copper ions, chromium 
ions and cobalt ions (Price, 1970; Hunger, 2003). The copper ion, Cue+, has a 
coordination number of 4, and can form complexes with two bidentate ligands, or 
with one tri-or tetradentate ligand. Metal ions with a coordination number of 6 can 
form 1: 1 and 1: 2 complexes with tridentate ligands, such as Cr3+ and Co 3+ 
1.3.3 Metal-complex azo dyes in textile effluents 
The metal-complex azo dyes in textile effluents contribute to two problems. One 
concerns addition to the heavy metals that exist in the environment and one concerns 
the presence of the residual metal-complex dyes with a "visible" problem. Therefore, 
two tasks need to be met in the treatment of textile wastewaters, removing heavy 
metals ions and decoloration. 
2ý Heavy metal ions can affect the gromh, the extracellular enzyme production and the 
dye-decolorizing ability of the white rot fungi (Hatvani and Mecs. 2003). This is 
unfortunate, because metal-complex dyes are invaluable for their ability to produce 
photostable colours on polyamide and protein substrates (Edwards and Freeman, 
2005). The metal complex dyes are mostly based on chromium ions and cobalt ions. 
Even a small concentration of chromium ions in the water supply is not acceptable 
(Mishra and Tripathy, 1993). Chromium ions that are present in the dye effluents 
sometimes cause myelotoxicological, carcinogenic, mutagenic, teratological. and 
other severe effects on animals (Gupta, 1990). Much research has been carried out on 
reducing/removing the metal ions from polluted water and wastewaters (Hatvani and 
Mecs, 2003; Myers et al., 2000; Yu et al., 2003). However, only a few studies of the 
decoloration of metal-complex azo dyes have been established (Gupta et al., 1990; 
Van der Bruggen et al., 2001; Vijaykumar et al., 2006). 
1.4 Methods of colour removal from textile effluents 
The process of textile wastewater treatment is divided into a number of stages to deal 
with the waste effluents that contain a wide range of organic components and 
inorganic components that may or may not be soluble (Pearce, 2004). The unit 
processes in wastewater treatment plants are classified as preliminary treatment, 
primary treatment, secondary treatment, tertiary treatment and sludge treatment. The 
conventional operations involved in waste water treatment have been summarised by 
Willmott (1997), as shown in Table 1.4.1. 
The preliminary stage involves flow balancing and reduces any variation in 
temperature or concentration. thereby helping to enhance the performance of the 
downstream processes. This preliminary stage is followed by primary, secondary and 
tertiary treatments that combine physical, chemical and biological processes to 
remove suspended solids, metal ions. organics, colour and odour from the 
28 wastewater. The purpose of primary treatment is to remove settleable suspended 
solids.

29 The primary treatment removes finer solids by settling and/or by flotation and may 
also lower the oxygen availability requirements of subsequent treatments. This stage 
may also involve chemical neutralisation of the effluent stream or enhance the 
removal of small suspended solid particles through coagulation and flocculation 
(Willmott, 1997). 
The role of secondary treatment is to remove the colloidal material and the dissolved 
material remaining after the preliminary and primary treatment stages. Secondary 
treatment can include acid-cracking, chemical coagulation/flocculation - particularly 
using polyelectrolytes, biological degradation (aerobic and/or anaerobic), membrane 
separation (e. g. ultra-filtration), evaporation and/or incineration for wool scour 
effluents (HMIP, 1995). 
Tertiary treatment is a "polishing" step. The tertiary operations include the removal 
of phosphorus compounds, nitrogen compounds, dissolved solids, residual organic 
compounds and coloured compounds (Willmott, 1997). 
The final stages involve the discharge of the treated wastewater to the receiving 
water system and the removal of any resulting sludge for landfill. This method for 
the removal of colour of textile wastewaters falls into three categories, chemical 
methods, physical methods and biological methods (Slokar and Le Marechal, 1998; 
Chiavola, 2003). To achieve optimised colour removal, a combination of the 
different technologies is required, as much research into effective alternatives has 
shown (Bes-Pia et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2004; Chakraborty et al., 2005; He et al.. 
2007). 
The wastewaters from textile dyeing facilities are difficult to treat satisfactorily 
because of their high compositional variability and their possible (likely) high colour 
intensity. The colour of water that is polluted with organic colorants reduces 
following the cleavage of -C=C- or -N=N- double bonds or following heterocyclic 
and aromatic ring cleavage. Also, the colour of such species can be reduced as the 
absorption of light by associated molecular shifts from the visible region to the 
10 ultraviolet (UV) or infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum (Joshi and 
Purwar, 2004).

ý1 1.4.1 Physico-chemical processes for the treatment of coloured 
wastewater 
Some of the dyes that require disposal are of a non-biodegradable nature. Thus. 
direct biological treatment of the coloured effluents is neither appropriate nor 
effective (Torrades et al., 2004). Consequently, chemical and/or physical techniques 
have to be applied to achieve complete or partial degradation of the dyes. These 
techniques could be coupled with amendable secondary biological treatment, if 
required. The most commonly used physico-chemical treatment techniques for the 
treatment of coloured wastewaters are summarised in Table 1.4.2 (Slokar and Le 
Marechal, 1998; Robinson et al., 2001; Pearce, 2004; Husain, 2006; dos Santos et 
al., 2007). 
1.4.1.1 Advanced oxidative processes (AOPs) 
Advanced oxidative processes are the more commonly used chemically based 
decoloration methods. Chemical oxidation degrades the dye in the dye-containing 
effluent by oxidation, resulting in aromatic ring cleavage of the dye molecules. 
Advanced oxidative processes use either the hydroxyl radical ('OH) or the primary 
oxidant and include systems such as combinations of 03, H202 and UV radiation 
(Ledakowicz et al., 2001). Such systems have significant advantages over 
conventional treatment methods since this type of chemical oxidation does not result 
in large amounts of either chemical components or biological sludge. Also, almost 
complete demineralisation of organic species is possible (Azbar et al., 2004). 
However, chemical oxidative processes have disadvantages in the high cost of the 
reagents and of the energy sources. They also have problems in that partial oxidation 
could generate species that may be more harmful to the environment than those in 
the original effluent (Southern. 1995). The chemical decoloration methods may differ 
in the way in which hydrogen peroxide is activated. It has been shown that the 
advanced oxidative treatment of textile wastewaters enhanced the subsequent 
,2 biodegradation by increasing the bioavailability of the by-products to the degradative 
enzymes of the activated sludge. Also, a significant decrease in the inhibition of 
microbial growth has been observed (Ledakowicz et al.. 2001). 
Fenton's reagent (Fe2+/H2O2) 
Oxidation using Fenton's reagent (hydrogen peroxide, activated with Fee salts) is 
based on the generation of hydroxyl radicals from Fenton's reagent, when Fe(II) 
irons are oxidised by hydrogen peroxide and the hydroxyl radical, HO' is produced. 
This free radical attacks organic compounds and decomposes them chemically (van 
de Zee, 2002; Meric et al., 2005). These redox reactions can be expressed as follows: 
H202 + Fe 2+ -p Fe 3+ + OIL + 'OH 
RH+'OH-R'+H2O 
R'+Fe3+--+R++Fe2' 
R++H20 -ROH+H+ 
The Fenton process occurs primarily in the first stage of hydroxyl radical oxidation. 
The treatment is very effective in the decoloration of textile wastewaters (Kang et al.. 
2002). The Fenton process also offers advantages in the reduction of COD and in the 
reduction of toxicity (Slokar and Le Marechal, 1998). Compared with other oxidation 
processes, Fenton oxidation offers a cheaper means of coloured effluent treatment 
with advantages of easy operation, simplicity of the system and the possibility to 
work over a wide range of temperatures (Kim et al., 2004). The Fenton's treatment 
process consists of a combination of chemical oxidation and chemical coagulation of 
organic compounds. The drawback of this process is that the excessive generation of 
sludge causes problems in sludge separation during the subsequent treatments 
(Robinson ci al., 2001). 
Ozonation 
Ozone is a strong chemical oxidant \Vith a high oxidation potential (2.07 V), which 
allows ozone to degrade most organic compounds (Assalin et al.. 2004). Ozone may 
ý, ii attack pollutants via two different reaction pathways. These are direct ozonation by 
the ozone molecule and radical ozonation by hydroxyl free radical ('OH) species, 
generated in aqueous media (Shang et al., 2006). The decomposition of ozone in 
water has been well interpreted by Staehelin and Hoigne (1985) and can he 
summarised by the following reaction sequence (Selcuk, 2005): 
03+011- -+HO20+02 ' 
03+02-. -02+03-. 
O3-" +II +- O3. 
HO3'-HO '+O-, 
03+HO'ýH040 
H04 0 -p 02 + H02 
2HO4'-pH202+203 
HOI'+H03'-+ H202+02+03 
Ozone and/or hydroxyl free radicals are able to break the double bonds (-N=N-, 
-C=C-) in the long conjugated chains of the dye molecule. They were also reported 
to be able to open aromatic rings (Leshem et al., 2006; Assalin et al., 2004). During 
the ozonation process, dyes lose their colour by the oxidative cleavage of the 
chromophores. The cleavage of double bonds and/or other functional groups will 
shift the absorption spectra of the molecule out of the visible region (Sevimli and 
Kinaci, 2002). Ozonation is usually coupled with other oxidants such as hydrogen 
peroxide (H202) or UV irradiation, to enhance the formation of hydroxyl radicals in 
the aqueous phase. 
Ozonation can be used alone as a treatment process for the decoloration of textile 
wastewaters. Ozone converts the organic compounds into smaller (often 
biodegradable) molecules such as dicarboxylic acids and aldehydes. The reduction of 
the COD is, therefore, slight. Some of the ozonation products (especially the 
aldehydes) are highly toxic (van der Zee, 2002). The ozonation process has been 
34 used more widely as a potential alternative for decoloration and improvements to the 
biological degradation of textile effluents (Alvares et al.. 2001; Mantzavinos and 
Psillakis, 2004). 
One of the major advantages in using ozone is that it can be applied in the gaseous 
state and, therefore, does not increase the volume of wastewater and sludge. No 
chemical sludge is left in the treated effluent after the ozonation process is completed. 
The process has the potential to accomplish both colour removal and organic 
compound removal in one step (Soares et al., 2006). It can also remove many toxic 
chemicals from wastewaters to facilitate the decomposition of detergents, chlorinated 
hydrocarbons, phenols, pesticides and aromatic hydrocarbons (Slokar and Le 
Marechal, 1998). Another reason for the increased interest in the ozonation process is 
that recent, improved ozone generation systems require lower energies to generate 
ozone. Consequently, costs are reduced (Assalin et al., 2004). 
The main disadvantage of the ozone oxidising species is their short half-life, 
typically 20 minutes. This time can be further shortened if dyes are present. Their 
stability is also affected by the presence of salts and by the pH and temperature. In 
alkaline conditions, ozone decomposition is accelerated and a careful monitoring of 
the effluent pH is required (Robinson et al., 2001; Assalin et al., 2004). It is known 
that continued ozonation generally leads to an increase in biodegradability of the 
treatment wastewaters (Liakou et al., 2003). Ozonation is an effective approach to 
the destruction of a broad range of recalcitrant organic compounds and of inorganic 
compounds. However, their degradation in the form of complex mixtures results in a 
large organic load that remains, as represented by high COD and total organic carbon 
(TOC) residuals. even at high doses of ozone. Thus, processing may require elevated 
detection times, which will increase the cost of treatment considerably (Ledakowicz 
and Gonera, 1999, Arslan-Alaton and Seremet, 2004). 
A comparison of the decoloration of an azo dye. Orange II. was carried out involving 
wet oxidation processes and ozonation. It was found that ozonation provides good 
results in decoloration but requires coupling with biological processes. due to the 
35 persistence of intermediates that tend remain in the solution (Kurpik and Gobec. 
2003). The decoloration of three dyes (C. I. Acid Blue 113. C. I. Reactive Red 241 
and C. I. Basic Red 14) was studied by the means of ozonation. The wet oxidation 
process decolorised all of the solutions but the removal of TOC was not satisfactorily 
achieved (Faria et al., 2005). 
Photochemical AOPs 
Photochemical AOPs are ultraviolet radiation (200-280 nm) driven, Advanced 
Oxidation Processes that are primarily based on the generation of powerful oxidising 
species either through direct photolysis or via photo-induced processes or 
photocatalysis (Stefan, 2004). The major photochemical AOPs involve UV/03 
(Azbar et al., 2004; Shu, 2006), photo-Fenton's (Aplin and Waite, 2000: Huang et al.. 
2007), UV/H202 and UV/Ti02 processes. The mechanisms of the UV/03 process and 
of the photo-Fenton's process are similar to those mentioned in the references to the 
use of Fenton's reagent and ozonation. 
The UV/H202 process, using ultraviolet radiation (UV) in the presence of hydrogen 
peroxide is a very promising AOP technology for the decoloration of textile 
wastewaters. UV wavelengths in the range of 200-280 nm lead to cleavage of H202, 
with a mercury lamp emitting at 254 nm being the most commonly used (Bali, 2004). 
This process involves photolysis of H202 and yields reactive and non-selective 
hydroxyl radicals ('OH) by a direct process, with a yield of two radicals formed per 
photon absorbed, as shown in the scheme below: 
H2O, + by -* 2HO ' 
The UV/H202 technique is able to eliminate residual dyestuffs in the dyeing 
wastewaters with high colour removal efficiency. It has been claimed that no sludge 
is produced (Shu et al., 1994, Fung et al., 2001: Georgiou et al., 2002). It has been 
suggested that this process can be the basis of a suitable pre-treatment method for 
systems that are aimed at the complete decoloration and detoxification of effluents 
from textile dyeing and finishing processes, once the optimum operating conditions 
36 are established (Ince and Gönenc. 1997). An advantage of this process is that no 
additional disposal problems are involved after treatment. This is because the organic 
components in the water are almost completely destroyed while removing the colour 
(Kurbus et al., 2003). However, in the decoloration of reactive azo dyes, it was 
reported that, with an increasing number of azo groups, the decoloration efficiency of 
the UV/H202 process decreased (Fung et al.. 2001). The kinetics and the 
mineralisation of reactive azo dyes using UV/H202 are well documented (El-Dein et 
al., 2001; Neamtu et al., 2002). The mechanisms are summarised in the following 
reactions: 
Dye + by --). Intermediates (Equation 1) 
H202 + by -* 2HO ' (Equation 2) 
Dye + HO'-4 Products (P) (Equation 3) 
P+ HO ' final products (Equation 4) 
HO '+ H202 - H02'+ H2O (Equation 5) 
It was reported that the direct photolysis of the dye (Equation 1) is not negligible but 
is very slow. The decoloration is enhanced by the presence of H202 due to the 
hydroxyl radicals that are generated during the photochemical reactions. According 
to Neamtu et al. (2002), the experimental results show a dependence of the 
decolorising degree on the initial concentration of the hydrogen peroxide. Excess 
H202 consumes the reactive HO' radicals to give less reactive hydroperoxy (H02') 
radicals, as illustrated above in (Equation 5). It was also found that the UV/H202 
process is very dependent on the pH and on the dye concentration (Schrank et al.. 
2007). The UV/H202 method has been successfully used for the decoloration of acid 
dyes, direct dyes, basic dyes and reactive dyes but has proven to be inadequate for 
the decoloration of vat dyes and some disperse dyes (Forgacs et al., 2004). 
In recent years, effort has been devoted to the study of photochemical processes 
using semiconductor oxides, e. g. the UV/Ti02 system, for the treatment of textile 
Nvastcwatcrs (Fernandez et al.. 2004; Liu and Chiou. 2005; Alinsafi et al. 2007). The 
37 
L EED6 UIVIVEHSITY LIB photocatalytic Ti02 process involves the formation of conduction-band electrons (e'-) 
and valence-band holes (ht). The mechanisms are summarised below: 
Ti02 + by -+ [Ti02 (e) +(h+)] (Equation a) 
02 + Ti02 (e) -+ Ti02 + 02' - (Equation b) 
Ti02 (h+) + H20-+ Ti02 + HO '+ H+ (Equation c) 
Ti02 (h+) + Dye --> Products (Equation d) 
HO + Dye -+ Degradation intermediates (Equation e) 
-pCO2+H20+Salts 
It has been shown that the use of Ti02 in such oxidations could provide decoloration 
and increases the biodegradability of the textile wastewater in colour removal 
treatments. It was observed that the effectiveness was strongly dependent on the 
chemical structure of the dyes (Alinsafi et al., 2007). TiO2 photocatalysis can be 
considered to be an emerging wastewater treatment technology. The key advantages 
include the lack of mass transfer limitations, the feasibility of operation under 
ambient conditions and the possible use of solar irradiation (Pekakis et al., 2006). 
The photocatalytic removal of colour from textile effluents using Ti02 suspension 
has been studied (Prieto et al., 2005). Efficient decoloration of the effluent was 
established, though the flow rate affected the colour removal rate. Two reactive azo 
dyes C. I. Reactive Black 5 and C. I. Reactive Yellow 145 were degraded using the 
UV/TiO2 system. It was concluded that the solutions of the two selected azo dyes 
were successfully mineralised using Ti02 media that were coated on paper substrates 
to an optimal initial loading (Aguedach, 2005). 
Other AOPs and the application of combinations of AOPs 
Gamma irradiation has been applied to the decoloration and degradation of reactive 
dyes in aqueous solution (Solpan and Güven. 2002). The dye solutions can be 
decolorised with addition of an oxidising agent and a decolorising agent. Ultrasonic 
38 irradiation of synthetic dyes has been studied as a support to alternative advanced 
oxidation processes. Tezcanli-Guyer and Ince (2003) studied the degradation of 
reactive dyes and of basic dyes in deionised water solutions using 520 kHz ultrasonic 
irradiation. The degradation of azo dyes and oxazine dyes is indicated by colour 
decay, followed by destruction of the organic dye molecule by the ultrasonically 
generated hydroxyl radicals. Decoloration of six vinylsulphone reactive dyes, each in 
aqueous solution, was evaluated using ultrasound and ultrasound/H2O2 degradation 
(Voncina and Majcen-Le-Marechal, 2003). The application of ultrasound/H202 
provided superior decoloration relative to the use of ultrasound or sonolysis alone. 
An investigation of the decoloration of C. I. Reactive Black 5 using a combination of 
ultrasound and ozone has been made. The dye solution was decolorised but without 
satisfactory removal of TOC (He et al., 2007). A drawback in the use of ultrasound 
options is the high energy input in the application. It has been claimed that the 
technique might also produce toxic compounds during the treatment (Husain, 2006). 
The chemical oxidation of coloured wastewaters can be induced by the use of sodium 
hypochlorite (NaOC1). This reactive species attacks the dye molecule, initiating and 
accelerating the subsequent azo bridge cleavage. Treatments involving the use of 
NaOC1 in the decoloration of reactive dyes required longer times, while solutions of 
metal-complex dyes remained partially coloured. Disperse dyes cannot be 
decolorised by this method. The use of this approach has become less frequent due to 
the impact of chlorine in the environment and the possible release of carcinogenic 
compounds (Slokar and Le Marechal, 1998; Robinson et al., 2001). 
A comparison of various advanced oxidation processes, (03,03/UV, H202/UV, 
03/H, 02/UV, Fee+/H2O2), in the colour removal from a polyester and acetate fibre 
dyeing effluent was undertaken (Azbar et al., 2004). The use of the Fee+/H2O2 
system seemed to achieve a satisfactory COD and colour removal performance and 
to be an economically viable choice. The application of advanced oxidative 
processes, prior to biodegradation. showed that the most advisable advanced 
oxidative process was that of ozonation combined with UV radiation or the 
,9 combination of 03/H202/UV, giving a similar result to that which Ledako«icz and 
Gonera (1999) found. Processes such as UV/Ti02, electro-Fenton (EF). wet-air 
oxidation (WAO) and UV/electro-Fenton (UV/EF) have been applied to the 
degradation of a solution of C. I. Reactive Red 120. The decoloration efficiency was 
observed to be in the order of WAO > UV/Ti02 = UV/EF > EF, while the total 
organic carbon (TOC) removal was in the order of WAO > UV/Ti02 > UV/EF > EF 
(Kusvuran et al., 2004). Mantzavinos and Psillakis (2004) have reviewed 
developments and addressed some important aspects of chemical oxidation as a 
pre-treatment before the biological post-treatment of industrial wastewaters is 
undertaken. 
1.4.1.2 Reductive processes 
The primary degradation and decoloration of dyes with azo-based chromophores can 
be achieved by the reduction of the azo bond (-N=N-), using strong reducing agents 
such as sodium hydrosulphite, thiourea dioxide, sodium formaldehyde sulphoxylate 
and sodium borohydride (Delee et al., 1998). Such processes have received less 
attention, perhaps due to cost factors, difficulties in handling and problems 
associated with the degradation by-products. 
1.4.1.3 Electrochemical processes 
Electrochemical treatments principally concern the passage of an electric current 
resulting in different chemical situations. The resultant reactions following/during 
the electrochemical treatment of wastewater are electro-coagulation, 
electro-flotation, electro-oxidation and electro-reduction (Hao et al., 2000: 
Fongsatitkul et al., 2006). Electrochemical decoloration could be achieved either by' 
reduction or by oxidation. In the case of the decoloration of azo dyes. the 
chromophore of azo dyes is broken to generate two amino groups by the means of 
electrochemical reduction (L6pez-Grimau and Gutierrez. 2006). It has been proposed 
that dye molecule degradation by electrochemical oxidation occurs in two stages. In 
40 the first stage, anodic electrolysis of water results in the formation of hydroxyl 
radicals that are adsorbed onto the active site of the electrode. In the second stage. 
the dye molecules are oxidised by the adsorbed hydroxyl radicals that are continually 
formed at the anode (Leshem et al., 2006). 
Electrochemical oxidation is claimed to be a relatively easy process to operate. The 
process does not require the use of extra oxidants or other chemicals, as is required 
by the chemical pre-treatment for industrial effluents (Mantzavinos and Psillakis, 
2004). Electrochemical oxidation provides certain advantages that include almost 
complete decoloration, operation under moderate pH ranges, low final temperatures. 
significant COD and BOD reductions as well as no sludge formation (Sakalis et al., 
2005). However, in solutions such as textile wastewaters that typically contain 
chloride ions, the dominant process is through indirect oxidation by various forms of 
chlorine. The possibility of the production of high levels of total organic halides and 
the high cost of electricity contribute to the- disadvantages for this technique 
(Robinson et al., 2001; Sakalis et al., 2005). 
An electrochemical method that employs Ti/Pt as the anode and Stainless Steel 304 
as the cathode, with NaCl as the electrolyte solution, has been used for the treatment 
of both total effluent and effluent from the dyeing stage only from cellulosic reactive 
azo dyeing processes. The data obtained showed that the COD, biochemical oxygen 
demand reduction and colour reduction exceeded 80% in almost all cases (Vlyssides 
el al., 2000). Moreover, the electrochemical oxidation of dyes can also be assisted by 
photocatalysis (Osugi et al., 2005; Lopez-Grimau and Gutierrez, 2006). 
1.4.1.4 Coagulation/ flocculation processes 
Advanced oxidation processes are effective in wastewaters that contain very low 
concentrations of organic dyes. Thus. significant dilution or balancing is necessary as 
a facility requirement. One difference between coagulation/flocculation processes 
and AOPs is that the coagulation and flocculation processes are in extensive use for 
the pre-, main or post- treatments. Also, full decoloration is possible by such 
41 processes (Papis et al.. 2004). The use of the coagulation and flocculation in textile 
wastewater treatment is centred on the decoloration of the waste stream through the 
removal of dye molecules from the effluents, and not through a partial decomposition 
of dyes. A disadvantage that comes with this process is the high production of 
sludge. 
Surfactants and dyes with high molecular weights can be successfully removed by a 
coagulation/flocculation processes followed by sedimentation, flotation and filtration, 
or use prior to biological treatment, respectively. The coagulation/flocculation 
method has been examined as a wastewater treatment technique for the decoloration 
of residual dyebath effluents after the dyeing of cotton/polyamide blends, using 
reactive and acid dyes, has been carried out. Almost complete decoloration has been 
achieved. Thus, the total organic carbon (TOC), chemical oxygen demand (COD), 
adsorbed organic halides (AOX), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and anionic 
surfactants loads were reduced and the biodegradability was increased (Golob et al., 
2005). Coagulant dose and coagulation pH are important factors in influencing the 
mechanism and the extent of coagulation. Also, the type and chemical structure of 
the dye plays an important role in the effectiveness of the coagulation process. 
Chemical coagulation has been used to remove disperse dyes and reactive dyes. 
Compared with reactive dyes, disperse dyes have lower solubility, higher suspended 
solids concentrations and lower (soluble COD)/ (total COD) ratios. In one study, it 
was concluded that disperse dye dispersions were more easily decolorised by 
chemical coagulation than were reactive dye solutions (Kim et al., 2004). 
A polymer coagulant was synthesised from cyanoguanidine and formaldehyde and 
the product applied to the treatment of reactive dyes. C. I. Reactive Black 5, C. I. 
Reactive Blue 2, C. I. Reactive Red 2 and C. I. Reactive Yellow 2 were nearly 
completely removed from solution using the inorganic coagulants and the polymeric 
coagulants, in combination, within required pH range. The combination system 
resulted in much better colour removal than was provided by the inorganic coagulant 
42 system alone. The colour removal rate from real dyeing wastewater was not as great 
it was in model wastewater systems, up to 62% (Joo et al.. 2007). 
The processes often use conventional coagulants such as potassium alums and 
aluminium chloride as the coagulant of choice. The use of alum, aluminium chloride 
and other required chemicals for conventional water treatment may be considered as 
a high cost approach in some countries. There is also the possibility that a secondary 
pollution problem will arise because of the excessive chemical use (Sanghi ct al., 
2006). Magnesium chloride has been shown to be an effective alternative to 
conventional coagulants. The magnesium based by-products can be removed from 
the precipitated sludge and recycled. Therefore, there is a reduction in the chemical 
costs and sludge disposal problems that are associated with the use of many 
conventional coagulants (Tan et al., 2000; Gao et al., 2007). Several natural. 
economic and environmentally friendly materials have been identified and applied in 
the coagulation and flocculation processes (Sanghi et al., 2006). 
Electrocoagulation has been successfully applied to colour removal from 
wastewaters (Alinsafi et al., 2005). This procedure offers some advantages over the 
conventional coagulation methods. These include the fact that many of the processes 
can be simple and easy to operate, have no requirement of addition of chemicals. 
operate with a shorter reaction time, and also give a lower sludge production. 
However, several parameters such as, the shape and distance between electrodes, the 
cell potential, the conductivity, the pH and the fact that the system should be handled 
xv-ith care to optimise the efficiency of the process (Alinsafi et al., 2005; Caflizares et 
al., 2006), need to be given attention. 
1.4.1.5 Adsorption treatments 
Physical adsorption is widely used in the treatment of wastewaters because of its 
simplicity and the fact that the processes are economically feasible. Activated carbon 
has been used as an adsorbent extensively in textile wastewater treatment, either 
independently or coupled with biological degradation (Abu-Salah et al., 1996). This 
43 popularity is mainly due to the well-developed porous internal structure of the 
activated carbons and their various surface functional groups. Hence. they have 
remarkable adsorption properties. Activated carbon provides one of the more 
efficient techniques of dyehouse wastewater treatment, especially as a final polishing 
step before discharging or recycling the treated wastewater (Yang and Al-Duri, 
2005). Despite its importance, activated carbon is an expensive material and is 
difficult to regenerate after use. This has led to a search for low-cost materials as 
alternatives. These include fly ash (Eren and Acar, 2006), coal-based bottom ash 
(Dinger et al., 2006), chitin (Akkaya et al., 2007), narrow-leaved cattail (Inthorn et 
al., 2004), coir pith activated carbon (Santhy and Selvapathy, 2006), titania-silica 
mesoporous materials (Messina and Schulz, 2006), and many other effective 
adsorbents (Hu, 1996; Tsui et al., 2003; Dincer et al., 2006). These authors have 
shown that the approaches have considerable potential. 
Chitosan offers a cheaper and better adsorbent in comparison with many adsorbents 
particularly in the adsorption of heavy metals and acidic dyestuffs from aqueous 
solution. Effective colour removal of C. I. Reactive Black 5 has been achieved with 
control of the chitosan dosage and the pH of the treating system at high temperatures 
(Sakkayawong et al., 2005; Guibal and Roussy, 2007). Adsorbents, such as pine 
sawdust and polyamide-epichlorohydrin-cellulose polymers, have been applied 
successfully in removal of metal-complex dyes from aqueous solutions (Hwang and 
Chen, 1993; Özacar and $engyl, 2005). 
1.1.1.6 Ion exchange treatments 
Ion exchange is a process in which ions are exchanged between a solution and an ion 
exchanger, an insoluble solid or gel. Typical ion exchangers are ion exchange resins. 
zeolites, montmorillonites, clays, and humus. Ion exchangers are either cation 
exchangers for positively charged cations or anion exchangers for negatively charged 
anions. Ion exchange is a reversible process and the ion exchanger can be 
regenerated or loaded by washing with an excess of the ions to be exchanged. Ion 
44 exchange has not been widely used for the treatment of dye-containing effluents. A 
major disadvantage is the cost. since the system requires the use of organic solvents 
for the regeneration of the ion-exchanger which are expensive (Slokar and Le 
Marechal, 1998). Advantages of this method include the fact that there is no loss of 
adsorbent on regeneration, reclamation of solvent after use and the removal of 
soluble dyes (Robinson et al. 2001). 
1.4.1.7 Membrane processes 
The membrane techniques employed in textile effluent treatment involve one or more 
of reverse osmosis, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration and microfiltration. The 
classification of membranes is largely based on their pore size and their ability to 
retain solutes with different molecular weights cutoff (Hao et al., 2000). 
Reverse osmosis membranes are effective for most types of ionic compounds and 
produce a high quality of permeate. Decoloration and the elimination of chemical 
auxiliaries in dye-house wastewater can be carried out in a single step. (Allegre et al., 
2006). Reverse osmosis permits the removal of all mineral salts, hydrolysed reactive 
dyes and chemical auxiliaries. The problem involved is that the higher the 
concentration of salt, the more important the osmotic pressure becomes and, 
therefore, the greater is the energy that is required. High osmotic pressure differences 
limit the applicability of reverse osmosis membranes. Reverse osmosis membrane 
filtration has problems with fouling, which result in low fluxes and poor separation 
efficiency (Tang and Chen, 2002; Kim et al., 2005). 
Nanofiltration membranes have applications in the separation of the soluble dye 
residues, e. g. nanofiltration membranes are able to reject dyes and other organic 
molecules, while allowing NaCI and other monovalent salts pass through the 
membrane at the permeate stream (Koyuncu et al., 2004). Compared with reverse 
osmosis membranes, nanofiltration membranes possess a looser structure. Because of 
this, nanofiltration membranes can be operated at a lower pressure. while still 
providing a high flux (Jiraratananon et al.. ? 000). 
45 Ultrafiltration has not been widely accepted by the textile industry since it makes 
direct water reuse impossible and requires further filtration by either nanofiltration or 
reverse osmosis (Tang and Chen. 2002). Ultrafiltration enables the elimination of 
macromolecules and particles but the elimination of polluting substances, such as 
colour is never complete. The possibility of retaining bifuntional reactive dyes by 
ultrafiltration was studied by Petrov and Stoychev (2003). Polv(acrylonitrile) and 
related poly(acrylonitrile)-co-polymeric membranes were used. It was found out that 
the membrane itself affects the process both through its pore size and the 
characteristics of the co-monomers in the polymer. The micellar-enhanced 
ultrafiltration of C. I. Reactive Black 5 and C. I. Reactive Orange 16 dyes in solutions 
containing cetylpyridinium chloride, using 10,000 thin-film composite membranes 
was studied. The reactive dyes were removed under a suitable operating pressure 
(Ahmad, 2006). 
Microfiltration is suitable for concentrating colloidal dyes such as sulphur dyes, vat 
dyes and azoic dyes as well as subsequent rinsing baths while the auxiliary chemicals 
remain in the permeate (Muhammad et al., 1997; Akbari et al., 2006). Both 
ultrafiltration and microfiltration have an advantage in the low pressure required 
compared with reverse osmosis and nanofiltration. However, the drawback for these 
two methods is the insufficient quality of treated wastewater. 
Filtration technologies require a high initial setup cost. These are overweighed by the 
significant cost saving achieved through reuse of permeate (Ahmad, 2006). One 
severe limitation of the application of filtration technologies is the disposal of the 
retentate or concentrate stream. At the moment, the retentate stream is disposed of by 
evaporation, incineration or discharging into the ocean (Tang and Chen, 2002). Kim 
ct al. (2004) have applied a membrane bioreactor using white-rot fungi for the 
decoloration of reactive dye solutions. It was found that most of the dye was 
decolorised by the white-rot fungus, Trametes versicolor. -while most of the TOC 
was removed by the reverse osmosis membrane process. 
In all of the processes of colour removal, four facts need to be considered. These are: 
46 1. The fact that the dye effluent will quite likely contain more than one 
chromophoric type. Thus, non-specificity of action of favoured. 
2. Whatever treatment process is chosen, it must be capable of delivering rapid rates 
of decoloration so that large throughputs can be catered for. This allows for more 
efficient and more cost effective operations. 
3. Biomass creation should be controllable (steady state in effect) and limited. 
4. Adsorption related processes can still present problems that are associated with 
the handling and the treatment of coloured species. even though these species can 
be quite lightly bound to the support. 
1.4.2 Biological processes for the treatment of coloured wastewater 
Willmott el al., 1998 have concluded that only biotechnological solutions can offer 
complete destruction of the dyestuff, with a co-reduction in the biological oxygen 
demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). Biological treatments in the 
decoloration of textile wastewaters offer potential advantages over the other 
treatments that were introduced in Section 1.4.1. Biological treatments tend to 
"destroy" the pollutants rather than concentrate them. In addition, the 
biotechnological approach makes feasible the efficient use of the limited 
development space available in many traditional dyehouse sites. As a result, less 
sludge is created. Lower operational costs and less health and safety risks are also 
advantages of biological treatments over other physical and chemical treatments. 
Moreover, microbes have the ability, in colour removal, of adaptation, i. e. they can 
be used in the treatment of a wide range of new synthetic compounds. 
Many microorganisms including bacteria, fungi, yeast and algae are capable of 
decolorising a wide range of dyes via the appropriate processes. Applications of 
fungi and bacteria in colour removal of textile wastewaters are considered below. 
47 1.4.2.1 Colour removal of textile wastewaters involving fungi 
The most extensively studied dye-deco lori sing microorganisms are the white-rot 
fungi. Phanerochaete chrysosporium and Trametes versicolor are the major 
white-rot fungal strains that have been used that are able to degrade a variety of 
complex aromatic compounds, such as dyes, that usually would be recalcitrant to 
biodegradation, all the way to carbon dioxide (Aksu et al., 2007). The ability of 
white-rot fungi to degrade a wide range of recalcitrant dyes has generally been 
associated with their production of ligninolytic enzymes that are highly oxidative and 
substrate non-specific. The lignin-modifying enzymes typically include lignin 
peroxidase, manganese peroxidase and laccase (Maximo and Costa-Ferreira, 2004). 
Phanerochaete chrysosporium produces extracellular lignin peroxidase and 
manganese peroxidase during the degradation of lignin or xenobiotic compounds. 
Lignin peroxidase catalyses the oxidation of non-phenolic aromatic compounds 
directly. Manganese peroxidase oxidises Mn(II) to Mn(III), which is responsible for 
the oxidation of many phenolic compounds. Lignin peroxidase has higher oxidation 
potentials than manganese peroxidase (Harazono et al., 2003). There are two major 
problems in the application of Phanerochaete chrysosporium in the treatment of real 
wastewaters (Rai et al., 2005). Firstly, the lignin peroxidase, for dye degradation, is 
released by fungal cells following a strict secondary metabolism under either carbon 
or nitrogen limitation. This means that the presence of a carbon or a nitrogen nutrient 
in the industrial effluent would prohibit the release of this enzyme by the fungal cells. 
Secondly, dye degradation by lignin peroxidase consumes considerable amounts of 
hydrogen peroxide and veratryl alcohol as reagents. Although veratryl alcohol is a 
metabolite released by the fungus, a large amount of hydrogen peroxide, veratryl 
alcohol and lignin peroxidase may not be produced simultaneously in most industrial 
effluents (Rai et al., 2005). Moreover, since fungi decolorise dyes in secondary 
metabolism and dyes cannot be utilised as the primary carbon source for fungi 
growth. a primary carbon source such as glucose is necessary in fungal dye 
48 decoloration. In the absence of glucose, almost all fungi have no decoloration 
capability (Sanghi, 2006). 
Compared to Phanerochaete "chrysosporium, Trametes versicolor offers some 
distinct advantages. Trametes versicolor can produce the oxidative enzyme, laccase, 
an extracellular oxidase, even in the presence of nitrogen and carbon nutrients. More 
importantly, laccase can catalyse the oxidation of organic pollutants even in the 
absence of hydrogen peroxide or other secondary metabolites. Laccase needs 02 to 
catalyse the oxidation reaction. Various redox mediators have been reported to play 
an important role in the oxidation phenolic compounds (Rai et al., 2005). The single 
and combined effects of chromium (VI) and Remazol Black B reactive dye on the 
chromium (VI) and dye removal properties of adapted Trametes versicolor was 
investigated in a batch system, at different levels of chromium (VI) and dye. The 
growing white-rot fungus Trametes versicolor was shown to be capable of 
accumulating chromium (VI) and decolorising the Remazol Black B reactive dye, 
both singly and in combination in a batch process. Special nutrients and low pH 
(4-4.5) requirements for the optimum activity of the enzymes and long 
biodegradation time are the disadvantages of fungal bioremediation (Aksu et al., 
2007). 
Intensive studies using white-rot fungi in the decoloration of textile wastewaters have 
been carried out. Unlike Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Irpex lacteus produces high 
levels of lignin-modifying enzymes in media that contain high nitrogen levels. It has 
been shown that when Irpex lacteirs was grown in a N-limited medium, no lignin 
peroxidase was formed and low levels of manganese perosidases and laccase were 
found (Maximo and Costa-Ferreira, 2004). The selected reactive dyes were 
decolorised successfully with Irpex lacteus. 18 fungal strains that were able to 
degrade lignocellulosic material or lignin derivatives were tested with the azo dyes 
C. I. Reactive Orange 96, C. I. Reactive Violet 5 and C. I. Reactive Black 5. Only the 
white-rot fungal strains of Bjerkandera adusta, Trametes versicolor and 
Phancrochuctt' chrl-sosporiimn were able to decolorise all of the azo dyes (Heinfling 
49 et al., 1997). The white rot fungus Coriolus versiclolor could decolorise the reactive 
dye Remazol Brilliant Violet to almost 90%. The fungal mycelia removed colour as 
well as COD up to 95% and 75%, respectively, in a batch reactor (Sanghi. 2006). 
Three types of reactive dyes, C. I. Reactive Blue 19. C. I. Reactive Blue 49 and C. I. 
Reactive Black 5 were decolorised with a membrane bioreactor which contained the 
white-rot fungus, Trametes versicolor KCTC 16781. and reverse osmosis 
membrance filtration were combined. The decoloration efficiencies were 99.1 %. 
76.9% and 100.0% respectively, for C. I. Reactive Black 5, C. I. Reactive Blue 19 and 
C. I. Reactive Blue 49 (Kim et al., 2004). The white-rot fungus Phanerochaete 
sordida strain YK-624 was isolated from decayed wood obtained from a forest that 
has been found to secrete manganese peroxidase. The decoloration of an azo-reactive 
dye, C. I. Reactive Red 120, by a white-rot basidiomycete, Phanerochaete sordida 
strain YK-624, was investigated. 90.6% of dye was decolorised after 7 days. 
(Harazono et al., 2003). Decoloration of 1: 2 metal-complex azo dye, C. I. Acid Blue 
193, was carried out by a white rot fungus Cladosporium Cladosporioides and 80% 
of colour removal was achieved (Vijaykumar, 2006). 
1.4.2.2 Colour removal of textile wastewaters involving bacteria 
Long growth cycles and moderate decoloration rates limit the performance of fungal 
decoloration systems. In contrast, colour removal of textile wastewaters using 
bacterial cells has been considered as a faster, more cost-effective and more 
environmental friendly technique. Such approaches have received extensive interest 
(Chen, 2002: Pearce et al., 2003). The biological removal of the dyes from effluents 
from the textile and dyestuff manufacturing industries can be broadly classified into 
three categories: aerobic treatments, anaerobic treatments and combined 
anaerobic-aerobic treatments (Rai et al., 2005). Comparisons between the aerobic 
treatments (processes using oxygen) and the anaerobic treatments (processes that do 
no use oxygen) are summarised in Table 1.4.3.

Aerobic treatment processes 
The conventional activated sludge treatment of wastes offers effective and highly 
economic systems for reducing organic pollutants in wastewater. Much research has 
been conducted using activated sludges in the colour removal from textile effluents 
(Gulnaz et al., 2006). Wang et al. (1999) have decolorised up to 94% of methyl 
violet waste water using cattle dung slurry as the source of activated sludge and coal 
powder as the biological carrier. However, the aerobic treatment of azo dye wastes 
has proven to be ineffective in most cases. None-the-less, this is often the typical 
method of treatment used today (Wallace, 2001). Textile dyeing wastewater cannot 
be readily degraded by the activated sludge process. This is because the structures of 
most commercial dye compounds are generally very complex. Many dyes are 
non-biodegradable due to their chemical nature and their molecular size. Thus, 
sludge bulking occurs (Kim et al., 2004). The adsorption of various hues on activated 
sludge has been examined (Skelly, 2003). The highly soluble acid dyes and reactive 
dyes have a very low degree of adsorption. Basic dyes typically give high levels of 
adsorption. Disperse dyes undergo adsorption in the high to medium range and direct 
dyes have a high degree of adsorption. 
The decoloration of dyes by bacteria can be due to adsorption to microbial cells and 
to biodegradation (Ren et al., 2006). In adsorption, bacterial cells become coloured 
5l because of the adsorbing dyes. In biodegradation they remain their original colour. 
Several bacterial cultures have been applied aerobically. in the decoloration of the 
dye-containing systems, as adsorbents in biosorption. Three Gram-negative bacteria: 
Aeromonas sp. (isolated from soil). Pseudomonas luteola (isolated from an activated 
sludge that had been acclimated to the dyeing wastewater) and Escherichia coli, and 
two Gram-positive bacteria: Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus and a mixed 
biomass of activated sludge are the tested biosorbents have been reported to be 
capable of removing colour from aqueous solutions of the reactive dyes by 
bio-adsorption (Hu, 1996). Not all of the Gram-negative genera have the dye 
adsorption capability, the biosorption is specific. Moreover, the dead cells of 
Gram-negative bacteria have a higher specific adsorption capacity than occurs with 
the living cells. 
Several bacterial strains have been reported to be capable of decolorising dyes 
aerobically, by reductive mechanisms (Chang et al., 2001; Senan and Abraham, 2004; 
Kodam et al., 2005; Olukanni et al. 2006; Ren et al., 2006). A newly isolated 
Aeromonas hydrophila strain has been found that can decolorise triphenylmethyl 
dyes and anthraquinone dyes aerobically (Ren et al. 2006). Olukanni et al. (2006) 
have examined the aerobic decoloration of stimulated textile effluents of reactive 
dyes using eighteen organisms belonging to the genera, Bacillus, Acinetobacter, 
Legionella, Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas that were isolated from the textile 
effluents and six organisms belonging to the genus Balics that were isolated from a 
landfill site. The effluent-adapted stains have shown a better potential in 
bioremediative uses, with an average decoloration extent of -40%, which is not very 
efficient. Some aerobic bacteria are able to reduce azo compounds and produce 
aromatic amines. Organisms such as Bacillus subtillis, Aeromonas hydrophilia and 
Flavobatei-ium can reduce aerobically, specific azo dyes (Kamilaki, 2000). Bacterial 
strains have been described that can aerobically decolorise azo dyes and have been 
considered by Banat et al. (1996) and by Stolz (2001). 
;ý Anaerobic treatment processes 
The efficacy of anaerobic treatment applications in the colour removal from textile 
dye effluents has been many times demonstrated. Biological anaerobic treatment has 
shown superior abilities in colour removal compared to conventional physical 
chemical processes. Anaerobic biological processes provide rapid decoloration of a 
wide range of dyestuffs and also offer cost-effective and environmentally safe 
options. Anaerobic treatment is considered as the cheaper alternative because 
expensive aeration is omitted and problems with bulking sludge are avoided. There is 
a wide range of organisms that are able to reduce the dyes under anaerobic 
conditions. 
Various organisms have been applied anaerobically to the decoloration of textile dye 
effluents. This has been shown for single cultures, mixed cultures and in the 
application of anaerobic sludge. Twenty selected azo dyes were decolorised 
completely by anaerobic granular sludge due to non-specific extracellular reactions 
(van der Zee et al. 2001). C. I. Acid Orange 7 and C. I. Reactive Black 8 have been 
decolorised by seed sludge under anaerobic conditions (Manu and Chaudhari, 2002). 
The feasibility of the anaerobic sludge use, in this context, has been also proven by 
Mendez-Paz el al. (2005). C. I. Acid Orange 7 can be degraded as a sole carbon 
source by methanogenic granular sludge. The decoloration rate becomes even higher 
when an additional carbon source is added. Song et al. (2003) have investigated 
some selected azo dyes for decoloration by Rhodobacter sphaeroides. The results 
have shown that the selected azo dyes can be decolorised by more than 90% under 
anaerobic conditions and with addition of a carbon source such as peptone. 
Rodopseudomonas illustres is capable of possessing azoreductase activity to 
decolorise azo dyes under strict anaerobic conditions (Liu el al 2006).. 1 cromonas 
hvclropphila strain has been applied to the decoloration of azo dye solutions under 
anaerobic conditions. Rapidly effective decoloration of azo dye solutions has been 
observed (Ren et al. 2006). Handayani et al. (2007) have used Enterococcu. s iic'cal is 
53 to treat the dye solutions of C. I. Acid Red 27 and C. I. Reactive Red 2. High 
decoloration efficiencies. -95-100%, can be achieved. Xu et al. have isolated a 
highly efficient dye decolorising bacterium, Shewanella decolorationis S 12, and 
have proven that the bacterium can remove more than 99% of selected anthraquinone 
dyes, in solutions, under anaerobic conditions (Xu et al., 2005; Xu et al., 2006). 
Willmott and Guthrie (1997) have isolated Shewanella strain J 18 143. This culture 
has been effectively applied to the decoloration of reactive azo dyes and selected 
pigments (Willmott, 1997). More literature concerning the application of Shewanella 
species will be given in Section 1.4.3. 
The decoloration of dyes using pure cultures is often impractical as most of the 
isolated cultures are dye specific. Hence, their application on a large scale is 
impractical. This is because to maintain the pure form in a wastewater treatment 
plant is difficult (Manu and Chaudhari, 2002). Mixed bacterial cultures offer better 
prospects of serving as an excellent biosystem for use in reactive dye removal from 
wastewaters, under anaerobic conditions (cetin and Dönmez, 2006). A selected 
reactive monoazo dye (Everzol Red RBN), a reactive disazo dye (Drimaren Orange 
KGL) and a direct disazo dye (Everdirect Supra Yellow PG) have been decolorised 
effectively by a mixed anaerobic bacterial culture (Kapdan et al., 2000). However, 
the mixed culture was not effective for all of the selected dyes. Khehra et al. (2005) 
have studied the decoloration of the effluents of six dyes, C. I. Acid Red 88, C. I. Acid 
Red 119, C. I. Acid Red 97, C. I. Reactive Red 120, C. I. Acid Blue 113 and C. I. Acid 
Brown 100 using single cultures of Stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila, Pseudomonas 
putida, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Bacillus cereus, and a mixed culture of these 
four isolates. The individual isolates only completely decolorised C. I. Acid Red 119 
and C. I. Acid Brown 100. The consortium was able to decolorise all of the dyes at a 
higher decoloration rate compared to that achieved by the individual species. The 
anaerobic biological decoloration of an anthraquinone dye (C. I. Reactive Blue 19) 
and that of a. phthalocyanine dye (C. I. Reactive Blue 21) using a suspended- grog\-th. 
halophilic mixed culture fed with glucose, under hypersaline conditions, was 
54 achieved to the extent of 87% and 37% respectively (Lee et al., 2005). Information 
concerning other research that has been done, relating to the anaerobic decoloration 
of textile dye effluents by single and mixed bacterial culture can be found in the 
literature (Banat et al., 1996; Delee et al., 1998; Stolz. 2001; Pearce et al.. 2003. 
Pearce, 2004). 
Anaerobic azo dye reduction has been studied intensively. It is now well documented 
that it is a non-specific, microbially mediated process. Under anaerobic (highly 
reductive) conditions, azo-reactive dyes undergo fission, yielding colourless aromatic 
amines, compounds that are generally biodegradable using aerobic biological 
methods (Georgiou et al., 2005). Moreover, the process involved is an enzymatic 
reaction, which requires reducing agents (e. g. riboflavin), acting as electron shuttles 
between the dyes and cellular-reducing enzymes (Georgiou and Aivasidis, 2006). 
The exact mechanism of such azo dye reduction, whether occurring intracellularly or 
extracellularly, is still a subject of investigation. Intracellular azo dye reduction 
cannot be responsible for the conversion of all types of azo dyes, especially for 
sulphonated azo dyes that have limited membrane permeability. The current 
hypothesis is that azo dye reduction mostly occurs by extracellular or 
membrane-bond enzyme interaction/involvement (Stolz, 2001; dos Santos et al., 
2007). 
Anaerobic-aerobic sequencing processes 
Fhe anaerobic reduction of azo dyes is generally a more efficient process than is 
aerobic degradation. The intermediate products, aromatic amines, produced by the 
reduction process are colourless. However, they are very resistant to further 
degradation under anaerobic conditions. The amines produced by the reduction of the 
azo dyes are much less toxic to the methanogens than are their parent compounds, 
but are still potentially carcinogenic (Forgacs et al., 2004). Under aerobic conditions, 
the mineralisation of these amines can be accomplished. Complete decoloration can, 
thus, be obtained by a sequenced anaerobic/aerobic treatment (Delee et al.. 1998). A 
sequential anaerobic packed column reactor and an activated sludge unit have been 
11 applied continuously for treatment of a textile wastewater. Over 85% decoloration 
and about 99% of COD removal efficiencies have been obtained (Kapdan and 
Alparslan, 2005). A sequential anoxic-aerobic bioreactor was designed for the 
decoloration and degradation of C. I. Acid Red 88, a sulphonated, azo group- 
containing textile dye that is commonly used in the textile dye industries (Khehra et 
al., 2006). The aromatic metabolic intermediates that were produced under anaerobic 
conditions have been transformed to non-aromatic metabolites during aerobic 
treatment. 98% of colour removal and 95% COD removal have been achieved. This 
two-stage biological treatment has been carried out in the colour removal of C. I. 
Reactive Black B in synthetic wastewaters (Libra et al. 2004; Mohanty et al. 2006). 
It was confirmed that the dye molecules were reduced and that aromatic amines were 
generated under anaerobic conditions. The aromatic amine metabolite was partly 
removed in subsequent aerobic treatment. 
1.4.3 Metabolic diversity of Shewanella species 
Members of the genus Shewanella have been studied extensively since 1931 with 
regard to a variety of topics of relevance to both applied and environmental 
microbiology (Venkateswaran et al., 1999). A notable feature of members of this 
genus is their ability to use a variety of different electron acceptors such as 
manganese oxide minerals and iron oxides, uranium ions, thiosulphate ions and 
elemental sulphur (Pearce, 2004). Most of the recognised species of the genus have 
the potential to mediate the co-metabolic bioremediation of halogenated organic 
pollutants and to reduce heavy metal ions (Xu et al., 2005). Shewanella putrefaciens 
was one of the earlier recognised microorganisms that enzymatically reduced U(VI) 
(Abdelouas et al., 1998). This microorganism uses U(VI) as the sole electron 
acceptor. It has been demonstrated that in both aerobic and anaerobic cultures. 
Slew 'anella oneidensis cells are capable of reducing chromate ions in aqueous 
solutions (Neal t't al., 200? ). Sheii'anella oncidensis MR-1 is a facultative, 
56 gram-negative non-fermenting y-proteobacterium whose respiratory versatility 
involves its ability to reduce a variety of compounds. including iron(III), manganese 
(IV), nitrate ions, thiosulphate ions, sulphite ions, trimethylamine N-oxide, dimethyl 
sulphoxide, fumarate ions, uranium(VI) ions, technetium (VII) ions, chromium (VI) 
ions, elemental sulphur and carbon tetrachloride (Bencheikh-Latmani et al.. 2005). 
Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 may be useful for the in-situ immobilisation of uranium 
ions and chromium ions in sub-surface environments because of its ability to reduce 
toxic and soluble hexavalent uranyl ions (U022+) and chromate ions (Cr042-) to less 
soluble and less toxic forms [U(IV) mineral and Cr(III) mineral]. Shewanella 
decolorationis S12, from the activated sludge of a textile-printing wastewater 
treatment plant, can decolorise the anthraquinone dye, Reactive Brilliant Blue K-GR. 
with flocculation first (Xu et al., 2006). Pearce (2004) has reviewed the reduction of 
a range of electron acceptors by various Shewanella strains that had been reported in 
the literature. Table 1.4.4 gives the research that has been done, on this theme, in 
recent years.

1.4.3.1 Shewanella strain J18 143 
Coloured wastewater from dye works is a problem in all industrialised countries. It is 
not surprising, therefore, that scientists work worldwide on dyework wastewater 
remediation. As discussed in previous sections, the decoloration of azo dye effluents 
is a more difficult task than that of the decoloration of several other dye types. Azo 
dye decolorising Shewanella cells were isolated from dyework wastewaters by 
Willimott and Guthrie in Leeds (UK, 1997), von Canstein et al. in Kyoto (Japan, 
2002) and Xu et al. in Guangzhou (China, 2005), or from river water by Kishimoto et 
al. (Japan, 2002) in Mara (Group meeting minutes). These Shewanella strains were 
all distinct from each other, suggesting that the decoloration of azo dyes, i. e. the 
reduction of the xenobiotic azo bond, is a common feature of the genus Shewanella 
and is most likely based on the same mechanism. 
59 Shewanella strain J18 143 is a gram-negative, facultative anaerobic bacterium that 
was isolated from an industrial textile effluent (Willmott, 1997). The bacterium 
shows an ability to decolorise selected reactive dyes on a solid medium, under 
aerobic conditions. The presence of a supplemental carbon source is essential to 
sustaining bacterial growth and to obtaining an acceptable level of decoloration. 
Decoloration of synthetic textile effluents, containing a commercial Remazol Black 
B dye has been achieved under anaerobic conditions by Willmott (1997), using free 
cells and immobilised cells of Shewanella strain J18 143. These studies were 
continued further by Kamilaki (2000) and by Pearce (2004). Shewanella strain J 18 
143 cells are also capable of using the azo/ketohydrazone chromophores in solid 
coloured species, such as pigment dispersions and dyed cotton fibres and fabrics, as 
electron acceptors for anaerobic respiration (Pearce, 2004; Pearce et al., 2006). 
1.5 Immobilisation of microbial cells and applications in 
the decoloration of textile wastewaters 
An early industrial application of immobilised microbial cells was realised in 1969 in 
the continuous production of L-aspartic acid (Chibata and Tosa, 1983). Since then, 
immobilised microorganisms have been the subject of increased interest, and have 
been developed rapidly for application in wastewater treatments (Kudlich et al., 
1996). 
Immobilised cells have offered several advantages over the free cells in industrial 
and analytical applications (Chibata and Tosa, 1983; Gil, 1983). The stability of 
immobilised cells can be improved, relative to the stability of the non-immobilised 
equivalents. A better control of reaction is achievable. The immobilised cells can be 
easily removed from the reaction system and, under appropriate conditions, can be 
used repeatedly and flexibly to make the continuous processes practical. Less space 
is required for reaction using immobilised cells and a high cell concentration can be 
introduced in the system. In this way. expensive enzymes can be used economicalk- 
60 for industrial applications. Furthermore, the immobilisation supports can provide a 
protective environment for the cells against denaturants, proteolysis and reduced 
susceptibility to contamination, so that the cells are less affected by any fluctuations 
in the characteristics of their surroundings (Kamilaki, 2000: Kulshrestha and Husain, 
2006). 
1.5.1 Methods for immobilisation of microbial cells and enzymes 
Methods for immobilising microbial cells and enzymes have been reported in a 
number of texts (Chibata and Tosa, 1977, Gil, 1983: Klein and Wagner, 19833, 
Willmott, 1997). 
Adsorption of microbial cells and enzymes on insoluble supports is one of the more 
inexpensive and simple immobilisation techniques available (Khan et al., 2006). The 
immobilisation can be achieved by mixing an aqueous solution/dispersion of an 
enzyme, or a cell suspension with a support material for a given period of time, after 
which the excess biological species is washed away (Wilimott, 1997). The adsorption 
of microbial species can be carried out in two ways, by physical adsorption onto the 
carrier or by ionic binding to the support (Gil, 1983). This method may be 
disadvantaged by the leakage of enzymes from cells owing to autolysis of cells 
during continuous enzyme reaction (Chibata and Tosa, 1977). Another disadvantage 
is the fact that diffusion problems may occur. 
Entrapment and encapsulation of microbial cells or of enzymes have also been used 
in physical immobilisations. Entrapment may be achieved by entrapping the 
microbial cells or enzymes into a polymer matrix where they are physically 
restrained (Chibata and Tosa, 1977). This method involves the formation of a highly 
cross-linked network-polymer. The drawback of entrapment is that such systems may 
easily suffer from problems of diffusion. The entrapment of microorganisms can be 
achieved by entrapping microoganisms in gels, such as agar gels and alginate gels 
(Chen and Cheng. 1996: Lu et al., 1996: Chen and Liu 2007). In the method of 
61 encapsulation, the microbial cells or the enzymes are immobilised in microcapsules 
that have either permanent or non-permanent semipermeable membrane character 
(Gil, 1983). 
Chemical methods involve the formation of covalent bonds between the support and 
the biological species (cells, enzymes). For chemical methods, cells can be 
immobilised by reaction with a reactive polymer without pre-activation, by activation 
of a polymeric support by conversion of a functional group of the polymer and by 
activation of the polymer using selected coupling agents. However, covalent 
immobilisation of enzymes often resulted in the loss of activity (Khan and Husain, 
2007). 
More detailed information relating to the techniques of immobilisation of microbial 
cells and enzymes is given in many texts (Chibata and Tosa, 1977; Gil, 1983; Klein 
and Wagner, 1983; Willmott, 1977). 
1.5.2 Applications of immobilised microbial cells and enzymes in the 
decoloration of textile wastewaters 
Oxspring et al. (1996) have studied the decoloration of Remazol Black B solutions 
by an immobilised microbial consortium. In one system, the decoloration of the dye 
solutions by gravel-substratum immobilised cells was built with an upflow anaerobic 
filter. The ability of the microbial consortium to decolorise the selected dye was 
enhanced by the developed immobilisation system. 
Juang et al. (2002) have studied the immobilisation of enzymes onto glutaraldehyde- 
cross-linked chitosan beads via the method of physical adsorption. The process was 
carried out by keeping the cross-linked chitosan beads contacted with the enzymes, 
in a shaker, for 18 hours at 4°C. The activity and the stability of the immobilised 
enzymes or biological cells were affected by the immobilisation substrates. 
Therefore, the utilisation of the immobilisation support or the modification of the 
62 chosen substrate is an important factor in the applications of the immobilised 
biological species. 
Peralta-Zamora et al. (2003) and Dominguez et al. (2005) have immobilised laccase. 
which was produced by Trametes versicolor. The immobilised laccase was used in 
the decoloration of aqueous solutions of selected textile dyes. Chemically modified 
silica, with imidazole groups, and alginate beads were efficient adsorption supports 
in the studies. However, in most cases, the enzymatic decoloration was masked by a 
simple adsorption process of the dyes onto the support surface. Thus, colour removal 
was not totally by biological degradation. 
Khan and Husain (2007) have studied the decoloration and removal of selected 
reactive textile dyes from polluted wastewaters and dyeing effluents using a system 
of celite-bound, potato polyphenol oxidase. The immobilised potato polyphenol 
oxidase was found significantly to be more effective in decolorising the individual 
dye solutions of complex mixtures of dyes than was the equivalent soluble enzyme. 
Lu et al. (2007) have also applied immobilised laccase in dye decoloration studies. 
The ligninolytic enzymes of laccase were immobilised by entrapment in 
alginate-chitosan microcapsules. The immobilised laccase was less active and had a 
lower substrate affinity than did the free enzyme. However, the stability and the 
reusability of the enzymes were enhanced compared with the performance of the free 
enzyme equivalents. 
Pseudomonas luteola cells have been immobilised by entrapment in alginate-silicate 
sol-gel beads for the decoloration of the azo dye, C. I. Reactive Red 22 (Chen and 
Lin, 2007). The immobilised cells gave a lower specific decoloration rate than did 
the free cells. The advantages of the immobilised cells were that the cells became 
less sensitive to changes in pH values and were more stable during repeated use. 
Also, they showed better thermal stability during storage and operation than did the 
tree cells. 
63 1.5.3 The options of support materials for immobilising microbial 
cells and enzymes in the decoloration of textile wastewaters 
Various materials have been explored and investigated for their suitability for use as 
cell immobilisation substrates. The support materials need to meet the following 
criteria: non-biodegradability, high mechanical stability, high diffusivity, simple 
immobilisation procedure, high biomass retention, minimal attachment of other 
organisms and, preferably, a low cost price (Leenen, 1996). 
The use of a cheaper source of enzyme and support will definitely minimise the cost 
of immobilisation of the enzyme. There is a need to provide a suitable system for the 
treatment of large volume of wastewater in batch processes as well as in continuous 
reactors. Microbial cells that have been immobilised on natural polymers (alginates, 
carrageenan, chitosan or cellulose derivatives) have found more applications during 
continuous operation in different processes. 
Several studies have employed different materials for the attachment procedures. 
These materials include polyurethane foams (Mielgo et al., 2002), textile strips and 
straw (Kaluskar et al., 1999), nylon cubes, polystryrene foams and stainless steel 
sponges (Rodriguez-Couto et al., 2004). Some studies have been conducted with 
cells that have been immobilised on sodium alginate or calcium alginate. Calcium 
alginate, as an immobilisation substrate for the biological cells, offers some 
advantages. These include biodegradability, hydrophilicity, presence of functional 
carboxylic groups, natural origin, low density, mechanical stability and stability over 
an experimental pH range of 3.0-8.0 (Dominguez et al., 2005). Chitosan has been 
used as a support material for enzyme immobilisation because of its many suitable 
characteristics such as hydrophilicity. biocompatibility, biodegradability and 
anti-bacterial properties. It appears to be economically attractive since chitin is the 
second most abundant biopolymer in nature, after cellulose. Highly swollen chitosan 
beads, prepared from cuttlefish wastes, have been cross-linked with glutaraldehyde 
or glyoxal. Enzymes have been immobilised onto these glutaraldehvde-cross-linked 
64 chitosan beads (Juang et al.. 2002). An attempt at the direct immobilisation of 
polyphenol oxidase on an adsorbent, Celite 545, has also been made (Khan et al. , 
2006). 
Cellulose and cellulose derivatives have been used in many applications as a support 
in microbial cell immobilisation studies. Many workers have chosen cellulose or 
cellulose derivatives as a support because they are inexpensive, have good physical 
shape, are chemically stable, and are resistant to microbiological contamination 
(Chen and Tsao, 1977). Also, cellulose has three hydroxyl groups on each 
anhydro-glucose unit providing high versatility as well as a large capacity for the 
immobilisation of a desired substance. 
Willmott (1997) has regenerated cellulose beads as an immobilisation support for the 
bacterial cells of Shewanella strain J18 143 and had applied this system to the 
removal of colour from reactive dye effluents. Sawayama et al. (1998) have used 
cellulose beads for immobilising bacterial cells of Rhodobacter capsulatus in water 
treatment applications. The use of the cellulose beads as the immobilisation support 
has been applied due to the inherent high porosity of the beads and also their 
improved mechanical strength. Direct immobilisation of peroxidases on activated 
diethylaminoethyl cellulose from ammonium sulphate-fractionated proteins of bitter 
gourd has been investigated (Kulshrestha and Husain, 2006). 
The application of chemically modified cellulose in the immobilisation of microbial 
cells and of enzymes is very effective. The modified cellulose possesses advantages 
of cellulose or cellulose beads. Furthermore, the modified cellulose can provide a 
higher capacity for forming a large number of bonds. Also, surface adsorption can be 
readily achieved. Gil (1983) has studied the immobilisation of the proteins, enzymes 
and cells onto graft copolymeric substrates, since systems containing hydroxyl 
groups are good as supports for the immobilisation of biocataly'sts. Grafting 
copolymerisation is a very convenient way of modiflying the surface properties of 
polymers. Graft copolymerisation onto cellulose can be achieved in several ways 
based on radiation treatment and on chemical reaction routes. Grafting via chemical 
65 reaction has offered a major approach to the creation of active groups on the 
cellulose copolymer or derivatives. The grafting of monomers or mixture of 
monomers can greatly increase the number of reactive groups that can be used for 
cell immobilisation. The extent of incorporation of hydrophilic groups or of 
hydrophobic groups can be controlled, creating a micro environment that could 
improve the viability and stability of the biological materials that have been 
immobilised. 
66 2 Materials and Methods 
In this chapter, the experimental procedures of the decoloration of coloured textile 
wastewaters using Shewanella strain J 18 143 are described. 
Section 2.1 describes the materials and the methods that were used for the 
preparation of the immobilisation substrate, that involved for the preparation of the 
bacterial cells of Shewanella strain J18 143 and that used for the immobilisation of 
the bacterial cells. A graft cellulose copolymer was prepared as the substrate for 
immobilisation. The prepared bacterial cells, in a cell suspension, were immobilised 
onto the substrate by three methods namely "growing-in", coupling and adsorption. 
Section 2.2 gives the materials and the methods used for the decoloration of Remazol 
Black B dye solutions using the immobilised cells. Several standards were 
established for a comparison of the decoloration effect. 
Studies relating to the colour reduction of metal-complex azo dyes, using free resting 
cells of Shewanella strain J18 143, are given in Section 2.3. Four Irgalan series of 
metal-complex azo dyes were chosen. These are commercially named Irgalan Grey 
GLN, Irgalan Black RBLN, Irgalan Blue 3GL and Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWL. 
Factors such as the dye concentration, the temperature and the pH, which might have 
influence on the colour reduction of the metal-complex azo dyes, are concentrated in 
Section 2.4. 
Several analytical techniques, gravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy. 
UV-visible spectrophotometry, particle size analysis and protein assay. were used as 
described in Section 2.5. These methods were employed to investigate the 
modification of the cellulose, the cell preparations, the colour reduction of the 
coloured compounds and the cell concentrations used in the decoloration systems. 
67 2.1 Materials and methods for the preparation of the 
immobilisation substrate and for the immobilisation of 
biological cells 
All of the chemicals used were of analytical grade, obtained from Sigma-Aldrich 
Gillingham (Dorset, UK), unless otherwise stated. 
2.1.1 Materials and methods for the preparation of the cellulosic 
copolymer-based immobilisation substrate 
Modified cellulose (a grafted cellulose copolymer) was chosen as immobilisation 
substrate. This section covers the preparation and the characterisation studies of the 
cellulosic graft copolymer. 
2.1.1.1 Materials used in preparation of the cellulosic graft copolymer 
The cellulose-g. co-monomer system was chosen as the immobilisation substrate for 
biological cells in the decoloration systems involving immobilised cells. The 
cellulose used was in the form of bleached cotton fabric, and was supplied by 
Whaleys (Bradford) Ltd. (Bradford, UK). The cellulose was cut into strips (20 cm 
30 cm). The strips were washed with detergent and then water before being dried at 
60 °C, thoroughly. All of the dried strips were kept in desiccator before use. 
Potassium persulphate was chosen as the initiator. The monomer grafted onto the 
cellulose was methacrylic acid. The methacrylic acid was purified by passage 
through an aluminium oxide column before use. Removal of inhibitor was ensured 
by spectrophotometric analysis of the eluent monomer. 
2.1.1.2 Grafting copoh merisation 
The pre-washed cellulose strips were cut into smaller pieces. about 2 cm x5 cm. 
68 Initial swelling of the cellulose was achieved by stirring the cotton fabric slivers at 
28 °C in distilled water for 2 hours, followed by soaking in the system overnight. 
The graft copolymerisation treatment of the swollen cotton fabrics was carried out in 
500 cm3 round-bottomed reaction vessels. 
The swollen cotton fabrics were stirred gently for 60 minutes in an aqueous solution 
containing an appropriate amount of the initiator (0.075 mol dm-3), potassium 
persulphate, at 28 T. After one hour of impregnating of the pre-treated fabrics, the 
purified monomer, methacrylic acid (0.5 mol dm-3), was added into the reaction 
system, dropwise. The treatment was allowed to proceed at 60 °C in a water bath. 
with the use of thermostirrer and condenser, for 5 hours. At the end of the desired 
reaction period, the fabrics were washed thoroughly with distilled water in Soxhlet 
extractor for 6 hours, to dissolve any produced extractable homopolymer. Afterwards, 
the grafted fabric was washed with distilled water again, and dried at 35 °C in the 
oven until a constant weight was achieved. The process is shown in Figure 2.1.1.

expressed below.

A series of tests was set up to control the grafting yield. This was carried out by 
optimising the amount of the monomer and of the initiator. The concentration of the 
monomer used was 0.25 mol dm-3 while a series of solutions of the initiator was 
prepared, with a final concentration in the reaction system at 0.025 mol dm-3.0.05 
mol dm-3,0.06 mol dm-3,0.075 mol dm-3,0.10 mol dm-3 and 0.15 mol dm-3. The 
same procedures were repeated with the final concentration of the monomer in the 
reaction system at 0.50 mol dm-3,0.75 mol dm-3 and 0.10 mol dm-3. 
To determine the amount of -COOH groups that were available for subsequent 
immobilisation reactions, the method of titrimetric analysis was employed. The 
titration began with the preparation of a standard solution of potassium hydrogen 
phthalate (0.1 mol dm-3) and a solution of sodium hydroxide (0.1 mol dm-3). The 
prepared solution of sodium hydroxide was titrated using phenolphthalein as 
indicator. In analysing the copolymer, a known amount of grafted cellulose (by 
weight) was immersed into certain known amount of NaOH solution and was left for 
18 hours. 20 cm-3 of NaOH solution was then extracted from the solution containing 
the immersed cellulosic graft copolymer and was titrated with the standard potassium 
hydrogen phthalate solution (0.1 mol dm-3). The concentration of the NaOH solution 
before and after the immersion of the grafted cellulose was then determined. The 
concentration of the -COOH existed on the grafted cellulose then can be calculated. 
2.1.2 Materials and methods for the preparation of biological cells - 
Shewanella strain J18 143 
The bacterial strain, Sheii'wiella J 18 143, is a facultative anaerobic bacterium. It was 
originally isolated from soil that had been contaminated with textile «astewater 
(W'illmott, 1997). 
70 2.1.2.1 Preparation of growth medium 
The bacteria were grown in a tryptone soy broth (T. S. B. ) medium. The T. S. B. 
powder was obtained from Lab M (International Diagnostics Group plc, Bury, UK). 
The composition of tryptone soy broth powder is shown in Table 2.1.1. To prepare a 
sterile culture medium, the 30 g dm-3 tryptone soy broth solution was made up with 
distilled water and was autoclaved using a pressure cooker (Section 2.1.2.4) obtained 
from Breville (Oldham, UK), for 15 minutes at 121 °C.

2.1.2.2 Streak-plate technique 
Two types of agar plates were used in the experiments. One type was the tryptone 
soy agar plate that was used for short-term storage of bacterial culture and for 
purification checks of the bacterial cultures. Another type was the dye-agar-broth 
plate that was used for the evaluation of decoloration ability of the biological cells on 
the contained dye. 
The tryptone soy agar (T. S. A. ) that was used was obtained from Lab %1 
(International Diagnostics Group plc, Bury, UK). The components of the agar 
powder are shown in Table 2.1.1 as above. 
71 To prepare an agar plate, tryptone soy agar powder was stirred and heated in distilled 
water in an Erlenmeyer conical flask (Fisher Scientific, Manchester, UK) to the boil. 
to make up a 37 g dm "3 solution. The solution was then transferred immediately from 
the conical flask to a Duran bottle which was obtained from Adelphi [Adelphi (Tubes) 
Ltd., Haywards Heath, UK]. It was then autoclaved in the pressure cooker for 15 
minutes at 121 °C. The sterilised agar was cooled to 50°C before pouring into a Petri 
dish (Fisher Scientific, Manchester, UK). The Petri dishes used were triple-vented. 
20 cm3 of agar was poured, just enough to cover the bottom of the dish. The dish was 
left inverted to dry over weekend, after which time the agar was solidified. Prepared 
plates were sealed with parafilm, supplied by Alcan packaging (Neenah, Wisconsin, 
USA). The prepared plates were pre-incubated before use to check for any 
contaminants. The incubator used was a Binder general purpose incubator obtained 
from Phillip Harris Scientific Ltd. (Hull, UK). 
The dye-agar-broth plates were prepared by dissolving the target dye powder in the 
agar solution before sterilisation. The same procedures were followed as that used in 
preparing the agar plates. 
To streak a plate, a platinum transfer loop was sterilised by flaming until it glowed 
red. It was then cooled by stabbing it into sterile agar medium from the plate. The 
cooled loop was used to pick up bacteria for streaking. A single, well-isolated 
bacterial colony, grown on the surface of solid medium was touched by the loop, or 
the bacterial culture was picked up by dipping the loop into growing bacterial starter 
culture (Section 2.1.2.5). The bacteria adhering to the loop were streaked onto a 
segment of a plate that contained the agar medium. The loop was sterilised by 
flaming and cooled by stabbing into a region of the agar medium that was free of 
bacterial cells. The loop was passed once across one end of the primary streak and 
the bacteria that adhered to the loop were spread into a fresh region of the agar 
medium. The loop was sterilised and cooled again and was streaked from one end of 
the secondary streak. This process was repeated triply or more, serially. Again, the 
loop was sterilised and cooled and streaked from one end of the secondary streak to 
72 spread a third direction on the plate. and repeated triply or more. The lid was 
replaced on the plate and the plate was sealed. The bottom of the plate was labelled 
and the plate incubated in an inverted position at the appropriate temperature (usually 
30 °C) for 16-24 hours. 
2.1.2.3 Culture storage 
The bacterial cultures were stored in three types of storage arrangements, short-term 
storage on agar plates, medium-term storage on agar slopes and long-term storage 
involving cryogenic freezing. 
Colonies of the strains of bacteria could be maintained up to a period of a week on 
the surface of agar media of the plates (Section 2.1.2.2) that were tightly wrapped in 
parafilm and stored inverted in incubator at 30°C. 
The bacterial strains stock was also stored in agar slopes that were normally kept in a 
refrigerator for one month. The agar slopes were prepared in screw-capped, universal 
bottles [25 cm3, obtained from Adelphi (Tubes) Ltd., Haywards Heath, UK] 
containing 10 cm3 of tryptone soy agar medium (37 g dm-3). The bottles that 
contained boiled agar solution were sterilised at 121 °C for 15 minutes and then left to 
dry at an angle of 45° overnight, with the caps loosely opened. The prepared agar 
slopes were wrapped tightly in parafilm to prevent desiccation and contamination of 
the medium. 
To prepare the medium-term storage bacterial stock, 0.3 cm3 of starter culture 
(Section 2.1.2.5) were streak-spread onto the surface of the agar slope. The slope was 
left in the incubator (Economy Incubator with fan model QCD 35, ) at 35°C with the 
cap loosely opened for 24 hours. The prepared stock was wrapped tightly in parafilm 
and kept in a refrigerator. 
Sheivanc'lla strain J18 143 cultures were cryogenically frozen for long term storage. 
The long-term storage stock was prepared and stored at Manchester University 
(Department of Geomicrobiology. School of Earth, Atmospheric and Environmental 
73 Sciences, The University of Manchester UK). 0.9 cm3 of inoculum were added to 
2.0 cm3 of cryogenic vials (Coming Inc.. UK) together with 0.6 cm3 of sterile 
glycerol solution (50% in distilled water). The prepared vials were flash frozen xvith 
liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C (Pearce, 2004). 
2.1.2.4 Aseptic techniques 
Three types of aseptic technique were used in the experimental work, flaming. 
autoclaving and the use of chemicals. 
Rapid sterilisation for loops, bottles and flask necks was carried our by flaming the 
relevant sections with the use of Bunsen burner. The loop was flamed until it 
appeared red and kept for five seconds before and after it was used. The bottle and 
flask necks were flamed before each opening and each closing. 
A Commander SES benchtop steriliser (Eschmann Equipment, West Sussex, UK) 
and a Breville electric express pressure cooker (Oldham, UK) were used for 
autoclaving procedures. 
All of the pipette tips, bottles and microtubes etc., were autoclaved using the 
Commander SES steriliser. The steriliser was used for unwrapped instruments and 
utensils according to manufacturer instructions. In use, all of the media, bacterial 
cultures, and glassware were autoclaved using the pressure cooker. This pressure 
cooker was also used to sterilise liquids. 
Aqueous ethanol (75% w/w), was used for sterilising the apparatus and the work 
bench. 
Hands were washed with anti-microbial hand soap supplied by Day-Impex Ltd 
(Essex, UK) and all of the apparatus used was washed with Hibitane concentrate 5% 
(Astra Zeneca UK Ltd, Hertfordshire, UK). 
74 2.1.2.5 Preparation of planktonic Shewanella strain J18 143 cells 
To prepare free cells of Shewanella strain J18 143,50 cm3 of the prepared bacterial 
growth medium (Section 2.1.2.1) were measured in 250 cm3 Erlenmever conical 
flasks. The flasks were sealed with foam bungs (38 mm x 50 mm. Fisher Scientific. 
Manchester, UK) and covered with foil. The flasks were autoclaved in the pressure 
cooker for 15 minutes at 121 T. A loop of inoculum, from the culture stock. 
Shewanella strain J 18 143, was put into the cooled sterile growth medium. The flasks 
were then left overnight in a water-shaker bath (Grant Instruments Ltd, Cambridge, 
UK), incubated at 30 °C with shaking at 200 rpm overnight. 
The following day, the aerobica starter culture of Shewanella strain J 18 143 was 
suitable for use in experimentation. 
To prepare the anaerobically grown Shewanella strain J18 143 cells, 100 cm3 
universal bottles, containing 90 cm3 of the prepared growth medium, loosely covered 
with butyl rubber stoppers (20 mm), were sterilised in a pressure cooker for 15 
minutes at 121 °C. The universal bottles and the butyl rubber stoppers were obtained 
from Adelphi (Tubes) Ltd. (West Sussex, UK). The bottles were sealed immediately 
out of the pressure cooker. The bottles then were cooled to room temperature and 
inoculated with 9 cm3 of the prepared starter culture. The anaerobic growth cultures 
were incubated in a Binder general purpose incubator obtained from Phillip Harris 
Scientific Ltd. (Hull, UK). To obtain sufficient anaerobic cell growth, the bottles 
were incubated for 4 hours at 35 °C. 
The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes, using a Jouan 
Centrifuge C3-12 (Jouan Ltd., UK) and washed twice in phosphate buffer saline 
(P. B. S., 10 mM, pH 7) medium solution (see Section 2.2.1). The cells supernatant in 
P. B. S was prepared to make the cell suspension. The cell suspension was diluted (10 
times) such that the diluted suspension gave an absorbance of 0.5 at 600 nm, to 
ensure that the absorbance of the monitored reduction reactions was maintained 
below I-1.5, using a Specord SIOO UV-Visible spectrophotometer (Spectronic 
75 Analytical Instruments, Leeds, UK). This prepared cell suspension was used 
immediately. 
2.1.3 Immobilisation of Shewanella strain J18 143 cells 
Three immobilisation methods were used in the study (Figure 2.1.2), the 
"growing-in" method, the physical adsorption method and the chemical coupling 
method. The immobilisation method of "growing-in" was aimed at growing the 
biological cells within the texture of the cellulose copolymeric substrate for 
immobilisation. The method of adsorption was aimed at allowing the biological cells 
to be adsorbed onto the immobilisation substrate physically. The biological cells 
were also immobilised by chemical coupling. Thus, a chemical coupling agent was 
used to couple the cells onto the cellulose copolymer substrate (Gil, 1983). The 
coupling agent used was CMC, 1-cyclohexyl-3-[2-morphilinyl-4-ethyl]carbodi- 
imide metho-p-toluene sulphonate (Sigma-Aldrich Co Ltd., Dorset, UK). 
The immobilisation methods are summarised in Figure 2.1.2.

76 2.1.3.1 Immobilisation of biological cells onto the substrate using the method of 
"growing-in" 
To start the process of cell immobilisation using the method of "growing-in". a 
known amount (approximately I g) of grafted cellulose was put into 50 cm3 of the 
prepared tryptone soy broth growth medium (30 g dm-3) in 250 cm3 conical flasks. 
The flasks were covered with foam bungs and aluminium foil and were autoclaved 
for 15 minutes at 121 °C. A loop of inoculum was put into the cooled flasks. The 
flasks were sealed and were left overnight in the water shaker bath, incubated at 30 
°C, with shaking at 200 rpm. 
The grafted cellulose samples were then removed from the flasks and washed 
thoroughly in phosphate buffer saline solution (P. B. S., 10 mM, pH 7, Section ?.?. 1). 
These grafted cellulose samples, together with the immobilised cells, were prepared 
after washing, for the decoloration experiments. 
2.1.3.2 Immobilisation of biological cells onto substrates using the method of 
physical adsorption 
The same amount of grafted cellulose as that mentioned in Section 2.1.3.1, was put 
into conical flasks (250 cm3) that contained 50 cm3 of P. B. S. (10 mM, pH 7, Section 
2.2.1). The flasks were sterilised using a pressure cooker. The sterilised grafted 
cellulose was removed into 10 cm3 vials, containing the prepared cell suspension 
(Section 2.1.2.5) and P. B. S. solution (10 mM, pH 7). The vials were kept in a 
refrigerator for 18 hours. The grafted cellulose was washed using the P. B. S. solution 
(10 mM, pH 7) and was ready for use. 
2.1.3.3 Immobilisation of biological cells onto the substrate using the method of 
chemical coupling 
The same amount of grafted cellulose, as that mentioned in Section 2.1.3.1. was put 
into conical flasks (250 cm') that contained 50 cm3 of P. B. S. (10 mM. pH 7, Section 
77 2.2.1). The flasks were sterilised at 121 °C for 15 minutes. The sterilised grafted 
cellulose was removed into conical flasks (100 cm3) containing 30 cm3 of NaHCO; 
(0.1 M), 0.15 g of carbodiimide (1-cyclohexyl-3-[2-morphilinv, l-4-ethvvl]carbodi- 
imide metho-p-toluene sulphonate, CMC) and 2.0 cm3of the prepared cell suspension 
(Section 2.1.2.5). The flask was left in the water bath at 4 °C. and shaken for 4 hours. 
Then the flask was refrigerated for 18 hours. The grafted cellulose, with the coupled 
cells, was taken out from the flask, after coupling, and washed with P. B. S. solution 
(10 mM, pH 7). 
2.1.4 Protein assay of immobilised biological cells 
Protein assays of immobilised cells were employed. The protein assay method used 
by Ramachandran (2004) was followed. Unfortunately, the procedure was not 
suitable for this work. Protein analysis based on the method for the planktonic resting 
cells, as used by Pearce (2004), was suggested (von Canstein, 2005, personal 
communication). The method is given in detail in Section 2.5.5.2. 
2.2 Decoloration of Remazol Black B dye solution using 
immobilised Shewanella strain J18 143 cells 
Decoloration of Remazol Black B dye solution using immobilised bacterial cells was 
studied. The bacterial cells used were immobilised onto the cellulosic graft 
copolymer by the three methods described in Section 2.1.3. 
2.2.1 Materials 
The Remazol Black B dye used was obtained from Dystar UK Ltd. (Huddersfield, 
UK). Pearce (2004) previously compared a commercially synthesised dye sample 
with a laboratory synthesised dye sample of the Remazol Black B. The conclusion 
78 was that the commercial Remazol Black B dye had a greater purity than the 
laboratory synthesised dye. Furthermore, the additives that were presented in the 
commercial dye increased the colour intensity of the dye. The selection of the d`-e 
solution was based on the wish that it should present a "real" textile effluent for the 
colour removal treatment study. Therefore, it was decided that the commercial dye 
would be used for all of the subsequent experiments. 
All of the decoloration experiments based on Remazol Black B dye solutions \N-ere 
carried out in the phosphate buffer saline (P. B. S.. 10 mM, pH 7) solution. The P. B. S. 
solution was prepared by mixing 4g of sodium chloride, 30.5 cm3 of potassium 
monohydrogen phosphate (K2HPO4,0.1 M) and 19.5 cm3 of potassium dihydrogen 
phosphate (KH2PO4,0.1 M) and diluting to 500 cm3 with distilled water. 
Addition of an organic acid electron donor increases the rate of dye reduction and 
gives an indication of the enzyme pathway that is responsible for the reduction 
reaction (Pearce, 2004). Sodium formate was chosen and was used in all of the 
subsequent decoloration experiments after comparing its efficiency with that of other 
possible electron donors (Pearce, 2004). The addition of an exogenous extracellular 
electron shuttle can accelerate the reaction rate of the dye decoloration. 
Anthraquinone-2,6-disulphonic acid (AQDS, 0.01 M) was used as the electron shuttle 
in the decoloration systems. 
All of the decoloration experiments were carried out in autosampler vials (size 10 
cm3, cap 23 x 46 mm) obtained from Kimble Glass Inc. (Vineland, New Jersey, 
USA), sealed with 20 mm gold/alumina top seals with PTFE-faced, butyl rubber 
liners, obtained from Alltech Associates/Applied Sciences (Carnforth, Lancashire, 
UK). 
2.2.2 Calibration curve of Remazol Black B dye solutions 
A calibration curve of absorbance versus dye concentration of the Remazol Black B 
solution was constructed.: series of Remazol Black B solutions, with concentrations 
79 ranging from 10 mg dm -3 to 60 mg dm"3, were prepared in volumetric flasks. The 
absorbance of the dye solutions was measured at 597 nm using a Specord S 100 
UV-Visible spectrophotometer (Spectronic Analytical Instruments, Leeds, UK). The 
absorbance, measured at the same wavelength for the same dye solution, i. e. with the 
same absorption coefficient, is proportional to the concentration of the absorbing 
medium. The calibration is affected by means of linear regression. The calibration 
curve was used to calculate the amount of Remazol Black B that had been reduced in 
each experiment. The UV-visible spectroscopy analysis method, used in preparation 
of calibration curves, is given in Section 2.5.3. 
2.2.3 Establishment of standards 
The decoloration system was designed to remove the colour from Remazol Black B 
dye solutions, using immobilised Shewanella strain J18 143 cells with the addition of 
sodium formate solution and anthraquinone-2,6-disulphonic acid (AQDS) solution. 
To have an appreciation of the colour removal that has been brought by the 
immobilised cells, as prepared in Section 2.1.3, standards needed to be prepared, for 
comparisons. All of the standards were prepared in 10 cm3 autosampler vials. The 
total volume of liquid in each of the decoloration systems was 9.5 cm3. The very 
small amounts of liquid that were transferred into the systems with the immobilised 
cells were negligible in their influence. The concentration of the sodium formate 
solution used was 1 M, and the final concentration in the system was 21 mM. The 
concentration of the AQDS solution used was 0.01 M, and the final concentration in 
the system was 100 µM. The concentration of the phosphate buffering saline solution 
used was 10 mM, pH 7. All of the prepared vials were sealed with gold/alumina top 
seals with PTFE-faced butyl rubber liners and the headspaces were filled with 
nitrogen. 
To have a better understanding of the colour removal effect of the immobilised 
biological cells on the targeted dye solutions. several standard controls were 
80 established as the immobilised cells standard, the dye solution standard, the cell 
growth medium solution standard, the grafted cellulose standard and the planktonic 
cells standard. All of the standards had been treated under the same conditions and 
same procedures as those for the colour removal samples. The standards were 
incubated at 30 °C, unless otherwise stated, without shaking, for 7 days. Absorbance 
readings were taken daily at 597 nm using a Specord S 100 UV-visible 
spectrophotometer. At the same time, photographic representations were taken using 
a digital camera (Nikon COOLPIX2500). Each experiment was carried out in 
triplicate. 
2.2.3.1 Immobilised cells standard 
A control of immobilised cells was established for evaluating the effect of the 
immobilised cells and that of the existing of the immobilisation substrate in the 
absorbance measurement. The absorbance of the prepared systems, without the 
addition of dye solution, was measured as one of the colour removal controls. The 
vials were prepared with sodium formate (21 mM), AQDS (100 µM), with prepared 
immobilised cells and P. B. S. solution. As mentioned in Section 2.1.3, the bacterial 
cells were immobilised by the three different methods. However, there was no need 
to establish the individual standard for each of the methods. The aim of establishing 
this control was to investigate the effect of the immobilised cells on the measurement 
of the adsorption of the analysed solution. 
2.2.3.2 Dye solution standard 
As the decoloration of the targeted dye solution occurred, the colour of the treated 
samples would be expected to change. As the durations of the treatment varied. a 
control of targeted dye solution without any addition of biological cells was needed 
throughout the process. 
The dye solution standards were prepared with dye solution (final concentration in 
the system was 50 µI\1), sodium formate (final concentration in the s` stem was ?1 
81 mM), AQDS (final concentration in the system 100 . AI) and P. B. S. solution (10 mM. 
pH 7) to make 9.5 cm3 in total volume. 
2.2.3.3 Cell growth medium solution standards 
The cell growth medium used was tryptone soy broth (Section 2.1.1.2). The effect of 
any cell growth medium that might incidentally be brought into the system from the 
immobilisation process was investigated. 
The vials prepared for these standards contained dye solution (final concentration in 
the system was 50 µM), sodium formate (final concentration in the system was 21 
mM), AQDS, (final concentration in the system was 100 µM), the "treated" graft 
cellulosic copolymer (the graft cellulosic copolymer underwent the procedures of 
immobilisation of the method of "growing-in" with the absence of bacterial cells) 
and a specified amount of P. B. S. solution (10 mM, pH7) to make the system 9.5 cm3 
in total volume. 
2.2.3.4 Graft cellulosic copolymer standard 
The effect of the immobilisation substrate, the cellulosic graft copolymer, was 
investigated. The vials prepared for the grafted cellulose standards were prepared 
with dye solution (final concentration in the system was 50 µM), sodium formate 
(final concentration in the system was 21 mM), AQDS (final concentration in the 
system was 100 µM), appropriate amounts of grafted cellulose and specified amounts 
of P. B. S. solution (10 mM, pH7) to make 9.5 cm3 of the system. 
2.2.3.5 Free cells standard 
The cffect of the planktonic Shewanella strain J 18 143 cells on the colour removal of 
Remazol Black B the solutions has been well investigated (Pearce. 2004). The same 
concentration of the biological cells was used in this control. The vials contained dye 
solution (final concentration in the system was 50 µi 1), sodium formate (final 
82 concentration in the system was 21 mM). AQDS (final concentration in the system 
was 100 µM), prepared cell suspension (0.5 cm3) and known amounts of P. B. S. 
solution (10 mM, pH 7) to make the final up to 9.5 cm3. 
2.2.4 Colour removal from Remazol Black B dye solutions using 
immobilised Shewanella strain J18 143 cells 
Remazol Black B dye was chosen as the model azo dye with respect to a typical dye 
existing in textile effluents, to evaluate the decoloration efficiency of the 
immobilised cells. All of the reduction investigations were carried out in 10 cm3 
autosampler vials. Each vial contained the Remazol Black B dye solution, sodium 
formate, anthraquinone-2,6-disulphonic acid disodium salt (AQDS), prepared cell 
suspension (0.5 cm3) and certain, known amounts of buffer saline solution to make 
up 9.5 cm3 in total volume, unless otherwise stated. 
The grafted cellulose samples, with the immobilised cells, for each of the 
immobilisation methods, were put into the vials at same weight, respectively. The 
concentration of the Remazol Black B dye solution was 1 mM, and the final 
concentration in the decoloration system was at 50 µM. The concentration of the 
sodium formate solution used was 1 M, and the final concentration in the system was 
21 mM. The concentration of the AQDS solution used was 0.01 M, and the final 
concentration in the system was 100 µM. The concentration of the phosphate 
buffering saline solution used was 10 mM at pH 7. All of the prepared vials were 
sealed with gold/alumina top seals with PTFE-faced butyl rubber liners. The 
headspace was filled with nitrogen. 
The samples were incubated at 30 °C, unless otherwise stated, without shaking. for 7 
days. Absorbance readings were taken daily at 597 nm using a Specord S 100 
UV-visible spectrophotometer (Spectronic Analytical Instruments. Leeds, UK). The 
technique was that described in more detail in Section 2.5.3. At the same time as the 
81 absorbance was measured, photographic representations were taken using a digital 
camera (Nikon COOLPIX2500). Each experiment was carried out in triplicate. 
2.3 Colour reduction of metal-complex azo dye solutions 
using planktonic cells of Shewanella strain J18 143 
The colour removal of reactive azo dyes using the biological cells, Shewafnella strain 
J 18 143 has been studied and well developed (Willmott, 1997: Kamilaki, 2000 and 
Pearce, 2004). The research described in this section is focused on the colour 
reduction of another large group of azo dyes, i. e. the metal complexes. 
Metal-complex azo dyes represent an important class of dyes in the textile industries 
due to their excellent light fastness. Their share is estimated to be approximately 
30% in wool dyeing and 40% in polyamide fibre dyeing (Hunger, 2003). In 
commercial terms, the most important metal-complex dyes are the chromium 
complexes, the cobalt complexes and the copper complexes with azo ligands. Four 
representatives of the textile dyes were chosen for the study of colour reduction of 
metal-complex azo dyes using Shewanella strain J 18 143 cells. These dyes were the 
mono-azo metal-complex dyes, Irgalan Grey GLN, Irgalan Black RBLN, Irgalan 
Blue 3GL and Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWL respectively. The dyes were obtained from 
Ciba Specialty Chemicals (Ciba Specialty Chemicals PLC, Macclesfield, UK). 
2.3.1 Materials 
Irgalan Grey GLN, Irgalan Black RBLN, Irgalan Blue 3GL and Irgalan Yellow 3RL 
KWL were chosen with respect to being a typical dyes that exist in metal-complex 
azo dye-based textile effluents after polyamide and wool dyeing processes. One 
objective was to evaluate the reduction efficiency of the planktonic cells with respect 
to these colorants. 
84 Irgalan Grey GLN is a mixture of two metal-complex azo dyes. Irgalan Black RBLN 
(di sodium [3-hydroxy-4-[(2-hydroxy-l-naphthyl)azo]-1-naphthalenesulphonato(3-)[1 
-[[2-hydroxy-5-[(p-methoxyphenyl)azo]phenyl]azo]-2-naphtholato(2-)] chromate(2-). 
70-80%, Figure 2.3.1) and Irgalan Blue 3GL (disodium [6-amino-5-[(2- 
hydroxy-4-nitrophenyl)azo]-N-methylnaphthalene-2-sulphonamidato(2-)] [6-amino- 
5-[(2-hydroxy-4-nitrophenyl)azo] naphthalene-2-sulphonato(3-) cobaltate(2-), 5-10%, 
Figure 2.3.2). Irgalan Black RBLN has a black shade and is a mono -sulphonated 1: 2 
metal-complex dye that is used for dyeing and printing wool and polyamide fibres. 
Irgalan Blue 3GL has a colour that in greenish blue. It is a non-sulphonated I:? 
metal-complex dye that is also used for dyeing and printing wool and polyamide 
fibres.

Figure 2.3.3 The Chemical Structure of the Chromophore in Irgalan Yellow 3RL K«'L 
86 Information concerning the dyes was provided by Ciba Specialty Chemicals 
(Macclesfield, UK). All of the dyes were used without further purification. 
Colour reductions of solutions of the four selected metal-complex dyes were carried 
out using the Shewanella strain J18 143 cells. All of the colour reductions of the 
metal-complex dye solutions were carried out in buffered saline media. 
AIM solution of sodium formate in the phosphate buffer saline (P. B. S.. 10 mM, pH 
7) was used as electron donor, at a final concentration of 21 mM, in all of the 
subsequent colour reductions of separate solutions of Irgalan Grey GLN, Irgalan 
Black RBLN, Irgalan Blue 3GL and Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWL. A solution of 
electron shuttle, anthraquinone-2,6-disulphonic acid (AQDS, 10 mM), was prepared 
in P. B. S. (10 mM, pH 7) and was used in the systems, providing the colour reduction 
of Irgalan Grey GLN, Irgalan Blue 3GL, Irgalan Black RBLN and Irgalan Yellow 
3RL KWL, at a final concentration of 100 µM. 
The decoloration experiments were carried out in autosampler vials (size 10 cm3, cap 
23 x 46 mm) that were obtained from Kimble Glass Inc. (Vineland, New Jersey, 
USA) sealed with 20 mm gold/alumina top seals with PTFE-faced, butyl rubber 
liners, obtained from Alltech Associates/Applied Sciences (Carnforth, Lancashire, 
UK). The headspaces of all of the vessels used were degassed with nitrogen gas after 
being sealed. 
All of the general chemicals were of analytical grade and were obtained from 
Sigma-Aldrich (Dorset, UK), unless otherwise stated. 
2.3.2 Preparation of the Shewanella strain J18 143 cells 
The colour reduction of each of the selected metal-complex azo dyes, Irgalan Grey 
GLN, Irgalan Black RBLN. Irgalan Blue 3GL and Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWL, was 
carried out using a suspension of freshly prepared Sheivanella strain J 18 143 cells. 
87 The procedures for preparing the cell suspension of Shewanella strain J 18 143 were 
described in Section 2.1.2.5. Each cell suspension was used immediately after 
preparation. 
2.3.3 Colour reduction of solutions of the Irgalan Grey GLN 
metal-complex azo dye using the planktonic cells of 
Shewanella strain J18 143 
Colour reduction from the solutions of Irgalan Grey GLN using planktonic cells of 
Shewanella strain J18 143, was carried out. A calibration curve of the Irgalan Grey 
GLN dye solution was assembled. Colour reduction criteria for Irgalan Grey GLN 
dye solutions, using the bacterial cells and the relative standards, were established. 
2.3.3.1 Calibration curve of the solutions of Irgalan Grey GLN 
A calibration curve of absorbance versus dye concentration for Irgalan Grey GLN 
solutions was constructed. A series of Irgalan Grey GLN solutions, with 
concentrations ranging from 7.5 mg dm-3 to 120 mg dm-3, was prepared in volumetric 
flasks. The absorbance values of the dye solutions were measured at ý, m for Irgalan 
Grey GLN (577 nm) using a Specord S 100 UV-Visible spectrophotometer 
(Spectronic Analytical Instruments, Leeds, UK). 
The absorbance, measured at the same wavelength for the same dye solution. is 
proportional to the concentration of the absorbing medium. The analysis method 
used in preparation of calibration curve of the targeted dye solution is described in 
Section 2.5.3. 
The calibration curve was used to calculate the amount of Irgalan Grey GLN that had 
been reduced in each experiment. 
88 2.3.3.2 Reduction of solutions of the Irgalan Grey GLN metal-complex dye 
using the planktonic cells of Shewanella strain J18 143 
All of the reduction investigations were carried out using 10 cm3 vials. Each vial 
contained a solution of Irgalan Grey GLN, sodium formate, anthraquinone-2.6- 
disulphonic acid disodium salt (AQDS), prepared cell suspension (0.5 cm') and 
known amounts of phosphate buffer saline solution to make up 9.5 cm3 in total 
volume, unless otherwise stated. The concentration of Irgalan Grey GLN in solution 
was 1.6 g dm-3. The final concentration of the dye in solution in the decoloration 
system was 0.08 g dm-3. The concentration of the sodium formate solution used was 
I M, and the final concentration in the system was 21 mM. The concentration of the 
AQDS solution used was 0.01 M, and the final concentration in the system was 100 
µM. The concentration of the phosphate buffering saline solution used was 10 mM 
and the pH was 7. All of the prepared vials were sealed with gold/alumina top seals 
with PTFE-faced butyl rubber liners (Alltech Associates/Applied Sciences, Carnforth, 
UK) and the headspaces were filled with nitrogen. 
The samples were incubated at 30 °C, unless otherwise stated, without shaking, for 7 
days. Absorbance readings were taken daily at wavelength of 577 nm using a 
Specord S 100 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Spectronic Analytical Instruments, 
Leeds, UK). At the same time, photographic representations of the samples were 
taken using a digital camera (Olympus C-370). Each experiment was carried out in 
triplicate. 
2.3.3.3 Establishment of dye solution standards 
The colour reduction system was designed to reduce the colour from the Irgalan Grey 
GLN dye solution, using the planktonic bacterial cells of Shewanella strain J 18 143. 
with the existing of sodium formate solution and anthraquinone-2.6-disulphonic acid 
(AQDS) solution. To have an appreciation of the colour removal that had been 
brought about by the biological cells, as prepared in Section 2.3.2, standards needed 
to be prepared, for comparisons. All of the standards had been treated under the same 
89 conditions and same procedures as those for the colour reduction samples. The 
standards were incubated at 30 °C, unless otherwise stated, without shaking, for 7 
days. Absorbance readings were taken daily at 577 nm using a Specord S 100 
UV-visible spectrophotometer. At the same time, photographic representations were 
taken using a digital camera (Olympus C-370). Each experiment was carried out in 
triplicate. 
On decoloration of the targeted dye solution, the colour of the treated samples would 
be expected to change with time. The durations of the treatments were varied. Thus, 
a control based on the targeted dye solution without any addition of biological cells 
was needed throughout the process. Such vials were prepared with the Irgalan Grey 
GLN dye solution (final concentration 0.08 g dm-3), sodium formate (final 
concentration 21 mM), AQDS, (final concentration 100 µM) and P. B. S. solution (10 
mM, pH 7) to make 9.5 cm3 in total volume. 
2.3.3.4 Establishment of planktonic cells standard 
The biological cells used in the reduction systems were prepared as a suspension in 
the phosphate buffer saline solutions. 0.5 cm3 of each cell suspension were added to 
each of the evaluated systems, contained a total volume of 9.5 cm3. The effect of the 
planktonic Shewanella strain J 18 143 cells on the absorbance of the reduction system, 
without the addition of any dye solution, needed to be investigated. The vials of the 
planktonic cells standard contained sodium formate (final concentration 21 mM). 
AQDS (final concentration 100 µM), prepared cell suspension (0.5 cm3) and known 
amounts of P. B. S. solution (10 mM, pH 7) to make the final volume to 9.5 cm3. 
2.3.3.5 Particle size analysis 
Particle size analysis using a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments Ltd., 
Worcestershire, UK) was carried out to determine the effect of the bacterial cells of 
Sheminella strain J18 143 on the particle size of the "solutions". The "solutions" 
tested were the Irgalan Grey GLN standard, the dye treated with the bacterial cells 
90 and the cell suspension standard after an incubation of 18 hours. More description 
relating to the use of particle size analysis is given in Section 2.5.4. 
2.3.4 Colour reduction of metal-complex azo dye solutions (Irgalan 
Black RBLN and Irgalan Blue 3GL) using the planktonic cells 
of Shewanella strain J18 143 
The metal-complex azo dye, Irgalan Grey GLN was mainly composed of mo 
chromophores, Irgalan Black RBLN and Irgalan Blue 3GL (Section 2.3.1.1). The 
chromate complex in Irgalan Grey GLN is the main chromophore, which is 60-70% 
content of the metal-complex dye of Irgalan Black RBLN (Figure 2.3.1). The 
cobaltate complex in Irgalan Grey GLN is the main chromophore, which is 60-70% 
content of the metal-complex dye of Irgalan Blue 3GL (Figure 2.3.2). The studies of 
the colour reduction of these two dyes were carried out respectively using the 
planktonic bacterial cells of Shewanella strain J 18 143. 
2.3.4.1 Calibration curve of the solutions of Irgalan Black RBLN and Irgalan 
Blue 3GL 
Calibration curves of absorbance versus dye concentration of Irgalan Black RBLN 
solutions and of Irgalan Blue 3GL were constructed. A series of Irgalan Black RBLN 
solutions, with concentrations ranging from 40 mg dm-3 to 120 mg dm-3, were 
prepared in volumetric flasks. The absorbance of the dye solutions was measured at 
kmax for Irgalan Black RBLN (572 nm) using a Specord S l00 UV-Visible 
spectrophotometer (Spectronic Analytical Instruments, Leeds, UK). A series of 
Irgalan Blue 3GL solutions, with concentrations ranging from 20 mg dm-3 to 120 mg 
dm-3, were prepared in volumetric flasks. Absorbance of the dye solutions was 
measured at k, ma., for Irgalan Blue 3GL (637 nm) using a Specord S100 UV-Visible 
spectrophotometer. The absorbance, measured at the same wavelength for the same 
dye solution. i. e. with the same absorption coefficient, is proportional to the 
91 concentration of the absorbing medium (Section 2.5.3). The calibration curve was 
used to calculate the amount of dye that had been reduced in each experiment. 
2.3.4.2 Colour Reduction from solutions of Irgalan Black RBLN and Irgalan 
Blue 3GL using the planktonic cells of Shewanella strain J18 143 
The colour reduction of the Irgalan Black RBLN dye solutions and of the Irgalan 
Blue 3GL dye solutions was carried out at the same conditions for each of the dye 
solutions. The reduction investigations were carried out in 10 cm3 vials and in sealed, 
anaerobic, precision cuvettes (10 mm) made of Quartz SUPRASIL® (Heilma UK 
Ltd., Southend-on Sea, Essex, UK). Each vial/cuvettes contained the metal-complex 
azo dye solution (Irgalan Black RBLN or Irgalan Blue 3GL), sodium formate, 
anthraquinone-2,6-disulphonic acid disodium salt (AQDS), prepared cell suspension 
(0.5 cm3 in vial or 0.16 cm3 in cuvettes) and known amounts of phosphate buffer 
saline solution to make up 9.5 cm3 (in vial) or 3.0 cm3 (in cuvettes) in total volume, 
unless otherwise stated. The concentration of the dye solution prepared (Irgalan Grey 
GLN or Irgalan Blue 3GL) was 1.6 g dm-3. The final amount of the dye solution in 
the decoloration system was 0.08 g dm"3. The concentration of the sodium formate 
solution used was 1 M, and the final concentration in the system was 21 mM. The 
concentration of the AQDS solution used was 0.01 M, and the final concentration in 
the system was 100 µM. The concentration of the phosphate buffering saline solution 
used was 10 mM and the pH was 7. All of the prepared vials were sealed with 
gold/alumina top seals with PTFE-faced butyl rubber liners (Alltech 
Associates/Applied Sciences, Carnforth, UK). The headspaces of the vials and of the 
cuvettes were filled with nitrogen. 
The samples were incubated at 30 °C, unless otherwise stated, without shaking, for 7 
days. Absorbance readings were taken daily at 572 nm for the investigation of the 
colour reduction of the Irgalan Black RBLN dye solutions and at 637 nm for the 
investigation of the colour reduction of the Irgalan Blue 3GL dye solutions, using a 
Specord S100 tUV-visible spectrophotometer. At the same time, photographic 
91 representations were taken by a digital camera (Nikon COOLPIX2500). Each 
experiment was carried out in triplicate. 
2.3.4.3 Establishment of dye solution standards 
The colour reduction system was designed to reduce the colour from the selected 
metal-complex azo dye solutions using the bacterial cells of Shetivanella strain J 18 
143 in the presence of the sodium formate solution and anthraquinone-2,6- 
disulphonic acid (AQDS) solution. To have an appreciation of the colour removal 
that was brought by the biological cells, standards needed to be prepared. 
All of the standards were treated under the same conditions and same procedures as 
those used for the colour reduction samples. The standards were incubated at 30 °C, 
unless otherwise stated, without shaking, for 7 days. Absorbance readings were taken 
daily at 572 nm for the Irgalan Black RBLN standards and at 637 nm for the Irgalan 
Blue 3GL standards, using a Specord S 100 UV-visible spectrophotometer 
(Spectronic Analytical Instruments, Leeds, UK). At the same time, photographic 
representations were taken using a digital camera (Nikon COOLPIX2500). Each 
experiment was carried out in triplicate. 
If decoloration treatment of the targeted dye solution occurred, the colour density of 
the treated samples would be expected to change in a controlled way. The duration of 
the treatment were varied. Thus, a control of targeted dye solution of each dye 
solution (Irgalan Black RBLN and Irgalan Blue 3GL) without any addition of 
biological cells was needed respectively throughout the process. The vials were 
prepared on the basis of dye solution (final concentration 0.08 g dm"3), sodium 
formate (final concentration 21 mM), AQDS, (final concentration 100 µM) and 
P. B. S. solution (10 mM, pH 7) to make 9.5 cm3 (in the 10 cm3 vial) or 3.0 cm3 (in 
the anaerobic cuvettes) in total volume. 
9ý 2.3.4.4 Establishment of planktonic cells standard 
The biological cells used in the reduction systems were prepared as a suspension in 
the phosphate buffer saline solutions. 0.5 cm3 of cell suspension was added to each 
of the evaluated systems, contained to total volume of 9.5 cm3. The effect of the free 
Shewanella strain J 18 143 cells on the absorbance of the reduction system without 
the addition of any dye solutions needed to be investigated. The vials of the 
planktonic cells standard contained sodium formate (final concentration 21 mM), 
AQDS, (final concentration 100 µM), prepared cell suspension (0.16 cm3) and 
certain amounts of P. B. S. solution to make the final up to 9.5 cm3. 
2.3.5 Colour reduction from solutions of Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWL 
dye using the planktonic cells of Shewanella strain J18 143 
Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWL was one of the metal-complex azo dye selected for the 
colour reduction study. The chemical structure of the main chromophore in this dye 
was given in Section 2.3.1.1 (Figure 2.3.3). The calibration curve of the Irgalan 
Yellow 3RL KWL was established. Colour reduction of the dye solution of this 
yellow dye and the related standards were features of this section of the total study. 
2.3.5.1 Calibration curve for solutions of Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWL 
A calibration curve of absorbance versus dye concentration for Irgalan Yellow 3RL 
KWL solution was constructed. A series of Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWL solutions, with 
concentrations ranging from 10 mg dm-3 to 80 mg dm-3, was prepared using 
volumetric flasks. The absorbance of the dye solutions was measured at Xm,, for the 
Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWL (456 nm) using a Specord S 100 UV-Visible 
spectrophotometer (Spectronic Analytical Instruments, Leeds. UK). The calibration 
curve was used to calculate the amount of Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWL that had been 
reduced in each experiment (Section 2.5.3). 
94 2.3.5.2 Reduction of solutions of Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWL using the 
planktonic cells of Shewanella strain J18 143 
All of the reduction investigations were carried out in 10 cm3 vials. Each vial 
contained the Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWL dye solution, sodium formate. 
anthraquinone-2,6-disulphonic acid disodium salt (AQDS), prepared cell suspension 
(0.5 cm3) and certain amounts of phosphate buffer saline solution to make up 9.5 cm3 
in total volume, unless otherwise stated. The concentration of the solution of Irgalan 
Grey Yellow 3RL KWL 250% was 2.4 g dm-3, and the final concentration in the 
decoloration system was at 0.12 g dm-3. The concentration of the sodium formate 
solution used was 1 M, and the final concentration in the system was 21 mM. The 
concentration of the AQDS solution used was 0.01 M, and the final concentration in 
the system was 100 µM. The concentration of the phosphate buffering saline solution 
used was 10 mM and pH 7. All of the prepared vials were sealed with gold/alumina 
top seals with PTFE-faced butyl rubber liners and the headspace were filled with 
nitrogen. 
The samples were incubated at 30 °C, unless otherwise stated, without shaking, for 7 
days. Absorbance readings were taken daily at 456 nm using a Specord S 100 
UV-visible spectrophotometer (Spectronic Analytical Instruments, Leeds, UK). At 
the same time, photographic representations were taken using a digital camera 
(Olympus C-370). Each experiment was carried out in triplicate. 
2.3.5.3 Establishment of dye solution standards 
The colour reduction system was designed to reduce the colour of the Irgalan Yellow 
3 RL KWL dye solution using the bacterial cells of Shewanella strain J 18 143 with 
the assistance of sodium formate solution and anthraquinone-2,6-disulphonic acid 
(AQDS) solution. To have an appreciation of the colour removal that has been 
brought by the biological cells, prepared as described in Section 2.3.2, standards 
were established. All of the standards were treated under the same conditions and 
same procedures as those for the colour reduction samples. The standards were 
95 incubated at 30 °C, unless otherwise stated, without shaking. for 7 days. Absorbance 
readings were taken daily at 456 nm using a Specord S100 U\'-visible 
spectrophotometer. At the same time, photographic representations were taken using 
a digital camera (Olympus C-370). Each experiment was carried out in triplicate. 
If decoloration treatment of the targeted dye solution occurred, the colour density of 
the treated samples would be expected to change. The duration of the treatment 
varied. Thus a control of targeted dye solution without any addition of biological 
cells was used throughout the study. The vials were prepared with dye solution of 
Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWL (final concentration 0.12 g dm-3), sodium formate (final 
concentration 21 mM), AQDS (final concentration 100 µM) and P. B. S. solution (10 
mM, pH 7) to make 9.5 cm3 in total volume. 
2.3.5.4 Establishment of planktonic cells standard 
The planktonic biological cells used in the reduction systems were prepared as a 
suspension in the phosphate buffer saline solutions. 0.5 cm3 of cell suspension was 
added in each of the evaluated systems contained a total volume of 9.5 cm3. The 
effect of the Shewanella strain J18 143 cells on the absorbance of the reduction 
system, without the addition of any dye solutions was investigated. The vials of the 
planktonic cells standard contained sodium formate (final concentration 21 mM), 
AQDS (final concentration 100 µM), prepared cell suspension (0.5 cm3) and certain 
amounts of P. B. S. solution (10 mM, pH 7) to make the final up to 9.5 cm3. 
2.3.5.5 Particle size analysis 
Particle size analysis, using a Zetasizer Nano ZS, was carried out to determine the 
effect of the bacterial cells of Sheii'anella strain J18 143 on the particle size of the 
"solutions". The "solutions" were of the Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWL standard, the dye 
treated with the bacterial cells and the cell suspension standard, after an incubation of 
18 hours. Description relating to the use of particle size analysis is given in Section 
2.5.4. 
96 2.4 Factors affecting the colour reduction of the 
metal-complex dye solutions using the planktonic cells 
of Shewanella strain J18 143 
There are several factors that might affect the colour reduction of the metal-complex 
dye solutions using the cells of Shewanella strain J18 143. Pearce (2004) studied 
some of these factors with respect to the reduction of Remazol Black B dye solutions 
using resting cell suspension of Shewanella stain J 18 143. Those factors include the 
type of electron donor, the nitrate ions, dye hydrolysis, the dye concentration, the 
temperature, the pH and the exogenous extracellular electron shuttle. In the current 
study, the effect of the dye concentration, the effect of the temperature and the effect 
of the pH were investigated for the colour reduction of the metal-complex azo dye 
solutions using biological cells. 
2.4.1 Materials 
All of the chemicals were of analytical grade and were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich 
(Dorset, UK), unless otherwise stated. 
The colour reductions of the four selected metal-complex dye solutions were carried 
out using the Shewanella stain J18 143 cells. All of the colour reductions of the 
metal-complex dye solutions were carried out in buffered saline solutions. The effect 
of pH on the colour reduction of the selected metal-complex azo dyes using 
Sheet- nnella strain J18 143 cells was investigated. A series of buffer solutions was 
prepared at different pH levels as shown in Table 2.4.1. The pH values were 
determined using a Corning 250 pH meter with a BDH Gelplus general-purpose 
combination probe.

A1M solution of sodium formate in the phosphate buffer saline (P. B. S., 10 mM, pH 
7) was used as electron donor, at a final concentration of 21 mM, in all of the 
subsequent colour reductions of separate solutions of Irgalan Grey GLN, Irgalan 
Black RBLN, Irgalan Blue 3GL and Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWL. A solution of 
electron shuttle, anthraquinone- 2,6-disulphonic acid (AQDS, 10 mM), was prepared 
in P. B. S. (10 mM, pH 7) and was used in the systems providing the colour reduction 
of Irgalan Grey GLN, Irgalan Blue 3GL, Irgalan Black RBLN and Irgalan Yellow 
3RL KWL, at a final concentration of 100 µM. 
2.4.2 Protein assay of planktonic cells of Shewanella strain J18 143 
Protein assays were carried out for all of the colour reduction studies relating to the 
metal-complex azo dyes. Each assay was used to calculate the reduction rate of the 
the in the reduction system. The reduction of the dye solutions by Shewanella strain 
J18 143 cells was then expressed as a rate, this being the concentration of dye 
solution reduced per gram of biomass per minute. The detailed operating procedures 
associated with the protein assay of the resting biological cells are given in Section 
-). ý. ý. 1. 
98 2.4.3 Effect of dye concentration on the colour reduction of the 
metal-complex azo dyes 
The concentration of metal-complex azo dye in solution would be expected to have 
an important effect on the extent and rate of dye reduction using Sheii'anella strain 
J 18 143 cells. At high dye concentrations, the rate of dye reduction could be affected 
due to the increased toxicity of the dye. In very dilute dye solutions. a low rate of dy, e 
reduction may also be experienced, as there would be insufficient dye present to be 
recognised by the dye reductase enzyme inside the cells (Pearce, 2004). 
To study the effect of dye concentration on dye reduction using Shewanella strain 
J 18 143 cells, solutions of each Irgalan metal-complex azo dye (Irgalan Grey GLN, 
Irgalan Black RBLN, Irgalan Blue 3GL and Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWL) were added 
to a series of autosampler vials (size 10 cm3, cap 23 x 46 mm) to prepare a range of 
known concentrations (40 mg dm-3 to 240 mg dm-3) respectively. A sodium formate 
solution (1 M) was added to the vials as the electron donor (final concentration, 21 
mM). A solution of AQDS was added (0.01 M), and the final concentration in the 
system was 100 µM. The assay solutions were diluted to 9.5 cm3 using P. B. S. (10 
mM, pH 7). The vials were sealed with gold/alumina top seals with PTFE-faced 
butyl rubber liners and the headspace were filled with nitrogen. The samples were 
incubated at 30 °C, without shaking. 
The absorbance of the solutions in the vials was measured periodically at the km,, for 
each dye, respectively, using a Specord S 100 spectrophotometer that was fitted with 
a temperature controlled cuvette changer. The absorbance of "blank" solutions. 
containing all the assay solutions other than the colorant, were also measured and 
used to normalise the absorbance data that were obtained from the samples 
containing the colorant. The calibration curve for each of the metal-complex azo dye 
solutions was constructed (Section 2.3.4.1. Section 2.3.4.1 and Section 2.3.5.1). The 
colour reduction rate against dye concentration was plotted, based on the results from 
the calibration curve and the protein assay. At the same time, photographic 
99 representations were taken using digital camera (Olympus C-370). The experiment 
was carried out in triplicate. 
2.4.4 Effect of temperature on the colour reduction of the 
metal-complex azo dyes 
It was realised that the temperature of the system might have a significant effect on 
the viability of the Shewanella strain J 18 143 cells and on their ability to reduce the 
colour from the solutions of the metal-complex azo dyes. 
To evaluate the effect of temperature on dye reduction using the Shewanella strain 
J 18 143 cells, a series of samples was prepared identically in autosampler vials (size 
10 cm3, cap 23 x 46 mm). Each vial contained the metal-complex azo dye solution 
(1.6 g dm-3 of Irgalan Grey GLN, Irgalan Black RBLN and Irgalan Blue 3GL or 2.4 
g dm-3 of Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWL), and the final concentration of in the 
decoloration system was at 0.08 g dm-3/0.12 g dm-3. A sodium formate solution (I M) 
was added to the vials as the electron donor (final concentration, 21 mM). A solution 
of AQDS was added (0.01 M), and the final concentration in the system was 100 µM. 
The assay solutions were diluted to 9.5 cm3 using P. B. S. (10 mM, pH7). The vials 
were sealed with gold/alumina top seals with PTFE-faced butyl rubber liners and the 
headspace were filled with nitrogen. The samples were incubated at 24°C, 30°C. 
40°C, 50°C and 60°C, respectively, without shaking. 
The absorbance of the solutions in the vials was measured periodically at the Xma, ý for 
each of the dye solutions using a Specord S 100 spectrophotometer that was fitted 
with a temperature controlled cuvette changer. The absorbance of "blank" solutions. 
containing all of the assay solutions other than the colorant, were also measured and 
used to normalise the absorbance data that were obtained from the samples 
containing the colorant. At the same time, photographic representations were taken 
by digital camera (Olympus C-370). The colour reduction rate against dye 
100 concentration was plotted based on the results from the calibration curve and the 
protein assay. The experiment was carried out in triplicate. 
2.4.5 Effect of pH on the colour reduction of metal-complex azo 
dyes 
It was considered to be important to investigate the pH of the colour removal system 
that involves an enzymatic process, as denaturation of the relevant enzyme could 
occur if the required pH range was not maintained. The optimum pH for dye 
reduction must be determined as it gives an indication of the extent to which the 
coloured wastewater, which is often strongly alkaline, must be diluted and/or 
buffered prior to treatment (Pearce, 2004). 
To determine the optimum pH for dye reduction using the Shewanella strain J 18 143 
cells, certain specified amounts of acetate-acetic acid buffered saline solution (10 
mM, pH = 5.6), sodium phosphate buffered saline solution (10 mM, pH = 6.8 and 8.0) 
or sodium carbonate-sodium bicarbonate buffered saline solution (pH = 9.2), to make 
up 9.5 cm3 as the total volume, were used respectively (Table 2.4.1). Each vial 
contained dye solution of the metal-complex azo dye (1.6 g dm-3 of Irgalan Grey 
GLN, Irgalan Black RBLN and Irgalan Blue 3GL or 2.4 g dm-3 of Irgalan Yellow 
3RL KWL). The final dye concentration in the decoloration system was at 0.08 g 
dm-3/0.12 g dm-3. A sodium formate solution (IM) was added to the vials as the 
electron donor (final concentration, 21 mM). A solution of AQDS was added (0.01 
M), and the final concentration in the system was 100 µM. 
The absorbance of the solutions in the vials was measured periodically at the Xa, ý for 
each of the dye solutions using a Specord S 100 spectrophotometer that was fitted 
with a temperature controlled cuvette changer. The absorbance of "blank" solutions, 
containing all the assay solutions other than the colorant, was also measured and 
used to normalise the absorbance data that were obtained from the samples 
containing the colorant. At the same time, photographic representations were taken 
101 by digital camera (Olympus C-370). The colour reduction rate against dy e 
concentration was plotted based on the results from the calibration curve and the 
protein assay. The experiment was carried out in triplicate. 
2.5 Analysis and characterisation methods 
Several methods were used throughout the experimental work relating to the 
characterisation and analysis of the stating materials and the resulting products. 
2.5.1 Gravimetric analysis 
The rate of the graft copolymerisation was monitored as described in Section 2.1.1.2. 
Since the extent of grafting was designed to be somewhat limited (less than 10%), it 
was not possible to control the exact grafting rate. The factors affecting the 
measurement of the grafting process could vary due to the physical properties of the 
immobilisation substrate. Gravimetric analysis was chosen and was carried out under 
careful control. The extent of grafting was determined by measuring the weight 
changes of the treated cellulose related to those of the ungrafted cellulose standard. 
2.5.2 Analysis using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) 
Scanning electron microscopic evaluations were carried out on the cellulosic 
substrate, on the cellulose based copolymer and on the biological cells. 
To observe the surface morphology of the pre-treated cellulose and the cellulosic 
graft copolymer, samples were mounted on SEM stubs, using double sided tape, and 
then coated with gold in a Bio-Rad Microscience Division gold coater (75 seconds at 
2 kV). 
For the observation of the bacterial cells, inorganic membranes (Whatman Anodisc). 
with a pore size of 0.02 µm, were used. Diluted cell suspension was dropped onto the 
102 membrane, which was supported by a Millipore sintered glass holder. fitted into a 
standard filter flask. Excess liquid was extracted that «-as allowed the bacterial cells 
lay on the top of the membrane. A small piece of the membrane that contained the 
bacterial cells was attached onto the SEM stubs using the double sided tape. The rest 
procedures were the same as those of the cellulosic substrates. 
The samples were analysed using a Joel JSM-820 scanning electron microscope, 
with a5 kV, 10 kV or 15 kV electron beam. The magnification was varied depending 
upon the type of sample being analysed (Goldstein et al., 2003). 
2.5.3 Analysis using UV-visible spectrophotometry 
UV-visible spectrophotometry is often used to analyse solutions or dispersions in the 
quantitative determination of components that absorb/scatter in the UV or visible 
regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The usual region of absorbance which is of 
interest in the current study is in the range 190 nm to 700 nm. The scattering aspect 
depends on the nature of the particles, as seen in their loading, their size and their 
various distributions. 
A SPECORD S100 Diode Array UV-visible Spectrophotometer supplied with 
WinASPECT software (Spectronic Analytical Instruments, Leeds, UK) was used. 
The spectrophotometer was equipped with a temperature controlled cuvette changer. 
A halogen lamp provides a basis for detection in the UV region of the spectrum (190 
nm - 340 nm). A deuterium lamp is available for detection in the visible region of 
the spectrum (340 nm - 700 nm). The unit was connected to a PC with AJ-UVVIS 
software. S 100 Device Driver software was used to control the measurement 
processes and the processing of the measured data. 
The UV-visible spectrophotometric technique was used in preparation of planktonic 
cell suspension (Section 2.1.1.5) to control the amounts of bacterial cells that were 
used in the evaluating systems. The bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation 
and were washed with phosphate buffer saline (P. B. S.. 10 mM, pH7) solution to 
101 remove the tryptone soy broth. The cells supernatant in P. B. S. was controlled by 
UV-visible spectrophotometeric evaluations. Each cells supernatant was diluted 10 
times to make it 0.5 in absorbance at 600 nm. This bacterial cell suspension was 
prepared every time it was required. 
UV-visible spectrophotometry was also applied during the preparation of the 
calibration curves of the dye solutions of Remazol Black B (Section 2.2.2), Irgalan 
Grey GLN (Section 2.3.3.1), Irgalan Black RBLN (Section 2.3.4.1), Irgalan Blue 
3GL (Section 2.3.4.1) and Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWL (Section 2.3.5.1). Series of 
solutions of each dye, at known concentrations, were prepared. The absorbance of 
the dye at each known concentration was measured UV-visible 
spectrophotometrically, with distilled water as a reference. The corresponding 
absorbance against the known concentrations gave a calibration curve for the 
respective dye solution. A wavelength at X was chosen so that evaluations of the 
decoloration effects could be carried out. These calibration curves were useful in 
determining the unknown concentrations of the dye solution or the liquor systems 
that contained the respective dyes. The UV-visible spectrophotometric method was 
also used to make calibration curve of the standard protein solution. 
The UV-visible spectrophotometric technique was used to monitor the processes of 
colour reduction of the dye solutions (Section 2.2, Section 2.3 and Section 2.4) that 
in the quantitative determination of chromophoric compounds in mixtures. The 
optical densities of the samples, at kn,,, were measured regularly for the required 
periods of time. The change of the absorbance values of the measured solutions 
against the incubation period was used to monitor the change of the colour of the 
measured samples. The respective spectra were also used in illustrating the change of 
the colour of the measured samples. 
104 2.5.4 Particle sizing analysis 
The particle size of the studied samples was assessed in those instances in which 
some precipitation of colorant was observed. The particle size analysis was carried 
out using a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Worcestershire. UK). 
The particle size distribution of the standard dye "solution", the dye "solution" with 
the biological cells and the cell suspension standard, after incubation of 18 hours at 
30°C, was investigated. This analytical method was used in the studies of the colour 
reduction of the Irgalan Grey GLN and of the Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWL. 
2.5.5 Protein assay 
The protein assay was applied in two usages in the studies, the protein assay of 
immobilised biological cells of Shewanella strain J18 143 and the protein assay of 
planktonic resting cell suspension of Shewanella strain J 18 143. 
The protein assay method described by Pearce (2004) was used to measure the 
protein concentration in both of the situations. It was carried out using a 
bicinchoninic acid assay kit. 
2.5.5.1 Protein assay of planktonic cells 
To start a protein assay of resting cell suspension, the standard solutions shown in 
Table 2.5.1, containing Bovine Serum Albumin and phosphate buffer saline (P. B. S.. 
10 mM, pH 7), were prepared in disposable cuvettes. 
A mixture of bicinchoninic acid-copper sulphate solution (50: 1,1 cm3) was prepared. 
1.0 cm3 of the mixture was added to each of the disposable cuvettes. The cuvettes 
were left to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. After this time, the absorbance 
at 562 nm, of each of the solutions, with P. B. S. (10 mM, pH 7) as the reference, was 
measured. A calibration curve of absorbance versus protein concentration was 
105 produced from the absorbance of these standard solutions containing known 
concentrations of Bovine Serum Albumin protein.

The Bovine Serum Albumin calibration curve and the absorbance of the solutions 
that contained the samples of resting cell suspension were used to determine the 
protein concentration and, therefore, the amount of biomass that was responsible for 
the reduction of the dye solutions. 
2.5.5.2 Protein assay of immobilised biological cells 
The grafted cellulose was cut into same sized pieces of 1 x2 cm. These pieces then 
underwent immobilisation procedures (Section 2.1.1.2). The grafted cellulose pieces 
with immobilised cells were used for protein assay. 
The protein assay was performed with in 96-well microtiter plates and an Anthos 
2001 plate reader equipped with kinetic software (Jencons Scientific Ltd.. Leighton 
Buzzard, UK). The samples were prepared in the 96-well microtiter plate as 
indicated in Table 2.5.2. In Table 2.5.2, Al to Al0 contained the standard protein 
solution (S 1 to S5 in duplicate). This approach was used to produce the calibration 
curve for the standard protein solution. BI to B12 contained the cellulosic substrates 
on which the cells were immobilised by the method of physical adsorption (GC Ad). 
106 Cl to C12 contained the cellulosic substrates on which the cells were immobilised by 
the method of chemical coupling (GC CC). Dito D12 contained the cellulosic 
substrates with immobilised cells that the cells were immobilised by the method of 
"growing-in" (GC GI). The standard protein solution was prepared as same as 
described in Section 2.5.5.1. The immobilised cells (B 1 to D 12) were immersed in 50 
p dm-3 of P. B. S. solution (10 mM, pH 7). 1.0 cm-3 of the mixture (bicinchoninic 
acid-copper sulphate solution) was added to each of the well. The 96-well plate was 
then left in incubator at 30°C for 30 minutes.

The absorbance values of the standard protein solution and of the substrates with

107 3 Results and Discussion 
In this chapter, the results obtained from the experimental work described in Chapter 
2 are presented for discussion. The research work was carried out in two parts. These 
concern (i) the removal of colour from standard solutions of reactive azo dyes using 
immobilised biological cells and (ii) the removal of colour from standard aqueous 
solutions of metal-complex azo dyes using planktonic resting biological cells. 
Shewanella strain J 18 143 cells were used throughout the work. 
In Section 3.1, the results from the immobilisation of the bacterial cells are presented. 
These include the results arising from the preparation of the immobilisation substrate, 
from the preparation of the resting cells and from the immobilisation of the bacterial 
cells using different immobilising methods. 
In Section 3.2, the results from the decoloration of Remazol Black B dye solutions 
using immobilised cells, created by different immobilising methods, are compared 
and discussed. The removal of colour from the dye solutions using immobilised 
bacterial cells is also compared with the results obtained using planktonic whole 
bacterial cells. 
In Section 3.3, the reduction of solutions of metal-complex azo dyes using the 
Shewanella strain J18 143 is characterised. This involved the reduction of four 
Irgalan dyes, namely, Irgalan Grey GLN, Irgalan Black RBLN, Irgalan Blue 3GL 
and Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWL. Irgalan Grey GLN is a mixture of the Irgalan Blue 
3GL and Irgalan Black RBLN. 
The effect of the dye concentration, the temperature and the pH on dye reduction 
efficiency is discussed in Section 3.4 with respect to each selected individual 
metal-complex azo dye. The results obtained from the biological cell-induced dye 
reductions are expressed with respect to the specific reduction rates, which were 
calculated from the results of protein assays. 
108 3.1 Preparation of the immobilisation substrate and the 
immobilisation of biological cells 
The first step of the experimental work involved an attempt to immobilise bacterial 
cells of Shewanella strain J18 143 onto a cellulosic copolymer substrate, with the 
aim of using the immobilised cells in the decoloration of coloured textile wastewater. 
The results obtained during the work are presented, discussed and analysed. 
3.1.1 Preparation of cellulosic copolymer-based immobilisation 
substrate 
Immobilising biological cells onto cellulosic graft copolymer substrates has shown 
much potential in applications, as mentioned in the introduction (Section 1.5.3). 
Cellulose is a linear polymer that exhibits a high degree of crystallinity in its native 
state. There is strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding between adjacent cellulose 
chains due to the presence of the hydroxyl groups (three per anhydroglucose unit) 
(Roy et al., 2005). Therefore, not all of these OH groups are accessible to 
copolymerisation. Thus, a swelling/cleansing pre-treatment of cellulose is required if 
one wishes to create a reasonably homogeneously grafted copolymeric material. 
Without such treatment, grafting would be restricted to the surface of the cellulosic 
fibrils. The cellulose cotton was pre-treated according to the method used by Sabaa 
and Mokhtar (2002) as descried in Section 2.1.1.1. Scanning electron microscopy 
(SEM) was employed to "view" the surface of the pre-treated cellulose (Section 
2.5.2). An electron beam intensity of 15 keV was shown to be suitable for the 
samples, giving good resolution. Figure 3.1.1 shows a representation of the 
corresponding fibres of the pre-treated cellulose. 
The pre-treated cellulose underwent graft copolymerisation, with methacrylic acid 
(MAA) as the monomer and potassium persulphate as the initiator, as described in 
109 Section 2.1.1.2. Although methacrylic acid has been shown to provide a relatively 
low grafting rate (Zahran et al., 2004), the rate achieved and the grafting 
characteristics provided were deemed to be suitable for the study. 
r-, - 
Figure 3.1.1 Scanning Electron Micrograph (SEM) of Pre-treated Cellulose 
The grafting of vinyl and acrylic monomers onto cellulose, using persulphate radicals, 
has been studied extensively (Sabaa and Mokhtar, 2002). The mechanism for the 
thermal decomposition of persulphate ions in aqueous solution is shown below. The 
polymerisation of vinyl monomers can be initiated by either the S04*- or HO* 
radicals (Tune, 1989). 
S2082- -> 2SO4: 
SO4; + H, 0- HSO4 + HO 
2H00 HO 
Methacrylic acid (MAA) is a water-soluble monomer, and poly(methacrylic acid) is 
also soluble in water. The products from the grafting process comprised of blends of 
110 cellulose-MAA graft copolymer, PMAA homopolymer and any ungrafted cellulose. 
The removal of as much as PMAA homopolymer as was possible from these 
products was achieved by extensive Soxhlet extraction with boiling water. Howl ever. 
it was considered possible that not all of the homopolymer was removed. Thus, the 
resulting products might still have contained small amounts of occluded 
homopolymer. Since this study was concerned with preparing immobilisation 
substrates for bacterial cells, it was deemed that the presence of very small amounts 
of homopolymer would not have serious implications for the graft copolymerisation 
and the immobilisation aspects. 
Studies of grafting rates are commonly based on gravimetric methods. However, this 
approach can give rise to errors. The primary reason is the ease of moisture uptake 
by the ungrafted samples, which renders weighing difficult unless carried out under 
constant temperature and humidity conditions (Guthrie and Haq, 1974). Gravimetry 
was used in this study, great care being taken with respect to sample drying and to 
mass transfer issues (Section 2.5.1). The graft yield was calculated using the scheme 
stated in Section 2.1.1.2. A further consideration was given regarding the weight loss 
of the cellulose during the processing procedures. Blank tests were undertaken, as 
described in Section 2.1.1.2. 
The pre-treated cellulose was taken run through the whole grafting copolymerisation 
process without any monomer and any initiator being added. If the weight of the final 
product (final cellulose blank) was found to be less than that of the initial cellulose 
(initial cellulose), the weight of the final product (grafted cellulose) after graft 
copolymerisation with the addition of the monomer and the initiator was modified, 
based on the weight of the initial cellulose (initial cellulose). There is an assumption 
that the rate of the weight loss during the grafting copolymerisation, which is 
unavoidable due to the nature of the cellulosic system (rather broad molar mass 
distribution), remains the same during the blank test. The acquired information was 
then used when calculating the grafting extent, as described in the following 
schemes. For the blank: 
Weight Loss (%) = 
For the copolymer: Final Cellulose Weight (Blank) - Initial Cellulose HWeight)x 100% 
Initial Cellulose Weight 
Weight Gain (%) =Grafted Cellulose Weight - Initial Cellulose Weight)x 100% 
Initial Cellulose Weight 
Grafting Yield (%) = Weight Gain (%) + Weight Loss (%) 
The concentration of both the monomer [CH2C(CH3)COOH] and the initiator 
(K2S208) has an effect on the final grafting yield. A series of tests was carried out 
(Section 2.1.1.2) in this respect. The concentration of the initiator to be used in the 
experiment was then determined as 0.075 mol dm"3, and the concentration of the 
monomer used was fixed at 0.5 mol dm-3. The grafting yield averaged 5.5%. This 
yield of grafting provides sufficient reactive sites to allow the biological cells to be 
immobilised, since the extent of grafting was designed to be somewhat limited (less 
than 10%). This largely removes the prospect of creating an environment that would 
be inherently hostile to the cells that were to be subsequently immobilised. In 
addition, the fibrous nature of the substrate is maintained. Handling procedures were 
not compromised. 
Figure 3.1.2 represents the image obtained from SEM of the grafted cellulose. An 
electron beam intensity of 15 keV was used. The image shows evidence of surface 
change without great changes to the overall form of the fibre matrix. The change 
should be seen in comparison with the image of the pre-treated cellulose (Figure 
3.1.1). The sample of the pre-treated cellulose consists of long, interwoven. 
orientated fibres. Close examination of the fibre surface reveals smoothness and a 
good level of homogeneity. With the cellulose-MAA graft copolymer (Figure 3.1.2), 
11? the first indications are of the damage of the fibre surface and "bridging" between the 
fibres. These changes depict regions for possible grafting.

Figure 3.1.2 Scanning Electron Micrograph (SEM) of Grafted Cellulose 
To support the conclusion drawn from the comparison of the images (Figure 3.1.1 
and Figure 3.1.2), titrimetric analysis was constructed (Section 2.1.1.2). The average 
concentration of -000H groups on the copolymer was determined as 0.1±0.01 mol 
dm-3. Therefore, these would imply that there is sufficient evidence to show that the 
methacrylic acid was either grafted onto cellulose to a low grafting extent and/or that 
occluded homopolymer was present. In view of the exhaustive extraction procedures 
that were used, the view of the occurrence of covalent linking, through grafting, is 
favoured. 
3.1.2 Preparation of biological cells - Shewanella strain J18 143 
The bacterial culture was isolated and identified as Shewanella putrefaciens, a 
gram-negative motile bacterium. It is a facultative anaerobe that can use the 
113 nitrogen-nitrogen bond in the reactive azo dye as an electron acceptor for anaerobic 
respiration. 
The techniques relating to the aseptic handling of Shewanella strain J18 143 in 
aspects of culture storage, cell growth and preparation of resting cells have been well 
presented (Willmott, 1997; Pearce, 2004). 
3.1.2.1 Culture storage 
The bacterial strains used were primarily stored in agar slopes (Section 2.1.2.3) as 
shown in the circle in Figure 3.1.3. A pink layer of the bacteria of Shewanella strain 
J 18 143 can be observed on the surface of the slope. 
Figure 3.1.3 Bacterial Culture Stored on Agar Slope 
Figure 3.1.4 represents the culture of Shewanella strain J18 143 that was streaked 
onto the surface of an agar plate. A pink, streaking layer on the surface of the 
medium can be seen. Also, colonies of the strains can be recognised from the image. 
There were two aims in employing the streak-plate technique. One was for 
short-term storage (see Section 2.1.2.3), whereby the plate can be stored in incubator 
at 30°C for a period of up to one week. Another purpose, probably the more 
important one, was to check for the presence and absence of any contaminants 
(Section 2.1.2.2).

The bacterial cells of Shewanella strain J18 143 were finally prepared in a cell 
suspension using aseptic techniques, as introduced in Section 2.1.2.4. The cell 
suspension prepared was diluted and was investigated using scanning electron 1

115 Figure 3.1.5 Scanning Electron Micrograph of Prepared Cell Suspension microscopy (SEM). An electron beam intensity of 15 kV was used. Figure 3.1.5 
contains the image obtained from the SEM analysis. The image represents the cell 
suspension that is shown in layers of the individuals, indicating the basic information 
that the strain is rod shaped. The sharp definitions, shown in the images, suggested 
that whole cells are being viewed. 
3.1.3 Immobilisation of Shewanella strain J18 143 
Immobilisation of the Shewanella strain J18 143 cells was performed using three 
methods (Klein and Wagner, 1983; Gil, 1983; Willmott, 1997). The results from the 
immobilisation of the bacterial cells using the method of "growing-in", that of 
physical adsorption and that of chemical coupling are discussed throughout Section 
3.2. 
3.1.3.1 Attempts at protein assay of immobilised Shewanella strain J18 143 
Attempts were made to establish SEM images of cells that had been immobilised on 
the cellulose copolymer substrate. However, the cells cannot be "seen" under SEM. 
This was thought, in part to be due to the heterogeneous nature of the matrix of the 
grafted cellulose, or because of the location of the cells being immobilised. Therefore, 
an alternative way of the establishing the presence of the immobilised cells «was 
attempted. This was based on a protein assay procedure. A further problem 
concerned the method of the protein assay of the immobilised cells. Several methods 
are quoted in the literature (von Canstein, personal communication, 2005; 
Ramachandran, 2004). Each of these was tried. None of them provided consistently 
satisfactory results. The focus was then moved from quantitative analysis to 
qualitative analysis. Thus, protein assays of the immobilised cells were carried out 
using the method based on the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay as used in the protein 
assay of the planktonic cells. 
116 The principle of the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay is similar to that which 
underpins the Lowry procedure, in that both rely on the formation of a Cup--protein 
complex under alkaline conditions, followed by reduction of the Cup- to Cu' - 
(www. sigmaldrich. com). BCA forms a purple-blue complex with Cult in alkaline 
environments. The reduction of alkaline Cu 2+ by proteins giving an absorbance 
maximum 562 nm was then monitored by LTV-visible spectroscopy. The procedures 
of the protein assay of the immobilised cells were described in Section 2.5.5.2. The 
calibration plot of protein standard solution is shown in Figure 3.1.6.

The samples of the cellulosic graft copoh mer that contained the immobilised cells, 
represented within each column (B, C and D in Table 3.1.1) were dupicately taken 
118 from six identical evaluation sets (1 to 6). However, it can be seen that the 
concentrations of the protein that was calculated for the immobilised cell systems, as 
indicated in Table 3.1.1, are not consistent across the two batches. These results 
imply that the protein concentration of the immobilised cells of each individual 
sample used in the subsequent colour removal systems, measured using this method, 
cannot be deemed to be reliable, to a sufficient degree of accuracy. Therefore, the use 
of the BCA protein assay kit was only used to provide evidence that the bacterial 
cells, Shewanella strain J18 143, were immobilised on the substrate of the cellulosic 
graft copolymer. Further study will need to be undertaken on the basis of the results 
obtained, as presented. The assay shows that the cells are obviously present even if 
their presence cannot be quantified. 
3.2 Decoloration of Remazol Black B solutions using 
immobilised Shewanella strain J18 143 cells 
Remazol Black B is characteristic of a bifunctional reactive azo dye. It is an 
azo-ketohydrazone chromophore and two vinyl sulphone reactive centres that can 
potentially bind with suitable fabrics/substrates. In the area of wastewater treatment, 
Remazol Black B is a well known surrogate for non-biodegradable reactive azo dyes 
(Pearce, 2004). Standard solutions of Remazol Black B were chosen as the target of 
the treatment of colour removal in this instance. Initial studies of the decoloration of 
solutions of Remazol Black B, involving the immobilised culture, Shewanella strain 
J 18 143, were conducted using cellulose-methacrylic acid copolymers as the support 
system. The procedures of immobilisation of the culture onto this supporting matrix 
were described in Section 2.1.3. 
3.2.1 Calibration curve of the solutions of Remazol Black B 
119 The calibration plot of the Remazol Black B dye solutions was made at known dye 
concentrations, as shown in Figure 3.2.1. The concentrations of the dye solutions 
were prepared at 0.01,0.02,0.03,0.05 and 0.06 g dm-3. Figure 3.2.1 is an example of 
a calibration curve for the dye solution of Remazol Black B that was constructed. A 
calibration curve was made every time a fresh Remazol Black B dye solution was 
made up.

The Lambert-Beer law was applied that describes the relationship between the 
absorbance value for the colorant in solution, the path length of the colorant solution 
and the concentration of colorant in solution:

experiments to give constant l values, the Beer-Lambert law may be expressed as 
follows:

It can be seen that the Lambert-Beer law applies to the calibration curve of the 
solutions of Remazol Black B, as indicated by the linear plot shown in Figure 3.2.1. 
This calibration plot can then be used to determine unknown concentrations of 
solutions containing the same colorant sample, after measurement of absorbance. 
3.2.2 Visual appraisal arising from the decoloration of the Remazol 
Black B solutions by the immobilised cells of Shewanella strain 
J18 143 
Investigations of colour removal of dye solutions of Remazol Black B, using 
cellulosic copolymers with immobilised bacterial cells, have been carried out 
following the procedures described in Section 2.2.4. Relative standards were 
established as controls for evaluating the effects of the decoloration of the dye 
solutions. The effects of the decoloration of the dye solutions and of the relative 
standards, by the immobilised cells were recorded photographically by digital camera 
means. 
The samples used in investigating the decoloration of Remazol Black B and the 
relative established standards were photographed, and are given as Figure 3.2.2.

122 In "Sample I", the vial contained the standard dye solution together with the 
immobilised cells. The cells were immobilised as "'growing-in" (Section 2.1.3.1) 
within the matrix of the cellulosic graft copolymer in the growth medium, i. e. if the 
cells had become attached, they were fixed/immobilised by the method of 
adsorption/entrapment. "Sample 2" contained the dye solution and the graft 
copolymer support linked via chemical coupling of the immobilised bacterial cells 
(Section 2.1.3.3). "Sample 3" contained the dye solution and the grafted cellulose 
with the physically adsorbed cells (Section 2.1.3.2). "Sample 4" represents the 
control of the standard dye solution that contained the sodium fomate and the AQDS 
without any addition of biological cells, as stated in Section 2.2.3.2. "Sample 5" was 
made up as the standard of the immobilised cells that contained the cellulosic graft 
copolymer immobilised cells, the sodium formate and the AQDS with the absence of 
the dye solution, as described in Section 2.2.3.1. 
All of the vials contained the Remazol Black B dye solution (50 AM), the electron 
donor solution of sodium formate (21 mM), the electron shuttle of solution of 
anthraquinone-2,6-disulphonic acid (AQDS, 100 AM) and a specified amount of 
phosphate buffer saline (P. B. S., 10 mM pH7) solution, as stated in Section 2.2.4. It 
can be seen from the images that the standard of the immobilised cells appeared a 
colour of yellow and was not colourless. The yellow coloration in the solution was 
supposed to be due to the presence of cytochromes in the solution. The cytochromes 
are more likely released by a certain amount of cell lysis that occurred during the 
treatment (Pearce, 2004) that was used in preparing the compositions. 
As can be seen from Figure 3.2.2, all of the samples treated with immobilised cells 
were decolorised to some degree. Comparing the decoloration results of "Samples" 
of 1,2 and 3 visually, the cells immobilised onto the grafted cellulose by the method 
of "growing-in" seem to provide a faster and more efficient method of colour 
removal. The colour of the sample that was placed with the cells that were 
immobilised by adsorption was not completely removed. The process of decoloration 
by the cells that were immobilised by coupling was slower than that obtained with 
123 the cells that were located by "growing-in" adsorption/entrapment. One problem 
needs to be recognised in that although these three immobilisation processes were 
undertaken with the same concentration of the cell suspension and the same amounts 
of grafted cellulose were used, the biomasses of the immobilised cells \vould be 
unlikely to have been identical, despite the precautions that were taken. This could 
explain the differences described above. It should be noted that, despite these 
differences, effective colour removal was observed. 
3.2.3 Results from the established standard controls 
As shown in Figure 3.2.2, the immobilised cells have a positive, desired effect on 
decoloration of the azo dye solutions. There are some factors that need to be 
considered with respect to the influence of each factor or component on the 
decoloration of the dye solution. Therefore, several controls, relating to the 
decoloration through the utilisation of immobilised cells, were established for 
interpreting the results obtained (Section 2.2.3). 
The established standards were named as, the immobilised cells standard, the dye 
solution standard, the cell growth medium standard, the grafted cellulose standard 
and the free cells standard. The photographic results from the dye solution standard 
(Sample 4) and the immobilised cells standard (Sample 5) were shown in Figure 
3.2.2. The photographic results of the rest of the established standards are given in 
the following sections. 
3.2.3.1 Standard of the cell growth medium solution 
The immobilisation of bacterial cells by the "growing-in" method (Section 2.3.1.1) 
was carried out by immersing the grafted cellulose samples, together with the cell 
culture, into cell growth medium. There could have been a small amount of residual 
T. S. B. solution in the sample, after washing. Thus, the influence, if any. of the T. S. B. 
on the decoloration of the dye solutions of Remazol Black B needed to be considered. 
124 "Sample 6" relates to the standard control of Tryptone Soy Broth (T. S. B. ) solution in 
which the composition is corresponding to the parallel control of "Sample 1" (see 
Section 3.2.1) as described in Section 2.2.3.1. The system contained the "treated" 
graft cellulosic copolymer (the graft cellulosic copolymer underwent the procedures 
of immobilisation of the method of "growing-in" with the absence of bacterial cells), 
Remazol Black B solution (50 µM), the electron donor solution of sodium formate 
(21 mM), the electron shuttle solution of anthraquinone-2,6-disulphonic acid (AQDS, 
100 µM) and a certain known amount of phosphate buffer saline (P. B. S., 10 mM 
pH7) solution. 
It can be concluded that the T. S. B. solution has no effect on the colour removal from 
the solutions of Remazol Black B, as seen from Figure 3.2.3. However, the tryptone 
soy broth is a very rich medium that can be used for growing a wide range of bacteria. 
Thus, strict aseptic environments for the experiments need to be applied with careful 
handling during the processes. These conditions were applied in the current work.

3.2.3.2 Standard of graft cellulosic copolymer 
A point needs to be considered as to whether or not the immobilisation substrate has 
effect on the decoloration of the Remazol Black B dye solution. This point was 
125 investigated by establishing the standard of graft cellulosic copolymer, as illustrated 
in Section 2.2.3.4.

"Sample 7" represents the grafted cellulose standard that contained the same amount 
of graft copolymer support as those samples represented in Figure 3.2.2, the Remazol 
Black B dye solution (50 µM), the electron donor solution of sodium formate (21 
mM), the electron shuttle solution of anthraquinone-2,6-disulphonic acid (AQDS, 
100 µM) and a certain known amount of phosphate buffer saline (P. B. S., 10 mM, 
pH7) solution. Figure 3.2.4 shows that the immobilisation substrate, 
cellulose-methacylic acid graft copolymer, has no influence on colour removal from 
the solution of Remazol Black B. 
3.2.3.3 Decoloration of solutions of Remazol Black B using free resting 
Shewnaella strain J18 143 cells 
The removal of colour from the Remazol Black B solutions using free resting cells of 
Sliewanella strain J18 143 has been well documented (Willmott, 1997; Kamilaki, 
2000; Pearce, 2004). The bacterial cells exhibited good ability in removing colour by 
degrading the chromophore of the dye. In qualifying the technique of using 
immobilised biological cells in decoloration of reactive dye solutions, free cells 
126 standards were established (Section 2.2.3.3). It should be noted from "Sample 8", 
that the reduction of the black dye solution was rapidly achieved by the free 
biological cells. Actually, the colour removal started before the nitrogen degassing 
was complete, as indicated in Figure 3.2.5.

8). Images of the standards that were taken after different periods of incubation (a) 10 seconds after 
injection of bacterial cells; (b) 5 minutes later; (b) 10 minutes later still. 
The decoloration of the dye solution with free cells was shown to be much faster than 
that which was achieved with the grafted cellulose immobilised cells. However, the 
"concentration" of the cells used for free cells standard was likely to be much greater 
than that used with the immobilised cells. The colour of the Remazol Black B dye 
solution was removed completely by the immobilised biological cells of Shewanella 
strain J 18 143, within 24 hours of incubation. This result has shown much potential 
in using the chemical modified cellulose as an immobilisation substrate in the 
decoloration systems. 
3.2.4 Measuring results from the decoloration of Remazol Black B 
solutions using immobilised cells 
All of the experiments were carried out in triplicate and were repeated at least three 
times. The results below here are average values. 
127 UV-visible spectophotometry (Section 2.5.3) was used as the main analysis support 
for evaluating the nature and the extent of decoloration of the dye solutions, as 
described in this section and also the following sections (Section 3.3 and Section 
3.4). 
3.2.4.1 Results from the decoloration of the of Remazol Black B solution using 
the "growing-in" immobilised cells 
The numerical results shown in Figure 3.2.6, which correspond to the "Sample 1" in 
Figure 3.2.2, show the absorbance versus time behaviour for the respective systems.

solution that contained the immobilised cells; "Sample 6" contained the standard solution of the 
growth medium of the bacterial colony; "Sample 7" contained the control of the cellulosic graft 
copolymer) 
All of the samples that contained the dye solution are at same concentration of the 
dye solution, i. e. the initial absorbance values of the samples ("Sample I", "Sample 
128 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 
Time (hour) 4", "Sample 6" and "Sample 7") are the same. However, "Sample I", "Sample 7" 
and "Sample 6" exhibited relatively lower concentrations of the dye in the free 
solution than that of the "Sample 4". This is possibly because these three samples 
contained pieces of cellulosic graft copolymer that might bring a tiny amount of 
aqueous medium into the vials when being transferred from their washing containers 
to the vials. This point needs to be taken into account also when considering the 
results shown in Figure 3.2.8 and in Figure 3.2.10. 
Figure 3.2.6 shows that the colour of the dye solution is removed completely within 
24 hours by the "growing-in" immobilised cells. This result is also indicated in 
Figure 3.2.2. Compared with the standard of the dye solution ("Sample 4"), the 
cellulosic graft copolymer ("Sample 7") and the growth medium of the bacteria 
("Sample 6") have no influence on the decoloration of the Remazol Black B dye 
solution. The corresponding UV-visible spectra to that of the Figure 3.2.6 are shown 
in Figure 3.2.7.

597 nm was completely removed after 24 hours of incubation with the biological 
cells of Shewanella strain J18 143. This is no doubt an indication of complete 
removal of colour from the treated dye containing system. Figure 3.2.7 only provided 
the spectra in the visible region, 400 nm - 700 nm. The UV region was investigated 
by Pearce (2004). A significant increase in absorbance in the UV region was found 
that corresponds to the reduction of the azo chromophore and the formation of 
aromatic amines. The aromatic amines were formed by the reduction of the 
azo/ketohydrazone bonds in the dye molecules.

method of chemical coupling, as described in Section 2.1.3.3. It can be seen from the 
Figure 3.2.8 that the removal of the colour was complete compared with that of the 
standard of the immobilised cells. However, the decoloration that occurred was 
relative slow compared with that of the "growing-in" immobilised cells. The 
complete decoloration took about 48 hours of incubation. As stated above, this 
relative slowness in the decoloration process was more likely to be due to the lower 
concentration of the immobilised biological cells that existed in the system.

However, there was still a significant peak in the visible region ('`24 hours"). This 
peak represented a hypsochromic shift in the spectrum as a result of a structural 
change in the dye molecule. The colour of the dye solution was removed completely 
after 48 hours of incubation with the coupled cells as seen from the spectrum in 
Figure 3.2.9 ("48 hours").

The UV-visible spectra for the Remazol Black B dye solution treated with 
immobilised Shewanella strain J18 143, by the immobilising method of physical 
adsorption, are shown in Figure 3.2.11. In the UV-visible spectra for the dye solution

Remazol Black B (597 nm) had been reduced. There were still significant peaks that 
can be seen in the visible region ("24 hours" and "48 hours" in Figure 3.2.11). These 
peaks represented a hypsochromic shift in the spectrum as a result of a structural 
change in the dye molecule and also represent the fact that the colour of the dye

133 3.2.4.4 Comparison of decoloration effect of the immobilised cells between the 
three immobilisation methods 
The results of this study have shown that the method of using grafted cellulose as a 
support for biological cells immobilisation is practicable and effective in the current 
context. Comparison of the decoloration results with those of the various samples 
with those of the two standards (shown in Figure 3.2.6, Figure 3.2.8 and Figure 
3.2.10), shows that the optical densities of the dye solution in "Sample 1" (the 
bacterial cells were immobilised by the method of "growing-in") were reduced very 
rapidly. The dye solution in "Sample 2" (the bacterial cells were immobilised by the 
method of chemical coupling) became decolorised relatively slowly. However the 
extent of decoloration eventually reached the same level as that of "Sample 1 ". The 
absorbance of the dye solution in "Sample 3" (the bacterial cells were immobilised 
by the method of adsorption) gave a poorer result, as shown in Figure 3.2.10. 
Comparisons of the decoloration efficiency for "Sample I", "Sample 2" and "Sample 
3" are given in Table 3.2.1 and Figure 3.2.12 below.

Figure 3.2.12 Comparison of the Effect of Colour Removal from Remazol Black B using 
Immobilised Cells based on the Three Different Immobilisation Methods ("Sample I", the cells 
used in decoloration were immobilised by the method of "growing-in"; "Sample 2", the cells were 
immobilised by coupling; "Sample 3", the cells were immobilised by adsorption. ) 
To provide the data given in Table 3.2.1, the dye decoloration rate was calculated 
from the measuring results for the first 24 hours of incubation, based on the results 
from the protein assay of immobilised cells (Figure 3.1.6 and Table 3.1.1). The 
bacteria concentration used under each immobilisation method was an averaged 
value. It can be seen from Table 3.2.1 that the cells immobilised by the method of 
"growing-in" provided the most decoloration as evaluated from both the dye 
reduction rate as seen in the protein assay studies and in the dye reduction as 
assessed by volumetric means. The cells immobilised by the method of adsorption, in 
the first 24 hours of incubation, show a higher reduction rate than that of the 
coupling immobilised cells. However, after 48 hours of incubation, the Remazol 
Black B was almost completely removed from the system by the cells that were 
immobilised by coupling but not by the cells immobilised by adsorption. One can 
conclude that all of the three different methods involving the immobilised cells gave 
colour removal of the Remazol Black B from the investigated dye solution systems. 
135 3.3 Colour reduction of metal-complex azo dye solutions 
using free cells of Shewanella strain J18 143 
In this section, the results obtained from the experimental work that «-as associated 
with the use of bacterial cells of the species Shewanella strain J18 143 to reduce 
aqueous solutions of selected metal-complex azo dyes are presented for discussion. 
Four metal-complex azo dyes, Irgalan Grey GLN, Irgalan Black RBLN, Irgalan Blue 
3GL and Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWL, were studied. The chemical structures of 
chromophores in these dyes were given in Section 2.3.1.1. 
3.3.1 Colour reduction of solutions of Irgalan Grey GLN using the 
free cells of Shewanella strain J18 143 
The Irgalan Grey GLN is a mixture of azo metal-complex dyes. It contains 70-80% 
of Irgalan Black RBLN and 5-10% of Irgalan Blue 3GL. The colour reduction of 
solutions of Irgalan Black RBLN and of Irgalan Blue 3GL was studied individually 
and ae considered in Section 3.3.2 and in Section 3.3.3. 
3.3.1.1 Calibration curve for solutions of Irgalan Grey GLN metal-complex 
dye 
To determine the dye reduction rate, calibration curves were prepared. This involved 
making dye solutions of the Irgalan Grey GLN metal-complex dye and then 
establishing the absorbance values at \max against known dye concentrations. The 
concentrations of the dye solutions were prepared at 0.0075,0.015,0.03,0.06 and 
0.12 g dm"3. The calibration traces provided a basis for confidence in the subsequent 
analytical assessments. 
The calibration curve shown in Figure 3.3.1 is one example of the various linear 
relationships that were established. The straight line plot indicates that the 
I ) 6 Lambert-Beer law applies to the dye solutions over this range of concentrations. This 
calibration curve was used to ascertain the actual amount of the dye that was reduced 
by the Shewanella strain J18 143 cells.

3.3.1.2 Visual results from the reduction of solutions of Irgalan Grey GLN 
metal-complex dye using the free cells of Shewanella strain J18 143 
The changes in colour of the samples were photographically recorded periodically as 
shown in Figure 3.3.2. Figure 3.3.2 consists of the images of the standard dye 
solution of the Irgalan Grey GLN metal-complex dye ("Sample 9", the final 
concentration of Irgalan Grey GLN in the sample was at 0.08 g dm-3), the solution of 
the Irgalan Grey GLN metal-complex dye ("Sample 10", the final concentration was 
at 0.08 g dm-3) being treated by the free cells of Shewanella stain J18 143 at different 
incubation periods and the standard suspension of the bacterial cells ("Sample 11 "). 
It can be seen from Figure 3.3.2 that the colour of the dye solution of Irgalan Grey 
GLN was reduced slowly relative to the corresponding decoloration of the Remazol 
Black B dye solution when using the same loading of the resting cells of the 
137 Shewanella strain J 18 143 (Figure 3.2.4). However, most of the colour reduction was 
completed within 24 hours of incubation. A small amount of coloured settlement was 
observed in "Sample 10" at the bottom the vials after an incubation period of 18 
hours. This is possible evidence for the fact that the dye molecule has been converted 
into less soluble particles. The colour of the dye solution was almost removed 
completely within 168 hours of incubation. It can be seen from Figure 3.3.2 that 
"Sample 9" was not a proper solution anymore after 72 hours of incubation. Some 
coloured precipitation was observed at the bottom of the vial. An investigation of 
these settlements was given and was discussed in Section 3.3.1.3.

3.3.1.3 Particle size investigation 
As mentioned in Section 3.3.1.2, a small amount of coloured settlement was 
observed at the bottom of the vials containing the standard Irgalan Grey GLN 
metal-complex dye solution that had been incubated for 72 hours at 30°C ("Sample 
9", Figure 3.3.2). The Irgalan Grey GLN contains sodium cations in its molecule. 
The dye could be precipitated out from the standard dye solution after a certain time 
138 r 
hours 10 
tnlnutes of incubation due to the interference by counter ions from the buffering solution 
(Broadbent, 2006, Personal communication). Thus, the settlement observed in the 
standard dye solution is from the reduced solubility of the by-products from the 
Irgalan Grey GLN. The particle size distribution from the particle analysis of the 
standard solution of Irgalan Grey GLN, after an incubation of 18 hours, is shown in 
Figure 3.3.3. The particles were detected across a wide range of size distributions, 
from 20 nm to 7000 nm. The volume content of the particles was up to 22%.

As also mentioned in Section 3.3.1.2, a small amount of a coloured, fluid "film" was 
observed at the bottom of the vials containing the dye solution that had been treated 
with cells after an incubation of 72 hours at 30°C ("Sample 10", Figure 3.3.2). The 
particle size analysis results are shown in Figure 3.3.4. The "particles" were 
distributed in size range of 35 nm to 65 nm (up to 5% in volume) and in size range of 
4500 nm to 7000 rim (up to 50% in volume). This size range is much less than those 
of the by-products of the standard dye solution.

Figure 3.3.5 Particle Size Distribution of Standard Cell Suspension of Shewanella Strain J18 143 
after 18 Hours of Incubation at 30°C 
Based on the particle analysis results shown in Figure 3.3.3 and in Figure 3.3.4, it 
was realised that analysis of the particle size of the standard cell suspension would be 
140 needed. The particle size distribution of the standard cell suspension (Sample 11), 
after an incubation of 18 hours at 30°C, is shown in Figure 3.3.5. The cell suspension 
shows a particle size distribution from 3000 nm to 7000 nm (up to 40% in volume). 
3.3.1.4 Measured results from the reduction of solutions of Irgalan Grey GLN 
using the free cells of Shewanella strain J18 143 
Analysis of the dye reduction products using UV-visible spectrophotometry (Figure 
3.3.6), as supported by photographic evidence (Figure 3.3.2), showed the colour 
changes that occurred as a consequence of the reduction treatment. The optical 
densities of the samples were measured for the incubation periods of 13 minutes, 22 
hours, 4 hours, 7 hours, 18 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours and 168 hours, as indicated 
(Section 2.3.3.2). The colour reduction of the solutions of Irgalan Grey GLN, at a 
concentration of 0.08 g dm-3, using the bacterial cells was carried out in triplicate 
each time and was investigated at least three times. The images shown in Figure 
3.3.2 represent examples of the studies carried out. The results shown in Figure 3.3.6 
are an example of the average of the findings arising from an investigation. 
The optical densities of "Sample 9", "Sample 10" and "Sample 11" were measured at 
X, ma,, of 577 nm, which is the maximum absorbance of the standard solution of Irgalan 
Grey GLN, as indicated in Figure 3.3.1. It should be noticed that the values of the 
absorbance of the "Sample 10" were increased at the beginning of the treatment 
instead of being decreased. It can be also seen that the standard of the cell suspension 
also makes a contribution to the absorbance. The increase in absorbance values of the 
"Sample 10" at the beginning of the study is assumed to be caused by the addition of 
the cell suspension. This was not observed in the previous sections of the study 
because, in those instances, the colour was removed too rapidly for one to be able to 
monitor any change caused by the addition of the cell suspension to the dye solution 
in the decoloration of the dye solution of the reactive azo dyes. Thus, a "corrected" 
relationship was established by subtracting the absorbance values of the standard of 
the cell suspension. This is presented as the "correction" line shown in Figure 3.3.7.

Time (Hour) As can be seen from Figure 3.3.7, the optical densities of the corrected values fell to 
the same level as that of the standard of the cell suspension. This finding supports the 
assumption that the increase in the absorbance, seen at the beginning, on adding the 
cells into the dye solution was caused by the cell suspension. In the UV-visible 
spectral region, the values of absorbance of the standard dye solution of Irgalan Grey 
GLN were measured, based on the reference of the corresponding buffering solution, 
while the absorbance of the cell-treated dye solutions was measured, based on the 
reference of the cell suspension standard, as mentioned in Section 2.2.3.1. As the cell 
suspension itself makes a contribution to the absorbance, the corrected curves give 
relative results so that comparisons of the colour changes can be made. 
In the UV-visible spectra for the dye solutions containing cells, measured after 18 
hours of incubation, the absorbance in the visible region at the , max for Irgalan Grey 
GLN (577 nm) was reduced (Figure 3.3.8). The lower line ("Grey dye with cells"), 
which represents the dye solution that was treated with the bacterial cells shown in 
Figure 3.3.8, has been corrected using the procedure mentioned above. The 
correction was done by subtracting the absorbance values arising from the standard 
cell suspension from those of the targeted sample.

Figure 3.3.8 UV-Visible Spectra for Solutions of Irgalan Grey GL\ after 18 Hours of 
Incubation, without and with Anaerobic Cell Suspension of Shewanella Strain J18 133, at 30°C 
143 It is clearly shown in Figure 3.3.8 that there was a reduction in absorbance by the dye 
solution. That is an indication of reduction in colour in conformity with the 
information mentioned in the Section 3.2.4.1. All of the results from the visual 
observation and from the data evaluation have shown that the colour of the the 
solution of the selected metal-complex azo dye, Irgalan Grey GLN. can be reduced 
by the resting cells of Shewanella strain J 18 143. This finding gives insight into the 
potential use of the bacterial cells of Shewanella strain J18 143 in the reduction of 
selected metal-complex azo dyes. 
The information provided by the manufacturer (Ciba Specialty Chemicals) of the 
Irgalan Grey GLN dye, states that the dye is a mixture of the chromophore of Irgalan 
Black RBLN and the chromophore of Irgalan Blue 3GL. For this reason, it was 
decided that further studies of the biological reduction of these two "parent" 
metal-complex dyes were needed. 
3.3.2 Colour reduction of solutions of Irgalan Black RBLN using 
the free cells of Shewanella strain J18 143 
Based on the results obtained from the colour reduction of dye solutions of Irgalan 
Grey GLN, the reduction of dye solutions of Irgalan Black RBLN was investigated 
and the results are discussed here. 
3.3.2.1 Calibration plot of the solutions of Irgalan Black RBLN 
The calibration plot of the solutions of Irgalan Black RBLN was assembled for 
calculating concentrations of the dye and for monitoring the reduction rate. The plot 
is displayed in Figure 3.3.9. A calibration plot was made each time when each new 
dye solution was being prepared. The known concentrations of the dy, e solutions 
were prepared at 0.04,0.048,0.064,0.08,0.104 and 0.12 g dm--'. This precaution w as 
taken to ensure that any changes in dye would be recognised.

It can be seen in Figure 3.3.9 that the Lambert-Beer law applies to the calibration 
plot of the Irgalan Black RBLN metal-complex azo dye solution, over the prepared 
range of dye concentrations, because of the linear relationship between the 
absorbance and the dye concentration. 
3.3.2.2 Visual results from the colour reduction of Irgalan Black RBLN dye 
solutions using the free cells of Shewanella strain J18 143 
The reduction of Irgalan Black RBLN, using free resting cells of Shewanella strain 
J18 143, was recorded photographically. Figure 3.3.10 displays the images of the 
standard dye solution of Irgalan Black RBLN (Sample 11), the dye solution having 
been treated with the bacterial cells (Sample 13) at different periods of incubation 
(10 minutes, 18 hours, 28 hours and 48 hours) and the standard suspension of free 
resting cells of Shewanella strain J18 143 (Sample 14).

the cell suspension standard) 
It can be observed from the images that the colour is reduced mostly within 28 hours. 
The colour was not removed completely in comparison with the standard of the cell 
suspension. Some coloured particles became suspended over the top of the evaluated 
solution sample surface. Settlement was found at the bottom of certain samples. For 
other reductions of the solutions of Irgalan Black RBLN, it was decided that 
anaerobic cuvettes would be used to provide the evaluated system with a less 
disturbed environment, both with respect to physical disturbance and with respect to 
the anaerobic conditions. To measure the absorbance of the samples (Section 2.3.4.2), 
-jl cm-3 of sample was transferred into disposable cuvettes using a sterile syringe 
with a sterile needle, for the measurement of the optical densities. This amount of 
sample was injected into its parent vial after measurement. There is no doubt that 
some oxygen could be transferred into the vial during such processes. Strict 
anaerobic conditions could then not be guaranteed. Furthermore, when the sample 
was transferred out of or injected into the system, the solution was disturbed. To 
reduce these possible factors, parallel experiments were prepared in sealed, anaerobic, 
quartz precision cuvettes (10 mm) as described in Section 2.3.4.2. The dye 
concentration in both of the evaluating systems was 0.08 g dm-3. The visual results 
are displayed in Figure 3.3.11.

The corresponding measured results relevant to the images shown in Figure 3.3.10 
("Sample 12", "Sample 13" and "Sample 14") that were analysed by UV-Visible 
spectroscopy are shown in Figure 3.3.12. The measurements were taken after the 
samples had been incubated, at 30°C, for 10 minutes, 28 minutes, 96 minutes, 186 
minutes, 248 minutes and 1493 minutes respectively. It is important to notice that the 
optical densities of "Sample 12" and of "Sample 14" were measured, based on 
references of the phosphate buffer saline solution (P. B. S. ). The optical densities of 
147 "Sample 13" were measured on the basis of the reference of the standard of the cell 
suspension (Sample 14). This point is also raised in Section 3.3.3.2 in that the cell 
suspension itself makes a contribution to the absorbance values.

decrease linearly. The optical densities were measured at 248 minutes after the 
addition of the bacterial cells and 1493 minutes after such addition. There was a gap 
of about 20 hours due to limitations in accessing to the experimental area. The trend 
of the curves of "Sample 13" in Figure 3.3.12 will not fully represent the full 
tendency in colour reduction. The value of each point in the figure is the real

The spectrum of the standard solution of Irgalan Black RBLN and that of the cell 
treated dye solution after an incubation of 24 hours are displayed in Figure 3.3.13. It 
can be seen that the absorbance at the X'max of the dye solution of Irgalan Black 
RBLN (the curve of the dye solution standard) dropped to a lower level (the curve of 
the dye solution with cells). This is no doubt strong support for the reduction of the 
colour intensity.

free cells of Shewanella strain J18 143 
The results from the biological reduction of solutions of Irgalan Blue 3GL are given 
and discussed in this section. 
3.3.3.1 Calibration plot of the solutions of Irgalan Blue 3GL 
The calibration plot of solutions of Irgalan Blue 3GL was assembled to be used in 
calculating the concentration of dye and the reduction rates, as described in later 
149 sections. The plot is displayed in Figure 3.3.14. A new calibration curve was made 
each time a new dye solution being prepared. The optical densities were measured at 
for known loading of the dye solutions of 0.02,0.03,0.05,0.07,0.09 and 0.12 z

respectively, with anaerobic resting cell suspension of Shewanella strain J 18 143 at 30°C; "Sample 
17" presents the cell suspension standard) 
It can be seen from the Figure 3.3.15 that the colour of the dye solution changed to 
green within ten minutes, after the addition of cell suspension (image taken of "10 
minutes later"). The colour of the dye solution was then further reduced to a reduced 
intensity. The image of "18 hours later" shows a settlement of coloured particles at 
the bottom of the vial and some coloured material over the top of the liquid system. 
A coloured film-like "biomass" also developed at the bottom of the vial. The image 
corresponding to the dye solution that had been treated for 28 hours did not show a 
clear settlement in the vial. This may be due to the shaking of the sample before 
taking the photograph. 
As employed in the experiments used in the reduction of solutions of Irgalan Black 
RBLN, stricter, anaerobic and more stable conditions were used for the reduction of 
Irgalan Blue 3GL (Figure 3.3.16). The samples were prepared at the same 
concentrations as that of the samples shown in Figure 3.3.15. 
Four cuvettes were prepared for the investigation. Two of the cuvettes contained the 
standard solution of Irgalan Blue 3GL (0.08 g dm-3). Two others contained the same 
concentration of the dye solution with the addition of the bacterial cell suspension. In 
151 Dye wita loll 
standard Figure 3.3.16, the left hand side two cuvettes represent the image of the standard dye 
solution after an incubation of 18 hours. The difference between these two samples 
in each set of two (left hand side and right hand side) is that the second left sample 
was shook before the photograph was taken while the first left sample was not 
shaken. The right hand side two cuvettes contained the dye solution and the bacterial 
cells. The left one was shook before being taken the photograph while the right 
sample was not. There is no difference in the pairs of images displayed in Figure 
3.3.15. The measured samples were taken from the vials using a syringe/needle 
combination for the measurement using LTV-Visible spectro- photometry. All of the 
samples were shaken well before taking such measurements. The image of the dye 
solution standard is shown in Figure 3.3.15, taken 10 minutes after the preparation. 
Here, no settlement can be seen.

respectively. The optical densities of "Sample 15" and of "Sample 17" were 
measured, based on references of the phosphate buffer saline solution (P. B. S. ). The 
optical densities of solutions relating to "Sample 16" were measured based with 
respect to the reference of the standard of the cell suspension (Sample 17). All of the 
absorbance values were measured after shaking the vials.

to lower different wavelength, indicating that a change in colour had happened. The 
absorbance of the dye solution with cells fell to such extent that the evidence for 
reduction of colour of the treated solution is clearly seen. 
3.3.4 Colour reduction of solutions of Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWL 
using the free cells of Shewanella strain J18 143 
Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWL is a metal-complex azo dye that was studied, for any 
colour reduction that might occur, using the Shewwanella strain J 18 143. The chemical 
structure of this yellow dye was given in Section 2.3.1.1 (Figure 2.3.3). The 
experimental results from the reduction of solutions of Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWL are 
given here and are discussed in this section.

A calibration plot of the solutions of Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWL (Figure 3.3.19) was 
prepared for the determination of concentrations of the dye and for the calculation of 
reduction rates, as considered in later sections. This calibration was made by, 
measuring the optical densities at ? of known concentrations of the dye solutions 
at 0.0075,0.015,0.03,0.06 and 0.09 g dm-3 respectively.

Figure 3.3.20 displays the images of the standard of the dye solution (Sample 18), of 
the dye solution with existing of the bacterial cells (Sample 19) and those of the 
standard cell suspension (Sample 20). All of the images shown in Figure 3.3.20 were 
taken without any prior shaking of the samples. As shown in Figure 3.3.20, some 
particles arising from what was the standard yellow dye solution precipitated to the 
bottom of the evaluating system. The images of the standard dye solution were taken 
at different incubation periods and are shown in Figure 3.3.20. Only a slight change 
can be seen in the images of the dye solutions that were treated with the biological 
cells. One difference that can be recognised from these images is that for the standard 
dye solutions no precipitation was produced during the incubation period.

KWL using the free cells of Shewanella strain J18 143 
Analysis of the dye reduction using UV-visible spectrophotometry (Figure 3.3.21), 
gives information that supports the photographic evidence (Figure 3.3.20). 
All of the measurements were taken after shaking the samples in their vial. The 
absorbance values (with respect to time) of the standard dye solution (Sample 18) 
and those of the cell suspension (Sample 20) did not change with time. The optical 
densities of the dye solution with the bacterial cells, decreased from the original 
value (at time zero). The initial concentration (0.12 g dm--') in the standard dye 
solution and in the dye solution with bacterial cells was the same. The instant 
increase in the absorbance was caused by the addition of the cells suspension to the 
dye solution. 
A correction plot was assembled, as shown in Figure 3.3.22, taking into account the 
effect of the biological cells.

In Figure 3.3.22, the "correction" line represents the corrected results for the dye 
reduction study, obtained by subtracting the optical densities contributed by the cell 
suspension from those of the treated dye solution. It can be seen that there was some 
reduction in optical densities of the biological treated dye solutions, but this was not 
as significant as the reductions previously mentioned for the solutions of the other 
three Irgalan dyes. 
In the UV-visible spectral region, the absorbance of the Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWL 
dye solution standards was measured based on the reference of corresponding 
buffering solution. Also, the absorbance of the cell-treated dye solutions was 
measured, based on the reference of the cell suspension standard, as mentioned in 
Section 2.2.3.1. As the cell suspension itself makes a contribution to the absorbance, 
the corrected curve gives relative results for comparisons of the colour changes. In 
the UV-visible spectra of the dye solutions that contained cells, after 18 hours of 
158 incubation (Figure 3.3.23), the absorbance in the visible region at the a, for the dye 
solution of the Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWL (456 nm) is clearly reduced, if not 
dramatically.

As can be seen from Figure 3.3.20, a small amount of a coloured "film" was 
observed at the bottom of the vials of the Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWL solution which 
contained the cell suspension of Shewanella strain J 18 143. Particle size analysis was 
carried out to evaluate the reduction systems containing Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWL 
dye solutions. No evidence of "coloured film" formation was seen in vials containing 
only a solution of the dye. Particle size analysis was carried out on the solutions of 
Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWL and its biological treated form.

after 18 Hours of Incubation at 30°C 
Figure 3.3.24 displays the particle size distribution of the standard cell suspension, 
after an incubation period of 18 hours at 30°C. It can be seen that the cells that were 
suspended in the systems gave a size distribution from 3000 nm to 7000 nm with 
160 volume content up to 40%. The results from the particle size analysis of the standard 
dye solution of Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWL, which was incubated at 30°C for 18 hours, 
are shown in Figure 3.3.25. "Particles" were detected with a size up to 2 rim and a 
"volume" up to 40%. The relevant images are shown in Figure 3.3.20. 
The results from the particle analysis of the Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWL dye solution, 
which after 18 hours of incubation with the bacterial cells of Shetivarnella strain J18 
143, are shown in Figure 3.3.26. Comparing the size distribution of the standard cell 
suspension (3000 nm - 7000 nm) with that of the standard dye solution (up to 2 nm), 
the particle size range detected from the biological treated dye solution was greater, 
range from 500 nm to 7000 nm. This agrees the precipitation behaviour shown in 
Figure 3.3.20. Further more, the volume content of the detected particles was 
reduced in the biologically treated dye solutions. It is possible that the dye molecules 
became aggregated among the cells. Thus, the dye molecules became adsorbed onto 
the biomass.

161 3.4 Factors affecting the reduction of solutions of 
metal-complex azo dyes using free resting cells of 
Shewanella strain J18 143 
The factors that may affect the decoloration of the solutions of reactive azo dyes 
using the whole cells of Shewanella strain J18 143 have been documented by Pearce 
(2004). These factors include oxygen, temperature, pH, the colorant concentration, 
the colorant structure, any colorant hydrolysis, the role of electron donors, the role of 
the electron shuttles, and the presence of alternative electron acceptors. The 
experimental conditions set up for the current study was the same as those used by 
Pearce (2004). A more limited study of the effects of the colorant concentration, 
temperature and pH on the reduction of the solutions of metal-complex azo dyes was 
carried out (Section 2.4). The other parameters used were those specified by Pearce 
(2004). The results from the experimental work undertaken are given and are 
discussed in this section. 
3.4.1 Protein assay 
Protein analysis using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay kit was employed for the 
samples of resting cell suspension that had been taken from each microbial 
experiment (Section 2.4.2 and Section 2.5.5.2). The amount of biomass that was 
implicated in the reduction of the solutions of the metal-complex azo dyes, in each 
microbial reduction experiment, was calculated from these protein analysis results, 
using the standard Bovine Serum Albumin protein analysis calibration curve (Figure 
3.4.1). 
Figure 3.4.1 gives one example of the calibration curves that were assembled. The 
calibration curve was made each time before the dye reduction treatment was 
commenced. The reduction of the dye solutions by Sheit'anella strain J18 143 cells 
162 was then expressed as a rate, this being the concentration of dye solution reduced per 
gram of biomass per minute.

using free resting cells of Shewanella strain J18 143 
The factors of the dye concentration, the temperature and the pH are considered in 
this section on the study of the colour reduction of Irgalan Grey GLN solutions. 
3.4.2.1 Effect of dye concentration on the dye reduction 
The concentration of dye in the system can influence the efficiency of the 
biologically induced reduction through a combination of factors, including the 
possible toxicity of the dye at higher concentrations and the ability of enzymic 
system to recognise the dye substrate efficiently at very low concentrations (Pearce, 
2004). The effect of solutions of the Irgalan Grey GLN dye concentration on the di e 
reduction efficiency is clearly shown in Figure 3.4.2.

Figure 3.4.3 Effect of Concentration on the Rate of the Irgalan Grey GLN Dye Reduction in 
Solution using a Resting Cell Suspension of Shewanella Strain J18 143 
Figure 3.4.2 shows that the bacterial cells of Shewanella strain J18 143 performed 
effective dye reduction at all of the dye concentrations considered. The rate of the 
reduction of the dye solutions at each concentration was calculated using the 
164 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 
Dye Concentration in assay (g/dm3) appropriate calibration curve (Figure 3.4.1). The reduction rate was expressed as 
mg/dm -3/g biomass/min. Figure 3.4.3 gives the reduction rate for the reduction of 
Irgalan Grey GLN solutions against the dye concentration of the evaluated systems. 
It can be seen that the reduction rate increases as the dye concentration increases. 
This provides a clear relationship of between the dye reduction rate and the dye 
concentration. However, one should not assume that this relation would apply over 
all concentrations. The implication for industrial dye effluents is that, unless specific 
further calibrations are undertaken, for higher concentration of dye, the effluent 
would need to be "balanced" to bring its concentration with the limits specified by 
the current study. 
3.4.2.2 Effect of temperature on dye reduction 
To investigate the effect of temperature on dye reduction, washed anaerobic cells of 
Shewanella strain J 18 143 were challenged with solutions of Irgalan Grey GLN (0.12 
g dm-3) at pH 6.8, over a range of temperatures from 22°C to 60°C (Section 2.4.4). 
The change in absorbance at the max of the dye solutions is shown in Figure 3.4.4.

capable of reducing the colour of the dye solutions over quite a wide range of 
temperatures. This effect is, perhaps, more clearly demonstrated in Figure 3.4.5.

Figure 3.4.5 Effect of Temperature on the Rate of Irgalan Grey GLN Dye Reduction in Solution 
using a Resting Cell Suspension of Shewanella Strain J18 143 
The rate of reduction of the dye solutions by the biomass was calculated. Data 
concerning of dye reduction rate versus temperature are shown in Figure 3.4.5. For 
the reduction of Irgalan Grey GLN, the optimal temperature was around 50°C. The 
results indicate that the reduction process does not require a particular temperature. 
This is of relevance as the textile industries normally discharge wastewaters at a 
temperature that is around 40°C (Section 1.2.4). However, considering the 
temperature requirement of the bacterial cells, Shewanella strain J18 143, over a long 
period of treatment, 30°C was chosen as the incubation temperature for the rest of the 
dye reduction evaluations. 
3.4.2.3 Effect of pH on dye reduction

Shewanella strain J18 143 were challenged with solutions of Irgalan Grey GLN at

pH in assay As can be seen from Figure 3.4.6, almost no dye reduction occurred at pH 4.4. A 
significant dye reduction rate occurs at pH 5.6. The results in Figure 3.4.7 show that 
the bacterial cells of Shewanella strain J18 143 can decolorise the dye solutions of 
Irgalan Grey GLN at pH values up to 9.2. The optimal conditions for reduction using 
Shewanella strain J18 143 were at higher pH values, as found in the literature 
(Willmott, 1997; Pearce, 2004). In the research, pH 7 was chosen as the pH condition 
for the study of the reduction of the Irgalan Grey GLN dye solutions.

168 The effect of the concentration of the Irgalan Black RBLN solution on the dye 
reduction was investigated. The results are shown in Figure 3. -4.8. 
It can be seen from Figure 3.4.8 that the biological cells of Shewanella strain J1 8 14) 
are capable of reducing the colour of the dye solution over the considered 
concentration range. The reduction rate was calculated based on the standard protein 
assay and the calibration plot of the Irgalan Black RBLN solutions. The reduction 
rate was expressed as mg/dm -3/g biomass/min. Figure 3.4.9 gives the reduction rate 
for the reduction of Irgalan Black RBLN solutions against the dye concentration of 
the evaluated systems. The reduction rate increases as the dye concentration

rate of the colour reduction of the dye solutions of Irgalan Black RBLN is shown in

50°C. This result is the same as found from the colour reduction of the Irgalan Grey 
GLN solutions. 
3.4.3.3 Effect of pH on dye reduction 
The effect of the pH on the colour reduction of Irgalan Black RBLN was evaluated. 
This was carried by preparing a range of buffers to produce a pH range of 4.4 to 9.2 
(Section 2.4.1). The results are shown in Figure 3.4.12. The colour of the solutions of 
Irgalan Black RBLN could not be reduced at pH 4.4. The bacterial cells have shown 
the ability of reducing the colour from the solutions of Irgalan Black RBLN, from pH 
5.6 to pH 9.2.

Time (hour) Figure 3.4.14 shows that the free resting cells of Shewanella strain J18 143 provided 
colour reduction of the dye solutions of Irgalan Blue 3GL over the dye concentration 
range from 0.04 g dm-3 to 0.18 g dm"3. The reduction rate at each concentration was 
calculated. The reduction rates against the corresponding dye concentrations are 
plotted in Figure 3.4.15. The results obtained are similar to those of the Irgalan Grey 
GLN and of Irgalan Black RBLN. The reduction rate increases as the dye 
concentration increases over the tested dye concentration range. 
3.4.4.2 Effect of temperature on dye reduction 
The effect of the temperature on the colour reduction of the solutions of Irgalan Blue 
3GL was investigated. The results are displayed in Figure 3.4.16. It can be seen that 
the bacterial cells are able to reduce the colour from solutions of Irgalan Blue 3GL at 
the tested temperature range, 22°C to 60°C. This result obtained is the same as that of 
the colour reduction of Irgalan Grey GLN and of Irgalan Blue 3GL.

The effect of pH on the colour reduction of solutions of Irgalan Blue 3GL using free

buffer solution ranged from pH 4.4 to pH 9.2 as shown in Table 2.4.1. The results are 
shown in Figure 3.4.18. 
It can be seen that the bacterial cells can perform colour reduction between pH 5.6 to 
pH 9.2, but not at pH 4.4. The reduction rate of the colour reduction at each pH was 
constructed against the corresponding pH values (Figure 3.4.19). The bacterial cells 
give more effective colour reduction results from pH 7 to pH 9. 
It can be seen that the results obtained, from the investigation of the effect of the dye 
concentration, the temperature and the pH on the colour reduction of Irgalan Blue 
175 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 3GL200%, were the same as those of the Irgalan Grey GLN and Irgalan Black

pH in assay 3.4.5 Factors affecting the reduction of Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWWT 
solutions using free resting cells of Shewanella strain J18 143 
Although the reduction of Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWL using free bacterial cells of 
Shewanella strain J18 143 under the conditions chosen was not significant in a total 
effluent treatment context (Section 3.3.4), the factors affecting the reduction of the 
dye solution under such conditions were investigated (Section2.3.3). Attempts were 
made to optimise the reduction system to obtain a more satisfactory reduction 
environment. 
3.4.5.1 Effect of dye concentration on dye reduction 
The effect of the concentration of Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWL on the dye reduction 
process was investigated. The results are presented in Figure 3.4.20.

Figure 3.4.21 Effect of Concentration on the Rate of Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWL Dye Reduction 
in Solution using Resting Cell Suspension of Shewanella Strain J18 143 
The dye reduction rate in the reduction of Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWL was calculated 
using the standard calibration curve (Figure3.4.1). The dye reduction rate was 
expressed in units of mg/dm3/g biomass/min. The dye reduction rates relative to the 
dye concentration in the reaction systems were drawn and are given in Figure 3.4.21. 
Irgalan Yellow dye reduction showed an optimum rate response with respect to the 
initial concentration of dye, at a value of approximately 0.12 g dm--'. At greater 
concentrations, the initial absorbance reduction rate decreases with increasing dye 
concentration. This is possibly due to toxic effects of the dye on the micro-organisms. 
Thus, the dye concentration, in the reduction system, of 0.12 g dm -3 was chosen as 
the optimum condition. 
178 3.4.5.2 Effect of temperature on dye reduction 
The effect of the system temperature on the reduction of Irgalan Yellow 3RL KNVL 
was investigated. The results are shown in Figure 3.4.22. The temperature range 
covered from 22° C to 60° C.

179 Figure 3.4.22 shows that the bacterial cells of Shewanella strain J18 143 are capable 
of reducing the dye solutions over a range of temperatures. The dye reduction rate 
against the temperature was plotted as shown in Figure 3.4.23. An optimum in the 
reaction temperature was at around 40° C. 
3.4.5.3 Effect of pH on dye reduction 
The effect of pH of the assay on the dye reduction was investigated. The results are 
shown in Figure 3.4.24. The pH values of the evaluated systems were prepared 
ranging from pH 4.4 to pH 9.2. 
It can be seen in Figure 3.4.24 that the dye reduction is not favourable to the bacterial 
cells of Shewanella strain J 18 143 at pH 4.4. The corresponding dye reduction rate 
against system pH was drawn in Figure 3.4.25. It can be found in Figure 3.4.25 that 
there was no dye reduction occurred at pH 4.4. The bacterial cells gave better dye 
reduction between pH 6 to pH 8. The reduction rate was decreased when the pH of 
the evaluating system increased from pH 8 to pH 9. Therefore, colour reduction at 
pH 7 is a practicable option.

Figure 3.4.25 Effect of pH Conditions on the Rate of Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWL Dye Reduction

From the results shown in the investigation of the factors may affect the dye 
reduction of Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWL using free cells of Shewanella strain J 18 143, 
an optimum dye reduction can be determined regarding the factors of dye 
concentration, system temperature and system pH. That is, under the condition of 
using the same concentration of the bacterial cells as the evaluating systems, the 
optimum conditions to be used were a dye concentration of 0.12 g dm-3, at 40° C' and 
pH 7 in the system.

pH in assay 4 General discussion 
The colour removal studies were carried out with two objectives. One was the 
decoloration of Remazol Black B using bacterial cells that were immobilised on 
cellulosic graft copolymeric substrates. Another was the reduction in colour of 
selected metal-complex azo dyes using planktonic bacterial cells. The bacterial cells 
used throughout the work were from the Shewanella strain J18 143'. This is a 
facultative bacterium that has been reported to decolorise successfully a range of 
reactive dyes and pigments that contain azo groups (Willmott, 1997; Kamilaki, 2000; 
Pearce, 2004). 
4.1 Studies involving colour removal from Remazol Black 
B solutions using immobilised cells 
In part of the study, whole cells of Shewanella strain J 18 143 were immobilised onto 
modified cellulose, graft copolymeric substrates. The composites of bacteria- 
cellulosic copolymer were viable and active with respect to the decoloration of the 
Remazol Black B. A number of researchers have reported that immobilised cells can 
be employed for providing process intensification in wastewater treatment (Section 
1.5.2). However, it should be noted that various factors need to be considered 
including the stability of the immobilised bacterial cells, the activity of the 
immobilised bacterial cells in aspect of decoloration. the reusability of the 
immobilised system and the biodegradation of the supporting backbone polymer. 
Cost and practicality factors are also of relevance. 
Preliminary work was undertaken on the immobilisation of the bacterial cells. 
Sheivanc'lla strain J 18 143. on to a graft cellulosic copolymer substrate. The purpose 
of the work was to develop a suitable biosupport in the biological decoloration of 
reactive azo dyes. This suitability was based on factors such as biocompatibility*. 
182 accessibility and ease of removal of the by-products of the breakdown. Clearly the 
copolymer can be influential in other ways (provision of a more gentle 
microenvironment, localised pH features and so on. 
The immobilisation substrate, cellulose-MAA graft copolymer. was firstly prepared. 
The grafting yield of the graft copolymer used was averaged at 5.5%. The grafting 
yield of the prepared graft copolymer was deliberately kept low. This was designed 
to maintain the fibrous nature of the substrate and to create a balanced p1-i 
environment for the bacterial cells to be immobilised. The grafting of the monomer 
of methacrylic acid onto the cotton fabrics were proved by SEM analysis. 
Representative images are shown in Figure 3.1.2. This grafting event and extent «was 
further proved by the titrimetric analysis of the graft copolymer. The -COON 
existing on the graft copolymer was titrated as a concentration of 0.1+0.01 mol dm-3. 
The bacterial cells of Shewanella strain J18 143 were immobilised onto the 
cellulose-MAA graft copolymer by three different methods, as described in Section 
2.1.3. The methods used were of "growing-in", physical adsorption and chemical 
coupling. The immobilisation methods were applied by different mechanism as 
introduced in Section 1.5.1. The effect of colour removal from solutions of Remazol 
Black B using these three methods was compared among selected methods 
(Figure3.2.12) and with the use of the planktonic cells (Figure3.2.6). The 
decoloration of Remazol Black B solution using the planktonic cells was much faster 
than that achieved using the immobilised cells. This indicates that accessibility is a 
feature. This point is supported by the calculated reduction rates, using the 
immobilised cells in the removal of colour of Remazol Black B solutions, as shown 
that the bacterial cells in Table 3.2.1. The images given in Figure 3.2.2 show 
immobilised by the method of "growing-in" provided a faster and more complete 
decoloration extent among the three studied immobilisation methods. However. as 
shown in the Table 3.1.1, the amount of the bacterial cells presented in each 
individual decoloration system was different. Accessibility is, again, indicated as 
being an important feature. The reduction rates, calculated from protein assays and 
18) the reduction calculated from analytic means, were employed (Table 3.2.1) 
Although the planktonic cells gave faster decoloration than that of the immobilised 
cells, the reduction rate of the cells immobilised by the method of "growing-in" [66.0 
pM dye g"1 (biomass) min-'] was at a similar level to that given by the planktonic 
cells, as indicated from a comparison with the results shown in Pearce's work (2004). 
It can be concluded that the activity of the immobilised bacterial cells of Shetivalli'lla 
strain J18 143 was maintained. There is no doubt that the stability and the reusability 
of the bacterial cells in application in the decoloration system are improved. The 
cells immobilised by the method of adsorption and coupling showed lower reduction 
rates than those given by the two other methods. 
All of the three studied immobilisation methods were applied successfully in the 
removal of colour from the Remazol Black B solutions. The Remazol Black B was 
almost completely removed using the immobilised cells by the method of 
"growing-in" (97.7%) and by the method of chemical coupling (96.4%), after 48 
hours of treatment. The bacterial cells immobilised by the method of adsorption 
provided a colour removal of 72.1 % after 48 hours of incubation. These differences 
in the decoloration effeciencies are mainly brought by the stabilities of the bacterial 
cells that being immobilised by the three different methods. The stability of the 
bacterial cells, that being immobilised by the method of "growing-in', is proved 
higher than that provided by the other two methods. 
The systems are successful with respect to the objective of effective colour removal. 
The use of the immobilised cells provides many advantages in the application in 
decoloration. The immobilised bacterial cells can be used in a continuous system 
effectively and the control of the decoloration system is much easier, since the 
stability and the reusability of the bacterial cells are improved. The impact of this 
approach in the use of the immobilised cells can be seen in two aspects of this work. 
One is that the activity of the bacterial cells may be inhibited. This observation has 
been intimated in previous research (Juang et al., 2002. Peralta-Zamora et al., 200"). 
Lu et al., 2007). Another impact concerned the quantity of the bacterial cells that 
184 were immobilised onto the biosupport. In another words, although the concentration 
of the bacterial cells existing in the decoloration systems «was relatively low the 
system was effective. However, the selection of the biosupport, and/or the 
modification of the cellulose may need to be improved. 
As stated above, the cellulosic copolymer with its grafted hydroxyl groups has been 
proved to be suitable as a biosupport for the immobilisation of biological cells. 
Therefore, the cellulose may need to be modified on the basis of accessibility and the 
suitability of the microenvironment provided by the copolymeric matrix. The 
cellulose-MAA copolymer shows potential in use as immobilisation substrate for the 
bacterial cells of Shewanella strain J18 143. Optimisation of the immobilisation 
system needs to be considered. Such optimisation options include the selection of the 
monomer, factors relating to the grafting yield, to the homogeneity of grafting and to 
the length of the grafted chains. Also, optimisation of the immobilisation methods 
will be needed following such changes. 
4.2 Colour reduction of solutions of metal-complex azo 
dyes using the planktonic cells 
The reduction in the colour of solutions of the metal-complex azo dyes. using 
planktonic bacterial cells of Shewanella strain J18 143, was another major aim in this 
study. The removal of colour from aqueous solutions of the Irgalan Grey GLN. of 
Irgalan Black RBLN and of Irgalan Blue 3GL was achieved successfully. However, 
the colour reduction of Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWL was not/less achieved. 
Irgalan Grey GLN solutions are toxic to aquatic organisms if the solutions are run 
directly to surface waters. Irgalan Grey GLN is a metal-complex azo dye that 
contains cobalt ions and chromium ions in the organo-metal complex. Irgalan Grey 
GLN has been recognised as being not readily biodegradable (Ciba Specialty 
Chemicals Safety Data Sheet). The reduction in colour of Irgalan Grey GLN aqucuus 
185 solutions (0.08 g dm-3 in the final treatment system) using planktonic cells was 
successful. 91.5% of colour was removed from the dye solution. The by-products 
from the biological degradation of the dye were not soluble in the buffering solution. 
and were found as a precipitate at the bottom of the vials that comprised the 
evaluation system. Some precipitation was also found in the standard dy. e solution of 
Irgalan Black B in the buffer. Particle size analysis was carried out on these 
precipitate/suspensions. The standard dye solutions gave particle size values' 
distributions from 20 nm to 7000 nm, after 18 hours of incubation. The planktonic 
cell suspension standards have a size distribution from 3000 nm to 7000 nm. The 
biological cells-treated systems have a size distribution from 35 nm to 65 nm and 
from 4500 to 7000nm. These observations are in an agreement with the results 
shown in Figure 3.3.2. The by-products of the biological degradation of Irgalan Grey 
GLN were not identified. Further study on the by-products of Irgalan Grey GLN 
reduction is recommended for optimisation of the decoloration of metal-complex azo 
dyes. Clearly the precipitated forms are in a largely energetic state. In reducing this 
energetic character, precipitation occurs. 
Irgalan Grey GLN is a mix of two metal-complex azo dyes, Irgalan Black RBLN and 
Irgalan Blue 3GL. Irgalan Black RBLN solutions are also recognised as being toxic 
to aquatic organisms if run directly to surface waters. This system is not recognised 
as being readily biodegradable (Ciba Specialty Chemicals Safety Data Sheet). Irgalan 
Blue 3GL solutions are poorly eliminated by adsorption in effluent treatment sludge 
systems and are harmful to aquatic organisms if run directly to surface waters. 
Colour reduction of these two dye solution systems was undertaken. The results 
observed from the colour reduction studies based on these two dyes were similar to 
those observed in the study of the colour reduction of Irgalan Grey' GLN solutions. 
76.8% and 76.2% of colour was removed from the solutions of Irgalan Black RBLN 
and Irgalan Blue 3GL respectively, using the bacterial cells of Sheivanella strain J 18 
143. It would appear that the systems are able to tolerate the presence of the central 
metal cation to a reasonable degree. 
186 Irgalan Yellow 3RL KWL aqueous solutions are identified as being toxic to aquatic 
organisms if run directly to surface waters. The colour of Irgalan Yellow 3RL K'A'L 
dye solutions can be partially eliminated by adsorption on an effluent sludge (Ciba 
Specialty Chemicals Safety Data Sheet). Colour reduction of Irgalan Y llo« )RI. 
KWL solutions was carried out. However, the dye solution was not fully decolorised 
using the bacterial cells. 10.5% of colour loss was found. Kandelbauer et al. (2004) 
studied the decoloration of Irgalan Yellow 2GL solutions and Irgalan Yellow '-GI 
solutions using free laccase, 12% and 9% of colour loss were achieved respectively. 
The reason of the smaller extent in colour reduction of Irgalan Yellow 3RL h \V I. 
have not been identified due to the time and the facility limitations. It is possible that 
further optimisation of the biological degradation process could lead to a situation 
where more effective and efficient colorant breakdown could be achieved (nutrient 
medium, concentration variations, cell loading). 
The mechanism of colour reduction of Remazol Black B azo dye solutions using 
planktonic cells of Shewanella strain J18 143 was suggested by Pearce (2004), and 
shown in Figure 4.2.1. 
Complete colour removal from Remazol Black B solution was achieved using the 
planktonic bacterial cells (Willmott, 1997; Pearce, 2004). The mechanism of the 
colour reduction of metal-complex azo dyes was considered. It is clear that the 
colour process is a very complicated matter and requires investigation throughout of 
the biological reduction procedures and of the reduction by-products. Willmott (1997) 
demonstrated that extracellular enzymes were not involved in the removal of colour 
from Remazol Black B solution. Shewanella putrefaciens cells have the ability to 
utilise some minerals, such as U (IV) and Fe (III), as the terminal electron acceptor 
(Section 1.4.3). From the results obtained relating to the reduction of solutions of the 
Irgalan series of dyes, some of the metal-complex azo dyes can be assumed to be 
acting as electron acceptors. Limitations in the extent of colour reduction of the 
aqueous dye solutions were found in this work. The metal complex Irgalan Yellow 
3RL KWL was not successful reduced. Clearly the nature of the continuous medium 
187 (aqueous system) can be a theme for further investigation as can aspects of dye 
aggregation phenomena.

4.3 Investigation of the factors affecting the biological 
colour reduction of the metal-complex azo dye solutions 
The influence of temperature, pH and the colorant concentration on the efficiency, of 
the colour reduction were investigated for the solutions of the dyes. 
188 Considering the results achieved from Section 3.3 and Section 3.4, the bacterial cells 
of Shewanella strain J18 143 have shown their ability to reduce colour from solutions 
of metal-complex azo dyes. The decoloration efficiency varies depending on the 
individual dye structures, chemical composition, solubility and polarity. Thus, the 
effect of the general factors, the dye concentration, the incubation temperature and 
the pH, on the colour reduction efficiency was investigated. The colour reduction 
rate was greater with increased dye concentration, except in the case of the Irgalan 
Yellow 3RL KWL. Therefore, there is no particular requirement optimisation of the 
dye concentration of the targeted metal-complex azo dyes. The decoloration of all of 
the four metal-complex azo dyes was shown to be more effective in the temperature 
range from 40 °C to 50 °C. However, the current consent for the temperature of the 
wastewater at the point of discharge is below 42 °C (Section 1.1.2). From the 
bacterium species point of view, the organism, Shewanella strain J18 14), is 
mesophilic, with a maximum rate of cell division at 35 °C. Above a temperature of 
37 °C, the growth rate of the culture falls sharply (Willmott, 1997). Since the growth 
rate of the culture was similar at incubation temperatures between 30 °C and 37 °C, 
the decoloration system could be operated at 30 °C, in order to minimise the risk of 
protein denaturation (Pearce, 2004, Willmott, 1997). The bacterial cells have been 
shown to be more effective in colour reduction of the metal-complex azo dyes under 
slightly higher than neutral pH conditions. Thus, the optimum of the operating pH for 
maximal growth of Shewanella strain J18 143 was at 8.10 (Willmott, 1997). Only 
slight differences in the reduction rate were found between pH 7 to pH 8. Thus. it is 
possible to maintain a neutral pH condition for the colour reduction system. 
189 5 Conclusions 
From the results that have been achieved, the following conclusions can be drawn. 
The cellulose-MAA graft copolymer can be used as a substrate for the 
immobilisation of species such as the biological cells of Shewanella strain J 18 143. 
The grafting yield of the graft copolymer used was averaged at 5.5%, with 0.1±0.01 
mol dm-3 of -COOH being present on the grafts. These are potentially available for 
coupling under suitable circumstances. 
The bacterial cells were immobilised by the methods of "growing-in", chemical 
coupling and physical adsorption. The average concentration of the immobilised cells 
existing on the substrate by these three methods was calculated respectively. 
"Growing-in" and chemical coupling are better the options for immobilisation. 
The decoloration of textile wastewaters using this immobilisation system is feasible. 
The colour of solutions of Remazol Black B was completely removed using the 
"growing-in" and the chemical coupling immobilised cells, after 24 hours and after 
48 hours of incubation, respectively. 72.1% of colour was removed from the dye 
solution, after 48 hours, by the adsorption method. 
The bacterial cells of Shewanella strain J18 143 have been shown to have the ability 
to reduce the colour of the solutions of some metal-complex azo dyes. This is a 
successful extension of the ranges of dye solutions that are known to be reduceable. 
Thus, it is now known that Irgalan Grey GLN. Irgalan Black RBLN and Irgalan Blue 
3GL can be reduced biologically. However, not all of the metal-complex azo dyes 
are able to be reduced by the bacterial cells (i. e. Irgalan Yello,. tiw 3RL KV\'L). 
The concept that of using the bacterial cells of Shelvanella strain J18 143 in the 
decoloration of dye solutions needs to be extended to other textile effluent treatments. 
Care will be needed to balance the effluents before treatments can begin. 
190 6 Suggestions for further work 
The decoloration of the reactive dye solutions using immobilised biological cells has 
achieved. The efficiency of the colour removal was compared between results 
obtained from the free cells and from the immobilised cells, and also among the 
different immobilisation methods. Effective protein assay of immobilised microbial 
cells or enzymes in this particular case would be useful to monitor the decoloration 
processes. 
The optimisation of the decoloration of the reactive dye solutions using immobilised 
cells is recommended, since the results obtained have shown much potential in 
practice. 
Extensive investigations into the mechanism of colour removal of the metal-complex 
azo dyes are strongly recommended, since it is a very important and determinant 
factor for the development and the optimisation of the decoloration processes 
involved with the use of the Sheii'anella strain J18 143 cells. Effective analysis of the 
by-products from the colour reduction of the metal-complex azo dyes, therefore, 
would be needed. 
It is additionally recommended that the evaluation of whether or not the bacterial 
cells are acting directly or indirectly with the dyes and, therefore, to establish the 
importance of water in the events that take place.
