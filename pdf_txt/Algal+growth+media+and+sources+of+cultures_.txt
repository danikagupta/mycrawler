Abstract: The basic requirements for high-density pho-
toautotrophic microalgal cultures in enclosed photobio-reactors are a powerful light source and proper distribu-tion of light, efficient gas exchange, and suitable mediumcomposition. This article introduces the concept of bal-ancing the elemental composition of growth mediumwith biomass composition to obtain high-density cul-tures. N-8 medium, commonly used for culturing
Chlor-
ella vulgaris was evaluated for its capacity to support
high-density cultures on the basis of elemental stoichio-metric composition of
C. vulgaris. This analysis showed
that the N-8 medium is deficient in iron, magnesium,sulfur, and nitrogen at high cell densities. N-8 mediumwas redesigned to contain stoichiometrically balancedquantities of the four deficient elements to support a bio-mass concentration of 2% (v/v). The redesigned medium,called M-8 medium, resulted in up to three- to fivefoldincrease in total chlorophyll content per volume of cul-ture as compared to N-8 medium. Further experimentsshowed that addition of each of the four elements sepa-rately to N-8 medium did not improve culture perfor-mance and that balanced supplementation of all four de-ficient elements was required to yield the improved per-formance. Long-term (24 d)
C. vulgaris culture in M-8
medium showed continuous increase in chlorophyll con-tent and biomass throughout the period of cultivation. Incontrast, the increase in chlorophyll content and biomassceased after 7 and 12 d, respectively in N-8 medium,demonstrating the higher capacity of M-8 medium toproduce biomass. Thus, the performance of high celldensity photobioreactors can be significantly enhancedby proper medium design. The elemental composition ofthe biomass generated is an appropriate basis for me-dium design.

INTRODUCTION
Microalgal cultures have found application for production
of oxygen for production of specialty chemicals, fuels andpharmaceuticals, industrial wastewater treatment, and life
support in space (Ben-Amotz and Avron, 1989; Benemannet al., 1980; Borowitzka, 1988; Glombitza and Koch, 1989;Goldman, 1979). A variety of photobioreactor (PBR) sys-tems (open and closed) have been used or proposed formicroalgae production (Dodd, 1986; Goldman, 1979; Os-wald, 1988; Terry and Raymond, 1985). Large open out-door pond cultivation is one of the oldest industrial systemsforalgalcultivationfortheproductionofsingle-cellprotein,health food, and b-carotene (Borowitzka and Borowitzka,
1989; Soong, 1980). Closed systems have been describedfor the production of biomass and some specialty chemicalsunder axenic conditions (Ionescu et al., 1994; Juttner, 1977;Kruger and Eloff, 1978; Pirt et al., 1983). Improvements inperformance of PBR systems have been obtained by opti-
mizing illuminating techniques, efficient gas and liquid ex-change units, and controlled nutrient supply (Javanmardianand Palsson, 1991b; Lee and Palsson, 1994; Lee and Bazin,1990; Mignot et al., 1989; Miyamoto et al., 1988; Mori,1985; Pirt et al., 1983). However, few studies focused onoptimal medium formulation for high-density PBR systemshave appeared.
High-density (3% fresh weight per volume) photoauto-
trophicChlorella vulgaris cultures have been obtained in
specially designed photobioreactors (Javanmardian andPalsson, 1991b). Performance of frequent on-line ultrafil-tration(uponreachingabiomassconcentrationof0.3%v/v)was necessary to obtain high cell densities. Population dis-tributions of per cell DNA content before and after ultrafil-tration revealed that the cells were blocked at some stage inthecellcycle.Thisblockageofcell-cycleprogressionledtocessation of growth and was accompanied by drop in percell chlorophyll content (Javanmardian, 1991). Sustainedoscillation in cell concentration and average per cell DNAcontent were observed in continuous cultures of C. vulgaris
at low dilution rates (0.1/d) (Javanmardian and Palsson,1991a). The two probable reasons for the cell-cycle modu-lation leading to inhibition of growth could be either thesecretion of auto-inhibitory compounds or the depletion ofspecific nutrients in the medium. The subject of autoinhibi-tory compounds has been thoroughly studied, and it hasbeen concluded that C. vulgaris does not secrete any such

the elemental composition and capacity of the growth me-dium were investigated.
Several media formulations (or ‘‘compositions’’) for the
cultivation of microalgae have been proposed. Many ofthesearederivedfromanalysisofthechemicalenvironmentin natural habitats where the algae thrive (Vonshak, 1986).There have been few media formulations based on detailedstudy (Provasoli and Printner, 1953) of nutrient require-ments. The elements required for the growth of green algaeare N, P, K, Mg, Ca, S, Fe, Cu, Mn, and Zn (Oh-Hama andMiyachi, 1988). These elements are added in the form ofsalts, a list of which is found in Kaplan and co-workers’published work (1986). The growth of Chlorella at various
concentrations of macro-nutrients and micro-nutrients havebeen studied (Eyster et al., 1958). There have been exten-sive studies on the effect of concentrations and sources ofnitrogen or nitrogen to phosphorus ratio in the medium onthe growth and photosynthetic rates of Chlorella (Huang et
al., 1994; Jeanfils, 1993; Tam and Wong, 1996). It is alsorecognized that the nutrient uptake is a function of variousfactors such as population density, light, temperature, andpH (Kaplan et al., 1986; Rai et al., 1996). Further, the el-emental composition of Chlorella changes at different
stages of growth and under different conditions such asnitrogen-deficiency (Harrison et al., 1990; Oh-Hama andMiyachi, 1988). The variation in the elemental compositionofC. vulgaris has been reported (Oh-Hama and Miyachi,
1988). Many media compositions have been suggested forculturing Chlorella (Endo et al., 1977; Endo et al., 1974;
Myers, 1951; Sorokin and Krauss, 1958; Vonshak, 1986;Watanabe, 1960). The medium, N-8 (Vonshak, 1986), hasbeen widely used for mass culturing Chlorella.
Mediumcompositioncanbeformulatedbasedonvarious
parameters such as cellular and metabolic stoichiometry(Varma and Palsson, 1994). In this study, we have chosenelemental composition of biomass as the basis for evaluat-ing the biomass capacity of the nutrient in a closed system.
BIOMASS ELEMENTAL COMPOSITION AND
STOICHIOMETRIC MEDIUM FORMULATION
The elemental composition of Chlorella species as reported
by Oh-Hama and Miyachi (1988) is shown in Table I. Thesource of carbon for photoautotrophic growth is carbon di-oxide. It was found that sparging of 5–10% CO
2was suf-
ficienttoobtaincellconcentrationso f5×109cells/mL.The
elements N, P, K, Mg, S, Fe, Ca, Zn, Cu, and Mn areprovided by the medium.
TheN-8medium,usedforculturing Chlorella consistsof
macro- and micro-nutrients (Vonshak, 1986) the composi-tions of which are given in Tables II and III. The elementswere evaluated for biomass capacity based on the higherrange of the values of elemental composition. The amount(g) of each element i n1Lo fmedium was calculated from
the Tables II and III. The maximum biomass capacity ofeachelementwasdeterminedbyconsideringtheamount(g)of each element i n1Lo fmedium (from Tables II and III)
and the fraction of that particular element in the dry weightofcell(fromTableI).Thebiomasscapacityofeachelementin terms of biomass % (v/v) for N-8 and M-8 medium istabulated in Table IV. The biomass % (v/v) is calculated asfollows:Biomass%(v/v) 4(Amountoftheelementinunit
volume of medium/fraction of dry weight of the element) ×(1/dry weight fraction of cell) × (1/density of fresh cells) ×100. The capacity in terms of cells/mL can be obtained bydividing biomass by volume of each fresh cell. Dry weightof the cell was taken to be 25% of fresh weight and densityof fresh cells to be 1.01 g/mL (Myers, 1962). The averagecell volume was found to be 40 femtoliters (fl).
The analysis in Table IV clearly indicates that the me-
diumisdeficientofiron,magnesium,sulfur,andnitrogenathigh cell concentrations. The symptoms of cultures defi-cient in the four elements are well documented. In the ab-sence of iron, retardation of growth, reduction of photosyn-thetic activity, and chlorophyll content is observed (Wiesn-ner, 1962). The cells loose chlorophyll when grown inmagnesium deficient cultures (Bogorad, 1962) and cell di-vision is blocked in sulfur-deficient cultures (Hase, 1962).Nitrogendeficiencyleadstoadropinnitrogencontentfrom8% to 2% of dry weight and a reduction in chlorophyllcontent. Also, the products of photosynthesis change fromprotein to carbohydrate and lipid (Syrett, 1962).

606 BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOENGINEERING, VOL. 59, NO. 5, SEPTEMBER 5, 1998N-8 medium was redesigned with the deficient nutrients
with an objective to support a biomass concentration of∼2% v/v (∼5×1 0
8cells/mL). The amounts of KNO3and
MgSO4wereincreasedthree-andeightfold,respectively,in
the medium to support the targeted biomass concentration.The amount of iron was increased by adding FeSO
4(0.13
g/L) to the medium instead of increasing the amount ofFeEDTA 18-fold (0.18 g/L). However, FeEDTA was main-tained at its original concentration (0.01 g/L) in the rede-signedmedium.Themacro-nutrientcompositionofthestoi-chiometrically balanced medium (called M-8 mediumhenceforth) is shown in Table II. The amount of micro-nutrients were maintained the same as N-8 medium.
MATERIALS & METHODS
Cell Line and Culture Conditions
The N-8 and M-8 media were prepared based on the com-
position described in Tables II and III, and sterilized usinga 0.22 mm (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) filter. The ex-
perimentswereconductedin100mLspinnerflasks(Bellco,Vineland, NJ) with 60 mL working volume. Agitation wasprovidedbyasuspendedmagneticstirbar.AMultistirstirrer(Bellco, Vineland, NJ) was used to agitate the spinners at150 rpm. Exponentially growing C. vulgaris (UTEX 398,
UTEX Culture Collection of Algae, Texas), was cultivatedat 5% CO
2balanced with air at 25°C. Each flask was illu-minated with two circular cool white 22-W fluorescent
lamps (General Electric, Inc., Cleveland, OH).
Samples were collected every 24 h. The cell number, cell
volume, and chlorophyll content were monitored. The cellnumber and average cell volume were measured usingCoulter Counter Model ZM (Coulter Electronics, Inc., Hi-aleah, FL). This unit includes a Coulter Channelyzer, whichcanmeasureparticlesizedistributions.Thestatisticalanaly-sis of size distribution is done via a Coulter AccuCompSystem for the Channelyzer C256 instrument. The volumet-ric biomass content at any particular time point was calcu-lated by multiplying cell count of the culture and the aver-age cell volume at that time. The pH of the cultures weremeasured using Orion 520A pH meter (Orion Research,Inc., Boston, MA).
Longterm cultures were performed in a Bioflo II (New
Brunswick Scientific, Edison, NJ) , a 3 L-batch/continuous
fermentor with a working volume of 2.5 L. The culture wasgrown at a constant temperature of 25°C and illuminated byfour circular cool white 40-W fluorescent lamps (a lightintensity in the order of 10–15 mW/cm
2at the reactor sur-
face). The medium temperature was measured by a Resis-tanceTemperatureDetector(RTD)thermometersubmergedin a thermowell. A flow rate of 100 mL/min of 5% CO
2
supplemented with air was supplied to the Bioflo through aring sparger, and the flowrate was controlled by the needlevalve of the flowmeter. The culture was agitated at a speedof 200 rpm. The system was able to provide 1.5 times ofvolumeofsterileairpervolumeofgrowthchamberthrough0.2mmreplaceablecartridgefilter.Theculturewassampled
every 24 h through a hooded sampler.
Chlorophyll was extracted from samples using 100%
methanol (Hitkins and Baker, 1986). The samples were di-luted 10–20 times by methanol depending on the cell con-centration. The vials containing the samples were wrappedwith aluminum foil and stored at 4°C for 30 min. Thesamples were then centrifuged at 16,000 gfor 10 min. The
absorbance of the green supernatant was measured at twowavelengths, 650 and 665 nm. The chlorophyll a (mg/L),chlorophyll b (mg/L), and total chlorophyll content (mg/L)were then calculated using the equations described by Hit-kins and Baker (1986).

MANDALAM AND PALSSON: ELEMENTALLY BALANCED ALGAL MEDIUM 607Cell Growth and Cell Volume
The initial cellular growth rates (until 96 h) of the four
cultures were similar as shown in Figure 1a. Chlorella rep-
licates its DNA to produce 2ndaughter cells per division
burst. The mature cells divide to produce 2, 4, or 8 daughtercells depending on the culture conditions (Donnan et al.,1985;Morimura,1959;Tamiyaetal.,1961;Tamiya,1964).The increase in the average cell volume at 24, 72, and 168h indicate the synchronous cell division in cultures. It ap-pears that a percentage of cells in M-8 medium go throughthree complete rounds of replications compared to two in
N-8 medium (Fig. 1). The cultures became light limited atconcentrations o f1×1 0
7cells/mL, beyond which a linear
increase in cell number is observed. The cell number andbiomass [(cell number) × (average cell volume)] profileover the period of cultivation shows lack of growth in N-8medium after 168 h (Figs. 1 and 2) indicating deficiency ofnutrients. Increase in magnesium alone in the medium re-sulted in higher cell number, although increase in nitrogen
alone did not make much difference.

A significant difference was observed in the total chloro-
phyll content in M-8 medium cultures compared to othercultures (Fig. 2b). The chlorophyll content of M-8 mediumculture increased continuously up to 192 h and was 3 timeshigher than the other cultures. The chlorophyll content ofother cultures did not increase after 96 h although the bio-mass increased in all cultures at least up to 168 h. Additionof nitrogen alone did not result in increase in total biomassand total chlorophyll content. Addition of magnesium re-sulted in increase in biomass but not in chlorophyll content.The increase in chlorophyll and biomass was observed forthe same period of time in M-8 cultures.
Effect of M-8 Medium in Long Term Cultures
Chlorella vulgaris was cultivated i n 3 L fermentors (with
2.5 L working volume) to study the growth capacity of themediumforlong-term,large-scalecultures.Twofermentors(Bioflo) were maintained under identical conditions withcells growing in N-8 medium in one fermentor and M-8(redesigned medium) in the other. The culture was main-tained for 24 d.
Biomass and Chlorophyll Content
The cell growth and average cell volume were measured
over the period of cultivation and the biomass concentra-tions were calculated. The growth rate in the fermentor wasslower than the flasks due to the lower light availability inthe fermentors (a consequence of lower light intensity onthe surface and larger diameter of the fermentor). The bio-mass profile showed a cessation of growth at 0.9% v/v inN-8mediumculture,butacontinuousincreaseinbiomassatan uniform rate was observed in M-8 medium (Fig. 3). Theconstant rate of biomass production indicated that the nu-trient capacity of M-8 medium was higher than N-8 me-dium.
The total chlorophyll content of M-8 culture was 2–3
times higher than the N-8 culture (Fig. 3b). The total chlo-rophyll content of cells in M-8 medium continuously in-creased reflecting on the enhanced capacity of the mediumto maintain photoautotrophic cultures. The increase in chlo-rophyll content in N-8 medium ceased at 168 h in N-8medium even though the biomass increase continued foranother 100 h.
DISCUSSION
With the wide range of potential industrial uses of micro-
algae, the need for high-density viable cultures is increas-ing. Significant increases in biomass productivities havebeen achieved in enclosed photobioreactors with the use ofa powerful light source and efficient light distribution (Leeand Palsson, 1994). The benefits of a well-engineered de-sign of a PBR can only be realized if the biological limita-tions (such as nutrient limitation and build-up of harmful
secondary metabolites) are overcome. An earlier detailedstudy has shown that the organism under investigation, C.
vulgaris, does not secrete any autoinhibitory or harmful
factors at high-cell concentrations which would inhibit orretard growth (Mandalam and Palsson, 1995). The presentstudyhasdemonstratedtheabilityofwell-balancedmediumto achieve high cell densities.
TheanalysisofN-8mediumbasedontheelementalcom-
position revealed the deficiency of iron, magnesium, sulfur,and nitrogen at high cell concentrations. It appears that theN-8 medium can support an increase in both biomass andchlorophyll content up to a cell density of 1 × 10
8cells/mLFigure 3. Biomass (a) and total chlorophyll content (b) increase in long-
termC. vulgaris cultures in N-8 (circle) and M-8 (square) media.
MANDALAM AND PALSSON: ELEMENTALLY BALANCED ALGAL MEDIUM 609[0.4% (v/v) biomass]. The blockage of cell cycle and tem-
porary loss of chlorophyll observed at high cell densities inan earlier study (Javanmardian and Palsson, 1991) can beattributed to the deprivation of the elements mentionedabove.
This study has used the simple cellular elemental com-
position as the basis for redesigning algal growth media. Itis often assumed that the limiting nutrients are nitrogen andphosphorus (elements that comprise higher percentages inthecellularcomposition),andtheotherelementsarealwaysin excess in the medium. Therefore, it has been recom-mendedthatadditionofthemajorelementscanincreasetheoverall capacity of the medium. It was observed in thisstudy that addition of nitrogen to N-8 medium did not sig-nificantly result in an increase in biomass or chlorophyll.However,additionofmagnesiumtoN-8mediumresultedinan increase in biomass content and not chlorophyll content.This result was interesting in the light that cells need mag-nesium to synthesize chlorophyll. It has been reported thatinC. vulgaris cultures, as nitrogen deficiency develops, the
amount of chlorophyll in the cells decreases faster than thenitrogen content, and the accumulation of carbohydratestarts much earlier than fat (Syrett, 1962). Although theexact changes in biomass composition are not known, it islikely that the increase in biomass and decrease in chloro-phyll content (in N-8 medium cultures supplemented withMg) is an outcome of this process. Thus, the results fromthis study clearly indicated that the addition of one of themajor deficient elements to N-8 medium is not sufficient tosupport balanced photoautotrophic growth. The synergisticeffect of the elements in addition to the components of N-8medium showed the enhanced performance (increase inboth biomass and chlorophyll content), thus emphasizingthe importance of a balanced medium.
The continuous increase in biomass and chlorophyll con-
tentinlarge-scale,long-termM-8mediumphotoautotrophiccultures has demonstrated the enhanced capacity of the me-diumtosupporthigh-densitycultures.High-densityculturescan be achieved in photobioreactors with minimal, or evenwithout any, change of medium or perfusion. The growthrate is influenced by light intensity and delivery as the pen-etration depth of light decreases with increase in cell con-centration. M-8 medium has the capacity of increasing thegrowth rate, biomass and chlorophyll productivity signifi-cantly in the presence of a powerful light source and uni-formlightdelivery.Theenhancedchlorophyllcontentcouldpotentially result in increased oxygen production as eachmole of chlorophyll produces 50–400 mol of oxygen perhour (Myers and Graham, 1971). This study has underlinedthe significance of medium development in achieving high-density cultures.
