Abstract 
The laboratory-scale UASB reactors were operated at five  different hydraulic retention times (HRTs). The various 
sizes of granules from three different sources: a cassava factory (CS), a seafood factory (SS), and a palm oil mill 
(PS), having the size range of 1.5-1.7 mm, 0.7-1.0 mm and 0.1-0.2 mm. respectively, were used as inocula for 
anaerobic digestion of cassava wastewater. For comparison, the first reactor with only granules from its own source (R1, CS) was treated as control. The other two reactors were  inoculated with mixed granules from different sources 
(R2, CS+SS and R3, CS+PS). As HRT decreased from 5 days to 1 day, the organic removal efficiencies decreased from 
91.49  to 43.23  %, 89.36 to 45.13 % and 87.23 to 32.69 % for R1, R2 and R3 respectively (or inversely with 
increasing OLR). In this study selected mathematical mode ls including Monod, Contois, Grau second-order and 
Modified Stover-Kicannon kinetic models were applied to determine the substrate removal kinetics of UASB reactors. Kinetic parameters were determined through linear regression using experimental data obtained from the steady-state experiments and subsequently used to predict effluent COD. The results showed that Grau second-order 
and Modified Stover-Kicannon kinetic models were more suitable than the others for predicting the substrate removal 
for all different sizes of granules. In addition the Up flow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) reactor with only 
granules from a cassava factory gave the best performance.

1. Introduction  
 
There is a large potential to convert wastewaters from agro -industry into energy . In Thailand, a 
'
Strategic Plan for Renewable Energy Development' has been esta blished since 2003. It aims to increase 
the share  of renewable energy from 6.4%  or 4,237 kilo tons of crude oil equivalent (ktoe) per year in 2008 
to 20.
3% of the commercial primary energ y or 19,700 ktoe per year  by the year 2022. Although Thailand 
is an agric
ulture  country with the large volume of potential biogas feed stocks, only two major sources are 
currentl
y utilized for biogas production: wastewaters from cassava starch factories and pig farms  [1].  
Agro -industries are major contributors to worldwide industrial pollution  including Thailand. Effluents 
fr
om many agro -industries are hazardous to the environment and require appropriate and comprehensive 
ma
nagement approach  [2]. The anaerobic digestion is an envi ronm entally friendly to treat agro -industrial 
w
astewater. It is widely used not only to treat wastewater but also to generating biogas, a clean and 
renewable energy which can substitute energy from fossil sources as targeted by current Thai energy 
policy.  
Many researchers found that wastewater from  cassava starch factory are suitable for  anaerobic process 
particu
larly for UASB reactor  in which  wastewater was supplied from the bottom of the reactor and the 
org
anic matter is digested as the wastewater moves upward. During digestion, methane gas bubbles are 
produced and carry the sludges upwards , resulting in the formation of dense sludge flocs  (granules) that 
readily
 settle  [3, 4]. 
 The successful treatment in UASB reactor is pr in cipally attributed to the formation of anaerobic 
granules  in sludge bed . The granule size is an important parameter  directly influences the performance of 
reacto
r. Other factors affecting the performance of UASB reactor include temperature, organic loading 
rate, pH, alkalinity and nutrients etc  [5]. The scope of this research is to stu dy the effect of granule sizes 
on the performance of UASB rectors  for cassava wastewater treatment in term of organic removal  and 
biogas potential from different sizes of inocula/granules using kinetic model s. The preliminary results in 
th
is work could be valuable for design and operation in continuous biogas plant s.

2. Materials and methods  
2.1 Wastewater and Seed  
The wastewater sample was collected from a cassava fa ctory . Characteristics of wastewater are shown 
in Table 1 . It was kept at 0 -4 oC until used in  the experiments.  The granular sludges were collected from 
th
e methanogen fermentation stage of the UASB  reactors from three sources: cassava factory  (CS) having 
th
e size range of 1.5 -1.7 mm, seafood factory  (SS) having the size range of 0.7 -1.0 mm  and palm oil mill 
(PS) having the size  range of 0.1 -0.2 mm. The Specific methanogenic activities (SMA) were 0.28, 0.26 
and
 0.16 gCOD/gVSS.d respectively.

2.2 Reactor  and Operating condition  
The three identical laboratory -scale  UASB  reactors were used in this study. They have cylindrical 
s
hape with 100 cm  high, 5.4 cm internal diameter and 2.06 L working volumes. The feed was pump by 
peristaltic pu
mp (Longer pump, Model BT 100 -1F, DG -4 channel pump head) at the rate defined by 
HRT
. Three reactors were operated continuously at five hy draulic retention  times (HRT s) of 5, 4, 3, 2 and 
1 day. The corresponding organic loading rates (O L R) were 3.76, 4.7, 6. 27, 9.4 and 18.8 kg COD /m-3d-1 
respectively.  
 
2.3 Analytical procedures  
Chemical oxygen demand (COD), Total Khjdhal  Nitrogen (TKN), Total Phosphorus (TP), Total 
Solids 
(TS), Volatile Solids (VS), Su spended Solids (SS), Volatile Suspen ded Solids (VSS), Alkalinity, 
Volatile Fatty Acids (VFA) and pH  were analyzed. All analytical procedures were  performed in 
acco
rdance with standard methods for examination of water and wastewater APHA  [6]. Gas production 
were measured daily by using  water displacement method  [7]. The methane content was measured using 
Gas Ch
romatograph (GC-8A Shimadzu).  
3. Kinetic model  
3.1 Monod kinetic model  
In a UASB reactor without biomass recycle,  the rate  of change  in biomass and substrate concentration 
in
 the system can be expressed as equation 1, 2  [8-10]. 
ௗ௑
ௗ௧ = ொ௑೚

ିௗௌ
ௗ௧ = ொௌ೚
௏-ொௌ
௏ + ఓ௑
௒          (2) 
 The ratio of the  total biomass in the reactor to the biomass wasted in a given time period represents 
th
e average time that microorganism spend in the reactor. This parameter is called mean cell -residence  
time (Tc) and is calculated from equation  3 for UASB reactor.  
ߠ௖= ௏௑
ொ௑೐           (3) 
 Assuming that the concentration of biomass in the influent can be ignored, at steady -stateݐ݀ܺ݀ Τ = 0, 
and th
e HRT (TH) is defined as the volume of the reactor divided by the flow rate of the influent. The 
relationship between the specific growth rate and the rate limiting substrate concentration can be 
expressed by  the Monod as  shown in equation 4   Sunwanee Jijai et al.  /  Energy Procedia   79  ( 2015 )  90 – 97 93

 Under steady -state conditions, the rate of change  in substrate concentration ( ݐ݀ܵ݀ Τ) is negligible and , 
by a similar technique to that used for the substrate concentration, equation  2 can be reduced to equation 8 
by
 substituting equation 6

rearrang

3.2 Contois model  
 Similar to  Monod model, in Contois model, the relationsh ip between the specific growth rate and the 
rate limiting substrate concentration can be expr essed by the equation 12 as shown below:  
ߤ =ఓ೘ೌೣௌ

 Again the kinetic parameters Y and ܭௗ can be calculate d from the slope and intercept of the best -fit

equation 12 into equation 9 and rearranging we obtain equation 13 and 14. Finally , we can predict the 
ef
fluent substrate concentration of reactor using equation 15.

3.4 Modified Stover -Kicannon  model  
 In this model the substrate utilizatio n  rate is expressed as a function of  the organic loading rate using 
monomolecular kinetics. A special feature of the Modified Stover/Kicannon  model is  it uses the total 
org
anic loading rate as the major parameter to describe the kinetics of an anaerobic reactor in terms of 94   Sunwanee Jijai et al.  /  Energy Procedia   79  ( 2015 )  90 – 97

4. Results and discussion  
4.1 Reactor Performance  
The UASB reactors were operated at  five different  hydraulic retention times (HRTs), namely 5, 4, 3, 2 
an
d 1 days.  The steady state COD  removal efficiency decreased from 91.49 to 43.23 %, 89.36 to 45.13 % 
an
d 87.23 to 32.69 % for R1,  R2 and R3 respectively, with de creasin g hydraulic retention times  from 5 
day
s to 1 day . This was because the decreasing  of HRT led to shorter residence time, thus lowering the 
ef
ficiency . It also showed that the sizes of granule had a stron g effect on the process performance and 
substrate removal  in the UASB reactors. The UASB reactor R1 u sed only granules from cassava factory 
which had biggest average sizes (1.5 -1.7 mm) gave the highest substrate removal and biogas production.  
For the UASB reactors R1 and R2 COD removal eff iciency  became less than 60% at 1 day HRT with 
OLR of 18.8 KgCOD/m3d, while for R3 the COD removal efficiency  became less than 60% at 2 day HRT 
w
ith OLR of 9.4 KgCOD/m3d because  of the disintegration and wash away of biomass or granules along 
w
ith the effluent due to high mixing  intensities  [12, 13]. Moreover,  as the HRTs decrease d from 5 to 1 
day
s, the pH in all three reactors decreased from 7.2 to 5.8 , the alkalinity in  all three reactors (R1, R2 and 
R
3) decreased from 3 ,266.67 to 2 ,404.17, 3,283.33 to 2,471.53 and 2,858.33 to 2,316.67 mg/lasCaCO 3 
respectively. In contrary  the volatile fatty acid (VFA) increased with decreasing  HRTs for R1, R2 and R3  
(223.61 to 2,433.17 , 215.28 to 2,612.50 and 145.14 to 2,554.17 mg/lasCaCO 3 respectively ). This 
in
dicated that acidogenesis occurred more ra pidly than acitogenes is and methanogenesis , thus the later 
steps became the rate -limiting step s which dictated the performance of UASB  reactors. 
 
4.2 Kinetic model  
All kinetic parameters for all four models obtained by fitting stead - state experimental data to the 
m
odel equations (equation 9, 10, 13, 14, 1 7, 18 and 22) are shown in table 2, 3. These results were similar 
to th
e study of Abtahi et al, 2013, Isik and Sponza, 2005 and Mullai et al, 2011[8, 10, 12] .  
Table 2 summarizes the kinetic constants determined from Monod and Contois  models in previous 
stu
dies as compared to this study. It should be noted that the substrate concentration used in this study 
were many times greater than that of most previous  studies and thus substrate inhibition may have a 
significant effect on the reactor performance. In general, the biomass yield in term of Y (gVSS/gCOD) 
was an order of magnitude lower in our work than that of most previous works. This can mislead to 
conclude that there were little new cell generation here since methane production is strongly growth 
associated. The better explanatio n is that in our cases the cell density is so high (because of the formed 
granules) such that the limiting substrate could not be supplie d throughout the gran ule mass, causing 
partial cell starvation, death and lysis which  almost balance with new cell generation.  
Moreover, it was found that UASB -R1 (biggest size in the range 1.5 -1.7 mm.) gave the lowest death 
rate co
nstant value (K d), whereas UASB -R3 which had smallest granule size showed highest K d. It should  
be stated here that Y, μmax and K d are apparent values rather than the true ones. That is why we see that 
th
ese values in our work were much lower th an that of other works particularly for UASB -R1 which had 
h
ighest granules size. The true values should be  much higher than  these values but, because both cell 
g
eneration, washout and lysis occurred simultaneously and with similar rates, and we saw only the net 
effect thus small apparent growth ( μmax) and dead rate (K d).

Other interesting results were the saturated constant (K s) in Monod model and kinetic parameter (β) in 
Contois  models. Whereas high β in UASB -R1 reflected strong negative effect of granule size on the 
su
bstrate accessibility of microbial cells, K s in Monod model indirectly showed similar trend albeit with 
dif
ferent interpretation. Highest K s values in UASB -R1 was a combined effect of high cell density (thus 
h
igh substrate demand) and diffusion -limiting in -granule substrate transport, both  were a result of the 
biggest granule size. The apparent high K s value is again does not explain high half -substrate 
co
nsumption rate according to Monod model formula tion. So there is no surprise that both Monod and 
Contois models could not represent the experimental results so well since their basis in model formulation 
do not directly include diffusion -limiting step into consideration. Co n sequently, Monod and Contois are 
fundamentally unsuitable for modeling UASB with granules and some diffusion -limited consideration 
m
ust be included in the formulation.  
Table 3 summarizes the kinetic constants determined for Grau  second -order and Modified Stover -
Kicannon  models in previous studies as compar ed  to this studies. The kinetic value (K B, R max) in 
Modified Stover -Kicannon model suggest that the substrate re m oval rate is strongl y affected by the 
granule size. The kinetic value of this model (K B, R max) all three reactor (R1, R2, R3) were lower than 
studies of Büyükkamaci and Filibeli, 2002 (S 0=2,000 -15,000 mg/l) [ 14]. But higher than the study of 
A
btahi et al. (S 0=704.55 mg/l) [8] and Sponza and Uluköy, 2008 [9] (S 0=3,000 mg/l). The different of 
kinetic coefficients value because each studies different of initial substrate (S 0) and different of 
granule/inocula that use in each reactors [15].

4.3 Model evaluation 
The kinetic values can be use d to explained performance of UASB re actors and to predict the  effluent 
COD f
rom UASB reactor s. From four kinetic model s (Monod, Contois, Grau -second order, Modified 
Stov
er-Kicannon  model), when  compared with data from experiments,  Grau -second order and Modified 
Stov
er-Kicannon  models  were more suitable for predicting COD effluent as indicated by  higher 
regress
ion coefficients (higher  than 0.9 8) for all the rectors (R1, R2 and R3)

5. Conclusion  
The results of this study showed that sizes of granules highly affected  the reactor  performance and 
biog
as production in UASB reactors. The COD remo val efficiencies and biogas production decreased 
with decreased HRTs. The experimental data  of UASB reactor treating  cassava wastewater were  in good 
agreem
ent with the kinetic models  particularly Grau second -order and Modifield Stover -Kicannon 
m
odels.
