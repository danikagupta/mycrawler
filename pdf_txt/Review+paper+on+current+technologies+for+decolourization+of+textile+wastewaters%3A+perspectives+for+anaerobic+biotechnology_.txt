Abstract
Dyes are natural and xenobiotic compounds that make the world more beautiful through coloured substances. However, the release
of coloured wastewaters represents a serious environmental problem and a public health concern. Colour removal, especially from textile
wastewaters, has been a big challenge over the last decades, and up to now there is no single and economically attractive treatment that
can eﬀectively decolourise dyes. In the passed years, notable achievements were made in the use of biotechnological applications to textilewastewaters not only for colour removal but also for the complete mineralization of dyes. Diﬀerent microorganisms such as aerobic and
anaerobic bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes have been found to catalyse dye decolourisation. Moreover, promising results were obtained
in accelerating dye decolourisation by adding mediating compounds and/or changing process conditions to high temperatures. Thispaper provides a critical review on the current technologies available for decolourisation of textile wastewaters and it suggests eﬀective
and economically attractive alternatives.

1. Introduction
With the increased demand for textile products, the tex-
tile industry and its wastewaters have been increasing pro-portionally, making it one of the main sources of severepollution problems worldwide. In particular, the releaseof coloured eﬄuents into the environment is undesirable,not only because of their colour, but also because manydyes from wastewater and their breakdown products are
toxic and/or mutagenic to life ( Weisburger, 2002 ). Without
adequate treatment these dyes are stable and can remain inthe environment for an extended period of time. For
instance, the half-life of hydrolysed Reactive Blue 19
(RB19) is about 46 years at pH 7 and 25 /C176C(Hao et al.,
2000). In addition to the environmental problem, the textile
industry consumes large amounts of potable water. Inmany countries where potable water is scarce, this largewater consumption has become intolerable and wastewaterrecycling has been recommended in order to decrease thewater requirements.
Textile wastewaters are characterized by extreme ﬂuc-
tuations in many parameters such as chemical oxygendemand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), pH,colour and salinity ( Table 1 ). The wastewater composition
will depend on the diﬀerent organic-based compounds,chemicals and dyes used in the industrial dry and wet-pro-cessing steps ( Talarposhti et al., 2001; Dos Santos et al.,
2006a ).

The most common textile-processing set-up ( Fig. 1 ) con-
sists of desizing, scouring, bleaching, mercerising and dye-ing processes ( EPA, 1997; Dos Santos, 2001; Dos Santos
et al., 2006a ).Sizing is the ﬁrst preparation step, in which
sizing agents such as starch, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) andcarboxymethyl cellulose are added to provide strength tothe ﬁbres and minimize breakage. Desizing is the employed
next to remove sizing materials prior to weaving. Scouring
then removes impurities from the ﬁbres by using alkali
solution (commonly sodium hydroxide) to breakdown nat-ural oils, fats, waxes and surfactants, as well as to emulsifyand suspend impurities in the scouring bath. Bleaching is
the step used to remove unwanted colour from the ﬁbresby using chemicals such as sodium hypochlorite and hydro-gen peroxide. Mercerising is a continuous chemical process
used to increase dye-ability, lustre and ﬁbre appearance. In
this step a concentrated alkaline solution is applied and an
acid solution washes the ﬁbres before the dyeing step.Finally, Dyeing is the process of adding colour to the ﬁbres,
which normally requires large volumes of water not only inthe dyebath, but also during the rinsing step . Depending on
the dyeing process, many chemicals like metals, salts, sur-factants, organic processing assistants, sulphide and form-aldehyde, may be added to improve dye adsorption ontothe ﬁbres. Fig. 1 shows some potential pollutants from cot-
ton processing operations in which the desizing/scouringand dyebath/rinsing wastewaters are mainly composed oforganic pollutants and colour-causing pollutants, respec-
tively ( Snowden-Swan, 1995 ).
2. Dye classiﬁcation and mechanism of ﬁxation
2.1. Dye classiﬁcation
Dyes are classiﬁed according to their application and
chemical structure. They are composed of a group of atomsresponsible for the dye colour, called chromophores, aswell as an electron withdrawing or donating substituentsthat cause or intensify the colour of the chromophores,called auxochromes ( Christie, 2001 ). The most importantNomenclature

aIn case of some reactive dyes the salt concentration in the dyebath (dyeing process) can reach concentrations up to 60–100 g/L. Therefore, the values
listed in the table can vary enormously depending on the type of the ﬁbre and dye class.2370 A.B. dos Santos et al. / Bioresource Technology 98 (2007) 2369–2385chromophores are azo (–N @N–), carbonyl (–C @O),
methine (–CH @), nitro (–NO 2) and quinoid groups. The
most important auxochromes are amine (–NH 3), carboxyl
(–COOH), sulfonate (–SO 3H) and hydroxyl (–OH). It is
worth to mention that the sulfonate groups confer veryhigh aqueous solubility to the dyes. The auxochromescan belong to the classes of reactive, acid, direct, basic,mordant, disperse, pigment, vat, anionic and ingrain,sulphur, solvent and disperse dye ( Welham, 2000 ).Fig. 2
gives an illustration of the chemical structure of several
dye molecules.
It is estimated that almost 10
9kg of dyes are produced
annually in the world, of which azo dyes represent about70% by weight ( Zollinger, 1987 ). This group of dyes is
characterised by reactive groups that form covalent bondswith OH–, NH–, or SH– groups in ﬁbres (cotton, wool,
silk, nylon). Azo dyes are mostly used for yellow, orange
and red colours ( Christie, 2001 ). To obtain the target col-
our, normally a mixture of red, yellow and blue dyes isapplied in the dyebaths. These three dyes do not necessarilyhave the same chemical structure. They might containmany diﬀerent chromophores, in which azo, anthraquinoneand phthalocyanine dyes are the most important groups(Hao et al., 2000 ). Anthraquinone dyes constitute the
second most important class of textile dyes, after azo
dyes ( Baughman and Weber, 1994 ). Anthraquinone dyes
have a wide range of colours in almost the whole visiblespectrum, but they are most commonly used for violet,blue and green colours ( Christie, 2001; Fontenot et al.,
2003).

Fibres can take up dyes as a result of van der Waals
forces, hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions.
The uptake of the dye in ﬁbres depends on the dye nature
and its chemical constituents. The strongest dye-ﬁbreattachment is a result of a covalent bond with an additionalelectrostatic interaction where the dye ion and ﬁbre haveopposite charges ( Welham, 2000 ).
In alkaline conditions, i.e. pH 9–12 and salt concentra-
tion from 40 to 100 g/l, and at high temperatures (30–70/C176C), dyes form reactive groups such as vinyl sulfone
(–SO
4–CH@CH 2) and chlorotriazinyl, that form bonds
with the ﬁbres. However, the reactive groups undergohydrolysis, i.e. a spontaneous reaction that occurs in thepresence of water, and because the products do not haveany aﬃnity with the ﬁbres, they do not form a covalentbond. Therefore, a high amount of dye constituents are dis-charged in the wastewater ( Hao et al., 2000 ). The ﬁxation
eﬃciency varies with the class of azo dye used, which is
around 98% for basic dyes and 50% for reactive dyes
(O’Neill et al., 1999 ). Large amounts of salts such assodium nitrate, sodium sulphate and sodium chloride are
used in the dyebath ( Carliell et al., 1998 ), as well as sodium
hydroxide is widely applied to increase the pH to the alka-line range. It is estimated that during the mercerising pro-cess the weight of these salts can make up 20% of the ﬁbreweight ( EPA, 1997 ).
3. Colour measurement in coloured wastewaters
The electromagnetic spectrum can be divided in three
diﬀerent regions: ultraviolet, visible light and infrared
(Table 2 ). Although visible light is considered to be
between the wavelengths of 350 and 780 nm, the humaneye can normally detect radiations between the wave-lengths of 380 and 720 nm ( Christie, 2001 ).
Colour in water can be either a result of natural phe-
nomena like the presence of humic substances, naturalmetallic ions, e.g. iron and manganese, and/or plankton;or the colour can also result from an artiﬁcial phenomenon
like the discharge of dyes and pigments. Industrial pro-
cesses such as textile, chemical and pharmaceuticalindustries may discharge large amounts of coloured waste-waters into water bodies. In general, colour in water isclassiﬁed in terms of true colour, i.e. when the sample isturbidity-free, or apparent colour, i.e. when the sample ismeasured without previous treatment ( APHA, 1998 ). The
most common methods to measure the colour of water
and wastewater are visual comparison and spectrophotom-
etry, although there is still a lack of a universal method toclassify coloured wastewater emissions. By visual compari-
son, colour is quantiﬁed by comparing the sample colour
with either known concentrations of coloured standards(normally a platinum–cobalt solution), or properly cali-brated colour disks. This method is currently used in watertreatment plants as a control parameter mainly because of
its simplicity, but it is not applicable for highly coloured
industrial wastewaters. In the spectrophotometric method
(Table 3 ), colour-measuring protocols diﬀer between the

coloured wastewaters and the azo dye products, aromaticamines, by UV spectrophotometric detection, is reportedelsewhere ( Pinheiro et al., 2004 ).
4. Decolourisation processes
In the following items we will try to cover the biological
and non-biological processes for dye decolourisation. It isworth to mention that this review gives a special attentionto the azo dyes, because they represent the largest classof dyes used in industries, and due to the broad literatureavailable.
4.1. Biological colour removal by aerobes
4.1.1. Bacteria
Aromatic compounds are susceptible to biological deg-
radation under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions(Field et al., 1995 ). Under aerobic conditions, the enzymes
mono- and di-oxygenase catalyse the incorporation of oxy-
gen from O
2into the aromatic ring of organic compounds
prior to ring ﬁssion ( Madigan et al., 2003 ). In most mono-
oxygenases, the electron donor is NADH or NAD(P)H,even though the direct coupling to O
2is through a ﬂavin
that is reduced by the NADH or NAD(P)H donor ( Madi-
gan et al., 2003 ). Although azo dyes are aromatic com-
pounds, their substituents containing mainly nitro and
sulfonic groups, are quite recalcitrant to aerobic bacterial
degradation ( Claus et al., 2002 ). This fact is probably
related either to the electron-withdrawing nature of theazo bond and their resistance to oxygenases attack, orbecause oxygen is a more eﬀective electron acceptor, there-fore having more preference for reducing equivalents thanthe azo dye ( Chung et al., 1992; Knackmuss, 1996 ). How-
ever, in the presence of speciﬁc oxygen-catalysed enzymes
called azo reductases, some aerobic bacteria are able to
reduce azo compounds and produce aromatic amines(Stolz, 2001 ). Examples of aerobic azo reductases were
found in Pseudomonas species strains K22 and KF46 ( Zim-
mermann et al., 1982, 1984 ). These enzymes, after puriﬁca-
tion, characterisation and comparison were shown to be
ﬂavin-free. The aerobic azo reductases were able to useboth NAD(P)H and NADH as cofactors and reductivelycleaved not only the carboxylated growth substrates ofthe bacteria but also the sulfonated structural analogues.Recently, Blumel and Stolz (2003) cloned and character-
ized the genetic code of the aerobic azo reductase fromPagmentiphaga kullae K24. This strain was able to grow
with the carboxylated azo compound 1-(4
0-carboxypheny-
lazo)-4-naphtol as a sole source of carbon and energy. Fur-thermore, the gene encoded a protein with a molecularweight of 20,557 Da, having conserved a putativeNAD(P)H-binding site in the amino-terminal region.
4.1.2. Fungi
The capacity of fungi to reduce azo dyes is related to the
formation of exoenzymes such as peroxidases and phenol-oxidases. Peroxidases are hemoproteins that catalyse reac-tions in the presence of hydrogen peroxide ( Duran et al.,
2002). Lignin and manganese peroxidases have a similar
reaction mechanism that starts with the enzyme oxidation
by H
2O2to an oxidized state during their catalytic cycle.
Afterwards, in a mechanism involving two successive elec-tron transfers, substrates such as azo dyes reduce theenzyme to its original form ( Stolz, 2001 ). Eighteen fungal
strains able to degrade lignocellulosic material or ligninderivatives were tested with the azo dyes Reactive Orange96, Reactive Violet 5 and Reactive Black 5. Only the strains
ofBjerkandera adusta ,Trametes versicolor and Phanero-
chaete chrysosporium were able to decolourise all azo dyes
(Heinﬂing et al., 1997 ). Although lignin peroxidases are
able to oxidize both phenolic and non-phenolic aromaticcompounds, manganese peroxidases must convert Mn
2+
to Mn3+in order to oxidize phenolic compounds ( Glenn
et al., 1986 ). Phenoloxidases, which can be divided into tyr-
osinases and laccases, are oxidoreductases that can catalyse
the oxidation of phenolic and other aromatic compounds
without the use of cofactors ( Duran et al., 2002 ). LaccasesTable 3

ADMI tristimulus The ADMI colour value provides a true watercolour measure, which is independent of hue. Depending on the number of
wavelengths chosen to calculate the ADMI value, this method can be diﬀerentiated in 3 (WL) ADMI, i.e. the transmittance is
recorded at 590, 540 and 438 nm; or 31 (WL) ADMI, i.e. the transmittance is determined each 10 nm in the range of 400–
700 nm
Spectra record The complete spectrum is recorded in which the entire spectrum, or a part of it, can be used for comparison. A modiﬁed
method has been suggested in which areas beneath an extinction curve represent the colour intensity, being expressed as space
units
Before measuring colour, the turbidity of the wastewater sample must be removed and the pH must be adjusted to 7.6.A.B. dos Santos et al. / Bioresource Technology 98 (2007) 2369–2385 2373are copper-containing enzymes that have a very broad sub-
strate speciﬁcity with respect to electron donors, e.g. dyes(Abadulla et al., 2000 ). However, despite the fact that lac-
cases from T. versicolor ,Polyporus pinisitus andMycelioph-
thora thermophila were found to decolourise anthraquinone
and indigoid-based dyes at high rates, the azo dye Direct
Red 29 (Congo Red) was a very poor substrate for laccases
(Claus et al., 2002 ).Chivukula and Renganathan (1995)
cited that the azo dye must be electron-rich to be suscepti-ble to oxidation by laccase of Pyricularia oryzae . This situ-
ation is suitable for the generation of a phenoxy radical,with consequent azo bond cleavage, and the release ofmolecular nitrogen ( Fig. 3 ). The addition of redox media-
tors has been shown to further extend the substrate speci-
ﬁcity of laccases with regard to several dye classes,
although redox mediators can also be formed from laccaseoxidation of phenolic azo dyes ( Li et al., 1999; Soares et al.,
2001; Claus et al., 2002 ).
4.2. Biological colour removal by strictly anaerobes or
facultative microorganisms incubated under anaerobic
conditions
Under anaerobic conditions a low redox potential
(</C050 mV) can be achieved, which is necessary for the
eﬀective decolourisation of dyes ( Beydilli et al., 1998;
Bromley-Challenor et al., 2000 ). Colour removal under
anaerobic conditions is also referred as dye reduction in
which literature mostly covers the biochemistry of azo
dye reduction. The azo bond cleavage –N @N– involves
a transfer of four-electrons (reducing equivalents), whichproceeds through two stages at the azo linkage. In eachstage two electrons are transferred to the azo dye, whichacts as a ﬁnal electron acceptor:

ðHydrazo intermediate Þ
ðR1–HN–NH–R2Þþ2e/C0þ2Hþ!R1–NH 2þR2–NH 2
ðReductive cleavage of the azo bond Þ
The exact mechanism of azo dye reduction, whether
occurring intracellularly or extracellularly, is still a subjectof investigation, as is the role of biogenic intracellularwater-soluble electron carriers such as ﬂavins. Reducedﬂavins can act as an electron shuttle from nicotinamideadenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-dependent ﬂa-
voproteins to azo dye as electron acceptor ( Gingell and
Walker, 1971 ). Intracellular azo dye reduction cannot be
responsible for the conversion of all types of azo dyes, espe-cially for sulfonated azo dyes, which have limited mem-brane permeability ( Stolz, 2001 ).Kudlich et al. (1997)
demonstrated an increase on colour removal rates of sulfo-nated azo dyes by cell free-extracts, as well as after additionof toluene, i.e. a membrane-active compound which
increases cell lysis, thus showing the limited membrane per-
meability of this type of dye. The current hypothesis is thatazo dye reduction mostly occurs by extracellular or mem-
brane-bond enzymes ( Stolz, 2001 ). Reduced cytoplasmatic
cofactors such as reduced ﬂavins do not contribute to thechemical dye reduction due to their inability to cross livingcell membranes ( Russ et al., 2000 ). However, cell fraction-
ation experiments demonstrated that a quinone reductaseactivity located in the cell membranes enhanced the reduc-tive decolourisation of a sulfonated azo compound, and
no dye cross-membrane transport was required ( Kudlich
et al., 1997 ). Recently, a NADH-dependent lawsone reduc-

colialso showed the capacity for azo dye reduction ( Rau
and Stolz, 2003 ).
4.2.1. Biological and chemical reductive decolourisation
The reductive decolourisation of azo dyes under anaer-
obic conditions is a combination of both biological and
chemical mechanisms. The biological contribution can be
divided in specialised enzymes called azo reductases, whichare present in bacteria that are able to grow using only azodye as a carbon and energy source. However, up to datethere is no clear evidence of anaerobic azo reductase; ornon-speciﬁc enzymes that catalyse the reduction of a widerange of electron-withdrawing contaminants, including
azo dyes ( Stolz, 2001 ). Thus, a co-metabolic reaction is
probably the main mechanism of dye reduction ( Fig. 4 ),
in which the reducing equivalents or reduced cofactors likeNADH, NAD(P)H, FMNH
2and FADH 2acting as sec-
ondary electron donor, channel electrons to cleave theazo bond ( Gingell and Walker, 1971 ).
Thechemical contribution to the reductive decolourisa-
tion of azo dyes under anaerobic conditions may involve
biogenic reductants like sulphide, cysteine, ascorbate or
Fe
2+(Yoo, 2002; Van der Zee et al., 2003 ). Particularly
for sulphide, it can be formed by sulphate reduction inanaerobic bioreactors. Therefore, there will be a competi-tion between sulphate and dye to become the terminal elec-tron acceptor of the reducing equivalents. Van der Zee
et al. (2003) observed that diﬀerent sulphate concentrations
did not have an adverse eﬀect on the reduction of RR2 in
either batch assays or reactor experiments. The authors
concluded that sulphate, even present at concentrationsup to 60 mM, did not obstruct the transfer of electron tothe azo dye. However, any noticeable eﬀect of sulphatewas veriﬁed on the dye removal eﬃciency in the labexperiment. In another investigation on colour removal,Albuquerque et al. (2005) used an anaerobic–aerobic
sequencing batch reactor fed with sulphate (0.35 mM).
The results indicated that the decolourisation capacity
was not improved while testing the dye Acid Orange 7,even though a sulphate reducing microbial populationwas established. Therefore, for a real perspective applica-tion, the contribution of sulphide generated by sulphatereduction seems to be negligible, and therefore the colourremoval is mainly due to biological processes.
Fig. 5 shows the electron ﬂow preference in the presence
of diﬀerent redox couples involved in biological processes.Thus, oxygen is a more eﬀective electron acceptor than azo
dyes, which justify the low decolourisation rates (10–30%)under aerobic conditions.
Nevertheless, either by using pure cultures or granular
sludge under anaerobic conditions, literature reports poorreductive decolourisation with speciﬁc dyes ( Brown and
DeVito, 1993; Van der Zee et al., 2001b; Dos Santoset al., 2005b,c ). Furthermore, the rates are extremely
dependent on the type of dye, in which the azo dyes gener-
ally present the highest rates of decolourisation. On theother hand, anthraquinone and phthalocyanine dyes areshown to be rather recalcitrant ( Dos Santos et al., 2005a;
Lee and Pavlostathis, 2004; Lee et al., 2005, 2006 ). Another
drawback is that some dyes are quite toxic to the anaerobicmicroorganisms, which in some cases, may lead to a per-manent loss of the methanogenic activity even for low
dye concentrations ( Brown and Laboureur, 1983a; Van
der Zee et al., 2001a; Fontenot et al., 2003; Van der Zeeand Villaverde, 2005; Lee et al., 2006 ). For instance, the
inhibitory concentration of RB19, exerting 50% reductionin methanogenic activity (IC-value), was 55 mg/l at 30 /C176C
(Dos Santos et al., 2005a ).
Table 4 shows the decolourisation of some dyes by using
anaerobic granular sludge under mesophilic conditions. It
is important to mention that a sound comparison among
investigations is extremely diﬃcult because of the diﬀer-ences in type and concentrations of dyes, sludge sourceand concentrations, electron donor, the way of calculatingthe decolourisation rates, etc.
4.2.2. Reductive decolourisation of azo dyes in the presence
of redox mediators
Redox mediators are compounds that accelerate the
electron transfer from a primary electron donor to a termi-
nal electron acceptor, which may increase the reaction rates

Dos Santos, 2005 ). Redox mediators have shown to be
eﬀective not only for reductive decolourisation, but alsofor the reductive transformation of many contaminantssuch as iron ( Lovley et al., 1998 ), nitroaromatics ( Dunni-
vant et al., 1992 ), polyhalogenated compounds ( O’Lough-
lin et al., 1999 ) and radionuclides ( Fredrickson et al.,
2000). Recently it was found that during the aerobic degra-
dation of naphthalene-2-sulfonate (2NS) by Sphingomonas
xenophaga strain BN6, quinoid redox mediators were pro-
duced, which mediated the reduction of azo dye underanaerobic conditions ( Keck et al., 2002 ). Flavin-based
compounds like FAD, FMN and riboﬂavin, as well as qui-none-based compounds like AQS, AQDS and lawsone,
have been extensively reported as redox mediators during
azo dye reduction ( Semde ´et al., 1998; Cervantes et al.,
2000; Rau et al., 2002a; Field and Brady, 2003; Dos Santoset al., 2004a, 2005b; Encinas-Yocupicio et al., 2006 ).
Reductive decolourisation of azo dyes in the presence ofredox mediators occurs in two distinct steps, the ﬁrst stepbeing a non-speciﬁc enzymatic mediator reduction, andthe second step being a chemical reoxidation of the media-
tor by the azo dyes ( Fig. 6 )(Keck et al., 1997 ).Theoretically, feasible redox mediators for biological
azo dye reduction must have redox potentials betweenthe half reactions of the azo dye and the primary electrondonor ( Van der Zee et al., 2003 ). Unfortunately, the stan-
dard redox potential ðE
0
0Þfor most azo dyes is unknown,
but this information can be obtained by using polarogra-
phy. In a screening of redox potential values for diﬀerent
azo dyes, it was found that E0
0values are generally between
/C00.430 and /C00.180 V ( Dubin and Wright, 1975 ).Rau et al.
(2002a,b) cite that the NAD(P)H cofactor, which has the
lowest E0
0value of /C00.320 V, seems to set the limits of
redox mediators application. The reason for this is thatmediators with a more negative E
0
0value will not be
reduced by the cells, and mediators with E0
0greater than
/C00.05 V will not eﬃciently reduce the azo bond at high
rates. Fig. 7 shows the E0
0values for both quinone-based
and non-quinone-based redox mediators.
The standard redox potential value ðE0
0Þis a good indi-
cation of a compound capacity to function as a redoxmediator. However, apparently other factors are of impor-tance as well since diﬀerent decolourisation rates in thepresence of mediators with similar E
0
0values have been
reported, and similar decolourisation rates with mediators

instance, Brown (1981) tested the polymeric nitro dye Poly

0
0of methyl viologen is much lower than that of benzyl
viologen, i.e. /C00.440 V and /C00.360 V, respectively ( Fig. 7 ).
Walker and Ryan (1971) postulated that decolourisation
rates are related to the electron density in the azo bondregion. They suggested that colour removal rates wouldincrease by lowering the electron density in the azo linkage.Therefore, the use of redox mediators would not only tendto accelerate the transfer of reducing equivalents to the ter-minal electron acceptor, i.e. the azo dye, but also to mini-mize the steric hindrance of the dye molecule ( Bragger
et al., 1997; Moir et al., 2001 ) and to decrease the acti-
vation energy of the chemical reaction ( Dos Santos,
2005). Thus, in estimating the theoretical decolourisation
rates by using speciﬁc redox mediators, diﬀerences in elec-tro-chemical factors between mediator and azo dye shouldalso be considered.
4.2.3. Microbiological aspects of the reductive
decolourisation of azo dyes
4.2.3.1. Pure cultures. The literature extensively reports the
use of pure cultures ( Table 5 ), either whole cells or speciﬁc
enzymes, for a better insight of the anaerobic azo dyereduction mechanisms, which are not fully understoodyet ( Stolz, 2001; Pearce et al., 2003, 2006; Dos Santos
et al., 2006b ).
Microbial decolourisation requires an unspeciﬁc enzy-
matic capacity ubiquitously found in a wide diversity of
microorganisms ( Chung and Stevens, 1993 ). This has been
mainly demonstrated with microorganisms present in theintestine such as Clostridium ,Salmonella ,Bacillus ,Eubacte-
rium andEscherichia coli , which are able to reduce the dyes
ingested through food, drugs and cosmetics ( Brown and
DeVito, 1993; Rau et al., 2002b; Chen et al., 2004 ). The
understanding of azo dye reduction mechanisms is impor-
tant not only under a biotechnological approach toward
the use of biological processes for decolourisation, but alsounder a medical approach to have an insight into how theintestinal microﬂora metabolites the ingested azo dyes(Brown and DeVito, 1993; Semde ´et al., 1998 ). Azo dyes
are converted into aromatic amines because of both thepresence of microﬂora and the anaerobic condition foundin the human intestine. Aromatic amines present a muta-
genic and carcinogenic character much higher than their
precursor azo dyes ( Weisburger, 2002 ). Therefore, a lot
of eﬀort has been made in the production of compounds,which are resistant to these reductive transformations.Another approach has been investigated in the use of azopolymers that would be insoluble in the upper gastrointes-tinal track, but susceptible to degradation on the colon,acting as an oral colon-speciﬁc drug delivery system
(Bragger et al., 1997; Rau et al., 2002b ). In this review
we focus on the biotechnological approach of azo dyereduction.4.2.3.2. Granular sludge. Even though anaerobic azo dye
reduction could be readily achieved with diﬀerent microor-ganisms, there is no strain reported so far that is able todecolourise a broad range of azo dyes. Therefore, the useof a speciﬁc strain or enzymes on reductive decolourisationdoes not make much sense in treating textile wastewater,
which is composed of many kinds of dyes ( Laszlo, 2000 ).
The use of mixed cultures such as anaerobic granularsludge, which is composed of stable microbial pellets witha high activity, is probably a more logic alternative. Diﬀer-ent reactor conﬁgurations like the widely used upﬂowanaerobic sludge bed (UASB) system and expanded granu-lar sludge bed (EGSB) system, are used to immobilize highconcentrations of biomass ( Lettinga et al., 1980; Lettinga,
1995; van Lier et al., 2001 ). Indeed, the diﬀerent microbial
consortia present in anaerobic granular sludge can carryout tasks that no individual pure culture can undertakesuccessfully ( Nigam et al., 1996; Pearce et al., 2003 ).
However, little is known about the microbiological
aspects of the reductive decolourisation of azo dyes withanaerobic consortia commonly found in wastewater treat-ment plants, although the applicability of the cost-eﬀective
high-rate anaerobic reactors for azo dye reduction has been
well demonstrated ( Cervantes et al., 2001; Dos Santos
et al., 2003, 2004b, 2006b ). A very complete review on bio-
reactor studies in lab scale for dye decolourisation wasrecently published elsewhere ( Van der Zee and Villaverde,
2005). However, literature lacks decolourisation studies
conducted in full scale. Frijters et al. (2006) reported a suc-cess example in Nijverdal (The Netherlands) of a combined
anaerobic/aerobic treatment of a textile wastewater con-
taining both soluble and insoluble dyes. Eﬃciencies ofabout 80–95% on colour removal were found, in whichthe anaerobic bioreactor was the main responsible indecolourising and detoxifying the textile wastewater.
As previously explained, the reductive decolourisation
of azo dyes by using methanogenic anaerobic granularsludge is very likely controlled by a co-metabolic reaction
in the presence of diﬀerent electron donors, in which the
azo dye is the terminal electron acceptor of the reducedcofactors ( Dos Santos, 2005 ). Thus, the reducing equiva-
lents are formed during the conversion of the primary elec-
tron donor, i.e. the organic matter, during the diﬀerentsteps of carbon ﬂow under anaerobic conditions ( Fig. 8 ).
According to Gujer and Zehnder (1983) , the organic
matter is initially hydrolysed; namely, enzymes produced
by fermentative bacteria hydrolyse complex molecules such
as proteins, polysaccharides, nucleic acid and fats into theircorresponding monomers, which are amino acids, sugarsand long chain fatty acids. Afterwards, these monomersare fermented to reduced organic compounds like shortchain fatty acids, alcohols and lactate in a step called acido-genesis. Subsequently, these acids can either be convertedinto H
2/CO 2by hydrogen-forming microorganisms or into
acetate by acetate-forming microorganisms. Acetate can
also be formed via H 2/CO 2pathway in a step called homo-
acetogenesis. Finally, the ﬁnal product methane/CO 2can2378 A.B. dos Santos et al. / Bioresource Technology 98 (2007) 2369–2385be formed in the methanogenesis step. Methanogens are
able to directly use substrates like H 2, acetate, formate
and methanol to produce methane.
Reductive decolourisation of azo dyes is extremely
dependent on the type of primary electron donor. Acetateand other volatile fatty acids are normally poor electrondonors, whereas ethanol, glucose, H
2/CO 2and formate
are more eﬀective electron donors for dye reduction ( Tan
et al., 1999; Dos Santos et al., 2003, 2005b; Pearce et al.,2006).Donlon et al. (1997) reported that interspecies
hydrogen resulting from the oxidation of substrates such
as butyrate, propionate, and ethanol could provide themedium with reducing equivalents, and thus stimulation
of the nitrophenol reduction. In the latter work, the directmethane precursors acetate and methanol did not stimulate
the nitrophenol reduction rates. Similar results were also
reported during the reductive dechlorination of carbon tet-rachloride (CT) by anaerobic granular sludge in which ace-tate and methanol were marginally utilized to support CTdechlorination ( Cervantes et al., 2004 ). The reason why
acetate, methanol and VFAs are poor electron donors forreductive biotransformations is not clear yet. Nevertheless,a possible explanation is that the acetoclastic methanogens
do not participate eﬀectively on dye reduction, and theTable 5

and hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Thus, probablyVFAs are poor electron donors because they are mainly
converted to acetate due to the thermodynamics reasons.
In fact, there will be a competition for reducing equivalentsbetween dye reducers and other microorganisms during allthe steps of organic matter conversion under anaerobicconditions ( Dos Santos et al., 2006b ).
Dos Santos et al. (2006b) found that in the absence of the
redox mediator riboﬂavin, the eﬀect of the methanogenicinhibitor BES on azo dye reduction was negligible with
the methanogenic substrates acetate and methanol. In con-
trast, remarkable results were obtained when hydrogen andformate were included as electron donors; the rates ofdecolourisation were considerably higher (up to 1.7-fold)in BES-supplemented bottles compared to non-inhibitedcontrols. They concluded that apparently, the inclusion ofBES stimulated azo dye reduction by chemically out-com-peting methanogenesis for the reducing equivalents avail-
able in hydrogen- and formate-supplemented cultures,
and therefore acetate- and methanol utilizing methanogensdo not play a role in the reductive decolourisation. Theeﬀect of BES with hydrogen as the electron donor is inagreement with the conclusions of Field et al. (2004) , whostudied the reduction of arsenate by a methanogenic con-
sortium. In this study, methanogens and arsenate reducerswere probably competing for the same electrons, likely ina similar reduction mechanism as we found for dyereduction.
The conversion of the electron donors, e.g. ethanol, glu-
cose, used for both dye reduction and methanogenesis is
only maintained if there is equilibrium among the syn-trophic group of microorganisms present in the bioreactor(Fig. 8 ). The degree of dependence among these micro-
organisms varies considerably ( Schink, 2002 ). Despite the
fact that the last members in the bacterial food chainare dependent on the earlier ones, e.g. interdependencebetween methanogens and acetogens, they may be extre-
mely important for the ﬁrst organisms in the consumption
chain by removing metabolic products ( Schink, 1997 ).Dos
Santos et al. (2005a) observed that the anthraquinone dye
RB19 was mainly toxic to the acetate-utilising methano-gens, whereas acidogens were not aﬀected by the dye toxi-city. In another study, Lee et al. (2006) found high and
moderate decolourisation extend for the anthraquinone(over 84%) and phthalocyanine (49–66%) dyes, respec-
tively, after prolonged incubations under anoxic/anaerobic
conditions with diﬀerent carbon sources, despite the inhibi-tion of the methanogenic activity. Therefore, the feasibilityof coupling, in the same bioreactor, dye reduction andcomplete electron donor conversion into CH
4must be
carefully attempted.
4.3. Non-biological colour removal
4.3.1. Physical–chemical methods
In physical–chemical methods coagulant agents like fer-
ric salts or aluminium polychloride are used to form ﬂocswith the dyes, which are then separated by ﬁltration or sed-imentation. Polyelectrolyte can also be dosed during theﬂocculation phase to improve the ﬂocs settleability ( Vande-
vivere et al., 1998 ). The coagulation–ﬂocculation method is
one of the most widely used processes in textile wastewater
treatment plants in many countries such as Germany and
France. It can be used either as a pre-treatment, post-treat-ment, or even as a main treatment system ( Ga¨hr et al.,
1994; Marmagne and Coste, 1996 ).Marmagne and Coste
(1996) reported that coagulation–ﬂocculation methods
were successfully applied for colour removal of sulphurand disperse dyes, whereas acid, direct, reactive and vatdyes presented very low coagulation–ﬂocculation capacity.
On top of the problem of low colour removal eﬃciency
with some dyes, physical–chemical methods demand largechemicals inputs, and produce high volumes of pollutedsludge, which then must be treated ( Robinson et al.,
2001; Anjaneyulu et al., 2005 ).
4.3.2. Chemical methods
Chemical oxidation typically involves the use of an oxi-
dising agent such as ozone (O
3), hydrogen peroxide
(H2O2) and permanganate (MnO 4) to change the chemical
Fig. 8. Conversion of complex organic matter in methanogenic anaerobic
reactors (adapted from Gujer and Zehnder (1983) ).2380 A.B. dos Santos et al. / Bioresource Technology 98 (2007) 2369–2385composition of a compound or a group of compounds, e.g.
dyes ( Metcalf and Eddy, 2003 ). Among these oxidants,
ozone is the most widely used because of its high reactivitywith many dyes, usually providing good colour removaleﬃciencies ( Alaton et al., 2002 ). In a process called selective
oxidation, ozone can be designed in such a way that only –
N@N– bond scission occurs, and biodegradable com-
pounds remain non-oxidised ( Boncz, 2002 ). However,
disperse dyes and those insoluble in water represent a draw-back for the process, as well as the high cost of ozone ( Has-
san and Hawkyard, 2002; Anjaneyulu et al., 2005 ). The
usual low eﬃciency of both colour and COD removals ofconventional chemical oxidation techniques have beenovercome by the development of the so-called advanced
oxidation processes (AOP). In this process, oxidizing agents
such as O
3and H 2O2are used with catalysts (Fe, Mn and
TiO 2), either in the presence or absence of an irradiation
source ( Anjaneyulu et al., 2005 ). Consequently, an improve-
ment in the generation and use of the free hydroxyl radical(HO
/C5) is obtained, which may represent a rate increase of
one to several orders of magnitude compared with normaloxidants in the absence of a catalyst ( Ince and Tezcanli,
1999).Table 6 gives an indication of the oxidative power
of the hydroxyl radical based on the electrochemicaloxidation potential (EOP) capacity compared with otheroxidants.
At present, many diﬀerent combinations of these AOP
have been investigated for colour removal, all of whichare capable of producing the free hydroxyl radical (HO).The ﬁrst example is a reaction called the Fenton reaction ,
in which hydrogen peroxide is added in an acid solution
(pH 2–3) containing Fe
2+ions:
Fe2þþH2O2!Fe3þþHOþHO/C0ð1Þ
In comparison with ozonation, this method is relatively
cheap and also presents high COD removal and decolouri-sation eﬃciencies ( Van der Zee, 2002 ). The main process
drawbacks are the high sludge generation due to the ﬂoccu-
lation of reagents and dye molecules ( Robinson et al.,
2001), as well as the need for decreasing the bulk pH to
acidic conditions. Hassan and Hawkyard (2002) reported
that a pre-ozonation of coloured wastewaters prior toFenton reaction not only considerably accelerated the
overall colour removal rates, but also decreased the sludgegeneration.
InH
2O2/UV process HO radicals are formed when
water-containing H 2O2is exposed to UV light, normally
in the range of 200–280 nm ( Metcalf and Eddy, 2003 ).
The H 2O2photolysis follows the reaction:
H2O2þUV ðorhv;k/C25200–280 nm Þ!HO/C5þHO/C5ð2Þ
This process is the most widely used AOP technology for
the treatment of hazardous and refractory pollutants pres-
ent in wastewaters, mainly because no sludge is formed and
a high COD removal in a short retention time is achieved(Safarzadeh et al., 1997 ). Additionally, it has been success-
fully applied for colour removal. For instance, more than95% decolourisation was achieved in treating reactive,basic, acid and direct dyes at pH 5, whereas disperse andvat dyes were only partially decolourised ( Yang et al.,
1998). A comparative study between ozone and H
2O2/
UV was carried out in treating a concentrated reactive dye-
bath from a textile factory. The H 2O2/UV system presented
decolourisation rates close to those rates obtained withozone but with a lower cost ( Alaton et al., 2002 ). In some
cases however, the H
2O2/UV process presents low COD
and colour removal eﬃciency due to ineﬃcient use of UVlight (mainly for highly coloured wastewaters) ( Moraes
et al., 2000 ), or because of the low molar extinction coeﬃ-
cient of H
2O2(speciﬁc oxidation capacity), requiring high
dosages of the latter.
The UV-based methods in the presence of a catalyst, e.g.
a semiconductive material such as TiO 2, have also shown
to distinctly enhance colour removal ( So et al., 2002; Grze-
chulska and Morawski, 2002 ). Thus, diﬀerent combina-
tions such as ozone/TiO 2, ozone/TiO 2/H2O2and TiO 2/
H2O2have been investigated, but they are enormously
inﬂuenced by the type of dye, dye concentration and pH
(Galindo et al., 2000 ). Recently, the utilization of solar
technologies instead of UV-based methods has beenattracting attention ( Wang, 2000 ).
4.3.3. Physical methods
Filtration methods such as ultraﬁltration, nanoﬁltration
and reverse osmosis have been used for water reuse andchemical recovery. In the textile industry these ﬁltrationmethods can be used for both ﬁltering and recycling notonly pigment-rich streams, but also mercerising andbleaching wastewaters. The speciﬁc temperature and chem-
ical composition of the wastewater determine the type and
porosity of the ﬁlter to be applied ( Porter, 1997 ). The main
drawbacks of membrane technology are the high invest-ment costs, the potential membrane fouling, and theproduction of a concentrated dyebath which needs to betreated ( Robinson et al., 2001 ). The recovery of concen-
trates from membranes, e.g. recovery of the sodiumhydroxide used in the mercerising step or sizing agents such
as polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), can attenuate the treatment
costs ( Porter, 1997 ). Water reuse from dyebath eﬄuentsTable 6

However, a coagulation and micro-ﬁltration pre-treatmentwas necessary to avoid membrane fouling ( Vandevivere
et al., 1998 ). A very good option would be to consider an
anaerobic pre-treatment followed by aerobic and mem-
brane post-treatments, in order to recycle the water.
Adsorption methods for colour removal are based on the
high aﬃnity of many dyes for adsorbent materials. Decolo-urisation by adsorption is inﬂuenced by some physical–chemical factors like dye-adsorbent interactions, adsorbentsurface area, particle size, temperature, pH and contacttime ( Mattioli et al., 2002; Anjaneyulu et al., 2005 ). The
main criteria for the selection of an adsorbent should be
based on characteristics such as high aﬃnity and capacity
for target compounds and the possibility of adsorbentregeneration ( Karcher et al., 2001 ). Activated carbon
(AC) is the most common adsorbent and can be very eﬀec-tive with many dyes ( Walker and Weatherley, 1997 ). How-
ever, its eﬃciency is directly dependent upon the type ofcarbon material used and the wastewater characteristics,i.e. types of dyes present in the stream ( Robinson et al.,
2001). Additionally, AC is relatively expensive and has to
be regenerated oﬀsite with losses of about 10% in the ther-mal regeneration process. In order to decrease the adsor-bent losses during regeneration, new adsorbent materialshave been tested for their ability for on-site regeneration.Karcher et al. (2001) studied alternative materials such as
zeolites, polymeric resins, ion exchangers and granulatedferric hydroxide. It was found that zeolites and micropo-
rous resins were unsuitable due to their low sorption capac-
ity. Although the ion exchangers provided good sorptioncapacity, regeneration was sometimes diﬃcult. A numberof low-cost adsorbent materials like peat, bentonite clayand ﬂy ash, have been investigated on colour removal(Ramakrishna and Viraraghavan, 1997; Anjaneyulu
et al., 2005 ). However, the eﬃciency of these materials var-
ied with the dye class. For instance, ﬂy ash presented high
sorption aﬃnity for acid dyes, whereas peat and bentonite
presented high aﬃnity for basic dyes. Table 7 shows theadvantages and drawbacks of some non-biological decolo-
urisation processes applied to textile wastewaters.
5. Conclusions
All the decolourisation methods described in this review
have advantages and drawbacks, and their selection willdepend on the wastewater characteristics like class andconcentration of dye, pH, salinity and toxic compounds.Compared to individual bacterial cells or speciﬁc enzymes,anaerobic colour removal by granular sludge as a pre-treat-ment for coloured wastewaters from dyebath and rinsingsteps seems to be a very attractive technology. Moreover,
the use of redox mediators and/or thermophilic treatment
to accelerate decolourisation rates in bioreactors is verypromising, while ways to immobilize redox mediators inbioreactors or their recovery when continuously dosed,still represents a challenge.
Eﬃcient post-treatment methods, e.g. aerobic biological
post-treatment, ozone and fenton reagents, for the com-plete mineralization of the aromatic amines, which are
formed in the anaerobic step, must be utilized. Therefore,
the treatment of textile wastewater either to guaranteethe emission requirements or to close the water cycleshould be composed of a sequence of treatments, and eachscenario should be analysed individually.
