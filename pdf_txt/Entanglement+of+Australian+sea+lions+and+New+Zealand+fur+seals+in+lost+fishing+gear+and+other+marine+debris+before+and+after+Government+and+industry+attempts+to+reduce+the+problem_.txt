Abstract
In recent years, Australian governments and ﬁshing industry associations have developed guiding principles aimed at reducing
the impact of ﬁshing on non-target species and the benthos and increasing community awareness of their eﬀorts. To determinewhether they reduced seal entanglement in lost ﬁshing gear and other marine debris, we analysed Australian sea lion and New
Zealand fur seal entanglement data collected from Kangaroo Island, South Australia. Contrary to our expectations, we found that
entanglement rates did not decrease in recent years. The Australian sea lion entanglement rate (1.3% in 2002) and the New Zealandfur seal entanglement rate (0.9% in 2002) are the third and fourth highest reported for any seal species. Australian sea lions were
most frequently entangled in monoﬁlament gillnet that most likely originated from the shark ﬁshery, which operates in the region
where sea lions forage––south and east of Kangaroo Island. In contrast, New Zealand fur seals were most commonly entangled inloops of packing tape and trawl net fragments suspected to be from regional rock lobster and trawl ﬁsheries. Based on recent
entanglement studies, we estimate that 1478 seals die from entanglement each year in Australia. We discuss remedies such as
education programs and government incentives that may reduce entanglements./C2112004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
The problem of plastic in the marine environment is
of increasing concern because millions of tons of plasticenters the ocean each year (Pruter, 1987; Slip and Bur-ton, 1991; Derraik, 2002). Fishing gear, packaging
materials, convenience items and raw plastics comprise
most of the plastic in the ocean (Pruter, 1987; Derraik,2002). Major sources of plastic in the ocean are fromﬁshing vessels, ship waste, drains, rivers and litter frompeople at beaches. Marine debris is concentrated bycurrents and waves at oceanic convergence fronts and incoastal waters around cities (Carr, 1987; Day and Shaw,1987; Derraik, 2002). As oceanic convergence fronts areup- or down-welling regions and coastal waters are often
estuaries, these very productive ecosystems often com-bine high densities of marine life and debris (Carr,1987).
Plastic has replaced natural ﬁbres in the ﬁshing
industry over the past 35 years due to its light weight,
low production cost and physical and biological dura-
bility (Henderson, 2001). The use of durable plastic netsand ropes has increased eﬃciency of ﬁshing operationsas less time is spent repairing equipment made fromnatural ﬁbres. However, the widespread use of plastic inthe ﬁshing industry has resulted in considerable quan-tities of ﬁshing debris in oceans and on beaches (Hen-derson, 2001).
The impact of debris on marine wildlife popula-
tions is diﬃcult to document because animal popula-tions ﬂuctuate signiﬁcantly through time in response to

www.elsevier.com/locate/marpolbulMarine Pollution Bulletin 49 (2004) 33–42natural factors such as climate variation and prey avail-
ability (Fowler, 1987). However, the physical eﬀects thatplastic debris has on wildlife are well documented and agrowing body of evidence suggests plastic debris is a
signiﬁcant threat to some turtle and seal populations
(Carr, 1987; Fowler, 1987). The few studies that quan-tiﬁed the eﬀects of ﬂoating net fragments concluded theyare possibly as eﬀective at entangling and killing marinewildlife as operational nets (DeGrange and Newby,1980; Jones and Ferrero, 1985; Fowler et al., 1990). Awide diversity of marine animals become entangled inplastic debris, including ﬁsh (Stewart and Yochem,
1987; Jones, 1995; Cliﬀ et al., 2002), turtles (Carr, 1987),
seabirds (Schrey and Vauk, 1987; Piatt and Nettleship,1987), whales (Volgenau et al., 1995) and seals (Shaugh-nessy, 1980; Hofmeyr et al., 2002; Arnould and Croxall,1995). Fur seals and sea lions provide a means ofexamining the types of debris present in their foragingrange as many seals become entangled in debris andcarry it back to land around their necks. When entan-
gled seals haul out on land they can be observed, cap-
tured and the material removed for analysis.
The disposal of all plastics in Australian waters is
prohibited by the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of
Pollution from Ships )Act, 1983 . This Act implements the
provisions of Annex 5 of the International Conventionfor the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL),which was ratiﬁed in 1989, prohibiting the disposal of
plastic in international waters. Since ratiﬁcation,
entanglement rates of northern fur seals, Callorhinus
ursinus , have decreased (Fowler et al., 1994) but entan-
glement rates of Hawaiian monk seals, Monachus sch-
lauinslandi , have not changed (Henderson, 2001). In the
early 1990s, the Commission on the Conservation ofAntarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) suc-cessfully educated commercial ﬁshers about the eﬀects of
their plastic debris, resulting in most bait box packing
tape being cut before disposal around South Georgia(Arnould and Croxall, 1995). However, following theeducation campaign there was also a coincident reduc-tion in ﬁshing eﬀort in the region. As such, subsequentdecreases in the entanglement rates of Antarctic fur seals(Arctocephalus gazella ) were not solely attributed to
improved waste management by ﬁshers (Arnould and
Croxall, 1995). No studies were conducted in Australia
to determine whether these laws were eﬀective inreducing the impact of ﬁshing gear on marine animals.
In response to public concern regarding the impact of
commercial ﬁsheries on marine ecosystems the Com-monwealth Government developed two policies: theNational Policy on Fisheries Bycatch in late 1999 andthe Commonwealth Policy on Fisheries Bycatch in 2000.
The ﬁrst policy did not include ﬁshery-speciﬁc actions,
but the latter policy was implemented as Bycatch ActionPlans for each ﬁshery in early 2001. The Bycatch ActionPlans included aims, strategies and actions to ensurebycatch species were not adversely aﬀected by ﬁsheries
(AFMA, 2001b). ‘‘For the purpose of the Bycatch Ac-tion Plan and this Background Paper, bycatch refers tothat part of the catch which is discarded or which
interacts with the ﬁshing gear but does not reach the
deck. This is consistent with the Commonwealth Policyon Fisheries Bycatch, which deﬁnes bycatch as: by-catch ¼discards + interactions with gear ...Discards
and interactions with ﬁshing gear have been deﬁned inthe Commonwealth Policy on Fisheries Bycatch as: (1)that part of a ﬁsher’s catch which is returned to the seaeither because it has no commercial value or because
regulations preclude it being retained, (2) that part of
the catch that does not reach the deck of the ﬁshingvessel but is killed as a result of interaction with theﬁshing gear (including lost ﬁshing gear). This can bedescribed as unaccounted mortality resulting from ﬁsh-ing’’ (AFMA, 2001a). The sentiments of the BycatchAction Plans are mirrored in state government policiesand ﬁshing industry codes of conduct. Clearly, there is a
need for research to document levels of unaccounted
mortality.
This study presents data from observations of
entangled New Zealand fur seals ( Arctocephalus forsteri )
and Australian sea lions ( Neophoca cinerea ) ashore at
Kangaroo Island (36 /C17604
0S 137 /C176280E). Fur seals and sea
lions from these islands forage in regions that overlapwith several ﬁsheries managed by the Commonwealth
Government (Great Australian Bight trawl, gillnet hook
and trap, south east trawl and southern tuna and billﬁshﬁsheries) as well as ﬁsheries managed by state govern-ments (rock lobster, abalone and other marine ﬁshes)(Page unpublished data, Costa personal communica-tion). We describe the nature of the seal entanglements,determine their source where possible and estimateentanglement-related mortality for each species. Results
are discussed in the context of the eﬀectiveness of gov-
ernment and industry attempts to reduce unaccountedmortality.
2. Methods
2.1. Species
In Australia, fur seals and sea lions were intensively
hunted for their pelts in the early 19th century (Galeset al., 1994; Ling, 1999). Very small populations sur-vived on inaccessible islands and since the end of com-mercial sealing, numbers have increased (summarised inGoldsworthy et al., 2003). New Zealand fur seals arerecolonising islands throughout their former range
(Shaughnessy et al., 2002), however, this appears not to
be the case for Australian sea lions (Gales et al., 1994).Fur seals and sea lions are protected in Australia undertheEnvironment Protection and Biodiversity Conserva-34 B. Page et al. / Marine Pollution Bulletin 49 (2004) 33–42tion Act, 1999 and under State and Territory legislation.
Although seals are known to compete for commercialﬁsh species and sometimes damage ﬁshing nets, it isillegal to take, kill, injure or move seals. Entangled
Australian sea lions and New Zealand fur seals have
been reported from South Australia by Robinson andDennis (1988) and entanglement in man-made marinedebris was identiﬁed as a threatening process for seals inAustralian waters in Environment Australia’s ‘‘ActionPlan for Australian Seals’’ (Shaughnessy, 1999).
2.2. Study sites
Seals were observed at Seal Bay (Australian sea lions)
and in the Cape Gantheaume Conservation Park (NewZealand fur seals), both on the south coast of KangarooIsland, South Australia. The Australian sea lion popu-lation at Seal Bay has been stable since the study beganin 1987 (approximately 700 individuals, Shaughnessyunpublished data, Goldsworthy et al., 2003), while the
New Zealand fur seal population in the Cape Gan-
theaume Conservation Park (20 km east of Seal Bay,including Berris Point) has been increasing by about16% per annum since 1987 and currently numbers about8900 individuals (Shaughnessy and Dennis, 2002;Goldsworthy et al., 2003).
2.3. Data collection and analyses
Search eﬀort for entangled seals varied between years
and sites. At Cape Gantheaume, New Zealand fur sealswere monitored between 2.3 and 6.5 months per year(mean 4.6 months, SD 48 days) from 1989 to 1991 and2000 to 2002. For New Zealand fur seals we estimatedthe number of entangled seals that hauled out when thecolony was not monitored, from 1989 to 1991 and 2000
to 2002, following the model developed by Henderson
(2001), because both males and females of all ages havebeen shown to haul out throughout the year (Golds-worthy and Shaughnessy, 1994). For example, 40entangled seals were observed at Cape Gantheaume in2002 during 6 months (0.5 years) of monitoring, so theestimate for the number of entangled seals for the entireyear is 80 (i.e. 40/0.50). The colony was not monitored
from 1992 to 1999 so we did not estimate the number of
entanglements for this period. We did not extrapolatenumbers for Australian sea lions as approximately 80%of the colony at Seal Bay was observed daily (and theremainder monthly) since 1988.
For each observation of an entangled seal the loca-
tion, date and sex of the seal was recorded. The age ofentangled seals was estimated as one of ﬁve categories;
pups, juveniles, sub adult males, adult males or adult
females (as described in Goldsworthy and Shaughnessy,1994; Gales et al., 1994). When an entangled seal wascaptured or found dead the entangling material wasremoved and either identiﬁed and discarded or retained
for subsequent identiﬁcation by commercial ﬁshers andnet manufacturers. If an entangled seal was not capturedthe nature of the material was determined, using spot-
ting scopes or binoculars. Entanglements were classiﬁed
as life-threatening if they had worn through the skin andbecome embedded in the neck, as such entanglementsare unlikely to become detached (Fowler et al., 1990;Pemberton et al., 1992). Entanglement-related mortalitywas calculated based on the proportion of life-threat-ening entanglements observed. To avoid overestimationof entanglement rates, seals with scars caused by
entanglements were not included in this study unless
entangling material could be seen. Similarly, if entangledseals evaded capture and were subsequently observedthey were not double-counted.
Some seals were found entangled after possible direct
interactions with ﬁshing gear such as tuna longlines andshark gillnets. Two entanglement studies excluded theseinteractions as they assumed seals were cut free from
active ﬁsheries, rather than entangled in net fragments
(Stewart and Yochem, 1987; Henderson, 2001). We in-clude all such cases in this study because all entanglingmaterials, including longline hooks, were also foundwashed ashore (Page unpublished data).
Annual entanglement rates were calculated as pro-
portions of the number of seals in the resident popula-tion. Population sizes were estimated using models from
Goldsworthy et al. (2003), which multiply pup produc-
tion by 3.93 for Australian sea lions and 3.95 for NewZealand fur seals. Mann–Whitney U-tests (two-tailed)
were used to examine diﬀerences between entanglementrates before and after the implementation of BycatchAction Plans, to assess whether they reduced the impactof lost ﬁshing gear from Commonwealth ﬁsheries. Someof the entangling material is most likely from state
ﬁsheries so we analyse interactions for the same period
to enable comparison. Around this time state ﬁsheries(such as the rock lobster ﬁshery) implemented codes ofpractice to reduce the impact on the marine environment(Braund, 2000). The level of exact signiﬁcance was set at0.05 for Mann–Whitney U-tests. For New Zealand fur
seals, our sample size of four years before and two yearsafter the introduction of the Bycatch Action Plans was
too small to determine exact signiﬁcance of p<0:133.
However, levels of signiﬁcance are given to provide in-sight into observed trends.
3. Results
A trend of increasing numbers of entanglements in
recent years was apparent for New Zealand fur seals and
Australian sea lions around Kangaroo Island (Tables 1and 2, Figs. 1 and 2). Packing tape, netting and ropeaccounted for most of the material entangling seals. AtB. Page et al. / Marine Pollution Bulletin 49 (2004) 33–42 35the two colonies studied a total of 126 entangled seals
were observed (Tables 1 and 2), 61 (48%) of which weresuﬀering life-threatening injuries and ﬁve (4%) of whichwere dead. Sixty-ﬁve (52%) of the 126 seals were cap-tured and the material removed. Of the 61 seals thatavoided capture 59 (97%) were not resighted again,suggesting they died or the material became detached orperhaps they went elsewhere.
3.1. Australian sea lions
Thirty-ﬁve entangled sea lions were observed at Seal
Bay during the 15 year study (Table 1, Fig. 1). Contraryto our expectations, entangled sea lions were signiﬁ-cantly more common at Seal Bay from 2001 to 2002(n
1¼13,n2¼2,p¼0:019), increasing from an average
of 1.5 (SD ¼1.20, n¼20) per year before 2001 to 7.5
(SD¼2.12, n¼15) per year (Table 1). This represents
an increase in the annual entanglement rate (% of thetotal population per year) at Seal Bay, from 0.2% before2001 to 1.0% for 2001 and 1.3% for 2002.
Pups were the most frequently entangled age class
(54% of entanglements), with their incidence of entan-glement increasing signiﬁcantly from an average of 1.0(SD¼0.73) pups per year between 1988 and 2000 to 4.5
(SD¼2.12) pups per year from 2001 to 2002 ( n
1¼13,
n2¼2,p¼0:019, Fig. 1). Cases of entangled juveniles,
subadult males and adult females did not decrease in2001–2002 (juveniles: n
1¼13,n2¼2,p¼0:114; sub-
adult males: n1¼13,n2¼2,p¼0:571; adult females:
n1¼13,n2¼2,p¼0:476, Fig. 1). Only two (5% of
total) adult males were observed with entangle-
ments during the study, one in 1989 and one in 2002
(Fig. 1).
Interpretive Oﬃcers from the Department for Envi-
ronment and Heritage conducted daily checks of theMain Beach at the Seal Bay colony and removed mostentanglements (74%) from sea lions, ensuring entangle-ment-related mortality was minimal. We expect at least15 (43%) of the entangled sea lions would have died as
they were suﬀering life-threatening injuries when ob-
served.
Entangling material observed on sea lions included
monoﬁlament netting, trawl netting, packing tape, rope,ﬁshing line with hooks and a strip of car tyre inner-tube(Table 1). Monoﬁlament netting, of >15 cm diametermesh, was recorded on 19 (55%) sea lions and was themost common item in ﬁve of the 12 years when entan-Table 2

monoﬁlament netting entanglements increased signiﬁ-cantly following the introduction of the Bycatch ActionPlans ( n
1¼13,n2¼2,p¼0:038, Table 1). South and
southeast of Kangaroo Island, bottom set gillnets areused to catch school sharks ( Galeorhinus galeus ) and
gummy sharks ( Mustelus antarcticus ) in the gillnet, hook
and trap ﬁshery (Jones, 1995; AFMA, 2001a). The rel-
atively high incidence of monoﬁlament netting on Aus-
tralian sea lions contrasts with the low incidence ofentanglement reported by the ﬁshery to the AustralianFisheries Management Authority, ofone dead and twolive seals in 14,243 shots in 1998, and one dead seal in12,696 shots in 1999 (Shaughnessy et al., 2003). Thissuggests a low rate of reporting of entangled sea lions inlogbooks by shark ﬁshers or a high rate of net loss in the
ﬁshery. Industry representatives believe lost gear stops
ﬁshing within a short period of time because nets andlines become tangled on the bottom, covered in algaeand coral (AFMA, 2001a), in contrast with studies oflost nets (DeGrange and Newby, 1980; Jones and Fer-rero, 1985; Fowler et al., 1990).
Packing tape and trawl net entanglements were not
observed at Seal Bay until 1998 and 2000, respectively
(Table 1). At Seal Bay just four packing tape loops and
four trawl net fragments (each 11% of total) were ob-served during the 15 year study (Table 1). The incidenceof packing tape and trawl netting entanglements did not
decrease in 2001–2002 (packing: n
1¼13,n2¼2,p¼
0:381, trawl: n1¼13,n2¼2,p¼0:381). Around Kan-
garoo Island packing tape is commonly used to bundlefrozen bait, which is used to lure rock lobster, sharks,
and tuna (Jones, 1995). The ﬁve rope entanglements
(14% of total) at Seal Bay were most likely from regionalﬁsheries, however, only one of the entanglements wasidentiﬁed to a ﬁshery––a loop of rope commonly at-tached to ﬂoats on rock lobster pots.
3.2. New Zealand fur seals
Ninety-one entangled New Zealand fur seals were
observed at Cape Gantheaume and a further 104 wereestimated to have come ashore when the colony was notmonitored in the six years from 1989 to 1991 and 2000to 2002 (Table 2, Fig. 2). The highest number ofentanglements observed was during 2002 when 40 wererecorded in six months of monitoring (50% of the year).Despite the large increase in population size (from about
1800 in 1989 to about 8900 in 2002: Shaughnessy and
Dennis, 2002, Goldsworthy et al., 2003) the annualentanglement rate (% of the total population per year)increased from an average of 0.4% (SD ¼0.2%) per year
prior to 2001 to 0.9% (SD ¼0.1%) per year from 2001 to
2002, although the diﬀerence was not signiﬁcant ( n
1¼4,
n2¼2,p¼0:133). The entanglement rate in both 2001
and 2002 was 0.9%.
New Zealand fur seals of all ages were observed
entangled at Cape Gantheaume during the study (Fig.2). Entanglement rates increased for adult males (1989–2000: 0.01 to 2001–2002: 0.06%), females (0.02–0.10%),subadult males (0.07–0.16%), juveniles (0.23–0.45%) andpups (0.03–0.12%), although not signiﬁcantly (adultmales: n
1¼4,n2¼2,p¼0:133, females: n1¼4,n2¼2,
p¼0:133, subadult males: n1¼4,n2¼2,p¼1:00,
juveniles: n1¼4,n2¼2,p¼0:267, pups: n1¼4,n2¼
2,p¼0:267) (Fig. 2). Entangling material was removed
from 39 (45%) of the 86 New Zealand fur seals observedalive. Five (5%) entangled seals were found dead in thecolony and 46 (53%) of the 86 live seals had injuriesclassiﬁed as life-threatening.

fur seals included packing tape, trawl netting, rope fromrock lobster ﬂoats, other rope, plastic bags, a beach-washed rock lobster pot, ﬁshing line, a string of burst
balloons and a rubber o-ring (Table 2). Packing tape,
most likely from rock lobster vessels and/or shark ortuna longliners, was the most common entanglementand its relative incidence did not decrease in 2001 to2002 ( n
1¼4,n2¼2,p¼1:000) (Table 2). Trawl netting
entanglements increased from 0.05% prior to 2001 to0.27% during 2001–2002, although not signiﬁcantly(n
1¼4,n2¼2,p¼0:133) (Table 2). Around Kangaroo
Island trawling is conducted on the shelf and shelf
break, targeting mainly deep water ﬂathead ( Neoplaty-
cephalus conatus ) and Bight redﬁsh ( Centroberyx gerr-
ardi). Rope from rock lobster ﬂoats entangled 12 seals in
2001–2002. A rock lobster pot set just oﬀ the colonywashed ashore during high seas in May 2002. Four pupsbecame trapped in the pot while it was ashore anddrowned during the next high tide. Pieces of plastic bag
entangled six seals but they could not be deﬁnitively
sourced (Table 2). Monoﬁlament netting was removedfrom one seal and three seals had fragments of ﬁshingline with hooks attached (Table 2). One of the hookswas from a tuna longline and two were from recrea-tional ﬁsheries.
4. Discussion
The results of this study suggest most entangling
material found on Australian sea lions and New Zea-land fur seals originates from nearby ﬁshing activity.Similarly, entangling material found on Australian furseals ( A. pusillus doriferus ) around Tasmania included
material from regional ﬁsheries (Pemberton et al., 1992).
Our data suggest that by 2001–2002 government and
industry initiatives had not reduced the incidence ofthese interactions.
An important consideration regarding entanglement
rates is that entangled seals are less likely to be observedon land than other seals, for three reasons (Fowler,1987). First, observations of northern fur seals suggestan unknown number become entangled in material large
enough to prevent them returning to shore, so they die
at sea (Fowler et al., 1990). In the Bering Sea, 10–17% oftrawl net fragments contained at least one entangled seal(Fowler, 1987). Second, while non-entangled seals maybe counted many times throughout their lives, entangledseals will be counted less often as a result of their lowersurvival rates (Fowler et al., 1990). This is supported byour ﬁnding that only two of the entangled seals that
avoided capture were seen again and because few fur
seals are thought to dislodge entanglements (Fowler,1987; Fowler et al., 1990). This suggests there is a rela-tively fast turnover of short-lived entangled seals thatare replaced by recently entangled seals within a fur seal
population. Finally, entangled seals spend longer peri-ods at sea foraging than other seals, as a consequence ofthe additional drag (Fowler et al., 1990; Bengtson et al.,
1989). Although the relative amount of time entangled
seals spend on land between foraging trips has not beendetermined, it is unlikely that they spend longer on landthan non-entangled seals, reducing the probability ofobserving entangled seals (Bengtson et al., 1989; Fowleret al., 1990). The eﬀect of the above factors on youngnorthern fur seals was estimated because they suﬀersigniﬁcant mortality from entanglement. Fowler et al.
(1990) suggested the entanglement-related mortality for
young northern fur seals may be as high as 14% peryear––35 times the observed entanglement rate of juve-nile male seals. Entanglement rates and the subsequentmortality estimated in this study may be similarlyunderestimated.
Although we have shown an increase in seal entan-
glement in recent years, our comparisons may not reﬂect
the eﬀorts of ﬁshers to reduce these interactions. For
example, some of the packing tape, pieces of rope andother rubbish may have originated from ﬁshers or cargoships operating outside Australian waters. Similarly,plastic can persist in the environment for many years, sothe entangling material we observed may have been lostby ﬁshers several years prior. As a result, we may haveunderestimated the positive eﬀect of government and
industry attempts to reduce the impact of ﬁshing on the
marine environment. Continued monitoring of entan-glement rates may resolve these issues.
We compare population entanglement rates from
this study to those from other studies with anunderstanding that two diﬀerent methods have beenused to estimate rates: (1) the proportion of entangledseals at a colony from a series of surveys (e.g. Pem-
berton et al., 1992), and (2) the minimum annual
incidence of entanglement for a population of knownsize (e.g. this study). If the minimum annual incidenceof entanglement is not extrapolated to include monthsof the year when seal colonies are not monitored, thetwo methods would produce diﬀerent results. Howeveradequate sampling and estimating numbers of entan-gled seals ashore when colonies are not monitored
(e.g. Henderson, 2001 and this study) minimises such
errors.
The nature and amount of entangling material on fur
seals in the Southern Ocean and around Australia hasbeen shown to reﬂect the type and scale of regionalﬁsheries (Arnould and Croxall, 1995; Pemberton et al.,1992). At South Georgia the most common fur sealentanglement was packing tape (suspected to be from
longline vessels) and trawl net fragments used for mid-
water trawls (Arnould and Croxall, 1995). Interestingly,when ﬁshing activity diminished around South Georgiaentanglement rates also decreased. At Marion Island in38 B. Page et al. / Marine Pollution Bulletin 49 (2004) 33–42the Southern Ocean, the incidence of entanglement of
pinnipeds nearly doubled after 1996, in association withthe arrival of long-line ﬁsheries (Hofmeyr et al., 2002).Finally, a four year study of entangled Australian fur
seals around Tasmania coincided with the peak of the
orange roughy ( Hoplostethus atlanticus ) ﬁshery, when
many net fragments were lost (Pemberton et al., 1992).As the authors expected, trawl netting was the mostcommon fur seal entanglement (33%) followed bypacking tape (23%) derived from the rock lobster ﬁsheryand tuna longline vessels (Pemberton et al., 1992).
We examined whether recent trends of increasing sea
lion entanglement in monoﬁlament netting and New
Zealand fur seal entanglement in rock lobster ﬁsherymaterial and trawl netting, were matched by trends ofincreased ﬁshing eﬀort around Kangaroo Island (Fig. 3).Such a relationship did not exist between the southernshark ﬁshery and the number of sea lion entanglements.Annual gillnetting eﬀort almost halved during the study(from /C2480,000 km of gillnet per annum at the beginning
of the study to /C2445,000 km in 2000 and 2001)
(McLoughlin and Walker, 2002, Bureau of Rural Ser-vices unpublished data), while the number of entangle-ments increased (Fig. 3, Table 1). In the SouthAustralian rock lobster ﬁshery (around Kangaroo Is-land), eﬀort (pot lifts) also decreased during this study(Fig. 3) (South Australian Research and DevelopmentInstitute unpublished data). Increased sea lion/fur seal
entanglement during periods of decreased gillnetting/pot
lift eﬀort suggests these interactions require further re-search. Trawl ﬁshery data indicates that eﬀort (mea-sured in trawl hours) increased in both the entire southeast ﬁshery and the entire Great Australian Bight trawlﬁshery during the study (Fig. 3) (Tilzey, 2002; Tilzey andWise, 2002). These ﬁsheries span SW Australia tosouthern NSW, covering the regions where seals from
Kangaroo Island forage. From 1989 to 1991 eﬀort in the
south east ﬁshery and the Great Australian Bight trawlﬁshery was relatively constant (Fig. 3) at /C2465,000 trawlhours and /C247000 trawl hours, respectively. Between
2000 and 2002 the eﬀort in these ﬁsheries averaged/C24108,000 trawl hours and /C2411,500 trawl hours,
respectively (Tilzey, 2002; Tilzey and Wise, 2002, Bureau
of Rural Services unpublished data). In light of an
approximate doubling in trawl eﬀort (Fig. 3) aroundKangaroo Island during the study, more entanglementsin trawl netting from 2000 to 2002 are not unexpected.
4.1. Australian sea lions
The entanglement rate observed at Seal Bay (1.3%) in
2002 is the third highest recorded for any seal species.
Nearly all published seal entanglement rates are lessthan 0.5% (Fowler, 1987; Stewart and Yochem, 1987;Arnould and Croxall, 1995; Hofmeyr et al., 2002), withthe exception of Australian fur seals (1.3–1.9%) andCalifornia sea lions ( Zalophus californianus ) in the Sea
of Cortez, Mexico (3.9–7.9%) (Pemberton et al., 1992;Harcourt et al., 1994). Entanglements are thought to be
partially responsible for northern fur seal population
declines, where the entanglement rate is just 0.4%(Fowler, 1987). As the entanglement rate at Seal Bay isthree times that of northern fur seals, it is possible thatentanglements may be signiﬁcantly aﬀecting populationrecovery. Based on the Australian sea lion population of11,231 (Goldsworthy et al., 2003) and the 2002 entan-glement rate (1.3%), we expect 146 Australian sea lions
become entangled each year and at least 64 die as a
result (0.6% of the population, based on the minimummortality rate: 44%).
One of the goals of the southern shark ﬁshery By-
catch Action Plan is to identify whether ﬁshing practicesare having signiﬁcant and detrimental interactions onAustralian sea lions (AFMA, 2001b). Monoﬁlamentgillnetting is responsible for more sea lion entanglements
(55%) than all other items combined, so its signiﬁcance
can not be understated. Australian fur seals in Tasmaniaalso interact with gillnet ﬁsheries (thought to be both

Page et al. / Marine Pollution Bulletin 49 (2004) 33–42 39recreational and commercial), accounting for 11.5% of
entanglements (Pemberton et al., 1992). It is unlikelymonoﬁlament netting could fall oﬀ seals naturally be-cause its mesh is designed to stretch and catch on ﬁsh as
they struggle. As a result most sea lions entangled in
monoﬁlament netting would die. Under the BycatchAction Plan requirements, research should be conductedto explicitly determine the nature and extent of inter-actions between sea lions and the southern shark ﬁshery.This research should include satellite tracking and die-tary studies of sea lions to determine the extent of spatialoverlap in sea lion foraging eﬀort with commercial
ﬁsheries and which gender and age classes of seals are
more likely to interact with ﬁshing activities. It shouldalso include population modelling to determine thedemographic impacts of entanglement-related mortalityand the implications for Australian sea lion populationsand their conservation status.
The eﬀect of entanglements at the population level
can only be assessed once basic demographic parameters
are determined. Despite the current lack of demographic
knowledge, the life history of Australian sea lions sug-gests the species is vulnerable to low levels of entangle-ment-related mortality. Female Australian sea lionsbreed every 18 months and as a result they have fewerreproductive opportunities relative to other seal species.To sustain sea lion populations, relatively large energyinvestments in pups must be compensated by high sur-
vival rates, not just among pups but also for juveniles
and breeding females (Goldsworthy et al., 2003). Theincreasing number of entangled pups and juveniles ob-served since 2001 (Fig. 1) could be compounding thespecies’ slow recovery from 19th century sealing. Fur-thermore, entanglement-related mortality at other sealion colonies may be higher than at Seal Bay becauseseals at other sites are not released from entanglements
and debris is not collected.
It is worth speculating why a large proportion of sea
lions become entangled in monoﬁlament nets when NewZealand fur seals from nearby colonies do not. Adultmale and juvenile New Zealand fur seals would rarelyencounter monoﬁlament nets/debris because they foragein deeper waters than those used by the southern sharkﬁshery (Page unpublished data, McLoughlin and
Walker, 2002). Likewise, adult male Australian sea lions
are thought to feed oﬀ the shelf (Costa personal com-munication) and would not ﬁt their heads through the15–16 cm diameter mesh of monoﬁlament netting.Australian sea lion adult females, juveniles and pups andNew Zealand fur seal adult females are thought to for-age in regions where the southern shark ﬁshery oper-ates––on the shelf, south of Kangaroo Island (Costa and
Gales, 2003, Page unpublished data). However, infor-
mation on diving behaviour suggests Australian sealions would encounter monoﬁlament shark nets/debrismore frequently than New Zealand fur seal femalesfeeding in the same region. Australian sea lions are
benthic foragers that search out cryptic prey such asrock lobster, octopus and benthic ﬁsh (Gales and Cheal,1992; Costa and Gales, 2003), whereas New Zealand fur
seal females mainly feed on schooling ﬁsh and squid in
mid water (Page unpublished data). As monoﬁlamentshark nets are set close the seaﬂoor, New Zealand furseal foraging behaviour reduces the chance of thembeing caught in this material. However, Australian sealions may frequently come across monoﬁlament sharknets and may be attracted to them by struggling sharks.Young sea lions would be expected to be particularly
prone to entanglement in monoﬁlament netting as their
inquisitive nature may attract them to netting, as is thecase for northern fur seals (Fowler, 1987). Satellitetracking pups and juveniles may identify practical dis-tances for shark ﬁshers to operate around sea lion col-onies and hence reduce the number of entanglementsand also beneﬁt commercial ﬁshers.
The unique opportunity to walk amongst breeding
Australian sea lions at Seal Bay is the cornerstone of
Kangaroo Island’s $72 million annual tourism industry(TOMM, 2002). During 2001, 138,000 tourists visitedKangaroo Island, 110,000 of who were guided throughthe sea lion colony (TOMM, 2002 and NPWSAunpublished data). As there are approximately 700 sealions in the Seal Bay population (Shaughnessy unpub-lished data), each individual could be valued as an asset
that attracts over $100,000 in tourist revenue annually
($72M––700 seals). If sea lions became extinct from theisland the tourist industry would be considerably smal-ler. Research focussed on population trends of thesevaluable assets and threats to them is essential to protectthe island’s tourist industry.
4.2. New Zealand fur seals
The entanglement rate of New Zealand fur seals at
Cape Gantheaume in 2002 (0.9%) is only exceeded bythose of Australian sea lions (1.3%, this study), Aus-
tralian fur seals (1.3–1.9%, Pemberton et al., 1992) and
California sea lions in Mexico (3.9–7.9%, Harcourtet al., 1994). Based on the New Zealand fur sealentanglement rate in 2002 for the Australian populationof 57,443 (Goldsworthy et al., 2003), we estimate 517New Zealand fur seals become entangled each year andat least 295 of these die as a result (based on the mini-mum mortality rate: 57%). New Zealand fur seal pop-
ulations are currently increasing (Shaughnessy and
McKeown, 2002), suggesting that the current level ofentanglement-related mortality is unlikely to be greatlyaﬀecting the species’ recovery. However, given that NewZealand fur seals are protected species under Com-monwealth, State and Territory Acts, reduction inentanglement rates should be pursued.
40 B. Page et al. / Marine Pollution Bulletin 49 (2004) 33–42To reduce the impact of ﬁshing on New Zealand fur
seals, Commonwealth and State Governments shouldprovide incentives to companies that use biodegradablepacking tape or phase it out altogether. In the 1990s the
Tasmanian rock lobster industry tried to reduce the use
of packing tape. Cheaper, plastic-free bait boxes weredeveloped to eliminate packing tape from this ﬁshery.However these bait boxes were not mandatory and weretaken up by few bait-packing companies (Jones, 1994).In South Australia some bait boxes used by commercialﬁshers are bundled in biodegradable packing tape,however its use is not mandatory. Seals that become
entangled in biodegradable packing tape have a better
chance of the material breaking before it cuts throughtheir skin.
The rock lobster industry is a major source of marine
debris in southern and Western Australia (Dalgetty andHone, 1993; Edwards et al., 1992). Sixteen New Zealandfur seals were entangled in rock lobster ﬁshery material,in addition to some packing tape entanglements that
may have originated from the ﬁshery. Because the code
of best practice developed in 2000 by the rock lobsterindustry in South Australia recommended removingpacking tape from bait boxes and leaving it in port be-fore departure (Braund, 2000), it is surprising to see thismaterial is still prevalent on fur seals and sea lions. Therope found on seals suggests ﬁshers occasionally losepots and/or ﬂoats, as the rope attaches ﬂoats to haul-in
lines. New Zealand fur seals are also aﬀected by trawl
netting from the Great Australian Bight ﬁshery and/orthe south east trawl ﬁshery, which is responsible forabout 28% of entanglements.
The three seal species that breed in Australia have
some of the highest entanglement rates reported for anyseal species (Pemberton et al., 1992, this study). Basedon the most recently reported entanglement rates and
conservative estimates of subsequent mortality,
approximately 1478 entangled fur seals and sea lions diein southern Australia each year [ /C2464 Australian sea
lions and /C24295 New Zealand fur seals (this study) and
/C241119 Australian fur seals (87% injured when sighted,
Pemberton et al., 1992; Goldsworthy et al., 2003)].Entanglement-related mortality is most likely slowingthe recovery of Australian seal populations, particularly
Australian sea lions. The nature and amount of entan-
gling material in the marine environment highlights theneed for further education campaigns to demonstratethe eﬀect of plastic on marine animals. Governmentsshould provide incentives to the ﬁshing industry toimplement simple remedies that could decrease sealentanglement rates, particularly with regard packingtape. To further assess whether government policies,
industry initiatives and education campaigns reduce the
impact of ﬁsheries on the marine environment it isessential that monitoring of seal colonies and key ﬁsh-eries is continued.Acknowledgements
