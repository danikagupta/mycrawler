    Abstract - This study employed a comprehensive approach to 
testing the capability of P. ostreatus in decolourizing four 
different food dyes and to investigate the bio -adsorption 
properties of P. ostreatus under the equilibrium state. 
Decolourization of Carmoisine Red, Tartrazine Yellow, Brilliant 
Blue FCF and Fast Green FCF were determined by UV -visible 
spectrophotomet ric method. Present study had confirmed that P. 
ostreatus provided almost complete de colour ization of 10ppm 
food dyes. Dried P. ostreatus along with agitation have a higher 
efficiency, efficacy and capability during the dye 
decolour ization. As high as 81.3 4% for Carmoisine, 45.36% for 
Tartrazine, 19.82% for Brilliant Blue FCF and up to 28.99% for 
Fast Green FCF are removed by 5g/L of dried P. ostreatus in 
150rpm agitation speed. The interpretation of results had shown 
the maximum capacity (Qm) of P. ostreat us which range from 
0.05 to 0.43mg/L in dyes de colour ization.  Our data were 
adequately fitted to Langmuir isotherm and subordinate to 
Pseudo second kinetic order. Colour less solution of Carmoisine 
Red was visually transformed by P. ostreatus within 5 days  of 
dye treatment.

I. INTRODUCTION  
yes have been increasingly applied in the industries of 
cosmetics, textile, manufacturing, and food. With the high 
stability to lig ht, temperature and resistance to microbial attacks, 
a range of cost -effective and colour ful synthetics food dyes can 
be manufactured in pilot scale to sustain the limited choice of 
natural food dyes (Kiseleva et al. 2002).   
The synthetics food dyes are m ake up of complex aromatic 
molecular structures of azo and phenylmethane groups, which 
are recalcitrant xenobiotic compounds, that resistance to 
environmental de colour ization process (F u and Viraraghavan 
2001). Thus, leaving the unsolved environmental prob lem to 
biologists and public.  
    Chemical and physical wastewater treatments have been 
widely practices for the past decades compare to biological 
approach. Most of the physical approach, however, simply 
accumulate and concentrate wastewater, left over ca rcinogenic 
solid waste (food dyes), that further impede disposal problem. 
Expensive chemical approach using peroxide or ozone is 
inapplicable to schedule food industrial wastewater treatment.  
    To fill in the gap, biological approach using fungi to treat  
wastewater has received much attention recently. The white rot 
fungi have proven its capability to degrade synthetic chemicals, 
such as azo dyes from textile industry (Zhao and Hardin, 2007). 
The plausibility was this fungi secrets ligninolytic enzyme to 
degrade complex molecular structure of the synthetic dyes; thus, it was an alternative to the existing approach (Selvam et al., 
2003).  
    To date, vast majority of fungal strains have involved in 
biological decolourization approach. There were Aspergillus  
spp., Fusarium , Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Trametes 
vesicolour , Coriolus versi colour , Cunninghamella polymorpha, 
Funalia trogii  and Rhizopus arrhizus, Rhyzopus oryzae , Cyathus 
bulleri , Laetiporous sulphureus , Streptomyces sp., Trametes 
versi colour , Polyporus elegans, Trametes versicolor, Lenzites 
betulina, Mucor mucedo, Phanerochaete sordida, Pycnoporus 
sanguineus, and Trametes elegans  (Da-Re and Papinutti,  2011; 
Erum and Ahmed, 2010; Moturi and Singara -Charya, 2009;  
Seyis and Subasioglu, 2008; Erkut et al., 2007; Nigam et al., 
2000 )  
    Pleurotus ostreatus (P. ostreatus ), is widel y available, an 
edible mushroom for food industry. However, not much attention 
has been raised for its de colour ization ability.  This research is to 
source out the capability, efficacy and efficiency of  P. ostreatus  
in de colour izing the food dyes, indirectl y contributing knowledge 
to wastewater treatment in food industries.  
II. MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY  
A. Microorganism and Dye Preparation  
Fresh P. ostreatus bodies were purchased from TESCO Shah 
Alam, Malaysia. The unlived P. ostreatus biomass  was dried in 
the incubator (30oC, overnight) after removed its stipe. Potato 
Dextrose Agar (PDA) and Potato Dextroe Broth (PDB) (Fluka, 
Sigma -Aldrich USA) were prepared followed by autoclaving 
(121oC, 20mins) . 
P. ostreatus  was cultures on PDA. Active mycelium was cut 
and w as transferred to Universal bottles containing 10ml of PDB 
and incubated at 28oC. Prior to sterilization by autoclaving, the 
medium was adjusted to pH 6.5 with 20mM acetate buffer. After 
3-5 days, the inoculum of each bottles were homogenized.  
Four differe nt colour  dyes (N ona, Malaysia) were selected and 
each of their unique properties was further described in Table I.  
B. Decolourization Assay  
Dye decolourization assay was started on Petri dishes (3 
parallel) with different parameter of dyes after inoculate d with 
mycelial plugs cut from actively growing mycelia . Another 3 
parallel of P. ostreatus  that cultivated in the liquid medium  was 
decolourized with the respective dyes. Inoculated universal 
bottles with the same medium without dye served as control.

C. Adsorption Isotherm  and Kinetics Studies  
Adsorption studies were carried out  by dissolving 10ppm (part 
per million)  of dye . The 5, 10, 50g/L  of P. ostreatus gills (fresh 
and dried) were xthoroughly wit h different concentration of dyes 
and the suspensions were shaken (150rpm) at room temperature.  
D. Spectrophotometric Analysis  
    Samples of 1.0 mL were collected from the duplicate flasks 
and were centrifuged for 10,000rp for 5 min. The residual dyes 
concentration in the solutions were measured by Hitachi UV -vis 
U1900 spectrophotometer at required time intervals 1, 6, 24, 48, 
72, 96 and 120 hours . De colour ization was determined by 
monitoring the absorbance at the wavelength maximum for each 
dye as shown in Table 1.  
III. RESULTS  
A. Fungal Morphology and De colour ization Ability  
For the spore de colour ization studies, the de colour ization rate 
of respective strains was not as efficient as compared to the bio -
absorption studies. Fresh and dried gills of P. ostreatus  showed 
its excellence capability in both de colour ization and adsorption. 
However, cultured media condition may be the pitfall for the 
effectiveness of the cultured P. ostreatus  dye adsorption activity 
(Seyis and Subasioglu, 2008).  Dye degradation is improv ed by 
the active enzymes encoded in P. ostreatus biomass 
(Neela megam et al., 2004). Therefore, we will emphasis  on the 
biomass usage that is more advantageous in de colour ization 
studies.  
    Decolour ozation assay was chosen on 4  commercially 
important dyes , with a wide range of applications  across the 
household and food industries. De colour ization in dyes solution 
was assessed by visual disappearance of colour  and reduced in 
absorbance reading after 5 days. Carmoisine, Tartazine Yellow, 
Brilliant Blue FCF a nd Fast Green FCF  were de colour ized by 
0.1g of fresh P. ostreatus  with a percentage of 30.49 ±1.3, 
12.66 ±1.2, 5.11 ±0.2 and 10.43 ±0.3% respectively (Figure 1). 
Meanwhile,  dried P. ostreatus was significantly de colour ized the 
Carmoisine (77.83% ±0.9) and red colour  was visually 
disappeared on the fifth days.  Tarzine showed 36.45 ±1.1 % of 
dye de colour ization its appearance was transformed to light yellow.  Decolour ization of Brilliant Blue FCF ( 16.21 ±0.3%) and 
Fast Green FCF  (21.85 ±0.5%) were also achieved by 5g/ L of 
dried P. ostreatus.  Figure 1 illustrated the greater de colour ization 
efficacy for dried biomass than those of fresh biomass in our 
study.  
    Percentage for dye de colour ization was calculated according 
to the formula:  
   D(%) = ((C −S)/C)×100%;   where  
C -- absorbance of dye in a control sample,  
S -- absorbance of dye in samples

Tartazine Yellow, B= Brilliant Blue FCF, G= Fast Green FCF) at 
10ppm decolour ized by 5g/L dried and fresh P. ostreatus 
biomass after 120 hours treatment  
B. Effect of Agitation  
    Shaking at 150rpm, all dyes de colour ization was enhanced 
gradually with the passage of time. After 5 days of treatment, 
5g/L of fresh P. ostreatus  bioma ss has de colour ized 5.72%, 
3.8%, 2.1% and 1.59% with respect to Carmoisine, Tartazine 
Yellow, Brilliant Blue FCF and Fast Green FCF .  Agitation has 
an effect on the dried P. ostreatuss  decolour ization efficiency, 
the percentage of dye adsorption increased to the maximum of 
3.51% ( Carmoisine), 8.91% (Tartazine), 3.07% (Brilliant Blue 
FCF) and 7.15% (Fast Green FCF).  
   C. Langmuir Equilibrium and Absorption Isothern  
The capability of P. ostreatus  in colour  dyes absorption was 
demonstrated in Table II. The am ount of adsorption at 
equilibrium, qe (mg/g), was calculated using following formula 
(Santhi et al., 2010;  Hameed et al., 2008; Islek et al., 2008 ): 
;   where  
qe (mg/g) -- amount of dye adsorbed by P. ostreatus    biomass at 
equilib rium state,  
C0 and Ce (mg/L) -- the initial and equilibrium liquid phase 
concentration of dye  
V (L) -- total volume of dye solution,  
W (g) -- weight of the biomass

    Adsorption Isotherms is to investigate the association between 
the adsorbate concentra tion and the amount adsorbed on the 
absorbent at the constant rate . Langmuir Isotherm equation value 
was given in Table III. The equation may be expressed as 
(Vijayakumar  et al., 2012; Santhi and Manonmani, 2009):

Qm(mg/g). -- maxim um adsorption capacity, slopes  
k -- Langmuir constant  
From the graph of Ce/qe vs Ce, we can calculated where Q m 
equal to slope (1/Qm) and value of k is intercepts (1/kQm) of 
linear plots

D. Lagergren’s  Pseudo -First Order Kinetics Analysis  
Kinetic studies of adsorption were carried out in different 
contact time to the surface of P. ostreatus . The amount of dye 
absorbed were increase with the passage of time. Referring 
Vijayakumar  et al. (2012), the amoun t of adsorption qt (mg/g) 
was calculated by   
 
   Figure 2 and 3 represent the bio -adsorption model for Pseudo 
first and second kinetics order respectively. The high values of 
correlation coefficients in our data (Table IV) proved the kinetics 
of bioabsorp tion are obeying pseudo -first-order rate kinetic 
model.  
    The kinetic data were acquired from the Lagergren’s pseudo -
first order rate equation (Kumar et al, 2010; Santhi and 
Manonmani, 2009):  
   
 ;   where

IV. DISCUSSION  
    Dead P. ostreatus  with the amount of 20g/L showed an 
excellent dye de colour ization characteristic with an increasing 
surface area for adsorption as a consequence of cell rupture upon 
death. Increase dyes exposure on fungal cell wall that cove rs 
with chitin or chitosan is the major site of biosorption, for 
example the pileus (Vetter, 2007). Apart, researchers have also 
reported that dead biomass was better choices that can effectively 
adsorbing organic pollutants and dyes compare to live biomas s 
(Maurya et al., 2006;  Seyis and Subasioglu, 200 8). The International Journal of Scientific and Research Pu blications, Volume 2, Issue 4, April 2012                   4 
ISSN 2250 -3153  
 
www.ijsrp.org  disappearing of dyes (measure by visual appearance) was due to 
the chromophoric group transformation either by metabolism and 
adsorption of P. ostreatus. (Zhao, 2004)  P. ostreatus  biomass 
shown its highest capability and efficiency to adsorb and 
decolour ize Carmoisine which contains monoazo group. Phenols 
structure in Carmoisine  is ease to oxidize  to phenoxyl radicals by 
laccase in the presence of O 2 cofactor (Couto, 2009). Similarly, 
mono azo group o f Tartrazine, which owned a simple molecular 
structure and light molecular weights has successfully been 
decolour ized by P. ostre atus biomass. High laccase activity has 
reported in the de colour ization of Direct Dye Solar Golden 
Yellow R under optimized con dition (Jilani et al., 2011).  The 
Naphthyl compounds can be de colour ized to Naphthoquinone by  
P. ostreatus (Zhao, 2004). All the bonding and structure (azo, 
phenolic and naphthalene) can react by P. ostreatus  and produce 
uncolour ed compound after metabolis m thus it appeared 
translucent ( Yiping et al., 2008).  However, Brilliant Blue FCF 
with the high molecular weight and complex molecular structure 
are more resistant to be de colour ized by P. ostreatus.  Fast Green 
FCF also has similar instance with Brilliant Blue FCF, thus 
representing the Triphenylmethane dye group that contained 
complex molecular structure and large molecular weight is steric 
hindrance and resist food dyes to bind. The steric hindrance 
occurs due to the large molecular size and consequently caused it 
resistant to be transformed or degraded into simpler structure.  
Faraco et al. (2009) has reported in the presence of complex 
poly-azo and a stilbene structure in dye wastewater was  unable to 
be degraded by the laccases  of P. ostreatus . The chromo phoric 
group did not transformed by P. ostreatus , thus the colour  still 
can be visualized. All of these four dyes contain sulfonate groups 
can be de colour ized by P. ostreatus  (Lu et al., 2008).  
V. CONCLUSION  
As the result,  the low cost edible P. osteratus  can act 
effectively toward monoazo group of food dyes for Camoisine 
and Tartrazine in  aqueous solution. The isothermal data fitted to 
Langmuir equation and Q m was accounted as 0.45mg/g. The 
bioadsorption processes followed the pseudo - second order rate 
kinet ics. Thus, these results suggested that  chemisorption was the 
underlying mechanism  rather than physiosortion for dye in order 
to adsorp on the intersurface of P. ostreats.
