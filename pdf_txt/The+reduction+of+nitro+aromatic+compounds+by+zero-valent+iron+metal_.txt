The properties of iron metal that make it useful in 
remediation of chlorinated solvents may also lead to 
reduction of other groundwater contaminants such 
as nitro aromatic compounds (NACs). Nitrobenzene is 
reduced by iron under anaerobic conditions to aniline 
with nitrosobenzene as an intermediate product 
Coupling products such as azobenzene and azoxyben­
zene were not detected. First-order reduction rates 
are similar for nitrobenzene and nitrosobenzene, but 
aniline appearance occurs more slowly (typical 
pseudo-first-order rate constants 3.5 x 10-2, 3.4 x 
10-2, and 8.8 x 10-3 min-1, respectively, in the presence 
of 33 g/L acid-washed, 18-20 mesh Fluka iron turn­
ings). The nitro reduction rate increased linearly 
with concentration of iron surface area, giving a specific 
reaction rate constant (3.9 ± 0.2 x 10-2 min-I m-2 
L). The minimal effects of solution pH or ring substitution 
on nitro reduction rates, and the linear correlation 
between nitrobenzene reduction rate constants and the 
square-root of mixing rate (rpm), suggest that the 
observed reaction rates were controlled by mass transfer 
of the NAC to the metal surface. The decrease in 
reduction rate for nitrobenzene with increased con­
centration of dissolved carbonate and with extended 
exposure of the metal to a parti.cular carbonate buffer 
indicate that the precipitation of siderite on the metal 
inhibits nitro reduction. 
Introduction 
Over the last several years, a great deal of interest has developed in the groundwater remediation community over the prospects of new treatment strategies based on dechlorination by granular iron metal. The apparent success of the first field demonstration at Base Borden, Ontario (1). has led to the initiation of numerous feasibility studies. pilot tests, and small to medium scale demonstra­tion projects (2, 3). These developments have created a need for more process-level insight into the chemistry of these systems in order to explain, predict, and/or enhance their performance.

DD13-936xr.l6/D9JD-0153$12.DO/D <Q 1995 American Chemical Society - {6 The first detailed studies of halocarbon degradation by iron metal in laboratory batch systems ( 4, 5) made several fundamental considerations apparent: (i) halocarbon degradation occurs by dechlorination through a surface reaction with the metal as the ultimate electron donor; (ii) the major determinants of degradation kinetics are mass transfer to, area of, and condition of the metal surface; and 
(iii) mediation by H2, metal impurities, or microorganisms 
do not 
appear to be necessary for rapid degradation. Concurrent studies performed in laboratory columns (5, 6) showed that halocarbon degradation occurs similarly in porous media, but that there is an imponant additional consideration: geochemical evolution of the matrix material by iron dissolution and precipitation over the course of ·extended operation. Many additional studies of contami­nant remediation with zero-valent metals have now been reponed (2. 7-9). These studies suppon the view that contaminant degradation results from reduction coupled to metal corrosion, and most address at least one additional factor, such as the range of contaminants that may be remediated with reducing metals, the effect of groundwater geochemistry on :.-emediation performance, or the pos­sibilities for enhanced performance with derivative tech­nologies. 
The remediation of nitro aromatic compounds (NACs) is of interest because the nitro aromatic moiety is among the most characteristic of anthropogenic contaminants, 
being second in this regard only to organochlorine func­tional groups. NACs are common environmental con­taminants because of their use as munitions, insecticides, herbicides, pharmaceuticals, and industrial feed stock chemicals for dyes, plastics. etc. (10). They also may be formed in the environment from aromatic contaminants, 
as is the case with the nitro-PAHs and nitrophenols found in atmospheric waters (11, 12). Among the processes contributing to the environmental fate of NACs (13), reduction of the nitro group is cenainly the most charac­teristic. The transformation reaction generally produces the corresponding aromatic amines, with minor amounts of intermediates (hydroxylamines and nitroso compounds) 
and coupling products (azo and azoxy compounds). 
However, since aromatic amines are still of concern as environmental contaminants, remediation ofNACs requires transformation beyond nitro reduction. Two possible means for obtaining complete removal of NAC transfor­mation products are (i) biodegradation, which sometimes 
occurs more rapidly for aromatic amines than for the parent nitro compounds (14) and (ti) incorporation into natural organic matter by enzyme-catalyzed coupling reactions (1 5). In principle, either technique could be coupled to nitro reduction with FeD and the combination applied to treat environmental contamination by NACs. 
In this study, we investigated the reduction of nitroben­
zene by iron metal in bicarbonate-buffered batch systems to (i) assess the potential utility of nitro reduction by FeD in groundwater remediation, (til further our understanding 
of the reactivity of FeD with organic solutes in aqueous systems. and (ill) gain insight into the role that precipitation of solids such as FeC03 may play in remediation perfor­mance under geochemical conditions. The results indicate that nitro reduction by FeD is significantly faster than

study the l?ehavior of Fe0 in aqueous systems. For this purpose, the advantages ofNAC­reduction over dechlorination include the foUowing: (i)' volatilization of the organic reactant and its reduction products is much less significant, (ii) the specific rate of reaction is more rapid, and (iii) the reaction products do not include chloride, which itself is a strong promoter of corrosion. 
Background 
Oxidation of Fe0• Zero-valent iron metal, Fe0, is readily oxidized to feqous iron, fe2+, by many substances. In aqueous systems, this phenomenon leads to dissolution of the solid, which is the primary cause of metal corrosion. Metal corrosion is an electrochemical process in which oxidation of Fe0 to Fe2+ is the anodic half-reaction. The associated cathodic reaction may vary with the reactivity of available electron acceptors. In anoxic pure aqueous media, the acceptors include H+ and H20, the reduction of which yields OH-and Hz. Thus, the overall process of corrosion in anaerobic Fe0-Hz0 systems is classically described by the following reactions: 
Fe0 + 2H+-FeZ+ + Hz (1) 
Fe0 + 2Hz0 -Fe2+ + Hz + 20H- (2) 
The preferred cathodic half-reaction under aerobic condi­tions involves Oz as the electron acceptor. In this case, the primary reaction yields only OH-and not Hz: 
Other strong electron acceptors (oxidants), both inorganic and organic, may offer additional cathodic reactions that contribute to iron corrosion. Systems containing HC03-and HzCOJ species may act as electron acceptors to oxidize Fe0 and promote metal corrosion (16-18). Organic oxidants also react with Fe0, as illustrated by the dehalogenation of chlorinated hydrocarbons, R.Cl: 
Fe0 + RCI + H+-Fe2+ + RH + Cl- (4) 
Reaction 4 can contribute significantly to the net dissolution of iron. even in predominantly aqueous systems (19). NACs also exhibit facile reduction by Fe0, but this reaction is not a significant contributor to material damage by corrosion and therefore· has not been studied in detail from the corrosion perspective. 
Chemical Transformations of NACs. Under reducing conditions, NACs may react by a variety of pathways, which are summarized in Figure 1. Most of these reactions have been studied in great detail either as preparative methods in synthetic chemistry or as model reactions for electro­chemical investigations, and numerous reviews on these topics are available (20-23). In almost all cases, the major process is reduction of the nitro functional group to the corresponding amine (Figure 1, reactions I-IIO. Formally,

FIGURE 1. Schematic diagram showing the various possible transformation pathways far nitrobenzene in reducing environments. Downward arrows (reactions 1-111 and VI-VIII) indicate reduction reactions, and right-facing arrows (reactions IV-VI indicate condensations. The dominant reduction pathway of the nitro group to its amino equivalent may occur sequentially via nitrasa and hydroxylamine (reactions 1-111). 
this process consists of a series of two-electron additions, proceeding through nitroso and hydroxylamine intermedi­ates. However. the reduction potentials for reactions I and II are very slrnilar, so polarography performed on acid to neutral aqueous solutions gives only two waves: the first corresponding to a four-electron reduction for formation of the hydroxylamine, and the second corresponding to a two-electron reduction of the hydroxylamine to the amine. At alkaline pH. only one six-electron wave is observed. Accumulation of the nitroso compound is rarely found in practice, and special techniques are often necessary to obtain direct evidence for its formation (24. 25). Indirect evidence for its formation is abundant, however, becausr condensation reactions involving the nitro so intermediac. (reactions IV-V) give azoxy and azo compounds, which are frequently observed in significant yields from nitro reduction (26-28). Product distributions may be further complicated by reduction of the condensation products (reactions VI-VIIO (29) or rearrangements such as the formation of benzidine (not shown) (30). 
Reduction of NACs is well documented for aqueous media containing zero-valent metals such as Fe, Zn, or Sn because these reactions have been used widely in the synthesis of amines (31). According to a method that originated with an early study by Lyons and Smith (32). high yields can be obtained using Fe0 and trace amounts of salts containing Fe2 .. or ct-. In addition to the formation of amines, dissolving metal reductions of NACs may produce good yields of the other products represented in Figure 1. For example, reduction of nitrobenzene with Zn is reported to be useful for preparation of phenylhydrozyl­amine (33). In general, however, yields of products other than arnines are usually small and variable. so the reaction is of limited synthetic utility and has received litde atten­tion in the recent literature. 
In environmental media, reduction of NACs occurs by both biotic and abiotic means (34). The dominant reaction pathway under anaerobic environmental conditions ap­pears to be nitro reduction to the amine. However, there is evidence for most of the other pathways in Figure l, including coupling of nitro reduction intermediates to form azo and azoxy compounds, and reductive cleavage of azo compounds to form amiries (35). The former reaction is of particular importance because azo and azoxycompounds ····-···-· .,._ ................... ,~ ... .J ,., ........ , th~ir precursors.

Experimental Section 
Chemicals. Nitro aromatic compounds and their likely reaction products were obtained in high purity from Aldrich and Chern Service and used as received. These included nitrobenzene, 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene, 1,3-dinitroben­zene, 4-nitrotoluene, 4-nitroanisole, 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene, parathion, nitrosobenzene, aniline, azobenzene, and azoxy­benzene. Roughly 1 mM stock solutions were prepared in deionized water (18 MQ·cm Nanopure) with up to 5% (vlv) HPLC-grade methanol The bicarbonate buffer media were prepared by flowing deoxygenated 1% C02 in N2 or 100% C02 (i.e., pC02 = 0.01 and 1.0 atm. respectively) for roughly 2 h through a 15 mM NaOH solution in deionized water. Analytical grade C02 and other gases were deoxygenated prior to use by passing through a heated column of reduced copper. The pH range available from the above method was between 5.5 and 8.0, as determined by pC02 and the aqueous alkalinity. To prepare more acidic buffers. lhe initial NaOH solution· was modified by the addition of HCl prior to sparging with C02. 
The iron metal used in this study (Fluka electrolytic iron, catalog no. 44905) was selected to give manageable nitro reduction rates in the experimental system described below. Compared with the Fe0 used in our previous studies (4. 6), this material has a coarser grain size (mostly >40 mesh) and clean, smooth surfaces with a high metallic luster. The nominal purity is 99.9% wilh the remainder consisting primarily of iron oxide. Trace impurities are less than 0.02% C. 0.008% S, 0.003% Si, 0.002% P, 0.002% Mn, and 5 ppm of Mg. The surface area of a 18-20 mesh sieved iron sample prior to acid treatment was determined to be 0.005 m2/g by gas adsorption using BET analysis. 
Iron Pretreatment. Prior to use, the Fe0 grains were hand-sieved to constrain grain size to 18-20 mesh and sonicated in 10% HCl (v/v) for 20 min to remove surface oxides or other contaminants.· The cleaned metal was washed four times with the bicarbonate buffer to remove residual acidity or chloride remaining after the acid treatment. The entire acid-washing procedure was per­formed under a stream of deoxygenated N2 with freshly deoxygenated bicarbonate buffer to avoid further surface oxidation to metal oxides. A series of control tests indicated that the mass of Fe0 lost due to this pretreatment was 4.9 ± 0.2%. The BET surface area of the iron sample following the acid-treatment increased to 0.038 m2/g. 
Model Reaction Systems. Individual degradation ex­ periments were performed in anaerobiC (sealed) batch systl!ms prepared in 60-mL serum bottles, In most cases, bottles received 2 g ofdry, sieved iron. Following the acid wash, the bottles were filled with fresh bicarbonate buffer medium and crimp-sealed using thick butyl rubber sep-ta (Pierce). Before initiating degradation experiments, each uulll~ was .1.uowed :! h to ~quilibrate on an ~nJ-over-enJ. rotary shaker at" 10 rpm in a dark. 15 'C room. Early experiments in unbuffered Fe-H~o systems resulted in the expected pH rise (>2 units in -4 hl due to aqueous corrosion of lhe metal (eqs 2 and 31. Although previous batch studies of dechlorination by F~·1 have not shown evidence that the pH rise due to aqueous corrosion significantly effects contaminant degradation rates ( .J). we favored buffered systems for this study to gain greater control over experimental conditions. Pre..,ious srudies have used various biological buffers in batch systems containing Fe0 and not found any specific buffer effects (.J. 7, 8). A bicarbonate buffer with total dissolved carbonate = 1.5 x 10-2 M was adopted for routine experiments because it provided a reasonable buffer capacity without visible precipitation of iron carbonates during the course of a typical degradation experiment {4-5 h}. A typical reduction experiment began by the addition of 1 mL of 10-3M deoxygenated aqueous stock solution of nitrobenzene (or nitrosobenzene, or one of the substituted nitrobenzenes) by needle injection through the septum. Standard incubation conditions were maintained through­out each experiment (i.e., dark, 15 oc, 10 rpm). Loss of parent organic compound and formation of reduction produces were determined by periodically removing 200-~L samples for immediate analysis by HPLC. The BET surface area of the iron sample obtained from serum bottles after the reduction experiment was 0.021 m~/g. 
Analyse~. The concentrations of unreacted substrate and its various reaction products were determined by isocratic HPLC with UV absorbance detection. The ana­ lytical column (4 mm x 10 em) consisted of Microsorb packing (particle size, 3 ~m) wi.th a C-18 stationary phase. A precolumn (4.6 mm x 1.5 em) of the same material was also used. The eluent consisted of 60/40 acetonitrile and water (in most cases. buffered with Trizma at pH = 7) with a flow rate of0.9 mL/min. The absorbance was monitored at 270 nm, which is close to the .lmax for nitrobenzene (272 nm) and nitrosobenzene (280, 300 nm). Peaks were identified by comparison with the retention times of standard compounds, and concentrations were determined from peak areas by comparison to standard curves. Surface area was estimated by BET Kr-gas adsorption (Y..licromer­itics) on samples that were prepared by rapidly drying the metal with methanol and storing under N2 to avoid surface oxidation. 
Results and Discussion 
Pathway of Nitro Reduction by Fe0• The reaction of nitrobenzene by Fe0 under the conditions of this study produced aniline with nitrosobenzene as an intermediate product. Accounting for these three species gives good, mass balance at pH> 5.5 (>85%), but \vith a reproducible dip at intermediate times (Figure 2}, which suggests that all of the nitrosobenzene formed is not in solution and/or that there is an additional reaction intermediate. Phenyl­hydroxylamine is the most likely intermediate and may correspond to an unidentified peak with retention time = 1.2 min (cf. -1.0 min for the solvent peak, 2.2 min for aniline, 3. 7 min for nitrobenzene. and 4.2 min for nitrosobenzene). Similar elution patterns have been reported for nitroben­zene reduction in other systems (24. 38). The variation in size of this peak with reaction time suggests an intermediate in reduction from nitrosobenzene to aniline. and similar behavior was observed when nitrosobenzene was used as

the initial substrate. However, a standard for phenylhy­
droxylamine was not available, so this assignment was not confirmed. Neither azoxybenzene or azobenzene were 
obsetved as products of nitrobenzene reduction, indicating 
that condensation reactions (pathways IV-V, Figure 1) are 
insignificant at the substrate concentrations used in this 
study. The absence of detectable azo and azoxy interme­
diates suggests that reduction of these compounds (i.e .• 
pathways VI-VIII, Figure 1) was not a significant contributor 
to the formation of aniline. 
Based on these results, sequential nitro reduction to 
aniline via intermediate nitroso and hydroxylamine com· 
pounds appears to be the only imponant transformation 
process occurring in the Fe0-H20-C0 2 systems studied. 
Formally, the overall reaction 
occurs in three steps, each involving a two-electron 
reduction, with Fe0 as the ultimate electron donor. The 
contributing two-electron reactions can be written as

Kinetics of Transformation. Experiments were gener­
ally performed with nitrobenzene at an initial concentration 
of about 1.5 x 10-s M, and the reaction was monitored 
until >98% complete C-3 h). Loss of nitrobenzene was 
found to be <5% over 48 h in control experiments without 
Fe0, so all of the disappearance during the first few hours 
was attributed to nitro reduction. Natural log concentration 
versus time plots for nitrobenzene reduction were unam­

regression on these data was used for routine determination 
of k., the pseudo-first-order rate constant for eq 6. The 
average standard deviation for nitro reduction rate con­
stants determined for several series of replicate experiments 
was <2.5%. As .,.,as concluded previously for the dechlo· 
rination of CCI.t (4), the lack of deviation from ftrst-order 
kinetics indicates that changes in reactivity of the Fe0 due 
to corrosion and precipitation are not significant over 
several hours. However, nitro reduction experiments that 
were allowed to run to completion did exhibit a small decline 
in k1 at exposure times over 1 h. A similar decline in rates 
was observed by Gillham and O'Hannesin for the reduction 
of chlorinated aliphatics in batch experiments (5). 
First-order rate constants for the appearance of nitroso­
benzene were obtained by nonlinear regression. assuming 
a kinetic model for sequential first-order reactions is 
appropriate (4). For the data in Figure 2, the rate constant 
is 0.069 ± 0.010 min-1, which is roughly twice the value k1 = 0.035 ± 0.001 rnin-1 obtained by fitting the data for 
nitrobenzene disappearance. The discrepancy is modest, 
but appears to be significant, and suggests an additional 
reaction for nitrosobenzene formation. One such reaction 
might be the dismutation of phenylhydroxylamine (39), 
but no effon was made to test this hypothesis experimen­
tally. 
The kinetics of nitrosobenzene reduction Ceq 7) were 
also investigated in two ways. Using nitrosobenzene as 
the initial substrate, pseudo-first-order disappearance was 
observed, and therefore k2 could be obtained simply by 
linear regression of the natural log concentration versus 
time data Alternatively, the concentration of nitrosoben­
zene as an intermediate in nitrobenzene reduction could 
be fit by nonlinear regression to the kinetic model for 
sequential first-order reactions. For similar conditions, the 
value of k2 obtained from sequential nitrobenzene reduction 
(0.006 ± 0.001 min-•. Figure 2) was significantly less than 
that obtained from nitrosobenzene as the initial substrate 
(0.034 ± 0.001 min-1, Figure 3). This difference may be 
due to competition for reactive sites on the metal by 
nitrobenzene and its sequential reduction products. The 
reduction of phenylhydroxylarnine (eq 8) was accessible 
only in terms of aniline appearance. The kinetics of aniline 
appearance in Figure 2 fit a first-order model with a rate 
constant, k3, of0.009 ± 0.001 min-1• The relatively slow 
rate of aniline appearance is consistent with previous l TABt.E 1

reports that aniline inhibits corrosion of steel by adsorbing strongly and covering surface sites (40). Effect of Substrate Properties. The similarity in disap­pearance rates for nitrobenzene and nitrosobenzene (Figure 3) suggests a fundamental similarity in the rate controlling processes. However, the diffusion coefficients and reduc­tion potentials for these two compounds are very similar (Table 1). so this result alone cannot be used to determine whether the kinetics are limited by diffusion to/from reactive surface sites or by chemical reaction steps (activa­tion control). Therefore, additional experiments were performed with a series of para-substituted nitrobenzenes selected to exhibit a range of diffusive and electronic properties. The resulting values of k1 (Table 1) show little if any change in nitro reduction rates over a wide range of redox potentials as long as substrate diffusivities are similar. Parathion is the only compound that exhibits a significantly different value of k~o consistent with the lower diffusion coefficient- that results from the bulky p-(0,0-diethyl phosphorothioate) substituent on the nitrophenyl ring. Effects of the Iron Surface. Since the dechlorination of halocarbons by Fe0 involves reaction at the metal surface (4, 5), it was anticipated that the condition and quantity of metal surface area would also influence the kinetics of nitro reduction. Previous work has shown that treatment of the metal with dilute HCI prior to each experiment accelerates dechlorination rates and improves the reproducibility of reaction rate determinations (4). In this study, preliminary experiments showed similar effects for nitrobenzene re­duction. The greatest increase in k1 resulted from the combined action ofHCl and sonication, so a protocol based on this treatment was adopted for all subsequent experi­ments. Aside from the practical advantages of increasing the magnitude and reproducibility of the desired reaction rates. our investigations of pretreatment effects also provide insight into the role of the metal surface in contaminant transformation. The observed effect of acid pretreatment may be due to one or more of the following changes: (i) cleaning of the surface by dissolution of metal and breakdown of the passivating oxide layer; (ii) increasing the metal surface area by etching and pitting through corrosion or by mechanical abrasion during sonication; (iii) increase in the density of highly reactive "sites" consisting of steps. edges, and kinks. following corrosion by acid; and (iv) increased concentrations of adsorbed H­and cl-that persist after pretreatment with HCI. 0.04 -

FIGURE 4. Effect of Fe0 surface area concentration on the pseudo­first-order rate constant for nitrobenzene reduction. Experiments were perfonned by varying mass of 18-20 mesh, acid-washed Fluka iron turnings. All were perfonned in 1.5 x 10-1M bicarbonate buffer at 10 rpm and 15 °C, after 2 h for buffer equilibration. The regression line corresponds to eq 9. 
Under circumstances where the metal surface condition is effectively constant, the quantity of available surface area is among the most significant experimental variables affecting contaminant reduction rates. Figure 4 shows that rate constants for nitrobenzene reduction, k~o increase linearly with the mass ofFe0 per unit reaction volume (g/L) over the range of conditions studied. Assuming a constant specific surface area of 0.021 m2/g, the more general independent variable of surface area concentration. (surface areal, can be derived. Unear regression on the data for k1 (min- 1) and (surface area) (m2/L) gives

with i2 = 0.997 for n = 5, and the uncertainties represent one standard deviation. The resulting intercept is statisti­cally significant but negligible under realistic experimental conditions. indicating that other loss processes are minor. and essentially all disappearance is attributable to reaction with Fe0• The slope of eq 9 is the specific reaction rate constant; i.e .• where k1 has been normalized to l m2/L iron. Reduction rates characterized in these terms should be independent of the mass and specific surface area of the metal used and the volume of the reaction system. At present, however, there is no practical way to factor out variation in the density of reactive sites on the metal surface. , The latter correction will be particularly important if meaningful comparisons are to be made between iron samples from different sources or with different histories that affect the type and density of surface precipitates. For example, the 16-fold difference between the values 2.5 ± 0.2 x 10-3 min-1 m-2 L reported previously for CC4 reduction by Fisher Fe0 (4) and 3.9 ± 0.2 x IQ-2 min-1m-2 L determined for nitrobenzene in this study probably reflects. in part. differences in the properties of the two organic reactants. However, reacti_vity per unit surface area of iron is also likely to be a significant variable because the Fe0 source and pretreatment were not the same in the two studies.

Previous studie$ have shovm that decreased pH results in a modest increase in CC4 dechlorination rate under conditions that probably were borderline between activation and diffusion control ( 4) and in a strong increase in dechlorination rate where activation control may have been predominant (9). In this study, the results indicate no clear effect on k1 over the environmentally relevant pH range of 6-8 and only a small decrease for pH < 6 {41). The general lack of a pH effect, however. is consistent with nitro reduction rates that are limited by mass transport to reactive sites on a surface where pH -controlled precipitation reactions are comparatively slow (and ionic strength is roughly constant). 
A more dramatic effect of pH was observed on the distribution of nitro reduction products. Following the disappearance of nitrobenzene and the intermediate nitroso product, the fmal concentration of aniline provided nearly complete mass balance at pH > 5. Values of k3, estimated from the rate of aniline appearance, decreased slighdy from 0.015 min-1 at pH 5 to 0.009 min-1 at pH 6.9. However, below pH 5, no aniline production at all was detected. It is unlikely that the lack of aniline appearance at pH <. 5 indicates a real change in the product distribution since all of the major transformation pathways produce aniline {Figure 1). Instead, protonation of the aniline formed (pKa = 4.6) probably prevents desorption of the product due to electrostatic attractions that involve the anilinium cation and specifically adsorbing counterions such as Cl-(40). Effect of Mixing Rate. The usual method of mixing employed in this study was 360° rotation at 10 rpm around a fuced-length axis. Since the rate of rotation was rapid relative to the rate of reaction, rpm should be linearly related to the actual velocity of mixing experienced by the metal (at least until centrifugal forces become significant). Numerous empirical determinations have shown that this velocity is proportional to the square of the mass transfer coefficient for diffusion across a stagnant boundary layer (42). Therefore, nitro reduction rate constants should exhibit a linear relationship with respect to (rpm)0·s, under conditions where the reaction is mass transport limited. Values of k, measured in this study increased linearly with (rpm)0.s up co about 45 rpm {Figure 5), and regression on these data gives 
k1 = (0.015 ± 0.001) x (rpm)0·5-(0.015 ± 0.002) (10) 
where r2 = 0.998 for n = 6. The result provides further evidence for the conclusion that nitro reduction rates are mass transport limited under the conditions of this study. Effect of Bicarbonate: In most natural waters. ambient levels of pCOz and alkalinity determine the pH and

carbonate speciation. In the presence of Fe0, H2C03 and HCOJ-can be reduced and thereby accelerate corrosion (17, 18) or precipitate as siderite, which eventually will inhibit corrosion by limiting mass transfer to the metal surface. The net impact of these phenomena on the application of Fe0 to remediation of contaminated ground­ waters can be predicted from results obtained in this study using C02-buffered model systems. In early experimen~. it was observed that k1 was notably greater in the presence of moderate concentrations of carbonate buffer relative to unbuffered systems at comparable pH. This increase in k1 appears to be due to carbonate-enhanced corrosion in the absence of significant precipitation. In subsequent experi­ ments, it was discovered that k1 decreased at high total carbonate concentrations (from 0.035:!: 0.001 min-1 at 1.5 x 10-z M to 0.029:!: 0.001 at 6.0 x 10-z M (41)] and with extended exposure to a particular bicarbonate buffer (Figure 6). Thus, nitro reduction rates decline as circumstances that favor precipitation of iron carbonates improve. Pre­ cipitates such as siderite that are much less redox active than the underlying zero-valent metal generally will inhibit ArNO (ada) l ~.

contaminant reduction by creating a barrier for mass transport to active sites on the metal surface. Therefore, these conditions may prove to be important determinants 
of field performance in contaminant remediation. 
Mechanism of Nitro Reduction. Although mass trans­port of NACs to the iron surface is rate-limiting and determines the observed first-order rate of disappearance, 
competition between desorption and further reduction determines the degree to which intermediate transforma­tion products are observed in the solution. This relationship 
is illustrated in Figure 7 for reduction of nitrobenzene. 
Appearance of nitrosobenzene as an intermediate in this study implies that its desorption is rapid relative to further reduction to the hydroxylamine (i.e., the step corresponding 
to k-No is rapid in comparison to that corresponding to k25). It is important to note thatArNHOH<adsl must still be formed even though ArNHOH<aql was not identified, just as ArNO<adsl is believed to be an intermediate in electro­chemical nitro reduction even though ArNO<aql is rarely detected (24, 43). An analogous situation probably exists with dechlorination reactions caused by iron metal. In the latter case, sequential dechlorination is lilcely to be the dominant reduction pathway at the metal surface (4), even though the distribution of products in solution generally does not show the appropriate amounts of intermediate 
species. The major reason for this is that the distribution 
of products observed in the aqueous phase is determined _ by the races at which various species undergo desorption and transport away from the metal as well as the intrinsic rates of the reductive dechlorination at the surface. 
Aniline cannot be further reduced by iron and. in fact, is a well-known corrosion inhibitor. The mechanism of inhibition is believed to be simple interference with mass transport of oxidant to the metal surface, which in turn is strongly influenced by the orientation of aniline adsorption 
( 40). Corrosion inhibition by this mechanism implies that contaminant reduction rates may also be limited by competition for reactive sites on the metal. This would be consistent with the kinetics of nitrosobenzene reduction _observed in this study (Figures 2 and 3) and may have general significance to the application of Fe0 as a reducing agent in groundwater remediation. 
. 
A likely reduction mechanism for the adsorbed NAC involves the planar donor-acceptor complex as a precursor to electron transfer (23, 44). The adsorbed molecule must undergo a series of electron transfers. prot-on transfers. and dehydrations to achieve complete reduction, and the order . of these ·steps has been the subject of many detailed electrochemical studies. For example, nitro reduction may be initiated by electron transfer to form an anion radical 
(43, 45) or by protonation to ·form a cation which then accepts an electron ( 46). The precise sequence will vary as a function of pH. solvent prqperties, and composition of the surface where adsorption and reaction occur. Schwarz­enbach et aL (38, 47, 48) have concluded that electron transfer is initiating and rate limiting in several homoge­neous model systems based on correlations of nitro reduction rates to one-electron reduction potentials. In this study, reduction rates reflect mass transport .to the metal surface, so there is no correlation to the energetics 
of electron transfer. Mass transport also influences the kinetics of further degradation and, therefore, the distribu­tion of detectable reduction products. For this reason. the sequence of electron and proton transfer is unlikely to have a discernible effect on the reaction of NACs by Fe0 under environmental conditions where the metal surface develops a passivating diffusion boundary of iron oxides or carbon­ates.
