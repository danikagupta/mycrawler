Interactions, and Causality

Abstract: This review focuses on new data from recent pub-
lications concerning how compounding interactions between
different thermoregulatory pathways inﬂuence the develop-ment of hyperthermia and/or neuroleptic malignant syndrome(NMS), and the fundamental issue of the presumed causal
role of antipsychotic drugs. The formal criteria for substanti-
ating cause-effect relationships in medical science, estab-lished by Hill, are applied to NMS and, for comparison, also
to malignant hyperthermia and serotonin toxicity. The risk of
morbidities related to hyperthermia is reviewed from humanand experimental data: temperatures in excess of 39.5 8C
cause physiological and cellular dysfunction and high mortal-
ity. The most temperature-sensitive elements of neural cells
are mitochondrial and plasma membranes, in which irreversi-ble changes occur around 40 8C. Temperatures of up to 39 8C
are ‘‘normal’’ in mammals, so, the term hyperthermia should
be reserved for temperatures of 39.5 8C or greater. The im-plicitly accepted presumption that NMS is a hypermetabolic
and hyperthermic syndrome is questionable and does not
explain the extensive morbidity in the majority of cases,where the temperature is less than 39 8C. The thermoregula-
tory effects of dopamine and acetylcholine are outlined, espe-
cially because they are probably the main pathways by which
neuroleptic drugs might affect thermoregulation. It is notablethat even potent antagonism of these mechanisms rarely
causes temperature elevation and that multiple mechanisms,
including the acute phase response, stress-induced hyperther-mia, drugs effects, etc., involving compounding interactions,are required to precipitate hyperthermia. The application of
the Hill criteria clearly supports causality for drugs inducing
both MH and ST but do not support causality forNMS./C2112010 Movement Disorder Society

This article considers advances in the understanding
of thermoregulatory mechanisms that might be relevantto neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) and, espe-cially, of how compounding interactions between dif-ferent thermoregulatory control mechanisms play a rolein precipitating hyperthermia. Evidence is reviewed
suggesting the causal relationship with neuroleptics
and the hyperthermic nature of NMS are not assecurely founded as is usually assumed. These ideasare explored by applying the Hill criteria of causalityand criteria for ‘‘hyperthermia’’ are suggested. It is not

MEASUREMENT AND DEFINITION
OF HYPERTHERMIA
The term hyperthermia is often used imprecisely, and
the extent to which NMS involves fever and/or hyper-thermia is uncertain. This article will use the termhyperthermia, but a substantial and uncertain proportion
of cases exhibit features of an acute phase response
(APR), preceding symptoms. If hyperthermia is thoughtto be the main mechanism mediating morbidity in NMS(which is by no means certain), then the degree of tem-perature elevation required to produce morbidity is akey issue, and accurate measurement of relevant tem-peratures (muscle, core, brain, and skin) is vital. Fever(fever is synonymous with pyrexia) is different from
hyperthermia, because it is mediated by pyrogenic cyto-
kines triggering the APR. The APR involves a changein the thermal set point to a higher level (with engage-ment of physiological thermoregulation mechanisms)and a variety of other subsequent systemic responses,including somnolence, anorexia, changes in plasma pro-tein and hormone synthesis, gluconeogenesis, and eryth-ropoiesis (e.g., increased leucocyte count and altered
iron distribution). The ﬁnding of low serum iron
26is
now understood as a consequence of APR-causedchanges in serum iron,
27,28as recently highlighted by
Rosebush et al.29There is still no single reliable marker
for the APR,27,30so, it is relevant to note that signiﬁ-
cant underestimation of the frequency with which anAPR is associated with NMS may be occurring.
In hyperthermia, the thermoregulatory control mech-
anisms are impaired, disabled, or overwhelmed,
whereas in fever, they are intact.
31The term hyperther-
mia is generally used for any elevation of temperature,even within the established physiological range. Thenormal physiological range of brain temperature isillustrated by rat hypothalamus measurements: 36 8C
during sleep, 37.3 8C at rest, and peaking at /C24398C
during physiological arousal and stress-induced
states.
32–34Indeed, ‘‘normal’’ human body core temper-
ature spans the temperature range for other mammals,i.e., 36 8Ct o4 0 8C (Ref. 35, from Table 1, p.111). The
fact that stress and emotion-induced temperatureincrease are also applicable to humans is indicated byvarious observations,
36,37most recently, by the reliably
veriﬁed capabilities of a cold water swimmer, who isable to raise his core temperature to 38.4 8C in his pre-
swim mental preparation, without exercise, probably
by increased thermogenesis.
38In the NMS literature, hyperthermia is generally
used to indicate any temperature elevation above 37 8C,
which is not the same as current ideas about what con-
stitutes fever (a single measurement of 38.5 8Co r3 8 8C
for 1 hour39). Since temperatures of up to 39 8C are
normal, in certain contexts, and heat damage to tissuesoccurs at around and above 39.5 8Ct o4 0 8C, this seems
unhelpful. It is notable that temperature, as a key phys-ical variable and a criterion for NMS, has been unsci-entiﬁcally measured: the method and site of measure-
ment and the accuracy of the instruments employed
receives inadequate consideration: meticulous attentionto serial measurements of skin, muscle, and brain andcore temperatures would be expected to lead to advan-ces. Until 2008, there were no guidelines for methodand site of temperature measurement, and such as nowexist are not widely disseminated or practiced.
40,41
Recent reviews of noninvasive methods have found
that the widely used newer generation of infrared aural
thermometers (they do not measure tympanic mem-brane temperature) are inadequate for routine clinicaluse and not of a sufﬁcient standard for research, opera-tive, or critical care uses.
42,43Therefore, the issue of
possible morbidity from temperature changes in differ-ent tissues (e.g., muscle, brain, and core) is hard toassess as there is no accurate data.
Morbidity Related to Hyperthermia
Various data give an indication of the risk of mor-
bidities in hyperthermic states. A (rectal) temperatureof 40.6 8C is often used to deﬁne heat stroke, although
more recent reviews use 40 8C.
44In the Dematte
et al.45series, the acute mortality rate was 21%, and
33% had moderate to severe impairment on discharge.
A core temperature of 40 8C is associated with a dis-
turbed level of consciousness, brain edema, andTABLE 1. The Hill criteria of causality, applied to MH,

Movement Disorders, Vol. 00, No. 00, 2010increased mortality.44,46–48Experimental studies indi-
cate that even small elevations in temperature worsen
histopathological and behavioral outcome in central
nervous system (CNS) injuries.49,50In vitro experi-
ments show that the most temperature-sensitive ele-ments of neural cells are mitochondrial and plasma(cell) membranes, in which irreversible changes in pro-teins occur around and above 40 8C.
51–54These obser-
vations clearly indicate that a temperature of 39 8Ct o
408C is the logical point to deﬁne ‘‘clinical hyperther-
mia,’’ because, in both humans and other mammals,
temperatures of up to 39 8C occur during normal activ-
ities and above 40 8C is associated with cellular injury
and physiological and clinical impairment and substan-tial mortality. Furthermore, brain temperature may behigher than core temperature.
55,56A true core tempera-
ture of 40 8C, thus, demands immediate action, in
minutes rather than hours, and an urgency of transfer
to a (more) suitable medical facility comparable with
an acute cardiac case. Therefore, when the temperaturereaches 39 8C, it is appropriate to have an action and
treatment plan in place to prevent vulnerable cerebraltissues from being subjected to injurious hyperthermia.
Thermoregulatory Mechanisms and Control
Core temperature at rest varies by about 1 8Ca sa
result of the circadian rhythm, the inﬂuence of themenstrual cycle, and body heat distribution
57and
varies by about 3 8C with various normal activities,
from 36 to 39 8C.32Although recognition that all hyper-
thermic states are substantially inﬂuenced by ambientconditions should be a sine qua non in all considera-
tions of hyperthermia, it is sometimes forgotten, and
ambient conditions are rarely reported, except in heat
stroke studies. This makes it impossible to do evencrude post hoc reassessment of ambient conditions in
most published material on NMS.
The most important CNS control center for thermo-
regulation is the preoptic anterior hypothalamicarea,
41,58but thermoregulation is hierarchical at succes-
sive levels of the nervous system with substantial over-
lapping redundancy: some mechanisms operate at the
spinal, some at brainstem, and some at hypothalamiclevel (Gurrera et al.
19discuss the role of the sympa-
thetic nervous system and other detailed considerationsin depth). Recent evidence demonstrates two aspectson which this article focuses: ﬁrst, thermoregulatory re-dundancy, and second, potentiation by compoundinginteractions, e.g., of drug-induced antimuscarinic
effects and the APR and exercise. Carter et al.
59have
demonstrated an interaction between the processes ofthermal set point alteration viathe APR and exercise
hyperthermia, which alters the threshold at which ther-
moregulatory mechanisms are triggered, thus leading
to increased rate of heat accumulation on exercise anda greater than usual degree of hyperthermia. Thatseems consequential in humans because heat strokepatients have had frequently ( >50%) recent infec-
tion,
45,60,61suggesting that an APR compounds
increased heat accumulation. Stress-induced hyperther-mia (SIH) and the APR may also interact, they are
induced by different neurotransmitter pathways,
33and
also SIH and antimuscarinic drugs (see Ref. 62).
Knowledge of basic human heat physiology high-
lights how various other factors may affect heat stress innonathletic individuals and can rapidly reveal compro-mised heat coping ability due to reduced skin bloodﬂow (e.g., impaired cardiac output). Vascular volume iscritical to optimum cardiovascular system function and,
hence, thermoregulation, therefore, ﬂuid and sodium
loss must be balanced by supplementation.
63Reductions
in cardiac output progressively impair heat dissipationcapacity,
64and hypovolemia precipitates peripheral va-
soconstriction, with a consequent reduction of skinblood ﬂow, which diminishes heat dissipation by asmuch as eightfold.
65–67Cutaneous vasodilation, for
maximal heat loss, requires an increase in skin blood
ﬂow of 8 L/min.68–70Aged and ill individuals may have
maximum attainable cardiac outputs of approximately10 L/min (e.g., in heart failure, of moderate severity,maximum cardiac output during exercise is <10 L/
min
71). There is little leeway for added insults before
heat accumulation becomes inevitable, as a result of car-diovascular system inability to maintain the high skinblood ﬂows needed for higher rates of heat dissipation.
In summary, various different pathways, e.g., those
producing SIH, the APR, and acetyl-cholinergic input,deﬁnitely do interact and produce compounding effectson temperature dysregulation.

Thermoregulation: Acetylcholine and Dopamine
The known effects of antipsychotic drugs likely to be
relevant to thermoregulatory pathways are those on ace-
tylcholine (Ach) and dopamine (DA), which are bothpotently antagonistic and tend to increase body tempera-ture. However, the striking initial observation is thatthese effects do not commonly give rise to signiﬁcanttemperature elevation, nor is that a feature of suprathera-peutic doses or overdoses of such drugs
72,73(and Page
personal communication, March 16, 2009). This is true
both of selective antagonists of Ach and DA, and of
drugs that combine both effects, i.e., antipsychotics. DA3 NEUROLEPTIC MALIGNANT SYNDROME
Movement Disorders, Vol. 00, No. 00, 2010agonism in the preoptic area triggers increased heat loss,
which is blocked by DA antagonists and which reduces
the ability of rats to accommodate to a heat load,74prob-
ably D2 mediated.75DA transporter knockout mice
(DAT2/2) display functional hyperdopaminergia and
hyperactivity; their body temperature is signiﬁcantlylower than normal mice during inactive periods.
76
DA agonists, especially bromocriptine, have been used
as treatment; they are mostly also 5-HT2A receptor ago-nists.
77Since activation of 5-HT2A receptors worsens,
and antagonism reduces, the consequences of most forms
of hyperthermia,78–805-HT2A agonism is a undesirable
property. There is disagreement concerning bromocrip-tine’s efﬁcacy, and some evidence supports the notionthat it could worsen NMS.
81–83Apomorphine is the only
clinically available DA agonist that is also a 5-HT2Aantagonist and, therefore, may be preferable to bromoc-riptine.
84,85Central cholinergic M2 receptor agonism
mediates increased heat dissipation86promoting reduc-
tion of temperature, whereas antagonists like atropinereduce heat loss.
87Mice genetically engineered to lack
the M2 receptor showed reduced hypothermic responseto M receptor agonism, whereas in normal mice, agonismproduces pronounced hypothermic effects.
88
Heat stroke cases show a greatly increased likeli-
hood over controls to have been taking antimuscarinic
and antipsychotic drugs.44,89The role of antimuscarinic
mechanisms is underestimated, because there are manycommonly used drugs that have unrecognized antimus-carinic properties.
90,91
It is important to emphasize that overdoses of anti-
muscarinic drugs that are sufﬁciently severe to causedelirium are not generally associated with elevatedtemperature: e.g., in a series of 200 cases of prometha-
zine overdoses, only one case had a temperature of
>38.5 8C, and the average was not elevated
73(and
Page personal communication and Ref. 72). Reports ofhyperthermia subsequent to atropine or hyoscine arevery rare
62; but physostigmine is an effective treat-
ment, not only for delirium but also for the hyperther-mia.
62,92A number of authors have suggested that anti-
muscarinic drugs may be harmful in patients with
NMS and that they should be ceased if NMS with
hyperthermia is developing.7,93–98
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome
NMS, as it is usually deﬁned, has the major features:
mental state changes, bradykinesia and rigidity, auto-nomic dysfunction, and hyperthermia. The DSM crite-
ria include ‘‘elevated temperature,’’ which is not
deﬁned
13; the DSM features include 37.2 8C to 37.8 8C(expressed as 99 to 100 8F). As mentioned above, there
is usually an implicit or explicit acceptance that it is
also a ‘‘hypermetabolic’’ syndrome.
NMS is acknowledged to respond frequently to con-
servative management, after cessation of drugs, andmortality is estimated at about 10%
9: Caroff et al.18
states ‘‘NMS is a self-limited disorder in most cases,regardless of speciﬁc therapy’’ and that the complica-tions that may lead to fatalities are ‘‘Cardio-respiratoryarrest, acute renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, pulmonary
emboli, aspiration pneumonia ....’’ These usually occur
at temperatures lower than 39 8C. The central dopamine
hypoactivity hypothesis is widely accepted as a keyelement of the pathogenesis of NMS,
8and Mann and
Caroff99,100have proposed the spectrum of Catatonia—
NMS—Parkinson’s disease. An essential role for de-fective heat dissipation was proposed in 1988.
101
However, it is not meaningful to regard a substantial
proportion of patients (who meet formal diagnostic cri-
teria for NMS) as hyperthermic, since their tempera-tures do not exceed 38.5 8C: in Lee’s
5recent series
only 1 of 13 cases of NMS had a temperature of 39 8C
or greater. The effect of early recognition and treat-ment on those temperatures may not be great, since 7of 13 were less than 38 8C with only conservative treat-
ment (antipsychotics ceased, supportive measures, and
benzodiazepines). In Spivak et al.’s large prospective
series
102surveying 79,000 patients over 10 years, a
total 19 cases of NMS (0.02%), only 5 of 19 devel-oped temperature of >38.5 8C (2 were fatal, both had
recorded temperatures of a maximum of 39 8C). If these
temperatures represent true core temperatures, thenthey are most unlikely to be sufﬁciently great toaccount for the morbidities or mortality.
Muscle rigidity in NMS is abolished by neuromuscu-
lar blockade.
103–105This was veriﬁed using somatosen-
sory-evoked potentials, before and after an atracuriumbesilate bolus of 0.05 mg/kg, in a single recording ses-sion, in patients with NMS (N 57) and also Parkin-
son’s disease.
85In MH, rigidity is not abolished by neu-
romuscular blockade, because the pathology is withinthe muscle.
106The observation that neurogenic muscle
contraction (rigidity) associated with Parkinson’s dis-
ease (and other conditions), does not cause hyperther-mia, argues against a great degree of primary muscleheat generation in NMS; indeed, if thermoregulatorymechanisms are intact, it is doubtful that muscle con-traction alone is able to generate sufﬁcient heat toinduce hyperthermia. For comparison, current data indi-cate the maximum heat output in top athletes is approxi-
mately 20 j/s/kg,
107which generates an oxygen demand
of approximately 70 mL/kg/min.108In MH-susceptible4 P.K. GILLMAN
Movement Disorders, Vol. 00, No. 00, 2010swine, experiencing MH model hyperthermia, excess
oxygen demand only reaches 20 mL/kg/min.109,110
Thus, the heat generation in MH (approximated fromoxygen consumption) appears to be approximately 3times less than the total that the normally functioningsystem is able to dissipate. The slower rate of increaseand lower body temperatures in NMS (vs. MH) suggestthat excess heat production is less in NMS than it is inMH. This would seem to indicate NMS does notinvolve a degree of increased metabolism any greater
that the normally functioning system generates; so, it
may not be helpful to characterize that as hypermeta-bolic. The term hypermetabolic suggests increased heatproduction sufﬁcient to overwhelm a competent thermo-regulatory system. Also, the occurrence of acidosis andrhabdomyolysis, etc., per se , is not evidence of a hyper-
metabolic condition. However, experimental measure-ments are required to clarify these issues.
NMS-Like Syndromes
Many terms have been used for NMS-like syndromes,
and these have generally been considered very similar orthe same as NMS, both in presentation and etiol-ogy.
7,8,11,111The terms used include parkinsonism-
hyperpyrexia syndrome,7,112neuroleptic malignant-like
syndrome,113,114levodopa-withdrawal hyperthermia,
lethal hyperthermia,115dopaminergic malignant syn-
drome,116acute dopamine depletion syndrome,117aki-
netic crisis,118and acute akinesia,111which leads back to
Delay et al.’s original akinetic hypertonic syndrome.There is strong clinical evidence that multiple thermoreg-ulatory control mechanisms are relevant in a large pro-portion of these cases, viz, the thermoregulatory effects
of antipsychotic and antimuscarinic drugs (decreased
heat dissipation), the APR (surgery and infection), andthe dehydration/reduced cardiac output. The inﬂuence ofthe APR may have been underestimated, because meas-ures for establishing its presence are imperfect.
30
A prospective 12-year study described a cohort of
675 Parkinson’s disease patients, of which 26 patients(3% per year) developed Parkinson’s disease hyper-
thermia.
111,119In 17 of 26 instances, it presented after
the onset of infectious diseases or surgery (both ofwhich trigger the APR); and it occurred independentlyof treatment withdrawal, as it did in earlier descriptionsof neuroleptic malignant-like syndrome.
114,120,121In
Takubo et al.’s121large series, the most frequent pre-
cipitant was dose change and then intercurrent infec-tion, hot weather, and dehydration. Seventy-ﬁve (of
99) patients developed fever above 38 8C, and mean
maximum temperature was 38.5 8C.Long-term treatment with tetrabenazine, with or
without the tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor alpha-
methyl- p-tyrosine, induces profound DA depletion: in
/C24600 patients,
122–125this did not precipitate any cases
of NMS or hyperthermia in patients observed for manymonths (but did precipitate anxiety/depression in 15–20%). Nevertheless, cases of NMS with tetrabenazinehave been reported,
126–129but it is clearly rare in this
situation also. Ceasing treatment for Parkinson’s dis-ease also causes relative DA depletion but leads to
NMS or hyperthermia infrequently.
This well-documented occurrence of a syndrome
indistinguishable from NMS, without antipsychoticdrugs, demonstrates clearly that they are not the exclu-sive implicated agent. This has major implications forthe notion of causality (see ‘‘Hill’’ criteria below).
Malignant Hyperthermia
MH was once considered similar to NMS,
130but key
differences were evident early on. Among these were(1) a clear familial tendency, (2) triggering by speciﬁcdrugs (usually within 1 or 2 hours), (3) deﬁnite treat-ment response to dantrolene, (4) an identiﬁable abnor-
mality on muscle biopsy testing, and (5) a robust animal
model.
131These features have major implications for
considerations of cause-effect relationships, as particu-larized in the Table 1 below that compares NMS, ST,and MH using the Hill criteria for causality. MH is apharmacogenetic disorder of skeletal muscle precipi-tated by volatile anesthetic gases such as halothane andthe depolarizing muscle relaxant succinylcholine. The
estimates of incidence of MH reactions range from
1:5,000 to 1:50,000 anesthesias, and the typical signs ofMH are hyperthermia ( >398C), tachycardia, tachypnea,
increased carbon dioxide and oxygen consumption, aci-dosis, muscle rigidity, and rhabdomyolysis.
132Advan-
ces in genetics have now unraveled much of the storyand clariﬁed the relationship between the genotypes ofthis autosomal dominant disorder and the phenotypic
presentations, and the relationships to other similar con-
ditions. It is characterized by abnormal calcium ion con-trol in skeletal muscle, due (largely) to the various ryan-odine receptor mutations that have now been elucidatedin considerable detail in recent reviews.
133–135
DISCUSSION
NMS is a rare condition. NMS where the tempera-
ture exceeds 39 8C is even more rare. There is strong
evidence that many of the estimates of incidence have
methodological ﬂaws that produce substantial overesti-5 NEUROLEPTIC MALIGNANT SYNDROME
Movement Disorders, Vol. 00, No. 00, 2010mates of incidence. A review of NMS studies con-
cluded that, ‘‘study size accounts for 90% of the var-
iance in published estimates of NMS incidence.’’6
Large samples consistently indicate a lower incidence,
the range was from 30 per 1000 in the smallest studies,to as low as 0.17 to 0.2 per 1000 in the largest stud-ies
102,136; all the larger studies indicate lower rates of
less than 5 per 1000. The idea that, supported in thisarticle, NMS is not a homogeneous and unitary entityis not new,
137–140but has not received much attention,
perhaps because substantive evidence has not been
martialed to support it. Levinson and Simpson139com-
mented ‘‘The cases of extrapyramidal symptoms withfever are too heterogeneous to justify the assumptionof a unitary and malignant syndrome.’’
Two major issues, the deﬁnition and the etiology of
the condition, are intricately related to the question ofcausality. This is especially so because there are multi-
ple demonstrated and relevant mechanisms that are
capable of inﬂuencing temperature elevation andbecause there is no clear mechanism linking antipsy-chotic drugs with either frequent pathological tempera-ture disturbance or NMS itself. Nevertheless, it hasbeen generally implicitly accepted that there is acause-effect relationship linking antipsychotic drugswith NMS. The application of formal logical rules and
criteria has not been undertaken to substantiate this
notion, which, thus, cannot be assigned the formal sta-tus of a hypothesis. It is important to address this ques-tion of causality, because the answer has considerableinﬂuence on guiding research and possible active treat-ment strategies about which there is currently only amodest degree of consensus.
Criteria for establishing cause-effect relationships in
medical science, established by Sir Austin Bradford
Hill
141have recently been applied in several situations
similar to NMS142,143and reﬁnements have been dis-
cussed.144,145These criteria or considerations are, as
initially enumerated by Hill141: ‘‘1) Strength, 2) consis-
tency, 3) speciﬁcity, 4) temporality, 5) biological gra-dient (dose-effect), 6) plausibility, 7) coherence, 8)experiment, and 9) analogy’’ (see references for more
detailed expositions of these points).
Since NMS is often compared with both MH and
ST, it is helpful to illustrate how they all rate for cau-sality, using the Hill criteria (Table 1). From Table 1,it is immediately clear that there is a great differencebetween ST and MH on the one hand, and NMS onthe other, and that the evidence on NMS falls short ofa convincing case for causality. The most important
criteria that are not fulﬁlled are as follows: criterion
1—strength, the very infrequent association of DA-blocking/depleting drugs with either NMS or hyper-
thermia (especially when coupled with the lack of evi-
dence of genetic factors, compared with MH); criterion
2—consistency, is not satisfactorily met because of thelack of agreement about the deﬁnition of NMS, or‘‘caseness,’’ combined with large variations in theapparent observed rates of occurrence (a 100-fold dif-ference
6); criterion 3—speciﬁcity, is not satisﬁed,
because NMS is not speciﬁc to antipsychotic drugs,and its association with DA depletion is also very
infrequent
119; criterion 4—temporality and criterion
5—biological gradient (i.e., a dose-effect relationship)are connected. The fact that there is an almost com-plete absence of any hyperthermia or NMS followingsupratherapeutic doses or overdoses argues stronglyagainst any dose-effect relationship. The associationbetween low DA, from either idiopathic or iatrogeniccauses, and hyperthermia or NMS is very weak: in a
great majority of cases, they do not occur. Also, the
variation in interval to onset of NMS postdrug com-mencement, combined with the relatively low rates ofsubsequent recurrence on rechallenge (i.e., mostpatients can be safely reexposed to the drug after a rel-atively short interval
146) does not ﬁt the temporality
criterion. Criterion 6—plausibility, is especially uncon-vincing when it is recognized that no other therapeutic
dose single-drug ingestions predictably cause hyperther-
mia, that ODs do not lead to NMS or hyperthermia, andthat there is no well-supported pathophysiological mech-anism (as there is for both MH and ST). Similarly crite-ria 8—experiment, and 9—analogy offer no support,whereas for both MH and ST, they give strong support.This is especially pertinent when one appreciates thatMH is genetic and rare, yet there is clear familial pro-
pensity and a good animal model, and there is an animal
model for ST; but there is no familial propensity or use-ful animal model of NMS.
NMS is substantially less malignant than MH, either
as assessed by the rate of onset of hyperthermia or theultimate percentage of fatalities. MH is frequently fatalwithin hours, unless aggressive active treatment isinstituted. In NMS (and parkinsonism-hyperpyrexia
syndrome), a majority of cases do not ever develop the
degree of hyperthermia usually associated with morbid-ity (i.e., 39.5 8C or greater), even with only conserva-
tive treatment. Also, deterioration of clinical status andmorbidity and mortality occur in the absence of adegree of hyperthermia that is injurious: deteriorationof renal, mental, neurological, and respiratory function,despite a maximum temperature of less than 39 8C, is
documented in many reports.
5,83,102,121To regard NMS
as a primarily hyperthermic syndrome is an inadequate6 P.K. GILLMAN
Movement Disorders, Vol. 00, No. 00, 2010explanatory model and may lead to underestimation of
clinical severity or exclusion of NMS because the
patient is not hyperthermic.
Thermoregulatory redundancy is sufﬁciently great,
so that a concatenation of circumstances and disrup-tions is required to precipitate signiﬁcant hyperthermia.Even concurrent antagonism of Ach and DA does notusually cause hyperthermia. Hyperthermic states usu-ally result from combinations of factors and mecha-nisms, as described and illustrated above. Various fac-
tors are associated with the temperature elevation in
NMS and NMS-like syndromes, more frequently thangenerally recognized. Temperature elevation appears toshow features of both hyperthermia and fever. Carteret al.’s
59recent demonstration of the compounding
effect of an APR (due to acute infection) and exertionis important, as is Noakes et al.’
38with SIH and exer-
cise. Particularly, the factors often seen that have been
shown to have compounding interactive effects are
high physical activity, high ambient temperatures,stress and agitation (i.e., SIH), an APR, impaired skinblood ﬂow, and impaired sweat production (e.g., fromantimuscarinic drug effects, dehydration, or cardiacfailure). These interactions are important, sometimesfatal, and must be assumed to contain lessons for mod-els of NMS. It is proposed that collectively the co-
occurrence and interaction of these factors contribute
to that small proportion (approximately one tenth) ofNMS cases that do become seriously hyperthermic.
Both DA and Ach inﬂuence CNS temperature con-
trol in the same direction and stimulation of therelevant postsynaptic receptors (D2 and M2), in thepreoptic area promotes heat loss. The DA agonist, apo-morphine, has been used to treat NMS with apparent
good results
117,119,147–151and is also a 5-HT2A antago-
nist (unlike bromocriptine, which is a 5-HT2A ago-nist
152). The acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, physostig-
mine and tacrine, are rapidly effective in the antimus-carinic toxidrome,
62,72,73,92although they are very
rarely required speciﬁcally for the treatment of hyper-thermia. It is important to repeat that overdoses of anti-muscarinic drugs (that are sufﬁciently severe to cause
delirium) are not generally associated with hyperther-
mia, nor are overdoses of DA antagonists (antipsy-chotic drugs, most of which also posses signiﬁcantantimuscarinic potency). The case reported by Tor-line
62is remarkable for the interaction of SIH and sco-
polamine, co-occurrence of previous severe anxietyattacks (accompanied by well-documented temperatureelevation, i.e., SIH) and then a temperature of 42 8C
soon after preoperative scopolamine administration,
which rapidly normalized after physostigmine.The method, site, and accuracy of temperature meas-
urements require continuing critical attention. Research
harnessing recent technologies to measure temperature
changes in muscle, skin, core, and brain has becomepossible and is a high priority. Such measurementswould put theorizing on a ﬁrm base: a fundamentalunaddressed question is, does NMS involve excess gen-eration, or failed dissipation, of heat: Is sufﬁcient excessheat being generated in muscle (or other organs) toaccount for temperature increase and morbidity, or not?
The high temperatures reached, in a small proportion of
cases, accompanied by prolonged diaphoresis and evi-dence of muscle injury, suggests a possibility of excessmuscle heat generation. But, evidence from heat pro-duction in athletes and oxygen consumption in MHcompared with athletes does not support NMS beinghypermetabolic to a degree sufﬁcient to overwhelm nor-mally functioning thermoregulatory mechanisms. Firm
evidence is required and is obtainable. Temperature
mapping of the brain, and other tissues, is now possibleviamagnetic resonance spectroscopy, which has been
used to study the brains of piglets and humans. Protonresonance frequency provides absolute temperaturemeasurements.
153–155Also, ingestible temperature sen-
sor capsules could be utilized. They are accurate andcorrelate well with rectal temperature.
42,156Infrared au-
ral/tympanic thermometers are neither adequate for
research nor even for routine clinical use, because theyare neither accurate nor do they measure tympanicmembrane temperature.
41
An ironic lesson of NMS research is the inadequate
attention given, both to assessing causality and to themost fundamental (and accurately measurable) physicalparameter, temperature. The importance of answering
the question about causality and heat generation can
hardly be overstated. The answers will indicate whatkind of treatment approach is most logical. Reducingmuscle rigidity with dantrolene, which remains contro-versial, will not be the optimal strategy if the problemis reduced heat dissipation, and focusing on tempera-ture and cooling is insufﬁcient if morbidity is, to somedegree, independent of temperature.
