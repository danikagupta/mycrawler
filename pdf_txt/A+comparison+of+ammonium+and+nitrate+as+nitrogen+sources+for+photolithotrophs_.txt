 2 Abstract  21 
Terrestrial plant growth and ecosystem productivity are strongly limited by availability of 22 
nitrogen (N). Atmospheric deposition of wet N as nitrate and ammonium has been rapidly 23 
increased  since the industrial revolution , associated with  a high  spatial  variation of  changes in  24 
the ammonium - to nitrate -N ratio (i.e., NH 4+-N/NO 3--N). However, whether and how terrestrial 25 
plants respond differently to  NH 4+-N and NO 3--N addition  have never been quantitatively 26 
synthesized . Here, we first  did a literature survey and analysis on the model projections of future 27 
changes in NH 4+-N/NO 3--N in atmospheric N deposition. Most models predict ed an increase in 28 
the global average of NH 4+-N/NO 3--N ratio , but decreasing trends in western Europe a nd eastern 29 
China. Then, a meta -analysis was applied to compare  the different growth responses of 402 30 
plant species to NH 4+-N and NO 3--N addition from  217 N fertilization studies . In general, a 31 
greater response of plant growth to NH 4+- N (+6.3% g-1 N) than NO 3--N (+1.0% g-1 N) addition 32 
was detected across all species . The larger sensitivity of plant growth to NH 4+- than NO 3--N 33 
was found in all plant functional types except for grasses. In addition, the NO 3--N addition 34 
promoted terrestrial plants to allocate more biomass to above -ground, whereas  NH 4+-N addition 35 
significantly enhanced below - but not above -ground growth. These results imply  that the global 36 
accelerating  N deposition could stimulate plant growth more in regions with increasing (e.g., 37 
North America ) than decreasing (e.g., eastern China) NH 4+-N/NO 3--N ratio. The finding s 38 
suggest future  assessments and predictions on  the vegetation response to atmospheric N 39 
enrichment could benefit fr om a better understanding of plant strategies for acquiring different 40 
forms of N.  41

 3 1. Introduction  43 
Nitrogen (N) is the most abundant element in the atmosphere and an essential component for 44 
organisms on land and in the sea (Vitousek & Howarth , 1991).  The deposition rate of 45 
atmospheric N to land has dramatically increased by about three  folds since the industrial  46 
revolu tion, and is  expected to be even faster  in the future  (Galloway et al., 2008; Kanakidou  et 47 
al., 2016 ). The loading of N in wet deposition mainly has two different forms, including 48 
ammonium and nitrate. Recent observations have shown large spatial differences in the shifting 49 
trend of the composition in N deposition  (i.e., a mmonium vs. nitrate) . For example, N 50 
deposition is shifting from nitrate - to ammonium -dominated  in the United States ( Du et al., 51 
2014; Li et al., 2016 ), but a contrasting change  is observed  in China ( Liu et al., 2013, 2016 ). 52 
The high N deposition rate has been acknowledged to enhance  plant growth and  primary 53 
productivity in most terrestrial ecosystems ( LeBauer & Treseder, 2008; Xia & Wan, 2008;  54 
Fernandezmartinez  et al., 2014 ). The N-enhanced plant growth has become critical in sustaining 55 
the major functions of terrestrial ecosystems, such as fueling all life on land (Zhu et al., 2002 ; 56 
Smil , 2004 ) and absorbing more atmospheric CO 2 to mitigate climate change  (Schimel, 1995; 57 
De Vries  et al., 2014; Maaroufi et al., 2015 ). Thus, the functions of terrestrial ecosystem is 58 
largely  affected by both the changes in composition of the plant -available N and the different 59 
effects betwe en ammonium and nitrate  addition on plant growth. However , neither of these two 60 
impacts  has so far  been evaluated . 61 
Anthropogenic activities are altering both total N loads and the dominant form of N 62 
deposition. Also, global fertilizer use has generally shifted from oxidized to reduced form of N, 63 
with urea use now > 50% of global N fertilizer, surpassing nitrate  as the most common N 64 
fertilizer worldwide (Glibert et al., 2006).  In addition, t he availability of  ammonium (NH 4+-N) 65 
and nitrate ( NO 3--N) in the soil could be differently affect by  the changes of global 66 
environmental factors . For example, field experiments with adding N usually increase the 67 
concentration of soil NH 4+-N less than NO 3--N (Lu et al., 2011), wh ereas  CO 2 enrichment 68 
stimulates soil NH 4+-N to NO 3--N ratio (NH 4+-N/NO 3--N) but not NH 4+-N or NO 3--N 69 
concentration (Liang et al., 2016).  Thus, a survey on the future global changes of the NH 4+- 70 
N/NO 3--N ratio in the projected atmospheric N deposition  as well as  the impacts of N addition 71 
on soil NH 4+-N/NO 3--N are necessary.  72 
Although plants utilize other forms of N such as nitrite and amino acids as well , they 73 
mainly uptake ammonium and nitrate under natural conditions (Olsson  & Falkengren -Grerup , 74 Biogeosciences Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2018-124

 4 2000).  Ammonium  is mainly originat ed from agriculture (including human and animal 75 
excrement, and fertilizer volatilization), while  nitrate  mainly stems from fossil -fuel combustion 76 
by power plants and automobiles  (Hosker  & Lindberg, 1982 ). Although NH 4+-N and NO 3--N 77 
are considered equivalent in most N fertilization experiments  (Stevens et al., 2004; Manning et 78 
al., 2006) , a number of recent  studies have reported  different ial N preference  among  plant 79 
species ( ven den Berg et al., 2016 ; Glibert et al., 2016; Tho et al., 2017 ). For example , plant  80 
species  that grows in  calcareous or slightly acidic soils  favor nitrate or a combination of nitrate 81 
and ammonium, whereas plants in acidic habitats p refer to uptake ammonium (Gigon  & Rorison, 82 
1972; De Graaf et al. , 1998 ; Falkengren -Grerup  & Schottelndreier, 2004; Sheppard et al., 2014) . 83 
Plant species of different functional types vary in N use strategy and thus respond differently 84 
to N addition (Xia & Wan , 2008 ). However, it is unclear whether the preference of plant growt h 85 
for N form also varies among plant function types. For some  plant species , the addition of NH 4+- 86 
N appear s to be toxic for plant growth  (ven den Berg et al., 2005; De Schrijver et al., 2008 ), 87 
while other  studies have emphasized  that the  toxic effect might be limited to certain plant 88 
functional groups ( e.g. bryophyte; Paulissen et al., 2005; Verhoeven et al., 2011 ) or depend s on 89 
soil properties  (ven den berg et al., 2005; Li et al., 2014 ). During the past a few decades, a 90 
tremendous amount of manipulative studies have conducted to study the response of plant 91 
species to N addition ( Piwpuan  et al., 2013 ; Maaroufi  et al., 2015; ven Den Berg  et al., 2016 ). 92 
Most of these studies have reported the form of added N and the functional type of plant species . 93 
These studies enable  a quantitative synthesis on the different impacts between a mmonium  and 94 
nitrate additions on plant growth.  95 
In this study, we applied  a weighted meta -analysis of  observed plant response to  N add ition 96 
from 217 manipulative experiments . The effect of different N forms (nitrate, ammonium, 97 
NH 4NO 3 and urea) on plant growth  was calculated across the globe  and compared among plant 98 
functional types. This major question of this study is whether and how the effects of  nitrate on 99 
plant growth is different from that of  ammonium . Because many ecological studies are using 100 
NH 4NO 3 or urea as the fertilizer , we also aim to compar e their effects on plant growth  with the 101 
nitrate and ammonium  additions.  102

 5 We searched ISI Web of Science, PubMed, Google Scholar, and JSTOR with the terms of 106 
“nitrogen fertilization (or N addition or N deposition)”  and “plant biomass (or plant growth)”. 107 
Then, papers meeting the following criteria were selected to do the further analysis:  108 
(i) The study included both control and N treatments. If N was added together with other 109 
treatments (e.g. CO 2 enrichment), we took the effect of additional treatment (e.g. CO 2 110 
enrichment) as the control, and their combined effect (e.g. CO 2 enrichment plus N 111 
addition) as the N treatment;  112 
(ii) The biomass responses to N addition was reported at the species level. Means,  sample 113 
sizes, and standard deviations under both the control and N addition treatments were 114 
provided;  115 
(iii) The N forms, including nitrate (NO 3--N), ammonium (NH 4+-N), ammonium nitrate 116 
(NH 4NO 3) and urea, were clarified in the study, and also the N dose was measured as N 117 
per unit area (g N m-2); 118 
(iv) Crop species were excluded from our analysis.  119 
Overall, there were totally 198 papers, 402 species and 2709 data included in the data set 120 
1 (Supporting information Notes S 1). The data of means and variations in both c ontrol and N 121 
addition treatments were collected directly from original tables or extracted from the figure 122 
using SigmaScan (Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). The global distribution of study 123 
sites was showed in the Figure 1. A list of the species and their original studies could be found 124 
in the supplementary Table S1. 125 
2.1.2.  Response of soil nitrogen availability to N addition  126 
To evaluate the responses of soil NH 4+-N/NO 3--N ratio under future  enhanced  N addition , we 127 
collected updated  the dataset  of Lu et al. (2011) on the ISI Web of Science . We only used the 128 
results from 29 papers which reported the effect of N fertilization  on soil NH 4+-N or NO 3--N 129 
pool. Only those  studies with NH 4NO 3 and urea addition  were included , because these two 130 
fertilizers are mostly widely used  (Supporting information Notes S 2). Meta -analyses were used 131 
to estimate the effects of N addition  on soil NH 4+-N, NO 3--N and the ratio of NH 4+-N/NO 3--N. 132 
Other factors, e.g. the treatment of application, interactive climate variables, or the species 133 
information were not consider ed in this analysis . 134

 6 To estimate the trend of atmospheric N deposition, we did a literature survey on the modelled 136 
patterns of future N deposition  (i.e., total deposited N, NH x, NO y, and the ratio of NH x/NO y). 137 
The projected trends of N deposition  from different literatures  were presented in the  Table 1. 138 
The trend of global gridded (0.5° × 0.5° )  NH x/NO y over 2010 -2100  were analyzed based on the 139 
environmental driver data sets  for the Multi -scale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model 140 
Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP)  project  (Huntzinger  et al., 2013 ; Wei et al., 2015 ) 141 
(https://daac.ornl.gov/cgi -bin/dsviewer.pl?ds_id=1220 ). The gridded time -varying N 142 
deposition  was derived from the map in Dentener (2006), which provided the maps of global N 143 
deposition in 1860, 1993, and 2050. The ratio of NH x/NO y was calculated at each 0.5° × 0.5°  144 
grid in each year from 2010 to 2100. The trend of NH x/NO y in each grid during 2010 -2100  was 145 
extracted from the linear regression analysis . 146 
2.2. Statistical analyses  147 
2.2.1. Soil ammonium  to nitrate  ratio ( NH 4+-N/ NO 3--N)  148 
When both soil ammonium ( NH 4+-N) and nitrate ( NO 3--N) concentration with the same unit 149 
were provided in one study, the soil NH 4+/NO 3- ratio were calculated as below:  150 
X=𝑋𝑁𝐻4+
𝑋𝑁𝑂3−                                                                                                                                       (1) 151 
where 𝑋𝑁𝐻 4+ and 𝑋𝑁𝑂 3−  are means of the soil and ammonium  and nitrate concentration. Its 152 
standard deviation  was estimated by:  153 
𝑆𝑐=√(𝑆𝑁𝐻4+
𝑋𝑁𝐻4+)2
+(𝑆𝑁𝑂3−
𝑋𝑁𝑂3−)2
                                                                                                        (2)      154 
where 𝑆𝑁𝐻 4+ and 𝑆𝑁𝑂 3− are the SD of soil nitrate and ammonium concentration , respectively .  155 
2.2.2. The relative response of plant growth to N addition  156 
The meta -analysis followed the techniques described in Hedges et al.,  (1999) , Wan et al. , (2001) 157 
and Xia & Wan (2008).  In this study, N was added in various amounts ( Namount ; g N m-2) among 158 
studies, so we first normalized the plant growth  and its variation of the N treatment as:  159 
𝑋𝑒′=𝑋𝑐+𝑋𝑒−𝑋𝑐

𝑁𝑎𝑚𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡                                                                                                                         (4) 161 
where 𝑋𝑐 (or 𝑆𝑐) and 𝑋𝑒 (or 𝑆𝑒) are the means (or standard deviation) of the biomass 162 
response in the control  and N addition  treatments, respectively.  𝑋𝑒′ and 𝑆𝑒′ represent the mean 163 
and standard deviation of plant growth  under the treatment of per unit amount ( g N m-2) of N 164 
addition.  Then, t he relative response  (RR) of plant biomass  to per unit amount of N addition 165 
was calculated as the  log-transformed ratio : 166 
𝑅𝑅=ln(𝑋𝑒′
𝑋𝑐)                                                                                                                                 (5) 167 
with the variance as:  168 
𝑣𝑅𝑅=(𝑆𝑐)2
𝑛𝑒(𝑋𝑐)2+(𝑆𝑒′)2
𝑛𝑒(𝑋𝑒′)2                                                                                                         (6) 169 
where 𝑛𝑐and 𝑛𝑒 represent the sample size  for control and treatment, respectively.  The 170 
reciprocal of its variance ( 𝑤=1
𝑣𝑅𝑅) was considered as the weight of each RR. Then the mean 171 
response ratio ( RR++) and its standard error were calculated as : 172 
𝑅𝑅 ++=∑ ∑ 𝑤𝑖𝑗𝑅𝑅 𝑖𝑗𝑘𝑖
𝑗=1𝑚
𝑖=1
∑ ∑ 𝑤𝑖𝑗𝑘𝑖
𝑗=1𝑚
𝑖=1                                                                                                         （7） 173

𝑖=1                                                                                                           （8） 174 
where m is the number of groups , and 𝑘𝑖 is the number of comparisons in the 𝑖th group . The 175 
95% confidence interval (95% CI) was  calculated as  𝑅𝑅 ++±  1.96  𝑆(𝑅𝑅 ++) by bootstrapping 176 
the data using Metawin 2.0. The percentage changes were presented in the figures as  back 177 
transformed from the log response ratio (i.e., [exp(𝑅𝑅 ++)−1]×100% ). 178 
The effects of nitrogen addition on plant growth  were evaluated as significant, if the 95% 179 
CI overlap zero. This meta -analysis also followed the theory of heterogeneity descr ibed by 180 
Gurevitch & Hedges (1993), in which total heterogeneity ( QT) is divided into within -group ( Qw) 181 
and between -group ( Qb). If Qb is larger than a critical value, there would be significant 182 
difference between categories. Statistical significance was tested at the P < 0.05 level.  183 Biogeosciences Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2018-124

 8 For meta -analysis, some researchers have advocated the inclusion of only one result from 184 
each study becau se the assumption of independence (Vanderwerf , 1992). However, the 185 
omission of multiple results in each study would cause the loss of information, which may be a 186 
more serious problem than violation the assumption of independence (Gurevitch & Hedges, 187 
1993).  Thus, we included more than one results from a single study in this meta -analysis, whose 188 
reliability (or feasibility) had been tested by previous meta -analyses (Maestre et al., 2005). 189 
Actually, we also compared the results with using all data and with using one data from each 190 
study, and found these patterns were unchanged.  191 
3. Results  192 
3.1. Changes of N forms in the atmosphere and soil  193 
According to  the literature survey , although the global estimate varies largely  among models , 194 
the atmospheric N  deposition ha s substantial ly increase d since the 1850s ( Table 1 ). The total N 195 
deposition has increased by a factor of about 3 at present (135 ± 5 Tg N  yr-1) since 1850 ( 51±1.8 196 
Tg N yr-1). This accelerated N deposition is mainly owing to the large increase of reduced (NH x) 197 
and oxidised (NO y) N (Table 1, modelled by TM4 -ECPL ). The global total N deposition is not 198 
expected to change much  in the nearly future (2050, 138±6 Tg N  yr-1). However,  the ratio of 199 
reduced to oxidised N (i.e., NH x/NO y) modelled by TM4 -ECPL  would be  increased up to 2.0 200 
at 2050, which is almost doubled from 2005 . The fast increase in global NH x/NO y in the future 201 
was consistent with that derived from the MsTMIP environmental data. However, the trend of 202 
NH x/NO y was decreasing in some regions, such as the southeastern China and western Europe 203 
(Fig. 2).   204 
In the manipulative experiments, t he ratio of NH 4+-N/ NO 3--N in the soil was differently 205 
influenced  by N deposition  (Fig. 3). Manipulative N addition significantly decreased the ratio 206 
of NH 4+/NO 3- by stimulating  NO 3--N (+356 .0%) more than NH 4+-N (+60.0%; Fig. 3a). 207 
3.2. Responses of plant growth to additive N forms vary with plant functional types  208 
Across all the plant species, plant growth was more increased by the addition of  NH 4+-N (6.3% 209 
g-1 N) than  NO 3--N (1.0% g-1 N) (Qb =36.8, P < 0.001; Fig. 4a, Table 2). This  higher positive 210 
effect of NH 4+-N than NO 3--N was found  in all plant functional groups  except  for grasse s, which 211 
oppositely respond less to  NH 4+-N (6.9% g-1 N) than NO 3--N (11.1% g-1 N) addition  (Qb =3.5, 212 Biogeosciences Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2018-124

 9 P =0.06; Table 2). The positive effects of NH 4+-N addition  were comparable between woody  213 
(5.6% g-1 N) and herbaceous ( 6.9% g-1 N) species  (Qb =1.7, P >0.1; Table 3), but a smaller 214 
response  of herbaceous  (1.6% g-1 N) and woody species ( 0.6% g-1 N) (Qb =0.6, P >0.1; Table 215 
3) was detected to NO 3--N addition . The positive effects of NH 4+-N addition among different 216 
functional types had no significant difference, with the rank of g rasses (6.9% g-1 N), forbs (6.9% 217 
g-1 N), trees (6.5% g-1 N) and shrub s (3.2% g-1 N) (Qb =8.2, P =0. 08; Table 3). However, grasses 218 
(11.1% g-1 N) respond more than  shrubs ( 1.9% g-1 N), trees (1.6% g-1 N) and forbs  (-0.8% g-1 219 
N) to NO 3--N addition ( Qb =26.0, P <0. 001;  Table 3 ).  220 
Across all species , the response of plant growth to  NH 4NO 3 addition ( 5.5% g-1 N) was 221 
comparable to  NH 4+-N addition  (Fig. 4b) . No significant  difference was detected between 222 
NH 4NO 3 and NH 4+-N effect for each plant functional type , except trees (P <0.05 ). Urea addition 223 
showed greater positive effects  across all species ( 11.0% g-1 N) than both NH 4+-N and NO 3--N 224 
addition. Its positive impacts were the largest in all plant functional types (e.g., 9.0% g-1 N and 225 
15.4% g-1 N in woody and herbaceous species , respectively ) (Table 2). 226 
3.3. Responses of plant growth to NH 4+- and NO 3--N addition vary with plant tissues  227 
NO 3--N addition significantly stimulated the growth  of above -ground ( 8.4% g-1 N), whereas 228 
NH 4+-N addition showed greater effect on the below -ground growth ( 5.9% g-1 N; Fig. 5a, Table 229 
2). NH 4+-N addition significantly increased below -ground ( 7.3% g-1 N and 9.4% g-1 N) but not 230 
above -ground growth  of both woody and herbaceous species. In contrast, NO 3--N addition  231 
significant ly increased the above -ground ( 4.0% g-1 N and 12.1% g-1 N) but no t below -ground 232 
growth  of both woody and herbaceous species (Fig. 5b, c). 233 
4. Discussions  234 
4.1. Future trends of global atmospheric N deposition and soil N availability  235 
Once the anthropogenic reactive N compounds are  emitted into the atmosphere, they are 236 
deposited to the biosphere quickly (Galloway et al., 2008). The major compounds of reactive 237 
N are NH x and NO y. The survey of modeling projections in this study shows an increasing 238 
NH x/NO y ratio globally in the coming d ecades ( Table 1 ). This trend suggests that the impacts 239 
of future N  deposition on terrestrial plant growth could be more dominated by NH 4+-N than 240 
NO 3--N. However, it should be noted that the projections in Table 1 are highly uncertain, 241 Biogeosciences Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2018-124

 10 because model simulations in different projects are usually driven by different purposes and 242 
assumptions. Also, because both NH x and NO y are short -lived gases , and thus a global average 243 
cannot reflect the  large spatial variation of the trends in  the NH 4+/NO 3- ratio (Fig. 2 ). For 244 
example, the wet N deposition across the US has been dominated by NO 3--N in the 1980s but 245 
has recently been shifted to be dominated by NH 4+-N (Li et al., 2016). In China, however, both 246 
the ratios of  NH x/NO y and NH 4+/NO 3- have been significantly reduced since 1980s (Liu et al., 247 
2013, 2016).   248 
Because NH 4+-N could be transformed into NO 3--N via nitrification, so  it remains unclear 249 
that how the change of NH 4+-N/NO 3--N in the  atmospheric N deposition will affect the soil N 250 
availability to plants . It has been demonstrated  that the increasing atmospheric N deposition  not 251 
only stimulates  the availability of mineral N, but also leads to  a shifted NH 4+-N/NO 3--N ratio 252 
in the soil ( De Graaf  et al. , 1998 ; Seinfeld & Pandis, 2016).  For example, a  synchronous change  253 
of NH 4+-N/NO 3--N ratio and pH  in throughfall and soil  has been observed in  a 22 -year 254 
measurement  in Netherland  (Boxman et al. , 2008) . These results suggest that terrestrial plants 255 
will experienc e a different soil NH 4+-N/NO 3--N ratio because of the changing N deposition 256 
pattern  (Seinfeld and Pandis, 2016 ). As shown in this study, the soil NH 4+-N/NO 3--N ratio tends 257 
to reduce under experimental N addition . Thus,  the different responses of plant growth to NH 4+- 258 
N and NO 3--N addition is critical for future projection of terrestrial vegetation growth and 259 
ecosystem productivity.  260 
4.2. Different responses of plant growth to NH 4+- and NO 3--N addition among  plant 261 
functional types  262 
There has been a long history of research investigating the physiological and ecological 263 
consequences of plant species’ preference for acquiring NH 4+-N or NO 3--N (Lee & Stewart, 264 
1978; Raven et al., 1992; Kronzucker et al., 1997 ; Sheppard  et al., 2014 ; Tho et al., 2017 ). In 265 
this study, the sensitivity of plant growth to NH 4+-N addition is about 6-fold higher than that to 266 
NO 3--N addition (Fig. 4). The larger effect of NH 4+-N than NO 3--N addition on plant growth is 267 
reasonable, because ammonium is more energetically favorable and less energe tically costly  268 
than nitrate, which has to be reduced to ammonium before assimilation  (Guo et al., 2 007).  For 269 
example, ammonium was reported to be superior to nitrate for growth of rice (Qian et al., 2004) 270 
or Cyperus laevigatus  (Piwpuan et al., 2013)  and other macrophytes (Konnerup & Brix, 2010; 271 
Tho et al., 2017) . Thus, the NH 4+-N uptake by plants often exceeds that of NO 3--N when N is 272 
the limiting nutrient ( ven den Berg  et al., 2005; De Schrijver et al., 2 008). A higher uptake rate 273 Biogeosciences Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2018-124

 11 of NH 4+-N means a higher tissue N concentration and then a higher content of proteins in the 274 
tissue, which can be reflected in the photosynthetic capacity of the plants (Br ück & Guo, 2006; 275 
Konnerup & Brix, 2010). Larger stimulation of CO 2 assimilation rate by NH 4+-N than that of 276 
NO 3--N addition has been found in many studies (Claussen & Lenz, 1999; Terce -Laforgue et 277 
al., 20 04). Given to the increasing trend of ammonium -dominance in N deposition  in most 278 
regions  (Table 1 and Fig. 2), terrestrial plant growth is likely to  be more enhanced by  future  N 279 
enrichment due to its higher sensitivity to  NH 4+-N than NO 3--N addition . 280 
Although  plants acquire  NH 4+-N more efficient ly than NO 3--N in terms of energy cost, the 281 
presence of free NH 4+ in plant cells is v ery toxic (Britto et al., 2001). For example , ammonium 282 
supplied as the sole nitrogen source usually inhibit s plant  growth compared to nitrate or a 283 
mixture of nitrate and ammonium ( Gerend ás et al., 1997; Guo et al., 2002). A numerous of pot 284 
control experiments and field isotope labelling studies have  also pointed out that higher NH 4+ 285 
uptake rates may accomplish by potential risk of cell acidification, deficiencies of metal ions , 286 
and inhibiti on on root  growth  (Li et al., 2014; Sarasketa et al., 2016). Also,  NH 4+-N addition 287 
could  result in reduction in leaf expansion rate and root water uptake capacity, which may lead 288 
to a low carbon accumulation and an inhibition on growth (Guo et al., 2002;  Brü ck  & Guo, 289 
2006). Furthermore, NH 4+-N addition show a higher stimulation on plant growth but a lower 290 
variability among plant functional types than NO 3--N addition (Fig. 4). It suggests  that future  291 
N deposition with more NH 4+-N input will more evenly enhance the growth of different plant 292 
functional types. It is interesting that NO 3--N addition only enhances growth of grasses but not 293 
of other plant functional types (Fig. 4) , suggesting the nitrate -dominated N deposition could 294 
affect grassland more than other types of ecosystem.  It should be also noted that the ratio of 295 
NH x/NO y in N deposition shows contrasting trends between the grasslands in the North 296 
America and Europe (Fig. 2). These result s call for more research efforts on the di fferent 297 
impacts of NH 4+-N and NO 3--N addition on community composition  in the future . 298 
4.3. Different responses of plant growth to NH 4+- and NO 3--N addition among  plant tissues  299 
It has been known that  ammonium has to be assimilated immediately at the root, while  nitrates 300 
could be stored in the vacuoles before the assimilation  (Marchner, 2012 ). Due to t his immediate 301 
assimilation, ammonium uptake demand s a high er quantity of carbon skeletons . As a 302 
consequen ce, a higher fraction of root carbon would be consumed  by plants  for acquiring  NH 4+- 303 
N than NO 3--N (Cramer & Lewis, 1993; Gerend ás et al., 1997 ). This could lead to root growth  304 
suppression  under NH 4+-N supply ( Bloom et al., 1992; Walch -Liu et al., 2000; Esteban et al., 305 Biogeosciences Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2018-124

 12 2016). However, inconsist ent with previous studies, our meta -analysis results show ed that 306 
below -ground growth is stimulated more by NH 4+-N additio n (5.9% g-1 N), whereas above - 307 
ground growth is more sensitive to NO 3--N addition ( 8.4% g-1 N) across all growth forms.  308 
This unexpected response suggests  more resources allocation  to root under the increased 309 
NH 4+-N supply.  More carbon  supply  to root could reduce some risks, such as the NH 4+ toxicity  310 
(Roosta & Schjoerring, 2008; Vega -Mas et al., 2015) , to plant growth . In addition, r eduction of 311 
leaf growth, thus, may represent a  protective mechanism in order to keep a balance between  312 
lowered root water -uptake capacity and the high carbon  demand for control of net NH 4+ uptake 313 
by roots.  Furthermore,  plants grown with NH 4+-N environment are more sensitive to light stress 314 
than that grown  under NO 3--N supply  (Zhu et al., 2000; Setié n et al., 2013 ). It suggests that  315 
plants  under NH 4+-N supply would invest more resources into below -ground for acquiring NH 4+ 316 
and water. The se results indicate  that plants have evolved different  specialized strategies to  317 
adapt to  the changing N environments.  318 
4.4. Implications and limitations  319 
The findings in this study have some important implications for the widespread N -addition 320 
manipulative experiments. First,  NH 4NO 3 and urea are  widely used as  the major fertilizer s in 321 
most  field ecological experiments . We found the  NH 4NO 3 addition shows a similar effect as the 322 
NH 4+-N addition, but detected  a greater stimulation of urea addition on plant growth  (Fig. 4b). 323 
This suggests the N effect on  plant growth in the manipulative experiments could be larger than 324 
that in the natural ecosystems, especially in those  regions  with increasing deposition of NO 3-- 325 
N. Second, the ratio of NH 4+-N/NO 3--N in the soil is increased under the addition of NH 4NO 3 326 
or urea (Fig. 3d). However, the increasing ratio of NH 4+-N/NO 3--N in wet N deposition usually  327 
eventually enhances the NH 4+-N/NO 3--N ratio in the soil (Boxman et al., 2008; Seinfeld & 328 
Pandis, 2016 ). Due to the contrasting impacts of NH 4+-N and NO 3--N addition on biomass 329 
allocation, a ttentions should be paid to the scaling of experimental results up to the real 330 
ecosystems. Third, plant growth is more sensitive to NH 4+-N than NO 3--N addition in most 331 
plant functional types except for grasses. It suggests that the composition of N deposition could 332 
be important in affecting the community structure in grassland  ecosystems . 333 
It should be noted that there are some limitations in this study. First, the meta -analysis 334 
combines results from previous studies to calculate a weighted average of the measure, or 335 
identify patterns based on results from different studies. However, the weighted effect  could  be 336 Biogeosciences Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2018-124

 13 affected by factors such as the criteria for searching studies  and the uneven sample size among  337 
individual studies. To further test the robustness of the key findings in this study, we studied the  338 
experiments  which simultaneously a ddition of  NH 4+- and NO 3--N (totally 42 paired data and 12 339 
species from 7 independent studies , Supporting information  Table S2 ). The results ( Supporting 340 
information  Fig. S1) were consistent with the general patterns that found in Fig. 4. Second, this 341 
study tried to discuss the plant preference for N forms under the background of the 342 
compositional shift in atmospheric N deposition. However, the increasing NH x/NO y ratio in the 343 
atmospheric N deposition  does not necessary lead to enhanced  NH 4+-N/NO 3--N in the soil, 344 
because NH 4+ could be quickly transformed to NO 3- by nitrification. Although there is evidence 345 
of associated changes between ratios of atmospheric NH x/NO y and soil  NH 4+-N/NO 3--N at the 346 
site level (e.g., Boxman et al., 2008 ), further research is still needed. Third, some of the 347 
discussion is based on the global trends of atmospheric NH x/NO y, but the projection itself has 348 
great uncertainty.  349 
5. Summary  350 
In general,  this study found a higher response of plant growth to ammonium than nitrate 351 
addition  in terrestrial ecosystem. The higher impact of ammonium than nitrate was detected in 352 
all plant functional types except for grasses. The ammonium addition mainly stimulated below - 353 
ground growth but nitrate  addition only significantly en hanced above -ground growth. These 354 
findings indicate that the different preference for N forms in terrestrial plants complicat es the 355 
predictions of future changes ecosystem structure and functions under the N enrichment . There 356 
is a large spatial variation  of the  trend of  NH x/NO y at the globe , so plants that grow in the real 357 
ecosystems could respond to future N enrichment differently from that have been reported  by 358 
the manipulative field  experiments. Thus, we recommend future manipulative experiments with 359 
N addition to consider the compositional features of local N deposition and the different 360 
preference s of plant species for acquiring ammonium and nitrate .        361
