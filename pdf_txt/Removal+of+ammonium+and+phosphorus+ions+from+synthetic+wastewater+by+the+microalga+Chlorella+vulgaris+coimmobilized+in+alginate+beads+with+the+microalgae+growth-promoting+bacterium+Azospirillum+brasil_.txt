1. Introduction
The fresh water unicellular microalga Chlorella
vulgarisisusedfortertiarywastewatertreatmentmainly
fortheremovalofnitrogenandphosphoruscompounds
and heavy metals [1–4]. It is also used for several
industrial processes unrelated to wastewater treatment[5,6].
The interactions between the microalgae and other
microorganismsinitsecologicalnicheorduringwaste-watertreatmenthavenotbeenwellstudied. Pseudomo-
nas diminuta and P. vesicularis , two obligate aerobes
isolated from laboratory algal cultures, stimulated thegrowth of the microalgae Scenedesmus bicellularis and
Chlorellasp., without releasing any growth-promoting
substance[7].Recently,wehaveshownthatcoimmobi-lizationof C. vulgariswiththeplantgrowth-promoting
bacterium (PGPB, [8]) Azospirillum brasilense , used as
aninoculantinagriculture[9],signiﬁcantlyincreasedthegrowth and pigment production of the microalgae[10,11],analogoustotheeffectofthebacteriumonthe
growth of numerous terrestrial plants [12]. However,
coimmobilization of the microalgae with its associativebacteriumfromthewastewatertreatmentpond, Phyllo-
bacterium myrsinacearum , changed the metabolism of
the microalga, but did not enhance its growth; themicroalgae senesced and died earlier when associated
with P. myrsinacearum than when associated with A.
brasilense[11,13].
The aim of this study was to determine whether the
growth-promotingassociationofthePGPB A. brasilense
with C. vulgaris will also improve ammonium and
phosphorusionremovalbythemicroalgaefrombatch,continuous and semi-continuous synthetic wastewater
cultures. This has been done as a ﬁrst step toward

were conﬁned by coimmobilization in small alginatebeads, a practical means of using microorganisms for
environmentalapplications[15,16,17].
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Microorganisms and axenic growth conditions
C. vulgaris (UTEX 2714) was isolated from a
secondary efﬂuent of a wastewater-treatment stabiliza-tionpondnearSantaf !edeBogot !a,Colombia[3].Before
immobilization in alginate beads, C. vulgaris was
cultivatedinsterilemineralmedium(C30)aspreviouslydescribed [3] for 5 days. A. brasilense was grown in
liquid Nutrient Broth (Difco, Detroit, MI) at 30 721C
for 48h in a rotary shaker. Both organisms wereharvested and prepared for coimmobilization as pre-viouslydescribed[18,10].
2.2. Artiﬁcial wastewater
Artiﬁcial, sterile (by autoclaving) wastewater was
prepared using the following (mg/L) [10]: NaCl, 7;CaCl
2, 4; MgSO 4/C17H2O, 2; K2HPO4, 21.7; KH 2PO4,
8.5;Na2HPO4,33.4;andNH 4Cl,3(insomeexperiments
3.2–3.4mg/L were used as speciﬁcally indicated). Forcontinuous and semi-continuous cultures, KH
2PO4,a t
levels in the range of 12–15mg/L, was used as the sole
phosphorussource.
2.3. Coimmobilization of microalgae and bacteria in
alginate beads, bead solubilization, and count of
microorganisms within beads
Allwerepreparedaspreviouslydescribed[19,10].
2.4. Continuous, semi-continuous and batch cultures
A chemostat (Virtis, Gardiner, NY) was used for all
continuous and semi-continuous culture experiments.
Each run of the chemostat was composed of 20g of
microbe-containing alginate beads and 500mL ofsolution.Continuouscultureswererunfor6daysunderthe following conditions: 28 721C, 90rpm with 100%
dissolvedoxygen,alightintensityof30 mmole/m
2/s,and
a medium exchange rate of 1.5mL/h. Semi-continuouscultures were run under the same conditions, but the
beads were incubated for 48h in wastewater medium
without replacement of the solution (one cycle). Then,the solution was decanted for analysis and new sterile
wastewater solution was added for further incubation.
This procedure was repeated for 6 consecutive runs.BatchculturesinErlenmeyerﬂasks(500mLofmedium
with 20g of beads) were incubated as previously
described[10].
2.5. Ammonium and phosphorus ions analyses
Ammonium and phosphorus ion content was mea-
suredusingstandardwateranalysistechniques[20]anda Hach DR/2000 spectrophotometer (Hach Co., Love-
land, CO, USA). Ammonium was analyzed by the
salicylate method, nitrate by the cadmium reductionmethod, and phosphorus (orthophosphate) by the
molibdovanadate method. Kits developed by the Hach
Company were used for the speciﬁc detection ofammoniumandphosphorusions.
2.6. Experimental design and statistical analysis
Asinglerunofthechemostat(whetherincontinuous
or semi-continuous mode) was considered a singlereplicate, and each experiment was performed intriplicate. For batch cultures, ﬁve replicates were
analyzed where each Erlenmeyer ﬂask served as one
replicate. Each experiment was repeated at least twice,but usually each experiment was repeated, identically,
three times. Controls were prepared similarly but
without microorganisms in the beads. Controls havingmicroalga alone immobilized in beads were routinely
used. Three 50mL samples were taken for each water
analysisateachsamplingtime.Resultsofallrepetitionswere combined and analyzed together by one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) at Pp0:05 or by
Student’s t-test at Pp0:05 using Statistica software
(Statsoft,Tulsa,OK).LineﬁtwasdonebyCurveExpert1.2software(Hyams,Central,SC).
3. Results
3.1. Growth of C. vulgaris coimmobilized with
A. brasilense within alginate beads
Cultures of C. vulgaris coimmobilized with A.
brasilensein alginate beads greww ell, but to
different extents, under batch, continuous and semi-
continuous conditions (Fig.1). The best growth wasobtained under batch culture conditions, during whichthepopulationreached4 /C210
6cells/beadafter6daysof
incubation. Under semi-continuous conditions, the
growth of the population was somewhat less, reaching3/C210
6cells/bead.Undercontinuouscultureconditions,
growthwasthelowest,reachingapopulationdensityof
only 1.3 /C2106cells/bead. In comparison, when C.
vulgariswas immobilized alone in continuous culture,
a population density of o1.0/C2106cells/bead was
achieved[10].L.E. de-Bashan et al. / Water Research 36 (2002) 2941–2948 29423.2. Removal of ammonium and phosphorus by
C. vulgaris coimmobilized with A. brasilense or
immobilized alone under batch culture conditions
Under batch culture conditions, inoculation with
coimmobilized microorganisms resulted in the removal
of more ammonium and phosphorus from thewastewater than inoculation with immobilized
microalgae alone. After 2 days of incubation, 93%
of the ammonium was eliminated (Fig.2A), (from3 to 0.2mg/L NH
4+) in the coimmobilized
culture compared to only 53% in the immobilized
culture (from 3 to 1.4mg/L NH 4+). After 6 days of
incubation, 99% of the ammonium was eliminated
(Fig.2A),(from3to0.1mg/LNH 4+)inthecoimmobi-
lized culture and only 86% was eliminated in thecultures containing microalgae alone (from 3 to0.4mg/LNH
4+).
No phosphorus was removed when the concentra-
tion of PO 4/C03in the water exceeded 20mg/L;
therefore, this study employed PO 4/C03concentrations of
15mg/Lorless.Seventyﬁvepercentofthephosphorus
waseliminatedafter48hof incubationinthe coimmo-bilized culture (from 12 to 3mg/L PO
4/C03); no further
removal was observed after this time. C. vulgaris
immobilized alone did not remove phosphorus fromthe wastewater. On the contrary, there was a smallaccumulation of phosphorus during the incubation
period(Fig.2B).3.3. Removal of ammonium and phosphorus by
C. vulgaris coimmobilized with A. brasilense
or immobilized alone in continuous culture
After48hofincubation,91%oftheammoniumwas
removedfromthewastewaterinoculatedwithcoimmo-
bilizedcultures(from3.2to0.3mg/LNH
4+)(Fig.3A)but
only 59% of the ammonium was removed from theculturecontainingmicroalgaealone(from3.2to1.3mg/L
NH
4+). Prolonged incubation (more than 48h) did not
resultinadditionalremovalofammoniumions;rather,asmallaccumulationofammoniumionswasnotedinboth
cultures. There was no depletion of phosphorus from
eithercultureduring72hofincubationusedinthissectionof the study. The level of phosphorus ﬂuctuated but did
notdropbelowtheinitialphosphoruslevel(Fig.3B).
3.4. Removal of ammonium and phosphorus by
C. vulgaris coimmobilized with A. brasilense
or immobilized alone in semi-continuous culture
As a result of the previous experiments that showed
optimalremovalofionsfromthewastewaterafter48h
of incubation with beads containing microorganisms,thesemi-continuoussystemwasdesignedwithcyclesof
48h each. In the microalgae-bacteria coimmobilized
cultures, after the ﬁrst 48h incubation (cycle no. 1),100% of the ammonium was removed. This removal
ratewasmaintainedforthreemorecyclesof48heach.
Then, the efﬁciency of the system decreased, with lessammoniumremovedduringeachsubsequentcycle,and
ﬁnally, at the end of the sixth cycle (286h total
incubation time), only 67% of the ammonium wasremoved(from3.4to0.9mg/LNH
4+).Culturescontain-
ingthemicroalgaeimmobilizedalonewerelessefﬁcient,
removing only 85% of the ammonium during the ﬁrst
cycle. In each of the following cycles, even lessammonium was removed Fup to 35% of the ammo-
niumaddedatthebeginningofeachcycle(from3.4to
2.2mg/LNH
4+)(Fig.4A).
Only in the ﬁrst cycle (48h) was there signiﬁcant
phosphorus removal (83%) by the coimmobilized
cultures (from 15 to 2.5mg/L PO 4/C03) (Fig.4B). In the
secondcycle,therewasanaccumulationofphosphorusfor some unknown reason. In later cycles, the system
hadalimitedremovalcapacity:33%inthefourthcycle
but usually o14% in other cycles. Cultures of micro-
algae immobilized alone showed lower phosphorus
removal:33%inthefourthcyclebutusually o20%in
othercycles(from15to12mg/LPO
4/C03)(Fig.4B).

evaluated today [3,22]. The underlying assumption is
that the microalgae will transform some of the
contaminants to non-hazardous materials and thetreated water can then be reused or safely discharged
[23]. C. vulgaris, immobilized in a polymer matrix, has
beenproposedforwastewatertreatment[24–30,17].Theuse of a combination of microalgae with microalgae
growth-promoting bacteria has not previously been
documented.
Bacteriaexclusivelyassociatedwithunicellularaqua-
tic plants are not well studied [7,13,11]. However, the
plant growth-promoting bacterium A. brasilense , nor-mallyassociatedwithterrestrialplants,hadasigniﬁcant
positive effect on the growth of the microalgae when
coimmobilized in alginate beads [10]. Therefore, this
bacterium can be labeled as a ‘‘microalgaegrowth-promoting bacterium’’ (MGPB). The aim of
thisstudywastodeterminewhethergrowthpromotion
correlateswithimprovedwaterbiotreatmentcapacityofthe microalga, speciﬁcally, an improved ability to
remove ammonium and phosphorus ions from the
wastewater. These ions are major contaminants ofagroindustrial wastewater, and are present in largequantities from the dairy industry and from cattle and
pigfarming[3,14].

pond [31,29,30]; (ii) continuous cultures, where a
continuous ﬂow of the wastewater is passed through acompartment (fermentor, chemostat, bioreactor, or as
part of a constructed wetland) containing the micro-
algae.Theoretically,thiswilltreatanunlimitedvolumeof wastewater [31,32,27,28]; however, in practice, we
found(inthisstudy)thatthesystembecomessaturated
after a while depending on the level of contaminationand the inherent capacity of the microalgae species toadsorb or transform the contaminants; (iii) semi-
continuous cultures, where a volume of wastewater istreated under batch culture conditions for a limited
period of time, then the wastewater is replaced but thesame microbial cultureisusedto treatthe newvolumeof wastewater. This can be repeated until the system is
saturated;and(iv)re-circulationofwastewaterthrough

disappearanceofspeciﬁccompounds.
This study shows that, in addition to increasing
microalgalgrowth[10],coimmobilizationofMGPBand
microalga (where both microorganisms are conﬁned tocavitiesoflimitedspaceinsidealginatebeads,microbial
numbers are high, and there is no interference from
other microorganisms), can also improve wastewatertreatment.Thebioremovalofnitrogenandphosphoruswas signiﬁcantly improved when both microorganisms
were present compared to removal by the microalgaealone(e.g., for NH
4+,removal afterthe fourthcycle of
100% vs. 35%, and for PO 4/C03, removal after the ﬁrst
cycleof83%vs. o20%).Thus,thiscombinationcanbe
useful as a potential tool to develop novel wastewater
treatments.
Semi-continuous coimmobilized cultures were super-
iorinremovingthenutrientsfromwastewatercompared
to continuous or batch cultures. A high level ofammonium removal could be maintained by thesecultures for six consecutive cycles; in the initial four
cycles all ammonium was removed. The microalgae

even further to 35%. After these cycles, both systemsbecame saturated and removal of ammonium ions
stopped. Phosphorus ions were also removed from the
wastewater but to a lesser extent. At high phosphoruslevels in the wastewater or under continuous cultureconditions,withorwithoutaccompanyingMGPBinthe
bead, no phosphorus removal by the microalgae was
detected. In batch and semi-continuous cultures, theMGPB–microalga combination was more efﬁcient at
removing phosphorus than the microalgae alone but
removal was substantial only after the ﬁrst 48h periodof incubation (the ﬁrst of six wastewater replacements
treatedbythemicroorganisms),reaching83%removal.
In subsequent cycles, the removal rate was reduced.After 96h of incubation, there was usually an un-
explained increase in the phosphorus content of the
wastewater, which declined in latercycles. Noneof thelatercycleshadthecapacityoftheﬁrstcycleinremovingphosphorus.
It is worth mentioning that, while the removal of
PO
4/C03was signiﬁcant, the amount remaining in all the
