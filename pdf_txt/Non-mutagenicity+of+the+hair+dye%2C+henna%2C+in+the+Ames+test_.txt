1. BACKGROUND  
 
Submission I for Henna was submitted in October 1999.  The Scientific Committee on Cosmetic Pr oducts and Non-Food Products intended for 
Consumers (SCCNFP) adopted at its 21
st plenary meeting of 17 September 2002, an opinion 
(SCCNFP/0505/01, final) which stated that:  “Submission I on Lawsonia inermis was inadequate. Before any further consideration, a full and 
adequate dossier would be required, including sp ecifications of the substance tested and 
marketed, and adequate in vivo genotoxicity data on natural henna c ontaining the maximum 
amount of 2-Hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (Lawsone)”.  
 
Submission II provided data  on the specification of Lawsonia inermis , but it did not include the 
data requested on in vivo  genotoxicity.  
 Submission III was submitted in July 2005 and pr ovided data on the conditions of use of 
Lawsonia inermis. Submission III presents updated scientific data on the above mentioned 
substance in line with the second step of the strategy for the evaluation of hair dyes (
http://europa.eu.int/comm/enterprise/cosm etics/doc/hairdyestrategyinternet.pdf ) within the framework 
of the Cosmetics Directive 76/768/EEC.  Lawsone, a natural component in the hair dye preparations of Lawsonia inermis , has been 
examined by SCCNFP which in its latest opinion on Lawsone (SCCNFP/0798/04), adopted on 16 February 2004, stated that ‘  Lawsone has genotoxicity/mutagenicity potential in vitro and in 
vivo and that therefore no safe threshold for Lawsone can be established .’ 
  
2. TERMS OF REFERENCE  
 
1. Does the Scientific Committee on Consumer Products (SCCP) consider Lawsonia inermis 
safe for use as a hair dye taken into account the scientific data provided? 
 2. Does the SCCP recommend any restrictions w ith regard to the use of Lawsonia inermis in 
any hair dye formulations? SCCP/0943/05

3.2. Function and uses 
 
Lawsonia inermis  (Henna) is used as a hair dye based on the staining properties of one of its 
constituents, e.g. Lawsone. Modified Henna products, such as Black Henna are also available to consumers. The content of 
Lawsone among various modified Henna products  may vary significantly, but these products 
contain some other substances for modifying the intensity of the colour provided by Henna alone.  According to the information provided, a represen tative hair dye formulation will be prepared by 
mixing 100 g Lawsonia inermis  as dried plant powder with 300 ml of boiling water. After 
cooling the mixture (mush) the pulp will be a pplied on the hair for a period of 15 min to 2h. 
Thereafter, the mush is rinsed off with water a nd the hair will be washed with a mild shampoo to 
eliminate any residues. 
Ref.: 17 (subm. II) 
 Although Lawsonia inermis (Henna)  is not listed in Annex IV of Directive 76/768/EEC on 
cosmetic products, aqueous pastes of Henna are used for skin decoration.  SCCP/0943/05

 8at 1, 24, 48, 72 hours and 7 days. The untreated eye se rved as control. The findings were scored 
according to a modified scoring system comparable to the scheme of Draize.  Results No findings of the cornea occurred. Transient infl ammation of the iris and moderate conjunctival 
irritation were observed up to a maximum of  48 and 72 hours, respectively. When scored, 
according to the modified scoring systems, th e mean values are 17.0; 15.7; 10.0; 2.7 and 0.0 after 
1, 24, 48 and 72 hours and 7 days, respectively. Th e iris and conjunctival findings subsided 
completely after 7 days.  Conclusion Lawsonia inermis was slightly and transiently irritating to the eyes of 3 New Zealand White 
rabbits.

Buehler Test 
 
Guideline: OECD 406(1981), Commission Directive 84/449/EEC Species/strain: Guinea pig/Dunkin Hartley Group size: Main study: 10 female animals in th e control, 20 female animals in the test 
groups 
Test substance: Henna rot Batch: 830.72 Route: Occlusive epicutaneous induction (50%) and challenge (50%) Carrier: Petrolatum jelly B.P. GLP: Yes  The sensitizing property of the test substance was evaluated in a Buehler delayed contact 
hypersensitivity study using female albino Ha rtley guinea pigs. One group of 20 animals 
received induction exposures of 0.5 ml at a concentr ation of 50% in petrolatum jelly B.P. on the 
left flank on absorbent lint (approximately 15 mm x 35 mm) after removal of hair. The occlusive 
dressing was kept in place for 6 hours and the induction was repeated on the same site on days 7 
and 14 for a total of three 6 h exposures. The sk in was carefully examined approximately 24 h 
after each induction on days 1, 8 and 15. Challenge was performed on day 28 by application of  0.5 ml test material (50% in petrolatum 
jelly B.P.) on an area of about 15 mm x 30 mm on the right left flank clipped free of hair held 
under occlusion for 6 h. Approximately 24 and 48 h after removal of the occlusive dressing, the 
skin reaction was evaluated and scored using a f our-point scale. The individual reactions to the 
tests substance preparation at the challenge s ites were compared between control and test 
animals.  Results Staining caused by the test substance preparati on was observed after removal of the occlusive 
dressing.  The study authors considered that this di d not prevent evaluation of the treated skin in 
respect to erythema formation. No treatment-relate d reaction was noted on the treated skin in any 
animals (0/20).   SCCP/0943/05

 9Conclusion 
The results suggest that Lawsonia inermis  exhibited no potential to induce dermal sensitization 
in Guinea pigs in the Buehler test under the c onditions used. However, skin staining may have 
compromised evaluation.

Human data 
 
Repeated insult path test (RIPT) 
 
Guideline: / Species: Human Group size: 10 volunteers Test substance: Henna rot Batch: 830.72 Route: Epicutaneous application (no further information supplied) GLP: /  A repeated insult patch test (RIP T) according to a modified protocol was performed with the test 
substance on a panel of 10 volunteers. The tested concentration was 10% in petrolatum and the 
induction phase lasted for 3 weeks followed by a challenge after one week of no treatment.  Results No skin findings were observed on the tested sk in area of any of the volunteers at any time 
during the 3 weeks of induction phase and at challenge after a one week rest period.  Conclusion There was no indication for any irritative or sensitizing potential under the conditions of the 
study in Human volunteers.  Comment The study would currently no longer be considered ethical by the SCCP.

Experience under specific conditions in humans 
 
It is known from the literature that Lawsonia inermis  is widely used both as  a hair dye in and for 
skin paintings. Under such conditions of use, reports of contact allergies are rare. Two case 
reports from India describe allergic contact dermatitis from Lawsonia inermis . 
Ref.: 19, 20 (subm. II)  
  A beautician with known allergy to house dust experienced rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma and a generalized urticaria after exposure to Lawsonia inermis . The symptoms increased in severity 
with continued exposure. Scratch tests with Lawsonia inermis  powder were strongly positive. By 
thin-layer chromatography the red colour a nd 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone we re isolated from 
the extract. These materials gave negative scratch tests. The result showed that the allergen was 
neither the quinone nor the red colour but an unde termined agent. In a further case report, a SCCP/0943/05

3.3.4.  Dermal / percutaneous absorption 
 
Introductory remarks 
Lawsonia inermis powder as a product of botanical origin is composed of various ingredients 
and cannot be examined per se  for percutaneous absorption. Consequently, it is necessary to 
identify and select a representative lead ingredie nt. Since Lawsone is an important ingredient 
and can be analyzed easily, it has been selected as the lead ingredient. However, Lawsone is 
predominantly glycosidic bound and only a small am ount is available in the plant powder. For 
practical and analytical reasons, Lawsone is ther efore often added separately and mixed to the 
Lawsonia inermis powder, especially when the investigati ons were performed with radiolabelled 
material.    
Percutaneous Absorption in vitro 
 
Guidelines: / Test system: Isolated pig skin Method: Permeation chambers (flow through system) Test substance:  Lawsonia inermis powder (Henna containing 1% Lawsone (2-hydroxy- 
1,4-naphthoquinone)) 
Batch: No data Dose level: 25% Lawsonia inermis powder as aqueous preparation 
Exposure period: 30 minutes GLP: No  The pig skin pieces were fixed into the permea tion cells and 0.1 g/cm² of  an aqueous pulp of 
25% Lawsonia inermis powder (containing 1% of Lawsone) was exposed for 30 minutes. Then 
the residues were removed by a spatula and the skin was washed using water and detergent. 
Percutaneous penetration was determined af ter an incubation time of 72 hours. Following 
extraction, the amounts of Lawsone were analyzed by HPLC.  Results When Lawsonia inermis  powder was investigated under use conditions as a 25% aqueous pulp, it 
was shown that Lawsone penetrated through the pig skin in vitro . After exposure of 30 min and a 
follow-up period of 72 h, about 0.28% of the applie d dose of Lawsone was found in the receptor 
fluid and 0.06% remained in the skin. Therefore, the respective absolute skin penetration rate 
was 703 ng/cm². The amount that remained in th e skin was demonstrated as 160 ng/cm² but no 
differentiation was possible for the fraction th at was adsorbed on the stratum corneum or 
absorbed by the deeper skin layers.

 11An abstract was recently published on studies  to mimic consumer use conditions of Lawsonia 
inermis containing products by investigating skin absorption of Lawsone from two hair 
colouring products and two shampoo products. [14C ]-Lawsone was added separately to each 
commercial product and applied to excised, non-vi able human skin (thickness of approx. 200 – 
320 µm) mounted in flow-through diffusion cells perfused with a physiological buffer. The 
products remained on the skin for 5 min (shampoos) and 1 h (hair colour pastes). The examination of the henna hair paste products s howed that 0.29 and 1.4% of the applied dose was 
absorbed into the receptor fluid in 24 h and 2.2% and 3.7% remained in the skin. For the henna shampoo products, 0.32 and 0.34% of the applied dose was absorbed into the receptor fluid at 24 
h and 3.6% and 6.8% remained in the skin. For all products, most of the lawsone applied was 
washed from the surface of the skin (83 - 102%) at the end of the exposure period. Extended absorption studies for 72 h demonstrated that the majority of lawsone remained in the skin and 
the receptor fluid values did not increase signi ficantly. Following administration of henna paste 
for example, the 72 h receptor fluid values  were only 0.48 and 1.61% opposed to 0.29 and 1.4% 
after 24 h.  As only the abstract is presently available, th e validity and reliability of these investigations 
cannot be assessed; important information on materials and methods, including analysis, are 
missing and the results are only provided as percen tages and not as absolute values, which is a 
prerequisite for valid risk assessment.

determined in blood samples taken from the retrobulbar venous plexus (first sampling 45 min. p.a.).  Results The majority of the applied radioactivity was removed from the skin by rinsing 40 min after 
application of the aqueous Lawsonia inermis pulp spiked with [14C]-Lawsone and a mean of 
93.9% was detected. The mean percutaneous abso rption of the test substance amounted to 0.20 
% of the administered radioactivity after 72 hours. The application site contained a mean radioactivity level of 3.1% of the applied dose.  The blood level of [14C] was highest at 45 min 
after application and declined with an initial ha lf-life of approximately 2 h. The [14C]-labelled 
substance was excreted mainly via urine (86 % of  the eliminated radioactivity) and to a lesser 
extent via faeces (14% of the e liminated radioactivity). Within the first 24 h, the mean excretion 
was fast, 91% of the eliminated [14C] substance.  The mean radioactivity levels of blood and the 
14 analyzed organs were all near or below the detection limit at 72 h after application. Relatively 
high concentrations were found in thyroids, kidne ys and ovaries; lowest in muscle, heart and 
femur.  Conclusion The cutaneous application of the aqueous Lawsonia inermis pulp spiked with [14C]-Lawsone to 
mimic human use conditions onto the skin of male and female rats rat skin led to a percutaneous absorption of 0.2% determined as radioactivity  after 72 hours, corresponding to an absolute 
absorption of 1.70 µg /cm².  Comment The exposure time in the study (40 minutes) did not comply with the exposure time used by consumers (15 minutes to 2 hours).

A 13-week oral toxicity study wa s conducted in Sprague-Dawley rats (4 groups of 10 rats per 
sex) with a 0.5 % aqueous methylcellulose solu tion of Henna Rot administered once daily by 
gavage according to the OECD Guideline N°  408. The treated animals received the test 
substance corresponding to daily dosage of 40, 200 and 1000 mg/kg body weight. Control animals received the vehicle alone under the same conditions. In addition, 10 males and 10 
females were included in the control and high dose group for a 4-week recovery period.  No mortality was observed during the study. In  the high dose group, 2/40 animals occasionally 
presented signs of poor clinical condition (loud breathing, piloerection) and 6/20 males presented 
ptyalism from week 9 or 11 onwards . Brown urine and/or tail were noted in almost all animals. 
All clinical signs were reversible after 4-week s recovery period, except for brown-coloured tail. SCCP/0943/05

In the high dose group, the hair and body extremities as well as the fore-stomach and the mucosa of the bladder were coloured orange related to th e staining properties of the test substance. Mean 
food consumption and body weight gain of the treated  males were in the range of controls; mean 
body weight gain of the females given 40 or 1000 mg/kg/day was slightly lower than that of 
control but this finding was not dose-dependent and was not considered by investigators to be 
treatment-related. Neither treatment-related ophthalmological abnormalities nor effects in clinical chemistry (blood biochemistry, urinalysis) were noted in any treated group. Concerning haematological parameters, slightly lower erythrocyte count and haemoglobin were 
noted in the high dose group when compared to the control values, these differences were considered of no toxicological importance by the investigators. In the highest dose group, 
statistically significant higher mean kidney and spleen weights were noted. All these findings were reversible after 4-weeks recovery period except for the kidney weight of 
the females, but it was considered to be of no toxicological importance by the investigators as no 
relevant microscopic findings were noted.  Concerning microscopic examinations, no findings of  toxicological relevance were noted at the 
low dose level. In the 200 mg/kg/day group, minimal to slight hemosiderosis was noted in the spleen. In the high dose group, minimal to mode rate accumulation of acidophilic globules in the 
cortical tubular epithelium of the kidneys were recorded and were considered to be treatment-
related. In the 200 mg/kg/day and in the 1000 mg/kg/day groups, minimal to slight 
hemosiderosis and some extramedullary hemopoies is were noted in the spleen. Except for the 
hemosiderosis in the spleen and the dyeing e ffects in the high dose group, all findings were 
reversible during the recovery period.  Based on these results, the NOAEL (No-Observed -Adverse-Effect-Level) of Henna Rot was 
established to be 40 mg/kg bw.

 14The test substance was tested for mutagenicity  in the reverse mutation assay on bacteria both, 
with and without metabolic activation (S9 mix from the liver of Phenobarbital and ß-
Naphthoflavone induced male Wistar rats) accord ing to the plate incorporation method. The 
Salmonella typhimurium strains TA 98, TA 100, TA 1535, TA  1537 and TA1538 were exposed 
to the test substance (dissolved in DMSO) at concentrations ranging from 50 µg/plate to 5000 
µg/plate (with and without S9 mix). All concentrations were filtered through a 0.45 µm filter. 
Appropriate negative and positive controls were included.  Results No bacteriotoxic effect was observed. Henna Rot di d not induce revertants in the bacterial strains 
in the tested concentration range between 50 to 5000 µg/plate. The sensitivity and validity of the 
test system used was demonstrated by the si gnificant induction of revertants by the positive 
controls.  Conclusion In conclusion, it can be stated that under the e xperimental conditions reported, the test item did 
not induce gene mutations by base pair changes or  frame shifts in the genome of the bacterial 
strains used in the presence and absence of S9-mix. Thus, Henna rot (batch 830.72) was shown to be non-mutagenic in this Salmonella typhimurium test.

No bacteriotoxic effect was observed but the te st material showed bacterial contamination. 
Therefore, an evaluation of the high concentra tions was limited in the normally used tester 
strains. The application of streptomycin-resistant te ster strains proved to be a useful way to test 
contaminated materials. These tester strains showed a comparable sensitivity and spontaneous reversion rate compared to the normally used stra ins. The advantage of the use of streptomycin-
resistant strains is that the test material  needs no sterilization. Henna Rot did not induce 
revertants in the bacterial strains in the tested concentration range between 50 to 5000 µg/plate. 
The sensitivity and validity of the test system used was demonstrated by the significant induction 
of revertants by the positive controls.  Conclusion Under the experimental conditions selected, He nna rot (batch 830.72) did not show a mutagenic 
potential in the presence and absence of S9-mix this Salmonella typhimurium gene mutation test. 
(Reference: 6)  The results of these two bacterial gene mutation assays are in line with data published in the 
literature. Stamberg et al. (1979) tested Lawsonia inermis (red henna) in bacterial gene mutation 
test (Ames test) and did not find a significant i nduction of mutations for concentrations up to 
1000 µg/plate

HPRT gene mutation test with V79 cells. In a pr eliminary cytotoxicity assay, the test substance 
was applied at concentrations between 100 - 1000 mg/ml with and without metabolic activation 
(rat liver S9-mix induced with Aroclor 1254). Thereafter, two independent main assays were  conducted using concentration ranges of 1 – 200 
mg/ml without S9 mix and 10 – 1000 mg/ml or  10 – 3000 mg/ml with S9 mix. S9 mix was 
obtained from the liver of rats induced with  Aroclor 1254. Test substance was suspended in 
water, which was also used as solvent control, whereas the positive control substances Ethyl Methanesulfonate (1 µl/ml, without S9 mix) and 7,12- Dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (10 µg/ml, 
with S9 mix) were diluted in the cell culture medium.   Results SCCP/0943/05

 16Cytotoxicity was observed in the main test at a dose of 200 µg/ml without S9-mix and at of 2000 
µg/ml with S9-mix. The test substance caused no increase in the number of mutant colonies 
when tested without S9-mix. With S9-mix, the fi rst test showed no increase in the number of 
mutant colonies. However, in the duplicate te st a non-dose-dependent increase to a maximum 
factor of 3.3 was observed at the lowest dose onl y, while higher dose levels showed value in the 
range of negative controls. Moreover, the observed increase did not reach the threshold defined for a positive test. The sensitivity and validity of the test system used was demonstrated by the significant induction mutants by the positive controls.  Conclusion In conclusion, Henna Rot (batch 830.72) is not muta genic in the HPRT gene mutation test with 
V79 cells under the test conditions used.

TK
+/- gene mutation assay (mouse lymphoma assay) 
 
Guidelines: OECD 476 (1998) Test system: Mouse lymphoma cell line L5178Y Replicates: Two independent experiments Test Substance: Henna ( Lawsonia inermis , COLIPA n° C169) 
Batch: 1271 (content of 2-Hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone 1.36%). Concentrations: Experiment I: 75 – 900 µg/ml with metabolic activation 
 150 – 1200 µg/ml without metabolic activation 
 Experiment II: 78.1 - 1250 µg/ml without metabolic activation 
Solvent: Deionized water GLP: Yes  The test substance was tested for the possible induction of mutations at the thymidine kinase 
locus using the cell line L5178Y. The assay was performed in two independent experiments, 
using two parallel cultures each. The first main e xperiment was performed with and without S9-
mix and a treatment period of 4 h. S9 mix was obt ained from the liver of male Wistar rats 
induced with Phenobarbital/ß-Naphthoflavone. The second experiment was performed in the absence of metabolic activation with a treatment period of 24 hours. Prior to the mutation assays 
a pretest for cytotoxicity was performed to determine the concentration ranges in the mutagenicity test. The highest concentration used in the pre-test (5000 µg/ml) was chosen according to the 
guidelines. Test item concentrations between 39.1 and 5000 µg/ml were used to evaluate toxicity 
in the presence (4 h treatment) and absence (4 h and 24 h treatment) of metabolic activation. The 
test medium was checked for precipitation at th e end of each treatment period (4 or 24 hours) 
before the test item was removed. The stability of  the test substance in the solvent (deionized 
water) was analyzed in respect to Lawsone for a period of at least 4 hours. Appropriate negative and positive controls were included.  Results Precipitation of the test item was observed at all c oncentrations of the test item. Relevant toxic 
effects, indicated by a relative total growth or  a relative cloning efficiency below 50 % occurred 
in the first experiment at 600 µg/ml and a bove without- and at 900 µg/ml and above with 
metabolic activation. SCCP/0943/05

 17No biologically relevant and reproducible increase of the mutation frequency was observed in 
any of the experiments. An isolated positive re sponse was seen after 4 hours treatment in the 
absence of S9-mix 1200 µg/ml. However, relative total grow th was less than 3% under these 
conditions. The positive controls showed a distinct increase in induced total mutant colonies.  Conclusion Under the experimental conditions used the test  substance did not induce mutations in the TK
+/- 
gene mutation assay with the mouse lymphoma ce ll line L5178Y in the absence and presence of 
metabolic activation. Thus, Henna ( Lawsonia inermis , COLIPA n° C169, batch 1271 containing 
1.36% 2-Hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone) was shown to be non-mutagenic in this mouse lymphoma assay.

Solvent: Culture medium (Eagle’s Minimal Essential Medium (MEM)) GLP: Yes  Henna Rot assessed for its potential to induce structural chromosome aberrations in Human lymphocytes in vitro . The test substance was tested in the presence and absence of metabolic 
activation (S9 mix prepared from Aroclor 1254 induced male Sprague-Dawley rat liver). The test article was dissolved in culture medium (MEM). Duplicate cultures of cells were exposed to the 
test substance for 4 hours in the presence of me tabolic activation with cell harvest after 16 and 
26 hours expression as well as for 20 hours in an e xperiment without S9-mix. The concentrations 
ranged between 78.13 – 625 µg/ml without metabolic activation and 156.25 – 1250 µg/ml with

 18Precipitation was observed on the microscopic slides  prepared from most of the cultures treated 
with the test substance. Mitosis was almost completely inhibited at dose levels >625 µg/ml in the 
absence of S9-mix, while in the presence of metabolic activation mitosis was severely reduced at 2500 and 5000 µg/ml. According to the laboratory evaluation criteria 625 µg/ml was selected as 
the highest concentration for evaluati on without metabolic activation and 1250 µg/ml for 
assessment with S9-mix. Henna Rot induced a dose-related decrease in the mitotic index with and without S9-mix at the 
20 h harvest, while at the 30 h with S9-mix, mito sis was inhibited at all three dose-levels but 
without a clear concentration-effect-relationship. There was an increase in the frequency of ce lls with structural chromosome aberrations 
(excluding gaps) in both of treatment groups w ith S9-mix at the highest dose level. No 
clastogenic potential was observed at any concentration when tested without metabolic activation. No increase in the numbers of polypl oid cells was noted at any dose level in any 
assay. Positive controls led to increased frequencies of cells with structural aberrations.  Conclusion Under the conditions of the assay described, He nna rot (batch 830.72) induced an increase in 
structural chromosome aberrations in cultured human lymphocytes in the presence of S9-mix. 
Thus, Henna Rot is considered as weakly clastogenic.

 200 – 800 µg/ml with metabolic activation (3 h exposure) 
Solvent: DMSO GLP: Yes  Henna Rot was examined for genotoxic effects in th e in vitro SCE test with CHO cells. The test 
was performed with and without metabolic activ ation (S9 mix from the liver of Aroclor 1254 
induced rats). The test substance was disso lved in DMSO. Prior to the main study the 
cytotoxicity was evaluated in concentrations ranging from 50 – 1000 µg/ml. Based on the 
observed toxicity, concentrations in the range of 25 – 200 µg/ml without metabolic activation for 
the 3 and 24 h exposure periods and between 200 – 800 µg/ml with metabolic activation after 3 h 
of exposure were selected. After treatment cells were cultured in the presence of 5´-
bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) for further 24 hours. Ther eafter, colcemid was added for a period of 
2 – 3 h before end of incubation time and cells ha rvest. The solvent DMSO was used as negative 
control, while ethylmethane sulphonate (100 and 200 µg/ml) was used as a positive control 
without metabolic activation and cyclophosphamide (1 and 2 µg/ml) with metabolic activation.

In vivo Mouse Bone Marrow Micronucleus Test 
 
Guidelines: OECD 474 (1981) Species/strain: Mouse/CD-1 Group size: 5 male and 5 females per group Test Substance: Henna rot  Batch: 830.72 Dose level: 300 mg/kg bw Solvent: 1% aqueous carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) Route: i.p. Exposure period: once GLP: Yes  The ability of Henna Rot to cause chromosomal damage in vivo was investigated in the mouse 
bone marrow micronucleus test. The choice of dos e level was based on an initial range-finding 
study in which Henna Rot, formulated in 1% a queous CMC was administered via intraperitoneal 
injection (i.p.). The test substance was administer ed to groups of 2 male and 2 female CD-1 mice 
once in doses ranged between 300 – 5000 mg/kg bw (i.p.) or 5000 mg/kg bw (oral). Doses at and 
above 500 mg/kg bw were lethal and evoked severe clinical findings.  Therefore, a single dose level of 300 mg/kg bw wa s selected and 5 male and 5 female mice were 
chosen for the main study. A vehicle control (1% aqueous CMC) and a positive control (Cyclophosphamide, 50 mg/kg bw, 
i.p.) were also tested. Following dosing the anim als were examined regularly and any mortality 
or clinical signs of reaction to the test compound were recorded. The mice were killed 24, 48 and 72 hours after administration. Bone marrow for mi cronuclei examination was prepared and after 
staining of the preparations 1000 polychromatic er ythrocytes (PCE) were evaluated per animal 
and investigated for micronuclei. The ratio of polychromatic (PCEs) to normochromatic (NCEs) 
erythrocytes was determined to determine inhibition of erythropoesis.   Results Clinical signs of lethargy, ptosis, diarrhoea a nd emaciation but no mortality were noted. Mice 
treated with Henna Rot showed no increase in the incidence of micronucleated PCEs when 
compared to the concurrent vehicle control group. A significant change in the NCE/PCE ratio SCCP/0943/05

 20was observed, indicating cytotoxicity of bone  marrow cells. The positive control exhibited 
increased numbers of micronucleated PCEs.  Conclusion Henna Rot (batch 830.72) did not induce micronucle i in the bone marrow of mice treated with 
300 mg/kg bw, a dose shown to cause clinical si gns and bone marrow toxicity. Thus, there was 
no indication for clastogenic potential of Henna Rot expressed in vivo  in this test.

In vivo UDS test with rat liver cells 
 
Guidelines: OECD 486 (1997) Species/strain: Rat/Wistar Group size: 3 male animals per dose Test Substance: Henna ( Lawsonia inermis , COLIPA n° C169) 
Batch: 1271 (1.36% 2-Hydroxy-1,4-Naphthoquinone) Dose level: 1000 and 2000 mg/kg bw Solvent: Corn oil Route: oral (gavage) Exposure period: 2 and 16 hours GLP: Yes  Henna Rot was assessed for its potential to indu ce DNA-damage and -repair in the in vivo UDS 
test using rat hepatocytes. The choice of dos e level was based on an initial range-finding study. 
The highest dose was in line with the requireme nt for the top dose according to the current 
guidelines. The application volume was 10 ml/kg bw. After the treatment periods, the animals 
were sacrificed and liver perfusion was carried  out. From each animal at least three primary 
hepatocytes cultures were established and exposed  for 4 hours to 3H-thymidine. The net nuclear 
grain counts were determined by counting two slides per animal and 50 cells per slide. Appropriate positive controls (N’N-dimethylhydr azinedihydrochloride at 40 mg/kg bw mg/kg 
bw for the 2 hour preparation interval and 2- acetylaminofluorene at 100 mg/kg bw for the 16 
hour preparation interval) were used.  Results Slight clinical findings in form of reduced activ ity and ruffled fur were observed in the treated 
rats. The viability of the hepatocytes was not significantly reduced. Treatment with 1000 or 2000 
mg/kg bw of Henna Rot did not induce UDS in the hepatocytes of the treated animals. The 
positive controls gave the expected genotoxic effect.  Conclusion Under the experimental conditions reported, the test substance did not induce DNA-damage, i.e. 
no increased repair synthesis in the hepatocytes of the treated rats. Therefore, Henna Rot ( Lawsonia inermis , batch 1271) was shown to be non-genotoxic in this in 
vivo UDS test when tested up to the highest dose level recommended by the guidelines.

 21In previous investigations, Henna Rot ( Lawsonia inermis, batch 830.72) induced structural 
chromosome aberrations in cultured human lymphocytes and gene mutations in the TK+/- 
mammalian cell gene mutation assay with mous e lymphoma cells. Two new genotoxicity tests 
with the batch 1271 (containing 1.36% 2-Hydroxy-1,4- Naphtochinon) led to negative results in 
the TK+/- mammalian cell gene mutation assay with mouse lymphoma cells and in an in vivo  
UDS test with rat hepatocytes. However, to  exclude a clastogenic potential of Henna rot 
(Lawsonia inermis ) additional testing with batch 1271 is required. An additional in vitro  
chromosome aberration test or (preferentially) an in vitro  micronucleus test should be performed. 
In case of a positive result appropriate in vivo  genotoxicity testing has to be considered.

The product Henna Rot was administered by daily  gavage to 100 pregnant female Sprague 
Dawley rats on day 6 through 15 of gestation at the dose levels of 40, 200 and 1000 mg/kg/day 
body weight and at a constant dose volume of  10 ml/kg/day according to the OECD N°414 
(1981). A control group was administered with the vehicle alone, a 0.5 % aqueous solution of 
methylcellulose. Pregnant animals were killed on day 20 of gestation; macroscopic examinations 
of the dams were performed, visceral and skelet al malformations were recorded on the foetuses. 
No clinical signs, no abortions and no mortalitie s were recorded in any female of any group 
during the study. However, a very slight but si gnificant decrease of body weight gain and food 
consumption was observed with the dams r eceiving 1000 mg/kg/day and was considered by 
investigators treatment-related. Pre and post-impl antation loss, foetal body weight and sex-ratio 
were similar between control and all treated groups. At the external examination, no treatment-related anomalies or malformations were obs erved. In the highest dose group, two foetuses 
revealed dilatation of cerebral ventricles (lateral ones or 3
rd one) and one foetus revealed cleft 
palate. At the skeletal examinations, reduced ossification of the pubic bone and cleft palate in one foetus were noted in the 200 mg/kg/day gr oup; a significant reduced ossification of caudal 
vertebra and unossification of the 5
th sternebra and the caudal vertebra, an increase in reduced 
ossification of the 1 st to 4 th metatarsals and of the pubic bone were noted in the 1000 mg/kg/day 
group. These foetal findings recorded at 200 and 1000 mg/kg/day were considered by the 
investigators to be probably treatment-related.  Under the experimental conditions adopted, th e NOAEL of the test product, Henna Rot, was 
established at 200 mg/kg/day for the pregnant female rats and at 40 mg/kg/day for the rat 
foetuses.

Marketed Henna represents a natural material derived from dried and powdered leaves of the 
plant Lawsonia inermis . Henna is used as a hair dye, base d on the staining properties of one of 
its constituents, e.g. Lawsone. Modified Henna produc ts, such as Black Henna are also available 
to consumers. The content of Lawsone among various modified Henna products may vary 
significantly, but these products contain some other substances for modifying the intensity of the 
colour provided by Henna alone. Aqueous pastes of  Henna are also used for skin decoration. The 
present opinion only refers to the use of Henna as hair dye.  
Toxicity The calculated median lethal dose was > 2000 mg/kg bw (acute oral and dermal). 
The NOAEL (No-Observed-Adverse-Effect-Level) of Henna Rot was 40 mg/kg bw (13 week day rat study); the NOAEL was 200 mg/kg/day for the pregnant female rats and 40 mg/kg/day for the rat foetuses (teratogenicity study).  
Irritation, sensitisation SCCP/0943/05 
 
Opinion on Lawsonia inermis  (Henna, C169) 
____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 23No separate skin irritation study was performed in experimental animals. However, Lawsonia 
inermis showed no irritative potential for the skin after a single occlusive application for 24 
hours, when tested for acute dermal toxicity (described above) under enforced conditions. Lawsonia inermis is slightly and transiently irritating to the eyes. 
The results of a Buehler test suggest that Lawsonia inermis  exhibited no potential to induce 
dermal sensitization in Guinea pigs under the cond itions used. However, skin staining may have 
compromised evaluation. There was no indication for any irritative or se nsitizing potential under the conditions of RIPT 
study in Human volunteers.  
Percutaneous absorption The cutaneous application of the aqueous Lawsonia inermis pulp spiked with [14C]-Lawsone to 
mimic human use conditions onto the skin of male and female rats led to a percutaneous absorption of 0.2% determined as radioactivity  after 72 hours, corresponding to an absolute 
absorption of 1.70 µg /cm². However, the exposur e time in this experiment was only 40 minutes, 
whereas the actual use duration will be up to 2 hours.  
Mutagenicity In previous investigations, Henna Rot ( Lawsonia inermis, batch 830.72) induced structural 
chromosome aberrations in cultured human lymphocytes and gene mutations in the TK
+/- 
mammalian cell gene mutation assay with mous e lymphoma cells. Two new genotoxicity tests 
with the batch 1271 (containing 1.36% 2-Hydroxy-1,4- Naphthochinon) led to negative results in 
the TK+/- mammalian cell gene mutation assay with mouse lymphoma cells and in an in vivo 
UDS test with rat hepatocytes. However, to  exclude a clastogenic potential of Henna rot 
(Lawsonia inermis ) additional testing with batch 1271 is required. An additional in vitro 
chromosome aberration test or (preferentially) an  in vitro micronucleus test should be performed. 
In case of a positive result appropriate in vivo genotoxicity testing has to be considered.   
4. CONCLUSION  
 
The SCCP is of the opinion that the information s ubmitted is insufficient to assess the safe use of 
the substance as a hair dye.  To exclude a clastogenic potential of Henna Rot ( Lawsonia inermis ), additional testing with 
batch 1271 is required. An additional in vitro  chromosome aberration test or (preferentially) an 
in vitro  micronucleus test should be performed. In case of a positive result, appropriate in vivo  
genotoxicity testing has to be considered.  The traditional and current expanding use of Henna Rot ( Lawsonia inermis ) as a body-paint has 
not been assessed.
