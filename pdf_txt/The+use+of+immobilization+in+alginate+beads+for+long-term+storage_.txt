SUMMARY  
 
Microalgae reckon one of the most promising organisms due to their numerous  applications in 
biotechnology, such as,  their biomass utilization to extract various primary and secondary metabolites. 
These compounds benefit the food and pharmaceutical industries and the energy field, such as, biofuel 
and hydrogen gas production. Therefore, it is necessary to find various s ustainable ways to actively 
preserve the isolates and productive strains with purity for an extended period without affecting their 
genetic characteristics and productive ability to grow and regenerate. The latest study aimed to 
compress  several microalgae  to form alginate beads using sodium alginate with five types of pure 
algal cultures, i.e., Scenedesmus quadricauda , Scenedesmus dimorphus , Chlorella  vulgaris , 
Chlorococcum humicola,  and Chlamydomonas sp. The vitality and activity of all the strains studie d 
through the storage period showed the success of preparing alginate beads and staying viable for 18 
months at 4 °C in the refrigerator under dark conditions. Therefore, encapsulating microalgae with 
sodium alginate is a possible and helpful method for pr eserving algae isolates for a prolonged period in 
a pure form. The survival of algae in alginate beads is an essential step to apply in the future as one 
of the viable methods to preserve pure algae isolates for a long time.

1295  INTRODUCTION  
 
Maintaining a microalgae culture is 
monotonous  and a time -consuming laboratory 
work. Therefore, researchers pursued 
developing new technologies for preserving 
these microorganisms (Abreu et al., 2012). In 
recent ye ars, microalgae usage in 
biotechnology has improved because small 
single cells and updated cell -freezing 
techniques have evolved to solve these 
obstacles in the biotechnological processes for 
these algae (Moreno -Garrido, 2008; Kareem et 
al., 2022 ).  
 The l ong-term stability and vitality of 
microalgae populations’ maintenance cannot 
prosper in serial sub -cultivation with liquid and 
solid media because of the labor -intensive 
contamination risks and genetic alteration. 
Therefore, cryopreservation is the only w ay to 
preserve microalgae cell viability at low 
temperatures for an extended term. The 
technology also protects them from genetic 
changes and requires minimal maintenance, 
storing them under appropriate conditions that 
minimize the risk of contamination by  other 
microorganisms (Demirel  et al ., 2018). 
Controlling  microalgae includes preventing the 
free movement of biological matter, with 
possible application to bacteria, yeasts, molds , 
and algae.  
 The first time freezing of algae cells 
occurred in the mid -1980s. The application of 
agar and alginate used granules with a bead -
like structure, which is the most common form 
for application (Goss et al.,  2020).  In stock 
culture and long -term storage of algae seeds 
for producing biomass and secondary 
metabolites, th e recommended extended 
preservation of algae cultures is in sodium 
alginate beads form. Such a method of algae 
preservation can also aid wastewater 
treatment and heavy metal removal 
(Santhoshkumar et al., 2016).  
 Alginate dependence was superior to 
agar co ncerning long -term storage (Kaur et al., 
2019). The fixation and encapsulation of 
microalgae comprised the cell retention 
techniques that helped fix the algae. Polymers, 
such as calcium alginate, and hardening agents, such as CaCl 2, form a hydrogel bead 
where algae can quickly grow. Thus, 
separating algae beads can be fast during 
laboratory experiments (Sewiwat et al., 2016). 
Sodium alginate is one of the most widely used 
polymers in formal algae immobilization, and 
inactivated microalgae have been benefic ial in 
removing nutrients in wastewater (Soo et al., 
2017).  Romo and Pherez -Martinez's (1997) 
study proved successful with their assessment 
of a new method for long -term storage of algae 
cultures, wherein the laboratory relies on cell 
encapsulation technol ogy. Encapsulating the 
filamentous cyanobacteria Pseudanabaena 
galeata  cells in sodium alginate gained storing 
in the refrigerator for 14 –18 months . 
Santhoshkumar et al . (2016) indicated the 
possibility of lengthened storage of the alga 
Chlorococcum humico la by regulating  algae 
cells in sodium alginate granules, which 
showed viability for up to 14 months.  
 Fixing microalgal strain cells in alginate 
beads gave success in preserving microalgae 
isolates, such as, Chroococcus  sp., Anabaena 
variabilis, Oscillat oria tenuis, Chlorella vulgaris, 
Chlorococcum humicola, Scenedesmus bijuga,  
and Selenastrum bibrainum  (Goss et al.,  
2020). The concerned study sought to prepare 
industrial seeds from sodium alginate of five 
types of microalgae in beads -like structure and 
then store them in the refrigerator for a long 
time. The second part of this study focused on 
following up on the numbers of growing cells 
from those algae fixed in alginate beads by 
cultivating them in an algae medium every 
three months to ascertain their ability to grow 
again after long -term storage.  
 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS  
 
Microalgae used  
 
The five algal isolates ( Scenedesmus 
quadicoda , Scenedesmus dimorphus , Chlorella  
vulgaris , Chlorococcum humicola,  and 
Chlamydomonas sp.) procured from several 
sources served as samples in the present 
research (Table 1).

Preparing alginate beads  
 
The use of sodium alginate aided in preparing 
the artificial seeds of t he microalgae. The 
preparation of 3% sodium alginate ran in the 
Chu 13 medium (free of CaCl 2.2H2O) with 
continuous stirring at 60 ᵒC in a water bath, 
then, adjusting the pH to 5.8, sterilizing the 
mixture continued in an autoclave for 20 min, 
based on the methodology by Santhoshkumar 
et al. (2016) and Al -Mula (2022). Taking 5 ml 
from each pure liquid culture of microalgae at 
the age of two weeks underwent centrifuging 
with added speed and condition of 
centrifugation. The sediment washing followed 
with disti lled water twice, with 1 ml of sterile 
distilled water added to the cell pellet, then 
mixed with 20 ml of sanitized sodium alginate 
solution earlier prepared. Then, dropping the 
mixture into a disinfected solution containing 
0.2 M calcium chloride, used a sterile pipette of 
beads -shaped loaded with algae cells. After 
leaving the beads for 30 min to harden, 
washing them with sterile distilled water 3 –4 
times took place. Then, drying proceeded 
under aseptic cond itions on sterile filter paper.  
 
Testing alginat e bead's vitality after a 
long period  
 
The alginate beads' viability and activity testing 
transpired every three months. Five beads 
underwent cultivation on 50 ml of Chu 13 
medium for 20 days. The number of cells 
counted growing in the medium per 1 ml 
received evaluation for their vitality after each 
incubation period (Santhoshkumar et al ., 
2016).  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
 
Formation of alginate beads  
 
Encapsulation of microalgae using sodium 
alginate as industrial seeds can be a ‎profitable 
method, as it req uires less energy and is easier 
to handle. Pure cultures and re -‎seeding stocks 
and microalgae contribute to various 
applications for  extended  storing while 
maintaining structural integrity of cells. Their 
vitality ‎and natural physiological activities ove r 
a long period removed long -term ‎storage 
culture methods for pure isolates, which can be 
an alternative to frequent re -cultivation to 
maintain the energy of microalgae and reduce 
pollution, costs, and ‎efforts.  
 Engaging various technologies included 
phytoremediations, algae treatment, the 
production of important secondary metabolites 
‎from algae, and biofuel and hydrogen 
production. Despite the ‎existence of limited 
studies in this aspect, the recent research 
successfully prepared alginate beads in a 
sterile manner for five isolates of microalgae, 
i.e., Scenedesmus quadicoda , Scenedesmus 
dimorphus , Chlorella  vulgaris , Chlorococcum 
humicola,  and Chlamydomonas sp.‎ The ‎results 
showed that the alginate grains formed were 
spherical to oval when ‎dropped into  a calcium 
chloride solution (Figure 1). The diameter of 
those beads ‎ranged between 6 –7 mm and 
appeared homogeneous regarding the 
distribution ‎of algal cells inside said beads 
(Figure 2). Immobilizing the microalga 
Scenedesmus quadricauda  for cultivation  in 
wastewater indicated that the beads’ diameters 
were 3.4, 4.0, and 4.7 mm (Porkka, 2021). SABRAO J. Breed. Genet. 55 (4) 1294-1301. http://doi.org/10.54910 /sabrao2023.55.4. 22

The diffe rence in the size of the beads was due 
to the diameters of the holes prepared in the 
pipette before dropping the beads into the 
sodium chloride solution (Al -Mula, 2022).  
 
Testing the vitality of microalgae inside 
alginate beads  
 
When studying the vitality of algae 
encapsulation with sodium alginate, the results 
showed the stages of releasing  the algae from 
the alginate beads with time ‎during growing 
the algae on Chu 13 medium for testing its 
vitality after every three months (Figure 3). 
Developing algae, after 20 days of ‎incubation 
(Figure 4), revealed the algae used were able 
to grow after being cultured on the ‎medium for regular pe riods until the last 18th month. ‎The 
results also ‎‎showed the number of microalgae 
cells grown on the ‎culture medium to detect 
their strength (Table 2). A continuous decrease 
in the number  of cells to each ml-1 after each 
storage period, even reaching i ts lowest level 
in the last month (18th), ‎emerged (Figure 5).   
 The number of developing cells also 
decreased to their lowest numbers ‎resulting 
from the continuous decline during the storage 
period as earlier discussed, indicating that the 
physiological state of the algae cells had the 
storage passing of time affecting it, or perhaps 
due to the accumulation of carbon dioxide gas 
in the storage vessels during the ‎continuous 
respiration process. Moreover, the components 
of a culture ‎medium may have influe nced theAl-Someidae et al. (2023)

compared with the study of Santhoshkumar et 
al. (‎‎2016), who observed the stability in the 
number of growing cells of the alga Chlo. 
humicola  during a ‎bioassay of alginate beads 
for 14 months using a BBM medium.  
 For the number of cells, differences 
occurred between ‎the types of microalgae in 
terms of cell number and their ability to persist 
with the immense ‎number of cells from the 
first month until the last month (Figure 5, 
Table 2). In the 18th month of storage, 
notably, the best of these ‎algae were S. 
dimorphus  and S. quadicoda , which came cl ose 
in the number of developing ‎cells in the last 
month at 02.81×106 and 02.69×106, 
respectively, perhaps due to their belonging to 
the same genus, followed by ‎the alga Chlo. 
humicola.  Based on the ‎lowest numbers of 
developing cells, it came from the al ga 
Chlamydomonas sp. and C. ‎vulgaris  at 
0.66×106 and 0.34×106, respectively, which 
appears more sensitive to survival for a 
lengthy period in alginate beads compared ‎with 
the rest of the algae under study.  
 The studied algae proved their ability 
to ‎remain vigorous for 18 months, a relatively 
extended period. Senko et al. (2022) found 
that using PVA cryogel (polyvinyl alcohol) to 
immobilize the  cells of various phototrophic  
microorganisms led to successful storage for 
two years at -20 °C without reducing  their 
metabolic activity. Other studies also indicated 
that the algae Euglena gracilis  fixed in alginate 
beads remained active for ‎over two years 
(Abdel -Hameed and Hammouda, 2007). The 
findings of Romo and Perez -‎Martinez (1997) 
signified that the algae Pseudanabaena galeata  
(Cyanobacteria) loaded on ‎alginate beads, and 
stored for a long time, maintained its viability. 
Yean-Chang (2 001) also kept the green ‎alga S. 
quadricauda  as alginate beads for a long time, 
where the cells retained ‎their physiological 
activity and survival for three years in 
complete ‎darkness. It means that cells can 
maintain their physiological activities for the 
long term by consuming their reserves of 
pyrenoids (Moheimani et al ., 2015). Yean -
Chang (2001) also confirmed the survival of 
alga Isochrysis galbana  cells ‎actively loaded 
with sodium alginate after a year of storage, which is the same period as menti oned by 
Abdel -Hameed (2005) on algae C. vulgaris  
cells encapsulated by alginate.  
 
 
CONCLUSIONS  
 
The results revealed that encapsulating the 
microalgae with alginate sodium is possible 
with great benefits to preserve the algal 
isolates for a long time in a pure form. Despite 
the decrease in the number of cells during the 
storage period, the s urvival of algae active in 
the alginate beads is an essential step for its 
application in the future.
