 2Abstract  
A ZnO–TiO 2/Clay  photcatalyst was prepared using a natural  Tunisian clay as support. Its 
activity was assayed in the photocatalytic degradation of methyl green in aqueous solutions , 
in the presence of UVA irradiation . The photocatalyst was synthesized using a metal organic 
chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) with Ti (OPri)4 deposed on the natural Na+–Clay , 
followed by a  modified sol –gel synthesis method for introduction. The sample was then 
characteri zed by  scanning electronic microscopy  (SEM), High -resolution transmission 
electron microscopy (HRTEM), N 2 adsorption , X-ray diffraction (XRD) and titration for the 
determination of the zero point charge  (pH ZPC). The activity tests  showed that the 
photodegr adation efficiency for ZnO –TiO 2/Clay is higher than  for the  TiO 2/Clay  catalyst, 
clearly pointing to a promoting effect of ZnO . The influence of operational paramet ers such as 
pH, catalyst dosage, initial dye concentration , UV irradiati on intensity , as well  as the 
influence of the presence of different oxidants was evaluated . Almost comp lete mi neralization 
was obtained upon 3 0 min of light irradiation in the presence of the ZnO –TiO 2/Clay catalyst.

1. Introduction  
Organic dyes represent an important source of environmental contamination, since  
they are toxic and mostly non -biodegradable  [1]. Conventional treatment methods, such as 
biodegradation, adsorption flocculation –coagulation , electro -coagulation  and conventional 
chemical oxidation , are not effective enough in achieving complete removal of these organic 
compounds from industrial wastewater s [2]. Therefore, different advanced oxidation 
process es, AOPs , have been developed in the last decades in order to boost the oxidation of 
recalcitrant pollutants, through the generation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals ( •OH) [3–
6]. 
Among the different AOPs, h eterogeneous semiconductor photocatalysis has been 
recently presented as  a promising technology allowing the  total mineralization of different 
refractory  organic compounds , in the presence of either natural or artificial ligh t. Titanium 
dioxide (TiO 2) is one of the most commonly used materials for pho tocatalytic applications 
due to  its hi gh chemical stability, low cost, low toxicity,  and excellent oxidation properties 
[4,5]. TiO 2 is a semiconductor with a bandgap energy range of 3 –3.2 eV, depending on its 
crystalline structure (rutile or anatase) [4,5]. TiO 2 fine powders such as DEGUSSA P25 have 
been commercially available for several years. Nevertheless, the photocatalyst  must still be 
removed from the treated suspension  though an additional separation step that represents an 
important drawback towards  the practical application of these processes [4]. In order to avoid 
this separation step , the photocatalytically active phase  (e.g. TiO 2) can be  immobilized on the 
surface of an structured support. Different materials  such as silica [7], perlite [8], fly ash [9] , 
zeolites [10] activated carbon s [11,12]  and clay s [13–16] have been used with this purpose . 
Among them, clays and clay -based materials represent a highly promising  alternative  due to 
their high mechanical and chemical stability, high surface are a and high adsorption capacity  
 4[13–15]. Moreover clays are environmenta l friendly, low -cost and offer an interesting route 
for the revalorization of local resources.  
Doping or surface modification by transition metals is considered one of the most 
efficient methods in reducing electron –hole recombination  [6, 17–24]. The metal on the 
surface of the photocatalyst can act as a trap site for the photo -generated electrons, which can 
prevent electron –hole recombination, and thereby improve photocatalytic activity. For 
instance, Zhang and co -workers prepared a novel SnO 2–TiO 2–Clay synthesized by attachment 
of SnO 2–TiO 2 oxides onto the surface of the clay (palygorskite, attapulgite) by in situ sol –gel 
technique. Compared with origin clay and pure TiO 2, these materials  exhibited considerably 
higher photocatalytic activity in the photodecomposition of phenol and methyl orange  in 
water solution [21,22]. In a subsequent work [24], Zhang et al. reported  the preparation of a 
magnetically recoverable TiO 2–FexOy composite loaded onto the surface of attapulgite. This 
material  showed significant  photocatalyticactivity in  the degradation of methyl orange (MO ) 
under visible light irradiation. Enhanced activity was attributed to the modification of the  
electronic energy band structu re of TiO 2 in the presence  of nearby FexOy, resulting in 
extended photocatalytic  absorbance  in the visible light region.  ZnO can be as well used as a 
promoter of photocatalytic activity. In fact, bulk systems containing ZnO have been deeply 
studied in the last decade [ 25-29]. However, only few and recent works focus on the 
preparation of TiO 2-ZnO supported heterogeneous catalyst for the photocatalytic degradation 
of organic pollutants in wastewaters [ 30-32]. Among them, TiO 2-ZnO/BC composite s 
exhibited a hi gh photocatalytic activity and could remove humic acids from water efficiently 
under visible light irradiation  [30]. To date, the use of ZnO -promoted TiO 2 systems supported 
on clays has been never considered.  
In the present study, a natural Tunisian clay w as used as the matrix for the 
immobilization of TiO 2 and ZnO . These compounds were loaded  on the clay surface by  
 5means of  in-situ metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD)  and via sol-gel 
synthesis , respectively . The p hotocatalytic activity of this c lay-supported ZnO -promoted TiO 2 
was assayed in the oxidation  of methyl green  (MG)  dicationic  dye. The influence of key 
operational parameters, such as pH , catalyst dosage, initial dye concentration , oxidant type 
(H2O2, K2S2O8, Na 2CO 3), has been  as well considered . 
2. Experimental  
2.1. Raw material s and reagents  
A natural clay from the  Jebel Tejera -Esghira  deposits located in the Southeast of 
Tunisia  (Medenine ) was used in this study. This  natural clay was first purified by dispersion 
in water, decantation a nd extraction of the fraction with a particle size smaller than 2 μm, and 
subsequently modi ﬁed through  sodium ion-exchange , as carefully described in previous 
work s [14, 33]. Titanium (IV) -isopropoxide, (Ti(OPri)4, TTIP, 97 %), z inc acetate dehydrate  
(Zn(C H3COO) 2·2H 2O ≥98%)  and Methyl Green  dye (MG, cationic, C.I. 42000, chemical 
formula C 23H25N2Cl, FW = 364.91 g/mol)  were used without further purification.  
2.2. Preparation of the photocatalysts  
The TiO 2/Clay photocatalyst was prepared following a  metal org anic chemical vapor 
deposition method (MOCVD), in a similar way  to the procedure  reported by Omri et al . [11]. 
The desired  amount (4.0 g) of the ion -exchanged Na+ - Clay ( particle size <  63 mm) was 
introduced in  a quartz reactor, and dehydrated under a str eam of dry nitrogen at 400 °C for 3 h. 
Then, the temperature of the reactor was raised to 600 °C. Once  the temperature was sta ble, 
the vapor deposition of TiO 2 was initiated through the evaporation of  TTIP contained in a 
flask at 100 °C, under a nitrogen flo w of 200 mL/min for 5 h. The gas line was heated to 
prevent  TTIP condensation. At the end of the deposition, the reactor was purged with nitrogen 
for about 15 min.   
 6ZnO–TiO 2/Clay was synthesized via an optimized  sol–gel route  [34]. 4.38 g of 
dehydrated zinc acetate w ere dissolved in 100 ml of ethanol  and stirred  in a water bath at 
50°C. 2.98 g of tri -ethanol amine were subsequently added to the solution while stirring was 
continued for 1 h. The mixture was then placed under vibration and heated for 0.5 h at  40°C, 
resulting in a colorless and transparent sol . At this instant,  3 g of TiO 2/Clay  were added  to this 
sol. The suspension was further agitated under vibration for another 0.5 h, filtered, dried and 
calcined for 4 h at 300 °C. 
2.3. Characterization of the photo catalysts  
In order to determine the structure  and morphology  of ZnO –TiO 2/Clay, TiO 2/Clay and 
the original clay were examined by  scanning electronic mi croscopy (SEM, Hitachi SU -70) 
and high -resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM , JEOL JEM 2 011 equipped 
with LaB6 filament ). The  HRTEM  images were collected with a 4008 × 2672 pixel CCD 
camera (GatanOrius SC1000) coupled with the DIGITAL MICROGRAPH software. Coupled 
chemical analyses were obtained by an EDX microanalyzer (PGT IMIX PC). Nitrogen 
adsorption –desorption isotherms for the different materials were acquired  at -196 °C on a 
Micromeritics ASAP 2010 , after out gassing (10-5 Pa) for 24 h at ambient temperature.  
Surface areas were calculated using the BET equation , whereas mean  pore size , pore size  
distribution and pore volume were estimated using the  BJH method.  X-ray diffraction patterns  
(XRD) were acquired  in a Philips –PW 1710 diffractometer (Cu K, 40 kV/40 mA, scanning 
rate 2 degree/min) . Crystal  sizes were  calculated through X-ray line b roadening analysis using 
Scherrer equation . The relative content of anatase and rutile, was estimated using Spurr –
Myers equation  [11].  The zero point charge  (pH ZPC) of the prepared materials was determined 
following  the method described by Bouzid et al. [35].  
 7 
2.4. Photocatalytic tests  
The photocatalytic experiments were carried out in a static quartz reactor ( 500 mL), 
equipped with a cold finger to avoid thermal reactions. A UV -A lamp (λ max = 365nm, Black -
Ray B 100 W UV -lamp, V -100AP series ) was placed ne xt to the reactor , at 30 cm  of the 
liquid surface . In each experiment, 1g of photocatalyst was added into 250 mL of MG 
solution ( 75 mg/L, pH = 5.2) . Before illumination, the dispersion was magnetically stirred 
for 20 min (in the dark ), in order to ensure a dsorption equilibrium between the photocatalyst  
surface  and the organic dye.  
The influence of the pH of the initial solution was evaluated at pHs from 2.5 to 10  
(adjusted using HCl (0.1 M) and NaOH (0.1 M) ), while  MG concentration was fixed at 75 
mg/L , for 1 g/L of  ZnO–TiO 2/Clay  photocatalyst. Catalyst dosage was varied from 0.1 to 2 
g/L, for 75 mg/L of MG solution, at pH= 6.32. The influence of the MG dye concentration was 
also evaluated by varying its concentration from 25  mg/L to 150  mg/L, at a fixed pH o f 6.32, 
in the presence of 0.8 g  of ZnO –TiO 2/Clay photocatalyst.  8 mL of H 2O2, K 2S2O8 or Na 2CO 3 
(prepared from 250 mg/L of H 2O2 (35%), K 2S2O8 (98%) or Na 2CO 3 (98%)) were added into 
the reaction solution just before switching on the light,  with the aim of assaying  the influence  
of the presence  of an oxidizing  agent , or, in the case of Na2CO 3 as a way to buffer  the solution  
pH into basic  values.  
The stability of the ZnO –TiO 2/Clay  photocatalyst was assayed by means of 
performing five consecutive experiments by  using fresh 75 mg/L MG solutions, at pH 6.32 
and 0.8 g/L catalyst. Between each experiment, the photocatalyst was removed by filtration, 
carefully washed with distilled, and dried at 110 °C for 12 h.  
Solution aliquots were periodically withdrawn from the  reaction vessel with the aid of 
a syringe and at predetermined intervals . Upon  filtration using  a 0.45 µm membrane, the dye  
 8concentration was determined in a Shimadzu 160A UV–visible spectrophotometer, at the 
maximal adsorption wavelength of MG, λmax=632 nm. 
The decolorization efficiency  was calculated as follows  (1): 
 (1) 
where, A0 represents the initial absorbance  of the MG solution, and A t its absorbance after  t 
minutes of irradiation/reaction . 
Chemical oxygen demand (COD) was determined us ing the reactor digestion method based 
on the method of acidic oxidation by bichromate.  
3.1. Physico -chemical characterization  
The SEM micrographs acquired for the raw and the modified clays are presented in 
Fig. 1 . Upon TiO 2 addition, the surface morpholo gy of the Na+– exchanged clay changes 
significantly (Fig.1  a vs. Fig. 1 b ). The unloaded clay  present s large  particle aggregates with 
smooth surfaces whereas after MOCVD of Ti isopropoxide, an homogeneous distribution of 
TiO 2 grains completely covers the s urface of the original clay . The ZnO–TiO 2/Clay catalyst, 
Fig 1. c, shows the spongelike surface with ZnO particles  covering the TiO 2 structures.  TEM 
images further confirm the se changes in the morphology of the different materials  (Fig. 2). 
ZnO and TiO 2 nanocomposites are observed on to the surface of the clay, with an  average 
particle size was about 10 nm.  
The X -ray diffraction patterns for Na+−Clay, TiO 2/Clay and ZnO −TiO 2/Clay are shown in  
Fig. 3. The typical diffraction peaks of quartz, kaolinite and ill ite are evidenced in the 
spectrum acquired for the clay, pointing to their presence as the main crystalline phases [14, 
36]. The XRD patterns of TiO 2/Clay catalyst show the appearance of peaks at 2θ angles of 
25.3°, 37.9°, 48.4°, 55.3° and 62.7 ° correspond ing to the (101), (103), (200), (105) and (213)  
 9crystalline planes of its anatase form [12, 14, 16, 24] (JCPDS Card No. 21 -1272 ). Upon  ZnO 
loading , new peaks are observed pointing to the presence  of a ZnO zincite phase  in the 
ZnO−TiO 2/Clay  material (2θ = 3 1.8, 34.4, 36.2, 47.5, 56.6, 62.9 and 67.9° corresponding to 
(100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103) and (112) reflections, JCPDS Card No. 001 -1136. The 
diffraction peaks at 25.”°, 37.9°, 48.376°, 55.3° and 62.7° correspond to the (101), (103), 
(200), (10 5) and (213) planes of anatase [ 37, 38 ], JCPDS Card No. 21 -1272 . Other peaks 
mainly at 27.2° can be assigned to (101) diffraction planes of rutile, JCPDS No. 21 -1272 [ 39]. 
The relative content of anatase and rutile was estimated using Spurr –Myers equation  
[40]: 
 (2) 
Where A (%) is the relative content of anatase, I A and I R are the intensities of the 
anatase (101) peak at 2 θ= 25.3° and the rutile (101) peak at 2 θ=27.2°. The anatase content of 
ZnO−TiO 2/Clay around 9 7% points  to the predominant presence of this phase in the prepared 
photocatalyst.  Anatase content further increases upon the addition of ZnO.  
The crystal size of TiO 2 was calculated from the XRD profiles using the Debye –
Scherrer equation. The average sizes of TiO 2 crystallite in the catalyst are listed in Table 1 . 
Crystal  sizes around 17 nm were found to be independent of the presence of ZnO in the 
photocatalyst co mposition.  
Table 1 contains as well the values of surface area, pore volume and mean pore 
diameter calculated from the corresponding nitrogen adsorption isotherms acquired for each 
material. T he specific surface area  increases substantially as a consequen ce of TiO 2 loading, 
i.e. from 37  m2/g in the Na+–Clay to 105 m2/g in the ZnO−TiO 2/Clay. This increase in surface 
area is due to the creation of a porous TiO 2 phase on the clay surface. Pore volume slightly 
decreases upon ZnO incorporation to the catalyst, p ointing to a slight pore blockage of the  
 10 TiO 2 surface . Figure 4 contains the N 2 adsorption isotherms as well as the BJH pore size 
distributions calculated for the different materials.  
Figure 5 shows evolution of  ΔpH, i.e., (pH 0–pHf) as a function of  pH during pHZPC 
measurement s. The zero point charnge  for the  TiO 2/Clay and ZnO −TiO 2/Clay were found to 
be 7.4 and 6. 4, respectively.  
3.2. Catalytic activity  in the decolorization  of Methyl G reen solutions  
The photocatalytic activity in the  decolorization  of MG f or the different materials is 
shown in Figure 6. Under dark  reaction  conditions , about 29 %; 25  % and 18% decolorization 
was measured respectively for  ZnO–TiO 2/Clay , TiO 2/Clay  and the parent Na+−clay, from a 
100 mg/L MG solution after 20 min  irradiation . This can be simply assigned to the adsorption 
of the dye organic molecule on the materials’ surface, since it is in complete agreement with 
the increase of surface area upon TiO 2 and ZnO loading . Photolysis of MG under UV 
irradiation in absence of any  photo catalyst  results in negligible MG degradation for 60 min. In 
the presence of UV light and either ZnO–TiO 2/Clay , TiO 2/Clay  or the  Na+−clay, 98.7%, 
87.2% and 32.6% decolorization  were respectively measured  60 minutes  irradiation . The 
enhanced photocatalytic activity of ZnO –TiO 2/Clay can be attributed to the increased 
presence of anatase in its composition [41], together with the positive  influence of ZnO acting 
as a promoter of the photocatalytic activity , by means of extending the adsorption of the 
incident radiation  [29, 30] . The preparation procedure results in separated TiO 2 and ZnO 
phases that enhance the adsorption of the incident i rradiation and avoiding the combination of 
electron -hole pairs through a one -way charge transfer mechanism [29].  
 
3.3. Influence of operational parameter s  
 11 The photocatalytic activity  is strongly affecte d by the surface charge properties  of the 
material , the charge of the molecule,  the adsorption of the organic molecule on the  
photocatalyst surface and on the concentration of hydroxyl radical s [30, 42-45]. All these 
properties are  pH dependent. Therefore pH is an important operation al parameter determining 
the efficiency of the photocatalytic removal of different pollutants in wastewaters. The effect 
of varying pH from 3 to 10 in the initial MG solution is shown in Fig. 7, for an initial MG 
concentration of 75 mg/L, over ZnO–TiO 2/Clay (1 g/L), and under UV irr adiation.  The 
decolorization efficiency  of MG increases significantly, i.e.  from 32.1 % to almost 100%,  
upon an increase in solution  pH from 2.8 to 6.32.  Decolorization  efficiency decreases with a 
further increase in pH, proving that the pH of the dye solut ion determines the adsorption  of 
the organic compound  on the surface of ZnO –TiO 2/Clay  and represents an  important reaction 
step in the overall mechanism of dye oxidation  [46]. Adsorption and thus dye degradation 
seem to be favored at pH around the zero poi nt charge pH (pH zpc), i.e. 6.4 for the ZnO –
TiO 2/Clay is . At a pH lower than 6.4  the surface of ZnO –TiO 2/Clay photo catalyst is positively 
charged, whereas at pH higher than 6.4 it becomes negatively charged. Since MG is a 
dicationic type dye, a pH higher th an that corresponding to the zero point charge  favors the 
adsorption of MG molecule on the catalyst surface which results in enhanced  degradation  of 
MG under neutral and basic conditions. However, a further increase in pH leads to an increase 
coulombic rep ulsion  between the negative charged ZnO−TiO 2/Clay surface and the 
OH−species involved in the photocatalytic oxidation mechanism [47], leading to decreased 
degradation efficiency.  
Fig. 8 shows the influence of the catalyst dosage on the decolorization effic iency . 
When  the amount of the cataly st is increased in the range 0.1– 0.8 g/L , the decolorization 
efficiency  increa ses from 32% to almost 100%  after 60 min of irradiation time. This is due to 
the increase in the catalyst concentration and thus of the amoun t of sites available for  
 12 absorption of photons and dye molecules . However,  further  increasing the catalyst dosage 
from  0.8 to 2.0 g/L  resulting in a  slight decrease in the  decolorization efficiency . Excess of 
catalyst leading to substantial particle agglom eration may explain this fact, as previously 
described in the existing literature [16, 48]. Moreover, a more concentrated catalyst 
suspension may lead to decrease of its transparency resulting in less efficient radiation 
penetration.  
In view of the practic al application of the photocatalytic process in the presence of the 
ZnO–TiO 2/Clay catalyst, the influence of dye concentration on the degradation efficiency 
must be analyzed [14, 49, 50]. Decolorization efficiency was then measured during the 
photocatalyti c degradation of MG solutions at different concentrations from 25 to 150 mg/L. 
Results are presented in Fig. 9. As the concentration of MG in the initial solution increases, 
longer irradiation times are needed for attaining the same decolorization efficien cy. 
The data plotted in Fig. 9 were used for the calculation of the apparent kinetic 
constants for different reaction conditions. The rate of degradation of organic compounds in 
wastewaters can be described by a pseudo -first order Langmuir –Hinshelwood kine tic model : 
  (3) 
Where  r stands for  the rate of degradation, K represents the equilibrium constant for 
the adsorption of MG on the catalyst  surface,  and kr denotes the kinetic constant for the 
degradation reaction at maximum surface c overage . 
On integrating Equation ( 3), we obtain the irradiation time, t, for attaining a 
concentration C t of the pollutant:  
 (4)  
 13 Where C 0 represents the initial concentration of MG.  Therefore a t low C0, the second 
term in Equation (4 ) becomes insignifi cant and hence can be neglected:  
 (5) 
With  kapp as the apparent rate constant for the  photocatalytic degradation reaction . 
The almost perfect  linearity of the ln(C 0/Ct) versus t plot s for various initial MG 
concentrations , Fig. 10,  proves  the applicability of the Langmuir –Hinshelwood equation for 
the photoca talytic degradation of MG . The apparent rate constant, k app, decreases as the initial 
concentr ation of MG increases. At too high  MG concentrations, a greater amount of dye  
molecule s adsorb on the catalyst surface  blocking  the photocatalytical ly active sites on the 
catalyst, thus reducing the absorption of photons, their interaction with the active sites and 
therefore  inhibiting the photocatalytic degradation process . In addition, increasing MG 
concentration leads to a larger fraction of the UV irradiation  that is  absorbed by the dye 
molecules in the water solution , instead of being absorbed by the catalytically active sites  [16, 
47, 48]. 
Several works in the existing literature  point to the a ddition of oxidants as an efficient 
way of improving the photodegradation of organic pollutants in waste waters [14, 47, 48 ]. 
The influence of the presence  of different oxidizing agents  such as hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2), 
and potassium peroxodisulfate (K 2S2O8), together with  sodium carbonate (Na 2CO 3) as pH 
buffer,  on the deg radation of MG was studied at an initial pH of 6.32, on a 100 mg/L of dye 
solution  and in the presence of 0.8 g .L-1 of the ZnO –TiO 2/Clay catalyst.  Table 2 contains the 
decolorization effic iency measured after 60 min irradiation in the presence of the different 
oxidants. As expected, the addition of these compounds e nhances the photodegradation of 
MG. This is due to the photo -activated formation of •OH, SO 4-• and CO 3-• /HCO 3• radicals 
during  reaction  that contribute to faster dye oxidation. A mong the three oxidants assayed,   
 14 H2O2 was found to be the most efficient in enhancing the degradation of MG , followed by 
K2S2O8 and Na2CO 3. Note that the effect of Na 2CO 3 may be rather assigned to a basif ication 
of the reaction pH, or even to a catalytic effect in the presence of sodium ions 49. 
3.4. Mineralization  
UV–vis absorption spectra of the dye solution were acquired at different reaction 
timed and are presented in Figure 1 1. The degradation exper iment  was performed at pH = 6.3, 
75 mg/L dye concentration, 0. 6 g/L of ZnO –TiO 2/Clay photocatalyst. The initial Methyl 
green (MG) solution UV -visible spectra presents four absorption peaks the prominent peak at 
632 nm and other peaks at 420 nm, 315 nm and s maller peak at 256 nm. The peak at 632 nm  
decreases gradually by the addition of ZnO –TiO 2/Clayand disappears within 30 min. The 
decrease of the sample’s absorbance intensity at its λmax=632nm is indicated by the 
photodegradation of the dye in the applied c onditions. As a consequence the decrease of 
samples absorbance due to decrease of the dye concentration was recorded for measurement 
of photodegradation rate in all above -mentioned parameters. Since there are no additional 
peaks appearing in the UV –vis spe ctra the dye is thus completely degraded.  The percentages 
of COD reduction measured are presented in Table 2. These values point to almost complete 
mineralization even in the absence of oxidant, i.e. upon 30 min irradiation, 100% 
decolorization is achieved  corresponding to a percentage of COD reduction of 89.3%. U sing 
H2O2 as oxidant leads to faster and more efficient mineralization than when using th e two 
other chemical agents.  
3.5.Stability of the ZnO –TiO 2/Clay  photocatalyst  
The stability of the ZnO –TiO 2/Clayphotocatalyst was evaluated in five consecutive 
experiments by using fresh MG solutions at concentration of 75 mg/L, pH 6.3, and 0. 8g/L  
 15 catalyst. Between each experiment, the photo catalyst was removed by filtration, then washed 
with distilled water sev eral times, and dried at 110 °C for 12 h.  
Degradation efficiency of the Methyl Green by ZnO –TiO 2/Clayphotocatalyst was still 
higher than 95% after being used in the three subsequent cycles. The photocatalytic 
degradation efficiency was 98.3% during the fir st 2 cycles (Fig. 12). The photocatalyst 
activity slightly dropped in runs 4 and 5, resulting in 97.2% and 9 5.81% degradation, 
respectively. The deactivation of the photocatalyst is likely related to some surface poisoning 
that may be induced by adsorbed i ntermediates. We could also note, after analyzing the 
solutions after runs, that no species coming from catalysts were detected. The experimental 
observation of Dutta and Ray [50] indicated that strongly adsorbed intermediates occupied the 
active sites on the catalyst surface and led to a slight  loss of photocatalytic  activity. As 
conclusion , this result further proves that suchZnO−TiO 2/Clay catalyst s possess  an adequate 
stability, presenting only small decay in its degradation efficiency.  
 
Conclusions  
 ZnO-TiO 2 was successfully supported on a ion exchanged Tunisian clay and used as a 
photocatalyst for the degradation of methyl gre en aqueous solutions.  
The experimental results indicate that th is ZnO–TiO 2/Clay catalyst  show s high 
photocatalytic activity, higher than the Na+–exchanged c lay and TiO 2/Clay , pointing to a 
positive effect of the presence of ZnO in the catalytic compositio n, due to the suitable 
arrangement of their respecti ve valence and conduction bands, favoring both electron and hole 
transfer and hindering their recombination. The photodegradation of MG was significantly 
influenced by  the initial pH  of the solution , the catalyst dosage and the initial dye 
concentration.  The addition of oxidants  modestly enhanced the degradation rate, since almost  
 16 complete mineralization remains possible in the single presence of the ZnO–TiO 2/Clay 
catalyst upon  only 30 minutes of irradiati on. The Tunisian clay was thus found to be a 
suitable support for preparing well dispersed and highly active TiO 2 and ZnO phases, showing 
at the same time good chemical stability through catalyst use.
