SUMMARY
Trypanosome infection of mammalian hosts leads, within days, to a strong early response against a small, distinct number
of parasite proteins. One of these proteins is the variable surface glycoprotein (VSG). Most of the others are apparentlynon-variable, intracellular trypanosome proteins. Two of these antigens I
2 and I 17 are now characterized at the molecular
level. Both exhibit a highly repetitive amino acid sequence organization, but they show no sequence similarity either  to
each other or to any other proteins known to date. Preliminary serological analyses indicate that both allow the early,sensitive and specific detection of infections with different species of trypanosomatids, making them interesting candidates
for the development of diagnostic tools for trypanosomiasis detection.

INTRODUCTION
The strong immune response  of a  mammalian host
infected with African trypanosomes  is mainly  di-
rected against the variant surface glycoprotein, VSG
(Cross, 1990) and is not protective (Seed & Sechelski,
1987;  DeGee, Levine & Mansfield, 1988). This lack
of protectivity is because of the high variability of the
parasite's surface coat during  the  course  of the
infection. Much effort has been directed towards the
search  for  invariant antigens both  as  tools  for
diagnosis  and  as potential targets  for  vaccine  de-
velopment. Such antigens are often high molecular
weight proteins and associated with the flagellum  or
the cytoskeleton  of the parasite (Lafaille et al. 1989;
Ruiz et al. 1990; dos Santos et al. 1992). Muller et al.
(1992) have identified  2 invariant, repetitive high
molecular weight proteins associated with the cyto-
skeleton  of the  parasite which exhibited  a high
immunodiagnostic sensitivity. Time-course studiesof the infection demonstrated that these
 2 antigens
were representatives  of a  whole group  of  high
molecular weight (HMW) antigens which  are  all
recognized very early  in infection (Muller  et al.
1993).  Based  on these findings, we have designed  a
screening strategy specifically aimed  at identifying
additional members  of this group.  A cDNA library
from bloodstream  T. gambiense was screened with
affinity-purified antibodies against high molecular
weight cytoskeleton proteins.  The  present study
reports the identification of two new antigens, I 2 and
I17, by this strategy. Both exhibit  a high repetitive
sequence organization,  and  both  are  structural
elements  of the cytoskeleton.MATERIALS  AND  METHODS
Trypanosomes
The trypanosomes used  for  cytoskeletal prepara-
tions,  Western blot analysis, immunofluorescense
and immunogold electron microscopy were  all pro-
cyclic forms  of  Trypanosoma brucei brucei clone
EATRO 427. They were grown in SDM-79 medium(Brun
 & Schonenberger, 1979) supplemented with
haemin  and  5 % foetal calf serum. The cells were
harvested during exponential growth at a cell densityof about 5xlO
6/ml.
Sera
Trypanosome cytoskeletons were prepared  as de-
scribed  by Hemphill  et al. (1991). Briefly, trypano-
somes from 10 ml of culture were washed  3 times  in
MME (10 mM Mops/1 mM MgCl 2/0-2 mM EGTA,
pH 6-9)  and  incubated  in MME containing 05 %
Triton X-100  for  lOmin  on ice. After  a centrifug-
ation at 3000  £ for  lOmin the Triton X-100-insol-
uble cytoskeleton fraction was washed once  in PBS
(137 mM NaCl/2-7 mM KC1/8-1 mM Na 2HPO 4/
1-5 mM KH 2PO 4, pH 72) and resuspended in 100 ml
of PBS. Rats were inoculated intraperitoneally withthis cytoskeleton material either
 in complete  (1st
inoculation) or incomplete (2nd and 3rd inoculation)Freund's adjuvants. Blood was finally collected
 by
cardiac puncture. Sera from experimentally infectedmice were taken 14 days after an experimental infec-
tion with the LouTat 1 strain
 of T.  b. brucei (DeGee
et al. 1988). The bovine sera used for the evaluation

 congo-
lense. The control sera originated from young (10months) Zebu cattle. All bovine sera were kindlyprovided by Dr R. Mattioli, International Trypano-tolerance Centre (ITC) in Banjul, The Gambia.
Lambda gtll cDNA
 expression  of T. b. gambiense
The cDNA expression library from bloodstreamform T. b. gambiense (stock TREU 1285) wasconstructed in the cloning vector Agtl
 1 as described
(Barnes et al. 1989) and was kindly provided by DrM. Selkirk (Department of Biochemistry, Imperial
College of Science, Technology and Medicine,London).
Immunoscreening  of a cDNA library and
construction of  recombinant A  lysogen
The Agtl  1 expression library of T.  b. gambiense  was
screened for clones corresponding to high molecularweight proteins. The antibody used for screeningwas prepared as follows. Whole procyclic trypano-some lysates (see below) were fractionated by
SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose filters.
After staining with 0-04% Ponceau S in 10% acetic
acid, the high molecular weight region of the filter( > 180 kDa) was excised and used for affinity-purification of the antibodies from hyperimmune ratserum raised against trypanosome cytoskeletons(Muller et al. 1992).
Affinity purification of
 antibodies on  fusion protein
Affinity purification of antibodies from rat anti-cytoskeleton hyperimmune serum on /?-galactosidase
fusion proteins was done as described by Muller
 et al.
(1992).  The affinity-purified antibodies were used at
a dilution of 1:10 for Western blot analysis,
immunofluorescence and immunogold electron mi-
croscopy.(Laemmli, 1970). The cytoskeletal fraction wasobtained by resuspending 4-5 x 10
8 cells in MME
containing  0-5 % Triton X-100 and incubating them
for lOmin on ice (Hemphill et al. 1991). For thepreparation of the flagellar fraction, cytoskeletons
were resuspended in 2 ml of
 0-1 x MME containing
1 M NaCl (Schneider, Hemphill & Seebeck, 1988).
After sonication for 15s the suspension was kept on
ice for 20 min. The cytoskeletons and the flagellar
suspension as well as the supernatant of the cyto-
skeletons were all precipitated with 4:1 methanol/chloroform (Wessel & Fliigge, 1984) to remove saltsand detergent and the final protein pellets weresolubilized in
 1 ml of sample buffer. The Western
blot analysis for the determination of the diagnostic
sensitivity of I 2 and I 17//?-galactosidase fusion pro-
teins was performed as described by Muller et al.
(1992).  Serum antibodies to /?-galactosidase and
other components of  E. coli were previously removed
by pre-adsorption of the bovine sera to a lysate ofAgtl
 1 lysogens from strain Y 1089 (Huynh, Young  &
Davis,  1985). The peroxidase-dependent colour
reaction was performed using either 3,3'-diamino-
benzidine tetrahydrochloride as described by Vogelet al. (1988) or Enhanced Chemoluminescence(ECL, Amersham) according to the manufacturer'sspecifications.
DNA
 sequencing  and hybridization
Nested deletions of DNA fragments were prepared
with exonuclease III double-stranded nested de-letion kit (Pharmacia, Sweden); subclones weredouble-strand sequenced using the Sequenase DNAsequencing kit (United States Biochemical Cor-
poration). For hybridization analysis, DNA wasblotted onto nylon filters and was hybridized in0-lxSSC (15 mM NaCl, 1-5 mM Na
3citrate), 4x
Denharts, 008% SDS, 80 mM sodium phosphatepH 6-5, 80 mg/ml herring sperm DNA at 65 °C for
14 h. The filters were washed 3 times for 10 min in
0-lxSSC, 01% SDS for 20 min at 65 °C. Bothhybridizations were done using purified inserts of
AI2 and AI 17 respectively.
Subcloning of Agtl 1 inserts
The cloning of recombinant AI 2 and AI 17 cDNA
inserts into Bluescript plasmid KS-plus (Stratagene)
was performed as described by Rindisbacher et al.
(1992).
Western blot analysis
The trypanosomal fractions used for the Westernblot analysis were prepared as follows. For whole celllysates 4-5 x 10
8 trypanosomes were washed once in
MME and then lysed in 1 ml of sample bufferImmunofluorescence
Trypanosomes were cultivated as described above.
After  3 washes in PBS, cells (approximately 107/ml)
were applied to cover-slips previously coated with
100/^g/ml polylysine and were allowed to settle for1 h in a moist chamber at room temperature. Cover-
slips were then rinsed twice in MME and treatedwith 2% formaldehyde in MME for 15 min. Thefixed trypanosomes were permeabilized in methanolat
 — 20  °C for 10 min and subsequently rehydrated
in PBS for 30 min. For the preparation of cyto-
skeletons, cells were extracted on the cover-slipswith MME containing 0-5 % Triton X-100 for
 5 min

at room temperature prior to fixation. After rehy-
dration, cover-slips were incubated for  1 h in
blocking buffer (PBS containing 100 mM L-lysine
and 1 % BSA). For immunostaining, cover-slips were
incubated for 45 min in a moist chamber at room
temperature with affinity-purified antibody diluted
1:10 in blocking solution. After washing the cover-
slips 6 times in PBS, FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-
rat Ig (Dakopatts, Denmark; diluted 1:100 in
blocking solution) was applied as described for theaffinity-purified antibodies. After removing excesssecond antibody by washing 6 times in PBS, cover-slips were mounted on a slide using a mixture ofgelvatol/glycerol in PBS as embedding medium
(Lawson, 1983).
Immunogold electron microscopy
Washed trypanosomes were allowed to settle onto a
Formvar carbon-coated grid for  1 h prior to ex-
traction in MME containing 0-5% Triton X-100 asdescribed above. After rinsing the cover-slips in
MME, the cytoskeletons were fixed in 3-7 % para-
formaldehyde in MME, incubated in blocking bufferand exposed to the antibodies as described forimmunofluorescence, with the modification that thesecond antibody was an affinity-purified goat anti-rat
IgG coupled to 10 nm colloidal gold (Janssen,
Beerse, Belgium), diluted 1:5 in 20 mM Tris-HCl,pH 82, containing
 1 % BSA. After washing the grids
6 times for 5 min in PBS, they were fixed with 2%
glutaraldehyde in PBS for 20 min. Grids were thenwashed 6 times in H
2O, and negative staining was
carried out in 3 changes of  1 % uranyl acetate, 20 s
each. Finally, grids were air-dried and electron
micrographs were taken with a Philips EM 300microscope operating at 60 kV.
RESULTS
High molecular weight proteins associated with the
cytoskeleton are antigens
When whole trypanosome extracts were anlaysed by
immunostaining with infected bovine serum, a
discrete banding pattern was observed (Fig.  1 A).
Several distinct bands could be discerned in the30—100 kDa region, and heavy staining was observed
in the high molecular weight range, in agreement
with earlier observations (Miiller et al. 1992).
Unexpectedly, the staining patterns obtained with
whole cell lysates (Lane 1) and with purifiedcytoskeletons (Lane 2) were very similar, indicatingthat antibodies in the infected serum are mainlydirected against cytoskeletal components. This no-tion is further supported by the observation that aqualitatively similar staining pattern was also ob-tained with hyperimmune rat serum raised againsttrypanosomal cytoskeletons (Fig.
 1 B).200-

In order to select antibodies with specificity
against high molecular weight (HMW) proteins, the
> 180 kDa region of gel-fractionated whole trypano-
some extracts was used for affinity purification of
antibody from hyperimmune anti-cytoskeletonserum. Immunofluorescence microscopy shows thathyperimmune serum against cytoskeletons reactswith almost the entire cell (Fig.
 2 A)  whereas affinity-
purified HMW-specific antibodies predominantlystain the flagellum (Fig. 2B).
Results presented in Figs 1 and 2 indicate that
most of the host antibodies formed in the first 2
weeks of infection react with components of the
cytoskeleton. Furthermore, many of the antibodies
which are specific for HMW proteins react with
components of the flagellum, suggesting that theflagellum is a source of strongly immunogenicantigens of high molecular weight.

(A) Deduced amino acid sequence from  the AI 2 cDNA
sequence. Between amino acids  90 and 428 the  sequence
consists  of seven  and a  half highly conserved repeat
units  of 45 amino acids.  One  amino acid  can be  either
alanine  or threonine.  (B) Amino acid sequence deduced
from the AI 17 cDNA sequence.  The  sequence consists
of 14 highly conserved repeat units  of either  29 or 28
amino acids.  The  first amino acid (leucine)  of the  given
sequence does  not belong  to the  repeat.  At 2  positions
within  the repeat amino acid exchanges occur: from
valine  to alanine,  and  from glutamine  to leucine  or to
valine plus alanine  or to  alanine plus alanine.  The C-
terminus  of I 17 consists  of 13 unrepeated amino acids.
In both panels, identical amino acids  are indicated with
a period  and  in-frame stops  are marked  by asterisks.
The sequences have been deposited  in the
GenBank/EMBL data library under  the accession
numbers Z36280  (I2) and  Z36281  (I17).
Screening of a T. b. gambiense  expression  library

In order to identify genes for such HMW flagellar
antigens, a Agtl  1 library of bloodstream T. b.
gambiense  (Barnes et al. 1989) was screened with the
anti-HMW protein antibody. The phages recovered
from this screening represented a number of dif-ferent genes, two of them, I

I2 and / 17 both show repetitive sequence motifs
The inserts of recombinant AI 2 and AI 17 were
subcloned into Bluescript plasmid KS-plus and weresequenced as described in the Materials and Methodssection. The analysed fragment of I
2 has a length of
2004 bp. Its sequence has an in-frame stop codon at
position 1518, followed by an untranslated stretchand a poly-A tail (not shown). This suggests that thecloned cDNA fragment of I
2 represents the C-
terminus of the I, gene. A 1017 bp stretch of thetranslated part (Fig.

conserved 135 bp repeat. Only a single amino acidposition of the repeat is not fully conserved andcontains either alanine or threonine. The 3' end ofthe coding sequence (300 bp) is not repetitive. Theanalysed fragment of I
17 has a length of 1539 bp. The
sequence has an in-frame stop codon at position

1233,  followed  by  about  300 bp of  untranslated
region  and a  poly-A tail, which again indicates that
the sequenced fragment represents  the  C-terminal
part of the I17 gene.  The  derived amino acid sequence
of I17 is shown  in Fig. 3B.  Most  of the I 17 sequence
(1179  pb)  consists  of a  highly conserved repeat  of
87 bp with only  3 positions  not fully conserved.  The
C-terminus  of I 17 is formed  by a  short stretch  (14
amino acids)  of non-repetitive sequence. Database
searching with both  the I 2 and I 17 amino acid
sequences revealed  no similarity with  any  known
sequences.
Genomic organization  of the I 2 and / 17 gene
The cDNA sequence of I 2 and I 17 showed that both
genes are internally repetitive. The genomic organi-
zation of the genes of I 2 and I 17 was subsequently
determined by restriction mapping. Genomic DNAof T. b.  brucei  was digested with restriction enzymes
which either do or do not cut within the repeat
sequence and was analysed by Southern blotting.Hybridization of genomic digests with an I
2-specific
probe (Fig. 4A) revealed that Pst I and Bglll, whichboth cut once within the I
2 repeat, generate a
strongly hybridizing fragment, with the size of therepeat unit (135 bp). Hindi
 11, EcoRV and EcoRl
which do not cut within the repeat all generate largefragments (> 15 kDa). This observation indicatesthat I
2 consists of the conserved 135 bp repeat
throughout most of its length. The additionalfragments (1-2 kb) generated by Pst I may beindicative of occasional point mutations within the
repeat.
Similarly, hybridization with the I
17-specific probe
(Fig. 4B) gives a strong signal in the upper molecular
weight range ( > 15 kb) for enzymes which do notcut in the repeat (Hindlll,
 EcoRV,  EcoRl and Bgl

lysogens of AI 2 (A), AI 17 (B) and Agtll (C) were blotted and cut into strips. Each strip was then incubated with a
bovine serum. The sera originated from cyclical infections by  Trypanosoma  vivax (Lanes 2-4), T.  congolense  (Lanes
5-8), T. b.  brucei  (Lanes 1, 9, 10), or from mixed infections by T. b.  brucei/T.  vivax (Lanes 11-13) or T. b.  brucei/T.

incubated with two different uninfected sera.
II) whereas Pst I, which cuts once within the repeat,
generates a very strong band at about 90 bp. This
correlates well with the size of the repeat defined bysequence analysis (87 bp). The additional two faintbands correspond to dimers and trimers of the repeat
unit. This is in good agreement with the available
sequence data which show that the Pst I restrictionsite is missing in three of the 14 repeats sequenced.
In contrast to I
2, the I 17 hybridization probe does not
reveal additional bands, indicating that the whole I 17
gene has a repeated structure.
/2 and l xl are both high molecular weight proteins
The screening strategy used for gene isolation, aswell as sequence and hybridization data predict that
I
2 and I 17 both are high molecular weight proteins.
In order to confirm this prediction at the protein
level, the following Western blot analysis was
performed. Whole cells, cytoskeletons and flagella oftrypanosomes were prepared (see Materials and
Methods section) and fractionated by SDS-PAGE.
After transfer to nitrocellulose, they were probedwith affinity-purified antibodies against I
2 and I 17//?-
galactosidase fusion proteins. Both antibodies re-
vealed several distinct bands in the high molecularweight (>180kDa) region. Both proteins aredetected by immunostaining of whole cell extracts,in Triton-insoluble cytoskeletons and in salt-
extracted flagella (Fig. 5) indicating that both
proteins are tightly associated to the flagellar cyto-skeleton.
Localization of I
2 and I 17
Having established the tight association of I 2 and I 17
with the flagellar cytoskeleton, an immunofluores-
cent staining of cytoskeletons and whole cells with
affinity-purified anti-I 2 and anti-I 17 antibodies was
performed. The results of this staining are shown in
Fig. 6. Both I 2 and I 17 antibodies induce a bright
fluorescence along the flagellum. As both antibodiesstain the flagellum with a very similar pattern, amore detailed localization was required. This wasachieved by immunogold electron microscopy (Fig.
7). Antibody against I 2 reacts with the paraflagellar
rod (Schlaeppi, Deflorin & Seebeck, 1989) sug-
gesting that I 2 is a component of this structure. In
contrast, antibody against I 17 specifically stains the
interface between the paraflagellar rod and the
axoneme. While immunogold electron microscopythus confirms the biochemical and immunofluores-
cence data indicating a close association of I
2 and I 17
with the flagellum, it further demonstrates that thedetailed localization of the two proteins within theflagellum is quite distinct.

Immunodiagnostic potential of I 2 and / 17
In order to evaluate the potential of I 2 and I 17 for
diagnostic purposes, the respective /9-galactosidase
fusion proteins were used to analyse, by Western
blotting, 18 sera from N'Dama and Zebu cattle with
parasitologically confirmed infections with T. b.
brucei, T.  congolense,  T. vivax, as single and as mixed
infections. Also, two uninfected sera were included as
controls. Fig. 8 demonstrates that 15/18 infectedsera reacted with I
2 and 17/18 with I 17 but none with
the /9-galactosidase control protein. All sera reacted
with at least one of the two recombinant antigens.
The serum which was taken 5 days after infection
reacted with both recombinant antigens. No re-activity was seen with the 2 control sera.
DISCUSSION
In an earlier study we identified two trypanosomal
antigens to which antibodies are produced early in aninfection, MARP1 and GM-6 (Miiller et al. 1992;
Hemphill et al. 1992), as high molecular weight
proteins both associated with the cytoskeleton. As
both of them exhibited a high immunodiagnostic
sensitivity (90%), we wanted to know if Africantrypanosomes contain such additional cytoskeletal
antigens. Therefore we have designed a screening
protocol for the identification of these antigens. Thepresent study described two antigens isolated by this
strategy, I
2 and I 17. Both are high molecular weight
proteins (MW > 180 kDa), both are highly intern-
ally repetitive and consist predominantly of con-
served repeat units of 45 and 29 amino acids,respectively. Thus I
2 and I 17 share several important
features with GM6 and  MARP1,  but all 4 proteins
show neither amino acid sequence similarity nor
immunological cross-reactivity (data not shown). I 2
and I 17 are both located in the flagellum, though at
different locations within this structure. The data
presented in Fig. 8 indicate that I 2 and I 17 might be
of diagnostic interest in that they represent proteinswhich (i) are strongly immunogenic already in the
early phase of infection, (ii) elicit an appreciable
antibody response in all infected hosts, and (iii) are
highly conserved between the African trypano-
somatids (T. brucei, T.
 congolense  or T. vivax).
The finding that these trypanosome antigens are
highly repetitive is in line with what we already have
described for two other early antigens, MARP-1 and
GM6 (Muller et al. 1992, 1993). These observations
contribute to the emerging overall picture that the
host antibody response both in the African trypano-
somiases as well as in South American Chagas diseaseis strongly directed against parasite proteins which
have the common denominators of being (i) very
large and (ii) highly internally repetitive with a veryhigh degree of sequence conservation between the
individual repeat units (Ibanez et
 al. 1988; Hoft et al.1989;  Lafaille et  al. 1989; Duncan, Gay  & Donelson,
1991;  Pollevick et al. 1991; Burns et al. 1993). In
addition, all these antigenic proteins are intracellular
proteins, with the exception of SAPA, which is a
GPI-anchored surface protein (Pollevick  et al. 1991).
Several aspects of the molecular characteristics of
these antigens are noteworthy. Already the mere factthat proteins consist of so many so well-conserved
repeat units is peculiar. Highly repetitive proteins
are not common in biology, and where they exist,e.g. spectrin in the erythrocyte, they exhibit a large
extent of sequence variation between individual
repeat units (Alcina et al. 1988). Conceptually, an
internally repetitive organization of a protein might
have evolved because the protein in question inter-
acts with a repetitive substrate and is under evol-
utionary pressure to form many identical interactions
with the substrate. This line of argument would beparticularly cogent for
 MARP-1,  which was orig-
inally identified as a microtubule-associated protein
of trypanosomes (Schneider et  al. 1988; Hemphill et
al. 1992) and thus interacts with a lattice of regularly
spaced tubulin dimers. However, although similar
pressures should exist in other organisms, nocomparable degree of repetitiveness is found else-
where. Many microtubule-associated proteins from
different organisms have been characterized and,
where repetitive domains have been found, theyconsist of a small number of not very highly
conserved repeat units (Lewis, Wang & Cowan,
1988).
These findings argue that it is not the biological
function of the various internal trypanosome anti-
gens which exert the pressure to build up highly
repetitive proteins and to maintain the observed
near-perfect sequence conservation. So what does  ?
Is it conceivable that the high molecular weight
repetitive proteins have been generated by the
trypanosome as devices for liberating, upon cell
destruction by host defence mechanisms, large
amounts of identical, immunologically active pep-
tides which stimulate the immune system? Sincemany of the infecting trypanosomes are invariably
destroyed at the site of an infection, this concept
would guarantee a rapid and effective stimulation of
the host's immune system, some parts of whichmight be beneficial for the parasite. The concomitant
stimulation of antibodies against the peptides would
be of no consequence to the trypansome because thetarget proteins are safely sheltered inside the cell. A
similar situation is the strong stimulation of the
host's immune response by the variant surface coat
(VSG) which is the most prominent external antigen
of the trypanosome (Cross, 1990). Here a different
VSG-type population of parasites is already growingwhen the response against the former one is fully
raised. Thus the parasite, after having stimulated aresponse against
 itself,  can survive without any
disadvantage.

While we clearly need to learn much more about
the possible roles of these repetitive proteins in the
course of an infection, the available data demonstrate
that they could play a most useful role, in a morepractical sense, as diagnostic reagents.
