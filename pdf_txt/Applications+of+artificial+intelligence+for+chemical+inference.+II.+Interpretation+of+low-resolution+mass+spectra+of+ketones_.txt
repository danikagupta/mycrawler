Abstract: Ageneral approach tocomputer interpretation ofthemass spectra ofaliphatic ketones isdescribed.Given thelow-resolution mass spectrum plusthecomposition ofthemolecular ion,thecomputer program decidesupon themost probable structure(s) consistent with theunknown's mass spectrum. Theprogram makes extensiveuseolthedendral algorithm. l
Theapplication ofdigital computers todatareduction problems inboth high-3"6and low-resolution7mass spectrometry has automated theaccumulation ofexperimental information, especiallyinthose instances where agaschromatograph isdirectly
interfaced with amass spectrometer.7Interpretingthisvast amount ofdata isaformidable problem fortheresearch worker. Itssolution may ultimately
reside intheability ofsuitably programmed computerstopresent adetailed interpretation ofany massspectrum. Preliminary results from other lab-oratories8-11have described methods whereby acom-
puter participates intheinterpretation ofhigh- 8-10
andlow-resolution >xmass spectra. Inaddition, specificprograms have been written forthedetermination oftheammo acid sequence insmall peptides from acom-puter interpretation oftheir high-resolution mass
spectra. 12-14

Wewish todescribe inthepresent communication ageneral approach directed toward the complete
computer interpretation oflow-resolution mass
spectra.16Ourapproach isbased onthecapability ofacomputer program (dendral)17tomanipulate struc-tural representations oforganic molecules and theirfunctional groups andtogenerate rigorously exhaustiveand irredundant lists ofstructures including thecandidates foragiven problem. lBAsfarasweknow,
thisgeneral capability hasnotbeen embodied inotherwork attacking thisproblem. Aliphatic ketones werechosen asasuitable class ofcompounds with which tobegin acomputer interpretation ofmass spectra inview ofthefundamental knowledge available ontheir
mass spectrometric fragmentation modes.19
Thebasic approach wehave used inthecomputerinterpretation ofmass spectra isdiagramatically
represented inScheme I.The dendral program can
enumerate allthepossible acyclic chemical structures1'
1Sofagiven empirical formula. Theprogram isfedalow-resolution mass spectrum of anunknowncompound (including any metastable transitions
observed) andtheempirical composition ofthemolec-ularion.20Itthen employs atheory ofmass spectralfragmentation processes,19stored inthe preliminary
inference maker,21todecide what functional groups
are present within themolecular structure oftheunknown. The program now gives the inferred

(16)Although theprogram iscurrently restricted totheutilization oflow-resolution mass spectra, nobasic problems areanticipated inthefuture useoftheir complete high-resolution counterparts.

anabbreviated low-resolution mass spectrum foreach

which show such inconsistencies are eliminated;
