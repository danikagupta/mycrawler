2 ABSTRACT
Efficient nutrient removal from mixed black water is under challenge in the context of global pollution control 
and circular economy. The anaerobic-anorexic-aerobic process is a widely used biological nutrient removal 
technology for wastewater treatment, yet its denitrification capacity is limited by the low biodegradable organics to nitrogen (C/N) ratio due to prior degradation of mixed black water. We have previously proved that weak 
electrical of 0.2 V could stimulate microbial denitrification of black water using an external electrical supply to 
ensure voltage stability. To reduce the dependence on additional electrical and to ensure a stable voltage output, we built a microbial fuel cell (MFC) and a microbial electrolytic cell (MEC) embedded in the anaerobic-two stage anoxic/aerobic (A-(A/O)
2) system in this study, where the MFC degrades organic matter and generates electricity 
first. Then, the electroactive bacteria in the MEC catalyze denitrification at low carbon levels, which is affected by microbial ultra-low weak electrical stimulation (MUlWES) generated by MFC. Results showed that the removal rates of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were up to 91.3% and 98.3% respectively at a 
stimulation voltage of 0.1 V. Fluorescence spectroscopy revealed the formation of aromatic proteins and an 
increase in tightly bound-extracellular polymeric substances (TB-EPS), suggesting the involvement of these compounds in electron transfer. Community analysis disclosed the activation of autotrophic denitrifying bacteria 
and the inhibition of most heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria.   
1.Introduction
Mixed black water refers to effluents from septic tanks which con -
tains feces, urine and flushing water [36]. Treatment of mixed black 
water is challenging because it is difficult to separate feces and urine 
from the flushing water while excessive loads of flushing water increases 
the cost of transportation and treatment of the wastewater [16]. More -
over, human feces contain high concentrations of organic pollutants and pathogenic microorganisms, which causes water pollution and disease transmission [15]. Simultaneous control of organic pollutants and 
pathogenic microorganisms in the mixed black water is generally complicated and expensive [40]. According to statistics, the emission of 
black water from toilets in China amounts to 1.44 × 10
7 tons daily. On 
average, 1 ton of black water from toilets can pollute 220 tons of clean 
water with valuable substances such as nitrogen and phosphorus [23]. 
Therefore, advanced technologies treating mixed black water while recovering resources from it are necessary in the context of the circular 
economy [20].

1 Song Qin and Hongbo Liu contribute equally to this work.https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2022.134615 The modified anaerobic-anoxic-aerobic processes (A2/O) are
commonly used to treat mixed blackwater [4,26,28,58]. For example, 
the process is inverted to avoid the adverse effect of return nitrate on 
anaerobic phosphorus release and the two-stage anoxic-aerobic process 
is extended with longer hydraulic retention time to enhance the treat -
ment of blackwater. But denitrification efficiency is usually limited due to the prior degradation of carbon microbial nutrients in the septic tank, 
the unstable microbial diversity and the activity of phosphorus-releasing 
bacteria competing for carbon sources [38,48]. Moreover, when the 
hydraulic load is insufficient, phosphorus removal will be reduced because aeration reduces the PHB content in phosphate-accumulating 
organisms (PAOs) cells, resulting in a decrease in phosphorus uptake, 
which prevents PAOs absorbing extracellular phosphate to synthesize 
polyphosphate effectively [3]. The efficiency can be improved by the 
embedding of a biological electrochemical system (BES), in which an 
electrochemical reaction is driven by active microorganisms located at 
the surface of electrodes [2,7,14,29,53]. For instance, electricity- 
producing microorganisms such as Geobacter, Shewanella, Proteobac
-
teria, and Bacteroidetes are attached to the anode of MFC and produce 
extracellular polymers (EPS) as electron acceptors to maintain their survival [43]. The generated EPS could then form biofilms to degrade 
substrate in sewage and generate electrons that can be further used for 
the reduction processes [21]. For example, electrons reach the cathode 
via the external circuit to reduce NO
2– or NO 3– electron acceptors, thus 
reducing the competition for carbon sources between phosphorus- 
releasing bacteria and denitrifying bacteria (including autotrophic denitrifying bacteria and heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria) and 
improving the efficiency of nutrient removal [39,59]. 
Previous studies coupling microbial fuel cells (MFCs) with conven
-
tional wastewater treatment processes such as wetland and upflow 
anaerobic sludge tanks have shown that the combined processes achieve 
significant sludge reduction due to the small fraction of COD (chemical 
oxygen demand) used for microbial growth compared to conventional 
processes, but are limited by their low power supply efficiency and 
pollutants removal efficiency [37,63]. Many scholars are currently 
treating black water and generating microbial electricity simultaneously 
with MFCs, but the N removal is not significant [2,7,14]. Therefore, we 
hypothesized that a stepwise system combining both MFC and microbial 
electrolytic cell (MEC) with anoxic–oxic compartments would enhance 
sludge reduction and denitrification and avoid the competition between 
autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria. As a first trial to 
stimulate microbial denitrification in mixed black water treatment, we 
used a direct current (DC) supply to provide 0.2 V of power to the MEC 
unit to supplement the unstable power production and low output 
voltage of the MFC unit [32]. Later potassium persulfate is also dosed as 
cathodic solution to improve the electrochemical activity of the MFC and to ensure the stable supply of ideal power to the MEC [24]. How
-
ever, these modifications directly or indirectly increase processing costs. Ideally, the applied current intensity should not be too strong to avoid 
inhibiting microorganisms and denitrification [64]. 
Actually, most investigations have studied electrical stimulation at 
voltages of 0.1–1.5 V [22,33,49], whereas little is known about the ef
-
fects of microbial ultra-low weak electrical stimulation (MUlWES) 
(0–0.1 V). Therefore, to reduce the dependence on additional electrical 
providing and to ensure a stable voltage output, this study built a mi -
crobial fuel cell (MFC) and a microbial electrolytic cell (MEC) embedded 
in the anaerobic-two stage anoxic/aerobic (A-(A/O)2) system, where the 
MFC degrades organic matter and generates electricity first. Then, the electroactive bacteria is enhanced by MUlWES generated by MFC and 
then catalyzes denitrification at low C/N levels in the MEC unit. To the 
best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the role of 
MUlWES (0–0.1 V) in the coupled A-(A/O)
2-MFC-MEC process. 
In this study a novel A-(A/O)2-MFC-MEC system to remove N (ni -
trogen), P (phosphorus) and COD from mixed black water using MFC 
voltages at 0, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07 and 0.1 V was studied. Extracellular 
polymers (EPS) and changes in the abundance and structure of microbial populations were also examined. When the A-(A/O)2-MFC-MEC process 
is applied to actual projects in the future, it can largely reduce the 
dosage of external organics and the excess electricity generated can be 
used to enhance performances of biological treatment units to achieve 
the economic and social benefits by saving energy consumption and 
reducing carbon emissions. 
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Experimental setup
The diagram of the experimental device and process flow chart is 
demonstrated in Fig. 1. Anaerobic tank 1, Anoxic tank 1, Aerobic tank 1, 
Anoxic tank 2, and Aerobic tank 2 in the A-(A/O)2 process are denoted as 
Anaerobic 1, Anoxic 1, Oxic 1, Anoxic 2, and Oxic 2, respectively. Both 
the experimental group (EG) and the control check (CK) use reactors 
with nearly identical conditions, except that the CK is not equipped with 
MFC and MEC. The EG is composed of an anaerobic zone, two anoxic 
zones, two oxic zones and a sedimentation tank. The Anaerobic 1 is 
coupled with an MFC, and the Anoxic 2 is coupled with an MEC to 
achieve better black water treatment efficiency. The reactors are made 
of plexiglass with the thickness of 5 mm. The length, width, and height 
of each chamber are 22 cm, 15 cm, and 10 cm, respectively, and the total 
volume is 12 L. The first anoxic tank is separated by a porous plate in the 
middle, and the left compartment (Anaerobic 1) builds the MFC, which 
serves as power supply for the MEC. The right compartment (Anoxic 1) 
receives the internal return flow from Oxic 1. Anaerobic 1 is equipped 
with a 5 ×8 cm wire mesh, a 5 ×6 ×10 cm carbon brush, and an 
external 5000 Ω resistor is used in the MEC with an electrode distance of 
4 cm. The electrode is fixed on the top partition of the reactor by a ti -
tanium wire, and the two ends of the resistance wire are connected to two ends of the electrode by a titanium wire mesh. Anaerobic 1 and 
Anoxic 1 have outlets in the middle and upper parts, with sampling 
points and mixed liquid suspended solid (MLSS) return points on the top. 
The cathode and anode electrodes of the MEC are made of 5 ×8 cm steel 
wire mesh and 5 ×8 cm carbon felt, respectively. The electrode distance 
is 4 cm. The electrode is fixed on the separator on the upper side of the 
reactor by titanium wire. 
The MFC electrode voltage IT8800 series DC electronic load control 
was used to collect voltage data every 30 s. The biomass sludge was 
magnetically stirred in the anoxic tank and anaerobic tank at a speed of 
300 rpm. Oxygenation disks were placed at the bottom of the oxic tanks. 
2.2. Wastewater quality and sludge inoculation 
Real mixed black water samples were taken from the septic tank of a 
teaching building in University of Shanghai for Science and Technology 
(old campus at East Guoshun Road). Quality of the actual mixed black 
water is determined each week since year 2015. Artificial wastewater 
was used to simulate the mixed black water and used as the influent for 
the laboratory scale A-(A/O)
2-MFC-MEC reactors. The approximate 
composition of artificial wastewater is in mg/L: COD 1050–1150, ammonia nitrogen (NH
4-N) 50–60, total nitrogen (TN) 50–60, and 
phosphate (PO 43--P) 10–12. Detailed composition of the artificial 
nutrient solution, and composition of trace elements in the stock solu -
tion are shown in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2. Nutrient solution and a weak acid buffer reagent were included in the artificial water to 
keep the pH of the artificial water distribution between 7.0 and 8.0. 
The sludge inoculated was taken from the Eastern District Sewage 
Treatment Plant of Yangpu District, Shanghai, China. The sludge was 
cultivated and domesticated into aerobic sludge and anaerobic sludge under corresponding conditions, then inoculated in the aeration tank 
and anaerobic tank, respectively. Sludge concentration in the system 
was 3100 ±100 mg/L. 2.3. Pre-treatments of the electrodes and system parameter optimization 
The 5 cm ×8 cm carbon felt electrode from Jingzhou Haote New 
Material Co., Ltd was washed with deionized water, soaked 1 h in 1 M 
NaOH, washed with deionized water, dried in an oven at 50℃ for 12 h, 
soaked in 1 M HCl for 1 h, and rinsed with deionized water before drying. The 5 ×6 ×10 cm carbon brush electrode from Jingzhou Haote 
New Material Co., Ltd, was firstly washed with deionized water and soaked for 24 h in acetone, after that it was burnt at 400℃~600℃ in a 
muffle furnace for 30 min and rinsed in deionized water and finally dried at 50 
•C. The operation parameters of the A-(A/O)2-MFC-MEC system 
were sequentially optimized, including the optimization of single and double chamber MFCs, the internal reflux ratio (100%, 200%, 300%), 
and the hydraulic retention time (12 h, 24 h, 36 h). 
2.4. Analytical methods 
2.4.1. Determination of conventional water quality indicators 
TN, NH
4-N, nitrate (NO 3–-N), nitrite (NO 2–-N), total phosphorus 
(TP), COD and pH were measured according to the standard methods 
[1]. Pollutants removal efficiencies were calculated as follows: 
R C 0 C1EC 0×100% (1)  
where C 0 is the influent pollutant concentration (mg/L), C 1 denotes the 
effluent pollutant concentration (mg/L), and R depicts the removal 
efficiency. 
2.4.2. Extraction and determination of extracellular polymer substances 
EPS of the sludge is extracted by the thermal extraction method [5]. 
Typically, 40 mL of post-experimental sludge is centrifuged for 5 min at 
4000 rpm, and the supernatant is discarded. The precipitate is washed 
twice with 0.01 M phosphate buffered solution at pH 7.4 then centri -
fuged. 15 mL of 0.05% NaCl and 40 mL of 70 •C-preheated 0.05% NaCl 
solution are then added to the precipitate to obtain a suspension at about 
50℃. After centrifugation under a reciprocating shaker for 5 min at 
4000 rpm, the organic matter in the supernatant is separated and 
considered as a solution of loosely bound (LB)-EPS. 0.05% NaCl is added 
to the sludge centrifuge tube to make up the volume to 40 mL. The tube is water-bathed at 60 •C for 30 min, then centrifuged at 4000 r/min for 
15 min, before collected and considered as a solution of tightly bound 
(TB)-EPS. LB and TB solutions are passed through a 0.45 μm filter 
membrane, then the filtrate containing purified LB and TB are analyzed by a three-dimensional fluorescence spectrometer (Hitachi, F-700, 
Japan). Parameter settings of the spectrometer are shown in Supple
-
mentary Table S3. 
2.4.3. Microbial community analysis 
5–10 g of sludge samples from the carbon felt electrode in the MEC 
(anoxic tank) were taken for static precipitation and put into a sterile 
centrifuge tube of 10 mL for microbial community analysis when the 
process performance is stable. The genomic DNA of the samples were 
triply extracted using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, and then 
mixed to establish the amplicon libraries of bacteria. An appropriate 
amount of sample DNA is added to the centrifuge tube, and the sample is 
then diluted to 1 ng/ μL with sterile water. The diluted genomic DNA is 
used as a template with specific primers 515F (5 ’ -GTG CCA GCM GCC 
GCG G-3 ’) and 806R (5 ’ -GGACTA CHV GGG TWT CTA AT-3 ’) in the 
Barcode, Phusion® High-Fidelity Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) 
Master Mix with GC Buffer of New England Biolabs. High-efficiency and 
high-fidelity enzymes are used to ensure the efficiency and accuracy of 
amplification based on the sequencing area. The Uparse software is used 
to cluster all clean reads of samples. By default, the sequences are 
clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with 97% consis -
tency. At the same time, according to the algorithm principle, the sequence with the highest OTUs frequency was selected as the repre
-
sentative sequence of OTUs. The Alpha diversity reflect the richness and diversity of the microbial community within the sample. Illumina 
sequencing data was submitted to the NCBI, under the study accession 
number PRJNA783741, and can be viewed by the following URL:

3. Results and 
discussion
3.1. Pollutants removal from mixed black water
We studied the removal of COD, N, and P in a new process 
Fig. 1. a) Anaerobic-two-stage anoxic/aerobic (A-(A/O)2) reactors equiped with a microbial fuel cell (MFC) in the Anaerobic 1 compartment, and a microbial 
electrolysis cell (MEC) in the Anoxic 2 compartment, and (b) Control check (CK) without MFC and MEC. The electricity generated in the MFC powers the MEC to

the MFC. showing 76% of TN removal [32]. Overall, it is found that the effluent 
quality of the mixed black water after the MUlWES treatment was better 
than standard discharging limits[45]. 
Xie et al.[55]studied the MFC-Anaerobic-Anoxic-Aerobic reactor and 
found that the microbial community structure changed along the di -
rection of water flow. Therefore, studying the changes of pollutants and microorganisms in the A-(A/O)
2-MFC-MEC system along the water flow 
direction and influencing factors under the stimulation of weak voltage 
is of great significance to understand the processing mechanism of the 
coupled system. 
Concentrations of COD, TP, NH 4-N and TN at each step of the 
treatment chain are shown in Fig. 3 (All MUlWES data are shown in 
supplementary Fig. S7). Results showed that COD removal was pre -
dominant during Anaerobic 1 and Anoxic 1 steps. This is explained by 
the MFC that induces the growth of electricity-producing bacteria and 
decomposes organic matter into small molecules, which further feeds 
denitrifying bacteria in the Anoxic 1 [19]. The TP concentration 
decreased continuously along the flow direction. Interestingly, the TP concentration of EG both decreased significantly in Anaerobic 1 and 
Anoxic 2. In Anaerobic 1, it is mainly due to dilution by MLSS return 
flow. In addition, the intensely decomposition of organic matter by MFC 
led to an increase in pH, which was suitable for the conversion of P into 
small insoluble phosphate [57]. The decrease of TP in Anoxia 2 is caused 
by the dilution of internal reflux and the phosphorus removal by anoxic denitrification using NO
3– as electron acceptor. Furthermore, it was 
shown that there was a synthesis of poly-β-hydroxybutyrate and release 
of phosphorus at higher COD concentrations, leading to inhibition of 
“phosphorus uptake”[27]. Since the COD of CK was higher than that of 
EG, TP removal by EG was greater than CK in Anoxia 2. 
Profiles of NH 4-N and TN show similar trends. The decrease of 
NH4-N in Anaerobic 1 was mainly due to the dilution by the MLSS 
return flow, and the decrease in Anoxic 1 was mainly due to the dilution 
by the internal return flow. Surprisingly, NO 3–-N was absent and NO 2–-N 
concentration was very low in Aerobic 1. This is tentatively explained by 
Fig. 2. Total removal in mg/L and percent of the (A) chemical oxygen demand (COD) , (B) total phosphorus (TP) , (C) total nitrogen (TN) , and (D) ammonia nitrogen 
(NH 4–N) in A-(A/O)2 system equipped with a MFC providing microbial ultra-low weak electrical stimulation (MUlWES) to a MEC. CK: control without MFC and 
MEC. Voltage refers to voltage applied to the MEC. comprising A-(A/O)2 reactors  equipped with  a MFC  providing electricity 
to a MEC (Fig. 1). To accelerate the electron transfer efficiency and 
improve the carbon source utilization efficiency, this study firstly opti-
mized the parameters and results which indicated that the best config-
uration and parameters for further experiments were single-chamber 
MFC, 200% for internal return ratio, 25% for external return ratio, and 
24 h for hydraulic retention time respectively (Supplementary Table 4 
and supplementary Fig. S1-Fig. S5). The stability of the MFC perfor-
mance was also confirmed by supplementary Fig. S6. 
We then studied the removal of COD, TP, TN, and NH 4-N at MEC 
voltages of 0, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, and 0.1 V by changing the external 
resistance value (Fig. 2). Results demonstrated that at EG-0 V the COD 
removal rate was only 2.23% higher than CK (Fig. 2A). The reason for 
this finding is that although the microorganisms enriched in MFC used 
organic matter to generate electricity and accelerate the removal of 
organic matter, the final effluent COD removal rate of CK was 95.87%, 
which was close to maintain the normal survival level of microorgan-
isms, so the embedding of the MFC had no significant effect on the 
enhancement of the final effluent COD [52]. Similarly, at EG-0 V, the 
COD removal efficiency was already very high up to 98.1%, thus 
increasing the stimulation voltage values did not significantly improve 
the removal efficiency. 
TP and NH 4-N removal showed similar trends. With already high 
removal rates  of 98.5% for P and 99.6% for  NH4-N at EG-0 V, P removal 
increased by 22.2% and NH 4-N removal by 7.8% versus the CK. This is 
consistent with the 48.0–67.0% removal rate of P observed using MFC 
embedded in an A/O reactor [55]. The remaining removable COD, 
NH4, and TP reach the concentration for normal survival of microor-
ganisms, so the effect of regulating voltage on the effluent concentration 
is not significant. 
The removal of TN increased sharply from the CK (80.0%) to EG-0 V 
(88.7%), then increased progressively with MUlWES MEC: 89.0% at 
0.03 V, 90.2% at 0.05 V, 90.9% at 0.07 V, and 91.3% at 0.1 V (Fig. 2C). 
This represents an improvement of 15.2% versus a previous study aerobic denitrification supported by COD reduction. 
3.2. Role of MUlWES in TN removal and EPS formation 
As indicated in Fig. 3, TN removal was mainly effective in the Anoxic 
2 reactor equipped with MEC. Here, TN, NO 2–-N, and NO 3–-N concen -
trations kept decreasing with increasing voltage values. The TN removal 
rate increased from 78.8% at 0 V to 87.6% at 0.1 V. Therefore, this study 
assumes that multiple microorganisms compete and cooperate under 
MUlWES, inducing multiple nitrogen removal mechanisms such as 
anodic ammonia oxidation, heterotrophic denitrification, autotrophic 
denitrification , and/or anaerobic ammonia oxidation, resulting in 
effective treatment of low C/N ratio wastewater [24]In addition, 
MUlWES may increase the electron transfer process which enhances the 
denitrification capacity [32]. Since Pili or pili like compounds contain -
ing microorganism is activated and its electrical conductivity is 
increased in the presence of weak electrical stimulation, the stimulation 
of weak electricity increases the amount of aromatic amino acids in EPS. Then the efficiency of electron transfer can be improved and the per -
formance of denitrification would be ultimately enhanced. Overall, findings in this study show that MUlWES induce a significant effect on 
TN removal. 
EPS had unique structures, and some have biological activity. On the 
one hand, EPS can protect microbial cell bodies. On the other hand, it 
can also be used as a carbon source for cell metabolism [41,47]. Changes 
in EPS in the denitrifying sludge of the MEC were analyzed by three- 
dimensional fluorescence (Fig. 4). Results showed the fluorescence in
-
tensity and area of the three-dimensional fluorescence spectrum LB fluorescent region (0.00 V F0.05 V F0.10 V) and the corresponding TB 
(0.00 V D0.05 V D0.10 V). As MUlWES increased, the LB/TB decreased. 
These results were consistent with the phenomenon that the sludge LB/ 
TB reduced from 0.66 to 0.62 after microcurrent stimulation reported by 
[60]. LB-EPS decreased and TB-EPS increased under weak electrical 
stimulation at 0.2 V, but the total amount of LB-EPS and TB-EPS proteins 
changed very little [10]. The LB-EPS located in the outer layer of 
granules extends from the TB-EPS with a highly porous and dispersible

MFC providing MUlWES to a MEC. CK: control without MFC and MEC. Voltage refers to voltage applied to the MEC. structure while the TB-EPS located in the core region of the granules are 
highly compact and rigid [60]. Therefore, this study speculate that the 
metabolic activity of microorganisms increases at 0.1 V MUIWES could result in the possible conversion of LB-EPS that is too far from microbial 
cells for metal-like electron transfer, to TB-EPS that is more tightly 
bound to cells[56]. This ultimately enhances the electron transfer be
-
tween microbial cells. 
According to the division of fluorescence spectra, regions I and II are 
representing mainly aromatic protein substances, and their content in -
creases with increasing voltages (Fig. 4). This is important because EPS 
are involved in electron energy transfer[25]. Since the microbial cells 
are encapsulated in EPS, and are thus not in direct contact with the 
external environment, EPS contains many microbial secretions such as 
polysaccharides, proteins, and humic substances that act as electron 
mediators [13]. These substances have semi-conductive properties, and 
in particular, play a very important role in electron transfer [34,46]. The 
main components of EPS proteins are extracellular enzymes, most of 
which are electrically active or acting as electron shuttles [12]. There -
fore, the increase of proteins observed in this study may lead to more 
extracellular enzymes involved in extracellular electron transfer. On the 
other hand, EPS proteins play an important role in cell adhesion and 
aggregation and contribute to the maintenance of sludge structure stability [35]. 
Region IV represents microbial byproducts and protein-like sub -
stances, which increases with MUlWES (Fig. 4). Protein-like substances 
include a variety of cellular chromophores that mediate electron transfer 
between fermenting bacteria and methanogens [44]. Overall, results in 
this study suggested that applying MUlWES MEC induced the conversion of LB-EPS to TB-EPS, and in turn, enhanced electron transfer and 
improved denitrification. Microbial community growth was closely 
related to sewage treatment, sludge performance, and EPS contents 
[42,54]. 
3.3. Probing the mechanism of MUlWES denitrification from a biological 
perspective 
Further structural diversity and similarity analysis of the MEC ni

trifying sludge microbial community structural is required to verify the MUlWES MEC denitrification mechanism. Table. 1 indicates the statis

similar trends along the successive treatment steps of wastewater, with a 
minimum diversity in Anaerobic 1. The Ace and Chao l indexes indicated 
that the diversity of bacterial communities gradually increased in the 
order of Anaerobic 1, Anoxic 1, Oxic 1, Anoxic 2 and Oxic 2. The high

inhibited, with increased abundance for Thaurea and the hydrogenophilic 
autotrophic denitrifying bacteria. Conversion of LB-EPS to TB-EPS enhanced electron transfer and improved the denitrification efficiency. 
The overall decrease of heterotrophic microorganisms facilitated the 
advanced treatment of low C/N wastewater. 
3.4. Denitrification pathway under function of MUlWES 
The denitrification pathway occurring in the MEC unit is shown in 
Fig. 6. It is assumed that anaerobic ammonia oxidation is not included in 
the calculations because it represents only a small percentage of the 
microbial population. As shown in Fig. 3, without MUlWES treatment, 
COD and TN were reduced by 8 mg/L and 3.14 mg/L, respectively; while elevated NO
2– and NO 3– effluents indicated lower denitrification activity 
and calculated removal of COD/TNF2.5. When 0.1 V of MUlWES was applied, COD and TN were reduced by 12.0 mg/L and 5.2 mg/L, 
respectively. The low accumulation of NO
3– and NO 2– indicated that the 
activity of autotrophic and/or heterotrophic denitrification was high, and the calculated COD/TN removal wasD2.5. The change in pollutant 
removal from 0 V to 0.1 V MUlWES was elucidated from the electron 
donor/electron acceptor perspective. For the electron donor, the 
reduced 4 mg/L COD produced 0.5 mmol electron (e
-) and the reduced 
0.28 mg/L NH 4produced 0.12 mmol e- via the anodic ammonia 
oxidation pathway [31]. For electron demand, the 1.26 mg/L NO 3– 
reduction produced 0.45 mmol e- and the 0.54 mg/L NO 2– reduction 
produced 0.12 mmol e-, for a total of 0.57 mmol e- less than the number 
of electrons supplied [18]. This finding indicated that the presence of 
anaerobic ammonia oxidation to remove some of the NH 4[50]. 
Therefore, the excess 0.05 mmol e- electron donor was attributed to the 
reaction of anaerobic ammonia oxidation. Calculating anaerobic 
ammonia oxidation by the electron donor and electron acceptor equa -
tion, an additional contribution of 0.21 mg/L NH 4removal from the 
anaerobic ammonia oxidation at 0.1 V MUIWES was obtained in this 
study. The reaction generates about 0.05 mg/L of NO 3– and 0.28 mg/L of 
NO2–. The low contribution of nitrogen removal by anaerobic ammonia- 
oxidizing bacteria may be achieved by the arrival of electrons via the external circuit to the cathode, which will be reduced to N
2 with NO 3– 
and NO 2– as electron acceptors by the electroautotrophic denitrifying 
bacteria or the hydrogen autotrophic denitrifying bacteria. This results 
in a very low concentration of NO 2– as the anaerobic ammonia oxidation 
reactant. In addition, MEC anodic ammonia oxidation competes with anaerobic ammonia oxidation for the substrate NH
4. 2.86 mg/L of COD 
was required to remove 1 mg/L of NO 3– [62]. 4 mg/L of COD reduction 
was achieved at 0.1 V MUlWES compared to 0 V for heterotrophic 
denitrification, so the 4.92 mg/L of TN reduction included 3.52 mg/L of 
autotrophic denitrification. Thus, 71.5% of the increased TN removal 
was calculated as autotrophic denitrification at 0.1 V MUlWES. 
Based on the discussion above, a complicated MUlWES denitrifica -
tion pathway involving seven types of microorganisms is presented as 
follows (Fig. 6). In the anode area, the following mechanisms are 
involved: (1) Fermentation bacteria decompose the remaining glucose 
into lactic acid under anaerobic conditions. (2) Electricigens decompose lactic acid and small organic matter to produce e
- and H. At the same 
time, MUlWES increases the secretion of aromatic proteins and LB-EPS, which enhances the electron transfer effect between microbial cells. (3) 
Anodic ammonia oxidation oxidizes NH
4to NO 2– and e-. (4) Anammox 
bacteria use NH 4as an electron donor and NO 2– as an electron acceptor 
to produce N 2 and a small amount of NO 3–. At the cathode area, the 
following mechanisms may be participated: (1) the Hgains e- and 
forms H 2. (2) Hydroautotrophic denitrification bacteria use the cathode- 
generated H 2 and anode-generated Hto achieve autotrophic denitri -
fication. (3) Electroautotrophic denitrification bacteria obtains e- from 
cathode to achieve denitrification. (4) Heterotrophic denitrification bacteria uses organic matters to achieve traditional denitrification. 
Various nitrogen species formed in the micro-carbon source wastewater diversity observed in Anoxic 2 implied that MUlWES increased the mi-
crobial diversity. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on the changes of 
MEC microbial populations under different MUlWES. 
As shown in Fig. 5 (a), the relative abundance of species at the 
phylum level of the MEC microorganisms at different MUlWES was 
analyzed and it showed that the dominant species in each sample were 
ranked in the order of abundance as proteobacteria , bacteriophages , sap-
rophytes , actinomycetes , and staphylococci. There were differences in the 
structure of microbial populations at four voltages, with Proteobacteria , 
Bacteroidetes , Firmicutes , and Actinobacteria being the dominant species. 
Electro-producing and hydrogen-producing bacteria were distributed in 
the four phyla, which facilitated the degradation of organic matter by 
microorganisms in the MEC unit. Firmicutes could release hydrolase, 
transform organic matter to produce acid, and transfer electrons to the 
electrode, thus the increase of MUlWES was beneficial to the enrichment 
of Firmicutes [6]. Propionicimonas was closely related to the removal of 
phosphorus and has excellent phosphorus absorption characteristics 
[11]. From the genus level, Phaeodactylibacter , Thaurea , Lactococcus , 
Sphaerotilus , Acinetobacter , and Propionicimonas were the dominant 
strains in  the process  (Fig. 5 (b)). Two types of  denitrifying bacteria were 
included, namely the autotrophic denitrifying bacterium (e.g. Thaurea ) 
and the heterotrophic denitrifying bacterium (e.g. Sphaerotilus , Acine-
tobacter ). These were identified by combining the representative auto-
trophic/heterotrophic microorganisms from previous studies in the field 
of nitrogen removal and phosphorus removal [32,51,61] . With the in-
crease of MUlWES, the abundance of the autotrophic denitrifying bac-
terium Thaurea increased (4.1% for CK versus 17.8% for EG-0.07 V) and 
the abundance of the heterotrophic denitrifying bacterium Acinetobacter 
kept decreasing (7.4% for CK versus 0.7% for EG-0.1 V), which is similar 
to the results of our previous studies where electrical stimulation 
inhibited the heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria [32]. Interestingly, the 
heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria Sphaerotilus were increasing (4.46% 
for CK versus 11.15% for EG-0.1 V). This is because the reflux from Oxic- 
2 to Anoxic-2 brought in a small amount of dissolved oxygen to form a 
local aerobic zone, and Lactococcus synthesized lactic acid as a carbon 
source through glycolysis to facilitate the survival of Sphaerotilus (aer-
obic denitrification bacteria)  [17]. Combined with  Fig. 5(c), it was found 
that the abundance of heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria such as Otto-
wia, Gemmobacter , and Dechloromonas all decreased with increasing 
MUlWES [32,51,61] , which was consistent with the above analysis. This 
is because e- reaching the cathode are used by autotrophic denitrifying 
bacteria 
such as electrophiles to reduce NO 2– and NO 3– to N 2 [9]; Zhen 
et 
al., 2009). With the increase of MUlWES e-, the abundance of auto-
trophic 
denitrifying bacteria is promoted, thus competing with hetero-
trophic denitrifying bacteria for NO 2– and NO 3– electron acceptors [8] . 
In addition, the electricity producing bacteria degraded part of the COD, 
which reduced the carbon source required for denitrification by het-
erotrophic denitrifying bacteria. The abundance of hydrogenotrophic 
denitrifying bacteria Hydrogenophage increased with increasing 
MUlWES, and it was reported that Hydrogenophage could reduce NO 3– to 
N2 using H 2 and H [9]. When the stimulation voltage was lower than 
0.07 
V, Thaurea and Hydrogenophage abundance increased with 
increasing MUlWES. However, when  it was increasing from EG-0.07 V to 
EG-0.1 V, the relative abundance of the autotrophic denitrifying bacteria 
Thaurea decreased and the relative abundance of hydrogenophage 
increased, indicating that the two autotrophic denitrifying bacteria 
competed fiercely for e- and the contribution of hydrogenophage to 
denitrification 
increased. As shown in supplementary Fig. S8, Anaeroli-
neae were present in the MEC unit  under MUlWES. Previous studies have 
reported a reciprocal relationship between Anaerolineae and anaerobic 
ammonium oxidation bacteria, possibly surviving through the break-
down of soluble microbial products and EPS produced by anammox 
bacteria [30]. Therefore it is likely that anaerobic ammonium oxidation 
is present in this system. 
Results showed that under MUlWES, lactic acid produced by 
glycolysis of Lactobacillus as a carbon source increased the abundance of often coexist, which makes it reasonable for several types of denitrifi -
cation paths to coexist in the MEC unit. 
4.Conclusion
In this study, an A-(A/O)2-MFC-MEC system was constructed
achieving high TN and TP removal rates of 91.3% and 98.3% under 0.1 
V MUlWES. Electroautotrophic denitrification, hydrogenotrophic deni -
trification, and heterotrophic denitrification were the main pathways with the least accumulation of NO
2–-N and NH 4-N under 0.1 V 
MUlWES. With enhanced MUlWES, aromatic proteins increased and LB- EPS converted to TB-EPS, enhancing electron transfer and leading to 
increased abundance of autotrophic denitrifying bacteria and decreased 
abundance of heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria. Thus, the challenge of 
poor nitrification and denitrification performance in the A-(A/O)
2 pro-
cess treating low C/N ratio wastewater was solved. If the A-(A/O)2-MFC- 
MEC system is practically applied to low C/N ratio wastewater treat -
ment projects such as mixed blackwater in the future, MUlWES can be 
used to partly take place of carbon source feeding and DC power input, 
and the excess power generated can be used for energy-consuming 
equipment such as aeration to achieve the economic and social bene -
fits of saving energy and reducing carbon emissions.

Supplementary descriptions to the main text  13 1.1 Anode materials 14 Studies have shown that some carbon-based materials such as carbon felt, carbon brushes 15 are often used as the anode material for MFC due to good electrical conductivity, flexibility, 16 corrosion resistance, as well as a strong affinity for easier attachment of MFC-producing 17 bacteria growth. However, due to the difference in specific surface area and the gap between 18 carbon felt and carbon brush, the electron transfer efficiency and the mass transfer efficiency 19 of the substrate are different, which eventually affects the effect of electricity production. 20 Therefore, in this experiment, carbon felt and carbon brush anode materials were selected for 21 control. 22 Carbon felt (5 cm×8 cm) and carbon brush (5 cm×8 cm) were pre-treated and placed into 23 the anaerobic tank with a hydraulic retention time of 24 h, an internal reflux ratio of 200%, and 24 an external reflux ratio of 25%. After one week of stable operation, the effect of different anodes 25 on the carbon removal and denitrogenation of the first-stage A/O coupled MFC was 26 investigated. The influent COD concentration was 1050±50 mg/L, and the effluent COD of 27 carbon brush MFC and carbon felt MFC were 80±10 mg/L and 70±10 mg/L, respectively. The 28 effluent NH4+-N and TN removal rates were 71.21%, 68.64%, and 66.24%, 64.86% for carbon 29 brush MFC and carbon felt MFC, respectively. From the results, it can be seen that the 30 microorganisms all formed a stable biofilm system, and the denitrification effect of carbon 31 brush MFC was slightly better than that of carbon felt MFC because carbon brush has a larger 32 specific surface area than carbon felt, which has a higher electron transfer efficiency and is 33 more favorable for the growth of nitrifying denitrifying bacteria. The result is consistent with 34 the studies of Guo et al., 2020 and Xiang et al., 2015. The influent TP concentration was 35 10.50±0.50 mg/L and the carbon brush MFC stable effluent concentration was 0.78 mg/L with 36                                                 * Corresponding author ADD: 516, Jungong Road, 200093, Shanghai, China; Email: Liuhb@usst.edu.cn (H., Liu) Tel: +86(21)55275979; Fax: +86(21)55275979 1 Song Qin and Hongbo Liu contributed equally to this work  2 a removal rate of 92.94%, while the carbon felt MFC stable effluent concentration was 1.32 1 mg/L with a removal rate of 85.94%. The phosphorus removal was affected by the double 2 chamber structure which increased the transfer resistance of ions and protons in the solution. 3 The voltage of carbon brush MFC and carbon felt MFC changes with time. The voltage of 4 carbon brush MFC gradually increases and stabilizes at 200 mV, while the voltage of carbon 5 felt MFC gradually decreases and tends to below 100 mV, so the performance of carbon brush 6 MFC is better than that of carbon felt MFC. The carbon felt gap is small, and the 7 microorganisms on the surface of the electrode material gradually increase with the growth of 8 time, especially the growth of heterotrophic microorganisms which are not related to the 9 electricity production, resulting in the blockage of the gap between the granular materials, 10 which will impede the electron transfer between the electrodes and the mass transfer process of 11 the substrate from the main body of the solution to the electrode surface, and increase the 12 internal resistance of the MFC, thus leading to the degradation of the electricity production 13 performance of the MFC. The gap of carbon brushes is large and the increase of microbial film 14 thickness is not enough to obstruct the electron transfer and matrix mass transfer process within 15 two months of operation, so the power density of the carbon brush MFC system is high. 16  17 1.2 Single/double chamber MFC 18 The A-(A/O)2-MFC-MEC system was set up with a hydraulic retention time of 24h, an 19 external reflux ratio of 25%, and an internal reflux ratio of 200%. After one week of steady 20 operation, the effect of single and double chamber MFC on the first stage A/O nutrient removal 21 was investigated.  22 The influent concentration was 510±30 mg/L, and the effluent COD of single-chamber 23 MFC and double chamber MFC was 33 mg/L and 45 mg/L, respectively, indicating that the 24 differences in COD removal rates between single/double chamber MFC were not significant. 25 This is because most of the organic matter is used as a carbon source by the microorganisms 26 when denitrification and phosphorus removal are performed (Lu et al., 2012), and this COD 27 concentration is already the organic matter level that maintains the normal activity of the 28 microorganisms inside. 29 The influent concentration was 30.5±2 mg/L, and the effluent NH4+ of single-chamber 30 MFC and double chamber MFC was 4.5 mg/L and 8.25 mg/L, respectively, after the stable 31 operation, with removal rates of 85.25% and 72.95%. The single-chamber removal rate of TN 32 is 12.11% higher than the double chamber removal rate. Because the single-chamber structure 33 is more conducive to e- transfer, nitrification and denitrification are promoted by enhanced 34 electron and proton transfer (Wan et al., 2010). Double-chamber MFC has higher mass transfer 35 resistance limiting the free electron and proton transfer, so the denitrification effect is lower 36 than that of single-chamber MFC (Min et al., 2005). 37 The influent concentration was 5.2±0.2 mg/L, and the effluent TP of single-chamber MFC 38 and double chamber MFC was 0.72 mg/L and 0.61 mg/L, respectively, after the stable operation, 39 with removal rates of 86.15% and 88.27%, indicating that the differences in TP removal rates 40 between single/double chamber MFC were not significant. This is due to insufficient carbon 41 sources in the reactor resulting in the same amount of anaerobic phosphorus release by the 42 phosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) (Yang et al., 2006).  43  44  3 1.3 Internal reflux ratio 1 The A-(A/O)2-MFC-MEC system has a hydraulic retention time of 24 h, an external reflux 2 ratio of 25%, and a single chamber MFC providing 0.07V MUlWES to a MEC. After one week 3 of stable operation, the effect of internal reflux ratios (100%, 200%, 300%) on nutrient removal 4 from the A-(A/O)2-MFC-MEC system was investigated. The average effluent concentrations 5 of COD with internal reflux ratio of 100%, 200% and 300% were 29 mg/L, 20 mg/L and 12 6 mg/L, respectively, and the average removal rates were 97.36%, 98.18% and 98.91%, 7 respectively. With the increase of the internal reflux ratio, the internal material circulation and 8 electron transfer are accelerated and the COD removal is enhanced. 9 The average effluent concentrations of NH4+-N with internal reflux ratio of 100%, 200% 10 and 300% were 0.39 mg/L, 0.22 mg/L and 0.11 mg/L, respectively, and the average removal 11 rates were 99.3%, 99.6% and 99.8%, respectively. It can be seen that the best removal of NH4+-12 N is achieved with an internal reflux ratio of 300%. 13 The average effluent concentrations of TN with internal reflux ratio of 100%, 200% and 14 300% were 8.34 mg/L, 6.5 mg/L and 3.91 mg/L, respectively, and the average removal rates 15 were 84.84%, 88.18% and 92.89%, respectively. Therefore, the increase of the internal reflux 16 ratio reduces the TN concentration in the effluent. The internal reflux is to supply nitrate 17 nitrogen to the anoxic section to be reduced to N2 as an electron acceptor for denitrification. 18 However, an excessive internal reflux ratio can introduce excessive O2, which can disrupt the 19 anoxic environment and affect the denitrification effect of the process (Hocaoglu et al., 2010). 20 The average effluent concentrations of TN with internal reflux ratio of 100%, 200% and 21 300% were 0.43 mg/L, 0.24mg/L and 0.18 mg/L, respectively, and the average removal rates 22 were 95.9%, 97.71% and 98.29%, respectively. The effluent concentration has reached 0.50 23 mg/L or less, and the effect of phosphorus removal by internal reflux ratio is relatively small.  24  25 1.4 Hydraulic retention time 26 The removal effects of COD, TP , NH4+-N and TN were enhanced continuously when the 27 hydraulic retention time of 12h was gradually increased to 24h and 36h, but the differences 28 between 24h and 36h were not significant.  29 The average effluent concentrations of COD with hydraulic retention time of 12h, 24h and 30 36h were 29 mg/L, 20 mg/L and 12 mg/L, respectively, and the average removal rates were 31 96.82%, 98.18% and 99.09%, respectively. With the increase of hydraulic retention time, the 32 internal material circulation and electron transfer were accelerated, and the consumption of 33 organic matter was faster (Niu et al., 2018).  34 The average effluent concentrations of TP with hydraulic retention time of 12h, 24h and 35 36h were 0.73 mg/L, 0.23 mg/L and 0.25 mg/L, respectively, and the average removal rates 36 were 93.02%, 97.82% and 97.59%, respectively. The hydraulic retention time of 24h and 36h 37 were more effective, but the difference in removal efficiency was not significant. This is due to 38 the absorption of phosphorus by phosphorus-polymerizing bacteria in the aerobic zone, which 39 increases the hydraulic retention time in the aerobic zone and thus improves the removal rate 40 of phosphorus , but the phosphorus concentration in this system is not high and the efficiency 41 of phosphorus removal has reached saturation at too high a hydraulic retention time (Wang et 42 al., 2014). 43  44  4 The average removal rates of NH4+-N with hydraulic retention time of 12h, 24h and 36h 1 were 0.73 mg/L, 0.23 mg/L and 0.25 mg/L, respectively. The effect of different hydraulic 2 retention times on the removal of NH4+-N was not significant, and the concentration of NH4+-3 N had reached a very low state.  4 The average effluent concentrations of TN with hydraulic retention time of 12h, 24h and 5 36h were 8.81 mg/L, 6.5 mg/L and 5.01 mg/L, respectively, and the average removal rates were 6 83.98%, 88.18% and 90.89%, respectively. Increasing the hydraulic retention time can 7 strengthen the utilization of degradable organic carbon source and internal carbon source in the 8 wastewater by denitrifying bacteria, which can improve the overall denitrification efficiency of 9 the combined process.  10 The experimental study of anaerobic-two-stage anoxic/aerobic (A-(A/O)2) systems for 11 treating mixed black water by hydraulic retention time (12 h, 24 h, 36 h) showed that the best 12 treatment effect was achieved with a hydraulic retention time of 36 h, but when the hydraulic 13 retention was too large, the treatment capacity would be reduced and the operating cost would 14 be increased. Therefore, both operating cost and treatment effect should be considered. In order 15 to obtain the most energy-saving and high-efficiency effect, 24 h hydraulic retention time was 16 selected as the best. 17  18 2.
