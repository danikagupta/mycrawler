                  ABSTRACT                               
Introduction  
Due to their synthetic nature and complex 
chemical structure, the molecules of dyes 
remain for long periods of time in nature. 
Azo dyes constitute the largest class of 
synthetic dyes, and are characterized by 
their    typical    binding      l-N   =    N-            (Manu;Chaudhari, 2003). These recalcitrant 
compounds can cause serious environmental 
problems due to the formation of 
carcinogenic or mutagenic compounds 
(Balan, 2009; Gupta et al., 2015).  ISSN: 2319 -7706 Volume 4 Number 7 (2015) pp. 720-728

The azo dye Black B from textile industries was investigated the biodegradation 
process by Pseudomonas aeruginosa UCP1567 (clinical isolate after eliminating 
resistance to antibiotics) using a 23 factorial design. The independent variables 
were used aeration/static condition, concentrations of azo dye and inoculum size, 
on the variable response, the decolorization of the azo dye. The results showed 
higher decolorization by P. aeruginosa of 85-94.4% under static condition, 52% 
under aeration of 100 rpm and 45% at aeration of 200 rpm. The static condition 
assays were observed the pH range varied from 5.8 to 8.5, and the bioassay using 
Artemia salina showed higher mortality (> 80%) compared with control, indicating 
recalcitrance compound was formed after decolorization/biodegradation. The 
results showed that the three variables static/aeration, azo dye concentration and 
inoculum size are significant in the process of Remazol Black B removal.  In studies 
with P. aeruginosa, the colour of the black B azo dye was removed 85to 94.4%, 
respectively, after 5 days of static incubation, and the colour removal efficiencies 
were observed under microaerophilic conditions, as co-metabolism of azo dye 
degradation.

Their high solubility in water sees to it that 
azo dyes are not degraded by conventional 
sewage treatment plants (Stloz et al.,1999). 
Thus, colored wastewater containing 
reactive azo dyes has caused serious 
environmental problems, mainly because 
these compounds, when present in water are 
highly visible, since they affect the 
transparency and aesthetics of the body of 
water (Stloz et al., 2002; Strehaiano et 
al.,2004; Gupta et al., 2015 ).  
Thus, it is important to investigate microbial 
strains that have high potential for 
decolorization, by means of the reductive 
cleavage of the azo group in the molecule of 
textile dyes. In recent years, several 
researchers have demonstrated the ability of 
various microorganisms to transform azo 
compounds into colorless products as well 
as to bring about complete mineralization, 
under certain environmental conditions 
(Marinho,2010) .  
Bacteria have been cited as a promising 
application when treating textile effluents, 
due to the investment costs being five to 
twenty times lower than in some other 
chemical treatment processes, such as ozone 
or hydrogen peroxide (Saum et al. 1997; 
Pandey; Upadhyay,2010; Godlewska et al., 
2014).  
Aerobic biotransformation of azo dyes by 
fungi and bacteria has been extensively 
studied. According to Pandey e 
Upadhyay,2010 , aerobic treatment is more 
attractive as a meth od for biodegrading these 
compounds. In this process, aerobic 
reductive metabolism requires specific 
enzymes (aerobic azoredutases) that catalyze 
the reduction of the azo compound by using 
NAD-dependent ones (Abraham et 
al.,2003). The aerobic azoredutases 
(monomeric flavins) isolated from 
Pseudomonas K22 and KF46 use NADPH 
and NADH as co-factors in the reduction of various sulfur dyes (Zimmermann et al., 
1984).  
Given that the decolorization of azo dyes 
can be influenced by several factors which 
have varying degrees of importance, factor 
models have been used as an important tool 
for both conducting research and for applied 
work (Chang; Kuo,2000; Mielgo et al.,2001; 
Chen;Yao, 2000). Therefore, they should be 
regarded as significant parameters for a 
given process, in addition to which the 
interaction between them enables 
optimization processes in the decolorization 
processes to be achieved. This study set out 
to evaluate the potential for decoloring 
Remazol Black by Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
(UCP 1567) under different culture 
conditions, using a complete factorial design 
23.  
Material and Methods  
Microorganism  
Pseudomonas aeruginosa UCP 1567 was 
provided by the Culture Bank at the Center 
for Research in Environmental Sciences 
NPCIAMB, UNICAP, Recife, Brazil, 
registered with the World Federation for 
Culture Collection, WFCC and maintained 
in nutrient agar at 4ºC.  
Dye  
The azo dye used was reactive Remazol 
Black B (CI 17095) obtained from Sigma 
(Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, St. Louis, 
Missouri, USA).

(LB) (g L-1): tryptone 10g, yeast extract 5g, 
NaCl 10g, 5g of glucose added distributed in 
250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks and incubated for 
12 h at an agitation rate of 150 rpm at 37°C, 
resulting in a culture of 108 CFU/mL.   
Kinetics of decolorisation  
Then, inoculum of 1.5 and 3.75 mL were 
transferred to 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks, 
containing 50 mL of LB medium 
supplemented with glucos e, pH 7.0 ± 0.2.   
The assays were performed according to the 
factorial design 23, for 120 h at 37°C. 
Samples were taken every 24 hours to 
determine the kinetics of decolorization.   
Analytical methods   
Determining pH  
The pH of the cell-free medium was 
measured using an Orion pH meter, model 
310.  
Decolorization of Remazol Black  
The removal of the dye was measured after 
centrifugation (10,000 gx 8 min.), at a 
temperature of 28°C, by a 
spectrophotometric reading of 597 nm. To 
calculate the percentage of the 
decolorization, the following equation was 
used:

The biological assay was performed using 
the McLaughlin et al.(1995), method in 
assays 1, 2, 3 (greatest decolorization). 
About 10 brine shrimp (Artemia salina) 
larvae were transferred to flasks containing 
the test sample (decolored material) with 
different concentrations (25, 50, 75%), 
diluted in 5 mL of artificial sea water. The 
control test was conducted using only 
seawater. The tests were performed in 
triplicate. The count of dead and living 
shrimp was made after 24 h of exposure.   
Factorial  design  
In the planning matrix, the lower and upper 
levels were replaced by -1 and +1, 
respectively, which makes the values of all 
the levels at the midpoint equal to zero. The 
complete factorial design 23 to examine the 
effects and interactions of the independent 
variables: volume of the inoculum, 
concentration of the dye and agitation, on 
the response variable, percentage of 
decolorization after 120 h.  All results were 
analyzed using STATISTICA software 
version 5.0, Statsoft, USA  (Table 1).  
Results and Discussion  
Decolorization of azo dye  
The initial reaction to the decolorization of 
azo dyes is the reductive cleavage of the azo 
group. However, under anaerobic 
conditions, these reactions can be catalyzed 
by several biological systems, leading to the 
accumulation of aromatic amines 
(Amoozegar et al.,2010) .  
In recent years, several studies have reported 
some factors that can affect the removal of 
synthetic dyes in the process of microbial 
decolorization. Among them, nutritional Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2015) 4(7): 720-728   
723 
factors (carbon and nitrogen sources) and 
physical factors (temperature, agitation and 
pH, etc.) can influence the degradation of 
azo compounds (Chang; Kuo,2000; Mielgo 
et al.,2001; Marinho,2010).  
Therefore, experiments were performed with 
P. aeruginosa (UCP 1567) for 120 h using 
different combinations of the three chosen 
variables (agitation, dye concentration and 
inoculum size) as per factorial design 23. 
Thus, it was observed that the best rate of 
decolorization of the dye was obtained when 
all the independent variables were regulated 
at their lowest level (assay 1), which 
prompted a decolorization of 94% and 
suggested the cleavage of the azo dye (Table 
1).  
When the independent variables were at 
their higher level (assay 8), the rate of 
decolorization decreased noticeably to only 
38%. However, when the flasks were 
subjected to moderate agitation (100 rpm), 
the rate of decolorization was higher (52%) 
(Table.1). In the assays with greatest 
decolorization, there was an increase in pH, 
suggesting the presence of amines, arising 
from the cleavage of the dye and recognized 
by its alkalinity (Table 1). To Padmavathy et 
al.(2003), the decolorization of the reactive 
azo dyes Red RB and Reamzol Red using 
glucose as co-substrate, contributed to a 
decolorization of 91-94%. In a study of  
Lysinibacillus sp dye mixture in textile 
discoloration observed a percentage 
discoloration around 87% after 48 hours 
(Saratale et al. 2013) .  
The color of the dyes Congo red and DB 38 
was removed by up to 98% and 72%, 
respectively, by Escherichia coli under 
anaerobic conditions and no decolorization 
occurred during aerobic incubation (Isik; 
Sponza,2000 ). According to Chang et 
al.(2000), the presence of oxygen does not 
directly inhibit the azoredutase activity, this inhibition probably being an event 
dependent on microbial metabolism. 
Bromley-Challenor et al. 2003, reported that 
occasional gentle agitation promotes 
uniformity of the dye, by reducing the 
limitations of diffusion. In study by Kurode 
et al. 2011, evaluating discoloration 
parameters and physical-chemical of a dye 
mixture, using strain of Bacillus sp, there 
was the efficiency of the micro-organisms in 
removing 71% of t he coloring, in period 24h 
under optimum temperature 40 °  
Silveira et al.(2009), in a study on the 
Selection of Pseudomonas for decolorizing 
industrial textile dyes observed 
decolorization of 98% for methyl-orange 
after 48 h and 78% after 56 h, respectively, 
under anaerobic conditions. On studying the 
textile dye Acid Blue 92, they showed that 
the two strains were able to decolor 
concentrations below 30 mg L 1, with 
decolorization reaching 98% decolorization 
in P. oleovorans and 94% for P.aeruginosa . 
However, decolorization of the dye by P. 
aeruginosa decreased rapidly at a 
concentration of 70 mg/ L to 50%, while P. 
Oleovans was able to remove 90% of the 
color of the dye at a concentration of 60 mg 
L 1 and up to 76% at 90 mg L 1.  
Chang and Kuo (2000), on studying the 
decolorization of the reactive dye Red 22, 
using Escherichia coli under anoxic and 
aerobic conditions, also observed that the 
level of dissolved oxygen significantly 
inhibited the removal of color. According to 
Isik and Sponza (2003), the decolorization 
of the azo dyes Congo Red and Reactive 
Black 38 in cultures of Pseudomonas sp. 
was 100 and 83%, respectively, after five 
days of anaerobic incubation. However, 
under microaerophilic conditions, only 
decolorization of 76 and 74%, respectively, 
was observed. No decolorization occurred 
under aerobic conditions.  Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2015) 4(7): 720-728

In accordance with the Pareto diagram 
(Figure 1), it is observed that independent 
variables (inoculum size, dye concentration 
and agitation) exerted a negative effect on 
the decoloring process of the dye. However, 
only agitation showed a statistically 
significant effect, suggesting that this 
variable is a parameter of great importance 
in the  process of decolorization of Remazol 
Black by P. aeruginosa.   Toxicity   
Toxicity assays using A. salina in the 
decolored samples (assays 1, 2 and 3) were 
conducted in order to determine the acute 
toxicity of the dye after treatment with P. 
aeruginosa.      Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2015) 4(7): 720-728 
726  The results of the toxicity tests are shown in 
Figure 2. The percentage of mortality was 
compared with the control, which did not 
show any toxic substance. Among the 
samples tested, assay 1 showed the lowest 
toxicity (80%). The other assays showed 
high mortality (> 80%).   
According to Amoozegar et al.(2010), and 
Evangelista et al.(2004), the mortality 
observed may be suggested by the presence 
of SO3H groups, which often resist 
biodegradation or are only partially 
degraded.  
Thus, it was observed that degradation of the 
dye formed metabolites, which were shown 
to be toxic for A. salina. The presence of 
sulphanilic acid in the environment may 
have contributed to the  toxicity presented. 
According to Sponza and Isikil,2004, 
toxicity toxicity tests using D. magna 
showed that the non-degradable portion of 
the dye was respons ible for the toxicity.  
Determining pH  
The pH of the medium during culture tended 
to alkaline range (8.0) (Table 1). This fact 
can be explained by the production of 
intermediate metabolites (aromatic amines), 
as a result of the biodegradation of the 
compound. The pH decreased after 24h 
(5.7), tending to the alkaline range at the end 
of culture growth (8.2) The initial decrease 
in pH is explained by the accumulation of 
organic acids, resulting from the degradation 
of glucose (Ambrosio,2004). According to 
Adebayo et al.,2004 the total decolouration 
of the dye Methyl Red (5mg L-1) using a 
bacterial consortium, was observed after 24 
h at pH 7 and 8, and of only 82 and 65% at 
pH 5 and 6, respectively.  
In conclusion, under the conditions studied, 
P. aeruginosa after removal of the frequency of plasmid resistance effectively 
removes the azo dye Remazol Black in 
conditions of co-metabolism. The 
application of factorial design shows that of 
the three variables used, only one 
(agitation), seems to affect significantly the 
process of decolorization of Remazol Black 
by using P. aeruginosa .
