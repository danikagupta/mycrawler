The cloning and sequencing of the rbpagene coding for a versatile peroxidase from a novel Bjerkandera strain is hereby
reported. The 1777bp isolated fragment contained a 1698bp peroxidase-encoding gene, interrupted by 11 introns. The 367

During the latest decade, research on the lignin-
degradation ability of fungi has mainly focused ona few basidiomycetes known as white-rot fungi. The
complexity of the lignin-degradation mechanisms,
which encompass different enzymes (depending on
the fungus), has prompted isolation of novel fun-
gal strains—in attempts to ﬁnd and characterise new
enzymes, regarding reaction mechanism and substrate
preference.
A novel class of ligninolytic peroxidases, named
versatileperoxidases,withhighafﬁnityformanganese
and dyes, has been described; these enzymes can
also oxidise 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (DMP) and vera-
tryl alcohol (VA) in a manganese-independent reac-
tion (Camarero et al., 1996, 1999, 2000; Giardina
et al., 2000; Heinﬂing et al., 1998a,b,c ;Martinez,
2002; Mester and Field, 1998; Palma et al., 2000;
Ruiz-Duenasetal.,1999b,2001 ).Untilnow,however,
thoseenzymeshaveonlybeenisolatedfrom Pleurotus
ostreatus,Pleurotus eryngii ,Pleurotus pulmonarius,
Bjerkanderaadusta andBjerkandera sp.strainBOS55.
The recently sequenced enzymes MnPL1 and
MnPL2 from cultures of P. eryngii exhibit high
sequence and structural similarities with LiP from
Phanerochaete chrysosporium ; however, molecular
modelsshowaputativemanganeseinteractionsitenear
the internal propionate moiety of heme. The presence
of this binding site is essential for direct oxidation of
Mn
2+
(Ruiz-Duenas et al., 1999a ).
MnP isoenzymes, puriﬁed from P. ostreatus and
duly characterised by Giardina et al. (2000) , are able
tooxidisephenolicsubstratesbothinthepresenceand
absence of manganese, as already reported ( Giardina
et al., 2000; Heinﬂing et al., 1998b; Mester and Field,
1998) for isozymes produced by other strains of P.
ostreatus, P. pulmonarius, P. eryngii, B. adusta and
Bjerkandera sp.
The catalytic properties of versatile peroxidases
from both Pleurotus andBjerkandera spp. are simi-
lartoeachotheranddifferfromthoseofLiPandMnP;
these differences in catalytic properties, as well as in
structuralcharacteristics( Camareroetal.,1999;Ruiz-
Duenas et al., 2001 ), justify the description of such
versatile peroxidases as part of a new peroxidase
family in class II (fungal) peroxidases ( Martinez,
2002).
A fungal strain, which exhibits high decolourisa-
tion activities on poly R-478 and Remazol Brilliant
Blue R (RBBR) dyes, was collected from rotting lig-
nocellulosicmaterial;thisnovelfungalstrainwasiden-tiﬁedinourlaboratoryasbelongingtothe Bjerkandera
genusandwastentativelynamed Bjerkandera sp.strain
B33/3.Analysisofperoxidaseactivitiesintheextracel-
lular ﬂuid of said strain demonstrated the existence of
ligninperoxidase,aswellasmanganese-dependentand
manganese-independentperoxidaseactivities( Moreira
etal.,2001 ).SeveralpeakswereobtainedafterMono-
Q ion-exchange chromatography of the extracellular
ﬂuid, which were characterised by distinct enzyme
activities. One of the main peaks associated with the
dye decolourising activity exhibited also properties
characteristic of the novel class of versatile peroxi-
dases,withabilitytooxidisemanganese,aswellasVA
and DMP in a manganese-independent reaction. This
new enzyme was named RBP.
The objectives of the present study were to clone
the RBP-encoding gene and to characterise both the
enzyme and its gene-encoding structures.
Bjerkandera sp.strainB33/3wasgrowninCDBYE
medium, as described previously in detail ( Moreira et
al., 2001).
From the extracellular ﬂuid of the Bjerkandera sp.
B33/3strain,themainenzymeresponsibleforthedye
decolourisation was isolated and puriﬁed following
resolution by Mono-Q ion-exchange chromatography.
Thisenzyme,namedRBPisabletooxidisemanganese,
as well as veratryl alcohol and 2,6-dimethoxyphenol
in a manganese-independent reaction; hence, it can
be included in the new group of versatile ligninolytic
peroxidases.OxidationofDMPwasestimatedbymea-
suringtheabsorbanceat469nm(30
◦
C),duringoxida-
tion of 1mM DMP in 50mM sodium malonate buffer
(pH 3.0 and 5.0), in the presence of 1mM ethylene
diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA). Oxidation of vera-
tryl alcohol was determined by measuring absorbance
at 310nm (30
◦
C), during the oxidation of 4.0mM
veratryl alcohol in 100mM sodium tartrate buffer
(pH 3.0 and 5.0). The RBBR decolourising activity
was assayed spectrophotometrically by measuring thedecrease in absorbance at 595nm (30
◦
C). The enzy-
matic standard reaction mixture consisted of 0.05mM
RBBR and 70mM sodium tartrate buffer (pH 5.0).
The manganese(II) activity was assayed spectropho-
tometrically by measuring the decrease in absorbance
at 238nm (30
◦
C). The enzymatic standard reaction
mixture consisted of 0.1mM MnSO
4
and 100mM
sodium tartrate buffer (pH 5.0). The 2,2
/prime
-azinobis(3-
ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) diammonium
salt(ABTS)oxidisingactivitywasassayedspectropho-
tometrically by measuring the decrease in absorbance
at 420nm (25
◦
C). The enzymatic standard reaction
mixture consisted of 0.5mM ABTS and 100mM
sodiumtartratebuffer(pH5.0).Kineticconstantswere
determined for several substrates. The RBP enzyme
in stake presents high afﬁnity for (the oxidising sub-
strate)manganeseatpH5.0,with K
m
values(96 /H9262M).
Small values of K
m
for DMP oxidation in the absence
of manganese were also obtained (66 and 99 /H9262M)
depending at the pH tested, 3.0 and 5.0, respec-
tively. The smallest K
m
values were obtained were
recordedforoxidationofRBBRandABTS(2 /H9262Mfor
both);thisrealisationisconsistentwiththehypothesis
that RBP is a versatile peroxidase with high afﬁn-
ity for dye substrates, e.g. anthraquinone-derived and
high redox compounds, e.g. ABTS (which are sub-
strates usually preferred by plant peroxidases). Oxi-
dation of VA is favoured at pH 3.0, as happens with
LiP peroxidases and has an apparent K
m
value of
3400/H9262M.
Puriﬁed native protein (200 /H9262g) was N-deglyco-
sylated overnight at pH 5.5 with 80mU of endo-
glycosidase H from Roche Molecular Biochemicals
(Mannhein, Germany). SDS-PAGE of native and deg-
lycosylated proteins was performed on PhastGel
®
high-densitypolyacrylamidegels(AmershamPharma-
ciaBiotech,Uppsala,Sweden).Thegelwascalibrated
using the low molecular weight calibration kit (Amer-
sham Pharmacia Biotech) as standard.
Isoelectric focusing of puriﬁed native protein
was performed in PhastGel

describedby Shevchenkoetal.(2000) .Selectionofthe
ions analysed and adjustment of the collision energy
were made manually. Peptides were delivered to the
mass spectrometer by silica capillaries obtained from
Protana (MDS Proteomics, Odense, Denmark). The
BioLynx software (Micromass) was used for the pre-
dictionofMS/MSfragmentationpatternsfrompeptide
sequences and comparison with existing mass spec-
tra. The fragmentation data obtained were analysed
using the PepSeq sequencing software (Micromass).

Molecular modelling of the Bjerkandera sp. RBP
versatile peroxidase (devoid of signal peptide) was
performed by sequence homology using the PRO-
MODII program ( Guex and Peitsch, 1997; Peitsch,
1995, 1996 ). It was based on alignment of four fungal
peroxidases,forwhichcrystalmodelsareavailablethat
present the largest similarities at the sequence level:
LiP–H2 (Broohaven PDB entries 1QPAA: 66.35%
identityand1QPAB:66.35%identity);LiP–H8(1LLP:
64.75% identity); MnP1 (1MNP: 53.58% identity)
fromP. chrysosporium . The complete enzyme, with
its heme moiety, two calcium ions and surrounding
water molecules, was built by superposition with the
A chain of QPA peroxidase (1QPA) with the programInsightII ( Biosym Technologies, 1993a ). The geome-
try of the whole system was optimised at the molec-
ular mechanics (MM) level ( Burkert and Allinger,
1982) with Amber force ﬁeld ( Weiner and Kollman,
1981;Weineretal.,1986 )usingtheprogramDiscover
(BiosymTechnologies,1993b )onaSGIIndyworksta-
tion. A dielectric constant equal to 2 was chosen and
the threshold for convergence was selected as maxi-

)—complementary to the 3

end of the cDNA
sequence, were used in a PCR experiment pertaining
to the total genomic DNA. A 1625bp fragment was
ampliﬁed and cloned. Six different templates were
completely sequenced on both strands using internal
speciﬁc oligonucleotides as primers. The Bestﬁt pro-
gram from GCG Wisconsin package (Accelrys, San
DiegoCA,USA)clearlyidentiﬁedthecorrespondence
between the ampliﬁed fragment and the cDNA and
allowed accurate localisation of the introns: 10 short
introns interrupted the ORF encoding the mature
protein.
Since the F-peroxi primer encodes seven amino
acids beginning at the third residue of the mature
protein N-terminus, the ampliﬁed fragment was
devoid of the 5
/prime

it, the oligonucleotide Nterm2 (5

residue presence would otherwise result in oxidation
of the enzyme ( Camarero et al., 2000 ).
The sequence includes one potential N-glyco-
sylationsite(N103)accordingtotheNXS/Tconsensus,
which could account for the 5.6% N-linked carbohy-
drate.

A three-dimensional model for the mature RBP

available in Fig. 5; this molecular model includes
12/H9251-helices, named according to the cytochrome C
peroxidase nomenclature ( Finzel et al., 1984 ), viz.:

Theexperimentalisoelectricpoint(p I)of3.5issig-
niﬁcantlydifferentfromthevalue4.3derivedfromthe

describedelsewhere( Gianazza,1995 ).Theabundance
of acidic residues in the RBP amino acid sequence
Modelling of protein aceous structure(12.4% versus 4.4% of basic residues) is consistent
with such a low p I.
Therbpanucleotidesequencerevealed98%identity
with the cDNA over 1017 nucleotides. Two residues
are different between the proteins translated from the
cDNA and the rbpagene; both changes, T167 in the
cDNA to I167 in the rbpagene and L301 to S301,
respectively, are located in highly variable zones aris-
ing in fungal peroxidases. The primary structures of
several fungal peroxidases contain either threonine or
isoleucine at position 167, exactly at the beginning of
/H9251-helixF,withoutanyeffectonthesecondaryandter-
tiary structures of the protein. Furthermore, leucine or
serine are both likely to be present at position 301.
These results strongly suggest that both sequences
might encode two very similar proteins (i.e. bearing
more than 99% identity), most likely encoded by two
allelic forms of the same gene. The work discussed
hereafter relates only to the rbpagene.

in the third codon base that is likely correlated to high
gene expression, as detected during enzyme puriﬁca-
tion.RBPwasthemostabundantperoxidaseproduced

Bjerkandera sp. B33/3.
The mature RBP is preceded by a 27 amino acid-
leadersequence,characterisedbyamolecularmassof
2.9kDa. Prediction of this signal peptidase cleavage
site (Nielsen et al., 1999 ) suggests that RBP is syn-
thesisedasapreproenzyme,encompassinga22amino
acid-prepeptidefollowedb ya5aminoacid-propeptide
(GoldandAlic,1993 ).The22aminoacid-N-terminus
of the RBP signal prepeptide consists of a positively
charged region of 4 residues, following the initiation
methionineresidue(MAFKQ,withanetchargeof+1)
andofahydrophobicregionof12residues(LLTAAL-
SIALAL), followed by a neutral but polar region
of 5 residues (PFSQA). The ﬁve-residue propeptide
(AITRR) possesses a cleavage site after a dibasic site
consisting of two arginine residues; this indicates that
itsremovalmightinvolveanendoproteasebelongingto
theserineproteasefamily.Manysecretedproteinscon-
tainsimilarpropeptides,whichmightbeimportantfor
accuratecleavagebysignalpeptidases( GoldandAlic,
1993).Possiblerolesofpropeptidesinvolveproteintar-
geting, polypeptide folding or enzyme maintaining in
an inactive state during translocation. The RBP signal
peptide might thus be cleaved during transit into theendoplasmic reticulum, whereas its propeptide cleav-
ageprobablyoccursinthetrans-Golgicomplex( Gold
andAlic,1993 ).However,theactualbiologicalsignif-
icance of the propeptide remains to be elucidated.
Signal peptides are known to control the entry of
eukaryotic proteins into the secretory pathway. RBP
has all typical characteristics of a secreted protein, in
agreement with the fact that it was ﬁrst isolated in the
extracellular ﬂuid.
Onepotential N-glycosylationresidue(NMT),eight
cysteineresiduesandhemepocketresidues(R44,F47,
H48,E79,N85,H177,F194andD239)includingboth
distal and proximal histidines H48 and H177, were
detected. Potential calcium binding residues (D49,
G67,D69,S71,S178,D195,I197,I200andD202),as
well as residues involved in substrate oxidation (E37,
E41 and D183 for manganese and H83, F149, W172
and A240 for aromatic substrates) are also present
(Banci, 1997; Martinez, 2002; Ruiz-Duenas et al.,
2001). This further conﬁrms that the previously iso-
latedenzyme,aswellasthatencodedbythe rbpagene
isaversatileperoxidase( Martinez,2002;Ruiz-Duenas
et al., 2001 ), which bears the ability to oxidise both
manganese and aromatic substrates.

A previous study ( Camarero et al., 2000 ) revealed
thatseveralgroupsofgenescanbeestablished(accord-
ing to the intron positions) including genes coding for
peroxidases of the same type (MnP, LiP or VP) iso-
lated from the same genus. In fact, the MnP- and LiP-
encoding genes from P. chrysosporium exhibit very
different intron positions and this is also the case inBjerkandera sp.genes( Fig.2).Theintronpositionsin
fungal peroxidases presented in Fig. 2emphasize that
therbpageneishighlysimilartothe P.chrysosporium
LiPEH8-, LiPH8- and LiPH10-encoding genes.
In the dendogram that compares 38 sequences of
mature fungal peroxidases ( Fig. 4), theC. cinereus
enzyme appeared unrelated to the white-rot fungi per-
oxidases. The T. versicolor manganese-repressed per-
oxidase (MRP) and the G. applanatum MnP1 form
the well-separated (strongly supported by bootstrap-
ping) Group V cluster. Analysis of the G. applanatum
MnP1 sequence indicates that it might possess a long
range hypothetical electron transfer pathway begin-
ning at W172, thus revealing a new possible versatile
peroxidase.Withintheremainderofthewhite-rotper-
oxidases, the P. chrysosporium ,C. subvermispora ,P.
radiateandD.squalens MnPsareclusteredtogetherin

enzymes. The LiP clade (Group IV) is backed up by
a very weak support, with a bootstrap value of 35%,
althoughtheinternalcladesthatseparatethe Trametes
andPhanerochaete LiPs are strongly supported by 97
and100%bootstrapvalues,respectively.All Pleurotus
sp.peroxidasesincludingtheversatileperoxidases,are
clustered in Group II with L. irinaVPS1, a putative
versatile peroxidase ( Zorn et al., 2003 ). Groups II and
III are strongly supported in this dendogram, with 83
and 87% bootstrap values, respectively. Furthermore,
itispossibletodescribeaversatileperoxidasebroader
clade (VP), that includes both Groups II and III, as
already described by Martinez (2002) and which is
supportedbybootstrappingwithaslightlylowerscore
(70%).
Well-characterised versatile peroxidases appear as
two separate groups (Groups II and III); Pleurotus
versatile peroxidases appear together, whereas RBP
is associated with manganese peroxidases and other
undeﬁnedperoxidasesfrom Trametes sp.(notclustered
in Group I), such as a MnP from P. radiate .
At present, it is not possible to assess the pres-
enceofmultiplegenescodingforRBPin Bjerkandera ,
even though the differences between cDNA and DNA
sequences might indicate so.
The overall topology of such globular proteins
as peroxidases is usually characterised by polypep-
tide segments ( /H9251-helices and /H9252-strands) linked by
tight turns or bends, which are almost always on the
molecule surface. A three-dimensional model for themature protein RBP ( Fig. 5) was obtained by homol-
ogy modelling. Its main characteristics are similar to
thoseoffungalperoxidasemodels,especiallythoseof
versatile peroxidases.
Themostimportantfeatureofthemolecularmodel
is that it provides a structural basis to explain the cat-
alytic properties of RBP. Its ability to oxidize man-
ganese with high substrate afﬁnity is related to the
presence of a manganese-binding site, that enables
oxidation of this cation by the internal heme moi-
ety (Banci, 1997; Martinez, 2002; Ruiz-Duenas et al.,
2001).Thetworesidues,H83andW172,locatedonthe
protein surface could be involved in oxidation of aro-
matic substrates. It is noteworthy that three aromatic
residues(F47,F159andF165)areclosetooneanother
andcouldalsoplayaroleintheLRET( Martinez,2002;
Ruiz-Duenas et al., 2001 ).
When the predicted molecular model of RBP was
superimposedontocrystalmodelsof P.chrysosporium
peroxidases,moresimilardistancesbetweenbackbone
C
/H9251
carbons were obtained with LiP than with MnP.
Theseresultsarealsoinagreementwiththoseobtained
from the intron and sequence analysis.
Overall, our results indicate that the enzyme pro-
duced by the Bjerkandera sp. strain B33/3, of which
some biochemical and molecular characteristics were
conveyed in this communication, can be included,
together with those produced by B. adusta andPleu-
rotussp., in a new class of versatile peroxidases that
share catalytic properties with both LiP and MnP.
