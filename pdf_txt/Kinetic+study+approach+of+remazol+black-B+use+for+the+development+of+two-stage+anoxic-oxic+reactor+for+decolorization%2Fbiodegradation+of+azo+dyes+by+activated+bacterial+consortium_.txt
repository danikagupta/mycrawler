Abstract
Azo dyes are an important category of recalcitrant xenobiotics, which are difficult to degrade in cold environments. In this
study, three adapted bacteria, isolated from textile wastewater and kefir, were used for developing active consortium able to
effective decolorize Reactive Red 220 (CI RR 220) in real textile wastewater (RTW). The most suitable species were Chlorel-
la, Sphingomonas paucimobilis and Lactobacillus acidophilus. Process parameters were optimized using Response Surface
Methodology (RSM) and under the optimum conditions (e.g., inoculum size of 10 % (OD600nm =1), 100 rpm, temperature
of 25 °C, pH of 11 and time of 5 days). Using batch reactors containing 1000 ppm dye and selected microorganisms, the
maximum phenol, COD and color removal efficiencies were found to be 85%, 98 and 99%, respectively. Our results showed
that bacteria had a high decolorization capacity. UV-Visible and (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis confirmed the biodegrada-
tion and color removal of CIRR 220.
Additionally, the study of cytotoxicity and mutagenicity endpoints, before and after biodegradation of CI RR 220 in real
RTW demonstrate the detoxiﬁcation of reactive azo dye.

Graphical Abstract
Introduction
Textile wastewater discharged without proper treatment can be yet reactive, toxic and carcinogenic, and can lead to adverse envi-
ronmental impacts on ecology, agriculture, aquaculture and finally on public human health [1]. Therefore, before this complicated
wastewater typology is introduced into a public sanitation network, it must be treated. The process used in the textile business in-
cludes turning raw materials into fibers, weaving those fibers into fabrics, applying finishing methods like dyeing or printing, and
going through a number of other steps to turn those fibers into completed fabrics. These processes require a lot of energy, chemi-
cals (such dyes and transfer agents), and water [1].
Since textile wastewater (TWW) is characterised by the presence of various contaminants, including synthetic dyes, sulphates and
other salts, alkalis, surfactants, dispersing agents, and other organic compounds, which contribute to the high resulting chemical
oxygen demand (COD) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), there are several safety and health issues related to TWW. The ma-
jority of dyes used in the textile industry are diazo compounds (70% c.a.), which are distinguished by the -N=N-functional group
that links aryl or alkyl groups with an extended electronic conjugation to produce colored molecules [2].
The largest and most diverse class of synthetic dyes, azo dyes, are widely used in the textile, paper and pulp, tannery, pharmaceuti-
cal, food, and cosmetic industries [3]. Environmental pollution has been brought about by the increase in industrialization and ur-
banization, and the expanding market for textile and dyed goods is causing different colors to leak into various natural environ-
ments. In addition, because of their low ability to pass through the water's surface, these dyes can have an impact on the aquatic
biota by clogging fish gills and stunting the growth of aquatic plants. Difficulties stem from the released wastewater's high tempera-
ture, low biodegradability, variable pH, and high color [4,5]. To guarantee the exhaustion step and have a high chemical and photo-
lytic stability, the method uses enormous amounts of salts [6]. According to a number of writers, dyes have the potential to cause
serious  health  problems  for  humans  by  mutating,  being  genotoxic,  and  being  teratogenic.  These  effects  have  been  linked  to
problems with the skin, kidneys, digestive tract, brain, liver, and central nervous system [5].
Many physical and chemical methods have been proposed for the removal of dyes from wastewater, including membrane filtra-
tion, flocculation, electro-coagulation, silica gel adsorption, and flotation. Nevertheless, the majority of these techniques are costly,
time-consuming, produce contaminants, and result in dense sludge that requires additional processing. The microbial treatment
of azo dye contaminated areas has drawn increasing attention due to its eco-friendliness, reduced production of hazardous metabo-3 Journal of Environmental Pollution and Management
ScholArena | www.scholarena.com Volume 6 | Issue 1lites and sludge, and lower water consumption compared to other alternative approaches [3].
For this reason, creating efficient treatment techniques is essential to advancing water sustainability and environmental preserva-
tion. Wastewater from textile dyeing is treated using a variety of technologies and techniques [2,4], however more creative and en-
vironmentally friendly techniques are still required. According to Al-Tohamy et al. [7] biological approaches for treating dye efflu-
ents are safer, more environmentally friendly, and more promising. Other than bacteria, it has been observed that macroalgae (Cla-
dophora spp., Iridaea cordata, Chara vulgaris) and microalgae (Chlorella vulgaris, Cos-marium spp., Volvox aureus) are potential
biological possibilities for treating textile wastewater effluents at significant degrees of decolonization [2]. Chlorella sorokiniana
was found to be an effective and tolerant strain, utilizing bioaccumulation as the primary mechanism for azo dye removal [8].
Their primary criteria were their capacities for adsorption and biodegradation.
Research and development activities have extensively explored the significance and theoretical underpinnings of RSM as an effec-
tive technique for multivariate optimization through sequential experimentation, as well as the optimization through experimental
design  [9].  Numerous  scholars  have  previously  explained  the  optimization  process  utilizing  a  variety  of  RSM  methodologies
[4,10].
In this work, real textile effluent from a cotton dyeing and finishing enterprise with high concentrations (1000 ppm) of azo dye CI
RR 220 was collected in order to assess the efficacy of an algal-bacterial-probiotic culture. Using RSM, the microalgal-bacterial-pro-
biotic (Chlorella, Sphingomonas paucimobilis and Lactobacillus acidophilus) consortium's performance was assessed in terms of
color,  phenol,  and  COD  elimination.  By  comparing  metabolites  using  Fourier-transform  infrared  spectroscopy  (FTIR)  analysis
and UV-visible spectroscopy before and after treatment, the biodegradation capacity of the chosen consortia was confirmed. The
potential toxicity of the produced metabolites was further assessed using mutagenicity and phytotoxicity tests.
Materials and methods
Chemicals
In this investigation, a synthetic reactive dye (CI RR 220; Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) was utilized. Using a UV–vis
spectrophotometer, the absorbance was determined at the wavelength at which it absorbs lightest (514 nm). The remaining com-
pounds were all analytical grade and of the purest possible purity. The experimental parameters of the extraction process were de-
signed and analyzed using the response surface methodology (Minitab 14.0) [9, 11].
Bacterial Strain, Inoculum Preparation and Screening of the Dye Degrading Microorganism
As previously reported [12], the CI RR 220 degrading bacterium was isolated and screened. For seven days, the bacterial culture
that showed the fastest growth was subsequently grown in nutritive broth (NB) medium. 10ml of this inoculum was introduced to
real textile wastewater (RTW) solution that had CI RR 220 (1000ppm) and incubated at 100 rpm, temperature of 25 °C and time of
5 days. Three milliliters of the mixture were taken out at regular intervals, centrifuged, filtered, and the absorbance of the mixture
was measured at 514 nm using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The percentages of color, COD, and phenol elimination were calcu-
lated using the following formula (Equation (1), (2), and (3)).
Where Ai was the initial absorbance and Af was the final absorbance.

Chlorella, Sphingomonas paucimobilis, and Lactobacillus acidophilus, which form a consortia of microalgae-bacteria, were consis-
tently maintained on Nutrient Agar, which was prepared by combining 1g/L of bacteriological peptone 10, yeast extract (2), beef
extract 1, and agar 15. The mixture was then stored at 4 °C until needed. After pre-culturing in nutrient broth prepared as follows
(1g/L):  peptone  10,  NaCl  5,  yeast  extract  2,  and  beef  extract  1,  the  selected  microorganisms  from  stock  culture  were  used  for
biodegradation studies. The cultures were then incubated for 24 hours at 30 ± 2 °C under static conditions and neutral pH [12,13].
Optimization of Microbial CI RR 220-RTW Biodegradation
In order to investigate the region of interest of the parameters discovered by the previous study, response surface methodology (RS-
M) is typically utilized after a screening study (Ayed et al., 2013). The creation of chemicals, fertilizer, pesticides, food experiments,
and other items frequently makes use of mixed designs. In fewer experiment times, it can use regression analysis to determine the
link between formulation and performance [9, 11, 14].
For dye change and decolorization indicated as 0% removal, the initial dye absorbance with RTW solution was utilized as a refer-
ence.
Fourier Transform Infrared Analysis for Mixed CI RR 220- RTW-Removal Estimation
After the decolorization process was finished, the medium was centrifuged for 25 minutes at 10,000 rpm. With equal quantities of
ethyl acetate, CI RR 220 was successfully double extracted in a genuine RTW. In a rotating evaporator, the concentration of isolat-
ed  metabolites  was  dried.  After  the  extraction  processes  were  finished,  the  residue  that  remained  in  the  flask  was  dissolved  in
methanol. Utilizing a UV–visible spectrophotometer, the degree of decolorization was assessed. Then, using FTIR (Perkin-Elmer,
Spectrum One) to describe the metabolites produced by dye biodegradation, they were compared to the control dye (the non-de-
graded one). Using 16 scan speeds, the FTIR analysis was conducted in the mid-IR range of 400–4000 cm-1. Pellets were fixed in a
sample holder, samples were combined with spectroscopically pure KBr at a ratio of 2:200, and analysis was performed [11].
Toxicity Assessment of the CI RR 220-RTW Solution Before and After Degradation
Phytoxicity Assessment
Triticum turgidum ssp. durum seeds were used in a phytotoxicity assay to evaluate the potential toxicity of CI RR 220 in a real
RTW and its associated metabolites [2]. The extracted product (dry) and CI RR 220 were independently diluted in distilled water
to achieve the desired final concentrations of 1000, 750, 500, and 250 ppm. The 70 seeds of each plant species were grown indepen-
dently in a control dye solution, and the extracted dye metabolite was used to test the plants' toxicity. After seven days, the percent-
age of germination of the seed was finally recorded (%). Every test was conducted three times.
Mutagenicity Assessment
Rats administered Aroclor 1254 were used to produce the S9 microsome fraction. 1 milliliter of salt solution, 0.25 milliliters of 1 M
G6P, 2 milliliters of 0.1 M NADP, 25 milliliters of 0.2 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 7 milliliters of S9 microsome fraction,
and 14.75 milliliters of water made up the S9 mix [15]. Every experiment required a fresh preparation of the S9 mix. The protein
BioRad test was used to measure the protein content of rat liver S9 [6]. The measurement was 12.3 mg/mL. The S. Typhimurium
TA98 mutagenicity test was carried out in accordance with earlier instructions [6]. In the presence of S.Typhimurium TA98 [16].
For 48 hours, the plates and the revertant bacterial colonies on each plate were incubated at 37° C.5 Journal of Environmental Pollution and Management

Strain Isolation and Identification
Chlorella and Sphingomonas paucimobilis were isolated from raw effluents from a textile wastewater plant located in Ksar Hellal,
Tunisia [5, 17] and Lactobacillus acidophilus [9] (Ayed et al., 2019a) was isolated from kefir and selected based on her ability to de-
colorize CI RR 220 in a real RTW.

Experiment Design and Model Analysis
The experimental values of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Sphingomonas paucimobilis, and Chlorella in decolorized dye utilizing com-
bination starter are shown in Table 2. The regression models for the three responses: color, phenol, and COD removal were creat-
ed using linear regression fitting. Due to the orthogonality of the design, each effect was evaluated independently in Eqs. (1, 2, and
3). Y stands for the COD, phenol, and color removal. RSM is typically used in accordance with screening studies to investigate the
factors that the previous study indicated in the interest region [4, 18]. Regression analysis using the mixed design can determine
the relationship between formulation and performance in fewer trial times.

The study's R2 values were 0.8912, 0.8949, and 0.3892, indicating that the independent variables account for 89.12%, 89.49%, and
38.92% of the total variations, while the model for COD, phenol, and color removal only explains 10.88%, 10.51%, and 61.08% of
the changes overall. When a high value of R2 was attained, Altayb and colleagues [10] claim that the generated model can provide
a good assessment for the response within the range of process circumstances. The Fisher F-test (Table 3) in conjunction with anal-
ysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to confirm the model's sufficiency and significance The F-value is the mean square of the re-
gression  over  the  mean  square  of  the  residual.  The  mean  square  is  computed  by  dividing  the  sum  of  the  squares  of  the  error
variance and the model variance by the corresponding degree of freedom. Ayed et al. [19] state that the computed F-value must be
higher than the tabulated F-value from the standard distribution table in order to support the model's efficacy based on the experi-
mental data [19]. Table 3 displays the ANOVA model for the COD and color removal with a high confidence level of 95%. Accord-
ing to the model F-value, the regression equation accounts for the majority of the variation in the answer. To determine if the F-ra-
tio is large enough to suggest statistical significance, one uses the related P-value. If the P-value is more than 0.1, meaning that α =
0.05 or 95% confidence level is reached, the model cannot be deemed statistically significant. The quadratic model is statistically
significant for the response, as indicated by the non-significant value of lack of fit (>0.05), and as such, it can be employed for addi-
tional analysis [4, 9].

Probability
Interpretation of Residual Plot
The residual values can then be plotted in a normal probability plot for phenol (Figure 1A(a)), COD (Figure 1B(a)) and color remo-
val (Figure 1C(a)). All points from this residual plot lies close to the straight line confirming the conjecture that effects other than
those considered in the model may be readily explained by random [20]. The experimental values were scattered randomly within
a constant range of residuals across the graph, which indicated that the proposed model and constant variance assumption were
suitable [5].7 Journal of Environmental Pollution and Management
ScholArena | www.scholarena.com Volume 6 | Issue 1Also, plotting externally studentized residuals versus an experimental runs plot shows that all the data points lay within the limits,
which indicated satisfactory fit of the developed model for phenol (Figure 1A(b)), COD (Figure 1B(b)) and color (Figure 1C (b))
removal.
The histogram of the residual (Figure 1A(c); 1B(c) and 1C (c)) can be used to check whether the variance is normally distributed
[4]. A symmetric bell shaped histogram which is evenly distributed around zero indicates that the normality assumption is likely
to be true. In addition, the correlation between the predicted and actual values is shown in in which the points were close to the di-
agonal line and implied low discrepancies between them [9].
Also,  plotting  externally  residuals  versus  an  experimental  runs  plot  (Figure  1A(d)  ;  1B(d)  and  1C(d),),  shows  that  all  the  data
points lay within the limits, which indicated satisfactory fit of the developed model [21]. The experimental values were scattered
randomly within a constant range of residuals across the graph, which indicated that the proposed model and constant variance as-
sumption were suitable.

Interpretation of Contour Plot
In order to confirm the phenol 85%, 98 % COD and 99 % color removal obtained experimental results; a contour plot (Figure 2)
was plotted. The higher phenol (85.02%), COD (97.24%) and color removal (95.23%) yields were obtained when Chlorella, Sphin-
gomonas  paucimobilis,  and  Lactobacillus  acidophilus  proportions  were  (42.81%,  27.95  %  and  29.22  %);  (38.49%,  35.27  %  and
26.23 %) and (55.38%, 0.082 % and 44.53 %, respectively for phenol, COD and color removal.
The mixture surface plot also described individual and cumulative effect of these three variables and their subsequent effect on the
response [22].
Additionally, Dafale and collaborators [23] showed that 70% COD was removed during shaking condition for Remazol Black B
(RBB) [23]. Similarly, Jadhav and collaborators [24] indicated that Galactomyces geotrichum MTCC 1360 was able to decolorize
Methyl Red (100%), Malachite green (97%), Scarlet RR (100%), Orange HE 4B (75%) and Amido black 10B (92%) in malt yeast
medium with shaking condition [24].

FTIR and UV-Visible Spectroscopy Analysis for Adsorption and Removal of CI RR 220-RTW
To understand the possible way of decolorization of CI RR 220 in real RTW, the supernatant was analyzed by UV-visible spec-
trophotometer and FTIR. Biodegradation of CI RR 220 by selected organisms was confirmed by FTIR spectroscopic analysis (Fig-
ure 4a and 4b). Biodegradation is indicated either by disappearance of absorbance peaks or appearance of new peaks [25]. The
FTIR spectrum of the dye before biodegradation represented H–bonded of alcohols and phenols at 3480 cm -1 , S=O at 1100 cm-1
and C-N at 1620 cm-1. O–H stretch, H–bonded of alcohols and phenols is a very broad and strong band which took an active part
in the adsorption of CI RR 220 because of the presence of hydrogen bonding. The FTIR spectrum of 5days extracted metabolites
showed a significant change in the bands positions compared to control dye spectrum. The intensities of band at 3480 cm-1, 1620
cm-1 and 1100 cm-1 was decreased and a new band observed at 850 cm-1 represented C–H deformation of alicyclic CH2, whereas
another band were disappeared, it represents a response of an out-of-plane deformation of a hydrogen atom linked to an aromatic
cycle and the decomposition of the azo group and formation of aromatic amines which are of low basicity. The disappearance of
absorption peaks and appearance of new peaks in the FTIR spectrum were reported due to biodegradation of CI RR 220.11 Journal of Environmental Pollution and Management
ScholArena | www.scholarena.com Volume 6 | Issue 1
Figure 4:  FTIR spectra of CI Reactive Red 220 before (a) and after degradation (b) under optimized condition in effluent textile wastewater.
Changes in the UV–Vis absorption spectrum (e.g., from 200 to 500 nm) were observed for decolorization of CI RR 220 and com-
pared to the respective control samples. Dyes adsorption on the surface of bacterial cells or biodegradation is primarily responsible
for the bacteria assisted de-colorization of dyes [26]. For dye adsorption, the peaks in the UV–Vis absorption spectrum diminish al-
most in a proportional ratio to each other. However, in case of biodegradation of dyes, either the crucial absorbance peaks in the
UV-visible region completely vanished or new peaks popped up. The UV–Vis absorption spectrum (200–600 nm) (Figure 5) of CI
RR 220 dye showed a shift in λmax (514nm) of the control to a shorter wavelength (258 nm) upon complete decolourization, de-
monstrating the formation of new pic at 375nm, 314nm and 284nm in the supernatant of culture media as a consequence of dye
biodegradation. Figure 5 shows the UV–vis absorption spectra of the initial solutions and the decolorized samples of CI RR 220 in
real RTW from the SBR. As the biodegradation proceeded (5 days), the peak at 514 nm disappeared. The disappearance in absor-
bance at 514 nm is likely due to the degradation of the CI RR 220 chromophore [27], and the degradation is constant in one cycle.
The shift in light absorbance spectra is attributed to new metabolites due to biodegradation of the parent compound [25, 28, 29].Journal of Environmental Pollution and Management 12

Phytotoxicity of the Treated CI RR 220 in RTW
The reuse of treated wastewaters in agricultural activities can be a feasible solution to tackle water scarcity in water-stressed re-
gions of the world. Unfortunately, few studies in the literature have systematically assessed the potential of treated textile wastewa-
ters for irrigation or the effects over soil chemical composition and plant growth. The unexpectedly superior growth of Triticum
turgidum ssp. durum when irrigated with RTW may be attributed to the high macronutrients and micronutrients content of the
raw wastewater compared to tap water. These results highlighted the potential reuse of treated water for plant irrigation. Finally, it
is worth noting that the high Triticum turgidum ssp. durum dry weight, and area and number of leaves, recorded when irrigated
with RTW, and the lack of difference in plant physiology when compared to the plants irrigated with treated water, might be due
to the limited duration of the experiments conducted. Thus, it was of concern to assess the phytotoxicity (Table 4) of the dye CI
RR 220 before (germination 0%) and after degradation. The control test was the distilled water (germination 100%). Plant seed ger-
mination and early seedling growth test have been considered as one of the simplest and short-term methods for the study of the
general toxicity of the chemicals and industrial wastewaters [6]. The phytotoxicity indicated a no toxicity of the degradation prod-
ucts to the plants. Similarly we have showed that the percentage of germination of Triticum aestivum was less using Malachite
Green and Crystal Violet solution compared to its degraded products [12]. Hence phytotoxicity studies revealed that the biodegra-
dation of wastewater containing dyes by a microbial culture resulted by its complete detoxification. These treated effluents can be
used for ferti-irrigation. However these findings suggested the non-toxic nature of the formed products. Previous works showed
that the Malachite Green and Crystal Violet degradation into leucomalachite and leucocrystal violet are equally toxic to the initial
compound [30].

Generally, a compound is classified as mutagen if it is able to increase at least twice the number of revertants compared to sponta-
neous revertant [16]. We reported in this investigation that after biodegradation of CI RR 220 the mutagenicity decreased when
compared to the untreated pure dye even with the S9 metabolizing system. The revertant number exceeds 2-folds the spontaneous
revertants in Salmonella Typhimurium TA98 assay systems at the highest tested dose of 250 g/assay. However, we noticed no muta-
genicity of CIRR220 products obtained after biodegradation with optimised consortium (46.41% Chlorella, 16.81% Sphingomonas
paucimobilis and 16.81% Lactobacillus acidophilus) with the S9 metabolizing system (Table 5). According to Ben Mansour and col-
laborators [15] the absence of mutagenic effect of azo dye AV7 metabolites from shaken cultures with Pseudomonas putida mt-2
could be explained by the presence of a sufficient level of dissolved oxygen that might limit the azoreductase action and increase
the oxygenase activity, allowing the degradation of the dye aromatic amines to which may be ascribed the mutagenic effects [15].

Conclusion
Our study proved the ability of Chlorella, Sphingomonas paucimobilis and Lactobacillus acidophilus to degrade and detoxify the
industrial reactive azo dye CI RR220 in real textile wastewater, and displayed their potential uses in degradation of textile dye and
converts  non  toxic  products  to  the  environment.  The  phytotxicity  experiments  demonstrated  a  superior  detoxification  of  CI
RR220 by this consortium. This study was conclude the mutagenicity and phytotoxicity of the intact dye and degraded products ofJournal of Environmental Pollution and Management 14

The  competence  of  the  bacterial  consortium  to  degrade  high  concentrations  of  reactive  dyes  and  convert  them  into  non  toxic
byproducts for plants, human and aquatic life forms attracts Chlorella, Sphingomonas paucimobilis and Lactobacillus acidophilus
as a potential micro-organism for bioremediation of textile dyes. These results indicate that the bacteria would represent a promis-
ing biotechnological tool for the biodegradation of environments co-contaminated with textile wastewater.
