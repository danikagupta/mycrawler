Carcinogenicity
Phenytoin and its sodium salt are reasonably anticipated to be hu -
man carcinogens based on sufficient evidence from studies in exper -
imental animals. 
Cancer Studies in Experimental Animals 
Phenytoin as its sodium salt caused lymphoma and leukemia in mice 
by two different routes of exposure. Administration of phenytoin so -
dium in a liquid diet caused thymic and generalized lymphoma in 
females, and administration by intraperitoneal injection caused leuke -
mia and thymic and mesenteric lymphoma in both sexes (IARC 1977).
Since phenytoin and phenytoin sodium were listed in the First 
Annual Report on Carcinogens, additional studies in rodents have 
been identified. The effects of phenytoin in mice and rats were eval -
uated following dietary exposure of adults, perinatal exposure ( in 
utero  and via lactation), or combined perinatal and adult exposure. 
In mice, phenytoin caused liver tumors in females after adult-only 
exposure or combined perinatal and adult exposure and in males af -
ter combined perinatal and adult exposure; liver-tumor incidence 
was not significantly increased in male mice after adult-only expo -
sure. In rats, phenytoin marginally increased the incidence of liver 
tumors in males after adult-only exposure or combined perinatal and 
adult exposure; however, the effect was not enhanced by the com -
bined exposure (NTP 1993).
Cancer Studies in Humans 
The data available from epidemiological studies are inadequate to 
evaluate the relationship between human cancer and exposure spe -
cifically to phenytoin. Several case reports and case series linked 
cancer outcomes to treatment with phenytoin, including reports of 
lymphoma among individuals undergoing phenytoin therapy, but no 
significant excess of lymphoma was reported in two small follow-up 
studies of lymphoma among epilepsy patients (IARC 1977). 
Since phenytoin and phenytoin sodium were listed in the First An -
nual Report on Carcinogens, additional epidemiological studies have 
been identified. The International Agency for Research on Cancer 
concluded that there was inadequate evidence for the carcinogenicity 
of phenytoin in humans (IARC 1996). In studies of brain and central 
nervous system cancer in patients given phenytoin for epilepsy, sig -
nificantly increased risks were observed in a cohort mortality study 
of patients treated with phenobarbital and phenytoin (White  et al.  
1979) and in two cohort incidence studies of patients treated with 
phenytoin (with or without phenobarbital) (Olsen et al.  1989, Selby 
et al. 1989). However, IARC noted that brain tumors could have been the cause of the seizure disorder and were unlikely to be drug re -
lated. Findings from case-control studies were inclusive (IARC 1996).
Properties
Phenytoin is a white, odorless powder at room temperature (Ak -
ron 2009). It is practically insoluble in water, but it is soluble in ace -
tone, ethanol, and alkali hydroxides (IARC 1996). It is stable under 
normal temperatures and pressures (Akron 2009). The only physical 
property identified for phenytoin sodium (molecular weight = 274.2) 
was its solubility in water (1 g in ~66 mL) and its insolubility in ether 
and chloroform (HSDB 2009). Phenytoin sodium dissociates easily 
to regenerate phenytoin, even in weakly acidic solutions. Phenytoin 
may also be administered as the water-soluble prodrug fosphenytoin 
(molecular weight = 362.3) or its disodium salt (molecular weight = 
406.2), which are converted to phenytoin by phosphatases in the 
liver (McNamara et al. 2001). Fosphenytoin solubility in water is es -
timated as 349 mg/L at 25°C, and fosphenytoin disodium salt is solu -
ble at 142 mg/mL at 25°C (O’Neil et al.  2006). Physical and chemical 
properties of phenytoin are listed in the following table.

Use
Phenytoin is an anticonvulsant drug used alone or in combination 
with phenobarbital or other anticonvulsant drugs to treat patients 
with tonic-clonic (grand mal), focal, and psychomotor seizures (IARC 
1977, 1996). It can be used to control seizures occurring during neu -
rosurgery and to reverse digitalis-induced arrhythmia. Phenytoin is 
also used in a 10% ointment formulation to promote healing of ulcers 
in patients with diabetes (Younes  et al.  2006).  In the past, phenytoin 
was used to treat acute alcoholism, migraine, polyneuritis, pregnancy 
disorders, certain psychoses, and trigeminal neuralgia. Phenytoin is 
also used to control seizures in dogs (IARC 1977, 1996, NTP 1993). 
Production
Commercial production of phenytoin was first reported in the United 
States in 1946 (IARC 1977). U.S. sales totaled 1,093,250 standard 
dosage units in 1990 and 984,527 in 1995 (IARC 1996). In 2009, 
phenytoin was available from 14 U.S. suppliers (ChemSources 2009), 
and 35 pharmaceutical products contained phenytoin as an active 
ingredient (FDA 2009a). No specific data on U.S. imports or exports 
of phenytoin were found.
Exposure
The routes of potential human exposure to phenytoin are injec -
tion, ingestion, inhalation, and dermal contact (NTP 1993, HSDB 
2009). Statistics on the number of patients using phenytoin were 
not available, but the drug is widely used by individuals suffering 
from epilepsy (Epilepsy.com 2007). Phenytoin is the active ingredi -
ent in seven oral pharmaceutical products, and sodium phenytoin 
in nine oral products and four injectable formulations (Drugs.com 
2009b). Fosphenytoin, which is a phosphate ester prodrug converted 
to phenytoin (Browne et al.  1996), is available in one short-term 
injectable formulation used to administer phenytoin to individuals 
who cannot take an oral medication (e.g., during status epilepticus) National Toxicology Program, Department of Health and Human Services 2Report on Carcinogens, Fifteenth Edition For definitions of technical terms, see the Glossary.
(Drugs.com 2009a). The initial oral dosage of phenytoin for adults 
and children over 6 years of age is 100 mg 3 times per day; the dos -
age may be gradually increased by 100 mg every two to four weeks 
until the desired therapeutic response is obtained. Daily maintenance 
dosages usually range from 300 to 600 mg for adults and 3 to 10 mg/
kg of body weight for children under 6 years of age (NTP 1993). As 
a cardiac depressant, phenytoin is usually administered in an oral 
dose of 100 mg two to four times per day or by intravenous injec -
tion of 50 to 100 mg every 10 to 15 minutes up to a maximum dose 
of 10 to 15 mg/kg of body weight (IARC 1977). Patients with large 
diabetic ulcers may receive dermal applications of an ointment con -
taining 10% phenytoin to promote healing (Younes et al. 2006). Phe -
nytoin is also given for pain associated with peripheral neuropathy, 
for bipolar disorder, and for localized scleroderma; usual therapeu -
tic levels are 10 to 20 μg/mL in blood (SF 2008, MedlinePlus 2009). 
In 2009, 48 clinical trials involving phenytoin were in progress or re -
cently completed, including 22 that were recruiting patients in the 
United States (ClinicalTrials 2009). Phenytoin was also found as an 
undeclared drug in several weight-loss products marketed as dietary 
supplements (FDA 2009b).
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Toxics 
Release Inventory, environmental releases of phenytoin before 2007 
ranged from 8,000 to 20,000 lb except in 2002, when no releases were 
reported, and in 2003, when 41,000 lb was released. In 2007, one fa -
cility released 40 lb of phenytoin to air (TRI 2009).
Occupational exposure to phenytoin may occur among workers 
involved in formulation and packaging of the pharmaceutical prod -
ucts and health professionals involved in its preparation and admin -
istration. The National Occupational Exposure Survey (conducted 
from 1981 to 1983) estimated that 23,400 workers, including 16,795 
women, potentially were exposed to phenytoin (NIOSH 1990).
