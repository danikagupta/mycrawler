Introduction
Of the many classes of synthetic dyes used in the textile
and dyeing industries, triphenylmethane dyes are the mostversatile and play a predominant role in various industrialapplications [1]. The triphenylmethane dye crystal violethas been used extensively in human and veterinary medi-
cine as a biological stain and as a textile dye in the textileprocessing industry. Crystal violet has been classified as arecalcitrant dye and remains in the environment for longperiods of time. It is toxic to aquatic and terrestrial life [1,2]. Research on crystal violet in vitro has shown that this dye
is a mitotic poisoning agent. In addition, in vivo studies have
proven that it should be regarded as a biohazard substance.Pol. J. Environ. Stud. Vol. 22, No. 5 (2013), 1297-1306

Abstract
Acinetobacter baumannii , Corynebacterium sp., Cytophaga columnaris , Escherichia coli ,
Pseudomonas fluorescens , and P . luteola bacteria isolated from the sewage disposal lake in Jeddah, Saudi
Arabia, can decolorize crystal violet (CV). P . fluorescens was the most potent CV decolorizer, and
Corynebacterium sp. was also able to perform this function. Five different media were tested to determine
which medium formulation favoured CV decolorization by P . fluorescens and Corynebacterium sp. The basal
medium favoured the highest decolorization percentage of 50 μg CV/ml after 72 h of incubation. P . fluorescens
was sufficient to decolorize concentrations of CV up to 150 μg/ml after 92 h of incubation. A mixed bacterialculture of P . fluorescens and Corynebacterium sp. more fully decolorized CV than did a single; the decol-
orization period for the mixed culture was reduced by more than 37% and the decolorization rate (μg/h)increased by up to 59%. Two-phase multifactorial optimization statistical analysis (Plackett-Burman and Box-Behnken) were carried out to optimize culture conditions in order to increase the ability of a mixed culture todecolorize 150 μg CV/ml. Under the optimized conditions the decolorization period was reduced by more than22% and the decolorization rate was increased by more than 48%.
Crystal violet can be efficiently decolorized by P . fluorescens and Corynebacterium sp. The decoloriza-
tion process is markedly influenced by the composition of the cultivation medium and the concentration ofCV . A mixed culture of P . fluorescens and Corynebacterium sp. was much more efficient at decolorizing CV
than was a monoculture. The culture conditions were considerably optimized using Plackett-Burman and Box-Behnken statistical experimental designs.

Currently, various chemical and physical treatment
methods, including adsorption, chemical precipitationand flocculation, oxidation, electrolysis, reduction, elec-trochemical treatment, and ion-pair extraction are used toremove this dye from the sewage [1, 3-5]. These methodsare attractive because of their efficiency but are compli-cated and expensive [6]. As a viable alternative, biologi-cal processes have received increasing attention due totheir cost, effectiveness, ability to produce less sludge,and environmental harmlessness [7]; these processes canconvert or degrade this pollutant into water, carbon diox-ide and various salts of inorganic nature [8]. A wide vari-ety of microorganisms are able to decolorize a wide rangeof dyes, including bacteria (single and mixed cultures),fungi, and algae [9-21]. They can decolorize and evencompletely mineralize many dyes under certain condi-tions and the medium composition can influence thisprocess [22-24].
Medium optimization using a statistical analysis was
recently used for the decolorization of dyes [12, 21, 25, 26].Therefore, the present work aimed to maximize decoloriza-tion of CV by bacteria using single and mixed culture tech-niques under aerobic conditions. The culture conditions foroptimizing the bacterial CV decolorization process wereoptimized using the Plackett-Burman and Box-Behnkenstatistical designs.
Materials and Methods
Bacterial Isolates
The bacteria that were tested for crystal violet (CV)
decolorization were isolated locally from the sewagewastewater and sediment habitat of the sewage disposallake in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, using an enrichment proce-dure adapted from Banat et al. [27]. Both liquid and solidminimal media were modified from Wong and Yuen [28],and contained the following (g/l): glucose, 3.0;(NH
4)2SO4, 1.0; K2HPO4, 7.0; MgSO4·7H2O, 0.1 and
NaCl, 5.0. The media were fortified with 50 μg CV/ml
and used for isolation CV decolorizing bacteria. The puri-fied bacteria were identified as Acinetobacter baumannii ,
Corynebacterium sp., Cytophaga columnaris ,
Escherichia coli , Pseudomonas fluorescens , and
Pseudomonas luteola according to Bergy’s Mannual of
Systematic Bacteriology [29]. They were maintained onnutrient agar slants with monthly transfers.
Chemicals
The heterocyclic CV dye (C25N3H30Cl) was of pure
grade purchased from Merck Chemical Company. The
media ingredients were all of analytical grade and wereobtained from recognized chemical suppliers.Inoculum and Cultivation
Seed cultures were prepared by inoculating Laury
Broth (LB) medium containing (g/l): peptone, 1.0; yeastextract, 5.0; and NaCl, 5, with a loop-full of bacteria froma single colony and were shaken for 24 h at 120 rpm at30ºC and pH 7. Thereafter, a 2 ml inoculum of anabsorbance (A
550) at 550 nm was used to inoculate 50 ml
aliquots of the basal medium, which contained (g/l): glu-
cose, 3.0; yeast extract, 2.0; (NH4)2SO4, 2.0; K2HPO4, 6.0;
KH2PO4, 1.0; MgSO4·7H2O, 0.1; NaCl, 5.0; FeSO4·5H2O,
0.001; MnSO4· H2O, 0.01 [30] and was dispensed in 250 ml
Erlenmeyer flasks. Stock solutions of these media were
sterilized separately by autoclaving at 121ºC for 15 min-utes. A stock solution of CV was prepared by dissolving 30mg in 100 ml of solvent (water: ethanol, 9:1), sterilized by0.22 µm Syringe Filter, and added separately at a concen-tration of 50 μg/ml (unless otherwise stated). The flaskswere shaken (150 rpm) at 37ºC for the given period. Thebasal medium was modified according to the statisticalexperimental designs.
Decolorization Assay
Bacterial growth at the end of the fermentation period
was isolated by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 15 min toobtain clear supernatant. The CV concentration in thecleared supernatant was determined spectrophotometricallyat 595 nm [31]. Medium lacking CV was used as a control.The following parameters were calculated:
Decolorization % = Decolorized CV (μg/ml)/
Initial CV (μg/ml) ×100
Rate of decolorization (μg/h) = Decolorized CV (μg)/

Decolorization of CV by the Bacterial Isolates
The six bacterial isolates were cultivated in 50 ml
aliquots of the basal medium fortified with 50 μg CV/ml for48 h under shaking conditions (150 rpm) at 37ºC.Thereafter, the residual CV was estimated to determine themost efficient CV decolorizing bacterium.
Effect of Different Cultivation Media
The quantity and quality of ingredients of the cultivation
medium that favoured decolorization of 50 μg CV/ml by themost active tested bacteria ( P . fluorescens and
Corynebacterium sp.) were determined using five different
media (including the basal medium as No. 5), as follows (g/l):1) Starch, 1.3; (NH
4)NO3, 1.0; K2HPO4, 1.0; KH2PO4, 1.0;

After an incubation period of 72 h, the residual CV was
estimated. 
Decolorization of Different Concentrations of CV
The decolorization of different concentrations of CV
(50, 75, 100, 125, and 150 μg/ml) were determined using thebest medium (No. 5) and the most efficient bacterium ( P . flu-
orescens ). The incubation period for each CV concentration
was extended until complete decolorization was achieved.
Decolorization of CV by a Bacterial Consortium
A bacterial culture of the most potent bacterium ( P . flu-
orescens ) for CV decolorization and Corynebacterium sp.
(the second most efficient) was inoculated (2 ml/ flask, 1:1)into a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 50 ml aliquots ofthe best medium (No. 5) supplemented with 150 μg CV/ml.At the end of the incubation period required for completedecolorization of CV , the residual CV was calculated.
Each experiment was carried out in triplicate and the
obtained results are the arithmetic mean. The initial pHvalue in all experiments was adjusted to 7 and the final pHvalues ranged from 6.2 to 7.2. 
Statistical Optimization
Plackett-Burman Design
The Plackett-Burman experimental design, a fractional
factorial design, [35] was used to assess the relative impor-tance of various environmental factors on CV decoloriza-tion by a mixed culture. Eleven independent variables werescreened in fourteen combinations organized according tothe Plackett-Burman design matrix (Table 3) for each vari-able; a high (+) and a low (-) level were tested. All trialswere performed in duplicate and the averages of the decol-orization results observed were treated as responses. Themain effect of each variable (Table 2) was determined usingthe following equation:
Exi= (ΣMi+– ΣMi-)/N
...where Exiis the variable main effect, Mi+and Mi-are the
CV decolorization percentages in trials where the indepen-
dent variable (xi) was present in high and low concentrations,respectively, and N is the number of trials divided by 2. Amain effect figure with a positive sign indicates that the highconcentration of this variable is closer to optimum level, anda negative sign indicates that the low concentration of thisvariable is closer to the optimum level. Using MicrosoftExcel, statistical t-values for equal unpaired samples (Table
2) were calculated to determine variable significance.
Box-Behnken Design
We used a central composite design [36]. In this model,
the most significant independent variables, designated (A),(B), and (C) were included and each of them was examinedat three different levels, low (-), high (+) or basal (0).According to the applied design, nine dye treatment combi-nations were tested. For predicting the optimal level, thefollowing second order polynomial model was fitted to cor-relate the relationship between independent variables andthe response:
Y=b0+b1A+b2B+b3C+b12AB+b13AC+b23BC+
b11A2+b22B2+b33C2
...where Y is the dependent variable (CV decolorization %);
A, B, and C are the levels of the independent variables; b0
is the regression coefficient at the centre point; b1, b2and b3
are linear coefficients; b12, b13, and b23are the second order
interaction coefficients; and b11, b22, and b33are quadratic
coefficients. The values of the coefficients were calculated
using Microcal Origin 4.1 software and the optimum con-centrations were predicted using Microsoft Excel 2000. Thequality of the fit of the polynomial model equation wasexpressed using the coefficient of determination, R
2. The
optimal CV decolorization value was estimated using thesolver function of Microsoft Excel. Three-dimensionalgraphical representations were also constructed using sta-tistic 6.1 software to reflect the effects as well as the inter-actions of independent variables in these tests.
Results and Discussion
Decolorization of CV by Bacterial Isolates
The preliminary selection of CV decolorizing bacteria
was based on the decolorization of CV on minimal mediumplates. The chosen bacterial isolates were able to form clearzones when grown on solid medium containing CV withoutany visible sorption of CV to the biomass. This suggests thatdecolorization was achieved by a degradative process bysecreting dye hydrolyzing enzymes [21, 30]. The six bacte-rial isolates ( Acinetobacter baumannii , Corynebacterium
sp.,Cytophaga columnaris , Escherichia coli , Pseudomonas
fluorescens , and Pseudomonas luteola ) showed variations
in the decolorization percentages of CV (50 μg/ml) in liq-uid medium (Table 1). This reflects differences in enzymat-ic dye reduction activities [21, 30, 37]. P . fluorescens was
the most active CV decolorizer (90.54%) followed byCorynebacterium sp. (82.43%), while the rest of the tested
bacteria displayed lower CV decolorizing activities after 48h of incubation. It was reported that bacterial species ofPseudomonas and Corynebacterium can be used success-
fully for dye decolorization [16, 21, 31, 38, 39]. The previ-ous results indicated that the decolorization of dyes dependsDecolorization of Crystal Violet... 1299on the bacterial genus and species, and may depend on its
strain. Previous work [21], on the same bacterial speciesusing the same culture conditions, indicated that P . fluo-
rescens and Corynebacterium sp. poorly decolorized meth-
ylene blue, while E. coli and P . luteola were the most active.
However, in the present work E. coli and P . luteola were the
least active CV decolorizing bacteria (24.32 and 25.10%,respectively). This indicates that decolorization of dyesdepends on the decolorizing organism and on the type ofdye. 
Effect of Different Cultivation Media on CV
Decolorization by P . fluorescens
and Corynebacterium sp.
Our results (Fig. 1 a, b) indicated that the formulation of
medium No. 5 contained the necessary ingredients favor theproduction and/or activity of the enzymes responsible for93.24% decolorization by P . fluorescens and 83.78% decol-
orization by Corynebacterium sp. of 50 μg CV/ml medium
after 72 h of incubation. In accordance with this finding,Ghanem et al. [21] found that the same medium was the bestfor decolorization of methylene blue by E. coli and P . luteo-
la. This indicates that this medium is a good medium for dye
decolorization and suggests that the decolorization of dyesdepends mainly on the dye structure and the test organism.The importance of the environmental conditions, includingthe components of the cultivation medium, in the decol-orization process and even complete mineralization of dyesby microorganisms is clearly shown [21-24].

Because the maximal decoloriza-
tion rate (μg CV/h) occurred at a relatively high dye con-centration, P . fluorescens seems to be suitable for decol-
orization of an environment with a high dye load. Similarfindings that increases in the incubation period with elevat-ed dye concentrations were usually accompanied by elevat-ed decolorization rates have been reported [9, 10, 16, 21,32, 40]. Decolorization of Crystal Violet... 1301

of P . fluorescens and Corynebacterium sp.
To increase the rate of CV decolorization, a mixed cul-
ture of the most potent decolorizing bacteria ( P . fluorescens
and Corynebacterium sp.) was used to decolorize 150 μg
CV/ml. The results (Fig. 3) indicated that the decolorizationprocess was considerably enhanced, as 150 μg of CV/mlwas completely decolorized after only 58 h of incubation asopposed to 92 h by a single culture of P . fluorescens . This
indicates a 37% decrease in the incubation period and a59% increase in the decolorization rate (μg/h), indicatingthe economy and the efficiency of using a mixed culturerather than a single culture for the decolorization of CV . Theimportance and efficiency of a bacterial consortium todecolorize dyes instead of a single culture technique hasbeen previously reported [10-13, 15, 21, 32, 40-43].
Optimization of Culture Conditions Affecting 
CV Decolorization Using Plackett-Burman
Statistical Design
For elucidation of the culture conditions affecting CV
decolorization, the independent variables examined in thePlackett-Burman experiment and their settings are shown inTable 3. The main effect of each variable was calculatedaccording to the CV decolorization percentage results. Theresults presented (Table 2) revealed that the three most sig-
nificant factors determining the efficiency of the decol-
orization process were glucose concentration, the volumeof the medium/flask (aeration), and MnSO
4·H2O, with neg-
ative main effects of -61.74, -22.85, and -16.22, respective-
ly. This reflects the importance of glucose as a carbon andenergy source. Within the range of its tested concentrations(1-5 g/l), the lower glucose concentration led to increasedCV decolorization. This color removal ability under rela-tively low carbon (glucose) source concentrations has beenreported for degradation and decolorization of dyes eitherby single or mixed bacterial cultures [10, 11, 13, 16, 42].MnSO
4·H2O has a negative main effect within its tested
concentrations (0.05-0.15 g/l). This indicated that Mn ions
may inhibit the production and/or activity of CV decoloriz-ing enzymes. On the other hand, the volume of the medi-um/250 ml Erlenmeyer flask (aeration) has a negative maineffect of -22.85. This means that the air content (225 ml)remaining in the flask (250 ml flask volume minus 25 ml ofmedium) combined with the shaking rate of 150 rpm pro-1302 Al-Garni S. M., et al.

ml Erlenmeyer flask and inoculum size of 2 ml (3:1, P . flu-
orescens : Corynebacterium sp.). Under these conditions, a
38.37 h incubation period was enough for complete decol-orization (100%) of CV with a high decolorization rate of3.85 μg/h, i.e., Plackett-Burman optimization reduced theincubation period by more than 22% and increased the
decolorization rate by more than 48%, compared to thebasal non-optimized conditions. In a confirmatory experi-ment, the incubation period was found to be 39 h under thesame decolorization parameters. This indicated that 98.59%of the predicted period was reached.
Optimization of CV Decolorization Factors 
by Box-Behnken Design
In this second optimization step the levels of the three
significant independent variables glucose (A), ml medi-um/flask (B) and MnSO
4·H2O (C) were further investigat-
ed at three different levels (Table 4). Near optimum levels
of the other factors, as suggested by the Plackett-Burmanexperimental results, were used in all trials. All trials wereperformed in duplicate and the average of observations (CVDecolorization of Crystal Violet... 1303

sented in the form of surface plots (Figs. 4-6), showed therelationship and interaction between the independent vari-ables (glucose, ml of medium/flask, and MnSO
4·H2O) and
response (CV decolorization %). The levels of the exam-
ined independent variables needed to attain 100% decol-orization of 150 μg CV/ml were calculated and tested in averification experiment. The similarity between the predict-ed (100% CV degradation) and the observed results(100%), at 38 h of incubation, proves the accuracy of themodel and its application validity. The validity of the Box-Behnken design in the decolorization processes of dyes bymicroorganisms was recorded [12, 21, 25, 41, 44-46].
The results presented here indicated that a consortium
of P . fluorescens and Corynebacterium sp., under statisti-
cally optimized conditions, could completely decolorize150 μg CV/ml after 38 h of incubation with decolorizationrate of 3.95 μg/h. This concentration is higher than thatrecorded by El-Naggar et al. [31] using P . aeruginosa ,
which can only decolorize 50 μg CV/ml with a 1.35 μg/hdecolorization rate. This is also more than that recorded byParshetti et al. [47], who reported that Agrobacterium
radiobacter can decolorize at most 100 μg CV/ml after 86
h of incubation (decolorization rate equal to 1.6 μg/h).
Conclusion
Crystal violet can be efficiently decolorized by P . fluo-
rescens and Corynebacterium sp. The decolorization
process is markedly influenced by the composition of thecultivation medium and the concentration of CV . A mixedculture of P . fluorescens and Corynebacterium sp. was
more efficient at decolorizing CV than was a single culturetechnique (150 μg CV/ml was completely decolorized afteronly 58 h of incubation instead of 92 h by a single cultureof P . fluorescens ). The culture conditions were considerablyoptimized using the statistical experimental designs of
Plackett-Burman and Box-Behnken (150 μg CV/ml after38 h of fermentation).
