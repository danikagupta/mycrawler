COMPLAINT 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 I. INTRODUCTION 1. This case is brought against the major nationwide suppliers and distributors of talcum powder products in order to address an existing public health crisis arising from the sale of products that contain multiple carcinogens and reproductive toxins. The products at issue involve nationwide retail brands, such as Johnson’s Baby, Gold Bond, and Shower to Shower. They also include private label brands distributed and sold at large nationwide retailers, including CVS, Dollar General, Target, Walgreens, and Walmart. 2. Under the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, Health and Safety Code section 25249.6, also known as “Proposition 65,” businesses must provide persons with a “clear and reasonable warning” before exposing individuals to chemicals known to the State to cause cancer or reproductive harm.  3. Proposition 65 requires businesses to provide warnings to Californians about significant exposures to chemicals that cause cancer, birth defects, or other reproductive harm.  These chemicals can be in the products that Californians purchase, that are in their homes or workplaces, or that are released into the environment. By requiring that this information be provided, Proposition 65 enables Californians to make informed decisions about their exposures to these chemicals.  4. The named Defendants have willfully violated Proposition 65 by manufacturing, distributing, and selling products with excess levels of dangerous chemicals. Defendants have for decades manufactured, distributed, or sold talcum powder products that contain multiple chemicals at levels known to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity. The carcinogenic chemicals and reproductive toxins at issue include: (1) arsenic (inorganic oxides); (2) chromium (hexavalent compounds); and (3) lead and lead compounds. The chemicals are listed Proposition 65 chemicals known to the State to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity and are referred to herein collectively as “Listed Chemicals.”  
COMPLAINT 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 5. As discussed in more detail herein, the talcum powder industry (the “Industry”) has had actual knowledge of the contamination of talcum powder products with multiple carcinogens and reproductive toxins. The Industry has also known that the presence of carcinogens and reproductive toxins within talcum powder products made the products unsafe and unfit to use in personal care.  6. For many years, the Industry has taken concerted action to conceal and hide the presence of carcinogen and reproductive toxins in talcum powder products from consumers and the general public. Such actions date back to at least 1976 when the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association (“CTFA”) issued so-called “purity standards” for talc used in cosmetic products. The CTFA is an Industry trade association that represents cosmetic and personal care products companies. Its work has included the promulgation of the Industry specification and definition for “talc.” This definition has been utilized by the personal care product companies, including Defendants herein. 7. As discussed more fully below, in 1976, the Industry adopted talc purity standards that were designed to hide the presence of carcinogen and reproductive toxins in talcum powder products. The Industry redefined “talc” to consist of a minimum of 90% talc with the remainder “consisting of naturally associated minerals.” The Industry specification further incorporates multiple carcinogens and reproductive toxins into the Industry definition of “talc.” (Ex. A.) Unbeknownst to consumers, the Industry specification for “talc” expressly includes arsenic (up to 3 ppm) and lead (up to 20 ppm lead). (Ex. A.) Other “naturally associated minerals” found in talcum powder products commonly include hexavalent chromium. 8. By including these carcinogens and reproductive toxins in the specification for “talc,” the Industry has misleadingly marketed talcum powder products as containing pure talc and has actively and knowingly taken steps to conceal the presence of Listed Chemicals from consumers. The Industry has done so with a profiteering motive, knowing that full disclosure would lead to significant loss in sales and, even more likely, the removal of talcum powder products from the market.  
COMPLAINT 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 9. Individuals who purchase, handle, or use talcum products are unknowingly exposed to Listed Chemicals in the course of the intended and reasonably foreseeable use of the products. This exposure has and continues to contribute to increased risk of cancer and reproductive toxicity to unsuspecting consumers.  10. Tragically, there is a growing body of scientific evidence linking the use of talcum powder to ovarian cancer. In fact, the health risks related to the use of talcum powder and its contribution to an increased risk of ovarian cancer is now well documented and widely accepted within the scientific community. This evidence has been ignored by the Industry, including Defendants herein, who have exposed consumers in California and throughout the nation to toxic and carcinogenic products without first warning consumers of the presence of Listed Chemicals in talcum powder. 11. Defendants’ conduct violates Proposition 65 and has caused substantial harm to California consumers and the general public. Plaintiff is entitled to relief, including injunctive relief, and civil penalties. II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE A. Jurisdiction 12. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to California Constitution Article VI, section 10, which grants the Superior Court “original jurisdiction in all causes except those given by statute to other trial courts.” The statute under which this action is brought does not specify any other basis for jurisdiction. 13. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants because they do business in California and have purposefully availed themselves of the privilege of conducting business activities within the State. Defendants have intentionally availed themselves of the California market through the supply and distribution, sale, marketing, and use of talcum powder products in California and have sufficient minimum contacts with California so as to render the exercise of jurisdiction over them by the California courts consistent with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.   
COMPLAINT 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 14. Plaintiff has complied with the procedural notice requirements of Proposition 65. This action is commenced more than 60 days from the date that Plaintiff gave notice of alleged violations of Section 25249.6 that are the subject of this private action to the Attorney General and the district attorney, city attorney, or prosecutor in whose jurisdiction the violations are alleged to have occurred, and to Defendants. Plaintiff is informed and believes that neither the Attorney General, any district attorney, any city attorney, nor any prosecutor has commenced and is diligently prosecuting an action against the violations at issue herein. B. Venue 15. Venue is proper in this Court because the cause, or part thereof, arises in Los Angeles County because Defendants’ products are sold and consumed in this county. Defendants have violated or threaten to violate California law in Los Angeles County. III. PARTIES A. Plaintiff Jan Graham 16. Plaintiff Jan Graham is a citizen of the State of California and a person within the meaning of Health & Safety Code section 25118.

IV. FACTUAL BACKGROUND A. About Talc 54. Talc is a clay mineral that is mined from underground deposits. Talc is composed of hydrated magnesium silicate with the chemical formula of Mg3Si4O10(OH)2. Talc is the softest mineral on earth. It is the main ingredient in consumer “talcum powder” products. 55. Because talc is mined from underground deposits, it is commonly contaminated with other chemicals found in talc powder deposits. Such chemicals include toxic heavy metals such as arsenic, hexavalent chromium, and lead. Contamination with arsenic, hexavalent chromium, and lead is nearly ubiquitous in talcum powder products. Indeed, the contamination is widely known within the Industry and acknowledged in the Industry’s specification for “talc” and “cosmetic talc.” 56. As a powder, talc absorbs moisture well and helps cut down on friction. It is touted and marketed by the Industry for keeping skin dry and helping to prevent rashes. Talc is widely used in cosmetic products such as baby powder, adult body powder, and foot powder. 57. For decades, for example, the talcum powder and cosmetic industries have marketed talcum powder to consumers for use as a feminine hygiene product and for use on babies for prevention or treatment of diaper rash. Images of smiling women and bare-bottomed babies have graced talcum powder advertisements for decades. 58. The Industry has marketed and sold talcum powder to unsuspecting consumers despite the Industry having decades of knowledge regarding the presence carcinogens and reproductive toxins (including Listed Chemicals) in talcum powder products.  
COMPLAINT 15 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 B. The Industry Has Had Knowledge of the Contamination of Talcum Powder Products with Multiple Carcinogens and Reproductive Toxins. 1. The Industry Has Knowingly and Intentionally Utilized a Deceptive and Misleading Definition of Talc that is Designed to Conceal the Presence of Listed Chemicals in Talcum Powder Products. 59. The Industry’s knowledge regarding the presence of carcinogens in talcum powder products spans several decades, but the Industry has knowingly failed disclose the presence of carcinogens and reproductive toxins in talcum powder products to consumers and the general public. 60. The Industry’s knowledge regarding the presence of carcinogens in talcum powder dates back to at least 1976, when the Cosmetic, Toiletry, and Fragrance Association (“CTFA”) promulgated so-called “purity standards” for  “talc.” The Industry purity standards and specifications for talc are knowingly and intentionally designed to conceal the presence of carcinogens and reproductive toxins in talcum powder products.  61. In 1976, the Industry expressly redefined “talc” to consist of a minimum of 90% hydrated magnesium silicate, with the remainder consisting of naturally associated minerals. (Ex. A; emphasis added) Unbeknownst to consumers, the Industry specification for “talc” expressly includes arsenic (up to 3 ppm) and lead (up to 20 ppm lead). (Ex. A.) 62. The presence of Listed Chemicals and the necessity for Proposition 65 warnings has been well known within the industry since before the enactment of Proposition 65. In fact, the need for Proposition 65 warnings has been acknowledged within Material Safety Data Sheets utilized by talc suppliers. By way of example, a Material Safety Data Sheet utilized by Brenntag, a leading supplier of talc within the Industry, states as follows:    
COMPLAINT 16 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 CALIFORNIA PROPOSITION 65: TALC MAY CONTAIN THE FOLLOWING PROPOSITION 65 REGULATED CHEMICALS IN THE FOLLOWING TYPICAL AMOUNTS: ARSENIC    2 PPM CADMIUM    2 PPM CHROMIUM   0.5 PPM MERCURY    0.5 PPM LEAD    5 PPM CRYSTALLINE SILICA  1.0%. MAXIMUM THESE CHEMICALS ARE PRESENT AS IMPURITIES AND OCCUR AS A RESULT OF THEIR NATURAL PRESENCE IN THE ORE FROM WHICH THE TALC IS PRODUCED. (Ex. B. at p. 5.) 63. Instead of warning consumer regarding the presence of Proposition 65 Listed Chemicals, CTFA and the Industry has utilized the term “cosmetic talc” and redefined “talc” used in cosmetic products to hide the presence of multiple carcinogens and reproductive toxins in talcum powder products. The Industry has done so in a patent effort to mislead consumers and the general public that the talc used in cosmetics was free of carcinogens or reproductive toxins. On information and belief, all Defendants herein have utilized a deceptive and misleading definition of “talc” in an effort to conceal the presence of multiple Listed Chemicals from end users and the general public. 2. All Defendants Have Knowingly Concealed the Presence of Carcinogens and Reproductive Toxins. 64. Plaintiff is informed and believes that the manufacturers and distributors of talcum powder products (including all Defendants herein) have adopted and knowingly benefited from the CTFA’s specifications and so-called purity standards. All Defendants have benefited from the Industry specification for “talc,” which intentionally conceals the presence of multiple reproductive toxins and carcinogens in the talcum powder products peddled by Defendants.  65. On information and belief, all Defendants have knowingly concealed the presence of multiple Listed Chemicals to consumers and the general public by adopting CTFA’s specification and definition of “talc” or “cosmetic talc.” They have done so with

C. Defendants Have Had Actual and Constructive Knowledge that Talcum Powder Products Were Unsafe and Unfit for Use In Personal Care. 94. For decades, the Industry has peddled talcum powder products to unsuspecting mothers to use on babies for prevention and treatment of diaper rash. They have also marketed talcum powder to women as a feminine hygiene product for use on  
COMPLAINT 26 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 their genitals and perineal area, either through direct application or by applying it to sanitary napkins. They have done so despite knowledge of the presence of multiple reproductive toxins and carcinogens in talc products. On information and belief, and based on investigation of counsel, the Industry was aware that talc products were unsafe and unfit for use in personal care and on infants with diaper rash. 95. The Industry was aware that talcum powder products were unfit for application on skin when the outer surface of skin or epidermal barrier1 is damaged, missing, or significantly interrupted. The Industry has been similarly aware that talc-containing baby powder products were unsafe and unfit to use on babies with diaper rash. However, the Industry has marketed baby powder products for prevention of diaper rash.  The Industry was similarly aware that the presence of carcinogens and reproductive toxins rendered talcum products unsafe and unfit for use in personal care. Yet, the major personal care companies, including Defendants herein, routinely procure talc that is contaminated with multiple carcinogens and reproductive toxins, and thus unfit for use in personal care. Defendants then continued to manufacture, distribute, or sell talcum powder products that contain multiple carcinogens and reproductive toxins and unfit for use for their intended purpose. D. J&J’s Misconduct Is Particularly Egregious Because of its Socioeconomic and Racial Targeting of Underdeveloped Areas and Unsuspecting Minorities Communities. 96. One of the most egregious and insidious acts in this case involves J&J and JJCI’s response to growing public health concerns regarding the safety of talcum powder products. In 2006, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (“IARC”), an arm of the World Health Organization, began classifying cosmetic talc such as Baby Powder as possibly carcinogenic.  97. In response to growing scientific scrutiny, J&J failed to take action to warn consumers about health dangers, including the presence of carcinogens and reproductive  1  The outer surface of the skin, the epidermis, along with its outermost layer, the stratum corneum, forms the epidermal barrier.  
COMPLAINT 27 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 toxins in their products. Instead, in an effort to offset potential sale declines due to health concerns, J&J engaged in a concerted effort to expand its customer base by targeting underdeveloped areas and unsuspecting minority communities.  98. There is now documented and indisputable evidence regarding J&J’s socioeconomic and racial targeting. J&J internal documents evidence that in response to public health concerns, J&J specifically target underdeveloped communities and minority groups. 99. Plaintiff is informed and believes that according to a 2006 internal J&J marketing presentation, J&J sought to target “high-propensity consumers.” J&J determined that the “right place” was: “Under developed geographical areas with hot weather, and higher AA population.” The term “AA” – as used in the J&J’s internal presentation – referred to African-Americans. A publicly available excerpt of the marketing presentation is attached at Exhibit C. 100. Plaintiff is informed and believes that J&J concluded that “Powder is still considered a relevant product among AA consumers,” and that “[t]his could be an opportunity.” Plaintiff is further informed and believes that J&J and JJCI similarly targeted Hispanic communities. 101. Shockingly, in the ensuing year, J&J and JJCI turned their marketing strategy into action. Plaintiff is informed and believes that internal company documents reveal J&J and JJCI distributed Baby Powder samples through churches and beauty salons in African-American and Hispanic neighborhoods, ran digital and print promotions with weight-loss and wellness company Weight Watchers, and launched a $300,000 radio advertising campaign in a half-dozen markets aiming to reach “curvy Southern women 18-49 skewing African American.”  102. J&J’s racial targeting has had an undue and tragic impact on unsuspecting minority groups in California, including the African American and Hispanic communities living in California.  
COMPLAINT 28 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 103. In recent months there have been multiple media reports regarding J&J targeting minority groups and women of color in response to mounting health concerns about its talcum powder products. Two of these reports are attached as Exhibits D and E and can be found at https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/johnsonandjohnson-marketing/ and https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/johnson-johnson-baby-powder-1.5092089.   E. The Industry’s Peddling of Talcum Powder Products Has Resulted in a Public Health Crisis in California and the Nation.  104. Talcum powder has been touted and promoted for decades by companies claiming that it helps eliminate friction, is gentle on the skin, and provides a clean, pleasant scent. It has commonly been marketed to unsuspecting mothers for prevention and reduction of babies’ diaper rashes and for use by women as a feminine hygiene product. 105. Tragically, a growing body of evidence has now established that using talc in the genital area can contribute to or cause ovarian cancer. Medical researchers have raised concerns about the safety of talcum powder for many years, and the link between talcum powder and ovarian cancer is now well documented.  1. Early Pathology and Epidemiological Studies in the 1970s and 1980s Identified a Link Between Talcum Powder Use and Gynecological Cancers. 106. In the 1970s, early pathology studies identified talc particles in urogenital tumors. In 1971, for example, researchers published a study discovering particles of talc embedded in ovarian and cervical tumors. See Henderson WJ, Joslin CAF, Turnbull AC, Griffiths K. Talc and carcinoma of the ovary and cervix. J Obstet Gynecol Br Commonw 1971; 78:266–72. 107. In 1982, one of the first epidemiological studies on talcum powder and ovarian cancer was published. This study was conducted by Dr. Daniel Cramer and his colleagues at Harvard School of Public Health and Harvard Medical School. This study found a 92% increased risk in ovarian cancer with women who reported using talcum

The study further found the greatest risk (an increased risk of 228%) occurred in women who regularly used talc on both the perineum and on sanitary napkins. 108. Since 1982, there have been over twenty additional epidemiologic studies providing data regarding the association of talc and ovarian cancer. Nearly all of these studies have reported an elevated risk for ovarian cancer associated with talc use in women. 2. Epidemiological Studies in the 1980s and 1990s Resulted in Public Health Professionals Calling for Warnings Regarding the Potential Risks of Regular Use of Talc. 109. Public health research in the 1980s and 1990s continued to document a causal connection between talcum powder usage and gynecological cancers. The research led public health professionals to call for warnings regarding the potential risks of regular use of talc in the genital area.  110. In 1988, for example, in a case control study of 188 women diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer and 539 control women, researchers at Stanford University School of Medicine found that 52% of the cancer patients habitually used talcum powder on the genital area before their cancer diagnosis. The study showed a 40% increase in risk of ovarian cancer in women that used talcum powder. See Whittemore AS, Wu ML, Paffenbarger RS Jr, Sarles DL, Kampert JB, Grosser S, et al. Personal and environmental characteristics related to epithelial ovarian cancer. II. Exposures to talcum powder, tobacco, alcohol, and coffee. Am J Epidemiol 1988; 128:1228–40. 111. In 1989, researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine studied 235 women diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer and 451 controls. They reported a 100% increased risk in ovarian cancer with women who reported weekly use of talc on the genital area. Booth M, Beral V, Smith P. Risk factors for ovarian cancer: a case–control study. Br J Cancer 1989; 60:592–8. 112. In 1992, researchers at Harvard School of Public Health published results from a case control study that found a statistically significant 50% increase in the risk of ovarian cancer for women using talcum powder. Among women with perineal exposure  
COMPLAINT 30 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 to talc, the risk was significantly elevated in the subgroups of women who applied it: (1) directly as a body powder (70% increase); (2) on a daily basis (80% increased risk); and (3) for more than 10 years (60% increased risk). The greatest ovarian cancer risk associated with perineal talc use was observed in the subgroup of women estimated to have made more than 10,000 applications during years when they were ovulating and had an intact genital tract (180% increased risk). See Harlow BL, Cramer DW, Bell DA, Welch WR. Perineal exposure to talc and ovarian cancer risk. Obstet Gynecol. 1992; 80:19–26. 113. Also, in 1992, in a case-control study, researchers at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health reported a statistically significant 70% increased risk from genital talc use and a 379% increased risk of ovarian cancer of women who used talc on sanitary napkins in their genital area. See Rosenblatt KA, Szklo M, Rosenshein NB. Mineral fiber exposure and the development of ovarian cancer. Gynecol Oncol. 1992;45:20–25. 114. In 1999, researchers at Harvard and Dartmouth-affiliated academic hospitals reported results from a case control study that found a 60% increased risk for ovarian cancer from genital exposure to talcum powder. The study concluded that there was a significant association between the use of talc in genital hygiene and the risk of ovarian cancer that warranted formal public health warnings:  Balanced against what are primarily aesthetic reasons for using talc in genital hygiene, the risk benefit decision is not complex. Appropriate warnings should be provided to women about the potential risks of regular use of talc in the genital area.  See Cramer DW, Liberman RF, Titus-Ernstoff L, Welch WR, Greenberg ER, Baron JA, et al. Genital talc exposure and risk of ovarian cancer. Int J Cancer 1999;81:351–6 (emphasis added).

Research in the 2000s and 2010s continued to document causal connection between talcum powder usage and gynecological cancer, and has resulted in a consensus regarding the carcinogenicity of talc.  116. In 2000, for example, researchers at University of Pennsylvania and University of Miami reported that talc use “on all areas of the body elevated ovarian cancer risk, even after adjustment for potentially important confounding factors.” The study found that the risk for ovarian cancer was significantly elevated among women who applied talc on (1) feet (40% increased risk); (2) genital/rectal area (50% increased risk); (3) sanitary napkins (60% increased risk); and (4) underwear (70% increased risk). See Ness RB, Grisso JA, Cottreau C, Klapper J, Vergona R, Wheeler JE, et al. Factors related to inflammation of the ovarian epithelium and risk of ovarian cancer. Epidemiology 2000;11:111–7.  117. In 2004, researchers at the California Cancer Registry and University of California San Francisco reported a statistically significant 37% increase in risk of ovarian cancer for women who ever used talc in the genital area. Women who were frequent users of talc (4-7 times per week) had the highest increase in risk of ovarian cancer (74% increased risk). See Mills PK, Riordan DG, Cress RD, Young HA. Perineal talc exposure and epithelial ovarian cancer risk in the Central Valley of California. Int J Cancer 2004;112:458–64. 118. In 2008, researchers at the University of Southern California published results from a population-based case-control study in Los Angeles County on the role of talc use and the risk of ovarian cancer. The study reported that ovarian cancer increased significantly with increasing frequency and duration of talc use. Women with long duration (20+ years) and frequent (at least daily) talc exposure had a 108% increased risk for ovarian cancer. Women who were talc users and had a history of endometriosis showed a 212% increased risk for ovarian cancer. See Wu AH, Pearce CL, Tseng CC,

Int J Cancer 2009;124:1409–15. 119. In 2011, researchers at Harvard School of Public Health published the results of a cohort study of 66,028 women on the association between talcum powder use and endometrial cancer in the Nurse’s Health Study. The study found that perineal talcum powder use was associated with a statistically significant 13% increase in endometrial cancer risk among all women, and a statistically significant 21% increase in risk of endometrial cancer among postmenopausal women. See Karageorgi S, Gates MA, Hankinson SE, De Vivo I. Perineal use of talcum powder and endometrial cancer risk. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 2010;19:1269–1275. 120. In 2013, researchers across multiple academic institutions reported results of a pooled study that analyzed the association between genital powder use and epithelial ovarian cancer risk in eight population-based case–control studies. The study reported that genital talcum powder use was associated with a 24% increased risk of epithelial ovarian cancer relative to women who never used powder. Cancer risks were also  elevated for (1) invasive serous tumors (20% increased risk); (2) endometrioid (22% increased risk) and clear cell (24% increased risk) tumors; and (3) for borderline serous tumors (46% increased risk). See Terry KL, Karageorgi S, Shvetsov YB, et al; Australian Cancer Study (Ovarian Cancer); Australian Ovarian Cancer Study Group; Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium.  Genital powder use and risk of ovarian cancer: a pooled analysis of 8525 cases and 9859 controls. Cancer Prev Res. 2013;6(8):811-821. 121. In 2016, researchers at Harvard School of Public Health and Harvard Medical School reported results from a case-control study that found genital talc use was associated with a 33% increased risk of ovarian cancer. The published study confirmed scientific consensus regarding carcinogenicity of talc use:  Multiple studies of ovarian cancer and genital talc use have led only to consensus about possible carcinogenicity.

The association between talc use and ovarian cancer: a retrospective case-control study in two US states.  Epidemiology. 2016;27(3):334-346 (emphasis added). 122. Most recently, on January 7, 2020, researchers at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and multiple academic institutions reported results of a pooled study regarding the association of genital talcum powder use and ovarian cancer. The researchers calculated an 8% increase in the risk of ovarian cancer among talc users. Although this calculation did not reach statistical significance, the study reported a statistically significant 13% increase in risk of cancer among women with patent reproductive tracts (i.e., having an intact uterus and no tubal ligation). For “frequent” use of powder in the genital area with patent reproductive tracts, the study reported a statistically significant 19% increase in the risk of ovarian cancer. See O’Brien  KM, Tworoger  SS, Harris  HR,  et al. Association of powder use in the genital area with risk of ovarian cancer. JAMA [published January 7, 2020]. 123. Despite this scientific evidence, the Industry and Defendants herein marketed talcum powder products as being safe, and they continue to conceal the health risks associated with talc, including the presence of multiple carcinogens and reproductive toxins in talcum powder products. Tragically, the Industry and, more specifically Defendants herein, continue to peddle their products to unsuspecting women (including pregnant women), infants, and children without providing warning that their products result in reproductive toxicity, cancer, and death. F. Following the Service of Plaintiff’s Notices of Violation, Multiple Defendants Announced or Began the Process of Instituting Significant Business Practice Changes 124. Multiple Defendants have now either instituted or are actively in the process of instituting significant business practice changes, including removing offensive products and reformulating talc-containing talcum powder products to a cornstarch formula. Many of these business practice changes were announced or instituted following service of Plaintiff’s Notices of Violation and will contribute a significant public health  
COMPLAINT 34 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 benefit to consumers in California and throughout the United States. The reformulation of talc-containing talcum powder products to a cornstarch formula demonstrates the feasibility of reformulation and injunctive relief.  1. Bausch Has Announced that It has Begun the Process of Reformulating “Shower to Shower” Branded Body Powder Products. 125. On November 6, 2019, approximately six months after Plaintiff served her NOV on Bausch, Bloomberg reported that Bausch had begun the process of reformulating “Shower to Shower” products to replace talc with cornstarch. The planned reformulation of “Shower to Shower” products confers a substantial public health benefit to consumers in California and throughout the country. 126. Despite Bausch beginning the process of instituting business practice changes, in the absence of an injunction issued by this Court, there is a substantial probability Proposition 65 violations will continue to occur. Notably, Bausch has sold and continues to sell offensive products even after the expiration of Plaintiff’s NOV. Similarly, Bausch’s website continued to advertise talc-containing “Shower to Shower” products and provided consumers links to online retailers selling talc-containing “Shower to Shower” products. There is a substantial probability that Bausch will continue the sale of talc-containing body powder products in absence of an injunction. 2. Dollar General Has Begun the Process of Reformulating its DG Branded Baby Powder Product and Instituting Business Practice Changes Related to DG Branded Body Powder Products. 127. Based on investigation of counsel, Plaintiff is informed and believes that Dollar General is in the process of implementing major business practice changes with respect to its private label talcum powder products. These changes involve its baby powder, body powder, and foot powder products identified in Plaintiff’s NOV.  128. Specifically, Dollar General has initiated the process of reformulating its talc-containing DG Baby Powder by replacing talc with cornstarch. On information and belief, and based on investigation of counsel, Dollar General has pulled or is in the  
COMPLAINT 35 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 process of removing “DG” branded body powder products from store shelves. These changes confer a significant benefit to consumers and, in particular, unsuspecting infants and women who otherwise have been placed at heightened risk for cancer and reproductive harm through the use body powder products. 129. Despite Dollar General beginning the process of instituting business practice changes, in absence of an injunction issued by this Court, there is a substantial probability Proposition 65 violations will continue to occur. Notably, Dollar General has sold offensive products even after the expiration of Plaintiff’s NOV and appears to continue to sell “Rexall” branded foot products in California. Moreover, Davion, which supplies talc-containing products at issue to Dollar General, has failed to institute business practice changes and continues to market talcum powder products in California through Dollar General, CVS, and Walgreens. There is substantial probability that Davion and Dollar General will reinstitute the sale of all talcum powder products in the absence of an injunction. 3. Sanofi, Chattem, and Walmart Concede that Gold Bond Products Contain Listed Chemicals Requiring a Proposition 65 Warning. 130. Based on investigation of counsel, certain “Gold Bond” branded body products sold by Walmart on walmart.com now contain the following warning:  WARNING: This product contains chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm. www.p65warnings.ca.gov  The above-warning is provided for Gold Bond Medicated Body Powder and can be found at https://www.walmart.com/ip/Gold-Bond-Body-Powder-Medicated-10-oz/893366.  131. Based on investigation of counsel, the inclusion of the Proposition 65 Warning is limited to Gold Bond Medicated Body Powder products sold on walmart.com. Sanofi, Sanofi US, and Chattem have yet to provide a warning for other Gold Bond products and for products sold through retailers other than Walmart. The inclusion of a Proposition 65 Warning for Gold Bond Medicated Body Powder products sold on 
 
COMPLAINT 36 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 walmart.com further demonstrates Sanofi, Sanofi US, Chattem, and Walmart’s knowledge regarding the presence of Proposition 65 chemicals in talcum powder products. V. TOLLING OF THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS A. Continuing Violation Doctrine 132. Any applicable statute of limitation is suspended by the continuing violations doctrine. The doctrine’s key issue is whether the conduct complained of constitutes a continuing pattern and course of conduct. If there is a pattern, then the suit is timely so long as the action is filed within the limitation period applicable to the most recent violation, and the entire course of conduct is at issue. Komarova v. Nat’l Credit Acceptance, Inc., 175 CA4th 324, 344 (2009) (repeated telephone calls in violation of debt collection law was clearly a continuing course of conduct because the violation occurs only through repetition); see also Richards v. CH2M Hill, Inc., 26 Cal.4th 798, 823 (2001); Jumaane v. City of L.A., 241 Cal.App.4th 1390, 1402 (2015). 133. The Defendants’ conduct as alleged herein constitutes a continuing pattern and course of conduct that has occurred through repetition. Defendants engaged in an ongoing continuing pattern of conduct that includes repeated and continuous (1) manufacturing, distributing, marketing, and selling of talcum powder products that contain Listed Chemicals; (2) utilizing the Industry definition and specification for talc; and (3) knowingly and intentionally failing to disclose the presence of Listed Chemicals to consumers and the general public. B. Fraudulent Concealment 134. Defendants had a duty to warn consumers or disclose facts related to the presence of Listed Chemicals in talcum powder products. For many years, however, Defendants have concealed facts related to the presence of Listed Chemicals in talcum powder products from the general public. As discussed herein, Defendants knowingly and intentionally failed to warn consumers and to disclose certain facts that were known only to them and that consumers and the general public could not have discovered.   
COMPLAINT 37 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 135. Alternatively, Defendants disclosed some facts related to ingredients in their talcum powder products containing “talc,” but intentionally failed to disclose to consumers and the general public facts related Defendants’ definition of “talc” or the presence of Listed Chemicals, making the disclosure deceptive. 136. Consumers and the general public are unaware of the facts concealed by Defendants, and Defendants have intended to deceive consumers and the general public. The facts concealed by Defendants (i.e., the presence of carcinogens and reproductive toxins) are of the type that would be relied upon and acted upon by consumers, the general public, and California regulators. Had the omitted information been disclosed, consumers and the general public would have reasonably behaved differently by not purchasing Defendants’ talcum powder products. Similarly, California regulators would have behaved differently by taking steps to address the violations herein or requiring the removal of the products at issue from the market.  137. Defendants’ conduct has caused substantial harm to consumers and the general public. Consumers and the general public have been harmed by virtue of purchasing countless talcum powder products that contain Listed Chemicals, and Defendants’ conduct has caused a public health tragedy. 138. Defendants’ failure to disclose has been with a profiteering motive, knowing the full disclosure would lead to significant loss in sales and the likely removal of talcum powder products from the market. 1. Defendants’ Activities Were Inherently Self-Concealing. 139. Defendants concealed facts related to the presence of Listed Chemicals in talcum powder products from consumers and the general public. Such facts are not readily available to consumers and the general public. The Industry’s and Defendants’ conduct of hiding the presence of multiple carcinogens and reproductive toxins with the Industry definition of “talc” is the quintessential example of an activity that is inherently self-concealing.  
COMPLAINT 38 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 140. Discovery of the concealed facts would require consumers and the general public to conduct significant scientific testing to determine the presence of several undisclosed and unknown carcinogens and reproductive toxins. Consumers and the general public would also be required to engage in substantial guess-work regarding the identity of the specific carcinogens and reproductive toxins at issue. The required scientific testing is cost-prohibitive and not generally available to consumers at or prior to the point of purchase.  141. As a result of the inherently self-concealing conduct of hiding the presence of multiple Listed Chemicals, consumers of ordinary ability or intelligence could not have discovered, or with reasonable diligence, could not have discovered Defendants’ concealment. 2. In Addition to Engaging in Inherently Self-Concealing Conduct, Defendants Engaged in a Concerted Strategy of Providing Potentially Plausible (But Deceptive) Disclosures Regarding Ingredients in their Products. 142. As discussed more fully above, all Defendants herein disclosed the presence of “talc” as an ingredient in their talcum powder products. The disclosure of “talc” as in ingredient creates a potentially plausible (but in fact misleading) impression that the products at issue herein contain pure talc. Defendants, however, failed to disclose the term “talc” as used by the Industry is a highly manipulated and defined term that is designed to conceal the presence of multiple carcinogens and reproductive toxins in the products at issue herein. 143. Defendants failed to disclose multiple facts regarding the Industry definition of “talc” to consumers and the general public. Without limitation, such omitted facts include: • that the term “talc” is merely defined to mean white, odorless, fine powder that is ground from naturally occurring rock ore that consists of a minimum of 90% hydrated magnesium silicate;   • that the remaining 10% consists of “naturally associated minerals;”  • that multiple carcinogens and reproductive toxins are commonly found in talcum powder products;   
COMPLAINT 39 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  • that the Industry specification for talc expressly includes arsenic (up to 3 ppm) and lead (up to 20 ppm lead); and  • that other “naturally associated minerals” commonly found in talcum powder products commonly include hexavalent chromium.  144. Defendants intentionally failed to make a full disclosure of facts related to the Industry definition of “talc” and the presence of Listed Chemicals to consumers and the general public, making Defendants’ ingredients disclosure misleading and deceptive. VI. STATUTORY BACKGROUND 145. The Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 is an initiative statute passed as “Proposition 65” by a vote of the people in November 1986. The warning requirement of Proposition 65 is contained in Health and Safety Code section 25249.6, which provides:  No person in the course of doing business shall knowingly and intentionally expose any individual to a chemical known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity without first giving clear and reasonable warning to such individual, except as provided in Section 25249.10. 146. An exposure to a chemical in a consumer product is “an exposure that results from a person’s acquisition, purchase, storage, consumption, or any reasonably foreseeable use of a consumer product, including consumption of a food.” (27 CCR § 25600.1 (emphasis added)).   147. Proposition 65 establishes a procedure by which the State is to develop a list of chemicals “known to the State to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity.” (Health & Saf. Code, § 25249.8.) No warning need be given concerning a listed chemical until one year after the chemical first appears on the list. (Health & Saf. Code, § 25249.10(b).) 148. Proposition 65’s warning requirements apply to products that are marketed via the internet or catalogs (online or printed). (27 CCR §§ 25600.1(a), (b).) For items marketed on the internet, the website must include either the warning or a clearly-marked hyperlink using the word “WARNING” on the product display page, or by otherwise  
COMPLAINT 40 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 prominently displaying the warning to the purchaser prior to completing the purchase. (27 CCR § 25600.1(a).) A warning is not prominently displayed if the purchaser must search for it in the general content of the website. Id. For catalogs, warnings must be clearly associated with corresponding products. (27 CCR § 25600.1(a).) 149. The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (“OEHHA”) has provided guidance on how internet retailers can comply with the internet or catalog regulations. OEHHA has clarified that online and catalog warnings must be provided even if the product is already labeled with a warning.  Even out-of-state internet retailers are required to provide a separate internet warning in addition to any warning that is placed on a product. 150. To guide businesses in determining whether a warning is necessary or whether discharges of a chemical into drinking water sources are prohibited, OEHHA has developed safe harbor levels. A business has “safe harbor” from Proposition 65 warning requirements or discharge prohibitions if exposure to a chemical occurs at or below these levels. These safe harbor levels consist of No Significant Risk Levels (“NSRL”) for chemicals listed as causing cancer and Maximum Allowable Dose Levels (“MADL”) for chemicals listed as causing birth defects or other reproductive harm. The burden is on businesses to show that exposure levels are below NSRL and MADL levels. (Health & Saf. Code, § 25249.10(c).) 151. If there is no safe harbor level for a chemical, businesses that expose individuals to that chemical would be required to provide a Proposition 65 warning, unless the business can show that the anticipated exposure level will not pose a significant risk of cancer or reproductive harm. OEHHA has adopted regulations that provide guidance for calculating a level in the absence of a safe harbor level. The Regulations are available to businesses, including Defendants herein, at Article 7 and Article 8 of Title 27, California Code of Regulations. 152. Any person “violating or threatening to violate” the statute may be enjoined in any court of competent jurisdiction. (Health & Saf. Code, § 25249.7.) To “threaten to

Code § 25249.11(e).) In addition, violators are liable for civil penalties of up to $2,500 per day for each violation, recoverable in a civil action. (Health & Saf. Code § 25249.7(b).) 153. Private parties are given authority to enforce Proposition 65 “in the public interest” if the private party first provides written notice of a violation to the alleged violator, the Attorney General, and every District Attorney in whose jurisdiction the alleged violation occurs. If no public prosecutors commence enforcement within sixty days, the private party may sue. (Health & Saf. Code, § 25249.7(d).) VII. DEFENDANTS’ VIOLATION OF PROPOSITION 65 A. Listed Chemicals in Talcum Powder Products 1. Arsenic 154. Inorganic arsenic oxides are known to be reproductive toxins based on sufficient scientific evidence. See Evidence on Developmental and Reproductive Toxicity of Arsenic (OEHHA, 1996), available at https://oehha.ca.gov/media/downloads/proposition-65/chemicals/hid.pdf. In utero exposure to inorganic arsenic has been linked to high levels and increases in mortality from cancer, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disease. See, e.g., Farzan SF, Karagas MR, Chen Y. In utero and early life arsenic exposure in relation to long-term health and disease. Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2013;272:384–390, available at  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3783578/.  155.  “Arsenic (inorganic oxides)” was placed on the Governor’s list of chemicals known to the State of California to cause reproductive toxicity on May 1, 1997. It is specifically identified under “developmental reproductive toxicity,” which means harm to the developing fetus.  2. Hexavalent Chromium 156. Chromium hexavalent compounds are known to be human carcinogens based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity from studies in humans. Epidemiological  
COMPLAINT 42 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 studies in various geographical locations have consistently reported increased risks of lung cancer associated with chromium hexavalent compounds. See National Toxicology Program, Chromium Hexavalent Compounds, Report on Carcinogens, Fourteenth Edition, available at https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/roc/content/profiles/chromiumhexavalentcompounds.pdf.   157. Chromium hexavalent compounds are known to be reproductive toxins based on sufficient scientific evidence. See Evidence on the Developmental and Reproductive Toxicity of Chromium (hexavalent compounds) (OEHHA, 2009). Infants exposed to chromium hexavalent compounds in utero have significantly higher risk for a group of chromosomal anomalies, elevated risk for genitourinary anomalies, endometriosis, menstrual irregularities, ovarian cysts, reproductive neoplasms, and cancers. See, e.g., Remy, L.L., Byers, V. & Clay, T. Reproductive outcomes after non-occupational exposure to hexavalent chromium, Willits California, 1983-2014. Environ Health 16, 18 (2017) doi:10.1186/s12940-017-0222-8, available at https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-017-0222-8.  158. “Chromium (hexavalent compounds)” was placed on the Governor’s list of chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer on October 27, 1992. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 27, § 27001(b).) 159. “Chromium (hexavalent compounds)” was placed on the Governor’s list of chemicals known to the State of California to cause reproductive toxicity on December 19, 2008. It is specifically identified under three subcategories: (1) “developmental reproductive toxicity,” which means harm to the developing fetus; (2) “female reproductive toxicity,” which means harm to the female reproductive system, and (3) “male reproductive toxicity,” which means harm to the male reproductive system.

Moreover, Chattem has operated under the Sanofi corporate identity since at least 2017. In fact, Sanofi appears to have renamed Chattem to Sanofi. As part of this process, Sanofi has literally ripped out the “Chattem” sign at the company’s headquarters and replaced it with a new sign identifying the company as “Sanofi.” Sanofi has similarly morphed its corporate identity into the Gold Bond brand by placing the “Sanofi” logo on Gold Bond’s website.

Agency, Joint Operator Allegations, and Alter Ego Allegations (1) Personal Care Products’ History of Failure to Comply with Corporate or Limited Liability Company Formalities 273. Personal Care Products’ business dates back to 1983. Throughout its history, Personal Care Products and its predecessor companies have failed to comply with the most basic tenets of corporate formality. The current and prior controlling members of Personal Care Products have a history of operating shells or phantom companies and engaging in abusive transfers of assets and goodwill of the business to closely held and affiliated business entities.  274. Based on investigation of counsel, current and prior controlling members of Personal Care Products have engaged in a continuing pattern of abuse of corporate formalities. The abusive pattern has involved the (1) the registration of a shell business operation; (2) transferring assets and goodwill of the business to a new entity; and (3) shutting down prior operations.3    3  Based on investigation of counsel, such entities involved in the chain of business include: (1) American Household Products, Inc.; (2) Personal Care Products, Inc.; (3) Personal Care Products, LLC; (4) GL 360, LLC; and (5) Greenlite 360, LLC.  
COMPLAINT 74 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 275. As discussed in more detail below, since late 2017, Stone Arch – the current majority and controlling member of Personal Care Products – has operated the company as a mere instrumentality, while conducting business through shell businesses identified as “GL 360, LLC” and “Greenlite 360, LLC.” Based on investigation of counsel, “GL 360, LLC” and “Greenlite 360, LLC” were never formally registered as limited liability companies in any of the fifty states.  276. Most recently, following Plaintiff’s service of her Notice of Violation (“NOV”) on Walmart and Personal Care Products, the controlling member of Personal Care Products has continued to engage in a pattern of conduct that fails to comply with basic corporate formalities. This failure has manifested itself through an orchestrated shutdown of Personal Care Products.  277. On September 26, 2019, counsel for Personal Care Products sent an email to counsel for Walmart and counsel for Plaintiff indicating that his client would go out of business the next day and would no longer “participate” in the matter. The email provides in pertinent part: I wish to inform you and all the other counsel that my client Personal Care products will be closing their business tomorrow and will no longer be involved in this matter for their company or to participate in this matter with Walmart. Please remove our firm from your circulation list. 278. Despite counsel’s representation that Personal Care Products would go out of business on September 27, 2019, Personal Care Products has been unable to provide a certificate of cancellation or similar secretary of state filing that reflects that the company has been formally cancelled or dissolved. As of the filing of this Complaint, Personal Care Products and affiliated phantom entities continue to remain in business.  279. On information and belief, and based on investigation of counsel, the controlling owners have taken steps to or plan to conduct Personal Care Products’ business through shell entities or phantom companies that have yet to be registered.  
COMPLAINT 75 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 280. More disturbingly, Plaintiff is also informed and believes that Personal Care Products and Stone Arch have knowingly failed to institute a litigation hold and do not plan to retain documents.  (2) Stone Arch’s Control and Operation of Phantom Business Entities 281. Stone Arch is a joint operator of Personal Care Products and other related businesses. Since approximately December 2017, Stone Arch has operated or allowed the operation of phantom companies. Stone Arch has specifically operated or allowed the operation of phantom companies for importing talcum powder products and various “Equate” branded personal care products sold by Walmart. 282. Prior to December 2017, Stone Arch’s website specifically identified “Personal Care Products, LLC” as a portfolio company and described the business as follows: Personal Care Products, LLC Personal Care Products, LLC (“PCP” or the “Company”), headquartered in Bingham Farms, MI, is a leading supplier of value branded and private label health, beauty and household care products. The Company provides a broad portfolio of over 350 products across four categories: 1) health and beauty products, which include hand sanitizers, shampoos & conditioners, shave & hair removal, lotions & creams, soaps and deodorants sold under the “Personal Care Products” brand, 2) household cleaning products, which include air fresheners, aerosol cleaners, liquid cleaners, and carpet care, dish care and toilet care products sold under the “Powerhouse” brand, 3) cooking sprays sold under the “Healthy Way” brand, and 4) select private label products.

In or about December 2017 or January 2018, Stone Arch suddenly and inexplicably removed references to “Personal Care Products, LLC” from its website and began identifying “Greenlite 360, LLC” as a portfolio company. Stone Arch’s website described the “Greenlite 360, LLC” business as follows: Greenlite 360, LLC Greenlite 360, LLC (“GL360” or the “Company”), headquartered in Troy, Michigan and was founded in 1983. Greenlite 360 is a leading supplier of private label and branded solutions within the health & beauty and household products segments.

For more complete information, please visit the Company’s website at http://www.gl360.com/.   284. Plaintiff is informed and believes that Stone Arch has used its “Greenlite 360, LLC” portfolio company as a vehicle to import talcum powder and “Equate” branded personal care products. 285. In addition to the foregoing, since approximately December 2017, Stone Arch has operated or allowed Personal Care Products to operate as “GL 360, LLC.” Plaintiff is informed and believes that Stone Arch has also used or allowed the use of the “GL 360, LLC” business entity as a vehicle to import talcum powder and “Equate” branded personal care products. 286. Both “Greenlite 360, LLC” and “GL 360, LLC” are phantom companies that do not exist. Based on investigation of counsel, neither “GL 360, LLC” nor “GL 360, LLC” has been registered as a limited liability company in any of the fifty states.   
COMPLAINT 77 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 287. Because Stone Arch has operated or allowed the operation of phantom companies to import talcum powder and “Equate” branded personal care products for Walmart, Stone Arch is directly liable in this action. Stone Arch is not entitled to the protections of corporate or limited liability company shields.  (3) Stone Arch’s Failure to Comply with Corporate or Limited Liability Company Formalities 288. In addition to the foregoing, Stone Arch has failed to comply with corporate formalities. As set forth in more detail below, Stone Arch’s failures in this regard include, but are not limited to:  • Making a substantial investment in Personal Care Products and subsequently allowing its prior owner to convert Personal Care Products into a personal holding company;  • Operating or permitting the operation of Personal Care Products as a mere instrumentality;  • Permitting business operations through shell businesses identified as “GL 360, LLC” and “Greenlite 360, LLC.”  • Holding out “Greenlite 360, LLC” as a portfolio company;  • Importing or permitting the import of talcum powder and “Equate” branded personal care products through “Greenlite 360, LLC;”  • In the months prior to the threatened shutdown of Personal Care Products, allowing the import of a significant amount of talc through “GL 360, LLC,” so as to allow for continued operations;   • Threatening to shut down Personal Care Products following Plaintiff’s service of NOVs at issue herein; and  • Taking steps or allowing the key employees of Personal Care Products to take steps for continued business operations following the shutdown of Personal Care Products. 289. In addition, Plaintiff is informed and believes that Stone Arch has taken steps to or has allowed the key employees of Personal Care Products to take steps to

XHIBIT D As worries about Baby Powder's safetymounted, J&J focused its pitches onminority, overweight women
The company sought for decades to shore up weakening sales ofits iconic talc with ads aimed at speciﬁc types of women – manyof the same types who today are among those alleging inthousands of lawsuits that J&J powder caused their cancers.By CHRIS KIRKHAM and LISA GIRION Filed April 9, 2019, 1 p.m. GMTLOS ANGELES - Pressure was mounting on Johnson & Johnson and its signatureBaby Powder.  In 2006, an arm of the World Health Organization began classifying cosmetic talcsuch as Baby Powder as “possibly carcinogenic” when women used it as a genitalantiperspirant and deodorant, as many had been doing for years. Talc supplierLuzenac America Inc started including that information on its shipments to J&J andother customers.J&J, meanwhile, looked for ways to sell more Baby Powder to two key groups oflongtime users: African-American and overweight women. The “right place” tofocus, according to a 2006 internal J&J marketing presentation, was “underdeveloped geographical areas with hot weather, and higher AA population,” the“AA” referring to African-Americans.“Powder is still considered a relevant product among AA consumers,” thepresentation said. “This could be an opportunity.”  
HOUSEHOLD STAPLE: Krystal Kim says she put Baby Powder “everywhere” a!er showering when she was growing up. She is among 22 plainti"s to whom a St. Louis jury awarded$4.69 billion last year in a lawsuit alleging J&J talc caused their ovarian cancer. REUTERS/Mark Makela
In the following years, J&J turned those proposals into action, internal companydocuments show. It distributed Baby Powder samples through churches and beautysalons in African-American and Hispanic neighborhoods, ran digital and printpromotions with weight-loss and wellness company Weight Watchers and launcheda $300,000 radio advertising campaign in a half-dozen markets aiming to reach“curvy Southern women 18-49 skewing African American.”These are only some of the more recent examples of J&J’s decades-long efforts tooffset declining Baby Powder sales amid rising concern about the health effects oftalc, based on a Reuters review of years of J&J print, radio and digital advertisingcampaigns and thousands of pages of internal marketing documents and emailcorrespondence.
!Adults have been the main users of Johnson’s Baby Powder since at least the 1970s,after pediatricians started warning of the danger to infants of inhaling talc. Asadults became ever more crucial to the brand – accounting for 91 percent of BabyPowder use by the mid-2000s – J&J honed its powder pitches to court a variety oftargeted markets, from teen-focused ads touting the product’s “fresh and natural”qualities, to promotions aimed at older minority and overweight women.Today, women who fall into those categories make up a large number of the 13,000plaintiffs alleging that J&J’s Baby Powder and Shower to Shower, a powder brandthe company sold off in 2012, caused their ovarian cancer or mesothelioma.Many of the ovarian cancer lawsuits have blamed the disease on perineal use of J&Jcosmetic talcs – a claim supported by some studies showing an association betweensuch use and increased cancer risk. The most recent cases have alleged that J&J’stalc products contained asbestos, long a known carcinogen.In an investigation published Dec. 14, Reuters revealed that J&J knew for decadesthat small amounts of asbestos had occasionally been found in its raw talc and inBaby Powder and Shower to Shower, based on test results from the early 1970s tothe early 2000s – information it did not disclose to regulators or the public.J&J challenged the findings of the Reuters report, describing them as inaccurateand misleading.Krystal Kim, a 53-year-old African-American, was one of 22 plaintiffs whose case inSt. Louis resulted in a jury verdict last summer of $4.69 billion against J&J. Kimsaid Baby Powder and Shower to Shower were household staples among her familyand friends when she was growing up in New Jersey.

A!er damaging Reuters report, J&J doubles down on talcsafety message“Every time I took a shower, I put Baby Powder on,” recalled Kim, whose ovariancancer, first diagnosed in 2014, is now in remission. “I put it on my panties, on myclothes, everywhere.”J&J is appealing the St. Louis verdict. The company did not respond to requests foran interview with Chief Executive Officer Alex Gorsky or any other executive todiscuss the company’s marketing of cosmetic powders.In an emailed response to questions from Reuters, J&J said its Baby Powder is safeand asbestos-free. It noted that the company’s marketing over the years has beendirected at many demographics and groups, and that “we’re proud pioneers of thepractice of multicultural marketing.” It also pointed out that some Baby Powder adshave featured the cornstarch version of Baby Powder, the safety of which isn’tquestioned.Reports by Bloomberg News, the New York Times and the Post and Courier ofCharleston, South Carolina, have cited some internal J&J documents revealing thecompany’s focus on African-American and overweight women at certain times. Butthe full timeline and scale of the marketing efforts, particularly those aimed atteenage girls, in minority communities and through organizations such as WeightWatchers, are reported here for the first time.Most businesses know the demographic profiles of those who buy their productsand, as a matter of course, direct their marketing at those groups. Some – fast-foodcompanies and soft-drink makers, for example – have courted minority customersto increase sales among heavy users at times of growing public concern about thepossible health effects of their products.In a lawsuit filed in Mississippi state court in 2014, Mississippi Attorney GeneralJim Hood alleges that J&J failed to warn consumers of the risks associated with itstalc products and accuses the company of implementing a “racially targetedstrategy” for selling Baby Powder after J&J became aware of health concerns. Thecompany focused its marketing on “minority communities expected to be morelikely to use the talc products,” Hood claims in the lawsuit.

J&J denied the allegations and last year filed a motion for summary judgment in thesuit, arguing that the case involved matters of federal law, beyond the state’spurview. A judge in December denied J&J’s motion, a move the company hasappealed. The case is scheduled for trial later this year.
!In its response to Reuters’ questions, J&J said: “Suggesting that Johnson & Johnsontargeted a particular group with a potentially harmful product is incredibly offensiveand patently false.”“Deep, personal trust”Sold continuously since 1894, Johnson’s Baby Powder accounted for less than 1percent of J&J’s $81.6 billion in revenue last year, but it is deemed critical to thecompany’s family-friendly image. An internal J&J marketing presentation from1999 refers to the baby products division, with Baby Powder at the core, as J&J’s“#1 Asset,” grounded in “deep, personal trust.”Beginning in the 1950s, however, a series of case studies published in medicaljournals pointed to the dangers of breathing in talc. Pediatricians took notice. By thelate 1950s, a third of them were recommending cornstarch or oil to treat diaper rashand chafing “because there is no dangerous dust” in them, according to an internalJ&J report.A report in the June 1966 edition of the American Journal of Diseases of Children,citing the deaths of three children who inhaled large amounts of talcum powder,concluded there was “no justification” for using the product on babies because it has“no medicinal value.”By 1974, more than 60 percent of Johnson’s Baby Powder sales were “attributable toadults” who used it on themselves, according to a J&J analysis.Losing the connection to the product’s namesake – babies – left J&J eager tocultivate other markets.Beginning in the 1970s, J&J ran ads clearly intended to woo young women, inaddition to its traditional marketing aimed at families with babies. “You start beingsexy when you stop trying,” was the line from an ad that appeared in Seventeenmagazine in 1972. The photo shows a young woman stroking a young man’s curlyblond hair.“It’s a feeling you never outgrow,” is how an ad in Family Circle magazine from themid-1980s put it, with a photo of a bottle of Baby Powder next to a teddy bearalongside the mirrored reflection of a young woman.NOT JUST BABIES: In the 1970s, as adults became the main users of Baby Powder, J&J courted young women withads like these that appeared in Seventeen magazine in 1972.
In 1989, advertising firm Young & Rubicam submitted a plan to J&J to “initiate ahigh level of usage” among young women to “augment the weakening baby link.”Under the plan, ads in style magazines like Seventeen, YM, Glamour andMademoiselle would try to convince teen girls that Johnson’s Baby Powder,“applied daily after showering, is a simple, feminine way to smell clean and freshduring the day.” Young & Rubicam, now known as VMLY&R, declined to commenton the document and referred questions to J&J.Baby Powder sales continued to fall throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. Sincehealth professionals had already recommended against using talc on infants, a 1986internal report warned, a “last straw” safety concern could lead consumers toabandon the product altogether.  As early as 1992, the company keyed in on the sales potential with minority women.A J&J memo that year mentions “high usage” rates for Baby Powder of 52 percentamong African-Americans and 37.6 percent among Hispanic customers – and notesthat women of both ethnicities use the product more than the general population.The memo suggests investigating “ethnic (African American/Hispanic)opportunities to grow the franchise,” while referring to “negative publicity from thehealth community on talc,” including “inhalation, dust, negative doctorendorsement, cancer linkage.” Portions of that memo were cited in reports fromBloomberg and the New York Times.“Powder is still considered a relevant product among AAconsumers. This could be an opportunity.”Internal J&J marketing presentation
!By 2006, the company was recognizing that “consumers do not see a need forpowder,” according to a sales presentation that year. Baby Powder shipments hadbeen “stagnating” in recent years, the presentation said, and it was essential to “finda new business model” that “strategically and efficiently targets high propensityconsumers.”Those groups, according to the presentation: African-Americans, nearly 60 percentof whom used Baby Powder by this time, compared to about 30 percent for theoverall population; overweight people; and fitness-conscious people looking to loseweight.It was also in 2006 that the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), anarm of the World Health Organization, classified perineal use of talc as “possiblycarcinogenic,” saying available research provided “limited evidence” it causedcancer in humans. That came about 20 years after IARC classified “talc containingasbestiform fibres” as “carcinogenic to humans,” its highest-risk classification.
CORE CUSTOMERS: J&J’s marketing of Baby Powderthrough ads like this from the early 1980s reflect thehistorically strong popularity of the product amongAfrican-Americans.
After the IARC’s 2006 move, talc supplier Luzenac Americastarted including a note about the agency’s latest classificationon a chemical safety document accompanying shipments to allcustomers, including J&J. Under a heading that reads“carcinogenic status,” the document says IARC “has concludedthat perineal use of talc-based body powder is possiblycarcinogenic to humans.”In a deposition for one of the ovarian cancer cases tried in St.Louis, a Luzenac America executive, Shripal Sharma, said thecompany felt it was important to add what he referred to as awarning to the safety document. Asked whether Luzenac knewthat J&J did not pass on this warning, Sharma said: “It is notour job to tell our customers what to do with their products.”In a statement to Reuters, Imerys Talc America Inc, as Luzenacis now known, said: “Talc’s safe use has been confirmed bymultiple regulatory and scientific bodies,” echoing J&J’sresponse.Through an Imerys spokeswoman, Sharma declined tocomment.Two years after the IARC classification, J&J sought proposalsfor an “African American agency” to develop marketing campaigns for thecompany’s baby products line. A 2008 document sent to prospective agenciessummed up the situation: “Johnson’s Baby Oil and Baby Powder products, whiletraditionally used only on babies, are today primarily consumed by adult AA womenfor use on themselves.” One way to reverse the brand’s decline, it said, was by“speaking to AA consumers with a more relevant message with the most effectivemedia vehicles.”“Ethnic consumers”
!That year, the company contracted with a North Carolina marketing firm,Segmented Marketing Services Inc, which says it specializes in targeted promotionsto “ethnic consumers.” The firm would distribute 100,000 gift bags containing BabyPowder and other Johnson’s baby products in African-American and Hispanicneighborhoods in Chicago, according to a contract with J&J.Run by African-Americans who had been executives at Procter & Gamble Co andQuaker Oats, Segmented Marketing Services has said in past press releases and itsown marketing publications that it hands out millions of free product samples andpromotional offers through national networks of more than 10,000 African-American and Hispanic churches, and tens of thousands of “beauty salons, barbershops, entertainment venues and healthcare networks.”The company published an advertorial in 2008 prepared for distribution withJohnson’s baby products in which the firm’s founders, Sandra Miller Jones andLafayette Jones, said they “welcome” J&J as a partner.“When caring rituals started in infancy continue through adulthood, a person’s self-confidence and even faith in the world are often strengthened,” the pamphlet said.“Whether in the gym, at work, at church or at the beach, Johnson’s Baby Powderhelps grown-ups feel more comfortable in their own skin.” It came with a couponfor $1 off Baby Powder.
THE RIGHT STUFF: An internal J&J marketing presentation suggests that Baby Powder marketing focus on African-Americans in hot climates.
Lafayette Jones and Sandra Miller Jones did not respond to calls, emails andLinkedIn messages seeking comment.J&J also launched campaigns to boost sales of Baby Powder to “curvy Southernwomen” and athletic adults who want to smell fresh, according to companydocuments. It advertised in Weight Watchers magazine and offered promotions
!through the Lane Bryant clothing chain for plus-size women and Curves, a women’sfitness and weight-loss franchise. Marketing plans also included ads to run inSouthern Living magazine and during the Style Network show “Ruby,” a reality TVseries that documented an obese Georgia woman on a mission to lose weight.A 2009 presentation laying out the “Powder media plan” highlights that it will reach31 million people “in the South (hot climates/overweight states),” and that “43% ofour plan will focus on the top 10 overweight states in the nation.”A 2009 ad in Weight Watchers magazine suggests readers “bust stress with amidday workout” and then “stay fresh post-exercise by applying Johnson’s BabyPowder.”Internal J&J marketing emails before the Weight Watchers campaign ran discusswhether the women featured are heavy enough to resonate with the intendedaudience. “Can you ask WW if they have any images of slightly bigger women? Theydon’t have to be super curvy, but a little bigger than the current image would bepreferable,” wrote Grace Lee, a J&J brand manager, to others at the company andad agency Lowe New York.Weight Watchers, now known officially as WW International Inc, declined tocomment on the campaign. Lee & Interpublic Group of Companies Inc, which ownsthe former Lowe New York, didn’t respond to requests for comment.
GOING REGIONAL: Ads like these in Weight Watchers magazine were part of a campaign a decade ago in which J&Jtargeted “curvy Southern women. ”
The Weight Watchers campaign was successful, according to a 2009 internal J&Jrecap, which showed that sales of Baby Powder at Wal-Mart shot up as much as 9percent during the summer months when the ads ran from the same months a yearearlier, reversing a decline.
!J&J’s overall Baby Powder media advertising budget increased to a proposed$495,000 for 2010, up 71 percent from $288,000 in 2009, driven by morededicated spending toward promotions for overweight women.The company in 2010 launched a radio campaign in the South targeting “CurvySouthern Women 18-49 Skewing African American.” A presentation from TMPG, amarketing agency that handles promotions with radio DJs, said the campaign mademore than 18 million impressions on the target audience through ads andpromotions on “urban adult contemporary” radio stations in Southern markets,including Dallas; Atlanta; Nashville; Mobile, Alabama; and Jackson, Mississippi.The presentation slides feature some photos of plus-size African-American womenholding Baby Powder samples at “targeted station events” that also included spagiveaways and “Baby Powder Stay Cool Cash.” TMPG did not respond to requestsfor comment.In a 2010 email, Debra DeStasio, a J&J promotions and marketing manager whooversaw the baby products line at the time, gave the green light to two proposedradio stations for the campaign in Dallas, saying “we are good with those generalmarket stations that have good Hispanic reach and good AA reach.” In another 2010email, she said the DJs will be the Baby Powder “brand ambassadors,” charged with“communicating our message, encouraging listeners to call in to talk about how theyuse Baby Powder and driving to retail where appropriate.”
PUBLIC OUTREACH: J&J promoted Baby Powder with coupons and other giveaways at radio-station events as part ofa 2010 campaign to reach “Curvy Southern Women 18-49 Skewing African American, ” as shown in this presentationslide from marketing agency TMPG.
All the radio promotions would be “based on the weather,” she wrote. “If it’s hot andhumid, we’ll run that week. If it’s rainy or colder, we won’t.”DeStasio, who now works as a promotions and marketing manager at Bristol-MyersSquibb Co, did not respond to requests for comment.
!J&J’s spending on Baby Powder promotions – coupons, discounts, and samples –came to about $1.2 million in 2008 and again in 2010, almost half of it directed atoverweight and minority women. By 2011, the company cut back its promotionalspending to $752,000, mostly aimed at the general consumer market.In 2013, a jury found J&J negligent in the first case ever to claim that regular use ofBaby Powder for feminine hygiene caused ovarian cancer. The jury didn’t awardmonetary damages, but the verdict spawned a cascade of similar lawsuits.Of the eight ovarian cancer cases that have gone to trial so far, four have resulted inverdicts for plaintiffs and one for the company. Three other verdicts against J&Jwere overturned on appeal.In 12 trials of cases claiming that asbestos in talc caused plaintiffs’ mesothelioma,J&J was cleared of liability in five, and plaintiffs won three, resulting in a total of$172 million in damages. Four others resulted in hung juries and mistrials.J&J is appealing all the verdicts against it.REUTERS INVESTIGATES

In its most recent newsletter, the National Councilof Negro Women, a women’s leadership group with about 30,000 members, drewattention to the issue with an essay penned by civil-rights lawyer Ben Crump, who isrepresenting some Baby Powder plaintiffs.In an interview, Janice Mathis, the council’s executive director, said: “Lots ofproducts target African-Americans.

In 2006, an arm of the World Health Organization began classifying cosmetic talc such asBaby Powder as possibly carcinogenic when women used it as a genital antiperspirant anddeodorant, as many had been doing for years. Talc supplier Luzenac America Inc startedincluding that information on its shipments to J&J and other customers.J&J, meanwhile, looked for ways to sell more Baby Powder to two key groups of longtimeusers: African-American and overweight women. The "right place" to focus, according to a2006 internal J&J marketing presentation, was "under developed geographical areas with hotweather, and higher AA population," referring to African-Americans."Powder is still considered a relevant product among AA consumers," the presentation said."This could be an opportunity."Johnson & Johnson ordered to pay $55M to family in cancer-talcum powder caseIn the following years, J&J turned those proposals into action, internal company documentsshow. It distributed Baby Powder samples through churches and beauty salons in African-American and Hispanic neighborhoods, ran digital and print promotions with weight-lossand wellness company Weight Watchers and launched a $300,000 US radio advertisingcampaign in a half-dozen markets aiming to reach "curvy Southern women 18-49 skewingAfrican American."These are only some of the more recent examples of J&J's decades-long efforts to offsetdeclining Baby Powder sales amid rising concern about the health effects of talc, based on aReuters review of years of J&J print, radio and digital advertising campaigns and thousandsof pages of internal marketing documents and email correspondence.Adults have been the main users of Johnson's Baby Powder since at least the 1970s, afterpediatricians started warning of the danger to infants of inhaling talc. As adults became evermore crucial to the brand – accounting for 91 percent of Baby Powder use by the mid-2000s — J&J honed its powder pitches to court a variety of targeted markets, from teen-focused ads touting the product's "fresh and natural" qualities, to promotions aimed atolder minority and overweight women.Today, women who fall into those categories make up a large number of the 13,000 plaintiffsalleging that J&J's Baby Powder and Shower to Shower, a powder brand the company soldoff in 2012, caused their ovarian cancer or mesothelioma.Many of the ovarian cancer lawsuits have blamed the disease on perineal use of J&Jcosmetic talcs — a claim supported by some studies showing an association between suchuse and increased cancer risk. The most recent cases have alleged that J&J's talc productscontained asbestos, long a known carcinogen.Jury awards woman $70M in lawsuit alleging talcum powder ovarian cancer linkIn an investigation published Dec. 14, Reuters revealed that J&J knew for decades that smallamounts of asbestos had occasionally been found in its raw talc and in Baby Powder andShower to Shower, based on test results from the early 1970s to the early2000s — information it did not disclose to regulators or the public.J&J challenged the ﬁndings of the Reuters report, describing them as inaccurate andmisleading.Krystal Kim, a 53-year-old African-American, was one of 22 plaintiffs whose case in St. Louisresulted in a jury verdict last summer of $4.69 billion against J&J. Kim said Baby Powder andShower to Shower were household staples among her family and friends when she wasgrowing up in New Jersey. Kim played baseball as a teenager, she said, and her mother toldher to apply Baby Powder to avoid being "the stinky girl.""Every time I took a shower, I put Baby Powder on," recalled Kim, whose ovarian cancer, ﬁrstdiagnosed in 2014, is now in remission. "I put it on my panties, on my clothes, everywhere."J&J is appealing the St. Louis verdict. The company did not respond to requests for aninterview with Chief Executive Oﬃcer Alex Gorsky or any other executive to discuss thecompany's marketing of cosmetic powders.In an emailed response to questions from Reuters, J&J said its Baby Powder is safe andasbestos-free. It noted that the company's marketing over the years has been directed atmany demographics and groups, and that "we're proud pioneers of the practice ofmulticultural marketing." It also pointed out that some Baby Powder ads have featured thecornstarch version of Baby Powder, the safety of which isn't questioned.Reports by Bloomberg News, the New York Times and the Post and Courier of Charleston,South Carolina, have cited some internal J&J documents revealing the company's focus onAfrican-American and overweight women at certain times. But the full timeline and scale ofthe marketing efforts, particularly those aimed at teenage girls, in minority communities andthrough organizations such as Weight Watchers, are reported here for the ﬁrst time.

Since healthprofessionals had already recommended against using talc on infants, a 1986 internal reportwarned, a "last straw" safety concern could lead consumers to abandon the productaltogether.  
As early as 1992, the company keyed in on the sales potential with minority women. A J&Jmemo that year mentions "high usage" rates for Baby Powder of 52 percent among African-Americans and 37.6 percent among Hispanic customers – and notes that women of bothethnicities use the product more than the general population.The memo suggests investigating "ethnic (African American/Hispanic) opportunities to growthe franchise," while referring to "negative publicity from the health community on talc,"including "inhalation, dust, negative doctor endorsement, cancer linkage." Portions of thatmemo were cited in reports from Bloomberg and the New York Times.By 2006, the company was recognizing that "consumers do not see a need for powder,"according to a sales presentation that year. Baby Powder shipments had been "stagnating"in recent years, the presentation said, and it was essential to "ﬁnd a new business model"that "strategically and eﬃciently targets high propensity consumers."Baby powder jury awards woman record-setting $110.5M US in cancer lawsuitThose groups, according to the presentation: African-Americans, nearly 60 percent of whomused Baby Powder by this time, compared to about 30 percent for the overall population;overweight people; and ﬁtness-conscious people looking to lose weight.It was also in 2006 that the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), an arm ofthe World Health Organization, classiﬁed perineal use of talc as "possibly carcinogenic,"saying available research provided "limited evidence" it caused cancer in humans.

In another 2010 email, she said the DJs will be the BabyPowder "brand ambassadors," charged with "communicating our message, encouraginglisteners to call in to talk about how they use Baby Powder and driving to retail whereappropriate."All the radio promotions would be "based on the weather," she wrote. "If it's hot and humid,we'll run that week. If it's rainy or colder, we won't."DeStasio, who now works as a promotions and marketing manager at Bristol-Myers SquibbCo, did not respond to requests for comment.J&J's spending on Baby Powder promotions – coupons, discounts, and samples – came toabout $1.2 million in 2008 and again in 2010, almost half of it directed at overweight andminority women. By 2011, the company cut back its promotional spending to $752,000,mostly aimed at the general consumer market.In 2013, a jury found J&J negligent in the ﬁrst case ever to claim that regular use of BabyPowder for feminine hygiene caused ovarian cancer. The jury didn't award monetarydamages, but the verdict spawned a cascade of similar lawsuits.Of the eight ovarian cancer cases that have gone to trial so far, four have resulted in verdictsfor plaintiffs and one for the company. Three other verdicts against J&J were overturned onappeal.In 12 trials of cases claiming that asbestos in talc caused plaintiffs' mesothelioma, J&J wascleared of liability in ﬁve, and plaintiffs won three, resulting in a total of $172 million indamages. Four others resulted in hung juries and mistrials.Talcum powder could pose danger to lungs and ovaries, Health Canada warnsJ&J is appealing all the verdicts against it.Meanwhile, J&J has pulled back from marketing speciﬁcally to minority and overweightwomen. A 2015 presentation makes no mention of minorities, suggesting the brand "targetadults, with a focus on men."Plaintiffs' lawyers and other advocates have become more vocal in criticizing the targetedmarketing campaigns. In its most recent newsletter, the National Council of Negro Women, awomen's leadership group with about 30,000 members, drew attention to the issue with anessay penned by civil-rights lawyer Ben Crump, who is representing some Baby Powderplaintiffs.In an interview, Janice Mathis, the council's executive director, said: "Lots of products targetAfrican-Americans. That's marketing 101: Go where our customers are. What has medisturbed about this is that you didn't give any caveat to the customers, once you knewthere was a possibility there was some danger."POPULAR NOW IN NEWS
