Abstract
This paper examines the use of chemical or electrocoagulation treatment process followed by ion-exchange process of the textile dye efﬂuent.
The dye efﬂuent was treated using polymeric coagulant (cationic dye-ﬁxing agent) or electrocoagulation (iron and aluminum electrode) processunder various conditions such as various current densities and effect of pH. Efﬁciencies of COD reduction, colour removal and power consumptionwere studied for each process. The chemical or electrochemical treatment are indented primarily to remove colour and COD of wastewater whileion exchange is used to further improve the removal efﬁciency of the colour, COD, Fe concentration, conductivity, alkalinity and total dissolvedsolids (TDS). From the results chemical coagulation, maximum COD reduction of about 81.3% was obtained at 300 mg/l of coagulant whereas inelectrocoagulation process, maximum COD removal of about 92.31% (0.25 A/dm
2) was achieved with energy consumption of about 19.29 kWh/kg
of COD and 80% (1 A/dm2) COD removal was obtained with energy consumption of about 130.095 kWh/kg of COD at iron and aluminum
electrodes, respectively. All the experimental results, throughout the present study, have indicated that chemical or electrocoagulation treatm ent
followed by ion-exchange methods were very effective and were capable of elevating quality of the treated wastewater efﬂuent to the reuse standardof the textile industry.Crown Copyright © 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V . All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
Many techniques have been used for treatment of waste
wastewater, such as adsorption, biological treatment, oxidation,coagulation and/or ﬂocculation, of such coagulation is one ofthe most commonly used techniques. Inorganic coagulants suchas lime and salts of iron, magnesium and aluminum have beenused over many years, but with changes in dyes and with thedye consents proposed by water authorities, these no longergiven completely satisfactory treatment [1]. Not all dyes are
effectively removed by inorganic coagulants; thus alum is unsat-isfactory for the removal of soluble dyes such as reactive anddirect dyes [2]. Organic polymers have therefore been devel-
oped for colour removal treatment and, in general, they offer thesame advantages with the production of less sludge and signif-icantly improved colour removal [1]. For the removal of colour

option exists for many soluble dyes [3]. Traditional methods
for dealing with textile wastewater consist of various combina-tions of biological, physical and chemical treatment methods [4].
Common biological treatment processes are often ineffective inremoving dyes, which are highly structured polymers with lowbiodegradability [5]. Various physical–chemical techniques are
also available for the treatment of aqueous streams to elimi-nate dyes; chemical coagulation followed by sedimentation [6]
and adsorption are the widely used ones [7], but other advanced
techniques are often applied, e.g. UV [8,9] , ozonation [10], ultra-
sonic decomposition, or combined oxidation processes [11–13] .
Electrocoagulation is a process consisting of creating metallichydroxide ﬂocs within the wastewater by electrodissolution ofsoluble anodes, usually made of iron or aluminum. This methodhas been practiced for most of the 20th century with limited suc-cess. Recently, however, there has been renewed interest in theuse of electrocoagulation owing to the increase in environmen-tal restrictions on efﬂuent wastewater. In the past decade, thistechnology has been increasingly used in developed countriesfor the treatment of industrial wastewaters [14–16] . Electro-

coagulation has been proposed for the treatment of various
efﬂuents such as wastewater containing food and protein wastes[17], textile wastewater [18], aqueous suspensions containing
kaolinite, bentonite, and ultra ﬁne particles [19,20] , ﬂuoride-
containing water [21], restaurant wastewater [22,23] , textile
dye solution [24–25] and smelter wastewater containing has
full arsenic [26]. Several researchers have studied the feasibil-
ity of electrochemical degradation of textile dyes using variouselectrode materials for wastewater treatment. Electrochemicaldegradation of different dye compounds was studied using tita-nium based DSA electrodes [27,28] , platinum electrode [29],
diamond and metal alloy electrodes [30] and boron doped dia-
mond electrodes [31,32] . One available treatment technology
widely used in recent years is Fenton oxidation. This advancedchemical oxidation technology is based on the production ofhydroxyl radicals,
•OH, which have an extremely high oxi-
dation potential (•OH/H 2O = +2.73 V). The Fenton oxidation
process has been employed successfully to treat different indus-trial wastewaters [33–38] . These methods are indented to treat
the textile wastewater to a level that meets the discharge stan-dards required by the government. However, due to dwindlingsupply and increasing demand of water in the textile indus-tries, a better alternative is to attempt to further improve thewater quality of treated wastewater for reuse standard. Mean-while, high treatment costs of these methods have stimulated, inrecent years, the search for more cost effective treatment meth-ods and reuse standards. In the present work, an attempt hasbeen made to study the treatment efﬁciency of chemical (poly-meric chemical coagulation) or electrocoagulation process forthe removal of colour and COD of the efﬂuent, followed byion-exchange process for further lowering the colour, COD, Feconcentration, conductivity, alkalinity and total dissolved solids(TDS).
2. Mechanism of polymeric coagulant
Textile dye-ﬁxing agents are used as a polymeric coagulant.
Direct and reactive dyes contain RSO
3−group and dye-ﬁxing
agent are RN+Cl−. When these two solutions are dissolved
in water, they ionize in to long cations and small anions. Onthe other hand, when a dye is dissolved in water, it ionizesinto long coloured anions and small sodium ions. When the-ses two solutions are mixed the long ions of opposite ioniccharge combine with one another to form an insoluble complex[39].

2.1. Mechanism of electrocoagulation
Four main mechanisms have been suggested to describe the
process by which contaminants are removed from wastewa-ter using this system. These consist of surface complexation,
electrostatic attraction, chemical modiﬁcation, and precipita-tion.
The chemistry of surface complexation is not well understood
and is speciﬁc to each efﬂuent, but is thought to occur in thefollowing manner [40]:
Dye–H +(HO)OFe →Dye–OFe +H
2O (4)
Dye–H +(HO)OAl →Dye–OAl +H2O (5)
In addition, for forming all possible surface complexes, it may
be possible to remove remaining dyestuff by simple electrostaticattraction, hydrous iron oxide. In combination with the varioussurface complexes, contains areas of apparent positive and neg-ative charge. The attraction of opposite charges is sufﬁcient toremove some dissolved species from the efﬂuent stream. Chem-ical modiﬁcation may occur on passage of efﬂuent through theelectrochemical cell as well as during subsequent degassing. Thechemistry C
C and N N (common in dyes) allows “catalytic
hydrogenation” or reduction to occur in the presence of hydro-gen gas and a catalyst. The presence of metal ions and hydrogengas in this reaction suggests that the above could occur, but fur-ther research is required to conﬁrm the extent of this mechanismand the conditions, which favor it. Precipitation is a mechanismby which soluble species with opposite charges react with oneanother to form insoluble solids. This reaction often determinesthe success of heavy metal removal from contaminated water.In the case of dyestuffs, however, it is believed to have limitedapplicability [40].
3. Material and methods
All the reagents used were of Analytical Reagent grade.
Polymeric coagulant (dye-ﬁxing agent- Sandoﬁx-WRN) anddye efﬂuent (Procion Black 5B-Reactive dye) were collectedfrom Textile industry. The cross-linked polystyrene bead resins,which are commercially known as Amberlite IR 120 and Amber-lite IRA 400, were used.
3.1. Analytical measurements
The analytical methods of the COD of all samples were deter-
mined by the dichromate reﬂux method [41]. In electrochemical
process the chloride ions cause interference, because they canbe oxidized to Cl
2by dichromate under the analysis conditions,
the samples were treated with Ag 2SO4to form a precipitate of
AgCl that was separated by centrifugation. The oxidized prod-ucts and the reduction in dye concentration were measured byusing a UV–Visible Spectrophotometer (Systronics 118), thecolour removal was calculated by following formulae:

3.2. Electrochemical cell
The electrolysis cell ( Fig. 1 ) used in the present study consists
of a glass beaker of 500 ml capacity closed with a PVC lid havingprovision to ﬁt a cathode and an anode. Commercially availablemild steel and aluminum were used as anodes while stainlesssteel was used as cathode. It is connected to 2 A and 15 V dcregulated power supply.
3.2.1. Ion-exchange experimental set up
The ion-exchange column consisted of glass column of length
60 cm and diameter 2.5 cm. It was plugged with cotton at thebottom for free ﬂow of the treated wastewater and to hold theresin intact. The columns consisted 20 ml of cation-exchangeresin (Amberlite IR 120) and other one consisted of 40 ml ofanion-exchange resin (Amberlite IRA 400). The constant ﬂowrate (5 ml/min) through the column was maintained with the helpof a peristaltic pump. The ﬂow cell is shown in Fig. 2 .
3.3. Experimental procedure
The present experimental study involved two major processes
such as chemical treatment or electrocoagulation (iron and alu-minum electrode) process followed by ion-exchange process.These two treatments can be operated independently in batch-wise processes. Two hundred millilitres of industrial efﬂuents(Procion Black 5B-Reactive dye) of known concentration weretaken for each experiment. In this ﬁrst process the efﬂuent was

chemically treated using appropriate amounts of Sandoﬁx-WRN
(cationic dye-ﬁxing agent) under various conditions whereas inthe second process, electrocoagulation was carried out under gal-vanostatic condition. Samples were collected at regular intervalsof time for estimation of COD, colour, and power consumption.After completion of chemical treatment or electrocoagulation,the wastewater was then subjected to ion-exchange process. Theion-exchange experiments were conducted in a ﬂow cell process.
3.3.1. Chemical treatment
In chemical treatment, textile dye-ﬁxing agent was used as
a polymeric coagulant. Four hundred millilitres of wastewatersample was taken and coagulated using Sandoﬁx-WRN (cationicdye-ﬁxing agent) under various pH ranges from 2 to 12 andamount of coagulant required was optimized.
3.3.2. Electrocoagulation
Electrocoagulation is the modiﬁcation of electroﬂoatation
where the coagulation agent is produced in situ at the respectiveelectrodes (The most commonly used electrodes are iron andaluminum.). In this method, the pollutant is transformed intoamorphous precipitates or adsorbed on hydroxides formed at theanodes. This method is also called as electroﬂocculation. Fourhundred millilitres of wastewater sample was taken and coagu-lated. In this process, mild steel/aluminum were used as anodeand stainless steel was used as cathode under various currentdensities (0.25–1 A/dm
2).
3.3.3. Ion-exchange process
After the chemical or electrocoagulation treatment, 1000 ml
of treated wastewater subjected to ion-exchange columns underconstant ﬂow rate (5 ml/min). Before the ion-exchange process,the pH was adjusted to about 7 and the wastewater was ﬁlteredusing glass wool to remove the suspended solids. The ﬁltra-tion signiﬁcantly helped to avoid fouling of ion-exchange resins.The samples were taken periodically for measurements of COD,S. Raghu, C.

ion concentrations.
4. Result and discussion
4.1. Polymeric coagulants
The effect of coagulant dosage on the percentage of COD
reduction and colour removal for dye efﬂuent are presented inFig. 3 . These results indicate that a signiﬁcant amount of dye
can be removed. It was also observed that removal efﬁcienciesof both COD and colour increases with increase of coagulantdosage. The maximum COD reductions of 81.3% and colourremoval of about 98.2% were obtained at 300 mg/l of coagulant.It is evident from the results that minimum dosage amount ofcoagulant (300 mg/l) is required to treat the above dye wastew-ater. It is also observed that the COD began to appear in theelectrolyte when dosage amount exceeds the optimum level.This could be due to the presence of the residual coagulantremains in the treated water. Also the pH of the electrolyte solu-tion has been varied in order to check its inﬂuence on colourremoval and COD reduction. Experiments were conducted underacid, alkaline and neutral conditions and the observed results aregiven in Fig. 4 . It can be ascertained from Fig. 4 that the percent-
age of COD reduction has increased from 56% (pH 7) to 81.3%(pH 10) when the electrolyte pH increased to alkaline conditionfrom neutral. On contrary, in acidic condition precipitation wasnot seen. Increase in the pH of electrolyte favors the precipitationreaction. Consequently precipitation of dye has been increased.The reaction was favorable at neutral (pH 7) and more acute inalkaline conditions particularly at pH 10.

4.2. Electrocoagulation
The electrocoagulation has been carried out for two different
anodes, namely iron and aluminum. The optimum conditionsfor effective removal of COD, colour and minimum energy con-sumption have been studied at different current densities in batchreactor. The supply of current to the electrocoagulation systemdetermines the amount of Al
3+or Fe2+ions released from the
respective electrodes. For aluminum, the electrochemical equiv-alent mass is 335.6 mg/Ah. For iron, the value is 1041 mg/Ah.Experiments were conducted at four current densities keepingother parameters constant. The COD reduction increased withcurrent density ( Figs. 5 and 6 ). This may be explained that the
release of ions, i.e. the release of metal ions increased with cur-rent density, which eventually increases the reduction of COD.The efﬁciencies of COD removal at different reaction times invarious conditions are shown in Figs. 5 and 6 . These results show
that 100% COD reduction was achieved while iron electrode wasused. On the other hand, it was 80% with aluminum electrode.Figs. 7 and 8 show colour removal efﬁciencies at different reac-
tion time under various current densities. The maximum colourremoval efﬁciencies were in the order of 97.06 and 94.27% for

iron and aluminum electrodes. Though the COD removal was
100% while using mild steel electrode, the residual colour indi-cated incomplete removal of soluble iron. But COD reductionwas more than that of aluminum electrode due to more solublein iron electrode during the electrolysis. The power consump-tion of the both electrodes was shown in Figs. 9 and 10 .O nt h e

applied current density. The 100% COD removal was achieved
within 6 h with a maximum energy consumption of 78.5 kWh/kgof COD at 1 A/dm
2. However, at 0.25 A/dm2, the maximum
COD removal of t92.31% was achieved with lower energy con-
sumption of about 19.29 kWh/kg of COD in iron electrode and130.095 kWh/kg of COD at 1 A/dm
2with 80% of COD removal
in the aluminum electrode for maximum current density. There-fore, an optimum point must be carefully determined giving afaster removal rate and energy consumption quite low. Hence,the optimal current densities of 0.25 and 1 A/dm
2were chosen
for iron and aluminum electrodes, respectively. From the results,it is understood that, the process involving iron electrode, com-pletely removes the dye with low electrical consumption in ashort time.
4.3. Ion-exchange process
In the present study, chemically/electrochemically treated
wastewater was subjected to ion-exchange process. The con-ductivity of the wastewater after chemical treatment andelectrocoagulation treatment was observed as 4910 and5200/H9262mho/cm, respectively, against the reuse standard of
100/H9262mho/cm. Such a high conductivity of wastewater indicates
that it still contains a signiﬁcant amount of inorganic salts andother ions. To remove these ions and other impurities, both cross-linked divinylbenzene-polystyrene based cationic (AmberliteIR 120) and anionic (Amberlite IRA 400) ion-exchange resinswere used in the ﬂow cell experiment. A cation-exchange resincaptures positively charged ions and an anion-exchange resinnegatively charged ions. In fresh resin, the cations attached tothe cationic resin are H
+, those attached to the anionic resin
OH−. Treated wastewater, which was passed through the cation-
exchange resin resulted in exchange of the cations (displacing ofH
+) and subsequently passed through the anion-exchange resin
absorbed anions, displacing the OH−ions, As a result, ﬁnally
ion free water was obtained. The optimum ratio of resins werestudied at room temperature using 100 ml of treated wastewater(5200/H9262mho/cm) and amount of resin (Amberlite IR 120 (H

500 ml beaker. The solution was stirred using a magnetic stirrer
for 10 min. Samples were collected every minute for measure-ments of conductivity. An optimal ratio of 1:2 the cationic andanionic resin was observed and is shown in Fig. 11 . At the other
ratios, the treated wastewater has a rather high conductivity andalso has a low or high pH. It is of interest to note that the opti-mal ratio 1:2 of cationic to anionic exchange resins is much inline with that was recommended by Jiang [42]. An experimen-
tal study was carried out to determine the break-even point ofion-exchange resin columns. It is very much important to studythe operational capacity of the resin and the process. Fig. 12
demonstrates the break-even point of ion-exchange resins. Theexperimental data indicate that 20 ml of cation-exchange resinand 40 ml of anion-exchange resins are needed to treat 400 ml

steps were presented in Table 1 . Also ion exchange treated
wastewater was compared with deionized water quality. Inor-ganic in the treated wastewater before and after ion exchangewere measured by spectrophotometer, NOV A 60 and are listedinTable 2 . Three major inorganic ions such as Cl
−,N O 3−and
SO42−were measured in the wastewater before and after ion-
exchange process. The inorganic ion concentrations measuredin the treated wastewater after ion exchanges are nearly equal tothose in the deionized water.
5. Conclusion
The treatment systems consisted of the chemical or elec-
trocoagulation followed by ion-exchange process. Polymericchemical coagulant (Sandoﬁx-WRN) and electrochemical treat-ment methods were employed in the present study to investigatethe effectiveness of treatment of industrial dye efﬂuents (ProcionBlack 5B-Reactive dye). In the case of chemical coagulation,maximum COD reduction of about 81.3% was obtained at300 mg/l of coagulant whereas in electrocoagulation process,maximum COD removal of about 92.31% (0.25 A/dm

imum energy consumption (19.29 kWh/kg of COD) could beachieved at electrocoagulation using iron electrode. To furtherelevate the water quality to the reuse standard, an ion exchange330 S. Raghu, C. Ahmed Basha / Journal of Hazardous Materials 149 (2007) 324–330
using cationic and anionic exchange resin was found necessary.
Experimental results indicated that 20 ml of cation-exchangeresin and 40 ml of anion-exchange resins were needed to treat400 ml of treated wastewater containing 5200 /H9262mho/cm effec-
tively. The water quality of treated wastewater was observed tobe consistently excellent, comparable to that of deionized water.
