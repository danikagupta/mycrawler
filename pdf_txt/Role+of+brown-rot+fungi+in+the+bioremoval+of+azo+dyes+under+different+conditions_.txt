ABSTRACT 
 
The present study is vital to the understanding of bioremediation of structurally different azo dyes by some 
unusual Brown-rot fungi. Bioremoval of each dye (20 mg l-1) was tested in two different culture media 
under static and shaking conditions by taking inocula from different fungi. Fungal strains showed varying 
dyes removal abilities, though considerable high in case of Acid Red (AR) 151(di-azo) as compared to 
Orange (Or) II (mono-azo). With an exception of Aspergillus tereus SA3, all the fungal isolates showed 
higher removal of dyes in SDB. Under static condition, the maximum decolorizing fungal strains were; 
Aspergillus flavus SA2 (67%) and Alternaria spp. SA4 (57%) in AR 151, while Penicillium spp. (34 and 
33 %) in Orange II, in SDB and STE, respectively. Bioremoval of dyes was considerably increased when 
experiments were shifted from static to shaking mode. It was specifically increased (%) in; AR 151 (255) 
with Penicillium spp., Or II with A. flavus SA2 (112) and Alternaria spp. (111). The primary mechanism of 
dyes removal proved to be fungal biosorption. However, reduction of dyes (onto fungal) with formation of 
their products (. naphthol, sulphalinic acid and aniline) furthermore revealed that dyes (specifically azo) 
were actually biodegraded.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Among different industrial sectors, Textiles is one of the 
largest and growing throughout the world. Textile industries 
consume an extensive and diverse array of chemicals in the 
form of dyes, dispersants, levelling agents, acids, alkalis, salts 
and sometimes heavy metals (7, 12). A huge amount of water 
i.e., 95 to 400 l kg-1 fabric (approximately), depending on the 
ongoing process, is used and most of it latterly discharged as 
waste from the textile industry. Textile wastewater accounts for 
about 22% of the total volume generated from all different 
types of industries. Generally, wastewater from textile industries has been characterized as; extremely colored and 
alkaline with high load of Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), 
Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), dissolved and suspended 
solids (21, 34).  
Textile dyes are of various types depending upon their; 
structures and mode of application (30). They have been 
continuously exhausted (5-50%) in the water bodies because of 
their poor adsorbability to the fibers (29, 53). Mostly, dyes are 
noticeable in water at concentrations, as low as 1 mgl−1. 
Therefore, wastewaters, typically with dyes contents in the 
range of 10–200 mg l−1 are extremely colored (54). Presences 
of dyes raise dissolve solids (13, 51), cause rapid diminution of

oxygen level in the water bodies (1). Artificial dyes and 
pigments are made colorfast and stable by using certain 
additives like; ammonia, chloride, nitrate, phosphate, sulfate, 
and heavy metals. The recalcitrant nature of dyes in water 
bodies not only stops biological recycling of nutrients but also 
reduce the biotic productivity of aquatic ecosystems.  In 
addition, certain dyes and their degradation products have been 
reported to have toxic to mutagenic affects in almost all forms 
of life including humans (6, 11, 18, 47). 
Dyes, because of their diverse and stable chemical nature, 
are difficult to remove in wastewater by conventional 
treatments (31). In this perspective, numerous physical, 
chemical and biological techniques have been researched in the 
last few decades. Relatively, biological treatments have been 
gaining much attention in terms of their low cost and eco-
friendly nature. Amongst different bioremediation agents, the 
roles of bacteria and fungi have always been considered vital 
for chemical like dyes. Still, the detail metabolic demands of 
different microbes are complex, impeding their utilization for 
the remediation of huge amount of colored wastewater. The 
preliminary biodegradation of dyes (azo) has mostly been 
supported under anaerobic condition specifically by bacteria; 
however, further mineralization of dyes’ products required 
aerobic condition. Therefore, sequential anaerobic verses 
aerobic treatments are convincingly devised for the complete 
mineralized of dyes at pilot scale. Alternatively, fungal 
biosorption/bioadsorption (3, 4, 52) and biodegradation of dyes 
has always proved efficient under aerobic condition. Among 
different fungi, White-rot has only been the most researched 
and an effective tool in the removal of dyes. Enzymes like 
Lignin peroxidase (LiP), Manganese peroxidase (MnP), 
Laccase (Lac) of these fungi are meant for the 
transformation/degradation of lignin present in dead biomass of 
plants. However, similar enzymes due to their low substrate 
(lignin) specificities have also been employed quite 
successfully in the degradation of aromatics like dyes (14, 27, 
35, 38, 40, 45, 56).  
Only a few studies have reported the bioremoval potentials 
of Brown-rot fungi for different dyes (5, 16, 48, 57). Further research work on such fungal strains is much needed in 
bioremediation perspective. The present research work 
addresses the bioremoval potentials of certain Brown-rot fungi 
for different dyes in batch scale static/shaking conditions. 
Fungal strains were seeded as inocula in the synthetic colored 
wastewater in order to check their abilities to grow and utilize 
different dyes. 
 
MATERIAL AND METHODS 
 
Chemicals 
All chemical compounds were purchased from Sigma 
chemicals Co., (St. Louis) and E. Merck (Darmstadt, 
Germany). They were of the highest purity commercially 
available and not purified further. The structure of dyes [Acid 
red (AR) 151 (Di-azo) and Orange (Or) II (Mono-azo)] used in 
study is showed in Figure 1 (4).

Composition of Saboraud dextrose broth (SDB) 
Saboraud dextrose broth (SDB) was made by adding per 
liter of distilled water; peptone 10.0 g and dextrose 40.0 g. pH 
of the medium was adjusted to 5.6 using 0.1M HCl and NaOH.  909Ali, N. et al.                Brown-rot fungi in the bioremoval of azo dyes 
 
 
Composition of simulated textile effluent (STE) 
Simulated effluent was made by adding per liter of water 
(distilled); CH3COOH (99.9%) 0.150 ml, (NH2)2CO 100.0 mg, 
KH2PO4 67.0 mg, NaHCO3 840.0 mg, MgSO4.7H2O 38.0 mg, 
CaCl2 21.0 mg, FeCl3.6H2O 7.0 mg and C6H12O6 6 gm. pH of 
the effluent was adjusted to 8 using 0.1M HCl and NaOH.  
 
Isolation and identification of fungi  
Fungal strains were isolated from sludge samples collected 
from storage pond of textile effluent. These fungi were 
identified according to Ali et al. (4). 
 
Preparation of fungal inocula 
As describe by Ali et al. (4). 
 
Dyes removal assays  
Removal of each dye (20 mg l-1) was carried out by taking 
100 ml of liquid medium (SDB/STE) in 250 ml cotton plugged 
Erlenmeyer flask. Each dye containing solution was treated 
with 0.001% (w/v) fresh inocula of a specific fungus for 8 days 
at 30°C under static or shaking (100 rotations per minute) 
conditions. All the experiments were conducted in triplicate to 
avoid error.  
 
Analytical 
Dyes concentrations: Samples of treated dye containing 
solutions were drawn at regular intervals (24 hrs) into plastic 
vials (size 2.5 ml) for a period of 8 days. Each sample was 
initially filtered through Whattman filter paper No 1. Filtrate 
collected in each sample was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 
minutes, the supernatant filtered through a 0.2 µm syringe filter 
in order to remove residual particulate material.  The residual 
amount of dye in each sample was monitored by taking its 
absorbance value at max (AR 151= 512, 225, Or II= 480) 
using a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV/VIS). Absorbance 
values were converted to concentrations by using standard 
curves (4). Initial and final samples from the experiments with 
AR 151, Or II and Db K2RL were also analyzed through High 
Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) [Agilent 1100 
ChemStation, equipped with a diode array detector and 
LiChrospher 100 RP-18 column (4mm i.d. x 250mm length) containing 5 µm packed particles (Merck KgaA, Darmstadt, 
Germany)]. The solvent system (mobile phase) used for eluting 
Or II was acetonitrile and 0.03 M ammonium carbonate buffer 
(30:70 %) and for AR 151; it was acetonitrile and H2O (30: 
70). The flow rate was kept 1.5 ml min-1 during the analysis. 
Percentage of dye removal in each experiment was calculated 
by using the formula; 
 
Dye removal (%) = Initial conc. – final conc. / initial conc. (100) 
 
Statistical  
The crude data obtained in different experiments was 
statistically analyzed using ANOVA (2 way without 
replication) and Least significant difference (LSD) tests. Data 
were expressed as Mean (ave.)±Standard error of means (S.E). 
Results with significant differences (p = <0.05) were 
alphabetically ranked.  
 
Precaution 
Standard sterilization procedures were followed during 
experiments. 
 
RESULT 
 
Fungal strains isolated from textile wastewater pond 
showed a great deal of variation in the decolorization of azo 
dyes in two different culture media under static condition 
(30°C for 8 days) (Table 1). Dyes removal (decolorization) 
appeared to be due to both fungal biosorption and 
biodegradation. With an exception of A. tereus SA3, all the 
fungal isolates showed greater removal of dyes in SDB. 
However, there was observed a no significant difference in 
results in both the media in case of Or II. Comparatively, A. 
tereus SA3 proved to be least decolorizing in both dyes. 
Overall, the average removal of AR 151 was significantly 
higher (18-67 %) than Or II (22-34%) by the fungal isolates. It 
(ave.) (%) was 54 and 42 in AR 151, 28 and 27 in Or II, in 
SDB and STE, respectively. Fungal strains which showed 
better removal (%) of dyes were including; A. flavus SA2 (67 
and 51) and Alternaria spp. SA4 (65 and 57) in AR 151, while 
Penicillium spp. SA5 in Or II in SDB and STE respectively.     910Ali, N. et al.                Brown-rot fungi in the bioremoval of azo dyes

Results of dyes removal (decolorization) by different fungi 
in shaking cultures are shown in Table 2 and 3. Comparing two 
dyes, decolorization of AR 151 was maximum (ave. = 76.79%) 
by the entire fungal group. Alternaria spp. SA4 established as 
the highest decolorizing fungal isolate for both dyes (ave. = 
78%). Contrarily, A. tereus SA3 not only showed least 
decolorizing ability but it also exhibited less tendency towards 
degradation of dyes’ products. Primarily, the fungal biomasses (pellets) appeared to be responsible in the removal of dye 
through biosorption/bioadsorption. This observation was later 
on confirmed through detailed microscopic examination of 
fungal hypha. Nevertheless, degradation of dyes was positively 
evident from the production of their products. Dyes that were 
adsorbed onto fungal biomass turned colorless but this process 
appeared to be quite slow and it was specifically notice under 
static condition.

Decolorization of AR 151 (20 mg l-1) (Table 2) was 
particularly higher with A. flavus SA2 (97.70%) and Alternaria 
spp. SA4 (98.47%). However, A. tereus SA3 (55%) and 
Penicillium spp. SA5 (65), also showed a considerable removal 
of AR 151 (Table 2). The three main products analyzed in the 
decolorization of AR 151 included; alpha (.) naphthol, 
sulfanilic (S) acid and aniline. The decreasing trend in total 
products formation with different fungi on 8th day was as 
follows; SA3>SA2>SA5>SA4. Generally, sulfanilic acid was 
the most yielded product with all the fungal isolates though its 
concentrations (mg l-1) were particularly higher with A. flavus 
SA2 (20.52) and A. tereus SA3 (19).  The second most 
abundant product analyzed was . naphthol, and its 
concentration remained  5 mg l-1 in all cases, while aniline 
was only quantified (2.84) in case of A. tereus SA3. Generally, 
the rate of decolorization decreased with time and the high time 
of decolorization was critically noted in the initial 96 hrs.  
Decolorizations  of Or II (20 mg l-1) (Table 3) were; 48, 
44.67, 58.66 and 55.68 (%), with 22, 10.5, 5, 3.2 (mg l-1) of 
total residual products in case of A. flavus SA2, A. tereus SA3, 
Alternaria spp. SA4 and Penicillium spp. SA5, respectively. The only major product quantified was . naphthol and its 
concentration (16 mg l-1) was maximum in case of A. flavus 
SA2. The concentrations of the remaining two products kept  
to 3.5 mg l-1 for all the samples analyzed. Decolorization rate 
of Or II was specifically high in the initial 24 hrs with 
Alternaria spp. SA4, It remained high during (hrs); 0-72 in A.

DISCUSSION 
 
Studies on Brown-rot fungi involved in the biodegradation 
of dyes are few (4, 5, 22, 57), nevertheless, the current study 
has substantially vitalized the role of such fungal isolates. All 
the five fungal isolates showed removal of both azo dyes, 
however, it was varying in different culture media and under 
static/shaking condition (Table 1, 3). Similar dyes removal 
abilities have mostly been reported in different WRF (26, 28). 
In this context, small structural differences related to the 
position and nature of substituents on the aromatic rings of 
dyes proved to be markedly influencing their biodegradation by  912Ali, N. et al.                Brown-rot fungi in the bioremoval of azo dyes 
 
 
certain enzymes (4, 14, 37, 43, 54). Among dyes, azo are 
specifically known to be color fast and structurally stable in 
oxygenic condition (55), due to which they are hard to remove 
by conventional treatments. This observation is surely justified 
in case of Or II (mono azo), which proved to be least degraded 
compared to AR 151 (Di azo) (Table 1). Presence of two azo 
groups between benzene rings in AR 151 (Figure 1) might have 
supported in its efficient removal.  
Biosorption is reported to be the primary dye removal 
process in wood rotting basidiomycetes (7, 19, 26). Similar, 
mechanism was evident in the present study; however, fungal 
biomass gradually turned colorless after dyes bioadsorption. 
Furthermore, analysis of dyes’ product (AR 151 and Or II) 
after 8 days suggested that the dyes were in fact biodegraded. 
These observations are in line with the findings of Balan and 
Monterio (7), where they reported the removal of Indigo dye 
by fungal adsorption and extracellular degradation. Bio-
adsorption, in particular, has been linked to electrostatic pull; 
between the negatively charged dyes and the positively charged 
cell wall components (2, 3). The bioremoval abilities for 
different dyes have been separately related to biosorption and 
biodegradation in case of P. chrysosporium. Fungal biomass 
showing biosorption of a specific dye remained extremely 
colored; otherwise, it kept colorless (43). Moreover, 
biodegradation of metal complex dyes (Grey lanaset G.) 
revealed dyes degradation in three successive stages. Primary 
dye adsorption (1st) to the fungus lead to the splitting of metal 
complex bond from it (2nd). Finally, the degradation of dyes 
took place (3nd) with the release of products into the culture 
medium (10). 
Dyes degradation properties of the fungi have been 
reported to change with varying nutrients in different culture 
media (15, 16, 42). Therefore, optimization of culture 
conditions should always be considered as a prerequisite in 
bioremediation studies. With the exception of A. tereus SA3, 
all other fungal isolates showed better removal of dyes in SDB 
than in STE (Table 1). Greater removal of dyes in SDB might 
be associated with the low pH and availability of higher 
glucose (as C source) levels. Glucose not only acts as a reducing agent for dyes (8) but also promotes fungal growth 
and metabolism (8, 9, 41). Higher glucose levels also create 
acidic condition in the culture medium, which thereby supports 
better removal of dyes (41). Nevertheless, higher levels of 
glucose can also have a limiting effect on fungal dyes removal 
abilities (24) as observed in the case of A. tereus SA3. 
Cultural stability proved to have an important role in 
fungal growth and associated dyes’ removal and it is noticeable 
in present study. Decolorization of dyes by the fungal strains 
was significantly increased when shifted from static to shaking 
treatment (Table 1, 3). Specifically, maximum increase in 
decolorization (%) was observed in; AR 151 (255%) with 
Penicillium spp., Or II with A. flavus SA2 (112%) and 
Alternaria spp. (111%). Least improvement in decolorization 
was noticed in case of; AR 151 (39%) with A. tereus SA3, Or 
II (70%) with Penicillium spp. SA5. Previously, similar results 
were observe for A. niger SA1 for dyes like Or II, Sb and Db 
K2RL. However, no significant change in decolorization was 
noticed in AR 151 when experiments were shifted from static 
to shaking condition (4). Likewise, Husseiny (22) also reported 
the efficient removal of reactive dyes in static culture 
condition.  
Fungi being aerobic organisms normally show better dyes 
degradation activities under facilitated agitated condition (17, 
20, 23, 28, 50, 56). Shaking increases; the mass (substrate) and 
oxygen transfer from the culture medium to the cells, thereby, 
it facilitates optimum fungal growth and enzyme (oxidase) 
production (50). Nevertheless, no significant change in 
enzymatic production also reported in different cultural 
conditions of some fungi (B. adusta R59) (14). Sometimes, the 
production and stability of peroxidases gets compromised 
during agitation (22, 25, 46, 56). In a few instances, agitation 
might not help the production of certain fungal (Irpex lacteus) 
peroxidases (Mn-Dependent) unless specific nutrients (0.1% 
Tween 80) are incorporated into the medium (49). So, the 
possibility of fungal degradation of dyes under static condition 
(25, 43) can never be overlooked all together. This idea of 
using static cultures can be employed for large-scale lagoons 
used in the treatment of colored effluents (41).   913Ali, N. et al.                Brown-rot fungi in the bioremoval of azo dyes 
 
 
Decolorization of different dyes takes about 5–30 days 
(28, 30, 33, 36), moreover, it is often correlated with the 
production of different ligninolytic enzymes by different fungi 
(39, 44). Results from the present study seem to be certainly 
falling within this wide range of time (dyes removal was not 
100% within the stipulated time i.e., 192 hrs) (Table 2, 3). 
Decolorization rate though varied in different combinations; of 
dyes and fungi but was generally high in the initial 96 hrs. 
Moreover, it kept on declining with passing time in agitated 
fungal cultures. Machado et al. (28) also reported this 
decreasing trend in decolorization with time. This phenomenon 
might be due to accumulation of dyes products that might have 
hindered growth and metabolizing potential of the fungi (28, 
45, 56).  
Results of present study clearly shows that bioremoval of 
dyes cannot simply be linked to the White-rot fungi. Other 
groups of fungi, like Brown-rots can also play a significant role 
in the bioremediation of recalcitrant aromatics like dyes. 
Fungal dyes removal capabilities proved to be falling into two 
main categories; i.e., Biosorption and Biodegradation. Fungal 
dyes removal is mostly considered through extra-cellular 
fungal peroxidases. However, further research on 
understanding the mechanism of dyes reduction 
(decolorization) after taken up onto the fungal biomass would 
help in the advancement of bioremediation technologies.
