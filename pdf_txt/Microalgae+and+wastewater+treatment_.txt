Wastewater treatmentAbstract Organic and inorganic substances which were released into the environment as a result of
domestic, agricultural and industrial water activities lead to organic and inorganic pollution. The
normal primary and secondary treatment processes of these wastewaters have been introduced ina growing number of places, in order to eliminate the easily settled materials and to oxidize the
organic material present in wastewater. The ﬁnal result is a clear, apparently clean efﬂuent which
is discharged into natural water bodies. This secondary efﬂuent is, however, loaded with inorganicnitrogen and phosphorus and causes eutrophication and more long-term problems because ofrefractory organics and heavy metals that are discharged. Microalgae culture offers an interesting
step for wastewater treatments, because they provide a tertiary biotreatment coupled with the
production of potentially valuable biomass, which can be used for several purposes. Microalgae cul-tures offer an elegant solution to tertiary and quandary treatments due to the ability of microalgae
to use inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus for their growth. And also, for their capacity to remove
heavy metals, as well as some toxic organic compounds, therefore, it does not lead to secondarypollution. In the current review we will highlight on the role of micro-algae in the treatment of
wastewater.

1. Introduction
It is truism nowadays to recognize that pollution associated
problems are a major concern of society. Environmental laws
are given general applicability and their enforcement has beenincreasingly stricter. So, in terms of health, environment and
economy, the ﬁght against pollution has become a major issue.
Today, although the strategic importance of fresh water is
universally recognized more than ever before, and although
issues concerning sustainable water management can be found
almost in every scientiﬁc, social, or political agenda all over theworld, water resources seem to face severe quantitative andqualitative threats. The pollution increase, industrialization
and rapid economic development, impose severe risks to
availability and quality of water resources, in many areasworldwide.
The problems of water shortage in the Middle East and
North Africa (MENA) regions are well documented. Mostcountries in this region are arid or semi-arid. They have low
rainfall, mostly with seasonal and erratic distribution. The
MENA region, home up to 5% of the world’s people containsless than 1% of the world’s annual renewable freshwater. On
the other hand, water demand in arid and semi-arid countries
is growing fast. The population, having more than doubled inthe past 30 years to about 280 million, could double again inthe next 30 years. Cities’ growing at more than 4% a year al-ready contain 60% of the region’s people. As population has
grown against a background of ﬁnite freshwater resources,so the water available to individuals has fallen dramatically.
Annual per capita availability, about 3300 cubic meters in
1960, has fallen by 60% to about 1250 cubic meters in 1995,the lowest in the world, and it is predicted to fall by another
50% to about 650 cubic meters by 2025.
For the region as a whole, agriculture is the largest user of
water (87%), while industry and domestic supplies consume7% and 8%, respectively ( El-Gohary, 2001; Samhan, 2008 ).
Water quality degradation is quickly joining water scarcity
as a major issue in the region. The relative severity of waterquality varies among Middle East countries according to a
number of factors, including population growth and density,
extent of industrialization quality of non-renewable water re-sources, economic situation and institutional capacity.
Pollution is a man-made phenomenon, arising either when
the concentrations of naturally occurring substances are in-creased or when non-natural synthetic compounds (xenobiot-
ics) are released into the environment. Organic and inorganic
substances which are released into the environment as a resultof domestic, agricultural and industrial water activities lead toorganic and inorganic pollution ( Mouchet, 1986; Lim et al.,
2010).
There are still a number of cases whereby municipal and
rural domestic wastewater is discharged directly into water-2 N. Abdel-Raouf et al.
Please cite this article in press as: Abdel-Raouf, N. et al., Microalgae and wastewater treatment. Saudi Journal of Biological
Sciences (2012), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2012.04.005ways, often without treatment. The discharges are increasing
year after year due to the existing plan for water supply net-
works set-up in many villages. Also, the present expansion ofwater networks in several towns without parallel constructionof new sewage systems or rehabilitation of the existing ones
aggravated the problems and lead to pollution problems of
the water bodies and increasing public health hazards. Theconstituents of domestic and urban input to water resources
are pathogens, nutrients, suspended solids, salts and oxygen
demanding materials.
One of the major sources of water pollution is the uncon-
trolled discharge of human wastes, while some countries have
made massive investment in water supply projects there hasbeen an overall under-investment in appropriate sanitation
systems, which has resulted in harmful contamination of water
resources, increased ﬂooding and reduced health beneﬁts fromwater investments. Finding a solution for the treatment andsafe discharge of the wastewater is a difﬁcult challenge because
it entails integrated processes in which technical, economic and
ﬁnancial consideration come in play. The uniqueness of eachsituation makes it difﬁcult to deﬁne a universal method for
selecting the most adequate type of waste treatment plant.
However, it is important to ensure that appropriate treatmentstandards are selected to meet local conditions, and alternative
innovative technologies for treating wastewater are considered.
Both conventional and innovative methods should beevaluated.
Overall the agricultural drains receive the bulk of the treated
and untreated domestic pollution load. As a result many canals
now also are contaminated with wastewater pollutants. A partfrom being the largest consumer of water, agriculture is also a
major water polluter. Saline irrigation return-ﬂows or drainage
containing agrochemical residues are serious contaminants fordownstream water users. Agricultural nitrate is contaminating
groundwater. The disposal of liquid animal waste pollutes sur-
face and groundwater, etc. This means a large number of or-ganic and inorganic substances disturb the water quality,
which are the main causes of eutrophication of the water body.
They also proved to be powerful stimulants to algal growth andconsequently formation of ‘‘algal blooms’’. Algal blooms canaffect the water quality in several ways.
2. Composition of typical wastewater
Watercourses receive pollution from many different sources,
which vary both in strength and volume. The composition ofwastewater is a reﬂection of the life styles and technologies
practiced in the producing society ( Gray, 1989 ). It is a complex
mixture of natural organic and inorganic materials as well asman-made compounds. Three quarters of organic carbon in
sewage are present as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, amino
acids, and volatile acids. The inorganic constituents includelarge concentrations of sodium, calcium, potassium, magne-
sium, chlorine, sulphur, phosphate, bicarbonate, ammonium
salts and heavy metals ( Tebbutt, 1983; Horan, 1990; Lim
et al., 2010 ).
Different sources of pollutants include ‘‘Discharge of
either raw or treated sewage from towns and villages; dis-
charge from manufacturing or industrial plants; run-off fromagricultural land; and leachates from solid waste disposal
sites’’ these sites of pollution have problems so that a solu-
tion is sought ( Horan, 1990 ). Scarcity of water, the need
for energy and food are forcing us to explore the feasibility
of wastewater recycling and resource recovery ( De la Nou ¨e
and De Pauw, 1988 ).
3. Microbiological composition of sewage
Wastewater environment is an ideal media for a wide range of
microorganisms specially bacteria, viruses and protozoa. The
majority is harmless and can be used in biological sewage treat-
ment, but sewage also contains pathogenic microorganisms,
Figure 1 Wastewater treatment station model.Microalgae and wastewater treatment 3

Sciences (2012), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2012.04.005which are excreted in large numbers by sick individuals and a
symptomic carrier. Bacteria which cause cholera, typhoid and
tuberculosis; viruses which cause infectious hepatitis; protozoawhich cause dysentery and the eggs of parasitic worms are allfound in sewage ( Glynn Henery, 1989; Shaaban et al., 2004 ).
The efﬁciency of disinfecting sewage is generally estimated by
the extent of removal of total coliform organisms ( Sebastian
and Nair, 1984 ).
4. Sewage treatment processes
4.1. Conventional sewage treatment technology
In the wastewater treatment system ( Fig. 1 ), the removal of
biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), suspended solids, nutri-ents (NO
/C0
3/C0N;NO/C0
2/C0N;NHþ
4/C0N and PO3/C0
4/C0PÞ, coliform
bacteria, and toxicity are the main goal for getting puriﬁed
wastewater. BOD exploits the ability of microorganisms tooxidize organic material to CO
2and water using molecular
oxygen as an oxidizing agent. Therefore, BOD can deplete
the dissolved oxygen of receiving water leading to ﬁsh kills
and anaerobiosis, hence its removal is a primary aim of waste-water treatment. Suspended solids are removed principally by
physical sedimentation.
In wastewater treatment systems designed to remove nutri-
ents, mainly dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus, is becoming
an important step of treatment. Discharge of these nutrients
into sensitive water bodies leads to eutrophication by stimulat-ing the growth of unwanted plants such as algae and aquatic
macrophytes. Other consequences of nitrogen compounds in
wastewater efﬂuents are toxicity of non-ionized ammonia toﬁsh and other aquatic organisms, interference with disinfectionwhere a free chlorine residual is required and methemoglobine-
mia in inﬂuents due to excessive nitrate concentrations (above
45 g/m
3) in drinking water ( Lincolin and Earle, 1990 ). It has
been concluded that single unit process is currently unavailable
which can successfully and efﬁciently achieve all these require-
ments and consequently a combination is required ( Horan,
1990).
4.2. Preliminary treatment of sewage
The preliminary treatment of sewage removes large solid mate-
rials delivered by sewers that could obstruct ﬂow through the
plant or damage equipment. These materials are composedof ﬂoating objects such as rags, wood, fecal material and hea-
vier grit particles. Large ﬂoating objects can be removed by
passing the sewage through bars spaced at 20–60 mm, theretained material is raked from the bars at regular intervals
(Tebbutt, 1983 ). Grit is removed by reducing the ﬂow velocity
to a range at which grit and silt will settle, but leave organicmatter in suspension, this is usually in the velocity range of
0.2–0.4 m/s ( Gray, 1989 ).
4.3. Primary treatment of sewage
After removal of the coarse materials, sewage passes to sedi-
mentation tanks, which aim to remove the settleable solids(represent up to 70% of the total settleable solids) by gravity.
A well designed sedimentation tank can remove 40% of the
BOD in the form of settleable solids ( Horan, 1990 ). Pathogen
removal during primary treatment is highly varied with variousremoval rates reported for different organisms ( Pescod, 1986;
Gray, 1989; IAWPRC study group, 1991 ).
4.4. Secondary treatment of sewage
The secondary treatment process aims to reduce the BOD ex-
erted by reducing organic matter. This is mediated, primarily,by a mixed population of heterotrophic bacteria that utilize the
organic constituent for energy and growth.
A large number of biological unit operations are available
to achieve the aerobic oxidation of BOD. All operations can
be classiﬁed on the basis of their microbial population, into
either ﬁxed ﬁlm or dispersed growth processes. Fixed ﬁlm reac-tors have bioﬁlms attached to a ﬁxed surface where organic
compounds are adsorbed into the bioﬁlm and aerobically de-
graded. In suspended (e.g. activated sludge) growth reactorsthe microorganisms mix freely with the wastewater and arekept in suspension by mechanical agitation or mixing by air
diffusers ( Horan, 1990 ).
Several investigators have pointed out that biological oxi-
dation systems can remove over 90% of pathogenic bacteria
from sewage, however, the removal of viruses is much more
varied. The major mechanism of viral removal is thought tobe adsorption. In suspended growth reactors the intimate
mixing of solid ﬂocs and sewage gives 90% removal, while
the smaller surface areas of biological adsorption sites in ﬁlmreactors give varied reductions ( Kott et al., 1974; Lloyd and
Morris, 1983; Gray, 1989; IAWPRC Study Group, 1991 ).
4.5. Tertiary treatment of sewage
Tertiary treatment process aims to remove all organic ions. It
can be accomplished biologically or chemically. The biologicaltertiary treatment process appears to perform well when com-
pared to the chemical processes which are in general too costly
to be implemented in most places and which may lead to sec-ondary pollution. In addition, each additional treatment step
in a wastewater system greatly increases the total cost ( Oswald,
1988b ).
A complete tertiary process aimed at removing ammonium,
nitrate and phosphate is estimated to be about four times more
expensive than primary treatment ( De la Nou ¨e et al., 1992 ).
Quaternary treatment intended for the removal of heavy met-als, organic compounds (refactory and toxicants) and soluble
minerals will be about eight to sixteen times more expensive
than that of primary treatment, respectively ( Oswald, 1988b ).
Advanced treatments are generally based on technologi-
cally complex techniques, such as chemical precipitation, ozon-
ation, reverse osmosis or carbon adsorption. These techniquesinclude processes designed to remove particular nutrients, such
as phosphorus or nitrogen, which can stimulate eutrophication
in certain situations. For general improvements in efﬂuentquality, especially in small-scale applications, the removal ofﬁne particles can enable discharges below the target standards.
Such systems include lagoon storage, land application and ﬁl-
tration through sand or gravel ﬁlters ( Gray, 1989 ).
Some industrial and agricultural wastewater show total
nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations up to three orders
of magnitude higher than natural water bodies ( De la Nou ¨e
et al., 1992 ). The normal primary and secondary treatment
processes have been introduced in a growing number of places,
in order to eliminate the easily settled materials (primary treat-4 N. Abdel-Raouf et al.
Please cite this article in press as: Abdel-Raouf, N. et al., Microalgae and wastewater treatment. Saudi Journal of Biological
Sciences (2012), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2012.04.005ment) and to oxidize the organic material present in wastewa-
ter (secondary treatment). The ﬁnal result is a clear, apparently
clean efﬂuent which is discharged into natural water bodies.This secondary efﬂuent is, however, loaded with inorganicnitrogen and phosphorus and causes eutrophication and more
long-term problems because of refractory organics and heavy
metals that are discharged.
Dasilva et al. (1987) , stated that, the natural puriﬁcation
processes identiﬁed chemoorganotrophic micro-organisms
which being responsible for the destruction of the organic mat-ter and also showed that both aerobic and anaerobic processes
were operating. They also indicated that, the modern methods
of the biological wastewater treatment systems still rely on thesame types of self puriﬁcation as those at work in the natural
environment. The difference is that they are contained within
installations designed to speed up the rate of treatment.
4.6. Disinfection of wastewater
Primary, secondary and even tertiary treatment cannot by ex-
pected to remove 100% of the incoming waste load and as a
result, many organisms still remain in the waste stream. To
prevent the spread of waterborne diseases and also to minimizepublic health problems, regulatory agencies may require the
destruction of pathogenic organisms in wastewaters. While
most of these microorganisms are not pathogens, pathogensmust be assumed to be potentially present. Thus, wheneverwastewater efﬂuents are discharged into receiving waters which
may be used for water supply, swimming or shellﬁshing, the
reduction of bacterial numbers to minimize health hazards isa very desirable goal. Disinfection is the treatment of the efﬂu-
ent for the destruction of all pathogens. Another term that is
sometimes also used in describing the destruction of microor-ganisms is sterilization . Sterilization is the destruction of all
microorganisms. While disinfection indicates the destruction
of all disease causing microorganisms, no attempt is made inwastewater treatment to obtain sterilization. However, disin-
fection procedures applied to wastewaters will result in a sub-
stantial reduction of all microbes so that bacterial numbers arereduced to a safe level. In general, disinfection can be achievedby any method that destroys pathogens. A variety of physical
or chemical methods are capable of destroying microorgan-
isms under certain conditions. Physical methods might include,for example, heating to boiling or incineration or irradiation
with X-rays or ultraviolet rays. Chemical methods might theo-
retically include the use of strong acids, alcohols, or a varietyof oxidizing chemicals or surface active agents (such as special
detergents). However, the treatment of wastewaters for the
destruction of pathogens demands the use of practical mea-sures that can be used economically and efﬁciently at all times
on large quantities of wastewaters which have been treated to
various degrees. In the past, wastewater treatment practiceshave principally relied on the use of chlorine for disinfection.The prevalent use of chlorine has come about because chlorine
is an excellent disinfecting chemical and, until recently, has
been available at a reasonable cost. However, the rising costof chlorine coupled with the fact that chlorine even at low
concentrations is toxic to ﬁsh and other biota as well as the
possibility that potentially harmful chlorinated hydrocarbonsmay be formed has made chlorination less favored as the
disinfectant of choice in wastewater treatment. As a result,
the increased use of ozone (ozonation) or ultraviolet light asa disinfectant in the future is a distinct possibility in wastewa-
ter disinfection. Both ozone and ultraviolet light, as well as
being an effective disinfecting agent, leave no toxic residual.Ozone will additionally raise the dissolved oxygen level ofwater. However, ozone must be generated and has only re-
cently begun to compete favorably with chlorination in terms
of economics. Ultraviolet light has recently undergone studiesto determine its effectiveness and cost when used at large
wastewater treatment plants. While the study is not yet com-
plete, ultraviolet light now appears effective and economicallycompetitive with chlorination as a disinfectant. The use of
both chlorine and ozone as chemical disinfectants and their
disinfecting properties and actions will be considered individu-ally. However, since chlorine continues to be used extensively
as a disinfectant, we will mainly be concerned with the princi-
ples and practice of chlorination.
4.7. Aquatic systems for wastewater treatment
Serious interests in natural methods for wastewater treatment
have reemerged. The using of aquaculture systems as engi-
neered systems in wastewater (domestic and industrial) treat-
ment and recycling has increased enormously over the pastfew years, they are designed to achieve speciﬁc wastewater
treatment and can simultaneously solve the environmental
and sanitary problems and may also be economically efﬁcient(Bastian and Reed, 1979; O’Brien, 1981; Oron et al., 1985;
Hussein et al., 2004; Deng et al., 2006 ).
Wastewater has been also used in a variety of aquaculture
operations around the world for the production of ﬁsh or otherbiomass. Usually the production of biomass was a primary
goal with marginal concern for wastewater renovation ( Reed,
1987). The intensive growth and consequent harvesting of
the algal biomass as a method for removing wastewater borne
nutrients was ﬁrst suggested and studied by Bogan et al.
(1960) . It was further investigated by Oswald and Golueke
(1966) who proposed the removal of algae growth potential
from wastewater by high-rate algal treatment. Large scale
study in South Africa, reported by Bosman and Hendricks
(1980) concerning the removal of industrial nitrogenous wastes
with high-rate algal ponds concluded that a multi-stage algal
system is required for exerting the full removal potential of
nitrogen by algal biomass incorporation followed by algalharvesting.
Aquatic treatment systems consist of one or more shallow
ponds in which one or more species of water tolerant vascularplants such as water hyacinths or duckweed are grown
(Tchobanoglous, 1987 ). Water hyacinth systems are capable
of removing high levels of BOD, suspended solids (SS), nitro-gen and refractory trace organic matter ( Orth and Sapkota,
1988) while phosphorus removal seldom exceeds 50–70% in
wastewater, as it is mainly limited to the plant uptake ( Dinges,
1976; Bastian and Reed, 1979 ).
A system consisting of a pond covered with duckweed mat
seems to be able to purify the wastewater jointly with bacteria.
The bacterial decomposition causes anaerobiosis in the water.It is maintained by the duckweed mat as it prevents reaeration.
It has been shown that duckweed species such as Spirodela and
Lemna even reduce the oxygen content of water ( Culley and
Epps, 1973 ) but this anaerobiosis dose not seem to affect the
plants ( Agami et al., 1976 ). The main minerals C, N and P
in turn will be converted into protein by duckweed, also, itMicroalgae and wastewater treatment 5

Sciences (2012), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2012.04.005has the ability to remove the organic materials because of their
ability to use simple organic compounds directly and assimi-
late them as carbohydrates and various amino acids ( Hillman,
1976).
In aquatic systems used for municipal wastewater the carbo-
naceous biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and the suspended
solids (SS) are removed principally by bacterial metabolism andphysical sedimentation. In systems used to treat BOD and SS,
the aquatic plants themselves bring about very little actual
treatments of wastewater ( Tchobanoglous, 1987 ).
Many investigations have been conducted and concern the
distribution and species composition of fresh water algal com-
munities in different water supplies in Egypt in response to theimpact of some environmental stresses ( Abdel-Raouf et al.,
2003). The polluted rivers, lakes and seas, were aesthetically
displeasing also by Man which importantly were a publichealth hazard, since they harboured human pathogens and in-creased the risk of spreading excreta-related diseases through
the water-borne route. In order to prevent such problems,
the sewage treatment systems were designed.
Through most of human history, agriculture has been in ef-
fect a major form of biological water treatments through its
use of the potential pollutants of human and animal wastesto support plant growth. Municipal sewage, for example some-
times after treatment is applied as a source of nutrients over
land occupied by natural vegetation or various crops ( Hunt
and Lee, 1976; Wood-Well, 1977 ). Such wastes are still impor-
tant in world agriculture, especially where commercial fertiliz-
ers are not readily available ( Tourbier and Pierson, 1979 ).
5. Microalgae for wastewater treatment
The history of the commercial use of algal cultures spans
about 75 years with application to wastewater treatment
and mass production of different strains such as Chlorella
and Dunaliella . Currently signiﬁcant interest is developed in
some advanced world nations such as Australia, USA, Thai-
land, Taiwan and Mexico ( Borowitzka and Borowitzka, 1988,
1989a,b; Moreno et al., 1990; Wong and Chan, 1990; Renaudet al., 1994 ). These are due to the understanding of the biol-
ogists in these nations for the biology and ecology of large-
scale algal cultures, as well as in the engineering of large-scaleculture systems and algal harvesting methods, all of which areimportant to the design and operation of high rate algal cul-
tures to produce high-value products, such as Pharmaceuti-
cals and genetically engineered products ( Javanmardian and
Palsson, 1991 ). These include antibacterial, antiviral, antitum-
ers/anticancer, antihistamine and many other biologically
valuable products ( Starr et al., 1962; Borowitzka, 1991;
Ibraheem, 1995; Haroun et al., 1995 ).
Bio-treatment with microalgae is particularly attractive be-
cause of their photosynthetic capabilities, converting solar en-ergy into useful biomasses and incorporating nutrients such
as nitrogen and phosphorus causing eutrophication ( De la
Nou¨e and De Pauw, 1988 ). This fascinating idea launched some
ﬁfty-ﬁve years ago in the U.S. by Oswald and Gotaas (1957) has
since been intensively tested in many countries ( Goldman,
1979; Shelef and Soeder, 1980; De Pauw and Van Vaerenbergh,
1983).
Palmer (1974) surveyed microalgal genera from a wide dis-
tribution of waste stabilization ponds. In order of abundance,
and frequency of occurrence the algae found were Chlorella,Ankistrodesmus, Scenedesmus, Euglena, Chlamydomonas,
Oscillatoria, Micractinium andGolenkinia .
A survey of algal taxa in six-lagoon systems in Central Asia
was completed by Erganshev and Tajiev (1986) . Their analysis
of long term data revealed that the Chlorophyta was dominant
both in variety and quantity followed by Cyanophyta, Bas-
cillariophyta and Euglenophyta. Palmer (1969) listed the algae
in the order of their tolerance to organic pollutants as reported
by 165 authors. The list was compiled for 60 genera and 80
species. The most tolerant eight genera were found to beEuglena ,Oscillatoria ,Chlamydomonas
,Scenedesmus ,Chlorella ,
Nitzschia ,Navicula andStigeoclonium . More than 1000 algal
taxa have been reported one or more times as pollution tolerantwhich include 240 genera, 725 species and 125 varieties and
forms. The most tolerant genera include eight green algae, ﬁve
blue-greens, six ﬂagellates and six diatoms.
Since the land-space requirements of microalgal wastewater
treatment systems are substantial ( De Pauw and Van Vaeren-
bergh, 1983 ), efforts are being made to develop wastewater
treatment systems based on the use of hyperconcentrated algalcultures. This proved to be highly efﬁcient in removing N and
P within very short periods of times, e.g. less than 1 h ( Lavoie
and De la Nou ¨e, 1985 ).
The algal systems can treat human sewage ( Shelef et al.,
1980; Mohamed, 1994; Ibraheem, 1998 ), livestock wastes ( Lin-
coln and Hill, 1980 ), agro-industrial wastes ( Zaid-Iso,1990;
Ma et al.,1990; Phang, 1990, 1991 ) and industrial wastes ( Kap-
lan et al., 1988 ). Also, microalgal systems for the treatment of
other wastes such as piggery efﬂuent ( De Pauw et al., 1980;
Martin et al., 1985a,b andPouliot et al., 1986 ), the efﬂuent
from food processing factories ( Rodrigues and Oliveira,
1987) and other agricultural wastes ( Phang and Ong,1988 )
have been studied. Also, algae based system for the removalof toxic minerals such as lead, cadmium, mercury, scandium,
tin, arsenic and bromine are also being developed ( Soeder
et al., 1978; Kaplan et al., 1988; Gerhardt et al., 1991; Hammo-uda et al., 1995; Cai-XiaoHua et al., 1995 ).
The technology and biotechnology of microalgal mass cul-
ture have been much discussed ( Burlew, 1953; Barclay and
Mc-Intosh, 1986; Richmond, 1986; Lembi and Waaland,1988; Stadler et al., 1988 andCresswell et al., 1989 ). Algal sys-
tems have traditionally been employed as a tertiary process
(Lavoie and De la Nou ¨e, 1985; Martin et al., 1985a; Oswald,
1988b ). They have been proposed as a potential secondary
treatment system ( Tam and Wong, 1989 ).
Tertiary treatment process removes all organic ions. It can
be accomplished biologically or chemically. The biological
tertiary treatment appears to perform well compared to the
chemical processes which are in general too costly to be imple-mented in most places and which may lead to secondary pollu-
tion. However, each additional treatment step in a wastewater
system greatly increases the total cost. The relative cost oftreatment doubles for each additional step following primarytreatment ( Oswald, 1988b ).
A complete tertiary process aimed at removing ammonia,
nitrate and phosphate will thus be about four times moreexpensive than primary treatment. Microalgal cultures offer
an elegant solution to tertiary and quinary treatments due to
the ability of microalgae to use inorganic nitrogen and phos-phorus for their growth ( Richmond, 1986; Oswald, 1988b,c;
Garbisu et al., 1991, 1993; Tam and Wong, 1995 ). And also,
their capacity to remove heavy metals ( Rai et al., 1981 ), as well6 N. Abdel-Raouf et al.

Sciences (2012), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2012.04.005as some toxic organic compounds ( Redalje et al., 1989 ), there-
fore, does not lead to secondary pollution. Amongst beneﬁcial
characteristics they produce oxygen, have a disinfecting effectdue to increase in pH during photosynthesis ( Mara and Pear-
son, 1986; De la Nou ¨e and De Pauw, 1988 ).
Algae can be used in wastewater treatment for a range of
purposes, some of which are used for the removal of coliformbacteria, reduction of both chemical and biochemical oxygen
demand, removal of N and/or P, and also for the removal of
heavy metals.
6. Removal of coliform bacteria
Moawad (1968) observed that the environmental factors which
were favourable for algal growth were unfavourable for the
survival of coliforms. Pathogenic organisms of concern inwastewater include bacteria such as Salmonella andShigella ,
viruses and protozoa. Bacteria provide the largest component
of the microbial community in all biological wastewater treat-ment processes and numbers in the range of 10
6bacteria/ml of
wastewater are frequently encountered ( Horan, 1990 ). Experi-
mental evidence indicates that, the pathogenic bacteria gener-
ally have shorter survival times in the environment thancoliforms, whereas viruses tend to survive longer.
The efﬁciency of disinfection of sewage is generally esti-
mated by the extent of removal of total coliform organisms(Sebastian and Nair, 1984 ). In this respect sewage stabilization
ponds and high-rate sewage stabilization ponds are well
known for being generally more effective than conventionalsewage treatment systems ( Parhad and Rao, 1976; Shelef
et al., 1977 ).
Reports in the literature revealed that, considerable coli-
form removal is achieved in stabilization ponds. Thus Malina
and Yousef (1964) reported a reduction of 88.8% in 11.4 days.
Meron et al. (1965) reported a reduction of 99.6%. Another
supported study was performed in this respect ( Oswald et al.,
1967; Parhad and Rao, 1976 ).
In high-rate ponds, Shelef et al. (1977) have reported a
reduction of 99% in total coliform counts. A similar observa-tion on the percent reduction of coliforms and Salmonella was
also made by Cooke et al. (1978), Pichai and Govindan (1980)
andColak and Kaya (1988) .
7. Reduction of both chemical and biochemical oxygen demand
As mentioned before, there are many compounds and micro-
organisms could be detected in wastewater, which is capable
of causing the pollution of a water-course. Pollution of
wastewater may be manifested in three broad categories,namely organic materials, inorganic materials in addition to
microbial contents. The organic compounds of wastewater
comprise a large number of compounds, which all have atleast one carbon atom. These carbon atoms may be oxidized
both chemically and biologically to yield carbon dioxide. If
biological oxidation is employed the test is termed the Bio-chemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), whereas for chemical oxi-
dation, the test is termed Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD).
In other words, BOD exploits the ability of microorganismsto oxidise organic material to carbon dioxide and water usingmolecular oxygen as an oxidizing agent. Therefore, biochem-
ical oxygen demand is a measure of the respiratory demandof bacteria metabolizing the organic matter present in
wastewater.
Excess BOD can deplete the dissolved oxygen of receiving
water leading to ﬁsh kills and anaerobiosis, hence its removalis a primary aim of wastewater treatment. Colak and Kaya
(1988) investigated the possibilities of biological wastewater
treatment by algae. They found that, in domestic wastewatertreatment, elimination of BOD and COD were 68.4% and
67.2%, respectively.
8. Removal of N and/or P
The bio-treatment of wastewater with algae to remove nutri-
ents such as nitrogen and phosphorus and to provide oxygen
for aerobic bacteria was proposed over 50 years ago by Oswald
and Gotaas (1957) . Since then there have been numerous lab-
oratory and pilot studies of this process and several sewage
treatment plants using various versions of this systems have
been constructed ( Shelef et al., 1980; Oswald, 1988a,b; Shi
et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2008 ).
The nitrogen in sewage efﬂuent arises primarily from meta-
bolic interconversions of extraderived compounds, whereas
50% or more of phosphorus arises from synthetic detergents.The principal forms in which they occur in wastewater are
NH
þ
4(ammonia), NO/C0
2(nitrite), NO/C03(nitrate) and PO3/C0
4
(orthophosphate). Together these two elements are known as
nutrients and their removal is known as nutrient stripping
(Horan, 1990 ).
Wastewater is mainly treated by aerobic or anaerobic bio-
logical degradation; however, the treated water still containsinorganic compounds such as nitrate, ammonium and phos-
phate ions, which leads to eutrophication in lakes and cause
harmful microalgal blooms ( Sawayama et al., 1998 ).Prased
(1982) andGeddes (1984) have considered P and N to be the
key of eutrophication. So, further treatment is thus necessary
to prevent eutrophication of water environment ( Sawayama
et al., 2000 ).
The adverse effects of nutrient enrichment in receiving sen-
sitive bodies of water can cause eutrophication by stimulatingthe growth of unwanted plants such as algae and aquatic mac-
rophytes. Other consequences of nitrogen compounds in
wastewater efﬂuents are toxicity of non-ionized ammonia toﬁsh and other aquatic organisms, interference with disinfectionwhere a free chlorine residual is required and methemoglobine-
mia in inﬂuents due to excessive nitrate concentrations (above
45 g m
/C03) in drinking water ( Lincolin and Earle, 1990 ).
Microalgal culture offers a cost-effective approach to
removing nutrients from wastewater (tertiary wastewater treat-
ment) ( Evonne and Tang, 1997 ). Microalgae have a high
capacity for inorganic nutrient uptake ( Talbot and De la
Nou¨e, 1993; Blier et al., 1995 ) and they can be grown in mass
culture in outdoor solar bio-reactors ( De la Nou ¨e et al., 1992 ).
Biological processes appear to perform well compared to the
chemical and physical processes, which are in general, too
costly to be implemented in most places and which may leadto secondary pollution ( De la Nou ¨e et al., 1992 ).
Microalgal cultures offer an elegant solution to tertiary and
quaternary treatments due to the ability of microalgae to use
inorganic nitrogen and phosphorous for their growth ( Oswald,
1988b,c; Richmond, 1986 ) and their capacity to remove heavy
metals ( Rai et al., 1981 ).Lau et al. (1996) studied the ability ofMicroalgae and wastewater treatment 7
Please cite this article in press as: Abdel-Raouf, N. et al., Microalgae and wastewater treatment. Saudi Journal of Biological
Sciences (2012), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2012.04.005Chlorella vulgaris in nutrients removal and reported a nutrient
removal efﬁciency of 86% for inorganic N and 78% for inor-
ganic P. In earlier study, Colak and Kaya (1988) reported an
elimination of nitrogen (50.2%) and phosphorus (85.7%) inindustrial wastewater treatment and elimination of phospho-
rus (97.8%) in domestic wastewater treated by algae.
In reported papers, Lau et al. (1996) studied the ability of
Chlorella vulgaris in the removal of nutrients. They found that
the results indicated in a nutrient removal efﬁciency of 86%
inorganic N and 70% inorganic P. In earlier study, Colak
and Kaya (1988) reported an elimination of nitrogen
(50.2%) and phosphorus (85.7%) in industrial wastewater
treatment and elimination of phosphorus (97.8%) in domesticwastewater treated by algae.
The interest in microalgal cultures stems from the fact that
conventional treatment processes suffer from some importantdisadvantages: (a) variable efﬁciency depending upon thenutrient to be removed; (b) costly to operate; (c) the chemical
processes often lead to secondary pollution; and (d) loss of
valuable potential nutrients (N, P) ( De la Nou ¨e et al., 1992 ).
The last disadvantage is especially serious, because conven-
tional treatment processes lead to incomplete utilization of
natural resources ( Guterstan and Todd, 1990; Phang, 1990 ).
Many studies demonstrated the success of using algal cul-
tures to remove nutrients from wastewater rich in nitrogenous
and phosphorus compounds ( Przytocka-Jusiak et al., 1984;
Rodrigues and Oliveira, 1987 ).Mohamed (1994) pointed out
thatScenedesmus sp. is very common in all kinds of fresh water
bodies, which play an important role as primary producers and
contributes to the puriﬁcation of eutrophic waters. The authorindicated that the presence or absence of certain species of
Scenedesmus can be used for the evaluation of water quality.
To avoid recycling of nutrients in receiving waters, and to re-cover the biomass produced, harvesting or physical recovery of
the algal cells is also essential, and represents one of the impor-
tant technical and economic difﬁculties to overcome ( Bene-
mann, 1989 ). Indeed, most of the experiments carried out
until now have used planktonic and unicellular microalgal spe-
cies which are difﬁcult to harvest ( Mohn, 1980; De la Nou ¨e
and De Pauw, 1988 ).
Removal of inorganic compounds by using plants or micro-
algae has advantages of renewability and utilization of solar
energy ( Sawayama et al., 1998 ). Under suitable conditions,
cyanobacteria can grow at higher rates than higher plants
(Watanabe and Hall, 1996 ), so that inorganic nutrients-
removal systems using cyanobacteria appear to have a consid-erable potential ( Sawayama et al., 1998 ). With the increasing
use of inorganic nitrogenous fertilizers and the production of
wastes from human and animal populations, there are signsof nitrogen (N) accumulation in the environment, in the case
of N pollution, most concern stems from the possible health
hazards that have been attributed to nitrite either directly asa causative factor of methemoglobinemia or indirectly as thesource of nitrosamines ( Tam and Wong, 1989 ).
Also, nitrites themselves are important as precursors of
N-nitroso compounds, mainly nitrosamines, which havereceived considerable attention due to their possible carcino-
genic, teratogenic and mutagenic properties ( Abel, 1989 ). Since
nitrate is not signiﬁcantly removed by conventional watertreatment, much research is focused on the development ofnew techniques for reducing nitrates in drinking water to toler-
able levels, i.e. <50 mg l
/C01(World Health Organization,
1970).
Biological N removal generally appears a valid option and
offers some advantages over tertiary chemical and physico-
chemical treatments ( Proulx and De la Nou ¨e, 1988 ).De la
Nou¨e and Basseres (1989) used cultures of Phormidium bohneri
for the removal of nitrates from the efﬂuents obtained after
anaerobic digestion of swine manure. Also, the removal of N
from polluted waters using bench-top bioreactors incorporat-ing the thermophilic cyanobacterium Phormidium laminosum
has been reported ( Garbisu et al., 1994 ). The usage of thermo-
philic cyanobacteria in wastewater puriﬁcation has advanta-ges, since contamination can be avoided because the
cyanobacterium is tolerant to high temperature and can be
treated at high temperatures (45 /C176C) (Sawayama et al., 1998 ).
Phormidium sp. cells were attached to chitosan ﬂakes and
used for removing N (ammonium, nitrate, nitrite) and ortho-
phosphate from urban secondary efﬂuents ( De la Nou ¨e and
Proulx, 1988 ). Although to date, phosphate in water does
not seem to present any problems for human health, phospho-
rus (P) removal from municipal and industrial wastewater is
required to protect water from eutrophication ( Comeau
et al., 1987 ). Biological P removal processes have been attract-
ing attention in the last three decades ( Shaaban et al., 2004 ).
It is well established that in N-sufﬁcient cells of cynobacte-
ria the uptake and reduction of nitrate is a photosyntheticallydriven process which is likely to implicate product(s) of the
incorporation of ammonium to carbon skeletons ( Flores
et al., 1980; Herrero et al., 1985; Romero et al., 1987 ). Also,
nitrate assimilation is affected by a number of environmental
and nutritional factors such as light, temperature, pH and car-
bon source availability, among others ( Serra et al., 1990 ).
Phosphorus and nitrogen metabolism is closely related as an
abundance of phosphorus is of little use if there is no nitrogen
and vice versa ( Garbisu et al., 1993 ).
The uptake of phosphate by cyanobacteria, which has al-
ready been characterized in several strains, is an apparent
hyperbolic function of the external phosphate concentration(Garbisu et al., 1993 ).
After the cyanobacteria have taken up the nutrients in the
efﬂuents, the puriﬁed water can be decanted and the cyanobac-
teria can then be harvested with ease ( Talbot et al., 1990; Pro-
ulx et al., 1994 ). Potential end uses of the harvested biomass
include the extraction of commercially valuable pigments
(Mumford and Miura, 1988; Glazer, 1994 ).
9. Factors affecting algal growth and nutrient removal
Algal growth and nutrient uptake are not only affected by the
availability of nutrients, they also depend on complex interac-
tions among physical factors such as pH ( Azov and Shelef,
1987), light intensity, temperature ( Talbot and De la Nou ¨e,
1993), and biotic factors. The ﬁrst biotic factor signiﬁcantly
inﬂuencing algal growth is the initial density, it is expected thatthe higher the algal density, the better the growth and the high-er the nutrient removal efﬁciency ( Lau et al., 1995 ). However,
the high algal density would lead to self-shading, an accumula-
tion of autoinhibitors, and a reduction in photosynthetic efﬁ-ciency ( Fogg, 1975; Darley, 1982 ).8 N. Abdel-Raouf et al.
Please cite this article in press as: Abdel-Raouf, N. et al., Microalgae and wastewater treatment. Saudi Journal of Biological
Sciences (2012), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2012.04.00510. Heavy metals removal from wastewater
Microalgae are known to sequester heavy metals ( Rai et al.,
1981). Discharge of toxic pollutants to waste water collection
systems has increased concurrently with society’s progressiveindustrialization.
Signiﬁcant concentrations of heavy metals and toxic organ-
ic compounds have been measured in municipal wastewater.
Consequently, the ability of wastewater treatment systems totolerate and remove toxicity is of considerable importance.
Microalgae are efﬁcient absorbers of heavy metals. Bioaccu-
mulation of metals by algae may create a feasible method forremediating wastewater contaminated with metals ( Nakajima
et al.,1981; Darnall et al., 1986 ). On the other hand advantages
of algae are that it may be grown in ponds with little nutri-tional input or maintenance.
Although the heavy metal contents in some drainage sys-
tems generally do not reach the proportions found in industrialefﬂuents, certainly not those of metal processing industries, theproblems caused by their presence, particularly in areas with
dense population, are of public concern. It is well established
that several marine and fresh water algae are able to take upvarious heavy metals selectively from aqueous media and to
accumulate these metals within their cells ( Afkar et al., 2010;
Kumar and Gaur, 2011; Chen et al., 2012 ).
Several authors concluded that this method, including the
separation of the metal-saturated algae from the medium, is
an economic method for removing heavy metals from waste-water, resulting in high quality reusable efﬂuent water ( Filip
et al., 1979; Shaaban et al., 2004; Kiran et al., 2007; Nasreen
et al., 2008; Bhat et al., 2008; Pandi et al., 2009 ). Numerous
species of algae (living and non-living cells) are capable ofsequestering signiﬁcant quantities of toxic heavy metal ions
from aqueous solutions. Algal metal sequestering processes oc-
cur by different mechanisms. This can be dependent on thealga, the metal ion species, the solution conditions and whether
the algal cells are living or nonliving. In living algal cells trace
nutrient metals (such as Co, Mo, Ca, Mg, Cu, Zn, Cr, Pb andSe) are accumulated intracellularly by active biological trans-
port ( Yee et al., 2004; Han et al., 2007; Ajjabi and Chouba,
2009; Tuzen and Sari, 2010; Yuce et al., 2010;Kiran andThanasekaran, 2011 ; Pipiska et al., 2011; Rajfur et al.,in press;
Singh et al., 2012 ).
Field experiments reported by Gale (1986) indicated that,
live photosynthetic microalgae have an effective role in metaldetoxiﬁcation of mine wastewater. By using cyanobacteria in
a system of artiﬁcial pools and meanders, 99% of dissolved
and particulate metals could be removed. Soeder et al. (1978)
showed that Coelastrum proboscideum absorbs 100% of lead
from 1.0 ppm solution with 20 h at 23 /C176C and about 90% after
only 1.5 h at 30 /C176C.
Cadmium was absorbed a little less efﬁciently, with about
60% of the cadmium being absorbed from a 40 ppb solution
after 24 h. McHardy and George (1990) like Vymazal (1984),
studied Cladophora glomerata in artiﬁcial freshwater channels
and found that, the algae were excellent accumulators of zinc.
There have also been reports of accumulation of Cu
2+,P b2+
and Cr3+as well as Ni2+,C d2+,C o2+,F e2+and Mn2+by
algae ( Chen et al., 2008; Gupta and Rastogi, 2008; Sari and
Tuzen, 2008; Pahlavanzadeh et al., 2010; Gupta et al., 2010;Chakraborty et al., 2011; Lourie and Gjengedal, 2011; Kumar
et al., 2012; Tastan et al., 2012; Piotrowska-Niczyporuk et al.,
2012).
Algae in experimental rice paddles were found to accumu-
late and concentrate Cd2+by a factor of about 1000 times
when compared to the ambient ( Reiniger, 1977; Liu et al.,
2009). Algae are also good accumulators of compounds such
as organochlorides and tributyl tin ( Payer and Runkel, 1978;
Wright and Weber, 1991 ). They have also been reported to
break down some of these compounds ( Lee, 1989; Wu and
Kosaric, 1991 ).
Baeza-Squiban et al. (1990) andSchimdt (1991) have shown
that the green alga Dunaliella bioculata produced an extracel-
lular esterase which degrades the pyrethroid insecticide Delta-
methrin. Algae have also been shown to degrade a range of
hydrocarbons such as those found in oily wastes ( Cerniglia
et al., 1980; Carpenter et al., 1989 ).
11. Algae as a monitor of water quality
During the last three decades several investigations have de-
scribed the algal bioassays in response to environmental per-
turbations and their use as indicative organisms of waterquality ( Mohamed, 1994 ). In 1959, Palmer published a com-
posite rating of organisms such as Euglena, Oscillatoria,
Chlamydomonas, Scenedesmus, Chlorella, Nitzschia andNavic-
ula, which could be used as indicators of water pollution,
whereas the presense of different organisms such as Lemanea,
Stigeoclonium and certain species of Micrasterias, Staurastrum,
Pinnularia, Meridion and Surirella would indicate that the
water sample would be considered unpolluted.
12. Alternative culture and treatment systems
12.1. Hyperconcentrated cultures
Hyperconcentrated cultures are cultures with an algal biomass
>1.5 g l
/C01. On a small-scale, experiments with hyperconcen-
trated cultures have shown that these can accelerate the re-
moval of nutrients compared to normal cultures. Algae for
such experiments are concentrated by ﬂocculation and settlingusing a ﬂocculent such as chitosan ( Lavoie and De la Nou ¨e,
1983; Morales et al., 1985 ). Cell concentrations of up to
1.9 g dry weight l
/C01have been obtained for Oscillatoria sp.
grown on sewage sludge ( Hashimoto and Furukawa, 1989 ).
Working with Scenedesmus obliquus cultures have shown
that great nitrogen removal was greatly accelerated for 1.9 g
dry weight l/C01cultures compared to normal density cultures
of 0.5 g dry weight l/C01(Lavoie and De la Nou ¨e, 1985 ). They
have also demonstrated that the rate of removal of ammonium
and phosphorous in these hyperconcentrated cultures was pro-portional to algal concentration and independent of the obvi-
ous light limitation due to self-shading. Although this work
has been carried out only on a small scale so far, the use ofsuch hyperconcentrated cultures would require smaller pond
areas, or would permit a reduced residence time, both of which
have potential advantages. The engineering and economicfeasibility of such systems on a large-scale remains to bedetermined.Microalgae and wastewater treatment 9

Sciences (2012), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2012.04.00512.2. Immobilized cell system
One of the major problems in the utilization of microalgae for
the biological tertiary treatment of wastewater is their recovery
from the treated efﬂuent ( Chevalier and De la Nou ¨e, 1985a,b ).
Among the ways of solving this problem which have been re-cently studied are immobilization techniques ( De la Nou ¨e
and Proulx, 1988 ). Immobilization appears to offer several
advantages in comparison with batch or continuous fermenta-tion where free microorganisms are used ( Hall and Rao, 1989 ).
Chevalier and De la Nou ¨e (1985a,b) found that k-carrageenan-
immobilized Scenedesmus cells were able to take up nitrogen
and phosphorus at rates similar to those of free microalgae.Immobilized living cells possess some advantages in compari-
son with suspended cells; for example, immobilized microalgae
on a suitable support simplify the treatment of liquid sub-stances because of the entrapment of living cells, which con-
tributes to increasing the cells retention time in the reactor
(Travieso et al., 1992 ). It will be interesting to conﬁrm the fea-
sibility of using immobilized microalgae and cyanobacteria for
removing nitrate, ammonium, and phosphate from high vol-
ume efﬂuent discharges. It has been reported that Phormidium
laminosum immobilized on polymer foam has the potential to
remove nitrate in a continuous-ﬂow system with uptake efﬁ-
ciencies above 90% ( De la Nou ¨e et al., 1990; Garbisu et al.,
1991; Travieso et al., 1992; Sawayama et al., 1998 ).Sawayama
et al. (1998) have reported that hollow ﬁber-immobilized
cyanobacterial systems are easy to construct and immobiliza-
tion does not take a long time. Also Markov et al. (1995) have
reported that high rates of hydrogen production are made pos-
sible by using immobilized cyanobacteria on hollow-ﬁber
immobilization systems could improve the removal efﬁciencyof inorganic nutrients from treated wastewater.
Direct generation of electricity has also been demonstrated
by immobilizing the cyanobacterial species Mastigocladus
(Ochiai et al., 1980 ) and Phormidium (Ochiai et al., 1983 )o n
SnO
2optically transparent electrodes.12.3. Dialysis cultures
In dialysis culture the algae are separated from the nutrient-
containing medium by a semi-permeable dialysis barrier.
Low molecular weight compounds diffuse across this barrier
in response to a concentration gradient ( Jensen, 1976; Marsot
et al., 1991 ). High cell density cultures can be maintained for
prolonged periods in system with a high membrane surface
area/culture volume ratio, and the algal cells show very efﬁ-cient rates of nutrient utilization ( Ney et al., 1981 andMarsot
et al., 1991 ). One advantage of dialysis culture is that they can
serve to exclude inhibitory substances and it also allows the
microbiologically pure culture of the algae. The latter is partic-ularly important for the production of high quality large hu-
man consumption. Such a system has, as yet, not been
applied to the use of wastewaters for algal culture, however,this type of system deserves critical evaluation.
12.4. Tubular photobioreactors
One of the most promising areas in the development of new
reactor types is the tubular photobioreactors ( Fig. 2 ). Basi-
cally, these reactors are a closed system consisting of a cleartube within which the algae grow. The algae are circulated
by means of a pump and the system also has a gas exchange
unit where CO
2can be added and photosynthetically produced
O2is stripped from the medium. If necessary, a heat exchanger
is also added to either cool (in tropical areas) or heat (in tem-
perate areas) the culture.
The concept of tubular reactors is not new. Simple reactors
were already tested by Davis et al. (1953) , and many of the
modern systems are derived from the work of Pirt et al.
(1983) , although similar system had been used in Czechoslova-
kia at Trebon earlier to grow Chlorella .
Two basic kinds of systems are presently used consisting
either of (a) straight tubes arranged ﬂat on the ground or inlong vertical rows ( Pirt et al., 1983; Pirt, 1986; Torzillo et al.,
Figure 2 Schematic photobioreactor design, as follows a horizontal tubes.10 N. Abdel-Raouf et al.

Sciences (2012), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2012.04.0051986; Bocci et al.,1988; Chaumont et al., 1988 ), or (b) of tubes
spirally wound around a central support ( Robinson et al.,
1988; Borowitzka and Borowitzka, 1989b ) or a similar helical
structure ( Lee and Bazin, 1990 ).
The tubes can be of glass, Perspex or PVC, and diameters
range from about 24 cm to 24 mm. It is interesting to note that
most systems are now tending to use the narrower diametertubes, since these appear to have better hydrodynamic proper-
ties and result in improved productivity. Circulation of the al-
gal culture is by means of diaphragm, peristaltic, lobe orcentrifugal pumps or by an airlift. From an engineering point
of view, the circular reactors are easier to construct, and occu-
py less land area per unit volume.
These photobioreactors have been used on a pilot scale to
grow a wide variety of algae including Spirulina ,Porphyridi-
um,Chlorella ,Dunaliella ,Haematococcus ,Tetraselmis and
Phaeodactylum . These reactors also have the advantage of al-
most linear scale-up, unlike paddle wheel and similar ponds,
where scale-up presents major difﬁculties ( Borowitzka and
Borowitzka, 1989b ). Tubular reactors have several potential
problems which affect algal productivity. These are tempera-
ture control, control of O
2and CO 2, growth of the algae on
the inner surface of the tubes and adequate circulation speedswithout damage to the relatively fragile algal cells.
12.5. Stabilization ponds
Waste Stabilization Ponds (WSP) have proven to be effective
alternatives for treating wastewater, and the construction of
low energy-consuming ecosystems that use natural processes,in contrast to complex high-maintenance treatment systems,
will hopefully lead to more ecologically-sustainable wastewater
treatment in future. CWs also have the capability of meetingthe demand for a high percentage removal of pathogenic
organisms, compared to conventional technologies. CWs com-
bined, and joined with other technologies, may be importantfor even more improved performance of water cleaning sys-
tems. Many countries in tropical climates use WSPs for waste-
water treatment (e.g., Tanzania, Kenya, Malawi, Uganda,Zambia, Botswana, Zimbabwe). Many of these systems havebeen performing below the required standards, due to lack
of proper operation and maintenance ( Kayombo et al., 1999 ).
Waste Stabilization Ponds (WSPs) are large, shallow basins
in which raw sewage is treated entirely by natural processes
involving both algae and bacteria. They are used for sewage
treatment in temperate and tropical climates, and representone of the most cost-effective, reliable and easily-operated
methods for treating domestic and industrial wastewater. Waste
stabilization ponds are very effective in the removal of faecalcoliform bacteria. Sunlight energy is the only requirement forits operation. Further, it requires minimum supervision for dai-
ly operation, by simply cleaning the outlets and inlet works. The
temperature and duration of sunlight in tropical countries offeran excellent opportunity for high efﬁciency and satisfactory per-
formance for this type of water-cleaning system. Further, the
advantage of these systems, in terms of removal of pathogens,is one of the most important reasons for its use.
12.5.1. Types of waste stabilization ponds
WSP systems comprise a single string of anaerobic, facultative
and maturation ponds in series, or several such series in paral-
lel. In essence, anaerobic and facultative ponds are designedfor the removal of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), and
maturation ponds for pathogen removal, although some
BOD removal also occurs in maturation ponds and some path-ogen removal in anaerobic and facultative ponds ( Mara, 1987 ).
In most cases, only anaerobic and facultative ponds will be
needed for BOD removal when the efﬂuent is to be used for re-
stricted crop irrigation and ﬁsh pond fertilization, as well aswhen weak sewage is to be treated prior to its discharge to sur-
face waters. Maturation ponds are only required when the
efﬂuent is to be used for unrestricted irrigation, thereby havingto comply with the WHO guideline of >1000 faecal coliform
bacteria/100 ml. The WSP does not require mechanical mixing,
needing only sunlight to supply most of its oxygenation. Itsperformance may be measured in terms of its removal of
BOD and faecal coliform bacteria.
12.5.1.1. Anaerobic ponds. Anaerobic ponds are ( Fig. 3 ) com-
monly 2–5 m deep and receive wastewater with high organic
loads (i.e., usually greater than 100 g BOD/m
3day, equivalent
to more than 3000 kg/ha day for a depth of 3 m). They nor-mally do not contain dissolved oxygen or algae. In anaerobic
ponds, BOD removal is achieved by sedimentation of solids,
and subsequent anaerobic digestion in the resulting sludge.The process of anaerobic digestion is more intense at temper-
atures above 15 /C176C. The anaerobic bacteria are usually
sensitive to pH < 6.2. Thus, acidic wastewater must be neu-tralized prior to its treatment in anaerobic ponds. A prop-erly-designed anaerobic pond will achieve about a 40%
removal of BOD at 10 /C176C, and more than 60% at 20 /C176C. A
shorter retention time of 1.0–1.5 days is commonly used.

Sciences (2012), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2012.04.00512.5.1.2. Facultative ponds. Facultative ponds ( Fig. 4 ) (1–2 m
deep) are of two types: Primary facultative ponds that receiveraw wastewater, and secondary facultative ponds that receive
particle-free wastewater (usually from anaerobic ponds, septic
tanks, primary facultative ponds, and shallow sewerage sys-tems). The process of oxidation of organic matter by aerobicbacteria is usually dominant in primary facultative ponds or
secondary facultative ponds.
The processes in anaerobic and secondary facultative ponds
occur simultaneously in primary facultative ponds, as shown in
Fig. 2 .1. It is estimated that about 30% of the inﬂuent BOD
leaves the primary facultative pond in the form of methane(Marais 1970 ). A high proportion of the BOD that does not
leave the pond as methane ends up in algae. This process re-
quires more time, more land area, and possibly 2–3 weekswater retention time, rather than 2–3 days in the anaerobic
pond. In the secondary facultative pond (and the upper layers
of primary facultative ponds), sewage BOD is converted into‘‘Algal BOD,’’ and has implications for efﬂuent qualityrequirements. About 70–90% of the BOD of the ﬁnal efﬂuent
from a series of well-designed WSPs is related to the algae they
contain.
In secondary facultative ponds that receive particle-free
sewage (anaerobic efﬂuent), the remaining non-settleable
BOD is oxidised by heterotrophic bacteria ( Pseudomonas, Fla-
vobacterium, Archromobacter and Alcaligenes spp). The oxygen
required for oxidation of BOD is obtained from photosyn-
thetic activity of the micro-algae that grow naturally and pro-fusely in facultative ponds.
Facultative ponds are designed for BOD removal on the
basis of a relatively low surface loading (100–400 kg BOD/ha -
day), in order to allow for the development of a healthy algalpopulation, since the oxygen for BOD removal by the pond
bacteria is generated primarily via algal photosynthesis. The
facultative pond relies on naturally-growing algae. The facul-tative ponds are usually dark-green in colour because of the al-
gae they contain. Motile algae ( Chlamydomonas andEuglena )
tend to predominate the turbid water in facultative ponds,compared to none-motile algae ( Chlorella ).
The algal concentration in the pond depends on nutrient
loading, temperature and sunlight, but is usually in the rangeof 500–2000 lg chlorophyll- a/liter ( Mara, 1987 ). Because ofthe photosynthetic activities of pond algae, there is a diurnal
variation in the dissolved oxygen concentration. The dissolved
oxygen concentration in the water gradually rises after sunrise,in response to photosynthetic activity, to a maximum level inthe mid-afternoon, after which it falls to a minimum during
the night, when photosynthesis ceases and respiratory activities
consume oxygen. At peak algal activity, carbonate and bicar-bonate ions react to provide more carbon dioxide for the algae,
leaving an excess of hydroxyl ions. As a result, the pH of the
water can rise to above 9, which can kill faecal coliform. Goodwater mixing, which is usually facilitated by wind within the
upper water layer, ensures a uniform distribution of BOD, dis-
solved oxygen, bacteria and algae, thereby leading to a betterdegree of waste stabilization.
12.5.1.3. Maturation ponds. The maturation ponds, usually
1–1.5 m deep, receive the efﬂuent from the facultative ponds.Their primary function is to remove excreted pathogens.
Although maturation ponds achieve only a small degree of
BOD removal, their contribution to nutrient removal alsocan be signiﬁcant. Maturation ponds usually show less vertical
biological and physicochemical stratiﬁcation, and are well-
oxygenated throughout the day. The algal population in mat-uration ponds is much more diverse than that of the facultative
ponds, with non-motile genera tending to be more common.
The algal diversity generally increases from pond to pondalong the series ( Mara, 1989 ). Although faecal bacteria are
partially removed in the facultative ponds, the size and num-
bers of the maturation ponds especially determine the numbers
of faecal bacteria in the ﬁnal efﬂuent. There is some removal ofsolids-associated bacteria in anaerobic ponds, principally by
sedimentation. The principal mechanisms for faecal bacterial
removal in facultative and maturation ponds are now knownto be:
(a) Time and temperature;
(b) High pH (>9); and
(c) High light intensity, combined with high dissolved oxy-
gen concentration.
Time and temperature are the two principal parameters
used in designing maturation ponds. Faecal bacterial die-off
in ponds increases with both time and temperature ( Feachem
et al., 1983 ). High pH values (above 9) occur in ponds, due
to rapid photosynthesis by pond algae, which consumes CO
2
faster than can be replaced by bacterial respiration. As a result,
carbonate and bicarbonate ions dissociate, as follows:
2HCO Þ/C0
3!CO2/C0
3þH2OþCO 2
CO2/C0
3þH2O2!2OH/C0þCO 2
The resulting CO 2is ﬁxed by the algae, and the hydroxyl ions
accumulate, often raising the pH to values above 10. Faecalbacteria (with the notable exception of Vibrio cholerae) die
very quickly at pH values higher than 9 ( Pearson et al.,
1987a,b ). The role of high light intensity and high dissolved
oxygen concentration has recently been elucidated ( Curtis
et al., 1992 ). Light of wavelengths between 425 and 700 nm
can damage faecal bacteria by being absorbed by the humic
substances ubiquitous in wastewater. They remain in an ex-cited state sufﬁciently long to damage the cell. Light-mediated
die-off is completely dependent on the presence of oxygen, as
Figure 4 Facultative pond.12 N. Abdel-Raouf et al.

Sciences (2012), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2012.04.005well as being enhanced at high pH values. Thus, the sun plays a
threefold role in directly promoting faecal bacterial removal in
WSP, and in increasing the pond temperature, and more indi-
rectly by providing the energy for rapid algal photosynthesis.This not only raises the pond pH value above 9, but also re-
sults in high dissolved oxygen concentrations, which are neces-
sary for its third role; namely, promoting photo-oxidativedamage.
12.6. Algal mats
All the systems considered so far have used microalgae. An
alternative system for nutrient removal from wastewaters is
to use attached macroalgae or other aquatic plants. One suchsystem is the algal mat system developed by Adey (1982) , and
which is being used to remove nutrients from large tropical
aquarium systems such as those at Reef World and at theJames Cook University in Townsville. In this system, the algae
(a range of turf-forming species such as Enteromorpha ,Clado-
phora ,Sphacelaria ,Ectocarpus ,Ceramium ,Polysiphonia ,
Herposiphonia andOscillatoria ) are grown on a net or mesh
and the nutrient-rich water is passed over them. The algae con-
taining the nutrients are regularly removed by mechanically
removing them from the mats. Although this system has pro-ven very effective in controlling the nutrient levels in the
aquarium water so that even corals, which are very sensitive
to elevated nutrient levels, can grow, it does require a large sur-face area and is very labor intensive. In certain months of the
year the natural daylight also has to be supplemented with arti-
ﬁcial lighting to maintain an adequate rate of nutrientremoval.
Other aquatic plant based systems have been also proposed
for nutrient removal using aquatic plants such as water hya-
cinth, Typha and Phragmites , however all of these systems
have been shown to be less efﬁcient than algal systems
(Werblan et al., 1978; Wolverton, 1982; Finlayson and Chick,
1983 andFinlayson et al., 1987 ).13. Utilization of harvested algae biomass in biogas production
Waste-grown microalgae are a potentially important biomass
for biofuel production. However, most of the wastewater treat-
ment ponds systems do not use algae harvesting. Those that
do, typically return the biomass to the ponds, where it decom-poses on the pond ﬂoor, releasing methane to the atmosphereand degrading water quality ( Chaiprasert, 2011 ). Instead, the
algae biomass could be processed for lipid extraction to be
used in transportation fuel, or it can be anaerobically digestedto make biogas ( US, DOE, 2009; Brune et al., 2009 )(Fig. 5 ).
Waste-grown algae have widely varying lipid contents, and
the technologies for lipid extraction are still under develop-ment ( Woertz et al., 2009 ). Thus, anaerobic digestion is likely
to be the near-term, appropriate use of algae biomass at waste-
water treatment plants. However, algae typically yield lessmethane than wastewater sludge ( /C240.3 vs. 0.4 L CH4/g volatile
solids introduced). Ammonia toxicity and recalcitrant cell
walls are commonly cited causes of the lower yields. Ammoniatoxicity might be counteracted by co-digesting algae with high-carbon organic wastes. Carbon-rich feedstocks that are avail-
able near major wastewater pond systems include primary
and secondary municipal sludge, sorted municipal organic so-lid waste, waste fats–oils greases (FOGs), food industry waste,
waste paper, and various agricultural residues. Acclimation of
the digester microbial community to algae digestion may alsoimprove the yield.
Microalgae have two major advantages over higher plants
with respect to biofuels production. First, biomass productiv-ities are signiﬁcantly greater for microalgae, with productivi-ties projected at about 70 metric tons per hectare-year of
ash-free dry weight (i.e. organic matter) in specialized growth
reactors, such as high rate ponds ( Sheehan et al. 1998 ). This
productivity compares well with terrestrial temperate crops
(e.g., 3 MT/ha yr for soybeans, 9 MT/ha yr for corn, and
10–13 MT/ha yr for switchgrass or hybrid poplars ( Perlack
et al., 2005 ). Second, the cultivation of microalgae does not

Sciences (2012), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2012.04.005require arable land or fresh water – it can be carried out in
shallow ponds on hardpan soils, using saline or brackish
water. Relatively few studies have been published on theanaerobic digestion of microalgae (reviewed recently by Sialve
et al., 2009 ). The earliest work compared digestion of domestic
wastewater sludge and green microalgal biomass, Scenedesmus
and Chlorella , harvested from wastewater ponds ( Golueke
et al., 1957 ). They found that these algae could yield as much
as 0.25–0.50 L CH
4/g VS input at an 11-day retention time
when incubated at 35–50 /C176C. (Methane yield is typically ex-
pressed as liters of methane produced per gram of volatile sol-
ids introduced into a digester.) The lower value was 32% less
than the yield from the wastewater sludge. In addition, themaximum VS destruction was about 45% for the algae, com-
pared to 60% for the wastewater sludge. They suggested that
the relatively low digestability and thus yield of microalgal bio-mass was the result of cell walls resisting bacterial degradation,but being more readily digested by bacteria at the higher tem-
perature. Methane yield and productivity were doubled when
equal masses of wastewater sludge and Spirulina biomass were
co-digested ( Samson and LeDuy 1983 ). Similarly, Yen (2004)
andYen and Brune (2007) added waste paper (50% w/w) to
aquacultural microalgal sludge to adjust the C:N ratio toaround 20–25:1 which, in turn, doubled the methane produc-
tion rate from 0.6 L/L day to 1.2 L/L day at 35 /C176C and with
a hydraulic retention time of 10 days.
14. Conclusion
* Algae can be used in wastewater treatment for a range of
purposes, including;
1. reduction of BOD,2. removal of N and/or P,
3. inhibition of coliforms,
4. removal of heavy metals
* The high concentration of N and P in most wastewaters
also means these wastewaters may possibly be used as cheap
nutrient sources for algal biomass production. This algalbiomass could be used for:
1. methane production,
2. composting,3. production of liquid fuels ((pseudo-vegetable fuels),
4. as animal feed or in aquaculture and
5. production of ﬁne chemicals.
