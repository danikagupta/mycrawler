Introduction
L-tryptophan (tryptophan; Trp) is a large neutral amino acid essential to human metabolism because it is the 
metabolic precursor of serotonin (a neurotransmitter), melatonin (a neurohormone), and niacin (vitamin B3).
As a component of dietary protein, tryptophan is particularly plentiful in chocolate, oats, bananas, dried 
dates, milk, cottage cheese, meat, fish, turkey, and peanuts. Approximately 300 mg Trp is available in three ounces 
of turkey, lamb, beef, tuna, or peanuts.1 Relative to other amino acids, small amounts are needed to have a thera -
peutic effect, which is fortunate because Trp is the least abundant amino acid in the diet.2
In 1989, the importation of L-tryptophan was banned in the United States after cases of a deadly autoim -
mune illness called eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome were traced to an improperly-prepared batch of tryptophan.3 
Although the tryptophan was isolated to a single Japanese factory that allowed a toxic bacterial metabolite through 
the purification process, the ban was maintained and Trp availability was limited to the prescription drug (Tryptan), 
infant formulas, and enteral feeding products. Since 1994 tryptophan has been available and marketed as a dietary 
supplement in the United States, while imported product remains limited by special regulations.
Pharmacokinetics
The most investigated aspect of tryptophan metabolism is the serotonin pathway that includes the sub -
sequent creation of melatonin. Tryptophan hydroxylase is the rate-limiting enzyme for serotonin production and 
involves the conversion of Trp to 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP). This enzyme can be inhibited by stress, insulin 
resistance, magnesium or vitamin B6 deficiency, or increasing age.4 The decarboxylation of 5-HTP to serotonin is 
dependent on the presence of the active form of vitamin B6, pyridoxal 5’-phosphate, while the further conversion 
to melatonin necessitates S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe).5-Hydro xytryptophanL-Tryptophan

Alternative Medicine Review u Volume 11, Number 1  u 2006  Page 53Tryptophan and 5-HTP penetrate the blood-
brain barrier, although tryptophan requires active 
transport and competes for the same receptors with 
other neutral amino acids – tyrosine, phenylalanine, 
valine, leucine, and isoleucine.5,6 In fact, the best pre -
dictor of a given meal’s effect on brain tryptophan 
and serotonin levels is the serum ratio of Trp to the 
pool of large neutral amino acids.7 More clinically 
relevant, however, serotonin levels are enhanced by 
carbohydrate ingestion as insulin release accelerates 
the serum removal of competing valine, leucine, and 
isoleucine. Similarly, a higher percentage of protein 
in the diet slows serotonin elevation.5,8
Although tryptophan can be found free in the 
serum, most is bound to albumin. Nonesterified fatty 
acids out-compete Trp for albumin’s common bind -
ing site,9 while displacement from albumin is also 
associated with the release of free fatty acids during 
exercise.10
The urinary metabolites of tryptophan in -
clude 3-hydroxykynurenine, xanthurenic acid, and 
kynurenine. Serum kynurenine, however, is metabo -
lized into niacin (vitamin B3). This conversion is in -
efficient since 60 mg of tryptophan are required to 
synthesize 1 mg of niacin, which also depletes stores 
of the vitamin cofactors B1, B2, and B6.11,12
Mechanism of Action
Tryptophan’s primary mechanism of action is 
its role as the metabolic precursor of the neurotrans -
mitter serotonin. Other neurotransmitters and central 
nervous system (CNS) chemicals, such as melatonin, 
dopamine, norepinephrine, and beta-endorphin, have 
also been shown to increase following oral adminis -
tration of tryptophan.13-16
There is limited data linking tryptophan’s 
modulation of the endocrine system. Tryptophan’s 
effects on cortisol levels have been inconsistent.17,18 
Although intravenous tryptophan stimulates secre -
tion of prolactin and growth hormone,19,20 such an as -
sociation has not been tested with oral dosing.
Clinical Indications
Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) 
A dose of 6 g tryptophan has been found to 
significantly (p=0.004) decrease mood swings, ten -
sion, and irritability in women with premenstrual dysphoria. Three consecutive cycles, from ovulation 
to the third day of menstruation, were assessed using 
the Visual Analog Mood Scales.21 Tryptophan’s role 
in PMS may be attributed to the increased activation 
of tryptophan catabolism to kynurenine during the lu -
teal phase of the menstrual cycle.22
Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) 
In the case of SAD, tryptophan has shown 
benefit in non-responders to light therapy. Four weeks 
of treatment with Trp (2 g twice daily, increased to 2 
g three times daily if initially no response) was com -
pared to light therapy (10,000 lux x 30 min daily in the 
morning). At the end of seven weeks, similar signifi -
cant responses were noted in both groups (p=0.014 in 
Trp group). However, when light therapy was discon -
tinued patients quickly relapsed; whereas, patients on 
tryptophan had a slower relapse rate.23 Similar results 
were demonstrated in 13 SAD patients treated with 
light therapy or tryptophan.24
Sleep Disorders
Tryptophan has been researched for sleep 
disorders for 30 years. Improvement of sleep latency 
has been noted,25,26 even at doses as low as 1 g;27 in-
creased stage IV sleep has been noted at even lower 
doses – 250 mg tryptophan.27 Significant improve -
ment in obstructive sleep apnea, but not central sleep 
apnea, has been noted at doses of 2.5 g at bedtime, 
with those experiencing the most severe apnea dem -
onstrating the best response.28
While many sedative medications have opi -
oid-like effects, L-tryptophan administration does not 
limit cognitive performance or inhibit arousal from 
sleep.25,29
Depression and Other Mental Disorders
The tryptophan metabolite, 5-HTP, has shown 
significant clinical response for depression in 2-4 weeks, 
at doses of 50-300 mg three times daily.30-36 Although 
reduced levels of serum Trp have been linked to some 
forms of depression, depression was not relieved 
with intravenous tryptophan.37 Numerous studies, 
 however, have found tryptophan depletion produced 
depressive relapse and even initiation of depressive 
symptoms in healthy subjects.38-42 Copyright © 2006 Thorne Research, Inc.  All Rights Reserved.  No Reprint Without Written Permission. Alternative Medicine Review Volume 11, Number 1  March 2006L-Tryptophan   Monograph
Page 54   Alternative Medicine Review u Volume 11, Number 1  u 2006Tryptophan depletion has also been shown 
to promote relapse of bulimia43 and schizophrenia,44 
indicating the pivotal requirements for tryptophan in 
mental disorders other than depression.
Tryptophan supplementation should be 
avoided in depression with reversed diurnal variation 
(worse in the evening), which commonly presents 
with an elevated ratio of tryptophan to large neutral 
amino acids and poor response to serotonergic anti -
depressants.45
Smoking
Tryptophan (50 mg/kg/day) has been used as 
an adjunct therapy for smoking cessation. During a 
two-week study, tryptophan-treated subjects experi -
enced fewer nicotine withdrawal symptoms and were 
able to abstain or smoke fewer cigarettes than con -
trols.46
Diagnosis of a Vitamin B6 Deficiency 
The Tryptophan Load Test is a lab evalu -
ation of vitamin B6 status. Elevated urinary xanth -
urenic acid (>50 mg/24 hr) after 2 g Trp is commonly 
viewed as a sign of a deficiency of vitamin B6,47 al-
though it can be falsely elevated in pregnancy48 and 
in women using oral contraceptives.49 Xanthurenic 
acid elevation has also been associated with cataract 
formation.50
Drug-Nutrient Interactions
Case reports of serotonin syndrome have 
noted a connection between tryptophan used con -
comitantly with monoamine oxidase inhibitors.51,52 
This syndrome is characterized by agitation, confu -
sion, delirium, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and blood 
pressure fluctuations. Although no reports have been 
published, it is possible that tryptophan, when taken 
in combination with a selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitor (SSRI) such as Prozac®, Paxil®, or Zoloft®, 
may also precipitate serotonin syndrome.
Side Effects and Toxicity
Potential side effects at high doses (100 mg/
kg/day, i.e., 7 g/150 lbs) include gastric irritation, 
vomiting, and head twitching.1Warnings and Contraindications
Patients with liver cirrhosis should avoid 
tryptophan supplementation. Cirrhotics present with 
reduced activity of tryptophan pyrrolase (22%), with 
subsequent increased free tryptophan and half-life, 
with decreased clearance.53
The effects of supplemental tryptophan dur -
ing pregnancy are scarce. One study monitored fetal 
breathing activity via ultrasound over a 3.5-hour pe -
riod and noted alteration in fetal breathing activity af -
ter maternal Trp loading (1 g) was less than observed 
after glucose load (100 g).54 This, however, was a low 
dose of tryptophan. Further safety studies are war -
ranted before use during pregnancy can be recom -
mended.
Dosage
Evening oral doses of tryptophan as low as 
250 mg have been shown to improve sleep quality, 
although the typical dosage range for sleep disorders 
and depression is 1-3 g daily. Safe and effective dos -
ages for other disorders range from 0.5-4 g daily, 
while potentially higher doses (50 mg/kg/day) have 
been used short term as a smoking cessation interven -
tion.
