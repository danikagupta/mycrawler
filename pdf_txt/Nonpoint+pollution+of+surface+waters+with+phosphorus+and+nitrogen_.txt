Nonpoint Pollution of
Surface Waters with
Phosphorus and Nitrogen
SUMMARY
Runoff from our farms and cities is a major source of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) entering rivers, lakes, and coastal
waters.  Acid rain and airborne pollutants generated by human activities also supply N to surface waters.  These nutrientsources are called nonpoint because they involve widely dispersed activities.  Nonpoint inputs are difficult to measure and
regulate because of their dispersed origins and because they vary with the seasons and the weather.  Yet nonpoint inputs are the
major source of water pollution in the United States today, and their impacts are profound. In aquatic ecosystems, over-
enrichment with P and N causes a wide range of problems, including toxic algal blooms, loss of oxygen, fish kills, loss ofseagrass beds and other aquatic vegetation, degradation of coral reefs, and loss of biodiversity  including speciesimportant to commercial and sport fisheries and shellfish industries.  Thus, nutrient fouling seriously degrades our marineand freshwater resources and impairs their use for industry, agriculture, recreation, drinking water, and other purposes.
Based on our review of the scientific literature, we are certain that:
•Eutrophication caused by over-enrichment with P and N is a widespread problem in rivers, lakes, estuaries, and
coastal oceans.
•Nonpoint pollution is a major source of P and N to surface waters of the United States.  The major sources of
nonpoint pollution are agriculture and urban activity, including industry and transportation.
•In the U.S. and many other nations, inputs of P and N to agriculture in the form of fertilizers exceed outputs of
those nutrients in the form of crops.
•High densities of livestock have created situations in which manure production exceeds the needs of crops to which the
manure is applied. The density of animals on the land is directly related to nutrient flows to aquatic ecosystems.
•Excess fertilization and manure production cause a P surplus, which accumulates in soil.  Some of this surplus is
transported in soil runoff to aquatic ecosystems.
•Excess fertilization and manure production create a N surplus on agricultural lands.  Surplus N is mobile in many soils, and
much leaches into surface waters or percolates into groundwater.  Surplus N can also volatilize to the atmosphere and beredeposited far downwind as acid rain or dry pollutants that may eventually reach distant aquatic ecosystems.
If current practices continue, nonpoint pollution of surface waters is virtually certain to increase in the future.  Such an
outcome is not inevitable, however, because a number of technologies, land use practices, and conservation measures are
available that can decrease the flow of nonpoint P and N into surface waters.
From our review of the available scientific information, we are confident that:
•Nonpoint pollution of surface waters with P and N could be decreased by reducing excess nutrient flows in
agricultural systems, reducing farm and urban runoff, and reducing N emissions from fossil fuel burning.
•Eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems can be reversed by decreasing input rates of P and N.  However, rates of
recovery are highly variable, and recovery is often slow.
The panel finds that the roots of the problem of nonpoint pollution and eutrophication are well understood scientifically.
There is a critical need for creative efforts to translate this understanding into effective policies and practices that will leadto protection and recovery of our aquatic resources. Issues in Ecology           Number 3              Summer 1998

INTRODUCTION
From ancient times, people have chosen to live
near water, settling in river valleys, beside lakes, or along
coastlines. The attractions of water are as diverse as hu-
man needs and aspirations.  Clean water is a crucial re-source for drinking, irrigation, industry, transportation,recreation, fishing, hunting, support of biodiversity, andsheer esthetic enjoyment.  For as long as humans have
lived near waterways, they have also used them to wash
away and dilute societys wastes and pollutants.  But withgrowing populations and increased production and con-sumption, this long tradition of flushing wastes down-stream has begun to overwhelm the cleansing capacities
of the Earths waters.  Pollutant inputs have increased in
recent decades, and the result has been degradation ofwater quality in many rivers, lakes and coastal oceans.This degradation shows up in the disruption of naturalaquatic ecosystems, and the consequent loss of their
component species as well as the amenities that theseecosystems once provided to society.  Water shortages,for instance, are increasingly common and likely to be-
come more severe in the future.  Water shortages and
poor water quality are linked, because contamination re-duces the supply of water and increases the costs of treat-ing water to make it safe for human use.  Thus, prevent-ing pollution is among the most cost-effective means of
increasing water supplies.
The most common impairment of surface waters
in the U.S. is eutrophication caused by excessive inputsof phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N).  Impaired waters aredefined as those that are not suitable for designated uses
such as drinking, irrigation, industry, recreation, or fish-
ing.  Eutrophication accounts for about half of the im-paired lake area and 60% of the impaired river reaches inthe U.S. and is also the most widespread pollution prob-

lem of U.S. estuaries.  Other important causes of sur-
face water degradation are siltation caused by ero-sion from agricultural, logging, and construction ac-tivities (silt also carries nutrients, contributing toeutrophication); acidification from atmospheric sources and
mine drainage; contamination by toxins; introduction of ex-
otic species such as zebra mussels and sea lampreys; andhydrologic changes created by dams, channelization, drain-ing of wetlands, and other waterworks.
Chemical inputs to rivers, lakes, and oceans origi-
nate either from point or nonpoint sources.  Point sources
include effluent pipes from municipal sewage treatmentplants and factories.  Pollutant discharges from suchsources tend to be continuous, with little variability overtime, and often they can be monitored by measuring dis-
charge and chemical concentrations periodically at a single
place.  Consequently, point sources are relatively simpleto monitor and regulate, and can often be controlled bytreatment at the source.  Nonpoint inputs can also becontinuous, but are more often intermittent and linked
to seasonal agricultural activity such as planting and plow-
ing or irregular events such as heavy rains or major con-struction.  Nonpoint inputs often arise from a varied suiteof activities across extensive stretches of the landscape,and materials enter receiving waters as overland flow,
underground seepage, or through the atmosphere.  Con-
sequently, nonpoint sources are difficult to measure andregulate.  Control of nonpoint pollution centers on landmanagement practices and regulation of the release ofpollutants to the atmosphere.  Such controls may affect
the daily activities of millions of people.In many cases over recent decades, point sources
of water pollution have been reduced, owing to their relativeease of identification and control.  However, point sources
are still substantial in some parts of the world and may in-
crease with future expansion of urban areas, aquaculture,
and factory farms, such as hog factories.  This reportfocuses on nonpoint sources, not because point sourcesare unimportant, but because nonpoint inputs are oftenoverlooked and pose a significant environmental challenge.
Nonpoint inputs are the major source of water pol-
lution in the U.S. today .  The National Water Quality Inven-tory stated in 1988 that the more we look, the more wefind.  For example, 72% to 82% of eutrophic lakes wouldrequire control of nonpoint P inputs to meet water quality
standards, even if point inputs were reduced to zero.
This report primarily addresses nonpoint pollution
of water by P and N because:•Eutrophication is currently the most widespread water
quality problem in the U.S. and many other nations.
•Restoration of most eutrophic waters requires the
reduction of nonpoint inputs of P and N.
•A sound scientific understanding of the causes of
nonpoint nutrient pollution exists.  In many cases, wehave the technical knowledge needed to decrease
nonpoint pollution to levels compatible with water
quality standards.
•The most important barriers to control of nonpoint
nutrient pollution appear to be social, political, andinstitutional.  We hope that our summary of the sci-
entific basis of the problem will inform and support
debate about solutions.Figure 2 - Sources of point and nonpoint chemical inputs to lakes, rivers, and oceans recognized by statutes.
Pollutant discharges from point sources tend to be continous and therefore relatively simple to identify and monitor.
Nonpoint sources, however, arise from a suite of activities across large areas and are much more difficult to control.POINT SOURCES

4WHY IS NONPOINT P AND N
POLLUTION A CONCERN?
Eutrophication: Scope and Causes
Eutrophication means the fertilization of sur-
face waters by nutrients that were previously scarce.
Over geologic time, eutrophication through nutrient
and sediment inflow is a natural aging process by whichwarm shallow lakes evolve to dry land.  Today humanactivities are greatly accelerating the process.  Fresh-water eutrophication has been a growing problem for
decades.  Both P and N
supplies contribute to it,although for many lakesexcessive P inputs arethe primary cause.
Eutrophication is
also widespread and rap-idly expanding in estuar-ies and coastal seas ofthe developed world.  For
most temperate estuar-
ies and coastal ecosys-tems, N is the elementmost limiting to produc-tion of plant material
such as algae (primary
productivity), and so Ninputs are the most prob-lematic.  Although N isthe major factor in
eutrophication of most
estuaries and coastalseas, P is also an essen-tial element that contrib-utes to coastal eutrophi-
cation.  It is, in fact, the
dominant control on pri-mary production in somecoastal ecosystems.
Consequences
Eutrophication has many negative effects on
aquatic ecosystems.  Perhaps the most visible conse-quence is the proliferation of algae, which can turnwater a turbid green and coat shallower surfaces with
pond scum. This increased growth of algae and also
aquatic weeds can degrade water quality and  inter-fere with use of the water for fisheries, recreation,industry, agriculture, and drinking.  As overabundant
nuisance plants die, bacterial decomposers proliferate;
as they work to break down this plant matter, the bac-teria consume more dissolved oxygen from the water.The result can be oxygen shortages that cause fishkills.  Eutrophication can lead to loss of habitats such
as aquatic plant beds in fresh and marine waters and
coral reefs along tropical coasts.  Thus, eutrophica-tion plays a role in the loss of aquatic biodiversity.
Explosive growths of nuisance algae are among
the most pernicious effects of eutrophication.  These al-
gae produce structures or
chemicals that are harm-ful to other organisms, in-cluding livestock or hu-mans.  In marine ecosys-
tems, algal blooms known
as red or brown tidescause widespread prob-lems by releasing toxinsand by spurring oxygen
depletion as they die and
decompose.  The inci-dence of harmful algalblooms in coastal oceanshas increased in recent
years. This increase is
linked to coastal eutrophi-cation and other factors,such as changes in marinefood webs that may in-
crease decomposition and
nutrient recycling or re-duce populations of algae-grazing fish.  Algal bloomshave severe negative im-
pacts on aquaculture and
shellfisheries.  They causeshellfish poisoning in hu-mans, and have causedsignificant mortality in
marine mammals.  A toxic
dinoflagellate known as Pfiesteria has been associatedwith mortality of finfish on the U.S. Atlantic coast. Thehighly toxic, volatile chemical produced by this dinoflagel-late can also cause neurological damage to people who
come in contact with it.
In freshwater, blooms of cyanobacteria (formerly
called blue-green algae) are a prominent symptom of
Figure 3 -  Over extended periods of time, lakes tend to fill with
sediment through natural processes (left).  Currently, changes inland use and nutrient inputs are accelerating this process, fillinglakes with sediments and algal blooms in just a few years (right).

remain the primary source of N inputs.  And although
nonpoint inputs of P are often significant, point sources
supply the highest inputs of P in many marine environ-
ments.
Remediation
Reversal of eutrophication requires the reduction
of P and N inputs, but recovery can sometimes be accel-
erated by combining input controls with other manage-ment methods.  In fact, active human intervention maybe necessary in some cases because the eutrophic stateis relatively stable in lakes.  Some internal mechanisms
that may hamper recovery from this degraded state in-
clude continuing release of P from accumulations in lake-bottom sediments, loss of submerged plants whose rootsserved to stabilize sediments, and complex changes inthe food web such as decreases in grazing fish or zoop-
lankton that helped to control growth of nuisance algae.
Less is known about the stability of eutrophication in es-tuaries and coastal oceans, but the eutrophic state maybe more easily disrupted and remedied there because inopen, well-mixed coastal oceans nutrients may be diluted
and flushed away rapidly.  However, in relatively confined,
shallow marine waters such as the Baltic Sea, nutrientsmay be trapped and eutrophication may be as persistentas it is in lakes.
Direct Health Effects
Phosphorus in water is not considered directly
toxic to humans and animals, and because of this, noeutrophication.  These blooms contribute to a wide range
of water-related problems including summer fish kills, foul
odors, and unpalatable tastes in drinking water.  Further-
more, when such water is processed in water treatmentplants, the high load of organic detritus reacts with chlo-rine to form carcinogens known as trihalomethanes.  Wa-ter-soluble compounds toxic to the nervous system and
liver are released when cyanobacterial blooms die or are
ingested. These can kill livestock and may pose a serioushealth hazard to humans.
Contribution of Nonpoint Pollution
Nonpoint sources are now the dominant inputs
of P and N to most U.S. surface waters.  Nonpoint in-puts of P cause eutrophication across a large area oflakes and reservoirs in the U.S.  Nonpoint sources are
also the dominant contributors of P and N to most
rivers in the U.S., although point sources still generate
more than half of the P and N flowing into rivers fromurbanized areas.  In one study of 86 rivers, nonpointN sources were responsible for more than 90% of Ninputs to more than half these rivers.  Nonpoint P
sources contributed over 90% of the P in a third of
these rivers.
For many estuaries and coastal seas, nonpoint
sources are the dominant N inputs.  Along the entire
coastline of the North Atlantic Ocean, for instance,
nonpoint sources of N are some 9-fold greater than
inputs from wastewater treatment plants.  In somecoastal areas, however, wastewater treatment plantsFigure 4 - Eutrophication, caused by excessive inputs of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N), has

6drinking water standards have been established for P .
Any toxicity caused by P pollution in fresh waters isindirect, through stimulation of toxic algal blooms orresulting oxygen depletion.
In contrast, nitrate pollution poses a direct
health threat to humans and other mammals.  Ni-trate in water is toxic at high concentrations andhas been linked to toxic effects on livestock andalso to blue baby disease (methemoglobinemia)
in infants. The Environmental Protection Agency has
established a Maximum Contaminant Level for ni-trate-N in drinking water of 10 milligrams per literto protect babies under 3 to 6 months of age. This
age group is most sensitive because bacteria thatlive in an infants digestive tract can reduce nitrateto nitrite, which oxidizes hemoglobin and interferes
with the oxygen-carrying ability of blood.  In cattle,
nitrate  reduced to nitrite can also be toxic andcauses a similar type of anemia as well as abortions.Levels of 40-100 milligrams of nitrate-N per literin livestock drinking water are considered risky un-
less the animals feed is low in nitrates and forti-
fied with vitamin A.

WHAT ARE THE SOURCES OF
NONPOINT POLLUTION?
Nonpoint P and N pollution is caused primarily by
agricultural and urban activities.  In the U.S., agricultureis the predominant source of nonpoint pollution. Wind or
rain-borne deposits from a variety of sources, including
agriculture and fossil fuel burning, can add significantamounts of N to surface waters.
Agriculture
On the worlds croplands, human additions and
removals of nutrients have overwhelmed natural nutrientcycles.  Globally, more nutrients are added as fertilizersthan are removed as produce.  Fertilizers are moved fromareas of manufacture to
areas of crop produc-
tion.  The nutrients in thefertilizer are only partlyincorporated into crops,which are then har-
vested and transported
to other areas for con-sumption by people orlivestock.  Thus on bal-ance, there is a net
transport of P and N
from sites of fertilizermanufacture to sites offertilizer deposition andmanure production.  This
flux creates a nutrient
surplus on croplands,and this surplus is the un-derlying cause ofnonpoint pollution from agriculture.
Fertilizer
Phosphorus is accumulating in the worlds agricul-
tural soils.  Between 1950 and 1995, about 600 millionmetric tons of fertilizer P were applied to Earths surface,
primarily on croplands.  During the same time period, roughly
250 million metric tons of P were removed from croplandsin the form of harvested crops.  Some of this produce wasfed to livestock and a portion of the manure from theseanimals was reapplied to croplands, returning some of the
harvested P (about 50 million metric tons) to the soil.  Thus
the net addition of P to cropland soils over this period wasabout 400 million metric tons.  This excess P may eitherremain in soils or be exported to surface waters by erosion
or leaching.  The majority of applied P remains on croplands,
with only 3 to 20% leaving by export to surface waters.  Itis likely, therefore, that about 350 million metric tons of Phas accumulated in the worlds croplands.  The standing stockof P in the upper 10 centimeters of soil in the worlds crop-
lands is roughly 1,300 million metric tons.  That means that
a net addition of 350 million metric tons between 1950and 1995 would have increased the P content of agricul-tural soils by about 25%.  In the U.S. and Europe, only about30% of the P input in fertilizers ends up being incorporated
into crop plants, resulting in an average accumulation rate of
22 kilograms of surplus P per hectare each year.  Acrosswhole watersheds, the amount of P applied to agriculturalsoils in excess of what plants can use is closely linked to
eutrophication of surface
waters.
Global industrial
production of N fertilizershas increased steeply fromnearly zero in the 1940s
to roughly 80 million met-
ric tons per year.  In theU.S. and Europe, only
18% of the N input infertilizer leaves farms in
produce, meaning that
on average, 174 kilo-grams per hectare of sur-plus N is left behind oncroplands each year. This
surplus may accumulate
in soils, erode or leach tosurface and ground wa-ters, or enter the atmo-
sphere.  N is added to the atmosphere through volatiliza-
tion of ammonia and microbial generation of nitrous ox-
ide gas from soils.  Nitrous oxide contributes to global warm-
ing and can also catalyze the destruction of stratosphericozone.  Much of the N volatilized to the atmosphere in
these forms is rained out or redeposited in dry forms on
land or water and eventually enters rivers, lakes, and other
aquatic ecosystems.
Manure
Intensive animal production generally involves
feeding large numbers of animals in small areas.  For
example, 4% of the cattle feedlots in the U. S. produce84% of the cattle.  Such large concentrations of animals
Figure 8 - Intensive animal production, where large numbers of ani-
mals are concentrated in small feedlots, creates enormous amounts
of waste, causing excess nutrients to build up in the soil, run off, or
infiltrate water supplies.

8create enormous amounts of waste.  The disposal prob-
lems are comparable to those for raw human sewage,and yet the regulatory standards for disposing of animalwastes are generally far less stringent than the standardscities and towns must meet for treating human sewage.
Nutrients in manure can be recycled by applying
the manure to cropland.  However, the amount of ma-nure generated by concentrated livestock operations of-ten far exceeds the capacity of nearby croplands to useand retain the nutrients.  At typical stocking rates for feed-
lots, for instance, an area of cropland roughly 1,000 times
greater than the feedlot area itself is required to distributemanure nutrients at levels equal to what the crops on thatland can use. This much accessible cropland may not be
available, so excess quantities of manure are applied to
smaller land areas. The excess nutrients then build up in
soil, run off, or infiltrate to water supplies. Or, in the caseof N, they may enter the atmosphere.
Transport to Aquatic Ecosystems
Increased fluxes of P and N to surface waters
have been measured after application of fertilizer or ma-nure to farm land.  Fertilizer P and N losses in runoff aregenerally less than 5% of the amount applied.  Lossesfrom manure can be slightly higher (up to 20% if rain falls
immediately after application).  However, these percent-
ages underestimate total N flux to aquatic ecosystemsbecause they do not include infiltration and leaching whichultimately carry N to ground and surface waters.  N ex-port from agricultural ecosystems to water, as a percent-
age of fertilizer inputs, ranges from 10% to 40% for
loam and clay soils to 25% to 80% for sandy soils.  Ingeneral, the rates of nutrient loss to water from fertilizerand manure are influenced by the rate, season, chemical
form, and method of nutrient application; amount andtiming of rainfall after application; and the plant cover.The greater proportional losses of P and N from manurethan from industrially produced fertilizers may result from
higher P and N concentrations in manure and less flexibil-
ity in the timing of applications, since manure must beworked into soils before or after the growing seasonrather than at the time growing crops require P and N.
The amount of P lost to surface waters increases
with the P content of the soil.  The loss can come in the form
of dissolved P , but even more P is transported as particles.
In the long term, this particulate P can be converted tophosphate and made available to aquatic organisms.
N transport to the oceans has increased in recent de-
cades and the increase can be correlated to a number of human
activities that increase N inputs into watersheds.  Similarly, theamount of P carried in rivers to the oceans is positively corre-lated with human population density in watersheds.  Globally, themovement of P to coastal oceans has increased from an esti-
mated pristine flux rate of 8 million metric tons per year to the
current rate of 22 million metric tons per year.  About 30% ofthis increase is attributed to P enrichment of agricultural soils,and the remainder to increasing rates of erosion.
Urban Runoff
A significant amount of P and N enters lakes, riv-
ers, and coastal waters from urban nonpoint sources suchas construction sites, runoff of lawn fertilizers and petwastes, septic systems and developed areas that lack sew-
ers.  Urban runoff is the third most important cause of
lake deterioration in the U. S., affecting about 28% ofthe lake area that does not meet water quality standards.
Figure 9 - Runoff from urban activities,
such as lawn fertilizers and pet wastes,is a significant source of nonpoint pol-lution that we can all help to control.

Urban point sources of water pollution, such as sewage
and industrial discharges, are also significant, but unlike
nonpoint sources, they are often managed intensively.
Construction sites are a critical concern as sources
of nonpoint pollution.  Although construction sites may oc-cupy a relatively small percentage of the land area, their
erosion rates can be extremely high and the total nonpoint
pollution yield quite large.  Erosion rates from watersheds
under development approach 50,000 metric tons per square
kilometer a year, compared to 1,000 to 4,000 metrictons per square kilometer for agricultural lands and less
than 100 metric tons for lands with undisturbed plant cover.
Eroded material from construction sites contributes tosiltation of water bodies as well as eutrophication.
Atmospheric Deposition of N
N deposited to surface waters from the atmo-
sphere arises from several sources, including trace gasesreleased from farm soils and the burning of fossil fuels.Combustion of fuels such as coal and oil releases signifi-cant quantities of nitrogen-based trace gases into the at-
mosphere, both by oxidizing organic N stored in the fuels
themselves and by directly fixing molecular N from theair during high temperature, high pressure combustion.(Fixing N involves pulling it from the air and bonding it tohydrogen or oxygen to form compounds that plants and
other organisms can use.) Currently, some 20 million met-
ric tons of fixed N per year are released globally fromfossil fuel combustion by automobiles, factories, and powerplants. However, this represents only one-fourth of theamount of N used in inorganic N fertilizer and perhaps
one-seventh of the total amount of N fixed globally
through human activity, including the manufacture of in-organic fertilizers and the planting of N-fixing crops such
as soybeans and other legumes. Nonetheless, N from fossil
fuel combustion may contribute substantially to thenonpoint-source pollution of surface waters.
A comparative study of N fluxes from 33 rivers in
the northeastern U.S. found that the amounts of both nitrate
and total N in the rivers were correlated with the atmospheric
deposition of oxidized N  which comes largely from fossilfuel combustion  onto the watersheds of these rivers.  Fora small subset of these rivers, historical data showed an in-crease in nitrate concentrations from the early 1900s to
the present.  The increase in nitrate concentrations corre-
lates with estimates for increased fossil fuel emissions of Nduring the same period.
We still have much to learn about the transport
of atmospherically-derived N from land to water.  Clearly
the atmosphere can be a significant source of N to lakes
and rivers and make potentially large contributions tocoastal eutrophication.  And we know that volatilizationof nitrogen-based gases from agricultural land supplies asignificant fraction of this N.
WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT IT?
Unless current practices are changed, nonpoint
pollution of surface waters will increase in the future.
Some factors that drive this expectation are the substan-
tial and growing buildup of P and N in agricultural soils;an increasing human population; peoples preference formeat-rich diets, which mandates increasing livestock pro-duction; growth of urban areas with associated develop-
ment and erosion; and increased fixation of N by human
activities such as fertilizer production and fossil fuel burn-

struction sites is a major source of run-off from developing areas.  Eroded ma-terials contribute to siltation and eutrophi-cation of lakes, rivers, and coastal
oceans.

10ing.  (Ironically, the increasing use of more efficient en-
gines and turbines for burning fossil fuels has had the
inadvertent effect of increasing the fixation of N.)
However, this pessimistic forecast could prove to
be incorrect, because there are a number of ways that nonpointpollution can be reduced.  Here we offer a brief catalog.
Landscape Management
Forests and other vegetation along riverbanks and
shorelines can significantly re-duce the flow of nonpoint nutri-ents into surface waters.  This
vegetation also makes important
contributions to fish and wildlifehabitat and regional biodiversity.Interest in the use of riparian veg-etation for controlling nonpoint
pollution has grown rapidly in re-
cent years, and the number ofscientific studies and articles onthe subject has burgeoned.
Wetlands, lakes, and riv-
ers are sites of denitrification 
a bacterial process that breaksdown organic N and releases itto the atmosphere, decreasingthe flow of N to downstream
ecosystems.  Restoration of wet-
lands and floodplains is likely toincrease denitrification at a land-scape scale and to some extentreduce N pollution of lakes and
rivers.  Thus, wetland restoration
may be the most cost-effectivemethod of decreasing nonpointN pollution.
Agricultural P and N
Management
The ultimate causes of nonpoint pollution from agri-
cultural lands are excessive fertilizer use and developmentof high-density livestock operations.  There are direct solu-
tions.  Fertilizer applications can be reduced to match crop
needs.  Wastes from high-density livestock operations canbe managed as a point source of pollution just like humanwastes.  Nutrients in manure can be used as fertilizer, ornutrients can be removed (as in human sewage treatment)
before wastes are discharged to surface waters.  Work to
implement these solutions now focuses on establishing thethreshold levels at which soil nutrients threaten water qual-
ity, identifying intensive sources of pollutants, and develop-
ing mechanisms for controlling both nutrient sources andtransport.
Thresholds
Threshold levels of soil nutrients that create un-
acceptable threats to water quality must be established inorder to provide a firm basis for regulations that protect
aquatic resources.  Definingthresholds has been controver-
sial, in part because data are in-
sufficient.  Unfortunately, thedata base relating soil nutrientconcentrations to runoff is lim-ited to a few types of soils and
crops, making it difficult to ex-
trapolate these data to all re-gions.  Because costs of nutri-
ent management are signifi-cant, the agricultural industries
most likely to be affected by
thresholds have vigorouslychallenged their scientific ba-sis.  A stronger scientific foun-dation can and should be de-
veloped for soil nutrient
thresholds so that scientificallybased standards can be pro-mulgated and defended.
Source Area Delineation
Typically, more than 90%
of the P export from watershedsoriginates from less than 10%of the land area during a few
large storms.  Thus, remedial
measures will be most effectiveif they are targeted to source
areas of P export.  These are lands that combine high soilP concentrations with characteristics that enhance ero-
sion and surface runoff.
Source Management
N and P runoff can be greatly reduced if fertiliz-
ers are applied at rates that match the N and P uptake by
crops, and if fertilizers are applied when crops are grow-
ing rapidly.  Also, dietary P inputs to livestock can bematched to the animals requirements, which would de-

nonpoint source pollution can be reduced.  For ex-
ample, restoration of wetlands and increasing ri-
parian vegetation intercepts nonpoint pollution andalso provides wildlife habitat.

crease the amounts of P excreted in manure.  Source
management can significantly reduce concentrations of
P in runoff entering streams and lakes.  For example, ag-gressive treatment of dairy wastes in Florida reducedtotal P concentrations in surface water by 62% to87%.
T ransport Management
Transport of P and N from croplands to surface
waters by erosion and runoff may be reduced by main-taining vegetated riparian zones or buffer strips, creating
retention ponds, or adopting farming practices such as
conservation tillage, terracing, contour tillage, and covercrops.  Vegetated buffer strips in riparian zones, for ex-ample, reduce P transport to streams by 50% to 85%.However, such solutions must be combined with reduc-
tions in nutrient sources to soils or soil nutrients will con-
tinue to accumulate.
Control of Urban Runoff
Control of urban nonpoint pollution is a well-de-
veloped branch of civil engineering with an extensive and
sophisticated literature.  One key goal is optimization ofsewer systems.  Other approaches include creation ofretention ponds, wetlands, and greenways as integratedcomponents in stormwater management systems; litter
control and street sweeping; reduction of impervious ar-
eas such as concrete and a sphalt pavement that enhance
runoff; and reduction of erosion, especially from construc-tion sites.
Atmospheric Deposition
Atmospheric deposition of N can be reduced by
more efficient use of fertilizers and improved handling ofanimal wastes.  Thus, steps needed to reduce surfacemovement of agricultural N will also reduce atmospheric
transport.  Reductions in fossil fuel combustion, and im-
proved interception of nitrogen trace gases generatedduring fossil fuel combustion, will also reduce airborne Ndeposition.
CONCLUSIONS
We already have a sound fundamental under-
standing of the processes that cause nonpoint pollutionand eutrophication.  The causes and consequences are
clear at both regional and global scales.  Our capacity for
site-specific analyses of nonpoint sources and their im-pacts is well-developed and improving.  While science alonecannot solve the problem, the panel believes the neces-
sary science is available and could be readily mobilized in
the search for solutions. The most critical need now is forthe development of creative policy and regulatory mecha-nisms that mesh the science with social realities and charta course for reducing nonpoint pollution and mitigating
eutrophication of our waterways.
