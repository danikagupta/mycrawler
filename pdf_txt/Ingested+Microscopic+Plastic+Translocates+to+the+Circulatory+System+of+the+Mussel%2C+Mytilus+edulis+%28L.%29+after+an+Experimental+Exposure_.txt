Microplastics (MP; 1 µm–1 mm) of various shapes and composition s are ingested by numerous 
marine animals. Recently, proposals have been made to adopt biv alve molluscs as bioindicators 
of MP pollution. To serve as indicators of MP pollution, howeve r, the proposed organisms 
should ingest, without bias, th e majority of plastic particles to which they are exposed. To test 
this premise, eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica , and blue mussels, Mytilus edulis , were 
offered variously sized polystyrene microspheres (diameters 19-1000 µm) and nylon microfibers 
(lengths 75-1075 x 30 µm), and the proportion of each rejected in pseudofeces and egested in 
feces determined. For both species, the proportion of microsphe res rejected increased from ca. 
10-30% for the smallest spheres t o 98% for the largest spheres.  A higher proportion of the largest 
microsphere was rejected compared with the longest microfiber, but similar proportions of 
microfibers were ingested regar dless of length. Differential egestion of MP also occurred. As a 
result of particle selection, th e number and types of MP found in the bivalve gut will depend 
upon the physical characteristics of the particles. Thus, bival ves will be poor bioindicators of MP 
pollution in the environment, and it is advised that other marine species be explored.

Plastic debris in the marine environment is a wide-spread pollu tant interacting with, and 
affecting a range of organisms from larvae to vertebrates.
1,2 Equally problematic are the myriad 
of microplastic (MP) particles (1 µm – 1 mm)3 that are manufactured for consumer products or 
are produced as a result of macroplastic degradation.1,2,4 Marine waters globally are 
contaminated with a mixture of MP of various shapes (e.g., sphe rical, angular, fibers) and 
compositions (e.g., polystyrene, polypropylene, nylon, low- and high-density polyethylene). A 
large portion of MP particles are suspended in the water column, and are available for capture 
and ingestion by planktonic and benthic suspension feeders. Ingested MP can produce 
deleterious effects under cer tain laboratory conditions.5-12 
Recently, many studies have focused on the uptake of MP by suspension-feeding bivalve 
molluscs because they process la rge volumes of water per unit t ime, and capture particles as 
small as 3 µm with high efficiency (e.g., >50% depending on spe cies13-15). Studies have shown 
that bivalves ingest MP under ambient environmental conditions,16-21 and as such, it is assumed 
that these species will be one of the most impacted groups. Add itionally, because bivalves are 
broadly distributed, abundant, easily accessible, and sessile o rganisms, they have been used to 
monitor numerous environmental contaminants worldwide (e.g., U.S. Mussel Watch; 
Assessment and Control of Pollution in the Mediterranean region  [ M E D P O L ] ;  N o r t h  E a s t 
Atlantic Oslo and Paris Commission (OSPAR)).22-25 Recently, several workers have proposed 
that bivalves could also be used to assess the load of MP in di fferent environments.18-20, 26-32 
These proposals are based largely upon correlations between the types and abundance of MP in 
the environment and those found in the soft tissues of several bivalve species. Criteria required for taxa to be indicators of environmental impacts have been outlined previously.
25 Based upon 
these criteria, it is recommended that species proposed as bioindicators of MP pollution in the

100 101 102 environment should have the following characteristics: 1) be ub iquitous and relatively easy to 
collect; 2) interact significantl y with the surrounding environ ment through particle-feeding 
processes; and 3) ingest, without bias, the majority of plastic particles to which it is exposed. 
With respect to bivalves, a large body of research demonstrates that bivalves feed selectively on 
a range of particles, i.e., the y do not simply ingest all parti cles that are captured by the gills 
13,15 
Thus, bivalves would fail t o meet the third criterion. 
In this study, differently sized polystyrene microspheres and microfibers were delivered 
directly to the inhalant margin of the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica , and blue mussel, 
Mytilus edulis . Uptake and elimination of MP were assessed by determining the number of 
plastic particles rejected and egested in each size and shape category, and by examining the way 
in which particles were handled by the gill ( in vivo ) and eliminated at th e pseudofeces-discharge 
site (aka, principal-discharge area33). These data were then used to test the following null 
hypotheses: 1) the number of MP particles rejected in each size class equals the number of 
particles ingested (spheres or fibers); 2) the proportion of MP rejected in pseudofeces and 
egested in < 3 h is independent of size (spheres or fibers); 3) the proportion of large MP rejected 
is independent of shape (1000-µm  spheres vs 1075-µm fibers). 
METHODS 
Collection and maintenance of animals. Oysters, Crassostrea virginica , and mussels, 
Mytilus edulis , were collected from natural populations in Long Island Sound and cleaned of 
fouling organisms. A strip of Velcro® was secured to one shell of each animal using a two-part 
marine epoxy.34 Bivalves were placed in lantern nets and suspended from a dock adjacent to the 
University of Connecticut at Avery Point. They were held in the natural environment for several 
days before use in the experiments. Approximately 24 h before t he start of an experiment,

117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 oysters and mussels were secured to craft sticks by means of the attached Velcro®, placed in a 
large holding tray filled with aer ated, natural seawater (herea fter termed seawater), and 
transferred to an environmental chamber at 20º C under a 12 h light, 12 h dark cycle. They were 
fed the microalga Tetraselmis sp.
35 and allowed to acclimate to experimental conditions.  
Preparation of plastic particles. Fluorescent polystyrene microspheres with a median 
diameter of 19 µm, and non-fluores cent polystyrene microspheres with median diameters of 113, 
287, 510 and 1000 µm (density = 1.04 g/cm3, Table S1) were obtained from Polysciences, Inc. 
and Cospheric, Inc. The diameter of each microsphere size class was verified by light 
microscopy. Black nylon fibers (Nylon 6.6; ~30 µm width) were obtained from A.C. Moore, 
Inc., and cut to median lengths of 75, 587, and 1075 µm (densit y = 1.14 g/cm3; Table S1). The 
75 µm fibers were cut using a cryogenic microtome following pre viously published methods,36 
and the 587 and 1075 µm fibers were cut by hand with a razor bl ade under a stereomicroscope. 
The polymer compositions of micros pheres and microfibers were v erified with Raman 
(Renishaw System 2000, Renishaw plc) and FTIR (Nicolet Magna 560, Thermo Fisher Scientific) 
microspectroscopy. Recorded spectra were compared against commercial Raman and FTIR spectral libraries (KnowItAll® Sof tware, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc; Fig. S1). 
Concentrated stock suspensions of each particle type were prep ared in Milli-Q water. 
Working suspensions were prepared by diluting the stock suspensions with filtered seawater 
(GF/C filter, nominal pore size of 1.2 µm) and then aging the s uspensions at ca. 20º C for three 
days.
34,37 Aging MP in seawater better mimicked conditions in the natural environment. After 
aging, particles were used in experiments described below.  
Selection experiments. All experiments were conducted in an environmental chamber (20º 
C, 12 h:12 h light:dark cycle) following the general procedures used in previous experiments.38 
Oysters (5.2-7.9 cm shell height) and mussels (4.6-7.2 cm shell length) were offered MP in

141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 round plastic containers filled with 700 mL of filtered seawate r (cartridge filtered, nominal pore 
size = 0.2 µm; hereafter referred to as FSW). Containers were thoroughly cleaned and rinsed 
with deionized water prior to us e. One bivalve was positioned in each container by securing the 
craft stick to which it was attached, to the container rim by m eans of a wooden clip.
34  E a c h 
container was supplied with gentle aeration and an initial conc entration of microalgal food 
(Tetraselmis sp.) at 5000 cells/mL. Three different groups of oysters and m ussels were used in 
the experiments, with each group receiving one of three MP susp ensions. In Experiment 1, 
bivalves were offered a mixed microsphere suspension (four diff erent sizes, median diameters of 
19, 113, 287, and 510 µm); in Experiment 2, oysters and mussels were offered a mixed 
microfiber suspension (two different sizes, median lengths of 7 5 and 587 µm); and in 
Experiment 3, bivalves were offered a mixture of spheres and fi bers (median diameter of 1000 
µm and median length of 1075 µm). The number of particles in each size class offered to 
bivalves decreased with increasi ng sphere diameter or fiber len gth (Table S1).   
Bivalves were offered MP by slowly delivering a small volume o f one of the working 
suspensions near the inhalant aperture of an actively feeding a nimal using a micropipette.39,40 
Three, 200-µL aliquots were offered sequentially to each animal over 5 to 10 min during a single 
dosing period, with delivery of doses separated by 20 min. Wit h each dose, bivalves were 
offered (nominal number) 735 microspheres (Experiment 1, all si zes), 495 microfibers 
(Experiment 2, all sizes), or 34 spheres and fibers (Experiment 3, both sizes). Not all MP 
particles offered to the bivalves entered the mantle cavity as a result of the minute and 
instantaneous adjustments bivalves made in the position of the inhalant mantle margin and in 
pumping rate. Those that were dr awn into the mantle cavity were captured and represent the 
actual number of plastic particles to which the bivalves were e xposed. In total, animals were 
offered six doses over a 2-h time period. After the first, thi rd, and fifth dose, microalgal food

165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 (Tetraselmis sp.) was added to each container (concentration ca. 5000 cells / m L ) .   T h e  t o t a l 
concentration of particles to wh ich bivalves were exposed (micr oalgal cells, MP) was below the 
threshold that stimulates exces sive production of pseudofeces.
41-43 During the 2-h selection 
experiments, bivalves were continuously monitored and visible p seudofeces produced by the 
animals were collected. Any bivalve that closed before receivi ng at least five doses of MP was 
not used in the final analyses. 
At the end of the 2-h exposure period, bivalves were held for an additional 1 h in their 
original containers so that they could purge residual pseudofec e s  ( t o t a l o f  3  h  a f t e r  i n i t i a l 
exposure). Microalgal food was delivered at the same intervals as during the exposure period.  
Bivalves were then transferred to clean, aerated containers filled with filtered seawater and microalgal food ( Tetraselmis sp.) at a concentration of 1000 0 cells/mL and allowed to depurate 
MP. All discernable pseudofeces and feces in the original containers were identified under a stereomicroscope and collected in separate centrifuge tubes (15 mL). Importantly, identifying 
pseudofeces with the aid of a microscope was essential for two reasons: 1) at the low particle 
concentrations used, MP were ofte n rejected as individual parti cles or clumps containing several 
particles (verified by endoscopi c examination, see below) which  w e r e n o t  v i s i b l e  w i t h  t h e 
unaided eye; and 2) some MP particles were not captured by the bivalves and instead settled to 
the bottom of the container. Therefore, to distinguish between particles rejected as pseudofeces 
and those that settled to the bo ttom before entering the mantle cavity and being captured, only 
particles with a mucus corona (Figure S2) were collected as pse udofeces.  This approach ensured 
that estimates of the number of particles rejected were conserv ative values. Feces that were 
produced during the first 3 h were considered intestinal in ori gin, and were analyzed separately 
from glandular feces produced later in time
44. After 24 h, animals were again transferred to clean 
containers with seawater and microalgal food, and biodeposits collected as described above.

189 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 After 48 h, bivalves were removed from the containers, and final biodeposits collected. Twice 
each day during the depuration period, animals were delivered a volume of microalgal food 
(Tetraselmis sp.) to bring the final concentration in the containers to ca. 10000 cells/mL. 
Previous studies have demonstrated that > 90% of anthropogenic particles are egested by oysters 
and mussels within the first 48 h post-exposure.
37,45-49 Thus, the quantity of MP found in feces 
is representative of the quantity of plastic particles ingested . 
To release microspheres and microfibers from collected biodepo sits for numeration, samples 
were subjected to a digestion protocol. Each sample was first c entrifuged for 5 min at 1500 rcf 
(g). The seawater supernatant was decanted, the pellet resuspen ded in 5 ml of DI water, spun for 
another 5 minutes, and again de canted. This washing process was repeated two additional times 
to remove salts which react with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to for m a precipitate. After 
preparation, 2 mL of 1 N NaOH were added to each centrifuge tube.34 Samples were then 
resuspended by means of a Vortex Genie® and allowed to digest f or at least three days. After 
digestion, samples were diluted with 2 mL of DI water to bring the total volume of each to ca. 
4.0 ml. Sub-samples (1 mL) were added to a rafter cell and the number of microspheres and 
fibers in each size class counted under a stereo or compound microscope (depending upon size). 
For the 19-µm spheres, counts were performed by means of fluore scent microscopy. Three to 
four replicate counts were performed for each sample. The numbe r of particles per mL was then 
multiplied by the volume of sample to obtain the total number o f plastic particles of each size 
class that were rejected or ingested. When analyzing samples o f pseudofeces and feces from 
bivalves exposed to 75- and 587-µm fibers, tightly bound agglom erates often were observed. As 
there was no way to determine when the agglomerates formed (i.e ., during production of 
biodeposits, prior to, or after treatment with NaOH), individua l particles in agglomerates with 
five or more fibers were not counted. Instead the agglomerates were quantified. No significant

213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 221 222 differences were found between the number of agglomerates in ps eudofeces and feces produced 
by either oysters or mussels  (p>0.1, paired t-test).  
Data analysis. Separate tests were conducted for each species of bivalve. Two -way mixed 
model analysis of variance (ANOVA, GLM) for repeated measures p rocedures were used to 
compare the number of particles rejected (pseudofeces) to that ingested (total in all feces) using 
particle size and biodeposit type (pseudofeces, feces) as fixed effects and individual bivalves as 
the random effect. Separate models were run for Experiment 1 (mixed microspheres) and 
Experiment 2 (mixed microfibers). For microsphere data, both o yster and mussel models 
demonstrated a significant inter action effect between size and biodeposit type (p < 0.001). 
Therefore, each model was divided, and paired t-tests used to e xamine differences in the number 
of particles rejected versus i ngested in each size class. For microfiber data, only the model for 
mussels showed significant treatment effects. Differences in th e mean number of particles 
rejected versus ingested for each size class were determined using a multi-comparison test 
(Tukey’s HSD). Paired t-tests were also used to compare the nu mber of 1075-µm fibers and 
1000-µm beads rejected and ingested by oysters and mussels (Experiment 3).  
One-way mixed-model ANOVA (GLM) for repeated measures procedur es were used to 
compare the proportion of particles rejected and proportion of particles egested in <3 h using particle size as the fixed eff ect and individual bivalves (oyst ers or mussels) as the random effect. 
The proportion of microplastics rejected (spheres or fibers) wa s calculated as number rejected ÷ 
total number of captured partic les (number in pseudofeces, intestinal feces, glandular feces).  The 
proportion of microplastics egest ed in < 3 h was calculated as number in intestinal feces ÷ total 
number in both intestinal and glandular feces. Separate models were run for Experiment 1 
(microspheres) and Experiment 2 (microfibers). If significant differences were found, a multi-
comparison test (Tukey’s HSD) was used to determine differences  between means.  Paired t-tests

237 238 239 240 241 242 243 244 245 246 were used to compare the proportion of the largest microspheres (1000 µm) and microfibers 
(1075 µm) rejected in pseudofeces (same group of oysters or mus sels, experiment 3). Two-
sample t-tests were used to compare the proportion of 1000-µm and 510-µm spheres, and 
proportion of 1075-µm and 587-µm fibers rejected in pseudofeces (two different groups of 
oysters, or two different groups of mussels, comparison of sele cted data from Experiments 1, 2 
and 3). Prior to analyses, data were tested for normality and homoscedasticity, and transformed 
(square root) if required. Statistical analyses were performed using Systat 13, and for all tests an alpha level of 0.05 was used. 
Endoscopic examination. Detailed observations of the production of pseudofeces and the 
handling of plastic particles on the gills and labial palps of oysters and mussels were 
accomplished by means of video endoscopy.
50,51 The endoscope, optical adapter, and attached 
CCD camera (Cohu, Inc.) were mounted onto a micromanipulator to enable fine positioning 
around the pseudofeces-discharge site and within the mantle cav ity. This site is the region of the 
mantle at which pseudofeces are rejected and varies with specie s of bivalve. For oysters, the site 
is located at the anteroventral region of the mantle, adjacent to the labial palps. In contrast, for 
mussels, the site is located at the most posterior region of th e mantle, near the junction between 
the inhalant aperture and exha lant siphon. Digital video was re corded onto 8-mm videocassettes 
(Hi-8, Sony) for archival purposes. Representative video seque nces were captured and saved to 
a computer hard drive using Movie Maker (Microsoft). Still ima ges were captured from video 
segments using VideoPad Editor (NCH Software), and minor adjust ments to brightness and 
contrast were made to improve clarity.     
Oysters (7.4-11.5 cm shell height) and mussels (6.8-8.0 cm shell length) were acclimated to 
laboratory conditions in a 38-L aquarium filled with aerated, f iltered seawater (20-22 ºC). 
Animals were delivered microalgal food ad libitum , consisting of a mixture of the microalga

269 Tetraselmis  sp. and Shellfish Diet (Reed Mar iculture), and 50% of the wate r in the aquarium was 
changed daily. Prior to internal observations, a small portion of the ventral region of the shell of 
each oyster and mussel was trimmed to accommodate the optical i nsertion tube (OIT) of the 
endoscope and prevent damage to the tube when the animal adduct ed its valves.  Shell material 
was carefully removed without damaging the underlying mantle, a nd animals were allowed to 
recover for one day before being examined.
52-54 Prior to endoscopic observation, each bivalve 
was placed in a 1-L aerated chamber filled with filtered seawat er (ca. 21 ºC), delivered several 
mL of microalgal food ( Tetraselmis sp.), and allowed to acclimate to experimental conditions.  
Observations were made after the animal opened its valves and s howed signs of feeding (i.e. 
shells open, mantles extended).    
Two different observational assays were performed. In the first, the endoscope was oriented 
near the pseudofeces-discharge site, and the relative form and amount of pseudofeces produced 
was assessed (individual particles, small particle clumps, larg e particle bolus). In the second 
assay, the OIT was inserted between the valves of the bivalve a nd observations made of the 
capture and transport of plastic particles on the gills and labial palps. As in the selection 
experiments, mixed microspheres, mixed microfibers, and a mixture of large microspheres and 
microfibers were offered to the bivalves. Three, 200-µL aliquo ts were offered sequentially to 
each animal over 5 to 10 min during a single dosing period, wit h delivery of doses separated by 
20 min. For the second assay, occasionally it was necessary to deliver near the inhalant aperture 
more than three aliquots of MP suspension in order to observe p article capture in the small area 
of the gill that was being examined.

mussels depended upon particle size (Table 1). For oysters, a significantly lower number of 19-
µm spheres was rejected in pseudofeces compared to that ingeste d ,  w h e r e a s  f o r  t h e  l a r g e r 
diameter spheres (287, 510, 1000 µm), significantly higher numb ers were rejected (P<0.01).  
Equal numbers of 113-µm spheres were rejected and ingested. Mussels showed a similar trend, 
but rejected significantly lower numbers of 19- and 113-µm spheres and rejected a significantly 
higher number of 1000-µm spheres compared to that ingested (P<0.01; Table 1). Equal numbers of 287- and 510-µm spheres were rejected and ingested. Notably , no 1000-μm spheres were 
ingested by either oysters or mussels. The rejection and ingestion of microfibers by the bivalves showed a different trend (Table 1). Oysters rejected and ingested equal numbers of fibers 
regardless of size. In contrast, mussels rejected a significan tly lower number of 587- and 1075-
µm fibers (P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively), and rejected and i ngested equal numbers of 75-µm 
fibers. 
For both oysters and mussels, the proportion of microspheres r ejected in pseudofeces 
increased with sphere size, whereas rejection of fibers was var iable and showed no trend with 
size (Figure 1A, B). Significan tly different proportions of spheres were rejected by oysters 
across the 19-, 113-, 287- and 510-μm size classes (P < 0.01). No difference was found in the 
proportions of 287- and 510-μm spheres rejected. Mussels also r ejected significantly different 
proportions of spheres across the four size classes (P<0.05), b ut no differences were found 
between 113-μm spheres and the 19- and 287-μm spheres (Figure 1 A). For both species, a 
significantly higher proportion of 1000-μm spheres was rejected compared to the proportion of 
510-μm spheres rejected (P<0.05). In contrast, there was no si gnificant difference in the 
proportion of 75- and 587-μm fibers, or between the proportion of 587- and 1075-μm fibers 
rejected by either species (Figure 1B).

308 309 310 311 312 313 314 315 316 317 Additionally, for both oysters and mussels, the proportions of ingested 510-μm spheres that 
were egested in < 3 h was significantly higher than those of th e other three size classes (P<0.01; 
Figure 1C). No differences were found between t he 19-, 113-, and 287-μm size classes for either 
species. The proportions of 75- and 587-μm fibers egested by o ysters in < 3 h were not 
significantly different, nor were the proportions of egested 58 7- and 1075-μm fibers (Figure 1D). 
In contrast, although the propor tions of 75- and 587-μm fibers egested by mussels in < 3 h were 
not significantly different, there was a significant difference in the proportions of egested 587- 
and 1075-μm fibers (P<0.01). A lower proportion of the longer fibers was egested by mussels in 
< 3 h (Figure 1D). 
When microspheres and microfibers were delivered simultaneousl y, both oysters and mussels 
rejected a significantly higher proportion of 1000-μm diameter spheres than 1075-µm long fibers 
(oysters P<0.05, mussels  P<0.01; Figure 2).  
Endoscopic examination. Examinations in vivo indicated that the gills of oysters and 
mussels could capture and trans port all sizes of microspheres a nd microfibers (Figure 3A, B). 
The heterorhabdic gills of oysters generally carried larger sph eres (diameter > 19 µm) and fibers 
(length > 75 µm) to the ventral (aka, marginal) grooves, and sm aller particles to the dorsal (aka, 
basal) tracts. Upon entering the grooves and tracts, MP were transported anteriorly towards the labial palps. The homorhabdic gills of mussels carried all MP t o the ventral grooves. In both 
species, large spheres (e.g., 510 µm) rotated on the frontal su rface during ciliary transport, and 
large fibers (587 and 1075 µm) were oriented parallel to the an terior-posterior axis before 
entering the ventral grooves. Examination of the pseudofeces-d ischarge sites on the mantle 
provided information on the proc ess by which plas tic particles are rejected.  Oysters accumulated 
MP destined for rejection in mucous boluses of various sizes. Periodically, oysters adducted 
their valves and ejected the material from the mantle cavity which often caused the boluses to

E), and the process of accumulation and ejection often took 20 min or longer. Mussels also 
rejected MP of all sizes and shapes. Generally, microspheres w ere ejected as singlets, doublets, 
or in small boluses (Figure 3D). Large fibers (587 µm) were re leased individually or in mucous 
boluses containing smaller fibers (75 µm; Figure 3F). Typicall y, spheres and fibers began to be 
rejected within 20 min of exposure. Importantly, most of the ps eudofeces rejected by oysters and 
mussels, including the small bolus es, were too small to be seen  by the unaided eye.   
DISCUSSION 
The quantitative data provided here falsify all three null hyp otheses. Oysters and mussels did 
not ingest all encountered MP indi scriminately. Rather, they re jected a higher proportion of large 
spheres and ingested a higher proportion of small spheres. Although there were no similar 
relationships with fibers, on average oysters rejected >50% and  m ussels >20% of all fibers to 
which they were exposed. Differences between the two species ma y reflect the more complex 
heterorhabdic gill structure of oysters, which perform bidirectional transport and particle 
selection.
55-58 The homorhabdic gill structure of mussels perform predominatel y unidirectional 
transport and cannot carry out particle selection.51,59 As a result, oysters have two sites for 
particles selection (gills and labial palps), whereas mussels h ave only one (labial palps). The 
rejection of all microspheres wi th a diameter of 1000 µm by bot h species of bivalves 
demonstrates that there is an upper limit to the size of plasti c particles that can be handled and 
ingested. In this study, the lim it for ingestion was 1000 µm fo r low aspect-ratio particles (e.g. 
spheres, fragments). For particles with a high aspect ratio, such as fibers, handling and ingestion 
is less constrained provided that one dimension is within the s ize that can be ingested. Although 
the current study did not test the selection of MP < 19 µm in size, previous studies have

356 357 358 359 360 361 362 363 364 365 demonstrated that synthetic particles with a diameter of 10 µm (e.g., alumina, silica, polystyrene) 
can be preferentially ingested or rejected based on their surfa ce properties (i.e., surface charge, 
wettability, organic coating) 
45,60  T h eref o re, ev en  p last ic p art icle s sm alle r th an  1 9 µm  can  be 
subjected to the selection proce ss and potentially be rejected or ingested depending on their 
surface characteristics. Results of the current study are congr uent with those of previous research 
that has examined the selection of plastic particles by bivalve s.46, 60-62 For example, using 
different diameters of glass and polystyrene microspheres (10, 40, 150, 275, 370, 410 µm), Tamburri and Zimmer-Faust
46 found that oysters ( C. virginica ) rejected 30-40% of the smallest 
spheres and ca. 100% of the largest spheres, regardless of sphe re type. Woods et al.62 examined 
the rejection and ingestion of polyethylene terephthalate fibers (ca. 460 µm in length) by mussels 
(M. edulis ). They found that at a concentration of 30 x 103 microfibers/L, mussels rejected 71% 
of the fibers in pseudofeces, w ith only ca. 9% of the particles  being ingested.     
The residence time of MP within the gut of bivalves also can b e affected by microsphere size, 
with particles <500 µm being re tained longer. For oysters, no relationship was found between 
length of microfiber and proportion egested in < 3 h; however, ca. 70% of all fibers were egested 
within this time period. For mussels, a lower proportion of th e longest microfibers were egested 
in < 3 h compared to the shorter fibers, suggesting that the gu t residence time for these fibers is 
higher. Post-ingestive selection of MP by bivalves has been dem onstrated previously.63,64  In a 
study on the sea scallop, Placopecten magellanicus , Brillant and MacDonald64 found that 20-μm 
polystyrene spheres were retained in the gut longer than 5-μm spheres. They also reported that 
residence time of 9-μm polystyrene spheres was longer than that of similar-sized glass spheres (8 
μm) with a higher density. None of the spheres, however, were observed in histological sections 
of the digestive gland, suggesting that the differential treatm ent of spheres occurred in the 
stomach. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the selection of plastic particles in the gut

380 381 382 383 384 385 386 387 388 389 65-67 of bivalves occurs, and the time course over which MP are egest ed will depend on particle size 
and shape. 
Qualitative results from in vivo examinations demonstrate that MP of different sizes and 
shapes are captured and handled by the feeding organs in the sa me manner as natural particles.53, 
Additionally, examination of the pseudofeces-discharge sites o f oysters and mussels 
provided information that has implications for previous and future studies on interactions 
between MP and bivalves. The observations presented here demons trate that at low 
concentrations, bivalves can rej ect individual plastic particle s or small particle masses that 
cannot be seen with the unaided eye. This fact has not been app reciated by many previous 
workers who have collected biodeposits without the aid of a microscope. By doing so, they have 
likely underestimated the number of plastic particles rejected, because not all of the rejected 
pseudofecal material was collected, and over-estimated the numb er of plastic particles that were 
ingested, because the feces were contaminated with pseudofeces.12,62,68 Such errors have led 
some researchers to suggest, incorrectly, that the quantity and types of MP ingested by bivalves 
accurately represent those suspended in the natural environment . Future studies that aim to 
examine selection of MP by bivalves under environmentally-relevant concentrations should differentiate and collect biodeposits with the aid of a microsc ope.   
The presented data clearly dem onstrate that MP size and shape affects the reje ction, ingestion, 
and egestion of plastic particles by oysters and mussels. These results are congruent with 
previous laboratory st udies on particle feeding in bivalves, and support the results of field studies 
that examined uptake of MP by mussels.
21,49 For example, in a recent study Zhao et al.21 
quantified the number and type of MP in mussels ( M. edulis ) and suspended marine aggregates 
in samples collected during two different months of the year. C alculations of the number of 
plastic particles that mussels encountered per day, based on kn own clearance rates and the 
17  390 measured abundance of microplastics in aggregates, demonstrated  that mussels contained only ca.   
1% of the available MP   in their digestive gland   and gut. Theref ore, a  large portion of plastic 
particles were likely rejected   or rapidly egested   in feces. Alt hough MP abundances in marine 
aggregates varied significantly over time, no temporal differen ces in the abundance of plastic 
particles ingested by mussels were observed.  These data demonstrate the consistency of particle-
feeding processes of mussels (e.g., capture efficiency, particl e  selection).   
 Results of the current study a nd the rich body of  literature o n particle-selection capabilities of 
many bivalve species13,15,69  clearly demonstrate that bivalve s are not robust indicators of  M P  
pollution, and explain why the number of MP identified in bival ves is typically low compared to 
that in the environment.21,  29,49   The quantity and   quality of   MP identified in bivalves collect ed in  
situ  will not be a good proxy for the concentration and type suspen ded in the water, and will be   
biased toward small, low aspect- ratio particles (e.g., spheres) and high aspect-rati o particles (e.g., 
fibers).  If the loads of MP to which bivalves are exposed in t he environment are episodic rather 
than constant (e.g., higher concentrations after a  wind-induced   resuspension event), the time 
course over which plastics   of different size and shape are eges ted will further   complicate   
attempts to extract environmental information.  It is strongly advised that other marine species be 
explored as sentinel organisms of MP pollution. 391 392 393 394 395 396 397 398 399 400 401 402

aNote that number of spheres and fibers offe red per dose and total number offered should be 
considered nominal.  Not all pa rticles offered were drawn into the mantle cavity and captured by 
the bivalves so the actual intern al exposure was lower.  The num ber of particles captured in each 
size class is the total identified in pseudofeces and feces (intestinal and glandular). *In most 
cases, 6 doses were offered to each bivalve; tdata are means ± standard deviation in parentheses

µm fibers from the frontal surface to the ventral margin of the gill.  Note fibers entering the 
groove proper. Particles are bei ng transported anteriorly (left) to the labial palps and mouth.  
Magnification ca. 150x. 
2) Mussel frontal-ventral spheres - ( Mytilus edulis ) In vivo, real-time vide o of the transport of 
different size spheres from the frontal surface to th e ventral margin of the gill.  Note that larger 
spheres are transported anteriorly on the margin (more likely rejected) whereas smaller spheres 
(19 µm, yellow) are transported in the groove proper (more likely ingested).  Particles are being 
transported anteriorly (lef t) to the labial palps an d mouth. Magnification ca. 150x. 
3) Mussel pseudofeces small and large spheres - ( Mytilus edulis ) Real-time video of the 
rejection of two large (ca. 287 µm) and small (c a. 113 µm) spheres at the pseudofeces-discharge 
site. This site is located at the most posterior  region of the mantle, near  the junction between the 
inhalant aperture and exhalant  siphon.  The rejected microplas tics could not be seen by the 
unaided eye. Magnification ca. 150x. 
4) Mussel pseudofeces small fibers - ( Mytilus edulis ) Real-time video of th e rejection of a bolus 
of fibers (ca. 75 µm and 587 µm) at the pseudofeces -discharge site (for location, see description 
of video #2). The rejected bolus (ca. 250 µm wide) could not be seen by the unaided eye. 
Magnification ca. 150x. 5) Oyster frontal-ventral-dorsal fibers - ( Crassostrea virginica ) In vivo, real-time video of the 
transport of fibers (75 µm, 587 µm) from the front al surface to the ventral margin of the gill.
