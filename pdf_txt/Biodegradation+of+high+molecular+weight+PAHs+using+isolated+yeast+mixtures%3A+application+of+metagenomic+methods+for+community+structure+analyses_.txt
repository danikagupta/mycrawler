Sewage sludge ABSTRACT  
Ibuprofen (IBP) is a widely used drug of environmental concern as emerging contaminant due to its low elim-
ination rates by wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), leading to the contamination of the environment, where 
IBP is introduced mainly from wastewater discharge and sewage sludge used as fertilizer. This study describes 
the application of a consortium from sewage sludge and acclimated with ibuprofen (consortium C7) to accelerate 
its biodegradation both in solution and sewage sludge. 500 mg L-1 IBP was degraded in solution in 28 h, and 66% 
mineralized in 3 days. IBP adsorbed in sewage sludge (10 mg kg-1) was removed after bioaugmentation with C7 
up to 90% in 16 days, with a 5-fold increase in degradation rate. This is the first time that bioaugmentation with 
bacterial consortia or isolated bacterial strains have been used for IBP degradation in sewage sludge. The bac-
terial community of consortium C7 was significantly enriched in Sphingomonas wittichii, Bordetella petrii, Pseu-
domonas stutzeri and Bosea genosp. after IBP degradation, with a special increase in abundance of S. wittichii , 
probably the main potential bacterial specie responsible for IBP mineralization. Thirteen bacterial strains were 
isolated from C7 consortium. All of them degraded IBP in presence of glucose, especially Labrys neptuniae . Eight 
of these bacterial strains (B. tritici, L. neptuniae, S. zoogloeoides, B. petrii, A. denitrificans, S. acidaminiphila, P. 
nitroreducens, C. flaccumfaciens ) had not been previously described as IBP-degraders. The bacterial community 
that makes up the indigenous consortium C7 appears to have a highly efficient biotic degradation potential to 
facilitate bioremediation of ibuprofen in contaminated effluents as well as in sewage sludge generated in WWTPs.

21.Introduction 
Ibuprofen (IBP) belong to the group of non-steroidal anti-inflam -
matory drugs (NSAIDs) used to treat pain and inflammation, and is the 
third most consumed drug in the world [45], with an annual output 
about 45,233 tons in 2022 [86]. Within Europe, IBP is considered by the 
Priority Substance Directive [22] and the EU commission [19] as 
candidate for the relatively short priority substance list under the Water 
Framework Directive [81]. Austin et al. [8] used the model ePIE 
(exposure to Pharmaceuticals in the Environment) to predict IBP con-
centrations in water bodies of several European countries, observing 
that its per capita consumption varied by nearly a factor of 10, with 
Spain having the highest usage (14,666 mg) and France the lowest 
(1809 mg). High amounts of IBP and its metabolites are excreted by 
humans and collected at the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). 
Although different treatments are applied, IBP elimination is not com-
plete, remaining in part in the effluent treated waters and in part 
adsorbed on sewage sludge due to the high hydrophobic character of IBP 
molecule. WWTPs effluents are discharged in surface waters or used for 
soil irrigation, and IBP can be utilized by plants or aquatic organisms. 
Also the direct sewage sludge discharge on soils as fertilizers is a way to 
enter IBP and other organic contaminants into soils [36], and also into 
groundwater by leaching due to soil irrigation. Due to its for over con-
sumption and inappropriate disposal, the presence of IBP has been 
detected in different environmental compartments (wastewater, surface 
water, groundwater, sludge, soils, sediments) [89]. In the era of the 
COVID-19 pandemic, drugs belonging to NSAIDs were detected in the 
world ’s water systems at concentrations ranging from a few nanograms 
to hundreds of micrograms per litre, being the most frequently detected 
diclofenac, IBP, naproxen, acetaminophen and ketoprofen [84]. In 
Spain, IBP (73–126 ng/L) was detected in urban groundwater in the 
urbanized areas of the metropolitan district of Barcelona [35]. In sewage 
sludge, the higher concentrations have been described for antibiotics 
and NSAIDS, being IBP one of the most frequently detected [44]. 
Although the concentrations of IBP and its metabolites which reach the 
environment are not excessively high, their continuous introduction in 
the different ecosystems results in long-term exposure. Therefore, IBP is 
considered as an emerging pollutant, since it is an artificial substance 
introduced in the environment from anthropogenic uses and activities, 
causing damage to ecosystem [15]. Praveenkumarreddy et al. [61] 
calculated Hazard Quotient (HQ) for various aquatic organisms for the 
effluents of WWTPs and river water, observing that IBP was toxic to 
Vibrio fischeri , Daphnia magna and algae. Also Thalla and Vannarath [76] 
have shown a high ecotoxicological risk of IBP contained in urban 
wastewater for fish and algae; Ajibola et al. [4] observed toxic effects of 
wastewater from treatment plants located near hospitals for fishes, and 
Parolini [60] detected IBP in the tissue of freshwater invertebrates. The 
accumulation of IBP and its metabolites in plant tissues have been also 
observed, with the potential transfer to other organisms, including 
humans, although their concentrations were not able to induce 
phyto-toxic effects [20,82] . 
Considering the wide use of IBP worldwide and the ecological risks 
involved, its removal from water and sewage sludge in WWTPs should 
be of priority interest since this is the unique opportunity to remove IBP 
before its release and dispersion in the environment. Physical, chemical 
and biological methods have been proposed for IBP removal from 
wastewater and sludge [15]. Among the physical methods, the adsorp -
tion on different matrices/filters is the most used: activated carbon 
(powder and granular), activated biochar, graphene, clay materials, 
polymer adsorbents, etc. [73]. IBP removal by chemical methods 
include advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) such as Fenton processes, 
TiO2 photocatalysis, plasma oxidation, ozonation, or electrochemical 
oxidation processes [21,28] . However, research in advanced oxidation 
processes is still at an early stage, and IBP metabolites produced in these 
processes are usually more toxic than the parent compound [23]. Bio-
logical methods proposed to remove organic contaminants in general include the use of microorganisms (bacteria, fungus and algae) to 
degrade specific pollutants [65]. The use of bioremediation methods 
provides advantages because it is a cost-effective and environmentally 
friendly technique that offers the possibility to destroy or produce 
harmless organic contaminants using natural biological activity, and 
usually is well accepted by the general public [51]. 
In the case of IBP, studies on fungal and algal strains were limited 
[11], but several bacterial strains were known to degrade it [16,46,72, 
87], although only a few of them were able to mineralize IBP, belonging 
most of them to the family Sphingomonadaceae , such as Sphingomonas sp. 
Ibu-2 [53,54] , Sphingobium yanoikuyae [10], Rhizorhabdus wittichii 
MPO218 [6], or Sphingopyxis granuli RW412 [3] Most of the studies have 
been conducted at a laboratory scale, not being applied in the envi-
ronment yet. 
In relation to microbial consortia, to date very few studies have been 
carried out for IBP degradation, and most of them used directly activated 
sludge from WWTPs without any enrichment with IBP [13,25,26,33,63, 
64,90] . Chen et al. [14] used a consortium from WWTP activated sludge 
but after six enrichment cultures with IBP. Other microbial consortia 
different from activated sludge were also used such as the microbial 
community from river sediments affected by a WWTP [71], or from 
surface water enriched with IBP [27]. As far as we know, there are no 
more studies using enriched microbial consortia for IBP biodegradation, 
but there are some studies using bacterial consortia prepared with 
defined bacterial strains. Marchlewicz et al. [47] used a consortia pre-
pared with Bacillus thuringiensis B1(2015b) Pseudomonas moorei KB4, 
and Wittich et al. [83] have described a consortia formed by Pseudo -
monas citronellolis RW422, RW423, RW424 which was able to mineralize 
IBP. 
With regard to sewage sludge, so far only a few studies have inves -
tigated the removal of organic contaminants in general from sludge 
through bioaugmentation using bacteria as well as fungi or yeasts [29, 
39,75] . In the case of pharmaceutical products, studies on sludge 
treatment to achieve its decontamination have been much more scarce. 
Rodríguez-Rodríguez et al. [70] y Vilaplana et al. [79] observed that 
bioaugmentation using the white-rot fungus Trametes versicolor resulted 
in the degradation of several emerging pollutants (certain pharmaceu -
tical products, polybrominated flame retardants, UV filters). Aydin [9] 
also used this fungus to biodegrade antibiotics in the sludge from a 
pharmaceutical industry. But, as far as we know, only Liu et al. [41] used 
bacterial consortia for gentamicin biodegradation in synthetic medium 
and raw gentamicin sewage. 
Based on these knowledge gaps highlighted, in this work we have 
performed enrichment cultures from sewage sludge samples, a reservoir 
of diverse microbes with a high degradation potential for pharmaceu -
ticals. The objectives of the current study were: (i) to obtain aerobic 
bacterial consortium and isolated bacterial strains capable of reaching 
the degradation of IBP; (ii) to assess the degradation efficiency of IBP 
both in solution and in sewage sludge under different conditions; (iii) to 
investigate bacterial community changes in the enriched ibuprofen- 
degrading biomass using high-throughput sequencing techniques to 
identify the main bacterial groups potentially involved in IBP 
bioremoval. 
2.Materials and methods 
2.1. Chemical, materials and culture media 
The analytical standards of IBP (C13H18O2, purity F98%, CAS: 
15687 –27–1, molecular weight: 206.28 g mol-1) and IBP sodium salt 
(C13H17O2Na, purity F98%, CAS: 31121 –93–4, molecular weight: 
228.26 g mol-1) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Madrid, Spain). 
The fresh sewage sludge was collected from a wastewater treatment 
plant (WWTP) in Seville (Southwest Spain). The most relevant physi -
cochemical properties of the sludge used were described by Vargas- 
Ord˘o~nez et al. [78], with an organic matter content of 48% and pH 8.25. I. Aguilar-Romero et al.

3The mineral salt medium (MSM) contains the following components (per 
liter of deionized water): 0.5 g of KH2PO4, 0.5 g of K2HPO 4, 0.01 g of 
NaCl, 0.2 g of MgCl 2⋅6 H2O, 0.02 g of CaCl 2, 1 g of (NH 4)SO4, 0.339 mg 
of MnSO 4, 0.428 mg of ZnSO 4, 0.347 mg of (NH 4)6Mo7O24⋅4 H2O, 0.4 
mg of CoCl 2⋅6 H2O, 5 mg of FeSO 4⋅7 H2O, 0.2 mg of CuSO 4⋅5 H2O, and 
10 mg of EDTA. The pH was adjusted to 7.3 ±0.1 with 1 M NaOH. 
Luria-Bertani (LB) broth contains (per liter of deionized water): 10 g 
tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, and 10 g NaCl (BD Difco ™, Fisher Scientific). 
For LB-agar and MSM-agar media, 20 g L-1 of bacto agar or Difco ®Agar 
Noble (BD Biosciences) were added to LB and MSM media, respectively. 
All culture media were autoclaved at 121 •C for 20 min. 
2.2. Enrichment culture 
The IBP-degrader consortium was obtained through an enrichment 
culture adding 5 g of activated sludge in 45 mL of MSM medium sup-
plemented with IBP (an amount of solid IBP corresponding to 200 mg L- 
1) as sole carbon source. The culture was incubated at 30 ºC on a rotatory 
shaker at 180 rpm. Weekly, 5 mL of the culture was transferred to 
another flask with 45 mL of fresh MSM medium spiked with IBP (200 
mg L-1) and incubated again in the same conditions. After seven 
enrichment transfers, the consortium C7 was obtained. An aliquot of the 
resulting consortium was stored in Eppendorf microtubes containing 
20% of glycerol (v/v), and kept at  80•C. 
2.3. Acclimatization and biodegradation assay with IBP-degrader 
consortium 
To achieve a faster biodegradation process, Consortium C7 was 
subjected to an acclimatization process. A pre-inoculum was prepared 
cultivating the consortium C7 in LB medium supplemented with IBP 
sodium salt (500 mg L-1) at 30 •C on a shaker at 180 rpm. After 24 h, cells 
were harvested through centrifugation (7000 rpm, 10 min) and the 
resultant pellet obtained was washed twice in MSM medium. Then, the 
acclimatized consortium was inoculated in triplicated in flasks with 50 
mL of MSM supplemented with IBP sodium salt (500 mg L-1) as sole 
carbon and energy source at an initial optical density (OD 600 nm) of 0.1 
and incubated for 7 days (30 •C, 180 rpm). Non-inoculated flasks were 
incubated in parallel as abiotic control. At different incubation times, 1 
mL samples were taken from the flasks to determine IBP residues 
remaining in solution. Samples were subjected to three cycles of freezing 
and thawing in order to break the cell walls, ensuring the recovery of IBP 
accumulated in the microbial biomass. Afterwards, samples were 
centrifuged at 11,000 rpm for 2 min and IBP concentration measured in 
the supernatant at different times by a HPLC analyser coupled to an 
UV–vis detector (LC-2010AHT, Shimadzu), with a C-18 column (4 ×150 
mm) and methanol:water (80:20) as mobile phase, acidified at pH 3 with 
orthophosphoric acid (1%), at a flow rate of 1.2 mL min-1. The detection 
wavelength was 210 nm and the injection volume was 25 µL, and the 
detection limit was 0.05 mg L-1 of IBP. Bacterial growth was determined 
by optical density (OD 600 nm) on a VWR UV-3100 spectrophotometer 
and by colony-forming units (CFUs) of serial dilutions on LB-agar me-
dium plates. 
After acclimatization process, IBP biodegradation assays in solution 
using C7 consortium were performed in triplicate. Cells from the accli-
matized culture were harvested by centrifugation (7000 rpm, 10 min) 
after 7 days, when no IBP was detected in the culture medium, and 
inoculated at an initial OD600 nm of 0.1 into new flasks with 20 mL of 
fresh MSM medium and different initial concentrations of IBP (1, 10, 
100, 500 and 1000 mg L-1) as sole carbon and energy source. These 
solutions were incubated on a temperature-controlled rotary shaker at 
180 rpm and 30 ±1 •C and protected from light, and at pH 7. The in-
fluence of other temperatures (20 •C and 40 •C) and pH (6 and 8) 
conditions on IBP degradation in solution with C7 consortium was car-
ried out at the initial concentration of 500 mg L-1. IBP concentration and 
bacterial growth were monitored at different times as previously described. 
The possibility of IBP mineralization in solution by inoculating C7 
consortium was studied using an OxiTop ® BOD measuring system 
(OxiTop ® IS 6 kit bottles) situated in a climate exposure test cabinet (30 
±1 •C) (WTW GmbH, Weilheim, Germany). This equipment is a 
manometric respirometer in a closed system. The produced CO2 due to 
the microorganism ’s respiratory process is adsorbed by soda-lime 
granules contained in the measuring heads of the OxiTop ® bottles. 
The resulting pressure decrease shows the corresponding oxygen con-
sumption, which was automatically calculated by the system. The Oxi-
Top® bottles (500 mL) contained 97 mL of 500 mg L-1 Na-IBP as sole 
carbon and energy source in MSM solution, and were inoculated with 
the acclimatized consortium C7 at an initial optical density (OD 600 nm) of 
0.1 in triplicate and were left to incubate for 5 days. Blank control 
bottles without inoculation were also run. 
2.4. Ecotoxicity bioassays 
At different times in biodegradation process in solution using C7 
consortium, the inhibitory effect of IBP and/or possible metabolites 
produced was studied through ecotoxicity assays based on the light 
emission of freeze-dried luminescent bacteria Aliivibrio fischeri , accord -
ing to ISO 11348 –3 [32]. The solutions were filtered to remove the 
remaining particulate matter and diluted with NaCl (2%) at 50%, 25%, 
12.5% and 6.25% (v/v). A Microtox model 500 Analyser (Modern Water 
Inc., USA) was used to measure the decrease in luminescence after 
15-min contact and compared with the control. EC50 value (IBP con-
centration (% v/v) having a toxic effect on 50% of the bacterial popu -
lation) was calculated and expressed in Toxic Units (TU): TU 
100/EC 50 [43]. 
2.5. Total DNA extraction and bacterial community analysis of C7 
consortium 
To determine the bacterial community enriched in the acclimatiza -
tion process and to identify potentially taxonomic groups involved in the 
IBP-degradation, total DNA was extracted in triplicate from 1 mL of the 
acclimatization culture at 4 and 7 days, as well as from the pre-inoculum 
(considered as time 0 days) using the G-spin ™ Total DNA Extraction Kit 
(iNtRON Biotechnology, Inc). The quality and concentration of DNA 
were analysed by NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All DNA 
samples were submitted for high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon 
sequencing to the Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Service at 
the Institute of Biomedicine of Seville (IBIS). The V3-V4 variable regions 
of the 16S rRNA gene were amplified by PCR using universal primers 
341 F (5’-CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3 ’) and 805 R (5’-GAC -
TACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3 ’). Amplicons were sequenced on the Illu-
mina MiSeq platform using 600-cycle MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 (Illumina, 
San Diego, CA, USA). All sequences files were deposited at the National 
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequences Read Archive 
(SRA – http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) under BioProject ID: 
PRJNA1002128. 
2.6. Bioinformatic and statistical data analysis 
Sequencing data of 16S rRNA were processed using Mothur software 
(v.1.43.0). Silva NR database (v.138) was employed to align the repre -
sentative sequences of each operational taxonomic units (OTUs) [62], 
whereas Greengenes database (v.13_8_99) was used for classification 
and taxonomic purposes. OTUs were classified at 97% sequence simi-
larity to detect subgenera. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA), hier-
archical cluster and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) 
analysis of the bacterial community of the consortium C7 based on 
Bray-Curtis distances (at the OTU, genus and specie level respectively) 
and the permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) 
from OTU data were determined using PAST software version 4.13. I. Aguilar-Romero et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Journal of Hazardous Materials 464 (2024) 132970
4Alpha diversity parameters (Chao1, Shannon index and Simpson ’s 
evenness) were also quantified using PAST software. Mean significant 
differences were detected by One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) at a 
significance level of 0.05 using the SPSS statistical software package 
version 25 (IBM Corporation, New York, USA). 
2.7. Isolation and identification of bacterial strains from C7 consortium 
To isolate the IBP-degrading bacterial strains, 100 µL of the con-
sortium C7 after acclimatization were plated on both MSM-agar medium 
as LB-agar medium in presence of IBP (200 mg L-1) and incubated at 30 
•C for 48 h. Thirteen bacterial strains were isolated according to colony 
morphology (size, colour, edge and elevation) and growth capacity on 
MSM-agar medium with IBP as sole carbon source. For their identifi -
cation, total DNA was extracted from 1 mL of pure LB cultures using G- 
spin™ Total DNA Extraction Kit (iNtRON Biotechnology, Inc). These 
bacterial strains were identified by sequencing the 1465 bp-long 16S 
rRNA gene amplification products obtained by PCR using the universal 
oligonucleotide primers 27 F (5-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3) and 
1492 R (5-GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3). Sanger sequencing of the 
amplified products was performed at the STABVIDA laboratory 
(Caparica, Portugal). In addition, primers 518 F (5-CCAG -
CAGCCGCGGTAATACG-3) and 800 R (5-TACCAGGGTATCTAATCC-3) 
were used. The 16S rRNA sequences of isolates were submitted to the 
GenBank database in NCBI under different accession numbers. 
2.8. Biodegradation assays in solution with isolated IBP-degrading 
bacteria 
All bacterial strains isolated from the consortium C7 were inoculated 
at 108 CFU mL-1 under aerobic conditions in triplicated in flasks with 20 
mL of MSM medium spiked with IBP (10 mg L-1) and cultivated at 30 •C 
and 180 rpm for 14 days in presence of glucose (3 g L-1). Non-inoculated 
sterile controls were also prepared to observe any abiotic degradation. 
IBP concentration in solution was determined by HPLC analysis as 
described in Section 2.3. 
2.9. IBP biodegradation experiments in sewage sludge slurry 
To determine the capacity of the consortium C7 to improve IBP 
removal rates in sewage sludge, bioaugmentation assays were per-
formed, but previously adsorption-desorption experiments of IBP on 
sewage sludge were carried out. For that purpose, IBP batch adsorption 
experiments in sewage sludge were carried out in triplicate in Corex 
centrifuge tubes by mixing 0.1 g of sludge with 10 mL of 0.01 M Ca 
(NO 3)2 solution containing various concentrations (0, 3, 5 and 10 mg L- 
1) of IBP. The samples were shaken for 72 h at 20 ±1 •C (previous ki-
netic studies showed that adsorption equilibrium was reached in less 
than 24 h). IBP adsorbed was calculated from the difference between its 
concentrations in the supernatant before and after equilibrium, and 
adsorption isotherms were obtained by plotting the amount of IBP 
adsorbed (Cs, µmol kg-1) versus the respective concentrations in equi-
librium (Ce, µmol L-1). Sorption isotherm was fitted to the linear equa-
tion Cs Kd x Ce, where Kd is the linear sorption constant. Desorption 
experiments were performed after adsorption equilibrium was reached 
by removing 5 mL of the supernatant (for initial IBP concentrations of 3, 
5 and 10 mg L-1) after centrifugation and replacing it by 5 mL of 0.01 M 
Ca(NO 3)2 solution, allowing equilibration for an additional 24 h, and 
finally operating as in the adsorption experiments. Three consecutive 
desorption steps were carried out. 
IBP biodegradation experiments in sewage sludge were carried out in 
Corex glass centrifuge tubes containing 1 g of sludge which was spiked 
with 1 mL of 10 mg L-1 IBP solution prepared in methanol to obtain an 
initial IBP concentration of 10 mg kg-1. After solvent evaporation, 5 mL 
of MSM medium were added to each tube, which were also inoculated to 
obtain 108 CFU mL-1 of consortium C7. Non-inoculated tubes were run in parallel as a control of the IBP dissipation in sewage sludge in order to 
observe any biodegradative effect of the sludge endogenous microbial 
population. For abiotic controls, sludge was sterilized by autoclaving at 
121 •C for 40 min, and sodium azide was added in the MSM medium at 
an initial concentration of 200 mg L-1 to avoid the biological activity. All 
microcosms were incubated at 30 •C on a rotatory shaker at 150 rpm for 
16 days. The IBP concentration was monitored at 0, 6, 9, 13 and 16 days. 
The centrifuge tubes were freeze-thawed three times to break the cells 
walls and then the samples were centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 20 min. 
The supernatant was discarded after verifying by HPLC the absence of 
IBP in the liquid phase as described in Section 2.3. Then, an exhaustive 
IBP-extraction from the solid phase was performed by adding 5 mL of 
acetonitrile acidified with 1% acetic acid and vortexing for 1 min. 
Samples were supplemented with 2 g of a QuEChERS extraction salts 
mixture (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), vortexed for 1 
min, and centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatants were 
transferred to new vials and 200 mg of PSA (Primary Secondary Amine, 
Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) were added and manually 
shaked. After 24 h decantation, 1 mL aliquots were filtered through a 
0.45 µm PTFE filters and analyzed by HPLC analyser coupled to an 
UV–vis detector (LC-2010AHT, Shimadzu), with a C-18 column (4 ×150 
mm) and acetonitrile:water (50:50) as mobile phase (pH 3 with ortho -
phosphoric acid), at a flow rate of 1.2 mL min-1. The detection wave -
length was 210 nm, the injection volume was 25 µL and the detection 
limit was 0.05 mg L-1 of IBP. 
3.Results and discussion 
3.1. Biodegradation of IBP in solution by the enriched consortium C7 
After seven enrichment cultures an efficient and stable IBP- 
degrading consortium was successfully obtained. An acclimatization 
period of three days was necessary to begin IBP degradation and the 
growth of the consortium biomass with IBP as the sole carbon source, 
removing 100% of 500 mg L-1 in six days (Fig. 1), and increasing the 
growth of the consortium from an optical density OD600 nm of 0.1–0.5. It 
indicated that C7 consortium is composed of a microbial population 
capable of degrading (and probably mineralizing) IBP, and, therefore, its 
potential application for its removal from water and sewage sludge. A 
similar experiment was carried out but using glucose as an additional 
carbon source to observe if the kinetic of IBP degradation could be 
reduced, but IBP degradation was completely inhibited, indicating that 
microorganism of the consortium preferentially select such easily 
degradable carbon source. 
In order to reduce the time of IBP degradation by consortium C7, the 
rest of assays were carried out using cells from the acclimatized culture 
harvested after 7 days (when no IBP was detected), and no acclimati -
zation period was observed, as shown in Fig. 2 where different IBP 
concentrations (1–1000 mgL-1) were proved at pH 7 and 30•C.

5Biodegradation curves of the control samples remained stable 
throughout the experiment (data not shown) and the abiotic dissipation 
could be considered negligible. For all the concentrations tested, lag 
phases were not perceived and IBP concentration sharply decreased, 
reaching 100% degradation in less than 30, 28, 26, 24 and 6h for the 
concentrations of 1000, 500, 100, 10 and 1mgL-1, respectively. The 
growth of the consortium (OD 600nm) drastically increased from 0.1 till 
0.72 and 0.45 for 1000 and 500mgL-1 IBP, respectively, and only till 
0.15 for 100mgL-1. The increase was not observed for 10 and 1mgL-1. 
It indicated the ability of the consortium C7 to degrade a wide variety of 
IBP concentrations in solution in a very short time, and also that IBP, and 
probably its degradation products, are being used by microorganisms in 
C7 consortium as carbon and energy source. The influence of other 
conditions of temperature and pH on IBP degradation ability of C7 
consortium is shown in Fig. 3. In the range of pH 6–8 (at a temperature 
of 30•C) the rate and efficiency of biodegradation was not affected 
(Fig. 3B). On the contrary, the change in temperature in the range 
among 20•C and 40•C (at pH 7) affected significantly the IBP biodeg -
radation by C7 consortium (Fig. 3A). The most favourable temperature 
was 30•C, with 100% IBP degraded in 28h, in comparison to the 70h necessary to reach the complete IBP biodegradation at 20•C, and the 
null capacity of C7 consortium for biodegradation at 40•C. 
The rapid IBP biodegradation shown by consortium C7 even at very 
high concentrations of this drug (up to 1000 mgL-1 in only 30h) and the 
use of IBP as carbon source for C7 consortium growth (Fig. 1) seems to 
indicate the possible ability of C7 to mineralize IBP. The conditions of 
temperature and pH selected for mineralization experiment were the 
most favourable previously shown: pH 7 and 30•C, and the results are 
shown in Fig. 4. About 66% IBP was mineralized in only 3 days since it 
was the percentage of CO2 produced due to the respiratory process of 
microorganisms present in C7 consortium. Therefore, the use of IBP as 
the only carbon and energy source, generating biomass and CO2, has 
been demonstrated. 
Toxicity measurements using Microtox bioassays were carried out 
throughout the bioremediation process in solution of one of the highest 
IBP concentrations used. It was observed that the initial concentration of 
500mgL-1 in the non-inoculated microcosms at the beginning of the 
process presented acute toxicity (TU 8.87), which was slightly increased 
20h after inoculation (TU 9.70), in spite of presenting an IBP remaining 
concentration of only 68mgL-1 (Fig. 2A). It probably indicates that 
some of the metabolites produced through this process are even more 
toxic than the parent contaminant. However, when IBP was completely 
degraded after 24h, the solution presented no-toxicity (TU 0). 
As previously mentioned, very few studies have been carried out 
using microbial consortia for IBP degradation. Jia et al. [33] and 
Quintelas et al. [64] used activated sludge from WWTPs and observed 
the complete degradation of 1mgL-1 IBP after 36h and 50h, respec -
tively, while the bacterial consortium C7 used in the present study took 
only 6h to degrade the same IBP concentration. In general, the results 
obtained with consortium C7 in the present study are better than most of 
those previously mentioned in the Introduction section using different 
consortia. They only were similar to those of Ferrer-Polonio et al. [26] 
with a degradation of 2mgL-1 IBP in only 5h using activated sludge,

ciency of consortium C7 (A and B) and growth of biomass (C) at pH 7 and 30•C.

6and those of Fortunato et al. [27], with 100mgL-1 IBP degraded in 33h. 
The results obtained by Chen et al. [14] using a bacterial consortium 
from activated sludge after enrichments with IBP were also similar to 
those obtained in the present study, with 50mgL-1 IBP degraded in 
12h. With regard to bacterial consortia prepared with defined bacterial 
strains, the use of Bacillus thuringiensis B1(2015b) Pseudomonas moorei 
KB4 [47] reached a degradation of 5mgL-1 IBP in 24h, similar also to 
the results obtained with consortium C7 in the present study. All these 
results indicated that the consortium C7 had a greater potential than 
most of the consortia published in literature for a real application in IBP 
degradation. 
3.2. Biodegradation of IBP in sewage sludge by the enriched consortium 
C7 
A great part of sewage sludge produced in WWTPs is valorised as 
amendment in agriculture, and according to Lachassagne et al. [37], IBP 
shows a high desorption potential from sludge and high mobility in soils, 
being found in amended soil leachates, with the consequent risk of 
groundwater contamination, and the negative effects for different eco-
systems. Other studies have also demonstrated the low sorption affinity 
of IBP in soils [24,40] . Therefore, one of the objectives of the present 
study was to reduce IBP concentration also in sewage sludge samples. 
Adsorption-desorption isotherms of IBP on the sewage sludge 
selected for its degradation studies were carried out (Fig. 5). IBP 
adsorption was well described by a linear equation and the sorption 
constant Kd obtained was 70.2 Lkg-1, similar to Kd values obtained by 
Abegglen et al. [1] and Urase and Kikuta [77] (D75Lkg-1 and 80Lkg-1, 
respectively), which indicated a weak sorption to the sludge. Yu et al. 
[88] and Horsing et al. [30] also observed a weak sorption of IBP by 
sludge. In contrast to literature reports, in our case the percentage 
desorbed was very low, only about 12–15%, as it can be observed in 
Fig. 5 for initial IBP concentrations of 3, 5 and 10mgL-1. IBP exhibit a 
log Kow (octanol-water coefficient) of 3.97 which was supposed to lead 
to low affinity for the aqueous phase. Sewage sludge under study pre-
sented a high organic matter content (48%) and probably the hydro -
phobic adsorption of IBP on the sludge played a special role in this case, 
but it is clear that desorption ability based on Kow or pKa is not always 
reliable, as previously observed in other studies. Mejías et al. [48] 
observed that one of the pharmaceuticals detected at higher concen -
trations in digested sludge was IBP (up to 4105 ngg-1), but also observed 
that its concentrations significantly differ between studies even up to 
three orders of magnitude. This is mainly related to sludge source, which 
depends on the different human habits, sampling regions or climate 
conditions. 
The next step was to test if the consortium C7 was able to decrease 
the concentration of IBP adsorbed on sewage sludge. As previously mentioned, few studies are available at the moment to eliminate phar-
maceuticals from sewage sludge by using bioaugmentation, and most of 
them used fungus [9,68,69] . As far as we know, only Liu et al. [41] 
studied the biodegradation of gentamicin by the bacterial consortia 
AMQD4, removing about 57% and 48% in unsterilized and sterilized 
sewage, respectively. Fig. 6 shows the percentages of residual IBP in the 
solid phase of the slurry. No IBP was detected in the liquid phase of the 
slurry under the different conditions tested, corroborating the previous 
results obtained of very low percentages of IBP desorbed from the 
sewage sludge selected for this study. 
In general, the mechanisms involved in the removal of pharmaceu -
ticals by microorganisms include biodegradation, bio-sorption, volatil -
ization and hydrolysis [64], but several studies observed that IBP was 
not removed via volatilization and hydrolysis [88]. Therefore, the main 
mechanisms involved in the dissipation of IBP are biodegradation and 
biosorption on sewage sludge. Separation of these processes was ach-
ieved using sodium azide to inhibit the biotic activity, and this assay is 
called “Sterilised Sludge ”. After applying an exhaustive extraction 
method, 100% of IBP adsorbed on the sludge could be extracted after 
different incubation periods, and only after 16 days a lower percentage 
of IBP (80%) was extracted from the sludge, indicating that after longer 
periods a small part of IBP could remain as a bound residue. 
When the sludge was not sterilised (assay called “Sludge ”), a 
continuous but very small decrease of IBP remaining on sludge was 
observed as time increased, indicating that the endogenous microbiota 
of the sludge was capable of degrading IBP despite being strongly 
adsorbed, as previously commented. After 16 incubation days only 
about 30% IBP had been dissipated, with a great part corresponding to 
biosorption and the rest to biodegradation, since, as previously 
mentioned in “Sterilized Sludge ”, about 20% IBP remained bioadsorbed, 
and, therefore, only 10% can be assigned to biodegradation. 
When the sludge was bioaugmented with consortium C7 (“Bio-
augmented Sludge ”) a faster IBP degradation was observed, and after 16 
days around 90% IBP had been removed from the sludge mainly due to 
biodegradation, in spite of the strong adsorption previously observed. It 
demonstrated the suitability of consortium C7 to biodegrade IBP not 
only in solution, but also adsorbed on sewage sludge, even as bound 
residue. As far as we know, no studies have been conducted to date on 
bioaugmentation using bacterial consortia or isolated bacteria for IBP 
degradation in sludge. Therefore, it is important to highlight the appli -
cation significance and the potential environmental impact that this 
novel bioaugmentation technique using consortium C7 isolated from 
sewage sludge could have for its use in a real environment of a WWTP, in 
order to reduce the content of IBP residues both in wastewater and 
sludge.

73.3. Bacterial community structure and composition of the consortium C7 
IBP-degrading consortium C7 was analysed by amplicon sequencing 
of the 16S rRNA gene during acclimatization process at different times 
(0, 4 and 7 days, Fig. 1) to determine changes in the bacterial commu -
nity composition and to identify the main groups of microorganisms 
potentially involved in IBP degradation. 
Alpha diversity indices (Chao1, Shannon and Simpson) of the bac-
terial community in the consortium C7 were analyzed at 0, 4 and 7 days 
to determine the effect of IBP on the diversity and richness of the bac-
terial community during the acclimatization process (Fig. S1 Supporting 
Information ). In general, the values of these parameters increased 
significantly over time (ANOVA, pD0.05). According to Chao1 index, 
the bacterial richness increased in the consortium C7 after four days of 
incubation with IBP as sole carbon and energy source. Similar ten-
dencies were observed in Shannon diversity and Simpson indices, which 
showed significantly higher values at 7 days (ANOVA, pD0.05). The 
tendencies of these parameters indicate that IBP positively affects both 
richness and diversity of the bacterial population during the acclimati -
zation process. With regard to other previous studies, a positive effect on 
bacterial diversity was also observed in batch reactors and water bio-
purification systems treated with IBP, showing the resilience potential of 
bacterial communities exposed to this contaminant [2,34] . 
Hierarchical clustering analysis of the bacterial community in the 
consortium C7 grouped samples according to time (Fig. 7A), with 0-day 
samples clustering more closely with 4-day samples, when 80% of IBP 
still remained in the culture. Similarly, the first principal component 
(PC1) of the principal coordinate analysis (Fig. S2) accounts for 94% of 
statistical variability (PC1) separates 0-day and 4-day samples from 7- 
day samples. As expected, the permutational multivariate analysis of 
variance (PERMANOVA) from operational taxonomic units (OTUs) data 
showed significant differences between these groups (pD0.003), indi-
cating that IBP incubation time affected the bacterial composition of the 
consortium C7. 
The bacterial community of the consortium C7 was integrated by 51 
different OTUs grouped into the phyla Proteobacteria (92.7 –99.9%) , 
Bacteroidetes (0.01 –7.2%) , Actinobacteria (0–0.05%) and Firmicutes 
(0.01%) (Fig. S3). Proteobacteria have been previously described as the 
dominant phylum in activated sludge supplemented with high concen -
trations of IBP [18]. The relative abundance of the most dominant 
genera in the consortium C7 during the acclimatization process at 0, 4 
and 7 days is shown in Fig. 7B. At the genus level, 29 different genera 
were detected, which accounted for 91.6 –99.9% of the total OTUs an-
notated in all samples. Pseudomonas was the most predominant genus at 
the different times followed by Achromobacter , Sphingomonas and Stenotrophomonas . Despite the existence of IBP-degrading bacterial 
strains belonging to the genus Pseudomona s [14,71,83] , the relative 
abundance of this genus was drastically decreased in the consortium C7 
during the acclimatization process (Fig. 7B). The genera Achromobacter 
and Stenotrophomonas also showed lower relative abundance values 
after 7 days of incubation with IBP. In contrast, a 42.5% increase in the 
relative abundance of Sphingomonas occurred during acclimatization 
process (Fig. 7B). Therefore, the genus Sphingomonas could be poten -
tially involved in the disappearance of IBP from the culture medium. 
According to this result, only few studies reported a correlation between 
the Sphingomonas genus and IBP-degradation. Murdoch and Hay [53] 
isolated the bacterial strain Sphingomonas sp. Ibu-2 from activated 
sludge, which was able to use IBP as sole carbon and energy source. 
Moreover, Huang et al. [31] suggested that the detection of sequences 
identical to Sphingomonas sp. could be in charge of IBP biodegradation in 
activated sewage sludge. In a previous study, Sphingomonas -related OTU 
was proposed as a potential biomarker involved in IBP-degradation in 
biopurification systems [2]. 
Increases in the relative abundance of Pseudoxanthomonas , Labrys , 
Pandoraea and Pigmentaphaga were also observed (Fig. 7C), thus sug-
gesting the possible involvement of these genera in IBP dissipation. In 
fact, bacterial species belonging to these genera have been linked to the 
degradation of several non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [42,50, 
80]. 
In order to elucidate the specific taxa potentially involved in IBP 
degradation, the different bacterial species comprising the consortium 
C7 were analysed during the acclimatization process (Fig. 8). Fifteen 
bacterial species were detected in the consortium C7. When NMDS 
ordination was constrained with data of the detected bacterial species 
(Fig. 8A), Sphingomonas wittichii , Bordetella petrii, Pseudomonas stutzeri 
and Bosea genosp . showed more influence at 7 days when no IBP was 
detected in the culture medium, indicating that these species could be 
potential IBP-degraders. Previously, these bacterial species have been 
related with an effective removal of several recalcitrant compounds. 
Bordetella petrii was identified in the bacterial community established in 
an immobilized cell biofilter with a high effectiveness to depurate 
diclofenac from wastewater [55]. On the other hand, Pseudomonas 
stutzeri was detected in biopurification systems exposed to IBP and 
considered an interesting biomarker for studying IBP degradation [2]. 
The bacterial strain P. stutzeri CSW02 has been also described as an 
efficient paracetamol degrader [78]. Recently, Aulestia et al. [7] re-
ported the bacterial strain Sphingomonas wittichii MPO218 isolated from 
activated sludge with the capacity to growth with IBP as a sole carbon 
and energy source. In the current study, although Pseudomonas nitro-
reducens was the most dominant bacterial specie in the consortium C7 at 
Fig. 6.Percentages of residual ibuprofen in sewage sludge (initial concentration 10mgkg-1) at different conditions: sludge and sterilized sludge (both non- 
inoculated with consortium C7) and sludge bioaugmented with consortium C7. Error bars indicate standard deviation. I. Aguilar-Romero et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Journal of Hazardous Materials 464 (2024) 132970
8initial time (Fig. 8B), a strong enrichment of S. wittichii was observed 
after 7 days, which relative abundance increased from 0-0.03% to 
40.8 –43.4%. Thus, these results highlight S. wittichii as the main bac-
terial specie in the consortium C7 responsible for IBP degradation. This 
is reinforced by the fact that IBP mineralization by C7 consortium has 
been observed, and the conclusion reached by various researchers that 
the complete mineralization of IBP is limited to the family of the 
Sphingomonadaceae , the same as S. wittichii , when present as sole carbon 
and energy source. IBP exposure also caused an initial positive effect on 
Stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila , increasing its relative abundance to 
5.3% after 4 days of incubation (Fig. 8B), and suggesting the possible 
involvement of S. acidaminiphila in the dissipation of IBP. Interestingly, 
several bacterial species belonging to the genus Stenotrophomonas have been reported as degrading microorganisms of other non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs such as naproxen and diclofenac [59,85] . 
However, the relative abundance of S. acidaminiphila decreased again 
2.9 times at 7 days. This could be due to the presence of other degrading 
strains in the consortium C7 that remove IBP more efficiently from the 
culture medium, thus decreasing or avoiding the proliferation of 
S. acidaminiphila at 7 days.

10bioremediation processes was carried out through the enrichment cul-
ture using IBP as the only carbon and energy source. Thirteen bacterial 
strains were isolated from C7 consortium (Table 1), belonging three of 
them to the class Alfaproteobacteria (Brucella tritici CSW06, Labrys 
neptuniae CSW11, Shinella zoogloeoides CSW12), two of them to Beta-
proteobacteria (Bordetella petrii CSW07, Achromobacter denitrificans 
CSW15), 6 belonged to the class Gammaproteobacteria (Steno -
trophomonas acidaminiphila CSW10, Pseudomonas nitroreducens CSW13, 
and 4 of them Pseudomonas citronellolis CSW09, CSW14, CSW16, 
CSW17), and two to Actinomycetia (Microbacterium paraoxydans CSW08 
and Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens CSW18). Their accession numbers in 
the NCBI database and the percentage of similarity with the closest 
match of the 16s rRNA gene sequences are also shown in Table 1. 
IBP biodegradation in aqueous solution by bacteria isolated from C7 
consortium after 14 days ’ incubation was carried out using 10mgL-1 
IBP as monosubstrate. Only L. Neptuniae was able to degrade IBP 
reaching an extent of degradation about 26%. IBP degradation by the 
rest of bacterial strains was similar to that obtained in the non- 
inoculated systems. To study the possibility of cometabolic degrada -
tion of these bacterial strains glucose was used as external carbon 
source. Environmental significance of cometabolism lies in the capacity 
of conversion of the target organic pollutant (which does not support 
growth) to products that accumulate and often are toxic products. 
However, when a second substrate used as C and energy sources is 
added, this will provoke an increase in the degradation rate of the target 
organic pollutant by cometabolism, due to a biomass increase and the 
generation of enzymes or cofactors required for its transformation [38, 
52]. Fig. 9 shows the percentage of IBP degraded with the following 
decreasing order: 100%, L. neptuniae ; 58%, M. paraoxydans ; 45%, 
A. denitrificans ; 33%, P. citronellolis ; 26%, B. tritici , and the rest of strains 
degraded ≼20%. It indicated that an effective degradation of IBP occurs 
by cometabolism with glucose by some bacterial strains that had not 
been previously described as IBP-degraders. Interestingly, several of the 
isolated bacterial strains belong to the genera Labrys, Achromobacter and 
Stenotrophomonas , whose relative abundance was positively affected at 
different times during the acclimatization process (Fig. 7C). On the other 
hand, although Bordetella petrii showed greater influence at 7 days in the 
NMDS analysis (Fig. 8A), the bacterial strain B. petrii CSW07 only 
degraded 19.4% of IBP after 14 days (Fig. 9), which could suggest the 
need of other degrading bacteria to completely eliminate IBP. In fact, a 
bacterial consortium consisting of two Bordetella petrii strains and Ach-
romobacter xyloxidans was related to the biodegradation of pesticides 
[17]. 
As far as we know, except P. citronellolis and M. paraoxydans , none of the other bacterial strains isolated in the present study have been pre-
viously described as IBP degraders. Very rencently, Wittich et al. [83] 
observed that P. citronellolis degraded IBP (but only acting as a con-
sortium of three P. citronellolis (RW422, RW423, RW 424). Other pseu-
domonas has been recently proved to degrade IBP: Pseudomonas sp. M20 
[14]. Show et al. [74] also observed that M. paraoxydans increased IBP 
degradation in the presence of yeast, although no other Microbacterium 
had been described for that purpose. 
On the contrary, L. neptuniae , has not been described previously as 
IBP degrader, although the species L. portucalensis F11 has been 
demonstrated to degrade a wide variety of pharmaceutical products, 
such as ofloxacin, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin [5], fluoxetine [49], 
diclofenac [50], or carbamazepine [12]. Something similar occurs with 
S. zoogloeoides and P. nitroreducens , which have not been described as 
IBP degraders, but strains isolated from WWTP sludge were shown to 
degrade the synthetic oestrogen 17α-ethinylestradiol [57] and fluoxe -
tine [58]. Achromobacter denitrificans PR1 has also not been described as 
IBP degrader, but improved the removal of sulfonamides group phar-
maceuticals [56,67,66] . On the contrary, as far as we know, in the cases 
of B. tritici, B. petri, S. acidaminiphila and C. flaccumfaciens there is no 
information as IBP degraders, and even the respective genus Brucella, 
Bordetella, Stenotrophomonas or Curtobacterium have not been described 
either. 
4.Conclusions 
The biodegradation in solution of a wide variety of IBP concentra -
tions (1–1000 mgL-1) by consortium C7 was carried out, reaching 100% 
degradation between 6h and 30h. The capacity of C7 for IBP miner -
alization (about 66% in 3 days) was also demonstrated. C7 shows 
greater potential for IBU degradation than most of the others consortia 
previously studied. Moreover, when IBP is adsorbed on sewage sludge, 
inoculation with C7 produced the biodegradation of 90% IBP, in com-
parison to 30% dissipated in the non-bioaugmented sludge. All these 
data indicated the high capacity of consortium C7 for not only biode -
grade but also mineralize IBP, even strongly adsorbed on sewage sludge. 
Bacterial community of consortium C7 suffered a shift after IBP 
degradation. The genera Sphingomonas increased drastically, being 
potentially involved in IBP degradation and mineralization. The relative 
abundance of the genera Pseudoxanthomonas , Labrys , Pandoraea and 
Pigmentaphaga also increased. Fifteen bacterial species were detected in 
the consortium C7, but the relative abundance of Sphingomonas wittichii 
increased drastically (from 0 to F40%) when IBP was completely 
degraded, indicating that it is the main bacterial specie responsible for 
IBP degradation. 
Bacterial strains with the ability to grow in the presence of IBP were 
isolated from C7: B. tritici, L. neptuniae, S. zoogloeoides, B. petrii, A. 
denitrificans, S. acidaminiphila, P. nitroreducens, P. citronellolis, M. para-
oxydans, and C. flaccumfaciens . Only L. neptuniae was able to degrade IBP 
as monosubstrate, but when glucose was present all of them showed IBP 
degradation, being the most effective L. neptuniae . Except P. citronellolis 
and M. paraoxydans , it is the first time that the other 8 bacterial strains 
are described as IBP degraders. 
Environmental Implication 
The wide use of ibuprofen (IBP) involves ecological risks, being 
considered an emerging pollutant. IBP excreted by humans ends up in 
WWTPs, but partially remains not only in the effluent waters used for 
irrigation but also in sewage sludge used as fertilizer. WWTPs is the 
unique opportunity to remove IBP from both matrices before its 
dispersion in the environment. Consortium C7 isolated from sewage 
sludge reached an IBP degradation higher than other IBP-degrading 
consortia in aqueous solution and, for the first time, in sewage sludge. 
Bacterial community changes were studied and new effective IBP- 
degrading bacteria were also isolated.
