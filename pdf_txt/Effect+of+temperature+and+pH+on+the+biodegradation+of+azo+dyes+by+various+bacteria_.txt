ABSTRACT : The effect of pH and some nutrients starvation on biodegradation of azo dyes (Orange II and Direct 
Blue 71) by Pseudomonas sp. was investigated. Highest percentage decol ourization values of 56.50% and 45.20% were 
obtained at pH 7.0 and 6.5 for Orange II and Direct Blue 71 respectively. Rate  of decolourization decreased with 
increasing concentration of nitrate (sodium nitrate) or sulphate (magnesium sulpha te heptahydrate).  Highest percentage 
decolourization (79.29% for Orange II a nd 72.38% for Direct Blue 71) was obtai ned in positive controls (no nitrate 
added).  Corresponding values for sulpha te-limited conditions were 76.50% for Or ange II and 78.24% for Direct Blue 
71 in positive controls (no sulphate added).  The nitrogen of  the generated aromatic amines provided the sole source of 
nitrogen in positive controls. Desulphonation of the aromatic moiety provided the sole source of sulphur in the positive 
control medium. The study shows that detoxification of eco systems contaminated with azo  dyes are enhanced under 
nitrate and sulphate-limited conditions. @JASEM 
 
Dyes are extensively used in the textile, paper, food, 
cosmetics and pharmaceuti cal industries (Chen et al., 
1999). Azo dyes are poorly biodegradable because of their structure (Kim and Shoda, 1999) and, though 
they represent a potentially important class of organic 
pollutants, little is known about their fate (Chivukula and Renganathan, 1995). Treatment of dye 
wastewater involves physical/chemical methods 
(coagulation, precipitation, adsorption by activated charcoal, oxidation by ozone, ionizing radiation and 
ultrafilteration). These met hods are not only costly 
but also generates wastes which are difficult to dispose of, are less efficient and of limited 
application (Chen et al., 1999). 
 Microbial degradation of azo dyes has been 
reported:  Proteus  mirabilis (Chen et al ., 1999); 
Pseudomonas sp. (Oranusi & Ogugbue, 2001) 
Actinobacillus succinogens (Park et al .,1999);  
Pseudomonas luteola (Hu,1998) and Mycobacterium 
avium  (Jones et al. , 2003). Under anaerobic or 
microaerophilic conditions, az o dyes are degraded to 
aromatic amines by the enzyme azoreductase 
secreted by microorganisms (Plumb et al.,2001; Yoo 
et al.,  2001).  These aromatic amines are toxic, 
mutagenic and carcinogenic (Bell et al ., 2000) and 
are a potential source of c oncern in the environment. 
Under aerobic conditions, the aromatic amines are 
metabolised further, th erefore, completing the 
detoxification of aromatic amines.   Biodegradation of pollutants in natural 
ecosystems is influenced by various environmental 
factors including pH, temperature, salinity, cations, anions, biochemical oxygen demand, chemical 
oxygen demand and oxygen  (Ganesh et al.,  1994). 
Biodegradation of dyes has been monitored using 
various indices:  decolourisation (Chen et al.,  1999; 
Oranusi and Ogugbue, 2001); total viable count (Oranusi and Ogugbue, 2001) and mineralisation 
(Blumel et al.,  1998). 
 In this study, we investigated the effect of 
pH and nutrient (nitrate and sulphate) starvation on biodegradation (decolourisation) of azo dyes (Orange 
II and Direct Blue 71) by Pseudomonas  sp. under 
aerobic conditions.   
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Dyes:   Orange II and Direct Blue 71 (Aldrich 
Chemical Co., U.S.A.) were used at their commercially available dye content of 90% and 50% 
respectively.  Stock solution of each dye was 
prepared by dissolving 2.0 g of each dye in 100 ml-deionised water (20 mg ml
-1) and sterilized by 
membrane filtration (0.20 μm pore size Acrodisc).  
Fig. 1 shows the structure of the dyes. 
 Organism: Pseudomonas  sp. was isolated as 
previously described (Oranusi and Ogugbue, 2001) 
by selective enrichment in batch culture to growth in Orange II and Direct Blue 71 as sole sources of 
carbon and energy. Standard inoculums (ca. 10
6 
CFUml-1) was prepared by subculturing from the 
stock culture into 10ml nutrient broth and incubated 
at 30±20C for 24h. 
 
Media:  Three types of media were used: Medium 1 
contained (gL-1); NaCl 4.0, MgSO 4. 7H 2O O.42, KCl 
0.29, K 2HPO 4 1.27, KH 2PO 4 0.85, NaNO 3 0.42, 
EDTA 0.5ml and deionised water 1,000ml. Medium 2 was same as medium 1 but contained various 
concentrations of nitrate (sodium nitrate).  
Medium 3 was same as Medium 1 but contained various concentrations of MgSO
4. 7H 2O and without 
sodium nitrate.   All media were sterilized by 
autoclaving at 1210C for 15 min. and 15psi.  After 
sterilization and cooling, five milliliters of Orange II 
or one milliliter of Direct Blue 71 were added to each 
of M 1, M 2 or M 3 medium.  Media, which contained 
Orange II, were designated M 1O, M 2O or M 3O while, 
media, which contained Direct Blue 71, were 
designated M 1D, M 2D or M 3D.JASEM ISSN 1119-8362

Effect of pH:   The pH of each of media M
1O and 
M1D were adjusted to various pH values: 5.0, 5.5, 
6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5 and 8.0. In order to ensure that decolourisation was not a function of pH change, the 
effect of pH on the visi ble absorption was assayed 
between pH 4.5 to 8.5 at λmax for each dye.  The 
visible absorption spectra of the dyes were not 
affected at pH values from 5.0 to 8.0 .  Slight 
increase was observed at pH 8.5 and decrease at pH 
4.5.  These pH values were, therefore, not included in this study.  Each of M
1O or M 1D medium was 
dispensed in 90ml amounts into duplicate set of 
250ml Erlenmeyer flask and inoculated with 10ml of standard inoculum. Each pH value had duplicate set 
of uninoculated control flasks. Cultures and control 
flasks were incubated at 30 ±2
0C with shaking at 
100rev. min.-1.  Samples were withdrawn on zero day 
and every 2- days for determination of pH and optical 
density of culture supernatant (decolourisation). The 
optimum pH for decolourisation of Orange II was pH 7.0 and pH 6.5 for Direct Blue 71.  The pH of media 
for subsequent experiment was adjusted to these 
optimal. 
   
Effect of various concentrations of nitrate:  The pH 
of M 2O and M 2D media were adjusted to optimal 
value for decolourisation (pH 7.0 for Orange II and 6.5 for Direct Blue  71).  Into each of duplicate set of 
250ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 90ml of M
2O or 
M2D medium was added various concentrations (g ) 
of sodium nitrate (0.01, 0.03, 0.04, 0.06,0.08, 0.10).  
Positive controls consisted of duplicate set of flasks 
without sodium nitrate.  These flasks were each inoculated with 10ml of standard inoculum.  
Negative controls consisted of duplicate flasks for 
each concentration but were uninoculated. Incubation 
was at 30 ±20C with shaking at 100 rev. min.-1 . 
Samples were withdrawn on zero day and at two-day intervals for determination of pH and optical density 
of culture supernatant (decolourisation). The highest dye decolourisation was obtained in M
2O and M 2D 
media without nitrate (i.e. positive controls).  
Subsequent studies were carried out without nitrate addition. 
Effect of various concentrations of sulphate:  Into 
each of duplicate set of 250ml Erlenmeyer flasks which contained 90ml of either M
3O or M 3D medium 
(pH = 7.0 for Orange II or pH 6.5 for Direct Blue 71 
and without nitrate) was added various concentrations ( g ) of magnesium sulphate 
heptahydrate (0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08).  Positive 
control consisted of duplicate set of flasks in which 
was added 0.04g of magnesium chloride heptahydrate 
to provide the Mg
2+ requirement.  The flasks were 
each inoculated with 10m1 of standard inoculum.  
Uninoculated duplicate set of flasks for each 
concentration were set up as negative controls.  Incubation was at 30+
20C with shaking at 100 rev. 
min.–1. Samples were withdrawn on zero day and at 
2-day intervals for determination of pH and optical density of culture supernatant (decolourisation).  
 
Determination of Optical Density (OD):  Two 
millilitres were aseptically  withdrawn from  each  
flask and pooled (4m1).  Centrifugation was at 
6,000rpm for 30min. in a bench centrifuge (Baird and N N NaO  3 S OH

withdrawn. Supernatant from Orange II grown 
cultures were designated S1 while, S2  was for Direct 
Blue 71 cultures.  The cell pellets for each sample was suspended in physiological saline, mixed 
thoroughly and centrifuged as above.  The resulting 
supernatant was designated S3. The optical density of 
various supernatants was determined 
spectrophotometrically with spectrophotometer 6110 
(Jenway, United Kingdom) at λmax for each dye 
(380nm for Orange II and 330nm for Direct Blue 71).  
Percentage dye decolourisation (DD) was calculated:

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Effect of pH : Maximum percentage decolourisation 
(56.50% Orange II and 45.20% Direct Blue 71) was 
obtained at optimal pH of 7.00 and 6.50 for Orange II and Direct Blue 71 respect ively (Fig. 2). On either 
side of pH optimal, percentage decolourisation 
decreased as the pH increased to acidic or alkaline range. Reductive cleavage of azo bond (-N=N-) in 
azo dyes generates colourless aromatic amines 
(Ganesh et al.,  1994).  The incr ease in pH towards 
the alkaline range with time (Tables 1 and 2) may be 
attributed to the accumulation of these basic aromatic amines and/or other metabolites.

Effect of various concentrations of nitrate :  Figs. 3 
shows the percentage decolourisation in nitrogen – 
sufficient and nitrogen – limited cultures which 
contained Orange II and Direct Blue 71 respectively.  In both cases, percentage dye decolourisation 
decreased with increasing c oncentration of nitrate.  
Maximum percentage decolourisation (79.29% for Orange II and 72.38% for Direct Blue 71) was 
obtained in media without added nitrate (positive 
control).   
 
Maximum percentage decolour isation for each nitrate 
concentration was higher in Orange II containing M
2O medium than in Direct Blue 71-containing M 2D 
medium. For example, at 0.01g, decolourisation was 
74.84% for Orange II and 71.54% for Direct Blue and, 48.88% and 23.75% for Orange II and Direct Blue 71 respectively for medium which contained 
1.0g nitrate.  The results may be attributed to the 
number of azo bonds.  Orange II is a monoazo dye 
while, Direct Blue 71 is a triazo dye (Fig.1). The cleavage of the single azo bond in Orange II will be 
faster than in Direct Blue 71 with triple azo bond.  In 
positive control culture (no nitrate), the aromatic amines resulting from cleavage of azo bond were 
metabolised further to provide the nitrogen 
requirement of the organism.  This will result in detoxification of these toxic, mutagenic and 
carcinogenic amines.  With alternative nitrogen 
source as in cultures with added nitrate, the organism  preferentially metabolised the inorganic nitrogen 
source (nitrate), until the medium became nitrogen–
limited.  This may partially explain the decreasing Effect of pH…

 Effect of various concentrations of sulphate :  
Decolourisation was faster in positive control 
cultures (no sulphate  added) than in cultures that contained magnesium sulphate heptahydrate as 
shown in Figs.4 for Orange II and Direct Blue 71. 
Highest percentage decolourization (76.50% for 
Orange II and 78.24% for Direct Blue 71) was 
obtained in cultures without sulphate. In   the cultures with added sulphate, decolourisation rate decreased 
with increasing sulphate co ncentration.  For example, percentage decolourisation was 64.44% (0.02g), 
60.50% (0.04g), 42.85%(0.06g) and 41.45% (0.08g) 
for Orange II grown cultures.  For Direct Blue 71 
grown cultures, the values were 76.25% (0.02g); 70.29% (0.04g); 66.94% (0.06g) and 61.25%% 
(0.08g).   
Desulphonation of the sulphonate group of the dyes provided the sulphur requirement in cultures without 
sulphate.  
 Sulphate is used in some dying processes to enhance exhaustion of dyes.  Ganesh et al.  (1994) 
reported that decolourisation of Navy 106 and 
Reactive Black 5 dyes was inhibited in sulphate- 
sufficient conditions. 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
The results (Fig.4) show that decolourisation of these dyes was enhanced in sulphate-deficiency conditions. 
In all the negative controls (pH, nitrate and sulphate 
experiments), no decolourisation was observed.  These results confirm that decolourisation was as a 
result of metabolic activities of the organism and not 
due to abiotic factors. Desulphonation of the aromatic moiety of the dye molecule coupled with reductive 
cleavage of the azo bond will prohibit aromatic 
amine formation, thereby, detoxifying the aromatic amines. Adsorption of dye molecules has been 
implicated in decolourisa tion of dyes in microbial 
cultures (Yuxin and Jian, 199 8).  The optical density 
of S3 supernatant was below detectable level 
(<0.001). This confirms that decolourisation in this 
study was not due to ad sorption on cell surface. 
Ecosystems are dynamic environments with 
fluctuations in various environmental factors.  This 
study has demonstrated the potential of the bacterium 
(Pseudomonas  sp.) in bioremediation of dye-
contaminated ecosystems subjected to fluctuations in pH, nitrate and sulphate concentrations. Currently,
