Abstract
A bacterium identified as Rhizobium radiobacter MTCC 8161 was isolated from effluent treatment plant of textile and
dying industry of Ichalkaranji, India. The bacterial isolate Rhizobium radiobacter MTCC 8161 was capable of decolo-
rizing various azo, triphenylmethane (TPM), disperse and reactive textile dyes with decolorizing efficiency varyingfrom 80–95%. This strain decolorized (90%) a deep red sulfonated diazo dye Reactive Red 141 (50 mg/L ) with 0.807mg of dye reduced/g of dry cells/h of specific decolorization rate in static anoxic condition at optimum pH 7.0 and tem-perature 30 °C with 83.33% reduction in COD. The degradation efficiency of this strain using urea and yeast extractshowed fast decolorization among different carbon, nitrogen source. The induction of various oxidative and reductiveenzymes indicates involvement of these enzymes in color removal. Phytotoxicity studies revealed less toxic nature ofdecolorized products (1000 mg /L) as compared to original dye. FTIR spectroscopy and GC–MS analysis indicatednaphthalene diazonium, p-dinitrobenzene and 2- nitroso naphthol as the final products of Reactive Red 141.
Keywords : Isolation, Sulfonated diazo dye, Biodegradation, Rhizobium radiobacter , Phytotoxicity and GC-MS.
1. Introduction
More than 50% azo dyes are used annually, due to
simple diazotization reaction mechanism for the produc-tion. Around 2000 of them are used in the textile, leather,plastics, paper, cosmetics and foods industries.
1–2Azo
dyes are characterized by the presence of one or more azogroups substituted with aromatic amines. A substituentoften found in azo dyes is the sulfonic acid group(–SO
3H). The azo dyes containing this substituent are
called as sulfonated azo dyes. Sulfonated azo dyes arewidely used in the different industries. The fixation rateof these reactive dyes (including azo dyes) in dying is aslow as 50%,
3which results the release of 10–15% water
soluble azo dyes into the environment through wastewa-ter discharge.
4Sulfonated and unsulfonated azo dyes ha-
ve a negative aesthetic effect on the wastewater and someof these compounds and biodegraded products are toxic,carcinogenic and mutagenic.
5Azo dyes have large num-
ber of structural diversity and they are designed to resistthe physical, chemical and microbial attack.
6Currentlyvarious chemical, physical and biological treatment met-
hods are used to remove the color. Because of the highcost and disposal problems, most of the chemical andphysical methods for treating dye wastewater are not wi-dely applied in the textile industries.
7The ecofriendly mi-
crobial decolorization and detoxification is a cost compe-titive alternative to the physical and chemical methods.
8
Early work on biodegradation was more focused on ananaerobic conditions;
9hence the sequential anaerobic
and aerobic bacterial degradation system is efficient indegradation of the sulfonated azo dyes.
10Recently, degra-
dation of benzidine based azo dye by Pseudomonas de-
smolyticum NCIM 211211and unidentified bacterial con-
sortium12had been reported at static anoxic condition.
The literature information about the kinetics of decolori-zation and the environmental factors affecting the decolo-rization rates is relatively scarce. Monoazo dye decolori-zation has been reported to follow first-order kineticswith respect to dye concentration by several authors,
13–14
whereas other reports mention zero-order15–16or even
half-order kinetics.17Biodegradation of azo dyes is main-
ly biological process, either enzymatically catalyzed321 Acta Chim. Slov. 2008, 55, 320–329

peroxidase, laccase, and other oxidases) and reductiveenzymes
20(azo reductase and nonspecific reductases) or
the reaction with enzymatically reduced electron car-riers.
21 The involvement of nonspecific reductases (MG
reductase and DCIP reductase) in decolorization of texiledyes was reported earlier.
11
In this piece of work, we report the isolation and
characterization of bacterial isolate capable of decolori-zing Reactive Red 141 azo dye in static anoxic conditionand also the enzymes (lignin peroxidase, azoreductase,dichlorophenol endophenol reductase, MG reductase andaminopyrine N-demethylase) responsible for biodegrada-
tion of Reactive Red 141. The objective of this work is toinvestigate the potential of R. radiobacter , decolorization
kinetics, degradation metabolites of dyes and fate of toxi-city of dye and its degraded metabolites.
2. Experimental
2. 1. Dyestuff, Chemicals and 
Microbiological Media 
All the chemicals were of highest purity and of
analytical grade. The textile dye Reactive Red 14122
(Procion Red HE7B) obtained from local industry of Ic-halkaranji, India. ABTS (2, 2’ – Azinobis, 3-ethylbenzot-hiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) and tartaric acid were obtai-ned from Sigma Chemicals Company (St. Louis, MO,USA) and BDH Chemicals (Mumbai, India) n-propanol,catechol and other fine chemicals were from SRL Che-micals, India.
2. 2. Isolation, Screening and Identification 
of Microorganism
The microorganisms present in the soil samples
from the effluent disposal site of a textile-dyeing industrylocated in Ichalkaranji, India were enriched in the nutrientbroth containing various textile dyes (50 mg of the dye/L)in static anoxic condition at 30 °C. After 48 h of incuba-tion the 1 mL of cell suspension was transferred into freshdye containing broth to screen the strain having color re-moving ability. The screening procedure in liquid mediumwas continued until decolorization of the broth. A smallamount of decolorized broth was transferred into nutrientagar plates containing various textile dyes (50 mg/L). Co-lonies surrounded by decolorized zones were selected andisolated by streak plate method. Isolates were then scree-ned for their color removal ability in liquid medium andthe best isolate was selected. The bacterial isolate was firstexamined by gram staining and further identification wasdone by Microbial Type Culture Collection and GeneBank (MTCC), Institute of Microbial Technology, Chan-digarh, India.2. 3. Strain, Media and Culture Condition
The pure culture of bacterial isolate was grown at 30
°C in static anoxic condition and maintained on nutrientagar slant at 4 °C. Decolorization experiment was carriedout in nutrient broth (0.5% NaCl, 1% peptone, 0.2% yeastextract, 0.1% beef extract). Bushnell and Hass medium(g/L: MgSO
4, 0.2; K2HPO4,1.0; CaCl2, 0.02; FeCl3, 0.05;
NH4NO3, 1.0; supplemented with yeast extract, 0.05 and
Reactive Red 141 (50 mg/L) was used to study the effectof carbon and nitrogen source on decolorization of Reacti-ve Red 141. The different carbon and nitrogen sources(0.5%) such as glucose, mannitol, sucrose, starch, sodiumcitrate, peptone, yeast extract, urea, ammonium chloride,and ammonium acetate were used in the present study.
2. 4 Decolorization Experiments
2. 4. 1. Decolorization at Static and Shaking 
Conditions
Decolorization ability of bacterial isolate was tested in
shaking and static culture at optimum pH (7.0) and tempera-ture (30 °C). A loopful of bacterial culture was inoculated in250 mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 100 mL nutrient brothand grown in static anoxic or shaking (120 rpm) conditionsat 30 °C temperature. After 24 h, 50 mg/L of dye was addedin each flask and incubated in static as well as shaking con-dition. Aliquots (3 mL) of the culture media were drawn at aregular time intervals and the suspended particles were re-moved by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 15 minutes. Thesupernatant was used for the analysis of COD and decolori-zation. Decolorization was monitored by measuring the ab-sorbance at 530 nm using Hitachi U-2800 Spectrophotome-ter and chemical oxygen demand (COD) was determinedaccording to standard method.
23The cell concentration was
determined by attenuance (OD) of culture at 620 nm(OD
620). The relation between bacterial cell concentration
and OD620was 1.0 OD620= 1.818 g dry cell weight/L. Bush-
nell and Hass medium was used to study the effect of vari-ous carbon and nitrogen sources on the decolorization ofReactive Red 141 in static anoxic condition at 30 °C.
2. 4. 2. Decolorization With Increased Dye
and Inoculum Concentration
The various concentrations of dye (100, 200, 300,
400, and 500 mg/L) and inoculum (5, 10, 15, 20 and 25%)were added into the nutrient medium in order to examinethe effect of initial dye and inoculum concentration on thedecolorization in static anoxic condition. Percent decolo-rization and dry cell weight at different time intervals we-re measured. The correlation between the specific decolo-rization rate and dye concentration can be described byMichaelis Menten kinetics ( v
dye= vdye,max [Dye]/ K+ [D-
ye]); where vdye maxand Kmdenoted maximum decoloriza-
tion rate and Michaelis Menten constant and [Dye]repre-
sents the concentration of Reactive Red 141(mg/L).24The fed batch decolorization of Reactive Red 141
dye was also studied, in this study 50 mg/L dye was addedinto the 24 h grown culture (100 mL nutrient broth) ofbacterial isolate, after decolorization 50 mg/L dye addedinto the decolorized broth without supplement of additio-nal nutrient. Dye was added continuously until culturedoes not lose decolorization ability. All decolorization ex-periments were performed in three sets. Abiotic (withoutmicroorganism) controls were always included. The dyeconcentration was determined by monitoring the absor-bance of dye at 530 nm. The percent decolorization wasdetermined by procedure reported earlier.

2. 5. Enzyme Assays
2. 5. 1. Preparation of Cell Free Extract
The 24 h grown cells of bacterial isolate were harve-
sted by centrifugation (7000 rpm, 20 minutes) and sus-pended in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4)and sonicated (5.0 second, 50 amplitude, 7 strokes) at 4°C. The sonicated cells were centrifuged and the superna-tant was used as source of enzyme.
2. 5. 2. Enzyme Assay
All the enzymatic activities were assayed in cell free
extract as well as cultural supernatant. Lignin peroxidase(LiP) assay was performed by procedure reported earlier.
26
One unit of enzyme activity corresponds to change in 0.1 Uof absorbance /minute. Enzyme activity was expressed asunits of enzyme/minute/mg of protein. Aminopyrine N-de-
methylase and NADH–DCIP reductase activity was deter-mined using a procedure reported earlier.
27The malachite
green (MG) reductase assay was carried out using procedu-re reported earlier.
28Azoreductase assay mixture contained
the 4.45 µM of methyl red (MR) and 100 µM NADH in 50mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and 0.1 mL of enzyme solu-tion. This reaction mixture was pre-incubated for 4 minutesfollowed by the addition of NADH and monitored for thedecrease in color absorbance (430 nm) at room temperature.Azoreductase activity was expressed in terms of MR reduc-tion which was calculated by using molar absorption coeffi-cient of 0.023 µM
–1 cm–1 at 430 nm.29All enzyme assays we-
re run in triplicate and average rates were calculated.
2. 6. Extraction and Analysis 
of Biodegraded Product
After 48 h of decolorization, the entire decolorized
medium was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 20 minutes. Su-pernatant of dye decolorized components were extractedusing equal volume of ethyl acetate, dried over anhy-drous Na
2SO4and concentrated in a rotary vacuum eva-
porator. The decolorization was monitored by Uv-visspectrophotometer (Hitachi U-2800). The biodegradationwas analyzed by TLC, HPLC and FTIR spectroscopy.HPLC analysis was carried out (Waters model no. 2690)
on C
18column (symmetry, 4.6 × 250 mm) by isocratic
method with 10 minutes run time.11The mobile phase
was methanol with flow rate of 0.75 mL/minute and Uvdetector at 370 nm. Biodegradation of Reactive Red 141was characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spec-troscopy (Perkin Elmer, Spectrum one) and comparedwith control dye. FTIR analysis was done in the mid IRregion of 400–4000 per cm with 16 scan speed. The pel-lets prepared using spectroscopic pure KBr (5 : 95), werefixed in sample holder and analyses were carried out. Ro-tary vacuum concentrated sample was dissolved in met-hanol and GC-MS analysis of metabolites was carried outusing a QP 5000 mass spectrophotometer (Shimadzu).The ionization voltage was 70 ev. Gas chromatographywas conducted in temperature programming mode with aResteck column (0.25 mm × 30 mm; XTI-5). The initialcolumn temperature was 40 °C for 4 minutes, then in-creased linearly at 10 °C per minute to 270 °C and held at4 minutes. The temperature of injection port was 275 °Cand GC/MS interface was maintained at 300 °C. The he-lium was carrier gas; flow rate was 1 mL per minute and30 minutes run time. The compounds were identified onthe basis of mass spectra and using the NIST library sto-red in the computer software (version 1.10 beta Shimad-zu) of the GC-MS.
2. 7. Toxicity Study
Phytotoxicity test were performed in order to assess
the toxicity of Reactive Red 141 and its degraded metabo-lites. Tests were carried out according to the procedure re-ported earlier
30 on two kinds of seeds which are com-
monly used in Indian agriculture: Triticum aestivum and
Oryza sativa . The Reactive Red 141 and ethyl acetate ex-
tracted product (dry) were dissolved separately in distilledwater and made the final concentration of 1000 mg/L. To-xicity study was done by growing the seeds (10) of eachplant species separately into control, dye and extractedproduct sample. Germination (%), length of plumule andradical was recorded after 13 days.
2. 8. Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) with Tukey-kramer multiple comparison test. Rea-dings were considered significant when P value was ≤0.05.
3. Results and Discussion
3. 1. Isolation, Screening and Identification
of Microorganism
The bacterial isolate which efficiently decolorized
the various textile dyes in submerged culture was selected.322 Acta Chim. Slov. 2008, 55, 320–329

Telke et al.:   Kinetics and Mechanism of Reactive Red 141 Degradation ...The isolated strain was identified and deposited as Rhizo-
bium radiobacter MTCC 8161 based on morphological,
cultural and biochemical tests (Table 1) into the MicrobialType Culture Collection and Gene Bank (MTCC), Institu-te of Microbial Technology, Chandigarh, India. The sulfo-nated azo dyes are recalcitrant in nature, thus the isolationof bacteria capable of decolorization and mineralizationof sulfonated azo dyes has proven difficult.
31Our isolated
bacterial strain R. radiobacter efficiently decolorized and
degraded the sulfonated diazo dye Reactive Red 141 atstatic anoxic condition.3. 2. Effect of Static and Shaking Condition
The cell growth in shaking condition was much higher
than static condition but there was little decolorization (6%)and COD reduction (16.66%) in shaking condition, while90% decolorization with 83.33% decrease in COD was ob-served at static anoxic condition within 48 h (Figure 1). Thepseudomonas sp. decolorized the Direct Black 38 within 5
days under anaerobic condition
32and Stenotrophomonas
acidaminiphila (BN-3) decolorized the C. I. Acid Red 88
within 60 h.33The pH of the culture medium remains con-
stant (pH 7.0) during the entire decolorization process.
3. 3. Effect of Initial Dye 
and Inoculum Concentration
R. radibacter was efficiently decolorizes the increa-
sing concentration of dyes (100, 200, 300, 400 and 500mg/L) with a decolorizing efficiency varying from60–90%, where the diazo dye Reactive Black 5 decolori-zation by Candida oleophila was significantly inhibitedTable 1. Morphological, cultural and biochemical test for identifi-

tion was proportional to dye concentration. The increasein dye concentration has no adverse effect on the growthof an organism (Figure 2). After 24 h, the growth of anorganism increases with increase in dye concentration.The relation between substrate dependent specific deco-lorization rate and equilibrium conversion was shown inFigure 3.
The kinetic constants estimated from the experimen-
tal data were 1.26 mg/g cell /h for v
dye, maxand 50 mg/L for
Km.The specific decolorization rate significantly increa-
ses with increase in dye concentration (more than 50%)and equilibrium conversion was above the 80% (50 to 400mg/L). With further increase in dye concentration, thespecific decolorization rate decreased and the equilibriumconversion was above 60% at 500 mg/L of dye concentra-tion, similar results were reported in case of azo dye deco-lorization by Rhodopseudomonas palustris.
24
There was increase in decolorization rate with rise
in inoculum concentration. The maximum rate of color re-moval was observed at a 20% inoculum concentrationwith 90% decolorization efficiency. Beyond the 20% in-oculum decolorization rate was not significantly in-creased, similar result was reported earlier.

3. 4. Decolorization of Repeated Addition 
of Dye Aliquots
The intention of this study was to check the ability
of organism for the repeated decolorization of dye. The R.
radiobacter decolorized the repeated addition of Reactive
Red 141 dye up to six cycles with variable decolorizationrate (74–90%), whereas the mixed bacterial culture deco-lorized the azo dye up to three cycles.
36In first cycle 90%
decolorization of first dye aliquot required 48 h, 79% de-colorization within 12 h in second and third cycles, thepercent decolorization (74%) and time (6 h) remains con-stant up to last cycle (Figure 4).3. 5. Effect of Carbon and Nitrogen Sources
The reduction of azo dyes depends on the presence
and availability of a co-substrate37because it acts as an
electron donor for the azo dye reduction. The rate of azo-reduction process also depends on the type of co-substrateused and chemical structure of the azo dyes.
38Many diffe-
rent co-substrates were found to suite as electron donor,like glucose
14and yeast extract.39Reactive Red 141 was
decolorized up to 2% in control (BHM medium), whereas,up to 85.71% decolorization was observed in presence ofyeast extract (0.5%) and urea (0.5%) in BHM. When onlyyeast extract was supplemented as sole carbon and nitro-gen source, 56.52% decolorization observed. Similar re-sults were reported in Bacterium RvM 11.1 in presence ofglucose and yeast extract.
40In order to check the influen-
ce of other carbon sources on the decolorization pattern ofReactive Red 141, the yeast extract was supplemented324 Acta Chim. Slov. 2008, 55, 320–329

te. There was significant growth with reduced decoloriza-tion rate in presence of these effective carbon and energysources, 11.42% decolorization was observed in glucose(0.5%) as carbon source, 36.58% in mannitol (0.5%),17.50% in sucrose (0.5%) and 22.22% in sodium citrate(0.5%) (Table 2).
The effect of various nitrogen sources on the decolo-
rization performance R. radiobacter was tested by using
organic (each of 0.5%; urea, yeast extract and peptone) aswell as inorganic (each of 0.5%; ammonium acetate andammonium chloride) nitrogen sources (Table 2). The or-Decolorization Dry cell

activity of intracellular lignin peroxidase (119%), extra-cellular lignin peroxidase (109%), azo reductase (177%),MG reductase (330%) and DCIP reductase (112%) wasobserved when compared with the control (0 h) (Table 3).In this study, induction of lignin peroxidase (extracellularand intracellular), azo reductase, MG reductase andDCIP reductase strongly indicate that Reactive Red 141can be oxidatively and reductively cleaved into the sim-ple metabolites.

3. 6. Enzymatic Analysis
The term azo dye reduction may involve different
mechanisms or locations like enzymatic,41non-enzyma-
tic,21mediated,42intracellular43and various combinations
of these mechanisms and locations. Oxidative biodegra-dation takes place upon action of enzymes such as pero-xidases and laccases. The involvement of fungal peroxi-dases and laccases for the oxidation of sulfonated azodyes has been reported earlier.

3. 8. Toxicity Study
Phytotoxicity revealed the toxic nature of Reactive
Red 141 to the Triticum aestivum and Oryza sativa plants.
Germination (%) of both the plants was less with ReactiveRed 141 treatment as compared to their degradation pro-duct and distilled water. The Reactive Red 141 was signi-
ficantly reducing the length of plumule and radical thanits degradation product which indicated the less toxicityof the degraded products (Table 4).
4. Conclusion
Hence the present study indicates biodegradation of
Reactive Red 141 through oxidative and reductive enzy-mes of R. radiobacter into different metabolites. We sug-
gested the degradation pathway of Reactive Red 141 onthe basis of GC-MS analysis. Azo dyes can be cleavedsymmetrically or asymmetrically depending on the struc-ture of substrate and active site of an enzyme. Initiallyasymmetric oxidative cleavage leads to formation of mo-noazo intermediates which can be further oxidatively andreductively cleaved into simple metabolites. The identi-fied products were naphthalene diazonium, 1, 3, 5-triazine2, 4-diol, p-dinitrobenzene and 2-nitroso naphthol. Due toinvolvement of various enzymes it is very difficult to defi-ne exact role of each enzyme in biodegradation, it requirethe further purification of enzymes. The strain has poten-tial to degrade various dyes having structural hierarchiesinto less toxic compounds.

Iz odpadne vode tekstilne industrije v Ichalkaranji, Indija, je bila izolirana bakterija Rhizobium radiobacter MTCC
8161. Ta bakterija je sposobna razbarvanja razli~nih azo, trifenilmetanskih, disperznih in reaktivnih barvil pri stati~nihanoksi~nih pogojih ter pri optimalni pH vrednosti 7,0 in temperature 30 °C do 80–95 % stopnje z 83,33 % redukcijoKPK. Poskusi so bili izvedeni z razli~nimi viri ogljika in du{ika od katerih sta kvasni ekstrakt in se~nina dala najbolj{erezultate. Razbarvanje lahko pripi{emo razli~nim induciranim oksidativnim in reduktivnim encimom. Toksikolo{ke {tu-dije so pokazale manj toksi~no naravo razgradnega produkta.
