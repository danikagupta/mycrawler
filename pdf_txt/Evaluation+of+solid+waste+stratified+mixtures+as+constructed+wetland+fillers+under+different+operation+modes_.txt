Abstract  12 
Based on the strategy that all processes can and should be modified to contribute to a 13 
circular economy , this work  evaluates the recovery of waste solids as filler material in 14 
Constructed Wetlands (CWs)  used for wastewater treatment . Five sets of lab -scale CWs 15 
were assembled with mixtures of five waste solids and operated to evaluate the removal 16 
of chemical oxygen demand ( COD ) and nutrients from urban and industrial -types of 17 
wastewater . The adaptation and growth of the macrophyte Phragmites australis  in the 18 
mixed -filler CWs was also monitored. Although all evaluated waste solids showed to be 19 
acceptable  substrates for macrophyte development and wastewater treatment, CWs 20 
assembled with mixtures  of limestone waste and coal slag showed the best plant growth 21 
indicators and wastewater treatment efficiencies . The  CWs assembled with mixtures of 22 
limestone waste and clay brick fragments  or cork granulates showed to be suitable 23 
alternatives . With excepti on for CWs filled with mixtures of limestone and snail shells, 24 
pollutant removal efficiencies up to  95%, 86% and 83%  were obtained respectively for 25 
COD , total phosphorous  and total nitrogen , depending on the type of wastewater and 26 
mode of operation . Remova l efficiencies were not significantly affected by increased 27 
hydraulic rate. The CWs can be operated to a hydraulic loading rate of 0.056 m/d, which 28 
corresponds to a retention time of 1.5 days . The valorisation of solid waste as a filler can 29 
contribute to C Ws closely participating in the creation of circular flows for the reuse of 30 
waste solids.  31

1. Introduction  34 
The effective and widespread implementation of a circular economy can contribute to 35 
ensuring healthy and sustainable growth or even survival of societies. Although the 36 
fundamentals of circular economy are not recent, related concepts and strategies are 37 
currently relevant topics and are interrelated with sustainability principles and objectives 38 
(Korhonen et al., 2018; Pieroni et al., 2019) . 39 
Circular econom y knowledge and  tools are evolving, but only a few cases of materials 40 
and energy flows can be converted completely into closed circuits.  However, all processes 41 
can be included as an incremental part of a larger loop, such as the recycling and recovery 42 
of packaging materials (Civancik -Uslu et al., 2019) , house hold waste plastics (Huysveld 43 
et al., 2019)  and, particularly, the reuse of treated wastewater (Akhoundi and Nazif, 2018)  44 
or sludge originated in wastewater treatment facilities (de Azevedo et al., 2018) . 45 
Constructed Wetlands (CWs) of subsurface flow type , although an examp le of a n eco- 46 
efficient and cleaner technology for wastewater treatment, require a granular filling 47 
medium as the main construction material which usually represents the major  fraction of 48 
capital expenditure  (Yang et al., 2018) . In order t o improve the wastewater treatment, 49 
special manmade or modified natural materials can be used, which represents high energy 50 
and raw material consumption. Examples of these kind of materials are light expanded 51 
clay aggregates (Mateus and Pinho, 2010)  and calcium silicate hydrate (Li et al., 2015) . 52 
Alternative low -cost materials, including solid waste,  were the subject  of intense research 53 
in recent  years. Examples of alternative materials are broken bricks and oyster shells 54 
(Wang et al., 2013) , dewatered alum sludge (Zhao et al., 2011) , limestone rock waste 55 
(Mateus et al. , 2012) , rice straw and ceramsite (Cao et al., 2016)  and rubber t yre chips 56 
(Chyan et al., 2013) . 57 
The reuse of waste materials allows CWs to be included as part of a recovery cycle of 58 
these materials, preventing them from being sent to lan dfills. The recovery and 59 
valori sation of treated water and the valori sation of the produced biomass (macrophytes) 60 
can also contribute to integrate the CWs in the circular reuse of water and bioeconomic 61 
resources  (Avellán and Gremillion, 2019; Masi et al., 2018) . 62 
Although there are many studies evaluat ing the potential of using waste materials  at 63 
bench -scale in wastewater treatment applications , there are still few studies that 64 
demonstrate their effective use in CWs, both in terms of confirmation of their quality as 65  This is the accepted version of manuscript published by Journal of Cleaner Production,  Volume 253, 20 April 2020, 119986 , available at 
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652620300330?via%3Dihub  (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.119986 ) 
 
filler and contribution to wastewater  treatment as well as its quality to ensure the healthy 66 
growth of macrophytes, which represent an essential component of CWs.  67 
The present study was conducted to assess the performance of five waste materials as 68 
CWs fillers, both in terms of pollutant removal efficiency from urban and industrial 69 
wastewaters under different operating conditions and macrophyte adaptation to the waste 70 
materials. The evaluated residual materials included solid resi dues whose recovery is 71 
usually little explored, as is the case of coal burning slags and granulates resulting from 72 
cork transformation. The use of coal for energy generation is still very representative on 73 
a world scale, and even if in the future it will b e reduced or even eliminated , the slag 74 
generated will continue to be deposited in landfills  (Ryabov et al., 2019) . Similarly, t he 75 
cork industry is very representative worldwide, but particularly in Portugal , with large 76 
quantities of cork waste being generated  (Sepúlveda et al., 2018) . 77 
Considering that previous bench -scale studies have shown that waste materials ca n 78 
contribute in a differentiated way to the removal of pollutants from wastewater (Mateus 79 
and Pinho, 2018), the simultaneous use of different fillers c ould allow CWs to adapt to 80 
specific type s of wastewater to be treated and contribute to the valoris ation of  a wider 81 
range of solid waste.  This is the first study to evaluate the reuse of mixtures of limestone 82 
waste with one of the following solid wastes: clay brick fragments, coal slags, cork 83 
granulates and  snail shells.  Therefore, the present work has three main goals: (i) evaluate 84 
an innovative combination of stratified -mixtures of waste solids as filling media for 85 
constructed wetlands; ii) evaluate the capabilities of those mixtures to guarante e the 86 
healthy growth of the macrophyte plants; iii) evaluate the stratified -mixture constructed 87 
wetlands robustness to variations in the operation conditions.  88

2.1 Wastewater  91 
In this study tw o types of wastewater were used:  a syn thetic low strength  urban -type 92 
wastewater and an industrial pre -treated effluent.  Table 1 shows the average composition 93 
of both types of wastewater over the trial period.  The synthetic wastewater was prepared 94 
with tap water , phosphorus, nitrogen  and potassium salts , and with glucose as a source of 95 
carbon . The industrial effluent was collected from the drained outlet of a wine ry by- 96  This is the accepted version of manuscript published by Journal of Cleaner Production,  Volume 253, 20 April 2020, 119986 , available at

product  distillery industry after secondary treatment by anaerobic digestion. The collected 97 
wastewater was transported to the experimental site and was stored during the trial period 98 
of phases 4 and 5 (section 2.4) in feeding tanks , at an average temperature of 15  ºC in the 99 
absence of light  and analysed before being dosed into the wetland systems.  100

2.2 Building  of the constructed wetland prototype s  110 
In order to  evaluate the potential of various combinations of waste materials to treat 111 
wastewater , duplicates of five sets of lab-scale  vertical flow  (VF) CWs were built. CW s 112 
systems consisted of truncated cone pots in black o paque PVC plastic with 35.0 cm  113 
31.5 cm  39.0 cm in height, lower and upper diameter. A schematic diagram and a picture 114 
of the experimental wetl and units are provided in Fig.  1.  115

(2) picture  of pot without filler .  119 
Combinations of five solid wastes were employed as filling materials for the CWs: cork 120 
granulates resulting from the cork industry; snail shells resulting from the food and 121 
catering industr ies; coal slag resulting from coal power plants; clay brick fragments  and 122 
limestone rock fragments, both resulting from construction activities.  123 
A reference set was filled with limestone fragments only, already shown to be a good CW 124 
substrate (Mateus et al., 2012) . The remaining four sets were filled with three layers, 7 125 
cm bottom and top layers of limestone fragments and a 15 cm inner layer of the evaluated 126 
waste material. Total volume occupied by the filling media is 28 L. The area at the sur face 127 
of the filling was 0,116 m2. Fig. 2 presents a photograph of the materials and a schem e 128 
representing the three -layers assembly.  129

Physical properties, i.e. particle size distribution, true density, loose bulk density and 135 
voids, of the five materials tested ha d already been determined i n a previous study 136 
(Mateus and Pin ho, 2018) . The working bulk porosity of the CWs was evaluated by 137 
measuring the required water volume to flood the pots filled with the different waste 138 
material combinations. The three -layer combinations and the mixed -filler working 139 
porosity of the five lab-scale CW sets are reported in Table 2.   140

Each CW was equipped with two discharge valves at different depths, approximately 2.6 145 
and 12.0 cm below the surface of the top layer, to allow working at two flooding ratios , 146 
respectively 89% and 54% , which consist in the  wastewater volume to total void volume 147 
of the filling .  148 
 149 
2.3. Cultivation details and plant growth  monitoring  150 
The five sets of CW prototypes  were kept indoors, exposed to daylight through glass 151 
walls. Average, minimum and maximum room temperature for the period of the 152 
experiment was 21.6  ± 3.2 ºC, 20.5  ± 3.0 ºC, 22.4  ± 3.5 ºC , respectively . 153 
The CWs systems were fed with wastewater between January and November 2018. 154 
Different operating conditions were tested in five experimental phases. These will be 155 
elaborated on below, in section 2.4.  156 
In January, CWs were planted with two shoots  of the Phragmites australis  reed, which 157 
was approximating equivalent to 17 shoots per square meter. The reeds were monitored 158  This is the accepted version of manuscript published by Journal of Cleaner Production,  Volume 253, 20 April 2020, 119986 , available at 
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652620300330?via%3Dihub  (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.119986 ) 
 
every two weeks for the height of the shoots and the number of new shoots . For the 159 
primary shoots (those that sprouted up to mid -March, about 2 months after planting) 160 
average rates of stem elongation were obtained through linear regression of stalk height 161 
plotted against time.  162 
In November, at the autumnal end of the first growing season and approximately 10 163 
months after planting, the above -ground biomass was harvested, and its fresh weight 164 
measured. Representative samples of the stem and lea ves of the plants were finely  165 
chopped  using a cutter -grinder. Sub -samples were dried at 60 °C to constant weight and 166 
dry weight  (dw) was determined. The results were used to determine reed biomass 167 
productivity for the first plants growth cycle per CW area.  In addition, t he chlorophyll 168 
pigment content of representative samples of the harvested leaves was measured. Firstly , 169 
approximately 50 mg of leaves  were extracted with 1 mL 80% acetone and total 170 
chloro phyll, as well as chlorophyll -a and  chlorophyll -b, was determined by a 171 
spectrophotometer assay  method  (Gechev et al., 2013) . Absorbance was read at both 172 
663.6 and 646.6 nm in a spectrophotometer (CADAS100 DRLANGE , Germany) . 173 
Quantification of the pigment content was performed using equations (1) to (3) for 174 
chlorophyll concentrations in g/ml (Porra et al. , 1989) : 175 
 176 
Chl a = 12.25 Abs663.6 - 2.55Abs646.6    (1) 177 
Chl b = 20.31 Abs646.6 - 4.91Abs663.6     (2) 178 
Chl a+b = 17.76 Abs646.6 + 7.34A bs663.6    (3) 179 
 180 
Finally, t he calculated values were then converted to a per fresh weight basis ( g/gf w). 181 
 182 
2.4. Wastewater treatment experiments  183 
The wastewater treatment experiments performed in the CWs  were divided in five phases 184 
based on the two types of wastewater studied and  the different operation  conditions  185 
evaluated . 186 
Phase 1  corresponded to the first two week s after planting, consisting of a period of 187 
acclimatization to allow the establishment of biological activity. The CWs were operated 188  This is the accepted version of manuscript published by Journal of Cleaner Production,  Volume 253, 20 April 2020, 119986 , available at 
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652620300330?via%3Dihub  (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.119986 ) 
 
in a discontinuous mode for two successive fill -and-drain cycles using effluent from a 189 
pilot-scale tertiary -treatment CW in  operation for 8 years.  The wastewater was dosed 190 
manually into the CWs on Mondays and left without circulation. Afterwards, the water 191 
was drained on Fridays and the systems remained dry over the weekend.  192 
Phase 2 and 3  occurred in the following  3 months, February, March and April, when the  193 
CWs were fed with the urban  wastewater. Phase 2 investigates the effect of the contact 194 
time, i.e. hydraulic retention time (HRT). The CWs were operated in a discontinuous 195 
mode for successive fill -and-drain cyc les, with one dry day , HRTs of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 196 
days, which correspond to 12, 24, 48, 96,  144 and 192 hours respectively , and with an 197 
89% flooding ratio. In phase 3  the effect of the flooding ratio  was investigated . Therefor e, 198 
the CWs were operated i n continuous mode with vertical flow towards the bottom. First, 199 
they were operated at a n 89% flood rate for about three  weeks until they reached a pseudo 200 
steady state, then the flood rate was changed to 54% and the CWs continued to operate 201 
until the new st eady state was reached. The flow was monitored regularly by weight - 202 
based measurement (Mettler Toledo PB8001 -L) and was kept constant at 6.46 10-3 ± 203 
0.1210-3 m3day-1 by peristaltic pumps with four channels (323S /D, Watson -Marlow Inc, 204 
Wilmington, USA), corresponding to a hydraulic loading rate ( HLR) of 5.5510-2 ± 205 
1.4510-3 m/d. The mean  HRT  was of 1.52 ± 0. 09 days, corresponding to 3 7 ± 2 hours , 206 
excluding the LCS set.  The lower porosity of the LCS CWs resulted in an HRT of 207 
approximately half this value  (0.76 ± 0.01 days , corresponding to 18.2 ± 0.2 hours ). In 208 
order to obtain comparable results , two LCS CWs were operated in a sequential cascade 209 
arrangement.  210 
Phases 4 and  5 occurred  during the month of May , when  the CWs were fed with the 211 
industrial wastewater. Phase 4 was carried out to investigate the effect of the contact time. 212 
As above, CWs were operated in discontinuous mode with a flooding of 89%. HRTs 213 
studied we re 1 day, 2 days, and, for the last batch, a total of 4 days comprising a refeeding 214 
back the effluents into the respective systems after two 2 days , separated by a resting 215 
period of 4 hours. In Phase 5  the effect of the addition of an external biodegradable carbon 216 
source  was investigated . CWs were operated with the optimized HRT from phase 4 and 217 
0.15 grams of glucose were added per lit re of fresh industrial wastewater.  218 
 219 
2.5 Sampling and analysis  220  This is the accepted version of manuscript published by Journal of Cleaner Production,  Volume 253, 20 April 2020, 119986 , available at 
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652620300330?via%3Dihub  (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.119986 ) 
 
In the discontinuous operation mode, the samples w ere collected from a feedwater 221 
container immediately before contacting the filling of the CWs . After completing the 222 
selected HRT the water content of each CW was drained into receiving container s.  223 
Representative water samples were collected from each rece iving container after mixing.  224 
In the continuous flow experiments, the samples were collected at the inlet and outlet of 225 
each CW unit, two and three weeks after the start of the continuous operation in each set 226 
of tested operative conditions . The average of  the measurements in these two sampling 227 
moments is reported.  228 
Collected samples were analysed immediately for the environmental parameters 229 
temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO) and conductivity with an HI -98194 230 
multiparameter meter and respective  probes  supplied by Hanna Instruments. The analysis 231 
of TN, TP, TSS, COD and water colour was carried out using an HI -83399 232 
spectrophotometer and an HI -839800 reactor block, both supplied by Hanna Instruments. 233 
Standard procedures were used, as highlighted by the su pplier. The 5 -day biochemical 234 
oxygen demand ( BOD 5) determination was carried out according to the standard methods 235 
for the examination of water and wastewater  (Rice e t al., 2017) . At least two replicates 236 
were made of all assays and measurements.  237 
2.6. Data analysis  238 
Statistical tests were performed using IBM SPSS® software, version 24.  One-way 239 
ANOVA, Kruskal -Wallis test, T -test and  Post Hoc tests were performed at a significance 240 
level of  95% (p= 0.05). 241 
All numerical confidence intervals were computed from the standard deviation assuming 242 
a 95% confidence level.  243

3.1. Macrophyte growth evaluation  246 
To evaluate the adaptation of macrophytes to the waste solids combinations, the growth 247 
of the plants was monitored during a growing season, after which the plants were 248 
harvested to assess the dry biomass yield.  Figures S1 to S6 (Supplementary material) 249  This is the accepted version of manuscript published by Journal of Cleaner Production,  Volume 253, 20 April 2020, 119986 , available at

not affected by the changes in the operation mode but dependent on the kind of filling 254 
material. Table 3 presents the average growth rate calculated from linear fitting to Fig. 3 255 
data. The highest average plant height was observed for CWs LCG and LCS, whose 256 
values are significantly differen t from the other CWs.  257

3 Total biomass productivity was estimated in dry weight basis for the first plants growth cycle of 10 267 
months.  268 
 269 
Growth rates were highest for plants grown in LCS, LBF and LCG  CWs by that order, 270 
and all were higher than for growth rate of p lants grown in the reference LO CW.  271 
Otherwise, the macrophyte plants showed the lowest growth rate in the LSS CW , which 272 
value is statistically different from the remaining CWs . Despite the highest number of 273 
primary shoots, the LSS filling figures the worst growth indicat ors. The l eaves of the 274 
plants grown in LSS CW showed the lower chlorophylls contents, which justify the low er 275 
biomass productiv ity due to minor  rates of photosynthesis . However, due to the dispersion 276 
of the results obtained, the ANOVA performed does not pr esent statistical significance in 277 
the mean values for each type of pigment.  278 
LCG and LCS filling combinations showed to be favourable  substrate to plant growth 279 
with outstanding growth indicators when compared to the LO filling.  All growth 280 
indicators are significantly different when LCG and LCS results are directly compared 281 
with the LO results (p<0.05).  282

3.2. Batch mode operation with  urban-type wastewater  (phase 2)  284 
COD and nutrient removal efficiencies for the batch experiments using synthetic urban - 285 
type wastewater are presented in Fig. 4.  286 
The COD removal from the wastewater was always greater than 70% and not significantly 287 
affected by the HRT  (Tables A1 and A2 in the Appendix  A). All mixed -filling CW 288 
showed high performances with removal efficiencies better than the reference LO CW. 289 
The average COD removal rate was significantly higher at CWs LCG and LCS (Table 290 
A1). The LCS CW showed the best removal efficiencies even for the low est HRT.  291 
The LSS CW showed the lowest TP and TN removal efficiencies. Moreover, this CW 292 
showed an unexpected trend as the increase in HRT causes a decrease in nutrient removal 293 
efficiency, the reason of which is un clear.  294 
TP removal efficiencies are no t significantly different for the CWs LO, LBF and LCG 295 
(Table A1). TP removal efficiencies of LCG  CW were comparable to the LO efficiencies. 296 
LCS CW showed the highest TP removal efficiencies  and significatively  higher than 297  This is the accepted version of manuscript published by Journal of Cleaner Production,  Volume 253, 20 April 2020, 119986 , available at 
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652620300330?via%3Dihub  (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.119986 ) 
 
those observed with the LO CW. It should  be pointed that the LO filling was already 298 
confirmed as a good substrate for CWs designed for phosphorous removal from 299 
wastewaters  (Mateus et al., 2012) . Although the CW LBF had lower TP removal 300 
efficiencies than the CW LO, the results obtained are nonetheless acceptable  and without 301 
significa nt difference . The efficiencies of TP removal by the LO, LBF, LCG  and LCS 302 
CWs were not significantly affected by the HRT  (Fig. 4 and Table A2). For these three 303 
filling combinations TP removal  efficiencies w ere near 80% even for a HRT of one day.  304 
All but the LSS CW showed TN removal efficiencies higher than the LO CW efficiencies. 305 
LBF and LCS CWs showed the highest TN removal efficiencies, which increase slightly 306 
but not significantly with the HRT increase.  It was observed that the variation of HRT  307 
between 1 and 8 days affects significantly only the removal of nutrients by the LSS CW.   308 
Considering the objective of simultaneously removal of COD, TP and TN source 309 
compounds from the wastewater, the LCG  and LCS CWs consisted in the best systems  310 
when operated in a batch mode . The HRT can be kept as low as 1 day without a significa nt 311 
effect on the pollutant s removal efficiency. Lower HRT corresponds to higher HLR and 312 
higher usability of the CWs systems.  313

3.3. Continuous mode operation with  urban -type wastewater  (phase 3)  320 
The capability for the mixed -filled CWs to operate in continuous mode was evaluated for 321 
a HLR of 5.5510-2 ± 1.4510-3 m/d, which corresponds to an average HRT of 1.52 ± 322 
0.09 days when the LCS CW set is excluded.  As already mentioned in section 2.4, t he 323 
lower porosity of the LCS CWs resulted in an HRT of  0.76 ± 0.01 days . A similar overall 324 
retention time was obtained through sequential operation of two LCS CWs.  325

The continuous mode of operation was tested with a flooding ratio of 89%  and in a partial 326 
percolating setup  (54% flooding) , where only half height of the porous filling was 327 
flooded. The obtained average COD and nutrient removal efficiencies are presented in 328 
Fig. 5, which  contains the results for  both flooding ratios  and the interp olated results  329 
obtained in batch mode (section 3.2)  equivalent to the continuous average HRT  (1.52 330 
days) . Table A3 contains the statistical analysis of the data presented in Fig. 5.  331 
COD removal from the urban -type wastewater was not significantly affected by the 332 
operation mode, n or by the lower water level in the percolating mode. The LCS CW 333 
showed the highe st COD removal efficiencies but all CWs performed above 60% of 334 
removal efficiency.  335 
Otherwise, all but the LC S CW performed worse in continuous mode than in batch mode 336 
concerning TP removal from the urban -type wastewater. Although it was not a clear trend, 337 
the percolating mode improves the TP removal efficiencies. The LCS CW showed to be 338 
a stable system as the TP  removal was higher than 80%. Both batch and percolating 339 
modes have in common the characteristic  of allowing the particle bed aeration, which 340 
may have potentiated the degradation of phosphorus compounds by aerobic processes.  341 
As for TP removal, TN removal e fficiencies were slightly negatively affected by the 342 
continuous operation mode in comparison with the batch mode. The relative trend was 343 
similar to  the batch mode trend: LCG  and LSS CWs performed in a similar way as the 344 
reference LO CW; LBF and LCS CWs per formed better than the LO CW. The percolating 345 
mode improved all the five lab -scale CWs concerning TN removal. As for TP removal, 346 
aerobic processes may have contributed to the TN removal, improving the 347 
nitrification/denitrification steps associated to the r emoval of nitrogen compounds from 348 
wastewater.  349

3.4. Experiments  with industrial wastewater  (Phases 4 and 5)  357 
During experimental phases 4 and 5, the five sets of lab -scale CWs were used for 358 
treatment of wastewater from a distillery after aerobic and anaerobic treatments in the 359 
industrial facility. T he wastewater fulfils  the quality requirements concerning COD, 360 
BOD5 and TSS, but  fails the required limits concerning TP and, mainly, TN. The situation 361 
is typical for most Portuguese industrial and urban wastewater treatment facilities not 362 
equipped with  tertiary nor advanced treatment systems, being the removal of nutri ents the 363 
utmost challenge. For this particula r case, the ratios C:N:P  (COD :TN:TP)  (41:37:1 ), 364 
 This is the accepted version of manuscript published by Journal of Cleaner Production,  Volume 253, 20 April 2020, 119986 , available at

presents a n additional difficulty because they are very different from the recommended 365 
ratios for biological denitrification process . The denitrification potential of wastewater is 366 
primarily a function of the available organic carbon, which is usually expressed as the 367 
COD:N or the BOD 5:N ratios. Available  studies report a wide range of COD:N ratios 368 
required for satisfactory denitrificati on processes , which can be  between 4 an d 15 369 
(Metcalf & Eddy et al., 2014; Peng  et al., 2007) . If the proportion of biodegradable carbon  370 
is low the efficiency of the denitrification process is impaired, and an external carbon 371 
source is required (Liwarska -Bizukojć et al., 2018; Swinarski et al., 2012; Wang et al., 372 
2019) . In addit ion, t he biological removal of nitrogen compounds from wastewater is 373 
attained through both nitrification and denitrification processes which require, 374 
respectively, aerobic and anaerobic environments (Kadlec and Wallace, 2009; Metcalf & 375 
Eddy et al., 2014) . The anaerobic environments are guaranteed  by the deep -water  levels 376 
in the CWs. A partial aerobic environ ment  is provided by the oxygen transport from reeds 377 
roots to their surroundi ngs (Bezbaruah and Zhang, 2005; Colmer, 2003) . A more 378 
enhanced aerobic environment can be provided by operating CWs in a tidal -flow mode, 379 
with alternated fill and drain periods  (Chang et al., 2014) . Aiming to study the potential 380 
of nitrification enhancement through aeration of the CWs’ filler matrix, a set of assays 381 
were carried out in phase 4 in tidal -flow operating mode.  The effects of the addition of a n 382 
external  carbon source was evaluated in phase 5.  383 
 384 
3.4.1 Residence time and tidal-flow effects evaluation (phase 4)  385 
Fig. 6 presents the COD and nutrient removal efficiencies of the five lab -scale CWs 386 
treating the distillery wastewater in batch mode. Tables A4 and A5, in the Appendix  A, 387 
include the statistical analysis of the data in Fig. 6. The increase in the HRT did  not affect 388 
significantly any of the observed removal efficiencies, neither did the tidal -flow operation 389 
mode contribute to improve the removal processes. The results indicate that the increase 390 
in oxygen availability did  not favour  nutrient removal processes in the distillery 391 
wastewater , as the observed differences fail within the typical variation -range in CW 392 
systems (Mateus and Pinho, 2010) . 393 
The results also indicated that retention time increase did  not contribute to increase the 394 
COD and nutrient removal efficiencies, which mean s that one day contact is enough to 395 
obtai n the maximum removal efficiencies. However, the observed removal efficiencies 396  This is the accepted version of manuscript published by Journal of Cleaner Production,  Volume 253, 20 April 2020, 119986 , available at 
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652620300330?via%3Dihub  (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.119986 ) 
 
were lower than the efficiencies obtained when the CWs treated the synthetic urban -type 397 
wastewater. The worse performance for the CWs treating industrial  wastewater can be 398 
justified by the relative higher content of nitrogen compounds in industrial  wastewater 399 
than in the urban -type wastewater. The lower ratio BOD 5/COD in the industrial  400 
wastewater compared to the same ratio in the urban type  wastewater may also have 401 
contributed to the observed lower CWs performances when treating the industrial  402 
wastewater.  403 
All but TP removal efficiencies by LSS CW were higher than COD and nutrient removal 404 
performances by the LO CW. LCS CW showed the be st removal efficiencies, near 80%  405 
removal for both COD and TP and near 40% for TN removal from wastewater.  406

3.4.2 Evaluation of the effectd of adding a n external carbon source (phase  413 
5) 414 
In order  to evaluate the enhancement in nutrient removal efficiency by the increase in the 415 
COD:TN ratio, glucose was added to the industrial wastewater. The addition of glucose 416 
increased the C OD:TN:TP ratios from 41:37:1  to 112:37:1.  417 
Fig. 7 contains the COD and nutrient removal efficiencies of the five lab -scale CWs 418 
treating the distillery wastewater after glucose addition.  The bars marked with “G” 419 
represent the efficiencies in the assays w here glucose was added to the wastewater. 420 
Circles an d diamonds in the COD removal chart represent the COD concentration at CWs 421 
outflow respectively for wastewater with added glucose and wastewate r without glucose 422 
addition . Table A6, in the Appendix  A, contains the statistical analysis of the data in Fig. 423 
7. 424 
COD removal efficiencies have shown an increase when glucose was added. However, 425 
glucose addition did  not contribute to a net effect in the COD removal, as the COD 426 
concentration did  not decrease below the outflow concentrations observed without 427 
glucose ad dition. The glucose was effectively  biodegraded without improving the 428 
removal of the originally present oxidable compounds. In the other hand, the glucose 429 
addition contributed to improve the TP removal capabilities of CWs LCG , LSS and LBF, 430 
and contributed to improve the TN removal of all CWs.  431 
When comparing CWs observed performance differences , it was found that all mixed - 432 
filled CWs performed better than the LO CW , with exception for the TP removal 433 
efficiency of LSS CW. LCS CW showed the higher removal efficiencies for all three 434 
classes of monitored  pollutants. The LCG  and LBF CWs showed to be acceptable 435 
alternative systems  concerning this kind of wastewater.  436

Table 4 contains a summary  of the COD and nutrient s removal efficiency results  obtained 444 
in this work  and a comparison with results presented in the literature. The range of COD 445 
and nutrient removal rates depend on the type of CW system, mode of operation and type 446 
of wastewater. The highest pollutants  removal rates  are usually observed for CWs 447 
designed with  expensive fillings , hybrid systems or multistage modules, which present 448 
higher capital and operation costs . 449

The removal rates of the referred works in table 4 range from 42 to 93%, 6 to 9 7% and 4 458 
to 87%, for COD, TP and TN removal , respectively . The lowe st removal rates in this 459 
work were obtained for the LSS CWs, filled with a mixture of limestone and snail shells 460 
from the food industry. That lowe st rates are 30%, 6% and 13%, for COD, TP and TN 461 
removal , respectively . Except for  the lowest value  of COD removal  obtained , all results 462 
of present work fill  within the literature range or are even higher.  463 
CWs filled with a stratified mixture of limestone,  from construction stones industry, and 464 
coal slag, from coal power plants  (LCS CWs) , showed to be the  best system, whose 465 
removal rates range from 75 to 97%, 76 to 91% and 35 to 89%, for COD, TP and TN 466 
removal , respectively . The highe st removal rates were obtained with the  batch operation 467 
mode at a hydraulic retention time of about  1.5 days. However, a  continuous operation 468 
mode at the same equivalent retention time is an adequate alternative. The continuous 469 
operation with a partial flooding of the filler media can slightly improve the pollutants 470 
removal efficiencies . In spite of this,  the verified efficienc ies were lower than the obtained 471 
in batch mode. In addition, the results show that LCS CWs performed significantly better 472 
(p<0.05) than the reference LO CWs for all operation modes, which can be interpreted as 473 
an evidence of CW improvement by using a mixed -filler of waste solids when compared 474 
to traditional single -filling CWs.  475 
Mix-filled CWs with limestone and clay brick fragments, also from construction activities 476 
(CBF CWs), and CWs with limestone and cork granulates, a solid waste from the cork 477 
industry (LCG CWs), showed performances similar to, or generally better than, the 478 
reference single -filling LO CW and can  be also acceptable solutions t hat enable the 479 
recover y of waste solids for the treatment of wastewater by constructed wetlands.  480 
 481 
4. Conclusions  482 
Reusing  solid waste as filler media represents a way to avoid disposal in landfills while 483 
reducing investment costs in the implementation of constructed wetland for wastewater 484 
treatment. In addition , some materials can improve CWs  treatment capabilities by direct ly 485 
intervening  in the pollutant  removal processes from the wastewat er.  486 
The feasibility of using mixtures of different solid waste s as filler media was evaluated 487 
through a set of lab -scale CWs planted with Phragmites australis .  488  This is the accepted version of manuscript published by Journal of Cleaner Production,  Volume 253, 20 April 2020, 119986 , available at 
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652620300330?via%3Dihub  (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.119986 ) 
 
The obtained results show ed that: 489 
(i) The macrophyte plants adapted well to all but the CW whose filler consisted 490 
in a mixture of limestone fragments and snail shell waste s; 491 
(ii) Although all CWs prototypes filled with mixtures of waste solids can be 492 
satisfactory solutions to treat urban -type wastewater and the tested distillery 493 
wastewater, the combi nation of limestone fragments and coal slags (LCS) 494 
presented the highe st pollutant s removal efficiencies and best macrophyte 495 
growth indicators;  496 
(iii) The combination of limestone fragments and clay brick fragments (LBF) or 497 
cork granulates (LCG) are also acceptable  alternatives as CWs fillers ; 498 
(iv) In the evaluated operation  conditions,  the CWs filled with the mixtures of 499 
waste solids  were not significantly favoured  by the increase in the hydraulic 500 
retention time, which can be set as 1.5 days corresponding to a hydraulic 501 
loading rate of 0.056 m/d;  502 
(v) Depending on the type of wastewater and operation  conditions, t he CWs filled 503 
with most promis ing combinations of w aste solids  operated in a hydraulic 504 
retention time of 1 .5 days  present ed removal efficiencies between  75-95% 505 
COD , 76-86% TP and 35-82% TN, for the LCS CW, 53-88% COD, 28 -73% 506 
TP and 24 -83% TN, for the LBF CW, and 37 -84% COD, 21 -75% TP and 19 - 507 
62% TN, for the LCG CW.  508 
While traditional Constructed Wetlands represent a clean and green technology for 509 
wastewater treatment, recovery of solid waste as a filler can contribute to these systems 510 
closel y participating in the creation of circular flows for the reuse of waste materials.  511 
CWs designed with mixtures of waste solids  can benefit from the contribution  of the 512 
different material s for removing specific pollutants, improving the CWs robustness to 513 
fluctuations  in wastewater composition and flow rate . 514
