Supplement • Depression: reducing the burdenost episodes of depression in Australians are diagnosed
and treated by general practitioners, who prescribe 85%of the antidepressants subsidised by the Pharmaceutical
Benefits Scheme (PBS).
1,2 When a patient presents, the doctor has
to decide whether the individual has clinical depression and, if so,whether to embark on antidepressant drug therapy or a non-pharmacological therapy . Contrary to much media reporting, GPs
do not inevitably prescribe antidepressants when dealing with
depression and anxiety .
3,4 However, if a drug is to be prescribed, a
decision must be made about which drug to use, or what otherdrug change to make if there has been a lack of response or adverseeffects.
The uptake of new drugs by medical practitioners is mediated
by a complex set of doctor, patient, regulatory and commercial
influences.
5-8 Major influences include the doctors’ experiences
with their patients, the opinions and practices of colleagues, theavailability of the drug on the PBS, whether prescribing of the drugis restricted by the authority system, and the marketing andpromotional activities of pharmaceutical companies.
We have previously reported on a sharp increase in antidepres-
sant prescriptions dispensed in the community that occurred inthe 1990s in Australia (from 5.1 million in 1990 to 8.2 million in1998) with the introduction of the selective serotonin reuptakeinhibitors and other new antidepressants.
1 Here we analyse antide-
pressant sales data to describe changes in choices of antidepres-
sants prescribed by Australian doctors between 1975 and 2002.
METHODS
Total Australian sales of proprietary antidepressants for the period
1975 to 2002 were obtained from IMS Health Australia Pty Ltd,the leading international provider of information on drug use forthe pharmaceutical and healthcare industries. Sales of antidepres-
sants in kilograms were converted into defined daily doses
(DDDs).
9 The DDD is the internationally agreed average daily dose
of a drug when used for its main indication and is the approvedunit for drug utilisation studies. Its use allows the comparison of
drug use independent of differences in price, preparation and
quantity per prescription. The DDD for an antidepressant may notreflect Australian prescribing practice; however, it provides a stablesystem of drug consumption measurement and so can be used to
follow trends in the use of drugs. To compare antidepressant use
per head of population over the period, antidepressant sales werecalculated as DDDs per 1000 people per day (DDDs/1000/day)using the estimated Australian population as at 30 June in each
year (provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics). Antidepres-
sants were categorised as old or new according to year ofmarketing (new antidepressants being those first marketed from1990 onwards).
Individual antidepressant sales for each year are enumerated by
chemical (generic drug) name. The number of drugs contributing80% of sales as a proportion of the total number of drugs availablewas calculated for 1975 and every fifth year to 2000, as well as for

ABSTRACT
Objective:  To examine trends in types of antidepressant 
medications prescribed in Australia between 1975 and 2002.
Design:  Sales data from the Australian pharmaceutical industry 
were used to examine trends in overall antidepressant 
prescribing and changes in the types of antidepressants 
prescribed between 1975 and 2002.
Main outcome measures:  Antidepressant sales were 
expressed as defined daily doses (DDDs) per 1000 people per 
day, using the estimated Australian population for each year obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.
Results:  Average annual growth in the sales of antidepressants 
was 1.1% per year from 1975 to 1990, after which growth rose steeply to reach 29% in 1995. By 2002 the rate of growth had slowed to 6.6%. Eighty per cent of total sales were accounted for by four drugs in 1975, 1980 and 1985; five in 1990; seven 
drugs in 1995 and 2000; and six drugs in 2001 and 2002.
Conclusions:  The rapid growth in antidepressant prescribing 
that was characteristic of the early 1990s, and reflected the 
emergence of new classes of agents, did not continue into the late 1990s. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors now

lated rankings for the 10 top-selling antidepressant agents retro-spectively from 2002.
RESULTS
Overall trends in antidepressant prescribing
From 1975 to 1990, the market was extremely stable (only a 19%
overall increase) at about 10 DDDs/1000/day , with an averagegrowth rate of 1.1% per year (range, −5.7% to
9.1%) (Box 1).
From 1990 to 2002, antidepressant use
increased by 352%, to reach 51.5 DDDs/1000/day . Over this period the average annualgrowth rate was 13.4% (range, −2.6% in the
first year of selective serotonin reuptakeinhibitor [SSRI] sales to 29% in 1995). After1995, the annual rate of growth declined to6.6% in 2002.
Trends in type of antidepressant 
prescribed
In 1990, a major new market opened for
antidepressants with the introduction of the
SSRIs and other new agents (Box 2). Fluoxet-
ine, the first SSRI, was marketed in 1990. Thiswas followed by moclobemide (a reversible monoamine oxidase
inhibitor [MAOI]) in 1992 and by other SSRIs (eg, sertraline and
paroxetine in 1994). Venlafaxine — an inhibitor of both serotonin
and noradrenaline reuptake — reached the market in 1996.
By 2002, the SSRIs and other new antidepressants represented
64.5% and 21.6% of sales (DDDs/1000/day), respectively .Although the proportion of antidepressant use represented bytricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) dropped from 90% in 1990 to
12.8% in 2002, because of the substantial increase in total
antidepressant prescribing, sales of TCAs (DDDs/1000/day) onlydropped to 65% of the 1990 value.
Utilisation within drug class: preferred choices
In each year for which the summary indicators are presented in
Box 3, doctors have been able to select from a large number ofdifferent antidepressant drugs (14 in 1975 and 21 in 2002). In anyone year, however, relatively few drugs were responsible for mostprescribing.
Box 4 ranks the 10 top-selling antidepressant agents in terms of
sales (DDDs/1000/day) for 2002, and retrospectively at 5-, 5- and10-year intervals. In the past 5 years, the market share for each ofthe top-selling TCAs has been below 7% of total sales, all of themsharply affected by the advent of the newer antidepressants.
Box 5 plots the trends for each year from 1990 to 2002 for the
top-selling agents (those that constituted 80% of total antidepres-
sant sales) in 2002. Amitriptyline was the only older agent toremain in the top-selling group. Fluoxetine was the first of thenewer antidepressants and the first choice of all antidepressants in1994 and 1995, after which sertraline has been consistentlypreferred.
DISCUSSION
Antidepressant use was stable from 1975 to 1990, a pattern that is
typical of a mature market. From 1991 to 2002, the data show anearly period of substantial growth in the market, coinciding withthe entry of a major new class of compounds, namely the SSRIs,and later the serotonin–noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors andother new antidepressants. Prescribers quickly favoured the newer
agents over the older ones. This preference may have reflected the
importance that GPs place on the better tolerability of the newerantidepressants.

is the lack of anticholinergic, cardiovascular and other adverse
effects, which were a major limitation of the TCAs.11
It should be recognised that sales data overestimate actual use,
as not all drugs sold to pharmacies are dispensed or taken by
patients. In addition, doctors usually prescribe SSRIs in doses
corresponding to the DDD, whereas TCAs are often prescribed in
doses lower than the assigned DDD, and this is likely to contribute
to the observed differences in use of older and newer agents.1,2
Nevertheless, it is evident that the availability of and the
subsidised access to these new pharmacological agents encouraged
more doctors to diagnose and treat depression over the period.2
The rapid uptake of newer antidepressants during the early 1990swas accompanied by a decrease of only 35% in the use of the
TCAs. This supports the view that the major users of the newer
antidepressants were patients previously untreated with any anti-
depressant rather than those changing from the older drugs.
However, these data cannot inform us as to whether the appropri-
ate patients are being treated with antidepressants.
Another factor influencing GP preference may be the most clear-
cut advantage of the new antidepressants — their lower toxicity in
overdose compared with the TCAs. Recent observational studies
suggest that the increased use by the population of SSRIs has beenassociated with a decline in suicide rates in
Australia and the Nordic countries.
12-14 In
Australia, older adults had the highest
growth in antidepressant use and the greatest
decline in suicide.12 Thus, even if some
antidepressant prescribing is unnecessary or
ineffective, increased exposure to these
agents through prescribing in general prac-tice may have produced a measurable reduc-
t i o n  i n  t h e  b u r d e n  o f  d e p r e s s i o n  i n  t h e
population.
The pace of growth for the antidepressants
has slowed, although a longer period is
required for more confidence in the trend. A
plateauing of growth (“steady state”) has beenobserved previously for individual drugs.
15
In part, it may have been associated with thegreater public effort made to increase com-munity awareness of depression and the
importance of psychological management in
its treatment.
16,17 The observed trend may indicate that the market
for prescribing existing  forms of antidepressant is approaching
saturation. There could be further growth in prescribing if a
significant new type of antidepressant were to be registered andmarketed. Alternatively , there could be a significant decline if
epidemiological evidence of harm emerged (eg, increased suicide
rates), or there was an increased perception in the community thatthe use of these drugs caused harm, as occurred with the
benzodiazepines in the mid 1980s.
5
Australian doctors have made sertraline their first-choice anti-
depressant agent since 1996. It is interesting to note that the firstchoice of antidepressant since the introduction of the SSRIs has
not reached the market dominance attained by amitriptyline in
1975 (50% of market share). The “age” of the overall market maybe a factor influencing uptake of new drugs;
15 doxepin and
dothiepin took much longer to reach their maximum popularitywithin the low-growth TCA market than did successive newantidepressants entering the expanding market after 1990.
Trends in the proportion of the number of antidepressants that
account for 80% of sales to the total number of agents available(Box 3) indicate that doctors prescribe a restricted number ofdifferent antidepressants. This proportion was as high as 0.5 in1995 when the market was unstable and expanding rapidly . By2002, the proportion was the same as in 1975 (0.3), indicating
that, in the long run, doctors prefer to prescribe a limited number
of antidepressant drugs. This is in line with accepted pharmaco-logical advice that prescribers should get to know a few drugs well.
CONCLUSION
Antidepressant prescribing increased substantially following the
introduction of the SSRIs. The SSRIs dominated antidepressantprescribing in Australia by the end of the 1990s, with a small
number of these drugs accounting for most prescriptions.
General practice has a major responsibility in addressing the
burden of depression.
10 It appears that Australian GPs have
responded to unmet needs in the treatment of depression by beingmore ready to diagnose and prescribe for depression, and byswitching to the newer antidepressants. This change is likely to
have been due to a combination of commercial pressures,
