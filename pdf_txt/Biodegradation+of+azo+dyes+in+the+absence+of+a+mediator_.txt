Biocatalysis 2015; 1: 82–108employed in technological applications. Ligninolytic 
basidiomycetes, the white rot fungi, secrete laccase isozymes, involved in lignin oxidative depolymerization/solubilization [7-17].
Laccases belong to the multicopper oxidases (along 
with other enzymes such as tyrosinase and ascorbate oxidase [18-22]), and usually contain four cupric ions, belonging to three distinct spectroscopic types (T1, T2, and T3 [23]), arranged within the enzyme active site so that two targets could be achieved: i) the one-electron oxidation of a reducing substrate by the T1 cupric ion, and ii) the regeneration of the resting state of the enzyme by means of molecular oxygen reduction to water, by the intervention of a tricupric cluster, formed by one T2 cupric ion and two T3 cupric ions, the latter anti-ferromagnetically coupled .
The T1 cupric ion in bacterial laccases presents a 
distorted tetrahedral geometry built up from a strong trigonal set of aminoacidic residues (His-Cys-His) and a relatively weaker ligand in the axial position, generally a Met. In multicopper oxidases such as fungal laccases the Met ligand is replaced by a non-coordinating hydrophobic Leu or Phe residue, leading to a trigonal planar geometry [24]. In any case, the peculiar ligation geometry of the T1 cupric ion and the nature of coordinating aminoacidic 
residues are responsible for the typical strong absorption 
at about 600 nm, corresponding to an intense blue color. By contrast, the contribution of T2 and T3 ions to the protein color is negligible. The polar versus non-polar nature of the axial aminoacidic residues correlates with the redox potential of the T1 cupric ion, and hydrophobic residues such as Phe or Leu have a positive effect, whereas a polar, coordinating residue such as that of Gln (present in the blue, single copper, low-potential protein stellacyanin) shows the opposite effect. Such effects have been studied 
in detail in the bacterial blue copper, high-redox-potential 
protein rusticyanin from Thiobacillus ferrooxidans [25]. 
In laccases, as a general rule, a more hydrophobic axial ligand corresponds to a higher redox potential. Bacterial and plant laccases usually have a Met as the axial ligand for the T1 cupric ion, and share a relatively low redox potential (Eº < +500 mV).

Abstract:  Laccases are blue copper oxidases, found in 
some plants and secreted by a wide range of ligninolytic 
fungi. These enzymes are well known for their ability in oxidizing several organic compounds, mainly phenolics and aromatic amines, at the expenses of molecular 
oxygen. Therefore, they could find application in the 
field of enzymatic bioremediation of many industrial wastewaters, and in particular to bleach and/or detoxify dye-containing effluents. Not all industrial dyes behave as laccase substrates, but this limitation is often overcome by the judicious use of redox mediators. These could substantially widen the application range of laccases as bioremediation tools. The present study encompasses the main properties of the most used industrial dyes as related to their chemical classification, fungal laccases 
and their molecular and catalytic features, the use of 
redox mediators, limitations and perspectives of the use of fungal laccases for industrial dye bleaching.

1  Introduction
1.1  Laccases: a brief overview
Since its discovery at the end of the 19th century in the 
latex of the Japanese lacquer tree [1], the enzyme laccase 
has drawn much attention for its outstanding features. Laccases are found in some higher plants [2,3], but also in certain bacteria [4,5]. However, ligninolytic basidiomycetes 
[6] are the sources of the most studied laccases, usually Review Open Access

laccases have a non-coordinating Leu residue at the axial 
position and show intermediate redox potentials, ranging from about +500 mV to about +700 mV . Finally, high-potential (Eº > +700 mV) laccases (from basidiomycetes) almost invariably bear a non-coordinating Phe residue at 
the axial position [23]. Site-directed mutagenesis on some 
fungal laccases resulted in contrasting effects. Leu/Phe interchange could be without significant electrochemical and kinetic effects (Rhizoctonia solani and Myceliophthora thermophila laccases [26]). In another fungal laccase [27], the changing of Met for Phe resulted in substantial alterations of pH optimum and kinetic constants. In bacterial enzymes, such substitutions could be sometimes favorable [28], whereas in other cases the increase of Eº causes an excessive stabilization of the cuprous state of 
the T1 copper, thus substantially worsening the enzyme 
performances [24,29].
Although the crucial role of the aminoacidic residue in 
the axial position towards the redox potential and reactivity of the T1 cupric ion is firmly established, some other structural factors could exert to a certain extent a small influence towards redox potentials of the T1 cupric ions [30,31].
Once the one-electron oxidation of the substrate is 
accomplished by means of the one-electron reduction of 
the T1 cupric ion to its cuprous counterpart, the oxidized 
state of T1 copper is quickly restored by one-electron transfer to the tricopper cluster [32]. Such a transfer has to be repeated four times to reduce molecular oxygen to two water molecules. In fact, the transfers take place in two steps, each of two electrons, giving rise to a peroxide intermediate, which in turn is reduced to water in the second step, thus regenerating the resting state of the enzyme. Theoretical calculations favor a μ - η
2: η2 arrangement for 
peroxide anion –O–O– positioning between the two cupric 
ions of the T3 dicupric cluster, such as it was found in hemocyanins, tyrosinases, and catecholases. However, this forecast is contradicted by spectroscopic evidence, and the peroxide-tricopper cluster adduct is presumably 
arranged in a μ
3 – 1,1,2 geometry therefore involving the T2 
cupric ion in peroxide ligation. The electron transfer takes 
place through the highly conserved His-Cys-His bridge between T1 and the tricopper cluster [33]. The dioxygen and peroxide ligation to the reduced tricopper cluster is 
irreversible; the ligation geometry when the first two-
electron reduction (to peroxide dianion O
22–) takes place 
does not change substantially.
So, two distinct - although close to each other - sites 
exist within the laccase catalytic center: the T1 cupric ion, devoted to reducing substrate one-electron oxidation, and 
the tricupric cluster which, upon reduction to its cuprous 
state, binds dioxygen.The Eº values deeply influence laccase efficiency 
in oxidizing substrates, being obviously comparatively 
more efficient those with high redox potentials, secreted 
by ligninolytic basidiomycetes, that also show a wider substrate specificity. Heterologous expression of non-secreted but interesting laccases is usually prevented by their glycoprotein nature [34]. Therefore, high-potential, secreted fungal laccases are the best candidates for biotechnological applications.
Fungal laccases usually show activity optima 
within the acidic pH range; however, pH increase favors 
deprotonation of substrates such as phenols (to the 
corresponding phenoxide anions) and aromatic amines (from ammonium salts to the corresponding free bases) that are more easily oxidized. However, the overall efficiency of laccase-catalyzed oxidations is lowered by increasing pH owing to the OH
– ligation to the tricopper 
T2/T3 cluster, therefore hindering the internal electron transfer form the T1 copper to the tricopper cluster [35]. In general, the hydroxide-depending disturbance towards the enzyme activity prevails over the facilitated oxidation 
of substrates upon deprotonation [34]. In principle, 
two distinct mechanisms could operate along laccase catalysis: i) the enzyme abstracts one electron from a lone pair pertaining to a heteroatom (usually oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur), a cation radical arises, which in turn undergoes a nucleophilic attack by H
2O, OH–, or so on (Electron 
Transfer mechanism, ET). In such cases, a second electron could hardly be abstracted from the cation radical, mainly owing to electrostatic reasons, and therefore no quinonoid product could be formed directly. However, at higher 
pH phenolics exist - at least in part - as their phenoxide 
counterparts. In such cases, no cation radicals arise, and neutral delocalized phenoxy radicals are easily produced, which can in turn give rise to oxidative coupling, or disproportionation, or also direct quinonization by means of a second electron abstraction by the enzyme; ii) the enzyme abstracts a hydrogen atom (in fact, one proton and one electron, Hydrogen Atom Transfer mechanism, HAT), from a non-dissociated phenol (at lower pH) or a non-protonated primary or secondary aromatic amine. 
In any case a neutral delocalized radical arises, which is 
further transformed as described above.
Fungal laccases are typically inducible enzymes, 
whose production could be dramatically increased by a variety of small aromatic molecules, sometimes resembling monolignols in chemical structure. A number of different isoenzymes are secreted in response to different inducers [36-41].
Being that laccases are cupro-proteins, copper 
salts under suitable conditions also lead to enhanced

enzyme secretion [42-45]. According to their official 
name, laccases (EC 1.10.3.2 Benzenediol: Oxygen Oxidoreductases, water forming) usually oxidize ortho- and para-diphenols (catechols and quinols, respectively) 
to the corresponding quinones [46-51]. However, generally 
speaking, also monophenols could behave as laccase 
substrates, provided that they bear at least one electron-donating substituent at the ortho or para positions. So, methoxyphenols such as guaiacol (2-methoxyphenol) and hydroquinone monomethylether (4-methoxyphenol) are good laccase substrates. The same considerations could be extended to aromatic amines as well as to aminophenols [52,53]. As noted above, laccases work through a one-electron abstraction (and also one proton could be extracted, depending on the particular substrates 
and the experimental conditions such as pH, vide supra) 
from an electron-rich aromatic substrate, provided that 
the arising radical could delocalize the unpaired electron, giving rise to a relatively stable entity. Such a radical usually evolves further to a more or less complex mixture of coupling, oligomerization, polymerization products, or could disproportionate to the starting substrate and a quinonoid product. The latter could in turn evolve to other products, such as Michael-type addition products with the 
remaining substrate [50,54]. All these possible pathways 
are summarized on Fig. 1.
Obviously, this pattern depends on a number of factors 
(the particular substrate, the pH, and the presence of excess molecular oxygen, among others). And the presence of molecular oxygen is of the greatest importance, since it could perform the dual role of laccase substrate and non-enzymatic reagent towards the free radicals arising from the action of the laccase or otherwise generated [55]. A very complex mixture of reaction products arises, 
comprising hydrogen peroxide, peroxyquinones, oxiranes 
(epoxides), and quinones.In conclusion, laccase specificity is much wider 
than that suggested by its systematic name, as it can very often attack non-phenolic dyes, provided that organic dyes in general are typical for an extended electronic delocalization, in turn allowing the formation 
of delocalized radicals upon one-electron abstraction 
by the enzyme. Such radicals could evolve towards degradation, by following the general criteria outlined above, and according to their particular chemical structure.
1.2   Widening laccase specificity and 
potential use: redox mediators
Laccase-catalyzed oxidation of potential substrates 
is limited by a number of conditions, such as steric hindrance (for macromolecular compounds), very low affinity between the compound and the enzyme active site, and too high redox potential of the putative substrates 
when compared with the oxidizing power of the enzyme. 
Although a noticeable range of redox potential have been calculated for different laccases, and in many cases found to be comparatively high [14,56], still a huge number and variety of compounds remain out of the reach of these enzymes. This obstacle can be overcome in many cases by means of particular substances, usually small, water-soluble molecules, capable of behaving as one-electron shuttles between the enzyme and the to-be-oxidized compounds [57 ,58] (Fig. 1). In more detail, these 
compounds are laccase substrates, whose oxidation 
proceeds as usual with the one electron abstraction. The arising free radicals are long-lived enough to diffuse away from the enzyme active site, and are therefore capable of restoring their stable electronic configurations at the expenses of other substrates [59]. Conceptually, no great difference exists between ‘conventional’ substrates and 
Figure 1: Simplified mechanism of laccase action in the presence and in the absence of redox mediators [54]. Some of the products (i.e. 
polymerized polyphenols) could be in turn laccase substrates.

mediators. However, a mediator stricto sensu is a substrate, 
whose radical is capable of restoring the original electronic configuration at the expenses of another compound, which is usually resistant against the direct action of laccase. These redox mediators (RMs) are well known in Nature, 
and many others have been synthesized. Most of them 
have been studied in detail, and some have been proposed in technological applications. The behavior of RMs is not purely catalytic: the intermediate radicals arising from their enzymatic oxidation can well behave as those arising from ‘conventional’ substrates, therefore disproportionating and affording more or less slowly the (relatively) stable quinonoid product(s). So, in a technological application the chosen RM has to be periodically replenished to obviate the unavoidable oxidation.
Among natural mediators [60], some are certainly 
present in decaying wood, and others are presumably produced by the same fungus that operates the rotting process. Most are phenolics, already well known as laccase substrates, and therefore they are rapidly quinonized by the enzyme. So, they undergo fast consumption and have to be continually replaced, unless they are naturally present or also formed in suitable amounts along laccase action. Some simple phenolics have been studied and described in detail as laccase RMs: p-hydroxybenzyl alcohol, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillin, acetovanillone, 
syringaldehyde, acetosyringone, syringic acid, p-coumaric, ferulic, and sinapic acids (Fig. 2) [61,62].
In particular, phenolics combining the presence of a 
p-substitution (such as –CHO, –COOH, –CH=CH–COOH) with two o,o’ methoxyls, are good laccase substrates but cannot dimerize or polymerize (unless decarboxylation, demethoxylation, or oxidative coupling – in the case of cinnamic derivatives – takes place), and moreover their quinonization is comparatively difficult, for the same reasons. Therefore, such compounds are among the most efficient phenolic-type RMs [63-65]. A particular case is that of o-hydroxyanthranilic (2-amino-3-hydroxybenzoic) 
acid, a simple o-aminophenol secreted by the white-
rot fungus Pycnoporus cinnabarinus, which mediates lignin degradation by the fungal laccase, being at the same time slowly and irreversibly converted to its phenoxazone derivative, cinnabarinic acid [66]. However, hydroxyanthranilic acid, although effective in lignin degradation by P. cinnabarinus, is comparatively weak 
with respect to other RMs.

Figure 3: Phenol red is a synthetic phenolic compound, effectively 
used as laccase redox mediator.
Many artificial compounds have been tested as potential 
RMs, and for many of them a noticeable effectiveness has been assessed. In particular, ABTS has been the first synthetic molecule for which a RM role has been shown [58]. Among synthetic phenolics, Phenol Red (a 
sulfophthalein, Fig. 3) has proved to be effective as a RM 
[67]. Hydroxylamine derivatives, all sharing the presence of a >N–OH moiety, have become highly popular as RMs for laccase industrial applications, as they are readily available at reasonable prices. Their main drawbacks are the well-known toxicity and their tendency to act as laccase inhibitors [60]. Fig. 4 presents the most used NOH-type RMs.
TEMPO (and analogues) is a quite particular case: it 
is a stable >N–O∙ radical, which is oxidized by laccase to the corresponding oxoimmonium cation. This acts by following an ionic mechanism [68-71]. These RMs share with the phenolic ones the HAT action mechanism [72,73] (Fig. 5), contrary to what is observed for ABTS which typically acts through an ET mechanism [74] (Fig. 6). The two mechanisms could sometimes be differentiated by using proper substrates that yield different products [75,76]. Interestingly, synergistic effects have been 
observed when two RMs with different (HAT or ET) 
mechanisms are used together [77 ,78].

1.3   Organic industrial dyes: molecular 
motifs, general reactivity
Industrial dyes constitute an enormous class of 
compounds, mainly organic, whose sole common feature is the absorption of visible light. Obviously, this feature is not enough, taken alone, to classify an organic, colored compound as a dye. In fact, a dye must be capable of 
conferring its color to a substrate to be dyed, such as 
fabrics, or plastics, or also foodstuff. Ideally, the obtained coloration should be stable in time, resistant against washings, and unaltered upon prolonged exposure to solar (or also artificial) light. Organic dyes are almost invariably aromatic compounds, showing extended electronic delocalization along π orbitals. Electronic delocalization of the chromophoric moiety of the dye molecule is reinforced by the presence, in suitable positions, of auxochromic/bathochromic groups such as 
hydroxy-, methoxy-, amino-, dimethylamino-groups and 
so on. Industrially relevant dyes should be inert enough against physical, chemical, and biological degradation, to show a proper durability under the application conditions.
A detailed discussion about structures and syntheses 
of industrial dyes is far beyond the scope of this paper; however, a brief description of the main classes of the relevant structures and main properties of these compounds could be useful for the readership and is 
therefore presented in the next chapter, which is mainly 
focused on the textile dyes.
1.3.1  Textile dyes in wastewaters
A huge amount of dyes are unavoidably released in 
wastewaters as a result of dyeing processes, adopted in textile plants [79]. Over 10,000 tons of dyes are produced every year [80] with quite low yields of textile processes (the percentage of the lost dye in the effluents can reach up to 50% [81]). Even greater amounts of water are consumed along the dyeing and washing processes (up to 200 L per Kg of textile fabricated, making the dye industry one of the most water-consuming sectors [82,83]). So a serious problem arises, of relatively low concentrations of dyes, contained in large volumes of water. Usually, no re-use of 
wastewater is performed [83], posing a serious issue about 
the economical and environmental sustainability of the processes (in fact water supplies are dropping, increasing its market price (up to almost 6 €/m
3 in the European 
Community [83]). Furthermore, the visual impact of the presence of dyes in wastewaters is high towards the public, so a high pressure towards textile plants and authorities involved in environmental defense has led 
to the development of an exceptionally high number of 
different methods, aimed to solve the problem of water bodies pollution by textile dyes [79,84-86].
These include biological, physical, and chemical 
approaches [82,84,87-89]. However, all of the methods suffer from significant drawbacks still affecting the economical feasibility of the processes. For instance, the common biological activated sludge treatment does not provide the flexibility required by the continuous differences in textile wastes composition [82,90]. On 
the other hand, the displacement of secondary waste 
produced by coagulation and adsorption techniques is sometimes less sustainable than the original wastewater [91]. Whereas, the chemical approaches usually suffer from high costs and low efficiency.
Textile dyes are usually water-soluble, or at least could 
be transiently changed into soluble derivatives that are in turn re-insolubilized and precipitated onto or within the fibers to be dyed, usually by means of a reduction (with 
sodium dithionite) followed by a re-oxidation (with air).

Therefore, the dyeing baths as well as the washing waters 
contain more or less elevated concentrations of dyes that should be removed before the wastes are funneled into receiving water bodies.
Given the extreme structural heterogeneity of the 
chemical structures of the hundreds of commonly used textile dyes, several methods should be kept under consideration when planning a treatment protocol for a particular textile wastewater, owing to the different reactivity of the different compounds.
In the present context, a very concise review of the 
main chemical classes of important dyes could be useful to the readership, which is directed to comprehensive reviews if necessary [84,92,93]. A reasonable knowledge of the fundamental structural motifs present in the different 
classes of the examined dyes could help with forecasting 
the pros and cons of the existing treatment protocols, or envisaging new ones.
Azo dyes are among the most used, as they are 
effective, stable, and inexpensive. The general structure of an azo dye R
1–N=N–R2 gives evidence to the azo chromophore –N=N–, which is responsible for the main properties of the class [94]. R
1 and R2 are aromatic (or 
heteroaromatic) moieties [95], where R1 brings electron-
withdrawing substituents whereas R2 bears electron-
releasing substituents. Electronic delocalization of an extended π system, also possibly involving the peripheral substituents, causes the compounds to strongly absorb visible light. The azo chromophore is per se an electron-
withdrawing moiety (–I effect), although it possesses two lone pairs suitable for interactions with the adjacent aromatic systems (+M effect). When the substituents on the R
2 ring are –OH and/or –NH2, the corresponding 
dye can exist in a protonated (–OH and/or –NH3+) or an 
unprotonated form (–O– and/or –NH2), depending on pH. 
The alternative forms usually show different colors, and therefore could work as pH indicators. In many azo dyes, R
2 also contains electron-withdrawing substituents such 
as –SO3– besides the electron-donating ones. The purpose 
of the sulfonic substituent is to confer solubility in water to the compound. Some prominent examples of azo dyes are encompassed in Fig. 7 .

9,10-Anthraquinone is the parent compound of a 
wide range of natural dyes and also of synthetic dyes, 
usually containing electron-donating substituents [96]. The iconic compound of this class is alizarin (1,2-dihydroxyanthraquinone) found in madder (Rubia 
tinctorum). A hydroxy and/or amino substituent should 
occupy the α position with respect to the carbonyl groups, to ensure the maximum overlap of the π orbitals and therefore the best tinctorial properties. On the whole, although typical for their light fastness and brightness, anthraquinone dyes are usually more costly and therefore cannot compete with the azo dyes. A selection of well-known anthraquinone dyes is presented in Fig. 8.
Indigoid dyes owe their name to indigo, obtained from 
the plant Indigofera tinctoria, which is the main source of 
‘natural’ indigo [97]. Another famous dye is the imperial 
or Tyrian purple, which is 6,6’-dibromoindigo [98]. These dyes are in fact insoluble pigments, which need to be reduced to soluble leuco-compounds, and re-oxidized in turn by air directly on the fibers (vat dyes).
Simple indigoids are exceptionally inert and durable 
upon exposure to heating, sunlight, and extreme pH, although they can undergo both reversible reduction and oxidation under proper conditions. Synthetic indigo is largely used to dye denim fabric. Some outstanding indigoids are summarized in Fig. 9.
Cationic dyes are molecules, whose positive charge 
is an essential part of their chromophores; very different cationic dyes also exist, whose positive charge is not involved in the chromophoric delocalized electron system, so their cationic nature is only relevant to impart solubility in water and preferential adsorption on negatively charged fibers. Obviously, cationic dyes are a rather heterogeneous class of substances, owing to the very different chromophores they show.
Cyanine dyes are cationic substances containing 
polymethine bridges between two nitrogen atoms with 
a delocalized positive charge. The number of carbon 
atoms forming the bridge may vary within a wide range, thus extending the charge delocalization. Also, one or both nitrogen atoms can be part of cyclic or polycyclic structures, further expanding the structural variety of this dye class. Consequently, a huge number of cyanine dyes exist, with shades ranging from deep blue to

as cyclic cyanine dyes where the methine bridge is 
incorporated within an aromatic ring. They could also be considered as delocalized triphenylmethyl cations. Some important triphenylmethane-based dyes are illustrated in Fig. 11.
Similarly, diphenylmethane-based cationic dyes have 
been considered as benzophenoneimine derivatives. When a nitrogen atom bridges the two aromatic rings, acridines are obtained; when the bridging atom is oxygen or sulfur, xanthenes or thiaxanthenes, respectively, are formed as is shown in Fig. 12. Other cationic dyes, also belonging to the cyanine family, are derived from phenazine, phenoxazine, and phenothiazine. Some outstanding examples of these are shown in Fig. 13. Some comprehensive discussions about the above mentioned cationic dyes are available 
[94,101,102].
Phthalocyanine dyes are macrocycles [103] usually 
obtained starting from o-phthalonitrile. Despite a 
feeble resemblance with porphyrins, these dyes sharply differ from the latter for being exceptionally stable compounds. Phthalocyanines are usually applied as the corresponding metal complexes, usually with cupric ions. green to yellow to red and purple. The fluorescence of many cyanine dyes widens their fields of application to photography, biotechnology, and lasers [99,100]. Some cyanine-based structures are depicted in Fig. 10.
Triphenylmethane cationic dyes, once referred to as 
fuchsoneimine derivatives, are more properly regarded

Copper phthalocyanine is a quite useful pigment, very 
stable against heating, sunlight, and harsh washings. Phthalocyanines (and their metal complexes) are completely water insoluble, and should be regarded as pigments rather than dyes stricto sensu. However, water-
soluble phthalocyanine dyes are well known, bearing 
solubilizing moieties such as the sulfonate anion –SO
3–. 
Relevant phthalocyanines are depicted in Fig. 14.
Sulfur dyes are obtained by heating suitable aromatics 
or heterocycles with sulfur or compounds capable of releasing sulfur upon heating. From the obtained melts the 
dyes can be extracted, showing non-definite structures. 
Sulfur atoms could be part of newly formed heterocyclic structures, and/or also constitute thiol, sulfide, or polysulfide moieties [104]. Very often sulfur dyes must be solubilized by reduction under alkaline conditions, to afford the corresponding thiolates; these are reoxidized by air thus giving the insoluble dye. Differently from other dye classes, univocal identification of a definite chromophore in sulfur dyes is usually impossible. Some 
sulfur dyes are shown in Fig. 15.

1.4   Fungal laccases within the frame of 
white rot fungi metabolism
Although laccases have been found in many fungi and 
also in bacteria, higher plants, and insects [34], they are typical for white-rot fungi [105-107]. These are the sole family of fungi capable of efficiently degrading lignin [108]. Lignin biosynthesis, structure, and function have 
been encompassed in some reviews [109-113]. Lignin is a very complex heteropolymer obtained by oxidative 
polymerization of the so-called monolignols (Fig. 16). A 3D lattice, very compact and rather hydrophobic, is obtained, where the monomeric units are mainly linked by means 
of C–C bonds and aryl ether functions (Fig. 17). Therefore, 
lignins are completely resistant towards hydrolysis, but can be gradually fragmented and solubilized by means of an enzymatic/non-enzymatic pathway, requiring some fungal enzymes, such as high-potential heme peroxidases (Lignin peroxidase EC 1.11.1.14, Manganese peroxidase EC 1.11.1.13, Versatile peroxidase EC 1.11.1.16) and laccase. White-rot fungi have been classified on the basis of the ligninolytic enzymatic patterns they express when growing on lignocellulosics [114], and laccase is generally 
believed to exert a key role in oxidative ligninolysis 
[5,16,108,115-120]. 
Among the known ligninolytic enzymes in white-rot 
fungi, laccases are by far the most widespread and the most manageable [121], contrary to peroxidases, which suffer for an exaggerated sensitivity to their substrate hydrogen peroxide, easily leading to irreversible enzyme inactivation [17 ,122-124], suggesting the use of biomimetic catalysts in their stead [125-127]. Therefore, the fact that 
a relatively low number of studies are devoted to the use

of fungal peroxidases in delignification technology and 
bioremediation processes is not surprising [128-131]. Also the need for more expensive hydrogen peroxide as the oxidizing agent, whereas laccases use the inexpensive oxygen from air, has to be taken into account to explain 
the sharp prevalence of laccase-based processes.
Laccase alone in vitro appears on the whole as 
incapable of promoting lignin oxidative breakdown, 
and on the contrary it seems capable of triggering a further polymerization amongst native lignin molecules [132]. Laccase attacks the peripheral regions of lignin macromolecules, where it specifically oxidizes phenolic units to the corresponding phenoxy radicals (Hydrogen Atom Transfer mechanism, HAT, also extensible to primary –NH
2 and secondary –NHR amines, vide infra); these are 
most probably responsible for the observed polymerization reactions. In fact, laccase action towards lignin is rather complex [133,134] and a partial depolymerization also takes place (Fig. 18). It is commonly believed that laccase is 
particularly effective in oxidative degradation of relatively 
simple phenolics, arising from oxidative breakdown of the native lignin molecules, in turn caused by other enzymes such as high-potential fungal peroxidases, and/or by the intervention of ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) formed as the result of direct, non-enzymic interactions between phenoxy radicals and excess molecular oxygen.As an iconic example, vanillic (4-hydroxy-3-
methoxybenzoic) acid gives rise to a number of oxidation products [135] such as methoxy-1,4-benzoquinone, and degradation products of 1,2-benzoquinone-4-carboxylic acid (Fig. 19). In other words, quinonization goes together with oxidative demethoxylation and/or decarboxylation.
Then, the crucial question is: why is laccase capable 
of delignification in vivo, whereas its action is rather disappointing in vitro? The answer most probably resides 
in the existence of some quinone-recycling fungal 
enzymes, localized within the periplasmic membranes, 
and NAD(P)H-dependent [136-138]. The arising quinols are quickly re-oxidized by laccase, giving rise to phenoxy radicals that are in turn efficient sources of ROS (the true responsible species for lignin oxidative fragmentation).
In conclusion, laccase is able to perform several 
different reactions (compare also Fig. 1) that can find useful technological application. Laccase versatility is often further increased by non-enzymatic action of 
molecular oxygen and its reactive derivatives, and very 
notably by the judicious use of RMs. Among the large range of laccase substrates undoubtedly are industrial dyes, as demonstrated by the huge number of theoretical and applicative studies dealing with dye oxidative bleaching upon laccase catalysis. The next section introduces dyes as substrates for laccases.

2  Industrial dyes as ‘direct’ laccase 
substrates
As noted above, dye molecules generally bear one or more 
auxochromic/bathochromic groups, namely –OH, –OCH3, 
–NH2, –N(CH3)2, –NH–C6H5, and so on, directly bound to 
an aromatic ring, with the aim of increasing the ε values and at the same time of shifting the λ
max well within the 
visible range. As both oxygen and nitrogen are more electronegative than carbon, these substituents show a feeble –I action, that is largely overcome by a +M effect, arising from the presence of lone pairs on the heteroatoms. 
So, when the dye also shows a net positive charge, usually 
an electron-rich region exists in the molecule, which is capable, under proper conditions, of losing one electron (eventually also one proton), giving rise to a radical. The further fate of such a radical depends on the particular dye considered, on the pH, on the presence and concentration of molecular oxygen. The agent, capable of performing such an electron abstraction could well be a fungal laccase, as demonstrated by a huge number of studies, dealing with industrial dye bleaching by fungal laccases 
[79,80,85,139-159].
2.1  Degradation of azo dyes
As noted in § 1.1.1, azo dyes almost invariably contain 
at least one phenolic or amine substituent, bound to one of the two aromatic systems linked by the –N=N– group. This electron-rich portion of the dye molecule would be the target of the laccase action. The main aim 
of dye-containing wastewater treatment with laccase (or 
any other method to decolorize such wastewater) is just decolorization, so not many studies are dedicated to the intimate mechanism(s) of dye oxidative degradation. However, some detailed degradation pathways have been proposed for selected azo dyes, that could well be extended to this enormous dye family. Both bacterial and fungal laccases were tested, and the obtained results speak strongly in favor of a common mechanism, starting with one-electron abstraction by laccase from the electron-rich 
aromatic ring of the dye [160-162]. 
In particular, a series of dyes, sharing the sulfonate 
anion as the electron-withdrawing substituent in the para 
position, and the phenolic nature of the electron-rich aromatic ring, were tested as substrates of a laccase from the plant pathogenic fungus Pyricularia (Magnaporthe) oryzae. As a general result, the cleavage of the dye molecules was observed, at the bond linking the azo chromophore and the phenolic ring. In the presence of chloro- or nitro- substituents on the phenolic ring, no degradation at all was observed. After oxidation of the dye substrates, the electron-rich aromatic (phenolic) ring 
was found as the corresponding para-quinone (and/or 
its degradation products) whereas elemental nitrogen was evolved and the sulfobenzene ring was released as the para-hydroperoxy-benzenesulfonic acid and its degradation products (Fig. 20).
Figure 20: The reported reaction of the best substrate (2,6-dime-
thoxy-4-(4’-sulfophenylazo)-phenol) among the 4-sulfophenylazo dye family studied by Chivukula and coworkers [160].
Noticeably, oxidative cleavage of the studied dyes largely 
prevailed over oxidative coupling/polymerization [160]. In a somewhat similar study, two other azo dyes were studied [162], sharing the presence of the meta-benzenesulfonic moiety as the electron-poor portion of the dye molecules. 
The electron-rich portions were 4-dimethylaminobenzene 
or 2-hydroxynaphthalene, respectively. The laccase used came from the ligninolytic fungus Trametes villosa. The degradation pathway mainly paralleled that described above, but with the noticeable difference that a substantial fraction of the degradation products polymerize, also retaining the azo group (Fig. 21).
Figure 21: The degradation pathway of a laccase from ligninolytic 
fungus Trametes villosa, using a sulfophenylazo dye. In this case a substantial fraction of the degradation products polymerizes, also retaining the azo group [162].
The Authors therefore concluded that laccases are not 
suitable on the whole for the bioremediation of azo dyes. Another study on 19 azo dyes [161] showed that a recombinant bacterial laccase (CotA-Laccase, Bacillus subtilis) was able to efficiently degrade the majority of

the tested dyes, with the exception of reactive Yellow 81. 
This azo dye is however rather far from the ‘conventional’ azo dye structure, as it lacks the electron-rich moieties that are the preferred attack point for laccases. The fate of Sudan Orange G, which on the contrary has a very simple 
and ‘conventional’ structure, has been studied in detail. 
The degradation mechanism is still the same, leading to hydroxy-p-benzoquinone, benzene, phenol, and a polymer mixture of compounds, still retaining the azo moiety (Fig. 22). So, in this case the bioremediating power of laccase seems at least debatable. 
Figure 22: A recombinant bacterial laccase (CotA-Laccase, Bacillus 
subtilis) was able to efficiently degrade the majority of the tested azo dyes. The degradation mechanism is still the same, leading to a mixture of other products deriving from the transient o-naphtho-quinone through oxidative coupling with both the starting dye and 3-hydroxy-benzenesulfonic acid [161].
A comprehensive, simplified scheme of the general 
degradation pathway is presented in Fig. 23. It is worth noting that amino azo dyes should follow an asymmetrical cleavage of the molecule, paralleling that observed in the case of phenolic azo dyes, and leaving the azo 
chromophore linked to the electron-poor aromatic ring, 
as a quite transient phenylazene derivative. The amine-bearing ring should afford a quinoneimine, which upon hydrolysis should afford ammonia and the corresponding benzoquinone.
Somewhat surprisingly, an asymmetrical cleavage 
opposite to that commonly observed, and leaving the azo chromophore linked to the dimethylaminophenyl moiety (under the form of the quite elusive 4-dimethylaminophenyl diazene [163]) has been reported as the cleavage product 
upon laccase action, starting from methyl orange [164,165].
Unlike laccase, ligninolytic peroxidases are able to 
achieve both symmetrical and asymmetrical cleavage 
paths (Fig. 24) [166]. This (apparent) difference is due to the sharply acidic pH values needed for peroxidase action. Under such conditions, a radical cation is formed, whose positive charge could be delocalized involving also the azo chromophore. Therefore this undergoes nucleophilic attack by water and subsequent hydrolysis, affording a 
nitroso derivative and an iminoquinone (and their further 
reaction products). Anyway, such a symmetrical cleavage mechanism could not be definitely ruled out in the case 
of laccase action, at least when working at low pH values.
It is worth noting that hydroxy- and amino- azo 
dyes could be oxidatively degraded upon bioinspired 
catalysis with redox-active metalloporphines and suitable oxidants. Also in this case, only asymmetrical mechanisms have been described [167]. However, in the case of the amino compounds, additional reactions (oxidative dealkylation of secondary and tertiary amines, followed by further oxidation giving the corresponding nitroso derivatives) take place, leading to condensation 
and/or oligomerization reactions that finally afford 
polyazo dyes, more recalcitrant than the parent dyes [167]. Therefore, although redox-active metalloporphines could oxidize a wider range of azo dyes than laccases can, such bioinspired catalysts often lead to worsening rather that solving of the problem.
Azo dyes can undergo the action of the rather 
non-specific enzymes azo reductases [94,168]. As a result of the action of azo reductases, the azo bridge is 
broken down and two arylamines arise. These are often 
carcinogenic, and usually more toxic than the dye that precedes them. Fortunately, such amines are good laccase substrates. Therefore, they are transiently changed into the corresponding quinoneimines, affording - upon hydrolysis - in turn quinones and/or their degradation/oxidation products.
2.2  Degradation of anthraquinone dyes
Anthraquinone itself is a rather unreactive molecule. Conversely, its hydroxy- and/or amino-derivatives could undergo a number of reactions, including oxidation, as is common knowledge. As expected, hydroxyanthraquinones can undergo oxidation by peroxidases [169] although 
sometimes oxidative coupling rather than cleavage 
takes place [170]. Hydroxy- and amino-anthraquinones basically behave as phenols and aromatic amines, although their reactivity is somewhat weakened by the electron-withdrawing power of the two carbonyl moieties. Nevertheless, in several cases they have proven to be good laccase substrates [171-174]. A comparative study about different fungi (Pleurotus ostreatus vs. Phanerochaete chrysosporium) showed that Pleurotus was sharply more efficient [175] in bleaching synthetic dyes dissolved in the 
culture broth, most probably owing to its higher laccase 
secretion than Phanerochaete. However, such efficiency dropped down when the culture filtrate was separated from the hyphae, therefore confirming the intervention of membrane-bound enzyme(s) helping laccase in its bleaching action. Such enzymes have been identified as

NAD(P)H-dependent quinone reductases [137 ,138,176]. 
Quinones arising from laccase action are reduced to the corresponding quinols. These could be re-oxidized by laccase, or undergo direct (auto)oxidation by molecular oxygen, thus generating Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) 
that are the true agents of dye bleaching (Fig. 25). This latter 
rapid (auto)oxidation is a typical feature of anthraquinols (as a point of fact, the industrial preparation of hydrogen peroxide is just based on re-oxidation of 3-methyl-anthraquinol to the corresponding anthraquinone by molecular oxygen).
Also aminoanthraquinones and aminohydroxyan-
thraquinones behave as substrates for laccase(s) and are therefore bleached with high efficiency [153,177]. A study on a laccase from Lentinus sp. showed that the enzyme 
could efficiently bleach both azo and aminoanthraqui-
none dyes. In this study, modeling calculations assessed the enzyme-substrate interactions at the active site [178].
2.3  Degradation of cyanine dyes
As underlined above (§ 1.1.1.) cyanine dyes are a very heterogeneous dye class, sharing a delocalized positive charge that confers them a cationic character, so they could well be defined as basic dyes. However, the dye net charge could be annihilated or also reverted by sulfonation 
that introduces one or more –SO
3– groups. These have a 
marginal impact on the dye hue, but increase solubility 
in water and change the tinctorial features, so sulfonated cyanine dyes are not uncommon at all. As a general rule, basic dyes should pose a challenge to bleaching by laccases: the enzyme should extract a negatively charged entity (one electron) from a positively charged molecule. Despite such a conjecture, many basic dyes are substrates 
for laccases, and are therefore bleached. Among the 
thionines (Fig. 13), methylene blue, the fully methylated member of the series, is not an ideal substrate for all the tested laccases [143,179,180]. These observations are not surprising: the dye has no –OH or –NH
2 groups, so no 
hydrogen atom could be abstracted from the molecule (HAT mechanism). Only a non-bonding electron could be drawn from a –N(CH
3)2 group or also from the nitrogen 
and sulfur atoms incorporated in the thiazine ring (ET mechanism), therefore adding a supplementary positive charge to the dye cation. 
Sharply different is the general behavior of the very 
similar dye, Azure B (identical to Methylene Blue, except for having three methyl groups only and therefore a –NHCH
3 instead of a –N(CH3)2). In this case, a more efficient 
bleaching has been described in the presence of different laccases. Most probably, Azure B degradation starts with the abstraction of the hydrogen of the –NHCH
3 group of 
the dye, producing a radical species, where the positive charge of the molecule was not increased by the laccase(s) [181-183] (Fig. 26): at least in this case, HAT seems to be more favorable than ET. A similar mechanism could occur 
in the presence of lignin peroxidases and their biomimetic 
counterparts [184,185].
Conversely, the cationic dye Phenosafranine 
(Fig. 13) seems not to be a substrate for laccase from Pleurotus at all [86,186], whereas it is bleached by lignin peroxidase.
Figure 25: The mechanism for anthraquinone dyes involves an apparently futile cycle with ROS production, which seem to be the true agent 
of the bleaching. The presence of fungal membrane-bound NAD(P)H-reductases in combination with laccase is mandatory for the completion of the cycle. In the absence of reductase activity, the oxidative action of laccase drops, probably stopping at a quinone intermediate.

2.4   Degradation of triphenylmethane dyes
Among triphenylmethane dyes (Fig. 11) phthaleins, 
although poorly significant as industrial dyes, have been tested as laccase substrates. An outstanding example is that of the well-known pH indicator and electrophoresis marker and stain, bromophenol blue, which is 
bleached [187]. On the other hand, nitrogen-containing 
triphenylmethane dyes (Fig. 11) could be well regarded as a particular class of cyanines. They could be considered as virtually based on the fundamental structure of parafuchsine (pararosaniline) hydrochloride, to which methyl groups are bound directly to the free positions on the phenyl rings, or on the amine nitrogen atoms, or also on both, therefore forming a number of dyes, whose colors range from magenta to purple to blue till dark violet. In some cases, sulfonate groups are also introduced 
by sulfonation, giving rise to ‘acid’ triphenylmethane 
dyes. However, sulfonation does not abolish the typical positive net charge, delocalized along the three amine substituents. Basic triphenylmethane dyes are widely used owing to their brilliant hues and relatively low cost; many of them have been described as laccase substrates [179,188-192]. 
Some general conclusions can be drawn by the cited 
studies: among the triphenylmethane dyes, bromophenol 
blue is degraded rather easily, most probably because 
of the lack of any positive charge, which opposes electron abstraction by the enzyme; crystal violet, with its quaternized ammonium substituent, is the most recalcitrant because of the difficult abstraction of an electron from a cation. A deeper insight in the oxidative bleaching mechanism [193] revealed that almost invariably, the triphenylmethane moiety is cleaved at the central carbon atom. First of all, two series of experiments were conducted, one with the dyes dissolved in the culture media of actively growing Trametes versicolor, and the other on the same dyes with the purified laccase coming from the same fungus. T. versicolor was able to adsorb and 
beach all the tested dyes, with sharp preferences for the 
acid ones, which were quickly decolorized, without any adverse effect towards the fungus. The basic dyes on the contrary proved to be toxic to the fungus, thus inhibiting biomass production and mycelium development almost completely. Nevertheless, if the concentrations of the basic, toxic dyes were not too high, the fungus was able to degrade and bleach them. Obviously, bleaching of the triphenylmethane dyes by T. versicolor cannot be attributed to laccase alone, due to the presence of a rich enzyme 
arsenal within the fungal cells. All the studied dyes were 
also treated with the purified T. versicolor laccase. Quite 
different results were obtained: for example, acid fuchsine was resistant against enzymic bleaching, and was only slowly and partly degraded. The strong –I effect of the sulfonate substituents most probably prevents any electron abstraction from the dye molecule, thus suggesting the intervention of another enzymatic activity (i.e. high-potential ligninolytic peroxidase(s)) when decolorization 
was performed in the presence of actively growing 
mycelium. As a general rule, all the tested dyes caused a drastic deactivation of the enzyme within 24  hours of incubation, therefore suggesting the intermediacy of very reactive species along the degradation process, leading to irreversible enzyme inhibition.
Figure 26: Thionine dyes can be bleached by both ET and HAT mechanism. The presence of a secondary amine group in Azure B allows for 
HAT mechanism. This is indeed more favorable, not increasing the charge of the molecule.

2.5  Degradation of phthalocyanine dyes
Phthalocyanine dyes (mainly Cu-phthalocyanines) are 
particularly recalcitrant substances; however, some industrially relevant, water-soluble derivatives could be bleached by fungal laccases. This is the case of Reactive Blue 25, containing a Cu-phthalocyanine macrocycle 
(the chromophore) and a monochlorotriazine moiety 
(the reactive tether), which is at first adsorbed and then bleached by the mycelium of Aspergillus ochraceus NCIM-1146. It is worth noting that in this case laccase is accompanied by lignin peroxidase, so uncertainty exists about the role of the former in the degradation [194].
In another study some soluble Cu-phthalocyanines 
were at first adsorbed and then degraded by the iconic ligninolytic fungus, Phanerochaete chrysosporium. The dyes were demetallated by the intervention of 
manganese peroxidase, whereas laccase broke down the 
phthalocyanine macrocycle, leading to intermediates, that were in turn changed into simpler compounds, also comprising phthalimide [195].
It is also worth noting that in several cases no purified 
laccase was used, and bleaching experiments were carried out by adding the chosen dye to the culture media of the ligninolytic fungi. However, in all cited experiments, the bleaching effect of the studied fungi was clearly 
related to laccase production and secretion. The possible 
intervention of enzymes other than laccases should also be considered when working with cultured fungi and/or culture filtrates. Manganese peroxidase appears as a quite effective potential ancillary tool for laccase-assisted oxidative degradation [158].
3  Redox mediators allow laccases 
to bleach recalcitrant dyes
As noted above (§ 1.2) many industrial dyes are out of 
the reach of laccases, due to different factors such as too high redox potential, steric hindrance, lack of molecular motifs recognizable by the enzymes. In several cases, the problem of dye inertness when treated with laccases could 
be solved by the use of RMs.  Moreover, RMs could also 
substantially enhance the bleaching efficiency for dyes that are per se (poor) laccase substrates. 
The use of ABTS as a RM has resulted in several studies 
assessing its efficiency in dye bleaching and detoxification, as found in a combined treatment scheme adopted to remediate a real dye mill effluent [196]. In another study [197] the suitability of a bacterial laccase as a tool for azo dye decolorization was assessed in the presence of the RMs ABTS, acetosyringone, syringaldehyde, and N-hydroxybenzotriazole. A copper phthalocyanine dye was efficiently bleached, and the degradation products characterized, by a recombinant fungal laccase, in the 
presence of ABTS [198].
Another recombinant laccase (CotA laccase from 
Bacillus pumilus), remarkable for its high stability and 
activity at alkaline pH, proved to be much more efficient in the presence of the RM methyl syringate [172]. The enzyme was capable of bleaching Reactive Red 11, Reactive Blue 171 (azo dyes) and Reactive Blue 4, Reactive Brilliant Blue (anthraquinone dyes). A laccase secreted by Pycnoporus sanguineus decolorized some dyes in the presence of violuric acid and, better, methyl syringate [199]. The 
general properties of methyl syringate as laccase RM have 
been recently reviewed [200].
Among the >N–OH RMs, hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT) 
has a prominent role; the influence of benzene ring substituents towards efficiency in different HBTs has been recently reviewed [201]. HBT is very popular among >N–OH RMs due to its high efficiency [202-207]. 
In conclusion, the use of properly chosen RMs 
decidedly widens the application field of laccases in 
dye degradation/bleaching, and this is crucial when 
managing dyes, that are not ‘direct’ laccase substrates. However, the use of RMs represents an additional cost, in particular when poorly stable RMs are used, leading to inactive oxidation products. Finally, when using very toxic RMs, their persistence in the bleached wastewaters should be considered.
4  Open problems and perspectives
The problem of laccase and/or RMs waste when treating industrial wastewaters has noticeable economical concerns, as enzymes are generally costly and moreover are more or less quickly inactivated. Therefore, immobilization procedures could help solve these 
drawbacks, allowing enzyme and/or mediator recovery 
and recycling [208-214]. Adsorption is the most immediate approach for enzymatic immobilization, not involving the use of toxic reagents or complex chemical reactions [215]. However, adsorbing materials in principle are not the first choice for laccase immobilization: non-specific adsorptive properties would allow also dye adsorption, thus nullifying the bleaching power of the enzyme. On the other hand, laccases are usually immobilized with high yields on solid supports, provided that covalent linkages 
are formed between the enzyme and the chosen support, 
and many of such preparations have been described

as capable of efficiently degrading industrial dyes [216-
223]. The most useful and popular methods for covalent immobilization of enzymes have been recently described and reviewed [208].
Immobilization of RMs could in principle help 
with recovering these compounds, but the drawback of mass transfer issues makes this approach almost useless. However, a very recent study [224] deals with substituted anthraquinones as RMs, covalently bound to carbon-based materials. In that study, 4-nitrophenol was reduced by sodium sulfide, thanks to the anthraquinone intermediacy. The study has nothing to do with enzymes, but could represent a starting point for future developments in that direction.
In conclusion, a judicious choice of both the particular 
laccase and the support for immobilization could afford tailor-made preparations, suitable for particular dyes to be bleached. Addition of RMs to the reaction mixtures could substantially enhance the bleaching rates and efficiencies. 
Another novel strategy to improve the efficiency of 
the laccase-based treatments of textile dyes (especially in the perspective of decreasing economical impact of the whole process) is the heterologous production of 
recombinant laccases. Several attempts have been recently 
accomplished with promising results [150,161,188,198,225]. However, the presence of post-translation modifications (particularly, glycosylation) should be taken in due care, to obtain a fully functional enzyme.
