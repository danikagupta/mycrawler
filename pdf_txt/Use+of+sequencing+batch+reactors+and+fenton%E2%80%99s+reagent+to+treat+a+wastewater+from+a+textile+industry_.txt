The speciality chemical process requires large volumes of water of high purity and generates equally
large volumes of wastewater. The generated wastewater is complex and highly variable with respect toits nature, containing high levels of chemical oxygen demand (COD), dissolved and suspended solids, amedium to low level of biochemical oxygen demand, a considerable amount of total organic halogen andan intense colour. In the present study the actual efﬂuent was collected from the organic industry andvarious experiments were conducted to reduce the pollution load and reuse treated wastewater.
The wastewater typically contains COD about 48,000 mg L
−1. When it was distilled, the COD of the
condensate reduces to 17,000 mg L−1which was subjected to electrolytic degradation and subsequently
biological oxidation. The operation was continued using various microorganisms such as Bacillus subtilis ,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris in a batch reactor. Minimum of 80% reduction of COD was
obtained in the combined process.

1. Introduction
The efﬁcient amputations of refractory or recalcitrant com-
pounds present in organic industrial efﬂuents are still a majorenvironmental challenge. Refractory or recalcitrant compounds inthis context are those, which resist aerobic microbial degrada-tion in natural environment and conventional biological treatmentprocesses. A literature survey shows that research continues tobe conducted in the areas of chemical and combined chemi-cal biological treatments in order to improve the biodegradationof recalcitrant compounds and minimize the sludge production.Many of the refractory or recalcitrant compounds are carcinogenic,mutagenic and detrimental to the environment. As toxicity stan-dards have turn out to be more stringent, the development ofnew techniques for minimizing the concentration of bio refractorycompounds and their breakdown products in the wastewater hasbecome necessary. Protection of human health and the environ-ment is now perceived as more important than the proﬁtabilityand efﬁciency of a business.
The speciality chemical process requires large volumes of high
purity water and generates equally large volumes of wastewater.

chemical oxygen demand (COD), dissolved and suspended solids, amedium to low level of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), a con-siderable amount of total organic halogen and an intense colour.Hence, the need for chemical treatment is necessary in order toproduce a more readily biodegradable compound. Treatment tech-nologies, which are discussed in the literature, include ozonationand coagulation [1], continuous treatment of textile wastewater
by combined coagulation, electrochemical oxidation and activatedsludge [2], wastewater treatment using chemical oxidation and
physical adsorption [3], ozone treatment for bio-refractory COD
removal [4], electrochemical treatment of wastewater containing
organic pollutants [5], textile wastewater for reuse by means of
different membrane processes [6], use of sequencing batch reactors
and Fenton’s reagent to treat a wastewater from a textile industry[7].

dye factory wastewater [17] . The inability of biological treatment
processes in degrading refractory compounds makes chemicaltreatment a necessary stage prior to bio treatment in order toproduce more readily biodegradable materials by integration ofchemical and biological oxidation processes for implementation[18] . The objective of this research is to evaluate the kinetics of a
new combined electrochemical degradation and biological oxida-tion treatment system for an organic process industry. A thoroughstudy of the optimum range of application for each method is arather difﬁcult task, but future work should be driven in this direc-tion.
A ﬁrst attempt [19] led to the choice of the technology in
which wet air oxidation appears to be the most suitable technologyfor wastewater containing between 20 and 200 g L
−1of COD. The
suitability of wet air oxidation would be further reinforced if a het-erogeneous catalyst were successfully incorporated in the process.Wastewater with relatively small COD contents ( ≤5gL
−1) can be
suitably treated by means of advanced oxidation processes sincehigher COD contents would require the consumption of too largeamounts of expensive reactants. In these cases, it would be moreconvenient to use wet oxidation or incineration; wastewater withCOD higher than 20 g L
−1may undergo autothermic-wet oxidation
[20] . However the application of electrocatalytic oxidation makes
the non-biocompatible organic efﬂuent to biocompatible organiccompounds. To make the efﬂuent amenable for biological degrada-tion it is preferred initially to adopt electrochemical treatment. Ifthe biological degradation stops due to decay of endogenous cells,then electrochemical treatment is carried out once again and sub-sequently biological oxidation is continued. This sequence is tobe repeated till the desired result is obtained. One of the mainadvantages of the electrochemical processes is that electrons arereleased or consumed within the electrodes, supplying a clean reac-tant, which does not increase the number of chemical moleculesinvolved in the process.
Actual wastewater was used in this research was collected from
a chemical industry, Sanmar Speciality Chemicals Limited, locatedat Berigai, near Hosur in Tamil Nadu; this unit manufactures per-formance chemicals for ﬂavours and fragrances, resins, polymersand elastomers and intermediates for complex phytochemicalsextracted from plants such as aloe vera, sunﬂower, etc. Typicallythis industry generates efﬂuent around 35,000 L per day contain-ing industrial solvents such as benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene,xylene and hexane and salt (sodium chloride was used for clean-ing the equipments and the processing units). Before treatmentthe efﬂuent contains COD 40,000–60,000 mg L
−1, SS 6000 mg L−1,
TDS 150 g L−1, pH 7.3 and the colour is dark brown. In the present
study, various experiments were conducted to reduce pollutionload and reuse the water. The efﬂuent typically contains COD about48,000 mg L
−1. When it was distilled, the COD of the conden-
sate reduces to 17,000 mg L−1which was subjected to electrolytic
degradation and subsequently biological oxidation was continuedusing various microorganisms such as Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris in a batch reactor.
If the output treated water is found unsuitable for process-
ing in the industry, once again sent for treating to repeat thesequence till the desired result is obtained. This scheme constitutesan electrochemical–biochemical sequential reaction system.
2. Theoretical approach
2.1. Electrochemical degradation
The advantages of using electrochemical techniques (elec-
trooxidation and electro-coagulation) include: environmentalcompatibility, versatility, energy efﬁciency, safety, selectivity,
amenability to automation, and cost effectiveness [21] . The use of
electrochemical technology has been widely studied as a methodfor the removal of organic substances [21–23] . Good removal rates
were observed and it was suggested that the electrochemicalmethod can be used as a pre-treatment step in pesticide wastedisposal [24] .
The dimensionally stable anodes (DSAs) are promising materi-
als for many electro-organic applications and have been classiﬁedas ‘active’ or ‘non-active’, depending on its chemical nature [25,26] .
Active electrodes mediate the oxidation of organic species via theformation of higher oxidation states oxides of the metal (MO
x+1),
whenever a higher oxidation state can be reached by the metaloxide (e.g., RuO
2or IrO 2)—leading to selective oxidation that makes
the non-biocompatible organic efﬂuent to biocompatible organiccompounds. Non-active electrodes present no higher oxidationstate available and the organic species is directly oxidized by anadsorbed hydroxyl radical, generally resulting in complete combus-tion of the organic molecule (e.g., SnO
2or PbO 2). Titanium substrate
insoluble anodes (TSIA) with RuO X–IrO X–TiO Xcoating [27] anodes
were employed in the present investigation since these electrodesare commercially available and are well known anode material foruse in neutral chloride media.
2.1.1. Electro-coagulation (EC)
This is a process involving many chemical and physical phe-
nomena in which the coagulating ions are produced in situ and itinvolves three successive stages: formation of coagulants by elec-trolytic oxidation of the sacriﬁcial electrode, destabilization of thecontaminants, particulate suspension (and breaking of emulsions)and aggregation of the destabilized phases to form ﬂocs.
Electro-coagulation has been successfully employed in indus-
trial efﬂuents for removal of organic contaminants, oil and greases.In this process, a potential is applied to the metal anodes, typi-cally fabricated from either iron or aluminum, which causes twoseparate reactions. Iron upon oxidation in an electrolytic systemproduces iron hydroxide, Fe (OH)
n, where n= 2 or 3. Mechanisms

The Fe(OH) nformed remains in the aqueous stream as a
gelatinous suspension, which can remove the pollutants fromwastewater either by complexation or by electrostatic attraction,followed by coagulation [31] . In the surface complexation mode,
the pollutant acts as a ligand (L) to chemically bind hydrous iron:
L-H(aq)(OH)OFe(s) →L·OFe(s) +H
2O(1) (8)
The prehydrolysis of Fe3+cations also leads to the formation
of reactive clusters for treatment. The performance of electro-Author's personal copy

2.1.2. Electro-oxidation (EO)
The mechanism of electrochemical oxidation of wastewater
is a complex phenomenon involving coupling of electron trans-fer reaction with a dissociate chemisorptions step. Basically twodifferent processes occur at the anode; on anode having highelectro-catalytic activity, oxidation occurs at the electrode surface(direct electrolysis); on metal oxide electrode, oxidation occursvia surface mediator on the anodic surface, where they are gen-erated continuously (indirect electrolysis). In direct electrolysis,the rate of oxidation is depending on electrode activity, pollutantsdiffusion rate and current density. A generalized scheme of theelectrochemical conversion/combustion of organics on noble oxidecoated catalytic anode (MO
x) is shown in Fig. 1 . In the ﬁrst step, H 2O
is discharged at the anode to produce adsorbed hydroxyl radicalsaccording to the reaction.
MO
x+H2O→MO x(•OH)+H++e−(10)
In the second step, generally the adsorbed hydroxyl radicals may
interact with the oxygen already present in the oxide anode withpossible transition of oxygen from the adsorbed hydroxyl radical tothe oxide forming the higher oxide MO
x+1.
MO x(•OH)→MO x+1+H++e−(11)
At the anode surface the active oxygen can be present in two
states. Either as physisorbed (adsorbed hydroxyl radicals (•OH)
or/and as chemisorbed (oxygen in the lattice, MO x+1). In the absence
of oxidizable organics, the active oxygen produces dioxygen accord-ing to the following reactions:
MO
x(•OH)→MO x+1
2O2+H++e−(12)
MO x+1→MO x+1
2O2 (13)
When NaCl is used as supporting electrolyte, Cl ion may anodi-
cally react with MO x(•OH) to form adsorbed OCl radicals according
to the following:
MO x(•OH)+Cl−→MO x(•OCl)+H++2e−(14)Further, in presence of Cl ion, the adsorbed hypochlorite radicals
may interact with the oxygen already present in the oxide anodewith possible transition of oxygen from the adsorbed hypochlo-rite radical to the oxide forming the higher oxide MO
x+1according
to the following reaction and also MO x(•OCl) simultaneously react
with chloride ion to generate active oxygen (dioxygen) and chlorineaccording to the following reactions:
MO
x(•OCl)+Cl−→MO x+1+Cl2+e−(15)
MO x(•OCl)+Cl−→MO x+1
2O2+Cl2+e−(16)
In the presence of oxidizable organics, the physisorbed active
oxygen (•OH) could cause predominantly the complete combus-
tion of organics and chemisorbed will participate in the formationof selective oxidation [25,26] products according to the following
reactions:
1
2R+MO x(•OH)→1
2ROO+H++e−+MO x (17)
R+MO x+1→RO+MO x (18)
The physisorbed route of oxidation is the preferable way for
waste treatment. Since the organic hydrogen peroxides formed arerelatively unstable, decomposition of such intermediates leads tomolecular breakdown and formation of subsequent intermediateswith lower carbon numbers. These sequential reactions continueuntil the formation of carbon dioxide and water [32,33] . In this
case the diffusion rate of organics on the anode area controls thecombustion rate [5,34] . On the other hand, temperature, pH and dif-
fusion rate of generated oxidants determine the rate of oxidationin indirect electrolysis. In the same way indirect electrochemicaloxidation mechanism has been proposed for metal oxide with chlo-ride as supporting electrolyte for wastewater treatment [35–37] .
In indirect electro-oxidation, chloride salts of sodium are added tothe wastewater for better conductivity and generation of hypochlo-rite ions. The reactions of anodic oxidation of chloride ions to formchlorine in bulk of solution is given as

Since organic compounds of the efﬂuent are electrochemically
inactive, the primary reaction occurs at the anodes is chloride ionoxidation (Eqs. (15) and (16) ) with the liberation of Cl
2,w h i c hi s
a robust oxidizing agent. As regards to the reactions in the bulk,gaseous Cl
2dissolves in the aqueous solutions due to ionization
as indicated in Eq. (19) . The rate reaction is less in acidic solu-
tion due to OH−instability and considerably more in basic solution
due to ready formation of OCl−(pKa7.44) ion in Eq. (20) imply-
ing that the basic or neutral pH conditions are more favorablefor conducting reactions involving chlorine. The direct electro-oxidation rate of organic pollutants depends on the catalytic activityof the anode, on the diffusion rate of the organic compounds in theactive points of anode and applied current density. The indirectelectro-oxidation rate of organic pollutants depends on the diffu-sion rate of the oxidants into the solution, ﬂow rate of the efﬂuent,temperature and the pH. In moderate alkaline solution a cycle ofchloride–chlorine–hypochlorite–chloride takes place, which pro-duces OCl
−. The pseudo steady state theory can be applied to each
of the intermediates products (HOCl and OCl−) taking part in the
bulk solution. Taking all other reactions are irreversible processes,the rates of reactions r
ifor the sequence are

−rorganic =k4[organic][OCl−] (25)
Then using the above equations we can easily deduce the fol-
lowing expression:
−rCl2=−rorganic =k4[organic][OCl−] (26)
Finally as regard to bulk solution it is also to be noted that −rCl2=

where k1is heterogeneous electrochemical rate constant. Hence,
in the following section an attempt has been made to establish arelation between the reacting species in bulk and at the electrodesurfaces. The basic relationship applicable to all electrochemicalreactions is Faraday’s law that relates to the amount of substancereacted at the surface to the charge ( I
At) passed is MAIAt/nF(assum-
ing 100% current efﬁciency) and the characteristic measurableparameter is current density, i
A, which is IA/Ae. Thus the electro-
chemical reaction rate (for the disappearance of reactant A) can be
expressed as

where IAis the current passed in time t,MAis the molecular weight,
nis the number of electrons transferred per mole of reaction, Ae
electrode area, VRreactor volume and Fis the Faraday (96,500 C or

ciﬁc electrode area ( Ae/VR). Assuming the main electrode reaction

The reaction may be assumed to be under diffusion control as

is transported for the bulk to electrode surface where it under goeselectrochemical oxidation to Cl

In electrochemical conversion the high molecular weight aro-
matic compounds and aliphatic chains are broken to intermediateproducts for further processing.
2.2. Kinetics of biochemical oxidation
Understanding of the biochemical activities of the important
microorganisms is the basic information to design a biologicaltreatment process. In order the microorganisms to reproduce andfunction properly, organisms must have a source of energy, car-bon for synthesis of new cellular material, inorganic elements ornutrients. Organic nutrients (growth factor) may also be requiredfor cell synthesis. Carbon and energy source usually referred toas substrate. Two of the most common sources of cell carbon formicroorganisms are organic matter and carbon dioxide. The prin-cipal inorganic nutrients needed by microorganisms are nitrogen(N), sulphur (S), potassium (P), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), etc.In addition to these inorganic nutrients needed, some organismsmay also need organic nutrients.
Effective environmental control in biological waste treatment
is based on the basic principle governing the growth of microor-ganisms. Bacteria can reproduce either by binary ﬁssion or by asexual mode or by budding. Generally, they reproduce by binaryﬁssion (i.e. by dividing, the original cell becomes two new organ-isms). The time required for each division is termed, the generationtime, can vary from days to less than 20 min. For bacteria would notcontinue to divide indeﬁnitely because of various environmentallimitations, such as substrate concentration, nutrient concentra-tion, or even system size. Different growth rate can be used forbacterial growth like, growth in term of bacterial numbers, growthin term of bacterial mass and growth in term of mixed cultures.
To ensure that the microorganisms will grow, they must be
allowed to remain in the system long enough to reproduce. Thisperiod depends on their growth rate, which is related directly tothe rate at which they metabolize or utilize the waste. Assumingthat the environmental conditions are controlled properly, control-ling the growth rate of the microorganisms can ensure effectivewaste stabilization. In both batch and continuous culture systemsthe rate of growth of bacterial cells can be deﬁned by the followingrelationship
r
g=dX
dt=/SYNX (39)
where rg= rate of bacterial growth, /SYN= speciﬁc growth rate,
X= concentration of microorganisms. Because d X/dt=rgis for batch
culture and is also valid for batch reactor. In batch culture, if one ofthe essential requirements either substrate or nutrients for growthwere present only in limited amounts, it would be depleted ﬁrstand growth would cease, in continuous culture, growth is lim-ited. Experimentally it has been found that the effect of a limitingsubstrate or nutrient can often be deﬁned adequately using theAuthor's personal copy

following expression proposed by Monod.
/SYN=/SYNmS
ks+S(40)
where /SYN= maximum speciﬁc growth rate, S= concentration of
growth-limiting substrate in solution, ks= half-velocity constant,
substrate concentration at one-half the maximum growth rate. Ifthe value of /SYNis substituted in Eq. (39) , the resulting expression for
the rate growth rate is
dX
dt=/SYNmXS
ks+S(41)
In both batch and continuous-growth culture systems, a portion
of substrate are converted to new cell and a portion is oxidized toinorganic and organic end products. Because the quantity of thenew cell produced has been observed to be reproducible for givensubstrate, the following relationship has been developed the rateof substrate utilization and the rate of growth.
dX
dt=−YdS
dt(42)
where Y= maximum yield coefﬁcient (deﬁned as the ratio of
the mass of cell formed to the mass of substrate consumed).r
su=dS/dt= Substrate utilization rate.
If the value of rgfrom Eq. (41) substituted in Eq. (42) , the rate of
substrate utilization can be deﬁned as follow:
dS
dt=−/SYNmXS
Y(ks+S)(43)
In Eq. (43) , the term /SYNmX/Yis often replaced by the term C,
deﬁned as the maximum rate of substrate utilization.
If the term Cis substituted in Eq. (43) , the resulting expression
is
dS
dt=−CS
ks+S(44)
In bacteria systems used for wastewater treatment, the distri-
bution of cell age is such that not all the cells in the system are inthe log-growth phase. Consequently, the expression for the rate ofgrowth must be corrected to account for the energy required for cellmaintenance. However, if most of the cells in the bacterial systemare in lag-growth phase, the solution of Eq. (44) is

The plot of ln( S/So)/(S−So)v s . t/(S−So) or ln(1 −x)/xvs.t/xwill
be linear if the above Monod’s kinetics is followed. From the inter-cept half-velocity constant can be computed and the maximumutilization rate of substrate is obtained from slope.
The decrease in cell mass caused is proportional to the concen-
tration of organisms present. This decrease is often identiﬁed in theliterature as the endogenous decay. The endogenous decay term canbe formulated as follows:
r
d(endogenous decay) =−kdX (47)
where kd= endogenous decay coefﬁcient.When Eq. (47) is combined with Eqs. (39) and (41) , the following
expression are obtained for the net rate of growth

where r/prime
g=net rate of bacterial growth.
The corresponding expression for the net speciﬁc growth rate is
given by
/SYN/prime=/SYNmS

where /SYN/primeis the net speciﬁc growth rate.
The effect (of endogenous respiration on the net bacterial yield)
are accounted for by deﬁning an observed yield as follow

Benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes, collectively
known as BTEX, are widely used as industrial solvents for extrac-tion of intermediates and complex phytochemicals from plantssuch as aloe vera, sunﬂower, etc. and equipment cleansing. Sinceall BTEX compounds showed inhibition to cell growth, the Hal-dane’s equation can be used in modeling the kinetics with highsubstrate concentrations which is often deﬁned adequately usingthe following expression:

3. Materials and methods
Actual efﬂuents sample after a screening of solids was used
in this research. The efﬂuent was characterized before and afterthe combined electrochemical degradation and biological oxida-tion treatment, mainly in terms of chemical oxygen demand.
The chemical oxygen demand, total suspended solids (TSS),
volatile suspended solids (VSS), oil and grease and pH weremeasured according to the American Public Health Associ-ation/standard methods for the examination of water andwastewater methods.
3.1. Electrolytic system
3.1.1. Electrochemical oxidation
A batch electrolytic cell ( Fig. 2 ) was used for the electrochemical
degradation process. The experimental setup consists of an undi-vided electrolytic cell of 240 mL working capacity, closed with a PVClid having provisions to ﬁx a cathode and an anode keeping 1.5 cminter-electrode distance. A salt bridge with reference electrode wasinserted through the holes provided in the lid. Titanium substrateinsoluble anodes with a RuO
X–IrO X–TiO Xcoating (Subbiah et al.
[27] ) was an expanded mesh (of area 38 cm2) was employed and
a stainless steel plate (of dimension 6.0 cm ×4.0 cm ×0.2 cm) was
used as the cathode. A multi-output 2 A and 30 V (DC regulated)power source (with ammeter and voltmeter) was connected to thecell. Stirring was done with a magnetic stirrer. The electrolyte takenwas the distillated efﬂuent (obtained after distillation of raw efﬂu-ent).
3.1.2. Electro-coagulation
The experimental setup ( Fig. 2 ) consists of an undivided
electrolytic cell of 500 mL capacity (with working capacity of240 mL) closed with a PVC lid having provisions to ﬁx a cath-
ode and a sacriﬁcial anode. A salt bridge with reference electrodewas inserted through the holes in the lid. The cathode was astainless steel plate and anode was a mild steel plate both ofsize 6.0 cm ×4.0 cm ×0.2 cm kept in the cell maintaining inter-
electrode distance of 1.5 cm. A DC regulated multi-output (2 Aand 30 V) power source (with ammeter and voltmeter) was con-nected to the cell. Stirring was done with a magnetic stirrer. Theelectrolytes taken were the actual raw efﬂuent and the distillatedefﬂuent (obtained after distillation of raw efﬂuent) for investiga-tion.
3.2. Microbial system3.2.1. Microorganism and media
B. subtilis, P. aeruginosa, P. vulgaris strains were obtained from
Microbiology Laboratory, Bharathidasan University, Trichy. A nutri-ent broth (100 mL distilled water containing peptone 0.5 g, yeastextract 0.3 g, sodium chloride 0.5 g was being sterilized at 121
◦C,
1 . 1k gm−2for 20 min) has been prepared. The slant culture of vari-
ous bacterial strains such as B. subtilis, P. aeruginosa, P. vulgaris were
inoculated in the nutrient broth separately and then it was beingkept in the incubator for its further growth. Initially microorgan-isms were grown aerobically at 37
◦C and pH value 7 and further
sub-culturing was done.
The nutrient medium containing grown microbes were serially
diluted and made spread plate in agar plate and appeared colonieswere counted after 24 h.
To eliminate the microbial adaptation period in the biodegrada-
tion experiments, microbes were pre-adapted to 100 mL mediumand 5 mL of distillated efﬂuent (where initially there was no degra-dation of efﬂuent on the adaptation).
The cultures were acclimatized to efﬂuent by exposing the cul-
tures in a series of shake ﬂasks wherein the content of peptonewas decreased and that of efﬂuent increased over a period of threemonths.
The temperature in all the batch experiments was maintained
at 30
◦C. The growths of the organisms were identiﬁed after 24 h
by the turbidity nature by measuring optical density and the cul-ture was maintained and all the inoculums transfers were done inexponential phase.
3.3. Electrolytic degradation3.3.1. Procedure for electrochemical oxidation
The efﬂuent of 240 mL was taken in a reactor. The required cur-
rent was passed for predetermined interval of time using regulatedpower supply. During the electrolysis the cell voltage, electrodepotentials were measured. A sample of 1 mL were collected at every1 h and subjected to the COD analysis. Experiments were carriedout for the distillated efﬂuent. The experiments were carried outin this batch setup at the current density of 1 A dm
−2and which
was conducted for different time intervals such as 1–7 h. That isfor various charge input, the efﬂuent was subjected to biologicaloxidation. Various experimental conditions, parameters measuredand calculated are presented in the tables and ﬁgures.
3.3.2. Procedure for electro-coagulation
The efﬂuent of 240 mL was taken in the cell. The required current
was passed using regulated power supply. During the experimentthe cell voltage, electrode potentials were measured. A sample of1 mL was collected at every 1 h and subjected to the COD analysis.Experiments were carried out for the distillated efﬂuent as wellas raw efﬂuent. The each experiment was carried out in a batchsetup at different current densities viz 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 A dm

and it was run for 7 h. The various experimental conditions and
parameters measured and calculated are presented in the tablesand ﬁgures.
3.4. Biological oxidation
3.4.1. Batch biochemical process
For biological treatment, after every additional hour of elec-
trolytic degradation the efﬂuent was taken out and subjected tobiological oxidation. That is electrochemically partially degraded(treated) efﬂuent been used as the (raw) efﬂuent for biological oxi-dation. The experiment was carried out in a batch setup of 500 mLcapacity beaker (with working capacity of 300 mL) was used. Efﬂu-ents were collected at different time intervals of ranging from 1 to7 h of electrochemical treatment to follow sequentially biochemicalprocess.
The bacterial organisms such as B. subtilis, P. aeruginosa and
P. vulgaris were tested against this industrial efﬂuent. 100 mL of
medium containing the culture such as B. subtilis was added to the
200 mL of the electrochemically treated wastewater. The total vol-ume of 300 mL capacity of batch setup was being aerated with anaqua pump aerator for a period of 120 h. The samples were beingcollected every 24 h and it was subjected to COD analysis. The exper-iments were repeated for other cultures such as P. aeruginosa and
P. vulgaris. The observations of various parameters were presented
in tables and ﬁgures.
3.5. Error analysis
The least sum of the squares (SS) of the differences between the
experimental data and the data obtained by calculating from themodels SS could be computed. If data from the model are similarto the experimental data, SS will be a small number; if they aredifferent, SS will be a large number. In order to substantiate the bestﬁt model for the system, it is needed to analyze the data using thevalues of SS, combined with the values of the determined regressioncoefﬁcient ( R
2).
4. Results and discussion
4.1. Electrolytic system4.1.1. Electrochemical oxidation and electro-coagulation
The experimental results of the electrochemical oxidation (EO)
as well as of electro-coagulation processes are presented in Fig. 3 a
and Table 1 for the distillated efﬂuent. In respect of electrooxida-
tion process in the batch reactor, at 1 A dm
−2it was observed that
the COD was decreased from 17,000 mg L−1to 3600 (79% of COD
removal) in 7 h for the applied current of 0.24 A (with charge inputof 3.5 Ah L
−1) and with the average cell voltage of 8.3 V, the speciﬁc
energy consumption on average of 5.9 kWh kg−1of COD removal
was obtained where as only 6% of COD removal was obtained afterinput of 0.5 Ah L
−1.
The results of the electro-coagulation experiments for various
current densities were also shown in Fig. 3 a and b for both the
distillated as well as for the raw efﬂuent. The effects of currentdensity on transfer coefﬁcient are shown in corresponding ﬁgure.In case of distillated sample, the system performance is more or lesssimilar at operating current density of 0.8 A dm
−2(see Fig. 3 ) except
that the speciﬁc energy consumption on average of 2.69 kWh kg−1
of COD removal was obtained. But for the raw efﬂuent the % removal
of COD in 7 h was around 59.0 at the highest current density.
The purposes of presenting above experimental results are only
to have an idea before venturing the integration of electro- and

The details of result of electrolytic oxidation and biological
degradation of the efﬂuent were presented in Fig. 3 a,Fig. 4 a–c as
well in Table 1 . That is the bacterial organism such as B. subtilis, P.
aeruginosa and P. vulgaris were tested against the industrial efﬂuent.
The results of the experiment was carried out in a batch setup

electrochemical treatment) to continue sequentially biochemicalprocess (by aeration with an aqua pump aerator) up to 120 h arepresented in Fig. 4 af o r B. subtilis, Fig. 4 bf o r P. aeruginosa and Fig. 4 c
forP. vulgaris .
Fig. 4 a and Table 1 present the result of degradation by B. sub-
tilis by electrochemical and biochemical in which the ﬁgures clearly
indicate that there is remarkable change in the course of the degra-dation process. The % removal rate COD by biochemical in ﬁrst day(in ﬁrst 24 h) is kinetically different from next four days. At lowercharge input (0.5 Ah L
−1) the removal rate is higher and decreases
as charge per litre increases and at higher charge input (3.5 Ah L−1)
the removal rate is much lower on ﬁrst day of biochemical oxida-tion but in the next four days the trends was marginally same. The% removal rate of COD by biochemical oxidation using B. subtilis is
around 88% and the overall COD decreased was 97%.

the modeling of biochemical system. The most widely used is two
parameters Monod kinetics model. In addition, exponential decay,Monod kinetics with endogenous decay and Haldane’s inhibitionto cell growth equation were also used for analysis. The modelrelates the variation of substrate concentration with time. For eachmodel, for a given initial substrate concentration, the followingthree microbes: B. subtilis (Bs), P. aeruginosa (Pa) and P. vulgaris (Pv)
were used microbial degradation. The kinetic model is character-ized by certain constants, explicitly by maximum rate of substrateutilization, C, substrate afﬁnity constant, k
s, endogenous decay
coefﬁcient, kdand substrate inhibition constant, kiwhich expresses
COD removal with time. Exponential decay model, Monod kinetics,Monod kinetics with endogenous decay and Haldane’s inhibitionto cell growth equation constants are evaluated from the % of CODremoval with time for three different microbes ( Bs, Pa and Pv) and
their regression coefﬁcients are also presented in Table 2 . High
regression coefﬁcients (mostly greater than 0.9) were found for allthe microbes studied, suggesting that all models are very suitablefor describing the kinetic model in that studied concentration. Theapplicability of all the models to the efﬂuent implies that both sub-strate afﬁnity and substrate inhibition exist under the experimentalconditions used. This is due to the presence of biodegradable andrefractory organic present in efﬂuent. The degradation of efﬂuentby microbes is thus complex, involving more than one mechanism.From Table 2 , the Exponential decay model and Haldane’s inhibi-
tion to cell growth equation is suited well for degradation of efﬂuentbyP. vulgaris compared to Bsand Paas indicated by the high mag-
nitude of regression coefﬁcient (greater than 0.99), whereas thedegradation pattern of efﬂuent by B. subtilis found to obeys Monod
kinetics model as well as Monod kinetics model with endogenousdecay (which is evident from its high magnitude the regressioncoefﬁcient).
The sequence of performance of microbes on biological degrada-
tion of efﬂuent after the charging 0.5 Ah L
−1isB. subtilis ,P. vulgaris
and P. aeruginosa where as after charge input of 3.5 Ah L−1, ﬁrst day
P. vulgaris dominates and in the next four days the performance of
the sequence is P. aeruginosa, P. vulgaris and B. subtilis.It is to be noted that the kinetic model that are characterized by
constants, such as maximum rate of substrate utilization, substrateafﬁnity constant, k
s, endogenous decay coefﬁcient, kdand substrate
inhibition constant, kidecreases as charge input increases for all
microbes.
5. Conclusions
In the present study, it can be concluded that the refractory
pollution load can be reduced to 2000 mg L−1of COD at optimum
condition experiments (around 2 Ah L−1of charge input) with the
distillated efﬂuent containing 17,000 mg L−1of COD when the efﬂu-
ent was subjected to electrolytic degradation and subsequentlybiological oxidation using any of the microbes such as B. sub-
tilis,P. aeruginosa and P. vulgaris in a batch reactor. This output
once again can be considered for treating electrochemically forremoval of COD up to the prescribed limit so as to constitute anelectrochemical–biochemical sequential reactor system.
