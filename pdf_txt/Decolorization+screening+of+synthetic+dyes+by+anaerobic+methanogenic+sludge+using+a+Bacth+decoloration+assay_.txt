It has been more than a couple of decades since Government of India through 
Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology an d other agencies 
such as DST, Mo EFCC, CSIR, UGC etc., providing huge grants to various researchers 
to develop tre atment system for remediation of damaged environment. The trajectory 
growth of industrialization, urbanization and steep increases in domestic effluent load 
and other anthropogenic activities have caused heavy environmental stress in India. 
Anthropogenic a ctivities over the past centuries have released the compounds of 
xenobiotic origin in various quantities in open environment and are the major cause of 
ground and surface water pollution.  
Widespread use and production of dyes, dye intermediates have left legacy of pollution. 
Hence, it become inevitable to develop technologies for the treatment of industrial 
effluents in order to reduce the impact of pollution on various sites in the vicinities of 
industrial estates and biological methods continue to o ffer and alternative to engineering 
and chemical methods of treating such pollution. Restoration of damaged ecosystems is 
given priority in environmental sciences and technology.  
This compendium intends to cover in consistent way the current methodologies  to most 
innovative and systematic advances in treatment of dyes, dye intermediates 
manufacturing and textile processing industrial effluents.  
Initially it provided comprehensive of the current methodologies, applications and 
challenges to the treatment o f industrial effluents discharged by dyes and dye 
intermediates and textile processing industries, with plethora of new technologies 
available.

  21.1 Opening Remarks  
From the ages of the foot print of first human being, the planet earth has changed both radically 
and resourcefully.  As it is said ‘Necessecity is the mother of invention’,  they have always 
astonished them self since the first invention of ‘Wheel’. And the discovery of fire has provided 
the lethal (sic) combination for galaxies of ‘discoveries and inventions’ which have paved the 
way for modern earth. The nature has endowed human being with such an amazing 
inquisitiveness, today looking back to the time of billions of years ago even mother earth would 
find difficult to recognize herself due to the changes we brought withi n few hundred of years of 
time.        
Since the time of modern industrialization during twentieth century and coincided with the early 
phase of human population rise, it marks a major turning point in human history. The revolution 
began an era of per -capita economic growth and has completely changed the living style and 
raised socio -economic standard of human. This unprecedented population rise and urbanization 
has brought along with it an ever increasing industrial appetite that has resulted in enormous 
amount of waste generation for which we are unprepared.   
The early excitement of industrialization has now compelled us to think about developing 
environmental remediation strategies on priority basis to save the basic essential components of 
life. The deterioration of pristine environment has directly or indirectly affected human health. 
This has aggravated the need for understanding the impact of recalcitrant pollutants in an 
ecosystem. Moreover, the problem has become worse with the pollution of potable w ater which 
bears the most and sever impact of all components of habitable ecosystem.  
Our ancestors were amused with the shades of colour of nature. Ever since primitive people could 
create, they have been endeavouring to add colour to the world around the m. They used natural 
materials to stain hides, decorate shells and feathers and paint their story on the walls of ancient  
caves. We can able to date the pigments (black, yellow, reddish, white) made from ochre used by 
primitive man in cave painting to over  15,000 BC. The historic use of dye was evidently of 
natural and organic origin. It was of plant extract as the Indigo from Dyer's wood ( Tinctoria 
isatis ), the red alizarin from Madder ( Rubia tinctorum ), also from insects (Persian scarlet), 
mollusks (Tyria n purple), few fungi and lichens. These natural resources were more native from 
the regions where they have used for dyeing processes. Until sixteen centaury dyeing procedure 
were not known globally, but later on techniques developed and skilled by Egyptia n was 
remained in use until without much improvement took place in nineteen centaury.    
The earliest evidence of dyeing in India comes from Indus civilization (2300 – 1750 BC), when a 
piece of cotton at Mohen -jo-daro dyed with madder (a vegetable dye) was  found. Archaeologist 
found various pigments, yellow, red, blue, white, green and black in paintings at Ajanta and Bagh 
caves. Paintings also depict men wearing colour garments which indicate the advancement made 
by dyeing industries in India. In 1630 Mr. Higginson of Salem from North Carolina noted for 
local vegetation based dye “here to be divers roots and berries wherewith the Indians dye 
excellent holiday colours that no rain or washing can alter”.  
Since the first introduction of synthetic dye in mid ni neteenth centaury, colourant industry was 
well developed in European and other markets. However, with the environmental concern and 
strict legislation, in last few decades there has been a notable transition in global production of 
dyes, production base fr om Europe, USA (i.e. west) were shifted towards east and Asia has 
emerged as manufacturing hub of dyestuff production.   Introduction

1.2 The Problem    
Considering the volume and composition of the wastewater industrial effluents, dyeing (both 
manufacturing and appli cation) industry is rated as one of the foremost industrial sectors that 
pollutes environment. It is actually difficult to estimate the actual global production and 
consumption of dyes, but it is estimated that worldwide production of dyes and pigments wou ld 
reach 9.0 million tons by volume of US$ 30.0 billion by the 2020 . However, according to one 
estimates there was an annual production of >7.5 x 105 metric tons of different dyes and nearly 
280,000 tons (i.e. 2 -50%) of textiles dyes are discharged into th e effluents.  
To dye 1 kg of cotton, it requires 70 -150 L water, 30 -60 g dyestuff, 0.6 -0.8 kg NaCl, which at the 
end of the process generates nearly 20 -30% of applied unfixed dyes at a concentration of 2000 
ppm along with high salt content and other auxili ary compounds . The raw materials used for the 
manufacturing of dyes and dye intermediates are benzene, toluene, xylene and naphthalene along 
with certain heavy metals. The dyeing industry uses different dyes, fastening and binding agents, 
soda-ash, caustic  soda, organic sequestering agents, and other accessory chemicals depending of 
the dyeing method and fabric use for dyeing.  
Therefore, i ndustrial effluent containing wastewater from the textile industry is a complex 
mixture of many xenobiotic substances r anging from dye and dye intermediates, organochlorine -
based pesticides to heavy metals associated with dyes and the dyeing process. They are typically 
characterized by residual color, alkaline pH (mostly), excess TDS content, high COD and 
relatively low BO D values. In addition to the common chemical constituents, textile waste also 
contains a host of auxiliary chemicals. Thus, the wastewater, upon discharging into the water 
bodies without any adequate treatment, affects the multi segments of the environment  leading to 
irreversible persistent changes.     
 
1.3 Indian Scenario  
The indigenous setup of dye industries was started in the year 1940 and today India has emerged 
as second biggest exporter of dyestuff in the global market. India currently shares aroun d 12.5 % 
of the global market in colourant industries (out of which 60  % are exported), having production 
capacity of more than 200,000 tonnes per annum, with an estimated value of US$ 3.4 billion (for 
the year 2010). More than 95 % of the domestic require ment was met by indigenous industries, 
out of which textile industry consumes nearly 60 % and the remaining is shared by paper, leather 
& other consumer industries.  
The major route by which dyes enters the environment is via industrial effluent. The wastew ater 
contains different dye classes depending upon its usage and to know the relative share of each dye 
class in the effluent, dye consumption data should be considered together with the degree of 
fixation of the different dye classes . It can be observe th at degree of dye fixation on for reactive 
dyes are lowest while basic dyes have higher affinity for its substrates. It is estimated that about  
800 mg/l of hydrolysed reactive dye remains in the dye bath after dyeing process. Several 
modifications in dyeing  process are being made to increase the rate of fixation of reactive dyes; 
still degree of fixation varies.

  62.1 Need for this Compendium  
Since the first introduction of synthetic dye i n mid nineteenth centaury, colourant industry was 
well developed in European and other markets. However, with the environmental concern and 
strict legislation, in last few decades there has been a notable transition in global production of 
dyes, production  base from Europe, USA (i.e. west) were shifted towards east and Asia has 
emerged as manufacturing hub of dyestuff production.   
Dyes and pigments are primarily used in the production of consumer products (like textiles, 
printing inks, paints, plastics, pa pers, plastics, foods, etc.) for adding the colour and patterns of 
materials. The technological evolution during 19th centaury have lead to the gradual shift from 
Natural dyes (which have been used since 3500 B.C. from extracts of vegetables, fruits and 
flowers) to synthetic chemical dyes that provides richer colour which retain on the materials for 
longer period throughout wash and exposure.  
 
2.2 Environmental Problem  
As a matter of fact, it is difficult to estimate the actual global production and consum ption of 
dyes, but it is estimated that worldwide production of dyes and pigments would reach 9.0 million 
tons by volume of US$ 24.2 billion by the 2025 (Global Industry Analysts). However, according 
to one estimates there was an annual production of >7.5 x 105 metric tons of different dyes and 
nearly 280,000 tons (i.e. 2 -50%) of textiles dyes are discharged into the effluents.   
Because of the infinite structural variation there exists a vast pool of synthetic dyes, each of them 
having its own individual p roduction process. But, benzene/naphthalene, toluene/xylene,  
sulphuric acid, metallic elements (such as chromium, copper) is commonly used throughout the 
dye manufacturing and application industry (where dyes are synthesized in a reactor, mixed, 
filtered f or impurities, dried and finally blended). The textile industry alone consumes more than 
3,600 different types of chemical dyes. According to the  Pure Earth (Blacksmith Institute), USA* 
and Green Cross, Switzerland* reports on of 2016, “ The World’s Worst P ollution Problems 2016: 
The Toxics Beneath Our Feet ” dye and textile industries are ranked Tenth and accounts for 
220,000 –430,000 Disability -Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) in low - and middle -income countries 
(including India).  
Along the way of production and  application of dyes, many other accessory chemicals for 
fastening and binding agents, soda-ash, caustic soda, organic sequestering agents , additives, 
solvents are added as a catalyst for reactions. For example, in textile industry, the number and 
variety of chemicals used is directly correlates with the intricacy of the designs and desired 
patterns required in the clothing. Their manufacturing generates large amounts of vapours during 
dyeing, printing and curing of dye or colour pigments. Dust emission is associated with fiber 
processing. Besides these, the textile mills also use wood, coal or oil fired boilers and thermic 
fluid heaters which becomes point emission sources for pollutants.   
The unorganized small scale units disproportionately add to the pro blem of environmental 
pollution, besides the large organized production units. To dye 1 kg of cotton, it requires                      
70-150 L water, 30 -60 g dyestuff, 0.6 -0.8 kg NaCl, which at the end of the process generates 
nearly 20 -30 % of applied un fixed dyes at a concentration of 2000 ppm along with high salt 
content and other auxiliary compounds. To an estimate nearly 9 trillion gallons of water is used 
for cooling, cleaning, rinsing and processing of dyes and textile, besides its use during the 
production of dye itself. This massive use of water is in fact a key component of pollution.  Need of this compendium  
  7Considering the volume and composition of the wastewater industrial effluents, dyeing (both 
manufacturing and application) industry is rated as one of the foremost i ndustrial sectors that 
pollutes environment. The complexity and heterogeneity of the textile effluents is because of high 
variation in chemical use, which is closely tied to the continuous and constantly evolving high 
demands for variable patterns and uniq ue colors for clothing and other textiles. The Pure Earth’s 
database propose that, chromium, lead, cadmium, sulphur, nitrates, chlorine compounds, arsenic, 
mercury, nickel and cobalt are few of the top pollutants arise from dye industries. The textile 
industrial effluent are typically characterized by residual color, alkaline pH (mostly), excess TDS 
content, high COD and relatively low BOD values. T herefore, the wastewater effluents of dye 
industries pose a direct, serious and complex threat to the environm ent and health of the 
surrounding populations.  
2.3 Indian Scenario  
The indigenous setup of dye industries was started in the year 1940 and today India has emerged 
as second biggest exporter of dyestuff in the global market. India currently shares around 1 2.5 % 
of the global market in colourant industries (out of which 60 % are exported), having production 
capacity of more than 200,000 tonnes per annum, with an estimated value of US$ 3.4 billion (for 
the year 2010). More than 95 % of the domestic requiremen t was met by indigenous industries, 
out of which textile industry consumes nearly 60 % and the remaining is shared by paper, leather 
& other consumer industries.  
In legacy, during earlier days of pollution awareness, it was found that wastewater from dye 
industry is directly dumped into surface waters or surrounding natural fresh water streams without 
treatment. An observation made by World Bank noted that, dye and textile and industries 
contribute upto 17 -20 % of total industrial water pollution.   
There a re several general underlying reasons for dye related wastewater problem (particularly in 
India):  
•  The foremost and key issue is, many dyeing facilities throughout the world are small 
(sometimes family -run) scale and is prohibitively expensive to afford the proper effluent 
treatment plant for every unit.  
•  Another significant concern is poor practices for control of effluent, coupled often with lack of 
evolved technology for management and treatment of textile wastewaters  
• Oversight of regulation and l egislation by the industries as well as implementing agencies for 
discharge of effluents   
•    The presence of such industries close to or within densely human populated areas  
 
2.4 Scope of the Compendium  
While the problem of industrial pollution by dyes , dye intermediates and pigments remains 
prevalent in country like India, different cost -effective solutions to treat and prevent the problem 
already exist. Governments are making important progress in dealing with the problem but further 
efforts are requi red to improve the quality of life for millions of people affected by toxic 
pollution. Alone government and efforts from handful of agencies/organizations are not 
sufficient. The challenges are two fold: (1) finding enough financial resources for more 
interventions and (2) to scale up the already effective approaches to extend the support and 
assistance to the million of individuals in the communities which are struggling with pollution 
menace, requires immediate attention. As it stands major bottle neck in  pollution control in Need of this compendium  
  8developing (as in India) and under - develop countries is lack of proper funding mechanism that 
can specially address pollution.       
With this backdrop, there cannot be a better opportunity (when the head of the state is insisting 
about “Swachh Bharat) to address the short -fall on technology for the treatment methodology for 
industrial wastes of dyes, dye intermediates, pigments and textiles  being carried out in the 
country.

3.6 Conclusion  24 Steps involved in textile processing  
  103.1 Opening Remarks  
To devise an effective wastewater remediation technology for textile effluents, it is important to 
understand the processes involved in textile processing. Because the quantity and quality of  the 
effluent produced at the end of each steps varies depending upon the raw material and fabric used 
for dyeing. This would help to recognize the difficulty faced during devising the technology and 
the inefficiency of the selected methodology for the tre atment.   
 
3.2 Steps involved in textile processing  
In textile industry the transformation of raw cotton to final usable form involves wet processing 
of several stages as follows:  
3.1.1 Sizing / Slashing  
This is the initial process which involves sizing o f yarn with either with starch or polyvinyl 
alcohol (PVA) or carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC) to provide necessary tensile strength and 
smoothness required for weaving. During this stage requirement of water varies from 0.5 to 8.2 
l/kg of yarn with an averag e of 4.35 l/kg.  
3.1.2 Desizing  
The sizing components which are rendered water soluble during sizing are removed from the 
cloth to make it suitable for dyeing and further processing. This can be done either through acid 
(sulphuric acid) or with enzymes. Th e required water at this stage varies from 2.5 to 21 l/kg with 
an average of 11.75.  
3.1.3 Scouring / Kiering  
This process involves removal of natural impurities such as greases, waxes, fats and other 
impurities. The desized cloth is subjected to scouring.  This can be done either through 
conventional method (kier boiling) or through modern techniques (continuous scour). Kiering 
liquor is an alkaline solution containing caustic soda, soda ash, sodium silicate and sodium 
peroxide with small amount of detergen t. The water required for this process varies from 20 – 45 
l/kg with an average of 32.5.  
3.1.4 Bleaching  
Bleaching removes the natural colouring materials and renders the cloths white. More often the 
bleaching agent used is alkaline hydrochloride or chlor ine. For bleaching the good quality fibre, 
normally peroxide is used. The chemicals used in peroxide bleaching are sodium peroxide, 
caustic soda, sulphuric acid and certain soluble oils. The water and chemical requirement and the 
effluent generation normal ly vary based on the type of operation and the material (yarn / cloth) to 
be processed. Bleaching the yarn both through hypo -chloride and hydrogen peroxide methods 
require same quantity of water and it varies between 24 to 32 l/kg. But in the cloth bleachi ng, the 
water requirement is much higher and it fluctuates between 40 -48 l/kg.  
3.1.5 Mercerising  
The process of Mercerisation provides lustre, strength, dye affinity and abrasion resistance to 
fabrics. It is generally carried out for cotton fabrics only f or easy dyeing. Mercerisation can be 
carried out through cold caustic soda solution followed by washing with water several times. The 
water required for this process varies from 17 to 32 l/kg, with an average of 24.5.  
3.1.6 Dyeing  
Dyeing is the most compl ex step in wet processing which provides attractive colour for the 
product. Dyeing is carried out either at the fiber stage, or as yarn or as fabrics. For dyeing proce ss, Steps involved in textile processing  
  11hundreds of dyes and auxiliary chemicals are used. In brief, the water requirement fo r dyeing 
purpose (include all types and shades) varies from 36 – 176 l/kg with an average of 106. The 
effluent generation during dyeing process fluctuates from 35 to 175 l/kg with an average of 105 
l/kg. 
 
3.3 Type of textile waste product  
Textile industrie s are the one of the most water intensive industrial segments. The industry also 
uses variety of chemicals for its different manufacturing steps. Water is mainly used for (i) the 
application of chemicals onto textiles and (ii) rinsing the manufactured text iles. The amount of 
water required and consumed would vary from industry to industry, depending upon the type of 
fabrics produced and dyeing process employed. An average amount of water consumed by 
different fabrics is listed in Table 3.1 and the percentag e of water required during the wet 
processes is as shown in Table 3.2.

Within textile industry, wet processes use variety of chemicals in large amount as well as water. It  
is estimated that to produce 1 kg of fabrics, it requi res 80 -150 m3 water and nearly 1,000 -3,000 
m3 of wastewater is generated after processing of between 12 and 20 tonnes of textiles per day. It 
can be seen from the Table 3.3 and Table 3.4, industries using cotton, consumes more water as 
compared to syntheti c textiles.  Steps involved in textile processing

At the end of each stage of textile dyeing, large amount of wastewaters are generated containing 
unused dyes (in large quantity) and other accessory chemicals. Type of chemicals and quantity 
used during bleach ing and dyeing (i.e. in wet processes) is listed in the Table 3.5. Due to inherent 
limitation of textile dyeing process there always that a portion of unfixed dyes washed and 
released along with wastewater.

Therefore, textile wastewater always fou nd to be rich in unfixed dyes (which pollutes the 
environment are difficult to treat), as shown in Table 3.6. As it can be seen the based on the dye 
class and the fiber to which they are applied wastewater contains un -used dyes ranging from                 
2 – 50 %.      
 
The solid wastes generally are not found to be hazardous, are originated from dry process, but the 
wet process produce only a small amount of solid wastes. Solid wastes are either fabrics or 
packing materials, while from wet process, dried  up sludge is a major source of solid waste (Table 
3.7). Besides solid waste, textile industries also emit gaseous pollutants. In textile industry, 
boilers, ovens and storage tanks are the three major sources of air pollution (Table 3.8). The 
boilers gener ate sulphur oxides and nitrogen, while the drying process which requires high 
temperature emits hydrocarbons.

3.4 Impact of textile e ffluents  
The characteristics of textile effluents always vary from industries to industries (or within the 
industries) and depend of the textiles (fibers) which are being manufactures and chemicals used 
during the production. T he textile effluents usually contains, suspended and dissolved solids, 
unused chemicals and dyes (colour), biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand 
(COD) and odour. In many cases BOD/COD ratios are found to be near 1:4, which clearly 
indicate s the presence of bio -recalcitrant, xenobiotic and non -biodegradable compounds in the 
effluents. Typical characteristics of textile effluent are as described in the Table 3.9 and the 
possible pollutants present in the effluents at the end of each stage of wet process are listed in the 
Table 3.10. It is not necessarily that values of each parameter would fall in the range described in  
the tables. These can change depending on the type of fiber manufactured in respect to market 
demands and process employed, viz. pH of the textile effluent can reach between (as low as)                
2 and 3.               
Textile effluents also contain inorganic chemicals (and salts) like, sodium hydroxide, sodium 
sulphide, hydrochloric acid, sodium hypochlorite along with unu sed dyes.

The dye concentration in textile effluents usually ranges between 0.01 g/L and 0.25 g/L, 
depending on the type of the dye used and the process carried out for dyeing. Indigo dyes are us ed 
at a concentration of 0.02 g/L and Vat dyes are used at a concentration in the range of 0.05 to 0.1 
g/L. Textile effluents also contains a large amount of organic compounds which are difficult to 
degrade and are resistant to aerobic degradation. Under a naerobic conditions these compounds are 
found to be reduced into toxic and carcinogenic intermediates. Few of the prominent carcinogenic 
compounds produced due to the degradation of azo dyes are as shown in Table 3.11.  
The possible pollution loads after d ifferent wet processes are as listed in Table 12 shows the 
pollution loads from wet processing plants. The pollution loads after processing various textiles 
are as shown in Tables 3.13 -3.16.

Through varies studies and case observations, human exposure to textile dyes are reported to 
cause headaches, irritations in lung and skin, congenital malformations and nausea. A study 
reported the evidence of liver, urinary balder and kidney cancers in workers after prolonged 
exposure to textile dyes, besides asthma, rhinitis, nasal problems and dermatitis. Benzidine, a 
know n carcinogen is detected in textile effluent with disperse dyes such as disperse orange 37, 
disperse blue 373 and disperse violet 93 dyes. In a distinct study on sever different dyes (direct 
violet, direct congo red, cremazoles orange 3R, direct royal blue , cremazoles blue S1, direct 
Bordeaux, and cremazoles brown GR), the AMES showed the evidence of mutagenic compounds.  
 
3.5 Textile effluent disposal standard  
Across the globe, different countries have different limits of the disposal of treated textile 
effluents in the open environment. Table 17 describes the regulation imposed by the several 
prominent countries where textile industries are one the major contributor in national economy.

3.6 Conclusion   
It is well know that dyeing and textile industri es are one of the biggest polluters amongst all industrial segments. The quantity of wastewater gene rated 
after textile processing is enormous (nearly 200 L of water are used to produce 1kg of textile). Wit h three different types o f fabric (cellulose fiber , 
protein fiber and synthetic fiber) used in the textile industries the type and level of toxic compou nds found in effluents va ries considerably among the 
industries as noted above. By knowing the types and load of toxic com pounds at the end of each cycle of textile processing, it would be advantageous to 
develop the wastewater treatment technology more specifically.     Management of wastes, rules & laws for environnemnt protection

4.1 Classification of wast es            
The Basel Convention by United Nation Environment Programme (UNEP) has defined wastes 
as “substances or objects, which are disposed of or are intended to be disposed of or are 
required to be disposed of by the provisions of national law”. Waste management has been 
always a perennial and predicament problem across the countries. It can broadly be comprises of 
identification/detection, segregation, collection, transportation, recycling, treatment and re -
processing and final disposal. Depending u pon the type/kind of waste management, it has varying 
impacts on energy consumption, carbon storage, methane emission, ecological imbalance and 
human health.   
The study by World Health Organization (WHO) suggested that nearly a quarter of the diseases 
prevailing today are due to prolong exposure to environmental pollution. Many of these diseases 
were remained undetected either acquired during childhood or manifested in alter part of 
adulthood. Also it was observed that there are social implications of wast e due to insufficiency   
     
4.2 General classification of wastes  
In a broad way on the basic of their sources (domestic as well as industrial) waste can be 
classified under ‘urban’, ‘industrial’, ‘biomedical’ and e -waste (Figure 4.1), These are generated  
during extraction, manufacturing and processing of raw materials into intermediate and final 
products and their consumptions.     
 
 
Figure 4.1 : General classification of anthropogenic wastes  
 
 
Industrial waste can be further classified as Hazardous, Non -Hazardous and Waste water, which 
are either by -products of manufacturing processes or unused/discarded commercial products. 
Hazardous wastes are identified into: characteristics waste, listed wastes, universal wasters and 
mixed wasters (Figure 4.2).       Management of wastes, rules & laws for environnemnt protection

Wastes that are described by Environmental Protection Agency (US) can be considered as 
hazardous and termed as Listed Wastes. This includes the F-list (wastes from co mmon 
manufacturing and industrial processes), K-list (wastes from specific industries), P-list and U-list 
(wastes from commercial chemical products).  
The F-listed  wastes originate from various sectors of industial sector; generally include wastes 
from non -specific sources, from common manufacturing and industrial process, viz. solvents.  
The K-listed  wastes are source specific wastes, i.e. wastes from dye and textiles industries, 
petroleum refining or pesticides manufacturing, including sludge and wastewate r from treatment 
process from such industry.  
The P-listed  and U-listed  wastes are discarded specific commercial chemical products in an 
unused form like certain pesticides and pharmaceutical products (when discarded in open 
environment become hazardous).   
 
4.2.3 Characteristic Wastes  
Hazardous industrial wastes which are not specifically listed where they exhibits (i) Ignitability 
(e.g. used solvent and waste oils, which can spontaneously combustible at < 60ºC), (ii) 
Corrosivity (e.g. acids or bases, pH ≤ 2 or ≥ 12.5; capable of corroding metal containers and 
another example is battery acid), (iii) Reactivity (e.g. wastes which are unstable under ‘normal’ Management of wastes, rules & laws for environnemnt protection  
  28conditions, that can cause explosion when heated or compressed, shoot toxic fumes/gases, like 
lithium -sulphur batteries), (iv) Toxicity (e.g. wastes which are harmful or fatal when ingested or 
absorbed, waste containing mercury or lead, etc.)         
 
4.2.4 Universal Wastes  
Waste under this category includes batteries, bulbs, pesticides i.e. which are of c ommon in use 
across the planet   
 
4.2.5 Mixed Wastes  
Waste that contains both radioactive and hazardous waste components.  
4.3 Indian Scenario for Hazardous wastes  
In India, inventorization of industries generating hazardous wastes and their quantification are 
being done by the respective State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs). Ministry of Environment & 
Forests (MoEF), Government of India, has categorized the industries on the basis of the severity 
of pollution from a specific industry, which are Red, Orange  and Green in decreasing order of 
severity of pollution.  
Seventeen industries are notified and listed under ‘ RED ’ category, belonging to heavily polluting 
units and are covered under Central Action Plan. Dyes, pigments and intermediates related 
industries are classified into this category. Twenty -five types of industries are classified into 
‘ORANGE’  category. Small scale industries and which are not included under ‘RED’  or 
‘ORANGE’  are identified in ‘GREEN’  category.        
 
4.3.1 Industrial Waste Water  
The liquid industrial waste generated from different sources can broadly be classified into four 
categories according to nature of pollutants present in the effluent.  
 
(A) Organic pollution  
Industrial effluents generated from industries like tanneries, polyme r processing units, dairies, 
distilleries, vegetable oil and food processing units, sugar industries etc. are rich in organic 
contents. Domestic and municipalities wastes are also rich in organic content. These wastes have 
high COD and BOD.  
 
(B) Dissolved  Solids  
Dissolved solids are generated manufacturing and applications of Pesticides, Fertilizers, 
Pharmaceutical and other chemical industries.  
 
(C) Liquid Wastes having Toxic Chemicals   
The industrial effluents from hazardous chemicals units, Tannery an d Dye industries, 
Electroplating, Coke –oven, etc.  
 
(D) Cooling Water Liquid Wastes  
Cooling water from Thermal Power Plants, Cable, Rolling Mills, Plastic Mounting, etc.  Management of wastes, rules & laws for environnemnt protection  
  294.4 Laws and Regulations  
By looking at the degree and level of pollution in the cou ntry, most of us would not believe that 
India was the first county in the world to postulate, draft and provide the constitutional safeguard s 
for protection and prevention of (pristine nature of the) environment. In early part of 1970s, 
taking the lead and  inspiration from Stockholm Conference (India is the only nation represented 
by her head of the state) various laws were notified and being implemented for waste 
management. The Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972 was the first statute being promulgated 
constit utionally. To reduce (stop) and to prevent the further pollution of rivers in the country, The 
Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 was came into force. The Environment 
(Protection) Act (EPA), 1986, directly deals to provide the constituti onal framework for handling 
and management of hazardous materials (compounds), prior assessment of the environmental 
impact of major developmental projects, discharge of industrial pollutants and effluents into the 
environment, guidance for industrial sitt ing and management of chemical accidents (Ref.15).  
The Hazardous Wastes (Management and Handling) Rules (Manufacture, Storage and Import 
of Hazardous Chemical), 1989 (amended in 2000 and 2003) and Hazardous Wastes 
(Management, Handling and Transboundary Mo vement)  Rules, 2008 was the first such rules 
to address the industrial waste issues.

  325.1 Various Technology / Treatment process / Methodology used for dye and textile effluent 
wastewa ters  
 
Depending upon the characteristic of wastewater, it can be subjected for different treatment 
options either from physical, chemical and/or biological processes or combination of them. These 
treatment technologies can be employed at preliminary, prim ary, secondary or tertiary and/or at 
more advanced stage. Few of the very commonly used methods are described below.  
 
5.1.1 Flocculation  
It is a physico -chemical process that encourages the aggregation of coagulated colloidal and 
finely divided suspended matter by physical mixing or chemical coagulant aids. Flocculation 
process consists of a rapid mix tank and a flocculation tank. The process involves mixing of 
wastewater stream with coagulants in a rapid mix tank, which is then passed on to the flocculati on 
basin where slow mixing of waste occurs which allows the particles to agglomerate into heavier 
more settleable solids. Either mechanical paddles or diffused air facilitates better mixing.  
The different types of chemicals used in coagulation include ino rganic electrolytes, natural 
organic polymers and synthetic poly electrolytes. The selection of a specific chemical depends on 
the characteristics and chemical properties of the contaminants.  
 
5.1.2 Sedimentation  
This process is aimed to remove easily set tleable solids. Sedimentation chambers may also 
include baffles and oil skimmers to remove grease and floatable solids and may include 
mechanical scrapers for removal of sludge at the bottom of the chamber.  
 
5.1.3  Dissolved Air Floatation  
Use of bubbles i n this process is required to raise the suspended particles in wastewater up to 
surface level and hence make it easy for their collection and removal. Air -bubbles are introduced 
into the wastewater and attach themselves to the particles, thus causing them to float. This process 
of diffused air flotation can be used to remove suspended solids and dispersed oil and grease from 
oily wastewater. Wastewater is pressurised and contacted with air in a retention tank. The 
pressurised water that is super -saturated w ith air is passed through a pressure - reducing valve and 
introduced into at the bottom of floatation tank. As soon as pressure is released the super -
saturated air begins to come out of solution in the form of fine bubbles. The bubbles get attached 
to suspe nded particles and become enmeshed in sludge flocs, floating them to surface. Float is 
continuously swept from the surface and sludge may be collected from the bottom. Addition of 
certain coagulants increases the oil removal efficiency of DAF units.  
 
5.1.4 Clarification  
Clarification system uses gravity to provide continuous, low cost separation and removal of 
particulate, flocculated impurities and precipitates from water and generally follow the processes 
which generate suspended solids such as biologica l treatment. In a clarifier, wastewater is allowed 
to flow slowly and uniformly, permitting the solids to settle down. The clarified water flows from 
the top of the clarifier over the weir. Solids get collected at the bottom and sludge must be 
periodically  removed, dewatered and safely disposed.  
 Methods evovled for removal of dye  
  335.1.5 Neutralization  
Incoming untreated wastewater has a wide range of pH, and it is difficult to treat wastewater with 
such a high variability of pH. Neutralization is the process used for adjusting pH to optimiz e 
treatment efficiency. Acids such as sulphuric or hydrochloric may be added to reduce pH or 
alkalis such as dehydrated lime or sodium hydroxide may be added to raise pH values. 
Neutralization may take place in a holding, rapid mix or an equalization tank.  It can be carried out 
at the end of the treatment also to control the pH of discharge in order to meet the standards.  
 
5.1.6 Precipitation  
For removal of metal compounds from the stream of wastewater, precipitation is carried out in 
two steps. In the fir st step, precipitants are mixed with wastewater allowing the formation of 
insoluble metal precipitants. In the second step, precipitated metals are removed from wastewater 
through clarification and/or filtration and the resulting sludge must be properly tr eated, recycled 
or disposed. pH is an important parameter to consider in chemical precipitation. Metal hydroxides 
are amphoteric in nature and their solubility increases towards higher or lower pH. Thus, there is 
an optimum pH for hydroxide precipitation f or each metal. Wastewater generally contains more 
than one metal. Therefore, selecting the optimum treatment chemical and pH becomes more 
difficult and involves a trade -off between optimum removal of two or more metals. Various 
chemicals used for this proc ess are lime, sodium hydroxide, soda ash, sodium sulphide and 
ferrous sulphate. Normally, hydroxide precipitation which is effective in removing metals like 
antimony, arsenic, chromium, copper, lead, nickel and zinc. Sulphide precipitation is used in 
remov ing mercury, lead, copper, silver, cadmium etc.  
 
5.1.7 Activated sludge process  
It is a continuous flow, aerobic biological treatment process that involves suspended growth of 
aerobic micro -organisms to biodegrade organic contaminants. Influent is introd uced in the 
aeration basin and is allowed to mix with the contents. A suspension of aerobic microbes is 
maintained in the aeration tank. A series of biochemical reactions in the basin degrade the 
organics and generate new bio mass. Micro -organisms oxidize the matter into carbon dioxide and 
water using the supplied oxygen. These organisms agglomerate colloidal and particulate solids. 
The mixture is passed to a settling tank or a clarifier where micro -organisms are separated from 
the treated water. The settle d solids are recycled back to the aeration tank to maintain a desired 
concentration of micro -organisms in the reactor and some of the excess solids are sent to sludge 
handling facilities. To ensure biological stabilization of organic compounds, adequate nu trient 
levels of nitrogen and phosphorous must be available to the bio mass. The key variables to the 
effectiveness of the system include:  
 (i) Organic loading  which is described as food to micro -organism ratio (F/M) ratio or Kg of 
BOD applied daily to the  system per Kg of biological solids in aeration tank. F/M ratio 
determines BOD removal, oxygen requirements and bio mass production. Systems designed 
and operated at lower F/M provide higher treatment efficiency.  
 (ii) Sludge retention time  (SRT) or sludge  age is the measure of the average retention time 
of solids in the system and the SRT, similar to F/M ratio, affects the degree of treatment, 
oxygen requirements and the production of waste sludge. Systems designed and operated at 
higher SRT provide higher  treatment efficiency.  Methods evovled for removal of dye  
  34 (iii) Oxygen requirements  are based on the amount required for biodegradation of organic 
matter and the amount required for endogenous respiration of micro -organisms.  
Various modifications in activated sludge process are possible b y changing one or more of the 
key parameters. Sequential batch reactor is a form of the activated sludge process where aeration, 
sedimentation and decantation processes are performed in a single reactor.  
 
5.1.8 Biological filters  
These filters are biolog ical reactors filled with media which provide a surface that is repeatedly 
exposed to wastewater and air and on which a microbial layer can grow. The two most common 
types of biological filters are;  
(i) Trickling Filters : In trickling filters treatment is  provide by a fixed film of microbes that 
forms on the surface which adsorbs organic particles and degrades them aerobically. 
Wastewater is distributed over a bed made of rock or plastic and flows over the media by 
gravity.  
(ii) Rotating Biological Contra ctor:  A rotating biological contactor (RBC) consists of a 
series of discs about 40% of the area is immersed in waste water and the remainder of the 
surface is exposed to atmosphere, provide a surface for microbial slime layer. The 
alternating immersion and  aeration of a given portion of the disc enhances growth of the 
attached micro -organisms and facilitates oxidation of organic matter in a relatively short 
time and provides a high degree of treatment.  
 
5.1.9 Anaerobic Treatment Systems  
These processes are  slower than aerobic degradation and when sulphur is present, obnoxious 
hydrogen sulphide gas is generated. Though the capital cost is high, part of it can be compensated 
by recovery of bio gas. They are not so commonly used in wastewater treatment systems  for 
CETPs except as a means for sludge stabilization.  
 
5.1.10 Granular Media Filtration  
Many processes fall under this category and the common element being the use of mineral 
particles as the filtration medium. It removes suspended solids mainly by physi cal filtration. Two 
common types of these granular media filers are  
(i) Sand filters  are the most common type which consists of either a fixed or moving bed of 
media that traps and removes suspended solids from water passing through media.  
(ii) Dual or m ultimedia filtration  consists of two or more media and it operates with the 
finer, denser media at the bottom and coarser, less dense media at the top. Common 
arrangement is granite base at the bottom, sand in the middle and anthracite coal at the top. 
Flow pattern of multimedia filters is usually from top to bottom with gravity flow. These 
filters require periodic back washing to maintain their efficiency.  
These processes are most commonly used for supplemental removal of residual suspended solids 
from th e effluents of chemical treatment processes.  
 
5.1.11  Membrane Filtration  
This technique is used to separate particles from a liquid for the purpose of purifying it. In 
membrane filtration, a solvent is passed through a semi -permeable membrane. The membran e's Methods evovled for removal of dye  
  35permeability is determined by the size of the pores in the membrane. The size of the pores has to 
be carefully calculated to exclude undesirable particles, and the size of the membrane has to be 
designed for optimal operating efficiency. The result is a cleaned and filtered fluid on one side of 
the membrane, with the removed solute on the other side. Microfiltration, ultrafiltration and nano -
filtration are examples of membrane filtration techniques.  
 
5.1.12 Reverse Osmosis Systems  
This is also a membra ne separation method that is used to remove several types of large 
molecules and ions from solutions through application of pressure to the wastewater on one side 
of a selective membrane. The result is that the contaminant is retained on the pressurized si de of 
the membrane and the treated waste water is allowed to pass to the other side.  
 
5.1.13  Ultrafiltration  
Unlike reverse osmosis membranes which retain all solutes including salts, ultrafiltration 
membranes retain only macro molecules and suspended so lids. Thus salts, solvents and low 
molecular weight organic solutes pass through ultrafiltration membrane with the permeate water. 
Since salts are not retained by the membrane, the pressure differences across ultrafiltration 
membrane are negligible. Flux r ates through the membranes are fairly high, and hence lower 
pressures can be used . 
 
5.1.14 Nanofiltration  
Nanofiltration can be positioned between reverse osmosis and ultrafiltration. Nanofiltration is 
essentially a lower pressure version membrane where th e purity of permeate water is less 
important. The nanofiltration is capable of removing hardness elements such as calcium or  
magnesium together with bacteria, viruses, and colour. Nanofiltration is operated on lower 
pressure than reverse osmosis and as suc h treatment cost is lower than reverse osmosis treatment.  
Nanofiltration is preferred when permeate with some residual TDS but without colour, COD and 
hardness is acceptable. Feed water to nanofiltration should be of similar qualities as in case of 
revers e osmosis. Turbidity and colloids should be low. Disinfection of feed may also be necessary 
to remove micro -organism.  
 
5.1.15  Ion Exchange  
Ion exchange is a process of exchange of ions between two electrolytes or between an electrolyte 
solution and a comp lex. Ion Exchange can be used in wastewater treatment plants to swap one ion 
for another for the purpose of demineralization. There are basically two types of ion exchange 
systems, the anion exchange resins and the cation exchange resins. It can be used fo r softening, 
purification, decontamination, recycling, removal of heavy metals from electroplating 
wastewaters and other industrial processes, polish wastewater before discharging , removal of 
ammonium ion from wastewaters, salt removal, purify acids and b ases for reuse, removal of 
radioactive contaminants in the nuclear industry, etc.  
 
5.1.16  Activated carbon  
Activated carbon is used in a large range of applications in tertiary waste water treatment. 
Powdered as well as granular activated carbons are used  for the purpose of de -chlorination of 
organic compounds. Organic compounds in waste water are adsorbed on to the surface of the 
activated carbon. A number of factors affect the effectiveness of the activated carbon. These Methods evovled for removal of dye  
  36include pore size, composition an d concentration of the contaminant, temperature and pH of the 
water and the flow rate or contact time of exposure. Activated carbon can be applied on a broad 
spectrum of organic pollutants and is typically used to remove contaminants from water such as 
pesticides, aromatic compounds such as phenol, adsorbable organic halogens, non -biodegradable 
organic compounds, colour compounds and dyes, chlorinated/ halogenated organic compounds, 
toxic compounds, compounds that normally inhibits biological treatments, oi l removal in process 
condensates, halogens, especially chlorine that oxidises downstream processes and organics that 
have the potential to foul ion exchange resins or reverse osmosis membranes.  
 
5.1.1 7 Ultraviolet (UV) Disinfection  
This technique is prim arily employed as a disinfection process that inactivates waterborne 
pathogens without use of chemicals. Additionally, UV is also effective for residual TOC removal, 
destruction of chloramines and ozone.

6.2 Conclusion  49 Histroty of bioremediation  
  386.1 Brief History of Bioremediation  
It is of common belief that bioremediation is a relatively modern technology. But it is not a new 
concept. Romans, as early as 600 B.C.E., used the complex networks of sewers for treatment of 
wastewaters, where microorganisms had pivotal role to play. The basic process gradually been 
modified and was applied to treat different contaminant.  
In the modern history, process of bioremediation was earnestly studied and understood in 1940s. 
Two decades later, in 1960s, an Assistant C ounty Petroleum Engineer George M. Robinson, 
working for Santa Maria, California, spent his spare time in experimenting for cleaning up of 
Mucky Jar and the abandoned oil sumps of Cat Canyon Oil Filed developed the process of 
Bioremediation. In 1968, he ex periment the process on large scale for microbial clean up of 
various oil spills. Besides oil spills, he also experimented, on sewage, leach fields, as well as 
odour and pest control and demonstrate complete clean up using bioremediation.                   
Nearly twenty years later, the imfamous Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound at 
Alaska in 1989 was the actual genesis of bioremediation globally. After successful clean up of 
this oil spill, bioremediation was established as technology, that is discussed, applied, researched 
and became an alternate option (besides physico -chemcial technology) for treatment of 
environmental pollutant. According to Hoff (1993), modern history of bioremediation can be 
divided into three developmental periods: (1) Pr e-1989, (2) Between 1989 and 1991 and (3) Post 
1992.  
 
 
Table 6.1:  A glimpses of important showcase and facts about the history of bioremediation  
 
No. Period of 
the Event 
(Year)  Description of the Event  
1 600 B.C.  The evidence pointed that early civilizati on in Rome (and others) 
have built intricate networks of sewers during 600 B.C. The 
network collects waste water which subsequently underwent to 
biological treatment.    
2 1800 A.D.  In Rhode Island, it was believed that disposing of waste into 
local river s (surrounding the human habitat) would dilute the 
wastes.  
3 1960 A.D.  The process of bioremediation was first reported by Petroleum 
Engineer Mr. George M. Robinson, in California, during his 
experiments with dirty jars and abandoned oil slumps.   
In 1960, through U.S. Office of Naval Research supported 
projects oil -metabolizing (micro) -organisms were recognized.   
4 1968 A.D  Mr. George Robinson organized first large -scale microbial 
cleanup of oil spill.  
 
5 1970 A.D.  The U.S. Environmental Protectio n Agency (US -EPA) was 
founded  
Dr. Anand Chakrabaty and his colleagues at General Electric, 
USA identified a bacterial strain (Pseudomonas), capable to 
degrade oil components.  Histroty of bioremediation  
  396 1972 A.D.  The bioremediation process was first commercially used to clean 
up a Sun Oil pipeline spill in Ambler, Pennsylvania, USA.   
In the same year fuel holding tanks of Ship RMS Queen Mary 
was cleaned up.  
7 1974 A.D  The Indian Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act was 
implemented.  
8 1975 A.D.  The Indian Water  (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Rules 
was formulated  
The oil -degrading superbug was developed by Dr. Ananda M. 
Chakrabarty at General Electric, USA.   
9 1980 A.D.  Form 1980 onwards bioremediation process was commercially 
used for the treatment of contaminated soils groundwater.  
10 1989 A.D.  Literate community has accepted the use of Bioremediation  
Following Exxon Valdez oil spill, bioremediation as a 
technology was established across the globe.   
11 1990 A.D.  Derek Lovely and his coworker s proposed the cleanup of 
Uranium contamination in groundwater using bioremediation in 
early 1900’s  
12 1992 A.D  USEPA conducted a survey and received the information on 240 
cases of bioremediation in the United States.  
13 2002 A.D.  Field level of experi ments to test the efficiency of uraninite 
bioremediation were started in 2002  
 
6.1.1 Courtship Period (Pre -1989 era)  
Before Exxon Valdez oil spill and its clean up, the period was seen as possible use and 
understanding the role of microorganisms in clea ning up of contaminated sites, i.e. dedicated to 
research. It is the period when bioremediation was little known outside the small community of 
academic, microbiologist and applied research or hazardous waste management community. A 
series of scientific an d technical reports and articles were published after successful studies under 
laboratory conditions during 1970s and 1980s. This includes review papers describing 
mechanisms of biodegradation and results from controlled filed experiments determining 
degra dation rates in various environments. Several studies after major oil spills (like of Amoco 
Cadiz spills) measured oil degradation in the environment using microorganisms, that confirms 
previously reported laboratory research. Bioremediation now has been e stablished as a technology 
and a viable option especially for oil spill cleanup.    
                
6.1.2 Honeymoon Period (1989 -1991)  
In these three years bioremediation received widespread interest and attention from all the 
community. In this period, b ecause of Exxon Valdez oil spill incident, a new revolutionized 
concept was established, what it is known today as ‘bioremediation’. Prior to 1989, there was no 
documented evidence of use of this technology on marine oil spills. Later on bioremediation was  
used (on a trial basis) in a four different oil spill in United States: (1) Seal Beach in California ; (2) 
Prall's Island in New Jersey, (3) the Apex  Barges and (4) Mega Borg  spills in the Gulf of Mexico. Histroty of bioremediation  
  40Gradually the EPA of USA conducted series of lab sc ale and field studies to assess the new found 
concept to use on shorelines in Prince Williams Sound. The positive results, provided impetus to 
use bioremediation more extensively in other similar cases. In later years, two distinct type of 
fertilizers (Ini pol EAP22™: an olepphilic fertilizer formulation and Customblen™: a granular 
slow-release fertilizer) were sprayed to contaminated shorelines in Prince William Sound. 
Followed by the initial (yet dramatic) visual changes in a test plot sprayed with Inipol EAP22™ 
and perhaps because bioremediation seemed like a more friendlier and east technology than other 
available methods for marine oil spill cleanup, bioremediation received comparatively better 
response from the general public. The concern during this ap plication was use of 2 -butoxy -
ethanol a component in Inipol and its toxicity to cleanup workers and wildlifes. Soon the safety 
guidelines were framed and wildlife deterrents were used during the first 24 h of application when 
toxicity is of most concern.  
During this phase, several instances of use of bioremediation (more on experimental basis) in 
open -water and microbial applications with additional supplementation of nutrients on shorelines 
were appeared. Gradually, think -tank from National Oceanic and At mospheric Administration 
(NOAA) of USA, held a cautious approach supporting the use of bioremediation, monitored its 
effectives to rule out potential determination impacts on marine life. It appeased to be rather 
controversial position during the “heyday” of bioremediation era. Soon in 1991, a wonder effect 
of bioremediation as potent cleanup technology started to diminish. The obvious reasons were, 
none of the studies conducted outside Alaska were able to provide the positive evidence of 
effectiveness on b ioremediation in field test. Many of these approaches suffered from poor 
experimental designs, or conducted for a limited period of time or had limiting facilities for 
determining changes in oil concentrations. Several factors affected the effectiveness of  
bioremediation; extended studies have found the toxicity to native ecosystem, possibility of 
eutrophication amongst the many serious concerns were gave mixed results to the unbridled 
enthusiasm for bioremediation. By 1991, bioremediation has stated to pas s out from limelight 
with initial success as ‘wonder technology’.    
   
6.1.3 Establishment Period (1992 onwards)      
Though the period after 1992 can be considered as establishment phase, bioremediation as 
technology has achieved a certain level of accep tance, with more realist expectations than before, 
but the level of attention and interest was gradually decreased. At this time involvement of 
government in form of official guidelines, set of testing laboratory protocols as measuring product 
effectivenes s in degradation (of standardized oil), toxicity testing aquatic organisms and a small -
scale field tests. In 1993, US government issued first set of protocols for bioremediation for 
testing commercial products to be applied during remediation process.             
Bioremediation was now commonly included as an alternate option (among other remediation 
techniques) for cleanup of contaminated areas. Many of the proposals of bioremediation, granted 
for application in open environment are now being accompanied b y some type of monitoring  
programme to access the effectiveness of technique and to prevent spreading the toxicity in 
applied area.    
   
6.2 Conclusion  
The response that concept of bioremediation for hazardous waste received was a more typical 
what has be en observed for any new technologies. The initial high enthusiasms with over Histroty of bioremediation  
  41expectations were an unrealistic which was followed by disappointment and di sillusionment lead 
to a more realistic acceptance of the technology. However, in many ways the ongoing research 
has helped to established and defines the limiting variables of bioremediation as technology. 
Often dealing with bioremediation needs patience t o use the technique appropriately which may 
offer variable substantial benefits during long term approach.

YearProject Sanctioned7.1 Opening Remarks  
The Department of Biotechnology (DBT) Ministry of Science and Technology, New Delhi, is a 
premier funding agency under Government of India supporting research in biotechnology a nd 
allied areas. One of the major focuses of the agency is to provide financial support for research in  
Environmental Biotechnology. It generously supports various research programme on developing 
effective and novel treatment technology for industrial eff luents including liquid waste from dye, 
dye intermediates, pigments and textile industries.  
 
7.2 Pre -Support/Sanction Process for the Research Proposal  
Through internal Task Force on Environmental Biotechnology, DBT invites research proposals 
(throughout  the year or through special calls) on basic and applied research, innovations and 
development of effective technology for wastewater remediation. On receiving the research 
proposals, after the initial screening, they are being sent for reviewing for the s uitability of the 
projects in terms of scope and the objectives of the work proposed, aptness of the budget 
requirement and general outcome of research project. After receiving the comments from the 
reviewers, the project investigators are invited for the brief presentation for the proposed work in 
Task Force Review Meeting. Post presentation if any modifications are required, the investigator 
are invited to submit the revised proposal for possible financial support. The research projects 
which scores in me rit for providing the new outlook in the already existing knowledge in the 
proposed subject are considered for financial support. The normal tenure of the financial support 
ranges between 36 and 60 months.        
 
7.3 Primary Statistics of the Sanctioned P rojects  
Though DBT has started functioning in 1986, the first research project in the area of development 
of treatment technology for dye and textile effluent was sanctioned in the year 1997 -1998 to Dr. 
T. Emilia, Department of BCP & WT Regional Research Laboratory, Thiruvananthapuram - 
695019, Kerela. Since the first project, about 23 different research projects were supported by 
DBT till date (as on December 2017) (Figure 7.1).

  46Collectively for the 27 research projects, DBT has provided a support of Rs. 12,78,28,840/ - and 
project investigators have spend nearly 1002 months for exploring the possibilities of developing 
a effective technology and treatment methodology for liquid waste for dye, dye intermediates and 
textile industry. Amongst the project investigator, maximum number of research projects (i.e. 05) 
was sanctioned to Prof. Datta Madamwar, Sardar Patel University, Vallabh Vidyanagar for the 
financial support of Rs. 5,10,79,000/ -. Prof. S. P. Govindwar and Prof. Jyoti Jadhav from Shivaji 
University, Kolhapur collectively received Rs. 1,27,11,400/ - for 03 research projects. Prof. 
Vankata Mohan, IICT,  Hyderabad has worked on 02 research projects worth of Rs. 58,03,400/ -.           
It was observed that majority of the research projects were sanctioned to the states where textile 
industries are in large numbers (Table 7.1). Twenty six percent of the tota l projects were from the 
investigators belonging from the state of Maharashtra (Figure 7.4). While 21 % of the projects 
were sanctioned to the project investigators belonging to Tamilnadu and Gujarat, followed by 
Telengana and Punjab (7 % each). Such obser vation directly suggest that, region where pollution 
are more due to textile industries, project investigators are more inclined towards working in 
developing remediation technology.

Project V  Ecotechn ology for treating dye waste water of textile industries: A  
demonstration  project  
Objectives  
 1. The project investigator has (previously) demonstrated the technology for 
dye waste water treatment and has been validated by Sanganer Dye 
Manufacturers Associ ation.  
2. In this study, investigator wants to demonstrate the treatment process at a 
level of 30,000 liter/day and also to demonstrate the technology at 10 
locations (5 in Sanganer and 5 in Punjab).  
 
These are the few (representative) objectives of the san ctioned and completed projects. A 
representative four different types of projects were selected ranging from a basic laboratory scale 
to large scale (pilot level/small scale industry) demonstrative project. The majority of the project s 
sanctioned by DBT an d completed can be assorted in the above four categories. The initial study 
of the objectives suggest that in a first category, investigators choose to work on isolation and 
screening of the microorganisms (with descending order of preference of Bacteria>F ungus) from 
environment polluted by industrial effluents either from dye and dye intermediate manufacturing 
industries or textile effluents (i.e. dye application). The potent strains were isolated from long 
term polluted soil, water sources or sediments. I n recent years, because of inherent limitations of 
pure cultures, the dye degradation studies are more focused on developing consortia or mixed 
cultures of different microorganisms.  
Followed by isolation of strains or development of consortia/mixed -cultur es, biotic and abiotic 
parameters were optimized at flask scale (~ 100 ml). In biotic factors, growth source (i.e. carbon 
and energy), potential electron donors, nitrogen sources and their concentrations was optimized in 
either nutritional rich synthetic m edia or in minimal media. In abiotic factors, pH and temperature 
was optimized. The effect of dissolved oxygen concentration, salt concentration, substrate (i.e. 
test dye) concentrations and different types of dyes were simultaneously studied. Beside a sin gle 
dye, experiments were also conducted on mixture of dyes, simulated and real textile effluents.  Status report on projects supported by DBT  
  50The optimization studies are followed by analyzing the dye decolourization  and degradation 
pattern (of test dye compound) using different analytical techni ques like UV -Vis and IR 
spectroscopy, HPTLC, HPLC, GS -MS, LC -MS and NMR under optimized conditions. Generally, 
aim of the above study is to propose the degradation pathway of test dye included in the study. 
Simultaneously the enzymatic studies are also per formed. Measuring the activity of different 
enzymes (oxidoreductase and peroxidase) with study of their inductive or constitutive expression 
presumably indicates the involvement enzymes in dye decolourization and degradation process 
and suggests that degra dation in biologically mediated. Enzymes like azo -reductase, laccase, 
lignin peroxidase, (NADH) -DICP reductase, tyrosinase, veratryl alcohol oxidase, riboflavin 
reductase, aminopyrine N -demethylase, etc. were studied in medium supernatant or from cell free  
extract.  
The idea behind these studies is to correlate the dye degraded intermediates (generated during dye 
metabolism and identified using above noted analytical techniques) with the enzymes involved in 
degradation of dye compounds. To demonstrate the c ompetence of the pure cultures or 
consortia/mixed cultures (in complete mineralization of dye and) intermediates generated during 
dye metabolism is comparatively less toxic than parent compound; different toxicity assays such 
as phytotoxicity cytotoxicity,  genotoxicity are conducted. In phytotoxicity assays, Sorghum 
vulgare  and Phaseolus mongo are most commonly used.   
In second category of projects, objective is to demonstrate the treatment feasibility of developed 
consortia/mixed cultures (or by enriching  the native microorganisms of the raw textile effluent) at 
laboratory scale bioreactors such as aerobic/ananerobic/sequential anaerobic (anoxic) -aerobic 
plugflow, upflow, downflow fixed film or other bioreactors. The treatment feasibilities are 
demonstrate d for a volume ranging from 1 to 5 L as synthetic media or simulated industrial 
effluent or real textile effluents. Various parameters like optimization of packing materials, effec t 
of HRT and OLR, measuring the BOD/COD reduction, change in DO, pH, alkalin ity, TS, TDS, 
TSS and VSS, estimating chlorides, sulphate, phosphate, phenolics, TOC, VFA, VA, TN 
concentration at regular interval of time. In bioreactor based studies, another objective is to 
immobilize the potent pure cultures or consortia/mixed culture s in a suitable gel matrix to 
increase the self -life and to use the immobilized beads in treatment process.      
It can be noted from the Table 7.2 that, very few studies were supported for large scale on -site 
field applications (Project V). Under this cat egory a laboratory (and/or pilot level) tested methods 
are applied for the treatment of textile effluents directly in the industries. The treatment scale c an 
range from few hundreds to thousand liters of effluent in a day. While in a fourth category, 
molec ular aspect of the microbial community involved in bioremediation are being studied. 
Understanding the microbial communities in terms of their taxonomic identification and 
phylogenetic identification and their functional potential at polluted sties using m etagenomic 
library preparation and screening of clones are one of the basic objectives. Few important genes 
such as azoreductases were screened from metagenomic library or were amplified directly from 
metagenome or consortia/mixed cultures, using degenerat e primers and over -expressed in 
surrogate host for possible use during bioremediation of coloured water. In another objective, 
microbial community dynamics of consortia/mixed cultures during metabolism of test dye 
compound were studied using qPCR. The micr obial community was also studied from different 
stages of effluent treatment at Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP) on the basis of 16S 
rRNA gene sequences using Sanger Sequencing method or next generation massive parallel 
sequencing of whole metagenome .                     Status report on projects supported by DBT

7.4.2 Results and Observations  
Besides analyzing the objectives, the study of results would provide more understanding about the 
status of the research in bioremediation of dye and textile effluents.  
The observed results of few of the research projects supp orted by DBT are mentioned below.   
Results of Project:  Biodegradation of textile dyes (Scarlet RR, Rubine GFL, Brown 3REL, 
Methyl Red, Brilliant Blue, Golden Yellow HER and Remazol Red) using Galactomyces 
geotrichum MTCC 1360 and consortia with Brevibacil lus laterosporus . 
The G. geotrichum  showed 86% of decolorization of Golden Yellow HER within 30 h, at 30oC 
and pH 7.0 under microaerophilic (static) condition with significant reduction in COD (73%) and 
TOC (62%), respectively. This organism tolerates 500 mgl-1 of dye concentration. The 
degradation efficiency of this strain using carbon and nitrogen sources viz. wheat bran and 
glucose showed fast decolorization individually as well as glucose in combination with 
ammonium chloride and yeast extract responsib le for faster decolorization of Golden Yellow 
HER. Enzymatic studies indicate the involvement of azo reductase, laccase and NADH -DCIP 
reductase enzymes in biotransformation. Azo dyes can be cleaved symmetrically or 
asymmetrically depending on the structure  of substrate. The products of degradation were 
identified as 4(5 -hydroxy, 4 -amino cyclopentane) sulfobenzene and 4(5 -hydroxy cyclopentane) 
sulfobenzene by GC -MS. In addition, when G. geotrichum  was applied to decolorize textile 
effluent, it showed 85% of true color removal (ADMI removal) within 72 h, along with a 
significant reduction in TOC (42%) and COD (58%) under microaerophilic condition. 
Phytotoxicity study revealed less toxic nature of the formed metabolites as compared to parent 
dye with respect to  S. vulgare  and P. mungo . 
Malt extract medium was found to be most suitable for the degradation of Remazol Red among 
the other used media. The G. geotrichum  showed 96% decolorization of Remazol Red (50 mgl-1) 
for 36 h, at 30oC and pH 11.0 under microaeroph ilic condition along with significant reduction in 
COD (62%) and TOC (41%). Peptone (5.0 g l-1), rice husk (10 g l-1 extract) and ammonium 
chloride (5.0 g l-1) were found to be more significant among the carbon and nitrogen sources used. 
The presence of ty rosinase, NADH -DCIP reductase, riboflavin reductase and induction in azo Status report on projects supported by DBT  
  52reductase and laccase activity during decolorization indicated their role in degradation. The 
metabolites produced after degradation was analyzed by HPTLC, FTIR, HPLC and GC -MS. The 
asymmetric cleavage of azo dye Remazol Red was carried out by azo reductase into reactive 
intermediate and subsequently mineralized by other enzyme found in G. geotrichum . 
Phytotoxicity study indicated the conversion of complex dye molecules into simpler ox idizable 
products having less toxic nature.  
The degradation of disperse azo dye and its toxicological approach in the sense of Allium cepa . G. 
geotrichum  MTCC 1360 showed 87 % decolorization of Rubine GFL (50 mg l-1) within 96 h at     
30 oC and pH 7.0 und er microaerophilic condition with significant reduction of COD (67%) and 
TOC (59%). The natural carbon and nitrogen sources like rice husk, wood shaving and bagasse 
was found to efficient for the decolorization of dye along with other sources used. Examina tion of 
oxidoreductive enzymes viz. laccase, tyrosinase and azo reductase confirmed their role in 
decolorization and degradation of Rubine GFL. Biodegradation of Rubine GFL into different 
metabolites was confirmed using HPTLC, HPLC, FTIR and GC -MS analysis . During 
toxicological studies, cell death was observed in Rubine GFL treated Allium cepa  root cells. 
Toxicological studies before and after microbial treatment was studied with respect to 
cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, oxidative stress, antioxidant enzyme st atus, protein oxidation and lipid 
peroxidation analysis using root cells of Allium cepa . The antioxidant enzymes SOD and GPX 
were found to have the dose dependent induction, whereas CAT showed dose dependent 
inhibition. Similarly, lipid peroxidation and pr otein oxidation rates were also increased indicating 
the toxic nature of dye and effluent on A. cepa  cells. Toxicity analysis with Allium cepa  signifies 
that dye exerts oxidative stress and subsequently toxic effect on the root cells whereas formed 
metabol ites relatively less toxic in nature. Phytotoxicity study reveals the less toxic nature of 
formed metabolite as compared to control dye Rubine GFL. The successful degradation of Brown 
3 REL, Scarlet RR, Methyl Red and Brilliant Blue G was carried out by G. geotrichum . 
The preferential degradation of azo and non azo dye carried out in mixture. Decolorization 
affected by the chemical structure and surface function group near to azo bond. So we have 
studied time dependant degradation of textile dyes by G. geot richum . In this study proved that the 
chemical structure affected the decolorization phenomenon. The G. geotrichum  MTCC 1360, a 
yeast species showed 88% ADMI (American dye manufacturing institute) removal of mixture of 
structurally different dyes (Remazol red, Golden yellow HER, Rubine GFL, Scarlet RR, Methyl 
red, Brown 3 REL, Brilliant blue) (70 mg l-1) within 24 h at 30oC and pH 7.0 under shaking 
condition (120 rpm). Glucose (0.5%) as a carbon source was found to be more effective than 
other sources used.  The medium with metal salt (CaCl 2, ZnSO 4, FeCl 3, MgCl 2, CuSO 4) (0.5 mM) 
showed less ADMI removal as compared to control, but did not inhibit complete decolorization. 
The presence of tyrosinase, NADH -DCIP reductase and induction in laccase activity during 
decolorization indicated their role in degradation. HPTLC (High performance thin layer 
chromatography) analysis revealed the removal of individual dyes at different time intervals from 
dye mixture, indicating preferential degradation of dyes. FTIR and HPLC  analysis of samples 
before and after decolorization confirmed the biotransformation of dye. The reduction of COD 
(69%), TOC (43%), and phytotoxicity study indicated the conversion of complex dye molecules 
into simpler oxidizable products having less toxic  nature.  
The comparative study of decolorization of two different azo dyes Remazol red and Rubine GFL 
disclosed the diverse catalytic activities of B. laterosporus . It decolorized 100% of Remazol red 
and 95% of Rubine GFL within 30 and 48 h, respectively u nder static condition at 50 mg l-1 dye 
concentration. Significant increase was observed in azo reductase, NADH -DCIP reductase, Status report on projects supported by DBT  
  53veratryl alcohol oxidase and tyrosinase in cells obtained after decolorization of Remazol red; 
whereas these values were much dif ferent with complete inhibition of azo reductase during 
decolorization of Rubine GFL. The plausible pathway of dyes obtained from Gas 
chromatography -Mass spectroscopy (GC -MS) data confirmed the different metabolic fate of these 
structurally unidentical dye s. HPLC, FTIR and HPTLC analysis of extracted metabolites 
confirmed the biodegradation, while phytotoxicity study assured the detoxification of both the 
dyes studied. The results obtained in this study suggests, i) sulpho and hydroxyl group present at 
ortho position to azo group stimulated reduction of azo bond by azo reductase in Remazol red, ii) 
the same reduction was totally hampered due to presence of ethyl -amino propanenitrile group at 
para position to azo group in Rubine GFL. B. laterosporus can degra de the sulphonated azo dyes 
having naphthol ring much faster; supporting that the sulpho and hydroxyl group present at ortho 
position to azo group stimulated the reduction of azo bond by azo reductase. The functional 
groups present in the nearby vicinity o f azo bond play a central role in azo bond reduction.  
B. laterosporus  decolorized 96% of Brown 3 REL within 48 h at pH 7, 40oC in static condition at 
50 mg l-1 concentration. Presence of peptone and yeast extract showed increased decolorization 
efficiency of B. laterosporus , whereas glucose and starch totally inhibited the decolorization 
ability. Enzymatic studies indicate the involvement of Veratryl alcohol oxidase and NADH -DCIP 
reductase enzymes in the biotransformation at these sets of conditions. Biodeg radation products 
of Brown 3 REL were N -carbamoyl -2-[(8-chloroquinazolin -4-yl)oxy] acetamide and N -
carbamoyl -2-(quinazolin -4-yloxy)acetamide when identified by Gas Chromatography -Mass 
spectroscopy. These metabolites found to be much less toxic than Brown 3  REL in phytotoxicity 
study. In addition to the single dye decolorization, B. laterosporus strain proved its applicability  
into the effluent treatment plant as it decolorized textile industry effluent with effective reducti on 
in COD and TOC. Same strain us ed further for biodegradation study of disperse dye Scarlet RR 
in which, 100% decolorization of same was obtained within 48 h with pH and temperature optima 
of pH 7 and 40oC, respectively. From the studied carbon and nitrogen sources, decolorization 
effici ency was observed better in yeast extract and peptone while carbon sources have shown 
reduced decolorization of Scarlet RR. At the enzyme level, induction in activities of veratryl 
alcohol oxidase, tyrosinase, NADH -DCIP reductase and riboflavin reductase w as recorded. The 
Biodegradation of Scarlet RR into different metabolites was confirmed by the HPLC, FTIR and 
HPTLC. A possible fate of metabolism of Scarlet dye was determined using GC -MS. It revealed 
the proposed biodegradation pathway of Scarlet RR into final product, N -(1λ3-chlorinin -2-yl) 
acetamide. Phytotoxicity study revealed completely nontoxic nature of degraded metabolites to 
Sorghum vulgare and Phaseolus mongo plants as compared to toxic Scarlet RR. In addition, B. 
laterosporus  can degrade the dye  with high concentrations of it and can also be used repeatedly 
for at least five cycles.  
The biodegradation of a mixture containing seven commercial textile dyes with different 
structures and color properties has been investigated by B. laterosporus . It s howed 87% 
decolorization in terms of ADMI removal (American dye manufacturing institute) within 24 h. 
The effective decolorization of dye mixture was attained in the presence of metal salt -CaCl 2 and 
nitrogen sources. The activity of oxidative enzymes in ce llular organization amplifies during the 
stress of structurally different dyes. High performance thin layer chromatography exposed the 
mechanism of preferential biodegradation of dyes at different time periods. Significant change in 
the High pressure liqui d chromatography and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of sample 
before and after treatment confirmed the biodegradation of dye mixture. Phytotoxicity study 
revealed the much less toxic nature of the metabolites produced after the degradation of dyes  Status report on projects supported by DBT  
  54mixture. B. laterosporus  can progressively degrade the dye within short span when combined 
with other dyes in culture; otherwise it needed long time to degrade the same dye when it 
concerned about single dye decolorization. B. laterosporus  have broad spec ificity as it can 
degrade structurally diverse range of dyes with significant reduction in its toxicity and have 
preference in metabolism.  
The decolorization ability of a bacterial -yeast consortium was also tested with two real textile 
effluent having diff erent characteristics and a simulated synthetic effluent made up of five 
different synthetic textile dyes. Consortium decolorized real effluent -1 and 2 with 89 and 60% 
decolorization efficiency respectively within 48 h. In case of simulated synthetic efflu ent, 69% 
decolorization with significant reduction in BOD and COD by consortium, 42 and 16% 
decolorization by G. geotrichum  and B. laterosporus,  respectively were detected. In all the set of 
experiments, decolorizing ability of consortium is much more supe rior to the decolorizing 
capability of individual microorganisms. Cumulative action of oxidoreductive enzyme in 
consortium was found to be responsible for faster decolorization by the same. Fourier Transform 
Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis suggested effective biotransformation of dyes present in 
the simulated synthetic effluent by consortium as compared to individual strains. The core finding 
of this study is the monitoring of release of each dye present in the simulated synthetic effluent 
using High Performance Thin Layer Chromatography (HPTLC). As monitored by HPTLC, 
consortium biodegraded all the dyes except Malachite green within 1 h only. In contrast, G. 
geotrichum  required 4 h to remove the dyes; while up to 16 h of B. laterosporus  treatment, no 
significant change in HPTLC chromatogram was detected. This study dealt with the proficiency 
of consortium over individual microorganisms along with the detailed monitoring of gradual 
biodegradation of each dye from the simulated synthetic effluent. The de colorization efficiency of 
microbial treatment to real effluent 1 was in the order as, consortium > B. laterosporus  > G. 
geotrichum ; however this order was changed to consortium > G. geotrichum  > B. laterosporus in 
case of decolorization of real effluent 2  and simulated synthetic effluent. This suggests that the 
decolorization efficiency of each microbial species varies with the type of pollutant to be reduced.  
BOD/COD ratio of real textile effluent 1 and 2 was increased to 0.35 and 0.32, respectively after  
consortium treatment converting the high strength effluent into easily biodegradable element 
which confirms the effectiveness of consortium. HPTLC analysis helped in monitoring of rapid 
and gradual release of each dye chromophore from the effluent.  
These ecofriendly methods should be used for further applications in large scale studies. But scale 
up of these parameters should be taken into consideration. Hence for application part of these 
studies, we studied the decolorization of various dyes and textile industry effluent using 
immobilized cells of consortium BL -GG. We extended this study be developing two different 
type of bioreactors i.e. Up flow fixed bed reactor (UFFBR) and Triple layered packed bed reactor 
(TLPBR) using immobilized cells and used for continuous decolorization of textile industry 
effluent along with its repeated use. Up flow fixed bed reactor (UFFBR) and Triple layered 
packed bed reactor (TLPBR) showed an average of 93 and 86% efficiency respectively in seven 
days run at flow rate of 10  and 100 ml h-1. We could use these bioreactors for repeated use after 
regeneration of same with nutrient feeding. These studies showed the efficiency and repeated use 
of immobilized cells on applied level.

Results of Project:  Ecotechnology for treating dye waste water of textile industries: A 
demonstration  project  
 
The study has developed an  efficient phytoremediation  technology  for  degradation   of reactive  
azodyes  and  the treated water  can  be recycled  3 times greatly reducing the  requirement of 
water and quantity of effluent discharged.  The treatment involves three steps - primary treatment 
including adjustment of wastewater  characteristics optimal for microbial activities during 
secondary treatment. Secondary treatment in bioreactor will be performed with the help of a 
specialized microbial biofilm developed on the inert matrix. BOD of wastewater is decreased to 
permissible limits in this step and microbial digestion of dyes also reduces colour intensity. The 
partially degraded dyes are mineralized further in wetlands with the help of a different set of 
microbes anchored on the plant roots. This step reduces toxicity of dye w aste water to minimal as 
per CPCB limits and also colour.

The study demonstrated the isolation and identification of new white rot fungus Ganoderma 
cupreum  AG-1 and its immobilization along with laccase in hydrogel of Acrylami de-Alginate 
(Aam - Alg) polymer showed better dye decolourization. It has been noted that the encapsulation 
of enzyme into Aam -Alg hoydrogel works well for immobilization of laccase enzyme with 93.96 
% loading efficiency. The immobilization of Ganoderma cu preum  AG 1 in hydrogel results in 
increased temperature and pH stability and reusability of laccase enzyme.  
 
Results of Project: Development of microbial consortia for the biodegradation and 
biodecolourization of textile effluents  
 
The work describes that  the textile effluent sample was treated using microbial cells immobilized 
in a matrix amended with activated carbon showed good results in terms of color reduction where 
as the organic load reduction was found to be in a similar level as to the sample tre ated under 
aerobic condition. The effluent treated by the consortium was amended with different 
concentrations of carbon and nitrogen compounds as co -metabolites in order to improvise and 
enhance the bioremediation nature of the consortium in decreasing th e lagging time required for 
the synthesis of required necessary enzymes. The consortium was also optimized under different 
physical conditions. When the same consortium was used in the treatment of effluent in an 
industry dealing with reactive dyes, the co nsortium was optimized under different conditions and 
studied for its bioremediation capacity.  
 
7.5 Summary and brief assessment of the results  
With the type of the objectives proposed in the research projects, it was obvious that, very basic 
but necessa ry results were reported. From isolation of strains, study of requirement of carbon and 
other nutritional source, optimization of environmental factors, study of enzymes involved in dye 
decolourization  and degradation, immobilization of whole cells and en zymes, reactor level 
demonstration of treatment efficiency of isolated strains/consortia to isolation and cloning genes 
involved in dye decolourization  were studied and encouraging results were observed and 
reported.  
A very striking and prominent feature was that, though the results from all the projects were 
highly encouraging and reproducible, except couple of study none of them were carried to the 
next level and the lab scale results were only limited to scientific publications.

The status of research supported by national funding agencies, other than DBT for 
developing/demonstrating any novel technology for remedia tion of dye containing textile 
effluents are no different. Isolation of potential microbial strains, development of consortia, 
optimization of media components and environmental factors, study of dye decolourization  and 
degradation pattern (dye degraded i ntermediates), phyto -and genotoxicity analysis, enzymatic 
studies, laboratory scale bioreactor studies on simulated or real textile effluents, etc. are the ve ry 
prominent and repetitive objectives in majority of the research projects. Very few studies were  
directed towards developing any novel methodology for remediation of textile effluents, but they 
are also limited to either lab scale or pre -pilot to pilot level. As is can be seen from the above 
table only Project III, have shown some application at indu stry level, while the academic interest 
are more visible than to develop any feasible technology.    
  
8.5 Analysing the Results  
With the type of objectives proposed in the research projects, following results were reported 
which obviously shows the very basic nature of the work done in this area.  
 
8.5.1 Results of Project I  
The present study dealt with the decolorization and degradation of triphenyl methane textile dye 
by mycelium of Penicillium ochrochloron . Spectrophotometric and visual examinations sh owed 
that the decolorization was through fungal adsorption, followed by degradation.  
Triphenylmethane dyes belong to the most important group of synthetic colorants and are used 
extensively in the textile industries for dying cotton, wool, silk, nylon, etc . They are generally 
considered as the xenobiotic compounds, which are very recalcitrant to 
biodegradation.  Penicillium ochrochloron  decolorizes cotton blue (50  mg l−1) within 2.5  h under 
static condition at pH 6.5 and temperature 25  °C. TLC, FTIR and HPLC  analysis confirms 
biodegradation of cotton blue. FTIR spectroscopy and GC –MS analysis indicated sulphonamide 
and triphenylmethane as the final products of cotton blue degradation. The pH, temperature and Steps involved in textile processing  
  61maturity of biomass affected the rate of decoloriza tion. Presence of lignin peroxidase, tyrosinase 
and aminopyrine N -demethylase activities in the cell homogenate as well as increase in the 
extracellular activity of lignin peroxidase suggests the role of these enzymes in the decolorization  
process. The phy totoxicity and microbial toxicity studies of extracted metabolites suggest the less 
toxic nature of them.  
 Malachite green was detoxified into p -benzyl -N,N-dimethylaniline and N,N -dimethyl -aniline 
hydrochloride by Penicillium ochrochloron. Degradation meta bolites were analyzed by TLC, 
HPLC, and FTIR and identified by GCMS analysis. Phytotoxicity testing revealed the nontoxic 
nature of these metabolites. The percentage decolorization of malachite green (50 mg/L) was 93% 
in czapek dox broth after 14 h with an  optimum pH of 7 at 30ºC. The induction in the activity of 
lignin peroxidase after degradation suggested that the degradation of malachite green was 
peroxidase -mediated. Fungal culture was also found to have detoxified the textile effluent. The 
values of T DS, TSS, COD, and BOD were reduced in the treated samples compared to the control 
effluent. The treated effluent was non -toxic to the plants of Triticum aestivum and Ervum lens 
Linn, and the amount of total chlorophyll was higher in plants with treated eff luent when 
compared to control effluent. This study showed that fungal mycelia could  effectively be used as 
an alternative to the traditional physico -chemical process.  
The main highlight of the project was Penicillium ochrochloron  was found to decolorize t extile 
dye Malachite green, Cotton blue. This study suggests that this strain could be a useful tool for 
textile effluent treatment and the alternative to the traditional physicochemical process.  
 
8.5.2 Results of Project IV  
The study dealt with the decolo rization and degradation of textile dye Reactive blue -25 (0.1 gl-1) 
by mycelium of Aspergillus ochraceus  NCIM -1146. Spectrophotometric and visual examinations 
showed that the decolorization was through fungal adsorption, followed by degradation. Shaking 
condition was found to be better for complete and faster adsorption (7 h) and decolorization               
(20 d) of dye Reactive blue -25 (100 mgl-1) as compared to static condition. Presence of glucose in 
medium showed faster adsorption (4 h) and decoloriza tion of dye from bound (7 d) mycelium. 
FTIR and GCMS analysis study revealed biodegradation of Reactive blue -25 into two metabolites 
phthalimide and di -isobutyl phthalate.  
Aspergillus ochraceus (NCIM -1146) has ability to decolorise various textile dyes viz . Purple 2R, 
Orange TG22, Yellow HE64, Red HERB and Golden yellow HER was determined by monitoring 
the decrease in absorbance of each dye in the culture supernantant. Decolorization performance of 
Purple 2R with various conditions such as different media, concentration of dye, agitation and 
static condtions were studied. The decrease in dye decolorization capability of mycelium was 
observed with increasing dye concentration in repeated batch mode. Spectrophotometric data 
revealed that the process involved i n decolorization is through microbial metabolism but not 
biosorption. Phytotoxicity study demonstrated no toxicity of the biodegradated products for plants 
with respect to Phaseoulus mungo  and Sorghum vulgare . 
Aspergillus ochraceus (NCIM -1146) has ability to decolorize various xenobiotic dyes. 
Biodegradation of dyes was demonstrated by their decolorisation in the culture medium. The 
extent of biodegradation was determined by monitoring the decrease in absorbance of each dye. 
Malachite green decolorisation a ctivity is affected by various conditions such as composition of 
media, concentration of dye, amount of mycelia and agitation. The durability of decolorisation 
activity under optimum conditions was investigated in repeated batch mode. An increase in the Steps involved in textile processing  
  62amount of mycelia positively affected the durability of decolorisation activity. The decrease in 
dye decolorisation capability of mycelia occurred with increasing dye concentration in repeated 
batch mode. This organism showed significant ability to decoloriz e all the dyes tested viz. 
malachite green (98%), cotton blue (92%), methyl violet (61%) and crystal violet (57%) in 24 h 
incubation. Spectrophotometric data revealed that the process involved in decolorisation is 
through microbial metabolism but not bioso rption. This study showed that fungal mycelia (A. 
ochraceus) could effectively be used as an alternative to the traditional physico -chemical process.  
The main highlight  of the work was, Aspergillus ochraceus  NCIM -1146 was found to decolorize 
textile dye Re active blue -25, Purple 2R, Malachite green, Cotton blue, Methyl violet and Crystal 
violet. This study suggests that this strain could be a useful tool for textile effluent treatment a nd 
the alternative to the traditional physicochemical process.  
 
8.5.3 Res ults of Project VI  
Growth of B. laterosporus : The exponential phase of B. laterosporus  started after 12 h of 
incubation and continued up to 72 h at 30oC. The status of the biotransformation enzymes was 
found to be optimum at 36 h of incubation which was th e mid exponential phase. These results 
probed the use of Brevibacillus  culture at its mid exponential phase for dye decolorization studies.  
Decolorization of dyes using B. laterosporus  and the effect of physico -chemical parameters:  
GY-HE2R and NB -3G showe d 87% and 80% decolorization respectively, within 48 h under static 
condition at 50 mgl-1 concentration. However, no significant change in the decolorization 
potential was observed under shaking conditions. Decolorization performance of all the dyes GY -
HE2R and NB -3G was decreased with an increase in the initial dye concentrations from 0.1 to 1.0 
g l-1. B. laterosporus  steeply decreased the decolorization of Golden Yellow -HE2R and Navy 
Blue -3G at the concentration 1.0 g l-1 with poor performance even after extended incubation (46 
and 66%, respectively within 72 h).  
In case of Navy Blue -3G, better performance of decolorization was observed in the quite broad 
range of pH 7.0 to 11.0; however decolorization of Golden Yellow -HE2R was found in the 
broader range ( pH 5.0 to 9.0). In present study, B. laterosporus  exhibited maximum 
decolorization at 30 °C whereas in case of Golden Yellow -HE2R and Navy Blue -3G, more than 
60% of the dye was removed even at 15 °C, after an extended incubation period.  Studies show 
that B. laterosporus  has better decolorization activity of the two studied dyes during its 
exponential growth phase. The organism showed more efficient decolorization in 24 -96 h old 
cultures. When 40 mg l-1 wet weight of the culture was used, the time required for complete 
decolorization of GY -HE2R and NB -3G was reduced to 18 h and 12 h respectively. Moreover, 
nitrogen sources  were found to be stimulatory for the decolorization activity as compared to the 
studied carbon and phosphorus sources. KH 2PO 4 and NaH 2PO 4 were found to have no significant 
effect on the decolorization of GY -HE2R and NB -3G. Among the carbon sources studied, starch 
was better source whereas in presence of glucose, the cells have shown poor decolorization in all 
the cases. Complete decolorizat ion of dyes occurred simply in the synthetic medium (without any 
supplementary components) when provided with an extended incubation.  
The organism retained good dye decolorization abilities even when used in repeated cycles. The 
growth of B. laterosporus  was remarkably increased during the decolorization of GY -HER and 
NB-3G (45 and 56% respectively) after 24 h of incubation; whereas it decreased (18%) during the 
decolorization of GY -HER after the further incubation up to 72 h.  Steps involved in textile processing  
  63Decrease in the activity of t yrosinase (31%), no significant change in the activity of laccase 
whereas significant increase in the activities of LiP (156%), aminopyrine N -demethylase (120%), 
DCIP reductase (76%) and MG reductase (40%) was found in the cell free extract obtained after 
48 h of incubation during the decolorization of Golden Yellow -HER by B. laterosporus . 
Complete inhibition of tyrosinase, no significant change in the activities of laccase and DCIP 
reductase where as significant increase in the activities of LiP (54%), aminopyrine N -demethylase 
(122%), and MG reductase (50%) was found in the cell free extract obtained after 48 h of 
incubation during the decolorization of Navy Blue -3G by B. laterosporus . In addition, no 
significant change during the decolorization of GY -HER,  significant decrease (8%) during the 
decolorization of NB -3G where as significant increase (~10%) during the decolorization of MG 
and MR was observed in the activity of LiP in to the culture supernatant (i.e. extracellular). No 
activities of laccase, tyro sinase as well as DCIP reductase, MG reductase and aminopyrine N -
demethylase were found in to the culture supernatant. The findings of microbial and phytotoxicity 
studies suggest that B. laterosporus  produces nontoxic metabolites with respect to the tested 
microorganisms and plants.  
 
Analysis of products formed after the degradation of GY -HE2R: TLC chromatogram shown 
single spot (Rf = 0.98) of control GY-HER , whereas three different spots (Rf = 0.83, 0.78 and 
0.71) and single spot (Rf = 0.91) of the degradat ion products extracted after 24 and 48 h 
respectively. HPLC chromatogram of control Golden Yellow -HE2R showed a single peak at the 
retention time 1.593, whereas three different peaks of degradation products extracted after 24 h at 
the retention time 2.618,  2.707 and 2.932 and two peaks of the degradation products extracted 
after 48 h at the retention time 2.299 and 2.453. Overall findings suggest degradation as well as 
further biotransformation of the dye.  
FTIR spectrum of control dye displayed a peak at 34 31 cm-1 for N -H stretch, a peak at 2924 cm-1 
for CH 3 stretch, a peak at 1574 cm-1 for –N=N - stretch, a peak at 1487 cm-1 for ring vibrations, a 
peak at 671 cm-1 for C -H bend, a peak at 1188 cm-1 for SO 2 stretch where as peaks at 1082, and 
1039 cm-1 for C -N stretch as well as a peak at 615 cm-1 for C -Cl stretch suggested aromatic azo 
nature of the dye and confirmed its chemical structure. FTIR spectrum of degradation products 
displayed the peaks at 3241, 1330, and 1106 cm-1 suggested the formation of N -N-disubstituted 
sulfonamides from the parent dye molecules. Disappearance of a peak at 1574 cm-1 for an azo 
stretch clearly indicated the breaking of azo bond by B. laterosporus  that would be an essential 
and foremost step for the color removal. A peak at 1236 cm-1 for C -N stretch of Ar–NH–R 
suggests the formation of aromatic amines.  
Biotransformation was further confirmed by HPLC chromatogram that has shown three peaks of 
degradation products extracted after 24 h with the retention time 2.252, 2.473 and 2.697 whereas 
two peaks of degradation products extracted after 48 h with the retention time 2.256 and 2.474. 
Disappearance of all peaks of the control dye confirmed the degradation of the Navy Blue -3G as 
well as its contaminants.  
FTIR spectrum of control Navy B lue-3G displayed a peak at 3430 cm-1 for N -H stretch, a peak at 
2923 cm-1 for C -H stretch, a peak at 1738 cm-1 for –O–N=O stretch, a peak at 1698 cm-1 for 
>C=O stretch, a peak at 1606 cm-1 for ring vibrations, a peak at 1513 cm-1 for Ar –N=O stretch of 
arom atic nitro compound, a peak at 1328 cm-1 for C –N stretch of Ar –NH–R, a peak at 1174 cm-1 
for asymmetric ring vibrations, a peak at 1039 cm-1 for –C–O–C stretch and a peak at 614 cm-1 
for C –Br stretch confirmed the chemical structure of dye. FTIR spectrum o f the degradation 
products extracted after 48 h retained the peaks at 3240 and 1671 cm-1 for –N=O stretch suggests Steps involved in textile processing  
  64that nitroso compounds remained unvanished up to longer period. A peak at 1514 cm-1 for Ar –
N=O stretch of aromatic nitro compound stretch whe re as various peaks in the fingerprint region 
for mono and di -substituted benzene rings confirmed the formation of aromatic nitrosamines (Fig. 
6). A pathway has been proposed for the degradation of NB -3G based on GCMS analysis. 
Bromo -benzene (m/z 156, peak  1; m -2 = 154), ester substituted aniline derivative (m/z = 178, 
peak 2), meta -di nitro benzene (m/z 167, peak 3; m+1 = 168) and ortho  benzene aniline derivative 
(m/z 169, peak 4; m+1 = 170) are the elected products.  
Decolorization of textile effluent : 100  ml batch culture of the organism decolorized 35% of 
textile effluent within 24 h.  Approximately 5 g (wet wt) of the immobilized beads kept in 250 ml 
effluent under static condition (in 500 ml beaker) decolorized about 60% of the effluent within 24 
h and r etained 50% decolorization efficiency upto 5 cycles.   
Purification of intracellular lignin peroxidase: A total amount of about 280 mg of protein, 
corresponding to approximately 86 units of lignin peroxidase was loaded onto the column. This 
ion exchange col umn chromatography allowed the recovery of 35.55 units in 1.98 mg of protein 
with a yield of 40% and purification factor of approximately 57 fold. Although homogeneity was 
obtained and confirmed by PAGE, elution of enzyme from fraction number 39 to 69 (i.e . broad 
range) suggested the presence of multiple binding sites with different ionizable groups. In the 
present study, PAGE gel developed by Coomassie brilliant blue staining has shown single band 
for a protein having molecular weight about 205 kDa where t he molecular weight of an enzyme 
was estimated using MW -standard markers. Moreover, PAGE gel developed by the activity 
staining using L -DOPA has shown only one band at the same run as that of developed by 
Coomassie brilliant blue staining. The enzyme was a ctive throughout a broad range of 
temperature, its optimum temperature being 40oC while its optimum pH was found to be 4.5. 
Maximum activity of the enzyme was observed with 750 mM concentration of tartaric acid. 
Lignin peroxidase from the B. laterosporus  was found to be dependent on H 2O2 since no activity 
exhibited in the absence H 2O2. Continuous increase in lignin peroxidase activity with the 
increasing concentration of H 2O2 from a range 10 mM to 1 M was observed. The Km value of the 
enzyme was found to be  1.6 mM.  
FTIR spectrum of the degradation products of Golden Yellow -HE2R formed by purified lignin 
peroxidase displayed a peak at 1720 cm-1 for carbonyl stretch, a peak at 1443 cm-1 for an 
asymmetric bend of –CH 3 of alkyl benzene derivative, a peak at 670 cm-1 for C -H bend of 
benzene, a peak at 1276 cm-1 for –C–O–C–asymmetric stretch whereas the peak at 2929 cm-1 for 
C-H stretch of methyl group suggests the formation of aryl ethers by the transformation of dye.  
The major highlights of the project was to exp lores the dye degrading abilities of B. laterosporus , 
with studies of the basic underlying mechanisms behind the removal of the dyes, GY -HE2R, NB -
3G and textile effluents. The intracellular enzymes as well as whole cell systems can be used as 
effective bio remediating agent.

9.1.1 Case Study I  
 
(A) Environment Services Co -Operative Society Ltd., Vatva  
      (Common Effluent Treatment Plant)  
 
Vatva industrial estate (VIE) is one of the oldest and pioneering industrial setup in the state of 
Gujarat, started its operation in the year 1960, is spreaded over 572 hectares of land housing 
approximately 2100 small, medium and large industrial units. Dye and dye intermediates are the 
major units in the estate with 356 units, 90 unites are manufacturing chemicals and 12 industries 
are involved in textile production, while remaining ind ustries are involved in plastics and rubbers, 
engineering, pharmaceuticals, foundry, metal treatment, paint and varnish, steel and furnace 
production .      
It is obvious that dye, dye intermediates and textile units are the major source of pollution in th e 
estate. For the treatment of liquid and solid wastes, member industries in the estate have 
established Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP), which operates as Green Environment 
Services Co -Operative Society Ltd. (GESCSL) in the year 1992. Nearly 90 % o f the effluents 
treated in the CETP are from dyes, intermediates, textiles and chemicals. The operating capacity 
of the CETP is 16 MLD, with annual running cost of Rs. 2400 lakhs. It is spread on a land area of 
20,000 m3.   
 
A.1 Treatment Technology  
The ba sic treatment facility in the CETP is conventional primary and secondary treatment with 
extended aeration facility. The basic design for process and operation (including technology) was 
provided by M/s. Advent Corporation, USA, based on the treatability st udy carried out by M/s. 
Sudarshan Chemical Industries Ltd., Pune. The detailed engineering and setup outlay was 
provided by M/s. Sudarshan Chemical Industries Ltd., Pune. The complete plant commissioning 
CETP and overall expert supervision was provided by M/s. Advent Envirocare Technology Pvt. 
Ltd., Ahmedabad.   
 
A.2 Salient Features  
The CETP was designed and works on AIS (Advent integral system) technology. The system 
contains aeration basin surrounded by integrated peripheral secondary clarifier. During t he up -
gradation after few years of the programme, integral clarifier was converted into aeration zone 
and two separate secondary clarifiers were additional added. The aeration is provided by medium 
bubble aeration grid supplemented with 12 distinct Triton type aerators supplied by M/s. Aeration 
Industries International Inc., Minneapolis, USA.  
The handling capacity (basic parameters) of the CETP is 16000 m3/day of inflow effluent, and 
can treat effluent having COD of 3000 mg/L, BOD of 1200 mg/L with TSS of 6 00 mg/L.   
 
A. 3 Effluent Collection and Conveyance System  
The effluents from 674 members are conveyed to CETP from individual industrial units through 
underground (internal) collection system  consisting of rising mains. Flow -meters and auto -
samplers are i nstalled at each inlet pipelines to monitor and measure the inlet effluent parameters. 
Treated wastewater from CETP is conveyed to Domestic effluent (sewage) treatment plant of National and International case studies  
  67Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation at Pirana through closed pipeline of ‘Naroda Pi rana Pipeline 
Project’. The wastewater is mixed with domestic (treated) sewage to meet with the TDS 
parameter, before discharging into Sabarmati River.  
 
A.4 Treatment Process  
As noted above CETP works with primary physico -chemical treatment and secondary  biological 
treatment. It is mandatory for all 674 member units to provide initial primary treatment (to the 
effluent) in their industrial units, in order to meet the inlet norms (as mentioned above) of the 
CETP. A unique effluent collection network system  is established by CETP. Effluents from the 
individual units (through overhead tank) are collected in a collection room termed as “SUMP 
Room”. Currently, there are 94 such SUMP rooms are constructed, where in an each SUMP room 
maximum of eight pipelines fo r as many industries are converged, having flow -meter and auto -
sampler for each pipelines. From every SUMP room, again through network of pipelines, 
effluents are conveyed to Pumping Station which is finally channeled into CETP. A schematic 
diagram of the complete outlay of the system network is displayed in Figure 9.1 . Another notable 
feature of the entire effluent collection system is a specific time slot is provided to individual 
units for the discharge of their primarily treated effluents; also the quan tity of the flow is defined 
and measured regularly.        
After entering into the CETP, effluents are collected, sampled and pumped to an equalization 
tank. Heterogeneous effluents in the equalization basins are mixed through an aeration grid for 
homogeni zing the entire content in the basin. These homogenous effluents are pumped into the 
flash mixer where chemical additive and supplements are added and effluent flows to flocculator. 
By natural gravity the flocculator overflow goes to the Dissolve Air Flota tion (DAF) unit. It 
works on the principal of super saturation of the liquid with dissolved air, which is achieved by 
mixing pressurized recycled wastewater and external compressed air. The saturated recycled 
wastewater flow is released in DAF tank at abou t atmospheric pressure forming fine bubbles.  
The solids particles from the top and the bottom of the tank are separated by scrapper are 
collected in the sludge holding tank and sent to centrifuge decanter for dewatering and final 
disposal at Vinzol secure d landfill site.  
Post-primary treatment, through natural gravity, influent from the DAF tank flows to aeration 
basin (having a holding capacity of 20600 m3). In aeration basin, organic matters of the 
wastewater are aerobically degraded by activated sludge  in extended aeration regime. Course 
bubbled diffused aeration is provided to maintain the Dissolved Oxygen levels in the basin and 
also MLSS in the suspension from. The aeration basin plant is programmed and designed to 
operate at an F/M of 0.12 based on BOD/MLVSS.      
The treated effluents from aeration basin are pumped into Dispersion Transition and Flocuulation 
(DTF) channel by two air lift pump (with maximum capacity of 900 m3/h). In the channel air is 
lifted along with the liquid and dispersed by pro viding zig -zag baffles to create turbulence in the 
flow to allow entrap air to escape. The baffles also help in mixing mixed liquor with 
polyelectrolytes for enhancing the flocculation. To separate the biomass from the treated 
wastewater, mixed liquor is f ed to the integrated secondary clarifier though a distribution network 
and rest of the flow is re -circulated to the aeration basin. The portion of the collected concentrated 
biomass is recycled from clarifier to the aeration basin through a bottom hopper, while the 
remaining biomass is transferred to centrifugal decanter for dewatering.  National and International case studies

At the end of the wastewater treatment in CETP, as noted above the treated wastewater is 
conveyed to Domestic treatment plant and mixed with domestic (sewage) effluent to m eet the 
TDS norms for final discharge in to Sabarmati River.                  
To access the treatment efficiency of CETP, Vatva, an earlier detailed study is discussed here, 
where physico -chemical characteristics of wastewaters from nine dyes and dye inter mediates 
manufacturing industries and one from CETP was analyzed. The values of twenty different 
parameters from nine industries (I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, X) and CETP outlet (CO) are 
listed in Appendix I. The schematic outlay of the treatment proc ess is as described in Figure 9.1.

9.1.2  Case Study II  
B.1 Sivasakthi Textile Processors, Tirupur, Tamilnadu   
The river Noyyal (tributary to river Cauvery) harbors the city of Tirupur, in Coimbatore District 
in the state of Tamilnadu, which is well known for its cotton fabric production. It was found that 
quality of water of the river and the climatic conditions has been ideal for dyeing operation of  
fabric and yarn. The city houses about 748 dyeing and bleaching industries that generates over 
90,000 m3/day of wastewater. Looking to amount of daily discharge of dyeing effluent 20 CETPs 
are in operation treating wastewater from 502 industries, while ot her industries are having local 
treatment plants. They were able to remove color and other organic compounds to the set 
stipulated standards; however treatment technology failed to arrest the inorganic contaminants. National and International case studies  
  69Both treated and untreated textile efflu ents are discharged in the river causing the loss of pristine 
ecosystem.   
 
B.2 The Case of Sivasakthi Textile Processor  
The textile industrial unit at Sivasakthi has six batch flow reactors for dyeing (i.e. wetting, 
bleaching, neutralizing, washing, colo uring, washing, etc.) of different capacities. One ton of 
cotton yarn requires 10 m3 of water, whereas 1 ton of polyester yarn consumes only 4 m3 in each 
steps. For dyeing process, it requires alkali and sodium salt. The quantity of salt (mostly sodium 
chloride) used is usually depends on the requirement of shade of the colour to be applied. The 
daily production capacity of the unit is 1500 – 2000 kg fabric and the volume of effluent 
generated is of the order of 100 – 200 m3/day. The effluents generated are  segregated into dye 
bath wastewater and wash water and treated accordingly.  
In primary treatment plant, wash water is collected in holding tanks for flask mixing and addition 
of slurries of lime and ferrous sulphate with effluent and allowed for settling . Following the 
primary treatment, effluent is pumped in sequential manner to pressure sand filter, iron removal 
filter, ion exchange filter and reverse osmosis (RO) system. (The treatment facilities also possess 
double stage RO system, each with six spira l wound membranes. Pump pressure is maintained in 
the range of 21.2 –28.2 kg/cm2. The filtrate of first stage RO system is sent to second RO and the 
final reject (~ 20 %) is carried to Multi Effect Evaporator (MEE). The condensate water from 
MEE process is recycled in the cleaning operations. The treated effluent from MEE having 100 
g/L solid content is allowed for solar evaporation.  
The wastewater from dye bath water collected in a separate tank is pre -filtration (essentially 
required to increase the self -life of the nano -membrane) followed by nanofiltration. Nearly 30 % 
of the non -filtered waste water is carried for multi effect evaporation (MEE) and solar 
evaporation systems (SES). At the end of the process permeate is usually used for preparation of 
dye bath solution.  
A typical schematic diagram of the effluent treatment plant provided with primary, secondary and 
advanced treatment technologies for recycling of wastewater is presented in the Figure 9.2.  National and International case studies

recycling of textile dyeing wastewaters  
The characteristics of the raw effluents, intermediate effluents and permeate are presented in the 
table 1&2. It can be observed that low hardness of pe rmeate is an added advantage in the process. 
Reject of NF filtration contains 4.8 % salts that is mixed with more salts and used in the process. 
Salt recovery from the dye bath alone has 50 % returns.

B.3 Cost analysis and viability of the water recycling process  
The cost  of installing fully functional unit and it final commissioning cost in the range of Rs. 40 – 
100 lakhs for small scale (< 300m3/day), Rs. 100 – 200 lakhs for medium scale (300 – 600 
m3/day) and Rs. 200 – 300 lacs for large scale (> 600 m3/day) scale texti le dying industries. Also 
the maintenance and operation cost is high as can be seen in the Table 9.3  
 National and International case studies  
  72Table 9.3:  Operating and Maintenance cost of the wastewater treatment plant  
Cost  Currency (INR)  
Chemical cost  7 – 8 /m3 
Power cost  2 – 3 /m3 
Sludge han dling  0.75 – 1 /m3 
Manpower  1 – 2 /m3 
Filters/cartridges (spares)  5 – 10 /m3 
RO/NF membrane maintenance  15 – 20 /m3 
 
The total expenses for the water treatment and recovery is estimated around Rs. 80/m3 of the raw 
effluent. Due to excessive use to fres h water, the quality of water in Tirupur is not good for 
dyeing processes. Hence, it is purchased from villages located at 15 km away from the treatment 
facility that further adds to the cost approximately to Rs. 100/m3 (including transportation).  
The ope rating cost of MEE and maintenance of RO membrane module are very high. MEE 
proves to be costly system for concentration of the effluents and it requires more maintenance and 
also consumes more fuel at an average of Rs. 400 per m3 of premate. The recovered  salt has poor 
purity and market value of salt is also very less (Rs. 4/kg).  To reduce the chocking of RO 
membrane proper preliminary treatments is required. The advantage of this treatment technology 
is that, recovered water from the membranes is with ex tremely low hardness, which is always a 
prime requirement of textile sector for an improved finish and better quality dyeing. The 
treatment and maintenance cost is around Rs. 80/m3, cheaper than the input water cost (Rs. 
100/m3).  
 
9.2 International Case S tudies   
9.2.1 Case Study III: Malaysia  
Textile industries are one of the major industrial sectors in the Asian continent. India, China, 
Bangladesh, Malaysia, etc. are leading manufacturer and exporter of natural and synthetic textiles. 
Amongst them Malays ia contributes to nearly 1.3 % of synthetic textile (fibers) of the total 
world’s production. Malaysia’s textile industry has already crossed US$ 5 billion in terms of their 
export. The obvious immediate significant impact is seen in terms of environmental  quality. In 
Malaysia, every textile industrial unit treats its own effluents and treated wastewaters are 
normally released to a drain. Therefore, it is mandatory for the industries to treat high polluted 
wastewater to meet the legislative requirement.  
Three different case studies are discussed below in brief to understand the textile effluent 
treatment facilities existing in the Malaysia and any lesson to be learned. In a state of Penang, 
majority of textile industries use biological methods for the treat ment of their wastewater. A 
representative technology is as described in flow -chart (Figure 9.3). Coloured and non -coloured 
wastewater are separately collected from (a) fabric pre -treatment, (b) dyeing and printing and (c) 
fabric finishing steps into a ind ividual equalization tank. For non -coloured wastewater, biological National and International case studies  
  73
treatment is followed by equalization step and sludge obtained after biological treatment is sent 
for sludge dewatering, whereas treated water is released into the drain. For coloured waste water, 
post equalization, the effluent is treated in decolourization plant followed by sludge dewatering 
and final disposal.      
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 9.3 : A diagrammatic flow chart for treatment technology employed in Textile Industries in 
Malaysi a  
While in a state of Sembilan, in many textile industries biological treatments are followed by 
initial physico -chemical treatment. A typical flow -chart of methodology employed for treatment 
of raw textile wastewater in described in Figure 9.4. Raw texti le wastewater is treated in 
equalization tank followed by coagulation and flocculation treatment. The treated effluents are 
sent to clarifier and in buffer tank (for possible adjustment of pH of the effluent) followed by 
biological treatment. In biological  treatment two stages aeration are provided. Post -aeration, 
portion of the treated effluent is send to sludge holding tank, while remaining fraction of the 
treated wastewater final disposal after holding time in clarifier. Effluent from sludge holding tank  
undergoes filter press (for dewatering) for final disposal in drain.

In a third case study, a treatme nt technology is described from a small/medium scale textile 
industry, Siang Poh Knitting Sdn. Bhd., located in Kuala Lumpur. A diagrammatic representation 
of the technology used is described in Figure 9.5. Industry has its own Wastewater treatment 
facilit y operating since 1994, which follows Standard Activated Sludge Process (Physical, 
Chemical treatment followed by Biological treatment) for wastewater treatment from dyeing 
process.  National and International case studies  
  75The facility has a capacity of handling 96 m3/day of wastewater and follow s three stage treatment 
procedure. The annual overall chemical consumption for drying process of the industry is 4,000 
kg/day.  
 
Figure 9.5 : A diagrammatic flow chart for treatment technology employed in Textile Industries in 
Malaysia  
 
In a chemical (pri mary) treatment step, raw textile wastewater is treated in coagulation and 
flocculation tank (a single time application) followed by neutralization and holing phage in 
primary settling tank (for separation of sludge). In a secondary (biological) stage, was tewater 
from primary settling stage is channeled into aeration tank for biological treatment (for possible 
reduction of biological oxygen demand and organic residues of the effluent). Post aeration, 
treated wastewater is channeled into secondary settling s tage for sludge settlement. A small 
quantity of sludge is retained back in aeration tank for next cycle of biological treatment, while 
the reaming sludge is transfer into sludge drying pit. After another stage of neutralization, in a 
tertiary (polishing st ep) treatment, treated wastewater is passed through adsorption column 
packed with activated carbon, before final discharge of treated water.  
The industry claims that, after providing the above treatments to raw textile effluent, 97 % of 
Suspended Solids, 99 % of Biological Oxygen Demand and 99 % of Chemical Oxygen Demand 
(of low/medium strength influent wastewater) are removed. The operating and maintenance cost 
of treatment facility was projected at RM 170,000.00, which is equivalent to US$ 41600.00 and 
INR 26,00,000.00 (at a current currency exchange value). The water reproduced after the above 
treatment complies with DOC Standard A of effluent discharge standard legalized in the country.   
From these treatment plants, it can be concluded that conventiona l treatment systems such as 
biological treatment alone or physicochemical treatments followed by a biological treatment are 
commonly installed in majority textile industries. The single application of coagulation and 
flocculation processes to treat textile  effluents would generate high amount of sludge to 
eventually cause further handling and disposable problems.  
Meanwhile, conventional biological process do not always treat the  textile wastewater 
satisfactorily  as the effluents often contain organic substa nces which are toxic and resistant to 
organism used in biological treatment. Only one of the textile effluents was further treated using 
  National and International case studies  
  76advanced treatment method (i.e., adsorption column packed with activated carbon) to comply 
with the standard  for an eff luent discharge or to prepare the treated effluent for reuse purpose. 
Therefore, suitable combinations of treatment processes are generally used in textile industry to 
achieve technically and economically feasible options.  
 
9.2.2 Case study IV  
C.1 Study of  a Treatment Plant in Germany  
This treatment plant is an activated sludge system with low food -to-microorganism ratio (F/M). It 
receives municipal wastewater and effluent from four large textile finishing mills. The textile 
wastewater is equalised and then  mixed with primarily treated municipal waste water. The 
hydraulic percentage of textile wastewater is about 45 % and referring to COD -load about 60 %. 
Subsequent to primary treatment and equalisation, there is a biological treatment including 
nitrificatio n / denitrification and flocculation with FeCl 3 as final step.

The municipal sewage is treated in primary treatment unit before mixing with the textile 
wastewater. The textile effluent is passed through bar screen to remove large waste material  and 
then passed through a grit chamber to remove the smaller material. The water is then pumped to National and International case studies  
  77an equalisation tank (one standby equalisation tank) and the wastewater is then mixed with the 
primarily treated municipal wastewater and passes to the neut ralisation tank. The waste is then 
diluted and neutralized using H 2SO 4 or NaOH. Then the wastewater is treated using the activated 
sludge process and since it has a low F/M ratio longer retention time and aeration is required. The 
water is then passed to t he secondary clarifiers after which FeCl 3is added to destabilize the 
colloidal materials and cause the small particles to agglomerate into larger settleable flocs, thus 
aiding the coagulation and flocculation process. The treated effluent is then directly discharged to 
the river.  
The removable efficiencies are shown in Table 9.5. This system is able to meet European and 
Germany’s National discharge regulatory standard.

C.2 Sludge management  
Sludge from clarifier and precipitation and flocculation chamber is treated with centrifuge before 
sludge storage tank. Sludge from primary sedim ent tank used in municipal wastewater treatment 
is also sent to the sludge storage tank. The sludge is then mixed and it is passed through chamber 
filter press to separate the liquid phase from the solid phase. The solid phase is then transported to 
a slud ge drying bed.

  8611.1 Opening Remarks  
Textile industry is backbone of Indian Socio -Economy development, lik e agriculture. It is one 
of the oldest industrial sectors, largest and having prominent global presence. Textile industry in 
India is highly fragment, complex and distributed into localized clustered across all states of the 
country.   
  
11.2 Structure of India Textile Industry  
Textile industry in our country is divided into (i) Organized (formal) sector (~ 3 %) and                     
(ii) Unorganized (informal) sector (~ 97 %) (Figure 11.1). The organized but small sector is 
advanced, modernized and high ly sophisticated Mill based. The large portion of Indian textile 
industry has been formed by large unorganized sector, segregated into handloom, powerloom and 
hosiery based units. A third sector also runs parallel to these both sector is ‘sub -contracting 
segment’. It is composed of small tailoring and fabrication units, which operates under a defined 
and specified contract from parent units.   
 
 
Figure 11.1 : Structure of Indian Textile Industrial Sector  
 
Textile production is broadly classified into five stages: ginning, spinning (yarn), weaving & 
knitting (fabrics), dying and processing and garments.  
Spinning : It consists of more than 1,100 small -scale independent units and > 1,500 large - scale 
independent units.  
Weaving and Knitting : India’s weaving and  knitting segment is small scale and highly 
fragmented. It consists of handlooms, powerlooms and knitting technologies. Handloom segment 
is mainly rurally situated, powerlooms are traditionally prerogative of composite mills, while knit 
based segment are g eographically concentrated centers like in Triuppur. The sector consist of Indian Textile

  87nearly 3.9 millions handlooms, and once used to 3,80,000 powerlooms (this segment is gradually 
phased out).    
Processing (Fabric Finishing) : Processing segments includes dyeing, pr inting and other cloth 
preparation prior final production of clothing. Small -scale and independent enterprises dominate 
this segment. About 2300 processors are currently operating, amongst them 2100 are independent 
units and 200 are integrated with spinnin g, weaving or knitting units.    
Clothing : Apparel (clothing) segment consist of about 77,000 small -scale units, (as domestic and 
exporters manufacturers, fabricators (as (subcontractors). In organized sector nearly 65,000 
garment units are estimated.  
 
Salient Features of Indian Textile Industry  
 It is second largest in the world, after China.  
 India contributes to 60 % of total loomage of total world production, making it highest in the 
globe  
 India has 22 % of total world’s spindle capacity, making its se cond -highest in the globe

national companies  
 Dominated by small -scale domains across the value chain  
 Many portion of the sector is decentralized and dominated by handloom and independent 
processing un its 
 Abundant availability of raw materials  
 
11.3 Geographical Distribution of textile industry   
As noted above, textile industry is widespread across the country, in forms of clusters, parks, 
SEZs, etc. According to CPCB, New Delhi report there is nearly 140 textile clusters in India. 
Major and prominent clusters are situated in the state of Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, 
Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, besides many small clusters is located in other states too.  
 
11.3.1 Punjab  
In the state of Pun jab, three major cities, Ludhina, Amritsar, Panipat are hubs of textile and 
related industries.   
Ludhina may be called as “Manchester of Punjab”. The textile industry is in the form of small 
scale segments, mainly producing hosiery items. Textile units in  Amritsar are based on cotton and 
yarn. Panipat is famous for cotton fabric production.    
 
11.3.2 Haryana  
Haryana is leading state in cotton production in India, which gives added advantage to the state in 
textile industry. The centres like Hisar, Panipat , Sonipat, Gurugram, Faridabad are major hub for 
textile industry in Haryana.

11.4 Textile Wastewater Management  
Textile wastewater management in our country is inspired from the European and Western 
countries. Along the line of successful practices in those countries, many technologies were 
adopted and trans lated into Indian sub -continent. These technologies revolve around physico -
chemical and biological treatment methods.  
The treatment steps in CETPs and ETPs across the country follows primary, secondary and 
tertiary stages for treatment of textile and dye industrial effluents. In the state of Tamil Nadu, 
Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) practice is widely used.  
 
11.5 Textile effluent treatment technologies in three states of India  
 
11.5.1 Gujarat     
(A) Vapi Green Enviro Ltd., Vapi CEPT, Vapi  
The CETP at Vapi  Industrial Estate, Vapi, Gujarat (one of the largest in Asia) operates on 
conventional biological treatment plant (Figure 11.2). The industrial effluents from individual 
member units were colleted at CETP through pipeline. Effluents are treated in three s tage process: 
during initial primary process, effluents are screen for large particulate matter in screening 
chamber, followed by equalization treatment (by addition of lime), flax mixing and flocculation. 
In second stage, through primary clarifier the par t of pre -processed effluent are send for aerobic 
treatment in aeration tank and another part of pre -processed effluent are feed to UASB reactor. Textile Clusters of India and Waste Management Practices  
  90After aerobic treatment through secondary clarifier the treated effluents are released into Daman 
Ganga River.

(B) The Green Environment Services Co -Op. Society, Vatva CEPT, Vatva, Ahmedabad  
Like CETP in Vapi, CETP at Vatva Industrial Estate operates on co nventional biological 
treatment method. Partially treated effluent from individual member units are collected at CEPT 
through pipe line. Post primary treatment through clarifier, equalization, flash mixer and 
flocculator, effluents are treated under aerati on conditions in activated sludge aeration tank. In 
third stage, during tertiary treatment after passing through secondary clarifier, treated effluent a re 
send to land filing sites and at terminal pumping station for final release in ocean. The schematic 
outlay of Vatva CETP is as describe in Figure 11.3         Textile Clusters of India and Waste Management Practices

11.5.2  Maharashtra  
 
(A) Greenfield CET Plant P vt. Ltd., Solapur, Maharashtra   
The CETP plant at Solapur, Maharashtra works with conventional biological treatment plant 
(Figure 11.4). The three stages of effluent treatment technology are: initial collection and 
screening process followed by primary equ alization process, the second stage consists of 
biological treatment in Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket Reactor followed by aerobic process in 
aeration tank. In the last stage, generated sludge is sent to clarifier and sludge drying beds. The 
CEPT treats t he industrial effluents for large and medium size textile industries, effluents from 
chemical and bulk drugs and oil refinery.

Lote- Parshuram is industrialized zone, in Ratnagiri district in the state of Maharashtra, 
comprising more than 200 industries (small, medium and large industries units). The clusters 
mainly produce dyes intermediates, agro chemicals, specialty chemicals and bulk drugs. Effluents 
from these industries are treated by CETP which operates on conventional technology (Figure 
11.5).  Textile Clusters of India and Waste Management Practices  
  93
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 11.5 : Flow diagram of Lote Parshuram CETP, Lot e, Maharashtra  
The three stage process involves: initial effluent collection from member industrial units through 
pipeline to storage tank at CETP, followed by neutralization of effluents using Lime, which is fed 
to primary sedimentation tank through flash  mixture. In second stage (secondary treatment), pre -
treated effluents are feed to bioreactors for biological treatment followed by separation of sludge 
in secondary sedimentation tank. In a final stage (tertiary treatment), biologically treated effluen t 
is feed to oxidation pond and pressure charcoal bed filters.  
Sludge generated during each step of effluent treatment is transferred to sludge holding tank, 
which after poly addition the mixture is transferred to decanter. The liquid fraction is recycled to  
primary equalization tank for another round of treatment and the solid fraction is send for solar 
drying and finally to Land Disposal site.

Kolhapur, Maharashtra  
 
The textile effluent generated within the plant is collectively passed through the screen chamber 
to remove the floating matter present in the wastewater. The quality and quantity of t he 
wastewater is maintained in the equilisation tank where air blower is provided for the supply of 
oxygen. The wastewater then comes to the flash mixer in which lime and ferrous sulphate are the 
coagulants added to the wastewater with detention time of 30  sec. The floc gets formed due to the 
slow mixing and resultant settling of floc in the first tube settler reduces total suspended solids 
and BOD load on the secondary treatment. The water is then allowed in the FAB -I where micro -
organisms are attached to the media, which inturn is suspended in the wastewater. The growth 
occurred on the media. The oxidation of organic matter is performed with the help of micro -
organisms. The sludge formed due to biological process gets settled in the tube settler II.  
The wa stewater treated by secondary treatment is then allowed in chlorine contact tank to kill 
pathogens using the hypochlorite as a disinfectant. The treated wastewater is then sending to the 
common effluent treatment plant for further treatment. The sludge set tled in the tube settlers is 
then sending to the sludge thickener then it is concentrated in centrifuge using poly electrolyte 
dosing. The concentrated sludge is send to the hazardous waste disposal site at Rajangoan, Pune.

11.5.3 Tamil Nadu  
The state of  Tamil Nadu follows the concept of ‘Zero Liquid Discharge’ (ZLD) especially for 
textile wastewater treatment.  
The city of Tirupur is one of the leading garment export centers in the country. Tirupur and its 
neighboring Towns houses more than 700 dyeing an d bleaching industries. Several CETPs are in 
operation in this cluster, having total handling capacity of >120 MLD and about 85 industries 
have their independent ETP and recycling system.  
The CETPs in Tirupur process the textile effluent in three stages: (1) Pre -treatment, to prepare the 
raw effluent for recycling process; (2) First stage of membrane based recycling and (3) Reject 
management from the recycling plants.  
Here, four different types of pre -treatment are used:  
(1) Biological Process based on te chnology developed by Tamil Nadu Water Investment 
Company (TWIC); (2) Chlorination; (3) Membrane Bio Reactor Technology (MBR);                      
(4) Ozonation  
 
(A) Arulpuram CETP  
Arulpuram CETP in Tirupur is based on Biological treatment technology deve loped by TWIC 
(Figure 11.8).

Distinct features of Arulpuram CETP  
 
 Pre treatment is only through biological treatment and series of specialized filters.  
 No chemical pro cess is implemented during pre -treatment, which results in generation of 
very low amount of secondary sludge.  
 Characteristic of pre -treated effluent is within the prescribed limit, except TDS  
 Pre-treated effluent is being feed to Two Stage Reverse Osmosi s plant. The R.O. treated 
effluent is recycled back in the industries for their utilization in various processes  
 The recycled treated effluents are supplied to each unit through separate pipeline. Each 
industrial unit is supplied 80 % of the raw effluent sent to CETP for treatment  
  
(B) Veerapandi CETP based on Chlorination  
The Veerapandi CEPT were initial based on conventional methods, which along the line of ZLD 
practices are upgrade, where pretreatment are now chlorination based oxidation reduction

  9911.6 Conclusion  
Upon studying the different treatment technologies adopted, few common observations can be 
made.  
(1) In the conventional treatment technology for industrial effluent treatment process alum/ferrous 
sulphate w ith lime is used, which post -treatment generates excessive sludge. Therefore sludge 
handling is additional burden on treatment cost and required another round of treatment.  
(2) ZLD practices are limited to the state of Tamil Nadu, which needs to be adopted  in other states 
across the country.   
(3) With all the practices are in force and implemented, still we rarely see decline in textile water 
pollution.  
(4) The conventional practices are needed to be upgraded on urgent basis, since at longer time 
they hav e not produce the desired results.

12.1 Opening Remarks  
The Indian wastewater management practices have been inspired by success stories of most 
established practices around the world. To understand more about how th ese countries manages 
dye, dye intermediates and textile wastewater, an overview of the current technologies prevailing 
are discussed here.    
 
12.2 China  
China is one of the global leaders in textile industries. For many years China continued with 
convent ional methods involving physico -chemical and biological process. But, China is now 
captivating multi -prolonged approach, involving public -private sectors. In recent years they have 
collaborated with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) which led their  wastewater 
management practices to reach advanced level. In IAEA assisted technology they are using 
Electron beam technology for cleaning the industrial wastewater particularly in textile industries.  
The technology involves generation of beams of electron s with the help of ‘electron beam 
accelerators’ which are irradiated into wastewaters. In the treatment process, the wastewater is 
passed through an armored chamber which is exposed to ionizing radiation (high energy electron 
beams) from the accelerators. During irradiation, the electron beams interact with complex 
compounds of wastewater, the reaction leads to the generation of comparatively simpler and 
smaller compounds. The irradiated water with less complex compounds can be further treated 
with either b iological or in combination with physico -chemical methods, before releasing into 
open water bodies.  
The initial success of this technology suggests that, the treatment does not require additional 
chemicals, is energy saver and can easily be implemented at  conventional wastewater plants. 
However, it has been claimed that, the technology that does not leave any radiation in treated 
water or make water radioactive, but further investigation may help to clear the doubts. The first 
such technology in China was initiated in the textile wastewater treatment plant at city of Jinhua, 
nearly 300 km south of Shanghai.                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 12.1 : Textile wastewater treated with irradiation tehnology  Textile waste management practices in other countires  
  103The above Figure 12.1, exemplify the success of irradiat ion technology in treatment of textile 
effluents. The first tube contains untreated textile wastewater; second tube contains irritated 
wastewater, while in third tube the dose of electron beams were higher. The result clearly shows 
that, the technology has  a potential to produce much cleaner water, which can be reuse safely.  
 
12.3 Malaysia  
Malaysia is one of the leading manufacturer and exporter of natural and synthetic textiles. It 
contributes nearly 1.3 % of synthetic textile (fibres) of the world total  production. In Malaysia, 
every textile units treats its own effluents and treated water is normally released to a drain.  
One of the wastewater treatment plant in a textile units operating since 1994, follows Standard 
Activated Sludge Process (Physical, C hemical treatment followed by Biological treatment) for 
wastewater treatment from dyeing process. They follow three stage treatment procedures. In a 
primary treatment step, raw textile wastewater is treated in coagulation and flocculation tank 
followed by neutralization and holding phage in primary settling tank (for separation of sludge). 
In a secondary (biological) stage, pre -treated effluent is given biological treatment into aeration 
tank. Post biological treatment, treated wastewater is channeled into secondary settling stage for 
sludge settlement. Retaining the part of sludge, major portion of sludge is transfer into sludge 
drying pit. After another stage of neutralization, in a tertiary stage, treated wastewater is passed  
through adsorption column pac ked with activated carbon, before final discharge of treated water.  
In another textile unit, coloured (from dyeing and printing process) and non -coloured (fabric pre -
treatment) wastewaters are treated separately. The coloured wastewater is treated in 
decolourization plant post equalization, followed by sludge dewatering and final disposal. While 
for non -coloured wastewater conventional biological treatment methods are applied as mentioned 
above. In one more treatment plant, wastewater from several textile industries are initially 
provided physico -chemcial treatment, followed by two stage aeration are provided (secondary 
biological treatment). The resultant sludge is treated (for filter press, i.e. dewatering) for final  
disposal in drain.    
 
12.4 Europe  
In Europe many large scale network projects were initiated for developing treatment stratergies at 
larger scale. Few of them are summarized below.  
 
12.4.1 Germany  
In one of the treatment plant in Germany, based on activated sludge system with low food -to-
microorganism ratio (F/M). It receives municipal wastewater and effluent from four large textile 
finishing mills. The textile wastewater is equalised and then mixed with primarily treated 
municipal waste water. The hydraulic percentage of textile wastewater  is about 45 % and 
referring to COD -load about 60 %. Subsequent to primary treatment and equalisation, there is a 
biological treatment including nitrification / denitrification and flocculation with FeCl 3 as final 
step. 
In another example, the municipal sewage is treated in primary treatment unit before mixing with 
the textile wastewater. The textile effluent is passed through bar screen to remove large waste 
material and subsequently passed through a gr it chamber to remove the smaller material. The 
water is then pumped to an equalisation tank (one standby equalisation tank) and the wastewater 
is then mixed with the primarily treated municipal wastewater and passes to the neutralisation Textile waste management practices in other countires  
  104tank. The waste is  then diluted and neutralized using H 2SO 4 or NaOH. Then the wastewater is 
treated using the activated sludge process and since it has a low F/M ratio longer retention time 
and aeration is required. The water is then passed to the secondary clarifiers after  which FeCl 3 is 
added to destabilize the colloidal materials and cause the small particles to agglomerate into 
larger settleable flocs, thus aiding the coagulation and flocculation process. The treated effluent is 
then directly discharged to the river.  
 
12.4.2 FOTOTEX project  
The project demonstrated the effectiveness of photo -oxidation treatment process for removal of 
biodegradable and non -biodegradable organic compounds from textile effluents. Though the 
photo -oxidation technique removes organic compounds , it did not decrease the salinity and fails 
to achieve quality parameters for reuse of water in the production process of textile units. The 
project concludes that, single treatment system is not effective and requires combination of 
membrane system like microfilteration and nanofilteration.    
 
12.4.3 PROWATER project  
In PROWATER project effluent recycling system was based on physico -chemical pre -treatment 
(coagulation + lamellar sedimentation/flotation), cross -flow ultrafiltration and ozonation. The 
process made claim for water reuse from technical and economic perception. Four proto -types of 
treatment technologies were developed during the project for four different textile wet industries 
and had tested various kinds of effluents. The project claims to r educe the colour of effluent by      
98 % and total surfactants by 62 %. The additional claim was for the cost of purification and 
reuse of water, which was cost effective compared to commercial purification process.    
  
12.4.4 ADOPBIO project  
The project  employed Advanced Oxidation Process (UV -activated photolysis of hydrogen 
peroxide and thermal activated oxidation process) in conjugation with bio -flotation process for 
decolourization and recyclying treatment of textile finishing effluent. The process ac hieved 
complete decolourization of coloured effluent, while bio -flotation aids in degradation of residual 
organic compounds.    
 
12.4.5 BATTLE project  
The BATTLE project essentially used and evaluated the applicability of BATs for SEMs of 
textile finishing  sector. Before implementing the project, study was performed to collect primary 
information of effluents and availability of process. It based on separation of wastewater into 
those that have potential reuse properties and that cannot be reuse. For reusab le water, membrane 
based technology was used followed by biological treatment. Wastewaters are segregated, 
collected separately and pumped into a mixing tank and send for an ultrafiltration. For reuse of 
treated water, membrane permeates are mixed with pri mary water and send to water distribution 
networks. Water which cannot be reuse further are mixed with membrane concentrated and were 
treated in existing biological treatment plant. The project concludes that developed technology is 
highly replicable and p rovides a model for other textile industries.

  10512.4.6 PURIFAST project  
This project used Advanced Oxidation Process (AOPs) and ultrafiltration to demonstrate the 
technical as well as economic feasibilities for treatment of textile and mixed effluent. T he lab 
scale method showed the efficiency of ultrasound in combination of ultrafilteration. While at pre -
industrial scale ultrasound were replaced with AOPs. The project concludes that, treatment with 
ultrafilteration allows complete removal of total suspe nded solids and turbidity and ozonation 
removes colour. While combination of ozonation and ultrafilteration at pre -industrial scale 
achieves 90 % colour removal, 80 % COD reduction and nearly 80 % TSS removal.

The preliminarily analysis of these patents revealed that technologies for textile wastewater 
treatment were based on chemi cal, physico -chemical, biological methods, including integrated 
processes (biological -physico -chemical). It further indicated that, technologies based on 
biological methods are more preferred (Figure 13.1), than chemical or physico -chemical methods.

Figure 13.1 : Broad classification of treatment technologies developed for dye and textile 
industrial effluent   
 
The technologies based on biological methods can be further classified into following:  
(1) Use of single microbial cult ures ( viz. Bacteria, Fungus, Algae)  
(2) Use of microbial consortium  
(3) Use of novel apparatus or devise involving microorganisms  
(4) Use of novel composition   
 
(1) Use of Single Microbial cultures  
Conventionally, the most common biological method to de colorize and degrade the dye 
containing and textile effluent is use of single pure microbial cultures favorably (due to number of  
advantages) different species of bacteria and fungi. More than half of the patents studied made of 
use of either Pseudomonas  spp., Bacillus spp., Kocuria  sp. (bacteria), Flavodon  sp. (fungi) or 
Scenedesmus  sp. (algae). The approach describes isolation, screening and use of most effective 
microbial strains for treatment of simulated/raw dye and/or textile effluents under laborator y/in 
situ conditions. To discuss couple of patents under this category, Raghu et al., (2011) in their 
patent “Processes for decolorization of colored effluents” describes the use of a unidentified 
fungus ‘NIOCC #2a’, isolated from a mangrove wood, for deco lourization of effluents from 
textile and dye manufacturing industries, molasses spent wash from alcohol distilleries and paper 
and pulp industries. The decolourization process was carried at 30 to 60ºC and at pH 3 to 6, 
having a salinity of 25 ppt, using either free mycelia or immobilized fungus or extracellular 
culture fluids or extracellular polymeric substances.  
In another patent Sarabjeet Singh Ahluwalia (2016) have reported the use of bacterial strain 
Kocuria rosea  capable of decolourizing and degrad ing simulated and raw effluent released from Patent Analysis  
  113dye, textile and paper -pulp industries with a efficiency of removing 53 -99 % colour from 
wastewater.       
 
(2) Use of microbial consortium/mixed cultures  
Although microbial consortia/mixed cultures are used wi dely in many laboratories across the 
country for dye and textile wastewater remediation, exceedingly few of them have approach for 
patenting. In one of the rare examples, patent obtained by S. Sandhya (2011) of CSIR 
laboratories, has reported using of bact erial consortia consisting of Pseudomonas aeruginosa , 
Alcaligenes sp. and Bacillus latrosphorous  for bioremediation of dye and textile wastewater 
under microaerophili -aerobic consortium.    
 
(3) Use of novel apparatus or devise involving microorganisms  
Under this category, patent granted in the year 2016 to Sivasankar et al., on “Novel method for 
removal of organic and inorganic contaminants caused by textile dye effluents in the agricultural 
soil by bio -electrokinetics” describes the use of three distinct  species of Bacillus  and a 
Pseudomonas sp. which is based on electrokinetic appraoch. This bio -electrokinetic process used 
starch along with bacterial strains as anolyte, which moves towards cathode via electro -osmosis 
process, resulting in reduction of CO D in the range of 70 -80 %. The inorganic contaminants (like 
chloride, sulphate and trace metals) from the effluent during the treatment were removed 
(recovered) through electro -migration process. The patent claims to improve the fertility of 
agricultural s oils after this treatment.     
 
(4) Use of novel composition  
The fourth type of technology describes the preparation of novel composition including algal 
stain for treatment of water containing azo dye Direct Red 31 (DR31). Subhashsa Nigam (2017) 
from Amit y University, in the patent “Algal -Go Nanocomposites for the Reduction of Textile 
Dyes” mentions the preparation of nano -composite consisting of cells of Scenedesmus  sp. and 
graphene oxide nano sheets for reduction of DR31. The lyophilized Scenedesmus  sp. and 
graphene oxide were mixed at optimum ratio in deionized water (with constant stirring for 12 h 
under ambient conditions) and the resultant mixture was again lyophilized to treat dye containing 
wastewater by photocatalytic activity.    
 
13.3 National St atus of Patents  
Amongst the different research institutes and universities, Council for Scientific and Industrial 
Research (CSIR), New Delhi is leading in obtaining patents for developing technology for 
treatment of dye and textile effluents. As observed f rom Figure 13.2, half of the patents (51 %) 
came from CSIR labs. Two patents were awarded to Amity University, while one patent from 
University of Rajasthan, Rajasthan were supported by Department of Biotechnology (DBT) New 
Delhi. Three patents were filed by three different individuals that can be categorized as 
Private/Individual patents.       Patent Analysis

13.4 International Status of Patents  
Globally, China leads with 171 patents (i.e. 64 %) (among st the patent considered in this study), 
followed by USA (13 %), India (9 %), Korea (4 %) for developing technologies for treatment of 
dye and textile effluents (Figure 13.3). The other countries include DE (3 %), Japan (3 %),               
EP (2 %).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 13.3:  Distribution of patents for development of novel technologies in dye and textile

  115As noted above, the international patents for textile wastewater management practice also can 
broadly classified i nto physical, chemical, physico -chemical, biological methods, including 
integrated processes (biological -physico -chemical). The partial list of patetns obtained by 
scientists of top ranking conutires is described in Appendix.           
 
13.5 Conclusion  
From the above study, it can be suggested that, though few patents were gratned, commerlization 
of patents are missing in India. Also India lags behind to top ranking countires in obtaining 
patents in the area of bioremediation. More research activites in thi s direction along with more 
finincal investment is necessary. We need patents which can be adopted by the ETPs, CETPs or 
textile mills directly.

14.1.1 Decolorization of textile dyes using Aspergillus ochraceus  
 
(A) Results, summary and major outcomes  
The present study dealt with the decolorizat ion and degradation of textile dye Reactive blue 25 
(0.1 gL-1) by mycelium of Aspergillus ochraceus  NCIM -1146. Spectrophotometric and visual 
examinations showed that the decolorization was through fungal adsorption, followed by 
degradation. Shaking conditi on was found to be better for complete and faster adsorption (7 h) 
and decolorization (20 d) of dye Reactive blue 25 (100 mgL-1) as compared to static condition. 
Presence of glucose in medium showed faster adsorption (4 h) and decolorization of dye from 
bound (7 d) mycelium. FTIR and GCMS analysis study revealed biodegradation of Reactive blue 
25 into two metabolites phthalimide and di -isobutyl phthalate.  
Aspergillus ochraceus (NCIM -1146) has ability to decolorize various textile dyes viz. Purple 2R, 
Orange  TG22, Yellow HE64, Red HERB and Golden yellow HER was determined by monitoring 
the decrease in absorbance of each dye in the culture supernantant. Decolorization performance of 
Purple 2R with various conditions such as different media, concentration of dy e, agitation and 
static condtions were studied. The decrease in dye decolorization capability of mycelium was 
observed with increasing dye concentration in repeated batch mode. Spectrophotometric data 
revealed that the process involved in decolorization is  through microbial metabolism but not 
biosorption. Phytotoxicity study demonstrated no toxicity of the biodegradated products for plants 
with respect to Phaseoulus mungo  and Sorghum vulgare . 
Aspergillus ochraceus (NCIM -1146) has ability to decolorize vario us xenobiotic dyes. 
Biodegradation of dyes was demonstrated by their decolorisation in the culture medium. The 
extent of biodegradation was determined by monitoring the decrease in absorbance of each dye. 
Malachite green decolorisation activity is affected  by various conditions such as composition of 
media, concentration of dye, amount of mycelia and agitation. The durability of decolorisation 
activity under optimum conditions was investigated in repeated batch mode. An increase in the 
amount of mycelia pos itively affected the durability of decolorisation activity. The decrease in 
dye decolorisation capability of mycelia occurred with increasing dye concentration in repeated 
batch mode. This organism showed significant ability to decolorize all the dyes test ed viz. 
malachite green (98 %), cotton blue (92 %), methyl violet (61 %) and crystal violet (57 %) in 24 h 
incubation. Spectrophotometric data revealed that the process involved in decolorisation is 
through microbial metabolism but not biosorption. This st udy showed that fungal mycelia               
(A. ochraceus) could effectively be used as an alternative to the traditional physico -chemical 
process.  
 
(B) Major highlights of the work done  
Aspergillus ochraceus  NCIM -1146 was found to decolorize textile dye  Reactive blue -25, Purple 
2R, Malachite green, Cotton blue, Methyl violet and Crystal violet. This study suggests that this 
strain could be a useful tool for textile effluent treatment and the alternative to the traditional 
physicochemical process.  
 
 Work of some Indian researchers  
  11914.1. 2 Biodegradation of textile dyes (Golden yellow HE2R & Navy Blue 3G using 
Brevibacillus laterosporus  
 
(A) Results, summary and major outcomes  
Growth of B. laterosporus : The exponential phase of B. laterosporus  started after 12 h of 
incubation and continued  up to 72 h at 30°C. The status of the biotransformation enzymes was 
found to be optimum at 36 h of incubation which was the mid exponential phase. These results 
probed the use of Brevibacillus  culture at its mid exponential phase for dye decolorization st udies.  
Decolorization of dyes using B. laterosporus  and the effect of physico -chemical parameters:  GY-
HE2R and NB -3G showed 87 % and 80 % decolorization respectively, within 48 h under static 
condition at 50 mgL-1 concentration. However, no significant ch ange in the decolorization 
potential was observed under shaking conditions. Decolorization performance of all the dyes GY -
HE2R and NB -3G was decreased with an increase in the initial dye concentrations from 0.1 to 1.0 
gL-1. B. laterosporus  steeply decrease d the decolorization of Golden Yellow -HE2R and Navy 
Blue -3G at the concentration 1.0 gL-1 with poor performance even after extended incubation           
(46 and 66 %, respectively within 72 h).  
In case of Navy Blue -3G, better performance of decolorization was observed in the quite broad 
range of pH 7.0 to 11.0; however decolorization of Golden Yellow -HE2R was found in the 
broader range (pH 5.0 to 9.0). In present study, B. laterosporus  exhibited maximum 
decolorization at 30°C whereas in case of Golden Yello w-HE2R and Navy Blue -3G, more than 
60 % of the dye was removed even at 15°C, after an extended incubation period.  Studies show 
that B. laterosporus  has better decolorization activity of the two studied dyes during its 
exponential growth phase. The organis m showed more efficient decolorization in 24 -96 h old 
cultures. When 40 mgL-1 wet weight of the culture was used, the time required for complete 
decolorization of GY -HE2R and NB -3G was reduced to 18 h and 12 h respectively. Moreover, 
nitrogen sources  were found to be stimulatory for the decolorization activity as compared to the 
studied carbon and phosphorus sources. KH 2PO 4 and NaH 2PO 4 were found to have no significant 
effect on the decolorization of GY -HE2R and NB -3G. Among the carbon sources studied, star ch 
was better source whereas in presence of glucose, the cells have shown poor decolorization in all 
the cases. Complete decolorization of dyes occurred simply in the synthetic medium (without any 
supplementary components) when provided with an extended in cubation.  
The organism retained good dye decolorization abilities even when used in repeated cycles. The 
growth of B. laterosporus  was remarkably increased during the decolorization of GY -HER and 
NB-3G (45 and 56 % respectively) after 24 h of incubation; whereas it decreased (18 %) during 
the decolorization of GY -HER after the further incubation up to 72 h.  
Decrease in the activity of tyrosinase (31 %), no significant change in the activity of laccase 
whereas significant increase in the activities of LiP ( 156 %), aminopyrine N -demethylase                 
(120 %), DCIP reductase (76 %) and MG reductase (40 %) was found in the cell free extract 
obtained after 48 h of incubation during the decolorization of Golden Yellow -HER by                        
B. latero sporus . Complete inhibition of tyrosinase, no significant change in the activities of 
laccase and DCIP reductase where as significant increase in the activities of LiP (54 %), 
aminopyrine N -demethylase (122 %), and MG reductase (50 %) was found in the cell  free extract 
obtained after 48 h of incubation during the decolorization of Navy Blue -3G by B. laterosporus . 
In addition, no significant change during the decolorization of GY -HER, significant decrease             
(8 %) during the decolorization of NB -3G where as significant increase (~10 %) during the Work of some Indian researchers  
  120decolorization of MG and MR was observed in the activity of LiP in to the culture supernatant 
(i.e. extracellular). No activities of laccase, tyrosinase as well as DCIP reductase, MG reductase 
and aminopyrin e N-demethylase were found in to the culture supernatant. The findings of 
microbial and phytotoxicity studies suggest that B. laterosporus  produces nontoxic metabolites 
with respect to the tested microorganisms and plants.  
Decolorization of textile effluent : 100 ml batch culture of the organism decolorized 35 % of 
textile effluent within 24 h.  Approximately 5 g (wet wt) of the immobilized beads kept in 250 ml 
effluent under static condition (in 500 ml beaker) decolorized about 60 % of the effluent within 
24 h and retained 50 % decolorization efficiency upto 5 cycles.  
Purification of intracellular lignin peroxidase: A total amount of about 280 mg of protein, 
corresponding to approximately 86 units of lignin peroxidase was loaded onto the column. This 
ion excha nge column chromatography allowed the recovery of 35.55 units in 1.98 mg of protein 
with a yield of 40 % and purification factor of approximately 57 fold. Although homogeneity was 
obtained and confirmed by PAGE, elution of enzyme from fraction number 39 to  69 (i.e. broad 
range) suggested the presence of multiple binding sites with different ionizable groups. In the 
present study, PAGE gel developed by Coomassie brilliant blue staining has shown single band 
for a protein having molecular weight about 205 kDa  where the molecular weight of an enzyme 
was estimated using MW -standard markers. Moreover, PAGE gel developed by the activity 
staining using L -DOPA has shown only one band at the same run as that of developed by 
Coomassie brilliant blue staining. The enzy me was active throughout a broad range of 
temperature, its optimum temperature being 40oC while its optimum pH was found to be 4.5. 
Maximum activity of the enzyme was observed with 750 mM concentration of tartaric acid. 
Lignin peroxidase from the B. latero sporus  was found to be dependent on H 2O2 since no activity 
exhibited in the absence H 2O2. Continuous increase in lignin peroxidase activity with the 
increasing concentration of H 2O2 from a range 10 mM to 1 M was observed. The Km value of the 
enzyme was fou nd to be 1.6 mM.  
 
(B) Major highlights of the work done  
The present work explores the dye degrading abilities of B. laterosporus , with studies of the basic 
underlying mechanisms behind the removal of the dyes, GY -HE2R, NB -3G and textile effluents. 
The intr acellular enzymes as well as whole cell systems can be used as effective bioremediating 
tools for the removal of textile dyes.  
 
14.1.3 Biodegradation of textile dyes (Scarlet RR, Rubine GFL, Brown 3REL, Methyl Red, 
Brilliant Blue, Golden Yellow HER and Rem azol Red) using Galactomyces  
geotrichum MTCC 1360 and consortia with Brevibacillus laterosporus  
 
(A) Results, summary and major outcomes  
The G. geotrichum  showed 86 % of decolorization of Golden Yellow HER within 30 h, at 30 °C 
and pH 7.0 under microaeroph ilic (static) condition with significant reduction in COD (73 %) and 
TOC (62 %), respectively. This organism tolerates 500 mgL-1 of dye concentration. The 
degradation efficiency of this strain using carbon and nitrogen sources viz. wheat bran and 
glucose s howed fast decolorization individually as well as glucose in combination with 
ammonium chloride and yeast extract responsible for faster decolorization of Golden Yellow Work of some Indian researchers  
  121HER. Enzymatic studies indicate the involvement of azo reductase, laccase and NADH -DCIP  
reductase enzymes in biotransformation. Azo dyes can be cleaved symmetrically or 
asymmetrically depending on the structure of substrate. The products of degradation were 
identified as 4(5 -hydroxy, 4 -amino cyclopentane) sulfobenzene and 4(5 -hydroxy cyclope ntane) 
sulfobenzene by GC -MS. In addition, when G. geotrichum  was applied to decolorize textile 
effluent, it showed 85% of true color removal (ADMI removal) within 72 h, along with a 
significant reduction in TOC (42 %) and COD (58 %) under microaerophilic condition. 
Phytotoxicity study revealed less toxic nature of the formed metabolites as compared to parent 
dye with respect to S. vulgare  and P. mungo . 
Malt extract medium was found to be most suitable for the degradation of Remazol Red among 
the other used  media. The G. geotrichum  showed 96 % decolorization of Remazol Red (50 mgL-
1) for 36 h, at 30 °C and pH 11.0 under microaerophilic condition along with significant reduction 
in COD (62 %) and TOC (41 %). Peptone (5.0 gL-1), rice husk (10 gL-1 extract) and ammonium 
chloride (5.0 gL-1) were found to be more significant among the carbon and nitrogen sources 
used. The presence of tyrosinase, NADH -DCIP reductase, riboflavin reductase and induction in 
azo reductase and laccase activity during decolorization indic ated their role in degradation. The 
metabolites produced after degradation was analyzed by HPTLC, FTIR, HPLC and GC -MS. The 
asymmetric cleavage of azo dye Remazol Red was carried out by azo reductase into reactive 
intermediate and subsequently mineralized by other enzyme found in G. geotrichum . 
Phytotoxicity study indicated the conversion of complex dye molecules into simpler oxidizable 
products having less toxic nature.  
The degradation of disperse azo dye and its toxicological approach in the sense of Allium cepa .     
G. geotrichum  MTCC 1360 showed 87 % decolorization of Rubine GFL (50 mgL-1) within 96 h 
at 30 °C and pH 7.0 under microaerophilic condition with significant reduction of COD (67 %) 
and TOC (59 %). The natural carbon and nitrogen sources like ri ce husk, wood shaving and 
bagasse was found to efficient for the decolorization of dye along with other sources used. 
Examination of oxidoreductive enzymes viz. laccase, tyrosinase and azo reductase confirmed 
their role in decolorization and degradation of  Rubine GFL. Biodegradation of Rubine GFL into 
different metabolites was confirmed using HPTLC, HPLC, FTIR and GC -MS analysis. During 
toxicological studies, cell death was observed in Rubine GFL treated Allium cepa  root cells. 
Toxicological studies before and after microbial treatment was studied with respect to 
cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, oxidative stress, antioxidant enzyme status, protein oxidation and lipid  
peroxidation analysis using root cells of Allium cepa . The antioxidant enzymes SOD and GPX 
were f ound to have the dose dependent induction, whereas CAT showed dose dependent 
inhibition. Similarly, lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation rates were also increased indicating  
the toxic nature of dye and effluent on A. cepa  cells. Toxicity analysis with Allium cepa  signifies 
that dye exerts oxidative stress and subsequently toxic effect on the root cells whereas formed 
metabolites relatively less toxic in nature. Phytotoxicity study reveals the less toxic nature of 
formed metabolite as compared to control  dye Rubine GFL. The successful degradation of Brown 
3 REL, Scarlet RR, Methyl Red and Brilliant Blue G was carried out by G. geotrichum . 
The preferential degradation of azo and non azo dye carried out in mixture. Decolorization 
affected by the chemical st ructure and surface function group near to azo bond. So we have 
studied time dependant degradation of textile dyes by G. geotrichum . In this study proved that the 
chemical structure affected the decolorization phenomenon. The G. geotrichum  MTCC 1360, a 
yeast species showed 88 % ADMI (American dye manufacturing institute) removal of mixture of 
structurally different dyes (Remazol red, Golden yellow HER, Rubine GFL, Scarlet RR, Methyl Work of some Indian researchers  
  122red, Brown 3 REL, Brilliant blue) (70 mgL-1) within 24 h at 30 °C and pH 7.0  under shaking 
condition (120 rpm). Glucose (0.5 %) as a carbon source was found to be more effective than 
other sources used. The medium with metal salt (CaCl 2, ZnSO 4, FeCl 3, MgCl 2, CuSO 4) (0.5 mM) 
showed less ADMI removal as compared to control, but did not inhibit complete decolorization. 
The presence of tyrosinase, NADH -DCIP reductase and induction in laccase activity during 
decolorization indicated their role in degradation. HPTLC (High performance thin layer 
chromatography) analysis revealed the remov al of individual dyes at different time intervals from 
dye mixture, indicating preferential degradation of dyes. FTIR and HPLC analysis of samples 
before and after decolorization confirmed the biotransformation of dye. The reduction of COD 
(69 %), TOC (43 %), and phytotoxicity study indicated the conversion of complex dye molecules 
into simpler oxidizable products having less toxic nature.  
The comparative study of decolorization of two different azo dyes Remazol red and Rubine GFL 
disclosed the diverse cata lytic activities of B. laterosporus . It decolorized 100 % of Remazol red 
and 95 % of Rubine GFL within 30 and 48 h, respectively under static condition at 50 mgL-1 dye 
concentration. Significant increase was observed in azo reductase, NADH -DCIP reductase, 
veratryl alcohol oxidase and tyrosinase in cells obtained after decolorization of Remazol red; 
whereas these values were much different with complete inhibition of azo reductase during 
decolorization of Rubine GFL. The plausible pathway of dyes obtained fr om Gas 
chromatography -Mass spectroscopy (GC -MS) data confirmed the different metabolic fate of these 
structurally unidentical dyes. HPLC, FTIR and HPTLC analysis of extracted metabolites 
confirmed the biodegradation, while phytotoxicity study assured the d etoxification of both the 
dyes studied. The results obtained in this study suggests, i) sulpho and hydroxyl group present at 
ortho position to azo group stimulated reduction of azo bond by azo reductase in Remazol red, ii) 
the same reduction was totally ha mpered due to presence of ethyl -amino propanenitrile group at 
para position to azo group in Rubine GFL. B. laterosporus can degrade the sulphonated azo dyes 
having naphthol ring much faster; supporting that the sulpho and hydroxyl group present at ortho 
position to azo group stimulated the reduction of azo bond by azo reductase. The functional 
groups present in the nearby vicinity of azo bond play a central role in azo bond reduction.  
B. laterosporus  decolorized 96 % of Brown 3 REL within 48 h at pH 7, 40 °C in static condition at 
50 mgL-1 concentration. Presence of peptone and yeast extract showed increased decolorization 
efficiency of B. laterosporus , whereas glucose and starch totally inhibited the decolorization 
ability. Enzymatic studies indicate the inv olvement of Veratryl alcohol oxidase and NADH -DCIP 
reductase enzymes in the biotransformation at these sets of conditions. Biodegradation products 
of Brown 3 REL were N -carbamoyl -2-[(8-chloroquinazolin -4-yl)oxy] acetamide and N -
carbamoyl -2-(quinazolin -4-yloxy)acetamide when identified by Gas Chromatography -Mass 
spectroscopy. These metabolites found to be much less toxic than Brown 3 REL in phytotoxicity 
study. In addition to the single dye decolorization, B. laterosporus  strain proved its applicability 
into the effluent treatment plant as it decolorized textile industry effluent with effective reduction 
in COD and TOC. Same strain used further for biodegradation study of disperse dye Scarlet RR 
in which, 100 % decolorization of same was obtained within 48 h with pH and temperature 
optima of pH 7 and 40 °C, respectively. From the studied carbon and nitrogen sources, 
decolorization efficiency was observed better in yeast extract and peptone while carbon sources 
have shown reduced decolorization of Scarlet RR. At  the enzyme level, induction in activities of 
veratryl alcohol oxidase, tyrosinase, NADH -DCIP reductase and riboflavin reductase was 
recorded. The biodegradation of Scarlet RR into different metabolites was confirmed by the 
HPLC, FTIR and HPTLC. A possible  fate of metabolism of Scarlet dye was determined using Work of some Indian researchers  
  123GC-MS. It revealed the proposed biodegradation pathway of Scarlet RR into final product, N -
(1λ3-chlorinin -2-yl) acetamide. Phytotoxicity study revealed completely nontoxic nature of 
degraded metabolit es to Sorghum vulgare and Phaseolus mongo plants as compared to toxic 
Scarlet RR. In addition,              B. laterosporus  can degrade the dye with high concentrations of 
it and can also be used repeatedly for at least five cycles.  
The biodegradation of a  mixture containing seven commercial textile dyes with different 
structures and color properties has been investigated by B. laterosporus . It showed 87 % 
decolorization in terms of ADMI removal (American dye manufacturing institute) within 24 h. 
The effect ive decolorization of dye mixture was attained in the presence of metal salt -CaCl 2 and 
nitrogen sources. The activity of oxidative enzymes in cellular organization amplifies during the 
stress of structurally different dyes. High performance thin layer chro matography exposed the 
mechanism of preferential biodegradation of dyes at different time periods. Significant change in 
the High pressure liquid chromatography and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of sample 
before and after treatment confirmed the biodegradation of dye mixture. Phytotoxicity study 
revealed the much less toxic nature of the metabolites produced after the degradation of dyes 
mixture. B. laterosporus  can progressively degrade the dye within short span when combined 
with other dyes in c ulture; otherwise it needed long time to degrade the same dye when it 
concerned about single dye decolorization. B. laterosporus  have broad specificity as it can 
degrade structurally diverse range of dyes with significant reduction in its toxicity and have  
preference in metabolism.  
The decolorization ability of a bacterial -yeast consortium was also tested with two real textile 
effluent having different characteristics and a simulated synthetic effluent made up of five 
different synthetic textile dyes. Conso rtium decolorized real effluent -1 and 2 with 89 and 60 % 
decolorization efficiency respectively within 48 h. In case of simulated synthetic effluent, 69 % 
decolorization with significant reduction in BOD and COD by consortium, 42 and 16 % 
decolorization by  G. geotrichum  and B. laterosporus,  respectively were detected. In all the set of 
experiments, decolorizing ability of consortium is much more superior to the decolorizing 
capability of individual microorganisms. Cumulative action of oxidoreductive enzyme in 
consortium was found to be responsible for faster decolorization by the same. Fourier Transform 
Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis suggested effective biotransformation of dyes present in 
the simulated synthetic effluent by consortium as compared to individual strains. The core finding 
of this study is the monitoring of release of each dye present in the simulated synthetic effluent 
using High Performance Thin Layer Chromatography (HPTLC). As monitored by HPTLC, 
consortium biodegraded all the dyes exc ept Malachite green within 1 h only. In contrast,                
G. geotrichum  required 4 h to remove the dyes; while up to 16 h of B. laterosporus  treatment, no 
significant change in HPTLC chromatogram was detected. This study dealt with the proficiency 
of consortium over individual microorganisms along with the detailed monitoring of gradual 
biodegradation of each dye from the simulated synthetic effluent. The decolorization efficiency of 
microbial treatment to real effluent 1 was in the order as, consort ium > B. laterosporus  >                     
G. geotrichum ; however this order was changed to consortium > G. geotrichum  > B. laterosporus 
in case of decolorization of real effluent 2 and simulated synthetic effluent. This suggests that th e 
decolorization e fficiency of each microbial species varies with the type of pollutant to be reduced. 
BOD/COD ratio of real textile effluent 1 and 2 was increased to 0.35 and 0.32, respectively after 
consortium treatment converting the high strength effluent into easily bi odegradable element 
which confirms the effectiveness of consortium. HPTLC analysis helped in monitoring of rapid 
and gradual release of each dye chromophore from the effluent.  Work of some Indian researchers  
  124(B) Major highlights of the work done  
These ecofriendly methods should be used f or further applications in large scale studies. But scale 
up of these parameters should be taken into consideration. Hence for application part of these 
studies, we studied the decolorization of various dyes and textile industry effluent using 
immobilized cells of consortium BL -GG. We extended this study be developing two different 
type of bioreactors i.e. Up flow fixed bed reactor (UFFBR) and Triple layered packed bed reactor 
(TLPBR) using immobilized cells and used for continuous decolorization of textile  industry 
effluent along with its repeated use. Up flow fixed bed reactor (UFFBR) and Triple layered 
packed bed reactor (TLPBR) showed an average of 93 and 86 % efficiency respectively in seven 
days run at flow rate of 10 and 100 mlh-1. We could use these bioreactors for repeated use after 
regeneration of same with nutrient feeding. These studies showed the efficiency and repeated use 
of immobilized cells on applied level.  
 
14.1.4 Studies on microbial decolorization and degradation of toxic dyes from textil e 
effluent  
 
(A) Results, summary and major outcomes  
A novel bacterium was isolated from the soil of Ichalkaranji textile industrial area. Through          
16S rRNA sequence matching and morphological observation it was identified as Lysinibacillus  
sp. RGS.  This strain has ability to decolorize various industrial dyes among which, it showed 
complete decolorization and degradation of toxic sulfonated azo dye C.I. Remazol Red (at 30 °C, 
pH 7.0, under static condition) with higher chemical oxygen demand (COD) re duction (92 %) 
within 6 h of incubation. Various parameters like agitation, pH, temperature and initial dye 
concentrations were optimized to develop faster decolorization process. The supplementation of 
cheap co -substrates (e.g., extracts of agricultural w astes) could enhance the decolorization 
performance of Lysinibacillus  sp. RGS. Induction in oxidoreductive enzymes presumably 
indicates involvement of these enzymes in the decolorization/degradation process. Analytical 
studies of the extracted metabolites confirmed the significant degradation of Remazol Red into 
various metabolites. The phytotoxicity assay (with respect to plants Phaseolus mungo  and 
Sorghum vulgare ) revealed that the degradation of Remazol Red produced nontoxic metabolites. 
Finally Lysiniba cillus  sp. RGS was applied to decolorize mixture of dyes and actual industrial 
effluent showing 87 % and 72 % decolorization (in terms of decrease in ADMI value) with 69 % 
and 62 % COD reduction within 48 h and 96 h, respectively.  
Lysinibacillus sp. RGS d egrades sulfonated azo dye Reactive Orange 16 (RO16) efficiently. 
Superoxide dismutase and catalase activity were tested to study the response of Lysinibacillus  sp. 
RGS to the oxidative stress generated by RO16. The results demonstrated that oxidative stre ss 
enzymes not only protect the cell from oxidative stress but also has a probable role in 
decolorization along with an involvement of oxidoreductive enzymes. Formation of three 
different metabolites after degradation of RO16 has been confirmed by GCMS ana lysis. FTIR 
analysis verified the degradation of functional groups of RO16, and HPTLC confirmed the 
removal of auxochrome group from the RO16 after degradation. Toxicity studies confirmed the 
genotoxic, cytotoxic, and phytotoxic nature of RO16 and the form ation of less toxic products after 
the treatment of Lysinibacillus  sp. RGS.  
Lysinibacillus  sp. RGS, an effective dye degrading bacteria immobilized on Luffa cylindrica  
(Loofa) was used to decolorize sulphonated azo dye Blue HERD and 50 % real textile effl uent in Work of some Indian researchers  
  125an upflow column bioreactor. Blue HERD (200 mgL-1) and 50 % real textile effluent were 
degraded at volumetric flow rate 40 mLh-1 and 15 mLh-1, respectively. Induction in reductive 
(NADH -DCIP reductase and azoreductase) as well as oxidative (laccase , tyrosinase and veratryl 
alcohol oxidase) enzymes proved enzymatic decolorization of Blue HERD and 50 % textile 
effluent. Significant reduction in COD, BOD, TOC, hardness and alkalinity of decolorized 
samples of Blue HERD and 50 % effluent confirmed miner alization. HPTLC, FTIR and GCMS 
analysis confirmed degradation of Blue HERD into simple intermediates during decolorization in 
bioreactor. Less toxic nature of metabolites was confirmed using genotoxicity, cytotoxicity and 
phytotoxicity tests.  
Complete dec olorization and detoxification of Reactive Orange 4 within 5 h (pH 6.6, at 30 °C) by 
isolated Lysinibacillus  sp. RGS was observed. Significant reduction in TOC (93 %) and COD (90 
%) was indicative of conversion of complex dye into simple products, which wer e identified as 
naphthalene moieties by various analytical techniques (HPLC, FTIR, and GCMS). 
Supplementation of agricultural waste extract considered as better option to make the process cost 
effective. Oxido -reductive enzymes were found to be involved in  the degradation mechanism. 
Finally, Loofa  immobilized Lysinibacillus  sp. cells in a fixed -bed bioreactor showed significant 
decolorization with reduction in TOC (51 and 64 %) and COD (54 and 66 %) for synthetic and 
textile effluent at 30 and 35 mLh-1 feeding rate, respectively. The degraded metabolites showed 
non-toxic nature revealed by phytotoxicity and photosynthetic pigments content study for 
Sorghum vulgare  and Phaseolus mungo . In addition nitrogen fixing and phosphate solubilizing 
microbes were less affected in treated wastewater and thus the treated effluent can be used for the 
irrigation purpose.  
 
(B) Major highlights of the work done  
a) Lysinibacillus  sp. RGS has a better perspective of bioremediation for textile dyes viz. Remazol 
Red, Reactive Orange , 16 Blue HERD and Reactive Orange 4.  
b) Loofa  immobilized Lysinibacillus  sp. cells in a fixed -bed bioreactor showed significant 
decolorization with reduction in TOC of synthetic and textile effluent.  
c) These results increase the applicability of the strain for  the treatment of industrial wastewaters 
containing dye pollutants.  
d) This work could be useful for the development of efficient and ecofriendly technologies to 
reduce dye content in the wastewater to permissible levels at affordable cost.  
 
 
14.1.5 Construct ion of wetland - a phytoremediation treatment process for the degradation 
of dyes from textile industrial effluent  
 
(A) Results, summary and major outcomes  
Salvinia molesta , an aquatic fern was observed to have a potential of degrading azo dye Rubine 
GFL up  to 97 % at a concentration of 100 mgL-1 within 72 h using 6072 g of root biomass. Both 
root as well as stem tissues showed induction in activities of the enzymes such as lignin 
peroxidase, veratryl alcohol oxidase, laccase, tyrosinase, catalase, DCIP redu ctase and superoxide 
dismutase during decolorization of Rubine GFL. FTIR, GC -MS, HPLC and UV –visible 
spectrophotometric analysis confirmed phytotransformation of the model dye into smaller 
molecules. Analysis of metabolites revealed breakdown of an azo bon d of Rubine GFL by the 
action of lignin peroxidise and laccase and formation of 2 -methyl -4-nitroaniline and N -Work of some Indian researchers  
  126methylbenzene -1,4-diamine. Anatomical tracing of dye in the stem of S. molesta  confirmed the 
presence of dye in tissues and sub sequent removal af ter 48 h of treatment. The concentration of 
chlorophyll pigments like chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotenoid was observed during the 
treatment. Toxicity analysis on seeds of Triticum aestivum  and Phaseolus mungo  revealed the 
decreased toxicity of dye metabolites. In situ  treatment of a real textile effluent was further 
monitored in a constructed lagoon of the dimensions of 7 m x 5 m x 2 m (total surface are a              
35 m2) using S. molesta  for 192 h.This large scale treatment was found to signifi cantly reduce the 
values of COD, BOD 5 and ADMI by 76, 82 and 81 % considering initial values 1185, 1440 mgL-1 
and 950 Units, respectively.  
Alternanthera philoxeroides  Griseb. a macrophyte was found to degrade a highly sulfonated 
textile dye Remazol Red (RR ) completely within 72 h at a concentration of 70 mgL-1. An 
induction in the activities of azoreductase and riboflavin reductase was observed in root and stem 
tissues; while the activities of lignin peroxidase, laccase and DCIP reductase were induced in le af 
tissues. Some enzymes namely tyrosinase, veratryl alcohol oxidase, catalase and superoxide 
dismutase displayed an increase in their activity in all the tissues in response of 72 h exposure to  
Remazol Red. There was a marginal reduction in contents of ch lorophyll a (20 %), chlorophyll b 
(5 %) and carotenoids (16 %) in the leaves when compared to control plants. A detailed 
anatomical study of the stem during uptake and treatment revealed a stepwise mechanism of dye 
degradation. UV -vis spectrophotometric an d high performance thin layer chromatographic 
analyses confirmed the removal of parent dye from solution. Based on the enzymes activities and 
gas chromatography -mass spectroscopic analysis of degradation products, a possible pathway of 
phytotransformation of RR was proposed which revealed the formation of 4 -(phenylamino) - 
1,3,5 -triazin -2-ol, naphthalene -1-ol and 3 -(ethylsulfonyl)phenol. Toxicity study on Devario 
aequipinnatus  fishes showed that the anatomy of gills of fishes exposed to A. philoxeroides  
treated RR was largely protected. The plants were further explored for rhizofiltration experiments 
in a pilot scale reactor. A. philoxeroides  could decolorize textile industry effluent of varying pH 
within 96 h of treatment which was evident from the significa nt reductions in the values of 
American dye manufacturers' institute color, chemical oxygen demand, biological oxygen 
demand, total dissolved and total suspended solids.  
Ipomoea aquatica , a macrophyte was found to degrade a highly sulfonated and diazo text ile dye 
Brown 5R up to 94 % within 72 h at a concentration of 200 mgL-1. Induction in the activities of 
enzymes such as azoreductase, lignin peroxidase, laccase, DCIP reductase, tyrosinase, veratryl 
alcohol oxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase was ob served in leaf and root tissue in 
response to Brown 5R exposure. There was significant reduction in contents of chlorophyll a               
(25 %), chlorophyll b (17 %) and carotenoids (30 %) in the leaves of plants. HPLC, FTIR, UV -vis 
spectrophotometric a nd HPTLC analyses confirmed the biotransformation and removal of parent 
dye from solution. Enzymes activities and GC -MS analysis of degradation products lead to the 
proposal of a possible pathway of phytotransformation of dye. The proposed pathway of dye 
metabolism revealed the formation of Napthalene -1,2-diamine and methylbenzene. Toxicity study 
on HepG2 cell lines showed a 3 fold decrease in toxicity of Brown 5R after phytoremediation by 
I. aquatica . Hydrophytic nature of I. aquatica  leads to its explorat ion in a combinatorial 
phytoreactor with Ipomoea hederifolia  soil bed system. Rhizofiltration with I. aquatica  and soil 
bed treatment by I. hederifolia  treated 510 L of effluent effectively within 72 h. I. aquatica  along 
with I. hederifolia  could decoloriz e textile industry effluent within 72 h of treatment as evident 
from the significant reductions in the values of COD, BOD, solids and ADMI. Further on field 
trials of treatment of textile wastewater was successfully carried out in a constructed lagoon.  
In vitro grown untransformed adventitious roots (AR) culture of Ipomoea hederifolia  and its 
endophytic fungus (EF) Cladosporium cladosporioides  decolorized Navy Blue HE2R (NB -
HE2R) at a concentration of 20 ppm up to 83.3 and 65 %, respectively within 96 h. Wh ereas the Work of some Indian researchers  
  127AR-EF consortium decolorized the dye more efficiently and gave 97 % removal within 36 h. 
Significant inductions in the enzyme activities of lignin peroxidase, tyrosinase and laccase were 
observed in roots, while enzymes like tyrosinase, laccase a nd riboflavin reductase activities were 
induced in EF. Metabolites of dye were analyzed using UV -vis spectroscopy, FTIR and gas 
chromatography -mass spectrometry. Possible metabolic pathways of NB -HE2R were proposed 
with AR, EF and AR -EF systems independent ly. Looking at the superior efficacy of AR -EF 
system, a rhizoreactor was developed for the treatment of NB -HE2R at a concentration of 1000 
ppm. Control reactor systems with independently grown AR and EF gave 94 and 85 % NB -HE2R 
removal, respectively within  36 h.The AR -EF rhizoreactor, however, gave 97 % decolorization. 
The endophyte co -ionization additionally increased root and shoot lengths of candidate plants 
through mutualism. Combined bioreactor strategies can be effectively used for future eco -friendly  
remediation purposes.  
Wild plant and tissue cultures of Ipomoea hederifolia  decolorize Scarlet RR (SRR) dye at a 
concentration of 50 mgL-1 up to 96 % and 90 % within 60 and 96 h, respectively. Significant 
induction in the enzyme activities of Lignin perox idase, laccase, 2,6 -dichlorophenol indophenol 
reductase, superoxide dismutase, catalase and tyrosinase was found in the plant roots and shoots 
during decolorization. I. hederifolia  was also able to treat a dye mixture and a real textile effluent 
efficientl y with a reduction in the American Dye Manufacturers Institute (ADMI) value (color 
removal) up to 85 % and 88 %, BOD up to 65 % and 63 % and COD up to 62 % and 68 %, 
respectively. Detailed anatomical studies of the stem and root cells of I. hederifolia  during uptake 
and degradation were carried out, showing a stepwise and mechanistic degradation of the model 
dye SRR. Products formed after dye degradation was analyzed by UV -Vis spectroscopy, FTIR, 
HPLC and HPTLC, which confirmed the phytotransformation of SR R, dye mixture and textile 
effluent. A possible pathway for the phytotransformation of SRR was proposed based on GCMS 
analysis, which confirmed the formation of different metabolites with lower molecular weights. 
The phytotoxicity study revealed the non -toxic nature of the formed products.

and Brown 5R, and textile effluent.

14.2 Research outcomes from Dr. Venkata Mohan’s Lab  
 
14.2.1 Introduction  
The dyestuffs are water -soluble dispersible organic colourants, having high potential use in 
various industrial applications (mostly in the textile and paper/leather industry as a c olouring 
material). The textile sector  consumes about 60% of the total dye production for colouration of 
various fabrics and out of it, around 10 –15% of the dyes come out through the effluents. Dyes are 
classified into various application classes (Direct,  Acid, Basic, Disperse, Reactive, Vat, etc.) and 
chemical classes (Azo, Anthraquinone, Phthalocyanine, Xanthene, Nitroso, Nitro, Thiazine, etc.). Work of some Indian researchers  
  128Dye containing wastewater from the textile industry is a mixture of many polluting substances, 
ranging from or ganochlorine -based pesticides to heavy metals associated with dyes and chemicals 
used in the dyeing process. The colored dye effluents are considered to be highly toxic to the 
aquatic biota and affect the symbiotic processes and are also considered to be c arcinogenic to 
humans. Hence, it becomes imperative that dyes should be removed from the effluents before it is 
disposed in water bodies.  
 
14.2.2 Physicochemical  
Physicochemical methods such as adsorption, precipitation, chemical oxidation, 
photodegradati on, or membrane filtration are used for treatment of dye based wastewater. Among 
various treatment technologies, adsorption onto activated carbon is proved to be one of the 
effective and reliable physicochemical treatment processes. However, the cost of ac tivated carbon 
and regeneration problems necessitated the search for other low cost adsorbents. In this context, 
various materials like inorganic clay materials, industrial waste (by -products) materials, etc. have 
been widely studied. The potential of diff erent coal based sorbents are widely available in huge 
quantities and have all physical and chemical requirements of an adsorbent. Low cost sorbent 
charfines, lignite coal, bituminous coal are studied in the process of adsorptive colour removal of 
a reacti ve dye Trisazo direct dye and C.I.Direct Brown  mixed in a proportion of 1:1 was studied 
and compared with activated carbon (F400). The results pertaining to the batch kinetic studies 
performed on the coal -dye system indicated the varied dye sorption capac ity of the tested 
adsorbents (charfines and activated carbon). Ranking of the sorbents in terms of color removal 
capacity was of the following order, activated carbon > charfines > lignite coal > bituminous coal. 
The study concludes that the initial high u ptake of dye on coal may be reasoned due to 
chemisorption interaction while gradual uptake by activated carbon may be indicative of 
physisorption interaction. Monoazo acid dye, C.I. Acid Red 88, by adsorption onto coal based 
sorbents like Lignite coal, Cha rfines and Bituminous coal and F -400 Activated carbon and by 
chemical coagulation employing Aluminum sulfate, Ferric chloride, Manganese sulfate, 
Manganese chloride and Barium chloride. Various adsorbents derived from natural materials like 
silica, coal, s oil, minerals, chitosan, etc. and waste materials like fly ash, rice husk, biogas slurry, 
silica fumes, saw dust, etc. could also studied in place of activated carbon. Although the above 
said physical and/or chemical methods have been used to treat dyes in  wastewater or effluents, 
they possess inherent limitations such as high cost, formation of hazardous byproducts and 
intensive energy requirements.  
 
14.2.3  Biological  
Despite the existence of a variety of physical and chemical treatment processes, bioreme diation of 
textile effluent is seen as an attractive and sustainable solution due to its low cost and 
environmental friendly nature. Biological processes such as biosorption, bioremediation, etc. have 
shown potential application in removal of dyes from tex tile wastewater.  
 
(A) Biosorption by viable algae  
Biosorption process is mainly manifested by cell surface sequestration; cell wall modification 
could greatly alter the adsorption capability by enhancing the binding capacity of the biomass. 
Algae has a hig h surface area to volume ratio imparting significant potential for sorption and has 
been recognized with respect to the persistent organochlorine compounds. Algal species of Work of some Indian researchers  
  129Spirogyra found in the oxidation ponds of wastewater treatment plants was used for  treatment of 
dye based effluents. Direct Red 28 and Reactive Red 2 were studied using Spirogyra sp. in viable 
form. The study concluded that the Spirogira sp. is capable of removing azo dye colour from 
aqueous phase and also it is dependent on initial alg al inoculum, dye concentration and nature of 
the dye. The colour removal was more in the case of Direct Red 28 when compared to Reactive 
Red 2.  
 
(B) Biosorption by non -viable algae  
Biosorption employing non -viable algal species ( Spirogyra sp. IO2 ) form wa s evaluated as 
biosorbent to study its potential to adsorb azo dye from aqueous phase at different pH and 
temperature (Venkata Mohan et al., 2008). Highest biosorption values (80 %) were observed at 
acidic pH (2.0) which could be attributed to the anionic sorption and indicated that the adsorbent 
surface is of H+ (cationic) -type. At lower pH values, the surface of the biosorbent turned out to be 
positively charged and this facilitated sorption of dye, probably by the anionic exchange sorption. 
These bio -macromolecules on the algal cell surfaces have several functional groups (such as 
amino, carboxyl, thiolsulfydryl and phosphate groups) and biosorption phenomena depends on 
the protonation or un protonation of these functional groups on the surface of the cel l wall. 
Relatively less dye sorption observed at basic pH range which might be attributed to the increase 
of hydroxyl ion leading to the formation of aqua -complexes thereby retarding the sorption. 
However, the dye sorption efficiency at aqueous phase pH 7. 0 was found to be lower than acidic 
pH and more than basic pH and hence with respect to the upscaling of the technology this neutral 
pH could be feasible. Increasing in operating temperature from 10 to 50°C showed a marked 
improvement in dye sorption capac ity. Rapid enhancement in the dye sorption was observed with 
increase in temperature from 10 to 20°C. The increase of the dye uptake with increase in 
temperature suggests that the dye -algal -sorption process may be attributed to endothermic nature. 
If adsor ption is governed only by physical phenomena, an increase in temperature will be 
followed by a decrease in adsorption capacity. The combined effect of ion -exchange and chemical 
sorption phenomena might be possible during the dye -algal sorption, which can b e corroborated 
with the observation from kinetics studies.  The non -viable form of algae Spirogyra IO2 revealed 
the ability of test biosorbent to remove azo dye from the aqueous phase. The sorption reaction is 
pH dependent with higher removal observed at l ow pH values. Based upon the results, the dye 
removal mechanism may be attributed to the process of biosorption, bioconversion and 
biocoagulation.  
 
(C) Enzymes  
Researchers have been focusing their attention to study enzymatic pretreatment as a potential an d 
viable alternative to conventional methods, due to its highly selective nature. Further, inhibition 
by toxic substances is minimum in enzymatic treatment and the process can operate over a broad 
aromatic concentration range with low retention time. Enzym es from various sources (fungus and 
plant based) are used for the treatment of dye based compounds. The source of the selected 
enzyme and its nature along with system conditions are found to have significant influence on the 
overall performance for polluta nt removal. The study investigate to evaluation of hydrogen 
peroxidase oxido -reductase extracted from horseradish (EC 1.11.1.7) also called as horseradish 
peroxidase (HRP) in the process of acid azo dye removal. The study revealed the effectiveness of 
the peroxidase catalyzed enzymatic reaction in the treatment of an acid azo dye in aqueous phase. 
Immobilized HRP in acrylamide matrix resulted in effective performance over the free HRP, Work of some Indian researchers  
  130while alginate entrapped HRP yielded inferior performance over the free one. Repeated 
application of enzyme was observed to be feasible with immobilized HRP beads. Hence 
researchers have been focusing their attention to study enzymatic pretreatment as a potential and 
viable alternative to conventional methods, due to its highl y selective nature. The study concludes 
that immobilized enzymes overcome the limitations of free enzymes as the stability and catalytic 
ability of free enzymes decrease with the complexity of the effluents.  
The performance of laccase -membrane reactor conf igurations viz., direct enzyme contact, enzyme 
impregnated, immobilized enzyme and a reactor system based on laccase immobilization in 
chitosan membranes was studied for  decolorization of azo dye (acid black 10 BX) using laccase 
enzyme purified from white  rot fungi  Pleurotus ostreatus  1804. Experimental data showed that 
laccase has great potential for color removal without addition of external redox mediators. 
Various process parameters viz. aqueous phase of pH 6.0, enzyme concentration of 1.75  Uml-1, 
dye concentration of 20  mgL-1, temperature of 30  °C and reaction time of 120  min were 
optimized to achieve maximum decolorization efficiencies. Moreover, different laccase -
membrane reactor configurations were tested to determine the efficacy of repeated applic ation of 
laccase on dye decolorization process. Among the different reactor configurations studied, laccase 
encapsulated in chitosan membrane showed advantages such as short -term contact period and 
reusability of enzyme for a number of cycles.  
 
(D) Anaerob ic Treatment  
The presence of sulfo and azo groups in the dye structure protects the dye molecule from attack of 
oxygenases, making them resistant to oxidative biodegradation. Therefore, these compounds are 
more difficult to degrade through conventional ae robic treatment processes and hence require 
sequential redox conditions to cleave the chromophore (anaerobic) into corresponding aromatic 
amines and for further degradation (aerobic) of toxic aromatics into simpler compounds. The 
process of anaerobic degra dation supports reductive breakdown of dye molecules by cleaving the 
chromophore into corresponding colourless aromatic amines. This breakdown is supported by the 
utilization of redox powers obtained by oxidation of a co -substrate in the surrounding 
microe nvironment. Reductive microenvironment influenced the cleavage of azo dye bond to 
intermediate compounds, using glucose as co -substrate. Anaerobic microenvironment with 
diverse bacteria degraded the dyes to the aromatic amines due to the presence of azo re ductase 
and dehydrogenase enzyme activities however complete mineralization was not observed hence 
advanced biological wastewater treatments such as sequencing batch reactor and 
biolectrochemical treatment systems could be used.  
 
(E) Sequencing batch reac tor 
Dye based effluents are normally not amenable for conventional biological wastewater treatment 
due to their recalcitrant and inhibitory nature. However, microbial methods are highly useful and 
potentially advantageous for the treatment of toxic compoun ds due to their effectiveness, 
ecofriendly nature, energy saving and less usage of chemicals.  Conventional biological treatment 
processes are seldom capable of achieving the required degree of dye degradation, while 
anaerobic processes alone cannot handle  the complete mineralization of the dye molecule. The 
ability to achieve complete mineralization of azo dye depends on the redox condition of the 
process. Sequencing batch reactor (SBR) or Periodic Discontinuous Batch Reactor (PDBR) could 
be used is a batc h analog process allows the integration of both anoxic and aerobic redox 
conditions in a single reactor, making the combination of reductive and oxidative steps possible. Work of some Indian researchers  
  131SBR/PDBR enforces controlled short -term unsteady state conditions leading to stable s teady state 
conditions in the long run. It also imposes selective pressures that can select a defined population  
which is able to degrade complex compounds, contrary to the continuous process. Metabolic 
function plays a significant role in altering the mic robial metabolism of the bacteria and has 
specific function towards substrate utilization and recalcitrant compounds removal. Anaerobic 
metabolic function facilitates reductive breakdown of azo dye molecule by cleaving the azo bond 
to the corresponding col orless aromatic amines. These aromatic amine residues from anaerobic 
decolorization resist further anaerobic degradation due to their mutagenic nature. On the contrary, 
aromatic amines could be mineralized in aerobic microenvironment by non -specific enzyme s 
through hydroxylation and ring -fission of aromatic compounds. Due to the flexibility of 
combining multiple microenvironments during operation, periodic discontinuous batch process 
might of significant interest to treat recalcitrant azo dyes. The function al role of anoxic -aerobic -
anoxic microenvironments during periodic discontinuous batch mode operation for the treatment 
of azo -dye bearing wastewater was evaluated reactor. It is a prerequisite to have 
anoxic/microaerophilic conditions to initially breakdo wn the dye molecule prior to aerobic 
mineralization. Azo dyes are prone to get reduced under anaerobic conditions to corresponding 
aromatic amines like tri -aminobenzen, aniline and 2,8,9 - triamino -1-hydroxynaphthaline 3,7 -
disulphonic acid which resisting t o further anaerobic degradation. The study concludes the 
effective performance of aerobic biocatalyst under anoxic -aerobic -anoxic microenvironment for 
the azo dye removal in periodic discontinuous batch mode operation. This was supported by the 
microbial c ommunity analysis which documented the presence of facultative bacteria in the.  
Six periodic discontinuous/sequencing batch reactors (SBR) each with a total volume of 1 liter 
were designed and fabricated. Separate bioreactors with aerobic, anoxic and anaer obic metabolic 
functions were operated in suspended growth mode. Functional behavior of anoxic -aerobic -
anoxic microenvironment on azo dye (C.I.Acid black 10B) degradation was evaluated in a 
periodic discontinuous batch mode operation for 26 cycles. Dye rem oval efficiency and azo -
reductase activity (30.50 ± 1 Units) increased with each feeding event until 13th cycle and further 
stabilized. Dehydrogenase activity also increased gradually and stabilized (2.0 ± 0.2 µgml-1) 
indicating the stable proton shuttling  between metabolic intermediates providing higher number 
of reducing equivalents towards dye degradation. Voltammetric profiles showed drop in redox 
catalytic currents during stabilized phase also supports the consumption of reducing equivalents 
towards dy e removal. Change in Tafel slopes, polarization resistance and other bioprocess 
parameters correlated well with the observed dye removal and biocatalyst behavior. Microbial 
community analysis documented the involvement of specific organism pertaining to ae robic and 
facultative functions with heterotrophic and autotrophic metabolism. Integrating anoxic 
microenvironment with aerobic operation might have facilitated effective dye mineralization due 
to the possibility of combining reduction -oxidation functions.  
Functional role of anoxic and anaerobic metabolic functions during the periodic discontinuous 
batch mode operation in comparison with aerobic metabolic function during the treatment of azo 
dye bearing wastewater was evaluated to understand the shifts in b iocatalyst metabolic activities 
with the function of terminal electron acceptor (TEA). Higher dye removal was observed under 
anoxic operation followed by the anaerobic and aerobic. The study concludes as competence of 
oxygen with dye as TEA might be the re ason for the observed lower dye degradation under 
aerobic operation. Moreover, function of dye as a TEA along with the micro -aerophilic 
conditions, facilitating the oxidation of dye metabolites, might be the reason for the observed 
higher dye removal.  Ind ucing anoxic microenvironment in multi -phase metabolic shift (MP) Work of some Indian researchers  
  132strategy during periodic discontinuous batch/sequencing batch (PDBR/SBR) mode operation 
showed enhanced degradation of azo dye. Two reactors with aerobic and anoxic metabolic 
conditions were  operated by varying time intervals of anoxic and aerobic microenvironments 
(before multiphase (BMP); after multiphase (AMPI, AMPII, AMPIII). Higher dye removal was 
observed after applying multiphase strategy (anoxic -AMPIII, 62 %; aerobic -AMPIII, 58.5 %) 
compared to BMP (anoxic, 49 %; aerobic, 42 %). Higher azo reductase (31 ± 0.13 U), 
dehydrogenase activities (3.18 µgml-1) and redox catalytic currents were observed in anoxic -
AMPIII operation compared to corresponding aerobic -AMPIII. Extending multiple anox ic phases 
resulted in secreting the redox shuttles by biocatalyst for their survival against the toxic dye 
environment. MP strategy extending multiple anoxic phases aided in expanding the capabilities of 
SBR/PDBR operation for more viable treatment applica tion. Irrespective of the operating 
conditions, the carbon source will undergo degradation during biocatalyst metabolic activities to 
form end products along with the generation of reduced electron carriers (NAD+, FAD+, FMN+, 
etc.). These reducing powers s hould be re -oxidized in the cell to re -enter the metabolic pathways 
or else all the redox reactions get lagged and hence their re -oxidation is considered crucial . 
Effect of dye shock load on the process performance of biofilm and suspended configured 
perio dic discontinuous batch mode operation (PDBR) in response to the treatment of azo dye (C.I. 
Acid Black 10B) bearing wastewater was studied. Reactors were operated at varying dye/COD 
ratio (0.16, 0.23, 0.33 and 0.41) (Kumnar et al., 2014). During higher dye  loading operation (1250 
mg dyeL-1) biofilm mode resulted in higher dye removal (74.5 %) than the corresponding 
suspended mode operation (42 %). With each additional dye loading event azo reductase and 
dehydrogenase enzyme activity also increased. Azo redu ctase enzyme was isolated from both the 
cultures and its molecular weight was determined by SDS -PAGE and was found to be 94 kDa.  
The performance of PDBR operation on treatment of real -field wastewater was evaluated using 
PDBR/SBR and continuous mode opera tion and by varying microenvironment (aerobic, anoxic 
and anaerobic). Among the operation mode studies, PDBR mode documented significant higher 
performance in the treatment of wastewater. In the case of reactor microenvironment, anoxic and 
aerobic system d ocumented treatment efficiency than the corresponding anaerobic operation.  
 
(F)  Multi -phase metabolic shift strategy  
PDBR/SBR operation is integration of two variable microenvironments in a single reactor system, 
especially beneficial for the dye -based wa stewater treatment. Due to its unique flexibility to 
combine multiple metabolic functions (redox conditions) during operation, PDBR/SBR process 
attracted significant interest in treating recalcitrant compounds. The consecutive variation of 
anoxic and aerob ic conditions facilitated cyclic sequence of anoxic and aerobic microenvironment 
in the multiphases operation in a single cycle. Though the biocatalyst (aerobic) was the same in 
all the strategies, variations in the dye degradation was observed with and wi thout multiphase 
operation.  Shifts in microbial metabolism with the function of aerobic, anaerobic and anoxic 
microenvironments were evaluated in periodic discontinuous batch mode operation in response to 
the treatment of azo dye (C.I.Acid Black 10B) bear ing wastewater. Anoxic microenvironment 
depicted higher dye removal efficiency (95.18 %) followed by anaerobic (93.67 %) and aerobic 
(68.77 %) microenvironments. Switching between aerobic and anaerobic microenvironment 
during anoxic operation facilitated t he reduction of dye to its intermediates (anaerobic) followed 
by the mineralization of these intermediates (aerobic). Function of dye as a TEA along with the 
limited oxygen available might be the reason for the observed higher dye removal under anoxic 
microenvironment. Azo reductase activity showed marginal variation with the function of anoxic Work of some Indian researchers  
  133and anaerobic microenvironment indicating the similar capabilities of the biocatalyst. However, 
dehydrogenase activity showed significant variation with the function  of microenvironment 
indicating the differences in the delivery of reducing powers from the substrate metabolism 
towards dye removal. The bio -electro kinetics showed well correlation with the redox reactions, 
enzyme activities and dye removal. Microbial in ventory analysis documented the involvement of 
organisms with anaerobic and facultative metabolic functions having heterotrophic and 
autotrophic nutrition modes. Aerobic operation documented the dominance of facultative (83 %) 
followed by aerobic (17 %) ba cteria while anoxic and anaerobic operations facilitated the 
distribution of facultative (67 % and 83 % respectively) and anaerobic (33 % and 17 % 
respectively) bacteria.  
Anoxic microenvironment switches between oxidation and reduction depending on the oxy gen 
availability. Study was evaluated to understand the metabolic shifts by altering operating 
microenvironment specifically inducing anoxic condition on azo dye degradation during PDBR 
process.  The study concluded the advantage of multi phasing and incre menting anoxic phasing 
on the degradation of recalcitrant azo dye during PDBR/SBR operation. Varying anoxic and 
aerobic microenvironments more anoxic conditions initially followed by more aerobic conditions 
in latter stages of cycle operation enhanced the overall treatment efficiency. Moreover, these 
studies will help to comprehend and design effective redox integration mechanism for treatment 
of complex wastewater.  
 
(G) Biofilm verses Suspension microbes influence  
Microbes/bacteria play important role in the biological degradation processes in which the 
processes under goes diverse biochemical pathways.  Hence to understand the functional role of 
biofilm (self immobilized) and suspended growth bioreactor configurations in response to the 
treatment of azo -dye bearing wastewater was evaluated in periodic discontinuous batch mode 
operation at varying dye concentrations. Relatively, biofilm system depicted higher dye removal 
efficiency compared to suspended mode. Functional role of biofilm and suspended growth 
bioreactor configurations in response to the treatment of azo -dye (C.I. Acid Black 10B) bearing 
wastewater was evaluated in periodic discontinuous batch mode operation at varying dye 
concentrations.  The biofilm system depicted higher dye removal efficiency (93.14 %) compared 
to suspended mode (84.29 %) at 350 mg dyeL-1 operation.  Both reactor configurations didn’t 
show much process inhibition at the higher dye loads studied. Azo reductase and dehydrogenase 
enzyme activities showed significant variation indic ating the different metabolic capabilities of 
the native -microflora,  stable proton shuttling between metabolic intermediates,  and differences in 
the delivery of reducing powers from the substrate metabolism towards dye removal. 
Voltammograms visualized mar ked variations in electron discharge properties with the function 
of reactor configuration, time intervals and dye load. Higher redox catalytic currents, lower Tafel 
slopes and polarization resistance showed good correlation with enzyme activities and dye 
removal. Self -immobilization of microflora as biofilm results in high biomass hold up, thus 
enables the process to be operated significantly at higher liquid throughputs and organic load 
which are well suited for the treatment of wastewater containing poor ly degradable compounds. 
Biofilm systems are particularly useful where high hydraulic loading variations occur and where 
slowly growing organisms with special metabolic capacities are to be protected from washout. 
Moreover, attached biofilm acts as a buffe r to reduce the concentration of toxic chemicals during 
process operation thereby providing advantage for the treatment of dye based wastewater 
containing recalcitrant compounds. The study concludes that effective performance of biofilm Work of some Indian researchers  
  134mode of operation c ompared to suspended growth configurations with regard to azo dye removal 
during PDBR operation.  
 
14.2.4 Bioelectrochemical treatment systems (BET)  
Bioelectrochemical treatment systems are typically a type of microbial fuel cell (MFC), a 
promising technolo gy for electricity production, which can be advantageously combined with 
applications in wastewater treatment. When the major attention is on treatment rather than 
electricity production, MFC can also be termed as bioelectrochemical treatment (BET). BET us e 
electrodes as solid electron acceptor for bacteria respiration and exploit microbial catabolic 
activities to generate electrons (e_) and protons (H+) by degrading organic molecules. The 
microbial metabolism is linked via electron donating and accepting c onditions through the 
presence of artificial introduced electrodes (anode and cathode), which induces the development 
of a potential difference that acts as a net driving force for bioelectrogenic activity and complex 
dye removal. The functional activity o f anaerobic bacteria in the presence of an electrode as solid 
electron acceptor was comprehensively evaluated during the treatment of azo dye based 
wastewater (Sreelatha et al., 2015). The study provides a new insight into the electron acceptor 
dependent r espiration wherein the electrode serving as a solid electron acceptor enables efficient 
function of anode respiring bacteria (ARB) in terms of electron flux towards dye degradation and 
electrogenesis. The study also documented electron acceptor dependent r espiration, exemplifying 
the influence of conjunction between electrode and bacteria on dye degradation.  
A comparative study between bioelectrochemical treatment system with the presence of electrode 
assembly and biocatalyst,  anaerobic treatment  and abi otic-control comprising of an electrode 
assembly without biocatalyst explained the specific influence of the electrode assembly as a solid 
electron acceptor in the  presence of biocatalyst are of crucial importance as the terminal 
reduction reactions for d ye degradation. The BET system functioned with coupled action of the 
electrode assembly as a solid electron acceptor as well as bacteria as a biocatalyst, resulting in 
significant dye remediation with simultaneous power generation in comparison to the anae robic 
treatment and abiotic -control operations. Electron flux between a microbe and solid phase are by 
two overlapping mechanisms such as direct and mediated transfer. Direct cell -electrode contact 
with bacterial outer membrane bound cytochromes serving as  reductases as well as dye molecules 
functioning as electron shuttles. Electrode assembly induces the development of potential 
difference by the biocatalytic action of electrochemically active bacteria enriched around the 
electrodes in carrying out the sim ultaneous redox reactions towards the breakdown of dye 
molecules. Besides, the breakdown of complex dye molecule results in the generation of reduced 
dye intermediates that in turn acts as redox mediators/electron shuttles during the transfer of 
electrons to the solid electron acceptor/ for the other dye molecule reduction enabling the 
mediated electron acceptor. Bio-electrogenic activity enhanced when bacterial respiration was 
coupled with the electrode assembly in treating/utilizing the azo dye based wast ewater which can 
be attributed to the electron acceptor -dependent respiration. The study clearly documented that 
absence of electrode assembly in AnT system and bacteria in abiotic -control system respectively, 
resulted in low performance in terms of azo dy e degradation however compiling both the 
processes in the single system as BET procures the advantage of electron acceptor dependent 
respiration offering dual benefits of dye degradation and power generation.  
Integration of two multiple processes aids in a chieving enhanced treatment efficiency, more 
specifically with dye based wastewaters by considering the advantage of both the processes SBR Work of some Indian researchers  
  135followed by BET  was developed to achieve enhanced treatment efficiency (Nagendranatha and 
Venkata Mohan, 2016). BET  was designed to evaluate complete mineralization of partially 
treated dye effluent obtained from anoxically operated Periodic discontinuous batch reactor 
(PDBR) for simultaneous bioelectricity generation and recovery of nutrients (nage. In MET 
bioreactor,  anode and cathode chambers were fed with designed synthetic wastewater (DSW) and 
PDBR dye effluents. The dye metabolite (NH 4+) will be converted to nitrates by the activity of 
aerobic biocatalyst present in cathode chamber to be used as biofertilizer. Dye  removal of 90.2 % 
was observed with good electrogenic activity (voltage (OCV)/current; 395  mV/1.77  mA). The 
mineralization of dye and its intermediates were assessed by reduction in overall toxicity from 23 
to 4 %. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal eff iciency of 75 % (anode) and 88 % (cathode) 
were observed in correspondence to higher azoreductase (18.7  U; 4 8 h) and dehydrogenase 
(1.66  µgml-1 of toluene; 24  h) enzyme activities which correlated well with metabolic activities of 
biocatalyst. Bioelectrocatalytic behavior of mixed biocatalyst on the basis of redox catalytic 
currents and prevalence of redox media tors signified the specific function of electron transfer 
toward dye mineralization. The results obtained suggest that the use of BET can considerably 
degrade toxic pollutants and provides nitrate rich solution (biofertilizer). Utilization of recovere d 
nutrients directly to farms without any energy intensive methods is reported in this 
communication. The possible integration of two different processes paves a way towards 
sustainability by addressing product recovery and bioremediation. The increment of nitr ates 
concentration in cathode chamber correlates well with the decrease in ammonical nitrogen, dye 
and toxicity. The catholyte containing high nitrates and low COD may be used directly in the 
farms for plant growth as the nitrates are present in easy uptak e form.  
Over all the above mentioned advanced biological processes could be an effective solution for the 
treatment of dye based wastewater. These technologies could remediate the areas affected by dye 
based wastewaters and a pave way to reopen the textil e industries. Apart from dye based 
wastewater, these advanced biological and bioelectrochemical processes could be used to treat 
wastewaters originating from chemical and allied industries which are highly complex in nature. 
Developing sustainable wastewat er treatment technologies for management of complex 
wastewater in a cost effective approach is in need. Valorisation of the waste achieved through 
cascade level integration of various biotechnology processes that utilize biogenic segment of the 
waste and p roduce high value bioproducts. Finally, waste mining deemed as one of the prominent 
areas with superior commercial interest considering the various possibilities of resource recovery.  
Integrating various bioprocesses by in a sequential unit operation and p rocesses with 
simultaneous production of value added products and biofuel generation could significantly 
contribute to the society in terms of waste management, pollution control, climate change and 
global warming along with energy recovery and value added  products.  
 
14.3 Research Outcomes from the Prof. Jyoti Jadhav’s Lab  
 
14.3.1 Biodegradation of triphenylmethane dyes by Penicillium  ochrochloron       
 
(A) Results, summary and major outcomes  
The present study dealt with the decolorization and degradation of triphenyl methane textile dye 
by mycelium of  Penicillium ochrochloron . Spectrophotometric and visual examinations showed 
that the decolorization was through fungal adsorption, followed by degradation.  Work of some Indian researchers  
  136Triphenylmethane dyes belong to the most important g roup of synthetic colorants and are used 
extensively in the textile industries for dying cotton, wool, silk, nylon, etc. They are generally 
considered as the xenobiotic compounds, which are very recalcitrant to 
biodegradation.  Penicillium  ochrochloron  decolorizes cotton blue (50  mgL−1) within 2.5  h under 
static condition at pH 6.5 and temperature 25  °C. TLC, FTIR and HPLC analysis confirms 
biodegradation of cotton blue. FTIR spectroscopy and GC –MS analysis indicated sulphonamide 
and triphenylmethane as the final products of cotton bl ue degradation. The pH, temperature and 
maturity of biomass affected the rate of decolorization. Presence of lignin peroxidase, tyrosinase 
and aminopyrine N -demethylase activities in the cell homogenate as well as increase in the 
extracellular activity of lignin peroxidase suggests the role of these enzymes in the decolorization 
process. The phytotoxicity and microbial toxicity studies of extracted metabolites suggest the less 
toxic nature of them.  
Malachite green was detoxified into p -benzyl -N,N-dimethylan iline and N,N -dimethyl -aniline 
hydrochloride by Penicillium ochrochloron . Degradation metabolites were analyzed by TLC, 
HPLC and FTIR and identified by GCMS analysis. Phytotoxicity testing revealed the nontoxic 
nature of these metabolites. The percentage d ecolorization of malachite green (50 mgL-1) was 93 
% in czapek dox broth after 14 h with an optimum pH of 7 at 30oC. The induction in the activity 
of lignin peroxidase after degradation suggested that the degradation of malachite green was 
peroxidase -media ted. Fungal culture was also found to have detoxified the textile effluent. The 
values of TDS, TSS, COD, and BOD were reduced in the treated samples compared to the control 
effluent. The treated effluent was non -toxic to the plants of Triticum aestivum  and Ervum lens  
Linn, and the amount of total chlorophyll was higher in plants with treated effluent when 
compared to control effluent. This study showed that fungal mycelia could effectively be used as 
an alternative to the traditional physico -chemical proces s. 
(B) Major highlights of the project  
Penicillium ochrochloron  was found to decolorize textile dye Malachite green, Cotton blue. This 
study suggests that this strain could be a useful tool for textile effluent treatment and the 
alternative to the traditio nal physicochemical process.

14.5.1 Textile dye decolorization using cyanobacteria  
(A) Results, summ ary and major outcomes  
Cyanobacterial cultures isolated from sites polluted by industrial textile effluents were screened 
for their ability to decolorize cyclic azo dyes. Gloeocapsa pleurocapsoides and Phormidium 
ceylanicum decolorized Acid Red 97 and FF S ky Blue dyes by more than 80 % after 26 days. 
Chroococcus minutus was the only culture which decolorized Amido Black 10B (55 %). 
Chlorophyll a synthesis in all cultures was strongly inhibited by the dyes. Visible spectroscopy 
and TLC confirmed that color r emoval was due to degradation of the dyes.  
 
(B) Major highlights of the work  
The present study confirms the ability of cyanobacteria to decolorize and degrade structurally 
different dyes. Further studies are needed to identify the biochemical machinery inv olved in the 
degradation.  
 
14.5.2  Microaerophilic Symmetric Reductive Cleavage of Reactive Azo Dye -Remazole 
Brilliant Violet 5R by Consortium VIE6: Community Synergism  
 
(A) Results, summary and major outcomes  
The textile -dyeing industry is rated as one of  the foremost industrial sectors that explodes large 
amount of pollutants to the environment. Reactive azo dye degradation, being a major constituent 
of these pollutants and perilous material, has been constantly receiving scientific attention. In 
textile industry, use of Remazole Brilliant Violet 5R (RBV5R) as reactive azo dyes is more 
frequent. Highly competent, RBV5R -degrading bacterial consortium VIE6 was developed from 
the soil of the Vatva Industrial Estate, Gujarat, India. Consortium VIE6 comprised o f five 
bacterial strains Bacillus  sp. DMB1, Staphylococcus  sp. DMB2, Escherichia  sp. DMB3, 
Enterococcus  sp. DMB4, and Pseudomonas  sp. DMB5. These strains convened a better 
decolorization efficiency between 200 and 1000 mgL-1 of dye concentration and were m uch 
stable at pH 6.5, 37 °C. Azoreductase, laccase, and lignin peroxidase activities of consortium 
showed significant variation throughout the degradation process indicating the different metabolic 
capabilities of the existing microflora. The community int eractions and synergism were shown to 
facilitate the biotransformation of RBV5R by combination of various electron donors. 
Voltammograms revealed the variations in electron discharge properties which coincide with the 
dynamics of community derived using qP CR assays. The variation in catabolic capabilities of the 
individual strains was observed during active metabolism of RBV5R degradation pertaining to the 
aerobic and facultative functions  
 
(B) Major highlights of the work  
The present bioremediation strateg y demonstrates a potent consortium VIE6 that not only 
reductively cleave substituted sulfonated aromatic dyes but also simultaneously detoxify them 
along with consistent growth without much requirement of persistent nutrients. The results 
suggested that mi croaerophilic bacterial azoreduction was a respiratory mechanism and generated 
enough energy through an electron transport process to support consortial growth. This 
respiration process enhances the azoreduction process, which plays a significant and direc t role in Work of some Indian researchers  
  139azo dye metabolism. To decipher the specific mechanism of microaerophilic bacterial azo 
reduction, it requires further study; however, here we have demonstrated a synergistic mechanism 
for possible bioremediation strategy for sites contaminated w ith azo dyes.  
 
14.5.3 Kinetic Modeling and Community Dynamics of Microaerophilic Treatment of Textile 
Dyes Containing Effluent by Consortium VIE6  
 
(A) Results, summary and major outcomes  
A semi -synthetic designed medium (SDM), containing azo dyes, salts an d other additives, was 
treated in a laboratory -scale upflow microaerophilic fixed -film bioreactor (UMFB) at various 
hydraulic retention times (HRT) in order to obtain efficient COD removal and decolorization 
using consortium VIE6. Grau’s second order and m odified Stover -Kincannon substrate removal 
kinetic models were the best fitting models for the steady -state experimental data of UMFB. The 
efficacy of microaerophilic process to treat SDM at varying shock -loads (high dye and salt 
concentrations) was assess ed simultaneously. The best organic matter removal efficiency, 
measured as Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), was 98 % and decolorization was 99 % at 2 d 
HRT. UMFB endured shock -loads of dye and salts up to 500 mgL-1 and 80 gL-1, respectively, at   
2 d HRT. Bio -film configured system operating in UMFB, having charcoal as supporting 
material; showed overall better efficiency in treating SDM, and even after reactor completion, the 
bio-film remained in immobilized form showed its stability to withstand the toxic sh ock loads. In 
addition, metabolites produced during microaerophilic processes were determined along with 
community dynamics of consortium VIE6. The role of each organism in a community was 
elucidated based on their dominance in the effluent at 2 d HRT. Mor eover, phytotoxicity analysis 
of SDMand its bio -degraded products after treatment showed acute decline in the toxicity of 
metabolites as compared to SDM.  
 
(B) Major highlights of the work  
The present bioremediation strategy demonstrated the application of the potent consortium VIE6 
that not only reductively cleaved substituted sulfonated aromatic dyes but simultaneously 
detoxified them along with consistent growth without much requirement of persistent nutrients 
under UMFB process. Consortium VIE6 could wit hstand the large shock -loads of dye (500 mgL-
1) and salts (80 gL-1) during UMFB treatment. The increased capability of consortium to degrade 
dye is due to integration of two microenvironments in a single process. It is apparent from the 
study, that charcoa l, being porous inert material, enhanced the consortial biofilm formation and 
propped it firmly to withstand various shocks -loads. The UMFB process here not only degraded 
the dye and organic matter but also a certain level of phosphate, sulfate, phenolics and 
nitrogenous compounds were removed during the process. However, community synergism of 
consortium VIE6 was commendable during treatment processes which completely detoxified the 
effluent.  
 
14.5.4 Transformation of Textile Dyes by White -Rot Fungus Trame tes versicolor  
 
(A) Results, summary and major outcomes  
We have investigated transformation of eight industrial dyes by a white rot fungus, Trametes 
versicolor . The fungus was found to decolorize Reactive Golden Yellow R, Procion Red, Work of some Indian researchers  
  140Reactive Violet 5, Re active Blue 28, and Ponceau Red 4R at an initial dye concentration of 80 
ppm within 72 h of incubation, whereas it took 5 d to completely decolorize Reactive Black 5        
(40 ppm). However, it did not significantly decolorize Reactive Red 152 and Novatic  Blue BC 
S/D. During decolorization in liquid medium, laccase and manganese -independent peroxidase 
(MiP) activities were detected in culture filtrate of T. versicolor . Dye -decolorizing activity of the 
culture was found to be associated with H2O2 -dependent activity of the culture filtrate. 
Furthermore, dye -decolorizing activity of the culture filtrate was not influenced by Mn2+ or 
veratryl alcohol, thus suggesting a role of extracellular MiP in decolorization of synthetic dyes by  
T. versicolor . 
 
(B) Major hi ghlights of the work  
Our results can be useful in understanding the fact that a relationship was not observed between 
MnP activity and the decolorization rate Pleurotus ostreatus produces MiP, which is involved in 
decolorization of Remazol Brilliant Blue R  Heinfling et al. have demonstrated transformation of 
several industrial dyes by MiP isoenzymes purified from Bjerkandera adusta and Pleurotus 
eryngii . Our results further support the role of MiP enzyme obtained from T. versicolor in dye 
decolorization.  
 
14.5.5  Decolorization screening of synthetic dyes by anaerobic methanogenic sludge using a 
batch decolorization assay  
 
(A) Results, summary and major outcomes  
The nonspecific ability of anaerobic sludge bacteria obtained from cattle dung slurry was 
investi gated for 17 different dyes in a batch assay system using sealed serum vials. Experiments 
using Reactive violet 5 (RV5) showed that sludge bacteria could effectively decolorize solutions 
having dye concentrations up to 1000 mgL-1 with a decolorization effi ciency of above 75 % 
during 48 h of incubation. Headspace gas composition of anaerobic batch systems for varying dye 
concentration revealed that lower concentrations of RV5 (upto 500 mgL-1) were found to be 
stimulatory to the methanogenic activity of sludg e bacteria. However at higher dye 
concentrations, the headspace gas composition was found to be similar to batch assay controls 
without dye, indicating that dye at higher concentrations was inhibitory to methanogenic bacteria 
of sludge. The optimum inoculu m and incubation temperature for maximum decolorization of RV 
5 was found to be 9.0 gL-1 (in terms of total solids) and 37 ºC, respectively. Of sixteen other dyes 
tested, nine (Reactive Black 5, Reactive Blue 31, Reactive Blue 28, Reactive Red HE8B, 
Reacti ve Yellow, Reactive Golden Yellow, Mordant Orange, Novatic Olive R S/D & Navilan 
Yellow GL) were decolorized with more than 88% efficiency; three (Orange II, Navy Blue HER 
& Novatic Blue BC S/D) were decolorized with about 50 – 65 % efficiency, whereas oth er three 
dyes (Procion Orange H2R, Procion Brilliant Blue HGR & Novatic Blue BC S/D) were 
decolorized with less than 40 % efficiency. Though Ranocid Fast Blue was decolorized with 
about 92.5 % efficiency, this was merely due to sorption, whereas the other dyes were decolorized 
due to biotransformation.  
 
(B) Major highlights of the work  
It is noteworthy to mention here that the anaerobic sludge bacteria used in this study were not 
previously exposed to these kinds of xenobiotic compounds; however they were a ble to act on azo Work of some Indian researchers  
  141dyes. This observation that unadapted sludge bacteria can decolorize azo dyes is important 
because it opens up the prospect of developing anaerobic treatment systems which can easily 
decolorize azo dyes in industrial wastewaters and also possesses potential advantages over 
systems using defined bacterial cultures  
 
14.5.6 Co -metabolic degradation of diazo dye -Reactive blue 160 by enriched mixed cultures 
BDN  
 
(A) Results, summary and major outcomes  
Mixed cultures BDN (BDN) proficient in dec olourizing diazo dye – reactive blue 160 (RB160) 
consist of eight bacterial strains, was developed through culture enrichment method from soil 
samples contaminated with anthropogenic activities. The synthrophic interactions of BDN have 
led to complete deco lourization and degradation of RB160 (100 mgL-1) within 4 h along with co -
metabolism of yeast extract (0.5 %) in minimal medium. BDN microaerophilicaly decolourized 
even 1500 mgL-1 of RB160 underhigh saline conditions (20 gL-1 NaCl) at 37ºC and pH 7.0. BDN  
exhibited broad substrate specificity and decolourized 27 structurally different dyes. The 
reductase enzymes symmetrically cleaved RB160 and oxidative enzymes further metabolised the 
degraded products and five different intermediates were identified using  FTIR, 1HNMR and GC –
MS. The phytotoxicity assay confirmed that intact RB160 was more toxic than dye degraded 
intermediates. The BDN was able to colonize and decolourized RB160 in soil model system in 
presence of indigenous miocroflora as well as in sterile  soil without any amendment of additional 
nutrients, which signifies it useful and potential application in bioremediation.  
 
(B) Major highlights of the work  
Bacterial mediated remediation of recalcitrant dyes of anthro -pogenic origin offers great 
opportun ity for the restoration of dyecontaminated environments in an ecologically acceptable 
manner.As noted above bacteria in community rather than as individ -ual pure cultures are well 
efficient for complete mineralization ofany pollutants. Therefore, we have d eveloped the potent 
bacterialmixed cultures BDN that not only cleaved substituted sulphonatedaromatic dye but 
simultaneously detoxify the degraded interme -diates at a faster rate under ambient conditions. 
The consistentgrowth of BDN at flask conditions and  ability to colonize in soilsystem with 
minimal nutrient requirement and concurrent degra -dation of toxic dye compounds signifies its 
potential application forin situ bioremediation.  
 
14.5.7 Decolorization and degradation of azo dye – Reactive Violet 5R by  an acclimatized 
indigenous bacterial mixed cultures -SB4 isolated from anthropogenic dye 
contaminated soil  
 
(A) Results, summary and major outcomes  
Azo dyes an important group of synthetic compounds are recalcitrant xenobiotics. Conventional 
technologies a re unsuccessful to efficiently remove these compounds from contaminated 
environment. However, consorted metabolic functioning of innate microbial communities is a 
promising approach for bioremediation of polluted environment. Bacterial mixed cultures SB4 
proficient in complete decolorization of azo dye – Reactive Violet 5R was developed through 
culture enrichment technique. Bacterial community composition based on 16S rRNA gene Work of some Indian researchers  
  142analysis revealed that mixed cultures SB4 composed of six bacterial strains name ly Bacillus  sp. 
V1DMK, Lysinibacillus  sp. V3DMK, Bacillus  sp. V5DMK, Bacillus  sp. V7DMK, 
Ochrobacterium  sp. V10DMK, Bacillus  sp. V12DMK. SB4 grew well in minimal medium 
containing low amount of glucose and yeast extract (YE) (1 gL-1) and decolorized 200 mg L-1 of 
RV5 within 18 h under static condition. Mixed cultures SB4 decolorized wide range of azo dyes 
and maximum rate of decolorization was observed at 37 ºC and pH 7.0. Decolorization efficiency 
was found to be unaltered under high RV5 and salt concentrat ion where 1500 mgL-1 of RV5 was 
decolorized in presence of 20 gL-1 NaCl. We propose the asymmetric cleavage of RV5 and 
Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR), NMR and gas chromatography –mass spectrometry (GC –
MS) confirmed the formation of four intermediatory compounds 1 -diazo -2-naphthol, 4 -
hydroxybenzenesulphonic acid, 2 -naphthol and benzenesulphonic acid.  
 
(B) Major highlights of the work  
In the present scenario of environmental pollution, its restoration is a mammoth challenge. The 
acquired knowledge of thei r hazards and the strict legislation has led for implementation of 
several strategies for cleaning up the environment. Inspite of having spent several decades we are 
still searching for an optimistic approach and in view of that present bioremediation stra tegy 
demonstrated the potency of enriched bacterial mixed cultures SB4 efficiently decolorizing and 
degrading high concentration of azo dye RV5 with minimal nutritional requirement. The ability to 
decolorize wide array of dyes under ambient conditions and complete mineralization of RV5 
indicated the useful application of SB4 for ex situ bioremediation. The synergy of results obtained 
has forced us to study further and now our lab is working to isolate the genes responsible for dye 
degradation from these mix ed cultures with an aim to design a strain capable to degrading several 
dyes.  
 
14.5.8 Production of Ligninolytic Enzymes for Dye Decolorization by Cocultivation of 
White -Rot Fungi Pleurotus ostreatus  and Phanerochaete chrysosporium  Under Solid -
State Fermen tation  
 
(A) Results, summary and major outcomes  
Lignocellulosic wastes such as neem hull, wheat bran, and sugarcane bagasse, available in 
abundance, are excellent substrates for the production of ligninolytic enzymes under solid -state 
fermentation by white -rot fungi. A ligninolytic enzyme system with high activity showing 
enhanced decomposition was obtained by cocultivation of Pleurotus ostreatus and Phanerochaete 
chrysosporium on combinations of lignocellulosic waste. Among the various substrate 
combinatio ns examined, neem hull and wheat bran wastes gave the highest ligninolytic activity. 
A maximum production of laccase of 772 Ug-1 and manganese peroxidase of 982 Ug-1 was 
obtained on 20 d and lignin peroxidase of 656 Ug-1 on 25 d at 28 ± 1°C under solid -state 
fermentation. All three enzymes thus obtained were partially purified by acetone fractionation and 
were exploited for decolorizing different types of acid and reactive dyes.  
 
(B) Major highlights of the work  
Our study demonstrates successful optimizatio n of lignocellulosic waste decomposition and 
production of ligninolytic enzymes, which could be further exploited for decolorization of 
synthetic dyes.  Work of some Indian researchers

15.5.9 Decolourization of synthetic dyes by a newly isolated strain of Serratia marcescens  
(A) Results,  summary and major outcomes  
A novel dye -decolourizing strain of the bacterium Serratia marcescens  efficiently decolourized 
two chemically different dyes Ranocid Fast Blue (RFB) and Procion Brilliant Blue -H-GR (PBB -
HGR) belonging respectively to the azo and  anthraquinone groups. Extracellular laccase and 
manganese peroxidase (MnP) activity were detected during dye decolourization. The involvement 
of MnP activity was found in the decolourization of both dyes. More than 90 % decolourization 
of PBB -HGR and RFB was obtained on days 8 and 5, respectively at 26 ºC under static 
conditions at pH 7.0. MnP activity was increased by the addition of Mn2+. At 50 µM Mn2+, high 
MnP (55.3 Uml-1) but low laccase activity (8.3 Uml-1) was observed. Influence of oxalic acid on 
MnP activity was also observed.  
 
(B) Major highlights of the work  
The present study confirms that the use of the newly isolated Serratia marcescen s strain for 
decolourization of structurally different synthetic dyes is possible. The dye decolourization was 
very fast compared to white rot fungi. Nevertheless, the fungal -based treatment system is less 
efficient and time -consuming due to the slow growt h rate of fungi as well as high adsorption to 
the biomass. The exploitation of S. marcescens  would be help to overcome the difficulties 
associated with the use of mycelial organisms for dye decolourization and to develop an efficient 
technology for the rem oval of dyes from dyes -containing effluents using a bacterial species.  
 
14.5.10 Decolorization of azo dyes using Basidiomycete  strain PV 002  
 
(A) Results, summary and major outcomes  
Basidiomycete PV 002, a recently isolated white -rot strain from decomposed  neem waste 
displayed high extracellular peroxidase and rapidly decolorized azo dyes. In this study, the 
optimal culture conditions for efficient production of ligninolytic enzymes were determined with 
respect to carbon and nitrogen. An additional objectiv e was to determine the efficiency of PV 002 
to degrade the azo dyes. White -rot strain PV 002 efficiently decolorized Ranocid Fast Blue                  
(96 %) and Acid Black 210 (70 %) on day 5 and 9 respectively under static conditions. The 
degradation of  azo dyes under different conditions was strongly correlated with the ligninolytic 
activity. The optimum growth temperature of strain PV 002 was 26 ºC and pH 7.0.  
 
(B) Major highlights of the work  
The Basidiomycete strain PV 002 efficiently transformed azo  dyes. The dye decolorization was 
very fast compared with well -known selected white -rot fungi. Since nutrient limitation is not 
required for ligninolytic activity in Basidiomycete strain PV 002, further studies should attempt to  
increase degradation of the  other recalcitrant compounds (e.g. PAH) by cheap organic rich 
supplements, which are known to stimulate peroxidase production. Such a biological process 
could be adopted as a cost -effective, safer and efficient approach for decolorization of effluents. 
Further work needs to be performed using this fungal system with the objective of reducing cost 
of the process significantly.

  14414.5.11 Decolourization of textile dye Reactive Violet 5 by a newly isolated bacterial 
consortium RVM 11.1  
 
(A) Results, summary an d major outcomes  
Soil samples collected from contaminated sites of Vatva, Gujarat, India were studied for 
screening and isolation of organisms capable of decolourizing textile dyes. A bacterial consortium 
RVM11.1 was selected on the basis of rapid dye deco lourization. Reactive Violet 5 (RV 5) was 
used as model dye. The consortium exhibited 94 % decolourization ability within 37 h under a 
wide pH range from 6.5 to 8.5 and temperature ranging from 25 to 40 ºC. The bacterial 
consortium was able to grow and dec olourize RV5 under static conditions in the presence of 
glucose and yeast extract and also showed an ability to decolourize in the presence of starch in 
place of glucose. Maximum decolourization efficiency was observed at 200 ppm (mgL-1) 
concentration of R V 5. Bacterial consortium RVM11.1 had the ability to decolourize 10 different 
dyes tested. The transformation and degradation products after decolourization were examined by 
HPTLC.  
 
(B) Major highlights of the work  
Hence the mixed culture RVM11.1 exhibited  good decolourization ability in the range of pH from 
6.5 to 8.5 and temperature from 25 to 40 ºC which are normal operational parameters for 
conventional wastewater treatment systems. Our culture offers obvious advantages, since oxygen 
can be easily deple ted under stationary conditions, thus creating conditions favourable for 
decolourization of azo dyes. The requirement of supplementary co -substrate by our bacterial 
consortium is quite low as compared to other reports and suggests its suitability for treat ment of 
dye-bearing wastewaters. RVM 11.1 could decolourize dyes much above the reported dye 
concentration in wastewaters, and thus could be successfully employed for treatment of dye -
bearing industrial wastewaters. Moreover it exhibited efficient decolour izing ability for 10 of the 
dyes tested. The ability of a culture to utilize cheap co -substrate such as starch for dye 
decolourization gives it an advantage for treatment of textile industry wastewaters. However the 
potential of the culture needs to be dem onstrated for its application in treatment of real dye -
bearing wastewaters using appropriate bioreactors.  
 
 
14.5.12 Isolation, characterization and decolorization of textile dyes by a mixed bacterial 
consortium JW -2 
 
(A) Results, summary and major outcomes  
Soil samples collected from dye contaminated sites of Jetpur, Gujarat were exploited for isolation 
of dye decolorizing organism. A microbial consortium JW -2 was selected based on its efficiency, 
showing maximum and faster decolorization of textile dyes. T he consortium consisted of three 
isolates. Identification of isolates by 16S rRNA technique revealed that the organisms were 
Paenibacillus polymyxa , Micrococcus luteus  and Micrococcus  sp. The concerted metabolic 
activity of these isolates led to complete d ecolorization of Reactive Violet 5R (100 ppm) within 
36 h whereas individual isolates could not show decolorization even on extended incubation. The 
culture exhibited good decolorization ability in the pH range from 6.5 to 8.5 and temperature 
from 25 to 37  ºC. The consortium showed complete decolorization utilizing low amount of Work of some Indian researchers  
  145cosubstrates like glucose (0.1 % w/v) and yeast extract (0.05 % w/v) and could also utilize a 
cheaper carbon source like starch in place of glucose as an alternative co -substrate. T he 
consortium had the ability to decolorize nine different dyes amongst 10 tested. Potential of this 
consortium JW -2 to decolorize textile effluent containing a mixture of textile dyes is to be carried 
out using appropriate bioreactors.  
 
(B) Major highligh ts of the work  
The consortium containing bacterial cultures P. polymyxa , M. luteus  and Micrococcus sp. 
exhibited good decolorization ability in a mixed form. These bacterial species have not been 
reported so far to our knowledge for dye decolorization. The  culture exhibited good 
decolorization ability at pH from 6.5 to 8.5 and temperature from 25 to 37 ºC, which are normal 
operation parameters for conventional wastewater treatment systems. The bacterial consortium 
was able to grow and decolorize dyes under static conditions. Agitated cultures, though exhibited 
good growth, showed poor decolorization. The mixed culture seems to have potential application 
in treatment of dye bearing wastewaters as it exhibited efficient decolorizing ability for nine out 
of 10 dyes tested. The ability of culture to utilize cheap co -substrate such as starch for dye 
decolorization gives it an advantage for treatment of textile industry wastewaters. However, 
potential of culture needs to be demonstrated for its application in treat ment of real dye bearing 
wastewaters using appropriate bioreactors.  
 
14.5.13 Response surface methodology for optimization of medium for decolorization of 
textile dye Direct Black 22 by a novel bacterial consortium  
 
(A) Results, summary and major outcomes  
Decolorization and degradation of polyazo dye Direct Black 22 was carried out by distillery spent 
wash degrading mixed bacterial consortium, DMC. Response surface methodology (RSM) 
involving a central composite design (CCD) in four factors was successfully  employed for the 
study and optimization of decolorization process. The hyper activities and interactions between 
glucose concentration, yeast extract concentration, dye concentration and inoculum size on dye 
decolorization were investigated and modeled. U nder optimized conditions the bacterial 
consortium was able to decolorize the dye almost completely (>91 %) within 12 h. Bacterial 
consortium was able to decolorize 10 different azo dyes. The optimum combination of the four 
variables predicted through RSM was confirmed through confirmatory experiments and hence 
this bacterial consortium holds potential for the treatment of industrial waste water. Dye 
degradation products obtained during the course of decolorization were analyzed by HPTLC.  
 
(B) Major highlig hts of the work  
Application of the mixed bacterial consortium DMC, comprising of P. aeroginosa  PAO1, S. 
maltophila  and P. mirabilis  to decolorization of textile dye Direct Black 22 seems to be a 
pragmatic approach. This study shows that response surface me thodology was an appropriate 
method to optimize the best culture conditions for obtaining maximum decolorization of the dye. 
The experimental and the predicted values were very close which reflected the accuracy and the 
applicability of RSM. By applying ce ntral composite design and RSM to the optimization 
experiments, we could investigate the process variables completely and achieve decolorization 
values up to 91 %. The culture not only decolorized the dye but it also degraded the dye which is Work of some Indian researchers  
  146seen in the H PTLC chromatogram. Moreover the ability of the consortium to decolorize 10 
different azo dyes with decolorization efficiency of more than 80 % with in 12 h indicates its 
potential application for decolorizing textile dyeing effluents.  
 
14.5.14 Decolorizati on of Ranocid Fast Blue Dye by bacterial consortium SV5  
 
(A) Results, summary and major outcomes  
Synthetic dyes are not uniformly susceptible to degradation in conventional wastewater treatment 
processes. A number of biotechnological processes have been su ggested as of potential interest in 
combating these pollutants in an ecofriendly manner. We determined the optimal parameters 
necessary for the bacterial consortium SV5 to decolorize Ranocid Fast Blue dye. The best results 
were obtained with a 0.1 % (w/v) concentration of both starch and yeast extract supplemented in 
Bushnell Hass Medium under static conditions at a temperature of 37°C in less than 24 h with an 
initial dye concentration of 100 ppm.  
 
(B) Major highlights of the work  
Our study demonstrates th at the bacterial consortium SV5 has a very efficient azo dye -
decolorizing capability. Studies of the identification and characterization of the bacterial 
consortium SV5 and the mode of action of decolorization of RFB by these microorganisms are 
under way.  
 
14.5.15 Community genomics: Isolation, characterization and expression of gene coding for 
azoreductase  
 
(A) Results, summary and major outcomes  
Soil collected from banks of the Khari -cut canal (Vatva, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India), 
contaminated by industrial  wastes, was used as inoculum for developing consortium enriched 
with dye degrading and/or tolerating bacteria. The consortium V9 was able to decolourize               
100 ppm of Reactive Violet 5 within 24 h at 37ºC. The amplified azoreductase gene had a length 
of 537 bp containing an ORF of 178 amino acids. BLASTn and BLASTx analyses showed 97 % 
and 98 % identity to sequences of azoreductase gene of Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Bacillus 
cereus G9241, respectively. The azoreductase gene was cloned in expres sion vectors and its in 
vitro activity was optimized. Co -factor NADPH.Na 4 (1 mM) was essential to obtain 85 -90 % dye 
degradation by cloned azoreductase gene. Escherichia coli  BL21(DE3) clone PET1 was able to 
degrade 90 % of dye within 7 min. Conversely, on ly 20 -30 % of total dye was degraded with cell 
extracts of control strains after 3 h.  
 
(B) Major highlights of the work  
The present study highlights the importance of consortium in bioremediation processes and will 
be of immense help in developing novel re combinant strains for application in dye contaminated 
waste -water treatments. Moreover, the present work also demonstrates that efficacious 
bioremediation strategies can be designed based on innate microbial community dynamics, 
structure and function. Micr obial communities are fundamental components of ecosystems 
capable of playing critical role in the metabolism and detoxification of anthropogenic/xenobiotic 
compounds.  Work of some Indian researchers

14.5.16 Decolorization of Synthetic Textile Dyes by Lignin Peroxidase of Phanerochaete 
chrysosporium  
 
(A) Results, summary and major outcomes  
Neem hull waste (containing a high amount of lignin and other phenolic compounds) was used 
for lignin peroxidase production by Phanerochaete chrysosporum under solid -state fermentation 
conditions. Maxi mum decolorization achieved by partially purified lignin peroxidase was 80 % 
for Porocion Brilliant Blue HGR, 83 for Ranocid Fast Blue, 70 for Acid Red 119 and 61 for 
Navidol Fast Black MSRL. The effects of different concentrations of veratryl alcohol, hyd rogen 
peroxide, enzyme and dye on the efficiency of decolorization have been investigated. Maximum 
decolorization efficiency was observed at 0.2 and 0.4 mmolL-1 hydrogen peroxide, 2.5 mmolL-1 
veratryl alcohol and pH 5.0 after a l h reaction, using 50 ppm o f dyes and 9.96 mkat/L of enzyme.  
 
14.5.17 Microaerophilic degradation of sulphonated azo dye - Reactive Red 195 by bacterial 
consortium AR1 through co -metabolism  
 
(A) Results, summary and major outcomes  
The textile and dye industries are considered as one  of the foremost sectors that pollutes 
environment. Technologies employing biological methods showed promising approach to 
remediate sites polluted with dye and dye intermediates. Bacterial consortium AR1 developed 
through culture enrichment method was com prised of four distinct bacterial strains. The 
synergistic metabolic activities of AR1 led to complete decolourization of monoazo dye Reactive 
Red 195 within 14 h under microaerophilic environment. The co -metabolic decolourization of 
Reactive Red 195 by co nsortium, in presence of maltose and proteose peptone (0.1 %, w/v, each) 
in minimal medium, easily reduced Reactive Red 195 (100 mgL-1) for five consecutive cycles 
without any replenishment of nutrient. The maximum decolourization was observed at pH 8.0 an d 
40 ºC. The consortium was acclimatized to decolourize Reactive Red 195 at higher concentration 
(2000 mg/L) even under high salt concentration (1 M NaCl). Consortium exhibited broad 
substrate specificity where it decolourized 15 structurally different dye s and more than 50% 
decolourization was observed in a medium containing mixture of dyes. The degradation products 
analyzed using FTIR, HPTLC and 1H NMR revealed the formation of 2 -amino -naphthalene,               
1-amino -benzene and 1 -nitrobenzene. Thus th e ability of bacterial consortium for simultaneous 
decolourization and degradation of azo compounds signifies its potential application in dye 
remediation.  
 
(B) Major highlights of the work  
The omnipresence and great adaptability of bacteria offers a simpl e and inexpensive green 
technology for remediating the environment contaminated with xenobiotic compounds of 
anthropogenic origin. Plenty of existing technologies are available for cleaning up the polluted 
environment; still promising and alternative strat egies are incessantly being developed. Thus, 
looking at the scenario, we have developed a potent consortium AR1 that reductively cleaved azo 
dye with simultaneous degradation of corresponding aromatic amines under ambient conditions 
without requirement of persistent nutrients. Consortium exhibited broad substrate specificity and 
capable of decolourizing azo dyes at higher concentrations. However, the detailed study is 
required to know the enzymatic and biochemical pathways involved during metabolism of azo Work of some Indian researchers  
  148dyes. Nevertheless this does not lessen the significance of the developed consortium for its 
applications in ex situ bioremediation.  
 
14.5.18  Synergistic action of flavin containing NADH dependant azoreductase and 
cytochrome P450 monooxygenase in azoaromat ic mineralization  
 
(A) Results, summary and major outcomes   
An alkaliphilic strain Bacillus lentus BI377 was isolated from contaminated soil of the textile area  
of Solapur, India. The strain was able to degrade almost 98% of recalcitrant azoic compounds by  
a mutually regulated process of azoreductase and a monooxygenase system. An enzyme activity 
study and a periodical carbon monoxide (CO) binding spectra study on a UV -visible 
spectrophotometer revealed that the intermediate amines formed by typical azoredu ction (NLN 
cleavage), subsequently underwent hydroxylation by the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase 
(CYP450) system. Azoreductase was purified by chromatographic techniques and 
characterization by MALDI -TOF substantiated its identity as FMN containing NADH dep endent 
azoreductase of 32 kDa in size. Surprisingly, purified azoreductase showed the highest activity at 
80 uC and pH 8.0. An increase in the activity of superoxide dismutase after decolorization 
confirmed the signature of oxidative stress and its involve ment in the dismutation of reactive 
metabolites. Intermediate metabolite analysis by HPLC, GC -MS and FTIR and the removal of 
total organic carbon (TOC) suggested the azoaromatics’ degradation leads to mineralization via a 
TCA cycle.  
 
(B) Major highlights o f the work  
The present study emphasizes the major utility of isolate B. lentus  BI377 for the bioremediation 
of hazardous recalcitrant azoaromatic compounds. The astonishing catabolic ability of the strain 
certainly provides unparalleled opportunities for u nderstanding the fundamental molecular 
mechanism of the degradation of organic compounds and their utilization as an energy source. 
The purified and characterized flavin containing alkaliphilic azoreductase provides rich 
opportunities to investigate the no nspecific diverse substrate specificity and mechanism of 
promiscuity among the family of flavoprotiens. This study opens up a dependable and efficient 
way to use B. lentus to accelerate the exploration of the feasibility of the bioremediation reactions 
over a wide range of temperature and pH. The symbiotic action of the enzyme azoreductase, 
cytochrome P450 monooxygenase and superoxide dismutase may provide a selective advantage 
to the degradation reaction under various conditions of environmental stress. Th erefore, this 
bacterial strain provides the potential enzymatic machinery to remove a wide variety of natural 
and man -made aromatic compounds discharged through geochemical cycles and urban and 
industrial activities as well as their subsequent transformati on into CO 2 and H 2O.

14.6.1 Selection of indicator bacteria based on screening of 16S rDNA metagenomic library 
from a two -stage anoxic –oxic bioreactor system degrading azo dye s 
 
(A) Results, summary and major outcomes  
Dye degradation has gained attention of late due to indiscriminate disposal from user industries. 
Enhancing efficiency of biological treatment provides a cheaper alternative vis -à-vis other 
advanced technologies. Dye molecules are metabolized biologically via anoxic and oxic 
treatments. In this study, bacterial community surviving on dye effluent working in anoxic –oxic 
bioreactor was analyzed using 16S rDNA approach. Azo -dye decolorizing and degrading 
bacterial com munity was enriched in lab -scale two -stage anoxic –oxic bioreactor. 16S rDNA 
metagenomic libraries of enriched population were constructed, screened and phylogenetically 
analyzed separately. Removal of ~35 % COD with complete decolorization was observed in 
anoxic bioreactor. Process was carried out by uncultured gamma proteobacterium constituting            
48 % of the total population and 12 % clones having homology to Klebsiella. Aromatic amines 
generated during partial treatment under anoxic bioreactor we re treated by aerobic population 
having 72 % unculturable unidentified bacterium and rest of the population consisting of         
Thauera  sp., Pseudoxanthomonas  sp., Desulfomicrobium  sp., Ottowia  sp., Acidovorax  sp., and 
Bacteriodetes  sp. 
 
(B) Major highli ghts of the work  
The study proposes the two -stage treatment of dye wastewater using anoxic and oxic bacterial 
consortia as biological key. Azo dyes were decolorized anoxically to produce aromatic amines 
which were toxic to E. coli ; and this effluent was fu rther detoxified in oxic bioreactor. Moreover, 
the study brings out the importance of knowledge of dye degrading microbial population. The 
16S rDNA data analysis indicated that Clostridium  sp., Klebsiella  sp. and Bacteroides  bacterium 
as typical indicator for anoxic reactor whereas the Ottowia  sp., Pseudoxanthomonas  sp. and 
Acidovorax  sp. indicator for oxic reactor in the case of dye degradation. Further studies are 
required to identify the role of defined members of microbial population.

14.7.1 Genotoxicity of Degradation Products of Textile Dyes Evaluated with rec-Assay After 
PhotoFenton and Ligninase Treatment  
 
Fourteen textile dyes (from azo, anthraquinone, heterocyclic, oxazine, methine/polymethine a nd 
triphenylmethane groups) were decolourized and degraded using Photo -fenton treatment (PFT) 
and Phanerochaete chrysosporium  crude ligninase enzyme (ED) treatment approach. The 
genotoxicity of the dyes and their degradation products were assayed using rec-assay method. We 
found that the genotoxicity was depended on the dye and on the method of degradation. In 
general, PFT was better than ED in decreasing the genotoxicity. Basic dyes showed complete or 
maximum loss of genotoxicity, whereas the vat group was  more resistant. The azo group showed 
varied results. Crystal Violet was the only dye whose genotoxicity increased after PFT. Our 
results suggest that PFT and ED are two effective treatment methods to reduce the genotoxicity of 
dyes in waste waters.  Work of some Indian researchers

14.7.2 Biodegradation of textile azo -dyes by Phanerochaete chrysosporium  
Eighteen commercially obtained textile dyes was used in the study. Amongst the 18 dyes, eight 
dyes were degraded in the range of 40 to 73 % by the white rot fungus, Phanerochaete 
chrysosp orium . The study suggested that dye removal of diazo dye Reactofix Gold Yellow by 
Phanerochaete chrysosporium  was achieved by lignin -degrading enzyme system Degradation 
was best achieved by adding the dye to the medium and then inoculating with pre -grown 
mycelium. Inoculation with fungal spores resulted was mainly resulted in dye adsorption.  
 
14.7.3 Use of Phanerochaete chrysosporium  biomass for the removal of textile dyes from a 
synthetic effluent  
 
The use of Phanerochaete chrysosporium biomass for the rem oval of Reactofix Golden Yellow 
from aqueous solution and eight textile dyes (four azo and four anthraquinone) from a synthetic 
effluent (0.6 gL-1) at different pH, temperature and biomass concentrations was studied. 
Adsorption was maximum at pH 2.0 and 40 ºC using 2.45 g mycelial biomass. The rate constant of 
adsorption was 1.95 x 10-1min-1 for Reactofix Golden Yellow and 1.64 x 10-1min-1 for synthetic 
effluent. In both cases, the equilibrium data fitted well in the Langmuir but not the Freundlich 
model of adsorption, and the adsorption was biphasic. Adsorption decreased the COD of 
Reactofix Golden Yellow and synthetic effluent by 54 and 57 %, respectively. Desorption                     
(80–84 %) of dyes from P. chrysosporium mycelial surface occurred as the  pH increased from 2 
to 10.  
 
14.8 Research outcomes from Dr. Harvinder Singh Saini ’s Lab 
Dr. Saini’s work mainly involves evaluating the metabolic potential of the cultures in 
immobilized cell bioreactors to transform the dye to non -toxic central metabolic  intermediates, 
which could be further mineralized. For this different configurations of the bioreactors viz, 
upflow immobilized cell reactors (UICR ranging from 10 ml to 100 ml working volumes), plug 
flow reactor (PFR, upto 100 L working volume) and conti nuously stirred aerobic reactor (CSAR, 
upto 10 L working volume) were desigened and used. The small volume UICR had been used to 
carry out extensive studies with different effluents, both simulated and actual effluents, to 
optimize the operating parameters  so as to achieve desired levels of clean up. The efficiency of 
treatment was validated by analytical techniques and by genotoxic studies using mouse model.  
Their future prospect is to apply the efficient cultures either in the equalization tanks of the 
industries or to treat spent dye bath liquor, after appropriate dilution, to achieve desired levels of  
clean up. The spent dye bath liquor needs dilution as in some dyeing process the organic load (in 
terms of COD) is higher, resulting in toxic shock to the microbial populations.

  15215.1 Opening Remarks  
Till the mid -late part of last centaury (1960 -70s) water has not been considered as non -
renewable resources and economic cost of water was not taken into consideration when cost of 
industrial activities was counted. Its essence as a natural resource required for saving the basic 
entity of life was distinctly realized in the last decade of 20th centaury. The hard earn lesson have 
taught us, to  minimize water consumption, minimize the contamination load while returning it 
back to environment, because it has limited self -purification ability.     
Dye, dye intermediates, pigment manufacturing and textile industries form the backbone of the 
industr ial and agricultural development in the country. They provide building blocks for 
downstream industries. The inevitable part of any industrial process is generation of wastewater 
and in the mist of development we have neglected the impact on environment, w hich have 
directly and indirectly affected the basic essence of life.        
Soon we have realized the negative consequence of industrial development and have started the 
remediation process. An ample amount of research globally as well as in sub -continent  has been 
directed towards development of efficient (bio)remediation technology. However, spending 
billions of rupees and efforts of several decades, the hunt for integrative and universal technology  
is still on and vast gap exists between lab research and  its successful on -filed application. 
Therefore, there is an urgent need for an integrated perspective for effective bioremediation 
technology i.e. integrating the knowledge of geobiologist, biochemical engineer, microbiologist, 
biotechnologist and statist ician for predicting and analyzing the technology outcome. Thus, to 
assess the status of the research carried out on bioremediation (and biodegradation of dyes and 
dye intermediates) in the country the compendium was buildup.  
 
Before we put any opinion or  any recommendations, some peculiar observations needed to be 
looked upon, to reach any decisive conclusion.    
 
15.2 Primary Observations  
Currently in the country, with reference to available scientific literature, on the biological front , 
researchers are  effectively working on bio -decolurization (of dye and other intermediates) and 
bio-degradation using microbial sources and plant system in association with rhizospheric 
bacteria.  
Moreover, upon analyzing the projects supported by Department of Biotechnol ogy, Ministry of 
Science and Technology, New Delhi, and other national funding agencies (and which were 
recorded as ‘Successfully Completed’) certain peculiar features in  Objectives of the Projects are 
highlighted below.  
• Many of the projects were inclined towards isolation and screening of novel microorganisms 
capable to degrading various dyes and raw textile effluents: so as to account for a first time 
reported strains .       
• Apprehensive need for standardization of nutritional requirement and other media conditions: 
because dye compounds are poor source of carbon and energy .   
• Obligatory optimization of environmental factors (under laboratory conditions): so as to 
mimic the real environmental situation and to access the competence of the isolated strains .    Suggestions and recommendations  
  153• Orderly description of degradation profile and identification of degraded intermediates of test 
dye compound using different analytical methods: so as to demonstrate the degradative 
potential of the isolated strains .   
• Supportive studies on toxicity, ma jority of them are through seed germination of 
agriculturally important crops: so as to demonstrate the superlative ability of the isolated 
stains .       
• Need for studying enzymes involved in decolourization and degradation of dye compounds: 
so as to prove  the biological role of decolourization and degradation .    
• Immobilization of microbial strains or enzymes in different matrix: so as to prevent direct 
damage to the enzymes and to reuse the entrapped microbes/enzymes to reduce the financial 
burden of trea tment .   
• Validation of flask level results at lab scale (bio)reactors and direct study on bioreactors either 
with simulated effluents or real textile effluents   
• In a very few instances investigators wanted to demonstrate or to apply the lab driven 
technol ogy at large scale for real on -site field applications  
 
Microbial sources primarily and most widely used are Bacteria followed by Fungus and Algae 
and very few types of Yeast. They are used either as pure cultures or in mixed form in various 
mutual associa tions of different microbes. It was observed that in certain studies immobilizing the 
whole microbial cells through entrapment or attachment was performed. The entrapment would 
provide fibrous or porous materials for easy transfusion of dye compound into t he matrix. The 
immobilization step proposed to provide more resilient to the cells from environmental 
perturbation such as pH, other toxic chemicals, etc., in comparison to suspended cells in the 
medium. The work is also actively being conducted on dye dec olourization and degradation 
through microbial enzymes either directly from microbes or using various preparation of 
commercial source. Like immobilization of microbial cells, enzymes are also immobilized to 
prolong their activity and half -life.  
Majority of the studies were performed under laboratory conditions and at small scale (very few 
were successfully demonstrated at pilot scale with single industrial effluent). By citing the reason  
of environmental conditions, bulk of resources and good amount of ti me are spend on optimizing 
the very known abiotic and biotic factors, which generally have less significance in open 
environment under natural conditions. Removal of colour from waste water should not be sole 
aim for such treatment process. Recently the st udy has been diverted towards complete 
mineralization of dye molecules besides removing the colour portion of the effluents.  
 
 There were more than 500 Ph.Ds were produced in last three decades, majority of these 
studies were focused on isolation and charac terization of microbial strains, optimization of 
abiotic and biotic parameters, studying the probable degradation pathway of single model dye 
compound using analytical techniques like UV -vis spectroscopy, HPLC, HPTLC, GC -MS/LC -
MS, NMR, etc., few toxicity s tudies at Flask scale under laboratory conditions using either 
pure strains of mixed cultures.  
 Since the work in the publications is reflection of Ph.D thesis of the researcher, by studying 
the publications in form of research articles of Indian authors, m ostly it was found to be a 
routine work with isolation characterization and few optimization studies along with pathway 
predictions and primitive toxicity studies are reported.  
 Few studies have been directed towards studying simulated or real textile/dye i ndustrial 
effluents at reactor levels.  
 More applicable research (or the technologies developed) on remediation of dye and textile 
effluent is being carried out at ETPs and CETPs rather than at University laboratories.  Suggestions and recommendations  
  154 Actual filed scale applications are ve ry rare from the studies originated at University level.   
 Recently in last five years few research works, directly emphasising on demonstrating the 
effective methodology for large scale treatment are coming up.  
 It is a matter of fact and we need to becom e more realistic on accepting our limitations for 
incapable of producing more viable and universally accepted technology. The application and 
concept of bioremediation are wobbling since last three decades in our country. But, with the 
complexity of the ef fluents and our own restrains (and the point of views are more academic 
rather that on technology development) we are still searching blindly for a possible solution.  
 There are different standards set for regulation of release of industrial waste / by -products 
directly into open environment depending upon the nature of xenobiotic compounds and their 
effect on biosphere. For instance, for dye containing waste water effluents discharge standards 
are being set by taking into consideration of the fact that huma n eye can detect colour at the 
level of 1 ppm also.  
 There are isolated case studies showing effective technological excellence for remediation of 
waste effluent, but post success it was either not adopted to national level or the developed 
methodologies ar e specific for the local region.   
 For the treatment of textile effluent, very rare studies (viz. Prof. S. P. Govindwar’s lab, under 
University set up) study where recently they are focusing on phytoremediation at field level, 
majority of the studies in th e country is very preliminary showing most efficient results under 
laboratory conditions. Because many of them have not experimented or have not excelled at 
larger scale or at filed trails, the studies had become more of mere publications oriented or to 
scale academic heights.  
 The limitations of all the available technologies and the failures to translate the lab scale 
results at field levels may be attributed to one or more of following:  
o certain technologies may not be able to function (as antiicapted) du e to unpredictable and 
non-anticipated complexities at field level  
o due to chronic pollution, some of essential components of ecosystem and ecological 
process might have already been damaged irreversibly  
o bioaugmentation and acclimatization may fail as adde d organism/s might not be able to 
compete and survive with indigenous flora   
o the level of pollution and the complexities of the effluents is too high to be treatment with 
available technology  
 
15.3 Recommendation to Department of Biotechnology, Ministry o f Science and 
Technology, New Delhi  
 
15.3.1 Major Opinions  
1.  Foremost, we need to understand and recognize that textile effluent is highly heterogeneous 
because the composition of the effluent is usually a subject to daily, seasonal and/or market 
demand  depending on the current fashion trends of the country. And which makes it 
extremely difficult for any technology of either physical or chemical or physico -chemical or 
biological origin or integrated of all three types or any hybrid technology to provide absolute 
treatment efficiency. Therefore, textile effluent based on its characteristic composition must 
be segregated into similar/dissimilar origin and the emphasis should be on developing the 
individual technology for particular group of effluents.            
2.  The current practices at few CETPs across the country of combining of treated textile/dye 
containing effluents along with treated sewage water or high scale dilution of treated effluent 
may not be sufficient. With the scale of industrial effluent s being treated and released daily, 
there could be two possible locations for treatment of dye containing effluents.  Suggestions and recommendations  
  155 (i) at the manufacturing or dye application industry itself: treated water may be 
partially or completely reused for indigenous consumptio ns  
(ii) at sewage treatment plant: after primary/secondary treatment, where indigenous 
ongoing biological/chemical treatment method should be applied as a final 
polishing step  
 3.  Today in the country more than 500 ETPs, CETPs and STPs are in operating c onditions. 
Extensive and substantial knowledge has been generated over past two decades on the 
problems relating to efficiency and effectiveness of these treatment plants, for treatment of 
waste water and its reuse. The technical and scientific information  should be used for 
enhancing the functional efficiency of presently operating ETPs, CETPs and STPs through 
modifications, additions or deletions of treatment steps. Alternatively, any novel, simple and 
cost effective technologies that are adaptive to loca l conditions should be evolved at higher 
level.  
4.  The initial success of phytoremediation (which was evident from the couple of projects being 
supported by Department of Biotechnology) may be extrapolated by linking CETPs and 
STPs with constructed wetla nds. The constructed wetlands should be developed in a way that 
they are locally adaptive.  
 5.  It is well known that more than 70 % of the textile and dye manufacturing industries in the 
country are segmented into un -organized sectors comprising of Small and Medium Scale 
Enterprises (SMEs). To impose the individual wastewater treatment plant in these industries, 
it would add a financial burden on the units. However, such industries are one of the major 
sources of the pollution.  
 In certain industrial esta tes the SEMs do have the waste water treatment facilities, but they 
are rudimentary. Therefore, government should provide financial assistance to such units for 
setting up of primary and/or secondary treatment plants or need to devise an incentive based 
policies to promote the treatment facilities in such industries.    
 6.  Today we have adequate information and basic understanding about the microbial 
behavioural pattern and their requirements in terms of carbon sources and environmental 
parameters, at fla sk level and lab scale reactor level (including few local successes studies). 
Department of Biotechnology (as well as other national funding agencies) may immediately 
cease any future support to the research projects which are of routine nature (as describ ed in 
Chapter 07, Project Type I).  
 DBT may focus on the research projects which demonstrate the direct application and ready 
to take challenge to provide treatability solution at industry level for multiple remediation 
cycle. The project should involve s cientific expertise from academic institute, technical 
expertise either from CETPs or similar organization and an industrial partner where actual 
application has to be performed.  
7.  Because as noted in Chapter 03, there are several stages for the process ing of textile and at 
the end of each steps, waste water are generated. The compositions of these waste waters 
considerably differ at each step which required different treatment approaches. It would be 
more easy to develop technology which would be more t arget oriented. Therefore, 
possibilities should be explored to establish the treatment system for different stages of 
wastewaters (especially for steps which are generating wastewater with more contaminants) 
in the individual textile units.     
8.  Moreove r, the research projects which have shown the potential success for treating the 
effluents at large scale (e.g. Project No. 3, Chapter No. 07) are either not adopted at large Suggestions and recommendations  
  156scale or in other region of the country. Department of Biotechnology should to ta ke enough 
care that such kind of projects is further extrapolated at national level.    
9.  One of the problems of using microbial technologies in treatment of waste water for reuse is 
how to immobilize microbial consortium/mixed cultures used in the treat ment of industrial 
effluents and sewage? For long -term retention of microbes in the system, it is necessary to 
evolve a technology that enables microbes to remain in the rhizoplane / rhizosphere of plants 
used in the constructed wetlands.  
10. For construct ion of wetlands or any phyto -remediation technology requires land. 
Government intervention is therefore required for implementation of large scale treatment 
scheme.  
11. Another prominent observations made was the absolute absence of commercial Patents in 
dye and textile effluents treatment technologies in the country. The lack of quality Patents 
clearly describes the current state of research in this area.  
    
15.3.2 Minor Opinions  
1.  Looking at the state of research at laboratory level and limited succe ss of various CETPs 
across the country it is inevitable to develop an alternative industrial scale set -up excessively 
for dye manufacturing and/or for textile industries to achieve the set standards of discharge 
limits of dye containing effluents.  
2.  As a premier funding agency, the Department of Biotechnology, New Delhi may recommend 
the Central Pollution Control Board and State Pollution Control Boards that polluters must 
take responsibilities for cleaning of atleast streams and small tributaries and sho uld discharge 
clean water by treating effluents at the source as per Polluter pay Principle. For a certain 
Medium Scale Enterprises and Large Scale Textile and Dye manufacturing industries as their 
responsibilities, they should support R&D for development and implementation of advanced 
cost effective technologies for wastewater treatment.   
3.   After having substantial knowledge and adequate experimental trials at lab scale, pilot level, 
ETPs and CETP plants and at individual units, Department of Biotechno logy should integrate 
the expertise available in the country from all sphere of science and technology with a 
common aim to be able to demonstrate the remediation of any one selective polluted tributary 
/ stream / rivulet / river in a defined time frame.    
4. Department of Biotechnology, New Delhi may promote entrepreneurship among young 
scientists/postgraduates or scheme on Start -up Grants may be provided for the development 
and implementation of next generation integrative bioremediation technologies for  treatment 
of textile industrial effluents and its possible reuse in industry  
 
15.4 Additional suggestions and recommendations  
Besides to above suggestions and recommendations to DBT, few additional suggestions were 
congregated to other national funding a gencies, regulatory bodies, textile industries.   
 
15.4.1  Recommendations and suggestions  to other funding agencies  
 Today we have adequate information and basic understanding about the microbial behavioural 
pattern and their requirements in terms of carbon  sources and environmental parameters, at 
flask level and lab scale reactor level (including few local successes studies). All Scientific 
and Technical Research Funding Agencies (including state funding agencies) may Suggestions and recommendations  
  157immediately cease any future support to  the research projects which are of routine nature (as 
described in Chapter 07, Project Type I).  
 
 It has been observed that many of the research work from different funding agencies were of 
repetitive in nature and non -overlapping. There should be continut ity in the research and 
overlapping with the aim and objectives.  
 Moreover, the scientific and technical studies for developing a common technology for 
treatment of dye manufacturing and textile effluents (in our country) have been highly 
fragmented (and u sually of shorter duration). Many of them are oriented towards achieving 
academic milestones rather than providing effective solution to the problem.  
 It has to be more targeted and if needed the research projects should be extended to longer 
durations (7 -15 years). There should be a ‘mission’ and a coordinated, synchronized timely 
and highly focused work needed to be funded in a more organized manner.  
 They may focus on the research projects which demonstrate the direct application and ready to 
take challen ge to provide treatability solution at industry level for multiple remediation cycle.  
 The individual centric research projects have provided very limited solution. Focus should be 
involving (a) industrial partner, mainly from Small scale units and a resea rch groups with 
established scientific and technical experience in the area; (b) CETPs and a research groups    
 
15.4.2  Recommendations and suggestions to regulatory bodies   
 
(A) State Regulatory Bodies (SRBs)  
  It is of no doubt that all SRBs  are performin g their duties in right directions. But they need to 
follow their mandate religiously.  
  Foremost they need to persue the state government to activate the closed -down STPs and any 
ETPs (if any).  
  SRBs  strictly needs to prevent ‘Diffusion Pollution’ particu larly for groundwater  
  SRBs  must focus and devise a ‘Comprehensive Rain Water Conservation Policy’ for all 
textile units (need to implement both for new and existing units)  
  SRBs  on regular basis need to sensitize the owners about the environmental concer ns and 
required to be need encouraged for implementation of any type of treatment technology at the 
industry itself    
  The textile industries in particular are clustered together in specified zones (as Small/Medium 
Scale Industries), across all the states  in our country. SRBs  need to create database (has to 
make it mandatory) to collect the right information about the raw materials and chemicals 
used from each units from time to time. This will immensely help to develop the 
treatment/technologies.    
  SRBs  may encourage the each unit to switch towards the ‘cleaner productions’, water less 
production of their products   
 SRBs  must take initiative and request the industrial units to participate, cooperate and must 
coordinate the scientific and technical work l eading to establishment of treatment technology 
suited best for their effluent.    
 
(B) Central Regulatory Bodies (CRBs)  
 There exists a frame works of rules, regulations and legislation in the country for the release 
and disposal of industrial liquid waste  in the environment. But the implementing agencies 
have isolated and limited success.  Suggestions and recommendations  
  158 Different region of the country are following different standards, viz. the state of Tamil Nadu 
are following the Zero Discharge Policy, while in state of Gujarat treate d effluents with 
defined release norms are either mixed with treated wastewater from local domestic 
wastewater treatment plants or are released into oceans. Therefore, with a matter of further 
deliberation, additionally there is an immediate need to devise  a uniform national policy for 
discharge and release treated wastewater throughout the country.  
 Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) has shown promising results in the countries like USA, Spain, 
China. Even in India as noted above Tamil Nadu are following ZLD prac tise, especially for 
Textile effluent. CRBs  may consider in phase manner to adopt the ZLD practises across the 
country.  
 CRBs  need to devise “Integrated Concepts for Water Reuse” for water intensive industries.  
 CRBs  may meticulously adopt the policy of ‘Po lluters pay Principle’ atleast for Large Scale 
Mills and few Medium Scale Units. They must take responsibilities for cleaning of should 
discharge clean water by treating effluents at the source.  
 CRBs  must take initiative and request the industrial units to  participate, cooperate and must 
coordinate the scientific and technical work leading to establishment of treatment technology 
suited best for their effluent.    
 CRBs need to devise “Water Reuse Policy” particularly for textile and finishing industries.  
 
15.4.3  Recommendations and suggestions to textile industries   
Environmental planning is no more considered as a luxury, but a base stone for a sustainable and 
developmental planning. Therefore, before commencement of any new industrial setups, a study 
of en vironmental impacts must be included as a part of feasibility studies.     
It is the time to move towards “Water Efficient India”. Need of the hour is to recycle and reuse 
water. Inspite of its great potential and accumulated evidence, reuse of water in ma ny of the 
textile industry is still an uncommon practise.   
(A) Large Scale Textile Mills  
 Foremost, Large Scale industrial setups which are in forms of mills, needs to establish their 
In-house  wastewater treatment facility, since they have enough freedom a t monetary front. 
Many of them might having the treatmeant facility, but require upgradation according to the 
current need.  
 Many of them may directly support couple of research projects to academic or research 
institutes.   
 They need to develop the strate gy to for recycling and reuse of water    
 
(B) Small and Medium Scale Textiles Units  
 Most importantly, they need to become more proactive and required to show their consent 
and offer their space to willing research groups. Because quantity of pollution ca used by 
SMEs is far larger than large scale units, they need to coordinate and collaborate in the 
mission, without aggressively depending on government initiatives and CETPs.   
 They need to develop the strategy to for recycling and reuse of water       
 
15.4.4  Recommendations to researchers  with list of thrust areas of R&D aspects which needs to 
be taken up  
 
 Currently we have ample amount of treatment methods and technology, which have shown 
their potential for the treatment industrial effluent at differe nt stages of technology 
development.  Suggestions and recommendations  
  159 After couple of decades of intense research, the merits and demerits of each treatment 
methods are well know. The scope of each technology is well understood. And we have 
recognized that we need to reset our approaches .   
 Research community need to shed the perception of academic oriented study, especially for 
industrial effluent research.  
 Primary focus should to develop treatment technology directly for raw effluent from dye and 
dye intermediates manufacturing industr ies and textile and finishing industries, rather than 
working on individual dyes and/or simulated effluents under conditions.  
 Large number of laboratory scale studies has shown that, the combination of two or more 
methods has worked better, then the imple mentation of single method. Thus, integrated 
approach based work should be given priority.       
  
For next decade, research must be focused in Phase -wise orderly manner, without being over 
ambitious (and spending time and money with repetitive type of nev er ending research)   
     
Thrust Areas Development of Integrated Technologies,  
  
 Phase – I (3-5 years ) 
 So as to observe the repetitive effect and potentiality of developed technology on 
different production cycles and to counter the seasonal effect on imp lementing 
technology  
 Technology should be targeted for a single dye and dye intermediates manufacturing 
and textile and finishing units  
 Because, once point source pollution decrease, it would be easy to treat the effluents 
at CETP or effluents from diffe rent industrial source simultaneously   
 
 Phase –II (4– 6 years )  
 Target should be on cluster of units producing similar type of effluents   
 
 Phase – III (5-8 years )   
 Target should be on devising treatment technology for effluent collected at treatment 
facilities (i.e. ETPs, CETPs, etc.)

History of Dyes  
 
2600 BC   The earliest written record of the use of colouring substance 
(dyestuffs) was found from China, from as early as 2600 BC.  
715 BC   Around 715 BC Wool dyeing was an established craft in Rome.  
331 BC   After conquering Susa (capital of Persia) Alexander finds 190 
year old purple robes.   
327 BC   Alexander mentions “bea utiful printed cottons” in India.  
236 BC   An Egyptian Papyrus mentions dyers as “stinking of fish”, with 
tired eyes and hands working unceasingly.  
55 BC   Romans found painted people “picti” in Gaul dyeing themselves 
with Woad (same chemical content of co lor as indigo).  
2nd and 3rd 
Centuries AD   Roman graves found with madder and indigo dyed textiles, 
replacing the old Imperial Purple (purpura).  
3rd Centuary  Papyrus found in a grave contains the oldest dye recipe known, 
for imitation purple called “Stoc kholm Papyrus”. It is a Greek 
work.  
273 AD   Emperor Aurelian refused to let his wife buy a purpura dyed silk 
garment. It cost its weight in gold.  
Late 4th 
Centuary  Emperor Theodosium of Byzantium issued a decree forbidding 
the use of certain shades of pu rple except by the Imperial family 
on pain of death.  
400 AD   Murex  (the mollusk from which purpura comes) becoming scarce 
due to huge demand and over harvesting for Romans. One pound 
of cloth dyed with Murex worth $20,000 in terms of our money 
today (Empe ror Augustus source).  
700's   Chinese manuscript mentions dyeing with wax resist technique 
(batik)  
925  ‘The Wool Dyers’ Guilds first initiated in Germany.  
1188   The first mention of Guilds for Dyers in London.  
1197   King John (of Magna Carta fame) pers uaded parliament to 
regulate dyeing of woolens to protect the public from poor 
quality goods.  
1200' s  Rucellia, of Florence, rediscovered the ancient art of making 
purple dye from lichens sent from Asia Minor (similar to 
Orchils).  
1212   The city of Flore nce had over 200 dyers, fullers and tailors. A 
directory of weavers and spinners was published as well.  
1290   The only blue dye of the period, Woad, began to be raised 
extensively in Germany. The 3 major dyes were now: woad, 
madder and weld.  
1321   Brazil wood was first mentioned as a dye, source from East Indies 
and India.  Appendices  
  2051327 -1377  Edward III, “Royal Wool Merchant” offered protection to all 
foreigners living in England and to all who wanted to come to 
help improve the textile industry.  
Early 15th 
Centu ary  Cennino Cennini of Padua, Italy described the printing of cloth 
(block printing) in his treatise called ‘Method of Painting Cloths 
by Means of Moulds’.  
15th Centuary  Aztecs under Montezuma conquered the Mayans. 11 Mayan 
cities paid a yearly tribute o f 2000 decorated cotton blankets and 
40 bags of Cochineal (insect dye) each.  
1429   The 1st European book on dyeing ‘Mariegola Dell'Arte de 
Tentori’ was published in Italy.  
1464   Pope Paul II introduced the so called “Cardinals' Purple” which 
was really s carlet from the Kermes insect. This became the first 
luxury dye of the Middle Ages just as Imperial Purple (Murex) 
had been for the ancient world.  
1472   Edward IV incorporated the Dyers' Company of London.  
1507   In Europe, Germany, Holland and France beg in the cultivation of 
dye plants (as an industry).  
1519   Pizarro and Cortez find that there is cotton in Central and South 
America. They send back brightly printed fabrics showing that 
the Indians knew about block printing prior to the Conquest. 
Cochineal  from Mexico and Peru now being shipped back to 
Spain.  
1614  Dyeing cloth “in the wood” was introduced in England: logwood, 
fustic, etc.  
1630   Drebbel, a Dutch chemist, produced a new brilliant red dye from 
cochineal and tin. It was used at Goblein (Pari s) and the Bow 
Dyeworks (England).  
1631 -33 The East India Company began importation of calico from 
Calicut, India to England; at first they thought the fabric was 
linen, not cotton.  
Mid-1600 's English Logwood cutters in Honduras lead a dangerous life 
(danger from Spaniards, hurricanes, swamps, disease) in the Bay 
of Campeachy, but could get very rich.  
1688   James II, of England, prohibited exportation of un -dyed cloth 
from England to help bolster the home industry for English dyers 
over that of the Scott ish dyers.  
1689   The first calico printworks was begun in Germany at Augsburg 
and was later to grow into a large industry.  
18th Centuary   English dyehouse gets contract to dye the Buckingham Palace 
Guards coats with cochineal, this contract continued int o the 20th 
Centuary still using cochineal.  
1708   William III, signed a law prohibiting the importation of printed 
silks, this only made calicos and silks more popular.  Appendices  
  2061716   There were now more than 30 laws in England prohibiting the 
importation of calic o and cotton; prints became more popular 
than ever.  
1727  A method of bleaching linen with kelp (seaweed) was introduced 
in Scotland.  
1745   Indigo begins to be grown in England, after the Revolution when 
it became cheaper to import from the East Indies.  
1766   Dr. Cuthbert Gordon patents Cudbear (derived from his mother's 
name) Cuthbert was prepared from a variety of lichens. Only one 
of 2 natural dyes ever credited to an individual (other is 
quercitron  to Bancroft).  
1769   Arkwright's spinning frame in E ngland (aka the Spinning Jenny ) 
1774   Swedish chemist, Scheele, discovered chlorine destroyed 
vegetable colors by observing a cork in a bottle of hydrochloric 
acid.  
1774   Prussian Blue and Sulphuric acid available commercially. 
Prussian blue formed from prussite of potash and iron salt 
(copperas). Actually one of the early chemical dyes.  
1775   Bancroft introduced the use of quercitron bark as a natural dye. 
One of only 2 natural dyes whose discoverer is known, it yields a 
yellow, brighter than fustic, an d is from the inner bark of 
American oak.  
1786   Bertholet, France, recommended chlorine water for commercial 
bleaching. Other oxidizing agents began to be used, viz.  
hydrogen peroxide, sodium peroxide and sodium perborate.  
1785   Bell, England, who had i nvented printing from plates, developed 
roller printing  
1788  Picric acid available (yellow dye and disinfectant) could be dyed 
from acid dyebath on wool  
1790   Acid discharge of mordant printing developed.  
1794   Three Frenchmen set up first calico print ing. 
1796   Tennant developed bleaching process.  
1797   Bancroft develops a process for steam fixation of prints.  
1798   Oberkampf (in Jouy, France) pleased Napoleon by showing him 
a roller printer made from a cannon Napoleon had seized from 
the Pope. This  began the famous ‘Toiles de Jouy’ production.  
1802   Sir Robert Peel brought out a resist method; he had purchased the 
idea for from a commercial traveller for equivalent of $25. It 
consisted of a wax or other resist on the background, actually a 
batik te chnique done on large scale.  
1823   Mercer discovered chromate discharge of indigo.  
1825   Mathias Baldwin began the first American production of 
engraved metal rollers for calico printing which were used in the 
Philadelphia area and could produce 300 yard s of fabric per day.  Appendices  
  2071834   Runge, a German chemist, noticed that upon distilling coal tar, 
aniline would give a bright blue color if treated with bleaching 
powder. This helped to pave the way to the development of 
aniline (basic) dyes 22 years later.  
1844  The process was called “mercerization”. John Mercer discovered 
that treating cotton with caustic soda (lye) while under tension 
improved its strength, luster, dyeability, absorbency.  
1856   William Henry Perkin discovered the first synthetic dye stuff  
“Mauve” (aniline, a basic dye) while searching for a cure for 
malaria and a new industry was begun. It was a brilliant fuchsia 
type color, but faded easily so our idea of the color mauve is not 
what the appearance of the original color was.  
1858   Griess d iscovered diazotisation and coupling on/in the fiber.  
1858 -59 Magenta (fuchsin) discovered by Verguin the 2nd basic dye and 
more widely used than Mauve.  
1861   Methyl violet, basic dye developed by Lauth.  
1862   Hofmann's Violet, developed by Hofmann, was  one of the great 
dye chemists of all time.  
1862   Bismarck Brown developed by Martius and Lightfoot, first 
soluble azo dye.  
1863   Aniline Black, developed by Lightfoot, a black produced by 
oxidation of aniline on the cotton fiber.  
1866   Methyl Violet, b asic dye was developed.  
1868  Graebe and Liebermann, German chemists, produced alizarin 
(synthetic madder). This was the first time a synthetic substitute 
for a vegetable dye had been manufactured. W. H. Perkin also 
synthesized it about the same time, bu t independently.  
1872   Methyl Green, the basic dye was developed by Lauth and 
Baubigny, still in use.  
1873   Cachou de Laval, 1st sulphur dye, a brown, by Groissant and 
Bretonniere, France.  
1875 -76 Caro and Witt prepared Chrysoidine, 1st important membe r of 
azo class of dye.  
1876   Caro, an important dye chemist, discovered Methyl Blue.  
1877   Malachite Green, basic dye developed by Dobner and Fisher.  
1878   Biebrich Scarlet invented, a very pure red acid dye, rivalling 
cochineal in brightness.  
1878  von Baeyer synthesized synthetic indigo. It was not marketed 
until 1897.  
1880   Thomas and Holliday, England, synthesized the first azo dye 
formed on the fabric by coupling. Vacanceine red formed by 
treating fabric with napthol and then dipping in a diazoliz ed 
amine, a very fast category of dyes.  Appendices  
  2081884   Congo Red by Bottiger, first of the direct cotton dyes.  
1885  Benzopurpurine, early direct dye by Duisberg, bright and highly 
substantive.  
1885   Para Red dye brought out by von Gallois and Ullrich. (β -napthol 
and nitraniline).  
1885 -89 Chardonnet, France, made the first successful rayon and showed 
it at the Paris Exposition of 1889.  
1887   Alizarin Yellow GG (1st azo mordant dye) and Rhodamine B 
(brilliant red violet, basic dye) was synthesized.  
1890   Direct Black BH, first direct black dye was developed.  
1891   Diamine Green B, first green azo dye was introduced.  
1891   Chardonnet built his first commercial plant at Besancon for 
manufacturing ra yon, by the Chardonnet process.  
1891   Sky Blue FF (a direct dye) with good light fastness was first 
synthesized and for many years was used as blue colour dye.  
1893  Vidal Black (2nd sulphur dye) was synthesized.  
1895  Viscose method of making rayon inv ented by Cross and Bevan, 
England was begun. This is now the most common process for 
manufacture of rayon.  
1898   Direct Black E, a black dye of major importance was first 
synthesized.  
1900  When Mozaffer ed Din became Shah of Persia one of his first 
edicts was to prohibit the use of analine dyes for rugs. All analine 
dyes were seized and publicly burned. Penalties included jail and 
fines equal to double the value of the merchandise.  
1901   Rene Bohn patented his invention of Indanthrene Blue RS, the 
first anthraquinone vat dye, a category of dyes with extremely 
good fastness to light and washing.  
1901   Bohn developed 2nd vat dye, Flanthrene a yellow  
1902   Thesmar, Baumann, Descamps, and Frossard brought out 
hydrosulfite and sulfoxylateformaldehyde.  
1905  Thio indigo Red, by Freidlander, 1st indigoid dye was developed.  
1908  Hydron Blue, a rival to indigo, developed by Cassella.  
1914   USA importing 90 % of its dye stuffs, a problem during WWI, as 
many came from Germany.  
1915  Neolan dye, 1st metalliz ed chrome dye, dyed from strong acid 
bath.  
1921   Bader developed soluble vat colors, the Indigosols.  
1922   The AATCC (American Association of Textile Chemists and 
Colorists) formed its first subcommittee to study washfastness of 
printed and dyed cottons,  formulate testing procedures, standards 
of fastness.  Appendices  
  2091924   Indigosol -0 devloped by Baeyer and Sunder, 1st commercial 
indigosol dye.  
1928   Dupont began the fundamental research that would lead to 
discovery of nylon.  
1936   First pair of stockings knit wi th a new synthetic fiber from 
DuPont called “nylon” for which Carothers received the patent.

1957   CIBA introduces Cibacrons, a new range of reactive dyes and the 
first to compete with ICI's Procion series.  
1958   Eastman Kodak introduced Kodel polyester.  
1964   First permanent press fi nishes used.  
1968   DuPont introduces Qiana, a fancy nylon with “silk” feel and 
drape.  
1968   For the first time manmade fibers topped natural fibers for US 
consumption. 5 billion pounds vs 4.6 billion pounds, the use of 
polyester was growing the most quic kly.

Full Text:     This invention relates to a process for treating dyes wastewater.  
 
Prior Art  
The activated sludge is the most common b iological method for treating dye wastewaters, in 
which the reduction of BOD (90%) and COD (40 -507) was comparatively higher than the 
colouring matter (10 -30%, Oil is et. al. 1991. Li and Zhams 1996 and Ahmed and Oil is 1984). 
The reduction in colouring ma tter in the activated sludge process has been ascribed, primarily due 
to its adsorption on the sludge, suggesting a little degradation of dyes during the treatment proces s 
(Srimuli and Karthikeyan 1999). Now a day, there is a greater emphasis on the isolat ion of a 
noble microorganism capable of degrading a variety of dye/s. A large number of bacterial species 
capable of degrading azo compounds are Proteus  spp., Enterococcus  spp., Streptococcus  spp., 
Bacillus subtilis  (Zissi et. al., 1997), Closteridium  spp., Pseudomonas  spp. (Bumpus, 1995), 
Klebsiella pneumonia  and Acetobacter liquefaciens  (So et. al., 1990, Wang & Yuen 1996), 
Streptomyces  spp. (Pasti et. al., 1991), Sphingomonas  spp. (Kudhch et. al. 1997), Trametes 
versicolur , Bjerkandera  adust (Heinfling e t. al. 1997). Azo dyes do not degrade readily in 
presence of oxygen (Johnson et. al. 1978), whereas in the anaerobic conditions, these are reduced 
to colourless, toxic and carcinogenic amines (Zimmerman el. al. 1982).  
Only recently azo dyes have been repor ted to degrade aerobically (Bumpus 1995, Heinfling et.al. 
1997, Pasti et al. 1995, Zissi et al. 1997), F'sedomonas  sp. K -l (Wong Yuen 1996), Psedomonas  
S-42 (Bumpus 1995), Acetobacter liquefaciens  (So et. al 1990) and Klebsiella pneumonia  RS-13 
(Wong & Yue n 1996) are the bacterial species which co -metabolically degrade the dyes in 
aerobic condition.  
 
Object of the Invention  
An object of this invention is to propose to process for treating dyes wastewater such as azo dyes, 
aniline dye and reactive dyes aero bically under the identical conditions. Another object of this 
invention is to propose to process for treating dyes wastewater which is cheap and requiring very 
little inputs.  
 
Description of the Invention  
According to this invention there is provided a pr ocess for treating dye wastewater comprising if, 
a. primary step of chemical treatment as herein described followed by secondary and tertiary steps 
of biological treatment as herein described performed in bioreactors followed by the step of 
polishing as he rein described in and a wetland for treating the dyes under aerobic conditions. 
Important findings, which are reported for the first time for the treatment of azo dyes, are Appendices  
  221described below. The acidic azo wastewaters having a pH 2 -4 are first neutralized u sing lime. 
This decreased their COD (20 -70%), conductivity (40 -70"n) and Cu (20 -60%) as a result of 
precipitation of dissolved matters. This neutral wastewater is then fed continuously for example in 
24 h into two serially arranged fixed film upflow biorea ctors. The bioreactors consisted of biofilm 
of consortium of aerobic microbes (from Institute of Microbial Technology, chandigarh, Report 
of which is enclosed) developed on the surface of grits. The aerobic conditions in the bioreactor 
are maintained by co ntinuous aeration, using an aquarium pump in the reactor. Microbially 
treated water is then passed through a constructed wetland haing Phragmites and Typha at a 
loading rate of for example 15 cm/day. The wetland has down flow pattern of hydraulic loading. 
The retention period of the wastewater in the bioreactors and constructed wetland is for example 
two days only, one day each in the bioreactors and constructed wetland. The reduction in COD 
levels as well as its load after treatment of azo dye waslewater’s  at successive steps in the 
bioreactors and constructed wetlands. During spectroscopic studies marked reduction in the size 
of peaks in the UV region after passing of dye wastewater through bioreactors and constructed 
wetland were found. The chromatographi c studies revealed absence of dyes in the treated 
wastewater, which were present in the untreated wastewater. The GC mass studies also confirmed 
degradation of azo dyes during the treatment process, 36 peaks detected in the neutral azo 
wastewater decreased  to 22 after treatment during winter, when micorbial activities are slow on 
account of low temperature.  
The toxicity of treated wastewater was constantly monitored during study period, growing 
Gambusia fishes in a 15 L bucket having submerged plants like H ydrilla and Ceratophyllum. The 
fishes grow and breed normally during more than six months of the study, establishing the fact 
that treated water is non toxic and can be safely discharged into the water courses. It was found 
that treated wastewater can be r ecycled back in the same industry. The treated wastewater also 
had no adverse effect on the growth of Cymopsis plants. These had well developed root nodules 
similar to control plants which were unhealthy and few in number in the plants growing in dye 
waste water irrigated soils. The degradation of dissolved methyl red dye (50 ppm) was also 
studied in the system during summer. The optical density of methyl red decreased after treatment 
in the system, also noted a marked reduction in size of peaks in both UV V isible range.  
The GC mass studies of methyl red solution in methanol detected 64 peaks including that one of 
the solvent. The number of compounds decreased to two in the outflow after microbial treatments 
in the bioreactors and constructed wetland, affirm ing degradation methyl red in the treatment 
system. Thus we have achieved significant degradation of dyes at two days retention period. 
Further sludge production is minimum in our system. We have also studied degradation of methyl 
red by both pure culture of two different bacterial isolates from our system and also using their 
consortium. The complete decolorisation of methy red was achieved within 24 hours after 
inoculation of both pure isolates of bacteria as well s their mixed consortium. The treatment o f 
dye wastewater released in the silicate process was also studied. The silicate process uses reactive  
dyes for printing, which are fixed in the concentrated solution of sodium silicate. We have 
developed method for the removal of sodium silicate in the dy e wastewater, thereafter, the 
wastewater was inoculated with both pure isolates as well contort turn of the microbes. The 
complete decolourisation of the wastewater was achieved within 48 hours, being relatively faster 
in the contortium in comparison to th e purt isolates, which establishes that the process system can 
treat a variety of dye wastewaters.

effluents in the agricultural soil by bio -electrokinetics  
 
Abstract  
Textile dye contaminated agricultural soil contains large amount of organic and inorga nic 
impurities. The present invention relates to the development of bio -electrokinetic process for the 
removal of pollutants from the soil. Starch with aromatic degrading bacteria Pseudomonas spp 
and cellulose degrading bacteria {Bacillus cereus and both c ellulose and laccase positive Bacillus 
subtilus, and Bacillus tequilensis) were used as anolyte, which move towards cathode, via 
electroosmosis process in electrokinetic technique. The reduction of COD was in the range of 
70% to 82%. The inorganic impuriti es of chloride, sulphate and trace metal ions were removed by 
electromigration process. Significant reduction of conductivity and TDS can be achieved by bio -
electrokinetic process. The injection of starch with bacteria and removal of pollutants improve the  
fertility of the agricultural soil.  
 
(d) Title: Processes for decolorization of colored effluents  
 
Abstract  
The present invention relates to a novel process for decolorization of colored effluents. More 
particularly it relates to a process for decolori zation of colored effluents of textile mills, dye -
making industries, paper and pulp industries and molasses spent wash from alcohol distilleries 
using an unidentified white -rot marine fungus NIOCC #2a isolated from mangrove wood and 
deposited on Sep. 7, 20 04 in the microbial type culture collection (MTCC) of the Institute of 
Microbial Technology, Chandigarh, India, under the accession number MTCC 5159. Further, this 
invention relates to decolorization of these effluents using the fungus directly, its cell -free culture 
supernatant or immobilized fungus or extracellular polymeric substances produced by the fungus. 
Furthermore, the decolorization of effluents can be carried out from 30ºC to 60ºC and at pH 3 to 
6. The decolorization of various colored effluents occurs in the presence of sea water with 25 
parts per thousand salinity. Several synthetic dyes are also decolorized under similar conditions of  
temperature and pH by using free mycelia or immobilized fungus or extracellular culture fluids or 
extracellular  polymeric substances.
