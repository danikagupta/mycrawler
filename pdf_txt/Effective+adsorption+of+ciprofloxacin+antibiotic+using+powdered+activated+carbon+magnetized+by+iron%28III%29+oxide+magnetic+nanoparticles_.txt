Abstract  
Contamination of water by ciprofloxacin has become a significant concern due to its adverse 
health effects and growing  evidence  of antimicrobial -resistant genes evolution. To this end, a 
chemically modified bamboo biochar was prepared from bamboo sawdust to effectively 
remove ciprofloxacin (CIP) from an aqueous solution . Under similar adsorption conditions, 
the modified bamboo bio char (MBC) has an excellent CIP removal efficiency ( 96%) 
compared to unmodified bamboo biochar (UBC) efficiency (4 5%). Thus, MBC was used in 
batch adsorption experiments  and the process was optimized with the central composite 
design (CCD) framework of response surface methodology (RSM). Sorption process 
parameters such as initial CIP concentration, pH, adsorbent dose , and contact time were 
studied and found to have a sign ificant effect on CIP removal . The optim al CIP removal 
(96%)  was obtained at  MBC dose (0.5  g L-1), CIP initial concentration (20 mg  L-1), pH (7.5) , 
and contact time (46 min). The adsorption kinetic data were well described by the pseudo -
second -order model (R2 = 0.999) , and both Langmuir (R2 = 0.994) and Freundlich (R2 = 
0.972) models  gave the best fit in CIP adsorption isotherm analysis.  The maximum 
monolayer adsorption c apacity of the MBC was 78.43  mg g-1 based on the Langmuir isotherm 
model . These results suggest that CIP adsorption was mainly controlled by chemisorption. 
Moreover, the CIP adsorption process was endothermic and spontaneous. Overall , MBC is a 
low-cost, efficient , and recyclable  adsorbent for eliminating  emerging contaminants such as 
cipro floxacin from an aqueous solution.  Keywords:  Adsorption; Ciproflox acin; bamboo  biochar; chemical activation, Optimization  
1. Introduction  
 Emerging water contaminants such as pharmaceuticals have recently gained 
considerable research attention (Balarak  et al.,  2021) . Among pharmaceuticals, antibiotics are 
the most widely consumed pharmaceutical drugs  (Azizi, 2020)  that pollut e water bodies . 
There are different classes of antibiotics based on their mechanism of action, chemical 
structure, action spectrum , and route of administration (Ilurdoz et al., 2022) . The  most 
common classification of antibiotics is based on their mode of action, which includes 
fluoroquinolones, quinolones, β -lactams, sulfonamides, monobactams,  carbapenems, and 
aminoglycosides . Quinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, norfloxacin , and oflo xacin) are 
broad -spectrum antibiotics that are widely prescribed (Ilurdoz et al., 2022) . More 
importantly, CIP stands in the first place  based on the number of antibiotics prescribed in this 
group  (Movasaghi et al., 2019) . Ciprofloxacin (CIP), a second -generation fluoroquinolone  
antibiotic , was developed by a German businessman in 1983. It has a fluorine atom  at 
position 6 in the quinol one group to target most gram -negative and some gram -positive 
bacteria (Falyouna et al., 2022) . CIP prevents the replication of bacteria and ultimately 
inhibits their proliferation (Adaobi et al., 2021) . Due to its wide consumption as a broad -
spectrum drug  (Ilurdoz et al., 2022) , incomplete metabolism (15-20%)  in humans and animals  
(Movasaghi et al., 2019 ; Laurent et al., 2000) , higher  environmental concentration  (up to 
20,321 ng  L-1)  and frequent detection  in the environment (Ilurdoz et al., 2022) (Movasaghi et 
al., 2019 ; J. Li et al., 2018) . CIP has become one of the top priority water contaminants that 
need s research intervention. It has been released into the environment and detected in 
groundwater, surface water , and wastewater treatment plant effluents (Yousefi et al., 2021) . 
Antibiotic pollution of ecosystems can pose serious health ri sks to human s due to their high 
toxicity and carcinogenic properties (Abu Rumman et al., 2021) . Contamination of drinking 
water supplies with CIP, in particular, can result in serious health effects such as 
thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, eosinophilia, elevation of liver enzymes, and 
leucopenia (Balarak & Mckay, 2021) . Albeit  low concentration , CIP can promote  and 
accelerate the growth of antimicrobial -resistant (AMRs)  genes  in water (Falyouna et al., 
2022) . Therefore, the removal of CIP from an aqueous environment has become an urgent 
issue (Li et al., 2018) . 
    Conventional wastewater treatment methods are unable to sufficiently remove CIP 
from water, owing to CIP's biodegradation resistance (Ghadiri et al., 2020; Liang et al., 
2018) . In response  to this problem , removal mechanisms such as ozonation (Bilal et al., 
2021) , catalytic oxidation (Nemati et al., 2019) , photocatalytic degradation  of CIP with 
hematite (Fe 2O3) nanoparticles (Rajiv et al., 2021) , electro -Fenton (Mi et al., 2018) , 
electrocoagulation (Mohammed et al., 2021) , magnetic nanomaterials (Chang et al., 2021)  
reverse osmosis (Río-gamero et al., 2018) , solar photo -oxidation (Tawfik et al., 2022)  and 
adsorption (Liang et al., 2018 ; Río-gamero et al., 2018 ; Ezekoye et al., 2020)  have been 
explored for the  remov al of CIP from  water. Among the advanced oxidation processes 
mentioned above, solar photo -oxidation is recently considered  a promising way of degrading 
recalcitrant pollutants in industrial wastewater. Solar energy based water treatment processes 
are regarded as a sustainable way of pollutants remediation with promis ing potential  (Tawfik 
et al., 2022) . Recently, photocatalyti c degradation  has been employed for the removal of 
recalcitrant water contaminants such as norfloxacin  (Kumar et al., 2019) , ampicillin (Sharma 
et al., 2018) , and methylene blue dye  (Sadiq et al., 2021)  and showed promis ing efficiency . 
However, most of the treatment  methods cited above have the issue of  efficiency , high energy 
requirement, generation of toxic by -products, and high treatment cost (Al et al., 2021 ; 
Balarak et al., 2021) . Therefore, efficient and low-cost treatment options that do not introduce 
harmful by -products are required to eliminate antibiotics from water (Balarak  et al.,  2021) . In 
this regar d,  adsorption is a promising method that achieves these noted benefits , plus it can 
be implemented without difficulty  (Kaya et al., 2021; Ji et al., 2021 ; Wan and Li, 2019 ; Al et 
al., 2021) .  
 Various adsorbents such as montmorillonite (Wu et al., 2010) , clinoptilolite (Ngeno et 
al., 2019) , metal -organic framework (Gadipelly et al., 2018) , graphene hydrogel (Yu et al., 
2019 ), activated bentonite (Maged, 2020) , iron oxide nanoparticle (Lin and Lee, 2020) , 
titanate nanotubes (Ji et al., 2021) , silica -xerogels (Kaya et al., 2021) , nanocomposite 
(Elessawy et al., 2020) , chitosan (Nazraz et al., 2019)  and biochar (Luo et al., 2019 ; Li et al., 
2018 ; Huang et al., 2018)  have been applied for CIP removal. Magnetic nanoparticles such as 
magnetic core -shell MnFe 2O4@TiO 2 nanoparticl es (Chang et al., 2021) , humic acid , and 
levulinic acid -coated Fe 3O4 nanoparticles are efficient in removing CIP from water 
(Mahmoud et al., 2021) . Other non -magnetic nanoparticles such as graphene oxide 
nanoparticles were  also reported to be efficient for the removal of antidiabetic pharmaceutical 
(metformin) from an aqueous solution  (Balasubramani et al., 2020) . However, most of these adsorbents are associated with complicated preparation techniques, sustainability problems, 
low CIP uptake (Ezekoy e et al., 2020), availability, and higher preparation cost. Despite the 
promising potential of n anoadsorbents , issues related to separation challenge s from aqueous 
solution s and the associated secondary pollution limited their large -scale applications. As a 
result , the quest for more cost -effective and efficient adsorbent s is ongoing (Ezekoye et al., 
2020). Among the adsorbents proposed for CIP removal, biochar  has several advantages 
because of its sustainability, low -cost, feedstock availability  and easy separation  from 
aqueous solution  (Zheng et al., 2021) . On the other hand, transforming low  value biomass 
waste material into value -added materials such as biochar is an example of promoting the 
circular economy (Osman et al., 2019) .  
 The type and availability of functional groups on the surface of biochar play a critical 
role in removing pollutants (Kazemi et al., 2020) . The high surface area, high mineral 
content , and sufficient oxygen -containing groups of biochar tend to favor  the adsorption of 
water contaminants (Zheng et al., 2021) . Most importantly, chemical modification techniques 
can easil y improve the surface of the biochar.  Osman et al. (2020)  reported  surface area s of 
1368 m2 g and 1142 m2 g after one step (H 3PO 4) and two steps (H 3PO 4 + KOH) chemical 
activation of he rbace ous lignocellulosic biomass with a surface area of 17 m2 g before 
activation.  
 The adsorptive capacity of the biochar can be  enhanced by employing different 
methods  such as chemical modification, physical modification, impregnating with mineral 
sorbents , and magnetic modification. These modifications can alter the physico -chemical  and 
surface  nature of biochars. Compared with physical modification, chemical activation 
enhances the surface area due to the sh orter activation time and lower activation energy of 
functionalized porous carbons in  the presence of an alkaline activation agent (Zheng et al., 
2021) . Generally, chemical modification of biochar is done via the addition of acids or bases 
to alter the surface functional properties of the biochar before or after carbonation. Acid 
activation results in surface acidities and modification of the porous structure of biochar. 
More often,   phosphoric (H 3PO 4), sulphuric (H 2SO 4), nitric (HNO 3), and hydrochloric  (HCl) 
acids (Rajapaksha et al., 2019)  are used for acid activation , which yielded improved 
adsorption capacity . Biochar modified by H 2SO 4, KOH and methanol  has shown enhanced 
tetracycline (TC) removal through π - π EDA interactions because of the functional groups on 
its surface (Rajapaksha et al., 2019) . Alternatively , impregnation with FeCl 3, Fe 2O3, Fe (NO 3)3, and MgCl 2 is performed by soaking biochars or their feedstock in metal nitrates or 
chlorides solution  (Rajapaksha et al., 2019) .  
 Adsorbent preparation using iron salts has the advantages of inducing magnetic 
properties to the adsorbent for easy separation and enhancing the sorption capacity of the 
adsorbent by providing additional sorption sites for the removal of the contaminants  (Chen et 
al., 2011 ; Zhao et al.,  2018 ; Chen et al., 2019 ; Reguyal et al., 2016) . It has been reported that 
magnetic biochar has demonstrated higher sorption capability for organic pollutants removal 
compared to non -magnetic biochar (Chen et al., 2011) . The higher adsorptive capacity of a 
magnetic sorbent is probably due to the involvement of Fe -O in the adsorption process  (Lim 
et al., 2009) . On the other hand, the alkaline modification of biochar may change the 
biochar's physical/chemical properties (surface area, pore size, types of functional groups) . Li 
et al.  (2017)  reported that the KOH treated biochar possessed more mesopores than the raw 
biochar  and showed higher adsorptive performance than the raw biochar (Li et al., 2 017). 
Until now, amine -functionalized bamboo biochar (Peng et al., 2018) , bamboo biochar 
modified with H 3PO 4 and K 2CO 3 (Wang et al., 2015) , co-pyroly zed bamboo and sewage 
sludge  char (Li et al., 2020a)  have been investigated for CIP adsorption. However, most of 
these modification processes involve multi -step process es for biochar preparation.  As a 
result, a simple protocol for produ cing biochar with a high adsorptive capacity can provide a 
viable alternative for CIP removal  from water.   To the best of our knowledge,  simultaneous 
treatment of bamboo sawdust with FeCl 3 and KOH for CIP removal from water has not been 
reported yet.   
 Bamboo is a plentiful and fast -growing renewable woody plant used in construction 
and furniture applications. During the technological processing of bamboo for various 
applications, a considerable amount of bamboo sawdust  is generated. Also, i t is reported that 
bamboo waste (BW) has high organic matter content (Li et al., 2020) . Due to its low -cost and 
availability, this study considered bamboo sawdust for CIP adsorbent preparation . This study 
investigated the potential of modified bamboo biochar for CIP removal  from aqueous 
solutions  using batch adsorption experiments . The CIP adsorption process parameters such as 
initial CIP concentration, pH, contact time , and adsorbent dosage were optimized employing 
response surface methodology (CCD experimental design). Adsorption kinetics, isotherm , 
and thermodynamic studies were conducted to describe the removal mechanism and nature of 
CIP adsorption with modified bamboo biochar. Furthermore, adsorbent re use and recycle test 
was conducted for five consecutive CIP adsorption -desorption cycles.  2. Materials and methods  
2.1. Chemical and materials  
 The bamboo sawdust was collected from the local areas where bamboo is process ed 
for furniture applications. All other chemicals (FeCl 3.6H 2O, KOH, HCl, NaOH , and NaCl) 
used in this study were purchased from Rankem chemical supplier, Ethiopia. The analytical 
standard for ciprofloxacin hydrochloride  (CIP) with purity  >99.7% was obtained from Cadila 
Pharmaceuticals Ltd in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. All chemicals used in this study were 
analytical grade and used without further purification .  
2.2. Adsorbent preparation  
 The collected bamboo  sawdust  was washed to remove any dirt  bound to the biomass 
and dried overnight at 120ºC. Afterward, it was grounded to a particle size less than 850μm. 
Bamboo sawdust was chemically modified with ferric chloride and potassium hydroxide a t 
the same time, employing a 5:1  w/w ratio of bamboo saw dust to FeCl 3.6H 2O and a 1:5 w/v 
ratio of bamboo sawdust to KOH (1M). The chemical modification was carried out at 80ºC 
and 600  rpm for  2 hrs. The mixture was  then dried at 60ºC in a vacuum oven for 24 hrs. The 
dried and chemically treated bamboo sawdust was grounded to a particle size of less than  
450μm before being  carbonized at 70 0ºC for 1 hr at a  heating  ramp rate of 10ºC/min in an 
oxygen -limited carbolite furnace . The carbonized bamboo (bamboo  biochar) was then 
washed with ultrapure water until the filtrate pH bec ame 7 and dried at 120ºC overnight to 
get modified bamboo biochar (MBC). The MBC was then grounded to a particle size less 
than 150 μm and stored in air-tight polyethylene bags for further use.  Moreover, unmodified 
bamboo biochar (UBC), bamboo treated solely  with ferric chloride (FMBC) , and bamboo 
treated with only potassium hydroxide (KMBC) were also prepared  via a similar synthesis 
route to investigate the effect of chemical modification and individual chemical 
modification s. 
2.3. Adsorbent  characterization  
 The structure and crystal phase of the modified (MBC) and unmodified bamboo 
biochar (UBC) were analyzed by conducting the x-ray diffraction analysis ( XRD; Rigaku 
MiniFlex 600 Benchtop ). In XRD analysis, Cu Kα radiation was applied to generate x-rays at 
1.54441 Å wavelength employing the following operational conditions: 40 kV and 15  mA, 
and a ngle sca nning (2θ) rang ing from 10° to 6 0°. Moreover, t he presence of functional groups was identified by Spectrum 65 PerkinElmer -FTIR in the range of 4000 -400 cm-1 
(resolution: 4cm-1, no of scans : 16) using KBr pellets. In addition, the specific surface area s 
of the biochar s were  analyzed with nitrogen adsorption -desorption at 77 °K using SA-9600 
Series Surface Area Analyzer ( Horiba Instruments, Inc. ). The sampl es were degassed at 
100° C for 2 h before  analysis . The s pecific surface area was deter mined by the multi -point 
BET method in the N2 relative pres sure (P/P 0) range of 0.05 –0.30.  
2.3.1. Determination of pHpzc  
 The point of zero charge (pH pzc) is one of the vital material characterization 
parameter s that describes the net surface charge of adsorbents as a function of solution pH 
(Al et al., 2021 ; Khodadadi et al., 2019) . The p oint of zero charge (pHpzc) of MBC was 
conducted according to the method used in previous studies  (Khodadadi et al., 2019 ; Peña et 
al., 2012 ; Al et al., 2021) . In this study, pHpzc was determined using eight Erlenmeye r flasks 
filled with 50 ml CIP solution (20 mg  L-1). Initially , the  pH values of the solutions were 
adjusted to 2–11 using 0.1 M HCl and 0.1M N aOH.  Following that , 0.1 g of the MBC  was 
added to each flask and shaken at 200 rpm for 24h. The final pH values of the solutions were 
then measured. The variation s between final and initial pH values were  recorded (y -axis) and 
plotted against the initial pH  values  (x-axis). The initial pH value at which y -axis = 0 denotes 
the point of zero charge  (pH pzc) value.  
2.4. Adsorption  experiment s 
 A preliminary batch adsorption study was undertaken to investigate the CIP removal 
efficiencies of UBC, MBC , FMBC , and KMBC . Based on the preliminary study, MBC 
showed superior performance on CIP removal and was  chosen for further adsorption study. 
Batch adsorption experi ments were conducted in a water bath  shaker  under controlled 
temperature and shaking speed. A stock solution of ciprofloxacin hydrochloride monohydrate 
(1 g L-1) was prepared by dissolving 1000 mg of ciprofloxacin in one litre ultrapure water. 
The adsorption equilibrium time was determin ed at pH =7.0, CIP initial concentration of 20  
mg L-1, and adsorbent dosage of 0.5  g L-1 considering contact time of 10, 30, 50,  70, 90, 110 , 
and 130 minutes . To obtain an optimal operational condition, a dsorption process parameters 
such as C IP initial concentration (5 –50 mg L-1), pH = 2-12, contact time (5 –60 min) , and 
adsorbents dose (0.25 –1.25 g L-1) were studied. These parameter ranges were selected based 
on adsorption experiments (equilibrium study, point of zero charge s, and preliminary test) as 
well as commonly reported operational conditions  for CIP removal  in the literature . The pH of the CIP solution was adjusted using 0.1M HCl and 0.1M NaOH. All adsorption studies 
were carried out in a 100 ml conical flask using a water shaker bath at 200 rpm and 25ºC. The 
temperature was varied from 25 to 45ºC for the thermodynamic study. Before CIP anal ysis, 
the adsorption solution was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes and filtered through a 
0.45μm syringe filter.  Adsorption experiments of  kinetics, isotherms, and thermodynamics  
were carried out in triplicate . Eqs.(1) and (2) were used to compute C IP removal efficiency 
and adsorption capacity, respectively (Falyouna et al., 2022) .

2.5. Ciprofloxacin analysis  
 Ciprofloxacin concentration was analyzed  using a spectrophotometer  (UV1610, 
China)  at 274.8 nm. The calibration curve was plotted using seven standard ciprofloxacin 
solutions: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 mg L-1, as well as a blank.  The obtained standard 
calibration  (R2 = 0.998 ) curve is expressed in Eq . (3).

where, Y is CIP concentration (mg L-1), and X is the UV –vis spectrophotometer absorbance 
reading of the solution at 274.8 nm wavelength.  
2.6. Adsorbent regeneration  
 Adsorbent reusability is one of the most important economic parameters of the 
adsorption systems in water and wastewater treatment  applications (Abu Rumman et al., 
2021) . Therefore, in this study, the re usability  of MBC  was examined for five consecutive 
CIP adsorption -desorption cycles at an optimal operating conditions ( pH = 7 .5; CIP 
concentration = 20  mg L-1; MBC dose = 0.5g L-1, time = 120 min, shaking speed = 200 rpm and temperature = 25ºC ) obtained in previous steps . CIP desorption optimization experiments 
were co nducted using 0.3M NaOH, 0.3M HCl, methano l, and 3% NaOH  + methanol  to get 
the best desorbing solution for the CIP.  These solutions were employed in previous studies as 
eluents for CIP desorption  from various adsorbents . The MBC reusability test was then 
conducted using the best desorbing  solution . After each cycle, MBC  was thoroughly washed 
with ultrapure water, filtered and dried up in an oven, and then reused  in the next adsorption 
cycle. The adsorption efficiency of MBC after each cycle was calculated  using  Eq. (1 ). 
2.7. Design of experiments using a central composite design  
 Central composite design (CCD) is one of the frameworks of response surface 
methodology (RSM)  often employed to statistically analyze experimental data . Design expert 
software (Trial version: 11.0) was used to evaluate all parameters and experimental data. In 
this approach, responses are affected by various process variables. Main process variables 
such as pH , adsorbent dose, contact time , and CIP concentration were combined to give 30 
experiments  for CIP removal from an aqueous solution . An e quilibrium time study and 
determination of the point of zero charge s of MBC were  conducted before  developing the 
CCD experimental design. Thus, the selection of levels of pH and contact time  was based on 
the data obtained from these studies and the review of previous studies. Levels of other 
parameters such as initial CIP concentration and adsorbent dose were based on the CIP 
adsorption preliminary study and commonly reported values in previous studies. Table 1 
shows the independent variable ranges and their coded values. CIP has pKa values of 6.1and 
8.7. In this regard, t he pH values of l ow (5.25), central (7.5) , and high (9.75) were selected to 
include the pH level less than 6.1, greater than  8.7, and 6.1 - 8.7. Low contact time  (18.75 
min) and high (46.25 min) were selected after conducting the equilibrium time study. Contact 
time values below the equilibrium time (70 min) were selected to analyze the effect of 
contact time  on CIP adsorption . The relationship between the coded and real (un -coded) 
values is presented in Eq. (4) (Asghar et al., 2019a) .

In this regard , RSM was used to derive a quadratic polynomial model for expressing the 
effects of the independent variables on the response. The quadratic equation of the o ptimal

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to statistically assess the potential of the 
developed polynomial model in predicting the experimental results . 
2.8. Adsorption  kinetic study  
 The time profile data of CIP adsorption onto the modified biochar were analyzed 
using four kinetic models commonly used in solid -liquid adsorption processes: the pseudo -
first-order equation, the pseudo -second -order equation , Elovi ch, and intra –particle kinetic 
models as written in Eqs. (6 -9), respectively (Soares et al., 2019) . Adsorption kinetics was 
studied using the optimum parameters obtained in the RSM optimization step.

2.9. Adsorption isotherm study  
 The adsorption performance  of the CIP isotherm model is essential  for investigating 
the interactions between CIP and biochar (MBC) during the adsorption process (Balarak  et 
al., 2021) . This study considered four isotherm models : Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin and 
Dubinin –Radushkevich (D –R) to evaluate the equilibrium CIP adsorption isotherm data 
expressed in  Eq. (10-13), respectively.  The isotherm study was conducted using  optimum 
operating condition s obtained from the CCD experimental design.

 The thermodynamic study was conducted using 25, 35 , and 45ºC  at a shaking speed 
of 200 rpm . Optimum CIP adsorption conditions obtained in the CCD design were employed 
to conduct the thermodynamic study. There are three essential parameters for thermodynamic  
study, namely, Gibbs free energy change (ΔGo), enthalpy change (ΔGo), and entropy change 
(ΔGo). Gibbs free energy change (ΔGo) can be evaluated by applying Van't Hoff equation .   
 
where, T, R, and K o are absolute temperature (K), universal gas constant (8.314 J K-1 mol-1), 
and thermodynamic constant (dimensionless), respectively.  The third principle in 
thermodynamics emphasizes the relationship between ΔGo and the other two parameters in 
Eq. (1 7).

3. Results and  discussion  
3.1. Characterization of b iochar  
3.1.1. FTIR a nalysis  
 The FTIR spectra of unmodified biochar (UMC), modified biochar (MBC), modified 
biochar after CIP adsorption (MBC -CIP) and CIP are presented in Fig. 1. In MBC, new peaks 
appeared at 3543 – 3456 cm-1 (broad peak), 2918 – 2835cm-1, 2250 – 2000, and 1052 cm-1, 
which were assigned to the stretching vibrations of –OH (hydroxyl or carboxyl groups (Peng 
et al., 2018) , C-H (asymmetrically and symmetrically stretching vibrations of aliphatic), C≡O  
(alkyne) and C -O (carboxylic acid and esters), respectively. The dehydration of biochar 
(chemically treated) sample during the carbonation process res ulted in the O -H vibration 
stretching of water molecules (Al et al., 2021). Additionally, the new peak emerged in MBC 
at 540 cm−1 shows Fe -O-Fe stretching vibration, indicating that iron oxide was successfully 
supported on the biochar surface (Ma et al., 2022 ; Al et al., 2021) . Thus, the FTIR spectra 
result showed that the surface of MBC contained rich oxygen -containing groups and aroma tic 
structures, which provided favorable conditions for CIP adsorption.  
 After CIP adsorption onto MBC (CIP -MBC), as shown in Fig 1, the peaks observed 
in MBC at 3500, 2872, and 1052 cm-1 were shifted to 3407, 2917, and 1018 cm-1, 
respectively. On the oth er hand, the peaks observed at 2188 and 540 disappeared after 
adsorption. Moreover, the new narrow peak (2920 cm-1) that appeared on MBC -CIP is 
similar to the peak observed in CIP (2920 cm-1). The intensity of the peak observed in MBC 
after adsorption (MBC  – CIP) at 3400 cm-1 is similar to the intensity of the peak at 3500 in 
CIP. Hence, it is evident that the –OH, C -H, C -O, C≡O, and Fe -O groups observed on MBC 
were involved in the CIP adsorption process. The presence of several functional groups on the sur face of MBC played an important role in CIP removal from aqueous solution via 
electrostatic interactions, complexation reaction, π -π EDA interactions, and hydrogen 
bonding (Rajapaksha et a l., 2019) .

after adsorption (MBC - CIP) , and ciprofloxacin (CIP)  
3.1.2. BET  surface area 
 The BET surface area of MBC (1158.050 m2 g-1) was remarkably  higher than that of 
UBC (565.095 m2 g-1). This result indicated that simultaneous activation of bamboo sawdust 
with ferric chloride and potassium hydroxide enhanced the surface area of the biochar 
significantly . The  increase in surface area may be attributed to the formation of new pores 
and the opening of initially inaccessible pores during the chemical activation process, which 
would help develop a more porous structure (Peng et al., 2018) . The surface area is an 
important parameter that plays a significant role in physical adsorption. The h igher surface 
area of the material leads to higher adsorption of the pollutant due to the availability of many  
adsorption sites for more organic pollutant removal (Peng et al., 2018) . Accordingly, MBC is 
expected to have higher removal of CIP molecules from aqueous solutions  than the UBC .  
3.1.3. XRD  
 The X -ray powder diffraction (XRD) ( XRD; Rigaku MiniFlex 600 Benchtop ) was 
conducted  to investigate the crystalline compositions of the bamboo biochars. The XRD 
analysis result is shown in Fig. 2.  The peaks at 30.1, 35.6, 43.2, and 57.2 are assigned to 
magnetite (Kong et al., 2017) , whereas the peak observed in MBC at 33.2 is assigned to 
hematite.  The emergence of these peak s on the surface of MBC confirm ed the presence of 
Fe-O in the structure of the modified biochar adsorbent. Al et al., (2021 ) detected a peak at a 
similar angular degree for Fe 3O4 cubic crystals on an adsorbent prepared from powdered 
activated carbon magnetized by iron (III) oxide magnetic nanoparticles.  
Figure 2. XRD patter ns of raw and modified biochars  
Iron (Fe) was believed to be present on the surface of modified biochar (MBC) as indicated 
by characteristic peaks of mag netite and hematite (He et al., 2018 ; Mian et al., 2018; Gong et 
al., 2016 ). The XRD result revealed that Fe was successfully loaded onto the MBC , which is 
consistent with the findings of the FTIR analysis. Therefore, the chemical modification of the 
biochar has desirable structural changes on the biochar , as evidenced by the XRD plot.   
              3.1.4. Point of zero charge ( pH pzc) 
 Determin ing pH pzc is essential for the adsorption process study as the adsorption 
mechanism strongly depends  on the solution pH. The point of zero charge of MBC is about 
6.5, as shown in Fig  S1. Based on the pH pzc result, the surface of MBC is positively charged 
when pH is below 6.5 and negatively charged when pH is above 6.5. At pH below 6.0, 
ciprofloxacin is mainly present in its cationic form (Peng et al., 2018), and the surface of the 
MBC is positively charged.  Hence, the adsorbent and ciprofloxacin molecules repel each 
other, and  thus CIP removal efficiency decrease d. Increasing pH above 6.1 changes  the CIP 
molecule from cationic to zwitterion ic leading to a gradual increase in CIP adsorption 
(Atugoda et al., 2 021). Due to the strong electrostatic interaction between MBC and CIP 
zwitterion  (pH 6.0 -8.7), maxim um adsorption  was obtained . 
 In contrast , at pH higher than 8.7, the adsorption process efficiency decrease d as the 
repulsive force increased between the negatively charged MBC surface and anionic CIP 
molecules (Asghar et al., 2019b). Similar results were obtained by Asghar et al.  (2019b) in 
removing ciprofloxacin from water using γ -Al2O3 nanoparticles. Consistently, Ji et al.  (2021)  
reported similar results with a pH range  (6–8) as an optim al condition for titanate nanotubes 
to remove CIP molecules . 
3.2. Adsorption of CIP onto MBC adsorbent  
 In this work , different bamboo -based adsorbents: unmodified bamboo biochar (UBC), 
bamboo biochar modified with ferric chloride (FBC), bamboo biochar modified with 
potassium hydroxide (KMBC), and bamboo biochar modified with both ferric chloride and 
potassium hydroxide ( MBC) were prepared. The CIP removal efficiencies and adsorption 
capacities of the as -synthesized bamboo -based adsorbents are shown in Table 2. MBC was 
prepared chemically by modifying the bamboo sawdust with ferric chloride and potassium 
hydroxide at the s ame time as depicted in section 2.2 . As shown in Table 2, the UBC, FMBC, 
KMBC , and MBC gave  45.01, 67.38, 79.45, and 95.67 % CIP removal , respectively. This 
experiment was conducted at CIP initial concentration  (25 mg L-1), adsorbent dose (0.5 g L-1), 
conta ct time (46.25 min ), and pH (7.0). The result indicated that modification of the bamboo 
by KOH, FeCl 3, or KOH/FeCl 3 has resulted in increased CIP removal. The high adsorption capacity can be ascribed to the high surface area of the adsorbent (1158.05 m2/g) and the 
strong interaction of CIP molecules with MBC surface functional groups.  
 MBC has remarkably superior adsorption capacity (78.43 mg g-1) than all other 
bamboo -based adsorbents (UBC, FMBC, and KMBC). This may be attributed to the 
collaborative ef fect of both KOH and FeCl 3 activation. Fe -O group was detected on the 
surface of the MBC as confirmed by XRD and FTIR spectra  analysis . The high adsorption 
performance observed for KOH/ FeCl 3 modified adsorbent is may be due to the formation of  
Fe-O sorption sites  (Chen et al., 2011 ; Zhao et al., 2018 ; Chen et al., 2019 ; Reguyal et al., 
2016)  in addition to the formation of -OH, C -H, C -O, C≡O functional groups. Iron functional 
groups may form a complex reaction with CIP zwitterions increasing  CIP removal from 
aqueous solution.  Hence, MBC (bamboo biochar with combined modification) was selected 
and used as the best adsorbent throughout this study.  The adsorbent has magnetic properties 
because of iron which may help during the separation of the adsorbent.

3.2.1. Model  fitting and analysis of variance (ANOVA) using CCD   
 The central composite design (CCD) was used to optimize the CIP adsorption process 
parameters.  The CCD experimental design of CIP adsorption data is presented in Table S1.  
The second -order polynomial model fitted the experimental data of CIP adsorption onto 
MBC  (R2 = 0.98 61). The suggested quadratic model 's R2 and adjusted R2 were 0.9 904 and 
0.9861, respectively. ANOVA was used to assess the validity and adequacy of the model and 
determine  the effect of main factors and possible interaction  factors. ANOVA indicated that 
the suggested polynomial model was statistically significant. The result of the ANOVA 
analysis is presented in Table 3. As shown in Table 3, the F - and p -values of the model were 229.46  and < 0.0001, respectively. There is only a 0.01% chance that an F -value this large 
could occur due to noise.  A, B, C, D, AB, BD, CD, B², and C² are significant model terms 
from the ANOVA table . Hence, all the independent variables (init ial CIP concentration, pH, 
contact time , and adsorbent dosage) significantly affected  the CIP removal. Both Yousefi et 
al. and Asghar et al. reported  similar finding s for the CIP removal using magnetization of 
functionalized multi -walled carbon nanotubes and γ -Al2O3 nanoparticles as an adsorbent , 
respectively  (Yousefi et al., 2021 ; Asghar et al., 2019a ). In their studies, adsorption 
parameters  including initial CIP concentration, pH, contact duration, and adsorbent dose, 
were  significant in CIP removal from an aqueous solution.  
 Model terms with p -values l ess than 0.05 are significant , and terms with p -values 
higher than 0.05 are not significant . Relative to pure error, the Lack of Fit is not significant , 
as indicated by the Lack of Fit F -value of 1.74. There is a 28.06 % chance that a Lack of Fit 
F-value this large could occur due to noise. As a result, a lack of fit that is not signi ficant is 
desired since we want the model to fit the CIP experimental data well. Adeq  precision 
measures the signal -to-noise ratio  and a value greater than 4 is desirable. In this design, the 
ratio of 56.593  indicates an adequate signal. This model can be used to navigate the design 
space successfully .

The influence of each factor on the removal of CIP can be seen from the ir coefficients in Eq . 
(19). The coefficients of each factor are -5.98, 9.38, -2.70, and 5.12, respectively, confirming 
that A and C have a negative effect , whereas B and D ha ve a positive effect on the CIP 
removal.  The r esults displayed in Table 3 indicated  that the influence of each parameter on 
the CIP removal  followed the order: B > A > D > C, which is in agreement with the results 
described in Eq . (19). Notably , the adsorbent dose  and the initial concentration of CIP  had the 
most significant effect on the CIP removal  process . Also , the final equation in terms of the

According to the model fit statistics, the regression parameters such as the coefficient of 
determination (R2), adjusted coefficient of determination , and predicted deter mination 
coefficients are 0.9876, 0.9820 , and 0.9670 , respectively. Thus, the model re presents 98% of 
the variation in the CIP removal response . The values of model regression parameters 
indicate  proper fitness of the model  as shown in Table 2. Using the CCD experimental 
design, Asghar and his co -workers  reported similar model fit statistics values (R2 = 0.96) for 
the CIP adsorption (Asghar et al.,2019b) . 
 Diagnostic plots  such as  externally studentized residuals against predicted, predicted 
against actual, and the normal probability against externally studentized residuals  were 
analyzed to assess the model's adequacy. These results are  presented in  Fig S2 (a -c). The 
normal probability against ex ternally studentized residual plot shown in  Fig S2 (a)  indicated 
that all  the points are close to the straight line, showing that t he error was normally 
distributed. From the plot of predicted against actual shown in Fig S2 (b ), it can be seen that the predicted values are well correlated with the actual (experimental) values , and the model 
predicted data were not significantly differ ent from the experimental results. The highest 
residual (difference betwe en actual and predicted) is 2.93 for the CIP removal of 88.35 %. In a 
plot of externally studentized residuals against predicted  shown in Fig S2 (c) , the residuals 
were  randoml y distributed between +3 .00 and −3.00, indicating that the CCD model 
successfully established the relationship between the independent variable and the CIP 
removal (Peng et al., 2021) . Overall, the  diagnostic plot results a gree with the coefficient of 
determination values of the model. Thus, the quadratic model suggested by CCD 
experimental design described the experimental CIP adsorption data adequately.  
3.2.2. Effect  of individual process variables  
 The effect of the adsorption process variables such as pH, initial CIP concentration, 
adsorbent dose , and contact time on CIP removal  was investigated. Fig  S3 (a-d) displays the 
one factor plots for each main factor . These include initial CIP concentration, adsorbent dose , 
pH, and contact time . 
Effect of CIP initial concentration  
 The effect of initial CIP concentration on the adsorption efficiency was investigated. 
Fig S3(a) depicted that increasing the CIP initial concentration from 10 to 40 mg L-1 
decreased the CIP removal efficiency from 100 to 75.52% at pH (7.5), adsorbent dose ( 0.5 g 
L-1), and contact time ( 46.25 min ). In line with this result, Yousefi et al.  reported that 
increasing the CIP concentration from 3 0 to 100 mg L-1 decreased  CIP removal efficiency 
from 83% to 59% ( Yousefi et al., 2021 ).  On the other hand, Wang et al. investigated the 
effect of the initial CIP concentration (10–200 mg L-1) at pH (6) and adsorbent dosage  (135 
mg L-1) on the adsorption capacity. In their study, the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent for 
cationic CIP increased very quickly for CIP initial concentration of less than 50 mg L-1 and 
then decreased with the increase of CIP initial concentration above 50 m g L-1 (Wang et al., 
2018 ). Hence, an increase in CIP initial concentration decrease d the removal efficiency. This 
may be attributed to the lack of available sites on the adsorbent for  the uptake of  high CIP 
concentration (El-bendary et al., 2021) . In this study , unlike the case for CIP percentage 
removal, the CIP adsorption capacity increased from 20 mg g-1 to 60 mg g-1 by increasing the 
initial CIP  concentration from 10 to 40 mg L-1. This is due to the reduction of the resistance 
to CIP uptake  from the aqueous solution. Moreover, the higher initial CIP concentration provides a driving force to overcome the mass transfer resistance of the CIP between  the 
solid and aqueous phases (El-bendary et al., 2021) . 
Effect of a dsorbent dose  
 The adsorbent dose has a significant effect on the CIP removal  from an aqueous 
solution . As depicted in Fig  S3(b), using an adsorbent dose of 0.25 g L-1 at pH 7.5, 30 mg L-1 
initial CIP concentration , and 46.25  min contact time resulted in 96.02  % CIP removal , 
whereas  using an adsorbent dose of 1.0  g L-1 at similar adsorption conditions almost 
completely removed CIP from the solution . A similar adsorption trend was observed by 
(Gulen and Demircivi, 2020)  in the adsorption of CIP from water using a 2: 1 dioctahedral 
clay structure with the increase of CIP adsorption from 1.8 % (0.034 g L-1) to 99.2% (2 g L-1). 
Moreover,  Shang et al. reported a significant increase in the CIP rem oval efficiency from 36 
to 100%, for an increase in adsorbent (herbal residue biochar) d osage from 0.025 to 0.5 g L-1 
(Shang et al. 2016) . The increase in the percentage of CIP removal with an increase in 
adsorbent dose is because of the increase of available active sites , which enhanced the CIP 
uptake  (Khoshnamvand et al., 2017 ; Asghar et al., 2019b) .  
Effect of pH  
 The pH of the solution is an important  parameter of adsorption processes because it 
affects the surface nature of the adsorbent and adsorbate -adsorbent interactions (Asghar et al., 
2019b) . At pH  less than pKa1 (6.1), the amine group in piperazine moiety receive s a proton , 
and CIP+ appear s. However, for pH above pKa 2 (8.7), CIP occurs in  anionic form (CIP−) due 
to amine group deprotonation. At pH between pKa 1 and pKa 2 of CIP,  the CIP molecule exists 
in zwitterionic form due to  the charge balance of the amine and carboxylic groups  (Zhang et 
al., 2017; Yousefi et al., 2021) . Fig  S3(c) depicted that the CIP removal efficiency of MBC 
increase d by increasing the pH of the solution from 5.25 to 7.5 and then decrease d with any 
further increase in pH. Hence, increasing pH from 5.25 to  7.5 at fixed initial CIP 
concentration  (20 mg L-1), adsorbent dose ( 0.5g L-1), and contact time ( 46.25 min ) increased 
the CIP removal from 93.62% to 96.02%.  Further elevation of pH to 9.75 reduced the CIP 
removal to 94.61%. Thus , the optim al pH for CIP adsorption onto the MBC is  7.5. This pH 
level is very important since ciprofloxacin forms zwitterion and that led to the strong 
electrostatic attraction between CIP and negatively charged MBC. Hence, maximum 
adsorption was obtained at this pH level.  Dehghan et al. (2019)  observed a similar adsorption 
trend for the CIP using a metal organic framework (MOF). They reported that an increase in pH from 3 to 7.5 increased the adsorption of CIP on to MOF. However, at pH values above 
7.5, CIP adsorption decreased. The reason for this adsorption behavior can be attributed to 
protonation –deprotonation reactions in groups of CIP molecule s (Dehghan et al., 2019) . 
Effect of c ontact time  
 Contact time is one of the significant factors in the adsorption of the CIP onto the 
MBC  in this work. As shown in Fig  S3 (d), adsorption at an adsorbent dose (0.5 g L-1), pH 
(7.5), CIP  initial concentration  (20 mg L-1), and the contact time  (18.75 min ) result ed in 
79.58 % of CIP removal. However,  CIP removal efficiency increased to 96.02 % under 
similar adsorption conditions  when the contact time increased to 46.25 min. Moreover, Fig 
S4 showed that the adsorption rate  was rapid in the first 30 minutes and moderate in 30 -70 
minutes. This may be attributed to the availability of abundant free active sites on MBC at the 
initial adsorption  stage  for CIP sorption. The rat e bec ame very slow after 70 minutes , and no 
appreciable CIP removal was achieved. Hence, equilibrium was reached at about 70 min. The 
number of available active sites decreases with time , and eventually , the adsorbent becomes 
saturated (El-bendary et al., 2021) . For CIP adsorption process optimization, adsorption 
experiments were conducted using the contact time  range  (less than 60 min) , which is  
intentionally taken  to fully investigate the effect of contact time and its interaction effects . 
Increasing  the contact time allowed CIP molecules to reach the active sites of the adsorbent  
up to equilibrium time . Beyond  the equilibrium time , no significant uptake of  CIP took place  
as depicted in Fig S4 .  
3.2.3. Interaction effects of process variables  
 Response surface methodology is a powerful tool with important  feature s for 
evaluating  the interactive effect of variables. In this study , 3D surface plots (Fig 3 (a-c)) were 
employed to study the interaction effects  on the CIP removal . The significant interaction 
effects include initial CIP concentration -adsorbent dose, adsorbent dose -contact time , and 
pH-contact time .  
CIP initial concentration  and adsorbent dose interaction effect  
 The interaction effect of CIP initial concentration and the adsorbent dose was shown 
in Fig 3 (a). The interaction effect of CIP initial concentration and the adsorbent dose was 
positively significant.  From the 3D plot, it was observed that the CIP removal was highest at 
the initial CIP concentration  range of 20-25mg L-1 and adsorbent dose  range of 0.75–1.0 g L-1. The enhanced  removal of CIP at the higher MBC dose  was due to higher  active sites for 
CIP adsorption (Bhattacharya et al. , 2021) . 
Adsorbent dose and contact time interaction effect  
 The interaction effect of MBC dose and the contact time on CIP removal  is displayed 
using a 3D plot in Fig  3 (b). CIP removal  was highest at the MBC dose of 0.75 -1.0g L-1 and at 
the reaction time of 40-46 min. This study revealed that CIP removal  increased with an 
increase in contact time and adsorbent dose . This is may be attributed to the availability of 
more active sites with adsorbent dose increment and enough contact time for MBC and CIP 
molecules  to interact  with each other (Bhattacharya et al. , 2021) .  
pH and contact time interaction effect  
 The interaction effect of pH and contact time on CIP removal is shown in Fig 3 (c). 
The percentage of CIP removal increased with an increase in contact time. A kinetics study 
showed that the adsorption rate was rapid in the first 30 minutes and became slow after 30 
minutes. The CIP adsorption is strongly dependent on the pH of the solution. CIP exists in 
zwitterion form at pH between 6.1 and 8.7, and the electrostatic interaction bet ween CIP and 
MBC is strong . The point of zero charge of MBC was 6.5 , and for pH less than 6.1 and 
beyond 8.7, the repulsive forces became dominant , and less CIP removal was achieved. Thus, 
this pH range is an optimum pH level for the highest CIP removal.  Fig 3 (c) depicted tha t 
when pH decreased from 9.75 to 5.25 with an increase in contact time from 18.75 to 46.25 
min, the CIP removal increased  from 71.88 to 93.62%. In contrast, an increase in pH and a 
decrease in contact time decreased CIP removal. The reverse of this conditi on decreased the 
CIP removal. This showed that contact time had a superior influence on CIP removal than pH 
for interaction effects. However, for an increase in pH and contact time from 5.25 and 
18.75min to 9.75 and 46.25min, CIP removal increased from 83.07 to 94.61%, respectively. 
Maximum CIP removal (96.02) was obtained at pH (7.5) and contact time  (46.25 min ) using 
MBC adsorbent .

time versus adsorbent dose (c) contact time versus pH  
3.2.4. Process optimization  
 The optimization approach followed in CCD design to obtain the best operating 
conditions was by minimizing the adsorbent dosage, taking the initial CIP concentration in 
the range, pH in the range , and contact time in the range , and by maximizing CIP removal. 
Based on this criterion, the optim al condition that gave maximum CIP removal efficiency 
(96.02%) using the MBC adsorbent was pH (7.5), adsorbent  (0.5 g L-1), contact time  (46.257 
min) , and initial CIP concentration  (20 mg L-1) with a good desirability value of 0.971 . 
Adsorption test s were conducted at these  optimum condition s to confirm the model's 
a 
b 
c 
credibility . Accordingly, CIP removal values of 95.68, 96 .42, and 96.24 were obtained , and 
the mean  value of these results is 96.11%. Thus, the model predic ted CIP removal (96%)  is 
close to the experimental value obtained (96.11%) , showing that the model is valid . 
3.3. Adsorption kinetics  
 The kinetic study determines the effect of contact time on CIP adsorption  onto MBC . 
The results of CIP adsorption kinetics parameters are described in Table 4. The kinetic 
models are presented in Fig 4 (a -d). Initially, the sorption process was vigorous due to 
abundant free actives sites on the biochar surface  where CIP molecules can be sorbed  
quickly . With time, the unoccupied active sites reduce d significantly, declining the solution 
and solid  adsorption rate to  attain a steady  state (Atugoda et al., 2021) .  
 As shown in Table 4, the pseudo -second -order model has the highest coefficient of 
determination (R2 = 0.994) compared to other kinetic models. In addition, q e (calculated) 
using a pseudo -second -order kinetic model is very close to the experimental q e. Hence, the 
pseudo -second -order model provided the best fit for the CIP experimental data  as shown in 
Fig 4 (b) , suggesting that the rate of ciprofloxacin adsorption onto the MBC followed the 
pseudo -second -order model. Overall, these results suggest that ch emisorption control led the 
rate of CIP adsorption (Soares et al., 2019 ; Balarak et al., 2021) , which involves covalent 
bonding through sharing electrons between MBC and CIP molecule (Atugoda et al., 2021) . 
More specifically, the π -π interaction , complexation reaction , and hydrogen bonding may 
have played a role in the chemisorption process. Similar findings have been reported in the 
literature (Wang et al., 2015) .  
 The intraparticle diffusion model  was employed to investigate the rate-controlling 
step (Ngeno  et al., 2016) . As the Ko increases, the contribution of the surface sorption in the 
rate-controlling step increases. The linear fit plot of qt versus t0.5 is displayed in Fig 4 (d). The 
simple plot of qt versus t0.5 for the intraparticle model presented in Fig S5 showed multi -
linear behavior. This suggest s that the adsorption process possessed  multiple steps. Solute 
adsorption by porous adsorbents consists of three consecutive steps (Balarak et al.,2021) . The 
first step represents the improvisational or external adsorption  process . The second step is the 
intraparticle diffusi on phase having gradual adsorption that occurs when intraparticle 
diffusion is rate -limiting. The last step is regarded as a final equilibrium phase in which the 
intraparticle diffusion starts to slow down due to a significantly lower adsorbate 
concentrati on. The intraparticle diffusion is the rate -limiting step when the regression line passes through the origin. In contrast, when the regression line does not pass through  the 
origin,  other mechanisms can control the adsorption process in addition to intraparticle 
diffusion.   
 The plots showed a multi -linear trend, indicating that there were three steps during the 
CIP adsorption process, as shown in Fig. S5. The first stage occurred from 0 to 30 min0.5  and 
represe nted boundary layer mass transfer (Balarak and Mckay, 2021) . The second linear 
segment included the adsorption period fro m 30–80 min0.5 and which represents the 
intraparticle diffusion process. The third st age took place between 8 0 and 120 min0.5 and 
adsorption of CIP mole cules occurred on the interior surface of the MBC . The last stage 
showed  quite low  slope due to the decrease in CIP concentrations  (Zhang et al., 2017)  and 
available active sites (Balarak et a l., 2021)  suggesting  that the adsorption  equilibrium  was 
reached . In the first step , the adsorption rate was rapid, indicating  a fast removal of CIP, 
while in the  subsequent steps , the adsorption process decreased  due to the decrease in CIP 
concentrations and available active sites (Balarak et al., 2021) . Also, the low linear 
dependency of CIP adsorption on t0.5 indicated that the CIP adsorption dyna mics seemed to 
be less influenced by the intraparticle diffusion mechanism (Ngeno et al., 2016) . On the other 
hand, the high K o parameter value showed that the effect of the boundary layer was also 
responsible for the CIP adsorption onto MBC. Hence, it was noted that the adsorption of CIP 
onto MBC was enhanced due to the high surface ar ea of the MBC and by the involvement of 
various  functional groups on the surface of  biochar (Atugoda et al., 2021) . Overall , the 
adsorption rate of CIP onto MBC was jointly controlled by liquid film diffusion, surface 
adsorption , and intraparticle diffusion (Huang et al., 2018) .

3.4. Adsorption isotherms  
 The isotherm models are crucial  for adsorption processes because the isotherm 
models can provide maximum sorption capacity and the expected interactions between 
adsorbent and adsorbate (Balarak  et al., 2021) . This study considered four isotherm models  to 
interpret and describe CIP adsorption data, including Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, and 
Dubinin - Radushkevich (DR) . Adsorption isotherm parameters were evaluated and presented 
in Table 5. Also, the plots of CIP adsorption isotherm are presented in Fig 5  (a-d). An 
increase in initial concentration  increased CIP adsorption capacity because the binding sites 
could easily come into contact with  the adsorbate. After the saturation of the active sites at a 
a 
b 
c 
 d particular concentration, the adsorption remains unaffected with initial concentrations 
(Atugoda et al., 2021) .  
 From the Langmuir isotherm, the  calculated value of R L using Eq.(13)  can 
characteri ze the type of the isotherm and its nature: (i) irreversible  isotherm (R L=0); (ii) 
favorable isotherm (0 <R L<1); (iii) linear isotherm (R L=1); unfavorable  isotherm (R L>1) ( Li 
et al., 2018;  Stylianou et al., 2021) . In this st udy, R L was 0.0264 , which depicted that the CIP 
adsorption process by MBC was favorable. The results of regression coefficients indicate d 
that the Langmuir (R2 = 0.99) model fit s the adsorption process well , as shown in Fig 4 (a) . 
Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm  models  fitted the CIP adsorption data reasonably , as 
described in Fig 4 (a) and (b), respectively . Conformity to these  models showed that the 
MBC surface nature was heterogeneous , and this result is consistent with the intraparticle 
kinetic study that hypothesized the  multi -mechanistic nature of CIP adsorption onto MBC 
(Sharifpour et al., 2020) .  
 In this study, t he MBC surface heterogeneity was confirmed by the Freundlich 
constant, 1/n, which was 0.11 and lay between 0 and 1 for heterogeneous surfaces.  In this 
model, if the value of n is higher than 10 , an irreversible isotherm is obtained. Values of n 
greater than unity indicat e preferential adsorption, and less than unity indicates poor 
adsorption . In the present study, the value of n is greater than unity , as indicated in Table  5. 
Hence , the adsorption of CIP onto MBC was favorable.  It can be concluded that the 
adsorption process was monolayer adsorption on a heterogeneous surface  which is in 
agreement with the previous work  by (Li et al., 2018) . The functional groups of the modified 
biochar (MBC) responsible for the CIP adsorption inclu de the OH, C -H, C -O, C≡O , and Fe –
O –Fe. These functional groups on the biochar provide d a heterogeneous surface. Accordi ng 
to the experimental findings, CIP adsorption onto these functional groups of the MBC would 
be in a monolayer  fashion .

3.5. Thermodynamic s and regeneration study   
 Thermodynamic parameters of CIP adsorption onto MBC were calculated using Eqs. 
(17-19) and the results are shown in Table 6. 
                 Table 3. Values of thermodynamic parameters for CIP adsorption onto MBC

The obtained negative values of ∆Gº indicated the spontaneity of the sorption process (Huang 
et al., 2018) . These results show that higher temperatures slightly  favored  CIP adsorption 
onto the MBC. The positive values of change in enthalpy (ΔHº) for CIP adsorption  showed  
that the CIP sorption was an  endothermic  process . The change in entropy (ΔS0) represents the 
adsorbent 's attraction to the biochar surface . 
 The positive value of the entropy for CIP  adsorption onto MBC indicated  that the 
solvent molecules occupied on the surface were easily displaced by CIP molecules enhancing 
the adsorption capacity (Atugoda et al., 2021) . In the current study, the positive values of 
change in entropy showed that  the p rocess of CIP adsorption was spontaneous. In conclusion,  
the negative Gibbs free energy and positive entropy values revealed that the CIP adsorption 
was favorable  (Atugoda et al., 2021) . 
3.6. Adsorbent regeneration study  
 A regeneration study was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of MBC in the CIP 
adsorption process. Various CIP desorption solutions such as methanol , dilute HCl, 3% 
NaOH + methanol , and NaOH  have been used in previous studies (Al et al., 2021 ; 
Balasubramani et al., 2020 ; Ghadiri et al., 2020)  and thus selected and tested  in MBC 
regeneration  study . The CIP removal  efficiency  of MBC  after first cycle desorption with 0.3 
M NaOH , Methanol, 3% NaOH + methanol , and 0.3M HCl w as 72.7, 47.09, 67.96 , and 
93.56 %, respectively.  Hence, 0.3 M HCl was used as an eluent for CIP desorption throughout 
the regeneration study.  After  5 sequential adsorption/desorption cycles, the removal of  CIP 
by MBC varied from 95.68% to 88.13 % (reduction of 7.55%) as shown in Fig. 6 . The 
reusability studies revealed that 88% of CIP can be removed even in the fifth cycle 
suggesting enhanced stability and reusability of MBC.  The reusability of the MBC without 
significant loss in CIP removal is one of the benefits of this process regarding environmental 
concerns and economic feasibility.

3.7. Comparison of MBC with other sorbents  
 The maximum adsorption capacity of MBC was 78.43 mg g-1. The high adsorption 
capacity of MBC can be ascribed to the cooperative adsorption mechanism between CIP 
molecules and MBC. Table 7 summa rizes the CIP adsorption  capacity reported for various 
sorbents.

This study  
 
 The use of adsorbent s for the effective removal of emerging pollutant s such as 
pharmaceut ical contaminants from water is a promising technology. In this study, MBC was 
found to be effective for the removal of pharmaceutical contaminants such as ciprofloxacin 
from wastewater. C ompared to others, MBC has shown higher adsorption efficiency at a 
relatively lower dose and less contact time for higher pollutant concentration.  The adsorbent 
(MBC) can be synthesized from cheap and easily available raw materials  promoting the 
circular economy . Another benefit of MBC is the simplicity of the preparation steps compared to other adsorbents having complex synthesis steps. Moreover, MB C can be easily 
separated from the solution by filtration or magnetic separation. For practical water 
remediation applications, issues related to biochar applications in water such as the release of 
poly aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) need to be considered. In this regard, the biochar has to 
meet certification requirements at the commercial scale before being applied in practical 
water treatment processes as presented in the recent work on biochar production and 
certification (Osman et al., 2022) . Future research work s need to focus  on the effect of real 
wastewater matrix, type of the activated biochar (granular or powder) , and chemical 
activation after pyrolysis on  the removal of CIP using MBC.  
3.8. Adsorption mechanism  
 According to the FTIR analysis, it can be concluded that the -OH groups, C -H groups 
in aromatic rings, C -O alkyne, phenolic C -O bonds , and Fe -O-Fe detected on the surface of 
MBC may have played a significant role in the CIP adsorption process. This indicates  that 
MBC mainly consists of aromatics, and π –π donor -acceptor interactions may occur during 
adsorption  (Li et al., 2018) . The graphitic and aromatic nature of the biochar provides 
electron -rich π clouds , which act as π donors. Hence, the π -π electron -donor -acceptor (EDA) 
interaction occurs  between the biochar and electron -deficient moieties of CIP (π acceptors) , 
enhancing the overall adsorptio n process . In CIP adsorption using MBC (pHpzc = 6.5), at 
low pH  values (less than pKa 1 = 6.1) , the surface functional groups and unsaturated arene 
groups of the MBC were protonated; thus , the π electron donor interaction with CIP was 
minimum. However, when  pH increases  from 6.1 to 8.7 (pKa 2), CIP becomes zwitterionic  
and capable of acting as both π donor and acceptor, promoting  interactions with the biochar 
surface (Atugoda et al., 2021) . Moreover, the –OH and –COOH groups on the MBC surface 
may form hydrogen bonding with moieties such as N and F -containing groups on the CIP 
molecules.  
 Furthermore , ion exchange may happen in the adsor ption  process. The piperazine 
rings of CIP mole cules were positively charged ( NH 2+) in neutral or faintly acid solution, and 
the CIP+ may be attracted by the polar and alkaline surface of biochar with H+ releasing (Li et 
al., 2020a) . Also,  a complexation reaction between the Fe on the biochar and CIP molecules  
might be another removal mechanism (Li et al., 2020a) . The Fe species probably produce 
hydrous oxide on the surface of biochar, and one O of the carboxylate group in the CIP 
molecule may bind with the hydrous oxide surface . The reason may be that the CIP molecule forms  a six -membered ring with an Fe atom through one O of the carboxylate group and keto 
O (Gu and Karthikeyan, 2005) . The complexation reaction probably occurs between the 
ketone or carboxylate functional groups of zwitterions, CIP, and Fe 2O3 of the biochar. The O 
atom in the carboxylic group of CIP zwitterions has been reported with a more potent ligand 
to interact with Fe3+ (Li et al., 2021) . The iron species on the surface of MBC may have 
enhance d CIP adsorption  through  a complexation reaction . In fact, the adsorbent screening 
test revealed that bamboo biochar modified solely with ferric chloride has higher CIP 
removal efficiency (67.38%) than the unmodified or raw bamboo biochar (45.01%), 
suggesting that the iron species were  involved in the CIP adsorption process. This can be 
supported  by the disappearance of the peak assigne d to the  iron species on the FTIR spectra 
after adsorption .  
4. Conclusion s 
 In this study, the adsorption of ciprofloxacin onto MBC was optimized by response 
surface methodology through the central composite design approach. The results depicted 
that the efficiency of ciprofloxacin adsorption was reduce d at both acidic and alkalin e 
conditions due to the interplay between the pKa value of ciprofloxacin and the pH zpc value of 
the MBC . The optimization study indicated that the adsorbent dose and contact time variables 
directly correlate  with CIP removal efficiency , whereas the initial  concentration of CIP has an 
inverse relationship with the removal efficiency. Statistical analysis revealed that the 
considered levels of MBC dose and CIP initial concentration ha d the most significant effects 
on CIP adsorption compared to other parameter s studied. Based on the CCD design, the 
optim al operating conditions obtained for CIP adsorption onto MBC were pH  (7.5), adsorbent 
dose (0.5  g L-1), initial CIP concentration (20 mg L-1), and contact ti me (46 min) , which gave 
a remarkably high CIP removal of 96%. The adsorption process experimental kinetic da ta 
were well described by the Pseudo -second -order kinetic model , suggesting that  the 
chemisorption  process  mainly controlled  the adsorption rate . On the other hand, a kinetic 
study of intraparticle diffusion revealed that the adsorption rate  was jointly controlled by 
liquid film diffusion, surface adsorption , and intra -particle diffusion . 
 Moreover, the isotherm study showed that Langmuir (R2 = 0.994) and the Freundlich 
(R2 = 0.972) models fit the experimental CIP adsorption data with Langmuir's superior 
goodness  of fit. Thus, it can be deduced from these results that the adsorption of CIP onto 
MBC was a mono layer on a heter ogeneous surface. Als o, Langmuir's (R L) and Freundlich's (n) model parameters  have indicated that CIP adsorption  was favorable. Compared to the 
unmodified biochar, modifying  bamboo with ferric chloride and alkali (potassium hydroxide) 
improved its surface structure and specifi c surface area. Hence, higher adsorption of CIP was 
observed for MBC than for UBC. Besides surface area increment, modification of the biochar 
increased biochar aromaticity. The various functional groups on the biochar surface were 
mainly responsible for CIP adsorption onto the MBC through π -π interaction, hydrogen 
bonding, ion exchange,  and electrostatic interaction . Moreover, the iron species on the 
surface of MBC resulting from the bamboo's ferric chloride modification  has probably led 
complexation reac tion be tween biochar and CIP molecule. Thus , the high BET surface area 
(1158.05m2/g) and the involvement of various functional groups in the adsorption process 
resulted in higher CIP removal by MBC from an aqueous solution. The thermodynamic study 
has show n that the CIP adsorption process was endothermic and spontaneous.  Thus,  this 
study revealed that MBC  could be an effective adsorbent for removing  ciprofloxacin from 
water due to its high adsorptive capacity  and excellent recyclability.   
 Higher CIP uptake  capacity and excellent reusability of the MBC could be a 
promising indication for practical applications.  In the future, the performance  of MBC  in the 
removal of multiple pharmaceutical contaminants with different characteristics shall be 
addressed  using fixed -bed column  adsorption .
