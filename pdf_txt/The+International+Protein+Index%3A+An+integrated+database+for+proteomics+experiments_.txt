lumiRatAllACCNUM Map Manufacturer identiﬁers to Accession Numbers
Description
lumiRatAllACCNUM is an R object that contains mappings between a manufacturer’s identiﬁers
and manufacturers accessions.
Details
For chip packages such as this, the ACCNUM mapping comes directly from the manufacturer. This
is different from other mappings which are mapped onto the probes via an Entrez Gene identiﬁer.
Each manufacturer identiﬁer maps to a vector containing a GenBank accession number.
Mappings were based on data provided by: Entrez Gene ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/DATA With
a date stamp from the source of: 2012-Mar7
Examples
x <- lumiRatAllACCNUM
# Get the probe identiﬁers that are mapped to an ACCNUM
mapped_probes <- mappedkeys(x)
# Convert to a list
xx <- as.list(x[mapped_probes])
if(length(xx) > 0) {
# Get the ACCNUM for the ﬁrst ﬁve probes
xx[1:5]
# Get the ﬁrst one
xx[[1]]

lumiRatAllALIAS2PROBE
Map between Common Gene Symbol Identiﬁers and Manufacturer
Identiﬁers
Description
lumiRatAllALIAS is an R object that provides mappings between common gene symbol identiﬁers
and manufacturer identiﬁers.
Details
Each gene symbol is mapped to a named vector of manufacturer identiﬁers. The name represents
the gene symbol and the vector contains all manufacturer identiﬁers that are found for that symbol.
AnNAis reported for any gene symbol that cannot be mapped to any manufacturer identiﬁers.
This mapping includes ALL gene symbols including those which are already listed in the SYMBOL
map. The SYMBOL map is meant to only list ofﬁcial gene symbols, while the ALIAS maps are
meant to store all used symbols.

lumiRatAll.db Bioconductor annotation data package
Description
Welcome to the lumiRatAll.db annotation Package. The purpose of this package is to provide
detailed information about the lumiRatAll platform. This package is updated biannually.
You can learn what objects this package supports with the following command:
ls("package:lumiRatAll.db")
Each of these objects has their own manual page detailing where relevant data was obtained along
with some examples of how to use it.
Examples
ls("package:lumiRatAll.db")lumiRatAllCHRLENGTHS 3
lumiRatAllCHRLENGTHS
A named vector for the length of each of the chromosomes
Description
lumiRatAllCHRLENGTHS provides the length measured in base pairs for each of the chromo-
somes.
Details
This is a named vector with chromosome numbers as the names and the corresponding lengths for
chromosomes as the values.
Total lengths of chromosomes were derived by calculating the number of base pairs on the sequence
string for each chromosome.
Examples
tt <- lumiRatAllCHRLENGTHS
# Length of chromosome 1
tt["1"]
lumiRatAllCHRLOC Map Manufacturer IDs to Chromosomal Location
Description
lumiRatAllCHRLOC is an R object that maps manufacturer identiﬁers to the starting position of
the gene. The position of a gene is measured as the number of base pairs.
The CHRLOCEND mapping is the same as the CHRLOC mapping except that it speciﬁes the
ending base of a gene instead of the start.
Details
Each manufacturer identiﬁer maps to a named vector of chromosomal locations, where the name
indicates the chromosome. Due to inconsistencies that may exist at the time the object was built,
these vectors may contain more than one chromosome and/or location. If the chromosomal location
is unknown, the vector will contain an NA.
Chromosomal locations on both the sense and antisense strands are measured as the number of base
pairs from the p (5’ end of the sense strand) to q (3’ end of the sense strand) arms. Chromosomal
locations on the antisense strand have a leading "-" sign (e. g. -1234567).
Since some genes have multiple start sites, this ﬁeld can map to multiple locations.

lumiRatAllCHR Map Manufacturer IDs to Chromosomes
Description
lumiRatAllCHR is an R object that provides mappings between a manufacturer identiﬁer and the
chromosome that contains the gene of interest.
Details
Each manufacturer identiﬁer maps to a vector of chromosomes. Due to inconsistencies that may
exist at the time the object was built, the vector may contain more than one chromosome (e.g., the
identiﬁer may map to more than one chromosome). If the chromosomal location is unknown, the
vector will contain an NA.

lumiRatAllENTREZID Map between Manufacturer Identiﬁers and Entrez Gene
Description
lumiRatAllENTREZID is an R object that provides mappings between manufacturer identiﬁers and
Entrez Gene identiﬁers.
Details
Each manufacturer identiﬁer is mapped to a vector of Entrez Gene identiﬁers. An NAis assigned
to those manufacturer identiﬁers that can not be mapped to an Entrez Gene identiﬁer at this time.
If a given manufacturer identiﬁer can be mapped to different Entrez Gene identiﬁers from various
sources, we attempt to select the common identiﬁers. If a concensus cannot be determined, we
select the smallest identiﬁer.

lumiRatAllENZYME2PROBE
Map between Enzyme Commission Numbers and Manufacturer Iden-
tiﬁers
Description
lumiRatAllENZYME2PROBE is an R object that maps Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers to
manufacturer identiﬁers.
Details
Each EC number maps to a named vector containing all of the manufacturer identiﬁers that cor-
respond to the gene that produces that enzyme. The name of the vector corresponds to the EC
number.
Enzyme Commission numbers are assigned by the Nomenclature Committee of the International
Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology http://www.chem.qmw.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/
to allow enzymes to be identiﬁed.
An Enzyme Commission number is of the format EC x.y.z.w, where x, y, z, and w are numeric num-
bers. In lumiRatAllENZYME2PROBE, EC is dropped from the Enzyme Commission numbers.
Enzyme Commission numbers have corresponding names that describe the functions of enzymes
in such a way that EC x is a more general description than EC x.y that in turn is a more general
description than EC x.y.z. The top level EC numbers and names are listed below:
EC 1 oxidoreductases
EC 2 transferases
EC 3 hydrolases
EC 4 lyases
EC 5 isomerases
EC 6 ligases

lumiRatAllGO2ALLPROBES
Map between Gene Ontology (GO) Identiﬁers and all Manufacturer
Identiﬁers in the subtree
Description
lumiRatAllGO2ALLPROBES is an R object that provides mappings between a given GO identiﬁer
and all manufactuerer identiﬁers annotated at that GO term or one of its children in the GO ontology.lumiRatAllGO2ALLPROBES 11
Details
GO consists of three ontologies—molecular function (MF), biological process (BP), and cellular
component (CC). All ontologies are structured as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Each node in
each DAG (tree) is a GO term (id) associated with a named vector of manufacturer identiﬁers.
The name associated with each manufacturer id corresponds to the evidence code for that GO
identiﬁer. This object lumiRatAllGO2ALLPROBES maps between a given GO identiﬁer and all
manufactuerer identiﬁers annotated at that GO term or one of its children in the GO ontology.
The evidence code indicates what kind of evidence supports the association between the GO and
Entrez Gene identiﬁers. Evidence codes currently in use include:
IMP - inferred from mutant phenotype
IGI - inferred from genetic interaction
IPI - inferred from physical interaction
ISS - inferred from sequence similarity
IDA - inferred from direct assay
IEP - inferred from expression pattern
IEA - inferred from electronic annotation
TAS - traceable author statement
NAS - non-traceable author statement
ND - no biological data available
IC - inferred by curator
A GO identiﬁer may be mapped to the same manufacturer identiﬁer more than once but the evidence
code can be different. Mappings between Gene Ontology identiﬁers and Gene Ontology terms and
other information are available in a separate data package named GO.

lumiRatAllGO Map between Manufacturer IDs and Gene Ontology (GO)
Description
lumiRatAllGO is an R object that provides mappings between manufacturer identiﬁers and the GO
identiﬁers that they are directly associated with.
Details
Each Entrez Gene identiﬁer is mapped to a list of lists. The names on the outer list are GO identi-
ﬁers. Each inner list consists of three named elements: GOID, Ontology, and Evidence.
The GOID element matches the GO identiﬁer named in the outer list and is included for convenience
when processing the data using ’lapply’.
The Ontology element indicates which of the three Gene Ontology categories this identiﬁer belongs
to. The categories are biological process (BP), cellular component (CC), and molecular function
(MF).
The Evidence element contains a code indicating what kind of evidence supports the association of
the GO identiﬁer to the Entrez Gene id. The evidence codes in use include:
IMP: inferred from mutant phenotype
IGI: inferred from genetic interaction
IPI: inferred from physical interaction
ISS: inferred from sequence similarity
IDA: inferred from direct assay
IEP: inferred from expression pattern
IEA: inferred from electronic annotation
TAS: traceable author statement
NAS: non-traceable author statement
ND: no biological data available
IC: inferred by curator
Mappings between probe identiﬁers and GO information were obtained through their mappings to
Entrez Gene identiﬁers. NAs are assigned to probe identiﬁers that can not be mapped to any Gene
Ontology information. Mappings between Gene Ontology identiﬁers an Gene Ontology terms and
other information are available in a separate data package named GO.

lumiRatAllMAPCOUNTS
Number of mapped keys for the maps in package lumiRatAll.db
Description
lumiRatAllMAPCOUNTS provides the "map count" (i.e. the count of mapped keys) for each map
in package lumiRatAll.db.
Details
This "map count" information is precalculated and stored in the package annotation DB. This allows
some quality control and is used by the checkMAPCOUNTS function deﬁned in AnnotationDbi
to compare and validate different methods (like count.mappedkeys(x) orsum(!is.na(as.list(x))) )
for getting the "map count" of a given map.

lumiRatAllORGANISM The Organism information for lumiRatAll
Description
lumiRatAllORGANISM is an R object that contains a single item: a character string that names
the organism for which lumiRatAll was built. lumiRatAllORGPKG is an R object that contains
a chararcter vector with the name of the organism package that a chip package depends on for its
gene-centric annotation.
Details
Although the package name is suggestive of the organism for which it was built, lumiRatAllOR-
GANISM provides a simple way to programmatically extract the organism name. lumiRatAllORG-
PKG provides a simple way to programmatically extract the name of the parent organism package.
The parent organism package is a strict dependency for chip packages as this is where the gene
cetric information is ultimately extracted from. The full package name will always be this string
plus the extension ".db". But most programatic acces will not require this extension, so its more
convenient to leave it out.

lumiRatAllPFAM Map Manufacturer IDs to Pfam IDs
Description
lumiRatAllPFAM is an R object that provides mappings between a manufacturer identiﬁer and the
associated Pfam identiﬁers.
Details
Each manufacturer identiﬁer maps to a named vector of Pfam identiﬁers. The name for each Pfam
identiﬁer is the IPI accession numbe where this Pfam identiﬁer is found.
If the Pfam is a named NA, it means that the associated Entrez Gene id of this manufacturer identiﬁer
is found in an IPI entry of the IPI database, but there is no Pfam identiﬁer in the entry.
If the Pfam is a non-named NA, it means that the associated Entrez Gene id of this manufacturer
identiﬁer is not found in any IPI entry of the IPI database.

by that PubMed identiﬁer. The length of the vector may be one or longer, depending on how many
manufacturer identiﬁers are mapped to a given PubMed identiﬁer.
Titles, abstracts, and possibly full texts of articles can be obtained from PubMed by providing a
valid PubMed identiﬁer. The pubmed function of annotate can also be used for the same purpose

lumiRatAllPMID Map between Manufacturer Identiﬁers and PubMed Identiﬁers
Description
lumiRatAllPMID is an R object that provides mappings between manufacturer identiﬁers and PubMed
identiﬁers.
Details
Each manufacturer identiﬁer is mapped to a named vector of PubMed identiﬁers. The name asso-
ciated with each vector corresponds to the manufacturer identiﬁer. The length of the vector may
be one or greater, depending on how many PubMed identiﬁers a given manufacturer identiﬁer is
mapped to. An NAis reported for any manufacturer identiﬁer that cannot be mapped to a PubMed
identiﬁer.
Titles, abstracts, and possibly full texts of articles can be obtained from PubMed by providing a
valid PubMed identiﬁer. The pubmed function of annotate can also be used for the same purpose.

lumiRatAllPROSITE Map Manufacturer IDs to PROSITE ID
Description
lumiRatAllPROSITE is an R object that provides mappings between a manufacturer identiﬁer and
the associated PROSITE identiﬁers.
Details
Each manufacturer identiﬁer maps to a named vector of PROSITE identiﬁers. The name for each
PROSITE identiﬁer is the IPI accession numbe where this PROSITE identiﬁer is found.
If the PROSITE is a named NA, it means that the associated Entrez Gene id of this manufacturer
identiﬁer is found in an IPI entry of the IPI database, but there is no PROSITE identiﬁer in the entry.
If the PROSITE is a non-named NA, it means that the associated Entrez Gene id of this manufacturer
identiﬁer is not found in any IPI entry of the IPI database.

lumiRatAllREFSEQ Map between Manufacturer Identiﬁers and RefSeq Identiﬁers
Description
lumiRatAllREFSEQ is an R object that provides mappings between manufacturer identiﬁers and
RefSeq identiﬁers.lumiRatAllSYMBOL 21
Details
Each manufacturer identiﬁer is mapped to a named vector of RefSeq identiﬁers. The name repre-
sents the manufacturer identiﬁer and the vector contains all RefSeq identiﬁers that can be mapped
to that manufacturer identiﬁer. The length of the vector may be one or greater, depending on how
many RefSeq identiﬁers a given manufacturer identiﬁer can be mapped to. An NAis reported for
any manufacturer identiﬁer that cannot be mapped to a RefSeq identiﬁer at this time.
RefSeq identiﬁers differ in format according to the type of record the identiﬁers are for as shown
below:
NG\_XXXXX: RefSeq accessions for genomic region (nucleotide) records
NM\_XXXXX: RefSeq accessions for mRNA records
NC\_XXXXX: RefSeq accessions for chromosome records
NP\_XXXXX: RefSeq accessions for protein records
XR\_XXXXX: RefSeq accessions for model RNAs that are not associated with protein products
XM\_XXXXX: RefSeq accessions for model mRNA records
XP\_XXXXX: RefSeq accessions for model protein records
Where XXXXX is a sequence of integers.
NCBIhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/ allows users to query the RefSeq database using
RefSeq identiﬁers.

lumiRatAllSYMBOL Map between Manufacturer Identiﬁers and Gene Symbols
Description
lumiRatAllSYMBOL is an R object that provides mappings between manufacturer identiﬁers and
gene abbreviations.22 lumiRatAllUNIGENE
Details
Each manufacturer identiﬁer is mapped to an abbreviation for the corresponding gene. An NAis
reported if there is no known abbreviation for a given gene.
Symbols typically consist of 3 letters that deﬁne either a single gene (ABC) or multiple genes
(ABC1, ABC2, ABC3). Gene symbols can be used as key words to query public databases such as
Entrez Gene.

lumiRatAllUNIGENE Map between Manufacturer Identiﬁers and UniGene cluster identiﬁers
Description
lumiRatAllUNIGENE is an R object that provides mappings between manufacturer identiﬁers and
UniGene identiﬁers.
Details
Each manufacturer identiﬁer is mapped to a UniGene identiﬁer. An NAis reported if the manufac-
turer identiﬁer cannot be mapped to UniGene at this time.
A UniGene identiﬁer represents a cluster of sequences of a gene. Using UniGene identiﬁers one
can query the UniGene database for information about the sequences or the Entrez Gene database
for information about the genes.
