1. Introduction
The identiÔ¨Åcation of substances capable of induc-
ing mutations has become an important procedure insafety assessment. Chemicals that can induce muta-tions can potentially damage the germ line leading tofertility problems and to mutations in future genera-tions. Mutagenic chemicals are also capable of induc-ing cancer, and this concern has driven most of themutagenicity testing programs. Mutations can occur

tions that leave the bacteria unable to synthesize the
requiredaminoacid,histidine,andthereforeunabletogrowandformcoloniesinitsabsence.Newmutationsat the site of these preexisting mutations, or nearby inthe genes, can restore the gene‚Äôs function and allowthe cells to synthesize histidine. These newly mutatedcells can grow in the absence of histidine and formcolonies. For this reason, the test is often referred toas a ‚Äúreversion assay.‚Äù
TheSalmonella strains used in the test have differ-
entmutationsinvariousgenesinthehistidineoperon;each of these mutations is designed to be responsiveto mutagens that act via different mechanisms. Ad-ditional mutations were engineered into these strainsto make them more sensitive to a wide variety ofsubstances.
TheSalmonella mutagenicity test was speciÔ¨Åcally
designed to detect chemically induced mutagenesis[7]. Over the years its value as such has been recog-nizedbythescientiÔ¨Åccommunity,andbygovernmentagenciesandcorporations.Thetestisusedworld-wideas an initial screen to determine the mutagenic po-tential of new chemicals and drugs because there is ahigh predictive value for rodent carcinogenicity whena mutagenic response is obtained [49,71,85,92]. In-ternational guidelines have also been developed (e.g.,Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Devel-opment (OECD); International Commission on Har-monization (ICH)) for use by corporations and testinglaboratoriestoensureuniformityoftestingproceduresprior to submission of data to regulatory agencies forregistration or acceptance of many chemicals, includ-ing drugs and biocides.
2. Historical aspects
The Ames Salmonella /microsome mutagenicity as-
sayevolvedovertheyearsfromtheinitialscreeningofa number of histidine mutants which led to the selec-tion of mutants that were highly sensitive to reversionby a variety of chemical mutagens [2,5,39,40,47].Because bacteria are unable to metabolize chemicalsvia cytochromes P450, as in mammals and othervertebrates, a key component for making the bacte-rial mutagenicity test useful was the inclusion of anexogenous mammalian metabolic activation system[6,43]. At the same time, the development of the plateincorporation assay protocol to replace spot test or
liquid suspension procedures was a major contribut-ing factor to the success of the Ames test becauseit made the test easier to perform and reduced itscost.
2.1. Screening of histidine mutants and development
of the plate incorporation assay
Studies performed to identify and map the genes
responsible for histidine biosynthesis produceda large number of spontaneous, radiation-, andchemical-induced histidine mutants of Salmonella
typhimurium LT-2 [27,82]. Some of the mutants con-
tained single base changes (base-pair substitutionmutants), and others contained additions or dele-tions of one or more bases (frameshift mutants). Itwas later realized that some of these mutant strainscould be used to identify and characterize muta-genic chemicals by their ability to revert to wild-type(histidine-independence)inthepresenceofmutagens.In 1966, Ames and WhitÔ¨Åeld [4] proposed a set ofhistidine mutant strains for screening chemicals formutagens using a spot test procedure that was previ-ously used by Szybalski [72] and Iyer and Szybalski[34] for mutagen screening with an E. colistrain. The
spot test consists of applying a small amount of thetest chemical directly to the center of a selective agarmedium plate seeded with the test organism. As thechemical diffuses into the agar a concentration gradi-entisformed.Amutagenicchemicalwillgiverisetoaring of revertant colonies surrounding the area wherethe chemical was applied. If the chemical is toxic,a zone of growth inhibition will also be observed[2]. Fig. 1 depicts a spot test with methylmethanesulfonate and strain Salmonella strain TA100.
In1973,Amesetal.[5,6]developedtheplateincor-
poration assay procedure which is more sensitive andquantitative than the spot test. The procedure consistsof adding the buffer or S-9 mix, the histidine depen-dent bacteria (about 10
8) and test chemical to 2 ml
of top agar containing biotin and a trace amount ofhistidine (0.05 mM each). The mixture is then gen-tly mixed and poured on glucose minimal (GM) agarplates. When the top agar has solidiÔ¨Åed the plates areincubated in an inverted position in a 37
C incubator
for 48 h at which time the histidine revertant coloniesarecounted.TheassayprocedureisdepictedinFig.2.K. Mortelmans, E. Zeiger/Mutation Research 455 (2000) 29‚Äì60 31
Fig. 1. Spot test with strain TA100 and methyl methanesulfonate

Fig. 2. Diagram depicting the steps involved in the plate incorporation assay.When the histidine dependent bacteria are grown
on a glucose minimal (GM) agar plate containing atrace amount of histidine, only those cells that re-vert to histidine independence (His
C) are able to form
colonies. The small amount of histidine allows all theplatedbacteriatoundergoafewcelldivisions;inmanycases, this growth is essential for mutagenesis to oc-cur. The His
Crevertants are easily scored as colonies
against the slight background growth. The number ofspontaneously induced revertant colonies is relativelyconstant for each strain. However, when a mutagen isadded to the plate, the number of revertant coloniesperplateisincreased,usuallyinadoserelatedmanneras depicted in Fig. 3.

bacteria to the plate, it is not possible to estimate the
numberofcellsatriskformutation.Therefore,themu-tation values obtained can only be expressed as num-ber of mutants/plate, or number of mutants/amount ofchemical added.
A plate test that can provide quantitative toxicity
information is the ‚Äútreat-and-plate‚Äù suspension proce-dure but takes longer to perform than the plate incor-poration assay. In this procedure, the bacteria are
washed free of growth medium, resuspended innon-nutrient growth medium and treated with thetest substance for various time intervals. Separatesamples of the bacteria are then plated on selectivemedium for mutant determination and on completemedium for survival determination. The results estab-lishthemutationfrequencybycalculatingthenumberK. Mortelmans, E. Zeiger/Mutation Research 455 (2000) 29‚Äì60 33
of mutants per surviving fraction of bacteria [26].
However, the plate incorporation assay offers the ad-vantages that limited steps are required to expose thebacteria to the test chemical with no need for washingor resuspending the bacteria prior to or after treat-ment. In addition, the bacteria are allowed to undergoa few cell divisions in the presence of the test sub-stance, which increases their sensitivity to mutationinduction.
2.2. Metabolic activation systems2.2.1. Oxidative metabolism
Some carcinogenic chemicals, such aromatic
amines or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, arebiologically inactive unless they are metabolizedto active forms. In humans and lower animals, thecytochrome-based P450 metabolic oxidation sys-tem, which is present mainly in the liver and to alesser extent in the lung and kidneys, is capable ofmetabolizing a large number of these chemicals toDNA-reactive, electrophilic forms. Some of the in-termediate metabolites are potent mutagens in theAmesSalmonella assay. Since bacteria do not have
this metabolic capability, an exogenous mammalianorgan activation system needs to be added to the petriplate together with the test chemical and the bacteria.For this purpose, a rodent metabolic activation systemwas introduced into the test system [5,22,43,51,69].The metabolic activation system usually consistsof a 9000 gsupernatant fraction of a rat liver ho-
mogenate (S-9 microsomal fraction), which is deli-vered to the test system in the presence of NADP andcofactors for NADPH-supported oxidation (S-9 mix)[47]. To increase the level of metabolizing enzymes,the animals are pretreated with the mixed-functionoxidase inducer Aroclor 1254. Other inducers, suchas phenobarbital and b-naphthoÔ¨Çavone, can also be
used.
The mixed function oxidase enzymes (S-9 fraction)
can also be obtained from animal species other thanrat such as mouse, hamster, guinea-pig and monkeyand organs other than liver such as kidney [1,31,48]and from human liver [66]. In comparative studiesin which coded compounds were tested, induced anduninduced Syrian hamster or mouse liver S-9 offeredno overall advantage over Aroclor-1254 induced ratliver S-9 for the induction of mutagenesis [17,18,29].However, there are chemicals that may be more efÔ¨Å-
ciently detected as mutagens with rat, mouse, or ham-ster liver S-9 [17,18,90].
2.2.2. Reductive metabolism
The metabolic activation system can also consist
of a reductive enzyme system for classes of chem-icals containing azo and diazo bonds. Reductionof chemical substances can occur in mammals, in-cluding humans, by anaerobic intestinal microÔ¨Çora,and very likely by mammalian reductases in the in-testinal wall or in the liver. Two types of reductivein vitro metabolic activation systems have gener-ally been used, those based on a liver homogenatesupplemented with FMN [58,59], and those thatare based on rat intestinal microÔ¨Çora preparations[62‚Äì64].

TA1535 and TA1538 resulting in the correspond-ing isogenic strains TA100 and TA98 [7] and instrains TA97 [39] and TA102 and TA104 [40]. Plas-mid pKM101 enhances chemical and UV-inducedmutagenesis via an increase in the error-prone re-combinational DNA repair pathway [50,65,80]. Theplasmid confers ampicillin resistance, which is a con-venient marker to detect the presence of the plasmid[53].

2.3.2. SpeciÔ¨Åc target DNA sequence
Table 2 lists the DNA sequences of the target
mutations in the commonly used Salmonella tester
strains. The hisG46marker in strains TA1535 and
TA100 results from the substitution of a leucine(GAG/CTC) by a proline (GGG/CCC) [11]. Thismutation is reverted to the wild-type state by mu-tagens that cause base-pair substitution mutationsprimarily at one of the GC pairs. The hisD3052 mu-
tation carried by strains TA1538 and TA98 is a -1frameshift mutation which affects the reading frameof a nearby repetitive ‚ÄìC‚ÄìG‚ÄìC‚ÄìG‚ÄìC‚ÄìG‚ÄìC‚ÄìG‚Äì se-quence [33]. Reversion of the hisD3052 mutation
back to the wild-type state is induced by variousframeshift mutagens such as 2-nitroÔ¨Çuorene andvarious aromatic nitroso derivatives of amine car-cinogens. Strain TA1537 which carries the hisC3076
mutation appears to have a C1 frameshift mutationK. Mortelmans, E. Zeiger/Mutation Research 455 (2000) 29‚Äì60 35
near the site of a repetitive ‚ÄìC‚ÄìC‚ÄìC‚Äì sequence and
is reverted to the wild-type level by frameshift mu-tagens that are not readily detected by the hisD3052
marker, such as 9-aminoacridine [5]. The hisD6610
mutation in strain TA97 also carries a C1 frameshift
mutation (cytosine) resulting in a run of 6 cytosines(‚ÄìC‚ÄìC‚ÄìC‚ÄìC‚ÄìC‚ÄìC‚Äì). This strain is believed to bemore sensitive than TA1537 to frameshift mutagens,and, unlike strain TA1537, is sensitive to some ofthe mutagens that revert strains TA1538 and TA98[39].
It should be noted that the DNA target sites of
the above described tester strains contain GC basepairs. In contrast, two additional strains TA102 andTA104 were developed that contain AT base pairs atthehisG428 mutant site. The mutation is carried on
the multi-copy plasmid pAQ1 in strain TA102 andon the chromosome in strain TA104. The plasmidconfers tetracycline resistance, which is a convenientmarker to detect the presence of the plasmid. ThehisG428mutation is an ochre mutation, TAA, in the
hisGgene which can be reverted by all six possible
base-pair changes; both transitions and transversions.This mutation is also reverted by mutagens that causeoxidative damage. In addition, the DNA repair pro-Ô¨Åcient strain TA102 detects cross-linking agents suchas bleomycin and mitomycin C [40].
2.4. Construction of base-speciÔ¨Åc Salmonella tester
strains
Asetof6base-speciÔ¨Åc Salmonella testerstrainswas
developedbyGeeetal.[24],withtheuniquepropertythat each strain can be reverted by a unique transitionor transversion event thereby enabling the identiÔ¨Åca-tion of speciÔ¨Åc base-pair substitutions. In addition tothehismutation all strains carry the following genetic
markers:therfamutation that affects the permeability of the
cell wall
theuvrB-bio deletion that affects the accurate DNA
repair pathway and which makes the cells biotindependent
the mutagenesis-enhancing plasmid pKM101.
Each strain carries a unique missense mutation
with the base change indicated below in the histidinebiosynthetic operon:Strain Operon Mutation

TA7005 hisG9130 CG to AT
TA7006 hisC9070 CG to GC
The results of a validation study were published by
Gee et al. [25].
2.4.1. ModiÔ¨Åcations of the standard plate
incorporation assay
Over the years, modiÔ¨Åcations to the standard plate
incorporation assay (Fig. 2) have been developed bydifferent researchers that enhanced the sensitivity ofthe test and allowed the testing of a wider range ofchemicals, including gases and volatile chemicals.ThemostcommonlyusedmodiÔ¨Åcationsaredescribedbelow.
2.4.2. The preincubation assay
In the preincubation assay, the tester strains are ex-
posed to the chemical for a short period (20 to 30min)inasmallvolume(0.5ml)ofeitherbufferorS-9mix,priortoplatingonglucoseagarminimalmedium(GM agar) supplemented with a trace amount of his-tidine. With few exceptions it is believed that this as-say is more sensitive than the plate incorporation as-say, because short-lived mutagenic metabolites mayhave a better chance reacting with the tester strainsin the small volume of preincubation mixture, andthe effective concentration of S-9 mix in the preincu-bation volume is higher than on the plate [29,55,84,89,90].
2.4.3. The desiccator assay for volatile liquids and
gases
The use of a closed chamber is recommended
for testing highly volatile chemicals and gases[8,30,67,91].
2.4.4. The Kado Salmonella microsuspension assay
for testing small sample volumes
This procedure was designed to detect mutagenic
metabolites in urine samples obtained from animalstreated with test chemicals [35] because of the rela-tively small sample volumes obtained in these stud-36 K. Mortelmans, E. Zeiger/Mutation Research 455 (2000) 29‚Äì60
ies. In this procedure, the overnight cultures are cen-
trifuged to obtain a 10-fold higher than normal celldensity(i.e.,about1to2 10
10bacteriaperml,which
results in about 1 to 2 109bacteria per tube when
delivered in a 0.1 ml inoculum) for use in the prein-cubation assay. The exposure of a higher number ofbacteria to the urine samples is believed to enhancethedetectionofmutagenicmetabolitespresentinurinesamples. This procedure is also well suited for testingsmall quantities (about 20 mg) of samples where thesample quantities are limited, and for testing complexmixtures other than urine samples.
2.4.5. Testing of chemicals in a reduced oxygen
atmosphere
Anaerobic environments, such as anaerobic cham-
bers, have been used to study mutagenicity of chem-icals and fecal samples under reduced oxygen levels[14,28,41,54,74,75]. Highly reduced oxygen levelsmay lead to a reduction in both spontaneous and in-duced revertant colonies and may interfere with theinterpretation of the results. A complete absence ofrevertant colonies is observed when a strict anaer-obic environment and prereduced and anaerobicallysterilized (PRAS) media are used [54]. It is there-fore important to perform preliminary experiments todetermine whether the spontaneous reversion rate isaffected by the intended reduced oxygen level.
2.5. Validation studies
Over the years, many validation studies have
been performed to determine the reproducibility oftest results on an intra- and inter-laboratory level[17,18,45,57,61,77,85]. In addition, many studieshave been performed to determine the sensitivity andcorrelation of the Ames test with animal carcino-genicity studies. It has indeed been established thatthere is a high predictivity of a positive mutagenicresponse in the Ames test for rodent carcinogenicity[3,49,71,73,88], ranging from 90% [49] to 77% [88],the primary differences being the chemical compo-sition of the compiled databases. The test thereforeis in many instances used as a Ô¨Årst screen to deter-mine the mutagenic potential of new chemicals anddrugs. In addition, data from the test is submittedto regulatory agencies in support of registration oracceptance of many chemicals, including drugs andbiocides [9,21,38,68]. International guidelines have
been developed for use by corporations and testinglaboratoriestoensureuniformityoftestingprocedures[32,56].
3. Long term storage and propagation of the
tester strains
3.1. Preparation of frozen permanent cultures
For long-term preservation, the Salmonella tester
strains should be kept frozen at ‚àí80
C (freezer or
liquid nitrogen). Upon receipt of the new strains, upto Ô¨Åve frozen permanent cultures should be preparedfrom one single colony isolate that has been puriÔ¨Åedand checked for its genotypic characteristics ( his,rfa,
uvrB-bio) and for the presence of plasmids pKM101
and pAQ1, when appropriate. These cultures shouldbeconsideredthefrozenpermanentstrainsandshouldbe accessed only for the preparation of new frozenworking cultures or master agar plates.
If the new strain is received on a small sterile Ô¨Ålter
disk embedded in nutrient agar, Ô¨Årst wipe the diskacross the surface of a nutrient agar plate, and thentransfer the disk to 5 ml of nutrient broth. If the straincomesasalyophilizedculture,asepticallyadd1mlofnutrientbrothtorehydratetheculture(aprocesswhichshould take up to 2 min), then transfer the rehydratedculture to 4 ml of nutrient broth. Keep a drop of therehydrated culture for transfer to a nutrient agar plateandstreaktheinoculumforindividualcoloniesacrossthe surface of the plate. The broth culture serves asa back-up in case no growth is observed on the agarplate.
Afterovernightincubationat37
C,inspecttheagar
platesforgrowth.Ifsinglecoloniesareobserved,pickone healthy looking colony and restreak it for indi-vidual colonies on GM agar plate supplemented withan excess of biotin and histidine, and with ampicillinand tetracycline (for the strain(s) carrying plasmidpKM101and pAQ1, respectively). This puriÔ¨Åcationstep should be repeated. At least two puriÔ¨Åcationsteps are recommended to ensure that a pure culturewill be used for propagation of the frozen permanentcultures.
Note: For puriÔ¨Åcation purposes nutrient agar plates
may be used instead of appropriately supplementedK. Mortelmans, E. Zeiger/Mutation Research 455 (2000) 29‚Äì60 37
GM agar plates; however, the use of minimal de-
Ô¨Åned medium reduces the risk of contamination. Ittakes 2 days of incubation at 37
C to obtain good
growth on GM agar plates. The supplemental nu-trients and antibiotics can be applied directly tothe surface of the GM plates by delivering two tothree drops of the appropriate solutions (see theSection 15: Recipes for reagents and media) whichare then evenly distributed over the agar surface bya sterile glass spreader. These solutions can alsobe incorporated in the agar when the plates areprepared.Pick up to Ô¨Åve single colonies from the second (or
later) puriÔ¨Åcation plate and transfer to a preassignedlocation on a GM agar plate supplemented with theappropriate nutrient/antibiotics which will serve asthe master plates during the process of preparing thepermanent frozen cultures. For convenience, label thelocations, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, on the backs of the plates.Incubate the master plates for 2 days at 37
C. When
good growth is observed, inoculate 5 ml of nutrientbroth with a small inoculum from each of the singleisolated colonies on the master plate. After overnightincubation at 37
C conÔ¨Årm the genotypes (strain
check) of the tester strains (see the section: Geneticanalysis).
Upon completion of the strain check, select the
colony from the master plate that has given the bestoverall results in terms of phenotypic characteris-tics, including the best overall spontaneous mutationinduction. Transfer a small inoculum in 4.5 ml ofnutrient broth and incubate overnight at 37
C with
shaking till the cells reach a density of 1 to 2 109
CFU/ml (O.D. 540between 0.1 and 0.2). Add 0.5
ml of a sterile cryopreservative such as glycerolor DMSO to the culture (Ô¨Ånal concentration, 10%,v/v), mix thoroughly and dispense 1 ml aliquotsin sterile cryogenic tubes prelabelled ‚ÄúPERMA-NENT CULTURES‚Äù with strain number and dateof preparation. Quick freeze on dry ice and store at‚àí80
C.

New frozen working cultures should be prepared at
leastevery12monthswithanexpirationdateof1yearfrom the time the frozen working cultures were pre-pared. For preparation of the working cultures, scrapethesurfaceofonefrozenpermanentculturewithaster-ile wooden applicator stick or inoculation loop. Thisprocedureshouldbedonequicklytopreventthefrozenpermanent culture from thawing which might resultin decreased viability and loss of plasmid(s). Inoc-ulate 5 ml of nutrient broth with the small inocu-lum. After overnight incubation at 37
C with shaking
(100‚Äì120rpm),streakaloopfulofthecultureforindi-vidual colonies on GM agar plates supplemented withan excess of biotin and histidine, and as needed withampicillin and tetracycline, for the strain(s) carryingplasmid pKM101and pAQ1, respectively. Purify onehealthy looking colony at least twice.
Pick up to Ô¨Åve single colonies from the second pu-
riÔ¨Åcation plate and transfer to a preassigned locationonaGMagarplatesupplementedwiththeappropriatenutrient/antibiotics; this will be considered the mas-ter plate. All subsequent steps are identical to thosedescribed above for the preparation of the frozenpermanent cultures except for the following. Thecryogenic tubes should be prelabelled: WORKINGCULTURES, with strain number, date of preparationand expiration date and more than 5 frozen culturesshould be prepared (see Note below).
Note: It is recommended that one frozen working
culture(onecryogenictube)beusedforeachexper-imentandthattheunusedportionbediscarded.Fre-quent rethawing and refreezing of the tester strainsmay result in reduced viability and loss of the plas-mid(s). It is therefore important to prepare sufÔ¨Å-cient frozen working cultures for 1 year. However,if needed, frozen working cultures can be preparedseveral times a year. It is important that the Ô¨Ånalconcentration of the cryopreservative, glycerol orDMSO, is at least 10%, v/v.
3.3. Preparation of working stock agar plates
In case there is a problem maintaining frozen
working cultures, working stock agar plates can beprepared by streaking appropriately supplementedGM agar plates with the tester strains after a strain38 K. Mortelmans, E. Zeiger/Mutation Research 455 (2000) 29‚Äì60
check. These plates should be stored in the refrige-
rator wrapped in paraÔ¨Ålm to prevent dehydration ofthe agar. For inoculation purposes, a small inoculum,preferably from an area of conÔ¨Çuent growth insteadof a single colony, should be used to inoculate the nu-trient broth. The plates can be stored up to 2 months,except for the plate containing strain TA102 whichcan only be stored for 2 weeks because the number ofspontaneous revertant colonies increases over time.This may be due to the generation of a higher copynumber of plasmid pAQ1 and does not appear to bean indication of tetracycline mutagenicity [40,47].Therefore, it is recommended that frozen workingcultures, rather than working agar plates, be preparedfor strain TA102.
3.4. Growing overnight cultures
For each experiment, the tester strain cultures are
grown overnight in Oxoid nutrient broth No. 2 to adensity of 1‚Äì2 10
9colony forming units (CFU)/ml.
The volume of the cultures will depend on the size ofthe experiment but is usually between 10 and 50 ml.Care should be taken that the size of the culture Ô¨ÇaskbeatleastthreetoÔ¨Åvetimesthevolumeoftheculturemedium to ensure adequate aeration.
Individual culture Ô¨Çasks are inoculated with each
strain. When using frozen stock cultures, allow theculturetothawatroomtemperature.Aliquotsbetween0.1 and 0.5 ml are then transferred into nutrient brothwith volumes between 10 and 50 ml, respectively,which gives an initial cell density between 10
6and
107CFU/ml (1:100 dilution). The remainder of the
workingcultureshouldbediscarded,becausefrequentthawing and refreezing of the frozen cultures resultsinpermanentinjurytothebacteria.Overnightculturesmay also be inoculated with a small inoculum takenfrom a working stock agar plate.
The freshly inoculated cultures are placed on a
shakerinthedarkatroomtemperaturefo r4hwithout
shaking, then gently shaken (100 rpm) for 11‚Äì14 h at37
C. The use of a timer is convenient for following
this procedure. The next morning the cultures areremoved from the incubator and kept at room tempe-rature away from direct Ô¨Çuorescent light by wrappingthem in aluminum foil. This precautionary procedureis not required if the laboratories are equipped withyelloworredoverheadlights.Someinvestigatorskeepthe cultures on ice to prevent loss of viability of the
rfastrains which will occur if they are maintained for
an extended period of time at room temperature in thenutrient broth. However, to prevent thermal shock tothe bacteria when they are added to the 43
Ct o4 8C
top agar, it is best to leave the cultures at room tem-peratureduringthecourseofthemutagenicitytesting.
4. Genetic analysis
It is recommended that the tester strains be an-
alyzed for their genetic integrity and spontaneousmutation rate when frozen cultures are prepared. Astrain check should also be performed whenever anexperiment is performed. The strain check is usuallyperformed with the nutrient broth overnight culturesin the following way.
The following steps should be followed for a com-
plete strain check.
Histidine dependence ( hishishis):streak a loopful of
the culture across a GM agar plate supplemented withanexcessofbiotin.Becauseallthe Salmonella strains
are histidine dependent, there should be no growth onthe plates.
Biotin dependence ( biobiobio):streak a loopful of the
culture across a GM agar plate supplemented with anexcess of histidine. There should be no growth on theplateexceptforstrainTA102whichisbiotinindepen-dent.
Biotin and histidine dependence ( bio; hisbio; hisbio; his):
streak a loopful of the culture across a GM agar platesupplemented with an excess of biotin and histidine.Growth should be observed with all strains.
rf arf arf amarker: streakaloopfulofthecultureacross
aGMagarplatesupplementedwithanexcessofbiotinand histidine. Place a sterile Ô¨Ålter paper disk in thecenter of the streak and apply 10 ml of a sterile 0.1%
crystal violet solution. All Salmonella strains should
showazoneofgrowthinhibitionsurroundingthedisk.
Note:Thecrystalvioletdiskscanbepreparedinad-
vanceandstoredatroomtemperature.Nutrientagarplates can be substituted for the GM agar plates.
uvrBuvrBuvrBdeletion: because the deletion mutation
stretches across the bio-uvrB region of the chromo-
some and cannot revert to wild-type, it is sufÔ¨Åcient toshow that the tester strains are biotin dependent (seeK. Mortelmans, E. Zeiger/Mutation Research 455 (2000) 29‚Äì60 39
above) to infer that they are also defective in the ac-
curate DNA repair pathway due to the uvrBdeletion.
Presence of plasmid pKM101 (ampicillin re-
sistance): streak a loopful of the pKM101-carrying
Salmonella culture across a GM agar plate supple-
mented with an excess of histidine and biotin and24 mg/ml ampicillin. Alternatively, a sterile 6-mm Ô¨Ål-
ter paper disk containing 10 mg/ml ampicillin can be
placed on a streak of the strain on the GM agar platesupplemented with histidine and biotin. As a control,a strain should be included that does not carry plas-mid pKM101. Growth should be observed only withstrains carrying pKM101.
Note: The ampicillin disks can be prepared in ad-
vance and stored in the refrigerator.
Presence of plasmid pAQ1 (Tetracycline resis-
tance): streak a loopful of a TA102 overnight culture
across a GM agar plate supplemented with an excessof histidine and biotin, and 2 mg/ml tetracycline. Al-
ternatively, a sterile 6-mm Ô¨Ålter paper disk containing2mg/ml tetracycline can be placed on a streak of the
strain on the GM agar plate supplemented with his-tidine (biotin is not required for growth of TA102).However, there is no problem using GM agar platessupplementedwithbothhistidineandbiotin.Asacon-trol, a strain should be included that does not carryplasmid pAQ1 plasmid. Growth should be observedwith strain TA102 which is the only strain that carriesplasmid pAQ1.
Note: The tetracycline disks can be prepared in ad-
vance and stored in the refrigerator.
Spontaneous mutant frequency: use the stan-
dard plate incorporation assay procedure (see below)without the inclusion of a solvent for determining thespontaneous mutant frequency (negative control) ofeach of the tester strains. When the spontaneous con-trol values fall outside an acceptable historical range(see Table 3) the genetic integrity of the strain(s) isconsideredcompromised,andanewcultureshouldbeisolated. There may be non-strain related reasons fora spontaneous value that is too high or too low (seeTroubleshooting, below). These should be consideredbefore a new culture is isolated.
If one or more of the above strain checks fails, the
culture is considered unacceptable for use. If such aculture was used for performing an experiment, theresults should be considered invalid and the experi-
ment should be repeated. In case the strain check wasperformed when the strains were frozen (permanentorworkingcultures)andyieldedunacceptableresults,the strain(s) should be reisolated following the proce-dures outlined above.
Note: For routine genetic analysis when experi-
ments are performed, the modiÔ¨Åed procedure de-scribed by Zeiger et al. [94] may be used insteadof the more lengthy procedure described above.
5. Spontaneous control values
Each tester strain has a characteristic spontaneous
mutant frequency. There is usually some day-to-dayand laboratory-to-laboratory variation in the numberof spontaneous revertant colonies. Choice of solventmay also affect the spontaneous mutant frequency[46]. Each laboratory has a characteristic range ofrevertant colonies for each strain which is referredto as ‚Äúhistorical control values‚Äù. The spontaneousmutant frequency obtained when the strain check isperformed should be compared to the laboratory‚Äôshistorical control values. Table 3 presents a rangeof spontaneous histidine revertant (negative solvent)control values per plate with and without metabolicactivation considered valid in the authors‚Äô labora-tories. The values obtained in the presence of ametabolic activation system includes both rat andhamster liver S-9. The spontaneous values presentedfor S-9 were from 10% S-9 in the S-9 mix. Some ofthe strains (e.g., TA97, TA102, TA104) are highlysensitive to S-9 concentrations and their spontaneousreversion values will increase with the S-9 concentra-

tion. Other acceptable ranges of background revertant
counts have been published [7,37,47].
6. Toxicity determination
Toxicity determination in the Ames Salmonella test
requires the evaluation of characteristics of the Ô¨Ånalpopulation on the GM agar plate after the 48-h incu-bationinsteadofaquantitativesurvivaldetermination.These characteristics are:thinning of the background lawn which may be ac-
companiedbyadecreaseinthenumberofrevertantcolonies
absenceofbackgroundlawn(i.e.,completeabsence
of growth)
presence of pinpoint non-revertant colonies (gener-
ally in conjunction with an absence of backgroundlawn)The overnight Salmonella nutrient broth cultures
largely consist of histidine-dependent bacteria withjust a few pre-existing histidine-independent (His
C)
bacteria that arose during the overnight incubation.The addition of a small amount of histidine to thetop agar allows all the plated bacteria (approximately110
8cells)toundergobetweensixandeightcelldi-
vision before the histidine is depleted. In many cases,this limited growth is essential for mutagenesis to oc-curbyallowingÔ¨Åxationofthemutationallesions.Thepre-existing His
Cbacteria as well as the HisCrever-
tantsthataroseontheplate(platerevertants)willcon-tinue to grow in the absence of histidine and will giverise to visible colonies. These His
Ccolonies are eas-
ily scored against a slightly hazy looking backgroundlawn which is made up of the microcolonies of thehistidine-dependent bacteria.
Microscopic (40 ) examination of the background
lawn in the absence of toxicity will reveal the pre-sence of densely packed microcolonies which form auniform, though somewhat granular thin Ô¨Ålm. In suchcases, all the plated histidine-dependent bacteria wereable to undergo six to eight cell divisions. However,when a chemical is toxic there may be ‚Äúthinning‚Äù orcomplete absence of the background lawn comparedto the negative or solvent control. Partial toxicity ofthechemicalwillgiverisetothinningsincenotalltheplated bacteria were killed or had their growth inhi-bited. In this case, the surviving bacteria still formmicrocolonies but they are not densely packed and
may appear as single sparsely spaced microcolonieswhich results in the ‚Äúthinning‚Äù effect; these colonieswill not be visible to the naked eye. A decrease in thenumberofrevertantcoloniestolevelsbelowthespon-taneous reversion level may on occasion be seen withthinning. A complete absence of background lawn in-dicatesahighleveloftoxicitywiththeinabilityofthebacteria to grow and form a lawn. Such a toxic doseshould not be used.
Occasionally numerous small non-revertant
colonies are present on the plate. The colonies arereferred to as ‚Äúpinpoint colonies‚Äù and consist ofhistidine-dependentbacteriathatsurvivedhighchemi-cal toxicity. These colonies are readily visible by thenakedeyeandmaybemistakenforrevertantcolonies.Microscopic inspection of the plates will, however,reveal that there is a total absence of backgroundlawn. The pinpoint colonies arise due to the fact thatthe high level of toxicity resulted in more histidinebeingavailabletothesurvivingHis
‚àíbacteriaonaper
cell basis. Therefore, these bacteria can undergo addi-tionalcelldivisionsuntilthedepletionofthehistidine.The histidine dependency can be readily checked bystreaking a few pinpoint colonies on GM agar platessupplemented with biotin but without histidine in theabsence of the test chemical. A preliminary toxicityexperiment is usually performed to determine the topdose that can be tested (see Dose selection, below).
It is important that the same number of bacteria be
used in the preliminary toxicity assay as well as inthedeÔ¨Ånitivemutagenicityassay.Dilutionofthetesterstraintoplate <1000cellstoenableaquantitativetox-
icity determination could lead to an erroneous result.On a per cell basis, more chemical would be availabletoeachbacteriumthanwouldbeavailableif1‚Äì2 10

bacteria are exposed to the substance, as happens in
the deÔ¨Ånitive mutagenicity test procedure [79].
7. Minimal deÔ¨Åned agar medium
7.1. Top agar
The top agar, consisting of 0.6% agar and 0.6%
NaCl, is one of the most critical medium componentsintheAmestestbecauseitcontainsthetraceamountofhistidine(0.05mM)forlimitedgrowth.ItalsocontainsK. Mortelmans, E. Zeiger/Mutation Research 455 (2000) 29‚Äì60 41
biotin at a concentration of 0.05 mM which is in ex-
cessofwhatisneededforthegrowthofthe Salmonella
strains. Because the His‚àíbacteria stop growing when
the histidine is depleted, the Ô¨Ånal population of His‚àí
bacteria is dependent on the histidine concentration.Inturn,theÔ¨Ånalpopulationontheplatewillaffectthenumber of spontaneous revertant colonies. It is there-fore important that utmost care is taken to accuratelysupplement the top agar with 0.05 mM histidine. Toolittlehistidinemayresultinthebackgroundlawnlook-ingsparse,whichmightbetakenasevidencethattoxi-city is present even on the solvent negative controlplates. Too much histidine will cause heavy growththat may obscure the revertant colonies. For the samereason, it is also important to ensure that consistenttechniques are used to deliver 2 ml of the top agar tothe GM agar plates.
7.2. GM agar plates
The Ames test uses minimal deÔ¨Åned agar medium
consisting of Vogel-Bonner E medium (V/B salts)[78], supplemented with glucose (between 0.5% and2%, w/v) and agar (1.5%, w/v). This medium is gen-erally referred to as glucose minimal agar medium(GM agar). Plates usually contain between 20 and30 ml of the medium and may be stored for severalmonths in the refrigerator in sealed plastic bags toprevent dehydration. Ideally, each laboratory shouldwork with plates that have a constant volume of agarmedium. The plates should be used fairly soon afterthey have been poured before excessive dehydrationof the agar medium occurs. Dehydration of the agarmedium will increase the concentrations of the V/Bsalts, glucose and agar which may affect the sponta-neous and induced mutagenesis process. As describedabove for the top agar, small variations in the mediumcomposition may increase variability in test results.
8. Assay procedures
8.1. Standard plate incorporation assay
Concept: The standard plate incorporation assay
consists of exposing the tester strain(s) to the testchemical directly on a minimal glucose agar plate(GM plate) usually in the presence and absence of ametabolicactivationsystem(seeFig.2).Thedifferent
components are Ô¨Årst added to sterile test tubes con-taining 2 ml of molten top agar supplemented withlimited histidine and biotin. It is important to main-tain the top agar at a temperature between 43
C and
48C and to minimize prolonged exposure to avoid
killing of the tester strains. The contents of the tubesaremixedandpouredonglucoseminimalagarplates.After the top agar has hardened the plates are in-verted and incubated at 37
C for 48 h, at which time
histidine-revertant colonies are counted on all plates.The number of colonies on the test plates are com-paredtothoseonthe(negative)solventcontrolplates.
8.2. Experimental procedure

3. The contents of the test tubes are then mixed and
poured onto the surface of GM agar plates.
4. When the top agar has hardened (2‚Äì3 min), the
plates are inverted and placed in a 37C incubator
for 48 h.
5. The colonies are then counted and the results are
expressed as the number of revertant colonies perplate.
8.3. Preincubation assay

2. Incubate the mixture at 37C for 20 min.
3. To each tube add 2 ml of molten top agar main-
tained at 43Ct o4 8C. The contents of test tubes
are then mixed and poured onto the surface of GMagar plates.
4. When the top agar has hardened (2‚Äì3 min), the
plates are inverted and placed in a 37
C incubator
for 48 h.
5. The colonies are then counted and the results are
expressed as the number of revertant colonies perplate.
Note: If the test chemical is known or suspected to
be volatile the tubes should be capped prior to thepreincubation step.
8.5. Desiccator assay for volatile liquids
Concept: Neither the standard plate incorporation
assay nor the preincubation assay is suitable for test-ing highly volatile substances. The use of a closed

chamber is recommended for testing such chemicalsin a vapor phase, as well as for gases [67,91]. Pro-cedures using plastic bags in lieu of desiccators havealso been described [8,30]. Fig. 4 depicts a desiccatorassay procedure for volatile liquids. This procedureshould be used only if it is known that the test chemi-cal will volatilize at 37
C and disperse throughout the
desiccator. A 9-l desiccator is recommended becauseup to 18 plates can be placed inside one desiccator.
8.6. Experimental procedure

are the same as those for the standard incorporationassay described above with the exception that thechemical is omitted from the test tubes.

8.7. Desiccator assay for gases
Concept: Like volatile liquids, the testing of gases
requires the use of a closed chamber such as a 9-ldesiccator [67,91]. Procedures using plastic bags inlieu of desiccators have also been described [8,30].

8.9. Reductive metabolism assay
Concept: The procedure is a modiÔ¨Åcation of the
preincubation assay and employs a modiÔ¨Åed cofactormix and the incubation mixture is shaken at 180 rpmfor90min[58,59,62‚Äì64].Thisassayisrecommendedfor testing chemicals that contain azo bonds and othersubstances that may require enzymatic reduction.
8.10. Experimental procedure
The steps taken prior to performing the experiment
are the same as those for the preincubation assay withtheexceptionthatareductivemetabolicactivationsys-tem is used (see the section: Recipes for reagents andmedia). The assay is performed as follows:44 K. Mortelmans, E. Zeiger/Mutation Research 455 (2000) 29‚Äì60
1. To the 13 100 mm sterile glass tubes add in the
following order with mild mixing after each addi-tion0.5 ml of reductive metabolic activation (S-9)
mix or buffer
0.05 ml of each dilution of the test chemical
0.05 to 0.10 ml of overnight culture of the

3. The top agar (2 ml) is then added to the incubation
mixture. After mixing, the contents of the tubesare mixed and poured onto the surface of GM agarplates
4. When the top agar has hardened (2‚Äì3 min), the
plates are inverted and placed in a 37
C incubator
for 48 h.
5. The colonies are then counted and the test results
are expressed as the number of revertant coloniesper plate.
8.11. ModiÔ¨Åed (Kado) Salmonella microsuspension
assay
Concept: This is a highly sensitive assay for test-
ing the mutagenicity of biological samples, such asurine, and pure chemicals that are available only insmall amounts [35]. The procedure is a modiÔ¨Åcationof the preincubation assay and involves using smallertest tubes (10 70 mm) and shaking of the incuba-
tion mixture for 90 min. When urine samples aretested, a deconjugating enzyme system is usually in-cluded to detect substances that are excreted as inac-tive b-glucuronides [19].
8.12. Experimental procedure
The steps taken prior to performing the experiment
are the same as those for the preincubation assaywith the exception that the overnight cultures of theSalmonella strains are washed two times in sodium
phosphate buffer, 0.1 M, pH 7.4 and concentrated10-fold. The assay is performed as follows:1. To the 10 70 mm test tubes placed in an ice bath,
add in the following order with mild mixing aftereach addition:0.1 ml of the 10-fold concentrated overnight
Salmonella culture (about 1 to 2 10
9bacteria
per tube)
0.1 ml of the metabolic activation system or
buffer
0.001, 0.0025, 0.005, or 0.01 ml of test article
(delivered with micropipettes)
0.1 ml of a deconjugating enzyme system (e.g.,
b-glucuronidase; when testing urine samples)
AdditionalsolventtoadjustÔ¨Ånalvolumeto0.25
ml or 0.35 ml when b-glucuronidase is used.
2. The mixture is allowed to incubate for 90 min at
37C with shaking (120 rpm).
3. The top agar (2 ml) is then added to the incubation
mixture.Aftermixing,thecontentsofthetubesarepoured onto the surface of GM agar plates.
4. When the top agar has hardened (1‚Äì2 min), the
plates are inverted and placed in a 37
C incubator
for 48 h.
5. The colonies are then counted and the results are
expressed as the number of revertant colonies perplate.
9. Important steps to follow for all assay
procedures
The cofactors for preparing the S-9 mix are the
same for each of the assay protocols, with the excep-tion of the reductive metabolism assay. The prepa-ration of the cofactors is described in the section:Recipes for reagents and media.
It is important to quickly swirl the plates after
addition of the top agar to the surface of the GM agarplates to ensure an even distribution of the top agarwhichcontainsthebacteria,testchemicalandS-9mixor buffer.
When the plates are inspected after 48 h of incu-
bation and growth retardation is seen as evidenced bysmallerthananticipatedcolonysizes,theplatesshouldbeincubatedforanadditional12‚Äì24h.Allplatesfromanexperimentshouldbeincubatedforthesamelengthof time in the same incubator, so that all plates froman experiment that show retarded growth at only thehigher test chemical concentrations are incubated forthe additional time.
If colonies cannot be counted immediately after
the 48-h incubation, the plates can be stored in a re-K. Mortelmans, E. Zeiger/Mutation Research 455 (2000) 29‚Äì60 45
frigeratorforupto2days.Allplatesmustberemoved
from the incubator, and be counted, at the same time.
Hand-countingmaybeneededifapotentmutagen
is being tested or when strains TA102 and TA104 areused because the automatic colony counter may notbe effective if the colony density on each plate is toohigh. In this case, quadrants of the agar plates maybe hand counted with appropriate adjustment of thecounts, provided the colonies are evenly distributedover the entire surface of the agar plate.
If precipitate or lack of contrast between the
colonies is observed on some plates, especially at thehigher dose levels, hand-counting is required of allplates (including the control plates).
Acheckforgeneticintegrityshouldbeperformed
with every experiment. For this strain check, it issufÔ¨Åcient to monitor the rfamutation and ampicillin
and tetracycline resistance using disks impregnatedwiththeappropriateconcentrationofeachcomponent[94].
10. Experimental design
The Ames Salmonella test is a versatile assay as
evidenced by the different procedural variations thatareavailable,inadditiontothenumbersofstrainsandtypesofmetabolicactivationsystemsthatcanbeused.Before initiating an Ames test, a number of criticalparameters will need to be evaluated.
10.1. Assay procedure
Forliquidchemicalstheassayofchoiceistheprein-
cubation assay because many of these chemicals maybe volatile. For most other chemicals the standardplate incorporation assay or the pre-incubation assaymay be used. However, some researchers believe thepre-incubation assay to be somewhat more selectivein detecting mutagens compared to the plate incor-poration assay. The reason may be that short-livedmutagenic metabolites have a better chance of react-ing with the tester strains in the small volume of thepreincubationmixture.Forgeneralscreeningpurposesthe laboratory should adopt one testing procedure thatwill help in developing a historical database for thenegative control, and the solvent and positive controlchemicals.The modiÔ¨Åed (Kado) Salmonella microsuspension
assay is recommended for testing samples that areavailable in only small (i.e., mg) amounts or complexmixtures such as urine. The reductive metabolismassay is recommended for chemicals that require re-duction for their activation such as azo dyes. The des-iccator assays are recommended for volatile liquidsand for gaseous substances.
10.2. Solvents
The solvent of choice is sterile distilled water.
Chemicals that do not dissolve in water should bedissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Other sol-vents that may be considered are: acetone, ethylalcohol (95%), tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamideand methyl ethyl ketone (MEK). These other solventsmay be toxic to the bacteria at higher concentrations.Therefore, a toxicity assay with these solvents shouldbe determined in a preliminary assay to determinethe maximum concentration that can be used withoutinterfering with bacterial growth and survival. Someof the solvents may also interfere with the metabolicactivation system. In such case, the concentrationof the S-9 fraction may have to be adjusted. For acomprehensive study on the compatibility of solventswith the Ames Salmonella test see Maron et al. [46].
10.3. Positive and negative (solvent) controls
Each experiment should include solvent controls
and diagnostic positive control chemicals speciÔ¨Åc foreach strain and for the metabolic activation systemTable 4 lists the representative positive controls.
10.4. Dose selection
10.4.1. Preliminary toxicity determination
It is recommended that a preliminary toxic dose
range experiment be performed to determine an ap-propriate dose range for the mutagenicity assay. Ifmore than one tester strain will be used in the muta-genicity assay, it is sufÔ¨Åcient to perform the toxicityassay with strain TA100 with and without metabolicactivation. Otherwise, the toxicity assay should beperformed with the strain that will be used in thedeÔ¨Ånitive assay. The toxicity determination can also46 K. Mortelmans, E.

be performed using an alternate toxicity assay devel-
oped by Waleh et al. [79].
The chemical should be tested for toxicity over a
widerangeofconcentrationswithatotalofeightcon-centrations,spacedinhalf-logintervals,withthehigh-est dose limited by solubility, or by an arbitrary value(usually5000or10,000 mg/plate).Forvolatileliquids
that are tested in desiccators, 0.5 and 5 ml should beused as the low and high dose, respectively. For gasestested in desiccators, the low and high dose should be0.5 and 4.5 l, respectively.
Thepreliminarytoxicityassayshouldbeperformed
in the absence and in the presence of the metabolicactivationsystemthatistobeusedinthedeÔ¨Ånitivemu-tagenicity assay. Positive and solvent control chemi-cals need to be included in the assay; one plate perdose level should be sufÔ¨Åcient. As mentioned in theToxicity determination section, it is important that thesame number of bacteria be used in the preliminarytoxicity assay as well as in the deÔ¨Ånitive mutagenic-ity assay. Exposing a diluted culture to the chemicalcould result in an erroneous higher toxicity level [79].
10.4.2. Doses for deÔ¨Ånitive assay
A minimum of Ô¨Åve dose levels covering a range of
at least three logs should be selected for the deÔ¨Åni-tive test. Two or three plates should be used for eachdose level and for the controls. For toxic chemicals,only the highest dose used should exhibit toxicity. Fornon-toxic chemicals, a high dose of 5000 or 10,000mg/plateisacceptable.Non-solublechemicalsmaybe
tested as a suspension up to a dose level that does notinterfere with handling of the suspension with pipetsor pipet tips. For non-toxic volatile liquids that aretested in desiccators, 5 ml should be used as the high
dose. For non-toxic gases tested in desiccators, thehigh dose should be 4.5 l.
Note: Each test should be performed using a sin-
gle batch of reagents, media, and agar. The use ofdifferent batches of bottom agar plates, top agar,buffer, solvents, cofactors, or S-9 batches within anexperiment can lead to excess variation in the re-sults, or clear demarcations of results between thedifferent batches.
10.5. Strain selection and testing strategies
TherehasbeennoevidencetoshowthatthespeciÔ¨Åc
tester strains, or the number of tester strains mutatedby a chemical, is related to the chemical‚Äôs potencyin other test systems, or the predictivity of the testresult for cancer induction or other effects. Therefore,it may not be necessary to test all chemicals with thefull complement of strains. Although a single strain issufÔ¨Åcient to demonstrate a mutagenic response, it isgenerallyacceptedthatanegativeresultcanbedeÔ¨Ånedusing 4‚Äì5 tester strains. Strains TA98, TA100, andTA97orTA1537arealwaysconsiderednecessary.Theother strains usually used are TA1535 and/or TA102.
When planning to test a large number of chemi-
cals, it may be most time and cost efÔ¨Åcient to per-form the testing in stages. For example, it has beenshownthattestingwithstrainsTA98andTA100with-out metabolic activation and with S-9 from rats orhamsterswassufÔ¨Åcienttoidentifyapproximately90%ofthemutagensinapopulationcontainingabout35%mutagenic chemicals [95]. Using such a strategy, thechemicals not mutagenic or equivocal in these twoK. Mortelmans, E. Zeiger/Mutation Research 455 (2000) 29‚Äì60 47
strains can be tested in additional strains. The higher
the anticipated number of mutagens among the chem-icals to be tested, the more cost effective the stagedtesting strategy will be.
If there is prior information about the chemical or
class of chemicals to be tested that indicates the needfor speciÔ¨Åc treatment conditions, or that the chemicalis likely to induce a certain type of DNA damage,the testing strategy should be directed appropriately.For example, if the chemicals are of a structure thatis known to require metabolic activation, the initialscreencouldbeperformedonlywithS-9mix,orifthechemicals are structurally related to a class known toproduceonlybase-pairsubstitutions,theinitialtestingcould use only the appropriate target strains.
10.5.1. Tier approach
Unless required by speciÔ¨Åc guidelines, it is recom-
mended that for general screening purposes a tier ap-proach be used using strains TA98 and TA100 withand without metabolic activation
If a positive response is obtained the assay is re-
peated only using the condition(s) and strain(s) thatelicited the positive response. If needed, the doserange may be adjusted to better clarify a dose re-sponse. If equivocal or weak positive responses areobtained, the corresponding plasmid-free strains,TA1538 and TA1535, respectively, should be used.JustiÔ¨Åcation for the use of TA1535 comes from anumber of reports about unique positive results inTA1535 [12,16,29,52,60,86]. Demonstration of aunique response in strain TA1538 is more challengingbecause few databases have data available comparedto databases that have strain TA1535 included. How-ever, speciÔ¨Åc examples of strain TA1538 giving aunique response exist.
If negative results are obtained in the initial muta-
genicitytestwithstrainTA98andTA100,otherstrainssuch as TA1535 and TA97 are used with and with-outmetabolicactivation.AconÔ¨Årmationexperimentisperformedifapositiveresponseisobtainedusingonlythe condition(s) and strain(s) in which the mutagenicresponse was observed. If equivocal results or a weakresponse are obtained in strain TA97, strain TA1537can be used in an attempt to clarify the results.
Strains TA102 and TA104 may be used if it is
suspected that the chemical may induce oxidativedamage (i.e., free radical production), or be a DNAcross-linking agent. Strain TA102 is especially sensi-
tive for detecting DNA cross-linking damage becauseit has an intact (wild-type) DNA excision repairmechanism which is required for the repair of suchdamage. Fig. 5 depicts the tier approach experimen-tal design described above which is based on theprocedure described by Zeiger et al. [89].
If prior to testing information is available about the
potential mutagenicity of the chemical or chemicalclass, the initial testing is performed with the strain(s)most likely to yield a positive response.
10.5.2. Battery approach
A battery approach employs a Ô¨Åxed set of tester
strains for testing a chemical in the presence and ab-sence of a metabolic activation system. For generalmutagenicity testing it is recommended that strainsTA97, TA98, TA100 and TA102 be used. However,some laboratories use strain TA1535 instead of strainTA102 when a tier approach is used in the selectionof tester strains [91]. As in the tier approach, strainsTA1538 and TA1535 are used when equivocal resultsare obtained with their respective pKM101-carryingstrains, TA98 and TA100. Strain TA1537 can detectmutagens not detected by strain TA97. Strain TA104,though in some laboratories tested in parallel withTA102,isrecommendedwhennegativeresultsareob-tainedinstrainTA102especiallyifitissuspectedthata chemical may cause oxidative DNA damage.
10.6. Metabolic activation
Prior to performing an experiment, the S-9 fraction
is added to the enzymic cofactors containing NADPto make up the S-9 mix to be used in the assay. TheS-9 fraction concentration is usually expressed as ‚Äú%v/v‚Äù.ItisimportanttonotethatboththecofactorsandS-9 fraction should be stored frozen. They should bethawed at room temperature and quickly transferredto ice. Once the S-9 mix is prepared it should be kepton ice for the duration of the experiment. Because themetabolic conversion of different chemicals to theirmutagenic form may require different optimum levelsof S-9 fraction, the amount of S-9 fraction used isvariable;itcanrangefrom4%to30%(v/v)intheS-9mix [7,47].
Aroclor 1254-induced rat liver is the most widely
used source of activating enzymes [7]. In the ab-48 K. Mortelmans, E. Zeiger/Mutation Research 455 (2000) 29‚Äì60
Fig. 5. Diagram of tier approach testing strategy.
sence of speciÔ¨Åc information about the optimizing
S-9 concentration, it is recommended that between5% and 30% (v/v in the cofactor mix) of the S-9fraction be used. Some laboratories use a low S-9concentration (e.g., 5% or 10%) in the Ô¨Årst muta-genicity assay. If negative results are obtained, asubsequent test with a high S-9 level (30%) is per-formed. Other laboratories use the higher level ofS-9 Ô¨Årst, and use the low level in the second experi-ment if negative results are obtained in the initial
experiment.
Procedures for preparing the S-9 fraction have
been described in detail [7,47,93]. If the S-9 fractionis prepared in the testing laboratory, it is recom-mended that more than one animal be used and thetissue homogenate be pooled in order to minimizeanimal-to-animal variation among batches. Somelaboratories standardize the S-9 concentration basedK. Mortelmans, E. Zeiger/Mutation Research 455 (2000) 29‚Äì60 49
on measured protein content while other laboratories
standardize the S-9 fraction on the assumption that1 ml of the S-9 fraction contains microsomes fromabout 250 mg of wet livers with a protein concentra-tion of 40 mg/ml. S-9 fractions may be stored frozenin small aliquots for up to 1 year at ‚àí80
C.
Note:Whenusingliveanimals,itisrequiredthatall

A number of commercial vendors are now pro-
viding S-9 preparations. This has the advantage thatinformation is provided about enzyme activities andeffectiveness against standard mutagens, and it maybe more cost-effective than purchasing and maintain-ing animals for this purpose. In the United States,a supplier for rodent post mitochondrial supernatant(S-9) is Molecular Toxicology, 157 Industrial ParkDrive, Boone, NC 28607, Phone: C1-828-264-9099.
10.7. Positive control chemicals
Diagnostic mutagens (positive control chemicals)
mustbeincludedineachexperimenttoconÔ¨Årmthere-version properties and speciÔ¨Åcity of each tester strain,and the efÔ¨Åcacy of the metabolic activation system.Table 4 lists the positive control chemicals with theirrespective concentrations/plate that have been rou-tinely used in the authors‚Äô laboratories. Other chem-icals can be selected as positive controls [7,37,47].Where the test chemicals are members of a speciÔ¨Åcchemical class, a positive control chemical with asimilar structure, or requiring similar metabolism,should be used. The optimum positive control con-centration should be determined for each new batchof metabolic activation (S-9). Some researchers havesuggested that 2-aminoanthracene should not be rec-ommended as the only positive control to evaluatethe metabolizing activity of the S-9 fraction [23], be-cause it has been shown that 2-aminoanthracene maybe activated by enzymes other than the microsomalcytochrome P450 family [10].
10.8. Number of replicates and repeat experiments
Itisrecommendedthatatleastthreeplatesperdose
level are used with at least Ô¨Åve dose levels and a sol-vent control. When positive results are obtained, the
test should be repeated using the identical conditionsthat yielded the positive response in order to conÔ¨Årmtheresponse.Itisrecommendedthatonlythestrain(s)and condition(s) that yielded the mutagenic responseareusedfortheconÔ¨Årmingassay.Thedoselevelsmaybe changed to better establish the dose response. Ifnegative results are obtained, a repeat assay is recom-mended in both the tier and battery approach whichmay include a slight modiÔ¨Åcation of the procedure byusing a different concentration of the S-9 fraction, ora different procedure (e.g., preincubation instead ofplate incorporation).
11. Interpretation and reporting
11.1. Counting of histidine revertant colonies
After the plates are removed from the incubator,
the colonies are counted and the results are expressedas revertant colonies per plate. For this purpose, anelectronic counter is a convenient way to count thecolonies,especiallyforstrainsTA100andTA97whichusually have a spontaneous background above 100colonies/plate. However, hand-counting is requiredwhen strains TA102 and TA104 are used because ofthe high number of spontaneous revertant colonies,usually above 200 colonies/plate. Hand-counting isalso required when precipitate is present on the plate,when there is poor contrast between the colony andthe agar, or when a test chemical discolors the agarwhich prevents sufÔ¨Åcient light from passing throughthe agar. If precipitate is present on the plates atthe higher dose levels, all plates, including the sol-vent control plates, should be hand-counted. Also,all plates from a single experiment, including posi-tive and negative control plates, should be countedusing the same method at the same time, becausethe cells on the plate will continue dividing and pro-duce more mutant colonies with increased storagetime.
At the time the plates are scored, their background
lawns should be examined by eye and by using a 40 
dissecting microscope for thinning, which indicatestoxicity,andforthepresenceofprecipitate.Slighttoxi-city or precipitate will not invalidate the experiment,or the doses at which they were found, but they may50 K. Mortelmans, E. Zeiger/Mutation Research 455 (2000) 29‚Äì60
affect the interpretation of the results and the design
of follow-up experiments.
11.2. Data reporting
The results are generally reported as mean rever-
tant colonies per plate the S.D. or S.E.M. for the
test chemical and the controls. The concentration ofthe test chemical is expressed as mg or mg/plate,
or milliliter or mole in the desiccator procedure forvolatile liquids and gases, respectively. Informationregarding toxicity and/or precipitation of the testchemical should also be included. The results canalsobeexpressedasthefold-increaseoverthesolventcontrol value, but this must be done in addition to themean plate count. Fold-increase, alone, may not besufÔ¨Åcient to allow an objective evaluation of the data,or of the effectiveness of the experiment.
11.3. Data evaluation
11.3.1. Statistical procedures
A number of statistical programs have been de-
veloped for analyzing Salmonella mutagenicity
data, and all have their strengths and weaknesses[13,20,36,44,70,76,81]. Another approach that hasbeen widely used is to set a minimum fold increase,usually 2‚Äì3 fold, in revertants (over the solvent con-trol) as the cut-off between a mutagenic and non-mutagenic response [42]. This approach also has itsweaknesses, for example, if a two-fold increase isrequired, a change in the average plate count by onerevertant out of one or a few hundred can be thedifference between calling a chemical mutagenic ornonmutagenic. Also, it has been shown [15] that thetwo-fold rule may be too insensitive for Salmonella
strains with relatively high reversion frequencies,such as TA100, TA97, and TA102, and too sensitivefor chemicals with low reversion frequencies, such asTA1535 and TA1537.
11.3.2. Non-statistical procedure
A non-statistical procedure has been established to
evaluate the results of Salmonella experiments [91].
Using this procedure the following criteria are used tointerpret results.
PositivePositivePositive :Acompoundisconsideredamutagenif
itproducesareproducible,dose-relatedincreaseinthenumberofrevertantcoloniesinoneormorestrains.A
compoundisconsideredaweakmutagenifitproducesa reproducible, dose-related increase in the numberof revertant colonies in one or more strains but thenumber of revertants is not double the backgroundnumber of colonies.
NegativeNegativeNegative : A compound is considered a nonmu-
tagen if no dose-related increase in the number ofrevertant colonies is observed in at least two indepen-dent experiments. The maximum dose level tested fornontoxic compounds is 5 or 10 mg/plate (unless oth-erwise dictated by solubility). For volatile liquids andgases, the maximum dose level tested in desiccatorsis 5 ml and 4.5 l, respectively. For toxic compounds,ideally only the highest dose level should exhibit evi-dence of toxicity (e.g., thinning or complete absenceof background lawn with or without the presence ofpinpoint colonies.
InconclusiveInconclusiveInconclusive :IfacompoundcannotbeidentiÔ¨Åed
clearly as a mutagen or a nonmutagen, the results areclassiÔ¨Åed as inconclusive (e.g., if there is a scatteringof slightly elevated revertant counts or one elevatedcount).
Regardless of whether a statistical or non-statistical
approach is used for data evaluation, it should be ade-quatelydescribedandconsistentacrossstrainsandac-tivation procedures. Responses that are judged to beweakly positive or equivocal should be considered foradditional testing, using a modiÔ¨Åcation of the expo-sure protocol, or a change in the dose range tested orS-9 mix concentration used.
Because control ranges vary among laboratories,
each laboratory should establish its own solvent andpositive control ranges for each tester strain, with andwithout S-9. This range should be used to develop ac-ceptance criteria for individual experiments, and ex-periments should be rejected if solvent controls areoutside the acceptable range, or if positive controlchemicals do not respond appropriately.
12. Safety considerations
12.1. Aseptic technique
It is important that basic bacteriological labora-
tory procedures be used to minimize exposure totheSalmonella tester strains. Surface areas must beK. Mortelmans, E. Zeiger/Mutation Research 455 (2000) 29‚Äì60 51
properly disinfected before and after use. Though
wild-type S. typhimurium can cause diarrhea and
food poisoning, the galandrfa(deep rough) mu-
tations that are present in all the Salmonella tester
strains described here eliminate to different levels,the polysaccharide side chain of the LPS layer thatcoats the bacterial surface which makes the bacte-ria non-pathogenic [5,83]. It is nevertheless prudentto use caution at all times and to practice standardlaboratory safety procedures such as using pluggedpipettes and autoclaving all contaminated material.Mouth-pipetting as a general rule should never bepracticed.Aseptictechniques,beingpartofbasicbac-teriologicallaboratoryprocedures,arealsoessentialtoprevent contamination of the overnight cultures, GMagar plates, and the solutions and reagents. Contami-nated frozen permanent and working cultures of theSalmonella testerstrainswillbeuselessandshouldbe
discarded.
12.2. Safety procedures
Asageneralrule,itisprudenttoconsiderallchemi-
cals as if they were mutagens and carcinogens. Allhandlingofchemicals,aswellasthetestitself,shouldbe performed in a chemical safety cabinet. Workersshould protect themselves from chemical exposure bywearing gowns, eye glasses and gloves. Wearers ofcontact lenses should wear regular eye glasses sincesome volatile chemicals might react with the contactlens.Allcontaminatedmaterial(e.g.,testtubes,pipetsand pipet tips, gowns and gloves) should be properlydisposed of as well as the unused chemical dilutionsand stock solutions of the test chemical, and positivecontrol chemicals.

through the internet. The Environmental Mutagen In-formationCenter(EMIC)databasecanbeenteredthr-oughhttp://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/servlets/simple-search?1.25.0.3876.

and TA100(4) Contamination may be present
Solutions : (1) Inspect the background lawn. A
heavier than normal background lawnindicates that too much histidine waspresent in the top agar. Prepare newtop agar ensuring that the proper con-centration of histidine is used. It isalso possible that the test sample maycontain histidine. This is often thecase when biological Ô¨Çuids such asurine, or food-related items, such asproteins and meat extracts, have beentested(2) Check a few frozen working stockampoules for spontaneous reversion.If the problem persists, reisolate thestrain selecting a clone that gives riseto a spontaneous reversion rate in theproper range(3) Use radiation-sterilized plates, orallow plates to off-gas for one day in achemical or biological fume hood(4) Reisolate strain
