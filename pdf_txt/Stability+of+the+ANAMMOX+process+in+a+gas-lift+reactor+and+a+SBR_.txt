The effects of high salinity conditions (up to 30 g NaCl L−1) on the efﬁciency and activity of the Anammox
process were studied in a sequencing batch reactor. The use of the estimated maximum Speciﬁc AnammoxActivity (SAA) was evaluated as a monitoring parameter of the performance of the process. The SAA valuesobtained from biomass adapted under the same salinity conditions and collected from the reactor couldbe used to calculate the maximum capacity of the system and, therefore, to predict its efﬁciency at acertain operation condition. Batch assays carried out with non-adapted and adapted Anammox biomassat different salt concentrations indicated a stimulatory effect on the SAA at concentrations up to 6 and15 g NaCl L
−1while higher salt concentrations caused a decrease in the activity. The addition of salt
enhanced the aggregation of Anammox biomass in granules with a consequent decrease in the SludgeVolumetric Index from 80 to 25 mL g VSS
−1. The system was able to treat a nitrite loading rate around
0.32 g NO 2−-N L−1d−1when salt concentrations of 15 g L−1of NaCl were present in the feeding, with
nitrogen removal efﬁciencies of 99%. The Anammox process exhibited high resistance to the presenceof high NaCl concentrations being then recommended to remove nitrogen from efﬂuents with high saltconcentrations.

1. Introduction
The combination of partial nitriﬁcation and Anammox pro-
cesses is an attractive alternative to remove nitrogen compoundsfrom high nitrogen loaded wastewater with low organic mattercontent. The advantages over the traditional combined nitriﬁca-tion/denitriﬁcation processes are manifold: less oxygen demand,no carbon addition and less area requirement. However, the appli-cation of Anammox may be hindered by the presence of differentexogenous compounds for which the effect on the Anammoxbiomass is still unknown. This is the case of high salinity efﬂuents,as those produced in the ﬁsh canning industry due to the use of seawater during the manufacturing processes. These efﬂuents are gen-erally ﬁrstly treated via an anaerobic digestion stage, generating anefﬂuent with a low C/N which can be treated by partial nitriﬁcationand Anammox processes. Anaerobic digestion has been shown tobe an adequate system to treat ﬁsh cannery efﬂuents with high saltconcentrations [1,2] while other studies indicated that high saline
concentrations have negative effects on either partial nitriﬁcation[3] or Anammox process [4].
Works carried out to research the effect of exogenous com-
pounds, such as salt, on biological processes are basically focused

E-mail address: jose.vazquez.padin@usc.es (J.R. Vázquez-Padín).on the determination of the concentration which causes the desta-
bilization of the system [5,6] . Since these works were performed at
different operational conditions (loading rates, biomass concentra-tion) or the biomass used had different characteristics (enrichmentdegree, adaptation periods), discrepancies between the resultsobtained are frequently found. Therefore, these factors should betaken into account in the analysis of the effect of exogenous com-pounds on the efﬁciency of the process.
Generally the exogenous compounds decrease the maximum
speciﬁc activity of biomass reducing the loading rate which can betreated by the system. This reduction cannot affect the efﬁciencyof the process if the maximum capacity of the system, calculatedas the product of the maximum speciﬁc activity of biomass by thebiomass concentration, is still higher than the supplied loading rate.However if the capacity turns lower than the loading rate supplied,due to the effect of any toxic compound, the efﬁciency decreasesand the substrate starts to accumulate in the reactor. This fact iscritical if the process is inhibited by substrate because its presencecauses a loss of efﬁciency which increases the accumulation of sub-strate causing a snowballing effect until the system totally losesits efﬁciency [7]. This effect must be considered in the case of the
Anammox process which is inhibited by both ammonia and nitrite,the later being more toxic [8].
Dapena-Mora et al. [9] showed that the determination of the
maximum Speciﬁc Anammox Activity (SAA) by batch tests couldbe very useful in order to determine the maximum capacity of the

system. Nevertheless, when toxicants are present, inhibitory effects
found during activity tests cannot be easily extrapolated to predictthe efﬁciency of the system during a continuous operation evenwhen adapted biomass is utilized [4]. This fact could be due to the
exposure time or to the adaptation of biomass to the toxicant eitherby the adaptation of the existing population or by a population shift.Therefore, it should be useful to establish a protocol to determinea value of the maximum speciﬁc activity so that it could be used tomonitor the operation of the reactor.
For this reason, the aim of the present study was to research
the effects of NaCl on the maximum Speciﬁc Anammox Activityunder different conditions to know which of the obtained valuescan predict the capacity of the system. On other hand, the effectof salt on physical properties of Anammox biomass will also bestudied.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Anammox reactor
A Sequential Batch Reactor (SBR) with a working volume of 3 L
was used to carry out the Anammox process. The SBR was pro-vided with a thermostatic jacket to keep the temperature at 35
◦C.
Complete mixture was achieved inside the reactor by means of atwo-blade mechanical stirrer with a rotating speed of 100 rpm. ThepH value was not controlled and ranged from 7.5 to 8.0. Anoxicconditions were kept in the reactor by ﬂushing argon gas.
The SBR was operated in cycles of 6 h distributed in the following
periods established according to Dapena-Mora et al. [10] : continu-
ous stirred feeding during 300 min; stirring without feeding during30 min; settling for 20 min and efﬂuent withdrawal for 10 min. Thehydraulic retention time (HRT) was ﬁxed at 1 day.
2.2. Feeding composition
The mineral medium fed in this study presents the follow-
ing composition per litre of demineralised water: 0.707–1.650 g(NH
4)2SO 4, 0.739–1.725 g NaNO 2, 0.425 g NaNO 3, 1.25 g KHCO 3,
0.025 g KH 2PO 4, 0.3 g CaCl 22H 2O, 0.2 g MgSO 47H 2O, 0.00625 g
FeSO 4, 0.00625 g EDTA, 1.25 mL HCl (1 M) and 1.25 mL trace ele-
ments solution [11] . This medium contains ammonia in excess
(molar ratio NH 4+/NO 2−of 1) to prevent the presence of nitrite
in the reactor because of its strong inhibitory effect on the Anam-mox activity [8]. The concentration of Anammox biomass was of
0.9 gVSS L
−1at the beginning of the experiment. This biomass was
enriched in bacteria belonging to the species Candidatus “Kuenenia
stuttgartiensis”.
2.3. Operational strategy
The SBR reactor was operated in three different stages
(Table 1 ): (I) the nitrite loading rate (NiLR) was kept constant
a t 0 . 1 5gNL−1d−1while the concentration of NaCl was stepwise
increased from 0 to 20 g NaCl L−1in periods of 6–12 days of dura-
tion (the ﬁrst increase in the NaCl concentration was registered onday 251); (II) this is a transition period meaning that the concen-tration of NaCl and the NiLR were initially decreased from 20 to

wards increased up to 15 g L−1of NaCl and 0.20 g NO 2−-N L−1d−1,
respectively (days 294–327); in the third stage (days 328–400) theinlet concentration of NaCl was maintained constant at 15 g L
−1and
the NiLR was stepwise increased from 0.20 to 0.3 5gNL−1d−1.
2.4. Measurement of the maximum Speciﬁc Anammox Activity
(SAA)
The maximum Speciﬁc Anammox Activity (SAA) of the biomass
from the reactor was measured by means of batch assays describedin detail by Buys et al. [12] and modiﬁed by Dapena-Mora et al.
[8]. Maximum SAA was estimated from the maximum slope of the
curve described by the cumulative N
2production along the time
and related to the biomass concentration in the vials. Each test wasdone in triplicate.
In order to determine the effect of NaCl on a non-adapted
biomass, a ﬁrst series of Anammox activity tests was performedwith sludge collected from the 3 L Anammox SBR just before NaClwas added in the feeding. In this case, a standard buffer (SB)containing 0.143 g KH
2PO 4L−1and 0.747 g K 2HPO 4L−1was used
(Fig. 1 ).
To evaluate the effect of the salt on adapted biomass a sec-
ond series of Anammox activity tests was carried out with sludgecollected from the Anammox reactor in each operational period,corresponding to the different NaCl concentrations in the feeding.To establish the possible adaptation of biomass to saline conditions,three different buffer solutions were used in parallel for each testedsample:
(1) A standard buffer (SB) containing 0.143 g KH
2PO 4L−1and
0.747 g K 2HPO 4L−1.
(2) A standard buffer with the same salt (SBS) concentration as
NaCl than that present in the reactor when the biomass wascollected.
(3) The own liquid media from the SBR reactor at the corresponding
operational conditions (RB).
2.5. Analytical methods
Ammonium was analysed by the phenol-hypochlorite method
[13] . Biomass concentration measured as volatile suspended solids
(VSS), nitrite and nitrate analysed by spectrophotometry, pH valuewas measured with a selective electrode Ingold and the sludge vol-A. Dapena-Mora et al. / Biochemical Engineering Journal 51 (2010) 167–171 169

umetric index (SVI) were determined according to the Standard
Methods [14] .
Morphological studies of the biomass were performed with a
scan electron microscope (Digital SEM Leica 440 at 20 kV). Thesludge sample was washed three times for 10 min with phosphatebuffer 0.05N at pH 7.4 and subsequently ﬁxed with a solution ofglutaraldehyde 3% in a phosphate buffer solution over night. Afterﬁxation, the sample was dehydrated using ethanol solutions withincreasing ethanol concentrations (30%, 50%, 70% and 100%). Laterthe sample was shaded with gold and observed under the scanelectron microscope. Micro-analysis was performed with a scanelectron microscope (SEM LEO-435VP; EDX) to research the ele-mental composition of the biomass samples. FISH tests were carriedout according to the methodology of Figueroa et al. [15] .
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Effects of the NaCl on the Speciﬁc Anammox Activity
The experimental work was carried out in a mature Anammox
SBR that had been operated during 240 days before the salt wasadded in the feeding (data not shown).
The feeding contained, at the beginning of stage I, 300 mg N L
−1
as ammonia and nitrite respectively. The SAA of non-adapted
biomass was estimated from biomass samples collected from thereactor before day 250 (no NaCl was added in the feeding) at differ-ent NaCl concentrations ( Fig. 2 A). The value of the SAA measured
in absence of NaCl was of 0.15 g NO
2−-N g VSS−1d−1. A stimula-
tory effect on the SAA was observed up to 6 g L−1of NaCl while the
IC50value (concentration which causes SAA inhibition of 50%) was
estimated of 13.5 g L−1. These results are similar to those found by
Kartal et al. [4] for an Anammox population of Candidatus “Kuenenia
stuttgartiensis” although they observed better resistance of theirbiomass to salinity conditions meaning that Anammox activity waspresent up to concentration of 90 g L
−1of NaCl.
On day 250 the feeding was supplemented with different con-
centrations of NaCl for 150 days in three operational stages. Duringstage I, the Anammox SBR was operated for 43 days at a constantNiLR of 0.15 g NO
2−-N L−1d−1, while NaCl concentration was step-
wise increased to research its effects on the Anammox process.
The batch experiments carried out using the SB solution gave
nearly constant SAA values for all the tested NaCl concentrationand a decrease of the SAA was observed only when 20 g NaCl L
−1
was added ( Fig. 2 B). This fact could be attributed to a sudden
decrease of salt concentration in the reaction media which couldreduce the activity of the Anammox biomass [16] . In the experi-
ments performed with the SBS solution, the maximum SAA of thebiomass in the reactor was higher than that obtained with the SB
solution at the same salt concentration up to 15 g NaCl L
−1. When
20 g NaCl L−1were tested a decrease of the SAA occurred. Simi-
lar results were obtained when the RB solution was used. Similarresults were obtained by Kartal et al. [4] who found an increase of
the Anammox activity up to a salt concentration of 30 g NaCl L
−1in
batch experiments using adapted biomass. However, Windey et al.[5] studying the performance of the OLAND process for the treat-
ment of high salinity wastewater, found that the activity of thesalt-adapted Anammox biomass decreased 59% at 30 g NaCl L
−1.
It seems clear that the Anammox biomass is highly resistant to
the presence of salt concentration (NaCl). Since many Anammoxbacteria have been identiﬁed in marine ecosystems where the saltconcentrations are even higher than those studied in this work, thesalt resistance was not an unexpected event [17,18] . The obtained
results differ from one work to another indicating that factors suchas the kind of enriched Anammox bacteria present and the degree ofenrichment in the reactor or even the biomass story are importantparameters to take into account.
On the other hand, the results obtained in the present work using
adapted and non-adapted biomass showed that when the Anam-mox biomass is continuously subjected to high NaCl concentrationsits resistance to salt clearly increases as was also documented [4,5] .
3.2. Monitoring the capacity of the reactor
The efﬁciency of the Anammox reactor was followed by the
depletion of nitrite in the efﬂuent since ammonia was always sup-plied in excess. During the ﬁrst and second stages, the removalefﬁciency of nitrite was around 99%. Nevertheless, during the thirdperiod on day 336, nitrite accumulation (up to 82 mg NO
2−-N L−1)
appeared in the reactor due to a failure of the electricity supply. Thecomplete efﬁciency of the system was practically restored despitethe continuous increase of the NiLR. Nitrite was also accumulatedin the reactor and maintained in a value around 120 mg NO
2−-N L−1
when the NiLR was increased from 0.325 to 0.35 g NO 2−-N L−1d−1
(day 360). In this case the concentration of nitrite in the inﬂuent was
lowered to 300 mg NO 2−-N L−1and the high efﬁciency of the pro-
cess was restored. The SAA of the biomass measured in batch testsstayed almost constant along this third operational period (around0.29 g NO
2−-N g VSS−1d−1).
The maximum capacity of the system was estimated as the prod-
uct of the biomass concentration by the maximum SAA measuredin batch tests. As the biomass concentration slightly increased from0.9 to 1.2 g VSS L
−1during the whole operational period, the vari-
ations of the system capacity are closely related to the changes ofSAA due to the changes of salinity conditions.170 A. Dapena-Mora et al. / Biochemical Engineering Journal 51 (2010) 167–171
Fig. 3. NiLR supplied ( /circlecopyrt) and maximum capacity of the system ( /H17033) during the whole
operational period.
The maximum capacity of the system was estimated during the
whole operational period using the SAA values measured usingnon-adapted and adapted biomass. When the SAA values obtainedwith non-adapted biomass are extrapolated according to the oper-ational conditions of the reactor, the capacities estimated are lowerthan those estimated from the substrates consumption in the SBRfor each NaCl concentration. Similar results are found when theSAA values measured with adapted biomass using SB solution areemployed. Nevertheless, if the capacity of the system is calculatedon basis of the SAA obtained with adapted biomass under the samesalinity conditions of the reactor (SBS and RB), the results obtainedcan perfectly explain the efﬁciency of the reactor ( Fig. 3 ). Dur-
ing the ﬁrst and second periods, the capacity was always higherthan the NiLR supplied which justiﬁes the high efﬁciency observed.During the third period, the capacity of the system was almost con-stant at a value around 0.34 g NO
2−-N L−1d−1, therefore, when NiLR
supplied exceeded this value, nitrite started to accumulate in thesystem (day 360). A decrease of NiLR supplied from 0.35 to 0.30 gNO
2−-N L−1d−1restored the nitrite removal efﬁciency.
These results showed that the measurement of the maximum
SAA under similar salinity conditions of the reactor can be usedto know the maximum NiLR which can be supplied to the systemmaintaining a high efﬁciency. This is useful to operate the systemclose to its maximum capacity and to get shorter start-up. However,Kartal et al. [4] found a total loss of the Anammox activity when
45 g NaCl L
−1were introduced continuously while the same salt-
adapted biomass maintained 90% of its maximum activity in batchtests at the same salt concentration. This fact could be explainedby a mixture inhibition of salt and nitrite during the continuousoperation due to the nitrite concentration used during continuousassays was higher than during batch tests.
Windley et al. [5], using batch tests, observed speciﬁc activities
of 46 and 32 mg NH
4+-N g VSS−1d−1for nitrifying and Anammox
biomasses, respectively, at 30 g NaCl L−1. However, the limiting step
of the OLAND process operated continuously in the presence ofthe same salt concentration was the nitrifying process. In this case,the discrepancy between results of batch and continuous assayscould be related to the different dissolved oxygen levels used dur-ing continuous operation (lower than 1 mg O
2L−1) and nitrifying
batch tests (above 3.3 mg O 2L−1). For this reason, speciﬁc nitrifying
activity in the reactor is lower than the activity measured in discon-tinuous assays. This fact remarks that it is important to carry outbatch assays under similar operational conditions to the reactor inorder to extrapolate the results.

3.3. Biomass characteristics
The effect of salt on the physical properties of biomass is very
important in order to maintain a good retention of the biomassinside the system. In this case, when NaCl was supplied to thefeeding media physical properties of the sludge changed fromﬂocculent to granular, the SVI signiﬁcantly decreased from 80 to25 mL g VSS
−1(Fig. 4 ). A decrease in the SVI of Anammox biomass
from 120 to 50 mL g VSS−1was also reported by Fernández et al. [19]
when adding NaCl to a synthetic media with concentrations up to10 g NaCl L
−1. Improvement of the SVI of the biomass from 42 to
11 mL g VSS−1after 150 days of operation has been observed also by
Campos et al. [6] in a nitrifying reactor treating 4 g NH 4+-N L−1d−1
and containing in the feeding media concentrations of a mixture
of salts (NH 4Cl, (NH 4)2SO 4,K H 2PO 4and NaCl) up to 525 mM. Dahl
et al. [20] , treating in a nitrifying system wastewater with high
salinity (20 g Cl−L−1) and ammonia concentration of 120 mg NH 4+-
NL−1, obtained a sludge with a SVI of 32 mL g VSS−1. In other cases
a negative effect was observed like in the case of Moon et al.[21] . These authors found ﬂoc size decreased and settling prop-
erties deteriorated with increasing salt concentration when theytreated seafood wastewater with a SBR at NaCl concentrations upto 10 g L
−1.
The VSS/TSS ratio of the sludge decreased from 0.85 to 0.70
indicating the accumulation of inorganic matter in the granularbiomass. This was conﬁrmed from observations of the biomass byelectron microscopy. A microanalysis of the precipitates indicatedthat the precipitate formed was mainly Ca
3(PO 4)2. The ions Ca2+
and PO 43−were supplemented with the feeding mineral medium
in the form of CaCl 2and KH 2PO 4, respectively. In some cases it
was observed under the stereomicroscope the granulation of thebiomass around these precipitation nuclides, what could explainthe high decrease in the SVI because of the addition of salt to thesystem. These results agree with the inert nuclei model proposedby Hulshoff Pol et al. [22] . In this model, the presence of inert
microparticles, anaerobic bacteria could attach to the particle sur-faces to form the initial bioﬁlms, and the mature granules can befurther developed through the growth of these attached bacteriaunder given operation conditions. In this case, the precipitates ofCa
3(PO 4)2could serve as the inert nuclei or micro-size biocarrier
for bacterial attachment and further granulation.
van Langerak et al. [23] studied the development of anaerobic
granular sludge in UASB reactors using different calcium concen-trations in the inﬂuent. These authors found that a low Ca/Na ratio,a small granule diameter and a high crystallization rate constant (inthat case, low CaCO
3growth inhibition) stimulate precipitation inA. Dapena-Mora et al. / Biochemical Engineering Journal 51 (2010) 167–171 171

the bulk solution, and are considered to be favourable parameters
for the development of sludge with a high ash content and a goodquality.
The granulation of the biomass is also related to the change of
its aspect from disperse ﬂocs to granules. The colour of the biomassalso changed to a more intense red as the granule density increasedprobably due to the more compact aggregation of the Anammoxbacteria around the precipitates ( Fig. 5 ).
4. Conclusions
(1) The presence of NaCl in the media causes an increase of the SAA
for both adapted and non-adapted biomass at concentrationsbetween 3 and 15 g NaCl L
−1, respectively.
(2) Anammox biomass is able to cope with different NaCl con-
centrations with no detrimental effect on the SAA up toconcentrations of 15 g NaCl L
−1.
(3) Batch activity assays carried out under similar operational con-
ditions to the reactor can be used to estimate the maximumcapacity of the system and to avoid overloads when the effectof the presence of an inhibitory compound is studied.
(4) High salt concentrations did not have long-term detrimental
effects on the physical properties of sludge and even pro-mote the aggregation in the form of granules of the Anammoxbiomass.
