 Abstract  
Due to the extensive use of xenobiotic azo dyes in the colour indu stry and their proven 
mutagenic and cytotoxic nature, their treatment prior to discharge is essential and is 
legally enforced. However, currently used wastewater treatment technologies such as 
activated sludge systems, anaerobic digestion, electrochemical destruction, adsorption 
and membrane filtration are ine ffective in removing azo dyes du e to reasons such as 
inefficient dye degradation, slow degradation kinetics, toxic metabolite formation, inhibitory 
costs and generation of secondary waste streams. Ther efore, in this study, microbial fuel 
cells (MFCs) were studied as possible systems that could effectively degrade azo dyes 
with an additional benefit of concomitant biogenic electricity generation.  
The co -metabolic degradation of the model azo dye Acid Or ange -7 (AO -7) using 
Shewanella oneidensis  and mixed anaerobic cultures in MFC was carried out with 
particular emphasis on AO -7 degradation kinetics in the initial study. The effect of using 
various carbon sources including cheaper complex ones such as mola sses and corn 
steep liquor as electron donors for azo dye degradation in MFCs was also investigated. 
The outcomes of this study demonstrated that fast AO -7 reductive degradation kinetics 
using cheap, sustainable co -substrate types can be achieved with conc omitant 
bioelectricity generation in two -chamber MFCs. Power densities up -to 37 mWm-2 were 
observed in the two -chamber MFC system during AO -7 decolourisation.  
Co-metabolic reductive degradation of azo dye mixtures using dye acclimated mixed 
microbial popu lations under industri ally relevant conditions  (high temperatures and 
salinities ) and  changes in microbial community structure in the MFCs in presence of 
complex azo dye mixtures in two -chamber MFCs was investigated. The outcomes of this 
work demonstrated th at efficient colour and organic content  removal can be achieved 
under high tem peratures and moderate salinities using azo dye adapted mixed microbial 
populations in two -chamber MFCs. Microbial community analysis of the origi nal anaerobic 
consortium and  the azo dye adapted microbial culture following MFC operation indicated 
that both  cultures were dominated by bacteria belonging to the phylum Firmicutes. 
However, bacteria belonging to phyla Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes also became 
selected following MFC operation. Peak power densities up -to 27 mWm-2 were  observed 
in this study dur ing decolourisation of complex azo dye mixtures.  
The c omplete degradation of the  azo dye AO -7 using a sequential reductive – oxidative 
bioprocess in a combined MFC -aerobic bioreactor system operating at ambient 
temperature in continuous mode was studied . The outcomes of this study demonstrated 
that the azo dye AO -7 can be fully decolourised and degraded into non -toxic and simpler 
metabolites. Maximum po wer densities up -to 52 mWm-2 were  observed  during azo dye 
degradation.  A modular scale -up version (with a volumetric scale -up factor of 6) of the two 
stage integrated bioreactor system demonstrated the capability to efficiently treat two 
types of real wastewater originating from colour industry  without  any apparent 
deterioration  of reactor performance in terms of dye decolourisation and COD removal.  
The use of applied  external resistance (R ext) and redox mediators as tools for enhancing 
azo dye degradation kinetics  in dual chamber MFCs was studied . The outcomes of this 
work suggest that azo dye reductiv e degradation kinetics in MFC anodes can be 
influenced by varying R ext. Furthermore, AO -7 reductive degradation kinetics was 
improved in a concentration -dependent manner by exogenous addition of two electron 
shuttling compounds anthraquinone -2,6-disulfonic  acid and anthraquinone -2-sulfonic acid  
in MFC anodes.  
The overall outcomes of this study  implies that MFCs could be successfully applied for 
achieving enhanced azo dye reductive biodegradation kinetics in MFC anodes coupled 
with concomitant bioelectricity  generation.  It further demonstrated that MFC systems can 
be successfully integrated with existing wastewater treatment technologies such as 
activated sludge systems for complete degradation and toxicity removal of azo dyes and 
their biotransformation meta bolites.  II

 1.1. Dyes and the history of the colour industry  
Dyes impart colour to various materials such as textile, paper and leather in a way 
that the colour is not readily altered by factors such as washing, light or heat. Prior 
to the industrial revolution, all dyes that were in h uman use were produced from 
natural sources. Written records of the first use of dyes and colouring agents run 
as far back in history as 4600 years in ancient C hina and ancient Egypt. When 
Alexander the Great’s army conquered th e Persian capital of Susa in  331 BCE, 
they took custody of vast stocks of magnificent purple dyed royal robes. By the 
time of the Alexander the Great’s conquest of the Persian Empire, the colour 
industry utilising many natural dyes was a thriving industry in that part of the 
ancient worl d. A myriad of colours were provided by natural sources. A bright 
yellow/flavonoid colour originating from Reseda luteola  (weld) seeds and 
blue/indigo colour originating from Indigofera tinctoria  (indigo plant) leaves are a 
few examples of natural dyes that were used to colour textiles, walls and other 
materials throughout the ancient world.  
Following the industrial revolution, synthetic dyes started to replace the natural 
dyes from colour industry processes. In 1856, William Henry Perkins (Figure  1.2) 
synthesised the first synthet ic dyestuff –aniline based cationic  dye called 
Mauveine while trying to synthesize the antimalaria l drug quinine (Tyagi and 
Yadav , 2001). The first synthetic azo dye Bismarck Brown was synthesised by the 
German industrial chemist Johann Peter Griess in the year 1858 (Figure 1.1).  
 3

The emergence of a vast variety of synthetic dyes including azo dyes soon 
followed after these discoveries and transformed the colour industry in a major 
way. Synthetic dyes were cheaper to produce, offered a large variety of colours 
and could be made available in vast quantities for the rapidly expanding and highly 
profitable colour industry. These advancements displaced the natural dye s from 
the industrial market and synthetic dyes replaced them rapidly.

colour industry due to his invention of the first ever synthetic dye Mauveine.

Since the industrial revolution, thousands of different types of synthetic dyes 
bearing a vast variety of properties are chemically synt hesise d and are made 
available in substantial  quantities for the colour industry. The extent of the use of 
4 
 synthetic dyes spans from textile industry, where it is used in most quantities to 
paper and leather industries. Other industrial sectors using synth etic dyes include 
food, petroleum and pharmaceutical industries.  
1.2. Types of synthetic dyes and their uses in the colour 
industry  
1.2.1. Basic dyes (cationic dyes)  
Basic dyes are cationic in nature and carry cationic groups such as –NR 3+ and 
=NR 2+. They  are mostly aniline based synthetic dyes  (Christie , 2001) . Due to the 
cationic nature of the basic dyes, they are well suited for dyeing anionic fibres 
such as acrylic fibres and less well used in dyeing wool or nylon. However, basic 
dyes are known for their intrinsic poor lightfastness and poor adherence to fibre 
substrates  (Shah and Jain , 1983) . Common basic dyes include methylene blue, 
safranin and crystal violet.  
1.2.2. Acid dyes  
Acid dyes are organic dyes bearing sulfonic, carboxylic or phenol groups that 
exhibit affinity to cationic sites of fibres. The fixation of the dye during the dyeing 
process is mainly due to salt formation between the anionic groups of the dye and 
cationic groups of the fibre substrate  (Christie , 2001) . During the dyeing proces s 
using acid dyes, the pH value of the dye bath is often reduced in order to maintain 
the amino groups of the fibre substrate in protonated state, hence, increasing the 
fixation of acid dyes to the fibres substrate  (Carpar et al , 2006) . Acid dyes are 
often  effective at dyeing wool, silk and nylon fibres, whereas they are ineffective 
when used with cellulosic fibre types such as cotton. Acid dyes comprises of 
synthetic dyes belonging to anthraquinone, azobenzene and triphenylmethane 
chemical classes  (Figure  1.3).  5 
  
Figure 1.3: Acid dyes belonging to different chemical classes (A) anthraquinone 
(Alizarin) (CAS No - 72-48-0) (B) azobenzene ( Methyl Orange ) (CAS No - 547-58-0) 
and (C) Triphenylmethane (Bromocresol green) (CAS No - 76-60-8) 
 
1.2.3. Direct dyes  
Direct dyes generally are relatively large dye molecules that are adhered to the 
fibre substrate by hydrogen bonding and Van der Waals attractions. Hence, 
slightly alkaline media and temperatures close to boiling point are used in dye 
baths in order to ens ure good affinity of the direct dye to its fibre substrate. 
Furthermore, salts such as Na 2SO 4, NaCl and Na 2CO 3 are often used in order to 
drive the direct dye on to the fibre substrate. Direct dyes are mostly used for 
cellulosic fibre substrates such as co tton and jute. However, due to the weak 
bonding affinities between the direct dye and the fibre substrate, they are known 
for poor washfastness and excessive dye wastage and discharge during dyeing 
processes  (Christie , 2001) .  
1.2.4. Reactive dyes  
Reactive dyes possess chemical substituent groups that can directly react and 
form covalent linkages with the fibre substrate. The covalent linkage of reactive 
dyes to their substrates gives them excellent washfastness. Moreover, cold 
reactive dyes enable the use of reactive dyes at room temperature. Unlike 
disperse dyes where high temperatures are required for dyeing process, cold 
6 
 reactive dyes allow high affinity to its fibre substrate under milder conditions. 
Therefore, reactive dyes are the most favoure d type of dye class amongst all dye 
types used in the colour industry and have seen widespread use within the 
industry  (Chiou and Li , 2003) . Common commercial examples of reactive dyes 
include Reactive Black -5 (CAS No - 17095 -24-8) and Reactive Red -3 (CAS No- 
23211 -47-4).  
1.2.5. Disperse dyes  
Disperse dyes are highly conjugated planer structures that are often insoluble in 
water. Disperse dyes are often finely ground with a dispersing agent and made 
available for dyeing in the form of aqueous suspensions  (Neamtu et al , 2004) . Due 
to the absence of ionising groups and planer structures of disperse dyes, they are 
well suited  for dyeing hydrophobic synthetic fibres such as acrylic, nylon, 
polyester and cellulose triacetate. Some examples of commercially used disperse 
azo dyes include Disperse Red -1 (CAS No - 2872 -52-8) and Disperse Orange -1 
(CAS No - 2581 -69-3).  
1.3. Azo compounds and their chemistry  
Majo rity of the synthetic dyes  currently being used in the colour industry belong to 
the azo chemical class  (Pan dey et al , 2007) . Azo compounds are characterized by 
its possession of one or more azo chemical moieties ( -N=N-). The azo linkages in 
a chemical compound could be flanked by alkyl or aryl groups. Despite azo 
chemical groups (-N=N-) being known as chromopho ric (colour bearing) chemical 
groups, for azo dyes to exhibit vividly different colours, several prerequisite 
chemical properties are necessary.    
 7 
 1.3.1. Azo dyes and colour  
In addition to bearing the azo chromophore, azo dyes are required to  exhibit 
resonance of electrons (de -localised  p-orbital electrons) in a conjugated aromatic 
ring system (Abrahart , 1977).  
When comparing the chromogenic properties of following two compounds, it 
becomes apparent that the presence of an azo chemical moiety alone wou ld not 
allow an organic compound to confer properties of a dye.  
 
Figure 1.4: Two compounds exemplifying an A) an alkyl azo compound and B) an 
aryl azo compound.  
 
The chromogenic properties of the aforementioned two compounds are dist inctly 
different because the alky l azo compound lacks a conjugated system and 
resonance of electrons. Hence, alkyl azomethane is colourless whereas aryl 
azobenzene is orange in colour  (Figure  1.4). 
8 
 1.3.2.  Azobenzenes and the effect of chemical substituent groups 
of the ary l rings on colour  
In addition to possessing chromophoric groups, many organic dyes including azo 
dyes possess auxochromes which cause the colour of a dye to shift towards either 
end of the visible spectrum. Examples of auxochromes include carboxylic and 
sulfonic acid groups, amino, nitro and hydroxyl substituent groups of the aryl rings. 
Therefore, auxochromes are used as aryl ring substituents that can give target 
colours in organic dyes. Furthermore, auxochromes are used to influence the 
water solubility of the organic dye. For an example, substituting an aryl ring of an 
azo dye with electron donating chemical groups (such as –NH 2) prompts the dye 
to exhibit a bathochromic shift (shift of the emission spectrum towards a longer 
wavelength). By contrast, the  presence of an electron withdrawing chemical 
groups (such as –OH groups) on azo dye aryl rings prompts the opposite effect 
(Hypsochromic shift)  (Towns , 1999) . This becomes apparent by observing the 
bathochromic shift of absorbance maxima (λ max) of structu rally similar azo dyes 
carrying different substituent groups at the same position of the aryl ring  (Figure  
1.5). 
 
Figure 1.5: The bathochromic shift of –OH substituted azobenzene from 347nm to 
386nm when azobenzene is substituted with –NH 2 group at the same position of 
the aryl ring.  
9 
 1.3.3. The extent of production and usage of azo dyes in colour 
industry  
As of 2009, the annual global production of synthetic dyes exceeded 900,000 
tonnes (Chequer et  al, 2009) and is expected to be well ove r a million tonnes per 
annum at present. Nearly two -thirds (60% - 70%) of all synthetic dyes are azo 
dyes (Van der Zee et al , 2001). Therefore, azo dyes are considered as the most 
commonly used dyestuff in the colour industry. Moreover, a vast variety numb ering 
over 10,000 chemically different azo dyes are currently being used in the colour 
industry. Most azo dye precursors are produced from primary aromatic products 
obtained from the distillation process of coal tar. Diazotization reactions of 
aromatic dia zonium compounds are mainly used for synthesis of many azo dyes 
(Tyagi and Yadav , 1990 ).  
The preference for azo dyes over other dye types in the colour industry is due to 
their industrially desirable prope rties such as ease and  low cost of synthesis and 
being available in vast variety of colours. Other desirable properties include high 
washfastness and lightfastness.  
1.3.4. Azo dye contaminated wastewater disposal and legislation 
pertaining to colour industry wastewater dischar ge 
During the dyeing processes in colour industry, up -to 50% of the used dyes may 
not be fixed to their fibre substrates and hence may be washed out to form highly 
coloured effluent streams (Figure 1.6). The discharge of synthetic dye containing 
wastewater is not desirable due to several reasons. Firstly, the high colour 
intensity of many synthetic dyes may interfere with penetration of sunlight when 
mixed with natural waterstreams and may hinder photosynthesis and disrupt 
ecosystems. Hence, highly coloured waterst eams are undesirable in terms of  10 
 aesthetic and biodiversity perspectives.  Secondly, majority of synthetic dyes are 
highly recalcitrant in the natural environment. They are not naturally encountered 
by the microbes in the environment and hence, are not easily biodegraded. 
Furthermore, synthetic dyes are resistant to photolysis and can withstand high 
temperatures. Therefore, they tend to accumulate in the environment and impart 
harmful effects in the biosphere. Recalcitrant azo dyes may undergo partia l 
biotransformation into other compounds if discharged untreated. The dyes 
themselves and/or their biotransformation products are demonstrated to be toxic 
and in many instances carcin ogenic in nature (Mansour et al , 2009). Benzidine 
and 1 -phenylazo -2-hydro xynaphthalene (Sudan dyes) based dyes are especially 
noted for their genotoxic and mutagenic potential  (Weber, 1991) . The genotoxic 
nature of these dyes and their biotransformation products is often attributed to 
their planar structure and their ability to  intercalate between DNA double helices 
(Mansour et a l, 2009). Therefore, the use of benzidine based azo dyes is banned 
in Europe.  
For example, in Turkey, where its textile products accounts for up-to 14% of the 
total European textile imports, it is estima ted that approximately 150 million tonnes 
of dye contaminated wastewater is produced a nnually (Ozkan -Yucel and Gokcay , 
2013). Therefore, treatment of effluent water containing synthetic dyes (and other 
pollutants) from industries such as textile, leather/t annery, paper printing and 
cosmetic industries is environmentally important and enforced legally. Recently 
there has been an increase in environmental awareness from the public leading to 
more stringent legislation pertaining to uncontrolled industrial was te release into 
the natural environment (Christie, 2007).  11 
  
Figure 1.6: A highly coloured wastewater stream from the textile industry being 
released unlawfully into a natural waterway (source – www.sophied.net )  
 
The discharge of azo compounds, along with other pollutants, into water streams 
is one of the concerns highlighted in the Water Framework Directive (WFD 
2000/60/EC) and is strictly regulated by environmental regulatory agencies such 
as the UK Environment Agenc y. Regulations specified under (EC) 1907/2006 
directive prohibits discharge of many industrially used azo compounds to the 
environment (Christie, 2007). The permissible standards for textile colouring 
industry effluent as specified by Water Framework Direc tive (WFD) and DEFRA 
(Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs) are as follows; pH 5.5 -9, 
Chemical Oxygen Deman d (COD) – 250 mg L-1 and Biochemical  Oxygen Demand 
(BOD) – 30 mg L-1 (eco-web.com). However, typical untreated textile industry 
effluent h as been reported to possess  characteristics shown in table 1.1. Hence, 
treatment is essential prior to disch arge into natural water streams.  
 
 
 
12 
 Table 1.1: Typical properties of un treated textile wastewater (Adel  et al, 2004)  
 
1.4. Problem statement  
Due to the low levels of fixation of azo dyes to their substrate, up to 50% of the 
initial dye mass used may remain in the spent dye bath in a form which no longer 
has affinity for  the substrate. Since the dyes cannot be reused in the dyeing 
process, they are usually discarded, along with other process wastewater, a s 
effluent. Azo dyes are mostly regarded as  recalci trant environmental pollutants  
due to their xenobiotic nature. Hence  they can accumulate in ecosystems, be 
transferred along food chains and may cause harmful effects to human health. 
Some azo dyes such as dinitroaniline orange and orthonitroaniline orange are 
reported to  be mutagenic and some have  been shown to be linked to basal cell 
carcinoma (a common type of skin cancer) (Engel et al,. 2008). Benzidine -derived 
azo dyes are carcinogens and their use is discontinued from western industr ialised 
countries (Pandey et al , 2007). Wastewater containing azo dyes is usually Parameters  Values

 intensely coloured and this not only affects the aesthetics of the receiving water 
bodies but also reduces the solubility of oxygen in water. Azo dy e concentrations 
as low as 1 mg L-1 are highly visible and therefore, the colour intensity prevents 
sunlight from  penetrating through the water to reach plants , algae and other 
photosynthetic organisms growing on river beds, thus affecting aquatic life. Azo 
dye containing wastewater is usually complex and may contain particulates, high 
salt concentrations and low/hig h pH all of which pose problems to conventional 
wastewater treatment methods. Due to these environmental risks of synthetic dye 
wastewater discharge and already stringent legal requirements, it is imperative 
that colour industry wastewater is treated to an  acceptable standard recognised by 
environment agencies before being released to the environment.  
1.5. Current methods for treatment of colour industry 
wastewater  
Due to environmental risks and legal obligations, colour industry wastewater 
need s to be tre ated for colour, organic compounds including toxic ones, inorganic 
ions such as nitrates, sulphates and phosphates and heavy metal ions. Several 
technologies are currently in use for colour and organics removal. These range 
from physic o-chemical degradatio n methods to biological degradation methods  
(Figure  1.8).  
1.5.1. Physico -chemical dye removal methods  
Advanced oxidation processes (AOP) utilising various strong oxidants is the most 
common physico -chemical approach to industrial dye removal  (Erkurt, 2010) . 
Oxidation of the azo ( -N=N-) bond and the flanking aryl rings has been achieved 
by subjecting the azo bond or the aryl rings to attack by free radicals such as OH · 14 
 created by free radical generating chemical species such as O 3 and H 2O2. UV light 
has been used in combination with strong oxidising agents in order to increase the 
efficiency of degradation process by photolysis; combinations such as O 3/H2O2, 
UV/H 2O2, UV/O 3, are currently in use for chemical treatment of azo dyes. In 
addition, F enton’s reagent (Fe2+/ H 2O2) has been used to oxidize azo dye 
contaminated  effluent waters (Petrova et al , 2008). The Fenton’s reaction is as 
follows;  
Fe2+ + H+ + H 2O2 → Fe3+ + H 2O + OH. -----------  (1) (El -Desoky et al , 2010)  
The oxidative free radical generating properties of H 2O2 is enhanced by the 
presence of Fe2+ that acts as a catalyst in mildly acidic solution. Hydroxyl radicals 
generated act as powerful non -specific oxidising agents that are capable of 
degrading a wide range of environmental pollu tants including synthetic dyes. Other 
chemical AOP methods utilise oxidising agents such as sodium hypochlorite. 
Chemical AOP methods are not sustainable at larger industrial scales due to high 
cost of oxidising reagents such as hydrogen peroxide and sodiu m hypochlorite. 
Moreover, the exact chemical nature of the products generated from chemical 
AOP oxidation of various environmental pollutants can be unpredictable (Dos 
Santos et al, 2007, Robinson et al , 2001). Therefore, the disposal of the resultant 
effluent can be problematic.  
Chemical reduction of azo dyes into their constituen t aminobenzene s is also 
possible using reductant chemical species such as sulphide, cysteine and Fe2+ 
(Ozkan -Yucel and Gokca y, 2013).  
Many industrial dye users in the UK use coagulation/flocculation methods coupled 
to dissolved air floatation (DAF). DAF processes are almost always combined to a 
coagulation/flocculation process where coagulants such as AlCl 3 or FeCl 3 are used 15 
 to coagulate the pollutants and air saturation of the aqueous medium containing 
the dye pollutant wastewater is used for phase separation. Using physico -chemical 
means  such as DAF  to treat azo dye contaminated industrial effluents is high in 
energy expenditu re, costly due to the high cost of chemical coagulants used and 
produces la rge amounts of sludge (Mu et al , 2009). Coagulat ion/flocculation 
processes can  be slow depending on the operational conditions s uch as pH and 
hence, it is  difficult to implement to larger dye wastewater volumes  (Vandevivere 
et al, 1998) .  
Adsorption of synthetic dyes is another physico -chemical method that utilises a 
range of adsorbents such as activated carbon, wood chips, clay, rice hulls and 
inactivated microbial biomass. Adsorpti on and biosorption methods using support 
materials such as activated carbon and inactivated biomass also leads to disposal 
problems of the spent sorbent. Using adsorbents such as activated carbon is 
known to be particularly costly and regeneration of the s orbent material c an be a 
problem (Robinson et al , 2001). Adsorption of polar and charged dyes such as 
reactive dyes however, have proven to be problematic with conventional low -cost 
adsorbents such as wood chips and inactivated biomass due to the excessive ly 
hydrophilic nature of charg ed dyes (Ozkan -Yucel and Gokcay , 2013). Membrane 
filtration has also been used but it is very expensive and leaves a concentrated 
dye stream which requires further treatment prior to disposal. Membrane filtration 
is also known  to be rapid and highly successful at laboratory scales but ineffective 
at larger industrial scales due to high cost and intrinsic pitfalls of the process such 
as membrane  fouling and clogging (Wu et al , 1998).  
1.5.2. Electrochemical removal of synthetic dyes  
Electrochemical removal of environmental pollutants including azo dyes involves 
passing an electrical current via electrodes through an aqueous solution 16 
 containing the target pollutant that will result in oxidation or reduction reactions. In 
addition to electro -oxidation and electro -reduction, processes such as electro -
coagulation and electro -flocculation could also lead to removal of  target pollutants 
(Banat et al , 1996). Conventional coagulation phase separation techniques used 
for dye removal involv es the introduction of Fe3+ or Al3+ ions and hydroxyl ions in 
the form of NaOH or soda lime into the contaminated water, leading to 
precipitation of dye pollutants. In electrocoagulation methods however, Fe or Al 
sacrificial anodes are routinely employed s o that during the electrochemical 
process, Fe3+ or Al3+ ions are generated at the anode and OH- ions are generated 
at the cathode and they act as coagul ants of dye pollutants (Tarr , 2003). Varying 
the current density of the electrochemical cell can be used  as a control measure 
for the release of metal ions required for coagulation reactions from the sacrificial 
anodes.   
Electrochemical cells in which reductive and oxidative degradation of synthetic 
dyes takes place, several electrode materials can be utili sed. Activated carbon, 
graphite felt,  platinum, titanium (Chou et al , 2011), steel, polypyrrole and boron 
doped diamond (BDD) (Lopes et al , 2004) are the most common types of 
electrodes used for electrochemically assisted dye removal.  
Other electrochemical  methods such as electro -Fenton processes photo -assisted 
electro -Fenton processes where hydrogen peroxide and Fe2+ are generated in -situ 
within the electrochemical cell have also gained considerable interest for synthetic 
dye removal from wastewater (Guiva rch et al, 2003, Xie et al , 2006).  All 
electrochemical methods however, require a large input of electrical energy in 
order to achieve pollutant removal or degraration of the target pollutant.    
 17 
 1.5.3. Biological degradation methods  
Biological methods are  attractive in the sense that they require low energy input, 
low cost and are environmentally more acceptable than physico -chemical 
methods. Whole cell microorganisms and fungi as well as enzymes have been 
used. The dyes can be degraded reductively or oxid atively.  
1.5.4. Reductive degradation of azo dyes  
Reduction of azo bonds by various microorganisms under anaerobic conditions 
leads to the formation of aminobenzenes which may subsequently be mineralised 
oxidatively. Reductive degradation of azo moieties in synthetic dyes leads to the 
formation of corresponding aminobenzenes as shown in the expression  2. 
Reduction can be carried out by different mechanisms such as enzymes, redox 
mediators (mediated electron transfer into the –N=N- moiety) and biogenic 
reductant molecule s such as sulfide (Pandey et al , 2007)  (Figure  1.7). Several 
species of bacterial genera such as Clostridium, Eubacterium  and some yeasts 
and fungi are capable of producing NADPH/NADH dependant non -specific 
Azobenzene reductases that have  the capability of r educing azo bonds (Pandey et 
al, 2007). Azo bonds are proposed to be operational as an electron sink or a 
terminal electron acceptor during the process of anaerobic ATP generation for 
cellular energy requi rements (Chengalroyan and Dabbs , 2013, Doble and Kumar , 
2005). Biological and chemical reduction of the azo moiety can be represented in 
the following general formula.  
R-N=N-R’ + 4H+ +4e- → R-NH 2 + R’-NH 2 ---------  (2)   18 
  
Figure 1.7: Modes of azo dye reductive degradation in biotic environments under 
anaerobic conditions. Biogenic sulphide present in sulphate reducing anaerobic 
environments leads to direct chemical reduction of azo moieti es (adapted from – 
Pandey et al , 2007).  
The re ductive equivalents for the azo bond reduction could be provided from the 
oxidation of numerous carbon sources. Sugars such as glucos e, sucrose, lactose 
(Jain et al , 2012), organic acids such as pyruvate, acetate  and benzoic acid 
(Murali et al , 2013) and a mino acids such as cysteine (Logan et al , 2005) were 
reported as the carbon sources for azo dye degradation in several previous 
studies. Several complex unrefined electron donors such as molasses, rapeseed 
cake, co rn-steep liquor and starch (Jain et al , 2012) were also reported.  
It is widely accepted that the anaerobic reductive cleavage only leads to the 
decolourisation of an azo compound rather than its mineralisation. Anaerobic azo 
dye reduction is routinely reported in literature in both immobilised (e .g. Upflow 
Anaerobic Sludge Blanket -UASB) and suspended biophase reactors. However, 
the rate of subsequent mineral ization (i.e. of aminobenzenes ) under anaerobic 
conditions is very slow.  
19 
 Although colourless, the direct discharge of aminobenzene containing wastewater 
is not legally permitted due to high toxicity of aminobenzenes. The environme ntal 
toxicity of aminobenzenes  ranks very high among other well -known environmental 
pollutants. The toxicity of mono -substituted benzenes to acetoclastic methanogens 
were found to be in the following order:  COOH < H < OH < NH 2 < NO 2, (Razo -
Flores , 1997) where nitrobenzenes are also converted to aminobenzenes under 
anaerobic conditions. This clearly shows the highly toxic nature of aminobenzenes 
and hence it is necessary  they are further broken down to other less toxic 
compounds. Ortho substituted aminophenols such as 1 -amino -2-naphthol are 
thought to be toxic and mutagenic (Gottlieb et al, 2003 , Ruiz-Arias et al, 2010 ). 
However, the toxic/mutagenic nature of such aminobe nzenes is not well 
established and is subject to debate. Therefo re, it is necessary to explore the 
environmental toxicity  of these aminobenzenes.  
Metabolic oxidation of the dyes by bacteria is reported to be very difficult as the 
molecules are too big to be assimilated through the cell membranes of most wild -
type microorganisms used to date. Genetically engineered bacteria such as 
Xenophilus azovorans  KF46F and Pseudomonas aeru ginosa  K22 are two 
examples that are capable of azo dye degradation under a erobi c conditions 
(Pandey et al , 2007). However, it is thought that the decolourisation occurs under 
microaerophillic conditions in isolated microaerophillic zones within the culture 
broth by reductive cleavage of the azo moiety. Several non -specific enzymes, 
isolated from aerobic organisms such as Bacillus  spp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa  
and Staphylococcus aureus , have been reported to possess the capability o f 
reducing azo bonds (Ooi et al , 2007). It is widely known that most azo dyes pass 
unchanged through aerobic wastewater treatment processes such as activated 
sludge systems. It is known that conventional biological wastewater treatment 20 
 technologies such as anaerobic digesters or activat ed sludge systems are 
incapable of effectively neutralising the environmental toxicity of majority of the 
synthetic dyes. Combined anaerobic - aerobic processes were shown to degrade 
azo dyes in  previous studies (Khehra et al , 2006), however the anaerobic process 
is too slow and some of the produced amines may be toxic to the aerobes in the 
subsequent process. The aerobic further degradation of monocyclic 
aminobenzene s is thought to proceed via the formation of catechol derivatives as 
shown in several pr evious studies (Junker et al, 1994, Kalme et al , 2007). The 
aromatic ring activation reactions carried out by mono -oxygenase and di -
oxygenase enzymes prompt aromatic ring opening and further degradation of 
amines. Highly substituted aminobenzene s however, can  exhibit extensive 
resistance to biodegradation and therefore, could pose environmental problems.  
An extensive amount of work exists on oxidation of dyes using fungal species, 
especially white rot fungi such as Pleurotus ostreatus and Trametes versicolor  (Fu 
and Viraragharan, 2001; www.sophied.net) or their enzymes – laccases, 
peroxidases  (Teerapatsakul et al , 2008). Although fungal oxidases are reported to 
be able to act non -specifically on many azo dyes, the terminal degradation 
products of fungal oxidat ion of azo compounds could be more toxic than the 
parent dyes. Another drawback with fungal cultures is that they require rather long 
growth phases before actually producing high amounts of active enzymes.  
Therefore, it is clear that novel and innovative a venues of better treating colour 
industry wastewater must be sought in order to alleviate the environmental 
damage caused by the uncontrolled discharge of synthetic dyes. The current 
methods that are employed for colour industry wastewater treatment are 
summerised in figure 1.8.  21

industrial wastewater (adapted fro m – Martinez -Huitle and Brillas , 2009)

 1.6. Use of Bioelectrochemical systems for azo dye 
removal  
From the foregoing discussion, it is apparent that there is need to develop more 
effective and eco -friendly treatment methods for azo dye containing wastewater  
due to the limitations of current wastewater treatment technologies when used for 
the treatment of azo dye contamin ated wastewater . Recently, Bioelectrochemical 
systems (BES) have bee n proposed as a promising alternative  of not only 
wastewater treatment but also concomitant energy production (Roze ndal et al, 
2008; Hawkes et al , 2010).  
1.6.1. Bio-electrochemical system s and microbial fuel cells (MFC)  
Bio-electrochemical systems use microbes to catalyse oxidation and reduction 
reactions at the anode and cathodes respectively in electrochemical cells. They 
are unique systems that could convert the chemical energy of biode gradable 
organic contaminants in wastewater to biogenic electricity (MFCs) or to 
hydrogen/ value -added chemical products in microbial electr olysis cells (MECs) 
(Pant et al , 2012).  
1.6.2. Microbial fuel cells and the history of Bioelectrochemical 
systems  
Microbial fuel cells are BES that utilise micro -organisms e.g. Shewanella, 
Geobacter, Rhodoferax , yeasts and mixed microbial populations to catalyse an 
oxidation and reduction reaction at an anode and cathode electrode respectively 
and can produce electricit y when connected to a load/resistor via an external 
circuit (Figure 1.9a).  23 
 Observations of electrochemical phenomena relating to biological sys tems are not 
new. In  1771, the Italian physicist Luigi Galvani observed that a dead frog’s legs 
would twitch when a small current was passed through it with the aid of electrodes. 
This observation is widely regarded as the first reported instance of a bioelectrical 
phenomenon  (Ieropoulos et al , 2005). Thereafter, in 1911, M.C Potter 
demonstrated that electrical energy can be produced in electrochemical cells by 
living cultures of Escherichia coli  and Saccharomyces cerevisiae  with the aid  of 
platinum electrodes (Potter , 1911). Potter’s study is currently regarded as the first 
instance where the concept of MFCs was experimentally demonstrated. 
Subsequent to this breakthrough study by Potter in 1911, the concept of 
electrochemical phenomena involving microbes was largely overlooke d or 
neglected for many decades. Aside from a handful of studies such as Cohen , 1931 
and Berk  et al, 1964, very little scientific interest was given to the electrochemical  
phenomena involving microbial metabolism  until early 1980s. Following the 
intense debate on the looming energy crisis and the current extent of the 
environmental damage occurring due to industrialisation and extensive fossil fuel 
burning, a renewed interest was placed on environmentally cleaner and more 
sustainable alternatives for energy  generation and environmental remediation. In 
this context, biofuels and other alternative environmentally sustainable 
technologies were given the primary emphasis. Research on MFCs and other BES 
was reinvigorated due to aforementioned reasons by many lead ing research 
institutions world -wide after many years of lapse following the breakthrough study 
by Potter. MFCs and BES had an additional appeal of environmental remediation 
and contaminant removal coupled with concomitant electricity /biohydrogen  
generatio n. In this view, MFCs are unique systems that are capable of converting 
the chemical energy of contaminants to usable biogenic electrical energy.  24 
 1.6.3. Working principle of MFCs  
MFCs generally comprise of an anode, a cathode, an external circuit and an io n 
selective membrane separating th e anode and the cathode (Figure 1.9). In brief, 
organic substrates such as glucose and acetate are oxidised at the anode end of 
the MFCs by microorganisms in the anode compartment. Electrons and protons 
are released due to the microbial catabolism of organic substrates.  
C6H12O6 + 6H 2O → 24e- + 24H+ + 6CO 2 (∆G0 = -1438  kJ mol-1) --------  (3) 
C2H3O2- + 2H 2O → 8e- + 7H+ + 2CO 2 (∆G0 = -375 kJ mol-1) ----------  (4) 
The electrons are picked up by the anode electrode and flow through the external 
circuit into the cathode end of the MFC, where, a chemical species with a high 
redox potential such as oxygen or ferricyanide will accept electrons to undergo 
reduction. The p rotons produced in the process permeate into the cathode side of 
the MFC through an ion permeable membrane placed between the anode and 
cathode compartments. In the cathode, atmospheric oxygen is most often used as 
the electron acceptor where it undergoes reduction as follows.  
O2 + 4e- + 4H+ → 2H2O ----------  (5) 
In order to catalyse the above reaction, various oxygen reducing catalyst materials 
are employed. The most common cathode catalyst material is Platinum. However, 
due to the high cost of platinum catalyst material, the use of alternative cheaper 
catalyst ma terials is preferred for MFCs. Alternative cheaper cathode catalysts 
demonstrated to have a promising potential include cobalt 
tetramethylphenylporphyrin (CoTMPP) (Cheng et al, 2005), metal phthalocyanine 
(PC) derivatives such as FePC , activated carbon (Ha oYu et al , 2007) and 
biological catalyst materials such as peroxidase enzymes su ch as laccases 
(Schaetzle et al , 2009).  25 
  
Figure 1.9: The working principle of a microbial fuel cell (MFC) and microbial 
electrolysis cell (MEC) and microbially catalysed direct electron transfer from 
substrate oxidation onto electrode surfaces (im age adapted from Rozendal et al , 
2008)  
 
Electron transfer to the anode electrode is thought to occur by several different 
mechanisms. Electron transfer could be mediated through various natural or 
synthetic electron shuttles or redox mediators. Natural electron shuttles include 
compounds such as r iboflavin (Velasque z-Orta et al , 2010)  and humic acid 
(Thygesen et al , 2009). Well studied synthetic electron shuttles include 
anthraquinone -2,6-disulfonic  acid (AQDS) (Aeschbacher et al , 2009) and 
anthraquinone -2-sulfo nic acid (AQS) (Tsujimura et al , 2001). Direct electron 
transfer to the anode occurs through microbial membrane -bound electron transfer 
proteins such  as Mtr cytochrome protein complexes and so -called nanowires, 
26 
 microbial pilli -like extracellular electrically conduc tive appendages (Schroder et al , 
2007).  
1.6.4.  Thermodynamics of MFCs  
In order to produce electrical energy in MFCs, the overall reaction of the bio -
electrochemical cell must be thermodynamically favourable. Gibbs free energy of 
the electrochemical reaction is a measure that can be used in order to as sess the 
feasibility of an MFC system to produce electricity. Gibbs free energy is calculated 
as follows.  
ΔG r = ΔG0
r + RT.lnΠ --------------  (6) 
Where, ΔG r is the Gibbs free energy (J) of the reaction at specific conditions, ΔG0
r 
is the Gibbs free e nergy ( J) at standard conditions  (298.15 K temperature, 1 bar 
pressure and 1M concentrations of all chemical species), R is the universal gas 
constant (8.31447 J mol-1 K-1), T (Kelvins) is the absolute temperatur e and Π is the 
equilibrium constant .  
The amount of  useful work that can be obtained from the electrochemical 
reactions of an MFC is related to the electromotive force (E emf) of the system. 
Electromotive force is also defined as the potential difference between the anode 
and the cathode of an electrochemic al cell.  
Eemf = - ΔG r/nF -----------------  (7) 
Where, n is the number of electrons transferred per reaction and F is the 
Faraday’s constant (9.64853 X 104 Cmol-1). 
Under standard conditions (where Π = 1), the EMF can be written as follows.  
E0
emf = - ΔG0
r/nF -------------------  (8) 27 
 Where, E0
emf is the EMF at standard conditions.  
Therefore, from equation s (7) and (8) the EMF for the overall reaction could be 
written as:  
Eemf = E0
emf – (RT/nF) ln(Π) -----------  (9)  
When individual anode and cathode half cel ls of the MFC are considered:  
Eemf = E cathode  – Eanode --------------  (10) 
For an MFC operating under ideal conditi ons utilising 5mM acetate at pH 7 in the 
anode as the sole electron donor and a cathode utilising oxygen as the sole 
electron acceptor at atm ospheric pressure (pO 2 = 0.2) at pH 7: 
Anode  
2HCO 3- + 9H+ + 8e- → CH 3COO- + 4H 2O; E anode = -0.296 V ---------  (11) 
Cathode  
O2 + 4e- + 4H+ → 2H2O; E cathode  = 0.805 V ----------  (12) 
 From equatio n (10), E emf of this MFC is:  
= 0.805 – (-) 0.296 = 1.106 V  
Therefore, MFCs utilising acetate as the electron donor and atmospheric oxygen 
as the sole electron acceptor under aforementioned conditions, it is widely 
accepted that theoretical electromotive force or open circuit potential (OCV) would 
neve r exceed 1.1 Volts (Logan et al , 2006). In an ideal MFC therefore, the open 
circuit potential would equal to the thermodynamic E emf value calculated using the 
potentials of anode and cathode half cells.  28 
 1.6.5. Internal losses of MFCs and OCV  
In real MFCs however, the OCV never reaches the thermodynamically calculated 
theoretical value due to several inherent limitations of BES. These limitations are 
referred to as overpotentials. Therefore, in order to reduce the effect of 
overpotentials and to optimise the energy effi ciency of bioelectrochemical 
systems, a good level of understanding relating to internal losses of BES is 
needed. The overpotentials  in MFC systems are categorised into four main areas . 
They are activation overpotentials, Ohmic losses, bacterial metabolic losses and 
concentration polarisation losses (Rabaey and Verstraete , 2005).  
Activation overpotentials are related to the activation energies of anodic and 
cathodic oxidation/reduction  reactions. Activation losses could relate to the 
compounds undergoing oxidation in the anode and where the microbially 
catalysed electron transfer occurs. This could be related to electron carrying cell 
surface proteins or electron shuttling mediator comp ounds. Activation losses could 
also occur at the cathode where electrons are coupled with a final electron 
acceptor. Improving electrode catalysis and increasing electrode surface areas are 
general strategies used in order to circumvent the adverse effects  of activation 
losses to MFC performance.  
Concentration losses occur mainly due to mass transport limitations of the 
reactants to or from the electrodes and due to the formation of concentration 
gradients perpendicular to the plane of the electrode. When s ufficient mixing of the 
surrounding electrolyte is absent, the process of simple diffusion becomes 
inadequate for efficiently transporting reactants to the electrode and products 
away from the electrode. This leads to the formation of concentration gradien ts of 
reactants and products and is a major contributor for concentration losses in 29 
 MFCs. Therefore, adequate mixing of the bulk electrolyte is essential for 
minimising the concentration related losses in MFC systems.  
Ohmic losses of an MFC system is rela ted to the resistance to flow of electrons 
and counter ions through electrodes, external circuit, electrode interconnections, 
ion selective membranes and the electrolyte. Electrode spacing and solution 
conductivity are primarily important in reducing Ohmic  losses. It has been shown 
that electrode spacing and Ohmic losses exhibit an inver se relationship (Rozendal 
et al, 2008). Other factors such as high resistivity of the ion selective membrane 
and poor electrical interconnections (especially at the electrod es) could also 
contribute to high Ohmic losses in MFCs.  
Bacterial metabolic action in the anode results in release of electrons and protons 
from the organic substrates and the electrons being transferred down a redox 
potential gradient to a terminal electr on acceptor. In MFCs, the anode electrode 
acts as the terminal electron acceptor. When electrons are transferred from 
reduced substrates such as acetate (E’ 0 = -0.296V) or reduced electron carriers 
such as NADH (E’ 0 = -0.32V), the higher the potential diff erence between the 
electron donor and the electron acceptor (i.e. the anode) the energy gain for the 
anode microorganism will be higher. However, the voltage output of the MFC 
system will be lower. In order to maximise the OCV of the MFC, the potential of 
the anode must be kept as low as possible. Under very low anode potentials 
however, the anode bacteria may seek alternative terminal electron acceptors in 
the anolyte solution and the electrons may be diverted to fermentative or 
methanogenic metabolic path ways (Logan et al , 2006). Polarisation plots of MFCs 
are routinely used to assess the system performance and the energy losses 
occurring due to overpotentials can be approximately represented  graphically as 
shown in figure 1.10.  30 
  
Figure 1.10: Regions of a polarisation curve used to assess the MFC performance 
depicting the energy losses. Zone -1- activation losses, zone -2- Ohmic losses, 
Zone -3- concentration los ses (adapted from - Rabaey et al , 2005)  
 
As shown in the following equatio n, the observed cell voltage can be expressed as 
the difference between thermodynamically calculated electromotive force and the 
sum of anodic overpotential, cathodic overpotential and Ohmic losses of the MFC 
system.  
Ecell = E emf – (Ση a + / Ση c/ + IR Ω) --------------  (13)  
Where, Ση a and Ση c respectively are anode and cathode related overpotentials 
and IRΩ is the sum of all Ohmic losses which are proportional to the current drawn 
from the MFC system.  
1.6.6. Types of Microbial fuel cells 
Architecture and the material of construction of MFCs differentiated and evolved 
over many years of MFC related research. The design and construction of MFCs 
can make a considerable influence in terms of optimal performance, internal 
energy losses and the mode of operation (i.e. batch or continuous operation). One 
31 
 of the very first MFC designs included the conventional H -type configuration where 
two glass bottles were held clamped together between a glass bridge. The junction 
held an ion specific membrane o r an agar salt bridge and the glass compartments 
house the anode and cathode electrodes (Figure 1.11-A). There are several 
variations of the two chamber system where attempts were made to increase the 
available membrane surface area, electrode surface area  and to reduce the 
distance between electrodes (Figure 1.11-B) (Logan et al , 2006). The two -
chamber system is mostly suitable for fundamental studies due to its intrinsic 
limitations such as very high internal resistances and consequently, high internal 
energy losses and the limited ability to operate in the continuous -flow mode, 
hence, reducing its practical applicability for larger -scale real wastewater treatment 
processes. Other variations of two chamber MFCs include miniaturised reactors 
which are well suited for remo te sensing applications  (Ringeisen et al , 2006). In 
almost all two -chamber MFCs utilising atmospheric oxygen as the terminal 
electron acceptor, the catholyte is actively aerated in order to circumvent the low 
solubility of oxygen in the aque ous catholyte. This demands a further energy input 
into the operation of the MFC system and hence, reduces its energy efficiency.  
 
Figure 1.11: Types of two chambered microbial fuel cells (A) the conventional H -
type (B) the rectangular type two -chamber systems with high memb rane surface 
areas   
32 
 Single -chamber MFCs are a later development where the cathode was removed 
from the catholyte and was pla ced exposed to atmospheric oxygen and is 
passively aerated  (Logan et al , 2006) . The anode is housed within the single 
reactor compartment contai ning the anolyte medium (Figure 1.13). The single 
chamber type MFCs are more energy efficient compared to their two-chamber 
counterparts due to several reasons. The distance between the anode and the 
cathode is significantly reduced and no energy expenditure is required for active 
oxygenation of the catholyte as the cathode is passively aerated. Furthermore, 
anode a nd cathode surface areas could be considerably increased compared to 
two-chamber systems. Mono -chamber MFC systems could be considered as 
innovative reactor designs due to their efficiency and versatility they offer in terms 
of performance and operational standpoints. Hence, single -chamber air cathode 
type MFCs routinely  register higher power performance and are more sustainable  
compared to their two -chamber counterparts. Single chamber MFC systems ( such 
as tubular up -flow systems in particular) are well su ited for continuous -flow mode 
reactor operation.  
Other less commonly utilised MFC types include benthic/sediment deployed MFCs 
where the anode resides in the sediment and the cathode is exposed to 
atmospheric oxygen. The benthic MFCs use the sediment as t he source of 
substrate as well as the source of microbial inoculum. The sediment is rich in 
various microbial communities including ones that are capable of extracellular 
electron transfer. The electrochemically active microbes residing within the 
sediment  oxidise naturally found decomposing organic substrate and transfer a 
portion of the electrons released on -to the anode electrode of the benthic MFC, 
placed within the sediment. The electrons are then drawn towards the cathode 
electrode (placed exposed to atmospheric oxygen) via the external circuit. The 33 
 current generated within the external circuit is used to power various remote -
sensing devices. The major advantage of this type of MFCs is that they can be 
deployed for powering remote sensing and environme ntal monitoring devices as a 
reliable source of power and can be left unattended unlike using  conventional 
batteries (Figure 1.12).  
 
Figure 1.12: The working principle of a benthic MFC system and a b enthic MFC 
system being readied for deployment  in marine sediment for remote sen sing 
applications (Guzman et al , 2010).  
 
Sediment/benthic MFCs have gained much research interest in recent times due 
to their potential remote sensing applications in environmental, marine and military 
sectors.

concentric type cathode for continu ous flow operation (Logan et al , 2006).  
 
1.6.7. Microbial electrolysis cells  
Microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) are similar to MFCs but instead of the external 
load, they utilise a small external power source to bias the thermodynamics of the 
reactions occurring in the anode and cathode of BES (Figure 1.9b). MECs are 
mainly utilised for production of biohydrogen by microbially assisted electrolysis of 
water at the cathode of an MEC. Furthermore, MEC systems are also utilised for 
the production o f value added products such as Sodium hydroxide (Chen et al , 
35 
 2012), hydrogen peroxide (Foley et al, 2010), recovery of precious metals, and 
microbially assisted desalination  (Luo et al , 2010) . MECs may be useful in terms of 
(forcefully) transferring electr ons into the ( -N=N-) moiety of azo pollutants, 
resulting in reductive cleavage of the dye poll utant (Mu et al , 2009). Especially 
when the electron accepting azo dye possessing a low redox potential, an external  
power supply would be useful  for biasing ther modynamics towards the reductive 
azo moiety degr adation (as shown in expression 2).  
1.6.8. The use of BES for pollutant removal  
Although the primary aim of the majority of research involving BES is to enhance 
the generation of biogenic electricity (in the  case of MFCs) and cathodic hydrogen 
evolution (in the case of MECs), significant and growing amount of research is 
currently being devoted towards a variety of other applications of BES. Apart from 
the use of BES for the removal of more readily oxidisable  organics such as sugars, 
fatty acids and amino acids present in wastewater, increasing attention is now 
diverted towards the removal of more recalcitrant waste types. Particularly, the 
organic and inorganic wastes originating from various chemical industr ies tend to 
be more recalcitrant compared to wastes originating from the agricultural sector or 
the food industry. Different types of MFCs were used in either batch or continuous 
flow modes and both anodic and cathodic chambers were used in several previou s 
studies that demonstrated the ability of MFC systems to effectively degrade and in 
some instances, detoxify recalcitrant environmental pollutants. Some of the recent 
studies highlighting the use of BES  systems used for pollutant removal are 
summarise d in Table  1.2.

In addition t o the removal of organic xenobiotic environmental pollutants as listed 
above, several studies used BES for the purpose of removal of industrially 
important inorganic pollutants  such as sulphide (Rabaey et al, 2006) sulphate 
(Zhao et al , 2008) and Nitrate ( Virdis et al , 2008).  In the aforementioned studies 
carried out involvi ng azo dyes however, (Liu et al, 2009, Ding et al, 2010, Mu et al, 
2009 and Fu et al , 2010), MFCs were employed only for reductive degradation of 
azo dyes in either anode or the cathode compartments. Means for further 
degradation and detoxification of the resulting aminobenzene s were not explored 
in any of the studies. Further more, in som e studies (Mu et al , 2009), azo dye 
reduction process was assisted by exogenous supply of electrical energy. 
Therefore, means for full degradation and detoxification of azo dyes and their 
biotransformation products coupled with a sustainable approach (i.e.  with no 38 
 exogenous supply of electrical energy and utilising waste material as the energy 
source for BES) should be the focus of developing BES for treatment of colour 
industry wastewater.  
The removal of pollutants from wastewater in a sustainable fashion  has always 
been one of the top priorities for methods used for recalcitrant waste removal. In 
this view, most physic o-chemical waste treatment methods score poorly due to 
their intrinsic pitfalls such as very high energy expenditure, high cost of applicat ion 
and operation and generation of secondary waste products that lead to further 
disposal problems.   
Concomitant energy recovery in the form of electricity while removing azo dye 
pollutants from simulated effluent water has been reported in recent litera ture and 
is an interesting development in terms of the use of BES to achie ve pollutant 
removal (Liu et al , 2009).  
Most BES research involved the use of carbohydrates and organic acids e.g. 
acetate as a substrate. However, due to cost considerations, it is preferable to use 
unrefined substrate types such as nutrient  rich agricultural wastes (eg. m olasses, 
lignocellulosic material and rapeseed cake) for concomitant bioremediation of 
environmental pollutants and concomitant recover y of biogenic electrical ene rgy in 
MFCs.  
Current drawbacks of BES systems include low growth rate of microbes, electron 
diversion to methane formation, membrane pH gradients and electrode  potential 
losses (Rabaey et al , 2005). The microorganisms utilised in BES are unique in the 
sense that they can transfer electrons (from oxidation of organic matter) 
extracellularly to an insoluble electron acceptor  (e.g. electrode). The redox 
potential of the electron accepting chemical species or the electrode in BES is of 39 
 paramount importance in the view of efficient electron transfer from the oxidised 
organic substrate. The redox potential of the electron accepting electrode can be 
biased by suitable choice of oxidant in the cathode or by a power supply to 
improve electron transfer  (i.e. MECs) .  
The r edox potential of the dyes/electron acceptor was highlighted as a predictive 
measure of their biodegradability when dye degradation was  studied oxidatively 
using laccases or reduc tively using yeast (Zille et al , 2004).  The addit ion of redox 
mediators  is a possible  way by which electron transfer (hence azo dye reductive 
degradation  and MFC electrochemical performance ) could be improved. 
Bioaugmentation is a widely used strategy in bioremediation but it has not been 
fully e xploited in BES (Saratale et a l, 2010; www.biofuture.ie). The use of process 
integration by coupling different treatment systems together e.g. MFC + activated 
sludge could also aid the mineralization of azo dyes. Ultimately a system that is 
able to operate on real wastewaters on a larg e scale is required. So the influence 
of scale up on the performance of BES needs investigation. Since BES is a recent 
development, very little information exists regarding their potential for treatment of 
azo dye containing wastewater. (Liu et al,. 2009; Sun et al,.2009 and Li et al,. 
2010).  
1.7. Hypothesis  
Azo dye compounds in polluted industrial effluen t water can be fully degraded into 
non-toxic intermediates  using either BES alone or in conjunction with already 
existing wastewater treatment technologie s.  
1.8. Aims and objectives of the current project  
The overall aim of this project is to investigate the technical feasibility of 
bioelectrochemical systems, as a stand alone system or in conjunction with 40 
 conventional wastewater treatment processes, for treatment of azo dye -containing 
industrial wastewater.  
In order to achieve the aforementioned aim, research was directed through 
following specific  objectives.  
1.8.1.  Specific objectives  
1. To investigate  the co -metabolic reductive degradation of azo dyes in 
the anode of microbial fuel cells.  
For the initial study, the model mono azo dye Acid  Orange -7 (AO -7) was selected. 
Azo dyes are known to pass through aerobic biotreatment systems unchanged  
(Pandey et al , 2007) . Hence, the best strategy of completely d egrading azo dyes 
would be to employ a sequential reductive -oxidative degradation process. For this 
purpose, the reductive degradation of azo dyes with the aid of a co -substrate (i.e. 
electron donor for azo moiety reduction) in the anodes of MFCs was studi ed. Azo 
dyes that carry highly charged substituent groups (such as the sulfonate group  in 
AO-7) and with high molecular weight (some exceeding 1 kDa) are highly unlikely 
to cross largely non -polar biological membranes and enter the cellular interior of 
bacterial cells. Therefore, the reduction of azo moieties by means of transfer of 
electrons is likely to occur in the extracellular milieu (Cervantes and Dos Santos, 
2010, Pandey et al , 2007)  with electrons coming from a co -substrate ( i.e. glucose, 
acetate) . Furthermore, the ability of MFCs to use oxygen indirectly as the terminal 
electron acceptor also confers MFCs an additional advantage over conventional 
anaerobic systems in terms of faster microbial metabolic rates and growth rates 
that could potentially be beneficial in achieving faster azo dye degradation kinetics 
in MFC anodes. The azo dye degradation was analysed with respect to the 
kinetics of degradation, the nature of degradation products formed and the toxicity 41 
 of the formed intermediates. A pure culture of Shewanella oneidensis  MR-1 and 
anaerobic mixed cultures  were used as inocula. The effect  of using various un-
refined co substrate types as well as different  anode pH was also investigated.  
2. To investigate  the co -metabolic decolourisation of azo dye mixtures under 
industrially relevant conditions using dye -acclimated mixed microbial 
populations  
In real industrial scenarios, it is very unlikely that single azo dyes are encountered 
and the industrial wastewat er may exhibit certain extreme traits such as high 
temperatures and high salinities. Moreover, it is highly disadvantageous to utilise 
pure cultures for industrial wastewater treatment due to high cost and operational 
limitations. Therefore, in the second related study, the co -metabolic degradation of 
complex azo dye mixtures using a dye -acclimated mixed culture was investigated. 
Experimental conditions included a range of industrially relevant temperatures and 
salinities routinely encountered in colour ind ustry wastewater. Microbial community 
dynamics during MFC operation were investigated using 16s rDNA microbial 
community profiling methods.  
3. To examine the effect of process integration on azo dye degradation.  
A complete degradation and detoxification of azo dyes and their intermediates is 
desired. The aminobenzene s yielding from the reductive degradation of AO -7 in 
the MFC stage are expected to be amenable to further degradation into less toxic 
intermediates if  an aerobic treatment stage analogous to an activated sludge 
system is present. Therefore, a sequential MFC -aerobic integrated bioreactor 
system configuration was investigated for the full degradation of the model azo 
dye AO -7. Single -chamber tubular -type MFCs that are best suited for continuous 
flow operation were used for the study. An azo dye acclimated mixed microbial 
culture was used in the MFC stage in order to obtain optimum decolourisation of 42 
 the model azo dye. Other important aspects of operation s uch as the hydraulic 
retention time (HRT), dye loading rate, ability to operate at ambient temperature, 
long term operational stability of the integrated reactor system and the response of 
the reactor to sudden s hock loadings of the azo dye were  also inves tigated. The 
chemical nature and the toxicity of degradation products  were also studied . 
4. To evaluate the influence of scale up on treatment of azo dyes in 
bioelectrochemical systems (tubular air -breathing MFCs).  
To assess the potential industrial appli cability of the tested integrated MFC -aerobic 
integrated bioreactor system, it is essential to investigate the scalability of the 
system. For this purpose, a modular scale -up approach was used. The volumetric 
scale -up factor of 6 was used in the up -scaled reactor system. The reactor system 
was initially tested in continuous -flow mode at ambient temperature using AO -7 as 
the model azo dye. This was followed by feeding the reactor system with real 
industrial wastewater originating from colour industry. The re al wastewater used 
included wastewater collected from an acid dyebath for wool and an acid dyebath 
for leather. Colour and COD removal and concomitant bio -electricity generation 
was monitored during the feeding cycles of the model wastewater containing AO -7 
and the two types of real colour industry wastewater.  
5. To investig ate the effects of the exogenous addition of redox mediators 
and the effect of external resistance on azo dye reductive degradation in 
MFCs.  
Other factors that could affect azo dye dec olourisation rates in MFCs include the 
presence of redox mediators and the anode potential. Exogenous addition of 
synthetic redox mediators such as anthraquinone -2,6-disulfonic acid (AQDS) and 
anthraquinone -2-sulfonic acid (AQS) was investigated using a ra nge of 43 
 concentrations of these two compounds on the reductive decolourisation of AO7 in 
MFC anodes.  
The MFC anode potential is influenced by the applied external resistance and 
therefore, it could be used as a convenient tool to vary anode potential witho ut 
exogenous polarisation of the anode compartment. The effect of a range of 
external resistances were tested on the reductive decolourisation of three model 
azo dyes AO -7, Reactive Red -3 (RR -3) and Direct Yellow 106 (DY -106) in the 
anode compartments of M FCs.

 The real industrial wastewater used in the work described  in chapter 6 was 
obtained from a previous Europe -wide industrial study relating to colour industry 
wastewater treatment (Sophied project FP -6 http://www.sophied.net/ ). The 
industrial wastewater originated from two acid dyebaths in Europe used 
respectively for tanning of leather and colour fixation on wool fabrics. The exact 
dye content and other auxiliary components were unknown. Typical characteristics 
of the two industrial w astewaters are listed in Table  2.2.

2.2. Bacterial strains, their maintenance and MFC anode 
culture media  
Shewanella oneidensis  strain 14063 and Vibrio fischeri  strain 13938 were 
purchased from NCIMB (UK) and cryopreserved stock cultures were maintained at 
-80˚C. Anaerobic digested sludge samples were obtained from Mogden Sewage 
Treatment Works London (UK). Anaerobic sludge inoculum was initially grown in 
tryptic ase-soy broth and later sub -cultured into minimal medium (Tables 2.4 and 
2.5) supplemented with sodium pyruvate and casein hydrolysate. Vibrio fischeri  for 
bioluminescence toxicity assays was grown in oceanibulbus growth medium 
(NCIMB growth media catalogue) (Table 2.3). Histidine auxotroph strains 
Salmonella typhimurium  strain TA 1535 and strain TA 1538 for the soft agar 
overlay Ames mutagenicity test w ere obtained from the University of Westminster 
culture collection. Both S.typhimurium  strains were initially grown in Luria Bertani 
50 
 (LB) medium (Sigma Aldrich) and maintained as glycerol cryopreserved stock 
cultures at -80˚C.  
The original anaerobic mixed microbial consortium for the study described in 
chapter 4 was obtained from Mogden Sewage Treatment Works London (UK). The 
anaerobic microbial consortium was initially acclimated at 30˚C over a period of 
five months in a solution containing all 18 azo dyes  (each dye at 10 mgL-1) in 
Winogradsky columns (column height – 42cm) supplemented with microcrystalline 
cellulose (1% w/v) (Sigma Aldrich) as a carbon source. Dyes were replenished in 
the Winogradsky columns approximately every week after complete 
decolou risation of the solution was observed.  
The anolyte minimal salts medium for the study present ed in chapter 3 consisted 
of (gL-1) NH 4Cl, 0.46; KCl, 0.225;  NaH 2PO 4, 2.5;  Na2HPO 4, 4.11;  (NH 4)2SO 4, 0.225;  
1% (V/V) of the trace element solution  as described by Marsilli et al , 2008 and 0.3% 
(V/V) vitamin mix as described by Wolin et al , 1963. The anolyte minimal med ium 
was supplemented with 500 mg L-1 Casein hydrolysate (Sigma Aldrich UK) and 
20mM Sodium pyruvate as the primary carbon source. The vitamin stock solution 
(100X concentrated) for minimal media comprised of the following (Table 2.5).

 Simulated wastewater anolyte medium for the study presented in chapter 5 
containing a mixture of all 18 azo dyes (20 mgL-1 each dye, total dye content 360 
mgL-1) and molasses (4 gL-1) as a co -substrate was formulated in 50 mM, pH -7 
phosphate buffer (21 mM NaH 2PO 4 and 29 mM Na 2HPO 4). 
The synthetic wastewater medium used for the work described in chapter 5 
comprised of Molasses (2 gL-1) as the electron donor, dissolved in tap water. 
Common auxiliary salts that are routinely present in textile wastewater 
Na2SO 4.10H 2O and NaCl were added (2% W/V, 1:1 ratio) to the synthetic 
wastewater anolyte medium in order to provide the necessary ionic strength for 
MFC operation. The final pH of the anolyte medium feed was 7.6 ± 0.2. AO7 was  
supplemented into the synthetic wastewater from a stock solution. The synthetic 
wastewater was stripped of dissolved oxygen by sparging nitrogen gas for 10 
minutes before being continuously fed into the MFC stage of the two -stage reactor 
system.  
The MFCs used for the study described in chapter 5 were inoculated with the 
same azo dye acclimated mixed microbial population as described earlier from 
already operational MFCs treating simulated azo dye wastewater. The azo dye 
adapted mixed microbial culture was introduced into the MFC units at 10% of the 
total reactor working volume. During start -up, the inoculated MFCs were operated 
in fed -batch mode up -to three consecutive cycles in order to obtain reproducible 
MFC performance from all replicate reactors. The s ame synthetic medium without 
the azo dye was used during the start -up of MFC reactors.  
For the work described in chapter 6, model wastewater containing AO -7 (35 mgL-1) 
was prepared as described below. For the latter part of the study involving real 
indust rial wastewater, the colour industry effluent was modified by supplementing 
it with 2 gL-1 of molasses to act as a co -substrate during colour removal. The real 53 
 wastewater influent for continuous reactor operation was autoclaved at 110°C for 
15 minutes. The  industrial wastewater influents from wool colouring and leather 
tanning indicated COD values of 3950 ± 40 mgL-1 and 4250 ± 30 mgL-1 following 
the supplementation of 2 gL-1 of molasses co -substrate. The MFC stage was 
inoculated with an azo dye adapted mixe d microbial consortium from a 
continuously fed tubular MFC system treating AO -7 as described earlier.  
The minimal growth medium used in the work described in chapter 7 was the 
same as described earlier but was supplemented with glucose (1gL-1) as the 
carbo n source. For the experiments involving various external resistances, dyes 
were introduced into anode medium at a concentration of 50 mgL-1 from a filter 
sterilised stock solution before starting each experiment. For the experiments 
involving synthetic red ox mediators, AQDS and AQS were supplemented into the 
anode growth medium at concentrations 20 µM, 50 µM and 150 µM from filter 
sterilised 10 mM synthetic redox mediator stock solutions. All experiments with 
synthetic redox mediators were carried out using  AO-7 as the model azo 
compound, supplemented into the anode medium at a concentration of 210 mgL-1 
from a filter sterilised stock solution. All experiments were carried out in a 
temperature controlled environment (30 ⁰C) in an incubator.  
The inoculum sourc e for the two -chamber MFC system was the azo dye adapted 
mixed bacterial culture from an already operating fed -batch MFC system treating 
simulated azo dye wastewater as described earlier. The biomass was centrifuged, 
washed twice with sterile phosphate buf fer before being introduced into the anode 
chamber at approximately 90 mg wet biomass per anode volume (150 mL).  
The anolyte medium (apart from the vitamin solutions and redox mediators) and all 
MFC components were sterilised by autoclaving at 121 ⁰C for 15 minutes.  54 
 2.3. Bio-electrochemical systems and operation  
For the study described in chapter 3, the H -type MFCs were constructed with two 
identical Duran glass bottles and were held together with an external metal clip. 
The anode and cathode compartments were separated with a cation exchange 
membrane (CMI -7000, Membranes International - USA). Two rubber gaskets were 
used to ensure a seal. The electrodes were constr ucted from carbon cloth (Figure  
2.2). The cathode contained a Pt catalyst layer with a Pt load ing of 0.5 mgcm-2. Pt 
powder for the cathode was mixed with carbon black powder (Sigma Aldrich, UK) 
for a 10% (w/w) mixture. This mixture was suspended in Nafion ionomer solution 
(Sigma Aldrich) and the suspension was applied as a uniform coating on the 
cathode electrodes using a paint brush. Electrode connections were made by 
soldering insulated Copper wire onto the electrodes using Lead solder. All 
exposed connections were coated with non -conductive epoxy for insulation. Each 
electrode had a projected sur face area of 20  cm2. An e xternal load of 2200  Ω was 
used in all experiments and the potential across the resistor was recorded using 
the Picolog ADC -24 (Pico Technology, UK) online data logging system.  
 55 
  
Figure  2.2: Schematic diagram of the two -chamber MFC s et-up used throughout 
this work .  
 
The catholyte and anolyte solutions were buffered to pH 7.0 using 50mM 
phosphate buffer (21mM - NaH 2PO 4 and 29mM - Na2HPO 4) in all experiments.  
The experiments were carried out in batch mode with a working volume of 150  mL 
in each MFC compartment. During start —up, the anode was seeded with actively 
growing S. oneidensis or anaerobically digested sludge seed culture (10% V/V of 
the total anolyte volume). The anolyte was purged with nitrogen gas for 10 minutes 
through a 0.22  µm pore diameter filter prior to inoculation. The catholyte was 
actively aerated at an air flow rate of 100 mLmin-1 using an aquarium pump. All 
experiments were conducted at 30°C using a Stuart 160 incubator (Fisher 
Scientific, UK).  
For the work described in chapter 4, the same H -type, two -chamber MFC 
configuration described earlier was used. An external resistance of 1kΩ was used 
in all experiments and the potential across the external resistance was recorded  
using a Picolog ADC -24 (Pico -Technology, UK) online data logging system. Prior 
56 
 to inoculation, the anolyte medium was sparged with nitrogen gas for 10 minutes 
and the MFC headspace was also filled with nitrogen gas. The anode was seeded 
with the previousl y described azo dye adapted microbial consortium (10% v/v of 
the anode volume) from a Winogradsky column.The MFCs were operated in fed 
batch mode. Each fed -batch cycle was initiated when the MFC voltage fell below 
50mV and 75% anode contents were removed a nd replenished with fresh dye -
containing medium when starting new cycles. The catholyte was sparged 
continuously with air at a flow rate of 200 mLmin-1. All experiments were 
conducted in a temperature regulated Stuart 160 incubator (Fisher Scientific, UK).  
Cylindrical single chamber MFCs were used in the work presented in chapter 5. 
They were constructed from polyvinyl chloride and had a working volume of 
200mL. The reactor dimensions were 3.5 cm (internal diameter) and 30  cm length. 
Both electrodes were co nstructed from carbon fabric (PRF composite materials, 
Dorset, UK). The concentric anode had a projected surface area of 96cm2 
whereas the cathode had a surface area of 64 cm2 (measured). The cathode 
contained a platinum catalyst layer on one side (Pt load ing at 0.35 mgcm-2) and a 
Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) diffusion layer on the other side in order to 
minimise water loss through the membrane. The cathode catalyst layer was 
applied as described earlier in section 2.1.4. and the PTFE gas diffusion layer was 
applied as descri bed by Antolini et al , 2002. The connections on the electrodes 
were secured using insulated copper wire soldered to the electrodes and the 
connection interfaces were insulated with non -conductive epoxy. The anode and 
the cathode were s eparated by a CMI -7000 cation exchange membrane 
(Membranes International, USA). Electrode spacing between the anode and the 
cathode was approximately 1.3 cm. The external circuit of the MFCs were 
connected across a 1000 Ohm resistor to a data acquisition s ystem (Picolog ADC -57 
 24, Pico Technology, UK) in order to gather voltage data, set at a data recording 
interval of 10 minutes (Figures  2.3 and 2.4). All single -chamber MFCs were 
simultaneously and continuously fed using a multi -channel peristaltic pump 
(Wats on-Marlow, UK) with an up -flow configuration. The outflowing effluent from 
the MFC stage was continuously fed -into the aerobic second stage of the reactor 
installed downstream to the MFC stage. The dye containing influent feeding rate 
was varied throughout  the study.  
The working volume of the subsequent aerobic stage was 1000  mL. The aerobic 
reactor was continuously aerated at an air sparging rate of 200  mL air per minute 
through a ceramic air stone sparger using an aquarium pump and was 
continuously agitated using a magnetic mixer. All constituent stages of the 
integrated reactor system were operated at ambient temperature without 
exogenous control of temperature. The temperature in the laboratory varied from 
14.6⁰C (during winter) and 26 ⁰C (during su mmer).

For the work described in chapter 6, three MFC un its were incorporated to 
produce a modular scale -up model for the initial MFC stage of the two -stage 
system. The system components and the hydraulic flow of the up -scaled system 
are shown in Figure  2.5. The MFCs were arranged in tandem but operated as a 
single unit in terms of hydraulic flow.

The working volume of a single MFC module was 400 mL and had a combined 
working volume of 1200 mL in the integrated reactor system. The MFC reactor 
construction was of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubes and had an internal diameter of 
3.5 cm an d a length of 60 cm. The anode and the cathode were made of carbon 
paper (PRF composite materials, Dorset, UK) and had surface areas of 192 cm2 
(projected) and 128 cm2 (measured) respectively. The electrode spacing between 
the anode and the cathode was approximately 1.3 cm. The hollow concentric 
anode ran through the length of the PVC tube. Platinum powder was used as the 
oxygen reduction catalyst in the cathode and was  coated on to the cathode 
membrane -facing side at 0.35 mgcm-2. The air facing side of the cathode 
contained a PTFE diffusion layer in order to minimise water loss through the cation 
exchange membrane. The Pt catalyst layer and the PTFE diffusion layer was 
applied as described earlie. Electrical connections on the electrodes were secured 
61 
 by soldering copper wire onto the electrodes and the exposed junctions were 
sealed with non -conductive epoxy. A cation exchange membrane (CMI -7000 – 
Membranes International,  USA) separated the anode and the cathode in all three 
MFC modules. The spacing between the anode and the cathode was 
approximately 1.5 cm in each MFC module. Three MFC modules were connected 
in parallel to a 500 Ohm external resistor and the voltage acros s the resistance 
was monitored using a Picolog ADC -24 (Pico Technology, UK) data logging 
system at a data recording interval of 10 minutes. The external electrical circuit in 
the system is indicated in Figure  2.6. Real or model dye wastewater was 
continuou sly fed with an up -flow configuration to the MFC modules using a 
peristaltic pump. The effluent from the MFC stage was collectively fed into the 
second aerobic stage of the integr ated bioreactor system (Figures  2.7 and 2.9). 
The aerobic bioreactor stage wa s actively aerated continuously through an 
airstone sparger at an air flow rate of 400 mL air per minute. The aerobic reactor 
was continuously agitated using a magnetic mixer. The working volume of the 
aerobic stage was 2  L. The HRTs of the MFC stage and t he subsequent aerobic 
stage respectively were 13.3 hours and 22.2 hours.

The work presented in chapter 7 used the same conventional H -type MFC system 
described earlier. The anode and cathode chambers were operated with a working 
volume of 1 50 mL and the measured surface area of the electrodes was 20 cm2. 
The cathode contained a platinum catalyst layer with a Pt loading of 0.5 mgcm-2. 
The cathode catalyst layer was applied as described earlier. The anode and 
cathode chambers were separated by  a cation exchange membrane (CMI 7000 – 
Membranes International, USA). For start -up of the system, the MFCs were 
64 
 allowed to produce a stable voltage across a 1  kΩ resistor for three consecutive 
fed-batch cycles in dye -free media before being used in experi ments.  
2.4. Experimental design  
In the first study described in chapter 3, investigated the kinetics of AO7 
decolourisation by S.oneidensis  in MFC anodes at AO7 concentrations ranging 
from 35 mgL-1 to 350 mgL-1 using dual chamber MFCs assembled and operated 
as described earlier. The effect of inoculum type on AO7 decolourisation (at an 
AO7 concentration of 35 mgL-1) was studied using S.oneidensis , anaerobic 
digested sludge and a mixed inoculum of anaerobic sludg e and S.oneidensis  at a 
volumetric ratio of 1:1 (the total inoculum was 10% V/V of the working volume of 
the anode). The control was an MFC containing AO7 (35 mgL-1) with no 
microorganism. The effect of pH on AO -7 decolourisation by S.oneidensis  was 
invest igated by changing the anolyte medium pH from pH -4 to pH -9 using 2N HCl 
or NaOH to adjust the anolyte pH. Starting AO -7 concentration was kept constant 
at 35 mgL-1 throughout the set of experiments investigating the effect of pH on AO -
7 decolourisation. Th e anolyte medium composition was the same as in other 
parts of this study (co -substrate – Sodium pyruvate at 20 mM concentration). The 
effect of co -substrate type on AO7 decolourisation kinetics was determined at AO7 
concentrations of 35 mgL-1 and 195 mgL-1 in MFCs inoculated with S. oneidensis . 
The co -substrates chosen were sodium acetate, rapeseed cake, molasses and 
corn-steep liquor (Sigma Aldrich, UK) and were supplemented in the anolyte 
medium at a concentration of 300 mgL-1. The abiotic control experiments used in 
this work were not seeded with the microbial inoculum but used the same medium 
as the other experiments and were assembled and operated under the same 
conditions as the tests. The colour removal by adsorption in abi otic controls is 
presented in appendix 1.  65 
 The work described in chapter 4 was conducted in several separate experiments 
as indicated below.  
Experiment 1: Long -term fed -batch operation of the MFC system containing the 
simulated wastewater was conducted at 30°C for 50 days. Microbial community 
analysis was carried out on samples collected at the end of the fed -batch 
operation (after 50 days) and un -adapted anaerobically digested sludge.  
Experiment 2: The effect of operating temperature on decolourisation of  azo dye 
mixtures was investigated at 20˚C, 30˚C, 40˚C and 50˚C respectively.  
Experiment 3: The effect of salt concentration in the anode feed on 
decolourisation of the dye mixture was investigated using anolyte feed solutions 
containing salt contents ran ging from 0% - 2.5% (w/v). Salts used were NaCl and 
Na2SO 4.10H 2O in a ratio of 1:1  (temperature controlled at 30˚C at all salt 
concentrations).  
The abiotic controls used in the experiments described in chapter 4 contained the 
same molasses medium and the azo dye mixture but were not seeded with the 
azo dye adapted microbial consortium. All abiotic control MFCs containing media 
and the dye mixture (360 mgL-1) were autoclaved at 121°C for 15 minutes and 
were used without inoculation. All experiments were con ducted in duplicate and 
the values reported are means ± SD of the mean.  
The assessment of azo dye adsorption: A separate test was carried out in order to 
assess the colour removal contribution from dye adsorption on to biomass and 
other surfaces in the MFC  (eg. electrodes and membrane). Microbial cultures in 
MFCs that showed a stable voltage output after start -up (after 72 hours) were heat 
killed by autoclaving (121°C for 15 minutes). The azo dye mixture (sterilised at 
121°C for 15minutes) was introduced in to the heat inactivated MFCs at the same 66 
 concentration (360 mgL-1) and colour removal was assessed after 24 hours of 
incubation at 30°C.  
In the work  described in chapter 5, the MFC stage of the experimental set -up 
consisted of three identical MFC units operating in continuous flow mode, two of 
which were duplicate tests and the other was an open -circuit control. The azo dye 
loading rate was incrementa lly varied from 70 g m-3day-1 to 210 g m-3day-1 during 
the experiments. The hydraulic residence time (HRT) of the influent within the 
MFC stage of the integrated reactor system was 12 hours during all dye loading 
rates. Samples were drawn from all reactors  at set time points throughout the 
experimental run (total length - 154 days). Sampling was conducted from the 
influent (i.e. feeding tank), the MFC reactors and the aerobic stage bioreactors. 
The HRT of the subsequent aerobic reactor stage was 60 hours. Th e values 
reported are means of duplicate experiments. The components of the integrated 
two stage MFC -aerobic reactor system treating AO -7 containing synthetic 
wastewater and its hydraulic flow is depicted i n the schematic diagram (Figure  2.6). 
Following th e two -stage continuous runs, the ability of the MFC stage of the 
system to recover from a sudden shock -load of AO -7 was investigated. AO -7 was 
spiked into the MFC reactor stage from a 5 gL-1 AO-7 stock solution to reach a 
final AO -7 concentration of 400 mg L-1 in the MFC stage. The recovery of the MFC 
stage was tracked in terms of colour and COD removal.  
In the work described in chapter 6, experiments were designed and carried out 
with the aim of investigating the effect of scale -up of the integrated MFC -aerobic 
two-stage bioreactor system for azo dye removal and to investigate the reactor 
performance when used for the treatment of model and real industrial wastewaters. 
A modular scale -up was used in which the MFC stage comprised of three 400 mL 
MFC units act ed in unison to act as the initial stage of the two -stage system.  67 
 During the initial experiment where model wastewater containing AO -7 was used, 
the AO -7 loading rate was maintained at 126 gm-3day-1 (COD loading of 5.76 kg 
CODm-3day-1). In the experiment where real colour industry wastewater was used, 
COD loadings of 7.11 kgCODm-3day-1 (dye wastewater from wool colouring) and 
7.65 kgCODm-3day-1 (dye wastewater from leather tanning) respectively were 
maintained. Colour and COD removal performance of the rea ctor system during 
the experimental runs were monitored.  
In the work described in chapter 7, separate experiments were carried out several 
at different applied external resistances 10 Ω, 510 Ω, 2.2 kΩ, 10 kΩ and 46 kΩ for 
each model azo dye. An open circu it control was run in parallel with all 
experiments for comparison purposes. All experiments were carried out in 
duplicate and the data presented are means ± SD of duplicate tests. For the 
experiments involving synthetic redox mediators, the concentration of the two 
mediators tested (AQDS and AQS) were varied from 20 µM to 150 µM. The control 
experiment included all other components in the anolyte solution except for the 
synthetic redox mediator.  
 2.5. Analytical procedure  
2.5.1. AO7 decolourisation and ki netic study  
The decolourisation of AO7 in MFC anodes in work described in chapter 3, 5 and 
7 were assessed using a UV -Visible spectrophotometer (Perkin -Elmer; Lambda -
35).  AO7 removal was quantified using spectrophotometric standard calibrations 
constructed at the peak absorbance (λ max) of the dye (484nm). The AO7 removal 
efficiency (RE) was calculated as follows:  
  ( )              
                -------------------  1 68 
 Where, C 0AO7 and C tAO7 are AO7 concentrations (mM) at the start and at each time 
point respectively.  
The kinetics of AO7 decolourisation was modelled using first order kinetic models. 
The first order rate constants ( k) for AO7 decolourisation reactions can be 
estimated using the integrated first order rate law.  
  [  ] ( )      [  ] ---------------------  2 
Where, C 0 and C t respectively are AO7 concentrations of the starting sample and 
at each time point. Therefore, -k for the decolourisation of AO7 at each 
concentration would be equal to the slope of a linear plot of ln[C t/C0] against time 
(t). 
2.5.2. Assessment of decolourisation of the azo dye mix containing 
simulated wastewater  
The decolourisation of the azo dye mix containing feed solution used in the work 
described in chapter 4 was monitored spectrophotometrically using a Perkin -Elmer 
Lambda -35 UV -visible spectrophotometer. The peak area between wavelengths 
400nm -650nm was used  to monitor colour removal as described by Nigam et al, 
2000; as compliance of different wavelengths within this range is required by 
environmental agencies dealing with such effluents. The decolourisation efficiency 
(DE) of the dye mixture was calculated as follows:  
   ( )      
         --------------------- 3 
Where, A 0 and A t are absorbance peak area values between the wavelength 
range 400  nm - 650 nm of UV -Visible spectra scans in the starting solution and at 
each time point respectively. Kinetics of dye decolourisation during MFC fed -batch 
operation was modelled using first order kinetic models. The first order kinetic 69 
 constants of decolourisation (K (decol)) can be estimated using the integrated first -
order rate law.  
ln (A t) = - K (decol) * t + ln (A 0)  ---------------------  4 
Where, A 0 and A t are absorbance peak area values between the wavelength 
range 400  nm - 650 nm of UV -Visible spectra scans in the starting solution and at 
each time point respectively.  
In order to assess the colour removal in more complex real industrial wastewater 
used in work described in chapter 7, UV – visible scans of real wastewater and the 
decolourised samples were used  (Perkin – Elmer Lambda -35 UV -Visible 
spectrophotometer). The colour removal efficiencies were established by 
calculating the peak area reduction within the wavelength region 400  nm – 650 nm 
of the UV -vis scans of influent and effluent wastewater samples, as described 
earlier in equation 3.  
Colour removal in the MFC anodes used in the work described in chapter 7 was 
assessed using a UV -visible spectrophotometer (Lambda -35, Perkin Elmer). Azo 
dye degradation was modelled into first order kinetics. The first -order 
decolourisation kinetic constants ( k) were  estimated as described earlier in 
equation 2.  
2.5.3. COD removal  
Chemical oxygen demand (COD) of the samples was determined using the closed 
reflux titrimetric method as described in Environment Agency (UK)  Standard 
method 5220D (Westwood , 2007). Appropriately diluted 2 mL samples were used 
for each determination. Briefly, the samples were centrifuged at 6000 g for 10 
minutes and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.22 µm PTFE filter in order to 
remove suspended biomass. Appropriately diluted 2 mL samples were added to 70 
 3.8 mL of Ficodox mixed COD reagent and was digested on a pre -heated heating 
block for 1.5 hours at 150°C in closed digestion tubes. A 0.025M ferrous 
ammonium sulphate (FAS) titrant was used with 2 -3 drops of Ferroin indi cator 
solution (Fisher Scientific, UK) in order to titrimetrically determine the residual 
Potassium dichromate contained in the Ficodox digestate following the digestion 
with the sample. The COD removal was calculated using the following equation:  
COD (mgL-1) = (V b – Vs)  *  DF  * M * 4000  ------------------  5 
Where V b and V s are ferrous ammonium sulphate (FAS) titrant volumes for the 
blank and the sample respectively, DF is the sample dilution factor and M is the 
molarity of FAS titrant.  
The percentage COD removal was calculated as follows:  
                                
           ---------------  6 
Where, COD i and COD s are initial COD and sample COD value at each time point 
respectively.  
The COD removal kinetic constants ( K (CODrem) ) in the work described in chapter 4 
were determined as follows:  
ln (COD s) = - k (CODrem)  * t + ln (COD i)  -----------------  7 
Where, COD i and COD s respectively are initial and sample COD concentration 
values at each time point.  
The -k (CODrem) is equal to the slope of linear plot of ln(COD s/COD i) against time (t).  
2.5.4. Extraction of AO -7 degradation products  
In the work described in chapter 5, the final effluent samples collected at the end 
of the aerobic second stage were centrifuged at 8000 g for 10 minutes and filtered 71 
 through PTFE membrane filters (0.22  µm) in order to remove suspended biomass. 
The superna tant was then acidified to pH -2 using 3N HCl in order to precipitate 
soluble proteins. The solution was then centrifuged at 8000 g for 10 minutes and 
the supernatant was used for metabolite extraction. The metabolites in these 
samples were extracted into e qual volumes of ethyl acetate. The extracts were 
concentrated by rotary evaporation and dried over anhydrous Na 2SO 4 in a 
desiccator to obtain crystals. These crystals were then dissolved in 1 mL of HPLC 
grade methanol.   
2.5.5. Detection of degradation pro ducts using HPLC  
For the work presented in chapter 3, the degradation products of AO7 
decolourisation were identified using HPLC according to the procedure described 
by Mu et al , 2009. The HPLC system (DIONEX GS50) was equipped with a 
Phenomenex Gemini C18  reversed phase column (5  µm, 150 X 4.6  mm) and a 
Photodiode Array (PDA) detector (DIONEX PDA -100). The two standard 
compounds sulfanilic acid and 1 -amino -2-naphthol were detected at wavelengths 
248 nm and 284  nm respectively. The mobile phase consisted of  50% methanol 
and 50% 33  mM (pH 7) phosphate buffer. The mobile phase was pumped at a flow 
rate of 1 mLmin-1 and the sample injection volume was 20 µL. The presence of the 
two AO7 decolourisation metabolites Sulfanilic acid and 1 -amino -2-naphthol were 
confirmed using the retention times (R t) of the standard compounds.  
2.5.6. Identification of degradation metabol ites using HPLC -MS 
In the work described in chapter 5, the separation of AO7 degradation metabolites 
was carried out using HPLC (Dionex GS50). The HPLC system was equipped with 
a Phenomenex Gemini® reversed phase C18 column (5  µm, 150 X 4.6  mm). The 
detection of the metabolites was done at 248 nm using a photodiode array 
detector (Dionex PDA -100). The mobile phases were 0.05% (V/V) formic acid in 72 
 Acetonitrile (mobile phase -A) and HPLC grade water (mobile phase -B). 
Subsequent to a 1 minute equ ilibration before injection, a linear gradient of 10% - 
90% of mobile phase -A (0.05% formic acid in Acetonitrile) was used over 29 
minutes. The sample injection volume was 20 µL and a flow rate of 1 mLmin-1 was 
used.  
The HPLC system was interfaced with Su rveyor® MSQ plus Z -spray electrospray 
ionisation (ESI) mass spectrometer. The mass spectrometer was operated in the 
positive mode with a cone voltage of 70 V and the probe temperature was 400°C. 
The needle voltage was maintained at 3 kV and the capillary t emperature was set 
to 200°C. Nitrogen was used as the cone gas. The mass range selected was from 
45 – 500 amu. Quasi -molecular ions formed in ESI -MS were identified using the 
NIST mass spectra database.  
2.5.7. Quantification of 4 -aminobenzenesulfonic acid and 1 -amino -2-
naphthol  
Quantification of the two reductive degradation products of AO -7 4 -
aminobenzenesulfonic acid and 1 -amino -2-naphthol (produced at the end of the 
MFC stage) in the work described in chapter 5 was carried out using HPLC. The 
authentic s tandards of both compounds (analytical grade) were purchased from 
Sigma Aldrich (UK). Samples from both MFC stage and the aerobic stage were 
analysed using a reversed phase Phenomenex Gemini® C18 column. The mobile 
phases were acetonitrile and HPLC grade w ater (60:40 V/ V) pumped at a flow rate 
of 1 mL min-1. The sample injection volume was 20 µL and the detection of both 
compounds was conducted at 248 nm. For identification of 4 -
aminobenzenesulfonic acid and 1 -amino -2-naphthol in samples, the retention 
times  (Rt) of the standard compounds were compared to those of samples. 
Standard curves for both compounds were constructed and the concentrations of 73 
 both compounds present in all samples were directly read from the standard 
curves.  
HPLC gradient elution of the metabolites contained in the samples was carried out 
for the work described in chapter 6, in order to investigate the chemical changes 
that took place during the two -stage decolourisation process. The separation of 
metabolites using HPLC gradient elution was carried as described earlier. Briefly, 
the Dionex GS50 HPLC system was equipped with a Phenomenex Gemini® 
reversed phase C18 column (5  µm, 150 X 4.6  mm). The detection of the 
metabolites was done at 248  nm using a photodiode  array detector (Dionex PDA -
100). The mobile phases were Acetonitrile (mobile phase -A) and HPLC grade 
water (mobile phase -B). Subsequent to a 1minute equilibration before injection, a 
linear gradient of 10% - 90% of mobile phase -A (Acetonitrile) was used o ver 29 
minutes. The sample injection volume was 20  µL and a flow rate of 1 mLmin-1 was 
used.  
2.5.8. Fourier Transform Infra -Red (FTIR) analysis  
FTIR spectroscopy was carried out in order to further understand the chemical 
nature of the substituent groups present in the fully decolourised samples 
originating from the aerobic stage of the integrated reactor system. Ethyl acetate 
extracts obtained from the aerobic bioreactor stage of the reactor and the AO -7 
containing influent were obtained using the procedu re described in the section 2.7. 
The dry crystals obtained were finely ground to powder form and were mixed with 
spectroscopically pure KBr (5:95 ratio) (BDH chemicals, UK) and pressed into 
translucent pellets using a laboratory press. The KBr pellets were  fixed in the 
sample holder and FTIR scans were conducted at the mid IR region ranging from 
400 cm-1 to 4000  cm-1 at 16 scan speed (Perkin Elmer, Spectrum One) (Eastman 
Dental Institute, University College, London).  74 
 2.5.9 . Toxicity assessment  
Vibrio fische ri (NCIMB strain 13938) was initially grown in NCIMB growth medium 
1537 (Oceanibulbus medium) (Table  2.7).

V.fischeri  was grown in Oceanibulbus medium for 72 hours (22°C, 150 rpm) before 
the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 X g. The cell pellet was washed 
twice with sterile phosphate buffer (50  mM, pH 7.1) and was resuspended in a 
sterile 2% NaCl solution before being used in the toxicity assay.  
Toxicity assays were conducted according to the Microtox® standard acute tox icity 
testing procedure (Gaudet , 1994). The luminescence inhibition cytotoxi city 
assessment procedure was checked using phenol solutions ranging from 5 mgL-1 
to 45 mgL-1 (Figure 2.9) prior to be used for the determination of toxicity of the 
samples originating from this study. The luminescence inhibition was measured as 
described below.  75 
  
Figure 2.9: Vibrio fischeri  acute cytotoxicity assay dose -response curve using 
phenol (5 mgL-1 – 45 mgL-1).  
 
For the acute toxicity work described in chapter 5, bioluminescence based toxicity 
assessment of samples was carried out using the standard Microtox® V.fischeri  
luminescence reduction assay as described earlier. The half maximal inhibitory 
concentrations (IC 50) (indicating a red uction of half of the total luminescent 
intensity compared to controls) were expressed as a COD equivalent of the 
analysed samples. All samples for toxicity testing were obtained when the reactor 
system was operating at its highest AO -7 loading rate (210 g m-3day-1).  
2.5.10. Mutagenicity assessment using Ames test  
Mutagenicity of the reductive decolourisation products generated following full 
colour removal in MFCs in experiments that contained AO -7 concentrations 
ranging from 35 mgL-1 to 350 mgL-1 was established using soft overlay agar Ames 
mutagenicity testing procedur e as described by Maron and Ames , 1983. The two 
histidine auxotroph strains S.typhimurium  TA 1535 and TA 1538 carry the 
following two mutations respectively in their histidine synth esis genes hisG 
(hisG46  – a base -pair mutation) and hisD (hisD3052  – a frame -shift mutation) 
(Maron and Ames , 1983). The two strains tested are unable to synthesise histidine 
76 
 on their own and therefore, are unable to grow on histidine deficient growth medi a. 
The mutagenic potential of a tested chemical or physical mutagen is proportional 
to the rate of reversion of the tested strains from histidine auxotroph to a histi dine 
prototroph (Maron and Ames , 1983). Where the reverted strain acquires the 
capability of synthesise histidine and grow on histidine deficient growth medium 
following exposure to a mutagen.  
The mutagenicity tests were carried out on Vogel -Bonner minimal agar plates with 
a soft -top agar layer seeded with the test organism and the test chemic als. The 
composition of the Vogel -Bonner minimal medium -E (VBE) (50X concentrated) is 
shown in T able 2.8 (Pilatz et al , 2006).

 All components were autoclaved at 121°C for 15 minutes except the glucose stock 
solution and the trace stock solution for soft top agar overlays. Glucose stock was 
autoclaved at 110°C for 10 minutes and the trace stock solution was filter sterilised 
throug h a sterile 0.22 µm pore diameter PTFE filter.  
Test culture strains S.typhimurium  strains TA 1535 and TA 1538 were grown in LB 
media overnight and the overnight cultures were used for Ames mutagenicity 
testing.  
VBE glucose agar (15 mL) was first poured in to petri dishes and allowed to set. 
The test organism (100 µL) and the test chemical (i.e. AO -7 degradation products 
or the unreduced dye) (100 µL) were added to 2 mL of molten soft -top agar and 
poured over the first layer of agar. When the top layer was set, the plates were 
incubated at 37°C for 72 hours. The revertant colonies developed on the soft agar 
overlay were counted using a semi -automatic bacterial colony counter (American 
Optical Quebec 3327). All test s were carried out in duplicate with sodium azide 
being used as a positive control (Figure  2.10) and sterilised deionised water being 
used for the background plate. The average background colony count was 
subtracted from all tests.

2.5.11. Electrochemical monitoring  
Polarization curves for determining power density vs current density plots were 
constructed using a range of external resistances spanning 1Ω - 1MΩ. The 
external circuit of the MFC was opened to connect various external resistances 
when the system exhibited a stable voltage across the initial 2200Ω external 
resistor. The current flowing through each external load was calculated using the 
Ohm’s law.  
I = E/R   -------------  8 
Where, I is the current flowing through the load (mA), E is the potential across the 
resistor (mV) and R is the external resistance (Ω).  
The power produced was calculated using the following equation:  
P = E I  ---------------  9 80 
 Where, P is Power produced (mW), E is the potential (mV) and I is the current 
(mA).  
The current density and power density values were calculated by normalising 
current and power values to the projected surface area of the anode (20  cm2).  
Coulombic efficiency (CE) was calculated by integrating the measured current 
over time based on the observed COD removal as follows (Logan et al , 2006):  
   ( )  ∫    
 
                  ---------------  10 
Where, M is the molecular weight of Oxygen (32), I is current (A), F is the 
Faraday’s constant (96485 Cmol-1), b is the number of electrons exchanged per 
mol of oxygen (4), V an is the working volume of the anode (L) and ΔCOD is the 
change of COD over time (t) (g CODL-1). 
In the work described in chapter 5, the test MFC units were operated in closed 
circuit configuration with 500  Ω external resistances whereas the control MFC 
reactor was operated in open circuit configuration. Voltage data acquisition from all 
reactors was conducted using a Picolog (Pico Technology, UK) data logging 
system. The current flowing through the external circuit was calculated using the 
Ohm’s law as prev iously described in equation 8 . The Power produced by the 
MFC systems was calculated as pr eviously described in equation 9 . The current 
and power values obtained were normalised to the anode surface area (96  cm2) to 
construct polarisation curves and power -current plots. External circuits were 
opened at the end of the MFC operation in order to connect various external 
resistances ranging from 1  Ω to 1  MΩ. When the potential differences across each 
resistance reached a stable value, they were used to construc t polarisation curves 
and power -current plots.  81 
 The external circuits of the three integrated MFC modules were connected in 
parallel configuration to a 500 Ohm load as shown in figure  2.6. The ADC -24 
(Pico -Technology, UK) data logging system was connected in parallel across the 
500 Ohm resistance. Polarisation curves of the collective three -module system 
were recorded by varying the external resistance from 1 Ohm to 1 Mega Ohm and 
recording the registered voltage across each external load. Current flowing across 
each resistance was calculated using the O hm’s law, as shown in equation 8. The 
power produced was calculated as earlier d escribed according to equation 9. 
Current and power val ues were normalised to the anode surface area (192 cm2) 
and were used to construct power -current plots.  
For the work described in chapter 7, the total internal resistance (R int) of the MFC 
systems were estimated using the polarisation slope method as descr ibed by 
Menicucci et al, 2006 and Fan et al , 2008. During each experiment, the external 
circuit of the MFCs were opened to connect various external resistances ranging 
from 1  Ω – 1 MΩ.  When the potential across each resistance indicated a stable 
voltage v alue, it was used to construct polarisation curves and power -current plots 
as described earlier. The maximum power density (P max) of the MFC systems was 
obtained from power -current curves. The slope of the Ohmic polarisation region 
represents the total int ernal resistance (R int) (Menicucci et al, 2006, Liang et al, 
2007 and Fan et al , 2008).  
Cyclic voltammetry of the experiments involving synthetic redox mediators was 
carried out using a PG 581 potentiostat (UniScan Instruments, UK). MFC anodes 
were used a s the working electrode whereas the cathode was used as the counter 
electrode. Ag/AgCl electrode (4M KCl, BASi reference electrodes, USA) was used 
as the reference electrode. A scan rate of 10 mVsec-1 was used and the potential 
sweeps were carried out with in the potential range of ( -) 500 mV to 500 mV.  82 
 2.5.12. Microbial community analysis  
For the work described in chapter 4, microbial community analysis was carried out 
by amplification and analysis of the V3 region of the 16s ribosomal DNA  (rDNA) of 
bacteria (Figure  2.11) using PCR and DGGE . Total genomic DNA was extracted 
using the phenol -chloroform method (Ogram et al , 1987) from the original 
anaerobic digested sludge and the bulk culture liquid from an MFC fed with 
simulated wastewater c ontaining the azo dye mixture operated in fed -batch mode 
for 50 days. Extracted total microbial genomic DNA was verified on 1% (w/v) 
agarose gels prior to PCR amplification. The DNA extracts were checked for purity 
using the A 260/A280 ratio and quantified using a Nano -Drop (Nano -1000, Thermo 
Scientific, USA) spectrophotometer. The 16s rDNA hypervariable V3 regions were 
then amplified using the following set of universal primers; F357 -GC ( E.coli  
numbering) (5' -CGC CCG CCG CGC GCG GCG GGC GGG GCG GGG GCA 
CGG GGG GCC TAC GGG AGG CAG CAG -3') and R518 ( E.coli  numbering) (5' -
ATT ACC GCG GCT GCT GG -3') (Sun et al , 2012).

The PCR was performe d using Bio -Rad PCR system MJ -Mini (UK) under following 
conditions: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 4 min, followed by 30 cycles of 95 °C for 
0.5 min, 58 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 0.5 min, and finally at 72°C for 7 min. PCR 
products were run on 1.5% (w/v) agarose gels for product size confirmation prior 
to DGGE runs.  
DGGE was performed using CBS Scientific DASG -250 universal mutation 
detection system. PCR products were loaded and run on 8% (w/v) polyacrylamide 
gels (37.5:1 acrylamide:bis -acrylamide) with a denaturant gradient ranging from 30% 
- 60% across the gel (100% corresponding to 7M urea and 40% deionised 
formamide).  
The components of the denaturing ge l are listed in Table  2.12.

The solutions were cast within the glass plates using a gradient delivery system 
and the samples were loaded with a tracker dye (6X – Promega, USA) inside the 
wells.  
Electrophoresis was conducted in 1X Tris -Acetate EDTA (TAE) buffer at 200  V for 
5 hours at 60˚C. Following electrophoresis, the gel was stained using SYBR 
Green -1 DNA stain (Sigma Aldrich, UK) and visualised using a transilluminator 
table. Bands of interest were excised out of the gel using sterile scalpels and 
incubated at 4˚C in tubes containing 100  µL of sterile nuclease -free water for 48 
hours. This solution was used as the template for the second round of PCR 
amplification using the universal primer set F338 (5' -ACT CCT ACG GGA GGC 
AGC AG -3') and R518 using the same PCR conditions indicated before. The 
amplified products were loaded in 40 µL volumes onto 1.5% agarose gels for 
verification. The bands were excised f rom agarose gels and PCR products were 85 
 purified using a QiaQuick gel extraction system (QiaGen, UK). Following the 
verification of PCR products on 1.5% agarose gels, the PCR amplicons were 
sequenced at the Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, Univers ity College 
London, UK.  
The sequences obtained were compared with those in the NCBI GenBank 16s 
rDNA nucleotide sequence repository using NCBI BLAST nucleotide search tool 
(http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ Blast ). Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences was 
conducted using Mega -5.05 molecular evolutionary genetics analysis tool with 
neighbour joining method (with 1000 bootstrap replicates).  
For the work described in chapter 7, changes in microbial communities  during the 
experiments involving different external resistances were investigated using PCR -
DDGE. The total genomic DNA from the samples obtained from MFCs operated 
under various R ext was extracted using a Sigma Aldrich Gen -Elute bacterial DNA 
kit as per manufacturer’s instructions. The whole genomic DNA isolates were 
verified on 1% (w/v) agarose gels prior to PCR amplifications. The hypervariable 
V3 region of the bacterial 16s rRNA gene was amplified using the following set of 
primers – F357 -GC (5' -CGC CC G CCG CGC GCG GCG GGC GGG GCG GGG 
GCA CGG GGG GCC TAC GGG AGG CAG CAG -3') and R518 (5' -ATT AC C 
GCG GCT GCT GG -3') (Sun et al , 2013). The PCR conditions were the same as 
described earlier. The amplified sections were verified on 1.5% (w/v) agarose gels 
for correct product size confirmation prior to DGGE microbial community profiling.  
Microbial community profiling was carried out using Bio -Rad D -Code universal 
mutation detection system  (USA) . Poly acrylamide gels (8%) with a denaturing 
gradient ranging from 30% to 60% (100% corresponding to 7M urea and 40% 
deionised formamide) were formulated from components as shown in table - 2.12 
and were cast into the glass plates using the Bio -Rad model -475 gradient delivery 86 
 system. The samples were loaded into the wells in with a tracker dye (6X 
concentrated, Promega, USA) and run for 16 hours at 70 Volts. The temperature 
of the system was maintained at 60°C throughout the run. Following the DGGE 
run, the gels were stained using the DNA stain SYBR Green -1 (Sigma Aldrich - UK) 
and was visualised under polarised light using a transilluminator table.   
The gel images were scanned and analysed using the gel image analysis software 
PhyElph© version 1.6. DGGE fingerprints were analysed for their differences in 
the band patterns u sing unweighted pair -group method with arithmetic mean 
(UPGMA) clustering method. UPGMA algorithm with Jaccard’s coefficient was 
used to cluster the band distances on gel images. Dendrograms were created 
using UPGMA clustering algorithm (PhyElph© version 1 .6). 
Bands of interest were excised out of the DGGE gel using sterile scalpels and the 
cut-out gel blocks were incubated at 4°C for 24 hours in tubes containing 100 µL of 
nuclease free water. This was used as the template for second round of PCR 
amplificat ion using the primer set F -338 (5’ -ACT CCT ACG GGA GGC  AGC AG -3’) 
and R518 (Sun et al , 2012). The products were verified for products size on 1.5% 
(w/v) agarose gels and checked for concentration and purity using a Nano -Drop 
spectrophotometer (ND 1000, The rmo Scientific, USA). The DNA samples were 
sequenced at GATC Biotech, Germany.  
The obtained 16s rDNA fingerprints were analysed using the NCBI GenBank 16s 
rDNA gene fingerprint repository ( http://blast.nc bi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast ) using the 
basic local alignment search tool (BLAST). Phylogenetic relationships of the 16s 
rDNA gene fingerprints were established using Mega 5.05 evolutionary genetics 
analysis tool with neighbour joining method (1000 bootstrap replicates were used).  87

Summary  
The decolourisation of acid orange 7 (AO7) (C.I.15510) through co -metabolism in 
a microbial fuel cell by Shewanella oneidensis  strain 14063 was investigated with 
respect to the kinetics of decolourisation, extent of degradation and toxicity of 
biotransform ation products.  The aim of this work was to investigate the 
decolourisation of AO7 in the anode of a MFC through co -metabolism. Of 
particular interest were the kinetics of decolourisation, extent of degradation and 
the toxicity of biotransformation product s. 
Rapid decolourisation of AO7 (> 98% within 30 hours) was achieved at all tested 
dye concentrations with concomitant power production. The aminobenzene 
degradation products were recalcitrant under tested conditions. The first order 
kinetic constant of de colourisation ( k) decreased from 0.709 ± 0.05 h-1 to 0.05 ± 
0.01h-1 (co-substrate - pyruvate) when the dye con centration was raised from 35 
mgL-1 to 350 mgL-1. The use of unrefined co -substrates such as rapeseed cake, 
corn-steep liquor and molasses also indicated comparable or better AO7 
decolourisation kinetic constant values. The fully decolourised solutions indicated 
increased toxicity as the initial AO7 con centration was increased.  
This work highlights the possibility of using microbial fuel cells to achieve high 
kinetic rates of AO7 decolourisation through co -metabolism with concomitant 
electricity production and could potentially be utilised as the initia l step of a two 
stage anaerobic/aerobic process for azo dye biotreatment.

 3.2. Results and discussion  
3.2.1. Anodic decolourisation of AO7 and kinetics of AO7 
removal  
AO7 was rapidly decolourised in MFC anodes at low to moderate concentrations 
(the respective removal r ates at AO7 concentrations 35  mgL-1 and 70  mgL-1 were 
254.6 mgL-1day-1 and 500.4  mgL-1day-1). The rapid colour removal observed is 
associated with the reduction of the AO 7 chromophore at 484  nm (Figure 3.1 A). 
 
Figure 3.1: (A) Absorption spectra showing t he reduction of peak intensity of the 
chromophore at 484  nm over a 10 hour period ( starting AO7 conc -70mg L-1) and 
(B). The effect of AO7 concentration on decolourisation rate in MFC anodes  
91 
  
The temporal AO7 removal reached > 90% at all tested dye concentrations after 
30 hours of MFC operation (Figure 3.1 B). 
AO7 decolourisation kinetics could be fitted to a first order logarithmic decay 
model as described in equation 2 (Figure 3 .2A). The reaction rate constants ( k) for 
the decolourisation reactions decreased with increasing AO7 concentration. A 
linear correlation can be observed between the rate constant ( k) of AO7 
decolourisation and initial AO7 concentration (Figure 3 .2B).  
 
Figure 3.2: (A) The first order logarithmic decay models of AO7 removal in MFC 
anodes and (B) the linear relationship between the first order rate constant ( k) of 
AO7 removal and initial AO7 concentration   
     
This effect may be attributed to the toxicity of the dye or its decolourisation 
metabolites when found in rising concentrations to the anode microbes. IsIk and 
Sponza 2004  and Inan Beydilli and Pavlost athis 2005  reported that accumulation 
of aminobenzene azo dye decolourisation metabolites induces an inhibitory effect 
on decolourisation rates.  
Previously, in studies that utilised mixed anaerobic cultures, Van der Zee et al, 
2001 , Van der Zee et al., 20 00 and Mendez -Paz et al , 2003 suggested that 
92 
 anaerobic decolourisation of AO7 can be fitted to a first -order autocatalytic model 
due to the possible redox mediator role played by 1 -amino -2-naphthol, one of the 
metabolites of AO7 reductive decolourisation. It was suggested that 1 -amino -2-
naphthol in its amino -quinone form may play a role as a redox mediator, catalysing 
the transfer of reducing equivalents to the azo moiety of AO7 molecules, leading to 
its accelerated decolourisation. However, this reported p henomenon was not 
evident at high AO7 concentrations in this study ( k values did not increase as dye 
concentration increased),  most probably due to the inhibitory effect to the anode 
microbial population caused by the toxicity of the dye or the accumulation of its 
decolourisation metabolites. Any possible inhibitory effect on microbial growth or 
metabolism may eventually lead to reduced rates of substrate oxidation and may 
hamper the release of reducing equivalents.  
S. oneidensis  utilised in this study indicated rapid AO7 decolourisation kinetics at 
low to moderate AO7 concentrations. The decolourisation kinetic constants ( k) 
observed in this study are comparable or better in comparison to that of other 
studies utilising pure or mixed microbial cultures (Table 3.1).

The decolourisation of AO7 improved marginally when anaerobic sludge was 
utilised as the inoculum ( k= 0.781 ± 0.021 h-1 at AO7 conc.  35 mgL-1) (Figure 
3.3A). This could be due to the action of biogenic sulphide produced by the 
sulphate reducing microbial communities that are ubiquitously found in anaerobic 
sludge. AO7 decolourisation rates were higher in UASB reactors inoculated with 
anaerobic granular slud ge compared to chemical reduction of AO7 using sulphide 
at comparable concentrations as reported by Van der zee et al, 2001. Hence, the 
presence of biogenic sulphide may be responsible for the marginal increase of 
AO7 decolourisation rate observed in this study when anaerobic sludge was 
utilised to inoculate MFC anodes. However, the electrochemical performance of 
MFCs was markedly lower when anaerob ic sludge was utilised (Figure 3.3 B), 
possibly due to the diversion of electrons to methane generation pathway s by 94 
 methanogenic bacteria usually found in ana erobic sludge (Mendez -Paz et al , 
2005). Supplementing the anaerobic sludge inoculum with S. oneidensis  pure 
culture resulted in restoration of the MFC performance to a limited extent (19 ± 1.6 
mWm-2) while maintaining a high AO7 decolourisation rate ( k= 0.713 ± 0.017 h-1) 
(Figures 3.3A and 3.3 B).

3.2.2. The effect of co -substrate type on decolourisation 
kinetics of AO7  
The use of unrefined co -substrate types such as rapeseed cake, corn -steep liquor 
and molasses indicated high AO7 decolouri sation kinetic constants (table 2). 
Acetate indicated the l owest decolourisation constant (k) value. Identification of 
most suitable and efficient substrate types for biological wastewater treatment is of 
utmost importance in the view of sustainability and cost effectiveness of novel 
wastewater treatment processes . The high kinetic rates of AO7 decolourisation 
utilising unrefined co -substrate types such as rapeseed cake, corn -steep liquor 
95 
 and molasses achieved in this study implies that these relatively cheap raw 
materials could potentially be used in novel textile  wastewater treatment 
processes to effectively decolourise azo d yes using microbial fuel cells.

3.2.3. The effect of pH on AO -7 co-metabolic degradation 
in MFC anodes by S.oneidensis  
The best decolourisation performance was observed when the anolyte medium pH 
was close to the neutral pH value. At pH -7, over 90% AO -7 decolourisation was 
achieved within four hours whereas at low pH (pH -4) and high pH (pH -9), time to 
reach 90% AO -7 decolourisation increased substantially to 56 hours and  29 ho urs 
respectively (Figure  3.4).  96

This suggests that S.oneidensis  is not capable of tolerating extreme high or 
extreme low pH values and its metabolic activity is severely restrained at these 
extremities. The hindrance of microbial metabolic action in turn severely affects 
the electron transfer into the azo moiety of AO -7 and its reductive decolourisation.

 97 
 The variations of pH away from neutral value induced serious adverse effects on 
MFC  powe r output. As depicted on Figure 3.5, when pH shifts away from the 
neutral v alue towards the acidic end (pH 4) and alkaline end (pH 9) both exert a 
negative effect on MFC power densities. This suggests that adverse conditions 
such as high or low pH val ues greatly hinder the external electron transfer activity 
of S.oneidensis . This could be partly due to the reduced bacterial metabolic action 
of bacteria when encountered with adverse conditions such as extreme pH.  
3.2.4. Decolourisation metabolites of AO7 and COD 
removal during MFC operation  
Aminobenzene products of AO7 reductive decolourisation - sulfanilic acid and 1 -
amino -2-naphthol - were detected upon analysis of the decolourised liquid using 
HPLC (Retention times 1.6 min and  4.3 min res pectively) (Figure  3.6). The 
presence of the two compounds after full decolourisation of the anolyte (after ~ 30 
hours) and after 48 hours, suggests that these degradation products are 
recalcitrant under the test conditions.  
 98 
  
Figure 3.6: HPLC profile of fully decolourised effluents from MFC anodes (A) at 30 
hours and (B) at 48 hours indicate the presence of Sulfanilic acid (R t = 1.57  min) 
and 1 -amino -2-naphthol (R t = 4.3min). The two decolourisation metabolites are 
persistent under test c onditions (initial AO7 concentration  before decolourisation – 
195 mg L-1). 
 
Shewanella  species producing flavonoid compounds that are capable of 
enhancing extracellular electron transfer is reported in earl ier studies (von 
Canstein et al , 2008). Therefore, a possible mechanism for the observed rapid 
biotransformation of AO7 into aminobenzene s would be the shuttling of electrons  
produced by microbial substrate oxidation into the azo moiety via microbial 
extracellular redox mediators  such a s flavin compounds . 
The COD removal after 48 hours of MFC operation at the ini tial AO7 concentration 
of 350 mg L-1 was 73.7±1.5% compared to 93.5±0.9% COD removal in the control 
MFC, where no dye was added (Figure 3.7 ). The theoretical oxygen demand 
(ThOD) of AO7 (calculated using stoichiometric oxygen equivalent required for 
complete oxidation) a t a concentration of 1mM (350  mgL-1) is 672  mgL-1. The 
99 
 remaining COD value of the fully decolourised  AO7 s olution (at 350  mgL-1 initial 
dye concentration) after 48 hours was greater than the ThOD (table  3.3).

Figure 3.7: COD removal during MFC operation within a 48 hour period  
 
Hence, the results indicate that the COD removal is primarily associated with the 
microbial oxidation of the primary carbon source (i.e. Pyruvate) rather than the 
utilisation of the dye pollutant as a carbon and energy source. This further 
indicates that the decolourisation metabolites of AO7 are persistent and do not 
easily catabolise under tested conditions.

3.2.6. Assessment of mutagenic potential of the AO7 
decolourisation metabolites using the Ames test.  
It was previously shown that many aminobenzene s resulting from azo dye 
reductive degr adation harbour a significant mutagenic and carcin ogenic potential 
(Chequer et al, 2011 and Ferraz et al , 2011). However, t he toxicity  and 
mutagenicity  profiles of reductively decolourised AO7 solutions has not been 
widely characterised in earlier studies that reported the phenomenon of anaerobic 
decolourisation of AO7.  Therefore, a more complete understanding of the 
mutagenicity of AO7 reductive biotransformation products is required. Furthermore, 
benzidine and 1-phenylazo -2-hydroxynaphthalene  based azo dyes have been 
banned from commercial use in the European Union due to their high mutagenic 
potential (Mansour et al, 2009 and Pandey et al , 2007). They are mainly 
associated with hepatic and bladder cancers as shown in toxicology studies 
involv ing rodents (Pandey et al , 2007). Toxicological and mutagenic potential data 
obtained from animal models such as rodents can be extrapol ated to humans 
(Stiborova et al , 2002). In this study, Ames mutagenicity testing was carried out 
using S.typhimurium  histidine auxotrophs TA1535 and TA1538 on the influent feed 
solution conta ining unreduced AO -7 (at 350 mg L-1) and reductively decolourised

The results of this study suggest that both S.typhimurium  histidine auxotroph 
strains (TA1535 and TA1538) undergo reversion where both strains acq uire the 102 
 capability to grow on Histidine deficient minimal growth medium  when they are 
exposed to AO -7 decolourisation metabolites . The appearance His+ revertants for 
both S.typhimurium  strains indicated a concentration dependant effect where the 
lowest nu mber of His+ revertants was observed at the lowest AO -7 degradation 
metabolite concentration (35 mg L-1) and the highest number of His+ revertants 
observed at the highest AO -7 degradation me tabolite concentration (Figure  3.8). 
Unreduced AO -7 (at 3 50 mg L-1) indicated His+ revertant fold increases of 1.72 and 
2.35 respectively for the two strains TA1535 and TA1538 above  the background 
plate. At 35 mg L-1, His+ revertants fold increases above the background plate for 
TA1535 and TA1538 respectively were 4.27 and 4.35 fold. However, at high AO -7 
concentrations (350 mg L-1 – decolourised), the His+ reversion rate fold increases 
stood significantly higher (p < 0.05, t -test) at 15.18 and 22.28 respectively for 
TA1535 and TA1538 compared to background (control) revertan t plates (F igure  
3.9).  
The two Histidine auxotrophs tested in this study S.typhimurium  TA1535 and 
TA1538 carry a base -pair mutation (point mutation) ( hisG46 ) and a frame -shift 
mutation ( hisD3052 ) respectively in their Histidine synthesis genes and therefo re, 
are unable to grow on Histidine deficient growth media. The high reversion rates 
observed for both S.typhimurium  Histidine auxotroph strains at high AO -7 
decolourisation metabolite concentrations suggests that reductive degradation 
metabolites of AO -7 are capable of inducing both point mutations and frame -shift 
mutations in S.typhimurium . The mutagenic and carcinoge nic potentials of these 
azo dye derivatives have been attributed to their planer aromatic structures, where 
they can intercalate between DNA double helixes with relative ease. Furthermore, 
it is generally accepted that non -polar and planer aromatic structu res are more 
potent mutagens compared to aromatics substituted with polar and charged 103 
 substituent groups (Gottlieb et al , 2003). Sulfanilic acid (4 -aminobenzenesulfonic 
acid) is one of the reductive degradation products of AO -7 and it is a highly 
charged aminobenzene due to the presence of the sulfonic acid group. Therefore, 
it can be expected in the case of AO -7 that high mutagenic potential of AO -7 
reductive degradation metabolites detected by Ames test in this study, is mostly 
due to the relatively non p olar naphthalene derivative 1 -amino -2-naphthol.  
3.2.7. Assessment of electrochemical parameters during 
AO7 decolourisation  
Electrochemical monitoring of the MFCs during AO7 decolourisation indicated a 
statistically significant (P< 0.05) decline of power d ensities obtained from the 
system with increasing AO7 concentrations. The maximum power density reduced 
from 37  mWm-2 to 19.3  mWm-2 when the dye concen tration was increased from 70  
mgL-1 to 350  mgL-1 (Figure  3.10B ). However, the presence of AO7 in the anode 
compartmen t up to a concentration of 70 mg L-1 had no apparent effect on MFC 
electrochemical performance compared to the control MFC with no AO7. This 
suggests that the anodic microbial population may tolerate low to moderate AO7 
pollutant concentrati ons without any detrimental effect on the electr ochemical 
performance (Figures 3.10A and 3.10B ). The notable reduction of power densities 
at high dye concentrations indicate that a significant portion of the electrons 
released during microbial substrate ox idation is diverted to reducing the azo 
chromophore into aminobenzene s. 
 104

maximum power densities, Coulombic efficiencies and percentage COD removal 
at different initial AO7 concentrations. Bars with asterisks indicate that they were 
significantly different (one way ANOVA, P< 0.05 with Tukey post -test).  
 
The presence of alternative electron acceptors in abundance (in this case AO7) for 
the anode bacterial population may greatly diminish the Coulombic efficiency. The 
statistically significant (P< 0.05) reducti on of Coulombic efficiency by almost half 
when the AO7 concen tration was increased from 70  mgL-1 to 350  mgL-1 (Figure  
3.10C ) suggests that the observed drop in electrochemical performance may be 
caused by the competition for electrons by the dye pollutant.  Another contributory 
factor for this effect could be the accumulation of toxic decolourisation metabolites 
of AO7.  
105 
 Li et al, 2010 demonstrated the possibility of employing an MFC system utilising 
an aerobic bio -cathode to achieve more complete mineralisation of the model azo 
dye Congo Red operating in an anaerobic aerobic mode sequential manner. A 
two-step approach utilising a erobic biotreatment, oxidative enzymatic treatment 
such as laccase (Teerapatsakul et al , 2008) or photo -catalysed Fenton reactions 
(Aleboye h et al, 2005 and Chacon et al , 2006) as a second treatment stage could 
hold promise in developing an industrially ap plicable system for treating azo dye 
polluted industrial effluents.  
3.3. Conclu ding remarks  
This study demonstrated the possibility of utilising the electrochemically active 
bacterium S. oneidensis  (strain 14063) to achieve enhanced kinetic rates of AO7 
decolourisation and concomitant production of electrical energy using an MFC 
system. This work further demonstrates that unrefined, cheaper co -substrate types 
such as rapeseed cake, corn -steep liquor and molasses can be successfully 
utilised to achieve high decolourisation kinetics of azo dyes in MFCs. Therefore, 
the enhanced decolourisation kinetic rates  achieved in this study utilising 
unrefined co -substrate types implies that MFCs could potentially be employed as 
the initial step of a two stage anaerobic/ aerobic biological treatment process for 
treating azo dye contaminated industrial effluents.

 Summary  
This study was focused on assessing the suitability of bio -electrochemical systems 
using azo dye adapted mixed cultures for decolourising complex azo dye mixtures 
at industrially relevant conditions. Of particular interest were the influence of 
operating condi tions such as temperature and salinity and the bacterial community 
composition of the azo dye degrading adapted mixed culture.  
In this study, azo dye adapted mixed microbial consortium was used to effectively 
remove colour from azo dye mixtures and to simu ltaneously generate bio -
electricity using microbial fuel cells (MFCs). Operating temperature (20°C -50°C) 
and salinity (0.5% w/v  - 2.5% w/v) were varied during experiments. Reactor 
operation at 50°C improved dye decolourisation and COD removal kinetic 
const ants by approximately two fold compared to the kinetic constants at 30°C. 
Decolourisation and COD removal kinetic constants remained high (0.28  h-1 and 
0.064  h-1 respectively) at moderate salinity (1% w/v) but deteriorated 
approximately four fold when the salinity was raised to 2.5% (w/v). Molecular 
phylogenetic analysis of microbial cultures used in the study indicated that both 
un-acclimated and dye acclimated cultures from MFCs were predominantly 
comprised of Firmicutes  bacteria. This study demonstrates the possibility of using 
adapted microbial consortia in MFCs for achieving efficient bio -decolourisation of 
complex azo dye mixtures and concomitant bio -electricity generation under 
industrially relevant conditions.

 4.2. Results and Discussion  
4.2.1. Decolourisation of azo dye mixtures during fed -
batch MFC operation  
The decolourisation of the feed solution containing the azo dye mixture was 
confirmed by visual observation and spectrophotometric scans, suggesting a rapid 
removal of azo chromophores of the dye mixtu re during MFC operation (Figure 
4.1). The persistent high peak intensities near the UV region (2 20-300 nm) of the 
spectra scans of samples taken at 6, 20 and 36 hours can be attributed to the 
formation of colourless amines during azo dye decolourisation. Under anoxic 
condition, azo dyes are known to undergo reductive decolourisation into their 
respective aminobenzine s by membrane bound non -specific reductase enzymes. 
In view of anionic nature and large molecular size of many azo dyes, it can be 
expected that they are incapable of crossing largely non -polar biological 
membranes into cellular interior.  Hence,  the rapid decolourisation of azo dye 
mixtures observed in this study can be attributed to extra -cellular co -metabolic 
reductive decolourisation by the anodic microbial community. However, it was 
difficult to identify the exact nature of the decolourisatio n metabolites in this study 
due to the complex nature of the dye mixture and the complex carbon source used 
(molasses).  109 
  
Figure 4.1: Absorption spectra  of the feed solution (0 hours – spectrum -A) and 
samples taken at 6, 20 and 36 hours (spectra B, C and D ) respectively indicate the 
decrease in peak intensity at the visible region of the spectrum over -time; 
indicating the decolourisation of the azo dye mixture. Inset: (A) fed -batch feed 
solution, (B), (C) and (D) are samples taken after 6, 20 and 36 hours o f MFC 
operation respectively (temperature - 30°C, Experiment -1). 
 
4.2.2. Decolourisation and COD removal performance 
during MFC fed -batch operation  
Decolourisation of the azo dye mixture and COD reduction in the influent feed 
solution reached over 9 0% in all of the cycles (Figure  4.2). This suggests that 
efficient and repeatable colour removal from azo dye mixtures is possible when 
adapted anaerobic microbial consortia are employed in fed -batch operation. When 
the colour removal by adsorption processes was  assessed, t he decolourisation 
was found to be as low a s 1.6% ± 0.21% (n=3) (appendix 2 ). Therefore, the 
contribution from adsorption to colour removal in this study was considered to be 
small.  In the work presented in the previous chapter, it was  demonstr ated that 
110 
 better decolourisation kinetics compared to other anaerobic systems (eg. UASB 
reactors) could be achieved for the model azo dye Acid Orange -7 (AO -7) in the 
electrochemically activ e environment of MFCs . This was attributed to the more 
effective tr ansfer of reducing equivalents to the azo moiety in an electrochemically 
active environment of a MFC, eventually leading to rapid reductive decolourisation 
of the model azo dye. Sanroman et al , 2004 reported the possibility of 
electrochemical decolourisation of textile azo dye mixtures up -to 2 -3 dyes. 
However, biological decolourisation of azo dye mixtures is rarely reported in 
literature. Previously, Nigam et al, 1996 demonstrated that enrichm ent anaerobic 
mixed cultures were capable of decolourising azo dye mixtures containing up -to 
nine structurally different dyes. In the view of large structural diversity and wide 
range of molecular weights of azo dyes, it can be expected that their 
decolour isation may benefit from the use of adapted anaerobic microbial consortia 
rather than the use of pure cultures.  111

 Harazono and Nakamura , 2005 demonstrated that azo dye mixtures comprising of 
three component dyes can be decolourised using purified fungal manganese 
peroxidase (MnP) and in liquid fermentations of bacidiomycete fungus 
Phanerochaete sordida . The decolourisation of azo dye mixt ures observed in the 
aforementioned study was attributed to the MnP activity of the culture. Similarly, in 
a study by Selvam et al, 2003, dye industry effluents containing azo dye mixtures 
were decolourised by white rot fungus Thelephora  sp. In this case, decolourisation 
was attributed to the fungal extracellular production of lignin peroxidase (LiP), 
laccase and MnP. Although white rot fungi are shown to non -specifically degrade a 
wide variety of poly aromatic compounds including azo dyes, the lignolytic 
oxidative enzyme production in liquid fermentations is known to be inconsistent 
(Robinson et al, 2001). This could be mainly due to the unfamiliar environment of 
liquid fermentations for wood degrading fungi as opposed to solid -state 
fermentations (SSF) whe re their natural environment is more closely simulated. 
Therefore, the use of adapted bacterial cultures rather than fungal cultures for 
rapid colour removal in colour industry effluent would be advantageous in 
operational standpoint.  
The results of this s tudy indicates that it is possible to achieve over 90% colour 
and COD removal in azo dye mixtures in a repeatable manner during fed -batch 
MFC operation (Figure s 4.2A and 4.2B). This highlights the potential advantages 
of using an adapted mixed microbial co nsortium for azo dye removal. The use of 
the electrochemically active environment of MFCs could confer additional benefits 
such as enhancing azo dye removal kinetics and concomitant bio -electricity 
production (Figure 4.2C). 113 
 4.2.3. Decolourisation and bio -electrochemical system 
performances under thermophillic and saline conditions  
4.2.3.1. The effect of operating temperature (Experiment -2) 
The kinetic constants for colour and COD removal indicated approximately a 6.5 
fold and 3.5 fold enhancements respectively when the operating temperature was 
raised from 20°C to 50°C (Table  4.1). This suggests that the adapted microbial 
consortium prefers thermophillic operation for dye decolourisation and COD 
reduction over mesophillic operation. The composition of the adapted microbial 
consortium determined by 16s rDNA analysis suggests that bacteria belonging to 
genera Clostridium  and Eubacterium  are predominant (Table  4.3). Many bacteria 
belonging to aforementioned genera are known to produce thermostable enzym es 
(Gomes an d Steiner , 1998) and known to function under thermophillic conditions 
(Lo et al , 2011). The effect of operating temperature was also reflected in the 
electrochemical performance of the MFC system where, peak power density 
obtainable from the system increased approximately two -fold from 13.22 ± 2.42 
mWm-2 to 25.6 ± 2.77 mWm-2 when the  operating conditions were changed from 
sub-mesophillic (20°C)  to thermophillic (50°C) (Table  4.1).

4.2.3.2. The effect of salinity (Experiment -3) 
The common auxiliary salts present in textile wet processing processes were 
added in this study by addition of varying (w/v %) amounts of NaCl and 
Na2SO 4.10H 2O (Glau ber’s salt) in a ratio of 1.1.

 The results indicated that reasonable decolourisation and COD removal kinetic 
rates can be maintained up -to a solution salt content of 2% (w/v). This 
performance deteriorated about 4.4 fold and 3.3 fold respectively in terms of colour 
and COD removal when the solution salt content was raised from 1% (w/v) to 2.5% 
(w/v). The high power densities of the MFC system observed at high salt content 
(1% - 2% w/v) could be due to the better electrochemical performance of 
electrochemically active bacteria at high ion ic strength. Similar to these findings, 
Liu et al, 2005 reported that high power densities yielded in single chamber MFCs 
inoculated with anaerobic mixed cultures at high (salt content - 0.6% - 2.3% w/v) 
ionic strengths. However, the salt content appears to  indicate an inhibitory effect 
on power output of the MFC system at 2.5% (w/v), suggesting that it may be out  of 
the tolerable range (Table  4.2). Colour industry wastewater often contains 
mixtures of azo dyes with a vast chemical structural diversity. More over, during 
textile wet processing, large amounts of sodium sulphate decahydrate (Glauber’s 
salt) and sodium chloride are added to improve the migration and fixation of dye 
molecules into the textile substrate. The temperature during textile wet processin g 
is maintained at around 90°C and the effluent is often  hot when discharged 
(Schlaeppi , 1998). A previous study aimed at characterising textile effluent 
generated from textile wet processing plants in south -east Asia reported salinities 
between 1% (w/v) – 3.3% (w/v) (Roy et al, 2010).  Therefore, the findings of this 
study indicating the potential industrial applicability of such systems employing 
robust, azo dye adapted mixed microbial consortia are promising.  116 
 4.2.3. Bacterial 16s rDNA community analysis of the 
original anaerobic digested sludge and azo dye/MFC 
adapted dye degrading culture  
Comparison of DGGE fingerprints of the original anaerobic digested sludge and 
azo dye/MFC adapted microbial cultures indicate different banding patters; 
suggesting that  a different microbial community becomes selected under the 
condit ions used in this study (Figure  4.3). 
 
Figure 4.3: 16s rDNA PCR -DGGE profiles of (A) original un -acclimated anaerobic 
digested sludge (B) azo dye/MFC acclimated microbial culture after appr oximately 
50 days of fed -batch operation (temperature -30°C).  
 
Phylogenetic analysis of 16s rDNA sequences obtained from the original 
anaerobic culture revealed that majority (87%) comprised of bacterial species 
belonged to genera Clostridium  and Eubacterium  (Figure  4.4A). Phylogenetic 
affiliations of the identified bacte rial species are shown in table  4.3. Many 
substrate types suitable for fermentative hydrogenic and methanogenic growth are 
117 
 encountered in anaerobic wastewater treatment pl ants (Ven kata Mohan , 2009). 
Therefore, a high proportion of such Firmicutes can be expected in anaerobically 
digested sludge.  
Clear differences in phylogenetic relationships can be observed between the 
original anaerobic microbial community and the dye/MFC adapted  microbial 
consortium capable of bio -decolourisation of azo dye mixtures. More Gram 
negatives belonging to phyla Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria were selected 
under t hese conditions (43%) (Figure 4.4B). This may be attributed to the 
electrochemically acti ve environment provided to the microbial community in the 
form of a microbial fuel cell. In earlier studies, Gram negative organisms such as 
Pseudomonas  sp. and Flavobacterium  sp. are reported to be responsible for 
extracellular electron transfer (EET)  in MFCs (Rabaey and Verstraete , 2005 and 
Nien et al , 2011). Some Flavobacterium  sp. are also known to be moderately 
halotolerant (Saha et al, 2006 and Yoshie et al, 2006).

The high proportion of Firmicutes such as Clostridium  sp. and Eubacterium  sp. 
found both in the un -adapted original anaerobic culture and the dye/MFC adapted 
bacterial consortium may explain the ability of the microbial community to operate 
efficiently under thermophillic conditions. Clostridium  species are well known for 
ferme ntative growth under thermophillic conditions (Lo et al, 2009 and Zverlov et 
al, 2010).  
Previous work by Park et al , 2001 was able to isolate and characterise a 
Clostridium  sp. closely related to Clostridium butyricum  from MFCs fed with starch 
processing wastewater. Further characterisation of the isolate revealed that the 
organism was capable of fermentative growth as well as neutral red reduction and 
Fe (III) reduction; suggesting that organism is electrochemically a ctive and 
capable of carrying out extracellular electron transfer. These findings implies that 
the Firmicutes that became selected during dye fed cycles within the 
121 
 electrochemically active environment of MFCs in this study may also be capable of 
extracellu lar electron transfer onto the electrode as well as the azo moiety of the 
dye compounds, leading to their effect ive reductive decolourisation.  
4.3. Conclu ding remarks  
The outcomes of this work implies that wastewater containing complex azo dye 
mixtures ca n be effectively decolourised under industrially relevant conditions such 
as high temperature and moderately saline conditions using an adapted anaerobic 
microbial consortium in MFCs. Efficient colour removal of the dye mix containing 
simulated wastewater and concomitant bio -electricity production was achieved 
using the unrefined co -substrate molasses as the electron donor. The molecular 
phylogenetic analysis conducted in this study demonstrated that bacteria 
belonging to phylum Firmicutes was predominant i n planktonic MFC anode 
solutions following long -term MFC operation. This work demonstrates that MFCs 
could potentially be employed as an efficient system for reductive colour removal 
from azo dye contaminated wastewater.

Summary  
The objective of this study was to fully biodegrade the  azo dye AO -7 using an 
integrated MFC -aerobic system  into non -toxic intermediates . Simulated 
wastewater containing AO -7 and the cheap, sustainable co -substrate molasses as 
the electron donor was continuously fed to the integrated set up of MFC -aerobic 
bioreactor system during experiments.  
In this st udy, the commercially used  azo dye Acid  Orange -7 (AO -7) was fully 
degraded into less toxic intermediates using an integrated microbial fuel cell (MFC) 
and aerobic bioreactor system. The integrated bioreactor system was operated at 
ambient temperature and continuous -flow mode. AO -7 loading rate was varied 
during experiments from 70 gm-3day-1 to 210 gm-3day-1. Colour and soluble COD 
removal rates reached > 90% under all AO -7 loading rates. The MFC treatment 
stage prompted AO -7 to undergo reductive degradation into its constituent 
aminobenzene s. HPLC -MS analysis of metabolite extracts from the aerobic stage 
of the bioreactor system indicated further oxidative degradation of the resulting 
aminobenzene s into simpler compounds. Eco -toxicity testing of the effluents using 
bioluminescent Vibrio fisc heri cells indicated that aerobic stage effluent indicated 
toxicity reductions of approximately five -fold and ten -fold respectively compared to 
the dye wastewater influent and MFC -stage effluent.

5.2. Results and discussion  
5.2.1. AO7 degradation, colour removal and soluble COD 
reduction during two -stage reactor operation  
The AO -7 loading rate was incrementally varied over the course of reactor 
operation from 70  gm-3day-1 to 210  gm-3day-1. However, the effluent AO -7 
concentrations measured at both the MFC stage and the aerobic stages of the 
integ rated bioreactor were below 8 mg L-1, indicated a high (>90%) AO -7 removal 
efficiency throughout the reactor operation. The incremental variation of AO -7 
feeding during continuous reactor operation did not adversely affect the AO -7 
removal efficiency of the integrated reactor system and >90% removal efficiencies 
were reached even at the hig hest AO -7 loading rate (210  gm-3day-1). This 
indicates the robustness of the integrated reactor system and the ability to deal 
with high pollutant loading rates. The reactor system was capable of sustaining the 
high removal rates throughout the long -term o peration (more than 150 days) 
without noticeable deterioration to colour removal or soluble COD removal 
performances.  The open circuit control reactor (analogous to a conventional 
anaerobic process) was unable to reach the same level of AO -7 decolourisati on 
compared to continuous MFC reactors under the same HRT at any of the three 
dye loading rates tested (Figure  5.1A). 
The removal of AO -7 during the two -stage operation suggests that largest 
proportion of AO -7 was degraded during the anoxic MFC stage of th e reactor 
operation. No noticeable AO -7 removal and hence, colour removal can be 
observed at the aerobic stage of the integrated reactor system. This suggests that 
AO-7 is only amenable to reductive biotransformation at the anoxic MFC stage but 125 
 the residua l AO-7 is recalcitrant under aerated latte r stage of the reactor (Figure  
5.1A). These observations corroborate well with the results of numerous other 
studies that demonstrated the reductive colour removal of various azo dyes and 
the recalcitrance of the u nreduced azo dyes under ae robic conditions (O’Neill et al , 
2000, Rajagur u et al, 2000, Shaul , 1991).  
 
Figure 5.1: (A) AO -7 removal during the two stage operation at various AO -7 
loading rates over a period of 150 days and (B) COD removal performance of the 
integrated bioreactor system at each stage  
 
Soluble COD reduction was observed during both MFC stage and the aerobic 
stage. However, the COD reduction during the MFC stage was only partial. The 
relatively high concentrations of soluble COD at the end of the MFC stage can be 
126 
 attributed to the residua l co-substrate (molasses) from the MFC stage and 
recalcitrant aminobenzene s resulting from the biological reduction process of AO -7. 
The further reduction of COD during the subsequent aerobic stage of the 
integrated reactor suggests that a larger proportio n of the molasses co -substrate 
and the amine biotransformation products have been consumed during the 
sequential MFC – aerobic treatment stages (Figure  5.1B). The total COD loading 
in the reactor system ranged f rom 1.044 kgCOD m-3day-1 (at 70g m-3day-1 AO-7 
loading rate) to 1.26 kgCOD m-3day-1 (at 210  gm-3day-1 AO-7 loading rate). This 
indicates that the integrated reactor system was capable of effectively dealing with 
high COD loading rates over prolonged operational periods (over 150 days) 
without suffering  a substantial reduction in COD removal efficiency. The COD 
value of molasses containing blank medium without AO -7 was measured to be 
2950 ± 60 mg COD L-1. Although the contribution of AO -7 to total COD 
concentration was relatively small (approximately 10% of total soluble COD at 210  
gm-3day -1 AO -7 loading rate), high COD removal efficiencies achieved (often 
above 90% removal) throughout the aerobic treatments stage suggests that 
refractory amines have been utilised by the bacterial mixed population for thei r 
carbon and energy needs. The integrated bioreactor system was operated at 
ambient temperature and temperature fluctuations had little or no apparent effect 
on colour removal efficiency or soluble COD reduction in the combined bioreactor 
stages. Particula rly, during winter months where the temperature was lower, no 
adverse effects on aforementioned parameters could be observed.  
5.2.2. Aminobenzene formation during the MFC stage and 
amine removal in the subsequent aerobic stage  
Effluent samples collected s ubsequent to the anoxic MFC stage indicated that 
both constituent aminobenzene s of AO -7 (4-aminobenzenesulfonic acid and 1 -127 
 amino -2-naphthol) were formed as a result of reductive azo bond cleavage. 
Increasing concentrations of both aminobenzene s were detect ed when the AO -7 
loading rate was elevated from 70  gm-3day-1 to 210  gm-3day-1 (Figures 5.2A and 
5.2B).  
 
Figure 5.2: (A) Removal of 1 -amino -2-naphthol within the MFC stage and aerobic 
stages of integrated bioreactor operation and (B) removal of 4 -
aminobenzenesulfonic acid (Sulfanilic acid) during the integrated bioreactor 
operation over a period of 150 days.  
 
The preva lent high concentrations of both amines at the anoxic MFC stage 
suggests that under the hydraulic retention time (HRT) the MFCs operate at, the 
MFC stage treatment is unable to degrade both aminobenzene s effectively and 
128 
 hence are washed out into the efflue nt entering the subsequent aerobic treatment 
stage of the reactor system.  
Effluent samples collected at the end of the aerobic treatment stage of the 
integrated reactor system however, indicated considerably smaller concentrations 
of both aminobenzene s. T his suggested that both constituent amines 4 -
aminobenzenesulfonic acid and 1 -amino -2-naphthol were amenable to further 
degradation under the aerobic conditions utilised in the latter stage of the 
integrated bioreactor in this study. The observed additional  reduction of soluble 
COD in the second aerobic stage of the reactor (Figure 5.1B) corroborates well 
with the data presented in figures 5.1A and 5.1B.  
Ortho -substituted aminophenols such as 1 -amino -2-naphthol are known for 
undergoing autoxidation reaction s to form more refractory and highly coloured 
polymeric products upon ex posure to oxygen (Kudlich et al , 1999). In this study 
however, no such accumulation of coloured, polymeric autoxidation products were 
observed. Especially at high AO -7 loadings (210  gm-3day-1) the effluent of the 
second stage was colourless and indicated no accumulation of coloured polymeric 
residues. This indicates that the aerobic stage of the reactor system is capable of 
effectively degrading autoxidation prone aminophenols such as 1 -amino -2-naphtol. 
Sulfonated aminobenzene s such as 4 -aminobenzoic acid are particularly known 
for the ir refractory nature (Gan et al , 2012). The use of azo dye adapted mixed 
microbial population in this study however, enabled 4 -aminobenzenesulfonic acid 
removal r ates up -to 74% even at the highest AO -7 loading (210  gm-3day-1) (Figure  
5.2B). 
In a very recent similar study, Cui et al , 2013 utilised a microbially assisted 
electrolysis system coupled to a subsequent aerobic stage to treat model 
wastewater containing th e azo dye Alizarin Yellow – R (AYR). However, thi s 129 
 process utilised by Cui et al , 2013 being an electrolysis system, it required the use 
of an exogenous power supply and was unable to operate effectively in the 
absence of power. Electrolysis processes for azo dye treatment are not favoured 
due to high operational costs. Furthermore, a toxicity assessment about the end 
products of the aerobic stage  was not conducted by Cui et al , 2013 in that study.  
5.2.3. Toxicity reduction during the two stage reactor 
operation  
Achieving low environmental toxicity of the effluents is important for any 
biotreatment strategy used for recalci trant waste removal (Ayed et al , 2011). Some 
aminobenzene s resulting from azo dye reductive biotransformation are 
demonstrated to be highly toxic to humans and other organisms includin g 
microorganisms (Skipper et al, 2010, Chen et al , 2009). Results of this study 
indicate that the amines formed at the end of the anoxic MFC stage induce a 
bioluminescence reduction toxicity effect on V.fischeri  cells (Figure  5.3). The half 
maximal luminescence inhibition value (EC 50) for the AO -7 containing synthetic 
wastewater influent and MFC effluent were 127  mgCOD L-1 and 63.3  mgCOD L-1 
respectively. The effluent of the MFC stage indicated a marked increase in the 
EC50 value (637  mgCODL-1) suggesting a significant (p < 0.01, ANOVA) reduction 
in toxicity compared to both MFC stage influent and MFC stage effluent. 
Interestingly, the low EC 50 value (high toxicity) of the dye wastewater influent 
suggests that the presence of unreduced AO -7 itself in high concentrations may 
contribute to high environmental toxicity.  130 
  
Figure 5.3: Vibrio fischeri  luminescence based toxicity determinations of MFC 
influent, MFC effluent and aerobic stage effluent at the highest AO -7 loading rate 
(210 gm-3day-1).  
 
Therefore, the results suggest that environmental toxicity of the samples were 
considerably reduced by subjecting the MFC stage effluent to aerobic post -
treatment. The toxicity of the aerobic stage effluent was approximately 5 -fold lower 
compared to synthetic wastewater influent and 10 -fold lower compared to amine 
containing MFC stage effluent. These findin gs corroborate well with few other 
previous studies where a reduction of toxicity was observed following aerobic 
treatment of decolourised azo  dye wastewater (Gottlieb et al, 2003, Kalme et al , 
2007).  
5.2.4. Biogenic electricity generation during AO -7 
degradation  
Tubular type MFC operation during AO -7 removal resulted in concomitant biogenic 
electricity production. Current density reached approximately 125  mAm-2 during 
MFC operation (across a 5 00 Ω). Current output during reactor operation was 
subject t o fluctuation, most likely due to wide temperature variations in the 
laboratory during the long  operational periods (Figure 5.4).

Open circuit control indicated an OCV of 641 ± 37 mV throughout the study (data 
not shown). Subsequent electrochemical performance characterisation of the 
MFCs at the end of the operational run using polarisation tests indicated maximum 
power de nsities of 51.9 ± 4 mWm-2 (Figure  5.5).

This demonstrates the ability of the two -stage bioreactor system to generate 
bioelectricity while degrading recalcitrant AO -7. The electron donor used in this 
study was a waste material and the anolyte medium did not include a buffering 132 
 system. Instead, co mmon textile wastewater auxiliary salts Na 2SO 4.10H 2O and 
NaCl was added to adjust the ionic strength. This demonstrates the potential 
practical applications of an MFC -aerobic reactor system for complete degradation 
of colour industry wastewater and concomi tant bioelectricity production.  
5.2.5. Degradation of aminobenzene s in the aerobic 
second stage  
HPLC analysis of the metabolite extracts of effluent samples from the aerobic 
stage of the two -stage reactor indicated that numerous degradatio n products were 
formed (Figure  5.6A). The aminobenzene s were degraded into several different 
simpler metabolites during the aerobic treatment stage and this suggests that 
oxidative degradation of aminobenzene s is the most effective way of removing 
them from colour industr y wastewater. These findings are further reinforced by the 
COD removal and toxicity reduction data. A further reduction of COD from the 
anoxic first stage (MFC stage) effluent was observed in the aerobic second stage. 
A concomitant and marked reduction of toxicity was also observed in the aerobic 
stage effluent compared to the MFC stage effluent, suggesting that aminobenzene 
reductive biotransformation products were degraded into simpler non -toxic 
metabolites.  133

4.3 min) and (B) FTIR spectra overlay of the extracts of AO -7 containing influent 
and the aerobic stage effluent

 5.2.6. Putative biodegradation pathway of AO -7  
Based on the HPLC -MS identification of the AO -7 biotransformation metabolites, a 
putative biodegradation pathway is suggested. Products of reductive 
biotransformation (MFC stage) of AO -7 were identified as 1 -amino -2-naphthol and 
4-aminobenzenesulfonic acid by HPLC peaks compared to authen tic standard 
compounds (Figure  5.6A – inset). These biotransformation products are further 
catabolised into simpler and less toxic metabolites at the latter aerobic stage of the 
integrated bioreactor system. The suggested biodegradation pathways based on 
identified HPLC -MS intermediates for  4-aminobenzenesulfonic acid and 1 -amino -
2-naphthol are depicted in figures 5.7A and 5.7B respectively.  135 
  
Figure 5.7: Putative aerobic biodegradation pathways of (A) 4 -
aminobenzenebenzenesulfonic acid and (B) 1 -amino -2-naphthol based on 
intermediates identified by HPLC -MS 
 
The formation of 4 -aminophenol (M+H+ = 110.2, R t = 14.4 min) from 4 -
aminobenzenesulfonic acid under  aerobic conditions suggests an aerobic de -
sulfonation reaction, probably due to the action of mono -oxygenase enzymes. 
Similar de -sulfonation reactions on sulfonated aminobenzene s catalysed by mono -
136 
 oxygenase enzymes were earlie r reported by Kalme et al , 20 07. They 
demonstrated that Pseudomonas desmolyticum  NCIM 2112 was capable of 
carrying out a series of oxidative de -sulfonation reactions using mono -oxygenase 
enzymes on azo dyes carrying multiple sulfonic acid groups. Formation of 1, 4 -
benzenediol (M+H+ = 111.3, R t = 19.1 min) from 4 -aminophenol suggests that 
oxidative de -amination to form a benzenediol derivative. Mono -oxygenases are 
also known to catalyse de -amination reactions of aminobenzene s to form catechol 
derivatives (Junker et al , 1994). The sequen tial de -sulfonation and de -amination of 
4-aminobenzenesulfonic acid to form 1, 4 -benzenediol indicates the action of 
mono -oxygenases and further suggests that di -oxygenases may not be involved in 
the aromatic ring activation reactions. The sequential aroma tic ring activation 
reactions catalysed by mono -oxygenase could eventually lead to oxidative 
aromatic ring opening (formation of 4 -hydroxymuconic semialdehyde) (M+H+ = 
143.2, R t = 9.8 min) (Takenaka et al , 2003).  
Similar to the oxidative deamination of 4-aminobenzenesulfonic acid by the action 
of mono -oxygenase, the formation of 1, 2 -naphthalenediol (M+H+ = 161.2, R t = 
22.6 min) suggests that 1 -amino -2-naphthol undergoes oxidative de -amination, 
most probably due to the action of a mono -oxygenase. Followi ng the activation of 
one aromatic ring in the form of a naphthalenediol structure, it becomes 
susceptible to further oxidative catabolism. The intradiol cleavage of 1, 2 -
naphthalenediol leads to the formation of 2 -carboxycinnamic acid (M+H+ = 193.2, 
Rt = 11.5 min). Beta -oxidation -like two -carbon shortening of the opened aromatic 
ring of 2 -carboxycinnamic acid may eventually lead to the formation of Benzene -1, 
2-dioic acid (Phthalic acid) ([M+2H]2+ = 84.0, R t = 11.1 min). In an earlier stu dy 
conducted by Ann weiler et al , 2000 on aerobic naphthalene degradation by 
Bacillus thermoleovorans , it was demonstrated that naphthalene is catabolised by 137 
 the bacterium for its carbon and energy needs via the intermediates 2, 3 -
naphthalenediol, 2 -carboxycinnamic acid, phth alic acid and benzoic acid. Benzoic 
acid can be further catabolised and its intermediates can be fed into TCA cycle 
relatively easily in benzoate degr adation pathways (Nogales et al , 2010). 
Therefore, the intermediates of AO -7 degradation entering TCA cycl e could lead to 
mineralisation.  
The use of an azo dye adapted mixed microbial population in this study gives an 
additional advantage of a larger diversity of aerobic degradation pathways for 
recalcitrant compounds such as aminobenzene s (Saratale et al , 2009). The dye 
adapted mixed microbial culture used in this s tudy has been characterised in the 
work described in chapter 4, and several Pseudomonas  species were identified. 
Earlier studies indicated that many Pseudomonas  species are capable of 
converting re calcitrant sulfonated aminobenzene s to more biodegradable 
compounds with the action of mono and di -oxygenase enzymes (Kalme et al , 
2000). The possible action of mono -oxygenases in de -sulfonation and de -
amination reactions of sulfonated aminobenzene s observed in this study could be 
due to the production of such enzymes by numerous Pseudomonads present in 
the mixed microbial population.  
The FTIR spectroscopy of the influent sample indicated a characteristic peak for 
the aromatic azo bond ( -N=N-) stretch  at 1503 cm-1.  Furthermore, peaks 
characteristic for the S=O stretch and S -O stretch of sulfonic acid groups were 
evident at wavenumbers 1402 cm-1 and 1182 cm-1. In the FTIR spectra of the 
extracts from the aerobic stage effluent however, the peaks for th e azo moiety at 
1503 cm-1 and the sulfonic acid groups at 1402 cm-1 and 1182 cm-1 were absent; 
suggesting that the unreduced azo moieties and intact sulfonic acid groups were 
absent in the treated effluent. Aerobic stage effluent produced peaks characteris tic 138 
 for the carbonyl stretch (C=O) of the carboxylic acids and aldehydes (at 1626 cm-1), 
O-H stretch of carboxylic acids (3330 cm-1), C-H stretch of aldehydes and C -O 
stretch of catechols and naphthols (at 1040 cm-1). Additional peaks characteristic 
of N-H2 wagging of aminobenzene s (at 821 cm-1) and O -C stretch of carboxylic 
acids were also identifiable in the aerobic stage extracts. The FTIR spectra 
indicate that the aerobic stage extracts are distinctly different to the AO -7 
containing influent with regar ds to its chemical nature. The formation of catechol 
and naphthalenediol derivatives, aldehydes and carboxylic acids with the 
concomitant elimination of the azo moieties and sulfonic acid groups of AO -7 is 
further supported by FTIR ana lysis of the samples (Figure  5.6B).  
Sequential reduction of soluble COD in the two stages of the integrated bioreactor 
system, the formation of numerous metabolites in the aerobic degradation stage 
and the marked reduction of environmental toxicity suggests that AO -7 is 
completely degraded t o non -toxic intermediates by the mixed microbial population 
in the combined MFC -aerobic bioreactor. The use of continuous bioreactors 
utilising waste materials such as molasses for the treatment of recalcitrant wastes 
are particularly favoured due to indus trial applicability and cost considerations. 
Moreover, the use of unbuffered anode medium for the continuous MFC anode 
further enhances the cost effectiveness of this reactor system because the use of 
buffered media for wastewater treatment is highly disad vantageous in cost and 
operational standpoints. The prospect of biogenic electricity production during azo 
dye removal is an added advantage of using tubular MFC systems such as the 
ones used in the current study. The integrated bioreactor system tested in  this 
study was also capable of operating successfully under wide temperature 
fluctuations (14.6°C - 26°C). This is another potential advantage for industrial 
applications because exogenous temperature regulation is known to be costly and 139 
 hence, a bioreact or system that could tolerate a wide temperature range would be 
advantageous. The findings of this study further implies that MFC technology can 
be used in combination with activated sludge communal wastewater treatment 
systems in order to sustainably deal  with recalcitrant colour industry wastewater.  
5.2.7. The effect of shock AO -7 loadings on MFC 
operation  
For a continuous bioreactor being developed for potential colour industry waste 
treatment applications, it is necessary to possess the ability to wit hstand shock 
loadings of xenobiotics and COD levels. In colour industry waste streams, it is 
likely to encounter very high dye concentrations and COD levels. Therefore, any 
potential MFC based system developed for this purpose must be robust enough to 
withstand such conditions. Hence, as part of this study , shock AO -7 loadings of 
400 mg L-1 were introduced in order  to monitor the response  of the MF C stage from 
such a shock load.

 Following an initial lag of about 10 hours, the AO -7 concentration indica ted a rapid 
decrease (Figure  5.8) suggesting that the MFC stage was capable of withstanding  
shock loadings  of AO7 . However, the AO -7 concentration to fall below 50 mg L-1 
took approximately 75 hours. This could be due to the high level of cytotoxicity 
originating from the formation of very high quantities of aminobenzene s during the 
reductive decolourisation process.  
5.3. Conclu ding remarks  
The findings of this study demonstrate that an integrated MFC -aerobic bioreactor 
configuration is capable of achieving complete biodegradation of the model azo 
dye AO -7. The two -stage process was capable of bringing about significan t 
reductions in environmental toxicity, colour and soluble COD of the model 
wastewater, coupled with simultaneous bio -electricity generation. The 
aminobenzene s generated at the end of the anaerobic MFC stage were effectively 
converted to non -toxic and simp ler compounds at the end of the aerobic reactor 
operation. This integrated bioreactor system was capable of using  a cheap and 
sustainable electron donor (molasses), mixed microbial populations, sustain longer 
operational periods (150 days) in continuous fl ow mo de and was able  to operate at 
ambient temperature under wide temperature fluctuations (often low temperatures) . 
Therefore, this indicates the potential colour industry wastewater treatment 
applications of the integrated bioreactor system  described in this study .

 Summary  
The scalability of any MFC based system is of vital importance if they are to be 
utilised for potential field application s. In this study, a n MFC – aerobic  integrated 
bioreactor system was investigated  for its scalability for the p urpose of treatment 
of simulated  colour industry wastewater containing the model azo dye AO -7 and 
two types of real col our industry wastewater. A volumetric MFC scale -up factor of 
6 (200 mL to 1200 mL reactor volume at MFC stage) from the previous study 
(reactor system described in chapter -5) was used. The real colour industry 
wastewater originated from acid dyebaths for w ool colouring and leather tanning . 
The influent containing real wastewater was fed to the reactor in continuous mode  
at ambient temperature . Three MFC units were integrated to act in unison as a 
single module for wastewater treatment and an aerobic bioreactor mimicking an 
activated sludge system operating downstream to the MFC module was installed 
in order to ensure more complete degradation of colouring agents found in the real 
wastewater. Total colour removal in the final effluent exceeded 90% in all 
experiments where both synthetic (AO -7 containing) and real wastewater was 
used as the influent feed. The COD reduction also exceeded 80% in al l 
experiments under the same conditions. The MFC modules connected in parallel 
configuration allowed obtaining higher current densities than that can be obtained 
from a single MFC unit. The maximum current density of the MFC stack reached 
1150 mAm-2 when c onnected in parallel configuration. The outcome of this work 
implies that suitably up -scaled MFC – aerobic integrated bioprocesses could be 
used for colour industry wastewater treatment in industrially relevant conditions 
with possible prospects of bio -electricity generation.

 6.2. Results and discussion  
6.2.1. Decolourisation and COD removal in AO -7 
containing model wastewater in the scaled up MFC -
aerobic reactor system  
It was demonstrated earlier (Chapter 5 ) that MFC - aerobic integrated reactor 
system was capable of fully degrading AO -7 containing simulated colour industry 
wastewater into non -toxic simpler metabolites . The modular scale – up of the 
same two – stage system was tested initially in continuous mod e in this study 
using the same syntheti c medium containing AO -7 (35 mg L-1).  
 
Figure 6.1: (A) Colour removal of the model wa stewater containing AO -7 (35 mg L-
1) fed into the scaled -up MFC system in the MFC and aerobic stages and (B) 
residual COD of the samples taken in the MFC and aerobic stages  
144 
  
The results indicate that the colour and COD removal reached above 90% and 
therefore, the performance of the scaled -up two -stage MFC -aerobic reactor 
system was comparable to the similar but smaller reactor syste m (200 mL working 
volume) utilised in the previous study described in chapter  5 (Figure 6.1A and 
6.1B). This suggests that the integrated MFC -aerobic two -stage reactor system is 
capable of operating without any deterioration of its colour and COD removal 
performances when it is scaled -up by a volume scale factor of 6 (1200 mL total 
working volume in the three integrated MFC modules) and operating on the same 
synthetic wastewater medium containi ng AO -7. Previously (chapter  5) it was 
demonstrated that an MFC – aerobic two stage reactor set – up was the ideal 
configuration for more complete degradation and toxicity removal of azo dyes such 
as AO -7. Therefore, the same two – stage MFC aerobic reactor set up was used in 
the up -scaled model reactor.  
6.2.2. Decolo urisation of real colour industry wastewater 
in the scaled up system  
For any potential wastewater treatment system tested for field application, it is 
essential to possess the capability to effectively deal with real wastewater types. 
This is especially re levant to biological wastewater treatment systems developed 
for the removal of xenobiotic compounds. Although the use of model wastewater 
often containing a single dye is ubiquitous in many studies done in this area, the 
use of real colour industry wastewa ter is relatively rare. It is not always possible 
and adequate to extrapolate the information obtained from studies utilising model 
wastewater into a scenario where real colour industry wastewater is encountered. 
Therefore, it is essential to conduct exper iments utilising real colour industry 
wastewater when attempting to scale up prospective wastewater treatment 145 
 systems. Therefore, in this study, two types of real colour industry wastewater 
were tested; namely, acid dyebath wastewater from wool colouring a nd acid 
dyebath wastewater from leather tanning.  
When using real colour industry wastewater from wool colouring, the effluent from 
the MFC stage and the aerobic stage indicated a slow, sequential colour reduction 
during the start – up phase (Figure  6.2). Subsequently however, both MFC and 
aerobic stages reached high colour removal performances exceeding 90% 
decolourisation (Figure 6.3A).

Therefore, similar to the pr evious study that used an integrated MF C – aerobic 
process (chapter  5), it can be expected that due to the stepwise and sequential 
COD reduction,  some of the decolourisation metabolites formed in the anaerobic 
MFC stage are further oxidised into simpler co mpounds during the aerobic stage.

Similar to the previous observations with real colour industry wastewater from wool 
colouring, the intense colour of the influent was almost completely removed from 
real wastewater originating from leather tanning when it was used as the influent 
feed for the scaled -up integrated MFC – aerobic reactor system (figure 6.4). This 
clearly suggest s that the scaled -up integrated MFC module coupled to the aerobic 
reactor system is capable of effectively removing colour from both types of real 
colour industry wastewater tested in this study. The final colour removal efficiency 
of the combined MFC -aerobic stages of the reactor reached over 90% (Figure 
6.5A) when leather tanning wastewater was used as the influent. This clearly 
demonstr ates that the  scaled -up integrated MFC – aerobic system is a versatile 
bioreactor system that can effectively deal with different types of real colour 
industry wastewater.

system when using real colour industry wastewater originating from leather 
tanning during the MFC stage and aerobic stage (B) COD removal performance 
during MFC stage and aerobic stage.  
 
Residual COD levels of the samples also indicated a stepwise reduction at the end 
of the MFC stage and the aerobic stage compared to the influent COD when real 
leather tanning wastewater was used as the influent. This suggests that 
decolourisation metabo lites were further oxidised into simpler compounds at the 
aerobic reactor stage of the integrated system. The unmodified (without the 
addition of the co -substrate molasses) COD values for the two types of real 
waste waters were 1000 ± 60 mgL-1 and 1280 ± 40  mgL-1 respectively for wool 
colouring wastewater and leather tanning wastewater. The residual COD values of 
the final effluent exiting  from the aerobic stage when both types of real wastewater 
149 
 were used in the scal ed – up reactor system were  below 500 mg L-1 (figures 6.3B 
and 6.5B). This clearly suggests that organic components contained in the two 
types of wastewater (including colouring agents) were oxidised in a stepwise 
manner during the process into simpler and colourless compounds. When leather 
tannin g wastewater was used as the influent, colour removal at the end of the 
MFC stage remained at 80% or below , but the overall colour removal of the 
combined MFC + aerobic process was over 90% . This is in contrast to other work 
done using this two stage system. When azo dyes (i.e. AO -7) was used as the 
model compounds in synthetic wastewater, most of the colour removal (˃ 90%) 
occurred at the MFC stage rather than at the aerobic stage because m ost azo 
moieties (-N=N-) undergo reductive degradation in the anaerobic MFC stage. 
However, contrary to the observations relating to azo dyes such as AO -7, when 
leather tanning wastewater was used as the influent, the aerobic stage accounted 
for more than 10% of the  total decolourisation (Figure  6.5A). This suggests that 
leather tanning real wastewater used here may contain other types of dyes 
belonging to dye classes such as anthraquinone or triphenylmethane dyes  which 
could be amenable to degradation in t he aerobic reactor stage .  
6.2.3. Electrochemical performance of the parallel 
connected MFC modules during real and simulated 
wastewater treatment  
Connecting stacked MFCs in series configuration could lead to undesirable energy 
losses due to effects such a s voltage reversal and potential drop across each MFC 
unit when connected in series. Voltage reversal is thought to occur due to sudden 
fuel starvation in the anode of one or more MFCs in an MFC stack and as a result, 
a sudden loss of bacterial catalytic a ctivity transferring electron s to the anode 
(Aelterman et al, 2006, Ieropoulos et al, 2008, Oh and Logan , 2006 ). However, 150 
 voltage reversal is mainly encountered during batch operation of MFC stacks and 
hence, operating MFCs in continuous mode and by ensuri ng good mixing, the 
undesirable energy losses of vol tage reversal could be circumvented . The voltage 
drop across each MFC during a series connection of an MFC stack mainly occurs 
due to the internal r esistance of MFCs (Zhuang et al , 2012). MFC systems when  
used as a single unit, suffer from the intrinsic theoretical maximum voltage output  
upper limit of about 1.2 Volts . However, due to various internal energy lo sses as 
discussed in chapter  1, the actual voltage obtained under field conditions is lower 
than 1.2 V. Therefore, when scaling up MFC systems, it is essential to connect 
multiple MFC units in either series or parallel configurations in order to obtain 
useful and high enough voltage or current outputs. Parallel connection of multiple 
MFCs is useful in  terms of obtaining high current densities.  
The current production of an MFC module during AO -7 containing simulated 
wastewater is depicted in figure  6.6. Current densities across a R ext of 500 Ω 
reached a maximum of approximately 200  mAm-2 and stayed relatively stable 
throughout continuous reactor operation.

When the MFC modules were connected in paral lel configuration, maximum 
current  densities as high as 1150 mAm-2 could be obtained while the maximum 
power density obtainable from the parallel connected MFC modules remained a 
modest 54  mWm-2 (Figure  6.8). However, the OCP remained at 27 5 mV. This 
indicates that the parallel connected MFC units allows drawing a larger  maximum 
current while the maximum power density obtainable from such parallel connected 
MFC units is not notably different to the maximum power that can be drawn 
compared to a single MFC unit. The OCP of the parallel connected MFCs (275 
mV) remained close  to that of a single MFC unit (297 mV), indicating that no 
significant enhancement of voltage output is possible in parallel MFC 152 
 configuration. These findings are in agreement with an earlier study conducted by 
Zhuang et al , 2012 in which they used paralle l and series connected MFC stacks 
and found that current outputs can be enhanced when the MFC units are stacked 
in parallel configuration with no significant enhancement to the voltage output or 
power density.

6.2.4. Degradation of colouring agents in real colour 
industry wastewater in th e MFC – aerobic two stage 
process  
Effective colour removal from both types of colour industry wastewater was 
achieved using the scaled – up MFC -aerobic bioreactor system as shown in 
figures 6.3 and 6.5. However, it is necessary to assess the degradation of  various 
colouring components contained within real colour industry wastewater during the 
two stage treatment process. Comparison of HPLC elution profiles of the influents 
and the effluents at various stages of the two stage process was carried out for 
this purpose.

molasses without colour industry wastewater), real leather tanning wastewater 
supplemented  with molasses (influent), the effluent from MFC stage and the 
effluent from the aerobic stage of the integrated scaled – up bioreactor system  
 
HPLC analysis of the samples obtained from the two -stage operation reactor when 
leather tanning wastewater was u sed as the reactor feed indicates that numerous 
metabolites were produced at the end of the aerobic stage of  the treatment 
process (Figure  6.9). The HPLC spectrum of the aerobic stage effluent (final 
effluent) was markedly different from the HPLC spectra o f the blank medium, real 
wastewater influent feed and the MFC stage effluent.

from wool colouring. Compared chromatograms indicate real colour industry 
wastewater from wool colouring, MFC stage effluent and aerobic stage effluent of

HPLC chromatograms of the samples obtained from the integrated bioreactor 
system operating on wool colouring real wastewater being used as the influent 
feed also indicated that many metabolites were  produced  at the end of the 
decolourisation pr ocess in the final effluent (aerobic stage effluent)  (Figure 6.10) . 
The chromatograms indicate that during the decolourisation process of both types 
of wastewater, a clear biotransformation of the colouring agents contained in the 
wastewater takes place. F urthermore, the number of metabolites produced at the 
end of the aerobic stage is greater than the number of metabolites present at the 
end of anaerobic MFC stage in both instances where two different types of colour 
industry wastewater was used  (Figures 6 .9 and 6.10) . This clearly indicates that 
decolourisation metabolites produced as a result of biotransformation of colouring 
agents at the MFC stage undergoes further catabolism into simpler compounds in 
155 
 the aerobic stage. These findings are simil ar to ear lier findings presented  in 
chapter  5, where simulated colour industry wastewater containing AO -7 as the 
model azo dye compound underwent a sequential biotransformation into 
aminobenzene s and then other simpler organic compounds in a similar MFC – 
aerobic combined bioreactor process.  
6.3. Conclu ding remarks  
The findings of this study indicate  that the MFC – aerobic integrated bioreactor 
system could be successfully s caled up to suitable scales  using numerous MFC 
modules in order to handle larger colour industry wastewater volumes. The system 
was capable of effectively handling real wastewater originating from acid dyebaths 
for wool colouring and leather tanning in continuous flow mode at ambient 
temperature. The parallel configured MFC connection of numerous MFC modules 
allowed the current that can be drawn from the system to be enhanced. The 
findings of this  study  implies that suitably scaled – up MFC stacks operating in 
continuous flow m ode could potentially be incorporated with aerobic processes 
such as activated sludge systems in order to treat complex colour industry 
wastewater. This brings about possibilities of effective colour industry wastewater 
treatment, good colour removal, deto xification and potential energy recovery with 
the use of MFCs during wastewater treatment.

 Summary  
Azo moieties  of polar and highly charged  dyes are thought to undergo reductive 
degradation into constituent amines in the extracellular milieu of bacterial cells due 
to their inability to penetrate into cellular interior. The aims of this study were to 
investigate the influence of MFC external resistance on azo dye reductive 
degradation kinetics, to investigate microbial community shifts under various R exts 
and to investigate the influence of exogenous addition of synthetic redox 
mediators on azo dye red uctive degradation in MFC anodes. In this study, 
experiments were conducted in MFCs  to investigate the influence o f applied 
external resistance  on the reductive decolourisation kinetics of three structurally 
different commercial azo dyes. The results indic ate that at very high current 
densities (low R ext) and very low current densities (high R ext), the reductive 
decolourisation kinetic constants were lower for all three tested azo dyes in 
comparison to a moderate optimum R ext (2.2 kΩ), close to the internal  resistance 
of the MFC systems. PCR -DGGE of the 16s rRNA gene microbial community 
fingerprints were distinctly different between experiments that utilised different 
Rexts. Molecular phylogenetic microbial profiling indicated that the microbial 
communities selected at different R exts were distinctly different. Exogenous 
supplementation of the two synthetic electron shuttling compounds Antharquinone -
2,6-disulfonic acid  (AQDS) and Anthraquinone -2-sulfonic acid  (AQS) was found to 
enhance decolourisation kinetic  constants of AO -7 reductive degradation. The 
enhanced de colourisation kinetic constants obtained using a moderate R ext 
indicates that R ext can be used as a potential tool for influencing azo dye reductive 
degradation in MFCs.  
The experimental outcomes of the work described in this chapter were published in, Fernando, E., Keshavarz, T., Kyazze, 
G., 2014b. External resistance as a potential tool for influencing azo dye reductive decolourisation kinetics in microbial fu el 
cells. I nternational Biodeterioration & Biodegradation 89, 7 -14 158 
 7.2. Results and discussion  
7.2.1. Azo dye degradation kinetics and MFC external 
resistance  
The reductive azo dye degradation constants were significantly higher (p <  0.05) 
compared to open circuit controls under all tested external resistances. This was 
observed for all three azo dyes used in this study (Figures 7.1A, 7.1B and 7.1C). 
This suggests that the transfer of reducing equivalents to the azo moiety is more 
efficient in the electrochemically active environment of an MFC anode in 
comparison to open circuit controls. A similar trend was observed in a previous 
study conducted by Kalathil et al , 2012 who reports that a MFC system treating 
real textile wastewater (R ext = 50  Ω) indicated 75% colour removal in 48 hours 
compared to 62% colour removal in a similar time -scale in an open circuit MFC. 
The open circuit controls (infinite R ext) are analogous to an anaerobic reactor, 
where the microbes must resort to utilising alternative terminal electron acceptors 
due to the absence of a functional anode.  The highest reductive azo dye 
degradation constants ( k) were observed for all tested dyes at the external 
resistance 2.2  kΩ and the ( k) values were significantly higher (p <  0.05, ANOVA) 
compared to ( k) values at other tested external resistances. Moreover, this trend 
was observed for all three structurally different azo dyes tested in this study. 
Considering the large molecular weight of the tested azo dyes and their highly 
charged nature, it can be expected that these dyes are incapable of crossing non -
polar biological membranes and penetrating into cellular interior of anolyte 
microorganisms. Therefore, the transfer of reducing equivalents to reduce azo 
moieties would occur  extracellularly. The experimental evidence in this study 
suggests that the efficient exo -electrogenic nature of anode microorganisms 
enhances the rate of azo dye reductive degradation under an optimum external 159 
 resistance. The internal resistance of the MF C systems (estimated using 
polarisation slope method) used in this study varied between 655 ± 2.2 Ω - 1020 ± 
3.7 Ω at all tested extern al resistances. Menicucci et al , 2006 reported that 
maximum sustainable current and power obtainable from an MFC system i s 
greatly influenced by the applied external resistance. Therefore, this ‘optimum’ 
external resistance may affect the external electron transfer efficiency of the 
anodic exo -electrogens and may eventually influence azo dye reductive 
degradation kinetics as  observed in the current study.  In terms of terminal 
electron acceptor availability for microbial metabolism, it could be expected that 
under higher R ext, more reducing equivalents will be transferred to azo moieties 
utilised as alternative terminal elect ron acceptors. But interestingly, in this study, 
low azo dye reductive decolourisation rates under high R ext (10 kΩ and 46  kΩ) for 
all three azo dyes tested were observed. Under high external resistances, mostly 
fermentative and methanogenic microbial comm unities become selected in MFCs 
and the environment for exo -electrogenic bacteria becom es unfavourable (Jung 
and Regan , 2011). Therefore, this unfavourable environment for exo -electrogens 
under high R ext may account for the low azo dye reductive decolouris ation rates 
observed in this study. Conversely, under low R ext (high current densities), the 
anode and the azo moieties are competitive terminal electron acceptors and 
therefore, may account for the low azo dye decolourisation rates observed at low 
Rext (10 Ω and 510  Ω) in this study. This is also reflected in the 16s rRNA PCR -
DGGE microbial community fingerprints where less microbial diversity is observed 
at very high and very low R exts (Figure  7.4A). 
Findings o f a previous study by Cai et al , 2011 utilisi ng the well -known 
electrochemically active microorganism Shewanella oneidensis  MR-1 and 
sulfonated azo dye Methyl Orange (MO) as the electron acceptor for anaerobic 160 
 growth, indicated that S.oneidensis  can utilise its Mtr respiratory pathway in order 
to transfer electrons extra cellularly on -to the azo moiety. Mtr respiratory pathway 
is demonstrated to be essential for reversibly reducing electron carriers such as 
flavins and electrodes poised at a suit able potential in MF C environments 
(Coursolle et al , 2010). The findings of the current study indicates that the 
efficiency of direct/mediated extracellular electron transfer by the MFC anode exo -
electrogenic bacteria on -to the azo moiety of structurally d iverse azo dyes can be 
conveniently varied by applied external resistance.

resistances compared to open circuit controls of A) AO7 B) RR3 and C) DY106 
(starting dye conc entration for all dyes is 50 mg L-1). 
 
The decolourisation kinetic constants ( k) at 2.2  kΩ indicated 3.2 fold, 1.75 fold and 
3.8 fold enhancements compared to ( k) values of experiments conducted at low 
162 
 Rext (10Ω), for AO7, RR3 and DY106 respectively. Similarly, (k) values of 
decolourisation for AO7, RR3 and DY106 respectively, at 2.2  kΩ were 3 fold, 1.95 
fold and 2.1 fold higher compared to (k) values at high R ext (46 kΩ).  
7.2.2. Simultaneous power producti on in MFCs coupled 
to azo dye degradation under various external 
resistances  
The power densities of MFCs operating under various external resistances 
indicate a similar trend to the decolourisation kinetic constants observed in this 
study. In the three exp eriments utilising AO7, RR3 and DY106 in the anodes,  their 
highest power densities were observed when an external resistance of 2.2 kΩ was 
applied.  P max values at 2.2  kΩ R ext reached 52  mWm-2, 48.3  mWm-2 and 40.4  
mWm-2 respectively during AO7, RR3 and DY106 reductive degradation in the 
anode  (Figure  7.2). The maximum power densities obtained at 2.2kΩ external 
resistance for all three azo dyes were significantly higher (P<0.05) than those 
obtained at external resistances  10 Ω and 46 kΩ. These findings on power 
densities observed at high current densities (low R ext) are in agreement with the 
findings of the earlier stud y conducted by Menicucci et al , 2006. Contrary to 
findings of this study and the findings by Menicucci et  al, 2006 however, Lyon et 
al, 2010 found that external resistance has little effect on MFC power production. 
Furthermore, the findings of this study on power densities from the MFCs 
produced under different external resistances during concomitant reductiv e 
degradation of all three azo dyes corroborate wi th the findings by Katuri et al , 
2011.  163

during concomitant azo dye degradation in the MFC anode with different applied 
external resistances.  
 
7.2.3. COD reduction in MFCs during azo dye reductive 
decolourisation under various extern al resistances  
COD reduction (after 72 hours of MFC operation) during azo dye degradation 
indicated that at high current densities (low R ext -10Ω), the effluent quality was 
significantly better (p<0.01, one way ANOVA with Tukey post -test) compared to 
open circuit controls for all tested azo dyes (Figure  7.3). In experiments conducted 
with three model azo dyes, the COD reduction under all tested external 
resistances was better compared to open circuit controls.  
164

during decolourisation experiments of three model azo dyes under various R ext        
(* and ** indicates p<0.05 and p<0.01 respectively; one way ANOVA and Tukey 
post-test).  
 
However, the differences in COD removal between  low R ext (10 Ω) and 2.2  kΩ R ext 
were not statistically significant in all experiments (p<0.05, one way ANOVA with 
Tukey post -test). This clearly indicates that enhanced azo dye decolourisation 
rates can be achieved by using an ‘optimum’ R ext for a given M FC system without 
any significant deterioration of COD removal and MFC power production.  
7.2.4. Microbial community variations in MFCs under 
different external resistances  
DGGE fingerprints reflecting the different microbial communities selected under 
different R exts were distinctly di fferent from each other (Figure  7.4A shows the 
DGGE fingerprints of MFCs operated under different R exts utilising AO -7 as the 
model azo dye). Interestingly, the microbial community DGGE profiles did not 
significantly diffe r from each other when different dyes were used. DGGE 
fingerprint profiles of MFCs operating under the same R ext but different azo dyes 
(i.e. AO -7, RR -3 and DY -106) did not differ from each other (DGGE fingerprints 
165 
 are not shown for RR -3 and DY -106 experim ents). Moreover, UPGMA cluster 
analysis indicates that the bacterial community profiles developed under different 
Rexts distinctly differ from each other and from t he open circuit control (Figure  
7.4B).  
 
Figure 7.4: (A) DGGE fingerprints during AO -7 decolourisation in MFCs operating 
under various R exts. Lanes 1 -6 respectively were MFCs operating under 1 - 10 Ω, 2 - 
510 Ω, 3 - 2.2 kΩ, 4 - 10 kΩ, 5 - 46 kΩ and 6 - open circuit (OC) control. (B) UPGMA 
cluster dendrogram using  Jaccard’s coefficient generated from the DGGE 
fingerprints. The scale bar at the bottom indicates percentage similarity based on 
Jaccard’s coefficient and the figures on the branches represent the distance 
between the clusters generated.  
 
This further su ggests that the different azo dye used has little or no influence on 
the microbial community selected, whereas the applied external resistance exerts 
a major effect on the selection of different microbial communities in the MFC 
anode. Furthermore, the micr obial diversity appeared to be enhanced at moderate 
external resistances (510 Ω and 2.2 kΩ R exts – lanes 2 and 3) compared to 
extreme low (10  Ω – lane -1) extreme high (46 kΩ – lane -5) R exts. These 
enhancements in bacterial diversity observed at moderate Rexts may account for 
the enhanced colour removal and power performances observed when the MFC 
systems are operated at moderate external resistances (close to R int) in this study.

 Identification of various bacterial communities selected under various external 
resistances were identified and profiled using 16s rDNA fingerprinting (Table  7.1).

 Phylogenetic analysis of microbial communities selected at various external 
resistances and open circuit conditions indicate significant differences in  microbial 
identities (Table  7.1). At open circuit conditions (controls) where the cathode is 
unable to accept electrons and is analogous to a conventional anaerobic reactor, 
fermentative anaerobes such as Clostridium  species were observed with other 
facultative aerobes belonging to genus  Pseudomonas . At moderate R ext (510 Ω), 
several organisms belonging to phyla such as Proteobacteria ( Pseudomonas 
protegens,  Pseudomonas plecoglossicida and Dickeya zeae ), Firmicutes 
(Pelotomaculum propionicicum ) and Bacteroidetes ( Dysgonomonas mossii ) were  
selected. At high R exts (10 kΩ), Proteobacteria belonging to genera such as 
Klebsiella , Pseudomonas  and Methylobacterium  were selected. Species belonging 
to the genus Klebsiella  are especially known for f ermentative growth (Cheng et al , 
2010) and therefore, the selection of Klebsiella sp. at high R exts could be reflective 
of the electron transfer limitations encountered by the anode organisms at high 
Rexts. The low anode potentials that prevail under high R exts tend to render the 
anode ineffective as a terminal electron acceptor (Jung  and Regan , 2011). These 
conditions may favour methanogenic microbial communities rather than exo -
electrogenic bacteria. Organisms belonging to the genus Methylobacterium  are 
known for their ability to utili se methane as the sole source of carbon and ener gy 
(Van Aken et al , 2004). The presence of methane oxidising bacteria such as 
Methylobacterium extorquens  could be indicative of high prevalence of methane 
generating prokaryotes at high R exts (10 kΩ). No spe cies belonging to phyla 
Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were identified at low R ext (10 Ω), whereas species 
belonging to phyla Actinobacteria ( Rhodococcus sp . and Actinomyces sp ) and 
Bacteriodetes ( Sphingomonas sp .) were identified. A previous study conducte d by 
Jung and Regan, (2011) found that when the MFCs were operated with an R ext 
close to their internal resistance and subsequently changed to a higher R ext, 170 
 significant microbial community shifts do occur. Whereas, decreasing the R ext 
below the R int does not significantly influence microbial community structures in 
acetate fed and glucose fed MFCs. To the contrary of the latter observation 
however, significant changes in microbial community at low R exts (10 Ω) from the 
microbial community at moderately low  Rext (510 Ω) wer e found in this study 
(Table  7.1 and Figure  7.5).  
7.2.5. The effect of exogenous addition of synthetic redox 
mediators on azo dye decolourisation in MFC anodes  
Synthetic and natural redox mediators such as AQDS, AQS and riboflavin are 
known to reversibly conduct reduction/oxidation reactions by carrying electrons 
between various chemical species. Reductive azo dye degradation by means of 
electron transfer on the azo moieties is an important starting step of any bacterial 
azo dye degrada tion strategy.  Therefore, it is important to investigate avenues to 
enhance the reductive degradation of azo dyes in order to avoid it becoming a 
rate-limiting factor in the process of azo dye biodegradation. Redox mediators are 
capable of lowering thermo dynamic limitations of electron transfer reactions and 
were reported in several previous studies to be capable of enhancing azo dye 
reductive degrada tion kinetics (Dos Santos et al , 2003, Dos Santos e t al, 2004, 
Rodriguez et al , 2012).

Figure 7.6: Cyclic voltammograms of AO -7 containing MFC anodes following the 
addition of synthetic redox mediators AQDS (solid line) and AQS (dashed line) 
indicating reversible oxidation -reduction peaks characteristic of redox mediatory 
role played by these compounds.  
 
Cyclic voltammograms of AQDS and AQS redox mediator containing MFC anodes 
indicate that these two compounds are indeed capable of ferrying electrons 
reversibly from and to  the anode electrode (Figure  7.6). This suggests that the two 
synthetic redox compo unds used in this study carry out oxidation/reduction 
reactions in a reversible manner. This further suggests that the presence of such 
synthetic electron  shuttling compounds would assist ferrying electrons to the azo 
moieties of various azo dyes if they w ere included in the MFC anode.  
In this view, the presence of compounds that are capable of ferrying electrons 
reversibly to azo moieties of various azo dyes would be beneficial in enhancing 
reductive degradation kinetics and faster attenuation of dyes from  synthetic 
wastewater. The two synthetic redox mediators AQDS and AQS were used in a 
range of concentration s in this study in order to investigate the possible azo dye 
degradation kinetic enhancements in microbial fuel cells. A portion of th e reducing 
equivalents released  as a result of oxidation of organic substrate (glucose in this 
study) will be diverted to reducing the azo moieties while the remainder of the 
172 
 reducing equivalents will be transferred to the anode by the exo -electrogenic 
bacteria  (assuming  that no other electron sinks are present in the anode medium) .

The thermodynamic barriers of electron transfer on to the azo moieties leading to 
their reductive degradation are expected to be lowered by the presence of the two 
redox mediators AQDS and AQS.

The enhancement of AO -7 decolourisation observed in this study as a result of the

decolourisation kinetic constants were significantly improved (p<0.05, ANOVA) 
compared to controls (no mediator) from 0.28 h-1 and 0.22 h-1 to 0.58 h-1 and 0.88 
h-1 (mediator concentration – 150 µM) respectively for AQDS and A QS (Figures

The relationship between the AO-7 decolourisation kinetic constant ( k) and the 
mediator concentration (in both experiments where AQDS or AQS were utilised) 
was not linear, but rather exhibited a saturation -type h yperbolic relationship 
(Figure  7.9). It is widely accepted that a reducti ve-oxidative sequential  
biodegradation approach is suitable for achieving full degradation of azo dyes in 
potential industr ial applications (O’Neill et al, 2000, Pandey et al , 2007). Therefore, 
avoiding kinetic limitations in the initial reductive degradation step of azo dyes is 
extremely important in order to circumvent any possible bottlenecks in the overall 
process. Therefore, when MFCs are considered for potential industrial or pilot 
scale azo dye removal applications, optimisation of the anode potential by means 
of optimising the R ext and exogenous addition of synthetic or natural electron 
shuttling compounds may assist in enhancing the overall efficiency of azo dye 
removal process.  175 
 7.3. Conclu ding remarks  
The outcome of the work indicates that  microbial fuel cell external resistance can 
be used as a potential tool for influencing azo dye reductive degradation kinetics. 
The influence of R ext on exo -electrogenic bacteria for optimum power production 
can be utilised to enhance the efficiency of re ductive degradation of azo moieties 
of various azo dye compounds. The choice of the external resistance for achieving 
optimum azo dye reductive degradation kinetics did not significantly deteriorate the 
effluent quality in terms of COD removal. Apart from influencing azo dye 
degradation kinetics and MFC power outputs, the variations in R ext significantly 
influenced the selection of significantly diverse microbial communities in the MFC 
anodes. Furthermore, exogenous supplementation of electron shuttling 
compounds could further enhance azo dye reductive decolourisation kinetics. 
Therefore, these approaches for azo dye reductive degradation kinetic 
enhancement could potentially be used in the initial stage of the reductive -
oxidative two -stage bioprocesses invo lving microbial fuel cells.

 177 
 The initial study (Chapter  3) utilising AO -7 as the model azo dye in two -chamber 
MFC anodes demonstrated that enhanced azo dye reductive degradation kinetics 
can be achieved by employing either S.oneidensis  pure cultures or mixed 
anaerobic microbial populations. At the four dye conc entrations tested (35 mg L-1, 
70 mgL-1, 195 mgL-1 and 350 mg L-1), colour removal efficiencies exceeding 98% 
were reached within 30 hours of MFC operation. The decolourisation kinetic 
constants ( k) indicated a concentration – dependant decrease from 0.709 ± 0.05 h-
1 to 0.05 ± 0.01h-1 when the azo dye concentration was raised from 35  mgL-1 to 
350 mg L-1. The two constituent amines formed during the decolourisation process 
were identified as sulfanilic acid ( 4-aminobenzenesulfonic acid ) and 1 -amino -2-
naphthol. It can be inferred from these results that when the amine degradation 
products were formed in increasing concentration (i.e. when high concentrations of 
AO-7 is introduced into MFC anodes), the decolourisation kinetic constants are 
adversely aff ected proba bly due to their toxic effects to the anode microorganisms. 
The Ames mutagenicity tests subsequently carried out using two Histidine 
auxotroph strains of S.typhimurium  confirmed that the mutagenic potential of the 
decolourisation products increase in a con centration – dependent manner. This 
clearly indicates that it is potentially dangerous to discharge reductively 
decolourised AO -7 contaminated wastewater into the environment due to its 
mutagenic potential  and toxicity . Simultaneous bioelectricity generati on was 
achieved during AO -7 reductive degradation at all dye concentrations. This study 
further demonstrated that cheaper and sustainable substrate types such as 
molasses and corn -steep liquor can be used as the electron donor for azo dye 
reductive degrada tion and concomitant bioelectricity generation in MFC anodes. 
Fast AO -7 reductive degradation kinetics achieved in this study holds promise for 
utilising MFC based systems as the initial step of a two -stage anaerobic -aerobic 
sequential treatment regimen fo r complete degradation of azo dyes. However, the 178 
 toxic and mutagenic amines generated in MFC anodes during AO -7 reductive 
degradation suggest that the decolourised effluent is not suitable to be released 
without further aerobic treatment.  
In the second st udy (Chapter  4), the reductive degradation of complex azo dye 
mixtures under industrially relevant conditions such as high salinities and high 
temperatures was investigated in two -chamber MFCs. Azo dye contaminated 
wastewater is more likely to contain many  different structurally different dye 
compounds and may also contain various auxiliary salts such as Na 2SO 4 and NaCl 
used during the dyeing process. Hence, it is imperative for any potential 
wastewater treatment system to be capable of effectively dealing with multiple azo 
dyes under industrially relevant conditions. A potential system would ideal ly be 
capable of operating utilising  cheap and sustainable electron donors such as 
molasses. The azo dye adapted mixed microbial consortium used in this study 
was capable of effective colour and organic load removal over 90% using 
molasses as the electron donor during MFC operation with concomitant 
bioelectricity generation (P max = 16  mWm-2). Thermophillic operation at 50°C 
allowed for enhanced performances in terms  of azo dye degradation kinetic 
constants ( k = 0.27h-1) and MFC bioelectricity generation (P max = 25.6  mWm-2) 
compared to mesophillic operation of MFCs at 30°C. Furthermore, the MFC 
systems were capable of effectively removing colour and COD at moderate 
salinities. The outcome of this study implies that MFC based systems could 
successfully be employed for effective colour and COD removal from complex azo 
dye mixtures. The microbial communities selected during azo dye degradation 
were distinctly different to  the microbial communities found in the original mixed 
bacterial population. It can be inferred that microbial community structure is 
markedly influenced by the presence of azo dyes in MFC anodes and this may 179 
 potentially play an important role in effective  degradation of complex azo dye 
mixtures by the azo dye adapted mixed bacterial population.  
In the third study  (Chapter  5), the possibility of complete degradation of the model 
azo dye AO -7 using an integrated MFC – aerobic sequential biotreatment process 
was investigated. Tubular mono -chamber MFCs operated in continuous mode fed 
with AO -7 containing synthetic wastewater medium was used in this study. The 
synthetic wastewater medium was supplemented with molasses to act as the 
electron donor for azo dye red uctive degradation and MFC operation and the 
reactor system was operated at ambient temperature. The synthetic wastewater 
medium did not include a buffering system but was instead adjusted with common 
colour industry wastewater auxiliary salts Na 2SO 4 and N aCl, in order to provide 
necessary ionic strength for MFC operation. Colour and soluble COD removal 
rates in excess of 90% in the final effluent were achieved even when the AO -7 
loading rates were  incrementally varied from 70 g m-3day-1 to 210 g m-3day-1. This 
suggests that the two -stage integrated bioreactor system is capable of effective 
colour and organics removal even at high azo dye loading rates. HPLC -MS 
analysis indicated that aminobenzene s were further degraded into simpler and non 
–toxic (determi ned using the V.fischeri  toxicity assessment procedure) metabolites 
at the end of the MFC -aerobic two -stage reactor operation. The two -stage system 
was capable of operating at ambient temperature, often encountering low 
temperatures and was capable of oper ating effectively for long operational periods 
(in excess of 150 days) in continuous mode. This highlights the robustness of such 
MFC -aerobic integrated reactor systems and therefore, would suit potential 
industrial scale colour industry wastewater treatme nt processes. Furthermore, the 
MFC stage was capable of continues bioelectricity production during azo dye 
degradation and therefore highlights the additional benefits of such systems in 180 
 terms of sustainable bioenergy production. Outcomes of this study imp lies that 
MFC based technologies in conjunction with existing wastewater treatment 
technologies such as activated sludge systems can effectively be used for colour 
industry wastewater treatment.  
In the penultimate study  (Chapter  6), an up -scaled version o f the MFC – aerobic 
two stage bioreactor system was used in order to treat real colour industry 
wastewater originating from acid dyebaths for wool colouring and leather tanning. 
The s ystem comprised of several mono -chamber MFC units acting in unison in 
continuous flow mode and had a working volume of 1.2  L. The MFC stage was 
hydraulically connected to a subsequent aerobic bioreactor stage (2  L working 
volume) mimicking an activated sludge system in order to achieve more complete 
degradation of colouring age nts found within colour industry wastewater used in 
the study. The individual MFC modules used in the scaled -up MFC system were 
connected in parallel configuration with the aim of attaining higher current 
densities. Colour and COD removal in the final effl uents when synthetic 
wastewater (containing AO -7 as the azo dye) was used, reached over 90% and 
85% respectively, suggesting that the scaled up two -stage reactor was in par in 
terms of performance with the smaller two - stage reactor used in the previous 
study. When both types of synthetic wastewater were used, colour and COD 
removal efficiencies of the final effluents exceeded 95% and 80% respectively. 
Current output (1150  mAm-2) of the parallel connected MFC modules was found to 
be an enhancement from sing le MFC modules (550  mAm-2), whereas the power 
densities remained relatively unchanged when the MFC modules were stacked in 
parallel configuration (54  mWm-2 from parallel stacked MFCs compared to 49  
mWm-2 from individual modules). Comparison of HPLC chromat ograms of dye 
contaminated influent wastewater and decolourised final effluent from the aerobic 181 
 stage suggested that numerous degradation products were formed during the two -
stage biotreatment process. It can be inferred from these findings that modular 
MFC scale -up could potentially be used in conjunction with other existing 
wastewater treatment technologies such as activated sludge systems for effective 
colour and organic removal from colour industry wastewater and concomitant 
bioelectricity generation.  
In the final study  (Chapter  7), the influence of applied external resistance (R ext) 
and exogenous addition of synthetic electron shuttling compounds  Anthraquinone -
2-sulfonic acid  (AQS) and Antharquinone -2,6-disulfonic acid (AQDS) on the 
decolourisation kin etics of three model azo dyes AO -7, Reactive red -3 (RR -3) and 
Direct yellow -106 (DY -106) was investigated in two -chamber MFCs. The R ext is 
known to significantly influence the anode potential and hence, the metabolism of 
the microbial populations residing  in the MFC anode. The reductive 
decolourisation kinetic constants ( k) of all three tested azo dyes in MFC anodes 
were found to be enhanced at moderate R exts, whereas application of extremely 
low (10  Ω) and extremely high (46  kΩ) R exts considerably hindere d decolourisation 
kinetic constants of all three model dyes. Microbial community dynamic studies 
indicated that microbial populations being selected under different R exts were 
markedly different. Maximum power densities obtained from the two chamber 
system s during dye degradation were also found to be higher when moderate R exts 
were used, as opposed to extreme high or extreme low R exts. This suggests that 
application of moderate R exts (between 500  Ω to 2.2  kΩ in this study) would 
enhance the selection of exo-electrogenic bacteria, whereas the application of 
extremes of R exts would promote mostly the selection of fermentative 
microorganisms, eventually leading to a deterioration of azo dye reductive 
degradation kinetics and MFC power outputs. The addition o f synthetic electron 182 
 shuttling compounds such as AQDS and AQS enhanced k values of AO -7 
reductive degradation in a concentration -dependant manner. However, at very 
high mediator concentrations (150  µM), the k values indicated a saturation -type 
non-linear r elationship in relation to the mediator concentration. The outcomes of 
this work demonstrates that R ext and the exogenous supplementation of electron 
shuttling compounds are capable of influencing azo dye reductive degradation 
kinetics in MFC based colour industry wastewater treatment systems.

 The final outcome of this research underscores several areas of potential further 
study. These may allow further optimisation and improvement of the developed 
bioelectrochemical systems for colour industry wastewater treatment.  
9.1. Development of biocath odes for colour 
industry wastewater treatment  
When two -chamber bioelectrochemical systems are considered, biocathodes are 
an exciting new prospect in terms sustainability of BES and cost reduction of using 
abiotic cathode catalysts (i.e. precious metal cat alysts). The use of biocathodes 
eliminates the need for the use of precious metals such as platinum in  MFC 
cathodes (He and Angenent , 2006). Many previous studies demonstrated the 
potential of biocathodes utilising various microorganisms as the cathode cat alyst 
for the cathodic oxygen reduction re action in MFCs (Clauwaert et al, 2007, Freguia 
et al, 2010, L efebvre et al, 2008, You et al , 2009). The outcomes of current work 
demonstrated that in order to achieve complete biodegradation of azo dyes in 
colour i ndustry wastewater by MFC based systems utilising various types of 
bacteria, a two stage sequential strategy comprising of reductive and oxidative 
degradation steps is necessary. Therefore, if these reductive and oxidative stages 
are to be combined in a tw o-chamber MFC system, the utilisation of a biocathode 
would be the ideal strategy for the final oxidative degradation step. The colourless 
but toxic amines generated in the reductive degradation step in MFC anode would 
be fed into the biocathodes where the  amines would undergo further degradation 
oxidatively in the biocathode. Very few previous studies investigated this possibility 
of using biocathodes of BES for the treatment of aminobenzene s generated from 
azo dye r eductive degradation (Hou et al, 2012, L iu et al, 2009, Sun et al, 2011, 
Wang et al , 2013). Therefore, additional work could be carried out in this area in 185 
 order to investigate the possibility of utilising biocathodes for the purpose of 
efficient degradation and detoxification of azo dyes and th eir harmful 
transformation products and for simultaneous bioelectricity generation.  
9.2. The use of enzymes as the cathode catalyst in 
MFCs for simultaneous azo dye degradation and 
bioelectricity generation  
The use of peroxidese and phenol oxidase enzymes  for the purpose of dye 
degradation including azo dyes is well documented in previous resea rch (Kwang -
Soo and Chang -Jin, 1998, Chivukula and Renganathan , 1995, Spadaro and 
Ranganathan, 1994). Phenol oxidase enzymes such as laccases and many other 
peroxidas es possess high redox potentials (Xu et al , 1996). Therefore, they could 
be used for the purpose of electron abstraction from the cathode and subsequent 
reduction of oxygen to water in the cathodic compartment in MFCs.  
4e- + 4H+ + O 2 → 2H2O 
This has been demonstrated in several previous studies where the noble metal 
catalyst cathode was replaced by a laccase catalysed cathode in MFCs (Schaetz le 
et al, 2009, Szczupak et al , 2012). Considering the ability of phenol oxidases such 
as laccases to non-specifically degrade dye compounds such as azo dyes, these 
enzymes could potentially be utilised in MFC cathodes in the twin -role of 
degrading azo compounds as well as carrying out the vital oxygen reduction 
reaction without the assistance of any noble  metal catalyst. Furthermore, enzyme 
immobilisation on electrode surfaces could enhance the catalytic efficiency and the 
longevity of the active form of the enzyme than when suspended in solution. 
Hence the use of laccase, other phenol oxidases and peroxid ase enzymes as the 186 
 cathode catalysts in MFCs and dye degrading agents in biocathodes would be an 
exciting area of further study.  
9.3. Integrating advanced oxidation processes 
(AOP) with MFCs for complete azo dye degradation  
Many AOP based processes have p reviously been studied and demonstrated to 
possess the capability to degrade dye compounds. The use of MFC’s for in-situ 
generation of H 2O2 and hydroxyl radical has been demonstrated in  a few recent 
studies (Fu et al, 2010, Liu et al, 2011, Zhu and Logan , 2013). In-situ generation of 
Fenton’s reagent or hydroxyl radicals holds great potential for degradation and 
detoxification of dye compounds and their biological transformation products such 
as aminobenzene s. Controlling the cathode half -cell potential to around 600 mV in 
two chamber MFCs would lead to the generation of H 2O2 in the catholyte. When 
combined with a suitable source of Fe3+ in the catholyte, in-situ generation of the 
Fenton’s reagent at the cath ode end of MFCs can be achieved for wastewater 
treatment purposes. Hence, more research into MFC/AOP integrated systems 
would be beneficial in view of developing bioelectrochemical systems that are 
capable of effectively dealing with colour industry wastew ater. 
 
 
 
 
 187 
 9.4. Incorporating molecular and synthetic biology 
approaches for engineering microbes tha t are 
better capable of extracellular  electron transfer  
Engineering microbes that are capable of efficient extracellular electron transfer is 
considered as an attractive and novel way of enhancing the performance of BES 
including MFCs. It could also be expected that employing such microbes with 
enhanced capabilities of extracellular  electron transfer (EET) could also be 
bene ficial in reductive degradation of various azo dye pollutants. In this view, the 
heterologous expression of proteins that are thought to be involved in external 
electron transfer in hosts such as Escherichia coli seems very attractive. 
Particularly, the me mbrane -bound cytochromes such as Mtr, Cym and Omc 
proteins that are demonstrated to be linked to extracellular electron transfer in 
hosts such as E.coli confers several benefits. Firstly, high rates of EET  could be 
achieved when rapid growth rates of organ isms such as E.coli are modified to 
express fully functional EET related proteins. Secondly, the heterologous 
expression of such proteins in hosts such as E.coli would be more convenient 
because a highly developed molecular toolkit is already available for  genetically 
manipulating organisms such as E.coli . Hitherto, only a few reports of published 
work can be found relating to heterologous expression of EET proteins in E.coli . 
Many of the EET proteins that were heterologously expressed were S.oneidensis 
cytochromes such as MtrA (Pitts et al, 2003), CymA (Gescher et al, 2008) and 
OmcA (Donald et al , 2008). All of these EET genes that were heterologously 
expressed in E.coli  were demonstrated to be functional and were shown to reduce 
electron acceptors such as Fe3+ and other insoluble electron acceptors such as 
poised electrodes . Hence, this suggests that heterologous expression of one or 188 
 several EET capable genes in hosts su ch as E.coli  would be beneficial in 
improving electrochemical performance in BES including MFCs.
