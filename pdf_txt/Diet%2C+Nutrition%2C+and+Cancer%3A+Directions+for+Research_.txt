NIH NUTRITION RESEARCH REPORT 2020 –2021
1 NIH NUTRITION RESEARCH REPORT 2020 –2021I. Executive Summary 
The mission of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living 
systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. NIH supports 
and conducts a broad array of transformative and impactful research studies to better understand nutrition and how it relates 
to human health and disease. This research focuses on understanding how nutrients and food components are ingested, 
digested, absorbed, metabolized, stored, and excreted and their overall impact on the body. It also includes research studies to 
better understand the effects of behavior, including eating and food choice, and environmental exposures on nutritional status.
The NIH Nutrition Research Report summarizes nutrition research activities supported and conducted by NIH in Fiscal Years 
2020 (FY20) and 2021 (FY21). This report was compiled and produced by the NIH Office of Nutrition Research  (ONR), which is 
located in the Division of Program Coordination, Planning, and Strategic Initiatives in the NIH Office of the Director. ONR leads 
NIH-wide strategic planning and development of nutrition research initiatives.
NIH’s total investment in nutrition-related research was approximately $2.0 billion in FY20 and $2.1 billion in FY21. Nutrition 
research funding increased by approximately $510 million—a 25 percent overall increase—from FY14 to FY21 (Source: 
Categorical Spending—Nutrition, NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools (RePORT) . Approximately half of the nutrition-
related projects in FY20 and FY21 were related to prevention or obesity.
NIH-supported nutrition research has led to several important discoveries. Many of these findings are announced in NIH  
News Releases  or published in  NIH R esearc h Matters , a biweekly update of NIH research highlights from the NIH Office of 
Communications and Public Liaison. Highlights related to nutrition from FY20 to FY21 include the following:
 ▶ A high-fiber diet may improve the response of melanoma patients to immunotherapy : A study led by researchers at the 
National Cancer Institute’s Center for Cancer Research found that a diet rich in fiber may help some patients being treated for 
melanoma respond to immunotherapy treatment by influencing the gut microbiome.
 ▶ NIH scientists identify a nutrient that helps prevent bacterial infection : Scientists from five institutes at NIH studied the body’s 
natural defenses against bacterial infection and identified a nutrient—taurine—that helps the gut recall prior infections and 
kill invading bacteria. This discovery could aid efforts to find alternatives to antibiotic treatment.
Nutrition-related scientific meetings, workshops, and symposia play a key role in the advancement of nutrition science by 
providing an opportunity to identify critical research gaps and scientific priorities, as well as disseminate research findings to 
the scientific community and the public. During FY20 and FY21, NIH sponsored several nutrition-related events, including the 
following:
 ▶ Precision Nutrition: Research Gaps and Opportunities Workshop
 ▶ Food Insecurity, Neighborhood Food Environment, and Nutrition Health Disparities: State of the Science Workshop
 ▶ Conflicting and Controversial Health Information in the Media: Content, Exposure, and Effects
NIH- and governmentwide collaborations and public–private partnerships were critical to the development of nutrition-
related research, strategic planning, and technology transfer initiatives during FY20 and FY21. These collaborations are critical 
to effectively utilize resources and harmonize the federal nutrition research agenda. Examples of such collaborations include 
the Interagency Committee on Human Nutrition Research, the National Collaborative on Childhood Obesity Research, and the 
NIH Nutrition Research Coordinating Committee.
NIH is committed to fostering innovative research and training to advance the field of nutritional science, with the goal of 
promoting and improving health. Each NIH institute, center, and office (ICO) plays an integral role in accomplishing this 
mission, and each has shared its research directions as they pertain to nutrition. This comprehensive report serves to be 
informative and to stimulate new ideas and discoveries.2
NIH NUTRITION RESEARCH REPORT 2020 –2021II. Introduction
The National Institutes of Health (NIH), part of the U.S. Department of Health 
and Human Services (HHS), is the nation’s medical research agency. NIH is 
made up of 27 institutes and centers (ICs), each with a research agenda that 
often focuses on specific diseases or body systems. NIH supports biomedical 
and behavioral research and training in nutrition as it relates to human 
development, health maintenance, disease prevention, and disease treatment.
Nutrition is a factor in many diseases and an integral part of overall health, 
development, and well-being. As a result, research interests in the nutritional 
sciences extend far beyond those of a single institute. Biomedical and 
behavioral nutrition research and training in FY20 and FY21 was supported by 
24 NIH ICs and the NIH Office of the Director.
The NIH nutrition research portfolio includes extramural and intramural research as well as research training. In FY21, 81 percent 
of the nutrition research portfolio was extramural research, conducted by hundreds of institutions in the United States and in 
several countries across the world. Many of the research projects funded by NIH are based on ideas developed by individual 
investigators from institutions of higher education, independent hospitals, and other research organizations. Most of the 
intramural research was performed in laboratories on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland—including the Clinical Center. NIH 
also has research facilities throughout the country.

NIH NUTRITION RESEARCH REPORT 2020 –2021III. Office of Nutrition Research 
Over the past several years, NIH has been bolstering nutrition research because of the role that nutrition plays in health and 
disease. In 2015, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), one of 27 NIH ICs, established the 
Office of Nutrition Research  (ONR) to accelerate progress in nutrition research. In May 2020, NIH announced  its first agencywide 
2020-2030 Strategic Plan for NIH Nutrition Research , with the goal of further advancing this area of science and addressing diet-
related diseases across the lifespan. It emphasizes cross-cutting, innovative opportunities for advancing nutrition research across 
a wide range of areas, from basic science to experimental design to research training. The plan is organized around a unifying 
vision of precision nutrition research and includes four strategic goals and five cross-cutting research areas. These opportunities 
complement and enhance ongoing research efforts across NIH to improve health and to prevent or combat diseases and 
conditions affected by nutrition.
Given the importance of nutrition research to human health and disease, on January 8, 2021, then–NIH Director Francis S. Collins, 
M.D., Ph.D., announced that ONR would be transferred from NIDDK to the Division of Program Coordination, Planning, and 
Strategic Initiatives (DPCPSI) within the NIH Office of the Director. DPCPSI has a statutory mandate to identify emerging scientific 
opportunities, rising public health challenges, and existing knowledge gaps that deserve special emphasis and would benefit from 
strategic coordination and planning. Nutrition research is aligned with the scope of this mandate. Prior to that announcement, 
NIH sought public comment on the proposed transfer of ONR from NIDDK to DPCPSI via a Federal Register notice  in December 
2020. The response from the public and the nutrition research community was overwhelmingly supportive. This transfer to 
DPCPSI was also supported by the Council of Councils, an NIH advisory group, during a special meeting on December 30, 2020 .
The mission of ONR is to advance nutrition science to promote health and to reduce the burden of diet-related diseases and 
nutrition health disparities. To this end, ONR—
 ▶ Coordinates implementation of the 2020–2030 Strategic Plan for NIH Nutrition Research  and evaluates progress toward its 
goals, objectives, and crosscutting research areas
 ▶ Identifies research projects that deserve expanded effort and support from NIH ICs
 ▶ Develops, leads, and manages NIH-wide nutrition research projects in collaboration with the ICs
 ▶ Represents NIH on intradepartmental or interagency committees on nutrition research and related policy issues
 ▶ Advises NIH leadership and other key officials on matters relating to research on nutrition

NIH NUTRITION RESEARCH REPORT 2020 –2021OVERVIEW
NIH is the leader in federally supported nutrition research and training. In FY19, FY20, and FY21, NIH provided a total of $1.9, $2.0, 
and $2.1 billion, respectively, toward these efforts. These amounts represent the combined individual contributions of 24 NIH ICs 
and the NIH Office of the Director. In FY21, NIH funded nutrition research in 50 states, the District of Columbia, two U.S. territories, 
and 19 foreign countries. NIH supported approximately 2,000 nutrition-related clinical studies in FY21.
NIH NUTRITION RESEARCH REPORTING
The FY20 and FY21 nutrition research and training information 
in this report—including grants, contracts, and other 
funding mechanisms—was obtained using the NIH Research 
Portfolio Online Reporting Tools ( RePORT ) and NIH RePORT 
Expenditures and Results ( RePORTER ) systems, which are publicly available open-source databases. Additional 
information about these databases, as well as the methodology 
for how the data within this report were obtained, are both 
available in Section X .
NUTRITION RESEARCH AND TRAINING EXPENDITURES
Trends: Fiscal Years 2019–2021
As a percentage of total NIH spending, nutrition research 
funding has been stable at approximately 5 percent since FY15 . 
Table 1  shows total NIH nutrition research and training support 
in current and constant dollars. Actual obligations for nutrition 
research and training by the ICs for FY19–FY21 are shown in 
Table 2 . NIH nutrition research funding increased by almost 
$135 million (7 percent) from FY19 to FY21, but the increase was 
not a uniform trend across individual ICs.The most recent nutrition research and training expenditures 
for the ICs in FY21 are shown in Table 3  as total funding 
amounts and percentages of their total obligation. The number 
of projects at each IC that supports nutrition research is also 
included.IV. NIH Nutrition Research and Funding

NIH NUTRITION RESEARCH REPORT 2020 –2021SPENDING CATEGORIES 
NIH research projects may meet the criteria of multiple 
fingerprints, and most nutrition projects are categorized  
under other spending categories, as well as nutrition.  
Figure 1  shows the spending categories that appear most 
frequently in projects categorized as nutrition. Approximately half of the nutrition projects funded in FY19–FY21 also were 
categorized as prevention, and nearly half were categorized as 
obesity or clinical research.
Figure 1. Overlapping Spending Categories as a Percentage of Total Projects, Fiscal Years 2019–2021 (FY19–FY21)
FUNDING MECHANISM
Figure 2  shows the percentage of FY19–FY21 nutrition funding 
by research mechanism. Extramural and intramural projects 
comprised 90 percent of the NIH nutrition research portfolio in 
FY21. Within the extramural category, research project grants 
comprised the largest category of support.
NIH supports training in biomedical and behavioral nutrition 
research primarily through two extramural mechanisms: 
institutional awards and individual awards. The institutional awards, commonly called “training grants,” are designed to 
enable institutions to offer training awards to individuals they 
select for predoctoral and postdoctoral research training. The 
predoctoral and postdoctoral individual awards are offered as 
fellowships or career awards to provide research training to 
individuals to broaden their scientific background and extend 
their potential for conducting research.

NIH NUTRITION RESEARCH REPORT 2020 –2021NIH-supported nutrition research led to important discoveries in FY20  and FY21. Many of these discoveries were announced 
in an NIH News Release or published in NIH Research Matters. The list below includes a sample of research highlights; a more 
comprehensive list of NIH nutrition-related press releases and  NIH Research Matters  articles can be found in  Table 4 .
HIGHLIGHTS FROM NIH NEWS RELEASES AND NIH RESEARCH MATTERS
Cancer Treatment
For patients with cancers that do not respond to 
immunotherapy drugs, adjusting the composition of 
microorganisms in the intestines—known as the gut 
microbiome—using stool or fecal transplants may help some 
of these individuals respond to the immunotherapy drugs, a 
new study suggests. In an NCI-supported study, some patients 
with advanced melanoma who initially did not respond to 
treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, a type of 
immunotherapy, did respond to the drug after receiving 
a transplant of fecal microbiota from a patient who had 
responded to the drug. Read more .Diet and Exercise
An NIDDK -supported study found that mice with high blood 
sugar levels had lower gains from aerobic exercise than normal 
mice. These results suggest that diet changes may be needed to 
help people get the most benefit from aerobic exercise.

Infectious Diseases
Scientists studying the body’s natural defenses against 
bacterial infection have identified a nutrient—taurine—
that helps the gut recall prior infections and kill invading 
bacteria. The NIH study found that taurine given to mice as a 
supplement in drinking water also prepared the microbiota to 
prevent infection. Read more .V. NIH Nutrition Research News

NIH NUTRITION RESEARCH REPORT 2020 –2021VII. Nutrition Practicums 
Several ICs offer practicums with the goal of expanding specific research interests. Both NCI and the NIH Office of Dietary  
Supplements (ODS)  offer annual nutrition-related research practicums. These practicums are open to the public at no charge but 
require an application.
JOHN MILNER NUTRITION AND CANCER PREVENTION RESEARCH PRACTICUM
NIH and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) offer a 
one-week educational opportunity in nutrition and cancer 
prevention research, the John Milner Nutrition and Cancer  
Prevention Research Practicum , for individuals with a 
sustained commitment to nutrition and health promotion.
Offered since 2004, this intense learning session provides 
specialized instruction on the role of diet and bioactive food 
components as modifiers of cancer incidence and tumor 
behavior and engages participants through didactic and 
interactive experiences. The practicum is not intended to 
enhance patient education or clinical practice; rather,  
it is research-based and best suited for those interested in 
expanding their research.The practicum is open—at no cost—to graduate students; 
registered dietitian nutritionists; students enrolled in an 
Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics–
accredited, supervised-practice program or combined 
with graduate studies; and nongovernment academicians, 
physicians, and other health care professionals in the early 
stage of their career. Preference is given to individuals 
with relevant experience in nutrition and cancer research. 
International applicants are welcome. Those who have 
previously participated in the practicum are not eligible. A full-
week commitment from the participant is required.
MARY FRANCES PICCIANO DIETARY SUPPLEMENT RESEARCH PRACTICUM
The Mary Frances Picciano Dietary Supplement Research  
Practicum  is an annual two-and-a-half-day educational 
opportunity offered by the ODS that provides fundamental 
knowledge of dietary supplements. This intensive practicum 
provides a thorough overview and foundation of issues, 
concepts, unknowns, and controversies about dietary 
supplements and supplement ingredients. It also emphasizes 
the importance of scientific investigations to evaluate 
the efficacy, safety, and value of these products for health 
promotion and disease prevention, as well as how to conduct 
this type of research.This practicum is open—at no cost—to selected faculty, 
graduate students, and research practitioners in such health-
related disciplines as nutrition, food science, pharmacy, 
pharmacology and pharmacognosy, exercise science and 
kinesiology, medicine, dentistry, nursing, and complementary 
and alternative medicine. Preference will be given to candidates 
who are full-time academic faculty, research practitioners, 
doctoral students, postdoctoral students, and fellows. 
Applications also will be accepted from health care providers 
and scientists with a master’s degree or higher whose work 
involves research with dietary supplements, master’s-level 
students, and students in allied health schools. The practicum 
is limited to approximately 100 attendees per session.13
NIH NUTRITION RESEARCH REPORT 2020 –2021VIII. Nutrition-Related NIH-Wide Committees 
and Working Groups 
Several groups are engaged in collaborative nutrition-related activities at NIH. These activities facilitate the sharing ofresources 
and expertise, and they foster communication and opportunities for collaboration within the NIH nutrition science community. 
Key groups with representation from across NIH are listed and described below.
STRATEGIC PLAN FOR NIH NUTRITION RESEARCH IMPLEMENTATION WORKING GROUPS
The NIH Nutrition Research Implementation Working Groups 
(IWGs) are assisting ONR and NIH in implementing the 2020–2030 Strategic Plan for NIH Nutrition Research  and are 
organized around the following topic areas.
Foundational Nutrition Science
This working group focuses on basic, translational, and 
methodological foundational research in nutrition science. 
Recent topics of discussion include bioinformatic gaps in 
nutrition-related pathways, genes (e.g., transporter genes), and metabolites; meal-timing strategies for improving health, 
including circadian influences on nutrition and health; and the 
influence of nutrition on immune function.
Nutrition and Health Disparities
This working group seeks to advance NIH research to better 
understand the interactions between diet, nutritional status, 
the environment, and biological and behavioral processes, and 
how they contribute to health disparities. It will also encourage 
research on how to prevent and treat nutrition-related diseases 
and reduce health inequities. Because “nutrition and health 
disparities” is a cross-cutting theme of the Strategic Plan for Nutrition Research, the working group will collaborate with 
the other IWGs to support nutrition and health disparities 
research. These activities will stimulate the development of 
research priorities that elucidate how diversity of all kinds—
race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, disability, sex, gender, 
gender identity, and geography—influences nutrition and 
health interrelationships.
Microbiome, Diet, and Health Interrelationships
The main goal of this working group is to coordinate and 
promote research on diet-microbiome host interactions. 
This working group is represented by intramural and 
extramural NIH scientists with interest in microbiome–host 
interactions across the lifespan and in relation to disease 
and treatment. This group aspires to advance a precision nutrition research agenda by better defining diet–microbiome 
host interrelationships, and by aligning with the trans-NIH 
microbiome working group and fostering collaborative 
interactions. Some of the planned activities for the group 
include facilitating funding initiatives, organizing workshops 
and seminar series, and performing grant portfolio analysis.
Nutrition Across the Lifespan
This working group will advance research to define the role of 
nutrition to optimize health and prevent disease across the 
lifespan. The group comprises program staff from multiple 
NIH ICOs with expertise in the impact of nutrition on health, 
development, and disease from the periconceptional and 
prenatal timepoints to old age. Recognizing that each phase 
across the lifespan has unique research needs (i.e., pregnancy, 
infancy and early toddlerhood, adolescence, young and middle-aged adults, and older adulthood), the group will 
promote research on understudied time windows as well as 
research to better understand how nutritional needs and 
eating behaviors change throughout the lifespan to provide 
an evidence base for dietary intake recommendations to 
promote appropriate growth and development, health, disease 
prevention, and improved disease outcomes.
Implementation of Nutrition-Related Programs, Practices, and Behaviors
This working group seeks to advance the reach of effective 
nutrition and diet-related behavior interventions through 
implementation and dissemination science. The working group 
will promote initiation and sustainability of healthy eating 
behaviors by emphasizing multilevel (e.g., policy, community, family, and individual) approaches to bring precision nutrition 
interventions to scale through innovative research methods. 
Additional focus will be placed on extending research and 
practice capacity and evaluation of policies and programs to 
improve dietary quality.14
NIH NUTRITION RESEARCH REPORT 2020 –2021Approaches, Methods, and Tools for Dietary Intake Assessment
Achieving the goal of precision nutrition hinges on changing 
the way people think about diet, toward a holistic view that 
considers and analyzes dietary patterns, rather than individual 
nutrients. This working group seeks to advance the science of 
dietary assessment, with a goal of developing accurate, user-
friendly, and customizable dietary intake data-capture tools. These approaches include mobile devices, as well as innovative 
biomarkers of dietary intake and exposure. Additional priorities 
include strategies to combine data from multiple methods of 
dietary-intake assessment; integrate data sets with nutrient-
composition databases; and develop and disseminate statistical 
approaches to mitigate the effect of measurement error.
Medical Nutrition
This working group will focus on research aimed at expanding 
knowledge about the role of nutrition in disease treatment to 
address how the use of “Food is Medicine” can be improved 
in clinical settings. The ultimate goal is to enhance the ability of clinicians and the public to have evidence-based “medical 
foods,” medical nutrition therapy, or specific eating patterns 
that may help to prevent or reverse chronic diseases or to 
improve the effectiveness of medical treatments.
STRATEGIC PLAN FOR NIH NUTRITION RESEARCH: COMMITTEE SUPPORT 
The NIH Nutrition Research Report received additional input and support from the following NIH-wide committees.
Nutrition Research Coordinating Committee 
The NIH Nutrition Research Coordinating Committee (NRCC)  
was established in 1975 for the primary purpose of reviewing, 
discussing, and stimulating support for nutrition research and 
training within NIH. Today, the NRCC is a vibrant group whose 
membership includes representatives and interested staff from 
NIH ICOs and other federal agencies. The NRCC is chaired by 
the ONR Director. NRCC meetings occur monthly and typically include scientific seminars, nutrition research program and 
policy updates, information about research interests, and 
collaborative project activities. Additionally, a subcommittee of 
the NRCC, the NIH Nutrition Education Subcommittee , reviews 
federal nutrition education materials that contain dietary 
guidance for the general population.
Obesity Research Task Force
The NIH Obesity Research Task Force (ORTF)  was formed 
to provide the research community a platform to exchange 
information on a broad spectrum of NIH-sponsored obesity-
related research, including molecular, genetic, behavioral, 
environmental, clinical, and epidemiologic studies. The ORTF is co-chaired by the Directors of NIDDK; the National Heart, Lung, 
and Blood Institute (NHLBI); and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver 
National Institute of Child Health and Human Development 
(NICHD). Members of the ORTF include representatives from 
these and many other NIH institutes and centers.
Coordinating Committee on Research on Women’s Health
NIH IC Directors or their designees comprise the NIH 
Coordinating Committee on Research on Women’s Health 
(CCRWH). As established by legislative mandate in the NIH 
Revitalization Act of 1993, CCRWH members  serve as direct 
liaisons between the NIH Office of Research on Women’s 
Health (ORWH) and NIH ICs. The CCRWH provides valuable 
guidance, collaboration, and support to ORWH program goals, 
including ORWH’s career development programs and outreach 
efforts.Specific CCRWH support involves—
 ▶ Serving as a resource for women’s health activities across 
the NIH
 ▶ Supporting methods to gather data by age and ethnic/racial 
groups of women’s participation in clinical trials
 ▶ Supporting the development and expansion of clinical trials 
necessary to the health of women
 ▶ Encouraging and supporting research on women’s health
 ▶ Identifying needs regarding the coordination of 
research activities, including intramural and extramural 
multidisciplinary activities15
NIH NUTRITION RESEARCH REPORT 2020 –2021HIV/AIDS Executive Committee
The NIH HIV/AIDS Executive Committee (NAEC)  is the 
coordinating committee for all NIH HIV/AIDS research and 
provides recommendations to the Director of the Office 
of AIDS Research (OAR) regarding the development and 
implementation of HIV/AIDS research programs and funding 
priorities in accordance with the NIH Strategic Plan for HIV  and HIV-Related Research . The NAEC also facilitates inter 
and intra-agency communication among the OAR and ICO to 
coordinate program initiatives and assists in the development 
of NIH-wide HIV/AIDS research plans, policies, and procedures. 
NAEC membership primarily includes a designated HIV/AIDS 
Coordinator from each ICO with an HIV/AIDS research budget.
Prevention Research Coordinating Committee
The Prevention Research Coordinating Committee (PRCC)  is 
an NIH-wide committee that provides a forum for NIH ICs 
and other federal partners to exchange programmatic and 
scientific information on prevention research activities that 
are sponsored by federal agencies and other organizations. The NIH Office of Disease Prevention (ODP) coordinates the 
Committee’s activities. The PRCC advises the ODP Director 
and provides recommendations regarding scientific, 
programmatic, and policy issues related to health promotion 
and disease prevention.
Trans-NIH Microbiome Working Group
The Trans-NIH Microbiome Working Group (TMWG)  was 
established in 2012 to provide a forum for coordinating 
NIH extramural research activities related to the human 
microbiome. TMWG membership is open to all extramural 
program staff from ICs with an interest in the human 
microbiome. TMWG meetings occur monthly.16
NIH NUTRITION RESEARCH REPORT 2020 –2021IX. Key Federal Collaborations 
Interagency collaboration enhances the field of nutrition. Highlighted below are ongoing collaborative efforts.
DIETARY GUIDELINES FOR AMERICANS 
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans are the foundation of 
federal food and nutrition programs, policies, and education 
initiatives. The  Dietary Guidelines are jointly issued by the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services (HHS) every 5 years, as required by 
law. The Dietary Guidelines are informed by a scientific report 
prepared by a federal advisory committee and comments 
received from federal agencies, industry, organizations, and 
consumers. The most current version is the  2020–2025 Dietary  
Guidelines for Americans .
USDA and HHS identified topics and scientific questions to be 
examined by the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee 
prior to establishing the Committee. The Departments added this step to promote a deliberate and transparent process, 
respond to feedback on the Dietary Guidelines development 
process, identify expertise needed on the Committee, help 
manage resources, and ensure the scientific review conducted 
by the Committee addresses federal nutrition policy and 
program needs.
USDA and HHS requested public nominations to the 2020 
Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee from September 6 to 
October 6, 2018. Twenty nationally recognized scientists were 
appointed to serve on the Committee in February 2019. The 
Committee’s work ended with the release of its scientific report 
to the secretaries of USDA and HHS. The two agencies then 
worked together to develop the  2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines.
DIETARY REFERENCE INTAKES
Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs)  are nutrient reference values 
developed by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, 
and Medicine (NASEM). The DRIs are intended to serve as a 
guide for nutritional intake and provide the scientific basis for 
the development of food guidelines in the United States and 
Canada. These nutrient reference values are specified based 
on age, gender, and life stage and cover more than 40 nutrient 
substances.
Government coordination of DRI-related activities is a joint 
effort between representatives of the U.S. and Canadian governments. The U.S.–Canada Joint DRI Working Group and 
the Interagency Committee on Human Nutrition Research 
(ICHNR) Subcommittee on Dietary Reference Intakes work 
together to develop an efficient process that ensures DRI values 
continue to be scientifically sound, current, and useful for 
public health purposes. This includes identifying DRI needs 
and prioritizing nutrient reviews, advancing work to resolve 
methodology issues, and coordinating funding for new DRI 
reviews.
DIETARY SUPPLEMENT INGREDIENT DATABASE
The Dietary Supplements Ingredient Database (DSID)  contains 
analytical data on dietary supplement product ingredients. The 
DSID was developed by the USDA Methods and Application of  
Food Composition Laboratory  in collaboration with the NIH 
ODS and other federal agencies. The goals of the DSID project 
are to establish reliable, analytically predicted estimates of ingredient content in dietary supplement products; compare 
analyzed levels of ingredients to labeled values provided 
by manufacturers, if available; and improve dietary intake 
assessments by providing data files and online calculators that 
adjust label values into analytically predicted amounts. 
DIETARY SUPPLEMENT LABEL DATABASE
The Dietary Supplement Label Database (DSLD)  is a joint effort 
between the National Library of Medicine and ODS, with input 
from many federal stakeholders. The database contains the full label contents from a sample of dietary supplement products 
marketed in the United States with a web-based user interface 
that provides access to label information.
FEDERAL DATA CONSORTIUM ON PREGNANCY AND BIRTH TO 24 MONTHS 
The Federal Data Consortium (Data Consortium) on Pregnancy 
and Birth to 24 Months (P/B-24) is a federal forum for sharing 
information and finding solutions to resolve crucial needs for 
data on P/B-24 populations to inform public health initiatives. The Data Consortium facilitates the ability of federal agencies 
to gather and review input to inform projects and research 
plans and share information on data availability and usage. 
More than a dozen federal agencies have funded projects 17
NIH NUTRITION RESEARCH REPORT 2020 –2021coordinated by the Data Consortium that are focused on filling 
critical gaps in scientific knowledge to support evidence-based 
programs, policies, and educational initiatives across the 
government and non-government sectors. The collaboration 
spans 185 federal staff and leaders from 30 agencies in five 
departments: HHS, USDA, the U.S. Agency for International 
Development (USAID), U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), 
and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The Data 
Consortium is co-led by representatives of NIH, the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), HHS Office of Disease 
Prevention and Health Promotion (ODPHP), U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA), USDA Agricultural Research Service 
(ARS), and USDA Food and Nutrition Service.The Data Consortium resulted from efforts by ODPHP within 
the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health in 2016 to 
coordinate “special studies” from CDC’s National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to fill crucial needs 
for data on P/B-24 populations to support future Dietary 
Guidelines for Americans . These data go beyond the needs of 
the Dietary Guidelines. Initiatives include The Human Milk 
Composition Initiative and B-24 questionnaire content in the 
NHANES Diet and Behavior Questionnaire .
FEDERAL WORKING GROUP ON DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS
The Federal Working Group on Dietary Supplements (FWGoDS)  
is led by the ODS and includes representatives from other NIH 
ICOs and other federal agencies. The FWGoDS provides an 
opportunity to strengthen collaborative efforts and to share 
information and discuss issues, initiatives, and research related to dietary supplements. The FWGoDS was established, in part, 
in response to a congressional mandate that ODS serve as an 
advisor to federal health agencies on issues related to dietary 
supplements. The FWDoDS has met twice a year since 2005.
FDA–NIH JOINT AGENCY ON NUTRITION WORKING GROUP
The FDA–NIH Joint Agency on Nutrition Working Group, a 
subgroup of the NIH –FDA Joint Leadership Council, was formed 
in 2016 to facilitate high-quality nutrition research to improve 
public health outcomes across the lifespan to reduce the risk factors for and incidence of nutrition-related chronic disease 
and inform nutrition-related regulatory decision-making and 
consumer outreach and education related to nutrition.
HEALTHY PEOPLE
Healthy People is a national health promotion and disease 
prevention agenda that provides a framework to achieve  
10-year goals and objectives to improve the nation’s health.  
The Healthy People initiative, which began more than 30 years 
ago, is grounded in the principle that setting national objectives 
and monitoring progress toward achieving them can motivate 
action.
Healthy People objectives are organized within distinct topic 
areas, for which multiple agencies provide leadership. NIH 
co-leads many of the topic areas, including the Nutrition 
and Weight Status Topic Area. For more information about 
objectives that monitor access to healthier foods, weight reduction and nutritional counseling in health care and 
worksite settings, weight status, food insecurity, food and 
nutrient consumption, and iron deficiency, view the Healthy  
People 2020 Midcourse Review for Nutrition and Weight Status .
In 2020, a new set of science-based, 10-year national 
objectives— Healthy People 2030— was launched with the 
goal of improving the health of all Americans by 2030. 
The development of Healthy People 2030 included the 
establishment of a framework  for the initiative—including the 
vision, mission, foundational principles, plan of action, and 
overarching goals—and identifying new objectives.
INTERAGENCY COMMITTEE ON HUMAN NUTRITION RESEARCH 
The Interagency Committee on Human Nutrition Research  
(ICHNR)  aims to increase the overall effectiveness and 
productivity of federally supported or conducted human 
nutrition research. Established in 1983 and reassembled 
in 2013, the ICHNR is charged with improving planning, 
coordination, and communication among federal agencies 
engaged in nutrition research and facilitating the development and updating of plans for federal research programs to 
meet current and future domestic and international needs 
for nutrition. ICHNR includes representatives from HHS, 
DoD, EPA, USAID, USDA, the U.S. Department of Commerce, 
Federal Trade Commission, National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration, National Science Foundation, Veterans Health 
Administration, and the White House Office of Science and 18
NIH NUTRITION RESEARCH REPORT 2020 –2021Technology Policy. In addition to its interagency coordination 
and communication roles, ICHNR strives to increase the 
effectiveness and productivity of federal agencies that are 
engaged in nutrition research by supporting activities to inform researchers and policy staff on ongoing federally 
supported or conducted human nutrition research, nutrition 
monitoring, and nutrition program activities.
NATIONAL COLLABORATIVE ON CHILDHOOD OBESITY RESEARCH 
The National Collaborative on Childhood Obesity Research  
(NCCOR)  is a public–private partnership undertaken by 
CDC, USDA, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and 
four NIH ICs—NCI, NICHD, NIDDK, NHLBI, and the Office 
of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR). The 
initiative was launched in 2009 with a primary mission of 
improving the efficiency, effectiveness, and application of 
childhood obesity research and halting and reversing the 
childhood obesity epidemic through enhanced coordination 
and collaboration. The NCCOR partnership has focused 
its efforts on identifying, designing, and implementing 
innovative, practical, and sustainable interventions in 
diverse settings; increasing national, state, and local obesity 
surveillance activities; supporting childhood obesity research 
and program evaluation activities; and identifying ways to 
optimize research outcomes, build capacity for new research and surveillance, and create and support the mechanisms 
and infrastructure needed for research translation and 
dissemination. These efforts have proven enormously 
successful. NCCOR partners have formed strategic alliances 
with diverse groups, produced education and training 
resources for researchers and stakeholders, and informed the 
broader research community and policymakers of progress in 
child obesity prevention.
The 2020 NCCOR Annual Report  and 2021 NCCOR Annual  
Report  are available on the NCCOR website . NCCOR provides 
a variety of unique tools that may be of key interest to 
researchers. These include a  Measures Registry , four 
Measures Registry User Guides , Measures Registry Learning  
Modules , a Catalogue of Surveillance Systems , a Registry of  
Studies , and a Youth Compendium of Physical Activit ies.
NATIONAL FOOD AND NUTRIENT ANALYSIS PROGRAM
Federal food and dietary supplement product database 
activities have been coordinated through the National Food  
and Nutrient Analysis Program (NFNAP)  initiative since 
1997. NFNAP is directed by the USDA ARS’ Methods and 
Application of Food Composition Laboratory (newly formed 
from a consolidation of the Nutrient Data Laboratory and the 
Food Composition and Methods Development Laboratory) in 
collaboration with NCI and ODS, along with other NIH ICOs 
and the FDA.
The five specific aims of NFNAP are to (1) institute a 
monitoring program for key foods and critical nutrients (to 
date, approximately 1,400 foods have been sampled and 
analyzed); (2) conduct comprehensive analyses of selected key 
foods; (3) develop databases for high-priority foods consumed 
by U.S. ethnic subpopulations; (4) develop databases for new bioactive components; and (5) develop a validated database 
for ingredients in dietary supplements. For each specific aim, 
the process includes the identification of foods for analysis, 
development of unique statistically based sampling plans, 
and application of validated analytical chemistry. The primary 
outcome of the initiative is to develop comprehensive nutrient 
composition databases that have unprecedented analytical 
quality.
Several recent accomplishments in food composition analysis 
and database development can be traced to the NFNAP 
initiative. A review of the past two decades of collaboration 
can be found on PubMed.gov . The NFNAP initiative also 
has supported dietary supplements research and database 
development—including the DSID, which stemmed from the 
NFNAP initiative—and the DSLD. Both are described above.19
NIH NUTRITION RESEARCH REPORT 2020 –2021X. NIH Institute, Center, and Office Research

NIH NUTRITION RESEARCH REPORT 2020 –2021CLINICAL CENTER
https://clinicalcenter.nih.gov  
OVERVIEW
The Clinical Center at NIH in Bethesda, Maryland, is part of NIH’s intramural science research program and is the nation’s 
largest hospital devoted entirely to clinical research. It is a national resource that makes it possible to rapidly translate scientific 
observations and laboratory discoveries into new approaches for diagnosing, treating, and preventing disease. Currently, 
about 1,600 clinical research studies are in progress at the NIH Clinical Center. The clinical trials at the NIH Clinical Center are 
predominantly Phase I and Phase II, and they often are first-in-human studies to test safety and efficacy.
More than 500,000 patients, from all 50 states and throughout the world, have participated in clinical research at the Clinical 
Center since it opened in 1953.
The Clinical Center promotes translational research—that is, the transfer of scientific laboratory research into applications that 
benefit patient health and medical care. The “bench-to-bedside” approach adopted in 1953 locates patient care units in close 
proximity to cutting-edge laboratories conducting related research. This facilitates interaction and collaboration among clinicians 
and researchers. Most importantly, patients and families in the Clinical Center benefit from the cutting-edge technologies and 
research and the compassionate care that are the signature of NIH.
The Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center was opened in 2005. The facility houses inpatient units, day hospitals, and research 
laboratories and connects to the original Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center. Together, the Magnuson and Hatfield buildings 
form the NIH Clinical Center. They serve the dual role of providing humane and healing patient care and the environment clinical 
researchers need to advance clinical science. It was named in honor of Senator Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon, who supported 
medical research throughout his congressional career.
The 870,000-square-foot Hatfield building has 200 inpatient beds and 93 day-hospital stations. This arrangement can be easily 
adapted to allow more inpatient beds and fewer day-hospital stations, or vice versa, because the facility’s design is highly flexible.
NUTRITION RESEARCH SERVICES
Clinical Research Dietitians consult with NIH institute and 
center investigators to plan, design, and implement nutrition-
related components of proposed research protocols. Dietitians 
recommend optimal methodologies to ensure valid and reliable 
data and assist with data collection, analysis, interpretation, 
and manuscript preparation. Dietitians also advise on the 
benefit and appropriateness of adding nutrition services to 
existing research protocols.
Nutrition research services include ─
 ▶ Research Meals/Diets  
Purpose: to control food and nutrient intake to meet 
protocol needs. Research meals are prepared in a dedicated 
kitchen using specialized equipment and software. ▶ Dietary Intake and Eating Behavior Assessments  
Purpose: to quantify energy and nutrient intake for a 
defined period of time; to characterize eating behaviors. 
Specialized software and questionnaires are used to analyze 
food intake.
 ▶ Body Composition Analysis  
Purpose: to assess lean and fat mass.
 ▶ Nutrition Counseling  
Purpose: to provide nutrition education and counseling to 
research subjects as part of protocol requirements

The Fogarty International Center (FIC) is dedicated to advancing the mission of NIH  by supporting and facilitating global health 
research conducted by U.S. and international investigators, building partnerships between health research institutions in the 
United States and abroad, and training future generations of scientists to address global health needs. FIC currently funds 
more than 400 research and training projects involving more than 100 U.S. universities and investigators in numerous foreign 
countries, most of which are in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). FIC staff engage with scientists around the world 
to address critical global health research problems, such as emerging infectious diseases, and highlight the need to strengthen 
research capacity in LMICs.
FIC has a strong interest in nutrition as it relates to overall global health. Recent nutrition-related research and research training 
projects funded by FIC aim to do the following:
 ▶ Provide short-, intermediate-, and long-term training 
to health professionals who are engaged in population-
based and clinical and translational noncommunicable 
disease research focused on bone health and vitamin D 
supplementation across the lifespan through the Lebanon-
based Scholars in HeAlth Research Program (SHARP).1
 ▶ Train doctoral students and postdoctoral fellows at Makerere 
University in Uganda in the epidemiology and pathogenesis 
of infection-related neurocognitive impairment, including 
the assessment of the interactions of micronutrient 
deficiency and infection, with the goal of establishing 
a cohort of Ugandan researchers who can advance the 
understanding, prevention, and treatment of long-term 
neurocognitive disability associated with infectious diseases 
and micronutrient deficiency.2
 ▶ Identify risk factors for suboptimal breastfeeding and 
opportunities for breastfeeding promotion among working  
mothers and determine the impact of adopting policies

1996, with young-adult follow-up performed 15–20 years 
later. This research project aims to determine the long-term 
health impact of early-childhood diarrhea, pneumonia, 
and nutritional status on later growth and educational 
development. The researchers found that “childhood 
undernutrition was related to adolescent height, and 
thereby weakly to cognitive score, whereas educational 
opportunities and cultural language group were more 
strongly associated with human capital than childhood 
illness was.”9
 ▶ The MAL-ED (Malnutrition and Enteric Diseases) project 
was an international collaboration investigating the effects 
of enteric pathogens, nutrition, and socioeconomic status 
on childhood development, including gut physiology, 
immune function, vaccine response, physical growth, and 
cognitive development. A prospective observational study 
of cohorts of neonates followed to age 24 months was 
conducted at geographically diverse sites in Bangladesh, 
Brazil, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Peru, South Africa, and Tanzania. A second study followed the cohorts until 5 years 
of age. Conducted from 2008 to 2019, the multisite project 
was supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. 
Results from this project currently are being published, with 
more than 20 articles published between 2020 and 2021.
 ▶ The Childhood Obesity Prevention Across Borders: The 
Promise of U.S.–Latin American Research Collaboration 
addresses the multifaceted nature of childhood obesity 
prevention in Latin America and among Latino populations 
in the United States. Sharing research strategies and proven 
methods among researchers from Latin America and the 
United States, especially those working with U.S. Latino 
populations, helped identify common ground and lessons 
learned for the adaptation and implementation of evidence-
informed childhood obesity prevention interventions. The 
subsequent peer-reviewed scientific journal supplement, 
published in English and Spanish in Obesity Review, explores 
nine crosscutting themes and articulates a shared research 
agenda to address childhood obesity prevention in Latin 
America and among Latino populations in the United 
States.10,11

Nutrition Research Spending for Fiscal Year 2021 (FY21) $154,938,472
Nutrition as Percentage of Total IC Obligations for FY21 2.2%
OVERVIEW
Cancer  is the second-leading cause of death  in the United States.12 In 2022, there will be an estimated 1.9 million new cancer cases 
diagnosed and 609,360 cancer deaths in the United States.13 Since the National Cancer Institute (NCI) was established in 1937, 
scientists have identified various cancer-related factors, such as genetics and environmental exposures. Foods, alcohol, and their 
associated constituents are thought to be environmental factors that can significantly influence cancer risk and tumor behavior. 
The complexity of this area is expanded by the thousands of dietary components that are consumed.
Cancer research and training are performed and supported by both intramural and extramural programs at NCI. NCI makes 
awards to investigators residing in the United States and at international sites. NCI’s goal is to support research that ultimately 
leads to important clinical outcomes: improvements in prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship that can reduce 
the incidence, morbidity, and mortality of all types of cancer. NCI requires a wide range of research disciplines that span the 
continuum from basic science to clinical research to research on implementation and cancer care delivery. Areas of research that 
NCI supports include basic sciences, such as genetics, genomics, cell biology, immunology, and nanotechnology; translational 
and clinical sciences, such as drug development and testing, diagnostics, and the discovery and development of molecular 
markers, advanced imaging technologies, and new radiotherapy techniques; population sciences, such as population genetics, 
epidemiology, and environmental sciences; and behavioral sciences at biological, psychological, sociocultural, environmental, 
and policy levels. NCI supports various interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary training programs in basic, clinical, and population 
sciences to foster the development of future national and international scientific leaders who will use modern approaches and 
technologies to address critical issues in cancer. NCI provides various dietary assessment research resources, such as dietary 
collection resources (e.g., Dietary Assessment Primer), data collection tools (e.g., Automated Self-Administered 24-Hour Dietary 
Recall, Diet History Questionnaire), food composition databases, and dietary analysis tools (e.g., Healthy Eating Index, World 
Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research Score).
NCI nutrition research incorporates a variety of approaches to determine the influence of diet, dietary patterns, and dietary 
components on the cancer process, including epidemiologic studies (i.e., cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort studies), 
clinical intervention studies, compositional studies involving food content and components, preclinical studies (e.g., animal 
models and cell cultures), clinical studies of biochemical/physiologic assessments of nutrient metabolism and absorption 
patterns, and studies of diet and lifestyle behaviors. In addition, NCI provides summaries of ongoing research related to nutrition 
and cancer through websites, such as those listed below, and other programs within the Office of Communications and Public 
Liaison.

frequency questionnaire developed by NCI staff for use by 
researchers, clinicians, or educators. 
Dietary Assessment Prime r: This resource helps researchers 
determine the best way to assess diet for any study in which 
estimates of group intake are required. 
Healthy Eating Index (HEI) : The HEI is a measure of diet quality, 
independent of quantity, that can be used to assess compliance 
with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and monitor 
changes in dietary patterns. 
Measures Registry Resource Suite : The Measures Registry 
Resource Suite, developed through a public–private 
partnership, offers research tools spanning four domains 
of childhood obesity research: diet, physical activity, the 
food environment, and the physical activity environment. 
It includes the Measures Registry, Measures Registry User 
Guides, Measures Registry Learning Modules, and Measures for 
Children at High Risk for Obesity Decision Tree. 
World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF)/American Institute for  
Cancer Research (AICR) Score : The 2018 WCRF/AICR Score is a 
standardized scoring system that can be used by researchers 
to assess adherence to the 2018 WCRF/AICR Cancer Prevention Recommendations and examine associations with cancer-
related and other health outcomes. 
Health Behaviors Research Branch : The branch aims to 
support research at multiple levels of analysis to improve 
cancer-related health behaviors and risk factors. 
The Classification of Laws Associated with School Students  
(CLASS) : CLASS protects the well-being of students by 
monitoring, classifying, and evaluating physical education and 
nutrition policies across the United States. 
Metabolic Epidemiology Branch : The branch’s research mission 
is to conduct collaborative high-impact epidemiological 
research on metabolic and lifestyle causes of cancer that will 
guide prevention and early intervention strategies worldwide. 
Nutritional Science Research Group (NSRG) : The NSRG 
promotes and supports studies establishing a comprehensive 
understanding of the precise role of diet and food components 
in modifying cancer risk and tumor cell behavior. 
Trans-NCI Obesity and Cancer Working Group : The purpose of 
the work group is to promote the exchange of information and 
crosscutting interests in obesity and cancer research within 
NCI.

OVERVIEW
The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) is the federal government’s lead agency for scientific 
research on complementary and integrative health. The center’s mission is to determine, through rigorous scientific investigation, 
the fundamental science, usefulness, and safety of complementary and integrative health approaches and their roles in improving 
health and health care. NCCIH supports research on a diverse group of nondrug and noninvasive health practices encompassing 
nutritional, psychological, and physical approaches that may have originated outside of conventional medicine, many of which are 
gradually being integrated into mainstream health care. These include natural products—such as dietary supplements, plant-
based products, and probiotics—as well as mind and body approaches—such as yoga, massage therapy, meditation, mindfulness-
based stress reduction, spinal and joint manipulation, and acupuncture. In clinical practice, these approaches are often combined 
into multicomponent therapeutic systems—such as traditional Chinese medicine, Ayurveda, chiropractic, osteopathy, and 
naturopathy—that have distinctive underlying diagnostic and theoretical frameworks. Integrative health care seeks to bring 
conventional and complementary approaches together in a safe, coordinated manner, with the goal of improving clinical care for 
patients, restoring health, promoting resilience, and preventing disease.
NATURAL PRODUCTS RESEARCH
Establishing priorities across the field of complementary and 
integrative health research is enormously challenging. NCCIH-
supported research clearly intersects with nutrition, as is 
exemplified by the NCCIH’s robust natural products research 
portfolio, which includes research on dietary supplements, 
herbal and botanical products, probiotics, and food-based 
phytochemicals. NCCIH also supports research on certain types of diets (e.g., ketogenic). The center’s research on 
natural products relies heavily on the methods and tools of 
pharmacology and pharmacognosy. NCCIH has established 
rigorous standards and policies for the quality and integrity 
of products used in NCCIH-supported research. Further 
information on the NCCIH policy on the integrity of natural  
products  is available on the center’s website. 
RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
NCCIH research priorities are guided by its Strategic Plan . Our 
primary research objectives are as follows:
 ▶ Advance fundamental science and methods development.
 ▶ Advance research on the whole person and on the 
integration of complementary and conventional care.
 ▶ Foster research on health promotion and restoration, 
resilience, disease prevention, and symptom management.
 ▶ Enhance the complementary and integrative health 
research workforce.
 ▶ Provide objective, evidence-based information on 
complementary and integrative health interventions.NCCIH has a broad interest in studying the biological activities 
of such natural products as prebiotics, probiotics, dietary 
supplements, botanicals, and vitamins. A strong research 
emphasis is placed on products for which there is compelling 
preclinical evidence of potential biological activity that 
may lead to a health benefit or treatment intervention and 
products that are widely used by the American public. Many 
of the natural products used by individuals are complex, with 
multiple molecular constituents that may contribute to their 
effects. To fully understand the activity of complex mixtures, it 
is necessary to identify the individual components responsible 
for a specific activity and determine how those components 
interact with other components and biological targets. 
Preclinical model systems are valuable for these studies. 
Clinical trials of natural products are maximally informative 
if they incorporate well-formulated biological hypotheses, 28
NIH NUTRITION RESEARCH REPORT 2020 –2021are built on a sound foundation of basic mechanistic and 
pharmacologic understanding, and incorporate an assessment 
of defined signatures of biological effects. Thus, the design 
of maximally informative clinical efficacy trials of natural 
products requires mechanistic insight as a first step.
NCCIH will continue to support research on isolated natural 
product compounds and the complex mixtures from which 
they originate. Studies also may focus on both the potential 
beneficial and harmful effects of natural products, including 
their interactions with medications. NCCIH-supported 
studies also may include the characterization of novel natural 
products or the discovery of the biological activity of chemical 
constituents in a complex mixture.
Historically, NCCIH has supported most basic and 
translational research and development activities relevant 
to complementary approaches in natural products research 
through investigator-initiated research grants. This is 
augmented with targeted initiatives to address high-priority 
research topics. Solicitations across the broad spectrum of  
NCCIH’s research  may be found on the center’s website. This broad-based approach has yielded a robust pipeline of 
basic to clinical research, as well as a large body of information 
and promising leads for future research. For example, NCCIH 
is supporting a Center of Excellence for Natural Product Drug 
Interaction Research that is focused, in part, on conducting 
rigorous human subject studies to establish the clinical 
relevance of interactions for selected natural products. NCCIH 
also supports rigorous screening of natural product libraries in 
assays with clear relevance to human metabolism for evidence 
of pharmacokinetic interactions. The data generated will 
provide additional information on potential interactions and 
help inform prioritization strategies regarding which natural 
products may warrant future investments in clinical studies.
NCCIH also will continue to support research to elucidate 
the effects of probiotics and prebiotics on the microbiota 
naturally present in the human body. It seeks to address 
fundamental knowledge gaps, including those pertaining 
to molecular mechanisms of action of the microbiota and 
potential interactions with pre- and probiotics and their 
impact on processes in the human body. NCCIH will continue 
to work closely with other NIH institutes, centers, and offices—
including the NIH ONR and ODS, FDA, and USDA—to leverage 
its investments in this research area.

NIH NUTRITION RESEARCH REPORT 2020 –2021NATIONAL EYE INSTITUTE
https://www.nei.nih.gov
Nutrition Research Spending for Fiscal Year 2021 (FY21) $18,672,702
Nutrition as Percentage of Total IC Obligations for FY21 2.3%
OVERVIEW
The mission of the National Eye Institute (NEI) is to eliminate vision loss and improve quality of life globally through vision 
research. The global burden of vision impairment is estimated to be 1.1 billion individuals—43 million of whom are blind.14 
However, more than 90 percent of visual impairment cases are considered treatable or preventable. Nutrition is a key component 
of eye health. For example, vitamin A deficiency can cause xerophthalmia, a form of blindness found in children and pregnant 
women in some lower- and middle-income countries. Although there is truth to the popular notion that eating carrots is good 
for your eyes (carrots are rich in beta-carotene, a building block of vitamin A production), NEI research broadly evaluates the 
effects of nutritional factors, such as vitamins and trace minerals with antioxidant capabilities, in preventing eye disease. The 
Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS), a major NEI epidemiological and randomized placebo-controlled trial showed that high 
levels of antioxidants (vitamins C and E and beta carotene) and zinc plus copper reduced the risk of progression to late age-related 
macular degeneration (AMD) by 25 percent in 5 years for those at high risk. Beta-carotene can increase the risk of lung cancer 
in current and former smokers. The AREDS2 trial demonstrated that a new formulation substituting the antioxidants lutein 
and zeaxanthin for beta-carotene provides a safe and effective treatment for people at risk of late AMD and that the addition of 
omega-3 fatty acids to the AREDS supplements had neither a beneficial nor a harmful effect on progression to late AMD.
RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
The following projects represent some of the nutrition-related research areas supported by NEI:
14 Burton MJ, et al. The Lancet Global Health Commission on Global Eye Health: vision beyond 2020. Lancet Glob Health.  2021 Apr;9(4):e489-e551. 
doi: 10.1016/S2214-109X(20)30488-5. Epub 2021 Feb 16. PMID: 33607016; PMCID: PMC7966694. ▶ NEI convened a nutrition workshop that focused on  
B vitamins and very-long-chain fatty acids. Analyzing 
AREDS and AREDS2 data, NEI investigators discovered that 
tracking the severity of AMD progression over 2 years can  
predict the likelihood of vision loss 5 years later, suggesting 
that this scale can be used to shorten clinical trials focused 
on AMD and bring treatments earlier to people who need 
them.
 ▶ Carotenoid levels are known to vary by individual and are 
influenced by such factors as dietary sources, total nutrient 
intake, vitamin supplementation, genetics, and metabolism. 
After 15 years of follow-up with a cohort of women who 
participated in the Women’s Health Initiative, NEI-
supported researchers observed that higher carotenoid 
levels were associated with larger retinal vessels, indicating 
a clinically significant relationship between carotenoid 
levels and incidence or progression of age-related eye 
disease, specifically macular degeneration.
 ▶ Macular pigment (MP) is composed of the dietary 
carotenoids lutein, zeaxanthin, and meso-zeaxanthin and 
declines with age. NEI scientists are investigating MP as  
a modifiable risk factor for AMD and how preserving MP  
 might help reduce risk of developing eye diseases and 
vision loss. On the developmental end of the spectrum, 
evidence indicates that pregnant women actively transport 
carotenoids via the placenta, yet lutein and zeaxanthin are 
rarely incorporated into prenatal vitamins. A randomized 
clinical trial is testing the hypothesis that lutein and 
zeaxanthin supplementation will have benefits for both 
mother and baby, testing such outcomes as maternal visual 
acuity and infant foveal structure at birth.
 ▶ Dry eye disease (DED) affects approximately 14 percent 
of the U.S. population, and it is common practice for DED 
patients to take supplements as part of their treatment. The 
Dry Eye Assessment and Management (DREAM) study is an 
NEI-funded, randomized trial that investigated the effects 
of omega-3 fatty acid (fish oil) supplementation on DED 
patients across 27 U.S. sites. DREAM investigators found that 
fish oil supplements are no better than placebo.  
Ongoing secondary data analyses of DREAM data have 
identified important systemic risk factors for DED.
 ▶ Cocoa products contain epicatechins, a subclass of 
flavonoids that have potential benefits on vasodilation and 
blood pressure. NEI has funded the COcoa-Supplement  
 30
NIH NUTRITION RESEARCH REPORT 2020 –2021and Multivitamins Outcomes Study (COSMOS) eye trial 
to examine the efficacy of cocoa extract supplements in 
reducing the risk of AMD and cataract development in a 
cohort of patients who are participating in the COSMOS 
trial.
 ▶ NEI has funded research investigating vitamin D 
metabolism in the cornea and in tear fluid. Although 
vitamin D is predominantly produced in the skin in 
response to UV sunlight, the cornea also may produce 
it. Vitamin D may have many roles in the eye, from 
healing wounds to controlling intraocular pressure. 
In a prespecified ancillary study to the VITamin D and 
OmegaA-3 TriaL (VITAL), NEI investigators found that after 
5 years of follow-up, neither daily supplementation with 
vitamin D nor with omega-3 fatty acids had a significant 
overall effect on AMD incidence or progression.
 ▶ Vitamin A is the precursor for 11-cis-retinal, a molecule 
essential for vision. Investigations into vitamin A, its 
derivatives, and the proteins that bind and transport it 
to cells are a major focus of NEI-supported research. 
Scientists are exploring the role these substances play 
in the normal metabolism of ocular tissues and in the 
visual cycle. Increasing evidence shows the importance of 
vitamin A derivatives and their binding proteins as potential 
therapeutic targets. Researchers have found that chronic 
deficiency of vitamin A has an effect on ocular tissue 
integrity and metabolism. ▶ Animal models for AMD are often limited because only 
primate eyes have maculae, the small photoreceptor-rich 
region of the central retina needed for fine, detailed vision. 
NEI grants support researchers in studying three aging 
primate (macaque) populations that have had controlled 
diets from previous research: (1) monkeys with lifelong 
healthy diets; (2) monkeys with otherwise healthy diets but 
devoid of the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin; and  
(3) aging monkeys with diets high in fat and sugar, 
mimicking a typical American diet. Animal models also are 
being used to investigate carotenoid-related gene profiles 
during infancy, comparing infants fed with breastmilk, 
formula, and carotenoid-supplemented formula.
 ▶ Premature, low birth weight infants are at high risk for 
retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), a leading cause of ocular 
blindness in children. An NEI study suggested that adding 
dietary fatty acids increases levels of adiponectin, which 
communicates with the retina to regulate the creation 
of disease-causing blood vessels (neovascularization) 
in the eye. Additionally, a recent clinical trial in Sweden 
demonstrated that supplementing the diet of most 
premature infants with a lipid solution reduced the 
prevalence of ROP by 50 percent.

OVERVIEW
Heart diseases remain the leading causes of death in the United States, although the past decade has seen a remarkable decline 
in the disease prevalence in the overall population.15 The prevalence of heart disease and stroke appears to be increasing among 
minority groups,16 and the rate of decline in heart disease prevalence has slowed. Chronic lower respiratory diseases rank sixth 
among the 10 leading causes of death, which account for 74 percent of all deaths in the United States.17 Racial/ethnic minority 
groups are more adversely affected than other groups. These diseases, which are within the purview of the National Heart, 
Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), impose a heavy burden on the health and economy of the American people. Taken together, 
cardiovascular, lower respiratory, and cerebrovascular diseases accounted for three of the six leading causes of death in U.S. 
adults.17 These diseases also account for 29.8% of all deaths in 2020.3 In the United States, the number of deaths attributable 
to cardiovascular disease (CVD) declined from 1999 until 2011, but increased each year from 2012 to 2020 for a total increase of 
nearly 18% (from 787,431 deaths in 2012 to 928,741 deaths in 2020).16,18 The estimated direct and indirect economic cost of heart, 
lung, and blood diseases in the United States was $522.2 billion between 2018 and 2019.4,5 The total economic loss due to sleep 
deficiency and related disorders in the United States is estimated to be $411 billion.19
Nutrition is a major contributor to population health in the United States and globally, and recent estimates suggest that diet-
related risk factors contributed globally to 11 million deaths and 255 million disability-adjusted life years.20 An important overall 
goal of the NHLBI nutrition research program is to promote cardiovascular health and prevent and treat CVDs—such as heart 
attack, stroke, arrhythmias, peripheralarterial disease, and heart failure—and their risk factors. With heart disease as the nation’s 
number-one killer, an important focus of the research is to reduce risk by examining the influence of nutrition and physical 
activity on such well-characterized risk factors as high blood cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, obesity, and poor levels 
of cardiovascular and physical fitness. Consequently, clinical trials also are needed to develop effective solutions to promote 
cardiovascular and respiratory health. Emerging cardiovascular risk factors—including the gut microbiome, inflammatory 
response markers, and metabolites, such as Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO)—also may be influenced by nutrition, and it is hoped 
that a better understanding of these relationships will ultimately provide new approaches to prevent and treat heart diseases. 
Some cases of congenital heart disease also appear to have a nutritional basis and thus may be prevented by improving maternal 
diets and/or nutritional status. Gene–diet interactions and epigenetic changes, as evident from research on developmental origins 
of diseases, have been reported, including adverse prenatal and early-life exposures and the lifelong consequences on metabolic 
risk and health outcomes.
Other critical goals of the NHLBI nutrition research program include prevention and treatment of lung diseases, such as asthma 
and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and blood diseases, such as clotting disorders and sickle cell disease. Recent advances

metabolism and cardiometabolic pathophysiology. Sleep deficiency triggers neural, autonomic, and endocrine mechanisms, 
resulting in changes in appetite regulation, calorie intake, adipose function, and energy expenditure.21,22 The molecular circadian 
clock serves as a cellular energy sensor that responds to dietary nutrients, re-dox state, and adenosine triphosphate availability, 
in turn driving 10 to 20 percent of gene expression in metabolically active tissues.21,22 The circadian clock is well positioned to 
integrate nutrient signaling, cellular metabolism, and systemic physiology contributing to obesity and obesity-related CVD.

encompasses the full research spectrum, including basic 
investigations, epidemiologic and observational studies, 
clinical and community intervention studies, and translation 
and implementation science research. NHLBI also fosters 
collaboration to apply research results and leverage resources to address public health needs nationally and internationally. 
In addition, NHLBI supports academic and professional 
training in nutrition research and clinical nutrition, as well as 
the development of innovative nutrition education programs 
for medical students, residents, attending physicians, and other 
health care professionals.

Nutrition Research Spending for Fiscal Year 2021 (FY21) $10,408,983
Nutrition as Percentage of Total IC Obligations for FY21 1.6%
OVERVIEW
Since the completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003, National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)-supported 
research has focused on advancing genomic science and medicine through a deeper understanding of genome structure and 
function; the relationships between genes, environment, and human health; and attitudes and behaviors related to genomic 
information.
As part of its mission to advance genomic science and medicine, NHGRI funds research on the complex relationships between 
genomics and nutrition-relevant variables. Genomics plays an essential role in individual variation in metabolism and 
predisposition for genetically complex diseases, including obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. NHGRI supports studies 
to investigate the interplay between genetic and environmental risk factors for these complex diseases in multiethnic cohorts. In 
addition, NHGRI funds research on how people understand and use genomic information related to obesity risk to shape food and 
nutrition choices.
RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
NHGRI supports research on genomic and environmental 
interactions (GxE), including the interactions of genes and diet 
and nutrition.
NHGRI-funded investigators are elucidating complex 
interactions between genetics and environmental exposures to 
inform our understanding of the contributions of metabolism, 
diet, and eating behaviors to human health and disease. 
Two research groups, including one of NHGRI’s Centers of 
Excellence in Genomic Science (CEGS), are using mouse 
models to study diet and its relationship to metabolic disease 
and developing novel statistical methods to measure gene–
environment interactions contributing to metabolic disease 
states. In addition, NHGRI-funded researchers are applying 
novel statistical methods measuring synergistic GxE effects 
over time to explore the mechanism of gene-by-hormone 
interaction on women’s eating behavior in a longitudinal study 
on eating disorders.
Folate and vitamin B12 are essential nutrients for cell growth 
and neurological development, and deficiencies increase 
the risk of tumors, miscarriage, birth defects including spina 
bifida, and age-related cognitive problems. NHGRI intramural 
investigators are studying genes that affect folate and 
vitamin B12 metabolism and contribute to disease. Detailed 
knowledge of the function of the genes in the folate/vitamin 
B12 metabolic pathways will add to the understanding of neural tube defects and potentially help guide public health policy in 
the area of nutritional supplementation. NHGRI intramural 
investigators also are conducting clinical and epidemiological 
research on patients with rare inborn errors of metabolism 
related to vitamin B12 metabolic pathways. They have created 
animal models to study these conditions and are continuing to 
develop novel therapies to treat these disorders.
Obesity is a heritable health condition underpinned by a 
combination of genetic and environmental influences. 
Increased understanding and awareness of the heritability of 
obesity can help parents of children with a high risk for obesity 
make informed food choices and form healthy habits early on. 
NHGRI researchers investigated how mothers’ food choices for 
their children are affected by information about family history 
and obesity risk. The researchers also looked at how genetic 
risk information influences mothers’ feelings of guilt, factors 
associated with food choices for children of different genders, 
and how mothers’ weight trajectories influenced their own 
health beliefs and attitudes. The researchers have built on this 
work by recruiting fathers to the study and surveying healthy 
volunteer participants to assess both parents’ and other adults’ 
beliefs about the role of genetics in specific eating behaviors. 
Future directions for this work include evaluating the use 
of virtual reality educational materials to teach individuals 
about the role genes and the environment play in eating 37
NIH NUTRITION RESEARCH REPORT 2020 –2021behaviors. Results could suggest possible risks and benefits 
of integrating genetic risk messages into behavior change 
intervention approaches to promote optimal body weight in 
childhood.Moreover, NHGRI-funded projects are studying 
the relationship between genetic variation and metabolism 
in humans, especially in a variety of diverse populations that 
are underrepresented in genomics research. A more robust 
understanding of how genetic variation affects the risk of 
obesity and metabolic disorders in diverse populations can 
lead to better methods of disease prevention and approaches 
to reducing health disparities. One group of scientists is 
analyzing whole-genome sequences to find genetic variants 
that contribute to obesity and metabolic disorders in Hispanic 
or Latino populations, with a special focus on discovering 
the contributions of rare variants. Another study is using 
samples from a large multiethnic cohort to study genetic 
and environmental contributions to obesity, type 2 diabetes, 
and other traits to create disease risk prediction models for 
ancestrally diverse populations. Investigators co-funded 
by NHGRI are also conducting an innovative randomized 
controlled trial of a community-based weight-loss intervention 
for obese African American and Latino men ages 40 to 59.
Finally, NHGRI investigators and NHGRI-funded investigators 
also are exploring how genetic and environmental factors 
contribute to complex diseases in Africans and African Americans. Led by NHGRI, NIH’s Common Fund program 
Human Heredity and Health in Africa (H3Africa) has projects 
aimed at (1) building infrastructure and capacity to understand 
how genetic and environmental factors contribute to obesity 
and cardiometabolic disease in sub-Saharan Africa and  
(2) carrying out studies to identify these genetic factors. NHGRI 
intramural investigators are participating in the development 
and implementation of protocols for H3Africa projects and 
have helped design a custom chip array for genotyping in 
African populations. Working in concert with the H3Africa 
Consortium, NHGRI intramural investigators are performing 
analyses to identify genes and gene pathways important to 
the pathophysiology of severe acute childhood malnutrition 
and modifiers of sickle cell disease in African populations. 
Intramural researchers also are conducting studies outside 
of the H3Africa program to understand the genetic basis 
of diabetes, obesity, and heart disease in African diaspora 
populations, as well as other projects that seek to understand 
metabolic disorders and dyslipidemia in populations of African 
ancestry. NHGRI also co-funds the Breast Milk Microbiota 
Influence on Infant Immunity and Growth (BEAMING) study, 
which aims to understand how breast milk affects the gut 
bacteria of infants in Nigeria and South Africa and how this, in 
turn, affects their growth and ability to respond to childhood 
vaccination.

OVERVIEW
As stated in the latest report by the Administration on Aging (AoA), 16 percent of Americans were age 65 years or older in 2019. By 
2040, this number is expected to be almost 22 percent. As the long-standing mission of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) has 
been to support and conduct genetic, biological, clinical, behavioral, social, and economic research on aging, NIA is committed to 
supporting a range of research to advance the understanding of the nutritional influences on health and function during aging 
and to apply this information to the development of intervention strategies (pharmacological and non-pharmacological) in 
promoting healthy aging and the well-being of older adults with improved lifestyle and psychosocial status.
Research on nutrition and aging is supported by all four of NIA’s extramural divisions—Division of Aging Biology (DAB), Division 
of Behavioral and Social Research (DBSR), Division of Geriatrics and Clinical Gerontology (DGCG), and Division of Neuroscience 
(DN). In addition, a number of laboratories within the NIA’s Intramural Research Program, most notably the Translational  
Gerontology Branch , are conducting cutting-edge research in understanding the fundamental mechanisms of aging and 
developing dietary and nutrition interventions to support healthy aging.
RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
NIA’s priorities, ongoing research, and future directions on 
nutrition and aging are informed by program evaluation 
of research gaps and emerging topics, as well as input and 
recommendations from scientific advisors and NIA workshops.

OVERVIEW
The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) supports nutrition research through programs in basic and 
clinical sciences and seeks to identify the complex relationships between alcohol consumption, nutritional status, and health.
RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
Examples of the nutrition research encouraged and supported by NIAAA are—
 ▶ Studies on alcohol metabolism and its effect on autonomic 
signals involved in alcohol and food intake
 ▶ Studies on alcohol effects on the absorption, utilization, and 
excretion of minerals (iron, magnesium, zinc, selenium, and 
calcium) to clarify the role that alcohol-induced changes 
in these minerals may play in inducing pathological 
consequences of chronic alcohol consumption, such as liver 
fibrosis and hypertension
 ▶ Studies on ethanol alteration of the distribution of essential 
fatty acids and prostanoid production and the role of 
eicosanoids in alcohol-induced physiological changes
 ▶ The role of alcohol-induced malnutrition in the pathogenesis 
of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), including impaired placental 
transport of nutrients
 ▶ Studies of alcohol–nutrient interactions related to possible

OVERVIEW
Although the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) was established in 1948, it traces its roots back to the 
Laboratory of Hygiene, a bacteriological laboratory that was founded in 1887 and was the forerunner of NIH and NIAID. NIAID 
supports basic and clinical research in microbiology, infectious diseases, immunology, and allergy. A major component of NIAID’s 
basic research is concerned with fundamental life processes as exemplified in microorganisms and in animal cells in vitro. 
Techniques and basic biologic principles developed because of this fundamental research in microbiology and immunology have 
been applied to other areas of biology and medicine, including nutrition.
The complex interrelationships among nutrition, microbial infections, and immunology have important health implications. 
In the developing world, more than 1.7 billion cases of infectious diarrheal disease occur annually in children under the age of 
5 years. Malnutrition both predisposes to diarrhea and occurs as a result of diarrhea. Poor nutrition compromises the immune 
system, and children who are malnourished are more vulnerable to life-threatening infectious diseases, as well as physical and 
cognitive impairments. Immunodeficiency states, such as HIV/AIDS, cause malnutrition and set the stage for coinfections and 
comorbidities that accelerate the cycle of malnutrition and infection. Asthma and allergic diseases affect more than 60 million 
Americans. Surgery and trauma lay the groundwork for infection and subsequent malnutrition. Many of these infections and 
conditions, or their complications, can be mitigated, at least in part, by appropriate nutrition.
NIAID studies on nutrition are an integral part of the institute’s research to lessen the adverse health consequences of 
immunologic, allergic, and infectious diseases. Of particular significance are the consequences of wasting on the underlying  
HIV/AIDS disease process, including its infectious and immunological complications, and the role of nutrition in the development 
of safe and effective vaccines against infectious diseases. Continuing concerns are the prevalence of infections among the 
malnourished; the effect of infections on nutritional status; host–microbiome interactions and their relationship to nutrition in 
health and disease; the prevalence and control of acute respiratory infections and food-borne microbial illness; and the effect of 
malnutrition on resistance to infection, especially to infectious diarrhea and respiratory infections, in young children.
RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
NIAID’s interest in nutrition aims at a better understanding 
of the complex interrelationships of nutrition, immunity, and 
infection to expand knowledge that can be applied to develop 
improved diagnostics and strategies for the prevention and 
treatment of inflammation and infection. The institute’s 
research directions are correspondingly varied. They include 
the following:
 ▶ All aspects of nutrition and the prevention, development, 
consequences, and treatment of HIV/AIDS; the relationship 
of nutrition to the development and treatment of 
comorbidities (such as osteopenia) associated with HIV 
disease and treatment; the relationship of nutrition to the 
pathogenesis and treatment of pediatric HIV disease, such 
as growth and development, including the impact of  
 
 infant feeding choices; and the impact of undernutrition on 
absorption and pharmacodynamics of antiretroviral agents
 ▶ The negative effect of malnutrition on resistance to tropical 
infections, especially infectious diarrheas and tuberculosis, 
and the role of breast milk as a defense against enteric 
infections
 ▶ The role of host–microbiome interactions and their 
relationship to nutrition in disease and in determining 
optimal outcome of vaccines, immunotherapies, and organ 
transplantation

INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH AND

https://www.nichd.nih.gov
Nutrition Research Spending for Fiscal Year 2021 (FY21) $115,079,645
Nutrition as Percentage of Total IC Obligations for FY21 6.9%
OVERVIEW
Consistent with the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ( NICHD) mission, the 
nutrition research program is focused on the continuum of human development, from pre-conception, pregnancy, and lactation 
through infancy, childhood, and adolescence. The nutrition research program emphasizes the evidence base needed to support 
domestic and global programs in health promotion and disease prevention through expanded understanding of the role of diet 
and nutrition in normal development, as well as the myriad conditions and stresses that can impact health.
RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
Coordinated through the Pediatric Growth and Nutrition 
Branch, NICHD’s extramural nutrition portfolio is 
multidisciplinary in nature; includes basic, translational, 
clinical, and applied research; and is aimed at promoting 
health and mitigating disease during critical periods in human 
development. The NICHD Strategic Plan 2020  established the 
following areas of focus for the extramural nutrition research 
portfolio:
 ▶ Human Milk Composition and Function  
Information is limited regarding the composition of the 
bioactive components (nutritive and non-nutritive) of 
human milk and the functional mechanisms by which 
human milk components—both acting individually and 
together—affect the health of the infant and lactating 
parent.
 ▶ Nutrition for Preterm Infants  
Even though preterm birth accounts for more than 10% of 
live births in the United States and is a strong predictor of 
infant morbidity and mortality, no accepted standards exist 
for the nutritional care of preterm infants that cover their 
full developmental range, from infants born at the limits of 
viability to those born “near term.” ▶ Childhood Growth  
Translational studies have shown that hormones and 
cytokines secreted from bone and muscle may be essential 
for normal linear growth and skeletal development. 
Furthermore, translational studies suggest that bone cells 
secrete hormones that may regulate metabolism and 
fertility. However, many gaps remain in our understanding 
of normal growth and development, and little existing 
research characterizes the endocrine functions of bone or 
describes its effects on the multitude of temporal changes 
that occur during growth and development over the various 
stages of childhood.
 ▶ Childhood Obesity  
Childhood obesity is a serious problem in the United 
States, with a prevalence approaching 20% in children and 
adolescents ages 2 to 19 years, putting affected youth at 
risk for poor short- and long-term health. However, the 
pathophysiology of obesity in youth differs from that in 
adults, and there is a dearth of knowledge about how to 
effectively prevent and treat childhood obesity, especially in 
high-risk populations.

OVERVIEW
The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) conducts and supports research and research 
training on normal mechanisms, as well as on diseases and disorders of hearing, balance, taste, smell, voice, speech, and 
language.
Chemical Senses—Taste and Smell
The chemical senses—more commonly known as taste, smell, 
and chemesthesis (chemically provoked irritation)—enable 
people to use chemical signals to communicate with the 
environment and one another. For people, memories of taste 
and smell experiences are vivid and long lasting and play an 
important role in the enjoyment of life.
The chemical senses are important for regulating food 
preferences and intake. They evolved to help humans and other 
animals survive in environments where required nutrients 
were scarce and many plants contained poisonous, bitter 
compounds. Consequently, humans seek out sweet, fatty 
foods and tend to reject the bitterness that characterizes many 
nutritious vegetables. Although this behavior made sense 
as humans were evolving, an almost limitless availability of 
high-calorie foods today can cause the normal function of taste 
and smell to lead to overconsumption and obesity. More than 
two of every three adults are considered to be overweight or 
obese, and more than one of every three adults is considered 
to be obese. Individuals who are overweight or obese are at 
risk of numerous serious conditions (e.g., type 2 diabetes, heart 
disease, and sleep apnea).
People with smell disorders often have problems appreciating 
the smell of foods and claim that food is less enjoyable. They 
may change their eating habits, which may have a long-term 
impact on overall health. Loss of the sense of smell may also cause a person to add too much sugar or salt to make food taste 
better. This can be a problem for people with certain medical 
conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure. In addition, 
cancer treatments, such as radiation and chemotherapy, may 
result in taste and smell loss and an associated decrease in 
appetite, complicating treatment.
Humans seek out their preferred flavors in foods. Flavor 
involves interactions between the sensors that signal taste, 
temperature, touch, smell, and chemesthetic sensations 
associated with foods and the parts of the brain that interpret, 
remember, or think about them. Flavor plays an important role 
in determining whether someone accepts a particular food 
and how much of it they choose to eat. Scientists studying the 
chemical senses are interested in learning more about the 
molecular and developmental bases for how flavors influence 
food intake and overall health.
Scientists are interested in learning more about how the body 
detects and responds to salt, fats, and other food characteristics 
that humans seek out. Data gained from these studies can 
help determine new strategies to control overconsumption 
and improve health without reducing the enjoyment of food. 
Ongoing research is studying the structure and function of 
discrete taste, smell, and chemesthetic receptors, as well as 
their targets within the brain.
RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
NIDCD’s Priority Areas in Taste and Smell Research
With the help of experts in the field of chemical senses, NIDCD 
has identified the following areas of research opportunity and 
areas where gaps in knowledge are hampering understanding. For more detail, please refer to the NIDCD 2017–2021 Strategic  
Plan for Research .47
NIH NUTRITION RESEARCH REPORT 2020 –2021Priority Area 1: Understanding Normal Function
 ▶ Fundamental Biology of Chemosensory Function: Continue 
to develop and apply new tools and approaches to delineate 
the organization of molecules, cells, and neural circuits 
underlying the function of the chemesthetic (trigeminal), 
gustatory, and olfactory systems, including development, 
cell turnover, regeneration, and plasticity.
 ▶ Peripheral and Central Bases of Flavor:  Understand the 
complex interactions between peripheral and central 
aspects of flavor perception, including retronasal or 
orthonasal olfaction, oral chemesthesis (chemical 
irritation), taste, oral somesthesis (temperature, texture), 
memory, and motivational state (such as hunger).
 ▶ Sentinel/Sensory Functions: Describe how chemical senses 
help us avoid dangers, such as spoiled or contaminated 
foods, how they detect potentially toxic chemicals in the 
environment and in our bodies, and how these protective 
functions can be damaged and regenerated.
 ▶ Genetic Aspects of Chemosensory Sensitivity
 » Genomics: Identify genes involved in the development 
and normal function of the taste and smell systems, 
including the use of single-cell profiling approaches.
 » Variation:  Describe the normal variation in taste 
and smell sensitivity. Identify the genes involved 
to understand what is outside the range of normal 
function. Describe how such variation may relate to 
susceptibility for human communication disorders. » Experience: Identify genes involved with storing 
memories of taste and smell. Determine how 
experience influences future diet.
 » Epigenetics: Describe how external factors  
(e.g., sensory experience, diet, stress) activate and 
deactivate genes.
 » Central Control of Taste and Smell: Characterize 
top-down control within the central nervous system 
that modulates sensory input, sensory processing, 
and perception, and determine how such activity may 
change depending on internal state, motivational, or 
cognitive factors.
 ▶ Developing Tools to Measure Taste and Smell Function: 
Refine, develop, and apply appropriate psychophysical 
and behavioral methods for assessing taste and smell 
functions in animal models and humans. Provide practicing 
physicians with standardized tools to test taste and smell 
during physical exams or routine office visits. Develop 
criteria and metrics for the range of “normal” taste and 
smell by analogy to hearing and vision.
 ▶ Develop Novel Approaches to Alter Taste Function:  Alter 
the levels of salt, sugar, and fat intake using innovative 
methods, such as using artificial substitutes or changing 
learned flavor preferences.
Priority Area 2: Understanding Diseases and Disorders
 ▶ Genetic Disorders: Clarify and classify taste and smell 
disorders caused mainly by significant genetic alterations 
(e.g., ciliopathies and channelopathies). Determine the 
normal range of variation of function in the chemical senses 
as related to genetic polymorphisms.
 ▶ Environmental Insults on Taste and Smell: Identify the 
mechanisms that contribute to taste and smell loss or 
dysfunction resulting from radiation, chemotherapy, head 
trauma, and toxins.
 ▶ COVID-19:  Identify the mechanisms underlying 
chemosensory loss in patients with COVID-19. Develop 
cheap, quick, at-home objective chemosensory tests 
to screen for COVID. Determine if COVID-related smell 
loss is predictive of disease severity, other neurological 
manifestations, or the likelihood of developing long-term 
nutrition and health issues. ▶ Sinusitis/Rhinitis: Identify the molecular and cellular bases 
for loss of olfaction following nasal cavity or sinus infection, 
the most common cause of temporary and permanent 
olfactory loss.
 ▶ Understanding How the Activity of the Chemical Senses 
Can Lead to Excessive Consumption or Malnutrition: 
Determine whether calorie intake is affected by normal 
variation or altered function of taste and smell activity.
 ▶ Epidemiology: Describe the incidence and prevalence 
of taste and smell loss and dysfunction. For example, as 
the population ages, determine how many more people 
report taste and smell problems that affect quality of 
life. Enable practical approaches for wider integration of 
standardized chemosensory measurements into large-
scale epidemiological and clinical studies.48
NIH NUTRITION RESEARCH REPORT 2020 –2021Priority Area 3: Improving Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention
 ▶ Improved Diagnostic Tools and Pharmacological 
Treatments: Develop and validate tests to evaluate taste 
and smell function that are practical and affordable for use 
in the office setting. Develop drugs to treat taste and smell 
dysfunction, especially drugs that slow apoptosis (cell death) 
and promote regeneration.
 ▶ Regenerative Medicine/Tissue Engineering: Increase 
understanding of the properties that enable stem cells in 
the peripheral taste and smell pathways to proliferate and differentiate, providing insights not only for the treatment 
of taste and smell loss but also for the treatment of other 
neurological diseases.
 ▶ Enhancing the Clinical Enterprise: Promote clinical training 
in the chemical senses to encourage development of animal 
models of relevant disorders and promote clinical and 
translational research, involving interdisciplinary teams of 
clinicians and basic scientists.
Priority Area 4: Improving Outcomes for Human Communication
 ▶ Translational Research: Translational research in the 
chemical senses is in its infancy, due in part to the modest 
amount of clinical research that has been conducted. 
Currently, no evidence-based preventive measures, 
interventions, or treatments are applied to taste and 
smell dysfunction. Comparative effectiveness research is premature because of the lack of intervention and 
treatment strategies and decisions. Because taste and smell 
loss become increasingly common in a population with a 
growing proportion of older adults, NIDCD has identified 
translational research in the chemical senses as a critical 
gap area.
OUTLOOK
Nutrition is often a significant factor in studies of taste and 
smell, and NIDCD will continue to support chemosensory/
nutrition research through the Taste and Smell Program. Because this research is often of trans-NIH relevance, NIDCD 
will continue to collaborate with other components of NIH.

OVERVIEW
The mission of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) is to improve dental, oral, and craniofacial 
health through research, research training, and the dissemination of health information. NIDCR has a diverse portfolio of research 
related to taste, smell, diet, nutrition, diabetes, obesity, and oral health, including specific research on oral cancer, orofacial 
clefting, dental caries (cavities), and periodontal disease and the impact of oral disease on diet and nutrition intake. NIDCR 
supports research on the three underlying components of caries: oral bacteria, the biology of teeth, and the important role of diet 
and nutrition. Both the types of food consumed and the eating behaviors themselves are key factors in the development of caries. 
A better understanding of the complexity of influences on oral health—including the role of behavior, diet, and nutrition—will be 
essential to designing effective strategies and interventions to improve oral health.

OVERVIEW
The mission of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) is to discover how the environment affects people 
to promote healthier lives. As an institute, NIEHS is uniquely positioned to investigate the interplay between environmental 
exposures, human biology, genetics, and common diseases that limit longevity and quality of life.
Research conducted over the past several decades indicates that disease risk is multifactorial, influenced by diverse elements that 
include exposure to environmental agents—including nutritional sources—and genetic susceptibility. From a pathophysiological 
standpoint, many environmental exposures affect common biological pathways that are linked to disease, such as oxidative stress 
and inflammation; these same pathways are likely to be influenced by diet and nutritional status. Thus, variability in disease risk 
in response to environmental exposures within populations may be at least partially attributable to unmeasured variation in 
nutritional status or other components of the diet. The NIEHS nutrition research portfolio includes projects aimed at (1) more 
clearly identifying those dietary components that influence the onset or trajectory of environmentally linked disease and  
(2) increasing our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the interplay between diet/nutrition and exposure to 
environmental agents and disease risk. Elucidating those mechanisms underlying these complex interactions will enable the 
development of effective prevention and intervention strategies to mitigate environmentally induced diseases.
RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
Basic Research 
 ▶ Identify pathways during critical life stages where the 
effects of dietary parameters will have the most pronounced 
effects on health outcomes. 
 ▶ Discover and explain how factors, including diet and 
medications along with the human microbiome, affect 
biological systems.
 ▶ Study how the environment, including nutrition, 
interacts with our genes through genetic and nongenetic 
mechanisms to help spur breakthroughs in precision 
health.  ▶ Use well-established animal models of environmentally 
induced disease to study the interaction of diet with 
environmental toxicants.
 ▶ Identify key molecular targets in relevant biologic pathways 
that could be useful in prevention and intervention studies.
 ▶ Study co-exposures related to food and nutrition to develop 
novel technological and quantitative approaches to prevent 
or intervene in adverse health impacts.
Applied Research 
 ▶ Expand existing studies to look at the interplay between diet 
and health outcomes, including secondary data analysis in 
ongoing studies.
 ▶ Encourage studies to test or develop novel tools or methods 
of exposure assessment for future studies that will look at 
diet and environment.
 ▶ Refine and validate dietary assessments for exposure in 
subpopulations. ▶ Add new environmental measures or assays to existing 
dietary studies.
 ▶ Develop new analytical methods or models to incorporate 
multiple layers of data (diet and environment).
 ▶ Assess the joint action of multiple environmental insults, 
including nutritional components, on toxicity and disease, 
and identify interactions resulting from combined 
exposures.56
NIH NUTRITION RESEARCH REPORT 2020 –2021 ▶ Continue promoting environment and nutrition research 
findings to networks of scientists, community advocates, 
educators, health care providers, and public health officials.

OVERVIEW
The principal mission of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) is to support fundamental research that 
undergirds all biomedical investigations. The major focus of the institute is on research concerned with expanding knowledge of 
fundamental biological structure and function at the cellular and molecular levels. Extramural studies supported by the institute 
include investigations in the biophysical sciences and the physiological sciences, in particular the response of the whole body to 
trauma; the structure and function of the cell; the basic mechanisms of heredity; and the molecular aspects of the interactions 
between therapeutic drugs and agents and their target cells, tissues, or organs. 
The majority of the nutrition-related research supported by NIGMS is in its trauma and burn injury program area, which focuses 
on the mechanisms involved in the body’s systemic responses to trauma. Thus, research on the role of nutrition in decreasing 
morbidity rates and morbidity for patients who suffer serious trauma or burn injury is of significant interest to the institute. 
NIGMS-supported scientists are exploring nutritional requirements following severe trauma and sepsis, new concepts in 
parenteral therapy, branched-chain amino acid feeding during injury, and cellular function during septic and hemorrhagic shock. 
In addition, studies are being supported that are investigating the cellular changes and mechanisms responsible for the protein 
wasting associated with nutritional deprivation. 
RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
The following areas of basic research on diseases and traumatic injury are being investigated:
 ▶ The role of diet in organ and cellular responses to cytokines
 ▶ Changes in metabolic patterns and nutritional 
requirements following severe injury
 ▶ Hormonal imbalance following injury and its effects on 
metabolism
 ▶ Mechanisms involved in producing a protein catabolic state 
after injury
 ▶ Adaptive regulation of nutrient transport by the gut; 
transport appears to be governed by nutrient-receptor 
proteins on specific cell surfaces
 ▶ Mechanism of suppression of lipoprotein lipase activity by 
tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
 ▶ Determining components of the host defense system 
(neutrophils, immunomodulators, etc.) that are important 
in preventing bacterial translocation ▶ Identifying receptors that recognize serum proteins 
carrying galactosyl sugar residues, including hormones 
that regulate the rate and extent of nutrient uptake and 
processing in the liver
 ▶ Interactions between and regulation of arginine, citrulline, 
ornithine, and urea metabolism following trauma or sepsis
 ▶ Effect of diet on gut microbiome diversity and immune 
regulation in surgical injury/infection recovery
Research supported by NIGMS serves to establish the 
foundation of new knowledge needed to make advances in 
the understanding of biological processes and many diseases. 
Those investigations that are nutrition-related will help to 
provide the concepts and relevant information necessary to 
develop new treatments, particularly in the area of traumatic 
injury, and thus serve to decrease morbidity and mortality.

OVERVIEW 
Created in 1946, the mission of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is to transform the understanding and treatment of 
mental illnesses through basic and clinical research, paving the way for prevention, recovery, and cure. NIMH supports biomedical 
and behavioral research, health services research, research training, and health information dissemination with respect to the 
causes, diagnosis, treatment, management, and prevention of mental illnesses. As mental health is an important part of overall 
health, NIMH invests in research on adaptive and maladaptive behaviors to better understand mental function and dysfunction.
RESEARCH DIRECTIONS 
NIMH encourages and supports a variety of nutrition-related 
research areas and projects in human and animal subjects. 
Examples of NIMH-funded research and areas of interest 
relevant to nutrition include the following:
 ▶ Exploring the role of the gut microbiome in such mental 
health conditions as anorexia nervosa, early-life trauma, 
and depression.
 ▶ Examining the effect of brain metabolic abnormalities on 
cognitive function and illness trajectory among individuals 
at clinical high risk for psychosis.
 ▶ Using continuous glucose monitoring to detect and 
intervene on risk and maintenance factors associated with 
binge-eating psychopathology.
 ▶ Using remote active and passive data collection 
technologies and advanced analytic techniques to identify 
patterns that signal an impending binge or purge episode in 
individuals with bulimia nervosa or binge-eating disorder. By identifying high-risk states, this research has the 
potential to lay the foundation for personalized precision 
treatment by alerting and intervening in individuals with 
eating disorders before an unhealthy behavior, such as 
binge eating or purging, occurs.
 ▶ Understanding how omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic 
acid (DHA) traverses the blood–brain barrier to enter the 
brain. This research is valuable from a basic physiological 
and biophysical perspective, and it has the potential to aid 
drug delivery to the brain.
 ▶ Exploring the effects of maternal obesity and poor antenatal 
nutrition on offspring cognition, emotion regulation, and 
risk for neurodevelopmental disorders.
 ▶ Testing dietary interventions for people with serious mental 
illness who are overweight or obese to produce clinically 
significant weight loss and reduce cardiometabolic risk.

Nutrition Research Spending for Fiscal Year 2021 (FY21) $44,085,247

OVERVIEW
Many populations in America—whether defined by race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, immigrant status, disability, sex, gender, 
or geography—experience higher rates of certain diseases and deaths than the general population. Although the diversity of the 
American population is one of the nation’s greatest assets, one of its greatest challenges is reducing the profound disparity in 
health status of its racial and ethnic minority, underserved rural, socioeconomically disadvantaged, and other populations who 
experience poor health outcomes.
The National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) has been a leader in increasing the scientific 
community’s focus on behavioral, biologic, and environmental factors, including socioeconomics, policies, structural 
discrimination, culture, and structural social determinants related to health disparities. NIMHD invests in research and fosters 
collaborations and partnerships to support evidence-based science to inform practice and policy. Its programs and initiatives 
provide a leading edge in enhancing the scientific knowledge base and designing interventions to improve health outcomes to 
reduce, and ultimately eliminate, health disparities.
Over the last three decades, the overall health of the nation has improved significantly. However, racial and ethnic minority, less-
privileged socioeconomic status (SES), sexual and gender minority, and underserved rural populations continue to experience 
a disproportionate burden of illness, disability, and premature death. Poor nutrition can affect people for a lifetime and may 
contribute to health disparities across many populations. Health disparities in CVD, cancer, infant mortality, obesity-associated 
outcomes, asthma, diabetes, and stroke all may be affected by nutrition.
The prevalence of many chronic diseases—including diabetes, hypertension, CVD, and certain cancers—experienced by African 
American or Black populations, American Indian and Alaska Native populations, Asian American populations, Native Hawaiian 
and Pacific Islander populations, and Hispanic or Latino populations is substantially greater than the prevalence of these diseases 
in white populations. Nutrition and diet-related behaviors also influence these conditions. Neighborhood and other social factors 
that sustain the existence of food deserts in low-income communities reduce access to food sources that can promote healthier 
eating. The socioeconomic, environmental, cultural, and structural differences that exist between racial and ethnic minorities 
and white populations perpetuate these nutrition-related health disparities. Conducting further research to enhance insights into 
the health determinants associated with these disparities can advance understanding and development of culturally appropriate 
solutions for these nutrition-related health disparities.
RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
NIMHD supports nutrition research that investigates the causes, treatment, and prevention of diseases disproportionately 
affecting populations who experience health disparities. The following are selected examples of NIMHD’s nutrition-related 
projects supported during FY20 and FY21.
Addressing the COVID-19 Pandemic
Good Bowls: Empowering Communities to Achieve Good 
Food Access and Health Equity: Emerging data indicate that 
those with preexisting health conditions—such as obesity, 
diabetes, and heart disease—are at significantly increased risk 
of contracting COVID-19, as are individuals of less-privileged 
SES and racial and ethnic minority backgrounds. Research also suggests that food insecurity (i.e., the disruption of food 
intake or eating patterns because of lack of resources) and 
poor dietary intake are likely contributors to health disparities 
in these populations. This research will focus on tailoring the 
production and distribution of healthy, affordable, locally 
produced, good-tasting frozen meals to low-income and 60
NIH NUTRITION RESEARCH REPORT 2020 –2021minority populations in small towns and rural communities, 
while also providing economic opportunities for small 
businesses in rural communities, for application in current 
COVID-19-impacted regional economies and business 
environments. The goal is to assist in minimizing the health, 
financial, and social impacts of the pandemic on populations 
who experience health disparities. (3R41MD014075-01S1)
The ADELANTE Trial: Testing a Multilevel Approach for 
Improving Household Food Insecurity and Glycemic Control 
Among Latinos With Diabetes:  Hispanic or Latino individuals 
account for the largest share of COVID-19 cases (60 percent) 
and deaths (48 percent) compared to any other racial or ethnic 
group in California. Additionally, Hispanic or Latino households 
have experienced a dramatic increase in household food 
insecurity due to the pandemic. This is especially distressing 
for Hispanic or Latino individuals with type 2 diabetes because 
household food insecurity is associated with worse glycemic 
control during the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal of this study 
is to determine whether a multilevel intervention to improve 
household food security and glycemic control is effective 
for Hispanic or Latino patients with diabetes. Investigators 
will use a type 1 hybrid trial to assess the effectiveness of the 
multilevel intervention on the primary outcome of glycemic 
control (HbA1c) at 6 months. Participants will be randomized to either 12 weeks of household deliveries of fiber-rich foods or a 
waitlist control arm, receiving the intervention after a 6-month 
delay. Investigators will follow participants and will assess the 
primary outcome of HbA1c at 6 months, as well as such key 
secondary outcomes as HbA1c at 12 months and diabetes and 
COVID-related stress at 6 and 12 months. (1R01MD016738-01)
Complex Systems Approaches to Identify Policy Levers 
to Reduce Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Diet and Obesity in 
Cities: Researchers will systematically engage local policy, 
community, and academic stakeholders to develop and refine 
a dynamic conceptual framework that elucidates drivers of 
racial/ethnic disparities in diet in cities. Also, an agent-based 
simulation model will be implemented to examine how high 
levels of racial/ethnic residential segregation in U.S. cities, 
the inequitable distribution of food outlets, pervasive income 
inequality, and the lower price of energy-dense, non-nutritious 
foods relative to healthier foods work in combination to 
constrain healthy food choices of racial/ethnic minorities and 
lead to disparities in diet and obesity. Researchers will use 
the model to evaluate how inequitable job and income loss 
due to the COVID-19 pandemic will affect diet disparities, and 
how multiscale federal, state, and local policies can either 
exacerbate or reduce disparities. (1R01MD015107-01A1)
Mechanisms and Risk Factors
Maternal Acculturation in Pregnancy and Infant Adiposity 
in Mexican Americans: This research addresses childhood 
obesity in the Mexican American population. Epidemiologic 
observations have consistently documented that individuals 
of Mexican origin living in the United States exhibit a 
progressive and pronounced decline in health over time 
and across generations, warranting considerable concern. 
The reason for this decline, particularly across generations, 
is not well understood. This research is studying the cause 
of intergenerational escalation in obesity among Mexican 
Americans and whether it begins during the intrauterine 
period of life. At this time, maternal acculturation-related 
processes may impact fetal development to produce 
phenotypic alterations in the structure and function of cells, 
tissues and organ systems that increase susceptibility for 
obesity/adiposity. Findings may provide new avenues for 
early identification of at-risk individuals and directions for 
the development and testing of prevention and intervention 
strategies. (5R01MD010738-05)
The COMIDITA Study: Urban Latino Toddlers, Diet Intake, and 
Developmental Outcomes:  Children of recently immigrated 
Latinos are at increased risk for exposure to multiple social 
and environmental factors that also contribute to inadequate nutrient intake, disadvantaging their development. Folate, a 
key methyl donor critical for DNA synthesis, methylation, and 
neurodevelopment, can be ingested as naturally occurring 
food folate or as synthetic folic acid (FA), present in fortified 
grains and vitamin supplements. Cost and convenience lead 
to a predominance of fortified foods in accessible staples for 
poor Latino immigrants. In rodent pups, a postnatal diet of 
insufficient folate impairs normal neurodevelopment, and 
diets with excess FA impair short-term memory and behavior. 
In adult humans, excess FA intake exacerbates memory loss 
and detrimental cognitive effects of vitamin B12 deficiency. 
Data examining toddler folate intake and cognition are limited. 
This research examines whether deficient folate or high folic 
acid intake at age 24 months lead to poorer cognitive and 
behavioral test scores at ages 30 and 36 months in children of 
poor urban Hispanic or Latino immigrants who attend Early 
Head Start. (5R21MD013622-02)
Role of Pregnane X Receptor in Diet-Induced Obesity and 
Metabolic Syndrome:  Research has shown that the nuclear 
receptor pregnane X receptor (PXR) is involved in the 
development of obesity and type 2 diabetes, two complex 
diseases that disproportionately affect African Americans. This 
study will explore whether PXR gene variants most common 61
NIH NUTRITION RESEARCH REPORT 2020 –2021among African Americans can be linked to obesity and type 
2 diabetes and identify the mechanisms linking PXR to these 
diseases. Data from this study will help to identify treatment 
targets for obesity and type 2 diabetes. (5U54MD012392-04)
The Influence of Structural Violence and Individual 
Behavior and Health on the Gut Microbiome and Colorectal 
Cancer Risk: Among all racial and ethnic groups, African 
Americans exhibit the highest colorectal cancer incidence and 
mortality, for reasons that remain poorly understood. The gut 
microbiome is emerging as a significant contributor to host 
health and disease. How social determinants interact with 
individual factors to influence the gut microbiome may be 
key to understanding racial and ethnic variation in colorectal 
cancer. This study examines whether exposure to structural 
violence increases psychosocial and physical vulnerability 
(e.g., anxiety/stress), compounded by one’s behavior (e.g., 
diet), which interacts with the gut microbiome to result in 
colorectal cancer health inequality in urban African Americans. 
(5U54MD012523-04)
The Bariatric Experience Long Term (BELONG) II for Racial 
and Ethnic Minority Patients: When compared to diet and 
exercise, bariatric surgery results in much higher weight loss 
over a period of 24 months (75 percent vs. 11 percent). Racial 
and ethnic minorities lose less weight following bariatric 
surgery than whites. Researchers propose to determine how 
environmental (social, physical) factors, health care system 
factors, patient psychosocial and behavioral factors, and 
health status contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in 
bariatric weight loss and regain after five years. The goal is 
to understand weight loss and regain for different races and 
ethnicities five years after surgery. Results will help design patient-centered, culturally appropriate postoperative care 
programs so that all patients achieve the maximum benefits 
from this highly effective treatment. (5R01MD013874-02)
Influence of Dietary Pattern and Race on Metabolic and 
Epigenetic Alterations Associated With Cancer Development: 
Dietary patterns impact the metabolome and consequently 
inflammation, possibly regulating cancer development 
through alterations in the DNA methylome. This research will 
examine the independent and combined influences of dietary 
pattern (vegetarian vs. omnivorous) and race on metabolic 
and epigenetic alterations, and subsequently, metabolite-
methylation associations among healthy participants of the 
Adventist Health Study-2 cohort. This study will elucidate the 
role of dietary patterns in cancer disparities and, ultimately, 
foster the development of effective interventions for cancer 
prevention. (1K01MD015194-01A1)
Reduction of Risk Factors for Obesity and Linked Chronic 
Diseases in Native American Employees of the Twin Arrows 
Casino: Obesity and related diseases present a health crisis 
among American Indian and Alaska Native populations, of 
whom 42% are obese and 19.4% have diabetes. Previous studies 
have shown that a micronutrient-dense, plant-rich (mNDPR) 
dietary program significantly decreased risk factors for obesity, 
related chronic diseases, and health care expenditures in 
multiethnic individuals. This study aims to provide education 
and exposure to a culturally relevant micronutrient-dense, 
plant-rich dietary program, with a goal of significantly 
decreasing risk factors for obesity and related diseases, as well 
as reducing health care costs, among American Indian and 
Alaska Native employees. (1R15MD015381-01A1)
Intervention and Translation Research
Developing a Lifestyle Intervention to Reduce Body Weight 
for Obese African American Men Living in the Rural South: 
Interventions are needed to address the prevalence of obesity 
and many obesogenic behaviors among adults living in rural 
compared to urban areas of the United States. Evidence 
indicates that men are less motivated than women to lose 
weight, and these disparities are particularly pronounced for 
rural African American men, who are largely underrepresented 
in behavioral weight loss trials in the rural South. This research 
will show that the theoretically based behavioral weight loss 
intervention will effectively attract, retain, and motivate 
rural African American men to engage in healthy weight loss 
behaviors. (5K23MD013899-03)A Gender and Culturally Specific Approach to Reduce Non-
Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) in Mexican American 
Men: Rates of NAFLD, a modifiable premalignant state 
associated with hepatocellular carcinoma are highest in the 
nation for Mexican American men. This grant will support 
training and research that will utilize a NAFLD-specific 
weight loss intervention to reduce the burden of NAFLD 
and improve health outcomes for Mexican American men. 
(1K01MD014761-01)
Early Life Social, Environmental, and Nutritional 
Determinants of Disease (ELSEND): Hispanic or Latino 
individuals are disproportionately affected by multiple chronic 
diseases that begin in early life, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, 
and NAFLD. Understanding and eliminating these disparities is 62
NIH NUTRITION RESEARCH REPORT 2020 –2021a national priority given the clinical and public health burden 
associated with these coexisting chronic diseases. Researchers 
will examine the contributions of early-life nutrition, exposure to environmental toxins, and social determinants of health on 
subclinical markers of chronic disease risk at 5 years of age 
among Hispanic or Latino children. (1P50MD017344-01)
Prevention
Intervention to Promote Physical Activation and Improve 
Sleep and Feeding Practices in Infants for Preventing Obesity 
Early in Life (The Baby-Act Trial):  Infant obesity is increasing 
in the United States, particularly among Hispanics and 
Latinos. Rapid weight gain during critical periods of infancy 
increases the risk of obesity in childhood, continuing into 
adulthood and increasing the risk of such chronic diseases as 
diabetes and hypertension. This serious health threat could be 
prevented through multifaceted interventions during infancy 
that address multiple risk factors related to physical activity, 
sleep, nutrition, satiety, and stress and increasing parenting 
skills associated with early obesity development. The long-
term goal of this project is to prevent infant obesity through 
a structured curriculum that provides a combination of key messages and activities designed to promote sound parenting 
skills that support and sustain healthy lifestyle. The proposed 
intervention is an integrated novel approach leveraging 
current Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, 
Infants, and Children (WIC) outreach practices and technology 
for complementing the current standard of care of the WIC 
Program. The investigators will assess the clinical effectiveness 
of this novel complementary intervention among caregivers 
of infants (0 and 12 months) who are participants of the Puerto 
Rico WIC program through a cluster-randomized controlled 
trial in 20 WIC clinics located within the San Juan Metropolitan 
Area of Puerto Rico. The research plan also includes a detailed 
evaluation of the cost of the intervention as a modification of 
the current WIC curriculum. (5U54MD007600-34)
Nutrition Education/Outreach
Osage Community Supported Agriculture Study: American 
Indians have limited access to healthy food and a high 
prevalence of diet-related diseases. This study will implement 
a Tribal community–supported agriculture program in which 
American Indian adults receive a weekly box of local fresh 
fruits and vegetables, along with culturally tailored nutrition 
and cooking education. The program’s effect on diet and health 
outcomes and its cost-effectiveness will be evaluated, and 
study processes and findings will be broadly disseminated to 
support Tribes in improving diet and health. (1R01MD016191-01)
Food Prescriptions to Promote Affordable Diets That Meet 
Recommended Dietary Allowances Among Multigenerational 
Latino Households: Hispanic or Latino families are 
disproportionately affected by obesity, type 2 diabetes, NAFLD, 
and dyslipidemia. Diet is a major contributing factor, and poor 
diet is heavily driven by environmental cues. This is especially 
true in low-income neighborhoods where marketing and 
availability of unhealthy foods is more salient. One promising 
approach to address these nutritional, social, and economic 
contributors to disparities in chronic disease risk is food prescriptions. This study will test the effects of a culturally 
sensitive meal planning and affordable grocery delivery service 
in a randomized controlled trial to improve diet quality, weight 
control and chronic disease risk among multigenerational 
Hispanic or Latino households. If this approach proves 
effective, food prescriptions could provide a scalable and 
sustainable model to improve diet, health, and well-being in 
Hispanic or Latino families. (1P50MD017344-01)
Evaluation of a Comprehensive School Nutrition Enrichment 
Intervention (CSNEI) in Rural School Districts: Rural 
populations and persons living in low-income households 
have high rates of obesity. The greatest disparities in obesity 
prevalence between urban and rural counties are in the 
southern United States. This research will evaluate a CSNEI in 
rural schools. The study explores heterogeneity of treatment 
effects for race and ethnicity, sex, age, and economic status to 
understand effects on populations most at risk for obesity. This 
study will fill critical gaps in evidence by rigorously evaluating 
a CSNEI in rural schools with high proportions of students 
eligible for free and reduced-price meals. (1P50MD017319-01)
FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES
During this reporting period (FY20 and FY21), the following funding opportunities related to nutrition/diet were offered by NIMHD.
Comprehensive Care for Adults With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 
From Populations With Health Disparities:  The purpose of 
this funding opportunity announcement (FOA) is to support 
innovative multidisciplinary, investigative, and collaborative research focused on developing and testing multilevel or 
multicomponent strategies, including models of health care, 
that effectively adapt and implement recommended guidelines 
of comprehensive clinical care for individuals with type 2 63
NIH NUTRITION RESEARCH REPORT 2020 –2021diabetes from populations with health disparities. One of the 
specific areas of interest included was food insecurity, a core 
area in the social determinants of health discussed in the 
PhenX toolkit. (FOA#: PA-21-232)
Administrative Supplements for Research on Dietary 
Supplements : This administrative supplement program is 
designed to provide supplemental funds to relevant, active, 
NIH-supported research projects to incorporate dietary 
supplement research that is within the scope of the parent 
project. Research interests of the Office of Dietary Supplements 
(ODS) are not limited to specific health conditions, organ 
systems, or population groups. ODS supports all types of 
research, including preclinical, clinical, behavioral, and epidemiological. Additionally, ODS supports research that 
builds future research capacity for studying the role of dietary 
supplements in health and disease prevention. Primary 
consideration for support will be given to applications that 
stimulate dietary supplement research where it is lacking 
or lagging, clarify gaps, opportunities, and balance between 
benefits and risks where data are in conflict, emphasize 
special population groups for whom additional science 
on supplements is needed, and focus on the use of dietary 
supplements in improving or maintaining health and reducing 
the risk of chronic disease. ODS is particularly interested in 
human studies. (FOA#: PA-20-227)
SCIENCE ADVANCES
The following are examples of science advances on nutritional or dietary related topics by programs funded by NIMHD during 
FY20 and FY21.
Psychosocial Factors of Diet and Physical Activity Among 
Rural, Hispanic Children: Findings From a Multilevel Health 
Intervention Study: The objective of this research is to examine 
the relationship of psychosocial factors—such as self-efficacy, 
family role modeling, and perceptions of the environment—on 
diet, physical activity, and sedentary behavior in Hispanic or 
Latino children living in rural Washington state. A subsample of 
179 children provided psychosocial measures, diet, and screen 
time via questionnaire and physical activity via accelerometer. 
Body mass index percentiles were used to calculate the 
prevalence of obesity. Prevalence of obesity was 35 percent. 
Children with obesity consumed one-fifth fewer cups of fruits, 
2.2 more teaspoons of total added sugars, and spent 16.1 fewer 
minutes in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per day 
than children with healthy weights. Higher fruit and vegetable 
self-efficacy scores were associated with more consumption 
of fruits and vegetables, more engagement in light physical 
activity, and less time spent sedentary per day. Insight about 
factors associated with obesity-related behaviors in rural, 
Hispanic children may help the development of successful and 
effective behavioral health interventions for this understudied 
population.

Cost-Effectiveness of Nutrition Policies on Processed 
Meat: Implications for Cancer Burden in the United States:  
Processed meats are associated with increased risk of 
colorectal and stomach cancers, but health and economic 
impacts of policies to discourage processed meats are not well 
established. This study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness 
of implementing tax and warning labels on processed meats. 
A probabilistic cohort-state transition model was developed 
in 2018, including lifetime and short-term horizons, health care, and societal perspectives, and 3 percent discount rates 
for costs and health outcomes. The model simulated 32 
subgroups by age, gender, and race/ethnicity from the U.S. adult 
population and integrated nationally representative 2011–2014 
data on processed meat consumption. In subgroup analyses, 
greater health and economic benefits accrued to younger 
subpopulations, subpopulations with greater cancer risk, and 
those with higher baseline processed meat consumption. 
The model shows that implementing tax or warning labels 
on processed meats would be a cost-saving strategy with 
substantial health and economic benefits. The findings should 
encourage policymakers to consider nutrition-related policies 
to reduce cancer burden.

Machine Learning With Sparse Nutrition Data to Improve 
Cardiovascular Mortality Risk Prediction in the United States 
Using Nationally Randomly Sampled Data: In this study, 
researchers aimed to test whether adding nutrition predictor 
variables or using machine-learning models improves 
cardiovascular death prediction versus standard Cox models 
without nutrition predictor variables. In a retrospective study, 
six waves of NHANES data were collected from 1999 to 2011 
and linked to the National Death Index (NDI). The study sample 
was approximately 20 percent Black or African American 
and 25 percent Hispanic or Latino. Primary and secondary 
outcome measures were time from NHANES interview until 
the minimum of time of cardiovascular death or censoring. A 
standard risk model excluding nutrition data overestimated 
risk nearly twofold with moderate discrimination. Nutrition 
data alone failed to improve performance, and machine 
learning alone improved calibration to 1.18 and discrimination 
to 0.91. Results indicate that the inclusion of nutrition data 64
NIH NUTRITION RESEARCH REPORT 2020 –2021with available machine learning algorithms can substantially 
improve cardiovascular risk prediction.  
PMID:  31784446  Grant support #: DP2 MD010478
Development and Application of a Total Diet Quality Index for 
Toddlers: This study aimed to create a diet quality index based 
on a scoring system for ages 12 to 23.9 months, the Toddler Diet 
Quality Index (DQI), and evaluate its construct validity using 
24-hour dietary recall data collected from a national sample 
of children from the Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study (FITS) 
2016. The mean Toddler DQI was 49 out of 100 possible points, 
indicating room for improvement. Toddlers under-consumed 
seafood, greens, beans, and plant proteins and over-consumed 
refined grains and added sugars. Toddler DQI scores were 
higher among children who were ever breastfed, lived in 
households with higher incomes, and who were Hispanic. The 
Toddler DQI performed as expected and offers a measurement 
tool to assess the dietary quality of young children in 
accordance with federal nutrition guidelines. This is important 
for providing guidance that can be used to inform public health 
nutrition policies, programs, and practices to improve diets of 
young children.

Association of Magnesium Intake and Vitamin D Status 
With Cognitive Function in Older Adults: An Analysis of U.S. 
NHANES 2011 to 2014: Reduced cognitive function associated 
with aging has gained increasing attention as the U.S. 
population ages. Magnesium plays a critical role in vitamin D 
biosynthesis and metabolism, and deficiencies in magnesium 
and vitamin D show associations with poor cognition. However, 
no study has examined their interaction. This study aimed to 
evaluate the associations of magnesium intake and serum 
25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations, indicating 
vitamin D status, with cognition, and interaction between these 
nutrients in older adults. Based on the NHANES 2011–2014, 
the study included 2,466 participants age 60 or older who 
completed the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). Higher 
total magnesium intake was independently associated with 
higher DSST scores. The association of total magnesium intake 
with high DSST score was primarily observed among women, 
white individuals, physically active participants, and those with 
sufficient vitamin D status, although the interactions were not 
significant. Findings suggest that high magnesium intake alone 
may improve DSST scores in older adults, and the association 
may be stronger among subjects with sufficient vitamin D 
status.  
PMID: 32388734  Grant Support #: U54MD006882COVID-19-Related Food Insecurity Among Households With 
Dietary Restrictions: A National Survey: Food insecurity 
increased because of the COVID-19 pandemic; however, 
little is known about pandemic-related food insecurity in 
households with dietary restrictions. This study aims to 
examine pre-pandemic rates and pandemic-related change 
in food insecurity among households with and without 
dietary restrictions such as food allergies or celiac disease. 
Pre-pandemic food insecurity and early pandemic-related 
change in food insecurity were assessed using the adapted 
Hunger Vital Sign. Weighted, multivariate logistic regression 
was used to model the odds of pre-pandemic food insecurity 
and the odds of incident or worsening pandemic-related 
food insecurity among households with and without dietary 
restrictions. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, households 
with self-reported food allergy, celiac disease, or both were 
significantly more likely to be food insecure than households 
without restrictions. Households with dietary restrictions 
were also significantly more likely to experience incident or 
worsening food insecurity during the early pandemic. Race/
ethnicity was not a significant moderator of the relationship 
between dietary restrictions and pandemic-related food 
insecurity. Households with dietary restrictions were more 
likely to experience both pre-pandemic and pandemic-related 
incident or worsening food insecurity than households without 
restrictions. Clinical care for patients with dietary restrictions 
requires attention to food insecurity.

The Early Effects of Cumulative and Individual Adverse 
Childhood Experiences on Child Diet: Examining the Role 
of SES: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have been 
associated with detrimental long-term health outcomes, 
including obesity risk. Existing research has yet to examine 
whether early life ACEs are associated with diet in early 
childhood within socioeconomic subgroups. For this study, data 
were drawn from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-
Birth Cohort (2001–2002). Mother-child dyads were recruited 
when children were 9 months old and followed longitudinally 
at 2 years and 4 years. Mothers reported children’s exposure to 
five ACEs at 9 months and 2 years and children’s daily intake 
of fruits, vegetables, sweet snacks, and sugar-sweetened 
beverages at 4 years. Results provide preliminary evidence on 
the association between cumulative and specific ACEs and 
child diet, and how this relationship varies by SES context. 
Future research is needed to understand the complex 
multilevel mechanisms operating along this pathway to 65
NIH NUTRITION RESEARCH REPORT 2020 –2021inform interventions supporting behavior change and to build 
evidence for policies that may reduce diet-related disparities in 
ACE exposure.

OVERVIEW
Created in 1950, the mission of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is to seek fundamental 
knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease. NINDS 
conducts, fosters, coordinates, and guides basic, translational, and clinical neuroscience research on the causes, prevention, 
diagnosis, and treatment of neurological disorders and stroke. NINDS also funds training and career development programs to 
nurture a talented and diverse neuroscience research workforce and communicates scientific discoveries and their implications 
for neurological health to the public, health professionals, researchers, and policymakers.
RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
Rapid and recent progress in brain research has yielded new understanding of the interaction between nutrition and the nervous 
system. In FY20, about 90 projects supported by NINDS were categorized as nutrition research projects. Many of these projects are 
mechanistic studies that investigate the role of nutrients or metabolic processes in neurological conditions or in healthy neurons 
with the goal of discovering novel therapeutic targets for neurological disorders. Major areas of research and highlights of NINDS-
supported nutrition research during FY20 and FY21 include the following:
 ▶ Basic research studies that examine the role of nutrients in 
brain health and development and a variety of neurological 
disorders and brain injury, including cerebrovascular 
disease, cerebellar ataxia, multiple sclerosis, and traumatic 
brain injuries
 ▶ Mechanistic studies that investigate metabolic processes to 
better understand how cellular energy metabolism affects 
brain function, with the goal of identifying novel therapeutic 
approaches for neurological diseases
 ▶ Translational research studies that test dietary 
interventions or metabolic pathway–targeting molecules 
in animal models of neurological diseases, including pain 
conditions, ischemic stroke, Huntington’s disease, neural 
tube defects, and epilepsy
 ▶ Studies that explore the role of the gut microbiome in 
Parkinson’s disease, brain injuries, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, and central nervous system autoimmunity 
and aim to understand how the gut microbiome—often 
influenced by nutrition and diet—may modulate the 
immune system and neural function
 ▶ Mechanistic studies that examine how altered metabolism 
or obesity may contribute to impaired neural function, 
including projects that aim to understand molecular 
mechanisms underlying obesity-related memory deficits 
and obesity-induced remodeling of the brain vasculature
 ▶ Research projects focused on comorbid conditions, such 
as stroke in obese individuals or stroke in individuals with 
metabolic syndrome
 ▶ A multidisciplinary clinical research project that is testing 
whether stimulation of the brain circuitry thought to be 
involved in loss-of-control eating may be an effective 
intervention strategy for binge eating

Nutrition is a topic of particular interest in NINR’s population and 
community health research and a key factor in improving health 
equity. The nutrition research portfolio at NINR spans the spectra 
of disease, populations, and the lifespan.
Recent examples of NINR research efforts in these areas include 
studies focused on the following activities:
 ▶ Addressing infant and child obesity through family- and 
community-based participatory research on culturally 
tailored interventions for healthy eating in underserved 
populations23
 ▶ Utilizing uniquely integrated nutrition and math curricula to 
improve food-buying behaviors of children in urban areas24
 ▶ Employing e-health and mHealth approaches to provide 
personalized dietary management of gestational weight 
in low-income mothers25 and in individuals with type 2 
diabetes26 and, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, adapt 
existing nutritional interventions provided by community-
based congregate meal programs to use in digital nutrition 
programs aimed at older adults who lack technological 
expertise27NINR has co-sponsored several nutrition-related FOAs to 
promote research into the development and testing of innovative 
interventions to reduce risk factors associated with nutrition. 
For example, NINR sponsored PA-18-776 , “Maternal Nutrition 
and Pre-Pregnancy Obesity: Effects on Mothers, Infants, and 
Children,” which encouraged R01 applications to improve health 
outcomes for women, infants, and children by stimulating 
interdisciplinary research focused on maternal nutrition and 
pre-pregnancy obesity. NINR also supported PA-18-355 , “Healthy 
Habits: Timing for Developing Sustainable Healthy Behaviors 
in Children and Adolescents,” which encouraged applications 
that employ innovative research to identify mechanisms of 
influence or promote positive sustainable health behavior(s) in 
children and youth (birth to age 21). Last, NINR supported PAR-
18-857 , “Diet and Physical Activity Assessment Methodology,” 
which encouraged innovative research to enhance the quality of 
measurements of dietary intake and physical activity. 
These studies highlight NINR’s long-term commitment to 
nutrition research that promotes community and population 
health and supports family- and community-based solutions to 
improve health outcomes and equity.68

NIH NUTRITION RESEARCH REPORT 2020 –2021OFFICE OF DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS
https://ods.od.nih.gov
Nutrition Research Spending for Fiscal Year 2021 (FY21) $8,766,181
OVERVIEW
The mission of the Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) at NIH is to strengthen knowledge and understanding of dietary 
supplements by evaluating scientific information; stimulating and supporting research; disseminating research results; and 
educating the public to foster an enhanced quality of life and health for the U.S. population.
Dietary supplements are widely used in the United States by people who want to maintain or improve their health or reduce their 
risk of illness. In 2020, Americans spent more than $56 billion on more than 80,000 products containing vitamins and minerals, 
herbs and botanicals, and other ingredients, such as glucosamine, fish oils, and probiotics.
The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994 defined dietary supplements as products intended to 
supplement the diet. DSHEA also established ODS at NIH in HHS; ODS began operations in November 1995; its acting director is 
Joseph M. Betz, Ph.D.
Scientists are studying dietary supplements to determine their value in maintaining good health. ODS supports this research 
to assess the benefits and risks of dietary supplements and communicates the results of this research to scientists, health 
professionals, and consumers.
EXAMPLES OF ODS ACTIVITIES
Research Support
The majority of the ODS budget supports research on dietary 
supplements in collaboration with many NIH ICs. For FY21, 
ODS provided $10.6 million in co-funding 61 grants across 
12 NIH ICs. Since its inception, ODS has funded hundreds of 
conferences, workshops, and meetings on dietary supplements 
that help inform and direct research efforts for ODS and 
NIH. Further information is available on the ODS Grants and  
Funding  webpage. 
Centers for Advancing Research on Botanical and Other  
Natural Products (CARBON) Program : Since 1999, in 
partnership with NCCIH, ODS has funded multidisciplinary 
centers to study the health effects of botanicals at academic 
research institutions across the United States. These centers 
identify and characterize botanical ingredients; assess their 
biological activity and bioavailability; evaluate their effects 
in cells, animals, and people; help select botanicals to test in 
clinical trials; and provide a rich environment for training and 
career development. 
Analytical Methods and Reference Materials : More than 
80,000 dietary supplements are estimated to be available in 
the U.S. marketplace, but in many cases, reliable analytical 
methods are not available to assess the quality of their 
ingredients. This ODS initiative enhances collaborative effortsto develop and validate analytical methods and develop 
reference materials for commonly used dietary supplements. 
Training and Career Development:  ODS provides support for 
postdoctoral students and scientists at universities across 
the United States, as well as in government agencies. This 
program’s goal is to expand the number of well-qualified 
researchers who investigate dietary supplements, with an 
emphasis on training young investigators, minorities, and 
women. Program components include the  ODS Research  
Scholars Program  and the  Mary Frances Picciano Dietary  
Supplements Research Practicum . 
Population Studies Program : The Population Studies Program 
evaluates the use of dietary supplements by the U.S. population 
and specific population subgroups and the contributions that 
dietary supplements make to nutritional status. Research 
is focused on describing the use of dietary supplements, 
including specific supplements taken, amount consumed, 
and duration of use. This program uses data from nationally 
representative surveys and other large population-based 
studies to conduct research and characterize emerging issues, 
such as changing patterns in use of these products. Staff also 
lead efforts to address methodological issues in assessing 
dietary and dietary-supplement intakes in epidemiological and 
other large studies. Nutrition as Percentage of Total Office Obligations for FY21 32.3%70
NIH NUTRITION RESEARCH REPORT 2020 –2021Iodine Initiative : Iodine is an essential nutrient and a 
component of thyroid hormone. The iodine status (i.e., 
adequacy or deficiency) of populations and individuals varies 
with local geographic features, availability in the food supply, 
and use of fortified foods and dietary supplements. Although 
iodine deficiency is rare in the United States and Canada, it can 
have serious effects. ODS developed its Iodine Initiative in 2011 
in response to concerns that some pregnant women may have inadequate intakes of this nutrient at a time of high physiologic 
demand. Five workshops have provided ODS expert opinion 
on public health issues and research needs. ODS activities in 
iodine nutrition focus on supporting research, methodology 
development, and research-related resources that can provide 
a scientific base for understanding how best to improve iodine 
status in individuals with low to moderate risk of deficiency.  
Dietary Supplement Ingredient and Label Databases
 ▶ The Dietary Supplement Ingredient Database (DSID) , 
developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) 
Nutrient Data Laboratory in collaboration with ODS 
and other federal agencies, provides estimated levels of 
ingredients in dietary supplement products sold in the 
United States. The DSID is intended primarily for research 
applications. 
 ▶ The Dietary Supplement Label Database (DSLD) , a 
collaborative project of ODS and the National Library 
of Medicine,  contains information taken from the 
labels of approximately 100,000 dietary supplement products available in the U.S. marketplace. Each month 
approximately 1,000 labels are added to the DSLD. 
 ▶ The  Computer Access to Research on Dietary Supplements  
(CARDS)  database contains federally funded research 
projects pertaining to dietary supplements. Currently, 
CARDS contains projects funded by the ICs beginning with 
FY99, the first year that NIH ICs began reporting research 
related to dietary supplements. Projects funded by other 
federal agencies are added to CARDS as they become 
available; partial data from the USDA and the  
U.S. Department of Defense are available. 
Communications
ODS develops and disseminates information about the latest 
science on dietary supplements for a wide range of audiences, 
including researchers, health care providers, industry, and 
consumers. This information is provided through the ODS website, fact sheets, e newsletters, and staff presentations at 
professional and consumer-focused meetings, as well as the 
ODS listserv . 
Information Resources on Dietary Supplements
ODS makes accurate and up-to-date scientific information 
about dietary supplements available to researchers, health care 
providers, and the public, through the following resources:
 ▶ Dietary Supplement Fact Sheets : These overviews of dietary 
supplement ingredients (including vitamin D, omega-3 fatty 
acids, and weight-loss supplements) are written for varied 
audiences, including researchers, health care providers, 
and consumers. Consumer fact sheets are also available in 
Spanish.
 ▶ PubMed Dietary Supplement Subset : The subset is designed 
to limit search results to citations from a broad spectrum 
of dietary supplement literature including vitamin, mineral, phytochemical, ergogenic, botanical, and herbal 
supplements in human nutrition and animal models.
 ▶ CARDS : This searchable database provides information on 
federally funded research projects pertaining to dietary 
supplements.
 ▶ DSID : This database provides the amount of nutrients in 
some dietary supplements based on chemical analysis.
 ▶ DSLD : This database contains information taken from the 
labels of the dietary supplement products available in the 
U.S. marketplace.
ODS Newsletters
ODS distributes three electronic publications  through the ODS 
listserv:
 ▶ ODS Update, sent out periodically, includes news about ODS 
programs, staff publications and presentations, dietary 
supplement fact sheets, databases, meetings, and exhibits. ▶ The Scoop, a consumer-focused e-newsletter, is sent out 
several times a year. Each issue has a slightly different 
theme, such as multivitamins or dietary supplements and 
aging.
 ▶ ODS informs the listserv about timely announcements 
through the Special Supplement.71

NIH NUTRITION RESEARCH REPORT 2020 –2021Appendix A: NIH RePORT and RePORTER 
Search Methodology 
ABOUT NIH R ePORT AND NIH R ePORTER
In addition to carrying out its scientific mission, NIH 
exemplifies and promotes the highest level of public 
accountability. To that end, the RePORT website provides 
access to reports, data, and analyses of NIH research activities, 
including information on NIH expenditures and the results of 
NIH-supported research.
One tool available on the RePORT website is the RePORTER 
module. RePORTER is an electronic tool that allows users to 
search a repository of intramural and extramural NIH-funded 
research projects and access publications and patents resulting 
from NIH funding.
In addition to RePORTER, the RePORT website also contains 
other tools that provide access to reports and summary 
statistics on NIH funding and the organizations and 
researchers involved in NIH research and training. One tool 
is the NIH Data Book, which summarizes the most commonly 
asked questions about the NIH budget and extramural 
programs. Another tool is Awards by Location, which 
summarizes NIH awards for a particular fiscal year by the 
location and organization of the awardees.
As described in the NIH Reform Act of 2006, Congress requires 
NIH to report annual spending for more than 300 research, 
condition, and disease categories, including nutrition. 
Historically, projects related to nutrition were identified by 
staff in each of the institutes and centers (ICs). However, at the 
request of Congress, NIH developed an improved process to 
provide better consistency and transparency in the reporting 
of its funded research. In Fiscal Year 2008, NIH began using the 
Research, Condition, and Disease Categorization (RCDC) system 
to define the more than 300 categories for which NIH reports annual spending to Congress and the public. The RCDC uses 
sophisticated text data mining in conjunction with NIH-wide 
definitions to match projects to research spending categories.
The definitions (fingerprints) are a list of terms and concepts 
selected by NIH scientific experts to define a research category. 
The nutrition fingerprint was created by NIH staff and 
nutrition science experts representing several NIH ICs. It was 
developed based on the Interagency Committee on Human 
Nutrition Research’s definition of human nutrition research: 
the pursuit of new knowledge to improve the understanding of 
nutrition as it relates to human health and disease and, as here 
defined, encompasses studies in five major areas—biomedical 
and behavioral sciences, food sciences, nutrition monitoring 
and surveillance, nutrition education, and impact on nutrition 
and intervention programs and socioeconomic factors. The 
fingerprint is compared to each NIH-funded research project 
by searching titles, abstracts, and specific aims to generate 
a list of research projects related to nutrition. Because there 
is no reasonable way to assign a percentage of the project as 
relevant to nutrition, the dollars for all identified nutrition-
related projects are counted as 100 percent nutrition. Research 
projects may meet the criteria of multiple fingerprints, and 
most nutrition projects are categorized under other spending 
categories, as well. For example, a project that meets the 
criteria for the nutrition, obesity, and prevention fingerprints 
would be included in each of the respective RCDC categories, 
so adding the number of projects or dollars in each category 
would result in a number that far exceeds the total number of 
projects or dollars.
SEARCH METHODOLOGY
The RePORT  database was used to calculate total funding for 
Nutrition Research by NIH ICO using the Research, Condition, 
and Disease Categorization (RCDC) code “Nutrition” under 
Categorical Spending. “Categorical Spending displays the 
annual support level for various research, condition, and 
disease categories based on grants, contracts, and other 
funding mechanisms used across the NIH, as well as disease 
burden data.” 
Total funding in nutrition (nutrition research and training 
current dollars) restricted to Fiscal Years 2019, 2020, and 
2021 (FY19, FY20, FY21, respectively) was the sum of nutrition research and training current dollars plus subproject funding 
(Table 1 ). The total nutrition research and training in current 
dollars by NIH component for FY19, FY20, and FY21 is provided 
in Table 2 . Nutrition research and training in constant 
dollars was calculated using the Biomedical Research  and 
Development Price Index  (Table 1 ). Nutrition research and 
training in constant dollars for FY20 and FY21 was calculated 
by setting FY19 as 100 percent and taking this amount and 
dividing it by 1.017 and 1.039 for FY20 and FY21, respectively 
(Table 1 ). The actual total NIH obligations and IC obligations 
for FY19, FY20, and FY21 were obtained from the NIH Budget 74
NIH NUTRITION RESEARCH REPORT 2020 –2021Office Actual and Total Obligations by Institute and Center  
history tables  (Tables 1 and 3). Constant nutrition dollars as a 
percentage of actual total NIH obligations by fiscal year  
(Table 1 ) was calculated by taking the nutrition and research 
training constant dollars and dividing that value by actual total 
NIH obligations and multiplying the result by 100.
Figure 1  shows the percentage of nutrition research and 
training projects that overlap with other spending categories. 
The RePORTER  database was used to calculate the overlapping 
spending categories as a percentage of total funded projects 
in nutrition. The RCDC categories “nutrition” and “overlapping 
category” (e.g., prevention, obesity, cancer, microbiome) 
were used as Boolean terms to compute funding for those 
overlapping categories. The total number of projects is the sum of total funding plus subproject funding. Actual total NIH 
obligations were used to calculate the percentage of nutrition 
research and training current dollars, both for funding and 
number of projects. 
Nutrition funding percentage by NIH research mechanism 
(Figure 2 ) was computed using the RePORTER  tool and 
categorizing the search by funding mechanism. The RCDC 
term “nutrition” was used and restricted to FY19, FY20, and 
FY21. The training categories (individual and institutional) were 
grouped into a single “training” category, and other research-
related, Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business 
Technology Transfer, and interagency agreements were 
grouped into the “other” category.Appendix B76
