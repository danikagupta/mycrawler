Salvinia molesta , an aquatic fern was observed to have a potential of degrading azo dye Rubine GFL up to
97% at a concentration of 100 mg/L within 72 h using 60 72 g of root biomass. Both root as well as stem
tissues showed induction in activities of the enzymes such as lignin peroxidase, veratryl alcohol oxidase,
laccase, tyrosinase, catalase, DCIP reductase and superoxide dismutase during decolorization of Rubine
GFL. FTIR, GC-MS, HPLC and UV –visible spectrophotometric analysis con ﬁrmed phytotransformation of
the model dye into smaller molecules. Analysis of metabolites revealed breakdown of an azo bond of
Rubine GFL by the action of lignin peroxidase and laccase and formation of 2-methyl-4-nitroaniline and
N-methylbenzene-1, 4-diamine. Anatomical tracing of dye in the stem of S. molesta conﬁrmed the pre-
sence of dye in tissues and subsequent removal after 48 h of treatment. The concentration of chlorophyllpigments like chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotenoid was observed during the treatment. Toxicity
analysis on seeds of Triticum aestivum and Phaseolus mungo revealed the decreased toxicity of dye me-
tabolites. In situ treatment of a real textile ef ﬂuent was further monitored in a constructed lagoon of the
dimensions of 7 m /C25m/C22 m (total surface area 35 m
2) using S. molesta for 192 h. This large scale
treatment was found to signi ﬁcantly reduce the values of COD, BOD 5and ADMI by 76%, 82% and 81%
considering initial values 1185, 1440 mg/L and 950 units, respectively.

1. Introduction
One fourth of the Indian urban and suburban population is
presently engaged in textile industries which contribute about 25%of total foreign currency ( Goyal et al., 2009 ). Dye processors rou-
tinely use about 3500 different dyes, out of which, 84% is con-tributed by sulphonated azo dyes. Around 10 –15% of the total
wastewater is discharged to the environmental sink by these in-dustries ( Sarayu and Sandhya, 2009 ). Dye ef ﬂuents contain organic
compounds, metals, salts directly affect water color, chemicaloxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), totaldissolved solid (TDS), total suspended solid (TSS) and pH ( Kabra
et al., 2013 ). In most of the developing countries, many textile
industries are small scale and house hold whose treatment pro-cesses are less ef ﬁcient and releases the wastewater directly to
river and other natural water resources ( Rane et al., 2014 ). Thesewastewaters are highly toxic to the living beings like humans and
ﬂora and fauna of various habitats ( Sharma et al., 1999 ).
There are several physico-chemical methods like ﬁltration,
ﬂocculation, coagulation, adsorption, chemical oxidation, photo-
degradation designed for the treatment of textile ef ﬂuents con-
taining dyes. These processes are costly and less ef ﬁcient, produce
secondary waste materials and thus possess limitations in treating
efﬂuents with multiple types of dyes ( Kabra et al., 2013 ). Although,
color removal from the ef ﬂuent is achieved with these systems,
the toxicity of secondary waste remains a major threat. Therefore,
there is an urgent need to design unique systems which are costeffective, eco-friendly and ef ﬁcient in textile wastewater treat-
ment. Because of these reasons needs modern biological treatment
using microorganisms were tried for the treatment of wastewaterwhich also has shortcomings when on site administration is con-
cerned ( Khandare and Govindwar, 2015 ;Patil et al., 2016 ).
A number of reports on phytoremediation of textile dyes have
been published in the last decade describing the use of plants from
various habitats. However, the large scale demonstrations stillContents lists available at ScienceDirect

E-mail address: spgovindwar@rediffmail.com (S.P. Govindwar).Environmental Research 150 (2016) 88 –96remain scares. The present study deals with decolorization and
degradation of customarily used dye Rubine GFL, a simulated dye
mixture and a real textile ef ﬂuent by Salvinia molesta . Further, S.
molesta which is an aquatic fern, with dense root system spreading
over water was explored in a constructed lagoon for large scaletreatment. The treatment pond system can be controlled andplanted with aquatic vegetation to achieve effective dye removal.S. molesta , if grown once, it does not need to monitor in future for
its growth as it grows naturally. It is also known as kariba weedwhich belongs to the family Salviniaceae. It is native to south-eastern Brazil. The favourable condition for growth requires 20 –
30°C temperature and pH range in between 4 and 9. It can be
grown in high salt concentration ( Upadhyay and Panda, 2005 ).
Sesuvium portulacastrum , a halophyte was shown to treat Green
HE4B (50 mg/L) dye up to 70% ( Patil et al., 2012 ).S. molesta has a
potential to grow in dye containing water and requires less timeperiod for adaptation ( Sukumaran, 2013 ). Use of S. molesta was for
treatment of dye ef ﬂuents has earlier been successfully tried for
removal of heavy metals such as lead, arsenic and cadmium ( Su-
kumaran, 2013 ). Halophytic plants could be explored for treatment
of a variety of industrial ef ﬂuents.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Chemicals
2, 2-Azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline)-6-sulphonic acid
(ABTS) and ribo ﬂavin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St
Louis, MO, USA). 2, 6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCIP), nicoti-namide adenine dinucleotide (di-sodium salt), n-propanol, ca-techol and veratryl alcohol were bought from Sisco Research La-boratories, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. Tartaric acid was obtainedfrom BDH chemicals (Mumbai, Maharashtra, India). The textiledyes Rubine GFL, Remazol Black B, Red RBL were obtained fromMahesh dye processors, Ichalkaranji and ef ﬂuent was from CETP,
Kagal, Maharashtra, India. The seeds of T. aestivum (monocot )and
P. mungo (dicot) were purchased from a local grain market and S.
molesta plant was procured from wastewater creek Ambewadi,
Kolhapur, Maharashtra.
2.2. Decolorization studies with S. molesta
Well grown S. molesta plants with root biomass of 60 72gw a s
used for phytoremediation studies. The S. molesta plants roots
were carefully washed with running tap water and submerged in500 mL dye solutions in 1000 mL beaker. Dyes namely Rubine GFL,Remazol Black B, Red RBL, Bottle Green No.9, Navy Blue Rx andScarlet RR were used at concentration of 100 mg/L separately.
Similarly, plant were exposed to 500 mL of the simulated dye
mixture containing Rubine GFL, Remazol Black B and Red RBL at aconcentration of 100 mg/L. Aliquots of 2 mL were withdrawn fromdye solution at intervals of 12 h, over the period of 72 h. This ali-quot was centrifuged at 4561 /C2gfor 10 min to separate any solid
matter if present. The absorbance of the clear solution of RubineGFL was measured at its wavelength maxima of 530 nm using aspectrophotometer method. The percent of decolorization wascalculated using following equation.
%Decolorization ¼(Initial absorbance /C0Final absorbance/Initial
absorbance) /C2100.
2.3. Characterization of dye, dye mixture and textile ef ﬂuent
Rubine GFL, dye mixture and textile ef ﬂuent were characterized
by using parameters such as American Dye Manufactures In-stitutes (ADMI), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD
5), chemicaloxygen demand (COD), total suspended solid (TSS) and total dis-
solved solid (TDS) ( APHA, 1995 ) before and after treatment. Heavy
metals were estimated using Atomic Absorption Spectro-
photometer (Thermo ﬁsher AA203) ( Lindsay and Norvell, 1978 ).
BOD 5was estimated using following procedure of Winkler's io-
dometric method ( APHA, 1995 ). The sample was collected and
stored at 4 °C till used. Known diluted sample using distilled water
was transferred to the BOD bottle (300 mL). One mL each phos-
phate buffer, MgSO 4, CaCl 2and FeCl 3solution was added into di-
luted sample and mixed thoroughly. The sample was neutralized
to pH 7 by using 1N NaOH or H 2SO4. One set of BOD bottle was
incubated in BOD incubator at 20 °C for 5d. Other set was used to
determine the DO content at the same time. One mL of alkaline KI
and MnSO 4was added into diluted solution. 2 mL concentrated
H2SO4was added and stirred well to dissolve precipitate. Aliquot
of 50 mL sample was taken from BOD bottle into conical ﬂask to
titrate against sodium thiosulphate using starch as an indicator.
After 5d incubation, DO was measured using same procedure.
Distilled water was kept as blank. BOD was calculated using fol-
lowing formula.
BOD 5(mg/L) ¼(D0–D5)/C0(B0–B5)/C2dilution factor.
where, D 0–0 d DO, D 5–after 5 d DO, B 0–0 d blank and B 5–
after 5 d blank.
2.4. Anatomical studies of stem during dye degradation
The transverse sections of stem were taken at 12, 24, 36 and
48 h time interval after the exposure of Rubine GFL. Then these
sections were mounted in glycerine after overlaying with cover
slip and result were micro-photographed with a Zeiss Axio Imager
2 Upright Trinocular Microscope with attached camera at 100
magni ﬁcations ( Rane et al., 2014 ). The plants again transfer to
fresh water after 48 h experiment and were again studied anato-mical changes at 60 h.
2.5. Analysis of photosynthetic pigments
Five gram of each control and treated plants leaves were taken
in separate mortar and pestle. 50 mL of acetone (80%) was added
at the time of crushing along with a pinch of MgCO
3powder. After
crushing, extract was ﬁltered and then centrifuged at 2000 /C2gfor
10 min. For the estimation of chlorophyll content, absorbance of
supernatant was measured at wavelength 663 and 645 nm; while
carotenoids were estimated at 470 nm ( Arnon, 1949 ).
2.6. Preparation of crude extracts of root and stem tissue and en-
zyme assay
Two gram of each root and stem of S. molesta were excised and
cut into ﬁne pieces. They were then separately suspended in
50 mM potassium phosphate buffer of pH 7.4. The ﬁne pieces of
root and stem were crushed using a mortar and pestle, then
homogenized using glass homogenizer and centrifuged for 20 min
at 8481 /C2gat 4 °C. The obtained clear supernatant was used as an
enzyme source ( Kagalkar et al., 2009 ).
Activities of dye degrading enzymes like lignin peroxidase (LiP),
laccase, veratryl alcohol oxidase (VAO), tyrosinase, azo reductase,
DCIP reductase, catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and ribo-
ﬂavin reductase were assayed spectrophotometrically. The lignin
peroxidase assay was performed by using n-propanol as substrate
(20 M/C01cm/C01) at 300 nm ( Shanmugam et al., 1999 ) and activity of
laccase was measured by oxidation of ABTS as substrate at 420 nm
(Hatvani and Mécs, 2001 ). Activity of veratryl alcohol oxidase was
determined by earlier reported method ( Jadhav et al., 2009 ). En-
zyme activity was calculated by using extinction coef ﬁcient of
oxidised veratryl alcohol (9.5 M/C01cm/C01) at 300 nm. Activity ofV.V. Chandanshive et al. / Environmental Research 150 (2016) 88 –96 89tyrosinase was measured by previously quoted method ( Zhang
and Flurkey, 1997 ). The total volume of 3.0 mL reaction mixture
contains 2.7 mL potassium phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 6.8),
0.1 mL catechol (1.5 mM), 0.1 mL L-ascorbic acid (2.5 mM), 0.1 mL
crude extract and absorbance was measured at 265 nm. The DCIP
reductase activity was performed using DCIP as substrate ( Salokhe
and Govindwar, 1999 ) and measured spectrophotometrically at
620 nm. Azo reductase and ribo ﬂavin reductase activity were
measured by previously reported method ( Kurade et al., 2011 ).
Activities of antioxidant enzymes catalase and superoxide dis-
mutase were determined as reported earlier by Vafaei et al. (2013) .
All enzyme assays were carried out at room temperature with
reference blank containing all components except crude extract.
The protein concentration was measured by Lowry method ( Lowry
et al., 1951 ). All enzyme sets were done in triplicate, average rate of
test calculated.
2.7. Analysis of metabolites
Decolorization of the Rubine GFL was examined by UV –visible
spectrophotometric analysis (Hitachi U-2800; Japan) using crude
extract, whereas metabolites were examined using High Perfor-
mance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), Fourier Transform Infrared
Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy
(GC-MS). For the extraction of the metabolites after the dye de-
colorization, plants were removed from dye solution and then
centrifuged to separate any solid particles like root hairs and dust
particle if present. The solution was extracted with equal volume
of ethyl acetate. The extract was evaporated and dried. Obtained
residue was redissolved in small quantity of HPLC grade methanol
and used for analytical study.
HPLC analysis was performed using Water 2690 equipped
system (Water Corporation, UK) on C18 column(4.6 mm /C2250 mm, 3.5 mm symmetry) and for mobile phase, HPLC
grade methanol was used with a ﬂow rate of 1 mL min
/C01at
280 nm. FTIR was used to determine changes in surface functional
group of control and phytotransformed dye product. The analysis
was carried out using Shimadzu 8400 S FTIR spectrometer (Shi-
madzu Corporation, Japan) in mid infra red region of 400 –
4000 cm/C01. The stereoscopically pure KBr mixed with extracted
residues in 95:5 ratios was used as sample ( Rane et al., 2014 ).
GC-MS analysis was used to identify the produced metabolites
after phytotransformation using a Shimadzu 2010 MS Engine
(Shimadzu Corporation, Japan) by earlier reported process. The
temperature was enhanced to 200 °C with a rate 10 °C min/C01and
then linearly raised to 280 °C at a rate of 20 °C min/C01. Helium was
used as sample carrier gas with a ﬂow rate of 1 mL min/C01. The
initial temperature of column was stabilised at 80 °C for 2 min by
oven. Produced metabolite was identi ﬁed using mass spectra and
structure was determined by NIST library.
2.8. Analysis of phytotoxicity and total bacterial count before and
after treatment
Toxicity of ef ﬂuents containing textile dyes has direct effects on
the photosynthetic reaction and also arrests the growth of the
plant. Fifty seeds of each T. aestivum (monocot )and P. mungo
(dicot) were taken separately in petri plate containing blotting
paper and phytotoxicity assay was done at 30 72°C. Daily appli-
cation of 5 mL untreated and treated Rubine GFL, dye mixture and
textile ef ﬂuent on separately above seeds to assess their phyto-
toxicity. Distilled water was kept as control at the same time. The
germination (%) of seed was compared to control. Plumule (shoot
length) and radicle (root length) were measured after 6 days.
One mL sample of textile ef ﬂuent was collected before and after
treatment. This sample was diluted using 0.9% saline (NaCl) and aserial dilution up to 7 times. This diluted sample was spread on a
nutrient agar medium and incubated at 37 °C. Bacterial count was
measured in terms of colony forming units (CFUs). The composi-
tion of nutrient agar medium was as follows (g/L) Yeast extract 1.5,
peptone 5, NaCl 5, beef extract 1.5% and 1.5% agar.
2.9. Phytotreatment in lagoons
Initial laboratory level studies showed potential of S. molesta
fern to degrade textile dyes; hence, it was further used for phy-
toremediation treatment process of textile ef ﬂuent at lagoon scale
on HRTS (High rate transmission system), Kagal, India. The initial
root length of the plant was 5 –8 cm at the time of collection. These
were stored in a lagoon for 15 days containing normal tap water.
During this period, plants were stabilised and root lengths grew up
to 10 –12 cm at the time of treatment. The dimension of lagoon was
7m/C25m/C22 m of surface area 35 m2. This lagoon was mulched
properly using mulching paper for reducing loss of ef ﬂuent. The
lagoon was provided an inlet as well as an outlet channel opposite
to each other for passing ef ﬂuent. At the time of treatment, lagoon
was ﬁlled with ef ﬂuent through inlet up to a height of 1.5 m
(52,500 L) and well grown plants of S. molesta were spread on the
lagoon. The sample was collected from inlet, noted as 0 h; while
after treatment sample was collected at 192 h. The lagoon was
stirred and with steel rod before collection of the samples so that
homogeneity was maintained and sampling errors minimized.
During ef ﬂuent treatment process parameters like ADMI, pH, COD,
BOD 5, TDS, TSS and heavy metals were analysed up to 8 days
(192 h) with 24 h intervals.
2.10. Statistical analysis
Data were analysed by one way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
with Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Decolorization of dye Rubine GFL by S. molesta
Wild plants of S. molesta was observed to decolorize various
screen dyes such as Remazol Black B, Red RBL, Bottle Green No.9,
Navy Blue Rx, Scarlet RR and Rubine GFL up to 48%, 61%, 58%, 64%,
69% and 76%, respectively within 60 h. Looking at maximum de-
colorization with Rubine GFL it was taken for further studies.
Absorbance of withdrawn supernatant was measured at 530 nm
which is the wavelength of its maximum absorbance. The percent
decolorization of the dye was observed to be 58%, 63%, 75%, 87%,
92% and 97%; with 166.5, 180.8, 215.3, 249.7, 264.0 and
278.4 mmole removal at 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 and 72 h, respectively.
Scarlet RR (50 mg/L) and Remazol Red (70 mg/L) were reported to
be decolorized previously by Ipomoea hederifolia and Alternanthera
philoxeroides within 72 h up to 96% and 100%, respectively ( Rane
et al., 2014 ,2015 ).Typha angustifolia was shown to decolorize
Reactive blue 19 up to 70% within 6 d ( Mahmood et al., 2014 ).
Bouteloua dactyloides was also shown to decolorized textile ef-
ﬂuent up to 92% within 24 h ( Vijayalakshmidevi and Muthukumar,
2014 ).
3.2. Involvement of S. molesta in treatment of dye mixture and textile
efﬂuent
S. molesta could also treat a simulated mixture of dyes and real
textile ef ﬂuent. ADMI removal values after treatment of the dye
mixture and ef ﬂuent were found to be decreased 5.4 and 6.5 fold,
respectively. COD, BOD 5, TDS, TSS, hardness and turbidity of dyeV.V. Chandanshive et al. / Environmental Research 150 (2016) 88 –96 90mixture after treatment by S. molesta were reduced by 3.2, 3.0, 4.5,
2.1, 2.5 and 1.9 fold, respectively. The textile ef ﬂuent also showed
reductions in the values of COD, BOD 5, TDS, TSS, hardness and
turbidity 2.9, 3.2, 5.5, 2.7, 2.8 and 5.1 fold, respectively. The TSS oftextile ef ﬂuent was decreased because it might be absorbed by
plant root. A signi ﬁcant decrease in the pH of textile ef ﬂuent as
well as dye mixture was observed after treatment using S. molesta
(Table 1 ).
In an earlier study, textile ef ﬂuent was treated using I. heder-
ifolia which revealed the reduced ADMI value, BOD and COD up to
88%, 63% and 68%, respectively within 60 h ( Rane et al., 2014 ).
Plants like Typhonium ﬂagelliforme, Blumea malcolmii and Phrag-
mites australis have been used for treatment of textile industry
efﬂuent and achieved noteworthy BOD, COD, TOC, TDS and TSS
removal ( Davies et al., 2005 ;Kagalkar et al., 2009 ,2010 ;Ong et al.,
2010 ).
3.3. Anatomical analysis of stem tissue of S. molesta during Rubine
GFL decolorization
Stem tissue of S. molesta grown in a beaker was harvested at
12 h intervals up to 60 h for histochemical analysis to understandthe movement of dye in tissue and location of degradation. Stem
tissue of control plant did not show the presence of dye color inany cell ( Fig. 1 a) and cells were observed to be in normal position.
Accumulation was seen to be spreads to neighbouring cortical cells
with the increase in the period of dye exposure. During ﬁrst 12 h
of dye exposure accumulation of the dye was observed in theepidermal cells ( Fig. 1 b). Further it spread to cortical cells at 24 h of
dye exposure ( Fig. 1 c). It is observed that as cortical region was
saturated with Rubine GFL and accumulated dye at epidermal cellsgradually decolorized ( Fig. 1 d). Dye degradation was observed in
both epidermal and cortical cells at 48 h ( Fig. 1 e). These results
indicate the biotransformation of dye in both the regions. Whenexposed plants were transferred to the normal tap water after 48 hexperiments, some epidermal cells were observed distorted andcontained small amount of residual dye after 60 h ( Fig. 1 f). Shapes
of xylem and phloem were also found distorted.
3.4. Alteration of photosynthetic pigment during decolorization
Chlorophylls and carotenoid concentrations in the leaves were
measured after 72 h of the dye exposure to S. molesta . During
decolorization process, chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotenoidwere found to be increased up to 11%, 19% and 29%, respectivelywhen compared to control ( Table 2 ).S. molesta is aﬂoating aquatic
fern which upon exposure to dyes might synthesize more chlor-ophyll (a, b) and carotenoid for ful ﬁlment of energy requirement.Table 1.

served in the leaves of I. hederifolia after scarlet RR exposure ( Rane
et al., 2014 ).
3.5. Analysis of enzyme activities of S. molesta during dye
degradation
Various oxido-reductive enzymes like LiP, VAO, SOD, laccase,
tyrosinase, catalase, DCIP and azo reductase in root and stem tis-
sues are well known to be involved in dye phytotransformation
processes. In present study, speci ﬁc activities of oxido-reductive
enzymes were observed in root tissues of S. molesta; like LiP, VAO,
laccase, tyrosinase, catalase, DCIP reductase and SOD activities
were observed to be induced by 8.1, 2.9, 1.3, 2.0, 2.9, 1.6 and
1.7 fold, respectively. Similarly, stem tissues of S. molesta showed
induction in the activities of enzymes such as LiP, VAO, laccase,
tyrosinase, catalase, DCIP reductase and SOD up to 5.1, 3.6, 4.9, 1.9,
2.5, 1.8 and 1.7 fold, respectively. Both root and stem tissues
showed a considerable decrease in activity of ribo ﬂavin reductase;
while speci ﬁc activity of azo reductase was observed to be induced
in root cell and decreased in stem tissues ( Table 3 ). Similar in-
duction in the activities of peroxidase enzyme was also noted in I.
palmate and P. australis during dye removal process ( Shafﬁqu et al.,
2002 ;Carias et al., 2007 ). Similar set of oxido-reductive enzymes
were have been shown to be induced during decolorization of
dyes Direct Red 5 B, Scarlet RR and Remazol Red using plant B.
malcolmii, I. hederifolia and Aster amellus, respectively ( Kagalkar
et al., 2009 ;Khandare et al., 2011 ;Rane et al., 2014 ).
3.6. Analysis of phyto-degradation products
The treated Rubine GFL, dye mixture and textile ef ﬂuent
showed different FTIR spectra from their respective controls. This
conﬁrmed the conversion of dye compound into different meta-
bolites ( Fig. S1 )(Table 6 ). The HPLC spectrum of untreated dye
Rubine GFL, dye mixture and textile industry ef ﬂuent were sig-
niﬁcantly differed from spectrum of their respective metabolites
produced after treatment. The obtained HPLC spectra of treatedand untreated sample of dye, dye mixture and textile ef ﬂuent
showed difference in retention time indicating degradation of dye
compound ( Fig. S2 )(Table 7 ).
The GC-MS analysis of treated dye Rubine GFL sample was used
to predict chemical structure and nature of the obtained products.
Two different peaks with m/z value of 278 and 149 were observed
after treatment. The obtained metabolites and increased level of
enzymes in root and stem tissue of S. molesta during decoloriza-
tion were used to predict degradation pathway of Rubine GFL.
Rubine GFL underwent the laccase or lignin peroxidase activity of
and cleaved the dye asymmetrically. Subsequent demethylationfurther resulted to form 2-{( E)-[4-(methylamino) phenyl] diaze-
nyl}-5-nitrobenzonitrile. This formed intermediate was then
cleaved by azo reductase to form two products such as 2-methyl-
4-nitroaniline and N-methylbenzene-1, 4-diamine ( Fig. S3 )(Ta-
ble 8 ). Asymmetrical and/or oxidative cleavage by the action of
enzymes such as veratryl alcohol oxidase and lignin peroxidase
and laccase has been shown to be the key mechanism behind the
dye structure breakdown ( Kabra et al., 2011 ;Khandare et al., 2011 ,
2013 ;Patil and Jadhav, 2013 ). Azo bond cleavage is known as the
function of azo reductase enzyme ( Leelakriangsak and Borisut,
2012 ).
3.7. Phytotoxicity monitoring
In many developing countries, textile ef ﬂuents have been ob-
served to be released into agricultural farms. Thus, it is important
to study the toxic effect of treated and untreated ef ﬂuent on
agricultural crop seedlings. Effect of untreated Rubine GFL, dye
mixture and textile ef ﬂuent showed reduced germinations of T.
aestivum and P. Mungo seeds. Decrease in the root and shoot
lengths were observed in all untreated samples. After 8 days oftreatment, seeds in untreated dye, dye mixture and ef ﬂuent
showed toxicity in the form of decreased the length of plumule
and radicle in comparison with the seeds grown in water. Dye
samples treated with S. molesta showed enhanced germination
percentages and shoot and root lengths indicating reduced toxicity
of formed metabolites ( Table 4 ). If retention time of treatment is
increased, proper dye removal could be achieved after which the
water be reused for agriculture.
3.8. Study of decolorization of dye containing textile ef ﬂuent in la-
goon using S. molesta
Plants of S. molesta with long and dense roots were prepared in
the lagoon containing tap water for 15 d before the treatment. S.
molesta plants were well grown in broad pH range of 3 –9 in ef-
ﬂuent, however wilting of whole plants was observed beyond pHTable 2.

plant after 15 d. Well grown plants were used for treatment oftextile ef ﬂuent in lagoon for 8 d. The values of ADMI, COD, BOD
5,
TDS and TSS were reduced by 81%, 76%, 82%, 67% and 63%, re-
spectively after the treatment. Additionally, Cadmium (Cd), chro-mium (Cr), lead (Pb) and arsenic (As) were decreased by 66%, 76%,50% and 71%, respectively after treatment. Bacterial count of un-
treated ef ﬂuent (28 /C210
/C07CFUs) was increased in treated ef ﬂuent
(93/C210/C07CFUs). Increase in bacterial population can be attrib-
uted towards the reduced toxicity and favourable conditions forgrowth. The pH of untreated ef ﬂuent was 9 which decreased aftertreatment to 7.2 ( Table 5 )(Table S1 ). The pH of dye mixture and
textile ef ﬂuent was shown to be decreased from 7.9 to 7.5 and 10.2
to 8.1, respectively after treatment by I. hederifolia (Rane et al.,
2014 ). In another study, treatment of dye ef ﬂuents of varying pH
were shown to be neutralized ( Rane et al., 2015 ).P. australis was
explored in vertical ﬂow constructed wetland for treatment of real
dye ef ﬂuent and a decrease in color and COD of 89% and 90%,
respectively was observed ( Ferreira et al., 2014 ). Horizontal bed
reactor constructed using Typha domingenesis was reported to
reduce BOD, COD, TSS and TDS of an ef ﬂuent up to 77%, 79%, 27%
and 59%, respectively after a treatment of 72 h ( Shehzadi et al.,
2014 ). In another study with a static reactor using Pogonatherum
crinitum also showed effective removal of ADMI, COD, BOD, TSS
and TDS up to 93% ,78% ,70% ,13% and 70%, respectively ( Watharkar
et al., 2015 ).Table 4.

An aquatic fern S. molesta (6072 g root biomass) could com-
pletely remove color and degrade the dye Rubine GFL within 72 h
because of its tolerance to dye conditions. S. molesta showed the
potential to decolorize and degrade textile ef ﬂuent at laboratory
scale as well as on ﬁeld application in a constructed lagoon of a
total surface area of 35 m2. The enzyme induction patterns suggest
involvement of oxido-reductive enzymes for dye degradation.Anatomical pattern of decolorization of dye Rubine GFL con ﬁrmed
the entry of dye into the tissue and further degradation. The de-veloped lagoon ef ﬁciently removes the dye as well as metals and
reduces the COD, BOD
5, TSS, TDS and pH of real textile industrial
efﬂuent. After treatment of dye Rubine GFL, dye mixture and
textile ef ﬂuent showed unaffected shoot and root development
after germination of T. aestivum and P. mungo seeds. Further re-
search on treating textile ef ﬂuents on actual dye disposal site is in
progress.
