Study objective: We investigate the clinical effects of escitalopram overdose and determine the risk of QT
prolongation and serotonin toxicity.
Methods: A review of escitalopram overdoses to a clinical toxicology unit was undertaken. Patient
demographics, details of the ingestion, clinical effects, including evidence of serotonin toxicity, complications
(arrhythmias and seizures), ICU admission, and length of stay were obtained. QT and QRS intervals were
manually measured on ECGs by using a standardized approach. In a subgroup of 34 prospectively recruited
patients, escitalopram was detected in blood from 33 patients. Medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) were
reported, and QT versus pulse rate was plotted on a QT nomogram to investigate QT prolongation.
Results: Median ingested dose in the 79 presentations was 140 mg (IQR 75 to 260 mg; range 20 to 560 mg),
and escitalopram was the only drug ingested or all coingested drugs were nontoxic in 46 cases. Median length
of stay for patients receiving clinically important coingestants was 19 hours (IQR 9 to 33 hours) compared with
that of patients receiving escitalopram alone (median 12 hours; IQR 7 to 19 hours). Serotonin toxicity occurred
in 7 of the 46 escitalopram-alone ingestions (15%) but in only 1 of the 33 patients coingesting other
medications. Common features were inducible clonus and hyperreﬂexia. Central nervous system depression and
ICU admission were rare in escitalopram-alone overdoses compared with those in cases with sedative
coingestants. Bradycardia (pulse rate /H1102160 beats/min) occurred in 11 cases (14%) and an abnormal QT–HR pair
in 11 (14%), which was associated with normal or slow pulse rates. There were no deaths, seizures, or
arrhythmias.
Conclusion: Major manifestations of escitalopram overdose were serotonin toxicity, QT prolongation, and
bradycardia. The study suggests a potential for cardiac arrhythmias in escitalopram overdose. [Ann Emerg Med.

INTRODUCTION
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been
used for more than a decade for the treatment of depression and
anxiety disorders. One advantage of this group of
antidepressants is they appear to be relatively safe in overdose
compared with the older tricyclic antidepressants.1The majority
of SSRI overdoses cause minor effects characterized by mild to
moderate serotonin toxicity and occasionally seizures in large
overdoses. However, QT-interval prolongation and arrhythmias
have been reported, mainly with citalopram2and more recently
in case reports of escitalopram toxicity.3,4
Escitalopram is the S-enantiomer of citalopram and has been
marketed because it is a more potent inhibitor of the serotonin
transporter and likely accounts for the majority of the inhibitory
effect in racemic citalopram.5,6A review of nonclinical and
clinical studies of escitalopram versus citalopram shows that ona dose-equivalent basis, escitalopram has greater efﬁcacy and
onset of action compared with citalopram. This appears to be
due to an inhibitory effect of the R-isomer on escitalopram,
possibly because of an allosteric interaction at the serotonin
transporter.7It is therefore likely that citalopram and
escitalopram will cause differing effects in overdose.
During the last 5 years, there has been an increase in the
prescription of escitalopram and an associated increase in
overdoses. There are few published reports of the effects of
escitalopram overdose,3,4,8-11and it is unclear whether
escitalopram and citalopram are similar in overdose.
Serotonin toxicity may be more common with escitalopram
than with citalopram or other SSRIs because of its increased
serotonergic potency. A single case of prolonged and severe
serotonin toxicity has been previously reported with
escitalopram overdose,9but there is no information on the
404 Annals ofEmergency Medicine Volume , .  : September frequency and severity of serotonin toxicity in escitalopram
overdose.
There is limited information on the risk of QT prolongation
and cardiac arrhythmias with escitalopram. We have previously
shown that QT prolongation and torsades de pointes are
associated with citalopram overdose,12,13but it is unclear
whether escitalopram has a similar association with QT
prolongation. Three cases of QT prolongation with
escitalopram overdose have been reported,3,4,8and in a
retrospective review of escitalopram overdoses from a regional
poison center, ECG changes were found, but the speciﬁc ECG
abnormalities were not reported.11No animal studies on the
effect of the citalopram enantiomers on the QT interval have
been reported, making it difﬁcult to determine whether the QT
abnormalities seen with citalopram are due to the S-enantiomer,
R-enantiomer or both. It is therefore important to conﬁrm that
escitalopram poisoning causes QT prolongation in a larger series
of cases and estimate the frequency of abnormal QT intervals.
The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of
escitalopram in overdose and determine the risk of QT
prolongation, serotonin toxicity, and any other major clinical
complications.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Setting
The study was a review of consecutive presentations of
escitalopram overdose to a regional inpatient toxicology unitwith a referral population of about 300,000 people. The unit is
not a poison center, and all patients are examined and treated by
an attending clinical toxicologist in the emergency department
(ED) or the inpatient unit. For all toxicology presentations,
predeﬁned clinical and laboratory information is recorded in a
relational database. The use of this database for research
purposes has previously been exempted by the Human Research
Ethics Committee as an audit, and separate ethics approval was
obtained for prospective collection of clinical data, blood
samples, and ECG results from a subgroup of patients.
Selection of Participants
All patients with a diagnosis of escitalopram overdose
between October 2003 and September 2008 were identiﬁed in
the database, and information on clinical effects was extracted.
If available, ECGs were obtained from the medical record for
each presentation. The history of drug ingestion is always
conﬁrmed prospectively on at least 2 occasions for all patients
(history from ambulance ofﬁcers, family, and friends; empty
medication containers). For a subgroup of patients who were
prospectively recruited to a pharmacokinetic study of drugs in
overdose, multiple blood samples were collected and
escitalopram was quantiﬁed by high-performance liquid
chromatography.
Data Collection and Processing
The following data were extracted from the database: patient
demographic characteristics (age, sex), details of the ingestion
(estimated time of ingestion, dose ingested, coingested drugs),
clinical effects (maximum and minimum pulse rate, systolic
blood pressure and Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score during
their hospital stay), evidence of serotonin toxicity (Hunter
Serotonin Toxicity Criteria,14clonus, myoclonus, hyperreﬂexia,
rigidity, temperature), complications (arrhythmias and seizures),
and admission details (ICU admission, length of stay).
Coingested drugs were classiﬁed as nontoxic (including alcohol
alone), sedative, known effect on the QT interval,
anticonvulsant, antidepressant, and major toxicity (ie,
acetaminophen hepatotoxicity, cytotoxicity).
All 12-lead ECGs were read by using a standardized
approach. QT intervals were measured from the beginning of
the Q wave up to the point at which the T wave returned to
baseline. QT intervals were measured in 6 leads (3 chest and 3
limb leads), and the median interval was calculated. Pulse rate
was taken from the automated ECG readout and assumed to be
an average measure of the RR for the ECG. QRS intervals were
measured manually in all ECGs.
All patients with toxicology presentations at the hospital are
treated entirely in the ED (60%), admitted to the toxicology
inpatient ward (30%), or admitted to the ICU (10%).
Toxicology patients are admitted to the ICU if they have a
decreased level of consciousness (GCS score /H110219), require
intubation and ventilation, require hemodynamic monitoring or
circulatory support, or have other major organ dysfunction
requiring dedicated nursing observation. While in the ED, allEditor’s Capsule Summary
What is already known on this topic
Escitalopram, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI),
is the S-enantiomer of citalopram. Little is known
about its toxicity.
What question this study addressed
The toxicity proﬁle of escitalopram was studied in
79 consecutive patients admitted to a clinical
toxicology unit in Australia.
What this study adds to our knowledge
Major manifestations of overdose were serotonin
toxicity, QT prolongation, and bradycardia. The
risk of cardiac arrhythmias according to QT
intervals appear similar to that with citalopram.
Coingestion of a sedative drug was associated with
an increased rate of admission to the ICU and
longer length of stay.
How this might change clinical practice
Patients with escitalopram overdose should receive
care appropriate for SSRI overdoses, but they
should also have monitoring of the QT interval.van Gorp, Whyte & Isbister Effects of Escitalopram Overdose
Volume , .  : September  Annals ofEmergency Medicine 405toxicology patients have continuous telemetry. If they have
prolonged QT on their ECG they are admitted to a telemetry
bed for ongoing monitoring.
Primary Data Analysis
For descriptive statistics, medians and interquartile ranges
(IQR) are reported. QT–HR pairs were plotted on a previously
developed QT nomogram15and examined by visual inspection,
including with and without coingested drugs that affect the QT
interval.
RESULTS
There were 80 presentations for patients with escitalopram
overdose during the study period. In one patient reporting a
large overdose (750 mg), the blood concentrations were
inappropriately low, and this case was excluded. The remaining
79 presentations involved 68 patients. One patient presented 4
times, one patient presented 3 times, and 6 patients presented
twice. ECGs were available for 78 of these presentations. There
were 46 presentations in which escitalopram was the only drug
taken in overdose or all coingestants were classiﬁed as nontoxic;
these cases comprise the escitalopram-alone overdose group.
Blood samples were available for a subgroup of 34 patients, and
escitalopram was quantiﬁed (median concentration 107.5 /H9262g/L;
range 12 to 520 /H9262g/L).
The median age of the 79 patients was 30 years (IQR 22 to
40 years; range 15 to 59 years) and 63 were female patients
(80%). Escitalopram-alone overdose presentations are compared
with those with ingestion of escitalopram and other drugs
(Table 1). The median ingested dose for all cases was 140 mg
(IQR 75 to 260 mg; range 20 to 560 mg) and did not differ
between escitalopram-alone overdoses and those with
coingestants. The median length of stay for patients receivingclinically important coingestants was 19 hours (IQR 9 to 33
hours) and longer than for patients receiving escitalopram-alone
overdoses (median 12 hours; IQR 7 to 19 hours). On 7
occasions, patients were admitted to the ICU, but in 5 of those
instances, clinically important coingestants were received. There
were no deaths, seizures, or arrhythmias documented in any
patient.
Serotonin toxicity occurred in 7 escitalopram-alone overdose
patients (15%; Table 2) and in 1 patient ingesting escitalopram
and coingestants (3%). All serotonergic features were more
common in escitalopram-alone overdoses. The commonest
serotonergic features were hyperreﬂexia in 21 (46%) and
inducible clonus in 12 cases (26%). Severe serotonin toxicityTable 1. Clinical features, outcomes, and treatment of all cases of escitalopram overdose comparing escitalopram alone with

38.5°C (101.3°F) or rigidity resulting in respiratory
compromise did not occur. Low GCS score and ICU admission
were rare in escitalopram-only overdoses compared with those
of patients ingesting coingestants, particularly sedative
coingestants. In both patients with a GCS score less than 9, a
sedative coingestant was taken (promethazine [250 mg] in one
and olanzapine [600 mg] in the other).
Bradycardia (pulse rate /H1102160 beats/min) occurred in 11
escitalopram patients (14%) and tachycardia (pulse rate /H11022100
beats/min) in 33 (42%), which was not different between cases
with coingestants or escitalopram alone (Table 1). In the 5
presentations with bradycardia in a patient coingesting other
drugs, none of the coingested drugs are known to cause
bradycardia. Hypotension (systolic blood pressure /H1102190 mm
Hg) occurred in 8 cases (10%), and only 2 of these were
escitalopram-alone overdoses (Table 1). QT–HR pairs were
plotted on the QT nomogram (Figure), and 11 were considered
“at risk” (Table 3). One patient had an abnormal QT result on
2 different hospital presentations, and the remaining 9 were
different patients. The median maximum QRS width was 80
ms (IQR 80 to 85 ms; range 70 to 120 ms), and in only 1 case
was the QRS 120 ms.
LIMITATIONS
The study was a nonrandomized retrospective analysis of
data collected prospectively in a clinical database. Because data
are recorded independent of any study hypothesis, detailedinformation that is relevant to this study may not be recorded.
Similarly, in some cases only a single or limited number of
ECGs were recorded. However, at least 1 ECG was available in
all but 1 case, and in 33 cases in which blood was collected,
serial ECGs were prospectively obtained for the entire
presentation/admission.
In estimating ingested dose, we relied on patient reports, as
well as history from ambulance ofﬁcers, friends and family, and
presence of empty drug containers. This could create a source of
inaccuracy because patients may be unable to recall the exact
dose ingested. However, previous pharmacokinetic studies16,17
indicate that patient reports of ingested dose are a reasonable
estimate of the true ingested dose. Furthermore, there was only
1 patient who claimed to have taken an overdose but had very
low blood concentrations. This may have also occurred in the
patients who did not have analytic conﬁrmation of
escitalopram. However, according to the fact that 33 of 34
patients who stated they ingested an escitalopram overdose had
plasma concentration consistent with an overdose, it is unlikely
that this occurred in more than another 1 or 2 patients. An
increasing number of studies now support the fact that patient
history of an overdose is reliable.16-19
DISCUSSION
This study describes the clinical effects of escitalopram in
overdose, including ECG changes. Serotonin toxicity occurred
in 16% of escitalopram-alone overdoses, a similar frequency to
other SSRIs and in particular citalopram.2There were no cases
of life-threatening serotonin toxicity, and serotonin toxicity was
less common if coingestants were taken. Other neurologic
effects were rare, including central nervous system depression,
which occurred exclusively in patients taking sedative
coingestants (Table 1). Seizures were not reported and are likely
to be rare. The frequency and type of ECG effects were similar
to that of citalopram, with 14% of patients having potential risk
for torsades de pointes, as indicated by an abnormal QT–HR
pair. Bradycardia occurred in 11% of escitalopram overdoses, a
frequency similar to that in other SSRI overdoses.2

overdose.15In this study only 4 of 318 (1%) of the control

Volume , .  : September  Annals ofEmergency Medicine 407The risk of QT prolongation in patients with citalopram
overdose has previously been investigated. In a group of 254
patients with a citalopram overdose, 25 (10%) were considered
to have a QT interval at risk.20As in our study, patients were
considered at risk if their QT–HR pair was out of normal
ranges, as deﬁned in the QT nomogram.15The number of
patients deemed at risk in our study is similar. Another
similarity to citalopram overdose is that cases with at-risk QT
intervals more often developed bradycardia or had a normal
pulse rate, rather than developing tachycardia (Figure),20which
was a similar pattern to that seen in a separate study in which
cases with drug-induced torsades de pointes were plotted on the
QT nomogram.15This contrasts with drugs such as venlafaxine
and quetiapine, in which patients at risk often had tachycardia
(pulse rate /H11022105 beats/min).21The frequency of at-risk QT–
HR pairs in escitalopram overdose with most associated with
bradycardia suggests that escitalopram-overdose patients are at
risk of torsades de pointes, similar to those taking citalopram
overdoses.
Escitalopram causes effects similar to those of other SSRIs in
overdose, with the major manifestation being serotonin
toxicity.2According to this small series, there appears to be an
additional risk of torsades de pointes in escitalopram overdose
(according to the greater-than-expected number of abnormal
QT–HR pairs), which is similar to that with citalopram
overdose.
