abstract
Lignocellulosic agricultural by-products have been used as non-conventional and inexpensive 
adsorbents for treating different pollutants. In this work, the uptake capacity of corncob (CC) 
was evaluated in the removal of Direct blue 2 (DB2) dye, a diazo dye widely used in the textile 
industry. A 23 full factorial design led to 88.3% DB2 removal under a CC dosage of 6.0 g L–1, an 
initial DB2 concentration of 60 ppm, and a particle size range of 0.3–0.5 mm. A subsequent opti-
mization of the process through a central composite surface design allowed to achieve an effi-
ciency of 89.81% by increasing the dosage to 8.0 g L–1 and keeping the initial DB2 concentration 
and particle size range of the previous design. Under these optimized conditions a maximum adsorption capacity of 158.085, 132.043 and 101.841 mg g
–1 at 298, 308, and 318 K was respectively 
obtained. The evaluation of the kinetics showed the best adjustment with the Elovich equation at 
298 and 308 K with a correlation coefficient R2 = 0.95 and 0.97 correspondingly, whereas at 318 K 
the second-order model exhibited the best fit with a R2 = 0.97. Regarding process equilibrium, the 
Langmuir-Freundlich equation was found to present the best fit over the four evaluated models 
with an average adjustment coefficient R2 = 0.99. Further, the assessment of the RL value in a con-
centration range of 5–4,000 ppm for all temperatures led to values between 0 and 1.0 which sup-
port the favorability of this adsorption process. Finally, the thermodynamic parameters with neg-
ative values for Gibbs free energy (ΔG  = –1,435.41 J mol–1) and enthalpy (ΔH  = –14,813.54 J mol–1) 
pointed out the spontaneity and exothermic feature of the process, while entropy described a slight randomness at the interface of the solution (ΔS  = –44.87 J mol
–1 K–1). Thus, the obtained results 
suggest CC as a novel and promising adsorbent for a feasible scaling up of this process.

1. Introduction
The presence of synthetic dyes in rivers and lakes rep-
resents a serious and recurring environmental issue in 
Colombia, which is mainly attributed to the textile and food industries that currently discharge their liquid effluents without any prior treatment. In the case of the textile indus-try with its multiple unit operations and due to the use of different raw materials, reagents and production methods, the discharges contain residues of salts, starch, peroxides, surfactants, metals, emulsifiers and dyes, among others.
Particularly, the aromatic structure of the dyes explains 
their high resistance to light, heat, and weather condi-tions with the subsequent slow and difficult degradation that turns the dye-bearing effluents into real sources of pollution. Their presence, even at concentrations less than 1 ppm [1], affects gas solubility, water transparency, and L.M. Gómez, A. Hormaza / Desalination and Water Treatment 224 (2021) 421–432 422
the habitat aesthetics. Likewise, these molecules increase 
both the biochemical oxygen demand and the chemical oxygen demand, and lead to a decrease in the entry of sunlight, interrupting the photosynthetic process. This fact promotes anoxic conditions which are highly harm-ful to the aquatic biota [1–5]. Furthermore, the recalcitrant nature of dyes can cause cytotoxic and genotoxic effects, triggering allergic reactions and genome damage [6–8].
There are different methods to treat dissolved dyes 
and organic matter contained in water, such as treatment with manganese nanoparticles that have photo-catalytic effects on their degradation [9] or recent technologies such as combined electrocoagulation with bio adsorption where removals of up to 90.01% were obtained [10]. On the other hand, the concern about the environment and natural resources has given rise to a critical view on the suitability of the methods to be used for dissolved pollutant treatment, such as synthetic dyes. In this sense, adsorption may be promising for removing this type of pollutants and other organic matter dissolved in wastewaters. Several materials, including clay materials, such as halloysite [11], cobalt-doped iron [12], or biocomposite with sugarcane bagasse [13] can be used for this process, but natural agricultural by-products has been classified as one of the best alterna-tives because of its high efficiency, low cost, possible re-use of the adsorbent material, and pollutant retention without molecular breakdown [14,15], avoiding in this way the generation of more toxic compounds, as usually occurs in processes such as photodegradation [16,17].
Regarding the evaluation of agricultural by-prod-
ucts as potential adsorbents, a wide variety is reported, including rice husk, corncob, sugarcane bagasse and cof-fee husk, among others [18,19]. In our research group, it has been found that corncob is one of the most prominent non-conventional adsorbents, allowing a 99% removal under optimized conditions for both red 40 and tartrazine dyes [20,21]. Moreover, another decisive factor in the group for agricultural by-product selection lies in its wide avail-ability in our environment. In this regard, the Ministry of Agriculture and rural development of Colombia, has reported approximately 1.5 million tons of corn produced in 2018 [22]; a percentage close to 50% corresponds to the grain [23] and the other 50% to the waste such as corncob, leaves and cane, among others. From these residues, it is estimated that corncob represents 18% [24], thus disposing of 135 mil-
lion tons for the mentioned year. It is worth mentioning that corn is widely spread in regions of the country, given its unique adaptation to diverse agroclimatic and socioeco-nomic conditions, cultivating two types of corn, yellow and white [25]. In addition, it is valuable to remark that this crop is widespread throughout the world so that the methodol-ogy presented here can be replicated anywhere [26].
Concerning synthetic colorants, the Direct blue 2 
(DB2) dye is part of the azo compounds, classified as the most prominent chemical group of currently existing dyes (approximately 26,000) [20]. Several studies have shown through animal tests that the azo group is a cause of cancer; therefore, its carcinogenic effect in humans is expected [27]. This dye is widely used in the textile indus-try and is featured by its large structure consisting of six benzene rings and two azo groups (Fig. 1). An average percentage close to 15% of non-fixation in the staining process has been reported for these azo dyes in the textile 
industry [28], indicating that they will be present in indus-
trial wastewaters, disrupting the balance of the surrounding 
environment.
According to our review on this topic, there are few 
reported works for DB2 treatment. For instance, Hashem 
[29] showed the removal of DB2 with modified wood pulp, 
adsorbent that is obtained not from a residue but from a 
material with other possible applications and for whose preparation, the addition of different organic bases such as dimethylamine and epichloridrine is required through a prolonged stirring and heating reaction that definitely makes the process unfeasible. The use of coal obtained from banana peel is proposed by Peluffo and Castro [30] for the retention of DB2, reporting efficiencies between 70 and 80%, results that, although satisfactory, are derivate from the application of a univariate study model. Besides, this alternative implies additional energy costs to carbonize this agricultural by-product. Also, coffee waste is reported for the adsorption of DB2 under continuous process [31] and it should be mentioned that this study considered very small ranges for the selected variables that do not guarantee opti-mal results for a possible scale-up of the process.
The previous overview points out that corncob (CC) has 
not yet been evaluated as a potential and unconventional adsorbent in the removal of the azo dye DB2. Therefore, in the present work two objectives were set, firstly, to evalu-ate the removal capacity of CC in the retention of the DB2 dye until process optimization and secondly, to carry out the study of kinetics, equilibrium and thermodynamics of this process with the overall purpose to establish the pos-sible use of this agricultural waste for a subsequent scaling up of this process. For the study of kinetics, the Elovich, pseudo-first and pseudo-second-order equations were con-sidered, while for the equilibrium evaluation the Langmuir, Freundlich, Langmuir-Freundlich and Redlich-Peterson models were selected. The spontaneity of the process was defined with the thermodynamic parameters of free energy, enthalpy and entropy. In addition, it should be noted that to guarantee the reliability of the results, a factorial design with replications of three units were carried out in each assay.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Preparation of DB2 solution
The commercial Direct blue 2, whose color index cor -
responds to CI 22590 was purchased with 98% purity from 
the company Colorquimica S.A. (Medellín, Colombia). This direct dye with a double azo group has a molecular formula C
32H21N6Na3O11S3, a molar mass of 830.71 g mol–1 
and is widely used in the textile industry (Fig. 1). The other  
Fig. 1. Direct blue 2 chemical structure [24].423 L.M. Gómez, A. Hormaza / Desalination and Water Treatment 224 (2021) 121–432
chemical reagents, sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric 
acid 37%, were purchased at Sigma-Aldrich (Mexico).
A standard solution of 120 mg L–1 DB2 dye was pre-
pared in deionized water, from which dilutions to make the respective calibration curve were performed, and the 
absorbance was measured at the maximum wavelength of this dye, λ
max = 562 nm.
2.2. Agricultural by-product pretreatment
The agricultural by-product corncob (CC) was obtained 
from a local market in Medellín (Colombia) and was sub-jected to a milling and sieving process to obtain a parti-
cle size between 300–1,000 μm. These particles were then 
washed five times with deionized water to eliminate a slightly yellow color, dried at 60°C for 48 h in a forced con-
vection oven, and finally stored in airtight containers for 
subsequent adsorption tests.
2.3. DB2 adsorption through factorial and response 
surface designs with a central point
The adsorption process was performed under a dis-
continuous system using for each test 25 mL of the dye 
solution in 25 mL Erlenmeyer flasks. Once the respective contact time was over, the dyed material was separated from the residual solution by filtration. To calculate the removal capacity, the absorbances of the starting and remaining solutions were measured with a Perkin Elmer UV-Vis Lambda 35 spectrophotometer (Mexico) at the maximum absorption wavelength of this dye. The response variable, percentage of DB2 removal (% Rem.), was calculated using Eq. (1) presented in Hashem [29].
First, a 2
3 full factorial design with a central point was 
carried out to evaluate the following factors, adsorbent dosage (D ), initial dye concentration (Co) and particle 
size (Ps), whose levels are detailed in Table 1. All mea-surements were performed in triplicate for statistical sup-port; each test had three replicates for a total of 27 sam-ples. The fixed conditions for this experiment included a pH = 2.0, which was adjusted with the addition of 1.0 N solutions of NaOH and HCl, stirring speed of 180 rpm, contact time of 2 days at room temperature, these val-
ues correspond to the most appropriate conditions from previous tests. After the required time, an aliquot was taken, centrifuged at 180 rpm, and the concentration of the dye was measured in the supernatant. Subsequently, to achieve optimal conditions for DB2 removal onto corncob, a response surface design with a central point was car -
ried out, bearing in mind the most influential factors of the previous factorial design, which were D  and Co. The 
ranges taken for this experiment are detailed in Table 1. Similarly, each test was carried out in triplicate for a total of 27 samples. Statistical tests were assessed with 95% confidence. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for comparing results. Besides, to ensure independence, sam-ples were selected, and treatments were applied at random.
2.4. Evaluation of DB2 adsorption kinetics
The adsorption kinetics allows to determine how 
quickly the dye interacts with the adsorbent surface, being 
one of the most important characteristics that define the 
efficiency of an adsorbent. In this work, three kinetic equa-
tions corresponding to the kinetics of pseudo-first- order, 
pseudo-second-order and Elovich were implemented 
by the study of Azizian [32].
2.5. Pseudo-first-order
It is one of the most widely used kinetic models that 
can be mathematically expressed as Eq. (1) [33,34].

qqKte
et−


where qe and qt are the amount of adsorbate transferred 
to the surface of the adsorbent at equilibrium and time 
t, respectively, K1 is the speed constant in min–1 and can 
be calculated from the slope by plotting ln( qe/qe – qt) vs. t.
2.6. Pseudo-second-order equation
This model is based on the adsorption capacity in 
equilibrium and assumes that the adsorption speed is 
directly proportional to the square of available sites; it is 
mathematically expressed as Eq. (2) [35,36].

of the adsorbent in a certain time (mg g–1), t is the time

adsorbent at equilibrium (mg g–1), and K2 is the speed 
constant (g mg–1 min–1). By plotting t /qt vs. t , the value of 
the constant from the intercept can be calculated.
2.7. Elovich equation
This model assumes that the active sites of the adsor -
bent are heterogeneous and therefore exhibit different 
activation energies that are represented as follows in Eq. (3) [36].
qtt=()+ ()lnlnβα
ββ1 (3)
where α is the initial adsorption rate (mg g–1 min–1) and β 
is the activation energy by chemo-absorption (mg g–1). 
By plotting qt vs. ln(t), α and β can be calculated from 
the slope and intercept.
2.8. Evaluation of the kinetics of the process
To evaluate the DB2 kinetics, the solution was prepared 
according to the best conditions obtained from the optimi-
zation with the surface design, a dosage of 8.0 g L–1 and an 
initial dye concentration of 60 ppm. In 100 mL Erlenmeyer 
flasks, 20 mL of the solution was taken for each assay. These Erlenmeyer were sealed and placed in a shaker with an incubator to keep the temperature constant through-out the process at a stirring speed of 180 rpm. These solu-tions were monitored for 12 h with sampling times of 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 420, and 720 min.
These samples were measured at the maximum absorp-
tion wavelength to determine the residual dye concen-tration. All analyzes were performed in triplicate way at temperatures of 298, 308, 318, and 328 K. Subsequently, Eqs. (1)–(3) were used to determine the model that best fits the experimental results.
2.9. Evaluation of DB2 equilibrium
Adsorption isotherms are essential for describing the 
interaction between the dye and the adsorbent and very use-
ful to determine the adsorbent capacity of different materials. 
In particular, Langmuir, Freundlich, Langmuir-Freundlich, and Redlich-Peterson mathematical models were imple-mented in this work [37,38]. All analyzes were performed 
in triplicate way at temperatures of 298, 308, 318, and 328 K.
2.10. Langmuir model
The Langmuir isotherm is a theoretical model suitable 
for adsorption in a monolayer on a completely homoge-
neous surface with a finite number of identical and spe-cific adsorption sites so that only one molecule is retained or linked to each other; therefore, an interaction between the molecules is negligible. The corresponding equation is mathematically expressed as follows [38].
qQKC
KCeLe
Le=+max1 (4)where Qmax is the maximum capacity of the adsorbate 
under given conditions, in this case DB2 (mg g–1), KL is the 
Langmuir constant indicating the affinity of the adsor -
bate for the adsorbent, qe is the amount of adsorbate 
transferred to the surface of the adsorbent, and Ce is the 
concentration of the adsorbate in equilibrium.
2.11. Freundlich model
Freundlich equation in contrast to Langmuir model con-
siders that the surface of the adsorbent is heterogeneous, 
and adsorption positions have different affinities, occupy-
ing first those of greater affinity and then the others [39,40]. 
This model is described as follows by Eq. (5).
qK CeF en=1/ (5)
where KF is the Freundlich constant associated with the 
adsorption capacity of the dye, n is the Freundlich constant indicating the intensity of the adsorption, q
e is the amount 
of adsorbate transferred to the surface of the adsorbent, and 
Ce is the concentration of the adsorbate in the equilibrium.
2.12. Langmuir-Freundlich model
This model is used to describe liquid–solid equilibrium 
systems incorrectly described by the Langmuir model. The mathematical expression of the Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm is as follows [41].
qAC
BCeem
em=
+1 (6)
where A and B are the Langmuir-Freundlich constant in L  g–1 
and L  mg–1, respectively, and m is the index of heterogeneity.
2.13. Redlich-Peterson model
This isotherm has a great similarity with the Langmuir-
Freundlich model in the sense that it is applied to describe 
the liquid–solid equilibria when the system is not adequately 
represented by the Langmuir model. The mathematical 
expression corresponds to Eq. (7) [42]:
qAC
BCee

Standard enthalpy change (H°), and standard entropy 
changes (S°) will allow to define the spontaneous or non-spontaneous nature of the selected adsorption process.
2.14. Thermodynamic parameters
Thermodynamic parameters reflect the feasibility of 
a process. Thus, the evaluation of standard free energy 
changes (G), standard enthalpy change (H), and standard entropy changes (S) will allow to define the spontaneous or non-spontaneous nature of the selected adsorption process.
To assess these thermodynamic parameters, the method 
referred by the study of Niwas et al. [43] was used, which 425 L.M. Gómez, A. Hormaza / Desalination and Water Treatment 224 (2021) 121–432
is based on the variation of the thermodynamic equilib-
rium constant K (or the thermodynamic coefficient) with 
the change in temperature. The value of K is calculated 
through the following steps.
First, K° for the adsorption reaction is described as 
follows:
Ka

ee= =  (8)
where as is the activity of the adsorbed solute, ae is the activ-
ity of the solute in solution at equilibrium, Cs is the surface 
concentration of DB2 in millimoles per gram of exchanger, 
Ce is the concentration of DB2 at equilibrium (mmol mL–1), 
vs is the activity coefficient of the adsorbed solute, 
and ve is the activity coefficient of the solute in solution.
When the concentration of the solute in the solution 
comes to near zero, the activity coefficient approaches unity, reducing (8) and (9).

Values of K° are obtained by plotting ln(Cs/Ce) vs. Cs 
and extrapolating Cs to zero [44]. The straight line obtained 
is fitted to the points based on a least-squares analy-sis. Its intercept with the vertical axis gives the values of K°. Standard free energy changes (G) for interactions 
are calculated [45] from Eq. (10).
GR TK =− ()ln  (10)
where R is the universal gas constant, and T is the tempera-
ture in Kelvin.
The enthalpy and entropy are calculated from 
Eq. (11) by plotting G vs. T, as the intercept and the slope, 
respectively.

3. Results
3.1. Statistical design of experiment
3.1.1. 23 full factorial design
Table 2 shows the average removal percentages for each 
of the 9 experiments, where the first treatment led to the 
most suitable conditions achieving an efficiency of 88.30% 
under the highest dosage level (6.0 g L–1) and the lowest 
level of Co (60 ppm) and Ps (0.3–0.5 mm).
In order to explain this adsorption behavior of the 
DB2-CC system, the effect of  D, Co, and Ps were analyzed 
by the Pareto chart, where the factors and their interactions 
are shown from highest to lowest significance (Fig. 2a).
Factors that exceed the vertical line have a statistically 
significant effect with a confidence level of 95% given by the p-value of the ANOVA analysis (Table 3). The individ-
ual interactions are the most significant, and factor D dis-plays a high positive effect on the DB2 removal, which can be explained by the increase of active sites in interaction with dye molecules. On the other hand, an increase in Ps and Co reduce the efficiency of the process, since the sur -
face area is decreased and the number of molecules to be adsorbed is increased, respectively. The foregoing indicates that to improve the removal of DB2 onto CC, Co and Ps must decrease while D must increase. The predictive model for the 2
3 full factorial design is shown in Eq. (12) that yields a 
maximum removal of 88.95%, with a D of 6.0 g L–1, a Co of 
60 mg L–1, and a Ps of 0.3–0.5 mm.

3.1.2. Central composite response surface design
For this analysis, Ps was fixed with the level that led 
to the best removal of DB2 (0.3–0.5 mm) in the factorial 
design. For factor D, the range was extended from 2.0 to 
8.0 g L–1, as suggested by the previous design. Even though 
the Pareto chart recommends a decrease in Co, it was 
decided to set the same range used in the factorial design, since one of the aims of this work is to treat dye-bearing effluents with concentrations greater than 60 ppm in the perspective of removing as much DB2 as possible.
Table 2 shows the removal percentages of the surface 
design, obtaining in all cases better removals under the set conditions. Again, the conditions of the first experiment led to a maximum removal of 89.81%. With respect to the Pareto chart, a similar behavior to that registered in the factorial design for the individual factors was observed, Fig. 2b; however, the interactions are significant except for the Co-Co interaction (p-values are given in Table 3).
D-Co interaction was positive and D-D was negative, 
which gives account of the curvatures on the response surface, where the latter being significant reflects a max-imum on it, which can be seen in Fig. 2c, pointing out that the selected levels for the design were suitable for the experiment. The surface mapping plot is depicted in Fig. 2d whose mathematical model is given by Eq. (13).

The predictive model, with an adjusted correlation coef-
ficient R2 = 97.89%, yields a maximum removal of 91.47% 
at Co of 60 ppm and D  of 8.0 g L–1, respectively. Although 
the increase in efficiency was relatively low, 1.51% experi-
mentally and 2.52% predictively, to those determined in 
the 23 factorial design, these optimal conditions of 60 ppm 
and 8.0 g L–1 were used as the best for the following 
kinetic and equilibrium experiments, since of the CC is a very low-priced by-product.
3.2. Adsorption kinetics
The experimental data of the adsorption kinetics for 
the DB2-CC system at temperatures of 298, 308, and 318 K 
are presented in Figs. 3a–c, respectively at a dosage of 
8.0 g L
–1 and an initial concentration of 60 ppm.L.M. Gómez, A. Hormaza / Desalination and Water Treatment 224 (2021) 421–432 426
As can be seen, the increase in temperature improves 
the adsorption process, which can be explained by the 
rise of the molecular speed and the collision against the 
surface of the adsorbent, leading to a greater amount of adsorbed dye at equilibrium. Nevertheless, the increase 
of q
t from 298 to 318 K does not exceed 8% according to 
Table 4, pointing out that 298 K may be a suitable condi-
tion for the process and its possible scale-up since, at this temperature, is involved fewer energy costs, at a minimum variation in the adsorbed dye.
In addition, it can be observed that at the beginning of 
the adsorption, q
t rapidly raises, and after approximately 
30 min, the adsorption becomes slower and increases up to 400 min, until finally about 700 min the process approaches to the equilibrium (Fig. 3). The above description allows 
to differentiate several stages; the first one corresponding 
to the adsorption of the external or instantaneous surface, 
where the molecules are directed from the solution to the external surface of the adsorbent; the second, in which the adsorbate diffuses within the pores of the material 
(intraparticular diffusion) generating a slowdown in the 
process; until reaching the third stage, the equilibrium, 
where the net interchange of adsorbate between the liquid and solid support is zero. It can also appreciate that the second and third stages have a small slope that could be 
fit to a straight line; however, this would not pass through Table 2

the origin, which implies that although there is intraparti-
cle diffusion, it is not the only limiting mechanism in the adsorption process, as reported by others authors [46–49].
Table 4 shows the parameters of the evaluated kinetic 
equations and their corresponding correlations using linear and non-linear regression.
The models that best represent the experimental 
data according to their correlation coefficient R
2 (non-lin-
ear) and the sum of square error, SSE, correspond to Elovich for 298 and 308 K, and pseudo-second-order for 318 K. These equations have also shown a good adjust-ment with this kind of pollutants [50,51]. It is worth mentioning that the adjustment to Elovich for 298 and 308 K suggests a chemical adsorption process, suitable for heterogeneous adsorption surface systems [52] 
and 
similarly, pseudo-second-order at 318 K implies that the limiting step involves a chemisorption where removal occurs by the interaction between the two phases [53].
3.3. Adsorption isotherms
Table 5 summarizes the results of both linear and 
non-linear adjustment of the equilibrium models with their 
respective parameters of DB2 adsorption onto CC. It was 
found that the Langmuir-Freundlich equation presents the 
best adjustment given by R
2 for the three evaluated tem-
peratures, with a value of 0.997 at 298 K (corresponding 
to the temperature with the highest capacity at equilib-rium), suggesting a monolayer adsorption process [54]. 
Figs. 4a–c show the experimental data and the model 
fitting for temperatures of 298, 308, and 318 K, respectively.
Although, the best fit was achieved with the Langmuir-
Freundlich equation, Freundlich’s model also had a good 
R
2 and an n value greater than one, suggesting that the 
adsorption of DB2 onto CC was a chemisorption and a favorable process. On the other hand, the dimension -
less parameter, separation factor R
L, characteristic of 
the Langmuir model [55] is given by Eq. (14).

concentration range of 5–4,000 ppm for all temperatures, in 
which values between 0 and 1.0 were obtained, supporting the favorability of this adsorption process.
Moreover, the Redlich-Peterson model represents the 
second-best fit after Langmuir-Freundlich equation, with an R
2 > 0.97 for all three temperatures. This fact suggests that 
this model, which modifies the Langmuir and Freundlich equations by adding a third parameter, can also adequately represent the DB2-CC system. In particular, a minimum deviation of 0.8% in the Redlich-Peterson R
2 with respect to 
Langmuir-Freundlich is observed at 318 K.
Table 6 shows the Qmax for direct dyes with different agri-
cultural by-products. It is worth mentioning that the CC used in this study has a higher adsorption capacity of DB2 com-pared to other agricultural by-products such as wheat shells or orange peel. This adsorbent offered even 47.7% higher capacity than the exhibited by activated carbon from orange peel in the adsorption of direct blue N 106 [62] (a compound with some structural similarity to DB2). Thus, CC constitutes a promising adsorbent for the treatment of water polluted with DB2 and probably for other dyes of this chemical nature.
3.4. Thermodynamics
The K values for each temperature were found by plot-
ting ln(q
e/Ce) vs. qe and extrapolating qe to zero [43]. The plots 
obtained are shown in Fig. 5, and the values are given in 
Table 7 with the other thermodynamic parameters.
Fig. 6 shows the experimental points of the isotherms and 
how the increase in temperature leads to a lower process effi-ciency since the amount of adsorbed dye decreases.
This behavior can be verified with the negative values 
obtained for enthalpy (Table 7), which point out that the process is exothermic and favorable, and may even occur at lower temperatures than those evaluated. On the other hand, the negative values of Gibbs free energy prove the spontaneous and feasible nature of the process where, at higher temperatures, the energy released is less, denoting the greater feasibility of the process at lower temperatures. The negative entropy found at the evaluated temperatures can be explained due to a decrease in randomness at the solution-solid interface during the DB2 adsorption onto CC. Despite the fact that this parameter is unfavorable, its value is relatively small, so that it does not affect the overall spon-taneity of the process [66]. It is worth noting that the value of entropy and enthalpy for the three evaluated temperatures is the same, since according to the used calculation method, these parameters are considered as characteristic proper -
ties of each reaction that do not change with temperature as occurs with the Gibbs free energy [43].
4. Conclusions
In this work, for the first time the CC agricultural 
by-product was evaluated as an alternative and novel 
adsorbent for the treatment of polluted effluents with DB2 
dye. A 2
3 full factorial design was performed to establish 
the best conditions of the adsorption process of this dye. It 
was found that CC owns a high adsorption capacity for the DB2 dye removal, reaching 88.3% efficiency under a dosage of 6.0 g L
–1, a dye concentration of 60 ppm, and a particle Table 4

size range of 0.3–0-5 mm. In order to optimize the process, 
a subsequent central composite response surface design 
was performed obtaining a maximum DB2 dye removal of 
89.81% at 60 ppm and 8.0 g L–1 and fixing the initial DB2 
concentration and the particle size of the previous design. These findings pointed out that the increase in the adsor -
bent dosage did not improve the process, since the percent-age of efficiency had a minimal increase. In this way, the removal of DB2 could be carried out satisfactorily using a smaller amount of adsorbent, which would allow to reduce the costs of the process. Under the optimal conditions, the maximum adsorption capacity obtained at 298, 308, and 318 K was 158.085, 132.043 and 101.841 mg g
–1 respectively, values higher than which reported for others agricultural by-products such as wheat shells or orange peel.
Regarding the evaluation of adsorption kinetics of DB2 
onto CC, the Elovich model showed the best description of the process at temperatures of 298 and 308 K, while at 318 K the pseudo-second-order equation offered the best fit. In the case of equilibrium, the Langmuir-Freundlich model corresponded to the best fit for the three evalu-ated temperatures, suggesting a monolayer process, with adsorption of a chemical nature. Furthermore, and in accordance with the values found for Gibbs free energy and enthalpy, the removal process of DB2 dye is sponta-neous and exothermic respectively (G  = –1435.41 J mol

value corresponding to a slight randomness at the interface

Finally, the great uptake capacity in the DB2 removal 
onto CC, together with the favorable conditions of the pro-cess, defined by the thermodynamic parameters, and the 
findings of the equilibrium and kinetics, allow suggest-
ing the feasibility of a posterior study of the process under 
continuous system with the future expectation of scal-ing up the process in order to contribute for solving the problem of treating effluents with persistent pollutants.
