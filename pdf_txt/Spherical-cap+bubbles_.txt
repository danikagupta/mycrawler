Abstract  - The pressure field around a spherical -cap bubble was divided into a spherical frontal and a wake region. The pressure field 
in each region was derived from the equatio n of motion. Due to the almost flat base of the bubble, the flow field of the wake was 
considered similar to that behind a circular disk. The calculated pressure distribution revealed the phenomenon of the bubble  skirt. The 
predicted pressure field of the spherical -cap bubble agreed well with the available experimental and theoretical results.

1. Introduction  
Spherical -cap bubbles are the last stage in evolution of the shapes of bubbles. Small bubbles start rising in spherical 
form then they deform into ellipsoidal shape due to the predominance of the inertia forces over the surface tension forces 
until they reach  the spherical -cap shape which is shown in Fig . 1.

Past research of spherical -cap bubbles have dealt primarily with determining the drag forces, rate of rise and thermal 
convection (e.g. Wegener and Parlange [1]; Kendoush [2]; Maxworthy et al. [3]). The research of the pressure field around 
the spherical – cap bubble is rather limited.  
Collins [4] proposed a model for the pressure distribution around the bubble by application of Bernoulli’s equation to 
a streamline on the bubble surface. This model was co nfined to the spherical frontal region of the bubble and does not 
cover the wake region.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
117-2 Lazarek and Littman [5] measured the pressure field around a circularly -capped air bubble which represents the 
two-dimensional version of the spherical -cap bubble. Thi s type of bubbles is normally found in a narrow rectangular 
cross -section water column. They also analyzed the frontal pressure field by using an irrotational flow model on an 
oval body. The effects of the finite distance between the bounding walls of the column were accounted for by infinite 
reflections of the source and sink using the method of images.  
In this paper detailed calculation of the entire pressure field, including the wake region of the spherical -cap bubble 
is presented, based on the solution of the equation of motion.  
 
2. THE FRONTAL SURFACE OF THE BUBBLE  
The flow field around the spherical -cap bubble is divided into two distinct regions as was done by Kendoush [2] 
in analyzing the rates of heat and mass transfer from the  surface of the spheri cal-cap bubble. The first region is the 
frontal where the upstream surface of the bubble forms a portion of a sphere so the flow in this region resembles that 
around the sphere. The second is the wake region where the bubble has an almost flat base and the  flow is 
approximated by that in the wake of a circular disk as shown in F ig. 2.

3. The Wake Region of the Bubble  
Many authors considered the base of the spherical -cap bubble as a flat surface. This will make the pattern of the 
flow analogous to that behind a circular disk (Kendoush [7]). Assume the cent er of the cir cular base of the bubble to 
be the origin of the cylindrical coordinates
R ,
,
Z. The velocity potential of the circular disk was given by Sparrow 
and Geiger [8] as follows

and 
      
Z2 2   
where 
Z  is the axial coordinate (aligned with 
wU ) . Note that 
m absin  and 
wU  is the main reverse velocity 
of the wake. The main assumption of using Eq. 10 as the velocity potential of the flow at the wake arises from the 
similarity in pattern to that of the upstream side as shown in F ig. 2. This assumption has been used with succe ss by the 
author in the treatment of the sphere hydrodynamics (Kendoush [9]) and the convective heat and mass transfer to the 
sphere (Kendoush [10]). An example on the verity of this assumption is the streamlines obtained from the numerical 
solution of Fro mm and Harlow [11].  
The radial velocity component of the reversed flow of the wake is obtained according to the following

4. Skirt Formation  
The skirt is a very thin envelope of gas trailing the spherical -cap bubble. It originates from the bubble rim and extends 
downstream the bubble as shown in F ig. 3. Many theories were presented for the explanation of this phenomenon.  
Shoemaker and Dechazel [12] related it to a trailing vortex. Guthrie and Bradshaw [13] proposed a theoretical model 
based on circulation of gas in the skirt envelope. In what follows a logical  basis is presented for the skirt formation. If the 
pressure coefficient of the wake is defined as 
 25.0/ )( )(w w w U P RP Cp   where 
wP  is the pressure at the rear 
stagnation point, then integrating Eq. 13 yields the following

Another version of this equation is given in the Appendix. Eq. 14 is illustrated in F ig. 3 after

through the following discussion  into 
Re . 
Lindt [14] found experimentally that the ratio

Re <
5000 . Narayanan, Goossens and 
Kossen [15] also found experimentally that this ratio was equal to 
15.0  for

Re <
80 . This means that 
  Re sin2.0 Rem w 
 for Lindt’s ratio and 
  Re sin15.0 Rem w   for Narayanan et al.’s ratio. When the 
characteristic length in

wRe  is changed from 
b2  to

er  is the equivalent radius and since

Re sin456.0 Rem w  

/ 2 Re Ure . Since

Re 3493.0 Re
 for Lindt’s ratio. Similarly, 
Re sin342.0 Rem   for Naraya nan et al.’s ratio.  
Fig. 3 offers a logical argument for the skirt formation. The suction pressure in the basal surface of the bubble 
increases in large proportions near the rim of the bubble causing the gas inside the bubble to be drawn downstream 
thus fo rming the skirt. This process will be enhanced in fluids with low surface tension.  
 
5. Discussion and Validation of Theory  
Davies and Taylor [16] presented experimental data on the pressure distribution over solid models similar in 
shape to the spherical -cap bubble. The results were given in terms of the pressure coefficient 
 2
0 5.0/ ),( U P aP Cp  
, where 
0P  is the pressure at the forward stagnation point. The prediction of these 
data necessitates the application of the equation of motion in spherical coordinates, thus

the integrand (

The above equation was derived on the basis of Bernoulli’s  theorem  that implies that viscous forces were insignificant. 
Contrary to the present results, Collins [4] and  Wairegi  and Grace [17] predicted high positive pressure at the bubble rim, 
which would oppose the tendency of skirt formation.  
 
Miksis, Vanden -Broeck and  Keller [19] utilized the theoretical derivation of Moore [20] for the pressure across the 
boundary layer over the frontal surface of the spherical bubble, which is given as follows†

This equation is analogous to Eq. 20 which is originally due to Moore [20] as both equations describe the angular 
distribution of the pressure on  the frontal surface of the bubble. The ratio of this equation to Eq. 21 yields

Fig. 6 shows a comparison between the ratio of Miksis et al. [19] and the above ratio, which indicates clearly that 
the conclusion of Miksis et al.[19] mentioned earlier was not precise. The present ratio (that is, Eq. 23) seems more 
comprehensive as it gives a functional dependence on Reynolds number as well as the angular position.  Note that, 
there is typographic erro r in Miksis et al.'s paper. The exponent of 
cos3/1  should be 3 instead of 2.  
 
 
6. CONCLUSIONS  
A method of calculating the pressure field around the spherical -cap bubble has been presented. This method 
divides the field into two distinct reg ions, a frontal and a wake region. Two irrotational inviscid flow models were 
used one for the front and the other for the wake. These models were incorporated into the equation of motion. The 
resulted pressure coefficient equations were compared  favourably with the available theoretical and experimental data.  
 
APPENDIX  
Another version of the pressure coefficient  
Integrating Eq. 13 starting from 
R  where the pressure is 
P  to any radial position on the surface of the 
circular base of the cap and adopting a pressure coefficient for the wake region yields
