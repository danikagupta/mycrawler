ABSTRACT
The discoloration of the fluorescent dye, Rhodamine B (Rhd B) by persulphate (KSP), was investigated by spectro -
photometric methods. The discoloration reaction of Rhd B by KSP is slow. It’ s first order with respect to Rhd B and KSP . 
It’ s effective at any pH and was found to increase linearly for pH< 4, temperature, and after addition of Fe(II) and Ag(I). 
The rate of discoloration remained the same after addition of Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II) and carbonate salts, but decreased 
after addition of ethanol and chloride salts. The TLC experiment showed the formation of colored intermediates. The 
activation parameters (Ea, ΔG#, ΔH# and ΔS#) of the discoloration reaction of Rhd B by KSP in absence and in presence 
of Fe(II) were calculated.

INTRODUCTION
    Textile industry produces a large amount of dyed 
wastewater. The non-biodegradable nature of the spent 
dye baths constitutes serious environmental problems [1].  
Rhodamine B (Rhd B), is one of the important xanthene 
cationic dyes, is largely applied in industry as a dye 
for paper, silk, wool, jute leather, cotton (Fig. 1). The 
xanthene dyes (Rose Bengal, Eosin Y and Rhodamine 
6G,…) are used also as fluorescent markers in struc -
tural microscopic studies, photosensitizers, and laser 
dyes. They have long been known to be toxic to insects 
(insecticide). They are harmful if swallowed by human 
and animals, and cause irritation to the skin, eyes and 
lung [2-3]. 
The main technologies available for the treatment of 
dyes involve the transfer of the pollutant from a liquid 
phase to another phase, concentrating the dye on an 
adsorbent (for example) so that it can later be discarded 
in a landfill or incinerated [4-5]. This phase exchange is not an ideal remedy. Destructive oxidation treatments 
provide more permanent solutions such as electrodeg -
radation [6, 7], photodegradation using TiO2 [8-13] are 
applied for removal of dyes (especially cationic dyes) 
from textile effluents. 
Chemical oxidation of contaminants by oxidants has 
been studied to develop novel remediation technologies: 
KBrO3 [14, 15], KClO3 [16], O3 [17], UV/O3 [18], acti -
vated O2 [19], Fenton’s reagent [20 -21], photo Fenton 
[22], H2O2 [23] have been widely tested in laboratory 
for the degradation of basic dyes. 
The use of persulfate (KSP) has recently been the 
focus of attention for an alternative oxidant in the chemi -
cal oxidation of contaminants [24-37].  It’s one of the 
strongest oxidants known in aqueous solution (Table 1) 
[27, 38]. It has great capability for degrading numerous 
organic contaminants through free radicals   (*
4SO−and 
*OH ) generated in the persulfate system [30, 31]. It of -
fers some advantages over other oxidants: Ease of stor -
age and transport, high stability, high aqueous solubility Journal of Chemical Technology and Metallurgy, 48, 4, 2013
358and relatively low cost. 
 Base activation [36, 37], UV-irradiation [25, 26, 
35], thermal activation [34, 39-41], metal activation 
[42-46], and soil mineral activation [30] have been used 
to generate a sulfate radical (Eo: 2.5- 3.1V), a stronger 
oxidant than persulfate (2.01 V) [41, 45]:

The present work is focused on the kinetic study of 
the discoloration of Rhd B (model molecule of xanthenes 
dye) with persulfate by UV- Visible spectrophotometry. 
The effect of various parameters such as initial pH, initial 
concentration of persulfate and Rhd B, transition met -
als concentration, and salts concentration was studied. 
A comparison between the degradation of Rhd B and 
Fluorescein (which has similar structure (Fig.1) with 
persulfate is undertaken to interpret better the results.
     
EXPERIMENTAL
Rhodamine B is used as purchased from Sigma 
(C28H31N2O3Cl, CAS: 81-88-9, MW: 479.02 g). The 
other chemical reagents used are from BDH (Analar or 
GPR). 20 mg L-1 (54.18 10−× M) of Rhd B solution is pre -
pared in distilled water in order to study its discoloration 
by KSP. The concentration of the dye in the reactional 
mixture is selected in such a way the absorbance of the 
dye at 560 nm followed Beer’s law. The concentration 
of KSP in the reactional mixture (0.01 M)  is selected in 
such a way the rate of the reaction is not very slow. The 
kinetic study of the discoloration of Rhd B by persul -
fate was carried on a double beam spectrophoto-meter, 
Specord 200 (Analytical Jena). 1 M of salt solutions 
(carbonate, chloride, and sulfate), and 0.1 M of transition metal solutions (Co(NO3)2, Ni(NO3)2, and CuSO4), were 
also prepared to study the matrix effect on the discolora -
tion rate. 5x10-2 M of AgNO3, FeII(NH4)2(SO4)2. 6 H2O, 
and 10-2 M of the surfactant (SDS) were also prepared 
for the same reason.  H2SO4 and NaOH solutions were 
used to study the effect of pH on the discoloration rate 
of Rhd B with KSP. 
Kinetic Study
The order with respect to Rhd B was carried out in 
the presence of a large excess of persulfate. The reac -
tional mixture was prepared as follows: x  ml (2 < x< 4) 
of 20 mg L-1 (50.93 10−× M< f [RhdB]  < 1.85x10-5M) 
of Rhd B, (7- x) mL of H2O and 2 mL of 5x10-2 M KSP 
([KSP]f: 0.11 M). 
The order with respect to persulfate was determined 
in the presence of different excess amounts of it, while 
the other parameters were kept constant: x  mL of 5x10-
2 M KSP (2 < x < 4) (7-x) mL of H2O and 2 mL of 20 
mg L-1 Rhd B (f [RhdB] :50.93 10−× M). Quickly after 
the addition of the dye, the absorbance of the solution 
was recorded every 1 min. during 60 minutes at 560 nm 
(λmax of Rhd B). The rate expression for the discolora -
tion reaction is:

Effect of initial pH
The effect of pH on the degradation rate was studied 
in presence of several concentrations of NaOH or H2SO4. 
The following mixtures were prepared for this purpose: 
2 mL of 20 mg L-1 Rhd B (f [RhdB] : 0.93x10-5 M), 2mL 
of 5x10-2 M of KSP (KSP]f: 0.11 M), 5 mL of the acid

Metal activation
Concerning the effect of metal salts, several ex -
periments were done at fixed concentration of KSP and 
Rhd B in the mixture as follow: 3 mL of 20 mg L-1 Rhd 
B ([Rhd B]f: 1.25x10-5 M), 2 mL of a predetermined 
concentration of KSP ranging from 5x10-2 M to 10-3 
M, x mL of Fe(II) (FeII(NH4)2(SO4)2). 6 H2O, or Ag(I) 
solution of the same initial concentration of KSP and 
(5-x) mL of water. 
Matrix effect 
The effect of salt such as KCl, Na2SO4, and Na2CO3 
(1 M), on the rate constant was carried out at sev -
eral concentrations of the mentioned salts by replacing 
some volume of water by the salt solution (x mL, with
5 0≤≤x ), while keeping the concentration of the oth -
ers reactants constant. The effect of the surfactant (SDS) 
and ethanol, on the discoloration rate were also studied 
in the same manner.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
UV-Visble spectroscopy and TLC Analysis
The visible spectrum of Rhd B decreases slowly 
with time especially the absorbance at 560 nm (maxλ of 
Rhd B). The general shape of Rhd B spectrum does not 
vary during its reaction with KSP. The reaction between 
Rhd B and KSP leads to total discoloration of Rhd B 
(Fig. 2a). The discoloration is very slow compared to 
that with crystal violet and malachite green [27]. The slow decrease in the intense peaks of Rhd B at 560 and 
260 nm is accompanied for the first time by an increase 
in the absorbance at 630, 470 and 370 nm (Fig. 2a, 2b). 
Then the decrease continues in the whole spectrum. 
The TLC study (Silica gel – pure ethanol) shows the 
appearance of two spots other than that of Rhd B: the 
lower one, orange less intense than the upper one (violet) 
(Fig. 3). The two color intermediate products disappear 
with time, in favors of two others intermediates with 
higher Rf. The Rhd B spot persists even after long time 
(one day) but its color faded, and then it disappears 
completely. The same behavior is observed with the 
other spots.  Finally the Rhd B/ KSP mixture become 
colorless. The discoloration of low concentration of Rhd 
B by KSP leads to the formation of colored intermedi -
ates undetectable clearly by UV-visible spectroscopy. 
The decrease in the whole UV - visible spectrum is 
probably a consequence of total mineralization of Rhd 
B. No blue shift (progressive decrease from 560 to 498 
nm) is observed during the discoloration as observed 
during the degradation of Rhd B under visible light ir -

360radiation by ZnxCd1-x S/TiO2 [47], and ZnCd/TiO2 [48].  
The degradation products of Rhd B are function of the 
oxidant used [49, 50]. There are several pathways for 
the Rhd B degradation:
N-deethylation (formation of Rhd B110), followed 
by deamination [49, 52]. 
Break in the chemical bond of xanthone molecule 
between the C1 and C15 atoms (elimination of the phe -
nyl ring containing COOH) leading to the formation of 
Pyronin G [50]. 
A break in the -O- bridge giving an intermediate 
having a similar structure to malachite green (increase 
in A630). 
Further degradation of these intermediate is possible 
[27, 51, 52]. 
Order with respect to Rhd B
Rhodamine B shows a strong absorption band at 560 
nm and follows Beer’s law for low concentrations (2– 8 
mg L-1). The relation found between the absorbance A560 
and Rhd B concentration in mg L-1 is ) (] [ 196.01−×= mgL RhdB A  
(mg L-1) R2: 0.993). The order with respect to Rhd B is 
not zero according to the plot of A560 vs. time (Fig.4a). 
The functions ln A and 1/A vary linearly with time. The 
constant kobs is the slope of the plot 
560lnA  or 
5601
A      vs time (app obsk k∞ ). For all the experiments concerning the determination  
with respect to Rhd B, the correlation coefficient (R2) 
for order one is closer to one than that for 2nd order. 
Order one is confirmed by applying the differential 
method ( ln 1.27 ln[Rhd B] 10.27ooV = ×− , R2: 1). The 
constant kobs remains the same with the increase in the 
dye concentration (42.9 10obsk−−= × ). Order one is also 
observed by discoloration of Rhd B by UV/KSP [29], by 
photo- Fenton reagent [22], and by photo-degradation 
in presence of TiO2 [9].
Order with respect to KSP 
The increase in KSP concentration increases the 
discoloration rate of Rhd B. For 10-3 M of KSP (in 
the mixture), the absorbance of Rhd B remained the 
same during 1 h, but with 10-2 M of KSP, the absorb -
ance decreases significantly. The rate constant (kobs) 
increases linearly with the increase in KSP concentration 
(410 200 [KSP]obsk×=× , R2: 0.983). So the order with 
respect to KSP is one. Order one is also observed for the 
degradation of crystal violet by KSP [27]. 
Effect of initial pH
Initial pH of solution had great effect on Rhd B 
degradation rate during −2
82O UV/S  system. Rhd B is 
stable in acidic and in basic medium, it does not loose 
its color with time in these mediums. Its maximum

361wavelength remained the same whatever the pH. The 
results showed that, the discoloration rate constant does 
not vary in neutral and in basic medium, but increases 
linearly with the decrease in pH for pH ≤ 4 (Fig. 4b). 
The radical *
4SO−is rather stable and more numer -
ous at low pH, while increasing system pH results in 
the transformation of *
4SO−to hydroxyl radical OH* (
**
42 4 SO H O OH SO H← − −++  → + + ) [29]. The acidic 
medium has positive effect on the Rhd B discoloration 
due to shift to right in the equilibrium of the reaction 
mentioned. The obtained result is in accordance with 
that obtained by action of UV/ KSP on Rhd B [29] and 
by action of KSP on Orange G [45].  
Matrix effect
Metal Activation
The chemical oxidation of organic pollutants by 
persulfate can be accelerated by metal ion activation, 
through enhancing sulfate radical generation. In the 
present case Ni(II), Co(II) and Cu(II) did not increase 
the discoloration rate constant, whereas the ions Ag (I) 
and Fe(II) accelerate it considerably (Fig. 5 and 6). For 
the same concentration of metal ion, Fe(II) decolor -
izes the mixture (Rhd B + KSP) faster than Ag (I). The 
discoloration behavior of Rhd B in presence of Fe(II) is somehow special:
The control mixture (presence of Fe(II) without 
KSP) shows no discoloration of Rhd B. For 5x10-2 M 
(or 5x10-3 M) as initial concentration of KSP and Fe(II): 
The decrease in Fe(II) concentration in the medium 
increases the discoloration rate (result not shown).  For 
the experiment done with 5x10-2 M of KSP and Fe(II), 
the mixtures with) Fe(II)/[KSP] ≥2, the discoloration 
is completely stopped, but for other mixtures with low 
ratio (≤ 0.5), the color disappears completely in less 
than 1 minute. 
The repetition of the experiment mentioned above 
with 5x10-3 M of KSP and 10-3 M of Fe(II) (instead 
of 5x10-3 M) as initial concentration showed differ -
ent attitude:  the discoloration rate increases with 
the increase in Fe(II) volume ( 0.3 ml < x < 4 ml or
553 10 M 4 10 M−−× −×  ) (Fig.5a). Linear relation is ob -
served between kobs and Fe(II) (R2: 0.97). This behavior 
is the opposite of that observed with higher concentra -
tions of KSP and Fe(II). 
Basing on this, we think about the existence of an 
optimum ratio of Fe(II)/[KSP]. This ratio corresponds 
to 1 when using 10-3 M as initial concentration of KSP 
and Fe(II) (2 ml of 10-3 M KSP + x ml of 10-3 M Fe(II)).

362The optimum ratio of  Fe(II)/[KSP] is also confirmed by 
varying the volume of 10-3 M KSP with respect to that of 
10-3 M Fe(II) (Fig.5b). There is scavenger effect [27, 45].
Concerning the effect of Ag(I), the control mixture 
(presence of Ag(I) without KSP) shows no discol -
oration of Rhd B. For an initial concentration of KSP 
(5x10-2 M), the addition of x ml of 5x10-2 M Ag(I) 
(0 ≤ x ≤ 5 ), the discoloration of Rhd B became very 
fast, and increased linearly with the increase of Ag(I) 
concentration. The repetition of the experiment with 
an initial concentration of KSP and Ag(I) equal to 0.01 
M gave the same results but the discoloration is slower                                                               
(50.226 [Ag ] 2 10obsk+−= × +× , with R2: 0.982) (Fig. 6). 
No Scavenger effect is observed with Ag(I) as was the 
case with Fe(II). Similar result is observed during the discoloration of crystal violet by KSP [27]. For another 
initial concentration of KSP and Ag(I) (2.5x10-3 M), the 
increase in Ag(I) concentration in the reactional mixture 
increases slightly the rate constant, whereas in the same 
conditions, the rate constant is higher with Fe(II). The 
order with respect to Rhd B in presence of Ag(I) becomes 
zero order, whereas it is rather 2 in presence of Fe(II), 
so the action of Ag(I) on the discoloration of Rhd B by 
KSP is different from that of Fe(II).  
Effect of wastewater constituents
The high redox potential of sulfate free radical 
makes it very reactive in destroying organic contami -
nants. However, parallel reactions with other species, 
could result in scavenging of sulfate radical and could 
possibly limit its oxidation efficiency. Competition for 
sulfate radical could be from wastewater constituents 
such as chloride ions, carbonate and phosphate [45]. The 
equations below show the chemical reaction mechanism 
of persulfate with chlorides in aqueous solutions [31]:

When chloride concentrations were less than 0.05 
M, presence of chloride ions had insignificant impacts 
on Rhd B degradation. However, beyond these concen -
tration levels, Rhd B degradation rates reduced signifi -
cantly with an increase in chloride concentrations (Fig. 
7a) The presence of sulfate or carbonate even in high 
concentration (0.5 M) did not reduce the discoloration

363rate significantly. Chloride was the ion that had the most 
negative effect. The reaction between sulfate and sulfate 
radical will generates sulfate radical. Similar results are 
observed with Lee et al. [31] and Soares et al. [12].
Effect ethanol and surfactant
Ethanol decreases the discoloration rate of  Rhd B.  Lin -
ear relation is observed between kobs and the volume of pure 
ethanol added ( 0.373 (ethanol) 1.87obskV= −× +  
with R2:0.985). The presence of SDS in low concentra -
tion (1x10-4 M - 4x10-4 M) did not affect the discoloration 
rate of Rhd B by KSP. The increase in SDS concentra -
tion did not allow the measurement of the absorbance 
accurately due to the micelle formation. 
Effect of Temperature      
The increase in temperature (15oC – 33oC) increases 
the discoloration rate of Rhd B (Fig.7b). The activation 
parameters associated with the discoloration are calcu -
lated according to Arrhenius and Eyring equations [27] 
(Table 2). The activation energy in presence of Fe(II) is 
lower than in its absence. The decrease in the activation 
energy in presence of Fe(II) confirms the catalyst effect 
of Fe(II) (metal activation). 
CONCLUSIONS
The discoloration of Rhd B is pseudo first order with 
respect to Rhd B and to persulfate. The discoloration in -
creases with temperature, in acidic medium, after addition 
of Fe(II) and Ag(I),   but decreases with the addition of 
NaCl and ethanol. There was no effect on the rate constant 
upon addition of Cu (II), Ni(II), or Co(II) and carbonate. 
Colored intermediate products are observed by TLC dur -
ing the discoloration.  The reaction of Rhd B with KSP 
leads probably to total mineralization of the dye.
