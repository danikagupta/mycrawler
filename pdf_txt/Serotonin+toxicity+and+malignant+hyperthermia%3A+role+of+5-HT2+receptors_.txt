2 VOL. 2, NO. 10 / OCTOBER 2003SEROTONIN TOXICITY AND 
5-HT2A RECEPTORS
I have some thoughts concerning
the article by Harvey Sternbach,MD, on serotonin syndrome(C
URRENT PSYCHIATRY , May 2003,
p. 14-24).
Greater emphasis on the 5-
HT2A receptor—both in researchand treatment—is justified.
1The
most recent evidence, which Dr.Sternbach may not have seen at press time, indi-cates that severe (life-threatening) cases of sero-tonin toxicity may benefit from 5-HT2A block-ers, such as cyproheptadine or chlorpromazine,rather than propranolol.
2,3
Based on recent data, it is difficult to confuse
neuroleptic malignant syndrome with serotonintoxicity . Thus, administering chlorpromazine insevere cases is rarely a clinical problem.
2,4In one
clinical trial, some 80 patients with moderatelysevere serotonin toxicity were safely and success-fully treated with chlorpromazine or cyprohep-tadine.
2
Recent animal studies have also demonstrat-
ed the efficacy of 5-HT2A blockers, but not ofpropranolol.
5,6
Knowledge of serotonin toxicity , or sero-
tonin syndrome, has become increasinglyimportant in psychiatry . Readers wishing toremain current should check out a just-pub-lished study
4from the toxicology research group
led by Ian Whyte, MBBS. The group’s data,from an analysis of 2,222 cases of serotonergicdrug poisoning, increase our understanding ofserotonin toxicity . Other d ata presented by 
Whyte and colleagues
3,4are summarized on 
my PsychoT ropical Research W eb site(www.psychotropical.com/SerotoninT oxicity .doc);some are available by searching
PubMed.

STAYING ‘CURRENT’
CURRENT PSYCHIATRY is germane and easy to
read. The articles offer the insight and depthmany professional publications lack.
I was impressed by Dr. Erik Nelson’s and
Dr. Susan McElroy’s article on atypical depres-sion (April 2003, p. 12-19) and your update onatypical antipsychotics (March 2003, p. 49-62). 
Y ou and your staff should be proud of the work
you do. W e in the field need to stay current, andyour publication is by far the best way to do it.Keep up the great work.
