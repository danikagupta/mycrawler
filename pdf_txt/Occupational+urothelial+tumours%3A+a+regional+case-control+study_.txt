   2 Abstract 
Importance 
Bladder cancer (BC) is a common malignancy that aris es through occupational 
carcinogen exposure. Here we analyse trends in UK t o better understand 
contemporary occupational BC.  
 
Objective 
To profile the contemporary risks of occupational BC  in the UK.  
 
Materials and methods 
Systematic review using PubMed, Medline, Embase and W eb of Science was 
performed in March 2016. We selected reports of Brit ish workers in which BC or 
occupation were the main focus, with sufficient case s or with confidence 
intervals (CI). We used the most recent data in populations with multiple 
reports. We combined odds ratios and risk ratios (R Rs) to provide pooled RRs of 
incidence and disease specific mortality (DSM) . We tested for heterogeneity and 
publication bias. We extracted BC mortality from Off ice of National Statistics 
death certificates. We compered across regions and with our meta-analysis. 
 
Results 
We identified 25 articles reporting risks in 702,941 persons. Meta-analysis 
revealed significant ly increased incidence for 12/37 and DSM for 5/37 
occupational classes . Three classes had reduced BC risks. The greatest ri sk of BC 
incidence occurred in chemical process (RR 1.87 (1.5 0-2.34)), rubber (RR 1.82 
(1.4-2.38)) and dye workers (RR 1.8, (1.07-3.04)).  The greatest risk of DSM  3 occurred in electrical (RR 1.49 (1.19-1.87)) and ch emical process workers (RR 
1.35 (1.09-1.68)) . BC mortality was higher in the North of England, pro bably 
reflecting smoking patterns and certain industries. Limitations include the lack 
of sufficient robust data, missing occupational task s and no adjustment for 
smoking. 
 
Conclusion 
Occupation al BC occurs in many workplaces and the risks for inci dence and DSM 
may differ. Regional differences may reflect changes in industry and smoking 
patterns. Relatively little is known about BC withi n British industry , suggesting 
official data underestimate the disease. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   4 Introduction 
Bladder cancer (BC) is the fourth commonest male malig nancy worldwide and 
the 9th commonest cancer within the UK [1]. Whilst the inci dence of BC in the UK 
has reduced in recent years, this cancer still repr esents the 6th most lethal 
malignancy in the UK and survival rates appear to be  deteriorating, in contrast to 
most other cancers [2].  The commonest cause of BC is  tobacco smoking, which 
accounts for about 50% of cases [3]. A recent meta- analysis [4] suggests that this 
is still a significant worldwide health problem desp ite legislature to prohibit 
smoking in public places and at work in many Western nations [5]. In the UK, 
tobacco smoking in public places was prohibited in 2 007 and the NHS promotes 
smoking cessation. However, despite knowledge about the adverse health 
outcomes of tobacco smoking, approximately 1/5 of the  UK population smok ed 
in 2014 [6].  
 
The second commonest cause of BC is occupational exp osure to carcinogens [3, 
7]. This aetiology is well known and has been subject  to health and safety 
regulations, such as the 2002 Control of Substances  Hazardous to Healt h 
Regulations in the United Kingdom [8].  In 1981 Dol l and Peto estimated that 
10% of BCs arose through occupational carcinogen ex posure [9]. This 
attributable fraction was recently re-calculated by  the Health and Safety 
Executive to have reduced to 5-7% in 2010 [10] . This risk calculation mostly 
uses exposure to recognised carcinogens in known in dustries . This method 
excludes poorly controlled, unknown or occult expos ures and so may 
underrepresent the true risks. Evidence of unrecogn ized carcinogen exposure 
may be derived from regional BC demographics that mirro r industrial  5 differences rather than smoking patterns. For example , in 2011 there were 11.1 
new BC cases per 100,000 in England and 8.6 in 100,000 in Northern Ireland 
[11] . Smoking rates in England and Northern Ireland are si milar [6], but there 
are marked industrial differences [12] . In the South West of England the 
respective number of persons smoking (% of total popu lation) has reduced from 
30% in 2000 to 17.3% in 2013 (the greatest reductio n in any region), whilst the 
incidence of BC has increased from 10% to 12% of th e overall UK total (924 to 
1075 cases) [11, 13].  
 
We recently reported apparent differences between D SM and BC incidence 
following occupational exposures using worldwide da ta [14, 15] . However, 
heterogeneity in smoking prevalence and industrial p atterns between nations 
may have limited these analyses. This global picture also lacked detail for 
individual countries. To overcome these issues, we now focus upon a single 
nation. We aim ed to profile occupational BC within the UK and to ident ify 
contemporary at risk populations. We hypothesise that this will help identify 
current carcinog ens and will aid better targeting of preventative and screening 
interventions. 
 
Materials and Methods 
Literature Search and Inclusion Criteria 
In May 2015 (initial) and March 2016 (updated) two authors independently (MC 
and JWFC) conducted a systematic search using PubMed , Medline, Embase and 
Web of Science. We included full-text articles publ ished or in press with no time 
or language limits applied. We used a variety of sea rch terms for occupation and  6 industry and either BC or urothelial/transitional c arcinoma (supp. table 1) . 
Abstracts of all reports were read and full papers retrieved that matched 
inclusion criteria. The methods used have been descr ibed previously [14] and 
are compliant with PRISMA reporting guidelines (sup p. table 2). 
 
Articles were eligible if they reported original da ta on occupational BC risk in 
adults working within the UK. Reports were mostly ca se control or cohort by 
design and were required to focus on occupational e xposures. Reports needed to 
have sufficient data to calculate confidence interv als (CI). We selected the most 
recent and maximally adjusted data from study populat ions with multiple 
datasets to ensure contemporaneity and to minimise con founding bias (e.g. 
tobacco smoking, gender, ethnicity or socio-economic  group).  
 
Meta-analysis  
Risk estimates were annotated by occupational class using Nordisk 
Yrkesklassficering or Nordic Occupational Classific ation (NYK), and International 
Standard Classifications of Occupations (ISCO- 1958 ) classifications [16]. For 
meta-analysis, we used manuscripts reporting risk est imates (e.g. odds ratio 
(OR), standardised incidence ratio (SIR), standardi sed mortality ratio (SMR) or 
relative risk (RR)) and 95% confidence intervals, o r enough information to 
calculate these.  
 
Meta-analysis was performed using a random effects mo del using STATA (Vsn. 
12.0). This model was chosen as we anticipated heter ogeneity between studies 
given that occupational BC reports are often from l arge populations with low  7 disease incidences and most reports are retrospectiv e and non-randomised. 
Heterogeneity was assessed using I2 between studies for each occupation. 
Publication bias was evaluated by visual inspection  of funnel pl otsǡ Eggerǯs linear 
regression [17] and Beggǯs rank correlation tests [18]. 
 
Calculating regional BC Mortality rates 
Age-standardised mortality rates in which BC was identified as the cause of 
death on the death certificate were calculated for 9 English Government Office 
Regions (GORs) from 1981 to 2014 using Office of Nat ional Statistics data . Prior 
to 1981 outcomes were collated in Standard regions not equivalent to GORs. 
Mortality rates were standardized against both a 19 76 and 2013 European 
Standard Population. Regional rates were presented relative to the lowest 
overall rate. 
 
Results 
We identified 2,844 reports from which we read 697 full manuscripts, and 
selected 25 for full inclusion (figure 1, table 1). The select ed manuscripts 
reported risks in 702,941 persons. These included 1 11 and 43 groups of workers 
for BC incidence and DSM, respectively, representin g 37 different NYK and ISCO-
1958 occupational classes. Most occupational classes had multiple reports of BC 
risk, including textile workers (n=10 separate repo rts). Funnel plots suggested 
symmetry for comparisons. Begg and Eggerǯs tests for publication bias were no t 
significant (supp. figures 1 and 2). 
 
Bladder Cancer Incidence  8 Chemical process (RR 1.87 (1.50-2.34), rubber (RR 1. 82 (1.40-2.38)) and dye 
workers (RR 1.80 (1.07-3.04)) had the highest signi ficant risks of BC . Other 
workers at significantly elevated risks occupations  were glass workers (RR 1.66 
(1.21-2.27)), waiters RR 1.30 (1.01-1.65), healthca re workers RR 1.16 (1.07-
1.26), nurses RR 1.15 (1.06-1.25), electrical worke rs 1.60 (1.09-2.36), smelters 
1.55 (1.07-2.25), domestics 1.49 (1.05-2.12) and tex tile workers 1.74 (1.45-
2.08). The highest pooled RR of BC incidence (table  2) was seen in fire fighters 
(RR 4.30 (95%CI 0.78-23.80)) and beverage workers ( RR 2.09 (0.34-12.88)), 
although these did not reach statistical significan ce. Three occupations had a 
statistically significant reduced pooled RR of BC i ncidence; artistic workers (RR 
0.66 (95%CI 0.47-0.92), warehouse workers (RR 0.48 (0.31-0.76) and drivers 
(RR 0.46 (0.28-0.75). 
 
Disease Specific Mortality 
Three occupations had a statistically significant i ncreased risk of DSM (table 3); 
electrical (RR 1.49 (95%CI 1.19-1.87)), chemical pro cess (RR 1.35 (95%CI 1.09-
1.68)) and transport workers (RR 1.15 (95%CI 1.03-1 .28)). Other occupations 
with elevated non-significant risks of DSM included  rubber workers RR 1.28 
(0.57-2.91), painters RR 1.27 (1.00-1.62), construc tion workers RR 1.20 (0.79-
1.81), military workers RR 1.15 (0.31-4.30) and bart enders RR 1.08 (0.75-1.56). 
Occupations with lower than expected DSM included c lerical workers (RR 0.89 
(95%CI 0.89-1.0)) and physicians (RR 0.45 (95%CI 0. 31-0.66)) (Figure 2, Supp. 
Table 4).  
 
Trends over time  9 Whilst we aimed to look at trends in occupational BC  over time, insufficient data 
prevented this for all occupations. 
 
Geographic trends in mortality from bladder cancer wit hin England 
We plotted mortality registrations from BC registere d in England from 1974 to 
2014 in males and females (Figure 3, see 
https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/ birthsdeathsandmar
riages/deaths/adhocs/005651numberofdeathsandagestand ardisedmortalityrat
eswherebladdercanceristheunderlyingcauseregionsofen glanddeathsregisteredb
etween1974and2014). Whilst changes in geographic re gions make comparisons 
over time difficult, we identified a marked decline i n BC mortality in the West 
Midlands and that in recent years the highest rates  were amongst males in the 
North East and North West. Occupational information was available for a 
minority of cases with registered BC mortality betwe en 2001 and 2014 (table 4, 
16,737/58,495 (28.6%)). Listed occupations included  those identified within our 
meta-analysis, e.g. electrical and transport workers , and those found elsewhere 
e.g. metal, construction and domestic workers [14, 1 5]. 
 
Discussion 
Here we profile contemporary BC within the UK using  outcomes in over 700,000 
persons and death certificate data. We observed cha nging demographics of the 
disease that might reflect manufacturing and legislat ive changes, and that have 
implications for efforts to improve workplace safety . Firstly, we found some 
similarities with previous reports of occupations at  risk of BC (e.g. [8]). Historical 
series reported the highest risks in workers expose d to aromatic amines in  10 rubber, dye and textiles workers. In the UK, many of  these were employed 
around the West Midlands in automobile manufacture an d exposed to the rubber 
anti -oxidant Ⱦ-naphthylamine (2-naphthylamine) through tyre product ion. 
However, our calculated relative risks are lower th an previous reports (e.g. RR 
1.80 versus 2.90 [19] for dye workers, RR 1.82 vers us 3.03 [20] [21] for rubber 
workers) suggesting robot use in automobile manufactu re, replacement of 
known carcinogens and the geograph ical relocation of industries has improved 
safety . Whilst these events may partly explain the absolute and relative decline 
in BC mortality across the West Midlands (figure 3),  smoking rates in this 
regions are some of the lowest in the UK (around 17% )[6]. 
 
Secondly, our findings support previous reports tha t the industries at risk of BC 
incidence and mortality can differ [14, 15]. The highest observed  DSM rates 
within our meta-analysis occurred in electrical, che mical and transport workers 
and were supported by observations from English dea th certification details 
(table 4). Within the UK, some of the at risk indus tries are commonly located in 
the North (such as chemical manufacture and transport  workers (HGV drivers)) . 
As smoking rates are high in the North East and Nort h West (around 19% 
prevalence [6]), it is likely that the geographic p atterns are multifactorial. Some 
occupations with high DSM are ubiquitous throughout  the UK (e.g. electrical 
workers and painters) and include multiple exposures . Electrical workers are 
exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons through their handling of metals, 
anode vapour, and soldering fumes. Such occupations make poor choices for 
targeted screening. In the mean time whilst our findi ngs do not test the role of 
screening high-risk workers, it seems reasonable to suggest a low threshold for  11 urological assessment in workers within the electric al, chemical, rubber, 
transport, and metal industries presenting with mixed  urinary symptoms . 
Furthermore, this data will hopefully inform (but i s unlikely to change) UK 
compensation law in the short term, however, it does  highlight the pertinence of 
accurate occupational histories. In addition, patie nts can be directed towards 
renumeration services such as the Industrial injuries and disablement benefits 
scheme [22]. 
 
Thirdly, our analysis reveals that there are few hi gh quality reports of 
occupational BC in the UK. For example, we were unab le to compare risks over 
time for all occupations  (i.e. to see if changes in  legislation had made an impact) , 
and we could not examine DSM in common occupations p reviously reported to 
have high mortality rates in other countries or in t he UK death certificates (such 
as metal workers, dry cleaners) [14, 15] . Furthermore, occupational details are 
unavailable on many British death certificates. This  may be due to incomplete 
recording at the time of death registration  or that most deaths occurred in 
retired workers ( and so Ǯnoneǯ was often recorded as their current o ccupation ). 
As such, our findings suggests that many occup ational BCs in the UK are misssed 
[10] . Nearly all BCs arise following exogenous carcinogen exposure (al beit with 
some genetic predisposition). As smoking is estimated  to be the aetiology for 
only 50% of BCs, it is plausible that occupational exposures (perhaps using 
unknown carcinogens, known carcinogens in unknown r oles [23] or indirectly 
through environmental pollution) must contribute to a  large proportion of the 
remaining cancers. Our report suggests the need for further primary research 
and vigilance by treating physicians to detect thes e exposures. We were able to  12 observe reductions in BC risk amongst drivers over t ime (a reduction from RR 
0.52 to 0.49 from 1950 to 1990), although data was limited and not statistically 
significant. This may reflect clean er diesel fumes [17] or trends in cigarette 
smoking. Contrary to this, the overall risk profile of occupational BC in the UK 
does seem to be on a slightly upward trend in risk s ince the ͳͻͷͲǯsǡ with a spike 
in the 1960s (figure 5). 
 
Conclusions 
Here we have profiled contemporary occupational BC i n the UK. We found a 
reduction in incidence risk from previous reported rates and that many 
occupations continue still have elevated risks. The  profile of occupations at risk 
of BC appears to differ from those at risk of dying  from BC. Further work is 
needed to better understand the contribution of occ upational tasks to BC 
aetiology and to reduce workplace exposures.

Figure 4. Regional trends in standardized mortality from bladder cancer from 
1974 to 2014 in (a). Males and (b). Females. Rates a re presented relative to those 
in South East (lowest). Data were collated in stand ard regions from 1974 to 
1980, then in GOR from 1981-2014. Although aligned for illustrative purposes, 
these regions are not entriely equivalent. For examp le, London was included in 
the South East until 1981, East Anglia was discrete  from the East until 1981. 
Given this, we have plotted relative rates to show trends rather absolute values.
