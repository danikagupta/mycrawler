Abstract
Marine debris represents an important threat for sea turtles, but information on this topic is scarce in some areas, such as the
Mediterranean sea. This paper quantiﬁes marine debris ingestion in 54 juvenile loggerhead sea turtles ( Caretta caretta ) illegally
captured by ﬁshermen in Spanish Mediterranean waters. Curved carapace length was measured, necropsies were performed and
debris abundance and type was recorded. Diﬀerent types of debris appeared in the gastrointestinal tract of 43 turtles (79.6%), being
plasticsthemostfrequent(75.9%).Tar,paper,Styrofoam,wood,reed,feathers,hooks,lines,andnetfragmentswerealsopresent.Aregression analysis showed that the volume of debris increased proportionally to the size of the turtles. The high variety of debris
found and the large diﬀerences in ingestion among turtles indicated low feeding discrimination of this species that makes it specially
prone to debris ingestion. Our data suggest that more severe control of litter spills and greater promotion of environmental edu-cational programmes are needed in the Western Mediterranean. /C2112002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
Sea turtles are currently threatened in all life stages
both on nesting beaches and at sea due to human im-pact. One of the main anthropogenic threats is marinepollution, including marine debris, oil spills and bio-
accumulative chemicals (Hutchinson and Simmonds,
1991).Pelagicjuvenilesarefrequentlyexposedtomarinedebris in convergence zones and most species are ex-posed in nearshore habitats where they feed (Bjorndal,1997).Theloggerheadseaturtle Carettacaretta seemsto
be one of two sea turtle species that ingest more debris,in all its life stages,most likely because of its habitat andfeeding behaviour (Lutcavage et al., 1997).
The physical and chemical eﬀects on sea turtles
caused by marine debris are well described in the liter-ature (National Research Council, 1990; Hutchinsonand Simmonds, 1991). These eﬀects may not be lethal atlow ingestion levels; however, both can cause side eﬀects
that may increase the probability of death (Hutchinsonand Simmonds, 1991). An example of such side eﬀects isnutrient dilution, which occurswhen non-nutritive itemsdisplace food in the gut, aﬀecting the nutrient gain andconsequently the growth and/or the reproductive output
(McCauley and Bjorndal, 1999).
Information about solid debris ingestion by sea tur-
tles in the Mediterranean sea is scarce (Gramentz, 1988;Venizelos and Smith, 1997). In the Western Mediterra-nean, data are limited to occasional observations ofisolated individuals (Salvador, 1978; Delaugerre, 1987).However, knowledge of the eﬀects of human activitieson sea turtles populations from these waters is necessary
for two reasons. First, conservation of foraging habitats
is considered a priority for population management andsurvival in sea turtles (Bjorndal, 1999). Western Medi-terranean waters provide important feeding grounds forjuvenile loggerheads from two diﬀerent rookeries, theEastern Mediterranean and Western Atlantic (Laurentet al., 1998). Second, the survival of large juveniles hasan important eﬀect on population growth (Crouse et al.,

PII: S0025-326X(01)00236-31987) and the waters around Spanish Mediterranean
islands host a small permanent stock of large juveniles
and adult loggerheads (Cami ~nnas and de la Serna, 1995).
Tourism and ﬁsheries have deleterious eﬀect on seaturtle stocks in the Western Mediterranean, because oftheir serious contribution to land-based and sea-basedlitter spills. The loggerhead sea turtle is currently clas-siﬁedas‘‘vulnerable’’bytheIUCN(InternationalUnionfor the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources,
the World Conservation Union), but it was suggested to
be considered as ‘‘endangered’’ in the Mediterranean(Broderick and Godley, 1996).
The ﬁrst objective of the present study was to gain
knowledge on debris ingestion by loggerhead turtles inthe Spanish Mediterranean waters, through its quanti-ﬁcation in a relatively large sample. Second, we wantedto see if there was an ontogenetic trend in the amount of
debris ingested testing whether the smaller turtles are
more aﬀected than the larger ones. Finally, because ithas been demonstrated that these turtles use both ben-thic and pelagic habitats for feeding (Tomas et al.,2001a), we analysed whether they are exposed to dif-ferent sources of debris at the bottom, surface and alongthe water column. Chemical eﬀects of marine debris arenot considered in this study.
2. Material and methods
The present study is based on 54 juvenile loggerhead
sea turtles intended for illegal human consumption andseized by the Catalan Autonomous Police in Barcelona(Spain). Therefore, speciﬁc information about dates and
zones of capture is not available. However, it seems that
the turtles were incidentally caught by trawling nets onthe coast of Northeast Spain (Guitart et al., 1999). Thisassumption is supported by the size distribution, corre-sponding with the turtles incidentally captured andstranded at Spanish Mediterranean (Aguilar et al., 1995;Pont and Alegre, 2000), the prey species found (Tomaset al., 2001a) and the similarity of the parasite fauna
to other C.carettafrom the Western Mediterranean
(Aznar et al., 1998). Biometric variables were measuredduring the necropsies (details in Tomas et al., 2001a).Debris and substratum (sand and stones) were collectedfrom oesophagus, stomach and intestine. Total debrisand types of debris were quantiﬁed by the frequency ofoccurrence of items longer than 1cm and the absolutewet volume to the nearest 0.5 ml. We assume that
smaller items resulted from fragmentation of larger ones
inside the turtles or from incidental ingestion.
Our sample consisted of the size ranges listed in the
literature to include ontogenetic dietary shift, frompelagic to benthic habitats (Laurent et al., 1998). How-ever, despite having a relatively wide range of CCL(curvedcarapacelength)(mean ¼49:4/C68:98cm,range:34–69 cm), our turtles seemed to belong to the same
stage, as reﬂected by their dietary composition and
feeding behaviour (Tomas et al., 2001a) or by theirsimilar fatty acid composition in fat and liver tissue(Guitart et al., 1999). For this reason, and because thisontogenetic shift does not occur in one step (Laurentet al., 1998; Tomas et al., 2001a), a least-square regres-sion analysis was performed to explore possible ten-dencies of debris ingestion with body size. CCL (as a
measure of size) was used as independent variable and
the volume of all kinds of debris was used as the de-pendent variable. Both variables were log-transformed(+1). All debris, even the wood and reed fragments andseabird feathers cited in the literature as ‘‘natural de-bris’’, were considered together in the analyses becauseall them can be ingested equally and can cause similarphysical damage and nutrient dilution eﬀects. Statistical
analyses were performed with SPSS 9.0 and statistical
signiﬁcance was set at the 0.05 level.
3. Results
Forty-three of the 54 turtles (79.6%) had debris in
their digestive tracts. A high number of these turtles
showedsmallamountsofdebris(lessthan20ml)(Fig.1).
The outlier of the volume distribution of debris corre-sponds to one turtle containing 199 ml of sand and 1 mlof a plastic piece. Wereportmore than 10 diﬀerent typesof debris in the 43 turtles with marine debris (Table 1).Twenty-seven(62.79%)ofthese43individualsswallowedmore than one type of debris (mean number of types perturtle ¼2.51, S.D. ¼1.75, range: 1–8). The great diﬀer-
encesofdebrisingestionbetweenturtleswerereﬂectedby
the fact that the standard deviations were greater thanthemeanofvolumeandnumberofitemsforallthetypesof debris. Anthropogenic debris appeared in 41turtles,

shape and colour. Tar was also common in the digestivetractofturtles,but44.2%ofthetarvolumewasfoundinone single animal. Other diﬀerent types of debris hadlower occurrence (Table 1). The high volume of sub-stratum was due mainly to the contents of the digestivetract of two turtles.
Marine debris appeared in the intestine, particu-
larly in the last sections, in higher proportion than in
the stomach (77.8% of mean percentage of volume ofdebris in intestine per turtle vs. 22.2% in the stomach; t-
test: t¼/C05:765, df ¼42,p<0:001). Debris entered in
similar proportion as the prey items (mean percentageof debris items with respect to the total ¼41:56%,
S:D:¼28:59) and both types of items appeared mixed
inthedigestivetracts. The volume ofalldebris increased
with CCL (Slope ¼2:76,F
ð1;52Þ¼8:67,p¼0:005). The
slope of the regression line did not diﬀer from 3(t-test
0:05ð52Þ¼/C00:249, p>0:5).
No signiﬁcant diﬀerences in size (CCL) were found
between the turtles with and without substratum ( t-test:
t¼0:139, df ¼41, p>0:5), and no correlation was
found between volume of ﬂoating plastics and CCL inour sample. ( r¼0:250, p>0:05).
4. Discussion
The present study reports a high frequency of ma-
rine debris compared to other studies with similar sam-ple size of C.carettaand other sea turtle species, even if
we consider only the anthropogenic debris (Table 2).
However, in terms of volume and number of items per
turtle, our results agree with other quantitative studies(e.g., Bjorndal et al., 1994). As in the present study,plastic is the most reported debris in marine turtles andother marine animals. Plastic may be disposed of at seain similar proportions to other types of debris, but it hasahighworldwideuse,especiallybymariners(Laistetal.,
1999); moreover, due to its lightweight and its environ-mental persistence, plastic is the most common humandebrisfoundinthesea(VenizelosandSmith,1997;Laistet al., 1999).
Sea turtles, and especially the loggerhead, demon-
strate great resistance to debris ingestion in accordancewith the apparent low mortality reported in the litera-
ture (e.g., Plotkin and Amos,1988;Bjorndalet al., 1994;
Shaver and Plotkin, 1998). Our analysis showed nolethal eﬀect caused by the debris. No clear evidence ofdigestive tract blockage was observed during the necr-opsies, despite the high amounts of marine debris foundin six of the turtles (see Fig. 1). This fact, together withthe presence of debris preferably in the lasts sections ofintestines, indicate that most of the items pass through
the digestive tract of the turtles. Only sharp-pointed
objects are specially prone to hook up on the gut, as didthe 9 cm hook perforating the stomach of one of ourturtles, that might have caused its dead (however, it ispossible that this turtle was captured still alive by ﬁsh-ermen). Hooks of long-line ﬁsheries represent a greatthreat for sea turtles, causing thousands of deaths inWestern Mediterranean (Aguilar et al., 1995; Tomas
et al., 2001b). No physical eﬀects caused by tar were
detected during the necropsies. Nonetheless, determin-ing whether marine debris is responsible for the death ofsea turtles by digestive tract obstruction is often diﬃcult(Bjorndal et al., 1994).
Sublethal eﬀects caused by debris ingestion, such as
dietary dilution, may aﬀect the sea turtle populationin the long-term (Bjorndal, 1997). Dietary dilution is
caused by a wide variety of non-nutritive items, i.e.,
anthropogenic debris, but also non-digestible naturaldebris. This side eﬀect can be signiﬁcantly detrimental ifsuﬃcient gut capacity is appropriated to debris(McCauley and Bjorndal, 1999). In the case of smallerindividuals, dietary dilution may represent an importantTable 1

aOther anthropogenic debris.J. Tom /C19aas et al. / Marine Pollution Bulletin 44 (2002) 211–216 213threat because of their faster saturation and their lower
ability to increase intake to meet their energetic andnutritional requirements (McCauley and Bjorndal,1999). Despite of the low amounts of debris found inmost of our turtles (Fig. 1), we cannot reject that dietarydilution did occur in our sample because of the similarproportions of debris and prey items found. The com-parison of the slope in the regression analysis suggests
thattheamountofdebrisincreasesproportionallytothe
volume of the turtles (measured as CCL
3). Thus, the
amount of marine debris is proportionally equal in ourturtles. This result reveals that an important factor de-termining the amount of debris in the turtles is the CCL,as occurs with preyingestion. Swallow capacity ishigherin the larger turtles because of their longer digestivetracts, their higher energetic requirements and their
ability to exploit more dietary resources (Tomas et al.,
2001a, and references therein). The question is knowingwhether the proportional ingestion of debris to the sizeproduces the same detrimental eﬀect. This may dependon the existence among turtles of diﬀerences in theirability to compensate dietary dilution by increasing in-takes.Moreresearchisneededtodeterminewhetherthisability increases with size and age in loggerheads; if this
tendency exists, larger turtles would be less aﬀected by
ingestion of small amounts of debris (not exceeding thegut capacity) (McCauley and Bjorndal, 1999). Pelagicloggerheads may have this ability limited because oftheir higher diluted diet, based on low-nutritive organ-isms, such as jellyﬁsh or salps (McCauley and Bjorndal,1999). Higher-nutritive prey species, such as ﬁsh, ceph-alopods, crabs and molluscs, were found mixed with
debris in turtles of all sizes (within the range of CCL
analysed) in the present study (Tomas et al., 2001a).However analyses of nutrient gains are necessary toexplore possible increasing in intakes to compensatedietary dilution by debris. Nevertheless, wider range ofsizes, including adult individuals, must be analysed tosee whether debris ingestion decreases, absolutely or
proportionally, when energetic requirements are lower.In addition, retention of debris, which can remain in thegutformonths(Lutz,1990),mightincreasetheobservedamounts in larger turtles with larger intestines.
It is well known that pelagic juveniles from all sea
turtle species have higher incidence of debris ingestion,because of their indiscriminate pelagic feeding strategy
(Bjorndal, 1997). Dietary studies show that all our tur-
tles seem to belong to the same development stage,feeding in all marine strata in an opportunistic way(Tomas et al., 2001a). This was conﬁrmed by our resultsabout substratum and plastic ingestion. Our range ofsizeswastoosmalltoﬁndabsoluteorrelativediﬀerencesin debris ingestion between strictly pelagic and largerbenthic juvenile loggerheads, and to establish whether
the tendency observed is due to the reasons exposed
above. We must take into account that Western Medi-terranean waters host subadult loggerheads from twodiﬀerent populations exploiting diﬀerent habitats (Lau-rent et al., 1998), and our sample might include indi-viduals from both populations.
Several authors have suggested that active debris in-
gestion occurs by mistake due to its similarity to prey
species, such as jellyﬁsh (Mrosovsky, 1981; Gramentz,
1988; Plotkin et al., 1993; Duguy et al., 2000). Thishypothesis assumes that the turtles are able to discrim-inate shape and colour in some manner. However, suchhypothesis hardly explains the presence of some debrishighly diﬀerent from any prey species. Our results (i.e.,the similar proportions of debris and prey intake, thevariety of debris types in the sample and the great dif-
ferences in debris ingestion between turtles) supportthat
low discrimination exists in the feeding of these animals.Studies from other areas also report marine debrisvarying greatly in consistency, shape and colour in thedigestive contents of loggerheads (Van Nierop and denHartog, 1984; Delaugerre, 1987; Witherington, 1994).Table 2

turtle (Tomas et al., 2001a), a strategy of low prey dis-
crimination could be adaptive in unpolluted seas; how-ever, the increase of anthropogenic debris in the searesults in the accumulation of debris in this species,causing important lethal or sublethal eﬀects. Nonethe-less, more experimental research in olfactory and visualsensitiveness is necessary to investigate perceptual dis-crimination by loggerhead turtles.
Due to the high occurrence of debris ingestion by
turtles from the Western Mediterranean Sea detected inthe present study, a greater control of both land-basedand sea-based litter spills in these waters becomes nec-essary. Also speciﬁc educational programmes impartedto beginners and advanced sailors in sailing schools, andalso to ﬁshermen, could help to reduce the high preva-lence of this particular problem in the Mediterranean
sea waters.
