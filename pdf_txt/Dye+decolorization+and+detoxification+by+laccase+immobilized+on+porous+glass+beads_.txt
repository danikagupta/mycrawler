The decolorization and detoxiﬁcation of textile dyes by fungal laccase immobilized on porous glass beads
were evaluated. Anthraquinone (Reactive blue 19 and Dispersed blue 3) and indigoid (Acid blue 74) dyes
were degraded more rapidly than the azo dyes (Acid red 27 and Reactive black 5). There was no dye sorp-tion to the enzyme bed when decolorization rates were high (>12
lM dye/U-h) but at moderate rates (8
to >0.06 lM/U-h), there was a transient color which disappeared upon prolonged exposure. With Reactive
black 5, permanent adsorption occurred most likely because laccase had been totally inactivated. Althoughlaccase treatment was more efﬁcient at decolorizing the anthraquinone dyes, their toxicity (as determinedby the Microtox assay) increased while the less efﬁciently decolorized solutions of azo and indigoid dyes
became less toxic. These results demonstrate the potential and limitations of using immobilized laccase to
enzymatically decolorize a range of different dye classes and reduce dye toxicity in a single step.

1. Introduction
When textile mill efﬂuents are discharged to receiving waters,
dyes are visible pollutants at concentrations of 0.005 mg/l (O’Neill
et al., 1999 ). Although some dyes and/or their degradation products
are toxic and potential carcinogens (Moawad et al., 2003 ), all reduce
the amount of sunlight to photosynthetic organisms resulting in de-
creased oxygen levels in aquatic ecosystems. Physical color removal
methods (such as activated carbon and coagulation) require subse-
quent disposal steps as the dyes are transferred to a different phase.
Chemical methods can eliminate dyes but reagents are added and,
in some cases, may generate undesirable by-products. Domestic
activated sludge processes are ineffective at dye removal because
the microbial consortia are typically not capable of degrading tex-
tile dyes that are adsorbed on the cell membrane (Rosa et al.,
2001; Hassan et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2002 ).
A promising biological treatment is the use of white rot fungi
(Asgher et al., 2008; Kaushik and Malik, 2009 ). Their extracellular
enzymes including peroxidases and laccases have decolorized dyesin liquid cultures ( Kirby et al., 2000; Champagne and Ramsay,
2005; Husain, 2006; Wesenberg et al., 2003 ). Immobilization of
these enzymes is potentially more cost-effective as it would allow
their re-use and may improve enzyme stability. Although puriﬁed
fungal laccases have been shown to decolorize azo (Salony et al.,
2006 ), acid ( Salony et al., 2006; Ben Younes et al., 2007 ) and
anthraquinone (Lu et al., 2007; Ben Younes et al., 2007 ) dyes, most
studies using immobilized laccase have evaluated their ability toremove pollutants such as pesticides and phenols from synthetic
wastewaters ( Yinghui et al., 2002; Jolivalt et al., 2000 ).
Dye decolorization using laccase immobilized on imidazol-
modiﬁed silica gel (Peralta-Zamora et al., 2003 ) or silanized alu-
mina particles ( Zille et al., 2003 ) occurred mainly by adsorption,
and to a lesser extent, by enzymatic decolorization. More recently,
Champagne and Ramsay (2007) demonstrated that laccase immo-
bilized on controlled porosity carrier (CPC) glass beads usingAPTES-glutaraldehyde decolorized a single anthraquinone dye,
Reactive blue 19, mainly by enzymatic degradation. However,
decolorization of other dyes was not evaluated.
There are few reports on the detoxiﬁcation of dyes decolorized
by fungal cultures (Ramsay and Nguyen, 2002; Shin et al., 2002 ),
and even fewer on dyes decolorized by free or immobilized laccase(Abadulla et al., 2000 ). Although both the culture and the puriﬁed
enzymes generate decolorized dye products, fungal cultures alsoproduce numerous metabolites and enzymes that can result in a
toxic effect different from decolorization by enzymes alone. This
study examines whether Trametes versicolor laccase immobilized
on CPC-silica beads could decolorize a wider range of dye classes(speciﬁcally, Disperse blue 3 (anthraquinone dye), Acid blue 74
(an indigoid dye) and Acid red 27 and Reactive black 5 (two azo
dyes)) than just Reactive blue 19 and the effect of enzymatic treat-
ment on detoxiﬁcation.

19, Reactive black 5 and 2,2’-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-
sulfonic acid) (diammonium salt) were purchased from Sigma–Al-
drich (Oakville, ON, Canada). Dispersed blue 3, Acid blue 74 and
glutaraldehyde were purchased from Acros (Belgium).
2.2. Immobilization of laccase on controlled porosity carrier (CPC)
silica beads
Laccase was immobilized on pre-silanized silica beads accord-
ing to Champagne and Ramsay (2007) . Four grams of pre-silanized
CPC-silica beads (355–600 lm in diameter, an average surface area
of 42.1 m2/g and a pore size of 37.5 nm) were immersed in de-gassed 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M KH 2PO4at pH 5.0 for 2 h
and thereafter placed in a laccase solution (/C243 U/ml in 0.1 M
KH2PO4pH 5.0) for 36 h at 4 /C176C. The beads were then washed three
times with distilled water and twice with phosphate buffer.
2.3. Enzyme assay
Laccase activity was measured spectrophotometrically by the
generation of 2,20-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)
radicals (ABTS/C15/C0) at 420 nm from the oxidation of ABTS (Wolfen-
den and Wilson, 1982 )a t2 3±1 /C176C using a Spectramax 250 plate
reader with the SOFTmax/C210PRO software package (Molecular De-
