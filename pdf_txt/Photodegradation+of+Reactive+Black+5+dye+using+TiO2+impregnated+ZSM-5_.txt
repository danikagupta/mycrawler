Abstract  
 
Textile industries use different synthetic dye and generate huge volume of textile effluent containing complex mixtures of ma ny 
polluting substances.  The removal of colour from textile wastewater represents a major environmental concern.  In this work,  the 
removal of reactive black 5, a textile dye, from aqueous solution has been studied using photocatalysis in a UV annular react or 
using TiO2 as catalyst. Photocatalysis is the acceleration of a photoreaction in the presence of a semiconductor catalyst . In this 
work, effects of reactor operating time, flowrate, solution pH on percent demineralization of dye has been studied. A 94% dye  
removal was achieved in near neutral solution (pH=6.4) compared to 75% removal in case of alkaline medium (pH=8.4). The 
kinetic of the photo -reaction has been found to fo llow Langmuir -Hinshelwood model .

I. INTRODUCTION  
Industrial effluents are one of the most important sources of pollution in the environment. The dye effluents from textile in dustries 
are significant sources of environmental pollution [1]. Synthetic dyes have been used in many industries such as textile, paper 
printing, food, pharmaceutical, leather and cosmetics [2]. Traditionally, synthetic dyes are classified into acid, reactive, direct, 
basic, metal complex, and sulphur dyes.  
Reactive black 5 (RB -5) like other  reactive dye have good fastness propertie s owing to the bonding that occurs during dyeing.  
RB-5 is an azo dye.  Azo dyes, have one or more azo bonds ( -N=N -) and because of their solubility, low expense, stability and 
color variety, are widely used in many applications [3]. Removal of azo dyes fr om colored effluents due to their complex 
composition, toxicity, poor degradability and high solubility, have attracted great interest in the last few years [4]. Conve ntional 
methods such as chemical precipitation and biological treatment cannot effectivel y remove of dyes from effluents, so finding an 
effective technique is necessary.  
The purification of wastewater by heterogeneous photocatalysis is one of the most rapidly growing areas of interest to both 
research workers and water purification plants. Com mercial application of the process is called advanced oxidation process  
(A.O.P). In recent years, TiO 2 has been chosen as a photocatalyst for the destru ction of polluting materials due to its efficiency, 
non toxicity, high activity, photochemical inertness and low cost [5]. In some recent work, photocatalytic degradation of rea ctive 
black -5 dye using TiO 2 impregnated ZSM -5 was investigated in a batch reac tor [6]. With some optimum formulation of supported 
catalyst, 98% degradation of 50mg/L RB -5 solution was obtained in 90 minutes.  
Hosseinia et.al.  [7] has synthesized nanosize TiO 2 particles and investigated photocatalytic degradation of different 
chromop hores under visible light irradiation at different catalyst loading and different dye concentrations. In another work [8] 
phenol degradation had been  examined with combined photocatalysts TiO 2 and ZnO under illumination of a 500W super high 
pressure mercu ry lamp mounted axially. The results revealed that, both TiO 2 and ZnO were  effective though the latter was much 
superior in activity. Very recently [9], photocatalytic degradation of formaldehyde in indoor air was studied using nanoparti culate 
TiO 2 photoc atalyst. The degradation rate was found to be affected with initial concentration, light intensiy, stream flow rate and 
reaction temperature.  
In the light of the above discussion, the work in this paper was undertaken to study the photocatalysis of Reacti ve black -5 dye 
using TiO 2  as catalyst  in a indigenously designed UV irradiated annular reactor. Effects of influencing parameters such as flow 
rate, reactor operating time, solution pH  etc. on degradation of azo dye were investigated in detail. The model  proposed by 
Langmuir -Hinshelwood was employed to describe the kinetics of the photodecomposition reaction and the rate constant was 
evaluated under specified operating conditions.  Removal of Reactive Black 5 Dye from Aq ueous Solution using Photo Catalysis

The heterogeneous photocatalysis permits total degradation (mineral ization) of the most toxic organic molecules in aqueous 
solution in the presence of a catalyst. In this process, excitation of TiO 2 by a UV light of  wavelength λ≤ 380 nm generates electron -
hole pairs (e-cb, hᵥb+). Dissolved oxygen of the solution scavenges the electron generated, preventing the recombination of electrons 
and holes. Conduction band electrons and valence band holes generated from UV irradiated TiO 2 interact with TiO 2 surface 
adsorbed molecular oxygen and water to generate superoxide radical O 2·, and the highly reactive HO · respectively.  The hydroxyl 
radicals generated in this process are powerful oxidant due to high reactivity  [10]. This species is unstable and is continuously 
produced due to photochemical reactions. The mechanism [11 ] of the photocatalysis is shown below stepwise . 
 
The photodegradation efficiency or conversion was calculated by the following relation  
X (%) = 100 x (C0 -C)/C0      (5) 
Where X is the  photodegradation efficiency or conversion.  
III. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE  
 Mate rials and methods  
Reactive black dye ( C26H21N5Na4O19S6) procured from Sigma Aldrich was chosen as a simple model of reactive dye, largely used 
in textile industries. It is a heterocyclic aromatic compound whose structure is given in Fig.1. When dissolved i n water, the UV -
Visible spectrum gives maximum absorbance at 599nm (λ max).The natural pH of  aqueous dye  solution is 6.4.The pH of the 
solution was adjusted using NaOH or H 2SO 4. The aqueous solutions were prepared with deionised water.  
 
Fig. 1:  
The catalyst  TiO 2 (more than 99.9% purity)  procured from Sigma, Aldrich was used without any pre -treatment. From XRD analysis 
(Fig.2), it was found that TiO 2 contained only anatase form. The anatase form of TiO 2 has low band -gap energy (approximately 
3.2eV), w hich is almost equivalent to 400nm wavelength of light.

spectrophotometer  (Thermo: Genesys) . The absorbance vs . concentration data was plot ted in fig.3 . The curve was used extensively 
to determine Reactive Black -5 concentration during experime ntal runs.

The photoreactor of capacity 1720 ml contained 305 mm long, four no. UV lamps each with flux  13.5 W/m2. The sources of 
irradiation were placed uniformly inside the reactor to assure the  maximum energy exchange between the source of irradiation and 
reaction mixture that would flow out continuously. A pump was used to circulate the mixture between the reactor and the reser voir 
containing the feed solution. The schematic diagram of the expe rimental setup is furnished in Fig 4 .

VI. METHODS  
5 litres of the Reactive Black -5 solution of 50 mg/L was prepared by accurately weighing Reactive Black -5 dye in an electronic 
weighing balance (supplied by Sartorius, India Ltd.) and dissolving in de ionised water. Specified amount of TiO 2 (0.5 g/L) was 
accurately weighed and was mixed thoroughly with the dye solution . The solution was then  placed in the feed reservoir. The 
suspension was stirred for about half an hour in the absence of  UV light in order to reach adsorption equilibrium before irradiation 
with UV light. Photocatalysis reaction was carried out for a period of 2 hrs. The same procedure  was followed in each of two  flow 
rates of 10 and 15 Litre  per hour (LPH) respectively and for differ ent solution pH. The solution coming out of the reactor was 
directed to the reservoir and was allowed to mix thoroughly with the solution. The sample of reaction suspension (5ml) was 
withdrawn with a syringe from the reservoir at regular interval of 30 min utes. Each sample collected was then filtered and then 
analyzed in the UV -Visible spectrophotometer by measuring the absorbance at 599 nm. Using the calibration curve, the remaining 
Reactive Black -5 concentration of the samples was determined. Dye concentr ation was measured at different time interval (30,60, 
90 and 120 mins.) and the kinetics of the photocatalysis reaction was determined.  
VII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
 Effect of  flowrate  
Adsorption and photodegradation of Reactive Black -5(RB -5)  was carried out wi th varying flowrates 10 and 15 LPH. The 
concentration of RB -5 was plotted against time by measuring the residual RB -5 concentration in solution. The conversion of RB -
5 into harmless products was calculated using Equation no. (5). Fig. 5 depicts the change in concentration of RB -5 against time for 
a reactor operating time up to 120 minutes or 2 hrs at a flowrate of 10 LPH. From the experimental results it was observed that  
higher conversion (95.4%) had been achieved at a flowrate of 15 LPH compared to that (88.5%) at 10 LPH. The increase in percent 
degradation of RB -5 at higher flowrate could be due to the formation of turbulence in the solid liquid reaction medium. With the 
formation of turbulence at higher flowrate, the external mass transfer resis tance from the bulk solution to the catalyst surface had 
been reduced.  This might have indirectly increased the global rate of reaction between the catalyst and RB -5 resulting in increase 
in degradation efficiency.

 Effect of pH  
The effect of pH on the photo catalytic degradation efficiency of Reactive Black -5 by UV/TiO 2 process is one of the major factors 
affecting the rate of mineralization of various organic compounds. The degradation of Reactive Black -5 was c arried out under UV 
irradiation at different pH (4.2,  6.4, 8.4). It is evident that there is an optimum pH that would result in maximum Reactive Black -
5 conversion which was obtained in mildly acidic to neutral region. The process of the photocatalytic deg radation would involve 
radical oxidation, direct electron transfer and surface sorption reaction.  At mildly acidic condition (pH=6.4) the TiO 2 surface carries 
a net positive charge, while the RB -5 and the intermediates are basically negatively charged. Thi s results in better adsorption and 
subsequent better degradation of RB -5. However at stronger acidic condition (pH=4.2) RB -5 degradation rate (i.e. conversion) got 
retarded, probably due to the presence of excess hydrogen ion in the system. At alkaline med ium (pH=8.4), formation of OH 
radical, the main agent causing photocatalytic oxidation got retarded; Moreover in the vicinity of this pH, RB -5 became ionized 
(negatively charged) and got repelled from the negatively charged surface of the adsorbent, TiO 2. Due to these causes, at higher 
pH, the  
adsorption of  RB -5 on TiO 2 active sites decreased and hence  the RB -5 degradation rate  got lowered .

 Kinetic studies  
The Langmuir -Hinshelwood kinetic model was used to describe the mineralization process kinetics.  The Langmuir -Hinshelwood 
(L-H) model was initially developed to quantitatively describe gaseous –solid reactions. This model was recently employed to 
describe solid –liquid reactions.  In this model, the rate of reaction (r) is proportional to the fraction of surface covered by the 
subst rate (θ), as shown below:  
r = −dC/ dt = krθ                        (8) 
Considering Langmuir’s equation  
θ = KC/(1 + KC)                     (9) 
Combining Eq. (8) and (9),                                                                                 
r = krKC/(1+ KC)                                       (10) 
In Eq. (10) k r is the true rate constant, K is the Langmuir constant and C is the concentration of the organic substrate at any time t. 
Since in this case, the solution is highly diluted, C (mol/L) <10-3 [12] the term KC b ecomes <<1, and the reaction transforms to an 
apparent first order reaction, whose kinetic expression ma y be written as follows :  
r = −dC/ dt = krKC = kappC          (11) 
where k app is the apparent rate constant of a pseudo first order reaction.

VIII.  CONCLUSION  
From present investigation, it had been found that photocatalysis in UV/TiO2/O2  system was quite effective in degradation of  
Reactive Black -5. Effect of solution pH and flow rate  were found to influe nce the extent  of mineralization substantially. Slightly 
acid to neutral region solution pH was found to be favourable for the photocatalysis reaction. Due to higher turbulence, the 
degradation was found to get  enhanced considerably. The photodegradation  of RB -5 dye using TiO2 as a catalyst has been found 
to follow Langmuir -Hinshelwood model.
