Abstract :  
 
Highly mutagenic compounds such as some PAHs have been identified in surface waters and 
sediments of the Seine river estuary. Suspended particulate matter (SPM) represents a dynamic 
medium that may contribute to the exposure of aquatic organisms to toxic compounds in the water 
column of the estuary. In order to investigate major sources of mutagenic contaminants along the 
estuary, water samples were taken at 25 m downstream of the outlet of an industrial wastewater-
treatment plant (WWTP). SPM samples were analyzed for their genotoxicity with two short-term tests, 
the Salmonella typhimurium  mutagenicity assay (TA98 + S9 mix) and the comet assay in the human 
HepG2 cell line. Sampling sites receiving effluents from a chemical dye industry and WWTP showed 
the highest mutagenic potencies, followed by petrochemical industries, petroleum refinery and pulp 
and paper mills. These data indicate that frame-shift mutagens are present in the Seine river estuary. 
Furthermore, the comet assay revealed the presence of compounds that were genotoxic for human 
hepatocytes (HepG2 cells). We also observed a high level of mutagenic potency in the sediment of the 
lower estuary (3 × 104 revertants/g). The source of mutagenic and genotoxic compounds seems to be 
associated with various types of effluents discharged in the Seine river estuary. Both test systems 
resulted in the same assessment of the genotoxicity of particulate matter, except for three of the 14 
samples, underlying the complementarity of bioassays.

  31. Introduction 
 
 Water pollution by chemicals, as a result of massive industrialization and increasing 
urbanization, is a factor which threatens the preservation of aquatic ecosystems and also 
human health. River waters in Europe, Asia, South and North America show a strong 
contamination with chemical mutagens [1,2]. These rivers are reported to be contaminated 
with partially treated wastewaters from urban, agricultural and industrial sources. In France, 
the available data on genotoxicity of river waters in estuaries and urban areas are limited, 
with the exception of hospital effluents [3] and aquatic sediments from the Seine estuary 
[4,5]. The Seine river basin is the most urbanized and industrialized river basin in France. In 
addition, the Seine river estuary drains an area contaminated by urban and industrial 
activities located close to the cities of Rouen and Le Havre. Industrial activities are mostly 
petroleum refineries, paper industries and petrochemical industries. A large variety of 
pollutants, such as Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), Polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) 
and heavy metals, were quantified in the Seine river estuary [5,6]. The genotoxicity of the 
Seine river estuary sediment has been previously reported, underlying the mutagenic hazard 
for aquatic organisms [5].  
 Hydrophobic toxic compounds, including many genotoxic agents, are mostly 
adsorbed to suspended particulate matter (SPM) which are highly concentrated in industrial 
effluents [7,8]. After sedimentation, SPM are then accumulated in the sediment and 
contribute to its genotoxicity. Compared to sediment, the suspended particulate matter 
contains both short-living and persistent pollutants; this dynamic media may contribute to the 
exposure of aquatic organisms to toxic compounds in the water column. Despite the 
presence of high K ow substances and high concentrations of suspended particulate matter in 
effluents, few researchers have investigated the genotoxicity of substances adsorbed to 
effluent particulate matter [8-11] . Therefore, the measurement of SPM genotoxicity is ve ry 
helpful in understanding the source of water genotoxicity.  4A large number of different assays have been recommended to assess the presence of 
genotoxic contaminants in wastewater and industrial effluents [1]. Much of published surface 
water mutagenicity studies employed the Salmonella  mutagenicity test with strains TA 98 
and/or TA100, with and without metabolic activation [1]. The different responses of the 
Salmonella  strains can provide information on the classes of mutagens present in the water.  
Using mutagenic potency values, Houk categorized effluents, collected just prior to discharge 
in the waterways, from low to high genotoxicity according to the industrial sources [12-14].  
The most commonly used assay to measure DNA lesions (strand breaks, alkali labile 
sites and cross-links) is the comet assay. The comet assay, also known as the single-cell gel 
electrophoresis (SCGE) assay, was originally introduced by Ostling and Johanson [15] to 
measure DNA strand breaks in mammalian cells induced by radiation. This assay, which has 
been shown to be a rapid and reliable procedure for the quantification of DNA lesions, is now 
performed with various cell lines (CHO, V79, HepG2) for the detection of chemical 
genotoxicity [16] such as those caused by extracts of chlorinated drinking water on HepG2 
cell line DNA [17]. The HepG2 cells have retained the activities of phase I and phase II 
enzymes that play a key role in the activation and detoxification of DNA reactive carcinogens. 
Therefore, genotoxicity assays on eukaryotic cells, such as the Hep G2 cells, are 
complementary to in vitro tests with bacteria and also more relevant to human risk 
assessment.  
 The aim of the present study was to identify major sources of the 
genotoxic/mutagenic contamination observed in the Seine river estuary. While most studies 
have measured genotoxicity of effluents just prior to discharge into the river, we wanted here 
to integrate the dispersion of SPM in the river. Therefore, water samples were collected in 
the waterways about 25 meters downstream of industrial or municipal effluents. SPM 
genotoxicity has been analyzed with two short-term tests to compare their sensitivity, the 
Salmonella  mutagenicity assay (TA98 strain with S9 mix) and the comet assay on HepG2 
cell line. To our knowledge, genotoxicity assessment of estuarine waters has not been  5performed in France before this study. These data will also serve as a reference for ongoing 
studies on water genotoxicity assessment in the Seine river basin.  
 
  62. Materials & Methods 
 
2.1 Chemicals and media 
 
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), fetal calf serum and antibiotics (penicillin, 
streptomycin), phosphate-buffered saline without Ca2+ and Mg2+ (PBS) and Trypsin 
(0.05%)-EDTA (0.02%) solution were obtained from Gibco Laboratories (Cergy-Pontoise, 
France). Trypan-blue (0.5% w/v), Benzo[a]Pyrene (B[a]P) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) 
were purchased from Sigma (France). 
 
 
2.2 Study sites and water sample collection  
 
Water samples were collected in the Seine river estuary. The sampling sites are presented in 
Figure 1. They were chosen based on a previous study on PAHs distribution [6]. The river 
site located at the dam of Poses (E1) is considered as the reference site of the estuary. For 
effluents, the water was collected 25 m downstream the effluent outlet. The sediment sample 
was collected at Tancarville in the lower estuary. Samples of suspended particulate matter 
(SPM) were isolated by filtration of 40 liters of water through pre-combusted GF/F Whatman 
glass fiber filters (0.7 µm) as previously described [6]. Each filter was wrapped in aluminium 
foil and stored at – 18°C until analysis in the laboratory.  
Sediment (2 g) and filter containing the SPM was extracted three times by ultrasonication 
using dichloromethane/methanol (3:1 v/v) [6]. The extracts were reduced to 2 ml using a 
rotary evaporator, transferred to small vials, evaporated to near dryness with a gentle stream 
of nitrogen gas and then resuspended in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) for genotoxicity testing. 
The SPM and the sediment were analyzed for their mutagenic and genotoxic activity. 
 
  72.3 Salmonella mutagenicity assay – Ames test 
 
The Salmonella  mutagenicity assay was performed on filtered extracts, using the TA 98 
strain (his D3052, rfa, uvrB, pKM101) with S9 mix for detecting frameshift mutagens 
according to the direct plate incorporation method [18]. To assess the cytotoxicity of the 
samples to the bacteria, three dose-levels of each sample were tested in TA98 strain with S9 
mix. Samples, negative (DMSO, 200 µg/plate) and positive (2 Anthramine, 2 µg/plate) 
controls were pre-incubated with S9 mix (Molecular Toxicology, Inc., Annapolis. MD 21401, 
USA). Three plates were carried out per sample. Revertants were scored with an automatic 
counter (Artek Counter, OSI). The evaluation criteria was as follows: a two-fold increase in 
the number of revertants compared with the negative control (1% DMSO) was considered as 
mutagenic [18]. As we did not have enough samples to perform a dose response curve, we 
plot the negative control and the tested dose; then we have estimated the mutagenic potency 
as follows: y = a*x + b, where:  
y= number of revertants of the tested dose 
b= number of revertants in the negative control 
a= mutagenic potency of the tested dose (in liter equivalent or g of particulate material) 
x= volume (in liter) or weight (in gram) of the tested dose  
 
2.4 Cell culture and treatment 
 
HepG2 cells (ATCC HB 8065) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection 
(Biovalley, Conches, France). The cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% foetal 
calf serum and antibiotics (1% penicillin-streptomycin) and maintained at 37°C in a 
humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2. The cells were subcultured every 4 days and the 
medium was changed every 2 days. Routine monitoring showed the HepG2 cells to be 
mycoplasma-free (Mycoplasma detection kit, Biovalley, Marne-la-Vallée, France). The 
HepG2 cells were sampled at 100.000 cells/35 mm diameter Petri dish containing 2 ml of  8culture medium. 24h after seeding, cells were treated for 24h with various concentrations of 
SPM extracts or B[a]P dissolved in 1% DMSO. Cytotoxicity test using trypan blue was 
performed for each concentration of the tested compound. All experiments were performed in 
duplicate for each tested concentration. 
 
2.5 Comet assay  
 
The comet assay was performed according to Singh et al. [19] with minor modifications. After 
the treatment, 100 µl of cell suspension in 0.55% Low Melting Point agarose was spread 
onto microscope slides precoated with 0.5% normal melting point agarose. For each sample, 
two slides were prepared from the same aliquot. The cells were lysed for 1h at 15°C in the 
dark in a glacial lysis solution (2.5 M NaCl, 100 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 1% N-
sarcosinate, 10% DMSO, 1% triton x-100, pH 10). DNA unwinding was performed in fresh 
alkaline buffer (0.3 M NaOH, 1 mM EDTA, pH 13) for 35 min at 17°C in the dark. DNA 
migration was performed with the same buffer for 20 min at 23 V and 300 mA. After 
electrophoresis, the gels were neutralized by rinsing three times with buffer (Tris 0.4 M pH 
7.5). The DNA was stained with ethydium bromide (8 µg/ml) and the slides were then stored 
in a wet box for 24 h at 4°C in the dark.  
The slides were examined under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX60) (excitation 
filter 510-560 nm, barrier filter of 590 nm) using a 40X objective. Image analysis was 
performed using the Komet IV software (Kinetic Imaging, Liverpool, UK). Fifty individual 
nucleus/slides and two slides/concentration were analysed. The DNA damage was 
expressed as Olive Tail Moment (OTM, arbitrary units), calculated as follow: OTM=(Tail 
Mean – Head Mean)* Tail%DNA/100.  We have checked that the treatment of HepG2 cells 
with 1% DMSO was not genotoxic (data not shown). We observed that whatever the time of 
treatment (4h or 24h), SPM extracts induced a dose-dependent increase of OTM (data not 
shown). 
  92.6 Statistical analysis  
 
The Shapiro test was used to verify the normality of the variance of the comet data. The non-
parametric Wilcoxon test was performed to evaluate any significant differences between 
control and treated samples. Three levels were considered significant: p<0.05 (*), p<0.01 (**) 
and p<0.001 (***). All statistical analysis were performed with R software. 
  103. Results & Discussion  
 
 The present study has been carried out in order to investigate major sources of 
genotoxicity in the Seine river estuary with two short-term tests. We focused here on 
particulate matter extracts, since a substantial fraction of the genotoxicity is adsorbed to SPM 
[10]. In order to integrate the dispersion of the SPM into the river, we collected water 
samples 25 m downstream the outlet of the effluents. Spot sampling of water on industrial 
sites was more convenient than using particle "traps". The flow rate was 386 m3/s, which 
correspond to a low flow rate. The concentration of SPM that we measured ranged between 
3.6 mg/L and 109.7 mg/L with three samples, E3, E5 and E7, having a smaller 
concentrations (Table 1) .  
 
3
.1 Mutagenicity of SPM  
 
We observed that 11/14 samples (SPM and sediment) were mutagenic in the Ames test 
(TA98+S9 mix). Responses were from 2 to 21 times greater the negative control (Table 2). 
These results indicate the presence of frame-shift mutagens in the SPM extracts. Samples 
E4, E9 and E12 did not induce mutagenic effect under the testing conditions. As many 
published studies on this type of environmental samples are positive with the TA98 [1,20,21], 
we decided to chose the TA98 strain in priority. The choice of added S9 is justified by the 
presence of dissolved PAHs as noticed in many studies [5,6]. If we had had more materials, 
we would have tested the samples on TA100 and YG1041 with and without S9, however the 
YG1041 strain is more specific of nitroarenes and aromatic amine compounds, chemical 
compounds not yet identified in the Seine estuary. 
 
 In order to compare the mutagenicity of SPM extracts, we estimated the potency of 
each sample and expressed it in number of revertants per g of SPM (rev/g of SPM) (Table 
3). We noticed that SPM from the chemical dye industry effluent (E5) was the most  11mutagenic of all the tested effluents; E5 was half the mutagenic potency of the sediment at 
Tancarville, followed by the WWTP (E7) and the petrochemical industry (E3). SPM from La 
Bouille (E10), a river site impacted by various types of industries and by the municipal 
activities of Rouen city, had a mutagenic potency similar to SPM from petrochemical industry 
(E3. Despite of the dispersion of contaminants in the riv er La Bouille, its estimated mutagenic 
potency measured several kilometers downstream emission sites, was similar to the 
estimated mutagenic potency of a petrochemical effluent.  The two other river sites, Poses 
a
nd a site upstream Rouen city (E6), had lower potencies. We also noticed that samples with 
low SPM concentration (between 12 mg/L and 17.6 mg/L) were the most mutagenic ones 
(E5 and E7). Conversely, SPM from E9 and E12 were negative in both system tests in spite 
of their high SPM concentration. It seems that as the concentration of SPM increases, the 
genotoxic potency declines, suggesting that the sorption of genotoxic compounds depends 
upon the SPM concentration, as reported earlier [9]. In that study, White et al. have 
determined that the percent of organic genotoxins adsorbed to effluent SPM ranges between 
2.3% to 99.8%, depending on both the sorption partition coefficient and the concentration of 
available particulate matter.  
As expected, the sediment collected at Tancarville, the lower part of the estuary, presented 
the highest mutagenic potency (29.103 rev/g) (Table 3), suggesting the transfer and 
accumulation of mutagenic particulate matters coming from effluents located in the upper 
estuary. This value is similar to the one found in Santos estuary sediment (Brazil) with 31.103 
rev/g in TA98 +S9 [20] and higher than in Nagara River (Japan) [22] or another French site in 
the Provence region (Berre Lagoon) (248 rev/g in TA98 + S9) [4]. However, this value is 
lower than those obtained at severely contaminated sites, as for example in Hamilton 
harbour (Lake Ontarion, Canada) with 105 rev/g TA98 in the PAH-containing fraction [23,24].  
 We also estimated the potency of effluents and river water and expressed them in 
revertants per liter equivalent of original volume extracted (Fig.2). However, we considered 
only the particulate fraction of water as filtered water was not analyzed, so we can not 
directly compare our data with the classification of Houk [13].  Indeed Houk's classification  12was based on water effluents collected just prior to discharge into the environment while in 
our study, river water samples were collected downstream the effluent outlets. Moreover, 
Houk's classification included the mutagenicity of both particulate and dissolved phase, while 
only the particulate phase was considered in our study. However, we noticed that our 
samples presented low mutagenic potencies, ranging from 3.7 to 239 revertants/L (Fig.2). E5 
sample, a chemical dye industry, showed the highest mutagenic potency (239 revertants/L) 
which is about 5 times the WWTP (E7) (36 rev/L). It is interesting to note that E5 mutagenic 
potency is similar to mutagenic potency of Cristais water in Brazil, a river contaminated by 
dye industry effluents  [21]. 
 
 For various reasons, the mutagenic potency of SPM from the Seine river estuary 
might be higher than what we measured in this study: the mutagenicity of organic 
compounds extracted from either filtered water, SPM or sediment are sometimes much 
higher in absence of S9 mix [1,2,4]; we used the standard plate incorporation method, while 
the sensitivity of the Ames test has been increased by the micro-suspension techniques 
[25,26]; a much higher mutagenicity of the sediment and surface water is observed with the 
strain YG1041 than with the TA98 strain [4,27], indicating the presence of nitroarenes and 
aromatic amine, a class of potent mutagens which could be found in the Seine river SPM. 
Finally, the evaluation of mutagenicity was determined with punctual sampling. A more 
representative response could be obtained with passive sampling. For example, the 
dissolved PAHs can be sampled with the Blue rayon; in the same way, the particulate 
matters can be collected with sediment traps; both methods were used with success in rivers 
and estuaries [21,28,29]. 
 
3.2 Genotoxicity of SPM  
 
 The genotoxicity of SPM extracts was determined with the alkaline comet assay after 
a 24 hr treatment of HepG2 cells. Our data revealed that 12/14 samples (SPM and sediment  13extracts) elicited a significant increase of OTM compared with control cells, indicating that 
micro-pollutants adsorbed on SPM extracts are genotoxic for human hepatocytes; E9 and 
E13 SPM extracts were not genotoxic (Table 2).  
 The normalization of the OTM values per g of SPM allowed the comparison of 
genotoxic samples (Table 3): similar to the Salmonella  mutagenicity data, the sediment of 
Tancarville had the highest genotoxic potency, followed by E7, E5 and E6. The site of Poses, 
considered as the reference site of the estuary, and E12, had the lower genotoxic potency. 
The normalization of the OTM value per liter of water gave a quite similar ranking except that 
the sample from the river site upstream Rouen (E6) had the highest genotoxic potency 
(Fig.2), followed by samples from the WWTP (E7), pulp and paper mill industries (E2 and 
E4), chemical dye (E5) and petrochemical industries (E11). In spite of the dispersion of SPM 
in the river, the genotoxic potencies of these sites were higher than the OTM of the higher 
concentration of B[a]P tested in this study (data not shown). 
Similarly to the Ames test data, these results suggested that the genotoxic and mutagenic 
SPM from the upper estuary probably contribute to the genotoxic and mutagenic activities 
detected at Tancarville, 100 km lower in the river. Therefore, the sediment sampled at the 
mouth of the estuary constitutes a pool of genotoxic chemicals.  
 Compared to the Ames test, the comet assay provides a completely different aspect 
of the genotoxicity as the DNA strand breaks measured with this assay are reparable DNA 
lesions; some of them may lead to mutations. The comet assay is frequently used for the 
measurement of surface water or sediment genotoxicity on various cell lines for 
ecotoxicological purposes [4,30] or human risk assessment (e.g. safety assessment of 
drinking water, identification of the source of mutagenicity in river water [31,32]. The DNA-
damaging activity of SPM detected on HepG2 cell lines revealed the presence of pro-
genotoxic compounds adsorbed on SPM, as the HepG2 cells retains the capacity of 
metabolic activation. These results, as for the Ames test data, suggest the involvement of 
PAHs. Moreover, PAHs were detected on the SPM and sediment sampled in the Seine 
estuary [5,6]. Carcinogenic PAHs are genotoxic after being metabolized by Cytochrome  14P450 enzymes or by peroxidases. Some of their metabolites acquire electrophilic properties, 
allowing the formation of bulky DNA adducts due to covalent binding to DNA bases. DNA 
strand breaks might be due to the DNA repair of PAHs induced DNA adducts, as it has been 
shown previously on HepG2 cells treated either with various PAHs or with Benzo[a]pyrene 
solely [33-35]. Moreover, Cachot et al. [5] have shown that the PCB and PAH fractions of 
sediments were the more genotoxic using the SOS chromotest.  
 
 
3.3 Comparison of mutagenicity and genotoxicity 
 
Genotoxicity end-points measured with these two short-term tests are different: the Ames 
test with TA98 strain detected frame-shift mutagens and the alkaline comet assay revealed 
both genotoxicity (single and double strand break) and DNA repair of various DNA lesions 
such as bulky DNA adducts and DNA oxidation. Moreover, one test was performed on 
bacteria and the other one on human cells, suggesting a difference of sensitivity of these 
biological systems towards metabolized contaminants. These two short-term tests (Table 3 
and Fig. 2) revealed a similar tendency except for E4, E12 and E13. These tests are 
complementary as they show that some SPM samples (E4, E12, E13) are either genotoxic or 
mutagenic.  
We found that the sediment sampled at Tancarville is highly mutagenic and Cachot et al. 
found a moderate genotoxicity at Quilleboeuf-sur-Seine, a site located 10 km upstream 
Tancarville. These data underline that the evaluation of the genotoxic potency of sediments 
could be related to the bacterial short-term tests used, as previously reported with particulate 
river material with the umu-test and the Ames test [11] or with sediment [2].  
 
 
In conclusion, this preliminary study allowed the detection of genotoxic and mutagenic SPM, 
in spite of the dispersion of SPM in the river. Sampling sites receiving effluents from chemical  15dye industry and WWTP showed the highest mutagenic potencies. SPM from the upper 
estuary probably contributes to the genotoxic activity of the sediment.  The identification of 
mutagenic compounds should be investigated to discover chemicals responsible for the 
mutagenicity of the SPM.

Figure 1: Location of sampling sites. The Seine estuary extends over 153 Km with a freshwater part from the Dam of Poses to Caudebec and saltwater 
part from Caudebec to Honfleur. Effluents are located in the region of Rouen, except two sites (E12, E 13) located downstream of Vieux Port. Effluents 
were numbered: E2, E3, E4, E5, E7, E8, E9, E 11 and E 13; for these sites, water was collected 25 m downstream the outlet of effluent. Four sites 
correspond to river water: E1 located downstream the dam of Poses, E6 upstream of Rouen city, E 10 located at La Bouille, and E12 on the Commerce 
River. Sediment has been collected at Tancarville a site showing the highest level of chemical contamination in the estuary.
