This remote biosphere is decoupled from sunlight-derived organic carbon and rely exclusively on geogenic gases, such as methane or hydrogen (Lovley and Chapelle 1995). Opalinus Clay is a low-porosity clay rock, which is supposed to host nuclear repositories in Switzerland. In this regard and thanks to the underground rock laboratory of Mont-Terri in St-Ursanne, it has been extensively characterized (Bossart and Thury 2008). It is well established that pristine rock, because of its small pore size distribution, is not suitable for hosting microbial activity. But as soon as space is provided, because of the presence of organic matter (i.e., acetate) and electron donor (i.e., sulfate) in Opalinus Clay rock, microbial activity can take place (Stroes-Gascoyne et al. 2007). Thus, this project aimed at characterizing the biological response to H2, which will be produced by the anoxic corrosion of steel canisters, in repository-relevant conditions. An in-situ experiment was carried out where H2 was amended to borehole water for more than 500 days. H2 was rapidly consumed concomitantly with a production of hydrogen sulphide, an increase in planktonic cell density, and a decrease in CO2 concentration, suggesting that autotrophic sulfate reduction was the dominating process in this system. A metagenomic sequencing allowed the assembly of 15 high-quality genomes, together representing 75% of the microbial community. Metaproteomic analysis highlighted the presence of a complete carbon cycle. Two organisms oxidize hydrogen: a sulfate-reducing bacterium (Desulfobulbaceae) representing 42% of the community, and a Rhodospirillaceae reducing sulfite. Biomass produced by autotrophs is then oxidized to acetate by a Hyphomonas species. Fermentation products are finally oxidized to CO2 by several species of heterotrophic sulphate-reducing bacteria (Figure 1). This work provides the first insight into a complete carbon cycle in the deep subsurface and significantly expands our knowledge of microbial metabolisms in the deep biosphere. It also suggests that allowing microbial activity in nuclear waste repositories is beneficial, by buffering the pressure increase due to in-situ H2 production. 16th Swiss Geoscience Meeting, Bern 2018
