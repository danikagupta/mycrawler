Introduction  
Over 100,000 synthetic dyes are 
commercially available, with a total 
production of over 7× 105 tons per year (Fu 
and Viraraghavan, 2001). Among these, azo 
dyes are the most important group of 
synthetic colorants. They represent the 
largest class of dyes, and more than half of 
the annually produced synthetic dyes 
(estimated for 1994 worldwide as 1 million 
tons) are azo dyes (Stolz, 2001 ).           Many physico-chemical methods, including 
adsorption, precipitation, chemical 
oxidation, photodegradation, or membrane 
filtration have been used for color removal 
from wastewaters (Yeh and Thomas, 1995; 
Gogate and Pandit, 2004). However, these 
methods have high operating costs and 
limited applicability. Further, they produce 
large quantities of sludge, which again 
creates a problem in its disposal.  In recent ISSN: 2319 -7706 Volume 4 Number 3 (2015) pp. 866-891

Seven Egyptian fungal isolates were screened for decolorization of five acid 
textile dyes (red 399, black 194, blue 296, yellow 235 and yellow 218). Among 
the seven fungal isolates, only three showed the highest decolorization percent 
for acid red 399, acid blue 296 and acid black 194. Aspergillus flavus Link 
AUMC 9060 , Aspergillus tamarii Kita AUMC 9061 and Aspergillus parasiticus 
Speare AUMC 9062 were the most efficient for decolorization of acid black 194 
(85%, 91.15% and 85%, respectively). Optimum temperature, pH, incubation 
period and inoculums size for decolorization by A.flavus, A.tamarii and 
A.parasiticus was found to be 24 
C, pH 7, 8 days and 1 disc of inoculums 
(1cm in diameter), respectively. However, other investigated factors (inoculums 
age, dye concentration and sucrose concentration) were variable among the 
tested species. The structural integrity of untreated acid black 194 dye and 
treated with the selected species was studied by FT-IR analysis. FT-IR analysis 
showed there was no difference between treated and untreated acid black 194 
dye.  
Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2015) 4(3): 866-891   
867 
years, the research for biological 
decolorization method has been considered 
as effective, specific, less energy intensive 
and environmentally benign, since it results 
in partial or complete bioconversion of 
pollutants to stable non-toxic end products 
(Kuhad et al., 2004). Many fungi (especially 
white-rots), actinomycetes and bacteria are 
used for the development of biological 
processes for the treatment of textile 
effluents (Mielgo et al., 2001; Bhatt et al., 
2005).  
Moreover, textile effluents constitute one of 
the most problematic wastewaters to be 
treated not only for their high chemical and 
biological oxygen demands, suspended 
solids and toxic compounds but also for 
color. Thus, there is need to search other 
microorganisms for treating textile effluents, 
which are capable of growing at alkaline pH 
and having strong ligninolytic system. More 
recent researchers have demonstrated that 
decolorization studies carried out either the 
decolorization of various dyes by an 
individual fungal strain or the decolorization 
of a single dye by various fungal strains 
(Shahvali et al., 2000; Fu and Viraraghavan 
2001; Alhassani et al., 2007). With the 
exception of white rot fungi that can 
decolorize dyes, reports on decolorization by 
yeast or other filamentous fungi through 
enzymatic processes are very limited (Yang 
et al., 2003).  
Microbial decolorization can occur via two 
principal mechanisms: biosorption and 
enzymatic degradation, or a combination of 
both (Wu et al., 2012 and Phugare et al., 
2010). FT-IR analysis has been studied in 
order to understand the decolorization 
mechanism of acid black 194. Among the 
commercial dyes, C.I. Acid Black 194 is one 
of the most popular in leather, wool, 
polyamide and silk dyeing (Burkinshaw and 
Lagonika (2006) and Koh et al. (2001)). The present study has been focused on the 
isolation of fungal species that can 
decolorize industrial wastewaters which 
encompasses different types of acid dyes 
(red 399, black 194, blue 296, yellow 235 
and yellow 218) with high efficiency. 
Furthermore, conditions accelerating acid 
dye (C.I. Acid Black 194) decolorization 
were optimized  by three non -basidiomycetes 
fungal species. Statistical analysis of data 
was carried out by using one way analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) followed by 
homogenous subsets ( ) at 
confidence level of 5 % (0.05). Each 
experiment was conducted in triplicate and 
mean ±SE values were taken.  
Materials and Methods  
Dye stuff  
Five acid dyes were used in this study: 
Lanasyn Red M-G sgr, Lanasyn yellow F-
7GL sgr, Lanasyn yellow M-2GL p, 
Lanasyn Navy M-BL p and Lanasyn Black 
M-DL p 170. All dyes were kindly supplied 
by" Moket Mac" Company in industrial 
zone B1, 10 
of Ramadan City, El-
Sharqyiah, Governerate, Egypt.   
Isolation of fungi  
Water samples were collected from 
wastewater of an Egyptian company for 
artificial carpet at 10 
of Ramadan City, 
in sterile clean glass bottles then, stored at 
4°C. 
Wastewater samples were taken from the 
surface and at 50 cm depth from the surface. 
Fungi were isolated from water samples by 
using one ml of each sample, to which 9 ml 
of sterilized distilled water were added. The 
tubes content were mixed by shaking.  
Serial decimal dilutions Benson (2002) were 
made from the original concentration to 
reach dilutions up to 1/1000. The media Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2015) 4(3): 866-891   
868 
used for fungal isolation were Potato-
dextrose agar, s glucose agar, 
Czapek -Dox agar and Malt extract agar. 
Three replicates were prepared for each 
dilution and incubated at 28 C for 7 days.  
Fungal identification and maintenance  
Aspergillus sp1 , Aspergillus sp2 , Aspergillus 
sp3, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus sp4 and 
Aspergillus sp5; were isolated from surface. 
Aspergillus sp6 was isolated from water 
samples which collected at 50 cm depth. 
Identification was carried out according to 
the following references: John & Pitt 
(1979)and Gilman (1957)).  
The identification of the most potent isolates 
(Aspergillus sp1, Aspergillus sp2 and 
Aspergillus sp3) was confirmed by 
Mycological Center, Faculty of Science, 
Assiut University, Egypt, 71516 to be 
A.flavus Link, A.tamarii Kita and 
A.parasiticus Speare.  
The selected fungal species were maintained 
and sub-cultured on potato dextrose agar 
(PDA) s Yeast (autolysate) 
extract Agar media (CYA).   
Fungal cultures  
Pure cultures of the selected fungi were 
grown in petri-dishes for 7 days using 
s Yeast (autolysate) extract Agar 
media (CYA) Samson & Pitt (1985). This 
medium contains 30g/L sucrose, 1g/L 
KH2PO4, 0.5g/L KCL, 0.5g/L 
MgSO 4.7H2O, 3g/L NaNO3, 10 mg/L 
FeSO4,  5g/L Yeast extract, and 20g/L agar .  
Decolorization assay  
The experiments were carried out in 250 ml 
Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 
s medium to which the dye was added at concentarion 0.05g/L.  The pH was 
adjusted at 7±0.2 using phosphate buffer 
solution. The autoclaved flasks were left to 
cool then, separately inoculated with one 
disc (1cm in diameter) of each selected 
fungal spp. The flasks were then incubated 
for 7 days and at the end of this period, 10 
ml of the culture medium were centrifuged 
at 5000 rpm for 15 min (Hettich Zentrifugen 
Mikro22 R D-78532 Tuttlingen) then 
measured spectrophotometrically at  max for 
each acid dyes using T60 UV VIS 
spectrophotometer to calculate 
decolorization percent .

Result and Discussion  
Screening the decolorization of acid dyes 
using the selected fungal isolates, two 
types of media and two inoculums 
diameter  
The results in table 2 show that, Aspergillus 
sp1, Aspergillus sp2, Aspergillus sp3 were 
effectively able to remove more than 79% of 
three acid dyes out of the tested 5 acid dyes 
(red 399, blue 296 and black 194) 
s broth medium using one mycelial disc 
(1cm in diameter). Accordingly, they were Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2015) 4(3): 866-891   
869 
selected for further investigations. Elizabeth 
et al. (1999) found that, Pleurotus ostreatus 
(IE8) was able to decolorize 12 of 23 
industrial dyes, while Phanerochaete 
chrysosporium (ATCC 24725) decolorized 
only 5 dyes. They stated that, these 
industrial dyes were selected on the basis of 
their stability to a range of pH (pH 311), 
thermostability and stability under culture 
conditions in non -inoculated flasks.  
Determination of the highest 
decolorization rate among the tested acid 
dyes  
According to the results of the previous 
experiment, three dyes (a.red 399, a.blue 
296 and a.black 194) were chosen to 
investigate the decororization rate of the 
most efficient fungal spp. The results 
recorded in fig 2 show that, Aspergillus 
flavus Link, Aspergillus tamarii Kita and 
Aspergillus parasiticus Speare were able to 
decolorize acid black 194 by the following 
rates: 85%, 91.15% and 85.25%, 
respectively. Accordingly, Acid Black 194 
has been chosen for further studies using 
Aspergillus flavus Link, Aspergillus tamarii 
Kita and Aspergillus parasiticus Speare. 
Park et al. (2004) studied decolorization of 
three acid dyes by Trametes versicolor 
ATCC 200801, Trametes versicolor KCTC 
16781, and Phanerochaete chrysosporium 
KCCM 60256. They observed that, acid blue 
350 was the most rapidly decolorized, while 
the other acid dyes were difficult to be 
decolorized. In order to obtain better results, 
the systematic study on the relationship 
between dye structure and fungal 
decolorization is necessary; however, this 
kind of study until now has been rather 
scarce (Chagas and Durrant (2001) and 
Knapp et al., 1995).  
Effect of incubation temperature on 
decolorization of acid black 194 dye   The results in fig3 show that, the 
decolorization ability of A.flavus was less 
than 50% when incubated at 20C. The 
increase in incubation temperature resulted 
in a significant increase which reached to its 
maximum value (85.9%) at 28C. There was 
no a significant differences between 24C 
and 28C so, 24C was selected to be the 
incubation temperature for further studies 
with A.flavus. In the case of A.tamarii the 
level of decolorization showed no a 
significant difference under all tested 
temperatures, so 24C was chosen as the 
optimum for decolorization of acid black 
194 by A.tamarii , while in the case of 
A.parasiticus, increase in temperature 
resulted in a significant decrease in 
decolorization percent. It was found there 
was no a significant difference between 
20C and 24C, so 24C was chosen for 
decolorization of acid black 194 by 
A.parasiticus.  
Accordingly 24C has been chosen to carry 
out the following experiments as the 
incubation temperature for all tested species. 
Ponraj et al. (2011) found that, A.niger and 
Mucor sp were the most effective 
decolorizer at 27 and 37C, respectively , 
whereas at 4C A. niger was the most 
effective decolorizer. Tamer et al. (2008) 
reported that, the biosorption capacity of 
acid black 40 onto Thuja orientalis was 
favored at lower temperatures and they 
stated that, an increase in the temperature 
from 20 to 40C leaded to a decrease in the 
biosorption capacity. Radha et al. (2005) 
reported that, at higher 35C or lower 35 
C, the decolorization activity of the fungus 
reduced and they stated that, the fungus 
either unable to produce peroxidases for 
decolorization or peroxidases denatured.  
Effect of initial pH values on 
decolorization of acid black 194 dye  
The results recorded in fig 4 show that, the Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2015) 4(3): 866-891   
870 
decolorization percent of acid black 194 at 
pH 7 was 89%, 75.9% and 89.9%, 
respectively with A.flavus, A.tamarii and 
A.parasiticus .  
According to the results pH 7 was selected 
to be the optimum for decolorization of acid 
black 194 using the selected fungal species. 
These results could be due to an electrostatic 
attraction between the dye and the 
biosorbent during the biosorption process. If 
there was a negative charge on the dye and a 
positive charge on the biosorbent, they 
would attract each other. But at acidic pH, 
when there was a large amount of H, that 
the attraction could be disrupted because of 
an attraction between the Hand dye. A 
similar but opposite reaction could be 
occured at alkaline pH when there was a 
large amount of OH in the solution 
(Khalaf, 2008). 
Frida (2009) mentioned that, the highest 
decolorization rates were obtained between 
pH 4 and 10. In contrast to our results Yuyi 
et al. (2011) reported that, acidic conditions 
could be favorable for the biosorption 
between the two dyes (acid black 172 and 
congo red) and the fungal biomass, because 
a significant high electrostatic attraction 
could be existed between the positively 
charged surface of the adsorbent under 
acidic conditions and the anionic dyes (AB 
and CR are anionic dyes in solution for -SO3 
group in their structure). At pH 10.0, the 
biosorption values were 22.56 and 21.67 mg 
g_1 for AB and CR, which were 44% and 
48% of maximum values, respectively .  
Effect of inoculum size on decolorization 
of acid black 194 dye   
The results in fig 5 indicate that, the highest 
decolorization percent achieved using two 
discs of Aspergillus flavus Link (87.4%). In 
the case of Aspergillus tamarii Kita the 
highest decolorization percent achieved using ten discs (85%). There was no a 
significant difference between the use of one 
disc and the other used inocula for A.flavus 
and A.tamarii . While in the case of 
Aspergillus parasiticus Speare the highest 
decolorization percent took place using one 
disc (95.2%). The increase in inoculum size 
exhibited no a significant increase in the 
decolorization percent of A.flavus and 
A.tamarii , so the maximum decolorization 
percent has been achieved using one 
disc(1cm in diameter) but, in the case of 
Aspergillus parasiticus exhibited slight a 
significant decrease in the decolorization 
percent, so one disc(1cm in diameter) was 
the most effective. Kumar and Sumangala 
(2012) observed that, the ideal volume of 
inoculum was found to be 2% for 
Penicillium chrysogenum and 10% for 
Aspergillus niger. Radha et al. (2005) 
reported that, the maximum decolorization 
of synthetic dyes using Phanerochaete 
chrysosporium occurred at an inoculum size 
of 2 ml (approximately 3.2 x 105 cell/ml). 
Shahvali et al. (2000) reported that, an 
inoculum size of 10% was sufficient for the 
decolorization of the textile wastewater, 
above which there was no change in 
decolorization percent.  
Effect of inoculum age on decolorization 
of acid black 194 dye  
The results recorded in fig 6 show that, the 
optimum decolorization percent for A.flavus 
Link was 96.2% using 4 days old culture, 
while in the case of A.parasiticus Speare 
there was no a significant difference 
between 8 day old culture and 4 day 
old culture, so four days old culture (92.4%) 
was chosen to be used as the optimum 
inoculum age, but in the case of A.tamarii 
Kita the optimum decolorization percent 
was achieved using two days old culture 
(90.4%). Older inoculums age resulted in a 
significant decrease in the decolorization Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2015) 4(3): 866-891   
871 
percent especially in case of A.flavus and 
A.tamarii , but in case of A.parasiticus 
exhibited no a significant increase in the 
decolorization percent. Inoculums age vary 
from a fungal species to another and this 
might due to variation in molecular structure 
of fungal cell wall. Also, young inoculums 
age characterized with enormous activity 
and viability  
Effect of incubation period on 
decolorization of acid black 194 dye  
The results in fig7 show that, the 
decolorization percent has been increased by 
increasing the incubation period until 
reaching the optimum decoloriztion at the 
8 day of incubation. Longer incubation 
periods revealed no a significant difference 
between decolorization percents of 8, 
10 and 12 day. According to results, 
8 days of incubation were taken as the best 
incubation period for the maximum 
decolorization abilities of A. flavus Link, A. 
tamarii Kita and A. parasiticus Speare, with 
the following percents: 88.8%, 98.3% and 
97.4%, respectively. In contrast to our 
results, Belsare and Prasad (1988) studied 
effect of incubation period on color removal 
using Shizophyllum conmune and they 
observed that, 80% color reduction was 
achieved within one day incubation and 82% 
in two days, but no increase was observed, if 
the incubation period increased more than 
two days. So, they suggested that, two days 
of incubation were sufficient for the process 
of decolorization.  
Other studies, for example, Husseiny (2008) 
reported that, the maximum reduction% was 
recorded for Aspergillus niger, after 4 days 
of incubation period for both reactive red 
120 and direct red 81 dyes. Also, Assadi & 
Jahangiri (2001) and Mcmullan et al. (2001) 
reported that, the maximum color 
reduction% was achieve d by Penicillium spp after 4 days of incubation period at 
temperature 35C for both reactive red 120 
and direct red 81 dyes.  
Effect of acid black 194 initial 
concentration on dye decolorization   
The results in fig8 show that, the 
decolorization percent for Aspergillus flavus 
Link reached its maximum value (87.3%) at 
dye concentration 25 mg/L, while in the case 
of  Aspergillus tamarii  Kita and Aspergillus 
parasiticus Speare the maximum 
decolorization values (92.5% & 96.4% , 
respectively) were  observed by the addition 
of 50 mg/L  of the used dye. Then, increase 
in the dye concentration resulted in a 
significant decrease in the decolorization 
percent.   
In case of A.parasiticus Speare, the fungal 
cells kept their ability to decolorize the dye 
up to 62.6% even when dye applied at high 
concentration (150 mg/L). On the other 
hand, the decolorization percent of A.flavus 
Link and A.tamarii Kita decreased 
significantly (21.9% and 42.7%, 
respectively) when dye added at 
concentration (150 mg/L). The present 
results are in agreement with those of 
Youssef et al. (2008) who studied the 
decolorization of malachite green by 
Acremonium kiliense and observed that, 
95.4% of malachite green was decolorized, 
when the concentration of the dye was 5 mg 
L-1 but decolorization was only 35.48%, 
when the dye concentration was doubled. 
They have attributed this trend to the 
inhibition of fungal growth at high dye 
concentration.   
Also, Zhang et al. (1999) observed that, 
color removal efficiency decreased with an 
increased in the concentration of the cotton 
bleaching effluent. Mou et al. (1991) 
reported that, high dye concentration result Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2015) 4(3): 866-891   
872 
in low color removal. Young and Yu (1997) 
also reported that, high dye concentration 
decreased decolorization rates. Other studies 
carried out by Radha et al. (2005) showed 
that, decolorization of synthetic dyes using 
Phanerochaete chrysosporium reached up to 
90% for an initial dye concentration (0.02 
g/L). However, at higher concentrations, 
Phanerochaete chrysosporium proved to be 
more effective for decolorization of Congo 
red than acid red 114. Hu and Wu (2001) 
reported that, desorption of the dyes from 
the fungal cells especially at higher dye 
concentrations may be due to higher 
molecular mass and structural complexity of 
the dyes.  
Effect of sucrose concentration on 
decolorization of acid black 194 dye  
Results in fig 9 reveal that, 10 g/L was the 
best sucrose concentration for Aspergillus 
flavus Link with decolorization percent 
reached to 94.7%. In the case of Aspergillus 
tamarii Kita, the decolorization was 86.1% 
if sucrose added at 20 g/L. However, in the 
case of Aspergillus parasiticus Speare, 2.5 
g/L sucrose was enough to obtain 95.4% 
decolorization, also all tested sucrose 
concentrations revealed no a significant 
increase in the decolorization percent. So, 
2.5 g/L was the optimum sucrose 
concentration which used for Aspergillus 
parasiticus Speare.   
In case of A.tamarii the results revealed that 
sucrose concentration up to 10 g/L was not 
effective in decolorization level. However, 
the decolorization level significantly 
increased to 86.1% by the addition of 20 
g/L. The sucrose concentration vary from 
fungal species to another due to each fungal 
species has specific requirement of sucrose 
for its growth and decolorization ability. The 
effect of sucrose concentration on 
decolorization rate has been rarely reported. A general tendency observed is that, Mou et 
al. (1991) studied the effect of glucose 
concentration on decolorization of dyes by 
Myrothecium verrucaria and observed that, 
the glucose concentration did not influence 
on the bio-decolorization process. Also, 
observed that, rapid growth of the fungus in 
C-limited medium with dye indicated that, 
the fungus utilized the dye as the sole source 
of carbon and produced enzymes to degrade 
the dyes.  
FT-IR analysis: The bands in the case of 
A.flavus Link at 3396.03 cm-1 that referred 
to OH group, 2938.02 cm-1 that referred to 
CH group, 1639.2 cm-1  that referred to C=C 
group and 1240 cm-1 that referred to C-N 
group. These peaks presented in spectrum of 
control. In the case of A.tamarii Kita 
observed after treatment bands  appeared at 
3386.39 cm-1  referred to OH group, 2936.09 
cm-1   referred to CH group, 1638.23 
referred to C=C group and 1247.72 cm-1 
referred to C-N group all these groups 
presented in the spectrum of control. In the 
case of A.parasiticus Speare gave bands at 
3408.57 cm-1  referred to OH group, 2939.95 
cm-1  referred to CH group, 2119.39 cm-1 
referred to CC group, 1638.23 cm-1 
referred to C=C group, 1413.57 cm-1 
referred to CH group and 1251.58 cm-1  
referred to C-N group all peaks presented in 
control spectrum. The results showed that, 
there was no variation between peaks of 
treated and untreated dye (control).    
Husseiny (2008) found that, treatment of 
direct red 81 with Aspergillus niger gave an 
IR band at 3549.1 cm-1 referring to NH2 
group and band at 333.6 cm-1 referring to 
OH group. These peaks did not present in 
spectrum of original dye. This meant that, 
the dye degraded by Aspergillus niger , while 
treatment of that dye with Penicillium spp 
gave the same peaks of the original dye, this 
meant that dye might adsorb by penicillium Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2015) 4(3): 866-891
