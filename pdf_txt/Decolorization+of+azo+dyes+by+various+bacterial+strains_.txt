ABSTRACT 
Purple non-sulfur bacterial isolates from different water resources have shown decolorizing 
activity on different azo dyes. Five isolates of different purple nonsulfur bacterial species, i.e. 
Rhodobacter adriaticus, R. blasticus, R. capsulatus, Rhodovulum strictum, Rhodopseudomonas 
palustris) could decolorize up to 96% of tested dyes after two days of illuminated and anaerobic 
incubation. The decolorizing activity varied by the phototrophic isolates and by the dye substrates. 
Although phototrophic bacteria have been known to be able to metabolize N-heterocyclic 
compounds, this is the first report on the metabolizing activity of these bacteria on azo dyes.

INTRODUCTION 
Azo dyes are widely used in industrial, printing as well as textile dyeing process because of their 
diversity of chemical structure, ease of synthesis and chemical stability. Recently, azo dyes became 
of concern in wastewater treatments because 10-15% of the dyes used in dyeing processing are 
discharged in effluent (Vaidya, 1982), particularly because of their bio-recalcitrance and potential 
toxicity to animals and humans (Levine, 1991; Chung, 1992). Thus the wastewater with azo dyes 
must be decolorized and furthermore mineralized in appropriate systems. Biological treatment of 
azo dyes-polluted wastewater has the advantage of cost effectiveness. Although, aerobic 
decolorization of azo dyes by white rot fungi has been reported (Ollikka et aI., 1993; Swamyand 
Ramsay 1999a, 1999b), azo dyes have rarely been decolorized by bacteria under aerobic 
conditions (Zimmermann et aI., 1982; Idaka et aI., 1978, 1987). The anaerobic treatment of textile 
wastewater can decolorize a variety of dyes (Brown and Laboureur, 1983). Treatment schemes for 
colored wastewater based on the anaerobic bacterial reduction of the azo bond are being used by 
the textile industry, as well as being studied by many groups (Walker, 1970; Whurmann et aI. 1980; 
Chung and Stevens, 1993). Microbial reductive decolorization has been suggested to involve an 
azo reductase (Zimmermann et aI., 1982; Chung and Stevens, 1993), an intracellular reduction by 
reduced flavin nucleotides (FADH2) (Whurmann et aI. 1980) or secreted extracellular redox 
mediators (H2S) (Yoo E.S., 2000). Various obligate and facultative anaerobes have been reported 
to be able to decolorize azo dyes. However, the ability has not shown yet for the diverse group of 
phototrophic bacteria. Phototrophic bacteria are Gram-negative cells predominating in most of 
natural habitats and having a very broad phenotypic range. Purple non-sui fur bacteria have been 
known for their diverse energy metabolisms such as chemolithotroph, chemoheterotroph, S-, Fe­
oxidizers, S-reducers, etc. They can also carry out anoxygenic photosynthesis with H2S or H2 as 
electron donor for NADPH synthesis in C02 fixation (Madigan M. T. et aI., 2002). These bacteria 
have been shown to degrade varied heterocyclic xenobiotics (Blasco R. and Castillo F., 1992; 
Harwood C.S. and Gibson J., 1988; Kamal V.S. and Wyndham R.C., 1990; Khanna P. Rajkumar 
B.S. and Jothikumar N., 1992; Montgomery L. and Vogel T.M., 1992). Recently, we have isolated 
and identified of purple non-sulfur bacterial isolates from different water-bodies in Vietnam and 
many of theses isolates showed high capacity of metabolizing N-heterocyclic xenobiotics (Ai et aI., 
2002). We have also found that some of these isolates could also decolorize azo dyes. 
Experimental results to demonstrate their decolorizing activity were reported in this 
communication. 
-1l2-MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Microorganism and media 
Purple non-sulfur bacteria used in this study had been isolated and identified by Ai et aI., 2002. 
Strains were maintained on 2% agar SA (lg/l sodium succinate, 0.5g/l KH2P04, 0.6g/1 K2HP04, 
19/1 (N:H4)zS04, 0.2g/l MgS04.7H20, 0.2g/l NaCl, 0.05g/l CaCh.2 H20, O.lg/l Na2S203.5H20, 
O.lg/l yeast extract, Iml/l vitamin solution, Iml/l mineral solution, pH 6.8 -7.0) or, alternatively 
for salt-tolerant strains, on 2% agar SSW (lg/l sodium succinate, 0.2g/l KHzP04, 0.9g/1 K2HP04, 
19/1 (N:H4)2S04, 0.2g/1 MgS04. 7H20, 20g/l NaCl, 0.05g/1 CaCh.2 H20, O.lg/l Na2S203.5H20, 
2g/l MgCh, O.lg/l yeast extract, Imlll vitamin solution, Imlll mineral solution, pH 6.8 -7.0) 
media; vitamin solution (0.5g/1 thiamin hydrochloride, O.5g/1 niacin, 0.3g/1 p-aminobenzoic acid, 
O.lg/l pyridoxal hydrochloride, 0.05g/1 biotin, 0.05g/1 Bl2), mineral solution (1g/1 EDTA-2Na, 2g/l 
FeCh, O.lg/l ZnCh, 0.1g/1 MnCh, O.lg/l H3B03, O.Ig/l CoCh.6H20, 0.02g/l Na2M04. 2H20, 
O.Olg/l CuCh.2H20, 0.01g/1 NiCh.6H 20, 0.005g/l Na2Se03) (Hoshino, 1984; Kawasaki, 1993). 
Azo dyes 
The azo dyes used in this study (Table 1) include Orange II, Orange 16 and some commercially 
significant dyes in Vietnam. 
Solid-plate decolorization studies 
Solid SA or SSW medium containing azo dye was prepared by adding agar powder and a dye 
solution to a final concentration of2% and lOppm, respectively. Each plates containing one of the 
dyes and a control plate with no dye added were inoculated with one purple non-sui fur strain and 
incubated under anaerobic and illuminated (20001ux provided by a lamp) condition at 30°C for 7 
days. Decolorization was assessed by appearance of halo clear zone surrounding the bacterial 
colonies on the plates. Uninoculated plates served as controls for abiotic decolorization. 
Aqueous batch decolorization studies 
Each strain of Rhodobacter blasticus PN5, R capsulatus PN16, and Rhodopseudomonas palustris 
PN15 was inoculated into different 250ml-Erlenmeyer flasks containing lOOml SA medium. 
Alternatively, each strain of Rhodobacter adriaticus PN21, and Rhodovulum strictum PN31, was 
inoculated into different 250ml-Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100ml SSW medium. Each flask 
was added an aliquot of dye solution to a final concentration of 50ppm, and incubated under 
illuminated anaerobic condition at 30°C for 3 days to be used as seeding cultures. 
Ten ml of each seeding culture was correspondingly transferred into flask containing 90ml of the 
same medium with corresponding dye as the seeding culture. The seeded flasks were incubated in 
the same condition as for seed cultivation. After 24 and 48 hours of incubation, sample was taken. 
Bacterial cells were eliminated by centrifuged at 1O.000rpm for 5 min and the supernatant was 
used for spectrophotometric measurement. Residual concentration of a certain tested dye was 
determined basing on the corresponding calibration curve of the absorbance at maximal 
wavelength of the dye versus a range of 1 -5ppm of the dye. Relative decolorizing activity was 
expressed as the residual percentage of the dye after incubation taking the initial concentration of 
dye in the medium as 100. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Screening of potential purple non-sulfur bacterial isolates being capable of decolorizing azo dye 
Azo dye-decolorizing activity was screened on our collection of 17 strains belonging to 8 species 
of identified purple non-sulfur phototrophic bacteria, which have been isolated from different 
water bodies in Vietnam. This initial evaluation of dye decolorizing was done using solid

medium with the two analytical grade azo dyes Orange IT and Orange 16. After 7 days of 
illuminated anaerobic incubation, decolorization activity was evaluated basing on the diameter of 
clear zone around the colonies (Table 2). Among the screened phototrophic bacterial strains, only 
the 5 strains of Rhodobacter blasticus PN5, Rhodobacter adriaticus PN21, Rhodobacter 
capsulatus PN16, Rhodovulum strictum PN31 and Rhodopseudomonas palustris PN15 showed 
strong decolorizing activity on both Orange IT and Orang 16. These strains were selected and their 
-114-dye decolorizing activity was quantified by aqueous batch culture in later experiments. Other 
strains showed no activity or very weak activity on these two dyes. 
Decolorization of azo dyes by purple non-sulfur bacterial strains in liquid culture 
Rhodobacter blasticus PN5 could decolorize 40 and 44% of Orange IT after 24 and 48h incubation, 
respectively (Table 3). Decolorizing activity on Orange 16 was limited to 16% after 48h incubation. 
As for Reactive Black 5, the activity was limited 20% after 24h but could be extended to 40% after 
48h. This strain showed almost no activity on the tested Remazol dyes

after 24h but could decolorizing 12% of Remazol Red 3BS after 48h. Rhodobacter capsulatus 
PN16 could decolorize a wide range of dyes. After 24h of incubation, the strain could decolorize 
30-32% of Orange n, Orange 16 and Reactive Black 5, while showing no activity on Remazol 
groups. When the incubation was extended to 48h, except for Remazol Yellow 3RS, which could 
not be decolorized at all, other tested dyes were decolorized from 18-94%. Rhodopseudomonas 
palustris PN15 could not decolorize Orange n and Reactive Black 5 within 48h. On the other hand, 
the strain showed high activity on Remazol group, especially on Orange 16, 70% and 96% of the 
dye was decolorized after 24h and 48h, respectively. Red 3BS and Blue Gl33 were decolorized up 
to 76% after 48h, while Yellow 3RS was limited at 10%. Among the two salt-tolerant strains 
-116-(Rhodobacter adriaticus PN21 and Rhodovulum strictum PN31), R. adriaticus PN21 strain 
showed decolorizing activity on all the tested dyes. The activity was at 44 and 70% of Remazol 
Red 3BS and Orange 16, respectively, and 16 -26% of the other dyes after 48h incubation. 
Rhodovulum strictum PN31 had more substrate selectivity. After 24h incubation, the strain could 
decolorize only Remazol Red 3BS but with fairly high 58% relative activity. After 48h, it could 
also decolorize Red 3BS and Orange 16 at 58% and 80%, respectively. The strain could not 
decolorize Orange II, reactive Black 5, Remazol Blue G133 and Yellow 3RS after 48h incubation. 
Thus, studied purple non-sulfur strains exhibited different decolorizing capacity on different azo 
dyes. R. capsulatans PN16 could decolorize 32-94% of 5 among the 6 tested dyes. R. adiaticus 
PN21 showed activity on all 6 studied dyes with relative activity varied from 16 up to 70%. R. 
palustris PN15 and R. blasticus PN5 showed 8-96% relative activity on 4 of the 6 tested dyes. R. 
strictum PN31 could showed 20-80% relative activity on 2 among the tested dyes. On the other 
hand, Orange 16 and Red 3BS were widely sensitive to all 5 purple non-sulfur strains. Remazol 
Blue G133 was decolorized by 3 among 5 studied strains, and Orange II, Reactive Black 5 were 
sensitive to 3 oftested bacterial strains within 2 days. Remazol Yellow 3RS was most recalcitrant 
and could be decolorized slightly by only 2 among studied bacterial strains. 
CONCLUSIONS 
Purple non-sulfur bacteria have been known for their diverse energy metabolisms and various 
application properties. These bacteria have interesting properties such as protein rich cell mass to 
produce single cell protein, H2-producing capacity for renewable energy strategy, high content of 
biological active substances such as vitamins, ubiquinon, good capacity of degradation of 
xenobiotics, especially heterocyclic comounds. However, the ability of decolorizing and 
metabolizing azo dyes was not reported for purple phototrophic bacteria in general and purple 
non-sulfur phototrophic bacteria, in particularly. We have recently isolated and identified of purple 
non-sulfur bacterial isolates from different water-bodies in Vietnam. Many isolates showed high 
capacity of metabolize N-heterocyclic xenobiotics (Ai et al., 2002). In this report, we successfully 
demonstrated that some of these isolates could also decolorize different azo dyes, including 
commercially significant monoazo and disazo dyes used in Vietnam. This is the first report on 
decolorization of azo dyes by phototrophic bacteria. Our experimental results showed that the 
decolorizing activity varied by the phototrophic isolates and by the dye substrates. A mixture of 
strains rather a pure strain, therefore, would be the choice for dye-containing wastewater treatment 
purpose. On the other hand, none of studied strains could decolorize a 100% of the dyes after 48h 
incubation. Further studies on the optimizing of treatment condition in order to improve 
decolorizing activity are needed.
