The “club drug” 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; also known as ecstasy) binds preferentially to and reverses the activity
of the serotonin transporter, causing release of serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] stores from nerve terminals. Subsequent acti-vation of postsynaptic 5-HT receptors by released 5-HT has been shown to be critical for the unique psychostimulatory effects of MDMA.In contrast, the effects of direct activation of presynaptic and/or postsynaptic receptors by MDMA have received far less attention, despitethe agonist actions of the drug itself at 5-HT
2receptors, in particular the 5-HT2Breceptor. Here we show that acute pharmacological
inhibition or genetic ablation of the 5-HT2Breceptor in mice completely abolishes MDMA-induced hyperlocomotion and 5-HT release in
nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area. Furthermore, the 5-HT2Breceptor dependence of MDMA-stimulated release of endoge -
nous 5-HT from superfused midbrain synaptosomes suggests that 5-HT2Breceptors act, unlike any other 5-HT receptor, presynaptically
to affect MDMA-stimulated 5-HT release. Thus, our findings reveal a novel regulatory component in the actions of MDMA and represent
the first demonstration that 5-HT2Breceptors play an important role in the brain, i.e., modulation of 5-HT release. As such, 5-HT2B
receptor antagonists may serve as promising therapeutic drugs for MDMA abuse.

Introduction
Despite a widespread distribution in the CNS (Choi and Maro-
teaux, 1996; Schmuck et al., 1996; Duxon et al., 1997; Bonaven-ture et al., 2002), 5-HT
2Breceptor function in the brain is mainly
unknown. Few studies have attributed a direct effect of the
5-HT2Breceptor in the CNS. For example, /H9251-methyl-5-(2-
thienylmethoxy)-1 H-indole-3-ethanamine (BW723C86), a
preferential 5-HT2Bagonist, was shown to increase food con -
sumption, reduce grooming, and after microinjection in the me-dial amygdala to elicit anxiolysis in the social interaction model(Kennett et al., 1998). Evidence indicates that 5-HT
2Breceptors
are also involved in non-rapid eye movement sleep regulation
(Popa et al., 2005) and neonatal respiratory rhythms (Gunther etal., 2006). Moreover, a recent study showed that 5-HT
2Brecep -
tors govern the overall 5-HT transport system by promotingphosphorylation of serotonin transporter (SERT) in primaryneurons from raphe nuclei (Launay et al., 2006).However, no empirical evidence exists in support of a role
for either central or peripheral 5-HT
2Breceptors in
psychostimulant-evoked hyperactivity. Several reasons could
explain this lack of investigation. Only modest levels of5-HT
2Breceptors were commonly detected in brain, and most
available pharmacological agents do not discriminate 5-HT2B
and 5-HT2Creceptors. It remains possible that some of the
psychostimulant effects attributed to the 5-HT2Creceptor are
5-HT2Breceptor dependent (McCreary and Cunningham,
1999).
The mechanism of action of the amphetamine derivative 3,4-
methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; also known as ec-stasy) is based on its ability to reverse monoamine reuptake trans-porters, resulting in monoamine release from nerve terminals,especially 5-HT and dopamine (DA) (Rudnick and Wall, 1992).MDMA is thus classically considered to act as an indirect agonistof several 5-HT and DA receptor subtypes. MDMA binds toSERT with high affinity and inhibits 5-HT uptake more potentlythan DA uptake (Crespi et al., 1997). Thus, a unique contributionof 5-HT has been proposed to underlie the behavioral responsesto MDMA. Indeed, 5-HT reuptake inhibitors such as fluoxetine,as well as genetic ablation of SERT, prevent the effects of MDMAin mice (Bengel et al., 1998; Trigo et al., 2007). However,MDMA and its N-demethylated metabolite 3,4-methylene-
dioxyamphetamine (MDA) each preferentially bind to and acti-vate human recombinant 5-HT
2Breceptors at concentrationsReceived Nov. 12, 2007; revised Jan. 21, 2008; accepted Jan. 21, 2008.

MDMA and MDA elicit also a prolonged mitogenic responses inhuman valvular interstitial cells, via direct activation of 5-HT
2B
receptors (Setola et al., 2003). Thus, the behavioral effect ofMDMA may be mediated, in part, through direct action on5-HT
2Breceptors or other central and/or peripheral recognition
sites, including /H92512-adrenergic receptors, for which these com-
pounds exhibit relatively high affinity (Battaglia et al., 1988).
To evaluate the role of 5-HT2Breceptors in mediating the
actions of MDMA, we used two parallel approaches: a pharma-
cological approach using the most selective 5-HT2Breceptor an -
tagonist currently known, 2-amino-4-(4-fluoronaphth-1-yl)-6-isopropylpyrimidine (RS127445) (Bonhaus et al., 1999), and agenetic approach using mice lacking the 5-HT
2Breceptor
(Nebigil et al., 2000). Our results demonstrate that functional
5-HT2Breceptors are required for MDMA-induced behavioral
effects and 5-HT release in vivo andin vitro .
Materials and Methods
Animals. 5-HT2B/H11002//H11002mice used in these experiments have a pure 129SV/
PAS background. Wild-type (WT) 129SV/PAS mice (8–10 weeks of age)
were used as a control group (Charles River Laboratories, L’Arbresle,France). No locomotor differences were seen between males and females,or between WT and 5-HT
2B/H11002//H11002mice, in response to MDMA or saline
injection. Groups were composed of 50% male and 50% female for each
experiment.
Reagents. MDMA (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France)
was dissolved in 0.9% (w/v) NaCl solution (saline); RS127445 (Bonhauset al., 1999) was kindly provided by Roche Bioscience (Indianapolis, IN)and slowly dissolved in saline solution. BW723C86 (Sigma-Aldrich) wasdissolved in saline solution. 1-[2-(Diphenylmethoxy)ethyl]-4-(3-phenylpropyl)-piperazine (GBR12935) (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolvedin water.
Locomotor activity. Locomotor activity was measured in a circular cor-
ridor with four infrared beams placed at every 90° (Imetronic, Passac,France). Counts were incremented by consecutive interruption of twoadjacent beams (i.e., mice moving through one-quarter of the corridor).Mice were injected with a saline solution and individually placed in theactivity box for 30 min durin g 3 d consecutively for habituation before
experiments.
Microdialysis. Anesthetized animals were placed in a stereotaxic frame
(David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA), and microdialysis probes wereimplanted in the raphe nuclei, ventral tegmental area (VTA), or nucleusaccumbens (NAcc). Dialysis probes were equipped with a Cuprophanmembrane (membrane length, 2 mm; diameter, 0.24 mm; cutoff, 5000Da; CMA Microdialysis, Solna, Sweden). Stereotaxic coordinates (inmm) were as follows: for raphe, anteroposterior (AP) /H110024.5, lateral (L)
/H110021.0, and dorsoventral (DV) /H110024.4 with a lateral angle of 20° from
bregma and top of the skull; for NAcc, AP /H110011.2, L/H110010.6, DV /H110024.2; for
VTA, AP /H110023.0, L/H110010.4, DV /H110024.0 both to bregma and dura surface.
Probes were perfused at a constant rate of 5
/H9262l/min with artificial CSF
containing 154.1 m MCl/H11002, 147 m MNa/H11001, 2.7 m MK/H11001,1m MMg2/H11001, and
1.2 m MCa2/H11001, adjusted to pH 7.4 with 2 m Msodium phosphate buffer.
Dialysates were collected every 10 min. All measurements were per-
formed 150 min after the beginning of perfusion, by which time a steadystate was achieved. Mice were injected with RS127445 (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.)1 h before MDMA injection (10 mg/kg). Absolute basal levels of 5-HTand DA in dialysate collected from the raphe were taken as the mean /H11006
SEM of four to five values. At the end of the experiment, all brains werefixed into a formaldehyde solution, and serial coronal slices were madeon a microtome. Histological examination of cannula tip placement wassubsequently made on 100
/H9262m safranine-stained coronal sections.
Dialysate samples were injected without any purification into an
HPLC system that consists of a pump linked to an automatic injector(Agilent 1100; Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA), a reverse-phasecolumn (Zorbax SB C18; 3.5 lm, 150 /H110034.6 mm; Agilent Technologies),
and a coulometric detector (Coulochem II; ESA, Chelmsford, MA) witha 5011 analytical cell to quantify DA or 5-HT. The first electrode was
fixed at /H11002100 mV and the second electrode at /H11001300 mV. The gain of the
detector was set at 50 nA. The signal of the second electrode was con-nected to an HP Chemstation for HPLC. The composition of the mobilephase was 50 m
MNaH2PO4, 0.1 m MNa2EDTA, 0.65 m Moctyl sodium
sulfate, and 14% (v/v) methanol, pH 3.5. The flow rate was set at 1
ml/min.
Synaptosomes. Crude synaptosomes were prepared as described previ-
ously (Gray and Whittaker, 1962). This preparation was used to measureMDMA-induced release of endogenously stored 5-HT (without [
3H]5-
HT preloading). 5-HT measurement was performed as for dialysate sam-
ples. Crude synaptosomes (0.25 mg of protein) were distributed ontocellulose mixed ester filters (0.65
/H9262m pore size; Millipore, Molsheim,
France) in a four-chamber superfusion apparatus held thermostaticallyat 37°C. The synaptosomes were layered onto the filters by aspirationfrom the bottom under moderate vacuum. Synaptosomes were preincu-bated at 37°C for 5 min with Krebs–Henseleit buffer with the followingcomposition (in m
M): 125 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.2 CaCl2, 1.2 MgSO4,1
NaH2PO4, 22 NaHCO3, and 10 glucose, gassed with 95% O2and 5%
CO2, pH 7.4. Then, MDMA (10 /H9262M) or buffer was added and incubated
at 37°C for 30 min followed by rapid filtration under vacuum (GF/B
filters; Whatman, Clifton, NJ).
Reverse transcription-PCR. Isolation of total RNA from raphe nucleus
was performed with the RNAsolv reagent (Omega-Biotek, Norcross,GA). Raphe nucleus was dissected from midbrain and homogenized in 2ml of RNAsolv using a Polytron homogenizer. Genomic DNA was re-moved by digestion with RNase-free DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 minat 25°C. First-strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription of 1
/H9262g of total RNA with Superscript-II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) according to standard protocols. Reverse transcriptasewas omitted in some samples as negative control. The sequences of theupstream and downstream oligonucleotides were as follows: 5 /H11032-

tions were performed with 1–2 U of TaqDNA polymerase, 1 m MMgSO4,
and 1 pg/ /H9262l selective primers for 30 cycles (1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 58°C,
and 45 s at 72°C). The identity of the PCR products has been verified bydirect sequence analysis.
Monoamine uptake and SERT/DA transporter binding in synaptosomes.
Whole-brain synaptosomes from three 5-HT
2B/H11002//H11002and WT mice used in
three experiments for [3H]5-HT (124 Ci/mmol; GE Healthcare, Velizy,
France) and [3H]DA (34.4 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer, Courtaboeuf,
France) uptake. The 5-HT or DA uptake was measured using six concen-
trations of [3H]5-HT (6–200 n M) and [3H]DA (7.8–250 n M). Brain
synaptosomes were added to tubes containing 120 m MNaCl, 20 m M
Tris /H18528HCl, 5 m MKCl, 1.2 m MMgSO4, 2.5 m MCaCl2,1 0m Mglucose, 1 m M
ascorbic acid, and 0.1 m Mpargyline plus [3H]5-HT or [3H]DA, and
uptake was allowed to occur for 10 min at 37°. Nonspecific [3H]5-HT
uptake was defined as the accumulation in the presence of 100 n Mpar-
oxetine and was subtracted from total uptake. Nonspecific [3H]DA up -
take was defined as the accumulation in the presence of 10 /H9262MGBR12935
and was subtracted from total uptake. The process was terminated byimmersing the tubes in ice-cold buffer followed by rapid filtrationthrough Whatman GF/B filters. Radioactivity was measured using liquidscintillation counting. For saturation binding assay on synaptosomesmembrane fraction, [
3H]citalopram varied from 0.6 to 20 n M. Nonspe -
cific binding was determined in the presence of 100 n Mparoxetine and
was subtracted from total binding. For [3H]GBR12935 (40 Ci/mmol;
PerkinElmer) binding, whole brain was homogenized with 25 ml of ice-
cold buffer containing 50 m MTris, 120 m MNaCl, and 5 m MMgCl2,p H
7.4. The homogenate was centrifuged for 20 min at 15,000 /H11003g. The pellet
was resuspended and centrifuged under the same condition three times.To the final suspension (0.6 mg/ml) was added [
3H]GBR12935 (2 n M)
and GBR12935 (1 n Mto 10/H9262M). Binding data were analyzed using the

Statistics. Locomotor activity and microdialysis data were analyzed
with two-way ANOVA repeated measures over time (mixed model) withdrug treatment or genotype as factors and locomotor behavior intervalsas the repeated measure. Post hoc analysis was done with Bonferroni test.
p/H110210.05 was the statistical criterion for null hypothesis rejection in these

Results
We first examined the effect of the highly selective and potent
5-HT2Breceptor antagonist RS127445 (0.5, 0.1, and 0.05 mg/kg)
on MDMA (10 mg/kg)-induced locomotion in WT mice (Fig.
1a,b). In agreement with previous studies (Bengel et al., 1998),
MDMA induced a marked locomotion in WT mice (Fig. 1 a).
However, pretreatment with RS127445 completely (0.5 and 0.1mg/kg) or partially (0.05 mg/kg) blocked MDMA-induced loco-motion in WT mice (Fig. 1 b). To rule out any nonspecific basal
locomotor effect of RS127445, we compared locomotor activityin mice injected with either RS127445 (0.5 mg/kg) or saline solu-tion (see supplemental Fig. 1, available at www.jneurosci.org assupplemental material). RS127445 had no effect on basal loco-motor activity. These data demonstrate that pharmacologicalblockade of the 5-HT
2Breceptor abolishes MDMA-induced
locomotion.
To confirm that MDMA-induced locomotion is 5-HT2Bre-
ceptor dependent, 5-HT2B/H11002//H11002mice were injected with either sa -
line or MDMA. Despite an increase in novelty-induced locomo-tion in 5-HT
2B/H11002//H11002mice compared with WT mice (see
supplemental Figs. 2, 3, available at www.jneurosci.org as supple-
mental material), there was no significant difference in the loco-motor activity of saline- or MDMA-treated 5-HT
2B/H11002//H11002mice
(F(1,528)/H110051.31; p/H110050.265) (Fig. 1 c). To preclude any interfering
behavior that could affect the interpretation of the results, general
activity (single beam activation), rearing, and putative MDMA-induced stereotypy were recorded. In particular, analysis ofRS127445-treated or 5-HT
2B/H11002//H11002mice did not reveal any signifi -
cant increase in MDMA-induced stereotypy (data not shown),which could be an explanation for the inhibition of MDMA-induced locomotion in those mice. Together, these results con-firm the involvement of 5-HT
2Breceptors in MDMA-induced
hyperlocomotion.
Serotonin and DA extracellular concentrations in the NAcc
and VTA are key components of MDMA-induced hyperactivity(Kankaanpaa et al., 1998; Bankson and Yamamoto, 2004). Wethus investigated the effect of genetic ablation or pharmacologi-cal inhibition of 5-HT
2Breceptors on the release of these mono -
amines by in vivo microdialysis in awake mice. Administration of
MDMA increased extracellular 5-HT concentration in WT mice/H1101180-fold within 70 min in both the NAcc (Fig. 2 a) and the VTA
(Fig. 2 d). In 5-HT
2B/H11002//H11002mice as well as in mice pretreated with
RS127445, MDMA caused no increase in extracellular 5-HT con-
centration in the NAcc (Fig. 2 b,c) and the VTA (Fig. 2 e,f). In WT
mice, MDMA caused an 80-fold increase in extracellular DA lev-els in the NAcc within 50 min (Fig. 3 a). However, in RS127445-
treated (Fig. 3 b) or 5-HT
2B/H11002//H11002mice (Fig. 3 c), MDMA caused no
increase in extracellular DA concentration in the NAcc. Thus, our
data demonstrate that functional 5-HT2Breceptors are necessary
for MDMA-evoked 5-HT and DA release in the NAcc and VTA.
To confirm that SERT expression in 5-HT2B/H11002//H11002and WT mice
is comparable, radioligand saturation binding assays with
[3H]citalopram were performed on synaptosomal membranes
prepared from whole brain (Fig. 4 a). Neither Bmax(WT: 120.2 /H11006
10.6 fmol/sample; 5-HT2B/H11002//H11002: 129.8/H1100611.8) nor KD(WT: 8.2 /H110061.6 n M; 5-HT2B/H11002//H11002: 8.4/H110061.6) was altered in 5-HT2B/H11002//H11002mice
compared with wild-type mice. SERT function was assessed in
wild-type and 5-HT2B/H11002//H11002mice by measuring [3H]5-HT uptake
by synaptosomes prepared from whole brain (Fig. 4 b). The re-
sulting saturation isotherms revealed no differences in eitherV
max(WT: 5.22 /H110060.3; 5-HT2B/H11002//H11002: 5.44/H110060.3 fmol/sample/min)
orKm(WT: 16.29 /H110063.8; 5-HT2B/H11002//H11002: 19.13/H110064.2 fmol/sample),
demonstrating that SERT uptake activity is not altered in
5-HT2B/H11002//H11002mice compared with wild-type mice. Similarly, DA
transporter (DAT) expression (Fig. 4 c) and function (Fig. 4 d)
were compared in WT and 5-HT2B/H11002//H11002mice. Radioligand bind -
ing assays with [3H]GBR12935 (selective ligand for DAT) were
performed on membranes prepared from whole brain (Fig. 4 c).
Neither Bmax (WT: 11688 /H110061459 fmol/mg; 5-HT2B/H11002//H11002:
10,484/H110061787) nor KD(WT: 7.12 /H110060.08 n M; 5-HT2B/H11002//H11002: 7.17/H11006
0.11) was altered in 5-HT2B/H11002//H11002mice compared with wild-type
mice. DAT function was assessed in wild-type and 5-HT2B/H11002//H11002
mice by measuring [3H]DA uptake by synaptosomes prepared
from whole brain (Fig. 4 d). The resulting saturation isotherms
revealed no differences in either Vmax (WT: 972 /H11006101;
5-HT2B/H11002//H11002: 1043/H1100686 fmol/mg/min) or Km(WT: 126 /H1100627;
5-HT2B/H11002//H11002: 127/H1100621 fmol/mg), demonstrating that DAT uptake
activity is not altered in 5-HT2B/H11002//H11002mice compared with wild-
type mice. Together these data rule out the possibility that the
observed effects on MDMA-induced behavior and 5-HT/DA re-lease in 5-HT
2B/H11002//H11002mice could be caused by decreased SERT/
DAT expression or uptake activity.
A previous study showed that 5-HT2Breceptor mRNA and
protein are coexpressed in SERT-expressing primary neurons
from mice raphe nuclei (Launay et al., 2006). Given the normalexpression and uptake activity of SERT in 5-HT
2B/H11002//H11002mice, we
hypothesized that the 5-HT2Breceptor acts presynaptically in
raphe neurons to permit MDMA-induced SERT-dependant
5-HT release. Using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, we firstconfirmed that 5-HT
2Breceptor mRNA is expressed in mouse
raphe nucleus, as previously observed in rats by DNA microarray
andin situ hybridization (Bonaventure et al., 2002). As shown in
Figure 5 a, samples of raphe nucleus from WT mice expressed
both 5-HT2Breceptor and SERT mRNA. In contrast, samples
from 5-HT2B/H11002//H11002mice expressed only SERT mRNA, confirming
the expression of the 5-HT2Breceptor mRNA in raphe nucleus of
WT mice. To evaluate the expression of functional 5-HT2Brecep -
tor proteins in the raphe nucleus, we next studied the effect ofBW723C86, a preferential 5-HT
2Breceptor agonist, on 5-HT ex -
tracellular concentration by in vivo microdialysis (Fig. 5 b). Local
infusion of BW723C86 (10 nmol) through the microdialysisprobe produced a fourfold increase in 5-HT concentration. Pre-treatment with RS127445 (100 n
M) completely blocked the
BW723C86-induced increase in 5-HT, whereas RS127445 alonehad no effect on basal 5-HT concentration. Thus, we confirmedin vivo the expression of 5-HT
2Breceptors in the murine raphe
nucleus and demonstrated a functional coupling of the receptor
to extracellular 5-HT levels.
Using a superfused mouse midbrain synaptosome prepara-
tion, we next sought to assess whether the MDMA-inducedSERT-dependent 5-HT release in vivo (i.e., microdialysis studies)
was similarly 5-HT
2Breceptor dependent in vitro in serotoniner -
gic nerve ending. As shown in Figure 6, MDMA (10 /H9262M) caused a
fivefold greater synaptosomal 5-HT release than saline in WTsynaptosomes. In contrast, MDMA did not increase 5-HT releaseover baseline levels from 5-HT
2B/H11002//H11002synaptosomes. Notably,
basal synaptosomal 5-HT release was similar for WT and
5-HT2B/H11002//H11002synaptosomes. Thus, our data show that activation ofDoly et al. •The 5-HT2BReceptor Mediates Ecstasy Effects J. Neurosci., March 12, 2008 •28(11):2933–2940 • 29355-HT2Breceptors in serotoninergic nerve ending particles is re -
quired for MDMA-induced SERT-dependent 5-HT release.
Discussion
Here we show that the most selective 5-HT2Breceptor antagonist
currently known, RS127445 (0.5 and 0.1 mg/kg), potently and
completely reverses the hyperactivity caused by a “conventional”dose (10 mg/kg) of MDMA in mice. RS-127445 was found tohave subnanomolar affinity for the 5-HT
2Breceptor (pKi/H110059.5/H11006
0.1) and at least 1000-fold selectivity for this receptor compared
with numerous other receptors and monoamine uptake sites(Bonhaus et al., 1999). Some of these receptors are of specialinterest in MDMA-induced locomotion, especially 5-HT
2A,
5-HT2C, and 5-HT1Breceptors, but also 5-HT and DA transport -
ers (Bankson and Cunningham, 2001). Thus, the results obtainedat such a low dose of RS127445 are unlikely caused by an inter-action of this compound with other receptors or transportersinvolved in MDMA-induced locomotion. Rather, the effect cansafely be attributed to the acute pharmacological inhibition of the5-HT
2Breceptor, because genetic deletion of the 5-HT2Breceptor
in 5-HT2B/H11002//H11002mice gives rise to an identical phenotype vis-a `-vis
MDMA-induced hyperactivity.
Previous studies showed that systemic injection of MDMA
increased extracellular levels of 5-HT in the NAcc and VTA, asmeasured by microdialysis (Gudelsky and Nash, 1996; Crespi etal., 1997; Kankaanpaa et al., 1998). The psychomotor stimulanteffect of MDMA is considered subsequent to an extracellularincrease of 5-HT in these nuclei, as demonstrated by its elimina-tion by 5-HT-specific reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or in SERT
/H11002//H11002
mice (Bengel et al., 1998; Bankson and Cunningham, 2001; Trigo
et al., 2007). Here we show that blockade of the 5-HT2Breceptor
also completely prevents the MDMA-induced increase of 5-HT
in the NAcc and VTA. Moreover, using RT-PCR and in vivo
microdialysis, we show that mRNA and functional 5-HT2Brecep -
tor protein are expressed in the mouse raphe nucleus. Because theNAcc and VTA ascending serotonergic projections arise from thedorsal raphe nuclei and given that raphe neurons are the princi-pal source of 5-HT release in the brain, this result supports thenotion that the 5-HT
2Breceptor acts presynaptically in sero -
toninergic raphe neurons to permit MDMA-induced SERT-dependent 5-HT release. However, 5-HT release from serotoner-gic neurons is controlled through complex and multiple neuralinputs to 5-HT cell bodies and nerve terminals (Adell et al., 2002;Sharp et al., 2007). Thus, indirect regulation of MDMA-induced5-HT release, by other afferent inputs expressing 5-HT
2Brecep -
tor, could also explain the lack of 5-HT release seen in vivo in
5-HT2B/H11002//H11002or RS127445-treated mice. Nevertheless, that
MDMA-stimulated endogenous 5-HT release from superfused
midbrain synaptosome preparation is similarly 5-HT2Breceptor
dependent strongly argues against any indirect influence of nerve
inputs and reinforces the hypothesis that 5-HT2Breceptor acts
presynaptically in serotoninergic raphe neurons to permit
MDMA-induced 5-HT release. To our knowledge, a contribu-tion of presynaptic 5-HT autoreceptors in MDMA-induced be-havioral effect or 5-HT release, such as the one revealed here for5-HT
2Breceptors, has not yet been described. Along these lines,
with respect to the 5-HT1Band 5-HT1Aautoreceptors, 5-HT1B
receptors have been shown to mediate their effect postsynapti-
cally vis-a `-vis MDMA-induced hyperlocomotion (Bankson and
Cunningham, 2001), whereas the 5-HT1Areceptor had no effect
(Muller et al., 2007).
That MDMA-evoked 5-HT release is completely abolished in
5-HT2B/H11002//H11002mice and in RS127445-treated WT mice suggests that

release. Also, MDMA exhibits moderate agonist potency (100n
M) and relative efficacy (50%) at 5-HT2Breceptors (Setola et al.,
2003). Thus, it is conceivable that activation of 5-HT2Breceptorsby MDMA somehow renders SERT capable of MDMA-induced
5-HT release. Alternatively, simple coexpression of 5-HT2Bre-
ceptors and SERT in 5-HT-releasing terminals may suffice for theformer protein to render the latter molecule able to release 5-HT.

findings indicate that monoamine trans-porters are highly regulated at the cellularand molecular levels (Torres et al., 2003).SERT reuptake activity is controlled by sev-eral intracellular signaling pathways(Blakely et al., 1998), including histamineand adenosine A3 receptor-associated PKGsignaling pathways (Launay et al., 1994;Miller and Hoffman, 1994; Zhu et al.,2007). Control of SERT by 5-HT
2Brecep -
tors has been recently detailed: in embry-onic raphe neurons, the 5-HT
2Breceptor
coupling to PKG-dependent NO produc-
tion ensures SERT phosphorylation tobasal level (Launay et al., 2006). Such abasal level of SERT phosphorylation, asso-ciated with a maximal transport capacity incell line, is likely to result from the 5-HT
2B
receptor intrinsic activity (Manivet et al.,2000). Indeed, PKG-mediated control of5-HT uptake by SERT was recently con-firmed independently (Ramamoorthy etal., 2007). In the presence of 5-HT, how-ever, the 5-HT
2Breceptor–PKC coupling
promotes additional phosphorylations of
both SERT and Na/H11001,K/H11001-ATPase
/H9251-subunit, impairing the electrochemical
gradient necessary for 5-HT uptake (Lau-nay et al., 2006). However, the control ofSERT-induced MDMA or amphetamineanalog-dependent 5-HT release has re-ceived far less attention. Acute in vivo stim-
ulation of 5-HT
2Breceptors by norfenflu -
ramine (the main metabolite of the anorexigen fenfluramine, a5-HT releaser and 5-HT
2Breceptor agonist) or BW723C86 trig -
gers a transient SERT-dependent increase in plasma 5-HT that isblocked by RS127445 or genetic ablation. This increase in plasma5-HT concentration is induced by SERT-mediated 5-HT releaseinstead of uptake inhibition, because paroxetine (an SSRI) hadno effect on basal 5-HT plasma concentration (Callebert et al.,2006). An in vivo monoamine transporter regulation by phos-
phorylation has been proposed for amphetamine-triggered DAefflux through DAT (Fog et al., 2006). Amphetamine stimulatesPKC activity that is associated with the outward transport of DA(Mortensen and Amara, 2003), and phosphorylation of serines inthe N terminus of the human DAT is essential for amphetamine-induced, DAT-mediated DA efflux with no alterations of DATexpression or uptake activity (Khoshbouei et al., 2004). Our find-ings support the hypothesis that 5-HT
2Breceptor genetic ablation
or pharmacological inhibition impairs also SERT release activity
in such a way that MDMA-induced 5-HT release is abolishedwithout alterations of SERT expression or uptake activity.
When access to SERT is blocked by fluoxetine (an SSRI), the
MDMA-evoked DA efflux in the striatum is reduced. Moreover,tetrodotoxin infusion in the striatum reduces the extracellularconcentration of DA evoked by MDMA (Gudelsky and Nash,1996). In other words, MDMA-induced DA release involvesstimulation of postsynaptic 5-HT receptors after SERT-dependent 5-HT release (Gudelsky and Nash, 1996; Bankson andCunningham, 2001). These data are supportive of a stimulatoryrole of 5-HT in the regulation of dopamine release. Moreover,DAT expression and function are not altered in 5-HT
2B/H11002//H11002mice.Thus, inhibition of DA release in NAcc seen in 5-HT2B/H11002//H11002and in
RS127445-treated mice after MDMA administration (Fig. 3 b,c)
may be attributed to the absence of 5-HT release in VTA and/orNAcc, where postsynaptic 5-HT
2A(Bankson and Yamamoto,
2004) and 5-HT3(De Deurwaerdere et al., 1998) receptors have
stimulatory effect, respectively. Whether non-5-HT-selective re-
leasers such as D-amphetamine may also be affected by 5-HT2B
receptor activity is currently under investigation in our labora-tory. Additional studies are also underway to ascertain the director indirect role of 5-HT
2Breceptor in the action of MDMA on DA
release.
There are currently no pharmacological treatments for the
wide range of symptoms associated with MDMA abuse (Morton,2005). DA increase in the NAcc plays a critical role in reward and
drug dependence and is a common response generated by alldrugs of abuse, including MDMA (Nestler, 2005). The absence ofDA release indicates that mice lacking functional 5-HT
2Brecep -
tor should not exhibit conditioned place preference or self ad-ministration with a “conventional” dose of MDMA, i.e., 10 mg/kg. The identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the5-HT
2Breceptor gene among drug abusers supports the notion
that this receptor could be involved in drug-reinforcing mecha-
nisms in humans (Lin et al., 2004). Moreover, although still amatter of debate, repeated administration of MDMA to animalsproduces 5-HT and DA release-dependent neurotoxicity. UnlikeSSRIs (fluoxetine, paroxetine, or citalopram), RS127445 has noeffect on basal 5-HT extracellular concentration, suggesting that5-HT
2Breceptor antagonists could serve as a promising thera -
