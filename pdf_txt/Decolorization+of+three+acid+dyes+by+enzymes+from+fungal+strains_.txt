by newly isolated Leptosphaerulina  sp. 
from Colombia

Abstract  
Background:  Wastewaters from the textile industry are an environmental problem for the well ‑known Colombian 
textile industry. Ligninolytic fungi and their enzymes are an option for the treatment of these wastewaters; how‑
ever, the Colombian biodiversity has not been deeply evaluated for fungal strains with ligninolytic activities. In this 
research, 92 Colombian fungal isolates were collected from four locations around the Aburrá valley, Antioquia, Colom‑
bia. Their decolorizing activities were evaluated using Novacron Red, Remazol Black and Turquoise Blue in solid and 
liquid media at different culture conditions. The best fungal isolate was evaluated in the bioremediation of two real 
effluents and its enzymatic extracts were used in the decolorization of the three dyes.
Results:  From 92 Colombian fungal isolates, Leptosphaerulina  sp. exhibited the best decolorization percentage 
(>90  %) in solid and liquid cultures, and in agitated and un ‑agitated conditions. Leptosphaerulina  sp. effectively decol‑
orized the three dyes and two real effluents from textile industries. This decolorization was catalyzed by the produc‑
tion of significant quantities of laccase (650  U/L) and manganese peroxidase (100  U/L). Leptosphaerulina  sp. enzymatic 
extracts exhibited decolorizing activity when ABTS as mediator was added. Leptosphaerulina  sp. decolorized two real 
effluents from textile industries (>90  %) under conditions of low pH and glucose supplementation. Enzymatic degra‑
dation and decolorization products’ innocuity was demonstrated by cytotoxic and chromatographic analyses.
Conclusion:  Leptosphaerulina  sp. was the best Colombian isolate. This fungal strain achieved a decolorization above 
90 % for the three dyes and two real effluents from a textile industry. This decolorization was performed by produc‑
ing significant amounts of laccase and manganese peroxidase. Leptosphaerulina  sp. is an interesting prospect to treat 
waters polluted with dyes without the production of compounds dangerous for the environment.

The Colombian textile industry has national and inter -
national acknowledgements by its quality and tradition. 
However, this industry faces different environmental 
problems, one of which occurs during the fabrics dyeing. 
Dyeing environmental problems are related to the large 
demand of water and the presence of remaining dyes in their effluents. In fact, 1  kg of dyed textile requires 
100  L of water generating an effluent with a dye con -
tent between 5 and 50  % (Abadulla et  al. 2000 ). These 
wastewaters are disposed in rivers and creeks all around 
the country, generating significant pollution. Chemical 
dyes pollute waters by changing its color and generating 
harmful effects to the aquatic ecosystems. Besides the 
anti-aesthetic effect produced in the effluents, the col -
oration reduces the solar light transmittance, affecting 
the aquatic organisms’ photosynthetic activity (Michnie -
wicz et al. 2008 ). Additionally, some dyes have exhibited Open Access

mutagenic and carcinogenic effects (Weisburger 2002). 
The traditional technologies to degrade synthetic dyes (physical, physicochemical and biological) are not effi
-
cient enough. In these technologies, the dyes are trans -
ferred to other matrices (i.e., microbial cells) or the dyes degradation products become more toxic than the origi
-
nal dyes (Zouari-Mechichi et al. 2006).
An environmentally friendly strategy to degrade tex -
tile dyes is the application of ligninolytic fungi and their enzymes. Ligninolytic fungi developed an enzymatic sys
-
tem composed by three principal enzymes: laccase (E.C 
1.10.3.2), lignin peroxidase (LiP) (E.C 1.11.1.14), and 
manganese peroxidase (MnP) (E.C. 1.11.1.13). Laccase or benzenediol: oxygen oxidoreductase belongs to the oxidoreductases class (Dias et  al. 2007). The most refer
-
enced and well-known laccases belong to the wood-decay fungi or white-rot fungi. Wood decay fungi utilize these enzymes to degrade the recalcitrant structure that consti
-
tutes lignin and facilitate the access to hemicellulose and cellulose. Laccases have the advantages of being extra
-
cellular, inducible, low substrate specificity and an inex -
pensive cofactor (oxygen) (Zouari-Mechichi et  al. 2006; Sergio 2006; Couto and Toca-Herrera 2006). On the other 
hand, LiP and MnP belong to the peroxidases subclass and can catalyze the degradation of a wide number of aro

matic structures, they are produced by the white rot fungi to participate in the initial states of the lignin degrada
-
tion (MnP) (Angel 2002; Hammel and Cullen 2008) or the degradation of aromatic rings moderately activated (LiP) (Khindaria et  al. 1996). Therefore, ligninolytic fungi and their enzymes have been used in the degradation of differ
-
ent types of compounds as lignin, aromatic compounds, textile dyes, etc. (dos Santos et al. 2007).
Several fungi with ligninolytic activities (i.e., Bjerkan
-
dera adusta, Trametes versicolor, Phanerochaete chrys -
osporium ) have proved their efficiency for treating textile 
dyes (dos Santos et al. 2007). However, each isolate gen -
erates a different enzymatic profile, a different response to environmental variables and different levels of dyes decolorization (Nyanhongo et  al. 2002). Agitation, car
-
bon and nitrogen source, and inducers (aromatic com -
pounds, copper) are environmental factors that have been associated with the modification of the enzymatic production and/or the decolorization activity. However, the positive or negative effect of these factors is greatly related with the type of fungal strain evaluated. An exam
-
ple of this differences is the nitrogen concentration, low-nitrogen concentration has been found as favorable for Cyathus bulleri and Phlebia tremellosa (Salony et al. 
2006; Robinson et  al. 2001) whereas, Pestalotiopsis sp. and Bjekandera adusta showed greater enzymatic and 
decolorizing activity when the culture medium had nitro
-
gen availability (Robinson et al. 2001; Hao et al. 2007).In addition to fungal decolorization, synthetic dyes 
can be decolorized by using enzymatic extracts, puri -
fied or semi-purified enzymes, and commercial or native enzymes (Mattinen et al. 2011). Enzymatic decol
-
orization have been performed by using individual or a mixture of ligninolytic enzymes, generally laccase is the main enzyme followed by MnP and LiP (Costa et al. 2005; Archibald et al. 1997). The principal advan
-
tage of enzymatic processes is the ability to obtain the same removal than microbial pretreatment in less time (between 2 and 48 h). However, some enzymes are not able to produce the same results when in  vivo than in vitro. Therefore, some approaches have been utilized to increase the range of dyes degraded, the decoloriza
-
tion percentage, and the removal time (Zouari-Mechichi et  al. 2006; Kokol et  al. 2007). The principal strategy is 
the use of mediators. Mediators are chemical com
-
pounds, which act as electron carriers between the enzyme and the final substrate (Babot et  al. 2011). The use of fungal laccases in presence of redox mediators is known as laccase-mediator system (LMS). The two most common mediators are 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT) and 2,2′ -azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic 
acid) (ABTS). A greater degree of degradation using LMS is based in a high level of interaction between the enzyme and its mediator; in fact, not all the mediators produce the same effect with enzymes from different origins (Nyanhongo et al. 2002).
Enzymatic or fungal processes using ligninolytic fungi 
and their enzymes are a promising technology to solve the dyes pollution generated by the Colombian textile industry. However, the fungal strains evaluated in the treatment of textiles dyes have been isolated from envi

ronmental and geographical conditions different than Colombia. Therefore, to apply this type of technology in Colombia, it is necessary to evaluate the Colombian microflora and their ligninolytic and decolorizing activi

Methods
Fungal strains
Ninety two fungi were isolated from four locations (cloud forest (CF), Montane rainforest (MRF), Medellin’s Botanic Garden (BG) and an industrial and residential zone (IRZ)) around the Aburrá valley, Antioquia, Colom
-
bia. The strains were conserved in potato dextrose agar (PDA) at 4 °C until use.Page 3 of 14

Textile dyes
The dyes evaluated in this research were Novacron Red 
(azoic dye, λmax =  514  nm), Remazol Black (azoic dye, 
λmax =  598  nm), and Turquoise Blue (phthalocyanine 
dye, λmax = 622 nm and 669 nm). Additionally, two types 
of real textile wastewaters were used. First, a dyeing bath effluent and second, the final effluent released into Medellin river. All dyes and effluents were kindly donated by Fabricato-Tejicondor S.A.
Evaluation of ligninolytic and decolorizing activity in solid 
media
The ligninolytic activity was measured in petri dishes 
with malt extract medium supplemented with 2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) also known as ABTS. The petri dish was inoculated with the isolated fungus and was incubated 2  weeks at 30  °C. The enzy
-
matic activity was evaluated by the formation of a green or violet halo. The fungal strains that exhibited lignino
-
lytic activity were selected for the decolorizing activity experiment. The decolorizing trials used malt extract agar supplemented with each dye. The fungi were culti
-
vated during 20  days at 28  °C. The decolorizing activity was described as positive when the solid media exhib
-
ited partial or total loss of color. The fungal strains with decolorizing activity were selected for the liquid media evaluation.
Selection of decolorizing fungal strains
The fungal strains selection was performed in two phases. The first phase employed a completely rand
-
omized block design with three replicates. All the strains selected in the solid media experiment were evaluated in each dye. The culture was carried out in Erlenmeyer flasks with 50 mL of malt extract liquid media, 200 ppm of dye and an inoculum of four cylinders from the fun
-
gus. The fungal strains were cultured during 15  days at room temperature (20–25  °C) without agitation. At the end of the 15  days, the fungi with the largest decolori
-
zation percentage in each dye were selected for the next phase. The second phase of the selection process uti
-
lized the fungal strains selected in the unagitated culture, Kirk’s media and agitation. The experiment employed a factorial design with three replicates. The experiment’s factors were the selected fungi and ammonium tartrate concentration (0.22, 5, and 10  g/L). The fungal strains were cultivated during 15 days at room temperature and 150  rpm. The experiment’s statistical analysis employed SAS 9.3 software. After that, a decolorization kinetic was performed for the treatments that exhibited the larg
-
est decolorization in each dye. The kinetic described the decolorization percentage, enzymatic activity, biomass, pH, protein concentration, glucose consumption, and adsorption. In order to determine the decolorization 
kinetic, Kirk’s media was employed, with 200 ppm of dye, 
during 21 days at 25 °C and 150 rpm.
Selected fungus identification
The fungal isolate that presented the largest decoloriza -
tion was molecular identified by analyzing the ITS and DNAr 28S sequences. The PCR used the following prim
-
ers: ITS1 (5′ TCC GTA GGT GAA CCT GCG G 3′) and ITS4 (5′ TCC TCC GCT TAT TGA TAT GC 3′) and DNAr 28S LROR (5′ ACC CGC TGA ACT TAA GC 3′) and LR6 (5′ CGC CAG TTC TGC TTA CC 3′) (Chanagá Vera et al. 2012). The sequences analysis was performed in the BLAST software.
Enzymatic extracts experiment
The enzymatic extracts from the fungi with the larg -
est enzymatic activity were evaluated in order to know their decolorizing activity. The cultures using the best fungus were stopped on the day with the largest enzy
-
matic production. On this day, the media was centrifuged 10 min at 5000 rpm, after which, the supernatants were micro-filtrated and lyophilized. The enzymatic extracts experiment was performed for each dye, using a mix
-
ture of lyophilized extract (50 ppm), ABTS (2 mM), dye (50  ppm) and buffer pH 3. The enzymatic reaction was kept for 24 h at 25 °C and 150 rpm. The experiment had three replicates and the decolorization percentage as response variable. The statistical analysis was performed using the SAS 9.3 software.
Fungal decolorization of real textile wastewaters
The fungus with the greatest decolorization ability was evaluated with two types of textile wastewaters (the final effluent disposed into Medellin river and a fabrics dye bath). The final effluent was evaluated under a completely randomized factorial design 2  × 2 × 2 with three repli
-
cates and using the decolorization percentage as response variable. The experiment’s factors were medium supple
-
mentation (10  g/L of glucose and 5  g/L of ammonium tartrate), pH (as received and pH 5) and inoculum (4 and 8 cylinders). The fabrics dyeing bath was evaluated under a completely randomized factorial design 2  ×  2 ×  2, 
using as factors medium supplementation (10 g/L of glu
-
cose and 5 g/L of ammonium tartrate), inoculum (4 and 8 cylinders) and effluent dilution [as received (6.8 g/L) and 200 ppm]. The decolorization was carried out in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks with 50 mL of medium, during 21 days at 25 °C and 150 rpm.
Enzymatic activities
The laccase activity was calculated using the enzy -
matic oxidation of ABTS. The reaction was followed Page 4 of 14 Plácido et al. Bioresour. Bioprocess.  (2016) 3:6 
spectrophotometrically by employing the change in the 
absorbance at 420 nm and a molar extinction coefficient of ε
420, 36,000/M/cm. The LiP activity was obtained by 
following the formation of veratryl aldehyde from verat -
ryl alcohol at 310 nm (ε310, 9300/M/cm). The MnP activ -
ity was calculated by measuring the absorbance change at 469  nm produced by the oxidation of 2,6-dimethoxype
-
nol (DMF) (ε469, 27,500/M/cm). All the enzymatic activi -
ties were reported in units (U), which were defined as the quantity of enzyme that catalyze 1 µmol of substrate per minute.
Analytical methods
The decolorizing activity was calculated using the decol -
orization percentage decolorization %=A0−Af
A0×100,  
where A0 is the initial dye absorbance at the dye’s 
λmax and Af is the final absorbance at the dye’s λmax 
(Mohorčič et  al. 2006). The decolorizing activity was considered high when the decolorization percentage was above 80 %, medium when it was between 50 and 80  % and low when it was below 50  %. The error bars utilized in the decolorization percentage measurements corresponds to the standard error. To evaluate biomass adsorption, the biomass was re-suspended in methanol for 30 min, and the methanol solution was used to cal
-
culate the absorbance at the dye λmax. In order to obtain 
the biomass production, after the methanol extraction, the biomass was dried at 105  °C for 24  h until obtain constant weight. The glucose determination was per
-
formed using the 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) meth -
odology. The protein concentration was obtained by the Bradford’s method. Dyes’ degradation products were analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) cytotoxicity test. Lyophilized extracts from fungal cultures were employed for both analyses. In the TLC, the lyophilized extracts were solubilized in different organic solvents (methanol, acetonitrile, ethyl acetate, and hexane). Each organic extract was spotted in the solid phase (silica gel U60 plates) and its respec
-
tive extraction solvent was used as mobile phase. The degradation-products toxicity was evaluated using the MTT test. This test evaluated the effect of the lyophi
-
lized extracts in the cell-viability percentage of human cell line U937 (Gallego et al. 2006). The cytotoxicity was 
measured by comparing the absorbance (595 nm) pro
-
duced by the control cells and the absorbance produced by the cells exposed to different concentration of the lyophilized extracts (500, 250, 125, 62.5, 31.2, 15.6, and 7.81 ppm). A compound was considered toxic, when the absorbance of the cells exposed to the compound exhib
-
ited an absorbance lower than the control’s absorbance (Gallego et al. 2006).Results
Evaluation of ligninolytic and decolorizing activity in solid 
media
In total, 92 fungi were collected from the four isolation 
locations. The strains were obtained from different types of lignocellulosic material (composted biomass, trees, discomposing trees etc.). The isolates distribution by site was IRZ (15), BG (32), CF (25), and MRF (20). After iso
-
lation and strains purification, the fungi were inoculated in solid malt extract media supplemented with ABTS. In solid media was possible to observe green and purple halos and a combination of both halos. The purple halos were observed after the production of small green halos. The halo formation fluctuated from hours (12–24  h) to days (2–12  days). In total, 30 of 92 isolates exhibited ligninolytic activity. The isolates ID and isolation location are described in Table  1. The total percentage of fungi 
with enzymatic activity was 32 % and the percentages of positive fungi by sites were IRZ (60 %), BG (15.6 %), CF (40 %), and MRF (32 %).
The 30 selected isolates were evaluated in malt extract 
agar with each of the three dyes (Novacron red, Rema
-
zol black, and Turquoise blue). In this case, an isolate was classified as positive for decolorizing activity when the media exhibited partial or total decolorization. In total, 15 fungi exhibited decolorizing activity which corre
-
sponds to 50 % of the preselected fungi and 16.3 % of the original isolated fungi. The percentage of positive isolates was relatively high. In fact, other reports with more than 50 isolates obtained 5.7 % (Hernández-Luna et al. 2008) 
and 10 % (Risna and Suhirman 2002) of fungi with decol
-
orizing activity. The fungal isolates with decolorizing activity and their level of decolorization are reported in Table  2. Remazol black was degraded by 12 strains, two of 
which (LVN6 and LVN63) showed the greatest decolori
-
zation. Additionally, LVN6 and LVN63 obtained the fast -
est decolorization with 5 and 3 days, respectively. Similar decolorization velocity have been reported in P. chrys
-
osporium  (Máximo et  al. 2003), T. versicolor (Mohorčič 
et al. 2006), Bjerkandera adusta and T. versicolor (Novo -
tný et al. 2004). In contrast, the other fungal strains took from 8 to 15  days in decolorize Remazol Black. On the other hand, Turquoise blue obtained the largest number of fungal strains with decolorization (13 strains); how
-
ever, the decolorization realized by the fungal strains had medium or low level (Table  2). In Turquoise Blue, the 
greatest decolorization was obtained after day 15. Oppo
-
site to Turquoise Blue, Novacron Red obtained the lowest number of fungal isolates (4) with decolorizing activity. This low quantity of positive strains was related to the dye’s monoazoic structure. Monoazoic dyes have been reported in different studies to exhibit a high difficulty to be degraded by ligninolytic fungi. This difficulty is Page 5 of 14

associated with the enzyme access to the dye’s azo group 
(–N = N–) (Máximo et al. 2003; Park et al. 2007).
Selection of decolorizing fungal strains
The fungal strains selection was performed in two phases. The first phase was a preselection study employing malt extract medium without agitation. Whereas, the second phase was an experiment using agitation, Kirk’s medium and variations in the nitrogen concentration.Fungal strains preselection
The preselection experiment was carried out with the 15 isolates that exhibited decolorization activity in solid media (Fig.  1). This experiment evidenced that 
all the strains generated decolorization; however, the removal level varied among strains and dyes. The varia
-
tion between solid and liquid media is explained by the changes in environmental conditions, it has been found that fungi behaves different between solid and submerged cultures, in fact, enzymes production is favored by grow
-
ing in solid surfaces improving the enzymatic activity and the enzymatic profile (Novotný et  al. 2004). In Remazol Black, the isolates LVN6, LVN88, and LVN63 exhibited the highest removal (>80  %), whereas the other fungi removal percentages varied between 20 and 80  %. The results between solid and liquid experiments were simi
-
lar in LVN6 and LVN63; in both, they achieved the larg -
est decolorization. In Novacron Red, the fungal isolates LVN80, LVN61, LVN6, LVN63 and LVN88 exhibited the most significant decolorization. From these fungi, LVN61 was the only strain with high decolorization in the liquid experiment and low decolorization in the solid experiment. The high removal observed in Novacron Red, under non-agitated conditions, is not common. In fact, monoazoic dyes had low or none decolorization under non-agitated conditions (Jarosz-Wilkołazka et  al. 2002; Swamy and Ramsay 1999). Turning now to turquoise blue, 
five strains (LVN6, LVN49, LVN63, LVN80, and LVN72) obtained decolorization around 70 % or more. This result is promissory because under non-agitation conditions other phthalocyanines dyes have not been decolorized by other fungal strains (Swamy and Ramsay 1999).
The experiment’s statistical analysis (see Addi

gal isolates for each dye (Table  3). The isolates selected 
were LVN6, LVN63, LVN80, LVN88, LVN61, LVN49, and 
LVN72. The decolorization percentage of the selected fungal strains were around 85 % (see Fig.  1). These values 
were similar to the values achieved by cultures without agitation of Phlebia tremellosa, Irpex lacteus, and basidi
-
omycete strain PV 002 (Kirby et  al. 2000; Svobodová et al. 2008). The isolates LVN6 and LVN63 were the only 
strains with high removal in all the dyes evaluated. The ability of decolorize different types of dyes, under non-agitation conditions, was reported in a small number of fungal strains (Kirby et al. 2000; Erkurt et al. 2007).
Fungal strains selection
The fungal strains selection was performed in Kirk’s medium with agitation and three different concentra
-
tions of ammonium tartrate. The fungal strains used in each dye are shown in Table  3. The experiment employed 
a factorial design, using as factors the selected micro
-
organism for each dye and the three concentrations of ammonium tartrate. The factorial design produced nine treatments for Remazol Black and 15 treatments for Novacron Red and Turquoise Blue. The decolorization percentages obtained by each treatment are shown in Fig. 2.
Remazol Black experiments showed LVN6 as the best 
fungal strain (>90 %). In this dye, LVN6 at the three con
-
centrations of ammonium tartrate realized decoloriza -
tion greater than the other fungal strains (Fig.  2a). The 
statistical analysis showed interaction between the fac -
tors; therefore, the treatments selection was performed using the interaction plots (see Additional file  1: Annex 
S1). The interaction plots evidenced the greatest decol
-
orization in the treatments with LVN6 and 5 and 10 g/L of ammonium tartrate. In contrast, LVN63 obtained the highest removal at 0.22  g/L of ammonium tartrate; this behavior was also detected in Novacron Red. The decol
-
orizing activity observed in LVN6 [5  g/L] and LVN6 [10  g/L] was similar to Bjerkandera adusta, Trametes versicolor, Funalia trogii and Irpex Lacteus, strains rec

ognized by their high decolorizing activity over Remazol Black (Mohorčič et  al. 2006; Park et  al. 2007; Máximo and Costa-Ferreira 2004). In Remazol Black, the selected treatment was LVN6 [5  g/L] because it produced the highest decolorization with the lowest consumption of ammonium tartrate.
The highest removals were achieved in Turquoise 
Blue. In this dye, almost all the treatments presented removals above 50  %. In this dye, three strains (LVN6, LVN72 and LVN49) obtained decolorizations above 90 % (Fig.  2b). The decolorization obtained by LVN6, LVN72 
and LVN49 is comparable with the removal obtained by P. simplicissimum  INCQS40211, P. chrysosporium,  and 
Ph. Tremellosa over Turquoise Blue. In these strains, the removal was above 94 % (Kirby et al. 2000; Bergsten-Tor

tions of 5 and 10 g/L of ammonium tartrate as the best concentrations to obtain high decolorization. In this dye, the best treatments were LVN49 [5 g/L], LVN72 [5 g/L], and LVN6 [5  g/L]. However, the treatments LVN49 [5 g/L] and LVN72 [5 g/L] were not employed in further experiments because its lack of efficiency over the other two dyes.
Novacron Red experiment exhibited LVN6 [5 g/L] and 
LVN6 [10 g/L] as the treatments with the greatest decol

orization percentages (>85  %) (Fig.  2c). On contrary, 
the other fungal strains had a reduction in the decolor -
izing ability, in comparison with the unagitated experi -
ment. This reduction can be explained by the changes in the growth media and the inclusion of agitation. The statistical analysis (see Additional file  1: Annex S1) 
exhibited significant differences among the treatments and an interaction between the factors. The interaction plots revealed 10 and 5  g/L of ammonium tartrate and LVN6 as the best treatments for Novacron Red decolori

zation. The removal obtained by LVN6 [5 g/L] (85.3 %) and LVN6 [10 g/L] (88.5 %) was larger than the reported by other fungal strains at similar or greater concentra
-
tions (≥ 200 ppm) of monoazoic dyes (Jarosz-Wilkołazka 
et al. 2002). The treatment LVN6 [5 g/L] was selected as 
the best option for the decolorization of Novacron Red, because it reached a similar decolorization than LVN6 [10  g/L], using half of the concentration of ammonium tartrate.
Molecular identification of the isolate LVN6
The ITS region (DNAr) and DNAr 28S from LVN6 were amplified to identify the molecular identity of this strain. The amplification of these DNA sequences generated bands of 500–600 pair of bases (pb) for ITS, and 1100 pb for DNAr 28S. The BLAST analysis and sequence iden
-
tity of ITS and DNAr 28S identified the fungi LVN6 as a member of the genre Leptosphaerulina. A specie deter
-
mination using the blast analysis was not possible. In this strain, the sequences of the ITS region and DNAr 28S were homologous to two different species of Lepto
-
sphaerulina. The ITS region’s sequence was homologue to Leptosphaerulina Americana, whereas DNAr 28S’ 
sequence was homologous to L. australis. The phylo
-
genetic and morphological analysis of these sequences did not allow the complete identification of this strain (Chanagá Vera et  al. 2012). At this moment, this is the 
first report demonstrating the decolorizing activity in the genre Leptosphaerulina. The ability of Leptosphaer
-
ulina  sp. to decolorize solutions with dyes can be related to the presence of ligninolytic enzymes. Likewise, L. 
chartarum  and L. briosiana have been described as 
ligninolytic enzymes producers (Simon et al. 1979; Saj -
ben-Nagy et al. 2014).
Decolorization kinetics
Figure  3a, b shown the Remazol Black decolorization 
kinetic. In the first 5 days, Remazol Black decolorization was approximately 30  %; however, after seven days, it increased above 90 %. The decolorization was correlated with the increment in the enzymatic production (Fig.  3a). 
Leptosphaerulina sp. produced laccase and MnP during all the kinetic. In Remazol Black, the greatest production of enzymes started at day 7 and had its maximum pro
-
duction around day 15. The highest production of laccase and MnP was 650  U/L and 100  U/L, respectively. Tur
-
quoise Blue decolorization kinetic exhibited a removal above 90 % in 3 days (Fig.  3c, d). The initial removal was 
performed by an adsorption process. The Turquoise Blue high adsorption can be related to the copper molecule in the core of the dye structure. After the day 5, the adsorp
-
tion process was replaced by the enzymatic process. The enzymatic catalysis removed the dye particles attached to the fungal biomass. This removal was catalyzed by laccase and MnP production. The largest enzymatic production was observed at day 9 with a laccase activity of 512 U/L and a MnP activity of 100 U/L. The Novacron Red decol
-
orization kinetic by Leptosphaerulina sp. [5 g/L] (Fig.  3e, 
f) showed a removal greater than 90 % and the produc -
tion of ligninolytic enzymes. The highest decolorization achieved by Leptosphaerulina sp. was obtained in 9 days, the enzymatic production was observed during all the kinetic; nevertheless, the highest enzymatic activities of laccase and MnP were observed on the 30th day with 647 U/L and 90 U/L, respectively.
Enzymatic decolorization using Leptosphaerulina sp. 
extracts
The enzymatic degradation of the three dyes was evalu -
ated by employing a commercial laccase and ABTS as 
mediator (see Additional file  1: Annex S1). The in  vitro 
analysis showed that all the dyes were decolorized by the commercial laccase; however, the level of decolori
-
zation varied depending on the dye and ABTS concen -
trations. The highest decolorization was obtained in Turquoise Blue (83 %), followed by Remazol Black (80 %), and Novacron Red (56  %). The greatest decolorizations were achieved by the treatments with ABTS as media
-
tor (2 mM) and the highest commercial enzyme concen -
tration (2 mg/ml). Turquoise Blue was the only dye that exhibited any level of decolorization without using ABTS. The Leptosphaerulina sp. lyophilized-extracts (Fig.  4) 
decolorized enzymatically all the dyes. In Remazol Black, Page 8 of 14 Plácido et al. Bioresour. Bioprocess.  (2016) 3:6 
the enzymatic decolorization was approximately 70  %. 
Leptosphaerulina sp. enzymatic extract transformed the reaction media color, from a deep black into a reddish color. Leptosphaerulina sp. enzymatic extracts achieved 
similar levels of decolorization than the commercial enzyme (80 %). In Turquoise Blue, the Leptosphaerulina 
sp. enzymatic extracts produced a decolorization of 56 % (Fig.  4). In Turquoise Blue, the decolorization difference

Real textile effluents treatment using Leptosphaerulina sp.
The final discharge effluent had the following character -
istics: alkaline pH (12), greyish color, low dyes concen -
tration, and the presence of suspended particles. The effluent spectrophotometric analysis showed two strong signals at 520 and 680 nm. These signals were employed to calculate the effluent decolorization percentage. The decolorizing effect of Leptosphaerulina sp. was evaluated using a factorial design 2  × 2 × 2. The experiment’s fac
-
tors were: medium supplementation (10  g/L of glucose and 5  g/L of ammonium tartrate), pH (as received and pH 5) and inoculum (4 and 8 cylinders). After 21  days, the treatments with low pH achieved a decolorization above 70  %, whereas, the treatments with the original pH produced removals below 30 % (Fig.  5a). The experi
-
ment’s statistical analysis evidenced a lack of interac -
tion between the three factors (p value  >0.05). Thus, the best treatment selection was carried out by doing the Duncan’s test (see Additional file  1: Annex S1). The 
treatment pHm-Sup-8 achieved the best decolorization (95.5 %), followed by pHm-Sup-4 (71 %), pHm-woSup-4 (70  %), and pHm-woSup-8 (69  %). The treatments that produced the largest decolorization also showed laccase production. pHm-Sup-8 treatment achieved the greatest laccase production (24.86 U/L), followed by pHm-Sup-4 (5.27  U/L). The first and final days effluent’s spectrum evidenced the complete reduction of the signals observed at the beginning of the experiment (Fig. 5c).
The dyeing effluent was evaluated using a facto
-
rial design 2  ×  2 ×  2. In this effluent, the experiment’s factors were: medium supplementation (10 g/L of glucose and 5 g/L of ammonium tartrate), inoculum (4 or 8 cyl
-
inders), and dilution (as received and 200  ppm of dyes, the dye concentration was calculated based in Novacron Red’s original concentration). The effluent had three dyes: Novacron Red (6.8  g/L), Novacron Blue (6.75  g/L), and Novacron Yellow (5.94 g/L). The effluent had a basic pH (12), suspended particles and deep military green col
-
oration. The spectrophotometric analysis revealed two strong signals at 415 and 608 nm (Fig.  5d); these signals 
were used to calculate the decolorization percentage. Leptosphaerulina sp. only decolorized the effluent when it was diluted to 200  ppm (Fig.  5b), the undiluted sam
-
ples did not show decolorization. The largest removal was obtained by Dil-Sup-8 (90  %), the other diluted treatments decolorized the effluent below 50  %. Dil-Sup-8 exhibited a considerable reduction in the signal at 415 nm (Fig.  5d). The absorbance reduction in this peak 
can be related with the production of laccases. In fact, Dil-Sup-8 presented the most significant laccase produc
-
tion (40 U/L). The absorbance reduction at 415 nm was observed in the treatment Dil-Sup-4, which also pro
-
duced laccase activity (10  U/L). The statistical analysis evidenced an interaction between the inoculum quantity and the medium supplementation (see Additional file  1: 
Annex S1). The interactions plot described an inverse interaction between the factors. Additionally, the interac
-
tion plot confirmed the treatment Dil-Sup-8 as the best conditions to decolorize the dyeing effluent by Lepto
-
sphaerulina sp.
Decolorization products evaluation
The decolorized media (dyes and effluents) were lyo -
philized; then, the compounds in the lyophilized were extracted using four solvents (methanol, acetonitrile, ethyl acetate, and hexane). After that, the thin layer chro
-
matography (TLC) was performed. The extracts were spotted and run it using the same solvent as mobile phase. The hexane extracts did not produce any type of signals under UV light (near and far) and visible light. By contrast, the methanol, acetonitrile and ethyl acetate extracts revealed signals under UV and visible lights (Table  4). The chromatograms of the three dyes and the 
effluents exhibited the disappearance of the signals cor

responding to the dyes were present in dissolution and effluents (Rf 1). Additionally, the methanol, acetoni
-
trile and ethyl acetate extracts showed a large number of signals. These signals were not observed in the con
-
trols (Kirk’s media with and without dye). Turquoise Blue extracts generated a number of signals greater than Remazol Black and Novacron Red extracts. The use of TLC to evaluate the fungal or enzymatic degradation of dye have been reported in the enzymatic decolorization

Discussion
From 92 fungi isolated from different ecosystems, the selection process performed in this paper indicated that Leptosphaerulina sp. is the fungal strain with the best decolorizing activity among the fungal strains isolated. At this moment, this is the first report demonstrating the decolorizing activity in the genre Leptosphaerulina. The ability of Leptosphaerulina sp. to decolorize solutions with dyes can be related to the presence of ligninolytic

enzymes. Likewise, L. chartarum  and L. briosiana have 
been described as ligninolytic enzymes producers (Simon 
et al. 1979; Sajben-Nagy et al. 2014).
The decolorizing activity observed by Leptosphaer -
ulina  sp. in remazol black was similar to Bjerkandera 
adusta, Trametes versicolor, Funalia trogii and Irpex Lacteus, strains recognized by their high decolorizing activity over Remazol Black (Mohorčič et  al. 2006; Park et al. 2007; Máximo and Costa-Ferreira 2004). Similarly, 
Leptosphaerulina sp. decolorization percentage (>90  %) can be compared with the decolorization obtained by P. simplicissimum  INCQS40211, P. chrysosporium,  and Ph. 
Tremellosa over Turquoise Blue. In these fungal strains, 
the removal was above 94 % (Kirby et al. 2000; Bergsten-
Torralba et al. 2009). Similarly, novacron red was decol
-
orized by Leptosphaerulina sp. in a greater level than the reported by other fungal strains at similar or greater concentrations (≥200  ppm) of monoazoic dyes (Jarosz-Wilkołazka et al. 2002).
In terms of decolorization time, Leptosphaerulina sp. 
decolorized remazol black in times comparable with Funalia trogii (3 days); however, F. Trogii had a dye con
-
centration (100  ppm) lower than Leptosphaerulina sp. (200  ppm) (Park et  al. 2007). In other fungal strains, Remazol black decolorization was realized between 10 and 15  days and with a dye concentration lower than the used in this investigation (Mohorčič et al. 2006; Park et  al. 2007). Turquoise Blue decolorization exhibited a 
high decolorization time (3  days) (Fig.  3b). However, in 
this dye, the initial removal was performed by an adsorp
-
tion process. The Turquoise Blue high adsorption can be related to the copper molecule in the core of the dye Table 4 Thin layer chromatography results of the lyophilized extracts obtained after the decolorization process

structure. The adsorption of copper-related dyes has been 
observed in other fungal strains, as P. simplicissimum  
and Penicillium oxalicum (Bergsten-Torralba et al. 2009; 
Xin et al. 2010). In contrast, novacron red was decolor -
ized in less days (9  days, 90  %); however, this period is considered as a fast decolorization for monoazoic dyes. Other fungal strains decolorized monoazoic dyes at the same concentration, during a time between 12–20  days (Swamy and Ramsay 1999; Toh et al. 2003). Faster decol
-
orizations have been reported; nevertheless, these decol -
orizations used concentrations (80–100  ppm) less than this study (200 ppm) (Swamy and Ramsay 1999). Similar to turquoise blue, Novacron Red decolorization by Lepto
-
sphaerulina sp. exhibited two decolorization mecha -
nisms, adsorption and enzymatic catalysis. Adsorption was the predominant mechanism during the 1st days; however, after the 3rd day, the principal mechanism was the enzymatic catalysis. The combination of these two removal mechanisms has also been described in I. lacteus and Penicillium simplicissimum  in the decolorization of 
reactive red 198 and methyl red (Novotný et  al. 2004; Bergsten-Torralba et al. 2009).
Leptosphaerulina sp. produced laccase and MnP to 
decolorize the three dyes, LiP was not observed in the cultures. It is important to remark that these enzymes were produced during all the culture; however, they reached their maximum production at different times. In remazol black, the largest enzyme production of laccase (650  U/L) and MnP(100  U/L) by Leptosphaerulina sp. was observed at day 15. Ligninolytic microorganisms that decolorize solutions with Remazol Black can be grouped in two sets, high laccase producers and high MnP pro
-
ducers. Leptosphaerulina sp. belongs to high laccase 
producers. The largest laccase activity exhibited by Lepto -
sphaerulina sp. (650  U/L) is comparable with T. versi -
color (577 U/L) and C. dryhophyla (335  U/L) (Baldrian and Šnajdr 2006). The MnP activity is also comparable with those species; however, the MnP activity in Lepto
-
sphaerulina sp. was small compared with other micro -
organisms, such as F. trogii (559 U/L) or Geotrichum  sp. 
(300 U/L) (Máximo et al. 2003; Kariminiaae-Hamedaani et  al. 2007). In turquoise blue experiment, the largest 
enzymatic production was observed at day 9 with a lac
-
case activity of 512 U/L and a MnP activity of 100 U/L. The laccase activity dominance, in the treatment of phthalocyanine dyes, has been described in other fun
-
gal strains, such as Gloeophyllum odoratum (104  U/L), Trametes pubescens (391  U/L) and F. trogii (400  U/L) (Anastasi et al. 2010; Yesilada et al. 2010). The enzymatic 
production was observed during all the kinetic; never
-
theless, the highest enzymatic activities of laccase and MnP were observed on day 13 with 647 U/L and 90 U/L, respectively. In the degradation of monoazoic dyes is not common to see a laccase production greater than MnP . Monoazoic dyes have been decolorized by fungal strains (T. versicolor ATCC 20869, T. versicolor CNPR 8107, 
and I. lacteus) with greater MnP activities than laccase 
(Novotný et al. 2004; Toh et al. 2003).
The positive results obtained by Leptosphaerulina 
sp. and the differences obtained between the dyes are explained by the differences in the biochemistry of the decolorization process. The azoic dyes, Remazol black and Novacron red, are degraded principally by an enzy
-
matic process (Michniewicz et al. 2008); whereas, phth -
alocyanine dyes (Turquoise Blue) are degraded by a mixture of biophysical and biochemical process. In this case, Turquoise Blue is initially absorbed by the cell wall and after that degraded by the ligninolytic enzymes (Swamy and Ramsay 1999; Kirby et al. 2000). Both types of degradation have a different physiological explanation. In the azoic dyes case, the chemical structure of azoic dyes is related with the presence of phenol groups. Phe
-
nol groups are the principal substrate for the ligninolytic enzymes; therefore, the enzymatic enzymes degrade the dye by using the structural similarity between azoic dyes and lignin (Kokol et al. 2007). On the other hand, phth
-
alocyanine dyes are adsorbed in the membrane because they have a copper atom in their structure, copper atoms tend to be absorbed by ligninolytic fungus to further include them in the structure of their enzymes, in this case the dye molecule is absorbed and further degraded by the enzymatic enzymes (Jarosz-Wilkołazka et  al. 2002).
The Leptosphaerulina sp. lyophilized-extracts (Fig.  4) 
transformed enzymatically all the dyes; however, this decolorization was dependent of the dye. Leptosphaer
-
ulina  sp. enzymatic extracts achieved similar levels 
of remazol black decolorization than the commercial enzyme (80 %); however, this decolorization was less than the obtained by enzymatic extracts from Pleurotus sajor-caju  and Ganoderma lucidum, using HBT as mediator 
(Murugesan et  al. 2007). The enzymatic extracts trans
-
formed the remazol red into a reddish colour, this red -
dish coloration was described in the decolorization of Remazol Black by enzymatic extracts from Pleurotus sajor-caju  and Ganoderma lucidum using N,N’-Bis-(1H-
tetrazol-5-yl)-hydrazine (HBT) as mediator (Murugesan et al. 2007). In Turquoise Blue, the Leptosphaerulina sp. 
enzymatic extracts produced a decolorization of 56  % (Fig.  4). This enzymatic decolorization is similar to the 
obtained by extracts of Dichomitus squalens (60 %) over 
the copper (II) phthalocyanine dye (Svobodová et  al. 2008). The low decolorization of monoazoic dyes by enzymatic extracts has been reported in acid yellow 49 and acid yellow 129 (Ciullini et  al. 2008). In the future, the decolorization using Leptosphaerulina sp. enzymatic Page 13 of 14

extracts can be improved by incrementing the MnP activ -
ity in the extracts and employing other types of chemical 
mediators, as HBT or vanillin.
Leptosphaerulina sp. displayed high decolorizing activ -
ity in the discharge and dyeing bath effluent (>90  %). This level of decolorization was achieved by the optimi
-
zation of different factors. The principal ones were pH and effluent concentration. The importance of neutral or acid pH to realize the decolorization has been observed in P. sajor-caju , B. adusta, and I. lacteus (Mohorčič et al. 
2006; Novotný et al. 2011). The dye concentration in the effluent was 50 times larger than the dye concentration tested in the previous experiments. Leptosphaerulina sp. was inhibited by the large dye concentration; however, at lower concentrations, Leptosphaerulina sp. decolorized efficiently the dyeing effluent. Effluent dilution reduces 
the growth and enzymatic production inhibitions 
(Mohorčič et  al. 2006). Other factors such as nitrogen 
and glucose supplementation and initial inoculum also affected the decolorization process; however, they were less relevant than pH and effluent concentration. Glucose supplementation has been proved as an important factor in order to bio-remediate textile effluents with lignino
-
lytic fungi (Novotný et al. 2011; Pakshirajan et al. 2011). In contrast, nitrogen supplementation had contradictory effects. Aspergillus fumigatus XC6 (Jin et  al. 2007) and 
Phanerochaete chrysosporium (Pakshirajan et  al. 2011) exhibited large decolorization, when nitrogen was sup
-
plemented; whereas, C. versicolor showed less decoloriza -
tion after nitrogen supplementation (Asgher et al. 2009).
Conclusions
From 92 Colombian fungal isolates, Leptosphaerulina sp. 
exhibited the best decolorization percentage (>90  %) in solid and liquid cultures, and in agitated and un-agitated conditions. Additionally, Leptosphaerulina sp. decolorized two real effluents from textile industries (>90  %) under conditions of low pH and glucose/nitrogen supplementa
-
tion. These decolorizations were associated with the pro -
duction of significant quantities of laccase (650 U/L) and MnP (100  U/L). Leptosphaerulina sp. enzymatic extracts decolorized (20–80  %) the three dyes; however, they needed the presence of ABTS as mediator. The cytotoxic
-
ity test and the chromatographic techniques demonstrated the dyes’ biochemical transformation and the absence of negative effects in the compounds produced by this bio
-
chemical process. Leptosphaerulina sp. is an interesting microorganism for future biotechnological applications, specially to treat waters from the textile industry.
