Abstract  
J-Polyglutamic acid ( J-PGA) has been reported to be an effective biosorbent for metal ions.  In vitro  binding of lead (II) 
(
Pb) by J-PGA produced from B acillus subtilis  NBRC16449 was examined and t he effect of Pb and J-PGA on Bra ssica  
chinensis  L. grown in the laboratory  was investigated. The result s revealed that the optimal pH for Pb  adsorption was 5.0.  
J-PGA  was stable at 35 -50°C  and pH  5-7. The maximum removal  efficiency was 87.9%.  Brassica chinensis  L. seeds  were 
g
erminated and  grown at 28±1qC on filter paper soaked with Pb solution at 0, 50, 100 and 250 PM and J-PGA at 0, 100, 
500
 and 1,000 mg/L for 7  days. The results indicated that Pb markedly inhibited growth of  roots  by reducing root length 
(P<0.05). However; the addition of 500 mg/L J-PGA significantly protected seedlings from the adverse effects of Pb 
(P<0.05). Thus , J-PGA has high potential as a biopolymer to be used for alleviation of Pb  toxicities in plants .

pollutant that persists in the soil and is widespread in the urban envir onment. Although Pb is not an essential 
nutrient for plants, it is easily taken up by them from  the soil and accumulated in edible parts. Excess Pb in 
plants causes several toxicity symptoms associated wi th the retardation of growth, inhibition of root 
elongation, appearance of chlorosis and inhibition of enzyme activities  >1@. Vegetables (Brassicaceae) 
culti
vated in  land close to traffic roads and highways in Thailand contain Pb levels between 1.0  and 1.6 mg/ kg 
FW
 >2@ while the maximum permissible level of Pb in vegetables set by Codex Alimentarius (2001) is 0.3 
mg/kg FW >3@. Thus , the consumption of edible plant parts might cause adverse health effects in human s. 
Recent
ly, microbial cells and biopolymers derived from microorganisms have been emerging as an alternative 
treatment for scavenging heavy metals from soil and aqueous systems. J-Polyglutamic acid ( J-PGA) is a 
n
aturally occurring anionic polymer, an d is biodegradable, ed ible and nontoxic to humans and is benign to the 
environment. PGA consists of D - and L -isomers of glutamic acid linked by amide bonds between the α -amino 
an
d carboxyl group s >4@.  In the past few years, there has been  interest in various applications of J-PGA in 
th
ickeners, humectants, drug carriers, biological adhesi ves, foods, cosmetics, medicines, water absorbents, 
bioflocculants and wastewater treatment >4@. Moreover, it has been reported to  be an effective biosorbent for 
cation
ic dyes >5@ and several metal ions : Ni (II),  Cu(II), Mn(II), Al(III) and Cr(III)  >6@, Hg(II)  >7@ and Cd (II) 
>8@ in water treatment. Thus, it is o f interest to consider whether J-PGA can be used as a Cd biosorbent with  
plants and to reduce Pb toxicity in plants. This study investigated the optimal  condit ions for in vitro  Pb 
ad
sorption by J-PGA and the effect s of Pb and J-PGA on Brassica  chinensis L. seedlings grown in the 
lab
oratory.  
2. Experimental Method  
2.1. Production and purification of J-PGA  
J-PGA from Bacil lus subtilis  NBRC16449 was produced  in a PGA -production medium  and purified by the 
prescribed  method  >9@. 
2.2. In vitro Pb(II) binding experiments  
The reaction was  carried out by taking 50 m L of 500 PM of lead(II)  chloride (PbCl 2) (Sigma, USA) 
s
olution and adjusting to pH 5.0. Next, 10 ml of 1,000 mg/L J-PGA was added and the mixture was stirred at 
150
 rpm for 10 min at 37 qC.  T hen, sample s were taken at different time intervals  to determine the residual Pb 
co
ncentration (no further  absorption of Pb). Each sample solution was  filtered through 0.2 -Pm membrane 
f
ilter and the filtrate was  analysed for Pb  concentration by using a flam ato m ic absorption spectrophotometer 
(AAS)  (spectrAA 220 F.S.  model, Australia)  with an  oxidizing flame of an air -acetylene mixture at a ratio of 
7:1. 
The optimum pH for Pb  adsorption was  determined at pH 3 -7. For pH stability, J-PGA was kept  at pH 3 -
9 at 37°C for 2 h. Temperature stability was performed at  pH 7.0 at 30 -50°C for 2 h. Finally,  Pb adsorption  
was carried out at the optimal  condition s and the residual Pb concentration was analysed by AAS.   
2.3. Effect of J-PGA on lead uptake by Brassica chinensis  L. 
The healthy B. chinensis  L. seeds were surface sterili sed in 10% sodium hypochlorite for 10 min, then 
rin
sed four  times with deioni sed water.  The seeds were soaked in deioni sed water for 30 min. A filter paper 
w
as placed on a Petri dish (9 cm in diameter ) and moistened with 5 ml of the Pb and J-PGA mixture  in 
dif
ferent series of concentrations (Pb; 0, 50, 100, 250 μM and J-PGA; 0, 50, 100, 500, 1,000 mg/L). Ten seeds 
w
ere placed  on a Petri dish and incubated in a growth chamber with 12 h light and  12 h darkness at  28ºC±1ºC 271  O. Chunhachart et al.  /  APCBEE Procedia   10  ( 2014 )  269 – 274 
for 7 days. Three replications were conducted for  each treatment. Physical parameters of the rice seedling (the 
s
hoot and root lengths,  the fresh and dry weights, the percentage of germination and the vigo ur index) were 
deter
mined.   
2.4. Statistical analysis  
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software  for Windows with analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
wi
th Duncan's Multiple -Range Test  (DMRT)  at the 0.05 probability level .  
3. Results and Discussion  
In vitro  binding of Pb  by J-PGA revealed that the  Pb adsorption occurred at pH 5.0  (Fig. 1.) . J-PGA was 
stab
le at pH 7; however, the adsorption activity was more than 90% at pH 5 -6. While J-PGA was most stable 
at 30°C, the Pb adsorption  activity was more than 90% at 40 -50°C (Fig. 2.) . The maximum removal efficiency 
of
 Pb was 87.9%  (Table 1.) . Because J-PGA is an anionic polymer of glutamic acid , it has been used as a 
chelati
ng material as  it is capable of binding metal ions via its carboxylic and amide group s >10@. Furthermore, 
th
e metal ions may also interact with amide groups of J-PGA >6,10@. In previous studies, J-PGA  was effective 
in
 binding several metal ions >6,7,8@. In these studies the heavy metal ions were bound with J-PGA  using a 
si
milar chelation mechanism which was followed  by conformational change of the J -PGA  into an enveloped 
agg
regate precipitate >11@.

The effects of Pb and J-PGA on the percentage of germination of B. ch inensis  L. seedlings produced no 
sign
ificant differences among all treatments (Table 2.). However, Pb  significantly inhibited root length  growth. 
T
he inhibition of seedling growth is a common effect of  exposure to heavy metals which has also been found 273  O. Chunhachart et al.  /  APCBEE Procedia   10  ( 2014 )  269 – 274 
in Allum cepa  >12@ and Indian mustard ( Brassica  juncea  L.) >13@.  Lead reduces root growth and cause mitotic 
irregu
larities >12], [13@. 
The addition of Pb alone clearly  decreased the vigo ur index, while in contrast, the addition of J-PGA with 
n
o added Pb maintained  the vigo ur of seedlings  and the addition of 1,000 mg/L increased the vigour index for 
all lev
els of added Pb. The addition of J-PGA resulted in a noticeable increase in the root  length with more 
lateral roots co
mpared to the treatments without J-PGA.  However, the fresh and dry weights were not 
sign
ificantly  different. Other studies reported that plants tr ansport f ree metal ions by diffusion along the 
concentration gradient with results of these studies suggesting that J-PGA became bound to Pb  and formed 
Pb-PGA complexes  which had difficulty in penetrating the cell wall s of the plant root s causing a reduction in 
th
e Pb uptake  >15], [16@. Furthermore, these studies considered  th at the concentration of soluble Pb  became 
v
ery low because of the formation of the Pb -PGA complexes  affecting lead influx or the transport rate by 
plan
tlet root s. 
4. Conclusions  
J-PGA is  an effective Pb  biosorbent. Furthermore, it is capable of alleviating  Pb phytotoxicity  in B rassica 
chinensis  L. seedling s. The effect of J-PGA on Brassica  chinensis  L. grown in Pb  contaminated soil will be 
in
vestigated further.
