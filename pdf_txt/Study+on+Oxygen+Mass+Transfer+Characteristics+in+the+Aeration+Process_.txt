Introduction
Eutrophication waters are becoming a serious 
problem in many parts of the world. Several technologies such as sludge dredging [1], chemical coagulation [2], 
bioremediation [3], the addition of mulch [4-5], and artificial aeration [6] have been developed to control and mitigate eutrophication. Among them, artificial aeration is extensively used because of its advantages of simple operation, low cost, and quick effect. 
At present, the main artificial-aeration technologies 
are mechanical aeration, water-lifting aeration, and Pol. J. Environ. Stud. Vol. 30, No. 4 (2021), 3727-3739

Abstract
Microporous aeration is extensively used, and oxygen mass transfer during aeration has a 
direct impact on water remediation. Nevertheless, the research on the mechanism of oxygen 
mass transfer in microporous aeration is lacking. This study aimed to explore the variation in oxygen mass transfer from the bubble-movement flow-field in a microporous aeration system. Then, the characteristic parameters of oxygen mass transfer and bubble movement (by particle image velocimetry) were determined under different aeration rates. results showed 
that aeration rates were significantly positively correlated with bubble number (R = 0.98), 
bubble-movement velocity, total oxygen-mass-transfer coefficient ( K
La), and oxygenation 
capacity ( r2 = 0.98, 0.98). This finding indicated that the increase in bubble number and 
bubble-movement speed accelerated the oxygen mass transfer and improved oxygenation performance and K
La . Moreover, a significant positive correlation existed between aeration 
amount and average Sauter diameter (R>0.97), but a significant negative correlation existed between aeration amount and specific bubble surface area (R<-0.98). Thus, increased aeration amount led to increased average bubble Sauter diameter. These phenomena further led to decreased specific bubble surface area and E
A. Overall, these results can guide the research on 
oxygen-mass-transfer mechanism from the perspective of bubble-movement flow-field.

blast aeration. Mechanical aeration has the advantages 
of convenient operation and management, simple equipment structure, etc. however, it also has the 
disadvantages of high energy consumption, uneven gas production, and complicated maintenance. The installation and maintenance of water-lifting aeration equipment is also difficult and the energy consumption is large, so it is inconvenient for large-scale application. Meanwhile, blower-aeration system has the advantages of simple structure, low energy consumption, simple maintenance, low noise, and high oxygen-utilization rate [7]. In addition, micro-bubble aeration in an air-blast aeration system has advantages in water-quality repair. hu [8] found that aeration has a good inhibitory effect 
on the release of COD and N h
3-N after microporous 
aeration treatment of water from wuyu river in 
Beijing. Lu [9] explored the restoration effect of micro-nano aeration on urban landscape water bodies. Thus, microporous aeration [10, 11] is gradually becoming extensively used in artificial aeration technology due to its advantages of low energy consumption and high efficiency. The linear microporous hose aeration system as a micro-bubble aeration system has been well applied in the Tennessee Valley [12]. The oxygen-transfer efficiency of this technology can reach more than 90% in deep water [13]. however, with decreased water 
depth, the oxygen-utilization rate gradually decreases. when the water depth is 2-5 m, the oxygen-utilization 
rate is generally around 15% [14], which causes a large amount of energy waste and thus greatly limits the popularization and application of the linear microporous hose aeration. Therefore, the methods of improving the efficiency of gas-liquid-oxygen mass transfer are worth exploring. 
The theoretical description of oxygen mass transfer 
has been well described [15-17]. The oxygen mass transfer of microporous hose aeration is affected by many factors, such as pore diameter, aeration gas volume, and depth at which aeration occurs [18,19]. Other factors affecting oxygen mass transfer are flow pattern, shear stress, size of bubbles and their size distribution, and operational conditions [20,21], as well as bubble collisions and coalescence events as bubbles rise, and their velocity [22-27]. Nevertheless, most studies focus on external parameters such as aeration parameters and aeration mode, and the influence of bubble movement of microporous aeration on oxygen mass transfer is rarely studied. The bubble group produced by the microporous hose belongs to the bubble plume, and the gas-phase flow-field generated by the bubble plume during the rising process greatly influences the oxygen mass transfer. Many studies have been conducted on bubble plumes, for example, Simiano [28] conducted statistical analysis on the distribution and instantaneous diameter of the center of bubble plumes. Rensen [29] conducted an experimental study on the unstable structure of two-dimensional bubble plumes. Cheng [30] discussed the variation law of instantaneous and time-averaged velocity field distribution of bubble plume under different aspect ratios, voidage, and pressure in simulated aeration vessels. Based on particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurement technology and experimental research, Wang [31] determined the specific distribution of gas-phase velocity field in the aeration process through further numerical simulation. Xiao [32] studied the rule of bubble wall effect in the aeration process through experiments. Most of the above studies are based on hydraulics on the change rules of bubble plume flow-field and flow characteristics, and only a few have focused on the influence of bubble plume on oxygen mass transfer. Therefore, oxygen mass-transfer theory is necessary to study from the perspective of bubble-movement flow-field to better explore the microscopic mechanism of oxygen mass transfer. 
Indeed, the correlation between the movement 
rule of bubble plume and the law of oxygen transfer in a microporous aeration system needs to be further explored. accordingly, in the present study, 
linear microporous hose aeration was conducted to experimentally determine the bubble plume and oxygen-mass-transfer characteristics under different aeration rates. The correlation between plume-movement characteristics and oxygen transfer law was analyzed, and then the microscopic mechanism of oxygen transfer characteristics under different aeration rates was explained on the perspective of bubble-movement flow-field. Our results can provide a certain theoretical basis for improving aeration capacity and water quality, as well as reducing the operating cost of aeration systems.
Materials and Methods
Experimental Setup
The experimental equipment is schematically shown 
in Fig. 1. a transparent reactor tank (100 cm height × 
60 cm length × 45 cm width) is equipped with a rubber microporous aeration hose (length 50 cm) with a pore diameter of 200 µm ( wuxi aerating Equipment Co., 
Ltd., Jiangsu, China). The hose is fixed 5 cm above the bottom of the tank on a metal support, and the tank is filled with tap water of ambient temperature (water column height: 90 cm). Atmospheric air is pumped in using an oil-free air compressor at five different flow rates (150, 200, 250, 300, and 350 L/h) as determined by a gas-rotor flow meter. Airflow is regulated and controlled with a rotameter, and feed pressure is kept constant at 100 kPa by using a pressure gauge to avoid minor compressor fluctuations. During air flow, an LDY300 laser (pulse lasers) positioned above the center of the tank and directly above the aeration hose at a height of 30 cm above the water level directed light (460-510 nm) from above.

Dynamics A/S, Denmark). PIV measurements are taken in the vertical plane at a right angle to the orientation Influence of Aeration Rates on Oxygen Mass...

of the hose (Fig. 1) at a water depth of 40-85 cm (when 
the generated bubbles had ascended by at least 60 cm) over a width of 45 cm, giving an observation area of  
45 × 45 cm
2. The area of observation is about 0.2-2 mm
thick, as determined by the PIV equipment. This area is recorded with the PIV camera that sent images to an image-processing system in real time. Dissolved oxygen (DO) is measured simultaneously with the water temperature (accuracy 0.01ºC) by using a probe placed at a depth of 20 cm below the water surface and located exactly above the hose of a DO detector (PreSens, regensburg, Germany). 
Determination of Oxygen-Transfer Coefficient
Measurements were performed to monitor the 
degree of oxygenation and calculate the oxygen-utilization rate and the total oxygen-mass-transfer coefficient ( K
La; h-1 ). KLa was used to analyze the 
physical dynamic gassing-out method as described by Moutafchieva et al. [33]. First, anoxic water was created by flushing pure nitrogen through the water until the DO concentration dropped below 0.8 mg/L. when this 
state was reached, compressed air was injected through the hose. Furthermore, DO concentration and water temperature were recorded every 3 min until oxygen saturation was reached. For theoretical considerations, the classical dual-membrane theory originally proposed by using Lewis and whitman that describes a log-
deficit dependence (Eq. (1)).
           (1)
...where Cs [mg· m–3] is the DO saturation concentration, 
and Ct [mg· m–3] is the DO concentration in the tank at 
time t (in min). when plotting ln (Cs – Ct) against t, the 
slope of the curve gave KLa. To eliminate the influence 
of temperature, KLa was corrected to 20ºC by applying 
(Eq. (2)) [34]:         (2)
KLa is an important indicator of oxygen mass 
transfer, with basic equations as follows (Eq. (3)):

...where dC/dt [mg O2· m–3· h–1] is the oxygen-transfer 
rate, KL [m · h–1] is the molecular-mass-transfer 
coefficient of oxygen in a liquid film, A [m2] is the total 
surface area in the gas-liquid contact, and V [m3] is the 
volume of the liquid phase.
In addition, the formulas used to calculate the 
oxygenation capacity and oxygen-utilization rate are expressed by (Equation. (4) and (5)):
             (4)
               (5)
...where OC [mg· h–1] is the oxygenation capacity, 
C0 is the initial DO concentration, EA (%) is the oxygen-
utilization rate, N [mg· m–3] is the weight of oxygen in 
1 m3 air under standard conditions (with value 0.28), and 
Q [m3· h–1] is the aeration flow that was experimentally 
varied. For practical reasons, Q is expressed in L/h in 
the presented figures.
PIV Measurements and Image Processing
The CCD high-speed camera was focused on the 
center of the observation area described in section 2.1. To ensure a clear image of the flow-field, the laser light source was optimized for light intensity and uniformity before shooting. The optimum laser Fig. 1. Schematic of the experimental setup.

frequency had been determined as 7.4 hz in pilot 
experiments. The experiment was started by opening 
the air compressor and adjusting the pressure gauge as per readings of the rotameter. When the bubble flow was stable (stable bubble flow was generally achieved in 1 min, and considering accuracy, bubble-movement images were obtained after 6 min), the movement of the generated bubbles was observed in real time with images electronically stored at interval times of 0.2 s. 
This shooting frequency had been optimized from pilot experiments. Per experiment, a total of 25 images were recorded, covering a period of 5 s. Under this condition, the bubbles could rise at least 45 cm. 
raw images were processed before analysis to 
enhance the grayscale and image-edge segmentation. For the first, spatial gray transformation technology was used by applying the MATLAB software, which did not change the position of image pixels as it affected only the grayscale value of each pixel  
(Fig. 2). a histogram of the grayscales of pixels of each 
raw image was generated using the function IM hIST, 
which before adjustment ranged within 0-255 (Fig. 2b), but the vast majority of pixels were in a narrow range of 8-28 only. The corresponding image was mostly dark. Furthermore, bubbles were hardly visible (Fig. 2a). after extending the contrast, distribution uniformity 
increased (Fig. 2d). Finally, the bubbles were clearly visible (Fig. 2c).The second correction was based on threshold-
segmentation technology. The edge, defined as the region within an image where the grayscale changed most strongly, was identified using PREWITT to improve contrast in Fig. 3.
Calculation of Bubble Velocity
The velocity of bubble movement was calculated 
from the generated images based on a comparison of two images from two consecutive time points, as explained below. Given that the laser was used in dual mode, the instantaneous velocity of individual bubbles could also be calculated. accordingly, set of two images 
that were taken only a few milliseconds apart was produced for each time point. Depending on the gas flow (which was varied) this pulse interval time was varied between 6-10 ms, which ensured that the displacement that was sufficiently small to follow individual bubbles along their course and to calculate their instantaneous velocity. From the instantaneous velocity of multiple bubbles per time point, the velocity distribution of the flow-field per time point was obtained. 
The average velocity was obtained by dividing the 
observed displacement of the bubbles between two consecutive images for two time intervals. The signals of two consecutive frames (two time points) had to be matched to one and the same bubble, which was enabled

by cross-correlation using the adaptive Correlation 
module of the PIV software. Due to the large image 
area captured by the camera, each image was divided into a grid of 64 × 64 query windows (one window 
covered approximately 70 × 70 mm) to ensure bubbles 
did not move by more than half of a grid unit.
after obtaining the bubble-displacement positions, 
their velocity w was calculated using Eq. (6):
               (6)
...where Sx [mm] and Sy [mm] are the particle 
displacements in the x and y directions, respectively; k is 
the actual length of a unit pixel; dt [s] is the time interval 
between two time points; u(x, y) [m/s] is the velocity in 
the x direction; and v(x, y) [m/s] is the velocity in the 
y direction. The calculated bubble velocity w is given 
by the vector sum of velocities u and v, and w was 
visualized in a heatmap using TECPLOT software. 
Calculation of Bubble Size and Surface Area
The Shadow module in the PIV software was 
used to determine the diameter of bubbles. Individual bubbles were identified from the images as described above and counted per grid unit by using the bubble-size distribution law [35]. Most bubbles had an oval shape with a shorter axis in their direction of upwards travel. after determining the diameter of their short 
axis h
i and their long axis li, the equivalent diameter ( dbi) 
was calculated using Eq. (7) which gave the diameter of bubbles that were spherical [36].
                     (7)
The surface area SA of the bubbles was calculated 
with SA = 4π(dbi/2)2. ST represents the total surface area of a bubble to a large extent, and it represents a in 
equation (3). The volume of bubble V = 4 π(dbi/2)3/3. The 
specific surface area of bubble Sb = SA/V.
Geometric mean diameter (Sauter) dbs was adopted 
to characterize the mean diameter of such bubbles, as shown in the following formula:

Results and Discussion
analysis of Oxygen Mass Transfer 
Influence of Atmospheric Reoxygenation
The experimental device was a tank without cover, 
considering that the aeration oxygenation experiment was disturbed by external atmospheric reoxygenation, the influence of atmospheric reoxygenation on aeration was first explored through a pre-experiment before the formal experiment. Clean water was added to the water tank to a specified height, and nitrogen was filled to deoxidize the water body. after the DO was reduced 
to zero and stabilized, the portable oxygen dissolved meter was placed at the same position as the subsequent oxygen-mass-transfer experiment. The change trend of the DO over time was then measured, and results are shown in Fig. 4.
Fig. 4 shows that under the condition of atmospheric 
reoxygenation only, the concentration of DO showed a slow growth in the early stage (in the first 3 days, the concentration of DO increased from 0 mg/L to 
0.5 mg/L), and the growth rate in the later stage 
increased significantly. This trend was basically consistent with previous conclusions [37]. The difference was that the DO in the current work rose more slowly in the early stage, which was probably due to the relatively deeper DO probe in this experiment. Combined with

the aeration oxygen-mass-transfer experiment described 
later in this paper, DO can be known to reach saturation in a very short time (combined with Fig. 5, saturation can be known to be reached within 60-100 min). The influence of atmospheric reoxygenation on the subsequent aeration oxygen-mass-transfer experiment can be ignored. 
Influence of Aeration on the Characteristics 
of Oxygen Mass Transfer 
Oxygen mass transfer was determined by 
experiments based on the measured DO values, which were used to calculate K
La. Fig. 5a) shows that 
increased aeration rate accelerated the rate of rise of DO concentration. when DO concentration reached 
6 mg/L, the times required under different aeration 
rates (from 150 L/h to 350 L/h) were 33.19, 25.19, 20.07, 
16.26, and 12.77 min, respectively.
By plotting these data on a log scale (Fig. 5b), K
La 
could be calculated for each airflow. To improve the accuracy of experimental data, the first two records and the second two records were omitted, and the relationship between ln(C
s – Ct) and time T is shown in 
Fig. 5b). The trend line equations of 150 L/h to 350 L/h 
are as follows: y = -3.7526x + 2.9027, y = -5.0862x  
+ 2.9829, y = -6.3918x + 3.0624, y = -7.6x + 2.9449, 
y = -8.1577x + 2.7198. The KLa varied from 3.75 h-1 
(at 150 L/h) to 8.16 h-1 at 350 L/h before correction 
of temperature, and the normalized KLa(20) ranged 
from 3,70 h-1 to 7.99 h-1 (Table 1) after correction 
for the actual temperature ( KLa(20) (h-1) = KLa(20) 
(h-1) ×1. 024(20- T). The oxygenation capacity ( OC) and 
oxygen-utilization rate ( EA) can be obtained from the 
above formulas (4) and (5), respectively. This finding corresponded to an OC in the range of 6.92 g O
2 h-1 
to 14.94 g O2 h-1. Meanwhile, with increased aeration, 
Ea showed an initial increase (from 15.24% at 150 L/h 
to 16.80% at 250 L/h), and then it decreased rapidly to 
15.24% at 350 L/h (Table 1 ). In summary, increasing the 
aeration amount can improve the oxygen mass-transfer efficiency and oxygen filling capacity in absolute value. It is the most efficient when the oxygen-utilization rate was the highest, i.e., 250 L/h, from the point of view of energy consumption. 
Overall, aeration has positive and negative effects on 
gas-liquid-oxygen mass transfer. The positive effect can be explained as follows. First, the gas holdup increased with increased aeration amount [38], which increased the total gas-liquid contact area and induced K
La and 
OC to increase. Second, when the aeration volume increased, the bubble movement enhanced the water-mixing effect and intensified the turbulence degree, which improved the oxygen-mass-transfer coefficient in two aspects: 1) reduction in thickness of the liquid film and weakening of mass-transfer resistance; and 2) the water body around the bubble was updated quickly, which was conducive to maintaining a large oxygen deficit. The negative effects were usually reflected as the aeration volume increased in two aspects. On one hand, the bubble diameter increased, and the specific surface area decreased; on the other hand, the bubble-movement speed increased and the residence time shortened, which was not conducive to the oxygen mass Fig. 4. Trend diagram of DO over time under atmospheric reoxygenation.

transfer [39, 40]. On the whole, the positive effect of 
gas volume increase was dominant, which induced KLa 
and OC to increase, and KLa and OC were positively 
correlated with aeration (the correlation coefficient r
2 were 0.98 and 0.98, respectively) (Fig. 6(a,b)). 
Obviously, KLa and OC were related to the difference 
in plume-motion parameters generated by aeration, so the bubble flow-field distribution characteristics require further study. 
The influence of aeration amount on E
A is primarily 
reflected by the gradual decrease in EA when aeration 
amount increases [41]. when the ventilation is small, the 
bubble diameter is small, the specific surface area of the bubble is relatively large, the bubble-movement speed is small, the retention time in the water is long, more oxygen is transferred to the water per unit air volume, and E
A is high; the opposite trends are true when EA 
is low. In the present study, EA initially increased and 
then decreased with increased aeration because the aerator used in the experiment was an elastic rubber hose, and fine holes were evenly distributed on the hose wall, when the inlet pressure was greater than the requirements of opening pressure, microbubbles formed after the holes were opened; conversely, when the inlet pressure was lower than the opening pressure, the hole closed automatically. according to the change rule of 
E
A (Fig. 6c), due to insufficient air pressure, the pores 
on the aeration hose were not fully opened, and many bubbles did not enter the water body. Moreover, no gas-liquid mass transfer occurred when the aeration rate was 150 L/h or 200 L/h. when the aeration amount was 
more than 250 L/h, the pores were completely open, 
so E
A decreased with increased aeration amount. In 
practice, when this material was used for aeration, the aeration amount at the highest oxygen-utilization rate should be considered because the energy consumption rate was the lowest.
The above content qualitatively revealed the 
influence mechanism of gas holdup and bubble movement on the change trend of K
La, OC, and EA 
with increased aeration amount. Nevertheless, few quantitative studies have focused on the change in aeration amount affects the characteristic parameters of bubble-movement flow-field. The succeeding parts of this paper focus on the change characteristics of the bubble-movement flow-field with increased aeration amount.Q(L/h) T(ºC) Cs(mg/L) KLa(h–1) KLa(20)(h–1) OC(g O2 h–1) EA(%)

Influence of Aeration on the Gas Phase 
Vector Velocity Field
Influence of Aeration on the Gas Phase Velocity 
when the system had been stabilized, the shape 
of the bubble plume did not vary over time (data not 
shown). Fig. 7 shows the cloud map of average velocity of plume under different aeration rates. At an airflow of 150 L/h, the gas phase velocity was primarily located in the middle area of the aerator section and the velocity was generally low, with most of them concentrated in 0.2-0.25 m/s. with increased aeration 
volume to 250 L/h, the bubble plume range widened, showing the maximum velocity in the middle region, and a large number of bubbles had velocities between 0.35-0.4 m/s. when the aeration amount reached  
350 L/h, the plume range continued to diffuse, the overall gas-phase velocity also increased accordingly, with a large number of bubbles reaching about  
0.45 m/s. The figure above can be summarized as follows. 1) Under each aeration amount, the high-bubble-velocity area was primarily concentrated in the middle area, and a larger aeration amount meant a higher proportion of the high-bubble-velocity area.  
2) Bubble velocity decreased in gradient from the center to both sides, and the gradient difference increased from 0.2 m/s to about 0.4 m/s when 150 L/h to  
350 L/s with increased aeration quantity. with increased air, the width of the bubble plume obviously increased, transverse impact amplitude rose from around  
100 mm at 150 L/h to about 300 mm at 350 L/h, and bubble turbulence degree increased. These phenomena benefited the gas and liquid two-phase mixture and improved the system’s oxygen-filling capacity and oxygen-mass-transfer effect, further explaining the microscopic distribution of oxygen-mass-transfer characteristics. 
Influence of Aeration on the Gas phase Velocity Vector 
and Flow Pattern 
The vector heatmap in Fig. 7 shows the speed 
of bubbles in a given position, but their direction of movement is not shown. This direction can be visualized in the velocity-trajectory diagram of bubble movement (Fig. 8a). Fig. 8b) is the flow diagram of different aeration quantities extracted with TECPLOT software. as shown in Fig. 8a), when the aeration amount was 150 
L/h, the main influence range of the bubble plume was X = 180 – 300 mm. Bubble dispersion occurred when the 
Y direction was higher than 250 mm, but the influence 
range remained limited. Meanwhile, Figs 8a) and 8b) show that the unaffected liquid phase on both sides of the bubble plume was at rest. when the aeration volume 
was 200 L/h, the influence range of bubble movement on the liquid phase increased, the left area showed a certain streamline trajectory, and the right part of the

area still showed no plume. This finding can be seen 
in Fig. 8b) and Fig. 7 above. The movement track of bubble plume was primarily distributed in the region of X = 150 – 350 mm at 250 L/h; at this time, the bubble 
plume began to form a hydraulic circulation in the left part. Fig. 8b) also indicate that the hydraulic circulation increased the degree of turbulence, promoting  the gas-liquid two-phase exchange. when the aeration 
rate was 300 L/h, the movement track of bubble plume was primarily distributed in the region of  
X = 100 – 350 mm, the water flow on both sides had 
been completely affected, and the hydraulic circulation gradually occurred on both sides, especially on the right side. The above phenomenon became more obvious

and the movement track of bubble plume widened 
when the aeration amount reached 350 L/h, which fully affected the liquid on both sides and facilitated very obvious hydraulic circulation on both sides. These phenomena can also be clearly seen in Fig. 8b).
Combined with the cloud map of bubble-movement 
velocity, the increase in aeration volume led to the following. 1) The average bubble velocity gradually increased. Most bubbles were at (0.2-0.25) m/s at  
150 L/h and increased to 250 L/h, but a large number of bubbles were at 0.35-0.4 m/s. Then, at 350 L/h, most 
bubbles were around 0.45 m/s. Combined with the analysis of the change rules of oxygen-mass-transfer experiment, it can be summarized as follows. On one hand, the increase in bubble-movement speed enhanced the degree of water turbulence, reduced the thickness of liquid film, accelerated the regeneration of water around bubbles, and induced bubble formation, rise, and breakage at a faster speed, thereby strengthening the oxygen mass transfer. On the other hand, the increase of bubble-movement speed can shorten retention time, which reduced the time of gas–liquid mass transfer and was not conducive to the oxygen mass transfer. Notably, the fact that bubble residence time influenced the oxygen mass transfer, which involved the time needed by the gas–liquid mass transfer, deserves further study. at present, in-depth research on this issue is lacking. 2) 
with increased aeration from 150 L/h to 350 L/h, the 
bubble-velocity gradient (from the center to both sides of the edge) increased from 0.2 m/s to about 0.4 m/s, which promoted the exchange between bubbles and water and increased the relative velocity between bubbles and water flow. The corresponding calculation 
formula of K
La was  [42], where Vr is 
the relative velocity between bubbles and water flow, as 
can be seen above, which increase improves KLa. 3) 
with increased aeration, hydraulic circulation gradually 
occurred on both sides of bubble plume [43,44], which was very significant at 350 L/h. This phenomenon induced the bubble to produce strong wall-attachment effect, and the bubble aggregation collision intensified at the side wall of the aeration pool, which benefited the prolonging of bubble residence time and improvement in turbulent degree of the liquid phase. Ultimately, these phenomena aided gas-liquid two-phase mixing, improved the system’s OC and K
La, and further 
explained the microscopic effect of oxygen-mass-transfer distribution characteristics. 
Influence of Aeration on Characteristic Parameters 
of Bubble Plume
Fig. 9 shows that the number of bubbles in the same 
field increased with increased aeration amount and was significantly positively correlated with the number of bubbles (R>0.98). The linear fitting equation was N = 18.61Q-519.3. With increased aeration amount from 
150 L/h to 350 L/h, the number of bubbles increased by 238.69%, and the total surface area increased from 11 004.84 mm
2 to 37 299.37 mm2 (Table 2). however, 
according to formulas (3) and (4), which improved OC 
and KLa, their variations were affected by many factors 
(e.g., bubble size, velocity, specific surface area, and other parameters), so further discussion is needed. Figs 9(b-d) show the variation in average Sauter diameter, specific surface area ( S
b), and proportion of bubble 
diameter under different aeration amounts Q(L/h).
Fig. 9b) shows that with increased aeration amount 
from 150 L/h to 350 L/h, the average bubble Sauter diameter increased from 1.48 to 1.77 (Table 2). A significant positive correlation existed between aeration and average Sauter diameter (R>0.97), and the linear fitting equation was dbs = 0.00154Q + 1.225. Due 
to the increase in aeration amount, a greater number of bubbles within the flow-field corresponded to a greater contact probability among bubbles, and larger bubbles were more likely to form with the collision and polymerization between them. Fig. 9c) shows the percentage of number of bubbles in each diameter range. Statistical analysis of the captured bubble diameter in the study area showed the following. 1) at each aeration 
rate, the diameter of bubbles greater than 80% was less than 2.0 mm. 2) when bubble diameter ranged 
within 0-1.0 mm, bubble proportion was the highest at  
150 L/h, and the bubble proportion gradually decreased with increased aeration amount. 3) when the bubble 
diameter ranged within 1.0-2.0 mm, bubble proportion 
was the lowest at 150 L/h, and bubble proportion gradually increased with increased aeration amount. In the subsequent 2.0-3.0 mm, the change trend remained.

the bubble proportion decreased to a very low level 
without significant difference in each aeration volume, indicating that bubble diameter tended to increase with increased aeration amount, and the number of bubbles greater than 3.0 mm was very small. Fig. 9d) shows the 
change rule of specific surface area of bubbles under different aeration amounts, i.e., gas–liquid contact area per unit volume within the region. The figure shows that the specific surface area of the bubble decreased from 3.9 to 3.24, with a decrease of 20.37% with increased aeration amount from 150 L/h to 350 L/h (Table 2). a 
significant negative correlation existed between aeration and specific surface area of bubbles (R<-0.98), and the linear fitting equation was Sb = -0.0034Q + 4.442, meaning that the gas-liquid contact area per unit volume decreased with increased aeration. This finding was not conducive to the process of oxygen mass transfer, and to a large extent revealed the reason why E
a decreased 
with increased aeration.
analysis of the variation law of oxygen mass 
transfer on the angle of flow-field characteristic parameters was conducted by Dong Liang [45]. They applied PIV technology to obtain a liquid velocity-vector diagram, flow diagram, and vorticity diagram and then analyzed flow-field motion to explain oxygen mass transfer. however, no combination of oxygen-
mass-transfer experiment and no quantitative analysis of bubble-movement characteristic parameters were used. Liu Xiao fang [46] measured parameters such as the diameter of microbubbles generated by the jet aerator by setting up a PIV test bench to explain oxygen mass transfer. however, they analyzed only 
the bubble size and did not combine it with oxygen-mass-transfer experiments. In the present experiment, PIV technology was used to obtain the number of bubbles, average diameter of bubbles (Sauter), specific surface area of bubbles, and velocity field of bubbles. In quantitative terms, the results were as follows.  
1) the bubble number (R>0.98) and the bubble-movement speed ((0.2-0.25) m/s at 150 L/h to 0.45 m/s at 350 L/h) were significantly positively correlated with increased aeration. Combined with the aforementioned, aeration flow was positively correlated with K
La (r2 = 0.98) 
and OC ( r2 = 0.98), showing that increased bubble 
number and bubble-movement velocity accelerated the oxygen mass transfer and improved the performance

of oxygen and KLa. 2) A significant positive correlation 
existed between aeration and average Sauter diameter 
(R > 0.97), and a significant negative correlation existed 
between aeration and specific bubble surface area (R < -0.98). The increase in aeration led to an increase 
in average bubble Sauter diameter, which reduced specific bubble surface area and E
a. 3) The increase of 
bubble diameter and bubble-movement velocity leads to the decrease of residence time in water, which may have lead to the decrease of oxygen mass transfer. The fact that the residence time of bubbles in the water affected the oxygen mass transfer may be related to the time needed for the oxygen mass transfer, which needs further research. In addition, some scholars have mentioned that the local dynamic characteristics of K
La 
[27] may be related to the characteristic parameters of bubble movement at each spatial position, and the functional relationship between K
La and each spatial 
position should be established. Thus, the author can see the deficiency of the research from this literature, that is, the research on oxygen-mass-transfer experiment and bubble-movement parameters should study the average value and the dynamics of K
La. Nevertheless, 
in the present study, given the different aeration flows, the difference in the average value of characteristic parameters of bubble movement can still reflect the change mechanism of oxygen mass transfer to some extent.
Conclusions 
The characteristic parameters of oxygen mass 
transfer and bubble-movement flow-field were investigated at different aeration rates to explain the characteristic parameters of oxygen mass transfer from the perspective of bubble-movement flow-field. The increase in bubble number (which can represent the gas holdup to some extent) and bubble velocity accelerated the oxygen mass transfer and improved the oxygenation performance and K
La. The increase in the 
average diameter of bubble Sauter reduced the bubble specific surface area and E
A. Future work should focus 
on determining whether the change in bubble residence time in water affects oxygen mass transfer. K
La should 
also be combined with the specific location of bubble-movement parameters. The study explains the influence of bubble-movement characteristics on oxygen mass transfer and provides theoretical reference for research on improving oxygen mass-transfer efficiency through microporous aeration and enhanced water-restoration effect.
