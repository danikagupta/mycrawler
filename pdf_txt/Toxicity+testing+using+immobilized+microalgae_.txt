 Abstract  
 
Applications of immobilized microalgae in 
environmental aquatic research have been recently 
increased. Current uses  of immobilized microalgae include 
removing of undesired substances (nutrients, metals and 
organic pollutants) from media,  culturing for metabolite 
productio n and culture collection handling.  Toxicity of 
substances and effluents can be measured  by n ovel 
immobilization techniques and the use of living microalgae 
as biosensors  in electronic devices designed , demonstrated 
to be a very promising topic . Recent research pointed out 
the advantages of mixed algal –bacterial  and co-immobilized 
systems in water treatment  plants. Appli cation of 
immobilized systems in the production of non -contaminant 
energy (as H ydrogen obtained from algal cultures) is also an  
important topic to be explored.  The future prospects of this 
area of algal immobilization are considered.

Introduction  
The use of microalgae in biotechnology has  been increased in recent years, these organisms being 
implicated  in food, cosmetic,  aquaculture and pharmaceutical  industries ( Borowitzka &  Borowitzka, 1988), but small  
size of single cells implies a problem in the application of  biotechnological  processes to those organisms. Cell 
immobilization  techniques have been developed in order to solve  those problems.  Although in the initial stage most of 
the research work on immobilization dealt with systems designed for the release of products, synthesized by 
enzymes or multi -enzyme complexes, a more recent development focuses on the immobilization of complete cells o r 
cell ag glomerates (Becker,  1995). An immobilized cell is defined as a cell that by natural or artificial means is 
prevented from moving independently of its neighbours to all parts of the aqueous phase of the system under study  
(Tampion &  Tampion, 1987).  Frequent  uses of immobilized algal cells are  the nutrients, metal and  organic pollutant 
removal from aquatic media, culturing for metabolite production, improvement of  culture collections handling, 
measurement of toxicity , obtaining of energy (via H ydrogen  or ele ctricity) and co-immobilization system production for 
different purposes.  
 
Removal of Nutrient s 
 
Immobilized algae have been investigated for their potential use for the uptake of nitrogen and phosphorus. 
The algal cells immobilized in carrageenan and alginate beads had the efficiency to remove nitrogen and phosphorus  
from wastewater  as the free suspended cells ( Tam & Wong, 2000).  Immobilized Scenedesmus  was found to be 
capable of removing 90% of the ammonium within four hours and 100% of phosphate within two hours from a typical 
effluen t (Chevalier & de la Noue, 1985 ), suggesting possible uses in the tertiary treatment of wastewaters. Travieso 
et al. (19 96) used immobilized Chlorella  vulgaris  for secondary wastewater treatment in a laboratory scale for 6 
months.Their conclusion was immobilized cells of Chlorella vulgaris  could be used for sewage treatment; the down -
flow fluidized column appears to be the better reactor for sewage treatment. Sawayama et al ., (1998) used 
Phormidium laminosum  immobilized on hollow fibres to remove nitrate and phosphate ions from water. Kobbai et al.,

 (2000) applied the immobilization technique for two green  fresh water microa lgae Scenedesmus obliquus  and 
Chlorella vulgaris  for wastewater treatment. They  reported 86 and 81% phosphorus removal and 100 and 98.4% 
ammonia removal in the two reactors after 7 days of treatment. Perez et al. , (2004) used immobilized Scenedesmus 
interm edius and Nannochloris sp . for phosphorus and nitrogen uptake from wastewater.  
   
Removal of Metal s 
Immobilized algal systems have been tested by many workers for their efficiency in heavy metals removal 
(Mallik, 2002) . Immobilization of biomass also provides protection to cells from metal toxicity (Bozeman et al., 1989).  
Size of immobilized bead is a crucial factor for use of immobilized biomass  in bio -sorption process (Mehta  and Gaur, 
2005). It is recommended that bea ds should be in the size range between 0.7 and 1.5 mm, corresponding to the size 
of commercial resins meant for r emoving metal ions (Volesky, 2001).  Significant uptake  of Co, Zn and Mn was also 
recorded for Chlorella salina cells immobilized in alginate (Garnham et al., 1992). Travieso et al. (2002) designed a 
bio-alga reactor, which consisted of a pilot scale model that was operated with synthetic wastewater with an initial 
concentration of 3000 μG/l of cobalt ion. Scenedesm us obliquus was immobilized in the reactor, which was operated 
in a batch mode. They recorded that the maximum removal of cobalt ion of 94.5% was reached after 10 days. The 
unicellular green microalga, Chlorella sorokiniana was immobilized on loofa  sponge  and successfully used as a new 
bio-sorption system for the removal of lead (II) ions from aqueous solutions  (Akhtar et al., 2004).  
   
Moreno -Garrido et al. (2005) used the marine microalga Tetraselmis chui , to perform a short term heavy 
metal accumulation  experiment. Beads of  calcium alginate containing the algal cells were exposed to 820 μG L-1 Cu 
and 870 μG L-1 Cd during a 24 h our period and reported that practically all Cu was removed by the beads.  Martinez 
et al . (2006) developed a method for mercury speciation in water using columns packed with Chlorella vulgaris 
immobilized on silica gel. This method was applied to the analys is of tap, sea and wastewater samples. Binding  of 
metals to algal surface occurs in liv ing and non -living algae (Greene and Bedell, 1990), cell surface area being a 
major parameter in the uptake of metals by microalgae (Khoshmanesh et al., 1997). Dead cells can be very efficient 
in accumulating metals ( Donmez et al., 1999).  In addition, non -living biomass can be immobilized in a granular or 
polymeric matrix and used in conventional ion exchange equipment (Volesky, 1990). The advantages of using 
inactive or dead biomass over ion exchange resins can include lower cost, improved selectivity for specific metal 
interest, easy regeneration and in some cases higher capacity ( Volesky, 1990 ). Packed -bed columns containing  
immobilized cells seem to be very efficient in the removal  of metals from aquatic media (Moreno -Garrido et al.,  2002) . 
Tan et al. (2002) investigated the bio -sorption of copper by inactivated biomass of the brown seaweed Sargassum 
baccularia , immobilized into polyvinyl alcohol gel beads.  Noble metals can also be accumulated by algae and 
selectively eluted from them (Guo et al. , 200 0). Gee and Dudeney (1987) described the adsorption of gold from a 
dissolved metal mixture by C. vulgaris and Spirulina  platensis  immobilized in Ca -alginate.  Kishore et al.,2006, carried 
out biosorption studies for removal of chromium using immobilized marine microalgae Isochrysis galbana  in Ca -
alginate.  
 
Removal of o rganic pollutants  
Aksu and Tezer (2005) studied the biosorption of three reactive dyes onto de ad biomass of C. vulgaris , 
concluding  that dye sorption was highly dependent on pH. Few works describing algal capacity for degrading oil have 
been published. Chaillan et al.  (2006) described the appearance of cyanobacterial mats ( Phormidium animale ) in 
petroleum -polluted site.  Radwan et al., 2002 confirmed that the macroalgae covered with b iofilm -forming bacteria 
can be able to degrade oil (Radwan et al., 2002).  Chlorella  sorokiniana  in aggregation with bacteria was able to 
successfully remove sali cylate from a photobioreactor in an experiment described by M unoz et al . (2006). 
Hydrocarbons, nevertheless, have been reported to be degraded by Ca -alginate immobilized colorless Prototheca  
zopfii  (Yamaguchi et al., 1999).  
 
Culturing for metabolite production  
Microalgae has been used as biocatalysts in biotransformation  and de novo biosynthesis ( Ignacio 2008 ). 
Biotransformation  of phenylpropanoid compounds to  HPLC -detectable vanilla flavour metabolites by free and  Ca-
alginate immobilized cells of Haematococcus  pluvialis  was described by Tripathi et al . (2002).  Immobilized cells 
showed higher v anillin accumulation  than fr ee cells . Santos -Rosa et al.  (1989) described t ransformation of nitrite into J. Algal Biomass Utln .  2016, 7  (2): 122- 128                                                                     Applications of immobilized algae

 ammonium in a medium  containing L -methionine -D, L-sulphoximine and the inhibitor of glutamine synthetase, ) by 
the use of a  Ba-alginate immobilized mutant strain of Chlamydomonas reindhartii .  Production of  polysaccharides by 
the unicellular red algae Porphyridium cruentum  immobilized in polyurethane foams  was studied by Thepenier et al. 
(1985) . At the beginning  of the tests, no oxygen evolution was observed in immobilized  cultures, due to high degree 
of cellular  destruction, although after many flushing rinses, survival  colonies began to grow again. W hen culture 
reaches stationary  phase, production of polysaccharides was noticeable . 
 
Culture collection handling  
Long -term storage of microalgae culture is a very  interesting topic, saving human and economic 
resources. The physiological activities of Ca  alginate  entrapped Scenedesmus  quadricauda cells were maintenaned 
by Chen (2001), upto three years by storage in darkness at 4oC without culture medium, with  the starving sym ptom of 
pyrenoid disappearance. After  replacing long -term stored beads in fresh media, the number  of immobilized coenobia 
increased  by 40 times  in four weeks . Chen, (2003) repeated the experience with Isochrysis  galbana , achieving good 
results after one year of storage. Joo et al., (2001) immobilized four microalgal  species viz., Dunaliella  bardawil , 
Chlorella  minutissima , Pavlova lutheri and Haematococcus  pluvialis  in Ca -alginate beads and achieved higher 
concentration  of encapsulated cells . Nowak et al ., (2005) designed a system  based in a 96 -well plate where a 
membrane filter, which  immobilizes algal strains, constitutes the bottom of each  well. This allows culturing of several 
microalgal  strains with less effort, time and money.  
 
Toxicity  Measurement   
Microalgae have been found to be sensitive organisms to different pollutants (Leon et al., 2001) in toxicity 
bioassays , possibly due to their high surface/volume ratio. Bozeman et al.  (1989), in a pioneering work, compared the 
toxicity of seven pollutants  such as Cd, Cu, Hydrothol, Glyphosate,  pentachlorophenol , Paraquat and sodium 
dodecyl sulphate to free and immobilized cells of the green microalga Selenastrum capricornutum  , suggesting the 
possibility of the use of immobilized systems in toxicity experiments. Several studies on toxicity of metals on algae 
confirmed the deleterious effect of metals to biological macromolecules (Tripathi et al., 2004). Toxicity assessment of 
a number of pesticides to immobilized cultures of the green alga Selenastrum capricornumtum was adopted by  
Abdel -Hamid, (1996). Naessens et al. (2000) constructed a new biosensor for t he detection of some herbicides viz., 
diuron, atrazine  and simazine ) based on kinetic measurements of chlorophyll -a fluorescence in immobilized Chlorella 
vulgaris cells. Slijkerman et al. (2005) studied the use of an in situ assay with immobilized Chlorella vulgaris as an 
indicator of effects on ecosystem functioning with regard to primary production. They used the herbicide linuron to 
induce direct eff ects on primary producers. Luan et al. (2006) studied the removal and degradation of tributyltin (TBT) 
contamination levels by alginate immobilized Chlorella vulgaris beads .Their results suggested that the alginate 
immobilized alga C.vulgaris was able to continuously detoxify TBT into DBTand  MBT for six consecutive cycles.  
Awasthi and Rai (2005) used immobilized Scenedesmus quadricauda to ass ess the toxicity of nickel, zinc and 
cadmium on nitrate uptake.  
 
Production of energy  (electricity or hydrogen)  
Bioproduction of hydrogen  has demonstrated to be environmental friendly and less  energy consumer when 
compared with thermochemical and  electrochemical processes (Kapdan and Kargi, 2006). Some  algae are able to 
produce hydrogen under  stress conditions  (Melis, 2002) such as the deprivati on of sulphur -nutrients  in green algae . 
Lack of sulphur prevents  the protein synthesis and algae cannot perform the  turnover of specific photosystem -II 
reaction centre protein.  Then, photochemical activity of PSII declines in the  absence of sulphur and oxy gen is 
released to the media at  lower rates than O 2 consumption . Dante  (2005 ) used C. reindhartii for the same experiment.  
Co-firing  of microalgal biomass with coal is another power -generating  procedure. CO 2 produced in power -plant fuel 
gas can be used to improve microalgal growth. Microalgal biomass  obtained in this way is burned again in the same  
power plant (Kadam, 2002). This could be a suitable way  of reducing the high amounts of carbon dioxide produced 
globally .

 Co-immobilized systems  
Efforts have been made in the field of co -immobilization  (Nagase et al. , 2006). De-Bashan et al. ( 2004) co -
immobilized Chlorella  sp.with a microalgae  growth -promoting bacterium ( Azospirillum brasiliense ) in Ca-alginate 
beads. This bacterium is not able to remove  nutrients from wastewaters, but enhances growth of immobilized  algae.  
Co-immobilized biological system removed  higher percentages of nutrients from wastewaters (100%  of ammonium, 
15% nitrate and 36% of phosphorus) when  compared with immobilized algal cells  without bacteria  (75% ammonium, 
6% nitrate and 19% phosphorus)  (Ignacio,  2008) . Munoz and Guieysse (2006) reviewed the interactions  between 
algae and bacteria in processes designed for the  treatment of hazardous contaminants. Production of oxygen  by 
algae  improves degradation of substances that must  be degraded aerobically. Consumption of CO 2 and extracellular  
matter production by algae  can enhance bacterial growth rate, as well as CO 2 and growth promoter substances 
production by bacteria can  enhance microalgal growth.  
 
Future prospects  
 
  The algal  immobilization is still an open area for various researches in  different fields. The  technology of 
immobilized algae proved to be very efficient  in remediation, heavy metals removal and toxicity  assessment. One of 
the most promising areas of research is  using this technology to reduce environmental pollutions  through bio -sorption 
and biodegradation of many harmful  compounds.  Immobilization techniques can be used in molecular  biology, as 
plasmid st ability in immobilized cells has been  reported (Cassidy et al., 1996). Risk of unwanted mutations  is reduced 
when cells are immobilized (Codd, 1987).Genetic manipulation of immobilized cyanobacteria  (hydrogenase negative 
gene) could also improve hydrogen  generation processes (Das and Veziroglu, 2001). Immobilized  microalgae have 
been recently used as a tool for water  quality control in fish culture. The use of microalgae in the design of biosensors 
is a very recent and interesting topic in biotechnology  (Chouteau  et al. , 2004 ). Combinations of solar energy and algal 
immobilization  technologies can be successfully used in industrial processes  (Mallick, 2002).
