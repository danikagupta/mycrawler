Decolorization of kraft pulp bleaching effluent by a newly isolated fungus, 
Geotrichum candidum Dec 1 
Received: April 10, 2001 / Accepted: November 26, 2001 
Abstract Kraft pulp bleaching effluent supplemented with 
glucose was decolorized by a newly isolated fungus 
Geotrichum candidum Dec 1 (Dec 1) that showed a wide 
decolorizing spectrum to synthetic dyes. When the glucose 
concentration in the effluent was 30g/1, the color removal 
and the reduction of absorbable organic halogens were 78 % 
and 43% after 7 days culture, respectively. The average 
molecular weight of colored substances measured by gel 
filtration chromatography was lowered to less than 3000 
from 5600 after 7 days culture. As the contribution of extra- 
cellular enzymes such as peroxidase (DyP), manganese per- 
oxidase, and laccase to the decolorization of the kraft pulp 
bleaching effluent was small, Dec i appears to have a differ- 
ent mechanism of decolorizing kraft pulp bleaching effluent 
when compared with enzymes used to decolorize synthetic 
dyes.

Introduction 
Kraft pulp bleaching effluent containing some colored sub- 
stances and chlorinated organic compounds is discarded as 
wastewater. These waste compounds are thought to cause 
environmental pollution 1'2 because of their poorly biode- 
gradable and toxic properties. Many methods have been 
developed to remove these wastes (e.g., lime coagulation, 
rapid land infiltration, membrane processes, polymeric 
adsorbents~), but these processes have problems, such as 
high energy costs and generation of hazardous by-products. 
Microbial treatments to degrade waste compounds have

e-mail: mshoda@res.titech.ac.jp also been reported. One of the most thoroughly studied 
microorganism is a white rot fungus, Phanerochaete 
chrysosporium, which has been shown to decolorize a kraft 
pulp bleaching effluent and dyestuff waste. 2'4 12 Pleurotus 
ostreatus, Coriolus versicolor, and Streptomyces spp. have 
also shown decolorizing activity of the effluent. 6'13-17 Al- 
though the microbial method saves energy cost when re- 
moving those wastes, it is difficult to apply the organisms for 
practical use because of their characteristics; they are plant 
pathogens, have limited substrate specificity, or have a slow 
growth rate. Therefore, developing a novel microorganism 
is urged. 
From this viewpoint, we screened a novel decolorizing 
fungus, Geotrichum candidum Dec 1, which has decolorized 
30 synthetic dyes and molasses. 18a9 We found that this strain 
secretes some enzymes, including a unique and novel per- 
oxidase that degrades those dyes, 2~ as well as manganese 
peroxidase. Moreover, this strain is not a pathogen, has 
wide degradative capacity for many substrates, and a faster 
growth rate than other white rot fungi. *s In this work, we 
note that Dec 1 decolorizes the kraft pulp bleaching effluent 
effectively and speculate on its decolorizing mechanism. 
Materials and methods 
Strain and preparation 
Geotrichum candidum Dec 1 was isolated in our labora- 
tory. is Potato dextrose (PD) medium was prepared by the 
following method. Commercial potato (50 g) was cut to 
blocks around 1 cm 3 and boiled in 1 1 of water for 30 rain. 
Then the potato was mashed and the suspension filtered 
using filter paper and vacuum aspiration. Glucose (20 g) 
was added to the obtained filtrate. This solution was made 
up to 1 1 with distilled water and adjusted to pH 5.5. A 10-#1 
aliquot of 25% glycerol stock suspension of Dec i spore was 
inoculated on a PD agar plate (90 mm r and incubated for 
10 days at 30~ The mycelia on three plates were collected 
and suspended in 10 ml of sterilized water with a vortex 
403 
mixer. The suspension was filtered with gauze, and the 
filtrate was obtained as a fresh spore suspension. 
Lignin decolorizing assay 
A 10-,ul aliquot of 25% glycerol stock suspension of Dec 1 
spore was inoculated on a GY agar plate (glucose 30g/l, 
yeast extract 3 g/l, K2HPO 4 1g/l, ammonium tartrate 0.5 g/l, 
MgSO4.7H20 0.5 g/l, and agar 15 g/l) containing commercial 
lignin lg/1 (Kanto Chemical, Tokyo, Japan). It was then 
incubated for 2 weeks at 30~ 
Effect of pH on the kraft pulp bleaching effluent 
The effluent at the alkaline extraction stage of hard wood 
pulp (E-effluent) provided by Oji Paper Co. was used as the 
kraft pulp bleaching effluent. This effluent (2ml) and 1 ml of 
25mM citrate buffer (pH 3.2, 4.5, or 5.0) were mixed, and 
the supernatant was obtained by centrifugation (12 000 rpm 
for 5 min). Absorbance of the supernatant at 465 nm against 
distilled water was measured using a spectrophotometer 
(Shimadzu, UV-2200). 
Culture method 
The E-effluent was adjusted to pH 5.0 with 2N HC1 
and centrifuged to remove insoluble particles (6000rpm, 
60 min). Glucose (0.75, 1.5, 3.0 or 4.5 g), ammonium tartrate 
(0.075g), KHaPO 4 (0.15g), MgSO4.7H20 (0.075g), and 
yeast extract (0.45 g) were added to 150 ml of the E-effluent 
in 500-ml shake flasks and sterilized (121~ 20min). Dec 1 
was inoculated into the flask and cultured with a reciprocal 
shaker (120spin) at 30~ for 10 days. As a control, 
the decolorization without cells was tested in 150ml of 
sterilized E-effluent mixture containing GY medium (glu- 
cose 30g/l, ammonium tartrate 0.5g/l, KH2PO4 1g/l, 
MgSO4"7H20 0.5 g/l, yeast extract 3 g/l) at pH 5.0, 4.0, and 
3.0 under the same conditions. 
Analytical methods 
Color removal 
The color of the effluent was determined by the standard 
method of the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association. 22 The 
absorbance at 465 nm against distilled water was measured 
using a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-2200). The ab- 
sorbance values were then transformed into color units 
(CU) according to the following formula. 
CU = 500 ¬ç 1 
where A1 corresponds to the A465 of a 500-CU platinum- 
cobalt standard solution (0.132); and A2 is the absorbance of 
the effluent sample. The color removal (%) was defined as 
the ratio of CU of the culture supernatant to that of the 
initial medium. The average initial color unit of the E- 
effluent was 4200. Color adsorption to cells 
To investigate if color removal depends on the adsorption 
to the cells, colored substances were extracted with alkaline 
solution from the cells of the culture that showed maximum 
color removal during a culture period. After 3, 4, and 9 days 
of culture in the case of glucose concentrations of 5, 10, and 
30g/l, respectively, the CU of the culture supernatant was 
determined by the method described above. The obtained 
cells were agitated with 30ml of 2N NaOH for 5rain and 
then centrifuged (12000rpm for 5min). The absorbance 
(465nm) of the supernatant was measured, and its value 
was converted against the initial volume of the medium. 
The CU was then estimated to be the amount of colored 
substances adsorbed to the cells. 
Absorbable organic halogens 
Absorbable organic halogens (AOX) of E-effluent was 
measured with the AOX analyzer (TOX-10; Mitsubishi- 
Kasei, Tokyo, Japan). The initial AOX of the E-effluent 
was 34.2 mg/1. 
Gel filtration of E-effluent 
To estimate the distribution of the molecular weight of the 
colored substances in the E-effluent, Sephadex G-75 
(Amersham-Pharmacia, Tokyo, Japan) gel filtration col- 
umn chromatography (2.6 ¬ç 110cm), of which the fraction 
range was 3000 to 80000 as globular protein, was per- 
formed. The elution solvent was 0.75 M NaC1, and the flow 
rate was 15ml/h. The colored substances were detected at 
280nm absorbance. Trypsin (MW 24000), aprotinin (MW 
6512), and vitamin B (MW 1355) were used as the standard 
molecular size markers. With this chromatography, sub- 
stances with a molecular weight lower than 3000 are eluted 
together. 
Enzyme assay 
DyP assay. DyP is a novel peroxidase from G. candidum 
Dec i already reported by us. 2~ Reactive blue 5 (RB5; e600 = 
8800M-lcm-1), a representative anthraquinone dye, was 
used as the substrate. The substrate solution consists of 
100ppm (final) of RB5 in 25mM citrate buffer pH 3.2. The 
0.6ml of culture supernatant, prepared by centrifugation 
(12000 rpm, 5min), was mixed with the substrate solution, 
and then H202 was added at a final concentration of 0.2mM. 
The total volume of the enzyme reaction was adjusted to 
3 ml. The enzyme activity was calculated from the decrease 
in absorbance at 600nm (A600)- One unit of enzyme activity 
was defined as the amount of the enzyme that decolorized 
1,umol of RB5 at 30~ for lmin. 
Manganese peroxidase assay. Guaiacol was used as 
the substrate for the manganese peroxidase (MnP) assay. 1~ 
The total volume of the enzyme reaction was adjusted to 
3ml. The 0.6ml of culture supernatant of Dec 1, guaiacol, 
and MnSO 4 at a final concentration of 0.1mM were mixed 
404

mercial lignin by Dec 1. Left, lignin- 
containing plate (1g/l) after 2

Right, lignin-containing plate (1 g/l) 
after 2 weeks of incubation with no 
inoculation 
and adjusted to 2.99ml of 0.1M sodium tartrate (pH 5.0); 
then H202 at a final concentration of 0.1mM was added. 
The enzyme activity, calculated from the increase in absor- 
bance at 465nm (A465) as the molecular extinction 
coefficient (465) of the reaction product, was 
12 000 M -1 cm -1. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as 
the amount of enzyme that reacted with l#mol of guaiacol 
at 30~ for 1rain. 
Lignin peroxidase assay. Veratryl alcohol was used as the 
substrate for the lignin peroxidase assay.l~ The total volume 
of the enzyme reaction was adjusted to 3 ml. The 0.6ml of 
culture supernatant of Dec 1 and veratryl alcohol at a final 
concentration of 2mM were mixed and adjusted with 
2.97ml of 50raM tartrate (pH 2.5); then H202 at a final 
concentration of 0.4mM was added. The enzyme activity, 
calculated from the increase in absorbance at 310nm (A310) 
as the molecular extinction coefficient (e310) of the reaction 
product, was 9300M-~cm -1. One unit of enzyme activity 
was defined as the amount of the enzyme that reacted with 
1,umol of veratryl alcohol at 30~ for 1 rain. 
Laccase assay. 2,2'-Azino-di- (3-ethylbenzthiazoline)-6'- 
sulfonate (ABTS) was used as the substrate for the laccase 
(Lac) assay. 23 The total volume of the enzyme reaction was 
adjusted to 3 ml. Them 0.6ml of the culture supernatant of 
Dec 1 and 2.99ml of 0.1mM sodium tartrate (pH 5.0) were 
mixed, and ABTS at a final concentration of 0.5mM 
was added. The enzyme activity, calculated from the in- 
crease in absorbance at 420nm (A420) as the molecular 
extinction coefficient (e420) of the reaction product, was 
36000M-lcm -1. One unit of the enzyme activity was 
defined as the amount of the enzyme that reacted with 
l#mol of ABTS at 30~ for lmin. Results 
Decolorization of lignin by Dec 1 
The lignin-containing plate was decolorized by Dec 1 after 
2 weeks in culture, as shown in Fig. 1. 
Effect of pH on E-effluent 
When the pH of the effluent was adjusted to 3.2, 4.5, or 5.0, 
the absorbances at 465 nm against distilled water were 
0.474, 0.494, and 0.512, respectively. The faint decrease of 
the absorbance at an acidic pH resulted in only partial 
precipitation of colored substances. Therefore, it was clear 
that the pH difference did not drastically affect the decol- 
orization of the effluent. 
Decolorization of E-effluent 
The time courses for color removal and the pH of E-effluent 
at various glucose concentrations are shown in Fig. 2. The 
residual glucose concentrations are shown in Fig. 3. The 
maximum color removal was 78% after 5 days of culture in 
the E-effluent containing glucose 20 g/1. The maximum color 
removal was also 78% after 6 days of culture in the E- 
effluent containing glucose 30g/1. Color removal was 47% 
after 3 days of culture when the E-effluent contained glu- 
cose 5g/1 but decreased to 0 after 4 days. Color removal 
declined after glucose was completely consumed in all 
cases, but the pH increased when color removal decreased. 
On the other hand, when Dec t was not inoculated into the 
sterilized E-effluent mixture, color removal was 15% at 
most, as shown in Table 1. 
Color adsorption to cells 
The relation between color removal and color adsorption is 
summarized in Table 2. When the glucose concentration 
was 5g/l, 100% of the color removal was due to color 
adsorption to the cells: On the other hand, when it was 10 
or 30g/l, the ratio of decomposed colored substances for 
color removal increased to 62% and 90%, respectively.

increased, achieving 43% and 78% after 7 days of culture, 
respectively. 
Gel filtration column chromatography of E-effluent 
The molecular weight of the main colored substances of the 
E-effluent was calculated from the elution peak, as shown in 
Fig. 5. and was estimated to be 5600. After 7 days the 
molecular weight of the colored substances apparently 
decreased and was estimated to be less than 3000 because 
its elution point was the same as that of vitamin B, as shown 
in Fig. 5. 
Enzyme activity and color removal 
The time courses of color removal and enzyme activities of 
the culture supernatant are shown in Fig. 6. Color removal 
started at 1 day and increased rapidly up to 5 days. DyP 
activity appeared after 5 days. On the other hand, the activ- 
ity of MnP was weak compared with that of DyP, The 
activities of LiP and Lac were not observed. 
Discussion 
The main colored substances of general kraft pulp bleach- 
ing effluent were lignin and its related compounds. 24 
Decolorizing activity by Dec 1 toward a commercial lignin 
on plate assay is obvious, as shown in Fig. 1. This result 100

Fig. 6. Time courses of color removal and enzyme activities of kraft 
pulp bleaching effluent supplemented with glucose 30g/1. Squares, 
color removal; circles, DyP activity; triangles, manganese peroxidase 
activity 
indicates that the decolorization is not due solely to adsorp- 
tion of the colored substances to the Dec 1 cells. 
Dec i decolorized the kraft pulp bleaching effluent when 
glucose was supplemented, as shown in Fig. 2. No color 
removal and growth were observed without glucose (data 
not shown). When the glucose concentrations were 10, 20, 
and 30g/l, color removal reached more than 70% after 
4 days in culture and the pH decreased. As the pH decrease 
in acidic conditions did not affect decolorization of the ef- 
fluent, the color removal was associated with Dec 1 activity. 
At a glucose concentration of 30g/1 color removal main- 
tained a high level (>70%) after 4 days of culture but 
decreased and the pH increased after complete consump- 
tion of glucose at other glucose concentrations. The pH 
increase suggests that by-products such as organic acids, 
which were converted from glucose by Dec 1, were further 
consumed by Dec 1 at 5, 10, and 20g/1. The decreased color 
removal in accordance with the pH increase strongly sug- 
gested that the adsorbed colored substances left the cells. 
This desorption was supported by results showing that the 
colored substances were eluted from the cells at low glucose 
concentrations, as summarized in Table 2. 
Although the mechanism is unknown, color removal by 
Dec i is thought to proceed through two steps. The first step 
is color adsorption to the cells. Actually, the color of the cell 
pellet was observed to be enhanced gradually up to 3 to 
4 days of culture. The second step is decomposition of the 
adsorbed colored substances. Probably the second step is 
induced by some secondary metabolites. If this is true, the 
shortage of glucose for the growth of Dec 1 results in insuf- 
ficient production of those secondary metabolites. This hy- 
pothesis is not inconsistent with the data showing that the 
time course of color removal at a lower glucose concentra- 
tion revealed more significantly reduced color removal after 
complete consumption of glucose, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3. 
We estimated the molecular weight of the main colored 
substances of the E-effluent by gel filtration chromatogra- 
phy to be 5600. This value is not when high compared 
with other natural polymers such as polysaccharides and 
proteins. Therefore, the main structures of the colored 
substances were thought to be various derivatives from the 
partial degraded lignin-related compounds. The molecular 
weight of the E-effluent treated with Dec 1 became less 
than 3000, suggesting that Dec 1 degraded large molecular 
compounds, such as lignin-related compounds, to smaller 
compounds. 
The decrease in AOX is the most important factor when 
evaluating the degree of waste cleanup. The main AOXs in 
the effluent were thought to be aromatic compounds (e.g., 
lignin and its derivatives) containing halogen. The decreas- 
ing AOX content was reported to be 48%-65% and 23%- 
32% by an activated sludge method and an aerobic lagoon 
method, respectivelyff '26 Lee et al. ~6 reported that the de- 
creasing contents of AOX were 40% and 25% using strain 
KS-62 (genus and species unknown) and C. versicolor, 
respectively. Dec 1 showed 43% AOX, which suggested 
that Dec 1 decolorized several aromatic halogens generat- 
ing from lignin and chlorine during the pulp bleaching 
process. 
So far, many researchers have reported enzymes related 
to lignin degradation and decolorization of kraft pulp 
bleaching effluent. LiP and MnP are well known represen- 
tatives of lignin-degrading enzymes] 7'28 Gold and co- 
workers reported that MnP was more effective than LiP for 
decolorizing kraft pulp bleaching effluent] 9 However, the 
purified LiP showed no decolorizing activity. 1~ Other re- 
searchers have reported that MnPs of white rot fungi played 
an essential role in decolorizing of the kraft pulp bleaching 
effluent. 26'3~ When the purified MnP from P. chrysosporium 
was used to decolorize the effluent in vitro, the decolorizing 
ratio was only 25%, although it achieved 75% in vivo. 1~ This 
finding suggests that extracellular enzyme(s) other MnP or 
intracellular enzymes are of importance to the decoloriza- 
tion process. One of those important enzymes was reported 
to be laccase. The decolorization of kraft pulp bleaching 
effluent using Trametes versicolor especially depended on 
laccase. 3~ Therefore, so far MnP and laccase have been 
thought to play an important role in decolorization. 
In this study, it is unclear what enzymes are associated 
with decolorization. Whereas Dec i showed more than 70% 
color removal of the E-effluent, MnP activity was low and 
LiP and laccase activities were not observed. As Dec 1 has 
lignin-decolorizing activity, as shown in Fig. 1, it is possible 
that the decolorizing system of Dec 1 is different from that 
of other known fungi such as P. chrysosporium and T. 
versicolor, or the role of the intracellular enzymes is 
significant. Moreover, DyP, which is involved in decoloriz- 
ing synthetic dyes, is not thought to be a primary enzyme for 
decolorizing the effluent because its expression timing was 
delayed from the decolorizing timing of E-effluent by Dec 1, 
as shown in Fig. 6. 
Dec 1 exhibited decolorizing ability for both synthetic 
dyes and natural-colored substances such as lignin-related 
compounds. These characteristics are considered to be 407 
advantageous for developing a practical method to clean 
up wastewater, including various artificial and natural 
pollutants.
