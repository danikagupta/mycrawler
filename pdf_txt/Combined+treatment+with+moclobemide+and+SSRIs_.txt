Fatal Serotonin Toxicity Caused by Moclobemide and
Fluoxetine Overdose
Ming-Ling Wu1,2, MD, MPH; Jou-Fang Deng1, MD
Both moclobemide and fluoxetine are used in the treatment of depression, and have
been shown to produce fewer side effects than conventional tricyclic antidepressants. Acombination of moclobemide and fluoxetine has been used in refractory depression, howev-er there is potential for severe serotonin toxicity. We describe a lethal case of serotonin toxi-city in a 36 year-old woman after she ingested multiple drugs, including moclobemide 4500mg, fluoxetine 200 mg, propranolol 300 mg and several benzodiazepines. The clinical fea-tures included coma, mydriasis, hyperthermia, tremor, hyperreflexia, rhabdomyolysis, renalfailure and respiratory insufficiency. Eventually, the patient died of disseminated intravascu-lar coagulation and circulatory collapse at 22.5 h postingestion. Toxicological analysis of thepatient’s blood confirmed high levels of moclobemide 150 µg/mL (therapeutic 1-3 µg/mL),
fluoxetine 3750 ng/mL (therapeutic 47-469 ng/mL) and several benzodiazepines. In conclu-sion, a combination of moclobemide and fluoxetine should be avoided in depressed patientswith high suicidal tendencies. Moreover, early recognition and aggressive intervention arethe mainstays in the management of potentially life-threatening serotonin toxicity. (Chang

primarily resulting in activation of serotonin 
2A
receptors in the central and peripheral nervous sys-tems.
(1,2)It is typically associated with combinations
of drugs that augment serotonin synthesis, enhanceits release, block its metabolism, inhibit its reuptake,or act as direct receptor agonists.
(2)Serotonergic
excess can also occur after overdose of a serotoner-gic drug.
Symptoms of serotonin toxicity are character-
ized by a clinical triad of (1) neuromuscular hyperac-tivity: tremor, clonus, myoclonus, hyperreflexia andin the advanced stage, pyramidal rigidity; (2) auto-nomic hyperactivity: diaphoresis, fever, mydriasis,tachycardia, moderately elevated blood pressure and
tachypnea; and (3) altered mental status: excitementand agitation, with confusion in the advanced stagesonly.
(3)
Moclobemide is a reversible selective inhibitor
of monamine oxidase type A, with a short elimina-tion half-life of 1-2 hours. It has a lower propensityfor producing drug interactions than the first genera-tion of irreversible, nonselective inhibitors of mon-amine oxidase.
(4)Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Its half-life is 2-7 days,whereas that of its active metabolite “norfluoxetine”is 7-15 days.
(5)Both moclobemide and fluoxetine are
used in the treatment of depression, and have beenshown to produce fewer side effects than conven-

tional tricyclic antidepressants. However fatal sero-
tonin toxicity may develop after combined use ofthese two drugs.

serotonin toxicity with rhabdomyolysis, renal failureand disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) inaddition to neurologic complications followingintentional ingestion of a 10-day therapeutic dose ofmoclobemide and fluoxetine.
CASE REPORT
A 36-year-old woman was brought to the emer-
gency room after she deliberately ingested multipledrugs. She was sent to a hospital nearby 5.5 h afteringestion. Her laboratory studies and electrocardio-gram (ECG) were normal at that time and she under-went therapy with gastric lavage and activated char-coal. The serum tricyclic antidepressant level was6.29 ng/ml (therapeutic level 100-300 ng/mL).Arterial blood gas analysis was pH 7.374, pCO
243.4
mmHg, pO296.4 mmHg, and HCO325.5 mmol/L.
She was referred to our hospital about 9 h afteringestion of the drugs.
On arrival, the patient fell into a coma and her
Glasgow coma scale was E2V1M1. Her blood pres-sure was 104/66 mmHg, pulse rate 89 beats perminute, respiratory rate 24 per minute and body tem-perature 40.6°C. Mydriasis, diaphoresis and general-ized muscle twitching were also noted. Two 10 mgboluses of diazepam were given intravenously forcontrol of seizure-like activity. Laboratory studiesshowed leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of13,000/mL (84% neutrophils). Blood urea nitrogen,creatinine, creatinine phosphokinase and electrolyteswere within normal limits. There were mild eleva-tions of liver aminotransferses. Arterial blood gasanalysis under oxygen at two liters per min was pH7.4, pCO
241.8 mmHg, pO241.2 mmHg, and HCO3
27.4 mmol/L. The serial laboratory tests are summa-rized in the Table. Chest radiography disclosed noactive lung lesions.
At 11.6 h postingestion, bradycardia, oxygen
desaturation and a drop in blood pressure necessitat-ed treatment with fluid resuscitation, atropine, vaso-pressors, intubation and mechanical ventilation. Shewas stabilized and admitted to the intensive care unit(ICU).
The patient had a history of major depression
for several years and had attempted suicide once bytaking an overdose of prescribed drugs. She was fol-
lowed up in an outpatient psychiatric unit for oneyear and took regular medication including fluoxe-tine 20 mg per day; moclobemide 150 mg, propranol10 mg, and alprazolam 0.5 mg, all three times a day;and estazolam 2 mg, bromazepam 6 mg, lorazepam 1mg and midazolam 7.5 mg at bedtime. She tookabout a 10-day amount of prescribed medication andthe estimated ingested doses were moclobemide4,500 mg, fluoxetine 200 mg, propranolol 300 mg,estazolam 20 mg, bromazepam 60 mg, alprazolam15 mg, lorazepam 10 mg and midazolam 75 mg.
Under mechanical ventilation in the ICU, her
body temperature was 41.3°, pulse 140 beats/min,and blood pressure 70/30 mmHg, and her respiratoryrate was mechanical ventilation dependent. Therewas no response to deep stimuli and the Glasgowcoma scale was E1VTM1. Her pupils were 6 mmand isocoric without light reflex.

severe sweating. She had unusual body movements
including shivering and tremors. The four limbs weremildly rigid, the deep tendon reflexes were increasedand the Babinski sign was positive. The ECG dis-closed sinus tachycardia, a widening QRS and pro-longation of the QT interval. At 18 h postingestion,the follow-up laboratory data showed her conditionhad deteriorated with leukocytosis (white blood cellcount 21,000/mL) with a left shift, thrombocytopenia(platelets 58,000/mL) and elevated levels of creati-nine (2.4 mg/dL), creatine phosphokinase (3,718U/L), and glucose 343 mg/dL. Oral bleeding, ecchy-mosis, progressive hypotension and ventriculararrhythmias developed. Despite intensive treatment,she eventually died of DIC and circulatory collapseat 22.5 h postingestion. The determination of druglevels by a method using high performance liquidchromatography revealed high serum levels ofmoclobemide 150 µg/mL (therapeutic 1-3 µg/mL),
fluoxetine 3750 ng/mL (therapeutic 47-469 ng/mL)and several benzodiazepines (estazolam 553 ng/mL,bromazepam 412 ng/mL, alprazolam 284 ng/mL,lorazepam 55 ng/mL, diazepam 175 ng/mL, and nor-diazepam 163 ng/mL).
DISCUSSION
The typical clinical features of serotonin excess
in humans are neuromuscular hyperactivity, auto-nomic derangement, and altered mental status.
(1)
Initially, our patient presented with coma and sus-tained tremor. Then she developed hyperthermia, andhypertonicity, which is a potentially life-threateningsign. Finally, rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, respira-tory insufficiency, intractable hypotension and DICensued. The findings were consistent with a diagno-sis of severe serotonin toxicity.
Based on current knowledge, serotonin toxicity
develops due to actions at serotonin type 2 receptorsin humans.
(1)Central serotonin excess causes muscle
hyperactivity which predisposes patients to hyper-thermia, metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis,impaired respiration, renal failure and DIC. Thepathogenesis of DIC is not clear yet. It may arise as aconsequence of hyperthermia and platelet activa-tion.
(2,7)Platelets contain serotonin in dense granules
and have serotonin type 2 receptors, and may alsocontribute to development of coagulopathy and DICwith the release of platelet-derived serotonin.Our patient had major depression. She was treat-
ed with moclobemide, fluoxetine, propranolol, andseveral benzodiazepines at a psychiatric clinic.Toxicological analysis of the patient’s blood revealed
high levels of moclobemide, fluoxetine and severalbenzodiazepines. In one report, patients ingesting upto 2,000 mg moclobemide alone showed only mildgastrointestinal symptoms or were asymptomatic.
(8)
Those ingesting 3000 to 4000 mg showed slightincreases in blood pressure and depressed conscious-ness, while those ingesting 7000 to 8000 mg hadfatigue, agitation, tachycardia, increased blood pres-sure, and mydriasis. In patients who ingested fluoxe-tine alone in Mill’s study, the mean dosage was 341mg in asymptomatic patients and 544 mg in sympto-matic ones.
(9)Our patient ingested 4,500 mg of
moclobemide and 200 mg of fluoxetine and died ofDIC and circulatory collapse within 24 hourspostingestion.
Moclobemide is rapidly absorbed, reaching a
peak plasma level within 0.5 to 2 hours after a singletherapeutic dose. Blood concentrations followingtherapeutic administration of a single dose of 50-800mg moclobemide are in the range of 0.36-7.76µg/mL.
(10)Post-mortem blood levels associated with
assumed therapeutic use have been observed in therange of 0.2-2.1 µg/mL, while concentrations in
lethal cases involving combined ingestion ofmoclobemide and other drugs were 1.9-58µg/mL.
(11,12)Blood concentrations in 3 reports of
lethal overdoses of moclobemide alone were 15.5,137, and 498 µg/mL.
(10,13,14)Our patient had a blood
moclobemide level of 150 µg/mL, which was a
potentially lethal level.
Studies have reported that refractory depression
might profit from a combination of moclobemidewith other antidepressants, such as clomipramine oran SSRI, though the combination is associated withsome risk of serotonin toxicity. However clinicalconcern was raised by an open study by Hawley etal. In that study, moclobemide (600 mg/day) wascombined with either paroxetine or fluoxetine inpatients with treatment-resistant depression. In 50patients studied, there was a high rate of severeadverse events including one definite serotonin toxi-city.
(15)The Hawley group decided to stop their
research because of high levels of moderately severeserotonergic side effects, especially with moclobe-mide plus venlafaxine. Isbister studied 106 moclobe-

mide overdoses from the Hunter Area Toxicology
Service (HATS) database. Of these patients, 33 whoingested moclobemide alone and 52 who ingestedmoclobemide with a nonserotonergic drug did nothave serotonin toxicity. One of the patients with amoclobemide-alone overdose (3%) developed sero-tonin toxicity. However, 52% of the 21 patients whoingested moclobemide combined with a serotonergicdrug exhibited serotonin toxicity, even though theother serotonergic drug had often been ingested onlyin therapeutic quantities, not as an overdose. In 6 ofthese 21 cases (29%), severe serotonin toxicitydeveloped with a body temperature > 38.5°C andmuscle rigidity requiring intubation and paralysis.
(16)
Moclobemide rarely precipitates serotonin toxi-
city in overdoses by itself, and it seldom producessignificant serotonergic side effects in clinical use.The HATS database also disclosed an overdose of aSSRI alone produced only moderate serotonin toxici-ty in 14-16% of cases, but no serious sequele orfatalities.
(17)The risk with moclobemide and sero-
tonin reuptake inhibitors combined is almost certain-ly much lower than with older irreversiblemonoamine oxidase inhibitors and serotonin reup-take inhibitors combined. However, the combinationof moclobemide and a serotonin reuptake inhibitorstill has a predictable risk of serotonin toxicity.
(4)
Management of serotonin toxicity begins with
removal of the offending agents. Supportive care isthe treatment of choice for most cases. Benzodi-azepines are essential for management of serotonintoxicity, and can help control agitation and muscularhyperactivity. Moderate cases should have all ther-mal and cardiorespiratory abnormalities correctedand may benefit from the administration of serotoninantagonists. Patients with high blood pressure ortachycardia should be treated with short-actingagents such as esmolol or nitroprusside. Severe casescomplicated by hyperthermia need to be treatedaggressively, and should receive the above therapiesas well as aggressive cooling, neuromuscular paraly-sis, endotracheal intubation and assisted ventilation.
(1)
Our case received only supportive care because themanifestations of severe serotonin effects had beenoverlooked, and because of the lethal combinationdoses of moclobemide and fluoxetine and the rapidprogression of the illness. Physician’s awareness ofsevere serotonin toxicity is important in treatingthese patients.Serotonin toxicity is not an unusual event in
psychopharmacological combination therapy. Thepharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactionsbetween moclobemide and fluoxetine may result insome severe complications. Our patient receivedcombination therapy with moclobemide and fluoxe-tine in therapeutic doses which did not cause a druginteraction. However, she developed lethal serotonintoxicity after intentional ingestion of only a 10-dayamount. Although combinations of moclobemide andfluoxetine have been used in clinical practice, thepossible risk of intentional overdose can not be over-looked. Therefore, these ill-advised combinationsshould be avoided in depressed patients with highsuicidal tendencies.
