Discharge of textile waste water into river streams 
distorts the water quality to a larger extent and especially, t he 
azo dyes and effluent are responsible for dual pollution; 
firstly due to their strong color index that causes aesthetic problems and secondly, obstruction of sunlight penetration and oxygen transfer into water bodies (Pinheiro et al., 2004). 
Dyes are highly recalcitrant in nature and are chemical mutagens that are toxic to the biotic components of the 
ecosystem (Martins et al., 2002; Sponza and I șik, 2005). The 
azo bond undergoes reductive cleavage to form carcinogenic intermediates (aromatic amines) and induces mutation in the 
biological systems.
The conventional physico-chemical treatments 
decolorize the effluent but fail to detoxify them; thus the situation demands the necessity to eliminate the color and toxicity of these carcinogenic intermediates (Karthikeyan et 
al.,2014; Vidhyadevi et al ., 2014; Madhu et al.,  2009). 
Biological systems as a whole or enzyme formulations are known to be better option in all the fields related to 
biochemical engineering (Vinodhini et al.,  2015;Seenuvasan 
et al., 2014a,b,c,d; Seenuvasan et al., 2013a,b).Thus, dye bio-Abstract
The acclimated cells of Achromobacter xylosoxidans  strain APZ wereemployed  to 
decolorize a textile colorant, Reactive green 19A (RG19A) of gr eater tinctorial 
strength.The strain decolorized and simultaneously mineralized RG19Awith a high 
-1average decolorization rate of 208.33  μgmin under normal operating (pH 7.0 and 35°C) 
and static conditions. The spectral and chromatographic data de scribed that the 
decolorization was due to biodegradation facilitated by the ext racellular oxidoreductases 
secreted by A. xylosoxidans  strain APZ.  The extent of RG19A mineralization during 
biotransformation was monitored by measuring the percentage red uction in the 
concentration of chemical oxygen demand and released aromatic a mines. Plant growth 
parameters of seedlings of Phaseolus mungo, Triticum aestivum and Sorghum bicolor 
seedlings were assessed to monitor toxicity reduction.

degradation using microorganisms (fungi, bacteria) and 
enzymes show consistent performance to biotransform and detoxify the reactive dyes (Palanivelan et al., 2014; Biyik et 
al., 2012). Bacterial degradation of azo dyes under aerobic 
and anaerobic mode can be achieved by inducing either pure or consortial forms, which renders good performance in mineralizing the aromatic amines released during reductive cleavage of azo bonds (Balaji et al., 2014; Prasad and Rao, 
2014; Laowansiri et al., 2008; Kapdan et al.,  2003). Thus, 
microbial decolorization by biodegradation with 
concomitant detoxification is an environmentally reliable technique alternate to the conventional decomposition techniques (Selvanaveen et al ., 2015; Dayaman and 
Dasgupta, 2008; Ambrósio and Takaki, 2004).
Materials and Methods
Isolation and identification of RG19A acclimated cells : A 
mixed bacterial culture, previously reported to degrade and mineralize an azo dye; acid red 88 (Kumar et al.,  2015) was 
used as seed culture for isolating an acclimated strain. The culture was acclimated to RG19A in Bushnell-Haas medium 
-1(BHM) containing RG19A (100-500 mgl ) with a simultane-
-1ous decreas in glucose concentration (1.0 to 0.1 g l ) incubated at 37°C under static condition. The cells which 
-1were able to survive 300 mgl RG19A in the absence of 
glucose were considered as acclimated cells. The isolate was 
identified using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and the culture was maintained as glycerol stock preserved at −80°C.
RG19A biotransformation experiments : The ability of 
cells to decolorize RG19A was carried out by inoculating 1.0 ml of fully grown cells of the strain in an Erlenmeyer flask 
-1containing 100 ml of 100 mgl  RG19A in BHM under static condition. After complete decolorization, the biotransformed products were recovered following the method of Kumar et 
al. (2015).
Analytical methods : An aliquot of culture media was 
withdrawn after decolorization and centrifuged at 10,000 This paper reports the ability of A. xylosoxidans  strain 
APZ in catalyzing the degradation and detoxification of a textile dye RG19A. The mineralization of RG19A facilitated by the various extracellular oxido-reductases were studied. RG19A biotransformation was revealed using the spectral and chromatographic techniques and phyto-toxicological assessments were done to determine the extent of 
detoxification.rpm for 15 min to separate the biomass. Decolorization was 
quantitatively analyzed and compared with abiotic control (without microorganism) in Shimadzu UV–1800 
spectrophotometer (Tokyo, Japan) in the range 300–900 nm.

percentage RG19A decolorization (%D) for RG19A 
-1concentration, C (mgl ) after decolorization time t (min) 
were calculated by the following formula given below;
Characterization of biotransformed products : The initial 
RG19A and decolorized solutions were scanned in a UV-vis 
spectrophotometer to monitor the changes in the absorbance peak. The functional groups in RG19A and products were 
−1characterized in the mid-IR region (400–4000 cm ) using Perkin Elmer 237B Infrared spectrometer. HPLC profile 
were recorded using Shimadzu, Japan using HPLC grade methanol as mobile phase. The analytes (RG19A and 
products) were detected at 640 and 325 nm while maintaining 
-1the flow rate at 1.0 ml min  with 10 min run time in C18 
column (symmetry, 4.6 × 250 mm). TLC analysis were carried out by dissolving the analytes in methanol: ethyl acetate: n-propanol: water: acetic acid (1:2:3:1:0.2, v/v) and 
were spotted on Aluchrosep Silica Gel 60/UV  supported on 
254
aluminum sheets, SDFCL, Mumbai. GC–MS analysis was carried on Agilent 5975C Shimadzu; Japan equipped with an HP–5 capillary column. Helium was used as a carrier gas at a 
-1flow rate 1.0 ml min  for 30 min run time.
Assays for elucidating the activities of oxido-reductases : 
The cells were grown in BHM in the presence and absence 
(control) of RG19A for 8 hrs, and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm 
for 30 min at 4°C. The resulting supernatant was used as source for assaying activities of lignin peroxidases 
(Shanmugam et al.,  1999), veratryl alcohol oxidase 
(Bourbonnais and Paice, 1988), azo-reductase (Maier et al.,  
2004), tyrosinase (Zhang and Flurkey, 1997) and laccase (Kumar et al.,  2012b) activity spectrophotometrically. The 
reference blanks contained all the components, except the assayed enzyme solution. All enzyme assays were carried out at room temperature in triplicate.

-1amide. A peak at 1583 cm  represented the N=N stretch of azo 
-1bond and 1280 cm  confirm the azoic nature of RG19A. A 
-1peak at 1487 cm showed N=O stretching vibrations and 
-1values at 1418 and 1280 cm  showed OH deformation and C-
-1N vibration of amines. A peak at 1179 cm  represents the 
-1aromatic N-CH  stretching vibrations. A peak at 1134 cm  3
describes the asymmetric C-OH stretching vibrations. A peak 
-1at 1134, 1045, 1078 and 841 cm  for S=O stretching 
vibrations confirmed the presence of sulfones and sulfoxide 
(sulfur containing nature of the benzene ring). The bands 
-1below 900 cm  indicated the aromatic nature of RG19A, the 
-1spectra had peaks at 912, 713 and 635 cm  for C-H and C-S 
stretching of vinyl (C=CH ), aroma tic (para-disubstituted 2
benzene ring) and aromatic (mono-substituted benzene ring). 
-1A weak to medium bond at 547 cm represented the C-X 
-1stretching of chloro–alkanes. A peak value of 2366 cm  
represented the NH stretching of amines as shown in Fig.1(a).
FT–IR spectra of the products exhibited new peaks at 
-13902, 3852 and 3750 cm representing weak to medium 
appearance of N-H stretching of secondary amines. A peak at 
-13435 cm  represent NH overtone and formation of amides. A 
-1broad peak at 2623 cm  for N-H stretching of ammonium 
-1ions and 2345 cm  represented the presence of charged amines. CN and C=O stretching vibrations were found at 
-11934 and 1653 cm for carboxylic acid associated with 
-1amides. A peak 1653 cm showed CH bending vibrations 
with asymmetric deformation of alkanes and formation of 
-1amides. A Peak at 1653 cm  represented the formation of benzene ring with C=O stretching and explained the 
-1reduction of azo bond. The absence of peak at 1583 cm  
illustrated the breakdown of primary and secondary nitro 
compounds. The formation of nitro compounds was 
-1 -1 represented by a peak at 1569 cm . A peak 1137cmdescribed C-O stretch as in case of secondary and tertiary 
-1alcohols. A peak 1213 cm  corresponds to C-O stretching of 
phenols, NO  stretch and OH deformation from primary to 2
secondary alcohols. A weak to strong bond peak value 1413 
-1 -1cm  supported by 977 cm  represents N=O stretching 
-1vibrations, and CH deformation. A peak at 628 cm  
represented C-H stretching vibrations, and disappearance of 
-11280 and 1583 cm represented the breakdown of N=N and 
-1loss of azoic nature, respectively. A peak at 2367 cm  
represented the NH stretch ofsecondary amines supported by 
-1peaks at 3852 and 3902 cm . The absence of peak at 1487  liberated aromatic amines during oxidoreductive breakdown 
of RG19A was measured to estimate the mineralization 
(Kumar et al., 2015). The detoxification analyses were done

Results and Discussion
Bacterial cells provide a viable and an inexpensive 
tool in aiding bioremediation of industrial effluent 
(Selvanaveen et al.,  2015; Kumar et al.,  2015,2014; Syed et 
al.,2009). The cells acclimated to RG19A Bushnelt 
-1completely decolorized 500 mg l  RG19A in the absence of 
glucose in the The acclimated strain was identified as Achromobacter 
xylosoxidans strain APZ using 16SrRNA gene sequencing 
and their phylogenetic relationship was studied (Figure not shown). The strain exhibited an ADR  value of 208.33 
RG19A
-1 -1µgmin  when inoculated with 100 mg l  RG19A for 8 hrs 
under the static condition at pH 7.0 and 37°C. Decolorization was due to the bacterial action and not due to variation in pH (Kumar et al.,  2012a).
The UV-vis spectral profile displayed a decreased 
absorbance for the products when compared with RG19A; this explains that cells of A. xylosoxidans strain APZ 
catalyzed the degradationof RG19A. The spectrum displayed 
peaks at 640 and 325 nm for initial RG19A and products, illustrating that RG19A decolorization was due to 
biodegradation (Figure not shown).
FT-IR spectra of RG19A displayed peaks at different

1H-NMR spectra of the products showed peaks 
between 2.21 to 2.64 ppm indicating the presence of methyl protons and CH -C=O functional moiety. Weak signals for 
3
aromatic protons in between 6.0 to 9.0 ppm indicate partial 
degradation of RG19A. The spectra also had peak between 0.82 and 2.637 ppm in the high field region indicating formation of aliphatic hydrocarbons of lower molecular weight as shown in Fig. 2(b).

compared and it was found that RG19A displayed a major -1cm  for ring vibration represented RG19A degradation (Fig.1b).
1H-NMR spectra of RG19A showed peaks between 
7.43 and 8.27 ppm representing protons of two aromatic rings. A peak at 7.99 ppm refered to the aromatic protons 
meta to dimethylamino group. The cluster of peaks observed in between 7.78 to 8.273 ppm were due to the aromatic protons present in the ring carrying sulfone group. Signals between 2.46 to 4.01 ppm were due to methylene and methyl protons as shown in Fig. 2(a).M.A. Kumar et al.

mineralized RG19A to a greater extent.
Parshetti et al. (2010) demonstrated the formation of 
sulfonated aromatic amines during methyl orange 
degradation by Kocuria rosea  MTCC 1532 that was 
-1supported by a peak at 1045 cm  for S=O stretching vibration 
in the products. This describes that the cells of K. rosea  
MTCC 1532 did not eliminate the sulfone group completely. Similarly, Saratale et al. (2009) demonstrated the degradation 
of RG19A using Micrococcus glutamicus  NCIM 2168 and 
identified two intermediates; 2-aminobenzene sulfonic acid with 2-chloro-4, 6 diamine-(1, 3, 5) triazine-3-amino benzene sulfonic acid) and 3, 4, 6-triamino-5-hydroxy naphthalene-2,7-disulfonic acid. These two intermediates contained sulfone derivatives; but in the present investigation  
the cells of A. xylosoxidans  strain APZ eliminated the sulfone 
groups. The FT-IR spectra of biotransformed products as shown in Fig. 3(b) did not have any specific peak value supporting the presence of sulfonic group, as well in the mass spectra as shown in Table 1. Thus, from the economical as at 22.669 min. The above said two compounds are poly 
unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) possessing antibacterial property (Melo et al., 2014). Naphthalene (MW=128) was the 
final product to elute out at 8.859 min that was also observed during RG19A degradation using Micrococcus glutamicus 
NCIM2168 (Saratale et al., 2009) and Navy Blue HE2R using 
Exiguobacterium  sp. RD3 (Dhanve et al., 2008).
The values of COD and aromatic amine reduction 
-1were 89 and 73%, respectively, for 100 mg l  RG19A which 
was considered as parameter to evaluate mineralization by 
the cells of A. xylosoxidans  strain APZ. It is evident that cells 
consume intermediates as nutrients during 
biotransformation (Saratale et al., 2009). Elimination of 
S=O groups may be achieved by assimilation of sulfates for 
synthesis of cellular material required by A. xylosoxidans 
strain APZ. The azoic and sulfonic groups initially present in 
RG19A were not found in the FT–IR spectra of the products. 
The sulfonic acid derivatives were also absent in the mass 
spectra of products, which is an indication that the strain had  M.A. Kumar et al.

APZ could be a best a reliable catalyst for degrading and mineralizing sulfonated textile colorants.
The activities of extracellular oxido reductases of A. 
xylosoxidans  strain APZ were elucidated to understand the 
cleavage of naphthalenyl azo ring of RG19A (Table 2). The ring cleavage is mediated by generation of free radicals which leads to spontaneous cleavage (Saratale et al.,  2011).
The reductive cleavage of N=N bond is initiated by 
azoreductase to release aromatic amines (Chang et al.,  2001; 
Chang et al.,  2000). LiP helps in oxidation of phenolic groups 
which is further attacked by water molecules to produce phenyl diazine and finally oxidizes to generate nitrogen (Chivukula and Renganathan, 1995). The conversion of o-
phenols to o-quinone is catalyzed by tyrosinase (Kalme et al., 
2009). Conclusively, the reductase and oxidases were required for degradation and mineralization of RG19A by A. 
xylosoxidans strain APZ.
The result of phytotoxicity assay is tabulated in Table 
3 and it was found that the seeds when treated with RG19A exhibited low germination percentage when compared with the seeds treated with control and biotransformed products.
The length of radicle and plumule, as well as total 
chlorophyll content was comparatively lesser in case of seeds treated with RG19A. The lengthening of plumule and radicle 
in the case of the products may be attributed to the reason tha t 
RG19A had been mineralized. The results of the 
phytotoxicity assessment indicate that RG19A was toxic but 
their products of biotransformation were of reduced toxic nature (Kumar et al. , 2016).
RG19A biotransformation was catalyzed by 
oxidoreductases induced by A. xylosoxidans  strain APZ. The 
products of biotransformation were analyzed using spectral and chromatographic techniques. The phytotoxicity assays, 
confirmed the non-toxic nature of mineralized products. Furthermore, A. xylosoxidans  strain APZ eliminated the 
sulfone from RG19A which is of greater importance to the industries.
