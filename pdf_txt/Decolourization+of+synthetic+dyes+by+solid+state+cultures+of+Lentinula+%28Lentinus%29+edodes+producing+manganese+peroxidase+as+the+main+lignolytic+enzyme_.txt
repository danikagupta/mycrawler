Abstract The production of ligninolytic enzymes
(laccase and Mn-dependent peroxidase) by the white-
rot fungus Pleurotus pulmonarius (FR.) Quélet was
studied in solid-state cultu res using agricultural and
food wastes as substrate. The highest activities of
laccase were found in wheat bran (2,860±250 U/L),
pineapple peel (2,450±230 U/L), and orange bagasse
(2,100±270 U/L) cultures, all of them at an initial
moisture level of 85 %. The highest activities of Mn
peroxidase were obtained in pineapple peel cultures
(2,200±205 U/L) at an initial moisture level of 75 %.
In general, the condition of high initial moisture level
(80–90 %) was the best condition for laccase activity,
while the best condition for Mn peroxidase activity was
cultivation at low initial moisture (50 –70 %). Cultures
containing high Mn peroxidase activities were more
efficient in the decolorization of the industrial dyes
remazol brilliant blue R (RBBR), Congo red, methylene
blue, and ethyl violet than those containing high laccase
activity. Also, crude enzymatic extracts with high Mn
peroxidase activity were more efficient in the in vitro
decolorization of methylen e blue, ethyl violet, and
Congo red. The dye RBBR was efficiently decolorized
by both crude extracts, rich in Mn peroxidase activity or
rich in laccase activity.Introduction
White-rot fungi are known for their ability to degrade or
modify lignin by enzymatic processes. The major enzymes
associated with the lignin-degrading ability of white-rot
fungi are lignin peroxidase (LiP, EC 1.11.1.14),
manganese-dependent peroxidase (MnP, EC 1.11.1.13), ver-
satile peroxidase (VP, EC 1.11.1.16), and laccase (EC
1.10.3.2) (Maciel et al. 2012 ). All these enzymes act via
the generation of free radicals which represents an efficient
way to gain access to their substrates. White-rot fungi usu-
ally secrete one or more of the ligninolytic enzymes in
different combinations. Generically, white-rot fungi can be
distributed into four groups, according to their ability to
produce laccases and peroxidases (LiP, MnP, and VP)
(Kuhar et al. 2007 : (1) laccase and both peroxidases, MnP
and LiP ( Trametes versicolor ,Bjerkandera adusta ); (2)
laccase and at least one of the peroxidases ( Lentinula
edodes ,Pleurotus eryngii ,Ceriporiopsis subvermispora );
(3) only laccase ( Schizophyllum commune ); and (4) only
peroxidases ( Phanerochaete chrysosporium ). The most fre-
quently observed ligninolytic enzymes among the white-rot
fungi species are laccases and MnP and the least are LiP and
VP (Maciel et al. 2012 ).
The demand for application of ligninolytic enzymes in
industry and biotechnology is ever increasing due to their
use in a variety of processes. Ligninolytic enzymes have
potential applications in a large number of fields, including
the chemical, fuel, food, agricultural, paper, textile, and
cosmetic industrial sectors in addition to others (Karigar
and Rao 2011 ). These enzymes are also directly involved
in the degradation of various xenobiotic compounds. Due to

DOI 10.1007/s12223-013-0253-7the fact that ligninolytic enzymes are basically nonspecific,
they are able to attack a series of molecules chemically
similar to lignin including pesticides, polycyclic aromatichydrocarbons, synthetic polymers, and synthetic dyes
(Maciel et al. 2012 ).
Mushrooms of the genus Pleurotus are very easy to
cultivate (Cohen et al. 2002 ). The two most important
species cultivated in large scale are Pleurotus ostreatus
and Pleurotus pulmonarius (formerly Pleurotus sajor-
caju). In nature, they grow on wood, usually on dead
standing trees or on fallen l ogs. Various substrates that
contain lignin and cellulose can be used for Pleurotus
cultivation such as wood chips, corn cob, rice straw,
cotton stalks, waste hulls, and other agricultural wastes,
some of which can be recycled and upgraded for use asanimal feed or for preparation of other products (Cohen
et al. 2002 ). These substrates are also frequently used to
study the production of MnP and laccase by Pleurotus
s p pi nb o t hs u b m e r g e da n ds o l i d - s t a t ec u l t u r e s . P.
pulmonarius , when cultured under submerged and
solid-state conditions using wheat bran as a substrate,produces laccase as the main extracellular enzyme
(Souza et al. 2002 ). The capability of P. p u l m o n a r i u s
to decolorize textile dyes in both types of cultures has
already been described. This capability of the fungus
was mainly due to its laccase activity if one considersthat the Mn peroxidase production was very low in
those cultures (Tychanowicz et al. 2004 ; Zilly et al.
2002 ). More recently, however, it has been found that
when P . pulmonarius was cultured in wheat bran solid-
state medium with a low initial moisture level, it pro-
duced elevated amounts of both enzymes Mn peroxidaseand laccase (Souza et al. 2006 ). The objective of this
study was to compare the production of laccase and Mn
peroxidase by P . pulmonarius in solid-state cultures
using different agricultural residues at several initial
moisture levels. An attempt was also done to evaluate
the capability of P . pulmonarius and its ligninolytic
enzymes to decolorize some synthetic dyes.
Material and methods
Waste materialSeven agricultural residues were used in this work, and they
were obtained from local producers: yellow passion fruitwaste, orange bagasse, banana stalk, pineapple peel, corn
cob, rice hull, sugar cane bagasse, and wheat straw. All
residues were washed and dried in an air-circulating ovenat 50 °C until their weight became constant. The dried
materials were then milled, and the resulting products wereused as substrates. Wheat bran was obtained from the local
market and used without modification.
Microorganism
P . pulmonarius CCB-19 was obtained from the Culture
Collection of the Botany Institute of São Paulo. It was
cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium for 2 weeks
at 28 °C. When the plates were fully covered with themycelia, mycelial plugs measuring 10 mm in diameter were
made and used as inocula.
Culture conditions
The cultures were performed in cotton-plugged Erlenmeyer
flasks (250 mL) containing 5 g of one of the following nine
substrates: yellow passion fruit waste, orange bagasse, ba-
nana stalk, pineapple peel, corn cob, rice hull, sugar canebagasse, wheat bran, or wheat straw. The following salts
were added to give a final salt concentration of (in milligram
per gram): K
2HPO 4,1 ;M g S O 4·7H 2O, 0.2; and
CaCl 2·2H 2O, 0.1. Water was added to obtain initial moisture
levels varying from 50 to 90 %. A total of nine different
moistures were tested. The pH of the media was 6.0±0.1.
Prior to use, the mixtures were sterilized by autoclaving at
121 °C for 15 min. Each flask received three mycelial plugsand was incubated statically under an air atmosphere at 28 °C
and in complete darkness. After 10 days of cultivation,
fungal growth was measured by glucosamine estimation ofthe fungal cell wall (Scotti et al. 2001 ).
Extraction of enzymesAfter 10 days of cultivation, a volume of 50 mL of cold
water was added to the contents of each flask. The mixtureswere stirred for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for
10 min. The supernatants obtained were stored at 4 °C and
used as crude enzyme extracts.
Enzyme assays
The laccase activity was determined by measuring the oxi-
dation of 1 mmol/L 2,2 ′-azino bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-
sulphonic acid (ABTS) in 50 mmol/L sodium acetate buffer(pH 4.5). Formation of the cation radical of ABTS was
monitored at 420 nm ( ε=36 L mmol
−1cm−1) (Hou et al.
2004 ). The Mn peroxidase activity was assayed spectropho-
tometrically by following the oxidation of 1 mmol/L
MnSO 4in 50 mmol/L sodium malonate, pH 4.5, in the
presence of 0.1 mmol/L H 2O2. The reaction was initiated
by adding H 2O2, and the rate of Mn3+–malonate complex
formation was monitored by measuring the increase inFolia Microbiolabsorbance at 270 nm ( ε=11.59 L mmol−1cm−1) (Wariishi
et al. 1992 ).
In vivo dye decolorization experiments
To test the ability of P . pulmonarius cultures to decolorize
synthetic dyes, each dye was membrane filtered through a
0.45-μm cellulose nitrate filter and mixed with the cultures
previously autoclaved, to a final concentration of 200 ppm.After 10 days, the residual dyes in the cultures were
extracted firstly with 50 mL of water followed by 50 mL
of a mixture of methanol/acetone/water (1:1:1). Dye disap-pearance was determined spectrophotometrically by moni-
toring the absorbance at the wavelength of maximum
absorbance for each dye: remazol brilliant blue (RBBR),595 nm; ethyl violet, 596 nm; methylene blue, 665 nm; poly
R-478, 530 nm, and Congo red, 497 nm. In control cultures,
either the dye or the fungus (abiotic control) was omitted. Tocalculate the residual dye in the cultures, the total dye
extracted with water and organic mixture in the abiotic
control was considered as 100 %.
Dye decolorization by crude enzyme extractsA volume of 0.5 mL of each dye to give a final
concentration of 100 ppm and 0.5 mL of crude enzymeextract were added to 4.0 mL of 50 mmol/L malonate
buffer, pH 4.5, containing 1 mmol/L MnSO
4and
0.1 mmol/L H 2O2. The mixtures were incubated in a
rotary shaker at 40 °C for 2 h. Dye disappearance was
determined spectrophotometrically by monitoring the ab-
sorbance at the wavelength of maximum absorbance foreach dye. Boiled crude enzyme extracts were used as
negative controls. For determination of dye decoloriza-
tion by crude enzyme extracts at pH 6.5, malonatebuffer was replaced by phosphate buffer.
Statistical analysisThe data were analyzed by Student's ttest and one-way
ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test ( p<0.05)
using the statistical program pack GraphPad Prism®
(Graph Pad Software, San Diego, USA). All data are
presented as mean ± SD of three independentexperiments.
ChemicalsThe enzymatic substrates were obtained from Sigma
Chemical Corp., St Louis, MO. PDA was obtained fromDIFCO Laboratories, Detroit, MI. All other reagents
were of analytical grade.Results
Influence of the substrates and the initial moisture
levels on the production of P . pulmonarius
ligninolytic enzymes
The influence of the substrates on the growth of P.
pulmonarius and on the activity of ligninolytic enzymes
was evaluated using eight agricultural residues (bananastalk, corn cob, orange bagasse, rice hull, sugar cane
bagasse, wheat straw, pineapple peel, and yellow pas-
sion fruit waste) and wheat b ran. The initial moisture
level of these cultures was 75 % (Table 1). After
10 days, all media were completely colonized by the
mycelial biomass. Fungal chitin hydrolysis into N-
acetylglucosamine was used to determine the fungal
biomass. This analysis showed that P . pulmonarius grew
well in all solid systems, but that orange bagasse, yel-low passion fruit waste, pin eapple peel, and wheat bran
were the best substrates for growth. Under the condi-
tions used in this experiment, laccase was the mainligninolytic enzyme produced by the fungus. The
highest laccase activities were obtained by using the
following substrates: wheat bran (830±90.0 U/L), pine-
apple peel (1,400±100 U/L), orange bagasse (1,800±
160 U/L), and yellow passion fruit waste (1,600±180 U/L). Mn peroxidase activities were low, with the
exception of the pineapple peel cultures, where a high
activity of Mn peroxidase (2,200±205 U/L) was present.
The effect of the initial moisture level on the pro-
duction of ligninolytic enzymes was tested using four
substrates: wheat bran, pineapple peel, corn cob, andorange bagasse (Fig. 1). In pineapple peel cultures
(Fig. 1a), both enzymes were produced at high amounts,
with the initial moisture level of 80 –90 % being the
best condition for the production of laccase (around
2,400 U/L) and an initial moisture content of 70 –75 %
as the best condition for the production of Mn peroxi-dase (around 2,000 U/L). The substrate for which the
initial moisture level had the strongest effect on the
production of enzymes was corn cob (Fig. 1b). The
initial moisture level of 85 –90 % was the best condition
for the production of laccase (900 –1,000 U/L) whereas
very low Mn peroxidase activities were detected in thefiltrates. The best initial moi sture level for the produc-
tion of Mn peroxidase was 50 –65 % (500 –600 U/L), a
condition for which the production of laccase was verylow. Laccase was the main ligninolytic enzyme pro-
duced by the fungus in wheat bran cultures, and its
production was positively affected by increases in theinitial moisture level. The hi ghest laccase activities were
obtained with an initial moisture level of 85 % (2,860±Folia Microbiol250 U/L) (Fig. 1c). It is interesting to point out that in
orange bagasse cultures, the production of laccase wasenhanced (up to 2,000 U/L) by elevating the initial
moisture level, and a low Mn peroxidase activity was
found in all cultures, less than 100 U/L even in culturesdeveloped with low initial moisture level (Fig. 1d).Effect of the initial moisture level on the capability

The fungal cultures developed with initial moisture levels
of 60 and 85 % were able to decolorize RBBR completely.The other dyes were partially decolorized in the following
order: Congo red > ethyl violet > methylene blue > polyR 478
(Table 2). Alcoholic extracts from mycelia and residual sub-
strates showed that less than 8 % of the dyes were adsorbed by
the mixture of fungi plus substrate.
Capability of crude extracts from P . pulmonarius corn cob
cultures to decolorize synthetic dyes with high and low Mn
peroxidase/laccase ratios
The selection of corn cob culture extracts for the in vitro
decolorization experiments was based on two main points:first, in corn cob cultures, it was possible to obtain the
lowest and highest Mn peroxidase/laccase ratio, at 60 and
85 % of initial moisture levels, respectively (Fig. 1); second,
the corn cob crude extracts were clear due their low amount
of natural colored pigments, when compared to other crude
extracts. Corn cob culture extracts were tested for their
ability to decolorize the synthetic dyes under two different
conditions: (a) to obtain the best condition for Mn peroxi-dase activity (50 mmol/L malonate buffer, pH 4.5, with
1 mmol/L MnSO
4and 0.1 mmol/L H 2O2) and (b) to obtain
the best condition for laccase activity (50 mmol/L phosphatebuffer, pH 6.5). The results are shown in Fig. 2. Both crude
extracts (from 60 and 85 % initial moisture content cultures)
efficiently decolorized RBBR. The crude enzyme extractsobtained from cultures developed with an initial moisture
level of 60 % were more efficient to decolorize the dyes
methylene blue, ethyl violet, Congo red, and poly R-478.
Discussion
The potential application of ligninolytic enzymes in biotech-
nology has stimulated investigations for selecting promisingenzyme producers and for finding convenient substrates to
obtain large amounts of low-cost enzymes. Wheat bran is the
most commonly used substrate for the cultivation of white-rotfungi in solid-state cultures. However, the list of possibilities
is very large and includes several lignocellulolytic wastes such
as cane bagasse, corn cob, wheat straw, oat straw, rice straw,and food processing wastes such as banana, kiwi fruit, and
orange wastes (Alexandrino et al. 2007 ; Couto 2008 ). Even
so, it is worth to search for new substrates, especially if theyare available in large amounts, allow the growth of white-rot
fungi without further supplementations, and facilitate the ob-
tainment of valuable products. Recently, yellow passion fruitTable 2 Decolorization of synthetic dyes by solid-state cultures of P.

Fig. 2 In vitro decolorization of industrial dyes by P . pulmonarius
corn cob crude extractsFolia Microbiolwaste was tested by our group as a substrate for growth and
production of ligninolytic enzymes by several white-rot fungi
with results comparable to those obtained with wheat bran(Zilly et al. 2012 ). In the present work, the main oxidative
enzyme produced by P . pulmonarius was laccase. This result
is in agreement with the general observation that laccase is themain ligninolytic enzyme for the genus Pleurotus (Arora and
Sharma 2010 ). However, corn cob cultures developed under
low moisture levels produced elevated levels of Mn peroxi-dase. By varying only the initial moisture level, the use of corn
cob as a substrate allowed the obtainment of crude extracts
rich in either laccase or Mn peroxidase. Another point worthyof being emphasized is the elevated activity of Mn peroxidase
obtained in pineapple peel cultures. To our knowledge, this is
the first report of the use of pineapple peel to produceligninolytic enzymes.
Textile industries consume large volumes of water and
chemicals for wet processing of textiles. The presence ofvery low concentrations of dyes in effluents is highly visible
and undesirable (Nigam et al. 2000 ). Due to their chemical
structure, dyes are resistant to fading on exposure to light,water, and many chemicals (Poots and McKay 1976 ), and
decolorization of textile dye effluents does not occur when
they are treated aerobically by sewerage systems (Willmott
et al. 1998 ). Many white-rot fungi have been intensively
studied in connection with their ligninolytic enzyme pro-duction and their decolorization ability (Boer et al. 2004 ;
Chagas and Durrant 2001 ; Jarosz-Wilko łazka et al. 2002 ;
Kasinath et al. 2003 ; Pointing and Vrjmoed 2000 ).
However, most studies on dye decolorization have been
carried out using liquid or solid cultures on agar plates,
which do not reflect the natural living conditions (i.e., inwood and other lignocellulosic substrates) of the white-rot
fungi. Our results show that solid-state cultures of P.
pulmonarius were able to decolorize, at least partially, all
dyes tested. In addition to this, our results demonstrate the
dye decolorization capability of corn cob culture extracts
rich in laccase or Mn peroxidase activities. The employmentof ligninolytic enzyme preparations can bring considerable
benefits over the direct use of white-rot fungi, considering
that preparations can be more easily standardized, facilitat-ing accurate dosage. Enzyme application is simpler than the
use of microorganisms, and it can be rapidly modified
according to the characteristics of the dye or dyes to beremoved. Furthermore, analysis of metabolite compounds
produced by enzyme preparations is easier than analysis of
metabolites produced when the whole white-rot fungus isused.
An additional advantage for using the corn cob culture
extracts instead of those obtained with wheat bran or pine-apple peel is the low amount of natural colored pigments in
corn cob. This allows the use of corn cob crude extracts in
experiments of decoloriza tion without any additionaltreatments, because the color of the extracts does not inter-
fere with the determination of residual dyes. From the re-
sults obtained in this work, it is possible to suggest that Mnperoxidase was the main enzyme responsible for the decol-
orization of polyR 478, Congo red, ethyl violet, and meth-
ylene blue. Our data also suggest that laccase and Mnperoxidase cooperated in the RBBR decolorization process.
To elucidate the mechanisms involved in the dye decolori-
zation by the ligninolytic enzymes of P . pulmonarius as well
as to evaluate more properly the toxicity of the decolorized
products, it is necessary to conduct experiments using puri-
fied preparations.
