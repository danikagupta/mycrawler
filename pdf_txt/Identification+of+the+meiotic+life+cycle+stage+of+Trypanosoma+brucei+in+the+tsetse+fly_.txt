Sequential production of gametes during meiosis
in trypanosomes

Meiosis is a core feature of eukaryotes that occurs in all major groups, including the early
diverging excavates. In this group, meiosis and production of haploid gametes have beendescribed in the pathogenic protist, Trypanosoma brucei , and mating occurs in the salivary
glands of the insect vector, the tsetse ﬂy. Here, we searched for intermediate meiotic stages
among trypanosomes from tsetse salivary glands. Many different cell types were recovered,including trypanosomes in Meiosis I and gametes. Signi ﬁcantly, we found trypanosomes
containing three nuclei with a 1:2:1 ratio of DNA contents. Some of these cells were under-going cytokinesis, yielding a mononucleate gamete and a binucleate cell with a nuclear DNAcontent ratio of 1:2. This cell subsequently produced three more gametes in two furtherrounds of division. Expression of the cell fusion protein HAP2 (GCS1) was not con ﬁned to
gametes, but also extended to meiotic intermediates. We propose a model whereby the twonuclei resulting from Meiosis I undergo asynchronous Meiosis II divisions with sequentialproduction of haploid gametes.https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-021-02058-5 OPEN

diverse deep-branching protist lineages notable for their
range of unique features1–3. As excavates diverged early in
eukaryote evolution, shared eukaryote attributes, such as meioticsex
4, shed light on the nature of the last common ancestor.
Meiosis-speci ﬁc genes are present in several excavate genomes5,
with experimental evidence for genetic exchange in Giardia6and
the Kinetoplastea7–11. While various mechanisms of genetic
exchange such as cell fusion may explain the production of
hybrids in some of these organisms12, the pattern of gene
inheritance in crosses of Trypanosoma brucei indicates that
meiosis is involved13, and cells in Meiosis I and haploid gametes
have been found in the salivary glands (SGs) of the tsetse ﬂy
vector, where trypanosome mating occurs14,15.
InT. brucei , meiosis starts with a diploid epimastigote cell that
sequentially expresses MND1, DMC1 and HOP1 —three meiosis-
speciﬁc proteins key to chromosomal recombination during
Meiosis I5—and ends with the production of haploid gametes of
two types14,15(Fig. 1). Each type of gamete has a single haploid
nucleus and a kinetoplast (the tightly packaged mitochondrial
DNA of trypanosomes) associated with the single ﬂagellum, but
in about half the gametes there is an extra kinetoplast15. In try-
panosomes, the kinetoplast and the basal body (BB) of the ﬂa-
gellum are physically connected by a ﬁlamentous structure, the
tripartite attachment complex (TAC)16,17. The presence of p166,
a component protein of the TAC18, was demonstrated for both
kinetoplasts in 2K1N (two kinetoplasts, one nucleus) cells, but no
visible ﬂagellum was associated with the extra kinetoplast found
in these gametes15. The one kinetoplast, one nucleus (1K1N) and
2K1N conformations may represent male and female gametes,
though there is no evidence to support this from studying their
interactions in vitro15. There is currently a gap in knowledge
about the process by which the haploid gametes arise from the 4C
cell in Meiosis I prophase (meiotic divider, Fig. 1).
To close this gap, we aimed to identify intermediate stages in
trypanosome meiosis. This is not straightforward as meiotic
dividers and gametes are found in small numbers in the SGs ofinfected tsetse ﬂies
14,15. Nonetheless, if these sexual stages are
present, it follows that intermediates should also be found. The
identity of potential meiotic intermediates could be con ﬁrmed if
they expressed meiosis-speci ﬁc proteins, but much the same
cellular machinery is used for Meiosis II and mitotic division, so
there is a dearth of suitable candidates. On the other hand, there
are gamete-speci ﬁc proteins, such as HAP2 (hapless 2 or gen-
erative cell speci ﬁc1, GCS1), which might serve to identify cells in
the later stages of meiotic division. HAP2 is thought to have
appeared early in eukaryote evolution and is a key proteininvolved in the fusion of the membranes of gametes or mating
cells in protists, plants and invertebrates19–26. HAP2 is homo-
logous to viral fusion proteins; the surface loops of the trimeric
protein insert into the membrane of the opposite gamete, causingmembrane fusion
25. HAP2 was thought to be on the surface of
only one of the two fusing gametes, e.g. the minus gamete in the
single-celled alga, Chlamydomonas ; the male gamete in the
malaria parasite, Plasmodium and the plant Arabidopsis19; how-
ever, the ciliate Tetrahymena expresses HAP2 on cells of all
mating types22.I n T. brucei , there is a HAP2 homologue on
chromosome 10 (Tb927.10.1077023,26), but its expression and
function are yet to be elucidated in trypanosomes.
Here we used expression of HAP2 as a means to identify
gametes and intermediate stages in meiosis in T. brucei . The
discovery that some intermediates had multiple nuclei with dif-
ferent DNA contents provided an unexpected clue that formed
the basis for a model of trypanosome meiosis.
Results and discussion
Relative numbers of meiotic dividers, gametes and inter-
mediates . Meiotic dividers and gametes are most abundant in the
tsetse SGs around 21 days post infection, several days before
dividing epimastigotes and infective metacyclics come to dom-
inate the population. They occur in a ratio of approximately 1:4,
e.g. for strain 1738, there were 48 meiotic dividers and 211
gametes, and for strain J10, 17 meiotic dividers and 72 gametes,
an overall total of 19% meiotic dividers and 81% gametes. The
two types of gametes (1K1N and 2K1N) are usually produced in
approximately equal numbers, e.g. for a total of 405 gametes in
strain 1738, there were 199 (49%) 1K1N and 206 (51%) 2K1Ngametes, and for strain J10, 32 (44%) 1K1N and 40 (56%) 2K1N
gametes; however, there was a predominance of 2K1N gametes in
strain TREU 927, where a total of 220 gametes comprised 45
(20%) 1K1N and 175 (80%) 2K1N gametes.
If meiotic dividers and gametes occur together in the SG-
derived population, the intermediate stages must also be present,
so we carried out a systematic screen of the whole SG-derived
trypanosome population, classifying each cell as either a known
morphological type (trypomastigote, epimastigote, metacyclic,
meiotic divider, gamete) or a potential meiotic intermediate; the
latter were de ﬁned as trypanosomes with multiple nuclei and/or
kinetoplasts, which could not be classi ﬁed as normal dividing
trypomastigotes or epimastigotes
27. For this experiment, we used
two genetically modi ﬁed clones of strain J10 (J10 YFP::HOP1
PFR1::YFP and J10 YFP::DMC1 PFR1::YFP ), allowing us to
unequivocally identify cells in meiosis by the expression of the
yellow ﬂuorescent protein (YFP)-tagged meiosis-speci ﬁc genes
HOP1 andDMC1 . Among 236 cells examined, there were 17 (7%)
meiotic dividers, 72 (31%) gametes and 50 (21%) potential
meiotic intermediates (Supplementary Table 1), which were
examined further.
Among the potential meiotic intermediates, we expected to ﬁnd
trypanosomes with two kinetoplasts and nuclei (2K2N), resulting
from division of the 4C nucleus of the meiotic cell (Fig. 1), but
also present were large numbers of 3K2N, 3K3N and 4K2N cells,
besides smaller numbers of other categories of multinucleate/
multikinetoplast cells (Table 1); this result was con ﬁrmed by
analysis of three clones from two other Trypanosoma brucei
brucei strains, adding a further category of 3K1N cells (Table 1).
It is usually straightforward to identify trypanosome kinetoplasts
by their small size relative to the nucleus after DNA staining and
their position adjacent to the proximal end of the ﬂagellum, but
here the relative sizes of the kinetoplasts in a single cell were
variable, as previously observed for gametes15; moreover, the
association with a ﬂagellum was often obscure and sometimes1K1N

Meiotic dividers expressing the meiosis-speci ﬁc proteins MND1, DMC1
or HOP1 have the morphology shown for the 4C trypanosome: a large
posterior nucleus, two kinetoplasts, and two ﬂagella14. Haploid (1C)
gametes are of two types: one kinetoplast, one nucleus (1K1N) and 2K1N15
and it is assumed that four are produced from each trypanosome thatenters meiosis. The question mark signi ﬁes the current gap in knowledge
about intermediate stages in meiosis.ARTICLE COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-021-02058-5
2 COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY |           (2021) 4:555 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-021-02058-5 | www.nature.com/commsbiothe nucleus and kinetoplast overlapped. Hence, some kinetoplast
identi ﬁcations may have been erroneous and we therefore needed
additional criteria to identify organelles.
Identi ﬁcation of organelles . The BB can be recognized using a
monoclonal antibody speci ﬁc for tyrosinated α-tubulin (YL1/228),
which accumulates at the base of the ﬂagellum29; tyrosinated α-
tubulin is also a marker for newly formed microtubules, since
they become detyrosinated with time30,31. We therefore used
YL1/2 immuno ﬂuorescence to verify whether each kinetoplast
was associated with a BB (Fig. 2). While this was the case for both
kinetoplasts in dividing procyclics from culture, as reported byothers29–31, usually only the posterior BB was stained in meiotic
dividers (9 of 10) and dividing epimastigotes (4 of 6) isolated
from tsetse SG (Fig. 2b, c); the lack of YL1/2 signal implies
the absence of a pool of tyrosinated tubulin associated with theanterior BB and old ﬂagellum. In 13 1K1N gametes, the single
kinetoplast was invariably associated with a BB as expected
(Fig. 2e), but this was the case in only 3 of the 17 2K1N gametes
(Fig. 2f), although we previously demonstrated that the TAC
protein p166 was associated with both kinetoplasts in 2K1N
cells
15. Thus, YL1/2 did not provide a reliable means to identify
the BB, and indirectly the kinetoplast, in trypanosomes with
known morphologies, raising doubts about the interpretation of
YL1/2 signal in putative meiotic intermediates such as those
shown in Fig. 2g–k. The numbers of BBs and Ks did not always
tally (e.g. Fig. 2g–i, k), though in some cells the intensity of
ﬂuorescence at the posterior could have obscured a faint BB
signal (e.g. Fig. 2i). While two prominent BBs were visible in
intermediates with two ﬂagella (Fig. 2g, h), this was not always the
case (Fig. 2i), and conversely, two strongly stained BBs were
present in trypanosomes with a single ﬂagellum (Fig. 2j).
As an alternative means to identify kinetoplasts, their
mitochondrial location was veri ﬁed by dual ﬂuorescence of 4,6-
diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining the kinetoplast DNA
and green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP) targeted to the mitochon-
drial lumen via the N-terminal import signal peptide of frataxin
Tb927.3.1000 (1738 Mito GFP , Fig. 3a–e). All kinetoplasts in 1K,
2K, 3K and 4K cells co-localized with frataxin ﬂuorescence,
implying that all kinetoplasts were inside the mitochondrion,
though this might be inevitable in cells with a highly rami ﬁed
mitochondrion (e.g. Fig. 3c).
As the large size of some kinetoplasts made them dif ﬁcult to
distinguish from nuclei by DAPI staining alone (e.g. Figs. 2e
and3e), nuclei were visualized using a histone 2B fusion proteinTable 1 Morphology of predominant types of meiotic

Four data sets are listed, comprising data from salivary gland-derived trypanosomes of ﬁve
different recombinant clones from three strains of T. b. brucei (J10, 1738, TREU 927). Overall, a
total of 56 cytospins of pooled, dissected salivary glands were examined, derived from ~950tsetse ﬂies (J10, 12 cytospins, ~200 ﬂies; 1738 Mito GFP , 5 cytospins, ~100 ﬂies; 1738 H2B::GFP ,
31 cytospins, ~500 ﬂies; TREU 927, 8 cytospins, ~150 ﬂies). Only the most numerous cell types
(≥10%) in one or more trypanosome clones are shown; percentages relate to the total number
of cells categorized ( N).

COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY |           (2021) 4:555 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-021-02058-5 | www.nature.com/commsbio 3(1738 H2B::GFP , Fig. 3f–j). H2B is a very stable nuclear marker,
as it is part of the nucleosome core and remains bound to nuclear
DNA throughout the cell cycle, except for a brief period duringDNA replication. H2B mRNA levels are maximum during S
phase of the cell cycle
32,33, congruent with the coupling of DNA
and histone synthesis in eukaryotes. Hence, we assume that all the
H2B synthesized during Meiosis I subsequently partitions equally
among the haploid nuclei of the gametes. This is supported by
observation: all 48 meiotic dividers and the majority of gametes
(204 of 211, 97%) expressed H2B::GFP in the nucleus in SG-
derived trypanosomes of T. b. brucei 1738 H2B::GFP PFR1::YFP .
As there is a single copy of H2B::GFP per diploid nucleus
(Supplementary Fig. 1), only half the gametes will inherit a copy
and be capable of synthesizing H2B::GFP de novo.
An intriguing observation was that some of the meiotic
intermediates appeared to have nuclei of different sizes, judging
by the intensity of both the H2B and DAPI ﬂuorescence (e.g.
Fig. 3h, j), whereas a trypanosome undergoing binary ﬁssion
typically has nuclei of the same size. To quantify this phenomenon
more precisely, we measured H2B nuclear ﬂuorescence in
multinucleate cells.
Quantitation of nuclear DNA content using H2B::GFP
expression . We measured the relative ﬂuorescence of H2B::GFP
in each nucleus of individual binucleate (2N) and trinucleate (3N)
cells, recording cell morphology at the same time; examples of
cells with nuclei of markedly different ﬂuorescence intensities are
shown in Fig. 4a–j. A total of 232 cells were measured, comprising
190 2N and 42 3N trypanosomes. Among the 190 2N cells, there
were 34 normal dividing trypomastigotes or epimastigotes,
assumed to have nuclei of equal size; the remaining 156 2N cells
had been categorized as meiotic intermediates and either had
nuclei of approximately equal ﬂuorescence intensity or nuclei that
appeared unequal. Correspondingly the per cell ratios of nuclear
ﬂuorescence intensities for the 190 2N cells showed a bimodal
distribution, with peaks centred on 0.5 and 1.0 (Fig. 5a). Since
ﬂuorescence intensity is proportional to the amount of H2B::GFP,which in turn is proportional to the amount of nuclear DNA, the
nuclear DNA contents of some 2N cells are in a 1:2 ratio and the
simplest interpretation is that these are 1C and 2C nuclei (thoughin principle the 1:2 ratio also applies to 2C:4C nuclei or any
multiple of this).
For each 3N cell, one nucleus was visibly more ﬂuorescent than
the other two, which were of approximately equal intensity.
Figure 5b shows the ratio of the nuclear ﬂuorescence intensity of
each small nucleus compared to the large one in each 3N cell; the
unimodal distribution is centred on 0.5, indicating a 1:2 ratio
between each small nucleus and the larger one in the same 3N
cell, i.e. one 2C and two 1C nuclei.
The presence of 1C nuclei is direct and unequivocal evidence
that these 2N and 3N cells are intermediates in meiosis. It is
unlikely that they result from fusion of a gamete with another cell,
as intraclonal mating is rare in trypanosomes
34,35. For example,
when SG-derived trypanosomes of red and green ﬂuorescent
clones of T. b. brucei were mixed in vitro, yellow ﬂuorescent cells
were observed routinely in mixtures of different strains but
seldom in intraclonal mixtures36. Here in contrast, the putative
meiotic intermediates were relatively abundant in SG-derived
populations, e.g. 2N and 3N trypanosomes with unequal nuclei
together comprised just over half (142, 53%) of the 267 cells
identi ﬁed as putative meiotic intermediates in the SG-derived
population of 1738 H2B::GFP PFR1::YFP .
The order of the 1C and 2C nuclei from posterior to anterior of
the 3N cell varied (Supplementary Table 2), suggesting that either
of the 2C nuclei divides, and as the two 1C nuclei pull apart on a
longitudinal spindle, one moves past the remaining 2C nucleus,
so that the ﬁnal, and most abundant, conformation is 1C 2C 1C
(Fig. 4f). Similarly, the order of the 1C and 2C nuclei in 2N cells
varied: among 87 2N cells, the 1C nucleus was posterior in 43
cells (50%) (Fig. 4a, b), anterior in 34 (39%) (Fig. 4c) and adjacent
to the 2C nucleus in 10 (11%) (Fig. 4d, e).
In 13 3N cells, cytokinesis was almost complete, separating
cells with one or two nuclei (Fig. 4g–j); in seven cases, the
daughter cell cleaving from the posterior was either a 2K1N or

cell cleaving from the posterior of a gamete was a 2N
trypanosome with nuclei of different ﬂuorescence intensities
(Fig. 4j). In normal trypanosome cell division, the daughter cell
forms at the posterior of the mother cell and inherits the newly
constructed ﬂagellum30,31, so there is a clear distinction between
mother and daughter cell. Here, identi ﬁcation of the daughter cell
was based on its posterior position only.
Expression of HAP2 in gametes and potential meiotic inter-
mediates . We investigated whether expression of the gamete
fusion protein HAP2 would identify gametes and their pre-
cursors. Procyclic cells were transfected with a HAP2::YFP fusion
construct designed to integrate into the HAP2 locus with control
of expression via the endogenous promoter, 5 ′and 3 ′untrans-
lated regions (UTRs). Transfected T. brucei clones were then
cycled through tsetse ﬂies to track expression of the HAP2 fusion
protein by ﬂuorescence microscopy in different life cycle stages.
For all four T. brucei strains tested (TREU 927, STIB 247, J10,
1738), expression was detected only among trypanosome life
cycle stages in the ﬂy SGs, where meiosis occurs and gametes are
found14,15; no expression was detected in midgut procyclics or
proventricular trypanosomes.
We analysed SG-derived trypanosomes from TREU 927 in
depth (Table 2). Of the 1478 cells examined, 656 (44.3%)
expressed HAP2. The vast majority of these cells (649 of 656,
99%) were either gametes (185 of 656, 28%, including both 1K1N
and 2K1N) or potential meiotic intermediates (464 of 656, 71%),
as previously de ﬁned. Unexpectedly, 2 of the 12 meiotic dividers
expressed HAP2, though these cells are in an early stage of
meiosis (prophase I), but only negligible numbers of HAP2
expressors were found among epimastigotes, metacyclics and
other trypomastigotes. While the majority of gametes expressed
HAP2, 16% (35 of 220 gametes) were negative, comprising 10
1K1N and 25 2K1N gametes (Table 2). It is possible (though
unlikely given the small proportion) that these non-expressors
were female gametes, as only male gametes express HAP2 in
other organisms; however, HAP2 is present on both mating
partners in ciliates22.

HAP2 fusion protein, sometimes at the cell posterior (Fig. 6a), but
other cells showed several spots of bright ﬂuorescence and/or
generalized ﬂuorescence throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 6b); this
might suggest storage of HAP2 in cytoplasmic vesicles before
deployment21. There was no discernible difference between the
cellular distribution of HAP2 expression in 1K1N and 2K1N
gametes. Similar patterns of expression were observed among the
potential meiotic intermediates (Fig. 6c–e). When these HAP2-
expressing meiotic intermediates were categorized by the
numbers of nuclei and kinetoplasts, the largest categories, ordered
by size, were: 3K2N (21%), 3K1N (19%), 2K2N (15%), and 4K2N
(13%), the same cell types that featured prominently among
potential meiotic intermediates in other T. b. brucei strains
(Table 1). Expression of HAP2 strengthens the case that these
cells are the precursors to gametes, i.e. meiotic intermediates that
appear late in the process.
Model of meiosis . To summarize, we have three separate lines of
evidence that point to particular cell morphologies as potential
meiotic intermediates: unusual cell conformation with multiple
nuclei and/or kinetoplasts; two or three nuclei with different
DNA contents in the same cell; expression of HAP2. We now
need to link these intermediates into a logical series of events in
order to formulate a model of meiosis in T. brucei .
Both the meiotic divider (intermediate A, Fig. 7) and the 3N
cell with one 2C and two 1C nuclei (intermediates C1 and C2,
Fig.7) have a total DNA content of 4C and therefore the 3N cell
should follow on from the meiotic divider, presumably with a
stage in between in which the 4C nucleus undergoes a
conventional reduction division yielding two 2C nuclei, without
cytokinesis (intermediate B, Fig. 7). Intermediate B has two 2C
nuclei of equal size and could be confused with mitotically
dividing epimastigotes or trypomastigotes. However, in these cells
the nuclei and kinetoplasts appear in a particular order from the
posterior of the cell; thus dividing epimastigotes are NKNK,
dividing trypomastigotes are KNKN and epimastigote/trypomas-
tigote dividers are NKKN27. Hence, 2N cells that do not conform
to one of these arrangements, particularly because they have 3 or
4K (49/59, 83%, Supplementary Table 3), are potential candidates
for intermediate B; some examples are shown in Fig. 3g, i. We
infer that kinetoplast replication occurs in intermediate B, though
no more than two ﬂagella were evident, and this is consistent withthe multiple K observed in intermediates C1 and C2, where the
majority (67%, 35 of 52) had 3 or 4 K (Supplementary Table 3).
Intermediates A, B and C1 were indistinguishable in terms of cell
size parameters (Fig. 8a, b), implying that the changes affecting
the nuclei and kinetoplasts do not alter cytoplasmic volume or
cell shape.
When C1 divides (intermediate C2, Fig. 7), one of the 1C
nuclei together with one or more kinetoplasts, pass into the ﬁrst
gamete produced; examples are shown in Figs. 2g and 4g–j. The
dimensions of this gamete concur with those of free gametes
(Fig. 8c). The remaining cell is a 2N intermediate with a total
DNA content of 3C, as it has one 2C and one 1C nucleus
(intermediate D1, Fig. 7); examples are shown in Fig. 4a–c. The
number of K was variable, though note that some K might be in
the process of replication: among the 74 D1 cells observed, 20
(27%) were 1K2N, 37 (50%) were 2K2N, 13 (18%) were 3K2N
and the remaining 4 (5%) were 4K2N (Supplementary Table 3).
Production of a second 1C gamete from D1 would require the
construction of a new ﬂagellum (intermediate D2, Fig. 7),
presumably necessitating K and BB replication, though it is also
feasible that growth of the new ﬂagellum initiates from one of the
existing BBs in cells with multiple Ks. Though the examples
shown in Fig. 4d, e have two ﬂagella, it is uncertain how such cells
complete cytokinesis, as only three examples of intermediate D3
were found, none with very good morphology. The dimensions of
D1 and D2 cells occupy a wide range, partly overlapping with that
of C2-Mother, the predecessor of D1 (Fig. 8d), suggesting changes
in shape during transition from C2 to D2 (Fig. 7).
The remaining cell with one 2C nucleus (intermediate E1,
Fig.7) is also dif ﬁcult to identify with con ﬁdence, as it resembles a
gamete, because of its relatively long ﬂagellum and small body.
However, gametes are either 1K1N or 2K1N, so gamete-like
3K1N cells are likely to be intermediate E1 (e.g. Fig. 4k), and the
appearance of a new ﬂagellum de ﬁnes intermediate E2 (Fig. 7). Of
the 30 intermediate E1/E2 cells identi ﬁed, 13 (43%) were 2K1N
and 17 (57%) were 3K1N (Supplementary Table 3); examples are
shown in Figs. 4k, l and 6c.
The following stage of division into two 1C gametes
(intermediates F1 and F2, Fig. 7) is easier to identify, as there
are two nuclei of equal ﬂuorescence (assumed to be 1C) in a
characteristic gamete-like cell with one or two ﬂagella; of the
36 such cells, 4 (11%) were 1K2N, 14 (39%) were 2K2N and 18
(50%) were 3K2N (Supplementary Table 3); examples are shown
in Fig. 4l–p. Presumably construction of a new ﬂagellum requires
replication of the K-BB complex, as for the transition from
intermediate D1 to D2. Depending on the number of kinetoplasts
present, these dividing cells may produce two 1K1N gametes or
one 1K1N and one 2K1N gamete in an asymmetric division, as
shown in Fig. 4o, p; this inconsistency may account for the fact
that equal proportions of 1K1N and 2K1N gametes are not always
achieved.
The sequence of events shown in Fig. 7roughly agrees with the
relative proportions of HAP2 expressors (Table 1), assuming that
HAP2 is maximally expressed by gametes and their immediate
precursors. Thus, 3K2N (21%) and 3K1N (19%) cells were
prominent among HAP2 expressors, comprising intermediates
F1/F2 and E1/E2, respectively, while intermediates C1/C2 (3K3N)
were less well represented (3%) (Table 1). Although HAP2
expression is restricted to gametes or mating cells in other species,
here HAP2 expression in intermediate stages may re ﬂect the fact
that gametes are being formed sequentially rather than just at the
end of meiosis. HAP2 is unlikely to be in its ﬁnal conformation/
location in these intermediate stages to avoid the possibility of
premature membrane fusion; we envisage that only mating-
competent gametes should express HAP2 in its active form25,26.
However, in experimental crosses polyploid hybrids are oftenTable 2 Expression of HAP2::YFP in salivary gland-derived

not only occurs between gametes but also between gametes and
intermediates. This might be facilitated by premature expression
of HAP2 in 2C cells such as E1/E2 since these cells are high HAP2
expressors.
Conclusion
Of the potential meiotic intermediates we have identi ﬁed here, the
2N and 3N trypanosomes with 1C and 2C nuclei were key to
developing a model of the likely sequence of events during
meiosis. Although the model we have derived does not ﬁt with the
symmetrical nuclear divisions described in textbook accounts of
eukaryote meiosis, asymmetrical meiotic division is not unusualamong eukaryotes, a case in point being human oogenesis, where
polar bodies are sequentially discarded, leaving only a single
haploid egg40. However, the asynchronous division of nuclei
suggested here occurs within the shared cytoplasm and would
require a special control mechanism, perhaps only feasible in cellswith a closed mitosis and meiosis.
The model differs signi ﬁcantly from trypanosome mitosis,
which follows a strictly ordered sequence of events, with kine-
toplast and BB replication at the start, allowing the new ﬂagellum
to be constructed during nuclear DNA synthesis, leading to
cytokinesis after all structures have been replicated
16,30,31.
Meiosis follows this pattern up to a point, but then kinetoplast
replication and construction of new ﬂagella become, of necessity,
uncoupled from nuclear DNA synthesis, because the 4C nucleus
needs only to divide. Kinetoplast replication could be linked to
nuclear division, but a ﬁxed pattern of events was not obvious,
which is dif ﬁcult to reconcile with the tight control of the mitotic
cell cycle in trypanosomes30,31.
Although meiosis is thought to be an ancestral eukaryotic
feature4,5, trypanosomes represent an ancient, deeply branching
lineage, with the insignia of this divergence displayed in unique
organelles, such as the kinetoplast and glycosome. It is therefore
not unreasonable to suggest that the evolution of meiosis
in trypanosomes may have taken a different path after diver-
gence, constrained by the need to coordinate reduction division
with replication of the ﬂagellum in a rigidly structured,
asymmetric cell.
Experimental procedures
Trypanosomes . The following tsetse-transmissible strains of T. b.
brucei were used: T. b. brucei J10 (MCRO/ZM/73/J10 CLONE 1),
1738 (MOVS/KE/70/EATRO 1738), TREU 927 (GPAL/KE/70/
EATRO 1534), and STIB 247 (MALC/TZ/71/STIB 247). Procyclic
form trypanosomes were grown in Cunningham ’s medium
(CM)41supplemented with 15% v/v heat-inactivated foetal calf
serum, 5 µg/ml hemin and 10 µg/ml gentamycin at 27 °C. Tsetse
were infected with trypanosomes and dissected essentially as
described previously14,15.
Transfection . Procyclic trypanosomes were transfected by electro-
poration, antibiotic selected and cloned as previously described14.

ofGFP in a plasmid construct targeted for integration into the

14;HAP2::YFP ,HAP2 (GCS1,

UTR downstream and targeted for integration into the endogenous
locus. This plasmid construct and t wo transfected trypanosome lines
(TREU 927, STIB 247) were kindly supplied by Eva Gluenz and
Keith Gull (University of Oxford, UK).
Microscopy . Fly SGs were dissected directly into CM to recover
trypanosomes spilling from the broken ends of the glands. Ali-
quots of the supernatant were ﬁxed for 30 min in 2% w/v par-
aformaldehyde (PFA) at room temperature (RT) and then spread
on microscope slides using a cytospin. Slides were stained with
DAPI in VECTASHIELD mounting medium (Vector Labora-
tories) and viewed using a DMRB microscope (Leica) equipped
with a Retiga Exi camera (QImaging) and Volocity software
(PerkinElmer). The whole area of the cytospin was scannedsystematically from top to bottom, capturing GFP/YFP, DAPI
and phase-contrast images of each trypanosome.
Immuno ﬂuorescence . Fly SG were dissected directly into CM as

at RT, followed by permeabilisation with 1:200 v/v Triton in
distilled water for 7 min at 4 °C. Cells were pelleted by cen-
trifugation and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS), then allowed to settle on a round glass coverslip. Cells
were incubated with 2% w/v bovine serum albumin (BSA) for
30 min at RT, followed by a further 30-min incubation with the
primary antibody (YL1/2, Merck Life Science) diluted 1:100 in
2% BSA. Following removal of the primary antibody by three
PBS washes, a secondary anti-rat IgG ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate-
conjugated antibody (Life Technologies) diluted 1:200 in 2%
BSA was added and incubated for 30 min at RT. After three PBS
washes, cells were stained with DAPI in VECTASHIELD
mounting medium and imaged as above.
Image analysis . Digital images were collated and analysed using
ImageJ ( http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij ). The previously described
macro for measurement of DNA content in DAPI-stained cells15
was used to measure GFP ﬂuorescence in H2B::GFP nuclei by
changing the target image (green instead of blue channel).
Mensural data were collected from 554 SG-derived trypanosomes
of 1738 H2B::GFP PFR1::YFP , comprising total cell length

Statistics and reproducibility . Mensural data were subjected to
principal component (PC) analysis using the statistical package IBM
SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 26. Two uncorrelated factors,
PC1 and PC2, accounted for 84% of the variance. Extracted scores
for PC1 and PC2 were plotted for each trypanosome.
Reproducibility . Multiple tsetse transmission experiments were
performed in order to obtain suf ﬁcient SG trypanosomes for ana-
lysis. Most experiments were done with T. b. brucei 1738, either
wild type or various genetically modi ﬁed clones, but experiments
were also repeated with other strains of T. b. brucei .
Sample sizes . In total, 56 cytospin preparations of trypanosomes
from pooled SG dissected from ~950 tsetse ﬂies were examined by
phase contrast and ﬂuorescence microscopy. Morphology of 753
trypanosomes was examined and 554 cells were subject to men-
sural analysis; 1478 trypanosomes were examined for HAP2
expression. Additional transmission experiments were done with
1738 wild type to recover trypanosomes from tsetse organs for
immuno ﬂuorescence using YL1/2 antibody.
