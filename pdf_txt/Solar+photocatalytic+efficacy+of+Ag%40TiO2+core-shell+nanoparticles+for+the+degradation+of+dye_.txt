ABSTRACT  
MB decolarization  with pure TiO 2 and Ag doped TiO 2 based photocatalytic system w ere investigated under 
UV-A and UV -Visible  conditions . Different ratios of Ag were used as metal dopant. 1% Ag-TiO 2 incre ased 
the decolorization  efficiencies of MB and  MO dyes , also  the kapp constant  enhanced  under UV -A and UV -
Visible conditions.  A central composite analysis  showed  the effect  of initial dye concentration, pH, Ag -TiO 2 
concentration and the reaction time of photocatalytic process under UV -A irridation  in both dyes . The 
photocatalytic degradation pathways of both dyes by Ag doped TiO 2 catalyst were obtained in this study. 
According to these res ults, the application of Ag-TiO 2 catalyst  are proved to be more  effective than pure 
TiO 2 catalyst for both  MB and MO  removal . The toxicity test of Daphnia Magna shows that non toxic 
wastewater discharge to the receiving environment could be possible with photocatalytic degration by 
Ag-TiO 2 catalyst.  
Keywords:  dye, decolorization , doped TiO 2, optimization, photocatalytic , toxicity.  
 
 
1. Introduction  
 
Different d yes applied in many industries such as textile , paint, ink, plastics and cosmetics processing are 
mostly poorly biodegradable pollutants and cause  serious environmental  problem due to the toxicity and 
carcinogenicity  (Mirkhani et al. , 2009; Çifçi et al. , 2015 ). Advanced Oxidation Processes are common ly 
used to remove of dyes and toxic chemicals  (Zhang et al. , 2014 ; Pekakis et al. , 2006). In recent years, 
doping metals (e.g. Pd, Au and Ag)  on the surface of TiO 2 is one of the common  methods applied to 
increase the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 under visible light and sunlights (Sun et al. , 2014).  Among the 
metals, silver has attracted intense attention to increase photocatalytic activity and stability and can act 
as electron traps aiding electron –hole separation  (Arabatzis et al. , 2003 ). Researches  show ed the 
improving in the efficiency of some dyes with Ag doped TiO 2 (Padikkaparambil et al. , 2012; Mirkhani et 
al., 2009 ). However, there are a few reasearche s about  the examination of the effects of process 
parameters by statistical methods.  Response surface methodology (RSM) is very usefu l, quick and cost -
effective  statistical method that are obtained optimization of different parameters and exhibit s the 
intera ction of these parameters ( Khataee  et al. , 2010; Kasiri et al. , 2011 ; Barka et al. , 2014).  
The aim of this study is to evaluate  MB and MO decolorization  by pure TiO 2 and Ag doped TiO 2/UV process 
and also examin ing the effects of  initial dye concentration, pH, catalyst concentration and time  on 
photocatalytic  degradation  by using response surface methodology. Also, toxicity is evaluated at optimum 372  ÇIFÇI  
condit ions by Daphnia Magna  and identified the interm ediate products and degradation pathways of both  
dyes .  
 
2. Materials and methods  
 
2.1.Chemicals and analytical methods  
Meth ylene blue (MB, Cat No: 1.05045 ), methyl orange (MO, Cat No: 1.01322 ), silver nitrate (AgNO 3, Cat 
No: 1.01510), glacial acetic acid ( Cat No: 1.00056), Ethanol ( Cat No: 1.00986) hydrochloric acid (Cat No: 
1.00314 ), and so dium hydroxide (Cat No: 1.06462 ) were purchased from Merck. Titanium (IV) butoxide 
(Cat No: 86910, purum ≥97.0%) was obtained from Fluka. All aqueous solutions were prepared  by using 
deionized water . The determina tion of Methylene Blue (MB , λ = 664 nm ) and Methyl Orange (MO , λ= 464 
nm) at different irradiation times were analyzed by UV –vis spectroscopy in a Shimadzu UV -2401 PC 
instrument in standard quartz cells.   
Residues and intermediates of MB and MO were determined by ESI -MS using a n AB Sciex (Models 3200 
QTRAP) and MS was operated in positive and negative ionization mode with electrospray source 
ionization (ESI). The positive ionization mode was operated under the following conditions: curtaing gas 
(CUR): 20, ion spray voltage (IS): 5500, DP: 90 and EP: 10. The negative ionization mode was operated 
under the following conditions: curtaing gas (CUR): 20, ion spray voltage (IS): -450, DP: -70 and EP: -12. 
Pure and  Ag doped TiO 2 catalysts were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM) -energy 
dispersive X -ray analyzer (EDX) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). The particle 
morphology was observed by a scanning electron microscope (FE I-QUANTA FEG 250) with secondary 
electron detector (Everhardt Thornley ETD detector) operated at 5 kV, 2.5 spot and 60000x mag and 
equipped with an attachment for the Energy dispersive X -ray spectroscopy (EDX) was used for analysis of 
elemental compositions of the photocatalysts. FT -IR was performed at room temperature on a Bruker 
VERTEX 70 ATR and it was used to evaluate and identify the formation of functional groups formed during 
synthesis of the photocatalyst  in the range of 400 to 4000 cm−1. The pH pzc of the sa mples was 
determinated according to the literature ( Asgari et al. , 2013).  
2.2.Preparation of pure and doped TiO 2  
Pure TiO 2 and Ag doped TiO 2 catalysts  were prepared by sol-gel technique  at room temperature . Ethanol 
was slowly added to titanium (IV) butoxide and was stirred for 60 min  (Ethanol:Titanium Butoxide: 10:1 
v/v). A second solution was prepared mixing glacial acetic acid with deionized water (Glacial acetic 
acid:Distilled water: 1:3 v/v) and this  solution was gradually  added to titanium (IV) butoxide and ethanol 
solution and stirring continued  for one hour . Ag-TiO 2 ratios (weigth%) w ere selected as 0.5, 1.0 , 1.5 and 
2.0% Ag  (weight%) was added glacial acetic acid and deionized water solutions for Ag doped TiO 2. After 
that sol was dried at 105  °C for 12 hours and calcinate d in muffle furnace at 450  °C for 2 hours. Pure TiO 2 
was prepared by the same methods of metal doped TiO 2 without any metal additions.  
2.3.Photocatalytic experiments  
The photocatalytic experiments performed with 150 mL quartz beaker  and carried out at Luzchem UV 
Photoreactor equipped with fifteen UV-A (Hitachi, 8W) or UV -Vis light lamps (Sylvania, 8W) at 3 0°C. 
Samples for analysis were collected at 3 m l and through 0. 45 µm cellulo se acetate membranes . NaOH and 
HCl solutions wer e used for pH adjustments in this  study.  
2.4.Central composite design (CCD)  
CCD were used to evaluate the influence of operating parameter s and to determine the optimum Ag/TiO 2 
ratios  for photodegradation  of MB and MO . The CCD matrix w as used in the experiments and designed 
by using the Design Expert . Four factor s were investigated as inital MB or MO concentration (mg  l-1), pH, 
catalyst  concentration ( g l-1) and reaction time (min.) . Total number of experiments w as 30 and the 
experimental design points consists of 2n factorial points (24= 16), 2n axial points  (2x4=8) and 6 replications DECOLORIZATION OF METHYLENE BLUE AND METHYL ORANGE WITH Ag DOPED TiO 2 373

Acute toxicity of initial and photocatalytic treated samples of different times w ere done by Daphnia 
magna (new born daphnids < 24 h) according to ISO 6341 Method (1996). Toxicity tests details w ere given 
at Cifci et al. , 2015. All samples were diluted by 50% and set at pH 8, also 20 ml effective volume was used 
in the test beaker.  
 
3.Results and discussion  
 
3.1.Characterization of pure TiO2 and doped TiO 2 catayst  
Figure 1 shows the SEM images of pure TiO 2 and 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0% Ag doped TiO 2 particles. All the 
morphologies of particles have different shapes of grains with irregular boundaries  and exhibit aggregated 
particles with many smaller crystals. It can be seen that in 2.0% Ag -TiO 2 nanoparticles ha ve increased the 
particle size of TiO 2 nanoparticles. The results of EDX analysis for elemental composition of pure TiO 2 and 
0.5, 1.0 and 2.0% Ag-TiO 2 showed that the weight of Ti (titanium) and O (oxygen) were  the main 
components of the nanoparticles. The atomic ratio  of Ti and O in the nan opartic les were within the range 
of 8.7 -10.5 % and  90.1 -91.3 %, respectively. The atomic ratio  of Ag in the 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5% Ag -TiO 2 were 
obtained 0. 11%, 0.20% and 0. 44%, respectively.  
According to the FT -IR spectra of nanoparticles, four significant peaks were shown at ca. 400 -500, 600 -
800, 1600 -1700 and 2300 -2400 cm-1. The peak around 400 -500 cm-1 assigned to the characteristic 
vibrations of Ti -O-Ti lattice and bending mode of vibrations and at ca. 700 and 800  cm-1 were attributed 
to the strecthing vibrations of Ti –O bonds in the TiO 2 lattice (Bezrodna  et al. , 2004). Peak around 1600 -
1700  cm-1 represented the bending vibrations of the O –H bending which adsorb hydroxyl ions on the 
surface of catalyst pl ays an important role in increasing photocatalitic activity. Comparing the FT -IR 
spectra of the pure and Ag doped TiO 2, significant changes were observed at peaks around 600 -800, 1600 -
1700 and 2300 -2400 cm-1 when Ag doped the TiO 2 surface. The peaks increa sed with escalating Ag weight 
from 0.5% to 1.0%; however in 2.0% Ag -TiO 2 nanoparticles peaks decreased according to 1.0% Ag -TiO 2 
nanoparticles. Furthermore, with doping Ag on to TiO 2 catalayst, there has become a new peak at around 
1500 -1600 cm-1. 
pH pzc values of Ag -TiO 2 did not significantly change between 0 -1% Ag -TiO 2 and they were 6.6, 6.33 and 
6.25 in TiO 2, 0.5% Ag -TiO 2 and 1.0% Ag -TiO 2. However, at 2.0% Ag -TiO 2 pH pzc values increased to 7.05. pH pzc 
value is important due to positively surface charged ( pH<pH pzc) and negatively surface charged (pH>pH pzc) 
of the particles (Khanna and Shetty, 2013).  
3.2.Photocatalytic activity of MB and MO  
In the study, photolysis can be ignored due to very low degradation of MB and MO in the absence of 
catalysts under UV -A conditions. MB removal efficiencies were not significantly changed by 0.5% Ag -TiO 2 
while it was increased from %83 to %99 with %1 Ag doped the TiO 2 catalyst. A similiar result was also 
observed on MO removal. However, the MB or MO decolorization efficienc ies decreased both UV -A and 
UV-Visible conditions when Ag amount increase than 1.0%. The high amount of Ag particles on the TiO 2 
surface decrease the intensity of light through photocatalytic degradation. As a consequence, maximum 374  ÇIFÇI  
MB and MO decolorization were achieved at 1.0% Ag -TiO 2. Moreover, the irridation time decreased from 
120 min. to 90 min with 1.0% Ag/TiO 2 catalyst under UV -A conditions.  
  
 
Figure 1. SEM images of pure TiO 2 and 2.0, 1.0 and 0.5% Ag -TiO 2 nanoparticles  
In UV-Visible  conditions, MB decolorization increased from 18% to 4 4% after 7 h. irridation with 1% Ag -
TiO 2 nanoparticles while MO decolorization increased from 27% to 36 %. Photocatalytic degradation of 
MB and M O were  fitted to pseudo first order reaction kinetics for TiO 2/UV process. Pseudo first order 
kinetics were calculated according to Zaharieva  et al. , 2015  and pseudo first order kinetic constant s are 
given as k app. According to results,  kapp was obtained approximately 2 fold higher with  1.0% Ag -TiO 2 than 
pure TiO 2 catalyst  in MB decolorization while its 3.5 fold higher in MO decolorization.

3.3.Analysis of c entral composite design  
Maximum photodegradation of MB  and MO  were found at the 1.0% weight ratio of Ag-TiO 2 catalyst and 
CCD experiment were done in photocatalytic degradation of MB  and MO  with  UV-A conditions . The 
experimental and predicted result s of MB and MO removal with variable matrix w ere shown in Table 3.

In the CCD experimental and predicted data s of Ag-TiO 2/UV-A process , the results of the quadratic 
regression  model are fitted analysis of variance (ANOVA) at 95% confidence level (p<0.05). The Model F -
value ( 15-18) and P  value Prob > F (< 0.0001) imply  that the model is significant. The larger the magnitude 
of the t -value and smaller the P -value, the more significant is t he corresponding coefficient (Liu and Chiou, 
2005). Moreover, the value of the determination coefficient (R2) and the adjusted determination 
coefficient (adjusted R2) are obtained 0. 9519 and 0.9070  in MB decolarization and 0.9599  and 0. 9225  in 
MO decolarization , respectively and it is recommended that R2 should be more than 0.80 to fit the 
regression model (Daghrir et al. , 2013).  The closing experimental s and predicted values are mean s that 
the model is a good fit in th ese experiments. MB an d MO decolariza tion e quations are given in Eq . 1 and 
Eq. 2, respectively.

(1)  
According to Equation 1, pH value of solution affect s the MB removal efficiency more than the other 
parameters and pH (X2) and time (X 4) are important factors  on MB decolarization. pH (X 2), Ag -TiO 2 
concentration (X 3) and time (X 4) have possitive effect on the photocatalytic degradation of MB. It means 
that the photocatalytic degradation is the most suitable at high pH, high Ag -TiO 2 concentration and high 
reaction time  (Fig. 2). Besides, MB removal decreased  while the inital MB concentration (X1) increased. 
Also, quadratic effect is observed in pH and Ag -TiO 2 concentration  and synergy effect is observed between 
inital MB concentration  and pH ; pH and Ag -TiO 2 concentration; pH and time . MB removal efficiency is 
decreasing  from 100% to 60% at low Ag -TiO 2 concentration and acidic conditions. MB removal obtained 
about 70% even increasing Ag -TiO 2 conc entration from 0.125 to 0.625 g l-1 at pH 3. However, it could be 
increase d to 90% with increasing pH to 9  at low Ag -TiO 2 concentration (0.25 g l-1). 
The expression of MO decolarization percentage by following equation:           
Y=93.27 -8.79*X 1-4.42*X 2+7.65*X 3+7.64*X 4+0.13*X 1X2+6.49*X 1X3+0.56*X 1X4+0.16*X 2X3+1.32*X 2X4-3.51*X 3X4-3.93*X 12-4.52*X 22-5.80*X 32-1.06*X 42 
(2)  
According to Equation 2, all factors have most effect on the respons e factors of MO decolarization and 
the effect of the independent parameters is counted as: inital M O concentration>Ag -TiO 2 
concentration>oxidation time>pH. A similiar result was obtained at other research and it is explained that 
high dye concentration caused the reduction of penetration (Sahoo and Gupta, 2012). Ag-TiO 2 
concentration (X 3) and time (X 4) have possitive effect s on the photocatalytic degradation of MO, while the 
inital MB concentration (X 1) and pH (X 2) have negative. It means that the photocatalytic degradation is 
the most suitable at low inital MO concentration, low pH, high Ag -TiO 2 concentration and high reactio n 
time (Fig . 3). The most important parameter to enhance the MO removal efficiency is initial MO 
concentration and the effects of Ag/TiO 2 and oxidation time are very close to the effects initial MO 
concentration. Besides, quadratic effect is observed in th e inital M O concentration, pH and Ag -TiO 2 
concentration and synergy effect is observed between inital M O concentration and Ag -TiO 2 
concentration; Ag -TiO 2 concentration and reaction time.  MO removal efficieny is decreased to 60% when 
pH 9 and Ag -TiO 2 concentration 0.25 g l-1 or pH 9 and 60 min oxidation time.  
   
Figure 2. Response surface and contour plots of MB decolorization (%) between independent variables  
MB and MO removal efficiencies decrease by increasing the inital MB and MO concentration. High MB 
decolarization was observed at 5, 10 and 15 mg l-1 MB concentration than 20 and 25 mg l-1 MB 
concentration. Xiao et al.  (2008) observed similiar trends and MB degradation was decreased at 20 and 
50 mg l-1 than 5 and 10 mg l-1 MB conc entration. High MB concentrations cause the reduction of light 
penetration into solution and inhibite photogenerated holes or absorbe UV photons by the pollutants 
instead of TiO 2 photocatalyst (Xiao et al. , 2008; Daghrir et al. , 2013). Besides, according t o MB removal, 
MO removal efficiency is affected more than the increase of MO concentration. MO removal efficiency 
was decreased to 56.8% at 25 mg l-1 MO concentratration while MB removal efficiency is 79.5% at 25  
mg l-1 MB concentration.  
DECOLORIZATION OF METHYLENE BLUE AND METHYL ORANGE WITH Ag DOPED TiO 2 377 
Photocatalytic dec olorization efficiency of MB increased with increasing the pH value and similar trends 
were observed in the literature (Xiao et al. , 2008; Lin et al. , 2006). Besides, the adsorption of MB increased 
with increasing pH (Lachheb et al. , 2002). In this study, maximum MB decolorization was observed at pH 
9. On the other hand, maximum MO decolorization was observed in acidic condition at pH 5.  
   
Figure 3. Response surface and contour plots of MO decolorization (%) between four independent 
variables  at central level  
The influence of Ag/TiO 2 concentration, within the range of 0.125 –0.625 g l-1 is evaluated and the MB 
removal rate increased with the increasing  Ag-TiO 2 concentration until 0. 500 g l-1. After 120 min 
irradiation, 71.9% MB decolarization efficiency was observed at 0.125 g l-1 Ag-TiO 2 concen tration and it 
incre ased to 99.6 % MB removal at 0.375 g l-1 Ag-TiO 2 concentration while i t is slightly decreased to 93.4 % 
MB removal at 0.625 g l-1 Ag-TiO2 concentration.  When the initial MB or MO concentrations increase , the 
reaction time increase s in parallel due to the reducing the photogeneration of holes or OH radicals on the 
surface of catalyst.  
3.4.Toxicity Evaluation at optimum conditions  
Photocatalytic oxidation process must be evaluated by toxicity due to the understanding  full of 
minerilization or the toxicity  of intermediate by -products (Saien and Khezrianjoo, 2008). Toxicity assays 
by Daphnia Magna  is ben efical method for evaluation of  toxicity in textile wastewater or dyes ( Meriç  et 
al., 2005a; 2005b). Optimum conditions of MB and MO were selected to evaluate of toxicity by 
photocatalytic proc ess. Toxicity of Daphnia Magna  decreased with  degrading the dye molecules in time 
and there was no observed toxicity after 60 min oxidation time while a pproximately 98 -99% MB or MO 
removal and %38 -40 TOC removal observed after 60 min photocatalytic oxidation. However, TOC removal 
was increased with oxidation time increased from 60 to 120 min  and TOC removal was obtained as 83.3% 
for MO, while it is observed that 45.8% of TOC removal for MB  after 120 min photocata lytic oxidation 
time (Fig. 4).

Decreasing Daphnia Magna  immobilization with increasing oxidation time in both MB and MO dyes 
indicate that breaking of the long chain molecules of dyes and occured nontoxic by -products (Meriç et al. , 
2005b). Besides, more than 95% UV 254 removal showed the high dearomatization in  both systems (Çifçi et 
al., 2015).  
3.3.Paracetamol Residues in treated samples by Ag doped TiO 2 catalysts  
ESI-MS analysis was used to determine the aromatic by -products of MB and MO photo -oxidation  and both 
of MB and MO degradation pathway s are given in Figure 5 a-b. The MS analysis gives six significant m/z 
values which are 114.1, 101.7, 140.1, 123.9, 288.1 and 107.9 m/z in MB degradation while it is  four 
significant m/z values which are 101.9, 240.7, 114.1 and 140.1  m/z in MO degradation .  
MB was degraded to single ring structure  products  and t hree main single ring structure by-products were 
observed in the sample which were at 124 m/z (aminoquinone), 108 m/z (benzoquinone) and 140 m/z 
(Phenylsulfinate ion) . Phenylsulfinate ion at 140 m/z was a lso observed photocatalytic degradation of 
methylene blue on nanocrystalline TiO 2 (Gnaser et al. , 2005).   
MO was separated into two forms  due to  the hydroxyl radical attack the benzene containing SO 3 group 
and phenylsulfinate ion at 140 m/z was observed in the treated samples like MB treated samples. On the 
other hand, product at 241 m/z  could be MO molecules (absence of SO 3) which was given  in literature  
(Baiocchi et al. , 2002). Aromatic structure of intermadiates generate d emethylation reaction s by h ydroxyl 
radicals and the molecule at 212 m/z (both methyl groups absence ) was observed as by oxidation products  
(Mascolo et al. , 2007 ; Baiocchi et al. , 2002 ). After the seperation of methyl  groups , the OH radical s attack 
has become to take place on the –N=N– double bond and the aromatic rings of products w ere degrad ing 
to single ring structure s such as at 124 m/z (aminoquinone) and  108 m/z (benzoquinone) . 
114.1 and 101.7 m/z values were observed in both of the dyes which indicate d that intermadiates were 
degrading  to smaller molecules  such as carboxylic acids group. At the end of the degradation of dyes, 
these carboxylic acids converted to inorgonic ions such as carbon dioxide, nitrate, sulfate, water and 
chlorine (Huang et al. , 2010; Ghauch et al. , 2012).

4. Conclusion  
 
In this study, photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue and methyl orange by using pure TiO 2 and Ag -
TiO 2 were  evaluated. Maximum MB decolarization was observed 1% Ag -TiO 2/UV-A process and it was 
DECOLORIZATION OF METHYLENE BLUE AND METHYL ORANGE WITH Ag DOPED TiO 2 379 
found that 1% (weight) Ag doped TiO 2 increased both the MB and MO removal efficiency from about 80% 
to 99%  at 0.5 g l-1 catalyst concentration after 2 hour photocatalytic degradation . Furthermore, MB and 
MO photodegradation reaction kinetic  constant increased approximately 2 and 3.5 fold hig her by dopping 
1% Ag on the surface of TiO 2 at TiO 2/UV process, respectively. The toxicity of Daphnia Magna was not 
observed in both dyes by Ag -TiO 2 catalyst after 2 h photocatalytic oxidation times and this means that 
both of the dyes can be degraded to n on toxic degradation products. Also, it was examined that the effects 
of the inital MB concentration, pH, Ag -TiO 2 concentration and reaction time on MB decolarization in Ag -
TiO 2/UV-A process. In MB decolarization, pH was the most important parameter  for the photodegradation 
while initial MO concentration was the most  effect the photocatalytic process  in MO decolarization . The 
Response Surface Methodology approach was a useful method for estimation of the influence process 
operating conditions on MB and MO p hotodegradation. Metal dop ed TiO 2 could be enhanced the 
photocatalytic degradation of dyes and the residues products w ere the non toxic in aquatic environment.
